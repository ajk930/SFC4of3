Miller Is well known in San Bernardino,
vhere he has a host of relatives by mar
riage, iiis only living blood relation is
one daughter, who is the wife of James
Haskell, a well known rancher, who is
a partner of Will Singleton at El Casco.
Zliller was a candidate for nomination to
the office of ,Shprifr at the last Repub
lican convention, i ..nnons and Miller
vrcre formerly partners in the mining
business and were interested in turquoise
rnlr.ir.g. Miller had charge of the prop
erty. ; : :,-:'
W. F. Blake, the Manvel Justice of the
Peace, walked up to him and he surren
dered his rifle and a shotsx'n that was
in the shoD, but still retained an autÂ»
mati.- pistol. He has promised to stay in
his shop, and as the little jail is no strong
er than the building be is in he will re
main there under guard. Desperate armed
men are euardlng him and it will not be
easy for him to overpower them. He
Kays that his only regret Is that he did
not get Smithson also. It is believed that
the shooting occurred over a long stand
ing dispute retarding the ownership of
valuable mines.
Smithson. the man who narrowly es
caped death at the hands of Miller, has
resided in this section for many years,
but it Is only recently that he has turned
his hand to mining. He is well known in
San Bernardino, where he was the de
fendant in the hard foucht suit made
against him by the people of the State of
California, backed up by the Rock Springs
Land and Cattle Company, which accused
him of stealing one red calf.

ond rfhot, then fired two shots at Smlth-
Kon...b'Jt, the hcrses starting to run,
Emithson stooped to pick up the lines
Â¦which had fallen on the whiffletree, and
that was all that eaved him, as one bullet
cut the top off the seatback and another
went ov*>r hSs head. Miller then turned
away and walked into town, stopped at
the butcher shop and waited for the citi
zens to come for him.
Fpecial Dispatch To The Call
The witness said that he had seen Dem
ing of Alexander & Green several times
In answer to Untermeyer Seward tes
tified that he understood a "dummy" di
rector to be a' temporary director, and
throughout the examination - the witness
insisted on referring to himself. as a tem
porary director. There was a sharp wran
gle between counsel occasioned by' the
witness handing Guthrie his subpena In
order to.6how that he was one of the
complainant's witnesses.; Untermeyer pro
tested that Guthrie had no right to take
the paper and Guthrie insisted that the
record should show 'the character of the
paper given to him. ;
"MINUTES" ARE PROGRAMMED;
Untermeyer examined Seward at length
as to the circumstances attending the is
sue to him of a temporary certificate of
stock upon which he qualified as a direc
tor. The purpose of the extended showing
as to the acts of the so-called "dummy"
directorate formed in New Jersey when
the shipbuilding company was first or
ganized has not yet been. disclosed, but it
is said that the bondholders of the re
ceiver may attack the legality, of the acts
of the first board. These acts Include the
increase in the capital stock and the ac
quirement of the constituent companies.
The witness said that he personally
paid nothing for his share of stock and
he did not know if any one else had paid
for it. He understood, however, that the
share of stock belonged to him. He in
dorsed the share of stock In blank v and
surrendered It to one of the employes of
the Corporation Trust Company, receiving
no payment. He did not know what be
came of it. .
When the investigation was resumed to
day Frederick Seward, formerly one of
the directors of the United States Ship
building Company and an employe of the
Corporation Trust Company, was recalled
to the stand. He became a director of
the United States Shipbuilding Company
In 1902, at the request of Mr. Deming of
Alexander & Green. The witness could
not say why Deming wanted him to act.
The witness said he had acted as an in
corporator for from fifty to seventy-five
companies while he was employed by Â»the
Corporation Trust Company. He had act
ed as director in fourteen or fifteen more
companies. - . : jv/^
Seward admitted that he did not know
the location of the plants nor the char
acter of the business of several the
companies, and sajd that ae was "under
the impression tTiat the Bethlehem plant
was located at Homestead. Seward and
the other temporary directors acted upon
the increase in the capital stock of the
company to $45,000,000, voted for the issu
ance of securities to the amount of $71,
000,000 and decided other matters of lm
portance. The. trend of trie examination
to-day indicated an intention to attack
the validity of all those transactions.
It is claimed that the original directors
were simply "dummies," and that while
the forms of the law. were closely fol
lowed at all meetings none of the direc
tors were properly holders of stock and
none of their acts were of legal value.
"DUMMY" DIRECTOR RECALLED.
Seward, who had served as a director,
was auestloned for three hours t the In
quiry covering his connection -with the
company from the time Alexander and
Green asked him to serve as a director
until he resigned when the permanent offi
cers were elected. His stay on the stand
was prolonged because he would not ad
mit that he was a mere "dummy" act
ing under the orders of the counsel of the
company.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â The entire time
at to-day's hearing of the United States

organization of the company in New Jer
sey. Frederick Seward, Horace Gould and
Kenneth McLaren, young men connected
with thp Corporation Trusi Company of
New Jersey, who acted either asincor
porators or directors of tlie shipbuilding
combination, were called to the stand and
exa-mined at length as to the circum
stances under which they served the pro
moters of the enterprise.

LONDON, Oct. 16.â The Daily Chron
icle in Ita^flnancial article this morning
states, that the Stock Exchange settle
ment proved disastrous for one of the
largest of the London stock brokerage
firms, Vwhose : losses â¢ are estimated at
Â£1,000,000. The failure of the house was
prevented only by a sort of forced
liquidation of its affairs, so huge and
complicated that the city did not dare al
low the i firm' to fall openly. It ' is sa!d
that the firm's business will be closed and
that It will - disappear.
It : .Is reported 'also that, several other
important firms were, compelled'prac
tically to close or have been assisted by
banks - and financiers to the'extent of
many millions. ~
The other papers say that relief Is felt
that the settlement ; passed off- without
failures. The '. Daily Telegraph describes
It as one of the most distressing accounts
that the Stock Exchange can recall. The
differences to be met were enormous and
the lifting of such a load from the mar
kets caused a buoyancy of prices at the
close. .
According to the Standard all the stocks
affected, which were of -a' highly specu
lative character, have now pasesd into
strong hands. .

â¢ This afternoon a crowd of several hun
dred persons was waiting outside the
church and Â¦ in front of Â¦ the Holland
â¢House, where she who was supposed to
be Mrs. Janeway, but who, in fact, was
Mrs. Platt, was busy In her apartments
packing her trousseau, preparatory to
taking a train for Lakewood later in ine
afternoon. She, too, enjoyed the joke
hugely. Sitting beside her husband in the
parlor car of the train, she. smiled gay^y'
as the Senator chuckled over the manner
in which he had avoided the ordeal of a
public ceremony.
"You needn't feel at all ashamed to be
fooled by a man as sly as the Senator,"
Mrs. Platt said to several reporters, at
which Platl gave another chuckle.
Early to-day Senator Platt emerged
from his apartments In the Fifth Avenue
Hotel an hour earlier than Is his custom,
attired in a new frock coat, gray trous
ers, creased to perfection: patent leather
shoes,' etc. His was the ideal bridegroom's
attire, and his' smiling face helped to
carry out the impression of all concerned
that this was the moraine of his wed
ding, day, when, in fact, he was dressed
for his honeymoon trip.
"Senator Platt was anxious to avoid the
crush and confusion when the service was
being performed." is the substance of a
statement issued by his secretary, who
added that the arrangements for the wed
ding on Sunday #*ere made last week and
that there was" no other reason for se
crecy than the one named. The sugges
tion that- Miss May Wood's threatened
suit hurried the wedding was treated
scornfully by Platt's Intimate friends.
NEW YORK. Oct. 13.â None of Senator
Platt's political triumphs has afforded
him such keen enjoyment as his coup in
misleading his closest friends, who ex
pected him to, marry Mrs. Lillian Jane
way to-day at noon, when, In ' fact, the
couple had been married four days - ago.
The ceremony took place In Mrs. Jane
way's apartments in the Holland House,
with "only their own children and Mrs.
Jarteway's sister present. The Rev. Cr.
David .. J. Burfell, who * has been Platt's
spiritual adviser since the latter's dif

The loss was not discovered until the
close of the festivities and consternation

PRESIDENT PAYS ELOQUENT
TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF
WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMANcapital a fitting memorial to General Wil
liam'Tecumseh Sherman, the man who
did so much to bring to a close the great
Civil War, was started soon after his
death in 1891. â
The work was Undertaken by the So
ciety of the Army of the Tennessee. hl3
old command, and to the members there
of is due the credit for the final accom
plishment of the purpose. '
They raised $11,000 by subscription
among themselves, and secured an ap
propriation' of $30,000 from Congress, mak
ing $41,000 in all, which was thought ade
quate to complete the work as originally
planned. In 1S95 the leading sculptors of
the country were asked to prepare de
signs and twenty-six models were sub
mitted in January, 1896.
On May 27, 1896, the design offered by
Carl Rohl Smith, a Danish- American art
ist, was selected and in November fol
lowing the contract for the work was
awarded to him.
It was soon found, however, that on ac
count of : some unforeseen contingencies
a much larger amount of money was
needed.
The Army of tha Tennessee subscribed
$5000 more and Congress raised its origi
nal appropriation to JSO.OOO, making. $06,
000 In all.
Â¦ The supervision of the work was con
fided to a committee consisting of General
Miles, the Secretary of War and several
members of the Army of the Tennessee,
with the eminent sculptors, St. Gaudens
and Olin Warner, and Architects Bruce
Price and Charles Post as advisers.
Upon receiving the award for the
monument, Carl Rohl-Smlth removed
from Chicago, where he resided, to Wash
ington, and set up his studio on the
ground, but in 1900, while on a short trip
to Denmark In the interest of his work â
which he intended to be his masterpieceâ
he was taken ill and died at Copenhagen
August 20.
Upon his death hla widow undertook
to complete the work by the employment
of other sculptors. Henry H. Kitson of
Boston executed the four baa reliefs.
Stephen Lindlng, a Norwegian artist, the
two groups of "War" and "Peace," and
Lauritz Jensen completed the model of
Sherman and his mount.
The great bronze horse represents such
a mount as General Sherman always pre
ferred â quiet and subdued â but capable of
hard service and good speed. General
Sherman's figure sits erect thereon with
the head turned toward the White House.
Below the horse and rider are four bas
reliefsâ "An Incident In the. Battle of
Missionary Ridge," "The Battle of At
lanta." "The March Through Georgia'.*
and "Sherman in Camp at Night." Eight
medallions represent the following of his
commanders: Logan, Ransom, Grierson,
Blair, O. O. Howard, Dodge, . McPherson
and Smith. On tha terrace base are
four heroic bronze figures, standing on
the corner pedestals, representative of the
men who followed Sherman la his cam
paigns.
On the north side Is the following In
scription:

west sides are two allegorical groups,
"War" and "Victorious Peace." The
height of the statue proper Is seventeen

SANTA CLARA,* Oct. 15.â Observation

they may again be visible when the sun
has revolved upon Its axis'. The spots
were very clear and distinct against the

vestige of the spots -disappeared at 10:30
a. m.,; standard Pacific time. .
; Providing Â£ the large spot on the sun
does not vanish before a revolution of the
sun on its axis is accomplished, it may be
visible again within ' twenty-seven days
six hours, the average time required for
a complete revolution of the sun, if the
sun's . accelerated equatorial motion does
not bring it 'back sooner. Sun spots al

yesterday In the Masonic Temple.
The morning session . was taken
up with the disposition of many
matters that relate to the good
of the order exclusively. At the after
noon session Grand Orator E. H. Hart
delivered a lengthy address. This ,was
followed by eulogies of two past grand
masters, the late E. M. Preston and N.
W. Spaulding.
In the evening there was the constitut
ing of Mill Valley Lodge under dispensa
tion of Marin Lodge of San Rafael.
The Mill Valley Lodg*' is the "baby"
lodge of the year and out of eight new
lodges Instituted during the last year it
is the last one to be constituted. The first
step taken was in July. Within four
weeks from that time the necessary num
ber of charter members had been selected
and a dispensation petitioned for.- Before
the dispensation was allowed sufficient
funds had been collected and a building
was under course of construction. To
day the Masonic Temple is one of the
most imposing structures in Mill Valley.
The building and lodge furnishings cost
nearly $12,000.
Harry A. Klyce, worshipful master of
the lodge, personally supervised the con
struction of the temple and it is complete
In all its appointments. The inside j fur
nishings are especially elaborate and cost
ly, while the electric illuminating para
phernalia Is not surpassed by that of any
Masonic lodgeroom In the State. AH of
the emblems of the order are brought In
relief by a concentration of Incandescent
lamps.
The lodge consists of the most promi
nent residents of Mill Valley as well as
some 'of San Francisco's .foremost busi
ness men. whose domiciles are under the
shadow of Mount Tamalpais. Â»
The temple iÂ£ located on Corte Madera
avenue. The lower floor has been leased
to the city of Mill Valley for municipal
offices.
The officers of, the lodge who were in
stalled by the Grand Lodge" are: Harry
A. Klyce, worshipful master; Louis L.
Janes, senior warden; James' Newlands
Jr., junior warden; Samuel N. Burt,
senior deacon; A. H. Pritchard, Junior
deacon; F. F. Bostwick, treasurer; F. F.

Wilkinson of Polsom
Says He Didn't Cut
His Clothes.
BACRAMENTO, Oct. 15.â The cross-ex
amination of Warden Wilkinson of Fol-
Bom prison was resumed when the cases
of Convicts Wood and Murphy, who es-'
caped from thÂ© prison last July, were
taken up by Justice J. R. Brown this
morning.
The Warden denied emphatically that
he had cut his own clothes, the garments
Â¦which were introduced in evidence by the
prosecution showing they had been cut
with a knife.
Guard Ryan testified that he himself
had locked Murphy in his cell on Sunday
the day before the break, the defense in
tending to show that he could not have
been engaged tn conversation -with other
jrisoners in the prison yard on that day
hatching up a conspiracy to assault the
prison officials in order to escape.
Convict Abbott will be brought down
from the prison to-morrow to testify for
the prosecution.

while acting as director, but could not
recall any of their conversations. He had
been given the minutes of the first direc
tors' meeting before the meeting . was
held. The minutes were a resume of what
was to be done. They Included all of the
documents and resolutions . ready to be
passed. The proceedings were put
through without change. The witness
said that he and his co-directors voted
for the acceptance of the offer contained
in the minutes.
Seward said he had never heard of John
\V. Young before that meeting. He also
said that he did not at that time know
the representative of the Hyde Windlass
Company. Aside from the papers , he
knew nothing -of the Canada company.
He accepted the papers that were sub
mitted to him at the meeting because
they came from reliable persons. He did
not know of the firm of Moore & Sons
and did not know where he had voted
to acquire their plant while he was act
ing as director of the shipbuilding com
pany. .-.,,.
The witness said he had placed no val
uation on the plants separately. He said
he had. however, placed a valuation on
the whole group of yards, and Unter
meyer asked him how he could value the
whole if he- had not valued the plants.
The witness said he had taken the report
of the accountants on the valuation.
Untermeyer sought to show that Sew
ard voted while a director simply as he
was told by the attorneys for the cor
poration and that he had possessed no
knowledge as to the value of the sev
eral properties which he voted to pur
chase. .
EABNS $20 AS DIKECTOB.
The redirect . examination of Seward
brought out the fact that for his services
as director for the -shipbuilding company
he had been paid the sum of $20. Later,
when Untermeyer asked him if he would
have voted the same if it had been _pro
posed to Issue $171,000,000, worth of securi
ties instead of $71,000,000, the witness re
fused to answer. Guthrie had objected
to the question as immaterial, and in, the
end It was agreed to certify the question
to the court, after counsel had exchanged
sarcasm on the subject.
â¢Horace T. Gould of the Corporation
Trust Company, who said that he had
acted as incorporator <â¢ f or ' 100 or more
companies, was the next witness.' He had
two shares of stock in tho shipbuilding
company, but did not pay for them him
self. He said * that he had no personal
interest. In the company and that' he
probably, had had. the two shares of stock
long ennujrh to , indorse them and hand
them back to the Corporation Trust Com
pany. :-".'" : -' . Â¦,Â¦"Â¦..'Â¦
Jvfnneth T. McLaren, secretary of the

could only name three of them. ! He was
sure, hqwever.i that neither Max Pam nor

General Young was chief: marshal I and,

The unveiling ceremony began with

the statue* and then introduced "William
Tecumseh Sherman Thorndyke, who,
from the base of the j pedestal, pulled a
cord and 'two^Immense national flags
slowly parted, unveiling the statue of his

a bunch of flowers, which the little fel

warmly. ,
The President was Introduced/ by Gen

gave him round after round of cheers.
The President's speech was frequently in
terrupted with , applause. The President,
said:
To-day we meet together to do honor to the
memory of one of the great men whom. In
the hour of . her agony, our nation Â¦ brought
forth for her preservation. The Civil War
was not only in the importance of -the issues
at stake and. of the outcome the greatest of
modern times, but it was also, taking Into
account Its duration, the severity of the fight
ing and the size of the armies engaged, the
greatest since the close of the Napoleonic
struggles. 'Among the generals who rose to
high position as leaders of the various armies
in the field are many who will be remembered
in our history as long- as this history It3elf
is remembered. Sheridan, the incarnation of
tlery energy and prowess; Thomas, farslghted.
coolheaded. * whose, steadfast courage, burned
ever highest Â¦ In the supreme moment of the
crisis; McClellan, with his extraordinary gift
for organization; Meade, victor In one of the
decisive battles of all ..time; Hancock, type of
the true .fighting man among the regulars;
LoKan, type of the true lighting: man among
the volunteers â the names of tHese and of
many others will endure so long as our peo
ple ' hold sacred the memory of the fight for
union and for liberty. High among these
chiefs rise the figures of Grant and of Grant's
great- lieutenant, Sherman, whose s>tatue here
In the national capital Is to-day to be un
veiled. It is not necessary h**te to go over
the long roll of Sherman's migrhty feats. .They
are written large throughout the history of
the Civil War. Our memories would be poor
indeed if we did not recall them now, as
we look along Pennsylvania avenue and think
of the great triumphal march which surged
down its length when at the close of the war
the victorious armies of the East and of the
West met here In the caDltal of tho nation"
they had saved. . , Â¦ â¢ '
There is a peculiar fitness in commemorating
the great deeds of the soldiers who preserved
this nation by suitable monuments at the
national caDital. I trust we. shall soon have
a proper statue of Abraham "Lincoln, to whom
more than to any other one man this nation
owes its salvation. Meanwhile, on behalf of
the people of the nation, I wish to congratu-'
late all of you who have been instrumental
in securing the erection of this statue to Gen
eral Sherman.
MUST BE TRUE TO THE PAST.
The living â¢ can best show their respect for
the memory of the great dead by the way in
which they take to heart and act upon the
lessons taught by the lives whieh made these
dead men great. Our homage to-day to ths
memory of Sherman comes from the depths of
our bein*. We would be unworthy citizens
did we not feel profound gratitude toward him.
anfl those like him and under him, who, when
the country called .in her dire need, sprang
forward with such gallant eagernes3 to answer
that call. Their blood and their toll, their
endurance arid patriotism, have made us and
all who come after us forever their debtors.
They left us not merely a reunited country,
but a country Incalculably greater because of
its rich heritage in the deeds which thus left
It reunted. AÂ» a nation we are the greater,
not only for the valor and devotion to duty
displayed by the men In blue, who .won in the
great struggle, for the Union, but also-for the
valor and the loyalty toward what they re
garded as right of the men In gray;, for this
war, thrice focfunattf above .all -other recent
wars in^ Its outcome, left to all of us the.
right of- brotherhood alike with valiant victor
and valiant vanqulFhed.
Moreover," our homage must not only find
expression on our lips; It must also show Itself
forth In our deeds. It la a great and glorious
thing for a nation to be stirred to present
triumph by the splendid memories of -triumphs
in the past. But it is a shameful thing for a
nation, if these memories stir it only to empty
boastings, to a pride that does not shrink
from present abasement, to that self-satisfac
tion which accepts the high resolve and un
bending effort of the father as an excuse for
effortless ease or wrongly directed effort in
the son. We of the present. If we are true
to the past, must show by our 'lives that we
have learned aright the lessons taught by the
men who did the mighty deeds of the past.
We must have in us the spirit which made
the men of the civil war what they were;
the rplrit which produced leaders such as
Sherman; the spirit which gave to the aver
age soldier the grim tenacity and resourceful
ness that made the armies of Grant and Sher
man as formidable fighting machines as thin
world has ever seen. We need their rugged
ness of body, their keen and vigorous minds,
and above all. their dominant' quality of force
ful character. Their lives teach us in our
own lives to strive after not the thing which
Is merely pleasant, but the thing which It Is
our duty to do. The life of duty, not the life
of mere ease or mere pleasure â that is the
kind of < life which makes the great man as it
makes the great nation.
MANIFOLD DUTIES OF PEACE.
We cannot afford to lose* the virtues which
made the men of '61 to' '05 great in war. No
GOPHER'S HOLE
YIELDS THE COIN
man is warranted in feeling pride In the deeds
of the, army and navy of the past if. he does
not back up the army and navy of the pres
ent. If we -are farsighted in our patriotism
there will be no let up in the work of building
and of keeping at the highest point of efn
clency a navy suited : to tne part the tinned
States must hereafter play in the world, ana
of making and keeping our â¢ email regular
army, which in the event of a great war can
never be anything but the nucleus around
which our volunteer armies must form them
selves, .the best army of its size to be 'found
among the. nations. : ; : -- '- ' 't '
. So much for our duties in keeping unstained
the honor roll our fathers made in war. It
is of even mere instant need that we should
show their spirit of patriotism in the affairs
of peace. The duties of peace are with us'
always; those of war are but occasional; and
with a nation as with a man, the worthiness
of life depends upon the way In which the
everyday duties â¢ are done. The home duties
are the vital duties. The nation is nothing
but the aggregate of the families within Its
border; and if the average man â¢ Is â¢ not Â¦ hard
working, ' just and fearless in his dealings
with those about him, then our average of
public life will in the end be low, for the
stream can rise no higher than Its source.: But
in addition we need to remember that a peculiar
responsibility rests upon the man in public
life. We meet in the capital of the nation.
In the city which owes its existence to the
fact that it is the seat of the national Govern
ment. It is well for us, in this place and at
this time, to remember that exactly as there
are certain homely qualities, the lack of which
will prevent the most brilliant man alive from
being a useful soldier to his country, so there
are certain homely qualities for the . lack of.
which in the public servant no shrewdness or
ability can atone. The greatest, leaders,
whether In war or in peace, must, of course,
show a peculiar quality of genius, but the most
redoubtable armies that . have ever existed
have been redoubtable because the average sol
dier, the average officer, possessed to a high
degree such comparatively simple ' qualities as
loyalty, courage- and hardihood. And so the
most successful governments are those in
which the average public servant possesses
that variant of loyalty which we call patriot
ism, together with common sense- and honesty.
We can as little afford to tolerate a. dishonest
man in the public service as a coward in the
army. The murderer takes a single life; the
corruptlonist in public .life, whether he be
bribe-giver or bribe-taker, strikes at the heart
of the commonwealth. . -
WRONGDOING- IN" OFFICE.
Â¦ In every public service, as In every army/
there will be wrongdoers, there will occur mis
deeds. This cannot be avoided, but vigilant
watch must be kept and as soon as discovered
the wrongdoing must be stopped and the wrong
doer punished. Remember that In popular gov
ernment we must rely on the people themselves
alike Tor the punishment and the reformation.
Those upon whom our institutions cast the
initial duty of bringing malefactors to the bar
of Justice must' be diligent in its discharge;
yet in the last resort the success of their ef
forts to purge the public service of corruption
must depend upon the attitude of the courts
and of the juries drawn from the people.
Leadership is of avail only so far as there is
wise and resolute; public sentiment behind it.
In the long run, then, it depends upon us
oursolves. upon us. the people as a whole,
whether this Government Is or is not to stand
In the future as it has stood in the past, and
my faith that it will show no falling off is
based upon my faith In the character of our
average citizenship. The one supreme duty
is to try to keep this average high. To thip
end it is well to keep alive the memory of
those men who are tit to serve as examples of
what Is loftiest and best In American citizen
ship. Such a man was General Sherman. Toi
very few In any generation Is It given to render
such services as he rendered; but each of us
In his degree can try to show something of
those qualities of character upon which. Â¦ in
their sum, the high worth of Sherman rested â
his courage, his kindliness, his clean and sim
ple living, his sturdy good sense, his manli
ness and tenderness In the intimate relations
of life and, finally, his Inflexible rectitude of
soul and his loyalty to all that in this. free re
public is hallowed and symbolized by the na
tional flag.
TBIBUTES TO GBEAT SOLDIEB.
As soon as the applause following the
President's address had subsided, David
B. Henderson of Iowa, former Speaker of
the House of Representatives, spoke on
behalf of the Army of the Cumberland.
In eulogy of General Sherman he said:
The language of this statute tells what he
fought for â peace. To recount his battles Is to
give a history of the Civil War. His march
to the isea Is generally regarded as his greatest
campaign,, but It "is an error. It was a bril
liant campaign â the world so rated It â but it
did not come up to the. genius and grandeur of
the campaign immediately following It. when
he carried practically the same army from
Savannah ' to North Carolina. That was the
greatest work of Sherman's life. Could the
living- and the dead of the -Civil -War unite In
one voice they would say of Sherman, "He was
a great man. he was a great soldier, he was a
pure patriot." .. .
For the Society of the Army I of the
Tennessee, Representative Charles H.
Grosvenor of Ohio, in a long speech, said
of General Sherman:
His fame will go forward to future genera
tions as the fame of a great American soldier,
not confined by the limits of any society, but
expanding and growing and glorious as the
honor of any American soldier ever shall be.
General Thomas J. Henderson of Illinois
eulogized Sherman on behalf of the So-,
ciety of the Army of the Ohio.
Speaking for the Society of the Army of
the Potomac, General Daniel E. Sickles
said:
The ceremonies 'closed "with the bene
diction pronounced by the Right Rev.
Henry Yates Satterlee, Bishop of Wash
ington.
Sherman fills a conspicuous page In the his
tory of great commanders. He will always
hold high rank in the estimation of Americans
as one of our most heroic figures. He grouped
â¢with Sheridan and Thomas among the chief
lieutenants of Grant.

YOU WILL BE ALL
SMILES AGAIN
Forget Your Stomach and You'll
Have a Santa Clans Face.
HOW TO DO IT.
If there is one thins: more than all others
that will give a man a forlorn and friendless
appearance and make him morbid and
"cranky" and disagreeable, that thins is dys-
pepsia. It makes one forget his friends and
become morose and irritable. He is so wrapped
up in his own misery that he Is Inconsiderate
of every one else. Believed of this terribls
and depressing aliment, he again becomes a
good fellow and a man among men.
IS mart's Dyspepsia Tablets are beyond ques-
tion the most effective and popular remedy
ever offered to the sufferers of this terrible
disease. The thousands and - thousands of
cures they have brought about and the enor-
mous increase of their sales fully attest the
truth of this statement.
They are, above all, a natural remedy. They
possess exactly the same properties that the
gastric Juices and other digestive fluids of the
stomach possess, and they actually do the di-
gestive work of the stomach and enable that
organ to rest and recuperate and become sound
and well. They act In a mild, natural manner
and cause no disturbance in the digestive or*
gana. They prevent any fermentation of tha
food which causes sour stomach. In fact, un-
der their influence the subject forgets that he
has a stomach and his resulting cheerfulness
presents a great j contrast to his former dejec-
tion.
Millions of boxes of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets are sold annually and they are but In the
j dawn of their popularity. Every mall brings
letters of thanksgiving from grateful ones who
have been cured of this terrible disease. The
following is one of hundreds received each
week:
Rev. J.' R. Hoag of Wymore.Nebr., writes:
"For six years I have been troubled with dys-
pepsia. Last fall I became xttry much alarmed
at some symptoms. of heart trouble and came
to believe there was a sympathetic relation be-
tween the two diseases, or rather that ' the
stomach trouble was the cause of the heart
disturbances. I hit upon Stuart's Dyspepsia
( Tablets for a remedy and Invested a dollar and
a half for three boxes which lasted me three
months, and I can eat any kind of food I want
and have a good, .vigorous appetite. Although
I am\77 yearavold, I'now feel perfectly well
and : without being requested by any cne I
make this , statement as a compliment to th*
virtues of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for sale by
all druggists at 50c a box. -^ .

.'President Webb in . his- address called
attentioji to the completion of the Pa
cific cable and the -signing of the new
treaty, with China. Both events, he said,
would be of benefit to the country. In
connection with the Chinese situation, he
said that the attitude of the European
powers, Russia in particular, should be
at present a cause of much solicitude, and
he advised an emphatic expression of
views on this subject to the administra
tion. ; : ' V
The commercial situation, he thought,
was generally . disappointing, the political
uncertainty in Japan tending to make
merchants- and financial Interests cau
tious, while In China political confusion,
combined with the advance in silver, had
made mercantile ventures ; too much of a
lottery without , careful Investigation;
. The report of the secretary ,'John Foord,
also laid emphasis on - the Manchurlan
situation,*, he declaring that, In defiance
of. agreement, the. foreign administration
of the jjort of Newchwang, with all its
Injurious , consequences to ..American trade
and Cthe occupation by Russia of I the
eastern provinces, was still in force. \
."The nature of the demands formulated
as' conditions -precedent to* withdrawal,"
the' report | went on to say, "suggests that
they nave been purposely made Impossible
of, acceptance in order to justify a" con
tinued occupation." Foord continued: '
; The time has evidently come for the Govern
ment and people of the : United States to rec
ognize and accept I the full measure of ! their
responsibility in dealing with - this question.
.That the substitution of Russian for Chinese
sovereignty in Manchuria simply means the
beginning of the partition of the Chinese Em
pire does not admit of doubt; that the United
States has nothing to gain, but very much to
lose, from .. the division of China among- tha
great j powers of Europe needs no demonstra
tion. â¢ The question immediately before our
Government . is the preservation of an : opÂ«n
market . ,f or American Â¦ products Â¦ in Manchuria
and.it ha3 been Intimated that so long as our
commercial â¢â¢ rights there. . secured' by, ' treaty
with \ China, ' are ' respected by the power In
possession,, we can 1 have no ground < for ef
fective protest. But the Manchurian market,
existing or potential, important as it Is, must
be reckoned as constituting but a mere part of
the field for the sale of our products presented
by the Chinese Kmplre. : If tha future 1 of the
greater . market Â¦ depends absolutely,", as .your
committee. believes it does, on the .process of
dismemberment ; of ' that empire, being . peremp
torily â¢ arrested and Russia' belns^ compelled to
abide by the solemn stipulations on this point,'
which Â¦; she . has nowhere made so copiously as
in ; Washington; . then our. : Government < Is face
to face with a larger and graver question tha/i
that of 'the security of the open door for com
merce in" Manchuria. * " Â¦.

Carrie Sheuerman, a 13-year-old pupil
of Hugo Mansfeldt, performed on the
piano Wednesday evening in the Maple
room of the Palace Hotel lrv a manner
little short ot phenomenal.
The recital consisted of the most diffi
cult compositions of Grieg and Tschal
kowsky, twelve in all, five of which were
played for the first time In San Francisco
by any pianist, amateur or professional.
Little Miss Sheuerman has studied on
the piano for only four years, the first
two of which were spent under a' pupil
of Professor Mansfeldt and the last two
under Mansfeldt himself.
The first number was Grieg's "Die Prin
zessln," and it was in that number that
the child displayed . her wonderful tech
nique and expression. The terrific chords
and runs that would fairly stagger the
average pianist eeemed play to the girl,
which gazed calmly through the audience,
bowing to her friends. ..:.._. , .
The recital was an invitational affair
given by Professor. Mansfeldt and about
400 people were present. At the conclu
sion of the fourth number the girl was
literally stormed with flowers and con
gratulations. Last night was the first
time that Carrie Sheuerman ever played
before a large audience, but In this per
formance she has certainly done credit to
her instructor.

Mr. Brousseau was born in New Tork
in 1834 and had resided in California since
1877. Prior to locating in Los Angeles he
had been City Attorney of Saglnaw,
Mich., and also held various offices in
Chicago. In Los Angeles he formed a
law partnership with the late General "Vol
ney Howard and took high rank in his
profession. At one time he had. probably
as lucrative a practice as any lawyer in
Los Angeles County. He was president
of the Board of Education about fifteen
years ago and at one time received the
Democratic nomination for Superior
Judge, running far ahead of his ticket,
but failing of election, ..on, account of the
overwhelming normal Republican ma
jority., - . â¢'
No citizen of Los Angeles had a bet
ter reputation for integrity andgood citi
zenship than Brousseau. Both as a law
yer and a citizen he commanded the j re
spect of all who knew him, and he was
greatly loved by his friends and t Inti
mate associates. He was a member of
the Chamber of Commerce, the Masonic
fraternity 'and many: other organizations,

The second Cottlow concert was given
last evening, in Lyric Hall, with Miss
Cottlow as the sole attraction. The per
formance, like the first, was a complete
artistic triumph. The audience was ap
preciative, was held In the closest atten
tion and refused to -be satisfied at the
final number, the great . Schubert-Tausig
"Marche MUltalre," but "demanded as an
encore the "Waldesrauscnen," by Ll3zt.
The great versatility of Miss Cottlow is
shown in the variety of composers played.
From the -first Mozart "Rondo," a pure,
old melody, almost pastoral in simplicity,
through the "Thirty-two Variations" of
Beethoven in C minor, the "Paplllons" of
Schumann, three Chopin numbers, a Mac-
Dowell "Polonaise" and an "Idyl" and a
"Scherxo" by Samuel Bolllnger, to the
Schubert-Tausig "March Militalre" there
was a superb reading that was a Btudy
In tone production. WJth a touch like* a
breath or a bravura more- than dramatic,
the whole artistic gamut was played
upon. The staccato is delicate and the
legato at times seems welded into a solid
tonal mass. In the Beethoven "Varia
tions" there was a beautiful rendition of
the noble measures.
After the Chopin numbers for an encore
Miss Cottlow gave a Chopin "Nocturne"
In F major. The "Idyl" in C major and
"Scherzo" in B minor by Bolllnger, a
local composer, were very acceptable. The
"Scherzo" was bright and limpid and
showed continuity of style and musical
reason and was well received.
Miss Cottlow plays at the Unitarian
church in Oakland to-morrow night and
Saturday afternoon again in this ; city. At
the matinee she will be assisted by
Natorp Blumenfeld, violinist. The pro
gramme will be as follows:

The Minor ranch is situated near the
border of "Contra Costa County, fourteen
miles from Oakland. AH the machinery
of the company, including a huge derrick,
was destroyed by the flames. The dam
age will probably amount to several thou
sand dollars. Â¦
A concern known as the American Oil
and Refining . Company has been boring
for the fluid for the last four years and
the task was about to be given up as a
hopeless one. Â¦-Â¦ Last night, shortly after
7 o'clock, as the men were taking out the
drills preparatory to quitting their day's
toil, a stream of oil shot -up into the air.
The flow cams so suddenly that the
workers were astounded. They stood
staring at the amazing spectacle for sev
eral seconds. Before they realized "what
had happened a huge flame arose high
In the air and the oil that had started to
run along the ground also took fire.
The frightened workmen at once fled
from the spot and Just in time to es
cape an awful death or fearful injury.
The huge sheet of flame could plainly be
seen for miles and soon the spot where
the oil was struck became the gathering
place for scores of persons in the vldn
itv. .
Oil that has been sought for by an en
{erpr||ing company for years was dis
covered : . last night ' on the â¢ Minor, ranch,
in Contra Â£ Costa County,- and as
the murky fluid shot â¢' up Into the
air it suddenly became ignited. The col
umn of fire could be seen for miles 'and
presented ' a magnificent sight. Many
workmen In the vicinity had barely time
to escape with their lives and much ma
chinery was , entirely destroyed by the
flames. The oil became ignited by several
lanterns that hung on a derrick at the
side . of the well. '

SOFIA, Bulgaria, Oct IB. â The Bul
garian frontier , has again been crossed
by Turkish 1 troops, at Demlr-Kapu, near
Samakova. "The, Turks were pursuing a
band of insurgents and followed them
three miles into Bulgaria, A number of
shots were exchanged, but the Turkish
soldiers finally j retired without coming
into contact with Bulgarian troops. .
Such | incidents arouse less attention
now, owing to the absorbing interest
taken in the Bulgarian elections. .The
four "opposition 'parties have . fused
against the government, but the success
of the latter Is assured.
A large insurgent r band waa dispersed
on October 13 near Marhovu, after eight
hours' skirmishing.: The Turks lost sixty
killed and wounded, while the losses of
the insurgents reached two hundred.,

So humiliated were the members that
every effort was put forward to smooth
over the matter and efforts were made
to deny that the presence of a policeman
on the threshold cf the lodgeroom was
necessary. Brother Andrew Johnston
even declared that the policeman , had
been called by error, though he admitted
that there had been a keen difference be
tween himself and Brother William Crow
hurst as to the lattcr's intention to show
his etereosticon views, as had been ar
ranged by the subcommittee appointed
for the purpose of creating the amuse
ment for the Juvenile Band of llope.
The Grand Lodge in session passed a
resolution on the matter which con
cluded with the following:
"If any individuals debated their dif
ference of opinion while the Grand Lodge
was not in session It cannot be charged
to the body itself."
The unpleasant 'proceedings which oc
curred during the interval of the session
the previous evening between Brother
Johnston and Brother Crowhurst caused
a feeling of regret that the sedate delib
erations of several days should have been
marred by anything that Favored of ill
will or Intemperate argument or oppo
sition.

Job says it is not the desire of the
members of the Chicago Employers' As
sociation to use the statistics for the pur
pose of saying to the employes, "This

CHICAGO, Oct. 15.â Statistics covering
the cost of living of workingmen in Chi
cago for a period of five years, extending
from 1898 to 1903, were made public to-day
by Secretary F. W. Job of the Chicago
Employers' Association. They are de
signed to' show that the assertions of the
labor organization that the cost of living
has advanced from 25 to 40 per cent in
the given period are not based on facts.
According to the figures submitted by
Secretary Job, the average increase in
the cost of living in Chicago for five
years is 11.3 per cent.
In Chicago It Averaged 11.3 Per

BUFFALO, Oct. 15.â Seven trainloads of
John Alexander Dowie's restoration host,
bound for New York, arrived here to-day
and after spending a few hours at Niagara
Falls resumed their pilgrimage to New
York. Six of the trains carried 2000 Zion
ists and the seventh was the prophet's
special train. Each of the six trains was
in charge of forty Zionist City Guards. It
had been announced that Dowle would
hold a meeting in Prospect Park upon his
arrival at the Falls. Several local preach
ers called upon Assistant Superintendent
Perry and lodged a protest against the
use of the public park for missionary
work by the Zionists. When Dowie's lieu
tenants asked for permission to erect a
stand their request was refused. Dowie
when informed sent them back with a
message for the assistant superintendent
stating that he had no intention to vio
late the law, and that he merely wished
to hold a short song and prayer service
in the park and, incidentally, have the
meeting photographed. Superintendent
Perry granted the permit to that extent.

NAPA, Oct. 15.â Louis Wende, a young
man employed at the California market,
on Main street, met with a painful acci
dent to-day. He was feeding meat Into a
sausage machine which is run by an elec
tric motor, and squeezed it down Into the
hopper with his hand instead of the in
strument used for that purpose. The re
volving steel suddenly caught the fingers
and mangled them in a fearful manner.
He was hastily taken to a physician's
office, where an operation was performed.
Three fingers were amputated.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 15.â City Jailer W. H.
Brnv.-n was this evening dismissed from
â¢jfiW by the Police and Fire Commission.
No rea.son was given for the dismissal.
IJÂ«--rman Walthers was elected to fill the
vicancy.
Brown held the position of jailer for
about three years. He is a member of
th*> Grand Army, and it was through this
influence he was given the position by the
Martin administration. A short time ago
Brown locked uo an influential young
man for riding on the sidewalk, and
friends of the latter complained to the
Police Commissioners, claiming the man
was given no chance to secure bail. This
is believed to be the cause of the dis
missal.

Recent Arrest of a Young Man
Thought to Have Caused
Dismissal.
The count in the indictment charging
the carrying of concoa'ed weapons was
ignored during the trial and the jury took
no action on it.
After the verdict was announced the
cierk held up the pistols which had fig
ured in the trial and offered them to the
defendant, who waved them off, saying:
"They are not mine."
Tillman left the courtroom in company
with his attorneys, but parted with them
at the front door to go across the street
to the jail, visiting that institution for
the last timg/io gather up his effects. He
had been in custody since January 15,
his application for bail having been re
fused.
Mrs. Tillman and the defendant's moth
er were r.ot In the courtroom when the
verdict was announced, but the former
had been apprised of an agreement and
was at the Jail to await the announce
ment and to meet her husband there. The
mother had heard at her hotel, a few
blocks away, that the jury had come in
and was hastening on her way to the
courthouse when she met her son coming
out on the street. Learning the result,
she threw her arms around his neck.
Tillman left on an afternoon train for
his home in Edgefield, accompanied by his
wife and friends from his home county.
Senator Tillman was not present to-day,
having gene yesterday to his home
at Trenton, where his wife is recovering
from injuries received in a runaway ac
cident.
I did ask for a change of venue because I
was convinced on account of prejudice in
Richland County that I could not get a fair
and Impartial trial In that county. I felt
eure that as soon as my case could be pre
5*-ritfd ti an impartial jury 1 would be vindi
cated. The result has Justified the correct
ness of my judgment.
I feel very gratpful at the result of the ver
dict, but at no time did I apprehend any
strious consequences. I, of course, deeply re
gret the death of Mr. Gonsales. but I was
forced to do what 1 did. I have never appre
h-nded a conviction, for I fe!t that I had not
done any more than any other man would
have done under the same circumstances and
what I was comj'flkd to do. My position was
fully stated !n the testimony 1 gave on the
etand.
A demonstration followed the announce
ment, friends of the defendant giving
vent to their feelings in' a shout. The
court previous to the reading of the ver
dict had admonished the spectators to re
frain from any demonstration.
Counsel for the defense moved the de
fendant's discharge from the Sheriff's
custody. No objection being made by the
State, the court made the order.
Soon after the jury retired yesterday a
ballot was taken, the result being 10 to
2 for acquittal. After some deliberation
one of the two went over to the side of
acquittal, but it was not until about twen
ty minutes before the jury sent word to
the court to-day that an agreement had
been reached that the twelfth man yield
ed. The long delay caused a general im
pression that another trial would result.
The jury could not have stayed out be
>ond Saturday night.
Tiliman, after his acquittal, made the
following statement to the press:
lumbia on January 14 last, was
acquitted this morning. The jury was out
twenty hours before reaching a verdict.

Zimmerman, Rosenblatt and Schafer
were found guilty "of acts detrimental to
the interests and welfare of the exchar.se
and of conduct and proceedings incon
sistent with just and equitable principles
of trade in closing certain contracts in
United Railroads of San Francisco bonds,
"if, when and as issued.' " The complain
ant was E. B. C. Randolph.
Zimmerman & Forshay made the fol
lowing statement:
There is a difference of opinion between us
and certain parties with wham we had con
tracts for delivery to us of San Francisco
street railway bond*. These differences are the
subject of lawsuItB which the courts will have
to decide. The governors of the Stock Ex
<han(rÂ«, on complaint of the eame parties with
whom we ar*. in litigation, took action ad
versely to us. Ar.d as thÂ»>re Is no appeal from
the action of the governor?, the final deter
mination of the controversy will have to be de
cided between the parties by the courts In
which litigation* are now pending.
Entire responsibility for the firm's deal
ings in the United Railroads bonds is as
sumed by Zimmerman. Rosenblatt and
Schafer are suspended with Zimmerman
because they are board members of the
Fame firm.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â Threa members
of the firm of Zimmerman & Forshay
wore to-day suspended from the Stock
Exchange privileges. This action was
taken as a result of an investigation of
certain transactions by the firm in San

Zimmerman was suspended lor onÂ© year
and S!gmund H. Rosenblatt and Leonard
Schafer were suspended for ninety days
rcch. These men were the board mem
bers of the firm.
With the progress of trades unions and their
growth in Btrenxth there will probably be a
lessening in the intensity against the non
unionists, but no lessening in the policy of
exclusion.
John M. Stahl. secretary of the Farm
ers' National Congress, spoke on "The
Publicâ By a Farmer." He said:
It may provoke in some quarters the smile
of derision to suggest the ethical flement in
the relations of < mployer and employed, but
that element mcxt have common recognition
In any ccn.slrirmtion of the matter that will
prove of much profit. Any permanent, peace
ful and satisfactory adjustment, though al
most certain!"- it will not be In thfe name,
must be in the spirit of Jesus Christ. They
that find the true solutions of the problems
that confront this conference must be touched
by the spirit of the Carpentrr of Galilee â the
greatest teacher In all the ages â for the
brotherhood of man end labor and capital can
be broucht into their normal, harmonious re
lation only on the basis of law. Justice and
the golden rule.
President Mitchell in opposing the "open
shop" said in part:
The majority of non-unionists are not ma
liciousâonly at the worst stupid and apathetic.
However, there Is one croup of non-unionists â
the pn.forslciial strikebreakers â but little ir
ir.ove<l from the criminal class. : Some, of these
professional str'kebreakers are former union
ists â men who have been dishonorably dis
charged from the union, cashiered for conduct
unbecoming to a unionist, if not actually in
dicted for defalcations or for other offenses
against the laws. OtherR have not been in a
union and have not benefited by actual work.
Thomas F. Woodlock of New York in
an address to the conference referred to
the financial situation and declared that
the indications were strong in the direc
tion of a reaction in general business,
which, while it would not be prolonged or
serious, should nevertheless be taken into
consideration by- the associated labor
leaders as a reason for great conserva
tism in their dealings with employers.
MUST FOLLOW GOLDEN KULE.
Orgranizfd labor an<! organized capital are in
a formative state. They are both new to their
acquired power. With time and experience a
reaction in favor oX conservatism will make
itself felt, and in the meantime conciliation
will h<?ln rather than hinder a more reliable
ami permanent remr-dy.
Henry White, secretary of the United
Garment Workers, spoke of "The Solu
tion of Industrial Pro-blems Through As
sociated Action." lie paid in part:
There muet be something mo/e than might â
a. sons- Of fair dfalins and mutual forbear
ance â if better relations are to be maintained.
Only as people refrain from taking full ad
vantage of all their opportunities, as in the
Â«/a*e of a, family or in our dealings with
friends, will we get nearer a solution ar.i! ap
proach rral peace.
The Kreat hope of our Industrial future is
that the working: classes, whose powers for
Stood and evil have been so strencthened by
organization, will be KuiJed by enlightened
principles, and abstain from seeking proximate
benefits in conlniventl&n of undoubted eco
nomic exuerlenccs nnd at the cost of funda
mental rights. To the extent they misuse their
great power of arbitrarily curtailing the rights
of ihelr fellow laborers or their employers
they array themselves asfain?t public senti
ment, and from that day their power and their
usefulness will decline. Even if labor organi
zations comprised the entire number of wage
workurs in the country, this would give them
no rizht either to override the personal lib
erty of those within or beyond their ranks or
to insist upon special privileges or immuni
ties.
Howard W. Taylor, City Prosecuting
Attorney, welcomed the visiting delegates
on behalf of Chicago, Mayor Harrison
being unable to be present.
HOPE OF INDUSTRIAL FTJTUBE.
Oscar S. Strauss presided and spoke on
"How to Establish Better Relations Be
tween Employers and Employes," advo
cating conservatism in dealing with labor
troubles. He said in part:
Judge Waterman made a brief address,
stating the purpose of the conference and
asserting that no industrial progress was
possible except under the reign of peace
which the conference is endeavoring to
bring about.
CHICAGO, Oct. 15.â Discussion of the
question of the "open shop" by repre
sentatives of labor and of capital took up
the greater part of the first session to
day of the National Civic Federation con
ference, which is endeavoring to establish
more rightful relations between employ
ers and employes and put an end to strife.
During his talk on the "open shop" to
day John Mitchell, president of the United
Mine Workers of America, strongly de
nounced the non-unionist and the strike
breaker, whom he likened to a criminal.
At to-morrow's session Samuel Gom

PLASTER OF PARISâ Bergina. City.
Plaster of Paris was so named because
immense beds of the material were found
in the immediate vicinity of Paris,
France, and because it was in that city
that it was first extensively used sa a
plaster or cement. The material is pul
verized rock, which Is heated until It loses
one-fifth of its weight by the expulsion of
moisture from its composition. When
mixed with water the anhydrous gypsum
again chemically combines with it and
passes into a solid state.

WHITE HOUSEâ I. G. N., City. Visit
ors having business with the President of
the United States are received at the
White House, Washington, D. C, between

far as public business will permit.
"Think of it. Our farms produce $4,000,000,000; our
shops and factories produce more than all the shops
and factories of any other two countries on the map
by $3,000,000,000 per annum. The productive
capacity, without duplications, amounts to $11,000,
000.000, out of which we export in round numbers
$1,500,000,000 and import $1,000,000,000. We there
fore consume practically 95 per cent of all we pro
duce. Suppose we open the doors and allow Europe
to clothe us and furnish us our manufactured prod
ucts, who will consume the products of our farms,
and what shall we do with the products of our fac
tories? ;â¢*â¢:;:
"No. we will take reasonable care of our own.
encouraging those who can afford it to buy some of
their luxuries abroad, and from the importation of
luxuries â laces, jewelry and fancy fabrics â we will
collect a q;ood portion of our revcunes and we will
sell our surplus in foreign countries."
Observe the distinction, the proper and absolute
distinction, made between free imports and free
trade. Since the surrender of Peel England has had
free imports, but her foreign trade has never been
free: therefore it is an cr/or to call her system free
trade. The two systems of free imports and pro
tected domestic industries have never been as clearly
stated as by Secretary Shaw, and he' has put the
country under renewed obligations by his forcible
exposition
EARLY in 1896, when the free silver craze had
t-et the Democracy to tongue-chewing and the
epidemic had attacked large sections of the
Ktpub'.ican party, the first strong voice raised in the
Central West for sound money was that of
Governor Shaw of Iowa. The courage of the
net may be judged when it is known that
ihe mere politicians in his party in that State were
quite generally of the belief that free silver was a
winning issue and that the Republican party must cut
in and take it first. His speech was one of the mem
orable events of that fateful year. It smote his
i<arty upon its sleeping conscience and roused it to
battle for the right. Since then his strength has
been reccgr.ized, and by putting him at the head of
;he treasury President Roosevelt proved his excellent
judgment of men.
He opened the Ohio campaign at Akron on the
10th inst. As his speech was not used by the Asso
ciated Press, we put before our readers that part of
it which defines the protective system and considers
the means of getting and holding external trade.
We wish to impress upon our readers that they
should preserve this speech and its definitions. If
they oppose protection, let them study what the Sec
rttary of the Treasury says and see if they can answer
it. If they cannot, let them consider the wisdom of
admitting it and joining theirs to the strength of the
party which upholds the-policy, which the Secretary
so plainly states in these words:
"One of the most important problems before the
American people is that of markets. In this all par
ties agree. But while the parties agree on the im
porUnce of the ultimate fact, they do not agree
upon the methods to be pursued in the accomplish
ment of the desired end. The plan proposed by the
minority fiarty is to throw our commercial doors
wide open for the free importation of products of
foreign labor. Members of that party insist that if
we <lo this we will of necessity have unrestricted ac
cess to the markets of other countries. They urge
that if we will but allow Europe to clothe us, furnish
its our glass, our earthenware, our hardware, our
steel rails, our structural iron, and everything else
;vc produce, we will thus secure a most wonderful
export trade.
"They insist that the way for us to capture the
r:arkets of the world is to throw our mar
kets open to the world. The logic of this
opinion 'is, if we give away what we have
we will then have an abundance. England
has had free goods for half a century, but she has
never had free" trade. She has run against the tariff
at the entrance of every country she has attempted
to invade, and now her .colonies, having become vig
orous, arc begging to impose duties upon her
products, and Mr. Chamberlain resigns his position
:n the Cabinet, and at the time of life when most
men are about to retire to the quiet of their homes
goes out to make the fight of his life in behalf of
protection. There is a great difference between free
goods from foreign countries and free trade in for
eign countries.
GUARDIANâ E., City. When a court

Applications were read from W. C. Gur
ney, who desires to establish a first clasÂ«
bakery in the valley, and F. Robinson to

It was suggested that a telephone ser
vice be installed which will connect the
various hotel3 and camps in the valley,
and a committee was appointed to ascer
tain the cost of a double wire and set of
telephone boxes.
The grading of the roads was the next
matter taken up and it was moved and
seconded that a road grading machine he
bought immediately and started working.
Reports on the condition of the Â¦water

the purpose of deciding several questions
which were carried over from the last

A lease of the Sentinel Hotel was grant
ed to J. B. Cook for four years, to com
mence November 1, 1903.
At the last meeting of the Commission
ers, David A. Curry, proprietor of Camp
Curry, made application for the prlvlleg*
of selling lemonade, cigars and candy in
the camp, but Nelson Salter. who runs a
large store in the valley, objected, say
ing the new stand would injure his busi
ness. The matter was taken up yester
day and the license will be granted Curry,
providing he sells his. goods only to thoso
living in his camp, which is more than
a mile from Salter's store.

PERSONAL MENTION.
HOMESEEKERS L., Sierra Valley,
Cal. For information as to lands open for
settlers in the Hawaiian Islands and the
Philippines address a letter of inquiry to
the General Land Office, Washing
ton, D. C.
SOME years ago there was quite a lively discus
sion going on all over the country as to what
we should do with our ex-Presidents. It was
one of the topics of the period of the year known as
the "silly season" and speedily ran its course, being
forgotten as soon as a subject of genuine interest
arose to engage public attention. We refer to it now
only to point out how well the only ex-President liv
ing has solved the question for us. Mr. Cleveland
out of office has been devoting his time to fishing
and to political philosophy, and in each line of endea
vor has attained an eminence which all of his coun
trymen recognize and respect.
In the field of political philosophy the chief theme
of the retired Democratic sage is that 'of the duty of
the American citizen to take part in public affairs
and to actively engage in politics. Whatever be the
occasion upon which he is called upon to address
any considerable audience he sooner or later directs
his argument and his appeal to that end. Thus, for
example, in a recent address on the subject of "Uni
versity Education" he said: "I cannot rid myself at
this moment of the thought that education is a self
ish, useless thing if it is to be hid in a napkin, or if
it is to be hugged to the breast by its possessor as a
mere individual prize, and it seems to me that the
existence of schools and colleges in this land of purs
can scarcely be deemed important except as they
are the sources from which education may be dis
tributed through many channels for the enrichment of
the body politic and the stimulation of patriotic
thoughtfulness among our people."
His most notable utterance on this subject, how
ever, is his latest," that delivered before the Commer
cial Club of Chicago on Wednesday evening'. This
address is one which Cleveland must have carefully
studied, for he cannot have been unaware of the fact
that as soon as it was known he had accepted an in
vitation to the banquet of the club the rumor ran
round the country that the occasion would be used as
an opportunity to launch a boom for him as a can
didate for the Presidency. * It was even asserted that
his words would reveal a willingness to accept the
leadership of his party. Under such ?circumstances
the speech was awaited with eagerness, and we may
be sure it was prepared with a full understanding of
the care with which it would be scrutinized by poli
ticians of all sorts.
There is nothing in the speech to help the Cleve
land boom. His speech to his fellow fishermen of
Buzzards Bay on the occasion of the recent clam
bake had more of party politics than this thought
ful address on "American Good Citizenship." From
first to last it was a plea for the faithful performance
of political duty. After pointing out that some per
sons neglect public duties because of indifference,
others because of an unreasoning optimism that
everything will turn out all right anyhow, and still
others because of their complete absorption in pur
suit of private gain or private pleasure, Mr. Cleve
land said:
"The withdrawal of wholesome sentiment and
patriotic activity from political action on the part of
those who are indifferent to their duty, or foolhardy
in their optimism, opens the way for a ruthless and
unrelenting enemy of our free institutions. The
abandonment of our country's watch towers by
those who should be on guard and the slumber of
the sentinels who should never sleep directly invite
the stealthy approach and the pillage and loot of the
forces of selfishness and greed. These baleful ene
mies of patriotic effort will lurk everywhere as long
as human nature remains unregenerate, but nowhere
in the world can they create such desolations as in
free America, and nowhere can they so cruelly de
ftroy man's highest and best aspirations for self
government. It is useless for us to blink the fact that
our scheme of government is based upon a close
interdependence of interest and purpose among
those who make up the body cf our people. Let us
be honest with ourselves."
The address, which was published in full in The
Call of yesterday, comes pertinent and pat to the
people of San Francisco at this time. There is now
an urgent need for good citizens to take part in the
campaign and save the city from the menace of
class divisions and factional city government. In
this emergency it is the duty of every American to
vote, and to vote right.

RUTLAND, Vt., Oct. 15.â News of the re
moval from office of United States Mar
shal Alfred A. Field by President Roose
velt to-day surprised the residents of this
city, where Field is ranked as a leading
and highly respected citizen. He was ap
pointed Marshal by President McKlnley
and reappointed a year ago by President
Roosevelt. k
Before leaving them the Mar5haS in
formed his son that two men on the boat
who. he claims, had been pointed out to
him as proper persons but whom he had
never seen before, might assist him if
necessary and that he might leave the
prisoners in their charge while he went
to sup:>er. The deputy did so ami upon
his return from supper found that the
two men and the three prisoners had es
caped. The Marshal cl.ilmed that these
two men had bt-en pointed out by the
agent of the railroad company with whom
the Government had arranged for their
trip across the continent. The agent pos
itively denied this statement and, with
out passing on the question of veracity
raised by this denial, the Attorney Gen
eral was of the opinion that upon the
Marshals own story he was guilty of
such culpable negligence as to call for hia
immediate removal in the interest of the
service.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 13.â The President.
upon the recommendation of the Attor
ney General, has removed United States
Marshal Alfred A. Field of the District
of Vermont for dereliction of duty in per
mitting the escape at Providence. R. I.,
of three Chinese entrusted to him for de
portation.
The prisoners who escaped, with eleven
others, were under sentence- of deporta
tion and were conducted to Providence.
R. I., on the evening of June 20 and placed
on board a steamer at that point som?
time prior to 5 o'clock. At 5:30 o'clock the-
Marshal left the boat and returned tu
Boston, leaving the prisoners in charge of
his son, who was acting as his deputy to
accompany the prisoners t'Â» San, Fran
cisco.
Â¦p""iR0M the Democratic and Labor party corners
I""* of the political triangle come the egophilian
*Â¦ feature and issue of the city campaign. Mayor
Schmitz, after self-examination, announced himself as
"tried and true," and began calling his opponents
anything but that. Then Mr. Lane raised his voice
to oratorical pitch and announced his own discovery
of his resemblance to the Savior and his desire to
make of San Francisco a New Jerusalem. In pic
turesque metaphor he called the city a temple and
his opponents "money changers," to be thonged out
into the cold by his avenging political right arm.
These prognathous and bulbous-headed features of
the campaign of course have no right relation to its
true meaning. It may be defined as an effort of the
citizens of San Francisco to secure an upright and
businesslike administration of the city, and such ex
penditure of the money recently voted for improve
ment as will return to the people for every dollar
they pay a hundred cents' worth of benefit.
Mr. Lane's evening organ, once suspected of leas
ing its fugues and doing political oratorio for hire,
discarded things on the labor corner by charging
Schmitz with incurring the juvenile enmity of the
city, to which he responded with asperity. Then it
turned an offensive tune upon Mr. Crocker, giving
him demerit marks in regard to his reformation of
the vintage interest of the State. Mr. Crocker does
not have to pay any attention to this and other un
pleasant music, for whenever such airs are played on
the organ others, like Mr. Sbarboro and the grape
planters, rise, and vindicate him in such plain state
ment that the Republican Committee really owes the
organ something for giving them the chance.
As Mr. Crocker's campaign is addressed to the
business sense and local patriotism of San Fran
cisco, he docs not have to indulge in personalities.
So that sort of campaigning is left to Lane and
Schmitz. and they make it really interesting. Mr.
Lane, in a moment of paternal pride, took the public
into his domestic confidence by introducing his
bright and interesting boy into the fight as a native
son. With a husky "ha! ha!!" Mayor Schmitz coun
tered on Lane's single native son with three of his
own. This agitated the Democratic corner of the
triangle. It seemed to Lane a blow below the belt,
since it suggested a disadvantage that he cannot re
pair in the brief period of the campaign. But he re
covered his vocabulary and proceeded to introduce
the Trojan horse into the fight, and that celebrated
charger is now prancing through the field, wooden
head and tail up, scenting the battle at short range,
filled with something which Lane hints is detrimental
to the city. Probably it's'bots. The followers of
Mayor Schmitz resented this horse on their candi
date by burning red pepper in Lane's next meeting,
and his followers and admirers sneezed at his impas
sioned periods and had to cough up their applause.
It will be seen at a glance that these things indi
cate the pungency of the anti-Republican campaign.
To step from boasts of paternal qualifications to
p*pper is next thing to a breach of the peace. Let
us hope that the rapid progress from the census to
capsicum may not indicate a physical collision be
tween the two champions of personality. At present
Mr. Lane stands in the attitude of crying from the
housetops, "Schmitz threw red pepper at me, there
fore I am the only man who should be Mayor."
And from Schmitz' corner comes the answering slo
gan, "He called me a wooden horse, therefore I am
the only tried and true."
These be the diversions of the campaign, but while
Lane oscillates between Homer and the Scriptures,
the siege of Troy and Solomon's temple, and Schmitz
spits on the keys of his oratorical fiddle and screws
up the strings to make strident answer to the dia
pasons of Lane's evening organ, and the people are
amused, the campaign of Mr. Crocker proceeds on
the lines of present reason and future righteousness
toward the judgment to come on both of his un
ruly antagonists.

family of boys, all given to the gun habit, by repeat
ing these incidents they can leave the old folks *well
fixed. It must be noticed that even if Governor Ter
rill pardon the boy, or commute his sentence to im
prisonment, still the great State-of Georgia must
keep faith with old Mr. Caruthers and pay him the
$150 due for bringing the lad in.
No report of the boy's opinion of the affair comes
to hand. Judging the family by the old- man, it is.
probable that he too much enjoys the process '. of
being fed and fattened for the hangman to have any
opinion beyond his victuals. The neighbors are
silent, too. None of them rushes into print to tell
how much they enjoy the society of the elder
Caruthers. He may be an object of envy as he
comes in triumph jingling in his pocket the price of
his son's life. Prophets foretold that this century
would be remarkable. They are right, and so far its
most remarkable product is the Caruthers family of
Wilcox County, Georgia.
SOME MORE ISSUES.
THE SAN FEAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1903.
A Western boy bandit is no longer the dream of
the wild-eyed youngsters of the kindergarten, but a
very . disagreeable reality recently captured in Ore
gon. He is a trifle too big~ to spank, too young to
be punished as a criminal, and altogether useless and
unnecessary in the general scheme of things
The unknown demons that are using dynamite with
which to wreck railroad trains in the Middle West
belong to that dread pest which has grown out of
twentieth century deviltry in absolutely motiveless
malignity. For such fiends American legislators
have not yet invented a punishment severe enough,
for death 15 mercy to those that conspire without
motive or sense of injury against mankind.
At a recent address, delivered to the students of
the Chico High School Governor Pardee urged his
youthful hearers never to burn the midnight oil at
the expense of health. Is this an assault upon Cupid
or Minerva, or has our estimable chief executive in
mind the fact that the sturdy students of Chico will
soon be voters and will remember him who tried to
make easy their days of studentship?
It is said that Governor Terrill is bothered about
the matter. One thing is sure, however â the reward
should be paid to the father. When it was offered a
contract was entered into by the State, and the old
man was not excluded from its benefits. If he think
the best use for his boy is to hang him and thereby
make him contribute to the family fortunes, the State
cannot discriminate against him. If he have a large
IN Wilcox County, Georgia, has appeared a modern
Roman, with variations. His name is Caruthers.
His son carried a gun and had occasion to use
it, with results fatal to a fellow citizen. That is not
an unusual circumstance in that part of the country.
It was perhaps unusual, however, that the' junior
Caruthers was convicted by a jury for his skill as a
marksman and was sentenced to die on the gallows
tree. As that sort of exit was distasteful to him,
he bVoke jail, went into hiding and became a fugitive
from justice. Then the public authorities proceeded
to appraise the value of his victim at $150 by offering
that sum to any one who would bring the culprit
in to be hanged.
To long distance observers it looks hardly worth
while to hang any one for whom so small a reward
is offered. If the man who was shot was worth so
little, why add it to the cost of hanging the shooter?
But small as the amount was it brought the fugitive
back to jail. It may not be considered <remarkable
that some one was found willing to turn an honest
penny by giving the hangman a job. But it is re
markable that the fugitive was given up by his own
father. If the affair stopped there the world might
turn it into an heroic incident, and the father would
figure as putting the laws of his country above his
natural affection for his son, and higher even to the
family aversion for having one of its members
hanged. But old Mr; Caruthers does not leave room
for such heroic ascription. He delivered his sot$ to
the hangman, claimed the reward of $150 and hastened
to explain that the boy was a fugitive and likely to
starve to death, and that it was better to be hanged
with a full belly and let the family make a little
something.
To carry out this remarkable thrift the public
authorities ought to raise the amount of the award
by charging gate money to see the boy hanged, and
making the father gatekeeper to collect the receipts.
This would save the taxpayers and would make the
young man do something for the family in his last
moments.

Official Kansas is investigating, but meantime the women of
an entire State are seeing to it that their triumph of the last few
weeks is maintained and the cause of true love holds full sway.
They fought in a way peculiarly feminine for their right to receive
their lovers and to be wooed and won and married when, where and how
they pleased. The men fought against it, but the women won. and in
pursuance of that victory they dragged the defeated candidates out of
office by main force. Hence official Kansas' perturbation. Hence,
too, official Kansas' effort to keep the facts quiet until it gets full

And did you ever read of Delaroo? He was an Indian. He was
more. He was the shadow incarnate of Maje Sampson. He was even
more than that. He was the best railroad character that ever caught
the facile pen of Frank H. Spearman, who is himself the best writer of
American railroad stories in the world to-day. This is Delaroo as
Spearman knew him:
"As long as Maie would talk Delaroo would listen. That single
word was, in fact, the key to Delaroo; Delaroo was a listener: for that
reason nobody knew much about him."
And this in brief is one of the most tense moments in all Soear-

"What do I think of it?" muttered Neighbor, when the local operator
asked him for a report for Callahan. "I think there's two engines for

about a million sheen to pay for â " Neighbor paused to give an order
and survey the frightful scene.

If you have been reading Spearman's new series of two-page stories
you will not need even these extracts to keep you on a sharo lookout for
Delaroo in the next Sunday Call. Spearman's stories are the sort that
you never forget. They get a grip on your memory like the mysterious
fascination of railroading itself.
IJowever, Delaroo is onlv one of the big things in the next Sunday

âmore mysterious even than "The Mystery Box." more exciting than
"Tainted Gold." more surprising by hr than "Brewster's Millions." and

One of the most worthless characters
ever caught in the police dragnet was
taken Into custody yesterday on a war
rant charging cruelty to a minor.
"Eric Harvey Leroy" is the name of the
creature against whom the complaint was
sworn by Miss Mabel Turner of 204^ Eddy
street. Miss Turner, who resides with her
mother at the above address, complained
that Leroy had been. In the habit of beat
ing four minoV children of Mrs. II. Brown,
who resided in the rear of 204& Eddy
street.
LEEOY SHIRKS WORK.
On Wednesday last Leroy took one of
the children, Elmer Brown, a pretty boy
of 7 years, and held him out of a two
story window by his cars, telling the
child that he would do the same thing
again "to make him say his prayers."
A warrant was issued by Judge Mogan
and ball was fixed at 1500, and the war
rant was given to Officer McMurray of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children. McMurray and Officer Cul
hnane made a search of the tenderloin
for Leroy yesterday afternoon and finally
caught him in the house occupied by
Mrs. Brown In the rear of 204& Eddy
street.
The statements made by Leroy to the
officers show that he is a despicable crea
ture, shirking honest work and being
supported by the earnings of two hard
working women.
Leroy admitted that he' had held Elmer
Erown out of the two-story window, but
said "he was doing it for fun." He also
admitted that he had struck the children
of Mrs. Brown, but that "he never hurt
them."
According to the evidence collected by
the officers of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children Mrs. Brown
has not given proper care and attention
to her four children. The eldest girl,
Sarah, aged 15 years, is supposed to have
run away two weeks ago on account of
the cruel treatment of Leroy. Mrs. Brown
told a conflicting story to the one given
by Leroy concerning the girl.
Leroy admitted that the girl Sarah
might have run away on account of his
striking her, but Mrs. Browrv'clalmed that
the girl was visiting friends in Oakland.
She could not remember the name of the
family and did not know their address.
The childrenâ Mary, 10 years old, and
Elmer, 7 yearsâ were questioned by the of
ficers, but It was evident that they had
been carefully coached not to answer
questions. They said that Leroy was their
"uncle." The fellow himself claimed that
he .was no relative of Mrs. Brown, and
the woman later on said that Leroy was
her "brother-in-law."
EAKN*> $50 IN A YEAB.
Mrs. Brown says that her husband went
to Alaska six years ago and that she has
not heard from him since. She denied
that Leroy had treated her children cruel
ly, but said that "he might have slapped
them."
Leroy was questioned by the arresting
officers before Mrs. Brown returned to
the rooms she occupied. Leroy stated that
he took many of his meals with Mrs.
Brown and that he roomed in the 'house
five nights a week. When he was asked
where he roomed the balance of the week
he replied that he had a wife living at
501 Post street, but that though he was
separated from her she gave him money
out of her earnings.
He further admitted that he had not
worked steadily for a lono: time, and that
he had not earned 550 since the first of
the year. When he was asked why he.
did not work and why he was rooming
at Mrs. Brown's house he replied that he
had been drinking: heavily for a long
time.
The officers who heard his statements
decided to put a further charge of va
grancy against him and to ask the courts
to give him the full penalty allowed by
law.
It was learned at 501 Post street that
Leroy is known there, but that he never
had a room there.
USED INSULTING LANGUAGE.
Miss Mabel Turner, who swore to the
complaint against Leroy, stated yester
day that Mrs. Brown's children had been
beaten constantly by the fellow. She
said that both *her mother and herself
Insolvent Housewife.
Mrs. Thomas Davis of Los Gatos filed a
petition in Insolvency yesterday In the
United States District Court. She owes
$1347 and has no assets.
Jacob Silverman, Alias Morris Beck
er, Held to Answer Before
Superior Court.
Jacob Silverman, alias Morris Becker,
was held to answer before the Super'or
Court by Police Judge Mogan yesterday
on a charge of robbery in $5000 bonds. He
is only 20 years of age p.nd has well-to
do relatives in Seattle.
On the night of October 8 W. H. Eggles
ton, a miner, was in the dance hall at 519
Pacific street, and during the even
ing went to a room In the rear.
Silverman followed him and, placing
the muzzle of a revolver against
Egglesto.n's abdomen, ordered him
to throw up his ' hands. Eggleston
obeyed, but one of his arms dropped and
Silverman, shoving the muzzle of the
revolver into his mouth, said, "Nope of
that, now: throw up. your hands or I'll
blow your head off."
Eggleston was relieved of his watch and
chain and Silverman ran out of the dance
hall. Eggleston gave the alarm and Po
liceman Robl. who happened to be in the
neighborhood, chased and captured Sil
verman, who had the stolen watch and
chain in his possession.
had warned Leroy as to his conduct and
he made insulting replies.
Charles Brown, the 13-year-old son of
Mrs. Brown, was arrested a few days
ago on a charge of petty larceny. With
another boy he broke into, a cigar store
and /stole some money from a till. The
case is now before the Juvenile Court.
"This man," said Miss Turner, "is a
worthless character. He has hung around
Mrs. Brown's rooms morning, noon and
night and does not work. He has beaten
her children constantly and it finally be
came so bad that I was forced to make
a complaint against him to the police and
swear to a warrant. When he held ffie
little boy out of the second-story window
we thought he would drop the child and
kill it."
Leroy claims that he formerly worked
as a window cleaner and that he had
studied medicine. Mrs. Brown said that
she had known Leroy for some years and
that he had studied medicine for two
years at the Cooper College. Investiga
tion proved both statements to be false.
CHILDREN ARE COACHED.
That the children of Mrs. Brown had
been carefully coached not to speak to
strangers was evident 6y their attitude
yesterday when Leroy was arrested. The
girl, Mary, warned Leroy not "to talk
so much" while he was being questioned
by the officers, and little Elmer said that
"uncle only held me out of the window
in fun."
The neighbors of the Brown family
stated yesterday that the girl Mary was
obliged to do the cooking and washing
for the entire family ami that they were
only sent to school In the last few days,
after complaints had been made to the
mother.
Mrs. Brown works as a janitress and
when the officers went to her rooms yes
terday, the girl Mary was preparing din
ner while the little boy of 7 years was
chopping wood for the stove.
When the officers of the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Children in
formed Mrs. Brown that they would take
the children from her she made a scene
by declaring she would not be separated
from them. She begged the officers to
let her keep the children and said she
would look after them and not allow Le
roy to come to her house again.
Leroy was taken to the City Prison last
night in default of $500 bail.
'"Death from chronic morphinism and
chloral poisoning" was the verdict ren
dered yesterday by the Coroner's jury
in the inquest upon the body of Abraham
H." Kohn. who died on October 9 in Aaron
Adler's sanatorium at 1444 Green street.
Kohn was the young Chicago millicnaire
who came to this city with "Dot" Thur
man, alia? Miss Webb, and who repre
sented herself to be his wife. He was
a ph>eical wreck be-cuusc of the use of
morphine and chloral and died during the
first night of his stay in the sanatorium.
According to the denosltton of Philip S.
Jones, a colored trained nurse who had
been in attendance upon Kohn for the last
two years. Miss Thurman informed him
that she had taken Kohn's pocketbook
from under his pillow and that it con
tained JWX) in currency and S2000 in drafts.
Owing to the absence from this State
of neÂ»:ly all the material witnesses, the
evidence taken yesterday was of a tech
nical medical character, the only enliv
ening incident being a caustic reproof ad
ministered u the management of the
.sanatorium for attempting to make a
mystery of the affair. It was while Aaron
AeMer was on the stand that the Coroner
asked Deputy Mf-ehan why he had net
eubpenaed Mies Dean, a trained nurse
who was in the hospital when Kohn died.
Mr. Meehan replied that Adler had re
fused to give iiim any information as to
the facts of the case or the names of
the nurses in attendance. Coroner Le
land thereupon informed the jury that the
people at the hospital had refused to give
the deputies any information; that the
woman who had represented herself to
be the wife of the decedent had hurried
out of town, and that the suspicious ac
tions of the hospital authorities had given
the case at the outset a very bad look.
Dr. Donald Gedge. under whose care
Kohn had been placed, testified that death
.was caused by chronic morphinism and
paralysis of the heart, the latter having
been caused by the action of chloral upon
that enfeebled organ. Before going to
deep that night Kohn took two and a
half teaspoonsful of "Â¦dormio." a prepara
tion containing 50 per cent of chloral
hydrate, his usual dose being three tea-
Rpoonsful, or 00 graJns. The decedent was
almost dead when he arrived at the hos
â¢pital. The woman occupied the room with
him that night and raised an outcry when
she awoke about midnight and found him
dead. She "took on" somewhat, but. in
the opinion of the witness, did not seem
to' take the matter ?o much to heart as a
wife would be expected to.
Chemist Charles L. Morgan told the
jury about his having found a small
quantity of chloral in the stomach of the
dead man. He could not make any tests
for arsenic became the body had been
embalmed with the usual arsenical prep
aration. He thought that death was
caused by the action of chloral.
Morgue Surgeon L. D. Bacigalupi testi
fied In* corroboration of the testimony of
Dr. Gedge as to the condition of the heart
<*f the decedent.
Sanatorium Authorities Are Censured
for Withholding Evidence.
DEATH DUE TO CHXORAL.
Miss Thurman is suffering from nervous
prostration and is able to see no one. ac
cording to the nurse who answers calls
at lier apartment in the Potomac building.
George Trude, her attorney, tays he has
not vet learned what evidence she has to
uffer that the is Kohn** widow.
"1 should not be surprised if it were
found that Kohn owed more than he
possessed at the time of his death," said
Â«iic of the persona familiar with the case
to-day.
Kohn did not inherit a large portion of
she 12,000,000 estate of his iather. Provis
'. jp.s In the will prevented his getting his
â¢chare of the millions until ten years after
his fathor's death. Had he lived another
year personal property would have been
â¢iivided cyuaily among him, his brother
and his four sisters. As it is a petition for
administration filed to-day states that
Kohr.'s estate is not worth more than
$*l,O0O and there are heavy debts against
this.
CHICAGO. Oct. 15.â Instead of a fight
for millions of dollars, Dot Thurman's
<iuÂ«Â»st for the supposed wealth of the late
\braham Jl. Kohn may dwindle to a hunt
lor cents. Her sensational claims as
widow at Kohn, who died suddenly in San
Francisco last Friday, and her hurried
irip half way across the continent to push
ihem may prove a* vain as a search for
a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
Miss Thurman Is Reported to Be
Prostrated and Evidence of
Her Marriage Is Not
Produced.
The judges, who were Hon. Ralph C.
Harrison, Frank Dunne and Percy Long,
had considerable difficulty in choosing the
winning side, but finally the trophy, a
silver cup. was awarded the girls.
Following the debate was a dance, dur
ing which Hunt refreshments were served.
One incident caused considerable amuse
ment. One of the Wilmerding Club
.speaker?, in the course of a most elo
quent denunciation of Immigration, point
ed to Chinatown as an example of the
harm done to San Francisco by immigra
tion. The young lady whose turn it was
to speak next held up Paul Jones as an
example of the good done by immigration.
Immediately the first speaker announced
that thÂ« debate was on the present time
and not the past, to which the young lady
retaliated by calmly reminding her oppo
nent that the exclusion act was passed
ten years ago.
About 7<X) people who attended the de
bate in Golden Gate Hall last evening
left in a quandary as to whether or not
immigration is detrimental to the United
States. The decision of the judges was
that it is not detrimental, but the ques
tion was so skillfully and broadly argued
by both sides as to give the victorious
dub the decision by a very narrow mar
gin.
The debate was contested by the Wil
merding Debating Club and the Lyceum
JJterary and Social Society, both of the
San Francisco Dobatir.g League. The
Wilmerding Club was represented by Wil
liam Holdenreich. Fred Berg and Milton
Clark, who maintained that immigration
was decidedly detrimental to the coun
try, while the Lyceum Society, represent
ed by the Misse? Albrecht, Dinklage and
Braur.stein, proved to the satisfaction of
the committee that rather than a detri
ment the foreign clement is a decided ad
vantage to our Government.
The question was discussed from all
sides, morally, physically, financially and
politically. Each speaker was allowed
lifteen minutes and in two instances, on
the male side it was necessary for the
speaker to take his seat before he had
concluded his argument.
The marriage of the Striinzes took place
October 31, 1900. They only lived together
four months, Mrs. , Strunz leaving him
after thev had quarreled.
Suits for divorce were filed by Harry
P. Roberts against Evallna Roberts for
infidelity, Harriet M. Crane against Fred
S. Crane for desertion, Melota Estrada
Smith against Robert O. Smith for neg
lect, Marie Rice against Charles Rice for
neglect, Etta Hurt against Andrew J.
Hurt for intemperance, B. M. Kroh
against G. H. Kroh for intemperance and
N.0ra Flaherty against E. J. Flaherty for
desertion.
Â¦Interlocutory decrees of divorce were
granted to Theresa Sorensen from Wash
ington Sorensen for neglect, Lillian A.
Corbin from David E. Corbin for deser
tion, Bula S. Bright from Fred R. Bright
for neglect, Mary L. Walton from Rich
ard H. Walton for desertion, Louise Brit
ton from George Britton for neglect and
Kate Miller from George F. Miller for
neglect. (
Hazel Strnnz, who when she led the
Amazon marches at the Tivoli a few years
ago was known as "Big Hazel," the larg
est chorus girl on the stage, and who is
now known as "Hazel Sanger' No. 2 from
the right" in the Florodora sextet now
playing at tKe Columbia Theater, grace
fully bestowed her six feet of shapely
femininity in the witness chair in Judge
Graham's court yesterday and told his
Honor that she had left her husband, W.
V. Strunz, atid would not under any con
sideration return to him. She said she
was perfectly willing that her husband
should Ret a divorce on the ground of
desertion, so Judge Graham accommo
dated her and gave him an interlocutory
d^ee. The one child of the couple, a
boy who is eighteen months old, and
whom the father has never seen, was
given into the custody of the mother.
Strunz, who is also a member of the
theatrical profession, did not appear. He
was represented by Attorney Charles A.
Lee. Mrs. Strunz, however, was support
ed by three members of the Florodora
troupeâ Lillian Gilbert, Julia Coghlan and
J. A. Duncan. They all testified on be
half of Mrs. Strunz, saying that since
they knew her they had never seen her
in the company of Strunz.
Northern California has beaten the
record in getting oranges early into mar
ket. Yesterday the first oranges of the
season came down from J. Parker Whit*
ney, at Rocklin. Auburn County. This em
phasizes the claim that was the basis of
the Thanksgiving citrus fair in the ferry
buNding in this city, that claim being that
the earliest oranges come from this part
of the State. Jay T. Nash, president of
the American Produce Company, says
that this is the earliest record for oranges.
The fruit was sold for 55 a box.

YESTERDAY, WHEN THE VANCOUVER TEAM PROVED ITS
MARKED SUPERIORITY AT THE CANADIAN GAME.
PARIS, Oct. 15. â There is no truth in the
report that Mrs. Potter Palmer Is lying heie
serioueljr 111. â¢
Britt May Be Able to Meet Seiger.
There has been such a decided im
provement in Jimmy Britt's injured foot
that he may be able to meet Seiger
shortly. Seiger will be at Corbett's at 6
o'clock to-night to weigh in. Manager
Greggains will then decide on what he
will do regarding the match.
Rather than return home with their
title in doubt the Irishmen decided to
come here to meet the Vancouver team.
The game takes place at the National
baseball grounds. Ninth and Bryant
streets, to-morrow afternoon, commen
cing at 3 o'clock. It promises to be the
finest exhibition of the- Canadian game
ever seen outside of Canada. It will be the
first time the champions of the east ever
met the champions of the west under a
foreign flag. ,
The Shamrocks of Montreal, the cham
pion lacrosse team of the world, ar
rived from the north yesterday by rail
for their game with the Vancouver team,
which so signally defeated the Tecum
sehs. The Irishmen have been acknowl
edged champions for years, but some
three weeks ago their colors were low
ered by the Vancouvers. A week later
the tables were turned by the champions,
until now each team has one game in
the series of three which will be played to
settle the world's championship^ The de
ciding match was to have been played
in Vancouver the day before the British
Columbia champions were due to leave
for this city to meet Callfornian teams.
It rained that day and the game had to
be canceled.
Will Play the Vancouvers To-Mor

SHAMROCK TEAM ARRIVES.
The members of the Continental Gun
Club opened the - season in an enjoyable
manner- at their Alvarado preserve.
They had an elaborate banquet on Wed
nesday evening, which lasted almost until
it was time to go in quest of the duck.
The members and guests present : were:
Members D. Ostrander, W. Fisher, C.
Rivers, J. Llebert, H. Scribner, G. Smith.
H. Lercke, F. Nicholsen ; guests J. Ran
dall, T. J. Curley, F. J. SIme, C. B. Kauf
man, F.E. Schober.
The season opened with the marshes
about Suisun fairly alive with
gunners. With the break' of day
the fusillade began and * continued
several' hours. On the "preserves
where the best shooting was 'Â¦ ex
pected :; some disappointment was en
countered, owing to the fact that the un
usually, warm weather of the past few
days . caused r the birds to leave the ponds
and go 'â to the ' bay. Notwithstanding f this
drawback, however, Â¦ many "good' strings
The ducks will afford great sport on
Sunday, as the conditions are all favor

guests had a good day's sport at his. ark.
H. Vollmer, John Walker and Tom
Vincent" also returned heavily laden.
George H. Newman, Fred Stanley, Ed
Mouldrop and C. N. Davis . secured the
limit near Mount Eden. .
The members of the Pastime Club who
were out were: George Carlson, John
Best, Fred Bell. John Castle, . Carson
Lewid, Fanzer, Cook and Johnson.
The majority of the ducks were north
ern birds which undoubtedly came down
with the recent storm. To the sportsmen
their presence here now presages an early
'winter. The birds are chiefly sprig, wid
geon, teal and spooneys. They were all
in good condition.
The seven members of the Spooney Gun
Club secured the limit, the combined bag
being 350 ducks> : Those present were
L R Larzelere.'TDr. E. N. Short, George
Morse, Dr. E. T. Mervy, Rod Guyett, Mr.
Wolf and Mr. Brommer.
NEVER in the history of duck
shooting in California was there
a more auspicious opening day
than yesterday, according to the
heavily laden sportsmen who re
turned last night from their preserves.
There was a gunman every hundred
yards on the Alameda marsh and the
majority of , them bagged their limit of
fifty ducks. Around Alvarado and the
bridges there were countless thousands of
ducks upon which the gunmen could ap
parently make no impression. .. â¢

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 15.â An awaken
ing of the judges disturbed a tete-a-teU
in the free-for-all trot at Agricultural
Park this afternoon. There were only
four starters and the first betting saw
Forest Wi driven by McDonald, a 10 to 7
favorite over the field. It so happened
that McDonald owned Iloilo, the con
tender, over which Hughes, a gre<. n
driver, held the reins.
With the money set right pleasant
weather was encountered by Forest W
in the opening heat, which he captured
handily from Iloilo in 2:17. After this a
squall blew up. A kick wa3 lodged with
the stand by a bettor who took exception
to the handling of Iloilo and Walter
Maben was substituted behind the horse
in place of Hughes. This action changed
the entire complexion of affairs. Forest
W had been stlling favorite after the first
heat, but Iloilo went out and took three
straight heats with ridiculous ease. Be
fore the third heat the winner brought
15 against 4 for Forest W and Lady Madi
son and George W. AIcKinney.
The attendance was good, but the bet
ting was not heavy nor spirited. Cam
baceres, at short odds, was the lonely fa
vorite to land. Owing to the sudden re
versal showm by Loyal S, Bozeznan, who
rode the gelding yesterday, was sus
pended by the judges. The entry of Loyal
S was also refused pending an investiga
tion.
Phyz went to the post a 6 to a favorite
for the first running event, and, without
being afflicted with much speed, finished
third, backed from 5 to 1 to Z to 1. Botany
made all the running, winning almost
easily from Homage, which came up with
a late rush.
In the five furlong scramble following
Loyal S turned a delightfully invigorat
ing somersault. On Wednesday Bozenrm
rode the gelding and his performance was
a buccaneer's dream. To-day at 6 to 1.
with Powell up. Loyal S collared the fa
vorite, Estado, in the run home and was
awarded a nose verdict over Blue Miracle.
Weight and Jockey Maddox -proved
more than Maresa, the 6 to 5 favorite for
the third running number, could nego
tiate. The mare showed speed, but was
unplaced at the wire. Troy looked a win
ner at the paddock, vrhtn Kunz cama
with a rush, the 4 to 1 shance. Thisbe.
getting the decision by a head from
Myrtle H. Troy was third, a neck away.
Down in this country the black horse.
Cambaceres, is a vtritable Hindoo. Powell
had the mount on him again in the mi!e
and a sixteenth selling affair, and at even
money made a cathop of it. scoring hand
ily from Illowaho. The latter was the
runner-up throughout. The show fell to
Searcher.
There were seven starters in the con
cluding dash for two-year-olds and tha
winner turned up in Red Cross Nurse, a
5 to 1 shot. It was a very close fit at the
wire. Pat Bulger losing by a nose only.

ADDRESSES RUEF'S NEIGHBORS.
.The biggest meeting addressed by the
Mayor was at Washington Square Hall at
North Beach, under the auspices of the
Schmitz Central Club. The building was
packed to the doors with men, women and.
children. The small boy was present in*
large numbers, this being Ruef's home,

Mayor Speaks at Three Meetings,
but Says Nothing New.
Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz spoke at
three meetings last night, and Abe Ruef,
his mentor, was busily engaged in figur
ing up the* evening's inroads into the
campaign fund of the Union Labor pai*ty,
which Dame Rumor says Is supplied by
Ruef himself.
Schmitz addressed two gatherings of the
Labor Union party in the Mission and
then hurried across, the city to North
Beach to appear before a gathering called
by the Schmitz Central Club.
While the Mayor's . financial support
seems to be at high water mark, his stock
of campaign speeches seems to be at low,
tide. Ruef supplied plenty of small boys
last night to cheer Schmitz and spent
money recklessly for bonfires, but the
Mayor was ,forced" to repeat the' same
speech' three times and his sentiments
were but an echo of previous 'evenings, .v
At Manzanita Hall, Fourth and Perry
streets, about 200 people were gathered to
listen _ to the Mayor. , W. J. Kennedy of
the Teamsters' Union presided and
speeches were made by Harry Knox,
Michael Coffey, M. F. Farland and Dr.
Dillon, all of ,whom are candidates on
the Union Labor ticket. Their speeches
were not startling and when\Mayor
Schmitz arrived he livened things up and
gave Ruef's small brigade of boys 'an op
portunity to cheer. . Â¦Â¦Â¦
SCHMITZ REPEATS HIMSELF.
School Director,, Roncovieri was â¢'the
next speaker, but his speech was drowned
by tho noise of the> audience stampeding
from the hall, and the School Director ab
ruptly finished his remarks: . ' -,Tv
"Again 'the Mayor thanked those present
for, listening to him and assured 'them
that if elected again: he would show.him
self "worthy of support" and proud to
obey their -wishes. -: â¢ r ' j
; Schmitz forgot,' however, to tell his
audience that - certahi , vacancies | would
occur on the city's commissions next year
and' that, ifv elected,' he had the power
to make - appointments from : the caliber
of men from which Parry of "colt" fame
and Mershon were chosen;
The- Mayor repeated a previous speech
by saying that the city's executive could
not do much in two years to carry out a
programme, and f that , in four years it
would be possible to carry his plans to a
finish. Â¦ - â¢ ' 'â¢
He insisted that his supporters should
not heed the, campaign stories of his op
ponents andrthat he was making an up
hill fight, : relying on his political record.
He denied thp assertion that he desired
to control the various commissions of the
city, government and branched off to laud
the Board of Education as a epecimenof
the work achieved under his regime.
'The Mayor forgot, .however, to point to
the "record" achieved by some of his ap
pointees, such as: Michael Casey of- the
Board of Public Works, Hutton of the
Police Commission; Parry of "colt fame"
of the Fire Commission and Mershon,
late of the Civil Service Board.
BELIES ON HIS RECORD.
The Mayor forgot to tell the audience
just what part he, played in securing the
purchase of the car lines or the fact that
the. bargain had been clinched before he
was elected.
"Yet three months after my election,"
said Schmitz, "the biggest financial deal
known, in this. city. 'was put through. I
mean the sale and purchase of the street
railroads."
He went on to say that all his meetings
were well attended and that they were
a tribute to t he principles he stood for,
of equal rights to all and especial privi
leges to none.
Then the Mayor repeated the old ptory
of how it was 'predicted two years ago
the election of a Union Labor Mayor
meant the withdrawal - of capital from
San. Francisco.
an election."
on November 3 next. He assured those
present. that, he considered each one of
them a friend and that he appreciated
their support and jollied his hearers by
telling them : that'"if the election depend
ed on you there would be no need to hold
met at Pythian Castle last night and ex
tended enthusiastic greeting to candidates
on the Republican ticket. The audience
was addressed by E. H. Aigeltinger, Mau
rice L. Asher, Thomas C. Duff, Theodore
Lunstedt and Fred Eggers. The'club will
hold an outing at Shell Mound Park' next
Sunday.
'--judge Bahrs followed and delivered one
of his strenuous speeches. . He surprised
bis auditors by,, his eloquence ' and i won
many' votes -by â¢ his. ""sincerity. Robert
Vance also spoke well and to the point.
He :Â¦ argued that r the workingmen - owed
much to the Republican party and he'ad
vised them to get behind the ticket and
help gain a victory.
Senator Wolfe made an ideal chair
man. His introductory speeches were
helpful to the various candidates who ap
peared before the gathering. His tribute
to John J. Greif, the candidate for County
Clerk, filled the hearts of Greif's friends
with joy. Greif was' overcome by the kind
things said of him. He said if elected he
would conduct the office in a business
like manner. Maurice Asher, Judge
Bahrs, Robert Vance, General E. S. Salo
mon, Fred Eggers, Harry Baehr and
other candidates made speeches. Judge
Joachlmsen was among his friends and
was given a generous reception.
Henry J. Crocker arrived at the meet
ing late in the evening. His entrance was
the Eignal for great cheering. He was
escorted to the platform and in introduc
ing him to the assemblage Chairman
Wolfe said:
Next year*will b* an v important one in the
history of San Francisco. We have millions
of dollars to expend for public improvements.
Â¦\Ve muM have men In office who are tried and
true â men cf experience, men of honesty, men
of ability. We must have a man in the office
of Mayor who will aptxiint men to commis
sions that are capable of discharging their
dutlee. We must have a man for Mayor who
will know no distinction between rich and
poor; who will treat all people alike. We must
have a man for Mayor who will see that every
dollar of the public money is expended In such
a mr/.iur that the public will Eet value for
it. I know .we have such a man. He sits
right here on our, platform. Our next Mayor,
Hrnry J. Crocker. - (.Great applause.) / .
When the cheating had subsided Mr.
Crocker looked 1 mo the faces of the resi
dents of the district and with a smile
said:
It seems to me the Mayor is going to have
a great deal to do to keep the promises made
by his ardent friends. However, .the Mayor of
Ean Francisco will have the appointing of
commissioners, who. under the great power
given by the charter, will have the handling
of those vast ftums which Â¦ we have voted to
be expended with equal rights to all among
the various districts in San Francisco. The
fact that I will be thi: next Mayor- of San
Francisco (applause and cries "That's right")
grows upon me every time I go . around this
vast city. and see the h<vts of people who are
taking up the cry of good government and the
proper expenditure of public money. . I i feel
sure--4n fact. I feel confident from the good
tidings I have received, that the Republican
ticket will receive a good majority.
Men good and true, men who win back up
ttus administration, will be elected. - Now you
have listened to a great many things to-night.
I am going to suggest something. This Thir
ty-eighth District is very business-like. It Is
one of the most compact districts in San Fran
cisco. I think it breeds more politicians
(laughter) than any other district in this city,
and when those politicians get together as they
have in this campaign . there is nothing to it
at ail. It is absolutely eolid. (Applause.)
Now the State has a habit of presenting to
the county that roll* up the highest vote a
silken banner and that banner Is contested for
from time to time. Now I am going to make
a suggestion to the Republican party, and that
is this; they ptit up a silken banner to be con
tested for 'by the districts,' < and I am ready
to wager that the Thirty-eighth District will
carry away the banner at 4he coming election;
I feel absolutely certain that the Thirty-eighth
will give the Fortieth and the Forty-nrst, two
strong Republican districts, a close fight, for
the honor of possessing the banner. \
- 1 have little to, Bay about myself. I simply
want to assert that my heart is in this fight.
I am willing- to give up my private business
affairs and. devote my time to the /welfare of
this city./ I believe that 'at the -coming
tion we willroll op a big Republican majority
and I feel certain that the Thirty-eighth Dis
trict will hold her 1 end up. ' (Great applause.)
Isidore Golden, a bright young orator
of the Republican party, entertained the
assemblage early in the evening with a
keen criticism of Franklin K. Lane. He
said Lane was a mediocre lawyer and
while in office had done very little work.
He said that for the last six years Lane
had been "doing politics." He claimed
that Lane did more campaigning than he
did municipal business. He called atten
tion to some of the incompetent opinions
rendered by the City and County Attor
ney. He said the Democratic standard
bearer charged corruption in the City Hall
and he thought the Democrats were re
sponsible for this, as they have had
charge of municipal affairs for the last
six years. Golden aroused a great deal of
enthusiasm.
Senator Edward I. Wolfe presided last
night over one of the largest and most
enthusiastic Republican meetings ever
held in the Thirty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict. It was held in Mascot Hall, Golden
Gate avenue, near Buchanan street. The
hall was far too small to accommodate
the hundreds of voters who crowded the
place. The room was intensely warm and
yet the residents of the district were con
tent to remain standing for hours in or
der to greet and hear the various candi
dates.

constitute about as much of a financial
burden as the average candidate can bear,
and therefore immunity from Illegitimate
assessment is relief at the right time.
The workmen of the Union Iron Works
gave Crocker a greeting that was rather
reassuring than otherwise when he mado
a visit of several hours' duration yester
day to the works. The foreman escorted
the Republican candidate for Mayor
through the various departments â¢ of the.
establishment, and more than 2000 work
ingmen gave' him a pleasant greeting and
shook hi9 hand. Many were wearing the
Crocker campaign button. Â±t was not a
visit for speech-making, for no speeches
were made. The affair partook largely of
a personal nature, with the pleasant eat
impressions left. In many cases these im
pressions will doubtless result to the ad
vantage of Mr. Crocker. It was some
time after the noon hour when Mr. Crock
er started for a drive around the city,
giving him a needed rest before the task
of addressing throngs at the three meet
ings of last night, viz.: at Twin Peaks
Hall, Thirty-fourth Assembly District;
Harmony Hall, Mission street, Thirty
sixth Assembly District, and Mascot Hall,
Golden Gate Avenue, Thirty-eighth As
sembly District.

Nominees in general are 'glad that the
Registrar and Election Commissioners ex
posed the fraud, and killed the "graft"
of the so-called' Non-Partisans. Legiti
mate expenses of a political campaign
The red pepper episode at Steimke Hall
threatens to embitter the feud between
McNab and Lane on one side and Schmitz
and Ruef on ; the other. The McNab
crowd charge Ruef with the offense 'of
sprinkling the pepper on the Lane, floor.
Schmitz charges Lane with something
worse than throwing red pepper. The
versatile candidate for Mayor accuses
the great jawsmith of the political arena
of' resorting to dishonorable campaign
work and threatens, to hold him person
ally responsible for the circulation of
scurrilous cartoons. In view of the threat
ening aspect of affairs there is added sig-
that an old page from an Improvement
club's "book of signatures was used to
enlarge the list of names on the petition.
One of the Registrar's clerks recognized
his 'own signature which he placed on
the roll of an improvement club one year
ago. Lane's name for Mayor headed the
so-called Non-Partisan list of nomina
tions. Several Republican candidates
were indorsed or nominated, but It does
not follow that any one of them knew
what the promoters of the scheme were
doing to obtain signatures to the peti
tion. Thomas W. Hickey. chairman of
the late McNab convention which nomi
nated Lane for Mayor, was at the Reg
istrar's office : at a late hour Wednesday
night and early \ Thursday morning.
James P. Booth was also there. The ex
planation was made yesterday that Booth,
who is a candidate for Supervisor, de
sired . to . be . placed at the head of the
Democratic list of 5 candidates for that
office. The explanation Â¦ is accepted as
plausible in view of the fact that a sam
ple of the official ballot given out yes
terday by the Registrar shows the name
of Booth at the too of the Democratic
candidates. for Supervisor.
The office holders, however, are not
unanimous, as several insurgents in the
Department of .Public Works refuse to
burn incense at the Schmitz shrine or
worship In the temple of A. Ruef. What
the Schmitz supporters lack in numbers
they make up .for in for pro
ducing noisy demonstrations of welcome
to their candidate. .
Recently Mr. Ruef's Mayor, the versa
tile Eugene E. Schmitz, spoke In his own
home district and was, very well received.
Kind inquiries were made concerning the
health of Parry and the colt. The amen
ities of the campaign were not violated
by the Introduction of red pepper as an
element of agitation. There was no great
demonstration in honor of the Mayor, In
a political sense the home meeting was a
disappointment. In the municipal com
paign two years ago Schmitz was hailed
as a great leader. The atmosphere was
charged with enthusiasm for his candi
dacy. In the present campaign the en
thusiasm for the Mayor comes- mainly
from those wh6 are on the municipal pay
roll by the grace of the executive.

Republican Nominee for Major Is
Given Hearty Reception
The attendance at the meeting of the
Republicans of the Thirty-sixth Assembly
"District held last night In Harmony Hall,
on Mission street, near Thirteenth, was
gratifying!*- large. All the voters of the
district turned out togive the candidates
of. the historic party a fitting welcome.
Henry N. Beatty presided, and introduced
Thomas C. Duff, John J. Greif. General
E. S. Salomon. JudÂ£e George H. Bahrs,
Harry E. Bachr, George R. Wells, 'Rob
ert Vance and other candidates. The re
< eption given to Henry J. Crocker, the
nominee for Mayor, was a flattering one.
When he took his seat on the platform
the voters cheered Incessantly. Mr.
Crocker delivered a forcible speech to the
assemblage. In part he spoke as follows:
CBOWD HABMONY ttat.t.
BAKES BOASTS DODGE.
Judge Georse II. Bahrs. candidate for
Assessor, delivered another . forcible
speech. He took another fall out of As-
Dodge, who. he said, was trying
?o. monopolize all the credit for posseys
wig civic Integrity and virtue. Judge
â¢IJahfs called attention to the fact that
Dr. Dodge had drawn thousands of dol
lars out of the city treasury and did not
return the money until the Supreme Court
compelled him to do so. In the course
of his speech he said:
I welcome this fiffht Â»*"* I am willing to
meÂ«Â»t Mr. L>odge on any irs\t<: Involved in this
< ampalfrn. I am satisfied 1 will not eet the
worst of It in this struggle. I am willing to
Hand upon my record and I am not -ejrotlstl
c&L I eay in making that record I simply did
my duty. Â¦ When Mr. Dodse took office the
â¢Â¦barter lrrovtded- that his ealary should b*
$4000 a j*ar and that provision, was placed In
; the charter to &o away with the conditions
â¢,hat previously existed. Dr. Dodge claims he
Â»* a friend of the charter and yet he riolated
it. He withheld flC.OOO,' which waa the per
(â¢vntajre of thÂ»- rwJkax collected, lie did not
yield it up until he was compelled to do eo by
the Supreme Court. That money did not come
<m of th* lax of corrx>rationi>. but out of the
lÂ«iokets 'of thÂ» laborlcE man. Dr. i I>odee in
unworthy of their fupnert, an he Is a sham.
It is my duty to tear the mask from this man
and place h la. record before you.
Speeches were made by Robert Vance,
candidate for Supervisor: John J. Greif,
candidate for County C'crk, and a score
of other candidates. They wore all given
hearty receptions and promises of support
.from the district.
llr. Crocker had other meetings to at
tend and was unable to stay. As he left
the hall he was cheered again by the
assemblage.
EVERYWHERE that Henry J. Crock
er went last night the cheers of
enthusiastic citizens rang In his
cars. He was hailed with great ap
plause at every meeting he attend
ed, and if his receptions are any
\ iiierion he will eurely be the next Mayor
â¢J;"tnis city and county. Mr. Crocker does
uot boast of being an orator, but his
speeches are listened to with the most
.'intense interest. He talked to the citi
zens cf three districts last night in a
Â¦business-like manner and made a deep
Impression on 'their minds.
ile first attended the meeting of the
Crocker-Nrland Club held in the Twin
Peaks Hall, Seventeenth street, near N6e,
vhlch is in the Thirty-fourth Assembly
district. When he arrived he found the
'all densely packed with voters. He re
.7::ai:;ed In the background until Judg-o
Â¦ â¢ Â¦â¢-:.' H. Cahrs, the candidate for As
â¢. had concluded his terrific roast on
r.cuxnbent of that office. Mr. Crocker
v.'.is Â»srortÂ«*d to the platform and re

I anntng. Deputy United States EHstrlct
Attorney, was chairman cf the meeting
! ir.trcduct'd the standard bearer of the '
publican? party. He introduced Mr.
â¢ : , k<r as the next Mayor of San Fran-!
9 and the applause was deafening.
;Â»!r. Crocker spoke as follows:
. : tfatak what the chairman has paid â¢will be
: n^t because 1 am Fuch a strong man
. .is the people of San Francisco, but be
â¢ the people of San â¢ Francisco, without

Â¦ â¢ have a Republican administration in

Thcre is no doubt in the world that
-, . lo. we will have an administration that
w a credit to the city. I look like a
broad-ehouldered man. .who can take

paUtjr and handle them without cloves.

GOOD TAXPAYERS.
â¢ Tfce Thirty-fourth District is recognized prin
aliy because of the t&xpaying citizens who
.re-sick- !r. it. You don't eee many apartment
I -â¢" - OSt here. You see the homes owned
by the residents. People buy their own land,
. }-ut U] their own houses and then organize itn
: . r.t clubs. Tbey come before the city
rorersaeBt and make their demands. It is
Â¦H*ll known that the improvements are brought
>>oat by the clubs. The clubs have made
coeiiact&s demands and although yoa have
t pot all you asked for. you certainly have
POC enough to show that this part of the city
: ;.s improved faster than other parts of the
Now you ere Interested, therefore In the
.Kinds you voted for a few weeks ago. As
â¢5-howa by the returns from this district, the
mttttlta were almost unanimous for the char
ter and for the bonds. That certainly shows
a progressive spirit and good common sense
<n the part of you residents. Now. we -want
to know that we ere striving to make this
me of the greatest Republican victories that
has ever taken place in San Francisco. There
e-e two or three reasons for It. We have an
Idea that it is due to the Republican national
rarty. which has bet-n so successful throughout
ThÂ© United Ftate*. to roll up a b!s majority
.'.n order that we mirht show that this city
:s not polryr to b* behind in the protection
cf its own interests.
WHAT PEOPLE WANT.
.The people want w rnend money in order
that It will fcrir.E about iirottcticn to them
selves. The lTncrcA ements of this city will
bring about euch protection to its inhabitants,
as they will have better sanitary conditions.
I take it this district Is vitally Interested in
these Improvements, as you have put up a
man who will certainly be elected. I refer to
Joseph S. Nyland. (Great applause and cheers
for Xyland.) lie certainly will represent you
a? fairly and honestly as any man on the
tirket.
â¢ Now, I have very little to Fay about the Re
publican uarty. There are *orne i>ecple here
who.no doubt don"t belone to that erand old
party but who are going to think very eeriously
bow they are going to vote this year. They
are. in my opinion, going to place their voteâ
Â¦ and I eay this without egotism â in the ballot
box for the Republican standard-bearPr for
Mayor end \-ote for the entire Ite'iublican
ticket. (Applause.)
There was more hearty cheering for Mr.
Crocker when he left the hall. The meet
ing 1 was an enthusiastic one and bodes
well for the success of the Republican
ticket.
There is no need of personalities In . this
campaign. Now there Is no necessity for that
You are all pood, cold-blooded voters and you
are looking- for the best for this city and you
are certainly going to throw aside all cam
paign iwui-s and look on this from a business
standpoint. I know I have been referred to
as a class candidate. I am sure I am nof.
You can take that to your hearts end know
that If I am elected Mayor of this city I will
do my level best for every class of citizens.
I was told that the laboring: man was of that
class who would not vote for me and yet I
was invited by a delegation to visit the Union
Iron. Works. \v hen 1 went down there to-day at
*:30 o"clock and went through the machine
shops, the boiler shop, and blacksmith shop
and all the other departments ' of that great
industry: *hen I waa taken around by the
various foremen and Introduced. I found men
wearing the Crocker button.
I am pleased to say that I believe that I
will surprise the people of San Francisco by
thÂ« vote which Henry J. Crocker and the Re
publican ticket will get from the worklngmen.
(Great applause.)
You people realize perhaps as much and
more than any others the result of your votes
on the recent bond election. I can say that
this cleans a great deal to our city. I know
what can ba done for this district. I know
what can bo done for our Echools. Improve
ments can be made on.Peabody School; your
streets will be improved as was Third street.
What we want Is an administration that will
be the best we ever had. Now the papers
have all taken that up and I am sure we will
have on administration -here that will redound
to the credit of San Francisco and if I be
pardoned in saying so. I am the man In whom
you can place Implicit reliance In bringing
about these necessary Improvements
PERSONALITIES NOT NEEDED.
PROUD TO LEAD. \
It la one of the Pleasures o r my life to be
soupht as one. fitted Â¦Â¦ to take hold of the relna
at this time and guide, In a humble way, the
destinies of this city. Â¦

fleet of graceful windjammers whose tfajllng
feats made the stars and stripes a synonym
for speed In the waters of many lands. The

Farcical Football Game Does Not
Even Give Cardinal Eleven
Hard Practice.
"What came near being the record
breaking football score for the Pacific
Coast was made on the Stanford campus
yesterday when the cardinal eleven piled
up 57 points to the goose-egg of the team
of soldiers from Fort Baker. So easy
were the b'oys of the artillery corps for
Stanford that It was not even a good
practice" game. The collegians merely ran
the ball down to the goal In one, two,
three order, never giving their opponents
a chanca even to breathe.
The first touchdown was made in-thre-e
minutes, the second in two, the third in
three again, and so the continuous pro
cession down the field went on until the
referee's whistle gave the soldiers peace
ful respite. Only once did the boys in blue
make their distance, and then they were
so surprised that they immediately
fumbled the ball and lost it to the car
dinal.
Lieutenant Hawes, their coach, who is
an old player from the Virginia Military
Institute, .sat disconsolately on the side
lines and recalled that his team of gun
ners had been scored against by -Nevada
last week even to the sad tune of 45 to 0.

FASCICAI* GAME AT SEATTLE.
Tbe strain cf playing good ball for a
couple of days told on the Angels yes
terday at Recreation Park. They col
lapsed ere the game had rounded into
shape and from the third Inning on the
Cripples piled up runs, while the Ar.gels
confined themselves to making errors and
swinging wildly at the stray ones Dtver
caux sent over the pan. Ecor?: Oakland
8. Los Angeles 3.
Young Bauia received that bad. kind of
support the southern teara is wont to give
him every time he pitches. At times the
Cripples landed hard on the offerings of
the youthful slabster, yet many of the
bingles were made when the side should
have bten retired before any runs were
put over the pan.
ThÂ« Angels opened up the trouble with a
bunch cf three. Then they were done for
the day. Not another man reached the
home plate. Devercaux seemed to have
them under the spell of his peculiar de
livery for the next eight innings and they
were never in the Â£oing.
The Cripples got one off Baum in the
initial round. In the third they opened up
again and made three on as many hits
and more errors. The game was not lest,
however, till the fourth. Then with two
g-one and O'Hara and Schwartz on the
tags. Dr. Moskiman cleared the right
field fence and the three came in. Mts
serly repeated the stunt on the center
Held enclosure in the seventh. The bags
were all empty at that time. The score:
Oakland. t Los Angeles.
B. Ward, the father of the decedent,
swore that while the parties .were quar
reling and standing by the table,. Eushnell
picked up the lamp and dashed It to
pieces on the floor close to Mrs. ', Bush
nell and set the table cloth on fire. The
witness ran out of the door with the
burning cloth and did not re-enter the
house until the doctor came. The wit
ness refused to swear that Bushnell
struck his wife with the lamp or aimed It
at her. Before throwing the lamp Bush
nell said. "You'd better go home." Then
he brandished the lamp two or three
times around his head before throwing It
down. â
Such was the 'essential portion of the
verdict rendered by the Coroner's jury
yesterday afternoon In the. inquest upon
the body of Mrs. K. Bushnell, who died
In the French Hospital on October 8 from
burns received on September 12 at her res
idence, 214 Seventh avenue. There was
some positive testimony to the effect that
Mrs. Bushnell told several persons that
her husband had thrown a lighted coal
oil lamp at her and had set her dress on
fire. Dr. T. J. Petne, who was called in
Immediately after the burns were re
ceived, testified that while he was dress
ing Mrs. Bushnell's wounds she said to
her husband, "This is the last time you'll
throw a lamp at me." The doctor testi
fied further that both Mrs. Bushnell and
her husband were drunk. When the wit
ness asked the woman about the matter
later on she denied that her husband had
thrown the lamp.
Mrs. W. Tiedemann, who lives in the
flat upstairs over that occupied by the
Bushnells, told the Jury how she heard
Mrs. Bushnell screaming and calling for
her. She .went downstairs, passing the
husband, who was standing on the front
porch, and she found the Injured woman
on the bed with her clothing burned off
her body. She said to the witness, "Har
ry threw the lamp at me." Then turning
to her husband Mrs. Bushnell said.
"That's the last lamp you'll throw at
ire." Her husband made no reply to
either remark. She told the witness after
ward that her husband had thrown the
lamp and that she would not live with
him any more. She added that when her
husband came home to supper she had a
quarrel with him and she left the house
and went to her mother's, and that when
she returned the quarrel was renewed and
he picked up the lighted* lamp and threw
it at her. Â¦
*^'Owing to conflicting evidence we, the
jury, are unable to determine whether
the lamp was accidentally exploded, over
turned during a scuffle, or whether it wa3
thrown" at Mrs. Bushnell We recommend
that the mattter be more fully investigat
ed and that In the proper courts the hus
band be required to clear himself of the
suspicion that he threw the lamp, there
by causing his wife's death."
The petition of the Western Pacific
Railway Company for a franchise on
Sixteenth and other streets went over for
one week.
The petition of the Santa Fe Railroad
Company for an extension of four months*
time to construct a steel bridge on Nine
teenth street was referred to the Board
cf Works for a report. Similar action
was taken with the petition of property
owners that a sewer be built In Buena
Vista avenue and thfe application of F.
T. Newberry for permission to treat the
roadway of Second avenue with heavy
oil. " . - -V Â¦'Â¦
Chairman Curtis said that the Arctic
Oil Company, to which the Union Oil
Company succeeded, had been ordered tÂ»
remove the obstructions, but had failed
to do so' and the latter company was oc
cupying city property to which it had no
right. The committee decided not to con
sider the granting of the privilege for one
year, as recommended by the Board ot
Works, and insisted that the company's
representative appear at next Thursday's
meeting and agree to remove the oil tank3
from the street at once.
Owing to the absence of any represent
ative of the company, temporary permis
sion was granted for one week to use tha
spur track. Captain A- H. Payson of the
Santa Fe Company consented to the con
dition that if the obstructions are not re
moved the spur track will be ordered
taken up in thirty days and the Santa Fe
will refuse to run its oil cars on tho
track.
I The Supervisors' Street Committee yes
terday gave the Union Oil Company to
understand that its application for a per
mit to maintain a spur track already laid
on Illinois street to connect with the
Santa F e system would be denied unless
the corporation would agree to remove
certain obstructions consisting of oil
tanks from the roadway of Illinois street.
A crowd of students gathered at Berke
ley Station after the rally and a few pro
posed to board a train and hold It up. as
was done after last year's rally, but C.
L. Smith of the sophomore class and other
cooler heads prevailed with speeches and
the crowd dispersed.
A pit full of howling, roystering, frantic
students curled around a big- fire gave the
'C7 freshmen football eleven the biggest
rally to-night any freshman eleven ever
got at the University of California. There
were TOGO people there, filling every scat In
the new Greek theater, all of them doing
tbe!r best to , scare the plaster off the
Â¦walls with their shrieks and warwhoops.
There was a lot of speechmakingr, too,
and it all wound up with the serpentine
dance around the pit, that engaged two
or three thousand young men, hugging
arms by twos, threes and fours.
"Phil" Carey, the yell leader, waved as
much ginger Into the rooters as his White
shirt sleeves would let him.* J. E. Road
house assisted him in the capacity of
master of ceremonies. President Wheeler
was the first called upon, and just as he
was about to begin his speech some one
repeated one of the president's phrases,
"It is sood to be here."
"Which . is iust what I was about to
remark," replied Dr. Wheeler. "The
freshman eleven is usually rather an un
reliable lot, but we expect them to go
straight thiough to victory. They -are
not overconfident, but just about confi
dent enough to lilt the line hard every
time. We expect you freshmen to roll
up touchdowns until you have a victory
that can never be forgotten. We expect
you to do eood. hard work for our be
loved university."
Jesse Steinhart, '01, recalled the old days
when Garry Cochran was at California
and aroused the students to enthusiasm
before the big games; Colonel George C.
Edwards of the athletic committee told
a good slory: Trainer Christie told the
freshmen to "Hit them again, boys, hard
er"; Claude Kern, captain of the fresh
man team, promised to hit the line as
hard as he could; Professor C. LÂ». Cory
proposed the "Oski wow-wow" yell and
told how necessary it is to enthuse; Roy
Smith, ex-yell leader, said there wasn't
half enough yelling, and Sam Stow, the
varsity guard, stirred up the crowd with
pleas for harder work and more-enthusi
asm. Â«

CHICAGO. Oct. 15. â The sentiment in the
wheat pit was decidedly bullish throughout the
day and the volume of trading was large.
Opening prices were firm on higher cables and
on a private dispatch from Buenos Ayres
stating the crop vu damaged by frost. De
cember was up H@%c at 79>4@79>4c. and with
active covering by shorts the market became
firmer. Substantial advances on the outside
markets with the cash situation at Minneapo
lis strong tended to Increase the anxiety of
the shorts. The feature of trading was the
heavy baying of prominent houses which had
previously been on the bear side of the mar
ket December advanced to 79 T /gC but late In
the day a prominent trader turned seller, dis
posing of In the neighborhood of 1.000.000
bushels of December, "and this caused a loss
of part of the gain. The close, however, was
strong, with December up *Â»e at 79%c.
Corn ruled firm, being helped largely by the
strength In wheat. There was more or leÂ«s
covering by local shorts. December closed a
ehade higher at 45%Â®45Hc.
Oats did not follow the upward tendency of
wheat and corn. The market was dull. De
cember closing *Â»c lower at S6%c.
Inactivity of trading caused weakness in
provisions In thÂ» face of an advance of from
10(gl5c In the price of hogs. The- close was
weak, with January pork off 12}4o, lard 17^4
g20c down and ribs 17V4c lower.

: The new representative was on the plat
form : in the convention hall when Jerry
Simpson , was first . : nominated for Con
gress,' and it was he whio conceived the
fiction of Simpson's antipathy to socks.
He printed a story about It In his father's
paper next morningâ a story that caused
Jerry ; to- be dubbed ."The Sockless Socra
tes of Kansas." ' It was he.'also, -who con
ceived the idea of a Government lottery
for^the disposition of the lands of the
Kiowa.Comanche, and Apache Indians' in
Oklahoma to white settlers. His plan
was adopted by the Governor. Murdock
v. r as Â¦ invited to a reception 'given by Pres
ident Diaz, In Mexico, two years ago, and
not until he: was . In : the presence - of the
dictator, did, he realize that he had for
gotten his collar.â Wichita Correspondent
Imthe New York Herald. . ; .
Victor Murdock's' mother, who is a niece
of one of the early Governors of Mary
land, was a very handsome young woman
and when the war broke out she rode on
horseback over Douglas County,- person
ally inciting the patriotism of young men
to a defense of the Kansas border.' She
was then but 17 years old. Only : three
men in her countyâ the postmaster,, a
preacher and a i crippleâ failed; to enlist
In defense of Kansas. ' ' l
Chairman Wilson at once set y to work to
recognize red-haired local â¢ workers in
every precinct. Fred Dold, son of a Buf
falo, N. Y., packer, a red-haired Demo
crat, was the firsÂ£ to contribute to the
campaign fund, sending his check for
5100.. Young 'Murdockâ he is now only 32â
came from, 'a: stock- famous in Kansas.
His father was a printer on the Herald
of Freedom when Quantrell made the
raid on Lawrence that ended In the his
toric massacre. Quantrell's gang chased
him to a well, where he caught hold of
the rope Â¦ and slid down. Several shots
were fired Into the well at him, but none
hit him., ' * ; . T r -> Â»
To show his recognition of the men who
he felt had" brought about his nomination
Mr. Murdock's first act was the designa
tion of Judge Thomas C. .Wilson of Sedg
wlck County, a red-haired man, to be his
campaign manager and committee chair
man. He also appointed a red-haired
stenographer for campaign headquarters.
Anil they did organize. Next day Smffh

hotel at Topeka, that the next Representa

the^idta, 'an'd' r the. red.-headed . men : of the
Seyenth' District, regardless of politics or
prejudices, j took the "matter* 1 s^ml-serious
ly and became .'enthusiastic' -..over it. As
the Â¦. campaign- progressed ,' Murdock' s
chance became bright. Every red-headed
Republican in the district. wOi ked strenu
ously to be made a delegate, an<i when
the convention met at Great Bend on
April 3 a good 40 per cent of 5ts members
had red hair, | and one of the most re
markable things in the history of Kansas
politics occurred. Murdock was nominat
ed on the' first ballot against nineteen
other candidates.-
"Smith, do you know that the red
headed men of this county have' never
been fairly treated \ Notwithstanding the
fact that ten- out of every one hundred
Americans have red hair, we have never
had a red-headed President since ! tbe
time of Thomas Jefferson. We must or
ganize." ;.- . â¢ â¢ â¢
. Victor Murdock was attending the Leg
islature for the Wichita Eagle, of "which
he * was .'managing editor, and:; a' warm'
friendship, existed between ' him ( and
Smith; who , was, geographically, the
strongest candidate in the race for Con
gress. The neld, with the exception of
Murdock, was fighting Smith. I",
.One night, in a jocular mood, Murdock
said: . â¢ Â¦ i.-"- â¢ : ;
Victor Murdock of this . place. Repub

caused by the resignation" of Chester, I.
Long, who was elected to/ the United
States Senate. . The Issue which Murdock
forced t othe front in his campaign was
one not mentioned in any State or national
platform every writtenâ that of red hair.
His fight for election was carried -on by
an drganization which has been dubbed
"The Short Grass League of Red Heads."

Long was transferred to the Senate,

candidates to succeed him. ' Two of them

RED-HEADED MEN
* : MADE STTCCESSFUL FIGHT
The . examination touched upon the
meeting later in Cincinnati/ at the Gib
son House, when Johns and Ryan were
alone again In the former's room from 9
p.-m. until midnight, after, which Ryan
said he' would settle the next morning.
Witness denied that he then told Ryan,
"here, are the goods," or that "it took
mighty clever work to get Christiancy'a
name to the document." ;
The witness handed Ryan ,the letter
about the decision the next morning and
the latter paid him $1000 in cash and gave
himtwo checks, one for $2000 and one for
$1400. These payments, with $100 advanced
previously at Terre Haute, made $4500.
RYAN PAYS FOB' SEBVICES.
The scene over what is called the "Jim
telegram" was most dramatic. ; Johns said
that "Jim" I was a nickname for - D. V.
Miller, and that the telegram read: "Let
ter sent. Have not written him. Go
promptly,'.' and signed "Jim," was from
Miller and that It referred to the decis
ion which, the Government claims, was
sent to Johns when no letter about It was
sent to Ryan, the prosecution -holding
that.it was intended for Johns to see
Ryan first, etc. Johns testified â¢ that he
did nothing the day he got the "Jim" tel
egram, but that the next morning he re
ceived two letters, . one for himself and
the other for Ryan, . when he communi
cated with his client.
The witness testified that 'when they
first opened their conversation 'in Ryan's
room he told Ryan about Miller being his
close .friend, who had .advised him to
practice before the department. Johns
said he and' Miller had been personal
friends for' years and that the latter
would give due consideration to his peti
tions. Johns denied that he had asked
Ryan "What Is it worth to you to get a
favorable decision?" He denied having
said he could get a clear bill of sale or
anything of that kind, or that. he could
get a fraud order issued. ,He denied hav
ing asked Ryan'-for ?5000"' and finally ac
cepted $2500 for the legal work. He de
nied that he had told Ryan that Miller,
would .revise the turf literature or help
In doing so. ' Â¦/ ' .. : ;
Much time was consumed in explaining
letters and telegrams that passed between
Johns, Miller and Ryan, which had been
put in evidence by the. prosecution. ...
MAKES NTJMEBOUS DENIALS.
Joseph M. Johns, one of the defendants,
testified .th^at he had lived in Rockville
twelve years and was Deputy Prosecutor
the last five years. He first met D. V.
Miller in 1890, when he introduced him as
a -speaker at a political meeting. Â¦ After
ward he had been employed with Miller
in cases and they were closely associated.
Last spring -Miller came from Washing
ton to try a case at Rockville. Miller
then told the witness that practice before
the Postofflce Department was desirable.
Johns said there was no arrangement be.
tween them and nothing like a conspira
cy, but that his duties as Deputy .Prose
cutor did not require all his time and he
wanted other business. He then made a
study of the United States statutes on
postal business. He solicited service
from the Cheage Commission Company of
St. Louis, as well as from J. J. Ryan &
Co., and wrote to other concerns;-
His letters to Ryan finally brought the
conference in the Fillbeck Hotel' at Terre
Haute. There he found a man who Intro
duced himself as Mr. Rose, who after
ward turned out to be John J. Ryan. ;
JOHNS ON THE STAND.
CINCINNATI. Oct. .15.â In the trial of
Miller and Johns for' alleged conspiracy
to extort a brlbe < the Government rested
this afternoon and the defense introduced
evidence for three hours. One of the de
fendants was still on the stand . when
court adjourned. ' â¢ â¢
All of the witnesses of the Government
ta-day were Federal officers or former
employes of the Government, the most
prominent being C. A. G. Christian'cy,
who was First Assistant Attorney in the
office of the Assistant Attorney General
for the Postofflce Department when D. V.
Miller was the. Second Assistant . Attor
ney, or the next in rank to the witness
under the Tyner administration. Chris
tiancy, while no longer connected with
the Postoffice Department, . was a start
ling witness in testifying, that Miller had
not submitted some important matters in
the Ryan case to him and had* misled him
in regard to the ' others, notably In the

ing contained in a letter signed by Chris

Identity. -- His trunk was brought to the
Coroner's office last night. In it - : were a
number of letters from a 'woman .'who
signed the name "Etta Gardner." Their
general tone indicated an 'attachment -on
the part of the writer toward, the recip
ient, but the last one, dated in -February;
spoke of breaking off Â¦ ttte Â¦ intimacy.' This
was dated at Riverside, Cal.', and as Miss
Meade was In Boston at that time they
could l not have been â¢ written, by .< her.
There were photographs ; of several other
women in : his . 4 trunk, . without : names,
which were taken by a Los 'Angeles pho
tographer. , The only thing to; Indicate his
connection with Miss Meade was one ! of
her cards. ''â¢'$&&Â£i Â¦Â¦' V . '
considerable amount of money, a lady's
gold watch and a handsome rosary.
Among her effects there was nothing to
indicate that she had encouraged the at
tentions of her .murderer, and. from all
that could be learned she had discouraged
his advances for . several years. - , Father
-Hartnett, her nearest relative in the'clty,
took charge of the body and the effects.
The body was removed to an undertaking
establishment late, in the afternoon and
willl be prepared for shipment to the dis
tracted family in Los Angeles.
The only clew to the identity of 'the
murderer was a baggage check . calling
for a trunk delivered to the. Union Trans
fer' Company.. Detective! Harry Bralg
solved the mystery promptly by locating
the trunk, which bore the ' murderer's
name In f large letters.- : He- made a thor
ough search of its contents; but failed '.to
find anything that would throw any light
on the cause of the tragedy. He Â¦ found
two . typewritten letters -from - BQSton;
signed "Your cousin, Leo." "The first .was
dated October 29 and among some unlm
pprtant matters said: "I found that
party lived at 31 Wlnthrop ' street,
Charlestown, Boston. Are 'living, with a
man named John Hartnett and his sister,
an old bachelor and -'an old maid. - 1 did
not have much time to find out any more,
as I had to get back to New York." The
other letter was dated: February 2 and
said among . other Â¦ things, "That: young
woman is " still here that : I told , you
about." These prove that Schmidt had
kept close tra^ck.of Miss Meade's 'move

ttat> FEABS OF ; SCHMIDT.
On September 23 last she made.applica
tion to the Board of, Education for a'po
sitlon in the San Francisco Evening
School Department."* She stated* In her ap
plication that ' she had had one - year's
training . in the State Normal School ; at
Los Angeles and was a graduate, of the
Boston Normal. School. She also held a
grammar school certificate ; valid in Los
Angeles County, and had had three. years'
experience In teachingâ two years in
schools of Los Angeles County ; and one
year in the. Los Angeles city, sch6ols. It
was her intention to attend lectures at
Berkeley, In the daytime and teach school
in the ' evening. ; -
She had frequently told her friends that
Schmidt, had; threatened her. life on occa
sions and she had a /ear of him. F Her
family did not share her fear,, but; consid
ered his attentions objectionable and
wished her to remain ; away from i him;
She was 23 years old * and of a lively and
lovable disposition, f
On: the body, of the girl were found a
The identity of the dead girl was first
established by Mrs. Robb, who lives at
1S1D Laguna street, where Miss Meade
had roomed ever since her arrival in this
city, about three weeks ago.' Mrs. Robb
thought that the girl had come ' from
Los Angeles, where her mother resided,
and at first intended entering the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley as a
student She paid one visit to the uni
versity and finding the charges greater
than she had expected had held her 3e
clsion in abeyance until she heard from
her uncle, from whom she expected as
sistance. Mrs. Robb said that the girl
had made a favorable impression on her
and her family. She had never had any
visitors, except on one occasion, when a
man called whom she understood to be
an attorney.
Under the body of the dead girl was
found a bundle of. letters from school
friends in Boston enclosed in an envelope
addressed to Rev. John Hartnett, assist
ant pastor of St. Joseph's Church. The
letters contained nothing of. importance',
but the address of Father Hartnett speed
ily solved the mystery of the dead per
sons' identities. Father'Hartnett was lotH
to talk of the tragedy, but he consented
to tell what he knew of the relations ex
isting, between Miss Meade and her
slayer. .
He said that the girl was a cousin of
his and that she was a niece, of Father.
Hartnett, who Is Vicar General of the dio
cese of - Los Angeles. She was one of
three children of Mrs. Helen Meade, ; her
father having been dead j several yeacs.
The girl was born and reared Ik Los An
geles and was a graduate of the Normal
School there. After her graduation from
the Normal she had - taught I schools of
Los Angeles for two years. : He had un
derstood that , Schmidt, whom she had
known for several years, i became so in
sistent in. his | attentions that her mother
concluded to send her East for ; further
schooling. She went to Boston and spent
two years there, attending â¢ school and
making her home- with another cousin,
John Hartnett, and ; his sister at ' 31 Win
throp street. Charlestown. She came to
San Francisco from Boston , three weeks
ago, intending to obtain If possible a place
in the public schools here.\ . *

themselves with frightful insistence to
maintain their proximity to the horrible
sight. Three policemen from neighboring
beats guarded the remaina from molesta

bodies placed in the morgue 'wagon* im

Â¦witness of the shooting. Green was on
his way home to lunch and alighted from
a Sutter-strect car at Laguna street with
the Intention of proceeding to his home
Just as he got off the car he heard a
pistol shot, and looking up toward Bush
street he saw the murderer deliberately
shoot four times at his victim.. The wom
an kept- moving toward her assailant
while he was shooting and finally fell for

' C. Stcinfels. who conducts a butcher
shop at Bush and Laguna streets, in front

told the story of the murder and suicide
as he saw it, corroborating, the details
tfven above. Steinfels says he noticed
Schmidt at various times during the fore
noon waiting around the corner, but Dald
little attention to him. He was sitting in
his shop .when Miss Meade passed the
corner and a few minutes afterward
hoard a shot.
"The murderer walked slowly down
Laguna street, emptying his revolver as
he went. Nobody followed him. After go
ing about 100 feet he backed up against an
Iron fence, still holding the revolver in
his hand, which he had reloaded during
his walk. He held the revolver up in the
air and fired one shot. Then he looked up
and down the street and, placing the re
volver to his forehead, fired again. He
sank In his tracks and apparently never
moved again. After he fell a crowd of
men came running up and shut the hor

MUBDEEEB ENDS tttr LIFE.
"I was dumb with terror, and in my
mind I kept wishing that some one would
aid the girl, as I felt a premonition that
she was doomed. A fireman was standing
on the corner, and' she approached and
ppoke to him. As she did so I saw the
man who followed her draw a revolver
from his coat pocket place It to her back
and fire. I can see her agonized face now
as she turned half-way round and faced
her murderer. He continued to shoot un
til she sank to the sidewalk. I was ab
solutely numb with the ghastllness of It
ell, and even against my will I stood and
Â¦watched the last scene of the tragedy.
"The girl seemed surprised at seeing the
young man, and apparently extended a
cool greeting to him. He at once began
conversation, and although I could not
hear what he said from his gestures I
judged he was talking vehemently. He
repeatedly stamped his foot and shook his
fist. When he first spoke to her he wore
colored glasses, but he removed these dur.
Ing the interview. He kept running his
right hand Into his coat pocket, and it
crossed my mind that he had a revolver
there. The girl repeatedly shook her head
and finally walked away from him toward
the corner. He followed her, stllL'protest
ing, as I judged from his actions.
"I was sitting in my window when I
saw the dead girl pass down Laguna
street. Shortly after she passed the corner
of Bush street she was accosted by a well
dressed man. whom I had noticed loiter
ing in the vicinity for several hours. It
was 12:15 o'clock, as nearly as I can place
the time, when I noticed the man and the
young woman engage in conversation.
They were standing at the stairway that
leads up to the rooms over the butcher
shop, about thirty feet from Bush street,
on Laguna.
One of the women living in the neigh
borhood who saw the occurrence from the
time that the murderer accosted his vic
tim r.'ive the most complete account of
the crime. She said:
"I wasn't going up against a man with
5 gun," he explained- "He walked away
Jowly and I kept my eye on him. If
he had started to run I would have taken
after him."

H or woman, Paul L. Schmidt shot
H and killed Josephine Meade shortly
after noon yesterday. The tragedy oc
curred at the corner of Laguna. and Bush
streets. Walking down Laguna street to
about tha center of the block, the- mur
derer coolly emptied his revolver of the
spent shells, reloaded it and, placing the
muzzle to his forehead, ended his own
life.
The double crime was witnessed by half
a dozen housewives living in the block
en Lsguna street where the deed was
committed. From the windows of their
houses they saw the beginning and end
of the tragedy. Frozen with horror they
watched the young woman sink to the
sidewalk dead with four bullets In her
body and then watched the desperate
murderer as he leaned against an Iron
fence and paid with his own hand the
forfeit of his crime.
Four men at least also witnessed the
chocking end of two young lives and one
of them, J. W. Hillebrandt, attached to
the Underwriters' patrol at 1915 Bush
Btreet, acted an inglorious part in the
tragedy. It was to him, big and brawny
end dressed in uniform, that the woman
appealed for Â¦ assistance before she was
shot. According to his story, she ap
proached him at the corner of Busk and
Laguna streets, the murderer following j
closely at her heels. She held out her
hand, in which she held an envelope, and
said:
"1 beg your pardon, but this man "
Before she could utter the sentence in
full the slayer pulled a revolver from his
coat pocket and shot her in the back.
Hiilcbrandt made no effort to interfere,
according to his own statement, but ran
into the butcher shop on the corner and
vx-atched the remainder of the tragedy
from the safe seclusion of the building.
When asked If he had attempted to im
pede the murderer he answered no. He
did net even try to arrest him after the
commission of the foul deed, but watched
him walk slowly away.

This affair with unhappy Josephlna }
Meade was the last of three passionate- '
love affairs. He jilted another girl for
her. A year or more ago nÂ© was madly
devoted to Effle Gardner, daughter of a
Spring-street bookseller. That affair is
understood to have languished on account
of the displeasure of Mrs. Gardner In the
two going to the tournament of roses in
Pasadena without consulting her. Ha
next . lavished his affections on Bessie
Brown, the daughter of a contractor in
this city. This is the girl he is said to
have jilted.

Girl Victim of Tragedy Mourned by
Eastern Relatives.
BOSTON. Mass., Oct. 15.â The relatives
with whom Miss Josephine Meade lived
while in this city were greatly shocked
when the news of the young woman's
murder was brought to them, by the
correspondent of tha San Francisco Call.
"While In Boston Miss Meade lived with
the family of John Hartnett at 34 TVin
throp street. In the Charlestowr. district
and right under the shadow of the Bunker
Hill monument. Hartnett is a wealthy
liquor dealer and his wife is a cousin of
the murdered girl.
Miss Meade came to Boston from Los
Angeles fifteen months ago. "While here
she 'spent the greater part of her tim*
In study. She left for California on Sep- m
tember 7Â«last, according to the Hartnetts.^
They say she was studious, quiet and re-Â»
served. They heard from her often and
she never mentioned the name of any
admirer or lover. So far as they knew,
she did not figure in any love affair.
Last June Miss Meade graduated from
the Normal School, receiving a certificate
qualifying her to teach in any school in
Massachusetts. She intended to remala
in Boston and teach here, thinking that
greater opportunity was offered in tha
East. Her mother, however, insisted on
her returning to Los Angeles. Much
against her will the girl returned to Cal
ifornia. Mrs. Hartnett received a letter
from Miss Meade only two days ago and
at the time of writing the young woman
bad not visited her mother at Los Ange
les.
