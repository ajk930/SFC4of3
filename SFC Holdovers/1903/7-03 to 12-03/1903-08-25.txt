Mooney money have made frequent visits
to Jones' office in the Parrott building
with a view of learning his whereabouts,
but their questions hava met with the
indefinite reply that he was expected
home any day. Two weeks ago It was
said that he would return in another
week and at the expiration of that time
his friends begged for further time, ex
plaining that hs had not been heard
from but would surely be back In a few
days. He is still absent, however, and
his wife seems as much worried over his
present whereabouts as those who are
concerned In the affairs of the Mooney
estate. One of Jones' friends said yes
terday that the lawyer had been acting
strangely for some time prior to his de
parture and had complained of not being
able to sleep at night.
SPENDS MONEY RECKLESSLY.
Jones appeared haggard and worried
and was in the habit of absenting himself
from his office for days at a time. In re
gard to this statement it was said at his
office yesterday that it was not unusual
for him to disappear for days and the
fact was cited that some time ago he left
his otrice one afternoon and the next
that was heard from, him was in the
shape of a telegram dated Chicago.
When he finally returned to the city he
said he had been on a train that was
stalled in the floods in Kansas City and
that be had been confined in a hospital

For a number of months Jones had
been spending his money seemingly In %
reckless manner, a fact which his friend*
noticed. At times he would complain of
being financially cramped, but later
would exhibit funds in plenty, which his
friends thought represented some of the
fees he was earning'. Â° It has been claimed
that he recently became Involved In a
mining scheme and lost a lot of money
and another story has gone abroad that
he was a heavy gambler, but this latter
statement is emphatically denied by hla
more Intimate friends.
The Mooney estate, the funds of which
Jones is expected to account for. has
been attracting some attention by reason
of the attempt of Con Mooney and his
brothers to break the will on the ground
that Michael was incompetent at the tlxna
he executed it. Another action has also
been brought by Con Mooney, who claims
half of the estate on the ground that a
partnership existed between Michael and
he for more than thirty years.
The lawyers were on tha eve of com-*
promising these suits last week when the
fact that the funds of the estate were
missing became known. Naturally Con
Mooney and the other relatives, whom
Michael cut off with $1 each In his will,
are eager to locate Jones and carry out
the settlement which was interrupted by
the lawyer's leavetaklng.
Judge Coffey has set the matter down
on his calendar for a special hearing on
Thursday.
Jones, for a number of years, was
prominently identified with a number of
local societies, and particularly with tha
Welsh society. In which he was a hard
worker. He Is a native of Wales and had
a large following among his countrymen
in this city.

reducing the bond to $4000 and adding the
requirement, as provided by law, that the
moneys of the estate should be at once
withdrawn from the three banks and
forthwith deposited in the California Safe
Deposit Company.
The next day, according to the evidence
in possession of "Judge Coffey. Jones se
cured for Mrs. McNamara a bond In the
sum of $4000 and then had her. as admin
istratrix of the Mooney estate, give him
a power of attorney, with which he pro
ceeded to the three banks and withdrew
$12,000 remaining of the- cash left by
Mooney.
MONEY AND LAWYER MISSING.
It was about this time that Jones dis
appeared from the city and from the day
he left up to a late hour yesterday not a
word had been received .from him or from
any. one who knows where he is. Some
days later the attorneys who are repre
senting an absent heir to the Mooney es
tate had occasion to Inquire into the
stewardship of Mrs. McNamara and for
the first time they learned of the reduc
tion of the .original bond and the subse
quent order for the removal .of the money
from the three original places of deposit.
In issuing this order Judge Sloss had
committed an error, which the inquisitive
attorneys called to the attention of Judge
Coffey, who had returned from his vaca
tion, and he at once Instituted an investi
gation. Fully satisfying himself that ir
regularities had been practiced. Judge
Coffey last Thursday .summoned Mrs. Mc-
Namara before him and thoroughly ques
tioned her regarding her connection with
the reduction of the bond and the removal
of the money from the banks. It was
soon made plain to the Judge that the
woman was blameless of any wrong in
tent, but had, simply acted on the advice
of her attorney, supposing that he would
place ' the funds of the estate in the
vaults of the California Safe Deposit
Company, as ordered by Judge Sloss.
ADMINISTRATRIX REMOVED.
. Judge Coffey, however, decided that
Mrs: McNamara was not equal to the re
sponsibilities of administratrix of the
Mooney estate and promptly suspended
her and Issued an order substituting Jo
seph Haber Jr.,, a son of the well-known
capitalist, as future ' custodian of the
Mooney funds. The banks of the city, so
far as the investigation of the court has
progressed, have no evidence' of cash de
posited by 'Attorney Jones, and this fact,
together with his strange disappearance
from the city, has \ aroused against the
lawyer ,the strongest suspicions, which
the. explanations of his much-surprised
friends and charitably inclined acquain
tances fall to remove..'

she appointed him, according to her
statement made to Judge Coffey, until

Michael Mooney died in 1900 leaving an
estate consisting of 514,000 in cash, which
was deposited in three banks, the Hiber
nia Savings & Loan, San Francisco Sav
ings Union and Columbian Banking Com
pany. This money Mooney bequeathed to
a daughter, -Mrs. Mary Dolan of Phila
delphia, leaving. his sisters and brothers,
among them Mrs. Ann McNamara of 1404
Golden Gate avenue and Con Mooney,
each $1.
Judge Coffey has started an investiga
tion, the results of which will be pre
sented to him on Thursday morning, when
he will call for an accounting for all mon
eys belonging to the Mooney estate and
duly install a new' administrator In the
matter.
Jones left the city rather mysteriously
about three weeks ago. It is claimed by
those attached to his offices in the Par
rott building that he is in the vicinity of
Santa Barbara, trying to recuperate after
a long spell of sickness. But those who
have furnished this information are un
able to give his correct address and his
wife also appears to be living in igno
rance of his exact whereabouts. Imme
diately after the lawyer left the city the
startling discovery was made that funds,
amounting to $12,000, representing the bulk
of the estate left by the late Michael
Mooney, a brother of the well-known Con
Mooney, had disappeared, and a hurried
investigation developed the fact that the
money had been drawn out of three banks
by Hu Jones. From the time the cashiers
of the respective banks turned the cash
over to Jonea no trace of the coin can be
obtained, a fact that leaves an inference
most damaging against the lawyer.

The autopsy on the body of Van der
Velde, held yesterday by Dr. Bacigalupl,
showed that the deceased came to his
death from valvular disease of the heart.
As a precaution the stomach was sent to
the City Chemist and the inquest will be
deferred until his report is obtained.
Abram Binneweg of Oakland was the
only one of the dead man's friends to
manifest any interest in him after death.
It is stated that Van der Velde. after
pouring out a fortune at Monte Carlo and
in Paris, lost $150,000 in an investment in
a ranch in Alabama and in a race horse
named The Grafter in Australia. That
was six years ago, and it marked the be
ginning of his financial ruin. -

dry sand, and he became, so irresponsible
financially that his relatives were obliged

magnificent, wicked, eyes, her marble-like
skin and superb figure were the envy of

at this period she met Van der Velde.
Her Intimacy with him must have been
short, as 6he soon fell a victim to the
charms of Rigo, the Hungarian gypsy
violinist, who charmed away the vagrant
heart of the erratic girl with the wild,
romantic melodies of his nomadic race.
Her relations with Rigo became notori

while the complaisant Prince secured a
divorce In Paris. For years the couple led

Turks May Exterminate the Bulgar
ians in the City.
SALON ICA, European Turkey, Sunday,
Aug. 23.â An insurgent movement is afoot
in the vilayet of Salonlca. It Is feared
that it threatens Vadena (forty-six miles
from here), Salonica and other towns.
Well informed persons here share in the
general disquietude. Large bands are re
ported to have been organised by Alban
ians, who, it is expected, at a given sig
nal may resort to general incendiarism.
The Turkish population Is resolved,
should great disturbances occur, to ex
terminate all the Bulgarians in this city.
Consequently a large number of Bulgar
ian residents are leaving Salonica.
SAL0NICA IS FEABFUL.
Anarchy exists at Losengrad. Fighting
is proceeding everywhere In the neighbor
hood. Insurgent bands have occupied the
strategic points around Malkoternevo.
Eight villages to the north of Losengrad
have been burned by Bashl-Bazouks. The
insurgents attacked two Turkish posts ln
the vicinity of the same town and killed
the entire garrison, consisting of sixty
soldiers and one officer. At Almogic sixty
Insurgents engaged In fighting with 300
Bashl-Baxouks. The result Is not known.
The town of Bunar Uissar has been
burned and a part of the Bulgarian popu
lation was massacred. The rest of the
Bulgarians fled to the mountains.
At Burgas Maju, after eighteen hours*
fighting, the garrison was killed by reb-
The churches were demolished, Hhe
houses sacked and the town is now a heap
of ashes. The populace fled to the hills,
where they are ln a starving condition.
The Dnevenik also asserts that a general
massacre has taken' place ln the whole
vilayet of Monastir. Nearly all the vil
lages have been destroyed. The treacher
ous murder of eighty insurgent prisoners
by their guards has made an especially
bad Impression here. Â¦ ,-
ANARCHY AND WAR.
While many of the reports remain with
out confirmation, sufficient authentic de
tails are forthcoming to cause the author
ities the gravest anxiety. According to
the Sofia Dnevenlk, the Turks committed
unspeakable atrocities at Krushevo. The
mutilated corpses of ninety women and
children were found ln one building;
pieces of the bodies had been thrown into
the street. Fifteen of the principal mer
chants of the town were killed and their
heads exhibited on poles at Monastir.
WOMEN AMONG VICTIMS.
SOFIA, Aug. 24.â Travelers who ar
rived here this evening from Adri
anople state that a massacre of
Christians occurred there Sunday.
One version says the guns in one
of the forts opened fire on an insurgent
band, which had attacked a military out
post. A panic followed inside the town
and the Mohammedan population fell upon
the Christians.
With the rumors of massacres and
slaughter of prisoners In Monastir now
authenticated, the general situation is
considered here as fast becoming intoler
able. Official and diplomatic circles alike
are concerned, having every reason to fear
that only a part of the horrors enacted in
the Interior of Macedonia have come to j
light as yet. The revolutionary commit- J
tees are doing their utmost to force the j
hands of the Bulgarian Government, and
the immediate outlook is exceedingly se
rious.
It appears that the Turks have obtained
the upper hand In the vilayet of Monastir
and the insurgents are planning to remove
the center of their activity close to the
Bulgarian frontiers. Dispatches arrived
to-day from the disturbed area are exceed
ingly gloomy. From Adrianople comes
the news of a Turkish defeat and the ex
tension of a revolutionary outbreak, from
Monastir the news of Turkish victories,
accompanied by barbarous excesses.
HAVANA. Aug. 21.â The big consoli
dated cigarette factory, belonging to the
American Tobacco Company and the Eng
lish combine, was totally destroyed by
fire, with Us valuable content/", consisting'
of new cigarette-making machinery and
quantities of tobacco. Nothing was saved
txeept the books and the contents of the
office. The loss is estimated at more than
Â£30,000, fully insured.
Cigarette Factory Burned.
Following the proclamation of the rev
olution throughout the vilayet of Adrian
ople the insurgents cut all the telegraph
lines connecting the city , of Adrianople
with iho eastern parts of -^the vilayet.
There are unconfirmed rumors here that
fighting and massacres are proceeding in
the streets of Adrianople.
Reports from Monastir, authenticated
by the Russian and Austrian Consuls,
give horrifying details of the massacres
and atrocities. At the village of Armen
sko the Turks destroyed 150 housed out
of a total of 157 and massacred every
man, woman and child. The women were
subjected to the most terrible atrocities
by the soldiers. Eight revolutionists, cap
tured at Krushevo, who were sent in.the
direction of Monastir in chains, were
slaughtered by their guards. The sani
tary conditions of Krushevo are described
as revolting. The dead are lying in the
streets, stripped of every garment, the
Turks even taking: the vestments off the
body of a priest.
SOFIA, Bulgaria, Aug. 24.â The Turks
are reported to have massacred all the
women -and children in twenty-two vil
lages of the districts of Fiorina and Mon
astir and afterward to have burned the
villages. They are also alleged to have
killed a number of prisoners. The streets
of Krushevo are said to be strewn with
dead and the survivors are afraid to bury
the bodies, fearing to incur the' suspi
cions of the Turks.

LONDON, Auk. 21.â Proceedings in the
cape of Whitaker Wright were resumed
to-day. In opening for tue prosecution,
Horace E. Avcry said that Wright, being
managing director of the London and
Globe. British-American and Standard
Exploration companies, used these names
as suited his purpose for Stock Exchange
speculations and engaged wholly in ficti
tious transactions. Counsel added, as evl
deoce. that Wright controlled all the finan
cial operations of the companies, that the
much discussed speech of the late Lord
l>uffcriu at a shareholders' meeting was
written by Wright. Mr. Avory concluded
with saying that the losses of sharehold
ers in the capital of three companies
amounted to $25,000,000 and that of 389,575
shares of -the London & Globe Finance
Corporation originally held by Wright, hd
appeared to possess only 2500 shares at
the time cf the collapse of the concern.
Witnesses were examined in support of
Mr. Avory's contention that Wright
swelled the assets and lowered the lia
bilities of hie companies by paper entries,
transferring items of one company to an
other. Just before shareholders' meetings.
The proceedings were adjourned.
Prosecution Declares That Loss to

Amounts to $25,000,000.

JUDGE INSISTS
ON LITIGATION
Several former guards appeared before
the Jury to-day and gave testimony with
regard to the circumstances of their dis
missal and the duty of guards In an
emergency like the recent break. Among
them were former Guards Prigmore, Cann
and Taylor. One of the present guards
at the prison was also interrogated by
the Jury. An adjournment was taken
until Thursday to enable subpenas to
be served upon Guards Klpp, Gillis and
several others whp I it is believed will
be able to testify with regard to the cir
cumstances of the "break.
One of the Jurors was asked if Warden
Wilkinson . would be summoned and he
replied in the negative, making the signif
icant observation that it would probably
invalidate any indictment that might be
brought against the Warden if he were
obliged to give testimony In the matter.
The Jury appears to regard the investi
gation as something of a fishing excur
sion, as the lawyers put it, and will await
the disclosures made by the witnesses
before determining finally upon a course
of action. *' ' ;Â¦

this point, however, and assert it is with
in the province of the Jury to go further

lety concerning their own safety was not
relieved until they were able to call to the
miners who had been lowered Into the
shaft and could hear their response. The
men were imprisoned in three different
levels, and being separated could not com
munlcate with each other. They suffered
some from hunger, and in one level where
the water supply ran out they suffered a
great deal from thirst. The men were im
prisoned in the hole for more than six
teen hours. The news that the men were
held prisoners by the cave-in and the dis
abling of the machinery, spread like wild
fire over Bisbee and caused a great deal
of excitement, attracting a great ' many
people to the scene. The crowds hindered
the rescuers in their work and had to be
forced back by the mine police. The opera,

the necessary repairs can be made.

ADMITS HIS IDENTITY.
"Do you know this man?" I asked. "Pard,
it's all off," Bald Woods. I then handcuffed
Woods and searched him. He had no weapon
on his person. He turned to the barber and
Bald in a low voice: "If they take me away
from here I want you to rake care of my coat
until I call for it.'.' I overheard the remark
and asked the barber where his coat was. The
barber pointed to It lying on a chair near by.
I picked It up and found a 45-callber revolver
In the pocket. Woods thereupon called me a
vile name and said: "You have the drop on mo
and I will give It up. I will make you a pres
ent of the gun." He was then told to get back
in the chair and allow the barber to finish
shaving him. which he did. While I was out
for the photograph i noticed another man en
ter the shop, remain a moment and leave, but
paid little attention to him, as my mind was
centered on the capture of Woods. From the
description Riven me by the barber I have since
discovered that the visitor was none other than
Convict Theron. Theron evidently told Woods
to get out, as he thought he was' being
watched. I then had the chief and a deputy
take the prisoner to the City Jail and I began
a hunt for Theron, but thus far have been un
successful in locating him."
Wilson, when asked if he thought there were
any other convicts at large in this section, said
that he was positive that both Theron and Mil
ler were here and possibly Fahey. "I am con
fident we will get those fellows before they get
out of this bection," he concluded.
Convict Murphy who was captured Sun
day night was more loquacious to-day and
In talking of his flight said:
I was tired out from a hard trip and came
to town to rest up. I knew it was foolish but
we decided to take the chance. I put my' gun
inside of my overalls before I came upon the
street to get It out of sight. Deputy Maxwell
took an awful chance as I tried to get my gun,
but he was too quick for me and too strong
when he took hold of me. / I was taking no
chances and would have certainly killed him
If he had bÂ«en a moment slow.
When Sharkey fired I thought Miller was
killedâ you all know that Miller has been
with me. I met him at Lake Tahoe. When
Maxwell opened up I thought at first he was
shooting at me and told him then he was a
bad shot, but I think his second bullet hit
Miller.
I was standing on the corner of Second and
Center streets, talking to a lady, and glancing
up noticed a man turn the corner directly in
front of me. ! I at once recognized him as one
of the convicts, and so excused myself to
the lady. I followed him westward on Second
street, where he entered the barber shop. I
went in after him and took a seat near him.
When the barber finished the man he was
working on he called "Next." and Woods
turned to me and said, "You may have the
next turn." I told him to go ahead, as I was
in no hurry. Woods then got in the chair and
the barber lathered his face. I went out to
secure the photos of the escapes to make my
self sure that he was. the man I wanted. As
Chief keeper's office was nearer than mine I
telephoned to him. not wanting to let the man
get out of my sight. Leeper arrived in a few
moments and we immediately went In the shop
after our man. When we entered Woods at

too quick for him and grabbed him, forcing
in all the miners working on the 900-foot
and 1000-foot levels.
When the accident occurred John Mer
rill, the foreman, was let down the shaft
and was with difficulty hoisted out of it
by working one side] of the. engine, with
out accomplishing any results or learning
whether any of the imprisoned men had
been injured by the accident. Those above

the capture said:
A report arrived at 11:30 o'clock to-night
from Vista, a small station a dozen miles
east of here, that a suspicious looking

of the convicts was in that neighborhood.

him back in the seat. L.eeper informed him
that we wanted him. as we suspected him of

Woods when asked why he went into
the barber shop this morning replied:
"I hardly know. I got careless. I
wanted my beard off so as to a little bet
ter disguise myself, but It seems I played
right into the officers' hands."
"Do you realize what awaits you upon
your return to Folsom?"
"I certainly do. I believe I will be
hanged for the part I have taken, and
that is why I was desperate enough to
kill any one who should get between lib
erty and me; but it is all over now. I
expect to be taken back to Folsom in a
few days."
"Will you tell, about your travele and
who your companions have been since
leaving prison and where your compan
ions are now, If you know?"
"The only thing that would make me
tell that is my love for opium. The want
of that drug led to my capture. I thought
I could find out in the barber shop where

Chief of Police Leeper and Consta
ble "Wilson in a downtown barber shop.
The news spread about town like wild
fire that Miller had been captured, but
the report was incorrect, as the convict
caught proved to be J. W. Woods, who is
said to have been the leader of the dread
ful prison break last month.
Constable Wilson discovered Woods
while the fugitive was getting shaved in
Hanna's barber shop at 19 East Second
street, and, with the assistance of Chief
Leeper. he went into the shop, surprised
his man, handcuffed him and without a
struggle lodged him in Jail. Convict
Theron was also seen about the barber
shop. In fact, he entered the place and
held a whispered conversation with
Woods Just previous to the capture of
Woods by the officers. It is claimed that
he put Woods on his guard, for the latter
was leaving the chair with his face half
shaved when the officers dropped in on
him and blocked his escape. A diligent
search has been made for Theron, but he
has not been found. The officers still feel
confident of capturing him. -
A Call correspondent visited Woods in
the Jail and found the prisoner loth to
talk.
According to his story Woods was in
Grass Valley several days ago and from
there went to Truckee, leaving there on a
freight train for Reno yesterday after
noon.
"How have you fared as to food since
you left Folsom?" was asked.
"I have managed to get all I wished to
eat, or nearly so, although I have never
enjoyed a meal since I left prison," re
plied Woods.

"All I can do." said Sir Thomas Lip

remeasurement of Shamrock, and which
brought about no change in that vessel's
time allowance, "is to hope..for the next
race. I am free to say that Reliance sur
prised me very much on Saturday. I had
thought Shamrock would hold Reliance
In windward work. Reliance certainly is
a wonderful yacht, but there are yet at
least two races to be sailed."
With the men of Reliance their faith
in that matchless cutter ran so high that
one could not touch it with a balloon, and
from the West came the stirring news
that a bet of $300 to $5000 had been placed
that the defender would win every race.
While the interest has waned in the
event as interest customarily does in af
fairs whose conclusions are apparently
foregone, there doubtless will be another
large attendance at the scene of the con
test to-morrow.
NEW YORK, Aug. 24.â With both boats
in splendid condition for to-morrow's con

on Saturday. The great canvas hauled

that Captain Wringe has bent this main

Count Larisch-ilonnich belongs to the

Later the Count went to America, pre

and which he refused to pay.
The Public Prosecutor was Informed of
the case by some one whose name does

HONOLULU, Aug. 18.â Ever since the
Ejan Francisco reinsurance quotations on
the Helen Brewer were ma'de public ther^
has been daily interest taken in the, vessel
in Honolulu. The almost universal opin
ion locally has been that the vessel will
arrive. When the Â¦ insurance was at 60
per cent several hundred dollars were
sent up to be wagered on her to arrive.
The bulk Of the local money, however,
has been placed at 30 per cent. One pool
was formed to back the vessel when she
was quoted at 80 per'cent, and this com
pany cabled up $200 to be put on the ar
rival of the vessel. A conservative esti
mate places the local money that has
been wagered on the Helen Brewer to ar
rive at $1000. Should the vessel make her
appearance between $5000 and $6000 will .
probably be cleaned up by Honolulu peo
ple.

The body of Hodge was removed to
night to Grimes Landing, where the fu
neral will be held to-morrow under the
auspices of the Odd Fellows, to which
order the deceased belonged.
It developed to-day that Hodge worked
for Weis on his ranch near Cranmore
more than a year ago and that the trouble
began there. After separating from her
husband Mrs, Weis moved to Knights
Landing and only recently came. to WQod
land to live with her mother, Mrs. O. B.
Green. She is . now at Winters, Yolo
County.
Â« WOODLAND, Aug. 24.â Lorln A. Weis,
who shot and killed Charles Hodge at
Knights Landing Sunday evening, was
lodged in the County Jail to-day, charged
with* murder. He refuses to say anything
regarding the shooting or the Incidents
that led to it. Weis has retained counsel
and will endeavor to show at the trial
as extenuatlnjrclrcumstances that Hodge
was the caup of the separation of him
self and wife several months ago.

PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 24.â At the Com
mercial Club thl9 evening a reception waa
tendered to George H. Maxwell, executive
(yialrman of the National Irrigation As
sociation. His address strongly brought
out the great possibilities for the develop
ment of the Northwest by building na
tional Irrigation works. He urged that
all the Western States should work in
harmony and make the Ogden Irrigation
Congress the greatest . convention ever
held In the West. i i I I :

xNEW YORK. Aug. 24.-After more than
three years of preparation and effort and
the expenditure of more " than $9000 the
plan for the" excavation of Ur of the
Chaldees and other places In Babylonia
by American explorers. ha3 been aban
doned because the Turkish Government
will not grant permission to do this work
to American citizens. The failure of the
project owing to th* inability to procure
the authorization for Americans to carry
on this work, while men of other na
tionalities have been permitted to exca
cate, has been a disappointment to its
organizers, but after having been baffled
for thre^ years they' concluded that their
only course was to withdraw from the
enterprise .altaeether.
In a letter to. the subscribers to the Ur
expedition Rev. Dr. John P. Peters, chair
man of the advisory board, says:
"On June 19, 1900, application was made
for an Irade\to excavate Maughelr, Ur
of the Chaldees and Nawawsis (Eridu),
ruins in proximity. In Southern Babylo
nia, and the required topographical map
was submitted with this application. The
application was In all respects in con
formity with the law of the Turkish em
pire. governing 1 excavations.
"No permission to excavate has been
obtained, hor has any satisfactory reason
been given for the failure to grant such ;
permission. "Later, at the suggestion of
the Turkish authorities, Tel-Ibrahim
(Kutha) was submitted for Mugherr, with
the same result.
"Dr. Edgar J. Banks, director of the
expedition,, has been In Constantinople
since January 17, 1901, earnestly pressing
the Turkish Government, with the co-ope- {
ration of the United States legation, for '
permission to excavate. The committee |
has received from him from time to time \
detailed reports of the exasperating de
lays and devices on the part of the Turk- I
ish Government to avoid giving satisfac-^
tion to the request made in accordance
with their own laws. During thisÂ«ame!
period permissions have been granted to )
other persons from other nations to ex- ,
cavate, while permission asked for by our j
committee has been withheld." . !
V ,"I think some' legislation of a remedial
character may be enacted at the ap
proaching Besslon of Congress," he said,
"but there is a wide divergence of opin
ion among authorities as to what,' if any
thing, ought to-be done. The demand for
financial legislation comes principally
from the East,' but even here financiers
oftf.not in. accord. Â¦ .'
"In the West our people are not think
ing much about the matter. The West
is 'wonderfully prosperous and all of our
banks have so much money that they
are discounting: Eastern commercial pa
per every day.. The best Judgment Is* that
.whatever financial legislation Is under
taken should be purely remedial and very
brief, covering perhaps not more than
twenty-five lines."
H. H.Kohlaaat of Chicago was a guest
of the President and Mrs. Roosevelt at
luncheon. After his conference with the
President, Mr. Kohlsaat sa^d to a rep
resentative of the Associated Press that
his call had nothing whatever to do, with
any contemplated change in the Cabinet.
"It has been rumored," said Mr. Kohl
fiaat, "that I might be appointed Post
master General, but there is absolutely
nothing in that story. The President con
templates no change In that office. 'In
fact, he desires that his Cabinet, should
remain Intact, at least until the close of
the present administration. {Personally,. I
do not desire a public office, and the.Pres
ident has no 'office In his gift which I
would accept." - â¢ . - -Â¦
Mr. Kohlsaat dlfl discuss with the Presi
dent the subject of financial legislation.
For several weeks he has been- gathering
informatiorv^for, the President bearing on
the subject. *Hls'"researches have been In
both the East and {he West, and the net
results he has laid before the President. -

LAND ATTACK
IS ARRANGED
The Zimmerman men favor a conserva
tive platform, such as the party had in
Ohio four years ago, when John R. Mc-
Lean headed the Democratic ticket for
Governor, with additions for home rule,
denouncing the new Ohio code and favor
ing reforms in State institutions. The
Johnson men declare for the j reafflrma
tion ,of last year's platform, when John
son had undisputed control of the State
convention, with additional plans favor
ing 2 cents per mile on steam railways
and 3-cent fares on street railroads, and
the referendum. The platform, as well
as, the ticket and the organization for the
next year, and everything else depends
upon the settlement of the contested seats
and the places of greatest importance
on this occasion are those representing
the Congressional districts on the com
mittee on credentials.
Some of the free silver enthusiasts, wfio
are Instructed for Johnson for Governor,
are out openly to-night against Clarke for
Senator and the indications are that this
opposition will be carried to the floor of
the convention if the committee on reso
lutions includes in its report the indoise
ment of Clarke.
To-night the Zimmerman men are mak
ing desperate efforts. to maka. a brenk In
the Johnson ranks because of the in
dorsement of John II. Clarke of Cleveland
in place of Bookwalter, and in this mat
ter they have caused the Johnson man
ager* some trouble. One of the written
statements given out from the. Zimmer
man headquarters to-day charges that
Johneon first failed to get Melville M. In
galls of Cincinnati to go on Tils slate for
Senator, then Mayor Samuel M.'. Jones of
Toledo likewise declined and now Book
waiter has refused. â¢ " -V"
The withdrawal of John W. Bookwalter
as a candidate for senatorial Indorsement
to succeed Hanna has been used to-day
to advance Zimmerman's candidacy. Zim
merman and Bookwalter both reside at
Sprtngfleld and it was claimed that the
Johnson men had started the Bookwalter
movement so as to affect Zimmerman's
interests, especially if the order of busi
ness could have been nxed so that the
Indorsement for Senator would : have
come before the nomination of the State
ticket. The Johnson men still inBiat that
there must be an Indorsement for Sena
tor, although no one has been named in
Bookwalter's place. The Zimmerman men
are not in favor of the convention nam
ing any one for Senator.
COLUMBUS/ Ohio, Aug. 24.â Prominent
Democrats are In conference here to-day
preparatory to the Democratic State Con
vention of to-morrow and next day.
For weeks there has been a contest of
unusual Intensity in j the eighty-eight
countiea between - Tom L. Johnson, of
Cleveland and Hon. John L. Zimmerman
of Springfield, the two candidates for the
gubernatorial nomination, to secure dele
gates. Both came here claiming a major
ity of 690 delegates. Both base their
claims on securing the 145 delegates whose
seats are contested. Those contests will
be settled to-morrow.
The preliminary agitation Is over the or
ganization of the convention. It is con
ceded that control of the committee on
credentials means control of everything
else, including the new State Central
Committee, that controls the organizatipn
for the coming. Presidential year, as well
as the committees on resolutions, rules
and order of business and permanent or
ganization, all of which are of importance
at the present time in the contest between
the Bi*yan men and the conservatives for
supremacy. â¢

near Lake Tahoe. Dr. Brlgham was a
native of Boston but had made his resi

At one time he held a prominent place in
politics and was considered a fluent and
convincing speaker. The scientific culti

"Shenandoah" began Its second week
at the California Theater last night. The
popularity of this sterling war drama
never seems to wane. Its drawing pow
ers aria apparently as great now as when
it was first produced. The big audience
last niglt evinced its pleasure and en
joyment cf the performance by unstinted

The second week of the realistic pas
toral drama, "The Dairy Farm." drew to
the Alcazar an overflowing audience last
evening that laughed honestly and loud
ly at the quaint characters and funny
incidents of the play and that shed tears
of sympathy for the hero and heroine.
The latter, the poor girl "Lucy" of the
drama, was personated by Juliet Crosby,
an old-time favorite, whose sweet smile,
expressive eyes and graceful acting have
made her very popular. She was received
with a generous round of applause, which*
she repaid by her able and conscientious
acting. Oza Waldrop, the saucy "Mln
ty" of the cast, was in her best vein and
kept the audience divided between laugh
ter and hand clapping. Among the men,
Edwards Davis as i the I hero, '.'Nathan
Newkirk," was the bright j particular
star, his. reading and acting in the third
act being especially artistic. Miss Hart
ley, the "Eunice Jane Perkins," Lily
Branscombe, the "Hanna LJze," Marie
Howe, the "Sarah Newkirk," Zellah Cov
lngton, the "Jehu Sparmley," Tony West,
the "Joel," Theo Rook, the "Simon,"

and H. D. Byers, the "Squire." of the
cast, were excellent In their parts.

and throughout the performance the audi
ence was wildly enthusiastic. Eugenie
Thais Lawton in the title role scored a
decided hit. Besides being a very beauti.
ful young lady, she possesses remarkable
talent and is bound to be successful In al
most any part. Herschel Mayall as Ar
mand Duval never appeared to better ad
vantage. In the particularly emotional
scene at the close of the fourth act he
evoked a veritable storm of applause.
Georgie"Woodthorpe as Madame Prudence
succeeded in creating much laughter and
was frequently applauded. George P.
Webster In the part of the elder Duval
showed unusual strength." Edwin T. Em
ery as Gaston, Henry the
Count and Eva Myrle Lewis as Nichette
all did excellent work. The others of the
cast furnished admirable support. The
costumes and stage settings are elaborate.
The programme to be rendered at the
second symphony concert under Scheel's
matchless leadership, which will take
place at the Grand Opera-house this aft
ernoon, is so important from a musical
point of view that the attention of our
musicians and music lovers cannot be too
often attracted toward It. Queau Sibe
lius' "The Swan of Tuonela" and Glazou
now's "Valse de Concert." two novelties
which have been referred to frequently,
have never been heard hero before and
belong to that modern school of composi
tion which pays such strict attention to
warm orchestration. Felix Mendelssohn
is too well known and too much admired
to require any especial recommendation,
and yet "La Fllense." never having been
heard here before, is rich and beautiful
enough to be designated as truly a "ro
mance without words."
The piece de resistance of the pro
gramme, however, will be Beethoven's
masterpiece, the third symphony, or bet
ter known as 'JEroica." Scheel, who Is a
symphony conductor of such magnitude
that he interprets all the masters with
unerring knowledge, is particularly strong
in his reading of Beethoven. Although we
have heard this grand work here before
by the same master conductor. It will be
a matter of extreme pleasure to once
more listen to Scheel's masterly reading.
It is customary to introduce and close
a symphony concert with an overture,
and this afternoon Scheel has chosen as
Introductory piece Hector. Berloiz's fas
cinating "Roman Carnival Overture." and
the concert will be worthily closed by the
Irresistible "Merry Wives of Windsor"
overture. Thus it will be seen that this
afternoon's concert presents a programme
of great artistic meritâ a programme
which a musician, music lover or student
cannot afford to miss because of its seri
ous character and Its new compositions,
which on this occasion "may be heard for
the first time In this city under very for
tunate conditions.

of his art is here in choice evidence, and
Mr. Davis owes much to Mr. Miller In
this impersonation. One cannot feel Miss

dish, though she is entirely charming.
She plays the good natured thespian,
however, very attractively, as she must,
with all her accustomed grace, finesse,
and skill, and returns to the brecks of
Lady Ursula very prettily in the last act.
Miss Waldron, who made so pleasing
Impression on her debut here last year,
shows marked advance in her work,
though her earlier efforts of the evening
were marred by an evident nervousness.
But she shows a notable spirit, sincer
ity and refinement in all she attempts,
and her Helen of last, night was admir
able from these standpoints. Her work
bears much better than that of most act
resses who appear with Miss Anglin, the
difficult juxtaposition with the finish, deli
cacy and superb, nervous strength of the
Anglin eauloment. Miss Waldron wore
some unusually pretty gowns, by the way,
and in the ballroom scene looked partic

comedy furnished evident entertainment
to the audience last night its amiable im
probabilities must be as generously taken.
The story concerns the adventures in Lon
don (and why London?) of a young Amer
ican playwright, in love with an Amer
ican heiress. Probably the story Is framed
In Its. London setting to give opportunity
for the opulently aristocratic cast in
which Mr. Davis indulges. Dukes are as
common as blackberries therein, and even
the manager who accepts the hero's play
is a modest "Sir." There Is a good
natured actress, Flora Cavendish (played
with good-humored Incredulity by Miss
Anglin), who interests herself in getting
the hero's play accepted and who in the
excitement of the acceptance throws her
arms around his neck and kisses him.
This little incident is naively misunder
stood by the heroine, who Immediately
thereupon pretends to accept the villain,
and afterward packs her trunks to go
home to New Tork. She doesn't go, how
ever, for Miss Cavendish' brings her back
triumphantly to the heart-broken play
wright.
But there are some novel and pretty
Incidents, some good lines and scenes in
the play that help to make an evening
pass pleasantly enough. In the last act,
where the performance of this "most
wonderful play in. London for five years"
âthe Eric .Temple opera fashionâ is sup
posed to be in progress, the little scene
becomes thoroughly interesting. The
leading lady has impossibly disappeared,
but the effect of her disappearance is very
happily painted, and tne incidents be
hind scenes are throughout humorously
and effectively sketched. But the, play,
as Mr. Miller says, will bore no one, and
will amuse and interest the larger mul
titude.

they were all there last night, prepared to

anything these favored folk had to offer.
Richard Harding Davis and "The Taming
of Helen" are both names attractive in
their promise. A story with the "Davis"
tag promises certain entertainment, his
earlier work. Indeed, presaged larger
things, yet unfulfilled. "The Taming of
Helen," too, Is a charming title, and, did
It belong to the play, a very expressive
one. But one asks why "The Tamlns of
Helen?" at the close of the comedy. Helen
has not been tamed. She was a very
good little girl to begin with, with Petru
chio's arts a distinct superfluity. The
lover, a high-minded person who writes
plays, and who does not mind how she
treats him personally so long as "she re
spects hi^ love." swears that he will not
again propose to her at her latest rejec
tion. The lady herself must "lay her
hand in his and say. 'I love you.' " This
she finally does, and this is all the out
ward and visible evidence of her taming.
She (Helen) isn't even as stubborn as
Geraldlne, and those expecting to revel in
the bltling of a Katherlne will look in
vain.

The matter has been reported to the po
lice and a careful watch will be kept to
prevent further attempts to fire HiM
building.
William Ackerman. ex-Superintendent of
Streets, the reputed owner of the lodging
house, denied last night that any attempt
had been made to fire his place, but never
theless he had a watchman patrolling the
premises during the entire night.
Another attempt was made yesterday
afternoon to set fire to the Fulton House,
a transient hotel at the corner of Fulton
and Larkln streets.
The house has two entrances, one on
Fulton street and another on Larkin
street. On Sunday afternoon shortly after
3 o'clock a fire was discovered in the Ful
ton-street entrance. The steps had been
saturated with coal oil and set on fire.
Luckily some one notified the housekeeper
and the flames were* extinguished. Two
hours later the stairs of the Larkln-street
entrance were found ablaze. The smell
of coal oil was noticeable about the house
and it was apparent that some miscreant
had made an attempt to fire the building.
Yesterday afternoon shortly after 2
o'clock the steps of the Larkin-street en
trance were again saturated with coal oil
and the fact that some burnt matches
were found lying about gave evidence
that anothet-attempt at incendiarism had
been made.

There will be no footlights, no visible or

requested not to applaud. The names of
the actors will not appear on the pro

play will be given out at the door on the
opening night.
Under the direction of Ben Greet of the
Elizabethan Stage Society of London this
year's revival of "Everyman" will be
richer In mediaeval atmosphere than that
of last year. Several innovations have
been made to give the performance an
even greater tone of the Dark Ages.
Offlcer J. N. Beach, who was detailed
by Chief of Police Wittman to the Board
of Public Works to take charge of the
work of removing the bootblack stands
from the public streets, reported yester
day that on Friday last he removed, with
the assistance of two men and a truck,
fourteen stands, and on Saturday twelve.
Officer Beach also reports that up to 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon he and his
assistants had removed twenty stands
from the corners of the principal streets.
In all cases the bootDlack stands where
the oerreit or license has fc explred will
be removed, except in the cases of nine
teen, which are being protected by a.re
straining order of the Supreme Court.* '
J. B. Lankershim and his attorney, Alex
Vogelsang, appeared before the board and
requested that a permit be eranted for
the reconstruction of the interior of the
Theater Republic building, formerly Met
ropolitan Temple, on Fifth street. L#an
kershlm informed the board that he did
not Intend to have a theater in the build
ing, but the board doubted its power to
grant the permit to reconstruct the in
terior at all. Vogelsang differed with this
view and screed to submit a brief show
ing that the permit should be granted.
Officer J. X* Beach was directed to no
tify all owners of bootblack stands main
tained on sidewalks of the terms of the
resolution and where the permits ipsued
by the board have been annulled to re
move the stands forthwith from the side
walk?.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
adopted a resolution revoking ail permits
heretofore granted to â¢ use the public
streets or sidewalks- for the purpose of
maintaining bootblack stands thereon in
all cases where the period of the license
has expired. Each permit running with

957 to 977 Market Street.The Board of Education created an alarming prece
dent for itself a few days ago when it refused to dis
miss a teacher from the department without cause.
The fact that the same teacher had once been dis
missed and returned by order of court with complete
back salary may have had something to do with the
board's refreshing exhibition of morality. Reforms
may be won slowly, but they arc won.
We refrain from the extensile comment that might
be made, but all who read the investigation will make
their own comment and reach the conclusion that
THE investigation of the escape at Folsom is
not good reading for Californians, nor is it
good reading for the State when put before
Eastern readers. It is not necessary to review the
details, the lack of. discipline, of nerve, of judgment
in emergency. They reveal a condition in that prison
that calls for action of the most drastic nature.
It is useless to talk about walls around a prison
where guards unlock gates at the command of des
perate convicts. Nor is it useful now to instruct
guards to fire on escapes, no matter whom they may
hit, after the neglect of that most primary necessity
has cost the Jives of so many people in the hills and
chaparral of El Dorado County. What is needed in
every prison is an officiary that knows it is enlisted
to kill and be killed in any form of emergency. The
desperate class among convicts are perfect judges of
human nature. They note the lack of nerve by a
thousand signs not seen by others. Rules and regu
lations are worthless unless put in the hands of men
to enforce who have courage, quickness and initia
tive. Every Californian knows that the Folsom af
fair could not have happened with General McComb
or Canjain Aull in charge. They were great prison
wardens, and, though they arc dead, there are men
left of the same quality.
THE FOLSOM INQUIRY.
The Czar of Russia has been accused of giving se
cret aid to the Macedonians in the hideous revolt
which is now raging in the Balkans. If the Czar of
Russia were guilty of every offense of which he is
charged he could claim 'absolute perfection in devil
try. As it is his name supplies suggestion to the
romancing pencils of the press correspondents.
IN the discussion of mobs and lynching by the Cen
tral Assembly of the Chautauqua, Mr. Graves of
Georgia justified lynching as punishment of the
crime unspeakable, and charged that crime in fre
quency elsewhere unheard of and unknown upon the
Southern negro. This charge has caused a resort to
statistics. In the whole United States there are
3,800,000 negro males over five years of age; In the
past twelve months thirty-eight negroes^ committed
this crime, for which thirty were lynched and eight
were legally executed. So that the ratio of the
crime is less than one to 100,000 of the colored males
in the whole country. In Chicago, in the same twelve
months, the same crime was committed by sixty
three white men, or at the ratio of one, assault to
each 12,000 white males over five years of age in
that city. These statistics are not quoted . in praise
of the abstention of negroes, but as an interesting
contribution to the discussion of race tendencies.
THE CRIME OP CRIMES.
Oakland has tried the intelligent experiment of re
ducing the number of pupils in each class of her pub
lic schools, thus giving to teachers greater opportuni
ties to devote their time to necessary individual in
struction. The result is that hundreds of non-resi
dents are seeking to send their children to the schools
in Oakland. A suggestion of imitation would proba
bly strike our Board of. Education as absurd.

Samuel "Wlllmott, aged 40 years, whose
residence was at 733 Guerrero street, died
suddenly yesterday an hour after betr.?
taken to the Central Emergency Hospital.
Willmott had been conducting a cigar
store at 219 Mason street and had Just
disposed of his business and made a final
settlement of his indebtedness when he
was stricken with an apoplectic fit en the
street. He was removed to the hospital,
but was beyond all medical aid. Deceased
had been Indisposed of late and had in
tended, visiting his father's country resi
dence in the hope of being restored to
health.
Citizen Dies Suddenly.
The whole country is interested in knowing
whether the ether States which have taken the ballot
from the negro propose also to take away his school
house.
Thoughtful people see the danger to any com
monwealth of having a vast majority of its people
deprived entirely of education. It is an element of
such danger that it furnishes an unanswerable argu
ment for the entire subjection of the proscribed class
to chattel slavery and to complete control by the
dominant race. In no other way can such an im
mense mass of ignorance be made safe for the State.
As involuntary servitude is forbidden by the Federal
constitution, it should be seen that safety lies in edu
cation and can be found in nothing else.
Therefore no excuse can be offered for Vardaman
that will he accepted by sensible men. But, as was to
have been expected, excuses are not lacking, and it is
surprising that the first one comes from as enlight
ened a source as the Atlanta Constitution. That paper
says that Mississippi gave Vardaman a plurality in re
taliation upon the President for forcing upon the peo
ple of Indianola a negro postmaster.
As we recall the facts in that matter they are these:.
The postofnee at Indianola had been held for fifteen
years &y an intelligent and well-behaved mulatto
woman, who had served under administrations of
both parties. The grade and salary of the office were
raised, so that it became a prize for white politicians,
and the postmistress was ordered to resign and
threatened with death by lynching if she did not. An
American should instantly appreciate that this Gov
ernment cannot, with self-respect, accept the resig-
Bation of its officers under such circumstances. The
President took the only possible course, and was im
mediately accused of "forcing a nigger" upon the
people of Indianola!
By this statement it will be seen that what the At
lanta Constitution means is that when the adminis
tration will not change a postmaster long in service
when the officer is threatened with murder the State
of Mississippi will resent his act by depriving a ma
jority of her people of education.
MISSISSIPPI has just had a primary election
to indicate the choice of the State for Gov
ernor sr.d United States Senators. As only
one political party is permitted to exist in that State
the contest was internecine. McLaurin and Money
C^ere indorsed for the Senate, but there was no major
ity for Governor, and therefore no choice, so that
there must be another poll for that office.
The candidates were Major Vardaman, Judge Critz
and Colonel Xoel. Vardaman led, partly because he
has shown his "blood"' by killing two men. but mainly
because he advocated allotment of the school fund
by races, giving it in proportion to the color of the
taxpayer instead of per capita to all children of school
age. The negroes in Mississippi outnumber the
whites by about 400,000. The new constitution effi
ciently disfranchises them, and Vardaman's plan closes
their schoolhouses and forbids their education. . His
campaign was very violent in outrageous abuse of
President Roosevelt and in his expressions of a sav
age purpose to "keep the nigger down." Both
Colonel Xoel and Judge Crist advocated allotment of
the school fund per capita, and as Noel drops out,
under the rules of ihc second poll, his vote will go to
the others. If it be cast for Judge Crist the school
fund will be properly distributed. Otherwise Varda
man's policy will prevail, and the world will be fur
nished a new illustration of a very old thing, that
men deprived of political power soon have all rights
taken awav from them.

boxes will be needed, and from 200 to S00
boxes is the quantity that each interested
party may supply, each collection to con

P&EPAIUNG TO EXHIBIT
FRUITS OP CALIFORNIA
â It will be readily perceived that neither Judge
Woodward nor Judge Lore stated the position of Jus
tice Brewer fairly. Brewer's plea is not for railroad
ing a suspected man to the gallows or to prison. It
is no more nor less than a plea that has been made
over and over again by earnest men seeking a rem
edy for the manifest evils of our system of criminal
prosecution. Lynch law is not the only evidence that
something is wrong with our legal machinery for the
prosecution and punishment of crime. The number of
murders committed in the United States is appalling
for a civilized country, and the percentage of offend
ers punished is much lower than it should be.
Clearly then there is something wrong. The public
has believed Brewer to be right,. but now that other
Judges rise to combat his doctrine an interesting sub
ject is open for controversy. Who shall decidewhen
Judges disagree?
JUSTICE BREVVER of the United States Su
preme Court has recently declared a conviction
that the law's delay is in some measure respon
sible for the prevalence of lynch law. He does not
even by implication offer an excuse or a palliation of
lynching, for he speaks of the offenses jaf the mobs
.as "atrocities," but after asking what can be done to
stay the evil he says: "One thing is the establishment
of a greater confidence in the summary and certain
punishment of the criminal. Men are afraid of the
law's delays and the uncertainty of its results. Not
that they doubt the integrity of the Judges, but they
know that the law abounds with technical rules, and
that appellate courts will often reverse a judgment of
conviction for a disregard of such rules, notwithstand
ing a full belief in the guilt of the accused. If all
were certain that the guilty, ones would be promptly
tried and punished the inducement to lynch would be
largely taken away."
The view thus stated coincides with public opinion,
and there has been a widespread commendation of
the position taken by Justice Brewer. Other Judges,
however, have hastened to assert an opposite doc
trine and to maintain that the law's delay has in no
degree rendered the people discontented with 'the
processes of the courtsâ at least not to such an extent
as to impel them to take the law into their own hands
and inflict punishment by lynching. Thus Judge
Woodward of New York stated in a Chautauqua ad
dress: "The technical rules which are made use of by
the guilty to delay the day of execution are the rules
which guarantee to the innocent the preservation of
their rights, even in the face of popular clamor.". He
went on to say that all attempts to determine the
efficiency of law by consideration of the amount of
time elapsing between the commission of the crime
and the final act of the jury is foolish.
A similar statement is reported from Justice Lore
of Delaware, who, also addressing the Chautauquans,
said: "Any court of justice that would listen to the
mob and Buffer it to prescribe its methods should be
abolished as a mockery of human justice. The more
brutal the crime, the more degraded the criminal, the
more widespread and intense the public outrage, the
more imperative it is that courts of justice should
give a caftn. just and fair hearing and that the guilt be
established, otherwise .men may be punished for a
crime they did not commit."

Special Correspondence to The Call.
The issue is one of moment to every industry of
our people, for farmers, iron miners, coal miners, lum
bermen, cattlemen, manufacturers and merchants
are all directly concerned in the foreign trade; of the
country, while workingmen of every class would be
benefited by the employment at home of the money
now expended in paying freights to foreign shipping.
It is time for public sentiment to declare itself on the
subject, for Congress is soon to assemble, and a reso
lute expression of a popular demand for the promo
tion of the American merchant marine would have
the effect of bringing about effective legislation be
fore the coming winter is over.
ACCORDING to "The Blue Book of American
Shipping," issued by the Marine- Review of
Cleveland, not a single contract has been let
for an American vessel to engage in foreign trade
during the past two years. The simple statement of
the fact should be sufficient to arouse popular inter
est in the subject, for there is surely something
wrong when a country like our own, whose foreign
commerce is enormous, makes no effort whatever to
provide ships for carrying it, but is content to leave
it in the hands of foreign ship-owners.
There are other facts equally startling in their reve
lations of our neglect of the ocean merchant marine.
A recent circular issued by the New York Board of
Trade and Transportation says: "It is a fact that the
United States of 1810, with seven million inhabitants,
owned more registered tonnage for oversea trade
than the United States of 1903, with a population of
eighty million. The tonnage in 1S10 was 981,000; it
is now 873.000, and, worse still, it showed an actual
decrease of six thousand tons from the year before.
In 1810 American ships and American sailors carried
91.5 per cent of their country's ocean trade, and,
moreover, a great share of that of Europe. In 1861,
though we had already lost our Atlantic steam lines
and our ship-building. was falling off, we still carried
65.2 per cent of our own trade and some of the trade
of other nations. American ships last year conveyed
only 8.8 per'cent of our imports and exports. Our
registered tonnage in 1861 stood at 2,406,000. It
stands now at 873,000. Two-thirds of our once great
and powerful deep sea fleet has vanished â and not one
new keel for a deep sea ship is being laid on either
our Atlantic or Pacific coastline."
While we are doing nothing, foreign ship-builders
and ship-owners are busy. A continuously increas
ing fleet of foreign vessels carries -our trade for us,
levying a tribute from every pound of freight, whether
of export or import. Careful calculations made by
various experts are to the effect that the tribute
amounts to fully $100,000,000 annually, and some
authorities make the estimates much higher. Were
the sums thus expended in paying freight and pas
senger rates to foreigners kept at home and employed
in promoting American shipyards and American
ships, there would be an enlarged demand for all
kinds of raw material used in ship-building and an
increased amount of work and wages available for
American labor. We would thus not only rid our
selves of the position of a tributary nation, but would
materially increase our domestic industries as well as
expanding our foreign trade.
A summary of the shipping statistics of the leading
nations of the world, compiled from official reports,
says: "The British empire has 14,800,000 tons of
merchant shipping; Germany, 2,960,000 tons; France,
1,480,000 tons; Norway, 1,660,000 tons; Italy, 1,180,
000 tons. By far the larger part of all these fleets is
engaged in ocean carrying. But the United States of
America, which produces far more merchandise and
now sends more abroad than any other nation, has
a fleet registered for deep sea commerce of only 873,
000 tons."
Not content with their present advantage on the
seas, foreign Governments are actively aiding their
great steamship companies in extending their lines
and increasing the number and the tonnage of their
vessels. Germany's policy in that respect is well
known, but of late Great Britain has been the most
conspicuous among the nations for liberality of gov
ernmental aid in the promotion of a national mer
chant marine. The subsidies just given to the Cunard
line show what Great Britain thinks of the value
of a merchant marine of her own, and the approval
with which the grant has been received by the pub
lic proves that the British people are as alert as the
Government itself to keep British commerce in Brit
ish ships instead of leaving it to pass into the hands
of foreigners.
American ship-owners could not successfully com
pete against foreign lines so largely subsidized by
their Government even if other conditions were equal,
but they are not equal. Our ship-owners have to
face not only the odds of governmental, subsidies,
but the further odds of low wages in foreign ship
building yards and on foreign ships. The difference in
wages itself amounts to a considerable handicap on
the American and goes far to account for the failure
of American enterprise to hold its own in the ocean
carrying trade of the world.

The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution appointing Super
visors Payot, Walsh (chairman of the

and Assessor Dodge a committee to ap
pear before the Board of Equalization at
Sacramento next Saturday to oppose the
proposed Increase in the assessment roll
of this city and county. The communi
cation from the Board of Equalization
that It intended to raise the roll and cit
ing the Board of Supervisors to show
cause why It should not be done was read
and the board decided to take active
steps to prevent such a course.
The ordinance giving notice of a special
election on September 29, 1903. when the
proposition to Issue bonds in the sum of
$18,135,000 for new sewers, schoolhouses,
hospital and other public improvements
will be submitted to the voters, was fin
ally passed. Braunhart stated that this
is the last step in the matter of bonding
the municipality for necessary improve
ments.
"The principal objection urged to the
remainder of the act Is, first, that It Is
special legislation. The act refers to the
use of these empty bottles by some one
other than the owner of the marks there
on after the original contents of the bot
tles have been taken out and then unlaw
fully trafficking in the empty bottles or re
tilling the same with other beverages.
Something was said in argument that bot
tlers of perfumery, etc.. could not take
advantage of the act. You never heard
of a manufacturer trying to get back bot
tles of perfumery after their having been
emptied. But it is customary that the
bottles containing beverages are to be re
turned to their owners to again be refilled
and sent forth and again gathered up and
returned,' etc.. and in view of the facility
with which these bottles after their con
tents have been emptied may be appro
prlated'by others than the owners there
of, the Legislature may have considered
the bottlers a separate and distinctive
class large enough In justifying them in
making legislation to protect them, and I
do not think I would be Justified In hold
ing that this act Is special legislation in
the meaning of the constitution. And as
to the other objection that the subject Is
not expressed in the title I am also In
clined to. hold that this Is not Eubject to
the objection stated."
The only doubt expressed by Judge Sea
well was as to whether the particular af
fidavit in the. Rosenberg case was made
full enough In its statements of fact, and
upon this point he Indicated a willingness
to hear further argument. But the suf
ficiency of that affidavit Is not important,
inasmuch as a new affidavit and warrant
may now be availed of under Judge Sea
we.il'B opinion sustaining the validity of
the legislation.
"I am of the opinion that section 4 of
that act, so far as it authorizes a search
warrant to issue upon mere information
and belief is in violation of consti
tution of this State, inasmuch as no prob
able cause Is shown for the issuance of
these warrants, but to hold that this sec
tion is void does not affect the balance of
the act nor does it necessarily dispose of
this case. Section Ip24, subdivision 4, of
the Penal Code contains also a provision
which authorizes the issuance of search
warrants in a case of this kind. That sec
tion provides that when the property is a
bottle bearing the duly filed trademark or
name of the person in whose behalf the
search warrant is applied for, is in the
possession of any person except the owner
thereof, with the intent to sell or traffic
or refill the same with the intent to de
fraud the owner thereof, it may be taken
on a search warrant from such person,
etc."
Now there is a marked difference be
tween these sections, the latter not being
subject to the objectionable features con
tained in the former:
"The proceeding which is sought to be
prohibited purports to have been insti
tuted under the act of 1S91, which was
passed for the protection of owners Of
bottles, etc.
By it you will notice that the act to
protect bottlers of beverages has not been
declared unconstitutional as reported, and
that while his Honor held section 4. rela
tive to' the issuance of search warrants on
simple Information and belief was In
valid, he went on to state that this did
not affect the balance of the act and fur
ther that the bottlers had a remedy for
this defective clause in the general search
warrant laws of the State as contained in
the Penal Code.
The following Is the decision of his
Honor in brief:
Owing to an erroneous statement pub
lished in The Call under date of August
16, entitled "Junk Dealers Win," and to
further editorial comments in some of the
dally papers which indicate that a wrong
impression has been formed as to the de
cision of Judge Seawell in this case, we

I have answered all these questions because
they Interest the water rate payers, but I
submit that the majority of those questions
do not In any manner affect the interests of
the municipal corporation and should not prop
erly be submitted to the City Attorney.
Regarding the, existence of a public
highway, called Troy place, within flfty
vara- lot No. 1403, Lane advises th'at no
such highway is shown on any of the of
ficial maps and it does not appear from
the abstract of title that the street was
ever dedicated to the public by the owner
thereof.
The money collected by the company In ex
cess of the rate fixed by the board Â«roes into
its treasury, but a bond of $135,000 has been
given to insure the return of any excess so
paid.
The injunction will not In any manner pre
vent the city from acquiring the municipal
water system which the board has already
taken stecs to secure from a source in the
Sierras.
I know of no law requiring the water com
pany to furnish water free of chan~. If the
rate collected is higher than that of 1002 the
company commits a breach of the stipulation
made with the court, upon the strength of
which. In part, the temporary Injunction was
granted.
Tbe water company has no right under the
injunction to demand from thÂ« consumers any
amount In excess of the rate fixed by the
Board of Supervisors. The court has held that
the rate of 1903 is invalid because unreason
able. It must be treated for the time being
as entirely unenforceable.
The company may properly give a receipt
to consumers that the money In oaymÂ«nt is
received subject to the ultimate decision of
the courts as to the validity of the rate of
1008.
City Attorney Lane sent a communica
tion yesterday to the Board of Super
visors In which he replie3 to a number
of questions relating to the present liti
gation Aver water rates of 1903 instituted
in the United States Circuit Court by the
Spring Valley .Water Company. Lane
makes the announcement that in his opin
ion there are no water rates now legally
in force In this city and county. In his
opinion Lane says:
The constitutional provision on the subject
declares that a water rate ordinance put into
effect upon July 1 should continue In force
for "one year and no longer. " The water
rate ordinance of 1002 is .therefore rot now in
force. As to what water rate should be col
lected pending litigation the Circuit Court
made no order or rulinr. Counsel for the
Spring Valley company made the otter in court
to accept the rate fixed in 1902 until the
validity of the 1003 rate was finally determined.
There is no record as to the Drocedure In
the collection of water rates from consumers
in a former case of this kind, namely that
arising out of the rate fixed in 1880, which
was determined adversely to the city, but I
am Informed that the procedure was. the same
aa that now adopted by the water company â
to collect the rate fixed by the previous year.
The injunction does not authorize the col
lection of any water rates: It enjoins the col
lection of water rates under the ordinance of
1003.
The Justinian Caire Company denied
having given a cent, though the firm's
name was down as having contributed $10.
The whole matter, with documentary
evidence, has been turned over to the
police, who are making a thorough in
vestigation and hope to soon have the
men in custody.
The Weinstock-Lubln Company handed
"Eaton" over $5 without a .murmur.
Cashier W. A. Remensberger of the En
terprise Brewery handed his callers the
sum of $10 and . received a receipt from
the man who called himself and signed
himself "J. Eaton."
Fred J. Halton, general auditor of the
United Brotherhood of Railway Employes,
also denied knowing anything of the men.
R. B. Hale of Hale Bros, admitted that
the men called for subscriptions. Not hav
ing complied with the request for a do
nation. -iale pronounced the placing of
his name to the list for the sum of $15
as a forgery. â¢
When Hale's superintendent, F. H. Wa
ter, scanned the documents he grew
doubtful and told the men he would make
inquiries before advising a donation.
Andrew M. Davis, secretary of the Em
porium, was one of the other citizens ap
plied to, but his suspicions were aroused
as sconSas he scanned the list, and con
sequently begged his callers to allow him
time to make some investigation before
contributing.
The plea for subscriptions purporting to
come from the Order of. Railway Conduc
tors and bearing the official seal of the
order, which must have been fraudulently
appropriated, concludes with the follow
ing peroration:
Hoping to obtain the a*slstancÂ« of all free
hearted and charitable persons we would ask
their assistance in this undertaking. This
is the only authorized list and has the in
dorsement of the brotherhood. The bÂ«arers
will rive any Information required.
The subscription list shows that the
Order of Railway Conductors gave the
munificent Bum of $500, while the Switch
men's Union of North America was
down with the equally handsome donation
of $500.
Merchants follow with donations in
sums varying from $5 to $15. The amount
supposed to have been realized, including
the donations of the two organizations,
footed up to $11R5.
Thomas Billlngslea, secretary of Divi
sion 115 of the Order of Railway Conduc
tors, when seen yesterday characterized
the "collectors" as swindlers. He said
that the whole thing was an Impudent
fraud, and that so far the order of which
he is* an official had been able to care
for all dependent upon it. He further
stated that it is not the custom of the
order to apply for benefits from merchants
or others, and that no such names as
Joseph Eaton or John Mitchell appeared
on the books of the orcanlzation.
MERCHANTS SUSPICIOUS.
By P. O. LONG, Secretary.

By H. T. SOHMES. Secretary.
(Seal) Order of Railway Conductors, office
secretary and treasurer.
To whom It may concern: This is to cer
tify that the bearers. Conductor Joseph Eaton
and Brakeman John Mitchell, are authorized
by the undersigned organization to solicit sub
scriptions on list hereto attached, which is
circulated jointly by the Order of Railway Con
ductors and Switchmen's Union of North
America. i
ORDER OF RAILWAY CONDUCTORS.
Very Ehortly after the man had gone
the detective arrived, but too late to be
of any service.
The following is the document by which
the men have been enabled to get sub
scriptions,, though in numerous Instances
they were foiled in their purpose:
FRAUDULENT CREDENTIALS.
Order of Railway Conductors. O. R. C,
Pacific Jurisdiction.
SAN FRANCISCO, Aui. 7. 1003.
The man must have seen Dohrmann at
the telephone and, becoming fearful that
something was about to happen, made a
hasty retreat and was soon lost in the
crowd on the street.
Xo one authorized to solicit for any person
â¢whatever by the order of the Railway Con
ductors; cannot epeak for the other railway
organizations; can gay positively it is not their
manner of handlins their cases of charity.
The thins smacks etronKly of fraud.
On Saturday Dohrmann was interrupt
ed by being called from his desk by a
tall, sturdy, highly flushed looking indi
vidual, who apprised the merchant that
he had called for his subscription. Dohr
mann says that he was not either of the
men who first called upon him.
The man was bland and expectant and
showed Dohrmann the "list of subscrib
ers" and placed in his hands the "official
credentials" which authorized the collec
tion.
Dohrmann was anxious to read the doc
uments and requested to be allowed to
have them copied and, going out of the
office, paesed the papers to his typewriter
to have a copy made.
Dohrmann also went to the telephone
and called up Captain Wittman with the
request that he send a detective at once.
DECLARED TO BE SWINDLE.
With the merchant's determination im
pressed upon them, the two young men
retired and In the meantime Dohrmann
made inquiries with the result that the
Associated Charities instituted an inves
tigation that resulted in the receipt of the
following telegram dated Thursday, Au
gust 20, from W. H. Sheasby, secretary of
the Order of Railway Conductors, Fresno:
Their representations were backed by
imposing documents, signed and duly and
elaborately sealed and alleged to have
been issued by the order.
Dohrmann did not altogether like the
proposition.
It looked to him to be a shady plea, al
though there was a formidable array of
the most representative merchants al
ready down on the list of charitable sub
scribers that the committee from the "Or
der of Railway Conductors" flashed be
fore the merchant's eyes. Notwithstand
ing these signatures Dohrmann still re
'malned of the opinion that the thing
ought to be investigated.
A casb of one of the most impudent im
positions practiced in the city for some
time has been exposed by Frederick W.
Dohrmann of the Nathan-Dohrmann
Company. A week ago two men called
on Dohrmann. representing themselves to
be railroad employes. They gave their
names as Conductor Joseph Eaton and
Brakeman John Mitchell, telling: the mer
chants on, whom they called that they
were authorized by the Order of Railway
Conductors to collect subscriptions to
swell a fund for the family of an ex
conductor named James Carr, who, they
stated, had lost both of his legs through
a railway accident.
Mr. Burns' friends, of whom he has
many, are flocking to the sub-treasury of
fice to offer their sympathy and encour
agement in the trying ordeal. He has
been presented already with six pairs of
foot warmers and four hot water bottles.
The world has a cold and icy outlook
to Thomas P. Burns, United States As
sistant Treasurer at this port. He dreams
of dull green glaciers and towering Ice
bergs covered with snow, and awakens
with the cold perspiration rolling off his
body like hailstones.
All his tribulation is due to the fact that
he has received a subpena, to appear as
a witness at the trial of Forger Beaseley
in Nome, Alaska. The steamer that will
take him to the Arctic, will ar
rive at Nome on September L The last
boat leaving Nome will sail on September
7. If the trial of Beaseley should not
be concluded' by the latter date Mr. Burns
will be obliged to remain in Nome until
next April with nothing to do but skate
around on snow phoes and eat salt pork
and beans and think of the nice hot birds
going to waste in San Francisco, with
his salary going on as regularly as clock
work.

Denies Story of Food Shortage.
SEATTLE. Wash.. Aug. 24.â That there
is and has been no food shortage In the
new Tanana diggings since the opening
of navigation may^be stated upon the
authority of Harry Tregasakls. a resident
of this city. Two river steamers each
laden with supplies, reached Fairbanks
and Chenoa, the two towns of the cairm
prior to June 11. Subsequent to that date
at least two other steamers with full car
goes of provisions and miners' supplies
had made Fairbanks. That there was
even hunger, much less starvation. In the
Tanana camp up to June 11. Tregasakls
says, Is preposterous.

Lou Dillon is a dark chetnut mare. She
Â» very symmetrical, but somewhat small,
he wears six-ounce shoes and light quar
er boots forward, three-ounce shoes be-
Sanders had great success on the grand 1
circuit last year with Anzella, whom he
gave a mark of 2:0614, Dollie Dillon 2:07
and Janice 2:08^. The former mare came
dangerously close to sweeping the board.
"Lou Dillon was a high-strung mare and
it required much patience and skill to
handle her. Sanders always evinced the
greatest confidence in Lou Dillon, but,
his contentions were ridiculed by many of
the trainers at Pleasanton. Sanders
adopted a novel method of training the
mare. He would blanket her and then
let one of his boys Jog he^ half a dozen
miles along the county road's. This treat
ment worked wonders and the mare even
tually became very tractable."
BOUGHT FOR $12,700.
I.ou Dillon is owned by C. K. Billings,
who bought her June 22 last at the Pierce
dispersal sale for the sum of $12,700.
Mr. Pierce himself had set her value
at more than $100,000.
Billings bought the mare partly for sen
timent, as she was the great-granddaugh
ter of the famous old Princess, which
Billings' father had owned in 1857.
A gentleman of this city of much ex
perience In the matter of trotting horses,
'etc.. Is well acquainted with Lou Dillon
and also her trainer, to whom he is In
clined to ascribe the credit for developing
the wonderful powers, of the mare. He
said a short time since:
A HIGH-STRUNG MAiRE.
ished the American public by trotting a
mile in 1859 in 2:19%. Goldsmith Maid in
1S67 trotted a mile in 2:14. Maud S made
her record of 2:08?* In 1880 and/ reigned
queen for eleven years.
Taking into consideration that Lou Dil
lon ls> only> 5 years old an*l that she start
ed the present season Â¦with no mark, it
must be admitted that she is the most
likely two-minute' trotter in the world.
The closest match was that between Dr.

Club and A. H. Braly of the Los Angeles
Country Club, which was won, "1 up, at

who Is under enffapement to ride August
Belroont's race horses fcr the remainder
of the season, was siirpended to-day after
the Eixth race by the stewards of the
meetinp. headed by William C. Whitney.
The cause of the punishment was the
charge that liullman, on Choate, whose
post rcsit'on was No. 10 on the outside,
cut over to the inside when the barrier
was released. All the other starters were
thus more or less interfered with, notably
Dark Planet, who was pulled to a stand
still by Martin, because he feared that his
horse would be thrown down. The sus
pension is for the rest of the Saratoga
meeting Bullman can ride in the Futur-.
ity. \
The race was won by Congressman Tim
Sullivan's Earnest 1'arham. ridden by Ful
ler, who thus rode his third winner to
day. His other winning mounts were Ha

I The Hayes Valley Athletic Club man
agement Is jubilant over a dispatch It re
ceived from Benny Yanger. the Chicago
boxer, who sent word that he would come
out here to fight Eddie Hanlon next
month. YangeT will start in a few days
for this city and will go Into training at
, once for the contest. The last time the pair
j met the referee called It a draw. Hanlon
, wanted another chance at Yanger and the
little Italian consented. Their second
meeting should prove an interesting one.
The Olympic Athletic Club will hold a
boxing exhibition the latter part of next
month. Leader John J. Gleason will
match the best amateur talent in the city.
He hopes to secure Sam Berger's rein
statement in the amateur ranks. When
Berger went out on the road with Bob
Fitzslmrnons as his sparring partner he
secured permission from the Amateur
Athletic Association of 'this coast. Upon
his return to this city Berger was sur
prised to learn that Secretary James E.
Sullivan of the National Amateur Athletic
Association had declared him a profes
sional. Berger has appealed to the di
rectors of thfe Olympic Club to take up
his case. Since acting 1 as sparring part
ner with Jim Corbett the young Olympic
Club boxer has gained a world of expe
rience. He is bigger and stronger, and
Dewitt Van Court and other experts
prophesy that he v.ill some day be cham
pion of the world. If Berger Is reinstated
he will be matched against Andy Gal
lagher or some equally good heavy-weight.
Fists will fly at the Reliance Athletic
Club to-nl?ht. Toby Irwin and Bi'.ly Otta
will be the stars, and hundreds of local
ring-goers will journey to Oakland on the
7:C0 p. m. narrow gauge boat to se*e the
mill. Both men will weigh In at Harry
Corbett's at 3 o'clock to-day. They are to
battle at 125 pounds and the victor Is
promised a go with Jimmy Britt. This
will be the first exhibition held In Oakland
for more than a year. Manager Mahoney
has prepared two good preliminaries. One
will be between Fred Otts, a brother of
Billy, and Danny Sullivan. These youths
will fight at 130 pounds. They will go
eight rounds. The opening bout will be
put on at 8:30 o'clock sharp. It will be
between Jim Smith and Young McConnell.
They will box six rounds. Eddie Smith
will referee all bouts.

On the slopes of the Ural Mountains
and in Brazil, California, Australia, Can
ada and many other , countries, says
Chambers' Journal, a peculiar substance
known as native platinum is found. This
is an alloy of ( the metals platinum, palla
dium, Ididium, osmium, rhodium and ru
thenium, together with a little gold and
Iron. All of these except the last men
tioned are the, "noble" metals. They do
not tarnish in .the air and are not coluble
in any single acid. Their values per ounce
are: Platinum, 95s; palladium, 190s; os
mium, 220s; iridium, 230s; rhodium, 400s;
and ruthenium, 450s. The most plentiful
metal occurring is native platinum Is that
from which it takes Its name. This metal
Is of a grayish color and, with one ex
ception, is the heaviest substance known.
Its fusing point is extremely high, and
this property, together with its freedom
from tarnishing, causes it to be largely
used for the manufacture of crucibles and
other vessels required by scientists to'
stand a very high temperature. It is also
sometimes used as a substitute for gold
in photography, and when deposited in
a thin film on t-e interior of the. tubes
of telescopes It forms a dead black sur
face, which prevents the light from be
ing reflected by the polished sides. The
demand for platinum largely exceeds the
supply; hence the metal is yearly advane
lng in price.
Palladium Is of the lustrous white color.
It is the most easily fused of the metals
found in platinum ore and can even be
votallized. A curious quality -which thl*
metal possesses is that when heated to red
ness It Is porous. to hydrogen sraa, allow
ing it to pass through somewhat in tho
same maner that blotting paper permits
the passage of water. The ullvory white
color of palladium and ita freedom from
tarnishing renders it useful for making
scales and division. marks on scientific In
struments. A mixture of this metal with
mercury is sometimes used for stopping
teeth. Osmium is a metal which pos
sesses two remarkable propertiesâ it Is
the most refractory of the metals, resist
ing fusion at the most intense heat, and
it Is also the heaviest substance known,
being almost twenty-two and a half
times heavier than water. Together with
lrldium, It occurs principally in a peculiar
variety of native platinum called osmlri
dium. This mineral differs from ordinary
platinum ore in that it contains a larger
proportion of osmium and iridium than
platinum. Osmlrldlum is found in small
particles, varying In weight from one
sixth to one-third of a grain. These par
ticles are extremely hard and are uÂ£ed
for pointing non-wearing pens. For this
purpose as much as thirty ounces of osml
rldium are usid annually In the United
States. This mineral Is a source of much
trouble to tho officials of tha Russian
mint, who find it extremely difficult to
separate small particles of it from the
gold used for coinage. â¢
Metallic Iridium possesses a white
steel-like appearance. The lenife edge3 of
delicate balances and other bearings
which require extreme hardness arc often
made of It. An alloy of 10 per cent irid
ium and SO per cent platinum has b?en
found to be very little aff6cteJ In volume
by changes of temperature, and is the
substance of which the standard meter,
kept in the international metric bureau at
Paris, is made. Rhodium and ruthenium
are metals of little practical use. The
former occurs In platinum ore to the ex
tent of 5 -to 6 per cent. The latter Is
found only In osmirmium, and averages
about 5 per cent of that mineral. Thes3
six metals have been treated together be
cause of their resemblance to each other,
but the metal which ranks next to plati
num In price is zirconium, which occurs
in hyacinth and some other rare minerals,
and is worth about Â£6 per ounce. Tita
nium and uranium, whose ores are found
In Cornwall and some other places, are
each worth Â£S 10s per ounce. Uranium is
remarkable for Its high atomic weight,
the heaviest known.â Baltimore Herald.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 24.-r<:ommercÂ«
between the United States and its non
contiguous territory amounted to more
than $100,000,000 In the fiscal year just
tended. Thla figure of $100,000,000 Include*
about $3,000,000 worth of gold bullion pro
duced in Alaska and brought Into the
United States. Even excluding this,
however, and including only merchandise
in the calculation, the total amounts to
$95^18,000..
This is the first opportunity which has
been offered for an accurate measure
ment and analysis of the commerce be
tween the United States and its non,-"'
contiguous territory since the annexation
of the Hawaiian Islands and Porto Rico.
The Hawaiian Islands were made a cus
toms district of the United States when
they were annexed, and as the law did
not require the collection of statistics of
commerce between the customs districts,
a part of the people engaged In that com
merce refused to supply such information
to the Bureau of Statistics. When Porto
Rico became a customs district of the
United States a similar condition devel
oped, except that the information was
voluntarily supplied for publication by
the steamship companies engaged In that
trade. As a result a special law was
enacted which applied to the commerce
between the various ports of the United
States and the non-contiguous territory,
the regulations which were applied to
foreign commerce, as far as relates to
statistics of such commerce. This la*t/>Â»*
went into effect at the beginning of the
last fiscal year, and therefore the result
of the fiscal year's operation Is just
available. The law, when enacted, was
made - broad enough to Include all non
contiguous territory belonging to the
United States. As a result it gives the
statistics of the commerce between Alas
ka and the ports of the United States,
as well as that of Hawaii. Porto Rico.
Philippines, Guam, the Samoan Islands,
etc. This record ha.3 been completed
for the fiscal year, under the new law,
and the result la indicated by the Depart
ment of Commerce and Labor through
Its Bureau of Statistics, as follows:
Shipments from the United States
to its non-contiguous territory,
1903 $36,722.JM1
Receipts of merchandise from non
contiguous territory. 1903 C8.894.71T
Gold bullion received from Alaska
(domestic production) 4,T19,5T9
Total $100,337,237
While these annual figures are the first
of any official nature which the country
has had of the commerce with Porto
Rico and the Hawaiian Islands since
their annexation, it Is practicable to
compare these with the figures of the
commerce with these islands in any year
prior to annexation because of the fact
that commerce with them was always
measured and reported when they were
foreign territory. Thla is true also with
the Philippines. In regard to Alaska no
accurate statistics of the commerce were
gathered prior to the last year, but esti
mates were made for former years, which
give a fair basis for comparison. It Is
practicable, then, to compare the com
merce of 1903 with that of 1S93, far all of
this territory which has now become a
part of the United States. This compart*
son shows that the imports from these
various territories aggregated. In round
' numbers, $29,000,000 in 1S93, and $39,000,000
in 1903. and that exports to that territory
amounted to less than $8,000,000 In 1S93,
and more than $36,000,000 In 1303.

The Protector differs chiefly from the
Holland and otner types of submarine
boats In being able to run along on wheels
upon the floor of the ocean. Traveling on
the bottom is declared to be the most
simple, safe and reliable method known
to under-water navigation. There are two
wheels fitted to the keelâ one in advance
of the otner. They are three feet In diam
eter, with nine-Inch face. .
The impossibility of stating in advance
what lands will ultimately be recommend
ed for reclamation will result in great
disappointment to many persons. The
fact that lands have been temporarily set
aside is, in the eyes of many, an Indica
tion that these lands will be reclaimed,
and, although every attempt has been
made to warn individuals of the futility
of filing upon these lands under the home
stead law, the^- persist In taking up the
land on the bare possibility that the sur
veys and examinations will ultimately
show it to be reclannable. It is an un
fortunate condition, which apparently can
not be corrected at present.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 24.â The first an
nual report of the reclamation service,
by F. H. Newell, chief engineer, which
will be published as a Congressional doc
ument, is about to be issued by the United
States Geological Survey.
In his letter of transmlttal the Direc
tor of the Survey notes that the recla
mation law of June 17. 1902, which Is
quoted In full, is so general in its terms
that its success or failure may be said
to rest almost wholly upon Its adminis
tration; Innumerable details not being
touched upon in the law.
The work of examination and survey
is described by- States. In most instances
the field work is still in progress and In
nearly every locality there are alterna
tive methods of reaching tne desired end,
the relative merits of which cannot be
determined until careful estimates have
been made. In brief, it may be stated
that work has been carried on In the
following localities in the variou3 States
and Territories: On Salt and Gila rivers
in Arizona: on . Colorado^River in Cali
fornia; on North Platte, Gunnison and
Grand rivers in Colorado; on Snake River
in Idaho; on the deep well problems of
Western Kansas: on Milk River in Mon
tana; on the artesian well probabilities of
Western Nebraska; on Carson and Truc
kee rivers in Nevada: on the artesian
probabilities of Central Oregon; on Bear
River in Utah; on Yakima River In Wash
ington; around Lake de Smet, and also
oh Sweetwater River in Wyoming.
At each of the places where systematic
work has been carried on preliminary,
temporary withdrawals of public lands
have been made, but the areas which may
be reclaimed are indicated only in a gen
eral way by these temporary segrega
tions. The final determination of the re
clamable area rests upon a summation
of all the facts of feasibility and cost, so
that it can be stated only as the last of
a series of estimates.
Efforts to reopen the Hermitage, one of
the old time roadhouses of Alameda Coun
ty, which flourished in Upper Fruitvale
before the advent of the electric roads in
that district, have failed. The applica
tion of F. C. Schnarr for a license to con
duct a saloon at that place was denied by
the Board of Supervisors this morning,
as Schnarr was unable to prove that
he had the proper signatures to his ap
plication.
Attorney Max Marcuse, who has been
representing Schnarr, said that he had
not heard from his client during the last
week, and therefore would not ask the
board for a continuance.
The fight against the resort has been
waged by residents of upper Fruitvale,
led by several clergymen, ever since the
place was closed by L#eon Faure two years
ago. The protestants have carried on a
protracted fight In an effort to perma
nently close the old resort.

for the protestants gave three reasons for
opposing the freight yards.
' First, because their establishment would
perpetuate the steam service, which he
considered out of date; secondly, the
yards would practically close streets in
the vicinity, and, third, they would depre
ciate the value of adjacent realty.

The Korea, which arrived yesterday, was the

the order to shape their course so as to be re
ported from Midway Island went Into effect.
She sighted Ocean and Midway Islands August
13 and exchanged signals with the cable sta

through the tall cf a cyclone on her home
ward voyage, but rough as the sea was It
affected the big liner no little that it was not

Among the Korea's passengers were
many people prominent in the social and
the commercial world. Among tho3e that
came from the C>rient were two captains
â¢well known In the Far Kast. Captain A.
E. Knights, superintendent of a liiij of
steamships on the Chinese coast, is here
on a business visit. Captain M. F. Pat
terson, who for fifty years has been mas
ter in the China coast trade, has retired
from the sea and has come home to spend
the rest of his days in Alameca.
The body of C. R. Lloyd, the Berkeley
millionaire, was brought home on the
Korea in charge of Mrs. Lloyd. Lloyd left
here on the Korea, intending to take the
round trip for the benefit of his neslih.
Though a sick man when he planed, fie
rapidly gained strength and at the time
of his death was apparently nnjoyinsr ro
bust health. He died on the trip from
Kobe to Yokohama. He had t'.tteiuled a
concert in the music room and when he
retired to his stateroom at about 1 a.
m. was in high spirits and seo:Â»innly good
health. He died half an hour late:" of
heart disease.
Eeneers. but less than 3000 tons of
freight. What her cargo lacked in dlrn.'n
elons, however. It made up in value. It
included nearly 1390 bales of raw silk, and
the value of this shipment is more than
$1,000,000. There was also stowed away In
her capacious holds 1S.99S chests of tea
and in her treasure room twenty-three
boxes of gold and silver specie consigned
to local banks. The Korea was twenty-
Fix days coming from Hongkong:, sixteen
days and ten hours from Yokohama and
live days seventeen and three-quarter
hours from Honolulu. She was not d'.ie,
according to schedule, until to-day, but
was expected here on Sunday afternoon.
She brought 156 cabin passengers, 51 In the
steerage and 200 " Asiatics. The exact
amount cf freight was 2790 tons.
The day after the Korea left Honolulu
a woman steerage passenger died and
a few minutes later another steer
age passenger grave birth to a girl
baby, so the liner landed here with
the number of passengers her papers
called for. Mrs. Copunti was the baby's
mother. Dr. Arbery, the liner's surgeon,
officiated at the arrival of the young lady,
who was given the name of the ship upon
which she was born. Captain Seabury
saw that everything possible was done
for the mother, who, with Miss Korea
Copunti, landed at this port in first-class
condition.

In the opening paragraph of the will
Helen E. . Cowell is appointed executrix
of the document. In the codicil anexecu
tor Is spoken of, thus showing t'he in
completeness of the will. Cowell's estate
is said to be worth almost Jl.000,000.
There are four Cowell children, namely
âHelen, Ernest, Samuel H. and Isabella.
The incomplete document places them In
a peculiar position in so far as their rights

The will of, Henry Cowell, the wealthy
lime dealer, was filed for probate yester
day. It Is a peculiar Cocument In that
it is evident y incomplete, containing noth
ing but the opening paragraph announc
ing that it Is the will of Cowell and a
codicil disposing of but a very small por
tion of his large estate. Two blank pages
are mute evidence that the deceased in
tended to make a disposition of his
wealth, but for some unknown reason
neglected to do so. His attorneys say
that the will was once complete, but
that the deceased, being dissatisfied with
some of its terms, had destroyed part of
it and substituted blank pages, intending
to fill them in at his leisure. The codicil
leaves to Alice George of Massachusetts,
a daughter of a friend, $4 a week until
she marries. It also provides that Ern
est V. Cowell, son of the deceased, shall
receive J1000 the first Christmas -following
the testator's death and $2000 on each suc
ceeding Christmas. It then provides that
the remainder of his estate shall go to
the Henry Cowell Lime and Cement Com
pany.

"The difficulty In last year's manage
ment was not one innate In the systemâ
the Inn can be run successfully on a co
operative basis. The trouble came when
the students who comprised the club met
and voted to reduce the price of board.
The price was set at a figure below cost.
Mr. Strowbridge will not be the receiver,
as stated in the Friday papers, but will
act in the capacity of steward, the posi
tion which he held last year."
The new order requiring monthly finan
cial reports from the different student or
ganizations will affect a large number of
them, including not only the Inn Club,
but also the Associated Students, class
organizations, literary organizations and
others which may incur debts and dis
burse funds.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Aug. 24-â
Hereafter all general student organiza
tions that have funds to be disbursed and
debts Incurred will be required to give
monthly reports to the faculty commit
tee on student affairs. This radical in
novation in the oversight of the affairs
of the students has been deemed neces
sary partly because of the failure of the
Stanford Inn Club to manage successfully
the running of the Stanford Inn last year.
President David Starr Jordan, when
seen to-day, said: "Every student organi
zation â open to the general admission of
studentsâ having the disbursement of
funds, must make a monthly report to
the committee on student affanrs."
This step has been taken in order to In
sure proper management of such organi
zations and protect their creditors. In
speaking of the situation at the Stanford
Inn. which has been placed In the hands
of receivers. Dr. Jordan said: "Our action
has been taken in order to protect tho
creditors of the Inn Club. I expect that
eventually the management of the inn
will be turned over to the students again.
This change from the receivership will be
effected whenever the creditors of the Inn
Club feel satisfied that the students can
meet their obligations. The reason that
the students ran so largely in debt last
year was that they were furnishing board
at a figure below cost. This mistake will
be obviated hereafter by the requirement
of a monthly financial report to be pre
sented to the faculty committee on stu
dents' affairs.

AFFAIRS OF STUDENTS
TO BE CLOSELY WATCHED
CHICAGO. Aug. 24. â Wet weather and
firmer cables were the early influences in the
wheat pit. There was an urgent demand at
the opening, which forced prices up from thÂ«
initial figures and they showed a gain of %@
4c to ug%c for September at sOViQSO^c,
and %@4c higher for December at Sl%@
81 4e. The advance was checked by selling,
due to increased receipts at Minneapolis, and
the market broke from 80 Ue for the former
and bl%c for the latter to i'J%c and 61c. The
offerings were well taken, and when the sell
ing ceased, strength again developed, and the
close was firm near the high point, September

WHEATâ Paris and Liverpool futures were
higher. The world's shipments for the week
were as follows, in quarters: Russian, 212,
000; Danubian 108.000; Argentine, 72,000; In
dian, 117.000. A Paris cable reported serious
damage in Franc* by rains, which caused an
advance in Paris.
The American visible supply Increased 252.000
bushels. Chicago was Â»;c higher and reported
the farmers disposed to hold for better prices.
Tture were 30 loads taken for export. St.
Louis reported that a marp cash demand
cleaned up all the wheat early In the day.
In this market futures were higher, but the
cash grain remained unchanged.*
Wires from â¢hlcago to Bolton. de Ruyter &
Co. said: -'It is a dull market, and this, af
ter the break of the past few days, would seem
to Indicate that pressing liquidation Is about
ever. At the close of last week the feeling
was bearish. Trade was disposed to Ignore all
other conditions and look for a rather free
movement of -wheat from the Northwest. To
day the outlook 1b considerably changed. The
Northwest has heavy rains. This Includes
Manitoba as well as the Dakotas. Engllen
country markets are quoted strong on scarcity
of offerings. A w,ell Informed authority gives
it as his cpinlon that the requirements of the
United Kingdom from the outside will thfs
year be the largest on record. It Is pretty
cenerally conceded that France will need to
rrport v'hrat. All th*.'e conditions mukÂ« us
feet t-utllah or. wheat. We mlKht add that pri
mary receipts continue materially liolow last
year." ' . .-

The fruit market had a healthier tone than
On Saturday, as stocks of poor fruit were con
siderably reduced and buying for shipping and
canning account was active. Choice wrapped
Peaches in small packages were wanted for
shipment and met with ready sale, while of
ferings in bulk moved off well under a good
demand from canners. Fine GrapÂ«s, wrapped
Bartlett Pears and fancy Plums were also in
demand for shipping and brought good prices,
but common and inferior stock continued to
sell at easy rates. Apples were abundant and
easy, there being vÂ«ry little Inquiry for ship
ping. The canners were still In the market for
Pears, and choice lots were quickly disposed of
at previous prices. Canning Plums wero
scarce, with prices largely nominal. Pome
granates were offering at 7553?5c per box with
few takers, and Quinces in small boxes sold
slowly at 75c per box. Supplies of Cantaloupes
and Nutmeg Melons were excessive and there
was a sharp drop In prices. A large portion of
the receipts of Cantaloupes were overripe and
several sales were reported below the quota
tions. . Watermelons were In ample supply and
moved freely at firmer rates. Receipts of Ber
ries were light and only strictly choice ofter-
Idkb showed any firmness. Prices of Citrus
and Tropical fruits were unchanged. Lemons
and Limes were, quoted steaay, owing to the
warm weather and a limited Inquiry for ship
ping. Oranges were In ample supply and dull.
Stocks of rlr>e Bananas were still light. Two
cars of the Central American article were rf 1 
ported close at hand anj will probably be mar
keted to-day.

Â¦ Butter was variously quoted weak, steady
or firm, according to the supply the dealer had
on hand. After the receipts .printed below
were compiled several steamers came in witta
liberal lines, so there was no scarcity. The
general feeling, however, taking the whole

all dealers are carrying sample stocks, though
the market shows no weakness.

There is room at the top. It has often bun said,
ThouRh the hill of success Is a hard one to climb,
For the atones in the way are a subject of dread
And may give one hard knocks perhaps many a time.
If the hill you would climb of a business career
You will need all the help of publicity wide;
That The Call nils thÂ© bill may be said without fear,
For our ads bring reeultsâ that'a our pleasure and pride.

The case of the United States against
William and John Rushing on a charge
of cutting timber on Government land was
dismissed yesterday irÂ» the United States
District Court on motion of United Statc3
District Attorney Marshall B. Woodworth.
The reason assigned for the dismissal waa
that the defendants gave valuable evi
dence in favor of the Government in the
Â«-ivil suit brought by the United States
against them and Alfred Hiatt for the re
covery of damages for the value of the
timber cut by them. In that suit judg
ment was rendered in favor of the Gov
ernment in the sum of $1700, which
amount Hiatt paid into court.
Timber Cutters Released.
Warehouse Demurrer Overruled.
Judge Beatty In tho United States Cir
cuit Court yesterday overruled the de
murrer In the cases ot the American Na
tional Bank of San Francisco against
Henry Wad* worth as receiver of the Pa
cific Warehouse Company, and the Na
tional Bank of Monterey against tho
same, and the cases will go to trial.
The Board of Education decided yester
day to appoint at once the last ten teach
ers remaining on the eligible list of thirty
who stood highest In the recent competi
tive examination to the substitute list of
the Public School Department,
It was at first thought necessary to ap
point only five, but as several vacancies
have occurred by resignation of teachers
the board found it Imperative to select
ten. This will exhaust the eligible list
of thirty and the board will be shortly
compelled to draw on the list of teachers
.who stood next in order in the examina
tion. President Woodward Is of the opin
ion that this will not be necessary until
next January. The ten teachers who will
be put upon the substitute list at onca
are; James Qavin Telfer, Mabel O. Ben
jamin. Josephine M. Hopkins. Marie d'Er
lich, Joanna M. Mullens, Josephine White.
Alice Louise Marsh. Mary Cahlll^ Caro
lyn E. Hortop and Kathryn Parker.
The ten eligibles who may hope for ap
pointment Into the department at least
by next January are: Gertrude R. Nor
ton. Katharine T. Moore, J. A. Imrie,
Bertha Klaus. Evangeline Adams. Nellie
T. O'Connor, Robert A. Lee, Annie King,
Edith M. Lapham and Agnes K. Fahey.
President Woodward is authority for
the statement that the board does not
contemplate the holding of another com
petitive examinaion for positions in the
department for at least two years. With
the appointment of the ten teachers
named the department will be well sup
plied with instructors and there Is still
a list to draw on of more than $ hun
dred teacher* who were successful at the
last examination bat were not high enough
in percentage to be placed on the first
list of thirty ellglbles, all of whom have
now been placed in the department, many
of them with permanent classes.
Mr. Vivanti Is considered the greatest
authority on the silk industry In this
country and he has read papers on this
subject before many of the commercial
bodies of the Eastern States.
The reeling off of the silk can only be done
by women â and these women must have- very
light hands and it takes years of experience
before they become thoroughly competent. The
only women who have lone. light hands with
tapering fingers are Japanese, Chinese and Ital
ian women. Colored women would be unable
to do thts reeling because their hands would
be much too heavy. For men to do this work
is out of the question.
These Japanese. Chinese and Italian women
reel the silk from the cocoons In a steam room
from twelve to fourteen hours a day for 23
cents. Although this 1% most skilled labor It
Is a peculiar thins that the women get a mere
pittance for their work. Negro men or wo
men down South would iwt work for 23 cents
a day and so they would be unable to compete
with either the Japanese, Chinese or Italian
silk producers.
Mr. Vivanti. in discussing the subject
yesterday, advanced many arguments
supporting his contention that the silk
raising industry cannot be a success in
America. He said:
I learned the industry of producing silk In
Italy when I was a boy. There are only four
countries where silk can be produced at a profit,
and those are Italy, France, China and Japan.
It has been tried In Australia, Ceylon and even
California, and In all these cases it was found
that It was a matter of no difficulty to raise
the worms and even get cocoons, _ but when it
came to reeling- the silk off failure resulted. In
California they had an experienced Italian to
look after the silk worm farm, but It was a
failure. \ .
. Among the arrivals at the. Palace yes
terday from the Orient Is Frank A. Vi
vanti-of New; York, one of the largest
raw silk importers In the world. He ridi
cules the idea of Secretary Wilson of the
Agricultural Department that the silk in
dustry can be profitably prosecuted by
the colored people of the Southern States,
and says that the whole plan is imprac
ticable.'
Secretary Wilson recently sent out com
munications all over the United States
explaining that the department at Wash
ington, would furnish any one desirous of
entering into the silk raising industry silk
worm eggs and young mulberry trees.
Two experienced French operators of reel
ing machines were brought to Washing
ton to teach the operation of these ma
chines.

A. Vivanti.

ordered his answer stricken from the rec

a verdict for the plaintiff, with costs.
Otis and Walls are stockbrokers. In
December, 1896. Walls gave Otis a promis
sory note for $1077 75, which was to bear
interest at 7 per cent. Nothing was paid
in the shape of interest or to reduce the
principal, and on November 28. 1900, Walls
wrote an Indorsement on the back of the
note promising to pay the principal and
interest within sixty days. Repeated de
mands were made upon Walls to fulfill
hi3 promise, but without success, and suit
was entered to recover the amount of
the note and interest from December, 1S96.

owned by the company. A form of ordi
nance, embodying the usual conditions
and describing the desired franchise ex

tion was referred -to the Street Commit
tee for investigation and report. The
franchise is Intended to permit of the
connecting of the terminals already pur
chased by the company in the Potrero
with the oil tanks in the vicinity of Sev
enth and Hubbell . streets. The proposed
ordinance lollows:
They will estimate upon the Giant Pow
der Company along with the others, and
if the price to be fixed seems adequate to
the directors of the Giant Company, so
said a prominent official of that corpora
tion last evening, the directors will prob
ably recommend to the stockholders that
their stock be placed in escrow, as the
preliminary step for forming the proposed
combine with millions of capital.
On authority this was denied, but it was
admitted that a. combination may be made
to include all the powder. making compa
nies on this coast if certain conditions
are complied with that will prove to be
satisfactory to the directors and stock
holders of the Giant Powder Company.
All the other powder companies have
practically given their approval to a plan
for combination that was broached some
time ago by. Mr. Dupont, who came from
the East to arrange the preliminaries.
The principal point that seems to con
cern the Giant Powder people is the price
to be placed upon its properties. Wh'en
negotiations were progressing some
months ago the' Giant Powder people were
not prepared to act. It has now been ar
ranged that appraisers shall come to the
Pacific Coast some time in September, for
the purpose of . estimating, the value of
the several powder companies' properties.
A rumor was on the street yesterday
that the Giant Powder Company had
finally agreed to join in a combine with
the other manufacturers of explosives on
the Pacific Coast.

Dr. Marquis resigned the position of
chief surgeon of the French Hospital two
weeks ago, and the nurses keenly feel his
departure. ,
The gift was to have been presented to
the popular physician in the library of the
French Hospital, but Superintendent
Miquiu, who has shown a strong feeling
of aversion to the doctor, declined to per
mit the use of the room. He suggested,
however, that the nurses might use the
dinln'g-room for the purpose, but the
spokeswoman replied that the dining-room
was for eating in and not for presenta
tions. Upon reporting back to her fellow
nurses . it was decided that those who
were off duty should call upon Dr.. Mar
quis and express their regard for him.
Twenty-five nurses gathered In the doc
tor's parlor and the handsome cup was
placed In the center of the circle.
Miss P. McCurdy, chief of the operating
room, stepped forward when the doctor
entered the room and on behalf of the
nurses of the French Hospital said: "Doc-,
tor, the nurses of the French Hospital
present you with this loving-cup as a re
membrance of the love and respect they
have for you and as a slight recompense
for the many kindnesses you have shown
us."
Twenty-five trained nurses of the French
Hospital called upon Dr. F. P. Canac
Marquis at his residence, 1101 Van Ness
avenue, last evening and on behalf of all
the nurses of the Institution presented him
with a handsome silver loving-cup as a
mark of the esteem in which they hold
him. Dr. Marquis was overwhelmed and
could hardly express his gratitude. The
present, coming as it did from the young 1
women who have labored with him in the
care of the sick and at a time when his
relations with the management of the
hospital are strained, was a great sur
prise.

Take awav from Golden Gate Park its
daily and holiday attendance of equip
ages ?nd one of its greatest beauties s.i;d
most ititerestinff features will !>e miss
ing. Love of good horses is a natural
irait in men and women. The number
and class of equipages is a good index
of the wealth and culture of a city. Pub
lic bodies should do everything in their
power to encourage the possession of su
perior horses bv the inhabitants. Driv
ing is a healthful and manly pasf'me and
a i ublic cround like Golden Ga'; Pa'k
should iifford from Its abundant means
every facility for the exercise of It.
A little thought on the part of the Com
missioners will likely lead them to "the
conclusion that five men of wealth can
better employ the time consumed in their
meetings in devising means for rehabili
tating the speedway than In discussing
the overwhelming question as to whether
Commissioner Aitman's leg was inside or
outside the door when the roll was called.
A proposalhas been advanced for the
construction of a three-quarter-mile cir
cular speedway which will take in a part
of the present abandoned straightaway
course. This proposal carries with it the
provision that the expenses for construct
ing the new track shall be raised by pop
ular subscription, as was done with the
old speedway. On the Inside of the in
closure is to be a field for polo playing
and similar sports.
In view of the present condition of the
speedway It is likely that road drivers
will, consider any proposition for a new
speedway on the terms advanced as mere
ly throwing good money after bad. The
indifference of the Park Commissioners
to the welfare of the old Epeedway, not
withstanding that they accepted It under
the condition that they would keep it in
full repair, is a poor guarantee that any
better spirit will be shown toward the
proposed new course.
The Park Commissioners are spending
money lavishly in betterments. They
have gone in strongly for the water cure.
They have built chains of lakesâ Hobo
Lake and Stowe Lake â and now they pro
pose to expend $50,000 over near the buf
falo sark for a lake to be used exclu
sively by children on which to sail toy
yachts. Another bunch of money, con
cerning the exact amount of which the
Commissioners call each other hard namci
ot nearly every meeting, was put into the
construction of a Dutch windmill.
SHOULD CONSIDER DRIVERS.
All of these things are good. Children
should have a place on which to sail their
toy : achts: those fond of aquatic spirts
should have lakes on which to row; the
Commissioners should have their Dutch
windmill if ther want it, but men and
horses should be given some little meed
of consideration in this beautiful public
resoi t.
Christopher W. Smith of Redington &
Co., who was one of the original sub
scribers to the speedway fund, said yes
terday: "In its present condition it is un
safe to drive a horse at a fast gait over
the speedway. I never use it any more.
A couple of months ago I sent' a horse
belonging to my wife over it and it was
five or six weeks before I could get him
right again."
John C. Kirkpatrick, manager of the
Palace Hotel and a road driver who loves
the game, said: "The speedway Is not fit
to drive over in its present condition. It
will have to be reclayed in order to make
it safe."
At the present time, through persistent
neglect, the clay surface has been washed
or blown away in a thousand places-,
leaving ruts and holes in the road that
would certainly bring disaster if It were
ever used for the purpose for which it
was built. Drivers know this and have
reluctantly been compelled to abandon at
tempts to send their roadsters over it at
anything faster than a walk. Not only is
the road ruined, but the turf bordering It
has been so neglected that the grass is
sere and yellow and the shrubbery is
covered with the red dust of the road.
Recently an attempt was made to oil the
speedway, but the defects in the surfac
ing will render this more of an injury
than a benefit. The king of pacers, Dan
Patch, would have difficulty in doing a
mile over it In 2:20, even supposing that
his owner could be prevailed to risk the
animal in the trial.
This speedway was constructed in 1S88
by private subscription. A committee of
gentlemen who were admirers of road
sters, headed by Charles Webb Howard,
president of the Spring Valley Water
Company, raised by private subscription
$32,500, all of which was put into the con
struction of the speedway. It was sur
faced with clay for a length of a mile
and a quarter and through the center a
hedge was run to prevent collisions. On
Its completion It was considered to be one
of the most perfect speedways for public
use in the United States.
It was turned over to the Park Commis
sioners at absolutely no expense, with the
understanding that this body would keep
it in perfect repair, and was gladly ac
cepted under those conditions. Among the
contributors to the fund for construction
were such enthusiastic horsemen as Fred
Sharon, Christopher W. Smith, Fred and
Will Talbot, Adolph B. Spreckels, Charles
"Webb Howard, Adolph Sutro and a host
of others, who gladly contributed amounts
up to $500 apiece to build the road.
SURFACING WASHED AWAY.
Owners and lovers of fast trotting stock
of this city are bewailing the carelessness
and negelect that has brought to utter
ruin the once magnificent speedway in
Golden Gate Park. In its present condi
tion it would be utterly unsafe to speed
a good horse over it and permanent in-
Jury to an animal sent at a rapid gait
on the ruined road would be almost cer
tain to result.
The first name to be considered was
that of Leonard Leavey, chief bookkeeper
of the Board of "Works, who was raised
from $1800 to $2100 per year without any
provision for the raise being made by the
Supervisors in the last annual tax budget.
President Causey of the Board of Works
held that the' board named had ample au
thority to increase salaries if It so desired
and declared that Leavey's salary was
raised because he was worth it and the
amount was not any higher than that re
ceived by head bookkeepers In private
business houses. The committee, seeing
that it had a mountain of labor before it,
decided to take up consideration of the
matter to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock.
The joint Committee on Judiciary and
Health recommended to the Board of Su
pervisors at its meeting the passage ofc an
ordinance extending the limits within
which it Is unlawful to keep more than
two cows or swine and the bill will be
considered at next Monday's meeting,
when interested parties will attend.
The ordinance ordering the repavinjr of
Spear street, between Mission and Mar
ket, at a cost of not to exceed $13,000 was
passed to print.
Connor opposed the ordinance authoriz
ing an expenditure of $1000 to defray the
expenses of Chief Engineer Sullivan ot
the Fire Department In attending tne
convention of Fire Engineers in Atlanflc
City, N, J. Connor said it would be a bad
precedent to establish and the board had
no right to expend the money for the
purpose named. Wilson said Sullivan was
being sent by the Fire Commission to
study the various fire departments of
Eastern cities. The ordinance was finally
passed.
The Mayor's veto of the ordinance
authorizing an expenditure of $517 for tr/o
horses for the Almshouse was overridden
by the votes of fifteen Supervisors. The
Mayor held that the price charged was
excessive, but evidence was adduced that
the horses were exceptionally heavy and
could not be purchased for less.
The communication from the Hack
men's Union calling attention to the de
plorable condition of Mission road, be
tween Onondaga avenue and the county
line, was referred to the Street Commit
tee. The union desires to have the road
oiled so that traffic may not be impeded.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee be
gan an inquiry yesterday into the whole
sale Increases in salaries of subordinates
by the Board of Public Works and the
Board of Health. The committee was
fortified with a list of some seventy em
ployes who were favored by the boarda
named and the names were taken up 3er*
iatim for the purpose of inquiring into the
reasons for the increases. >>. :

Within a few days nothing will remain
to remind people that the encampment
was held here. The fact that thousands of
veterans visited this city for a week has
gone down to history and will Be looked
back upon as one of the most remark
able gatherings held in this vicinity in
years. All the decorations are being re
moved from houses and streets and in a
few days every vestige will be gone.
Scores of men worked all day yesterday
stripping the arches of their thousands of
electric lights: The flag' poles were
stripped of their flags and the poles are
being carted away to the Corporation
yard, there to remain until some other
celebration requires their use. The flag
poles are the property of the municipality
and were made for permanent use.
Every wire that stxetc.es across the
main thoroughfare Is being taken down
and the thousands of incandescent lamps
used are being set aside for future use.
The citizens have removed the bunting
and designs that beautified their places of
business and the streets no longer pre
sent a holiday appearance.
Few of the veterans remain here. For
the last three days the old soldiers have
been departing on special and regular
trains for their homes, delighted with
their trip and highly pleased with the hos
pitality of the people of thi3 State.
The total fund available for the recep
tion and entertainment of the Grand
Army was $55,920 75. Of this amount the
Legislature made an appropriation of $25,
000, and $30,920 75 was contributed by vol
untary subscription.
RECENT CONTRIBUTORS.

tained visitors with lavish hospitality.

REMOVING DECORATIONS.
An Interesting session of the executive
committee of the general committee of
management. Thirty-seventh National

Grand Hotel. General George Stone,

mittee to meet all Its obligations. The

and generous work performed by the San

campment.
The chairman of the parade committee
in his report relative to the construction
of the reviewing stands on Van Ness ave
nue stated that extra expense and much
trouble were caused by the refusal of An
drew Magulre to extend to the committee
the commonest kind of civility.
EXPENSE OF ENCAMPMENT.
She cays that during all that time he
was writing to her and she was answering
his letters, and during her visit to him
and his hurried visit to New York she
knew nothing of the divorce and actrd
toward him es a dutiful and loving wife.
When she learned of his alleged duplicity
she says she retained attorneys to defend
her against him. White died soon after
his wife discovered that he had secured a
divorce, thus nipping in the bud her ef
forts to secure redress. When his will
was filed it was discovered that he had
completely overlooked her. leaving all of
his large estate to brothers and sisters
and their children. Ehe is now suing the
executors of his will to recover her share
of the property, claiming that it was all
saved during their married life and hence
Â¦was community holdings.
The suit involves a fortune estimated to
be as large as J100.000, and Mrs. White's
complaint contains many sensational
charges. According to her complaint the
was married to White at Santa Cruz in
1883. Two weeks after her marriage she
tf.scovered that her husband had been liv
ing a dual life, and .when she accused
him of It she says he admitted it.
Ehe says that when she taxed her hus
band with being other than the upright,
respectable merchant he posed as being.
he acknowledged his guilt and promised
her that he would forsake the women he
had been associating with and become a
true and loving husband. He suggested,
6he 6ays. that as he feared that if he at
tempted to break suddenly from them
they would expose him and disgrace
him, she should go on a visit to Europe,
return to New Tork after an absence of
a year, meet him and establish a home
far from the reach of those in whose toil3
he was. Mrs. White says she followoJ
her husband's suggestion and went to
Europe, but returned within three
months. She wrote to him and received a
reply telling her to remain in New York
and promising to Join her there when he
could dispose of his business. Letter fol
lowed letter, she eays. all being in tfie
same loving strain, but he did not go to
New York, and In the early part of the
next year she came out to San Francisco.
She remained for three weeks, during
which her husband treated her with ex
treme kindness and reiterated his prom
ises to close out his business as soon as
opportunity offered. Tpon her return to
New York, she says, he still kept up his
correspondence, and even made her a fly-
Ing visit.
It was not until several months ha4
pone by and White had again failed to
keep his promises that she learned, she
says, how she had been treated by the
man she loved and trusted. She learned
that during all the time that White was
corresponding Â¦with her and was so pro
lific in his promises he was conniving
with persons under his control to secire
a divorce from her on the ground of de
sertion. She says that by committing per
jury he secured an affidavit to the effect
that she had deserted him and that 5n
October, 1SP4, by swearing falsely to an
affidavit for a publication of summons he
procured an order of court ordering the
publication of the summons. The sum
mons, 6he says, was not published and he
was granted a decree, her default bein?
entered.
A tale of man's duplicity and woman's
trustfulness was unfolded In Judge
Troutt's court yesterday when the suit
was called of Jennie White against the
executors of the estate of her late hus
band. Jonathan LJoyd White, at one
time a well-known and prosperous Kear
ny-street merchant, who was killeC in the
fire that destroyed the Baldwin Hotei.
The suit was given but a half-hour's
hearing ar.d then continued until to-mor
row at 2:30. but during that time enough
evidence was taken to show that Mrs.
White has been, if her story be true, a
much abused woman.

Sends the following appreciatire tcu
tlmonial to the virtues of Cutlcura for
distressing skin troubles peculiar to
that country : â
" I -wish to speak of the merits? of
Cuticnra Soap. In the first place it has
no equal. I hare been using it for some
time and I find it to be an excellent
remedy for all skin troubles. I h*va
been using other well known soaps, but
I can truly say, they are not in it with
the Cutlcura. This country is tho
place to test the merits of Cuticnra as
one is troubled with all kinds of skia
troubles."
Millions of the world's best peopla

Ointment, for â¢ preserving, purifying
and beautifying the skin, for cleansing
the scalp of crusts, scales and dandruff,
