Mrs. Fletcher Bent was drowned before
the eyes of her son, who made frantic
endeavors to reach her with an oar.
Eleven persons managed to get away on
a life raft and were for a long time given
up as lost. The raft reached shore with ten
survivors and one dead body. They are:
Charles Bruce, first officer: James Ward,
chief engineer; T. Pizzoti, second assist
ant engineer; John McKown, oiler; J.
Driscoll, oiler; W. Hughes, fireman; 'w.
Robertson, fireman; James Alwood, sea
man; H. Webber, passenger; C. Johnson,
The women wept and screamed, while
many of the men howled In sheer panic.
The captain's boat remained upright until
eighteen terror-stricken persons had
swung themselves down the ropes into It.
Then it capsized and tipped the occupants
into the turbulent water. The captain
righted the little craft as it tippled on
the crest of a wave and six of the orig
inal passengers regained the boat.
South Portland, bound for San
Francisco from Portland, blundering far
out of her course, struck on the reefs off
Cape Blanco.
The shock drove her bow high on the
rocks, the beating: screw held her there
for one long minute, then she slid slowly
off the reef and sank. All the boats were
launched, all but two capsized imme
diately, or were crunched against the
steamer's side by the terrific seas, and
out of a total of forty passengers and
crew, twenty-one are believed to" have
been drowned.
When the vessel struck there was the
greatest confusion. Members of the crew
rushed up and down the deck trying to
calm the distracted passengers, but the
seriousness of the situation was so ap
parent that their fear could not be al
layed, and a mad rush was soon made for
the boats.

"At 5:15 o'clock yesterday afternoon a dense fog was covering the mouth
of the Coquille River below Bandon. I thought I could make Port Or
ford, eight miles below Cape Blanco, but so dense was the fog and so dark
and tempestuous the weather that no bearing could be taken. All boats were
launched, but in my belief the only one that lived is the one that landed. I
was the last to leave the sinking shio. The scene aboard was fearful: women
screamed and the men were scarcely more brave. Those saved with me are

PORT ORFORD. .Oct. 20.â The evidence submitted at the Coroner's
jury to-day goes to prove that Captain Mclntyre deserted his vessel half an
hour before she sank and even before the passengers or crew had been em
barked. The survivors . claim . that the captain left in the first officer's
boat instead of his own. and that after he" had disappeared in the fog the
crew, under the direction of First Officer Bruce, had to construct rafts from
spars and hatches on which to save themselves, the boats having been
smashed against the ship's side or capsized and drifted away.
The body of Charles Huson. first assistant engineer, is here, and the
jury found that he came to his death from exhaustion caused by his expo
sure on the raft, to which he clung half frozen for many hours.

M1DDL.ETOWN, N. Y., Oct. 20.â Having
walked 8000 miles to cure himself of con
sumption, K. C. Norris, for years a news
paper man in California and other West
ern States,* arrived here to-day. Norris
has walked all the way from California,
and is now bound for New York, where
he once resided. He left San Francisco
August 8, 1301, to see if he could not re
cover his health, physicians having told
him that he had consumption and could
live but a short time. He then weighed
ninety-six pounds. His weight now is 13G
pounds.
Norris' route has been a crooked one.
He followed the railroads all the time,
Â¦with the exception of a few days when
he struck out for the forests of Colorado
and got lost. From San Francisco he
went to Portland, Or., thence to Seattle,

BOSTON, Oct. 20.â Terry McGovern,
former featherweight champion of the
world, was given the decision over Jimmy
Briggs of Chelsea to-night after a hard
fifteen-round battle before the Criterion
Athletic Club. For ten rounds the ex
champlon seemed to have lost his . old
time cunning, and even a favorable de
cision for him seemed doubtful. Toward
the end, however, superior ring general
ship told the story, and he had the Chel
sea boy completely at his mercy.
During the last four rounds McGovern
administered terrific punishment, but he
was unable to land a decisive blow, and
as the final bell found both men on their
feet, a decision was given on points.
At the start McGovern invited" in-fight
ing, rushing into clinches whenever pos
sible, but he fared badly at this game,
and received a severe pummeling during
the early part of the battle. Briggs was
at hie best at this style of fighting, aW
rained blowafter blow Upon McGovern's
wind and neck in every clinch. In the
breakaway McGovern seemed weak, and
well directed blows in the fourth and
ninth rounds sent him to the floor.
At the end of the tenth,' when It seemed
that the ex-champion had an almost in
'surmountable handicap to overcome, he
adopted an open style of fighting and had
everything his own way until the end.

There is no clew yet as to who the-of

who is a promising young artist
and the protege of several wealthy wom

ding took place at San Jose in August of

During the trial of the suit several
months ago Mrs. Rosenberg sought to
prove that the marriage was legal be
cause young Rosenberg had lived with
her after he became of age. She testi
fied that after the marriage they came
to this city and lived together for two
weeks, and that after he left her and
went to Berlin to study music she fol
lowed,, him and lived with him there for
"ten months. From there she went to
Warsaw, where, she says, they were to
gether for almost a year. .Corroborative
evidence was lacking, however, with the
result that the Rosenbergs succeeded in
getting the young people separated.

the car and the entire delegation turned
its attention to making the two sisters as
comfortable as possible. Banker Schlafly
wired ahead to the Palace for an extra
room and Monday afternoon found the
Misses Corrigan enjoying the pleasures of
the bankers' convention in San Francisco.
When the Schlaflys and their young
guest entered their car they were
astounded by the sound of a familiar
voice that gave them greeting and glanc
ing forward they were surprised to dis
cover Miss Kate Corrigan comfortably re
clining in a seat. It took but < a few
words for the young lady to explain her
unexpected presence in Denver. Her
relatives had finally yielded to her plead
ings, and, hurriedly packing her traveling
bag, she had caught the next train out of
Kansas City and by a stroke of good luck
had been able to overtake the Missouri
special at Denver.
Ten minutes later Miss Kate was at her
home, pleading with her parents for per
mission to Join her sister in the Far West
and picturing to them the many
dangers that might . surround sister
Agnes if she were allowed to roam about
the wild and woolly thoroughfares of San
Francisco. Just what effect these plead
ings had may be readily Imagined through
the aid of later developments. . . â¢ . Â¦ ...
At Denver the Missouri special was de
layed several hours, during which the oc
cupants of the cars -enjoyed themselves
seeing the Bights of the mining town, re
turning a few minutes before the trip
was resumed.
Hurrying . to their home the young la
dies were bitterly disappointed by the
contrary views taken by their relatives
regarding the trip,, the latter "taking the
broad view that inasmuch as the Misses
Corrigan were not bankers they could not
possibly have any particular Interest in
the gathering of an association of finan
ciers. But . the young ladies had their
own opinion on the subject, especially
Miss Agnes, who was soon back to the
train, wearing upon her countenance a
look^that boded mischief. * .
Suddenly the signal for the starting of
the train was given, and, bidding adieu
to their friends, the Misses Corrigan re
luctantly moved toward the car door.
Just as the latter was reached Miss Agnes
shouted to her sister that she had forgot
ten her purse and returned to the interior
of the coach. Thinking her sister would
follow her. Miss Kate . alighted. A. sec
ond later the train begjtfi moving off and
as the last car passed her Miss Kate was
surprised to see her sister standing on
the rear platform and heard the latter,
exclaim, "Well, good-by, Kate; I guess
I'll have to go through to San Francisco,
for I can't get off a moving train."
SISTERS MEET AT DENVER.
A few days agq when' the tÂ»ain bearing
the Missouri contingent of bankers
reached Kansas City the Misses Corrigan
were at the depot to greet' their old
friends, the Schlaflys, and Jn return re
ceived a warm welcome aboard the train.
Banker Schlafly's, daughter- jokingly- sug
gested that her young friends Join the
party and the Invitation was barely ut
tered before Miss Agnes Corrigan had
accepted it and her sister was not long* in
following suit . Â¦ 'â¢ Â¦'Â¦ Â¦ -
RESORTED TO CLEVER RUSE.
"I wanted to come to the convention
and I came. That is all there is about it.
My Bister had similar Inclinations and she
came.* Now you have the whole story,"
and Miss Agnes Corrigan of Kansas City
smiled sweetly at her interviewer.
The presence of the young lady and
her sister, both stylishly dressed, at the
Palace Hotel has been productive of much
amusement for the visiting bankers and
especially the â¢ delegates from Kansas
City, for to .the latter's party the young
women are duly accredited. Miss Agnes
and Miss Kate Corrigan are nieces of Ed
ward Corrigan, the well-known turfman,
and on the present visit they are the
guests of the family of August Schlafly,
president of the Missouri Trust Company
of St. Louis.

BERLJX, Oct. 20.â Count von Larrlsch-
Moennich, an Austrian nobleman, in tes
tifying to-day against the syndicate of
money lenders who are accused of at
tempted extortion, said that Immediately
after his wedding at Buffalo with Mary
Hatterfleld of Pennsylvania In June, a
New York bank sent him a draft for $30,
000 forwarded by the syndicate, which
he refused to payl This, the Count con
tinued, was the beginning of persecutions
by the money . lenfler group, which was
composed of four merchants and six
mortgage agents, of whom Ernest Rosen
til and Ludwig Zinner are directors of a
savings bank. The draft was baaed on
one of the several notes which the Count
signed in 1900. aggregating $230,000, pay
able on condition that the married one of
tflree young Countesses von Faber of Nu
remburg (daughter of Baron von Faber,
the famous pencil manufacturer), each re
puted to have a dowry of $20,000,000.
After giving the money lenders the
promissory notes the Count went to Wies
baden to court one of the Faber girls.
They discouraged his advances and later,
at his own expense, the Count went to
America and eventually married Miss
HatterfleW. On motion of counsel for the
defense the case was postponed in order
to summon witnesses from America.
- Count von Larrlsch informed^the press
to-day that the Countess, Is In Vienna;
that she knew all about the case, and
that Bhe had known about it before their
marriage. The Count classed as "absurd"
some of the statements published in the
United- States that the Countess intended
to suÂ« for a divorce.
TELEGRAPH NEWS.
NEW YORK, Oct 20.â Arguments in the
arbitration proceedings between tha Unit
ed Railroads' of San Francisco and their
employes over the wage and hour ques
tion were begun, here to-day before Com
missioner; Oscar Strauss, Patrick Cal
houn and W.D. Mahon.
Congressman E. J. -Livernash, for the
men, urged that the cost of living in San
Francisco had since April, 1902, increased
32 per cent; that wages in other employ
ments had correspondingly increased, and
the street carmen's wages, alone unln
creased, were inadequate to maintain the
American standard of living in California,
"Wages and cost of living in other cities
should not be considered and he declared
that the consideration of testimony of
this- character and the determination by
the commission of a wage rate on the ba
sis of the unchecked law of supply and
demand would mean a death blow to the
arbitration of labor disputes, trades
unionism standing for a necessary check
upon this law. 'The Income of the com
pany is so great, he said, that it can
grant the increase and still retain an
equitable ; return on Its capital and this
consideration - should determine* the com
rftission's ruling- â¢ ' .
A. A. Moore, for the company, said that
LJvernash's position was based on the
proposition that' a man In any locality
has. the\right to fix his own standard of
living; to demand . a corresponding rate
.of wages and to exclude others from tak
ing -their places by boycott, intimidation
or otherwise. He classed the statement
of a 32 per cent increase in the cost of
living as "nonsense," and said that the
San Francisco street car employes were
already receiving the highest wages re
ceived anywhere on the Pacific Slope.
The increase in the*" cos^ of living, said
Moore, did not exceed 3 per cent in any
event, while a rearrangement of th'e runs
had Increased wages 17 per cent.. The
street car service does not require skilled
labor, but unskilled intelligent labor, only
three to seven days' being necessary to
learn the work, and the wages and con
ditions were so attractive as to draw
men constantly from other occupations in
San Francisco. He introduced testimony
to show that the wages paid were high
enough sd that the men could save money.

To your measure for $15
Suppose you go to an exclusive tailor and order a long 50-
inch overcoat like the one pictured. He will charge you $25
or $30 and maybe more. He has to do it. He buys his cloth
from a jobber, and not direct from the mills. He charges
you for the style and he charges you for his name. He gets a
big price.
We make you this overcoat to your measure for $15. Here
you pay only for the merchandise, and it is never overpriced.
The cloth is bought direct from the mill at a saving of jobbers'
profits. .We make a hundred overcoats to the exclusive tail-
or's one. This immense volume reduces the cost of making,
and still the quality goes into the goods.
Place an order here- â we'll save you $10, make as stylish a
garment as you want and keep it in perfect repair.
We have some splendid rough cheviots we .would like to
show you that will make into stylish long overcoats.
Suits satisfactorily made to order for out-of-town customers
through our self-measuring system â write for blank and samples.

OFFICERS AND CREW.
Here are a few of the troubles into
which her hoodoo has led her: She had
4 hole stove in her bow by the ice on
June 24, 1900, and only reached Nome in
safety by the grace of a calm sea. On
September 7 of the same year she- went
ashore on Sidney Spit. She was later
kedged off. While at section 2 of the
seawall, February 5, 1M1. her cargo of
lime took fire and she had to be scuttled.
She was seriously damaged and the 1500
barrels of lime which comprised her cargo
were lost. She remained in the mud, the
tide rising and falling In her hold and
cabin?, until March 17, 1901, when she was
raised and cgain put into commission. A
few months ago. while seeking refuge
.from a stcrm. her anchor fouled the
.weather bureau's cable connecting Point
Reyes with the Farallones and only by
the cutting of the cable was the vessel
saved from the rocks.
The Caroline Miller traded along the
Atlantic Coast for some time and was
finally purchased by the Progreso Steam
ship Companv, renamed South Portland
and brought cut to this coast, where she
had been sailing ever since. A few weeks
ago' che again changed owners and now

Co. of 3 California etreet.
Captain Miller, who now commands the
steamship Enterprise, was a member of
the pyndlcate. The rejuvenated. Ameri
canized Dawn was named after Mrs. Mil
ler, and Captain Miller assumed com
mand.

EUREKA. Oct. 30.-Th? steam schooner
laqua. during the thick fog of last n!*ht
struck the rocks off Point Gorda and Is
thought to be either nonr waiting for a"
tuK from San Francisco to tow her to
port or, proceeding slowly under her own
steam southward.
The report of the accident; which oc
curred at about midnisht. was brought
to Eureka this morning by thÂ« steamer
Pomona, to which four of the\ix pas
i sengers on the laqua were transferred.
; The two remaining passengers, not thlnk
1 Ing themselves In any particular danger,
declined to leave the ship.
From the passengers on the laqua It
was learned that the vessel while en
deavoring to avoid a rock which loomed
up ahead was backed into a number of
smaller rocks astern. After bumping and
scraping among them the steamer finally
got Into deeper water. When the rocks
were cleared It was found tnat she had
lost her rudder and was leaking. The
pumps soon â¢ got the water under control
and when the passengers left there
seemed little danger from, this source.
The mate was In charge when the vessel
struck, according , to the version of the
passengers. Captain ] BonifleM was im
mediately called and succeeded In. getting
the vessel into safe water.
The Pomona heard the laqua' s signal
of distress at about 4 o'clock this morn
ing. As soon as possible. Captain Swan
son brought the steamship close enrugh
to hail the disabled vessel. A boat front*
the laqua brought' Captain . Bonifleld
aboard the Pomona,* and arrangements

Captain Swanson further stated that
there was a southwest swell on and the
weather was very thick.
"I do not care to discuss the causes of
the accident, as I do not know anything
tibout them. In .talking to me, however.
Captain Bonlfleld said that he had tafcen
particular precautions to clear Point
Gorda, and that if he had been 400 yards
farther out he would have cleared every
thing." . . ...
3, 1901. she went on Duxbury reef, knock
ing out her bottom. She was finally
floated and towed to San Francisco,
where she was 'repaired at great cost.
Her next accident Â¦ was last year about
this time when off Point Gorda; she broke
her shaft and was towed to San Fran
cisco. At that time she was In command
of Captain Kylin. W. H. Carroll, travel-
Ing representative of a liquor house In
San Francisco, who was one of the pass
engers on the laqua transferred to the
Pomona, stated as follows: Â»
"A bumping and crunching noise
awakened me at about 12 o'clock. When
I got on deck the ship had been got
clear of the rocks. The fog was thick,
and I could not see the rocks of the
point, but I could hear the surf breaking
over the rocks. I learned that It was
the mate's watch. If he had not been
keeping a good lookout, the boat would
have probably, struck the rock in front of
us, and the accident would have been
worse. The vessel received her Injuries
while backing away from the danger
ahead of her. As soon as the danger
ahead was apparent. Captain Bonlfleld
was called. We had been running: under
a slow bell all night, and it Is natural to
suppose that with the continuance of
the fog the speed had not been Increased.
In conversation with Captain Bonifield
after the accident, he said that he laid
the course fully three-eighths of a point
farther out than usual for the very pur
pose of giving. Point Gorda a . wide
berth."
Captain Swanson of the Pomona stated
as follows :~-$&2$i
Mrs. Fletcher Bent, the woman whose
son was saved,. Is the wife of one of the
owners of the lost steamer. She came out
to the coast from the East and according
to Captain Patterson, who met her on the
eteamer last Sunday, her home Is in Nova
Scotia. . r : -.v;
sel of her capacity. The passengers had
boarded the vessel early in the evening
on Saturday, as the exact hour of de
parture had not been fixed. It depending,
as usual, upon the finishing of the cargo.
On her way down the river the 'steamer
righted and before leaving Astoria she
had a slight list to port.
No passengers embarked at Astoria, as
the berths were all occupied. The steam
er was under orders to proceed directly
to San Francisco, and all was well at
2 o'clock Sunday afternoon, when In the
hands of Captain Mclntyre she crossed
out over the bar. A report from Astoria
says that the South Portland was some
what heavy at the *ow when she .de
parted, but marine men say this would
have no bearing on the case, as It was
due to the thick fog that the vessel ran
on the reef.' Had she foundered as a
result of rough water, the weight and po
sition of the cargo might hAve had some
thing to do with the accident. :
First Officer Bruce, who was at first
reported among the lost, is a son of Cap
tain Bruce, a prominent ship owner of
San Francisco. Second Officer- Killgore
also comes from a family of seafaring
men, being the son of Captain Killgore,
a veteran mariner on the Pacific Coast!
Little Is known here of the crew. The
steamer making San Francisco her home
port, it Is supposed that most of the men
hail from that port,
According to reports from survivors, It
was from twenty minutes to one hour
after striking: the reef until the South
Portland sank. The vessel is presumed
to have struck on the northwest swash
rock of Cape Blanco reef. In launching
the boat they evidently dumped the pas
sengers and erew^as No. 1 boat is still
adrift without occupants. No. 2 boat", in
charge of Captain Mclntyre, landed, at
Port Orford beach at 5:30 a. m. with seven
persons aboard. This boat, manned by
two survivors and Port Orford men, put
out In search of the raft; and succeeded
In, finding and landing it at Port Orford
with the remaining survivors at 12:30 p"ml'
The tug of the Simpson Lumber Com
pany and the Bandon life-saving crew
are using thelrbest endeavors to rescue
any other survivors. First Officer Bruce;
who was. on the bridge at the time of
the disaster, and Chief Engineer Ward
The latest advices to-night from Port
Orford are , that the relief parties have
returned to shore, having been driven In
by the fog and darkness. The tug Co
lumbia was sighted near the scene of the
wreck and she is expected to cruise
around there until morning. It is now
thought that only six more lives on the
wrecked steamer can be saved, as all the
others have perished. These six were last
seen clinging to a second raft constructed
out of the steamer's hatches and were
being carried in a southerly direction by
the current. The only hope for their re
covery Is that the wind will drive them
near shore, where they can be picked up.
The survivors of the wreck are being
tenderly cared for at Knapp's Hotel, in
Port Orford, where everything that can
add to their comfort Is provided. They
will all be In a condition to move to-mor
row,, and will start on their way home.
A patrol has been placed on the beach
in the immediate .vl&nity of the wreck
and wherever- it is anticipated t^ie cur
rent will carry the few remaining sur
vivors ashore. Only at intervals to-day
was the weather such as to permit of
any rescue work, the fog would set in
now and then and come up and down as
quickly as a drop curtain.
TUG NEAR THE WRECK.
Captain Mclntyre Is disinclined to talk
for publication on the matter pertaining
to the course his ship was traveling, or
whether she was off her course when she
ran on Blanco reef. When questioned by
a correspondent, hejsald:
"We had been running In a blinding
fog ever since we left the Columbia
River and lt> was very thick when we
struck. You could not see any distance.
There were seventeen In my boat when
we left the sinking steamer. When away
from the ship's side our boat swamped
and went down. I, with a seaman, got
In again, bailed her out and got five
others In with us. It was 4:40 yesterday
afternoon when we struck and we were
in the boat until 5:30 this morrBng, hav
ing to make shore with one oar and a
piece of mast. I will .make my* full and
complete statement as to the cause of the
accident to the inspectors."
The Bandon life-saving crew went over
land to Port Crford and relieved Cap
tain Mclntyre's exhausted crew, who are
In search of survivors, and they had not
returned at a late hour. The tug Colum
bia is In the vicinity of the wreck, having
left Coos Bay at 10 o'clock this morning,
as- soon as the fog cleared so she could
get/ out, but no news has been heard of
her.

Six Unfortunates May Have Been
Rescued In the Night.
PORT ORFORD. Oct. 20.â It seems that
a raft made of spars, with planks lashed
crosswise on them, is adrift somewhere
In the ocean with six people on it. Chief
Engineer Ward, who was on" the big raft,
reports having seen ..this little raft after
leaving: the ship. There was no room on
the bigger float for the six survivors and
the two makeshift crafts drifted apart in
the fog.

with six people on It was seen off the
coast there this evening and if so the
survivors may have been rescued ere this.

desolate part of the country.

THE YAQUI WOMEN
SHOW GREAT BRAVERY
They May Now Pose as the Amazons
of America.
In some respects the Yaqui Indian wo
men of Northern Mexico are peerless
throughout the world. A generation ago
General Sherman said that the Yaquis
were the Spartans of America, Had he
lived till. now he might have added that
the wives and daughters of the Yaquis
are the modern Amazons, for the women
of that Indian tribe are active partici
pants in the interminable warfare that
the Yaquis wage against the Mexican
soldiery.
Here is a bit of a recent official state
ment made by Surgeon Jose Batiste Al
varado of Guaymas, Mexico, to General
Torres, commander of the third zone in
the republic:
"Five Yaqui women soldiers captured
by the Mexicans were In the public hos
pitals on the outskirts of Guaymas last
month,. Each had a gunshot wound.'
None uttered complaint at any time, no
matter what her suffering might be. One
woman's hand was half shot away, the
result of a bullet wound two years ago.
She said she had gone back to her hus
band In the Yaoul camp as soon as the
hand healed, and that she would stick
to her share in the war with Mexico
until she was killed. One of the women
In the hospital died with blood poisoning
from a saber cut in the head. I ampu
tated one young Yaqui woman soldier's
leg at the knee."
This statement, simple and brief as it
is, outlines significantly the heroic part
played by the feminine members of the
great Yaqui tribe In Its rebellion against
the authority of President Diaz In Mex
ico. Down among the lonely canyons
and' across, the yellow, sandy wastes of
Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico, trage
dies told by the rurales and army officers
testify to the marvelous daring and phys
ical endurance of the Yaqui women,
whose one idea in life is tp die with their
faces to the Mexican foe. The principle
that fires the blood in their veins to mur
derous heat is as precious to their sav
age breasts as that which has urged any
people to, fight against a dictating and
encroaching power. They refuse to have
their abiding places chalked out by hated
hands upon the land that was their own
for centuries, and for possession of which
they have fought since that day that Cor
tez came.
In every camp of Mexican soldiers ve
racious anecdotes are related of young,
strong and graceful Yaqul women, who,
leaving their rude homes, have,. gone
among the gulches ' and mountain passes
to risk their lives by shot and shell, to
endure the awful privations of war and to
shoot and slay Mexicans, Just as their
fathers and brothers and 'husbands are
doing. - Dally the Mexican army officers
tell of Yaqui girls who. have been drilled
in the work of a soldier from their early
youth, and who have looked upon a sol
dier's life as a sacred 'duty in defense of
ancient tribal rights.â Brooklyn Eagle.

Mrs. Archibald Little in a recent maga

court, th'at the Empress Dowager Is of
"the type so well known in every land
where society exists. Were shÂ« an Eng
lish mother she would, one feels at once,
marry all her daughters to eldest sons,
irrespective of whether they were luna
tics of confirmed dipsomaniacs." The
Emperor of China is of another disposi
tion. At a party he repeatedly, kissed a
little American girl of 5 years. "How
had the very idea of such a thing ever
been suggested to him? No Chinese man
throughout the whole length and breadth
of the vast Chinese empire ever kisses
wife or child unless he has been taught
to do so by a foreigner. No Chinese
mother ever kisses her child.. The nearest
she gets to it Is lifting her child's face
up to hers, and, as it were, smelling at
it. Yet here was the Emperor of China
evidently versed in the practice, so; that
directly he saw this foreign little girl he
took her. up and kissed her as If it were
the most natural thing in^the world, while
to the everyday Chinaman this would be
a most unnatural and Indeed repulsive
proceeding. â Chicago News.

This and much other waste material is
given a ' commercial value and proceeds
from its sale makes the "homes" self
supporting. Certain equipment is neces
sary to put them into operation. Funds
are thus obtained by the sale of shares
in the incorporated Salvation Army In
dustrial Homes Company. Such a salvage
â¢Institution has been in operation success
fully in * San Francisco, an average of
fifteen men being permanently employed
with four or five "floaters" being daily
given temporary work.
"We have decided that the time Is ripe
for establishing a . 'home' in Oakland,"
said Major Reid to-day, "and to that end
we have in mind the old army headquar
ters on Eighth street.- The only obstacle,
so far as that place is concerned, is the
rental figure, which looks a bit too high.
I have been negotiating there, but am
also looking elsewhere for a desirable
location. The work of the 'homes! is con
ducted under general supervision from
the Pacific Coast division headquarters in
San Francisco, where information can be
had."
The "Industrial Home" Is one of the
most important departments in the wide
field of the army's operations among the
submerged populations in the large cities.
Its purpose, as explained- to-day by Major
Reid, Is to provide a place of temporary
employment for the wanderers and float
ing wayfarers who come under the army's
observation. Through these institutions
much of the waste, such as cast off gar
ments, paper, furniture and the like, ia
collected, sorted, distributed and sold. In
the shape, of paper waste alone large
quantities are prepared and sold to the
paper mills. Major Reid, for the army,
has a contract with the Antioch Paper
Company to take all the waste he can
send to the mills. 'â¢;â¢ .
Negotiations have been opened by the
Salvation Army "for the reoccupancy of
its old home on Eisrht street, between
Webster and Alice. Major George Reid,
In charges of the Industrial Homes pro
jects of the army on the Pacific Coast,
has in hand the opening of one of those
Institutions in this city and has selected
the big "barracks" as a suitable location
for a "home" in Oakland. Whether this
site will be' chosen, or another selected,
depends upon the figure that the owner,
William Aehby of Berkeley, Is willing to
make as to rental. tv

them, as there are enough co-eds on hand
every day to absorb the entire supply.
Too many peanuts and too little yell
ing broueht about a crisis to-day on the
bleachers at the University of California
campus and the "rooters" were begged
to choose between the vegetable and the
voice. Fortunately the "rooters" decided
to oust the peanut "butcher" and the uni
versity Is savcii.
"Veil loader Philip Carey has been hav-
Ir.s a lot of trouble lately trying to raise
a noise on the campus. Just about the
time he got ready to give the signal for
a yell 300 or 400 throats would be so clog
ged up with peanuts that not a sound
could get through. In this dilemma the
yell leader appealed to ' the "yell com
mittee" to do "eomethinK to prevent the
congestion. And so the committee decided
to put the cuestion of peanuts or yells
to a vote this-afternoon on the bleachers.

mittee, backed up by his colleaguesâ A.

"It certainly was an outrage," said
Newton to-day. "The language this man
used was simply frightful. We tried to
avoid trouble with him, as we knew he
must be drunk, but he seemed to have
an insane desire to injure us. The part I
can't understand is the Constable's, whose
duty it was to arrest. the man. Instead
he stood by and let Fisher, , do as he
pleased."
- The ladles got over their fright of last
night and went back to the "rummage
sale" this morning, but they were not
free from annoyance from Fisher, who
sent a man to them to represent himself
as the Health Officer. The counterfeit
Health Officer trie,d to quarantine the
place, but the ladies were not scared by
his representations and kept on selling
their goods. An attempt will be made
by the reputable people of West Berke
ley to have Fisher's license revoked.
Woodruff grappled with Fisher and they
rolled over and over on the floor. When
Newton finally turned on' the lights
again the two men began pummeling
each other with chairs and other mov
ables. In the midst of this' melee some
of Fisher's patrons rushed in and forcibly
carried him away. In his struggles with
these men Fisher . broke two lights of
glass in the door. Constable Charles, E.
Wulferdlngen was present during this
struggle, but did not interfere with Fisher
nor attempt to arrest him.
CONSTABLE'S QUEER ACTIONS.
The women then walked out of * the
place, leaving Newton behind to shut off
the lights. Fisher followed the party a
short distance, sweating at them and
threatening Woodruff. As they paid no
attention to him. Fisher returned to the
barracks and rushed upon Newton, who
was coming out of the door. The fren
zied man threw . Newton hack Into the
place and began pummeling him with his
fists. . In the scuffle Newton was thrown
against a glass case, .which broke and at
tracted the attention of Woodruff, who
ran back to assist him.
FISHES, FOLLOWS PARTY.
The alleged assault occurred about 9:30
o'clock last night, just as its victims
were closing the doors after the "rum
mage sale" they are conducting for the
benefit of the Ladles' Aid Society. The
scene was the Salvation Army barracks
in the Schmidt block on University ave
nue, near Sixth street, and two doors re
moved from Fisher's saloon. There were
present, besides Newton, Mrs. W. W.
Bradley, Mrs. Newton. Mt. and Mrs. M.
C. Woodruff* Mrs. D. G. Hay and Mrs.
Joseph McClaln.
Fisher stood in the doorway Just as
Newton wa/> about to put out the lights.
One of the ladles, Mrs. Bradley, seeing
him there, asked him If he wanted to go
In.
"I'll go in if I want to," replied Fisher,
"and nobody will stop me."
On the allegation that he used vile lan
guage In' the presence of ladles of the
Trinity Methodist, Church and attacked
two men with his .fists, Samuel Fisher,
keeper of a saloon known as "The Can
teen" In West Berkeley, was 'sought to
day by the police, who want him on a
charge of disturbing the peace. The war
rant was sworn out by K. E. Newton, a
Center-street real estate dealer, one- of
the men alleged to have been struck by
Fisher. The saloon man was not arrest
ed and he probably never will be, as It
is rumored he left town this morning for

prisoner has served two terms In San
Quentin. On August 21, 1S96, he was
sentenced to serve two and a half years
for an attempt to commit burglary, and
on December 16, 1899, he was sentenced
to serve five years for burglary. Between
his two terms In San Quentin he served
a term of four months. in the County
Jail. He was arrested for robbery, but
the charge was reduced to petty larceny.
He is looked upon by the police as one
of the most dangerous crooks in the city.
Early yesterday morning Thomas
Cronin was held up and robbed of $30 at
Commercial and Kearny streets, and
Alien Dale, alias Frank Ballard, was
seen running away from the scene. He
was chased and captured by Policemen
Nelson and Welsh, and when searched
$30 was found in his pockets.
Dale was arrested a few weeks ago on

the ordinance under which the charge
was made was unconstitutional.

Letson Balliet, against whom Post
master General Payne . has issued a
"fraud order," filed a petition In the
United States Circuit Court yesterday, for
an Injunction to restrain Postmaster Mon
tague from carrying into effect the or

Balliet takes the position that the or
der is an arbltary assumption and exer
cise of power unwarranted by the consti
tution of' the United States and that the
act of Congress under which the Post
master General has acted is unconstitu
tional.
Balliet is under conviction by the Fed

ing used the mails in furtherance of a
swindling mining scheme and the case is
now on appeal before the Supreme Court

There are three distinct charges against
Wolf. It is alleged that on three different
occasions he received money for the pur
pose of extending unusual favors to the
donor. Bennett, it is said, knew that
Wolf was taking money, and failed to
make a report of It at headquarters. The
sergeant would have been charged with
accepting a bribe, but under the penal
code, it would have to be proven that
money was given for the commission of
an illegal act. As this could not be
proven the accused sergeant was charged
with violating a rule of the department
which makes it an offense to accept
money without first consulting the com
missioners.
A ehort time ago one of the police com
missioners gained information that mem
bers of the department were extending
protection to certain business houses
south of Market street, in consideration
of a monthly fee. A quiet investigation
was instituted, and as a result several
policemen's names were dragged into a
scandal. A bartender for Simpson &
Neil, at the corner of Mission and Sev
enth Btreets, declared that on different oc
casions he had paid Wolf money.
OnÂ© of the proprietors denies this, but
nevertheless, the statement impressed the
commissioners, and thry discussed the
matter in executive session. Wolf and
four patrolmen were taken from their
beats and detailed to outlying sections,
and nothing more was done for a couple
of days until the corruption charge be
came public property. Then the commis
sion again acted, and the two men named
were suspended and charges brought
against them.
Soreear.t Reuben Wolf and Policeman
Joseph E. Bennett of the local police de
partment have been suspended from duty,
and last night were formally charged be
fore the police commissioners with cor
ruption in office. The charges grew out
of the allegation that Wolf has been levy
ing tribute on saloons in the section over
which he has command. Bennett is not
paid to have taken any money, but Is
charged with having had Information of
Wolfe alleged acts, but failed to report
the same to the Chief of Police
Joseph B. Allen, a barber, employed In
the Oaks barber shop on Ellis street, and
Miss L. Coughlin were accidentally suffo
cated by illuminating gas last Sunday or
Monday night on the third floor of a lodg
ing-house at 416 O'Farrell street. Allen
engaged the room between 11 and 12
o'clock last Sunday night and went out
once for liquor, returning tÂ«Â» the rooir In
less than half an hour They wyte round
dead at 7 o'clock yes'.erda* morning, with
gas escaping from, an open burner.
The couple were first noticed between 10
ara 11 o'clock on Sunday night, when
they entered the grocery on the corner
of William and O'Farrell streets, both In
toxicated. Mrs. Kate Miller, the land
lady, opened the door of the room on
Monday forenoon between 10 and 11
o'clock with a pasEkey and saw that the
oouple were asleep, but she Informed
Deputy Coroner Charles Meehan that
there was no odor of escaping gas at that
time and about the room. She- then closed
the door and paid no further attention
until 7 o'clock yesterday morning,
when her attention was attracted by
the odor of gas and she opened the door
and found them dead. This statement,
however, was contradicted later by Mrs.
Miller, when Detective Reynolds called
upon her and inquired about the matter.
She told the detective that on Monday
forenoon a man and a woman called at
the house and made a proposition to buy
the place. Mrs. Miller showed them
through the house and when they reached
the third floor the man sniffed the odor
of escaping gas. At the end of the hall
Mrs. Miller found a burner that was part
ly open and from which the suffocating
fluid was escaping. She turned it off and
thought nothing more about the matter
until she noticed gas escaping yesterday.
The dead woman was evidently between
30 and S5 years old. Among her efftcts
was found an installment receipt for a
pair of earrings that ehe was buying from
a jeweler on Kearny street. This bore the
name, "Miss L. Coglln." The Morgue rec
ords show the name as "Mrs." L. Coglin.
Ernest Engdahl. manager of the Jewelry
establishment, called at the Morgue later
In the day and identified the woman as
the one who had given him the name of
"Miss L. Coglin." Shortly afterward the
young woman was identified by a relative
as Miss L. Coughlin, a member of a re
spectable family in this city. The fact of
the identification was suppressed by the
Morgrue officials.
Allen was a single man and resided at 33
William street. Among his effects was a
bank book on the Hlbernia Bank show
ing a balance in his favor of $5S0.
It is alleged further that these repre
sentations were false and that the only
mining property owned by the Sunset
Mining Company was the Old Glory mine,
which was incorporated on March 3, 1900.
As a proof of his solvency and good stand
ing in the community Rumble used 'to
refer his correspondents to the Alliance
Bank, an institution created by himself,
It Is alleged, with paper capital:
Inspector O'Connell said that Rumble
was very careful not to distribute any of
his circulars on this coast and that he
worked exclusively upon people in the
East. For this reason the Inspector found
It difficult to get evidence, but he says
that he has a first class case against
Rumble and will have no trouble in prov
ing it. V- -
After a year of very hard work in gath
ering evidence so that a conviction might
reasonably be assured. Postofflce Inspec
tor James O'Connell yesterday afternoon
took into custody George W. Rumble on
an indictment charging him with having
used the mails for the purpose of de
frauding unsuspecting persons < of their
money. United States Marshal John H.
Shine assisted Inspector O'Connell in
making the arrest. Rumble was taken
before United States Court Commissioner
Heacock and was released on furnishing
bonds In the sum of $3000.
Rumble was found at his offices, B7 and
58 Chronicle building. He expressed, re
gret that the arrest had not been 'made
earlier in the day so that he might have
had more time in which to procure, his
bail. The complaint, which is sworn to
by Inspector O'Connell. alleges that on
March 1, 1903. Rumble devised a scheme
to defraud G. Morgan Lesher of Fre
mont, Ohio, and FÂ»Â»ink T. Terry of Mil
waukee, Wis.. by Inciting them to open
a correspondence through the postofflce
with him as secretary of the Sunset Min
ing Company and owner of â¢ the Amo
hydraulic mine and a certain gold dredger
and the Old Glory mine, all in Butte
County.
It Is alleged that Rumble represented
to his correspondents that these- mines
were being actively worked and had paid
and were paying monthly dividends of 2
per cent upon the par value of tfte stock.
These mining properties purported to be
capitalized at 10.000,000 shares at the par
value of $1 per share. The stock was of
fered by Rumble at $1 75 per share and
he promised his correspondents that they
would receive 2 per cent per month upon
this par value. He further represented
that during the nine years of .the opera
tion of the mines he had paid 108 monthly
dividends which represented 2 per cent
per month on the par value of the stock.

presented a very able paper on "Trust
Accounts In Savings Banks," and it was
a composition of marked knowledge with
financial subjects.
The views of the speaker were directed
to the proper method by which trust
accounts of various kinds should be
handled by savings banks.
The main portion of Mr. Hanhart's ad
dress was as follows:

did the fund really belong? Of course mT

of the progressive bank* have refused to open
such accounts; they are not safe to the bank,

Willis Payne, president of the Consoli
dated National Bank of New York, fol
lowed with a masterly treatise on "Sav
ings Banks' That Have Failed," and he
did not mince matters in placing blame
where it- belonged. He cited many In
stances where savings banks had been
wrecked by deliberate- dishonesty of di
rectors and officers and by the payment
of large salaries, and reckless speculation.
In part, Mr. Payne said: .
Savings bank* are a latter-day institution.
Thl* fact is evidence that In the development
of the world'* civilisation the moral and ma
terial keep each other company and progress
to a common end. The countries that are
developing material prosperity witness the
growth of benevolent Institution's. among their
people â Institutions for the care and comfort
of the dependent and the housing of the great
army of incapable*. â¢â¢Â¦ ,. ~
An institution that encourages prudent econ
omy and provides means for the safekeeping
of savings serves a better~purpose. in induc
ing provision for ! the future, than do alms
houses for the Improvident. Viewed .in this
light savings banks cannot fall to.be regarded
as among the most beneficent of our modern
institutions. I venture to express the convlc
tion that however the people of the State may
desire to accumulate, by securing large re
turns for the use of their money, those people
eadly miss it who do not lay up In the present
as against- the 'Inevitable future. That State
misses it which fails to provide for this pur
pose by establishing savings Institutions for.
the encouragement of thrift, where savings"
may be deposited in security and the laborer
may when. the yean have gone by and tha
hand ' has lost It* cunning have recourse to a
fund provide' through sacrifice, and which
the Inducements of a well managed savings
bank have enabled, him to accumulate.
The recent wonderful development ' of our
country has made us a nation optimistic, yet
the experience of the past, with Its failures,
should not be, forgotten. Rightly utilized they
should give us accurate Judgment In place of
a cheery expectancy born of desire. And here
let' me say that, with some exceptions, â¢ and
because of the very character of 'those ex
ceptions, I the broad claim that ' our mutual or
non-capltallzed Â¦ savings banks are '- to-day - the
strongest corporations, In a comparative sense,
of all the financial institution* of our land, is
fully substantiated. It may be thought a
strong statement to say that directors of sav
ings banks should be held to the strict ac
countability of Individual trusteeship. We ad
mit that savings banks are corporations and
this would seem to absolve individual respon
sibility as incorporation usually does. But
reflection .will Â»how that this peculiar and In
dividual trusteeship, and its resulting duties,
is a verity.
To tax the deposits In savings Institutions

stocks and bonds it Is well known that pub
lished Quotation* are not reliable.
Is to discourage the placing by Â¦wage-earners
of their gains with such corporations. Not
only are the dividends which they receive les
sened by the amount of the tax paid, but the
knowledge that the earnings are to be taxed,
and thus diminished, acts as a deterrent. To
tax the accumulations of the provident poor Is
often to tax the Insurance which protects
their offspring from becoming public charges
in tho event of the death of the parents. Yet
tho Legislature of the State of New York
enacted a law the year befor last which pro
vided that every savings bank shall pay an an
nual tax equal to 1 per cent on the par value
of its surplus and undivided earnings. The
unwisdom of the enactment of this law is
evident when It Is remembered that a surplus
la created to the end that when Investments
depreciate tho depositors may receive in full
upon demand the moneys deposited, together
with tho earned dividends. It Is especially the
duty of this savings banks section to foster
a growth . of public ' opinion averse to this
phase of tax legislation. The Incumbent of
a ' savings bank receivership Is necessarily
brought into close contact with the sufferings
of deserving people, caused by Its failure,' and
is thereby deeply impressed with the absolute
necessity of throwing every possible safeguard
around their deposits.
An examination of the savings Institutions
In the State of New York that have failed re
veals three general causes of failure. As a
first general cause. I would specify the "avail
able fund" clause in many of the charters of
these failed banks, created by special legisla
tion. By "available fund" clause I mean the
Indefinite omnibus provisions of those special
charters which permitted investments other
than those especially authorized, but not ex
ceeding a fixed amount. In "such available
form as the trustee might direct."
As a second general cause of failure I
would name incompetency or carelessness In
the board of trustees. Poor advice can be had
for the asking, and indifferent or personally
weak trustees may bestow a modicum of time
or thought upon a business that brings them
little or no compensation.) . - -
As a third general cause of failure I -would
designate the element of positive dishonesty.
Yet this has appeared so Infrequently in sav
ings bank management as to Justify the be
lief that it Is less common than sporadic crime
In average humanity. Â¦

To endeavor to follow the market value from
time to time, as many public report* require,
Is also objectionable for the following reason:
It is based not upon facts, but upon opinions.
The Investment securities In question are not
fo continuously dealt in publicly as to be quot
able like produce or poultry. Even in active
To reduce bonds as soon as purchased to par
by artificially treating premiums as losses and
discounts as profits may be an easy process,
but that seems to me Its only recommendation.
A premium is simply payment in advance
for an abnormally high rate of Interest, and a
discount i* compensation in advance for an
abnormally low rate of Interest. In both cases
the compensation Is spread over the time that
the bond has still tp run; it does not apply
merely to the present day or the present half
year. By abnormal I mean differing from the
normal, the current, the fair rate of Interest
on that exact grade of security.
To discuss this motter fairly we must con
sider what this premium Is. Why do we pay
for a bond more than It calls for. or why can
we sometimes acquire it for less?
I am aware that many Institutions of high
standing state all their -bonds at par. To do
this they must necessarily have . treated the
sums paid for premiums as a loss or an ex
pense and have taken them, like other losses
from the surplus. In fact, some of them pub
lish with apparent pride the fact that "all pre
miums are at once charged to profit and Jss."
I observe that they do not say what becomes
of discounts. .
We are trustees for our depositors. A trustee
making his accounting to a surrogate or Judire
of probate Is always charged with the income
which ought to be received, and If he has not
collected It must show good cause why not
Similarly we should charge ourselves with tho
proper revenue, and the charge should .stand
until disposed of in cash or otherwise. <
I now come to a most important part of the
subject, and one on which there may be et^M
Blderable diversity of opinion.. It is the qujfiB
tlon of how we shall represent the value sf
bonds purchased at prices above or below par-
In other words, how. to dispose of premium*
and discounts.
My next suggestion Is as to the treatment
of Interest. I find that in many Instances no
regard Is paid to the accretion pf interest or
even its falling due, but it is considered null
until It takes the form of cash. I cannot heln
considering this as not the most perfect wav
for several reasons. *
A bond is, generally rpeaklng, a promise to
pay a certain principal sum at a future date
and in the meantime to pay as interest certain
periodical sums. Comparison of a large num
ber of issues shows the following tendencies:
The great majority of bonds are for a round
sum of money, payable on the first day of some
month, the interest being semi-annual and the
maturity of the bond being also on an Interest
day. There are exceptions In every one of
these particulars; some bonds are Issued tot
odd dollars and cents, some bear annual or
quarterly interest, gome pay interest on the
2d, the loth or the 2Sth of a month, some ma
ture at a date not coincident with an interest
date. It may be observed that these anoma
lies only hurt the marketability of these bonds
and thus Injure the borrower without any cor
responding advantage. The most numerous
bonds at present are 4s, January and July.
The first point on which I wish to insist is
that the bond ledger, or, to use the official
language of New York State, the "stock In
vestments" ledger, should be In a specialized
form calculated to afford on separate pages
the roost complete details as to each separate
bond investment. The ordinary double entry
ledger is totally inadequate to contain the
particulars required, though it will answer for
an aggregate account showing in condensed
form the total transactions of the kind. The
ideal arrangement. In my opinion, is a general
ledger of the broadest comprehensiveness, with
subordinate ledgers of the moÂ»t minute par
ticularity. The two opposing demands of com
prehensiveness and minuteness confront us in
all broadgauge bookkeeping, and can only be
met by a duplex system of general and special
ledgers, or systems of accounts: the former
giving statistical and the latter Individual in
fontiatlon.
As a savings bank proper is purely an In
vestment machine, the most Important branch
of its accountantcy, next to depositors' ac
counts, is that uf its Interest-bearing securi
ties. These are generally of two classes: 1.
Real estate mortgages. 2. Municipal or cor
porate Indebtedness, usually epoken of as
"bond?." From the fact that the physical
security is directly available to the mortgage
In case of default and the term Is so short
that readjustments of principal and rates of
interest can be effected directly, the former
class, real estate mortgages, require (some
what different treatment from the latter, in
which the variance between the contractual
and the market rate of Interest frequently re
suite in a premium or a discount. As either of
these branches 1s a very large subject, I will
confine myself in this paper to the securities
known as '"bonds."
interest to savings banks, the first paper
being by Colonel Charles E. . Sprague.,
president of the Union Dime Savings
Bank of New York. The topic of Colo

Since our last meeting your executive com

whether mutual or capitalized, outlining what
the new section proposed to do and soliciting
their co-operation.. We have had a large num
ber of replies and Inquiries to our letters, and
I believe to-day the American Bankers' Asso

banks having savings departments, many of
them, no doubt, due in a great degree to this
organization. I consider this a very good
showing for the first year and hope with your
assistance to have that number materially in
creased during the succeeding year. We have
bad prepared, by eome of our members papers
which they will read upon subjects of mutual
Interest. These papers will be printed in the
report of this meeting and sent to each of our
members, and many of us will have occasion
to refer to them when questions which they
cover come before us from time to time. It is
the aim of Xbe section to prepare for circula
tion such papers of mutual Interest and to
bring into closer relationship . our banks and
their officers where subjects of mutual im
portance can be discussed. It has always been
a serious question ! to me why our savings
banks have so many different methods of do

Is true In relation to our methods In the Kant,

In the right direction. We find It difficult to
instruct our depositors upon simple subjects

remedy only this email defect we would hav*
accomplished a great deal, and this would
tend to make our institutions more popular, if,
indeed, that were possible.

Fred Heinz of Io-wa Tells of Need of
Proper Legislation.
President Fred Heinz of the Farmers
and Mechanics Savings Bank of Daven
port, Iowa, presented a paper on "The
Dangers Threatening the Savings Bank*.*'
In part he said:
At present the savings banks throughout
the country are In a prosperous condition. No
doubt it Is the aim of all Interested that they
should be kept so.
The dangers that threaten the savings bank
are. In common with other banks, inefficiency
and sometimes dishonesty In the management
by those in charge on the inside, and. occa
sionally, efficiency by the non-employe* get
ting at the funds from the outside.
In addition to thin all the savings bank* ar*
threatened with a greater danger, that of los
ing desoslts if Government savings banks
BhouM be established. The agitation for
Government savings banks Is considerable, and
should ordinary savings banks fall to any great
number it would no doubt hasten the estab
lishment of Government savings banks. The
main argument in favor of Government sav
ings bankj) 1Â» that it absolutely protect* thÂ«
deposits. There are. however, many objec
tionable features. . .
To keen the present savings banks in. popu
lar favor It Is absolutely necessary that - the
greatest safeguards be provided for the safety
of the deposits. When this la done the cry for
Government savings banks will cease, other
wise not.
No doubt the best part of a savings bank
is that loans be good and kept good.
Many States have laws fixing the kind of
collateral that savings banks can Invest In.
For instance, the Iowa law permits Investment
in real estate mortgages located In the State.
Government bonds, and bonds, warrants and;
evidence* of debt Issued in the State, and a bank.
may make leans upon commercial paper, notes,
bills of exchange, drafts or any other personal
or nubile security,' but not on Its own stock.
Tne general drift of this Iowa idea is that
the securities be local securities, and that Is
the rule also In many other States and Is no
doubt a good one. for the closer the borrower
is to the lender the ea*ier It 1* to look after

We now come to the alternative Joint ac

useful and helpful to the depositors: In the

Executor's accounts should always be opened
In the name of the estate, whether they be
new accounts or transferred from the account
xf a deceased depositor, and power should be
given to. the executor to> make withdrawals: as
a general rule, when several executors are
named, the receipt of any one of them who
ha9 qualified is sufficient to bind the e3tate.

The above remarks apply to administrators*

mm 9 m * HE Century Club tendered a" re-
I ceptlon to the ladles of the bank
Â¦ ' era* convention yesterday after-
I noon at the clubhouse on Butter
street, and It proved to be a bril
liant affair. The rooms were embowered
In green boughs and gay blossoms and
music floated through the air. The
guests, among whom were many promi
nent * members of local clubs, were "re
ceived with true California hospitality by
the following charming women:
President, Mrs. Frederick O. Sanborn: past
presidents. Mrs. A. L* Bancroft. Miss Anna
Beaver. Mrs. A. F. Morrison. Mrs. P. B.
Cornwall. Mrs. John F. Merr:M. Mr*. Frank
Simms. Mrs. Frederick Hewlett. Mrs. Frank
Bowman; director*. Miss Kate Mutchinson,
Mr*. V. F. Norris. Mrs. J. K. Wilson, Mrs.
Charles Slack, Mr*. Herbert Folger, Mrs.
Louis Hengstler. Miss Caroline Van 'Dyke, Mra.
Charles E. Cooper. Mm. Timothy Hopkins,
Mrs. IX W. Montgomery and Mra. Frank Sum
ner. -
The women who thronged the rooms
for two hours were, most of them, beauti
fully gowned; notably Mrs. Timothy Hop
kins. In a seductive gray satin pompa
dour surprisingly cut with a coat effect:
Mrs. John Merrill, in a gown of black
lace; Mrs. Tripp, a guest stopping at the
Palace, from Alabama. In a gorgeous
white gown of thready lace, with a white
lace and taffeta coat and a mink hat,
lightened with milk white feathers.
The rooms have rarely looked more
beautiful than yesterday with feathery
ferns and waving grasses gracing nooks
and corners. In the main hall In a wil
derness of green a stringed orchestra dis
coursed sweet musicâ and it was not of
the insistent kind that precludes the chit
chat that o'ercomes the funereal air of
receptions â indeed, there were delightful
chats and greetings over the dainty tables
that will linger long in the memories of
the guests from over the Rockies. <
And the guests were prolific of praise
for the genuine spirit of fraternity that
prevailed in the club and that seems to
pervade the home life of women who
dwell- there. It Is an admitted fact that
the home breathes forth the personality
of the dwellerâ hence must the hospital
ity of the member be phenomenal, for the
welcome extended was of the kind that
comes from the heart and the air breath
ed It forth convincingly. The affair will
go down in the annals of the club as one
of its splendid successes.

Trade present were: J. S. Emery. E.

I cannot forbear mentioning the cordial wel

the right men to appeal to and come In touch
with the bankers of the world.
Journeying across your State I could not but
be Impressed by the conditions as compared
with the came when your pioneer father?
crossed the snowy fiierra and settled tn this
land of sunshine. I enjoj-ed every hour of the

when he said: "There la nothing to stop the

IMPRESSED BY CONDITIONS.
The response for the Bankers' Associa
tion "was delivered by C. A. Pugsley,
president of the Westchester County Na
tional Bank of Peeksvllle, N. Y-, and
Congressman from the New York Six
teenth District. He said:
I know that I voice the sentiment* of every
backer from the Atlantic to the Pacific and
from the Gulf to Canada when I eay that we
are glad to meet and greet the bankers and
citizens of California here by the Golden Gate.
I agree with Colonel Irish when he Bays that
through all the trying experiences our country
r.ts had California haa stood strongly for gold.
Our people live under greater physical com
forts than they could In any other part of
the world. The fruit crop alone nets the
State over 40,000.000 a year. We control the
raiFin crop of the worid. Our orange district,
throuph It* extended season cf production,
rhlps each year more of this luscious fruit than
any other district. Here we produce the only
pure olive oil In the United States.
Ent the best crop we raise in California Is
our crop of men and women. We Â¦welcome
you from the Cast ar.d extend to you the hos
pitality of our city and our State.
You knew, you bankers, that California was
the only part of the I'nion that during the
troublesome times of the Civil War adhered
to the told standard.
Our flowers bloom the year round. Our
weather you are now Boeing an example of is
the same !n the month cf January. We have
two seasons, the wet and dry, and we enjoy
them both.
STOOD BY GOLD STANDARD.
The Htate If remarkable for the loyalty cf

Our resources are many and varied. W ithm

Colonel John P. Irish was next intro
duced. In part he said:
This exhibit here Is no give to you, ladies
and gentlemen, a correct impression of the re
sources cf California. Our soil is fertile. As
far north as the tunny elopes of Shasta we
raise oranseg. Every day in the year we ex
j'ort something fresh from our sell. There is
no Fliniiar area of the earth's surface that
produces such varied resources :Â»Â« California.

Fame soil.
RESOURCES ABE MANY.
Groups of visitors lingered before the
various receptacles and cases containing
almost every known semi-tropical fruit
and many of the tropical variety, and
from all sides were heard exclamations
of admiration for the beautiful and wide
ly varied resources of California's solL
Large tables laden down with fresh
fruits and California made wines were
prettily decorated and the visitors en
joyed an abundance of the hospitality of
the gtate.
General X. P. Chipman. president of
the Statft Board of Trade, made a few
opealas remarks. He said:
Too who represent the banking concern* and
tYa carttal of the country should know or

You have not corr.e here to invest menev. for

Hundreds of the men of finances, their
wives and daughters, threaded in and out
the lengthy rooms and viewed with won

cf surprise were heard as each turn
brought the delighted visitors in view of

A short discussion of the papers pre

resolutions were unanimously adopted:
Kesolved. That the .T.airman appoint a
committee of three members, who are to pro
cure the complete statutory enactments re
ferring to savings banks of the various States
of the Union, and that thereafter the said com
mittee, after receiving suggestions from those
interested, proceed to prepare such a bill as.
In their opinion, would be a praper and correct
bill suitable for adoption in every State of the
Union, and that, when so prepared, the same
be submitted to the next annual convention of
this body, for further action. . â¢

banks, as existing in several States, have

A gang of tramps held up a special
freight train bound from Oakland to
Mendota last night. They boarded tha
train in a body near the Sixteenth-street
station and held up and robbed Brake
men Hill and Schroeder. and then made
their escape.
The freight was going very slow at thÂ«
time and the hobos had little difficulty
In getting aboard. They surprised the
crew, but hurriedly made their departure
as soon as they had robbed the two brake
men. The police have* been notified, but
have no clew to the Identity of the rob
bers.
L.ucius Teter. cashier of the Chicago
Savings Bank of Chicago, read a most in
teresting paper on "Savings Bank Adver
tising" and the best methods of keeping
a savings bank before the minds of the
general public.
â¢ I would therefore movt you, Mr. Chairman,
that you appoint a committee of three, not
including the mover, who are to get the com
plete statutory enactments as to the govern
ment of savings^ banks of the various States

same would be submtted to thÂ« next annual

Such a bill, wherever enacted by the law
makers, would add to the popularity of the

Mr. McMurray said he hoped the vis
itors would take advantage of the facili
ties tendered them to travel over tbe
whole of the State from Slskiyou to San
Diego and instead of six days, he begged
them to extend their visit to six weeks.
He also took the opportunity to tell them
that all civic and commercial bodies of
California were eager to give them a
royal . welcome. He begged that since
they had come so far they might re
main longer and view the great State of
which they have read so much.
Frank Symracs, and William McMurray
were among other speakers of the even
ing, v
Governor Parde brought his remarks to
a close with renewed expressions of
heartfelt greeting. In the name of the
people of the State he told of the pleas
ure that the visit of the. American Bank
ers' Association had afforded them while
they desired everywhere to extend to
their distinguished visitors the most cor
dial welcome. Â¦
. After the repast Governor Pardee gave
the visitors a hearty, sincere and patri
otic welcome to the land of friHt, flowers

ing and describing the remarkable ad
vantages to be enjoyed in California, told
his interested hearers of her dimensions
and reminded them with a genial and
kindly invitation that there was room for
the people ofthe East, who would be wel
comed whenever they came here In great

mountains and her valleys, her vineyards
and her orchards, and her horticultural
and floricultural wealth. No floods, no,
typhoons were known here, said Governor
Pardee, to bring devastation, and, he
said, no sunstroke hampered and laid low
the man who labored on the street or in
the field. It was a State where extreme
Climatic drawbacks were unknown, and
with all such advantage he wondered why

Clark "Williams, vice president of the
United States Mortgage and Trust Com
pany, of New York, followed with a con
cise paper on "The Business of TruBt
Companies Compared With the Business
of Clearing Banks." Sir. Williams show
ed that the business In the. last twelve
months of forty-nine trust companies In
Greater New York amounted to $741,000,
000. compared to r $Si4,000,009 handled by
the clearing banks of- that section. He
declared that a point in favor of the trust
companies was proven by the fact that
the checks drawn on the trust companies
of Greater New York for the x last year
amounted to $4,000,000,000, while checks
drawn on the clearing banks of that sec
tion amounted to $74,000,000,000. This, the
Epcaker claimed, showed that the public
was 'satisfied to allow its funds to re
main on deposit with the trust companies.
A five-minute talk of delegates followed
the reading of the papers and Clark Wil
liams suggested that steps be taken to
enlarge the membership of the trust com
pany section of the Bankers' Association
and that uniform laws be secured In the

Next Is one somewhat more In vog;ue a few
years ago than at present: Some wonderful
El Dorado, needing only a few dollars for de
velopment to make its shareholders â¢"rich be
yond the dream of avarice," or some embryo
Standard Oil Company needing a small amount
to Gig a hole In the ground and enrich the
rest of th* world; some such enterprise is capi
talized'by philanthropists who desire, out of
love for their fellow-man, to let him iri on a
good thing by selling him a few shares of
treasury stock at 10 cents on the dollar (going
to 20 cents next week); being philanthropists,
or perhaps because they know each other too
well, they do not ask that the money shall be
paid to themselves direct, but to a trust com
pany, who will hold the stock in escrow and
deliver it as sold.
Seriously, gentlemen, I do not mean to Inti
mate for one moment that all enterprises
brought out in this way. through the Inter
mediary services of a trust company, are of
the character sketched above: far from it. But
I do want to point out the dangerous features
of this kind of escrow and to show the need
of very great caution when such a proposition
Is brought to us. One particular objection to
thU form of escrow Is the very real responsi
bility put upon the trust comuany.
In the State of New York, and I believe in
most others, a company cannot issue its own
stock for less than par; euch stock la often
gold, rightly and properly so. by owners who
have received the stock at par for property pur
chased, and in other Kays; but when a trust
company accepts payments for so-called treas
ury stock it should be very sure of the bona
fldeÂ» of the proceedings; should have a very
intimate and exact knowledge of the transac
tion â¢ shoura. In fact, be prepared to accept
thÂ« moral responsibility entailed as being a very
rÂ«al end legal responsibility; and that. I opine,
is outeide the proper functions of a trust com-
In this form of escrowMhere !s always
the danger of the trust Â¦ company belns held
liable for representations and promises con
tained In circulars an* prospectuses, even when
Us sen-Ices' have been limited to distributing
such papers. One or two recent cases in the
New York courts illustrate this danger.

such rxart of the consideration as may txÂ»
&Â«reeÂ»i u:>cn, umaUjr to become forfeited it
he fails to carry &"t his part of tha agree
m<r.t when the proper time arrive*.
I need oniy point rut In this connection
that care should ba takÂ»n. In such an escrow,
that the position of the trust con-pany does
not become one cf stakeholder, sln'.-e a stake
holder must dec!d? whether an a^rreemÂ»nt has
been properly rarriert cut p.nd be the sole
Judge of Its fulfillment or nonfullillment. an
entirely unnecessary and undesirable position
for the trust comivany, unwarranted by any
charge It could reasonably make lor its ser
vices. I venture t<Â» *ugxe*i. therefore, t&at
in such escrows (and perhaps In all escrow*)
the Instructions to the trust companiee should
be In writing and signed by all parties to the
agreement. If either the Erantor or prantee
refuse to Jcln in Fuch Instructions the trust
company simply Fits still end permits them to
ficht it out; If made a party to any suit it
Bdmtts the fact? of which It ha? knowledge
and prays the honorable court to instruct It
as to Its (the. court's) wishes, counsel usually
asking for a proper allowance to cover their
duties in the premises. Such is the simple
escrow.
This definition and explanation cover the
strict legal use of th? word, but It ia com
mcnly the practice In trust company work to
carry under th!^ head various forms of busl-
Vfss which, prihaps. do not conform absolutely
with this strict legal definition, and yet which
Justify my sub-title and are propsrly within
the Eeooe of trJÂ£t company function*.
The simple form of escrow, and perhaps
the most common, in the one of our dellnltion:
The dictionary define* an escrow as: "An
inctruzKcm under seal, placed in tbe bands
of a third person for delivery to the grantee
en tome condition, the instrument being of
no effect until cellvery." Wack'* IÂ«aw Dic
tionary enlarges this definition by stating: "A
irrant may be deposited by the grantor with a
third pfrson. to be delivered on the perfor
mance cf a condition, ar.d on delivery by >he
depositary it win tp.fce effect. While in the
I>ossees!on of a third and subject to
condition, it is called an "escrow." "

BANKS PREPARE

THE first session of the annual

t^^BBIIHI>B>B9i>i{9L^lB[ISiBiSZlL^BSlS9BDâ¢-> OMETHING of the extent of our interests in
the maintenance of open markets in China is
disclosed by a recent publication of the Bureau
of Statistics of the Department of Commerce* and
Industry. The publication reviews our trade with
China from 1875 down to the close of the last fiscal
year and shows that while the trade is by no means
so extensive as it should be, yet the rate of progress
has been so rapid as to assure an extensive commerce
with China in the immediate future should the "open
door" be maintained.
In a summary of the growth of our trade the bulle
tin of the bureau says: "Taking our figures of com
merce with China the growth in exports to that
country has been from $1,101,383 in 1880 to $2,046,209
in 1890, $15,259,167 in 1900 and $18,603,369 in I903.
The figures prior to 1880 cannot be given in satisfac
tory form because prior to that time gold and silver
were included in the statement of exports to China,
and as the shipments of silver to China were fre
quently large the figures if quoted would be mis
leading so far as relates to commerce in merchandise.
In 1002 the United States occupied fourth place in
the list of countries from which China drew its im
ports. The total from the United States in that year
was 30,138,713 . Haikwan taels; from Great Britain,
57,624,610 Haikwan taels; India, 33,037,439 Haikwan
taels, and from Japan, 35,342,283 Haikwan taels."
A clearer presentation of the development of our
Chinese' trade and fts relation to the whole volume
of imports into that country is given in the following
table:

The details and dates of forthcoming ex

United States Court Commissioner
Heacock yesterday discharged from cus
tody D. N. Bartholdi of Jerome, Arizona,
who was arrested by United States Se
cret Service Agent Hazen on a charge of
conspiring to have counterfeit currency
manufactured.
Bartholdi made overtures to several en
gravers in this city to engrave the fac
simile of an Austrian 50-crown bank note
in the center of a certificated mining
stock. As no confederate could be found
Judge Heacock said that the prisoner
could not be held on the conspiracy
charge, and that while the court was con
vinced that Bartholdi had attempted to
have the counterfeit notes made he could
not be held, because Congress had failed
to enact a law prohibiting and punishing
attempts to counterfeit money.
Bert Schlesinger argued the case on
ber-alf of the prisoner.
Bartholdi of Arizona Escapes Because
Congress Has Failed to Enact
Necessary Legislation.
THERE was a chance for much friction be
tween the United States and the Dominion of
Canada over the Alaskan boundary. The
(^ULstion was undoubtedly somewhat clouded by the
uct that the original boundary convention between
Kussia and Great Britain was made at a time when
but little value was known in Alaska beyond the furs
yielded by its wild animals. A few square miles
more or less made but Little difFerence, and there was
some uncertainty of metes and bounds. This was
helped on by the lack of knowledge of the geography
of the country, and ignorance of the latitude and
longitude.
When the uncertainty of the boundaries of Loui
siana territcry was suggested to Bonaparte he said:
"If there were no uncertainties it would be necessary
to create some." Out of the uncertainty of the in
clusion of Texas in the treaty of *^5an Ildefonso
finally came our war with Mexico, in which we settled
far more than the Louisiana boundary. In that epi
sode we had before us, as had Great Britain, the
malign possibilities of a boundary dispute. We went
near to war with her over the Oregon boundary, and
avoided it only by the wisdom of Polk, who foresaw
the struggle with Mexico and clearly comprehended
the impolicy of making England her ally by a threat
ening policy on the northern border.
There be those who assail the statesmanship of
Polk by pointing out that if he had stood on "54
degrees 40 minutes or fight" we would have now the
whole west coast. But that is like all after thoughts.
It ?s undeniable that by dropping the Oregon line to
49 degrees he removed all uncertainty from the result
of the Mexican war and gave us an accession of ter
ritory hardly less effective in its influence upon our
rational life than the acquisition of Louisiana..
The contention of the Dominion of Canada in re
gard to the Alaskan boundary was pushed to an un
warrantable extreme by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the
Canadian Premier. His position and his backing by
the French party enabled him to raise the expectation
Of his people up to the level of his extraordinary
claims. Wbtn the High Commission first attempted
to settle the boundary his position made an accom
modation impossible. Inspired by him, attacks upon
the United States were made in the Dominion Par
liament, and a condition of great heat was developed
in Canada, and continued in spite of the efforts of
conservatives like John Charlton to induce a more
reasonable view. The discovery of gold, coal and
ether resources in Alaska, far in excess of its origi
nal value as a fur country, and the consequent im
portance given to its commerce and to its eligible
harbors, lifted the matter far above the views that
were held when the Russian delimitation was made.
The High Commission having failed to adjust the
differences, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier remaining obdu
rate, international conference was resorted to, with
Lord Alverstone, Chief Justice of Great Britain, as
virtual umpire. It was a solemn conference, because
in ill boundary disputes there is tha germ of armed
conflict. Canada sent her ablest men to sustain her
contention, and the United States met them with
equal ability. But a great Englishman sat as umpire.
Upon him was the great pressure of imperial inter
ests. Canada, an important part of the empire, was
determined, and perhaps the question of her future
loyalty was involved. The hazy uncertainty of the
whole issue gave a margin within which, without in
curring criticism, Lord Alverstone could lean to the
side of imperial prestige. This element in the ar
l:itration gave it the great uncertainty which adds
rest to the consideration of large matters.
Lord Alverstone's conduct of the hearing was ir
reproachable. He showed a keen knowledge of the
legal and physical features that were in debate, and at
every point was the essence of fairness and impar
tiality. At the close he concurred with the Ameri
can arbitrators and gave us a judgment which wins
for the United States every one of our substantial
and important contentions. While it is human na
ture, perhaps, that the Canadian members of the court
not only refused their signatures to the findings but
even left the court in dudgeon before the decree was
signed, yet it would have been better to have pre
pared their minority judgment and filed it as a digni
fied expression of their dissent.
The action of Lord Alverstone rises to a moral
height that will greatly impress this country and pro
foundly and favorably affect the sentiment of our
people. It gives an encouragement to all courts in
the civilized world, and renews the confidence of
mankind in the survival to our day of the highest
principles of justice.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The awakening of California municipalities is not'
confined to the communities mentioned by the
Union. Indeed, it is not feasible to make a list,
of them all with allusion to their various moves.
Space docs not permit. It is noticeable that the idea
of concerted action is dominant in interior and coast
cities alike. Tulare has just celebrated the success
achieved by a "pull all together" to free itself from
the incubus of bonds Â£hat has so long weighed it
down.
Placcrville. in El Dorado County, the land where
California gold was originally discovered, is stirring
to organize a board of trade. "Providence and the
outside world," so remarks the El Dorado Republi
can, "generally assist those who first succeed in help
ing themselves. It will not do much good to expa
tiate on the values of local investments unless we do
something ourselves to develop the opportunities."
The Republican believes a board of trade is needed to
have the advantages of El Dorado County become
better known.
Descending from the mountains and going down
to the coast the observer finds the people of Santa
Cm* to be of the same mind. The Board of Trade
of Santa Cruz, declares the Sentinel, "has been re
juvenated, and this brings joy. to the members." No
election had been held. for. officers since (i8oi until
recently. At the first meeting a committee was ap-.
pointed to prepare literature with reference to the
city .and also the county of Santa Cruz. The Santa
Cruz Board of Trade resumes activity with a mem
bership of 135 leading citizens. The ranks will be
recruited and the effect will be good.
The Ontario Record tells of the efforts to give On
tario a chamber of commerce. Five men secured
thirty new applicants within forty-eight hours. The
Ontario Record favors giving the chamber of com
merce a plan of organization similar to that of the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, which has been
a potent factor in acquainting the world with South
ern California.
Pasadena, having created a system of finely im
proved and beautiful streets, is devoting its resources
to providing a sewer system. Los Angeles is to ex
pend a sum relatively as large as that voted by the
people of San Francisco. San Jose, .Santa Rosa and
Fresno are noted by the Union as being included in
the march of progress.
"There ought to be a suggestion in these several
movements, for Sacramento," says the Union. "No
city in California stands in greater need of municipal
development than our own and none is better able
to meet the cost. Interest rates are low. Every dol
lar for a reasonable bonding scheme could be, easily
provided at home. The time is ripe in every way for
action that would put this city on its feet in a new
and good fashion and establish conditions which
have been the dream of every Sacramentan of pro
gressive spirit since time out of mind."
THE intention of California cities and towns to
better their material conditions has never been
more- 1 marked than it is now. This fact fur
nishes a text for the Sacrarnento' Union. Thomas
Rickard's plans for the development of Berkeley, the
university city, on a liberal scale, are cited. San Fran
cisco is declared to have led the way with its deter
mination to authorize the issue of bonds for va
rious improvements to cost $17,000,000 in round fig
ures. . â¢ Â¦Â¦'.'Â¦' >\''^v!v.-^i;

ISO one may say now with justice that American
methods are not proof against the world, even if the
Ingenuity of the nations be made in conspiracy
against us. Even in Russia, the last fortress to hold
out against the assault of novelty and invention, they
have had a taste of railway train robbery that com
pares very favorably with the best we can do./
Following the morning session luncheon
was served by. the ladles of the church
in the Sunday school room, which was
decorated for the occasion.
. The afternoon session of the convoca
tion was opened bv' an address by the
Rev. N. B. W. Gallwey., The general
sVfbject of the Rev. Mr. Gallwev's ad
dress was, "Are ' We Ready for Church
Expansion in the City?" and In the course
of his remarks told df the great amount
of money that has' been spent in this city
during the last twelve years on the
building and repairing of churches. Dr.
Gallwey strongly maintained that bene
fits and subscriptions for missions should
be thought of after completion of work
to be done on home churches.
Other addresses of the afternoon were
made by the Right Rev. W. F. Nichols,
D. D.: George E.- Butler and the Rev. B.
M. Weeden of St. Luke's Church.
. Several small business matters were dis
cussed, when the session adjourned.
The evening session of the convocation
was held in the church proper and the
evening prayer was sung the united
choirs of San Francisco, followed by an
address by the bishop of the diocese.
The address was both' eloquent and stir
ring and dealt on the necessity of Chris
tians shouldering the responsibility placed
upon them by civilization. Among other
things the speaker said:
"Taking into consideration all that civ
ilization stands for at Its bestâ order, lib
erty, Justice, humanity and all that it
has to off erâ there , can be no hesitation
about saying that at its very best civil
ization leaves an aching heart without
religion." .
The fall convocation of the San Fran
cisco district of the Episcopal church was
held in the library of Trinity Churcli
yesterday and last night and was at
tended by a 'large number of laymen,
clergymen and members of the church.
The convopation sermon was preached
by the Rev. Charles Gardner of StaiT
ford University, who chose for tha sub
ject or lijs text "Civilization and Relig
ion."
The board has prepared a resolution
which will be adopted at its next meet
ing: ordering the obstructions on Lyon
street to be removed and also serving no
tices on the Presidio and Ferries Rail
road Company > and R. Hermann to re
move their objectionable structures with
in ten days.
The Board of Supervisors has already
purchased the Miranda grant for $6500, so
Lyon street may be extended and It Is
now the duty of the Board of Works to
proceed with the work. . â¢
The location of the obstructions has
been determined by survey by City Engin
eer Grunsky. In making the survey the
monuments placed by the War Depart
ment along the easterly line of the Pre
sidio reservation as fenced have been
taken as defining the westerly line* of
Lyon street. This line deflects easterly
from the course of the section of Lyon
street south of Pacific avenue. The de
flected line was held to be correct by the
Supreme Court.
There Is eome question as to whether the
two small storage sheds to the northward
of Lewis street are not on land that has
never been dedicated to public use as a
street. The City Engineer says In a re
cent report that they may stand on land
sold as "salt marsh and tide land" by the
State of California. .
The principal obstructions, the removal
of which will be ordered by the Board of
Works, are on Lewis and Tonquin streets
at points where Lyon street would Inter
sect. These are principally, an abandoned
car shed owned by the Union-street road
and part of inclosed property known as
Harbor View baths and in possession of
R. Hermann.
Cornmisls'oner Casey of the Board of
Public Works and Deputy J. B. Gartland
made a visit of Inspection yesterday to
the northern end of Lyon street, prelim
inary to the beginning of proceedings to
open the thoroughfare and to cause tho
removal of obstructions thereon.'
From all that can be learned Plllsbury
had no troubles other than those men
tioned. He had but recently entered upon
the duties of Yosemite Valley agent of
the Santa Fe Company and waa filling the
billet in a most satisfactory manner to
the railroad officials. He was well liked
by his associates in the office, one of
whom was his roommate at the Russ.
To the latter he gave not the slightest
intimation of his intended departure from
the city. "Without even collecting the two
months' salary that was coming to him.
Plllsbury quietly left the company's of
fice one Friday afternoon. The last seen
of him was the Sunday following, when
a friend greeted him at the ferry. He
then had bis telescope bag with him, and
presumably was embarking on the new
life he had so often referred to.
Tte- officials of the Santa Fe hav*
abandoned their search for Frank Pins
bury. Yosemite Valiey agent for the corn
ipany. who disappeared rather mysterious
ly about two weeks ago. It was at first
thought that the young roan had wan
dered off while his mind wag temporarily
unbalanced, or that he had met with some
mishap. Facts have since developed that
plainly suggest that Pill3bury planned hiÂ«
departure from the city. A careful Inves
tigation of his trunk, left In his room at
the Russ House, shows that he removed
from It underwear, a khaki suit, a shav
ing outfit and other necessities. These he
packed in a telescope basket, purchased
before his departure. He was seen at
the ferry, buying a ticket for Oak
land, two days after he disappeared from
the company's office. He had been talk
ing a great deal about locating timber
land and leading a secluded life and the
opinion now prevails at the Santa Fe of
fice that he has bone into the interior for
the purpose of carrying out this plan.
The suspicion of the former associates
of Plllsbury in the Santa Fe office Is
shared by 'the friends of the young man
along the street. To the latter he had
often remarked, since the death of his
wife and child about a year ago. that he
would prefer to enter upon the life of a
recluse than to continue on in what he
was pleased to term the "ever monoton
ous drudge of wage-earning." It was ap
parent that the loss of his wife and child
had made him discontented with life as It
is experienced In the large cities and he
longed to escape It and live closer to na
ture In the forests.
MR. LANE is an amiable and able candidate,
but we fear that his zeal sometimes goes
down the backstretch ahead of his discretion.
The spicing of his meetings with red pepper,' which
he charges to Mayor Schmitz, may be responsible
for some of the lurid visions he sees and so faith
fully describes to his audiences. We desire to do him
the justice of saying that we think the city would
survive his administration as Mayor if he could be
elected, and so it would that of either of his oppo
nents, even if they are bad as his -forebodings paint
them. Neither of the candidates is a buccaneer, but
this is a Republican city, and Republicans naturally
desire to be responsible for its government, and they
will resent being told that they, the majority, are un
fit for that responsibility.
Mr. Lane has recently introduced his entire and ex
cellent family into the campaign, finding that neces
sary to prove that he does not belong to the Bohe
mian Club. We i\eed not look far among our ac
quaintances lo find some who belong to the Bohe
mian Club who are not suspected of sinister de
signs upon the public treasury and who also have
families that they love and care for. Mr. Lane setÂ» (
up men of straw who denounce him for belonging
to clubs in which he has no membership in order
that he may exalt his domestic virtues. Now we
know he has those virtues, but he has no monopoly
of them in this city, as we beg to assure him! He
and his partisans have made it lively for Mayor
Schmitz by pointing to the money that is being
spent in his campaign. Schmitz is a trifle sumptuous
in the banner line. But as he also claims that he is
the only man who can save the imperiled city, surely
from his standpoint no expense is too great if. in
curred in saving the city from Lane.
When two men run for the same officÂ«, with the
same conception of their importance and the same
views about municipal salvation, both money and
fur are apt to fly. But Mr. Lane has Christopher
Columbussed a discovery- In a speech in which he
pointed to the vast sums which his fancy sees being
spent like water in the campaign to beat him, he
suggested their derivation by declaring that the
Mayor can easily make $500,000 a year out of this
city by judicious assessment of the red light district
and the saloons.
Like Robert, Lord Give, in his robbery of the
Begums, Mr. Lane should wonder at his modera
tion. Does he not know that the Mayor could make
one hundred millions by robbing the Mint, the sub
treasury and the banks? .Why arrest the flight of his
dirigible balloon of oratory at a paltry half-million
when there is so much more in sight and in just as
much danger from the Mayor? Why imagine peanuts
under such circumstances? Doesn't he know that
the Mayor could dynamite The Call building and
take a torch in his red right and official hand and
burn the whole town? The kind of Mayor 'he fears
may be elected could- easily leave only Russian.
Rincon and Telegraph hills standing above the
charred remains of the city.' When Mr. Lane does
his political thinking and pj-opels his ambition on
the push cart of his imagination, why doesn't he make
a clean job of it?
He should remember that the Bankers' Associa
tion is in town, and not impress our visitors too
strongly with our impending doom. He knows the
classics and is aware that there were kings before
Agamemnon, and there arc people here who insist
upon believing tlfat there were honest men before
Lane and that there will be some left after he quits
seeking office.
One noticeable element in his canvass is his re
peated declaration that we should not have a business
man for Mayor! His own party as it used to be
eleeted Washington Bartlett Mayor, a business man,
and succeeded him with another, Mr. E. B. Bond.
They were nothing but business men, and though
their party was then in the grip of a most offensive
boss system* they gave to the city a high order of
administration because they were business men and
not politicians.
The Republican party has no boss here and no boss
system, and has nominated a . . business man for
Mayor and intends to use its majority to elect him,
just to show its mettle and to prove its devotion to
the interests of San Francisco. Mr. Lane should not
out-Jeremiah Jeremiah, for already the opinion, is
abroad that he doth protest too much.

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL; WEDNESDAY^ OCTOBER 21, 1903.
Â£ Â£ O"f HUNDRED yards distant rusty masses of ironstone preceded
f I an undulation in the flat country, and toward the base of one
I tall block Lord Winstone descried an object which made him
JL rub his eyes with frank amazement.
"Near the foot oPthe rock, his back against it, and shadowed entirely
from the' sun's light by a natural grotto in the stone, sat an enormous
man or ape. Its stature was colossal, though smaller by far than
the natives of Mapora had described; its naked body was bright ercen;
its hands were folded over its breast; its misshaped head was bent for
ward, and wild, snaky hair, also of vivid green, fell luxuriantly around it,
while pressed upon its crown was a wreath of flowers.
"In the midst of this stranee kingdom, silent, motionless and alone,
with uncouth face and distorted limbs, reigned this huge green monster
in mortal shape.
"Lord Winstone got out his field glasses, without which he never
hunted, and trained them on the grotto. He r'ired awhile, and then his
breath left his lungs in a gasp of surprise, as he returned the glasses to
their case and pushed forward."
Without doubt the reader will gasp with equal amazement and no less
curiosity that such strange things can exist even in the Africa of to-dav.
but Eden Philpotts knows absolutely whereof he speaks when he made
the great Elephant Spirit of the Dark Continent one of the bic features
of his new novel. "The Golden Fetich," now running in the Sunday Call,
the second installment of which will be published next Sunday. It gives
you Africa as it really is now and as it has not been shown since the
wonderful explorations of the ereat Stanley.
But unbelievable as the foregoing extract may seem, stranger things
are being found right here at home. Look in the next Sunday Call for
"Fitch's Mine of Mystery." It tells of the discovery under the very
feet of civilization in California, only a few months ago. of a m:ne of
fire that has utterly baffled the best scientists in the world. Chunks of
this wonderful mineral that has a flame which cannot be destroyed have
been taken from Fitch's mine, ground into powder, assayed bv every
known process, tested by every possible standard, and still it remains a
mysteryâ and still it clows on with undiminished brightness. It cannot
be destroyed and it cannot be extinguished. Wonderful as is the newlv
discovered radium, of which there is less than one pound in the whole
world and which costs a fabulous sum for a single ounce. Fitch s new
mineral is even more astounding and by far more puzzling. And to
think that the earth in California is just full of it. butâ read next Sun

The venerable former United States
Senator James L Pugh, who haa made
his home In Washington since his retire
ment, says that he came near being called
to a personal account and having: to fight
because In Alabama years ago during a
campaign he called a Democratic bolter
a "heredic." That Is quite a common
word In many portions of the South. Mr.
Pugh does not exactly know how It orig
inated, but it is applied to yearling cattle
that have not been branded or marked
by their owners. A strange thing Is that
such beasts are looked upon by the other
cattle as aliens, and they will not permit
them to enter the pens for food during
the winter months, but bite them savagely
if they try to. He thinks that possibly
the word was corrupted by negroes who
had heard of "heretics" in the religious
sense. The alien cattle on account of ex
posure have long hair and are such un
kept creatures that perhaps some of the
darkeys may have primarily called them
"hairy Dicks," and later the word got
to' be- "heredic."
What a "Heredic" Is.
An unusual amount of Interest was cen
tered In this meeting because the dele
gates from this district to the Democratic
nominating convention were pledged for
D. I. Mahoney for Mayor and durirlg the
deliberations of the convention they de
termined that the best interests of the
party In the city would be best subserved
by uniting as a party for the earnest sup
port of Mr. Lane as Mayor.
The large attendance last night' was
taken ejs a testimonial that the Democrat
ic voters approve of the action of the
delegates to the convention.
William Hoff Cook acted as chairman
of the meeting. Others who spoke were
Edward Godchaux. John Connor, H. U.
Brandcnstein and Harry Wilbur.
â¢ Last night Franklin K. Lane addressed
a- large audience of voters of the Thirty
ninth Assembly District at Richmond Hall
corner of Fourth avenue and Clement
street. His remarks were received with
favor and he was frequently Interrupted
with applause. He made a great hit with
his audience when he referred to the
names of the president of the United
States, and he paid a high tribute to
President Roo3evelt when he stated that
he so respected the honesty and Integrity
of the chief executive of the nation that
he would be willing to leave the selection

The Mayor next addressed a meeting
at Franklin Hall, on Fillmore street, near
Bush. His speech was the same as the
one previously delivered at Steimke Hall.
The last and most enthusiastic meet-
Ing of the evening was held In Maen
rerbtmd Hal!, corner of Twenty-fourth
street and Potrero avenue. Schmitz's
voice was hoarse and he contented him
self with saying a few words along his
chosen lines.
I have risen from the ranks of the plain
people and I am still willing to serve them as
their obedient servant. I believe the people
of San Francisco know what is right, and will
do what is right on the 3d of November. If
elected I will do' everything in my power to
build up a bigger, greater city than we now
have, and make her not only the queen of
the Pacific, but one of the finest cities in the
United States.
The fight is between myself end Crocker.
Lane has not a possible chance, and is not to
be considered in the fight, except that he will
try to take as many votes away from the
Labor party as he can. and thus help Crocker.
Two years ago I was practically an un
known man. I made pledges to the people
and they elected me. I have carried out these
pledees as far as was In my power. I have
worked for the whole people and not for any
one class. I care not for having my name In
th* headlines of the newspapers. The only
thing that I want is to have It written in the
hearts of the people. Do not listen or pay
any attention to the lying newspapers and the
lying circulars that are being distributed.
The city Is In the heart of a prosperity un
heard of before. It Is not good business to
change this system, when things are running
along so smoothly. Le't the city prosper as
it has done; let the government be for all
and not for any one c!aÂ«s.

we w?re doing two years ago â dividing the

In wounds of the heart itself the es
cape of blood is never in large quantities
and the lethal consequences are due to the
fact that the escape of blood from within
Its cavity (or cavities) Into the surround
ing sac of the pericardium mechanically
interrupts the alternate contraction and
expansion by which its pumping action 13
maintained. * Accordingly the results of
wounds of the heart are usually identical
with those of gradual suffocation. This
fact was strikingly demonstrated in the
case of the Empress of Austria. And the
diabolic skill and precision with which the
wound was inflicted in her case offer a
diagrammatic illustration of a necessarily
fatal wound of the heart. The Instrument
used was too large to form a mere "needle
puncture"; it was inflicted too high in
the chest to be "non-penetrating," for it
was aimed with truly fiendish ingenuity
at the position of one of the thin-walled
of the four cavities of the heart and the
directness of the penetration, combined
with the thinness of the wall of the cav
ity, rendered it physically impossible that
the wouril could be "valvular." The
Israelite warrior of old smote the enemy
âwhen possibleâ "beneath the fifth rib,"
because the Impulse of the heart is .felt
there. But he probably did not know
that it Is in that precise position that a
wound of the' heart is least necessarily
fatal. The Italian assassin of recent date
displays Incomparably greater skill and
knowledge. The science of Jhe present
day also proves that the historic account
of the death of Admiral Vlllneuve is open
to skeptical doubt. And the recent cases
of suture of the heart give illustration
that modern surgical skill may attempt,
and with success, the seemingly. Impossi

PORT OF SPAIN, Island of Trinidad,
Oct. 20.-Jackson H, Ralston of

sion at Caracas, Venezuela, has decided
against Venezuela in the case of the
Government's claim for the double pay
ment of local taxes, which decision ap
plies In principle to the attempts now be

ment to collect a second payment of
taxes on goods Imported at Ctudad Boli

that taxpayers were protected by the pay

attention to the Castine case, decided by

NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â John Alexander
Dowle, arrayed in evening dress, talked
for two hours to-night before a great
throng In Madison Square Garden, the
burden of his talk being denunciation of
the clergy and the press.
When he began the huge garden was
crowded and the 'police say 6000 persons
who could not gain entrance were turned
away. In a half hour, however, the
crowd began to surge out and then the
police refused to admit any late comers,
saying they feared a riot. The speaker
was repeatedly Interrupted with hisses
and shouts of disapproval. At one point
Dowle ordered the police to arrest two
men In different parts of the building who
had Interrupted him.
Carrie Nation, who occupied a seat
near the front, asked "Elijah" to an-
Bwer some questions. He refused and
ordered her to sit down. Dowie then
praised the spirit In which Mrs. Nation
had warred on the saloons, but said she
used wrong methods. Mrs. Nation again
demanded the privilege of asking ques
tions. At once Zlon guards surrounded
her and with the help of several police
men ejected her.
At this several hundred persons at the
back of the garden made a rush to get
out. The entrance was blocked in a mo
ment, and Dowie. shouting that the way
had been blocked by the crowd outside,
brought there for the purpose of creating
a disturbance, ordered the Zionists to
keep their places. He then requested the
audience" to be seated, and, after hav'ing
the side exits opened, he requested the
audience -to rise in sections and go out
at the sides.
Rev. Charles Parkhurst sent the fol
lowing open letter to Dowle:
I do not want to bo presuming, but doubt
If it Is any more preaupmtuous In me to come
and try to clarify you than it Is for you to
come and. trv to clarify New York, and I do
not know which of us has taken the heavier
contract. I attended your service at Madison
square Garden last evening; p.nd I went de
termined to enjoy it if I could be benefited by
It and po away and refute some of the charges
that I had heard alleged against you. But It
was of no use; your behacior on the platform
crushed every throb of sympathy I had with
you.. 1 never'heard from a public speaker such
& dlscharre of effervescent wrath and coarse
invective. I went to hear you preach the gos
pel and you preached Dowle, Zion City, "stlnl:
pot." I was ashamed of you and almost
ashamed to be in your audience. It was a
Ion* way below the standard even of the cir
cuses that I have attended In the same garden.
The only consolation I could derive was that It
was bo abominable and bo far beyond the
bounds of respectability that even those In
your congregation who did not know what
Christianity is would have no idea that it had
anything to do with what you were saying.
Of course, the ridiculousness of the perform
ance was only enhanced by the Immensity of
your pretensions. If you claimed to be only
an ordinary man there might ba some hope for
you, even with what you call the "rabble."
but the rabble Is discriminating and can dis
criminate as keenly as the keenest between a
prophet and a Juggler, between an Elijah and
a mountebank.

His first appearance was at Steimke
Hall, corner cf Union and Octavla streets.
The meeting was given under the aus
pices r>f the Sehmitz Central Club. J. A.
Devoto presided and made the introduc
tory remarks. Schmitr in brief said:
Mayor Schmitr spoke at three political
meetingE last night, large crowds greet
ing him at each hall.

N^w. that election Is drawing near. It
may be of interest to note the names of
the members of the various boards and
commissions who will eever their connec
tion with the municipal government on
January 9, 1S04, because the terms for
vhlch they were appointed will expire on
that date. The political complexion of
the commissions will be materially af
fected according as the successful candi
date for Mayor will be either Crocker.
Lane or Sehmltr.
The new chief executive of the city,
w hoever he may be, will have the ap
pointment of no less than eleven com
missioners next January and an addi
tional eleven In January. 1905- Th*
names of those who will retire from
office at the end of the present year are:
Marsden Manson. Board of Public
"Works: P. H. McCarthy. Civil Service
< 'ommlysion : Lawrence F. Walsh, Board
of Education; Thomas Reagan, Police
Commission; Rolla V. Watt, Fire Com
mission; A. B. Spreckels. Jasper Mc-
Donald, Park Commission; Â£>r. R. W.
I'aum. Dr. V. P. Buckley. Board of
Hralth: Jeremiah DfÂ»apy, Oliver Everett,
Klectlon Commission.
' Should Dr. Licwitt resign from the
Health Board, as he has Intimated he
v.-0'Jld, there would be another vacancy
to fill.
A number of Fubordlnates not under
c:\il service will have their tenure
jeopardized hy the election of a new
Mayor. The four-year term of Registrar
Thomas J. VÂ»'r.lsh will expire on January
I next, pnd unless he Is able to secure
the votes of a majority of the Election
Commission hÂ« will have to make way
for his successor.
Nicholas JortalTs position as secretary
of the Board of Public Works will depend !
l.-srsely on who will be the next Mayor.
If Schmiti is re-elected the new Com
miesioner would combine with the j
Mayors brother, also a Commissioner. \
p.nd Casey would be a hopeless minority, j
Casey would then probably be deposed
hs president of the Board of Public
Works, although he would still continue
Â¦ member thereof. As Casey is JortalKs
'riend. it Is easy to see what would hap
pen In the latter's case. If Crocker
1* elected JortalTs tenure would de
pend on whether the new Commissioner
vould combine with Herbert Schmltz or
Â«'asey. If no combination were made
Ji.rtall would be safe at least for another
year. Of course a large number of other
positions, including that of City Engineer
Grtmsky and City Architect Cuthbertson,
v.ill hinge on the personality of the new
Mayor.
The same is true of the Board of
Health. If Schmltz is elected he will
have the votes of Drs. Stlnson. Ward,
<"hiof of Police Wlttman and the two
new members of the board to succeed
Baum and Buckley. In that event the
first thing Sehmitz would probably do
would be to depose Casey as president of
the Board of Health and also a small
army of subordinates, including Health
Officer O'Brien, Superintendent Kelly of
the Alrnsbouse, City Chemist Green "and
Resident Physician McElroy of the City
and County Hospital, would follow suit

"I vat 8 1 ways a delicat**. Fpoiled child

school my nervousness increased and my
parents thought it was due to my going
to school, so they took mo out again.- But
I did not ppt any better and my head-
aches got worse and weakened me m>
that I was unfit for any duty. Sometimes
I would gi a whole day without any other
nourishment than a cud of coffee.
"Kan spring I had a bad attack of the
Gripp* and wh<n I recovered I found that
coffee nauseated me so I could not drink
'.l and even a few swallows would cause
a terrible burning In my stomach. It was
nt ihls time that a friend who had been
much benpflud by the use of Po*tum eug-
B*-Med that I try this food drink. I found
it dimply delicious" and have used It ever

my life, for I know coffee would have

â¢ People who have suffered from piles for
years are often astonished at the instant
relief experienced from the first applica-
tion. Another important . advantage is
the fact that any one can use the remedy
without detention from business or Inter-
ference with daily occupation.
"I feel It my duty to recommend the
Pyramid Pile Cure, for after suffering ten
years with a most distressing form of
Piles, I am entirely cured, thanks to this
remedy. Any one doubting this can write
to Margaret Brady, 156 Whitman street,
Cleveland, Ohio." ;
Before you reach this stage use a rem-
edy which removes. -the cause, thereby
eradicating the disease, and that is the
Pyramid Pile Cure, which Is sold by all
druggists at 50 cents a package: It Is in the
form of a suppository, is applied direct-
ly to the parts affected and brings about
a complete cure, quickly and painlessly.
A valuable little book on the cause and
cure of piles is published by the Pyramid
Drug Co., Marshall, Mich., and we ad-
vise every sufferer to send for a copy of
it. Â¦ ..
Is Crushed by Chronic Troubles.
One of the most weakening, undermin-
ing troubles which mankind Is heir to Is
hemorrhoids or piles. The victim Is care-
less and neglectful of, the disease at first
because the pain Is slight and the bleed-
Ing may only occur occasionally, or he
may be reassured by the occasional disap-
pearance of the symptoms. And yet-if at
the very start he had found a j rational
remedy to soothe the inflammation he
would probably never have had a return
of this irritating malady.
Piles may develop at any season of the
year, and at almost any age of the vic-
tim: the abuse of cathartics often causes
this trouble and a period arrives when
the dread of pain at stool becomes so
great that the sufferer begins to neglect
the calls of nature and the bowels are
either forced to retain the ,feces or are
only partially cleared, on account of the
suffering -attendant upon v a thorough
movement. .

MARKED SKILL
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20. âThe -special
purse of $500 hung up for Kenllwprth and
Blissful as a result of the disputed de
cision on last Saturday, when the Judges
placed Kenilworth first and it looked as
if Blissful clearly won by nearly, a length,
jras the feature at the track this after
noon.
As E. B. Smith, owner of Blissful, ob
jected to the regular officials. Joseph
Chanslor. Lee Blasingame and R. ." D.
Havey, acted as judges on this occasion
at the' association's request: The books
laid 1 to 3 on Kenilworth, which horse
carried 120. and 2 to 1 on Blissful with 104
in the sa,ddle.
Time has worked changes since last the
pair met. Saturday the hottest sort of a
tip existed in Innermost horse circles on
Blissful, but to-day the educated ones all
strung their coin on the chances of
Stover's bird. Then again Willie See,
who rode Kenilworth, had eviden/ly been
handed a new set of Instructions. In the
Pasadena stake, he' began taking his
mount back almost from the start, let
ting Blifsful breeze away in front. .This
afternoon a blind man could have sep
arated them at the wire over a phone.
Kenilworth stood the filly on her head
the first quarter, run in 23%, and then
skimmed by. the Judges in 1:13%.
The race excited little interest, and If
It was placed on the card to vindicate
the Judges for Saturday's . blunder the
public did not show approval by any
ostentatious display over the winner.
Four out of five took purses, but the
odds laid are so clnchy It matters â¢ little
to the books. The attendance was only
fair. Considerable interest was mani
fested In the Los Angeles stakes for 2:15
class pacers. The Washington horse.
Tidal Wave, owned by S. S. Bailey of
Seattle, ruled a pronounced choice in the
auction pooling, but had to be content
with second money. High Ball, a son of
the old Orange County favorite, Silkwood.
driven by Vance, won the first heat in
2:li l z without lashing up. The next two
were a repetition of the first, the black
fellow being almost pulled to a walk to
keep from distancing the field.
Leonado, a youngster by Vlnctor,
showed a high turn of speed in the two
year-old sprint, but he died away In the
stretch. Metlakatla was installed a 9
to 10 favorite, but as first choices have
fared badly of late her rather easy vic
tory over Red Cross Nurse and Joe
Smith evoked little enthusiasm-' Lester
Reiff's colt, Turtle, did not get away
from the barrier.
There was no favorite for the first run
ning affair, a five and a half furlong
scramble, with a trashy bunch of cheap
ones going to the barrier, 2 and 3 to 1
being offered about anything that had a
chance. The winner turned up in Urbano,
a 3 to 1 shot, trained by Charley Tupper
and ridden by a lad named Pussey. Bi
cycle took the place from Annie F, the
pacemaker. Martin Brady lacked the
speed of his namesake.
Ira Powell finished first on Step Around,
a Hal chance for the fourth running
affair. Jimmy Boland had Adnor in front
to the stretch turn, where the gelding
began bleeding and fell out of it. Step
Around then assumed the front position,
leading out the 3 to 2 favorite. Chileno.
with something to spare. Roltaire was
third.
Jockey Waterbury met with more suc
cess on the next favorite. He had the
leg up on El Oriente, the 6 to 5 choice
for the mile and fifty yard selling num
ber, and reached the wire an easy first
over George Dewey and Dr. Shorb. The
latter gelding will win some day with a
capable rider in the saddle. Tizona made
the running for half a mile and then re
tired.
The ring did get quite a shaking up
when Escalante won the concluding
sprint. The ex-Baldwin horse ran in the
name of C. H. Patten and. heavily sup
ported at 4 to 5, rattled off six furlongs
in 1:13. Americano, never very bother
some, disposed of Laureatea for place
honors. Father Wentker was knocked
out of It in the start.

1? ejected there' will be n^ opposition

of the fact that his injured foot will be
a matter of concern to him.

plicated yesterday by the arrival of Mar
tin Canole, the rising young Boston light

The^Senatorg did not land till the third,
when Casey, Hildebrand and McLaughlln
each singled, filling the bags. Townsend
hit to Deveraux. who touched second and
lined It to third, completing a double.
Hildebrand scored on the play. Just then
Truck Egan tore off a triple to left,
scoring Hildebrand.
Then there was a lull till the fifth.
when, the Senators squeezed two more
over. McLaughlin sparred for time and
was given a pass. Townsend swung at a
wild one and away It scooted over sec

was good enough to bring Mac in. Hogan
accidentally forced one In the same place
and Townsend made the trip to the plate.
No more runs showed till the cripples
created a deadlock in the seventh. Mes
serly walked and Devereaux sacrificed.
Gorton was there with the big drive

In with dame fortune. Score 4 to 4.
Fitzgerald pitched remarkable ball. In
asmuch as the cripples only got to him
for as many hits as they made runs. Two
errors, however, made up for the defi
ciency In base hits. Cooper was wild
and was hit safely nine times, 'but the
Senators did not move with any more
speed than the proverbial ice wagon
when they landed on the bases.
Peter's followers did most of their ag
gressive work in the first round. O'Hara
opened up the Jack pot with a drive to
right field,, and Mosklman fanned.
Schwartz binged It out to the fence and
O'Hara tore over the sacks till he reached
the rubber. Murdock forced Schwartz at
third and went to second while the latter
was being run down.
Martinke hit a hot one to Sheehan.
He winged it to first In a hurry, but
Townsend dropped the ball and let it go

has commuted, to expire immediately, the
sentences of Marshall,- Raines and Har
per, coal miners, who were convicted in
West Virginia on the. charge of resisting
a United States Marshal. They were sen
tenced on June 11, 1903, Marshall and Har
per to Imprisonment for eight months and
Raines to imprisonment for five mlnths in
the Raleigh Jail.
.The commutations, were granted on the
recommendations of the District Attorney
and Judge and Deputy Marshal who was
resisted, â¢ in which recommendations ;the
Attorney General concurred, for the main
reason that five others of the defendants
who. were Jointly indicted and pleaded
guilty received sentences of only three
months and have been discharged. , i
.A further 'reason for commutation Is on
account of the ill-health of the prisoners
and the unsanitary condition of the Jail

ADVERTISEMENTS.Firstâ The Portland Canal. There are two
channels parallel with each other Â¦ with four
islands between them. The Canadian conten
tion was that the northern channel should be
adopted. The United States contended for the
southern channel. On tho result of the de
cision depended thÂ© possession of the four Isl
ands â Kannaghunut, Sltklan, Wales and
Pearse. When the tribunal considered this
question the view of the three British com
missioners was that the Canadian contention
waa absolutely unanswerable. A memoran
dum was prepared and read to the commis
sioners, embodying our views and showing
It to be beyond dispute that the Canadian con
tention in this branch of the case should pre
vail and. that the boundary should run to tho
northward of the four Islands, thus giving
them to Canada. Notwithstanding these facts,
the members of the tribunal, other than our
selves have now signed an award giving two
of the ' islands, Kannaghunut and Sltklan, to
the United States. These two Islands are tha
outermost of tho four. They command the
entrance of Portland Canal and the ocean
passage to Port 8lmpson. Their loss wholly
destroys the strategic value to Canada of
Wales and Pearse Islands. There Is. in our
opinion no process of reasoning whereby the
line thus decided upon by the tribunal can be
Justified It was never suggested by the coun.
Â¦el in the course of argument that such a line
was possible. Either the four Islands belong
to Canada or they belong to the United States.
In the award Lord Alverstone agrees with the
United States commissioners that the islands
shall be divided, giving the two which possess
strategic value to the United States.
Second â The line northward from Portland
Channel." Substantially the Canadian conten
tion regarding this line was that there are
mountains parallel with the coast, within tlw
meaning of the treaty of 1825, and that the
tops of such mountains should be declared the
boundary, the mountains nearest the sea being
taken. The United States' contention waa
that there are no mountains parallel with the
coast within the meaning of the treaty, and
that the boundary must, therefore, be fixed un
der the provisions of the original treaty to ten
leagues and to be run a distance of thirty-five
miles from the chore. Including In the term
"shore" the heads of all inlets, bays, etc. The
tribunal finds that the Canadian contention is
correct as "to, the existence of the mountains
within the terms of .the treaty, but the fruits
of victory have . been taken from Canada by
fixing as a mountain line a row of mountains
so far from the ccast as to give the United
States substantially nearly all the territory la
dispute. . â
-Around the head of the Lynn Canal the line
follows the watershed, somewhat in accordance
with the present provisional boundary.
We are of the opinion that the mountain line
traced by King, the x Dominion Â¦ astronomer,
along the coast should have been adopted, . at
least so far as the shores ' of the ' Lynn Canal.

TORONTO, Ont., Oct. 20.â Discussing
the Alaskan boundary decision, the Tele

The -Alaskan boundary controversy has ended

plomacy plays a part must end. In a victory for
a country that Is unscrupulous enough to
claim everything and cunning enough to trade
on the English good will that would sacrifice
anything rather than keep open a cause of dif

The "Witness (Liberal) says editorially:
It was as certain as any human question
could be that no commissioner appointed fty
the United States would ro back to their
country having voted to sacrifice Skagway and

coast and therefrom not more than ten marine
leagues, was it the intention and meaning of
said convention of 1825 that there should re
main in the exclusive possession' of Russia a
continuous fringe or strip - of roast . on the
mainland not exceeding ten marine leagues In
width, separating the British poMes&lons from
the bays, ports, inlets, havens and waters
of the ocean and extending from the eald point
on the fifty-sixth degree of latltuie north to
a point where such line of demarcation should
Intersect the one hundred and forty-flrst de
gree of longitude west of the meridian of
Greenwich?
6. If the foregoing question should be an
swered in the negative and in the event of
the summit of such mountains proving to be
in places more than ten marine leagues from
the coast, should the width of the lisiere
which was to belong to Russia be measured
(1) from the mainland coast to the ocean
strictly so-called, along a line perpendicular
thereto, or (2) was it the Intention and mean
ing of the raid con\-entlon that where the

the heads of the aforesaid inlets?
7. What, if any exist, are the mountains
referred to as situated parallel to the coast,
which mountains, when within ten marine
leagues of the coast, are declared to form the
eastern boundary?
The answers to those seven questions
are as follows:
1. The line commences at Cape Muzon.
2. The Portland Channel passes north of
Pearse and Wales Islands and enters the ocean
through TonRas Passage, between Wales and
Sltklan Islands.
8. A straight line to the middle of the en

destroying the strategic value of Wales
and Pearse islands, which are given to
Canada.
The mountain line adopted as the boun
dary' lies fo far from the coast as to give
the United States substantially all the
territory in dispute. The line completely
clears all the bays and inlets and means
of access to the sea, giving the United
States a complete land barrier., between
Canada and the sea, from the Portland
Canal to Mount St. Eiias. Around the
head of the Lynn Canal the line follows
the watershed, somewhat in accordance
with the present provisional boundary.
In consequence of the attitude main
tained by the Canadian commissioners.
Lord Chief Justice Alverstone decided this
morning to hold no proposed public meet-
Ing of the Alaskan Boundary Commis
sion, but to hand Its decision to Foster
and Slfton, respectively agents of the
American and Canadian Governments.
The Canadian Commissioners not only
declined to sign the award, but said they
would -publicly withdraw from .the com
mission. They, as well as 'the Canadians
connected with the case, are very bitter.
Telegrams from Premier Laurier and
other prominent persons in Canada show
that this sentiment Is shared generally
throughout the Dominion.
Jette and Ayltsworth, in a statement
of their reasons. for refusing to sign the
award, say that Â¦ they consider that the
finding of the tribunal regarding the
islands at the entrance of Portland Canal
and the mountain line is not a judicial
one. They add:
We urred our views aa strongly as we were
able, but we havo been compelled to witness
the sacrifice of the interests of Canada. WÂ«
were powerless to prevent it. though satisfied
that the course which the majority was de
termined to pursue In respect to the matters
above cpecially referred to Ignored the just
rights of Canada,
The Canadians almost openly accuse
Lord Alvertsone of partisanship. "When
tho latter presented them to King Ed
ward at Buckingham Palace yesterday the
King endeavored vainly to induce Jette
and Aylesworth to say they were satisfied
or that they accepted the situation, but
the two Canadians declined to in any way
express acquiescence with this view.
They simply shook hands formally and
bowed.
One of . the Canadian Commissioners
afterward said:
This award affects more the relations be
tween the Dominion and the. mother country
than people here B'-Â«n to realize and almost
marks the parting of the ways â at least to far
as leaving any euch question for England to
decide for us.
A Canadian who has been most inti
mately and prominently associated with
the Alaskan case Bald:
It is the hardest blew the Imperial tls has
ever received. The- place Lori Alverstono filled
was clearly that of agent for the British Go?

people to know '.hat, notwithstanding all pro
fessions of friendship and sympathy, the' sol

have been used simply for the purpose of band
ing over Canadian territory to the United
States. Canada nas not only been spontan
eous, but zealous In defense of British ter
ritory, and has not hesitated to sacrifice blood
and treasure in defeiise of the motherland.
Ehe mutt now face the fact that, when im

DIGEST OF THE DECISION.
Tribunal's Answer to the Seven Ques
tions in Contention.
LONDON, Oct. 20.â The following is an
official digest of the Alaskan decision.
The seven questions submitted to the arbi
trators were:
1. What iÂ« intended aa the point of coia
mencement of the llnef
3. What channel Is the Portland Channel ?
i What courte should the line take from
the point of commencement to the entrance to
Portland Channel?
Â«. What point on the flf tyÂ»Â»lxth parallel
The tribunal stated that there was not
sufficient evidence, owing to the absence
of a complete survey, to identify . the
mountains which corresponded to those
intended by the treaty. This contemplates
a further survey of that portion by the
two governments.
From the vicinity. of Devils Thumb the
line runs to the continental watershed,
thence through White and Talya or Chil
koot passes westerly to a mountain in
dicated on the map attached to the treaty
as 6508 feet, thence to another mountain
5800 feet and from that point in a some
what curved line across the head of the
glaciers to Mount Fairweather. This
places the Canadian outpost on the upper
waters of Chllkat River in British ter
ritory and the mining camps of Porcu
pine and Glacier Creek in American ter
ritory. From Mount Fairweather the line
passes', north on high peaks along the
mountains indicated on the map by
Mounts Â¦â¢ Pljita, Ruhama and Vancouver
to Mount St. Ellas.
7. The majority of the tribunal have selected
the line of peaks starting at the head of Port
land canal and running along:. the hitch moun
tains, on the .outer edce of the mountains,
shown on the maps of survey made in -1S93,
extending to Mount Whipple and thence along
what Is known as the Hunter line . of 1878,
crossing the Sltklne River about twenty-four
miles north, thence northerly along the north
ern peaks to Kates Needle, from Kates Needle
to tho Devils Thumb.
5. Answered in the affirmative.
6. Required no answer after the fifth ques
tion had been answered In the affirmative.

At Newcastle to-night Joseph Chamber

when he addressed an enthusiastic meet
ing 3 of 4000 people, and held hl3 audience
for an hour and a half. A novel feature
of the meeting was a battery of telephone
receivers placed in front of the speaker's
platform, by means of which the speech
was conveyed directly to the offices of
local newspapers. Interest in the tariff
controversy has apparently not abated,
reports on the speech and comments on
it taking precedence In the press of even
the decision of the Alaskan boundary
tribunal. The speech was principally a
reply to criticisms of Chamberlain's pre
vious utterances.
"The private Secretary is commanded to
say that the Kins never expresses any
opinion on. political matters except on
the advice of his responsible Ministers,

PARIS, Oct. 20.â A Rome correspondent
learns from a trustworthy source that the
Pope has expressed his Intention to open
negotiations, of course unofficially, with
the Italian Government relative to the
basis of a possible modus Vivendi between
church and State, with a view of putting
an end to the fruitless conflict which has
existed between them for many years.
"His Holiness," the correspondent says,
"has been Induced to take this course
partly by his personal convictions, but, to
some extent, also by reasons connected
with his health. He is anxious to be in
a position enabling him to leave the Vati
can, as he has always been accustomed
to an open-air life.
"Before taking this step, which would
appear to all the Catholic world as a con
cession to the kingdom of Italy, the Pope
desires to ascertain the possibility of ob
taining some concession of benefit to the
papacy which would render his action jus
tifiable."

Roosevelt has to-day received many con

Alaskan boundary dispute. Notwithstand

missioners to sign the report, no ques

or continue the controversy. The Cana

Attitude of Canadians Cannot Affect
the Result.
We have not been aWe to derive any under
standing from our colleagues on the commis
sion as to the principle upon which they have
selected the line of mountains and our ob
servations of the discussions which resulted in
the settlement of this line have led us to the
conclusion that. Instead of resting- on any in
telligible prinrlple, the choice of this line has
been a compromise between opposing and en
tirely Irreconcilable views as to the true
meaning of the original treaty. The result of
this compromise haw. we think, been a dlntlnct
sacrifice of the interests of the Canadians.
"When it was shown that there were mountains
parallel with the coast within the meaning of
the treaty the only logical course, in our Judg
ment was to adopt as a boundary the moun
tains' in the Immediate vicinity of the coast.
Regarding the general question of inlets, the
tribunal finds against the contention of Canada.

ing herself of her right to claim the head of
the Lynn Canal, we would have regarded such
conclusion as perhaps an open and reasonable
justification. Xo such position can. however,
be taken regarding the Inlets lower down the
coast. Kings line, running along the coast to
the Lynn Canal, following the watershed,
would have given Canada the heads of the
lower inlets, with at least one fine harbor,
from which easier access to the interior of the
Atlln and Yukon country could have been had.
It would not, so far as we have been made
aware, have taken any territory ever actually
occupied by United States citizens; it would
have given the United States the whole of the
Lynn Canal, including Skagway, Dyea and
Pyramid harbors, and It would have, we think,
been reasonably satisfactory to Canada.
Instead of taking the coast line of moun
tains a line of mountains has been chosen far
back from the coast, clearing completely all
the bays. Inlets, etc. The mountain line
adopted as the boundary line lies so far from

Another, who looked . the picture of
health, said he never ate a meal without
taking a Stuart Tablet afterward be-
causo he could eat what he pleased and
when he pleased without fear of a sleep-
less night or any other trouble. Â¦- â¢
Still another used them because he was
subject to gas on stomach, causing pres-
sure on heart and lungs, shortness of
breath and distress in chest, which he
no longer, experienced since using the
tablets regularly.
Another claimed that Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets was the only safe remedy he
had ever found for sour stomach and
acidity. He had formerly used' common
soda to relieve the trouble, but the tab-
lets were much better and safer to use.
After, smoking, drinking or other ex-
cesses ! which weaken the digestive or-
gans, nothing restores the stomach to a
healthy.wholesome condition so effectual-
ly as Stuart's Tablets.
Stuart's "Dyspepsia, Tablets contain the
natural digestives, pepsin, diastase, which
every weak stomach lacks, as well as
nux, hydrastin; and 'yellow parilla, and
can. be . Â¦Â¦ safely* relied . on -'as a radical
cure for every form of poor digestion.

An advertising agent, representing a
prominent New York magazine, while on
a' recent western trip, was dining one
evening in a Plttaburg restaurant
While waiting for his order he glanced
over* his newspaper and noticed the ad-
vertisement of a well known dyspepsia
preparation, Stuart's l>yspepsla Tab-
lets; as he himself was a regular user
of the tablets, he began speculating as
to how many of the other traveling men
in the dining room were also friends of
the popular remedy for indigestion.
He says: I counted twenty-three men
at the tables and in the hotel office I
took the trouble to Interview them and
was surprised to learn' that nine of the
twenty-three made a practice of taking
one or two. of Stuart'a Dyspepsia Tab-
lets after each meal.
One of them told me he had suffered so
much from stomach trouble that at one
time he had been obliged to quit the
road, but since using Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets had been entirely free from, in-
digestion, but he continued their use, eB-
peclally while traveling, on account of
irregularity in meals and because, like all
traveling men he was often obliged to eat
what he coud get and not always what
be wanted.

ATVEBTISEMENTS.
EVER GIVE
GRAPE-NUTS.
Your Thinker a Thought?
Funny things happen in this world
rnd now and then some of them make
rtr-e an interested observer, for instance:
Several years ago a man pursued a sys-
tematic course of investigation to dis-
cover wh2t kind of elements the body
would take up from the vegetable king-
dom out of which to make gray matter
in the brain and nerve centers through-
out the body; also how to prepare this
food so that it would be easily digested
and allow Nature to make use of these
elements. So far the proposition was
all right. Question â How to bring all
this about?
It took ever two years' work to solve
the problem successfully. After it was
solved the food was given to many
people and the result watched carefully.
When ai! results were proven beyond
doubt the food was put on the market
under the name of Grape- Xuts. Then
followed public announcement in the
newspapers and magazines that such a
food was in existence, and that it would
perform its intended work.
People all over the world realized the
need of such a food and began purchas-
ing it liberally. It attracted so much
attention that a long list of imitators
sprung up all over the country. They
boiled wheat, roasted it. stewed it,
chopped it. mixed it with rye. malt,
cats, and perhaps hay â we are not
sureâ gave it a fantastic name and told
the public it was a "Brain food."
Then, from these imitators, came the
offerings of spoons, knitting needles,
chisaware, pictures, doll babies and even
pianos tq induce people to gorge them-
selves with the various and sundry
things.
Fortunately the most of these imita-
tion foods are harmless and decently
clean so that no real harm is done except
that people who pay out money to se-
cure a food for special service have a
right to expect an equitable return for
that money.
Investigation proves that in practi-
cally all cases where imitations are put
upon the market the men who place
them are untrained and have, no knowl-
frige of the Teal scientific basis of food-
making. If they did have, they would
produce original articles. The very fact
that they make imitations is prima facie
evidence that they have no professional
ability to originate valuable articles
themselves, but must get under the
caves of some originator. .*â¢Â¦-:.
\Sp to the present time no prepared
food has appeared, to the knowledge of
the writer, that is made opon the solid,
fundamental, scientific basis of Grape-
Xuts.
In this celebrated food the ris:ht part3
of the wheat and barley are selected,
they pass through various and sundry
mechanical processes (absolutely no
chemical treatment.) In these processes
the starchy elements are slowly trans-
formed into a sugar now known as Post
Sugar. In this form it is ready for im-
â¢mediate assimilation and transmission
to the blood without taxing the diges-
tive organs. By the blood the elements
which Nature uses for rebuilding: the
soft gray matter in the brain and nerve
centres are carried to the respective
parts and there made use of. while other
elements known as carbohydrates are
carried to the muscles and tissues and
there deposited and held in readiness for
use when energy and warmth are de-
manded. Remember that simply raising
the aim requires the expenditure and
giving off of warmth and energy. Now
then we must have the elements that
supply warmth and energy deposited in
these tissues and muscles else we cannot
release them and make use of them.
These are the missions of Grape-Nuts,
and the person who desires to make use
of the proper rebuilder of brain and
r.trve centres, and keep them' in first-
class working order, and also make use
of a supply of warmth and energy, can
absolutely rely upon securing this serv-
ice if they feed regularly on Grape-Nuts.
The?e are incontrovertible facts dem-
onstrated by actual use by hundreds of
thousands of Anglo-Saxons to-day.
There's a reason and a profound one
for the use of Grape-Nuts. The food is
already cooked at the factory and can be
served instantly with rich cream. It is
delicious and can be made into a great
variety of toothsome dishes after the
recipes found in the recipe book en-
closed In each package.
Attention is also invited to another
very small but "meaty" little book in
each package under the title. "The Road
to WelJvlle."
Grape- Xuts food is made at the Pure
Food Factory of the Postum Cereal
Co., Ltd., and sold all over the world.

In the non-auction markets axe two classes
of dealers â the commission and the buyer. For
the former I have more than the ordinary re
spect. I am satisfied a reasonably honest
commission man can earn his commission and
am not so sure the commission trade has a
make-up that Is over 100 per cent worse than
the make-up In any other line of business. The
buyers have their "snap" In the so-called
"t. o. b." business without putting up a cent.
They buy f. o. b. California, and from nine to
twenty days later, on arrival of fruit, they
accept if there is a profit and reject If there
Is a low in eight on the fix of the market at
time of its arrival. If they reject, what's to
do about it? They buy subject to Inspection
on arrival, and if the market is off it is quite
Impossible for them to see any good fruit or
fruit in good condition in the car. If the mar
kets are up the sales go and the shipper. If re
sponsible, dare not divert and got the current
market price; he must keep hands off or be
liable for breach of contract. I have been told
repeatedly by the dealers. In effect, that no
matter what price they paid they would make
a loss almost every time because there Is
enough common to bad fruit In the cars on
which they make more looses than they can
offset by profit made on the good fruit.
In a sense the grower Is a manufacturer. No
other manufacturer Is ass enough to devote
all his time, money and attention to the making
of a product and doing absolutely nothing with
that product but to pack and deliver it. The
people who do the marketing have nothing to
do but to "do" the fruit-grower. The pro
ducer gets mighty poor net returns. Undoubt-
The avowed intent of the honest buyer is to
buy as cheaply as his competitors: else he can
not compete In selling. These people go to the
sales willing to pay full value. A snap is
worked, the price is thereby established and
they cannot afford to and will not pay a
higher price. I could tell much of the work
ins*, but the above will suffice. I guess.
The auction markets have been worked by
parties heavily In the fruit shipping here. They
gather in the fruit here, shipping It to them
selves at their auction, where their hired men
(the auctioneers) dispose of It. They send hired
men to buy at their auction of their hired man.
the auctioneer. Whole carloads, or as much
thereof as the buyer wants. Is the limit of a
purchase on one bid.
Prior to a sale the auctioneer could be told.
"We want a heavy line of fruit to-day; look
often at John." Well, John would get all he
wanted and at his price. I have seen it
swiped day after day. week after week.
Wishing to please a dealer from In or out of
town. It is only necessary to tell the auctioneer
to see him and his bids. If one auctioneer
rebels a little he would be in trouble. He in
working, has a good job. can see on the floor a
friend of his at times and make it pay.
Any Impression that market conditions gov
ern values Is "childlike and bland."

Bitter experience had taught me something.
Last year I sent fruit to the Eastern market
and got nothing In return for It. AH the re
ceipts were eaten up by those who had it in
chaige. The same is true of my experience
the preceding year. This season was excep
tionally good for prices, but I was determined
not to risk having to send money on to make
up a deficit after getting nothing in return for
my entire fruit crop. I made an agreement
with the commission men to cultivate the
ground, to pick the fruit, to pay the transpor
tation charges and refrigeration charges, to do
all the business, in fact. If there was a de
ficiency then, when they had all the details of
handling and all the fruit also in their own
fcauds. I was not to pay 4t. That was to be
the'.r lookout. The result is that in a great
vear for prices I get back the small percentage
thut $540 is of the $4000 that I know was re
ceived for the fruit.
Now I may add â and my helplessness in thid
regard is no greater than that of nearly every
d<-ciduous fruit grower who ships to the mar
kets â that I do not know what price was ac
tually paid for my fruit; that I do not know
what the transportation charges actually were.
All the knowledge I have is that contained in
the returns made to me. I could accept that
or nothing. I simply handed my fruit ranch
of fifty acres over to the middlemen. They
gave me Just what they had a mind to. But
what could I do? This may seem to be a
queer questionâ and indeed It seems such to
me, but the facts are as I state them and 6ueh
facts are known to all growers of deciduous
fruits.
The truth Is that we fruit growers In Cali
fornia cannot market fruit on our own account.
The larpe fruit companies have an understand
ing with the refrigeration lines. No one but
these companies can get the cars to move
fruits to market. Therefore we are, under the
present conditions, entirely at their mercy. If
the State Board of Trade can help us. it will
perform a service of Inestimable value to the
fruit growers of California. We all wish It
success.
W. R. Fountain of the Fountaln-Hol
brook Fruit Company of Newcastle, deal-
The Fresno raisin growers early saw the
signs and guarded themselves against
frauds. Their products do. not leave their
warehouses until the check In payment
for them Is produced and there Is no
question of the price to be paid. The
orange growers of Southern California
have also provided means to guard their
own interests. The shippers of deciduous
fruits are the principal sufferers from the
marketing scheme in vogue.
A fruit shipper of large experience yes
terday made a statement of the condi
tions attending his business. During the
season just closed he sent out through
the commission men from Yolo County
fruit that brought $4000, according to the
signed returns that came back to him
from the people in the East who handled
it. From this it must not be supposed
that the grower has received $4000. On
the contrary he got back only. J540. The
remainder was eaten up in transporta
tion, refrigeration, commissions, sacrifice
sales at auction, etc. His crop represent
ed the output of fifty acres. On that ba
sis he received for all his risk, labor and
investment just $10 per acre. This pro
ducer said:

It is a matter of common knowledge
that California, if It received Its dues
from its fruit shipments, would Increase
enormously In wealth. Its very richness

sorts of schemers.
by which the California farmers
are deprived of the returns due to them
when their fruit Is marketed.
Soon after the State Board of Trade In
structed Its manager, Arthur R, Briggs,
to report at the next meeting of the board
concerning the cost and feasibility of
sending a representative East to make
the necessary Inquiries, a circular letter
was pent out by The Call, addressed to
leading men in various localities. Of
ficers of boards of trade and other organ
izations, including associations exclusive
ly of fruit growers, were asked to assist
in throwing light on this question of great
public interest. Some responses have been
received.

No fruit grower here will deliver his fruit to

pent fruit East on consignment has compelled

When the Eastern demand is good then there

Our fruit men have had troubles such as you
suggest, but they believe they art at an end.
through the recently organized Fruit Agency,
which will handle 95 per cent of our crop of
fruit and which Is almost exclusively oranges.
Under the new arrangement nothing will be
consigned. Those best Informed believe that
the check placed about the agency's agents will
entirely prevent any loss from that source.
The agency will have an agent at large, with
headquarters at Chicago, who, it Is believed.
In as competent and reliable a man as can be
selected. However, the advisability and value
of sending an agent to learn the facts, as is
proposed. Is conceded.
E. T. Reynolds writes from the Chlco
Chamber of Commerce, of which he is the
president:
1 will suggest one matter: In my opinion wn
are not doing what we ought to do, which iÂ» to
advertise California citrus fruits, both in the
East and in foreign countries, and I hope that
if an agent is sent out he will consider this
point in connection with other points of mar
keting that he may investigate.
Secretary Thaxter in a communication
writes from Redlands:
The organization that I represent, being af-i
flliated with the Southern California Fruit Ex
change branch of the California Fruit Agency,
our growers have at all times full Informa
tion as to the marketing of their products, all
fruits being handled by our own salaried
agents. Before the days of co-operation, the
experiences of orange growers were practically
the same, to wit: They gave their fruit to a
commission house and got any money that the
commission men chose to give them, knowing
nothing as to the price that their fruit really
sold for. I hope most sincerely that the In
vestigation will be undertaken, as facts, from
the other end are always valuable, and will, I
feel sure, help the cause of co-operative mar
keting. It may also be of great value to us
by suggesting Improvements to our present sys
tem.
The fruit growers of Placer and many others
from all parts of California with whom Ihavo
conversed since green fruit has been shipped
to the East would feel grateful to any insti
tution that would perform the meritorious work
to show what becomes of the difference of the
money paid by the consumer and that which
the California growers receive. It is only by
thorough Investigation that this problem can
be solved. The grower, as a rule, has not the
ability nor the time to do this, and I can speak
for him that he will be only too grateful to
whoever does this great work. I shall ask
leading fruit growers to give you their expe
rience.
How the fruits of Southern California
are marketed is told in letters that have
been received by The Call from W. E.
Sprott, secretary and manager of the Tu
lare County Citrus Fruit Exchange, and
G. C. Thaxter, secretary of the Redlands
Board of Trade. ' Mr. Sprott hopes that
the proposed investigation will be under
taken, as it will help the cause of co
operative marketing. His communication
is as follows:

edly a remedy may bÂ« found. Undoubtedly the
owner of a property must take an interest In
It and do something to take care of it. CÂ° U Â»J
the orchard properties in each county be merged
or bunched up into a company to market the
fruit, be incorporated probably and stock and
some cash paid to each owner. of an orchard
on the basis of a fixed amount per hundred
trees in full bearing? It's quite too biff a nut
for me to crack. We have the soil, cmnfUe
orchards and good, biff crops regularly. Plant
ing; more trees will increase the output, but do
we want the output increased? In my opinion
we do not, and to promote such planting is
near enough to the criminal. When we have
learned to market our property: when we have
taught the Southern Pacific Company to not
sell the exclusive privilege of. refrigerator serv
ice and support it by an all-summer go aÂ« you
please service; when we have taught them to
furnish suitable care for fruit as they do for
livestock or any product and to give a quicK
service for the fruit or pay the losses of every
delay; when we have taught ourselves to be a
factor In the marketing, then we can get the
proceeds and know whether or no it Is good
business to produce more fruit.

LIBELS ARIZONAN
FOR LARGE SUM
A. P. Eide Asks Dam
ages of $20,000 for
Loss of an Eye.
Says Injury Prevents His
Promotion to Position
of Engineer.
A. F. Elde, water tender, filed a libel
yesterday in the United States District
Court against the steamship Arizonan to
recover $135 wages alleged to be due and
$20,000 damages for the loss of sight of
the left eye. The complaint recites that
while acting as a L water tender on board
the Arizonan on the voyage from San
Francisco to New York last spring a
water gauge exploded and destroyed the
sight of his left eye. The complaint then
goes on to recite:
Llbelant as water tender was In the line for
promotion In his . profession to the position of
marine steam engineer and had the mental
and Dhyslcial qualifications to enable htm to
secure such promotion, of the greater part of
all of which he has by said Injury been de
prived. That at all times prior to said injury
and at the time thereof llbelant was possessed
of a cheerful, hopeful and courageous dispo
sition or temperament, which enabled him to
take, and he did take, a cheerful and hopeful
view of the future. That the direct result of
his said injury has been and is and will con
tinue to be that his disposition, temperament
and courage have been ao impaired that llbel
ant Is not now and will not in future be able
to take a cheerful or hopeful view of his fu
ture, and now has and will continue to -have
but a small degree of his former courage
wherewith to meet the same.
It is further alleged in the complaint
that the respondent failed to provide him
with proper medical attention and care
and that there was no surgeon or physi
cian on board me vessel.
CAPTAIN AND WATCHMAN
QUARREL ON A STEAMER
Chinese Bureau to Investigate the
Charges Against Anderson and
M. S. Blackburn.
Passengers on board the steamship Si
beria were entertained last Saturday by
an interchange of oral discourtesies be
tween Captain Anderson, Â¦ superintendent
of the Mail dock, and M. S. Blackburn,
in charge of the force of Government
watchmen at the Chinese detention shed.
Stories are conflicting as to the termin
ation of the verbal duel', one being to the
effect that after the duelists had exhaust
ed their vocabulary of disparaging epi
thets they separated fujning and smoking
and sputtering like intermittent volca
noes. The other story is that the bellig
erent dialogue terminated with blows,
which had a- damaging effect upon the
countenance of Captain Blackburn, who
Is an ancient In years.
Charges have been filed with the Chi
nese bureau against Captain Anderson of
interfering with a Government employe
in the discharge of his duty. United
States Immigration Commissioner Hart
H. North professes to be ignorant of the
affair beyond the fact that there was a
quarrel between the men and that he was
awaiting a report from Charles Mehan,
chief deputy in charge of the Chinese bu
reau, who was about to begin an investi
gation.

Assault to Murder.
James Roche . Swears Out Warrant

in Chinatown, swore to a complaint be
fore Police Judge Fritz yesterday charg
ing .James Gllson, a furniture polisher,
with assault to murder. Roche was on

time, but as no complaint was sworn
to and no one appeared to prosecute the
case it was dismissed by Police Judge
Fritz.
Roche and Gllson lived at the Elite
lodging-house, 207 Kearny street, and on
the night of July 1 Gilson, who was un
der the influence of liquor, quarreled with
Mrs. M. A. Boyce, the landlady. Roche
happened to enter the room where they
were Quarreling and acted the part of
peacemaker. Gilson would not be paci
fied and. pulling a revolver out of his
pocket, fired a shot at the landlady. The
bullet struck her on the knuckles of her
right hand and, glancing, off, lodged in
Roche's leg. Roche has been confined in
a hospital since the shooting.

LOCAL MARKETS.
There was a good local Inquiry for fresh
fruits and as receipts were light prices were
steady. Table Grapes in small packages . were
steady, there being a fair Inquiry for ship
ment on the Portland steamer. Offerings in
large boxes ruled flrm. Tokay, which were
the most plentiful, moved freely at 83c@U
per box, while Muscat and Cornlchon were
flrm at $1 25@1 50, with occasional sales of
the former reuorted at $1 75. Wine Grapes
were very weak, the demand being slack, re
ceipts heavy and the carryover from the pre
ceding day large. The market Is littered with
soft and leaking stock, which came to hand
during the recent hot spell, and such stock Is
hard to sell. Aside from Grapes, Apples were
the most active descriptions and sales of
strictly fancy Spitzenbenrs were still reported
in a small way at $1 25 pÂ«r box. Supplies of
all other descriptions, were plentiful and
prices were without quotable change. Winter
Nellls Pears were offering freely and sold at
a wider range, a large portion of the offer
ings being . very small. Fine large \ stock
cleaned up readily at the top quotation under
a good demand for storage purposes. Figs
continued scarce, with prices largely nominal.
The other tree fruits were plentiful and rather
dull. Cantalouoes and Watermelon* were
plentiful and easy, while Nutmeg Melons were
in good request at ; firmer . prices. Citrus and
tropical Â¦' fruits were quiet and featureless.'

XEW YORK, Oct. 20â Wall streets highly

varlablv, took an extreme view of the harm
ful possibilities of Monday's event in Balti
more. Finding this to be the case to-day, the
I operators who sold stocks with undue freedom
j on Monday bought them back to-day. The de
crease in the volume of dealings indicates that
I not all of the stocks sold on Monday were re
bcught to-day. Prices moved easily upward.
1 however, and retrieved the greater part of yes
| terday's losses. Whether there was more
1 causes for yesterday's perturbation"" than was
I ii-dlcated by the sequel to-day may never be
I known, but the acuteness of the fears felt yes
terday was greatly dissipated from the outset
cf the market and confidence grew steadily
throughout the day. There was a small set
back during the final hour, but this was ap
parently due to nothing more than the normal
profit taking by room traders Invited by so
considerable an advance. â¢ The market rallied
again and closed very firm and but little be
low the best. It was generally understood be
j fore the opening of the market that concerted
1 measures had been taken at Plttsburg to pro
tect any weakness In the situation there. It
was aleo knotrn that heavy transfers of cur
rency wÂ»re being made to Baltimore to insure
protection against sudden demands upon de
posits there. It became known immediately
In Wall street also that all of the Baltimore
institutions had opened their doors this morn
ing and only slight evidences of fear were
being shown by depositors. Such as was shown
was reported later as being dissipated, and
opinions were quoted even that the receiver
ship in at least one of yesterday's Instances
had beÂ»n unduly precipitated. It cannot be
said that the character of to-day's buying car
ried very great conviction as to its substantial
quality, as mest of it was attributed to pro
fessional operators either for purposes of.cov-.
erlng short accounts or for manipulating prices
against the- short interests. Nevertheless the
considerable advance in prices failed to de
velop any new pressure to sell stocks, and was
effective also in impressing the shorts with
the desirability of covering the short con
tracts. In contrast with the recent air of con
fidence of the bear party in selling the market
on an occasional rally. The feeling among the
â¢ bears was that the failures at Baltimore had
uncovered the weak spots In the situation and
the fact that to-day brought no extension of ;
the trouble gave the impression that the worst 1
or the strain was over, which would demon- '
ttrato sufficient strength in the situation to '
withstand any longer demands that might fol

_*# n* f7ri!7riny7nr\nrri]Miles T. BainJ, a wealthy young man
about town, who pleaded guilty before
Police Judge Fritz on Monday to charges
of discharging firearms within the city
limits, carrying a concealed weapon and
malicious mischief, appeared for sentence
yesterday. He was fined JoO on each of
the first two charges, and, after a few
minutes' delay, Attorney Partridge, who
represented the defendant, asked that
sentence be postponed till Saturday on
the malicious mischief charge.
Baird, on the night of October . 8, fired
a shot through the swinging door of the
Russ House barroom, and the complain
ant in the malicious mischief case/ is
Charles Newman, the proprietor. During
the . interval between the calling of that
case and the request for a postponement,
Robert C: Mitchell, manager of the New
York Life Insurance Company, who had
a complaint drawn , up some days ago
charging Baird with exhibiting a deadly
weapon in a rude and threatening man
ner, was asked by the Judge to swear to
the complaint.
â¢ "I don't want to do so," replied Mit
chell, vtill Baird-has settled with New
man." ;VJ-^-" : :Vf"L -
j "What have you got to do with New
man?" asked the Judge. "If you don't
swear to the complaint to-day you will
not have the opportunity of doing so
again."
. Mitchell swore to the complaint and
Baird was taken to the City Prison and
booked on the charge. He was at onc<i
released on bail. Mitchell accuses him of
entering the saloon on Montgomery street
on, the night of October 8, while he was
chatting with some friends, and, by
placing a revolver against his abdomen,
compelling him to drink with him, al
though they were total strangers.

Boman Belies Found at Paris.
Roman relics have recently been found
In Paris, writes a Paris correspondent.. The
distinguished French archaeologist,
Charles Magne. has made excavations in
the Rue Cassinl, where he had long sus
pected there lay remains of old Roman
glories. He discovered the cover of i a
tomb, on which is sculptured in bas-relief
a Roman blacksmith wearing his apron.
In his left hand he brandishes a long pair
of pincers and forceps. The- right arm la
broken off, but probably held a hammer.
M. Magne judges from the stylo of the
work and from a piece of money of the
time of Nero found near the tomb that
the work Is of the first century.â New
York Tribune.

THEY WANT JUSTICE,
; They want Justice. They don't want every
thing given to them and nothing to the other
people. .They want an administration that
will give them the best results. They are go
ing, therefore, to vote intelligently. They will
pledge their word to their employers and they
will pledge their friendship . to their fellow
craftsmen, but j there is one thing that the
workingman. never parts with and that is his
freedom .to vote and his freedom to act as he
pleases when it comes to his vote." 1
We are going to have a Republican victory;
that goes . without â¢ saying. â¢ (Applause.) We
are going to elect a good Republican ticket and
we are going to do , it; ladles, and gentlemen,
and mark you,. we will because the entire Re
publican party is going to vote for the Repub
lican . ticket this time. (Applause.) We are
going to be â¢assisted by people in -this city who
are . perhaps not of our party faith, v but who
know the kind of men the Republicans have
pUt.Up. =.Â¦ .;,-.,.,
â¢ If I oay a word for myself,*! want to say it
at this time. I want to say that the Repub
lican party is going to be voted for by a great
many Democrats and, workingmen. The Re
publican vote alone of this city will elect
Henry J. Crocker, but his friends are going to
assist In rolling up such a majority that there
will be no fear. of results, and I will feel my
self bound in every . way j to ; carry out ' ' the
wishes of every ; voting person of Â¦ San Fran
cisco and every resident of this city. (Ap
plause.) .,Â¦;â¢' .
Republican party has' selected as Its
candidates good, true, intelligent men. I have
never seen such a unanimity of sentiment as
has been expressed by the candidates, who
'pledgo themselves if .elected to be In one
accord In order that San Francisco shall have
a rood administration.
Â¦ The people of San Francisco are . going to
realize that there are really, two great parties
in Ban Francisco as ' elsewhere In the United
States. I allude to the Democratic and Repub
lican parties. I say that advisedly, because
my friends, the workingmen, ' have declared In
no uncertain terms, that they are out of poli
tics. A large majority of workingmen of San
Francisco are going to vote for one or the other
of the regular party tickets. I am sure of it. I
hope they, will see their way clear to vote for
the â¢ * Republican ticket. (Applause.) They
have told me that the Republican party of the
United ! States has been the best friend the
.workingmen ever had.
The people of this city have voted for a
charter, which has given them a better form
of government. The people have voted to
bond the city for many millions to beautify
the city and the people have decided to take
the matter in hand and elect a ticket at the
coming election . that . will do honor to the
metropolis. ...
BONDED â¢ THE CITY.
I 1 Ladies and gentlemen and ' fellow rooters
(laughter and applause): I don't think there
Is much . left for Henry J. Crocker to say.
Tou have listened with earnest attention to
the. speakers of. the evening and for the first
time ' in a political meeting' I have had an
opportunity of listening to some of the good
things said about the Republican party that
I -have not uttered.^ I am a little bit uncer
tain as to what I should say in consequence.
I- can say this, however, as I have my voice
with me: I have done my part In campaign
ing, as has been stated here. I have been
among the voters of San Francisco: I have
visited the foundries and workingmen through
out the city. I have visited the business men
and the Democrats. I have looked over the
field and as you have heard reported to-night,
we have won the victory. (Applause.)
. I propose to show the people of San Fran
cisco; what a candidate, with good Intentions,
with a desire to do right, with no affiliations
that will stop him in the performance of his
duties, without strings that could hold him
back or tie him down in his official capacity,
can do when he comes into the office of Mayor
of San Francisco. (Applause.)
One can hardly realize the great tribute
that San Francisco can offer to one of Its
citizens when it elects him to such a high
office. It is one oÂ£ the largest cities of this
Union; a city composed of intelligent citizens
that have come to her shores because they
are active and progressive and desire to get
what the world offers them.
TRIBUTE OFFERED.
When Chairman Greenebaum introduced
Mr. Crocker to the big gathering the
cheering was deafening. Men stood up in
every part of the hall and cheered for the
Republican nominee for Mayor. The out
burst lasted for many minutes and when
it had ceased Mr. Crocker spoke as fol
lows:
of the municipality. He told of his own
record in the Republican party and said
he was assurred of the support of the sol
diers, who, like himself, went to the front
to uphold Old Glory.
Maurice Asher, Theodore Lunstedt and
other candidates for Supervisor were In
troduced and cordially greeted. They ap
pealed to the voters to stand by the ticket
and they assured them if elected they
would give the people a clean administra
tion.

Chairman Grecnebaum introduced
George R. "Wells, candidate for Super
visor, and the last named was given a
generous reception. Mr. Wells spoke In
behalf of this city and painted Its future
In glowing colors. In part he said.
I am a candidate for the office of Super-

REPUBLICANS WINNERS.
It it very flattering: indeed to see euch art
outpouring of people at this time. I am satis
fled the same *pirlt will prevail fcr the next
two weeks and you will no doubt elect the
liepublican tlckft.
At a rr.eet.ing of the United 'Kepublieaa
l>ac.e held at headquarters before the con
vention met, I Faid a united Republican party
â¢res on* of the ihinps to b^ desired. I said
It would be the means of electing: the proper
Â«n*>n to eit In the convention and it would de
volve en thef-e men to select the proper and
xc*t available candidates for offic*.
My prediction. I am sure, ha* been fulfilled.
In all xr.y experience in politics, I have never
eeen a better body of men than the delegates
that eat in the late municipal convention; and
that body of men brought forth a set of can
<!.'dateÂ» for whom we can vote. It brought
forth that sreat and good citizen, Henry J.
Crocker, <ari'lause) who will be our next
Mayor. I have known Mr. Crocker since his
boyhood and I have always known him as a
man who can be fully relied upon and trusted
with everything that could be brought to his
e.tter.tloi. I havo known the father of this
candidate. The late Clarke Crocker was a
!Â¦â¢â¢-. eltszen and on* of the most useful men
Â¦ in California. We detire a better San Fran
cisco than we have had up to this time. I
c :.'t know cf any man in the city who can
carry out these projects better than our can
d'dcte, Henry J. Crocker. (Applause.)
I take pleasure In stating that our candidates
have not engaged In mud-slinging. A great
SARATOGA HALL was crowded last
night Trtth enthusiastic Republicans,
who cheered for Henry J. Crocker
and the other candidates on the
ticket. The meeting was held in the
Forty-Second District, which Is
strongly Republican. The outpouring last
right proved that the voters of the dis
trict are alive to the necessity of electing
a business man to the office of Mayor. In
the big hall last evening were work'.ng
m<?n and other representative citizens,
their wives and daughters, and it was
noted that they cheered loudly for the
standard bearer of the party which
etands for protection and prosperity.
William J. Horrin. an attorney, who Is
a rr-sidf-nt of the district, called the meet
ing to order. Jn his opening addrees he
stated that from reports he had received,
The people were behind the Republican
ticket and hi believed the people of this
city would show themselves to be un
grateful if they did r.ot vote the ticket at
the coming election. He also said that on
the evening the votes were counted, the
Republicans want to send a telegTam to
â¢President Roosevelt and to the adminis
tration at Washington that San Francisco
is not ungrateful and has gone Republican
by over 10,000. Mr. Herrin introduced A.
Grcencbaum, a well known merchant of
this city, who presided over the meeting.
Mr. Grecnebaum delivered an excellent
speech. He dwelt on the importance of
standing by the Republican party. He
eulogized the standard bearer and praised
the other men who are on the ticket. In
j?art he said:
Judson Brusie Refers
to National Is
sues.
George P. Wells Is
Indorsed by
Friends.

Sunday School Lecture.
The second of a series of lectures under
the auspices of the Sunday-school Com
mission, diocese of California, will be de
livered at St. Luke's Sunday School at 3
o'clock this evening by Rev. William
Guthrle. His subject will be "The Poetry
of the Bible."
HENRY J. CROCKER, Republican
nominee for Mayor, wins supporters
wherever he goes. He is acquainted
with leading men and many of the
boys in every district of the town.
He is cordially greeted in every sec
tion of the city. His purpose to do some
thing for thÂ« betterment of San Fran
cisco Is warmly seconded. It is remarked
to his credit that he does not descend to
mean personalities concerning rival'can
didates. The Republican campaign com
mittee Is especially well pleased with Mr.
Crocker's stylo of ' campaigning. He does
not profess to be a spellbinding profes
sional orator who can hold an audience
In rapt suspense. He goes before his fel
low citizens as a plain business man who
has achieved some success in the man
agement of laree enterprises, and prom
ises that he will give to the business
affairs of the great metropolis in which
he dwells the benefit of his Judgment.
Workingmen and business men of Dem
ocratic r.fflliatlon listen to Mr. Crocker,
and many of them sincerely entertain the
opinion that he is better fitted for the
position of Mayor of San Francisco than
any other candidate for that office now
before the people. The members of the
Republican campaign committee take into
account all the reports that pome to head
quarters from the various Assembly dis
tricts and are convinced that many Dem
ocrats will Join the Republicans in roll
ing up a big majority for Mr. Crocker.
GIVEN ROYAL WELCOME.
South of Market street gave Henry J.
Crocker a royal and reassuring welcome
yesterday afternoon when he spent sev
eral hours among the working thousands
of that section. The popular candidate
covered much ground, his trip extending
from the vicinity of Sixth and Brannan
streets to the offices of the Western Meat
Company in South San Francisco. The
reception on all sides was such as to
show that Mr. Crocker's quality of being
a "mixer" Is winning him much substan
tial aid and many votes in the race.
No one. high or low, missed his cordial
attention throughout all the many offices
of the railroad shops and workshops that
he visited. The clerks as well aa the
managers in each department of the rail
road shops and furniture factories re
ceived a cordial greeting and handshake.
With it was the personal, interested kind
of campaign talk that is making Mr.
Crocker more and more popular among
those who have to labor for their daily
bread each day.
The district south of Market street has
undergone a most radical cnange during
the past two weeks. The more laboring
men have talked with Crocker the more
they have realized that he is the man into
whose control it is safe and wise to put
the reins of city government.
It was a series of social knots of inter
ested men that gathered round the Re
publican candidate yesterday In each
place that he visited. By the buttons
these men wore as well as the words they
uttered it was plain to see that the vot
ers were giving him* support. The inci
dents of the afternoon were all such aa
to show the greatest and most Interested
good feeling for Crocker. He is a good
story teller,, aa well as. a good fact ex
pounder, and each man he meets leaves
him with a pleasant remembrance of his
personality and the helpful words that
he utters. It is safe to say that the dis
tricts south of Market street will poll a
good vote for Crocker on election day.
LAST NOTE -OF DESPAIB.
When the Democratic press shouts
"railroad" at the Republican nominee it
is a sure sign that the 1 Democratic cam
paign is not far from an Inglorious finish.
The cry is the last note of despair. It is
always heard on the eve of Democratic
disaster. Many years ago the pictures of
a locomotive frightened the taxpayers,
but the reign of railroad terror is over.
If another transcontinental railroad
should enter San Francisco during the
coming Republican administration of lo
cal affairs the people of the city would
not regard it as a calamity.
Last night Candidate Lane positively
threw up his hands. He announced that
he was â¢willing to refer the mayoralty con
test to President Roosevelt for. settle
ment by arbitration. Henry Crocker is
willing to refer the subject to the people
of San Francisco.
The star of Schmitz seems to be slight
ly on the wane. The Mayor travels rap
idly from one section of the city to an
other, but does not linger in one locality
much longer that he stays with one polit
ical party. Ruef is working hard to keep
up the supply of Incidental attractions.
Good singing enlivens the Ruef meetings.
It Is said that Schmitz contemplates a
fine exhibition in the Forty-fifth District
before the campaign closes. A combination
consisting of Mershon, Ruef, Parry and
the colt will be put on the stage. Lane
is lagging behind Schmltz. The Mayor
is speedier and shiftier than his Demo
cratic adversary. Schmltz has only been
In the political arena two years, yet with
in that, time he has belonged at onÂ© time
or another to every political party. Lane
has been in public life ten years and haa
belonged to only two partiesâ the Demo
cratic and Prohibition.

some have greatness thrust upon them." In
Ean Francisco we have all three conditions.
Ban Francisco was born great; in the second
place she has achieved greatness and finally
she has had destiny thrust greatness upon her.
Mr. Wells paused in his speech and the
leader of the band, believing he had
finished, started an Inspiring air and the
speaker's flow of eloquence received a
check. He gracefully retired and Judge
Brusie, a spellbinder of some fame, was
introduced and delivered a splendid
speech. He discussed the local campaign
from a national standpoint. The chair
man Introduced Brusie as a candidate
and the latter told his auditors that he
was one of the few exceptions to the
rule and was not a candidate.
IMPORTANT QUESTION.
I am going, to try and to suggest to every
man in this house to-night and to every woman
that either now, to-morrow or next 'week or
some time before this campaign is over, that
they ask thm selves a little question; one which
you will ask a. thousand times in your, lives.
It ' U simply this:' What 13 best â¢> for me?
Never mind the ether fellow. â¢-: What is best
for me? That's th* question ' that is being
asked by n. ereat many men in San Fran
cisco, and should bo put the last hour of the
day before election, before a decision lit
reached. Â¦ '
What will .the re-election of Eugene E.
Schmltz mean to me? i'oii all know what
It means to you. Not a nUht passes that he
does not tell the people of San Francisco what
it means to him. His friends are telling the
people what It means to them. Those who ex
pect to have office and these who have been
promised offices are talking:. â¢ His bonfires are
burning:; his sky-rockets are lighting the heav
ens; his banners hang on the outer walls;
spielers are spieling for him. and they will
continue to tell you what' it all- means until
the 3rd day of November; but when that time
comes, I could suggest that you do Bomethlng.
Go off to a quiet spot and think' it over.
Ask yourself, what doea it all mean to me?
What is best for me to do to-morrow: what
is best for my little home and its precious
contents, and when you ask that question.
recall other occasions in your life when you
were guided by the same judgment*, the eame
reasons that prevailed with you then.
REMEMBER HARD TIMES.
You remember the hard times in Ean Fran
cisco in 1891. You reruember the terrible con
dltlcns that pxistrd at that time. Did you
turn to Franklin K. Lane then?' - Did you go
to the Columbia theater and say to" Eugene
E. Schmltz, "Droo -your fiddle and your bow
and lead me out of the wilderness?" No! You
turned not to Franklin K. Lane; you turned
not to Eugene E. Schmltz; you. turned, the
leaves of your country'" history and what did
jou read? You read of other, dark days in
Ban Francisco, and you turned to the Repub
lican party, and that party, did not fail you.
You can subserve the interests of- your homed
and- the Interests of the United States and
the principles which have given 8an Fran
cisco what she has to-day, by voting the
straight Republican ticket . at the ' municipal
election on November 3rd. (Applause.) . _ . .Â».
Judge George ,H. - Bahrs - is still : Indis
posed and was unable to - speak. ' He, .
however, had an excellent representative
in his Bon, who not. only paid graceful
tributes to the head . of the â¢ ticket and
other candidates, but criticised Dr. Wash
ington I Dodge, the Democratic candidate
for 'Assessor. He said his father had re
ceived 19,000 votes as an independent can
didate, and he felt. certain. that: with. the
Republican party behind him he .would
defeat the incumbent of the office. He
also said Dodge had held the office two
terms and imagined that the office was
created for one man alone. ",' He
thought 'a man 1 less selfish * and less
grasping should conduct the affairs of
that- important office. â¢ .'..
Harry. Baehr, candidate for re-election
as. Auditor, was given a warm .welcome.
He pledged himself to carry out the duties
of his office In the same honorable way
he has during the last two years. Audi
tor Baehr also paid some high compli
ments to the head of the ticket
-Percy V. Long, candidate ' for City At
torney, was suffering ' from â¢ a bad cold
and was unable to speak at length.. He
expressed his pleasure : at' being able to
come before the voters of the Forty-sec
ond District and thank them for the sup
port accorded him in the past.
General E. 8. Salomon, nominee for Dis
trict Attorney, made quite an. impres
sion. General Salomon modestly referred
to the part he took In savins : this coun
try. He told of his record In the War of
the Rebellion and regretted he was not a
native son. He said that' Henry J.
Crocker was a man In whom the people
could entrust the duties of chief executive
visor from thU dletrlct. I have lived In Ban
Francisco nearly forty years, and the reason
that I have decided to run for this office at
this time la becausÂ« I love San Francisco. I
love the old traditions; I love the old Spanish
name; I love the people; I love their habits
and their customs; I hare become almost a
native Callfornlan myself. And when I have
cone Bast, I have noticed the difference In
people. I believe In the future of Ban Fran
cisco. I believe she Is destined to be thÂ« sec
ond city of the United States. She will be to
the Pacific Coast what ICew York on the At
lantic Is to that coast. We have only to look
around and sea what we must do to make this
a great city. Shakespeare says: "Some men
are born great; some achieve greatness and
