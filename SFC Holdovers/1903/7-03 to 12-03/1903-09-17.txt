FRUIT AND GRAIN AWARDS.
The, first ill feeling shown during the
sessions developed over an attempt to
change the constitution so*" as to allow
each accredited delegate on the floor to
vote on pending questions. Some of the
States are heavily overrepresented, and
as. the constitution of the congress pro
vides that no State shall have m6r e than
twenty votes this meant a great deal
to Montana, Idaho, â¢ Nevada. California,
Utah and other States with large delega
tions. The row was started by the South
western delegations, who are pulling al
most as a unit for El Paso as the place
of meeting in 1904, and after a rather
sharp debate a motion to 'table the pro
posed . amendment was carried almost
unanimously." _- This was considered a blow
to the chances of Boise, Idaho, for next
year. From expressions of delegates to
day there is a possibility that St. Louis
may be . selected, however, sentiment In
favor of that city apparently spreading
rapidly. *
All of the speakers urged more com
plete co-operation between States. land
owners and railroads in the general
scheme of colonization, without which,
they claimed, the scheme of irrigation
would be of no value.-

jg. yEW TORK. Sept 11â Presi-
J^kk I dent Roosevelt is resting
/ / quietly on bis train to-night
/ after a day of strenuous and
A Â» vatled experiences. While ea
route from Oyster Bay to
New Tork on the naval yacht Sylph hÂ«
passed through a terrific wind and rala
storm, during which the vessel was ia
imminent danger. Subsequently he vis
ited the immigration station on Ellis Isl
and. New Tork Bay, and made a thor
ough Inspection of the Institution.
After dining oa the Sylph to-night he
went on the revenue tug Chamberlain tÂ»
Jersey City, where he boarded a special
on the Pennsylvania Railroad, which U
to convey him. Governor Murphy of New
Jersey and their "invited guests to the
battlefield of Antietam. There to-mor
row will occur the ceremonies Incident to
the dedication of the monument erected
to the memory of New Jersey soldiets
who fell In the Civil War.
Shortly after 10 o'cleck this morninr
President Roosevelt boarded the Slyph
in Oyster Bay. He was accompanied by
Mrs. Roosevelt and their son Kermit,
Mrs. Richardson, a New York friend of
Mrs. Roosevelt; Secretary Loeb. Profes
sor Albert Bushnell Hart of Harvard Col
lege. Professor J. B. Moore of Columbia
University. C r Grant Lafarge of New
Tork and Jacob" A. Rlis of Richmond
Hill. Long Island. In addition the Pres
ident's guests Included members of tha
executive staff and representatives of the
press associations.
ENCOUNTERS THE STORM.
When the Sylph weighed anchor the
skies werfe dark and forbfddlng, and as
the vessel drew out of the bay c. light
rain fell. Less than an hour after the
Sylph had entered Long Island Sound â¢hs
ran into a terrific wind and rainstorm.
The storm Increased In se\-erlty rapidly
and off Kort Schuyler it developed Into a
hurricane. The wind blew, according to
an estimate made by Lieutenant Preston,
commander of the S^iph. at the rate cf
sixty-five miles an hour.
The Sylph, a comparatively small ves
sel, pitched heavily and off Wlllets Point
listed J very sharply to starboard. The
President And his guests had been forced
to go below and beyond a drenching none
of them suffered Inconvenience.
The storm became even more severe as
the vessel neared Hell Gate. The waves
and wind stv-ept the deck, making it al
most impossible for the sailors to remain
exposed to their force. The baggage of
the party, consisting principally of hat
boxes and dress suit cases, was swept
about the deck and everything movabla
on deck had to be clewed down to prevent
Its being swep* overboard-
TUG SINKS NEAR SYLPH.
In Hell Gate, a quarter of a mild off
the port bow of the Sylph, a tugboat hav
ing In tow a large three-masted schooner
was capsized by the wind and waves. She
sank stern foremost, bjit did not settlo
completely out of sight for perhaps five
minutes. Uentenant Preston wished to
stand by to render such assistance to thÂ»
tug crew as he could, but Captain Will
iam H. Brainard, an experienced pilot,
who was at the wheel, declared it would
be foolhardy for the Sylph to attempt a
rescue In such a storm: that she almost
certainly would be wrecked herself in the
attempt. President Roosevelt knew noth
ing of the capsizing of the tugboat unttl
nearly an hour afterward. He then ex
pressed the wish that some assistance
might have been rendered the crew.
It was the expectation that Mrs. Roose
velt. Mrs. Richardson and some of the
guests of the President conld be landed
at Twenty-third street, Mrs. Roosevelt
desiring to pass the day In the city with
relatives. Owing to the severity of thÂ«
storm, which waa still rasing with furious
energy, it was . found impracticable to
make a landing at that point. The naval
tug Powhattan, In command of Lieuten
ant Commander Pundstone'. ran alongside
the Sylph. Commander Pundstone sug
gested that a landing be made at the
Brooklyn Navy Yard. Lieutenant Pres
ton reported to the President the absolute
impracticability of proceeding to Ellis
Island in the face of the storm. He was
supported In his judgment by Lieutenant
Commander Pundstone. who megaphoned
that it would be impossible to effect a
landing at the island in such a gale. Very
reluctantly President Roosevelt consented
to abandon for the day his trip to the
immigrant station. Mrs. Roosevelt. Mrs.
Richardson, Kermit Roosevelt. -Professor
Moore. Professor Hart and Mr. Lafarge
were landed at the Brooklyn Navy' Tar*.
Rear Admiral Rogers, commandant or
the navy yard, went aboard the Sylph
and. the storm having abated, It was de
cided that the trip to the island could bÂ«
made in safety.
At 2:06 the 8ylph again weighed anchor
and arrived oft Ellis Island at t:C ,Th*
President and his party wer* safely
in the Flatlron Itself forty windows
Were smashed. - Occupants of the build-
Ing- said* they felt the huge structure
sway in the gale and many .were so bad
ly scared that' they left the building. An
express' wagon was * blown J over while
turning the Flatlron corner and the driv
er and James Billing's, who waa crossing
the avenue, were both seriously hurt, a
score of others were more or less injured
In this neighborhood.
-" Scores of plate glass windows along
Broadway . were broken, the vicinity of
the Flatlron building at Twenty-third
street suffering severely in this respect
on. the center of the city, loosening the
250-foot spire of St. Bartholomew's Pro
testant Episcopal Church on Madison
avenue.
â¢ The steeple of the South Congregational
Church in Brooklyn also was loosened.
Trees were torn up and the streets of the
city were littered with signs and um
brellas of unfortunate pedestrians who
happened to be out in the fury of the
storm. Telegraph and telephone wires
above ground were broken in all parts of
the metropolis.
The tugboat James Kay was blown on
Hogs Rock in Hell Gate and completely
wrecked. The captain and crew saved
themselves by swimming toward the Isl
and. The streets of Manhattan, borough
were 1 strewn with broken signs and other
debris.
' The approaching campaign will be the
subject of the keenest military Interest,
not Â¦ alone in France but to all Europe.
Nothing is known and much is suspected
regarding the effectiveness of the ma
chinery and personnel of the French
army. It has had no real test.
The conquest of Morocco will not be
child's play, although it involves nothing
approaching in magnitude the task which
Great Britain assumed with a light heart
when she sent General Buller with 50,000
men to subdue the Boers.
The concession, was made by the Brit
ish authorities at the time of the visit of
President Loubet to the King In Ust
July, and Delcasse brought back with
him to Paris the consent of Lord Lans
downe as' the greatest coup of bis admin
istration.
This ambition of r'rance 13, of course,
well known and well understood. "What
is not well known and will not be easily
understood is that Great Britain has con
sented >to stand aside and to abandon her
almost traditional attitude of protection
of the royal prerogatives of the Sultan
of this African kingdom.
. Less than ten years ago Gnat Britain
would not have hesitated to make war
with France, if necessary, in defense of
the integrity of Morocco. The Sultan, as
late as the spring of the present year.
relied . with absolute confidence upon
British support. Whether he has yet be
come aware of ita withdrawal has not
transpired.
The explanation of this radical change
of policy on the part of the British Gov
ernment is only partially clear. It has at
first glance the appearance of another
"cave," and a weak one at that. Its mo
tive, however, is undoubtedly the new
effort which. Britain is making to divorce
France' from her alliance with Russia.
PARIS. Sept:- 18.â Preparation* are al
ready well advanced for the next war
of conquest in" which a great power will
engage. .The French Government has de
termined to co'nquer and annex . Morocco
and operations on an extensive scale prob
ably will be begun within a. few weeks.

OGDEX, Utah. Sept. 16.â It devel
oped to-day that the flght over
the . proposition to commit the
National Irrigation Congress in
favor of a repeal of several ot
the existing land laws, including the des
ert land act, the timber and stone act
and the commutation clause of the home
stead act, will be a very close one. â¢ Cham
pions both for and against such action
were heard at to-day's session of the con
gress/George H. Maxwell of the execu
tive committee of the National Irrigation
Association and Senator Paris Gibson of
Montana favoring such action, while Con
gressman Mondell in a lengthy speech
took strong grounds against such repeal.
Both the repeal resolutions Introduced by
Mr. Maxwell and the speeches of Sen
ator Gibson and Congressman Mondell
were much applauded and it was evident
from the feeling displayed that if the
"congress does recommend the repeal of
these laws, and It Is ger.-.-.l belief that
the committee on resolutions will report
in favor of such resolutions, that, it will
only be after a very hard fight. Interest
in the possible action of the congress on
this DOint. in fact, overshadows every
thing elf>e that has come before it.
HARD WORK FOR DELEGATES.
This was a day of hard work for the
delegates. Besides listening to half a
dozen Interesting speeches, numerous res
olutions were Introduced and referred to
the resolutions committee, of which Sen
ator Smoot of Utah nas been elected
chairman.
Action, on the long considered . consoli
dation with the .Trans-Mississippi Com
mercial Congress was also taken. The
committee appointed last year to investi
gate the desirability of such affiliation
reported through lta chairman, . Senator
Carey of Wyomlr.g, against such action
on the ground that the time had now
come for action . and . the Irrigation Con
gress would best preserve its Individual
ity in the work It set out to do so many
years ago. The report was adopted unan
imously..
The , mor* "is: ' session of the congress
was devoted to colonization and the opin

and email stockmen were listened to with

. SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 16,â The peo
ple of San Jacinto, a little town southeast
of here, at the base of San Jacinto Peak,
have- just discovered the startling fact
that a leper has been mingling m their
midst for the last three months without
their knowledge. G. Li. GreenweU brought
the story to this city to-day.
Some time ago there arrived 'at San
Jacinto a Mr. and Mrs. John. McQuade,
who rented a cottage in the suburbs. He
was a' carpenter and -prosperity 'smiled
on" him from the. moment that he first
set his foot In the town. The couple
made frienfls, but no one ever caught a
glimpse of his wife's ; face, 6he 'always
appearing in the presence of others heav
ily veiled. The man explained this by
stating that she was bothered with a
painful rash, which, if exposed to the air,
would become the more : ". aggravated.
The other ' day two deputies from the
United States Marshal's 'Office; arrlvedin
town and on going* to *the housej^ccu
pled by the couple they found It" deserted.
After a Ions search they found- several
persons who had seen them' leave " the
evening before on the train. The of
ficers explained that Mrs. McQuade was
a leper. Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦
The couple were married in Chicago
several years ago, Where she had been
employed as a city school teacher. Sho
was regarded as an exceptionally bright
young woman and had received honors
from several leading seminaries in the
country. They had a desire to travel and
so set forth for the Orient. At Honolulu
McQuade was offered a position at a high
salary and concluded to settle there. Al
though he protested his wife secured an
appointment as principal of the native
schools, she having a desire to master
the language. This position brought her
in touch with lower classes and from
them she contracted the dread disease.
For a time she occupied a cottage in the
leper settlement, her home being built for
her especially,- and In an isolated place,
where she- would not come in contact
with the other lepers.

JAMES W. ERWIN. assistant super
intendent of city free delivery and
former postal Inspector, was for
mally arrested yesterdfcy afternoon
on the indictment charging him
with conspiracy to defraud the United
States Government and was at once . re
leased on bail. Immediately after the
service of the warrant he was' handed his
notice of removal from the postal service
of the United .States Government.
The service of the warrant took place
In the chambers of United States Com
missioner E. H. Heacock in. the Apprais
ers' building. Shortly after 2 o'clock the
accused entered the court room accom
panied by his attorney, Samuel Knight,
and his two bondsmen, Willis G. Witter
and Thomas Rickard. Among others
present interested in the case were United
States District Attorney Marshal B.
Woodworth, Postal Inspector James
O'Connell, United States Postofflce In
spector In Charge Robert R. Munro and
Deputy United States Marshal A. L..
Farish.
Judge Heacock allowed the accused
man to waive the reading of the warrant,
as all parties in interest were thoroughly
conversant with its contents. The Judge
stated there was no necessity of going
into the formality of identification of the
accused, as every one present knew him,
and there was no reason to instruct him
regarding his rights as to securing an at
torney, as he had already provided him
self in that respect. This ended the for
mal ceremony of the service of the war
rant.
Attorney Knight asked that the case be
set for hearing on September 25, as by
that time he thought the defense would
have ample time to prepare its case. The
Judge stated that his calendar was
pretty well filled up, but that he thought
Insomuch as the accused was anxious
for a hearing at as early a date as possi
ble he would arrange to meet the request
of Attorney Knight and the case was ac
cordingly set to be heard at that time at
10 a. m.
Attorney Knight brought up the ques
tion of the amount of bonds required for
his client, and being Informed by the
Judge that $5000 was the amount required
by the United States Government Knight
said his client was ready to furnisb/rthe
amount, and the bond was forthwith pre
pared and duly signed by his bondsmen,
Willis G. Witter and Thomas Rickard.
Just as Erwin arose and was preparing
to leave the court room Postal Inspector
Munro stepped forward and handed him
his letter of dismissal from the service of
the Government. It read as follows:
Office of the Postmaster General, Washington,
D. C., September 9, 1903. .
Sir: You are hereby removed from the posi
tion of assistant superintendent city free deliv
ery, said removal to become effective on the
date of the delivery of thla letter to you. Very
respectfully,
H. C. PATNE, Postmaster General.
Erwin accepted the letter and after
"The Utility of Public Grazing Lands"
waa discussed by W. M. Woodridge of
Hunsdale, Mont.
Adjournment was taken until 9:30 to

The highest. idea of ancient Hebrew prophets
was the coming of the mlllenium, when the
earth should be the final abode of a kingdom of
peace. These prophecies constitute the basis
of the exalted poetry of our language and bear
the charmed life of immortal youth.
If the Lord shall comfort Zion, he will com
fort all her waste places and he will make her
wilderness like Eden and her desert like the
garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be
found therein, thanksgiving and the voices of
melody. "I will open rivers in high places and
fountains In the midst of the valleys. I will
make the wilderness a pool of water and the
dry lands springs of water. I will plant fn the
wilderness the cedar and the myrrh and the oil
tree. I will set In the desert the fir tree and
the pine and the box trees together. The wild
erness and the solitary places shall be glad
for them, and the desert shall rejoice and blos
som as the rose."
The rioneers of- this State of Utah antici
pated the coming of this march of civilization
by more than half a century. Adherents of a
new religion, they encountered the repulsion
of the old. All religious beliefs are faultless
only to those who believe 1n their Infallibility,
and whatever else may be said of the faith
which brought the pioneers of this State to
the very heart of a vast desert, it cannot be
said that It was wanting in the power to at
tract and hold the martyrllke devotion of its
adherents. They found here an arid desert;
they converted It into a fertile garden, and the
achievement of this miracle is referable to the
magic of Irrigation.
Standing in the very center of the vast terri
tory about to be reclaimed from aridity to fer
tility, it is eminently fitting that our delibera
tions shall promote the full fruition of that con
quest. We stand on the threshold of a coming
empire. Here fertility, bound in the chains of
aridity, has awaited the awakening influence
of energy, enterprise and capital. That the
national irrigation law will be the magic rod
of Moses Is our devout hope.

Joundation of that great commonwealth waa
laid upon lines so broad as to admit of no other
than a nobli* superstructure; and this unprece
dented.instance of the community lite of Houth
crn ralifprn;a and the exaltation or civilized
conditions there, which have known rto primi

the entire superstructure stands upon the ad

that portion due to irrigation and its splendid

original condition of arid solitude.
When the national irrigation law received the
Fignature of President Roosevelt the United
States prepared to make an onward and an up
ward step in national progress. Territorial ag
grandizement by conquest may be the beginning
of Industrial and commercial expansion, but the
nation which seeks expansion through the evo
lutionary development of Its inherent capabili
ties has chosen a nobler and surer highway of
success. The arid region of the United States,
comprising the territory lying west of the 100th
meridian, embraces 1,700,000 square miles. If
armies had been set in the field for the acquisi
tion of an eÂ«jual area of territory we would
have regarded it ae a formative event in the
history of the nation; but the national Irriga
tion law is the beginning of a peaceful terri
torial conquest of far-reaching significance. No
war In which any nation has ever been en
gaged !s fraught with such prophesy of bril
liant achievement in the great office of extend
ing our national possibilities or of broadening
the basis of our civilization. This Is a conquest
which involves no expeditures of vast sums of
money in wasteful extravagances of war, nor
yet the shedding of blood, and Its ultimate
achievement will be a victory of peace whose
6plendor, if less picturesque, will not be less
renowned than war.

The valley of the Po furnished informatory
illustration of this. In the three provinces of
Lombardy. Piedmont and Venice comprising
the valley of the Po and Its confluents, there
are 3,(Xrf>,000 of acres of land under irriga
tion. The population of the region, based
uiÂ»on the productive capacity of. the soil whose
natural production is re-endorved by the con
trol of this single facton. Is over 8,000,000 in
habitants. The climatic conditions of the Po
are not favorable to a wide diversity of ob
jects of cultivation. Only in especially fa
vored regions of very limited area is the
production of eeml-troplc&l plants possible.
Throughout the major portion of this irrigated
area the thermometer descends to 10 degrees,
maintaining that temperature a sufficient
length of time to control the character of the
flora; and yet 8,000,000 Inhabitants find abund
ant subsistence . In this favored region solely
because one of the paramount factors of pro
duction is under the control of man
Let us contrast this with the conditions in
the great Sacramento Valley in our State of
California. The Sacramento Valley has a fer

soil of unsurpassed fertility and It lies under
a climate conferring the widest range of agri
culture and horticulture possibilities. The
temperature of that great valley seldom de
scends to 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and in fifty
years' observation has not fallen below 20 de
gree*. Like the valley of the Po. local con
figuration confers variety of conditions which
must be intelligently mastered if errors of
cultivation would be avoided. But when the

area, fertility and climatic possibilities, the

With the factor of moisture under the con
trol of man. his control over the creation of
wealth is vastly enhanced. Civilization is
based upon the existence of wealth, since em
pires are based upon population. With one
of the three factors of production under his
control man can by his will create states,
and in the exercise of this pdwer he does
most truly resemble the gods. In the ancient
world the greatest density of population was
found in regions originally desert, because in
euch regions fertility can be evoked only by
resort to irrigation, and â¢wherever Irrigation
is resorted to the density of population, the
existence of great wealth and of empire are
found.
BASE OF CIVILIZATION.
Perhaps tho most noted instance of success
ful apriculture In the world relates - to the
great valley of the Po,, a valley representing
a broad i-tretch of fertile plains between the
Aprennir.cs and the Alps in Northern Itaiy.
HÂ»to irrigation has found its hlgh'-st demon-
Uratici. of value; and yet. the valley of the
Vo is not in any reEpect deficient in precipita
tion of moisture. The annual rainfall of that
valley very greatly exceeds that of many por
tions of the earth wh^re heretofore the declar
ation of the necessity of irrigation would be
regarded as absurd, in the extreme. ....
Cut Irrigation has other uses and other ob
jects than merely' supplying deficiency of
moisture: one of its most beneficial uses is
the distribution of the moisture throughout the
>Â«ar. There are but few portions of the oarth
where the annual rainfall is economically dis
tribute! throughout all reasons; fully 80 per
cent of the earth's surface is subject â¢ to ir
regular meteoro!offiral conditions, and these
undirected conditions arc wholly inadequate to
the necessities of man. The human race has
long since passed the stage where natural con
ditions may be depended upon for evÂ«n a bare
(subsistence. Fertility, temperature and moist
ure are the three prime factors of production.
If these three were under the absolute control
cf man the great fundamental problems of
civilization would have been mastered. Irri
gation may be depended upon to solve two cf
thfst â moisture and fertility.
With the element of moisture under his con
trol man has maFtered two of the three great
forces cf production. Scientific irrigation is
absolutely indispensable to scientific agricul
ture. Dependence upon the natural precipita
tion of any country is at best a barbarism.
Just as we have been obliged to no longer
depend upon the spontaneous production of th*
t-arth to sustain life, so we will have to aban
don our dependence upon natural precipitation
as a productive force in every cu'.tivated. coun
try. Irrigation, with Its concomitant, drain
age, is therefore as important in one portion
of the world as another. It has acquired a
FeÂ«>mins Importance, however. in what is
known as arid regions where the absence of
moisture is so plainly obvious.
THE VALLEY OF THE PO.
In some of the valleys of our great State of
California the observation of a series of years
demonstrates a greater loss from excessive
moisture than from deficiency. In the progress
of scientific agriculture :t is just as important
that man should control the destructive condi
tions, in order to modify them at either end
of the^e extremes. Any proper system of Ir
rigation Is of necessity, accompanied by a
system of drainage. It is for this reason that
irrigation is equally as valuable In countries
of heavy precipitation aÂ» in countries where
the meteorological conditions nre such as to
deny sufficient rainrall for the annual ma
turity of crops.
In a deliberative body, convened for the pur
pose of considering the single subject, some
reference to elemental principles cannot be
inappropriate. Plant food is found in the soil
by the operation of the law known to science
as "elective absorption." The soil has but the
slnple instinct of holding on to this plant food,
nor does it yield any of its food to the plant
in a saturated condition cf less than ten de
grees. When that degree of saturation is
reached the plant is stronger than the soil and
growth ensue?. This plant food is deposited
through the soil by the asrency of percolating
currents. By this law cf elective absorption
the soil takes from the water the elements of
plant life, which is yielded up and which is
deposited in the soil only by the perpetual
movements of subsurface percolation. While
the scil begins to yield its plant food to the
plant life whose roots penetrate the soil at ten
degrees of saturation, it very soon reaches a
degree of saturation wherein dilution is as de
structive to vegetation as aridity. If man
would have control of this paramount factor
of moisture he must tmve equal control ever
excessive as well as deficient moisture; drain
age is, therefore, a concomitant of irrigation.

tion of that moisture to the actual necessities
of plant life.
BALTIMORE, Md., Sept. 16.â The "Dem

George T. Atkinson of Somerset County;
Attorney General, William Shapehard
Brjan of Baltimore.
The' face issue plank, which. is regarded
as the most important in the platform,
declares for white supremacy in State,
county and municipal government. The
clause relating to the race question is as
foliows:
tVe beliex-e that the political destinies of
Maryland should be ehap<ed and controlled by
the white people of the State, and while we
disclaim any purpose to do any injustice
whatever to our colored population, we de
clare without reserve our resolute purpose to

As the President was passing through
the room ip which, women who had been
excluded were being detained temporar
ily a pathetic Incident occurred.' An el
derly woman approached him, crying out
pitifully. The President inquired about
the case and Jearned that the woman
had heen detained at the prison since
July 30. On that date she, with her hus
band and four children, arrived from
Russia. The husband and one child had
come over as second " cabin passengers
probably because they knew they were
afflicted with a disease which would bar
their admission 'to this country from the
steerage, while the woman and the other
three children were ' steerage passengers.
The husband and one child escaped "from
the ship. Although the evidence showed
that the woman had a son in this coun
try engaged in a profitable business, she
and her three children were held up. Â¦
After the facts had been" developed, the
President announced ;that there' could' be
no possible reason for detaining the wo
man'longer, and it was evident she and
her children were financially able to care
for themselves. The case, however. Is
pending on appeal before Secretary, Cor
telyou of the Department of Commerce
and Labor, and he doubtless will release
the woman in accordance with the Judg
ment of the President.
At 7 o'clock to-night the President, ac

I Despite the furious storm, a large party
assembled . at the Island to greet the
President. He was welcomed by Com
missioner of Immigration Williams.
Before beginning his tour of inspection
of the station President Roosevelt inform
ed Commissioner- Williams that it would
be Impossible for .him to make such an
inspection as he would like in the lim
ited time at hie disposal. Commissioner
Williams then requested the President to
appoint a commission to make a complete
Inspection. The President named 'as- the
commission Eugene . A. Philbin, Thomas
Hynes, Arthur von Briesen and Ralph
Trautman. The. commission will report
personally to the President at the conclu
sion of its investigation.
During the afternoon many interesting 1
incidents occurred, the President acting
on his desire to go directly among immi
grants themse.ves with a view of ascer
taining how they were treated.-. He
was particularly interested by the fact
developed that the majority of the ap
plicants for admission were supplied with
American money. The statement waa
made by the- immigration officials that
immigrants passed at the station carried
at the average aggregate $8,000,000 a year
In American currency. ;
The President's interest was attracted,
by a comely German woman, Adele Wal
ter from Leutendorf,.who bore In a wick

moment with her the President slipped
a five-dollar bill into her hand. She. was
greatly affected on learning that the gift
was from the President of the United

FRESNO. Sept. 16.â Leo Splvey, wanted
for murder. In Jackson, Caps Glrardeau
County, Mo., was arrested this morning
and is in the County Jail awaiting the ar
rival of the Sheriff from Jackson, Mo.
The crime with which Spivey Is charged
is a particularly .atrocious one, the vic
tim's head, it is said, having been severed
from the body. The murder was commit
ted on May 15. ' :â
Spivey has been in the mountains work-
Ing at Bennett's Mills and came to town
last Sunday, since which time he has been
under surveillance. He went here under
the name of "Fred Turpin:" In the room
at the hotel where he stopped was found
a suit of clothes which in detail an
swered the description of the garments
worn by Spivey, as noted in the circular
sent out by the Sheriff ot Cape Glrardeau
County. Spivey eluded the trail of the
Sheriff's officers this morning for a time,
but when he was arrested* It was in the
act of paying his hotel bill before depar
ture from town. After having been taken
into custody he admitted that he is the
man wanted for the Missouri murder. The
only, detail that he denied was that he
severed, his victim's head from the body.
Sheriff Collins did not have a printed
description of Spivey, such as is usually
sent out. by Sheriffs when a criminal is
wanted. He says that he had a "tip"
that- Spivey was working at the Bennett
Mills up in the mountains and had him
watched till he came to thi city. Then
he wired Sheriff Schade at Jackson, Mo.,
giving a description of the man and stat
ing that he had him under surveillance.
Schade wired back: "Arrest Leo Spivey
on sight. Will come with the proper pa
pers immediately." There is a reward of
$500 offered for the capture if Spivey.

The climax came when Attorney John

long and exasperating cross-examination,
popped the following query:

Twice did the pugnacious attorney for the
prosecution offer to meet either of the de

rules and warm words were exchanged
between the attorney and Williams which
threatened for a. time to bring the offtred
opportunity *o a sudden acceptance before
the bar of justice.
THE dignity of Judge SIoss' court
room came dangerously near to
being disrupted yesterday by a
free-for-all fight between Attorney
After the closing of the testimony, Hi
ram Johnson renewed the motion ' pre
viously entered In the early part of the
trial to strike out all the testimony re
lating to mitigating circumstances as be
ing utterly at- variance with the plea of
self-defense, which the defense is stand-
Ing upon.- Judge SIoss took the matter
under advisement and will announce his
decision to-day when the trial is re
sumed. :
"And you hit a defenseless man on
the head with a revolver in his own house
andwithin call of his wife and children?"
Beale replied Indignantly that he be
lieved Marriott to be armed or he would
not have taken such measures. Williams
intervened at this juncture, and after the
Judge had straightened matters out the
taking of testimony proceeded more
peacefully until the defense had closed
its case.
'Well, I did not know to what a pass
our Interview might come," replied the
witness.
Beale had little more success at keep
ing his temper than Williams. Upon di
rect testimony he related a story which
tallied with that of Williams in every
particular. When Johnson took hold of
him trouble commenced almost at once.
"Did you take a gun out to Marriott's
house because you were afraid of him?"
asked Johnson.
arousing his ire evidently to the strain
ing point. Williams would not admit that
he accompanied Beale to the house of
the editor to act as a referee. He also
stoutly asserted that he only fired upon
Marriott when he thought that he him
self was in danger of being shot down.
BEALE SUFFEBS ALSO.
Johnson repeated the ' question with
measured cadence. Williams' temper
snapped. "You are very dense, Mr. John
son." said- he. Johnson continued his
cross-questioning to great length, failing
to catch the witness In any material
points of his testimony, but succeeded In
"When you. Thomas -H. Williams, ranp
up Mr. Marriott from your home and said
over the telephone that- It, was Truxtun
Deale who was talking, that wa3 not the
truth, was it?"
"It- was the 'truth -in that I was acting
as the asent of Beale."
When Williams was turned over to
Johnson It soon became evident that the
clash which occurred between the two in
the rriminnl trial before Judge Cook
would be flupllcatcd in- even a more viru
lent degree. Â¦
"Are you armed with your 44-callber
revolver and your dagger ' at : present?"
t arked the attorney.,- - â¢
"No; for vmir. benefit I left them * at
home, Mr. Johnson," suavely replied Wil
liams.
Williams maintained that Beale did not
strike the first blow in the struggle which
took place in the hallway of Marriott's
house, but that he only struck to defend
himself. When Marriott- was running- up
the flairs, Williams asserted, the editor
paused near the top and made a demon
stration as if to draw a revolver, and' it
was at that moment that he shot likewise
in self-defense.. â¢ .; . ,tv
WIIXIA.MS NOT ARMED.
Bernard Jeffrey, who was. at the time of
the shooting a reporter of 'The Call and
had been detailed to interview Mrs. Mar
riott on tha night of the shooting; then
substantiated the story told by the police
officers, and Frederic . Bishop, who was
acting city editor of Tho Call on the
nipht of the assault." tola of rpeeivirjr a
telephone message from Mrs. Marriott in
which the same tale .was repeated.
Thomas Williams then took the stand
in hfs own behalf. To the' direct question
ing: of Ms- attorney he pave a detailed ac
count of the affairs of the night in which
the editor of the News Letter had been
assaulted by himself and Beale. The wit
ness alluded to. the alleged defamatory
article which had appeared in the News
Letter against the affianced wife of Beale
and to the effect which It had upon both
the lady In question and his friend. He
next told of how Beale had stated a de
termination to demand a retraction from
Marriott and of their trip to Marriott's
house on the night of September 3.
The case opened In the morning with
the examination of- Detective Thomas
Gibson. Attorney Dunne elicited from
him the fact that to him Mrs.
Marriott made the . same statements
as she had to the two other members of
the police force to the effect that she
heard five shots altogether and that sEe
was In the nursery until after the third
had been fired. Upon cross-examination
Gibson admitted that when tVilliams was
arrested at the Pacific Union Club no ef
fort was made to relieve, him of the
weapon with which he ;iad done .the
shooting and that no memorandum of
v.hat Mrs. Marriott Eaid -about the affray
had ever been turned in to Chief of De
toctlves Martin.
TESTIFY FOR DEFENSE.
Thfi Williams, who was sitting behind
Dunne, his counsel, came to the rescue of
his co-defendant.
"Are you a lawyer or a prize fighter?"
asked Williams.
Johnson uncorked the vials of his accu
mulated wrath. Turning to where Wil
liams was sitting he shook his finger at
him savagely and delivered himself:
"Well, possibly I am enough of both to
take on either you or Mr. Beale, or both
if you will come at me from the frent."
Disorder reigned for a minute and then
the Judge admonished the combatants
that he would tolerate no more such
scenes.

"That is false. I have admitted nothing
of the kind," returned Beale hotly. -
"It is not falseâ that, truth is shown by
the testimony," vociferated Johnson,
squaring his shoulders at the witness.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 16.âBurg
lars some time during last night entered
the Wells-Fargo express office here and
robbed the safe of $1049 in coin and cur
rency. The rear door was entered with
a key and the safe opened In the regular
way, by the combination, which was
found in a book in a drawer of one of
the desks In the office. About $300 locked
in a separate compartment of the safe
was overlooked by the burglars. The,
rear door was fitted with a Yale lock.
There were no marks of violence on the
door or safe, nor any evidence of confu
sion in the office. .
| The burglary was first discovered by
Horace Stewart, son of Sheriff NaUStew
art, who is one of the office messengers
and usually is the first to arrive/at the
office in the morning. Entering the back
door as usual, Stewart was surprised to
find the door open and proceeding toward
the front office, he discovered the safe
door swung wide open. Closing the of
fice he went to the hotel where Acting
Agent Adams stays and informed him of
the robbery. The affair was immediately
put into the hands of the Sheriff, who is
now working on the case. The manner
of tho burglary tends tq make it appear
that the haul was made through the con
nivance of some one who had accurate
knowledge, of the inside workings of the
office. The regular agent of the office Is
P. B. Yates, now in Los Angeles on a va
cation and who is, expected back to-mor

Such symptoms, it was added by Dr.
Webster, are common in appendicitis.
What shall be the precise line of treat
ment pursued in the case of Sir Thomas
is declared to be purely a matter for
speculation as yet, despite the fact that
his disease has yieided to diagnosis.
Immediately after the examination to
night Sir Thomas fell into a doze, out
of which he did not awake for several
hours. According to the physicians, the
Irish baronet slept most of yesterday.
This may have been due to the fact that
opiates were almost constantly adminis
tered to him to ease the Intense pain he
was undergoing.
All of the members of Sir Thomas' suite
passed an anxious day and evening. De
spite the assurances of the physicians
that while the patient's condition was se
rious it was as yet in no way critical
they were much worried. Many telegrams
of sympathy were received by Sir Thomas
to-day.
The symptoms noted in the examination
of Sir Thomas are described by Dr. Web
ster as follows:
We found that our patient was suffering: from
pains of an Intense and colicky nature in the
region of the appendix, that there was muscular
rigidity on the right side of the body and local
ized pain and pressure, accompanied by fever.
At midnight Dr. Webster said that it
had not yet been determined whether an
operation to remove the vermiform ap
pendix would be necessary. In its pres
ent stage thÂ« baronet's ailment is de
scribed as "catarrhal" appendicitis, in
which there is inflammation of the ap
pendix, unaccompanied by the formation
of pus or abscess. Should suppuration
ensue, says the physician, an operation
miRht be unavoidable, while in any case
it is far from being an unlikely mode of
treatment.
The foregoing was given out after a
second consultation held by the physi
cians. Another conference and examina
tion were held to-night, and at 11 p. m.
the followins bulletin was issued:

The arrest has caused much talk In
Chinatown and the Suey Duna have an
nounced their Intention of declaring war
against the Hop Sings.
'. Chinatown has more trouble. Last night
Suey Lew, a woman who resides in Baker
alley, was arrested and taken to Chlco
and the warrant on which she was taken
Is said to have been sworn out for no
other purpose than to wrest the woman
from the clutches of her friends and then
to kidnap her. â¢ .
The transaction on Its face seems noth
ing more than the old trick of a trumped
up charge and is likely to end in war be
tween the Suey Dun Tong, of which sfie
is a member, and the : IIop Sing Tong,
which, it is alleged, caused her arrest.
She ia accused of grand. larceny commit
ted a few days ago in Chlco and her
friends and many who know her in Chi
natown will swear that she has not been
out of this city within the last three
years. It Is said that the Hop Sings In
Chlco have been endeavoring for some
time to' secure possession of the girl and,
failing In other ways, resorted to the
warrant trick to get her within the
bounds of their own camp. The warrant
was brought to this city by Constable
Heldtnan and with the assistance of De
tective Gibson It was served last evening
shortly before the Oregon Express de
parted from the mole. In this manner
the woman's friends were given no .op
portunity to come to her assistance, to
interview her or to furnish bonds. After
she reaches Chlco she will appear before
a magistrate and, it is probable, the
charges will be found to be false. Then,
after her release, she will be kidnaped
and hidden from her city friends. '

TONGS MAY WAR
OVER A WOMAN
ventlon, arose to a question of privilege
and surprised the convention by his
scathing rebuke to Thomas W. Hickey,
chairman of the Democratic Municipal
Convention. His speech was as follows:
I rise to a question of privilegeâ a question
of privilege -concerning this entire convention.
If the press reports of the proceedings of
Gavin McXab's so-called convention on last
Monday- night are true, and l presume they
are, the chairman of that convention made. In
an exhibition of unspeakable cheek and in
sufferable gall, an unwarranted and uncalled
for attack upon the integrity of .this conven
tion. ' We are Informed by Mr. Thbmas Hickey
that the Union Labor party has been delivered
Into the hands of Republican politicians and
that we are now a part and parcel of the
Republican organization of this city.' It may
be â there may be some deluded friends of
labor who may be deceived and take seriously
the remarks of Mr. Hickey, but If they â¢un
derstood his motives, ' as the most ordinary
laymen in political affairs In San | Francisco
understand- them, .they -would pay no heed to
them, and I want to inforni air,. Hickey that
the laboring man of San "Francisco is com
petent to Judge for himself. (Applause.) ' And
the delegates . of the convention will afford
them ample opportunity by . our acts to Judge
and determine whether a convention consti
tuted as this is, composed of the loyal rep
resentatives of the various labor unions of
San Francisco, -could or would stan-1 for any
, thing that is not for tha best interests of
labor and the people of this entire community.
(Applause;)
- If Gavin McNab'a mouthpiece had cause to
think â If his mind had \ not been asleep at
the switch (laughter), his tongue would not
have run him off the track of fact and reason,
and I want to further Inform Mr. Hickey that
this convention has done no act cf any kind
which would warrant him or any
'other spokesman of Gavin McNab in' making
i such assertion. This convention has started
out to perform Us duties to the laboring man
and the entire people of San Francisco by
following that course laid down in our plat
form and declaration of principles which have
been so honestly and efficiently illustrated for
the last twenty months in official' life by our
gallanjf leader, our faithful . representative : of
organized labor, the honorable Mayor of all
the Â¦ lteople of . San Franciscoâ Eugene E.

PHELANISM' AND : M'NABISM.
Where, when and by whom was Tom Hickey
â a man who never did a day's wcrk In his
life (lauEhter). constituted an authority on
what the Union Labor party may do or may
not do in this campaign? We seek the In
spection of labor and the citizens of San
FrancUco as to our acts and we will answer
to them for the sincerity of our mrrtives; 'We

who stand for McNabism or Phelanlgm, ' and

BETTTBN OF FvEBDHTAJNT)
A Vienna paper asserts that Prince Fer
dinand of Bulgaria hafl sent a trusted
agent to King Peter, inviting co-operation
against Turkey.
The correspondent in Sofia of the Dally
Telegraph says that Bulgaria's reply to
the Porte's protest against the continual
crossing of the frontier by bands and the
smuggling of arms and ammunition from
Bulgaria was couched in most uncom
promising language, leaving no prospect,
whatever, of an amicable arrangement.
The Sofia correspondent of the Times
says that the decision of Bulgaria to par
tially mobilize the army Is universally ap
proved. It Is urged that the troops will
be exclusively designed to close the fron
tier against the passage of Insurgent
bands and that the step was resorted to in
obedience to the dictates of the great
Powers. The- decision-, therefore, should
not offend Turkey's susceptibilities.
It is estimated that 8000 raiders are pre
paring to start Into Macedonia or are al
ready assembled in the frontier districts
of Kostcndil and Dubnltza.
Most of the special. correspondents' In
the near East consider war Inevitable, but
think It may yet be delayed, neither the
Bulgarians nor the Turks being really
prepared for it. Tho former are not suffi
ciently armed, while Turkey does not .feel
safe until her lines of communication are
less at the mercy of Bulgarian Insurgent
bands.

The Daily Chronicle-, says- it understands
that Great Britain has decided upon a
still stronger step, in the dispatch of a
British squadron In support of her diplo
matic endeavors in Constantinople to put
an end to the massacres. It is impossible,
however, to confirm or deny the Daily
Chronicle's statement.
The chairman explained that some one
had Issued a card which contained 'mis
directions to" voters and which wouia
cause a loss of many votes to the Union
Labor party.
The minutes of the previous meeting
and the roll call were dispensed with in
order that the convention might get down
to business. The chairman announced
that at the initial session of the conven
tion he had been empowered to appoint a
committee of eighteen to select nominees
for Supervisors. He said this was a most
important piece of work and after consul
tation with the Mayor he thought it best
that the delegates select the committee.
He asked that each district name a man

opposition to Phelan and McXablsm Is an un

labor In San Francisco; I want, to Inform htm
further that the Union Labor party has come
to stay (great applause) and the culmination
of its career will never occur whlltf a vestige

political life in San Francisco. (Great ap
plauee and cries of "Good boy.")
When the cheering had subsided Frank
I. Carney moved a suspension of the
rules in order that the following resolu
tions might be read:
"Whereas, The platform of the Union Labor
party contains the following provision: '*\V>
favor a constitutional amendment which shall
make It Impossible for State Boards of Equali
zation arbitrarily to raise the assessment , of
this city, already overassessed, especially as re
gards its smaller property holders," and
Whereas, Since the adoption of said platform
the State Board of Equalization has unjustly
and arbitrarily raised the already high assess
ment of San Francisco property 30 per cent, to
the great Injury and loes of every owner of
real and personal property In San Francisco,
therefore be 'it i ""â¢'â¢'*
Resolved by the Union Labor party of San
Francisco, in . convention assembled, That the
action of the State Board of Equalization in
thus arbitrarily raisins the assessment In Sa,n
Francisco Is an outrasre and merits the severest
condemnation; further-.' â¢,. - -
Resolved, That the chairman of this conven
tion appoint a committee of eighteen, one from

purpose of devising a plan to prevent the con
summation of this outrage on the peonjg of

Resolved, That this convention cordially and
unreservedly Indorses all the propositions now

Resolved, That the attention of all voters of

fact that registration for the municipal elec

BULGARIA IS FIRM.
Refuses to Postpone the Mobilization
of Her Forces.
SOFIA, Sept. 16.â Althoueh no formal re
plies xiave Deen received to the Bulgarian
Government's note, it is said that the rep
resentatives of three great powers have
requested their Consuls to Bulgaria to re
main quiet as, in the evpnt of a war with
Turkey, Bulgaria need not expect any help
in foreign quarters. It is further reported
that the same diplomats visited General
Petroff and endeavored to persuade him to
postpone the mobilization of Bulgarian
forces, but the Premier declined.
One of the ministerial organs, in an edi
torial on the Government's note, says it
hopes it will be the last time that the Bul
garian Government will issue a note. If
the powers do not intervene to restore
order in Macedonia, Bulgaria will under
take with the feeble force she possesses
to do what is expected of her and give
Europe the pleasure of witnessing a
bloody drama in Macedonia.
A telegram from Burgas says that a
general massacre is beginning through
out the district of. Losangrad. Turkish
troops and Bashi-BaEouks attacked a
Greek village near Losengraxl. killed
twenty-five peasants and destroyed the
church, schools and many houses. The
Turks attacked the village of Paulovo
and killed everybody they found on the
streets.
A fight Is reported from Petchonltza be
tween a band of 100 insurgents and 300
Turks. The insurgents, who occupied a
strong position, fired on the attacking
Turks, killing twenty-five.
A telegram from Uekub states thai the
mobilization of the Turkish army is pro
ceeding rapidly and dispatches from Con
stantinople assert that the military party
Is urging the Sultan to order his troops
to croES the Bulgarian frontier without
a declaration of war, which the party re
gards as unnecessary, inasmuch as Bul
garia is a vassal etate of Turkey. The
Sultan is said to be hesitating.

LONDON, Sept. 17.â The efforts of the
Powers, according to the latest telegrams,
are directed, both in Constantinople and
Sofia, toward an endeavor to avert war
It is stated that all the Embassadors In
Constantinople have drawp the Porte's at
tention to the danger of permitting a con-
gene E. Schmitz for Mayor, reas
sembled last night at Pioneer Hall, on
Fourth street and resumed the work of
placing a municipal ticket In the field.
The delegates were entertained by a
speech from Orator Tom Eagan, who
arose to a question of of privilege and
hurled back -at Orator Tom Hickey,
chairman of the Democratic Convention,
some Insults which the latter hurled at
the Labor party last Monday evening. It
is quite evident that the labor leaders are
not looking for any support In this cam
paign from the Gavln-McNab end of the
poor old Democratic party. Also it is ob
vious, according to the trend of Hickey
rhetoric, that the McXab Democrats are
not expecting much help from tne
Schmitz wing of the Labor party.
It was significantly remarked last night
by the Labor convention's nominee for
Public Administrator thai he was a friend
of Michael Casey and thai he hoped Casey
would get in behind the ticket. The sen
timent was applauded by several dele
gates. Philosophers say that "hope is the
medicine of the unhappy" and therefore
the inference is deducted that those who
hope for the second coming of Casey are
not quite happy.

CONSTANTINOPLE. Sept. 16.â Official
dispatches report that in an encounter

killed and a great number wounded. In
the same vilayet the insurgents set fire
to the village of Kachin. One hundred
and fifty houses were burned and six
women perished in the flames.
SALONICA, Sept. 16.â Insurgent bands
of 650 men were annihilated by the Turks
on September 11 between Iskib and Kra

railroad near Demorhlssar was repulsed
with loss.

hambra Theater next Wednesday evening.
It is exDected that the convention will
give ample time to the consideration of
the reports from the committees on plat
form and order of business. Nominations
may not be reached at the second session.
The number of aspirants in the field for
the various offices Indicates active con
tests. ; â¢. :.'
There are signs of a fight between Gen
eral E. S. Salomon and ex-Senator Frank
McGowan for the District Attorneyship.
The announcement In yesterday's Call
that Charles S. Laumeister had entered
the race as a candidate for the nomina
tion for Assessor caused no little com
ment in political circles. Washington
Dodge, who Is slated for renomlnatlon by
the manager of the Democratic conven
tion, expects the indorsement of the Un
ion Labor party, but thi3 expectation may
not be realized.
The Union Labor delegates are not man
ifesting any desire to help out the Demo
crats in this campaign. If Dodge fails
to Bet the labor indorsement Laumeister
will waUc hi3 log.

may get the nomination for Mayor. The
contest for the mayoralty nomination in
the Republican convention Is open to all
earners. There is no slate or programme.
General George Stone has many ardent
supporters, who maintain that the Re
publicans all along the line would cheer
fully support him. General Shafter also
has active and earnest supporters who
assert that his nomination would be
equivalent to his election. The supporters
of Henry J. Crocker are enterprising and
confident. They assert that he is pop
ular, well known and thoroughly fitted for
the office. It is a sure thins that thai
candidate for Mayor on the Republican,
ticket will be chosen by the delegates to
the Republican convention.
tor and Recorder were called for, but
were passed and will be made this even
ing. Nominations for Public Administra
tor were next called. for, and Chairman
Williams turned his eavel over to the
secretary In order to place the name of
J. J. Conley before the convention. In
his sDeech Mr. Williams said:
I rise to place In nomination for the office
of Public Administrator a man who has been
identified with labor and worked In the rank*
for thirty years. He has "held positions of
trust in labor organizations; has been presi
dent of the Plasterers' Union; has been busl
j ness agent for the Building Trades In this
city, prior to Â¦ the present, and only retired
when the organization of which he waa busi
ness agent ceased to exist. I take great pleas
ure In presenting the name of J J. Conley.
(Cheers.) -
ALLUDES TO CASEY.
Jphn P. Magee of the Thirty-third As
sembly District seconded the nomination
and made an unhappy allusion to Michael
Casey, whom the Schmitz end Is trying to
mollify and bring into its camp. Magee
said that Conley had been a victim of
Michael Casey, meaning that Casey had
turned Conley down. Ccnley was nomi
nated by acclamation and when called
upon for a speech took the opportunity
to correct the statement made by Magee.
*He thanked the delegates for the honor
conferred upon him and assured them fie
would make an active campaign for him
self, and the rest of the ticket. He said
Michael Casey and himself had had some
differences, but were the best of friends.
"I hope to see Mr. Casey come right be
hind this ticket as soon as he cornea from
the country." he said. "I am sure he
will, as he is that kind of a man." .
A recess was taken for fifteen minutes
in order to give the delegates some fresh
air. Upon reconvening nominations for
Sheriff and Assessor were called for and
both offices were passed.
Tim T. Trcacy. the contractor, was the
avowed candidate for Sheriff and he had
things tec himself until cx-Assemblyman
J. N. Copus bf the Thirty-second District
was put into the fight by his friends.
Copus, declined to run and it is now an
nounced that Treacy will not accept the
nomination.
DILLON FOR CORONER.
Willlam J. Mindham, an energetic youth
of the Twenty-eighth District, nominated
Dr. John F. Dillon for Coroner. Mind
ham possessed a loud voice, but created
much amusement by calling the delegates'
attention to the generosity of his candi
date. He paid Dr. Dillon some sincere
tributes. He told how the physician had
given his services to the poor without ac
cepting a dollar remuneration. He also
told of his giving drugs away to the fam
ilies of the union men *?ho were out on
strike. He told how well the doctor ran
for the office of Coroner at the last elec
tion and he prophesied that Dr. Dillon
would surely be elected this time. That
Dillon is a popular man is evidenced by
the splendid ovation he received when he
was escorted to the platform. He'was
nominated by acclamation and in his
speech of acceptance spoke for harmony
In the party and expressed the desire to
see the entire ticket elected. He accepted
the platform of his party and said he
would stand by his pledges. He assured
the delegates that he would be a Just
Coroner if elected and would do nothing
to cause any regret on the part of the
delegates who nominated him.
An adjournment was taken until to
night at 8 o'clock. The delegates will
meet In Pioneer Hall and nominate the
rest of the ticket.

~ FREDBICK FOB CLEBK.
It was decided- to go ahead with the
nominations for other officers. No -can
didate being offered for Auditor, that of
fice was passed, and nominations for
County Clerk were declared in order. E.
F. Meyer of the Thirtieth Assembly Dis
trict nominated Powel Fredrick. He
spoke in part as follows:
For the office of County Clerk I take great
pleasure In placing In nomination a man who
ha* been with this party since Its very begin
ning. It Is the greatest pleasure â not only for
myself, but on behalf of the delegates of the
Thirtieth Assembly Districtâ the district which
waa first organized as 'a Union Labor district,
the district which gave the largest majority
for the Hon. Eugene K. Schmitz, the district
which, at the last primary election, gave a vic
tory for the ticket which Is upholding the hands
of our Mayor. This district asks this conven
tion for the Indorsement of Powel Fredrick for
County Clerk. (Applause.)
O. G. Vickerson of the Waiters' Union
seconded the nomination of Mr. Fredrick
and the latter was nominated by accla
mation. Fredrick waa invited to the
platform and spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Conven
tionât- deeply appreciate the honor you have
conferred upon me In nominating me for the
office of County Clerk. I have read your plat
form thoroughly and I indorse it from top to
bottom. I will do my utmost to be elected and
also to elect the whole ticket, and I guarantee
that no act of mine will ever place a stigma on
the Union Labor party. I thank you. (Great
applause.)

Their followers attended the Labor party
convention last night and boasted that
they were sure of indorsement In that
quarter. Several delegates, however, were
quite free in expressing the opinion that
nothing could weaken the Labor party
so much in the estimation of the people
as failure to make straightforward, inde
pendent nominations. '''it*:;':

Young Mlllis arrived from, New York
but two days ago. On the journey out he
managed to save about $14 and hoped this
amount would provide for . him until he
could secure employment. Last evening
he met the man who gave the name of
Malloy and the latter offered to secure
employment for him to-day. Malloy took
the boy to a lodging-house at 417 Bush
street and young Millis, weary from
walking about the streets all day, was
soon asleep. At midnight he awakened
and found his companion gone. Suspect-
Ing something wrong, he searched for his
money and found It also missing. With
out waiting to dress he rushed to the
street and shouted for help. With the
crowd came a policeman, who took the
boy in charge, and with Patrolman
Holmes started out to find Malloy. A
search of Barbary Coast was made, but
the culprit was not caught.
Frank R. Mlllis, a 16-year-old boy, was
robbed of a pittance of money which he
had saved while crossing the continent In
a Bush-street lodging-houso last night.
The theft was committed by a stranger,
who gave the name of Patrick Malloy and
who did his petty work under the pulse of
friendship for the lad. When young Millis
discovered the theft he rushed half naked
Into the street, screaming for police as
sistance and was nearly crazed over hla
loss. Officers Heinz and Holmes spent
several hours looking for the thief.

SUXTAN OF MOROCCO
NARROWLY ESCAPES DEATH
Hamlin was in Denver when he first
heard of the proceedings instituted by his
wife and hurriedly made preparations for
a visit to this city, where he knew he
would meet Miss Hite. He wants to
have his wife modify the charges In her
complaint and rectify certain other state*
ments made by her in Seattle and tele
graphed broadly over the country.
HIS MAI> INFATTJATTON.
In her complaint for divorce, filed a
week ago in Seattle, Miss Hite detailed
how she and Hamlin first met in Denver
In February, 1901, while she was playing
In "The Telephone Girl"; how he per
sistently followed her about the circuit
and finally enticed her into a marriage,
which she claimed was fraught with many
pleasant experiences at first, but suddenly
terminated In the way that many similar
matches have. She charged that Hamlin
had spent large sums of money upon her
for jewelry and fine dresses, but event
ually, after a wild time in this city, he
had pawned her jewels ar.d she had been
compelled to advance him money from
her own small earnings in order to send
him back to his family in Chicago. It
was also alleged by the young wife that
she was compelled to pay his bill at the
Palace and settle his obligations at the
hotel bar.
WAS LAVISH WITH MONEY.
Kllis E. Hamlin, son of one of Chicago's
prominent citizens, who married Miss
I lite after a two weeks' acquaintance,
arrived in town yesterday. lie immedi
ately began making Inquiries as to when
the younc actress was expected and
was finally gratified with the information
that she would be here Sunday Jafternoon.
Then is when the trouble is expected to
begin, for Hamlin says he will not waste
time or words in having an understand
ing with his wife as to just how far she
is to go with her accusations regarding
his conduct during their short honey
moon.
LITTLE does Miss Mabel Hite, who
impersonates the character of
Phrosia, the fema!e detective, in
"The Chaperons." realize v.-hat a
warm reception she will receive
when she arrives in this'city next Sunday
afternoon to fill an engagement at the
California Theater. An indignant hus
band; whose wrath, long pont up. has
reached the boiling point, is at the Cali
fornia Hotel, where he 'is impatiently
awaiting the coming of his young spouse
with a view to taking her to account for
certain statement's supposed to have re
cently emanated from her in connection
with a suit for divorce brought against

FANATICS MAKE ATTACK ON
PHILIPPINE CONSTABULARY
It was learned last evening that the
mother of the young actress is also in
the city awaiting the arrival of her
daughter. The mother traveled with her
daughter up to a few we^ks prior to Ma-"
bel's marriage in Denyer and was so
journing In New Orleans when the news
of the event reached her and the subse
quent announcement that her daughter
and husband had separated hastened the
mother's determination to Join the ac
tress. It is possible that the parent will
have something to say when Hamlin and
his wife meet here Sunday.
During our two weeks in this city Miss Hite
was enly too wining to spend my money.
While the funds lasted I was her adored one,
but the trouble began when the money sup
ply commenced to run low. I wired my father
In Chlcasu for more money, but he was dii
susted with my actions and refused to pay any
attention to my telegrams. The day finally
arrived for the departure of the company, and
this girl, who had so stripped me of every
thing that I had to borrow money to get out
of town, took all th<Â» things 1 had Elven he
and departed without so much as bidding me
good-by. I had served her purpose and nhe
considered the incident closed. That wag the
laet 1 ever heard of Mabel Hite until the other
day, when the Denver rapers published a dis
patch from Seattle to the effect that she Isaa
applied for a divorce In that city.
I am :>err*ctly willing; In fact, more than
willing, to b* relieved from such obnoxious
matrimonial ties. Nothing would please my
folks more than for me to be freed from this
entanglement, but I intend to have nomethiag
to say upon what sort of grounds this divorce
is applied for, and that is v.iiy I am here. 1
intend meeting my wife upen her arrival here
Sunday, but it will not be for any sort of a
reconciliation, I can assure you.
MONEY GONE, LOVE WANED.
I have suffered enough through my unfor
tunate infatuation for this woman. 1 saw

There wasn't a day that I didn't brine my

a sealskin coat to c diamond necklacp. I gave
htr-everythinp she asked fcr. While the menev

lines of his strong face showed the best
characteristics of fiis race and who, with
a capacity for causing endless trouble,

she had all the symptoms and they be

away to end her life. Mrs. Catherine
Page, her mother, 13 prostrated. 'Â¦
The San Jose Oratorio Society, of which
Miss Pago was a prominent member, met
to-night and adjourned out of rtspect to
the missing girl. This meeting had been
called by Miss Page, who was assistant
secretary "of the society. Milton Page, a
brother, returned to-night from Santa
Cruz, where he has been for the past two
days searching the beach and waters for
his sifter's body. Aside from the cloth
ing found on the rocks at Vue de l'Eau
no trace of Miss Page could be found.
These articles of clothing "he brought
home this evening-. It has been arranged
to have the shore about Vue de. l'Eau pa
trolled and everything will be done to
find the body.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 16.â The friends of
Miss Hertha Page, who while temporarily
Insane wandered away and la believed
to have drowned herself in the surf near
Santa Cruz, are convinced that the girl
Is dead. The finding of her body is now
awaited. There ia much sorrow over the
young woman's untimely death. She was
a general favorite in society and musi

SpsdaJ Dispatch to The Call.
One of the officials remonstrated yester
day with Mathews against trying to take
up the body. It was pointed out that it
would not be in a condition to admit of
identification at th!s date. He contended,
however, that the woman was so soaked
with whisky that her body would be
found In a perfect state of preservation.
When she came home she became ad
dicted to the use of whisky. She -and her
husband had separated. Before she died
she told the people among whom she lived
that she had two children, a little girl
of 9 years and a boy not over 2. This
age would not agree with, the age of the
child born In England six years before.
The husband first learned of these chil
dren yesterday In reading the transcript.
The woman came to a miserable death.
One night in May. 1S37. some one went
to her room and found her dead in her
bed. She had drunk herself to death.
Xothing is known of her real antece
dents or how prominent a man her
father, who objected to her marriage
with Mathews. may have been.
Mathews found In the papers the Infor
mation that she left two children, of
which hÂ« knew nothing. The woman
came here a good many years ago as a
bride. She said that she and her hus
band had run away to be married to
avoid the Interference of her English
relatives. They had both lived In Eng
land. When they bad lived here awhile
she decided to go back to England so
that her child might be born among
friends and on English soil. She bore
the child there, but came back to Amer
ica, without It. That was six years be
fore she died.

FOWLER'S ENTHUSIASM
BALFOUR'S pamphlet defining his attitude
toward the tariff question in Great Britain
contributes to the discussion a bright and il
luminating phrase. After pointing out that the free
trade policy leaves the British market open to the
foreigner, and the British Government powerless to
obtain trade concessions in foreign markets, he says:
"The only alternative is to do to foreign countries
what they always do to each other, and instead of ap
pealing to economic theories in which they wholly
disbelieve to use fiscal inducements which they thor
oughly understand."
In that sentence Balfour sums up the substance
of his tariff policy. It is not the attitude of a true
protectionist, for as yet Balfour has not fully learned
the lesson that has been taught by experience, nor
has he grasped the fundamental principle that under
lies the issue between free trade and protection. He
looks at thr issue now confronting Great Britain
strictly from the standpoint of expediency. He as
serts that he is in principle and in doctrine a free
trader, and that he advocates the establishment of
protective duties on imports to Great Britain solely
that he may use them as a means of bartering and
trading in the arrangement of treaties that will pro
cure favors for British goods in foreign markets.
. The position thus taken differs materially from that
of Chamberlain, but not sufficiently to prevent the
two from working together against the ultra free
traders who will oppose any alteration in the estab
lished policy of the kingdom. Of course when the
fight is won by the protectionists and tiie time comes
for determining the schedules of the new tariff there
will arise a conflict between the two. Chamberlain
desires a customs duty on foodstuffs and other goods
of the kind produced in the colonies in order that he
may grant preferential trade within the empire, and
thet would imply a policy quite different from that
outlined by Balfour. The arrangement of schedules
and the preparation of a definite bill on the subject,
however, arc as yet far off. For a time at least the
two leaders can act as allies, making a combined at
tack upon the free traders who are the common foe
of both.
The fight promises to be the biggest political
campaign of the time in the domestic politics of any
country. In a measure it is "world politics," and the
contest will be watched with interest both in the
United States and in Continental Europe, for the
trade ol all nations is concerned in the outcome. In
some respects the undertaking of the Ministry to
bring abcur a change in the fiscal policy of the king
dom appears like a forlorn hope, for the British
public is conservative, and it is not going to be
rjsy to convince men who have been brought up to
believe in free trade as an article of faith that they
have been wrong all the time and that protection,
which they have derided as a relic of barbarism, is
after s-.II the most enlightened of fiscal policies. Still
the forces that are supporting the new movement are
strong. The resistless logic of facts is on the side of
the Ministry, and, furthermore, *a strong body of
manufacturers and others who have learned the les
son taught by facts will enter actively into the con
test and prove powerful allies.
The half-way position taken by Balfour in ' his
pamphlet, while weak from the standpoint of logic, will
doubtless be much more persuasive to the British
public than a more radical and advanced position
would be. He will not ask the voters to make the
whole distance from Cobdenism to protection at one
journey: He appeals to them first as a free trader
asking for permission to propagate free trade through
reciprocity treaties. He says to them: "It cannot
be right for a country with free trade ideals to enter
into competition with protectionist rivals, self de
prived of the only instrument whereby their policy
can conceivably be modified. The most essential
object of our national efforts should be to. get rid
of the bonds with which we have gratuitously en
tangled ourselves."
Presented, in that way the policy of protection will
not be so startling .to conservatism, and accordingly
:t is by no means certain that when the issue comes
before the people the free traders will obtain- a
triumph.
A scientist of Chicago claims that he has discov
ered a food which will make the men of the future
physical giants. He has probably reached a resigned
opinion that it is an idle quest to attempt any im
provement on the brains of the present generation. "
CONGRESSMAN FOWLER, chairman of the
House Committee on Banking and Currency
in the last Congress, has recently stated at
Chicago a conviction that the whole scheme of cur
rency reform, of which he is an earnest advocate, will
be provided for during the coming session. He has
prepared a bill which he will introduce at the extra
session, and he is quoted as saying that if the Senate
Finance Committee fails to report a good bill the
House will take up the issue and make a strenuous
fight for the desired reform.
When the strength of the opposition to any kind
of currency legislation this winter is taken into con
sideration the. statement of Mr. Fowler will appear
to be that of air enthusiast rather than of a care
fully calculating parliamentarian who counts the
votes in the House before he ventures to prophesy.
That estimate of the Congressman will be strength
ened when the radical nature of his programme is
understood. He gave an outline of>it in the very
statement in which he announced an assurance that
the bill would pass, and it appears that he expects
not only the adoption of legislation providing for
an elastic currency, but also for the retirement of
greenbacks and the substitution of a currency based
upon assets.
As outlined by himself the coming Fowler bill will
include three salient features. First, the re
tirement of greenbacks or their impounding in
the banks by a requirement that banks be
compelled to hold 40 per cent of their cash
reserves in greenbacks; second, a provision that
all public money be deposited in banks at 2 per cent
interest, being secured by a first lien on bank assets;
third, a provision that national banks be. permitted to
emit an asset or credit currency by depositing in the
United States treasury gold coin or Government
bonds equal to 5 per cent of the amount emitted.
To any One who has followed the discussion of this
subject during the past summer it is clear that no
such measure has any chance of enactment at the
coming session. A fight made for such a sweeping
measure would have no other effect than that of
rendering it difficult to pass even a moderate meas
ure designed with the; sole object of providing for
elasticity. In that way the enthusiasm of Mr. Fowler
is likely to prevent the very legislation in which he
is interested and for which he is so zealous. * .
The exact nature of the situation has been well ex
pressed by Senator Beveridge in an address before
the convention of Indiana bankers. In the course of
that address he said: "The coming session of Con

WHILE the impatient and irresponsible
zealots of the world are clamoring for the
nations of Europe to enter at once upon the
task of driving the Turk out of Macedonia, the Gov
ernments of the nations are pondering painfully how
they can best attend to their own troubles. They
have little time to think of the Balkans and no* im
mediate help to give. Not a nation in Europe is at
this time prepared to undertake the bearing \>i any
burden but its own. Britain, France, Germany and
Russia have each a home problem to worry over, while
Austria, whose relations to the Balkans are closer
than those of any other power, is well nigh distracted
by the seriousness of her domestic dissensions.
For years past the discordant elements of the Aus
trian empire have been on the verge of flying at one
another with fire and sword as fiercely as the Chris
tians and Moslems are now doing in Macedonia.
Fortunately the Government at Vienna is not so weak
as that at Constantinople. It has strength enough
to keep the peace and authority enough to command
respect. That authority, however, rests largely in the
personal character of the venerable Emperor. When
he is gone it is quite possible there may be a period
of turmoil that will render the Austrian problem as
perplexing to diplomatists as that of the Ottoman.
The evils of the empire are many and complicated.
At one time the strife between the Germans and the
Slavs appears to be the danger point, but almost
immediately another conflict appears that dwarfs the
former. At present the conflict between Hungary and
Austria looms largest on the horizon, and is unques
tionably threatening. Recent dispatches announced
that the aged Emperor is so much perturbed by the
strife around him that he once threatened to abdicate
and turn the task of government over to younger and
more vigorous hands. Almost at the same time an
other dispatch announced the appearance in Hun
gary of a movement to declare the Hungarian throne
vacant and to call for the election of a sovereign sep
arate and distinct from him who reigns over Austria.
With so much turmoil at home it is not easy to see
how the Austrian statesmen could act effectively in
Turkey. The German provinces of the empire would
not like to see a large addition made to the Slavonic
elements of the population by the incorporation in
the empire of any of the Balkan states. On the
other hand, neither the Slavonic nor the Hungarian
elements would like Austria to permit Russia to in
crease her power in that part of the world. Other
nations recognizing the danger of the situation are
careful not to venture upon any action that would
precipitate the long impending outbreak among
Maygars, Slavs, Czechs and Germans. Austria's
troubles, therefore, are a part and parcel of the Turk
ish problem. The uneasiness at Vienna helps to ex
plain the seeming indifference of the Governments
at Berlin, St. Petersburg, London and Paris.

Whatever may be said of the criminality of officers
of the Federal Government who substitute aged and
decrepit Chinese for young coolies, doomed to de

least one satisfaction. -The substitution does not
rob us of the fruits of the slow, tedious and uncertain
process by which Uncle Sam is ridding us of undesir
able Mongolians.

At a tea given by the Lambda Theta
Phi sorority in Berkeley yesterday the
engagement Qf William Theodore Watson
Jr. of San Francisco to Miss Florence
Reeve of Berkeley .was announced. Miss
Reeve Is the daughter of Mrs. F. Reeve.
Watson was a member of the class of
1904 at the University of California and
a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsllon
fraternity. He is the son of William The
odore "Watson, president of the Pacific
Refining and Roofing Company of this
city. He is now engaged in business in
this city. The young couple will be mar
ried within a year.

The Forum Club entertained its mem
bers and guests yesterday at their club
rooms by a reading from "The Simple
L.ife" by the Swiss clergyman, Charles
Watson. Mrs. S. E. Knowles gave the
chosen chapters bearing upon false stand,
ards of living with a fine understanding
of the motives underlying that remark
able book. Certainly from these rendi
tions the deduction Is easily made that
"he who chases after pleasure will never
catch up with her."
Miss Kate Whittaker followed Mrs.
Knowles' reading with an interesting lit
tle talk upon the Industrial work being
carried on in our public schools, espe
cially dwelling upon the cookery depart
ment, of which she Is supervisor. She
made clear to the ladies that the muf
fins made by her â¢ girls could really be
eaten â and without evil results.
Miss Langworthy rendered a piano solo
with fine technique, and Mrs. Biokell
closed the programme with a clever pa
per upon tue negro in his political and
social relation.
The informal tea that follows these in
tellectual afternoons affords much pleas
ant visiting.
The announcement of the engagement of
Miss Berate Drown to Samuel Boardma*
was the choicest bit of news enjoyed by
Boclety for many weeks. There Is no
social news so delectable as an engage
ment and none so wholly deliehtf ul as
a betrothal that has long been anticipated
and approved of. Surely the prospective
groom Is deserving of the warmest con
gratulation at havine won the love of
such a charming girl and the men who
know him say the bride is equally for
tunate in giving into Mr. Boardman's
keeping- her future happiness. Since her
debut Miss Drown has contributed gen
erously to the social pleasures of her set,
but she has nevertheless found much
time to alleviate the sorrows and suffer
ings of the unfortunate little ones who
are seeking relief -in the Children's Hos
pital, where her voice and her smile were
awaited eagerly by those who were her
special care.
With this self-appointed duty, her na
tively beautiful character .has grown and
broadened and its. influence is reflected
in her fine personality. With a ready
smile and a fine appreciation of humor,
she is the type of womanâ the womanly
womanâ who is essentially fitted to be
man's companion.
Miss Drown Is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. A. W. Drown, and has entertained
charmingly at her home on Jackson
street. It was at an Informal tea Wed
nesday that the betrothal was announced.
The wedding day ha3 not yet been deter
mined upon, but it will probably occur
before the Christmas holidays, a favorite
time for weddincs.

recommend to Congress that extensive Govern

preserve the industry by regulations is not
adequate. The commission has concluded thai
if the hatcheries -are established the supply
will meet the demand, and the only regula
tions necessary will bÂ« those governing thÂ«!

In addition to the study of salmon, the mem
bers of the party spent considerable time in
collecting aquatic animals â particular attention
being paid to deep-sea dredging. The results
were very satisfactory.
The three-months' trip was most pleasant
and profitable, the weather being delightful
during the entire time. We visited every
salmon cannery and saltery in Eastern Kadlak

of the expedition. Shuyak Island and ChlKuck

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 16.â
Dr. Barton W. Evermann, chief Ichthy

bert of tho Stanford zoological department
have returned fronr a three months' so
journ in the Alaskan waters, where they
have been investigating the salmon ques
tion on behalf of the Governxntent. Pres
ident Jordan was In charge of the expe
dition until July 25, when he returned to
California from Skagway and left the
work to the supervision of Dr. Ever
mann. The party went north on the Al
batross, the Fish Commission steamer.
Among the other members of the party
were Captain Swift of the Albatross, J.
N. Wlsner, superintendent of the (gov
ernment fish . hatcheries in Washington
and Oregon: 'A. B. Alexander, in charge
of statistics and methods; Cloudsby Rut

ernment naturalist on the Albatross: Dr.
Harold Heath of' the Stanford zoology de
partment; F. M. Chamberlain of the Fish
Commission, and Harold Bi Jordan. 'W.
son of President Jordan and- Deputy Fish
Commissioner.
Dr. Evermann will leave for Washing
ton, D. C, at once to.prepare a report on
the work done and observations made by
the "imrty. When seen this morning he
said:
last June.
After the Supervisors have adopted the
reduced rate In conjunction with the State
rate It Is planned that some taxpayer will
mandamus the Auditor to carry out th*
tax rate of $1,076 on tho assessment books
and have the Supreme Court decide the
disputed point. Lane and Cobb will havo
another conference to arrange the details
of the legal proceedings proposed to bn
instituted.
* City Attorney Lane was in consultation
yesterday with W. H. Cobb. Auditor
Baehr's legal adviser, for the purpose cf
taklns some . steps to have the Supreme
Court pass upon the point whether tho
raise in the assessment valuation of San
Francisco made by the State Board of
Equalization applies to the city ami
county tax rate. I>ane and Cobb agreed
that the practical solution of the proposi
tion would be for the Board of Supervis
ors to adopt next Mouday a tax rate
which will raise only the amount required
by the budget on the increased valuation
as returned by the Board of Equaliza
tion. This rate would be S2.72 cents in
stead of 11.076, as fixed by the Supervisors
THE country deplores the increase in lynching
and the readiness with which communities con
done the offense. If they would not also as read
ily condone the miscarriage of justice as administered
by juries -perhaps there would be less occasion for
lynching. The President and members of the Su
preme Court have called attention to the delay in ad
ministering the criminal law as one cause of mob vio
lence. This is no doubt true.- The many ways of
procuring the law's delay, taken advantage of by (
smart lawyers, frequently result in the escape of red
handed criminals, or in unjustly diluting their punish
ment and making the law a farce.
But all the blame cannot be put upon the lawyers,
and the Judges. Juries are as frequently culpable,
and by - rendering fantastic verdicts perhaps more
often violate the strict principles of justice than any
other part of its administration.
Oakland has been rather celebrated for freaks in
her judicial administration. One of her Justices once
filed an information againstÂ»himself for being drunk,
arraigned himself before himself, pleaded guilty'to
himself, and fined himself and solemnly paid the fine
to himself. Another judicial officer, being called
upon to pass sentence on a very contemptible
scoundrel who was convicted of bigamy, committed
under circumstances of extreme turpitude, took oc
casion to compliment the wretched sneak upon his
good character. Still more recently an Oakland
Police Justice has sentenced a non-union lineman
to fine and imprisonment for defending his life when
attacked by a mob of murderous strikers. Now a
jury has joined the procession. The negro VValkirez
has been tried and convicted of murder in the first
degree, but the jury gave him life imprisonment in
stead of the rope.
The murder was peculiarly atrocious. The victim
was an old woman who had considerable money, the
fruit of hard work and small savings. The mur
derer deliberately planned to kill her and steal her
money. He debated various ways in which to effect
this, and finally murdered her in a very brutal fashion
and buried the body in her own cellar, robbed the
house and fled. It was an awful crime, deliberately
committed, with a sordid motive. It was committed
in order that a debauched and dissolute wretch, too
lazy to work and willing to live by stealing what
others earned, might possess himself of the hard
earned dollars of a helpless oid woman whose in
dustry and foresight had made some provision against
the weakness of old age. The murderer was enjoy
ing her hospitality when he killed her. He had, as
part of his plan, wormed his way into her pity and
confidence, so that he often enjoyed the shelter of
her roof. Under these circumstances' he struck her
down without pity for her age or gratitude for her
bounty.
As long as hanging is the legal punishment for
murder, unless a jury will" otherwise, such a murder
deserves punishment by the rope. But a jury saved
this cowardly wretch's neck to impose his support
upon the taxpayers of California during a life sen
tence. It is a gross miscarriage of justice and an
outrage upon the people of the State. It is more
than that. The jury that rendered the verdict put
courage into the heart of every criminal in the
State; it made crime safer and life and property
less safe. It not only increased the burdens of the
taxpayers by the amount of this murderer's support
during his life sentence, but it increased the outlay
of public money that is necessary to police our
cities, hunt criminals in the country and run to jus
tice,the human hounds that prey upon society.
Against such verdicts the people have a right to be
heard, and we only voice the public judgment in
holding such a jury up to reprehension and con
tempt.

The significance of the statements of the Senator
is increased by the fact that he. has been recently in
conference with the President and with some , of
the leading financiers of the Senate and the House.
It may be accepted, therefore, that either Mr. Fowler

DANDRUFF CAUSED BY A GERM.
A New Discovery That Kills the
Germ and Prevents Baldness.
Pretty nearly all the hair preparations
for dandruff have some merit in allaying
itching of the scalp, and in being a
fairly good dressing for the hair but
there is Only one that recognizes what
causes dandruff, falling hair and bald-
ness, and that destroys the cause, a little
germâ and that Is Newbro's Herpicide.
This germ eats its way into the scalp,
it digs up the scalp Into little white
scales. Unless it is destroyed there's no
permanent stopping of falling hair and
cure of dandruff and baldness. Newbro's
Herpicide kills the germ. "Destroy the

Special Dispatch to The Call
TOPEKA, Kans.. Sept. 16.âTempera
tures in Kansas are from five to twelve
degrees lower than last night and a
heavy frost on the corn in the northern,
eastern and central portions of the State
is practically a certainty. From Concor
dia, Abilene. Salina, Phlllipsburg and
Newton comes the report that the tem
perature Is very low and another frost
is expected. The frost last night dam
aged corn in the northwest and with more
to-night the crop will receive a great set
back. In eastern and central Kansas the
farmers do not expect the corn to be ru
ined by to-nighfs frost, but it will make
the yield of an Inferior quality. Ten more
days of sunshine would have insured -a
good crop. In Salina the temperature is
only four degrees above freezing.

Erred in Giving Chatham Ma
jority of Three.
REDWOOD CITY, Sept. 16.â R. S.
Chatham, Republican, will probably be
declared elected Sheriff of San Mateo
County over J. H. Mansfield. Democrat,
by a majority of one vote. Mansfield was
given the certificate of election by the
Board of Supervisors upon the canvass
of the returns of the election officers,
these returns showing that he had re
ceived sixty-three more votes than Chat
ham.
The defeated candidate contested the
election ard upon a recount of the votes
by the court was plven a majority of
three votes. Judge Murarky presided at
the trial. He Is now of the opinion that
he erred with respect to two of these bal
lots and has directed the attorneys to ex
amine the record Tor the evidence con
cerning them. Should he finally hold that
these ballots were illegal Chatham will
still have a majority of one. A final de
cision will probably be rendered in a few
days. Should Mansfield be declared de
feated he will appeal to the Supreme
Court.

The corn market on the Board of Trade
to-day jumped l&i cents to' 1% cents on
frost news. At this there was a big and
excited trade, but many shorts were
eliminated yesterday, and this, with the
fact that the market has not yet reached
crop-scare proportions, kept prices from
"going through the roof," as some
thought they would. The close was 1^4
cents to 1% cents over yesterday's close.
"Up to date no great Oamage has been
done in the heart of the corn belt," said
Forecaster Walz to-day, "but it seema
certain that Illinois will have frost to
night, as will Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and
Indiana, for the cold wave is extending
east and south."
A scrutiny of the weather map to-day
told the tale of Jack Frost's work last
night. The coldest point was Huron,* S.
D.. where the mercury sagged to 24. At
Yankton the temperature was 32. Dodge
City, Kans., shivered while the thermom
eter registered 42, but It was only 36 at
Conccrdia. which was the lowest point in
the Sunflower State. At Omaha it was
36; r.t Sioux City. Iowa, it was 34, and
this is close to the heart of the corn
country.
With this cold wave reaching east and
couth, weather officials Fay, it looks dark
for the corn crop, for corn is late and re
quires in many sections another week of
warm weather to ripen.
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and In
diana will be touched by frost to-night,
according to the Weather Bureau. This
means that the very heart of the corn belt
is threatened. Heretofore warm, cloudy
weather has given the corn In this section
the time needed to ripen. l5ut much of it
Is still in a tender condition, and a sharp
frost to-night, it is admitted, would mean
tremendous loss.
CHICAGO. Sept. 16.â Killing frosts vis
ited the western portion of the corn belt
last night, doing much damage to crops,
and the signal service office predicts that
to-night the cold wave will reach east and
south.
Judge Wallace further held that the
trust sought to be create J Is void for two
reasons. First, it cj>pt.'ars to be a trust
lor charitable purposes and the will was
made within le*s than thirty days from
"vhe time of Jacobs' death. Second, it was
a truFt to convey real property and thore
fore void and illegal uinier decisions of
i he Supreme Court of California In t~e
< ase of Senator James G. Fair. The result
will be that the property will go to the
residuary legatees and their assign?.
It will be sees that the ruling of Judge
Wallace is a very important one. as there
itre about 35.000 acres of land involved In
the matter. The sixteenth clause was
â¢ itber a trust and void or else the prop
erty went absolutely to Albert Myer and
Fusxnan Mitchell, in which event they
could have disregarded the request to dis
tribute it to students and could have held
it themselves, and this d!d not appear to
have been the intention ol the deceased.
VISALIA, Sept. 16.â In the Superior
Court of Tulare County Judge W. B.
Wallace held that clause 16 of Elias Ja
cobs' will created a trust. Although it
" as stated in the will that the property
-liould go to Albert Meyer and Susman
Mitchell absolutely and free from any
trust, yet deceased expressed in the will
liia confidence that they would carry out
liis plan for disposing uf said land in
twenty-acre tracts to deserving graduates
of various educational Institutions.

of the team and got In wrong, otherwise
he might have gone the limit. The first
man who faced him, Casey, was given, a
chance on a bad error by Irwln. Then
Hildebrand bunted the bail and O'Brien
failed to pick it up In time to stop . the
runner. He then filled the sacks by Is
suing a pass to McLa.ugh.Iin.
Eagan hit to Raymond and he also
erred by throwing the ball away at the
plate and allowing Casey to score. Town
send responded with a punch to left field
and two more arrived. As the home field,
era were busy putting Sheehan out at
the first station Eagan made the trip,
giving* the Senators four to start with, a
safe little lead.
After that inning the young slabster
seemed to forget that his business was to
mystify the Senators' His backers sup
ported him well after the first inning, but
he never fooled the Senators so badly that
they could not make a run or two when
ever they wished. Twelve runs and four
teen hits tell the story of how Mr. O'Brien
was received.
Teeley Raymond saved the home team
from getting the white coating In ' the
sixth spasm. Delmas had led off with a
double and then the youngster swung on
one that looked good to him and sent it on
a speed trip over the right field fence.
Fitzgerald had the home sluggers un
der the spell of something in eve'ry round
but the ' sixth. He was tossing >the ball
oveo^the rubber until it seemed as big as
a balloon, but somehow they could never
do a thing to him. The score:- ' : f'f. "

this afternoon for two hours and a half. Los

Angeles 0, Oakland 5^> â¢<
The game had been close all through. In
the last half of the ninth Dillon, who was on
the bench, sent Ross In to bat for Hurlburt.
The little left fielder drove a scorcher Into right
field for three bags. The decision at third was
close. While Lohman and other players ar-
R-ued with O'Connell Roes stood on the base.
Caster got the ball In the shuffle and. when
opportunity offered, gave Ross a push that
eent him off the base and then put the ball on
him. Hurlburt, who was coaching at third,
explained to O'Connell that Ross had been de
liberately pushed off the base.
In the melee about the umpire Baxter and
Hurlburt came to blows. Baxter made a dive
for Hurlburt's legs to throw him, but the big
catclfer got the "Moose's" head in chancery and
proceeded to uppercut him right merrily. It
Â¦required a half-dozen players to separate the
combatants. After things had quieted down
Newton, who took HaU'e place at bat. walked
and Hoy drove a bounder to Mosklman. The
r>octor threw wildly to the plate and Rosa
scored, tying the score. The line-up was
changed in the tenth. Hall and Hurlburt went
to the bench, Newton to the box. Spies be
hind the bat and Cravath on first. For three
Innings there was some brilliant ball. In the
twelfth Spies hit for two bases, went to third
on Cravath's out and scored on Corbett's
grounder through Devereaux. Score:

Sept. 16.â Tbe field which took part in
the Willow stakes at Gravesend to-day
was hish class. The conditions required
such excellent youngsters as Turquoise
Blue and Ocean Tide to concede from
twenty to twenty-live pounds to Audience
and Dimple, both of which had run well,
especially the Jast named. Marjoram's
post position was number one. and, with
Hullxnan up, it was conceded that this
would enhance her chances very decid
edly. Hardly had the barrier been re
leastd v.hcn it was plain that Marjoram
had all her speed and. with Buliman sit
ting well up, the flying filly opened up a
gap of daylight which was hailed with
delight by her backers. At no time did
It appear as if she were stopping and the
daughter of Hastings won very easily.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES
IN AN3STJAL COMPETITION
Millett was an easy-going, good-natured
amateur until he wer.t to Honolulu a
year ago. Up to that time It was difficult
to get him to train. When his lot was
cast among strangers he settled down to
work and was always in good condition.
He won several of his fights ao quickly
that the spectators raised a cry of "f-jul."
Ruhlin weighs about 190 pounds. Mil
lett weighed 1S2 pounds yesterday. Befora
the match was made Greggalns tried out
Millett. He first knocked out P. Marino
and then stopped a sailor in half a round
who thought he was a second Sharkey.
The match was made yesterday by
Alex Greggains of the San Francisco
Athletic Club. The men are to meet in
this city on October 23. Ruhlin, whoso
latest ring engagement Â«vas a six-round
bout with Kid Carter in Philadelphia, will
come West at once.
The man frcm Ohio whom Jeffries made
quit In five rounda on November 15, 1301,
in this city, has agreed to tight Joe Mil
lett, who Is just blossoming out as a pro
fessional.

at one time to wear the heavy-weight box-

* Is Not a SKin Disease.
Most people hare an idea that rheumatism is contracted like a cold, that the
damp, chilly air penetrates the muscles and joints and causes the terrible aches
and pains, or that it is something like a 6kin disease to be rubbed away with lini-
ment or drawn out with plasters; but Rhuematism originates in the blood and is
caused by Urea, or Uric Add, an irritating,_ corroding poison that settles in mus-
cles, joints and nerves, producing inflammation and soreness and the sharp, cutting
pains peculiar to this distressing disease. . â¢ * ;j

Hon. Spencer' Lyttelton of London, a
nephew of the late William -E. Gladstone,
whose secretary he was for twenty-three
years, with the exception of a short
period when he was assistant secretary to
Earl Granville, arrived from England yes
terday, en route to New Zealand, and is
registered at the Palace Hotel. The gen
tleman passed through San Francisco
twenty years ago with Arthur Balfour,
the Dresent Premier of Great Britain,
and is therefore not unacquainted with the
country, and during an interivew last
evening he said he was greatly surprised
with the remarkable growth- of the west
ern section of the United States.
Mr. Lyttelton declined to discuss British
politics In any way. remarking that he
Is traveling now as a private citizen and
Is not deeply Interested In the political slt
uallon in his own country. Referring to
the late William E. Gladstone, be said
that the memoirs, on which John Morley
is at present at work, will soon be ready
for issuance, and he added:
"Mr. Morley's task has been a hard
one, a fact which can be readily appre
ciated when one considers that ho had to
review sixty years of the active political
Ufa of the dead "Premier and read over
sixty thousand letters."

which he held for so many years, served

A valuable bit of information Is given
on the quoted excess of imports over ex
ports, which has so often been held a
sign of British trade decline. The blue
book says that while the excess yearly
averages about $800,000,000, the income re
ceivable from foreign investments, calcu
lated at $312,500,000, added to the earnings
of the British merchant fleet engaged In
foreign trade, calculated at $450,000,000, "is
probably more than sufficient to account
for the average excess of Imports."
The proportion of the United Kingdom
exports, as between protected and unpro
tected countries, in the markets of the
world has been reversed since 1850. Then
it was 56 per cent to the protected coun
tries and 44 per cent to the others. In 1903
the proportion was 42 per cent to the pro
tected countries and 58 per cent to the
others.
LONDON, Sept. 16.â On the heels of Bal
four's academic expression of his persona!
views of the fiscal problem, contained In
the pamphlet on "Insular Free Trade, '
advance sheet3 of Â¦which were Issued last
night, came the long promised and much
demanded Government statistics dealing
with that subject. They were issued to
day by the Board of Trade in the shape
of a bi*f book of nearly 500 pages of be
wildering tables of figures showing . the
various aspects of British and foreign
trade and the industrial conditions. No
deductions were drawn, though the pub
lication teems with interesting notes upon
what are regarded as points of fact. The
references to foreign trade were chiefly
confined to France, Germany and the
United States.
One of the most Important phases dealt
with in the! blue book are imports and ex
ports. The tables show that exports from
the United Kingdom to the United States
declined from $143,000,000 in 1S90 to $97,500,
000 In 1902, while the Imports rose from
$385,000,000 to $635,000,000. The total exports
to all foreign countries declined In the
same period $30,000,000, though when the
colonies are included the decline amounts
to only $5,000,000.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 16.â A gang of
rradcrs at work on what will ultimately
be a broad driveway to the ocean, known
as Sunset boulevard, unearthed to-day
more than a peck cf coins. They were
using a plow and following it with a
fcraper, when the plow struck a pocket
IB the earth containing the coins. '
There was e rush by the score or more
Of men in the gang to get all of it they
could reach. Several fights resulted, but
within a minute all of the supposed rich
find had been gathered up, some cf the
men having their hats full of it. Henry
Klages, on whose land the men were
working, was attracted by the noise and
v.hcn shown some of the coins he dashed
the hopes of the men to the ground by
declaring all of them counterfeit. All
of the coins were then placed in a pile
end a clcse examination of them made.
There were several quarts of them in |1,
15 and 110 pieces. In size they were slight
ly smaller than the genuine, but this
Olfft-rence would be made up in the oper
ation of plating them with gold or silver,
and such was evidently the purpose of
the men who made them.
Klapes took possession of the find and
turned it over to the United States au
thorities. He has -owned the property
eleven years and about nine years ago
leased it to a party of Italians, who lived
there a year or more, when they were
caught in the act of making counterfeit
money and arrested. This was the noto
rious Trigaani pang, four members of
which were sentenced to San Quentin for
eight years. The sentwices were only re
cently completed and It is known that
members of the gang returned to this
part of the State.
During the past few months this city
has been the scene of operations of a
panp of counterfeiters and although the
secret service officials have been work
ing hard on the cases they have as yet
made no arrests. The bogus coins which
have been passed here, when compared
Â¦with those found to-day, were found to
be Identical. It is therefore believed
that the peck or more of counterfeit coins
unearthed to-day was but one of several
caches of the old Trigannl gang and that
some of the members of that gang or
other persons informed by them have re
turned to this part of the State and are
using the "money" made several years
'ago.

We are met here .to consider the all-Im

the best for themselves and their home. "Wn

most In his heart the welfare of Alameda. I
think that this gathering Is thoroughly repre
sentative cf Alameda; that it is conservative
and that It does not believe in running after
Don Quixote windmills, for many years in
this State the railroad has abused its power
and there has grown up a feeling antagonistic
to it That - feeling, however, should be
curbed. If we now have the power ; we should
use it rightly and not abuse It. I know that
the agitation and mixing of the situation has
caused some men doing business on Park
street to say and do things which in their se
rious moments they would not have done. The
railroad company has done things. at the West
End that were not conducive to the produc
tion of harmony. What we are seeking now
Is the greatest good to the greatest number.
We cannot swim to Ban Francisco. The South
ern Pacific has always done business with us
and Is prepared to continue. Now Ib our time
to do business with the company. We cannot
ro back to the days of oxcarts and rowboats.
There Is only. one transportation company that
we can do business with and that is the South
ern Pacific. <WMf

DISASTROUS RESULTS.
Resolved. That we, the citizens of Alameda.
In mass meeting; assembled, do hereby urge
the municipal Trustees to grant to the South
ern Pacific Company auch f ranch If eÂ» as will
insure a continuance of the ferry facilities
which we now enjoy and on Â¦ the beet terms
which the board is able to exact; and we urge
upon them the importance cf early action, as
â¢ very day's delay only adds to the doubt and
to the Injury of the town.
Resolved. That the citizens of Alameda re-
Iterate their faith In the members of the
municipal board, and urge them to a speedy
â¢settlement cf this matter, assuring them or
the support and of the defense. If needs be, of
the great majority of residents, taxpayers and
voters of the city in the legitimate uiscnargw
of their duty.
ALAMEDA, Sept 15.â Upward of
700 representative citizens crowd
ed into old Library Hall to-night
to hear the railroad franchise sit
uation discussed. It was the
largest and most important public gath
ering of residents since the railroad agi
tation began three months ago. Resolu
tions urging the City Trustees to grant to
the Southern Pacific Company on the best
terms such franchises as will insure a
continuance of the ferry and train service
which Alameda now enjoys and asserting
confidence In the municipal
were adopted. It Is eet forth in the pre
amble to the resolutions that Alameda
owes its present high rank as a resident
place to Its splendid double ferry system
connecting with San Francisco and that
the future of the city depends upon the
constant maintenance of these transporta
tion facilities; that Alameda must look to
the Southern Pacific Company to supply
these facilities and that an assurance
that such traveling conveniences will be
permanent Is the best guarantee that Ala
meda could obtain of progress and pros
perity. Here are the resolutions:
Other speakers were G. R. Renner,
George H. Mastick, A. P. Lorentzen, A.
G. Bell and B. K. Funke.
E. \V. Maslln facetiously suggested that
the Board of Trade be tendered a vote
of thanks for its incendiary meeting Fri
day night, which Maslin said brought out
true conservative and law abiding Ala
medans a3 nothing else would. Alex R.
Baum.G. H. Mastick and R. Brent Mitch
ell drafted the resolutions, which were
adopted.
Instrumental in arranging to-nlghfB
meeting were Dr. G. R. Reynolds. T. G.

R. Brent Mitchell said:
We have come 1 here not for the purpose ot
tarring or feathering the City Trustees or to
Indorse any sentiment that would lead to such
doings. We are here to evince our support
of them and ask them to give the franchises
to the Southern Pacific on the best possible
terms. Let us leave the disposition of the
franchises to the City Trustees.
who was one of the signers of the call
for the mass meeting:
An unfortunate accident prevents my attend
ing- your meeting this evening. I Â¦ am on
crutches and imagine I feel like our mts-
Kuided friends. "Scarcely a leg to stand on."
At this time and In this manner I am not
Inclined to give my views on the franchise,
but I do not want to lose this opportunity to
declare that I am positive that only a vÂ£ry
limited number of our citizens desire to In
dorse the sentiment expressed by our so-called
Board of Trade. '"Tar and feathers," "Hemp"
and "Branding" are words foreign to the com
munity and should -not be tolerated. I don't
consider It my privilege to advise or suggest
to our municipal board what they should or
should not do; but I do consider it an op
portunity at this critical time to assure them
that I have the same confidence In their In
tegrity and ability to guard our city's interest
that I had when I cast my vote for their
election. I believe they merit our support and
will not be Influenced by cowardly threats or
doubtful praise, â¢' and after they have given
this auestlan full consideration their matured
judgment will dictate a franchise fair and ac
ceptable to both city and railroads and end
this unfortunate and unnecessary wrangle
among ourselves, when we can be as one to
convince homescekers that Alameda has now,
as she always has had, the best transporta
tion facilities, the best schools, and is the best
governed and most healthful suburb of San
Francisco. Â¦ - . r;-p

About eight years ago. the alleged
widow says, she met Charles Hill at
Forty-mile Station. Alaska. Shortly aft
erward a civil contract of marriaga mada
them one. Mrs. Hill was the only woman
In that part of the Klondike at the time,
and was seeking gold like the men. One
day In '96 Mrs. Hill went boating. She
was going to take a matter of two days*
Jaunt on the river. She dropped her
scarf near the station, out, unmindful of
the loss, paddled on. "An Indian found the
scarf floating on the river and. with the
sagacity of his race, concluded that shÂ«
was drowned. So he told Hill about It
and Hill, accepting: the mute evidence of
his wife's death, departed for the States
to become the Charles Hill, or "Salem
Charles," of will contest fame.
Back of the charge on which Mrs. Hill
was arrested last night Is another woman.
Attorney Mos3 says that Mrs. Hill of
fered this woman $1000 to testify for her.
Again and again the woman refused the
importunities of the alleged Hill widow,
it is claimed, until finally her solicitations
for perjured testimony became so, obnox
ious that tho woman, whose name is with
held, told the District Attorney all
about It.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 16.â Another al
leged widow of Charles Hill, alias Salem
Charles, that mysterious old man who
died here about a year ago leaving $112,000
in a box In a security deposit company's
vaults, has come to grief.
"Mrs. Laura Hill," who came out of
Alaska not long ago proclaiming herself
to be the genuine widow of "Charles
Hill," was arrested to-night en a felony
charge and locked in the City Jail in de
fault of $2500 ball. The complaint against
Mrs. Hill Â¦was sworn to by Leon F. Moss,
attorney for the Salem Charles claimants,
and alleges an attempt to bribe a wit
ness.
Before the week is out there will be two
more felony charges for Mrs. Hill to an
swer. One will be for perjury, the other
for manufacturing bogns documents. Re
garding the perjury charge Mo3s said it
will arise from alleged misrepresentations
made by Mrs. Hill in the deposition which
she made to the District Attorney yester
day.

SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 16.â A fierce for
est fire Is reported raging near Whites
Hill, about six miles from San Rafael.
Latest reports say flames are threatening
to destroy valuable property on the- Mal
liass tract and if it spreads Is liable to de
stroy property on the North Shore Rail
road. Property owners have employes
fighting the progress of the conflagration
and this evening the railroad compaii'
brought fifty men from the northern sec
tion to look out for their Interests.
The flames are- extending along the
county road and have burned portions of
the fences. Constable Louis Hughes *nd
Thomas Day, a druggist of this city, had
a narrow escape from being seriously
burned while passing the nre-lnfested re
gion. Hughes and Day left early in the
afternoon for a ranch several miles north
of here. On their return they noticed the
smoke ahead, but thought It did not ex
tend to the county road and if so they
could pass easily. "When describing the
grade on this side of Whites Hill they
perceived the flames in front of them and
discovered they were hemmed in. The
flames were leaping out into the road.
Placing the buggy robe up as a shield,
they made a dash through the fire. When
Just In the fiercest part their team balked.
Hughes finally succeeded In getting tha

place of safety. The team was scorched,
but the two men were not badly burned.

MAYOR SCHMITZ SPEAKS.
At the Mechanics' Pavilion and at Sar
atoga Hall the reading c* the Declaration
of Independence of Mexico was accom
plished amid enthusiasm. At the former
A. tie la Torre Jr. performed the proud
office of reading the precious document in
Spanish, while at the latter the same duty
fell to St. Francisco Olave. The oration
in English was given to the Zaragoza
Club by Bert Schlesir.ger, and Senator E.
K. Taylor performed a eimilar office in
the presence cf the Junta Patriotica.
The attendance at both places was large
and the programmes were profuse with
martial music and songs of Mexico and
flags bcth of the United States and Mex
ico hung and waved side by side or were
held aloft as the "Stars and Stripes" and
the Mexican National Hymn were sung
in turn.
The Consul General paid official visits
both to the gathering of the Junta Patri
ctica at Saratoga Hall and the Zaragoza
Club, which celebrated at the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
With fervent sentiments of thankful
ness for Mexico's liberty and rousing
words in praise of deeds well done by pa
triots and especially glowing for Hidalgo,
and with expressions of loyalty to Diaz,
Rafael Zavas Enriquez, the Mexican Con
sul General in San Francisco, stirred the
sentiment of his compatriots resident In
this city last night.
The occasion was, of course, the cele
bration of the ninety-third anniversary
cf the independence of Mexico, the decla
ration of which v.-as first told to the pop
ulace at 11 o'clock on the night of Sep
tember 15, 1S10.
I. W. Hellman Jr.. speaking for his
father yesterday, said that he was not
aware that the former had any Interest
in the Xorthern California undertaking.
He, however, admitted that he had known
for some months that Captain Rosa was
planning a number of electric railways
north of San Francisco, with a steamer
connection on the bay, by which freight
can be landed in this city. He had heard
that Ross had in view as his bay terminal
a point of land near Vallejo Junction.
Several months ago, when the Hunt-
Ington-Hellman syndicate was warring
with the Southern Pacific Company in
Southern California over their respective
lines, Henry E. Huntington came to this
city and, calling on President Harriman
of the Southern Pacific Company, 5 In
formed that gentleman that if he per
sisted in interfering with the electric road
system in Southern California the Hunt
ington-Hellman syndicate would -Invade
Northern California with a similar sys
tem of roads and fight the Southern Pa
cific to a finish. N
Later it was reported that Harriman
and Huntington had patched up their dif
ferences in the south, but there are many
who are inclined to believe that If a
treaty of peace was really signed Hunt
ington did not Include in it a promise to
stay out of Northern California If condi
tions warranted the introduction of elec
tric roads for freight traffic there. "With
the construction of a few hundred miles
Of electric road Huntington could soon
make connection with the lines In which
he has already secured an Interest and
possibly controls, and in a very short
time effect a gigantic system that -would
prove a most formidable competitor to
the steam roads through the valley sec
tions of the State.
EVIDENTLY NO TRUCE.
Although Captain Ross* plans and his
movements for several months h:ive been
known to a number of men In this city
and the interior he has discreetly kept
as a secret one of the most important
things in connection with his scheme,
namely, who is behind it in a financial
way. It is well know;* in Los Angeles
that Captain Ross enjoys to a great ex
tent the confidence of Henry E. Hunting
ton, and this, together with the fact that
the latter gentleman already owns or
holds large interests in a number of elec
tric roads in Northern California and is
deeply interested in the moro modern
method of transportation, as has been
evidenced by the work he has done In
the south, gives rise to the suspicion that
the multi-millionaire is backing Ross' en
terprise. Such being the case it is nat
ural that those who have been watching
Ross would imagine that Banker Hell
man Is also in the scheme.
In many cases the proposed lines have
been made to parallel the present steam
roads, a fact which has suggested that
the plan Is to operate if necessary
through the very same territory from
which the Southern" Pacific Company is
deriving the major part of it3 local reve
nue. Captain Ross has spent many weeks
in San Francisco during the. past year,
devbtingr his attention to the "work of his
surveyors and particularly to the men
working between Sacramento and Stock
ton and this city. His plans are said to
include a scheme for a bay terminus
somewhere near Vallejo Junction, to
which pqlnt freight destined for this city
can be transferred to boats and brought
here at a more reasonable rate than the
producers can expect to obtain from the
steam roads.
A gigantic project, involving the Invest
ment of many millions of dollars, promis
ing much In the way of development of
the varied interests of Central and North
ern California and in which it Is strongly
suspected that Henry E. Huntlngton and
his railroad associates have a hand, is
now under way and may be made public
at any time. ',Â»"
It is a plan to connect the numerous
cities and towns north of San Francisco
by electric railroads, covering the upper
portion of. the State in a manner s^nilar
to that in Southern California, and ope
rating these roads in connection with a
steamer line on the bay by which passen
ger and freight traffic can be extended to
this city.
It has been learned that several survey
ing parties have been working at different
"points above San Francisco for a number
of months under the direction of Captain
Ross and his son of Los -Angeles. These
parties have carefully surveyed the Sac
ramento Valley and portions of the fer
tile sections of the State, traversed by the
California Northwestern road.

Superintendent Babcock said that the
damage done would not be as great as
was first supposed. New instruments
have been installed and the system is
again In working order.
The ir.oet likely 'manner in which the van
dal* of last night succeeded in switching our
current was by means of formlr.g an attach
ment between our wires and some others out-
Fide of the system. A wire might easily hare
been attached to the trolley wire or the rail
road circuit and the other end dropped over
our lines, thus switching the current and ruln
lnr our instrument*. The vandals after leav-
Ing the current en as long as they wanted
had only to remove the connecting wire and
thÂ» equilibrium of the fire alarm circuit would
again be restored.
Superintendent Babcock, with the aid of
the police, is- now conducting a rigorous
investigation and hopes soon to have the
guilty parties under arrest. If caught
the miscreants will probably be severely
dealt with, as the crippling oÂ«: the system
rendered useless every f.re alarm cignal
box in the city east of Webster street and
loft the city in great danger from confla-
Superintendent' Babcock, in discussing
ihe matter to-day, said:
That the crippling of the Â«yEtprn yesterday
Â¦aenuns was xto* work cf vandals I am fully
â¢ onvmred. because if it had been an accident
th*re would have l*Â»vn a rrpttition iast night.
f we were foul of an arc electrical circuit
Â¦when the lights were started last night we
would fcave been in trouble CRa:n.
I have gone over the entire East Oakland
pyMem three times and have been unable to
nod a tingle thing wronc with wire?. Two
bores were burned completely out and cni
1 a!f of the instruments -rendered useless.
TCverythixp: <"art of Webster street was thrown
out of order, leaving that portion of the city
Â«ntlre!y without fire or police protection.
Had there been anything wrong with out
v.ires the search we have made would have
revealed it Then, again, to show that It was
the work of \anials. we have the fact that
to-day agoin the pystem is in perfect order
with the exception of the damage dor.e to the
instrument? when the current was switched.
The fire alarm wires are the upper wires on
the poles alcr.sr the putter and It would be im
possible for a broken arc or electric railroad
wire to fa'.l across them. Had our wires
l.roken and fallen across the others, the break
Â» ould have been found, and necessarily would
have hed to be repaired before the" system
could be rut in working 1 order again. â¢ Xo
breaks were found however.

The serious crippling of the tire alarm
system and police telephones in this city
yesterday morning: Â¦was not. as was at
first supposed, due to a cross with live
wires. From the investigation conducted
by Superintendent of Fire Alarm and Po

been proven conclusively to that official's
satisfaction to have been the work of
vandals.

The rate of reinsurance on the British tramp
steamship Laurel Branch was advanced, yes
terday to "0 â¢ per cent. She is now ' out 25
days from Coronel to Punta Arenas. This trip
should have taken about ten days. It Is-pos
sible that the bis freighter may have broken
down, but the general opinion seems to be
that Fhe has foundered. Under sail, how
ever, the Laurel Branch would prove a pretty
elow traveler, and In this the more sanguine
eve considerable hope. In eptte of the TO per
cent rate, however, there has been no heavy
speculation on the steamship's chances of ar
rival.

court yesterday to pass upon the sanity
of Mrs. Etta Fltzgibbons, who Is charged
with assault to murder. She has been
sent to the insane ward in the Central

under expert surveillance till Saturday,
when the case will be again called.
Mrs. Fltzgibbons was -living in. a lodg
ing-house at 873 Market street on May 3
and Joseph A. Gagen, a young boxmaker,
called upon her. He had not been talking
to her long when she accused him of at
tempting to choke her, and, procuring a
revolver, fired five shots at him, each
bullet taking effect. Gagen's ante
morten statement was taken, as it was
feared he could not recover: He denied
that he had attemtped to choke the
woman and said the shooting was done
without any provocation. He slowly re
covered.

THE steamship City of Sydney,
which arrived yesterday from
Panama, brought home Mate John
Nelson and five members of the
crew of the schooner Lena Swea
sey, which was wTecked last August off
JCrfvldad. The captain of the schooner
remained behind to attend to the dispo
sition of the wreck and cargo. The Swea
sey went to Navidad for a cargo of hard
wood logs and was loaded and ready for
sea when a heavy gale drove her ashore
and Jammed her hard and fast In the
breakers. Although all hands got ashore,
it was only after a hard struggle in the
boiling surf. The strongest went first and
those that followed were glad to avail
themselves of the aid of the vanguard, j
The schooner became a total wreck.
Those that accompanied Nelson wen/
Henry Gibson, C. Gabriel3on, J. Anderson,
Hans Knudsen and Sigura Berntsen.
The Sydney brought a full cargo and
passengers, including Her.ri Chretien and
wife. Mrs. Eva K. de Sabla. J. C. Duval,
Chris LHeterich and C. L. Larm.
ASTORIA, Or., Sept. 16.â The American
schooner Andy Mahoney, fears for the
safety of which were entertained at San
Francisco, reached port to-day from San
ta Rosalia with a partial cargo of sail.
The Mahoney was short of provisions,
but the Gaelic, from San Francisco, sup
plied her with some fresh meat, eggs,
etc., 'and she was amply supplied during
the remainder of the voyage. Last Sat
urday's gale was -encountered and the
jib stay was carried away, but no other
acclOnt occurred during the passage.
The failure of the Mahoney to arrive in
better time was due to the fouling of her
bottpm in the tropics. All the members
of the crew, as well as Captain Anderson,
his wife and two children, are in excel
lent health.
The great log raft was towed to sea
this morning for San Francisco. The
steamer Francis H. Leggett is taking the
monster boom down the coast. The raft
in 735 feet in length and contains almost
8,000,000 feet of telegraph pole's and piling.
The Leggett has a cargo of more than
1,000.000 feet of lumber.
Arrives at Seattle Minus Jibstay, but
With Crew Well and Cargo

Unless some action toward settling the
caaal cuestion is taken soon, however,
men in a position to judge say that revo
lution will once more stir the republic.
The strongest supporters of the Panama
â¢ anal are the young business men of the
ipthmus, and they are said to have a
following strong enough to warrant the
faith in their ability to bring Colombia
to terras by strength of arms.
The people of the isthmus, say the
steamship officers, have long nursed
grievances arainst the Colombian Gov
ernment. From the isthmus the republic
draws Its principal revenues, but for no
part of Colombia do the ruling powers
do less. Contact with the ouls'.de world
has Infected those Colombians located at
Colon and Panama with up-to-date ideas.
They realize, for instance, that the ua
healthfulr.ess of their cities Is due to lack
of drainage and Improper sanitary ar
rangements. They realize that the prev
alence of fever is a serious handicap.
They have learned the remedy, but all
appeals to the Government for appropria
tions have fallen on ears that heeded not.
Bven the funds to secure the cutting of
the brush in the immediate vicinity of
Panama were refused. In the completion
of the Panama canal the people of the
isthmus saw a. way to a better state of
affairs and when the Colombian Congress
refused to ratify the treaty the people
of Panama were aroused to indignation.
When the City of Sydney sailed secret
meetings were being held all over Panama
for the purpose of discussing- ways and
mea s 1 ir securing the independence of
the i'tfanr-us. The meetings were secret
for tfc reason that open expressions of
opinion are dangerous in that part of
the world where Government spies and
military prisons are flourishing: institu
tions.
According to the ofllcers of the
steamships Colon and City of Syd
ney, the people of Panama aro
ripe for secession froia Colombia,
and unless ihc CongTes* of the South
American republic takes some early and
satisfactory action in the matter of the
Panama canal nothing can prevent a
break for independence on the part of
the people of the isthmus. The Colon
arrived from Panama a week ago, but
her officers, crew and passengers were
detained at Ansel Island until Tuesday
evening. The City of Sydney arrived yes
terday and after a short detention in
quaractise was allowed to proceed to her
dock.
It is expected that the entire consign
ment of cable on the Burnside will be laid
and the vessel be back in this port for the
final link by October 15.
SEATTLE, Sept. 16.-The United States
cableship Burnside sailed for the north
last night to continue the work of laying
the cable from the head of Lynn canal, by
way of Sitka, the capital of Alaska, to this
city. She has a stretch of 600 miles . of
cable aboard, which was transferred from

The circular of Somers & Ca says of Hay:
"But 3600 tons of Hay have arrived during
the week, a decided lessening from the total of
the week before showing 5000 tons. This
would seem to indicate that the regular fall
rush was about over, although It Is reported
that a great quantity of Hay has been left In
Oakland, the tracks there being too full to
permit of same being marketed here Immedi
ately. The report comes In, however, that
many points are through shipping and that
the market will be on an entirely different
basis by the first oC October.
"Local conditions remain unchanged as far
as the demand v goes: Many of the larger con
sumers are now well filled up with their win?
ter*8 supply. The Hawaiian Islands continue
to take their regular quota and there Is some
little movement of Hay coastwise right along.
Conflicting reports come to us from Â¦ Oregon
and Washington. Â¦Â¦ for some say. their Hay
crops are abundant this : season, while others
write that they will have to come here for a
ceitain quantity of Hay. as they did last sea
son. Therefore, although we have no assurance
of any particular outside demand, yet there Is
the possibility of its springing up later on.
The Government etlll hesitates in awarding Its
Hay contracts, but it is generally believed
that the order will be placed in this market.
"Prices show no change, with choice Wheat
Hay and choice Alfalfa a bit scarce and with
Straw. In very plentiful supply."

CHICAGO, Sept. It}.â Speculative Interest
centered In the corn pit to-day, and tradtng
was active and excited. December closed with
a net gain of 1 Vifc l-%c. Wheat opened with
considerable activity on the sharp upturn in
corn, with December \iÂ£t%c to %Â«?%c higher,
at 82;4c to 83%c. . But the news from the
Northwest soon became more reassuring* with
foreign news rather tame, and these Influence*,
together with a sharp break In September at
Minneapolis, caused the strength to desert the
pit, and December relaxed to 82V4c..- Local
traders followed the action of brokers sup
posed to be acting for Armour, who sold wheat
generally. Trade was large, and the late mar
ket took on a batter tone on a firmer, tendency
In the late cables and a recovery In the North
west markets. December closed unchanged at
fe2^0%c.
Shorts In the corn pit made a concentrated
rush to cover at the opening, and the bidding
continued vigorously until the price had rralned
114 cent* on the closing quotations of last
night. But at the advance offerings from
holders with profits became so free that they
checked the upward movement, the selling be-
Ins led by the traders, who took advantage of
the slump yesterday and took on what proved
to be cheap corn. The late market snowed a
divided sentiment, but there was little short
netting. December closed, strong at 52V)iff%c.
a gain of Il491%c, after ranging between
&mÂ®%e and 52c.
The oats market was strong, with light of
ferings. â¢ December Closed %@%c higher, at

ribs.

reported advancing, but little business is being

present cost cannot compete with the British
Columbia products: the present steamer freight*

probability of their remaining so. But few
changes from coal to oil are now beinr made.

them ashore in Peterson's launches as
soon as the Chinese Bureau officials had

Joseph Haber Jr., the recently appoint
ed special administrator of the estate of
the late Michael Mooney, filed a suit yes
terday against the San Francisco Savings
Union to recover $9000 deposited in the
bank by Mooney several years ago. 'He
also asks for interest on that sum at the
rate of 3 per cent, alleging in his com
plaint that at no time since the deposit
was made has any sum been withdrawn
from the bank by Mooney or his heirs.
He claims that the bank refuses to pay
over to him any part of the deposit ex
cept the sum of $550 63.
The suit is the outcome of the recent
exposure in The Call of the peculiar meth
ods of Attorney Hu' Jones, who several
w^eks ago disappeared from the city and
has not since returned. He had charge
of the Mooney estate and is supposed to
have handled it for his own benefit.

The expose has had the salutary effect
of calling the attention of the authorities
at Washington to the necessity for plac
ing more safeguards around the Chinese
Bureau to prevent similar substitutions
in,future. In what are known as "depor
tation" cases where Chinese are arrested
here for being unlawfully in the country
there is no fund provided for taking the
photographs of the prisoners, so as to
render their Identification possible. In or
der that this loophole cf escape might be
stopped up, . United States Attorney
Woodworth telegraphed to. the. authorities
at Washington for permission to photo
graph the seventeen Chinese recently re
turned from the Alaska fisheries with
fraudulent certificates in their possession.
A reply was received yesterday morning
from E. P. Sargent, Commissioner Gen
eral of Immigration, granting permission
to make the necessary expenditure for
that purpose. Commissioner Sargent will
be asked to provide a fund to enable the
bureau and the United States to have the
photos taken of all Chinese* in deportation
proceedings. .
United States Marshal Shine is not tak
ing any chances with Chinese prisoners.
They are all handcuffed tn pairs on being
brought to andffrom the Jail. All the
Chinese habeas corpus and deportation
subjects in the City Prison and the
County Jail In this city were removed
yesterday to the Alameda County Jail.
where they will be kept in future.
Thomas Martin, the oid hackman who
has been taking Chinese for many years
from the United States Marshal's office to
the mail dock, will continue to do so.
There is no evidence Implicating him. as
Gamble has stated that the Chinese were
brought from the jail on foot and allowed
?o escape on reaching the vicinity of the
Appraisers' building.
flee, Mr. Woodworth says that he was
not oresent.on either occasion.
' In view of the assistance afforded by
Deputy Gamble to the authorities, it is
believed that he will not be prosecuted,
but will be used as the chief witness for
the Government The penalty for the of
fense for which he is under arrest is not
more than one year in the County Jail.
The case against Tom Yung, the Du
pont-street merchant arrested for com
plicity In the substitution. Is not consid
ered strong. Only one of the prisoners
has made a statement implicating him.
It was to the effect that Tom. Yun^, gave
iilm $30 to go back to China as one of the
substitutes. This statement Is said to be
entirely uncorroborated, and unless some
thing should develop tending to implicate
Yung by more credible testimony the
prosecution against him may be aban
doned.

M. A. Doran, Miss Anna E. Sullivan and

The demand of Newsom & MeNeill for
$34,114 for building the Noe Valley School
Was ordered paid. "Woodward objected
to the payment of the demand on the al
leged ground that the* work had not been
satisfactorily performed.
Thomas Kelly appeared before the
board and made complaint that his
nephew, Frank Duignan, 13 years of age,
had, been severely beaten by Miss Jean
A. Dwyer, acting principal of the South
End School. Kelly said the black and
blue marks showed on the boy's legs
where the punishment had* been adminis
tered with a rattan. The boy himself ex
hibited his bruises and said . that he and
his sister. Dolly Duignan. had been sus
pended by Miss Dwyer, together with six
other pupils. Kelly filed a written charge
that the boy had been "unmercifully
whipped" by Miss Dwyer, and Superin
tendent of Schools Langdon will investi
gate the matter.
Langdon presented' a resolution Â¦which
was adopted by the board appointing Suz
zalo as a special commissioner of the San
Francisco Board of Education to study
and report upon the school systems of
the large American cities, the services to
be performed without expense to the
board.

' Langdon stated that Suzzalo's resig
nation was of a temporary character only,
as he has granted Suzzalo a- leave of
absence from October 1, 1903, to May 1,
1904, on which date he will be at liberty
to resume his duties as deputy superin
tendent should he so elect.
Henry Suzzalo had resigned his
position to accept a fellowship in edu

with ' unprecedented secrecy. â¢ The fact
that Deputy Gamble had been arrested
arid .released "on bonds was not. divulged,
and in order to throw the newspaper re
porters off the scent the deputy was de
tailed to perform his accustomed duties
in and about the office.
There were certain reasons why the Chi

bitrarily used." He explains further that
such ordinances are always subject to re
view by the courts.
Chief Justice Beatty also writes a con
curring opinion. He says that a munici
pality may pass such measures, but that
counties may not. That the city of San
Francisco happens to be co-terminal with
the county is only incidental, he holds.
He points out that if counties could pass
measures like the ordinance in question
it might arise that there could be no
burials in the State. â
There was no dissenting opinion, al
though Juattce Van Dyke did not partici
pate in the decision.
The court disagrees again with this con
tention, holding that the law mentioned
is wholly negative in. effect, and does not
mean that burials in the exempt terri
tory can be continued indefinitely. The
contestants argue that the ordinance is
"unreasonable." The court denies this
assertion without argument. Lastly the
plaintiffs declare that the measure was
passed for private purposes and from
improper motives. The court says there
is â¢ no evidence to suppor/ such a claim
and therefore it cannot be considered.
COUBT THINKS OTHERWISE.
The plaintiffs contended that a corpor
ation should be exempt from such a
measure. The court declares that a cor
poration has no more rights In the mat
ter than an individual. The plaintiffs
also averred that the act which forbids
burials in San Francisco In any other
place than In existing cemeteries had the
effect of legalizing interments in "the lo
calities designated.
The contestants sought ,to have the or
dinance declared unconstitutional and to
have the authorities enjoined from . en- 1
forcing the measure by criminal prosecu
tion. The lower court upheld. -the action
of the Board of Supervisors and an appeal
to the State's highest tribunal was imme
diately taken.
Article 11, section 11 of the constitution
provides that "Any county, city, town or
township may make and enforce within
its limits all such local police, sanitary
and other regulations as are 1 not In con
flict with the generariaws." The munici
pal charter gives to the Board of Super
visors of the city and county of San
Francisco a like power, stipulating, how
ever, that legislation along such lines
must bo necessary.
The plaintiffs maintained that the Su
pervisors could not declare any act or
place unsanitary unless it was so held in
the laws governing nuisances or had been
so decided by a court. The Supreme
Court asserts that legislative bodies can
pass restrictive or prohibitive laws when
the future health of the community may
be endangered. It Is held also that the
ordinance in question does not conflict
with any general law. r.;:Â»''Â» : i r -
There can be no more Interments of
the dead within the confines of the city
and county of San . Francisco except on
Government property, according, to a de
cision of the Supreme Court rendered yes
terday. The hard fought legal <battle
over this question is at an end and the
Board of Supervisors has won the victory.
The dispute began in the summer of 1901.
Various cemetery associations lose hun
dreds of thousands of dollars by the de
cision.
A few years ago complaints from many
of the city's Inhabitants that a continua
tion of the practice of burying the dead
so close to the dwelling' places of the
living might result seriously from a san
itary standpoint began to arise. The pop
ulation of San Francisco was then, as
now, increasing at an enormous rate and
dwellings were being erected In proximity
to" the cemeteries.
Finally the Board of Supervisors
passed an ordinance making it illegal to
bury the dead anywhere within the mu
nicipal limits, except on land owned by
the United States. The measure of course
would result in great, loss to corporations
controlling cemeteries and to people who
had purchased but had not used burial
plots. Litigation began immediately.
There was much diversity of opinion as
to the legality of the ordinance and great
interest was felt generally in the progress
of the case. The parties ' to the suit
against the city were the Masonic Ceme
tery Association, the Odd Fellows' Ceme
tery Association and Henry Plagemann.
The last named was the owner of an un
used lot in one of the graveyards.
