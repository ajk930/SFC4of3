PORTLAND, Or.. Oct. 23.â The Southern
Pacific announces that next month It will
advance rates on lumber shipments from
this city to San Francisco 50 per cent, or
from $5 to $7 50 a ton. This rate will ap
ply only to lumber shipped from sawmills
that have access to water transportation.
Mills in the Interior will continue to ship
at the rate of $3 10 a ton, in force before
thi railroad made Its last increase in Its
charges. The new tariff is prohibitory to
rail shipments from Portland. Local mills
can ship by water to San Francisco and
compete with interior mills for business
at this Callfomian point. But for southern
interior markets this method Involves
rxtra expense for loading on cars at the
point of discharge. Up to three months
ago the rate from Portland was $3 10. The
railroad vras Ehort of cars and In order
to divert the traffic to water the rate was
raised to 55. This gave the Interior mills
the use of more rolling stock, but there is
still a shortage and the raise announced
for next month is the result.

Business men of Great Falls are already
urging that the case of the- Amalgamated
Copper Company may speedily be brought
before the Supreme Court for considera
tion, as the closing of the electrolytic
smelters means a body blow to the busi
ness activity of Great Falls. Throughout
the State, generally a state of depression
is reflected, and in Butte business is prac
tically/paralyzed,. with fear of a crash
in , the event of ;a prolonged closedown.
Business men are canceling their orders
for winter supplies. 1
As yet no acts of violence have been
reported to the- police, though It Is feared
some difficulty will be experienced In hold

with orders to prevent the gathering of
large crowds.'
It is. conservatively estimated by the
Amalgamated Company officials that be
tween 14,000 and 13.000 men are made idle.
This calculation includes all the men em
ployed by the Amalgamated Company
throughout the State of Montana.
Business men fear the worst should the
suspension continue any length of time,
as the army of Amalgamated employes
is the principal .sustaining factor of
Butte's Industrial life. In Anaconda the
town is practically dependent on the big
Washoe plants for its existence and the

Heinze also sjld that Judge . Clancy's
decision yesterday was in line with the
Northern Securities decision. In answer,
President Scallon said:
"To lawyers and to laymen alike who
happen to be acquainted with the North
ern Securities case, to which Mr. Heinze
refers, his assertion that the provisions
of Judge Clancy's decision are 'very near
ly Identical' with the order Issued by the
Circuit Court of Appeals in the merger
case indicates either gross ignorance on
Mr. Helnze's part or a desire to pervert
the facts. In the Northern Securities
case the order directed the retransf er - of
the stock to its original owners and recog
nized the property rights of the Northern
Securities Company. .Judge Clancy's de
cision, on the contrary, so far as it goes,
declares that the adverse party has no
rights whatever, . prohibits any transfers
and simply proposes to' wipe out the
property rights."
With the exception of small crews man
ning the pumps, all the mines are desert
ed, and as soon as the furnaces can be
cleared of charges and fires drawn the
four smelters of the Amalgamated will
shut down. This will be accomplished
some time to-night or to-morrow morn

An effort will be made by leading citi
zens of the State to have the Supreme
Court advance the hearing on the ap
peal from Judge Clancy's decision in the
case in the hope that a reversal of the
Judgment by the tribunal will Induce the
Amalgamated Copper Company to re
sume. Indignation among the Amalga
mated people Is rife and they are loud in
denouncing the present state of affairs
and declare that all business on the part
of the company will remain at a stand
still until the Boston and Montana re
ceivership matter is finally settled.

The. belief of the Interior Department

such pressure.
Whenever a forest reserve is proclaimed
by the President, according to the gen

having land allotments thereon are en
titled to receive from the Government a
similar amount of territory outside of the
forest reserves or on what is known as
"good land." The forest reserves are wild
territory and the land sells at $1 25 an
acre. The land outside averages between
$5 and $6 an acre. ' â¢ â¢

would be satisfied to cease efforts to dy

stock, was written in Butte by Gravelle,
according to the statement, and the sta
tionery on which It was written was pur
chased In Butte. Gravelle was the active
agent in the plot, being the only one of
the trio free to harass the railway com

to receive $30,000, while the remaining $20,
000 was to be used to secure pardons from
the Governor for the two prisoners at

It is known that a woman was impli

her connection with it may be extremely
distant. This woman lives in Bozeman
and she was the agent through whom
"Whitton hoped to secure his pardon. Her
name was found among the papers taken
from Gravelle's satchel, which was locat

An account ' of _. recent operations at
Tombstone is given by the Tombstone
Prospector:
The Consolidated Mining Company at Tomb
stone is shipping ten to fifteen carloads a week
An average of one carload a day is Â¦ being
shipped from- tha main shaft, whtlo the Silver
Thread, Tranquillity and the Comet contribute
the balance. The station on the 700-foot level
is being cut and Superintendent Walker expects
to have this station complete and â¢ the two
pumps originally Intended for the 800-foot and
inOO-foot levels set up by December 1. Moat
of the ore that is being taken from the shaft
comes from the third and fourth levels, while
Â¦ winze en the 600-foot level also contributes.
The ore bins have been completed. At the
Comet thÂ« number of men has been increased,
and the 300-ft>ot level is being cleaned up and
a new track put In preparatory, to stoplng ore
It is the intention of the company to build a
narrow paupe road from the elding. at Schus
ters to. tho Comet and a branch -to' Eftierald
The Comet ore carries considerable manganese
and Is in demand by the smelters for fluxing.
At the Emerald they have reached 'th* 400- foot
level, and are repairing the shaft. Tha. com
pany' expectB to start up the weat eidÂ«; this
month. The pumps in the main shaft are hand
ling 2,360,000 gallons of water daily.
The Amador Ledger says that the cya
nide plant to handle, the sand and tailings
at the Sand Pile mine, near Forest Home,
has six tanks, each with a capacity of
240 tons. The expectation is that one tank
will be discharged each day. The contract
for the daily delivery of 240 tons of sand
to the cars has been awarded on the basis
of 10 cents per ton.
The Gentle Annie mine, in El Dorado
County, will sink to the 1000 foot point.

men and some of the jinton men made a move
In that direction and 'held eeveral meetings
and a committee was appointed to wait on tho
owners of the Yellow Aster, which they did.
They were courteously received and were
shown through the mine and mills to satisfy
them that there was nothing to negotiate.
That the property was running, and, so- far as
the company was concerned, they had plenty
of men and the strike was a dead issue. The
committee retired seemingly convinced to that
effect. Eome of the smaller properties con

From the annual report of the. Alaska-
Treadwell Gold Mining Company it ap
pears that the gold bullion for the year
ending May 30 amounted to $785,515 from
the mill, which was $1 04 ! per ton, and
$813,448 from the concentrates, or $1,075 per
ton; The expenditures amounted to $373,

two mills. In one 240 stamps were kept
running 265 days and three hours during
the year. In the new stamp mill 300
stamps were run by water power 200 days
and thirteen hours. The development
work of the vear amounted to 6143 feet.
The total tonnage of ore taken out was

NEW YORK, Oct. 23,-The nature of
the defense which Charles M. Schwab will
make to the charges that have been made
against him In connection with the affairs
of the wrecked United States Shipbuilding
Company was sharply outlined during the
latter part. of the hearing before Exam
iner Ollphant lata to-day. Lewis Nixon
was still on the stand, and tinder cross
examination by counsel for Schwab there
was an effort , to show that the corpora
tion would not have succeeded if the
$2,000,000 promised under the Sheldon plan
of reorganization had been made avail
â¢ able, and that it could not have continued
Its existence even- If it had "received tile
much sought for $900,000 which It is al
leged- was . wrongfully withheld by the
Bethlehem company. .
i Guthrie showed by Nixon that the J300.
600" would have been absorbed without re
lieving, the company of all financial em
barrassment which it suffered, and then
asked if It would have been honest to the
other creditors if the Interest charges on
account of bonds had been paid on July
1, the date of the crisis in the affairs of
the concern.
The witness was again questioned as to
the representations made in the earlier
shipbuilding combination prospectus and
the correctness of the statement that Ed
win Hawley, E. H. Harrtman. James Still
man and other financiers were to serve
as I directors. Nixon said . he understood
the statement was correct.
The underwriting agreement which
Charles M. Schwab signed was produced
by the representatives of the Trust Com
pany of the Republic at the request of
Attorney Guthrie, identified by Nixon and
offered as evidence.
Nixon testified that vendors became un
derwriters to the extent of several hun
dred thousand dollars. He, Henry T.
Scott -and Mr. Hyde, all vendors, became
underwriters. The witness identified the
agreements signed by himself and Mr.
.Scott, and they were offered In evidence.
It is said that the purpose of this evi
dence Is to show that tho complainants
are holders of but a small amount of tha
bonds.
The examination of Nixon was not con
cluded and will be resumed at the next
hearing, which is set for a week from
Monday.
The mystery surrounding the purpose
and destination of the check of $250,000
.which has figured in the investigation of
the affairs of the United States Shipbuild
ing Company waa partially explained to
day by. a former official of the Trust Com
pany of the Republic. He said that the
check waa drawn to cover a payment on
one of the shipyard plants, and that after
It had been made out It was found neces
sary to cut the sum into a couple of
smaller checks. It was one of a series of
numbered checks, and rather than de
stroy it It was put through the bank by
the Trust Company itself.
The money, called for by the check was
not withdrawn from the bank. What sub
sequently became of any money that re
mained after the plants were paid for has
not been shown at any point In the in
quiry, but it is asserted that this particu
lar check was not cashed and. therefore Is
of no importance ,to, the inquiry. , '/

Prevent "Good Time."
JACKSON, Mich., Oct. 23.â Under a de

Supreme Court nearly one hundred pris
oners In the prison here will be released
at once. John Harney, a prisoner under a
ten years' sentence for burglary, should
have been released some weeks ago if al

carried the case to court, where It was
held that the sentences Harney had

against him in deciding his claim for
"good time." The Supreme Court coin
cided with this view. The decision will

CINCINNATI, Oct. 23.â John K. Brown,
former . cashier of the Union Banking
Company of New Holland, Ohio,. was, be
fore the discovery of his embezzlement of
$103,000, one of the -best-known and most
popular and most trusted banking men
in the county in which he lived. He had
been 1 cashier of the bank for about fif
teen years and during that time, by his
affability and courtesy, had increased by
a largo number -the- list of -depositors,
drawing many from the country surround
ing New Holland. He was a prominent
church worker and often during the week,
It has since been ascertained, he left Sun
day-school and church meetings to go to
Circleville," Ohio, to place orders In the
bucket-shops. By his connection with the
church and 'Various lodges, -and by his
seeming close attention to business, the
officers of the bank and the publlo in gen
eral had conie to have perfect confidence
in- him. He stood ; high In business and
society circles.- .
Among the positions which he held waa
that of treasurer of a Knights of Pythias
lodge, treasurer of Masonic Temple As
sociation, grand master Masonic Lodge,
member of Eastern Star; member of
Democratic County Committee; banker of
local lodge, M. "W. of W.; clerk of School
Board, member of Methodist s church
choir. Â¦ . ,
Much of thÂ«> money is supposed to have
been lost In bucket-shops in this city. He
is known to have done an extensive busi
ness with Cincinnati brokers. , He always
.made it a point when visiting -Cincinnati
on. Sundays, which he did frequently, to
attend church, and almost always prof
fered his. services with choir of the
church at which he was in ' attendance.
His wife and. two children live at New
Holland, and many of his friends - there
have announced their ' determination to
stick by him in' his* present trouble. â¢
Brown Was One of the Most Trusted
Banking Men in Ohio.
"I surrendered myself," he said, "be
cause I could, not bear the thought of be
ing a fugitive any longer. I deserted my
family and ruined my life by 'taking the
money, but I am now' ready tcs go back
and suffer the penalty of | the â¢ law. Â¦Â¦ In
my trusted position I was given oppor
tunities to do wrong * ana the dazzling
temptation of speculation overcame me.
I plunged a little at first, then losing, I
became tangled deeper 'in the meshes of
the game and finally awoke to the realiza
tion that honor and hope were gone and
that my embezzlement must soon be dis
covered. '
' "As quietly as I could I left the place
where every one held me- in esteem. Then
my whole thought was. escape. I wan
dered from place to place, but a haunting
fear and a remorse grew upon me as I
went and in desperation I gave myself
over to ' the police. J I have been in this
city about ten days. During that time
life has been a misery and the only way
of lifting the burden from my mind'
seemed to be in the course I have taken."
â ? -' /
WAS HELD IN ESTEEM. /
Haunted by the ghost of crime, John
K. Brown, an absconding bank cashier,'
surrendered himself to the police of this
city yesterday. His flight from Justice
became too great a strain, and -he rei
lieved suspense by voluntarily closing the
doors of the upon himself. This
man, wanted in New.Holland.O... for an
embezzlement of $108,000. has eluded, de
tectives for more than- two month*. He
, has sought refuge in different cities, and
> arrived here ten days ago. ,The constant
feaT of arrest and the thought that the
minions of the law were dogging his foot
steps" passed from apprehension to terror,
and the desire to escape gradually waned,
until, bearded and wan, he walked to the
Hall of Justice and found solace in the
hope of punishment.
For nearly fourteen years Brown was
cashier of the Union Banking Company
in New Holland. He was well known
throughout the State of Ohio and was
well connected in Cincinnati. Ha has a
wife and two sons and his reputation .had
been above reproach. There was no con
fidence that the banking company did not
repose In him. He was trusted with Its
affairs, and large sum's of money came
into his possession from day to day. As
a man he was held In the most profound
respect and he was one of the leading
citizens of the county.
On - the morning of August 8 v a sensa
tion awoke his fellow townsmen. Brown
did not appear at his desk as usual, and
ugly rumors of a shortage in the bank's
funds were heard on the street. An in
vestigation was commenced and two days
later the bank closed its doors arid the
directors made the announcement that
$103,003 had been stolen and that their once
trusted employe was an absconder and a
thief. Detective agencies and police de
partments throughout the country were
notified and the hunt for the man began.
Soon after Brown left it came to
light that speculation in stocks had
wrought his downfall. He had been tak
ing money that was not his own for more
than a year, and in trying to retrieve
losses occasioned by unprofitable invest
ments he plunged deeper and deeper into
crime. When he awoke at last to the enor
<pity of his debt and when he realized
"that discovery was Inevitable. he prepared
for his flight and accomplished it. He had
little of the money left, and says that he
is almost penniless now. r -<"AH Â¦. that he
realized from his thefts passed into the
hands, of brokers, and his Ill-gotten gains
profited him but, little. ,

While copper deposits are reported, gold
is the output for which Tuolumne is re
nowntd. In thÂ« east belt veins are found
in varying size and position. Some of
the main points of variation between the
n.other lode and the east belt ore bodies
are that the latter are usually smaller
and of high grade and more ba6ic. To
the west of the definite line of the mother
lode there are scattering .mines, some of
which have produced copper in addition
to cold. These bodies of ors are not
found in contiuuous lines.
Most of the quartz mines are worked
through inclined, shafts, which follow
veins that are often quite crooked. Open
ing the veins by vertical shafts has not
always been ! proven to be practicable.
The ground is reported to stand well,
ordinarily, and timbering is therefore not
expensive. The timber needed on the
mother lode comes from' tne pino region
to the east. Pumps are found to be an
exception in the smaller mines, as most
of them are dry and the water can be
handled by skips. Three sources of power
are relied upon, wood, water and oil. The
latter is cheap and plenty. The wood is
becoming: exhausted and Is used only
where a plant is situated in the immediate
vicinity of a pine grove, in which case
the fuel costs from !' J) to S per cord
delivered. There is only one ditch sys
tem, which heads far up in the mountains.
â¢ These are. the ..essential facts that a
practical mining man would wish to know
as a preliminary to making a personal
investigation of the resources of Tuo^
lumne County having investment in view.
In addition to these general statements
the mining bureau publication gives a
detailed account of the various mining
properties in the county ad also supplies
a topographical map showing the exact
location of each known mineral deposit,
from which the reader may ascertain just
how far he must go from any specified
town or station on the railroad to arrive
at any particular mine. "Whether a mine
is developed or is only a prospect Is
clearly shown, so that there may be no
possible misrepresentation.
MINING CONVENTION.
It is reported by the bureau that* placer
mining, which originally opened up the
mining resources of Tuolumne, has prac
tically been given up as the gravel de
posits have been washed. Drift mining
is not active, although there may be
unworked bodies of gravel in the Table
Mountain channel. Some of the gravel
deposits were extensively worked in for
mer years. Gravel is being opened near
Cherokee and east from Groveland. Pock
et mining supports many miners near
Tuttletown and Sonora. This method al
lows three or four men at each mine to
work alonjr a- vein for the values found
in rich spots or pockets. Such properties
require little outlay and are often held
unpatented and worked by the owners or
under -royalty. Hydraulic mining has not
assumed great importance in the county,
although there are bodies of gravel that
could be worked by that process. Granite
and marble are being quarried to a con
siderable extent. An unlimited supply of
limestone is to be had.
DISUSED METHODS,
The Mining' Bureau. finds that the; gold
output of Tuolumne County comes almost
exclusively from l frÂ«e milling quartz bod
ies, which are worked .particularly along
the mother lode between -the towns of
Jacksonville and Jamestown. The mother
lode, which consists of several more or
less continuous quartz veins, enters the
county near Tuttletown and can be traced
almost continuously in a southeasterly di
rection, across the qp'unty. The average
dip is about 70 degrees from the horizon
tal and toward the northeast. Little de
velopment has taken place on the lode
seuth of the Tuolwmne River.

Of the total number of steerage aliens,
613,1-46 were males and 243,900 were fe
males, of whom 102,431 were less than
14 years of age. There were of these
3341 who could read, but could not write,

read and write of 668,038. " The total
amount of money brought, by them into
the United States was $16,117,573.
The Commissioner refers to the grave
danger in this country found in the colo
nization of alien communities In : our
great cities. "Such colonies," he says,
"are a menace to the physical, social,
moral and political security of the coun
try."" Removed v from the ' sweat shops
and slums of the great cities and given
the opportunity to acquire a home, every
alien, however radical his theories of
government and individual rights may
have been, will become a conservative
supporter in theory, and practice of those
institutions under whose benign protec
tion he has acquired and can defend his
household goods. Suitable legislation' is
therefore strongly urged to establish
agencies by means of which, either with
or without the co-operation of the
States, aliens shall be made acquainted
with the resources of the country at
large, the industrial needs of the various
sections In both skilled and unskilled
labor, the cost of living, the wages paid,
the price and capabilities of the lands,

The taking of testimony in the suit of
Archbishop Patrick W. Riordan against
Mrs. Belle Sprague and her husband,
Richard Sprague, was resumed yesterday
in the United States Circuit Court.
Peter F. Dunne began the morning
session by addressing the jury on behalf
of his clients, contending that the foun
tain agreement was invalid because at
the time that Ryland Wallace signed the
name of Mrs. Belle Donahue to It, to
gether with his own as her attorney, he
did not hold the power of attorney, Mr3.
Donahue beinir in this State at the time
the document was signed and executed.
He also contended that the document
was of no moment In the case because it
had been executed without any consid
eration. On both these vital pjlnts the
attorney attacked the testimony of Gar
ret McEnerney as not to be believed
against the testimony of Mr. Wallace.
T. C. Van Ness closed the argument on
behalf of Archbishop. Riordan and urged
the jurors to take the two agreements
with them and give them careful study
in the Jury-room before deciding upon
their verdict.
Judge Morrow, in charging the jury, in
structed them that If they should find In
favor of Archbishop Riordan, the plain
tiff, they should give their verdict for
$21,797 95, which was the sum sued for plus
the interest at 7 per cent. The Jury re
tired at 4:35 p. m. to deliberate.
At 10 o'clock the Jury was locked up for
the night.

MANY LATE ARRIVALS.
Â» There having been many dinners before
the ball, the guests were late in
ing. But by 11 'the affair was In ' full
Miss Gibbons looked charming, in pale
pink â¢ mull, garnished with pink rosebuds
and a pink sash. V
Miss Short, dainty ever, was captivating
In a . white shirred frock, simply trimmed
with a 'soft white sash.
Miss Murison was unquestionably one of
the belles of the ball in a dainty little
frock of white point d'esprlt f over pink
Bilk. The shirrings about the skirt were
especially effective.
One of the most exquisite gowns seen
was that worn by Mrs. Morit ew, of
white crepe, heavily trimmed with rare
Irish point. She wore many beautiful
corsage Jewels.
Miss McNear was striking In a pure
white gown of point d'esprit. .
Miss McCalla wore white, and she made
a dainty picture." _
Miss Ethel Hastings appeared in a
clinging gown of blue crepe.
Distinguished by her beauty and the
splendor of her gown* was Mrs. John D.
Spreckels Jr.' Her robe was of white
crepe, exquisitely embroidered in spangles
and oddly ; trimmed with long ;- silken
fringe. She wore a spray of scarlet roses
at thte edge of the low. corsage.
Mrs. Lowrie, wife of Colonel Lowrie of
Georgia, wore : a Â¦; courtly gown of black
chantllly over white taffeta.
Miss May : Foulkes made an interesting
figure in a Parisian frock of white chif
fon.
Among the best gowned women. were:
Mrs. Voorhies, who wore a beautiful robe
of white brocade trimmed with Irish
poUat; Miss Marie Voorhies, In a pale pink
frock of embroidered mull with low cor
sage; Mrs. J. Malcolm Henry was re
splendent in a robe of white panne velvet
with a low bodice; about her throat was
a beautiful string of pearls with a large
pendant of diamonds. Miss Maye Col
burn never looked more stunning than in
the black glitter gown she wore last night.
It set off her blonde coloring exquisitely.
Miss Mabel Watkins wore a charming
frock of pale blue mousseline de sole, p
Mrs. Ira Pierce was beautiful in a white
gown, elaborately trimmed with heavy
lace.
To Mrs. Alfred Hunter Voorhies, the
president of the chapter, Is due much, of
the credit for the results, likewise to the
other patronesses, who were Mrs. Arthur
\V. Foster, Mrs. William M. Gwin, Mrs.
William H.' Herrin, Mrs. William B. Col
lier, Mrs. Selden Wright, Mrs. Wakefield
Baker, Mrs. Phoebe -Hearst, Mrs. John
Garber, Mrs, Eleanor Martin, Mrs. Ynez
Shorb White, Mrs. William L. Duff and
Mrs>William B. Pritchard.
Pursuant to her promise, Mrs. Eleanor
Martin returned from the East especially
to attend the ball.
That the affair was a social success is
conceded; likewise was it a fair financial
success. At any rate, many friendless
veterans will be enabled thereby to find
a haven of comfort when overtaken by
illness or misfortune. And above and be
yond the beauty, the gowns, the jewels,
the joys of the ball comes that feature,
the humanitarianism that lies beneath It
all.'
BALL WAS A SUCCESS.
Chapter of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy proved an affair that
will linger long in the annals of society as
a function of unusual brillianceâ and, bet
ter still, as a function that will bring
good cheer into the hearts of the "men.
who wore the gray."
Such gowns! Such stunning women!
Such gorgeous trappings of wealth! And
it all gravitates to the. sweet cause of
charity. The women who carried the af
fair to such a splendid successâ these
women of the Southlandâ have ever been
famous for their charm and gracious hos
pitality. It Is part and parcel of their per
sonality.
Then there were the buds, who always
bring In their wake a breezy, buoyant
air, and the stately belles, to whom the
ball- was simply one of many. Then, too,
were the bankers and their ladies, many
of whom are from the South and of kin
to the women who planned the affair of
last night.
The new ballroom was ornamented
solely by Its own beauty, the brilliant
lights glinted the gold traceries with
splendid effect. About the casement where
the orchestra sat a little forest of palms
had sprung up, but in dazzling relief as
to color, were the ebon and scarlet silken
furnishings, newâ very new for the dames
and damsels who deigned to rest upon
them.

swing and a charming picture was pre
sented. But why so many handsome men
stood steadfastly unmoved by the rhythmic
music and the pretty maids is a hard con
jecture. Some of the likeliest men stood
in the recesses chatting during the entire
affairâ and they were dancing men, too.
Scandalous, wasn't It?
Supper was served In the ladies' grill
and there is where mirth of the real kind
prevailed. It always happens that many
people take their, pleasure seriously, and
their dancing almost mournfully. But
when it comes to sitting down at a dainty
table, with a dainty maid. In a dainty
supper-room, somehow they thaw out
even the grumpiest fellows are amenable
to those conditions. And thus will many
pleasant memories remain of the first
SAN DIEGO, Oct. Â».â A branch of the
Raja Yoga School at Point Loma is to bÂ«
established here by Mrs. Tlngley. Ac
cording to rumor the incentive for start
ing the school at this time is that there
are a number of children out of the public
schools because the Board of Education is
strictly enforcing the law regarding vac
cination. A good many parents here, as
elsewhere, do not believe in vaccination
and many more do not believe In compul
sory vaccination. Parents have therefore
kept their children away from school
rather than have them vaccinated. These
parents will be particularly invited to
send children to the new school, which

SANTA CRUZ, Oct. 23.â The Eattera
Hotel, built In the early 'SO's. was burned
early this morning. It was a. four-story
frame structure of thirty rooms and was
owned by F. A. Ilihn. Many of the guests
experienced great difficulty In making
their way out through the suffocating
smoke. There was no Insurance on the
builiding or contents.

inally an academy, conducted by Mr. and
Mrs. Pioda. Then for ten years it served
as the Congregational parsonage. Twen
ty-five years ago it was remodeled and
enlarged and fitted up for Qulncy Hall

SEATTLE, Oct. 21â ThÂ« steamer Lydia
Thompson of tiie Puget Sound Navigation
Company plying between Seattle and
"Whatcom ran ashore on Smiths Island In
a dense tog this morning- at 8 o'clock. An
Investigation showed that little or no
damage had been sustained by the vessel,
and Purser Johnson waa dispatched to
Port Townsend to get assistance.
Johnson was lucky In securing a small
gasoline launch which was at the Island
at thÂ» time and arrived late this after
noon. The services of the tug: Tacoma

SAN JOSE, Oct. 23.â There is big rivalry
over securing water rights in the Mount
Hamilton range, and ranchers with any
kind of a water supply find no difficulty in
disposing of their lands. Both the Spring
Valley Water Company and the Bay Cit
ies Water Company have buyers in the
field. Three options on lands were filed
to-day in the Recorder's office, by which
John U. Smith, W. L. Garrett and Joseph
Fisher agree to sell 160 acres each at
sums varying from $1500 to $2000 each. The
options are secured in the namge of
George A. de Prez.
The lands are located six miles east of
Mount Hamilton, and are undoubtedly in
connection with some plan to utilize the
water of that section by one of the two
companies. The Spring Valley is securing
rights to drain the watersheds into the
big reservoir to be built in Calaveras Val
ley. In the southern end of the range the
Bay Cities Company wants the waters for
a reservoir at Coyote, and is digging a
tunnel to drain the shed secured by the
Spring Valley. A big legal battle Is Im

Among the irrigation structures illus
trated by detailed drawings and data as
to material and cost are headsrates ef
canals, waste and regulating gates, a
rating flume, waste ways, outlet gates,
flumes, lifting . apparatus for hcadgates
and aqueducts, a weir for measuring
water and the dam of the Bear River
Professor Elwood Mead, director of ir
rigation at the University of California,
advises the- farmers and fruit growers of
California and the rest of the country
to build, irrigation ditches of the most
enduring material while they are. at it.
In a series of Investigations 'he has been
engaged in he flnda-that after all the most
economical Irrigation structures are those
that cost the most at first. . \
Professor Mead's findings are embodied
in a report to the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture, of which he is chief
of the bureau of irrigation Investigation.
This was submitted under the title "Plans
of Structures in Use on Irrigation Canals
of the United States," from drawings
exhibited by officials of experiment sta
tions at Paris in 1900 and at Buffalo in
1901. The drawings and the accompany
ing notes as to the cost and durability
and usefulness of various types of irriga
tion works constructed )n different parts
of the arid regions, for the last twenty
years will, be of much practical value to
engineers and others interested in the
construction of irrigation works.
It is Professor Mead's conclusion that
Irrigation structures of perroanfent ma
terial are less costly In the end than those
of a more temporary character. In this
report he presents records of durability
of much value in determining whether or
not the large use of wood as material In
irrigation structures can wisely be con
tinued under existing conditions.
<; There are certain facts," says Profes
sor Mead, "which indicate that the use
of timber in irrigation structures, which
formerly prevailed, -must in time give way
to the use of more durable materials.
Wooden structures were a conspicuous
feature of earlier irrigation works be
cause timber was abundant and cheap.
But for several years timber has been
rising in price, while the cost of masonry
has in many sections been gTeatly re
duced. It is now the belief of many en
gineers that when durability and expense
of repairs are taken into account perma
nent structures are the most economical.
The information here given seem3 to show
that ten years is apparently as long as
wooden structures can be relied upon, al
though some of those illustrated here
have been in use for twice that period.
It Is hoped that these records of uervice
will aid engineers in making plans for
the works to be built in the srA of rapid
development upon which we appear now
to be. entering." ..â'-..

Dr. Gladding is guarding the health of
West Berkeley, where his home is, and
he has interested himself in seeing that
the thing* that breed disease are kept
moving in the direction of the bay.
Incidentally, Dr. Gladding is one of the
bondsmen of Sam Fisher, who wrecked a
rummage sale in Berkeley a few days ago.
I am opposed to the rummage ra> only a*
it affects the health of the people. The stuff
ther sell at these sales is really dangerous.
It iÂ« usually cast-off clothing gathered f rO m
â¢verj-where. A lot of It comes frora houses
where there has been Fickness. It haÂ« never
been propwlr fumigated and Is likely to start
a. plarue. In house* where scarlet fpver has
been people ought to burn every bit of clothing,
but they don't. They think washing is good
enough. The result is that the disease* germ
is still there, ready to pounce on some unof
fending person and Infect scores.
It's all right for poor people to buy from
these sales. If they can buy things cheap, of
course, that's money In their pockets. But
they stand a chance of getting sick. Then the.
sickness costs them probably a hundred times
what they have saved. If not their lives.

The doctor is opposed to rummage sales

the health of the people that patronize
them, not because he has anything
against the women or the benefits they
confer on the pocketbooks of purchasers.
And as a member of the Board of Health,
Dr. Gladding proposes at the next meet
ing to introduce legislation that will sup
prees these church functions. He says he
has good reasons for his attitude against
the tottering rummage sale, and here are
a few of them:

acres of the land on which the city is now
located, at the rate of 26 cents an acre.
It was a portion of the pueblo of San
Diego and he induced the people to hold
an election and vote to sell It at auction.
The auction was held and he was the only
bidder. Of this property he sold more
than a million dollars' worth, and he gave
of his wealth most liberally to every pub
lic institution until he found, at the break

had taken wines.

runaway on- Park street this evening and
saved a Japanese bicycle rider, F. Ham
ada. from being trampled to death be
neath the hoofs of & frightened horse
after the animal had dragged the little
brown man 150 feet
Miss Hammond was leaving the office
of Hammand & Hammond. 1422 Park
street, in a surrey, intending to drive to
her home on Buena Vista avenue. Ham
ada came scorching along on his wheel
and struck the horse as the vehicle was
turning. He clung to the shaft, while the
alarmed equine reared and plunged ahead
wildly. Miss Hammond retained her pres
encB of mind, and with all her strength
pulled up the scared horse after it had
traversed half the block. Hamada was
rescued from under the surrey and con
veyed to a drug store. HÂ© was found to
be severely bruised, but no bones were
fractured. His wheel was demolished.
Mrs. Sheak'.ey was formerly the wife
of Benjamin Pinkney. a prominent ranch
er of San Joaouin County. Befors her
illness she had been residing at the Young
Women's Christian Association rooms,
1224 Franklin street. She was in charge
of a large garment factory in this city.
The physician said to-day that there
was absolutely no hope for Mrs. Sheak
ley's recovery and that death might oc
cur at any time.
The bride and groom had planned a
much happier celebration of the nuptials.
A year ago they had been engaged and
the wedding day was set. But before the
time arrived Mrs. Pinkncy was stricken
with the illness that has brought her to
her deathbed. The grcom prospective
was called East on business and his
fiancee was removed to the Fabiola Hos
pital, where she submitted to an operation
for cancer. Afterward complications de
veloped which led the attending surgeon
to become gravely alarmed. Dr. Kitch
ings. in charge, had the patient removed
to his residence after she had been ad
vised that recovery was hopeless.
With much difficulty Mr. Sheakley was
located by police efforts in Milwaukee.
He was notified of Mrs. Pinkney's condi
tion and he hastened to Oakland, .uriv
lng early this week. Convinced after his
arrival that his betrothed could not long
survive, the unhappy man expressed the
desire to wed the woman of his choice
before death should separate them. Ar
rangements were speedily made and Dr.
Baker was called. The witnesses were
Dr. Kitchings and his sister.
It was at tha residence of Dr. John T.
Kitchings, corner of Eighth and Clay
streets, that this death-bed marriage was
solemnized. Here the dying bride had a
short time aero been taken that her last
moments on earth might be peaceful and
watched with utmost care.
With the death angel hovering over her
bedside, Mrs. Ellen E. Plnkney became
the wife yesterday afternoon of Arthur
At. Sheakley, a manufacturer of Stock
ton, the pathetic union being solemnized
by the B*v. Ernest E. Baker, pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church of this
city. . "'"
Afflicted with an Incurable disease,
which had almost run its course, the
bride's attendants were the gentle nurses
who with kindly ministrations* soothed
and calmed the woman while the words
were said that made her the wife of the
man whose devotion was so touchtngly
exhibited.

â¢ Soon after he took charge of the pulpit
he assisted' In a movement to have the
church, which was then at Thirty- fourth
and Adeline streets, moved to It's present
site at; Grove and Thirty-sixth streets,
where a new church was erected. His
resignation shortly afterward caused con
siderable surprises as it. was expected
that/after moving into the new neighbor
hjod he would wish to remain and see it
established. on a (Inn footing.
.Just what has caused the estrangement
between the young minister and hjs wife
is not made public. The attorney of rec
ord, in behalf of Mrs. Bayley, is Earl H.
Webb, who has an office In San Francisco.
Rev. Mr. Bayley is a nephew; of Mrs.
Wetherbee of Fruitvale. 'He Is not en
gaged in ministerial work at the present
time.
The Bayleys were married .in this city
on July 1, 18&6. Mrs. Bayley was formerly
Miss . Minnie Henderson, her home being
in Fruitvale. When Rev. Mr. Bayley re
signed from his church some time ago it
was announced that his health was poor
and that he needed a rest. It w.as stated
that he proposed to leave on a trip to
Europe. Prior to assuming the pastorate
of the Fourth 1 . Congregational Church he
had done missionary work for the Salva
tion Army in India.
Suit for divorce was begun to-day liy
Mrs. Minnie Bayley against the Rev. Al
fred Bayley, . formerly pastor of the
Fourth Congregational Church in this
city, on the ground of desertion. At the
home j of the Bayleys at .288. Twenty
fourth street everything is in confusion
and preparations are being made by Mrs.
Bayley to leave the premises. No one
was there that could throw any light as
to the cause of the filing of the suit other
than that stated. **-

of the Thirty-eighth r Assembly District

speech by stating in the most emphatic
terms that he. had never received any
part of the $25,000 that the city had ap
propriated to fight Its interests in the
question of the Spring Valleyr Water
Works. He referred to the present labor
party as a thing of the past. Originally
the party thought It had a strong Issue,
and Schmitz won on that Issue, but now
that Abe Ruef had appeared /In the back

The City Front Federation yesterday re
quested the Board of Supervisors to com*
pel the Southern Pacific Company to open
Sixteenth street from Kentucky to Illinois
so as to give free access to the drydock.
The communication on tho subject says:
There are fourteen tracks laid on Six
teenth street, between Kentucky and Illi
nois, which are continually blocked with
cars, so that it is impossible for any per
son to go to the drydock unless he climbs
under or over the cars. This cannot be
done without danger to life and limb.
There are 300 men employed at the dry
dock and as some of the mechanics are
advanced in years It works a great hard
ship on them.

Biblical learning and also for their love
for religious art and for collections of val

were used in the Jewish ceremonies.
Besides the son In this city Abraham
Benguiat is survived by four other sons.

Schmitz Speaks in Two Assembly
Districts. -
ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING.
Mayor Schmitz spoke before one of the
largest meetings of the 'campaign last
night at Eintracht Hall â¢ at 237 Twelfth
street. The ln-mer.Fe hall was crowded
and the Mayor was cheered repeatedly.
There was a large crowd of other speak
ers and a good deal of a musical pro
gramme thrown in. Charles. A. Siskron
was chairman.
. The Mayor waxed warm on the issues
of the campaign. In part he said:
This meeting to-night gives me much pleas
ure. It is my first visit to this district, and
the attendance is gratifying. It speaks well
Xyr the success of the party.
We may not have orators In our party, but
we have men with true hearts, men who will
do the city some good when elected.
This Is not a mud-sllnglng campaign on our
part. I do not believe in that policy, and I
shall always refrain from It.
, We have no newspapers to paint our pictures
on their front pages or run our names In large
type. But I care not for that, what I want
and what I have always striven for is to have
my name written deep in the hearts of the
people, the plain people.
Twd years ago when I appeared before the
people of San Francisco I had not support
and was unknown. My slogan has always
been fair dealing with the whole peoDle ajid
not any particular class: I have adhered to
this principle and tried to demonstrate that
I was not Mayor for any one class, but Mayor
for all the people.
Two years ago they said that If I was. elected
it would drive capital away from this city,
but during the last two years capital has been
seeking investment here and the city has grown
prosperous.
If after a fair Investigation It is not evident
that I have done my duty as Mayor of this
city and treated all alike I do not ask for
your votes. Would I say this If I were afraid
of an investigation?
I could have done more had I had a Board
of Supervisors to work with me. I did not
even have the good faith of the commissions.
Any proposition that I brought up for the
benefit of the city, they voted down, fearing
that it would redound to my credit. When I
saw a way to save the city $140,000 by cutting
down the budget they voted me down. I have
been doing good work, and with the support
of a full Union Labor ticket I can make this
one of the grandest cities In the United States.
I have bettered the schools. When I came Into
office they were in a bad condition. Children
did nnt have room and the buildings were in
a tumble-down state. I added forty new school
rooms and had the buildings renovated and re
paired.
Now It Is not a good business proposition
to change this administration. I have Â«very
reason to believe that you are content, and if
I am re-elected the conditions will be better. â¢
Stand by me and the ticket if you do not
want to be downed as you were before the
party was formed.
A large crowd turned out at Devisadero
Hall last night to hear Schmitz and ether
candidates on the ticket Dan Moriarlty
presided. Among those who spoke were
Powel Fredrick, Dr. Dillon and a full
list of the Union Labor candidates for
the office of Supervisors. ;â¢ ',

Committee in the celebrated campaign in
California which culminated In 40,000 ma

dressed two small and unenthuslastlc
meetings last night. Worse than all for
Lane the Iroquois Club Is "kicking the
stuffln' " out of the Democratic ticket
because L. F. Bylngton went back on the
party by accepting a Union Labor nomi
nation. The Iroquois braves are brave
enough to fight for party principles. At a
meeting of the warriors at Pythian Cas
tle last night a motion to invite Candi
date Lane to address the club next Friday
evening was badly defeated. The opposi
tion was on the ground that L. F. Bying
ton and other candidates on the ticket
: had violated their platform pledges im
mediately upon the adjournment of the
convention and therefore could not be ex
pected to respect the platform pledges
after election. It is the judgment of the
Iroquois tribe that the contest for Mayor
of San Francisco is between Crocker and
Schmitz. The big Schmitz meeting at
Eintracht Hall last night, where Lane a
few nights since failed to rally men
enough to occupy one-third of the hall
space, was an object lesson to the braves.
It becomes more and more apparent every
day that Democratic voters must choose
between Crocker and Schmitz,
HENRY J. CROCKER'S position as
the leader in the race for Mayor is
so clearly defined that the_ odds In
the betting are largely in his favor:
It was foreshadowed several days
ago that the McNab press Intended
to make a great flourish toward the close
of the campaign, hence no one is sur
prised at the talk of a "whirlwind" finish
and an "avalanche" for Lane. Everybody
on the political line sees Lane's finish.
The *> Republican business men some
years ago left their party in a local cam
paign and gave their support to James D.
Phelan. because they believed that a na
tive son, brought up in the city and hav
ing the interests of the community at
heart, should have an opportunity to make
a record in the Mayor's office. Phelan
was not a professional office holder nor a
persistent job chaser and Republicans
who are noted for their intelligence and
independence gave Mr.' Phelan their sup
port and elected - him. The Republican
candidate for Mayor in this campaign is
a native son, a young man, an excellent
business man and a citizen whose integ
rity, manly strength and executive abili
ties are recognized In every district of the
town. Henry J. Crocker is not a Job
chaser nor & professional politician.
The Republican elector may exercise
the voter's privilege of supporting whom
soever he chooses, but he will npt aban
don a good candidate of his own political
faith to support an inferior nominee of
the opposition.
REPUBLICANS TJUTTE.
The Republican party of San Francisco
is united In its support ,of Henry J.
Crocker and the most enthusiastic advo
cates of his election are the Republican
business men. The Democratic business
men are next In line for Mr. Crocker.
Stories to the effect that Union Labor
men are leaving the camp of Mayor
Schmitz and enlisting under the banner
of Lane and McNao should be accepted
as the gossip of the ignorant and un
trained. Labor union men In the densely
populated strongholds of the party do not
fancy A. Ruef, bur they will vote for
Schmitz with Ruef on his neck rather
than for McNab's man Lane. The choice
is made on the principle that "the devil
you do know Is better than the devil you
don't know."
No doubt quite a number of independent
workingmen who trained with the Labor
party two years ago will get Into line for
Henry J. Crocker, because he Is not the
candidate of a boss. Moreover, Mr. Crock
er goes into the camps of the working
men and shows to his fellow citizens of
the Union Labor party just what kind of
a man he I*. He is a successful business
man and it Is quite well understood
wherever he goes that a successful busi
ness man Is a worklngman In the broadest
sense of the term. * Mr. Crocker Is a first
class campaigner. He is good-natured,
RECEIVES NEWS OF HIS
AGED FATHER'S DEATH
warm-hearted and clear-headed. He Is
self-reliant.
WOBKHTOHKEN PERCEIVE.
Working people are qu.ick to perceive
the difference between self-reliance ani
conceit. Crocker, by his energy and su
perb capacity for hard work, has over
come many obstacles in the path of prog
ress, just as men In the general fields of
toll overcome impediments and achieve
beneficial results. '
The workers In the shops, factories and
yards listen to the Republican nominee.
They grasp his hand and tell him they
like his style. The campaign committee
Is In possession of Information that con
vinces every member that a great change
of sentiment In favor of the Republican
nominee has taken place recently In the
strongholds of the Labor party.
It Is common knowledge In political cir
cles that Schmitz and Ruef are planning
for a big demonstration on the line of
class prejudice to solidify the so-called
labor vote. The "whoop-up" will take
place next Saturday evening or the night
before election. There seems to be an
unlimited supply of money In the Schmitz
fight. It is common gossip at the City
Hall that the Mayor does not give one
hour's time a day to the duties of his
office. He is campaigning early and late.
The hope of re-election and the prospects
of another trip East in the Interest of the
Democratic party stimulate him to great
activity. Ruef has already promised the
Mayor a leave of absence and the hint
is thrown out that Parry and the colt
may accompany the Mayor on the next
junket to New York.
Supervisors, who has made a fine record
while in office and who is striving for re
election as a candidate on the Republican
ticket, was next Introduced and delivered
a good speech. In part Mr. Eggers said:
Ladles and Gentlemen asd Fellow Republi
cans: I know you arÂ« all Republicans and I
know you all came here to-night to see and
liEten to cur standard bearer, Henry J-
Crocker. (Applause.)
After the Republican convention placed Hen
ry J. Crocker at the head of our ticket, there
were a great many people who thought and felt
that be was too much of an aristocrat â a man
who couldn't mix and get close to the work
ing people. Ladiea and gentlemen, I am a
union man. I am a member of the Sheet
Metal 'Workers' Union 279. I am on the Re
publican ticket because It Is the party to
which I belong. I am perfectly satisfied to
be on the same ticket with Henry J. Crocker.
I know unionism Is safe with Henry J. Crock
er. AH the union men like Is fair treatment
and that I kaow we will receive at . the
hands of our standard bearer. (Applause.)
As for myself â two years ago I appeared
on the platform and said If I was elected Su
pervisor I would do everything In my power
to Improve the city. I have done my share
and if re-e>ctt:d I will continue the good work.
I thank you. (Applause.)
George DIetterle, George R. Wells and
Dr. Stephen, candidates for Supervisor,
were also introduced and received a good
j reception. Their speeches were short and
; to the point. All promised if elected to
j do all in their power to give the citizens
a good administration.
Louis N. Jacobs, candidate for Record
er, was Introduced and also spoke in be-
I half of himself and the balance of the
j ticket.
Judge Bahrs came in late and enlighten
ed bis auditors on his chances for elec-
I tion to the offlce of Assessor. The Judge
; still suffered from a cold, but when he
I warmed up his voice rang out through
i the hall. He aroused a great deal of. en
j thusiasm by the manly way he talked to
I the voters. He said some people thought
| he had been handed a gold brick when
i he was nominated a few weeks ago, but
| he would prove on election day that he
was handed one of the highest gifts in
the hands of the people of this tity. He
said Dr. Dodge imagined he had a claim
to the office of Assessor and could stay
j there all his life, but he thought the vot
ers of San Francisco would show the "in
vincible" candidate that he could not hold
the office for a lifetime. The Judge said
some pertinent things about the present
Assessor, all of which was eagerly lis
tened to by the assemblage.
FITTED AS A LEADER.
Fred Bent, who is a candidate for re
election as Supervisor, was given a hearty
greeting by his neighbors. In his speech
he said:
The Republican party has at last found a
man fitted to head the ticket. If I had beÂ«n
appointed a committee of one to look for a
man to head our ticket and if I had walked
from the ferry to this distant district. I would
not have found a man better fitted for the
high honor than Henry J. Crocker. (Ap
plause.) â¢
Two years ago I remember saying on sev
eral platforms that If I was eUcted Super
visor of this city I would vote for the best
interests of the people who elected me to that
high office., I appear before you for re-elec
tion and if you eee fit to elect me to the of
fice 1 will promise to do my beet for the good
of the city. I have traveled this district from
end to end and I am acquainted with Its needs
and if elected I will do all I can for the Im
provement of the city. I am a strong believer
in unionism and if elected I will prove as I
have before that I am a stanch friend of the
union man. (Applause.)
Chairman Franech next introduced Hen
ry J. Crocker to the gathering, and the
shouts of his supporters rang through the
hall. When the plaudits had subsided he
spoke in part as follows:
I have heard more speaking to-night than it
generally falls to my lot to hear, because we
candidates are rufhlne from one part of the
city to another and we don't have a chance to
hear the various speakers, but It seems to me
that some of the gentlemen who have spoken
to-night have forgotten their own candidacy
in speaking for my own, and I want to thank
them from the bottom of my heart for the kind
words they have uttered, and I hope that all
the candidates on our ticket are elected I
wish to refer particularly to Judge Percy V
Long and Judge Edwin M. Sweeney, who are
unable to be here by reason of sickness.

CANDIDATE OP PEOPLE.
People know that I am not much of a talker,
but they know my heart is in this contest.- i
am greatly gratified In receiving the nomina
tion from my party. -People havÂ» accepted me
because I am not a candidate of one set of
men. I am a candidate of the people. My
friends In the Thirty-eighth and other districts
said they wanted me to head the ticket. They
Eaid. -Mr. Crocker is our candidate and we
don't want any other." That is how I got
my nomination, I am not the candidate of a
boss or any one- set of men. I put myself
before you as the candidate of the people of
San Francisco.
I have had the pleaeure within the last throe
days of being visited by several union men
They came to my office and stated they, did
"i? 1 k !? ow what kInd of a man ! w Â«Â«- "We
thought, said they, "you were an aristocrat;
that you were a fellow who would buy his way
Into offlce. caring nothing for the Deople but
only for the glory of It. We have watched
you and we have read and heard what you
have had to eay about the great Issues. We
have met you at our works and you have never
been feazed once. We have waited for the
opposition -to spring scmo campaign lies, to
attack your integrity and good faith, and they
have failed to do so. Therefore. Mr. Crocker,
we propose to Indorse you as our candidate for
Mayor. Thte Is the greatest â¢ compliment I
have ever received In my life. Another great
compliment to me is the knowledge that I
have a united Republican party behind me in
this contest. They say I am a candidate of
one faction cf the Republican party. This Is
untrue, as before I was nominated and after
the nomination was tendered me the members
of the party eaid If they could get a good man
to accept, the- nomination they would all get
behind the ticket, and they have done so
People of San Francisco consider that the
issues before them In this campaign are of
the gravest importance. We read In the pa
pers and learn what great appropriations are
made by the authorities at Washington for
the Improvement of our rivers and harbors and
we learn how hard our Congressmen are labor-
Ing to secure these appropriations. We know
how slow these appropriations are In coming
and the Deople of San Francisco have taken
the matter In hand and are now ready to im
prove the city. They want better sewers, bet
ter school houses. Darks and -other improve
ments, and it Is the expenditure of these vast
rums of money that make . the people of SSan
Francisco pause and think, and thÂ»y will
think deeply before they go to the. polls on
election day and deposit their votes in the
ballot-box.
NO STBINGS ON" HIM.
I can assure you without fear of contradic
tion that I cau cro Into that office without
having a single string on me. I can give you
an administration that is clean. If you elect
the entire Renubllcan ticket the administra
tion will be a harmonious one,' as the men you
will elect will support me and I Â¦ will support
them. 1 wiil support a government for the
people, a government, that you people are most
Interested In. and in appointing commission
ers I shall apnoint them because of their fit
ness lor the position to be filled. I shall do
all 'I can to {-'lease the people who elect me to
office.- I thank you for your attention.

; able addresses delivered by Henry
II J ' Crocker, the standard bearer of
the Republican party, and other speakers.
The meeting was held in the Thirty-third
Assembly District under the auspices of
the Young Men's Republican Club. The
hall was ir.adeaua.te to accommodate the
people who tried to hear the various
speakers. Enthusiasm was shown when
Henry J. Crocker arrived, and through
out his address he was heartily applauded.
State Senator Frank French presided
over the meeting. Nearly all the candi
dates on the ticket appeared before the
voters of the district and were warmly
received. Thomas Huling, president of
the club, and Frank Chambers, the sec
retary, completed the arrangements for
the meeting, which was considered the
best held in the district this campaign.
Joseph de Forrest delivered a Ehort ad
dress. He appealed to the voters to stand
by the party, as the candidates were
pledged to do all in their power to im
prove the city. He said the district need
ed many improvements and he thought
they could be secured from the Repub
lican party. He paid a high tribute to
the standard bearer, who he said was
a citizen cf high standing in this com
munity.
A. Van der Kaillen Jr. was the principal
speaker of the evening. His remark's were
addressed to the workingmen present. He
envised them not to meddle in politics and
quoted the words of prominent friends of
labor, who advised the same course. He
told of his own struggles in life; of his
friendship for the workingman and hi"
experience with them in the course of his
employment as civil engineer. He said
they had a perfect right to organize, but
he did not think it advisable for them t!>
get away from the two great political
parties. He also told of his experience as
a member of the Board of Public Works.
He said he attempted to bring about re
forms, but was cut short in his good
work. He condemned Mayor Schmitz and
paid he was a false leader. Van der Nail
len spoke with great earnestness and
many of his sentiments were applauded.
He eaid he would not tell the workingmen
to vote for Henry J. Crocker, but left it
to their better judgment. He said Mr.
Crocker was a friend of labor and had
been all his life. He denied that he was
an aristocrat and proved it by incidents
In the standard bearer's life. Mr. Van
der Nalllen also had some sharp things
to sav about Mr. Lane.
CHEERS FOB NYLAND.
Joseph S. Xyland. candidate for Super
visor, proved himself a popular man with
the residents of the district. The mention
of his name brought forth a cheer. Ny

part be said:
To know Henry J. Crocker is to love and re
apeet him. lie will make an ideal Mayor of

tion.
We. the members of the Republican party, de

strong: y in favor of* organized labor. I am
ftror.jr.y in favor of letting the worklngmar.
and mechanic cbtain the highest wages and
work as few hours as are consistent and neces
sary. It het been said by 6ome of your leaders
that by iorming political parties S" ou injure
your cause and don't advance it. In forming
political parties you antagonize ether parties.
I therefore urge you to stand by the colors of
that party that has been a true and most con
sistent friend of the laboring man â the Repub
lican party. (Applause.)
Judge Joachimson was given a good
rally when he was introduced to the
gathering. The Judge said some nice
things about Percy V. Long and his col
league, Edwin M. Sweeney, both of whom
Â¦were unable to attend the meeting. In
the course of his speech Judge Joachim
6on said:
Â¦While on the bench I tried to be Impartial,
Just and lenient. My record is before you. 'You
know how I filled the position. During the ten
years I served en the police bench there was
never a 6candal in my court. I tried to keep
it clean sind I made a court of justice of It. I
tried to protect the young and in my experi
ence I saved many young men and young wo
men and know that they are leading respect
able lives. I thank God I did so and if elected
I will continue to do so.
Dr. Thomas EL Morris, candidate for
Coroner, made a modest, straightforward
address to the voters of the district and
made an- excellent Impression. Citizens
phouted out that he was the kind of a
Coroner they desired. Dr. Morris said he
had lived in this city for the past eighteen
years. He said if he was elected Coroner
lie would preside over the inquests in a
fearless and Impartial manner and wouM
place the responsibility where It right
fully . belonged. He promised that the
dead should be treated with respect, and
Instead of tending the body to the Morgue
he would permit it to remain In the house
and toe surrounded by sorrowing friends.
lie also promised a clean administration.
DUTY OF VOTERS.
J. T. Nourse, a young Republican
orator, delivered a splendid speech to the
voters of the <iistriÂ£t. He spoke in behalf
of Percy V. Long, and also took occasion
to tell some campaign truths. In part he
said:
I believe It is the duty of every voter to
rtand by the Republican ticket this campaign.
We here eighteen men on the Supervisorial
ticket and all cannot appear before you at this
time. If we want to so ahead on the broad
lines we have started we murt have a Board of
iSujit-rvieorÂ» which will toe In harmony with the

CONCERNING
THE PLETHORA OF
PRECIOUS METAL
Since October 1. 1898. the circulation for
each person in the United States has run us
from (24 24 to $Â£Â» 75 and the part of gold in
It from $8 78 to $12 67. While nowhere else
are checks and drafts and lÂ«kÂ« Instruments
used to the same extent as with us, no other
country has so much money per capita In cir
culation save France, which claims (39 22
where Â¦ checks Â¦ are much lees used than here"
Great Britain hes (18 29 and Germany (20 4S :
Canada. $14 39; Russia has only $6 60. (See ta
ble C st the end of tKe address.) Differing
from notes of national banks, gold Is money
Possible peril lies on another side. Our cir
culation Is undergoing an Immense and contin
uous Inflation. In five years the money in cir
culation in this country has run' up from
(1,S1G,516.392 to (2.4O4.617.OU9. an Increase of
fSS8.02O.C77. The strength is that, of- this
growth (358,604.872 has been In gold, coin and
certificates, an annual addition In that form of
nearly (72,000,000. We are to confront a fur
ther Increase in our circulation, of which gold
will constitute not far from $50,000,000 a year
That precious metal, including the certificates
standing for it. Is now 42.27 of the total, and
its share advances steadily.
Cheap currency may be devised, If that
Is wanted, but it will have all the qualities of
cheapness; It will be weak, unstable, dubious.
Gold is worth all It coats. It goes masterfully
everywhere. It stands sure and steadfast It
self, and all allied to It takes on Its strength
and power. Our yellow metal passes In Kt.
Petersburg. Peking. In Hongkong and Toklo,
and the United States note and sliver certifi
cate march with it In equal favor. The Amer
ican people were urged to make flat money, be
cause ft was cheap, and to coin silver at 16 to
1, because it was cheap. They rose above the
temptation and declared not once but twice and
always that they want not cheap money, but
the best In the world. And they have it, and
the annual Inflow of $80,000,000 assures it to
them and rewards their wisdom. . .
SOME critics complain that gold is not a
cheap currency. That Is true, and It Is
Its merit: It Is sectlre beyond doubt.

. No one can deny that the golden Inflow con
tributes to the currency a share growing more
rapidly than the total circulation, all at par

activity in industry and trade, and pushes en
terprise forward, while It also tempts to undue

By. index numbers the advance of all com
modities has been from $76,803 to $97,891. or
21 points. On full examination, the Employ
ers' Association of Chicago finds that the cost
of -living in this country has increased 15 per
cent In five years. Carroll D. Wright, head of
the Bureau of Labor, with all the data of the
Anthracite Coal Commission, declares the ad
vance to be from 15 to 17 per cent. These
figures may be accepted as authoritative.
Advance in wages follows Increase in cost
of living. In recent years it has come fast
and strong. Large railway companies and
other , corporations have added IS per cent at
one step to wages paid, to meet the recog
nised advance in cost of living. The drift had
been downward in wages from 1898, to 1898;
since It has been steadily upward. In many
cases it has exceeded the rise In cost of living.
The general average may safely be stated at
from 15 to 20 per cent. Persons with fixed

This golden. flood is without peer in its mag

recorded in human annals. It has covered the
continent and blessed all the inhabitants. Its
sources and its current are not exhausted. It
continues to spread. itself over every valley and

Bankers may do much to direct It into right
and beneficent channels. They can prevent Its

clearly mapped.. .
Upon the marvelous golden Inflow American
mechanism moves in triumph. Our agriculture
is still dominant in our wheat and meats and
fruit and cotton. The remarkable growth Is in
our manufactures, now constituting nearly a
third of our exports. Â¦- predictions . and rock
tflbbed are our material and financial condi
tions.. Predictions can prudently be based upon
them. But the minds of men are a' shoreless
tnd chartless ses. snd no one can tell when
Dr why pallid fear may brood horribly upon its
waves. The nerves of the multitude are a vast
electric system which some accident may start
into sparks or even flame and shock and far
reaching utterances. Into this mystic region
our theme does not lead us, even if we had
the courage to enter there. We have been
studying what can be weighed and measured.
But we invade the Old World with our
manufactures by reason of the skill and en
ergy of American labor and the methods de
vised by American'gcnlus. We run electric
roads besides the Pyramids; we furnish har
vesters for Russia: we build bridges In the
Boudan and in Burmah; send locomotives - to
farthest Manchuria; help Germany to Â¦ load
coal; sell shoes to Austria; scatter sewing ma
chines everywhere, and our watches keep time
on the Danube, the Nile and the Orinoco Our
high wages have not yet checked our invasion
of the markets of Europe and Asia. Increas
ing home consumption affects to some degree
the exports of our merchandise, for we ship
only what our own people do not use but
the more we make the more we shall sell.
The exports of our manufactures for the
eight months ending with last August were
$278,619,872, and 82.4 per cent of our total ex
ports; for the like period of the preceding year
they were $279,632,&92 and 84.79 per cent in all

Howell Cobb. Secretary of the Treasury, pro

engendered schemes of Improvident speculation,
leading to rapid fluctuations in prices and hab
its of extravagance the principal cause for the
embarrassments in the commerce of the coun

by the act of March 8,f 1657. reducing rates by
20 per cent. Looking - back the student tnay
ask, was not the shadow of the Civil War a
contributing cause? It is certain that all
branches of business were prostrated and that
the distress was wide and intense. The banks
suapended. but the Government kept on paying
coin. While paralysis fell upon enterprise, the
country was not exhausted as In the panic of

To-day the contrasts with that period are
many more than the parallels. No sectional
strife disturbs the national serenity. Our huge
railroad system binds all States together, and
connects ocean with ocean and. the gulf with
the great lakes. Our industries are more va
ried and so havs a broader base. Enterprise
takes more extensive range. They- cannot be
so easily toppled over. From 1S90 to 1900 the
annual product of our manufactures grew from
0,372,437.283 to (18.039,279.566. Our imports
of merchandise ran up from (789.310,409 to

business has been expanded in some directions
in an unparalleled degree. Credit has natu
rally been multiplied at least to four times the
amount of cash added to our supply. The ex

ran on at a dangerous speed, fortunately to
exhaust Itself byÂ» its own excesses. , Promotion
of stocks and bonds is not industry; It is spec

inflation. In that way the Inflow of gold has
magnified if not wholly caused tUe frenzy and
the excesses in industrial securities. Those
who have climbed too high Into the realm of
credit must come down, and here the descent,
unlike that to Avernus, is not smooth and
pleasant. The promoter who has failed to dis
tribute his stocks and bonds may be punished,
and those who have petted his schemes may
suffer. But a shrinking of Inflated securities
to their true value Is not a public calamity. In.
divlduals may be crippled, Industry and en

ing- that the quantity of cash necessary is one
thlrd of the. rents to the proprietors, or one
ninth of the product of the lands. This really
only names other unfixed quantities as thÂ«
standard. ; We have passed far beyond such
limit. The theory has been proclaimed that
the circulating medium should keep exact pace
with the â¢ population. Conditions vary in dif
ferent countries and at different periods. In
the same land at periods not remote from each
other large, additions to the currency cannot
fall to affect enterprise. Industry and com
merce, the cost of living and the prices of com
modltles. But the currency is only one factor
bearing on production, and consumption. We
shall err radically if we treat it as the absolute
dictator.-. T - t- *-*. <Â¦â¢ â¢ . .
An able address on* the "Education of
Bank Clerks" was then presented by J.
Emergency circulation could, within careful
limitations, be safely permitted upon th* actual
deposit with the Treasury Department of se
curities acceptable to the Secretary of the
Treasury, and upon such deposits circulation
could be issued promptly to meet actual em
ergencies, which would not be possible if time
were taken for the examination of general
assets by the Secretary of the Treasury and
Comptroller of the Currency. A tax of 6 p Â« r
cent per annum should be imposed upon such
emergency circulation to insure and hastes its
return to the issuing bank, thu tax to be set
aside as a safety fund to secure the United
States ' Treasury for the redemption of notes
so issued. This emergency circulation should
be issued without any distinguishing mark
from. other national bank circulation except to
substitute the word* "secured -by bonds ap
proved by the Secretary of the Treasury â¢â¢ in
stead of thÂ« words "bonds of. the- United
States." for being amply secured there should
be no discrimination against it beyond â¢ the Â«
per Â¦ cent tax.-
To farther liberalise the circulation your
committee recommends that the United State-.
tax on circulation should be uniform on the
issue of currency based on all classes of United
States Government bonds.
* In the ODlnlon of your committee the most
serious need la the reform of the sub-treasury
system in such wiÂ«e that the money with
drawn from the banks for custom duties as
well as Internal revenues shall be deposited in
the banks and thus be made available for use
In the community from which it has been
withdrawn. Such a reform could be inaugu
rated by giving to the Secretary of the Treas
ury discretionary authority to permit deposits
to the extent of 60 per cent of the capital and
surplus of national banks of customs receipts
as well as internal revenue receipts guaran
teed by securities aceeotable to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Such an arrangement would
render impossible the embarrassment* which
have frequently occurred aa the result of treas
ury accumulations.
Regarding the question of circulation, the
first and mest imDortant requirement Is the
Immediate repeal of the prwent limitations of
$3,000,000 per month upon the withdrawal of
circulation, so that the expansion and contrac
tion will be automatic and governed by the
surrounding situations. Under the present re
strictions many banks are unwilling to Issue
currency for temporary and legitimate needs
which they would issue if they felt certain that
their currency could be retired when no longer
needed. .
The Important portion of the report of
tho currency, committee Indorsed yester
day in the adoption of the resolution
brought forward by Congressman Pugsley
was as follows:
â¢ The currency committee, composed of men
eminently Qualified to deal with this Intricate
problem, and representing different sections of
our. great country, after much discussion and
consideration have presented a valuable and
conservative report, without a single radical
feature in it. It may be said that there is
nothing new in the report, but this question
has been discussed for years by bankers In
convention, by representatives in Congress and
by the press. The discussions have taken a
. wide range, embracing almost every feature ol
the currency question. Some have favored
more currency; others have held as tenaciously
to the position that there was money enough
for all practical purposes. We have had sug
gestions as to emergency circulation, supple
mentary circulation, elastic currency and cur
rency issued by clearing-houses and numerous
other devices and suggestions as to the rate of
tax to be applied to such currency and whether
it should be issued freely at the option of the
banks or under the authority and direction
of the Controller of the Currency. There is
no doubt that our system can be improved, but
I do not believe it will be revolutionized. 11
Is essential that Us volume should rise and
fall with the varying tides of 'business and
commerce. It is the most Important measure
before this convention. It la Important be
cause It reaches and should interest all sec
tions of our republic. A sound and stable
currency is the life blood of the nation's com
merce and prosperity and It is of vital import
not only to the banking and commercial In
terests but to the people of the whole country
that our currency should be sound beyond
question and good beyond peradventure. The
great essential of any currency is quality
rather than quantity, and * I am glad to say
that the bankers and citizens of California
have ever stood for quality and that they also
have evidently been successful In obtaining
quantity.
"Wherever our flag waves, from the islands
of the Atlantic to the distant islands of the
Pacific, and from the sunny south to Alaska
With its eternal snows, we should have the
best currency that the brains and skill of
America can evolve. We want to see the
world's standard the American dollar and out
currency system surpass that of any other
nation on the face of the globe, but only by
the most conservative legislation can this be
accomplished. In the broadest sense it is a
national question. What la of the greatest
value to thÂ« people should be . the aim of
bankers and all legislation, and not what
should be of the greatest value and assistance
to the banks. The banks are the servants of
the people, not the masters. The people are
keenly Interested in this question, and not only
Is it being considered and dlscusaad by the
President of the United States, by Represen
tatives In Congress, by the press, by bankers,
but by the people at large. I do not believe
that the bankers of this country for selflbh
Interests and purposes will do aught to re
tard tho general prosperity of the country.
On more titan one occasion they have jhown
themselves patriots and I believe they will
urge and favor only such legislation aa will
result for the countigr*s good. : '
I have been . instructed by the executive
council to present this resolution:
"Resolved, That the resort of the currency
committee appointed under resolution passej
at the last annual convention of the American
Bankers' Association held at New Orleans be
adopted, and that the president of this asso
ciation : appoint a. committee of three forvthe
purpose of urging legislation along the lines
recommended in the report.

throw suspicion on employes having access
thereto. In August. 19C0. a member . was de

made on two members in .Newark, N. J., wher*
the presenter was arrested and later sect to
the penitentiary- In December, 1901. two more
banks, members, were defrauded In New Tori*
City. but. although a careful Investigation di
rected suspicion toward Brush, no evidence
could be had until the fall of 1902, when he
resumed operations cii a broader scale, with
George Roas as micMlemaiTand Alfred Hearst
and Alexander :5tone as rresenters of his forged
Checks. So careful was Brush, however, that
several banks were operated upon before the>
evidence would warrant his arrest, which was
accomplished December 20. followed by the.
apprehension of his helper*. George Ross gave
evidence for the State, and the other n;s
pleaded guilty. In consideration of his ad

Hearst received* a similar sentence and Alex

September 15. 1902, to September 15, 1003. of
H5 forgers and swindlers, sixty-five of whom
have been arrested. Twenty-one of these have

The detective agents Â«f the association wen
prepared to cennert him with a series of swin

and was sentenced to the penitentiary for a
term of four years.

since the fall of 1S04. It has fully justified
itself in every particular save that of sur

criminals, have become Important in the past
few years. 'The operations against thesÂ« ere

Treasurer Roberts, and that was that the
United States Is enjoying prosperity never
known before in -the history of any na
tion; that this country exceeds as* other
great power In its wealth and products,
and that the shrinkage of securities In
the last two years has not affected the
stability of the country, the surest proof
of its soundness and financial strength.
The figures quoted were of such magni

figures of wealth, they were easily under
standable.

ends. He compared the Treasury accounts

products of the United States and com
pared them with the similar products of
the countries mentioned.
the distinguished flnaacier spoke on "The

Without notes and relying absolutely on
hJs memory. Treasurer .Roberts presented
an amazing array of figures. In which hÂ«
compared the wealth and business of the
United States with tha.t of Great Britain
and other European countries.
The address of Treasurer Roberts was
frequently Interspersed with applause,
especially when he referred to the mag
rltude of the wealth of tins nation and
the enormous growth of Its manufac

ever delivered at any convention of the

denies that it owes bondholders or
has made any default," either of taxes or
interest. It is stated Uiat there are sixty
eight bonds .outstanding. Three others
were Issued, but have , since been paid.
It- is pointed out that if the advertise
ment of sale, continues it will tend to
cast a cloud on the title of, the property,
subject the company to annoying litiga

remedy. "For these reasons the injunc

of which the company planned to com

is claimed that default has been made

EUREKA. Oct. 23.â Mrs. E. D. Porter,
wife of the manager of trie lumber yard
at Newburgr, and daughter or E. J. Dodge
of Alameda, president of the, company. Is
a heroine In the lumber settlement In
and about Fortuna. By her remarkable
presence of mind and bravery she averted
a collision between three runaway lumber
cars, heavily loaded, and an engine.
Three loaded lumber cars standing In
the yards at Newbur^ suddenly started' to
roll down the gTa^e leafllng- to the point
of conjunction with the San Francisco
and Northwestern tracks. Their velocity
after traveling some distance became ter
rific. A short distance txhead of the cars
and in the pathway of the runaways stood
the engine. Yard Boss Nelson, taking in
the perilous situation, signaled to the en
gineer, who instantly opened wide the
throttle and the engine started down the
track pursued by the three rapidly mov
ing cars. The lumber yard at the op
posite end of the track was notified by
telephone. Mrs. Porter was in the office,

tendered to them by the bankers
of San FYanclsco. It was a great
success In every particular and each
act was loudly applauded by an
immense audience of more than 3000 peo
ple. William Greer Harrison had full
charge of the different events.
The programme was varied and of a
highly interesting and instructive char
acter, i
For the first time In the annals of
athletics the fair sex witnessed boxing
bouts that were In earnest. The men who
fought before the assembled bankers an."
the fair sex battled for trophies and the
ladles enjoyed the heavy going. Gore
was spilled and hard punches were ex
changed. It was a novel sight for the
ladles to see the men come Into the ring
and be attended by their seconds: to
listen to the gong sound and to watch
the reTeree separate the men in the
clinches. The climax was reached when
Joe Collins; the clever Olympic Club light
weight, dropped ''Nobby" Otts for the
count on two occasions. Ott3 was knocked
out and the ladies hissed Collins for what
they thought was brutality.
John J. Gleason brought on the wres
tlers first and the exciting matches were
highly appreciated.
William Larkin secured two straight
falls from G. "\V. Freeman. A. A. Pnclt
witz defeated C. D. Penthony, champion
of the coast, in quick fashion. Pockwitz's
showing created a sensation. Emil
Tschumi proved too strong and clever
for G. H. Williams, whom he defeated in
two straight falls! C. B. Beardon had a
hard time pinning F. M. Vecki's shoulders
to the pad, but he did so after strenuous
work. All the wrestlers were pupils of
George S. Miehling. wrestling instructor
of the Olympic Club. H. Smith was
referee.
DeWitt Van Court assisted John J.
Gleason In bringing off the four-round
bouts. Al Lean handled the men and
sent the club representatives into the
arena In perfect shape. Eadie Mervin
Graney Â¦was referee and Sam Berger and
William Cartwright were the Judges.
Fred Butz was timekeeper.
Lew Powell made a monkey of*. I.
Hughes in their four-round bout and
earned the decision. Joe Collins knocked
out "Nobby" Otts in the second round.
JoÂ« Kano secured a decision over Dick
Cullen after four rounds of fast boxing.
Joe Carroll, the featherweight champion
of the coast, was all over J. Tenney in
their battle, winning easily.
The aauatic part of the entertainment
also came in for a. treat deal of praise.
Sundbors won the 100-yard handicap
swimming tost for the Lurline Club, and
Alex Pape carried off the honors for tho
same trial for the Olympic Club. Profes-

We promise that the aggregation of such reports
will show a state of facts that will rouse the fruit
growers from one end of the State to the other.
The inquiry of the board will not be confined to the
local nor the American market. Our fruit in all forms
goes to far London and is yearly extending its range
in continental Europe. Recently the possibility of
exporting fresh fruit to Asia has been demonstrated.
Fresh fruit has been shipped from Santa Clara to
Manila, being five weeks in transit, with incomplete
coM storage, and arrived in good condition with less
than the usual percentage of loss. While the Manila
market may not be able to absorb large quantities
the prices are # high for what it does take.
The best lesson of this experimental shipment is in
its proof of the keeping and shipping qualities of our
fresh fruit. If it will bear that long voyage into the
tropics the horizon of our fruit growers is indefinitely
enlarged. It is "a great, growing and permanent in
'erest, justifying the prophecy of Horace Greeley that
California's future is in her capacity as a producer of
.-- jrreatcr variety of fruits than any other part of the
cr.rth. Let our fruit growers bestir themselves in
"jchalf of the Board of Trade inquiry and let them
âmember that they are something more than grow
-Â« of the best fruit in the world, for they are inter
tie and international merchants, with an interest in
cry market in the world in which any form of their
Â¦oduct finds a consumer.
THE inquiry instituted by the State Board of
Trade into the marketing of California fruit
is timely, for our fruit is seeking a wider and
more distant market and the profits of this extension
should conic back to the planter. We have no doubt
that if the proper returns of sales to the consumer
. ome back to the producer it will appear that fruit
grdtifing in California is the most profitable of rural
industries. The policy heretofore has been to permit
just enough of the price, willingly paid by the con
sumer, to trickle into the hand of the producer to
keep him producing.
Of course there arc hundreds of fruit growers in
this State who have prospered exceedingly and whose
condition Should be typical of all orchard and vine
yard planters in California. But these arc men who
join to horticultural skill a high commercial faculty;
they arc business men as well as producers. They
knou the wily svays of the predatory middlemen and
transact their own business and get the full value of
their product. The Call desires that every fruit
grower shall be as prosperous as these, who should
be types of the entire industry, and can see no road to
that realization except the one marked out by the
State Board of Trade. The producers should inter
est themselves in what the board proposes in their
behalf. They should supply it with facts and inci
dents. Each man who has been deprived of proper
return on his shipments has a keen recollection of the
event and should confide it to the board. Out of
several of such cases the board can frame a general
circular of inquiry, the blanks on which can be filled
by the frrit growers.

MASTERLY INACTIVITY â B. L..
Jamestown, Cal. The words "masterly
inactivity" were first applied- to McClel
lan's policy when in command of .an army
during the fall of 1561 and the spring of
1862. The weather at the time seemed fa
vorable to a campaign and "Little Mac's"
army was in excellent condition, yet no
advance was undertaken. His policy was
then spoken of as a policy of masterly
inactivity.
A CONFERENCE recently took place in Sac
ramento' between the official representatives
of the Sacramento Valley Development Asso
ciation and delegates from the Federation of Women's
Clubs of the Sacramento Valley. The purpose was.
to discuss the improvement and beautifying of the
towns and cities in the. Sacramento Valley. There
were 350 persons in attendance. The Sacramento
Union, reviewing the proceedings, says that "as an
assembly for consultation and exchange of views
prefatory to decisive action expected to be taken be
fore the next meeting in January the gathering was
a pronounced success. The belief was entertained all
around that the gathering has set in motion agencies
which will be fruitful of much good."
Men whose names are familiar in California when
ever any plan for the betterment of the State is
under consideration were speakers at the conference.
'The noteworthy fact, however, was the large partici
pation of women. Among the women delegates who
spoke* were Mrs. William Bcckman of Sacramento:
Mrs. W. S. Green, president of the Valley Federated
Clubs; Mrs. A. A. Goddard, president of the Tuesday
Club; Mrs. A. J. Johnston and Mrs. Dr. Wright of
Sacramento; Mrs. Groves, president of the Town Im
provement Club of Redding, and Mrs. Albert Elkus,
president of the Saturday Club of Sacramento.
â¢ The remarks of the ladies are reported in substance
by the Union. From this account it is made plain
that they entertain practical, shrewd ideas that can
not fail to assist in the advance of the imperial valley
in which they dwell. How to beautiful the towns,
cities, villages, rural homes and country sections of
the Sacramento Valley as a means of making the val
ley more attractive and inviting to desirable immi
grants and to improve local conditions in such man
ner" as,.to stimulate the people to improve the advan
tages that nature has bestowed was the keynote of
their remarks.
Mrs. William Beckman would have better roads in
the valley, such as she has seen in Europe. Homes
should be made beautiful. The adornment of French
villages and hamlets, towns and .cities furnished ex
amples that California might follow with profit. Mrs.
Beckman said that the locations of schoolhouses
should be carefully selected to give them picturesque
surroundings. Parks, playgrounds "and the cultiva
tion of flowers she found to be factors that would
make Sacramento Valley attractive to new comers.
Mrs. A. J. Johnston and Mrs. Albert Elkus spoke
concerning methods of obtaining concerted action.
Mrs. Johnston said that it would be well to follow the
lead of the Women's Councils in the East, which em
brace all clubs of women. Together they are potent
in instituting improvements, which may be guided by
counsel and advice and promoted by good, hard work.
Mrs/ Dr. Wright desired to have existing and other
clubs to be- formed in Sacramento work for the im
provement of the section of Sacramento below Sixth
street, while Mrs. W. S. Green maintained that the
women's clubs of Sacramento could largely assist' in
the improvement of the entire Sacramento Valley.
Mrs. Groves of Redding, from the far end of the
valley, reported that the Woman's Town Improve
ment Club in that city, has succeeded in having the
grounds surrounding the new Carnegie library de
clared to Be a park. The club is improving and beau
tifying this park.
Mrs. Albert Elkus promised co-operation on the
part of the Saturday Club. Mrs. A. A. Goddard said
that while the Tuesday Club of Sacramento is purely
a literary organization she had no doubt it would use
its influence to aid in the improvement of the com
munities of the Sacramento Valley. Definite plans
will possibly be reported in January. In the delibera
tions then to take place doubtless the women. of the
Sacramento Valley will be prominent and helpful.

trade to-morrow) will say:
-Numerous labor controversies have ap
peared and more "furnaces and mills have
closed, the tendency being to operate only
the plants provided with the most modern
equipment. There is no anxiety regarding
legislation at the special session of Con
gress, and' despite the curtailment of ac
tivity in many manufacturing lines a
heavy volume of business is being
transacted. Western traffic facilities are
proving inadequate, the distribution of
merchandise being enormous at the inte
rior, and taking- the country as a whole
conditions may be considered fairly satis

evidences that an abnormal activity has
received a check. The jobbing trade has
become quiet with the advancing prices,
and at many points the weather Is not
colculated to maintain the buying of
wearing apparel at retail.
, The gross earnings of the railways thus
far reported for October exceed last year's
by 6.2 per cent. Another general reduc
tion in quotations of pig iron has occurred
notwithstanding the restriction of the out
put, and a movement Is on foot to further
reduce production unless business im

NEW YORK, Oct. 23.-Bradstreet's to
morrow will say:
The week's developments have favored
an increase in the conservatism which has
ruled in many lines for some time. Buy
ing Is not confident, and smaller quanti
ties are taken than a year ago at this
time. Good reports combine to give an
appearance of Irregularity to the trade as
a whole. Railroad gross earnings are
more moderate than earlier in the year.
Season shutdowns of outside work on

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
A quite artistic little affair was the
Bemberg "Ballade du Desespere." the
chief feature of the musical and dramatic
matinee given yesterday afternoon at the
Alcazar. The "Ballade" was given with/
the complete scenic settings by Miss FIot
ence Roberts as the poet (reader), â¢ Mrs.
Birmingham as the singer. Wenzel Kop
ta, Theodore Mansfeldt and Miss Moroney"
in /he violin, "cello and piano parts, re
spectively. So given, this Bemberg set
ting of the Henri Murger poem is new
here, and proved charmingly effective.
One vital mistakeâ in the placing of the
numberâ was made, its coming at thÂ«
close, when the invisible "voice" was
identified with Mrs. Birmingham, in a re
markably fetching pink gown, the piano
with the statuesque Moroney and the fid
dle and 'cello with their two players. This
all mattered. Murger's poem, is arranged
as a duet between a speaking voice (poet)
and a' singing voice â variously, fame, love,
wealth, death, etc.â that is heard at'h!*
garret door. The conflict of picture Is
obvious. Miss 1 Roberts charmed as the
poet, and Mrs. Birmingham made a much
prettier death to die than Mr. Crawley's
well remembered "Everyman." It was a
decidedly taking tableau at the close,
where the gray and white ; robed Angel
of Death bent over the dead poet. The
whole performance was smooth and suf
ficient, showing evidence of thorough and
thoughtful rerftarsal. "
The first half of the programme was
given over to some songs by Mrs. Bir
mingham and some delightful fiddling by
Wenzel Kopta. Mr. Kopta might not
have been in quite his best form at the
beginning of his group, but later warm
ed up to his usual fiery eloquence. The
Dvorak "Slavic Dance," with its plain
tive merry-making, was played with deli
cate romanticism, artd the "Air Hongrols"
of Ernst showed Mr. Kopta in brilliant
mood. The Konstkl "Cascade"â that al
ways rcjninds of a passing trainâ capped
his performance, however. It is great
fun, and gorgeously done by Mr. Kopta.
* Mrs. Birmingham's chief songs in her
ten well-chosen numbers wero the lovely
"Tschaikowsky Nur wer die Schnsucht
Kennt," with 'cello obligator two beauti
ful Gluck and Pergdlesi numbers, the
Strauss "Traum Durch die Dammerung"
and the exquisite "Geheimes" of Schu
bert. Mrs. Birmingham was In good voice
and mood. Miss Moroney competently ac
companied. _ . >> -
LONDON PAPERSâSubscriber. City.
The regular London dallies do not print
a Sunday edition. There are special Sun
day papers in that city.
, No man can tell how much of the spirit of Democ
racy is left in the party that still claims the name, but
to the extent that it exists it has no sympathy with
Mr. Lane and he no claim upon its support. There
is another element in his campaign that causes Demo
cratic solicitude. Confessedly it is collateral to Mr.
Hearst's organization to secure the Democratic nomi
nation to the Presidency. This is shown in the Ex
aminer's support of Lane. Heretofore they have been
in personal antagonism though in strict political af
finity. The}' both belong to the new school of De
mocracy, which stands for Government substitution
of all personal energy and enterprise. The working
plan of Mr. Hearst's Democracy would mean a nation
hybrid between Gronlund's co-operative republic and
Bellamy's dream of a lazy man's paradise. To the
virile Democracy of Jefferson such a scheme is intol
erable. The free man created by the doctrine of Jef
ferson would either commit suicide to escape the
Bellamyite system of Lane and Hearst or he would
put his energy into a revolution to make of Govern
ment a scheme for red-blooded men to live under in
stead of a machine in which men are mere cogs in a
wheel.
It is legitimate politics to appeal to genuine* Demo
crats to begin now the discouragement of the politics
of Lane and Hearst by refusing to support a ticket
which represents such a stew of undemocratic ideas
and policies. Mr. Lane has no claim upon their
votes, as they have no wish to help create the iri
descent revery which he calls government.
MR. LANE depends upon getting the Demo-,
cratic vote of the city, which is a # minority,
and hopes to add to it enough Republican
votes to make him Mayor. On no ground is he en
titled to Republican votes. The Republican party
has not controlled the government of this city for
many years, yet it is in the majority here. -All of the.
tales told about corruption and misgovernment im
mediately before the adoption of the new chapter and
since it became the fundamental law of . the* city
originate in public administrations of a mixed char
acter'or wholly controlled by anti-Republican combi
nations. Republicans are now ambitious to assume
whole control and undivided responsibility and Mr.'
Lane has no claim on their votes.
But has he anyjbetter claim on the votes of the real
Democrats? The r - declination of Mr. Crittenden
Thornton seems to have answered that question. The
Democracy represented by him and by gentlemen
like Mr. Cresweil and all of the old and straight party
men is not the Democracy of Mr. Lane. He be
longs to the neocracy of the party, to its recent and I
pin-feathered socialistic school, which stands for dif
fusion of the powers of government and their enlist
ment in such a diversity of enterprises as to dilute
their force, which should be concentrated and applied
to the political objects of government only.
Mr. Lane condemns his own school when he points
out the infinitude of ways in which the new charter
invades individual liberty, to impair it or coerce it j
or blackmail it into submission to official bossism.
As he claims fatherhood of the charter and takes that
view of its possibilities as an instrument of oppression,
he can find no fault if his kind of Democracy is judged
by its creation of the charter, which he impeaches of
such potency for evil. Clearly he belongs to a politi
cal school that is neither Republican nor Democratic,
but must be classed with socialism and communism.
The old Democracy was a conservative party. Its
long lease of porter in this country was due to its
stern defense , of sound finance and personal liberty.
Its purpose was to inculcate such a degree of inde
pendence and such a high' sense of the necessity of
public order and such respect for the law that but
little was left for the Government to do. Where
man governs himself the most he needs government
from any other source the least But Mr. Lane's
school weakens that spirit of personal independence
and righteous self-government and puts public au
thority and government agency in their place. f His
idea of government is that its hand shall be in all
personal affairs and its "thou shalt" and "thou shalt
not" shall be inscribed on the lintel of every man's
door. His intense egomania is present in all of his
speeches and runs to a declaration of his belief that
he is sent to lead men out of their individuality and
into the level paradise of socialism. His idea of De
mocracy has no more resemblance to the Jeffcrsonian
idea than a can of garbage has to a ragout.
Let any Democrat take the idea of Democracy ad
vocated by Mr. Lane and project it upon the great
screen of national politics and then trace in it, if he
can. any likeness to the ideas of Jefferson. He will
find that it means a greater New Zealand, where
government is in charge of everything and a majority
of the people are salaried public employes and only
two or three occupations are left open to private en
terprise. Projecting the scheme still-further he will
see in a few generations. the people deprived of per
sonal initiative, lost to all sense of personal responsi
bility and individual independence, weakened beyond
the possibility of caring for themselves and looking
to the Government to feed and care for them and
pension them in old age. Mr. Jefferson scorned the
theory that the Government should take care of the
people and to it opposed the sturdy and manly dec
laration that the people should take care of the Gov
ernment.
LANE AND DEMOCRACY.
QUITE ARTISTIC
AFFAIR IS GIVEN
AT THE ALCAZAR
SOME ANSWERS
TO QUERIES BY
CALL READERS
CONSERVATISM
OF THE BUYERS
IS INCREASING
Grand Army of the Republic has met twice. in this
city. This is mentioned particularly because it em
bodies a point that is well worth considering.
The Grand Army men have felt the advance of age
keenly in the last sixteen years. Nevertheless, older,
iewcr, feebler in body than when they first gathered
at the Golden Gate, they were glad to make the sec
ond pilgrimage across the continent to enjoy the de
lights of this city, while engaging in their annual de
liberations. Many other large national organizations
have met here since the Knights Templar in 1883 led
the way.
The people of San^ Francisco and Los Angeles, like
the shrewd observer of the Paso Roble3 Record, have
learned to estimate the real value that underlies great
conventions and assemblages. Paso Robles will cer
tainly profit by growth stimulated by knowledge.
San Francisco and Los Angeles, that are the conven
tion cities of the State by reason of having the facili
ties for entertaining large number's of visitors, have
.both grown in the past few years with, exceptional
speed. This is cause and effect exemplified.
The Grand Army returned, the Knights Templar
have decided to come again. This will be the "com
mon experience to be duplicated in many other in
stances. The Paso Robles Record speaks axiomati
cally when it says, "A lasting gain* will accrue; the
gue$ts went away well pressed." '
The whole matter is epitomized herein. Please the
people and they will conie again. Paso Robles has
succeeded in this, therefore she will be benefited be
yond doubt in the future. .The seed has been sown;
the harvest will be reaped later.
THE SAN FKAKCISCO CALL, SATUKDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1903.
The convention of the American Bankers' Asso
ciation in this city has afforded a conspicuous oppor
tunity for a comparison in newspaper work. Eleven
years ago the same association met in San Francisco
and its proceedings were given by the papers a daily
report of a column or two) a mere skeleton of
events. Now. the proceedings hive been given
more pages 'than they were- then given columns,
and to this have been added illustrations worthy of
magazines and discussions as accurate as if by ex-,
pcrts on finance
ATTENTION is editorially called by the Paso
Roblcs Record to the advantages which have
arisen locally by reason of holding the Grand
Encampment of Odd Fellows in Paso Robles. "A
lasting gain," declares the Record sagaciously, "will
accrue to this community from the large assemblage.
The guests went away well pleased with their visit.
One visitor from Alameda said, 'They told me that a
big hotel is all there is to Paso Robles, but I find you
have a nice town here.' That a resident of many years
in Alameda should not know of this place speaks
poorly of the advertising system of Paso Robles, but
the Alameda citizen knows Paso Robles now â speaks
favorably of the placeâ and hundreds of others from
all parts of California are likewise x well acquainted
with the town."
This is all true. The lesson that Paso Robles has
learned practically is the one that has become known
to San Francisco and to Los Angeles especially in the
larger way on the basis of national conventions. Both
San Francisco and Los Angeles have become noted
convention cities. The Grand Encampment of the
If Canadian excitement -over the Alaskan boundary
decision continues we may expect to see the whole
of British Columbia nervously prostrated, a most
lamentable prospect . to contemplate. Our northern
neighbors seem to think now, so tinged are their
thoughts with sarcasm, that while they won the case
they lost their territory, and in consistency should
seek annexation to the United. States. They should
reflect that Uncle- Sam. does not take kindly to sulk
ing children who have so long enjoyed the good
things of life that, justly or not, they demand them.
Enjoins Bank Officials/
Judge Murasky Issued ' an Injunction
yesterday preventing the officials of the
International Bank arid Trust" Company,
which was recently taken in hand by lilt.
Bank : Commissioners, from continuing

complaint of Attorney . General Webb,
who sued .on request of the commissioners.
GAINS PROM CONVENTIONS
The Federal courts have decided that it is no
crime to attempt to counterfeit the coin of the nation
nor to seek to cheat the laws against smuggling.
Somebody with Spartan ideas of right and wrong
must have had much to do with. the framing of our
national penal laws. If getting caught only is an
offense we will have to make some radical modifica
tions in our code of good and evil.
San Jose has awakened to her splendid possibilities
and is vigorously bidding for tourist patronage. The
Garden City, now on the main continental line, will
.-oon possess another tremendous advantage in com
mon with every town between her and San Francisco.
The bay shore route of the Southern Pacific will
bring the farthest of these pretty towns as near to us
aÂ« Oakland and the railroad people will probably rec
ognize the wisdom of a train schedule as fair as that
now in force to the bay towns.

The Right Hon. William Edward Hart
pole Leckey was born at Newtown Park,
near Dublln> March 26. 1838. He was edu
cated at Trinity College. Dublin, taking
the degree of bachelor of arts in 1S59 and
that of master of arts in 1S63.
Following his natural bent he devoted
himself to literature and soon gained dis
tinction as an author. In 1S61, while at
tending Trinity, he published anonymous
ly "The Leaders cf Public Opinion in Ire
land.", which was republished under his
own name In 1S72. "The History of the
Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Ration
alism in Europe," a remarkable produc
tion for so young a man, followed In 1865
and had gone to the fifth edition in 1872.
Then cajne in 1869 "History of European
Morals From Augustus to Charlemagne."
These three works may be said to have
assured his place among writers if he
had never written anything- more.
In IS7S he published volumes I and II
of his "History of England in the Eight
eenth Century." followed in 1HS.2 by vol
umes III and IV. in 1SS7 by volumes V
and VI, and by volumes VII and VIII
completing the work In 1S30.
In 1891 he published a small volume of
poems, and in 1S9S an important work' on
contemporary politics called "Democracy
and Liberty," a second edition of. which,
with some additions, was published in
1SS9 and created some stir on account of
its adverse comments on Gladstone.
Leckey's writings have gone through
many editions in England and his first
three works as well as his "History of
England" have been translated into Ger
man.
In recognition of his merits as thinker
and writer lackey received a number
of honorary degrees from the great uni
versitiesâ LL. D. from his own university
of Dublin and also from the universities
of Glasgow and St. Andrews; D. C. I*
from Oxford, and, the degree of Litt. D.
from the University of Cambridge. In
1S94 he was elected a corresponding mem
ber of the Institute of France. He was
also made an honorary member of the
Royal Academy.
Leckey took much interest In the po
litical affairs of his day, choosing the
Liberal party, but not until 1S?5 was he
brought into public service. In that year
he was elected a member of Parliament
for the University of Dublin and at once
became a prominent figure in the debates
of the House. In 1S97 he was made Privy
Councillor. In 1836, on the division of
Liberals he became an active^ member of
the Unionist party.
Leckey was married in 1871 to Elizabeth,
Baroness de Dedem.

The synod resolved to hold its next
meeting in the Westminster Presbyterian
Church of Sacramento.
The report of the permanent committee
on theological seminary stated that the
outlook for the seminary was more hope
ful and cheering than for a number of
previous years. Emphasis was placed on
the services of Professor Gllchrist and
the Rev. Dr. Mclntosh.
A plan for student practice in San
Francisco and about the bay in pastoral
and evangelistic method had been formu
lated, It was stated, and its prosecution
had actually begun.
The report went on to state that there
had been a gratifying increase in the
number of students over last year. The
board of directors expressed its thanks to
the synod of Washington for the renewal
of Its contribution of $1000 toward the sup
port of the Greek chair; to A. W. Fester
for his contribution toward the support
of the assistant to Dr. Alexander 1:: the
chair of church history, end to all others
who had generously contributed this year
to the general fund.
It was urged that earnest and wise
search be pursued among the young men
of the church, for those >vho may be look
ing toward the ministry as a calling.
The recommendations of the report
were adopted with the exception of a
suggestion that after the adjournment of
the synod the board of directors shall
elect from among the faculty a chairman
of the faculty, whose title shall be
"President of the San Francisco Theolog
ical Seminary." ThÂ»i recommendation was
objected to by one vote.
Rev. Jame3 Curry, D. D., was chosen
president of tlfe Presbyterian Historical
Society; the Rev. T. F. Uurnham, M. A.,
secretary >ind treasurer, and Professor
T. F. Day, D. D., curator.
The synod expressed its sincere thanks
to the Rev. William Spear, D. D.. for his
offer to donate his library -o the synod.
The Historical Society announced that It
has In its charge the first communion set
used by the First Presbyterian Church of
San Francisco, and the hJstory of several
churches. The Rev. Dr. J. S. McDonald
presented the society with a copy of his
Synodical History.- ,
Rev. Arthur Hicks submitted a report
entitled "Sywodical Sabbath-school Mis
sionary," which set forth that durlns the
year four missionaries had been continu
ously at work in the synod, having trav
eled, in the aggregate, 2S.O0O miles. This
had been accomplished by railway, by
stage coach. In private conveyance, on
horseback and on foot.
The reverend gentlemen and laymen at
tending' the synod, taken with surprise,
arose and clapped their hands as tho or
phans were escorted to the platform,
where they gave many evidences of their,
spiritual training.
The morning and afternoon was devoted
to the hearing of numerous reports. The i
Rev. Moses- Bercovitz delivered an ad
dress, his subject being "To the Jew
First." He was followed by the Rev. W.
G. Tower, who reported from the commit
tee on publication and Sabbath-school
work. i
Headed by Mrs. P. D. Brown, the boys
and girls broke in on the staid and busi
ness-like deliberations of t.ie synod and

One of the most impressive incidents
that occurred during the synodical session
at Calvary Presbyterian Church yester
day was the unlooked for entrance and
the procession of the sturdy, happy little
wards from the Presbyterian Orphanage
at San Anselmo.
He. says, however, that since dismissing
the contest he has learned that McKee
deliberately defrauded him, and that in
stead of the estate of Mrs. .Milsaps being
worth $15,000 it Is worth at least $60,000.
He says that McKee, after securing a
dismissal of the contest In Alameda Coun
ty, went to Napa County and offered
Mrs. Milsaps' will for probate. It was
admitted, and McKee was appointed ex
ecutor thereof, and â¢ wijl, says Milsaps,
unless restrained by an order of court,
proceed to convert the estate to his own
use. He therefore asks the court for
judgment for $24,500, less the $4,500 re
ceived by him as a compromise, and for
an injunction restraining McKee from dis
posing of any of the estate pending the
trial of his action.
He says that a few days after, a tender
of the will was made in court he filed a
contest to the document, and that McKee
then came to him and offered to com
promise the contest. He charges that his
wife's nephew represented to him that
the estate was not worth more than
$15,000 and offered him $4500 to dismiss his
proceedings. Mileaps says that after he
had been importuned by McKee many
times he finally accepted his offer and
withdrew his contest, firmly believing
when he' did so that he was getting all
that he was entitled to. -
1 Milsaps . alleges in his complaint that
' for many months prior to the death of his
wife she was under the influence of Mc-
Kee. He says that McKee prevailed upon
her to make two deeds, giving him her
realty, and that shortly before her death.
acting upon his suggestions, she made a
/will bequeathing to him "all her estate
with the exception of 13000 that she be
queathed to two other nephews, Georga
and Fred Graham. MllBaps says that
when McKee offered the will of Mrs. Mil
saps for probate in Alameda County it
was refused probate.
In a suit for $20,000 filed yesterday \sj
Jesse G. Milsaps against W. J. McKee,
nephew of _ Milsaps' late wife, Jane F.
Milsaps, he charges McKee with cheating
him out of the amount named and also of
using his influence over Mrs. Milsaps to
deprive him, Milsaps, of hia rights in the
160,000 estate left by, Mrs. Milsaps when
she died at Alameda in June, 1901.
Taylor's estate is worth about $22,000.
He made a will a few days before his
death, bequeathing it to four nephews and
nieces, share and chare alike, cutting off
entirely his other heirs at law. One of
the latter, Lizzie Taylor, expects to show
during the hearing of her contest of the
will that the testament was made at a
time when Taylor was incompetent, and
that it was made upon the suggestion of
his landlady, Mrs. Talbot. Mrs. Talbot,
it is claimed. In her anxiety to have her
lodger make a will, read over a number
of Taylor's letters and, finding them from
relatives, persuaded Taylor to mention
them in his will. The consequence was.
it Is claimed, that Taylor's will bequeath
ed his estate to only such of his relatives
as were lucky enough to have their let
ters to him remain in his possession. The
fact of the will being made under such
circumstances is admitted by Mrs. Tal
bot. It is asserted that it is the object
of the executrix to obtain possession of
the personal property of the deceased,
consisting of Government bonds worth
JK'.wO and about $8000 cash and place her
self beyond the jurisdiction of the court.
Armed with the decree of partial distri
bution she was about to remove the bonds
from a safety deposit box when she was
served with a restraining order. Attorney
Wagner, who served the order, said yes
terday when he- prevented her from with
drawing the bonds she abused him fear
fully.
A lively battle was waged yesterday In
Judge Troutt's court by the attorneys in
the estate of the late James D. Taylor. It
was precipitated by a # motion made by
W. P. Humphreys, attorney for James
D. Taylor Jr., a nephew of the deceased,
and also attorney for absent heirs, to set
aside a decree of partial distribution made
recently by Judge Troutt on petition of
Bee Taylor, executrix of the will. Hum
phreys said he was In possession of facts
showing that fraud was being practiced
upon the estate and he wished it held
intact until such time as he had an op
portunity to show that the interests of
his client were being despoiled. Opposi
tion to the decree was also made by At
torney L.. T. Wagner, representing Lizzie
Taylor, a sister of the deceased, who a
few days ago filed a contest of Taylor's
will, and attorney Rltter for numerous
creditors of the estate. They both inti
mated that the estate was not being prop
erly handled and eaid that if the decree
of partial distribution held the heirs at
law of Taylor would suffer. In the face
of this showing Judge Troutt stayed all
proceedings and refused to grant the mo
tion of Charles Xaylor, attorney for the
executrix, to set aside an order restrain
ing her from using the funds now in her
hands until the claims of all interested
persons are settled. Naylor endeavored
to have Wagner declared without stand
ing in the court because he could pro
duce no evidence showing that he repre
sented Lizzie Taylor, but Troutt ruled
against him. He made the same ruling
when Naylor tried to show Humphreys
without standing, and then put the en
tire matter over until next Wednesday.

year ago could I Fhut off the coffee for
any length of time.
"At that time I was suffering terribly
from ttomaxrh trouble, nervousness, head- j
achee and all the other ills that go with j
s badly upset coffee stomach. I am a I
school teacher, and If I made my coffee |
Ftrong enough to stimulate my stomach j
J could work fine for a time, but would
collapse at night. Gradually 1 failed to
jrt cumulation from the coffee and my
brain tfeemed actually clogged up from
drinking coffee and my etomach was in a
Â»-retehed BtÂ»te.
"A friend came to see me and advised
â¢ ihat I try Postum and then went out and j
tot cne a. package, ehe was *o certain It
would help me. But my landlady did not
make It right, and I was so disappointed
Â»ith the ta*te that I went back to coffee.
My health finally cot eo bad I was on
the point of giving up school work. Then
tny friend returned to see. me one day I
Â«nd ask'-o about the Postum. and when'
Â«.V.e found out what the trouble was she i
"made It for roe according to directions,
boiling It full fifteen minutes, and to my
fcurprise I found It delicious.
"Then I ehut Off the coffee and found It
rasy. to do by drinking Postum In Hb
jlace. which completely satisfied any cof-
fre taste and I began to feel better al-
most immediately. I have used Postum
' evor since and my stomach has not given
rae a minute's trouble. I am now strong
i-cain. my nerves are steady and r.ormai
ond I feel so fine I cannot begin to tell
you how thankful I am.
"I perruaded my brother, who was an
inveterate coffee drinker for years, to give
vp the coffee and try Postum and he has
Ij2d such grand results from this that be
t-ays he trill never go back to coffee.
When I went home on a visit to my pa-
. rÂ«nts I persuaded them to use Postum 5n
the place of coffee and the results have
been that mother's nervousness and
eleeplessness have disappeared." Name

drawbackâ the birds spoiled before they
could get them home.
Fred Butler, Frank Maskey and Frank

anticipated.
The first match will be an uncompleted
one between J. A. Code and Horace Mann

each has won a set fromHhe other. The
third and deciding set will be played to
morrow morning. The wiirfler will make
the eighth man In the fourth round and
will receive a prize. He will be pitted
against George Baker, who will concede
odds of "owe 5-6." Baker should win this
match with little \ difficulty. The first
match In this round will be between. Guy
Lytton and Herbert Long. The latter is
called upon to give Lytton a handicap, of
"3-6." Long is an erratic player, -but 'if
he plays anything like his game he should
dispose of Lytton In short order. Â¦' ? ! .
The match between Will Allen and Neil
Baker will undoubtedly be "a good one.
Allen will allow odds of "owe* 15 2-6" and
will have his hands full doing so. Baker
plays a game that is better suited to
handicap conditions than almost any one
in the tournament. While he is not as
brilliant a player as Allen he is steadier,
and can get the balls back. His only
stroke In the back court Is a lob, and Al
len will have trouble handling It. At the
net Baker seldom kills, but when the time
comes cuts them off cleverly.' ~ ... , Â¦-Â¦--â¢

best players have survived. J. D. Mac-

PLAYERS OF RIVAL UNIVERSITIES WHO ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUPY A PROMINENT POSITION ON THE
GRIDIRON DURING THE IMPORTANT' FOOTBALL CONTESTS WHICH REMAIN TO BE PLAYED AND
WHICH END WITH THE INTERCOLLEGIATE MATCH. (^
This round does not close until the 31st
Inst. giving the contestants two-Satur
days in which to play. It Is expected two
of the four matches will be played to-day,
namely Cook and McLaren and -Moff at
and Earsman. Moffat is considered more
skillful than Earsman and will probably
win. While McLaren is/a favorite over
his opponent he will have a hard time
beating him. The same' may. be : said- of
McNaught in his match with James Gray.
Joseph Gray is in . better practice ' than
McLachlan and should win. The final
match will be played November -.14. On
November 18 the annual meeting -for the
election of officers will be held,. and ar
rangements will be made to begin a new
tournament at once. As the membership
has increased rapidly during the present
tournament a larger entry list will un
doubtedly result In the next events -
Webster made a good showing -against
McLaren last Saturday. The, match was
close up to the last when McLaren forged
ahead and won seven points straight. The
eight men left will oppose each other as
follows: James Gray: vs. Thomas Mc-
Naught. Joseph Gray vs. J. McLachlan,
J. C. Moff at vs. J. M. Earsman, John
McLaren vs. Wallace Cook.' . ,
was expected to beat James Gray without
much difficulty, but the latter beat his
apponent by the one-sided score of 21 to 3.
Joseph Gray won by a like score from Dr.
Hamilton. The doctor has shown j great
form ' In this tournament, but " was no
match for Gray on Saturday. " â¢
The work of the backs and, In fact, the
whole team was much faster this week
than it has been all season. Risley, Sned-
Iga'r. Muther and Whipple are developing
rapidly and are mowing great holes in
the second eleven. Mini was hurt a
while ago and he is not digging in so
hard as he is accustomed, as he does not
want to be put out of it permanently.
The eleven began secret practice- in the
gymnasium Thursday night. New plays
Trtll be practiced there every night until
the game. In the practice on -the field
this week the coaches have been trying
the guards, Overall and Stow, back of the
line a cood deal.
The varsity will play the. Chemawa In
dian eleven on the Berkeley campus to
morrow afternoon. On Wednesday . next
the team will play an alumni team com
posed principally of members of -.t^e. fam
ous '98 eleven, as follows: Gendotti or
Dunbar, center; Athearn, right, guard;
Grelsberg, left guard; Castlehun, â¢ right
tackle; "Jim" Whipple, left tackle; Claude
Starr and Louis Decoto, ends; 'Kerf oot
or Ellis, quarter; "Pete" Kaarsberg, full
back; "Locomotive" Smith, right half;
Percy Hall, left half.
Howard, the left tackle. Is limping with
water on the knee, but manages to play
every day.
Belknap's wound consists of a wrenched
ligament. It is slow to heal and may
keep him out of the game until too late.
The coaches are retaining him ,on the
training table, however, in the hope that
he will get well soon, in which- case he
will be tried out again. "Johnny" More,
who is just getting over an injured knee,
will take Belknap's place at quarterback
as soon as the doctor thinks it safe to try
him in his old place. In the meantime
Geary, who is a fighter all the time, is
passing out the ball to the backs.
The coaches are trying out Forse for
fullback and from the way he goes at
the line and eats up. the ground, the
chances are they will retain him in that
position. It puzzled the coaches for a
long time to know what to do with Forse,
whether to put him in as tackle or back
of the line, but now they seem to have
him in the right spot. More was being
tried In the posHion before he was hurt,
but he was considered a trifle too light
for it, and now that a quarter is -needed
h<- will fill in there.
about some changes this week in the
line-up of the University of California
eleven. These changes are likely to be
permanent, as Hudson and Belknap, the
most severely hurt, may not recover in
time to get into condition again before
the big game.
Hudson is wearing his leg in a plaster
cast to mend a broken bone received in
practice a week ago. Broken bones do
not heal rapidly and Hudson will cer
tainly be kept off his feet until two weeks
before the game. This will prevent^bis
getting back Into his old form again, so
the coaches are trying out other men for
right end. The candidates for the va
cancy are Burke, Craig and Oliver. All
are good players, but none of them has
the â¢ bulldog spirit and weight of Hud

.;'Twas*a lucky day for the Cripples all
around. Up to the seventh round they
could not approach Fitzgerald. Then
Gorton led oft with a bingle to center and
an error let Hitt arrive at first. O'Hara
beat out a bunt and Rockenfleld drew a
puss, which forced Gorton home.
Murdock lined one to Casey. He threw
the ball to Egan and Truck let* the leather
elide away from him. On this play Hitt
scored. Schwartz responded with one
that went away over Casey's head and
Rockenfleld and O'Hara registered with
the lart two tallies of the 3ay. The score:

RUNS AND HITS BT INNINGS.
The score was â¢ 4 to '3 in favor of the
Cripples , when Knell went : In to bat for
Fitzgerald In the ninth. Hitt unwound
himself in a manner terrible to behold
and frightened the veteran so badly that
he promptly fanned. Then . Hitt took a
voyage- sky ward and pitched twelve wide
ones In a row, walking Casey, Hlldebrand
and McLaughlin.
Only one was oait-andl*he Senators were
confident ' of victory. ' So â¢were the fans.
Peter chased : Hitt.- from the â¢ mound and
Into the box walked McKay. He threw a
baU-and a"etrike to Doyle. Then the bat
ter landed on one S and away It went
toward' right field. .. . â¢
â¢The-. fans! yelled like mad and Mike
Flshex -was preparing to, gQ. home, when
Schwartz "suddenly arose into the sky,
pulled down the drive and winged it over
tclleeserly, completing, a , double play
and ending the game when it seemed the
Senators would make a hundred runs.
saw a game of hall that .was posi
tivelytbV limit It was slow and tedious,
brilliant at times and wound up with a
double play, in the last spasm, allowing
the Cripples to, get away- with the glory
by .the smallest margin that ever hap
pened here. Score: Oakland, 4; Sacra
mento, 3. '/Â¦*>;',
"That unknown quantity, Mr. Hitt, with
the .original Bwing on his southern wing,
was jtiven & chance to shine on the Oak
land slab and the way he performed
would 'give ' heart disease to any one,
whether he knew anything about the
game or not. He" was good sometimes
and then again he was so bad that some
of the; fans "threw their hands skyward
and begged. Peter to remove the lad and
go to, tha front himself.* Mr. Hitt was at
last removed In the ninth inning after
he had walked three In a row and struck
one out. ZfuVS.'^ .

S] Four-Round Comedy Bout
THB.'going at. the Sen Francisco Ath
letlo Club last night was slightly on
the wane. Out of seven bouts on the
. card only two or three were up to
the usual, high, standard. The main at
traction of . the entertainment was a dis
appointment. Inasmuch as the chief fac
tor, Gua Koater, quit in the second round
of | the" bout and old Tom. Sullivan, who
was wont to perform In the palmy days,
celebrated his return to the ring with a
victory. Â¦' - - *v*
Sullivan was fat and had about as crach
business in a prize ring as a temper anca
lecturer Yet ' he showed ' that his old
time cleverness has not deserted him and
as far as tha bout went he had Koste?
looking like a monkey.
Koater began to play for Sullivan's
stomach, which was the real thing for
size. But the big fellow was wise enough
to keep at a distance when the teamster
came to him and he got off with a few
slight wallops.
Koeter began to rush Sullivan around in
the second and made a few of the peopla
think the latter was due to take a fall on
the carpet for keeps. But suddenly tha
old-timer brought over his light and it
shot Into Koster's Jaw. The teamster
stalled for a while and then Sullivan be
gan to rush him. He went down in a heap
without being hit hard and stayed there,
while the multitude yelled for Sullivan.
Mike Synfy, the "terrible Greek." and
Buck Sullivan put up the strangest scrap
ever seen inside of the roped arena. Synfy
la tail and weighs about ninety pounds
with his Tuxedo suit on. The other fel
low is shorter than Joe Walcott. twice as
thick and positively the funniest â¢ thing
that ever stepped Into a prize ring. They
wrestled and tu&sled about that enclosure
for four rounds and the mob went wild
with delight Synfy knows a little about
the game, but Sullivan never saw a fight
before. Synfy got the decision, although.
no blow* were struck and no one waa
hit but a spectator, whom, Sullivan
bumped against.
George Henry knocked out William Fer
guson In two rounds. Jack Adams fin
ished Joo Regan in three; Plerpont Ord
way settled Joe Harklns In tha tamÂ«
period, and Charles Augustus made, Jus
tin La Grave Quit after a minute of ac

Bptcl&l Dispatch' to Tho Call.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 23.â The Uttle hap-:
penlngr between . Jack- Johnson and
Bam McVey for the colored boxing
championship will occur next Thurs
day evening at Hazard's Pavilion. It is
exciting more Interest in* Blackvilie cir
cles than any social " function that; has
token place for some time, tha' Madison
Square cake walk not excepted.
The giant Ethiopians h'ave been' guar
anteed a $1000 purse by Manager McCary
and many are wondering where 'the lat
ter Is "going to get off at." The" seating
capacity of the pavilion is 3S0O and as the
prices for this occasion have been tilted
a bit there is every probability of a $8500
house. 'Â¦â¢'''
Both fighters are reported In excellent
trim ' and . each looks the part. Johnson
will enter the ring weighing 1S5 pounds
and will be seconded by Mike Shaughn
essy. Australian Tim Murphy and Kid
Solomon. McVey, shorter in height than
his opponent, but of more stocky build,
will tip the scales at 215 pounds. Al
though the last time the pair met John
son received the decision at the end of
the twenty rounds, the betting is now
even money, though Johnson will un
doubtedly be a 10 to 8 favorite at ring
side.
On their former mlx-up Billy Roche
of Oxnard, the astute manager of Me-
Vey, was 111 with pneumonia and it is
claimed there were "doings," aa some
smart money was wagered on Johnson,
with a guarantee that .there was no
chance to lose. Roche himself admits
that he has been told that he was handed
one. Rocha says there will be no. hold
ing back this time. His man has a
punch in either hand .and will go in to
win or get whipped in short order.
Because of his contagious good humor
Jack Johnson is popular down this way,
and more especially down in Blackville,
where the pin money for a year of many
a household will be staked on the chances
of Jack. Should he lose, Jack's name is
down for an awful fist beating and pos
sibly just a few razor remarks. Before
he began training Mistah Johnsing an
nounced a decided preference ' for that
palatable bird, the chicken.- For break
fast Jack has a squab chicken and a mess
of hoecake. For lunch a two-year-old
hen fried In four equal parts is partaken
, of and at dinner time Jack demolishes a
'ropSter and a half, two dozen hot bis
cuits and a few other miscellaneous.
Then the admiring | boarders listen to
Johnson's megaphone moan, "An" daf 9
the way to spell c-h-1-c-k-e-n." ' .
If confidence will return a winner. John
son 'will walk in. In referring to the
bugar beet fed toon from Oxnard, Jack
says, "Why, he won't hit me all night."
Johnson is assuredly the more clever
man of the two and will try to rattle Mc-
Vey with stinging lefts, retaining his
right for the ebony gloss process at the
finish. /
It has been claimed that Joe Walcott's
great-great-grandfather held the cocoa
nut-throwing record down in South Af
rica for ten consecutive years, and Mc-
Vey, who never sailed a craft on Bantry
Bay or never belabored an opponent over
the* hea# - with a shillelah at Drogheda
fair, as his name might Imply, looks aa
if he might be kin to Walcott. Billy
Roche says his man will reverse the for
mer decision sure and the Los Angeles
gamblers eagerly await the coming of the
Oxnard contingent. More than unusual
interest attaches to this affair,, as It Is
thought Champion Jim Jeffries will \ultl
mately agree to fight the . winner. If he
does there is little danger of a total
eclipse. It looks as if Charley Eyton
would be chosen" refered.
Frankie Neil picked up a lively bird
the other evening in Johnny Reagan and
got a draw. Neil entered the ring suf
fering from a severe â¢ cold * in the head.
Impairing his breathing apparatus, and
his work lacked its customary enap and
vim. Reagan is no punisher, but his
maneuvering was extremely clever. Nell
had the better of the contest at that and
if his finish In the twentieth round could
have been attended with more dash the
decision might have been his. In the sev
enteenth round he had Reagan's bread
basket well flattened out, but could not
land a "drop curtain."

The Siberia looked very big and hand
some as ehe left the wharf. Her immense
cargo caused her to set deep in the wa
ter and as she straightened out for her
run to the Golden Gate her marks showed
her drawing twenty-nine feet forward and
thirty-one feet aft.
Her passengers included the following
named:
ThÂ« names of two' Norwegian barks were
added yesterday to the overdue list. The Clm
brla is out 10$ days from Rangoon for Cape
Town and the Charlonus is out 110 days from
Banbury for Port Natal. They are both quoted
at 10 per cent. The St. Mungo is still quoted
at 40 per cent and the Fl fee hi re at 15 per cent.

STOCKTON. Oct. 23.â An enactment of

misdemeanor for an employment agency
to withhold money from a client unless
a position is secured for him is to be

$160 for a position at Rio Vista, and did
not i secure it, has sworn to a complaint
against William Bales, who conducts an
employment agency. Â«e claims' that

For many years the owners of apple
orchards in California have been com
pelled to spend large sums annually to
protect their interests against the codlin
moth. This insect has persisted in laying
eggs in apples and the result haa been
wormy apples unless several costly spray-
Ings of the fruit have been made during
the ripening of the crop.
Now it la announced that Horticultural
Commissioner Cooper has strong hope
that the day of the codlin moth in Cali
fornia will soon come to an end. Several
pests that have afflicted the fruit raisers
of California have been disposed of in
large degree by the introduction of bene
ficial Insects. An enemy for the codlin
moth has been discovered in Southern Eu
rope. The discoverer is George Comperd
of Los Angeles. He found the codlin
moth's destroyer and studied it fully and
to a demonstration of its efficiency. In
Southern Europe there is no need to
spray for protection against the codlin
moth. Its insect enemy keeps it down so
that at least 95 per cent of the apples are
not disturbed.
Commissioner Cooper is so interested in
having the reign of the dreaded codlin
moth ended that he has opened corre
spondence with the Government of West
Australia, which may share the expense
with California of bringing the remedy
from abroad.
Yesterday Quarantine Officer Craw sent
to Cuba a colony of Insects to destroy a
parasite that is preying upon the pineap
ple Â¦ industry in Cuba. A similar service
has been performed for Tahiti to save the
trees of various kinds from destruction
by the cottony cushion scale. .
By the breaking of a rope and a steel
hook supporting a steel truss weighing
three tons Peter Anderson was mangled
to death yesterday morning on Seventh
avenue, near C street, in Richmond. The
accident occurred on the site of the Gen
tlemen's Riding Academy In course of
erection. Anderson was digging a trench
in the sand, while thÂ« heavy trues was
being lifted into place. When it had
reached the height of thirty feet the Inch
and a quarter rope which was around
cne end of the truss and the inch steel
pulley hook attached to the other end
snapped and Instantly the heavy weight
plunged downward, striking Anderson on
the back and burying him two feet in the
sand. When' Deputy Coroner Meehan
and Mesenser Frank Murphy arrived on
the scene they were obliged to dig tho
body out of the. eand. Anderson was
fearfully mangled, every bone in his
body appearing to have been broken.
Anderson was a member of the Struo
tural Iron Workers' Union and was 31
years of age. He was married only three
weeks ago. Immediately after the acci
dent /the structural iron worker* quit
work in a body.

"WASHINGTON, Oct 23.â The Secretary
of the* Interior has completed and for
warded to the Secretary of the Treasury
his estimates of the appropriations neces
sary to conduct the affairs of the Interior
Department for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1905. The estimates place the to
tal requirement for the department at
$156,000,000, which is about J3.000.000 less
than the appropriation for the current
year. j
The proposed reduction will be made In
the Pension Bureau and the Indian Of
tice. The Estimate for pensions is $136,
800,000, or $1,000,000 less than the appro
priation made for this year. There also is
a cut of $1,800,000 in the estimate for the
Indian Bureau, the estimate for the ex
penses of conducting the affairs of the
five civilized tribes of Indians is $259,695.
The reduction in the pension estimate is
due to a calculation of deaths of pension
ers made by the Commissioner of Pen
sions. . ,.
"Oh no. Look at that diamond and that
combination of awful colors. Bartender

"Plain ordinary drummer; dry goods,"
Â¦was the decision of the third.
"Oh. Mr. Kerrell." said the first of the
girls to the company's general passenger
agent, "come and settle this for us. Who
is tnat tall, thin man in the Prince Al
bort and tall hr.t. and what does he do?"
"That is Tom McKay, the apostle of
evaporated thought," and Kerrell passed
on leaving the puzzled trio still wonder

Among the Siberia's passengers were
many well known people. George R.

liner. He has been in Washington ar

The Pacific Mail Company's liner Si
beria. Captain J. . Tremaine Smith, sailed
yesterday for the Orient with more than
TtO passengers and 9000 tons of freight.
While the majority of the passengers
were Asiatics the big steamship had on
board all the cabin passengers her berth
ing- capacity -would accommodate. An
hour before sailing time tha wharf was
crowded -with the friends of those going
away and piled on the dock near the liner
v.-as a mountain of baggage that consti
tuted a fair sized cargo in Itself, but
â¢which Captain Dilson, In spite of tba
short time at his disposal, had all snugly
aboard by the sailing hour.
The Siberia- calls at Manila this time
end had for that port considerable freight
and more than a score of passengers. One
of the liner's passengers attracted the at
tention of three pretty girls, whose
guesses as to his identity and occupation
Tvill prpve interesting to the local trans
portation world.
"He's a barber," said one of the fair
tucj^sers.

ISHPEMINO, Mich.. Oct 23.â After, a
desperate struggle with three alleged rob
bers of the Superior postofflce, six police
men wounded and captured two of the
trio on a train which arrived here to-day.
Marshal Fandrom, being advised by the
Superior Chief of Police that three men
suspected of the postofflce robbery were
on the train, he and five officers went to
West Ishpemlng, where the train was
boarded. The marshal and two officers
took the rear of the coaches. Patrick Col
lins, with the other two men, went to the
front. The suspects were on the alert and
two of them began firing at the officers
at the rear as soon as they entered. Then
running to the front of the car, they met
Collins and his assistants. One of the sus
pects raised his revolver to shoot Collins,
but the officer fired first, sending the bul
let through the man's hand. The wound
ed man -and another suspect, shot in the
back by the marshal, then surrendered.
The third suspect escaped and started for
the woods. Officers are now after him.
About $100 was found in the pockets of
the two men. " â¢

The Chicago letter of Bolton, de Ruyter &
Co. said: "Weather is fine in the Northwest
and- reports Indicate that farmers are selling
wheat freely. The Modern Miller also reports
them free sellers : , In the Southwest and the
movement restricted by lack of cars. There
ia a moderate cash situation to-day, with only
a fair amount of business reported so far. The
situation at the moment is complicated some
what by the Russian-Japanese affair. Broom
hall cables that this influence Is what Im
parted strength to the Liverpool market. He
intimates that it is increasing the demand for
flour. This of course may result in an in
creased foreign buying of wheat. If it does,
the market will no doubt respond to it. With
out it steady accumulation of stocks will in
time likely tell on the prices. There Is enough
bull sentiment outside of the war news to
give us an active market In case the war ma
terializes."
This market was steady and unchanged ex
cept a rise in futures.

Local trade In fresh fruits was quiet as usual
on Friday, but there was an active demand for
good table Grapes in crates for shipment on
the Puget Sound steamer. The narrow-gauge
train with fresh lUDPlles was delayed by the
railroad accident across the bay and available
supplies of fancy stock were insufficient to
eati3fy the shipping demand, and several or
der* could not be filled. Fine Tokay and Cor
nlchon sold uo to 85c t>er crate, but the top
quotation was the ruling price for the general
run of offerings. Receipts of large open boxes
from Martinez came to hand rather late, and
as a result there was quite a surplus unsold
at the close. Prices, however, were unchanged.
There was very little doing In Wine Grapes.
Apples were abundant and continued quiet.
Figs were In Hrht receipt and cleaned up
quickly at steady rates. The other tree fruits
were plentiful and unchanged. There was a
little firmness in Cantaloupes and Nutmeg
Melons during the early trade, owing to the
late arrival of the river boat, but the market
weakened upon the receipt of fresh supplies.
Strawberries were in ample supply and stood
as previously quoted^ with undesirable lots go-
Ing to the canners at the minimum quotation.
Raspberries were delayed by the train Â¦wreck
and had to be carried over. Cranberries and
Huckleberries were firm.
â¢ The consignment of new crop Navel Oranges
that arrived on the preceding day was still on
hand, the stock being too green to find a buyer.
A car of late Valenclas came In and was
firmly held at 12 2A@2 75 per box. Otherwise
there was nothing new to report.

N'EW TORK, Oct. 23. â Amalgamated Copper
abicrbt-d an overwhelming portion of to-day's
busiaees in the Mtock market. For a good
deal cf the time the de&Hnf* in this stock were
larger than in all others combined, and it com
priwed about cne-third of the aggregate sales
of the day. The day's total showed & consid
erable shrinkafe in the recent average and
r.utninff but a negative significance can bÂ«
tirawn from tÂ£.e day's market. On this basis
Â«>r interpretation Â»hÂ« market must be said to
liivf oftVied a coed resistance to the day's dls
tjrbing factor, a* haÂ» been the case during the
"%hcle Â«jf the wetk. From the point of view of
liÂ«e professional traders there was an inciina
tifjti to draw tlie inference that the backset re
ceived by Amalgamated Copper would induce
e. very conservative market attitude on the part
'â¢' <1mÂ» Â£tiindard O!l Company. As the pro
rt*rtnmt1 clement lays great stress upon the
: â¢if>poÂ«'d attitude of the so-called leading in
â¢ieif-rti. this inference caused some sentimental
"ffett. Hut the professional impression was

It begins to look aÂ« If Eggs had touched their
top notch for the present. Receipts of ranch
are still light, but when Eggs get up so that
the public have to ray a retail price of r>c
apiece for them they stop eating them and takÂ«
something cheaper. I Several wholesalers cl
their prices yesterday from 55c to 50c and some
retailers who received consignment* direct
from the country turned sellers and offered thei r
gc>da to other retailers and even to the whole
salers. At the same time there were enough
Eggs selling at 55c to preserve this figure aa
a quotation. -
There was no change whatever In Butter or
Ch**se. Both were In ample supply, with
stocks still unevenly distributed.

Supplies of river Potatoes continued far in
excess of the demand, but there was less poor
stock on the market, the recent demand for
shipment to the Southwest, together with the
light receipts, having checked the accumula
tion. Salinas Burbanks were steady under
light receipts 'and a good demand. Oregons
were largely nominal. The Portland steame
brought down about 1000 bags. . which had not
been marketed up to a late hour.-. The market
was overstocked with Sweets, which were dull
at . the recently reduced quotations. Onions
were unchanged, with the market steady for
good slock.
Receipts of vegetables were light, fresh sup
plies having been delayed by a railroad acci
dent across the bay. Carrted-over stock was
abundant and met with a good demand at the
previously quoted rates.

this caused some selling by local traders, which
result*! -In 'a somewhat easier tone, but a re
covery 'soon' followed on' covering by : shorts
and fair buying by a prominent bujl. Trading
was quiet the latter part of the. session and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, t 1903.

The Weird Elephant Spirit.
/> O"f HUNDRED yards distant rusty masses of ironstone preceded
f I an undulation in the flat country, and toward the base of one
\ \\ " tall block Lord Winstone descried an object which mage him
. JL rub his eyes ; with frank amazement.
"Near the foot of the rock, his back against it, and shadowed entirely
from the sun's litfht by a natural grotto' fn the stone, sat an enormous
man or ape. Its stature was colossal, thpugh smaller by far than
the natives of Mapora had described; its naked body was bright RTeen;
its hands were folded over its breast; its misshaped head was bent for*
ward, and wild, snaky hair, also of vivid green, fell luxuriantly around tt. v
-while pressed upon its crown was a wreath of flowers.
"In the midst of this strange kingdom, silent, motionless and alone,
with uncouth face and distorted limbs, reigned this huge green monster
.in mortal shape. 'Â¦-Â¦Â¦- f
"Lord Winstone got out his field glasses, without which he never
hunted, and trained them on the grotto.-. He stared awhile, and then his
breath left his lungs in a gasp of surprise, as he returned the glasses to
their case and pushed, forward."
Without doubt thd reader will gasp with equal amazement and no less
curiosity, that such strange things can exist even in the Africa of to-day.
but Eden Philpotts knows absolutely whereof he speaks when he made
the great Elephant Spirit of the Dark Continent one of the bie features
of his new novel, "The Golden Fetich," now pinning in the Sunday Call,
thesecond installment of which will be published next Sunday. -it. gives,
you Africa as it really is now and as it has not been shown since the
wonderful explorations of the great Stanley.
But unbelievable as the foregoing extract may seem, stranger things
are being found right here at home. Look in the next Sunday Call, for
"Fitch's Mine of Mystery." It tells of\the discovery under the very
feet of civilization in California, only a few months ago, of a mine of
Â¦. fire that has utterly baffled the best scientists in the world. Chunks of
this wonderful mineral that has a flame which cannot be destroyed have
been taken from Fitch's mine, ground into powder, assayed by every
known process, tested bv every possible standard, and still it remains a
mystery â and still it glows on with undiminished brightness. It cannot
be destroyed and it cannot be extinguished. Wonderful as is the newly
discovered radium, of which there is less than one pound in the whole
world and which costs a fabulous sum for a single ounce. Fitch's new
mineral is even more astounding and by far more puzzling. lAnd to'
think that the earth in California is just full of it, but â read next Sun-
day's Call.
There you will find other absorbing things. "A Daughter of the
Aurora," by Jack London; the big two-page railroad story by Frank
H. Spearman. "The Dispatcher's Story"; a full page of "Half-Hour
Storiettes"; "The Unsolved Mystery of the Tinian Monoliths." by Cap-
tain H. F. Tower, which is something that Uncle Sam has recently ac-
quired along with a whole sea of queer islands; "Emigration the Negro's
Only Salvation," by Bishop H. M. Turner; a full page of "Gems from the
Photographer's Exhibit." to be held next week at the Mechanics' Pavil-
ion. (You'll watch for tfiose pictures.) "The Picture Coat." which is
something'sÂ© new that nowoman who cares a pin how she looks (and
*Svhat "woman doesn't?) will even dream of missing the next Sunday Call.

In her testimony Mrs. McAllon said: "I
was conipletely . under the hypnotic influ
ence of McAllon before he forced me into
marrying him. He used to make passes
in front of my eyes, and I would go into
a e<frt of . trance, when he would make
me do all sorte of silly things. He would
occasionally make me flsh in a cuspidor
for trout, and at other times would give
ir.e a piece of soap and make me chew it.
Earing it was candy. One time he gave
me a piece of rope and -made me believe
1 was a fireman. I am satisfied I was
under his hypnotic influence when he
compelled me to go with him to San Jose
and marry him."
Mrs. Smith corroborated her sister's tes
timony, and said she had also been hyp
notized by McAllon and compelled to do
Eillr things.
The suit was not contested by McAllon,
but the Judge expressed a doubt as to
Â¦whether / the fact that the plaintiff was
i;nder hypnotic influence would be a suf
ficient ground for annulling the marriage.
It was a new feature for him, and he
t=aid he would like to be further enlight
ened as to the condition of a person's
mlr.d regarding the capability to enter
into a marriage contract when under an
other person's influence.
Attorney J. E. Manning, who represents
the plaintiff, said he would subpena Pro
fessor Tyr.dall and other authorities to
testify, and on that understanding the
Judge continued the case till Tuesday
next.
TÂ£Â»e parties were married In San Jose oa
January IS. 1301, although it is alleged
that the plaintiff had at the time a hus
band named James A. Turner living, from
whom she had not been separated or di
ve reed.

Uonzi. It wu claimed by both ladles that

Suence.

'Since then the Illness of other members
of the family gave rise to suspicion that
their drinking water was tainted. The
mother and her two children gave pro
nounced evidences of lead poisoning and
remained in a critical condition â¢ for sev
eral days. All of them were removed
f rpm their home in Mill Valley to St.
Luke's Hospital, in this city. Dr. Austin
was called in and succeeded in saving the
lives of the mother and one child, but
Verel was so terribly infected with the
poisonous metal that she died yesterday
morning. \ William Redford, â¢ the father,
also showed symptoms of lead poisoning,
but the fact that his occupation called
him away from home and he did not
drink much of the water at the house pre
vented him from becoming dangerously
infected with the poison.
An investigation developed that the
plumbers In connecting the house with the
water main had left large deposits of car
bonate of lead mixed with oil In the tank
furnishing water to the house, and that
this was carried in the water consumed
by the family. The members of the fam
ily of Engineer Walker, who reside next
door to the Redfords, were similarly af
fected, but they cleaned their water tank
at the first developments of the poisoning
and were not seriously Injured. Redford
has secured a bottle of the infected water,
which shows a heavy deposit of carbonate
of lead.

cape. -
Metzinger was arrested on August 29
by Detectives Regan and O'Connell on
charges of burglary and grand larceny.
He was accused of entering the room of
Miss Nora McNamara at 1046 Folsom
street and stealing her trunk, which con
tained all her personal effects, and also
with stealing a bicycle belonging to Al
fred "W. Tuttle. Owing to his previous
good character and the fact that his wife
was sick Police Judge Mogan on October
6 reduced the charges to petty larceny
and sentenced him to serve six months
on each charge. Instead of being put in
the County Jail he was selected to act as
a trusty at the City Prison.
The sleeping apartments of the trusties,
eleven in. number, are located behind the
elevator. The windows look into , the
light well In the' center of the building.
Metzinger occupied a bunk at the extreme
south end of the structure, and it was out
of the window close to his bunk that he
made his escape. The other trusties say
that some of them, Metzinger included,
were talking till 12:30 o'clock, when they
fell asleep. Metzinger took none of them
into his confidence. Metzinger took "a
desperate risk In making his escape. The
window is about ninety feet from the
ground, and if he had lost his nerve or
the rope had broken he would have
Btruck against the glasa roof covering the
courtyard and been torn to pieces by the
broken glass like the hound that jumped
from the roof some months ago. How he
got the key to unlock the padlock is a
mystery, but it is supposed that some
friend slipped it to him while visiting him
in prison.
GETS A LIGHT SENTENCE.
The trusties are called at 5 o'clock each
morning to clean up, but, although they
must have seen the open window and the
dangling rope, they said nothing about It
to Sergeant Melody or Policemen Fan
ning, and Love, who were on duty at the
prison. . Metzinger' s absence was not
missed \ till the watch was changed and
Sergeant Bldwell, the prison-keeper, re
ported for duty at 8 o'clock. Bidwellwaa

It wasj^Ietzinger's duty to sweep out the
place '^behind the booking desk. It had
not been swept, and Bldwell went to the
trusties' apartments to ascertain the rea
son why. Then he discovered the open
window and dangling rope and found that
Metzinger was missing.
' TAKES DESPERATE RISK.
'Andrew Metzingrer, a trusty in the City
Prison who was serving a term of one
year, made 'a sensational escape early
yesterday morning, and detectives are
scouring the city to find him. He made
a rope out of his blankets, which he tied
to the leg of his bunk, then with a key,
which he had by some unknown means
procured, he unlocked the padlock that
keeps the iron grating over the window
secure, opened the window and slid down
the rope to the ledge of a window on the
next floor. Opening thlÂ» window, he Jump

severed by the force of the dynamite. .",
There ,is no clew as to who the ; un

the man accomolished his death Is not
