The theory of the Coroner's jury was
that some person had deliberately
planned the murder and arranged to
give the killing the appearance of sui
cide. Saunders carried 52000 insurance
in the Order of Artisans, and under the
terms of his policy his family can re
cover nothing If his death was self-in
flicted. In this Sheriff Colbath finds the
reason for the attempt to give the kill-
Ing the appearance of murder.
Sheriff Colbath says that Saunders
carried^ the extra revolver fully loaded
I and dropped the one with which he
fired the shot for the purpose of mak
ing it seem Improbable thnt the re
volver which fired the shot was his.
For a similar purpose, says Colbath,
he fired into his left temple wipi his
right hand, while he clutched a hand
kerchief In his left hand. Several times
during the evening, Saunder? -remarked
having seen a strange man who acted
queerly and had a false beanl. Sheriff
Colbath was unable to find "any one In
ButtevlUe who had seen; a stranger in
town that day and he believes that
story was made up by Saunders to lend
color to the murder theory. â¢

, The statements made by Commander
.Hubbard give a* detailed official de
scription of what already has been told
In. the. press dispatches.
â¢*Â» In concluding his report Commander
Hubbard incloses a letter, dated N6
vember - 9, from _ Commander Diehl of
the Boston, at - Panama, who repeats
the substance of an interview he had
the previous day with the British Vice
Consul, 'Mr. Rhodes, and the agent of
the Pacific Steam Navigation Company,
Mr. Peebles, regarding the British ships
Manivl and Quito, th$n at Buena Ven
tura. The British Vice Consul ex
pressed the belief that there was dan
ger, of x these vessels being seized by
the Colombians to be used as trans
ports, and' that If they started with
troops under convoy of the Colombian
gunboat Bogota the provisional govern
ment at Panama would send out gun
boats : and sink them.
â¢ Commander ; Diehl adds: "I told, him
to keep, me informed of the movements
of the steamers and I would attend to
the . matter." v '{':*;Â£
. Commander Diehl says he requested
Senor Qbarrio, who controls both the
army and the navy for the provisional
government of Panama, not to move
hlg gunboats for any . hostile purpose.
This was acceded to by Senor Obarrlo,
who at the same time pointed out that
if the Colombian forces ejected a land-
Ing at some distance from Panama, say
In Parita Bay. at the villages of Chlri
qul or Tomasillo, which he thought
probable, it would result in a long cam
paign to dislodge them, with possible
defeat at the end.

Second â That the company shall
formulate the methods by which griev
ances of its employes shall be adjusted
In the future.
The understanding is that the com
pany laid down these two proposals as
the basic principles that must be
granted by the union before further
negotiations could be entered upon.*,!. â¢
Darrow submitted the company's
proposition to the union, after which
he said that the strikers had accepted
the proposal of the company with Im
material modifications.
In their turn the men submitted a
proposition on the routing of cars. This
is the matter that will come before the
board of directors of the company to
morrow for its consideration.
Mayor Harrison and his Aldermanic
peace commission, after laboring for
three days, succeeded to-day in getting
a representative of each of the contend
ing parties to meet In conference. All
thÂ£ conferences heretofore have been
separate, but at the suggestion of May
or Harrison this afternoon the oppos
ing sides agreed to meet. E. R. Bliss,
general counsel for the company, was
authorized by President Hamilton to
act for the company, and Clarence S.
Â¦ Darrow, counsel for the strikers, was
given authority to act for the strikers.
â¢An hour later the two attorneys held
a conference in the office of Colonel
Bliss and discussed a basis of settle
ment. The result of the conference
will' be submitted to the directors of
the road to-morrow morning for full
action. The decision of the board of
directors will then be sent to Mayor
Harrison and the Aldermanic commis
sion, who will submit it to the execu
tive board of the strikers' union.
After the conference between Bliss
and Darrow it was learned that the
company had made two propositions
to the- union. Colonel Bliss submitting
them to Darrow. The propositions
were:. First â That the company shall
have the right to discipline and dis
c*harge its employes as it shall choose,
Â¦but this shall not be construed to mean
that any discrimination is made
against union men or non-union men.
CHICAGO, Nov. 20.â But two points
, prevented a peaceable adjustment of
the Chicago City Railway strike to-day
and the indications to-night are that
â¢these obstacles will be finally over
come and that a settlement will be
reached to-morrow. A virtual cessa
ti&n of hostilities has been declared' by
both sides while tho present peace ne
gotiations are in progress, and as all
the interested parties appear to be
makir,g every effort to bring the strug
gle to an end there seems likelihood
that all differences will be modified to
such, a degree that arbitration will
follow.
Two Minor Points
Remain to Be
. Settled.
The Grand Duchess of Coburg, moth
er of the divorced Grand Duchess of
Hesse and of the Czarina, is using all
her influence to utilize the present sad
event to bring about a reconciliation
between her daughter and the Grand
Duke of Hesse.
Her efforts have availed nothing so
far, since the mother of the dead
Princess is said to be too deeply in love
with Grand Duke Cyril of Russia, her
cousin, who may some time mount the
throne of Russia, to accept any pos
sible overtures from Â¦ her former hus
band.
This was evident at the funeral when
the divorced pair touched hands across
the coffin of their child and then went
apart as before the affliction that had
brought them face to face for the first
time in three years.
It had been said by the physicians
that the symptoms resembled cholera,
and later the official statement was
amended to appear that the Princess
had died of a particularly malignant
attack of typhoid fever.
The accounts given of the Illness of
the Princess tally with the suggestions
of poison, but not with that of typhoid
fever, which was latterly announced as
the cause of death.
BERLIN. Nov. 20.â Sinister rumors
came from Skiernewice, Poland, ac
counting for the sudden death of little
Princess Elizabeth of Hes3e, niece of
the Czarina of Russia, at the moment
of a family reunion. The little Princess
and her father were guests at Skierne
wice of the Czar and Czarina, and it
is now said that an attempt was made
to poison the whole royal party.
The Princess was the only victim, al
though the Czarina was made very ill
and the Czar was more or less affected
by the poison. There was some wonder
that the Czar and Czarina did not at
tend the funeral of their niece, but .it
is now explained that they were too 111
to be present.

RUSSIANS ARE SARCASTIC.
Editors Write of Acts of United
States in Panama.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 20.â The
officials of the Foreign Office eay Rus
sia doubtless will recognize Panama
in due time and will welcome the con
struction of a neutral canal, as her
commerce will share , in , the general
benefit derived therefrom.
A portion of the Russian press is sar
castic in the tone of its comments on
the part played by the United States
in Panama. The Novoe Vremya re
gards .the whole proceeding as being
the last evidence needed to prove the
imperialistic tendency of the United
States. . It intimates that \t will be
another Roman empire and recalls
Lord Palmerston's remark: "Who con
trols the Pacific controls the world."
The paper scoffs at the Idea of the
neutrality of the Panama canal in time
of war in which the United States is
Involved, if the canal Is built by the
United States, on the ground that the
canal will be subj ect ' to her sover
eignty.

ters are. at 3841 Nineteenth street, en-
Joyed its annual Thanksgiving enter

venture out owing to the trying
weather.

One of the features of the evening
was the increase of the audience dur
ing the course, of the entertainment,
eaqh visitor bringing offerings for the
orphans, and as the packages of good

Clerk, the late XV. G. Stimson. two years

of County Commissioner a forged order
which pretends to authorize the settle
ment of the taxes for $500. and McCamont
in behalf of the church paid this amount
to Stimson. The latter pocketed the
whole sum and the county never received
a dollar of it. No petition for a com
promise of the taxes was ever presented
to the County "Board and none of its mem
bers had any knowledge of any money
having been paid by the church. The
whole transaction between McCamont

made no inauiries and Stimson got the

not so severe, but Perry Queenan had

Eastern man did m.ost of the leading,
Queenan had him outpointed. Selger

SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 20.â John
L. Means, a well-known mining man of
this section, has died in a Los Angeles
hospital, leaving his mining properties,
amounting to $30,000, to Mrs. Lucy An
drews of San Francisco. Means was an
old-time prospector, who was taken ill
several weeks ago. At the time of his
illness he was poor, despite his rich
possessions, his idea being to hold,, his
mines, which are east of here, until a
higher bidder should arrive from the
East.
As the days went on and, he did not
improve, nor did a buyer appear, he
began to realize that should he die his
ownings would go without the neces
sary assessment work, whijCh would al
low their jumping at' the end of the
year. In order to prevent this he deed
ed his entire ownings to Mrs. Andrews.
Since that time he has died, and now
the San Francisco woman comes into
possession of the estate.

The presentations were, made by Sec
retary Hay. The call was brief, the
visitors desiring merely to- pay their re
spects to the President.
At 2:35 o'clock this afternoon, accom
panied by Secretary Hay and Minister
Bunau-Varilla, the commissioners
called at the White House and were re
ceived by President Roosevelt in the
blue room. . Â¦ â¢
The State Department received to
day a cablegram from United States
Minister Thompson, dated at Petropo
lis yesterday, stating that the Brazilian
Minister for Foreign Affairs had in
formed him that the Brazilian Govern
ment was ready to recognize the new
republic of Panama whenever applica
tion is made in due form.
Embassador Tower from Berlin made
a similar report as to the? attitude of
the German Government toward Pana
ma. It is now evident to the State
Department that there will be no
withholding of recognition by all' the
powers, as their representatives seem
to be convinced of the stability of the
new republic.
After these felicitations the Secretary
and commissioners discussed the future
of the republic. It was pointed out by
the Minister that the Junta felt that it
must first accomplish the mission to
which it was called by the entire people
cf Panama, namely, ratify the treaty,
and that then it would turn its atten
tion to the equally important "though
less immediate" work of establishing a
more usual form of government. The
Secretary expressed deep interest in the
future of the new state.
_ WASHINGTON. Nov. 20.â The com
mission from Panama, accompanied by
the Panama Minister, M. Philippe
Bunau-Varilla, was received at the
State Department to-day by Secretary
Hay. The Exchanges, while informal,
were most cordial and were in English.
Dr. Amador informed the Secretary
that the commissioners had carefully
inspected the Hay-Bunau-Varilla treaty
and desired to take this opportunity of
expressing their entire satisfaction with
its terms. Dr. Amador assured the Sec
retary, that no time would be lpst in its
ratification by the Panama Govern
ment. He then paid a tribute, to the
service which the Panama Minister had
performed in so promptly negotiating
the convention. ...

A dispatch from Los Angeles sayB
that Goldman has been sought by the
Los Ar.Â£-?'.cs police for several months,
lie firct appeared in that city during
the latter part of September and repre
sented himself to be a traveling agent
for a cloak and fur house in New York
Etylcd James 1. Cohen & 'Co. To oth
ers he pretended to represent Ross
Bros, of New York. By a display of
money an<3 credentials alleged to have
been lorsp'i h<Â» secured the confidence
of S. B. r.p.iley, a jeweler on Broadway,
and from him secured a diamond ring
valued at $"00. In payment therefor
he pave a Fight draft on James I. Cohen
& Co. of New York, and having se
cured the ring sn]d it the same <3ay in
a pawn shop for $125. Then he left
town.
He was not heard from ag'ain until
arrested yesterday in this city. He will
be held until a man from Los Angeles
can be sent in take him to the scene of
his thieving operations.
CAUGHT YESTERDAY.
Last August he was arrested again
for an attempt to pasa worthless checks
on Eton Bros, and the Hotel Argyle of
this city. Again he secured his release
by paying' the amount of his bogxis
drafts. All of the drafts were drawn
on the mythical firms in the East he
claimed to be drumming for.
On September 29 last he married in
this city pretty Bonita Hayen. a young
lady of 21. who came of an aristocratic
Cuban family from Havana. The cer
emony was performed much against
the bride's parents' wishes. The two
went to Seattle immediately after the
marriage. They had been there but a
month when Goldman was arrested for
swindling the proprietor of the Hotel
Cecil. His young wife was so over
come with grief that she fell ill and
died a creek later. The physician! at
tributed her death to a broken heart.
The discovery of her husband's crook
edness was more than she could bear.
"While In jail in Seattle Goldman at
tacked a fellow-prisoner with a knife
and another charge was placed against
him. Although wanted at that time
for similar operations in Los AngelÂ£s,
the wily crook again went free after
paying the amounts of his bogus
checks. Owing to a technicality he
could not be extradited to Los Angeles.
ARRESTED IN AUGUST.
Fred M. Goldman, alias Frank Gold
man, alias C. P. Goldman, under arrest
in three cities of the Pacific Coast dur
ing the last six months for the paesing
of spurious checks, was arrested yes
terday afternoon on Haight street by
Detective Taylor, to be detained for
Chief Elton of Los Angeles, who has
a charge of obtaining money under
false pretenses against him.
lie is the same Goldman whose bride
of seven weeks died in Seattle of a
broken heart when she discovered the
true character of the man she had wed
ded, j ,
' Goldman, who posed as a commercial
traveler for mythical houses in the
East, succeeded in passing several
worthless drafts in this city last May.
He claimed to be a drummer for the
glove firm of Richards & Lotus of New
York and also a representative for an
Eastern tobacco house. He passed a
spurious draft on Ottinger, the cut
rate ticket broker, and paid hotel bills
at the Russ, Lick and Palace hotels
with his worthless checks. He was ar
rested on May 4 as he was about to
depart for El Paso. At the time of his
arrest he *vas wanted in Butte. Mont..
and Salt Lake City for forgery. .He
subsequently secured his release by a
technicality, as it could not be proved
there were not such firms in the East
as he claimed to represent.

The rival concern is directing Its
business from San Francisco and has
traveling men in , different sections of

all the products of the concern. They
include candies. As the noliday. orders

bine* to their utmost the inroads, being
made by the Mutual of San Francisco

noticeable, but as soon as the Christ

city that* are now in the combine to
keep up prices will stand together or

cline to. say. They are all desirous of
preventing a cut being made at all,
but admit that something will have, to
be done by January.
PORTLAND, Nov. 20.â Christmas

cracker combine declaring war upon
the firms outside of the trust at once,

schedule of rates being presented to
buyers as soon as the new year arrives.
The Mutual Biscuit Company of San
Francisco is said to have established
a branch house in Portland, but careful
inquiry fails to locate it.
Special - Dispatch to Tha Call.
The place where they claimed to have
been with Hulse is about six blocks
from the scene of the crimÂ«. The wit
nesses giving this evidence are Ed Pot
ter, formerly a streetcar motorman.
and John E. Caldwell, a cattleman
from Linns Valley. Both men are
known to have been stanch friends of
the dead outlaw McKinney, Potter hav
ing known him in boyhood and con
tinually boasted of his friendship for
him up to the time of his death. Both
were arrested after the crime, but re
leased for lack of evidence. The at
torneys for the people closely cross-ex
amined both as to statements they had
made at the time of their arrest, which
were taken down by the official re
porter. To-morrow it is expected that
an effort will be made to introduce evi
dence to impeach them. Several other
witnesses, mostly disinterested citizens
of unimpeachable character, testified to,
having seen Hulse on Chester avenue
a short time after the crime, but it is
maintained by the State that he Jhad
time to get there from the Josshouse
after the shootinsr.
The evidence of all the witnesses who
saw the man near the josshouse sup
posed to have been Hulse is that he
left there before the wounded officers
were taken uptown, the time when
Hulse was seen on the street. The rest
of the evidence Introduced by the de
fense is chiefly of a negative character,
consisting of the statements of a num
ber of persons who were in Baer's drug
store when the dying statement of Tib
bet is said to have been made and who
did not heaf it. To-morrow the prose
cution will introduce evidence in re
buttal.
BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 20.â The at
torneys for the defense in the Hujse
case to-day succeeded in establishing
an alibi for their client by two wit
nesses, who, if their testimony ia to be
believed, met Hulse In the Crawford
saloon, on Chester avenue, about twen
ty minutes before the fatal battle at
the Josshouse and were in his com
pany continuously up to the time the
wounded officers were brought down
town for treatment.
Sptcial Dispatch ?Â» The C&1L
SAN JOSE, Nov. 20.â The sensational
divorce suit of Eugene T. Russell
against Laura E. Russell was decided
to-day, when Mrs. Russell was granted
a decree on a counter complaint charg
ing her husband with cruelty. Clarence
T. Urmy, the well-known poet and
musician, was named as a co-respond
ent in the husband's complaints. Rus
sell, who is a traveling man, formerly
had his home in Idaho, and claimed
that Urmy's verse had been the means
of enticing his wife away from her
home, and wrecking his happiness. A
couple of years ago Mrs. Russell came
to this city irom her home in Idaho, to
live with her mother, Mrs. Mary T.
Spangler, and to study music. She was
a pupil of Urmy's. After a while Rus
sell induced his wife to return" to Idaho
and everything was progressing lovely
until one day he went home and found
his wife reading a poem by Urmy in
one of the magazines, and which de
fendant claimed Mrs. Russell said ap
pealed to her to return to San Jose.
Before tha case came to trial Rus
sell was charged by his mother-in-law,
Mrs^-Spangler, with perjury, in that he
had falselysworn in the complaint that
he was a resident of this city. Russell
disappeared, and the officers have
never been able to locate him to place
him under arrest.
Mrs. Russpll filed a cross-complaint
denying all - the charges made by her
husband, and asking for a divorce on
the ground of cruelty. The couple had
been married about ten years, and
there were no children or community
property to dispute over. Russell made
no defense to the cross complaint, for
had he appeared on the scene he would
have been arrested on the perjury
charge.
Special' Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Novi 20.â Gim Sing, a
Chinese mine owner, worth $250,000, be
ing the wealthiest Individual "of any
race in Trinity County, was killed on
Thursday by a cave-in at one of his
placer mines in Eastman Gulch, in
Trinity County. The, body had not been
recovered this evening. One of Sing's
laborers was killed at the same time.
A third man, a Chinese laborer, was
held by the debris all day Thursday,
but his head 1 was out, so he was not
suffocated and is found to be not seri
ously hurt. A fourth Chinaman start
ed on horseback this morning to Lew
iston, a distance of four miles, to tele
phone to Weaverville : for the Coroner
and physicians. En route the horse
he was riding slipped on the trail and
rolled sixty feet down the steep moun
;tainslde, ; crippling the rider.
The trouble resulted from Gim Sing,
who visited' the Eastman Gulch prop
erty Thursday morning, desiring a
crew of twenty Chinamen to repair a
flume at a point one mile from camp
where it passes through a cut In gravel
twenty feet deep. Owing to recent se
vere storms loosening the gravel all
but two men were afraid of just such
an accident as happened. So the two
employes started to work unaided. They
had hardly more than started when a
hundred yards of the twenty-foot bank
fell in, killing two and partially cover
ing one. Their fate was not known un
; til that, night, when; their failure to re
turn caused an investigation. The
courier who rolled down the mountain
side was not so severely injured but
that he could crawl into Lewiston to
day and have the message telephoned.

His fellow-commissioners and other
members of his party believe that the
general Is inclined to accept the situa
tion.
The excitement at Barranqullla and
Cartagena and along the river is sub
siding. There was great excitement,
however, during the passage of the
Canada, as the people believed that
General Reyes and his companions
were bent on a warlike mission. There
is more excitement to-day at Barran
qullla than anywhere else, but It is re
ported the people everywhere are be
ginning to view the situation 'philo
sophically.
The reports emanating from Buena
Ventura of the conditions in the de
partments of Cauca and Antloquia. ap
pear to have been exaggerated. The
last reports from these departments do
not .bear out the sensational stories.
Senor Bustamente is the Liberal lead
er and Senor Ospina is the Conservative
leader of Antioquia. There has been a
limited discussion on the part of the
Liberal and other discontents In An
tioquia and Cauca- of . inaugurating a
revolutionary movement Such talk
may be expected at any time in almost
any department of Colombia. The Lib
eral revolutionary party is still strong
and Panama's success was bound to
stimulate such talk.
During the trip down the Magdalena
River General Reyes was everywhere
received with enthusiasm. The people
told him they were ready and willing to
enlist in a fight for the recovery of the
isthmian territory- General Reyes al
ways discouraged this warlike attitude,
declaring it better to act through dip
lomatic channels, which he told the
people was the purpose of his mission
to the isthmus.
It Is reported on good authority that
General Reyes countermanded prepara
tions which were being made in Buena
Ventura and Earranquilla for a march
on the isthmus. The general, no doubt,
recognized the futility of any such
tempt in view of the protection given
hy the United States to the new re
public.
General Reyes la to-day the strongest
and most intelligent feature in the re
public of Colombia. He Is very popu
lar and it is believed that the course of
the government of Colombia in the
isthmian matter will be very greatly
influenced by whatever attitude Gen
eral Reyes may decide to take.
STOBIES NOT BOBNE OUT.
The power with which he is vested
was conferred on him by President
Marroquin. .
General Reyes is what is termed lo
cally "President in campaign of Co
lombia."
The Colombian commissioners asked
permission to disembark for a. prome
nade through the streets of Colon. Gov
ernor Melendez communicated the re
quest to the Junta, and it was promptly
granted.
Then the Panaman and Colombian
commissioners left the Canada togeth
er and, arm in arm, they walked to the
end of the dock, where a hundred sol
diers of the new republic formed in two
lines and presented arms. As the com
missioners passed through the lines
drums were beaten and bugles sound
ed. The members of the party then
seated themselves in rickety carriages
and drove through Colon unguarded,
and returned to the Canada after an
hour. In every way the. Colombian
generals were treated as distinguished
foreigners.
The questions of Colombia's recogni
tion of the republic of Panama and Co
lombia's possible equity in the canal,
railroad and other interests on the isth.
mus were not broached.
The conference ot the commissioners
was continued informally this after
noon, when a document was drawn up
and signed by all the commissioners,
setting forth the details of the confer
ence. General Holguin of the Colom
bian commission asked, finally, if the
Colombians could do anything what
ever to regain the isthmus, and Senor
Arias answered trÂ«t it was. decidedly
and absolutely impossible. He, how
ever, expressed the desire of the isth
mians for close and friendly relations
with Colombia.
General Reyes, who was a candidate
for the Presidency of Colombia, issued
a decree dated at Barranqullla, Novem
ber 16. addressed to the members of the
electoral college at Bogota, which said:'
"Haying accepted a military mission,
empowered with all presidential facul
ties in almost all departments of the
republic, at a moment when my coun
try is preparing for a Presidential elec
tion, I deem It my duty to relinquish
my candidacy. Hence, I renounce ir
revocably, offering my services to my
country in other positions."
General Reyes' attitude Thursday
night, as indicated by his remarks, was
more or less bellicose. Though still
bellicose, he Is more hopeful to-day.
He seems disturbed, however, by the
rapid march of events in the United
States and Is fearful that Congress may
ratify the canal treaty with the new
republic. He appears despondent over
the general outlook of his "mission.

entitled "A Narrative of a Trip
Through the White Mountains of New
Hampshire." by Albert J. Le Breton,
at the Alhambra Theater last night.
The lecture was under the auspices of
the California Camera Club, of which
Mr. Le Breton is a member. The lec
turer announced that the scenery of
the mountains, slides of which were
remarkably perfect, was not unlike
English mountain and lake scenery.
The White Mountains, he said, were
not as Imposing and majestic as the
peaks nt the Yosemite and Canadian
Rockies, but, said Mr. Le Breton, they
had one advantage over themâ they
were more frequently visited by the
400 and have been in society longer.
The lecture throughout was Instructive
and humorous.

TACOMA, Wash.. Nov. 20.â The re
cent tungsten ore swindle at Skagway
had its ending yesterday at Sitka when
J. R. Rollins, its promoter, was sen
tenced by Judge Brown of the Alaska
District Court to two and one-half
years' imprisonment at the McNeil Isl
and penitentiary near Tacoma. Rollins
pleaded guilty to two counts of ob
taining money under false pretenses
and was sentenced on one count alone.
Judge Brown stated that additional
sentence would probably be rendered
on the other count later in the week.
Rollins represented to Rkagway busi
ness men that he found a mine of
tungsten ore along the White Pass
Railway and that fortunes would ac
crue to everybody who held stock in
it. He sold a number of adjoining
claims, also supposed to contain tung
sten. According to his story, the Krupp
gun works and Carnegie Steel Com
pany both wanted tungsten ore at high
prices for use in manufacturing armor
plate. He accordingly had 100 tons of
the supposed ore shipped to the Skag
way wharf for shipment to Pittsburg,
exhibiting telegrams purporting to
show that the ore had been bought at
fancy prices. One of the Investors sent
samples of the ore away for analysis,
thug exposing the swindle. Rollins'
wife accompanied him to Sitka.

The fire is supposed to have started
in the scenery back of the stage of the
theater. The losses to the tenants will
be heavier than ordinary, owing to the
high insurance rate due to the construc
tion of the building and because it con
tained a theater. There were seven acts
on at the theater this week and the
people presenting them lost their effects.
The theater is owned by Colonel John
D. Hopkins of St Louis. The building,
which was, erected In 1864, is a total
loss. At one time It was the principal
theater of Louisville. Nearly $40,000 in
improvements has been spent on it re
cently.

that as a result of the conference yes

Lansdowne a . perfect accord was
reached between Great Britain and

politics.
LONDON, Nov. 20.â The visit of the
Italian sovereigns to England practi
cally terminated to-night with a ban
quet to the monarchs and their suites
in St. George's Hall, Windsor Castle.
In spite of the fact that eighty-six per

quiet and almost a family affair. There
were no speeches, but the conversation
was cordial.
In view of the announcement of the
result of the conference yesterday be

SIgnor Tittoni, and the British Secre
tary of Foreign Affairs, Lord Lans

that the tariff Question will not be dls

The conclusion was reached at the end

WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â The Senate
held its longest sitting of the session to
day, beginning at noon and concluding at
3:15 d. m. The entire time was consumed
in debating a motion to refer the Cuban
reciprocity bill to the Committee on For
cien Relations. The political line was
sharply drawn in the discussion, the Re
publicans advocating such reference and
the Democrats contending that the meas
ure should go to the Committee on Fi

In view of this announcement of the

ers.
The suggestion "was first made by
Senator Kelley (D.) of Texas that the
Finance Committee of the Senate
should take the bill, report it next
Wednesday and then the Senate and
House would adjourn until December,
when the regular session begins.
When this suggestion was laid before
the leaders of the House to-day there
was an emphatic protest. The proposi
tion was indorsed by some of the old
time Senate leaders, many of whom
have three times defeated reciprocity.
They all wanted to go home for
Thanksgiving. Meantime the Demo
cratic Senate leaders v/ere Influenced
to call a caucus and see if the minority
party would not also agree. The posi
tion as expressed by Speaker Cannon
was that the House had discharged its
own duty and It would not be a party
to any further delay. He said such an
adjournment as proposed would be an
insult to the President and a slap at
the Republican party.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. â With a re

Two bold hold-ups occurred in the

night. They were the last of a series

The present trial began last Monday
morning. The Jury retired shortly after
3 o'clock this afternoon, and rendered
its verdict after deliberating six hours.
It is understood that a majority was
for acquittal from the start, and that
It took some time to go over all the
documents that had been submitted In
evidence before a unanimous verdict
was reached. It Is generally under
stood there was doubt as to Miller's
connection with the transactions be
tween Johns and Ryan. The Govern
ment officials state that this case was
not like any of other postal cases
that are pending, as this case simply
dealt with the action of Miller when he

suppressed by the court officers. As
soon as court was adjourned and Judge

ment of agriculture of the University
of California had been requested to
rive an informal talk and his remarks,
drawn from a fund of experience, were
full of Interest for the ladies, who
have the beautifying of the city at
heart. He said that the planting or
sidewalk trees Bhould be a public work
and should be subject to supervision in
order to prevent Irregularity in the
kinds of trees chosen and also In their
arrangement. Evergreen trees, he said,
should not be planted in streets run
ning east and west, as the shade kept
the streets from drying up as rapidly
as they otherwise would In the rainy
season. Professor Stubenrauch gave
the committee a list of trees that might
be desirable for civic planting, the first
choice being the European white birch.
Mrs. Cora E. Jones is chairman of

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Nov. 20.
That the residence of Julius Seul
berger, the well-known florist, at 164
Athol avenue was not destroyed by fire
Wednesday night, is due to the presence
of mind and quick action of Fred Seul
berger, the son of the owner of the
house.
On the evening mentioned the family
were all absent at the German Ladies'
Relief Society ball. Before leaving the
house Miss Daisy Seulberger had used
a small coal oil lamp to heat a pair of
curling irons, and in her haste forgot
to extingush the lamp and left It burn
ing on a stand near a partly open win
dow. After the family had left the
house the wind must have blown the
lace curtain against the lamp, Knock
ing the chimney to the floor, where it
was found broken, and setting fire to
the curtain, which blazed up and set
the window frame on fire.
The blaze was just gaining headway
when the son. who had returned home
before the rest of the family, entered
the house. He at once attacked the
fire, and after a hard struggle , Suc
ceeded lh extinguishing it. In the bat

hands were painfully burned.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
"The Southern Pacific Company does
not intend to charge fares between its
local stations. There is absolutely no
truth in the report that it would do
bo. It has never been discussed and has
never even been thought of."
Superintendent Palmer's positive lan
guage sets at rest all rumors as to the
company's future intentions and a good
many people, who use its line, but do
not travel on the new one, will be
pleased to know that they can enjoy the
free riding privilege awhile longer.
The rumor that the Southern Pacific
Company would charge fares on its
Berkeley local trains between stations
turns out to have been made without
authority. The company will continue
to carry free the people who prefer to
ride on the new ferry line and pay their
transportation to it. No less a persona
age than W. S. Palmer, division super
intendent of the Southern Pacific Com
pany on this side of the bay, denies that
the big corporation intends to make its
rival's passengers pay. Here is what

The heirs are Sally McKee Pierce, the
surviving widow; Henrietta Watkinson
and Josephine Pierce, ' sisters of de
ceased. What the share of each will
be cannot be determined at present, as
It will depend upon how much of the
estate is declared to be community
property and how much the deceased's
separate property. Of the community
property the widow -will receive three
fourths and the sisters one-fourth, di
vided between them. Of his separate
property the widow will get one-half
and his sisters a half divided between
them.
Among the documents left by the late
Orestes Pierce nothing in the form of a
will has been discovered and to-day
two papers were filed with the County
Clerk in regard to the disposition of the
estate. A request was filed, signed by
Sally McKee Pierce, decedent's widow,
asking that Sam Bell McKee be ap
pointed administrator of the estate.
Accompanying this was McKee's peti
tion, stating that there was no will and
giving in brief the character of the
property and the names of the heirs.
According to the petition, the estate
consists of stock in the Willamette
Pulp and Paper Company, of which the
decedent was president; stock in the
San Francisco National Bank and other
corporations, bonds and promissory
notes and real estate. The value of the
property, it is said, exceeds $10,000, and
conservative estimates by men con
nected in business transactions with
the deceased state that it Will reach
$500,000.

During the two months Miss Lanigan
acted as housekeeper, "Widower Neeley,
she claimed, proposed marriage to her
and was accepted. But the recently
bereaved husband insisted the engage
ment should be kept a secret until the
year of mourning had passed. At the
expiration of the twelve months Nee
ley, according to the plaintiff, refused
to wed her. Hence the suit.
The trial had been on for two weeks.
Arguments were concluded late this
afternoon and the case was submitted
to the Jury shortly before .6 o'clock.
The fair plaintiff that recovered thi3
substantial verdict had a long story of
mfsplaced affections to tell as the basis
of her claims against the aged capital
ist. Miss Lanigan declared that her
family and that of Neeley had been
close friends for forty years. When
Neeley's wife was stricken with what
proved to be a fatal illness, Miss Lani
gan went as a nurse into the Neeley
home until her death.
Afterward, Miss Lanigan said, she ar
ranged to return to the residence in San
Francisco of Mrs. Katherine Dougher
ty, her mother, but Neeley prevailed
upon her to remain at his hou3e until he
could straighten out his domestic af
fairs.
A Jury to-night in the Superior Court
gave a verdict In $8000 in favor of Miss
Mary Lanigan, who sued David Neeley,
a well-to-do Berkeley nurseryman, for
alleged breach of promise, an 8-months
old child figuring in the case.

"While Horn may have committed
many crimes during his long experience
as a range detective for the cattle
men, there is one thing that I may say
for him, and that is he was as game a
man as ever lived."
William Pinkerton vouched for the
courage of Tom.Horn, for he had tried
the frontiersman and found him true.
It was while discussing with a number
of friends at the Palace Hotel last
evening the hanging of Horn yesterday
that the well-known detective, who has
been in this city for several days, made
xeference to the man's bravery.

AIRSHIP STRIKES
AND EXPLODES
Armstrong killed his sweetheart, Min
nie Ensminger, on Christmas night of
last year, shooting the girl twice. When
on trial he confessed the crime.
SALEM, Or., . Nov. ' 20.â Because
Pleasant Armstrong, the confessed
murderer of Mianle Ensminger, waa
not hanged In Baker County under the
warrant of execution Issued March 31,
it is now possible he will escape the
gallows altogether. This Â¦ comes about
through the Interpretation of the law
given by Attorney. General Crawford.
Armstrong was sentenced' March 31,
but an appeal was taken and the death
penalty was not carried out. While
the matter was before the Supreme
Court the new law became operative
requiring that the death sentence be
carried out at the State prison here.
Armstrong: having been originally sen
tenced under the old law now prevents
him being punished under the new,
while the new law is held xo preclude
the possibility of his meeting death
under the former sentence, as the date
has expired and the prisoner would
have to be condemned a second time.
Habeas corpus proceedings are to be-'
gin at Baker City to release Armstrong
from the jail where he has been con
fined for almost a year.
The choice of death by shooting or
hanging is given the condemned in
Utah, and Mortensen chose to mee,t his
death by the bullets of the prison
guards.
PROFIT IN NEW
TARIFF BILL
Hay left his house shortly after din
ner that evening, stating he was going
to Mortensen's to collect some money.
That was the last seen of him alive.
December IS Hay's body was found
buried in a shallow grave in the middle
of a pasture not far from Mortensen's
house. A bullet-hole through the head
showed the manner of death. Morten
sen was immediately arrested.
Soon afterward Mrs. Mortensen left
Salt Lake with her children without
calling on her husband to say good-by.
The laws of Utah do not permit a wife
to testify against her husband, but it
was learned that Mrs. Mortensen con
sidered him guilty of the murder, be
cause of the fact that he had gone out
with Hay that night and remained over
an hour. When he returned he was
ghastly pale and cautioned his wife
not to tell any one he had left the
house.
A strong chain of circumstantial evi
dence was wound around Mortensen at
the trial and he was pronounced guilty
on the first ballot. The most sensa
tional incident of the trial was the
testimony of James Sharp. Hay's
father-in-law, who stated that he knew
on the night before the body was dis
covered that Hay had been murdered
by Mortensen. because '"God had re
vealed it to him." This so-called
"revelation" testimony was made the
basis of an appeal to the Supreme
Court for a new trial, which, however,
was denied, the jurors stating that
this had not influenced their decision in
any way.
This was the first legal execution In
Utah for seven years. Mortensen was
Fhot to death for the murder of James
R- Hay on the night of December 16,
390L The day following a report was
circulated that Hay, who was secre
tary of the Pacific Lumber Company,
had absconded, taking with him 53800
collected from Mortensen on a bill due
the company. Mortensen was indebted
to the company for material used in
his contracting business and had been
urged to make a payment. On Decem
ber 16 he called at the office of the com
pany, said lie had the money in gold
concealed in his cellar and asked Hay
to come around that night and get it.
The men were neighbors.
Mortrnsen refused to see ministers,
either of his own belief, the Mormon,
or any other denomination, and also
refused stimulants, saying he needed
neither.
Mortcnsca waa killed Instantly, the
four bullets from thÂ« rifles of the exe

Squad of Executioners Fire
From Behind a Heavy
Curtain*
In Just sixteen minutes after the
drop Horn was pronounced dead by a
physician and his body taken down.
It was turned over to Charles Horn, a
brother of the dead man, and taken
by him to Boulder, Colo., for burial.
Tom Horn was born in Scotland
County, Mo., November 21. 1860. He
was a celebrated army scout, Indian
fighter and cattle detective. He was
the scout in charge of the party that
captured Geronlmo and was chief of
scouts under General Miles in his Por
to Rico campaign. In 1892 Horn par
ticipated in the raid against the cattle
rustlers of Johnson County, Wvo.
Horn was a self-educated man. He
spoke German, Spanish, Apache and
a number of Indian languages fluently.
Last summer he wrote a 160,000-word
history of his career. This book he left
to h!s stanch friend, John C. Coble of
Bosler, Wyo.
Horn was suspected of having com
mitted several murders besides the one
for which he was hanged.
There was no answer. The specta
tors passed out, each shaking hands
with Proctor and commending him for
the faultless execution.
noose.
Dr. Rafter prayed earnestly for the
salvation of the departing soul.
Proctor took up the black cap and
slipped it over the doomed man's head
and in this he was asisted by Horn's
movements of the neck.
Cahill and Smalley lifted Horn on
the trapdoor. Instantly water began
to run from the tank and in fifty sec
onds the trap fell.
"He sure died game," said Charlie
Irwin a minute later.
The condemned man coolly ducked
his head and thrust it through the
Proctor picked up the noose at 11:05
o'clock and started to place It over
Horn's head.
"What's the matter, Joe? (to Cahill,
who was rubbing his chin nervously.)
Ain't losing your nerve, are you?"
HELPS THE EXECUTIONER.
"I'll have to have a hand to get on
that thing," said Horn with a ghastly
smile.
Horn's hands were then securely
pinioned to his body and he was all
ready for the final strap on his feet.
Between Smalley. Proctor and Cahill
he walked out on the platform with
short steps and stood looking at the
noose.
"Well, Tom, a man's got to die only
Â¦ once, and it has to be, so be game.'"
"You bet I will."
"It's as well first as last, you know."
"Yes; it's all right."
"Well, good-by, old man. I wish I
could do something for you. Is there
anything you want me to do?"
"No, I wrote Coble this morning."
"Good-by."
"Good-by."
The two Irwins passed around back
to the lower floor in the front, where
they were within five feet of the drop.
Proctor began to fasten the straps.
Horn turned and twisted to suit the
executioner.
"Well. Joe," he said to Cahill, "I hear
you are married and doing well; that,
you are County Clerk. Is that so?"
"Yes, Tom, it's true," answered Ca
hill.
"Well, I'm glad to hear it."
"Tom." said Charlie, "did you make a
confession to the murder of Willie
Nickel?"
"No." /
Charlie and Frank Irwin then sang
that old cowboy railroad song. "Keep
Tour Hand Upon the Throttle and
Tour Eye Upon the Rail."
The rich yet untrained voices of the
two brothers rang through the corridors
and brought tears to the eyes of the
spectators. When the song was fin
ished Proctor said:
"Charles and Frank Irwin will pass
around to the left and come above."
"Thank you, Ed," said Tom, and the
two brothers were on the balcony In
another moment.
COWBOY SONGS FOB. H0B.N.
"Hello, Tom," said Irwin, with a
pleasant smile and a wave of his hand.
"Hi, Charlie," answered Horn with a
smile.
"Charlie Irwln will sing." said Proc
tor, as Horn neared the edge of the bal
cony and looked down.
Horn Â«rot up off his couch and walked
out of the door. He was pale and thin
from long confinement, but he was
same.
"Ain't losing your nerve, are you.
Joe?" said Horn. Then the cap was
adjusted and he stood with clenched
flats Trailing for the drop.
When tho spectators had been ad
mitted to the Jail the Rev. GÂ«orge H.
Rafter climbed up a ladder to the tier
la which Horn was confined and opened
a prayer-book. The massive Iron doors
opened as Under Sheriff Proctor, Sheriff
Smaller, Cour.ty Clerk Joseph Cahill
and Deputy Sheriff Leslie Snow ap
peared.
PTank and Charles Irwln sang a sen
timental cowboy song and were allowed
to shake hands with Horn. Horn's last
word was to Joseph Cahill, County
Clerk, who assisted on the scaffold.
CHETENXE, Wya, Nov. 26.â Tom
Horn died at 11:0$ a. m., game to the
last and smiling. His neck was broken
by the frJl of the trap* ,
Horn <tenied that he had ever con
fessed the murder of Willie Nickel, but
told his spiritual advisers he had been
guUty cf crimes, but not willfully so.
Ten minutes before he was bound for
the scaffold he lay on his cot smoking
a eignr and looking out at the specta
tors.
"When the war broke out Horn re
ceived an order from General Miles to
organize a squadron of packers, and he
gathered together a picked lot of cow
boys and Indians, who reported to him
to St. Louis, where they were fitted out
and finally shipped to Cuba. There they
remained until the end of the war, do
ing good service. Horn returned to
New York an invalid from yellow fever
and broken down in health and he was
sent to a hospital in Montauk, L. I.. It
was there my brother, Robert, found
him, and after securing his release, had
him sent back to the West.
"While a deputy United States Mar
shal, engaged In ridding the Western
cattle ranges of its desperate bands of
rustlers, Horn showed himself to be a
most courageous fellow, never faltering
for a moment in the face of the great
est danger. He was credited with 're
moving' forty or fifty of the worst of
the men who were engaged in the
stealing of cattle. Some say that men
who undertake this kipd of work are
not particularly game, but I will say
that Horn was game, although I do not
approve of his methods of getting rid of
objectionable characters.
"On my way out to San Francisco
this time I stopped off at Cheyenne
with my nephew apd tried to see Horn
at the Jail. I felt that the least that I
could do, knowing that he was about to
be hanged, would be to call on him and
bid him good-by and give him a few
cigars or some other comforting arti
cle, but they told me that no one was
allowed to visit him. When I first saw
Horn he was a stalwart fellow, weigh
ing over 200 pounds, but they told me
at the Jail the other day that he had
fallen away to less than 165 pounds and
had become emaciated from long con
finement Drink waa his ruin. Had he
abstained from liquor, Tom Horn,. ln-_
stead of going to the gallows to-day,
would have lived to enjoy a reputation
that few men can boast of."
"At night they raided the place and
captured one McCoy, whom they
strapped on a horse, and riding back
twenty-five miles the prisoner was put
aboard a train In charge of Shores and
conveyed to Colorado. Horn went back
to the shack alone to % capture 'Peg-
Leg/ and after a wait of thirty-six
hours was gratified in sighting his man
approaching across the prairie. When
the horseman came within shooting
distance Horn covered him, and a few
minutes later 'Peg-Leg' was a captive.
As had been done with the robber's
pal, Horn put his man on a horse and
again made tracks for the railroad,
where he caught a train and without
a warrant succeeded in getting his
prisoner back Into Colorado.
"Later, Horn went south and cap
tured another of the gang, all of whom,
by the way, are now serving life terms
in the penitentiary in Detroit. Unfor
tunately, Horn got to drinking and I
was forced to threaten him with dis
missal if he did not quit. The last time
I saw him we'were bound westward on
a train, he for Ogden and I for this
city. He was drinking then and I told
him that it was his last chance and
that instructions had been left by me in
Denver to dismiss him if he showed up
drunk again.
"Shores took quite a fancy to Horn,
and It was on tho recommendation of
the former that Horn finally secured
employment with our agency In Den
ver. I remember distinctly fourteen
years ago I saw Horn for the first time
In Denver, when he came In from Ari
zona for a job. He was a big, loose-
Jointed fellow, with long dark hair and
a sort of Indian cast of features, that
attracted my attention. After a short
trial we sent him to the ranges, and he
did good work there. It was not, how
ever, until the McCoy gang held up
the De'nver and Rio Grande train In
the Wet Mountains, near the Utah
border, that Horn was given. a chance
to prove his gameness. Bands of men
were roaming the country in all direc
tions looking for the notorious robbers,
but, as is usually the case In such cir
cumstances, they were accomplishing
little good. We finally decided to dis
patch Horn to the front, and he sent
for his friend Shores. Together they
started on the trail of the McCoys, and
with their experience as woodsmen
were soon close on the gang, which
they had trailed across Colorado, Kan
sas and into the Indian Territory. One
day they came upon a shack in which
they discovered that 'Peg-Leg' and an
other of the McCoys were putting up
with several Cherokee Indians.

In full knowledge of the fact that for
years he traveled about a marked man.
He began his remarkable career on th*
borders of the Western Territories, and
eventually, as a scout under General
Crook and later under General Miles,
he proved himself a valuable man to
the Government. "With Sheriff Shores
of Gunnison, Colo., Horn played an Im
portant part In the capture of Geron
imo, and later made a splendid reputa
tion for himself In running down some
of the worst criminals the "West ever
knew.

true to nature; a treat indeed for the fortunate young folks who will visit the big store to-day, Â»and the Â«
older people are going to have a good time, too. '

Justice of the Peace Van Nostrand's
court ln the expectation of seeing Mrs.
Mande Waters try on- a dress made by
Miss ; "lf. Ostrander, a dressmaker,
which the former declared did* not fit.
On that account Mrs. Waters had re
fused,* to pay $C5 75 balance dufe on the
dregs arid Miss Ostrander sued her for
the amount. . . : .
â¢ Mrs. Waters had declared her inten
tlori to array herself in the suit to show
that it was a bad fit. The curiosity
seekers, however, were disappointed, as
Mrs.* Waters' attorney announced that
his client had changed her mind and
would not try on the dress. On that
showing Judge Van Nostrand was con
strained to give Judgment In favor of
AIlss Ostrander, who averred that the
dress was a perfect fit.

that the list of names to whom no

lands within the State of California, Issued
or granted by the United States Â¦ of America,
shall contain a statement of the date of the
location of a claim or 'Claims upon which the
granting or issuance of such patent ls based,
such statement shall be prima facie evidence
of the data of such location.
In accordance with the recommenda
tions of the proper committee two bills
have been drawn to provide that all
patents for mineral lands hereafter
contain a statement of the date of the
location of the claims. The first sec
tion of the proposed State law is as
follows: . . yT'^
In view of these facts the committee
recommended that Instead of any long
er continuing to urge the appointment
of a Secretary of Mines and Mining,
which it seems impossible to obtain at
this time, it should be urged upon Con
gress to create a distinct and separate
bureau under the Secretary of the In
terior or the Secretary of Commerce
and Industry, which will have full
charge of collections of mineral statis
tics of the country, and also of all mat
ters relating to the entire mineral in
dustry, the head official of which shall
be known as the Commissioner of
Mines and Mining. . . ;,,-,
TEXT OF NEW BILL.
When the United States Geological Survey
was formed they began about 18S2 to collect
figures of products of all mineral substances
except the precious metals. This has since
continued. That la. there are two depart
ments of the Government, one working 1 on
gold and silver, and the other on other min
eral substances of which there are ln all sixty.
This work, could as well be done by one de
partment, and ln fact better results, would
accrue.
It rhould be stated that in 186", and up to
1S76. the United States had a United States
Commissioner of Mining Statistics, but as the
industry was at that time of comparatively
little Importance, the office was abolished ln
1ST6. and nothing regarding the mining in
dustry was published by the Government un
til in 1S80 when the matter of collecting sta
tistics was turned over to the Director of the
Mint. Even then he obtained figures for gold
and silver only.

The four suits In favor of Roman
Catholic charitable institutions, which
have been pending, against Mrs. Belle
W. Sprague, . former wife of the late
J. Mervyn Donahue, were settled out of
court yesterday. By the terms of the
agreement Mrs. Sprague has agreed to
pay to Archbishop Riordan $16,000. The
original amount Involved represented
$21,969 68. "When the settlement was
announced the two suits pending in the
Superior Court and the one in the
United States District Court were" at
once dismissed. ?
The suits involved ' were as follows:
(a) By ArchblshoD Riordan for dis
tribution among the Catholic char
itable institutions of San Fran- Â¦
Cisco $15,151 61
(b) By the Roman Catholic Orphan
Asylum at South San Francisco.. 3,030 30
(c) By St. Vincent's Orphan Asy
- lum at Sah Rafael 3,030 30
(c) By St. Joseph's Infant Asylum
at San Francisco 757^57
Total $21,060 6S
The bequests were all made in the
will of the late J. Mervyn Donahue and
the dispute arose out of two contracts
made by Mrs. Sprague. Mrs. Sprague's
contracts were in writing, signed by
her brother, Ryland T. "Wallace. Mrs.
Sprague resisted the payment of the
money on the ground that there was no
consideration for the agreements and
that her brother had no authority to
act as her attorney, as he did not have
the power at the time the contracts
were Issued.
At the trial "Wallace swore that he
issued the contracts when his sister,
Mrs. Sprague, was in the State, and i
when he had no power of attorney to
act for her. He claimed that the con
tracts were issued between April and
September, 1893. In contradiction to
this Attorney testified that
the agreement was issued between Jan- |
uary 3 and February 19, 1S94, and he
produced the following letters between
himself and Archbishop Riordan to sub
stantiate his testimony:
Et. Mary'Â« Cathedral, ilOO Franklin street, San
Francisco, Cal.. Dec. 29. 1893.
Dr. Mr. McEnerney: The document which
I wish to have is not the one you send me,
but a contract drawn up between Mr. Hayes
and Ryland Wallace In reference to the dis
tribution of ?2T>,000 agreed on between them.
Have the kindness to look this up and send
it to me. Truly yours, P. W. RIORDAN.

Applicants for positions as teachers
in the Los Angeles schools have re
cently attempted to secure certificates
on the strength of the possession of
credentials from other States. The
matter was referred to Attorney Gen
eral "Webb,, who says that applicants
holding county certificates from other
sections of California may be set at
work pending action by the Board of
Education, but that outsiders are not
eligible until they have been so de
clared by the proper autnorltles in this
State.
Superintendent of Public Instruction
Thomas Kirk has asked If the recently
enacted "high school law" means that
one-third of the annual appropriation
shall be divided among all the high
schools In the State according to num
ber or, whether cities where there are
more than one such institution shall
be given credit for one high school only.
The Attorney General states that
where the high schools have been sep
arately established each shall receive
its apportionment. San Francisco, Los
Angeles and Oakland will be particu
larly benefited by this decision. "Where
there are two branches of a high school
the institution will get but one share
of the appropriation.
The Attorney General alsj declared
yesterday that the Supervisors of Plu
mas County are not entitled to mileage
while acting as road commissioners of
their respective districts. It Is held
that the Supervisors* salaries are in
full compensation for all services ren
dered, In accordance with provisions of
the county government act of 1901.
The Political Code would permit of the
collection of mileage by Supervisors
while serving as road commissioners,
but the later law is considered by the
Attorney General to have repealed con
flicting sections of the former* provis
ions. It Is also declared, incidentally,
that the members of the Board of Edu
cation of Plumas County are not en
titled to mileage.
There â¢was no allegation that John
Nelson committed murder or man
slaughter, merely that he was convict
ed of manslaughter and acquitted of
murder. There was no allegation that
David knew John, or that John had
committed any murder or manslaught
er, but simply that.it was known that
John had been charged with murder
and acquitted and convicted of man
slaughter. The information was fatal
ly defective, even if it had been ac
companied by an indictment, and even
In that event the writ would.be grant
ed and the prisoner discharged.
In the present case a demand had
been made, but It was not accompanied
by an indictment nor an affidavit made
before a magistrate and certified to by
the ' Governor. There was stmply an
Information filed by the District At
torney containing a copy of the infor
mation against John Nelson and sworn
to as true.
The Judge in giving his decision went
fully into the provisions of the extradi
tion laws and numerous decisions upon
points raised. It was essential, he said,
that certain facts must be shown* to
exist before the Governor of the State
where the prisoner was arrested should
issue a warrant of extradition. It
must be substantially shown that an
indictment had been found against the
prisoner or an affidavit made before a
magistrate that an offense had been
charged against the prisoner and the
affidavit certified to as authentic by the
Governor of the demanding State.
INFORMATION ALONE.
A requisition had been made for his
return on a charge of being an ac
cessory to a murder, but If there was
anything he might be charged with it
would be as an accessory to the crime
of manslaughter, John Nelson having
been acquitted of the crime of murder.
Assistant District Attorney Harris
argued that as John Nelson had been
charged with the crime of murder and
had been convicted of manslaughter,
taking all the circumstances into con
sideration, there was sufficient in the
papers to warrant the prisoner being
remanded.
REQUISITION MADE
Attorneys Barnes and McCloskey rep
resented Nelson, and when the case
was called yesterday they argued that
no public offense was charged In the
papers submitted for Nelson's extradi
tion.
The argument on the application for
a writ of habeas corpus for the release
of David R. Nelson, an attorney of
Coffeyvllle, Kans., was heard by Judge
Cook yesterday, and the Judge granted
tbÂ« writ and ordered thÂ« prisoner re
leased from custody.
Nelson was arrested about two wÂ«Â«ks
ago on a circular from Sheriff Andy
Pruit of Montgomery County, Kansas,
that ha was wanted there on a felony
charge. It developed later that the
charge was for being an accessory
after tha fact to murder. Nelson's
brother, John, was tried on a charge
of murder in Coffeyvllle and was con
victed of manslaughter. Nelson was
accused of hiding his brother from of
f.eers of the law.
Charles Querbock, alias Charles
George Smith, by the verdict of a Cor
oner's Jury, rendered yesterday, was
formally charged with the murder of
Mrs. Annie Wilson, whose dead body
was found on November 1 lying bruised
and bleeding on trfe floor of her resi
dence, No. 6 Capp street.
The case 13 one of strone circum
stantial evidence connecting Smith
with the injuries sustained by the
woman, but the autopsy by Morgue
Surgeon Luigi D. Baclgalupi showed
that the beating and kicking did not
Inflict sufficient Injuries to cause death.
The "heart, liver and kidneys of the
decedent were diseased, and it was the
opinion of Dr. Bacigalupl that heart
disease had killed her, death being has
tened by the fright and the shock. Fol
lowing ls the verdict as brought by
the Coroner's Jury:
"That the said Annie "Wilson came to
her death at 5 Capp street on Novem
ber 1 from hypertophied dllltation of
the heart with fatty degeneration, en
larged kidneys and liver, contusions of
the body, hyperemia of the brain; said
contusions being the result of kicks
and beating of the said Annie "Wilson
by a person known to the Jury as
Charles George Smith, and we, the
Jury, charge the said Charles George
Smith with the crime of murder."
Before thi3 verdict had been ren
dered the case against Smith had been
stricken from the calendar in Judge
Fritz's Police Court. Later In the day
he was booked for murder.
NATIONAL SUPERVISION.
* At present there are three divisions or de
partments of the Government collecting- data
aÂ« to the mineral products, viz., the United
Ftates Geological Survey, the United States
Census and the United States mint.' This
work could ba better done by one .division or
department. If we cannot succeed In 1 obtain
ing the consent of Congress to Â¦ give us a
Cabinet officer, let us then take the next
best thing and ask for a Department of Mines
and Mining. In which shall be concentrated
these. different division* or departments now
â¢enfraged in similar work. â¢
That ls to say. if we see we cannot get
Congress to give us a Cabinet officer, then urge
upon it the necessity of creating a mining de
partment with a commissioner such as ls at
present the United States Commissioner of the
General Land Office > under the Secretary of
the Interior, who shall be United States-Com
missioner -of .MuUcf _ under -the - same secre
tary,' or under the Department . of - Commer.ce
and Industry. Then we shall 1 have the offi
cials Â«f - the -United 'States Mint, the United
States Census and the United. States Geological
Survey working together to a common end.,In
stead of each working Independently to the
confusion of- the others.
Let these separate divisions be regulated
Much general Information that con
cerns the mining Interest of the entire
country was gathered by the, commit
tee on mines and mining relative to the
relations of the' Government to the
miners. Some unpublished extracts
from the report of that committee,
which was submitted by W. C. Rals
ton, are also given, as follows:
This would give Immediate protection against
injury from all sources and would afford equal
rights to mine by the 'hydraulic process under
the law throughout the mining belt.- We
ir^&V ec< l min , en . <1 that *" appropriation of
Â£500,000 be asked for from the national Gov
ernment and.a like amount from the -State,
to be expended as above outlined, and that this
association take Immediate steps, to secure
action In the premises through our Senators
and Representatives In Congress and" the mem
bers of the Legislature -of this State.
Then let the amount secured from the State
be used for tha construction of the . smaller
storage dam*, forming part of the plan* pro
posed in tha aforesaid reports, and also for
the purpose of building any section of the
work on the larger systems. > â¢
To avoid possible delays, such as followed
the first appropriation by Congress for the
Yuba system. It might be advisable to secure
the Federal appropriation free from the con
dition that the State would appropriate a like
amount.
RECOMMEND PROCEDURE.
Instead then of urging one system at a desig.
rated place on any of the said rivers or on
any of their tributaries, let us endeavor to
secure action on all the proposed sites In sec
tions; otherwise the present generation may
not live to eee thÂ» plans suggested by the
Mendell and Biggs commission reports become
accomplished facts. Â»*Â«"Â«=
These reports emphasize the nc-cessity for
action to the end that the constantly moving
mass of debris, not the result of illegal min
ing, but of mining, natural erosion and other
causes of years dating back to the early his
tory of the Ptate when regulation was not
considered, might be held In check and pre
vented from Injuring the navigable waters
These reports are comprehensive and set
forth rcommendatlons for storage of debris

engineers have officially proclaimed a neces
sity. Experience on the Yuba River eystem
shows that construction must proceed In sec

The Bear, American. Cosumnes. Mokelumne,
Calaveras. Stanislaus and Tuolumne rivers, to
gether with the respective tributaries of each,
have received the seme attention as that given
to the Yuba and Its tributaries in preliminary
work aiming to accomplish the purposes to be
served by the Yuba. system of debris restraln
ment. Besides the act of 1603 has specially
adopted the plans suggested by the Mendell
0 ' 1SS2< and of the B1 &*s commission
of 1891 for all these streams, and made them
the basis of future operations whenever ap
propriations are made therefor.
The time has come for this association to
take up a new line of work and urge operation
not only In one place, but throughout the hy
draulic mining sections. In doing this It will
follow the recommendations submitted to the
War Department under the sanction of the
laws of Conerefia.
NEW LINE OF WORK.
No better or more effective labor can be
performed by this association than that of
meeting any opponent la unwarranted war
fare not only airalnst the mining communities
but against the Interests of the valleys as well.
This association should not. and we are as
eured will not. defend any violators of the
law, nor should it sustain any person who
does not in good faith abide by the terms of
any permit to mine by the hydraulic process
Issued under existing law. liut it should be
distinctly understood and proclaimed that it
will back up any legally obtained permit iÂ«o
long as it remains unrevoked and the holder
thereof honestly complies with its terms.
MAKE PREDICTION.
There Is every reason to predict that with
the completion of the Yuba system, designated
by- the commission as "the project of 1899,"
end like systems on the other streams affect
ing the hydraulic mining field, the percentage
of tbe>Â»e failures, email even now, will grow
less by reason of tha greater protection af
forded by the eettling baslne forming part
of the proposed works.
Another unfulfilled prediction made was that
the miners would not in good faith observe
the law. This commission now reiterates the
statement contained in some of its official re
ports that but few cases of Illegal mining
have beÂ«i reported. The^e ceased upon
proper notice being given, the parties con
cerned in most cases applying for and obtaining
the necessary licenses.
Threatened litigation, constantly held before
tha public, is accountable for the small num
ber of applications for permits reported by
(-ail commission. It produces timidity on
the part of intending investors and retards
the prosperity of many w-etlons of our State.
That tht-re Is no Just ground for the same is
amply proven by the results already attained,
notwithstanding that settling reservoirs re
main unfinished.
Much of Interest to miners in Califor
nia was contained In reports that were
submitted by committees of the mining
convention of the last week, of which
the limits of space necessarily prevent
ed publication in full. Debris dams led
the way in Importance as a subject of
discussion and action. A long report
was made by A. Camlnettl for the com
mittee on debris dams. Some extracts
are herewith supplied that have not
been published.
The report opened with the state
ment that the committee, following its
custom to visit the California Debris
Commission, had received from the
commission statements regarding the
work performed under the act of 1S93.
Then It was predicted that the process
of restraining debris on the Yuba River
will be in operation to a considerable
extent during the present season. The
proposed cut at Daguerre Point will
not be completed in much less time
than two years. The committee re
ported as follows:
The prediction that regulation of hydraulic
mining would not be made effective Is fully
disproved by tha authority of experienced and
able engineer*. It is cause for congratula
tion that the commlFElon now, end for some
year* part, haÂ« placed itself on record on this
subject In saying that "no considerable fall
,ure" of Impounding barriers- built or main
tained under its license has come to Us notice;
that while oecaslonaly a break occurs, the to- |
Â«I number of failures has been "comparatively
email" and that "no large percentage of tha
debris Impounded has escaped by reason of
such failures."

Lester Good and his cousin, E. L.
Good, did not appear to be well named,
according to Judge Cabaniss. He sent
them to jail for five months on the
charge of carrying^ concealed weapons.
The defendants were originally arrest
ed in connection with the hold-up of a
car on Hayes street one week ago. The
policemen who took them Into custody
found them with revolvers in their
right-hand coat pockets and their
hands tightly gripping the weapons.
Cartridges were also found In their
pockets. The police failed In the at
tempt to convict them of the car hold
up, but showed 'that the two men were
hiding in the shadow of an unfrequent
ed street. They could give no explana
tion for their presence with loaded re
volvers, and both of them were given
the limit on the charge against them.
Charles Taylor, the colored man who
insisted In taking his "Dixie Queen" to
supper under the pressure of a razor,
was sentenced to 100 days in Jail by
Judge Conlan yesterday. The defend
ant pleaded hard for more considera
tion, but the Judge thought he was too
Impulsive a character In his love mak
ing, and should be given time to re
cover his faculties.
Manuel . Moreno is a sailor from
Mazatlan. He shipped on a bark and
was landed in" San Francisco. On the
streets of the city he met Henry Val
lejos, a traveler from the deserts of
Sonora. The co'mmunlty of a common
language made them friends. Moreno
was without "shelter and Vallejos took
him to his "casa" at 1313 Dupont street,
where he fed his new acquaintance
liberally on the slender stores of a
Mexican household and brought forth
the blankets of his grandfather for him
to sleep on. When the family awoke
they discovered that nearly all of the
valuables of the house were missing,
which Intrinsically were not great. A
warrant was sworn out and Moreno
was found wasting the proceeds In
wine-Â»bibblng and roistering by night.
When he appeared before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday he was sentenced
to three months in the County JaiU
"As an evidence of good faith," said
the Judge, "you may take another six
months in the County Jail. Thank you
warmjy for your gratitude."
Garibaldi Is one of the types of the
crooked days in the political life of San
Francisco, ar.d he rose to eminence be
cause he controlled a large number of
votes in the Italian quarter. His
prominence was too large for the
capacity of the man and for fifteen
years he has spent the greater part of
his time In the custody of the police.
Garibaldi wanted to see the Judge
personally, and he got his wish yes
terday. "I believe you wanted to see
me, Flynn, the other night,", said the
Judge suavely. "What was the matter
which you wanted to adjudicate in that
press of people?" , ~
"I wanted to thank you for that last
six months' sentence you gave me,"
answered Garibaldi.
Garibaldi Plynn, historic character of
the city, was given six months In the
County Jail by Judge Conlan yesterday.
One night during the present week
Garlb v aldi was doing his regular trip on
Kearay street, Insisting that passers
by 6hould contribute to his exchequer
Judga Conlan drifted along, warmly
wrapped in his rain coat, and Garibaldi
hailed him. The eminent jurist was
compelled to climb a car to avoid
violence.
Mrs. Laura Trevor was made a free
woman by a Jury of twelve good men
and true yesterday. She was accused
of stealing $3 from the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company, and con
ducted her own defense before Judge
Mogan. The trial lasted all Thursday
and yesterday, and was one of the sen
sational features of the Police Court.
The Jury remained out nearly an hour
and finally brought In a verdict acquit
ting the woman. Until the adjournment
of court she was compelled to sit in the
prisoners' dock to adjust several fines
which had been Imposed on her for
contempt during the course of the trial.
She was finally allowed to go on her
own recognizance, and will probably be
dismissed when she appears for fur
ther sentence. Judge Mogan relaxed
into his usual good nature when the
trial was ended, and Is figuring on a
vacation to restore his shattered nerv
ous system.
â¢ â¢ ' â¢
Judge Cabaniss concluded yesterday
that a water spaniel dog should be ex
ecuted. It is not often that he passes
on cases of capital punishment, and he
shudders at the Idea. The defendant
on trial was A. Govaniti, who main
tains a butcher shop at Market street
and Rose avenue. For the last three
rrionths he has maintained a well-man
nered dog in addition to his business.
He testified he had always found the
dog kind and affectionate, not only to
himself, but to the customers at his
shop. The complaining witness. James
O'Toole, told the court that his little
boy had been bitten by the dog,- and
the Judge assured him that the dog
should be killed.
Robert W. Mitchell, general agent of
the New York Life Insurance Company,
who made a complaint against David
Baird, the degenerate inheritor'of his
father's millions, because the latter in
sisted that Mitchell should drink with
him at the point of a revolver, ap
peared before Judge Fritz yesterday to
explain why he had not prosecuted the
complaint. He told the Judge he had
been 111 for several days, but failed to
give a satisfactory explanation for his
avoidance of the process of court for
several weeks. He received a lecture
and promised to appear at the next
calling of the case.
Fred Rlley and Thomas K. Batson
tired of the rain and the food In an
Oregon lumber camp and decided to
come to San Francisco. They were' ut
terly without the stipend^ that the rail
road people exact for journeys of this
kind, so. they climbed into an empty
box car, bound south. Their intent to
change locations was commendable,
but their method of locomotion in
volved them in trouble. A man with
a strip of tin sealed the" sliding doors
of the car, and they were prisoners
for two days without a chance to get
food or water. Even cattle suffer and
lose weight under such conditions.
When the railroad officials found the
cargo without vouchers they had them
arrested on the â¢ charge of vagrancy.
The itinerants Bhowed the result of
their experiences when they appeared
before Judge Fritz yesterday. Neither
had any money, and in compassion
they were held over for one day bo
that prison fare might fill out the
wrinkles In their loose-fitting clothes.
As soon as a tendency for normal obes
ity develops In them they will be given
their freedom, with the congratula
tions of the court.

FARM75RS ARE REJOICING.
Heavy Rainfall Is 'Recorded in the
Interior of the State.
SONOMA, Nov. 20.â The rains this
month came at a most opportune time
for the farmers and dairymen, the pre
cipitation for the month up to the pres
ent time being 4.72 Inches. The rain
fall for the Beason to date is 5.06 inches
against 9.44 for the corresponding pe
riod last year. In so far as old So
noma Is concerned the farmers and
dairymen have fared better by this
lack of early rainfall than otherwise.
Last season the rains were not only
early, but excessive, and the dairymen
suffered a loss of dry feed which they
escaped this season. The farmer, too,
was benefited by the rainy season
holding oft until November, as It ena
bled him to harvest his late grape and
j)ther crops and prepare for the win
der season. Taking It all in all no sea
son has ever started in more auspi
ciously for" the Sonoma Valley farmer

The storm was particularly severe In
the northern counties. Part of the rain
bearing clouds have gone east, but the
greater portion of the storm remains.
The wet weather will be of Immense
advantage to the agricultural section
of the State, McAdie says. Last night
the storm was clearing at the southern
end and we may see a clearing of the
skies this afternoon. The course of the
storm Is as yet uncertain, however, and
those who hone for pleasant weather
may be disappointed.
The rainfall In San Francisco for the
twenty-four hours preceding 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon amounted to 2.3S
Inches. The November rainfall thus
far amounts to 4.07 inches. The aver
age November rainfall for fifty-five
years Is 2.75 Inches. Professor McAdie
of the Weather Bureau adds that there
is still more rain coming., Showers
were both frequent and heavy in the
northern half of California yesterday.
HEAVY RAINFALL.
The old mission at Eighteenth and
Dolores streets was flooded yesterday
and some damage was done. Every ef
fort was made to prevent serious dam
age and the work of the laborers
showed good results.
The Presidio presented a doleful ap
pearance yesterday. The rain came
down in torrents and it was all mud
and mire underfoot. The old quarters
leaked and the inmates, suffered great
inconvenience. The soldiers who are
living in tents also suffered. The rains
beat In through the entrance flaps and
also leaked in through the canvas. The
men huddled around their stoves to be
comfortable and in many instances had
to seek dryer quarters.
Lights were out In the vicinity of the
Seventeenth-street station Thursday
night. The station is located in the
lower portion of the city and the flood
water of the Mission district flowed
toward the police rendezvous. Officers
had difficulty in getting in and out of
the station. Water surrounded the
place and it measured three feet in
depth.
PRESIDIO SUFFERS.
ered the tracks and the passengers
imagined they were on a ferry-boat.
Traffic on the street car lines was
exceedingly heavy throughout the day.
Defays were frequent, however, as the
motor and grip men had difficulty in
bringing their cars through the flood of
water alone their routes.
Horses stabled In the stock yards at
Tenth and Harrison streets had a nar

The horses became frightened and the

and were glad to arrive without being
ditched. In some places the water cov-
Water backed up at Sixteenth and
Folsom streets yesterday and flooded
the Glass Works located there. The
water mixed with the oil and caused
considerable damage. The damage is
estimated at J1000. A little chophouse
at Sixteenth and Folsom streets was
also flooded and the proprietor and his
help worked energetically to clear the
place of mud and water.
Sidewalks, fences and everything
movable is floating around at Bryant
and Eighth streets. The flood has done
considerable damage in the vicinity.
The small boy devoted his leisure to
paddling over the lake. ' The water has
reached a depth of four feet..
Breaks in sewers were also reported at
Bush and Stockton streets, which flood
ed the sidewalks; at Bryant and Main
streets, which were impassable; at San
some and Sutter streets, at Front and
Halleck streets and In other localities.
In all fifty breaks were reported to
the street bureau, which took Imme
diate measures to prevent further dam
age. A large number of overflowing
cesspools at various corners were also
reported to the street bureau.
The raina caused a cave-in along the
Southern Pacific Railroad tracks on
Harrison street, between Twentieth
and Twenty-first streets. The San Jose
train arriving at 8 o'clock went over
the break safely, but the next train,
which was due at 8:30, was stopped by
George W. Brown, as stated, and a
wreck averted. The passengers were
compelled to alight and take the street
cars to arrive at their destination. All
subsequent trains were stopped^at the
Valencia street station until the cave-
In was repaired.
RESIDENCES FLOODED.
The basement of the warehouse occu
pied by the Friedman Furniture Com
pany at Eighth and Brannan streets
was flooded with six feet of water, and
as a result many thousands of dollars'
worth of furniture was floated about on
the water, causing a great deal of
damage.
A serious overflow in the sewer at the
corner of Fourteenth and Harrison
streets, as a result of the heavy rains,
was brought to the attention of the
Board of Public Works yesterday morn
ing, and Superintendent of Sewers
Brandon with a force of twenty men
was dispatched to the scene at once.
Brandon learned that the overflow was
caused by the high tide forcing its way
up the Channel street sewer, which
prevented the escape of the storm
waters through the main outlet.
The water rose to a height of four
feet In the immediate vicinity of the
overflow and was fast entering the low
er floors of the surrounding dwellings.
Brandon realized that nothing could be
done to stop the overflow, and he di
rected his men to remove the furniture
In the lower floors to the second stories
of the surrounding houses before much
damage was done.
MANY SEWERS BREAK.
But fcr the thoughtfulness and cour
age of George W. Brown, who lives at
2429A Harrison street, the Southern
Pacific Company might have lost
thousands of dollars, and passengers
bound for the city their lives. Brown
was on his way to work when he saw
opposite his house a great excavation.
He saw the danger to the incoming
trains as the water had washed the
road bed out from beneath the track.
More than twenty feet of track was
resting on the wooden ties, which were
suspended over the hole. Brown had
no time to send word to the Railroad
Company. He heard the engine whistle
in the distance and knew that the train
was due. He rushed tip the track to
ward the oncoming train, waving his
hat and ' doing everything to attract
the engineer's attention. He was suc
cessful in his efforts, as Engineer 1|LE.
Montgomery succeeded in bringin^his
machine to a standstill within two feet
of the gaping hole. The passengers
filed out into the rain, and when they
discovered that Brown had saved their
lives they wanted to make up a
purse and give it to him, but he de
clined the offer. Instead of waiting for
the praise due him. Brown went to his
work. Half an hour later a wrecking
crew was on the scene repairing the
break.
Heavy rains during the last forty
eight hours flooded the city and did
great damage. Sewera were broken,
and debris flowed into cellars and
lower apartments. The Mission Dis
trict suffered most by the storm.
Streets were flooded and pedestrians
and vehicles had difficulty In gaining
passageway. It was the first heavy
storm of the season and the men em
ployed by the Board of Public Works
had their hands full. Reports came
from every section of the city about
the inadequacy of the sewers to carry
away the superfluous water.
The Fourth-street bridge had a nar
row escape from destruction early yes
terday morning. The water In the chan
nel had risen to the planking and there
was every fenr that the bridge would
give way. Passengers on incoming
trains had difficulty in reaching the
street cars. The Townsend street
depot was surrounded by water and
people had to wade through the water
to reach the cars. Prompt steps were
taken by the Railroad Company to get
rid of the small lake, and by noon pas
sageway had been secured.

"I hid his gun. He threatened to
shoot me earlier in the day. I had on a

After I struck him I stayed there. This
ain't the first time we have had trouble.
"Mrs. Distrell burned the stick in the

stayed down. He struck me first and
then I ran into the kitchen and got a

I make this statement voluntarily with

It Is the theory of the prosecution
that Drayuer was killed on Thursday
evening. August 6, by a blow on the
forehead, which caused a fracture of
the skull at the base of the brain, and
that Mrs. Drayuer remained in the
house with the corpse until Sunday be

of her husband. Mrs. Drayuer con
tends that the blood on her garments
was obtained at a time when she as
sisted her husband to a lounge after
she had struck him down with the
stovewood.
"I hereby confess that Mr. 'Drayuer
and myself had trouble Thursday even
ing. August 6, and he struck me in the
face. I had taken more wine than I
ought to. In the front room the trouble
occurred. He was very hasty. I hit
him with a stick and burned the stick.
He struck me first. I hit him with a
piece of stovewood. I did not know
where I struck him I was so mad. He
fell down after I hit him. He seemed
crazy and fell to the floor.
SANTA ROSA. Nov. 20.â At the trial
of Mrs. Sophie Drayuer. charged with
the murder of her husband, the prose
cution to-day continued to weave the
web around the accused. The story of
the scene In the death chamber was
told to the Jury by Deputy Sheriff Ben
H. Barnes of Healdsburg. John Winder
and other witnesses. The blood-stained
garments worn by Mrs. Drayuer on the
day she had the trouble with her hus
band were introduced in evidence and
admitted by Judge Lawler. A state
ment made by Mrs. Drayuer to Sheriff
Frank P. Grace. Deputy Sheriff Barnes
and City Marshal Parker of Healds
burg. reduced to writing and signed by
the accused, was identified and intro
duced in evidence against objections
by the defendant's counsel. This state
ment is as follows:

NEW YORK. Nov. 20.â Bradstreefs
to-morrow win say:
Colder weather over the greater part
of the country has gTeatly stimulated
retail trade and incidentally quickened
the jabbing demand in seasonable lines.
In soir.e sections inquiries for holiday
poods exceed last year, the feature be
ir.g the high grade of materials taken.
Interior retailers, helped by propitious
agricultural conditions, are reported
meeting obligations more promptly.
Farming interests are apparently in
good financial condition, an inference
that seems to be evidenced by the fact
that they display unwillingness to part
with their surplus products at anything
!<\<=s than what they deem satisfactory
prices, though the movement of cur
rency to the Interior continues, but on
a smaller scale than for some weeks.
Southern conditions are especially good.
While the foregoing are the favorable
developments of the week, the fact
must not be overlooked that labor trou
bles, the gleomy situation for building,
the closing down of iron and steel mills,
blast furnaces and leather tanneries,
nr.d the continued hesitancy in the buy
ing nf practically all commodities, are
factors that mar the industrial as well
as the commercial fabric.
It is a buyers* market in iron and
steel and kindred products, with the 1
general tendency toward a lower price ;

NEW YORK. Nov. 20.â R. G. Dun &
Co.'s Weekly Review of Trade to-mor
row will say:
Labor organizations are accepting re
ductions in wages witho-ut controversy,
which removes one threatened indus
trial factor, and in several branches of
business orders are more numerous, but
in the steel industry there is little ex
pectation of liberal buying until 1904.
Construction work is decreasing, despite
optimistic reports of more building per
mits issued last month than a year j
ago. Mild weather etlll checks distri- j
bution of merchandise, usually in brisk
demand at this season, which check is
reflected in restricted activity at woolen
and worsted mills and clothing facto
ries.

SANTA ROSA, Nov. 20.â More than
six inches of rain has fallen in Santa
Rosa and vicinity since Wednesday
morning. The precipitation from
Thursday morning at 7 o'clock to 7
o'clock , this morning was 2.34 inches.
Between this morning and 1 this after
noon 1.55 inches fell and a similar
amount fell during the afternoon. The
Russian River is out of its banks at
several places and it is probable that
some damage has been done. Santa
Rosa Creek rose rapidly all day and to
night great quantities of water are go
ing toward the sea. Culverts and sew
ers in this city have been insufficient
to handle the falling water and it has
backed up and flooded tne streets.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 2o.â A heavy
rain fell last night and to-day through- j
out the Sacramento Valley and in the
mountains and foothills. In many
places in the upper part of the valley
the precipitation amounted to more
than two inches during the twenty-four
hours ending at 7 o'clock this morning.
The heaviest fall was at Dunsmuir,
where 2.71 -was recorded. The fall was
heavy on the west side of the Sacra
mento River. Fourteen inches of snow
fell at the summit of the Sierra Ne
vada Mountains. The rain is pleasing
to farmers and stockmen. It will en
able the former to plow and feed will
commence to spring up rapidly for
stock.
Yeatman had evidently prepared the
trap, which consisted of hew^d timbers,
and had been in the act of testing it
when it sprung and caught him. Un
able to raise the weight fram his legs
the man met a slow and cruel death
from cold and hunger. Th? ax with
which he had made the deadfall was
lying buried under the snow just out
of reach of his hands.
A search of eight days for the missing
man was ended tofday by the receipt
of a report from Indians that his body,
bruised and emaciated, had been found.
Early on the morning of November 10
Yeatman, with his sixteen-year-old
son, left their home on Valdez Island
for the mainland to hunt. They sep
arated early in the day In a mountain
valley, the father promising his son
that as soon as he had visited a num
ber of bear traps and deadfalls he had
further m> the mountain side he would
return to the shore inhere their boat
was moored. The lad returned at night
fall, but his father did not arrive. That
night ten inches of snow felJ and a
blizzard prevailed. The boy was found
next day by another party of hunters.
He was half dead from cold and ex
posure and it took the men a day to
get him home. Then they starred to
search for the father. Fresh snow ob
literated all tracks and hampered their
movements. This afternoon, however.
Indians arrived with the news that the
body of the man was found in a dead
fall.

The University of Arizona Is a stand
ing evidence that Arizona means, very
soon to become a State oh- the level of
the best, for no self-respecting State in
these, days would dare to start out'
without at least one, State institution
of college grade. It might almost be said
that the practical wisdom of the State
makers is measured by the degree of
concentration of these efforts. At any
rate Arizona has followed the excellent
'example of California, and Minnesota
in placing all its interests under one
management, and so the University of
Arizona, at Tucson, comprehends the
college 'of agriculture and mechanic

Rumors are rife that there is likely to be another lynch

It must be consoling to neighboring communities that
county lines are respected in these little affairs.
A certain liquor dealer In this city
whose name shall be nameless for the
present has decided that it was not
wise to try and cheat Uncle Sam out
of his Just dues in the matter of whis
ky tax. This is how it all. happened.
Our good friend is a German and has
all the native German warmth of soul;
therefore, when two young men with
frank, open countenances came to him
one day and mysteriously stated that
they had a good 'proposition which they
would like to let him in on he led tha
way to the private office immediately"
There the two, honest young men pro
duced a flask and asked the genial li
quor merchant to sample it. "We've
got Just one barrel of that stuff which
has come straight from the Cumber
land Mountains in Kentucky and a
Government official never saw the bar
rel, either," said they, with a knowing
wink. . b
It looked good to our German friend
and he paid for the forty-gallon bar-^
rel at $2 a gallon right on the spot
The goods were delivered in ship-shape
order the next day and the liquor man
chuckled at. the thought of beating the
Government out of 51 25 per gallon
Forthwith he went. below and tapped
the new keg for a gallon; yes, it tasted
Just like; the sampleâ there was no skin
came there. Then for a no ther gallon.

Jn these days of much traveling it 13
nothing unusual to run acro33 persons
who have crossed the Atlantic forty,
fifty or even a hundred times. But the
record of the most assiduous of these
voyagers pales to Insignificance beside
that of Thomas Klnsey. who is a purser
of the American Steamship Line of
New York. Mr. Klnsoy has Just com
pleted his eight hundred and twenty
seventh Atlantic passag?. which i3 un
doubetdly more by a hundred or so than
any other man alive can show. As Mr.
Kinsey Is by no means a man of ad
vanced age, and as he is regularly
making two tripa every month, it la
likely that he will accomplish a total
of a thousand or more crossings before
he retires from the sea. The veteran
traveler first crossed the ocean as a lad
of 10 years in the City of Manchester,
one of the earliest of screw steamships.
Since that time he has seen steamships
multiplied In size tenfold and the time
of the ocean Journey cut down from
twelve days to six. He has made the

MR. BELL, new Democratic Representative from the
Second District of California) has made a speech in
the House against Cuban reciprocity. In this he
declared that the farmers of California need the measure of
protection now afforded them by the Dingley bill, and that
the sugar-beet growers demand this. He warned the Re
publicans that California is not surely in the Republican
column because of the feeling of the people on this question.
Sugar beets, however, are not the only product of Califor
nia that has and needs protection. Mr. Bell will doubtless
come home and run again next year, as a Democrat. The
planters of this State have protection, and need it, on. citrus
fruits, olive products, raisins and wool. In Mr. Bell's dis
trict the citrus planters of Butte, Yuba and 'Suiter,' and the
raisin planters of Yolo, and the olive planters all over his
territory, like the wine-grape growers, - want the protection
afforded by the Dingley bill. -
When Mr. Bell runs again will he stand by his declara
tions just made in the House? â¢ Wil< he agree to stay out
of his party caucus and refuse to commit himself to the de
struction of that protection which he now says is necessary?
In the event of his party getting Champ Clark's majority in
the next House, .will he pledge himself to oppose the election
of a Speaker who will organize the Committee of Ways and
Means Â£or the removal of that protection to California in
dustries which he now declares is necessary to their exist
ence? ' Â«-Jr^*'*i 'Â¦*Â¦Â¦" ., :
Mr. Bell may occupy some of his leisure in preparing his
answer to these inquiries. It is one thing to oppose a Re
publican administration measure of reciprocity, by. praising
the Republican policy of .protection, but it is quite another
thing to stand by protection on the stump as a Democratic
candidate for Congress. Mr. Bell isra statesman or he
would not be in Congress. The Republican members who
are with him in opposing' reciprocity will next year.'and the
next, stand by protection. Will he? Or will he turn his
party policy of free trade loose in the vineyards of Napa and
Sonoma,, the citrus orchards .of' the .Sacramento Valley, the
raisin plantations of Yolo, the sheep â¢ ranges of Lake and
Mendocino, the olive orchards oLButte, to uproot them all?

Count Tisza.
Count Stephen Tisza, who for the sec
ond time has undertaken the duties of
Austro-Hungarian Prime Minister, is
reputed one of the ablest public men in
Hungary,' and certainly the ablest of
the younger generation. He is sup
posed to represent a policy of "the
Btrong hand" and to be rather inclined
to crush than to outmaneuver a foe.
.Like many men of ctrong character, he
is not popular, and he has never con
tented to court public favor. He Is a
vigorous partisan of the dual system,
and is one of the few Hungarians cred
ited with possessing a comprehensive
knowledge of international relations
and of Hungary's true international
horizon and an accurate perception of
its position In relation to the rest of
Europe. He is not devoid of ambition,
! and his friends express anxiety lest his
career should be wrecked in a vain at
tempt to solve a situation which many
believe to be Insoluble under present
conditions. "Hungary," says a Vienna
correspondent of a London newspaper,
"is not overstocked with great men,
and a second fiasco, 'which would stamp
him as the fruitless candidate of Vien
na, would damage his prestige to an
I extent from which' even his youth
might not enable him to recover. It is
therefore .'to be hoped that his attempt
may succeed and that the Impulse
which has made, him throw himself
into the breach may not prove to have
been as futile as it was generous."
PROFESSOR STEWART'S address before the Coun
cil of Jewish Women on "The Musical Needs of San
Francisco" is a valuable contribution to the discussion
of a subject which ought to be taken up seriously within the
near future. It is quite possible indeed that the address will
prove the beginning of a vigorous campaign of education on
the subject and lead to action. At any rate the plea appeals
to a sentiment already formed and the response to it from
the public will be as prompt as was the applause from the
audience.
As a rule American communities have given little atten
tion to genuine musical culture. In fact so slight was" the
study. given to the art in times past that for many years Bos
ton managed to maintain a high reputation as a musical cen
ter merely by erecting a big organ and supporting an ora
torio society. The influence of the French, German and
Italian elements that have been infused into the population of
our larger cities of recent years has had the effect of enor
mously stimulating the study of music and elevating the
popular taste in regard to it, but still in most American com
munities very little has been done to provide adequate means
for either musical instruction or musical performances.
So far as popular taste and public appreciation of good
music go San Francisco ranks as high as any other city in
the Union and probably higher than any other, yet even here
the provisions for musical culture and for musical perform
ances are far below the level. of what they should be. The
suggestion that the two universities establish and maintain
chairs of music is a good one and has doubtless long ere this
engaged the attention of the presidents of those institutions.
Even were it carried out, however, as of course it will be
eventually, the musical needs of San Francisco will be unsat
isfied. We may confidently expect all our needs of this kind
to be supplied .in the future, but an incessant discussion of
them by persons of recognized authority will have a good
effect in hastening the coming of that time.

How Comes the End?
Speculations concerning the manner
in which life on the world â¢will come to
an end are as varied as they are Inter
esting. Here are some of the latest
theories, according to a writer in Har
per's Weekly: As the interior of tho
earth grows gradually cooler, the wa
ters on the surface will sink and be
absorbed until the exterior of the globe
is a parched and uninhabitable desert.
Another theory is that the water will
encroach on the land, eating it away
until the oceans entirely cover the sur
face. A more picturesque theory holds
that our world Is bound eventually to
collide with one cf the Innumerable
comets that are tearing lrrespor.siM/

suddenly become so intensified that tka
earth will be shriveled up like a moth

Rubbers.
The spectacle presented by a certain
treasurer of a theater here in town as
he lay back in his high chair in the of

laughed uproariously, almost caused a
stampede In the long line of people who
were waiting an opportunity to pur
chase seats at the window. He laughed
until tears ran down his cheeks and the
attaches of the theater were beginning
to think that his brain was softening.
He evidently could not control him
self and he flnallr called, an assistant,
surrendered his chair .to him and
walked out.
Then he explained. "When I came
on duty this morning at 9 o'clock," said
he, "the line of people waiting for
tickets extended a full block.- The / most
noticeable figure in the line was a great
big fat German. He was standing away
down the line when I first saw him.
Well, I used him for a sort of gauge,
and I figured that it would be about 11
o'clock by the time he got to the ticket
window. It was just 11:15 when he
showed ud and I, figuring that a man
of his proportions and very evident
unwieldlness, who could stick to such
a tantalizing job as waiting for a
chance to buy a couple of seats de
served something pretty good, pre
pared to hand him out the best in the

Mountain Destruction.
BY GEOHGE FREDERICK K. WRIGHT,
A. M.. LU D.
{Author of "Ths Icp A^f in North America."
â¢'Man onii the Glacial Period." etc.)
The comparatively recent age of the
highest mountains is most conclusively
ehown from the simple fact that they
have resisted the vigorous .denuding
agencies which are everywhere at work
to tear them down; that is, the fact
that they exist at all shows that they
are young. For the moment a wrinkle
of land rises out of the water
the winds and rains and frost
begin to act upon it, tearing
it to pieces and carrying it back into
the sea. The higher it rises the more
active become all these agencies. The
Hanks of the slowly rising mass are
soon plowed into gorges and ravines
by the torrents of water which flow
rapidly down them, while the rocks
above are cracked by the alternate ac
tion of the heat of the sun's rays and
the cold of the rarified atmosphere at
great heights, so that a vast talus of
rocky debris collects about all the prec
ipices, while glaciers in slow but ma
jestic movements pick up the debris
and carry it down to lower levels, at
the same time grinding a considerable
portion of it into powder, bo that it can
be easily carried off by the floods re
fulting from the melting of the ice.
Calculations as to the rapidity with
which these denuding agencies are at
work in all high mountains would
show some startling results. At the
4 ate at which these agencies are at
work in the Alps they will lose from
10,000 to 12.000 feet of their height in
the course of 1.000.000 years, and there
fore be reduced to somewhat such pro
portions as we have in the Allegheny
Mountains or in the mountains of New
England. But the greater masses of
mountains of Central Asia and in
Western America would resist these
agencies for a much longer period, and
will remain in lofty heights long after
puch narrow ranges as the .Alps and
the Caucasus have dwindled into in
significance. The principal evidence
upon which Professor Russell relies to
prove the very recent elevation of
Mount St. EMas is that its flanks show
bo little sign of erosion. The streams of
water and ice coming down from It
rave scarcely begun to eat into its
side*, as they have done upon most
other mountains of that height.
The picturesque features of mountain
scenery are mostly due to the erosion of
mountain torrents, and are consequent
ly a feature of their youth. In their old
age mountains become subdued in ap
pearance and generally lose much of
their ruggedness, consisting merely of
bosses of harder rock moderate in
height which have resisted erosion
more puccessfully than other portions,
and which are now perhaps more than
half buriod in the debris that accumu
lated about their bases. The Piedmont
region of our Southern Atlantic States
and large portions of New England
are striking illustrations of this effect-
In Europe the Ural Mountains are an
other illustration, which now consist of
a moderate elevation of old rocks ris
ing but 1000 or 2000 feet above the gen
tly sloping plains of sedimentary rock
which stretch long distances both into
Europe and into Asia.
While the majority of the mountains
of the world have been formed by the
slow elevation of vast continental areas
and the subsequent erosion of their
sides ar.d softer portions, there is an
other class of great interest directly
connected with volcanic forces. Vesu
vius and Mount Etna are familiar ex
emple* in the old world of mountain
heights which have been formed by
the Fuceessive and long-continued
eruption of lava and volcanic ashes
piling up a cone about the opening (in
the case of Etna to a height of nearly
30,000 feet), while :n North America
we have extinct volcanic cones, formed
in a similar manner, in Mount Shasta
(U.440 feet in height). Mount Ranier
(14.444), Mount Popocatapetl (17,784),
and various -peaks in South America,
rising to a still greater height. Mount
Ararat and sevrral other peaks in that
vicinity are similar volcanic cones, ris
ing to a height of 17,000 foet. Fujiyama.
in Japan, is another, rising in beautiful
conelike proportions to an elevation of
12,000 feet from a region that is dotted
o\-er with many other volcanic cones of
emaller proportions. But most impres
sive of all to thj? scientific imagination
are tboEs towering volcanic cones like
Teneriffe and Maujia Loa, which, while
rising many thousand feet nbove the
level of the sea, have their bass at 'an
equal depth on the bottom of the ocean
below.
but the tap refused to leak a drop.
Yet the barrel was heavy and the
liquid inside swashed with an inviting
sound. Turn it this way and that,
there was nothing doing, and finally
the wise liquor merchant attacked the
barrel with an ax.
Ah. sad revelation! Within the bar
rel there was a gallon tube connected
directly with the spigot, which smelt
of the whisky which had flown. "The
other thirty -nine gallons were Spring
Valley water.
THE recent attempt to injure a young woman by en
ticing her into a vacant house in this city adds another
to the vacant house tragedies here. They are all of
the nature of the church tragedy in which two young women
lost their lives. We have now five such mysteries, though
fortunately in this last attempt the intended victim saved
herself and escaped.
It is no use to publish warnings to people, for they are for
gotten at the critical moment. If the young woman in this
last case had answered the thug's request that she enter the
house to help take care of his sister, who had fainted, by
telling him to call a policeman she would not have walked
into danger as she did. There is, however, one means of
preventing these peculiarly gruesome and revolting trage
dies'. It is the habit of owners of vacant houses that are for
rent to leave the key with a house agent or at a nearby store
of some sort and to advertise where it may be found on the
rent placard on the building. Any one goes to "the place
where the key is and secures it as an intending renter to in
spect the building. In possession of the key a criminal has
control of the premises for any purpose. He may duplicate
the key in order to get access to the house and rob it when
it is occupied or he may use it as a temporary shelter for
crime.
This custom of giving up keys to strangers should be stop
ped. It will cost the owner of the premises or the agent a
little trouble perhaps, but no more than is required by ordi
nary prudence in a freeholder. The present custom opens
the way to crime that may be committed without possibility
of detection. The custodian of a key seldom makes such
inspection of a proposed renter as to serve for identification
of a suspected thug, and a criminal wretch is as safe by such
methods in a large city as if he were in an unpeopled wil
derness.
The Police Department should admonish all house owners

ATTORNEY GENERAL WEBB has decided that the
law empowering horticultural officers to destroy trees
and vines which are infested with scale and other
noxious insects does not apply to trees and vines that have
diseases not traceable to the presence of insects. California
is much interested in the sanitation of orchards and vine
yards. Entomology has wrought mightily for this State in
discovering beneficial insects which prey upon their pre
daceous brethren. The importation of the ladybug, due to
the efforts of the late Frank McCoppin, saved our citrus
industry by eradicating the white scale, and it was followed
by the introduction of other insects which clean up the black
scale, and, we believe that even the San Jose scale is now un
der control.
But wherever nature plants exceeding capacity for any
form. of production there she plants also checks upon it. We
may complain that nature proceeded in defiance of economic
principles in providing insects and diseases to limit our fruit
product. But nature is unheeding of that criticism. Her
arrangements are anti-monopolistic r:id extend through all
forms of life. Existence has been defined as a struggle to
eat and avoid being eaten. It is the rule throughout all
forms of animate and inanimate life that where physicalcon
ditions favor any form and promote its maximum develop
ment there is the destroyer to hold it in check.
The decision. of the Attorney General that diseased trees
and vines may not be destroyed by any authority now con
ferred by law brings vegetable pathology to the front as a
science of the greatest importance to our fruit industry. It
is probable that there are not five completely equipped vege
table pathologists in the United States. The Agricultural
Department at Washington succeeded in securing one and
was permitted to pay him $1800 a year. The Government of
Japan heard of him and promptly secured him on a long con
tract at a salary of $8ooo a year. The Agricultural Depart
ment has found itself compelled to educate and train its own
experts in vegetable physiology and pathology and the
process is slow. Our schools are training such a surplus of
lawyers, doctors and pharmacists that they might well turn
their attention to giving us a few vegetable physiologists and
pathologists. California wants them, for here we have pecul
iar vegetable diseases.
When Eugene Sue described the use of a fungus to kill
men it was supposed to be a creation of the imagination. He
described the administration of ,a powdered fungus in the
drink. The victim felt no immediate ill effects, but finally
the fungus grew and sent its filaments into all the nutritive
and vital organs and killed men just as the parasitic fungus
is now known to kill vines and trees. In our vineyards we
have the Anaheim disease that has baffled allefforts to cure,
and also the California disease, both believed to be peculiar
to this State. It is not known that they are contagious, for
it seems probable that they arise in conditions that are not
communicable by contact. They have a destructive com
panion in the asparagus disease, which threatens that im
portant crop. Now it is probable that these diseases are
caused by a fungus, which enters the sap of the plant and
germinates there, just as Eugene Sue's fungus entered the
blood of men and sprouted and grew.
If these pests be non-contagious destroying the plants will
not eradicate them. They are part of nature's anti-monopoly
compaign to prevent too great abundance of any one form
of vegetable life. Where must their cause be sought? Is it
in the soil, the sunshine, the air? Only patient pathological
investigation can find the secret of their origin, and where
are the pathologists?
It must not be understood that we say that California is
alone in having these obscure vegetable diseases. The field
crops of the East and the trees and vines there have these
troubles. The great enemy of the Eastern peach is the "yel
lows," which has never appeared here, fortunately for our
peach growers, for it is the despair of the vegetable doctors.
It is probably of fungous origin. The wheat and corn crops
are attacked and injured by rust and smut, both fungi and
allied to the mushroom, which we eat with satisfaction, and
the toadstool, which we don't eat at all if we know it. When
we leave the orchard, garden, -vineyard and field and go into
the- forest we find the timber that guards our water supply
sick abed with these vegetable parasite diseases, and when
the whole field of nature is surveyed it is a vast hospital of
sick plants, calling for the services of the vegetable patholo
gist. Where is he?
Out of the Rain.
The first time I ran across her was
one stormy \night last winter. She
.begged 10 cents for a cup of coffee. I
hesitated. Beggars asking alms I met
nightly as I wended my way home af
ter my long hours* work. They were
mostly men, however, and as* I looked
at this poor, decrepit creature on
crutches, standing before me in the
rain, her slight body shaking with a
hacking, consumptive cough, I was
deeply touched. I fumbled In my pock
et for a quarter.
As she reached to get it a coin drop
ped from her hand. I immediately be
gan to upbraid her for being a profes
sional beggar. Tears filled her eyes as
she hurried to explain that she had a
little girl sick with a fever at home
and was endeavoring to get money
enough to 'get her some medicine.
"God knows I wouldn't ask you for
this if my child was not in need of
medical aid," she said. "I can't get
her a doctor. I can do no work my
self, bo I am compelled to beg. Oh,
you don't know how it hurts me."
I went with her to the place she
called home, more out of curiosity than
anything else, to see if she had been
telling the truth and really had a sick
child there. In a hovel way down on
the south -side lay the child. It took
but a glance from one not even versed
in medicine to tell that the child was
fast going beyond all medical aid. Poor
little thing, she stretched out her puny
arms and a flicker of a smile lit up
her wan face as her mother came into
the room.
I got a physician, but the little one
passed away during the night. "Ag
gravated case of scarlet fever," said
the doctor. The woman's grief was
pitiful. We took up a subscription
among the boys and we buried the
body. I could see In the mother's eyes
that longing for death, death which
alone brings relief from trouble. She
had nothing for which to drag out her
miserable life now. We gave her a
couple of, dollars and never met her
again on the street.
One night I bad occasion to go to the
Morgue for a story and a deputy cas
ually told me there was an unknown
woman down stairs. I went down
stairs to see the corpse. There lay the
crippled woman. I fancied I saw the
remains of a smile on the cold face.
She had found the death she sought
and had gone to the little one she
loved.
rious matters useful or injurious to the
bodyâ the former to be utilized, the
iattcr to be excreted. Thus we see
that the blood is" the great intermedi
ary, the great medium of the body.
From :t ell the organs obtain their
fcod; into it they cast their excreta.
Now, in the human body, as we have
said before, "things are seldom as they
seem." The body appears to be solid,
a homogeneous whole. In reality it i3
merely a vast mass of infinitely small
cells. The blood appears to be a simple
red fluid. In reality it is not red, nor
is it simple. The blood consists of two
portions, the plasma and a solid por
tion, the cells. The plasma, or liquor
Esr.guinis, is a transparent, colorless
fluid, in which are floating an immense
number of small bodies called
cells. These cells constitute near
ly one-half of â the total weight
of the blood. They are of several va
rieties, although, so far as known, the
work of the blood is performed by cells
of two kinds, the red blood cells, or
erythrocytes, and white cells, or leuko
cytes/. The red cells, as they are called,
are not really red, but when floating in
a thin layer of blood fluid, plasma, they
are seen to be of a pale straw color.
It is only when they are thicRly massed
together that they appear red.
Let us get clearly in mind a picture
of the blood stream propelled by Its
central pump and entirely filling Its
complex system of tubes. We can Im
agine the blood sweeping round and
round, making a complete circuit of
the double loop three times in each
minute. In the lungs it gives up its
load of poisonous matter and takes up
fresh oxygen with which to feed the
tissues. Then it goes back to the heart,
and the powerful contraction of the
left ventricle sends the blood in a great
gush, seventy-two to the minute,
through the complex maze of tubes
forming the circulatory system. In the
course of its journey through the body
the blood does many things. In the
stomach and intestines it absorbs di
gested food for its own replenishment-
While passing through another organ
this absorbed food, till then simply for
eign matter floating in the blood, be
comes actually a part of the blood. In
other organs red and white cells are
born. In others the dead cells are left
to be carried out of the body. Again,
certain products are consumed to keep
up the weight of the body, and certain
waste matters left behind in the rapid
sweep of the blood through the tissues.
Lastly, the blood, exhausted of its oxy
gen and heavily loaded with waste and
poisons, reaches the heart, from which
it is sent to the lungs to be purified,
and so commences another cycle. When
we remember that the blood stream
makes an entire circuit of the lungs
and the tissues in about twenty sec
onds and that it travels at the rate of
seven miles an hour, 160 miles a day,
we can realize something of the mar
velous work performed by it.
And all this work is done by the
blood cells, the -red cells (the erythro
cytes) and the white cells (the leuko
cytes). The red cells are the carriers
of the blood. These cells contain a
substance which has the power of ab
sorbing: oxygen, which is given out as
required 'during the circuit through the
tissues. These red blood cells are very
small â so small that it would require
3200 of them placed Bide by side to
reach one inch. Their number is enor
mous, there being no less than 70,000.
000.000 of them in a cubic inch of blood.
Their functions, however, are compara
tively simple. The great worker, the
most wonderful worker In the body
and the most Interesting cell known
to science, is the white cell of the blood,
the leukocyte. These remarkable crea
tures, often called phagocytes, "war
rior cells" or "devouring cells," are
possessed of such powers and are so
important as to deserve an article to
themselves, and we shall discuss them
in our next.

Of all the vital organs of the human

and the most important. "The blood ia
the life" embodies a truth that is not
merely metaphorical. It is actually
true. To some It may ceem strange to
refer to the blood as a vital organ. The
fact that it is fluid seems to make it
seem less important. Eut in reality the
blood is the center o* all life activities.

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMESThe Commissioners discussed at some
length the merits and demerits of the
several statues in Golden Gate Park.
It was the Judgment of the board that
the Starr King monument, designed by
Daniel Chester French, represented the
best work in that line In the park.
This monument is , seen by but few
visitors, as it Is in an out of the way
place and . very nearly concealed, by
foliage. President Spreckels and Su
perintendent McLaren were requested
to submit to the board an estimate of
the cost of placing the monument' in a
conspicuous position in the park.
The incident was reported that a
committee of the Grand Jury recently
visited Golden Gate Park and sampled
the pie at the children's quarters. The

The question of entering into the
half-yearly contracts for coal, lumber
and hay was discussed. The board de
cided to advertise for proposals for
supplying these commodities up to
March 1, 1904.
At the suggestion of Commissioner
Lloyd the secretary was instructed to
furnish an estimate of the quantity
and quality of tea, coffee, groceries,
milk, etc., for the children's quarters,
so that competition In furnishing such
supplies may be solicited.

A suggestion from Commissioner Sul
livan that the board reconsider Its ac
tion in accepting a fountain design re
cently submitted by M. Earl Cummings
caused an animated interchange of
views and the display of some warmth
on the part of Commissioner Altman,
the Artist member of the board, it ap
pears that Mr. Brandenstein of the
Board of Supervisors has been talking
to his Democratic brethren, Sullivan
and McDonald, telling them how
money for the maintenance of the
parks can be expended by the commis
sion and how it cannot be expended.
Brandenstein holds that all commodi
ties shall be open to competitive bid
ding. Commissioner Altman insisted
that the design of the fountain accept
ed bv the commission should not be
rejected. He did not believe in throw
ing cold water on a Californlan artist
who had Just returned from Europe.
Commissioner Altman made the point
clear to the understanding of Commis
sioners McDonald and Sullivan that
Cummings waa a Calif ornianâ as good
a Californlan as Sculptor Douglas Til

Superintendent McLaren said there
were several pheasants in Golden Gate
Park. President Spreckels remarked
that there was a large number of Mon
golian pheasants on his ranch twelve
miles south of San Jose and offered to
let the commissioners have for the park
all the birds that they could trap. Mr.
McLaren was authorized to engage a
trapper and get the birds. Mr. Rob

Speaking of the enterprise of Califor
nians in 1S51, he says that a restaurant
which was completely destroyed by fire
on Sunday was reopened for business
on the Wednesday following. Sir John
says he dined there on the occasion of
the reopening and the "menu was as
long as your arm." This eminent New
Zealander, who cave to Auckland a

George B. and George A. Dow, re
plying to Inquiries propounded by Com
missioners McDonald and Sullivan,, said
there was no private understanding
with any commissioner that the Dow
pump should be used. It was further
shown that Brown's employment at the
Dow works did not begin until a month
after work on the pumps for general
stock had been ordered. Brown, after
leaving the Dows, went to work for
Stillman. Pierce & Smith. Withdrawal
of the accusation of favoritism to Dow
being complete the subject was dis

The Park Commissioners met yester
day afternoon at the office of A. B*.

the members of the commission attend
ed the session. The commissioners ex
pected that J. H. Brown would be pres
ent to explain why he mada the asser
tion that work on the duplicate pump
for the Dutch windmill was in progress
at the Dow works before the contract
had been awarded. G. W. Ingalls, rep
resenting the firm of Stlllman, Pierce
& Smith, reported that Brown was out
of tow-n. ' Records of the commission
were presented to show that all pro
ceedings in connection with the pur
chase of the pumps were regularly
taken in open session. Moreover the
order book of the Dowa vras produced
and the entry therein showed thÂ»t work
on these pumps for general stock of
fourteen was begun January 3, 1903.
Commissioner Lloyd explained to Mr.
Ingalls that the charter required the
commission to give home manufactured
articles the preference. Mr. Ingalls,
being convinced that everything con
nected with the award of the contract
to the Dow works was fair and open,
apologized to the board for Brown's
statement.
The promotion committee yesterday
received a letter from Robert Simmons
Lee, a wealthy publisher of Boston,
ivho stated that his perusal of "Cali
fornia Addresses by President Roose
velt" left such an impression upon his
mind that he intended to purchase an
orangre orchard near Redlands.
President David Starr Jordan of
Stanford University and President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler of the University of
California have notified the California
promotion committee that they will
eerve on its advisory board. The ac
quisition of these eminent educators
means an Incalculable strengthening of
the organization that is doing so much
to advance the material interests of
this State, as each is noted for activity
in any field of endeavor he enters.
The work of the promotion commit
tee Increases apace with the publicity
attained by its purposes and methods.
The headquarters are deluged with
written Inquiries from all parts of the
United States and delegates from Ore
gon, Texas, Hawaii, Tennessee and
Louisiana have come to investigate the
methods with a view to applying them
in their respective localities.
There is a remarkable demand for
the book, "California Addresses of Pres
ident Roosevelt," published by the pro
motion committee. The work has al
ready gone through several large edi
tions and another one must be issued
to meet the demand. It has been favor
ably reviewed by more thaa 300 news
papers published outside of this State.
One Insurance company yesterday or
dered 900 copies for distribution among
its agente in all parts of the world- The
book has had a large sale at the stores
and through private orders, and the
railroad and steamship and other cor
porations interested in the advance
ment of California have boomed it ex
tensively.
Of course. If "California Addresses
by President Roosevelt" were not an
entertaining and instructive book
would not ha\*e the vogne it has at
tained. It "makes good" all that the
publishers claim for it, and its best
advertisers are the people who have
read it. President Roosevelt grasped
the salient points of the progress and
development of this State, and ex
pounded them in his characteristically
comprehensive way. So the book is not
only an invaluable medium of adver
tising California, but affords a con
spicuous illustration of American pa
tiotism.
Miss Virginia Harned appeared as a
Russian Government agent who had
been assigned the task of preventing
the transmission of a state document
from the British embassy at St. Peters
burg to the Home Office in London, and
the scene was laid in a lonely house
near Berlin, whither tne Queen's mes
senger (Mr. William Courtenay) had
been enticed by the Slav siren. She
succeeded in drugging him and obtain
ing the document, but, womanlike, re
lented when she saw that he was de
termined to kill himself rather than
face the disgrace that awaited him if
he should return to London without the
dispatch. As a medium of bringing out
the best artistic qualities of Miss Har
ned the playlet is useful, but it cannot
be honestly pronounced a valuable con
tribution to the world's dramatic liter
ature. Mr. Courtenay played the
strong- weak English gentleman with
good discretion.
The "Village Choir" quartet, from the
Orpheum, and Queen, Stowe and Feely,
acrobats from the Chutes, rounded out
the long programme.
A ONE-ACT DRAMA.
The opening number was a grotesque
acrobatic act by the three Zolars, from
the Orpheum, and then Miss Harriette
Keycs, soprano of the "Ben Hur" com
pany, sang two numbers that gave her
opportunity to display artistic control
of a really good voice. From the Tivoli
came .Principals de Spada, Welsh,
Russo, Borghese, Dado and Cortesi and
the full chorus, and they sang the glo
rious sextet from "Lucia" with an ardor
that won them a mighty curtain call.
Paul Steindorff directed the orchestral
accompaniment to this number.
A very brief intermission was fol
lowed by the appearance of Mr. Wil
liam Kelley of the "Ben Hur" com
pany, who recited "Wallace's wonderful
description of the chariot race with a
correctness of phrasing and dramatic
intensity that were rewarded with three
thunderous recalls. Then the Central
Theater corps played the strongly me
lodramatic second act of "At Valley
Forge," and after a funny turn by
Warren and Blanchard from the Or
pheum the Alcazar company dampened
the eyes of the congregation by its pa
thetic presentation of the tfcird act of
Pinero's "Lady Bountiful." The Brit
tons, a couple of clever colored people
from the Orpheum, gave a singing and
dancing "stunt" that restored gayety to
the audience, and then came the only
purely original act of the series â a one
act drama by J. Hartley Manners, en
titled "A Queen's Messenger." It was
the first production of the piece in
America.
The performance was continuous
from 2 till C o'clock, and no better In
dorsement of Its excellence was needed
than the tenacity with which the seats
were held until the final curtain. Pretty
girls from the various theaters sold
souvenir programmes, and with time
honored absence of mind neglected to
return change to the indiscreet pur
chaser who tendered any coin of less
than the denomination of'$L But. no
body protested against the overcharge,
for every one knew that all the money
taken in would be put to charitable
use. All the performers and ' stage
hands donated their services, and
Messrs. Gottlob & Marx did not charge
for the use of their theater and Its ap
purtenances, Including* lights. The aug
mented orchestra included -the famous
Orpheum Harmonium, which made its
first appearance outside of the O'Far

"Later I did duty along the coast of
Maine, and finally gratified my roving

are married men, and prefer to be sta

gain by going over to the other side is
that at the end of two years I will be
entitled to six years shore duty."

"I was first assigned to the Panther,"
said the chaplain last night, "and we
touched at nearly every port of Im
portance In Europe, going afterward to
Northern Africa and then to the West
Indiej. Immediately after the eruption
of Mont Pelee I was ordered aboard the
Dixie, and fourteen days after the
island of Martinique had been devastat
ed we landed. Such a horrifying sight as
greeted me on that day I hope' I will
never witness again. Such terrible suf
fering we beheld Is beyond description
by the pen. In fact the stories that
were, abroad of the awful disaster,
while true in the main, were far from
picturing to the mind of the sym
pathetic world the correctness of the
situation.

HOME TESTING
A Sure end Easy Test on Coffee*
To decide the all Important question
of coffee, -r nether or not It Is really, the
hidden cause of. your physical alls and
approaching fixed disease, one should
make a test of ten days by leaving off
coffee entirely and using well made
Postum Coffee.
If relief follows you may know to a
certainty that coffee has been your
vicious and killing enemy. Of course,
you can take it back to your heart
again If you like to keep sick.
A lady Bsye: "I had suffered with
stomach trouble, nervousness and terri-
ble sick headaches ever since I was a
little child, for my people were always
great coffee drinkers and let us chil-
dren have all we wanted. I got so I
thought I could not live without cof-
fee and I would not acknowledge that
it was causing my Buffering.
"Then I read so many articles about
Postum that I decided to- give It a fair
tri&L I had not used it two weeks In
place of coffee until I began to feel like
a different person. The headaches and
nervousness disappeared and wljere I
used to be Kick two or three days out
of a week while drinking coffee I am
now well and strong: and sturdy seven
days a week, thanks to Postum.
"I had been, using Postum three
months and had never been sick a day
when I thought I would experiment
and see if It really was coffee that
caused the trouble, so I began to drink
coffee again and inside of a week I
had an awful sick spell. I was so ill
I was soon convinced that coffee was
the cause of all my misery and I went
back to Postum again In a. hurry, with
the result that I was soon again well
' and strong and determined to use Pos-
tum thÂ« rest of niy days and to leave
coffee alone in the future." 1 Name given

Facts About the American Indian's
Healthy Hair.
The American Indian, accustomed
from time Immemorial to go bareheaded
In all kinds of weather. Is never troubled
with falling hair or baldness.
The close atmosphere caused by our
"civilized" headgear is conducive to the
breeding of Infinitesimal germs which
dig into the scalp and thrive on the sap
of the hair root.
This true cause of baldness is of recent dis-
covery and explains the non-success of all hair
vigors which treated baldness as a functional
disorder.
Newbro's Herpicide is a direct exterminator
of the reran "It destroys the cause and per-
mit* the hair to grow as nature Intended.

The fans will enjoy a long rest dur
ing the winter. This year we will have
no Eastern stars breaking in on our
solitude. This will be a good thing, for
the game and the players in general,
for the public sees baseball \ enough
during the progress of the league sea
son and an exhibition series, prolonged,
is likely to hurt the game in time.
8am Mertes, the noted center fielder
of the New York National League
team, Is one of the few players in the
game to-day who does not believe in
practicing. Mertes says that practice
never improves his form in the least
and: if anything it hurts both his bat
ting and fielding. Mertes Is certainly a
wonderful fielder and a headliner with
the bat, and therefore his opinion Is
worth something.
"All I want is Just enough practice to
get used to the sky and Judge the dis
tance of the field," says "Sandow."
"Whenever I start in to work hard be
fore a game I always fall down at a
critical moment. I never feel like tak
ing hold of a bat until, It is my turn
to step up to the plate, and I think the
man who tires, himself out running
after stray balls for hours every day
never appears at his best, when he is
in the game. Of course, I do not, want
to say that practice. is of no value, for
all players need a certain amount of It,
but too much hurts many players."
The strong bid for honors made by
the Portland team a few weeks ago did
not last quite long enough, so the
northern aggregation will not finish
with the first division as was expected.
At any rate, the men under the con
trol of Fred Ely have made good with
the fans of Portland by their good
sprint and perhaps if the team was
hooked up with any other aggregation
save the Angels for two weeks straight
there might have been a slight change.
Los Angeles will finish the season
with the largest per cent of victories
made by any club on this coast for
many years. Last season Oakland had
barely .600 per cent and yet the team
was considered invincible. Of course,
the Angels had everything coming'right
for them during the season and did not
run up .against adverse fortunes as
Oakland did last season. However, the
Angels played good ball throughout
and are deserving of anything they
have won.
From the baseball outlook at the
present time it would appear that San
Francisco might run about third in the
pennant race. About three weeks ago
almost any fan along the line was will
ing to bet a piece of gold against a
Frankfauter sandwich that the natives
would come in next to Portland and
Sacramento. Since that time things
have broken a trifle better for Uncle
Hank.
-An unusual number of "cans" were
seen in the upper bay, near Black
Point, last Tuesday.
E. K. Taylor, George Emmons and
others- are having difficulty with j the
owner of the Alameda "marsh -preserve
they secured for this season. 'The
thrifty; owner ; of the . land Is said to
have leased it to two different clubs. ._.
Reports from the Klamath Lake
country are to ' the effect that ducks
were ; never seen there In such num
bers as are there now. When the lake
freezes over next month these birds will
come south to delight the sportsmen
here. . ?â¢â¢;â¢
Otto Feudner, Bruce. Bonny and
George. Storey killed 134 ducks on the
Stewart *pond last Sunday.
Some members of the Field and Tule
Club visited the preserve on Wednes
day. They did not expect good shoot
ing, but J. C. Coleman secured forty
two, A. Dalton Harrison twenty-eight
and Colonel McMahon twenty-three.
Billy Murdock and E. Klevesahl en-
Joyed a good shoot on their preserve
near Tubbs Island some days since. ,
Jim MaynanJ, Ed Schultz and Pete
McCrea found the shooting poor on the
Alameda marsh last Sunday. >
James P. Sweeney was down on
Wednesday and had a good shoot. The
ducks were plentiful, but with only one
roan shooting there was nothing to
keep them in motion, or the returns
would have been larger.
The party which will go down to the
preserve to-day will Include F. S. Ju
dah, J. B. Hauer, Dr. George. G. Gere.
C. A. Bennett, J. Peltier^ L. H. Allen,
F. Blair Turpin and others. The "cans"
and bluebllls have appeared on the pre
serve and excellent sport is expected
from now on. The members are com
menting on the fact that during the
present season every variety of ducic
known on the Pacific Coast i has been
killed pn the preserve. These Include
such rare varieties as the gadwell, cm
rlamon teal and wood duck.
The extensive Improvements to the
grounds since last year in the matter
of fresh water ponds are providing an
attraction for the ducks.
The members of the Empire Gun Club
were among those agreeably surprised.
They thought conditions were against
good shooting on their Monterey pre
serve last Sunday, but 180 ducks fell to
eight guns. The shooting party was
made up of Con Roman, Dr. George G.
Gere, C. A. Bennett, Bert Patrick, Dr.
A. J. Sylvester, F. B. Surryhne, George
Batchelder and Frank Houpt. The bag
was made up principally of sprig and
widgeon. â¢ f Â¦ ;
The vagaries of ducks are beyond the
understanding of the best Informed
sportsmen. During the unsettled weath
er of the past ten days the members of
a number of clubs owning preserves
have been surprised to find conditions
on the marshes the opposite to what
they expected. When they left town
counting on a good shoot the birds
had vanished, and when they expected
no shooting the sport was at its best.
Vice Commodore Charles P. Doe
made a trip in the early part of last
week in his schooner Challenge to the
southern waters of the bay, near Bel
mont. A good sailing breeze was en-
Joyed and plenty of rail and curlew
we're bagged. Except for occasional
hunting trips the members of the Cali
fornia Yacht Club are enjoying a quiet
time.
Last Sunday some of the yacht own
ers of the California Club who have not
yet stripped their craft for the winter
were engaged at the anchorage on Oak
land Creek in drying sails. Port Cap
tain Julian Altendorf found that the
southeasterly storm had created some
work for him to do, and he was busy
most of the day.
The well-known sloop Pactolus,
which is one of the most thoroughly
equipped yachts on the bay, has been
sold by her former owner, Allen M.
Clay, to S. B. Conner of Alameda. She.
â¢will remain on the roll of the Califor
nia Yacht Club. Ex-Commodore Allen
M. Clay has been seriously -ill, but Is
recovering and expects to be out again
early next month. For the present he
has no intention of getting another
yacht, but he will probably not ' long
remain absent from his favorite recre
ation. The new owner of the sloop Pac
tolus was out for a sail on the bay
last Sunday, there being a light breeze
and favorable tide.
Vice Commodore A. C. Lee of the San
Francisco Yacht Club, owner of the
sloop Surprise, has bought the large
sloop Ariel in ' conjunction with Al
phonse Hirsch. Mr. Lee will be a can
didate for election as commodore next
year. He will retain possession of the
sloop Surprise.
Peer Tiffany, keeper of - the grey
hound studbook, announces that vol
ume 9 will go to press on January
6. All registrations and changes of
ownership should be attended to before
January 1.
The coursing at Ingleslde Park will
commence to-day at 11:30. The run
ning will be resumed to-morrow at 10:30.
The draw for the Thanksgiving Day
stake will be held on Tuesday. The
draw for the regular weekly stake will
be held Friday night. The likely win
ners to-day look to be: Beacon, Gold
Lily, Golden Rule, Idleness. Rich Ar
cosy, Yankee Boy, Belfast, Free Born,
Pure Pearl, Don Pedro, Slievenaman,
Braw'6 Hill, Roy Hughie, Little Lucy,

W. Creamer has purchased Helen
Hayes, a fast greyhound by Gold Hill-
Granvale.
P. J. McCarthy haa bought Sisklyou
from P. Mullarky. HL Dillon has re
purchased Fancy Free, by Fetter Free
rDawn. E. Leas well has Glancing Pas
ka again In his kennel.
Dupont P. Lyon. a brother of Cecil
Lyon of Texas, will Bend a string of
greyhounds in his own name to com
pete here this winter. It will be made
<up entirely of Eastern dogs. Cecil
Lyon Is Bending a string of his own
breeding.
Mr. Jackson took his string from this
'city to Oklahoma to the Waterloo and
was surprised at the . improvement in
the stock in the past two years. He
6aw twenty-five greyhounds which he
believes could hold their own'in any
company. California has long been the
home of the greyhound in America, but
in the future the breeders here must
look to their laurels, as Eastern men
are drawing on the English kennel for
greyhound blood.
Elaborate preparations are being
made for the running of the John Grace
cup at Union Park on De
cember 5 and 6. The park will be closed
.until that time, which will give the
crack greyhounds a chance to recup
erate after their hard running recently.
â¢Speed will be the factor In coursing
from now on as, with the coming of
green feed, the hares will not stand up
aa they have been doing for several
months. An unusual number of East
ern dogs will start In the Interstate
Club's big event.
Blake and Smith of Butte, Mont.,
will send Confidence. Northern Express
and Parton Imported expressly for the
"John Grace cup. Parton is by Mellor
Moor-Thoughtless Beauty and repre-
Iresents the best blood in England. He
Is said to be as fast as anything here.
The sportsmen of the Middle West
who are interested in the sport of the
leash are rapidly raising the standard
â¢of their greyhounds until they begin to
class wjth those raised on this Coast.
This is the opinion of Frank Jackson,
trainer for G. Lacy Crawford of St.
Louis.

Thomas Enrlght pleaded guilty to a
charge of robbery in Judge Cook's
court yesterday and was ordered to ap
pear for sentence this morning. His
accomplice in the crime, George Hyde.
was tried and convicted and sentenced
on September 4 to serve fifteen years
in San Quentin prison.
The crime committed by Hyde and
Enright was the holding up and rob
bing of Daniel J. Sheehan, a machinist,
of $80, on' Minna street near Fifth on
the morning of June 9. Sheehan's
cries for help were heard by Policeman
Krueger, who saw the two footpads
running away. He started in pursuit
and fired three shots to make them
stop. They were arrested on Howard
street near Fifth, a stableman assisting
the officer. They both showed fight,
but were quickly subdued. When
searched the . stolen money was 'found
upon them. They had divided it be
fore running away.
His Accomplice Is Now Serving a
Fifteen-Year Term in San
Quentin.
ENSIGHT PLEADS QTJTLTY
TO CHARGE OF BOBBERY
In the second class George Janes and
Harry Rolfe look to have the best
chance. The Hotchkiss brothers have
not played much of late and probably
will not get far along.
. In the mixed doubles tournament all
the best" women players from both
sides of the bay will participate. The
similar events held on the public courts
proved successful.
The California Club's handicap sin
gles will be one of the biggest events
of the year on the courts. It Is for
club members only and all the best
players In the club will enter. There
will be four prizes, one for each play
er reaching the semi-finals. S Entries
will close on the 25th inst. The follow
ing have entered up to the present
time:
â¢ J. D. MacGavln, F. S. Mitchell. Will
Allen, Dr. Lovegrove. A. Ames. Sidney
Smith, A. E. Beyfuss, Dr. Hill, Dr.
Noble. R. B. Daggett, W. S. Dole, Her

Bradley Wallace, R, B. Cornell, Ray
Splivalo, Homer Parker, C. G. Kuehn.
A. W. Worthington, W. F. Bull, Harry
Rolfe and Herbert Schmidt
It is extremely doubtful If. Grant
Smith, the State champion, will be able
to- play any more tournaments. Smith
has been confined to his bed all week
and his attributes his condi
tion to unusual exertions on the tennis
courts. His heart is all right at pres
ent, but another year of tournament
play would be almost sure to make
him follow, in the footsteps of George
Whitney and Louis Freeman. Smith
will play in no more .tournaments.
The next two weeks will be busy
ones on the tennis courts. Four tour
naments are scheduled, one for to-mor
row, two for Thanksgiving day and
one for the following Sunday.
To-morrow's event wlU be held on
the Golden Gate Park courts and will
be a class singles for first and fourth
class men. The Thanksgiving day tour
ney on the public courts will be an
open mixed doubles event. On the Cal
ifornia club courts there will be a han
dicap singles tournament next Thurs
day. On the park courts a week from
Sunday there will be a class singles
for second and third class players.
The first class at the park has a larg
er entry list than usual, several of the
second class men having been promot
ed. J. D. MacGavln and R. N. "Whit
ney are entered, but it is doubtful If
they will play. Will Allen and George
Baker are the strongest players out
side of these two and first class honors
should fall to one of them. In the ab
sence of Allen the last tournament was
won easily by Baker. Clarence Grif
fin did not make much of a showing
before, but may prove a surprise to
morrow.
On the links of the San Rafael Golf
Club on Thanksgiving day there will
be a handicap over nine holes for la
dles and a handicap over eighteen holes
for men. R. J. Davis of the San Ra
fael Golf Club paid a visit recently to
the San Francisco links and, In com
pany with A. S. Lilley. went round la
46. 44. total 90.
for each round of the match play
Beginning at 2 o'clock this afternoon
there will be the mixed foursomes over
eighteen holes, medal play, with handi
cap, on the course of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club. The competition will
be concluded next Saturday afternoon,
beginning at the same hour.
A lively season Is expected by the
members of the San Francisco Golf
Club. It Is probable that nearly a doz
en players will take part in the com
petitions arranged by the tournament
committee for the members of the la
dies' annex, while a score or two of
men are available for the various tour
naments in which they are interested.
On Thanksgiving day on the course
of the San Francisco Golf Club there
will be a handicap, medal play. The
scores for the first eighteen holes will
be reckoned as the qualifying rounds
of the competition for the Council's
cup for men. There will be first and
second prizes In the handicap. Com
petitors must tee oft at 9:30 or at 10:30
a. m. The players who make the low

: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20.â Barney
Oldfield clipped four-flfths of a second
off the mile record for automobiles at
Agricultural Park this afternoon, re
ducing the time from : 55 4-5 to :55 flat.
His trial against. time attracted. 10,000
people to the park. The races were giv
en by the Automobile Association of
Southern California. Oldfield expects
to reduce the record still further at to
morrow's trial.
After making a warm-up circuit of
the track, he was given the word. The
big machine, "Bullet No. 2," i leaped
into a terrific pace and rounding the
first turn appeared to be running on the
wheels of the inside ; only. -: Oldfleld did
not slacken the pace for the turns,
but drove the machine to. the extreme
outside of the track and within two feet
of the fence. The first mile was made
in :55 1-5. He gave the machine a little
more power and it slewed around the
turn of the comparatively narrow track
at a dangerous angle. The second mile
was covered in :55 flat and Oldfield
slowed up and quit for the day. He ex
pressed himself as satisfied with the
trial and said that he felt confident of
making the mile in :53 to-morrow.
! The track was in perfect condition. It
had been worked and -rolled until -it
was as smooth and as level as a billiard
table. ' The only fault Oldfleld had to
rind with it was that it was a little nar
row on the turns for the tremendous
speed of his machine. ' He did not ap
pear to slow down for that reason, how
ever, and the way he struck the curves
caused the big crowd to hold its breath
in fear of an accident." Nothing" ~oc-'
curred, however, to mar the afternoon's
sport. â¢ Â¦ â¢
The time made in the competition
races was very fast, but close finishes
were the -exception. The. winners fin
ished from one-quarter to one-half mile
in front of the field in every race.

SUMMABY OF EVENTS
ON EASTERN TRACKS
George Frawley, the Jockey, is lying
dangerously ill at a hospital in Oak
land, suffering from pneumonia.
It certainly looked as if Dr. Bernays;
if worth 30 cents, could win the mile
and fifty yard race, decided under sell
ing conditions. But the Doctor seemed
afflicted with rheumatism and made a
miserable showing. After a long drive,
Jack Martin on Man of Honor, a 10
to 1 outsider, received a neck decision
over Powell astride the 30 to 1 shot
Greenock. Lady Kent ran a fair third.
There was a lingering fear of some
sort that Bay Wonder would be downed
in the fifth race, and he was. But the
Texas sprinter ran a good race on his
California debut. He- ruled, favorite,
and after making all the running was
nabbed and led by the judges a head
by Albemarle. The latter horse had L.
Spencer in the saddle and was backed
from 7 to 6. Mildred Schultz, a con
tender for quite a way^ran third.
Backed from 7 to 5 to evens, Anvil
made a rag-time gallop of the final mile
selling affair. I. O. U. came from be
hind, leading out Dunganrion for the
place.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
"Frisco" Hoag's pony, Florinel II,
took the first event, _a Futurity course
sprint, from a field of eleven. The lit
tle gelding's odds fell from 6 to 4,- and
after moving along from fourth place
he collared and beat the favorite, Pick
away, two lengths. . Arthur Kay came
from far back, finishing third.
.Padua, on some very-' nice morning
workouts, became so higTiiy touted that
the colt was Installed a 2 to 1 favorite
for the two-year-old scramble. He did
his best, but was outclassed. Mike
Daly's colt, Judge, an 8 to 1 shot, grad
ually wore down the leaG of So) Smith,
winning easily by two lengths. Mili
tary Man finished ahead of Padua in
the show.
Surprise parties continue to be the
fad in society racing circles at Oakland
track and no doubt will continue to
be until there is a cessation of rain
and the track recovers its normal con
dition. Florinel, Judge, Man. of Honor
and Albermarle may not have figured
as well on paper, as some of the other
more fashionable entries in their re
spective races, but they won at re
munerative quotations and that is suf
ficient. Had Schwalbe and Anvil, two
stanchly supported favorites, not land
ed there is no telling what might have
happened the talent. The unpleasant
climatic conditions kept the attendance
down, but business in the ring was
brisk. .
The handicap at six furlongs, which
was worth $400 to the winner, attracted
a field of six to the post. - Schwalbe,
the I Schreiber entry, carrying 103
pounds, was poumied down from 2\% to
7, to 5, and, ably ridden by Hall, came
through all right without creating a
ripple of discord.. The black mare ap
peared perfectly at home in the slushy
going and. possessing the footing, over
Princess Titania beat Caesar Young's
mare ve^/ handily in l:lCVi. Lamasney

MAKES NEW
RECORD FOR
A MILE RUN
BRITT BEATS CANOLE IN TWENTY-FIVE FIERCE ROUNDS
Tide Turns in Favor of the Winner in Last Three
Rounds, Canole Weakening Under Punishment.
Continued on Page 18, Column 5.
CANOLE STAITDS - TTFBIGHT.
Britt's plan of campaign was to send
his left to the body, following It with a
right to the head. Brltt crouched
throughout, while Canole affected an
upright style. It waa a treat to watch
the latter's footwork which, was as be
wildering as that of a ballet dancer.
He did not seem as rugged as Britt,
but Btill took a lot of punishment The
fight showed that Canole was no two
to one shot In the betting:. He was ap
plauded as he passed the ten and twen
t round 4k marks ln safety, as there waa
tErse betting on these. Canole un
doubtedly *cted Kroggiiy in the earlier
Etages of the flght as he recovered un
expectedly after each spell. The worst
blow Britt received was a right to the
law as the twenty-first round ended.
Ct nearly, lifted him off hla feet. For
Canole was practically defenseless,
but Brltt In his eagerness to score a de
cisive victory was swinging wildly,
wasting his most effective blows.
The twenty-fourth round was all
Britt's, but Canole showed great game
ness and the ability to stand punish
ment. Britt redoubled his efforts in the
last round, but Canole was there fight
ing. Brltt had him staggering about,
but the Boston man made a dying
ptand and cent a left to the body. This
was the last blow struck in the flght.
Ileferee Welch at once pointed to Brltt
the winner.
J^ The attendance wafe unexpectedly
large, the big cars of the San Mateo
' electric line being crowded for two
hours before the contest." The pavilion
Is without windows and the air was
stifling. The gallery, which Is the beat
â¢ vantage point from which to view a
contest, was packed t to Its capacity,
even the rafters carrying their quota
of acrobatic epectatora.
For the epectators the contest was
one of the most nerve-racking: ever
seen here. First one and then the other
boxer would seem to have the lead. In
an Instant the scene would change and
the weakÂ»r man would be the ag
gressor. Canole was always the first to
lead, his favorite blow being a stiff left
jab to the head, which worried Brltt
et times.
BBITT IS OVEB ANXIOUS.
Brltt scented victory ahead and the
â¢long faces of his seconds and of his
friends commenced to relax from the
strained look they wore up to that time.
Jimmy saw Canole did not have a dan
gerous punch left in him and sailed in
viciously. He kept slamming In his
left, which up to that time had seemed
to lose Its effectiveness.
For twenty-two rounds it was any
body's flcht. First one and then the
other would caia a Blight lead. Early
in^the twenty-third round Britt Bent a
crushing left to Canole's stomach. The
glove struck Canole's glove and was
deflected, landing low. CanoJe claimed
a foul, but Brltt kept right after him
and rained a lead which he never re
linquished. The claim of foul was not
allowed.
Jimmy Britt carried off the long end
of the purse in his engagement with
Martin CanoJe last night at Colma in
one of the fiercest, most stubbornly
contested fights ever seen here.
Britt was the harder hitter, but Can
ole proved the cleverer of the two box
ers. He was in and out and seemed
never still an instant. He kept up a
continual peppering of Britt's face with
his left hand, nearly shutting the Cal
ifornian's eyes and cutting Jimmy's
face in such a manner that he will not
want to visit a photographer's for some
time. Britfln return knocked out one
*-f Canole's front teeth early in the.
fipht and the injured member bled
profusely until the end.
Round 1â Brttt assumed a crouching posi
tion, but Canole stood up. Canole poked out
his left twice and touched Brttt lightly on the
faee. Britt tried' hla famoua left for the body
and landed lightly. Canole ducked Into a left
swing and they clinched. Canole tried a shift,
but missed. Britt Â«*nt left to the head and
body and clinched. Â¦ Brltt sent a left to the
head through Canole's guard and Canole re
taliated with a left to face. Brltt Jabbed with
left and Canole kept backing away. The Bos
ton bov came back a moment later with a
straight left Jab to Brltt'B nose and Jimmy be
gan to fight wild.
Rrund 2â Britt opened up with a left to the
head and Canole countered. Canole ducked a
vlcloua left. Britt ducked a vicious left for
the head and countered hard on Canole s body.
Britt sent his right over, but was too far
away to be effective. Canole staggered Britt
with left to the Jaw. They clinched and Ca
role landed his left repeatedly on Britt b body.
Canole started using bis left like a piston rod
and kept tapping Brttt on the face.. Britt
managed to stop many with his glove but a
number of them landed on .his forehead. Ca
nole was cheered as he went to his corner.
Round 3â Canole kept Jabbing Ms left to
Brltf* face, knocking Brltfa head back and
making Jimmy angry, Brttt staggered Canole
with a hard left to the body. **â¢.}*Â»* Â»*Â»'
tried to follow It up. but Canole slipped away
from danger. Brttt followed Canole. landing
a heavy left swing on the Boston boy a head,
and the latter seemed to be in distress. Britt
eent his right over, but Canole blocked clev
erly. Canole landed a lett hard to the body.
Britt came back with a left to the body anfl
Canole countered to the head. Canole stag
gered Britt with left to the head. Britt was
the aggrersor In this round, but Canole e clever
work aroused a great deal of enthusiasm.
Round 4 â Britt was after Canole from the
tap of the gong. He planted a left on the
body while Canole kept trying for the head.
In a mlxup Canole sent a hard left to body,
doubling Brttt up. Brttt rushed Canole and
â¢ent a left to the head, 'but got a bard one In
return. Canole tried a left uppercut and then
placed his glove hard on Britt's stomach and
the crowd yelled. " Brttt tried for thÂ» body
and a right to the head had Canole a little
groggy. Canole fought . back desperately and
in thÂ« mlrup sent a hard left to the body.
Near the close of the round Brttt ' landed a
hard right on Canole's Jaw. .-â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦-
Round C â Britt forced Canole around the
ring and landed a left to the body. Canole
tried his shift > and sent a , stiff left to the
body. Canole repeated the shift a- moment
later and tried a right for the head, but Brltt
Following is a description of the flght
by rounds as seen by an expert:
THE FIGHT BY BOUNDS.
Billy Jordan announced that the
bout would be fought under straight
Marquis of Queensberry rules and that
the pair would protect themselves in
the breakaway. He also said the men
would battle twenty-five rounds and
would break at the order of the ref
eree. Referee Jack Welch was intro
duced. The bell clanged the signal for
the opening of hostilities and the pair
began fighting.
The familiar figure of Billy Jordan
was seen entering the ring at 10 o'clock,
and he was greeted with cheers by the
uncomfortable spectators. He was
immediately followed by "Cute" Eddie
Hanlon and Young Corbett, who are
scheduled to box next month before the
Hayes Valley Athletic Club. The pair
were greeted with wild cheering, and
Corbett was appealed to to make a
speech. He declined. Both lads bowed
their acknowledgments to the big
crowd and left the arena. "Sandy"
Ferguson and Jack Johnson, the
heavy-weights who are to contest be
fore the Colma Club, were also intro
duced.
Brltt looked serious as he sat in his
corner. He first took the southwest
corner of the ring and then changed
t* the northeast. After a little wait
Jimmy then went to the northwest cor-'
ner andoccupied It during the contest.
Behind Britt were "Spider" Kelly,
Tim McGrath, Curtis Richardson,
Frank Rafael and Sam Berger. Canole
had Alec Greggalns as his chief ad
viser. Harry Foley. Dave Barry and
another youth assisted him.
It was after 10 o'clock when the con
testants in the main event entered the
arena. Britt was clad in overcoat and
trousers. Canole came in dressed in
sweater and trousers and wearing a
hat.
BOXERS ENTER THE BING.
round after round Britt's body' blows
did not seem to hurt Canole, but to
ward the end he weakened perceptibly
under them.
From the tenth to the twenty-third
round the pair put up a beautiful ex
hibition. Canole blocked many of
Britt's heavy swings and used his left
hand with great skill. Britt kept forc
ing Canole and the latter was often
forced to break ground. He had Britt
guessing by the way he shifted from
right to left. Canole had Britt bleed-
Ing from the nose and from a bad cut
over the left eye in the seventeenth
round. Canole kept playlnpr for the
sore eye and landed repeatedly. Brltt
kept after his man and kept wearing
him down. At* the end of the twentieth
round the pair were fighting viciously.
Up to that time the contest was even
up. In the twentieth, twenty-first and
twenty-second rounds Britt had the ad
vantage.
Round 23 â Britt sent a left to the " body.
Canole kept backing away and shooting his
left out. Britt bored In and staggered Canole
with a rlnht on the Jaw. Canole clinched to
*ave himself. Brltt kept forcing the fight.
He landed a hard left swing on Canole's Jaw

claimed a professional manâ bachelorâ as
he opened his mall the other morning.\"I
wish to goodness my friends would stop
getting married or forget me when they
are sending out invitations. This one
means a present. I don't begrudge the
money, but I do confoundedly hate' to
have to rack my brains deciding what to
give, and nine times out of ten striking
on the wrong thing. We have bureaus
for so many purposes I think It would be
an immense saving of gray matter if

bureau where an unmarried man like me
could go and give an order for a wedding
present with the fair chance of having
something suitable selected and have
nothing more to do than pay the bill."â

Maurlo Herrera was given the de
cision over Fred Landers after ten
rounds oJ fierce fighting:. Herrera did
the cleaner punching and landed with
frequency on his opponent. Lander's
only bid for public favor was his abil
ity to assimilate punishment. He
proved a second Seiger and like the
"iron man" knew little about the art of
boxing. Landers was wild in his work.
Whenever he rushed he was off his
balance and Herrera would pick him
to pieces with rights and lefts. Her
rera showed fear during the lively mix
ups and covered a la Hanlon. Referee
McVey was slow to give his decision at
the end of the battle. He would; not
decide until he was out of the ring, and
the specators were forced to guess that
Herrera was the winner. -The battle
was a lively preliminary to the main
event..

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20.âAgricultu
ral Park was not the only place where
records were broken in Los Angeles to
day. At Chutes Park the local ball
team broke its record for poor fielding
and the Portlanders broke their batting
record for the season. It was one of
those games where one team was af
flicted with ennui and the other batted
better than it knows how. The only
feature was the batting of the entire
Portland team except Van Buren.
Spies, who played first base in place of
Dillon, was also very strong with the
stick. Score:

Poor Fielding and Good Batting on

Surprise.
The Corona, which reached^port late
Thursday night from Eureka, was more
than 12 hours late. She used all her
regular supply of coal and had burned
30 of her 60 tons of. reserve fuel before
she passed in through the Golden Gate.
Seas swept her decks and the staunch
little coaster had all she could do to
keep moving against the force of the
tempest.
The steam schooner Del Norte, which
usually comes from Crescent City In
S3 hours, arrived yesterday after 56
hours cf hard -battlinc with the ele
ments. During one stretch of 24 hours
she made only 15 miles headway. Al
though the wind piped freshly in the
harbor yesterday and at times kicked
up quite a boisterous sea, no damage
resulted to tbe shipping, as those in
charge had made good use of the ample
warning given by the United States
weather bureau.
The southeaster which has been
rollicking down the coast for several
days and which yesterday swept past
Point Reyes at the rate of 49 miles an
hour, has been giving coasting craft
a bard battle. No serious damage has
been reported, but recent arrivals from
the north all tell of high winds and
heavy head seas which made progress
slow and traveling a discomfort. '

Bed hangings are again In fashion.
The daintiest and lightest of colorings
are used for them, from white madras
nets, tambour muslins, soft Indian silk,
to brocades in all their exquisite pastel
shades. There are also the esthetic and
quaint colorings, both of design and
dye, or the more conventional patterns
that will ever retain a meed of popular
ity. The textures for the hangings are
beautiful. Tambour sets are delightful
with draperies of the same. The French
white work is exceedingly decorative,
with curtains of a much thinner ma
terial. Japanese fabrics are always
popular and can be had in pure white
with a knotted fringe or in tan or tea
colored silk edged with lace of the same
shade. Bedspreads and pillow shams
of lace over colored linings tone with
the hangings. Spreads of old hand
woven linen with borders of antique
lace are being used again by those who
are fortunate to possess them. Many
shops are showing entire spreads of
renaissance and Marie Antoinette lace,
which go so well with the flowered
chintzes. But these are costly. There
are countless other pretty and inexpen
sive designs to be seen, however. â Lon

At the regular meeting of the Building
Trades Council of San Francisco held last

â¢ The Teamsters' Union, through its
officers, filed a protest with the Labor
Council last night urging that body to
enter an objection with the Board of
Supervisors against granting the right
to erect a spur railway track from the
Belt railroad line on the city front into
a warehouse at Filbert and Sansome
streets. The protest of the Teamsters'
Union Is based on the claim that if
this sour track is constructed over 100
men will be thrown out of employment.
Lodge No. 68, International Associa
tion of Machinists, has made the fol
lowing nominations for officers of the
association for the ensuing six months:
The Indians are coming to California
to play the Perris Indians at. Riverside
on Thanksgiving day. To p!ay two or
three games would suit them better
than or.Iy one and so they are willing
to come north if the terms suit them.
If the negotiations do go through the
Indians will meet an All-California
team, drawn from California and Stan
ford universities and the Reliance
eleven. The personnel of that eleven
has not yet been given any thought,
but it is presumed that ihe universities
and club will be about equally repre
sented. It will take some time to get
such an eleven into shape, so that it
Is unlikely the game will be played be
fore Christmas or New Tears.
The Carlisle team this year is almost
as strong as the famous '93 eleven of
that school. It only lost to Harvard
by a sccre of 11 to 12 and it defeated
the Pennsylvania University b> a large
score.
The preliminary surveys for the pro
posed new football field on the Hille
g-ass tract, opposite Hearst Hall, have
been begun and a report as to the feas
ibility of a plan for building the
grounds will soon be submitted to the
executive committee of the Associated
Students. The plans for trie new field, ,
as outlined by Architect John Galen
Howard, call for the excavation of an :
area large enough for the field and sur- <
rounded by an embankment fifty feet
high. This will be done at .-in expense
of some five or six thousand dollars.
It has not yet been decided upon, but
is more than likely to meet with the
approval of the university authorities.
There is a very good chance that foot
ball enthusiasts will see the Carlisle
Indians play in Northern California
this winter. Negotiations have been
going on between the Indians and
"Pete" Smith, manager of th<> Reliance
team, for the last two weeks and the
prospects are bright for an agreement
to play a game either on Christmas or
New Year's day.

BOSTON, Nov. 20.â Samuel Gompers
will be opposed for the presidency of
the American Federation of Labor
when that organization elects officers
to-morrow. The socialist element in
the convention held caucuses during
the noon recess to-day and decided to
name Delegate Ernest Kreft of the
Philadelphia Typographical Union as
a candidate for the presidency of the
federation.
The/eature of the proceedings to-day,
the eleventh day of the convention, was
the acceptance of the report of the

on the Brewery "Workers' trouble. The
committee's report recommended that
the Cincinnati agreement, so-called, be
reaffirmed and this was done. ./;V :

CHICAGO. Nov. 20. â The demand for De
cember wheat from short interests was ex
tremely urgent owing to critical situations in
the Northwest, and with but small offerings,
the market ruled strong throughout the en
tire day. The sentiment was bullish from the
etart. higher cables and small receipts In the
Northwest being Incentives that brought out
a rood demand with the opening sales. De
cember was a shade lower to a shade higher
at 70c to 79VsC, but with active buying by
shorts and the local traders the price advanced'
rapidly. On the advance there was selling to
secure profits and some sales for short account
which resulted in the market easing off slight
ly at times, althoufh the tendency was con
stantly toward a higher level. The report Of
a big decrease in the stock at Duluth. for the
week .was an added cause of anxiety to thn
shorts, who are beginning to fear .they w411
experience considerable difficulty in securing
wheat to apply on December contracts. . A
private estimate showing, a greatly reduced
crop in the Northwest was also a bull factor.
The strength in December helped May, but
that month did not show as much advance as
the nearby delivery. After selling up to 80Hc
December closed l%o higher at SOÂ»4@8OV4c
Corn for December delivery was especially
strong, owing to a scarcity of offerlnieB, while
at the same time there was a good demand
from cherts throughout the day. December

NEW YORK. Nov. 20. â Prices of stocks re
ceived a setback to-day after a further moder
ate upward movement during the early hours
ai the session. A plausible reason for the
reaction wa* a flurry in tall money rates,
which ran up to S per cent late in the day,
<Â«iusins an apprehension that to-morrow's
Ij&nk statement might reveal tome unfajiorable
development*- So far es the currency move- |
meet cf the week is concerned there Js nothing !
to show an important lo*s of strength by the j
banks, the apparent decrease in cash being
ilrr.ired to a *ew hundred thousand dollars. I
Tfcs loss by transfers through the Bub-trtasury
end on sub-treasury operations piupet uere
almost ctfset by the receipts of n-w gold, in-
Oudln? fcreiaTi sold imported, and a small
gain on the direct Interior movement. The
last named \ras but a trace, but is regarded
ec hlelfty significant in view of the turn in
the currency indicated. The dubious point of
to-nioricw'6 bar.k statement is the loan Item.
There Â»as some lar^e callinr of loans to-day
by scverai 01 the KrÂ«;at banks, which necesal- 1
tated thi chiftlmc of leans and caused the rice I
in the money rate lo 8 per cent. The pur- j
l-osÂ« of this call or leans was explained somc
v.hat vaguely as due to eyndiccte requlre
lutr.ia, iccludlr.ft- the United States Steel

rÂ»n off to 5 pat cer.t s^aln before the close.
The crhuaratine effect upon the stock specu
lation <.f yrsterday's announcement that the
sarngtote conversion c! 1,'nlted States Steel
rre'errcd stock into second bonds would be
disciintinucd. was still manifested this morn
inÂ«. but It t\*-T.i its force in the course cr the

enormous scale. The bencs were at one time
2 points above iaÂ«t nicht, but closed with on!y
talf a no.r.t gain. Ur.tted States Steel pre-
CCncd Jell as low as IV uncitr last night, and
.â¢rade a net loci of a point. The silence In the
formal Statement of tlie â¢ 1 Â»:.-.k of operations
of the tjracicait en certain points left a busy
Held for conjecture, notably ea to the actual
i.oiainss of the bends remaining In the hands
if the eyndicaf to be marketed. The good

The fruit market was devoid of feature and
although receipts of"' all descriptions were
light, prices showed no improvement, as trade
was very quid owing to the* inclement
weather. Receipts of Grapes In small pack
ages were light, but carried-over stock was
abundant and sold at a lower range of prices.
Large open boxes from Martinez came to hand
too late for the regular trade, and the bulk of
the receipts had to bÂ« held over. Receipts, of
large Strawberries, although light, proved too
much, and several chests were sold to can
ners at the minimum quotation. Raspberries
and Longworth Strawberries were In light re
ceipt and steady. The Apple market was heav
ily.supplied and rather quiet at unchanged
rates. Supplies of other tree fruits were well
â¢jp to requiremtnts and prices were without
quotable change.
Citrus and Tropical fruits were dull and
featureless.

Ranch Eggs continue as scare* as ever, and
some dealers i are 1 selling at 65c. The heavy
handlers, however, are not generally asking
over 62 %c. because they want to keep their
floors bare In order net to get caught with a
stock on hand when the market ' turns down
ward, and- besides they want to protect their
regular customers and let them have & share
of the profits. These two interests make a
wide range In quotations, as will be seen.
Receipts were 60,700 lbs Butter, 670 I cases
E#g3 and 16,600 lbs Cheese.
There was considerably more Butter on the
market yesterday, ' and as the weather waÂ»
rainy and soft buyers were disposed to let the
market alone as far as possible and purchase
only to fill the day's needs. There iras no de
cline, but the market* was weak and sluggish,
and larffe stocks were lett on hand at the
close. Cheese continued weak and plentiful,
as usual.

three weeks ago invested $1000 for a
half interest In the Royal Soda Works,

The Searles gallery walls were bedecked
with evidences of the artist's skill. Most
all of the pictures are for sale at very
reasonable figures. Many of them have
been disposed of already. None of the
pictures, however, will be removed from
the walls until the exhibition is con
cluded on December 3.
Thjb miniature exhibition this year : has
attracted unusual attention because the
work, is original and clever. Lillie V.
O'Ryan has a superb picture of Mrs Ed
ward Sidney Rothschild and Rosa Hooper
Plotner's work shows marked ability.
Miss May Slessinger's work Is ' * of a
high order of merit, for it shows the fire
o^the true artist and the technique of a
careful worker. One of her miniatures is
the size of a dime and every detail of the
subject is carefully wrought. Work of
this sizo Is seldom t undertaken* even
among the artists of Europe, but Miss
Slessinger. finished the undertaking: with
much skill. A study of qhild life is strik
ing in both conception and execution. The
little ones are about to kiss and the up
turned lips, the expressions and the lights
and shadows make a subject that lingers
In memory.

"Lieutenant Â¦ Edger ;Â¦ never liked me,
and when I was detailed on the ambu
lance he did | me several mean tricks.

has always looked for some offense or
other that I â¢ might have" committed <in

Privates Hayes, Anderson, Sergeant
Gilbert and several others who heard
the noise of the scuffle ran to their of
ficer's rescue and soon had the pugna
cious negro under control. He was
quickly removed to the post guard
house, where he will be held. until he is
tried by a general court-martial. His
sentence will be as strong as the board
can make it, as this is not his first of
fense.
A little more than a month ago Mc-
Gee tried to shoot Luke Loverdi, who
owns the fruit stand by the post ex
change. He claimed- that Loverdi had
Insulted his wife, but Loverdi in reality
had saved him from 1 being punished
for an offense committed | at the Pre
f-ddio. An officer interfered and the-ne
gro was placed under arrest. ' He was
tried by Judge Cabariiss, who, for some
unaccountable reason, Acquitted him
and he was allowed to go free.
In speaking of his attempt to shoot
Edger yesterday, McGee said: "I did
try to shoot him, s and only wish that
the thing had been properly cocked so
that I might, have finished up the job
properly. Â¦ : . / ...
morning Thomas Hayes, a private who
works in the office, went out for a few
minutes, leaving me alone. It was then
that the negro appeared, and I tell you,
gentlemen, when he poked that .44
Colt's into my face it looked like a
ten-inch sun to me. He tried several
times to fire, but as luck would have
it the gun was safety cocked. As soon
as I could gather my wits I grappled
with him and tried to take his gun
away, but as he is about twice my size
he soon overpowered me and took to
hitting, me on the head with, the butt
end of his gun."

"McGee has during the last . few
months given me several occasions to
reprimand him; and I suppose that
when I told him he would be court-mar
tialed he was so Infuriated that he lost
all control of himself. At 10:10 this
This statement doubtless made Â¦ Mc-
Gee furious, for he flew out of the of
fice, only to reappear an , hour later,
when Edger was alone- and make the
attempt on, his life.
Lieutenant Edger told the following
story of the assault:
The rules of the hospital are that en
listed men are allowed three all.-night
passes a week and two midnight passes.
McGee had/been given a 12 o'clock pass
for the night before, but, as customary
with him, reported at the Â¦ hospital
twenty-five minutes late.
When Lieutenant Edger took charge
of the office at 9 o'clock yesterday
morning he immediately consulted the
report book and found that McGee was
twenty-five minutes late. He called for
McGee to explain his tardfness, and
when the negro appeared he com
plained that Edger was â¢ prejudiced
against him and that he could â¢not get
a square deal. Edger asked 'him if .he
was going to take the management of
the hospital in his own hands. McGee
stated that he was not, but that he
wanted to do. what was right. Edger
replied that the only way. to make Mc-
Gee do what was right .would be' to
give him a summary court-martial.
Edger further- told him that he could
consider himself booked for a sum

Considerable excitement was caused
at .the Presidio yesterday morning
when Private. Clark McGee attempted
to kill Lieutenant Benjamin J. Edger,
executive officer of the General Hospi
tal of the post.
McGee is a brawny negro and has for
some time driven the ambulance, but
recently he was transferred to dut y at
the hospital, where he has been up to
the time of his arrest yesterday. . He
has a bad reputation in the army and
has on several occasic-ns shown a read
iness to shoot' those he dislikes, but
none of his officers ever expected that
he would assault them, .because , the
penalty for assault is life' imprison
ment.
Since that, time' the girl has been
married, and has been striving to forget
the past... On "Wednesday night she
met Burness. at Market and Sixth
streets and to her surprise he asked
her to live with him -again. "When she
refused he- threatened to kill her, say
ing as she left him -.-"Well, 111 get you
this time, sure."
Burness was arrested for this offense
yesterday" afternoon by Policeman
Winzler on Sixth street and booked at
the City Prison. Â¦ -
Mrs. Sterling at that time was Miss
Clara Hastings. She had been living
for four years with Burness and left
.him about two months previous. He
, had begged her to return to him sev
; eral times, but she refused. On the
day mentioned she called with her lit
tle girl upon "her sister, Mrs. Annie St.
Clare at 1119 Mission street. Burness
had followed her and was permitted to
enter the apartments of the St. Clares,
as he had brought an album and other
effects belonging to Miss Hastings.
They had chatted for a few minutes
when Burness again. asked the girl to
return to him and she again refused.
He drew a revolver out of his pocket
and pointed it at the girl.
The trigger snapped twice before St.
Clare grappled with Burness, who was
much the larger man. Burness tried
to shoot St. Clare and after a despe
rate struggle St. Clare succeeded In
wresting the weapon from him and
broke away from him.
Burness grabbed hold of the girl, and
after throwing her to the floor pro
ceeded to choke her. St. ,CIare armed
himself with a hammer and beat Bur
ness on the head with it till Burness
released his hold of the girl and grap
pled with St. Clare. Mrs. St. Clare and
her sister ran out of the room scream
ing for help. Meantime Burness and
St, Clare continued their struggle till
St. Clare broke away and ran out of
the room. Mrs. St. Clare returned and
Burness attacked her. She screamed
for help and Chris Hanson, a roomer in
the house, went to her assistance. Bur
ness, In . trying to escape, stepped on
a shelf on the rear window and fell a
distance of twenty feet, fracturing his
skull.
St. Clare was arrested for assault
with a deadly weapon by Detective
Reynolds, but after Burness showed
signs of recovery the case against him
was dismissed on January 6. No action
was taken against Burness, as he prom
ised faithfully not to annoy the girl
again. ' â¢ 'â¢ " .

MAKES THREATS
AGAINST WOMAN
Miss Dwyer's attempt to swear out a
warrant for the arrest of Superintend
ent of Schools Langdon on Thursday
Â«n the allegation that the latter had
perjured himself caused widespread as
tonishment in school cricles yesterday.
President Woodward of the Board of
Education is at a loss to know in what
way Langdon could possibly have per
jured himself in the case.
"Superintendent Langdon simply in
vestigated the charge against Miss
Dwyer," said Woodward, "and after
taking the evidence of many witnesses
referred the matter to the Board of
Education for a trial of Miss Dwyer on
the charge. Mr. Langdon further re
ported that Miss Dwyer had refused
to make a statement to him regarding
the chastisement of the pupil on the
ground that the legal guardian of the
boy had not preferred the charges. I
fail to see how Langdon could have
perjured himself."
Miss Dwyer yesterday notified Super
intendent Langdon that she had sus
pended Frank Dulgnan, the boy she
punished, for one week. Miss Dwyer
states on the suspension blank as the
cause for the suspension: "Open defi
ance of my authority and insulting lan
guage," and winds up with the state
ment, '"I wish him expelled."
Miss Dwyer visited the Grand Jury
room in the afternoon and desired to
bring the matter of her removal before
the inquisitorial body. The Grand Jury
Bent out word that It was too busy to
take up Miss Dwyer's plaint, and asked
her to call again. Miss Dwyer hovered
around the corridors of the City Hall
for some time, but finally took her de
parture.
Under the terms of the resolution
dismissing Miss Dwyer she will retire
from her acting principalshlp on Mon
day next. The board did not appoint
her successor, because Miss Coles, the
regular principal of the school, will re
turn from her leave of absence next
January, when she will resume her du
ties as principal. Miss J. H. Gillespie,
the ranking teacher in the school, will
act as principal until Miss Coles' re
turn.
Miss Jean A. Dwyer, who was dis
missed from her position as acting
principal of the South End School for
chastising a pupil, began retaliatory
measures yesterday by filing charges
against Miss J. H. Gillespie, one of the
teachers in the school. The communi
cation, which is very short, was filed
with the Board of Education, and in
it Miss Dwyer charges the teacher
named with insubordination and with
having insulted her.
Miss Dwyer does not enter into the
details of the alleged insubordination
and insult, but goes on to say that she
had submitted the particulars of the
matter to Superintendent Langdon on
September 15 last. Miss Dwyer con
cludes her communication by stating
that she will swear to the charges be
fore a notary public.
Lanpdon says he recalls that
Miss Dwyer informed him that she
had ordered Miss Gillespie to do some
thing and the latter refused to obey,
but Miss Dwyer did not prefer any
written charges against the teacher.
Desertion is charged in the action
commenced by Eva Greer against Na
than Greer.
A suit for divorce on the ground of
desertion was filed yesterday by An
drew J. Weir against Margaret Weir,
the plaintiff alleging that his wife left
him and her two children in March,
1895, seven years after their marriage.
Neglect is the charge brought by Con
stance Campbell against George Camp
bell. She alleges that for more than a
year he has not supported her or their
two children. They were married In
1899.
Judge Sloss made an order directing
Rudolf Lorenz to pay to his wife, Fran
zeska Lorenz, $15 a month. She sued
him for $40 a month separate mainte
nance. Judge Sloss also made an order
awarding Mary Heidewald $20 a month
pending the trial of her suit for divorce
against William P. Heidewald, a sales
man.
Musician XV. E. Sharp, formerly lead
er of the orchestra in the Orpheum at
Honolulu, wants a divorce from Amelia
Sharp, once a variety actress, on the
ground of Infidelity. He accuses her
of forgetting her marriage vows sev
eral times during the last two years,
both in this city and San Jose, though
he confesses that he does not know the
names of his rivals. His attorneys are
Albert and Hiram Johnson.
Mrs. Refenburg, Mrs. Strong's moth
er, corroborated her daughter's testi
mony and volunteered the information
that Strong, at the time of his mar
riage to her daughter, was engaged to
another woman, and that he deserted
his bride because he feared that this
woman would make trouble for him.
Judge Troutt granted Mrs. Strong an
interlocutory decree on the ground of
willful neglect.
Bertha Zambelich was married to
Martin Zambelich July 17, 1902. Ac
cording to her complaint for a divorce
her husband pave her such a beating
on the night of their marriage that she
went into convulsions and was com
pelled to send for her mother, who ar
rived at her home~at 5 a. m. and re
mained with her until she recovered
from the effects of her husband's al
leged brutality. A few weeks later,
avers the plaintiff, her husband again
attacked her, dragged her about by
the hair and scratched her .with his
fingernails until there was hardly a
spot on her body that was not bruised,
bleeding and sore. She also complains
that since she became Mrs. Zambelich
her husband has developed the habit
of remaining out at night and refuses
to explain his absence. Mrs. Zambe
llch's maiden name was Strauss and she
wants to resume it. Her husband is
a news agent in the employ of the
Denison News Company.
MUSICIAN WANTS DECREE.
Very short and bitter was the matri
monial experience of Florence Strong.
She testified in Judge Troutt's court
that she was married to Dwight
Strong, assistant librarian of the Oak
land Public Library, a widower with
two children, on February 2 of last
year, and that the day following he
sent her home to her mother, refusing
ever since to contribute to her support.
FEARED ANOTHER WOMAN.
Charles H. Grant, one time command
er of the army transport Sherman and
now in command of Howard Gould's
yacht Niagara, one of the largest
yachts on the Atlantic, was denied a
divorce from Florence Grant yesterday
in Judge Hebbard's court. He failed
to establish to the satisfaction of the
court that he had ever established a
residence here and the court granted
Mrs. Grant's motion for nonsuit. She
was represented by Attorney Garret
McEnerney.
The Grants were married at Ports
mouth, N. H., in August. 1874.' The
captain came out here In 1898 and took
command of the Sherman. In his com
plaint for divorce he alleged that in
1900 he wrote to his wife and asked her
to join him and that she refused. He
then brought the suit. on the ground of
desertion.
This did not suit Mrs. Thorrold, Mrs.
Sinclair and Mrs. Richards, and they
immediately commenced proceedings to
remove Arthur as executor, alleging
that he had taken advantage of hl3
mother's alleged mental weakness and
so manipulated the estate that he
would be benefited at the expense of
the others.
The case was heard by Judge Troutt,
who decided that Arthur Davies was
a capable manager, that Mrs. Davies
was not an incompetent and that the
fortune of Davies was safe in his son's
hands.
For thlÂ£ reason, and because they
fear that the disgruntled sisters will
again attempt to prove their charges
that their mother was dominated by
her sons and Mrs. Moran and that she
is an incompetent, they ask that the
testimony of Mrs. Davies be perpetu
ated. Upon the filing of the petition
Judge Troutt issued an order directing
Notary Public A. J. Henry to take the
testimony of Mrs. Davies next Friday.
Davies died several months ago, leav
ing an estate of considerable value.
It consisted principally of the business
of the Truckee Box and Lumber Com
pany. In his will* he left it all to his
widow, with the exception of a bequest
of $5 to each of his children. lie
named his widow and his sons, Arthur
and Llewellyn, as executors. The wid
ow and Llewellyn declined to serve and
Arthur was appointed.
With the consent of his mother he
incorporated the Davies Box and Lum
ber Company, and she transferred to
the new corporation the business of
the Truckee Box and Lumber Company
and gave to Arthur and Llewellyn each
a third of the stock, they agreeing to
work for a small salary until they had
each put into the business the sum of
$10,000.
COMMENCE PROCEEDING.
A petition to perpetuate the . testi
mony of Jane Davies, widow of the
late Llewellyn Davies, the "lumberman,
filed yesterday by Mrs. Davies and Ar
thur, Llewellyn and Richard Davies
and Amelia Moran, four of her chil
dren, reveals the fact that the rela
tions between the petitioners' and Eliza
Thorrold, Sarah E. Sinclair and Rosa
Richards, the other children of Mrs.
Davies, are still strained, and that the
recent decision of Judge Troutt has not
by any means settled the family quar
rel over the Davies estate.
The petition is the result of the fears
of the petitioners that Mrs. Thorrold,
Mrs. Sinclair and Mrs. Richards intend
to enter into extensive litigation over
their father's fortune. They say that
at the recent hearing of the suit to re
move Arthur Davies as executor of his
father's^ will, on the ground* that he
was using the estate for his own ben
efit, it was shown conclusively and
proved by the decision of the court that
the young man was. innocent of any
wrong-doing.
