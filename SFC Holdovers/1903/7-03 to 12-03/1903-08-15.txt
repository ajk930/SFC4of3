KINGSTON. Jamaica, Aug. 14.â There
are heartrending scenes throughout this
island. At Port Antonio thousands of
homeless and starving residents have
sought shelter in the old prison and the
few other buildings whicn survived the
hurricane. Those who could. not be thus
accommodated are cowering in the lee of
ruined walls and dismantled piazzas. The
railroad sheds and waiting-rooms are
filled with women and children. The mer
chants are feeding the hungry to the best
of their ability, bu,t the majority are sub
sisting on the unripe bananas knocked
down by the storm. The bananas are
boiled in oil cans over open fires made
from the debris of destroyed buildings.

years ago. She was to-day apprised of
the report that her husband had married
a Milwaukee' girl in California. She is

a letter from her; husband, who is filling

notifying her. that, his engagement would

that Jie would at once thereafter start

" Mrs. Livingston is the daughter of L.

are traveling left Salt Lake City yester
day morning and is due to arrive some
time this afternoon.
In Grand Army circles yesterday many
of the war veterans were of opinion that
even if General Miles was not a candi
date for the post of commander In chief
he would surely announce himself as .-a
candidate on the Democratic ticket for
the Presidency of the United States.
It was argued that General Miles would
have the entire support of the Grand
Army- in his aspirations for the White
House by giving way to General ' Black
as candidate for commander in chief of
the veterans. .

General Miles arrived at'Salt Lake City
at 2 a. m. yesterday and he was met at
the depot by a delegation of officers from
Fort Douglas. He was escorted to the
military post and there entertained by
the army men.
General Miles stated In most .positive
manner, while at Salt Lake City early yes
terday morning, that he would not be
come a candidate for election as com
mander in chief of the Grand Army and
that he would support the nomination of
General Black for the coveted honor.
Despite many statements that General
Miles would be a candidate' in opposition
to General Black for the position as chief
of the Civil War veterans, the statement
of General Miles to the' contrary, made
yesterday at Salt Lake City, settles the
important matter.

This Is their sole food supply and it will
be exhausted In nine or ten days.
Similar conditions prevail at other sea
ports. In the interior the distress is
equally acute. Scarcely a peasant's homfe
is standing. Even the planters' dwellings,
which are built of stone, have been un
roofed, with few exceptions.
The homes and the belongings of the
peasants have been blown away and they
are contriving rude shelters from fallen
trees, palm boughs and banana leaves.
Owing to the continued unsettled weather,
with occasional torrential rains, these
shelters afford little protection.
Efforts were made at Kingston to relieve
the immediate wants of some towns by
subscriptions of food and clothing, but
the local efforts are inadequate. Unless
immediate shipments of foodstuffs come
from America, death by starvation is in
evitable for many.
The hospitals in the wind-swept regions
are crowded with the injured, and the
death list is increasing.
Some quarters have not reported. One
man was beheaded at Port Antonio by a
flying sheet of galvanized roofing. Many
were seriously injured by falling houses,
trees and walls. Several houses , on the
banks of streams were carried away by
flood water. The fate of their inmates
is unknown, but It is feared that there
have been many deaths from this cause.
The bulk of the Blue Mountain coffee
has been ruined and the plnmento groves,
which had stood for centuries, have been

parts of the island, where houses were
torn down, trees uprooted, crops ruined,
vesels driven ashore and many persons
killed or Injured. A dozen houses at
Robert collapsed and many of the small
houses in the neighborhood were de
stroyed. Three persons were killed and
eight Injured.

DUTIES OF THE CHIEF.
St-cretary Root will promulgate an order
affecting the duties of the general staff of
the army, which under the new law goes
Into effect August 15. On the selection
and duty of the chief of staff the Secre
tary says:
"Under the act of February 14, 1903, the
command of the army of the United
States rests with the constitutional com
roander in chief, the President. The Pres.
Ident will place the parts of the army and
separate armies whenever constituted un
der commanders subordinate to his gen
eral command, and in case of exigency
seeming to him to require It he may place
the whole army under a single command
er subordinate to him. but in time of
peace and under ordinary conditions the
administration and the control of the
army are effected without any second in
command.
"The President's command Is exercised
through the Secretary of War and chief
of staff. The Secretary of War Is charged
â¢with carrying out the policies of tht Pres
ident In military affairs. He directly rep
resents the President and is bound always
to act in conformity to the President's in
structions. Under the law and the de
cisions of the Supreme Court his acts are
the President's acts and his directions and
orders are the President's directions and
orders.
The chief of staff reports to the Secre
tary of War, acts as his military adviser,
receives from him the directions and or
ders given in behalf of the President and
gives effect thereto in the manner here
inafter provided.
"Exceptlons to this ordinary course of
administration may. however, be made at
any time by special direction of the Pres
ident if he sees fit to call upon the chief
of staff to give information or advice or
receive instructions directly,.
PERSONAL ACCORD.
"The chief of staff is detailed by the
Presiflent from officers of the army at
large 'not below the grade of brigadier
penwtl. The successful performance of
the datJes of the position requires what
the tille denotes â a relation of absolute
confidence and personal accord and sym
pathy between the chief of staff and the
President and necessarily also between
the chief of staff and the Secretary of
War. Tot this reason, without any reflec-
tlon whatever upon the officer detailed,
the detail will in every case cease unless
sooner itt-rminated on the day following
the exrtratJon of the term of office of the
President by whom the detail is made,
ar.d If iX any time the chief of staff con
t-Mers that he can no longer sustain to
ward thfc President and Secretary of War
the relaions above described, it will be
his dutji to apply to be relieved."
The c^neral staff wiy become an ad

prepare plans for the organization and

tion and make preparations for plans of

strongly urges the Government to deliver
the Macedonians from the Turkish yoke.
LONDON* Aug. 15.â The Daily Mail
prints a dispatch from Belgrade which
says that several thousand Albanians
have marched to reinforce the Turkish
troops, who have recaptured Xrushevo
and have massacred the entire Christian
population. The Mohammedans in sur
rounding villages surrendered their arms
to the Bulgarians.

the Christian village of Karbonstza and
have slaughtered its inhabitants.
Dispatches received by the Porte give
particulars of a number of encounters
with insurgents. The latter attacked the
village of Gumenke. throwing bombs Into
it, but official dispatches say they were
repulsed. The foreign representatives
have demanded of the Porte protection
for the Consuls and foreign residents at
Monastir. The Grand Vizier has promised
effective measures of protection.
The Mussulmans in the disturbed area
are persistently demanding arms and am

CONSTANTINOPLE. Aug. 14.â The im

Owing to the continued unsettled weather,

Into effect August 15. On the selection
and duty of the chief of staff the Secre
tary says:
"Under the act of February 14, 1903, the
command of the army of the United
States rests with the constitutional com
roander in chief, the President. The Pres.
Ident will place the parts of the army and
separate armies whenever constituted un
der commanders subordinate to his gen
eral command, and in case of exigency
seeming to him to require It he may place
the whole army under a single command
er subordinate to him. but in time of
peace and under ordinary conditions the
administration and the control of the
army are effected without any second in
command.
"The President's command Is exercised
through the Secretary of War and chief
of staff. The Secretary of War Is charged
â¢with carrying out the policies of tht Pres
ident In military affairs. He directly rep
resents the President and is bound always
to act in conformity to the President's in
structions. Under the law and the de
cisions of the Supreme Court his acts are
the President's acts and his directions and
orders are the President's directions and
orders.
The chief of staff reports to the Secre
tary of War, acts as his military adviser,
receives from him the directions and or

gives effect thereto in the manner here
inafter provided.
"Exceptlons to this ordinary course of

of staff to give information or advice or
receive instructions directly,.
PERSONAL ACCORD.
"The chief of staff is detailed by the
Presiflent from officers of the army at
large 'not below the grade of brigadier
penwtl. The successful performance of
the datJes of the position requires what
the tille denotes â a relation of absolute
confidence and personal accord and sym

President and necessarily also between
the chief of staff and the Secretary of
War. Tot this reason, without any reflec-
tlon whatever upon the officer detailed,
the detail will in every case cease unless
sooner itt-rminated on the day following
the exrtratJon of the term of office of the
President by whom the detail is made,

Jim came off unscathed. They were proud
of Jim and expressed their feelings.
Jeffries was also surrounded by a large
crowd- in his dressing-room. He chatted
with John â¢ Considine, : who came from
Portland to see the fight, and also ex
changed repartee with his trainers and
friends. His nose was puffed and a slight
swelling of the lips showed where j Cor

$30 from one of his friends and gave it to

always acted as his mascot. Miller was

James J. Jeffries, Who Retains World's Championship by Beating James J. Corbett in Battle at Mechanics' Pavilion.
When Nat Goodwin and his stage man

said in a cheery voice: "I did the best I
could, Nat, but he was too strong for
me." "You put up a great flght," replied
After the fight Corbett was surrounded
in hits dressing room by a large crowd
of friends. He was irritable, but tried to
pass off his feeling by chaffing with his
friends. He etill suffered pain In the
region of the stomach wher* Jeffries' fists
had landed and he demanded a rub-down
While being looked after by his trainer".
Jim chatted with his friends. He received
hearty hand shakes from them and they
pleased him greatly by praising him for
the splendid fight he made.
Throughout the fight the champion was
like a big good-natured bear conscious of
his strength and fearing no harm from
the man who faced him. His amiability
deserted him for but a moment and that
was when he espied Tomrfyy Ryan among
Corbett's seconds. He gave Ryan a
sneering look and then apparently ban
ished him from his thoughts. Â¦Â¦. He was
pmJUrig throughout. Once in /his play
fulness he reached over and tapped Kef
cree Graney lightly on the face.
In the fourth round Jeffries' left-hand
glove ripped at the thumb and the pad
ding slipped out. The referee called for
a new glove. When the minute Interval
expired the glove had not been replaced
and Corbett remained In his corner. The
extra rest at this time benefited him.
From the out*et there seemed no pun
ishing power in Corbett's blows, none of
them making any impression upon Jef
frie*. Corbett's best showing was in the
eighth and ninth rounds, when he pep
pered Jeffries with jolty rights and lefts,
but without taking any of the speed out
of Jeffries. Previous to that he was
"(Â¦tailing," he said, thinking Jeffries was
not in the best possible condition and that
his oxcrtiops would tire him. His hopes
Â¦were toon shattered, as there was no
slackening of speed apparent in Jeffries'
work.
Jeffries went at Corbett in earnest in
the tpnth and what proved to be the last
round. He sent a jolty left to the head
and followed it up with a crushing left
to the body. Corbett Bank down slowly
and gazed vacantly out of what seemed
sightless eyes. There was a look of
agony on his face as he groped about on
his hands and knees. He first located
Jeffries standing nearly over him and
then turned slowly toward the time
keepers. He was up at the count of nine
but he was defenseless and at the mercy
of Jeffries. The latter feinted at Corbett
and then ripped in his terrible left to the
body. The blow was almost identical
with the blow Fitzsimmons knocked him
out with at Carson. It landed on the
body slightly to the right of the center
and seemed to paralyze his nervous sys
tem. He fell to his knees again and
clutched at his side, apparently in terrible
pain. Ills face worked convulslvely,_his
features being distorted. Tommy Ryan
tossed a big palm leaf fan into the ring
to save Corbett from further injury. Cor
bett staggered to his feet but was bent
double with pain. He maintained this po
sition until his seconds took him a chair.
He sat down but remained doubled up,
his hands nearly touching the floor. Jef
fries finally approached him and they
shook hands. Corbett acknowledged de
feat gracefully, saying Jeffries was too
big and too strong for him.
GOOD-NATURED BEAR.
JAMES J. JErFRIES gallantly de
fended his title to -the heavy
weight boxing champtonship last
night in Mechanics' Pavilion. He
. stopped James J. Corbett in ten
rounds. The latter was helpless and un
able to defend himself, so Tommy Ryan,
his chief second, tossed a big palmleaf
fan into the ring, acknowledging defeat.
Jeffries was the master fcf the situa
tion from the first tap of the gong until
the end. To the intense surprise of the
spectators he outboxed Corbett from the
start. Corbett either did not try to stay
away or could not stay away owing to
the speedy footwork of Jeffries. He
fought in close and, while he escaped
some torrible swings, he was badly pun
ished with short arm blows. Either he
had lost all his vaunted skill as a boxer '
or Jeffries' improvement over his recent
fights was so marked as to totally eclipse
last night's efforts of Corbett. They had
been boxing but a few moments In the
first round when the experts af the ring-
Bide saw there could be but one possible
outcome to the contestâ that Jeffries must
win ultimately. It then became only a
matter of surmise as to how long Cor
bett could withstand the rushes and the
terrible blows of the giant who was after
him so relentlessly.
FLASH OF OLD-TIME FORM.
Corbett's flash of his old-time form in
the eighth round set his devoted adhe
rents yelling as they thought he had cut
Jtffrics down to his size and had at least
an o\-en chance. In the early part of the
round Jeffries was, as usual, forcing mat
ters, landing on the body and head. Cor
bett then became the aggressor, sending
& hard right to the head. He uppercut
Jeffries with his right and then scored
an uppercut in a clinch.
Jeffries commenced roughing it when
the ninth round opened. He threw his
Fhoulder into Corbett with a force as
hard BJ any blow from his gloves. He
scored with a left to the head and a
right and left to the body. Corbett came
back fighting, landing first a right to the
body and then a right and left to the
head. Jeffries missed a blow for the body,
'"orbctt scored while they were clinched
Ju?t as the bell rang. The spectators con
tinued to cheer Corbett.

NOTABLES PLENTY.
When at 8:20 two sprouts of boxers
poked their heads through the ropes and
picked corners, a vacant seat on the main
floor was scarcely discernible, and the
mass of impatient humanity presented a

JEFFRIES was too big and
too strong for me. 1 was
in perfect condition. Sci
ence cuts no figure when
you are against a man of
Jeffries' bulk, ke hit me in
the body in the' second round
and it took all the fight out of
me. I saw that I was losing
my strength and I tried to give
the people a run for their
money. He had youth and
strength in his favor and I was
all in. For a couple of rounds
it was nip and tuck, but he was
too big and strong. I saw that
if I ran away from him I would
tire myself. I therefore slugged and tried that way. I had him
tired in a couple of rounds. I told my seconds after the
second round that I was all in, but nevertheless he could not
put me out. I kept jollying him and told him he would have
to put me out and he tried time and again to do so. I did
my best and I hope every one is satisfied. I understand he '
was in. perfect condition tc-night. It is never my luck to get
a man out of condition. The blows he landed on my body
did the trick. The oxygen used on me after each round re
freshed me and my wind was perfect, but I could not assim
ilate his terrible blows.â -James J- Corbett.
CORBETT SAYS HE WAS GIVEN
DAMAGING PUNCH IN SECOND
I DID not have much to say
before the fight: Corbett had
it all his Own way. There was
never a moment in; the con
test that I was in danger. I
knew Corbett was tired and my
strength was increasing. I
knew it was only a matter of
time when I would get him. I
thought I had him in the sec
ond round. The blow I landed
was a terrific body punch and
would have settled any other
man. He surprised me by con
tinuing. I have always stood
ready to defend my title
, against any man in the .world.
I bar negroes, however. If Jack Monroe wants to fight me
I am ready to make some easy money. I gave Corbett my
head frequently in the fight, in order that he would hurt his
hands. Corbett's showing surprised me. I was much faster
to-night and in better condition tfian I was at our former
meeting. Corbett had lots of steam behind his punches, but
he never feazed me. He made the kind of a fight I like. I
was afraid he would keep away. I am now going home and
eat a big watermelon. Corbett tried to "kid" me during the
fight, but I laughed at him. I knew he could not beat me
and I did not hurry myself. â James J. Jeffries.

â¢"The crowd began to arrive before 7, and
from, that time on one long line of men
was constantly 'streaming into the big
building. The doors to the gallery were
opened at C o'clock and that portion of
i._e pavilion was filled hours before. the
fighters entered the ring.
A large squad of police officers was de
tailed to the scene of the fight early in
the evening and the crowd wtJb well
handled. There was no disturbances to
speak of and all trie hangers-on behaved
themselves in a most orderly manner.
The police kept patrolling the street in
front of the pavilion and any person who
was not in possession of a ticket was
quickly hustled away from the door.
The Yosemite Club incidentally lost
many a dollar on this score. Many tick
ets, snapped up eagerly by some of the
grafters, went to waste and many a

square thing by the sporting public It
would have been a large sum further

Every time a cheer went up it was a
signal for the surging mass in the street
to press closer to the doors and strain
its ears for some more of the anxiously
awaited intelligence. Great enthusiasm
was manifested by the â¢ hangers-on and
they varied the monotony of hours of
waiting by making small wagers or dis
cussing the respective prowess of the two
heavy-weight gladiators.
And it was rather a gloomy outlook
for the bevy of ticket scalpers, who went
through the crowd In their vain attempt
to dispose of their wares. The people

Professor DtoÂ«e,- who had charge of Cor

visited at Croll's Gardens. Alameda, re
cently by Drs. Keys and Buteau, two of
the moFt prominent practitioners in Ala
meMa County. After they had been shown
the various appliances used by Corbett
in building up his muscular system they
j-uggested the use of oxygen as being
more sanitary than the usual methods
employed. Professor Dare at once pro
duced the apparatus he had intended to
use and the three men discussed the mat

A new wrinkle in caring for a man dur
ing the nWnute of rest in each round was
brought out last night by Corbett's han
dlers. â¢ Instead of seconds waving fans
and towels and stirring up the vitiated
air in the pavilion. Corbett had an im
mense tank of oxygen concealed under
the ring platform in his corner. To this
was attached a long rubber tube on the
fnd of which was a spraying machine. As
Corbett returned to his corner each Urn*
a stream of oxygen was sprayed on his
face. It had a remarkable revivifying
effect.
While the gloves were being put on Jef

the Olympic Club amateur boxer, who
trained with Corbett. Berger's attention
was called for an instant by friends at
the ringside, but Sammy declined to keep
his eyes off Jeffries, as he feared they
might slip a horseshoe in Jeffs right

look at Cnrbctt's splendid proportions.
Jim's skin looked healthy and his bulk

Beside Jeffries' swarthy skin, Corbett
looked like a piece of marble.

little tired, but his natural strength came back to him, and he
proved much stronger than his opponent. I was surprised v to
see Corbett come back after being knocked down in the second
round. The blow was a terrible one. He received another
hard one near the close of the ninth round, and I knew it was
all over. Corbett stalled cleverly, but had to succumb to the ter

IT was the best heavy-weight
contest I have ever seen.
' Both men fought fairly^ and
with great determination.
It is true that they tried to ,
sneak a punch in the clinches,
but they did not transgress the
rules. The punches Corbett re
ceived in the body hurt him.
Jeffries showed wonderful im-,
provement. He fought better
and faster than he did when he
met Fitzsimmons in this city.
He even hit harder and his
blows had more direction. Cor
bett was extremely clever. He

PUT UP A SPLENDID BATTLE
When Jeffries Landed the Punch Which Dispelled Forever the Dream of Corbett to Regain the World's Championship
lA/IINlNEFR PROVES
The second preliminary was even more
exciting. Jack Evans of the Hayes Val
ley Athletic Club knocked out Jim Fair
hanks in the second round after being
practically beaten. Evans showed great
pameness and was heartily applauded for
his work. Fairbanks had the advantage
in reach, and he was able to land some
heavy swings on Evans' head. Evans
was game and returned the blows in kind.
In the second round Fairbanks set the
pace and had Evans groggy. Fairbanks
dropped the latter with a swing on the
head, Evans was up and half a minute
later repeated the trick, and the crowd
howled. Fairbanks got up, but he had
phr.t his bolt. He was sent down and
staved down.
The sixth round was as fast as the
opening of the contest. Both strove to
land a decisive punch, but were wild in
their attempts. At the close of the bout
Barry called It a draw and was hooted for
his decision.
HARRY SHERIDAN of San Ra
fael and Frank Smith of Los An
geles put up elx rounds of fact
fighting. The bout was Just the
kind to satisfy the Immense
crowd. It proved an* appetizer for the
main go. Sheridan was smaller than his
opponent, and despite his size was the
aggressor throughout the battle. Dave
Barry was referee, and his decision of a
draw* did not meet with the crowd's ap
proval.
In the opening round Sheridan bored in
and swung some heavy rights on Smith's
head. Smith came back, but swung- wild
ly. In the second the little fellow stag
gered the Los Angeles youth with a right
on the Jaw. Sheridan was again the ag
gressor In the third. Smith's long reach
and greater strength availed him, and he
Â¦was able to withstand Sheridan's rushes.
Both youngsters fought fast and the
crowd was delighted. They hammered
each other all over the ring. Sheridan
having the best of it. Sheridan drew
Wood In the fourth and had Smith guess
ing. The fifth round was full of slug
ping. Sheridan used a back-handed left
and followed it with an uppercut that
made Smith see all the lights In the build
ing.

Small Amount of
Coin Wagered
â¢ on Fight.
THERE was practically very little
money bet on the fight la the lo
cal poolrooms. The heaviest
money wagered was by friends of
Jeffries who came up from South
ern California to see the champion win.
To all his friends Jeffries gave out the
tip that he could not lose and'to bet all
they had on him. Ills manager, "Kid"
Eagan, was just as confident.
Nearly all the money bet went at the
odds of 2 to 1, with Jeffries favorite. All
the big bets, averaging $500 or more, were
made by Jeffries' admirers, the money
being taken up by small bettors on Cor
bett in $10 and $20 bets. John Brink, a
well known sporting man of Los Angeles,
came into Corbett's poolrooms about 8
o'clock last evening, trying to get a 5500
bet on Jeffries. He had to wait fully half
an hour before he could get the money on.
Charles Clark, son of Senator Clark,
wa3 a great Jeffries admirer and he com
missioned several men to visit the pool
rooms and get as much money as they
could on the champion. The betting was
not spirited, however, and it Is said that
he was unable to get down more than
12000 on Jeffries In this city.
About 6 o'clock last evening Corbett's
friends began to bet on their Idol and for
a while the betting was 10 to 6, with Cor
bett on the short end. This price did not
remain long, however, and within an hour
the price had receded again to 2 to 1, with
Jeffries favorite.
Corbett's clerks estimated that in all
they handled $50,000 on the event, but
even this is comparatively a small figure
for such a big event.
"Zlck" Abrabms said last evening that
there was practically no betting on the
fight. Very little money changed hands
In his poolrooms.
The reason given for so little betting is
generally conceded to be that the bet
ting public had very little confidence In
Corbett's chances. " 'Jeff* Is a younger
man than 'Jim'; I guess I will keep my
money In my pocket," was the general re
mark heard around the poolrooms.

in Time to See Big
Contest.
Chief of Police Cartwrlght of New York,
on pleasure bent, arrived in this city yes
terday, apparently unobserved by the nu
merous New Yorkers who are at present
visiting San Francisco. Going quietly to
the Palace Hotel he engaged quarters, re

to the Western metropolis with a view of
remaining here at least a week.
' In the evening he met a number of ac

CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., Aug. Itâ The
strike committee to-day issued a reply to
the mine owners* manifesto, which de

mines, and called upon the men to return
to work. The reply characterizes the mine
owners* announcement as a "big bluff."
declares that the miners quit work for a
principle and will not go back until or
dered to do so by their officers, and adds:
Regarding- the offer of protection for mÂ»a
w*ho desire to return to work, no protection wilt
be necessary, because the miners are law-abid*
ing men and no trouble is anticipated.
Everything is quiet In the district and no
Imported thucs are wanted, whose business Is
to create strife where none exists, and. further
more, none will be tolerated.
The proper officials, assisted by law-abiding
citizens, will take care of these sentry should
they appear.

to straighten him out. That we were able to make him last as

rounds didliim a world of good.

Â«t\ draws near interest In the event is
increasing among the leashmen,
many of whom have candidates in
training for the rich event. Â» .
Some of the puppies are being tried In
private, while others are learning the
rudiments of the game in open stakes,
where they meet older coursers. This is
considered the best method of accustom
ing them to the field, as they run' under
the same conditions they will encounter
when they compete for the stake.
The event continues to bear an open
look, no one of the candidates^ , which
have appeared up to the present time
standing out above its fellows.
The meeting of the Interstate Coursing

Colma some days since from St. Louis.
They will be placed in active training at
once and will soon be seen In competition.
George Nethercott, the Sacramento
coursing man, has bought Game Boy from
Joe Shea. W. C. Glasson has bought

Sunday to engage in the proposed try-
out of the rowing men , who wish to
take part in the Astoria regatta, but that
they found nothing doing. The other
crews that wish to be sent to Astoria as
representatives of the Pacific Association
are from the Ariel and South End Row
ing clubs. The representatives of the Ala
roeda Boat Club In the barge races at
Astoria will be E. B. Thorning of the
senior crew, Sidney Pollard of the Inter
mediate four, with George Schroeder and
A. C. Webb of the Junior crew. E. B.
Thorning will take part In all the out
rigged skiff races at Astoria. The Ala
meda men will not use the barge in which
they rowed at the Lake Merrltt regatta,
as that is so light and fast that it would
give them an unfair advantage over their
competitors. They will row In the barge
Ethel. The San Francisco oarsmen will
go on the steamer leaving this city for
Astoria to-morrow. The regatta occu

The Dolphin Boating Club joined the N.

the Eastern regatta under Its colors.
Alee W. Pape, accompanied by his wife,
reached Worcester, Mass., on Wednesday,
August 5, after spending some time with
his brother Eric, the artist and illus
trator. He entered In the thirty-first an
nual regatta of the New York Associa
tion of Amateur Oarsmen held on Lake
Quinsigamond, Worcester, on August 14
and 15. Immediately after reaching
Worcester he went to the lake to look
over the course and was much pleased
with it: Though he did not go out in a
shell, as his own did not arrive' on the
fth. he said that he felt sure of being
able to pull some seconds faster on the
lake than on any water that he ever
rowed on. He appears to be In perfect
physical condition and not at all dis
heartened by his failure at the American
Henley in Philadelphia. He considers
that the climate was against him, as his
stomach had not become accustomed to
the water of that city. Pape is well
aware that he will have to row fast to
beat his competitors in the national
event, but he considers his chances good.
At Philadelphia he was unfamiliar with
the course, but he reached Worcester in
time to go over it several times and make
himself acquainted with it.

THE class . singles tournament com
menced on the; park;. tennis courts
two weeks ago will be completed to-
day. The fourth 'class was^ finished
last Sunday and again resulted in a vic
tory for Melville Long. The finals of the
first class, which were. scheduled for last
Sunday, will be played to-morrow at 2
p. m. The match was called off last Sun
day on account of the weather, but will
positively be played to-morrow.
As all the matches for to-morrow are
the finals or semi-finals, they should prove
close and interesting. The first class
match will be the feature and gives prom
ise of a great struggle. The contestants
will be George Baker of Oakland and
Charles Dunlap of San Francisco. It will
be three sets out of five.
In the second class the best match will
come In the semi-final round, when
George Janes and G. D. Russell meet.
Janes Is one of the park's most promis
ing youngsters, while Russell is . a vet
eran, who has won honors in the East.
He has not played for five years, but is
fast getting back to his old game. Many
pick him to' win the class, despite his lack
of practice. The winner will meet the
winner of the Foley- Ambrose match. ;.""-â¢-
In the third , class there will also be
three matches. Stewart Gayness will
meet J. R. Lewis and Fred Adams will
be .opposed to L. D. Roberts. Gayness
has already Won the cup twice and a vic
tory, to-morrow will give it to him per
manently. He won his matches easily
last Sunday and Is a favorite for the
class honors to-morrow, although he will
have to play his best . to win. .
All the cracks are practicing hard for
the coming coast championship tourna
ments. They will commence on the last
days of this month and be finished on
September, 9. J. D. MacGavin returned
from Nome on Monday and will take up
the game next week. MacGavin has riot
played since May 30 and will have to play
constantly to be In his best form' by the
end of the month.
Grant Smith is giving most of his at
tention to his back-court game, which has
always bedn much weaker than his net
game. Smith Is developing a sure half
speed drive that should win him many
points when he is unable to assume the
net position: .
In doubles It will be up to Smith, and
MacGavin to wrest the cups from the
southern' players. 'As both; have Im
proved very much In the last year a great
deal is expected of them.. ' '-
The southern men, especially Bell, have
also Improved and the games are expected
to prove- more Interesting this year than
last Freeman, the champion, appears to
be In poor form. and unless he picks up
wonderfully In the next two weeks the
chances are there , will be a new coast
champion for the coming year. It Is ex
pected the great struggle for first place
in the tournament will be between Bell,
Smith and MacGavin. .
In the women's events the Buttons will
again carry .off all the honors. Miss
Miriam Edwards will be the strongest lo
cal player, but her chances of beating
the clever Sutton sisters are anything
but good. . . ,
Professor Joseph Dally, who attended
the Southern California tournaments, re
ports that May Sutton is playing a
stronger game than ever.

Iberg still suffers from hard luck in all
the games he pitches. His twirling
throughout the season has been-excep
tionally good, but the team never hits at
all behind him and so far has been ac
cording him support that would loss
panics for any pitcher. If Ham can only
fall heir to a little of the good fortuno
that seems due him he will undoubtedly
climb to the top of the pitching list.
The Hildebrand brothera, Charley Reil
ly's star, battery, seem to be the. bright
est lights In the Pacific National League.
They have won every game in which they
have figured as a battery since they be
dame acclimated, and their work has been
nothing short of marvelous. In fact, with
out the aid of the college tossers Reilly's
team would not be in the headline class
of the Pacific National League.
Charley Irwln, captain of the home
team, states the work of Kelly behind the
bat In the recent trip north has been sat
isfactory. Irwin says Kelly caught good
enough ball to suit him, and If he can
only continue to play the game in that
manner he will be perfectly willing to
have the utility man take Leahy's place
occasionally and allow Tommy to have a
rest, which he surely deserves after his
long spell behind the bat.
This Is a splendid chance for them to
win the honors they have been striving
for so 'long. The Angels are still about
seven games to the good, but this is not
such a big lead considering the season is
not on the wane by a great deal yet. If
San Francisco can give the cripples a de
cisive beating this week and then repeat
the trick with Portland and Seattle in the
coming two series Jim Morley will have
ample reason to worry; about his Angels
and the pennant.
Mike Fisher also should do something
now that he Is on the home field after an
absence that has been both tedious and
disastrous for him and the entire team.
Fisher's slump has been one of the most
notable In the annals of the league. In
fact, the team has been losing so steadily
that all its members, and especially the
pitchers, have become downcast and dis
heartened and show It In their work.

The game was interesting for the very
fact that there was plenty of hitting and
a lot of fast work on the part of the
outfielders, especially O'Hara : and Mur
dock. Lee pitched good . ball after I the
third inning had passed aÂ°nd after . that
he held uncle's bunch in check. . .
Every man on the Oakland team hit the
ball safely once or oftener, with the ex
ception of Buck Francks. Messerly lined
out the only long hits of the game, a pair
of doubles, and both went to left field.
Murdock and Schwartz each made' three
hits and Schwartz scored as many runs.
Dr. Moskiman was put off the grounds
by Umpire McDonald in the fourth round
for talking from the bench. The score:

But the onward march of the Cripples
was not to be stopped. In their half of
the same spasm they again opened fire
on Hodson's delivery and this time they
soused the ball around the lot till two
more runs resulted. San FrancJsco made
one more grand effort In the fourth
round and succeeded In landins .twice,
but after that thej' never got into the
going for an instant.

THE crack of the merry basehit be
gan to sound just as the game
yesterday "between the Cripples and
the ho,me 4 team was well under
way. It continued to act as music to the
ears of the Cripples and as a death march
to uncle's men till the game had run
Its course and all was at an end for the
day. The Cripples had gotten away with
one of the easiest victories of the year
and the score was 7 to 4.
Hodson managed to get through the
first inning without allowing any of his
opporients to squeeze over the plate, but
in the second they began to get ex
tremely familiar with the little man's de
liberate offerings, frhey opened up on
him without the slightest warning and
the fusillade did not stop till three runs
arrived.
But the members of. the home team
seemed determined and at once set about
to do a few stunts with the club them
selves. They got busy enough for a
while and two hits, coupled with a base
on balls and a pair of errors by Smith
and Lohman, put two over the plate
and awakened interest and hope in the
hearts of the local fans.

The transferring of the land. by Mor
riEou to the Suburban Company Is believed
to be to strengthen It to fight the Bay
Cities Company. It is said the Suburban
Company has a strip of land right across
the site of Wheeler's proposed reservoir
and with the acquisition of this 12.000
acres of watershed will attempt to hold
the reservoir site for its own use. This
would cripple the Hay Cities Company.
The Cay Cities Company is now work
ing- on a tunnel near Smiths Creek in the
Mount Hamilton range by which it is
planned to conduct the waters of the sec
tion into the reservoir to be built at
Coyote.
SAN* JOSE, Aug. 14.â More than 12,000
a,cres of land In the Coyote watershed,
near Coyote station, were transferred to
day to the Suburban Company by A, F.
Morrison of San Francisco. A couple of
years ago this land was bought up by
George T. Dunlap of Gilroy and deeded
10 Morrison. The deeds filed by Morrison
to-day bear the dates of 1901 and 1902,
about the time Dunlap transferred the
land to him. It is believed the Subur
ban Company is a suborganizatlon of the
Hprir.g Valley Water Company of San
Francisco. The land adjoins the property
acquired by Colonel E. G. Wheeler for
the Bay Cities Water Company.
The transfer to-day Is believed to be
the preliminary to a big fight over the
Coyote watershed between the Spring
Valley Water Company and the Bay
Cities Water Company. The, Bay Cities
Water Company betran a suit here last
we<^k apalnst the Suburban Company and
the San Jose Water Company to condemn
Mxty acres of land near Coyote station
for a reservoir site. The San Jose Water
Company, in answering the complaint, de
c-lares the legal document is not clear
and that it docs not show the Bay Cities
Company -has tho water or the money to
bui'.d the reservoir.

Special Dispatch to The Call
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 14.âBlood
shed resulted from a tribal fight which
occurred last Saturday, fifty, miles north
west of Skagway, between the. Klukwan
and Chilkat Indians. The Indians went
on the warpath nearly a fortnight ago
because of a dispute over the ownership
of valley land, but not until last Saturday,
did they come to blows. The Klukwans
also believed that the Chilkats had be
witched the Klukwan chief so that he
Â¦was willing to give . them the . land.
United States Marshal Tompklns j went
out from Skagway on Monday to round
up the murderous Indians..
On. Saturday morning a lone Chilkat
visited the village of, the Klukwans. He
went gunning, with the result that one of
the opposing ' braves " was Ial3 ' low, and
this raised the ire of his tribesmen. The
Klukwans immediately started out for re
venge and fell on the ' Chilkats' camp on
Saturday evening. Two of the Chllkata
were killed,; and according 'to' the news

OAKLAND. Aug. 14.â William D.
English died at the East Bay San
itarium here at 4:11 a. m. to-day.
He never revived fully from a re-
cent operation for appendicitis,
and there was little hope of his recovery
after his failure to rally from the shock.
Mr. English was surrounded by his
family at the time of death, his two
brothers, John and Warren B. English,
and his wife and all of his children ex
cept Lieutenant Samuel B. English, who
is on duty with his regiment in Missouri.
The children present were: William D.
Jr., Monroe, Christine, Clara, Gladys and
Lloyd.
William D. English was born in the
lower Shenandoah Valley near Charles
ton, Jefferson County, Va. (now in West
Virginia), February 29. 1842. As a young
man he was a hardware clerk, but his
desire to make a. fortune in a new coun
try led him to California at an early age.
He was in this State during the Civil
War. He was a- vigorous thinker and
an active political manager . even j as a
young man, and early in his California
career he plunged into politics and made
himself a power in his party. He con
tributed largely to the success of the
Democrats in the early days of California.
Mr. English was a Democrat by hered
ity', took great interest in public affairs
and had a natural bent for politics. He
lirst became prominent as a State leader
in the Stockton convention of 1S84, when
he was made chairman of the State Cen
tral Committee,' td which position he was
re-elected in 1&86.' For his efficient ser
vices in these campaigns he was. proposed
by. his friends for the gubernatorial nom
ination before the San Jose convention of
1S90, but was beaten by Mayor E. B.
COURT SUSTAINS
THE FORAKER ACT
Porto Rico Merchandise
Is Subject to
Dutv
NEW. YORK,. Aug. 14.â Judge Ray in
the United States Circuit Court to-day
banded down an Opinion - sustaining the
constitutionality Â¦Â¦*â¢ of the ' Foraker act,
which provides a new revenue tax on
merchandise brought into the United
States from Porto Rico after the island
ceased to be . a foreign country. To-day's
decision sustained a demurrer interposed
by the United States in an action com
menced against it by the sugar, importing
firm of Lascelles & Co. of New York.
The firm Imported a cargo of sugar
from Porto Rico on June 12, 1S99, which
was placed on its arrival in a bonded
warehouse. The entry was . liquidated on
November 14," 1899, under 'the existing
Dingley* tariff act On "June 6 duties were
reassessed, under, the Foraker act. The
firm protested against the imposition of
any and all duties.
Finally, under protest, $2500 duty was
paid and suit for its recovery instituted.
The Government demurred, claiming that

SALT LAKE, Aug. 14.â A special to the
Tribune from Lander, Wyo., says that
as the result of the attempt of Jim Dol
lard to "shoot up the town" last night
Frank Bryant and Ross Springer, the lat
ter a printer, are dead and Dollard Is in
jail. Threats of lynching are being made,
but the authorities do not expect any se
rious trouble. Dollard ran out of car
tridges in killing Bryant and used a
heavy board to kill Springer, crushing tho
latter's skull.
There is no early hope for the man who
boasts of his failures.

English, late ' member of ' Congress - from
the Third' District, now" residing near
Santa Rosa, in Sonoma County.
Mr. English, though active In politics,
was never a candidate for an elective of
fice before the people. He, however, held
several positions, both of honor and emol
ument, by appointment. '
He was a man of fine business capacity
and was generally successful In his j en
terprises, though too free-handed to ac
cumulate a great fortune. He was high
minded, affable and courteous to high and
low. alike, and held the deserved esteem
of all who came in contact with him in
any way.
Governor Budd shortly before he went
out of office caused him to be appointed
secretary of - the . Harbor Commission,
which office, he continued to hold until
April last, when he resigned to become
vice president and manager of the Contra
Costa -Water Company.
In 1ES7 he was appointed by Governor
Bartlett as a member of the State Board
of Harbor Commissioners and served un

his defeat, however, but did good work
for his party in the campaign which fol

was also his means. In part recognition
of his ability and efficient work, in 1892
he was appointed Surveyor of the Port by

The new road is to be known as the
Fort Bragg and Southeastern Railroad
Company. It became^ known this after
noon that W. J. Dingee, a capitalist of
Oakland, has granted to the road a right
of way over his lands In this county. This
right of way extends for fifty feet o:x
either side of the tract, and the deed gives
the company whatever additional land is
required for sidings, ditches, excavations
and embankments. The company is al
lowed the privilege of entering the prem
ises to survey a. route and Locate switches,
etc., the only requirement mentioned be
ing the completion of the road to tide
water at San Francisco Bay within six
months from the date of tho deed, JunÂ«
3, 1903. It i3 stipulated that connection
with a railroad entering the bay city will
be considered the building of the* road to
the desired point. It Is not Improbable
that the new road will be a subsidiary
line to connect with the CaJflornia

PROMINENT FORESTERS WHO WILL REPRESENT CALIFORNIA
AT THE SESSION OF THE SUPREME COURT 'OF THE ORDER
WHICH CONVENES IN PROVIDENCE. R. I., THIS MONTH.
A few years ago while visiting San
Francisco James Campbell was kid
naped by two men and held "a prisoner
in a house for some days in the hope that
he could be induced to turn over a large
check for his release. The old millionaire
refused to ransom himself and was finally
found by the police. His kidnapers were
afterward captured by the police and sent
to prison.
The estate consists ot\ holdings in the
shape of improved plantations in the
Hawaiian Islands and also property in
Honolulu.
The notice which appoints H. L. Gear
the guardian ad lltem of Muriel and
Mary Campbell shows that George A.
Davis * has been appointed guardian of
the estates of the children by the District
Court of Hawaii. Suit must be . com
menced before the 20th of this month, as
the time to appeal from the decree of
distribution expires on that day.
While the attack on the trust is brought
in the name of the minor heirs, it is said
that Mrs. Campbell-Parker and the other
two daughters, who have reached their
majority, sanction the move. Mrs. Par
ker, is said to have stated some time
ago that as the property belongs to her
daughters she Is desirous of them getting
it and enjoying It. As she is one of the
trustees of the trust there will probably
be no opposition to the' dividing of this
rich estate among the heirs. It is said
recent decisions dissolving trusts created
under similar conditions make certain
that. the safeguards James Campbell in
tended to throw around his vapt estate
that his children should not want will not
stand.
It will be set forth that the trust is
illegal, in that it Is an attempt to estab
lish a perpetuity, in that the trust is ex
tended twenty years beyond the lives of
the heirs or their grandchildren, and ex
tends beyond the lives of the' beneficiar
ies. . j. , |
Campbell aV short time before his death
purchased ' and ' rebuilt ; the Hotel Â¦;-. St.-
James in'this-cityV and it is because of
having- this estate in California that ! the
contest over the trust will be waged here.
Miss Abble Campbell, a few days aftt-r
her mother married Samuel Parker, be
came the bride of Prince David of Hawaii.
A decree of the court was secured order
ing the sale of the St. James Hotel prop
erty, and Prince David's wife purchased
it. The sum of $182,572 came into the es
tate, and on February 20, 1903, Judge
Hyiand of this county made an order dis
tributing the money to the trustees. These
trustees arc Mrs. Abigail Campbell-Par
ker, Joseph O. Carter and Cecil Brown of
Honolulu. It Js from this order of dis
tribution that an appeal is to be taken
to abolish the trust.
When James Campbell died he left an
estate valued at about $4,000,000, but since
his death it has nearly doubled in value;
One-third of the estate was bequeathed
to his widow, Mrs. Abigail Campbell, who
afterward married Samuel Parker, the
well known planter and politician of Hon
olulu. ; The other twb-thlrdB waa created
intoa trust for the benent of the four
children, Misses Abbie, Alice, Muriel and
Mary ; Campbell. The trust" provides that
the property shall be placed in the hands
Of three trustees, and the proceeds shall
be divided among the benericiaries. The
principal, it is further provided, | shalit be
held during the life of the . beneficiaries
and, their heirs', and may also be extended
twenty years 'after the death of the last
heir of the four children. -""""" '
SAN JOSE, Aug. 14-â The trust created
in' -the estate of James Campbell, ; the
Honolulu ; millionaire who died April 21,
1900, is . to be attacked in the Superior
Court of this county. The first steps
looking to the contest were taken to-day
when Judge S. F. Leib made an order
appointing H. L. Gear, a San Francisco
attorney, guardian ad lltem of Muriel and
Mary Campbell, minor doughters of the
deceased. â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Such a vast saving will appeal to own
ers of mining property containing rebel
lious ore and will be an Incentive for
them to develop their properties. The
lower part of the county is rich In base
metal prospects, the only obstacle in the
way of development In the past being
lack of transportation. â¢ "^
NEVADA, Augr. 1*.â A crew of survey
ors is now working between here and
Lincoln, surveying for a new broad gauge
railroad. It is expected that Inside- ot
three weeks the survey will be com
pleted. C L. "Wilson, the prompter of the
new road, states he nas no connection
whatever with the Western Pacific or the
Southern Pacinc.
Wilson states that it Is to bÂ« an in
dependent line backed by a company
of Chicago capitalists. He is one of th*
best known engineers on the coast, hav
ing offices in the Nevada block. San Fran
cisco. Wilson's father built the first rail
road In California, the line from Sacra
mento to Folaom, which was later con
tinued through Lincoln to the Yuba River.
The name of the new corporation is the
Lincoln San Francisco and Eastern Rail
way Company. The object of building is
to afford cheaper transportation between
San Francisco. Grass Valley, Nevada
City and intermediate points.
The railroad will connect with a dally
line of steamboats at Vexnon Landing on
the Sacramento River for San Francisco.
The road will run from Vernon to Ntc
olaus. in Sutter County, to Lincoln, in
Placer County, and from there to Sponee
ville. in Nevada County, then to Rough
and Ready, to Grass Valley and Nevidii
City.
While the road expects to handle pas
sengers and all kinds of freight at great
ly reduced rates, the main object of tho
line is to furnish cheap transportation on
ores of all kinds to a !arge smelter, whlcn
is to be erected between Lincoln and Bear
River. The smelter will have 1000 tor.3
per day capacity for handling copper and
gold ore too base to be milled to advan
tage. This will be a custom smelter, al
though the company intends to purchase
several copper mines in the vicinity of
Lincoln and Spencevllle and work them
on its own account.
The smelter will look to Grass Valley
and Nevada City for concentrates and
sulphurets. and any ore too base to be
milled to advantage will be worked in con
nection with the copper ores found arouiul
Rough and Ready. Spenceville and Lin
coln. The promoters expect to start
grading between Lincoln and Vernon this
fall and also between Lincoln and Bear
River. The road will be completed within
one year.. The company expects to haul
ore to the smelter for J2 a ton and treat
it for $6 more, thus making a total of $S.
The present cost is approximately $Z0 a
ton, when ore Is shipped below for treat
ment.

Mayor Represents Musicians.
Mayor Schmitz and the committee com

Keogh, appointed by the Musicians* Mu
tual Protective Union, will call upon the
executive committee of the Grand Army
of the Republic this afternoon and try
and bring about a settlement of the
strike declared by the local musicians.
The Mayor is of the opinion that if the
executive committee engaged bands to
play in the parade at a less rate than
is charged by civilian musicians they
have erred. He claims that the Secretary
of War has time and again issued orders
that army bands must not compete with
bands in the community.
General Stone, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee of the encampment,
stated yesterday that the musicians had
asked $9 for each man and $13 for all
leaders who would, take part in the pa
rades and entertainments. The Musicians'
Union had been requested some time ago
to modify its tariff of rates, as the ex
ecutive committee did not have funds
enough to pay the rates asked by the
union musicians. The union, after con
sidering the request of the executive com
mittee, decided not to reduce its rates.

GOVERNOR BULKELEY RETIRES.
Connecticut's Executive Not to Run
' for Commander in Chief.
A telegram received here last evening
stated that tho delegates from Connecti
cut, numbering 144, who are due in this
city early Sunday morning, have aban
doned the . idea of supporting Governor
Morgan C. Bulkeley, . their department
commander, for the position of command
er in chief of the Grand Army of the R"e
public. When the representatives of the
Nutmeg State started out on their pres
ent pilgrimage to the far West Governor
Bulkeley was their only choice "for the
high position in the army of veterans,
but en route to the coast he formally an
nounced that he was not a candidate for
the place. It is understood that the dele
gates will support the candidacy of Gen
eral Black.
i Mrs. Bulkeley, who accompanies her
husband on the trip, is a California n, her
father having been one of the pioneers
and at one time a member of the Califor
nia Boundary Commission. The party in
cludes a number of distinguished mem
bers of the Grand Army, one of the most
notable being N. Burton Rogers, a mem
ber of the noted "Danbury firm of cutlers.
He broke into the war as a drummer boy
during the last years of the rebellion, and
for a number of years he was known as
the youngest department commander seen
at the encampments held in the New
England States. Other members of the
party arc former Department Command
ers S. B. Horn of Winsted, J. K. Bucklyn
of Mystic and Henry E. Talnter of Hart
ford.

Colorado Boom Is Started by Advance
â¢ Guard of Veteran Soldiers.
Several delegates from Colorado who
arrived yesterdayin advance of the main
body of o!d soldiers from that State have
already started a boom for Denver, which
will try to 3ecure the next encampment.
While if is generally acknowledged that
there is little likelihood of the next en
campment being held in the West owing
to the long distance that the majority of
the veterans would have to travel, the
people of the Colorado metropolis have
decided to, make a try for it. In discuss
ing the matter last evening one of the del
egates said:
The Chamber of Commerce of Denver met
last Monday evening and there were present
Governor Peabody and other representative
men of the State, who decided that Colorado
Bhould issue a formal invitation to the mem
bers of the Grand. Army of the Republic "to
hold an encampment in Denver next year. As
surances were received from various commer
cial bodies of the State of support to the
movement and the delegation now on the way
from Denver Is fully prepared to carry out the
plan for securing recognition if it is possible.
MORE FUNDS -ARE NEEDED.

ESCORT TO GENERAL BLACK.
"This reform, by removing the ancient
causes of social dissension, will, I heart
ily trust, conduce to the common benefit
of all my Irish subjects."
Reference is made in the speech to the
Eeneral anxiety regarding the situation
in the European provinces of Turkey; to
the great progress made in the work of
resettlement and pacification in South
Africa, and the improvement in the con
ditions of agriculture and finance in India.
After the reading of the King's Epeech
Parliament was prorogued until Novem
ber 2.
Referring to the Irish land bill, the
speech says It offers Inducements to the
landowners to continue their residence
among their countrymen and provides fa
cilities for impro^ng the conditions of life
5n the poorer districts of the West. It
adds:
The most icteresting portion of the
speech to America deals with Ireland. It
says: Â»
The warm ekpressior.s of cood Â¦srill with
Â¦fth^b I" was Â»very*'bere received greatly
toucSed toa. My visit enabled me to realize
to>w rnufh wan Iv'.r.p attempted to improve
the housing accommodation for the working
population, rtimulale commercial activity, ad
fÂ«nr* t*i* nwehods of sericulture, develop
f^r.'itiicfci education and provide for' the sick
f-.nd ln^rm. Much remains to be dene, but It
â¢ru with feelings of the deepest gratification
that I nr>ll<-*~i Fipns cf increafir.* concord
among all classes in Ireland, presaging, as I
hope, a new era of united efforts lor the gen
eral welfare.
CONCORD IN IRELAND.
Tfto speech was of little general or in
ternational Interest. It alluded to the cor
diality of the King's reception in Por
tugal, Italy and France and to the re
turn visit of President Loubet, "whose
Visit has given rise to a striking exhibi
tion of the feeling of mutual good will
which prevails in. the two countries."
With a f.n&l fling from Winston
Churchill, who seemed doubtful whether
the present Parliament would meet ajaln
and who characterized the Premier's pol
icy of transferring the fiscal discussion
from Parliament to the as that
of a demagogue, the sitting was sus
pended. Subsequently the House was
summoned to the House of Lords to hear
the King's speech, proroguing Parliament,
r*Â»ad.
Dealing with the protests against puz
zling the House on the fiscal contro
versy, the Premier said he thought there
was no necessity for undue hurry In dis
cussing- the matter. There was no pend
ing fiscal question before Parliament, nor
would there be one during the currency of
the present Parliament.
THE TURKISH QUESTION.
Regarding the complaints that the Gov
ernment was showing a lack of sympathy
with Macedonia, Balfour pointed out that
one of the deep sources of mischief was
the dissensions among the Christians. It
was not the Turk alone â deep as his guilt
undoubtedly wasâ who was responsible
for the miserable conditions. It would be
folly to forget that the Christians com
mitted atrocities on Christians. The Gov
ernment was still of the opinion that the
best policy was to support the Austro-
RusÂ«rian endeavors to improve the ad
ministration.
In the House of Commons several ques
tions were askeel relating to matters of
international interest. , Premier Balfour,
in a general reply, said there had bÂ«en
an unexpected delay in the Venezuelan
question, which, however, was not due
to Great Britain or Germany, who had
taken parallel action, but to the fact that
France and Spain objected to the use of
the English language by the tribunal.
The question had been left to the tribunal
Itself to decide. He believed that the
court, whose members the Czar had been
requested to nominate, would meet on the
date originally fixed.
LONDON, Aug. It-There has probably
never been a prorogation of Parliament
which for the future of the Government
was so uncertain as is the case of this
occasion. Many believe there will be a
dissolution in the autumn, though this
information does not support this belief.
Balfour'B cpeech at Sheffield at^ the end
of September is awaited with the keenest
interest, as it will, contain a pronounce
ment of policy, which will possibly force
either the Duke of Devonshire â a pro
nounced free traderâ or Colonial Secre
tary Chamberlain, to resign. The mem
bers of Parliament will curtail their holi
daysâthe Free Food Leagners, in order
to open the fiscal campaign as speedily as
possible, and the followers of Chamber
lain to repel the attack.
Both houses of JParliament assembled
to-day to wind up the business of the ses
sion.

Delegates Speeding From Massachu

The first special train carrying delegates
and their friends from Massachusetts will
arrive here to-mprrow morning. The train
consists of eleven coaches and a baggage
car and Is one of the largest specials en
route to the city, the party numbering in
all 300 persons, who during their stay
here will make their headquarters at the
Palace Hotel. The representatives of the
Woman's Relief Corps, who make up a
large portion of the party, are headed by
Mrs. Clara H. B. Evans of North Adams,
who is department president. Following

Boston last Wednesday morning:
DUE TO ARRIVE TO-MORROW.

States, and every incoming train brings
prominent men from all parts of the coun
try.

ican War Veterans during the encamp

rade will be furnished by Camp Richter
Mo. 127, Spanish-American War Veterans.
A drill, corps has been organized which
will be uniformed in khaki, each mem
ber of which is a well drilled ex-soldier.
The corps will be armed with Springflelds
for this occasion and is expected to make
a fine military display.
The re'mainder of the camp, the memr
bership of which is close to 500, will as
sist in dragging a prize piece of Spanish
light artillery which was captured by the
First California Volunteers at Dumagati,
a town on Negros Island, In the Philip

ception of the G. A. R. by tlje Veterans

Judging from the numbers of veterans
of the Spanish war who are pouring into
the city and the Interest exhibited in
their coming national encampment, ono
of the principal features of the coming

all organizations of the late war. This
much desired amalgamation has been in
cessantly worked for during the papt
three years and the end Is in sight. North,
South, East and West have -sent repre
sentatives, and the Spanish-American
War Veterans of San Francisco have
made extensive preparations to receive
and entertain them in regulation soldier
style.
The parade of Tuesday, August 18, will
be a revelation to many, as every man
in San Francisco who has an honor
able discharge from the army or navy
will once more fall in line and step to
the sound of bugle and drum, i
. The warriors who fought more than
thirty years ago' to preserve the Union
look with kindly eyes upon the youthful
heroes who went to the front in 1S9S to
defend the honor of the 'stars and stripes
and avenge the death of the gallant sall
6r,s who perished In the sinking of the

Mrs. Smith cut off her husband's al

letters threatening to kill himself, but
no attention was paid to the threats. She
is now in Atlantic City.
MILWAUKEE. Aug. 14.â Captain H. E.
Smith, the retired army officer who com
mitted suicide in Los Angeles, was the
husband of Mrs. Blanche Hubbell Smith
of Houghton. Mich., But who had re
cently claimed Detroit as her home. Sho
intended to get a divorce in the latter
city in a few days and then come to
Milwaukee to reside.
Mrs. Smith three years ago was mar
ried to Captain Smith, who retired from
the army soon after on account of some
trouble, it is said. ' She had just inher
ited about half a million dollars by the
death of her father and mother and after
traveling about the country for a time
went to NewÂ»York. Smith was taken ill
and auarreled with his wife. She paid
for his traveling expenses about the coun
try, and it is said had spent over $100,000
on him. Recently she took a flier In
Wall street stocks, and last week caused
the arrest of her brother in New York
on a charge of fleecing her out of $53,000.
Joseph Cowan, her broker, denied the
charge, but made a settlement with her.

embezzlement of $45,000 of the funds of
the Commercial Banking Company for

about the failure ef the Merchants' Bank

the failure was due to a run on the bank
resulting from the closing of the Com

heavy, more interruption to traffic being re

apart from this, however, though no >ioubt af

BIG BATTLESHIP
STILL SETTLING
There is a melancholy sadness to all thought
ful people in the passing of the Grand Array
of the Republic. Twenty years from now the
youngest survivor of the War of the Rebellion
will be 76 yeÂ£rs of age, and but comparatively
few of -the. millions, or men who answered the
call of their country in the early '60s will be
living."- Those competent to compile mortuary
statistics fix the year 1005 as the year of the
beginning of the great decline of the veterans
by death. .. ., . . . ' â¢ â¢
The average ace of the survivors of the war
for the suppression of the reoelllon Is about
85 years. The number of deaths for the past
twelve months will be between 40,000 and 5O.
000. This, will Increase yearly with the- added
Infirmities of Increasing 1 years. The large

AN OLD SAYING,
Showing How Cause and Effect Ars
Never Far Removed.
It- is an old saying, "Where there's
honey there's beea"â not Ies3 true is one
which science has coined more recently,
! "Where there's Dandruff there's germs"â
and to push the Inference still further
we may truly say, "Where there's Dan-
druff cured Newbro's Herpicide has been
at work."
The reason of Herpicide'a isolation aa a gen-
uine cure for Dandruff lies In the fact that It
attacks and destroys tit* root of the whole
trouble â a parsitlc germ which feeds upon the
material which nourishes the hair follicle.
Other so-called remedies are not directed,
at thic true cause of the disease.

Reports from India indicate. beyond power of con

In some of the more strenuous incidents of legal
procedure in the United States our European critics â¢Â¦
have censured us somewhat severely because liti
gants, in an outburst of American frankness, would
occasionally shoot one another to death. The Hum

absurdity of which even French justice should be
ashamed.
MR. BRYAN was at his vituperative best at the
" Urbana conference, when he told the Buck
Â¦ eye Democrats that; their party played a con r
fidence game upon the country by giving it a bunko
steerer for President. Without stopping to consider
such a characterization of a President of the United
States the country will gravely consider the preten
sions of a party that is declared by its foremost leader
to be capable of such an offense. It is asking for a
renewal of confidence after its leader declares it to be
a confidence operator. The fact that Bryan's con
fession was loudly cheered, the demonstration rising
to what the reporters call "an ovation," is significant.
Were'his hearers exulting over their, success in im
position and expressing the wish to do it again?
The mutual confessions being made by prominent
Democrats, put together and studied, make that party
out to be the most remarkable organization that ever
attempted to control the destinies of any nation. No
party is immaculate, but the Democracy is put in a
position from which it can clear itself only by Mr.
Cleveland turning his salary, into the conscience fund
of the treasury and by Mr. Bryav advising his coun
trymen not to tryst it again. v Â¦
THE POOR OLD PARTY.
A saloon-keeper of San Francisco has gone into
insolvency. This is one of the signs of the times that
bodes well for the city. If a few more saloon-keepers
would follow his example and his case might be
taken as a straw that tells the direction of the wind
the people of the city would have genuine cause for
congratulation. ...â¢â¢Â¦â¢ * . . .
DISPATCHES from Sofia are to the effect' that
the Macedonian Committee^ is sorely disap
pointed over the attitude of the American
press toward their efforts at overthrowing the Turk
ish Government in Macedonia. A certain Christo
Tartarcheff, who is described as "one of the presidents
of the Central International Macedonian Committee,"
is reported to have declared a conviction that the
American press has been subsidized by Turkish gold
and hired to misrepresent and, distort the actions of
the patriots.
The words of the complaining leader have been
deemed worthy, of transmission by telegraph all the
way from Sofia to this city, and.it is added that after
charging that American newspapers have been bought
by Turkish gold Tartarcheff went on to say: "There
seems to be no other explanation of the tone of their
articles. They are not only unsympathetic toward
the movement, but decidedly inimical to it. It is im
possible that such an attitude could arise from igno
rance of the true state of affairs in a country so.in
telligent as America, and it is also difficult to believe
that the^impression created by the Miss Stone affair
could have so prejudiced the American press."
That statement is sufficient to prove that when
Tartarcheff undertook the work of a member of a
campaign committee he struck his talent. Few in
stances can be cited even in American campaigns of
a bolder flight of roorback eloquence andsapiency
than that of charging the Sultan" with the guilt of
bribing a newspaper. The Sultan has been guilty of
many things, but he has no inclination to spend
money on bribery and no money to spend that way
even if he had the desire. Furthermore his method
of regulating the press has been quite different from
that of wasting mony on it. He has generally' found
a bowstring sufficient, or a scimeter in the hands of
a Bashi Bazouk. .
The most excellent point of the statement of Tar
tarcheff is the suave and gentle expression of a con
viction that it is difficult to believe that the abduc
tion of Miss Stone would have prejudiced the Ameri
can press. Evidently the patriot Macedonian deems
the abduction of a woman to be a matter of no
moment in this country. It probably has never oc
curred to him that had the American people been able
to get their hands on any of the gang engaged in
the abduction they would have lynched the ring
leaders quicker than a crowd of Wyoming cowboys
would string up a cattle thief. , '
American sympathy with the Macedonian people
would be prompt were it not for the revelations made
concerning the methods of the so-called Macedonian
Committee. That band of agitators has been engaged

jr-*\ EN'TRAL and South America are divided
I into sixteen nations, separate states, between
many of which there is no natural frontier.
V/xth the exception of Brazil they were all original
colonies of Spain. The Spanish is the legal and com
mon language and they are all under the domination
of the characteristics of the Spanish people. Of all
these states only Mexico. Brazil, Argentina and Chile
have any semblance of civilized government and pub
lic stability. The others have grown steadily worse
since they threw off the Spanish yoke. They steadily
resist federation and remain politically isolated from
each other.
A glance at the physical and political geography of
the country is very instructive and very suggestive.
The smallest and most disorderly as well as physi
cally the richest of these pestiferous states lie between
Mexico and Brazil. The Herald, published in the
City of Mexico, responsive to the new life infused into
that republic by Diaz and feeling the impulse of great
ideals, has pioneered the way to a solution of the
Latin-American problem by proposing that Chile,
Argentina and Brazil shall absorb Bolivia, Paraguay
and Uruguay. The Herald adds that the small states
between Mexico and Venezuela are the odium of the
hemisphere; that they lag a century behind, rent by
factions and weakened by their internal feuds, and
therefore they should be happy in absorption by Mex
ico, which should become one nation, ruling from
the Rio Grande to Panama.
The civilized world seconds the motion. The day
of such absorption would be little less significant to
the destinies of man than the day of our own inde
pendence. The political union of people speaking
the same language and living under the same com
mon law, but divided into insignificant political
states, is the modern destiny of peoples. What the
petty and wretched states of Central America do for
themselves in staying apart. was done for the German
states by their enemy, France, and for Italy by her
Austrian enemy. The genius of Bismarck and not
the power of the Hohenzollerns effected the unifica
tion of Germany, and now a great and glorious em
pire spreads where petty states did no more than
furnish the satire for Offenbach's opera bouffe. The
expulsion of Austria from Italy unified that distracted
land, which Bonaparte had helped to carve into
giblets.
With Greater Mexico extended to Panama the ab
sorption of Venezuela would follow, and the isthmus
and South America would present to the world the
preat states, powers among the powers, of Mexico,
Brazil, Argentina and Chile, for Peru could not long
resist the unifying tendency and would fall to Chile.
This process would meet with encouragement and
not obstruction from the United States. Our policy
is different from that of England on the continent of
Europe. It was long a primary maxim of British
statesmanship to prevent any nation holding the bal
ance of power on the Continent This was the cause
of her Napoleonic wars, undertaken not merely to
prevent the control of the balance of power by
France, but to avert the greater danger of her Conti
nental empire. But when thi3 was accomplished by
Lcipsic and Waterloo England had no interest in the
confederation of the small German states nor the uni
fication of Italy. Our policy, is entirely different
Our interests would be served by the erection of four
gre2t nations between the Rio Grande and the straits
cf Magellan. So vital is this to our interests that if,
as is likely, we are compelled to resort to force in
vindication of the rights of our nationals, grossly in
vaded as they constantly are by those small piratical
'states, we would be justified in handing the offender
over, bound and gagged, to the keeping of Mexico.
If the Mexican conquistadors move southward
tinder the banner cf Cortez our people will watch
Iheir progress with friendly solicitude and hail their
rpnquests with applause.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Naturally enough Japan watches these movements
of troops and changes of administrative systems with
close attention. Russian authorities are well aware
of the jealousy of Japan, and while doing all in their
power to allay it by promises are also preparing for
war at any moment.
A St. Petersburg estimate of the situation is thus
given: "If Japan makes this a pretext for war Russia
cannot prevent her; but Russia is prepared. Under
the most favorable circumstances the force which
Japan will be able to put into the field cannot exceed
400,000 men. But the quality of her army compen
sates in a considerable degree for the smallness of the
number. The Japanese fleet, indeed, is far superior to
the Russian, but, none the less, Japan will have to
reckon with the fact that she cannot withdrawal her
soldiers from Japan; a certain number must needs
remain to protect her seaboard. In order to throw
upon the Asiatic continent the number of troops
required by a war with Russia and to place them in
Korea Japan would require under the most favorable
circumstances from four to six weeks. Russia has at
present about 110,000 men on the western side of
Lake Baikal and foo,ooo more whom. she could with
draw from European Russia and throw into Western
Siberia in the space of a month." . J
From the start the Manchurian problem has been
an interesting illustration of the advantage which a
man with a definite purpose has over a dozen rivals
who' have no definite object in view. Russia has
confronted the powers on the Manchurian question
with a clear idea of what sh*e wishes and of the
method^ by which she expects to attain it. On the
other hand the powers have had no clearness of vis
ion. Thus Russia has won every move in the game.
She has completed her railways, she has fortified her
posts and strengthened her garrisons. She is now
about ready to meet any foe that comes and her posi
tion will be made stronger wit'.i every succeeding
RUSSIA while renewing her promises to-evac
uate Manchuria has taken further steps toward
strengthening her hold in that part of Asia.
She has put an end to the system of governing the
region from St. Petersburg through a council of
three officials and has vested supreme command in
a Viceroy, thus centralizing the government and
placing the entire Russian force in Northeastern Asia
under the control of a single will.
The official announcement of the creation of the
viceroyalty was accompanied by a statement that
the new order of things will not affect the Manchu
rian situation. On the same day, however, there
came a report from Moscow to the effect that Russia
is pressing the dispatch of additional troops to the
Far East. The report goes on to say: "Ten troop
trains a day are passing through the trans-Baikal ter
ritory and it is believed that 100,000 men will be
shortly collected there and will be held in readiness
to proceed over the Manchurian Railway to the
coast."

In ! memory of the late Dr. Matthe-ff
Gardner and out of the high respect they
bear him, the San Francisco County Med
ical Society passed resolutions of regret
at his untimely end. At a meeting held
Tuesday a committee, headed by Dr. "VV.
B. Coffee, presented a resolution which
was unanimously adopted and spread
upon the minutes of the society, com
posed of 400 regular physicians and sur
geons of the county. The profound re
gard and confidence the society held for
the late Southern Pacific physician are
expressed in the following words:
With bowed heads and sad hearts we de
plore bis sudden and untimely demise.
Though the Inception of his professional ca
reer was as an obscure and comparatively un
known rural physician. hÂ« soon rose to emin
ence and distinction, and even before he bad

Nature seemed to have endowed Dr. Gardner
with all these 'qualities.
When we see a person ambitious, indus
trious, able, frank, nnn, self-reliant and con
fident we cannot refrain from admiring him;
but there was one phase of Dr. Gardner's
character that particularly commends him to
the warmest esteem.' and that was his In
dulgent consideration for and Kindly forbear
ance with and toward young members ot his
profession. When meeting an older man who
has gained professional character and distinc
tion the youthful medico Is perforce timid
and awed, and frequently loses that nerve >o
necessary to success, but with Dr. Gardner he
was Immediately made to feel at ease.
He had ever present before him his own
early struggles. Experience had taught him
that with youth the world la skeptical of abil
ity, and with those Ideas uppermost in mind
he rever failed to encourage and reassure the
young man. and always consulted and advised
with and deferred to his opinion and Judg
ment with as much alacrity and consideration
as he would with older and presumably more
learned doctors.
Lane argued that the tracks were a
nuisance, and that therefore the city had
the power to remove them. ;
Two years ago Judge Seawell . rendered
a decision on the original complaint ad-"
verse to the railroad company. The pres
ent proceedings are on an amended com
plaint, leave to file which was granted at
that time. â¢.--.. Â¦ < ..
The question of the right of the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company to main
tain Its' tracks on streets in the Mission
district was argued in Judge Seawell's
court yesterday. It came up on an amend
ed complaint for an injunction restraining
the Board of Public "Works from remov
ing the company's tracks on Harrison
street, from Seventeenth to Twenty-sec
ond. Attorney Peter F. Dunne represent
ed the railroad company and George W.
Lane, Assistant City Attorney, represent
ed the Board of Works.
Dunne's argument was that though the
city Had never given the company a fran
chise to lay the tracks in the district,
authority to do so had been- given by im
plication. He said the city had practically
recognised the right of the company, to
maintain' the tracks by its adoption for
the last forty years or more of official
maps on which were delineated the pre
scribed route of the road.
' As regards the next higher grade of In
struction, there are now seven secondary
schools, In different parts of Japan, which
are intended as preparatory for the uni
versities. There are also a number of spe
cial schools in which the direct practical
applications of the subjects studied arn
kept in view. Thua in the Tokio Foreign
Languages School the following eight lan
guages are taught: English, French. Ger
man, Russian, Italian, Spanish. Chinese
and Korean. The Toklo Fine Arts School
provides five courses of study, including
painting, designing, sculpture, architec
ture and Industrial fine arts. The Tokio
Academy of Music furnishes complete in
struction in both Japanese and foreign
music. There are technical schools in
tended to prepare men to take charge of
industrial operations. Thus the agricul
tural school at Supporo is' designed to
train agriculturists for the Island of
Yezo, which is to Japan what Alaska la
to the United States. The Toklo Technical
School trains managers and foremen of
factories, and a slmlllar Institution, al
ready fully equipped, has been started in
Osaka. Even the commercial aspect of
education Is not overlooked; the higher
commercial school In Toklo has fifty-three
Instructors and 666 pupils.
UNIVERSITIES IN JAPAN.
There are in Japan two universities,
namely, the Imperial University of Toklo
and the Imperial University of Kyoto.
The former comprises a university hall
and six colleses of law, medicine, engi
neering, literature, science and agricul
ture. The College of Engineering offers
nine courses, to wit: Civil engineering,
mechanical engineering, electrical engi
neering, naval architecture, technology of
arms, civil architecture, applied chemis
try technology of explosives and mining
and metallurey. The total number of
resident instructors Is 222, and there ara
thirty-five assistant professors now study
ing in foreign countries. The students
number 2SS0, and include eleven foreigners,
one of them a native of the United States.
The University of Kyoto, though founded
much latÂ«r than that of Toklo. includes.
besides the university hall, colleges of
law,' medicine and of science and engi
neering. The College of Science and En
gineering provides courses In mathemat
ics, physics, pure chemistry, chemical
technology, civil, mechanical and elec
trical engineering and mining and metal
lurgy. There are alreadytwenty-five pro
fessors and 1S6 students.
"When we add that there are laboratories
for special purposes and man;- public li
braries, we are in a position to appreciate
the astonishing progress In education
made by Japan within thirty years.
SPECIAL SCHOOLS.
It appears that in Japan, during the
school year Just ended, the percentage of
children of school age receiving the pre
scribed course of elementary instruction
was 90.35 for boys and 71.75 for girls. Tha
total number of elementary schools was
nearly 27/XX). The number of teachers fell
but a little short of 93,000, and the total
number of children In the schools ex
ceeded 4,683,000. The percentage of the
enrolled pupils who attended daily was
84.61 per cent. These are remarkable fls
ures, and It is no less noteworthy that
the training of both male and female
teachers for the elementary schools re
ceives careful attention, and that the ap
pliances and hygienic conditions of the
school buildings are undergoing continual
Improvement.
The extraordinary facilities for elemen
tary, secondary * and university instruc*
tion now offered In Japan will be found
described In the latest annual report pub*
Ushed at Toklo by the minister of educa
tion. The signer of the report. Baron Kl
kucbl Dalroku, not only graduated soma
thirty years ago at the University of
Cambridge, England, but took a high
place In the wranglers' list. After his re
turn to his native country he became pro
fessor of mathematics at tha University
of Toklo, and Is regarded as the highest
Japanese authority In educational affairs.
The facts set forth in his report are
likely to surprise many persons un
familiar with the efforts that have long
been made to extinguish Illiteracy In the
Mikado's empire.
CONSULAR CLERK H. G. MURPHY has
6ent from Frankfort a copy of a letter to the
Zeitung of that city, written by a correspond
ent in Buenos Ayrcs, giving an account of the com
petition Germany has to meet in the markets of
South America. It is not gratifying to learn from
the letter that the Germans count us as an insignifi
cant factor in the situation as it exists and set our
competition aside* as a matter of little moment.
In the course of his letter the writer points out
that there has been a diminution of German trade
in some of the more important South American mar- ?
kets, and then adds: "It may be well to explain the
cause of the . decreased importation from Germany.
It is not due to the United States' competition in
South America, as the United States has had very
little sOccess there except in the Argentine Repub
lic." In another connection, reviewing South Amer
ican trade from 1892 to 1902, he says: "Were it not
for the increased purchasing power of the Argentine
Republic, which has enabled the United States during
the period mentioned to increase its exports to this
country to tfye extent, of $7,000,000, there would
have been not only a relative but an actual decrease in
the total value of exports from the United States to
South k America."
That is the way a German commercial expert sums
up our trade position in South America. He finds
it more interesting to discuss the competition of
Great Britain against Germany, for he finds that
more formidable and therefore more worthy of study.
If we were in any doubt as to the reason why our
competition is not beared by our rivals in South
American markets we would find light thrown upon
the subject by a report of Consul General Patterson
of Calcutta, who after giving statistics showing how
far the United States lags behind other nations in
her exports to India, says: "The only obstacle to the
development of trade between the United States and
India is the want of a rapid direct steamship line so
that goods may be delivered in a reasonable time.
* * * If importers could rely upon a quick deliv
ery of goods I believe the trade would increase three
fold within two years." Trade is governed by the
same laws all over the world, and since it is a lack of
ships that causes our trade to languish in India it is
fair to assume that the lagging in South America is
due to the same cause.
Great Britain has just given us a striking illustra
tion of the high value she sets upon the maintenance
of a British controlled merchant marine. She has
entered into an agreement with the International
Mercantile Marine Company by which it is provided
that the ships of the British companies included in
the combine shall not be transferred to a foreign
registry without the consent of the British Govern
ment, that the vessels shall continue to be officered
by British subjects, carry the same proportion of
British seamen as other British ships of a similar
class, and in addition thereto shall be liable to postal,
naval and military service whenever the Government
requires it.
Furthermore, a3 a means of building up a com
peting line in opposition to the International, the
Government has arranged to grant the Cunard
Steamship Company upward of $13,000,000 to be
devoted to the construction of. two steamers, each
of which will surpass in magnitude any now afloat.
The amount advanced is to be repaid in twenty years
on easy terms, but that does not constitute the whole
of the aid given to the company, for in addition to
the loan there is to be a subsidy which is expected to
yield to the company $80,000 the first year over and
above the interest and installments due on the debt.
That is the way Britain holds her trade. We have
abstained from following the example and we see the
consequences.

METHODS IN THE
MIKADO'S REALM
for years in an effort to bring about an insurrection
among a people who in the main appear to have no
sympathy with the conspirators. In the course of
their a'gitation' the leaders of the committee have
stopped at the commission of no kind of crime. Only
recently- a dispatch from Salonicasaid: "Many of the
alarming outrages which are alleged to have occurred
recently, such as the blowing up of a bank at Adrian
ople and a massacre *at Kilkitch, about twenty-five
miles south of Salonica, turn out to have been merely
parts of the insurgent programme, the carrying out of
which was fixed for the 2d. Their execution was pre
maturely announced. Similarly- the dynamite affairs at
Ekishon, near Monastir, and Bonitza were of quite
minor importance. The bridge at Ekishon was only
an n-foot culvert and was "immediately repaired,
while the damage to the railway storehouse at Bonitza
was confined to the watchman's- hut and a number of
telegraph poles."
Thus it appears the committee instigates crimes
and then charges them to the Turks. When it can
not find men willing to perpetrate serious crimes it
engages them to commit small ones and then pro
ceeds to exaggerate them into 'reports of slaughter
and massacre. Altogether the Macedonian Commit
tee seems to be a bad lot. ,

IF the complete story could be told of the devotion and suffering, of
the privations and heroic sacrifices of all the brave women who nursed
the wounded and the dying on both sides in the bloody conflict be-
tween the North and South it would be one of the crandest. most
sublime narratives ever penned. Even when recorded in brief their ca-
reers speak volumes for the dangers they braved to minister with gentle
hands and lc--ing care. â¢
"Oh, what breaking hearts many mothers aro still carrying for their
boys buried in graves marked 'Unknown/ " says Mrs. Mary J. Bos-
ton, one of these fifty-eight fair veterans of that bloody conflict who have
written two full pages of personal anecdotes of their service in the hos-
pital, the bivouac and the battlefield. She not only consecrated her
life to nursing the wounded throughout the entire war, but gave two
brothers to the cause at Frederic ksburg and a brother-in-law at Gettys-
burg, and the anecdote of which those few lines are the prelude is one
jf the most dramatically thrilling ever penned. These fifty-eight women
saw the awful struggle with their own c;es^ â and it is war â actual warâ,
that each and every one of them has written of from her own peculiar
point of view. Those two pages alone will enthrall you.
To the veterans whose names make up the roll of honor of the
Grand Army of the Republic that stupendous struggle must ever be a
vivid reality, but to those of the younger generation the hope and de-
spair of that fierce conflict must be seen through the eyes of the artist,
the writer and the painter alone. It is a remarkable fact that some of
the best battle scenes ever painted arc those depicting our great Civil
War from beginning to end.
I It is this fact that has enabled The Sunday Call in its special
G. A. R. Edition next Sunday to present its readers with the best pic-
torial panorama of fiercest battles of the war that can be offered by a
modern newspaper. Beginning with General Grant's victory at Fort
Donelson, these pictures carry you through the entire war to its spec-
tacular close with the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox. which
scene alone, replete as it is with historical characters, is one of the most
notable pictures ever reproduced on a modern color press. There is
"The Battle of Shiloh." "Chattnnooga," "The Siege of Vicksburg."
"Sherman's March to the Sea." "The Battle of Gettysburg," "Grant's
Career From West Point to Appomattox," etc.
And in the line of fiction the greatest popularity, has ever been given*
to tales of love and war. Just think what themes ihe Civil War had to
offer. And what sentiment, too. There is "Forty Years After" in the
next Sunday Call, for instance. It is a story of the wavering tide of
battle at Vicksburg. with a thrillingly pathetic denouement in this city
Then there is "A Girl of the South," "Fate's Pence," "A War Vision"
and "Trying Him Out." which latter will bring back the most stirring
memories to any one who knows anything about war.
And in a different way. how many know anything about the
speeches that created that awful slaughter. There are two pages of fervid
eloquence that will simply amaze you who read them now. so many
years after.
And last but not least there is that magnificent Supplement tender
sentiment crystallized into color â "The Old Army Chest." wherein a
hardy warrior of the rebellion is showing his treasures to his beautiful
fair-haired daughter. Just register a deep-voiced complaint with your
carrier if you do not get this picture "with yoar G. A. R. Edition of the

police headquarters he gave the names of
his companions, and Forbes was arrested
at the telegraph office some time later.
The latter lad gave the details of the af
fair and said that owing to the fact that
they had entered MIbs Clemens* house
about one month ago and had found noth
ing, they decided to make another at
tempt.
Mr. Field, on a previous visit to Crock
ett, had noticed the 1100 sacks of grain ly
ing alongside the dock in a barge. Since
his last visit they had disappeared, and
no one could give him any information
as to where they had. been taken.
The general result of the inspection
only emphasized the Impression of the
amazing methods practiced by the Ep
pingers and those In tlÂ»elr employ.
Representatives of some of the banks
interested in the Epplnger case visited
the Eppinger warehouse at Crockett yes
terday to look into affairs there in which
they bad a claim. At the conclusion of
the visit President T. J. Field of the Bank
of Monterey, who was one. of the party,
said he intended^ to prosecute the Ep
pingers to a. finish.
Early yesterday morning a party com
posed of A. G. Platt. accountant for the
trustees; Attorney Gregory, representing
the American Banking Company;.Presi
dent T. J. Field and Attorney Gavin Me-
Nab, representing the Bank of Monte
rey; Attorney Max Blum, representing
M. Blum & Co., and L. R. Cofer, repre
senting the International Banking Com
pany, proceeded up to Crockett to taker
a general survey of the contents of tho
Epplnger warehouse there. Detective
Tom Gibson was on hand to show them
the modus operandi of receiving and
shipping grain.
The party examined with great interest
the scales, which were loaded with the
"false weight" attached by means 6f
shoemaker's wax. A practical demonstra
tion showed that it was an Inside esti
mate that during the busy grain 6eason
the scales would net a profit of about 5600
daily to the warehouse company. In other
words the scales would credit up to the
warehouse Bixteen pounds of wheat on
each truck loaxl of five sacks.
Next the visitors had their attention
called to the "wharf contrivance," where
by when loading ships one sack of wheat
out of a bunch of five was quietly slipped
out of the chute and never struck the
ship at all, which sack would again re
vert to the credit of the warehouse and
the managers.

his gallantry in rescuing three young
men from drowning on December 26, 1896.
A sailing boat capsized, throwing the
men into the water. One swam to shore
and the two others clung to the bottom
of the boat. These latter were rescued
by Cobb, who rowed out to them In a

Now regarding the testimony of Lynch re
garding the genuineness of the signatures In
question. Lynch . himself swore that he de
bated over nine months without coming to a
conclusion, but this expert Elsenschlmmel,
who has lens sense than the horse which his
name signifies, jumps In and says with audac
ity that they are forgeries. Tor a meas of
pottage he would swear a man's liberty away.
He states the' forgeries could be discerned
miles away, and that they loom upÂ»llke the
electric light tower at San Jose. I would
not convict my enemy's dog upon such "testi
mony. Some experts are Inclined to give tes
timony upon the side that pays them. .
And now about these missing papers! Where
are- these missing papers? The witnesses
swell ud their official bosoms and can give
no account of where they are.
WHERE ARE .THE PAPERS?
Now, I want to say a word about this Inac
cessible room to which only Dillard and the
deputy were supposed to have keys â this pri
vate secret chamber. Why, the room was
open to everybody. It was used as a lunch
room! It was ueed as a resort to gain inspi
ration from a black bottle. One gallant soul
from Los Angeles had even used the room to
change his linen in, and it was here in this
sacred room, this holy of holies, that this
busy, overworked Collector sought refuge from
the burdens of daily life In his office, and
here found time to devote to the discussion of
political literature. The witnesses for the
Government swore that Dillard and he alone
had access to this room. It was not so.
Lynch had been, according to his own state
ments, a terribly overworked man, and his
great multiplicity of duties had kept his time
to engrossed that he was obliged to let any one
around his office do his work, even Intrusting
oome of the most important work of the office
to his porter. And now he comes and tries to
throw himself on the mercy of the , court.
There was nc rule of law that could excuse
him for not attending to his duty. Now, when
I come to these sleuth hounds, or, I will say,
simple sleuths â tbese men who work as the
lilies do, who toil . like the butterflies, this
noble, gallant band of men all banded together
against this poor colored man, W. H. Dll
lard, to try and fasten the guilt on him, I
will say that they would have been glad If
Dillard had never come back, and It would
have been a great relief to them if he had
remained away. $
The prosecution were next berated as
"a lot of cheap politicians who had gone
into the dark chambers of a Grand Jury
and Induced the Jurors to prefer charges
against Dillard." Incidentally, the Grand
Jury was referred to as a relic of the
dark ages.
After the noon recess the speaker gave
his attention to commenting upon the
heavy work that the Government had
thrust on Lynch. He said in part:
LYNCH WEIGHTED WITH WORK.
The argument in the Dillard trial yes- i
terday was remarkable â¢ for a severe ver- ;
bal onslaught on the part of Samuel !
M. Shortrldge, who made United States |
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch his ;
target. The lawyer did not devote the !
greater part of the time consumed by him
in sifting the evidence and marshaling
the facts to prove that his client, who is !
accused of forging the name of Collector
Lynch, was innocent, but he made a
general attack upon the prosecution
and its witnesses, denouncing them as
conspirators and perjurers. He rebuked
the United States District Attorney be- J
cause that official had not assisted>in the j
defense of the clever negro clerk of the I
revenue office, and he declared that Col- j
lector Lynch was a man of no character I
for bravery or honesty. In fact, he in
sinuated, fo put it mildly, that Mr. Lynch
hud lied while on the stand. ?
Attorney T. C. West opened the argu-
r ment for the defense at 9 o'clock and
occupied the attention of the court until
10:30, when Mr. Shortridge took the floor,
and, barring a recess for lunch and a
rest for his talking hand, spoke until after
4 o'clock. At this juncture Judge de ]
Haven inquired as . to how much more
time Mr. Shortridge desired to finish his
argument, and being informed that he re
quired half an hour more, the Judge ad
journed court until 10 o'clock this morn
ing.
According to the testimony, said Short
ridge, Lynch seems to have abdicated his
office. All that he did was to sign his
name like an automaton to some papers
regardless of what they were.
"He tells us that he swore to the truth
of a certain paper, not knowing what It
was. Dillard had very many duties to
perform and he performed them. Had
the Collector of Internal Revenue any
duties to perform? Are we to say that
Lyrich had no duty to perform at all, or
that he shirked, neglected and overlooked
it? Should Dillard be held responsible for
a mistake, an oversight in the rush of,
business, and at the same time should we
say that Lynch is excusable for his mis
takes committed in the rush of business?"
CRITICIZES LYNCH'S COURAGE.
The speaker, in commenting upon the
testimony in reference to a letter dated
April 22, 1902, which Dillard sent to Chin
ese Inspector Charles Mehan at El Paso,
Texas, said:
If Lynch had more courage or more charac
ter he would come manfully Into court and
say, "I did dictate that letter, and I find
that I wu mistaken." If he had been man
enough, big enough mentally, just enough in
character and fearless enough, he would have
come into court and said, "I made a mistake."
It is a test of character for a man to step
up and say, "Yes, X did wrong, and I apolo
gize." When you take character out of a
man he becomes a piece of walking flesh;
that's all. If he had been content to be a big
man, if he had been of the breed of big men,
he would have said, "I made a mistake here;
this letter is mine." If he had been brave
and truthful and manly he would have said,
"I made this mistake, and hej didn't do It."
I was shocked to hear him deny the genuine
ness of his signature to -that letter. It was
horrifying, it was terrible. It was an exhi
bition which stamps hia whoU testimony as
unworthy of belief.
Dillard Trial Â»Is Enlivened
by Verbal Assault
on Officials.
Legal Argument Made
a Cover for Severe
DenunciatioD.
The Mendelssohn "Fingal's Cave" over
ture opened th* concert; the "Peer Gynt"
suite cf Grieg ("La Mort d'Ase"â with an
exquisite pianissimo, "La. Danse d'Anl
tra," lilted irresistibly) was another
number, and the "Tannhauser" overture
closed the programme â a truly classic one.
It need hardly be said that the applause
was generous, a perfect ovation greeting
the conductor at the close of the after
noon. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Th<- symphony of the afternoon was the
Schumann No. 2, C major, and nowhere
on the programme was Mr. Scheel's grip
on his men more In evidence than in its
tricksy "scherzo,"â an "asses* bridge" for
conductors and men. The rendering was
pay, buoyant and charmingly sensitive,
the showers of notes falling with the
ppeed and lightness of an April rain.
H<-re. too, is where the strings came in.
Some parts of the first movement were
elso beautifully given, with a suave,
broad sweep that would have satisfied
Schumann himself. The elow movement
somehow lacked character and tonal full
ness, though It wanted nothing in tender
n<-ss, and the swinging finale demanded
even further freedom and climax. But
this is hypcr-criticismâ Mr. Scheel's own
fault from the general excellence of the
work!
UStVOal gayety of the carnivalâ like
"'I>?vertiments." both movements admir
ably conducted and played- There is a
ppot of woodwind color and movement in
the intermezzo that is of Tgcfcajkowsky's
prettiest, as indeed are both movements.
Yesterday's concert was, of course, the
first, but really wonderful in the delicacy
of the effects achieved, in the sensitive
ness of the work. But it was still quite
possible to maintain the conventional re
lations of one's head and feet, a feat that
will. I fancy, be difficult of achievement
in another concert or two. Tbe loving,
luminous detail that distinguishes Scheel's
work at times rather obscured the larger
outlines of the things, but promised the
best for the coming efforts of the or
chestra. The tone, too, of the band, is
hardly yet settled, and to prevent the
n:ramon tonal sourness and stridency of
first performances the conductor rather
held down the volume.
Possibly both conductor and orchestra
vrere at their best in the new Tschaikow
sky suite â wherein Tschaikowsky himself
is at high tide. Very fascinating is the
Kalmuck color of the "Intermezzo." the
evidence in th<Â» work of the orchestra.
\Y>ak spots there are. some need of new
blood, but the body of the work is so
good, the leading men so satisfying, that
one can only hope for the early strength
ening of the vulnerable points of the
band. Particularly pood is the woodwind
choir, but throughout the men made a
Dew record for themselves yesterday.
Schecl himself returns to us with new
resource, a deeper maturity, and not less
fire than he took with him when he left
here five years ago. He gripped his men
with the first beat of his majestic baton,
and dropped them only with the
last. â¢ â¢ â¢ One .finds anew an eminent
s*nn:ty lti Scheel's art. The head and
heart of it are most nicely balanced, its
fervent temperamental quality not less
marked than Its pure braininess. The
conductor has possibly more repose than
formerly, a larger authority, an even
more fastidious polish, and it will be a
study th<> most fascinating to hear these
things getting: into the blood of the or
chestra during the coming concerts.

ALTURAS, Aug. 14.â While electrician

power-house on Wednesday * about mid
night, two men entered ; and asked for
water. Mr. Gibblns noticed that one * of
the strangers resembled the picture
convict Miller, and naturally ... his * sus
picions were aroused.- He noticed. that
the two men wore their hats pulled down
over their eyes, and, upon looking close

clipped. The men loitered around awhile
and finally after inquiring the road lead
ing north took their departure.
Sheriff Street was afterward . notified
and made a . search for the, men , but
could find no trace of , them. ; It is the
opinion of Gibbins, and also of Mr. Yates,
who was in the power-house at the time,
that the men were Miller â¢ and , one ' more
of the convict band. They tallied exactly
to the pictures and descriptions.

party. Sir Thomas was left alone wltU
the Pontiff, and, when he wished to
kneel, the Pope most amiably stretched
out his hand and asked him to be seated
at his side. Sir Thomas presented the
congratulations of the Irish party
upon the Pope's succession, and the Pon

Irish were very dear, loyal people, and
that he wished them all prosperity and

Speculation concerning the appointment
of Secretary of State continues to be en
grossing at the Vatican. There* has been
a suggestion that Cardinal Gotti should
be appointed to this post, oh the ground
that such an appointment would pleasa
Germany and Austria, and that Cardinal
Rampolla should replace Gotti as Prefect
of the Propaganda, thus Insuring the
protection of France's Interests In the
Far East. It Is not believed, however,
that the suggestion will prove acceptable
to the Pope. Others believe that the
Pope Is trying to overcome the excessive
modesty of Cardinal Satolli in order to
Induce him to accept the position.
Plus X has signified his Intention of oc
cupying the apartment in which the late
Pope lived, and the furniture Is. now be

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 14.â The latest
feature in the contest for the reward for
the capture of James Roberts is that un
der the terms of a recent Supreme Court
decision none of the parties fighting for
the prize money Is entitled thereto. Rob
erts was taken on the banks of Putall
Creek, Yolo County, by a posse made up
of Deputies Edward Reese, George Wlt
tenbrock and John Hinters and two Da
visvllle constables. Hinters asserts he
leveled the rifle that caused Roberts to
surrender and that he clasped the ?hand
cuffs on his wrists and claimed him as
his prisoner. Sheriff David Reese and
HinterS escorted Roberts to Folsom pris
on, and Hinters took the precaution to
secure a personal receipt from the prison
authorities for the recaptured fugitive.
Sheriff Reese protested against the issu
ance of the receipt to Hinters, but War
den Wilkinson declined, to Interfere. Hin
ters claimed the reward before the State
Board of Examiners and Sheriff Reese
contested his claim.
It now appears that under a ruling of
the Supreme Court neither Reese nor
Hinters Is entitled to the reward. Sev
eral years ago Mr. and Mrs. F. H. L.
Weber were- murdered In Sacramento and
a Russian named Ivan Kovalev was
wanted for the crime. He was captured
by Captain of Detectives I. W. Lees of
San Francisco, who claimed the $1000 re
ward offered by the State. The Board of
Examiners" allowed the claim, but State
Controller Colgan refused to draw his
warrant for the amount. The matter was
finally taken to the Supreme Court and
that body held that as Lees was a peace
officer of San Francisco It was his duty
to arrest Kovalev in the ordinary dis
charge of his duties and he was entitled
to no reward. The court held that it
would not be good policy to permit peace
ofllcers working for a fixed salary to take
reward moneys, asÂ»the practice would in
duce them to wait until, a reward was
offered before making arrests.
It Is now claimed that as the crime of
breaking prison and assaulting the guards
occurred in Sacramento County it was the
duty of the county officials to arrest the
offenders without the inducement of a re
ward.

The officers of the squadron deny all
knowledge of the story wired from Port
Townsend that the entrance, of the fleet
into the Sound was a naval maneuver,
und- that "Admiral Casey" constructively
ran a formidable blockade successfully
and achieved a mighty victory.
Admiral Casey was not on board any
of the vessels of the fleet and has no con
nection with It. If the entrance of the
ileet was a successful naval maneuver,
the vessels, the officers say, are entitled
to extraordinary commendation, since they
tarried it through without the knowledge
of the men who were navigating them.

Pacific squadron of the United States
Navy, Rear Admiral Glass commanding,

PLACERVILLE. Aug. 14.â The Sheriff's
posse, consisting of Deputy Sheriff Gillis
cock, John A. Spencer, R. E. Moherter
and Frank Dygert, who left here Friday
last with C. E. Ferrel and his two blood
hounds for Dogtown in pursuit of the
escapedfeonvicts, returned to Placerville
at 2 o'clock yesterday morning,' Ferrel
having gone on straight to .Nevada with
the hounds from "Klrkwood Station. The
posse arrived at Dogtown' at noon last
Saturday, but had they been better in
formed ns to the location and route of
the convicts' they would ] have gone di
rect* to Grizzly Flats and there they
would have secured further information
which in all probability would have en
abled them to intercept the outlaws.
When within a few miles of Grizzly Flats
they struck northeast. .From Dogtown,
under, the direction of an Indian guide
named Hunter, ' they proceeded to the
Meiss sheep ranch, and; finding nothing,
went on to Cappa Crossing. Near there
is the sheep ranch and cabin where the
convicts at noon on Saturday took from
an old German sheepherder a pair of
overalls, two pies and a supply of pro
visions. When Deputy Sheriff Cook and
his posse arrived there it was. 9 o'clock
Sunday morning, about twenty hours
after the convicta had departed. From
there Cook's men followed the trail to
Leaks Springs, where' they arrived at 6
p. m. Sunday night.
Cook on arriving at Dogtown had dis
patched a messenger to tell Sheriff Nor
man of Amador County to go direct to
Leaks Springs and he (Cook) would fol
low the trail, but Norman had gone to
another station and did not get to Leaks
Springs till 2 p. m. on Sunday, and during!
that time the com* ts were pushing on to
Andersons. Evidently having observed |
something in their course that aroused >.
their suspicion, they swung around to :
DeVil's Slide and struck northwest to Sil- [
ver Lake. Norman's party had also struck
out for Silver- Lake and when the Cook
party had got to Silver Lake Norman's
party had gone on about six miles far
ther to Klrkwood Station. The surround
ing country was examined and Moherter,
Dygert and the guide Hunter guarded
Tragedy Springs both Monday and Tues
day nights, but other than a report made
by some "' of "Norman's men that about
three miles northeast from Kirkwoqd it
was thought the convicts were located,
neither party succeeded in accomplish
ing anything. Sheriff Norman, with four
of his men, started for Lake Tahoe. the
balance of his men returning home
Wednesday morning.
The convicts are now in Alpine County
and are making for Nevada with all their
energy, their plan apparently being to
strike sheep camps and shape their
course through desolate places. The
country is of granite formation, and while
In some places the trail is clear, yet
patches of rock will intervene which baf

In deciding* the. suit of the Tonopah
Mining Company against the Tonopah and
Salt Lake Mining Company in favor of
the defendant Judire Hawley laid down
the following legal doctrine:.
When a ' valid location of a mining ' claim
is once â¢ made it vests In the locator and his
successors " in Interest the right ; of â¢ possession
thereto... which ' right . cannot toe\ divested by
the obligation or removal, without the fault
of the locator or his successors in interest, of
the stakes and monuments marking its
boundaries, or of the obliteration or t removal
from the claim of the location notices posted
thereon. The right- of the original locators to
change their original' location, so long as such
change does '- not interfere with the existing
rights of ' others acquired previous to such
change. Is unquestioned. The amended â¢ certifi
cate of location, when made, becomes the com
pleted location of the discoverer, ; and Is Just
as valid as If It had been made in the first
Instance.

mines at New Almaden is handllng*4000
tons of ore per month. Six furnaces "are
in operation."
Operations have been resumed at the
turquoise mines near Manvel, San Ber
nardino County.
The accumulations of the dumps at the
Rose Hill mine, In Nevada County, on
Winchester Hill, will be crushed with new
machinery. In early days only the high
grade ores were crushed. There are 5000
tons of low grade rock on the Rose Hill
dump to be milled. The Rose Hill mine
is between the North Star and the Em
pire. It has been worked at various times.
A strike in the Menlo mine, in Nevada
County, is reported. This is an old min
ing property.
The Rescue Joining Company has been
organized to work the Coon Crossing gold
mine, near Rescue, El Dorado County. A
five-stamp mill will be erected.
The mining Industry in Nevada County
Is taking an upward turn. So much work
is in progress that labor is in demand.
Notices are posted offering employment at
good wages, and still there is a scarcity
of men to work in the mines. This is the
substance of a review by the Nevada
County Miner, which asserts that the pe
riod of depression is passing away and ac
tivity is its successor:
Xew properties that heretofore have been
merely prospected are now being developed and
old properties long abandoned are being worked
15 < larEe f Â°rces or men. Mines where a
Eood force has been employed are ' extending
and Â¦ enlarging their operations and to do so
are employing more miners. Rich Btrlkes made
in different localities, in mine.s that were
once abandoned and said to he "worked out"
have srlven an Impetus to the industry and
strengthened the confidence of mining men in
the future outlook of the district. Then are
new deals In mining property frequently and In
most instances the purchasers increase the
working force. There are a number of min
ing men of experience In the county striving
quietly to gain control of properties that are
not being worked. They will succeed In cloe
ing their deals and will put the properties on" 1
the active list, when many more men will be
required. It has been many years sinco the
outlook of the mining industry In Nevada
County was brighter tlmn it la now. -

reason he advises caution in the use of
oils. In the case of the black scale on
!]:<â¢ orange trees he finds that the first
spraying with a 28 degree B distillate of
from two to three per cent dilution re
sults in the death of most of the scales.
The red spider, another enemy of citrus
trees, offers a difficult problem, as many
of the mites escape and multiply again
po that they soon reinfest the tree.
None of the pprayings can be done
without more or less injury to the fruit,
though at certain times of the year it is
possible to spray without Injury. The
injuries are manifest in the falling of the
leaves and fruit and the yellowing and
slower falling of these parts, resulting
from prolonged or chronic effects of the
distillate.
To minimise the amount of injury. Mr.
Volck suggests choosing the least injuri
ous oils, which usually contain the most
kerosene. Pure Eastern kerosene gives
the best results, but Western kerosenes
are good, too.

All this present talk about "race sui
cide" suggests at least one interesting
idea. The large cities are no places for
the rearing of large families. Cities are
simply intensified centers of social, indus
trial and commercial activity, necessarily
crowded, necessarily huddled, and suita
ble to live in- only because what some
men must do and^what some men .must
have is there to be done and to be got.
The country and the town are the feeders
for the city, for city stock decays after
a time in the modern rush. The city is
the place to concentrate racial and indi
vidual energy on the public needs; "it is
not ; the place for race replenishment.
Nations are liable to die at the top; they
get bald before they lose the strength of
their legs; and the replenishment of the
brain must come from the heart, and the
lungs, not from .itself. Let the 'country-
Bide and the towns continue to rear, sturdy
citizens and continue to* send some of
them, with an increasingly improved
equipment, Â¦'. to take up the struggle in
the cities.â The Week's Progress. â¢

Fifty-nine plat books at $16 each were
printed. . The order was hypothecated to
Mrs. Putnam, a sister of M. de L. Had
ley, who was the business manager of the
Enquirer Publishing Company. She was
led to believe she could make a small fee
by advancing the money, which she did.
Between Russell Steadman, an agent ; of
the company, who received the money,
and Dalton the ; money was lost in the
shuffle.. Steadman , claims he gave the
money to Dalton, and Dalton claims that
if any money was received Steadman kept
It himself:. The Ennquirer never received
it, and Mrs. Putnam holds the hypothe
cated order. They have each been con
ducting a fight . before , the Supervisors,
and the Enquirer has now taken the mat
ter into the courts.
Â¦ Suit was commenced to-day against. Ala
meda County for a bill of $944 that has
become famous. The plaintiff is the Oak.
land Enquirer Publishing Company, and
it alleges that the county owes it the
money for printing done nearly two years
ago. The claim has been the .cause of
endless trouble, and seemingly the end is
not yet.
There are two claimants for the money,
and between their adverse interests the
Board of Supervisors has been' unable to
decide who has the better right to it.
This is the outcome of the famous $1500
claim which resulted In the indictment of
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton. G. B.
Daniels and George Oakes in what the
Grand Jury said was an attempt on the
part of. these men to defraud. the county.
Dalton gave an order, for, printing for this
amount to George Oakes, and the money
was paid by the Supervisors to Oakes and
Daniels, who turned the money over to
Dalton. It was afterward discovered that
the printing had never been done. On the
day Dalton was to be brought to trial he
paid the amount into the county treasury
and the case fell.
It .was contended at that time by Dal
ton ; that owing to a miscalculation the
order had to be abandoned, but another
had been given in its place. This was for

It has looked, however, as If the county
had small chance of catching up with
him, even at this rate, for he was al
lowed to get a good start before this
scheme was hit upon." â¢
. ; For 4'number of years Dalton has pre
pared the ; assessment rolls for Oakland
and for 'Â¦ this he has been : plild ' at the
rate of o cents a' folio. For each year
this" work amounted to about $3000. This
year it was about $3200. ',
' When the county government act went
into; effect Jail county officers were given
regular salaries and the fee system was
abolished. ; Dalton's salary, is $4000 a year.
In addition to this, however, he has each
vear Â¦ retained the amount received from
the city of Oakland for his private use;
with the exception of what Â¦ the work
actually cost. As testified to before the
late Grand Jury it , cost Dalton $86 to
prepare the assessment roll this year, for
which he collected from the city of Oak
land $3200. Each year the. Grand Jury
has instructed the Board of Supervisors
to bring suit and the courts have decided
against him and given the county'Judg
ments for sums aggregating more than
$12,000. ' ' â¢ V Â¦--.-Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦

Most hotel clerks dislike to see the reg
ister closed. Some of them say that their
desire to have It remain open is In order
that it may be ready for the signatme of
guests. But there are other clerks who
don't mind telling the real reason. It is
because they have a feeling that It is
unlucky to close the register. It la a sort
of superstition. Just as other people hava
against doing things on Friday, or be
ginning a Journey on the 30th of the
month. Hotels are not more given to
superstition than are people, although
there is no room No. 13 In most of them.
While the superstition Is not generally
well known among people who travel. It
does not often happen that a clerk is
compelled to rush to the desk, in order to
prevent a guest from closing the book.
That is what happened at one of the big
hotels recently, and it was because the
absent-minded man would have closed
the book that the clerk told of the feel
ing most hotel clerks have about the bad
luck that will follow thti closing of the
register. It is a good deal like the men
tal attitude of the small boy who crosses;
his fingers when a cross-eyed person
looks at him.
"Of course," . said the clerk, "I do not
think It makes any difference. In fact. 1
am sure it doesn'tâ but I never allow the
book to bq closed during my watch 'if I
can beat the other fellow to it. Hotel
registers are to be written in, anyway,
and a man can't write in them If they ara
closed."â Kansas City Journal.

OAKLAND, Aug. 14.â The following

For five days the policeman wandered
blindly over the prairie, losing all count
of time, eating snow to quench his thirst
and Bleeping in the holes that the br.on
cho had pawed through the ice crust to
the under grass. The trooper was now
too weak to mount and keep the saddle.
As a last hope the thought struck him
that if he unsaddled his horse and turned
it loose it might find Its way back to the
fort and so notify his friends that he, was
lost- He did this, but the faithful crea
ture refused to leave the man lying on
the snow and stood over him In spite of
all his efforts to drive it- off. On the
sixth day the mail carrier found the pair.
The trooper was severely frozen, but the
rider and horse lived to see many anoth

An unfortunate was sent with a dis
patch to one of the smaller outposts In
the far Northwest. It was toward spring,
when the midday sun thaws thÂ« surface
of the snow and the light frosts harden
the melted crusts to a glace of Ice as daz
zllngly bright as the blinding flashes of
sunlight from polished steel. The thaw
had crusted over the trail and the scout
had to keep a- sharp eye on the way not
to lose the path altogether. Suddenly the
midday sun developed extraordinary hues.
Magenta, purple and black patches began
to dance on the show, alternately with
wheels and fockets of cheese colored fire.
Then the light went out altogether,
though the man knew that it was broad
day. He had become snow blind. The
only thing was to give his horse the bit.
The horse stood stock still. By that
time he knew that he had lost the trail
altogether or the broncho would have fol
lowed any visible path. He whaeled the
horse about. It still refused to go on and
then the man Inferred that tho crust of
Ice had been so hard that the horse could
not follow back the way It had come.
That night the trooper slept under saddle
blankets, with the faithful horse standing

The City Trustees did not 'take up the
matter of the railroad franchises to
night, as City Attorney Simpson was not
ready with the documents.
ALAMEDA, Augl 14.â Members of the
Citizens' Committee of Fifty and of the
Board of City Trustees have been ap
prised of the intention of- the Southern
Pacific. Company to next Monday night
withdraw Its application for a franchise
on the north side or Railroad avenue line.
The application for aVrenewal of a fran
chise on the south side or Encinal. avenue
line will be allowed to remain on the file
to be acted upon by the City Trustees.
It was also given out. to-day by a repre
sentative of the Southern Pacific that on
next Monday night there will be filed
with the City Trustees a communication
explaining the present attitude of ' the
management of the corporation with , re
spect to the matter of the franchises. It
is announced that/in that document the
company will state its refusal to pay
anything for the south side franchise;
that it will be willing to grant . a, twp
and-a-half-cent . local Â¦ fare, good' until
used; that it does not intend to pulKup
Its tracks in Alameda unless compelled
by the attitude of the Alameda public to
do so; that the management is desirous
of having the agitation settled one way
or another as soon as possible so that
the company may determine whether It
will expend $75,000 or $350,000 on improve
ments at the Alameda Mole; that the
officials of the Southern Pacific will hold
no more conferences with the people of
Alameda, but will leave the latter to
adjust the franchises as they see fit and
when they feel like doing so. It is also
understood that in the letter the com
pany will guarantee to give Alameda as
good service as It is now receiving and
make Improvements as rapidly as cir
cumstances will permit.
It is said that the management of the
Southern Pacific has taken to heart the
troubles of the people of Alameda with
the company and the demands made by
them, and regrets that the situation is
not amiable. If the city refuses to grant
the Southern Pacific a twenty-five, year
franchise on the south side line It is
planned by the corporation to divert all
through traffic from a point near San
Lorenao to the main line* running through
San Leandro and into Oakland.

Mr. Sbarboro says that If. , any one
should be successful In discovering the
process for the utilization of California
grapes to produce tartaric acid on a com
mercial basis such a process would be
of inestimable value to California and to
the United States. The United States is
a very large importer of grape acids
which are material for cream of tartar
dspite the fact that California Is a very
large producer , of grapes. The present
value of tartaric acid wholesale is 31 cents
a pound.
An association of California vineyard-
Ists has been formed, to be known as
the American Grape Acid Association, for
the purpose of solving the problem of the
production of crtam of tartar from Cal

out this secret will be paid $25,000, so says

The complaint recites that Miller & Lux
and the California Pastoral and Agricul
tural Company own an undivided one
half interest In the Cho wchilla canal In
Madera County, â¢ which, takes. water from
the San Joaquln River, and that the- San
Joaquln and Kings River Canal and Irri
gation Company owns the San Joaquin
and Kings River canal. It is alleged fur
ther that on August 17, 1S98, all the par
ties entered into a written agreement. that
the San Joaquln and Kings River Canal
and Irrigation Company should have the
prior right to divert water from the San
Joaquin River, so that its canal shall
receive 775 cubic feet of water per second
measured at ' the Poso canal, and that
it also mteht divert any : portion of 775
cubic feet from the main canal into the
canal referred to in the agreement as
the new canal of the San Joaquln and
Kings River Canal and " Irrigation Com
pany at a point above the point of meas
urement already mentioned. It was also
agreed that the California Pastoral and
Agricultural Company and Miller & Lux
should have the right generally to divert
water from the San Joaquin River into
the Chowchilla canal 120 - cubic feet in
excess of the 775 cubic feet supplied, to
the San Joaauin and Kings River Canal
and Irrigation Company. It is averred
that the California Pastoral and Agricul
tural Company transferred on October 10,
1901. all its right title and interest to
the California Pastoral and Agricultural
Company, Ltd., in the Chowchilla and all
Its rights under the agreement mentioned.
It is averred also that since December
9, 1901, Johnston and Fleming have held the
company's title to the Chqwchilla, etc.,
under a declaration of trust as security
for the payment by the California Pas
toral and Agricultural Company, Ltd.. of
debenture bonds Issued by that company.
Then the complaint goes on to say that
the. defendants diverted part of the 775
cubic feet of water per second from the
San Joaouin River into the Lone Willow
Slough and thence to the Columbia ca
nal,' which diversion was without any
foundation of law or right/ This was
done. It is alleged, against/ the pretest
of the California Pastoral and Agricul
tural Company, Ltd. It is/ alleged fur
ther that Miller & Lux confederated and
conspired with the San Joaquln ana Kings
River Canal and Irrigation Company in
such diversion, and thereby.'prevented the
complainant from using tha water for the
irrigation of Its lands. ' /
A dispute as to. the use of water for
irrigation in the Fresno and Madera dis
tricts was taken into the Unjted States
Circuit Court yesterday in the shape of
a suit for $10,000 damages and an ap

NEW YORK, Aug. 14. â There was another
uprush of prices to-day in further recovery
from thÂ« extreme depression of last week. So
violent did the movement become that it was
regarded with some suspicion and the princi
pal traders became very watchful for symp
toms of reaction in order to seize a ripening
opportunity for a shift to the short side for
a turn. The market showed abundant evi
dence of leadership and skillful management
and was held by transferring bull operations
from, one stock or group of stocks to another,
tcking profits in the one as buying was shifted
to another. News eeemed to have nothing to do
with the advance. The conviction was general
that necessary liquidation has been completed
for the present, and prices consequently were
left free to seek the level of true values. Little
was heard of yesterday's numerous stories re
garding Reading, which ranged ox - er,a wide
field of credulity and that stock was steadily
under pressure to take profits all day with the
sustaining strength at other points in the list.
It was not at any time more than a fraction
over last night and for the greater part of the
day wu below. The early strength in the
market was rÂ».ost conspicuous In Western
grain-carrying railroads, and the principal buy-
Ing shifted afterward to the eastern part of
the map, led by New York Central and fol
lowed by the other trunk line stocks. London
was reported an eager buyer of New York
Central, but no other news was forthcoming
t J explain the strength in stock. London was
a seller on the balance of the list In to-day's
market, the advance there falling to keep pace
with the movement here, and so offerings at
arbitrage profit in selling in this market all
day. The foreign exchange market was some
what affected and hardened on a demand for
remittances by to-r*rÂ»rrow's steamer. There
was great Interest in the question whether for
elÂ«-nerÂ« would resell Americans largely on the
advance in prices here. The United States
Steel stocks lagged in the upward movement
and were somewhat affected by the reports of
extensive shutting down of mills in Western
Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio. Amalgamat
ed Copper was held by a rise in the price of
metal here. In London there was a rise in
copper tutures, with a slight recession in the
price of spot. A feature of the day's news
was a report of sales of cash wheat at Minne
apolis for $1 a bushel. A violent upward
movement of 6% points In Amalgamated Cop
per sustained the late market, which had
shown signs of hesitation, as the last prices
"were often a little below the best, but the close
was strong and active. The day'Â« range was
from one to four points and the leading Pa
cific grangers, trunk lines and specialties were
ell strong. There were a few heavy spots in
the bond market but the tone was generally
strong. Total saJes, par value, $3,660,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.

li.ICES FOR SOUND STOCKS NOW CON
SIDERED TOO LOW.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"'One of the remarkable features in connection
with the depression of the last few weeks is
the absence cf panicky symptoms, notwith
standing the extraordinary declines; nor Is
there now any reason to anticipate panic, be
i Â»use prices are too low and sound condi
tions prevail cuttide of Wall street. Another
potent reason, however, for absence of panic
is the skillful manner in which the campaign
of liquidation has been conducted. Some ft
ihp more powerful interests may have been
'.nftrumental in forcing the decline; neverthe
:Â¦;Â¦>Â¦. strong partlf* have invariably stepped
into the breach and stopped the downward
aurtntat when it became too threatening,
thus giving those in difficulty a fair chance
to readjust themselves. Without this power
fol restraint there is no doubt worse condi
tions misrht have followed, and to this extent
the "street" is Indebted to the communlty
of-inter^st idea, which In times past has come
in for more than its chare of abuse. The men
who dominated vast aggregates of capital
,.-.'-Â»â¢ better than any others the great expan-
Eton in all sort *of obligations which culm!
r.ntcd in 19"2; they, too. knew better than
.try others that the legitimate rrowth of busi
:..is imx>erativ<?ly called for vast outlays of
: >w capital, which could not be deferred, and
which ir.uft Impose a strain upon the money
market that would fall disastrously upon all
pperulaUvc constructions. No doubt, with the
(oreslcbt which their ~~Â«itton gave them, they
uquwt in advance for the events now 'oc
curring, and which have been anticipated by
nil experienf<-d observers, who wondered not

Of course this power has hf-en used by those

Indebted to th<^e .mho put a stop to specula

Â¦ CHICAGO Aug. 14. â Trading was again ac
tive In wheat and the market was very strong
most of the day. The opening was firm on
higher cables with September up %Â©%c at
82c to 82ftc, but a little reaction set in. due
to the Impression that the claims or big ex
port demand made yesterday were somewhat !
exaggerated. The more favorable harvesting !
weather in the Northwest was also a depress
ing influence early. The depression was only
momentary, however, and after September had
sold off to 81 %c the market again turned
strong and as the session advanced the
strength became more pronounced. Shorts be- '
came alarmed at the cash situation in the
Northwest, where a car of No. 1 Northern was
reported to have sold at $1 per bushel (at
Minneapolis) and covered , freely toward the
noon hour. With a good demand for invest
ment account September advanced . to 62Vic,
but liquidation again set In, and part of the
advance was lost. The close was strong, how
ever, with September up 1Â®1%c at 82%@83c.
Trading In corn was quiet and the market:
on the whole was featureless. , September
closed V*<a%c lower at 52%c. '
Favorable weather ar.d increased : receipts"
were responsible for an easier tone in oats.
September, closed a shade lower at 35%c. Â¦
Provisions were firm early on a better tone
in the hog market, but later the market eased
off on selling by brokers. September pork
closed 7}4c lower, lard was off 2.&C while ; ;rlbs
were down 5*37*4 cents. Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦ .:

The Cross of St. Andrew, which the
Czar has Just presented to General Prince
Louis Napoleon, has a very remarkable
peculiarity attaching to It. All those who
are decorated with, thia order have thÂ«
right once In their lives to demand a par
don for a Russian subject who has been
condemned to death. ' The ungracious
part of this privilege is that it by no
mean* follows that the condemned man
will be reprieved, but. at any rate, the
poor wretch has a chance, for his case is
thus brought directly to the notice of the
Czar, without the intervention of any of
ficials, and, unless there is something po
litical about his crime, the probability is
that he will escape with his life.â London

The coffee chewing, habit Is one-, that is
confined In the main to the employes of
coffee roasting plants. Nearly all the men
who work In these plants have tne habit,
and those who have It In excess, suffer
from it considerably. A physician said
of the strange indulgence: "Coffee chew
ing is a habit easily contracted, for the
taste' of Â¦ the crisp, roasted ; berries Is not
unpleasant, ' and . the ' exhilaration, - the
stimulus i that - they . give,. ' . is quite as
marked -as that which- would: be | obtained
from a glass or two of beer or from * a

Injurious "and worse than those of to
bacco chewing. The coffee chewing habi:

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Away out in the south Pacific ocean,
where white "men rarely are seen, there
lies a little coral atoll known as Hikueru
atoll. It is different from most coral atolls
of which you read in your geography, for
it Is a solid ring of coral and the lagoon
inside of it can be entered only by drag
ging boats over the beach.
This lagoon is one of the most valuable
pearl-shell lagoons and is sought every
yea,r by the dwellers on Tahiti and other
islands of the south seas to flsh for pearls.
The French Government, which owns
the atoll, has forbidden the use of diving
suits because it is feared that this method
would prove too destructive to the pearl
shells and the diving Is done in the an
cient south sea way, by men and boys
and women, who go down with no arti
ficial help.
When the time comes for the pearl-fish
ing they set out from their islands, some
of them 400 miles away from the atoll.
Most of the natives bring their families
and household effects with them. Many
bring even their houses. This is not so
difficult an undertaking as it may appear
at first sight, for the houses are made
from light cocbanut palms and pandanus
leaves. They are built up in sections; so
they" are easy to take apart and trans
port. â¢ â¢Â¦? Â¦-" - " i â¢ ~ = v â¢â¢â¢-v/ // Â¦" ~' â¢
Most of the" diving is done in water from
sixty to seventy/feet Â£eep. [The sea, is so
clear ; In the atolt that the diver can
study the bottom perfectly with a water
Klass and locate he best clumps of shell
before he dives.. . , --.-.. .Â¦-.< â¢
Â¦ When he is ready to , go down I he slips
into the water over the side of the boat
and, holding .to the .gunwale- with one
hand^Jhe looks- downward . through the
water glass. The moment . he â¢ sights a
good ] lot . of ' shells' ; he- begins i to .breathe
deeply, sucking in" the alr-until his chest
Is 'inflated as'fafaa If -can be," "and 7 then
exhaling it slowly" through the "moutn,
so that it makes a whistling sound. -Hav
ing thus cleaned out his lungs he takes
a long breath, filling hiÂ» chest with per
fectly pure air, and then he ' lets go of
the , gunwale, . instantly.. and sinks .below
the surface- feet -foremost. ; ; . .-. :,
â¢~ Af ter - he ; has tthus *-snnk2- abtrat r ten '.f eet
he ' turns Â¦ quickly < and swims toward the
bottom, head first, cleaving the water as
gracefully" and swiftly, as . a. fish would.
On touching bottom he hauls himself
along by seizing clumps of coral until he
reaches the' shells." .Then, he breaks them
off the reef with his right hand, which la
protected with white cotton cloth. . -
Quickly he puts the shells into a little
net â¢ of cocoanut fiber which, he carries
over hts shoulder. -.- Then he stands erect
and immediately he , shoots toward the
surface as if he were pulled up by a rope.
So 'swiftly "does he ascend that Â¦ he fre
quently ; seems .to' leap out of the water
when he reaches the "surface.
Of course boys and girls of these south
sea-islands can swim and dive almost as
well as if they were water dwellers. One
of them made an exhibition dive for the
officers of the United States Flsh Commis
sion steamship Albatross last year. He
remained under the ' water ' two minutes
and forty seconds : and reached . bottom
at a depth of 102 . feet under the boat's
keel. The water was so transparent that
the beholders could see him clearly. They
declare that after he had touched bottom
at this enormous depth he calmly picked
over the pieces of coral and shell at the
bottom to select one to bring up. exactly
as a man might. cull flowers when work
ing at his ease in a garden.. This young
diver was ready to go down again only
a, few minutes after; he came up.âBalti

LONDON, Aug. 14.â Neither at the
American nor at the other interested em
bassies is anything known regarding the
statement made in last night's dispatch
from Yokohama that Prince Chlng had
secured. Russians" consent to the use of
President Roosevelt's good offices in con
nection with the Manchurian difficulty.

The young wife was a devout Catholic,
and when some one at the meeting of her
"improvement club" read a paper, pre
dicting the eventual extermination of
food fish she was much perturbed. At
dinner that Friday night she looked wor
ried and her husband asked the reason.
"Whatever will we do, Frank, when the
fish are all used up?" she asked.* "What
can we eat on Friday?"
"Fish all used up?" he exclaimed: "I
don't quite understand you, my dear."
"Well, at the meeting to-day Mrs. Jones
said that it was only a question of time
until food fish would be so scarce that
only the rich could afford them. You
know we anÂ» not rich."
"What reason did she give?" he asked
gravely, as the situation demanded. .
"Oh, we are -killing so many' millions
of them every year that the poor things
don't get a chance to raise families."
The husband furrowed his brow, as good
husbands should when little wives . have
troubling questions. He 4 remembered' some
of his natural history and he had the an
swer. ,.â Â¦ Â¦. Â¦ â¢
.'.'There were fish, bit dear, centuries and
centuries before, there i. were enough peo
ple on earth to eat any quantity of them.
Yet in" those prehistoric days there were
terrible monsters, which fairly gorged
themselves with. the daintiest fish in the
sea. There was the gigantic" dinlchthys,
with a mailed head three feet long and
jaws full of cruel teeth. Then there was
the Ichthyosaurus, thirty or forty feet
long, with a pointed snout like a dolphin,
which fairly sucked in the flsh by the
thousands. Then the longnecked pleslosau
rus was a mighty fish killer. None of
these terrible" beasts exist ; to-day, so you
see the fish have a better chance for in
creasing than they had before. Don't you
worry; there will be flsh enougbyfor Fri
day as long as the world lasts."
The young wife was bewildered by "this
display of knowledge. "I did not know
you knew so much !" she exclaimed. "I
am so prlad you told me."â New York

ALBANY, Ga.. Aug. . 14.â Officers to
night deny the reported lynching of King
Wightman, a negro, ' and Thompson, a
white man, at Hartsfleld yesterday for
an attack upon Mrs. Mathis, a white
woman. Two men, who, Mrs. Mathis
says, were her assailants, were placed
in jail at Moultrie, Ga., after the officers
Save Culprit From" Lynchers.
Four houses were burned to the ground
at an early hour this morning" in the!Pre
sidio district. . L. ; B. House,., proprietor
of <â¢. a candy factory, .where the fife- had
its origin,' is missing : and nothing has
been seen of him since the fire started.
It; is believed he lost his life. "X .
The blaze started In House!s. candy
kitchen on Greenwich street, near Baker,
shortly before: 2 o'clock^ .An alarm;;was
turned ; in \ from box 425.- but .before the
engines arrived on the scene the three
adjoining houses. had caught; fire and the
flames were beyond control. % .'-.i' '-~i-\
The fire laddies fought braveV. and' their
efforts saved a number of , houses \ and
stores in the vicinity. The house of Mike
Holland,' a saloon-keeper, was the second
to.be attacked by the flames, and a short
time later the clothing store of S. Frank
lln and the residence of N. Mitchell .were
enveloped . Jn flames. v The occupants of
the dwellings had -a narrow escape from
death and bav-ely saved themselves, as
all were asleep. when the fire broke out.
House, the man who is supposed to have
been burned -to death, was last seen-.late
last night In the kitchen of his place. He
is supposed to have retired soon after.
The loss amounts to about $15,000. Two
of the -.buildings, contained merchandise
that was not insured. The .cause -Of the
fire is unknown, but" it is supposed . to
have been caused by sparks from, a chim
ney. - . "*. '.- ' - Â¦Â¦?.-Â¦Â¦
Regarding the report from Yokohama
that Prince Chine of the Chinese For
eign. Office had obtained Russia's consent
to the use of President Roosevelt's .good
offices in connection with the Manchu
rjan difficulty, it can be said that noth
ing is known here. The President has
received,- no intimation that he has even
been considered as an arbitrator of the
Manchurian troubles.
Carlisle's visit was. on^ a" private .mat
ter, but the President embraced the op
portunity to talk briefly to him on the
subject of financial legislation. Bishop
Rooker called to pay his . respects and to
discuss with the President the situation
in the Philippines. He is one of the four
American Bishops recently appointed for
service in the archipelago. He whi sail
for Manila on September 17. Lauterbach,
who is one of the counsel for Represen
tative LJttauer in the glove contract In
vestigation, discussed that matter briefly
with the President.
Late this afternoon former Secretary
of the Treasury John G.. Carlisle. D. T.
Flynn, for several years delegate from
Oklahoma in the House of Representa
tives; Bishop. Frederick Z. . Rooker, who
until recently; was secretary of the papal
delegation .. in Washington, and Edward
Lauterbach of New York r called on the
President." ' . -Â«.
OYSTER BAY, L. I., Ang.. 14.â Financial
legislation and other work* of the pro
posed extraordinary session of Congress
were discussed to-day " by j the ' President
and | his , callers, who included I Secretary
Shaw and Senator Cullom . and Comp
troller of the Currency' Ridgeley. Consid
erable opposition ' has developed to the
idea of, calling the extra session- in Octo
ber. The point is" made that many Sena
tors and Representatives will be engaged
durfna; .'October in "their State campaigns
and i that. It' would be politically unwise
for them to leave their States at such a
time. It was" announced that no definite
conclusion regarding the date of the ex
traordinary session has j been reached.
Senator Cullom -and Comptroller Ridge
ley discussed the financial situation with
the President with special reference to
the necessity for currency legislation.
Thus far about the only proposal on
which nearly, all. seem' to. be agreed is
that the proposed legislation should in
clude a provision for the depositing of
customs receipts in national banks.

BODEO RESIDENTS BRING
THEIR TROUBLES TO COURT
A. Alper, N. Ohlandt and Thomas
Collins Sue the Tormeys and A.
S. Carman for Damages.
Two suits for damages growing- out of
the row that has been raging among the
residents of Rodeo for some months past
were filed with the County Clerk yester
day. The plaintiffs in one of the actions,
which is a suit for $61,000 damages, are A.
Alper and X. Ohlandt, and the defendants
are Patrick Tormey and A. S. Carman.
The other suit, brought by Thomas Col
lins against Patrick and T. L. Tormey, is
a suit for $10,000 damages for false impris
onment.
Alper and Ohlandt allege that they have
been damaged to the extent of $61,000 by
the assertions of Tormey and Carman
that they were not the owners of certain
land in Rodeo, thereby preventing them
from consummating a sale of the land to
the Union Distilling Company. Collins
claims that his reputation was injured
$10,000 because T. L. Tormey, at the insti
gation of Patrick Tormey. caused his ar
rest on a charge of stealing a steel rail
valued at $30.
Edward Clark,, alias tiunter, was ar
rested by Detectives O'Dea and Mulcahey

A lively skirmish between a number of

The arbitration committee, of which the
Mayor Is chairman, will make an at
tempt to have the linemen call upon Pres
ident . Sabin and have the Ions strike
ended. â¢ ,
The following letter which the president
sent to the Mayor was read and sets
forth the telephone company's position:
Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany. Office of the President. San Fran
cisco Aug. 14. 1003.
Hon E. E Schmitz. Mayor City and County
of San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: In accordance
with your letter of even date, which we re
ceiver" after noon to-day. I beg leave to make
the following: statement: -_*
About three months ago the Linemen s union
at 1-os Angeles submitted terms for this com
pany's acceptance which were not agreeable
to us and a strike was called by the union.
About two months ago It was evident to the
Linemen's Union at Los Angeles that they had
lost their strike as we had plenty of men
to carry on our business. Then the Western
Conference, with a view to making this com
pany accede to the demands In Los Angeles,
called a sympathetic strike, after this company
was served with demand that unless certain
conditions were agreed to a strike would be
called all over the Pacific Coast. This com
pany did not agree to those conditions and a
strike was called and is now on. The stage
of the proceedings now la that your Honor
is pleased to call me to your office to confer
with you and a committee of the Board of
Supervisors as to the adjustment of this
strike. I beg to call i your attention to the
fact and it Is a fact, as I notified your Honor
in writing on July 27. that as far as the city
and county of San Francisco Is concerned the
telephone company is serving all of Its pa
trons in as perfect a manner as before the
strike. We have enough linemen who are
agreeable to the rules of this company to car
ry on 'all of our business. The question of
whether the linemen of the city and county
of San Francisco desire to return to work or
not is one for themselves to determine.
I respectfully submit that no citizen, of San
Francisco is being injured .by this so-called
strike- that there is nothing for you gentle
men itnd myself, as citizens of the city and
county of San Francisco, to adjust Aa I have
told you in writing, and also In person when
you were kind enough to call at my office,
this company Is willing now and has been at
all times to see any present or former em
ployes of this company and discuss any griev
ances that they may have, but it seems to me
that you and your honorable committee can
hardly expect that we should annoy you or
take up your time In any way regarding the
strike of telephone men In .places outside of
San Francisco.
Before the strike we had. on the Pacific
Coast, In round numbers. 1C00 linemen. Five
hundred men went on strike: 600 remained.
The 600 who remained have been harassed and
annoyed dally and hourly to quit work and
Join the unions. These 800 men who stood
by the company will never be dismissed from
its service with my consent because they do
not Join a union.*. On the other hand no man
working for this company will be dismissed
because he belongs to a union If he attends
to his business and permits me to attend to
mine.' Yours truly.
JOHN I. SABIN. President.
The linemen's strike is nearing a set
tlement. The committee appointed to
bring about a compromise between the
employes and the Pacific States Telephone
and Telegraph Company are working en
ergetically to that end. There was a

ent. There was a general discussion over
the claims of the linemen. Mr. Sabin
stated that he was willing to meet a
committee of striking: linemen at . any
time. He expressed himseii as being op
posed to meetlnjr linemen not connected
with his company.

Another victim who at once identified
Busch was A. J. Sbarboro, who lives at
2307 Mason street. Sbarboro was on' his
way home on Wednesday night when a
man with a revolver pointed it at him
and ordered him to throw up his hands.
As Sbarboro was unarmed and the foot
pad had the drop on him he broke away
and ran. When he saw Busch in the City
Prison yesterday morning he made a rush
at him. intending to attack him, but was
restrained by the prison officials.
The fourth victim was Frank O'Donnell,

Judge Kerrigan granted Olive A. Walsh
an interlocutory decree of divorce from
Dr. Robert L. Walsh, dentist, on the
ground of extreme cruelty. Mrs. Walsh
was awarded the custody of their one

Anne Menn'from Charles Menn for ne->

for neglect, Maria J. Flores from Antone
Flores for cruelty and Amelia Werner
from W. L. Werner for cruelty. The
Werner divorce proceedings were com

desrtlon. but the decree was awarded
Mrs. Werner on her cross-complaint.
Suits for divorce were filed by John F.
Madden against Edith Madden for infidel
ity and Bertha I. Jones against Richard
M. Jones for desertion.
A suit for divorce was filed by Dr. Ed
win Bunnell, police surgeon, against Mary
R. Bunnell. He charges desertion. They
were married in Oakland June 13, 1S95,
and' have three children. The alleged de
sertion occurred April 12, 1902.
The marriage of Charlotte E. Hooper to
Charles I* Hooper was annulled by Judge
Troutt yesterday on complaint of the first
named. It was shown that at the time
the marriage took place she was under
age and had not secured the consent of
her parents.
Mrs. Wilkerson says that her husband
is possessed of property worth $3000. She
asks for a division thereof and such
monthly alimony as the court thinks is
meet and just.
The long expected and much talked of
divorce proceedings, which according to
rumor Maucfe Amber, the leading lady at
Fischer's Theater, would institute against
Ira Puerl Wllkerson, former stage man
ager at Fischer's, were instituted yester
day. The chief feature of the complaint
is the entire lack of sensational charges,
with which rumor had it the document
would fairly reek, though, to be sure.
Miss Amber, whose real name Is Amber
Wllkerson, charges that Puerl has been a
real naughty man and has since October,
1302, lavished his affections upon numer
ous Jane Does in several townsâ In Seat
tle, Wash., and in our own fair State. She
also charges that he has treated her
cruelly.
The complaint starts â¢ off with the re
cital that the Wllkersons were "from Mls
sourL" They were married at Kansas
City, In that State, thirteen years ago.
Whether their married life was happy un
til last October Is not stated, there being
no mention of any infelicities occurring
during that time. Last October, however,
alleges Mrs. Wllkerson, Puerl transferred
his affections from her to one Jane Doe
at Ellensburg, Wash. A month later, she
says, he fell a victim to the charms of a
second Jane Doe, located at Spokane. At
Seattle he met with another dear, also
bearing the euphonious name of .Doe, and
upon his arrival in this city last January
continued lavishing his affections upon
others of the Doe family.
It was in January of this year, accord
ing to the complaint, that the alleged acts
of cruelty occurred. The fair plaintiff al
leges that on the night of January 7 he
made threats to do her bodily harm, tell
ing her that "If she did not meet him
after the show he would beat her to death
on the street."
"Not a cent," was the courteous reply
of the clerk, who turned the hotel register
around so that the. man . from Pittsburg
might inscribe his name, and having per
formed this formality Thaw and his sec
retary meandered out among the throng
of other passengers who had arrived
earlier from the south to attend the fight
and had experienced the same disap
pointment at the Palace.
The marriage some months ago of Miss
Thaw to the Earl of Yarmouth was given
special notoriety by reason of the fact
that her brother, who is now here, for
reasons which he has refused to explain
declined to attend the ceremony.
Going to the Palace Hotel he was again
confronted with difficulties, for the man
agement was unable to furnish him with
a room, notwithstanding his offer to pay
a handsome bonus for a place to sleep.
"Well, you don't charge anything for
registering," remarked the young man.
showing signs of chagrin at his misfor
tune..
William Thaw, the son of one of Pitta
burg's millionaire residents and a brother
of Lady Yarmouth, arrived In this city
