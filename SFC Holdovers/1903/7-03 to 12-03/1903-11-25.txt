PILING ON INDEBTEDNESS.
There was filed yesterday for record
a document that has led many local
financiers, and especially those inter
ested in the welfare of the Southern
Pacific Company, to strongly suspect
that the Harriman syndicate is quietly
planning an absorption of the South
ern Pacific Railroad companies, the
Central Pacific Railroad and their
many small tributaries into the Ken
tucky corporation of which he is the
directing power. That the railroad
magnate i3 in a position to carry out
such a scheme no one acquainted with
the conditions that make him an Im
portant factor in Wall street will deny,
and that he has long cherished such
an undertaking is well known in the
higher circles of the railroad world.
To place those roads in a state of
bankruptcy and eventually deliver
them to the Southern Pacific Company
of Kentucky would be a trick that
would necessitate the employment of
the same brains that are now employed
in the management of the combined
systems, and to fully realize an ambi
tion of this magnitude would only be in
keeping with the desperate struggle
now in progress among the big manip
ulators of the East to gain a firmer
grasp on the gigantic railroad holdings
of this country.

According to the captain's statement
the vessel was in her regular course

as soon as the scow was reported he

her helm "too readily or the captain

In the dense fog that prevailed; over
the bay last night the ferry-boat Sausa
lito of the North Shore Company ran
on the beach at Point Knox oh ..the
western shore of Angel Island. ,
No fatalities attended the disaster and
good fortune once again hovered -over
the passengers that risked their lives in
crossing the dark waters of the bay.
The Sausalito was in charce of Cap
tain J. C. Lucky, and his explanation
of the wreck, piven last nicht. was that
he was on his regular course, bound
from San Francisco to Sausalito. leav
ing this side at 8:48 p m.
While off the shore of AnÂ«l Island
the look-out of the Sausalito reported a
scow anchored ahead. Captain Lucky,
claims that he tried to swing the ferry
boat between the scow and the shore,
but that his. vessel answered her helm
very quickly and in an instant the Sau-
salito had run on to theisandv beach of
the island and then poked her- nose
against the rocky cliff. C
To the credit: of the passengers., there
was not a single siÂ«n of panic when it
became known that the Sausalito "was
ashore. The ferry-boat slid on to the
beach with an easy, Rlidins: motion and
poked her bow hijrh and dry ' 'against
the rocks of 'the island.
The whistles of {he Sausalito, at

An investigation revealed the fact
that the schooners had no fixed price
for carrying these passengers, but
_*iuld agree to carry them at all kinds
< f figures. The greater part of the new,
but rapidly developing business was
mainly acquired by commission through
local "scalping" agencies, who, for the
purpose of catching the unwary trav
eler, had the fronts of their offices em
blazoned with b'.g s!grs announcing cut
rates to coast points. The Pacific Coast
company finally figured that.lt was los
ing between 5250,000 and 5300,000 a year
by th;s dangerous competition and
Fteps were at once taken to force the
schooner owners out of the passenger
business. " JU ".' -
Two weeks ago J. C. Ford, vice presi
dent and general manager of the Pa
cific Coast company, accompanied by
\V. E. Pearce. manager of tbe Pacific
Coast Steamship Company, and C. D.
Dunann, general passenger agent of
the same company, made a hurried trip
to Southern California. Two days
later, as was announced in The Call's
dispatches, they had formulated plans
for a bitter fight against the lumber
schooner owners.
They made public their intention of
inaugurating a service of lumber
schooners between the nprthern and ;
southern ports and of establishing lum
ber yards . in San Diego, Los Angeles,
Ganta Barbara, Pasadena and San
Pedro, with the latter place as the gen
eral distributing point and then cut the
Prevailing prices of lumber to a point
that would keenly affect the milling
companies which have been operating
their own schooners and dabbling in
Angeles, where with ft number of prom
inent^ lumbermen of this city and the
soutfr the existing condition of affairs
was secretly discussed and plans sug
gested for preventing the Pacific Coast
Company from carrying out its threat
to enter into the lumber trade on the
coast and cut rates at all the ports
within the local territory.
The trouble dates back several
months, when the Pacific Coast Com
pany, which controls the Pacific Coast
Pteamship Company, discovered that a
large number of the lumber companies
operating schooners between coast
ports ostensibly for the carrying of the
product from their respective mills had
lately enterec- into the passenger traf
fic business and were getting a large
share of the second-class business be
tween the Sound ports and San Pedro.

death became a citizen of California and
his will was drawn there. By his will
nearly the whole of the estate was left
to the Baptist Orphans' Home of this
city. The point was raised that thÂ«
California law prohibited the distribu
tion of more than one-third of a testa
tor's estate among charitable Institu
tions. The attorney for the Baptist Or
phans' Home admitted at the confer
ence to-day that the California statute
governed. The orphans' home will ac
cordingly receive but $120,000. Instead of
$400,000, as the will devised. The re
mainder will be divided among Captain
Norton's next of kin.

ESTATE TO BE DIVIDED
BY CALIFORNIA LAW
Alluding to Mr. Chamberlain's charge
that he (the Duke) was a "drag on the
wheels of progress," the speaker said
he was content to act as a drag on the
engine which was running down grade
against all signals.
Lord Goschen moved, and Lord Ham
ilton seconded, the following resolu
tion, which was passed by an over
whelming vote:
"This meeting, while prepared to con
sider in a friendly spirit any measure
the Government may submit to Parlia
ment in special cases for mitigating
the effects of hostile tariffs, Is of the
opinion that strenuous opposition
should be offered to any fiscal policy
involving the protective taxation of
food and the establishment of a gen
eral preferential or protective system."
The Duke of Devonshire said he was
prepared to prove that Mr. Chamber
lain's Glasgow budget would entail a
tremendous loss to the consumer, while
the workingman's expenses would be
increased 10 per cent. He believed that
there could be no greater fallacy that
from the prohibition or restriction of
imports from abroad would increase
the profitable employment of capital
and labor at home. The country was
prospering everywhere, yet Mr. Cham
berlain asserted that only stagnation
existed. #
He was epposed to the ] taxation of
food because he thought that sueh tax
ation was the keynote of the entire
policy to which he took exception.
Should the price of food be raised some
compensation must be given to the
workingmen., He recognized the great
service of Joseph Chamberlain, but
even the great services of the pa3t
should not blind any one to an acute
consideration of the result and signi
ficance of the former Colonial Secre
tary's fiscal scheme. In his budget Mr.
Chamberlain apparently had not con
sidered the increased cost of living for
the workingman.
Referring to the speeches of Premier
Balfour, the Duke of Devonshire said
that they did not indicate the objective
policy of. the Government. Had he
been assured that a moderate use of
the proposed power of retaliation would
be made by the Premier, he still might
be a member of the Government.
Continuing, the speaker said that
while the fiscal policy was not yet a
party question, there was nothing
which the advocates of the scheme,
which emanated from the brain of a
single eminent statesman, would like
better than a general election which
would turn on this question alone.
I This reference to Joseph Chamberlain
was greeted with mingled cheers and
hisses.
â¢v The Duke said the meeting was one
cVf Unionists desiring to urge on thÂ»Â»
Government the danger of taking a
certain course and the expediency of
resisting a certain course. It was not
the policy of the Unionist Government
which was before the country. The
public liked a clear issue, and such an
issue had been placed before them by
Mr. Chamberlain, who left the Govern
ment in order that he might be freo.
Cheers and hisses again followed this
mention of Mr. Chamberlain.
LONDON, Nov. 24.â The Duke of
Devonshire presided and was the prin
cipal speaker at a great demonstration
in Queen's Hall her,p to-night under
the auspices of the Free Food League.
It was the Duke's first public speech
since his resignation as Lord President
of the Council and the first really im
portant meeting of the free fooders aj
an offset to the active propaganda of
the Tariff Reform League. The hall
was packed and the prominent person
ages present were the Duchess of Dev
onshire. Lord Balfour of Burleigh,
Charles T. Richie, Sir Michael Hicks-
Beach, Lord Goschen, Winston Spen
cer Churchill, Lord Hugh Cecil, Lord
Robert Cecil, Lord Lytton and a num
ber of leading members of the House
of Com mobs.
The Duke of Devonshire outlined the
object of the constitution of the Free
Food League, which he pointed out was
formed a few months before the Gov
ernment's declaration of its fiscal pol
icy and therefore could not have been
formed for any purpose of hostility to
the Government. The name of the
league indicated the purpose thereof.
There might be differences of opinion
concerning the extent to which retalia
tion might legitimately go. Some mem
bers of the league were not altogether
opposed to some form of protection,
but they were all united and prepared
to resist to the utmost the imposition
of any protective taxation on food or
protective duties generally. He himself
claimed the right to oppose anything in
the nature of a return to protection.
Prolonged cheering followed this
statement of the Duke.
NEW YORK, Nov. 24.â Testimony of
a sensational nature was introduced in
the United States shipbuilding hearing,
which was resumed to-day. During the
course of his redirect examination of
Lewis Nixon, president of the ship
building company, Untermyer, counsel
for the complainants, brought out from
Nixon the statement that of the $5,000,
000 additional stock issued when the
company was reorganized to take in
the Bethlehem company, $1,000,000 went
to Max Pam, Schwab's counsel, and
$1,000,000 each to Nixon, Dresser and
the Trust Company of the Republic,
leaving $1,000,000 the disposition of
which he did not know. He did not
know whether Schwab obtained it.
It was also brought out that at the
time the Sheldon reorganization plan
was under consideration Schwab of
fered to purchase $100,000 bonds, with
the accompanying bonus of 25,000
shares common and 25,000 shares pre
ferred stock, issued to Nixon, for $90,
000, while the market value was far less
than this.
CHARGES ATTEMPTED BRIBERY.
Untermyer made the direct charge
that this was in the nature of a bribe
to induce Nixon to agree to the Shel
don plan of reorganization, instead of
the plan for an assessment of stock
which he had previously advocated.
The offer was shown in two letters of
Schwab to Joseph H. Hoadley, dated
May 26, 1903, copies of which were in
troduced in evidence. Hoadley, it was
testified, had conducted the negotia
tions with Schwab' when Nixon was
endeavoring to persuade Schwab to ac
cede to the assessment plan and had,
after the proposal, urged Nixon to ac
cede to the Sheldon plan. Nixon said
that at Hoadley's request he had done
so.
"I think the testimony to-day shows
clearly that there has been no settle
ment," said Untermyer during the re
cess. 'Â¦
* At the conclusion Nixon gave out for
publication a letter he had received
from Hoadley in answer to Nixon's
request for copies of the correspond
ence between Schwab and Hoadley.
Lewis Nixon was the first witness to
day. His redirect examination was
conducted by Samuel Untermyer, coun
sel for the bondholders. Untermyer
again took Nixon over the affairs of
the Bethlehem Steel Company and its
connection with the shipbuilding com
pany. Nixon declared himself ignorant
of affairs of the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany before its acquisition by the ship
building company, having made no in
vestigation thereof and having relied
upon the reports of the accountants.
For matters sir.ee that time he gener
ally referred Untermyer to the min
utes of the meetings, declining to tes
tify to matters of record, and in regard
to the listing of the shipbuilding se
curities he adhered to his previous at
titudeâthat he had left this to Judge !
Gary and Pam, who, he said, had com
plete charge.
In this connection Untermyer em
barked on a long course of question
ing about the relation of the shipbuild
ing company and the constituent com
panies when Ahe several plants and
their assets had been leased "back to
the constituent companies under these
circumstances. Nixon said he was un
able to speak with authority on so com
plicated a point of law, especially as
he had no opportunity to consult the
leases. The leases were sent for.
SCHWAB'S LETTERS PRODUCED.
Nixon was then caused to relate the
steps he took in opposition to the Shel
don reorganization, when an assess
ment on the stock of the shipbuilding
company was suggested to him by Jo
seph H. Hoadley, and he and Hoad
ley endeavored to persuade- Schwab to
consent. to this plan. During this re
lation Nixon described 'himself as "an
amateur in the business," and then
Guthrle objected to the whole state
ment- ITntermyer said he had no ob
jection to' striking out Nixon's refer
ence to amateurism'.
Untermyer offered in evidence two
letters from Charles M. Schwab to
Hjiadley,. offering to purchase certain
etocks and bonds of the -shipbuilding
company. Nixon I admitted 1 , that the
stocks and bonds referred to were
those given him at the formation gf the
company, in case the Sheldon reorgani
zation plan were ' agreed to.
immediately objected to these letters,
but Untermyer declared them relevant,
as showing that "Mr. Schwab bribed,
or attempted to bribe, the president of
the shipbuilding company to agree to
a plan of reorganization to which he
had, previously objected.".
Untermyer thrice repeated this state
ment' about attempted bribery and fin
ally secured the admission, of one of
the 'letters, the. authenticity of the
other, a copy,", being unproved. " The
letter was as follows:
NEW YORK, May 26. 1903. â Joseph II.
Hoadley,- -New York City,- N. Y. â Dear
Sir: Providing the United States Ship
building reorganization is perfected, I
hereby guarantee to take and pay for
$100,000 of flrsn. mortgage .bonds of the
United States Shipbuilding ' Company,
25.000 shares-rof preferred and 25.000
shares of common stock, for.- the sum of
J9(K000, plus Interest on said bonds, on
or oefore December 1. 1903. Said bonds
and stocks to be deposited with Messrs.
Mclntyn? & Marshall, 74:Broadway, New
York, and to be exchanged for securities
of tho reorganized company, as designat
ed by agreement issued by the reorgani
zation committee: â¢> Very truly yours
CM. SCHWAB.
The second letter, wjiich was later
admitted as "evidence, is as follows:

Nearly 1000 people are affected by the
mistakes and there appears no way of
remedying them, as the Supervisors,
depending upon the Assessor's figurrs,
have made appropriations of money
covering the total income. A number of
lively suits are expected to result.
Another peculiar thing is that the
Methodist Episcopal church, supposed
to be free from taxation, was assessed
for $7500. The First National Bank was
compelled to pay taxes on a quarter of
a section of land, which, according to
the Assessor's figures, contained 560
acres.
FRESNO, Nov. 24.â Protests from
taxpayers are coming in to the Super
visors in great nulobers on account of
numerous clerical errors made .in the
oflce of Assessor George W. Cameron.
The protests so far have been of little
avail, and in most cases the property
owners have paid the taxes under
promises of a rebate.
Most of the errors were due to igno
rance on .the part of the clerks in the
Assessor's ofnce. In setting down the
amounts they Invariably put two ci
phers after the sum of dollars. On the
assessment list there is no column for
the cents and consequently the sums
are read as dollars. In one instance
Mrs. Rosetta Hines, who should have
been assessed for J10 worth of personal
property, was assessed for 51000 worth.
13. F. Smith of Clovis, who possessed
$t>5 worth of personal property, was
compelled to pay taxes on over $0000
worth. Supervisor Burleigh himself
was assessed for office fixtures valued
at $725. His protest is that he has iio

NEW YORK. Nov. 24.â A burglar
may go too far, even in Brooklyn,
when he steals a cuckoo clock in oper
ation from the home *f a sleuth. That
is what one tried to do last night. John
Baldwin is his name on the police
records. Detective Joe Price lives at
162 Washington Park. He is a plain
clothes sleuth in Captain Miles O'Reil
ly's precinct and works nights.
Baldwin got into the Price flat by
forcing the hall door and selected a
lot of silverware to carry away. The 1
silver was in a grip. Baldwin had one
free hand and, being thrifty, picked a
Swiss clock off a nail on the dining
room wall and hugged it up against
him as he got ready to go.
Just then it became the duty of the
cuckoo to tell the hour of midnight and
it started in. Baldwin tried to get rid
of the clock, but he could not. The
carved ends of the wooden bird's wings
caught in Baldwin's coat collar. Not
only could he not lose the clock, but
his coat refused to come off and the
more he struggled the harder the
cuckoo cuckooed. The noise awakened
the detective's son William. He ran
out only to see the thief flying down
stairs two steps at a time and every
Jump jarred another cuckoo out of the
cuckoo bird. Price caught the burglar
after a chase of two blocks. He was
held for trial.

writes:- "I spent the summer of 1902 at

to die, but by accident heard of your
Compound. This last summer I went
back to the springs and found him much
improved and on the road to recovery.
This man and his case induced me to
Ftart on your Compound."

Any honest person who suffers from Rheu-

alter my course each time in order to
clear them. We were going about half
speed when the lookout reported a scow
ahead. The fog was very dense
and by the time I could make her
out we were on top of her. I put mv
helm hard to port and swung her
around just in time to miss the scow's
stern, which was pointed toward us. I
guess my vessel answered her helm too
quickly, for before we knew it we were
aground. I have navigated this bay as
long as any captain in the service and I
guess have had as few accidents."
Mr. Rank, manager of the North
Shore Company, was aboard the Sau
salito shortly after the accident and is
of the opinion that it was due entirely to
the fog, which was extremely dense.
Those of the passengers that were in
a position to judge the accident believe
that it was due entirely to the foz and
that the captain was out of his course.
No one was injured and it is thought
that the damage done to the vessel is
slight.
HOLE IN STEAMER'S HOLD.
There is undoubtedly a hole stove in
the forward end of the steamer, and a
thorough investigation will be made be
fore any 'attempt is made to float the
vessel.
Miss Farrell of San Rafael, who
was a passenger on the Sausalito, said:
"We left San Francisco at 8:45 for
Sausalito. The night was very foggy
and most of the passengers were inside.
I was seated in the upper cabin read
ing a book. I thought we were near
our destination, when suddenly I felt
a slight sensation as if the boat was
on the sand and an instant after it
came to a sudden halt and the passen
gers ran to the bo,w of the boat. I was
not afraid and the rest of the passen
gers appeared cool. We immediately
saw that we were on the beach. In
front of us was a rocky cliff and we
felt that the boat could not sink. The
captain immediately notified us that
everything was all right and that re
lief would be summoned and we would
be sent to Sausallto. I was surprised
how cool we all were. I suppose it
was because the boat went ashore so
lightly."
C. Cohen relates the following story:
"I was seated inside the lower deck at
rived in time to help them out of their
difficulty, however, and in a very short
time had all of the passengers on board
the Cazadero. As the thirtv-odd pas
sengers climbed aboard the laree steam
er they gave three lusty cheers for The
Call and a vote of thanks for its timelv
aid.
C. J. Lucky, captain oi the Sausa-
Hto, gives the following explanation of
the accident:
"There were three or four small
scows anchored in my wav between San
Francisco and Point Knox. I had to
ashore. *
Captain Lucky reported last nighi
that the Sausalito was leaking slightlv
forward, but not sufficient to endancer
the vessel. Collision mats prevented
the inflow of water from reaching the
fire and engine rooms.
"A steam launch used by Call men
brought a big bunch over to our boat
and everybody cheered the newspaper
men. From what I could gee there was
no panic or fear shown by the passen
gers. It was very calm and the fog
was not as thick as when we started."
When the Cazadero reached this city
it took on those who were waiting to
go to Sausalito. As soon as It3 new
cargo of precious burdens wertÂ» taken
aboard the steamer started through the
fog for distant Sausallto. The Caza
dero has orders %o return and stand by
the Sausalito and at high tide will use
her powerful engines in pulling the
Sausalito off the beach.
After landing the wrecked oassenccrs
the Cazadero returned to San Francisco
for the passengers that had waited for
hours to return to their homes across
the bay.
She passed close to the Sausalito
and Captain Lucky reported that his
vessel had not shifted and that there
was no danger of her being further dam
aged unless a storm blew up. The cap
tain and his crew remained on the
wrecked ferry-boat and will stav with
her until she is pulled off or hopelessly
wrecked.
The Cazadero left this side at i:.^o
o'clock this morning, taking nearly sev
enty passengers for Sausalito. Captain
Matheas of the Cazadero stated before
he left that an attempt would be made
at high water this mornine to Dull the
Sausalito from the spot where she went
"Jack" Ferry and Sam Kalisky re
turned to this city 'on the Cazadero.
They had been over to Gardner's train
ing quarters at Larkspur and had start
ed for San Francisco after 8 o'clock.
Kalisky said it was very foggy on the
bay and the Cazadero'3 whistle kept
blowing all the way. "When near An
gel Island the Sausalito's whistles were
heard signaling for help," said Kalis
ky, "and the Cazadero went as near the
unfortunate steamer as was possible.
The passengers were in no danger. A
small rowboat brought passengers to
the Cazadero and they were glad to get
out of danger.
DISTRESS WHISTLES BLOW.
the time the Sausallto went ashore. At
first there was a light grinding below
as the boat scraped the bottom and In
an instant it came to a sudden halt.
The passengers immediately ran to the
front of the boat and noticed that there
was no immediate danger, as we could
get ashore. The captain notified the
passengers that everything was safe.

DENVER, Nov. 24.â A special to the
News from Cripple Creek says the Cor
oner's inquest in the case of two
men killed by the explosion in the Vin
dicator mine was begun to-day. The
evidence produced demonstrated con
clusively that the explosion was the re
sult of a plot to blow up the mine, but
nothing of a definite nature developed
to indicate the guilty persons,
j The articles found at the scene of the
explosion were put In evidence. They
consisted of Dart of a stick of giant
powder of a different make from that
used by Vindicator miners, some elec
tric wire and fragments of a Colt's 32
caliber revolver.
Several witnesses were examined, but
no newfacts were brought out. At 6:30
o'clock the inquest, was adjourned until
2 o'clock Friday afternoon.
This afternoon Adjutant General
Sherman Bell, whorls in Denver, stated
that a laree amount of evidence had
been secured for the trial of the men
suspected of the outrage. A telegram
.was received to-day from the manufac-
Evidence Shows Vindicator Mine Ex

CORONER'S INQUEST BEGINS.
The calling out of the militia was a
step I was extremely loth to take, and
I only decided to do so after- full investi
gation. A large number of miners aro
perfectly satisfied with their wages and
?heir hours, but the strikers, led by so
called organizers, won't let them alone,
but are threatening them with bodily
harm if they continue at work. I have
been informed of instances of personal
violence and threats to kill and burn per-
Eons and property. We were foremost in
the West to legalize the eight-day hour
in Utah, and instead of being applauded
and assisted and respected for it, these
agitators are seeking to punish us for it.
It won't do. As long as I am Governor
I shall resist the tyrannical and unlaw
ful interference of individuals or unions
with the peaceful pursuits of the citi
zens of this State.
We are not to be jeered at nor sneered
at. and we don't propose to stand for
anything of that kind. You are expected
to be firm in purpose and quick In action
in quelling any disorders or violations of
the law. Soldiers on their beats are cau
tioned to submit to no insults or intimi
dation. We propose to see that this uni
form is respected, and any soldier who
allows It to be insulted is unfit for duty.
Concerning the strike situation and
the necessity for calling out troops,
Governor Wells said to-day:

San Francisco came north with the
party.
How many of the soldiers were killed
Fleming does not know, because every
effort was made by the Mexican au
thorities to keep the matter secret.
The company of troops which was
routed was escorting a wagron train
containing supplies for a mining camp
near the head of the Yaqui River. The
attack was made after nightfall in a
narrow ravine, after the soldiers had
pone into camp without placing: pick
ets on guard. It being: supposed by
them that they were beyond the zone
of Yaqui trouble.
Fleming declares that there is noth

often sent out from over the border
to the effect that there was no Indian
outbreaks in Sonera. Two of Flem

dead from ambush in an attack made
by the Indians during the trip from
Ortiz to Cumlripa. on the Yaqui River.
A week before the fight at Rapairo
a ba:;<i of Indians captured a caravan
that was freighting to the mines of La
Dura district on the same road which
his party traveled. They stripped their
Mexican prisoners and turned them
loose in the wilderness to wander back
as best they might, without food or
water.
He says that the attack took place
near where the Fleming party was
camped. A band of fifty Indians sur
prised a company of soK.iers in camp,
and after a sharr> fight in the dark
ness scattered the entire command. At
the time of Fleming's departure only
six of the entire company had been ac
counted for, and these were found dead.
The rest had fallen into the hands of
the natives or been driven into hiding
in the reugh mountain country. The
company was under the command of
Colonel Francisco Picardo of the Fifth

The only Important concession made
by the company was an agreement to
reinstate all of the strikers, including
the outside unions who went out in
sympathy with the trainmen, with the
exception of those who resorted to vio
lence during the trouble.
The arbitration of the wage scale is
to be according to the wages paid out
side of Chicago and not on the basis of
the local street railways. These are the
two points that have been the stum
bling block to a peaceable adjustment
of the strike for the past week. The
company has insisted that it pays high
er wages than any similar corporation
in the country. The men were fearful
that the arbitration on the scale paid in
other cities would decrease their wages
and they fought stubbornly for that

BIO DEBATING MEETING
According to the arguments offered
at the California Club yesterday the
consensus of opinion seems to be
against the problem play. The ques
tion of debate was. "Resolved. That
the problem play is beneficial to the
playgoer." The question was brilliant
ly represented on both sides. Speaking
for the affirmative were Miss Mary
Fairbrother. Mrs. Horace Coffin, Ma
dame Emella Tojetti and Miss Cron
dace. On the negative side of the argu
ment were Mrs. J. W. Orr. Mrs. Fred
erick Handen, Mrs. Frederick Baker
and Mrs. C. Mason Klnne.
When the vote was taken the result
showed 32 votes for the affirmative and
40 for the negative. Now this is net
meant to prove that the problem play
is doomed, so far as the California
Club is concernedâ far be it from tMs.
The result of the .voting was entirely
on the merits of the arguments offered
and not on the merits of the problem
play itself. A feature of the entertain
ment was the recitation of "The
Chariot Race" by Mr. Kelly of the Ben-
Hur company. Mrs. Frank P. Deering
presided, with charming grace and dig
nity. Altogether the meeting was ore

According to the complaint Emmel
died intestate November 1. 1900. The
following day Mrs. McDonald, under
the name of Burke, applied for and se
cured letters of administration upon
his estate. In the following February,
representing that she was the only heir,
she asked that the estate be distributed
to her and her petition was granted.
Mrs. O'Connor says she was not noti
fied of the proceedings and therefore
could not take any steps to prevent tho
alleged fraud upon the court. She says
that since her sister secured possession
of the property she has collected rents
amounting to '$704, and she asks for
judgment for half of that sum and to
be declared an owner of a onÂ«-half in
terest in the realty.
In a complaint to set aside a decree
of distribution in the estate of Conrad
Emmel, filed yesterday by Mrs. Lillla
O'Connor (nee Emmel), she makes
serious charges against her sister,
Amelia McDonald, administratrix ot
the estate. Mrs. O'Connor accuses her
sister of deceiving the court and by
representing that she was the sole heir
of Emmel. securing distribution to her
of his entire estate, which consisted of
a lot with improvements on Clara
street, near Fifth.

CHARGES SISTER WITH
DECEIVING THE COUET
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 24.âInvestiga
tion to-day by the authorities of the.
story told by the captain of the Ger
man ship Octavia, which arrived yes
terday, to the effect that three mem
bers of her crew had been poisoned. by
the sailmaker out of revenge disclosed
the fact that the captain, while he may
have believed the story, magnified the
truth. He still asserts that he believes
that the sailmaker was responsible for
the death of the three seamen who
were burled at sea three weeks ago,
but when asked for his evidence, he
could produce none.
Inquiry among members of the
crew showed that the poisoning of
three sailors and the first officer was
an accidental result 'of a drunken ca
rousal, in which many members of the
crew participated. The part that the
sailmaker had in it was that he discov
ered where the men could obtain whis
ky and piloted a number of them into
the hold. They became intoxicated and
while In that condition three of them
got into a portion of the cargo contain-,
ing carbolic acid and, mistaking it for
whisky, they swallowed the poison and
died. The first officer took only a small
portion of the acid, not sufficient to kill
him, but still sufficient" to make him a
very sick man, and he is still far from
well. The Federal authorities here are
now satisfied that the only punishment
which can be meted out to the sail
maker is such as may be imposed fgr
breaking into the cargo and violating
orders.

RESULT OF ACCIDENT
BERLIN. Nov. 24.â The frivolous
game of "My Aunt and Your Aunt," a
simplification of baccarat, with the
Minister of Justice occasionally keeping
the bank, has corrupted society at Ol
denburg, capital of the Grand Ducky
of Oldenburg, according to testimony in
a libel suit brought by the minister
against a schoolmaster. Dr. Rios, who
disclosed the extent of the gambling.
The testimony proved that nearly all
the judges and the State's Attorney of
Oldenburg had during fifteen to twenty
v'ears been zealous devotees of the
goddess of chance; that the stakes
reached as h!j?h as ?25O and that the
players often borrowed money, even
from visitors.

Sir John for a long time had been
suffering from Bright's disease and
heart trouble. The deceased Baronet
was a typical figure in this busy age.
He was with equal success a business
man, race horse owner, country squire
and member of Parliament. At the age
of 16 years he commenced business in
his father's small furniture shop, which
gradually developed into . its present
huge proportions. His title was a re
ward for political services to the-Un
ionists. Hardly an election has been
held In the metropolis for .many years
without Sir- John personally driving
voters to the polls in a four-horse
coach. His exposure of the remount
scandals In the South African war was
one of the earliest movements toward
the reform of the War Office. Few men
played a more promirient" part in the
racing world than Sir John Maple in
the last two decades. He headed the
list of winning owners in 1902 and had
the largest racing stud in the United
Kingdom, but the aristocratic Jockey
club persistently denied him admit
tance, presumably on account of his
connection with business, until last
September, when It was already known
that his illness must be .fatal.
Sir John gave large' sums in benefac
tions, notably $600,000 to the University
College Hospital. His only child is the
wife of Baron von Eckhardsteln, first
secretary of the German embassy in
London.

teen miners were killed and great dam
age was done by an accidental explo
sion of gas to-day in coal mine No. 20
at Bonanza, Ark., twenty miles from
this city. At nightfall only six of the
victims had been recovered.
The explosion occurred at 1 o'clock
this afternoon: There were about 175
men in the various shafts at the time.
All escaped without injury except thir
teen. The force of the explosion was
terrific and timbers were torn from the
walls' of the passages for several hun
dred yards.' The passages were so com
pletely obstructed that the work of res
cuing the entombed men was tedious
in the extreme and several hours were
consumed before- the first body was
found. . ...... _,
It is thought that the gas was acci
dentally Ignited by a miner's lamp.

The condition In the affairs of the !
locked-out . cloakmakers has not â¢
changed and from the present outlook '
there does not seem to be the slightest j
chance of the employers acceding to j
the demands of their late employes.
The employers consider that it is un
fair that their help should elect to de
sert them on a Saturday afternoon at
4 o'clock, an hour they submit when
many customers come to their stores
to have their garments fitted. The
employers claim that it wouid be im- j
possible to have alterations made for |
purchasing customers if all the girls j
leave work Saturday arternoons at the >
time specified In the demands. It is I
said that th^ firms affected have com- !
blned with the object of resisting the!
demand. :
A demand for a raise of 20 per cent
on their wages is to be made by em
ployes of Wells, Fargo & Co. Every
man from the senior messenger to the
stablemen has entered a combination
in making the demand, which is to be
pushed forward by the International
Union of Railway Expressmen. Jan
uary 1 next is the date fixed for the
demand to go into effect.
There is no change in the position of
the paperbox makers, who are out on
strike, and there seems little likelihood
of the employers acceding to the de
mands made upon them.
The contemplated consolidation of all
the laundries. of the city has caused a
good deal of uneasiness in the Laundry

feel that there is likely to be trouble

there will be no more trouble or oppo

As to Berkeley, where the competi
tion with the new system is keenest,
the company will attempt to further
reduce the time by putting on more
more morning and evening flyers. It la
possible that twelve' minutes will be
cut off the present schedule* by these
trains and the time-saving devices at
the mole, thus reducing the time of the
trip to within five minutes of the new
system's schedule. New cars, opening
on the side instead of at the end, like
those in use on some Eastern road3.
may be purchased and used exclusively
for ferry traffic.
MORE FLYERS PROMISED.
Of course, it was too early for Man
ager Kruttschnltt to say anything as
to the methods the Southern Pacific
will pursue to meet the competition
and he refused to commit himself when
asked his opinion on the subject. It
may be taken for granted, however,
that the company will formulate some
plan for saving itself from the inroads
of the new system.
It is understood that the old com
pany has already begun to figure on
the means for reducing the time be
tween the east and the west sides of
the bay. Among the principal innova
tions will be a new method to overcome
the time lost on the punching of tickets
at the mole and the handling cf freight
on the boats. The present ticket gates
will probably be abolished, so that pas
sengers may be transferred from the
trains to the boats without having: to
punch tickets at all, an antiquated
method that now consumes much valu
able time. The freight will be diverted
entirely from the passenger boats and
sent across the bay on separate boats,
thus effecting another saving in time.
It is believed that at least ten minutes
in time will be saved by these means.
MAY ABOLISH GATES.
That the officials of the Southern Pa
ciflc Company are worried about the
way the new ferry system la cutting

Cents a Pound.
NEW YORK, Nov. 24.â Turkeys will
be a. luxury to most New York people

selling at 30 cents a pound in the city
markets, or 10 'cents higher than In 1901.
The price of all classes of poultry has
risen steadily this week, even chickens
being almost at a prohibitive figure.
Eggs also have risen so far as prices
are concerned, being quoted at 40 cents
a dozen. Poultry raisers, to take ad
vantage of the scarcity in turkeys, are
killing their chickens to get the big
prices.

The Judge said he desired to hear
argument in the preliminary matter
as to the richt of the defendant to In
quire as to what took place before the
Grand Jury and the attorneys could go
into the issue of the motion afterward.
The point was of the gravest import r
ance and he wanted It fully argued.
Campbell agreed to allow Ach to
make the opening argument and Ach's
associate, Peter F. Dunne, to close.
Ach spoke for two hours and a half
till his voice failed him. He quoted
numerous authorities and decisions in
support of his contention that, the do
ings of the Grand Jury were subject to
review. The argument will be resumed
this morning at 9:30 o'clock.
WANTS POINT ARGUED.
CAMPBELL GIVES WARNING.
Attorney Campbell retorted that he
did not want to talk Just to hear him
self talk and hoped counsel would re
frain from ' indulging In personalities
because he would give him notice that
he was better than a raw hand him
self at that sort of thing and would
give counsel all that he wanted. He
contended there was only one propo
sition and that was, could they con
sider these affidavits under the motion
to get aside the indictment? â¢ Did they
In any way support the motion? He
disclaimed any Intention of sidetrack,
ing the defendant.
The Judge said he wanted to be ad
vised as to how far they could inquire
as to what actually took place before
the Grand Jury. Was not that es
sentially a question of law? , If the pro
ceedings before the Grand Jury were
eacred It was the province of the court
to safeguard Its interests.
When the case of Herman Eppinger
was called Attorney J. C. Campbell,
counsel for the people, renewed his ob
jection to the affidavits filed In support
of the motion to quash the Indictment.
He desired to submit authorities on
the question and said. If his objection
was well taken it* would obviate the
necessity of going into the merits of
the motion. His objection was that. the
affidavits were irrevelant, Immaterial
and did not tend to support the motion.
Attorney Henry Ach objected strong
ly for the defendant to any argument
being made on the objection. made, by
Campbell, as he contended it 1 would be
placing the defendant in a false posi
tion. He wanted the argument on the
motion to be proceeded with. He spoke
In a sarcastic vein.
Counsel for Herman and Jacob Ep
plnger of the bankrupt " firm of Ep
plnger & Co., charged with obtaining
money by false pretenses, are determ
ined that the case shall not go to, trial
without a - struggle. Judgo Lawlor's
time was occupied all yesterday after
noon In listening to the arguments of
counsel on a point as to the defend
ants' right to inquire as to what took
place before the Grand Jury prior to
the finding of the indictments against
the defendants. The Judge wanted that
point decided before hearing the argu
ments on the motion on behalf of Her
man Epplnger to quash the indictment.
The arguments were not concluded
when court adjourned. Both defend
ants were in court, but sat far apart.

Jamea Kavanaugh, a saloon-keeper
at 1SE2 Folso-2; -street, endeavored to re
pair a financial- loss of $2 by beating J.

not argued when the case came before
Judge Cabaniss. The mere fact that It
was used as a weapon instead of a con
diment appeared in the testimony. The

recalled the incident of the 52 owed

press on tbÂ« court the Immensity of the
Joke that was played on the old man,
but Judge Fritz developed an unac
countable lack of humorous sense in
this particular case. While there was
really no charge upon which to punish
the (â¢ fendant. the- Judge made it clear
to him and his fellows that an old man
gaining a living was not a legitimate
object of torment. Whenever Patrick
Doyle is bothered again he will find full
solace in Judg'/ Fritz's court.

by Judge Mogan. He Is venerable in

were horrified to think that their re

fireside to get drunk in a saloon and
others assured the proprietors that for
years and years their parental progeni

the saloon-keepers commenced to look

borrowed money when his load was

It is always best t-o get the best re-
sults from our food that some simple
and harmless digestive should be tak-
en after meals to assist- the relaxed di-
gestive organs, and several years'- ex-
perience has proven Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablet's to be^a very safe, pleasant'
and effective digestive and a remedy
which may be taken daily with the
best results. â¢
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can hard-
ly be called a patent, medicine, as they
do not act on the bowels nor any par-
ticular organ, but only on the . food
eaten. They supply what weak stom-
achs-lack, pepsin â¢ diastase, and by
stimulating the gastric glands- in-
crease the natural secretion of hydro-
chloric acid.
People who make a daily* practice of
taking one or two of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets after each meal. are sure to
have perfect digestion, which- means
perfect health.
There is nq danger of forming an In-
jurious habit, as the tablets contain
absolutely nothing but natural diges-
tives; cocaine, morphine and similar
drugs have no place In a stomach med-
icine, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are certainly the best known and most
popular of all,- stomach remedies.
. Ask your druggist- for a .fifty-cent
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
arid after a week's, use note the:. im-
provement In health, appetite and
nervous energy.
As a general rule, meat once a day
is sufficient for all classes of men,
women arid children, and grains, fruit
and vegetables should constitute the
bulk of food eaten.
But many of the most nutritious
foods are difficult of digestion and it is
of no use to advise brain workers to
eat largely of grains and vegetables
where the digestion is too weak to as-
similate them properly.
Nearly every one will admit that as a
nation we eat too much meat and too
Uttle of vegetables and the grains.
For business men, office men and
clerks and, In fact, every one engaged
In sedentary or Indoor occupations,
grains, milk and vegetables are much
more healthful.
Only men engaged in a severe out-
door manual labor can live on a heavy
meat diet and continue in health.

W. Davis, retired, who has just relin

ance of the United States.
"All roads that the President trav-
els," he said, "lead to the Panama ca
nal, but some "of his discreet friends
should caution him not to burn the
bridges behind him."
That war had, he said, deserved the
condemnation of all Christians because
of the brutality of Marroquin's conduct,
and yet, notwithstanding this conduct
was such as would have done discredit
to the bearer of a scalping knife or
to a Mohawk, the United States was
the ally of that leader throughout the
conflict. He referred especially to Mar
roquin's confiscatory decrees, and said
that President Roosevelt must have
known of them.
Hanna challenged ' the statement of
Morgan that President McKinley had
been" favorable to the Nicaragua route.
"I know of my own personal knowl

became known that the Panama Com

IS CONSUL FOR PANAMA.
Ramon Arias Feraud Jr., the newly
appointed Consul of the republic of
Panama, called at the Custom-house
yesterday to meet some of the Federal
officials. A false rumor gained cur-'
"It is practically impossible for Co
lombia to reach us except by landing
troops on our" shores," he said. "With
out the United States, however, we
might not be so successful, for Colom
bia has an excellent army, which is
well drilled and competent. I believe
that we could get ships if there were
any necessity for so doing." The young
men of Panama are going into the
army. There is a . most enthusiastic
feeling on the isthmus. All parties are
now united and I believe that in case
of necessity we could put 10,000 men
into the field. We do not want war;
what we want is peace and prosperity."
"Things are quiet on thei isthmus at
present and are moving smoothly. The
junta, which consists of a governing
board of three, will rule until the na
tional convention meets, which "may be
in about two months, j The constitution
will then be adopted and there will be
a change in the Government. There
will, of course, be a President and a
Cabinet. I cannot tell you .whether
there will be a Vice but
there will be a provision whereby there
will be a substitute In case of resigna
tion or death of the President."
Speaking of the arrival of Colombian
peace delegates, Dr. Arosemena said
they were well received and that the
conference was held on board the

Speaking of general conditions In

Speaking of the report of the Isth

the Panama route, Senator Morgan
characterized that report as the "dyna
mite that has rent in twain the repub
lic of Colombia." He said further that
the report was a desperate adventure.
He declared that if Mr. McKinley had
lived the protocol with Nicaragua and
Costa Rica would have been observed.
"But he is dead," the Senator went
on, "and a.new- Richmond comes upon*
the field, and he seems not to feel the
obligations of good faith when a more
enticing feeling for the unique admin
istration breaks on the vision of this,
ambitious spirit."
: He declared that it was President
Roosevelt's ambition to have all the
glory of constructing the canal for his
own administration.
"Has the President," he asked, "any
excuse for' his failure to carry into ef
fect the agreement with Nicaragua and
Costa Rica; unless it- be resentment
toward Colombia and gratification of

his review of the history of the ef
forts to secure an isthmian canal and
declared that to the President's ambi
tion to secure the credit of a unique
administration must be credited the fa
voritism manifested by him toward the
Panama route! He asserted that Pres

challenged by Hanna, who said he

that Mr. McKinley had urged a" most
careful investigation after he had
learned that the Panama canal prop

MORGAN AND HANNA CLASH.
The foregoing is the gist of a lengthy
statement which will be forwarded to
the British embassy at Washington.
Panama declines responsibility for the '
Colombian debt, oh the ground that
when the greater part of the money
was borrowed Panama was not in
cluded in Colombia, the facts appear
to be as follows: Panama declared its
Independence of Spain on November 28,
1821, and In. the solemn declaration of
the revolutionary junta stated; 'That
the territory of the isthmus belonged
to the republican state of Colombia,
to the Congress whereof It would, in
due course, send its deputy.* The war
with Spain continued for eome time
thereafter, and in 1822 Colombia Issued
an external loan of $10,000,000, the
greater part of which was to be devoted
to prosecuting the war of independence.
In 1824 Colombia issued a further loan
of $23,750,000 for the same puroose. It
would be surprising if Panama at
tempted to repudiate responsibility for
the money which assisted her to become
part of a free state." v -

because of his interest in the Panama

of his commission, and that Is what
the present executive is doing: so there

Morgan replied that he had spoken
only from the public record of Presi

of his private views.
"I know," he said, "that he entered
into compacts with Nicaragua and
Costa Rica to secure the Nicaragua
route, and there is nc record to show
that he changed his mind."

McKinley preferred Nicaragua. I know

he and Mrs. Wade were married in Jan

BOGOTA, Nov. 21, via . Colon, Nov
24. â A prominent politician here, who
is loyal to the Government and thor
oughly posted in the affairs of the ad
ministration, to-day characterized the
actions of the United States on the
isthmus of Panama as most unjusti
fiable. He added:
Colombians hope that the reasonable
and fair-minded people of the United
States will bring such pressure to bear
on the Government at "Washington that
the result may be the saving of the
isthmus to Colombia, and the protection
of Colombia's unquestioned right there.
All Colombians protest, as would the
people of other nations, against this ag
gression of the United States. Colombia
is' confident that justice will be done her,
and all Colombians are unanimously re
solved to sustain and defend the national
integrity, even at any sacrifice. \ The Bo
gota Government is receiving the sup
port of all political parties, and there are
daily made generous donations of gold
and jewels to meet such expenses as
may become necessary.

its services and property, while the Ger

AMERICANS MAY SUFFER
Still Panama is willing to declare the
debt canceled and even will pay a big
sum of Colombia's debts here for public
services and war exactions, but she must
energetically reject any proposal from
Colombian debt bondholders.
PANAMA, Nov. 24.â There is a dis
position here already to hold fast to the
money that the United States is to pay
for the canal rights and to oppose any
proposition looking to Panama's pay
ment of a proportion of the Colombian
debt, which European powers may in
sist upon In behalf of foreign holders
of Colombian bonds. Should the Pan
amans take this attitude, despite the
pointed suggestion from Washington
that the isthmian Government will be
expected to assume part of the Colom
bian debt, it may embroil the United
States, as protector of Panama, with
European nations.
Referring to the Question of the re
public of Panama paying a part of the
foreign debt of Colombia, the Star and
Herald gives the following data, reck
oned in gold, of sums derived from the
isthmus which were used exclusively
for the benefit of other departments:

extension granted to canal companies,
at least $3,000,000; exemption paid by
railroad for not constructing its line

sums paid by Panama which Colombia
should have paid, and which were
never returned, $1,000,000. The paper

whether the office had received any offi

as Consul at San Francisco. I did not go
there expecting to be recognized in my
new capacity, as I took it that the noti

Information of my appointment yester

be four or n\'e days yet before written
notification will arrive in San Francisco.
I was well received by the Custom-house
officials and one of them told me that
only in urgent Instances was the ap
pointment of such, officers as Consuls

day announcing my appointment as Con

busband and family physician her con
dition went from bad to worse, until
every hope was exhausted.
Mrs. Reuter was 20 years of age, and
with her husband had lived in Mon
terey four years. She was born in Oak
land, but spent nearly all her girlhood
days in San Francisco and Los An
geles. It was in the latter city she met
and married Mr. Reuter. She has rela
tives in both cities, and in Monterey
leaves her husband and 3-year-old
daughter Gladys.
During the early part of the epidemic
Mr. and Mrs. Reuter took a cottage .
high up in the mountains at the Diente,
and lived there without visiting the
city. They were forced to come Into
Monterey one day, and while there Mrs.
Reuter was bitten by a mosquito. She
paid little attention to the insect bite
and returned to the Diente. Three days
later the symptoms of yellow fever
manifested themselves and she was
hurried to Monterey for treatment.

Mrs. Margaret Leech, of 112 William street, says: "I cannot
begin to tell you the different kinds of medicine I have used nor
the quantity I took during the years I have been subject to at-
tacks of backache. Just as I had used many another preparation
in the past when I noticed an advertisement about Doan's Kid-
ney Pills in one of our San Francisco papers I made up my mind
to try the remedy^ It acted just as represented, stopped the back-
ache and pain in the side, and, what is of much more importance
to me, during the last six months I have not had the slightest
; ' indication of a return."
The aches and pains that assail a woman's back when the
kidneys are sick take all the life â all the energy â all the ambi-
tion out of her. Backache makes her tired out and weary, with
nerves unstrung â she must attend to daily duties even though
racking kidney pains make every motion of the body a misery.
Then, too, when the, kidneys are not relieved there is the an-
noyance and danger of urinary disorders. Good health can
only be obtained with Well kidneys. Keep the kidneys well
with the greatcstof modern specifics, Doan's Kidney Pills.
DOAN'S KIDNEY FILLS.
From B. H. Palmer, Windsor, CaL:
"I have been troubled for fifteen years
with piles and have tried different
salves and .ointments, but never came
across anything like your Pyramid Pile
Oure. I used two 50-cent boxes three
months ago. and they have made a
complete cure, and I am recommending
them to every one I know to be afflict-
ed.- Thanks for the cure."
From Thomas A. Nixon, 854 N. Bam-
brey street, Philadelphia: "It is now
time I should let you know that I am
cured of bleeding piles. If you only
knew how I have suffered from them
for the last nine years In pain. Last
April I went to the drug store and
bought a 50-cent box of Pyramid Pile
Cure, and I found ct last a good cure.
I had epent dollars trying to get cured
of my piles; all others have failed to
cure me. but now I am happy to have
a pood sleep and be able to work also!"
Pyramid Pile Cure is sold by drug-
gists generally. If yours doesn't keep
it he will get It for you if , you ask him.

There is only one sure, safe and quick
cure for piles. It is the Pyramid Pile
Cure. It is a recent discovery and its
.properties are such that It cleanses,
soothes and heals the inflamed parts,
reduces the inflammation at once, and
with continued treatment removes all
swelling and all trace of the disease. It
puts the membranes in a healthy, ac-
tive condition and cures completely and
permanently.
From Samuel Victor, Detroit. Mich.:
"I had not written you sooner because
the first box of Pyramid Pile Cure I
used helped me so much, and I wanted
to wait until I was completely cured,
and so it was that after using three
boxes of your Pyramid Pile Cure I am
entirely cured of the terrible disease
from which I have suffered six months;
and r.ow I am using Pyramid Pills,
which helo me very much."
Just a little pain may so distract a
man'r mind that it will cost him hun-
dreds of dollars. Life is a battle. To
succeed one needs all his, energies and
all his brain force to apply to the ques-
tion at hand. Even a corn will make
him Irritable, cross, angryâ and an an-
gry man seldom succeeds. The trifling
pain of a corn is a pleasant feeling be-
side the agonizing ache of piles. That
is a pain which seems to pervade the
whole body. It communicates itself to
all the parts near the seat of the trou-
ble and brings on a heavy, dragging
feeling in the perineum. Those who
have never so suffered do not know
what it means. It racks the nerves,
prevents sleep, prevents concentrated
thought and makes a. man lose flesh as
fast as he would with a virulent fever.
And yet piles are looked upon as a
little thing. They are neglectedâ al-
lowed to run on from month to month
and year to year. By and by comes a
dangerous surgical operation. Maybe
it cures â maybe it kills.

Mrs. A. W. Allen of 139 Rose avenue
and her niece came near dying last
night as a result of taking some bi
chloride of mercury tablets to cure
dyspepsia. Early In the evening the
woman went to a drug store and asked
for some antiseptic tablets. She first
asked for charcoal tablets, then for an
tiseptic tablets, and said that she
wanted them for a case of dyspepsia.
The clerk misunderstood her meaning
and thinking that she wanted an anti
septic wash gave her the bichloride.
She took two tablets and gave her
niece, who was suffering with the same
trouble, one. They Immediately began
to have a "queer feeling, as they term
ed it, and hastened to the Emergency
Hospital. Dr. Armstead pumped the
poison from their stomachs Just In time
and saved them from death. Hereafter,
the women say, they will get their
dyspepsia medicine on a doctor's pre
scription. , -

"With all . the roads of the Southern
Pacific systems under Its absolute con
trol, : the Harriman . syndicate would
create for itself a position in the world
of traffic and finance that could not be
easily attacked by the other ambitious
railroad combines, now struggling for
supremacy' In s , this country.
"The Southern Pacific Company o*
Kentucky has realized the need of ad
ditional equipment with which to op
erate the roads on which it has a lease.
It has gone into the market and pur
chased the necessary material and
loaned it to the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company and the Central Pacific:
Railroad. It has borrowed the money
to pay for the equipment and has given
as security the rolling stock of the
companies. Being a foreign corpora
tion it was necessary that the mortgage
be recorded In the county in which the
main offices of the company are locat
ed and we complied with that require
ment to-day."
In this indebtedness, thrust upon the
leased lines,- shrewd financiers foresee
final' trouble. These roads, about
twenty-three In number, including the
Central Pacific Railroad, Southern Pa
cific Company of California, Southern
Pacific Company of Arizona, Southern
Pacific Company of New Mexico, Hous
ton and Texas, Gait and lone Railroad,
the Sacramento Valley Railroad, Tulare
and Porterville Railroad and numerous
other small branches, together with va
rious other properties, among them the
buildings at Fourth, and Townsend
street/i and lands along the Oakland
estuary, are forced to share the burden
of interest and principal of the debt.
Another loan ostensibly for the bet
terment of the service may follow this
one, and the Interest and cost of wear
and tear will continue to increase upon
the leased roads. Eventually, accord
ing to the views of shrewd men, the
companies will drift into bankruptcy,
as has been the fate of nearly all the
roads in the country except those found
ed and fostered by the late Collls
P. Huntington, and will then, as a last
resort, be merged into the Southern Pa
cific Company of Kentucky as the mea*
ger asset of a once great liability.
years ago.
ATTORNEY FOULDS EXPLAINS.
When asked yesterday concerning the
mortgage. Attorney Foulds stated that
it Was simply to furnish means for
properly operating the roads, and he
added :
filed at the City Hall, and the appear
ance of the document naturally tended
tc strengthen the' theory that Harriman
is maneuvering stealthily toward the
achievement of a plot conceived some
It was shown by these companies
that the competition planned by th*
Pacific Coast Company would ruin
their business on the coast. The repre
sentatives of these lumber concerns
disclaimed any interest In schooners
that are involved in the passenger
traffic along the coast, yet the steam
ship company purposed to enter Into
competition with them. C. A. Hooper
& Co. practically control three of the
largest lumber companies doing busi
ness in Southern California, namely
the Southern California Lumber Com
pany, the L. w. BHnn Lumber Com
pany and. the Russ Lumber and Mill
Company, in which Pope & Talbot are
also interested. F. P. & J. W. Hooper
are at the head of the San Pedro Lum
ber Company, which has its docks and
yards at San Pedro.
These properties have been leased for
years from the Pacific Coast Company,
which now seeks them for the promo
tion of its own lumber business. The
Hoopers, besides their agencies at \Â£he
seaports, have numerous yards along
the lines of the Southern Pacific^ and
Santa Fe lines. In fact, they control
nearly two-thirds of the lumber busi
ness in Southern California, of which
San Pedro, as the general distributing
point, and handles nearly 300,000,000
feet annually.
HARRIMAN TO THE RESCUE.
If these immense lumber interests
It was the railroad company that ar
ranged the secret meeting in Los An
geles last week, at which Harriman
was represented by General Freight
Agent Lure. At this meeting were rep
resentatives of the big lumber con
cerns, including C. A. Hooper & Co.,
F. P. & J. VST. Hooper, Pope & Talbot
and the E. K. Wood Lumber Company,
all of which have offices in this city
and agencies at San Pedro and the
Stimson Mill Company and the' Kerck
hoff & Cuzner Lumber Company of
Los Angeles and San Pedro.
BIG INTERESTS AT STAKE.
One of the first moves made was to
give notice to several big lumber com
panies at San Pedro to vacate the
wharve? and grounds owned by the Pa
cific Coast company, but leased to the
lumber concerns, the explanation given
by the company being that it would
need the wharves and yard space for
Jts own future business.
Up to this time the fight had in no
way concerned the Southern Pacific
Company, for it regarded th* trouble
as affecting traffic that its lines could
never expect to control, but when the
lumber companies that had been or
dered to move from San Pedro showed
the Harriman officials how their busi
ness was about to be ruined, the rail
road company was quick to jump into
the fight with a view of effecting an
immediate settlement.
HOOPERS MUST VACATE.
passenger traffic. Hardly had the Pa
cific Coast company announced Its
plans before It began to carry them into
effect.

Among the lumber mill companies
that are accused of handling passen
gers between coast ports, and against
%vhlch the Pacific Coast Company is
mainly directing its present fight, are
the Charles Nelson Company, J. R.
MANY MILLS INVOLVED.
To" the Bchooner owners the edict has
gone forth from the railroad that if
they persist In engaging in passenger
traffic the land lines will arrange for
carrying lumber and delivering it at
the points touched by the schooners at
a rate that will make freight handling
a ruinous business for the vessels now
engaged in It. "In short Harriman is
prepared . to stand by the interests,
which, apparently, without proper jus
tification, are' threatened with ruin by
the trade competition about to be in
augurated by the Pacific Coast Com
pany in the interests of its steamship
enterprise.
As yet no intimation as to what stand
it purposes to take in the face of Har
rlman's threat has been given by the
Pacific Coast Company, nor the own
ers of the schooners that are hauling
passengers up and down the coast, but
the presumption is that they will show
fight, for they laugh at the prospects of
the Southern Pacific Company engag
ing itself to haul lumber at this par
ticular time of the year, when," as its
own general manager has already-ad
mitted, it has not enough cars to meet
the demand of ordinary traffic over its
lines or" motive power to haul. its reg
ular trains. I
The Pacific Coast Company has been
Informed that -the Southern Pacific
Company's agents are ready to assist
the steamship company In an adjust
ment of the existing difficulties and
will even go so far as to temporarily
ally itself with the ocean line in forc
ing the lumber schooner owners out
of the business that does not seem to
properly belong to them, but in no case,
say the Southern Pacific Company's
agents,- will co-operation be undertaken
where it Is likely to affect -the lumber
trade as a whole, as the Pacific Coast
Company's project now threatens.
EDICT TO LUMBERMEN.
Then followed the mandate of Har
riman, issued through the office of
Traffic Director Stubbs in Chicago and
concurred in by the officials of the
Santa Fe road. The representatives of
the 'Pacific Coast Company were quiet
ly informed that while the* railroad
companies were in sympathy with their
concern in its efforts to protect its
ocean passenger traffic, the latter could
not be permitted to jeopardize the
whole lumber business of the coast and
deprive the railroads of their share of
natural traffic by indiscriminate Var
fare, as It was termed, against the big
traders of the State. I
were destroyed the Southern Pacific
and the Santa Fe companies would lose
a large amount of profitable local
traffic and it did not take the freight
traffic agents of the two roads long to
fully appreciate the danger that threat
ened them and to report the facts to
their superiors.

years, and informed her attendant at
the hospital that Michael Kelly of 719
Clay street, Oakland, was her brother.
At the secret meeting in Los Angeles
last week no definite action was de
cided on between the big lumber men
and Mr. Luce. The last named was
forced to leave the south in order to
Join General Manager Kruttschnitt and
other officials of the road in their Jour
ney over to Oerden,' but he made It
clear to the Hoopers and others at the
meeting that Harriman Is determined
to protect them and will personally
take up the matter, with Kruttschnitt
and Stubbs when he arrives here late
this week.
In fact, the business has become so
enormous that the railroads have been
forced to take cognizance of it, but
they have determined on -no plan by
which thev can get a share of it be
cause, as stated before. ] it is second
class traffic that would naturally go
to the Pacific Coast SteamshiD Com
pany if the latter's new competitor was
to withdraw from competition.
In so far as a fight with the Pacific
Coast Company is concerned, that is,
if the latter sho\ild see fit to defy , the
efforts of Harriman to bring about a
peaceful settlement of the existing
trouble for' the protection of the lum
ber interests that are contributing to
the railroad company's revenue in the
south, the railroad would have an ad
vantage over the steamship company.
It could make a deep cut into rates
between San Francisco and southern
ports and soon control a large share
of the business that it now permits the
steamships to enjoy. The cutting of
rates, however, is not to the ? liking of
the head of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, ' and it Is to avoid this that his
agents seek to bring about a settle
ment of the present troubles between
the Pacific Coast Company and the
lumber men in a more friendly manner.

the majority of which are carrying
passengers, who, in the absence of this
means of travel, .would have to patron

large number of these vessels load in
the north and on their way down the
coast put into this port for passengers,
frequently getting twenty and thirty
at a time.
At Grays Harbor ana on the Sound
the passenger business developed by
the schooners has beqome so large that
agencies have been establishd for plac

As the result of a conference held
yesterday in the office of Attorney Gen
eral Webb the United Railroads agreed
to pay into Judge Seawell's court the
taxes cm its personal property, aggre
gating in round numbers $400,000. The
corporation has been willing all along
to pay the taxes, but as it was as
sessed both by Assessor Dodge and the
State Board of Equalization it did not
know to whom to pay the money. It
has instituted euit on an interpleader
between the city and the State to de
termine which shall receive the taxes.
The conference was caljed for the
purpose of devising means whereby the
taxes could be paid into the treasury
so the city's portion could be made
available at once. There were present
at the conference besides Webb Dep
uty Attorney General Sturdivant. Dep
uty State Controller Douglas, District
Attorney Babcock of t>an Mateo, Dep
uty City Attorneys ikme and Brobeck
of this city and Tirey L. Ford and Wil
liam M. Abbott, attorneys representing
the United Railroads.
It was agreed that the taxes should
be paid in court and the city's por
tion, bas<?d on the tax rate of $1,076,
will be turned over to Tax Collector
Smith, while the State's portion, based
on a rate of 56.1. cents, will be paid into
the State treasury.
No matter what the decision of the
court may be, the United'Railroads will
thus settle its obligations, both with
the city and the State, and escape the
penalty for ticn-payment owing to the
conflict of authority in the premises.
The committee appointed will prob
ably meet soon to call a convention rep
resented by Congressional districts and
take vigorous action in accordance with
the desires of the members of the St.

meeting for the purpose of drawing a
bill to protect the pure grape wine of

some measure to sustain Dr. Wiley in \
his application tc- Congress to protect j

CADET â Reader, City. A young man

THE time is fast approaching when at the St. Louis
Exposition California must take her place among her
sister States and, in the stern competition among
them and the nations of the earth, be judged. By her works
and not by what she may say of herself the State will be
known. What she has done in her fields and farms, in her
orchards and vineyards, will tell the story of her value to
the seeker after wealth and' contentment. . How her people
have labored in the arts and sciences, what she has of re
fining, healthy civilization will be the test that will attract or
repel desirable settlers who want conditions better than
their own.
It is a duty, therefore, of the highest moment for every
county of the State to co-operate heartily and enthusiastically
with the commissioners of California to this great sample
emporium of the world's best things. Every endeavor must
be made to make California's display what it easily can beâ
the best in the United States. , We have wealth beyond com
pare and must show it that our words may not seem idle
boasting. It is from actual things, exhibits, visible, tangible
proof that the world judges, and these we must supply.
Our products themselves are our best praise. They speak
more eloquently than volumes of statistics or catalogues of
boasted advantages. Perhaps the virtues of exhibits, occa
sional and permanent have been most worthily recited in
the statement in The Call by Frank Wiggins, sec
retary of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. - On this
vitally important subject Mr. Wiggins, wrote as follows:'
"Besides maintaining a permanent exhibit of California
products in its own quarters, which has been visited by over
a million people, the chamber has had charge of and partici
pated in four local citrus fairs. The orange carnival in Chi
cago was visited by 100,000 people. Regular shipments of
fiuit were made to 'California on Wheels/ a traveling- ex

In descending the scale the wrist does
almost all the work in ' bringing\ the
third finger into position, and with it
the hand. Get the child to concentrate
his thought on his Wrist as much as
possible right here. The "imaginary
string," pulling the wrist sideways,
will help, and a few trials of the "wa
ter motion" will make it easier f~- him.
In both the ascending and descending
scale there is a decided lateral motion
of the wrist. In the ascending scale it
helps the thumb at the moment when
the thumb having moved up under the
hand until it stands over F, it drops
upon the key and the wrist motion
brings the hand along until each fin
ger stands free, in playing position
again.
â¢ . â¢ - â¢
The third finger is now once more in
its old place, over E, bringing the sec
ond finger over D and the thumb'over
C; so the rest of the descent Is simple
enough, always remembering to follow
all the rules.
All will be plain sailing until the
thumb (striking F) is reached. The
moment the thumb hits F the third
(middle) finger rises, -and, still keeping
its curved position, moves over the
thumb to the left until it stands up
raised (but still curved) over E. The
other fingers slip lightly along with it
but do not change their curved posi
tion In the meantime.
When the highest note of the octave
has been successfully reached start
down again by striking B with the
fourth finger and so on.
As soon as the thumb is in place on
the key of F make a revolution or two
of the circle motion to Insure perfect
freedom, and then let the fingers con
tinue their way up the scale to C, al
ways counting "one, two, three" be
tween each two movements of the
fingeÂ»s, taking plenty of time between
each two strokes to see that everything
is working correctly, but making the
stroke itself as rapid as possible in
each case.
The sweeping motion, . which brings
the thumb from the key of C to its po
sition over to F, all comes from the
tip of the thumb, in the same way as
does the lifting motion of the thumb
in the two-finger exercise. It is pre
cisely the same thing, except that one
motion is vertical and the other lateral.
The thumb, while in its upraised
position under the hollow of the hand,
must keep as free and easy of action as
when it is in its natural position on
the key. It is important that the pupil
should understand the exact position
of the thumb when held under the hand
in this position. It should be almost at
right angles from its ordinary playing
position, and yet the knuckles should
be curved as always, and not allowed
to become displaced.
tion. The arch of the knuckles must
remain perfect, and hand, fingers, wrist
and arm must be perfectly relaxed.
"The prisoner was a man. say 35
years old. He had been a typical mor
phine user, but evidently the drug had
long ago ceased to satisfy his cravings.
You would not believe that he went
to the gas burner in his cell for con

what hÂ« did do, and this is the way
he worked his extraordinary method of
stilling the nerve call for narcotics.
"The gas burner was out of reach
from the floor, so my man stood on
a chair and thus brought his mouth
and nostrils above the orifice. He turn
ed off the fluid, extinguishing the flame,
and waited a minute or two for the
burner to cool. Then, placing his mouth
over the burner, he turned on the key
and inhaled the poisonous fumes un
til almost overcome apparently. But
he retained sense enough to turn off
the key and then to get to his bunk.
The dose lasted him for several hours.
After recovering the gas fiend would
repeat the performance, and I have
known him to take three or four such
doses in a night. He said it was better
than morphine or any other drug he

Senator Perkins has served continuously since he "was
appointed, in 1893, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of
Senator Stanford, and ranks now quite among the seniors
of- the Senate. His experience and standing have won for
him steady progress on the committees, and he is now
chairman of the Committee on Civil Service and Retrench
ment â a leading committee â and is a member of the com
mittees on Appropriations, Commerce, Fisheries, Forest
Reservations, Naval Affairs and Transportation Routes to
the Seaboard. It will he observed that six of these com
mittees touch closely the interests of California, while the
Civil Service Committee relates to the whole Union.
Senator Bard has also fared well. He is chairman of the
Irrigation Committee â a leading place â and is a member of
the committees on Indian Affairs, Public Lands, Railroads,
-Territories and Woman Suffrage. Of these four have im
mediate bearing on the interests of this State and the West.
Our two Senators include in their. committee influence Ap
propriations, Commerce, Fisheries, Forest Reservations,
Naval Affairs, Transportation, Irrigation, Public Lands,
Railroads and Territories. Inspection of the new committee
list will show that in no other case do the assignments of
the two Senators from a State show as exact application to
the requirements of a constituency as theirs.
It is no easy matter to make a happy allotment of the
Senators to committees. There are fifty-five standing com
mittees ' of the Senate and ninety members to be placed.
Each party names its members to each committee, the ma
jority, of course, taking the majority of each and leaving
the lesser number to the "minority. There are fifty-seven
Republican Senators for placement on fifty-five committees.
As their party has upon it the responsibility that goes with
power, the assignment is no easy task. The people of this
State are to be congratulated that they fare so well.
The most noteworthy change in the Senate committees is
the passing of Senator Morgan from the chairmanship of
Interoceanic Canals. This was foreshadowed in his long and
vigorous fight against the Panama route. The Republican
Senate had kept him at the head of that committee, in recog
nition of the' great interest of the South in a canal. But
when his personal views became so indurated and stubborn
that he seemed incapable of looking over them to! the
broader issue involved, he naturally took on the character of
an obstructionist. In that capacity, soon after the meeting
of the present session, he attacked the administration in the
Panama: matter, and no one will more readily recognize the
propriety of retiring from the head of. the ; committee than
he. It is necessary to the construction of the canal that the
chairman of the committee shall work in harmony with the
administration. The minority will doubtless' give to Sena
tor Morgan a place on the committee, where it is to be
hoped he will be at last found working in harmony for the
success of the project.
IN" the committee assignments the California Senators
have fared well. This State is so remote and, after all,
is so little understood, that it needs the, power and in
fluence of consecutive service in both branches of Congress
in order to get the attention from the Government which
its interests require. ~

It seems almost incredible that the United States of Co
lombia wishes seriously to be annexed to the republic of
Panama, but the information to that effect seems to be
authoritative. Let no one dare to doubt hereafter the fable
of the tail that would wag the dog. But what impudence
there is in such a tail.
Suddenly he reached for the blank de
cree, gazed sharply at the- title and
then at the newspaper. Then he tore
up the legal document. On the. first
page of the paper were the pictures of
a man and a woman. Underneath them

Adams, who was drowned yesterday,
and of Mary Adams, his wife, who

Sometimes the first finger (thumb)
evinces a tendency to throw itself out of
joint at the lar~e knuckle. I' have often
seen this happen, when the other fin
gers were all under perfect control, and
there was apparently no reason for it.
It signifies absolutely nothing but a
slight wpaknPFS of that particular Joint
and a little lack of control, and while
cot in the least alarming is something
which must not be allowed to go on.
The only way to cure it is to stop the
exercise and bring the knuckle back
Into position every time it happens â a
thousand times if necessary. It some
times takes weeks to effect a complete

fault never returns, and it is worth
overcoming, not only because the trou

this must be done as lightly and deli

taken that the stroke is not slovenly
and that the finger hits the center of
the key, so as to avoid hitting the note
on either side of the one in present use.

of Kins Otho of Greece, in 1859, were
due to the failure of the soldiers to
rally round their sovereign in moments
when the latter were in open conflict
with their people â that is to say, with
the state â while It was solely due to
the loyalty of the army to the monarch
and to its preferring its allegiance to
the crown to its obligations to the peo

As the original supporter of the free market. The Call
points out the impolicy of rushing to the conclusion that its
failure is due to the non-action' of the- Harbor Commission,
which we think is not the case. To put the blame there is
to continue what we think will be found to.be the real
cause â the inertia of the producers themselves. When that
is overcome the market will appear.
If organization among the producers will do it, they
should organize. They have an excellent organization al
ready in the Grange. It is found in- nearly every rural
neighborhood. It holds annual State conventions. Its
purpose is to promote the social side of rural life and
defend rural industries against unjust : aggression. Why
is not this relation of producer to consumer a proper
object of its solicitude? We have certain city or
ganizations. One, we believe, is composed of ladies who
refuse to trade at stores where the women help are not sup
plied with proper facilities for resting, but are compelled to
stand on their feet all day long. That is a praiseworthy
purpose. Why cannot such an organization agree to go
marketing to the free market, or to take household supplies
from the peddlers and distributers who get their stock in
that market? - . ' . .
A CORRESPONDENT recalls the pioneer effort made
by The Call for a free market, in which the producer
and consumer of fruits and vegetables can come into
immediate relations. The Call led public sentiment to de
mand such a market, and after a long struggle a law was
passed empowering the Harbor Commission to furnish fa
cilities for it on the public docks which belong to the State.
We are not aware of any action on the part of the. Har
bor Commission to evade the law or refuse the facilities it
provides. Yet there is no market on the designated' dock
where producer and consumer come together, ana the cur
rent rates of domestic supplies of fruits and vegetables fur
nish evidence that tae consumer is being squeezed, but not
for the benefit of the producer.
It is the same condition that prompted The Call's first
action in this matter. As an illustration of what then ex
isted, we showed that a grower of sweet potatoes had to let
his fine crop rot in the ground because the combination of
middlemen offered him less than the cost of digging, while
the consumer was paying a price that would have netted
the producer $600 per acre for his crop. He would have
been content with a less return that would have promoted
consumption by a lower price to the consumer, but between
producer and consumer there was a control that neither
could master, so good food rotted and the consumer was
exploited.
One need not go far afield in search for proof of the
present existence of the same conditions. The question is.
Can it he retredied? We are convinced that if producer and
consumer meet on the free market dock they can deal with
each other. But they don't seem to meet there. Professor
Hilgard says it is due to the lack of a faculty of organization
in the producers. But. by natural law, where the demand
is, there the supply should gravitate. And so, where the
supply is. there demand will go for satisfaction. The trou
ble seems to be that the producers have not the habit of
attending to their own business, and they don't know how.
Every day nearly 400,000 consumers in this city pay cash
for their fruit and vegetable supply. At a low estimate the
daily supply costs $40,000. If the producer and consumer
could be brought together, the exchange of products for
money would amount to that every day. Who and where
is the wizard that can bring them together? It must be
done by each class taking on a new habit, of going to mar
ket, one to sell and the other to buy. Is it possible that
the water front is not conveniently located for the buyers?
Would they focus the demand in one place and tempt the
supply to come there if the location were different? To
make a market there must be buyers and sellers, and where
they are not there is no exchange and no market.
Some suggest that the geographical location of San Fran
cisco, in its relation to the source of supply, is against a
fiee market, for a producer can't hitch up his team and load
his market wagon and take an all-road drive to (town. In
all the large Eastern cities there are fine free markets,
largely patronized, and banked around them are the carts
and wagons of the producers who have driven in, in the
early hours of the morning, the loads that they stowed the
night before. Such was the custom in the remote time
when those cities were villages, and it is a fixed habit that
has followed their growth. But it seems never to have
been the custom here. .How shall it be made so?
When Mascon was not watching
Luigi slid without a cry into the icy
waters. Some one will" pick Mascon
up, he thought, and then the children,
won't have to starve. But he was not
to be allowed to- go to his death un
seen. Calling to him to swim for his
life Mascon plunged from the raft to
the aid of his fellow fisherman, who
he thought had become exhausted and
lost his hold.
Vainly he attempted to reach him
and get back to the raft again, but the
waves were cruel and beat him unmer
cifully in the face, taking away his
breath. Luigi, knowing that death
stared them in the face, made a last
attempt to reach Mascon. Fate was
against them and the morning sun
rose over the watery grave of two he-
But a sudden flurry capsized the
craft, which sank immediately. The
men hung to a hatch that floated free
from the boat. . It soon became appar
ent that the small mass of boards
would not hold the two of them. Luigi
thought quickly. He had no one to
depend on him. Mascon had always
been as a brother to him ar.d had once
saved his life at the risk of his own.
Yes, what did he care for life if his
brother should perish? One of them
had to let go the frail raft in, order
that the other might be saved.
, Luigi and Mascon were two Italian
fishermen who sailed the deep waters
of the Golden Gate and out beyond into
the blue waves of the Pacific in search
of the finny inhabitants of the ocean.
It was one day in November that the
two fishermen sailed out through the
heads with the hope of filling their lit
tle smack with the diet of Fridays. The
weather was threatening, but Mascon,
the master of the craft, knew that
there were four little mouths to feed
at home and four little bodies to clothe.
Luigi had no special need to venture
from the wharves on that day, but
as Mascon's companion and fearing
nothing lie went. Outside the heads
a few miles the small boat was struck
by a terrific gale. All thought of a
catch that day was abandoned and the
two men put about the boat to make
for the harbor.

In affecting this sleight of hand move
ment, so to speak, the hand must not
for an instant be thrown out of posi-
Â¦The thumb takes the place of the
fourth finger, on F, and as the thumb
is lowered over the note the other four
fingers fall at once into position on the
remaining four notes.
It would be well right here to remind
the pupil that the notes occupied by his
five fingers are C, D, E. F, G, and that
the other notes in this octave are A.
B and C. Consequently the note that
the thumb is hovering over, ready to
strike, is F, as E has just been struck
by the third finger.
As the thumb falls on F. the second
finger is again raised, and falls in its
turn on G. Then the third finger
strikes A (still emitting no sound), the
fourth falls on B, and the fifth finger
(little) takes the only note left to it
(C) and so completes the octave.
With the hand at playing position,
raise the first finger (thumb) of the
right hand slowly, according to the
two-finger, non-striking exercise. At
the count three lower it instantly (noc
striking) and raise the second finger,
also according to the two-finger, non
strikins exercise. Here, however, the
similarity between the two exercises
ceases^ As the second finger drops
again into place after being upraised,
the third finger rises (at the count
"three," as did the second finger be
fore it). At the same time (and here
the pupil must attend very carefully,
for it is most important) the first finger
(thumb) leaves its place on the key
(C), and. while the rest of the hand in
no way alters its position, the thumb
moves under the second finger, toward
the right, or upper part of the piano,
until, as the third finger stands up
raised, the thumb is over the same key
as is the fourth finger, and is held up
until it almost touches the palm of the
hand, as it waits for the signal to
drop; for in this case the thumb (first
finger) is to strike the note that, in or
dinary sequence, 'would be struck by
the xc-jrth finger, and it must be ready
to do so the instant the third finger
drops upon its note.

through the State.
"The State Board of Trade has never thought, nor does
it now think, that the highest function is to stimulate a large
movement of people into the State, without reference to
their-condition, unless intelligent direction is given newcom
ers after they are here, that they may in selecting future
homes do so with judgment and wisdom and. become con
tented and prosperous citizens.
"In this direction the State board stands alone â so far as
the central and northern parts of the State are concerned.
Bare statistics do not give all the information required by
the homeseeker; statistics are valuable and often important,
but they need to be supported with general information in
respect to conditiqns in the'various districts of the State."
With such advantages for proper presentation of the re
sources of the State at hand it seems suicide on the part of
any county that will net take instant measures to avail itself
of them.
The manifold advantages of adequate display by the coun
ties of California at St. Louis simply emphasize the need of
permanent exhibits in large centers of population in Cali
fornia. While we are to gain much by entering as we
should into the world-wide competition made possible by
the exposition, we should not forget that thousajids of vis
itors arc entering' California every month. They go, natu
rally, to our great cities, to Los Angeles, San Francisco,
San Jose or Sacramento. They come with a purpose to in
vestigate us and our conditions, for themselves. They have
money to invest in new enterprises and in new homes. They
wish to improve and cultivate our rich lands, but they want
to see what we can do and what we have to offer.
Where better may they see our resources in actual results
than in permanent displays prominently and attractively
made in San Francisco or elsewhere? That we have such a
display the splendid work of the State Board of Trade
amply attests. This is what Arthur R. Briggs, manager, of
the State Board <*f Trade, had to say on this subject in The
Call, and his words should be heeded by the progressive
people of every county in California. In part he said:
"No one can form anything like a correct estimate of the
wonderful resources and marvelous productiveness of the
State without seeing and investigating for himself. The ex
hibits which have been maintained by the board during the
period of its existence, since 1888, are object lessons which
unfold to the newcomer some idea of the productiveness
and agricultural wealth of the State. These object lessons
give to many people information that cannot be obtained
in any other way except by personal observation and travel
tic building at the Midwinter Fair in Sc . Francisco. A
permanent exhibit was maintained in Chicago for two years
which was visited by half a million people. A most suc
cessful display of products was made by the Chamber of
Commerce at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in
1901, the secretary of the chamber remaining in Buffalo dur
ing the entire period of the exposition.
"Other exhibits have been made by the Chamber of Com
merce at Hamburg, at Guatemala, at Atlanta, at Omaha, at
the World's Fair in Paris and at many other places.
"The chamber maintains a permanent exhibit in the Board
of Trade rooms in San Francisco."

He had not been in office long before
he began to feel the effects of the large
amount of routine work that devolves
upon the head of the office and as time
wore on the demands that this work
made on his time and strength and the
constant friction that has been Inci
dental to the office under every admin
istration led to his distaste for the of
fice. Mr. Ware has insisted on the ex
pedition of the work of his bureau and
improvement of the standard of ser
vice performed by the personnel of his
bureau, and it is said to be probable
that the work of the office will be
brought up to. date by the 1st o'f July,
the beginning of the next fiscal year.
Despite the secrecy with' which the
proposed change of the head of the
pension bureau has been guarded, a
number of candidates already have de
veloped. Ex-Representative Richard
Whiting Blue and ex-Representative
Samuel W. Peters of Kansas have been
mentioned in connection with the suc
cessor to Mr. Ware.
Mr. Ware's acceptance of the office
last spring created much surprise at
the time.* He had a law practice that
was one of the largest in Kansas and it
brought him considerably more income
than his salary as Commissioner of
Pensions.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.â It can be
announced that Eugene F. Ware, the
Commissioner of Pensions, will retire
from that office by about the middle of
November, next year, and will return
immediately to the practice of law in
Kansas. His contemplated action is
generally understood among Kansas
politicians and has been made the sub
ject of several interviews with the
President, which have been kept secret.
The decision to resign and return to
private life is /the result of his long
felt dissatisfaction with the nature of
the duties of- his office, a feeling that
has grown steadily since the early days
of his administration of that bureau.
Mr. Ware has steadfastly refused to
discuss the matter and to-night de
clined to admit that he has or ever had
any intention of tendering his resigna
tion.
Colonel Dunn confirmed the state
ment which had been made by Gov
ernor Odell that a satisfactory agree
ment of the measures at issue had been
reached, and he added that all the
Republicans in New York State would
work in harmony for the success of the
national and State tickets. "You will
observe," said Colonel Dunn, figura
tively speaking, "that there has been
a lot of hot bricks thrown around, but
they have not been hitting anybody."
Colonel Dunn will leave for New York
to-morrow morning.
Both Senator Platt and Governor
Odell have announced their desire that
President Roosevelt next year should
be nominated and elected. It can be
stated, however, that at the confer
ence to-night the subject ol national
politics was not considered except that
in so far as New York State politics
naturally merged into national affairs.
Senator Platt drove, from the White
House to the Arlington Hotel and re
tired at once to his apartments. He
declined to discurs in any way the
results of the conference, but it Is un
derstood they were entirely satisfactory
to him.
It is understood authoritatively that
Governor Odell was accorded practical
ly all for which he contended. The
agreement reached to-night is of such
a character that it is not considered
now that the necessity for future con
ferences will exist. It can be said that
Senator Platt will continue as the lead
er of the New York Republican organ
ization, but that Governor Odell will
direct in detail the campaign in New
York next year.
ODELL GAINS HIS POINT.
The conference to-night was stated,
after its dose, to have been more than
satisfactory. Senator Platt and Gov
ernor Odell have come to an obsolute
agreement, and both will work in per
fect harmony with each other and
with the President /or the promotion
of the welfare of the Republican party.
The conference was concluded short
ly after 10 o'clock. Governor Odell,
from the White House, went directly
to the Metropolitan Club. He declined
to make any extended comment on the
conference, but, pressed for a state*
ment, said:
"A satisfactory and harmonious
agreement has been reached. Matters
at issue have been compromised and
satisfactorily arranged."
At midnight Governor Odell left for
New York.
For several months it has been
known that political differences existed
between Governor Odell and Senator
Platt. These differences were of such a
character as to cause concern in the
minds of their friends, although they
did not take the form of an alignment
of factions in New York State. They
grew out of State appointments origin
ally, and, it is stated, practically were
confined to State affairs. The fear was,
expressed by some friends of President
Roosevelt that the trouble between the
Governor and Senator Platt sooner or
later might include national political
features; but it can be said authori
tatively that at no time has either
Governor Odell nor Senator Platt
wavered in his loyalty to President
Roosevelt.
Yesterday Senator Platt returned
from Now York to Washington, accom
panied by Colonel Dunn. On Monday,
by Invitation of President Roosevelt,
they took luncheon at the White House.
PRESIDENT AS PEACE MAKER.
At that time the President expressed
a strong desire that whatever differ
ences existed between the Senator and
Governor Odell should be adjusted.
After the luncheon the President tele
graphed to Governor Odell an invita
tion to come to Washington to discuss
the New York situation with him and"
Senator Platt. Governor Odell arrived
here to-day in response to the invita
tion and he and the other parties to
the conference dined with the Presi
dent at the White House this evening.
The President believed that the time
had come, in view of the numerous ru
mors about, that it would be a good

Those who have never tried the ex-
periment of leaving off qoffee and
drinking Postum in its place, and in
this way regaining health and happi-
ncps, can learn much from the experi-
ence of others who have made the trial.
One who knows says:. "I drank coffee
for hreakfast every morning until I had
terrible attacks of indigestion, produc-
ing days of discomfort and nights of
BlceplfesnesB. I tried to give up the
use of coffee entirely, but found it hard
to c f > from hot coffee to a glass of
water. Then I tried Postum Food Cof-
fee.
"It was good, and the effect was so
pleasant that I soon learned to love it
and have used it for several years. I
improved immediately after I left off
coffee and -took on Postum, and am
now entirely cured of my indigestion
and other troubles, all of which were
due to coffee. I am now well and con-
tented, antl all because I changed from
coffee to Postum.
"Postum is much easier to make
right every time than coffee, for.it is
so even and always reliable. We never
use coffee now in our family. We use

e don t think we have talked en-
ough about "King Calf." It is
our own exclusive leather, made be-
cause no other leather was good
enough. It is chrome-tanned, from selected skins. It is
practically indestructible. To all intents it is water proof.
It is soft, smooth and pliable. It has the feeling of kid
and.the toughness of raw-hide.
King Calf Shoes are shoes for service. And they
look well. They have the Regal style. Made on lasts
of various shapes in siloes of all styles. One man we
know Has worn one pair of King Calf shoes in all; rough
weather in town, and in woods and mountains in vaca-
tion time, for all of three years-^and the leather is still
unbroken. We can't guarantee such wear, but it doesn't
surprise us. Â¦
$3.50â same as all other Regals. S
There are 60 Regal Storesâ 20 of them in Greater New
York, where the styles originate. The new styles are on sale in
our San Francisco store at the same time as in the New York
stores. ; Other dealers get the same styles a year later.

OF THE RIVAL
HEAVY-WEIGHTS
that has been brewing at Larkspur
came to a climax yesterday, when
Casey, In the presence of Gardner,
Foley, Eddie Graney and newspaper
men, sneaked a right cross which land
ed on Ferguson's jaw. Ferguson shook
himself together and sailed Into Mr.
Casey. In -a minute the pair were bat
tering away at each other for keeps.
Casey used choice expressions every
time he aimed "a punch at -Ferguson
and the latter lost his temper com
pletely. Ferguson was first to- stop.
Casey pulled off his gloves and started
to mix things again, but "Billy" Pierce
pluckily got between the giants and
kept them apart. Casey was bleeding
profusely from abrasions and cuts and
he descended to the rubdown room to
repair damages. Ferguson followed
and the fray was started <over again.
Casey threatened to shoot and "Sandy"
grabbed two bottles to protect himself.
.Afgaln they were separated, and the
upshot of It all was that Casey packed
his grip and departed on the next train.
Ferguson has a bad temper and is un
popular with every one over there.
Gardner taught him a lesson a few days
ago and Harry Foley has been trying
some choice wallops on the -.boy won

Ryan to Fight Jack O'Brien.
CHICAGO, Nov. 24.â Tommy Ryan
and Jack O'Brien were matched to-day
for a six-round contest to be held in
Philadelphia about the first of the year.
The fight Is to be at catch weights and
if both men are on their feet, at the end
of the sixth round a twenty-round bout
will be fought in some other city.
Gardner submitted to a physical ex
amination at the hands of Dr. Clarence
F. Tillman yesterday. The doctor went
into raptures over his subject. He said
he was one of the finest physical speci
mens he had ever gazed upon. Dr.
Tillman's examination of Gardner was
a careful one. He, used the stethoscope
and other scientific. instruments to test
Gardner's heart and lungs. He tapped
him and noted his heart beats,.exam
ined his pulse and felt the firmness of
his muscles, and when he finished de-
Gardner rested yesterday. It was the
first time in four weeks that the cham
pion eased up in his training. He -slept
half the time, and when called by his
trainers he dressed and took a short
stroll through the canyon near Lark
spur. He was accompanied by Billy
Pierce, his manager. Gardner was in
the best of spirits. He did not worry
over his- coming "contest, but took
things as a matter of course. Never
was a' boxer more confident of winning.
Gardner never for a moment derided
his opponent or plumed himself.' He
simply announced that he expected
some hard knocks from Fitzsimmons
to-night, and: he was in shape to as
similate any punches he might deliver.
He has the highest regard for Fitz as
a fighter, and yet he is supremely con
fident that he will take the Cornish
man's measure.
GARDNER ENJOYS A REST.
George Gardner, the Lowell boxer,
will make his most ambitious bid for
pugilistic fame to-night when he faces
Bpb Fitzsimmons in a twenty-four-foot
ring In Mechanics' Pavilion. "When
betting commenced ten days ago Fitz
simmons was at once Installed a 1 to
2 choice, which was an indication of
what the public thought of the rela
tive merits of the two men at that
time.
Since then there has been a decided
change of sentiment. The odds fluctuat
ed yesterday between 10 to 9 and 10 to
SVÂ£, the latter being the closing price.
The marked change in the betting Is duo
to the fact that Fitzsimmons has had
several setbacks in his training and is
not as good as he and his admirers
would wish hlm.^ He has been suffer
ing from a cold and from blistered feet,
both of which have hindered him in
his work in the gymnasium and on the
road.
While Fitzsimmons has had his set
backs in training a visitor at his quar
ters yesterday afternoon would never
believe it. He devoted his attention
chiefly to the punching bag. For thirty
five minutes he belabored this until the
din raised sounded like distant thun
der to the passersby. There was never
a sign of weakening nor of distress in
arms, legs or breathing apparatus. The
perspiration flowed freely until his
whole bo*dy was aglow.
While his work looked impressive
Fitz kept complaining about a stiff
ness in the cords of his neck and of
a general disinclination to exert him
self.. When he finished his work he
stepped on the scales and the bar bal
anced at 163 pounds. On the day before
Fitz was down to 161 pounds. His
muscles stand out like whipcords,
showing he has done a lot of work.
Trouble is expected to-day over the
bandages. The articles allow soft
surgical bandages. These are the ones
Fitz will use, but he wants to put them
on .before he leaves his hotel to-night.
Gardner objects to this, insisting that
they be adjusted in the ring. Fitz-
Eimmons professes to believe that
Gardner wants to use for a bandage
what is commonly called tire tape.
This hardens into a solid mass, and
when used with boxing gloves cuts
like a knife. The question of bandages
will probably be settled at "weighing
in time, thus preventing any tiresome
delay in the ring.
clared him a marvel In physical devel
opment.
BANDAGES ARE DISCUSSED.
The doctor also measured Gardner,
and his measurements showed him to
be as big as Fltzslmmons in every way.
Gardner expressed himself freely to
Referee Graney on the bandage ques
tion. Graney brought over a piece of
surgical plaster that Fitz intends put
ting on his hands shortly before the
contest. Gardner says he will not per
mit Fitz to do this. He was informed
months ago that Fitz usecj bandages of
this kind on his hands when he mtt
Jeffries and every time he hit Jeffries
he cut him. Gardner is willing to allow
Fitzsimmons to wear bandages, but he
is not willing to have the bandages in
the form of hard bands. Referee Granny
promised to see to it that the bandages
worn by both men were the proper
kind.
The men will weigh in at 60 Ellis
street at 3 o'clock to-day. Harry Cor
bett has issued tickets to the newspa
per men and those interested in the
weighing of the big fighters. Gardner
will weigh not more than 167 pounds, as
he has dried out and is within the
weight. Fitz will probably weigh not
more than 164 pounds, if either man is
over 168 pounds he forfeits (2500.
Eddie Graney will referee the main
event. Graney will don his Tuxedo, as
the contest is for the championship.
Tiv Kreling, the crack Olympic Club
boxer and wrestler of some years ago.
will referee the two preliminaries. The
latter will be between Johnny Ritchie
and Georgie Curran at 120 pounds, and
Mauro Hen-era of Bakersfleld and Joe
Welch, who hails from Missouri, at 135
pounds. Both bouts will be of six
rounds' duration.
An effort will be made to get the bis
fellows into the ring not later than 9:45
p. m. This is done in order thai the
report of the battle may be sent to
Eastern newspapers in time for theJr
early editions.
CASEY AGAIN LEAVES CAMP.
Casey, the Irish giant who worked
with Fltzslmmons for a few days' and
left because Fitz wanted him to do
menial work. Quit "Sandy" Ferguson
yesterday because the big heavy-weight
used rough tactics. Ferguson boasted
each day that he would knock Casey
out and the latter. objected. Not that
he feared "Sandy," but because he did
not think Ferguson was pursuing the
right course in training. The trouble

both pitchers were in superb form. Cor

Hodson had on fogproof armor and
a sDecial mitt that guided the sphere
safely through the atmc-sphere. The
Cripples were always worried when the
leather came Eailingr up and the best
they made during the progress of the
battle was three hits. They also man
aged to pile up three runs, but one was
all they had coming, and that one came
about in the initial inning.
Up to the last period the home per
formers fielded well. Then they got
rattled for the time being and Shay
and Pabst committed three errors be
tween them which were instrumental
in allowing two of the Cripples to hot
foot It over the pan.
Pat Meany lined out a home run clout
in the eighth inning. This was one
of the prettiest ever seen ion any ball
field. It took a straight course direct
ly over the second bag and avoided
O'Hara, going right out to the fence.
Pat took on a good burst of speed as
soon as he rounded the turn of the sec
ond bag and easily beat the throw to
the p'.ate. The score:
Oakland â Â¦ I San Francisco â
The foe was so thick yesterday on
the Oakland ball field that Mr. Mc-
Kay's offerings could not penetrate its
dense banks at 'their usual speed, so
therefore when the ball reached the
plate it was generally tame and easy.
The Natives always met the leather for
a fare-ye-well when it came lobbing
up, and that's the reason they won, 7
to 2.

closed at odds of 9 to 5, and finished
nearly two lengths in advance of James

second choice, died away In the stretch,

Ben MacDhui scored his third
straight victory in the concluding mile

â¢ The track was heavy, but form was
well maintained. But for the downfall
of Fossil six favorites would have gone
through. A chunk of fog obscured a
clear view of the second 'event, but
this gradually lifted. The attendance
was large as usual.
Buxton got bo rattled near the pad
dock that he Quit riding and threw
away the place to Greenock. Then
came the second ovation. Buxton was
liberally hooted by a big gathering of
bettors and for his negligence was sus
pended for tw6 weeks by the Judges.

favorite's pilot did not get scared. Vet

ed, failed to back up and won by six
lengths.
As he and his mount passed the stand
they were the recipients of a mild ova
tion. When they returned after the
finish another one was tendered, only
it was different. According to an alge
braic computation, counting the time
the ficJd was at the post and the time
consumed in running the race, Buxton
was a public idol for four minutes,
twenty nine and three-quarter seconds.
Eddie Sweeney was elected for an un
expired term and served one whole day.
JEERS FOR BUXTON
All summer long things were dull
with Buxton. He finally did get a
chance to do some riding up in the
Jungles of Oregon and Washington,
where squash and pumpkins are rec
ognized as legal currency and whiskers
worn by the male element reach a
length of four feet three and a
half Inches without artificial irrigation.
Indeed, Buxton became the real thing
in those remote regions.
In an indulgent mood the stewards
at Oakland track restored the rider to
good standing on Monday. For his re
appearance Buxton had the mount on
Fossil yesterday, the even .money fa
vorite for the fourth event, a mile and
a furlong: selling affair.
On the closing: day of the meeting at
Oakland last spring Buxton had the
mount on Divina. At the first turn
he bumped and threw Dr. Boyle, the
favorite. For this breach of turf eti
quette he was Indefinitely suspended
by the Judges.
Poor Jockey Buxton! His reign as a
popular Idol was even shorter than
Eddie Sweeney's term as Police Judge.

One of the best paintings of Rix ia
now in possession of the Bohemian
Club and represents the Christmas
greeting sent by the painter to the
club in 1881. It is a blending of winter
scenery in the East and glorious sun
shine effect of California, typical of the
artist's greeting from the snowbound
coast of the Atlantic to the summery
skies of the Golden State.
One of the last works of Rix is now
in possession qf William Morris, the art
dealer, of this city. It depicts a winter
scene near Harlem, N. Y., and. its glow-
Ing sunset effect is somewhat Turner -
esque.
Rix never married. His father,
Judge Alfred Rix, is still alive and re
sides in San Francisco, and this city is
also the home of two half-brothers and
one full brother of the dead artist. Ed
ward A. Rix, an electrical engineer, Is
a full brother of the dead man, and his
half-brothers are,, William Rix, the at
torney, and A. S. Rix, manager of a
commercial firm.
While Rix never attained a standing
that might be called "great," he was
undoubtedly one of the best landscape
painters in America. He had a wonder
ful faculty of reproduction of scenery
and was a superb colorist. His work
was sincere and honest, and he was
loyal to his profession and did not al
low fame to interfere with his artistic
productions.
WAS SINCERE IN HIS ART.
For the last fifteen years Rix spent
most of his time in New York, though
he returned to California last year and
spent one month at Santa Barbara
painting landscapes. He was a mem
ber of the Lambs' and Lotus Clubs of
New York.
Miss King was 24 years old and had

was found in the laundry in the base
ment, with one end of a piece qf rub
ber tubing in her mouth and the other
end affixed to the gas burner. A doctor
was summoned and pronounced her
beyond the reach of resuscitation.
Gould was one of the directors of the
home and played a prominent part In
the legislative Investigation 'Into the
affairs of the home last spring. It was
alleged that he took the girl from that
institution without authority of the
board of directors to work as a servant
for him. Coroner Leland avoided this

Julian Walbrldge Rix, the famous
landscape painter, died in New York
City yesterday Crom the result of an
operation, and 1 the news of his demise
was received with deep regret in San
Francisco, where, he lived for many
years. . .
Rix was born in Peacham, Vt., In
1851, and came to California with hjs
father. Judge Alfred Rix, when he was
a child. " At the age of 8 years Rix was
sent to his 'native State and was edu
cated there, and returned to San Fran
cisco when he was 15 years of age.
As a boy he showed promise of be
coming an artist, but his father vas
opposed to his son's selection of a ca
reer and apprenticed him to a firm of
house and sign painters, hoping to cure
the lad of any desire of becoming an
artist. I
Young Rix, however, did not take
klndiy to house painting and was soon
engaged in the work of getting up deco
rative signs. This wlietted his appetite
for drawing, and he astonished his
friends by his work. He attracted the
attention of Jules Tavernier, Tom Hill
and Virgil Williams, and was enrolled
as one of the first pupils of the San
Francisco Art Association. William
Morris, the art dealer, also lent his
counsel and aid to young Rix, arid the
result was that it was not long ere
Rix was in demand.
WEALTHY. MEN HIS PATRONS.
Rix rapidly came to the front as a
painter of California scenery, and his
works were purchased by the late C.
P. Huntington, Irving M. Scott, William
[ Morris, the Crockers and Louis Sloss.
The Bohemian Club also encouraged
Rix, and many of his paintings were
secured by the club and are .among its
most valued belongings. He was made
an honorary life member of the Bohe
mian Club, and wealthy patrons came
to him in number.
HONOLULU, Nov. 18.â J. 'Nurney of
the Sixty-seventh Coast Artillery, sta
tioned here, was found guilty of petty
larceny by a jury In Judge. Gear's
court and sentenced to pay a fine of
$50. Nurney is one of three soldiers
who were arrested for burglary and re
arrested against the protest of the mil
itary authorities on charges of larceny
when the burglary indictment was
found to be defective. The action of
the civil authorities in pressing the
cases after one release caused some
animated correspondence between Ma
jor McClellan and Governor Dole, and
it is understood that the major made
a protest to the War Department on
the ground that the men were taken by
the police after they had been arrested
on a military warrant. Nurney's two'
companions were acquitted. .

A witness, D. J. Brown, was produced
by the contestants, who testified that
he was the confidential adviser of Mrs.

Mrs. McDermott, he said, told him that
phe had made no will. This testimony

It Is claimed by those upholding: the

presence of two witnesses, C. MIchener
and James Kerwln. The handwriting
expert stated positively that the man
who wrote the name C. Micheaer is
the person who* attached the cross be
tween the words "Bridget McDermott."
A large number of exemplars of Mrs.
McDermott's crosses signed to various
documents, and admittedly genuine,
Â¦were produced, no one of which bore
the slightest resemblance to that upon
the will, according to EisenschimeL
Mrs. Catherine Foye, who found the
will now in Question, was subjected to
a rigid crcÂ» -examination on the part
of the contestants, but her testimony
was r.ot shaken. If fraud was prac
ticed in the production of the will Mrs.
Foye appears to be wholly innocent in
the matter. She stated that she was
at the McDermott house on the night
Mrs. McDermott died: that on that
night Mrs. Mary Anne Burns, who, with
John J. Fannen, are the sole legatees,
gave her a basket containing clothes
and asked her to take it to her home
and keep it until called for. This she
did.

THE POPULARITY OF OUTDOOR SPORTS
~^â WAS NEVER MORE IN EVIDENCE THAN TO-DAY
"AT WORK"
'. â¢ Â¦ '
The publisher of The Call, in anticipating the tendency of the times
( in giving more time to recreation, hunting and fishing, has acquired for
their exclusive use a series of art pictures which will serve as reminders
during the busy months of those delightful days passed in the field.
"At Work," the title of the next Sunday Call's offering, is a reproduc-
tion from an oil painting by J. M. Tracy, an artist whose paintings of
dogs have never been surpassed.
Mr. Tracy had for the subject of this study the celebrated Llewellyn
setter, "BODEBIGO," who became famous in this country by his clean
sweep of bench and field events.
This picture, while it appeals strongly to those who know every point
in a dog, is perhaps just as interesting to the many who love the faithful
animal.
In handling, color and action, "At Work" is a most life-like study; a
picture that, when framed, could with difficulty be distinguished from
the original oil painting.
g To overlook this is to miss one of the best of the Sportsmen's Series.

A quarter of a million school children
in California will be interested In the
fact that they or some of them have
afforded enough educational exhibits,
in connection with the photographs,
etc., supplied by school authorities and
boards of education, to already over
crowd the space allowed to California
in the educational building at St.
Louis. Not all the tounties have made
arrangements to be advertised educa
tionally at St. Louis. There are ten
counties at least in the list of those*
that will not show as counties. They
may take part in the collective Califor
nia show, but not individually.
Robert Furlong, head of the division
of education for California, acting un
der the direction of the California Com
missioners to the exposition, said yes
terday . that much more space could
have been well filled with California's
educational display if it had. been pro
curable. The educational part of Cal
ifornia's offerings is not proportionate
ly larger than is the general collections
from the several counties that are at
work. As a matter of fact, there is a
demand for at least four times as much
space in the collective California dis
play as is allotted to the entire State.
As a result the California Commission
ers ! are full of business, trying to ad
just matters as nearly as possible to
the satisfaction of the people. Uncle
Sam is reaping a harvest from the
postage needed to carry the letters of
explanation, inquiry and demand.
Educational Chief Furlong says that
it Is about settled that Stanford Uni
versity will not exhibit at St. Louis.
After the first exclusive announcement
in The Call to that effect there was
some hope that the authorities at Stan
ford would find a way to make some
sort of a showing, but as nothing has
been heard for some time Mr. Furlong
thinks that Stanford will not be rep
resented.
One striking fact about the Califor
nia educational exhibit will be the
work of the technical schools in this
city, the California School of Mechan
ical Arts, otherwise known as the Lick
School; the Polytechnic High School,
the Coggswell Polytechnic School and
the" Wilmerdlng School. The ]ast
named is under the same direction as
the Lick School. These four institu
tions can make a fine showing collec
tively in the line of practical education.

Desertion Is the ground on which
Charles H. Gage is seeking a divorce
from Pauline M. Gage. He complains

at Los Angeles. They were married
June 30, 1897.
Interlocutory decrees of divorce were
granted by Judge Kerrigan to Emma
G. Hall from Ed G. Hall for desertion
and Mae E. Hagler from William Hag

FEARS HER HUSBAND.
Gelhaus is a coal dealer on Four
teenth" street. He was married at San
Jose in 1894. Three months ago Mrs.
Gelhaus sued him for divorce on the
ground*, of cruelty. 'He filed a .cross
complaint, in which he also charged
cruelty. When the case came -up for
trial Judge , Graham advised them for
the sake of the children to make-up.
Gelhaus .was willing^ but his wife was
not, and Judge Graham, hoping she
would change her mind, continued the
ckse.* At the second hearing Mrs. Gel
haus was still obdurate," and Judge
Graham again continued the .case.
The reconciliation. was not effected un
til yesterday morning, a short- time be
fore the case was called for the third
time. '
The efforts of Judge Graham to ef
fect a reconciliation between Wilhel
mina Gelhaus and Frank Gelhaus. prin
cipals ; in divorce proceedings in his
court, proved fruitful| yesterday. Mrs.
Gelhaus, for trie sake of her children,
consented to a dismissal â¢ of the suit
brought by her, Gelhaus withdrew his
cross-complaint' and together they
walked ; out of the courtroom. They
were followed by nine of their children,
the tenth being a babe In arms.
She was penniless, she says, and but
for her friends and relatives j would
have been in a sorry plight. They came
to her rescue, says the affiant, provided
her with means and, then; brought her
case to the attention of Messrs. Bige
low & Dorsey, the attorneys, who vol
unteered to defend her. ,_.
COUPLE RECONCILED.
In connection with her present rela
tions with- 1 her husband, Mrs. Madden
says she has not seen him since Sep
tember 6 last. She says. that when she
arrived here from Manila a few weeks
ago on' the transport Thomas she was
met at the dock by her husband's fath
er, who ushered her into -a cab and In
stalled her as a guest at the Occidental
Hotel. Hardly "had she taken off her
wraps, she claims, when she was serv
ed with the summons in divorce.
The order was Issued by Judge Heb
bard upon the reading of an affidavit
filed by Mrs. Madden, in which she
avers that but for the sum of 540 ad
vanced her by a friend she is without
means or the wherewithal to enable
Tier to live in the style she is used to
as the wife of a captain in the regular
army, who earns, or rather receives,
$216 67 per month. Mrs. Madden says
that her husband can well afford to
pay her $100 a month, as in addition to
his salary he gets his quarters and
food free and has no need for more
than $40 a month to spend for inciden
tals.
Mrs. Madden's affidavit is a lengthy
document and contains many state
ments that do not redound to the cred
it of her soldier spouse. She also says
some unkind things about Jerome Mad
den, her father-in-law. She says all
her troubles are due to Madden senior;
that he is responsible for the attack
upon her reputation. At least, she says
that she is informed and believes that
Jerome Madden caused to be filed the
action in divorce. She says he controls
Captain Madden; that he hired the at
torneys who represent her husband and
that he caused to be brought the
charges that .would blast her reputa
tion as a good woman and a true and
faithful wife.
MAY FILE COUNTER CHARGE.
Continuing, she says that she in
tends to wage a bitter fight in defense
of her honor and will prove ere the
case is finished that she has been a
much maligned woman. She will prove,
she says, that Madden has ever since
his marriage at Fort McPherson, Ga.,
in April, 1898, forgotten on many occa
sions his marriage vows. In this coun
try and the Philippines, says Mrs.
Madden, her husband has on many oc
casions forgotten j his marriage vows.
She will prove this, she avers, by the
testimony of his fellow-officers and
others acquainted with the doings of
Madden. ' : ";Â£;
Captain John F. Madden, regimental
adjutant of the Twenty-ninth Infan
try, U. S. A.; learned yesterday that
there Is a vast difference between car
rying on warfare in the divorce court
and doing battles along lines laid 'down
by Uncle Sam'a instructions at West
Point.
This fact was impressed upon him
by Judge Hebbard in an order direct
ing him to provide Edith Madden, the
woman from whom he Is seeking: a di
vorce on the ground of Infidelity, with
the sinews of war. In other words, he
has to furnish her with the means to
wage battle against him, to support
herself while the battle for freedom,
from irksome matrimonial bonds is on
and to enable her to provide the evi
dence . she claims she can secure to
show that she is blameless, and that
her husband is the one at fault; that
he and not she is the one who forgot
the promise to remain faithful.
The order made by Judge Hebbard
provides that within the next five days
the. gallant captain must pay over to
Mrs. Madden the sum of $200, half of
which is to be used for counsel fees and
the procurement of evidence needed by
Mrs. Madden to refute her husband's
charges and the other half to enable
her to provide herself with the neces
saries of life. The ord^r also commands
that Madden shall on the 6th of each
succeeding month during the pendency
of the action pay her $100. Until the
order Is complied with â¢ Madden must
take no further steps in the case.
SAYS SHE IS DESTITUTE.

"When Captain Finch of the Occidental and

the schooner Andy Mahoney wltlT provisions
he included a number of delicacies for the
wife and children of Captain Anderson, the
skipper of the hungry nailing vessel. The own

Steamship Company for the provisions and
thanked Captain Finch for his kindness. The
Gaelic met the Andy Mahoney in mid-ocean

While on the tour of inspection
Schweinhard says that his companions
and himself went into a Pacific-street
saloon to have a drink. He ordered
whisky and after drinking it he became
aware of a dizzy sensation and soon
found consciousness deserting him.
After that, he claims, he knew nothing
until the following" morning, when he
awakened in the Xew Avenue lodging
house, sick and still stupefied. He then
iound that his wallet, in which he car
ried $62S, had been taken from his
pocket during his slumber and *.he
money extracted. It was in paper,
with the exception of a couple of pieces
of gold. The empty wallet had been"
replaced in his pocket.
Upon questioning the l?ndlord he
learned that he had been taken to the
place by a m^n who had the appear
ance of a Spaniard. This man secured
the room for him and escorted him to
After that his supposed friend left
him and no more was heard of him.
Captain Martin is making a thorough
inquiry into Schweinhard's story, but
has not yet given out a report on it.
A week ago Monday Mrs. Schwein
hard called at police headquarters and
stated that her husband had not been
at his home since Saturday. An inves
tigation was had and it was found that
the real estate man had said he was
going to San Mateo on the afternoon
he disappeared, but all trace of him
was lost after that. Tuesday Schwein
hard appeared at his home suffering
from the effects of drugs and related
the story of the robbery. He said that
he had told a friend to telephone to his
wife that he had been suddenly called
to San Mateo and that he went there,
returning next day. Instead of going
immediately home he met two men in
his office who desired to purchase sa
loon property and he escorted them to
the neighborhood of Kearny and Pa
cific streets to look at a place that was
for sale.
Schweinhard called upon Captain of
Detectives Martin and solicited his aid.
At the time Martin had Detective T. J.
Coleman at work in an effort to dis
cover the whereabouts of the real es
tate man. his wife having reported his
disappearance a couple of days before.
Martin has since followed up the case.
G. W. Schweinharrt. a well known
real estate dealer, with offices at 1031
Market street, tells tie police a tale
of drugs and robbery on Barbary
Coast. He claims that he was taken
into a saloon and after one drink
lapsed into unconsciousness. When he
awakened some time later he found
himself in a near by lodging-house and
discovered that ?C28 had been stolen
from him.

STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 24. â A destructive on
slaught en the t-tocks of a number or industrial
corporatiuos un-ettl?d the etock market to-day
and turned the course of prices downward after
tsome ktaow of rt-dlMance in the standard stock*.
The advances ia the latter which were made
yesterday in faoe of similar unsettling Influ
ences ifncouragei some buying In that quarter
this morning. Orders for London account
were conspicuously In evidence, a new stock
account having opened there to-Jay. Hut
Southern ITlcific. which was the sustaining In
fluence yesterday and In which the principal
speculative influence was noticeable, was sold
to take Â£>rofits, and this served to damjicn en- !
thuslasm over Oe whole market. The rise of
1*4 in Sugar, which waÂ« mostly lout afterwara, i
represented the \letrs of speculators over the j
outlook for the Cuban treaty. The average '
level of Trices wÂ»s a traction over last night
at one time, in sympathy with this and a few !
ether special mo\mn'nts. The acute demorali
zation Jn lndustnais and specialties checked
any evider^ctr elsorhere, but the principal weak
ness in. the. Keoecel- market div.it.-XK.il alter tb*
fpeclaJtles had kx-ea relieved from pressure and
Â¦when the call lean rate ran up to Â« j>er cÂ«-nt.
the hijihest of tae season. It was then that
a number of sttadard railroad stocks ran off
to about a poii.t under last n!i;ht. They
steadied again f.c<] the closing waa ilightly
irregular and dolL It was asserted on thÂ«
'- floor of the istoctt Exchante that the collapse
jn sperlaltiec v.as enclneered by a party of
proteselocal trad-rs for effect on the ecneral
market. Whate". er the cause of the break, it
was clear that a very vulnerable portion was
uncovered. Loss>Â« of 12^ in Cora -Products
preferred, 4'i In the common. 8 In locomotive
preferred, 4^Â« In Car preferred, 2 in the com
mon, 3^Â« In Leather preferred, 3 in flag pre
lerred and from 1 to 2 In various others are I
auffi< lent evidence of public^distrunt of values.
In the case of Corn Product* it was alleged
' that formidable mw competition uaa preparing.
General considerations played a part In the de
cline, such aa comparisons with the urice of
the United States Steel stocks in the Industrial
class. It was pointed out that the absorption
at hlerh valuation of competing plants was
proving to be an Invitation to the organization
of new Â©oro petition for industrial corporations.
Assertions that the present level of prices for
sterl products Â«ai merely tentative and was
likeiy to give way to further reductions played
a part In to-day's market. The resumption of
the hearings in the United StatÂ»s Shipbuilding
suit seemed to be considered a fitting occasion
for an onslaught tpon industrial securities In
general. Â¦ As a more specific cause a number
of loans in which these stocks figured as col
lateral were said t> have been peremptorily
called and the collateral thrown on the mar
ket. This Â«erves t> explain the flurry' In the
money market. Sterling exchange responded to
this development vHh a sharp drop, and the
fencing tactics between London and New York,
by which the former seeks to protect her gold
supply, were renewed. Announcement was
made, however, of tn engagement of $1,000,000
In gold for Import .'or account of a Boston In
stitution. Upward of a half million In gold
previously engap-d arrived by an Incoming
steamer and went into bank reserves.

J. -H. Jones, of Chico. a heavy handler of
Hay . in the north. Bald yesterday that he
looked for a Hay situation this year similar to
that of 1S97-US, when Hay ran up to fancy
prices. He said that there was no surplus Hay
In the northern part of the State, and that
Oregon ami Washington could not supply this
market as they dhl In those years; furthermore,
that other sections which shipped In to Califor
nia then to relieve the scarcity here are this
year calling on California for supplies, so he
looks for a scantily supplied and strong market
the rest of tho season.

BOSTON. Mass.. Nov. 24. â Dullness haa
been the chief feature cf the wool market the

that when heavy-weights are opened the ten
dency will be to buy more wool as business
warrants. The market for both fleece wools
and Territory wools is quiel. No chanKCR ore

although there was little Improx-ement In the
volume of trade. The Impression prevailed
among traders that too much has been finding
Its way Into the hands of a bull operator and
as the crowd In general was short, there' was
a rood demand from this source throughout the
day. . Outside markets - were higher, the .' re
ceipts at Duluth and Minneapolis being Â¦Â¦ espe
cially strong, which influenced prices here.
May was In better demand than December.- and
opened a shade to %@^c higher at 78 H@>
78%C and advanced gradually as the day pro
gressed. Advices from Argentina state that
the exportable ' surplus will be much less than
at first estimated and this fact had a.* strength
ening , Influence during the- latter * part , of the
session. The close .was :s@lc higher at "O'-gc.

The lad and the man with hands on his knees,
As shown in the sketch, are like as two peas.
The youngster looks up to the darkly garbed sage
And gives the respect that is due to ripe age.
The man tells the boy, who is eager of brain.
That the way to success is open and plain;
That in every line of business life.
To get a fine job, to find a good wife, .
To hire men or girls who will orders obey
And give cheerful service by night or by day.
The best of results from ads large or ads small
Are certain as death if the ad's In The Call.

' "We have here a problem of cutting
a canal through a mud bank for a
short distance. It is apparently easy
enough to remove the quantity of mud
estimated, but will the banks hold up
under the pressure of that weight?
We think not. Then piles driven to
solid ground is our only means of safety
for a permanent passageway through
this portion. Actual tests show that in
the mud of the Nicaragua Lake it Is
400 feet to solid bottom.
"Piles 150 feet long may bo had in
Oregon, you may say, and the stability
of the 'deeper mu4, under pressure, is
presumably sufficient to hold the piles
in place. Well and good if It was here
or in a country like this, but Nicaragua
is a volcanic country and what would
become of a canal if it be cut across
a mud bank 400 feet .deep when the
whole bank was set trembling by a
temblor? How long would It be before
the piling would be not only thrown
out of line, but be actually floating on
the surface of the water? There you
have the reason for De Lesseps cutting
through that hill, where the Chagres
floods are the only Inconstant factor
in the whole scheme."
With reference to a long-standing
contention as to the : respective geo
logical fitness of Nicaragua and Pan
ama as the site for the trans-isthmian
canal, Joseph Voyle, an engineer, resid
ing In Berkeley, learned some interest
ing facts while on a visit to the East
several years ago. He says that the
Nicaragua site is a mud deposit and

THE SAVED AND. MISSING.
MOBE SUBVTVOBS COMING.
All hope of there being more j than
thirteen survivors of the wreck of the
Francois Coppee has departed. Four
days have passed since the lifeboats
left the bark, and It is no longer con
sidered possible that any of the. eleven
men still missing could either- have
reached the shore alive or managed to
stay afloat in the turbulent sea.
Not until yesterday was the wreck
definitely located. Captain Jorgenson
and his crew of life savers from the
station about' six miles north of Point
Reyes arrived at the scene Monday
evening, but owing to the dense fog
then prevailing they could not see fifty
yards away. Â¦ They found the ,, wreck
yesterday morning, however, and Jor
genson immediately sent the following,
dispatch to the Weather Bureau In this
city; . '
"Bark Francois Coppee. is wrecked at
Pierces Point, - Bird Island, 200 yards
off shore, one mile south of entrance to
Tomales Bay. " Thirty feet of starboard
bow visible at- low tide. Masts Â¦ gone.
Vessel probably broken in two.'.'
Jorgenson left a patrol on the beach,
with Instructions to look out for bodies
coming ashore, but at a late hour last
night none had been reported. Quanti
ties of wreckase were . washed land
ward, however, and the few folk on the
beach rescued clothing,' casks" of wine,
cognac and [ other stuff. At Bodega,
ten miles north of where the Coppee
struck, considerable wreckage came
ashore. ' 'Â¦' ' - V â¢
The Oakland was badly damaged by
the collision. The front rails on the
side where she struck were all torn off
and one of her davits and a lifeboat
were completely wrecked. The Bay City
was but slightly damaged, as the full
force of the collision seemed to have
been felt by the Oakland.
A wild stfene on the decks followed.
The shrill cries of women could be
heard above the harsh> gruff commands
cf the officers and the frightened tones
of many of the male passengers, who
ran wildly about the decks or Into the
cabins seeking a place of safety.
Several women passengers I tainted
outright, while others ran about
screaming wildly, begging of the men
to save them. Others sat down on
benches and cried for fear; nor could
their fears be calmed till they were
landed Eafely on the Oakland mole.
Finally the Oakland was brought to
a standstill. Her master gave orders
to back her out into the stream again.
It was Beveral minutes before the boat
finally made the slip. She barely
crawled along and felt her way in amid
the thick fog. While ehe was entering
the fears of many passengers were
again aroused, and whenever her sides
came in contact with the piles sur
rounding the landing place It was a
general signal for hysterical screams
from the thoroughly frightened women
passengers. ...:.'.-
PANIC ON" THE DECKS.
When the Oakland struck she shiy
ered all over. People were thrown out
of their -Â»t^ts, and for a moment the
big boat was unsteady, and from her
wobbly motion many of her more timid
passengers were led to believe that 6he
T.-as about to Gink.
As the speed of the Oakland began
to slacken slightly the Bay City loomed
up grimly not twenty-five feet away.
It could be seen distinctly by those who
were standing on the Oakland at the
time. Some one shouted, "We are go
ing to strike; look out." The engines
were reversed with all possible speed
at the command of the captain, but too
late, for in another second the Oakland
went crashing Into the Bay City.
The big craft did not 6eem to slacken
its sDeed in the least and those who
knew the slip well had an inkling that
ail >-as not right, for the tones of the
fog bell came from south of the boat
instead of directly in front.
PAESEKGEES HAVE FEAES.
The murky fog that hung over the
bay all day made it impossible to dis
tinguish an object twenty feet in front
of the boat. Along the water line and
rising to a distance of about fifty feet,
the hazy cloak that enwrapped itself
over the water made navigation on the
bay not only difficult but dangerous.
The Oakland was a few minutes
ahead of her regular schedule when
the collision happened. A large ma
jority of the passengers were standing
on the front deck, waiting for the boat
to land. It was impossible to discern
an object twentj' feet atray, yet the
solemn clang of the fog bell at the
entrance to the slip told those on board
that the boat was about to dock.
The boat was running at a. high rate
of Fpeed when the acciaent occurred,
notwithstanding the fact that the com
pany claims the fog schedule was
strictly adhered to. Berore the Oak
land ran afoul of the Bay City many
were commenting on the high rate of
speed which the boat was making and
a general query on the decks was why
the captain did not slow down.
As the ferry-boat Oakland was try
ing to steam into her slip at the Oak
land pier on her 2:30 o'clock trip yes
terday afternoon she went crashing
into the ferry-boat Baj- City, lying in
the adjoining slip. The fog was so
dcr.se that the captain of the Oakland
lost his bearing* and ran his boat Into
the wrong mooring place. When the
big ferry-boat struck she shivered from
bow to stern. Women went into hys
terics and many fainted; men rushed
wildly about and during the few in
tensely exciting moments that^ensued
an awful panic was narrowly averted,
for the crew of the huge passenger
boat feared the danger as much as the
passengers and were powerless to act
for the time being.
Luckily the boat carried but few pas
sengers at the time she struck, other
wise many would eurelj- have lost their
lives in the fierce scramble that fol
lowed. Some rushed forward, others
ran into the cabins seeking shelter,
while many Btood on the decks, too
much terror-stricken to move and ren
dered speechless from abject fear.

-. The case of Sergeant ' Reuben
A. Wolf was then taken up and depo
sitions made in Los Angeles by
S..E. Bisbee, N. J. Powell, Frank H.

John B. Morrison, Sylvester P. Hens

F. Dishman, F. M. D. Spencer, George
Brown, F. J. Williams, John Hauer
waas, Joseph M. Cota and H. H. Appel
were read.
All the depositions showed that the
reputation of George B. Simpson, the
saloonkeeper who accuses Wolf of hav
ing taken money from him, is bad and
that Simpson was engaged in* several
shady transactions and conducted a
saloon of a highly notorious character.
Simpson took the stand and stated
that, with the exception of three, all
the persons who made depositions were
his personal- enemies. One, S. E. Bis
bee, Simpson said was his half-brother
and that he had served a term of five
years In " Sing Sing penitentiary. He
refused to tell of .his trouble with ex-
Sheriff Gard or to state the reason why
the latter should be his enemy. This
was so in relation to several of the oth
er persons .who made depositions. The
case was then submitted and a decision
will be rendered next Tuesday night.
A rule was passed by the Police Com
missioners "bt a meeting. last evening
that prevents members of the depart
ment from borrowing money on their
salary warrants or from selling or as
signing such to any person or corpora
tion. The rule is. to go into effect im
mediately and will be embodied In the
police manual. It is as follows:
