NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â Mary Shaw, the

Henrich Ibsen, the Danish dramatist, in
response to a cablegram which Miss
Shaw recently sent to him condoling with
him on his ill health. Ibsen in this let
ter accepts his correspondent's condo
lences, but adds that the reports that he
is in ill health emanate from his enemies,
the truth being that he is In better health
than he has been for many months. Ib
sen says also that he is at work on a new
drama, which he hopes will take even
higher rank than his "The Doll's House."
His advanced age, he says further, is all
that prevents him from visiting America,
which he would like very much to do.

SULTAN SEES EMBAS3ADORS,
Regrets Turkish. Excesses and Says
Peace Is in Sight.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Sept. 20.â In an
audience with M. Zlnnovieff, the Russian
Embassador, on Friday, the Sultan ex
pressed .his regret at the excesses com
mitted by the Turkish troops In the vll
ayets of Monastir and Adrianople. He
said that orders had been sent to the au
thorities concerned to prevent their repe
tition, and he gave the Russian Embas
sador to understand that the guilty, per
sons would be punished.
. The German Embassador, Baron Mar
shall von Bleberstein,- also had an audi
ence with the Sultan, who showed him
self most optimistic. The latter declared
that the insurrection was drawing to a
close: In fact It already had been sup
pressed in some districts, and the Porte,
therefore, would immediately issue proc
lamations announcing the resumption of
the application of the reform scheme.
After the granting of these audiences
an extraordinary council of Ministers
was held at Tildiz Kiosk, and the deliber
ations were continued on Saturday. It
is understood that the council drew up
fresh instructions to the valis on the
line of his Majesty's declarations.
Official dispatches from the vails of Sa
lonica, Monastir and Adrianople report
numerous encounters which resulted in
favor of the Turks.

LONDON. Sept. Zl.â The Balkan situa
tion presents few features this morning.
The German Emnernr's influence in Vi
enna is said to have been thrown in favor
of allowing the Sultan the utmost free
dom - in suppressing the insurrection.
Both Turks and Macedonians claim vic
tories in the daily encounters. A report
from Sofia says that Bulgaria's military
preparations are reaching the stage of
perfection that will enable the concentra
tion of 200.COO men on the frontier within a
week, and the stocks of provisions, weap
ons and ammunition are rapidly becoming
efficient.
According to a dispatch from Constan
tinople to the Daily Telegraph, the Sultan
is so firmly resolved to avoid a war that,
on the report that France was sending a
fleet to Turkish waters, and again when
it was stated that Bulgaria was mobiliz
ing, he drafted a decree forbidding mas
sacres In Macedonia and conferring
more extensive local administrative
privileges than had been demanded
by the insurgents tnemselves; but.
on each occasion, finding the rumors
unfounded the decree was rescinded. It
is believed, however, that should any
power threaten a demonstration In Turk
ish waters the decree will be signed.
The Sofia correspondent of the Dally
Telegraph gives a similar report that the
Sultan la readv to concede local auton
omy, but will not grant a Christian Gov
ernor to Macedonia. Instead, he would
propose a mixed commission, composed of
Turks, Macedonians, Bulgarians. Greeks
and Wallachians, to administer the
provinces.
The Servian newspapers are discussing
the probability of a reconciliation with
Bulgaria, on the basis of free trade be
tween Servla and Bulgaria and a de
fensive aluance against the Turks.

Â«. OFIA, Sept. 20.â Some apprehen-
B sion apparently having been cre-
B ated, owing to a misunderstanding
*JJ regarding the precise meaning of
Bulgaria's last note to the pow
ers, explanations have been given 'to
some diplomatic agents here that the
memorandum was not intended as an ulti
matum, but was rather in the nature ot
an appeal for the intervention of the
great powers before that intervention
should be too late. The Bulgarian Min
istry, it was stated, was determined to
maintain its attitude of neutrality up to
the last moment, but it feels the impos
sibility of standing by indefinitely while
the Turks exterminate the Bulgarian ele
ment in Macedonia.
The Government's position is rendered
Increasingly difficult by the attitude of
the Macedonia population In Bulgaria,
which, vigorously backed up by the rev
olutionary committees, is persistently en
deavoring to force the Government's hand
and provoke hostilities with Turkey.
A special dispatch from. the monastery
of Rlla, Bulgaria, says the condition of
the Turkish garrison of Molnlk, sixty-five
miles northeast of Salonica, is believed to
be extremely critical. It is besieged by
bands of insurgents under the leadership
of Yankoff, Stoyanoff, Davinghoff and
Zografoff, all of whom, were formerly
Bulgarian officers. The Insurgents num
ber 1500, while the garrison is believed to
consist of only one battalion. Melnik Is
a very important strategic point in the
mountains, commanding the road between
Demir-Hassar and Razlog. The Turks
have withdrawn nearly all their forces
from, the districts of Danaoumana and
Razlog to send to the relief of Melnik.
As a consequence unusual tranquillity
prevails throughout the district of Raz
log, where the authorities, lacking the
support of the troops, have ceased their
policy of . persecution and the beys are
even- supplying bands with food. The
Turkish population is described as being

NEW YORK, Sent. 20.â In the center of
a cordon of snarling lions at Bostock's.
Coney Island, to-day the christening of
the three weeks old baby of Harry Tudor
of West Eighth street, Coney Island, took
place. The crying of the child seemed
to enrage the beasts and the trainer had
to put his powers to the supreme test to
control them while the strange jungle
christening was going on.
Captain Bonavlta drove twenty-seven
lions into the arena. They were in a par
ticularly ugly mood and for twenty min
utes it was a question whether the chris
tening would be possible. Peter the Great
made a rush at the trainer and was sub
dued only after a severe lashing.
As Mme. Morella, with the baby in her
arms, entered the band played "Amer
ica," and the great crowd, thrilled by the
spectacle. Joined in the chorus. The baby,
was dressed In a long gown made of a
combination of American and British
flags.
Just as Captain Bonavita stepped for
ward to officiate at the christening the
baby started to cry and this seemed to
have a strange effect upon the lions.
Peter the Great and a big lioness jumped
from their pedestals. By this time the
lions were roaring in chorus and among
the spectators a panic was barely averted.
Two women, overcome by the spectacle,
fainted and were carried out
When the lions were again subdued the
ceremony of christening was resumed and
went through without a hitch. The baby
was christened Isla.

influence against secessionist Ideas, not

which fact engaged for him the sympa

is a part of a general plan, the result of

RESDEN, Sept. 2O.-Herr Bebel
m g has re-established his authority
M M in the Socialist party by carry
Â¦Â¦ ing his resolution against the re
visionists by several hundred
votes against eleven dissenting voices
and having elected an executive commit
tee of his own choosing. It now looks as
though the agitation against Herr Bebel
before the convention was encouraged by
him in order that his absolute leadership
of the party should be demonstrated and
the small faction opposed to him held up
to the ridicule of the party.
If the gold reserve of $150,000,090, which
tvas counted in the cesh balance prjor to
tne act of March It 1300. should be added
to this total it would bring the grand to
tal of the cash in the treasury, exclusive
of trust funds, up to S4SS,O73,E2&â more
than er.ough to have defrayed the gross
expenditures of the Government for the
entire fiscal year of ISSS and enough to
have run the Government for ten years
at the rate of expenditure In 1S50.
Strictly epeaking, the balance "is much
larger, for whenever any money is cred
ited to a United States disbursing of
ficer it is at once charged out as a liabil
ity and is deducted from, the cash bal
ance, though it may remain in the treas
ury for months. There are thus charged
out at the present time Sâ¬2,S1S,3O3 credited
to disbursing officers and S5.59S.344 cred
ited to the PostofSce Department account
to meet the current expenditures of the
i'ostal service.
If these two Items, which may be de-
Fcribed as a balance set apart for im

cash balance, as stated on the books,
they bring the total up to $30S.079,5M.

According to the plans in view by mem
bers of the Sanitary Board, the dam
will supply almost as much power as
Niagara Falls.
The work of building a dam on the
channels and the benefits to be derived
from it are of large proportions. The
board is planning on the use of a flow of
water amounting to 35,000 horsepower,
and will transmit this power to Chicago
and towns along the course of the canal.
It is the plan of the board to make use
of the power for electrical, illuminating
and other purposes.
The Legislature at its last session au
thorized the board to make such benefi
cial use of the waters of the channel as
it saw fit. After years of planning by
members of the board they decided upon
the water power.
CHICAGO, Sept. 20.â The business in
terests of Chicago, as well as of small
manufacturing towns along the drainage
canal, will be greatly benefited if the
plans of the Sanitary Board materialize.
The first step to bring this about was

President Palma urged the Cuban people

means of Intervention.
The Presidential party was enthusiasti

The Alcalde having remarked that the
gathering was composed of veterans,
President Palma assured them that he
wanted to pay the army as badly as any
body, because the payment was not only
an act of Justice but was necessary to the
reconstruction of the country. Nobody
loved Cuban Independence more than him
self, continued the President. The only
way to sacrifice the republic would be to
bring about a civil war. He believed
there was not one veteran in a thousand
who would not prefer to maintain the
honor of Cuba, even to the extent of for
feiting his soldier's pay. The Cubans
having accepted United States interven
tion as a means of ending their troubles
were under an obligation to follow those
ideals and prove themselves peaceable

Of this large sum of money sent out of
the country to purchase goatskins $7,000,
000 went to India, nearly $2,000,000 to
China, $2,500,000 to France, $1,500,00 to
Russia, $1,500,000 to Brazil, 51,000,000 to Ar
gentina and $1,000,000 to Arabia. From
India, which took less than $5,000,000 worth
of merchandise of all kinds from the
United States last year, and has increased
her purchases from us less than $2,000,000
In a decade, we have increased cur Impor
tations of goatskins alone from $2,000,000
In 1K*2 to $7,500,000 In 1S02. From Brazil,
which has reduced her imports from the
United States from $15,000,000 in 1835 to
$10,000,000 in 1903, our purchases of goat
skins last year were $1,500,000. France,
Russia, th<Â» United Kingdom, Turkey In
Europe and Turkey in Asia, Arabia,
China. Southern Africa, Argentina and
Mexico also contribute llberallv to the
supply of goatskins to make up the $25,-
Oi'O.OOO worth of this product brought into
the United States annually.
The farmers of the United States are
apparently making no effort to rtap any
part of this golden harvest ' for them
selves. The census of 1900 showed tho
total number of goats in the United
States to be less than 2,000.000, and when
it is understood that the skins of probably
20.OUO.000 goats were requirea to make the
$25,000,000 worth imported last year, it
would be seen that the supply from the
United States could have formed but a
small share of the . total consumption.
Yet the faot that a largo share of our
supply of this important import comes
from India, GhTna, France and Mexico,
suggests that there are large areas ill the
United States which might produce goats
successfully and in sufficiently largo
numbers to supply the entire home de
mand. - .
A statement just presented by the De
partment of Commerce and Labor,
through its Bureau of Statistics, shows
that importations of goatskins into the
United Slates are now running at the
rate of $25,000,000 per annum and that a
large share of these are brought from In
dia, China, Arabia and Southeastern Rus
sia. The increasing popularity of certain
classes of kid leather for footwear, as
well as gloves, has increased very greatly
the demand^for goatskins in the United

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET N.
W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 20.-A new in
dustry is offering itself to the farmers
and manufacturers of the United States.
The fact that $25,000,000 worth of goat
skins are now annually imported into the
United States, and that her enterprising
manufacturers are now obliged to send
halfway around the world for a large
share of them, suggests that the farmers
of the country have a great opportunity
to put a large share of this sum in their
own pockets, and that tho entire sum
may be divided between our producers
and manufacturers.

lf$L He was an enthusiastic athlete, be
ing especially fond of football "and polo.
During the ni&ht an operation was per
formed to relieve a ruptured blood vessel
near the brain. The operation, which
was performed at the country home of
the Swift family, Westleigh, in Lake
County, seemed to give relief, but the
effect was only temporary. The physi
cians worked over Swift until the end.
The ball which struck Swift was one
that went in the air and from the mallet
of Love. Swift did not appreciate his
danger until too latey-^lhe glare of the
eun preventing- him from following: the
ball in its flight. When the ball hit him
he did not fall from his saddle, and when
his. companions g-alloped to his side he
was at first Inclined to make lig-ht of the
injury. He was induced to dismount, but
â¢waiked without aid from the fleld. Arriv
ing home he complained of dizziness, and
later went Into a delirium.

Many Deaths Occur in Rail

MONTEREY. Mexico. Sept. 20.â Dr. Roy
Martin, quarantine inspector for the Gov
ernment, who recently returned from
Linares, declares that the city is dead
commercially and partly deserted on ac
count of tbe prevalence of yellow fever.
Although there are less than 200 fever
caBes in Linares, there are fully 2000 per
sons sick with various ailments.
Latest advices from Victoria state that
but twelve cases of yellow fever now ex
ist in that city.
W. H. Leonard, representative of the
bridge and masonry contractors on the
Monterey division of the Mexican Central
Railroad, reports a most deplorable situ
ation among the construction camps along
the line. He says that there is scarcely a
camp without yellow fever and that there
are many deaths.
Tamplco is largely diminishing the num
ber of cases of yellow fever.
LAREDO, Tex., Sept. 20.â This city still
maintains a vigorous quarantine against
Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Little news of a
reliable kind can be secured from across*
the river.
United States Consul Garrett, who ar
rived in Nuevo Laredo to-day after hav
ing passed five days in quarantine at San
chez station, stated that he had examined
several cases of the prevafltng disease
and declares they ara not yellow fever.
Expert bacteriologists of the Mexican
Governent have arrived and will investi
gate the cases in company with a yellow
lever expert, who is expected to arrive
from Washington to-morrow.
â¢ VIENNA, 1 Sept. 20.â Count Hedervary,
who placed his resignation as Hungarian
Premier in the hands of Emperor Francis
Joseph some time ago, had audiences with
the Emperor both yesterday and to-day,
which, it is rumored, have led to the solu
tion of the Hungarian Cabinet crisis, and
a Ministry will be formed either by Count
Julius Andrassy or Koloman Szell. Should
this news be. confirmed it will be due to
the correct and patriotic attitude of Fran
cis Kossuth and his party. Kossuth and
his party declared resolutely against any
thing in the shape of a revolution, and
even forbade any street demonstration on
the anniversary of his father's birthday.
\Itis understood that the semi-official
communication made yesterday, explain
ing away the unfavorable construction
placed in Hungary on the army order is
sued by the Emperor on September 11, will
be issued in the form of an imperial auto
graph rescript addressed to Count Heder
vary, and this proof that the Emperor did
not desire to ruffle Hungarian suscepti
bilities will be emphasized by another
imperial visit to Budapest as an indica
tion of his continued confidence and good
will.
low was in the company of a boy by the
name of Earl Sears, who lives en Six
teenth street, near Fruitvale avenue.
Dearborn took George to the County Jail
in Oakland, where he was cared for by
the matron, who gave the little waif a
bath and put him to bed. After a night's
sound sleep the boy told of his wander
ings for the last four days. He said that
on Tuesday his teacher, in the A second
grade at* the Washington Grammar
School in San Francisco, gave him 10
cents for going on an errand, and after
school was out he went to the ferry and
took the boat to Oakland. He says he
left tho train at Fruitvale avenue and
after playing around until dark went to
sleep in a field. In the morning he went
out the avenue and spent the day wan
dering around near the Hermitage. That
night he slept in a shed."
On Friday morning George came back
to the station and that night slept in a
field. On Saturday morning he met the
Sears boy and the two spent the day
"out camping." 'When night came the
Sears boy was afraid he would be pun
ished for staying away from home all
day; so they went down to the Fruit
vale station to sleep. They were found
there by Constable Dearborn, who took
young Sears home and then brought the
other runaway to the County Jail.
The little fellow's case will be placed in
the hands of the Associated Charities of
San Francisco, as the authorities have
not yet been able to locate the boy's
father, who,- as far as can be learned,
made no effort to find the runaway after
his disappearance last Tuesday afternoon.
The State from which there is the
least immigration is Louisiana. Â¦ Vermont

gratory Americans.
PARKER -WTLI. TAKE PART *
IN THE OHIO CAMPAIGN"
Hawaiian National Delegate Accepts
an Invitation to Stump State
for the Republicans.
HONOLULU, Sept. y.â Samuel Parker
has decided to accept an Invitation ex
tended to him by Senator Hanna and
General Charles Dick to take part in the
Ohio State campaign, and has cabled to
Republican headquarters at Columbus,
Ohio, to that effect.
"I am going," said Colonel Parker this
morning, "because I feel it an honor to
be asked to do so. When they send to a
man here, as far as Hawaii is, then he
ought to respond for two reasonsâbe
cause of the" personal honor in being in
vited and because of the honor to Ha
waii. It should help our Territory and
our peo*ple to become better known. Sen
ator Hanna told me, two years ago, that
he would send for me if he needed me,
and I promised to go if he did so. He
has not forgotten his promise then and
I intend to keep my word."
"How about the Governorship?"
"I don't want to be Governor." said the
Hawaiian national delegate. "My hands
are full now and I have as much as I
care to attend to. I'm quite satisfied to
Bee Georce Carter as Governor and am
not going to put up any light against
him."

CHICO, Sept. 20.â Business people ot
Chico were given a fire scare this even

in four places in the two story brick
building located in the central part of
the business district and occupied by A.
Helwig as a coffee and lodging-house.
The fire was extinguished so quickly by
the local tire . department that the evi
dence of its Incendiary origin was not
destroyed and in consequence Helwlg was
placed under arrest before the hose
streams were taken from the Interior of
the building.
Helwlg has nothing to say regarding
the charge of arson lodged against hlnv
by Chief Murphy. The fire was started
In two places on the second floor and
two on the lower. It is known that Hel
wlg was in the building alone at the time
of the fire. He had recently become an
gered at the owner of the building: on
account of being denied a lease. His
property in the building was fully in

KILLS HIMSELF AFTER
WOUNDING SON-IN-LAW
BUFFALO, Sept. 20.â James Mears, 70
years old, to-day fatally shot his son-in
law, Michael Crotty, 33 years old, and
then sent a bullet through his own brain.
Family quarrels were the cause of the
tragedy.
Mears a year ago deeded some property
to his daughter, Katherlne, stipulating
that she should not marry_ and that she
should provide for him until his death.
Katherlne was married to Crotty three
months ago. Recently affairs in the
household had not been running smooth
ly. Last Wednesday their domestic af
fairs were aired in the Police Court. Crot
ty, who had been arrested on a warrant
secured by the old man for assault, was
discharged.
To-day while Crotty and his wife were
In the dining-room Mears came Into the
room and the quarrel was renewed. Crot
ty was standing at the window, when
Mears stepped up behind him and began
shooting. He fired twice, both bullets en
tering Crotty's back. Mrs. Crotty at
tempted to disarm her father, but he
brushed her away and sent a bullet Into
his own brain.

HAWAIIAN COURT IMPOSES
BATHER UNIQUE SENTENCE
IMrects Petty Offender to Singr a Song
and Dunce the Hula for
Punishment.
HONOLULU. Sept. 13.â To sing a song
and dance a hula was the penalty inflicted
upon an offender in a court of Justice at
Kona. on the island of Hawaii. Accord-
Ing to the story, a man appeared before
Judge Kaai a short time ago charged
with a statutory offense. The woman In
the case refused to give evidence against
the defendant. As she was the "principal
witness for the prosecution the case
agraJnst the defendant was rather shaky.
Still further, the fellow was not blessed
with worldly goods, bo that no fine could
be got out of him. To satisfy the require
ments of justice In a way to fit the crime
and still not be too hard on the offender,
the court imposed a unique sentence. The
defendant was to sing a song and dance
a hula outside of the courtroom. This was
accordingly done to the satisfaction of
the complainant, the court, the defend
ant and every one eleo concerned.
GARRISON III CRITICAL CONDITION
Then came the disclosure of the hoax.
The railroad company which started the
trouble sent out a statement that it
would give round trip tickets for those
dollars or any old dollars, provided
enough of them were received In ex
change. Now every man in Davenport is
denying that he cherished the coins,
while those who refused big prices for
their silver are industriously kicking
themselves.
Then the trouble began. Everybody in
the town began to take note of dollar
dates and persons holding the coins witn
the magic 1894 refused as high as jit
for them. The bank was besieged with
people seeking change In silver, despite
the fact that the bankers assured their
patrons that they knew nothing of an
extra value being placed on these dol
lars. Small boys sat on the bank steps
and hungrily watched the rush of busi
ness speculating on what persons had
drawn out the lucky coins. The rumor
grew and grew and the rush for silver
eclipsed Bryan's ratio of 16 to 1.
SPOKANE, Wash., Sept. 20.â A mighty
scramble for silver dollars of the mintage
of 1S94 has been in progress at Daven
port, Wash., for' more than a week and
only ended when the citizens discovered
that a big hoa* was being perpetrated.
Recently a railroad company announced
that It would give free trips to the St.
Louis fair in exchange for silver dollars
minted at San Francisco In 1S91. Some
wag started the report in Davenport that
only 306 dollars were minted and they
were nearly all shipped to a Davenport
bank.

Senator Burton of Kansas Is reliably
quoted as having stated to Senator For
aker of Ohio that the Gher interests had
practically bribed the Hawaiian Territo
rial administration In the matter of the
Kohala water franchise, so that other
competitors for the franchise had no
chance. Burton's statements were made
In a letter to Foraker, it is reported, and
the Senator from Ohio at once commu
nicated the charge to H. B. Gher, with
the result that the'latter Is starting an
Investigation. Burton's charges Included
Governor Dole, tho Boyds and the.mem
bers of the Executive Council generally.
The Senator from Kansas will have to
answer for them now, says Gher, and he
is therefore preparing as a starter to
have the matter investigated. In talking
of the matter Gher said:
The statement is madÂ« that I bribed thÂ«
whole Hawaiian Government and now we will
*ee what there is in It. I wrote an answer
to Senator Burton's ntateraents at once- and
furntahed the Governor a copy of it. The in
vestigation will reach further than those Inter
ested may think, and possibly there will be
eome suits -for criminal libel .before we get
through. I shall go into the question as com
pletely an I went Into. the Kohala forests to

Boyd and other officials were heavily inter

had a representative before the Executive

under salary. We will .find out all about it

Campbell, one of the game wardens of
Luzerne County, to-day shot and proba
bly fatally wounded Roman Dales, aged
35 years, near Campbells Lodge, two miles
Trom Plttston.
Several foreigners of late have been vio
lating the game laws, especially on Sun
day. Campbell, with other officers, found
five men to-day prowling around the
woods with guns. He notified them, to
leave, which they refused to do. An at
tempt was made to put Dales under ar
rest, and the latter raised his* gun to
shoot. As he did so Campbell seized the,
weapon. . It was discharged in the scuf
fle, the contents tearing Campbell's cloth
ing.
Both men fell to the ground. Dales
made an attempt to reload the gun,
whereupon Campbell drew his revolver
and in a second struggle Dales was shot,
the ball striking him in the back. The
prisoner, after being wounded, grappled
again with the officer and showed fight
until he was overpowered by the other
officers, who came to Campbell's relief.
Campbell surrendered to the Authorities
and gave ball for a further hearing on
Tuesday morning. The four other hunt
ers, all foreigners, are under arrest.

Curry has many friends in the country
through which he Is passing, and they
will aid him to reach the rendezvous of
his eansr, where he -will be safe in the
fastnesses of the Bear Paw mountains
from pursuit or capture. When last heard
from on Saturday he was only ten miles
from his destination ana well mounted.
As the posses got startea only this after
noon, the chances are all in Curry's favor.

who was killed by "Kid" Curry before
the Great Northern hold-up of two years

killed by Curry because the latter feared
he would betray the Curry gang. In spite
of this young Landusky is known as a
warm friend and adherent of Curry. His
promiscuous purchase of cartridges and
the fact that the posses are in search of
Curry lead to the opinion that the outlaw
has reached the members of his gang In
the Bear Paw Mountains and that all are
preparing to give their pursuers a warm
reception.

COLUMBUS, Ohio. Sept. 20.â The Em

was participated in by Irish-Americans
from all sections of Ohio. It is estimat
ed that 23,000 excursionists were brought
into the city. There was a parade early
in the afternoon of Irish societies. About
3000 men were in line. Following the pa
rade there was a mass meeting at the

of welcome were delivered by Governor
Nash and Mayor Jeffrey.

Â¦we hold to be of preater Importance than the

CHICAGO. Sept. 2O.-At the First Regi
ment Armory to-night a huge meeting un
der the auspices of the United Irish So
cieties of Chicago adopted a resolution de
claring that no settlement of the Irish
question short of national Independence
would satisfy the aspirations of the Irish
people. The occasion for the gathering
was the one hundredth anniversary of the
execution of Robert Emmet, and the reso
lution was emphatic that no Ireland
would satisfy men of Irish blood but the
Ireland for which Emmet diedâ Ireland a
ration free and independent, making her
own laws, floating her own flag, sharing
her own fortunes, acknowledsing alle
giance to no power outside the limits with
which nature has bounded the island.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolutions were passed declaring the
only proper settlement of the- differences
between Ireland and England to be the
sbo'ition of English rule in Ireland and
pledging the Clan-na-Gael to work for
the establishment of an Irish republic.
The orator of the evening was former
I'nited States Senator Charles A. Towne
of Minnesota, Towne pictured the scene
of Emmet's death, which he declared waa
one of the most pathetic tragedies in all
history.
"It is a hopeful spectacle." he said,
"for the man is the incarnation of an
Idea, arid that, please God, nothing can
ever km."
The Academy of Mu.Â«ic was filled to
overflowing by a meeting held under the
auspices of the Clan-na-Gael to commem
orate the centenary of the martyrdom of
Robert Emmet.
The oration of the evening was made
by John K. FIncrty of Chicago. American
president of the I'nited Irish League. The
thn.e things that caused the failure of
Emmet's rising, he said, were careless
ness, treachery and inebrity. and he
added: "Any Irishman, who on a mission
for his country gets drunk, deserves to be
frhot."
In a speech eulogizing Emmet. Robert
Emmet O'Dor.nell offered resolutions call
ing attention to the land bl'.l victory and
i hanked tlie 1'nitod Irish league for its
work in that direction and pledged the
sympathy and active support of American
Irish to the festering of the principles of
Rorert Kmmet and the fruition of his
ideals. The vote was taken by rising.
Toma? Estrada Palma. son of the Cu
ban President, was oa the platform with
his American wife. Young Pa'.rr.a was in
troduced and acknowledged the honor
with a brief speech.
"I can only offer my sympathy and that
of the Cuban peop'.e to the Irish nation
in its oppression." the Cuban said. "I
hope some day thai Ireland will take its
place among the independent nations of
the world along with my own beloved
country."
William Temple Emmet, a great-great
nephew of the Irish martyr, was present,
as Theodore Wolf Tone Maxwell.
grandson of Wolf Tone. The members
of the family of Thomas Addis Emmet
were also present. Rev. Charles Mc-
I'rfaJy presided. â¢

CHICAGO, Srpt. 20.â President Roose- !
velt to-day was voted by the Chicago
Federation of Labor a 9000-word letter of
advice. In which fault is found with the
President's attitude on the question of
fpen shons. The letter was prompted by
the decision of President Roosevelt in the
Miller case, in which the President said
that Miller or arry other man must not be
discharged from the Government print
ing ofiite 0:1 account of non-membership
in a union.
"Oeliciouply unaware of the hypocrisy of
i iirÂ» world of finance." "honest and hu
jnaoe, but uninformed." were two of the
Â« !au?es used to describe the President in
t'ie long letter of the open-shop com
rr.itte^. â¢
it? opening paragraphs contained a def
inite disclaimer of any wish to attack Mr.
Itocsevelt. thy blame for the chief execu
tive'* attitude in the Miller affair being
placed oii a "coterie of certain well
known interests which are constantly on
puard around the White House." The
President was told that he fell into error
iii his view of the question, "because of
that impetuosity for which we love
you."
A copy of the communication will be
forwarded to Oyster Bay at or.ce. under
â¢late of Labor day, September 7. The read
irj; of the letter before the federation
meeting to-day occupied mote than an
. hour and excited applause from the
crowd of delegates.
Suspecting foul play, he started a
search, but no trace of the missing man
could be found for some time. Finally tha
son found where the earth had apparently
been disturbed and a fire built over the
'mound to divert attention. Digging down
several feet at this point the body was
uncovered. The son at once rode to
Prlnevllle to notify the Coroner and
Sheriff before removing the corpse from
the ground.
Donkel and his son were camped on the
banks of the Dechutes River and were
engaged in putting up hay. The son left
ten days aÂ£o on a cattle round-up and
when he returned on Monday says he was
surprised to find that his father had dis
appeared.

to repair the damage. The Massachusetts

shows that transverse frames ar.d longi

much, labor to the inner botcom and
cause an expense of about $100,000. The
famous cruiser Olympia is in dock at Nor

for a distance of ninety-six fleet along the
starboard bottom and for forty-five feet
en the port bottom. The repairs to the
Scorpion at the New York navy yard,

It will be seen that upon this theory Nome be

It will be perceived that the theory requires for its
maintenance a proof that wherever gold is found
there has once been a tremendous ice cap, but that
does not disturb the author. He says: "Take region
after region, and by studying thoroughly their for

existence you shall see in what places alternately
through the ages the poles were situated; where once
the central ice cap rested; how from the central mass

In explanation of the method by which the gold
production is carried on beneath the Arctic ice cap
he says: "Slowly and surely the ice cap is grinding
along, crashing and shifting rocks and strata with
indomitable force. .AH at once it strikes a spark,
which catches in the imbedded and compressed layers

trees, pulps of all sorts, sulphurs, nitres, etc. The
substances are on fire. They burn, explode and then
smolder, explode and explode again. There is no
escape for the gases. The ice cap ever doubles them
back on the fire. Steadily fed by them the heat
grows stronger and stronger. With the upward
pressure of the heat the downward pressure of the'
indomitable ice ever increases. That is nature's for
midable smelter; none of the gases escape, but all
their virtues stay with the mass, which is in a con
tinuous state of chemical metamorphosis."
FP.OM Nome comes a pamphlet by Conrad Siem
setting forth a theory of the origin of gold,
which the author describes as "of particular in
terest to the people of Nome." In these days of sci
entific speculation it is also of interest to the general
public, since it furnishes what is at least a plausible
explanation of the method by which nature has pro
duced and continues to produce her golden ores.
Starting with the sound proposition that what na
ture has done once she is always doing, Mr. Siem
argues that the process by which gold was produced
in the past is going on continually and that new
stores of gold are being wrought out in the giant
laboratories of nature with an inexhaustible and un
ceasing energy. The particular interest which Nome
has in the theory is due to the fact that, according
to the author, the production of gold is always car
ritd on under glacial conditions, the precious metal
being the result of the fusion of elementary matter
by volcanic heat under the pressure of mighty ice
cap's.
Mr. Siem says: "We have evidence that gold grows.
Conceiving it as a product of time, as a produce of
nature's great laboratory that is ever actively refin
ing, may it not well be" that the best breeding and
producing grounds of gold are lying under these
very ice caps? The downward pressure of the ice
and the upward pressure of the earth are ever alike,
and with these titanic hammer and anvil nature forges
matter to the fineness of gold."
A geological argument too elaborate to be accu
rately summarized is advanced in the pamphlet to
maintain the thesis that Seward peninsula, jutting out
as it does between the frozen north and the Pacific,
bears the brunt of the conflict between those forces
which tend to spread Arctic condition^ downward to
the south and the counterbalancing forces that tend
to uphold the existing equilibrium. He says: "Over
its extent the ice of the Arctic and the warm waters
of the Pacific have fought for supremacy through
the ages. In periods it has been compressed and
depressed by towering mountains of ice, and in others
following the sea would wash clean over it from the
south. Whenever it became relieved from the over
bearing ice it would always gradually, rise, and rearing
its head high above the sea, would hold once more
the gate against the north."
ORIGIN OP- GOLD.
Emperor Francis Joseph has created a European
sensation by refusing emphatically to grant the de
mands of the Hungarian army. He is to be congrat
ulated that at least he has his national back yard be
tween him and the disgruntled generals. The death
of Alexander and Draga and the predicament of Peter
are lessons which monarchs learn without difficulty.
Local conditions remain unchanged. Times are
good both in the city and country, money is in ample
supply, collections are normal, there are no important
failures, the farmers are receiving first-rate prices for
their varied produce as a rule, real estate continues
actrve at good prices and both the domestic and for
eign trade of the coast are reported fine. Conditions
rould not be better if we made them ourselves. Pos
sibly they would not be so good.
The financial side of the commercial situation looks
well. Fall is upon us, the call for funds to move the
crops of the West has begun and thus far there is no
friction. Secretary Shaw has sent some of the inter
nal revenue money into the West to help things
along, and as the Western banks have been setting
aside funds for crop forwarding for some months the
calls on New York are fewer and for smaller amounts
than in former years. The West is growing more
able each succeeding year to furnish it* own funds
for sending the crops forward, but New York has
still the bulk of the burden, though the Western
banks have relieved the tension considerably this
year. Next year they will probably do even more in
this direction. The country's bank clearings made a
better showing last week, the loss from 1902 being
reduced from over 40 per cent for the preceding
week to 27.1 per cent as compared with 1002, with the
frains and losses about equally distributed among the
dozen or fifteen largest cities. The failures for the
week were 219, against 199 for the corresponding
week in 1002.
IF there was any distinctive feature to trade last
week it was the weather scare that swept over
the East and Middle West. Excessive rains
llooded the grain fields in a number of States where
the grain was in shock and prevented the final har
vesting in a great many important districts, the area
affected being 300.000.000 acres. To aggravate the
situation what aras ?aid to be the worst frost ever
known under similar crop conditions came along
about the same time, and what with the excessive
rains and widespread killing frost it looked for a day
or ;o as if the yields of both wheat and corn would
be very seriously diminished. This of course would
r^ean decreased railroad earnings and a correspond
ing depression in Wall street, less purchasing power
in the great area known as the wheat and corn belts,
a smaller demand for merchandise there and a con
traction of credits. Of course this has its effct on
stocks and general trade as well. Wall street paused,
awaiting developments. But happily the scare passed
over with far less damage than apprehended and by
Saturday the country was breathing easier again. A
bushel corn crop was practically asÂ«ured,
which means a great deal to the country. .
There was an unfavorable feature attendant upon
this reassuring news, however. It was a decline in
the stock market, where a buoyant tone had been con
fidently expected to follow the passing of the crop
scare, and it was a disappointment to the street. That
stocks should go down in the face of such a cheerful
reversion of conditions was not only bearish but
rather gloomy. It was the general opinion that the
public were selling to reaiize, especially as there was
a whisper floating about the street that the public
might look for the disintegration in the not distant
future of several large industrial syndicates put into
operation several years ago by certain large banking
interests. No names were mentioned, but the whis
per had its effect just the same, and the public sold
off the market, crop damage or no crop damage.
As far as distributive trade is concerned the best
reports now are from the Pacific Coast and the South
west. For a long time the Northwest sent in ex
cellent reports, but those from that quarter now are
deteriorating. Bad weather along the Atlantic Coast
has also given trade a temporary setback in that
Region. The manufacturing interests, however, re
port plants well employed as a rule. Even the tex
tile mills, which have for months been lagging be
hind, are now reporting the wheels going briskly.
Structural activity seems to be reviving somewhat
and the demand for lumber is reported good in most
sections. Iron and steel quotations continue weak,
with scattering recessions every few days, and the
mills report fewer orders on their books than at this
time last year, though the trade cannot be called dull
by any means. Provisions have received a check at
Chicago and the recent buoyancy there has been suc
ceeded by a quieter and easier market. The other
staples present no new features worthy of note.
BUSINESS GETS A CROP SCARE
The naval vessels comprising the fleet
in the recent German maneuvers con
sisted of seven battleships, four coast
defense ships, one armored cruiser, ten
cruisers and twenty-three torpedo di\is
ion boats. The latter, in' four divisions,
consisted of five boats, S. 91 and 96 built
in 1899, which were rated at 26*Â£ knots,
five boats at 27 knots and thirteen boats,
Just out of the builders' hands, having a
sea speed of 30 knots.
An interesting case has been decided in
the court martial of Captain Jacobson of
the German gunnery ship Freya. In No
vember last the shin, with the tender
Brummer, was practicing at sea and a
collision was narrowly averted through
the captain's order/ to shifts the helm.
Through this order trie responsiblity of the
Â¦watch officer, previously in command of
the ship, ceased, and shortly after when a
steamer came uncomfortably close to the
Freya, Captain Jacobson and the watch

The results of firing the 12-inch guns
of the French battleship Massena against
the turret of the Suffren are not yet suf
ficiently known to establish the value of
the experiment, nor has the object of the
trial been given out. The probable ob
ject was to ascertain whether the impact
of a shell against the turret would be
disastrous to the crew and if the turning
machinery would be damaged. The first
shell or armor-piercing projectile, weigh
ing 644 pounds or 750 pounds according to
its designation, was fired at short range
with a reduced charged which would give
the velocity of 5000 feet if fired at the
latter range with a full charge. The tur
ret of the Suffren, 10 inches thick, was
furtlfer reinforced by an additional plate
in wake of the locality to be hit, and the
projectile struck the spot fairly with no
visible damage to either the turret or the
sheep within, it. The second shot, fired
with an increased charge, jammed the
turret slightly, broke several electric light
wires within the turret, and wounded two
of the sheep. Pieces of the shell flew back
on the Massena without, however, hurt
ing anyone. This trial is by no means the
first of its kind, for a similar one took
place in the British navy In 1865 with the
turret ship Royal Sovereign, and again
In July, 1S72, when the 12-inch guns of the
Hotspur were fired against the turret of
the Glatton. The results then, as now,
pi*)ve that a well aimed shot is likely to
disable the turret either by disabling the
turning gear or by forcing the turret off
its center.
Four gunboats for the Chinese navy are
being built by contract at Kobe, Japan.
Bids were received from other countries,
but none were as low as the offer of the
Japanese. The boats are intended for
service on the Yangtse River, and are 180
feet in length, 23 feet beam and displace
525 tons on 7 feet draught. The engines
are of 950 horsepower, calculated to give
a speed of 13 knots.
the Good Hope, it is claimed,
made an average speed of 22^ knots for
several hours, far exceeding that of the
fastest cruiser in the fleet. It enabled
her to overhaul any vessel or escape from
any battleship too powerful to engage.
As to the lighter cruisers, a naval expert
asserts that they were often more of a
hindrance than a help, and expresses the
opinion that in . actual warfare it would
often be necessary to sacrifice them by
wholesale. The safest plan, he maintains,
would be to keep all of them, excepting
scouts and dispatch vessels, within reach
of fortified harbors until the heavier ves
sels have been disposed of in pitched bat
tles, when they would be of importance as
a reserve force.
The latest torpedo experiments on the
old Belleisle were chiefly to test the value
of American cellulose as a water-exclud
ing material. A compartment was fitted
on the outside of the hull, twenty feet
long, three feet deep and projecting two
feet from the side. This cofferdam was
located ten feet below the waterline and
packed tight with cellulose. When the
torpedoâ lashed to this compartmentâex
ploded, the top of the cofferdam blew off,
scattering much of the cellulose into
space and the test was therefore hardly
to be considered conclusive. A large hole
was blown throush the vessel and the
Bellisle settled down in shallow water.
The shin is again to be patched up and
subjected to further tests.
ONE of the results of the recent
British naval maneuvers was
to establish beyond a doubt
the great value of swift ar
mored cruisers. One of these.
Slowly but surely business principles
displace antiquated and irrational meth
ods in the Navy Department. The latest
improvement in that direction is contem
plated in the extinction of the so-called
Bureau of Equipment, the usefulness of
which ceased with the advent of the
steam navy. At the present time there are
eight bureaus, namely: Yards and Docks.
Equipment, Navigation. Ordnance. Con
struction and Repair, Steam Engineering,
Supplies and Accounts and Medicine and
Surgery. The functions of the Equip

The resignations in the United States
navy show no abatement and it is likely
that some law will be passed bv Con
gress to curtail this practice. There have
been eleven resignations since January 1,
1903, namely, three lieutenants, one Junior
lieutenant, one ensign, two passed assist
ant surgeons, two naval constructors, one
assistant constructor and one second lieu
tenant of marines. The resignation of the
eight Naval Academy graduates is espe
cially serious. The aggregate cost of
these officers for education and salaries
approximates $250,000, for which they have
rendered but HttJe service, and at this
particular time, when every one of the
lower grades is short of officers, the resig
nations are rather embarrassing to the
Navy Department. Thus, the construct

of forty members, still remains at the
same strength, and it will be utterly im
possible to increase it to seventy-five dur
ing the next six years, as contemplated
by the law of last March. It requires

of vessels than is demanded of a Junior

officer both failed to give the necessary
order to clear the steamer, and the re
sult was a collision with the Brummer.
A court martial followed at which the
watch officer was cleared and the captain
held responsible and sentenced to three
days' confinement in his quarters. An ap
peal was taken from one court to another
and the highest tribunal recently con
firmed the sentence. Another case is that
of the cruiser Ariadne, which was run
aground at Brest three months aso. It
was shown that accident was entirely un
avoidable, but nevertheless the court sen
tenced the captain to one day's arrest and
the navigator to three days, both to be
confined to their quarters for that period.
DESPITE the efforts of Tom Johnson to make
a campaign in Ohio this year on strictly local
issues the pressure of national interests at
stake has been too great to be avoided, and already
the contest has opened with the tariff question as the
primal object of controversy. Â¦'
It is strange that at this juncture', when the British
themselves are on the eve of abandoning the free
trade policy because of the ruin with which it threat
ens "manufacturing as well as agricultural industries,
any considerable number of Americans should think
of trying to adopt it as an American policy. Nothing
but the known capacity of Democratic leaders for
blundering suffices to induce the people to believe
that such an effort is likely to be made. There can,
however, be no doubt of it. The extraordinary activ
ity of the Free Trade League has long been notable,
and 'for some time past the reorganizers in their
struggles to get away from'Bryanism and free silver
have been floundering steadily toward the free trade
slough. Thus it is that in Ohio Mr. Clarke, the
Democratic nominee for the United States Senate,
who happens to be a gold Democrat, in seeking to
dodge the question of Bryanism has been forced to
make a fight on the tariff, and the issue thus becomes
the chief point of debate between himself and Senator
Hanna.
Clarke approached the subject with as much astute
ness as he possesses. He did not speak outright for
free trade, but sought to gain support from the
prejudices of the ignorant by advocating a repeal of
the tariff on goods manufactured by trusts. Further
more in order to give at least a pretense of a reason
why there should be a change from a Republican to
a Democratic administration he found it necessary
to say, "This country is on the verge of a financial
and industrial collapse."
Senator Hanna was prompt to take advantage of
the folly of his opponent. He has reminded the peo
ple of Ohio of the sound foundations of our prosper
ity and at the same time warned them of the folly of
alarming the timid by howling calamity and endeav
oring to destroy popular confidence in the contin
uance of good times. As the Senator put it: "The
only danger that can possibly come to the people of
this country is through their own act, by their own
power and the will to change those policies which
have made us what we are to-day."
Of the tariff issue the Senator said: "Mr. Clarke
qualifies his position on the tariff by saying that he
would take the tariff entirely off of every article man
ufactured by the trusts. What does that mean?
Every iron and steel industry in the United States,
everything connected with the metal trades, with the
cotton trades and, in fact, nearly all of our great in
dustries, would come under the scope of his proposi
tion. Why, is there any intelligent man among the
workingmen of my State who does not know what
would be the result of that policy? Absolute free
trade through all the schedules of our tariff would
shut up 75 per cent of the industrial institutions of the
United States until we could get labor down to the
price where we could compete with Europe."
There is no getting away from that proposition.
Tom Johnson, seeking the office of Governor of
Ohio, may evade the issue, but his candidate for the
United States Senate cannot. It is once more a
fight of the party of blunderers and deficits against
the principle of protection to American industry.
That is what the workingmen of Ohio are to face in
this campaign and it is what those of the whole coun
try will probably have to face in the Presidential cam
paign of next year.

Russia and Austria, it is said, will probably occupy
Macedonia to prevent a clash between Bulgaria and
Turkey and to save the slaughter of Christians. And
we have been trying for weeks to discover how the
unspeakable Turk was .to be driven out of Europe.
Our next speculation will be to determine the revised
maps of Austria and Russia.
Then again under the charter if private individuals
or corporations own the street railroads the city will
necessarily derive a profit from them as to all new
franchises granted. If a new franchise in granted the
city must receive at least 3 per cent of the gross re
ceipts for the first five years, 4 per cent for the next
ten years and 5 per cent for the next ten years. If
the gross receipts of this road amount to $200,000 a
year the city would receive during the twenty-five
years of the franchise the sum of $210,000, or $8400 a
year. This would % be the city's profit from the
road, earned without the expenditure of a dollar or
the imposition of a dollar's taxation on the people.
In addition the city would own at the expiration of
the franchise the roadbed and fixtures on the streets
without any cost to itself or the taxpayers.
Is there a business man that would hesitate a
second between the two propositions, viz.: Borrow
$710,000, and mortgage his property to secure the
loan, to invest it in an enterprise that his expert ad
viser tells him will cost him annually $20,550 more
than his income, or, Give another man the privilege of
undertaking this enterprise, let him do the borrowing
and charge him for the privilege $18,850 a year?
And yet the Examiner urges the people to undertake
the losing venture rather than receive the certain
profit, not because of any public necessity, not to
supply any urgent public need, nor for any sensible
reason that we have yet heard.
The city would receive about $10,000 a year in
taxes from any private owner of this road. This sum
it would forfeit if it owns the road. This amount
would be added to the general taxes to make up the
required sum, as no one believes that the general
taxes would be reduced that amount. The taxpay
ers generally would have this additional amount to
pay. The same reasoning applies to the license fees
and to the sums that would have to be paid for in
juries resulting from the negligence of the employes.
A municipal corporation operating a street railroad
is to that extent acting in a private and not a public
capacity, and many courts hold it liable for such in
juries.
But apart from these figures, how about the loss of
the profits that would accrue to the city if a franchise
were granted to a private owner? The Examiner has
carefully refrained from noticing these items and yet
they are most important
THE Examiner of September 16 attacks the
estimates of the City Engineer as to the cost of
operating the Geary-Street road and character
izes them as "hasty." The fact is that the City En
gineer was several months in making these estimates,
that he is the only official upon whose estimates the
municipality can act and that he has estimated that it
will cost the city annually $20,550 in excess of its re
ceipts to operate this road, pay the interest on its
bonds and raise the sinking fund positively required
by the charter.

of the ore will be found there in the least expected
places. Of the probability of gold production arti
ficially he has little expectation, saying: "The
alchemist has tried for ages to imitate the process of
nature and to manufacture gold by transmutation of
baser metals. He has never succeeded, nor is there
much hope that he will. Gold is a distinct goal of a
certain process of time. It is utmost complexity per
fected into irreducible simplicity, a fruit which only
ripens on the ramified tree of the ages."

PERSONAL MENTION.
I>r. Mclvor-Tyndall's lecture on "Hyp
notism: Good and .Bad," attracted a large
audience to Stelnway Hall last evening.
He pointed out the difference between
suggestion and hypnotism and cited In
stances to prove the truth of his theories.
Personal magnetism, cures by faith, sug
gestion and hypnotic treatment were ex
plained and the methods of inducing the
hypnotized condition illustrated. Dr. Mc-
Ivor-Tyndall does not agree with the ma
jority of those who either know, or af
fect to know, the possibilities of hypnotic
suggestion. He claims that a person may
be hypnotized against his will, and that
fie' may also be induced to commit an act
hat he would not commit In his normal
state. He spoke briefly of the famous
Bompard . case. In .which the Bompard
woman claims that she was hypnotized to
commit the crime for which Eyraud was
executed. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall said last
night that Buch a thing was possible, al
though he was not prepared to say that
it was true In the case of this woman. The
lecture was listened to with evident at
tention. The experiments in psychic power
that followed were particularly well pre-
Tyndall's Lecture.
An entirely new vaudeville bill has b*en
arranged for the.cominir week at The

performance.
"After Dark" is on the bill at the Cen
tral Theater all this week, beginning this
evening.

and will bo continued all this week, be
ginning to-night.
"Carmen" will be sung at the Tivoli
Opera House to-night, Wednesday, Fri
day and Saturday nights and "La Travi
ata" is the attraction for Tuesday, Thurs
day and Sunday nights.
"The Adventures of I^ady Ursula" Is the
attraction offered at the .ilcazar Theater
for to-night. Tuesday, Wednesday and
Saturday nights. "Gloconda" will be
given on Thursday and Friday nights.
The Pollard Opera Company will appear

"Dorothy" will be rendered on Tuesday
and Wednesday nights and "The Belle of
New York" on Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights.
"The Prince of Pilsen" will be presented
at the Columbia Theater during the com
ing week, commencing to-night.
The Orpheum show affords amusement
of a high' order this week. The usually
large crowd attended both afternoon and
evening performances yesterday and went
away to tell their friends about it. Four
new numbers are on the programme, and
the holdover acts are the ones that won
tho highest favors last week.
Of the new acts Falke and Semon, pre
mier musical comedians, excel. Both are
tiptop artists and make music from a
unique conglomeration of instruments.
They are masters of what they under
take, and at the end of each selection
were heartily encored. As well as being
musicians, they are comedians, and their
eccentricity lends color to the act.
Woods and Ray in "a funny bunch of
nonsense" do clever work and established
their popularity before they had been on
the stage very long. Their burlesque turns
are good and bring out many laughs.
Charles Ernest in "songs and sayings"
makes a hit with the audience, and his
wit is all original. He has a good voice,
which serves him well in the role of a
black face comedian. Mario and Aldo do
marvelous tricks on horizontal bars. They
are the best in their line that have been
on the bills for some weeks past. Frederic
Bond and company have changed their
act and produce a no%-el burletta, "Re
hearsing a Tragedy." Bond appears as
the stage manager. Miss Benton as a so
ciety debutante, Arthur Buchanan as a
society man and Miss Tassin as the thea
ter scrub lady. The act is true to life be
hind the scenes of the stage manager's
troubles and the "stage-struck" girl's
aspirations.
Princess Losoros. the East Indian prima
donna soprano, scores another success,
and her appearance before the footlights
was a signal for a burst of applause. The
Princess appears in new songs, all of
which she renders with the same dainti
ness and sweetness of voice as charac
terized her selections last Â¦week. James
Richmond Glenroy, the "man with the
green gloves," who can make fur out of
anything, seems to grow more comical at
each performance. E. Rousby's spectacu
lar novelty "In Paris" continues to at
tract interest. It is certainly the finest
thing of its kind the Orpheum has ever
produced and would be a star attraction
for weeks to come. Arnesen opens the
show in wonderful balancing- and gym
nastic work.
Miss Mabel Hite, who appears in the
first act in the guise of an accentuated
Sis Hopkins, is not allowed to display her
charms until within a few minutes of the
fall of the last curtain. But as a bottled
Washoe zephyr she can teach something
to the craziest soubrette on the Orpheum
circuit. Miss May Boley makes a very
successful director of chaperons. Her
eye can express a great many significant
things. As the singer of the piece Miss
Genevieve Day acquits herself more than
creditably.
But L.adell Is only a part' of a very
clever show. "The Chaperons" is one of
those tVpical New York musical farces
which mounts to the head like a cham
pagne punch and makes you laugh im
moderately. It is all gags and frou-frou
with some music The gags are new; the
frou-frou appears so under the calcium,
and the music will probably be sold upon
the street corners next week.
It is really a very honest show which
Mr. Thall offers at the California. Unlike
so many of the musical comedies "direct
from 100 nights in New York." "The Chap
erons" offers to a San Francisco audi
ence a full chorus, not one pruned to cut
down the expenses of the Western trip;
the gowns do not show any resin dust,
and the show girls are not levied from
local academies of dancing.
According to the latest conception of
what a popular musical comedy should
be, the production at the California is
not without its eight very statuesque and
very stunningly gowned young ladles,
whose duty it is to twirl their skirts
about them and look attractive. Besides
these there are some good dancers and
a couple of fair voices. They are all
pretty and very much of New York.
For those who find pleasure in seeing a
man slide from center stage to left exit
upon his ear, the California this week of
fers an attraction. Not only does the
diminutive Harry Ladell run slivers into
his left ear lobe for the amusement of
the audience, but he pirouettes upon his
head in spirals and squats like the lion
slaying baboon, and his face looks like a
cartoon in a German comic paper. He is
immense.

The beautiful altar of the new syna
gogue where the ceremonials took place
Is in itself a thing of rare magnificence.
With white satin altar cloths embroidered
Jn gold thread and the heavy beaten brass
candelabra flanking the central tapestry,
the general effect of the sanctuary is one
of elaborate ornateness. Before this
shrine all the rabbis of the city were
yesterday assembled to chant the an
cient psalms of David in the forgotten
tongue of the ancient Israelites.
The ritual opened with a procession of
the rabbis and the members of the build
ing committee, bearing the holy scrolls.
Solemnly chanting in Hebrew the assem
blage moved down the center aisle to the
pulpit. There, after the intonation of
more psalms, Eli Gordon, president of the
congregation, lit the perpetual lamp, re
citing meanwhile an appropriate text
from Genesis.
After closing the sacred ark of God, J.
Simon, chairman of the building commit
tee, handed the key to President Gordon
and the ceremonial was complete. Rabbi
Jacob Voorsanger, Rabbi Isidore Myers
end Rabbi J. Nieto delivered addresses.
The following are the officers, trustees
and committees of the congregation:
With all of the ceremonial of the ortho
dox Jewish religion, the new synagogue
of the Congregation Keneseth Israel on
Russ street, near Folsom. was conse
crated to the use of God yesterday after
noon. Good singing and a ritual which
was impressive by its solemn symbolism
marked the occasion in a manner befit
ting the establishment of a new house of
worship.
The afternoon was given up to a musi
cal and vocal programme, participated in
by Miss Alice Van Reynegom, Miss A.
Oliver, Mrs. C. B. Fenn, Miss Grace St.
John, Miss Evelyn Sresovich, Miss Clara
Baker, Mrs. Carl Sommer and Miss Marie
Giorgiana, organist of St. Mary's Church
and under whose direction ttv> programme

Among the toasts proposed were the
following: "Sister Superior." by Miss
Josephine T. Molloy; "Sister Xavier," by
Mrs. Garret McEnerney; "Alma Mater,"
Miss Reglna Cleary; "Our Teachers." by
Mrs. C. B. Fenn; "To the Sisters," by
Miss Margaret Donnelly. Songs and
poems were given at the banquet by Miss
Annie Oliver and Miss Evelyn Sresovich.
Sister Superior Julia Therese was vis
ibly affected when she was presented with
a check for a substantial sum of money
by President Mrs. K. M. Lawler on be
half of the alumnae. The Sister Supe
rior thanked her former pupils for their
kindness and said she would ever cherish
the thoughts of friendship extended to
her by the alumnae.
Sister Xavier, one of the oldest teachers
in the college and from whom all the
alumnae had imbibed knowledge, was the
recipient of many floral gifts and she was
overwhelmed with congratulations by her
former scholars.
It was also decided to form a choral
society in connection with the Alumnae
Association and the requiem service for
deceased members was fixed to take place
in November next in the college chapel.
The business session was followed by
an elaborate banquet, served in the con
vent refectory, the Sister Superior and
her associates being present.
Mrs. Kate M. Lawler, president; Miss
Josephine O'Nell, first vice president;
Miss Reglna Cleary, second vice presi
dent: Dr. Kate Brady, third vice presi
dent: Sifter Mary Xavier, treasurer; Miss
Marie Geary, secretary; Miss Margaret
New, financial secretary; Mrs. C. B. Fenn,
Miss Sallie Keenan, Mrs Zoe Radcliffe,
Miss Genevleve McGovern, Miss Agnes
Mahony. Mrs. Garret McEnerney, Mi33
Josephine T. Molloy, Miss Annie Devlin,
Miss Evelyn .Sresovich, Mrs. Mary Crow
ley and Mrs. Mary McCarthy, directors.
Sister Superior Julia Therese of Notre
Dame College was unanimously elected
as honorary president and adviser to the
association.
The day's celebration opened with a busi
ness meeting in the morning and letters
of congratulation were read from the Sis
ter Superiors of the various colleges of
the Notre Dame throughout the State.
The principal work of the business ses
sion was the election of officers for the
ensuing year, those elected being as fol
lows:
other members.
The Alumnae Association of Notre
Dame College held Its first anniversary
celebration at the college at Dolores antl
Sixteenth streets all day yesterday.

Special Excursions to the East
With Stops at Salt Lake City and Denver.
If you want to Bee the sights going East remember that the Burlington Route has arranged 'fbr
special parties to leave Oakland Pier every Friday evening. They will travel in Pulhnan tourist
Bleeping cars via Salt Lake City and the Denver & Bio Grande Railway to Denver, and the Burling-
ton Route to Omaha, Chicago and Boston. Stops for sight-seeing will be made at Salt Lake City aad
Denver. The stop at Salt Lake City will be sufficient to see all of the many interesting sights. $
If you want to "see the country" on your way East^ this is the excursion to join. It is personally*con- |*
ducted, being in charge of one of the Burlington's most experienced men. He has made the overland
journey a score of times or more, is familiar with all the points of interest along the line and is qualified
to give passengers a great deal of useful and reliable information, besides being of great assistance
in other ways. Ladies traveling alone or with children will especially appreciate this feature.
Burlington Route personally conducted parties for the East also leave San Francisco every Tuesday and
Thursday going through in a Tourist Sleeper, personally conducted, by way of Sfcdt Lake City and Colorado>
and without stops, so if you are in a big hurry, start on one of these days.
All these parties go through Colorado by daylight, affording a splendid view of the incomparablygrand
Rocky Mountain scenery.
Let me tell you more about these parties and how much money you can save by joining one of them.

Jack Cooney, the old-time St. Mary's
College pitcher, was in the points for Un
cle during the morning period tit Oakland.
He had nothing the Senators could not
hit. Then to add to the troubles of tho
home team he was wild all the time, and
therefore the Senators had a mtrry tlms
of It running over the sacks. At that thÂ«
home team had many chances to win. as
the fielding of the visitors was bad. but
they never could get hits when they were
good for runs. The score:

RUS'S AND HITS BY INNINGS.
Jimmy Whalen. whom, the fans relied
upon to do all the work for them, waÂ»
sadly off color. He did not have his con
trol with him. He was hit like a punch
ing bag when the Senators desired. Jimmy
was responsible for most or the runs.
Truck Egan started to make the first
Senatorial run In the fourth inning by
taking a pass. On Sheehan's hit over sec
ond he went to third and scored while the
opposing lnfleld was busy putting Doyla
out at first. They laid lonr then till tha
seventh, when Graham hit and Hogan
bunted. Whalen threw too late to catch
Graham at second and Tommy Leahy
then let one go past him, so both runners
advanced. Knell's out put Graham safe
ly over the Jumps and Casey dU the same
for Hogan. A double by Mildebrand and
a single from the bat of McLaughlin
made another In the same inninc. One
more came through in the ninth, making
five In all. The score:
So the series has closed and Mike Fish
er has profited by the good wind that h.13
blown his way. He has increased his per
centage considerably. If he can but keep
up this stride next week the league will
have a new team In the second position.
Ancient Phil Knell and hla mysterious
slow kinks were the most striking inci
dents in the afternoon game at Recrea
tion Park. From the first Innlns until all
was at an end the old war horse was
there, Why the locals did not hit him is
a mystery unexplained, but he got away
with the game and is deserving of credit.
Mike Fisher and his Senatorial gladia
tors put the finishing touches yesterday
to the good work they have been doln?
against the home crowd during the past
week. Twice did they, triumph and vic

pick-me-ups never had a chance end they
went down. 7 to 5. 'Twas even worse at
the Eighth-street lot. for the natives

. The swinging racquets made more than
one severe gash on the heads of several
of the athletes, but did not deter them
from continuing the game with vigor.
Lyons of the Tecumsehs was the partic
ular star of the occasion. Three goals
were credited to him and he prevented
his opponents from getting tho elusive
ball between the pests on his side of the
field more than once. Williams, though
ho was severely cut over the eye with a
racquet, also tallied three goals for the
Tecumsehs by his brilliant plays. The
list of goals and those who made them
follows:

the Tecumsehs carried off the victory by
a score of 7 goals to their opponents* 4.

tional incidents, which brought salvos of

lor game, as was attested by the number
of cuts and bruises received by the play
ers.

played In the city was held yesterday on
the Golden Gate Park courts. It was the
seventh handicap doubles tourney for
the loving cup. which must be won three
times. The fact that only six of the
thirty-two teams entered remained at
the conclusion of the day's play shows
how ably the affair was handled with
only three courts available. The handi
capping was as good as is usual in these
events, and the matches as a rule were
close. In the upper half Harry Routh
and Charles Dunlap reached the semi
final?. Horace Mann and Ed Finnegan
are in a like position in the lower half.

of the match between Jules Brady and
R. lit Whitney and George James and

ST. IX5TJIS LOSES TWO
GAMES TO THE BOSTONS
The natural way for Rex to get out was
to retreat through the same door he went
In, but Instead he gave one bound and
leaped through an open window. Pro
fessor Lawson was astonished at this
and hurried to the window, expecting to
see the dog a mangled corpse below. Rex
was still alive, however, and standing on
the spot where he had landed. In a mo
ment he regained his equilibrium and
then looked knowingly up at the window
as if to estimate the distance of his
flight. When ne had satisfied himself in
this respect he walked to a lawn and
lay down, for the breath had been
knocked out of him. Afterward his mas
ter found marks in the macadamlzÂ«<l
road made by the paws that had beÂ«n
sunk deep by the force of the fall.
Rex is a valuable black hound, marked
with white, the son of the great $10,000
dog, Kmin Pasha, and the dam. Pet Cur
by. He is simply the pet of his master
and has been in a few puppy class cours
ing matches since his life began, twenty
six months ago.
Rex was not a bit vain about his ac
complishment either, for there was only
one spectatorâ Professor A. C. Lawson et
the university. Professor Lawton'i of
fice is a room on the second floor of South
Hall, forty feet above ground, a high base
ment and first floor Intervening.
While Professor Lawson was at work yes
terday mornlns Rex. whose master was
taking a lecture in geology In another
room on the same floor, wandered into his
presence and offered to kiss him, but Pro
fessor Lawson was annoyed at the In
trusion and shouted impatiently, "Get out
of here!"
A leap of forty feet and not even
scratchedâ that is the exploit that was
performed yesterday by Rex, a blue
blooded greyhound belonging to Frank
Mulgrew, a student at the University of
California. The dog jumped from a sec
ond-story window of South Hall, landed
right side up and then walked off as If
it had been practicing that sort of thin*
all ita life.

Those unfamiliar with the differences
in the construction of ships made for war
and peace may wonder that the speed of
13.1 knots an hour maintained by the
Kearsarge is a cause for jubilation, when
passenger steamers make more than 20
knots. The passenger ship being built
for speed is given length ten times her
beam measurement, while in the floating
battery the proportion is but five to one.
The "liner" uses 25,000 to 37,000 horsepow

UNION GUN CLUB MEN
MEET AT INGLESIDE TRAPS
The principals in the case are aged per
sons. Dunton is 75, Barnes 72 and his
wife 71 years of age. Dunton has been
a boarder in the family for several years,
although he has near relatives, includ
ing a son, living.
Mrs. Barnes is rapidly recovering from
the effects of the assault, but the doctors
give no hope of saving Dunton's life.
EAST SULLIVAN, N. H., Sept. 20.â
Malachi Barnes is confined in the County
Jail on suspicion that it was he who yes
terday beat Mrs. Barnes and Asabel Dun
ton, an old man who lived with the
Barnes family. Dunton is still uncon
scious from his injuries. The fact devel
oped to-day that there had been frequent
quarrels between Barnes and Dunton, the
former being jealous of the latter.
Mrs. Barnes first gave Sheriff Tuttle to
understand that the house had been visit
ed by a tramp who committed the dou
ble assault. To-day, however, she made
a formal statement to the Sheriff, which
the latter said justified him in taking
Barnes into custody. Afterward the
Sheriff went to the Barnes house and in
the yard discovered what is believed to
have been the weapon with which the
bloody work was doneâ a bark peeler
having a blade two faet in length and a
wooden handle of the same length. On
the blade of the bark peeler were blood
stains and human hair. He discovered
absolutely no evidence of a tramp hav
ing been in the vicinity last night or
yesterday.

Â«jÂ«,lll& Broadway. Sept. 20.
Charles Allman, a switchman in the
employ of the Southern Pacific Company,
was almost instantly killed at S:30 o'clock
this morning in the West Oakland yards
by falling from a box car.
Allman was riding on a car on the
rear end of the train, which wirs back-
Ing up to couple on to other cars.
He evidently did not know that the cars
were coming bo close together and was
thus unprepared for the Jolt. He lost his
balance and fell headlor.g from the high
car. striking his head upon a rail.
When his fellow trainmen rushed to his
aid Allman was unconscious and bleeding
profusely. The ambulance was summoned
and the injured man conveyed to the Re
ceiving Hospital. He never regained con
sciousness and passed^iway at noon from
hemorrhage of the brain.
Allman leaves a young bride of five
months. He was 27 years of age, a native
of Indiana and resided at 1366 Twelfth
street. West Oakland.

The Sheriff said:
De Bray came to the conclusion that his em
ployer was rich and that he could force him
to yield. I am satisfied that he act the flre,
and falling, worked out the scheme of the pis
tol shooting and the threatening letter. DÂ«
Bray is an educated man and clever enough to
have given us a great deal of effort to uncover
the truth. HiÂ» confession is complete so far
as his admissions about the letter writing are
concerned, and that is the material thing in
the case. He will plead guilty to-morrow be
fore the Superior Court.
Mlntzner offered $2000 reward for the ar
rest and conviction of the incendiary,
and, according to Sheriff Veale,. the Rich
mond capitalist is satisfied that De Bray
is the man.
Although De Bray denies that he set
the lire or discharged the pistol. Sheriff
Veale is satisfied that his prisoner was
guilty of both crimes, as well as the one
which he has confessed.
A trap was set at night, but owing to
fog the seeker for the money was not
caught until later. The nlgnt the letter
was left a pistol ehot was fired into the
house, and a month before that occur
rence an attempt was made to burn the
Mintzner residence.
Pierre de Bray, the young French
house servant arrested two months ago
on a charg'e of attempted extortion from
William Mlntzner, the manager of the
Tewksbury estate at Richmond, made
confession to-day to Sheriff Veale of Con
tra Costa County at the County Jail in
Martinez. De Bray's confession was made
through Max Blum, a Martinez merchant,
acting as interpreter, who assisted the
Sheriff and Constable John E. Bouquet
of San Pablo in the long effort to un
cover the mystery- De Bray made his
statement in writing. As well, he Â¦wrote a
letter to his former employers, Mr. and
Mrs. Mintzner, acknowledging that he
had written the letter in which he threat
ened to kill the Mlntzner family unless
the head of the family produced $3000. The
letter notified Mintzner to put tne money
at a designated place on the residence
grounds, which are in the foothills east
of Richmond.

An inquest will be held Tuesday morning
at 11 o'clock at the Kern's ranch by Coro
ner Curry.
Longuvj'.l* g^ve his version cf the acci
dental shooting of Tweedy to Coroner
Curry, who made no arrÂ«Â»st. but summoned
him as d. witness for the inquest. Longu
ville said:
Tweedy was an employe of the Sunset
T>l*ephcn<? Company in San Francisco,
having had charge of the telephone sta
tions at the ferry depot. He was a native
Â«f San Francisco, and the son of Mr. nnd
-.Zi s. J. J. Tweed*'.
The phot tore two great holes in the
>â¢]>â¢Â¦Â« neck and he fell to the ground.
I>irgTJville hurried oft* to eet assistance
from some campers they had met but by
the time they reached Tweedy's side he
was dead. Coroner Curry of Contra
Costa County was notified, and late
this evening the body was brought to the
Berkeley morgue, whre Tweedy's father,
who had be<?n Fumn^r.iv], mot It.
BERKELEY. Sept. 20. â Clarence
Tweedy, ii years of age, and who lived
with his patents at 72 Plc:i?ant street.
Â£an Francisto, was accidentally phot and
killed this afternoon on the- Kerns ranch
in Contra Costa County. While attempt
ing to climb a ft i:ce both hummers of the
shotgun he hml carried were pressed
backward, :tt:-l an instant later the shot
from two cartr:dfcjÂ«s was discharged in his
neck, killing him aimest instantly.
Tweedy w:t.< not killed in the usual
manner of rr.rn who pull guns through
fences but un a most imfuriunate way
after lie had usrd mote than ordinary
care. With I:is oorrmur.ion, Joseph Lor.gu
vllle of 6 Loroy Place, San Francisco, he
reached a wire me*b ine* on his way
home after a hur.tlr.c trip at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. Longuvilie, who had a
rifle, pushed his gun beneath the fvnee
Â«nd got over in safety. But Tweedy first
I>ut his gun over the top of the fence,
leaning it acainst the mesh, and then
Â¦fctgan climbing over. In mounting his
veipht pressed the wifs against the ham
Â»uÂ»rs and lifted them fcarkward and whtn
xhe pressure was released they fell.
By the exercise of vigilance Patrolmen
C. W. Brown and A. F. Holmeq succeed
ed in landing a trio of supposed burglars
last night . and recovering a portion of
booty stolen from the establishment of
the Pacific States Type Foundry at 503
Clay 6treet.
' The men in custody gave the names of
William Jones, William C. r-hillips and
Leslie E. Dennison and the police believe
they are the crooks that have been suc
cessfully operating in the wholesale dis
trict for some time past.
Shortly after 9 o'clock last evening,
while the officers were standing at the
patrol box. at \he corner of Clay and
Montgomery streets, awaiting the arriv
al of the patrol wagon to convey two
prisoners to the Hall of Justice, their at
tention was attracted by the peculiar ac
tion of two men coming up Clay street.
As soon as they saw the officers they
halted and started toward the opposite
side of the street. Their general appear
ance was bad and Patrolmen Brown and
Holmes having placed their prisoners in
the wagon, started after the two sus
pects. Upon being overhauled the men
protested that they had not been guilty
of any wrong, but a search of their pock
ets brought to light six fonts of type and
a large quantity of valuable printers'
tools. The packages of type bore the
label of the Pacific States Type Foundry
and after having booked their , prisoners
at the City Prison the officers paid a vis
it to the type foundry.
An investigation developed the fact that
the lock had been broken oft and the
front door and an Inside glass door had
also been forced. The manager of the es
tablishment was notified, but it will be
impossible to determine without taking
stock whether or not the type and tools
found on Jones and Phillips represent all
of the plunder secured. After consider
able work the officers succeeded in locat
ing the room occupied by Phillips at 519
Montgomery street. Dennison was found
in the apartment and taken into custody.
From a card of the San Francisco Type
Founders' Union found on Phillips it was
ascertained that his right name is Wil
liam Davis. A copy of the New Testa
ment discovered in his room bears his
name on the flyleaf, the book having been
Ktven to him by the Penlel Mission. Noth
ing is known of the antecedents o,f the
men in custody and an examination of the
pictures in the rogues' gallery will be
made In an endeavor to find if they have
eervpd time or are wanted in some other
city. It is understood that Phillips, alias
Davis, applied for work at the type foun
dry several days ago and it is thought
that he familiarized himself with the in
terior arrangement of the place at that
i time.

The trip was uneventful so far as the
weather was concerned. From Honolulu
the ocean was almost like a mill pond.
The American ship Susquehanna docked
at Howard street wharf.
On September 5 they sighted the French
bar Connetable de Richemon." She sig
naled to the Peking that she was out of
provisions, and the steamer hove to and
gave her the assistance she required. The
bark was at that time eighty days from
Hongkong and was bound for the coast
of Chile. She had encountered a succes
sion of calms, and although fully equipped
for the regulation voyage was destined to
become short of provisions unless she ap
pealed for help.
On September 17 the steamship Nevadan,
from San Francisco for Honolulu, was
spoken in latitude 30.50 north, longitude
141 west.
Among the passengers was A. H. Geffe
ney, who has been the United States of
ficial Japanese interpreter at Honolulu
for the last two years. He is returning
with his family, as the climate in the isl
ands did not agree with them, and is en
route to Seattle to fill a similar position.

3, the second day out from Yokohama,
she transferred a stowaway to the steam-

The Church of the Holy Cross on Eddy
street, near Devlsadero, was the scene
yesterday afternoon of the confirmation
of a large number of boys and girls by
Coadjutor Archbishop Montgomery.
The sacred edifice was crowded to the
doors by the relatives and friends of the
young communicants and the interior of
the church presented an animated ap
pearance. The altar was ablaze with
lighted candles and was exquisitely dec
orated with large clusters of red roses.
Archbishop Montgomery was assisted
by Rev. Father McGinty, pastor of Holy
Cross Church; Fathers Ryan, Ramm and
many other members of the clergy.
The service of confirmation was con
ducted of -the Coadjutor Archbishop and
a special musical programme was ren
dered by the choir under the direction of
the organist, Harry "Wood Brown.
Archbishop Montgomery delivered a
short sermon and urged that the parents
of the children should assist the church
by proper religious work at home. He
insisted that parents should hold morning
and evening prayer in the household and
that proper religious literature and em
blems should be displayed in homes, and
the work of grace intensified. Homes of
virtue and good example would help the
seed that had been planted and bear good
fruit and children would as a rule fol
low in the footsteps of their parents.
The names of- the boys and girls con
firmed are as follows:
Church of Holy Cross Is
the Scene of the
Service.

President Fugazi displayed a beautiful
flag, amid enthusiasm, the flag being the
one sent by the Italian colony In 1S95 to
Rome, when the Italian people celebrated
the twenty-fifth anniversary of their
unity. The flag was taken to Rome by
J. F. Fugazi and three companions, and
with its escort was given a place of honor
In the military parade witnessed by the
lata King Humbert, Fugazi being deco
rated by the King.
The children of the Italian free school
sang the American and Italian national
aris, and the graduates of the school were
presented with their diplomas by the Con
sul. A short musical programme was
given, which was followed by the grand
Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz was present
and delivered a brief address, dwelling on
the value of keeping alive the mother
tongue and congratulating his hearers on
the friendly relations between America
and Italy. *
The addresses of the orators, C. Cale
garls and A. D. Splivalo, dealt with the
momentous events that led up to the en
try of the royal troops into Rome on Sep
tember 20, 1S70, and the unification of
Italy. Both speakers lauded the men who
figured in the triumph of Italian arms
and paid a tribute to the mother country,
which they designated as the nursery of
all art. literature and science.
Count Grimani, the acting Italian Con
sul, delivered a brief speech, in which he
thanked Mayor Schmitz for his presence
and the people of San Francisco for their
interest and friendship to the Italian col
ony.
American colony at Washington
Hall. Union and Stockton streets, by a
reception and a grand ball, the proceeds
being in aid of the free Italian school
maintained by the colony.
Washington Hall was gayly bedecked
with American and Italian colors, and a
military band discoursed national and
popular airs of the two countries pre
vious to the exercises, which were lis
tened to by a large" audience.
J. F. Fugazl was the president of the
celebration, assisted by Count P. L. Gri
mani, acting Italian Consul; honorary
president. L. Vanzi, vice president. C.
Calegarls was the orator In Italian and
A. D. Splivalo orator in English.
THE anniversary of the entry of
the Italian troops into Rome, on
September 20, 1870, was celebrated
last evening by the local Italian-
"Vast tracts of this land are at present
lying idle. It is estimated that between
t-lx and eight million acres would thus
come into possession of the corporations
if this law should be passed. Some of the
ablest men in the country were in attend
ance at the congress and most of them
ljitterly opposed the homestead act."
Mr. Needham stated that California was
the best represented State in the Union
at the convention outside of Utah and
Idaho. Sixty delegates from this State
attended, headed by Governor Pardee.
The congress discussed the advisability
of storinc the flood waters of the Sac
ramento River for irrigation purposes and
this may be done some day, though no
definite plans have yet been arranged.
"There was a fight regarding the home
ftead act, the timber and stone act and
the desert act. The majority board was
In favor of the repeal of these acts, while
th<? minority fought against such action.
""I was called upon and I offered a sub-
Ftitute for the minority report, which was
printed in full in the press dispatches
iast Saturday. This was adopted by the
congress. It dealt principally with the
homestead act, which is very important.
"The public in general seems to favor
the r.dop::on of this act by Congress and
therefore a great many of the residents
of this State may feel hurt at the stand
which the California delegation took
against It. When the matter is fully ex
plained the people will pee that we acted
for their benefit and we hope they will
rt-alize this later on.
"At present a great deal of this land.
in scrip, is held by various railroad com
panies and other big corporations. Now,
if Congress should pass the much dis
cussed homestead law these corporations
would simply take possession of this land
and gobble most of it up and consequent
ly the puMic in general would benefit but
little by such action.
"I fear that many persons in this State
who were interested in the proceedings
of the convention will be rather disap
pointed by the way in which the Califor
nia delegation fought against the home
stead act." paid Mr. Netdham last night,
"but at all events, when they learn that
we have acted for their benefit they will
cor.ce-de that our stand was just and
proper. â¢ ,
Congressman J. C. Needham of the
Sixth Congressional District arrived in
this city last night from Ogden. Utah,
where he went as a delegate from this
State to attend the eleventh annual ses
eicn of the National Irrigation Congress.
Mr. Needham took an important part in
the work done by the congress and was
one of the foremost speakers during the
session.
He states that the last session of the
congress was the most important yet held
end also the most successful. More than
a thousand delegates from all parts of the
country attended the session. Much of
the work done will be of interest to the
West.
United States District Attorney Wood
worth says that the names of all the men
implicated in the conspiracy by the origi
nal confession of Gamble have been made
public and there will be no further devel
opments except the ordin.-.ry legal pro
cedure. Hoon Toon and Wong Tin, the
two Chinese concerned In the plot, have
not been apprehended and their where
abouts is unknown to the officers.'
The funeral of the late William P. Gam
ble, who killed himself Friday night last
in Buena Vista Park as a result of the
disgrace he incurred by reason of his
complicity in the substitution plot, will
take place this morning at 11:45 o'clock
from Halsted's undertaking establish
ment, where the remains have been ever
since they were released by the Coroner.
The prisoners are in no mood for talk
ing. They say 'they do not want to be
Interviewed, and all protest that ail they
know of the case has already been pub
lished. They were visited by a number
of friends during the day and evening.
They do not appear to be cast down and
are doing all they can to make the best
of a bad situation.
Thomas T. Burnett, Thomas J. Demp
sey and "William F. Dasha, -the three
night jailers at the County Jail who con
fessed to complicity in the substitution of
six decrepit Chinese in lieu of six young
Mongolians who had been ordered to be
deported from this country, are still con
fined in the City Prison. None of them
has made any attempt to secure bail,
and in any case such an effort would be
futile. The arrest of the three men be
came public at such a late hour Saturday
afternoon that all the Federal officials
had quit their offices. United States
Commissioner Heacock had gone home
and no bail was fixed. Yesterday being
a holiday no further action was taken in
regard to bail. To-day an attempt will
be made to have the amount of ball set.
All three men profess to be able to fur
nish bonds. They want their liberty.
Burnett sent for an attorney yesterday
and held a consultation with him. None
of the prisoners has outlined any course
to pursue when the cases come to trial. In
view of the fact that they have all made
full confessions, detailing minutely the
process of substitution anc acknowledg
ing their complicity in the- work, it is
hard to say what else they can do but
plead guilty.
In their cases United States District
Attorney Woodworth is authority for the
statement that they are liable to five
years' imprisonment as a maximum pen
alty. While the act of substitution is
merely a misdemeanor, the law makes a
difference where two or more are engaged
in It, and defines it as conspiracy, elevat
ing the crime to a felony. The fact that
the accused men have confessed may
lend a lighter shade to their guilt and se
cure clemency when sentence is pro
nounced.
MANY CHILDREN
ARE CONFIRMED
Larsen claimed that he had been robbed
of 50 cents, but when Devins was searched
no money was found in his pockets and
it is supposed his confederate got the
coin. Larsen was taken to the prison to
be detained as a witness against Devins.
When the officers were within a hun
dred feet of the trio the two robbers,
Devins and his companion, ran along
Hawthorne street toward Folsom. Till
man and Heinrichs started in pursuit and
called upon the robbers to stop, but as
they paid no attention to the command
the two officers opened flre. Five shots
were discharged when Devins fell, but
immediately jumped to his feet and con
tinued to run. He was overtaken at Fol
som and Hawthorne streets and it was
discovered that one of the bullets had
struck him on the head, inflicting a slight
scalp wound. He was sent to the Central
Emergency Hospital and after his wound
was dressed he was booked on a charge of
robbery. The other robber escaped.
The robbery was a daring orfe, for Cor
poral Green and Policemen Tlllman and
Heinrichs were standing at the corner of
Third and Howard streets at the time it
happened. They were but half a block
away. Their attention was attracted by
cries of "Police, help, robbers," from
Louis Larsen, the victim, who is a lum
berman living at the Eureka Hotel at
Ritch and Brannan streets. They ran in
the direction of the cries and saw three
men struggling on the sidewalk at How
ard and New Montgomery streets. One
of the men was knocked down and an
other hurriedly went through his pock
ets.
The police are searching for the com
panion of John Devins, who was arrested
early yesterday morning on a charge of
robbery, and they expect to have him in
custody soon. Devins is only 19 years of
age, is a riveter and lives at Geneva and
Brannan streets. < ,'

Some sensible advice to
women passing through this
trying period.
The painful and annoying symp-
toms experienced by most women
at this period of life are easily over-
come by Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound. It is espe-
cially designed to meet the needs
of woman's system at the trying
time of change of life.
It is no exaggeration to state that
Mrs. Pinkham has over 5000 letters
like the following proving the great
value of her medicine at such times.
" I wish to thank Mrs. Pinkham for
what her medicine has done for me.
My trouble was change of life. Four
years ago my health bcjrau to fail, my
nead began to grow dizzy, my eyes
pained me, and at times it seemed as
if my back would fail me, had terrible
pains across the kidneys. Hot flashes
were very frequent and trying 1 . A
friend advised me to try Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound. I have taken six bottles of it
and am to-day free from those troubles.
I cannot speak in high enough rcrms
Â©f the medicine. I recommend it to all
and wish every suffering woman would
give it a trial. â Bella Boss, 88 Mont-
clair Ave., Boslindale, Mass. â fsooo for-
