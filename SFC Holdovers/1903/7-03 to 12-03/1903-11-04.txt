"I must say that? I am more rthan pleased With the result. I never had a serious doubt as
to the result of 'the [election. To the people who Iiavc supported me I am> indeed grateful. My

MAYOR SCHMITZ TH ANKS
PEOPLE FOR RE-ELECTION
apprised as to the number of Repub
lican ballots thrown out by election
officers.
Mayor Schmitz promises to give
the people a good administration, but
says nothing about the hideous
shadow of Ruef. Parry is delighted
beyond expression over the outcome
of the struggle and the colt is full
of pranks. As the campaign is now ,
concluded the clerks and attaches,!
connected with the administration
may go back to their respective sta
tions, and the Civil Service Commis
sioners, weary of campaigning on the
stump for Ruef and Schmitz, may
return to the old stand of- the com
mission in the City Hall. .
From the figures at hand it appears
that Lane receives about 12,000 votes,
Crocker 22,000, Schmitz 24,000 and
Whitney, Socialist, 2300. When Lane
ran for Governor he was hailed as
the friend of the workingman and the
champion of the common people. He
received 33,000 votes. It seems, there
fore, that 21,000 voters. who gave him
their support a year ago have under
gone a change of mind. The figures
may not be exactly 21,000, but the
number is not wide of the mark.
When all the returns arc tallied and
subjected. to analj'sis one may be able
to determine how many votes Rucf
transferred from the Republican col
umn to Schmitz and how many Mar
tin Kelly took to Lane.
The total vote of 60,300 cast yes
terday was somewhat of a surprise.
Experts, including the Registrar,
placed the number as low as 57,000.
Mr. Crocker made a 'fine showing in
the labor districts south of Market
street. Later on the public â¢ will - be
VOTERS CHANGED VIEWS.
political experts predicted that. a good
Democratic candidate could divide
the labor vote and this division would
have followed if any one other than
a professional job chaser had been
called to Democratic leadership.
Lane never had the ghost of a chance
to win. What little support he se
cured came from dyed in the wool
Democrats and non-partisans of the si-
Pcrhaps he would have Jess cause
for chagrin if one of his newspaper or
gans had not resorted to the most con
temptible form of misrepresentation to
bolster up this hopeless candidacy.
The Republican press and the Rcpub
lican campaign committee warned the
public at every stage of the campaign
that a vole for Lane was really a vote
for Schmitz. Results prove that the
warning was justified.
Early in the campaign many of the
y^ UGENE E. SCHMITZ is re
Â»Y elected to the office of Mayor,
M and it is devoutly to be
wished that his second admin
istration of municipal affairs will be
better than his first. His plurality, ac
cording to the votes tallied, will ap
proximate 2000. An army of muni
cipal attaches and political workers,
sustained by a campaign fund of $50,
000, won the battle, as the forces of
good citizenship were divided. Votes
which should have been given to Hen
ry J. Crocker were thrown away on
that unfortunate prince of demagogues
which Gavan McNab placed at the
head of the Democratic ticket.
Henry J. Crocker, the Republican
nominee, made the most creditable
campaign ever conducted in San Fran
cisco. He accepts the result in manly
fashion. He maintained throughout
the animated contest a straight
forward, honorable course, appealing
to the judgment and intelligence of
good citizenship for support. He car
ried the Assembly districts of the Re
publican column, but his pluralities do
not seem to be large enough to over
come the heavy vote which Mayor
Schiriitz receives in the so-called Dem
ocratic districts south of Market street.
LANE'S CASE WAS HOPELESS.
As foreshadowed in The Call from
' Â¦ -
day to day during the canvass, Frank
lin K. Lane failed to carry a single As

Candidates
Who Probably
Are Elected
Ohio has gone overwhelmingly Repub
lican. The contest in that State was for
Governor and the Legislature and it had
an additional interest because Senator
Hanna, chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee, is a candidate for re
election to the Senate. Hanna will con
trol the Legislature by a big" margin, and
Myron T. Herrick, Republican, has da-
LANDSLIDE IN OHIO.
One lesson of the returns Is that New
York is not only still a Democratic city,
but a Tammany city as well. Devery has
ceased to be an issue and the public has
taken the view that Devery was respon
sible for graft and blackmail and that
Tammany, having thrown Devery out.
was entitled to another trial In manag
ing the affairs of the municipality. Dev
ery's vote was pitifully small.
The election seems to have been very
fair and orderly. While the results show
a complete breakdown of Republican and
Fusion, It cannot bo charged that the Re
publican organization was treacherous.
The tide was simply strongly in favor of
Democracy and a wide-open town.
REPUBLICANS FAIL TO VOTE.
The Republicans who left their party
last year are still with the Democracy
and there also is evidence that thousands
did not go to the polls.
The constitutional amendment which
was submitted to voters, providing for
expenditure of $101,000,000 for the improve
ment of the Erie Canal so as to permit
the transportation of barges carrying
1000 tons of freight, probably has been
adopted. Very few counties up State vot
ed in favor of It. The amendment was
voted down by some of the more impor
tant counties traversed by tha canal. In
those counties which are not traversed
by the canal In Northern and Southern
New York the amendment was simply
slaughtered. Erie County, which was
supposed to be the hotbed of canal
sentiment, did not do as well as the ad
vocates of tha improvement had expected,
but New York County's heavy vote has
probably more than * offset the up State
result.
The Assembly of the State of New
York Is safely Republican.
plurality second only to the un
precedented sweep of 1902, when Coler car
ried the city by 122,000 votes more than
Odell, the Republican candidate, for Gov
ernor.
It was more than a landslideâ It was an
avalanche. Manhattan and the Bronx,
comprising New York County, gave a
plurality of between 60,000 and 70,000 for
McClellan, Grout and Forbes. Even
Brooklyn was carried by the Tammapy
ticket by a plurality approaching 4000. In
this Tammany sweep practically all
the Democratic candidates for borough
and county offices, except in Richmond,
triumphed. The Board of Aldermen will
be completely in the control of Tammany.
The verdict at the polls strongly en
trenches the wigwam in power in this
city. Charles F. Murphy becomes the
most important Democrat in the country.
He will probably have more influence in
the next Democratic National Convention
than Croker, Kelly or Hill ever had. be
cause he will not only be able to domi
nate the entire Democratic party of th*
entire city, but the Democratic party of
the State as well. Murphy's victory
seems to mean the destruction of both
Hill and Hugh Mclaughlin.
TAMMANY FOB CLEVELAND.
The Tammany leader will be abla to
name the next Democratic candidate for
Governor, and,- possibly, the next Demo
cratic candidate for President.
The Call Is informed that Tammany will
stand in favor of the nomination of
Grover Cleveland for President next year,
and It Is said that Judge D. Cady Herrlck
of Albany will displace Hill as nominal
State leader and may be the candidate of
the Democrats for Governor.

Then a second bullet was fired by the
thief, this time into the ground. The
Sheriff was about to shoot to kill when
Deputy McPhail, who had been left with
the buggy, approached and leveled his pis
tol a.t the thief, threatening him with
death. This was too much for the Ger
man and he gave up the fight. He wag
searched and another pistol and a whoie
arsenal of cartridges were found on him.
He was handcuffed and brought to the
Hollister jail, where he is now awaiting
the arrivaJ of the Monterey Sheriff.
The Sheriff immediately grabbed the
hand that held the weapon and threatened
to shoot. The thief was not frightened,
however, and succeeded in firing one shot.
The- Sheriff then fired a bullet from his
own pistol across the thief's stomach to
scare him. The Sheriff said:
"If you don't surrender I will kill you,"
Jiring at the same time another shot.
The Sheriff immediately took up the
trail and followed the tracks to the coun
ty road leading to San Felipe. AVhiie
passing the O'Donnell tield the Sheriff ob
t^t-rved an object about 2C0 yards from the
road. The officer cocked his rifle and as
he approached within eighty yards he
paw he had come upon the fugitive. The
latter was asleep and had a rifle between
his legs, res-ting on his left arm. A pistol
was sticking from a pocket.
Sheriff Croxton commanded the man to
surrender and he started from his slum
ber. Instantly grabbing his rifle. He at
tempted to arise, throwing the ritte
around and shooting at the same time.
At this point the Sheriff struck the rifle
with his left hand and grappled with the
man, throwing him on his back. The
thief struggled and as he partly got up
he pulled one of his pistols.

Destitution Prevails in Labrador.
ST. JOHNS. Newfoundland, Nov. 3.â
Extreme destitution is reported from
many parts of Labrador, owing to tho
shortage of the fishery eaten. Unless re
lief be provided by the Government it is
believed that many people will perish.
One vessel already has been dispatched
with provisions, but has not yet been re
ported arrived and the supplies she car
ried will have to be duplicated and sent
by another ship.
Coates denies absolutely that there was
any quarrel between him and Briggan.
The body was brought here by Coroner
Crowe this evening and viewed by the
Coroner's Jury. The lips and face of the
dead man are somewhat swollen and the
neck and upper part of the chest are dis
colored. These appear to be the only
marks of violence upon the body. To
morrow Dr. Ross will perform an au
topsy to discover the cause- of death.
. About a year ago Joseph Briggan, a
brother of the deceased, murdered a
farm hand on this same ranch and se
creted the body in the woods. The body
was subsequently found and Briggan was
tried and convicted of murder. He is now
serving a life sentence in San Quentin.
John Briggan told the officers that he
heard Coates come up and call him out to
have a drink. He refused and in a short
time he heard men quarreling and two
shots fired. He did not go out to see
what the trouble was for the reason that
he was afraid to do so. About 5 o'clock
this morning he went out to the barn and
found his brother dead. Ho states that
tho body was still warm. He immediately
jujSped upon his horse, rode to Woodside
and telephoned for the officers and a doc
tor.
REDWOOD CITY, Nov. 3.â Another
tragedy occurred last night on what ia
known as the Briggan ranch in the moun
tains south of here, resulting in the death
of Fred Briggan. A veil of mystery Bur
rounds the affair, but the officers who
have been working on the case have felt
justified In placing under arrest Thomas
Coates and Gus Johnson. Before morn
ing John Briggan, a brother of the de
ceased, will probably also be in jail. The
officers went to the mountains for him
this afternoon.
According to Coates he and Johnson
left Redwood City late yesterday morn
ing for the former's home beyond the
Briggan place. They took with them a
half-gallon demijohn of whisky and in
passing stopped at Briggan's, inviting
John to come out and have a drink. He
refused and they then sought Fred,' who
drank about a quart of, the liquor. The
whisky evidently overpowered him, for
he fell at the wheel of the wagon. Coates
*=ays he picked him up, carried him Into a
barn and placed him on a bed. He and
Johnson then drove away.

OF THE PACIFIC COAST
FOLSOM, Nov. 3.â Another desperate :
attempt at jail delivery was frustrated)
at the Folsom prison late yesterday aft
ernoon. That thS^lelivery was not just
as complete a success as the preceding
one of July 27 is due mainly to the*"
watchfulness of the officials at the prison.
Captain Murphy's quick action served to
stop the desperate band of convicts from
escaping:.
j^Theb reak was well planned and was
under the leadership of "Red Shirt" Hall. [
doing twenty years' service; Billy Aus-,
tin, a lifetimer, and "Hypo" Kelly, who}
is doing: thirteen years under the name of (
Smith. Whether the break was to be at- j
tempted last night or, like the former
one, in the morning, is a question. The
intention of the > convicts was >o capture
the engine and car at the rock crusher,
overpower Engineer Andrew O'Brien and
Brakeman M. Halloran and escape down
the. track toward Folsom.
Guard Woods was the first one to dis
cover something wrong when he saw one j
of the convicts trying to conceal a knife i
in hiB clothing. He immediately tele- 1
phoned in to Captain Murphy, who went
at once into the yard and searched a
number of convicts, with the result that |
he found seven knives. He ordered the
most desperate of them to be placed in
solitary confinement. This morning an
other large and ugly knife was found.
Convict 4548, known as "Red Shirt"
Hall, is one of the most desperate men
in the prison and was considered to be
the leader in caching the knives and
gunnysack suits in the rock crusher
shortly after the memorable break of
July 27 of the present year. Billy Austin
is another desperate man, while Smith,
who is a second termer, would stop at
nothing to succeed in escaping from the
prison.
It is a well known fact that there are
several cliques of convicts who realize
that if they have any chance to t-scape
at all it must be under the present ad
ministration. The convicts have taken
advantage of defects in discipline and
have devised all manner of schemes to
successfully escape.

Mexican Authorities Release Toscano.
CITY OF MEXICO, Nov. 3.â Ellas Tos
cano, who made a disturbance at Guana-
Jato by firing off his pistol in the presence
of President Diaz, was on examination
released, as he had clearly no intention
of shooting the President. This closes the
Incident.
During one. of the intervals an excep
tionally capable "orchestra discoursed the
Then came the reading of the imperial
edict by H. Soyejima, which in turn was
followed by a stirring oration In English
by K. Koda. The whole company then
arose and joined in singing the national
anthem of Japan, "Our Emperor For
ever." The anthem was sung in sturdy
fashion and then three cheers of "Ban
zai" went up In enthusiastic accord. An
official address was delivered by the Con
sul General and several tots were paraded
to the platform and repeated the national
anthem. ';,'i : p.
The programme which followed con
sisted of numerous items, from music on
the native instruments of Japan, brave
sword dances and fencing, which was at
moments balr-raising; children's songs
and a Japanese classical song. There was
also an acrobatic performance by two ex
ceedingly agile young people, which won
thunders of applause, and moving pic
tures, which gave the greatest delight to
young and old. The entertainment closed
with a rousing "Banzai" for the Japan
ese In America. *-lV. :.."-Â¦
IMPOSING CEREMONIES.
The day's entertainment, like that of
the evening at Mechanics' Pavilion, gave
any amount of amusement. Both pro
grammes were diversified and novel and
perhaps the celebration in the evening
was more imposing for the reason that
the thousands seated gave some idea of
the numerical strength of the colony and
by their appearance testified to their ma
terial welfare.
All the men and the women carried a
huge chrysanthemum, the imperial flower
of Japan, so styled because of ' the ad
miration bestowed on it by the first
reigning Emperor. ':Â¦Â¦:Â¦; 7
As K. Abiko, the chairman of the even-
Ing's festivity, arose from his seat on the
platform to deliver the opening remarks,
he was received with a volley of cheers.
His words rang with patriotism and re
spect for the Emperor' and his sentiments
were heartily indorsed by the vast assem
blage.
SING IBIPEBTAT, ANTHEMS.
The Japanese Consul General, Kisaburo
Uyeno, with his suite, was of the dis
tinguished party representing the court of
Japan and received for the Emperor the
congratulations of his subjects resident in
San Francisco.
The Japanese colony to the number of
4000 met yesterday at the tea garden, H
street and Seventh avenue, and began the
day's festivities in honor of the fifty-first
birthday of their imperial master, the
Mikado, Mutsuhlto.
The recreation ground was alive with
color, was gay with flag and streamer,
and a babbling of the voices of the loyal
and genial subjects of his imperial Ma
jesty filled the air.
American' and Japanese flags flapped
side by side and numerous United States
citizens assisted in the ceremonies.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 3.â Mrs. Jeanette
Gray, a Los Angeles woman, is preparing
to remarry Thomas H. Bradford, a prom
inent citizen of Grand Rapids, Mich.,
from whom she was divorced ten years
ago. She is also a member of a prominent
Grand Rapids family and the story of her
married life is curiously romantic.
Thomas Bradford \ and Jeanette Gray
were schoolmates back In Michigan years
ago. Things went along smoothly until
the parents and grandparents -of the
young woman concluded the friendship
was getting entirely too serious and de
termined to break it up. Young Bradford
was denied admission to the girl's home;
but they managed to meet frequently and
finally planned to elope, trusting the
girl's family would feel differently dis
posed toward the young man after the
wedding ceremony.
The relatives, instead of being forgiving,
were all the more bitter after the mar
riage and a wealthy grandmother issued
an ultimatum to the effect that unless
her granddaughter gave up her husband
she would give her fortune to charity in
stead of willing it to the granddaughter.
The grandmother to Los Angeles
and suffered a serious illness which prom
ised to end her life.
Bradford and his wife withstood the
Importunities of her relatives for a year
and then, supposing that the grandmother
had not long to live, agreed to separate,
he- returning to Michigan ami she after a
time securing a divorce on the ground of
desertion. The grandmother recovered
her health and lived nearly ten years.
She died only recently and left her.for
tune of $50,000 to her granddaughter.
Then Mrs. Gray telegraphed her husband
and suggested a remarriage. On Novem
ber 1!) they v/ill be married again in
Grand Rapids.

Collier Will Carry Coal From San
Diego to Panama.
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 3.â The first local ef
fect of the disturbance in Panama was
received this evening In the form of or
ders from the Navy Department to Cap
tain Shurtleff of the United States collier
Nero to leave for Panama with all pos
sible dispatch.
The Nero arrived here six days ago
with 3400 tons of coal from Philadelphia
for the use of the Pacific fleet, which was
expected Ito arrive here in a few weeks
from the south. The fleet went south
two weeks ago under command of Ad
miral Glass. The Marblehead, Concord
and Wyoming were ordered to Acapulco
and the Boston, though under sealed or
ders, was supposed to be on her way to
Panama to show the flag there and then
join the other ships at Acapulco and come
north. .
The revolution at Panama makes the
change In the plans necessary and the
three ships of the squadron will un
doubtedly be ordered to Join the Boston
at Panama, where the Nero will supply
them with coal.
NERO ORDERED SOUTH.
JAPAN'S RULER
SHOWN HONORS
According to his estimate, there are
less than 1000 Government troops in the
state of Panama at present. But. accord
ing to his latest Information there- are
STRENGTH OF COLOMBIA.
Dr. Thomas Herran, the Colombian
Charge, received his first information of
the revolution at Panama from the Asso
ciated Press. He was much interested,
but not surprised, as he has been aware
for some time of the desperate feeling of
the people of the isthmus and has gone
so far as to warn his Government that
some such occurrence was likely to take
place. Dr. Herran expects to get infor
mation from his Government very soon,
as In his judgment the revolution will not
interrupt cable communication with Bo
gota".
The rejection of the Panama Canal
treaty is generally supposed to be the
moving cause for the revolution, but no
official information on the subject was
obtained. After the conference the state
ment was authorized that the sole pur
pose for the dispatch of the vessels was
the protection of American Interests.
The most explicit instructions are being
cabled to-night to the American consuls
at Panama and Colon and to the com
mander of the Dixie, who is In charge of
the vessels on the Atlantic side, to direct
their movements with this end In view.
The further statement was authorized
that tho State Department regards the
situation as a serious one, but that the
arrival of the Nashville to-day and the
immediate dispatch of the other vessels
Insure3 the protection of American inter
ests.
WASHINGTON, Nov. S.â Sensational
advices were received to-night
from the Isthmus of Panama to
the effect that a revolution was in
progress and Independence had been pro
claimed. President Roosevelt at 9 o'clock
sent for Secretary Hay, Acting Secretary
of the Navy Darling, Assistant Secretary
of State Loomis and Admiral Taylor to
come to the White House, where, after
a conference lasting nearly two hours,
orders were dispatched to the Dixie and
the Atlanta, on the Atlantic side, and the
Boston on the Pacific Coast, to proceed
with all possible speed to isthmian waters
to aid the Nashville in protecting Amer
ican interests and maintaining a free
transit across the isthmus in accordance
with the treaty.
Orders were also sent to Rear Admiral
Glass, commanding the Pacific squadron,
consisting of the Concord, Marblehead
and Wyoming, at Acapulco, to coal im
mediately and hold its crew ready to pro
ceed on a moment's notice. When the
Baltimore reaches Santo Domingo orders
will be cabled to her to go to the isthmus
if the situation demands her presence.
CONSULS ABE INSTRUCTED.
The Baltimore is now on her way to
Santo Domingo because of an outbreak
and disturbed conditions, but upon her ar
rival at Santo Domingo probably will be
ordered to proceed to the isthmus. The
Dixie, it Is stated, has 400 marines on
board, a force that would come in very
handy in the event that It Is desired to
land a force on the Isthmus.
MARINES MAY LAND.
Shortly before 10 o'clock Lieutenant
Belknap, the cipher officer of the Bureau
of Navigation, came over from the Navy
Department to the White House bringing
a message. He was followed by Assist
ant Secretary Darling. There was a hur
ried conference between the President
and the two secretaries, following which
Lieutenant Belknap returned to the Navy
Department in great haste. A few min
utes after the conference Admiral Tay
lor, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation,
called and was immediately admitted to
the Cabinet room, where the President
was.
Dr. Herran does not expect any speedy
recognition by the United States of a
government formed at Panama, but real
izes that this Government will keep the
transit open on the railway and may find
it necessary in so doing to support any
government in the city of Panama that
is In control, which would be greatly to
the advantage of the revolutionists.
The state of Panama has a population
of about 250,000 people, and it is declared
is really the poorest portion of the re
public of Colombia. There has been some
sympathy with Panama and a trend to
ward independence of the states west of
the mountains on the Pacific side and
bordering on the Caribbean Sea on the
Atlantic side. These states are also in
terested In the construction of the canal,
while the people of Panama think the
canal is a life and death issue. Dr. Her
ran attributes the uprising to the intense
desire on the part of the people on the
isthmus for the construction of the canal,
and on this account fe&s that the move
ment is more serious than the attempted
revolutions heretofore.
The following cablegram was received
at the State Department to-night from
the United States Consul at Panama:
"An uprising took place at Panama to
night Independence was proclaimed. The
Colombian army and naval officials were
made prisoners. A Government was to
be organized consisting of three Consuls
and a Cabinet. It Is rumored at Panama
that a similar uprising was to take place
at Colon."
three Colombian Government warships on
the Pacific side of the isthmus and three
or four on the Atlantic side. The Gov
ernment has 60,000 troops , under arms in
the Interior and on the western coast and
these can be moved by transports to Pan
ama or vicinity, but could not be sent
overland.
When the White House conference
broke up at 11 o'clock not much beyond
the official telegram received and orders
given would be stated by those partici
pating in it. There is a very general be
lief that the rejection of the Panama
canal treaty by Colombia caused the peo
ple of the isthmus to decide to set up a
government of their own, but none of the
officials of the administration would au
thorize any statement to the effect that
this was the case.
Acting Secretary of the Navy Darling
made a statement regarding the location
of the United States ships likely to ba
called on for Isthmian service. He said:
"The Atlanta is now at Jamaica: the
Dixie is supposed to be in the vicinity of
Jamaica: the Nashville Is at Colon; Ad
miral Glass' squadron, comprising the
Marblehead, Wyoming and Concord, is at
Acapulco; the Boston is a little farther
down the coast at San Juan del Sur,
Nicaragua." .
The movements of these vessels, added
Mr Darling, will be directed by tbe Navy
Department pursuant to requests from
the State Department.
Thus far no Information has come to
the Government Indicating that our naval
officers, who have pretty broad authority
in such matters, have landed marines.
In fact, the early advices received by the
Navy Department merely stated that the
Nashville had arrived at Colon and that
the situation Is serious. In addition to
the orders given above orders were Is
sued to-night to the Atlanta to proceed
from Jamaica to Colon.
PANAMA, Colombia, Nov. 3.-â The independence of the isthmus was pro
claimed at 6 p. m. to-day. A large and enthusiastic crowd of all political
parties assembled and marched to the headquarters of the Government
troops, when General Tovar and General Amaya, who arrived this morning, were
imprisoned in the name of the Republic of Panama. The enthusiasm was im
mense and at least 3000 of the men in the gathering were armed. The battalion
of Colombian troops at Panama favors the movement, which is also thought to
meet with the approval of at least two of the Government transports now here.

would be regarding calling a special ses

"I am extremely reluctant about con

It is a question in my mind whether an
exhausted treasury will prove as great
an evil as a special session of the Oregon
Legislature.
"I cannot state definitely what course
I shall pursue until my return to Salem,

SpÂ«c!al Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
ALLENTOWN. Pa., Nov. 3.â "Was Ma*
bel H. Bechtsl murdered by her mother
and did Bechtel commit suicide to shield
his parent? This Is now the question that
has corns up In Allentown's latest trag
edy.
Chief of Police Eastman and local news
paper men both received to-day Identical
anonymous letters from Philadelphia
stating that Mrs. Bechtel was the mur
deress of her daughter. The police think
the letters may have been written by a
reiatlve of tho Bechtela, but are Inclined
to give credence to them. The letters read:
"I read in to-day's paper you are at a
standstill on the Bechtel case. I would
like to give my view of the case. Mrs.
Bechtel killed the girl. Tom carried her
to the basement and probably, too, tna
boys did not know anything about the
murder until the body was found. The
girls were told next day. This Is my view:
when the girl arrived home on Sunday
night her mother commenced to quarrel
and the girl told her she would leave
home for good, which enraged the mother
more than ever." <
The lettera advance the theory that the
mother took a hatchet to frighten the
girl. In the quarrel Mabel was struck and
killed. Then there was a family confer
ence and a decision to remove the body
and shield the mother.
The letter further says:
"If Tom killed the girl he would have
confessed to have the mother found out
and convicted for murder. I suggest you
get the old woman to your room alone on
some excuse, then send word to both
girls that she has confessed all and is
all broken up and see what will happen."
Not a word which could be construed as
even a partial confession has been uttered
by any of the Bechtels.
GRAVESTONE QUESTION

Contractor Furnishes Headpieces for
a Paupers' Cemetery, but Is
Not Paid.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 3.-Distrlct Attorney
Casslus Carter, by rendering an opinion
contrary to the opinion rendered by his
predecessor, T. L. Le wis# re i atlve to the
furnishing of grave stones for paupers
has introduced complications which will'
probably involve the county In a law
suit. Some time ago the county entered
into a contract with J. B. Westgate for
o50 stones at $2 50 each, to be set at pau
pers' graves. It was also contracted that
he should furnish stones in the future as
occasion demanded, at the same rate.'
Westgate recently furnished two stones
and sent in his bill for J5. District At
torney Carter gave to the Board of Su
pervisors his opinion that the account was
not one which the county could pay
claiming that burial expenses and funeral
expenses were not synonymous terms and
that the law allowing the county to bury
the dead did not give authority to incur
expenses of a marker for the grave. The
opinion is met with disfavor by the
Board of Supervisors, which, however
does not dare, under the circumstances!
to audit Westsrate's bills.

Nome October 25 the season of navigation
ended and the far northern camp is iso
lated frcm steamship communication with
the outside world for at least seven
months.
The Oregon and Corwin got away none
too soon, for the harbor was filled with
floating Ice not coming from the Arctic,
but forming in the shoals along shore
and stretching out over the sea The
weather was growing colder daily and a
solid freeze was due any night.
The Oregon arrived here to-day, coming
by way of Dutch Harbor. The Corwin
was also to make Dutch Harbor and then
come down the inside passage, arriving
here probably Saturday. The Oregon to
day completed her sixth round trip of
the season, a feat never before accom
plished. During the season she has
transported Â£425 passengers, SOOO tons of
freight and $2,000,000 in gold.
The winter population of Nome and vi
cinity is variously estimated at from
2500 to 3500. considerably less than last
winter, but conceded to be a better work
ing force, as all are actively engaged in
mining or business. The country is bet

than ever before.

Â£pÂ«ci*I DUjcrca to Tb* CUL
VICTORIA, B. C, Nor. 3.â Out on thÂ«
rocky coaBt which fringes the western
shores cf Vancouver Island, fishermen.
In the pursuit of their calling, have made
& discovery full of melancholy interest.
Lying in twenty-five fathoms off Amphi
tritÂ© Point, at the western entrance to
B&rkJey Sound, lies the wreck of an iron
vessel. TVhat the vessel is or how long she
has lain there may never be determined,
for the depth of water in which she lies
Is so great that divers do not care to take
the risks which a descent to the stranded
hull will involve.
The existence of the derelict does not
rest upo^i the unsupported testimony of
cue man. Several fishermen have en
countered it in trolling, their lines fouling
the obstruction. That the wreck Is that
of an iron craft is demonstrated by the
fact that their lines, when drawn to the
surface after being cleared of the ob
struction, were marked with rust and
Iron stains.
The location of the wreck is about five
miles from shore, and the facts in con
nection with the matter have been called
to the attention of the Agent of Marine
end Fisheries, Captain Gaudin, by J. Sut
ton, who has large interests on the west
coast and to whom the fishermen commu
nicated the nature of the discovery they
have made.
The vessel may either have struck near
where the lies, or she may have found
ered and been carried by the tides which
set so strong' coastward In these waters,
to where she is now resting. She may
easily be one of half a dozen vessels
which have (rone down in that latitude in
the last year or two. Captain Gaudin
Is naturally anxious to obtain more infor
mation on the subject, and on hearing: the
news communicated the facts to Rear Ad
miral Bickford, in command of the squad
ron at Esquimalt, at the same time inti
mating that there is a possibility of its
being the lost Condor, the sloop of war
which went to the bottom' with her gal
lant crew of over 100 men in the Decem
ber gale of nearly two years ago. It is
possible that the authorities at Esqui
ma!t may take steps by dragging or oth
<rwiÂ«Ms to attempt to bring to the surface
something to identify the craft which lies
so far beneath the surface of the waters.
The presence of the submerged hulk on
the coast will recall many horrors of the
Ffa. The big collier Matteawan, with 4S50
tons of coal on board, for San Francisco;
the Keewenaw and Montserrat, colliers,
p.r.d other craft have been among the
known wrecks on that coast. There is a
possibility that the wreck is one or other
of the colliers, but -what strengthens the
i<ea that the wreck is that of the Con
dor, lost on December 3, 1901, is that
wreckage from the lost cruiser was found
probably not fifty miles from where the
submerged vessel lies.

Owing to the ever Increasing volume
of Eastern freight which is being shipped
to this city, the facilities for handling
freight at Sixteenth street depot are be
coming abeolutely inadequate, and the
Express and Dray Men's Association has
appealed to the Board of Trade request
ing that body to take some action that
will result in the betterment of existing
conditions.'
Following Is the communication:
Oakland Board of Trade. Edwin Stearns,
Secretary, 5UU Twelfth street. Oaklandâ r>ai;
Sir: The Express and Dray Men's AsÂ«ociat on
wish to call your honorable body a attention
to thÂ« prenent condition* existing at the blx
. teenth-etreet depot. Many of the merchants
have been complaining to the express and
dray men of the delay in receiving Eastern
freight. The accommodations at Sixteenth
street depot for the hanfillng of freight are not
commensurate with the volume of business to
be handled. Carload lots have lain for thirty
days on sidetrack; the trackage la limited and
altogether Inadequate for the accommodation
of the freight to be handled. Two hours' time
is consumed each morning and one hour each
afternoon ewltching. Said time is a loss to
the draymen, as no work can be done while
cars are being switched. Cars with Eastern
freight enclosed have lain three weeks on side
track, causing loss of thirty-day dating for
cash to merchants, which causes considerable
complaint to draymen, who are powerless ( to
remedy the same. We think K thla matter
was brought to the attention of Mr. Palmer
of the Southern Pacific Company by your hon
orable body we certainly believe the matter
would receive prompt attention. Any action
you may see fit to take to better the condi
tions above mentioned, thereby benefiting the
merchants, will be greatly aPP reclated ; 1I( Ir u^'
tng you will give the matter your earliest at
tention, we beg to remain yours very respect

the hillside. The helpless rider \ras

him was the thick brush, which impeded

Within a month the chicken experts^ of
the Agricultural Department of the Uni
versity of California have benefited the
State the $2500 w\rth that its Legislature
appropriated last year for the establish
ment of a poultry station. In other words,
the poultry station has paid for itself,
even before it has been built.
A Marin County rancher, whose name
ia not given out at the university, had
2700 chickens a month ago. To-day he
has none. They were all destroyed within
a week by the disease that chicken ex
perts call "cholera," though this is not
the technical name for it. The chickens
were worth U apiece, so the raiser last
$2700. Another rancher had a poultry
ranch right next and he has 2300 chickens.
His chickens did not escape the scourge
and he "stood to lose" $2500. The fowls
began to drop off at the rate of forty and
fifty a day and in a little while they
would have all been dead, as the death
rate Increased every day. In his despera
tion, however, he thought of the univer
sity experts and he communicated with
Professor A. R. Ward, the chief. Dr.
Ward, assisted by H. W. Woodworth.
looked into the trouble then and after a
hard fight Bucceeded in getting the dis
ease under control. Ward received
word from the second ranch to-day that
the "cholera" had been almost entirely
wiped out, thus showing how nearly 2500
fowls and tftat many dollars were saved.
The "cholera" is the terror of the poul
try raisers. It is a germ disease that
spreads rapidly and kills the chicken*
off in the night. It is spread by the live
chickens eating the dead ones and the
contamination of the water. The chief
preventives are spraying with disinfec
tants, sanitary feeding troughs and medi
cated drinking water.

Arrangements for the funeral were
completed to-day. It will be held from
the family residence to-morrow afternoon
at 2 o'clock and will be private. The
body will be cremated.
Dr. T. P. Tisdale, who attended Pariser
prior to his demise, said that the patient
was unable to account for the terrible
pains in his stomach, but remarked that
they might have been caused by some
thing he ate. The physician diagnosed
Pariser's trouble as ptomaine Â¦ poisoning,
and treated him for it, but was unable
to stay its deadly progress. A. D. Pariser,
a son of the deceased, told of his father's
plight when the latter reached home.
After hearing the evidence, the Jury re
paired to the Pariser residence, on Cen

found to be the cause of the death of
James A. Pariser, who passed away at
his home here last evening. An autopsy
performed by Dr. Charles L. Tisdale dis
closed the presence of the deadly pto
maines in the stomach of the deceased.
The physician so testified at the Inquest

marn, and the jury returned a verdict
in accordance with the postmortem find
ings.
J. A. HSnterman. the waiter who served
Pariser In the restaurant, testified that
the dish of meat of which Pariser partook
was a favorite one with the deceased and
that Pariser, after eating heartily of it,
recommended it to several acquaintances

VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 3.â The
Japanese here are preparing for war with
Rr.Fsfa. Letters they have received from
t!Kir countrymen at home have so con
vinced them that a conflict is imminent
that they have begun active preparations
for the formation and equipment of a
reslxaent of at least 800 men from British
Columbia. In Japan the laws of conscrip
tion are very strict. If Japanese now
resident in British Columbia did not re
turn to the country's aid in case of war
they would be to arrest and im
prisonment if they returned to Japan at
any later time. The 5000 Japanese are not
wanting In patriotic enthusiasm, however,
and are anxious to go or send representa
tives to fight the Russians. To-day
speeches wcre made to the. Vancouver
Japanese en the war question and the
Japanese are simply itching for a fight.
Individually the Japanese are very brave
or.d have no fear of encountering death In

The City Council has passed to print
an ordinance which calls for bids for the

the establishing of a modern electrical
system of handling the delicate mech

COLD KILLS THE GERM.
Lieut. Perry Says There Axe No Bald
Heads in the Arctic Region. ,
The people who come back from Klon-
dike testify to the fact that no native
bald heads are there. The evidence is
that the cold climate kills the germs
that eat the , hair off at the root. Lieut.
Perry, ydio went to the Arctic Regions,
gives % trie same evidence. Newbro's
Herplcide has the same effect as the cold
climate. It kills the germ that eats the
hair off at the roots, and the hair grows
again. Herpicide is the first hair rem-
edy built upon the principle of destroy-
ing the germ that eats the, hair off. Its
phenomenal sale demonstrates the cor-
rectness of the scalp germ theory. Sold
by leading druggists. Send 10c in stamps

KANSAS CITY, Nov. 3.â In a decision
in thc United States District Court Judge
John F. Phillips has held that insurance
companies may enforce the anti-suicide
clause, which was previously entered Into
by the insured.
The decision was in the case of James
"Whitfield. a well known newspaper sport
ine editor, who killed himself. Whitfield
insured for J5000, receiving a policy that
contained a clause specifying that $500
only should be recovered In case of sui
cide. Although the statutes of Missouri
declare that insurance companies may not
mako suicide a defense in refusing to pay
a policy. Judge Phillips held that "as the
pleading of the contract in question vol
untarily entered into by the parties goes
merely to the question of the amount of
the recovery and not to defeat a recov
ery my conclusion is that the plaintiff
is only entitled to recover the sum of
$300."

THE ANTI-SUICIDE CLAUSE
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â The Commis
sioner of Indian Affairs has received tele
grams from Senator Warren of Wyom
ing and Agent Brennan of tac Pine Ridge
Agency, giving further retails concerning
the recent fatal encounter between Wy
oming officers and Indians. Brennan says
the Indians engaged were from Pine
Ridge, and therefore were Sioux. The
party, according to hl3 statement, was
small and was traveling through Wyom
ing on a permit. He also says that Sher
iff Wilson and one of his posse were
reported killed and also one of the In
dians. Brennan attributes the fignt to
a charge made by the officers for the pur
pose of arresting the Indians. He said
that he would go to Newcastle, the coun
ty seat of Weston County, in which the
tight took place, to investigate. Senator
Warren said in his teieeram that six
Indians were ed, six wounded and
about the same number captured. He
confirms the report of the death of the
Sheriff. One of the party named South,
who Is still at large, Is, he says, a stu
dent. There were two fights, one on Fri
day or Saturday and the other on Sun
day. The under sheriff is still in pursuit
of the Indians, and the latter have been
reinforced.
"It looks squally," says the Senator In
his message "and I fear further trou
ble." He suggests a close watch on the
Indians at the agencies for fear of still
more serious consecuences.
Close Watch Is Seing Kept on the
Several Agencies in Wyoming.

Five Indians, including the notorious
Eagle Feather, were killed and five badly
wounded. The Indians then scattered
and struck out for the Dakota line. There
were twenty-two bucks and thirty-six
squaws and children in the party.
Sheriff McDermott of Weston County,
Deputy Cook and a posse of twenty cow
boys from Douglas and LuskÂ»are in pur
suit of the Indians.
LUSK, Wyo.. Nov. 3.â Posses^ are re
turning from the scene of the fight with
the Indians, but some are still in pursuit.
A posse from Lusk assisted to bury at
the scene of the battle Eagle Feather,
who was also known as Chief Smith:
Black Kettle, Gray Bear and an Indian
boy who were killed during the fight. Ea
gle Feather's squaw was shot in the left
shoulder and will die.
DOUGLAS, Wyo., Nov. 3. â John Norton,
a member of the Douglas posse, says that
the Indians have separated and that each
party is taking a different trail. It is
the opinion of many of the officers that
the redskins who are yet at large cannot
be caught until they return to the reser
vation. However, it is believed that many
of them will not return for fear of arrest
and that they will continue to the Bad
Lands in Northwestern Nebraska.
DOUGLAS, Wyo., Nov. 3.â County At
torney Mecume ,has, returned, from the
Beaver Dams on Lightning Creek with
part'ciilara of the recent trouble with the
Indians. The fight occurred Sunday even
ing. â¢ Sheriff Miller of .Newcastle, former
Sheriff Owens and a posse of eight men;
had followed the, Sioux, who were fromlj
the Pine Rldee Agency, to the Beaver |
Dams with warrants for their. arrest for
unlawfully killing game. â¢ The Indians |
refused to surrender and the posse al- j
lowed them to pass, and, securing four ;
additional deputies, headed off the In- j
dlans in a valley at the Beaver Dams and :
demanded their surrender. The Indians, j
led by Charley Smith, otherwise known i
as Eagle Foather, without replying shot j
and killed Deputy Falkenburgh. The ,
shooting then became general and Sheriff \
Miller was shot in the hip, dying from i
the wounds. . ; .
PARIS. Nov. 3.â The reports that Pre
mier Combes intended to resign became
more persistent this afternoon, following
! the action of M. Jaurcs, the Socialist
; leader, in notifying the President of the
j Council cf his intention to interpellate the
1 Government on the subject of strikes In
j the northern spinning district, but M.
j Combes himself maintains entire silence
i on the subject. While the retirement of
I M. Combes is likely to occur later, the
j Premier has not yet announced his Inten
tion to do so and there is no present in
j dication that his retirement is imminent.
In the Chamber of Deputies, after a de-
I bate marked by the conciliatory attitude
i cf all parties, a bi.l was passed by a vote
! of -ISO to 6 for the suppression of the em
j ployment bureaus within five years. By
] the terms of the bill indemnities are
j granted to the owners at the cost of the
. communes in which bureaus are situated,

The question of why one man succeeds
I and another fails, is a problem that has
J puzzled the philosophers for centuries.
j One man attains riches and position,
; while his neighbor who started with
! seemingly the same, and better opportu-
i nities. exists In poverty and obscurity.
! No man can win success who is suffering
; from an irritating and nerve racking dis-
ease and the man who has the qualities
of success within him, would be quick
to recognize this fact and seize the best
i remedy t^ eradicate the trouble.
A person afflicted with a serious case
i of hemorrhoids or plies is handicapped
i in the race for power and advancement.
j It is impossible to concentrate the men-
I tal energies when this dreadful trouble
| is sapping the vital forces. To show
i how easily this success destroying
! trouble can be overcome, we publish the
; /oKowlng letter from a prominent Indi-
i ana man:
"AVhen I received the former letter
; and booklet on 'Piles, their nature, cause
1 and cure.' I was in a critical condition;
: ulcers to the number of seven had
i formed on the inside of the rectum, cul-
j minating In a large tumor on the out-
j side resembling fistula. I suffered the
most excruciating pain, could get no rest
day or night. After reading the booklet
I sent to my druggist but he happened
to be out of Pyramid Pile Cure Just at
that time. However, I obtained a part
: of a box from my brother-in-law and
j began their use. Five pyramids com-
j pletely cured me. I procured a box
j latÂ«r. but have had no occasion to use
j them. I have been waiting to see that
j the cure was permanent, before writing
you of Its success. I believe Pyramid
Pile Cure to be the greatest and best pile
! cure on the market and ask you to
please accept of my grateful thanks for
this invaluable remedy. I take great
pleasure in recommending its use to any
sufferer along this line. You may use
; my name if you wish for reference .to
; any one afflicted with this disease." J

MAKES BIG HEALTY DEAL
ON CALIFORNIA STREET
E. W. Newhall Buys Property in Two
Pieces for Which He Pays
?32O,QO0.
E. W. Newhall has purchased two
pieces of property on California street,
west of the Bank of California, for which
he has paid $320,000. The first of the prop
erties to be acquired has been recently
mentioned. This belonged to Robert F.
though heavier than the collegians, the
soldiers were unable to cope with the
fierce onslaughts of the lighter and faster
team. Of the four touchdowns two were
made in each half and two goals were
kicked. Magee, the college halfback,
played a great game and tore through
the soldier line for big gains. Captain
Feeney of the college team went into the
contest quite ill and retired early during
the first half after making two long,
sensational runs.

GOVERNOR OF OREGON
FAILS AT WASHINGTON
uovernment Will Not Grant Request
in Important Land
Cases.
SALEM, Or.. Nov. 3.â Governor Cham
berlain returned to this city this evening
from Washington. D. C. The principal
purpose of his visit was to secure for pur
chasers of State lieu lands upon titles
which have failed a preference right to
secure the land with scrip or otherwise.
The Governor is disappointed at his fail
ure to secure the granting of this prefer
ence, for selections of many thousand
acres of lieu lands which were sold by the
State have since been rejected by the
Federal Government and the purchasers
are about to lose their property.
The Governor says that If the depart
ment will carry out its recently an
nounced intention of not creating perma
nent forest reserves until the scrip laws
have been properly amended, hÂ© will have
no further objection to the creation of
the reserves where there Is valuable tim
ber to be preserved. He will, however,
protest against the creation of perma
nent reserves which will increase the
amount of scrip.

SAN FRANCISCO may adopt a
new system of registering votes.
Several patent voting machines
have been constructed, and two
or three of them have reached
a state of perfection that makes "crooked
work" practically an impossibility.
One of the most perfect of these in
struments 13 what is known as the V, S.
Standard voting machine. One of these
machines has been on exhibition for the
last week in an election booth on Hyde
and McAllister streets, and many expert
mechanics have visited the booth to try
to beat the machine. Each one has ad
mitted that it Is impossible to do so.
Not only is the machine a great bene
fit to voters for the reason that they art
assured of a fair deal but because it will
enable the city to know the returns of
the elections within a few minutes after
the booths are closed.
During the municipal election In Buf
falo in the year 1S0O these machines were
used. Sixty thousand votes were cast,
and thirty-seven minutes after the polls
closed the total vote had been counted.
In Portland, Or., last year there were
28,000 votes cast. The election was close,
and it was twenty-four hours before the
result was known. The machine was not
in use during the election.
The cost of these machines is small.
and the number of poll clerks will be

had a number of workers In the vicinity

were doing all in their power to gain
votes for him. Herman Stein failed to sat

but subsequently released on bail.
CROCKER'S DISTRICT.
In the Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, For
tieth and Forty-first Assembly districts,
which includes the territory north of
Market street and west of Van Ness ave
nue, the votes arrived early at the polls
and by noon the great majority had cast
their ballots. In these districts a careful
estimate would place the vote at about
SO per cent of the number who had reg
istered and were eligible. In several of
the precincts the voting was practically
all done before 9 o'clock. Everything was
quiet and no disorder of any kind took
place. Every saloon and grocery bar
was closed tight. as a drum and politicians
and voters alike had to go thirsty until
5 o'clock, when the voting booths prompt
ly closed and the saloons opened with
equal alacrity.
In the Thirty-first, Thirty-second, Thir
ty-third. Thirty-fourth and Thirty-fifth
Assembly districts a large vote was polled.
In many cases nine-tenths of the voters
registered cast their ballots.
There was not a. single arrest during
the day in the Mission beyond Tenth
street for any infraction of the election
laws. Every booth had a peaceful re
port to make and when the polls closed
at 5 o'clock every one was of the opinion
that the city had just witnessed one of
the most quiet elections ever held within
its boundaries.
With the exception of a word y war be
tween a supporter of Schmitz and an ad
herent of Crocker, the election passed off
A large vote was registered in every
precinct in the various districts in the
Mission yesterday. The day was espec
ially devoid of any trouble around the
different booths. By noon the largest
number of voters had cast their ballots
and all in a very orderly manner.
IN THE MISSION BELT.
Mayor Schmitz had workers around ev
ery booth, who watched the officials and
discussed the Mayor's chances of re-elec
tion.
The police had things easy. Not one
arrest was recorded. Owing to the sa
loons being closed, there were no intoxi
cated men on the streets. Officers re
ported In every precinct that they had
not had occasion to drive men away for
soliciting votes or for interference. The
workingmen voted before going to work
and at noon time.
A light vote was cast south of Market.
In almost every precinct the votes fell
short. The election was the quietest held
in that section of the city in years. Very
few politicians hung around the booths.
Voters came and went without being im
portuned for their votes. A report came
from the Ruef crowd that the officials
in the booths on Folsom street, between
Second and Third streets, were intoxi
cated. Registrar Walsh went there and,
much to his satisfaction, found every of
ficer in the booth, and sober.

city.
Owing to alleged irregularities in the
polling places in the Fourth, Seventh and
Thirteenth precincts of the Forty-four
Assembly District, located at the What
Cheer House corner of Pine and Mont
gomery streets and Grant avenue, near
Putter street. President Voorsanger of the
Election Commission ordered the swear
ing in of twenty-five additional deputies
late yesterday afternoon. The men were
ordered to take up their stations at the
three booths and instructed to see that
there v.as a fair count and that the elec
tion ofiicers should not be interfered with
In the discharge of their duties.
It was openly charged that attempts
â¢were hfins made to vote the names of
men who had been marked on* as moved
from the What Cheer House. In one
case, at least, the attempt appears to
have been successful. Supervisor Wilson
reported to Registrar Walsh that a man
named Roberts was denied a vote by the
â¢ lection officers because his name had
already been voted. Roberts demonstrat
ed that he was the real Roberts and on
instructions from the Registrar's office
he was permitted to cast his vote. Thus
two votes were credited to Roberts.
The Registrar removed two election of
ficers in the precinct because of incom
petency. The judges were instructed to
compare the signature of the intending
voter with his affidavit of registration,
and no more complaints were received.
The three precincts named were visited
by all the politicians during the after-
FORTY-FOURTH DISTRICT.
Some complaints were made against a
{jew election officers and Registrar Walsh
v.as promptly on hand to straighten out
the misunderstandings between voters
and the election officials.
All was ouiet throughout the day in
ih* Forty-nfth Assembly District. The
voting was heavy until shortly after the
noon hour, when It slackened in some of
the precincts. On the whole a fair vote
nas cast. There were rumors of money

ers were in line before the polls opened.
It being Abe Ruef's stronghold, the bal

not discourage the toilers for the other
candidates. Jt was generally conceded

would carry the district. , There were
fourteen polling places and all report that
a good percentage of votes in the pre

NEW MAYOR'S STATEMENT
McClellan, who is at present a member
of Congress, made the following state
ment:
To-day's result shows a tremendous
change of public sentiment since Mayor
Low's election two years ago, when he
won by 31.632. At that time he carried all
the boroughs but Queens, his plurality
In Manhattan and the Bronx being 5663;
in Brooklyn. 25,767, and in Richmond 736.
To-day McClellan carries Manhattan
and the Bronx by about 58,000, a gain of
23,000; Brooklyn by 6000, a gain of 31,000,
and Queens by about 5000, a gain of more
than 4000. This means a total net gain
for McClellan of about 103,000, as com
pared â¢with Shepard's vote of two years
ago.
Low carried only one boroughâRich
mondâby about 200 votes.
The result was known early and at 8:15
o'clock Mayor Low sent a telegram of
congratulation to McClellan.
A surprise was the low vote for 'William
Devery, former Commissioner of Police,
who ran on the independent ticket, which
was given practically no support.
TAMMANY'S BIO GAIN.
tically every minister of relig
ion in this city, George B. McClellan, son
of the Civil "War general, was elected the
third Mayor of Greater New York over
Beth Low, Fusionlst, the present Mayor,
by a plurality of about 70,000.
Edward M. Grout was elected Comp
troller and Charles V. Fornes president of
the Board of Aldermen. These two men
were originally on the Fusion ticket and
were Indorsed by Tammany, whereupon
the Fuslonists took their names from the
Low ballots and nominated other candi
dates. It was the nomination of Grout
and Fornes by Tammany that caused
McL&ughJ&i, the veteran leader of the
Kings County Democracy, . to bolt and
declare that he would not support men
who were not Democrats. In spite of
McLaughlln's defection, McClellan. Grout
and Fornes carried Kings County. The
management of their campaign was tak
en over by State Senator Patrick McCar
ren when McLaughlin refused to aid.

"I invite the co-oneratlon of every cit

advancement of the city's good.
"This victory should encourage and
unite all Democrats for the Presidential
contest in 1904."
Charles F. Murphy, they leaderof Tarn
many Hall, eaid:
"The figures speak for themselves and
the people have spoken. Of course we are
pleased at the result. It bears out tfc"e
figures we give. If the election had been
a week farther off the chances are that
Devery would have polled a larger votd
than Low."
CUTTING' IS ASTONISHED.
Robert Fulton Cutting, at the Citizens'
Union headquarters, gave out a statement
in which he expressed his astonishment
over the result and his belief that "the
partisan administration which Mr. Mc-
Clellan proposes cannot maintain the
standard set by Mr. Low."
Meanwhile, he cays, the Citizens* Union
will occupy itself in preparing 1 for the
next election. He is persuaded that Its
services will bÂ» required at*that time.
"With Commissioner Greene at police
headquarters watching the returns was
District Attorney Jerome. "When the elec
tion of McClellan was assured Jerome was
asked if he had anything to say.
"Not a funeral note," he replied.
Later, however, a statement which he
had made before Low was nominated. In
which he said that the Mayor, if renom
inated, would be beaten by a majority of
from 25,000 to 40,000. was shown to him.
"That was my calm judgment then." he
said, "but when I got into the fight my

who made up the Democratic ticket and
managed the campaign. Defeat to-day
would have meant for him deposition f rom
his post of leader, with' all its powers and
opportunities, and the accession of an
other faction to control. Indeed, plans
had been made by certain Independent
Democrats, based on the belief that Low
would bo re-elected, to reorganize tho
Democracy of the city with Tammany left
out.
To McCarren, also, the result meant
much, for, had McClellan lost. McLaugh
lln would have been again in control and
MeCarren and his friends would have had
little to hope for. The carrying of Brook
lyn for McClellan caused astonishment, as
it was believed that the cry of "No red
lights in Brooklyn" would cause an in
creased vote for Low in that borough.
The campaign was one of the most in
teresting In the history of New York City.
From the day Mayor Low was renomi
nated his supporters urged his re-elec
tion on the ground that no partisan ques
tion was involved, but that every man
should vote to uphold the existing ad
ministration, because it had given the city
a businesslike conduct of affairs and be
cause It had done much to stamp out ths
"red light" evil of the East Side.
It was argued by fusion 1st orators that
the return of Tammany men to office
would mean a "wide open town," unre
stricted in lawlessness and the renewed
terrors of the Infamous "cadet system."
by which ignorant girls were brought to
disgrace. McClellan was attacked by the
speakers for the fuslonists because they
alleged he had sold the name of his hon
ored father to cloak the designs of evil
men.
To these statements the- Democrats re
sponded with the charges that Low's non-
alded forth to the waiting mass by The
Call bulletins, full three minutes ahead
of any of the other papers.
When the Mayor's picture was placed
before the stereopticon a second later the
crowd gave vent to a mighty cheer, and
when the green fire from the dome of
the mammoth building glared -forth into
the fog of the night the air was rent with
shouts from the waiting crowd below.
The Call's bulletin service was perfect.
Trained men were kept on duty at the
various places where the returns came in
and they telephoned them to the i main
office of the paper. As quick as the mes
sages were received they .were placed on
the slides and hurried to the stereopticon
and given to the crowd below.
In the dispatch and accuracy with
which the bulletins were given to the
crowd The Call led the other papers
right through the evening. From, the time
the first bulletin was cast upon' the
ecreen until the last returns were in The
Call's rapid bulletin service gave to the
assemblage the first and most accurate
returns from the polls.
It was just 10:<5 when the information
that Schmitz had been victorious was her-
jammed together that breathing was dif
ficult. As each succeeding bulletin was
thrown on the screen shouts of joy and
cheers went up from the throats of those
of the open-air audience to whose favorite
candidate the returns gave the best re-
BUltS.
THOUSANDS of struggling, squirm
ing people crowded Market Btreet
in front of the Call building last
night to view the bulletin* of the
election returns.
People struggled and fought for places
of vantage that they might see the re
turns. Through the vast crowd the cable
and trolley c/.rs crept with snail's pace.
Scores of blue-coated policemen wended
their way in and out of the chaotic mass,
stopping some excited individual from
shoving, clearing the tracks of congested
humanity, restoring order.
Directly In front of the Call building
the crowd was densest. People were bo
From the dome of the Call building the
street had the appearance of being over
run with a shapeless, moving mass. The
crowd extended from Kearny street to
Grant avenue and filled every niche and
corner of the street and sidewalks. The
buildings on the north side of the street
were,Mled with spectators, every window
was black with anxious people and the
roofs were covered.
The street cars, driving their way slow
ly through the mass, were buried to the
middle with" this vast collection of hu
manity. Here and there moving currents
of people could be seen threading their
way up and down the street in an almost
vain effort to get nearer to the bulletins
or to extract themselves from the mob.
Many Thousand Surging, Struggling People Crowd Street to View The Call's Bulletins.
The crowd collected early, and all
through the evening hours seemed to
thicken rather than to thin out The air
rang continuously with its cheers. At VI
o'clock. there were still as many in front
of The Call bulletins as ever. Late into
the night they stayed, craning their necks
and eagerly reading each bulletin, and
did not disperse until the last bulletin
was flashed upon the screen. Then, with
a mighty shout, the followers of the last
and next Mayor started up the street In
a mad exhillaratlon of joy.

Cost of Libraries.
- Carnegie libraries cost something:. Mr.
Carnegie recently said: "I have helped
found 760 libraries and have SOO more un
der advisement." This will make, say,
1500 in all. During the last year he gave
158 library buildings, at a cost to him of
J6.679.000. so the average cost of the build
ings is $42,270. and 1500 of them will aggre
gate ?63.405.000. kN'ow, under the contract
with Mr. Carnegie, the cities blessed must
tax themselves annually 10 per cent of the
cost of the buildings to provide funds for
-the maintenance. This would be $6,J10,500
every year. In addlton to the interest on
more than $30,000,000 paid by the cities for
libtTfy sites. By these transactions the
libraries will cost Mr. Carnegie each year,
at 5 per cent interest on his investment'
$3,170,250. while the cost to the cities at
the same rate will be .$7,840,500, or two
and a half times as mâ¬ch.â Kansas City

Maximum Speed.
An electric car running on the Marion
felde-Zossen experimental line In Ger
many reached, on October 6. a speed of
125 4-5 miles an hour. Passengers are car
ried at that rate, and live to tell about it.
The car used has four motors havtr.g be
tween them about 1100 horsepower. Fur
ther experiments are likely to show
speeds considerably higher, and th:> at
tainment of c. velocity of 130 miles an hoar
-Is not unlikely. Whether this is to be the
speed of fast trains on future railroads 13
open to discussion. The limit to possible
speed no discerning observer is ready to
define yet. The limit of speed at which
passengers will ever consent to be hauled
or railroad companies can ever afford to
haul them will probably be considerably
lower, but the facts are not yet forth
coming for the calculation of even that.â

New Gun.
: "The new gun Is an exceptionally pow
! erful and efficient weapon," says the Lon
1 don Telegraph. "It has an extreme range
j of 10,000 yards and a rate of fire of twen
j ty-nine rounds per minute. The improved
1 time fuse permits of effective shrapnel
I tire at a range of 3100 yards, an enor
; mous advance on anything possible with
I our present type of field gun. There are
I four special points in which the new type
I surpasses tne old. These are simplicity
I of the breech action, in which the inter
rupted screw is abolished: Increased
range, vastly increased rapidity of fire
and perfect absorption of the recoil. In
the old type of gun a coned steel block,
carrying an interrupted screw thread, was
used to close the breech and intricate
and comparatively delicate mechanism
was necessary to work it quickly, while
the danger of burring or injuring the
screw threads when Inserting the shell
necessitated an amount of care which ma
terially interfered with the rapid loading
of the gun. The new breech, which Is
the invention of Colonel Deport of the
French artillery, entirely obviates these
difficulties. Instead of a threaded cone,
worked by a complicated system of levers
and ratchets, there will be in the new
gun a plain steel disc, swinging on a pivot.
"When the crank handle attached to
the disc is pulled the disc slides around,
so that a cartridge can be Inserted in
the bore, a reversal of the motion closes
the breech and fires the gun, the whole
operation occupying less than a second of
time when performed by well trained gun
ners. The writer saw a French gun de
tachment fire eight rounds in fifteen sec
onds for the benefit of the Czar of Rus
sia at Fort de Fresne, near Rhelms, and
thirty rounds have been fired In one'min
ute by a picked squad at the French
School of Gunnery. This extreme rapid
ity Is effected by the adoption of an auto
matic attachment, which fires the gun
the instant the disc has swung Into posi
tion and closed the breech. When a slow
er rate of fire is required, as in ranging,
the automatic action is put out of gear
by a very simple arrangement, and the
gun can then be fired by pulling a lan
yard, which releases" the striker In the
ordinary way. An exactly sim.lar breech
mechanism ha.s been adopted by the Ad
miralty for heavy guns, and weapons
manufactured In" future will be fitted with
it. In opening the breech after the shot
has*been fired an extractor grips the
rim of the exploded cartridge case and
jerks It out, so as to leave the gun ready
for the next round. Fixed ammunition
that Is, the cartridge and the shell joined
In one piece, like a rifle cartridgeâ will,
of course, be used for the new gun."
Innovation Prophesied.
A professor who Is said to be an in
structor at the Naval Academy has been
telling people in Chicago that libraries
will soon be made up of "talWing ma
chine disks." In a lecture out 'there he
Is reported to have said:
"In time these disks will take the place
of textbooks. Paper backed novels will
disappear and instead of reading printed
books the student will only have to put a
disk in his talking machine and have the
novel read to him in the living voice ot
its creator.
"The new method will be especially val
uable to those who teach languages. It
will overcome the necessity of linguists
wasting time in teaching pronunciation '
By the use of the talking machine it has
been shown that the pronunciation of for
eign words can be taught" In a short time
with accuracy unequaled by any other
method. We have disks here on which
are lessons in French and Spanish spoken
by professors. When a student mispro
nounces a word it is only necessary to
refer him to a certain disk."
WE are not informed as to the exact crime com
mitted by the British subject, Lynchehaun, whose
extradition has been refused by the United States
Commissioner at Indianapolis. The crime is admitted by
the Commissioner to have been brutal, but he insists that
it was political in its nature, and the accused is therefore
not subject to extradition. This decision is probably a blun
der that may weaken the whole international system of ex
tradition. There is no revolution in progress in Great
Britain, and personal assaults under such circumstances
lose all political color in the supreme right of the people
to protection in their personal rights. This country, since
the political assassination of President McKinley, has en
deavored to create an international understanding in re
gard to the treatment of anarchists. This has depended
upon general recognition of the fact that, in the absence of
revolutionary conditions and when Governments have inter
nal peace, personal assault and assassination is an act of
anarchy.
It is none the less so if committed upon the person ot a
lesser official than the chief executive of a nation, or if even
a private citizen or subject be its victim. We had .one other
noted case before this of Lynchehaun, but with, features en
tirely different. The Ezeta brothers murdered and fought
their way to power in Salvador, one becoming Presi
dent and the other Vice President. The processes by which
they reached power, though abnormal elsewhere, were nor
mal there, since a constitutional change in the Presidency
had been unknown for fifty years, and one robber and mur
derer had succeeded another as President by revolution. In
due time Gutierrez, by revolution, expelled the Ezetas.
and one of them, with his staff of ragamuffin generals, fook
refuge on a United States ship and landed in San Francisco,
where they were detained upon Salvador's demand that they
be extradited for punishment.
TKe case was heard by Hon. \V. W. Morrow, then
United States District Judge, and it was clearly shown that
the crimes imputed to Ezeta were customary acts in that
country, incident to the many usurpations of the Presiden
tial power, and while the Ezetas had probably been 'a trifle
handier with gun and dagger than their bloodthirsty prede
cessors and successors, their offenses were still the ordinary
incidents in the politics of Salvador, and extradition was
refused. Had the party been extradited of course they would
have been tied together and shot as soon as they landed in
Salvador. This case was not on all fours with that of
Lynchehaun. His offense, whatever it was, seems to have
been a felony under the laws of Great Britain. Had he been
extradited he .would not have been delivered over*to sum
mary punishment without trial, but would have his day
in court and the benefit of all the orderly machinery of jus
tice to prove his innocence or mitigate his punishment. It
is a misrepresentation of American sentiment to say that his
crime, though brutal, was political, and that therefore he is
entitled to an inviolable asylum in the United States. We
don't want any additions to that class of people in this
country. When the next anarchist murders a President of
the United States, if he succeed in making a^foreign asylum,
his extradition may be refused to us on exactly the same
grounds as those put for the benefit of Lyncheha,un by the
Indianapolis Commissioner.

the fingers all remain relaxed and that
the hand is not thrown out -of poise.
There must be absolutely no movement

after each time remember to relax with
one or two revolutions of the "circle" mo

to count aloud, very slowly, then go on

"FINGER MOTION."
/
FROM East and West come almost daily accounts of
riotous, unlawful and disorderly conduct by students
in colleges, universities and high schools. Often serious
j personal injury is inflicted and property is maliciously de
j stroyed. In one town even the young lady students engaged
in a free for all fight on the stage in a public hall, and bit
and bruised and scratched each other" and tore off clothes
to the extreme of indecency. These things are too much
excused on the score of class spirit and youthful efferves
cence of feeling. They show bad training in the spirit of
! respect for the rights of others, and in the inviolability of
j property. A felony committed upon person or property is
no less a felony because they who commit it are students
and are young and bumptious. Even in old and sober in
stitutions like Yale and Harvard there are violent out
1 breaks which lead to criminal excesses.
It is^ not always that the persons injured and property
damaged or destroyed belong to the institutions whose stu
dents are responsible. The citizens who live in the vicinity
of universities and colleges, instead. of finding the contact
elevating to their children, are mortified to know that the
spirit of recklessness and disorder is by example taught to
their own households, and there is a general loosening of
the bonds of order and obedience. Even homicides are com
mitted in these mad outbreaks, or wounds are inflicted that
are a lifelong handicap upon the sufferer.
There is need of drawing closer the lines of parental ad
monition and control, and of stricter attention to discipline
on the part of the officers of institutions of learning. No
sane person objects to the young' folks having "a good
time," but it is not having a good time to brawl like drunken
costermongers, or destroy property like criminal incen
diaries. There is everything in the, good old-fashioned char
acter of lady and gentleman. It is a character founded upon
lifelong restraint of reckless impulse, and in a refined re
spect for the rights of others. But these wholesome stan
dards seem to be lost sight of. It is too frequently the
case that people who have to be on the streets, or in public
conveyances, near institutions of learning are offended by
disorderly conduct and vile language by students. The per
sonal philosophy of life and character and conduct are re
vealed not by young people in moments of self-conscious
ness, when they wish to be favorably impressed upon those
who observe them, but by their self-restraint and demeanor
when in charge of their own discipline.
It is, painful to reflect thai when the standard is applied
so many fail in measurement to the proportion of gentlemen.
It is to be hoped that from the family outward to the col
lege faculty there may be made and enforced a strong im
pression of the need of inculcating unselfishness and re
spect for others and for propriety of conduct. A student
body so trained should be incapable of resolving itself into
a destructive mob, capable of thoughtless and violent con
duct. The example is of evil, and only evil; It.strengthens the
bad purpose of the criminal and abandoned, who, seeing the
toleration of lawlessness in students, conclude naturally that
their kind of criminal disregard for the law is just as war
rantable. Every American should desire to see our students
all capable of self-control as a great preparation for the time
soon coming when, as citizens, they 1 will control the Gov
ernment itself, and take its direction for good or for evil.

It i* a delight to watch Paderewski's
grasp of this exercise and to hear the
wonderful effects he produces with It.
Any fine pianist Is worth taking your
child to hear and see. however, provided
you let him sit near enough so that noth
ing will escape him.
It is very poor economy to take children
to any sort of entertainment and buy
peats in the- rear of the house. It Is a
great strain on the eyes, they miss much
that they should see and their Interest Is
apt to wane before the performance is
half over. It Is much better to go to a
few concerts or recitals and sit in close
proximity to the performer than to go to
many and sit so far back that the child
derives little or no benefit from them.
This "down-arm" exercise Is very im
portant, for it la always used (In a mod
ified form, of course) in bringing out rich
tones in piano playing, where heavy
chords occur. It prevents any .flat,
"bangy" effects, and makes instead a vol
ume of sound combined with a richness
in tone not to be accomplished In any
other way.
As thÂ« Tcrist rises the hand and elbow
hang loosely downward, and do not alter
their relative positions in the exercise
until the middle finger has touched the
table again, after which Cnot before) the
wrist drops and rises, describing the circle
several times, or until you are satisfied
that the muscle* are perfectly free.
After having limbered up the child's
muscles for a moment by means of the
first motion, let him raise the right arm
without your aid to about the height of
his head, exactly as you did it for him
in the first exercise; but in coming down
there is a difference. Instead of letting
the arm dron as it will if must drop
straight down, in a perfectly relaxed and
free condition, but with the hand keeping
the exact position it assumed naturally
on its Journey upward â consequently as
it comes down the tip of the middle fin
ger will hit the table first. Using this
finger as a pivot, try the circle exercise
that is, describe a circle with the wrist,
according to the explanation in the first
lesson. This will relax the muscles, in
case there Is a tendency to tighten them
in the raising and lowering of the arm.
II will simplify this exercise greatly if
you tell the child to imagine there is a
string hanging from the ceiling, the end
of which is tied to his wrist, and which
draws the wrist up toward the ceiling,
holds it there a moment and then lets
it gently drop down again. That will help
him to put his thought directly on his
wrist, will make him relax all the other
muscles and at the same time relax his
wrist, even while it is going up, for the
Imaginary string will have quite as much
power to help him as your hand had In
the first exercise, only in this case he will
be doir.g all the work without realizing It.
Be sure that his wrist is leading, in
stead of either elbow or shoulder. If you
do not watch him every instant. If you
do not continue calling his attention to
"the string," his mind may wander, and
unconsciously his arm will be raised by
elbow or shoulder, which will throw It
out of poise, and so do harm instead of
rood.

ercises. The next exercise is to be a com
bination pf two of the others and is called
the "<5own-arm" movement.
Do not fall to follow all these direc
tions carefully, for the next lesson will
take our little pupil to the piano Itself.
In raising the fingers always raise
them from the second joint, thus keep
ing them arched exactly as they are when
at rest, in "playing position." The best
way to acconfpllsh this is to bring the
imaginary string into use again. Pretend
that-it Is tied around the second Joint of
the finger, and that it raises and lowers
the fingers, exactly as it did the wrist.
If you do not use this little subterfuge
the boy's tendency will be to throw the
end of the finger forward and out as it
rises,, thereby Inducing a complex mus
cular action which we wish to avoid.
After all the fingers have received their
proper amount of exercise It is quite pbs
sible that in spite of your efforts with
the relaxing motion there may be some
tension, caused by all this added work.
Therefore it is a good plan to go back
to first principles occasionally during the
lesson and, raising the pupli s arm for
him, let It drop at will, repeating the ex
ercise until all Is as it should be again.
Above all, never stop the lesson while the
child's arm is tense. Be sure he is per
fectly relaxed before you cease operations
for the day.

much of It at first, however. It will grad
ually come under better control.
Many people have had the muscles con

hoping thereby to gain great indepen

periment, and In almost every case has

"WRIST MOTION."
A Matter of Names.
An Alameda man has just completed the
construction of a small sailboat for his
13-year-old boy. The boat was launched,
proved a success and only lacked a name
to take her place in befitting style among
the pleasure craft of the bay city.
"Let me choose a name for her." said
Tax Collector Ed Smith, who is a friend
of the amateur boat builder, "and I will
furnish a set of flags."
"I have honored your boat by calling
her Muriel, after my daughter," said
Smith a few weeks later. "Here are the
Hags. I hope you will like them."
The name was duly accepted and the
following morning at breakfast the Ala
meda man displayed the flags and la
formed his* family that the yacht would
be called Muriel, after Mr. Smith's daugh
ter. The selection was received with
warm approval by all but the youth for
whose recreation the boat had been built.
"What's the matter, George?" said his
father. "Don't you like the name?"
"Yes, the name's all right and It's easy
enough for you and very nice for Mr.
Smith, but I'll have to lick about seven
boys before I can convince the gang that
the boat is named after Muriel Smith and
not the Muriel that lives up the street."
Calif arnia Feathers.
"To find out anything about the os
trich feather trade in New York." says
the New York Times, "it is necessary tÂ°
Ii3ten to diametric statements of whole
sale dealers. Broadway below Fourteenth
street is th* ostrich feather mart of tho #
United States. Feather manufacturers
there had spent years in building up a
big trade long before ostrich raising was
thought of in Southern California.
"These merchants, as a rule, have not
given a hospitable welcome to the Amer
ican bird. They insist that the contribu
tion of ostrich feathers from California
ranches are a mere bagatelle in the trade
and that if it were not for the duty of 13
per cent Imposed on South African feath
ers In the rough the Pacific Coast os
triches would cut no figure at all.
"On the other hand, manufacturers who
have abandoned Imported ostrich feath
ers to devote themselves entirely to the
California product and have moved near
er to the retail stores uptown, where
women may see yieir wares displayed in
big show windows, declare that the do
mestic ostrich feathers are gaining every
year on the imported article and they are
going to try to induce Congress to raise
the duty on raw feathers to 50 per cent,
the same as it is for imported dyed and
manufactured feathers.
"In retail trade the milliners treat rival
feather dealers impartially. The differ
ence between the California and South
African ostrich feathers is quite as
marked as the difference between Cali
fornia and Burgundy claret, and the dif
ference in price is in about the same ra
tio. Customers may choose for them
selves."

In this lospon we will take up a new
exercise, quite as important in its turn
?s those already explained. Before at
tempting it. however, be certain that the
child is able to relax perfectly in the ex
erdsea he already has.
The matter of the time expended in
[emrnlas the secret of relaxation (in other
words, releasing the muscles frum arti
ficial tension) is, at the longest, only a
question of a few days, more or less_ but
1 cannot tco carefully impress upon you
the necessity of be!ng absolutely sure that
the child understands what is required of
him before we go on to the next st< j p.
Remember that he cannot fail to acquire
the idea, if you are patient with him,
and that if you hurry him too much the
whole thir.s will become a hopeless jum
ble in his mind. Mak<- him feel that you
are helping him, not pushing him.
Above all, if it doen not sivm to come
easy to him. do not let him become dis
rouraged or let him imagine that you are
fllseouraged. Children, as a rule, have a
sublime faith in th^ir flders' infallibility,
and if you assure the pupil that you
know he will* conquer in a short time
half the battle wili be won. even then.
This may sound absurd to you. but I have
arought so many little children through
'Ms phase of piano study successfully
:hat I know how much this sort of men
tal ru-lp means to them. Even the best
Â¦5f us like encouragement. Be sure, how
tver, that you give it in a way that is
Â»n incentive to the child to do better work
all the time and let him understand that
thpre is still much ahead of him.
In our first lesson I give you three ex-
mations alleged to resembel human faces.
etc., require a stretch of the imagination
to fill in the detail. Six miles cast of
Kenton, however, is a Dakota sandstone
chipped and chiseled by the elements till
its likeness Is silhouette to the head of a
woman is perfect. Every feature, chin,
mouth, nose and brow, Is cut against the
sky in clearest outline. The head rounds
gracefully to the neck, which offers a
slender support to the mass of rock above
it. The face is that of an aristocratic
colonial dame.â New York Tribune.
WITHOUT entering now upon an analysis of the vote cast for Mayor, in general terms it
may be said to mean that, after selecting their ticket by the largest vote thrown at a pri
mary by any party in years the Republicans of San. Francisco shied and flinched and con
cluded to evade undertaking the responsibility of the city's administration. This is the
fact, and we do not pretend to account for it. The Republicans of this city have done the same thing
before and will probably do it again, until some overmastering necessity jars them out of the habit.
They chose to vote for Budd against Estee, and thereby defeated ,a man whose honesty of purpose, abil
ity and service were not questioned. When the party skies were dark he upheld the banner in his equal
contest with Hon. Stephen M. White, the ablest leader and the best the Democracy ever had
in the State.
His party rewarded him with the Senatorship, and Kstee's reward, when the time came to confer
it, was defeat by his own party. No one^ran account for this occasional outbreak of fondness for the
holy rollers in politics. It is an idiosyncrasy which reflection and experience only can cure. In their
principles and theories of politics Lane and Schmitz were twins. They are the Eng and Chang of San
Francisco politics. Under such- circumstances they divided the holy roller vote of the city and offered
to united Republicanism ah opportunity which it has rejected by refusing to unite. The Republican
ticket was exceptionally worthy, and its head was a business man of the best standing, young, energetic j
and public-spirited. ,
The members of his party who have seen the banner that he carried with courage and with clean
hands go down to defeat may now have leisure to ask themselves whether in the future any man as
good will be found willing to respond to a call to leadership. An army that shoots its own generals
finally comes to a point where there are no generals, and has to use its guns on members of the staff,
and, at last, in a massacre of the privates. We take the result with philosophy. A watchful and inde
pendent press can prevent many of the abuses of adnr'nistration by their timely exposure, and in a cer
tain high sense the press holds a commission to protect the people, even against the consequences of
their own folly or indifference. In that spirit and with that purpose we shall stand sentry in the pjace
in which the people have refused to stand guard.
The San Francisco of to-day is not the work of one man, but the structure wrought upon and
formed and fashioned by many. So will be this city of the future. One administration did not make
it, nor can one unmake it. We were persuaded that an administration under Mr. Crocker would clothe
it with dignity and grandeur greater than it had known. But no one man or Mayor can divest it. No
one class of its citizens can gather to themselves a monopoly of its gifts and graces and benefits. In
different at the polls, and prone to tie upon the city's feet clogs that impair progress and slacken her
advance, the people, after all. when they find each day's march growing shorter and the advance hin
dered by their own acts, put their shoulders under the burden of their own unwisdom and lift it. If
they choose to make this work more difficult it is their choice and they pay the penalty.
Out of the confusion of sounds and signs that are now upon us one thing is clear. San Fran
cisco, in her preference in national politics, is a Republican city. Inattentive to the local spur that
might speed her progress and make easier her advance, she is unerring in her judgment in greater things
and makes no mistake in tracing her fortunes to their origin in the national policies of the party whose
right to rule in municipal affairs she disputes with success. Erratic in lesser things, she is sound in her
judgment in greater things, and next year will make good report of her purpose in national politics.
"Quartz" Billings Again.
"Quartz" Billings grew reminiscent
again while he was sitting in the Cold
Day ohophouse down on Leidesdorff street
the other night. Between gulps of coffee
he began to discuss his favorite topicâ
the sublimity of Nevada justice as It was
dispensed ten years ago.
"One night." said "Quartz," "when
everything from the faro banks to the
real estate was running sorter loose In
Nevada half of Slide Mountain forsook
the rest and came tearing down into the
valley back of Washoe City. Nobody
would a-cared a bit about that, except
that it was going at seen a rate that when
it hit the valley it picked up Joe Frey's
ranch and boosted It over on top of Tule
Frank's ranch and then settled down in
the hole Joe Frey's ranch used to occupy.
"The perplexing question of law this
cussedness on the part of Slide Mountain
brought up was, "Who owned the ranch
that landed on top? Joe Frey claimed
the ranch because his was on top, and
he said every man owned his property
under the law clear up to the blue heaven.
Tule Frank said the ranch was his'n be
cause every man owned his property to
the middle of the earth. So the litigation
began.
"They got a jury together in back of
the old Dostoffice at Washoe before the
County Jedge. and some young fellers
from the States turned loose more law in
the six day.H of the trial than the Jedge's
cranium could take in in seventeen years.
"Then the jury went out to decide who
nature intended to own these ranches.
It hung out four days. But. flnaJly,
when the jury reached a jedgment we
all filed in to hear the doom of the de
feated litigunt and git drunk with the
winner. Well, that jury found that
Tiile Frank was the owner of that ranch,
but stuck In the proviso to the effeck
that before Tulc Frank could u?ie the
ranch he'd have to throw Joe Frey's
ranch ofn It."

as the circular motion ceases and the

the wrist nor to lower it, and to keep it

The fingers must not aid In the raising

"three" the back of the hand must be
turned as far toward the wrist as it con

Frank P. Sargent, Commissioner Gen

a report to Secretary Cortelyou of the
Department of Commerce and Labor, ad
vocating the erection of an Immigrant de
tention building, where Chinese and other
aliens may be confined pending examina
tion as to their right to be landed. While
on a visit to this port recently hÂ» was
favorably impressed with -Angel Island,
or that part of it adjacent to thÂ© quar
antine grounds, as a site for an immi
grant station. In his letter to Secretary
Ccrtelyou Commissioner Sargent says:
"At the port of San Francisco a build
ing should be erected for the accommoda
tion of aliens pending a decision as to
their right to enter the United States.
Such a structure is of special importance,
as San Francisco is the chief port of en
try for Chinese and because, moreover,
though it enter chefly Oriental peoples
who are the principal mediums for the
introduction of dangerous communicable
diseases. I recommend accordingly an
appropriation of S200.0CO for the erection
at said port, preferably on Government
land in the harbor separate from tha
mainland, of buildings for the accommo
dation of aliens for their safe detention
until shown to be entitled to land and to
prevent communication with them by per
sons who find their interest In landing
aliens unlawfully.

The reception was held In the parlors

choicest flowers and festooned in green.
A myriad of lights produced a brilliant
effect and broueht into prominence the
pretty costumes of the young ladies and
the' sparkling jewels of those who were

loners of the church were present and
seemed, to enjoy renewing past associa

The reception tendered the new rector
of old St. John's Church, Oakland, last
evening: was In every way a brilliant af
fair. The impression made by Rev. Mr.
Gee on Sunday was so favorable as to in
crease the desire of all the members of
the church to meet him in a less Informal
manner than was practicable on the first
day of his ministrations.
Chairman Dick also received a cable
gram practically Identical in nature with
thote received by the Delegate. Kalan

one he received and notified his native

Insures the continuance of Senator Han

While the returns from Maryland are
very meager, the indications are that
the State has been carried by the Dem
ocrats. The contest in that State has had
national significance In several ways. In
the first place, Senator Arthur P. Gor
man, who is the Democratic leader in
Congress, led the fight for the Democrats.
His candidacy for the Democratic nomi
nation for President next year was at
stake. President Roosevelt took great
interest in the fight and was denounced
by Senator German from the stump for
Federal interference. The color question
was introduced into the fight. The re
election of Senator McComas is at stake,
as his term is about to expire and he
will have to appeal for re-election to the
Legislature chosen yesterday.
Massachusetts has re-elected Bates Gov

The Eleventh District, composed of re
mote mountain counties, last year gave
19.000 Republican majority and probably
will duplicate It this year. Returns from
that district will not be complete before
Thursday night. Beckham's majority out
side the Eleventh District is estimated at
85,000. None of the counties in the dis
trict has been heard from.
The day In Louisville was an exciting
one and the election was bitterly fought.
The Republican managers claim they
have proof that in thirty-two precincts
in this city the polling places In Repub
lican precincts were either kept closed
all or part of the time or removed to ob
scure places. They also charge ballot
box stuffing, the forcible ejection of Re
publican officers and the intimidation of
negro voters by the policemen and fire
men of the present Democratic city ad
ministration. These conditions led to
many fights.
Of the 119 counties in the State returns
have been received from thirty-eight.
These give Beckham 54,054 and Belknap
56,770. More than forty of the remain
ing counties are remote,^ some of them
being nearly two days' Journey from tel
ephone or telegraph wires.
Louisville and Jefferson County gave
Beckham B200 majority over Belknap, in
round numbers. Terkes (Rep.) carried
Louisville and Jefferson County in the
last gubernatorial election by 51D0. This
gain of 10,000 votes, added to Beckham's
majority of 3500 at the last election, in
sures him a majority of 13,500, if ail the
ether counties in the State duplicate their
vote at the last gubernatorial election.
Beckham, however, has made a total gain
of nearly 2000 in his total from the twen
ty-odd counties heard from.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. f Nov. 8.â With the
close of an election characterized by an
unusually heavy vote, numerous disorders
and evidences of many gross irregulari
ties, the re-election of Governor Beckham
(Dem.) over Colonel Morris B. Belknap
(Rep.) by a majority of fully 15,000 seems
assured. The Republicans concede the
election of Governor Beckham.
DEMOCRATIC VICTORY
IN TrRTJTUCKV HARKED
BY ELECTION FRAUDS
The Legislature remains practically un
changed, so far as the Democrats and
Republicans are concerned, but the So
cialistic party, which had three members
last year, will be represented by only one,
a member from Brockton. The Social
istic vote fell off considerably from last
year and the failure to re-elect Repre
sentative Carey of Haverhill, one of the
party leaders and a member of the lower
branch of the Legislature for five years,
Â¦was one of the features of the election.
With returns complete from every town
and city In the Stata the total vote for
Governor was: Bates (R.) 193,393, Gaston
CD.) 1C3.544.
The weather was fine and the vote re
markably large for an off year. The
early returns ehowed that Governor
Bates had made slight gains in the Email
towns and cities, but this was overcome
by the Democrats, who polled a big vote
In Boston for Gaston. The hard work of
the party managers in this city esulted
in increasing Gaston's plurality of 13,000
last year to nearly 20,000 this year.
In addition to electing their State ticket
and holding 1 the Legislature, the Repub
licans also were successful in retaining
control of the Governor's council, which
will be composed of five Republicans and
one Democrat-
cratic candidate. "With a dozen
cities inA towns to hear from Bates had
a lead of 32,325. but as the missing towns
are all etrongly Republican there was
every Indication at a late hour to-night
that the plurality of thÂ» Republican can
didate would be practically the -same eÂ»
that cf last year, although the total vote
may run higher.

The returns from the counties are meager,
but it 13 not believed that the Republican

As far as known here at this hour the

AT THE PRESIDIO
SE\TTLE. Nov. 3. â The new steamship
Oregon arrived in port at 11:30 o'clock this
morning with the news that the disabled
freighter Meteor had been towed into Dutch
Harbor by the Eureka on October 2Â«, sixteen
days after she had been picked up with her
rudder and Â«crew gone.
About six years ago Roadwarmer was
a very conspicuous and popular horse
here. He was In the stable of William

old Bay District and the Ingleside tracks.
"Will Compile Greyhound Studbook.
A meeting of the American Coursing
Board was held yesterday at Oklahoma
City. Okla.. and Peer Tiffany, secretary
of the California Coursing Committee,
was elected keeper of the American Grey
hound studbook. He will compile this
year's volume, as well as the one for next
year.
EUREKA, Nov. 8.â Four lads, the
youngest 17 years old, stole from her
moorings in this port last night the tug
Peerless and put to sea. "When the loss
was discovered this morning by the
Barker McLean Launch Company, the
tug Ranger was sent In pursuit, the latter
vessel sighting the missing craft to the
northward of Eureka.
Before the Ranger cjuld get to the
Peerless the latter was on flre. but her
engines were still going ahead. The
Ranger ran alongside the Peerless and
took off tho four boys. They are Owen
Sawyer, aged 20, of Kaisas City; R.
LaJine, aged 18; Herman Briggs, 17, and
William Reap, 17. The l'.st three claim
Ukiah as their home.
The vessel was taken in j tow and
brought inside the bar, burning fiercely,
and wa3 beached at the life saving sta
tion, where the flames were extinguished,
leaving only her hull.
The boys claim that they took the ves
sel at 11:30 o'clock last night and were
bound to Crescent City. Not understand
ing the manipulation of the boiler, they
fired up so heavily that the water was
used up in the boiler, the heat setting
flre to the vessel.
The Peerless was valued at $4000 and
was insured for $1000. Three of the lads
who ran away with her were in jail yes
terday morning charged with vagrancy
and were released on a promise to leave
town. The four are now in the county
Jail, charged with grand larceny.
Vernon was riding: Roadwarmer and
when they were about half way up the
SanHedrln, near the twin bridges, a
young black bear was espied near the
road. Vernon, who had a small caliber
pistol, took a shot at the animal. The
bullet, of course, only wounded bruin and
he charged his assailants.
Vernon was depending on the speed of
tho racer for safety, but for the first time
Roadwarmer refused to start. The bear
kept coming- and Vernon thought his time
had come and was about to make his
escape on foot, the other horses having
stampeded.
When the bear was in reach the horse
squared around and a battle royal com
menced, the horse using his hoofs to good
advantage. When Vernon managed to get
the horse away the bear was lying in an
unrecognizable mass and the horse was
uninjured. The bear weighed 125 pounds.
UKIAH, Nov. 3.â Roadwarmer, a well
known race horse in this section, killed

Rubber Ankles was the sensation of the
San Francisco â¢ Kennel Club show last

hound in the show, which, attracted a
world's record entry of 114 in this class.
Sl]e' Is fawn in color and Is built on dainty
and beautiful lines, having a most aris

Mr. Rosseter, â¢ who nominated Rubber
Ankles, haa been for many years the
most representative coursing man in all
America, Since the Waterloo was Insti

the stake last year with Roman Ath
lete, aison of Emln.Pasha; The' latter
was . his representative in- the first cup
meeting and divided the stake with May
Queen in 1900. In coursing, when a stake
Is divided it is recorded as a victory for
each of the two dogs reaching, the decid
ing course. In 1901 at St. Louis, Mr. Ros
seter was second with Rocker. A valu
able cup is offered this year for the first
time.
Rubber Ankles was bred by J. H. Ros

the most beautiful greyhound of her
time in . California. In this: litter were

RECOVERING FROM
SEVERE ILLNESS
The thi2ves entered the house by means
of a side window, which was found open.
They were satisfied with the loot they
secured in the first room that was entered
and took no chances of spreading a gen
eral alarm by proceeding to others.
The Police Department was at once no
tified and detectives were put on the case.
The sleuths are of the opinion that the
men who did the work are the same who
have been operating for several . days.
They have also received some information
to the effect that the work is being done
by clever crooks from' the East, who are
keeping their identity a secret.
The mysterious porch climbers, who
have been operating with so much suc
cess in the fashionable portion of the
city during the last few days, made an
other haul last night when they entered
the home of Attorney Jesse Lilienthal,
1S01 Gough street, and succeeded in get
ting away with $7S in cash and $100 worth
of jewelry. As usual, the shrewd crooks
left no clew by which the detectives
might trail them.
The Lilienthal family was at dinner
when the men did their work and the
loss was not discovered until a member
of the family went upstairs shortly after
7 o'clock. The room entered was in a
state of confusion and things â¢ were
thrown ail over' the floor, drawers were
taken out and their contents scattered
about. From indications the thieves did
their work in a hurry.
The Waterloo plate was won by Celtic,
owned by J. Charlton & Sons of Minne
apolis. The runher-up was Consort, nom
inated by J. H. Roeseter of San Fran
cisco. The winner in this received >$A

be the Waterloo Derby, which will be run
to-morrow. ' / . , _ .
American Waterloo cup to-day.
Yours Truly,, owned by Wilson & Allen
of Victor. Iowa, being the runner-up. The
stake was worth $600 to the winner in ad
dition to the cup, while $300 went to the
runner-up. Rubber Ankles scored a-de
cisive victory, running up a total of
points to her opponent's 8. The trial last
ed one minute and sixteen seconds, suf
ficient time in which -to try the speed and
the gameness of any greyhound.
What would otherwise have been the
must successful day of the Waterloo
meeting had a pathetic ending In the
death on the field of Countess Eve, owned
by D. K. Carter of Cottonwood Falls,
Kans. She was valued at $500. The day s
events began with the third round of the
Waterloo purse, the winner of which re
ceived $200 and the runner-up $100. There
were sixteen entries originally In this
event, which had been run down to the
deciding course. The 'contest was then
between Countess Eve and Northern Ex
press, the latter owned by Blake, ft^mlth
of Butte, Mont. This came as the last
course of the day, the other events hav
ing been completed.
The last race of her life was the fourth
one Countess Eve ran during the after
noon, all of them being for the full limit
of time. In the last, however, she show
ed remarkable endurance and not until
she had brought victory to her owner did
she fall. She had run herself to death.
The full time elapsed before the relief
dog was liberated and that animal had
just overtaken the main contestants and
almost simultaneously all three dogs
caught the hare.' Countess Eve was seen
> to make one frantic effort and fall to the
ground. The trainers were the first to
t reach Countess Eve, but it was too late
to give any assistance. She probably
died the minute she struck the ground,
but she had won the purse. Northern
Express received second money.

At last accounts the Ascot Park people

were rather hiph ;ind then again he is said
to hiivo stipulated ' that he would act in
r.o capacity on a track where hurdle or
steeplechase horses received any consid

habitants of the southern metropolis will
find this jumping horse serm a more seri

bacilli, and Judge Mcrse is to be congrat
ulated on his stand.
The syndicators at Los Angeles spent
n profitable nineteen days' sspell of rac

Vosburgh has been official handicapper
for the beard of control of the Jockey
Club during the last fourteen years. The
outcome of the dispute is awaited with
considerable interest by horsemen.
Bell, who formerly owned the speedy
Hermis. which he sold to E. R. Thomas
for $60,000. caused considerable excitement
about the clubhouse by h'.s verbal attack
on Vosburgn. He declares that he has
ample grounds for complaint and points
to cases where his horses have been, he
says, weighted out of any chance to win.
He maintains that so important an ad
junct to racing shou-ld be in the hands
of a board, as in England, and not of one
man.
NEW YORK. Nov. 3.â As the result of
a charge made by Louis V. Bell, a well
known turf man, that his horses had been
unfairly handicapped for a lone period,
for which he could obtain no redress,
Walter S. Vosburgh, official handicapper
for the Jockey Club, who is also a stew
ard at the Aqueduct meetins now being
held, declares he will lay the subject be
fore the Jockey Club.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Taade in Fruits was steady during the early
mornlr.g hour*, but a holiday feeling prevailed
during the greater part of the day, owing to
the municipal election, and several houses were
closed a few hours in advance of the regular
tirr.e. Receipts of most descriptions were more
than sufficient for requirements and as usual
there waf quite a surplus of tree Fruits on
hand at the close. Figs were the firmest de
scription and as receipts were light prices
ranged higher. Table Grapes In crates were
easier, owing to the lack of demand for ship
ping. Small boxes were in light receipt and
steady. Receipts of large boxes were rather
light and cleaned up readily, with fancy Muscat
only bringing tho top quotation. Receipts of
Strawberries and Raspberries were more lib
eral than on the preceding day and prices
ranged lower. The demand, however, was fair
at the revised quotations and the market
cleaned uj> well.
Despite the cool, cloudy weather there was a
better demand for Valencia Oranges for local use
and there v.-as some inquiry for shipment to
nearby points. Prices of fancy Etock were
firmer and sales of repacked were reported at
$4 per box. The other Citrus Fruits were quiet

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Strictly fancy table Potatoes were In fair
request for local use, but thfl market was
overstocked and had an easy tone. The recent
arrivals of Oregon Potatoes were mostly of
poor quality and prices ranged lower. The
trade was HberaJly supplied with Sweet Po
tatoes, and a carload that came In from Mer
ced was offered at a decline. Onions continued
steady for fancy ctock, while common otter
ings met with a very light demand. Choice
Lima Beans were in limited supply and firm,
bat all other vegetables were abundant, .and
the market generally had a weak tone. Stocks
of Tomatoes were still too heavy for the mar
ket to absorb, and tales at the top quotation
were rare The canners were not In the mar
ket.

Lytton Eepairs Completed.
The British steamship Lytton left the Rlsdon
Iron Works yesterday and anchored In the
stream. When she arrived here some weeks
ago she was In very bad shape, as the result
of having been ashore on the Central American
coast She was for seven days on Hunters
Point dry dock and has been thoroughly over
hauled. The Itifdtm people made a quick Job
of the repairs, which were completed to the
full satisfaction of the London Salvage Associ

A HEAVY earthquake on the Jap
anese coast shook up the whaling
bark California last August with
such a jar that the chief officer's
watch stopped and all hands re
ceived a large sized scare. The shaking
continued for nearly forty seconds and
by the time things settled down all hands
were on deck, wondering whether or not
the bark had suddenly become v mixed up
In a free-for-all race in which the compet
itors were adult whales of fuil growth.
The California came into port late yes
terday afternoon, but reached quarantine
in time to pass the doctor. She had a suc
cessful trip and in the grand division of
the spoils all hands will receive some
thing. "Some of the men," said Captain
Josephs, "will get as much as $20."
The California loft here November 20,
going first to the Marquesas \ Islands, in
the vicinity of wfiich she weathered the
terrific hurricane which on January 13
swept those south- sea islands with such
disastrous effect. The bark Alice Knowles,
which arrived last night too late for
quarantine Inspection, was in the same
storm.
From Marquesas the California went to
Guam, where several days were spent.
She was at Hakodate and hunted the
waters along the Siberian coast. She lost
seven whales and during the voyage had
boats stove In five times. No lives were
lost and the men who were In the boats
speak lightly of being flipped Into the
air by the fore of a blow from a whale's
tail and soused Into the sea alongside the
splashing mammal.
1 The California's catch is valued at
about $20,000 and includes 1025 barrels of
sperm oil, 135 barrels of whale oil and
1223 pounds of bone.

ers to recover 5347 alleged to be due htm

paying him for his services as guide to
the mythical treasure buried under the

caneers, whose bones have been polished
by the fishes long ago. The schooner was
sold at Tahiti by the American Consul,
and Brown was degraded to the position

In discussing her subject, "The Future's
Claims," Miss Laughlin urged the neces
sity of claiming the ballot for women,
not so much for what it would give them
now as to be able to claim from the Leg
islature certain rights for women of the
future. The speaker referred with prido
to the Massachusetts women, who in
their appearance before the Legislature
have secured for the wife equal rights
In guardianship over their children. An
informal reception followed the lecture,
during which the speaker was tendered
the most enthusiastic support.
Miss Lauehlin, who is at present on
the coast for the purpose of organizing
the State for the next suffrage campaign,
is a graduate of Wellesley and of Cornell
University Law School. While at Welles
ley she founded the Agoro Society, now
the largest of the collece. At Cornell
she was elected president of the Dra
matic Club and speaker of Cornell Con
gress. In 1897, being chosen to represent
the congress in interclub debates, she won
the championship for it. In 1898, in a
series of interclub debates, open to all
the 2000 students, the greater number be
ing men, the prize was awarded Miss
"Laughlin. As a result of these victories
she was elected leader of the Cornell
team to debate with the University of
Pennsylvania and her eloquence gained
the victory for Cornell.
Soon after graduation Miss Laughlin
delivered such a strong address upon
'â¢Women Wage Earners" before the Na
tional. Suffrage Convention that she re
ceived an offer to become expert agent
of the United States Industrial Commis
sion to investigate the conditions of do

has heard much testimony on both sides
Kince his aid was called into service and
has made a thorough investigation of
the conditions that exist in the street

The terms of his decision have not yet
been announced beyond the fact that he
found in favor of an increase in the
wages of the employes, while he refused
to recommend any change in or shorten

It was learned on reliable authority that
the men have been granted an Increase of
2 cents an hour. They will receive 27 cents
an hour. They asked for an increase of

JUDGE ESTEE'S
BODY IS HERE
G. Moees Cobb, who for years had been
one of the most eminent lawyers and
men of affairs in San Francisco, passed
peacefully away at the Lane Hospital at
an early hour yesterday morning. The
direct cause of his death was typhoid
fever, though he had been a sufferer from
a complication of ailments for a long
time.
Cobb was born at Princeton, Worcester
County, Mass., on November 24, 1S20. He
was a descendant of a famous family
that had emigrated to Massachusetts
with the Puritans. He received his earlier
education at Groton Academy, and, after
graduating with honors there, went to
Harvard, where he began the study of
law.
After completing his course at Harvard,
Cobb began the practice" of his profes
sion in Middlesex and Sheffield counties,
Massachusetts. He practiced with much
success and was deemed one of the
brightest young lawyers in those parts.
At the outbreak of the Civil War young
Cobb was seized with the fighting spirit,
and, abandoning his chosen profession,
entered the ranks of the United States
Volunteers and fought in many of the
bloody battles of that bitter engagement
for two years. Then he resolved to seek
r.ew fields, and arrived in San Francisco
at the close of the war.
Cobb had resided in this city ever since.
He began the practice v of law as soon as
he came here, and up to the time of his
death he was looked upon as one of the
best authorities on legal questions. He
was always known as an honest, ener
getic citizen and was honored by all the
early settlers in this city.
Cobb was a prominent member of the
Knights Templar, Masons and Odd Fei
lows and always took an active part in
the affairs of the three organizations. He
is survived by a wife, Mrs. Sophia Cobb.
at present in Boston; a son. Harry Cobb,
and five grandchildren, one of whom,
Francis Harold Cobb, is a resident of this
city.
During the day Feld was visited by his
mother, brother and a number of rela
tives. The only time he showed any emo
tion was when ho saw his mother. Tears
filled his eyes and for a moment he could
not speak. Although he had been five
years on the force, he is not yet 27 "years
of age. Attorney Choynski, who repre
sented him in the divorce suit brought
by his wife, also visited him.
Feld positively 'declined yesterday to
make any statement for publication. It Is
thought that his plea will be self-defense,
from the fact that, Dirking's son slipped
a bread knife into his father's hand when
Mrs. Dirking and Mrs. Feld were being
beaten at the front door by Feld. Ac
cording to Dirking's ante-mortem state
ment, immediately after the knife had
been passed to him, Feld stepped back
three paces and took deliberate aim at
him, firing the fatal Bhot. As an evi
dence of the close range at which the
shot was fired it was discovered yester
day that the bullet had passed through a
book containing about a dozen of Dirk
ing's business cards. It is also thought
that the plea may be temporary insan
ity.
When Chief Wittman reached his office
yesterday morning he at once, In ac
cordance with a provision in the charter,
served a written notice upon Feld sus
pending him, and his star was taken from
him.
Fritz Dlrklne, who was shot by his eon*
in-law. Policeman Joseph Feld, at his
residence, 11 Fair avenue, on Monday
rJght, died at St. Luke's Hospital yester
day morning, shortly after 6 o'clock, and
the body was removed to the Morgue.
Feld, who had been booked on a charge
of assault to murder, was immediately
booked on a charge of murder.
Feld did not display any emotion when
told that his father-in-law was dead.
After being booked, he asked Desk Ser
geant Melody to be allowed to walk
around the prison and not be locked up,
but Melody said he could not extend, any
such privilege without the consent of
his superiors. Feld made the same re
quest of Sergeant Bidwell, who has
charge of the prison, but he received the
same answer.

The Old Camper
The officers continued their investiga
tions and say they ascertained that Keith
worked as a street sweeper during the
day and In the evening he bought arti
cles from crooks and sold them to sec
ond-hand dealers at a good profit. He
said' he bought the bronze clock from a
man he did not know for 70 cents, and
was offering it for $2 when arrested, al
though It is said to be worth about $14.
Keith is a native of Germany and came
to this country a poor man fourteen
years ago. He is now 42 years of age. He
has been in the city for seven years and
for five years has been a street sweeper.
He refused to put up ball for his release
or to engage an attorney to defend him.
Among his papers were found answers
to an advertisement for a wife. He ad
mitted inserting the advertisement, but
said that the women who answered it
were not satisfactory and he was en
gaged to marry Miss Rose Bruder, a tel
ephone girl, who lives at 1134 Green street.
She was an old acquaintance and their
marriage had been fixed for next Jan
uary.
Conrad Keith, a street sweeper, who Is
alleged to be worth lrÂ» the neighborhood
of $20,000, was booked at the City Prison
yesterday morning by Detectives Ryan
and Taylor on a charge of petty larceny
and a bronze clock was booked as evi
dence against him. The detectives saw
Keith on Sunday night in a second-hand
store on Clay street, trying . to sell the
clock for $2, and as he refused to give a
satisfactory explanation of how he carria
into possession of the timepiece, he was
Jailed pending an investigation.
The detectives discovered that the clock
had been stolen from a house in Belden
place and they decided to search Keith's
room, at 913 Montgomery street, as they
had received an intimation that he was
something of a "fence" for thieves. They
found in a trunk nine watches, two gold
chains, four razors, live pairs of shears,
a large quantity of silver knives, forks
and spoons and a quantity of clothing.
They also found a. bag filled with one
cent pieces and near the bag nine bank
books and several certificates of stock
in a building and loan association. One
of the bank books showed a deposit of
nearly $1000 and the others lesser
amounts.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
ONLY A SUGGESTION.
But It Has Proven of Interest and
Value to Thousands.
Common sense would suggest that if !
one wishes to become fleshy and plump j
it can only result from the food we cat
and digest and that food should be al-
buminous or flesh forming food, like
eggs, beefsteak, and cereals; in other
words the kinds of food that make flesh
are the foods which form the greater
part of our daily bills of fare.
But the trouble is that while", we eat
enough and generally too much, the
stomach, from abuse and overwork, does
not properly digest and assimilate it,
which is the reason so many people re-
main thin and under weight; the digest-
ive organs do not completely digest the
food forming beefsteak and eggs and
similar wholesome food.
There are thousands of such who are
really â¢ confirmed . dyspeptics, Â¦ although
they may have no particular pain or in-
convenience from their stomachs.
