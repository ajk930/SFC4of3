Mr. and Mrs. Col had never before
taken a ride in an automobile, and they
hit upon the plan of making up a party
and trying the horseless carriage. The
start was made at about 8 o'clock, and
everything went ' well for a couple of
hours, at the end of which interval they
were not a gTeat distance from . home on
the return trip.
The chauffeur was driving the machine
at a good clip and was on the embank
ment at Willow street, near the creek.
The ladies engaged in a lively chat about
the delights of auto riding and the suc
cess of the outing, when without 'warning
the ponderous vehicle slipped from the
highway and went crashing nearly twenty
feet to the base of the embankment.
The terrified passengers had not an In
stant to think of escape. As the automo
bile went over it turned upside down and
landed on top of two or more of the
shouting and screaming occupants.
The chauffeur was the only person who
entirely escaped injury. He had been
thrown from the car and landed in j the
shrubbery. As quickly as . possible he
rushed to aid the Injured passengers, and
assistance was summoned.
The physicians found that the passenger
most seriously hurt is Mrs. de Salsset.
She suffered Internal injuries and her con

Special Dispatch to The Call.
The. circumstances under which the
deed was committed are of a sensational
character. Tomasheffski . had no occupa
tion and resided at a hotel. He was pas
sionately fond of. card playing and visited
a club every night, where he played for
hours for heavy, stakes and was, as a
rule % very fortunate. On the day of the
murder his cousin called at the hotel and
asked him to come to his mother's house
to' play cards with two friends of the
family. Then, at a given signal, he was
seized, his mouth covered so that he could
not cry for assistance and poison was in
jected under the skin of the forehead.
The three men then watched the effects
of the poison for about a half-hour. At
the same time taking the victim's money
from â¢ his pocket they divided it among
themselves.
' After their victim died they placed the
body In a basket and one of the men tied
a cord tightly around the throat, to make
sure, as he said, that there could be no
further trouble with the murdered man.
The perpetrators of the crime were con
fident their social position would prevent
any suspicion falling upon them. It was
only after a strong chain of evidence had
been completed that they confessed.
LONDON, Sept. 22.â A case of murder
by an Injection of poison by means of a
hypodermic syringe is reported by the
Moscow correspondent of the Daily Mall,
who writes that an unpleasant smell pro
ceeding from a wicker basket which ar
rived as - luggage at the Brest railway
station in Moscow and for" which no
claimant appeared caused an examination
to be made, when the body of a well
dressed man was found. An examination
showed that death had resulted from an
injection- of poison under the skin by
means of a syringe. Inquiries were insti
tuted which proved that the murdered
man was a well-to-do land owner named
Martin Tomasheffski.

The unfavorable replies of Austria and
Russia to Bulgaria's last note and the
fact that none of the other great powers
has yet replied, coupled with the allega
tions that one of the powers is encourag
ing the military party at the Yildiz Kiosk,
tend' to create a less hopeful feeling here.
There is, however, no , perceptible change
in the situation. Various reports are In
circulation regarding negotiations be
tween Turkey and Bulgaria looking to a
solution of the Macedonian difficulty.
The Dhevenlk says Turkey has present
ed a. note to Bulgaria asking for the lat
ter's assistance in reaching a practical so
lution. Bulgaria replied that Turkey, must
end' the massacres, withdraw her frontier
forces, guarantee peace and protection to
the villagers desiring to return to their
homes and amnesty to political offenders,
and Introduce such governmental reforms
as will pacify Macedonia and Adrlanople.
The Bulgarian reply concludes: '
"If the present situation continue the
Bulgarian Government will be compelled
to yield to public opinion and send an
army to the frontier."
It appears doubtful that the Government
has sent such an answer, but the state
ment published represents in some degree
the Government's attitude.

matter of the appointment of the retiring
Vali of Eeirut to be Vali of Brusa. At
present the officials are disposed to re
gard the appointment in the light of a
transfer rather than a promotion, but a
further inquiry into the facts by Minister
I-eiehman may change this view of the
case. It was said 'at the State Depart

"Theoretically we" wish the trade of the

receive it lest it should reduce the prices
of articles that are abnormally high and
from which great profits are made. In
this matter our legislation seems to keep
In mind only the present American dealer.
The consumer and the dealer who might
arise to handle, Philippine wares are ig
nored. . The Filipino dealers In tobacco
know that America is the land of high
prices and. they naturally wish to have
tÂ«e advantages of these prices. They csk,
therefore, for such a 'reduction of the
tariff as will enable them to sell their to
bacco in the. American market. This is
one of the few direct requests the Fili
pinos have made of the American Gov
ernment." In not grantmg It we show that
practically we do- not wish the trado.of

ity,, and it may be clearly Inferred from
thif-that we do not wish the trade of the
Philippines in any commodity the' lntro-
SOMETHING ABOUT TOBACCO.
"The trade that Is growing up with
Japan points to a vastly greater "trade
that may be developed with China, sup
plemented by the trade of the Philip
pine Islands. But before any very Im
portant results are reached wo shall have
to conclude that we wish the trade of the
East and take such legislative action as
will encourage it, for it is hardly to be
supposed that the wealth of the Orient
will be poured into our basket unless we
at least take off the lid.
"The fact that our route to the East Is
shorter than that of any other Important
European or American city is a matter of
some moment, but after all a few thou
sand miles of steaming, .more or less, are
not really determinative of. freight
charges. Not many months ago the
freight rate from Hongkong to Manila,
a distance of 600 miles, was as high as the
rate from San Francisco to Manila, a dis
tance of 7000 miles, and even this does
not argue that the San Francisco rate
wasMow. And the rate from Manila to
Vigan, a few hundred miles up the coast
of Luzon, was little, if any, less. Of
course, distance makes a possible lower
limit, but it is not distance In most cases
that makes the actual rate.
"The Europeans are not anxious to have
the products of the East reach us by. the
short route of the Pacific. They are will
ing we should buy these wares, but only
after they have carried them two-thirds
of the way around the world. They are,
therefore, making vigorous efforts to con
tinue the Oriental trade In Its ancient
channels. Each of the leading nations of
Europeâ England, France, Germany, Aus
tria, Holland, Spain and Italyâ has at
least one gTeat line of steamers engaged
in the trade of the Far East, and some of
them have more than one line. It hap
pened to be my fate, some months ago,
to be shut up for a few days in a quar
antine station on the - bank of the Suez
Canal. Ten or twelve Immense ocean
steamers went trooping by every day.
They told most eloquently of the peace
ful war Europe is making for the posses
sions of' the East. Some of these ships
carried the products of the Philippines,
and in this case the trade was surely dis
regarding the flag. They furnished, how
ever, an illustration of the familiar facts
that the currents of commerce, like the
currents of wind . and . water, flow where
there Is least obstruction.

The autopsy showed that death was oc
casioned by an alcoholic settlement in the
stomach. With this exception there was
nothing in that organ showing that the
deceased had partaken of any food for
some time, and if he had done so evidence
of it had passed away. This condition of
the stomach superinduced exhaustion,
which tended to hasten the final result.
The story published in some papers to
day to the effect that the stomach had
been taken to San Francisco for the pur
pose of having its contents analyzed by
surgeons, with a view of ascertaining
whether poisonous substances were pres
ent, is without foundation. That organ
of the deceased is still in this city in the
possession of the autopsy surgeon.

causes and that the idea of violence or

BOSTON, Sept. 2Lâ The Investigation
into the four check swindle of the Boston
and Northwestern Street Railway system,
which came to light last week, has led
the police to believe that fully one-half
of the conductors on this system have
been guilty of trading in bogus checks at
one time or another during the past three
years. The police express the belief that
the fraud will be found to extend to
ether street railway systems, including
those in some Western cities. President
Sullivan of the Boston and Northwestern
Street Railway system says the losses
would amount to J10.000.
Many Conductors Are Suspected.

Tbe Circuit Court of Appeals held that
the case against -Richards was not strong
enough to warrant his conviction on so
grave a charge.
PORTLAND, Sept. 21.â The United
States Circuit Court of Appeals met in
this city to-day, Judges Ross, Morrow and
Gilbert being on the bench.
In the case of Frank H. Richards,
United States Marshal of Alaska, con
victed of contempt of court, at Nome, the,
judgment of the lower court was re
versed and the case remanded back for a
new trial.
The alleged contempt of court occurred
in April, 1902, in the case of Joseph H.
Wright, who as postmaster at Nome,
Alaska, was charged with embezzlement
of Government funds. It was charged
that Richards in the selection of the Jury
secured men who were intimate friends
of the accused man, and men who would
render a verdict in his favor.
Federal Jurists Pass on
the Case of Marshal
Richards.
The man for the past few months had
made many threats to end his existence
and his family were not surprised at his
rash act.
It was a deliberate case of suicide ap
parently. The man was identified as
Henry Metherill, who last week worked
on the Fuller ranch. The suicide's hat
was found lying beside the bridge Tailing,
placed there no doubt to attract attention.
The rope used was about twenty Inches In
length. The strands had been carefully
divided, a slip-knot was placed around the
neck, the strands of rope being doubled.
The man must have slowly strangled to
death.
CORONA, Sept. 21.â Early this morning
some Chinese discovered the body of a
man 60 years of age dangling by a short
rope which was securely fastened to an
upright of the railing of the Auburndale
bridge, which spans the Santa Ana River
about four miles northwest of Corona.

The people of Tacorfpa, a small village
near the Lucera ranch, on hearing of the
rcid became alarmed for their own safety
and at last accounts were preparing to re-
Eist any attack made by the bandits.
The bandits had evidently been In
formed that a shipment of silver had re
cently been received by the ranch pro
prietor in payment for a bunch of cattle.
When they swooped down upon the ranch
Lucera was immediately picked out and
threatened with Instant death if tbe hid
ing place of the money was not revealed.
Lucera, seeing that they meant to carry
out their threats, lost no time in turning
over the money. The booty was packed
on several horses, which the robbers se
cured at the ranch, and part of the men
stood guard while the balance made for
the mountains with the plunder. When
the first party had been given a sufficient

followed them.
TUCSON, Ariz., Sept 2Lâ A dispatch
to the Nogales Times from La Colorado,
Sonora, states that on Saturday night
an armed force of fifteen bandits raided
the rancho of Francisco Lucera, near San
Juanlco. and that they were successful in
securing JGOOO In silver. The raiders were
not Yaquis, as was first reported, but
were professional bandits. They outnum
bered the men on the ranch at the time,
who made no resistance and were at the
mercy of the bandits, who when they se
cured the loot left without committing
further crime.

The Secretary and the President are
being kept in close communication with

Of the more material things, sutfh as
sewers, hospitals and schools, they were
held to be such absolute necessities that
argument in favor of them was wholly un
necessary. It was In the artistic progres
slveness of San Francisco in streets and
parksâ and incidentally In home gardensâ
that the speaker most concerned himself,
and the conclusion was reached that
money expended in parks\ and play
grounds could In a short time be deducted
from the sums given over to excessive
police protection and the support of re
form schools and jails.
At the conclusion of the address, Mr.
"Wheelan was warmly thanked by Miss
Lucy Adams, the president of the society,
on behalf of the members and guests,
who evidently regretted their constitu
tional disability to profit by the speaker's
addressâ by voting a straight good vote
for the bond issue. But they unanimously
agreed to get their husbands, brothers
and sons into line, and the result may be
quite as satisfactory as if the sex ques
tion hadn't handicapped them as law
makers.
programme of unusual excellence
was rendered. Fairfax Wneelan, the
well known clubman and member of the
Merchants' Association, gave a talk upoi
the "City Beautiful," "a subject particu
larly apropos at this time. Mr. Wheelan
has in the past been closely identified
with various movements on lines of civic
and social progress, and the matter of
the bond issue that is now before the
people has appealed strongly to him from
the varied standpoints of a business man,
a humanitaiinn, and a devotee of art.
The lecturer, while pointing out the com
mercial advantages to be gained, dwelt
extensively upon the relation existing be
tween civic beautiflcatlon and moral de
velopment, and while the thought was ap
parently a revelation to many of the
ladies, the fact was brought home with
such Indisputable logic that it carried
conviction with it. Said Mr. Wheelan:
In New York City, when the matter of out
door cultivation was obtaining a foothold in
the minds of the people, Abram Hewitt, thea
Mayor of the city, summoned the police offi
cers from the poorer districts to his office for
the purpose of locating the spota on the city's
map where the Juvenile inhabitants gave the
most trouble. "Put your finger upon the dis
trict to which you are most frequently called
by Juvenile depredations," said he to each','
and at the close of the investigation it was
discovered â Indisputably and without excep
tion â that those plague spots were the tree
less and gardenias places of the district;- that
where gardens nourished, ' or trees . grew, . or
a Dark existed, tiiorp Infraction of- the law
was comparatively infrequent. , â¢ r â¢
Excerpts from experiments by Eastern
sociologists and teachers were read,
pointing out as clearly as undemonstrated
things can be, "that wherever trees and
flowers were planted, or parks established
In the school locality, there discipline was
materially improved, and the moral status
showed development." Tiny buds grew
upon the strange new plants, and by the
gentle enforcement of restraint, these
were allowed to bloom into beauty by the
interested tykes to whose honor their
care was intrusted. Thus trust, honor,
and an interest In the things of the inani
mate world were brought out, and a love
of the beautiful in color and form devel
oped; and as these things are an integral
part of good character, the results were
well worth the time and expense given
the experiment. -
Thus did Mr. Wheelan strive to impress
upon the guestsâ and that he succeeded
was evident by the warm applause given
him â that San Francisco must do for her
children what other progressive localities
had done, and noted especially the city, of
Harrlsburg, where the bonding of the city
has lifted it into a plane of prosperity,
health and happiness.

MONTEREY, Sept. 21.-Mrs. I* Wash
burn, wife of the poundmaster, was the
victim of a most brutal assault this
morning, the crime being aggravated by
the age of the unfortunate woman, who is
more than 60 years old.
Early to-day Mrs. Washburn, who lives
at Seaside, a half-mile from Del Monte,
was returning along the beach to her
home, having placed her cow in a pas
ture. A man sprang out upon her, felled
her by striking her on the back of the
neck, and the fall, she says, deprived her
of consciousness. Her assailant then tore
up portions of her dress, which he stuffed
into the woman's mouth as a gag.
When Mrs. Washburn came to her
senses she crawled home and notified her
husband, who quickly got word to Sheriff
Nesbttt. A number of posses were soon
on the road and several arrests were
made on suspicion.
To-night Nesbitt arrested at Moro Cojo
a man about 27 years old, who refused to
give his name or any account of himself.
His face was scratched and his shirt torn.
He was taken before- Mrs. Washburn,
who positively identified him as her as

Boundary Commission continued his argu
ment on behalf of Canada, citing the ut
terances of American officials and pas
sages in the American case which he
claimed upheld the Canadian contention.
The Attorney General claimed that the
inlets of Alaska must be considered ter
ritorial waters. In this connection Lord
Chief Justice Alverstone called the At
torney General's attention to the con
tention of the Norwegian Commissioners
in the Bering Sea arbitration that the
waters of the fords of Norway were ter
ritorial and that the coast of that penin
sula consequently represented a line
drawn from headland to headland.
The Attorney General claimed that this
principle should be applied to Alaska.
Lord Alverstone apparently was unwill
ing to bind himself to such a sweeping
application and suggested-that owing to
geographical peculiarities it was impos
sible to apply, to Alaska principles ap
plicable elsewhere.
The Attorney General quoted the con
tention of the United States in the Ber
ing Sea arbitration in support of the Can
adian view of territorial waters, but as
the American contention did not prevail
on that occasion, Lord Alvertsone said It
could not now be used in favor of Can
ada.
Attorney General Finlay occupied the
entire day.

CHICAGO, Sept. 21.â A bold attempt by
two men to lock themselves in a Michigan
Central Railroad \express car with the ex
press messenger, overpower him after the
train had left the yards at Thirteenth
street, and then rifle the two safes in the
car was frustrated Sunday evening. Wil
liam Ganghin, an expressman, was
knocked unconscious and gagged in the
express car shortly after 8 o'clock in the
evening and then the men discovered he
was not the express messenger, and fear
ing detection, fled. This is the theory of
the railroad officials. The express mes
senger who has charge of the car left
Chicago at 3:30 this morning with one
guard and about $25,000 in two safes in the
car. This money, it is believed, was the
object of the attack of the two men.
Ganghin was taken to the hospital and
it was found that his shoulder had been
dislocated and he had sustained severe
bruises. If he had not been discovered in
the car' in time, the physicians say he
would have smothered to death because of
the gag in his mouth.
Ganghin says nothing was taken from
him by the robbers, which leads him to
believe he received a beating intended
for Express Messenger Hall.
According to the railroad officials eight
or ten weapons are usually kept In the
car. Every evening except Sunday the
car leaves for the East at 9:30 o'clock.
At 8:30, the time of the attack last night,
Hall with an assistant loaded the money
into the car and locked himself in. On
Sunday the train does not leave until 3:30
a. m., and it is believed the change in
schedule on Sunday frustrated the rob
bers' plans.
The news of the extensive purchase
confirms the reports which have been cir
culated in University circles for some
time that the largest medical school in
the world is to oe established on the
Midway. Rush Medical College will form
the nucleus of the institution and it will

and James O'Brien.
Parks again arose and fairly roared:
"No one has more respect for Kansas
City members of the organization than
I have. But you'll find when you -get
down to examining credentials that a
number of persons traveled 'all the way
here from New York and expect to get
into this meeting. I'm here to help bar
them out and there are a whole lot more
of delegates who will be glad to disbar
them."
KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Sept. 21.â
The committee on credentials of
the International Bridge and
Structural Iron- Workers" con
vention, it is said to-night, will
report against the seating of Samuel
Parks, of the New York union, when the
convention meets to-morrow morning.
The report against seating the suspended
New York union will, it is eaid, be signed
by five of the seven members of the com
mittee. Delegates Flaherty of Pittsburg
and O'Brien of Pueblo will bring in a mi
nority report favoring the . seating of
Parks and the other seven delegates from
New York. Parks and his followers will
make a, strong fight in the convention,
but the 'outlook for success on their part
is not of the brightest.
President Buchanan called the conven
tion to order at 10:30 this morning, and,
without attempting to address the dele
gates, introduced Mayor James A. Reed,
who extended the city's welcome. When
John Smith, an official in the Industrial
Council of Kansas City, had finished his
response on behalf of the convention
Samuel Parks jumped to his feet. He
wanted to know if the convention had
been called as a gathering of organized
labor or as a public meeting. There were
i in the hall, he said 'some not rightly del
'Â¦ egates to the convention, and he re
quested that these be removed.
Several delegates attempted to gain the
; attention of the chair, but President Bu
chanan ordered the convention to pro
ceed with the next order of business,
the receipt. of credentials of the different
unions.
Another delegate arose and asked:
' "How can this convention be called to
order until credentials have been passed
on to show who is entitled to sit here?"
President Buchanan replied: "The
proper order of business is the presenta
tion of credentials, and no business can
be done until the credentials have been
passed upon." 2
Parks sprang to his feet again.
"I approve of that ruling," he said,
"and when they are passed on you'll find
a lot of members of Kansas City No. 10
that'll be not allowed in the hall."
A member of No. 10 retorted: "It's my
opinion that any man who carries an In
ternational card is all right to stay in this
convention. I hope that no member of
No. 10 will take at heart this insult just
offered."
The President's attitude toward union
labor came up before Columbia Typo
graphical Union No. 101 yesterday in the
form of a resolution criticizing his course
in the Miller case. The purport of the
resolution was very similar to that adopt
ed and sent throughout the country by
the Central Labor Union. Action on the
resolution, however, was indefinitely post
poned following a statement by a mem
ber that a conference on the subject was
soon to be held between President Rooa#

any action In the meantime would be In

WHEELER SPEAKS.
But there Is a strong probability that the
Filipino labor force will Increase as the sense
of Individual Independence Increases and move
men to break away from their positions of
semi-dependence on their employers. But this
movement of the Filipino toward the position
of the American laborer will probably be slow,
and In the meantime there ought to be a de
mand for more laborers than are at present
available. To this point It Is safe and easy
going. What lies beyond Is a rough road of
diverse opinions.
An It regards the continental territory of
the United States it Is not difficult to frame
a more or less convincing argument in sup
port of the policy involved In the law of ex
clusion; on the ground that the Inconvenience
of getting rich more slowly and unable
to' adjust our households to the Oriental model
Is not lo be compared with the inconvenience
of havlne another race problem on our hands.
But when the Inquiry relates to the Philip
pine Islands the conclusion that applies .here
does not necessarily apply there. Here It
would be bringing together two alien races,
the two most positive and strongest races In
the world, that It would be better to keep
apart. There it would be bringing together,
pot two races, but two kindred peonies, of
whose amalgamation nature seems to approve.
But whether they enter Into elose association
or remain distinct is not a matter of great
moment. The undisputed fact Is that there
ia room for more laborers In the Philippine
Islands to redeem the country from the re-
BUlts of the neglect It suffered In war aad to
make available Hs .vaet undeveloped resources.
If there were only limited resources the
weaker might go to the wall, but the resources
are adequate to the support of a population
of CO. 000. 000. The addition, therefore, of a
few hundred thousand Chinese would drive
nobody to the wall, but by making the islands
more productive would ameliorate the condi
tion of the whole Increased population.
If one was to attempt to make a . compre
hensive statement of the economic status of
the Philippine Islands It would not be difficult
to form a fairly just estimate of the several
Â¦ material elements. But a considerable diffi
culty would arise In attempting to estimate the
labor force of the islands as a necessary factor
In the general statement. This is the most
; uncertain element In the problem. , It Is un
certain because as yet no one knows what la to
be the result of the awakening of the Filipinos
out of their mediacvallsm. â¢ â¢ â¢
â¢ THE LABOR QUESTION.
Judgo Taft, first as president of the com
mission and then as Civil Governor, was the
central figure In the work of making a gov
ernment for the Philippine Islands. He was
the official leader by virtue of his appoint
ment by the President. He was the real
leader by virtue of his intellectual power.
His own way was marked out for him by his
strong sense of Justice and his faith In hu
man nature, and he was supported from first
to last by the complete loyalty of his asso
ciates.
TRIBUTE TO TAFT.
It has been said that England's govern
mental dependencies have been the great
schools in which she has trained her most
distinguished statesmen. It is quite possible
that America's governmental dependencies will
servo a similar purpose. Governor Taft went
to the Philippines with the reputation of a
great lawyer; he will return with the added
reputation of a great administrator; and those
who wish the welfare of their country may
look with satisfaction to the possible rise of
circumstances In which the nation as a whole
will receive the advantages of his distin
guished administrative ability.
It is fortunate in this connection that the
affairs of our possession in the Far East, In
to far as they are directed from Washington.
are to be In the hands of . one . who has un
rivaled knowledge of the islands, a profound
sympathy with the best aspirations of the
people and Just and liberal Ideas respecting
the commercial relations of th* Philippines and
the United States. A powerful supporter of
all Just measures relating to the mutual in
terests of California and the Philippine Islands
will be found In Governor Taft as Secretary of
War.
Our geographical position, our magnificent
harbor and our production of wares demanded
In the Orient determine iCallfornla's para
mount interest In the rising trade with the
lands bordering on the Pacific.
Professor Moses made extended refer
ence to the other products and possibili
ties of our island possessions, and, con
tinuing, said:
"What the Filipinos wish is not such a
tariff reduction as will enable them to
undersell the American dealer and thus
disturb the market, but only such a re
duction as will enable them to sell at ex
isting prices and make a profit not greater
than the American's profit. They are ask
ing for only such considerations as will
indicate that the abundant talk about the
benefits of American rule will, not appear
to them as rank hypocrisy or a delusive
mockery. They do not wish words, but
some tangible sign of desirable trade rela
tions with the United States.
NOT DEMANDING FREE TRADE.
"The Filipinos are not demanding free
trade, for it is recognized by those who
have the interests of the Filipinos In mind
that it may be advantageous for yet many
years for the Philippines to have a sepa
rate fiscal organization and policy."
ductlon of which would srive the consum
ers an advantage greater than 'that they
now possess.

"These three officers," says Admiral

their brother officers blush with shame to

for that was the smallest number re

so little Interest in maintaining the honor,

so small an Idea of the binding quality

CHICAGO, Sept. 21.â The complete
record oÂ£ the court martial case of Assist

the Atlantic station, received at the Navy
Department to-day, contains a severe
criticism by Rear Admiral Evans of the
court which tried* Nicholson because of
the Inadequacy of the punishment Inflicted
by the, court. It was alleged that while
on shore at Chefoo, China, Nicholson be
came intoxicated and assaulted an elderly
civilian. The sentence of the court was
that Nicholson be reduced five numbers
in his grade. Rear Admiral Evans In re
viewing the case says the evidence-was of
such a character that the sentence should
have been nothing less than dismissal
from the navy. Three officers of the court
recommended clemency.

Strange and often weird experiences In

country. There has never been a time In
the history of the world when the sub

exponent of these abstruse subjects, win

and mediumship. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall Is

addition to science. Himself possessed

NEW HAVEN, Conn.. Sept. a.â Miss
Julia Marlowe made her first appearance
here this season in the new play, "Fools
of Nature," by Henry V. Esmond, at the
Hyperion to-night. The comedy was well
received and Miss Marlowe, who for thÂ«j
first time in her stage life took the part
of a society woman, was enthusiastically
received. The setting 13 English and the
story centers about the infatuation of
Cecil Bannister for Martia, Lady Braches
ter (Miss Marlowe) In love with whom
also is Captain Jim Chivel (Frank Worth-
Ing). The latter through self-sacrlflco
prevents Martia defying social laws.
W. T. Lovell, an English actor, created
the part of Cecil Bannister, and he. with
Worthing, shared the attention given to
Miss Marlowe. After the third act Es
mond was called before the curtain.
The Sothern production la a comedy of
rare beauty, with an Interesting story
set off by elaborate scenery. Miss Harned
received an ovation, and after the first
act the audience compelled Sothern to
come before the footlights and make a
speech. Mlsa Harned. after this week,
will open In Cincinnati in "Iris," and after
a tour in her last year's play that will
extend as far as the Pacific Coast she
will put Sothern's play on the stage In
New York, beginning about the middle of
January.
The dramatization of "Checkers" pro
duced a play full of action that would
probably draw well aside from, the In
terest attracted to ft by the book. The
play introduced Thomas W. Ross as a
star, and he, with Miss Katherine Mul
klns. was heartily applauded. The prin
cipal parts are all excellently taken and
to-night's audience approved the play as
worthy of a Ions run.
PHILADELPHIA. Sept. 21.â Kyrle Bel
lew opened his season here to-night in
the Garrlck Theater In his new play,
"Rafflea," an original production taken
from Hornung'9 "Tales of the Amateur
Cracksman." The house was well filled
and the production wa/i favorably re
ceived. Bellew is ably assisted by E. M.
Holland, who played the part of a de
tective, a character similar to that in
"Jim the Penman," which he created
years ago.
NEW YORK. Sept. 21.â In the Brooklyn
Academy of Music to-night Henry W.

The Central Theater capped the climax
last night and captured a packed house
with its revival of Dion Boudcault's
thrilling melodrama, "After Dark.". The
audience, was given a surfeit of exciting
incidents and the tumultuous applause
proved that the famous old play has lost
none of its power to fascinate and en

LONDON, Sept. 2Lâ The Times' corre

the situation In Servia, in which he says
the military^ conspiracy at Nlsh jdlrected
at the regicides Is Ta.r graver than the
Government dare- acknowledge. Of a to
tal of 1500 officers 1000 are said to be con
cerned in It, and probably the bulk of the
nation Becretly sympathize with them.
The clique of assassins, however, holds
all the chief civil and military offices, the
keys of the arsenal and the treasury, and
any one crossing' Its path Is doomed. The
King Is surrounded, and many doubt If
he will-ever shake himself free. Minister
Gentchitch, In whoso house the regicide
plot -was. hatched and who conducted the
secret negotiations with King Peter, Is al
leged to possess an Incriminating: letter,
which Is kept hanging over the royal
head. Lately, however, the regicides are
beginning to realize that they have gone
too far and must moderate their attitude.
The elections are looked forward to with
considerable Interest.

The programme at the Orpheum this
week leaves little to be desired. There
are two good acrobatic turns, a clever

Indian princess with a very fine so

Kousbys electrical display. Altogether
they give a show hard to beat, either for
cleverness or variety. â¢
Orpheum.
"The Adventure of the Lady Ursula,"
one of Anthony Hope's most light and
graceful creations. Is also one of Florence
Roberts' most pleasing characterizations.
Her portrayal of the character has the
added merit that it is singularly free from
mannerismsâ the little outdropplngs of in
dividuality that so often blemish the most
artistic work. Indeed, It may -be said
truthfully that the Lady Ursula is ap
parent all the time 'and Florence Roberts
is Invisible. It is only consummate art
that renders this . possible, and that art
has long ago been conceded as being hers.
The audience that applauded' her last
night filled the house to the doors and
was more than' ordinarily select and In
telligent, one that was quick to respond to
the delicate flashes of humor in the play
and to the nicety of the acting. It was,
however, a persistent audience and would
not be denied when it recalled Miss Rob
erts and Mr. Henderson at the close of
the pretty third act after the admirable
love scene between Ursula and Sir George
Sylvester, who, as personated by Lucius
Henderson, is made abnormally handsome
for a mlsogamlst. Mr. Henderson is ex
cellent support, manly, and with sufficient
pulchritude of form and feature to render
It easy for the audience .to sympathize
with Lady Ursula for falling in love with
him. He dresses elegantly also, the time
of the play, In the latter end of the ro
mantic days, enabling all the characters
to do 60, and he possesses the rare faculty
of being virile without coarseness, and
refined without effeminacy. Outside of
these two leading roles there is not much
for the remaining members of the com
pany to do. In the small part of Mrs.
Fenton, Miss Fanny Young proves a good
fit, acting the old lady with becoming dig
nity. Miss Bertha Blanchard Is very ac
ceptable as Dorothy. William - Yerrance
exhibits considerable character in his
handling of the part of Rev. Mr. Blimboe,
but at times he coarsened the personation
In the attempt to be funny. But every

Kolb, Dill, Bernard and the ojher fun
makers continue to extend "The Glad
Hand" to crowded houses at Fischer's
Theater, which was packed to the doors
last night. It is composed of the best
selections from the Weber & Fields' suc
cesses and the fun is kept up from start
to finish. The doll scene excites the
rislbles of the audience to the highest
point. The songs of Miss Amber, Miss
Jenkins, Winfleld Blake, Harry Hermsen,
Miss Vldot and Misses Hope and Emer
son are catchy and tuneful, especially
"My Cocoanut Lu," by Blake. "The Con
curers," a travesty on the play "The
Conquerors," Is also full of fun. One of
the most taking features in It is the quar
tet, "Honey, Will You M*bs Me When I'm
Gone?" which was repeated several times
last night. The audience could not get
enough of the song, "It Was the Dutch,"
by Kolb, Dill and Bernard. Miss Am
ber's song, "My Pauline," was charmingly
rendered and received with vociferous ap
plause. The song and dance, "Honey,
Send Home for Money," by Flossie Hope
and Gertie Emerson, proved not the least
attractive feature of the travesty.
Fischer's.
Next week comes James Neil and a spe
cially' selected company In "A Gentleman
of France."
Ivy , Pollard, in the title role, was as
charming as ever. Her part Is a difficult
one and she handles It in a very credit
able manner. Irene Gouldlng was another
young miss who charmed her hearers
with the music of her voice' and who
shows great talent for acting. Willie Pol
lard, in the character of an old salt,
created plenty of amusement with topical
songs and eccentric dances. He Is a born
comedian. Connie Pollard, and Willie
Thomas also had humorous parts, . In
which they appeared very advantageous
ly. The other little ones, of the company
furnished support commensurate with the
work of the principals.
"Dorothy" will be presented' this even
ing and to-morrow night. Thursday and
Friday nights and the Saturday matinee
will be given to the production of that
old favorite, "H. M. S. Pinafore." The
last performance of the -company's en
gagement will be "The Belle of New
York," In which the children have been
particularly successful.
The clever little children of the Pollard
company presented "Paul Jones" very
successfully at the Grand Opera-house
last night. The opera Is full of interest
ing features and the talented juveniles
made the most of every opportunity. The'
audience expressed its full appreciation of
the production with continual applause.
The little people of the stage appeared to
enjoy It all as much as any of their hear
ers. The opera has a nautical setting,
nearly all the songs are new and catchy.
Daphne Pollard, the precocious 5-year
old, was the favorite of the audience. She
was encored time and again after each of
her special performances. Alice Pollard
was also particularly pleasing in a part
which gave her ample opportunity to
demonstrate her exceptional vocal ability.
Her pretty face and sweet voice are
enough of capital to make her a star in
any company.

George P. Webster, in the character of
Old Tom, and Ernest Howell, in the He
brew impersonation of Dicey Morris, won
the audience. Herschel Mayall, Eugenie
Thais Lawton, Edwin T. Emery, Henry
Shumer and Genevieve Kane furnished
portrayals that were artistic and satis
fflng and which called forth frequent
plaudits. The cast Is unusually large and
well balanced.
In the Elysium Music Hall scene there
were enough, clever specialties to make
up a vaudeville show. Myrtle Vane and
Millar Bacon sang a burlesque duet with
fine effect and Miss Vane rendered In an
admirable style Lee Johnson's new song,
"My Pauline," assisted by Mr. Bacon and
Myrtle Dingwall. Little Beyna Belasco
delighted the house with her clog and
buck and wing dancing, and "Kid" Mor
ris, a 9-year-old boxer, surprised every
body with his cleverness at fisticuffs. Pro
fessor Al Hazzard's ventrlloquial essay
was a rich entertainment and his laugh
ing sons scored a big success in the gal
lery. All the specialties were heartily en
cored. ,â¢ Â¦ *
The star number of the programme is
"The American Girl," Mlsa Frigranza's
song, where girls from the different cities
make their characteristic bows. Here
was the only gold brick of the comedy.
Miss San Francisco, in other cities the
breezy person who appears on the pictures
outside the theater in redâ like the girl
in last Sunday's colored supplement of
this paperâ came out In demure and Nile
ful green, with the manner of a born
Duchess. If you really want to know,
Miss San Francisco is the girl on the
other side, humorously labeled Gotham.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Miss Trixie Friganza, a large-eyed
handsomely made girl, with a pleasant
voice and stunning wardrobe, is the femi
nine star. MIs3 Friganza brings style,
chic and spirit to the widow's role and
made a smashing central figure. She has
a rose gown that deserves a column itself.
Idalene Cotton, whose welcome stopped
the comedy for some moments, was a sin
gle sparkle as a French maid, light of
heel, inspired of accent and with more zip
to the moment than goes to most hours.
Nick Long (for who could separate this
favored couple?) was a wonder as a con
cierge. One wished for more of these two.
Arthur Donaldson, a Swedish actor,
once an Ibsenite, was a dashing.. Prince
of Pilsen proper. He is generally effec
tive, sings well, looks well and has the
proper bravado for the part. One very
pretty song he has is "Pictures in the
Smoke." Another song that carries Is

is one of the funniest ever heard here.
Everything from the invention of sauer
kraut to the building of the Shamrock is
here unctuously ascribed to the father
lander, and Mr. Dandy sang it to the tune
of several encores.
The audience at the Tlvoli met its first
disappointment of the season last even-
Ing. "Carmen" was to be put on with
Signorina Cleo Marchesini in the title
role. Yesterday the Signorina was afflict
ed with a sore throat and the manage
ment was compelled to put out the an
nouncement that "Carmen" would not be
performed until to-morrow evening, ow
ing to the Indisposition of Marchesini.
A large audience assembled, but many
went away when it was apparent that
the Carmen who is new to San Fran
cisco wajs not to appear. In place of
"Carmen," "La Sonnambula" was given
with the same caBt as before, Including
Tromben, Dado, Tedeschl, Zani, Welch
and Nettle Deglow. The house was very
well filled. The applause in places was
quite marked, but the disappointment at
the necessity for substituting "La Son
nambula" for "Carmen" was manifest.
This evening "La Travlata" will be
given. To-morrow evening "Carmen"
will be performed. These two opera3
will alternate during the remainder of
the week.

"Much is due to the part the church

sixteenth century progress in art was

What has Shakespeare done for woman?
He has exalted her as no other writer
has ever done. Examine his plays and
in the one hundred women characters
there are not more than six of whom any

"The Prince of Pilsen" has no particu
lar plot to affright the idle. In fact It
seems to be all those things musical
comedy should be and to have left un
done all those things it ought not to have
done. Hans Wagner is the center of the
story. Hans is a Cincinnati brewer, who
finds himself mistaken In Nlca for the
Prince of Pilsen, who Is expected there.
He" has a daughter, the Prince has an
affectional vacancy and a sense of humor,
there is an oh, so attractive New York
widow, and there you are. Simplicity
Itself. The Prince ! of cwirse abets the
mistake of the Nice people and marries
Hans' daughter, Hans pairing off with
the widow. But this simple and by no
means youthful material Is worked up
with notable skill and fun. Comical scene
follows comical scene as fa3t as the
Orpheum biograph runs, anil they all
seem new. Then there isn't the shadow
of a sextette, and the trail of "The Lit
tle Duchess" is far from it. The jokea
seem born on the spot, not lugged in from
everywhere else. So, also, the lyrics. Al
together, as the prelude of the lighter
winter fare, the end of the serious sea
son, "The Prince of Pilsen" is about as
attractive stuff as one could ask.
IF the bunch of musical comedies that
Impend at all resemble "The Prince
of Pilsen," whose first night was
last night at the Columbia, there Is
joy ahead for the public and critic.
"Where so lately Dick Dudgeon went to
his death with an epigram on his lips,
and Villon flung defiant verse in Louis'
teeth, Hans Wagner now asks: "Vos
you effer in 'Tinzlnnati?' " This may not
be inherently funny, but it looks that
way with Jess Dandy behind it. Not that
this is the whole humor of It. The lines
of "The Prince of Pilsen" can be laughed
at without strain, and there are besides
whistleful lyrics galore, a hilarious story,
point, fun, and a cast of glittering effec
tiveness. Needs not be said with a Henry
Savage production that the scenic sldÂ©
is all it should be, and the frou-frou of
the freshest and smartest.

The appearance of the Deity in the pro

feature not usually followed in the pro

that the Introduction of the Deity added

Two Women Are Arrested.
Nothing further was done in the matter
and Bachman left the building without
further loss of Time.
All the witnesses except the one on the
stand were excluded from the courtroom,
and when Bachman left the room Wnn's
putative father. Won Ah Li. was called.
When asked as to the purchases testified
to by Bachman he made b flat denial and
said that he had not been in the Bach
man store within a year at the latest.
Banning called Bachman into the room
and after introducing him. to Deputy
T'nlted States Marshal Benas, said:
"You have committed perjury in this
case, and if I ever catch you In this
courtroom again I'll have you arrested."
"Well." said Bachman, shaking all over,
"I want to explain to you."
"I don't want anything to say to you,"
purtued 'Banning.
At this juncture O. P. Etidjer. attorney
for Won Ah Foo, came up and said: "Oh,
Lord, why did you swear that way?"
"There!" said Bannins. "your own at
t"rnev admits that you were lying."
The grilling of Bachman occurred dur
ir.g the taking of a deposition In the case
of Won Ah Foo, a Chinese arrested in
Montana for being unlawfully In the
country. Won claimed to be a native of
Fan Francisco and called as his principal
white witness young Bachman. Bachman
swore that he knew AVon since infancy
and knew that Won was a native of San
Francisco's Chinatown. He also knew
Won'e rejected father and saw him not
later than a month ago, when the ven
â¢ rable gentleman who poses as Won's
father came Into the hardware store and
made several extensive cash purchases.
Among the Items of this transaction
were six axes, six saws end other useful
implements.

ceived yesterday from First Assistant
United States Attorney J2. J. Banning re
mains green.
His Testimony Is Refuted
by That of an Old
Mongolian.
Attorney Drury also forced the drug
clerk to admit that prescriptions were left
on a file for one or two weeks before
they were pasted In the prescription book,
and the witness further admitted that
Peterson further testified that he iden
tified Mrs. Sutton as the woman who pre
eented the forged prescription on account
of the "peculiar look in her eyes and by
the dark circles under her eyes."
On his nrevlous examination Peterson
was unable to give any evidence to thow
that he had. noted anything peculiar about
the person who had presented the forged
prescription. He was unable to say at
that time If the person had worn a hat
or a coat, or veil, or any other particular
garments.
Attorney Drury, for the defense, sub
jected Peterson to a rigid cross-examina
tion. He forced the witness to admit that
he had not previously testified to any
peculiar trait* of the woman who pre
sented the forged prescription because "he
had forgotten to do so, and he had not
-tjeen asked to testify on that particular
line."
IDENTIFIED BY HER EYES.
Peterson testified that since- he was last
examined he had refreshed his memory
by consulting the prescription book of the
drug store in which he was employed.
He testified that the forged prescription
for the arsenic was presented and filled
by him on August 20, last, after 3 p. m.
and before 6 p. m.
J. C. Peterson, the drug clerk at the
store at Fifth and Clementina streets,
who previously testified to having sold an
ounce of arsenic on a forged prescription
hearing the signature "Dr. McLaughlin,"
and who claimed that the forged pre
scription had been presented to him by
Mrs. Sutton. the sister of Mrsr Bowers,
was recalled by the prosecution.
The prosecution then presented the tes
timony of a number of saloon keepers to
prove that Mrs. Martha E. Bowers was in
the habit of drinking with Patrick Ler
vey during the live months previous to
the dtath of Martin L. Bowers. The de
fense objected to the introduction of this
line of evidence as being immaterial to
the charge of murder, but Judge Cabaniss
allowed it to be introduced subject to a
general objection on the part of the de
fense. The testimony of the saloon keep
ers was introduced by the prosecution In
crder to carry out the theory that inti
mate relations had existed between Pat
rick Lervey and Mrs. Bowers, thus fur
nishing a motive for the alleged murder
of Bowers by his wife.
the Superior Court by Police
Judge Cabaniss yesterday. Her sister,
Mrs. Zylpha C. Sutton, who was accused
by the prosecution of having purchased
the deadly drug that caused the death of
Bowers, was dismissed from custody. '
The hearing of testimony yesterday ac
cupied two sessions and elaborate argu
ments were made for the* prosecution and
the defense.
The evidence offered by the prosecution
consisted of the testimony of Robert Kav
anaugh. paying teller of the Hlbernia
Savings and Loan Society, and a number
of witnesses who testified to seeing- Mrs.
Martha E. Bowers and Patrick Lervey
together on many occasions.
Kavanaugh, the bank clerk, testified
that Martin L. Bowers and his wife,
Martha E. Bowers, had a joint account
in the bank in which he was employed.
He testified that on August 27, last, Mrs.
Bowers drew from the bank the- Bum of
J250S. The prosecution sought to show by
this witness that Mrs. Bowers had a
financial motive in causing the death of
her husband, but the defense brought out
In cross-examination that In a joint bank
account either party had a perfect right
to draw the money from the bank at any
time. The defense was prepared to show
that Mrs. Bowers drew the money from
the bank because her brother-in-law,
Harry Bowers, sought to secure an in
junction to prevent her from touching the
money on deposit.

prescriptions were not always numbered
consecutively and dated at the time they
were presented for filling, but that this
was done later on.
Police Officer Tom Coleman testified to
finding a note book at the Bowers home.

evidence that the forged prescription was
written on a page torn from this note
book r.nd that the texture of the paper
was the, same as that of a note written

CAbE CLOSED AND ARGUED.
After District Attorney Byington had
announced that the case was closed for
the people. Attorney Drury. for the de
fense, moved for a dismissal. Judge Ca
baniss stated that he would hear argu
ments of counsel at the afternoon session
of court, and the hearing was then ad
journed until 3:20 p. m. V
At the afternoon session of court At
torney Drury, for the defense, again re
newed his motion to dismiss the defend
ants. He claimed that a public offense
had not been established and if estab
lished that there was not sufficient evi
dence to connect the accused women with
the crime.
Attorney Drury skillfully argued that
while the evidence showed that four
grains of arsenic had been discovered in
the stomach of Martin L. Bowers
there was no proof that the presence of
the four grains of poison had caused
death. He said that no proof had been
presented to show that arsenic had been
discovered in the circulation of the de
ceased and that the only direct testimony
of death was that of Autopsy Surgeon
Bacigalupi to the effect that death was
due to fatty degeneration of the kidneys
and that the state of the kidneys might
have been due to natural causes or to
other reasons.
The counsel for the two women further
argued that the prosecution had not pre
sented the slightest proof to establish Its
theory that Bowers had been subjected
to systematic arsenical poisoning for a
period of three months.
SCORES THE DRUG CLERK.
The only evidence of the purchase of
arsenic was that of the drug clerk, Pe
t .-non, argued Attorney Drury, and he
had testified that he was of opinion that
Mrs. Sutton was the person who had pre
sented the forged prescription, but the
drug clerk had been unable to give any
positive information . as to her identity
until after he had been recalled by the
prosecution and was unable to positively
fix the date of the presentation of the
prescription until he had been given an
opportunity to .consult the prescription
book.
Attorney Drury scored the evidence of
Handwriting Expert Eisenschtmmel and
eald that even if the evidence of Drug
Clerk Peterson and Expert Eisenschimmel
were true no evidence had been produced
by the prosecution to connect the ac
cused women with the crime of murder-
Ing Martin L. Bowers by administering
arsenic. For that reason Drury asked for
a dismissal. ,
BYINGTON MAKES REPLY.
District Attorney Byington replied for
the prosecution and said that the only
way for a Judge or Jury to decide was
from the surrounding circumstances in a
case. He argued that the evidence pre
sented could not bring a reasonable
thinking person to any conclusion but
the one that the defendants were guilty
as charged. Attorney Byington went over
the evidence as presented and claimed
that Martin L. Bowers met his death by
arsenical poisoning and that the drug
was administered by his wife, Mrs. Mar
tha E. Bowers, and that her sister, Mrs.
Sutton, was a party to the crime; that
she had purchased the drug well knowing
for what purpose it was Intended. Bying
ton asked that both women.be held for
trial in the Superior Court.
Attorney H. Mclsaacs also addressed
the court on behalf of the defendants
following the same theme of argument as
outlined by his associate, Attorney Frank
Drury.

The evidence of the autopsy surgeon and of
the city chemist is that the death of Bowers
wÂ«t3 due to tatty degeneration of the kidneyt,.
which might have been caused by arsenical pol
eoningr or by other means. The evidence tur
tner shows that Bowers was treated for pto
maine poisoning, which is similar to arsenical
poisoning. He was taken to the Waldeck Hos
pital and under the treatment given to him
there he Improved. In that the stomach symp
toms disappeared. Und*r the same treatment
at his home, where he was removed at the re
quest or his wife, he became worse. Again I
say the cause of his death is beyond dispute.
The next question Is who was responsible for
his death. According to the evidence, the in
ference is that no person other than his wife
could have been constantly in attendance at the
sick bed and administer the doses of arsÂ»nlc
that eventually resulted In death. These facts
are of the utmest importance and warrant a
mâ¢ VJ.Sh S^ pe^ or Court of thIa defendant.
Mrs. Martha t Bowers. Added to this is the
evidence of the drug clerk as to the forged pre
scription and the admitted examples of Mrs

sion that Mrs. Bowers wrote the forjred pre

coupled with the fact that Mrs. Bowers was

sufficient to make it my duty to hold Mrs

Basso solos "The Memory of the Dead"
and "Paddies Evermore" were most suc
cessfully given by S. J. Sandy and Paul
Gerson, followed with a "finished and pow
erful reading: of "Emmet's Speech in the
Dock." Mrs. Daisy Keane Gillogley ren
i\3ered. the soprano songs "My Emmet's
No More" and the "Risln* of the Moon"
In a manner that captivated the audience.
Her sweet voice and clear enunciation
gave rare expression to both vocal num
bers. David Manlloyd's true tenor voice
was never more pleasing than when ren
dering the beautiful vocal number, "Oh,
Breathe Not His Name." and the efcer
popular "Sean Bean Bocht." Miss Nora
Sandy gave a plaintive and sweetly me
lodious rendering of a Gaelic song, for
which she received a hearty and well de
served encore. The exercises terminated
with a eulogy on Robert Emmet by Rev.
P. C. Yorke and the singing of Save
Ireland."
Miss Nora Sandy acted as accompanist
and admirably she filled the offlce.

Finally, through the private line of the
Police Department, the Central Emergen
cy Hospital was reached, and then came
another wait, that department trying to
communicate with the Park Hospital,
which is much nearer to the original call.
The Central ambulance was at last dis
patched, after an enforced loss of valua
ble time. The woman, when she was
brought in. was in a very weak condition,
and Dr. Boskowitz, after treating- her,
ordered that she be kept at the hospital
for the nizht.
In all, some 150 wires were cut, and the
force of workmen will be occupied until
to-morrow In completing repairs.
Bonn miscreant entered the sub-base
ment of the New City Hair some time be
tween 2 and 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon
and cut three telephone cables that car
ried most of the lines that make up the
entire hall system.
The person who committed the dastard
ly deed was one who is evidently well ac
qalnted with the working of the system.
Entrance was gained, through a heavily
ironed door on the Larkln-street corridor
and within a few feet of the City Hall
police station.
The miscreant had to gTope his way
through the dark basement for quite a
distance in order to get to the switch
board. Once there he easily accomplished
his purpose and rendered useless nearly
every line in the hall. Â« Â¦
The wrecking of the system came near
resulting in a fatality. LJzzie Hedger
eon, a domestic employed at 1738 Golden
Gate avenue, was seized with a hemor
rhage while at work yesterday afternoon
and was relieved by a physician of the
neighborhood. Soon after another and
more severe hemorrhage came on and it
was decided to send her to the Park
Emergency Hospital. For an hour the
woman lay bleeding, and almo3t died
while her helpers were trying to make
connections with the hospital.

BAKERSFIELD, Sept. 21. â William

Standard Oil Company, died in this city
late last night of cerebral spinal men

and had been with the Standard Oil Com
pany for many years In an official ca

The Supreme' Court yesterday granted
the appeal of Anthony Quill for a new
trial of a suit against the Southern Pa
cific Railroad. The plaintiff had a daugh
ter killed through the alleged negligence
of an employe of the corporation. The
Jury in the Superior Court decided against
him and an appeal was taken on the
ground that Jurors Farquharson and
Dorland were prejudiced. Before these
two men were reached all the peremptory
challenges had been exhausted. The Su
preme Court thinks the point a good one
and' the decision of the lower tribunal is
reversed. >
Decides Against Railroad.
OFFICIALS of the army and of the navy have
designated "The Star-Spangled Banner" as
the national anthem of the United States, and
it is quite probable the people will follow the lead thus
given. It is becoming the practice, moreover, for
audiences to rise and to stand uncovered while trie
air is played. These things come in response to what
is evidently a popular aspiration, and accordingly
they are to be commended, since they stand as evi
dences of the increasing ardor of American pa
triotism.
Conceding everything that can be urged in favor
of the air chosen as our. national anthem and of the
practice of standing uncovered whenever it is played,
there remain certain serious objections to the whole
thing. In the first place standing for a long time un
covered in the open air is one of the formal outward
evidences of respect that might just as well be dis
pensed with even under circumstances where it has
hitherto prevailed, and it would be almost a folly to
carry it further by establishing a new occasion for it.
Many an American has stood uncovered by the graves
of a friend while a long ritual service was being, car
ried out, only to go home with a cold or a pneu
monia that brought him ere long to the graveyard
also. Physicians have time and again given warn
ings of the dangers of the custom, and no single
reason can be given why it should be continued at
funerals, much less extended to all occasions where
a band plays the "Star-Spangled Banner." Ample
respect can be shown by rising, lifting the hat for a
OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.
The Committee on Finance, Health and Streets of
the Board of Supervisors have met in solemn dignity
and with much resounding phrase have asked the
Board of Health and the Board of Public Works to
rescind the action by which these worthy public bu
reaus have defeated the law and made a new raid
upon the treasury in increased salaries. The absurd
ity of the request makes it worthy of public interest
and tecord.
NAPA, Sept. 21.â Sheriff Dunlap went
to Napa Junction to-day and returned
with Jack Hall, a section hand, and C.
P. Henry employed at Inkleman's Hotel.
It is charged by Inkleman that the two
men robbed John Copplnger, a section
hand, of a large sum of money while the
latter was helplessly Intoxicated. Inkle
man recovered the money. The two men
were taken before Justice McKnight, who
placed their bail at $1500 each and set the
examination for Tuesday.

ers asainst the Universal Tobacco Com
pany. This stay prohlous the examina
tion of the tobacco company's books pend
ing an appeal to the Court of Errors and

cellor Pitney. The Vice Chancellor made

connection with the suit brought by Mc-
Alpln and others charclnsr mismanage
ment and asking for the dissolution of
the voting trust under which William H.
Butler, president of the company, domi
nated the company's policy. The matter
now goes to the Court of Errors and Ap
peals for final adjudication. Â«
BIG TOBACCO COMPANY

Even the Chinese are progressive in the arts
which distinguish them. Their highbinders in this
city, surfeited no doubt by their murder of resident
Mongols, threaten to assassinate any white attorney
who has temerity enough to defend in court a coolie
against whom their wrath is raised. This effort to
broaden the field of their murderous activity is likely
to be dangerous. \ As Jong as their murders were
confined to Chinese each assassination meant one
coolie less. The killing of one white man might rid
us of Little China.
NAPA, Sept. 21.â The Board of Super
visors of Napa County to-day held a

New York Advertising Agent Files
Complaint Against a Bill Post
ing Association.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â Sam" W. Hoke,
an advertisine and poster agent of tha ,
city, to-day filed a complaint In tha
United States Circuit Court against the
Associated BUI Posters and Distributers
of the United States and Canada, in
which he claims $60,000 damages from
them on the ground that the association
is an illegal trust and combination, ope
rating in violation of the Federal anti
trust law. The Associated Bill Posters
are being sued through A. B. Beall of
Sioux City^ Iowa, the treasurer, who is
also made an individual defendant.
Hoke charges that the Associated Bill
Posters and Distributers of the United
States and Canada constitute a volun
tary association that is operating in vio
lation of interstate and foreign commerca
in the form of advertising conducted by
means of the posting of advertising bills
on fences and other places throughout the
country, engaged in arbitrarily fixing
minimum rates to be charged for bill post- â¢

AWE INSPIRING SPECTACLE
IS PREPARED FOR CHICAGO
As the industries as well as the commerce of the
country are to a considerable -degree affected by the
degree of efficiency that exists in the consular ser
vice, it is expected that all organizations represent
ing industry and commerce will co-operate with the
league in the effort to bring about the desired legis
lation. The co-operation should be prompt as well
as cordial. The Lodge bill should be enacted at the
coming session of Congress. Wj
One of the most active and influential of the
many organizations that have declared for reform
and have worked to bring it about is the National
Business League, a non-partisan body, composed of
representative men of commerce and industry in every
State in the Union. It has given special attention
to the subject and has carried on an extensive cam
paign of education in favor of the message of reform
embodied in the Lodge bill, which contemplates a
complete reorganization of the consular service, sub
stituting fixed salaries in place of the fees system, pro
viding for the adoption of the merit system in mak
ing promotions, and, in short, removing the service
altogether from the spoils of politics.
Should the bill become law it would not be long
before there would be an immense improvement in
the pcrsor^sel of the service and a corresponding
improvement in the service itself. We should no
longer have important consular positions filled by
men absolutely without qualification, and who owe
their appointments solely to their activity as parti
san politicians in their various Congressional dis
tricts.. The bill provides that an appointee must have
a general knowledge of the trade conditions, re
sources and requirements of this country, as well as
the country to which he is accredited; also must speak
fluently either the French, German or Spanish lan
gnage, as well as English, and in every other way be
qualified to serve and promote the manufacturiqg
and commercial interests of the United States. â¢
The passage of the bill is not going to be easily
effected, even though it have the support of the Presi
dent. That much is evident f^ora the defeat of the
many efforts that have been made in times past to
bring about reform. As a matter of fact the bill vir
tually asks the Senators to surrender a large part of
their official patronage, and to a great many of them
patronage is the most valuable adjunct of a Sena
torial position. They would almost as soon resign
the one as surrender the other. The hopes of the
friends of the measure rest partly upon the support
of those Senators who arc true statesmen and
patriots, and partly upon the power of public opinion
to control the vote of the spoilsmen.
It is for the purpose of working up a strong sen
timent in favor of reform that the National Business
League is now carrying on its campaign. A recent
summary of the prospects of the league in this re
spect says: "The hope of success for this effort to
induce Senators and Representatives to give up so
handsome a block of patronage lies in the fact that
the men behind the movement are not doctrinaires or
theoretical reformers, but practical business men,
heads of great manufacturing and mercantile con
cerns, bankers, importers, exporters, presidents of
boards of trade, chambers of commerce and grain ex
changes. They are men practically familiar not only
v.itb the needs of trade, but with the business of a
consular officer, and are not to be deceived as to the
proper qualifications for such a position or the proper
discharge of its duties. Their demand for sweeping
reorganization in the service is born of bitter expe
rience with its present inadequacy, incompetency and
ignorance, and they, represent sufficient material in
terests to insure them a hearing even from the most
stupid and selfish patronage broker in either house."
i he forces that have been for so long a time work
ing to bring about the enactment of a consular re
form bill have not lessened their activities because of
the President's action in recent appointments. On
the contrary, they have drawn encouragerqent from
this manifestation of the President's sympathy with
the movement for reform, and will urge upon Con
gress the passage of an efficient consular reform bill
with increased zeal.
\ \ J H1LE President Roosevelt's determination
\/\/ to fill important vacancies in the consular
â¢ â¢ service by promotion of capable men from
subordinate positions is a source of gratification to
fell who take any interest in the matter, it is by no
means sufficient to assure the thorough reform that
lias been long needed. There is required a change in
the law regulating appointments, so that the reform
methods of selecting men for the various offices shall
become a fixed feature of our administrative system.

Such a report coming after something like 'two
months of continuous running across the channel in
all kinds of weather seems to justify the conclusion
that the turbine engine has been virtually perfected
and another great step made toward turning all
ocean voyaging into something like a ferry service.
The chief defect of the turbine engines when first
tested v.-as the inability of getting up any speed
astern with them. In any kind of a steamer it is de
sirable to have the power of going astern at times,
and in ferry-boats the desire is to have ability to go
ahead or astern with equal facility. It now appears
that the inventor of the turbine has so far improved
his engine- that a ship can be driven astern with some
thing like the speed ahead. It is reported of the
Queen that on her trial trip on the Clyde, on the 12th
of June, when steaming continuously astern,, she at
tained a speed of about thirteen knots. Starting and
stopping trials were also carried out, and the vessel
when going over nineteen knots per hour was
brought to a dead stop in 1 minute 7 seconds after
the telegraph order was given to the engine-room,
and the distance she traveled in this time was equal
to only two and a half times her own length.
The Queen has three cylinders, three shafts and
three screws, the center turbine being high pressure
and the others low pressure. When going ahead in
ordinary work the steam is admitted to the high
pressure turbine, and after expansion there passes to
the low-pressures and then to the condensers, the
total ratio of expansion being about one hundred
and twenty-five fold, as compared with eight to six
teen fold in triple expansion reciprocating engines.
When going full speed ahead all the lines of shafting,
central as well as side, are in action; but when com
ing alongside a quay or maneuvering in or out of
harbor the outer shafts only are used, thus giving
the vessel all the turning and maneuvering, efficiency
of a twin-screw steamer.
In commenting upon that feature of the new ship
the Consul says: "The noise made by these turbine
engines is unlike the common engine. They^ake a
rumbling noise like rapid-running dynamos. Even
in their immediate vicinity there'is little or no vibra
tion, but one is conscious of being in close proximity
to a great power. From amidships forward on the
promenade decks there is no noise or vibration what
ever, and when the vessel is making twenty-three
knots per hour in good weather passengers are re
minded of being on shipboard only by noting that
they are gliding over the sea. . * * * One note
worthy feature on board the Queen will be the ab
sence of the hot cinders and dust, which are â and
more especially to ladies â such a nuisance on board
most steamers fitted with forced draft."
REPORTS received at Washington from
United States Consul Milne at Calais are
to the effect that the continuous running of
the steamer Queen equipped with turbine engines
across the channel has realized the most sanguine
expectations aroused by the performance of her trial
trip. In good weather she makes the trip from
Dover to Calais in fifty minutes, beating the swiftest
of her rivals by upward of fifteen minutes. She has
other advantages as a ferry-boat, for she is freer
from noise and from jarring than are boats of a sim
ilar tonnage driven by the old form of engine.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 21.â
The circular letter issued from the presi
dent's office a few days ago requiring
all members of the defunct Inn Club to
pay a pro rata assessment of $10 by the
25th inst., or have their registration in
the university canceled, was to-day re
scinded by President Jordan. ill.
According to the law, the members of
the club are responsible for only 51000 of
the deficit, and as they have agreed to
raise this amount on their own account
the university authorities have extended
the time for this purpose. The pro rata
assessment will now not exceed $5 40, and
in case the property of the club can be
sold for J300 the assessment will be re
duced to WTO. For the J1500 balance of
the deficit the directors Â«f the organiza
tion are alone liable.
An attempt is now being made to have
an outside party take hold of the Inn.
but unless this is accomplished by the
end of the present week the eating-house
will be closed and the 150 students who
are now taking meals there will be forced
to find boarding accommodations off the
university campus.
San Francisco has a treat In store In
an entertainment to be given at Y. M. C.
A. Hall September 26 for the benefit of
the Chinese Woman's Hospital. The pro
gramme is to be rendered by leading pro
fessionals, assisted by Or'ental artists in
native costume. It Is to be the first en
tertainment of its kind ever given In
America. The hall is to be decorated in
Oriental style and a Chinese orchestra
will furnish music. Another very inter
esting feature will be a Chinese ladies'
quartet. Mr. CheÂ« Soo Lowe; who is at
tending the University of California, Is
to sing a solo, accompanied by. Miss
Ah Tie. Mr. Lowe has won many friends
by his sweet, sympathetic voice. Miss
Suey Leen, a young Chinese lady who
has studied voice culture for some time,
will also give a vocal selection. Suey
Leen has made numerous trips to differ
ent pa'rts of the State to sing before Â£Re
public She has always been greeted
with great enthusiasm on account of her
clear high notes. The real Chinese music,
as furnished by the best professionals, is
something that is not .heard every day.
The great musicians of Europe are mak
ing a careful study into the science of
Chinese music and are finding many in
teresting and instructive points regarding
the art of music.
The quartet before mentioned, com
posed of Qua Lou, Ah Tie and Margaret
and Ah Ching, is well known In this city,
the young ladies having sung before large
audiences In the public institutions.
Among the professionals who are to ren
der the programme are Miss Jenne Mar
row Long, Professor Adelstein and others
well known in concert work. The vocal
ist of the evening, Walter Hastings Ol
ney, is new to San Francisco audiences,
having recently come to this city. Mr.
Olney has studied under the best masters
and his rich barytone voice shows the
polish of a true artist.
"Robert Browning- In Music" was pre
sented by the San Francisco Musical Club
at Century Hall last Thursday morning.
The programme opened with three
Browning songs composed by the Mi?ses
Caroline Fuller and Clara Rogers; these
were rendered with much pathos and
sympathy by Miss Ella McCloskey, the
contralto, whose personality and voice
seemed especially adapted to the text and
melody. Readings were given by Mrs.
James W. Edwards, after which Miss
Frances Rock delighted the club with her
rendition of Bach'a Fugue in D minor
and other selections.
The programme was one of high stand
ard and bespeaks much for the musical

It must be admitted that Mr. Gompers has inspired
his confederated unions with the courage of his con
victions. They are now fearlessly attacking the laws
of the United States and threatening the President for
enforcing them. So far every considerable conven
ticle of labor unions held during the summer has de
clared for the sovereign right of the unions to dic
tate the terms of employment in the Government
printing office, book bindery and bureau of engraving
and printing. The terms they dictate violate the laws
of the land, and as those laws conform to the con
stitution the unions are striking at the fundamental
law. President Roosevelt, as his oath and duty re
quire, has upheld and enforced the law, and for this
they threaten him with vengeance. Having shown
their power to disorganize the National Guard and to
leave a single State powerless to enforce the law, they
now aim their vengeance at the President himself.
There is no use denying the fact that this contest puts
our institutions to a new test and subjects them to a
new 'strain, in some of its aspects more serious than
secession itself. The talk of the last few years, sup
posed to be wild and empty, has been accepted as the
teaching of a principle and has impressed the vast
numbers of alien immigrants who have recruited the
ranks of union labor to the exclusion of Americans,
and now the conflict rages around the Federal Gov
ernment and the President is threatened because he
represents the sovereignty of the United States and
the supremacy of the law.
The issue is serious; it is revolutionary; it is sub
versive of all law. It is to be carried, secretly or
openly, into the next Presidential campaign, and may
easily cause all other issues to be forgotten. If the
people .of this country tolerate another sovereignty
than that of the State, then anarchy is here.
IT is evident that the American Federation of La
bor is giving impulse to a campaign which is
operated on several converging lines. Members
of the federation in Porto Rico are spreading sedi
tion among the very ignorant members of the labor
unions in that island, and have gone so far as to de
nounce the flag of the United States as the emblem of
rascality, and to threaten the life of Governor Hunt.
On the mainland the movement is more cautious,
though in the same direction.
Here the laws of the unions and the laws of the
land conflict in respect to membership in the National
Guard. Federal and State laws recognize the militia
organized in the National Guard as the defensive arm
of the Government and the training school of the
military rank and file. 'In times of civil disorder,
when the peace ofricers and the courts are confronted
by a physical force obstructive of their functions, the
militia is the sole resource of the State for protection
against that actual anarchy which exists when the
civil courts can no longer enforce the law. The next
resort is to Federal authority enforced by the regu
lar army of the United States. The unions in the
American Federation strike at the nearest support of
law and order by striking at the militia. During the
past few months National Guardsmen, and some of
them officers, have been compelled by their unions to
resign. They have given their reason that if they
remain in the guard they will be expelled from the
union, and then if they attempt to work they will be
killed. It will be seen at once that this is the use of
duress of the most serious kind in order to break
down the first defense of the law. It is in effect
threatening with assassination every man who holds
the law of his country to be higher than the laws of
his labor union. The extravagant assumptions with
which the country has been made familiar and at
which good citizens have laughed as mere vaporing
of ignorant enthusiasts have borne fruit. When Mr.
Gompers, president of the American Federation of
Labor, declared here, in the presence, and the ap
proving presence, too, of the Mayor of this city and
the Governor of this State, that his organization had
"sovereign rights," law-abiding citizens believed that
he was using terms in ignorance of their meaning,
since here only the State has sovereignty and sov
ereign rights. But Mr. Gompers was not using a
term in ignorance of its significance. He knew and
meant exactly what he said, that his organization had
taken, in the allegiance of its members, the place of
the State, and they knew no other sovereignty than
that represented by him. Again at New Orleans Mr.
Gompers gave evidence of his sense of the importance
of his position and authority when he said, with his
sovereign character in mind: "Our most dangerous
competitor is the Federal Government." He un
doubtedly meant that his federation of labor unions
was strong enough in its sovereignty to subvert a
single State, or to overcome, one by one, a group of
States, inasmuch as one State cannot go to the aid
of another except as it operates through Federal
energy. But after that he would find the Federal
Government with the regular army making a stand
for public sovereignty as against the claims of vol
untary organizations bound by secret oaths.

The "Star-Spangled Banner" will be accepted as

OPENS PRESENT WEEK
Mr. Taylor will ppend only one day In
this city. On Thursday h# will start back
for St, Louis. He wlll^robably be ac
companied to St. Louis'by Commissioner
Filcher. The bids of contractors for the
erection of the California building on the
exposition grounds have been called for,
and they will probably be received by the
time that Commissioner Filcher shall ar
rive in St. Louis. At once after the con
tract is awarded the work of construct
ing the California building will begin.
Incidentally other matter? concerning
California and its relations to the exposi
tion may be taken up. Mr. Taylor has
!>.-Â»>n at Ogrden. ar.d also visited Xevada
on Invitation of Mr. Yerrinpton, the Ex
position Commissioner for Nevada. While
be was in Nevada l.e was invited by the
California Commissioners to come to Cal
ifornia to get into closer touch with this
Ptate.
F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the
departments of horticulture and agricul
ture at the St. Louis Exposition, will be
here to-morrow to confer with the Cali
fornia Commissioners to the exposition,
Messrs. Filcher and Wiggins. California
has 40,000 square feet of space already se
cured in the agricultural and horticultural
building at the big show. This has been
found to be insufficient, and a request
has been made for the allotment of sev
oral thousand more square feet In the
fime building. In this structure will be
the great collective exhibit representative
Â«{ California. When Mr. Taylor gets here
to-morrow he will probably go into the
kubject of more space and the reasons ad
duced for the request for supplemental
loom.
Dexter was called to the stand and ad
mitted that he had been at times a little
bit harsh to his wife.
"I had to reprimand her several times
because of her conduct with Spinney. He
had money and came between my wife
and me. Why, on one occasion, a little
more than a year ago, I bought an oyster
omelette at the request of my wife. I
had twelve oysters put in that omelette,
and expected to share In it, but she gave
my share to Spinney. In fact she gave
him the whole thing, even refusing to
give me one oyster."
A divorce was granted to W. J. Dicker
son from Hazel Dickerson for desertion
and Blanche Crowther* from Andrew F.
Crowther for neglect. Suits for divorce
were tiled by Rosa Viola. Vassels against
George R. Vassels for desertion, Sarah
Schultz against Samuel Schultz for
cruelty and Amelia McMinn against Jo
seph McMinn for neglect.
The divorce euit of L.ibbie Dexter
against Charles Dexter, gambler, was
heard by Judge Troutt yesterday and
taken under submission. Mrs. Dexter
wants a divorce on the ground of extreme
cruelty, claiming that her husband made
her life unhappy by accusing her of being
too friendly with one Joseph Spinney.
She said that he was so jealous of Spin
ney that he once struck her. after a quar
rel that was caused by a discussion over
Spinney's standing In the family.
There is a chance that the matrimonial
difficulties of Wllhelmlna Gelhaus and
Frank Gelhaus may be settled without the
interference of the divorce court. It is
a Bllm chance, to be sure, but Judge Gra
ham has determined that it is worth the
risking, and because he thinks so he
made an order yesterday directing the
entire Gelhaus family, father, mother and
ten children, to appear before him next
Friday so that he can hear a little more
of the difficulties that beset the path of
the plaintiff and defendant, and if needs
be, send them home to patch them up.
The case came up for hearing before
Judge Graham yesterday, and his decis
ion was arrived at after he had heard the
tale of woe told by Mrs. Gelhaus.
Gelhaus Is a coal dealer, with a yard on
Fourteenth 6treet, between Mission and
Market. Some three months ago his wife
sued him for divorce on the ground of
cruelty. He answered, denying her
charges, and in a cross complaint he ac
cused her of being the cruel one. When
Mrs. Gelhaus took the witness stand yes
terday, it became very evident that the
action for divorce was simply the result
of a quarrel that had been preceded by
many others, and which happened to be
a little bit more trying than the ones that
occurred during the first few months of
their married life. She testified that she
had been married to Gelhaus for ten
years and that during that time she had
borne him seven children, in addition to
caring for the three children that were
his by a former marriage. She said that
he had slapped her a few times during
their married life, and had also said many
unkind things to her. She said that other
wise Gelhaus was a good husband. He
frequently did her washing for her and
helped her with her household duties.
Her actions in court showed that she was
a little bit overwrought, ana, Judge Gra-.
ham told her attorney that a little rest
would do her some good, and he put the
case over for a few weeks, asking Mrs.
Gelhaus to appear before him next Friday
with all her children, even to the little
one torn to her after she had instituted
the divorce proceedings, u
Ordinances were passed to print provid

ic and Tr^mont avenues and on Java

Replying to the Mayor's statement,
Brandenstein said that the vetoes of the
Mayor did not affect the action of the
Health Board and Board of Works in
raising salaries. The two boards, he con
tinued, had used moneys specifically ap
propriated for new positions and for oth
er purposes for the sole purposes of in
creasing salaries, to which the committee
had taken exception.
BRANDENSTEIN REPLIES.
Mayor Schmltz expressed his pleasure
at the presentation of the report, and said
that he was sorry the Supervisors were
not of the same opinion when he had by
veto reduced the appropriation of the two
boards named, which, however, the board
had overruled.
Your committee further reports that Its in
vestigation developed the fact that certain
salaries that were set aside for additional
employes of the Health Department, upon the
recommendation of that department at the
time of the consideration of the budget, had
not been devoted to that purpose by the Board
of Health but had been applied by It to the
payment of the Increased salaries before men
tioned. - . , . . .
Your committee regrets that this board has
not the power to repeal the acts of these two
departments which are in defiance of the rec
ommendations of the budget, and that this
board should be confined to a recommendation
and request to those departments to rescind
their action and abide by the provisions of
the budget and to make such increases and
only such increases in salaries and wages as
arfc Specifically authorized and provided for in
the budget.
SAXARIES ARE JUGGLED.
The joint Committee on Finance,** Hospital
and Health, and Streets. Sewers and Parks,
respectfully reports to this board that after *
careful, detailed investigation of the actions
of the Board of Public Works and the Board
of Health In increasing the salaries of cer
tain employes of those boards In excess of
the provisions of the budget therefor it is not
satisfied tvith tho6e actions. The appropria
tions made in the budget of this fiscal year
to cover the needs of these two departments
were determined upon only after an ex
haustive examination of the actual needs of
those departments. The subsequent investi
gation by the committee only confirmed the
correctness of those appropriations. While the
committee recognizes that under the charter
these departments may have control of the
amount of compensation to be paid to their
employes, nevertheless, as the Board of Su
pervisors has the ultimate responsibility of the
financial affairs - of the city, and in order to
make the proper appropriations for the various
departments of government, must determine
upon a basis of compensation for the various
employes of ail the departments, its implied
or expressed recommendations In the budget
should be respected by the various departments
unless good cause is shown to the contrary.
Your committee reports that in its judgment
no cause was shown why the recommenda
tions of the budget were ignored by these de
partments.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopteu the report submitted by the joint
Committee on Finance, Health and Streets
in which the Health Board and Board of
Public Works are taken to task for in

which were not provided for by the mu
nicipal budget. The report follows:

TWO BOARDS ARE
TAKEN TO TASK
TAYLOR COMING
FOR CONFERENCE
Inasmuch as the valuation of the Assessor,
if this is a county, is subject to equalization
by the State Board, tlrere is some foundation,
under the decisions ot Â»ur Supreme Court, as
to the nature of the city and county of ban
Francisco for the contention that the valuation
as fixed by the State Hoard of Equalization
must be accepted by .the city and county of
San Francisco for all purposes. 1 do not my
self hold to this theory. I believe that It ia
possible to entirety disassociate the valua
tion as fixed by the Assessor and the Board
of Supervisors for municipal purposes from
that which is eventually fixed by the State
Board of Equalization for State purposes, it
may be the ultimate conclusion of our courts
that we have power within our charter to
adopt an assessment made by a count;- officer
as the basis for a municipal tax levy.
I give little weight to the language that is
found in the decision of the Supreme vCOurt
(Baldwin vs Ellis. CS Cal. 49o). upholding the
contention that there can be but one valua
tion of the property within the State The
facts there presented do not raise that ques
tion as to a separate and different valuation
within a municipality for municipal purposes
and the language of the commissioner is so
general and loose as to be of little authority.
It is a matter of common knowledge that in
many of the cities in this State there is one
valuation fixed for municipal Purposes and
another valuation fixed by the County Asses
sor for cdunty and State purposes. The the
ory of our constitution is that the munici
pality shall be Independent of the State so
far as purely local revenues are concerned.
ADVISES LOWER BATE.
I advise that at the next meeting, viz.: the
third Monday In September, you fix a tax .rate
for municipal purposes in conformity with the
provisions of the Political Code and based
upon the valuation made by the State Board
of Equalization. The rate so fixed should be
approximately 30 per cent lower than the rate
fixed in June and should be sufficient, and
only sufficient, to produce the same revenue
as would be produced by the June rate based
upon the Assessor's valuation. In the or
dinance fixing such municipal rate no refer
ence whatever should be made to the June
rate so that the point could not be made
[hat' there was a direct repeal of the previous
levy It is understood that the Auditor shall
at once proceed to act upon the assumption
that the September rate as fixed by you is
valid Proceedings in mandamus will then be
brought in the Supreme Court by a tax
payer to compel him to act in accordance with
*ho limn levy and in this proceeding I hope
tor 1 determination of the whole question
within a short period and before taxes become
dplinouent By this procedure, no matter
what the determination of the court as to the
Tat e that is valid, the taxpayer will be called
upon to pay only the amount of municipal
tax?s that ho would have been called upon to
Pay had the State board not raised the valua
tion fixed by the Assessor.
ASSESSOR'S VALUATION.
If we accept the rate as fixed in June, which
Is $1,070, and accept the valuation upon the
property â¢within this municipality as fixed by
the State Board of Equalization, we will raise
by taxation an amount approximately $1,300,
000 more than has been provided for by the
budget. It is the law as eet forth in the
charter and sustained by the courts that no
expenditure can be made by the city and
county for municipal purposes, excepting in
conformity wlttu the budget appropriation. The
effect of permitting the tax rate of June to
stand and levying the same upon the valua
tion as fixed by the State Board of Equaliza
tion would be to increase the revenues of
the city without permitting any possible ex
penditure of the same during the fiscal year in
which it is raised.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print an ordinance declaring the
tax rate for the. next fiscal year, both for
State and city purposes, to be $1-405 on
every $100 assessed valuation. The State
tax levy is 56.1 cents, and that for the city
is fixed at 84.4 cents, the latter rate being
adopted on recommendation of the City
Attorney to meet the raise ordered by the
State Board of Equalization In order not
to collect the sum of ?1,300,000' under the
rate of $1,076 adopted in June In excess of
the appropriations made in the municipal
budget. The total assessment roll, includ
ing the raise of $118,213,676 made by the
Board of Equalization, Is $545,855,324. The
tabulated statement of the new tax rate

CITY ATTORNEY'S OPINION.
City Attorney Lane rendered an opinion
In answer to the question touching the
raising of the assessment roll of the city
and county of San Francisco by the State
Board of Equalization and the effect suc"h
raise has upon the rate of taxation for i
city and county purposes, as fixed by the
Board of Supervisors the last Monday in
June. The opinion says:
I suggest the advisability of presenting the
questions flowing out of the action of the
State Hoard of Equalization to the Supremo
Court for final and authoritative Judicial de
termination. Pending this decision. I advise
that the Hoard of Supervisors, at its next
meeting, fix a new and lower 'rate of taxa
tion for city and county purpoees. based upon
the incn-aced valuations established by the
State Board of Equalization.
The State Hoard of Equalization increased
the assessment roll of the city and county of
San Francisco by raising the same SO per cent,
thereby adding to the valuation of the prop
erty within the city and county by the amount
of over ?li>O.OC0,WO.

The petition was referred to the Street
Committee and Is supplementary' to a pre
vious application of the same company
for a franchise over a number of streets
in the vicinity of Sixteenth street, which
is now in the hands of the City Engineer.
When the franchise for a bay shore line
to the Southern Pacific Company was un
der consideration strong protests were
made against giving the company practi
cal control of Sixteenth street, to the ex
clusion of teaming traffic.
Your petitioner is a transcontinental rail
road and it desires to enter the city of San
Francisco with its road and run Its Cars to the
Wflter front at the most suitable points for
rublic convenience. That the ordinance grant
ing such right shrill be upon the conditions that
this company shall have and keep in repair the
streets along said route from curb to curb In
such manner as may be prescribed by the Su
ptrvisors. This company further expresses its
willingness to comply with the charter and the
State laws. The permit for which the fran
chise Is desired 1b forty-nine years.
That said line of railroad has been located
so as to be most compatible with the public
good and the least private injury. That your
petitioner is ready to begrln the construction
of said line as soon as permission is granted
by the Board of Supervisors.
The "Western Pacific Railway Company

of Supervisors requesting Â«<hat it be

Bernard Altheer, the young chicken
rancher, whose disappearance from his
place at Petaluma was noticed in Sun
day's Call, returned to the home of his
parents at 1261 Webster street yesterday
morning. At the time of his sudden dis
appearance from the Petaluma chicken
ranch he had quite a sum of money on
his person, and his non-arrival at his city
home aroused the suspicion of his rela
tives that he might have met with foul
play. Such, however, was not the case,
as when he reported at his home he had
all his property intact. The only strange
feature of his disappearance is that he
claims to have lost all recollection of how
or where he spent the twenty-four hours
of his time that is unaccounted for.

TROOPER DAVIS FINISHES
FIRST IN THE TEST RIDE
Covers the Distance From Oklahoma
to West Point in Thirty-
Nine Days.
NEWBURG, N. Y., Sept 21.â Trooper
Davis of the Eighth United States Cav
alry has reached West Point, being the
first of a detachment of twelve troopers
who started from Oklahoma thirty-nine
days ago on a test ride of 2000 miles. ThÂ£
men were allowed to eat and sleep when
they pleased, relays of horses being pro
vided every thirty miles, the object of thÂ»
ride being to cover the distance In the
shortest possible time.
Davis, being the lightest man of the
party, led his comrades. at the start and
thus had the advantage of getting tha
pick of mounts at the relay stations. He
rode up the east bank of the Hudson as
far .as Garrison, where his horse gave out.
The ferry having stopped running, he re
ported his arrival by signaling across the
river to West Point. Then he came on to
this city, thence proceeded to his destina
tion. Davis weighed 137 pounds when he
started and now weighs but 108 pounds.
He was very tired, but happy to think ha
had broken the record for the distar.cn,
which is forty-five days. The ride is onÂ»
of several taken to test the stamina of
men and horses, made at the suggestion
of General Young, the new chief of staff.

he disposed of in exchange for cigars and
meals. The stamps taken off the pack
ages he sold at half price, but only in
small Quantities in each place.
The prisoner has been a criminal all
his life. He was committed to the San

of stealing books and received a sentence
of six months. His latest conviction was
one of six months for stealing brass signs
from doorways. He was released on Au
gust 31 and on September 1 he began rob
bing the mails.

habeas corpus proceedings in the District
Court to-day In the cases of military
prisoners in confinement at Camp Golden
had all the spectacular settings of mili
tary display. At the morning session
Judge Seeds absolutely refused to listen
to any argument In the i^jsence of the
prisoners and an adjournment was taken
nzttU 2 p. m. Previous to that a heavy
guard of troops was placed around the
building containing the courtrooms, and
at 1:30 the four prisoners for whom writs
had been issued were brought in under
guard.
When court convened Lieutenant Mc-
Clelland read a supplementary return to
the writ of habeas corpus. In this he
claimed the first jurisdiction of the Dis
trict Court over the military prisoners,
saying that General Chase wa3 in full au
thority, by virtue of the executive order
of Governor Peabody and had absolute
authority in the situation by the right
which Governor Peabody gave him when
he ordered the troops to the district.
Attorneys for the prisoner related the
substance of their petition. Attorney Mur
phy said the four prisoners held were
citizens of the United States and were
being illegally detained without warrant.
Lieutenant McClelland, acting advocate
general, replied. He read from the Penn
sylvania Supreme Court decisions In the
case of Private Wescott, who shot and
killed a striker and was acquitted of; the
charge of murder, saying: "Our eve
rests practically on that Supreme Court
decision."
Attorney Murphy then addressed the
court and cited the decision of the Su
preme Court of Colorado that was handed
down against Governor Walte when he
called troops to the city of Denver to
oust the city officials. The court then
took a recess until to-morrow morning.
The troops returned to Camp Goldfield
with the prisoners.

ple throughout this section of the State
are in terror over the acts of Thomas
Madison, charged with the triple murder
committed in this county last week. Mad
ison has successfully eluded both officers
and bloodhounds thus far, bÂ«t It is
thought that he Is somewhere in the vi
cinity of Cowles, Neb., about fifteen miles
from the Kansas line. Word received here
to-day says Madison Is armed with two
revolvers and plenty of ammunition and
that he had held up a number of people,
threatening to shoot them if they told of
his presence in the country. He entered
a farm house near Cowles and forced the
woman to give him a meal. He has
stolen a team of horses and seems
to be thoroughly. at home in the neigh
borhood. Officers expect to capture
Madison within a few hours, as they say
he has only temporarily eluded them.

Police Officer J. Barrett of the China
town squad had a desperate battle with,
two Chinese and two white men in a
gambling joint in Chinatown last night.
The assailants pinioned the policeman's
wrist between a door and the casing anil
while he was thus handicapped beat him
severely. After releasing himself he final
ly beat the men into submission and ar
rested them, though his wris: was badly
hurt by the door.
Barrett learned that a lottery joint was
running at 604 Jackson street. He went
to the place and on opening the door dis
covered the two Chinese, Lou Kong and
How Wah. and two white men, John
Larsen and Albert Duncan, in the place
marking tickets. He was about to placa
all the party under arrest, when the white
men attacked him and, crowding him. to
the door, succeeded in catching him by
the wrist and holding him there. ThÂ»
officer, almost helpless, fought aa best ha
could, but the two heathens held the door
while Larsen and Duncan administered
the beatinz. Chairs, sticks and fists
rained on the policeman's head, while all
he could do was to kick and struggle to
free himself with one hand.
When Barrett did release himself hÂ»
drew his club and started for the occu
pants of the joint. The four gamblers
continued to fight. Barrett was obliged
to beat them Into submission before they
consented to arrest, and then he brought
them all, manacled, to the City Prison,
where they were locked up.
Manager Alec Greggaina of the San
Francisco Athletic Club has changed his
mind about matching Gus Ruhlln and Joe
Millet for next month. He is now nego
tiating with Jimmy JBritt and "Billy" Sie
ger to battle twenty rounds next month.
Last night "Billy" Britt, who represents
the local lightweight, and "Billy" Roach,
the astute manager and trainer of the
New York boxer, met in Greggains' club
rooms and talked fight. Greggains is will
ing to give the pair a battle and If a
few preliminary arrangements can be
made the card next month will be Britt
and Sieger. This will be a battle well
worth seeing. Sieger recently gave Rufe
Turner, the colored lightweight of Stock
ton, a trouncing In Portland. He has also
fought draws with Joe Gans. Sieger has
a splendid record, and it Is thought he
will be just the man to give Britt a hard
fight.
Special boxlnsr matches will bÂ© held at
the Olympic Club next Thursday evening.
Leader John J. Gleason has arranged a
splendid card. None but members will be
admitted to the club house.

NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â "Jim" Corbett
is ready to make a match with -Bob"
Fitzsimmons at a moment's notice. AH
that is necessary now is Fitzsimmons'
consent to fight, and the match is certain
to be arranged. Corbett reached this city
to-day from Chicago and relieved himself
of that remark immediately on stepping
from the train.
"There's one man I want to meet," he
said, "and that is Fitzsimmons. I will
light him within a year. I would on short
notice, but I want time to get over the
awful beating Jeffries gave me in our
fight last month. For four years I chafed
Fitzsimmons for a fight. I nsver got It.
When he saw me a helplessly beaten man
in the ring after Jeffries got through with
me ho wanted to arrange a match with
me right away. He knew I could stand
little punishment In a bout even six
months later. He figured I would be a
mark for him. That was the only time he
ever expressed a desire to fight me. But
he will be forced to do so and within a
year we will have it out. I am in the
game yet and don't intend to retire until
after I meet Fitzsimmons."

The success of the festival is largely
due to the efforts of Philo Jacoby and
John C. Waller, who had the affair In
charge and took care of the visiting
marksmen from different parts of the
State. Marksmen from outside this city
did very well, especially J. Myer and Ja
cob Gruh'.er of Sacramento and M. Mala
vos of San Jose.
During the afternoon the interest cen
tered on the members' target. This is the
most difficult target on which to make a
high score, as only one entry la allowed.
When, the festival was drawing to a close
and F. E. Mason, F. P. Schuster, Otto
Bremer and other champions had placed
high scores to their credit, the partici
pants were surprised to see Max Ko
la nder,. one of the youngest of marks
men, step in and wrest the trophy away
with the excellent score of 69 rings.
The result of the two days' contest is
that A. Strecker is king, George Risch
muller Sr. is the highest man on. the
honorary target, Max Kolander leads all
the comrades of his club on the members'
target and Frank E. Mason made the best
center of the festival with one of the clos
est bullseyes ever made, being but .50 of
inch from a true center. O. Samuels was
the lucky shot among the press members,
making 65 rings.
The fall festival shooting of the Cali
fornia Schuetzen Club at Schuetzen Park
was one of the most successful ever held
under the auspices of the club. Yesterday
was the final day of the two Gays' con
test and the champions of the rifle had
done excellent work and were anxiously
watching every shot that was fired. The
scores were all very close and as tho
shooting proceeded the interest became
intense. A. Strecker, F, E. Mason, F. P.
Schuster, A. Pape, N. Ahrens and other
participants had all made high scores and
were expected to carry off the laurels of
the day. The astonishment was great
when George Rischmuller stepped in Just
before the targets went down and made
73 rings out of a possible 75, winning from
the next highest Inan by one ring.

Malaria is not confined exclusively to the swamps vV^M.
and marshy regions of the country, but wherever there is Â£$m&l
bad air; this insidious foe to health is found. Poisonous
vapors and gases from sewers, and the musty air of damp
cellars are laden with the germs of this miserable disease, f Sfo 1 1
which are breathed into the lungs and taken up by the llfv^i
biood and transmitted to every part. of the body. Then /t"'tV ; i
you begin to feel out of sorts without ever suspecting the wjÂ« W
cause. No energy or appetite, dull headaches, sleepy and BS1
tired and completely fagged out from the slightest exer- KfjS |j,
tion, are some of the deplorable effects of this enfeebling Hfo|
malady. As the disease progresses and the blood becomes
more deeply poisoned, boils and abscesses and dark or -N
yellow spots appear upon the skin. When the poison is
left to ferment and -the microbes and germs to multiply in \-XN â -
the blood, Liver and Kidney troubles and other serious complications often
arise.* As Malaria begins and develops in the blood, the treatment to be
S-^. effective must, begin there too. S. S. S. destroys

Hambrook was a drummer who came
from San Francisco last winter, while
there selling encyclopedias for a book

he made a desperate attempt to escape
by jumping from a hotel window, but was
later captured in a hay loft.
As the train neared Portland Hambrook
obtained permission to go to the toilet
room and jumped from the small window
feet first. Policeman Carpenter jumped
off the train, and running back along the
track found Hambrook's mangled body
between the rails. His position in sliding
feet first made him fall close to the side

ATT ANCIENT FLASK.
A Cask of a still older type shows fig
ures in black on a red background. The
scene is mythological, showing the Attic
hero Theseus throwing the wild bull of
Marathon. This flask is supposed to
antedate the sepulchral Cask 150 years.
A rare type of drinking cup, such as
was used by * he ancients at banquets, is
e* large as a basin. The cups were made
large In those days because of the prac
tice of diluting the wine with water. Still
the cups contained much more wine than
b. temperate man of these days could or
dinarily stand, even with the water. The
figures on this cup chow a processional
dance of young and old men walking In
regular alternation, the young men with
hands raised and singing. In the center
of this cup, as in almost all others, are
painted a. pair of eyes, which are Intend
ed to charm away the evil spirits.
On another cup of this type is Imprinted
tbe picture of a young man preparing to
throw the remnants of his drinking cup
at a target. This represents a favorite
pastime with the ancients. In which was
required considerable skill to hit the tar
pet, which was always a gong, that
sounded when struck. The archaeologists
have discovered that this game brought
about an immense destruction of cups, as
the practice of throwing .them was uni
versal.
One Cask of white clay, with black lines
The most Interesting relic in the collec
tion Is a well-preserved piece of Egyptian
pre-dynaÂ£tic pottery, which Dr. Emerson
facetiously Bays is older than anybody or
anything in San Francisco to-day. It is a
vessel, big enough to hold a pint, that waÂ«
manufactured in Egypt before the estab
lishment of the first dynasty of native
kings, Trhich carries it back to a time 6000
years before Christ. It is fashioned of
clay and an imitation of stone vessels
previously made, with perforated lugs on
the sides, through which cords for han
dles are passed. There are dark scenes
painted upon a light red background suf
ficiently preserved for the observer to
make out two ships of war rigged with
square sails and long banks of dars with
men tugging at them. The remainder of
the field is occupied by animals, antelopes
and ostriches, with queer S-shaped marks
that were intended to represent flocks of
birds slttinc on the river banks.
Another valuable relic I* a Greek sepul
chral flask cf white clay marked with red.
â¢which belongs to a category that Is now
very rare and highly esteemed among
archaeologists. The figures in red are
beautifully drawn and represent them
making visits to the tombs of their fami
lies, whom they mown. One of these fig
ures is that of a young girl In the spirit
form sitting on the steps of her tomb
stone, who Is being visited by a young
man carrying a cpear and a young woman
bearing a casket containing offerings of
perfume and a funeral libation. Just a
touch of naturalism Is carried into the
scene by the picture of a heron, which in
the ancient days wandered about the
cemeteries and was petted by the visitors.
A portion of the collection has alreaay
arrived, but the greater part remaining
Is now en route from Antwerp in a sailing
vessel that will not reach San Francisco
for eix months. As fast as the materials
arrive, however, they will be Installed In
the bulldlr.g set apart at the Affiliated

mTEBESTTNG RELIC.
Dr. Emerson returns with a collection
ot ancient relics that is as rare and val
uable as any in America and forming the
liueleus for a museum that is destined to
â¢ qual any in the world. This was pessi-
Me through the generosity of Mrs. Phoebe
Hearst, who sent Dr. Emerson abroad
Â¦with a commission to rpend $20,000 In the
p<*arch for materials. Dr. Emerson spent
the money judiciously, but even so the
cost of the expedition wll! not be limited
by the original appropriation, as there
are freight charges and salaries to pay
that will bring the entire cost up to $35,

They were manufactured In the fourth,
third and second centuries before Christ,
chiefly in Tanagra, whose people burled
large numbers of them with their dead.
They were discovered in 1870 five
years later the supply was exhausted, so
that now they can only be acquired from
existing collections.
There Is a lady's toilet case that is ex
tremely rare. It contains a black back
ground, with figures In red showing the
lady in question receiving offerings from
Cupid and "Winged Victories. The neck
lace, bracelets and diadems on these fig
: ures are In relief, with traces of the- orig
inal gilding.
An Etruscan vase Is of very high an
tiquity. The Etruscans were fond of
, manufacturing vases in black, the black
being secured by painting the wei clay
with soot before firing-. These people
never painted their pottery, but adorned
it with leaves similar to those on sdme
Grecian jars.
The ancients, like ourselves, delighted
to decorate their walls with plates, which
they adorned with fantastic designs and
then hung with strings through holes
made for the purpose. Of these Dr. Em
erson has a number.
One of the most valuable relics is an
Etruscan fork of ten prongs, with which
the Etruscans roasted their meats. In the
Homeric poems frequent mention is made
, of the sacrificial feasts in which the
Greeks indulged,, and this tool, which is
made of bronze, is supposed to have been
used at these orgies. Another bronze
relic is a ring hoop with forty-five smaller
rings upon it. The archaeologists have
been unable to give a correct Interpreta
tion of it, but It is believed to be a Jug
gler's contrivance for performing tricks,
though it may have been a contrivance
designed to hold the smaller rings, which
were used by the ladies to pin their
gowns.
COLLECTION OF GLASS.
Then there is a large collection of an-
I dent glass, chiefly from Assyria. The
Assyria: s and Phoenicians made as free
use of glass as the Greeks did of earthen
ware, both for use in daily life. and as
mementoes for the dead. It seems to have
been the custom of the ancients to offer
perfumery to their dead, and sometimes
as many as fifty pieces of unbroken glass
ware are found in a. single tomb. â¢ The
glass is generally much lighter than the
glass of this day.
"I spent my first year In London, Paris
and Brussels," said Dr. Emerson to-day.
"These places are the headquarters for
the export trade In antiquities. * Fortu
nately at that time the Somzee collection
was being sold at auction in Brussels, and
I was enabled to secure many valuable
antiquities. Of the 400 Greek numbers I
purchased thirty-eight, which amounted
to one tenth of the value of tbe whole.

is cemented in a mass of calcareous rock
formation, in which are also the bones of
a human being, showing that the vessel
must have been buried with the dead.
An entirely different branch of pottery
is represented In the terra cotta "figur
ines," which are nothing more than stat
uettes cleverly modeled into figures rep
resenting ladies, youths, cupids and chil
dren. They are valuable chiefly because
they give a rather clearer idea of the
Greek in everyday life and his costume
than the large monumental figures usu
ally do.

Harmon's Will Filed.
A company, incorporated for a million
dollars and including among its members
the heads of all the leading redwood lum
ber corporations in California, notably
C. A. Hooper & Co., Pacific Lumber Com
pany, Union Lumber Company, Hammond
Lumber Company and other big concerns,
which have vast timber noldings in the
northern timber belts, will be launched in
a few days In this city.
Its main purposes are to give greater
impetus to the steadily increasing demand
for California redwood In the East. One
of the first moves to be made by the new
company will be the erection of sawing
and planing mills, sash and door factories
and a manufactory of wooden water pipe
and a big drying plant, a site for all of
which has been secured near Antloch, ad
joining the drying plant of tbe California
redwood shingle combine. It is purposed
to maintain a supply of between twenty
and thirty million feet of redwood lumber
for shipment to the Eastern markets.
Up to a few months ago the supply of
California redwood had not passed be
yond the local markets, the consumption
in the State being almost equal to the
supply of tne mills. "With the sudden de
mand for the wood in the East the pro
ducers here realized the necessity of an
organization that would be able to prop
erly foster this â new trade and act as a
distributor in foreign markets.
With these plans In view the larger
members of the redwood association got
together several weeks ago and have since
been quietly conferring at their exchange
at 6 California street. On Saturday -t ho
plans for the new company were fully
arranged and the entire matter turned
over to the association's lawyers, who are
now drawing up the articles of lncqrpora
tion. It has been estlma^d that nearly
one million dollars will be necessary to
start the new enterprise, and the greater
part of this sum has already been sub
scribed. In the drying of its redwood lum
ber . and planing It before shipment the
dealers will save a large, turn of money
in freight charges.
The company practically Is an adjunct
of tbe redwood association. Its agencies
for disbursing purposes will be established
in all the principal cities of the East.
Through this medium, the price ef Cali
fornia redwood will be controlled by the'
association which alms to maintain a
monopoly of the timber business in this
State.
COOPERSTOWN, N. T., Sept. 21.â A
riot by Italian laborers on the Oneonta.
Cooperstown and Richfield Springs Trol
ley Road to-day resulted in the death of
one Italian and the injury of General
Manager Tilton and a deputy sheriff.
The Italians are quartered In shanties a
little below the power house at Hartwlck.
Last night they built an obstruction on
the track and the first car that started
south to-day was halted. A telephone
message to Oneonta brought Receiver
Jenkins, General Manager Tilton and sev
eral deputies. When they set about re
moving the obstruction the Italians at
tacked them, firing pistols and throwing
stones. Tilton was struck on the right
temple with a stone and his face was
badly cut. A deputy sheriff received a
bullet wound In the head and waa also
gashed with a stone. Deputies and em
ploye? of the road returned the fire of the
Italics and one laborer was killed. The
rest was then duelled and traffic on the
road was resumed. Seven of the rioters
were arrested and held for examination.
The trouble grew out of the fact that
there is due the Italians two months'
wages for work done before the road went
into a receivership, but which cannot be
paid while the road Is In litigation. The
laborers have been paid for all work done
since the receivership began.

REDWOOD MEN
REACHING OUT
TORONTO, Ont.. Sept. 21.â Leopold J.
Stern of Baltimore, wanted in Washing
ton oa a charge of. conspiracy to fraud
the United States Government, appeared
in court this afternoon. Two officers
from Washington were present with a
new warrant certifying a charge different
from that first served and in order to
give the prosecution time to prepare their
case on the new charge an adjournment
was taken until to-morrow.
The warrant upon which the" case
against Stern Is based charges him with
having wrongfully obtained two money
warrants from the United States Post
office Department, one for $5023 in De
cember, 1902, and one for JK-27 In October,
1902.
A deposition made by "Walter J. Meyer,
postofllce inspector, also sets forth a
number of particulars in the United
States Government's case against Stern.
The deposition states that in June of 1893
a contract was made by United
States Government Postal Department
with Stern for the supply of .four differ
ent varieties of letter carriers' satchels.
Some of these were to be equipped with
straps. Â« The allegation is that Stern,
after being supplied at the instance of
the department with these straps by an
other contractor, charged their cost to
the department, which had already paid
the other contractor for them.

"I was enabled to secure some excellent

I spent one-fourth of the appropriation
on casts, and for the purpose of Instruc

originals.
SHOWN GREAT CIVTIilTY.
"I wa3 shown unusual civility by the
archaeologists of Europe, and I attribute
this to the estimable standing the Univer
sity of California has .acquired by reason
of the competition for the Hearst plans.
This was especially noticeable In France,
probably because Benard won - the first
prize. At the Louvre I was allowed to se
cure a mold of a bronze statue which had
never been cast before and which would
have been refused had It been for a less
conspicuous university than our own. I
tried to get It for another university of
America on my last visit to Europe, but
failed. The statue I refer to is an early
Greek Apollo, which was found at Piom
bino, Italy, on the coast of Etrurla. An
other copy I was allowed to make was of
a bronze charioteer found at Florence by
the French, a remarkable feature of
which are the eyeballs, inlaid with quartz
and onyx, which give it a most lifelike
appearance."
Dr. Emerson said that the building at
the Affiliated Colleges would be entirely
inadequate to contain the collection he
had purchased, and that the best he could
do would be to exhibit only the originals
of the collection. . .

I It Isn't the etern arm of the law that has

the supposedly hardened police detective.
"Denny" has capitulated to Mrs. Cath

in lies a bit of romance that does not

It was in the line of his work as a

the pleasant . memories awakened long
ago, and when he thought the time was
ripe the question was "popped."

case, John Hlggs and Dr. Angus of Pine
City, Wash., saved the Invalid wife of
Mr. Higgs and his little daughter from
the flames of a burning house last night.
Despite the brave work of Dr. Angus,
who carried the little girl out In hla arms,
the child was so badly burned thaVehe
died early this morning. Dr. Angus also
received such serious burns that his con
dition is critical.
The lire started from a gasoline explo
sion. Mrs. Higgs is In delicate health
and her husband and the family physi
cian were. giving her a vapor bath, using
gasoline. The substance exploded and in
a moment the room was a mass of
flames. The doctor called upon Higgs
to save his wife and then made a dasn
for an upstairs room where two little
children were sleeping. Hastily rousing
the boy the doctor assisted him to wrap
himself up and flee down the stairs and
from the burning building. Dr. Angus
then picked up the little girl and started
out. Â«
By this time the whole house waa in
flames and with great difficulty the man
made his escape, bearing his human bur
den. Mrs. Hlggs received severe burns
and this with her terrible fright and ill
ness makes her recovery most doubtful.

"TC1LLEMSTAD. Sept. a.â The steamer
Maracalbo haa Just arrived from Vene
zuela with a number of foreign notabili
ties on board. They report that the Car
acas Dress la still fiercely attacking the
foreign and mixed tribunals and the for
eign umpire*. Yesterday it was Belgium.
To-day It U Mexico.
Obeying, it is said. President Castro's
ortferg, the papers, having learned .that
Senor Otero, who umpires the Mexican
claims, Eenor Duret, the commissioner.
and Senor Guzman, the agent, all of the
Mexican tribunal ar.i^ leading figures in
Mexican society, will on the Mexican In
dependence day give a dinner and ball to
friends in a house belonging to a citizen
of the United States, printed violent ar
ticles threatening to publish the names of
sixteen leaders of Caracas society, who
had accepted Invitations to be present as
"anti-patriots" and as "guilty of aa act
of les patrie" In going to a ball given by
foreigners "claiming money from. Vene
zuela."
Besides this, menacing letters were sent
to the members of the Mexican commis
sion, and, a popular demonstration
against the commissioners having been
premeditated, the Mexican commission
withdrew Invitations to the ball, so aa
not to cause a conflict. Some Idea of the
tone of the press against foreigners may
be gathered from Â£1 Combate of Caracas,
which, after criticizing ail the umpires,
said:
Tes. let them take our gold, but let them
not celebrate at a social gathering the con
summation of their Infamy.
Let them feet our banknotes, but let not
their speculators' hands encircle the flexible
waUts of our Queens of the drawing-rooms.
Let them drink champagne and drown them
selves In the foam of liquor, but let them
not clink their cups with thoae of the victims
whom they have come to sacrifice.
It la reported in Caracas* that El Na
donallsta. classed as the organ of General
Fernandez, the Venezuelan Minister, Is
the most bitter of all the papers in the
campaign*
Tht* umpires have not been paid by
Venezuela.

there is no longer room for doubt that the un

in high esteem by his shipmates, and It was
i.< -t until hp had waited as long as he dared

The St. Francis left Puget Sound early
last month with a cargo of 6000 tons of
coal consigned to the Alaska Commercial
Company.
The fire was discovered In the forward
hatch v on September 7, some 600 miles
south of Dutch Harbor, and made such
headway that it was thought at one time
It would become necessary to abandon the
vessel. The crew, however, by working
the ' pumpa continuously succeeded in
keeping the fire In check until Dutch Har
bor was reached.
ASTORIA, Or., Sept. 21.â H. M. S^ Shear
water, which reached Comox to-day from
Bering Sea, reports that~ the American
coal-laden ship St. Francis is at Dutch
Harbor with her <fergo on fire. The 17. S.
S. Manning was alongside preparing to
flood the ship.
Elaborate musical programmes have
been arranged and the choirs have been
augmented for the festival of the Jewish
new year. One feature will be the ren
dering of ancient religious melodies.
This morning there will be services in
si! the Fynagogues of the city, and with
the exception of Temple Emanu-El there
will be services again to-morrow morn
ing.
At the Bush-street Synagogue the Rev.
Vr. Ifadore Meyers officiated last night,
his sermon being on "New Year Gifts." "
Tlztbi Levy will preach sermons before
Ms congregation at the Gears-street Tem
ple this and to-morrow mornings.
Services were held at the new syna
gogue, Keneseth Israel, Russ street.
"The coming man." said Dr. Voorsar.g
cr. "never comes, always is. and h<* is
God's man; and God's men are needed to
accomplish a destiny for the human race
fi;r beyond the material considerations of
present day civilization."
The Rev. Dr. Yoorsranger in his lecture
cn "The Coming Man" at the Temple
Kmanu-El began by saying that they
â¢would meet the incoming year with the
pieatest satisfaction because, he said, the
pound of the ax and the hammer was*
heard in the land, while theirs was the
earning of the ax and the hammer.
Throughout the land, he s?.id, an army
v\>?s busy with the ingathering of the
fruit, but they, he said. w<Â»re privileged
to rejoice in the ingathering because a
considerable part belonged to them.
Dr. Voorsanger said that in the aggre
gate the work of their hand? had suc
ceeded perhaps beyond their expectation,
and through tLe pushing crowds and
heaving multitudes many had come to
the front. Dr. Voorsanger denied that
there was a "coming man." That man
i:pr>n whose face shone the light of God
v.as always with them, though, like dia
monds in the depths of the earth, he was
r.nly discovered hy xihat they called acci
dent. But, said the doctor, he was there
nevertheless, and was doing Gcd'3 work,
and that work would count in the aggre
gate until the lineaments on his face were
photographed on the entire generation.
GOO'S MEN NEEDED.
l:i passir.g over the happenings of the
last year Dr. JCieto showed how even the
calamities that had befallen the Jewish
people had heightened their joy, in 60 far
as it had convinced them not only that
they were strong enough to maintain
their cause, Wut were yet embarked upon
a spiritual mission that was well worth
the suffering.
Dr. Nieto said that Israel's mission
would not be ended until full equality be
granted all men in every country, without
regard to religion or "any other artificial
distinction."
Sacred memories, he said, followed side
by side with sensations ot happiness. Sor
row heightened their joys because it sea
soned them with a higher thought and
imparted to them therefore a more sub- !
lime significance.
CALAMITIES HEIGHTEN JOY.
The religious exercises at the uyna-
Eogues last evening were impressive. At
5:30 o'clock the Kev. Dr. Jacob N'ieto de
livered a short address at Sherith Israel.
He chose for his subject "The Sorrows
that Heighten Our Joy?." showing that
â¢Â¦ven the most dreadful experiences served
tu consecrate their joyous moments.
The shofar, or ram's horn, which is
blown at this time. Is symbolic of this
awakening.
The new year services, it is pointed out,
are preparatory to*he day of atonement
and are intended to awaken religious real.
M that man may be ready to recommence
his spiritual ascent as the result of the
religious exercises of the day of atone
ment.
The eve of the new year 56G4, according
to the Jewish calendar, was celebrated
last night. Services were held In all the
synagogues jÂ±t sundown. It beinjj part of
the Jewish system to make of all their
religious observances "home . celebra
tions," to encourage family gatherings,
and thus promote tfiat unison of Interest
and sentiment which Intensifies family
union, there were gatherings of relatives
and friends at the Jewish homes after tlie
services at the synagogues.

COLBY, Kan., Sept. 21.â Considerable
trouble is being experienced with the set
tlers who persist in committing depreda
tions on the Dewey ranch In this county.
Three houses have been burned on the
ranch during the past eek. Detecthre3
have been employed by t v .j Deweys to
look into the matter. Ever since the kill
ing of the Berry family by the Deweys
last May there has been much more bad
feeling ehown against the Deweys than
formerly. The settlers are now decidedly
hostile to the ranchmen.
Houses Are Burned at Dewey Banch.
The fruit market waa rather quiet, as the
demand for local consumption was slack and
there was practically no inquiry for shipping.
Receipts, however, were light and the quota
tions showed but slight variation, although
prices of some descriptions tended downward.
Stocks of Peaches In email boxes consisted
chiefly of second quality offering^ which
ruled weak at previous prices. The â¢ canners
were purchasing Salways tn bulk at the quoted
rates and paid as high as $30- per ton for
occasional lots of Clingstones. Apples, Pears,
Quinces and Pomegranates were, in the supply
and stood about as previously quoted, with
the demand limited and confined chiefly to
fancy stock. ' Prunes and table Grapes in
crates were easy owing to the lack of demand
for shipping. -The toD quotation for Grapes
ln-crtttes waa obtained only for strictly fancy
offerings, (55c being the top for the general
run of supplies, excepting the Isabella variety.
Wine Grapes were moderately active . at pre
vious prices, with receipts ample. Receipt*
of Figs were less liberal than on Saturday, but
were still too heavy for the market to absorb
and prices continued to have a wide range.
The â¢ cool, cloudy weather had a depressing
effect on the Melon market and the light re
ceipts proved excessive. -" Only a small, portion
of the receipts brought the top quotations
Several lots of c small green Nutmeg , Melons
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.

NEW YORK, Sert. 21. â There was a period
â¢ <"Â°f <Ierression in the stock market to-<5ay, but
the market recovered later in the day and
wiped out mo8t of the declines. The cover-
Ing of Ehorts by the bears was the principal
rlement in the rally, but the bears were
r>rr.ropted to this course by the lessened anxiety
. manifested by the real owners of stocks. Th^
principal factor in the relief of sentiment was
the news from the crop region and its eff*-t
ujxjn the grain market. The weather map
vps rej>orted an ideal one for all clayses of
erojis. In addition to this present condition
tr.e weekly statistics of railroad traffic Fhowc-d
a large Increase in the movement of corn, es
peoialiy in the shipments of grain from pri
mary point*, which showed an Increase of
M3.0U0 bushels over the week before. It was
artrued that if th* farmers were willing to
jiart bo freely with their holdings of corn it
wrved to discredit last week's reports of ex
.<.,Â¦â¢.. frotl danasc to the cereal. ThÂ» course
of I'nlted StatPs- ?teel Â«aÂ» watched with great
interest, and its decline to a Fhade below Â«he
lowf-M record which was reached last week
?r.ccuraged the traders to Bell the rest of the
â¢list.
The assertion was circulated that the-lead
ing banking imprests in the steel corporation
had ext.i^fced tho opinion that there waÂ» no
â¢ Â¦c*-aÂ«i?n for supporting measures in the stock
ir.ark*t. Other Ftocks in which this intereFt
was dominant were affected. It was evident,
however, that support was afforded I'nited
States Fu-el. The fact that a number of the
iron and et*Â«I industrial commanded a pre
m.um in the loan department this morning
*prved as Â» wamlne to the l>eare that their
side ha<l been overselling the . market and
jÂ»rpmrtfd them tn cover. While the disposi
tion to s^ll stocks was thug curbed in the
â¢-curse of the das*, no important demand was
awakened, end the market showed increasing
' <1ullnes.s tn the enure* of the rally. The finan
cial district continued in a etr.te of uncer
tainty and apprehension over the p<>sMble ex
tensler: of the reaction end construction to the
commercial world at large. Allegations have
been made that the demand for mercantile
tredit.s is showing great urgency and thai
high rates are paid for these credits. Inquiry
nrrxjr.g barkers tn the Wall-street dUtrlrt
failed to bear out this assertion. Prime grades
of papT negotiated through customary chan
nels bring B to CVa per cent. For names less
well known End fcr applications from other
than their regular customers bankers are In
clined to ask higher rate* or are indisposed to
lend at all. This ts in accordance with the
knowledge thet the whole banking fabric of
the country ha Â» lÂ»*en devoting Itself for some
menth! i as* to preparations to supply the reg
ular legitimate ccmrr.eroial demands for
Mercantile credits. The returns received from
day to day by the Comptroller of the condi
tion of the national banks at interior cities
Â«how a ireneral Improvement in percentage of
i-eiierve over that for the corresponding period
of last year and encourage the growing hope
that the regular course of bueinefn will not
Jpo disturbed by lack of funds this autumn.

There were liberal supplies of Potatoes, par
ticularly river kinds, and the market con
'tlnued rather quiet, owing to the absence of
demand for shipping. Trading In Salinas
Burbanks for local use was moderately active
and trices were steady. Sweet Potatoes we*Â»
easier under heavy receipts, four cars being
received from Merced. Choice offerings In
boxes from Stockton were held at $1 50 per
cental, but moved slowly. Onions were plen
tiful and moved slowly at the long estab
lished prices.
Receipts of several kinds of vegetables were
light, aa usual on Monday, and prices of some
descriptions ranged higher. Tomatoes arrived
freely and were easy, with poor quality ofter
lnÂ«s of bay going to the canners at the min
imum quotation. The demand from the reg
ular trade was fair, but offerings had to be
strictly fancy to bring over 50c per box.
String, Wax and Lima Beans and Green Corn
were In limited supply and cleaned up quickly.
Lima Beane and Green Corn selling at higher
rates. Green Okra. Cucumbers and Summer
Squash cleaned up well at firmer prices. All
other descriptions stood as previously quoted.

Â¦ Hops continue firm. Late mall advices
from New York say of the estimated yield:
."Owing to the prevalence e-f mold in Oregon
It is generally conceded that there will be
considerable irregularity to ths quality of the
crop of that State; the estimated yield Is
80.000 to 85,000 bales. The California crop is
estimated at 50,000 bales of average quality
and the yield in Washington Is estimated at
35,000 bales. Advices from up the State re
,ported .strong markets, and prices quoted
.ranged from 24c to 30c, according to quality.
The majority of the advices report considerable
irregularity in quality and the estimated yield
of the State Is generally placed at not more
that 50.000 bales. Lattst cable advices re
ceived from England Indicate that the damage
done by the gale of last week affected the
quality more than the quantity. In a few
Instances, however, estimates of the yield
were reduced slightly and now range from
40(1,000 to 44O.(XM> cwt; the English markets
were reported firm at prices showing advances
during the past couple of days of equal to
about 3c i>ft pound. German cable advicÂ«Â»

CHICAGO, Sept. 21. â The wheat market had
no bullish news from anywhere during -the
greater part of the session. The start was in
fluenced by good weather, weak cables and corn
weakness, December opening with a loes of %@
'^c at 78%c to 7S T /Â»c. and except for a spurt
during the first hour to 79%c on covering by lo
cal ehorts. the market received but little sup
port and declined steadily under pressure of
long selling until the low mark was reached at
78i*Â®7Â»Vic for December. The Northwest.
Southweet and local houses dumped their hold
ings upon the market and etop loss ordera came
out Near the close reports of export buslneE?
frcra the seaboard caused some of the early
tellers to turn buyer* and a little better feeling
resulted. December r'eaÂ«ted,to 78>4Qi789ic, but
with little ehow of strength closed at a loss of
lVi@l%c
Corn opened %<Â£tl\i>c lower and showed addi
tional weakness as the session advanced. Good
weather in the corn belt was responsible for un
loading by longs, and there was but little sup
port at this point on the way down. The eell-
Ing was general, most of the offerings being
long corn. The country vu also a heavy seller
of both cash and futures. December closed
with a net loso of 2>4c to 46%c, the bottom
price of the day.
Oats sympathized with corn and wheat and
the market was easy and sold off early. Trade
was large and the sentiment was mixed. De
cember closed at 35^ie, a loes of %c.
The demand for October ribs, presumably
from packing-house Interests, was heavy and
that product showed an advance at the close of
15c. The rest of the Hit was weak in sympa
thy with corn, October pork closing 47 %c lower
and lard down 20c.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Chicago Grain Market.
Trading in local stocks and bonds was fair,
but fluctuations were narrow, and the mar
ket wu without feature. Spring VaÂ«cy Water
was weaker at ?S3 50. The oil stocks were
inactive.

BOARD 0E EDUCATION
VOTES FOR BONDING
Adopts Beport Which Calls for an
Way back In the '90'a the Southern Pa
cific made a similar attempt to seize the
large area of land and drove a similar
line of piles in the same place. These,
however, were pulled up by Governor Par
dee, then Mayor of Oakland, as it was al
leged the company was shutting off tho
city from the bay.
The fact that the Government .'dredgers
are now filling In this land possibly ac
counts for the present action of the com
pany, as it will save much money in the
completion of the filling of the property.
George W. Dornln, president of the City
Council, stated last night that the city of
ficials were not sure Just what move the
Southern Pacific was contemplating, but
that its actions would be Investigated.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company
has again commenced operations to re
claim the vast stretch of tide land be
tween the retaining wall of the Oakland
estuary and the- broad gauge mole.
A line of sheathed piles has been driven
during the last two days from the end
of the estuary retaining wall out into the
bay for about a mile, which if extended
would join the broad gauge mole at about
Its middle.
On the tide land, for which this line
of piles completes the fourth boundary,
the dredgers now at work for the Govern
ment deepening the estuary are by means
of their patent suction pumps dumping
their mud and debris. The area of land
back of the Southern Pacific line of piles
and' which the company seems to be con
templating laying claim to will soon be
filled, or partially filled In, by the debris
the dredgers are now dumping Into It
The land Inclosed by the company's
piles is tide land, and at full tide Is cov
ered by but little water.
As the Southern Pacific owns all the
land , fronting on the bay between the
harbor entrance and the broad gauge
mole It will, thus acquire a vast area cap
able of being: readily filled in for a mile
and a quarter east and west and a mile
and a half north and south. When the
land Is filled In the area will embrace
over 1000 acres of valuable terminal land,
which In years to come would be worth a
large sum of money to the company pro
viding it can establish a valid title to the
land. ' <

strongly to the speaker, but he demand
ed that boys and girls. shall be able to
do good, to be good for something.
. With a sound body, a sound mind and
sound morals, success was reasonably in
view, when supplemented by of
the right sort. Enjoyment of life might
also be expected upon such bases.

The festival of the Yeong Wo Assccla
tion, which will continue for eight days,
is held annually, commencing on the lirst
day of the eighth month of the Chinese
year, and is religious in its nature. It
is held primarily to propitiate the joss of
the association for a continuance of pros
perity through the ensuing year. Offer
ings are made by the priests, and to the
accompaniment of an orchestra of soloists
the events of the past year are related to
the joss. Members of the association do
nate presents according to their means
and this year some very valuable, works
of art have been received. , .
The officers of the association in this
city are Chung Wai Gue, president; Ung

secretary. Jang Wah, "also known as
John Hook, who occupies the position
of secretary. Is a recent arrival - from
China. , Me .has a charming personality
and speaks English fluently, having
graduated from one of .the largest and
most progressive universities of China.
He is a deep thinker and - was " elected
to his present position solely through his
popularity.- In speaking . of . the festival
and the association yesterday he. said:
Our organization is "composed of thelnhab-
Itams of three counties and . twelve districts

our members are substantial business men and
the property at 724 to 730 Sacramento street
is owned by the association. The association
represents one of the â¢ Six Companies and
wields much Influence In the United States.
The celebration is a religious affair, which is
given annually for eight days. From fSOOOto
$10,000 is spent during the festival and no
meat or anything containing blood , is eaten
during the eight-days. . . v-
TO PROPITIATE JOSS.
Skillful hands had transformed the spa
clous rooms of the association into a
scene of Oriental splendor that suggested
Aladdin's cave. On the walls of the main
chamber over two score of artistic wax
groups, symbolical of various epochs In
the history of ancient China, had been
hung, each so perfect in detail. that it re
quired but little play of the imagination
to bring the delusion that the actual
scenes of past centuries were being wit
nessed through the large end of an opera
glass. At each end of the room a monster
papier raachc figure of the See Die Gum
giants frowned threateningly upbn the
visiting horde of the slant-eyed disciples
of Confucius. The services of the elec
trician has also been enlisted and myriad
lights lend additional attractiveness to
the scene. Three hundred jars of esthetic
chrysanthemums of various hues, donated
by the Hip Sin Tong, occupied a promi
nent place In the decorative scheme. In

Dasha was the first one called in and
he was irlven to understand that Gamble
had Implicated him in his confession,
which was a fact He stubbornly resisted
evtry effort to force an acknowledgment
of his and his fellow jailers' complicity
in the substitution work. After an hour
of sweating- he finally broke down and
confessed. He was taken to a room by
himself and Burnett called In. He was
told that Dasha had confessed. Burnett
broke down and told everything. Then
Dempsey was called in and under the be
lief that both Burnett and Dasha had
confessed made certain admissions about
receiving money from them that served
to clinch his complicity In the crime.
All tliree men were then brought to
gether and under the guise of harmonizing
their three statements Burnett was made
to repeat his confession to Dasha and
Dempsey. Dasha then weakened and
confessed, but Dempsey remained obdu
rate, professing Ignorance of what was
done by bis fellow watchers at the JaJL
The story of how the confessions were
secured from Dasha and Burnett and of
how even Dempsey was made to acknowl
edge some facts that connect him with
participation in the work of substitution
leaked out yesterday. When the three
jailers were taken into custody . Friday
night they were confined In a room In a
Montgomery-street hotel. Secret Service
Agrnts William J. Burns and Harry Mof
fitt, United Stages District Attorney,
Woodworth, Sheriff Lackmann and
Vnited States Marshal Shine were in an
adjoining- room. Burns Is from Washing
ton and is considered one of the shrewd
Â«-.;t men In the service. To him Is cred
ited the ruse- by which the confessions
were obtained.
"You bet there were," he replied, "and
thry were the ones who did the grafting."
"Then there were others In it besides
those arrested?" he was asked.
"I will be able to show," he said, "when
this thing comes to a hearing that I have
done nothing unlawful and I will point
out who the real grafters were."
It appears now that Dempsey is the
only one who will make a contention of
innocence. The Federal authorities claim
to have signed confessions from Burnett
and Dasha and also assert that Demp
sey made verbal admissions, which he
later refused to confirm in writing. This
Dempecy denies and maintains that he
has done nothing criminal. He Is the only
one of the trio who would talk yesterday
end his conversation regarding the
charges was guarded.
All three Â«f the night jailers at the
County Jail, who are accused of com
plicity in the Chinese substitution scandal
and who have been in custody since FM
day night, were released yesterday on
bonds of J2O0O each. Burnett was the first
to gain his freedom, his bonds being fur
nished by a surety company. Shortly
after noon Deir.psey's bonds were se
cured, his appearance being: guaranteed
by a surety company. It was not until
after 5 o'clock that Dasha gained his lib
erty. Arrangements were made with the
rarae surety company to go on his bonds,
but in the preparation of the papers the
offense with which he is charged was
omitted. Consequently there was a delay
cf a couple of hours in redrawing the pa
pers.
The Federal Grand Jury mot in special
session yesterday afternoon to consider
the substitution cases. The three night
jailers were before them and separately
gave about the same information they
had previously imparted to the Federal
authorities.
The three men Â¦will not be accused of
the felony charge of conspiracy, but will
be indicted and prosecuted for aiding and
abfiting the substitution of Chinese,
which is a misdemeanor punishable by
not more than one year's imprisonment in
the County Jail or a tine not exceeding
$1000. or both. This clemency has been
determined upon by the Federal authori
ties partly because of the confessions
made by Burnett and Dasha and the ad
missions made by Dcmpsoy and partly in
the hope that with the lesser penalty to
pay the three men will obviate the ne
cessity and uncertainty cf trials by plead
ing guilty. Accordingly the Federal
Grand Jury will be asked to Indict the
men only on the lighter charge.
PROTESTS INNOCENCE.
In addition to those indicated, the prob
able guilt of two other men whose occu
pation is that cf "capper" for certain at
torneys handling Chinese business has
been established and if the expected de
velopments take place they will be ar
rested for connection with the substitu
tion of Chinese.
Three more deputy Sheriffs em
ployed at the County Jail as jail
ers and one and perhaps two dep
uty United States Marshals will,
in all probability, be connected
criminally with the unlawful sub
stitution of Chinese before the in
vestigation now in progress is
ended- The evidence obtained
against them is said not to be
conclusive, but is sufficiently
strong to warrant something more
than a suspicion that they have
been actively implicated in the il
legal traffic for which three white
men and three Chinamen are un
der arrest, and on account of
which William P. Gamble put an
end to his life.
The investigation may even go
further. There are strong sus
picions that Federal officials
higher up than the men directly
charged with the offense of Chi
nese substitution exercised a tacit
acquiescence in the traffic. Their
actions in this matter are being
scrutinized with the utmost care
by the secret service agents en
gaged in the investigation, and it
need cause no surprise if an up
heaval in at least two of the im
portant Federal offices in this city
should follow.
Three Under Sheriffs, "Who Are
Charg-ed "With Complicity, Give
Bail â Horn Toon Defaults
on Another Charge-
Now that he is dead there are many
stories told of the generosity and kind
ness of heart which was a distinguishing
trait of the dead man. A notable in
stance of this was when Julian B. Arnold,
son of Sir Edwin Arnold, author of the
"Light of Asia," was arrested here,
charged with the embezzlement of several
hundred thousand dollars in England. He
was a Federal prisoner and ordered de
ported. All of the money In his posses
sion was taken from him and his wife
was left destitute In a strange city. 3am
ble, who, as custodian of the prison,'-Be
came acquainted with Mrs. Arnold's con
dition, took her to the hotel where he and
his wife resided and out of his own
pocket defrayed her expenses until such
a time as she could receive assistance
from her friends in England.
All that was mortal of William P;
Gamble was laid away in a receiving
vault at Mountain View Cemetery, Oak
land, yesterday. The funeral services
Â¦were held from Halstead's undertaking
establishment and an Immense concourse
of friends of the dead man gathered to
pay their last tribute of respect. Event
ually the body will be Interred at the
home of his youth in Tuolumne County.
Gamble's confession did not implicate
other deputy marshals. In fact It was
only after the utmost persuasion that he
was induced to disclose the connection of
Dasha, Burnett and Dempsey with the
work. But other deputies have handled
v-hinese ordered for deportation, and they
might have entered Into the substitution
conspiracy without the personal knowl
edge of Gamble. If, in his attempt to
clear himself, Dempsey makes public all
he knows of the matter, as he threatens
to do, It may be that others in the Mar
shal's office the ill-fated Gamble
will be dragged in.
GAMBLE'S FUNERAL.
The continued activity of the Federal
authorities gives rise to the suspicion
that the end of the substitution scandal
has not been reached. There are half
veiled assertions of those supposed to
know that there are one or more deputy
marshals in addition to Gamble who Â¦were
sharing in this unlawful money. United
States District Attorney Woodworth rays
that all of the white men suspected of
complicity in the pcandal have been ar
rested. United States Marshal Shine
claims that no one else in his office had
any hand in the unlawful substitution of
Chinese. But both of these officials have
made a deliberate practice of giving out
misleading statements In connection with
this matter and only admitted the truth
when forced to by the exclusive publica
tion in The Call of Gamble's confession.
MAY BE OTHERS.
Horn Toon, one of the Chinese Impli
cated in the substitution cases. Is a
much sought individual just at present.
Besides being wanted mightily by the
Federal officers he is a defaulter from
justice in the courts of the city and
county of San Francisco. He was ar
rested some time ago charged with subor
nation of perjury in the cases of eleven
Chinamen arrested for conspiracy to mur
der. Yesterday his case was called for
preliminary examination before Judge
Cabanlss, but the much troubled Oriental
did not appear. At the request of his at
torney he was given until Thursday
morning to come into court, and if he
does not make an apponrance by that
time his bail of $2Â»J00 will be declared for
feited.
The story that the conspirators met
at Dasha's house on the night of Sep
tember 11 and divided the spoils of their
crime is untrue. As a matter of fact, ac
cording to Gamble and the Federal au
thorities who are handling the case, there
was no money paid over for this last deal,
as it was only partially successful and the
Chinese refused to produce the amount
promised.
By consent of the attorneys Burnett's
preliminary hearing -will take place at
1:30 p. m. October 7 and the hearing of
Dasha and Dempsey on the day following
at 10 o'clock a. m.
PRELIMINARY HEARINGS.
Burnett's and Dasha's statements were
reduced to writing and signed by them.
Dempsey refused to sign anything. All
of the questioning was done by Secret
Service Agent Burns, and to his persua
sive ability and cunning may be attrib
uted the securing of the confessions.
Barris' son James and George O'Don
nell, another boy, were in Police Juogo
Mogan's, court yesterday on a charge of
malicious mischief for breaking a window
during a fight on Saturday night. The
boys were arrested by Policemen Rear
don and Foley, but Krueger voluntarily
came to court and testified that Barris'
son was a bad boy. Barris said to Krue
ger in court, "Although you have it in for
me you needn't have It in for the t>oy."
After the case was disposed of and while
Krueger was passing Barris the latter
said something to Krucger in a low voice.
Barris and his attorney, E. Shortall,
were talking quietly in the corridor to
the woman whose window was broken,
when Krueger made a rush at Barris.
Barris asked what was the matter and
Krueger told him he was under arrest
for disturbing the peace. A crowd quick
ly gathered and followed the policeman
and his prisoner to the elevator. In the
elevator Barris told Krueger he would
bring him before the Police Commlss'on
ers and prove to them that he was the
worst policeman on the force. '
Barris was a witness before the Police
Board last July against Krueger, who was
charged with breaking the ribs of ahand
cuffed prisoner in the patrol wagon on
the night of July 4. Krueger was con
victed and fined, and Barris says that he
swore to get even with him for testifying
against him.

The committee on platform and resolu

night. There was quite a discussion over
a proposition to Indorse all the Repub
lican officeholders of the present admin
istration. There was a strong sentiment
in favor of limiting the indorsement to
men whose devotion to public duty had
won universal commendation. It Â¦was
finally decided to indorse all the Repub
lican officials. /*
Several planks for the platform were
presented. It was resolved that a sub
committee consisting of Charles Ronntag
W. J. Herrin, E. , M. Ritter, Charles H.
J. Truman and Ralph L. Hathorn should
be appointed to -consider the material in

PLATFORM AND RESOLUTIONS.
One day last week, and since the or
ganization of the Republican Municipal
Convention, A. Ruef waited on a promi
nent merchant of this city and suggested
that the latter should call on Mayor
Schmitz. The merchant did not mani
fest any particular desire to renew his
with our versatile Mayor.
He said to Mr. Ruef: "I supported Mr.
Schmitz two years ago and ~e" did not
keep his proml.se made to me concerning
an appointment." To this Mr. Ruef re
joined: "The promise of an appointment
two years ago was not made in my pres
ence. I will go with you this time and
he will promise you, in my presence, an
appointment aijd he will keep his prom
ise." There is nothing remarkable about
this incident in itself. Greater men than
Mayor Schmitz have made promises
which they did not fulfill, and it is even
asserted that such promises have been
made to men other than merchants and
to voters other than those who are al
lied with the Union Labor and Demo
cratic parties. The significant phase of
the interview between Mr. Ruef and his
mercantile friend presents Itself when one
reflects that Mr. Ruef is one of the or
ganizers of the United Republican League,
a delegate to the Republican Municipal
Convention and chairman of the Forty
fifth Assembly District Republican dele
gation.
MAYOR'S BROKEN PROMISES.
Because the Mayor assumes the right to
belong to all parties and to bestow his
promises like the dews of heaven on the
just as well as the unjust is no reason
why the chairman of the Forty-fifth Dis
trict delegation should expect the same
special privilege. Mayor Schmitz had the
decent consistency to withdraw from the
Republican Primary League when he
joined the Union Labor party. Whatever
may be said relating to Mayor Schmitz's
attainments as a rapid change artist on
the political stage. It must be said to his
credit that he gets out of one party be
fore he joins another. Ruef, however,
seems to insist on the privilege of repre
senting Republicans in the convention of
that party and at the same time repre
senting Ruef in the inner circles of the
Union Labor party. The fact Is of record
and of common knowledge that Mr. Ruef
participated as a delegate in the organiza
tion of the Republican convention.
A. Ruef appears also to be keeping some
thing of a record of tho Mayor's broken
promises. He remarked to the merchant
whose support he solicited on behalf of
Mayor Schmitz that the Mayor did not
appoint Morris Levy according to prom
ise. It was mentioned in the conversation
that the promise to appoint Levy was
made when Mr. Ruef was not present.
Gossip goes to the effect that the Levy
purse, not so blamed easy to open in be
half of every attraction, opened out baau
tifully in view of the rainbow promises
of the last campaign.
FLIRTING WITH DEMOCRATS.
According to political gossip Ruef is
not the only friend of the local adminis
tration that is doing missionary work
outside of his own camp. One day last
week George B. Keane, the Mayor's sec
retary, accompanied by four delegates to
the Union Labor party convention, called
upon Richard Whelan, prospective nomi
nee for Sheriff on the Democratic ticket,
and tendered the labor nomination to the
aforesaid Whelan. Already two Blated
Democratic nominees have been nomi
nated by the Schmitz wing of the Union
Labor party and, there are signs of a
storm of remonstrance In the Democratic
convention to-night. Inside Intelligence
is to the effect that the convention this
evening will exclude every man that
takes a nomination from another party
convention. It ia said that the ban will
Include judicial nominees. Th*ere seems
to be a determined purpose in the Demo
cratic party to preserve the organiza
tion for what it 13 worth and not to per
mit grafting politicians to trade away
its prestige.
The Republicans have resolved that the
nominees of the Republican party shall
stand on the platform of the Republican
convention. The people of the nation
have placed national affairs in the keep
ing of the Republican party, the people
of California have entrusted the manage
ment of State affairs to Republicans, and
there Is a belief that the Republicans are
capable of conducting local affairs. The
convention proposes to nominate a ticket
worthy* of support and it will expect Re
publicans to support it.
In his confession Graves Implicates sev
eral merchants who purchased the stolen
articles from the thieves. The detectives
will probably arre3t these parties and
they will be held to answer for havine
received stolen goods. What the names
of the men are the police refused to state
until the arrests have been made. Graves
stated that he had participated in five
crimes. After stealing the box of tools
they were sold for $5. The 400 pounds of
butter was disposed of for $33 and the
case of shoes went for $20. Tho highest
price realized was for the 2500 cigars,
which brought $76.
B. Solomon of the Solomonson, Hart
man, Solomon Company, 105 Third Street,
delivered to the property clerk at thÂ» Hall
of Justice yesterday 5000 "Gaston" cigars,
for which the Southern Paciflc paid a
claim of $430 to Rlnaldo Bros. The detec
tives allege that these cigars werÂ» stolen
on June 19 from an Incoming freight car
by Frank Carey and Rutherford. Tha
original cases were burned In the stove
in the caboose and the cigars were car
ried to Charles & Graves' house on Perry
street. That evening .Rutherford got an
expressman and the cigars, which had
been packed In hampers, were taken to
the Solomonson, Hartman, Solomon Com
pany's store and sold for $211.
Charles B. Graves, one of the prisoners,
who has been in the City and County
Hospital since his arrest, made a com
plete confession to Detectives Ryan and
Lewin last night. "While In the hospital
Graveg maintained a strict silence and re
fused to discuss the case in any form.
Last night, when he was taken to
the City Prison, where he was booked, en
route to Salinas to answer for his crime,
he broke down and confessed all.
Ryan and Lewin say they have discov
ered that in April last Slater and Hardin
stole 5000 cigars at San Bruno station
from an incoming freight car. The cigars
were carried to the caboose, whera the
original cases were burned and tha cis
ars packed into three baskets. The bas
kets were carried to Rutherford's house
in South Park and next .day Rutherford
and Slater took the baskets to the cigar
store of Max Katzauer at Third and
Townsend streets, who is now awaiting
trial for receiving stolen property, and
sold the cigars to him. Slater is also ac
cused of having stolen four tubs of but
ter from a car at San Bruno station la
March last and It Is claimed that he and
Rutherford and Hardin have stolen thou
sands of dollars' worth of cigars and to
bacco since October last.
William E. Slater, a former bralceman
en the Southern Pacific, called at tha City
Prison yesterday afternoon to sea- C. A.
Rutherford, the braieman under arrest
for stealing goods from railroad cars.
Detective Sergeant Ryan and Detectlv*
Peter Lewin of the Southern Pacific were
in the prison at the time and, going up to
Slater said, "You have saved ua a trip to
Fresno, as we were to leave this evening
to arrest you." Slater was very much
disgusted when he was locked up.
Lewin immediately went to Third and
Townsend streets and arrested Richard
W. Hardin, a brakeman, and took him
to the prison. Hardin is a brother-in-law
of W. H. Beauregard, the fugutlve
Southern Pacific conductor, and Slater be
fore resigning from the Southern Paciflc
on April 14, last, lived with Rutherford
and was for some time of the same tram
crew as Rutherford and Hardin. Ho has
since been employed by the Santa Fa at
Fresno.

CURED BYCUTICURA
11 When my little boy was abont threÂ«
months old his head broke oat with a
rash, which Â¦was rery Itchy and ran con*
" slderable watery floid. We tried every-
thing we could, bat he got worse all
the time till it spread to his arms, legs,
and then to his entire body, and he eol
bo bad that he came near dying. Tha
rash wonld itch so that he wonld
scratch till the blood ran, and a thin
yellowish stnff wonld be all over hla
pillow in the morning. I had to pni
mittens on his hands to keep him from
tearing his skin around his wrists. He
got so weak and run down that he took
fainting spells like we would think hira
dying. He was almost a skeleton and
his little bands were thin like claws.
â¢â¢ He was bad abont eight months when
we tried Cnticnra Remedies. I had not
laid him down in his cradle In the day
time for a long time. He had got so
that he just slept in oar arms all the
time. I washed him -with Cntlcnra
Soap and pat on one application of
Cuticura and he was so soothed that I
pot him in the cradle. You don't know
how glad I felt when he felt better.
It took one box of Cuticura Ointment,
pretty near one cake of Cutlcara Soap,
and about half a bottle of Cuticura Re-
solvent to cure. I think oar little boy
wonld hare died only for the Cuticura
Remedies, and I shall always remain a
firm friend of them."
