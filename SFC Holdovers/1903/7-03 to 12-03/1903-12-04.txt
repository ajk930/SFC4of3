â¢ROME, Dec. 3. â Going through the
financial matters of the Vatican as left
by Pope L^o. the' present . Pope found
that several millions had been em
ployed in res'toring the private patri
monies, of a number of aristocratic
.families the members, of which had re
mained faithful to the Holy See, par
ticularly those of r the Princess Bon
campagni and BorflUez. but more espe
cially the latter. The historic palace
of the latter, built by Pope Paul V at
the beginning of seventeenth century,
had fallen Into the hands of creditors
of the princely house; who rented It as
an office to the Grand Orient of the
Jtilian Free Masons, which Pope Leo
considered to be a desecration. All
rumors to tlie effect that Pope Pius in
tends to"* get. this money* back through
the application of coercive measures
are 1 considered at the Vatican as alto
-trler without foundation, because the
milles th.us subventioned are repay
ing the money loaned them by yearly
installments.
In the present case the girl has mo

she asks for her mother.
LONDON, Dec. 3.â In ; the London
Hospital there is a little girl with
typhoid fever who. is undergoing a
method of treatment which, it is said,
has been employed only once In the
history of that institution. For five
days past the patient, who is only five
years old, has been kept in a bath of
hot water. She lies on water. pillows
and her body is entirely under water,
which is kept at a' constant temper
ature of 101 degrees by an arrangement
of hot and cold water entering the mix
ing cistern, from which It Hows Into
the bath and thence out by e pipe.
In five days the child's temperature
has fallen from 105 to 103 degrees, but
the crisis has yet^to come. At least
three weeks must be spent in the bath
before -the disease can be shaken off.
It is said to be most unusual. to y find
a typhoid case necessitating this treat
ment. ; Some years ago, in the London
Hospital, a man was kept immersed
for six weeks and recovered.

OMAHA, * Nebr., : Dec. 3.â Somewhere
.between Seattle and this city, paintings
valued at- $200,0001 intended for exhibi
tion at the world's fair in St. Louis,
have been .lost or stolen.
, 'Charles R. Hall, the artist and owner
of the pictures, and the freight officials
of , the Union Pacific Railway, by which
they, were consigned, have given up the
possibility of finding them. The bill of
lading Is said by the railway men to be
a forgery. . .
Hall and a brother spent six years
travelfng . through America sketching
and painting -representative scenes.
Many were made. in Yellowstone Park,
others in the Adirondacks and many
more in the Rocky â¢ Mountains and
Alaska. ' The Hall brothers maintained
studios In Washington and Alaska,
where the paintings were finished. One
of the brothers, when" the "world's fair
was- undelrtaken,'- arranged with the
promoters "or directors to '. exhibit the
paintings,' many of which are already
sold r to Eastern art collectors.
. The. Halls came East in .September,
arranging with a firm in Seattle to ship
the ; pictures on, order. They. were sent

A manifesto issued Jointly to the

recites that the declarations of five ex-
Mlnlsters of War prove their belief
in the guilt of Dreyfus and warns. the
public that attempts will bo made to

or suppress witnesses and intimidate
the Judges. In conclusion th<: mani
festo appeals to the public to frustrate
the efforts of "the occult sects of in
ternationalists and the powers of cap
ital."
Mme. Zola, interviewed at Rome,
gives particulars of the dally life of
Dreyfus. She says he leaves} his house
only" on very rare occasions, not be
cause he ia^in any fear of insults, h-.u
for the reason that he suffers* terribly

ST. LOUIS, Dec. 3.â James L. Blair,
formerly general counsel of the Louisi
ana Purchase Exposition, was this aft
ernoon indicted by the Grand Jury on
a charge of forgery in* the first degree.
Blair has been ill for, several weeks iri
a local hospital, and for a time his life
was despaired of.
" The indictment Is , the result of
charges filed by James T. Roberts, an
attorney at one time' employed In
Blair's office. Roberts procured certain
papers and records, on which he after
ward based his charges that Blair was
juggling the finances of large estates
committed to his trust. Roberts pub
licly charged that Blair had forged
deeds of trust and mortgages on which
$63,000 was obtained from the estate of
the late Peter Blow of" St. Louis, and
that he had counterfeited and used no
tarial seals of the Recorder of Deeds of
St. Louis, and frequently employed
"Walter F. Jenkins," a purely fictitious
personage, to attest the documents.
Blair characterized Roberts' accusa
tions as a "tissue of falsehood, woven
around a few grains of fact.!'
DICKS DEFY THE COURTS.
Blair acted as a sort of fiscal and in
vestment agent Â¦ for the' firm of -Dick
Brothers "of Philadelphia: and "New
York. Evans II. Dick, the head of the
firm, was cotrustee Â¦ .with- Edward j S.
Robert in the Blow estate. \ . ;. ,
The Grand Jury requested â¢ the Dicks
and their attorney, to come, to St. -Louis
to testify, but they ignored the sum
mons. Â¦ Â¦Â¦ ' : - â¢ - - '-.-.,
Following the Blair expose, Mrs.
Blair, who was chairman ! of the board
of lady managers of the fair,- resigned
her position, and since then the Blairs
have sold their costly, home and she has
disposed of her jewels and her -fine
stable of horses. â¢ v ' -' -
BASED ON ALLEGED FORGERIES.
Each indictment: is *based on' the y al
leged forgery by, Blair of ; a deed} of
trust to secure a loan from .the 7 estate
of Peter Blow of St. Louis, 1 of which" he,
as a trustee, had charge; One indict
ment alleges that on December 10, 1896,
Blair filed" for record -a forged ? deed in
favor of Michael O'Laughllri and his
wife, Johanna; \ to . Louisa "Â¦; Meyer for
$12,000. Note's "and property near' Four

for $60,000 in favor of Elizabeth and
John Dwyer and the St. Louis Trust
Company, their agent, to Otto M. Mes 7
mer. It covered eleven notes, and prop
erty at Seventh and , Pine streets. , The
indictments also charge Blair with for
gery of . the seal .of -the' St. j Louis [ Re
corder of Deeds. -The indictmentswere

IN DREYFUS CASE
Only by good luck was it that both
submarines were not In the same pre
dicament. For a time both had been
washed adrift from the line by which
the Government tug Peoria was towing
them from Newport to the naval sta
tion at Annapolis, Md. After desperate
exertion the men on the tug managed
to pick up one of thÂ« submarines
(which one cannot be ascertained to
night) and headed at once for Norfolk.
The first that was known that, the
torpedo boats were in any diljlculty was
when the United States Weather Bu
reau station In Norfolk received this
dispatch over its wire from the coast:
"Tug supposed to be Pe'oria and two
torpedo boats are in distress off Lttla
Island."
This Information waa communicated
to Rear Admiral P. F. Harrington, who
is In command of the Norfolk navy
yard,' and he at once sent the auxiliary
gunboat Yankton . to Little Island,
which is about twenty miles south of
.Virginia Beach, under the command of
Lieutenant G. W. Williams. The Yank
ton left the navy-yard at 1 o'clock this
afternoon and four hours later she was
reported as having passed False Cape.
That the torpedo boats are the Adder
and the Moccasin there can be ho
doubt. In tow of the navy tug Peoria
they left Newport, R. I... where they
had been all summer engaged in Im
portant maneuvers, to go to Annapolis.
In command of both vessels was
Lieutenant Frank L. Plnney. but the
crew of each boat was aboard the Peo
ria, and neither submarine was
manned.
CAPE HENRY, Va., Dec 3.â Without
a person aboard one of the fastest two
submarine torpedo boats in the world,
either the Adder or the Moccasin, of
the United States navy, lies stranded
on a bar four miles south of Currituck
life-saving station to-night. Ready to
do what they may to save her, but de
terred by a very heavy sea, which is
lashed to a fury by a northwest gale,
life-savers are upon the beach waiting
for a favorable opportunity to reach

POPE EXAMINES

â¢ is -.lo" act as umpire. Regular sessions
will soon begin.
This company assumed part of the
Dominican debt and wae given impor
tant port concessions and the right to
.collect certain revenues. When these
at -once brought large claims against
the Dominican Government. A treaty
tvajs negotiated providing for reference
of Â¦ the case to arbitration. General
Jiminez, the revolutionary leader who
overthrew Wos y Gil, g.ave notice that
Â¦ he. would respect no agreements made
by; that President. United States Min
ister Powell, at San Domingo City, ac
cordingly has only entered into rela
tions with the new administration, but
has not recognized it fully as yet.
* The State- Department holds that
.whatever administration is in power in
Banto Domingo it must respect the ar
bitration treaty in this case and must
ffcdde by the decision of the arbitra
tors.- Should it refuse to do so, the
United States will have plenty of cause
to; interfere to enforce the collection of
thf award. . ; V '
The necessity for some such action
Is fcrid to be more apparent every day.
Reports came to the State Department
to-day that another revolution was be
-ing fomented, this time against Gen
eral Jimlnez.. There haB been no an
nouncement by the administration of
any intention of establishing a protec

course has been strongly urged as the
only way to Insure the safety of for

The market- closed strong at: nearly
the top, with prices net 6 9; to 74 points
higher. Sales were estimated at
2,000,000 bales, exceeding for this sea
son anything recorded.
The volume of business was so
great, and the excitement so intense
that the brokers were on. the verge of
collapse, '.the maximum; advance.rep

from $3 .'to "', $3,50 -per" bale, and ; the

BROKERS 'ARE EXHAUSTED!
Up to 11 o'clock there was much ex
citement on the. floor and the trading
of the day was greater than 1 on any
preceding day in the history of the
exchange. Fortunes were made or
lost within the first four minutes.
The traders who had sold short made
frantic efforts to cover in the first few
minutes. Some succeeded in getting
under cover before the price had ad
vanced too far, but there were few so
fortunate, for in the first three min
utes the figures in March options ad
vanced 34 points and at the end of
eight minutes the prices had advanced
59 points and March was quoted at
12.50 cents. Other months made tre
mendous jumps, January going up 34
points in five and one-quarter min
utes. . '
Eight minutes after the report was
read the market received the first
j check. The rise on March suddenly
stopped at 12.50 and the next sale
was 7 points lower.v The bears made
great efforts to keep the price down,
but the bull movement was irresistible
and a few minifies later prices were
again on the. boom.
HEAVIEST SALES ON RECORD.
NEW YORK, Dec. 3.â An unprece
dented rush to buy, a sensational
soaring of prices upward and the
heaviest sales on record followed the
announcement on the New York Cot
ton Exchange of the Agricultural De
partment's estimate of the cotton
crop for the present season, .9,982,039
bales. At the sound of the word
"nine," indicating the; number of mil
lion bales in the estimate, a scene of
frantic bidding set in, the shorts In
their excitement not waiting to learn
that the total estimate was but 37,961
bales short of the round 10,000,000.
Instantaneously prices jumped from
10 to 20 points on the first sales, the
rise continuing until advances of from
30 to 40 points were registered before
the close of an hour, and of from 60
to 70 points before the upward move
ment was checked.
Then the uncovering of "long" cot
ton in tremendous volume with the
advance and the realization that the
estimate was practically 10,000,000
bales "caused a temporary, reaction;
but soon an v outpouring of buying or
ders from outside markets and bullish
reports sent prices upward again and
afthe high point, reached shortly be
fore the close, December sold at 1 2. 3 2
cents, January at 12.46c, March ; at
12.59c;' May, at, 12.57c, and July at
12.56c, or 79 to 87 points above the
low level, of the morning.
FOBTX7NES MADE OR LOST.
From the Highest level there was an
Immediate and wide recession, under
heavy profit-taking. The recession
was of short duration and was fol
lowed by another upward movement,
which carried prices skyward. Trad
ers could hardly appreciate the bull
ishness of the estimate when It ap
peared in large figures on a black
board held over the ring by one of
the exchange employes. In a few sec
onds the ring was full of wildly wav
ing arms, rwhlle hats went up into the
air* and the shouting was heard for
blocks; In ;their enthusiasm .bulls pre-
Eervative members, however, thought
15 cents was high enough for some
time to come.
NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 3.â This was
the wildest day ever seen In the cot
ton market. The bureau estimate at
11 o'clock of 9,962,039 bales for this sea
son's crop sent prices up from 90 to 91
points above yesterday's closing fig
ures. The confusion was to great that
difficulty was had in making accurate
trades, and it was fully two minutes
after the estimate was read before
quotations were posted. Within four
minutes prices advanced 40 points. The
advance was steady until March stood
60 points higher than the last quota
tions before the reading of the esti
mate. â¢ ,

NEW TORK, Dec. 3â Fifteen hun
dred steerage passengers sailed on the
White Star liner Cedric, which left here
yesterday for Liverpool. This is the
largest" number of steerage passengers
ever carried from a United States port
on any steamer. The French line
steamer La Touralne, which sailed to
day, carried 1000 steerage [ passengers,
and it was estimated that more than
200 steerage passengers with tickets
were left on the dock owing to the
overselling of accommodations. Â¦ Â¦'
For several months the number of
steerage passengers on all outgoing
steamship lines has been very heavy,
and it is thought that many laborers,
especially Italians, having been able to
accumulate what is to them a compe
tency, are returning to their native
lands. On the steamer Neckar, ' which
sailed to-day for Bremen, were 1013
steerage passengers. It i Is estimated
that about 9000 steerage passengers
have left this port in the last week for
their old homes. They have come from

LOS ANGELES. Dec. 3.â When Amos
Hercules walked into the electric rail
road car shops yesterday, morning
with a revolver in each hand and be
gan firing into the crowd of workmen
he was carrying out a carefully ar
ranged â¢ plan to murder seven men
against whom he had a fancied griev
ance. That he succeeded in killing
but one, Timothy Segrue. is du.e to the
prompt action of. Foreman Peter
Brown, who seized and disarmed the
desperate young man.
Hercules' written plan to murder the
seven men employed ln the shops was
found in his room at Redondo to-day,
when search was made by the author
ities. The statement of his Intentions
to kill all the men whose gibes had an
gered him and then to commit suicide
was fully explained. A document which
was intended as his will was also
found. Those whom he had marked
for death were Timothy Segrue, O. T. â¢
Clutter, Peter Brown, J. Peterson, L.
J. Perry, A. Longstreet ' and L. B.
Pemberton.
After making disposition of his be
longings in his will, Hercules request
ed that part of his money be used to
bury him: He then continues as fol
lows - '\ ';Â¦*
"After I commit the crime I know
my doom. I will have no one else ex
, cept the ones who have done me
wrong. I Intend, to kill them alL"
He then enumerated a number of
men other than the seven shop em
ployes. Several times in his state
ment he reiterates the determination
not to be taken alive.
A Coroner's jury returned a verdict
this afternoon charging Hercules with
the premeditated murder of Timothy
Segrue and holding him without bond.

ANTI-CHRISTIAN
RISING IN CHINA
RINCON, N. Mex., Dec. 3.â Reports
of fabulous finds in the newly discov
ered gold fields are coming into this
town. The wildest of unverified reports
are daily brought here. Prospectors
and adventurers come in on every train
and others are journeying to the new
El Dorado by wagon and afoot.
A Mexican came In to-night with a
bottle containing seven' nuggets of va
rious sizes, the whole amount aggre
gating a value of perhaps $60.
. Louis Galles of Albuquerque, one of
the best-known men ln the Territory,
arrived here to-night and says the ex
tent of the great discovery has not been
exaggerated. Galles has with him a
bottle of coarse gold. This precious
metal he gleaned out of a handful of
sand that he casually scooped up. Blow
ing the dirt and debris out of the mass,
he found gold to the value of approx
imately $5. The ever-accompanying
mining camp adjunct, a saloon, has al
ready been 'established ln the gold
fields.' Gamblers, of course, will not
come until the camp attains a more
stable status. The "find" so far is six
miles long and three miles wide. Many
here estimate the number of men in the
gold fields at 1000. Galles conserva
tively estimates the number, however,
at 400. No killings have yet .occurred
in the new camp, although it is ex
pected that trouble will develop when
some of the more enterprising claim
takers are compelled to share their
holdings with the new-comers. Many
are endeavoring to hold more than they
are entitled to. Prospectors are enter
ing tha country from Hillsboro, Hatch,
El Paso, Albuquerque and all sur
rounding towns.

The walls of some are merely strips
of tarred paper nailed on wooden
frames. Other houses are simply tents
made of * canvas. Not a few are par
tially constructed ) of earth, something
after the fashion of a dugout. A 1 shovel
ful of coal or b. dozen or two, sticks of
wood comprised the entire visible -fuel
supply of mosf of the residents,- from
whom Dowie is "demanding; $500,000.

some -of these enthusiasts been driven
that instead J of chopping down â¢;. trees
they dig them up : by . the roots so -as to
have additional fuel. : ;
Whether Dowie's home, Shlloh House,
is connected with the administration
building, 200 feet away, by an under
ground tunnel is a question that is puz
zling Chief Custodian Redieske. Dowie
had an appointment with Redieske,
and while the custodian was standing
nt the door of the administration build
ing waiting for Dowie to appear he was
notified that Dowie was awaiting him
inside.
Dowie kept another appointment to
day in the same mysterious manner,
and then Redieske came to the conclu
sion that Dowie must have an under
ground passage between the two build
ings. Not once since the receivers
seized Zion City has its 'founder been
seen outside the doors, yet he has held
conferences both at his home and at
the administration building. Â¦
Investigations to-day show that the
fuel supply of many families in Zion
City is reduced almost to nothing. The
extent to which the people of Zion City,
have beggared themselves is shown* by
a trip through the, town. Many of the
poorer residents, the men and women
who work ln ; the factories, live ln

DOWIE A MAN OF MYSTERY.
CHICAGO, Dec. 3.â John Alexander
Dowie will be called to the' Â¦'witness
stand before Bankruptcy Referee Sid
ney C. Eastman and, under oath, will
be required to answer all questions
regarding the financial' affairs of Zion
City. While the date for the inquiry
has not yet been set, Judge Kohlsaat
this afternoon entered the order,
which requires the overseer of the
Christian Catholic church to submit
to an examination." This action was
taken on motion of Attorney Samuel
Ettelson, who files the original peti
tion in bankruptcy against Dowle.
"This application' was not made for
the purpose of harassing Dr. Dowie,"
said Attorney Ettelson. "The receiv
ers are making Â» an investigation of
Dowie's accounts and they undoubt
edly will need his testimony to get a
correct " knowledge of his financial
condition. It is for this purpose that
Dowie will be called to the stand. The
date of this examination will be set
as soon as the receivers have decided
what <hey want : to question him
about." : ; r i\r-;
LITTXE COIN" 'IN THE BANKS.
Receivers Blount'and Currier spent
most of the day at Zion City looking
into accounts which they could find,
so that they might prepare the report
which Judge Kohlsaat has asked for
concerning the advisability of contin
uing the operation . of all industries
belonging to Dow ; ie. The receivers, it
was said to-night, have found only
about $12,000 in both of Dowie's
banks. Judge Kohlsaat has told the
receivers that he wants to know as
soon as possible whether the interests
of all creditors - cannot be protected
best by continuing the various enter
prises in Zion City. It is not likely
that any of the industries will be
closed, as in such an event thousands
of persons in Zion City would be de
prived of a means of livelihood. This
is said to be one of the main reasons
Dowle will be retained as manager of
the business, under the direction of
the receivers. The . receivers realize
Dowie's strong hold upon his follow
ers and wish to prevent any turn of
events which might turn Zion City,
into a deserted village.
FACTORIES ABE NOT PAYING.
That Zion City's . two chief indus
tries â the lace works and the candy
factor}* â are not paying expenses was
officially disclosed to-day In an ex
amination of the plants by Chief Cus
todian Redieske. After questioning
â¢closely the managers of both concerns
Redieske said: . . . - ,
"If Dowie relies on '.the industries
of Zion City to pay his indebtedness
the town will still be ln the hands of
receivers a year from now. Neither
the lace works nor the candy factory
Is on a paying basis. In the case of
j the lace works, I understand lack of
i raw material is to blame. No one
i seems to know -what is the. matter
i'with the candy factory."
Redieske is now skeptical concerning
Dowie's ability to vacate the receiver
ship.
"Dowie may have a million or two up
j his sleeve, for all I know," he said, "but
! I have been unable to see any evidence
I of financial strength in Zion City."
â¢ This afternoon Judge Kohlsaat or-
I dered that all coupons issued by Dowie
to laborers and wage earners in Zion
City outstanding before December 1
should be accepted at the discretion of
the receivers.
"Loud and prolonged cheering greeted
the " speaker's last- words, and ,ihe :
crowd , swarmed around to shake hi3
hand. . < . . v'Hv'i
State Labor Commissioner Montgom
ery has arranged a conference with
Mitchell and Governor Peabody atthe

Mitchell to-day, citing him to appear
in court within thirty days to answer
a suit for damages in the sum of $85,
000 brought by the Victor Fuel Com
pany against the United Mine Workers
of America, its president, vice president
and all officers and organizers on-, na
tional and district boards," alleging
$50,000 loss in profits, $25,000 .paid, out
for guards and other damages to the
amount'of $10,000.
This afternoon President Mitchell re
ceived word from Hastings that the
Victor Fuel Company was tearing
down the houses of the men there.
These houses are owned by the men,
but are built on the' land of the fuel
company, and the miners pay for the
use of the ground. The houses are be
ing torn down over the heads of the
families. Steps will be taken at once
to start criminal and civil proceedings
against the company.
TRINIDAD, Colo., Dec. 3.â With the
temperature at" the freezing point
President Mitchell addressed a crowd
estimated at between 4000 and 5000 in
the open air this afternoon. The crowd
shivered from cold, but listened atten
tively throughout, frequently lnte'rrfa'pt*
ing the speaker with cheers. Mitchell
spoke -from a platform decorated with
bunting and flags. He was blue from
cold at the conclusion. ". Mitchell said:, :
- "I cannot tell when or how the strike
will end, whether in a day, a month or
a yearâ that depends on yourselves.'
You cannot hope to win without mak-;
ing sacrifices. I have been in ; many
strikes and seen starvation and evic
tion. Strikes are serious things,- not
pleasures, and men must strike brave
ly. An organization that has won iVic-'
tories in great Pennsylvania strikes
cannot be driven from Colorado.' Our
organization is 380,000 strongâ too
strong to be beaten in this State."; v If
you are of the same mind as I am you
will mine no more coal till you receive
fair compensation under proper condi-:
tions." You should all obey the law, add'
this a good union man will do. You
must fight peaceably. Be peaceable arid
law-abiding, and strike, strike, strike:
until you win."

Another is that an attempt vas made

Senator Knowland said that many
thousands of dollars had been expended
in keeping the thoroughfare in passa
ble condition, but with little success.
He asserted that the realty along the
roadway would not stand the assess
ment that would be necessary to raise
the funds required to make the high
way "what it should be. Senator
Knowland explained that there is no
law under which the county can be
called upon to assist in improvements
within a municipality. He considered
that the best plan would be for the
mercantile and improvement organi
zations of Alameda and Oakland to
join in raising funds by subscription
or otherwise to keep the roadway In
condition for traffic. He did not be
lieve that an election for bonds to carry
out the work would succeed.
Assemblyman Bates said the Web
ster street roadway was a disgrace to
Alameda and announced that he would
work in every way to devise a plan for
its improvement.
Secretary Stearns said that the Oak
land Board of Trade stood ready to
help Alameda rebuild the roadway, as
its improvement would redound to the
benefit of both cities. It was decided
that the West End Improvement Asso
ciation "would meet December 17 Inst.
with a committee from the Oakland
Board of Trade, when it is expected a
definite plan of procedure will be out
lined. : ;r:;

Fire caused by ignition and explosic/n
of gas in a blast pipe wrecked the "Sta
tion B" plant of the' Oakland Gas,
Light and Heat Company at First and
Brush streets, shortly. after. 2 o'clock
this mornmgr Tfhe flames broke'out In
the engine-room and attacked . the
frame roof, rapldiy spreading, gutting
the brick structure and threatening the
large gasometer east of the building.
Fortunately the firemen kept the fire
confined to the building and prevented
a disastrous explosion at the gas tanks.
Engineer George W. Bennett and his
assistant, J. Mansfield, were slightly
burned in their fight to control the fire.
The boilers and gas manufacturing
equipment were badly damaged, but
can be made serviceable by repairs. E.
C. Jones, engineer in charge of the gas
department of the works, began to
clear the wreckage this morning and he
said gas making at the station would
be resumed by to-morrow.
When the fxplosion came Engineer
Bennett was thrown against a brick
wall by the force of the concussion, but
escaped serious injury. He kept at
work battling with the encroaching
flames until the firemen arrived in re
sponse to a single alarm.
In* the burned building was a meter
department, which suffered $10,000 loss
from destroyed apparatus. The loss to
the building and machinery is about
$30,000, covered by insurance.
John A. Britton, manager of the com
pany, said to-day#that the supply of
gas would not be diminished, as "Sta
tion A," Second , and Washington
streets, would furnish ample iluid. <The
property burned was erected by the
Equitable Gas Company, which was
absorbed by the Oakland Gas, Light
and Heat Company, " that corporation
merging recently with' the California
Gas and Electric Corporation.

Because- John Smith, a burglar sen
tenced to San Quentin for twenty years,
had a considerable supply of opium In
his possession when he came to be re
moved from the County Jail to-day.
Sheriff Bishop has issued an order that
the visiting days at the prison will be
cut down to "Wednesdays and Satur
days, and that nothing in the way of
-food will be allowed to be brought from
the outside to those confined in the jail.
Owing to the number of Chinese that
have been held here for the Federal
Government, there has been an unusual
demand for opium in the jail and the
most rigid watch has failed to keep the
stuff from the prisoners. The Sheriff
has come to the conclusion that most of
It ha's been brought in with the cakes
and pies sent in to the prisoners. /
A large potato was found in the jail
yard one day, the inside filled with
opium, and Lee Bang, a Chinese, is
now doing' a year at San Quentin for
attempting to give some cigars filled
with the drug to a prisoner.
Now there are to be no more cakes
and pies and the jail is to become less
of a home and more of a prison.

In the Flr3t Presbyterian Church in

lowing call to those interested:
OAKLAND. Cal.. Dec. 2. 19<tt.
To the Christian People of Oakland â Dear
Friends: The Alameda County Christian En
deavorers and Epworth Leaguers have shown a
generous and missionary spirit in merging
their county conventions, together with thÂ«
Baptist Youns People's L'nion. Into one large
interdenominational young people"s missionary
conference, which begins Its thr^Â« days' Â«es
vions In the First Presbyterian Church. Oak
land, on Friday morning. â¢ The executive com
mittee hereby Issues a call to you to invtta
ycur co-operation In an effort to- make this
meeting memorable and powerful. .Ifce need*
and the justifications are round in the follow-
Irg facts: . . â¢
Klfst â Our "marching; orders" are plain; Â»Â«r
common Master has spoken clearly. . lie does
not suggest or advise a world wide, preaching
of the gospel. He. commands it. His definite
instructions are found in all four gospels and
In the Book of Acts. Hta programme must be
ours. He says: '"Go preach to every creature;'
teach all nations." For every true believer
this Is enough, an unanswerable argument, an
uftimatum. It la hish time to obey or- deny
hi.* Tight to command. We must repudiate
him. reject his gospel, or leap forward In glad
and Immediate response. Let us undertake to
evangelize every creature now, to reach out
own generation, or elsÂ« be honest enough to
confess that we have no Intention of doing so.
We must quit him or quit foolinff with mis
sions. If Jesus knew his business,.' our busi
ness Is to carry oqt hta order. If he did not
let us eeast* to follow him. Forty cents a
year Is the average gift of American Chris
tians, while two-thirds of the world have never
heard bis name. Our spirit la wrong,' cur at
titude sinful, our neglect criminal. Let Â«Â¦ rÂ»*
pent.
Second â This conference, makes no faJaÂ» dis
tinctions about "Home or Foreign." but caila
on all believers in Christ to help siak* hli
gospel known to all men everywhere. God has
no foreigners. Which Is his country? Wher*
does his sun shine? Shall the "fatherhood of
God" be merely a dogma, and Â«thÂ« "brother
hood of man" be made a farce? : *,. -â¢
Third â Eleven denominations and sÂ«veral or
ganizations are represented on the programs!*
and we shall know no name but Christian. All
wtll be tirged to work through their ' own
boards. Hay there be sweet fellowship m wÂ».
who are one in Christ, wait together witn on*
accord In one place and seek to know and to
do cur Master's will. Then "I Â«m wjtlÂ» you"
will have new meaning.
Fourtli â The programme la broad, spiritual
and dynamic. It begin* with Important sub
jects and strong speakers. Friday morning n.n
fact will be developed that from Oenest* to
Kevelatlons the Bible teachea missions. Sub
jects are announced rather than speakers, -ta
order to emphasise truth and not men. "not

measure with the City Trustees at
their meeting next .Monday night with
the request that it be passed as quickly
as circumstances will permit. Those

KEVIEWS THE FUTURE.
Bishop Hamilton reviewed the relig
ious and spiritual future c-f San Fran-Â»
<isco and assured his hearers that he
heartily eo-operated with them in their
plans. This, he said, was a day of great
thing?, of great thought and move
ments and achievements', and, he said,
there was nevor a time when even the
ambition of writers was to make more
nf the Jiu!p things of life, to illumine
them in rhrmeht and in sympathy. In
this ftgrp they were all profoundly stir
red by teachings and a rympathetic
Ftory, he held, even touched the whole
people.
Bishop Hamilton fold his : interested
audience that he brought to them
greeting* from the great annual gath
erings now being held beyond the Mis
sissippi, and so far as the influence of

concerned he said that they had pever

greatness until the ceremonies attend
ing' the centcnery of Wesley when

they had never dared speak of them
selves. He Â¦ made the statement that
the offerings of the missionary societies

BARS LUXURIES
AT COUNTY JAIL
FRESNO, Dec. 3.â Antone Mattos, a
well-to-do Italian farmer, assaulted- his
wife to-day at the Pacific Coast Pack
ing-house and threw, a powder in her
face with the alleged intention of
blinding her. The assault was made in
the presence of a big crowd of people
just at the noon hour at the packing
house. By good fortune only a little of
the powder struck her in the face and
she was' injured very slightly. 'Mattos
denies there was anything in the paper
he threw at his wife at all.
Several months ago Mattos' wife
called in the aid of officers to protect
her from the assaults of her husband,
who was beating her and threatening
to kill her. The trouble was adjusted
at that time, but the next night he
again attacked her and neighbors in
terfered and beat him severely.
_ Mrs. Mattos finding herself unable to
"endure his'cruelty left him, and she and
her children have since earned their
'own- living In the 'packing-houses by
hard labor. She began suit for divorce
several weeks, ago. According to the
eldest daughter Mattos went to the
packing-house purposely to quarrel
with his wife this. morning. The daugh
ter herself swore to a warrant for her
father's arrest, charging him simply
with disturbing the peace.

"Chief of Police."
'To the Honorable Board of Police
and Fire Commissioners of the City of
Oakland. Cal.â Gentlemen: I deeply re-
Bret having to report to your honorable
body the death of regular Police Officer
James H. Smith, who died November
21, 1903. Officer Smith was one of ten
officers detailed in citizen's clothes to
patrol the Lakeside district, with in
structions to arrest all suspicious char
acters whom he might meet.
"On the evening of Friday, Novem
ber 27, he met at Fourteenth and Jack
son streets two strangers, whom he ac
costed. Upon being questioned they
failed to answer him satisfactorily. He
told them they must go with him to
police headquarters. Immediately one
of them (David Kiniry) him. The
courageous officer then showed his
heroism by nobly standing his ground,
and although mortally wounded shot
and killed the 'pal* of the burglar who
shot him.
. The police have no information con
cerning the whereabouts of David
Kiniry, the murderer of Patrolman
James H. Smith. On this the sixth
day after the shooting the police say
they have not landed a clew nor a
(race to the fugitive. The best the de
partment had to offer to-day was evi
dence that Kiniry and his dead com
panion, Frank Goldctein, had nob con
fined their b'urglarious operations to
Oakland.
Among the odds and ends left behind
in the room occupied by Kiniry at the
Steadman residence, 1362 Grove street,
were a lot of silver half-dimes and a
heavy gold pocket pencil. The former
have been identified by J. B. Miller,
whose residence, 1346 McAllister street,
San Francisco, was ransacked the night
of October 16. W. Wolfe, residing at
1312 Washington street, San Francisco,
has identified the pencil as among the
plunder that burglars carried from his
home five or six weeks ago.
This convinces the police that the
pair were active in their criminal move
ments and equally speedy in disposing
of their loot. That Kiniry got the ma
jor portion of the proceeds is also a po
lice theory.
The Board of Police and Fire Com
missioners has born officially advised
of the death of Policeman Smith by
the following communication from the
Chief of Police:

"Thls system of education wisely ad
ministered is In my judgment the final
cause of American manhood. But if
we are going to 4 . have high walls built

our independence and character has
been secured, then our system will be
absolutely useless. The purpose of edu
cation is to equip us with those ele
ments of thrift and economy and en
ergy that. will fit us for a battle with

"But we can't do- this thing altogether
in the universities. We must begin In
the lower schools. And unless we begin
early and stimulate the youth of tlxlm
generation there will surely, be a de

our empire, and it will be signalized by
the withdrawal of opportunities for
young men and the overcrowding of
the professions and trades.
"Now, I believe in higher education.
I hear some people say that the univer
sity is seeking to establish an arrs^
tocracy of learning. But* I would have
this understoodâ that all occupations
are honorable. It is not for us to sneer
at them, let them be what they may.
I believe in this university because it
teaches men honorable laborâ to go

the soil, but not on the Greek roots.
"There are a good many sentimental
obstacles put in the way of the educa
tion of the American youth nowadays.
The time was when we were proud of
men who sprang from .the L hardy occu
pation's, which built up that character
that gave them leadership. Those men
were the men of their time. They had
the saving quality of what is some
times called 'horse sense.' There were
never any classes in those days. It was
never intended that, there uhould be
any classification of American citizens.
This modern idea of class was import
ed from Europe. You can't pick up a
paper now but that you see something
about the demands of labor, as if labor
is the only one of the classes. I've ob-"
served this about these classesâ that
there is a Bet determination to prevent
a man from escaping them. That's
wh..t is going to impair our American
ingenuity and enterprise unless philoso
phy and common sense come to our
rescue. We don't want any class un
less it be the noble.

Mrs. Muir, the professional fortune
teller, whose husband was incarcerated
for assaulting a policeman whom she
had enlisted to protect her from him,
informed Judge Cabaniss yesterday
that she suspected her spouse is of un
sound mind. To find out whether her
suspicion Is correct or unfounded, his
Honor continued the case against Muir
until this morning.
"When Judge Cabaniss was Informed
of Mrs. Mulr*s occupation he expressed
surprise that a lady of her putative
power to analyze the human thinking
apparatus should be at all doubtful of
the mental condition of a person to
whom she is so closely related as the
defendant.
"She only suspects he is insane," said
the JudeTe. "Now, in my opinion . an

In duty bound to hearken to his com

But when McDonald appeared in the

morning he was duly sober and sorry
that he had accused Conroy of such a
serious offense as grand larceny. "I'm

With his good name thus unequivo

Miss Florence Porter occupied an
apartment at the Havana until her
mother, Mrs. Margaret Rice, returned
from a visit to Tacozna, and when
Mrs. Rice went to get her daughter's
trunk and have it removed to her own
dwelling she was informed that the
receptacle would not be given up until
a certain damaged bed was paid
for. Mrs. Rice applied for an order of
court compelling release of the trunk,
and a special attorney retained by the
hotel folk opposed the application on
the ground that the rules and regula
tions of the hostelry, which are con
spicuously posted in oach room, spe
cifically and emphatically state that all
property injured by tenants must be
paid for by them, and that in default
of such payment the baggage of the
person Involved will be held.
Then the court produced the Civil
Code of California and proved by quot
ing one of its provisions relating to
rights of landlords and tenants that thi*
rules and regulations of the Havana
Hotel conflicted with the letter and
spirit thereof. Whereupon the order of
release was issued to Mrs. Rice.
There was a clash of authorities In
Judge Cabaniss' court that resulted in
the triumphant vindication of the Cali
fornia Statutes as conflicting with the
codified rules and regulations of the
Havana Hotel on Mission street.

"How did you happen to see him the
second time?" inquired the court, gaz
ing in awe at Henry's jet visage.
"I didn't see him," was the reply; "I
heard him snore."
Henry was given back 520 of his ball
money.
When the case of Henry Brown,
charged with drunkenness,- was called
in Mogan's court there was no response
from the defendant, and when his
Honor was Informed that Henry was
a colored soldier and had deposited 525
as bail for his appearance there was
expression of wonder as to where he
could be.
"See if you can find him. Mr. Bailiff,"
said the Judge, "for I don't think he
would willfully forfeit $25 rather than
face trial for simple drunk."
A few minutes later Henry entered
the courtroom under escort, and his
complexion substantiated the explana
tion of his non-appearance when first
called.
"He was asleep in a corner of a cell
in which the light Is rather dim," said
the court officer, "and he is to black
that I did not see him the first time I
peered into the cell."
"What do you break glass for?",elic
ited no answer from the woman, but
when asked how long she had been im
prisoned for her last offense, she
promptly rerlied "Six months."
'Then take six more." said the Judge,
and she was led away to take them.
Emma Miller was both frowzled and
defiant as she loomed before Judge
Conlan and heard a charge of willful
destruction of property read by the
clerk. The complaint stated that she
had maliciously smashed two panes of
plate glass and two large glass globes
in the window of Gates' drug store at
New Montgnmery and Howard streets.
"You have been punished for window
smashing before, have you not?" in
quired the Court.
"Yes," was Emma's sullen reply.
In defense of his markmanship, Komi
stated that Just as he Jerked the trig
ger the dog obtruded its carcass be
tween the muzzle of his rifle and a
target at which he was aiming and that
he had no intention of killing the ani
mal. On the other hand, it was shown
that unless Komi could not hit a barn
door at ten paces he could not acciden
tally have shot the dog.
The court took the prosecution's view
of the question of intent, and Komi will
be sentenced to-day.
Miss Grace Vaughan's pet spaniel.,
nine months old and pretty as a pic
ture, ranÂ»into a Grant-avenue shooting
gallery Wednesday afternoon and while
prowling around between the butts and
the targets received a bullet from a
rifle In the hands of K. Komi, a Jap
anese youth, who proudly proclaimed
to all whom it might concern In Judge
Mogan's courtroom that he was a
Christian. The shot was fatal, and
Miss Vaughan had Komi arrested be

aimed at her net.

of the affair to-night,' said:
SALE OF THE DRUG.
Opium has been smuggled into San
Quentin for many years and only a
short time ago a large quantity was
confiscated. Yesterday, however, it
was discovered that over fifty ounces
had been smuggled inside the walls
within the past few weeks. From a
rigid examination by Warden Tomp
kins and the far-reaching investigation
of Captain Russell five inmates were
suspected. Through facts thus gleaned
Captain Harrison of the yard was en
abled to locate some of the "dope" in
the cell of Hernandez. Warden Tomp
kins then took up the matter person
ally and not only obtained the opium
but discovered a large knife secreted
in Hernandez's mattress. '
By this damaging evidence and by
other means Hernandez was made to
confess. He told how much opium had
been distributed, where it had been ob
tained and all other minor details of
the crime! Hernandez .1 would not
"peach" on his confederates,, yet the
following facts have" come to â¢ light:
Hernandez, Gonzales and Baconora be
long to the road gang of convicts who
are engaged in building a road near
Greenbrae. About - two weeks ago,
while the gang of twenty were at din
ner, Baconora found under the table a
box containing five two-ounce tobacco
sacks. He told Hernandez of the find,
but Hernandez told him to keep still.
Later he made a compact whereby Ba
conora was to hide two sacks, Gonzales
two sacks and he (Hernandez) one.
The sacks were hidden In their shirts
until they passed "search guards" at
the prison gates.
"DOPE" IN THE CELLS.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec 3.â The opium
industry which has flourished in San
Quentin prison for the past several
months Is about to be materially cur
tailed, if not absolutely abolished.
Through the untiring efforts of War
den Tompkins, Captain Russell and
some of the others, the ring leaders of
a gang which has been earning on
the business have been found out. As
a result, this afternoon three of the
men were arrested and will be tried
on felony charges.
The three who must stand trial are
Aloysius Hernandez, R. M. Gonzales
and Manuel Baconora, three Mexicans.
The real arch conspirator of the gang
is Jack Ortega, the' prize fighter, who
is doing a life term in prison. Ortega,
however, owing to his having to wear
prison garb for life, will not be tried,
yet he will in no way be exempt from
punishment. He is at present in a
dungeon and will most probably be
sentenced to remain the balance of his
days in Incorrigible cells.

Mary Xeustader, a dashing young
woman, who informed the court that
she resides on Bush street and has no
settled occupation, went -a-slumming
in the vicinity of Fourth and Folsom
streets with several casual male ac
quaintances night before last, and after
the party had visited five saloons and
partaken freely of liquid refreshments
Miss Neustader was in such a hilarious
condition that a policeman considered
her arrest essential to the preservation
of peace. She was in a penitent mood
as she faced Judge Mogan yesterday
morning, and said that she did not
know the name of a single one of her
roystering "gentlemen friends" and had
never seen any of them until they met
her on Sutter street and cordially in
vited her to accompany them. :
As It was the woman's first appear

of caution as to how she should ireat

If the handwriting: on the wall In
an empty upper flat numbered 60 Wal
ler street can be positively identified
as that of Mrs. William Weissgerber,
who recently occupied the premises,
that lady Is likely to be punished for
malicious mischief. She was before Po
lice Judge Fritz yesterday morning on
complant of V. Simi, an Italian, who
owns the flat in auestion and dwells
in the one underneath it, and tha bur
dan of his grievance was that she, in
retaliation for having her rent raised
by him. penciled libelous legends on
the Interior walls and then movei out.
Among the Inscriptions alleged by Sig
ner Elml were:
"This Is a cold house."
"Beware af rats and mice and the
dago downstairs."
"Dcn't rent this house. The daga will
drive you to the booby hatch."
"This is a bum joint."
"The house is full of rats and mice
and jrarlic and dagoes."
All of which. Signor Siml averred,
were written with Intent to damage
him pecuniarily by scaring away per
sons who might inspect the flat with
a view to renting if it should be found
suitable.
Mrs. Weissgerber denied the im
peachment, but did candidly acknowl
edge a feeling of aversion to Signor
Simi because he" had suddenly "raised
her out." When the complainant was
asked to prove that the offending senti
ments were written by the hand of
Sirs. Weissgerber, he confessed inabil
ity to do so* by producing samples of
the lady's chirography. Then the Judge
decided to continue the case until he
could visit the flat, examine the de
filed walls and by comparison of the
penciled warnings with specimens at
Mrs. Weissgerber's penmanship as
certain beyond a shadow of reasonable
doubt whether she did or did not com
mit the defilement.
In this delicate task the court will
be aided by Expert Kytka.

The meeting this morning was al
together a student affair. President
Jordan appeared at the opening of
the meeting and made a few remarks,
in which he stated that he~ regarded
some sort of an honor ' system as in
evitable in our educational institu
tions in this country In the not very
distant future. President Jordan also
read a letter from Harwood Hall of
the Sherman Institute at Riverside,
the school that supports the Perris
Indian football eleven, congratulat
ing Stanford on having an eleven
which played such clean and sports
manlike football as that put up
against .the Indians on Thanksgiving
day in ~Los Angeles. After his few
remarks President Jordan, the only
faculty member present, withdrew
and a discussion of the "honor sys
tem" by the students followed.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 3.
â A mass meeting of the student body
was held in Assembly Hall this morn
ing for the purpose of discussing the
advisability of adopting at Stanford
the so-called "honor system" as it is
in vogue at Princeton. The main idea
of the system is to rest the control of
the punishment of students found
cheating in examinations with- the
students themselves and make all of
the students bound by pledge to re
port any student found cheating to
the student tribunal appointed to
Judge In such cases and let that be a
court of last resort to determine
whether or not the offense has been
committed. If the accused is found
guilty he is to be reported to the fac
ulty, who may either cancel his regis
tration or, In a flagrant case, expel
him from the university. A pledge la
also taken by every student that he
wili # neither give nor receive help in
an examination.
The college has become thoroughly
aroused over the question, which has
been agitated in the college daily pa
per for several days. Editorials and
communications, all in favor of the
proposed system, have almost filled
the official student body organ for sev
eral issues. However, that the Daily
Palo Alto has not won the entire stu
dent body to its view of the matter
was. evidenced by the opposition to It
that appeared In the mass meeting
this, morning.
A great many of the students quite
justly feel that there Is not any
amount of cheating done in the uni
versity large enough to justify such
a radical measure and that its adop
tion may lead the general public to
the erroneous conclusion that cheat
ing is prevalent at Stanford^ The op
ponents of the scheme favor allowing
each man being put on his individual
honor and oppose the requirement
that a man should be in duty bound
to report a fellow student. This sys
tem of each man being regarded as
on his individual honor not to cheat
is practically in vogue in the law de
partment and is proving: a thorough
success there, hence It Is argued that
the students of the other departments
should live up to the same code, as
all the students are 'supposed to have
an equally high sense of honor and
self-respect.

PRESIDENT IS â¢ -EVASIVE.
Â¦ When the interviewer .grew* .a bit
personal by guarded inquiry wheth
er any definite date had been set for
holding the long deferred meeting, of
the Southern Pacific directors and as
to the. possibility of there being made
a. change in the presidency of the
company, Mr. Harriman answered the,
first query with a serious "I haventt
given it 'a thought," and then taking
up the other relative to the selection
of a new head of the corporation he
exhibited one of his best smiles as he
replied:
"That I can't say. It might be for
the good of the road. What do you
think of it?" ( Â¦ >
, Since President Harriman started
,on his Western trip New York finan
ciers, among them James K. Edmond
son, ,a stockholder in the. company,
have beqn publicly discussing the
probability of the Southern .Pacific
Company paying no . dividends ; for
some time to come and Edmondson
only recently volunteered the proph
ecy-,that "none 'would .be \ paid until
1905 ahd t that a one would be paid dur
ing that year.* It has been intimated
Ihai it is the plan of the Southern Pa
cific Company, when . it refunds â¢ its
f hlgh rate bonds, the' heavy expendi
tures .. made,; by- the : company in the
way of imprbvemehts during the last
two years and^wnlch have been charg
ed to earnings, will be adjusted in the

In the end' these i improvements will
be capitalized as a . means - of reim
bursing the r company's treasury. By
capitalizing.' the: improvements,, % which
are to ! be , da ssed as â¢ permanent, v they
become; chargeable -, to the capital jac-jj
count.- ',^.;- â¢" ':?r^.. ;
Asked whether the company would
soon take up the; work. -of building: a
tunnel, through- the Sierras, Mr. Harri
man replied that the proposition to
tunnel , had: been Â» under consideration,
but no definite action had been taken.
'.'I have not yet seen the plans for
the, proposed tunnel ", he said, "and I
have not 1 had-.tlme Ao even give the
serious thought it probably deserves."
A query . r regarding the proposed
bridging of Carquinez Straits received
a simUar answer from' the railroad
president, who, however, added that
both the tunnel and the bridge were
probabilities. He maintained, as he did
on 'the occasj^..0Â£^his 'former.. visit , to
this city, that Jjeknew nothing about
the plans for a connecting line | with-
Eureka, and refused to discuss Â¦ ','the
company's trouble across the 'bay. rela
tive to the renewal of its Alameda,fran
chise, explaining that the matter,' had
not been looked into by him, but -would'
probably be taken up by him' during
his stay in the city. : .;: .â¢
CONCERNING DIVIDENDS. â¢
MAGNATE'S FUTURE >LANS.
.E. IL Harriman, president of the
Southern Pacific Company, accompa
nied by a party^of friends, arrived from
Southern California in his private car
at ' an early , hour yesterday morning,
and during his short stay in San Fran
cisco wilV^rhake his home at the Pacific-
Union -Chib. Yesterday the railroad
magnate spent the greater part of the
day in. the company's office conferring
with General Manager Kruttschnltt,
Chief Engineer Hood, Chief Counsel
Herrin and others pi omlnent officials of
the corporation. How long President
Harriman expects to remain in this
city he would not state, and he ap
peared equally diffident in furnishing
other Information that the general pub
lic might be concerned in.
: At a 420-words-a-minute rate he dis
cussed - ; the engineering achievement
which Is to be known in railroad his
tory as the Lucin- cut-off, and prefaced
his remarks on other subjects with a
statement that he and his financial as
sociates in the big railroad enterprise
had. accomplished a great deal, during
the last two years, and purposed how
to enjoy a. breathing spell.
"When one stops for a moment," he
remarked, "to consider that this great
piece of engineering work, across the
Salt Lake was accomplished within
eighteen months at a cost of many
millions of dollars he certainly will con
cede that we performed a remarkable
feat and have cause* to pause in our
plans for the further betterment of the
Southern Pacific Company's overland
route. In twenty-four months we have
left behind us not only the Lucin cut
â¢off,,but all the, important work. of re
construction east of Reno. We will
now bide our time to 'determine', the ex
tent ' of the benefits that will accrue
from these successful engineering un
dertakings." .
* ; Mlss 'Boyere's'deposition* showed that
the alleged marriage took place in New
|york! December 2, 1902, at the home of
Charles Â«T.* Henshall. Previous to that
time she held a written agreement of
Whittell's to make her his wife, but
this she surrendered to his father, and
It was destroyed. The contract mar
riage, however, she held, and it \yas
made part of the evidence In the case.
It r^ads'as follows:
Â¦ 'â¢ -' ' . . â¢ December 2. 1002.
Â¦ :..yl hereby agrre'e to and have married George
WhitteHTJr, to-nlKht.

: I. hereby agree to and have married Flor
ence M. Boyere to-night.
â¢ , , OEORGE WHITTELL JR.
.Witnessesâ Charles T. Henshall, Grace E.
Henshall."
,: In "her* 'deposition she says that the
night ; the contract was executed she
asked,* in response to Whittell's request
that "she become his wife^that some
one to' ; perforny the ceremony be sent
for, but he suggested the contract. He
then begged her not to record it on the
ground that he feared- his father would
learn of his becoming a benedict. He
fairly cried for her to marry 'him, she
s' y>, agreeing that In the r event of her
lj.. .ming his bride he would rerietv the
contract every six months. She also
states that she was left penniless in
Chicago, and that before coming but
here she was compelled to pawn her
sealskin coat and her jewelry.
CONTRACT IN EVIDENCE.
from the public the story of the con
tract marriage of. young Whittell, the
grandson of Nicholas Luning, the fam
ous money-lender, and beautiful Flor
ence Boyere, the divorced wife of Ho
mer Selby, the brother of "Kid" Mc-
Coy, the pugilist. At present she is the
sister-in-law of Selby, for a short time
after the erstwhile Mrs. . Selby got her
divorce on the ground of infidelity he
married her pretty sister, : Rosalie
Boyere.
' The papers would also have revealed
that Attorney Hanlon's suit over "ad
verse claims" (for such'^was the ; type
of action he brought at the reque3t of
"Whittell's father to determine the va
lidity^of the contract marriage) was a
suit in which not only was the contract
itself involved, but the property of
young Whittell and also his honor. For
Miss Boyere in her cross-complaint al-.
leses that Whittell betrayed her under
promise of marriage. For this she
asked for $100,000 damages, but waived
her right to monetary balm in the event
that' the evidence adduced would show
that she was the lawful wife of Whit
tell.
v STORY IS UEVEAXED.
Th'e character of the papers make
plain the attorney's reason for keeping
them out of sight. Had they been seen
it would have been impossible to keep

papers, namely, the deposition of Miss
Boyere and her answer and cross-com

from the County Clerk's office the day

Little Miss Cowles had reached the
â¢"Papillons" of Schumann when I- ar
\ rived at Steinway Hail. The hall was
" crowded to hear this clever youngster
a fid the stage was a bank of flowers.
SHe had already played the D minor
â¢ Fgntasie of Mozart, the E minor Fan
taÂ«fe of Cecil Cowles immediately after
' â jiravo Cecil; Impromptu, also home
made; the Rheinberger Fuge, op. 5,
Nti. 3. The Schumann group included
besides" the "Papillons" the "Arabeske"
and "Vogel als Prophet."
â¢ * It was in her next group that I heard
the s-mall pianist, now arrived at the
' dignity of nine years, and I'm glad I
â¢ went. Ho me the little girl shows un
mistakable evidence of genius. There
â¢.were bits of the Brahms intermezzo
given with astonishing understanding,
the suave movement of the "Papillons"
fejl into a supple weft, only attainable
â¢ by the initiate, and the Linding
"Fruehlingsrausehen" was romically
masterly. The Chopin E m5nor waltz
holds technical flights yet impossible
to : the little player, and in consequence
there were all sorts of rhythmic tricks
played. Cut she has beÂ«n cleverly and
consciencefully taught by Mr. Mans
feldt, her teacher, now for a year. She
lias an already wide technical grasp,
â¢ h(ir tone is deep, her touch clean and
â¢ orlsp, and Miss Cowles is well on the
, .way to good pianipm. There is still
the same wholesome absence of emo
tional forcing as on h_er former appear
ance, but also the unmistakable evi
dence of temperament. A Chcpin and
â¢ two .Dvorak numbers ended the pro
. gramme-
BLANCHE PARTIXGTOX.
â¢ There rrere two recitals last evening:,
Q^flrew Bogart's song recital at Maple
ildll and the piano recital of Miss Cecil
Cowles at Stdnway HalL Fortunately
for myself I decided to take in Mr.
Bogart's first or there would have been
. none to take in. The barytone's pro
f'ramme was a miniature affair. It
beÂ£an.at S:25 and ended at 9 o'clock.
. It was Mr. Bogart's first appearance
here for a goodly span of years and
thferÂ© were many people to greet him.
Some of them arrived late and found
"only three or four songs awaiting them.
Still, the average song recital is a bore
by means of .Its length, and one should |
â¢perhaps welcome this departure from
'precedent. VO
Of their kinds singer and songs were
perfect. Delicate morceaux, pretty
sentiment, delightfully articulated in a
smooth, "finished, flexible fashion, were
offered by the singer. His voice, a
light, sweet barytone, lent itself ad
mtrably to their fiber. The programme I
made no demands on dramatic capac
ity, nor emotional deeps, but its dainty
s.adness, gentle gayety, were most ad
equately given by. Mr. Bogart. His
first group of songs included "The
Happy Lover," "Lacia il dir" and a i
â¢'Drinking Song." all of the seventeenth
pentary. A quartet of Schumann songs,
"My Love, Lay Thy Hand," " 'Twas in
the Month of May," "When Through
the Piazzetta" and "Row, Gently Row,"
followed. The programme closed with
three numbers by American composers:
"Bring Her Ag^in to Me'\(>J. Clifford
Page), that vras redemanded: John W.
Metcalf's charming "Absent," also in
sistently encored, and "An - Open Se
cret," by I?. â¢ Huntingdon Woodman.

fHEY ACTUALLY
DO THE WORK
Tod Eatea Is Worthless Unless Digested
âSome Stomachs Hust Save Help.
Food taken into the stomach, which,
I from the nature of the food or" the con-
dition of the stomach, is not 'digested,
is worse than no food at all. This is a
true statement a? far as it goes and a
preat many dyspeptics^ go only thts far
\~ith their reasoning. ..They argrue with
themselves that because their stomachs
do -not do the work given them, they
.liiust be given less work; in other
Â¦words, they murt be starved. It would
be just as sensible for a business man
who- is unable to d'* all. his own work
tq cut down his business to his own ca-
pacity as it is for a man to starve
himself to relieve his stomach. The
sensible business man employs help
and goes forward with his business.
Likewise the sensible dyspeptic will
emnJoy help for his stomach and give
his body proper nourishment.
i -Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets actually j
do the work assigned to them. They re- i
Here weak and overburdened stomachs
.of a great portion of "digestive action..
Their component . parts are ' identical
. -with those of the digestive fluids and
secretions of the stomach and they sim-
"ply take up the grind and carry; on
the work. Just the same 4s a good,
Etronp, healthy stomach would do;it.
On' this . account Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are perfectly natural in tfleir
action and effects. They do not cause
any unnatural or violent disturbance In
tte stomach or bowels. They them-
. selves digest the food and. supply the
. system with all the nourishment con-
tained In what is eaten and carry out
â¢ Nature's plans fbr the sustenance and
maintenance of the body.
How much more sensible is this
method than that employed by many
I sufferers from weak stomachs. By
this means body and brain get all the
good, nutritious food* they need and the
man is properly, nourished and equipped
to carry on his work and perform his
duties. He could not 'possibly be in.
proper working condition by starving
himself or employing BOtne new fangled,-
insufBclent food that dÂ«es .'not contain
enough nutriment for a. year-old baby.
A strong man doing. strong work rhust
be. properly, fed and this applies to the
brain as well as the:body. .' y
Stuart's Dysprepstsr'Tabletis, by're-
Slieving the stomachYcf Its worky enable
it to recuperate^ and regain Its normal'
health and; strength. Nature repairs
the worn" and wasfed tissues just" as she
heals f and knits ' the bone of .a' broken
limb,';'which"ls of course^hot; used dur-
ing the process of repair. ,
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by. all:xirugglsts at GO cents a box
and they are the one article that the
druggist does not. try to sell something
in the place of that's "just as good."
Their usqualiSed merit and success and
the universal demand for them has
placed them within the reach of every
one. hHBHBIRBBMI

N. w., WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.âGen
eral Reyes, ' Colombia's warrior diplo
mat, accompanied by Dr. Thomas
Herran, the Colombian Charge here,
took luncheon to-day with Secretary
Hay at his home. There was an en
tirely informal conference, but, never
theless, General Reyes, with his usual
keen insight, saw that there, was only
one ground on which he could conduct
any negotiations regarding the Pana
ma crisis with the State Department,
and that was to accept the United
States' proffer of good offices to peace
ably settle, the differences between
Panama and Colombia. The luncheon
developed the fact that General Reyes
carried In his inside pocket credentials
as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary on a special mission.
General Reyes will be presented in
this capacity to President Roosevelt
within a few days.
The President intends that adminis
trative influence shall be used in such
a way as to induce Panama to assume
part of Colombia's debt. This subject
has not been .broached to Bunau-Va
rilla, the Minister of Panama, but soon
will be, as President Roosevelt intends
to send the canal CVeaty to the Senate
on December 7. Whether this will
give it right of way over the Cuban
treaty remains to be seen. ;..",'-x."
Secretary Hay had a talk with the
President to-day about developments
on' the Isthmus and Secretary Moody
dropped in while the subject was un
der consideration and joined in the
conference. As a result it 13 possible

BBITISH PUBE FOOD
COMMISSION BEPOBTS
Becommends the Prohibition of the
Sale of Beer or Other Liquids
Containing Arsenic.
LONDON. Dec. 3.â The Royal Com
mission on Arsenical Poisoning from
Food and Drink recommends the pro
hibition of the sale of beÂ»r and. other
liquid food or of any liquid entering
into the composition of food which "con
tains one-hundredth of a grain or more
of arsenic per gallon, and the prohibi
tion of the sale of solid food contain
ing one hundredth of a grain per
pound, "no matter whether habitually
consumed in large or small quantities
or whether consumed alone (like golden
syrup) or mixed with water or other
substances (like chicory, etc.)."
The commissioners find there are se
rious defects in the present machinery
available to safeguard the public, and
urge that more* extended powers be
given to the authorities to condemn un
wholesome food, the establishment of
official "standards" and the creation of
a "board of reference," to which could
be referred specific points and whose
decisions should be carried out by the
department concerned, the latter's ac
tion being subject to the control of Par
liament.

raigned, pleaded not guilty and his
bond was fixed, at $1000. The bond was
furnished by Samuel F. Scott, ex-post
master of Kansas City, - and Senator
Jewell was released. . His case was set
for hearing on February 9 next.
The sudden decision of the Cabinet
is believed to be due to the fact that
King Alfonso wiln?tart for Lisbon De
cember 12 and that Premier Villa
verde was anxious to get matters set
tled before his Majesty's departure.
The Republicans secured the as
sistance of the Carlists and Democrat
ic Liberals in opposing the Govern
ment's proposal to pass a bill to en
force the budget provisionally after
January 1, in the event of the cham
ber failing fo adopt the budget, and
the Cabinet, seemingly having become
hopeless of getting the bill adopted,
decided to resign.
The resignation of the Ministry was
the* outcome of difficulty encountered
in getting the budget voted in the face
of the Republican policy of obstruc
tion.
It is expected that General Acar
riaga. President of the Senate, will
be charged with the task of forming
a new Cabinet.

Bryan, at which a number of Irish and
Liberal members of the House of Com

here devoted themselves to the welfare

Chancellor von Bulow then nodded
to Dr. Victor Rintelin, the oldest mem
ber present, who, stepping forward,
proposed three cheers for the Em
peror, in which the few spectators
joined.
The message was favorably com
mented upon, emphasis being placed
on the fact that the Government had
not made any unusual demands upon
the taxpayers. Satisfaction was also
expressed at the fact that the Govern
ment did not propose to introduce con
troversial legislation, so that the com
mercial treaties can be freely and
fully discussed.
After luncheon the members reas
sembled In the Reichstag for the pre
liminaries of organization. All the So
cialists were then present.
The election of .President of the
Reichstag and the officers will take
place to-morrow. The Socialists, to
the astonishment of the other parties,
nominated Herr Singer for First Vice
President. This question was the sub
ject of a furious controversy all last
summer and nearly split the party.
Herr Rebel, who said a man who re
spected himself could never accept the
vice presidency because he would have
to go to court on occasion and call for
cheers for the Emperor, won a com
plete victory at the party convention
at Dresdon. The revisionists, under
the leadership of Herren Bernstein
and von Vollmar, proposed that the
party should seek a vice presidency as
a recognition of its strength, and were
nearly driven out of the party organi
zation. It was even expected that
Herr Bernstein might join the Barth
Radicals in consequence of Herr Be
bel's autocratic disposition. The Con
servatives and members of the Center
party were . rejoicing, believing that
the effectiveness of the Socialist op
position would be lessened by. an in
tense internal fight during' the pres
ent Reichstag. They were amazed,
therefore, to-day to find the Socialists
acting in accord on the one question in
dispute.
CHEEBS FOB THE EMPEBOB.
In congratulating the members of
the Reichstag on the very friendly re
lations of Germany with other coun
tries, the Chancellor said the imperial
Government had contributed Its share
to the avoidance of serious complica
tions in the Balkans.
The Government, continued the
Chancellor, would propose retaining
the present army footing to April 25,
1905, but it is desired to Increase the
salary list because of the growing cost
of living. The Government further
proposed to continue the development
of social legislation in the interest of
the weaker classes. The Government
also intended prolonging the present
"most favored relations" with Great
Britain. r \" \
The Chancellor then passed to the
economic stage of the country, which,
he said, still suffered somewhat from
the world-wide depression, which was
unfavorably affecting the imperial
finances. Emphasizing the ever-in
creasing necessity for regulating the
financial situation of the empire with
the separate states, the Chancellor re
marked that, although a radical set
tlement of the question was not now
feasible, the Government would pro
pose a measure introducing the most
essential reforms.
"His Majesty has directed me to ex
press here his thanks to all those wh?
have sympathized with his suffering
and to say that their sympathy and
hopes for his recovery have greatly re
joiced him."
PBOMISES MANY BEFOBMS.
BERLIN. Dec. 3. â Chancellor von
Bulow, as the Emperor's representa
tive, to-day opened the Reichstag in
the White Hall of the palace. The
members of the Reichstag, In even
ing dress, court costume, military uni
forms or clerical coats, stood close to
gether in front of the Emperor's
throne. The assemblage was smaller
than on the last occasion, twenty-flve
of the loyalists having been turned
out by the Socialists, none of whom
ever attends the opening of the
Reichstag, which is essentially a
court function, all the members pres
ent wearing a royal order.
When the Chancellor appeared,
with the Cabinet Ministers, all present
bowed. He said:
Another charge made by Dr. Desver
n^nie was that some of the Judges, who
tried the postal cases were not named
parte evidence was not admissible In

had made the amendment which abro
gated statutes and enacted anew law,
and said this opened the door to ex

of the Runcie article in General Wood's !
interest, and asked him if the letter did !
not show that there had been confer
ences on the subject and a perfect |
understanding. P.aker admitted that
appearances would lead to that infer
ence, but insisted there had not been:
any understanding.
Baker admitted that he and Wood [
and Runcie had discussed General;
Brooke's administration of Cuban af- |
fairs, but said the discussion had been :
irnpprsonal ar.d that Brooke's name had {
not been mentioned. He also said that â¢
General Wood had introduced him to i
Runcie when he was sent to Cuba.
At the afternoon session of the court j
the only witness heard was Dr. Pablo
Desvernenie, who was secretary of
finance under the administration of i
General Brooke as Governor General :
and later attorney for Major Rathbone. J
Dr. Depvernenie's testimony related en
tirely to tb.e instructions given to the '
court by General Wood. He charged j
that General Wood had changed laws
of Cuba in order to admit ex-parte evi-j
dence in. the postal cases.
BEVEBTS TO SPANISH LAWS.
The modification of the principles of
Cuban criminal procedure, which was
said to have been particularly detri
mental to the Interests of Major Rath- !
bone. Dr. Desvernenie declared, was !
made in an order Issued by General 1
Wood on April 30, 1900. The effect of
the order, Eaid the witness, was to re
vert to laws in force under the regime
cf colonial Spain thirty |*ears before.
According to the testimony of Dr.
Desvernenie, the orders made by Gen
eral Wood were Issued to the judge of I
{instructions, whom General Wood could !
remove at "his pleasure. The witness <
declared that the order was in violation ;
of the penal statutes and the rights of j
parties Interested In the postal cases.
As an Illustration of the powers of Gen
eral Wood under the military govern
ment the witness said that General;
Wood in one case removed a judge of
first instance in one of the high courts â¢
and also three of the associate judges]
of one section of the court. As a cause i
of removal It was said the judge had <
"not complied with the law as modified j
by General Wood. isEjB |

Baker was questioned closely by Sen- '

Senators Hanna and Teller, who were

letter.' to Baker, suggesting that the!
HAI7NA ASKS QUESTIONS.
Baker confirmed some parts of the]
testimony of Major Runcie and con- j
tradicted or qualified other portions of j
it. He denied that there had been any j
consultation between himself and Gen
eral Wood relative to the publication j
Â»f Major Runcie's article reflecting up
on the administration of General
Brooke. He said, however, that he had !
talked with General Wood regarding'
an article which was subsequently pub- j
liÂ«hed over his own signature. When
apked Whether he had conversed with
the President relative to the Wood
rase he replied in the negative, and
also made practically the same reply!
to a question as to whether he had con- !
furred with War Department officials Â¦
concerning the article which was pub- :
lished over the signature cl Major!
Runcie. Baker said that It had been !
given to him by Runcie. but that, so'
far as heTtnew. General Wood had no I
knowledge of it previous to its pub- J
Iication. He said he had talien dinner j
with General Wood and Major Runcie i
peveral times In Santiago, but that the
publication of an article attacking '
General Brooke had never been the sub- I
Ject of conversation.
BAKER'S BEPLIES AID WOOD.
Ray F.tannard Baker, the man who,
Major Runcie said, was at the dinner
with General Wood and himself when
the .proposed magazine article criticiz
ing- General Brooke was discussed, was
the next witness.
Stone was questioned concerning the
report that General Wood had sought
to retain E. G. Bellaires as the repre
sentative of the Associated Press in
Havana. He submitted a letter writ
ten by Major Runcle to Colonel Charles
S. Diehl. assistant general manager of
the Associated Press, which requested
in behalf of General Wood the reten
tion of Bellalres, saying it was impor
tant to have a man representing the
Associated Press In Havana who was
in' the confidence of the military gov
ernor. Stone said the matter was then
under the charge of Colonel Diehl.
Bellaires was retained, but his pre
vious record was rot known to the
officers of the Associated Press. When
it became known Bellalres was dis
charged.
Stone also was asked as to what
knowledge General Wood had of Bel
laires' record, but on this point he could
give the commission little information.
It was decided that Colonel Diehl
should be subpenaed.

The presentation of hats to the new

that the red hat was first given to Car

signify that they should always be

of the church. Bayle, however, in his

therefore, use the color of the sun.

SJuidozvs of the Past.
. Some Chinese workmen were remov
ing earth in the rear of the Chinese
Consul's house the other day to make
room for some needed improvements.
Suddenly they__jmcovered the grave of
a thousand and one bu?"ied joys. There
in a pit beneath a pile of rubbish were
hundreds of champagne corks in all
stages of petrifaction from long ex
posure to the elements.
- .The Chinese were at a loss to account
for the presence of the corks and for
the nonce there were some who had
suspicions ot the convivial tendencies
of the respected Consul from the Flow
ery Kingdom. But it was an old-timer
who solved the mystery. In the good
old days of. the sixties the present home
of the Chinese Consul was the palatial
residence ot F. L. Pioche, than whom
there never was a more open-handed
entertainer and genial host. The fame
of his table spread abroad In the land
and those who were fortunate enough
to dine at his board felt that they had
not missed the opportunity of their life
time.
But years ago Pioche came to a
tragic end and now there remain of all
his past grandeur only the corks.
THE Sacramento Union has "made a critical study
of the body of school teachers who were recently
in attendance at the proceedings of the Sacramento
County Teachers' Institute. What especially attracted
the attention of the Union was the fact that there were
about twenty women teachers to one man teacher in the
assemblage. This leads the Union's writer-spectator to
remark:
"It is particularly noticeable that of young men there
are almost none. The male teachers, for the most part,
appear to be survivals of an earlier era, and it would
seem that pretty much all the recruits in -the teaching
profession, are women."
The Sacramento women teachers would seem to be
a very comely lot and gifted with high intelligence,
for the Union says that "looking at it critically as an as
semblage and comparing it by the tests of appearance,
personal manners and the look of interest and atten
tion, one is bound to concede that this body of teachers
compares favorably with the professional assemblages of
a few years back. Judging by the formal papers and the
discussions upon them, there would . seem to be no
doubt that'the/ standards of the teaching profession have
been considerably advanced in late years." â¢ .
This is not all that the Union found to admire in the
women teachers: The purely~fcminine traits gained the
customary^ tribute of male approval: "Almost every
face in the room bears satisfying marks of intelligence
and intellect. The well nourished physique speaks of
the advantages of California climate, and the superfine
raiment of most of the young women speaks for the
financial liberality of the communities to which they arc
attached and of- the excellence of the Sacramento stores,
where most of them do their trading."
But, having spoken in this flattering manner, the
Union raises a protest concerning the feminization of the
schools. Incidentally the ground is laid for a discussion
of great interest. "Women, it is said, are natural teach
ers. They are certainly the teachers of young children;
but we very much question if teaching in its advanced
forms â in at. least some of its advanced forms â docs not
call for the masculine mind, the masculine method, the
masculine mood. < We question, if our educational sys
tem would not be very much strengthened by such re
organization as would divide, at.lea?t, its duties between,
men and women. We find it difficult to conceive of a
suitable system of education for girls in which men
should be the sole teaching element, and we are as little
disposed; to concede that an effective system for boys
may be wholly, administered by women in the class
rooms."
Possibly the Union may change the current of af
fairs, but it is very doubtful. Especially- will this prove
a reasonable conjecture when, according to the Rev. Dr.
N. D. Hillis of New York, women are now engaged in
145 branches of business, *and "women in fifty years will
know more than the men." ... >
FEMINIZING THE SCHOOLS.
Old-Time Automobile.
. BT MALCOLM McDOWELL..
(Author of 'Shop Talk on the Wonders of the
Craft*.")
(Copyright, 1003. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Enthusiastic automobilistsâ and al
most every "driver" of the horseless
vehicle is an enthusiast â have ventur
ed the opinion that nothing: but the
lack of uniformly good roads prevents
the automobile from making the loco
live a second-rate motor. This rather
largre claim might provoke a derisive
smile but for the recorded fact that
had it not been for the bad roads of
England Just one hundred years ago
there might not have been any loco
motive. The automobile and locomo
tive are self-movers â the one runs on
comon roads and the other on rail
i-oads â and the automobile Is the fa
ther of the locomotive.
The original locomotive was an au
tomobile â a steam carriage, designed
to run on common roads and turn
pikes. It was design^^and construct
ed by a couple of coal-mining engin
eers-^-Trevithlck and Vivian â and was
the first high-pressure steam "locomo-^
tive" ever operated. There had been"
several models of low-pressure steam
"road-wagons"' ma.de before the "Welsh
engineers put together the little
steam runabout which became the ori
ginal of the modern automobiles and
locomotives. It was a compact little
affair with a single cylinder and a fly
wheel and it was tested â so one ac
count reads â on Christmas day 1S02.
But the little machine was only suc
cessful in that it proved the practica
bility of using high-pressure steam for
j.ropplling a vehicle.
Just one hundred years ngo this
month Richard Trevlthick was com
pleting a high-pressure steam self
mover, which he placed on the tram
rails of a coal mine in Wales in 1804.
This was the first locomotive in that
it was the first automobile to be placed
on rails. But when Trevi thick was
building it he intended running it on
a turnpike, but the roadway was in
bad condition and he tried it on rails
of the, coal mine tramway.
At the World's Fair in St. Louis
next year the centennial of the loco
motive is to be ceremoniously celebra
ted, but it will be seen that the same
day can be as well called "autcrniobile
day" â it's a toss up which Trevithick's
machine was â an .automobile or a lo
comotive.
The first quarter of the last century
developed an automobile craze much
more virulent than the "devil wagon"
furor of to-day. The modern chauffeur
who has been haled into police courts
and fined by country Justices may find
large comfort. in knowing that the first
automobillsts were prosecuted, perse
cuted., stoned. Jeered, taunted) fined,
prohibited and had a hard time of it
all around. .
In the 1820's and '30's steam carriages
to run on common roads became such a
fad that the directors of toll roads and
the stage coach companies became
alarmed. They slipped a number of lit
tle bills through Parliament permitting
toll roads to levy prohibitive tolls on
steam carriages' and wagons. Thus in
1831 Mr. Guerney, who built and oper
ated several steam carriages, was
charged Â£2 and 8 shillings for his
steam carriage on the Liverpool and
Prescott road: the ordinary toll for a
loaded six-horse stage coach was but
4 shillings. On other turnpikes the
B|eam carriages were compelled to pay
from five to seven times what the huge
lumbering stage coaches were required
to pay. Â¦
But notwithstanding persecution, fail
ures and bad roads, the steam carriage
was Improved and grew in popularity
bo that in 1838 eighteen steam coaches
and drags for carrying passengers were
built or building in London and its
vicinity. Private steam carriages which
made from fifteen to twenty miles an
hour were common, and many lines of
steam coaches between large, cities,
transporting thousands of passengers,
were established. sBRB
Some of these early automobiles car
ried an amazing steam pressure in their
boilers. The ordinary pressure was
from seventy to 150 pounds to the
square inch, but It is of record that
some of the "cracks" run by their titled
owners carried a steam pressure of 300
to 400 pounds to the square Inch. The
chauffeur of to-day, who, in his gaso
line and racing car, equipped with ev
erything that is up to the minute,
drives his automobile seventy to eighty
miles an hour, is properly tagged
"reckless." But what would you call
the man who, with a crude, untried
machine, forced his boiler to carry 400
pounds pressure to the inch to, reach
the unprecedented jspeed of twenty
miles an hour ?

THE proposition to include the Japanese in the
Chinese exclusion law brings up a vexed question.
The subject illustrates the change and swing. â in
public opinion.' When the Burlingame treaty was made
with China the principal interest in its favor was mani
fested in California. The Chinese were then regarded
with favor here and.no obstruction was offered to their
coming.
Though the immigration under it was not large, for
it is doubtful if we got to exceed 250*000 Chinese here
from the beginning of that immigration^ the stress and
strain of hard times preceding 1879 caused them to be
felt as a dangerous increment, and we attempted by va
rious devices in our local laws to restrict a further in
flux of that clement. But the constitution makes a treaty
the supreme law of the land, and the Supreme Court
held that local legislation could not set the Burlingame
treaty aside. It was pointed out that the only way to
restriction was by amending the treaty. Since then it
has been amended or substituted three times, but each
time certain treaty rights have been preserved for the
Chinese. Those who were here under any of the trea
ties were permitted to register, in evidence of their right
to be here, and laborers returning to China are still per
mitted to return upon evidence of certain qualifications
of family or property:
No one is exactly sure that the present exclusion law
conforms to the treaty, and the Supreme Court, in a col
lateral proceeding, indicated its purpose to pass upon the
constitutionality of the law by bringing it to judgment
on the "most favored nation" clause of the treaty. It is
remembered that when this last exclusion law was be
fore Congress Mr. Gompers strongly advised that it
should not include the Japanese. Those people, there
fore, have bfcen coming in without restriction, other than
that imposed by the general immigration laws. It is
now regarded as demonstrated that the Japanese are a
far less desirable element than the Chinese;' and we have
the singular result of an evident rise in favor of the
Chinese by reason of the contrast between them and
their island neighbors.
The enforcement of the Chinese treaty, by preserving
to the few Chinese here the rights it gives them, raises
an issue that applies to other treaties as well. The un
lawful expulsion of Chinese from Colorado, and the same
acts at Tonopah, in Nevada, accompanied by robbery and
murder, and their expulsion from localities in this State,
which has recently occurred, brjng out the fact that the
Federal Government cannot enforce the observance of
a treaty by djrect action. Foreigners who are here under
the most favored nation clause in treaties are, like'citi
zens, entitled to the protection and subject to the pen
alties of local laws. If they arc denied the one or are
denied justice in the imposition of the other, their first
recourse is to the local authorities. In event of the denial
of justice they have the right of appe"al to their own
Government. Such cases, however, do not arise, for it is
the glory of our jurisprudence that a Chinese coolie is as
safe in the hands of American courts as any citizen.
The expulsion of these people from localities by un
lawful physical force and threats raises another question,
that is exactly like the Boxer tactics against foreigners in
China, and like the various outrages in 'this country
against the subjects of Italy. Under existing laws all
that the Federal Government can do is to respond in
money damages, as it has in the case of the Chinese in
Wyoming and elsewhere, and of the Italian's in Louisi
ana. In the expansion of our influence among the na
tions it may be that some further power of direct action
in the enforcement of treaty rights will have to be de
posited in the Feder-al Government, and the whole ques
tion may come up in considering the proposition to ex
clude Japanese.
We have a treaty of amity and comity with Japan,
and we have also commercial and extradition treaties
with that empire. These treaties pla.ee, her and her peo
ple in exactly the same relations to us as those which
exist between the United States and Great Britain or
any other European power. Japanese have the right" to
come and go, subject only to the immigration laws which
apply to Europeans. The Government of the Mikado
some time ago indicated its intention to oppose and re
sent any different classification of its people, declaring
that it would be degrading and offensive to the national
spirit. 4
For Japan this is an unfortunate time to raise, the
question. In her controversy with Russia she is assert
ing her right to equality of treatment as a world power
influential in the affairs of Asia. Her future depends
upon maintaining this position and her retention of per
fect equality of right in international matters. This she
canjhardly do if compelled to submit to what she regards
as the degradation of her people. This makes the issue
one of extreme delicacy and difficulty, and one of the
chief vexations originating; in our anti-Chinese legisla
tion. Japan at one time proposed to protect her national
dignity by forbidding the migration of her people to the
United States in order to avoid the necessity of what
she regarded as formal disgrace, by legislation.
"He Laughs Best"
The following is a new one on Peter
Martin: Andrew McCreery,' the capital
ist and father of Lawrence McCreery,
the celebrated rolo player, was down
at Burlingame a short time before the
Martin wedding. The gentlemen men
tioned were seated at a table In the
Burlingmamo clubhouse playing whist?
McCreery senior wore a beautiful dia
mond ring, and Martin, wishing to
have a Joke at the expense of the keen
old gentleman, said: "Mr. Creery, that's
a fine ring you have." "Yes," said Mc-
Creery. "it ought to be; it cost $800."
Martin asked to see it and the ring was
handed over.
The others, thinking: to distract Mc-
Creery's attention, passed the stone
from one to J.he other and finally back
to Martin, at the same time turning
the conversation In as many directions
as the diamond had sides. They suc
ceeded for a time', but finally
said: "What about that ring, Martin?"
The latter, who had been trying again
to pass the stone to some one else,
dropped.it quietly to the floor and
winked knowingly to the waiter, say-
Ing: "Why, didn't I return it? I cer
tainly haven't it."- A pretended search
was made, and the waiter finally found
the ring on the floor and returned it.
McCreery quietly thanked him. Then
Martin spoke up: "That's a \-aluable
find, McCreery. and a five would prob
ably be about right for the waiter."
McCreery acquiesced, but said: "I have
na small gold â have you a five, Mar
tin?" Martin chuckled and handed the
amount to the waiter and the Incident
wras closed. As time passed and Mc-
Creery did not refer to It, Martin gen
tly reminded him of the transaction.
McCreery said: "What five? Why, you
had $5 worth of fun out of me. and you
surely don't expect to have the fun and
the money also, do you?" And the five
is still "coming."
THE OBSERVANCE OF TREATIES.
Start to lead with your left for your
Fparring partner's face. He will in
stinctively raise his right arm to guard,
or will in other ways seek to avert ihe
blow. Let your left travel toward- him
only far enough to create the impres
sion that you are about *to lead. Then
Fwingr, hc-ok or !ead straight with the
right.- If you do this quickly enough
and make your objective point what
ever part of his body seems -most un
guarded the chances are. that you will
land. Or feint with the right and then
lead with the left.
Here is another. feint: Â£tart to lead
for his head;, then change the direction
of your blow and with the same hand
strike for his heart or wind. Inversely,
feint U;t the body, check the blow,
change the direction of the hand and
iead for the face.
Start to swing or hook with your left
or right .for your opponent's body.
Check the course of the blow, let it
describe an upward circle and land on
his jaw. This latter feint requires great
speed, but is one of the most effective
of them all.
Lower both hands and arms with a
suSd^n gesture. When they have drop
ped about six inches, lead for the face
with your left. Your opponent will,
unconsciously, lower his guard in imi
tation of this first gesture of yours (I
don't know why he will do this, but
he'll do It nine times out of ten if your
gesture is auick enough). Your blow
thus passes above his lowered guard
and lands fair and- square on his un
protected face. Of course, swift ac
tion alone will permit you to do this
successfully.
In our next lesson we will take up
"clinches" and "in-fighting."

refused therefore to change his place of residence, the
penalty of absenting himself being that he would lose
the property. Soon after he died. Then the hotel was
burned. Mrs. Cummings remained. After twenty-six
years she is in a fair way to get title; to : the- land ;from

The Republican Press tells of another citizen who
''has been waiting fourteen years to prove up." The ac
count tells also of several who have expended thousands
of dollars each in the firm and patient belief that finally
they would be rewarded for holding on. Finally v the
Government has ordered 'the opening up for entry of the
lands in question. Fiye townships in all are now thrown
open. The .land is valuable for grazing principally, bur
included in the townships are orchards and some Um
bered claims. When the news arrived in Ukiah that the
Government had acted, after waiting a generation since
the first settlers planted their stakes, there was a rush
to the local land office of the United States. In a short
time more than a score of settlers, each of whom had
lived more than five years on the land claimed by him,
made their, filings. 0
There must be something very attractive in Mendocino
County climate and life that induces patience and per
sistency like this. The entire transaction is an excellent
advertisement for Mendocino County, as it is indubitably
shows in what estimation the land is held by those who
have had opportunity best to know it.

been unable to serve a subpena on
Mrs. Coit to attend the hearing in the
Police Court.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 3.
â George Herbert Clark," '04. rated
the best left end on, the coast, was to
night elected captain of the Stanford
varsity football eleven for next year.
Clark's record as a member of the
cardinal eleven during the last three
years has been a brilliant one and in
knowledge of the game he i9 excelled
by no one on the team. His strongest
point is on defense in breaking up
the Interference and tackling the man
with the ball.
Clark began his career as a football
player at Stanford as fullback on the
'04 freshman team, but did not ap
pear as a candidate for the varsity
until his sophomore year, when he
easily won his position at left end and
the right to the varsity emblem. Next
year will be Clark's last at the game,
the four-year limit barring. him after
that. Clark's opponent in the elec
tion to-nÂ»ght was "Savage" Dole, left
half, and the contest was close. The
captain-elect is a senior In the law
department and registers from Stock
ton. He is a member of the Phi Del
ta Theta and Sigma Sigma fraterni
ties.
Famous Left End Will Lead the Stan
ford University Football Team
Next Season.
GEOUGE HERBERT CLARK
TO CAPTAIN THE CARDINAL
The board had granted a permit for
a boxing tournament at the Tanners*
benefit in which McConnell was In
jured to the Keystone Athletic Club.
The records showed that the permit for
the benefit to McConnell was granted
to the Yosemite Athletic Club on con
dition that the latter organization
would Insure the payment of at least
$1000 for the medical services for Mc-
Connell. It developed that the club had
paid a total of $947 for McConnell'a
care. The committee postponed action
on the complaint until next Thursday,
when Coffroth will be cited to appear
to state his case and produce tha
vouchers.
Mrs. McConnell, mother of Frankle
McConnell, who was injured in a box
ing bout at the Tanners' benefit some
time ago, appeared before the Super
visors' Police Committee yesterday,
complaining- that she had not been
treated properly by James- Coffroth of,
the Tosemite Athletic Club in the ben
efit given to the injured pugilist. The
San Francisco Athletic Club had given
Mrs. McConnell $300 and the Yosemite
Club had paid $500 to the doctors and
$362 to St. Mary's Hospital. It waa
stated that the contestants in the ben
efit had received $2100 of the receipts
and the club had faced a deficit of $117.
The committee strongly expressed ita
disapproval of contestants being paid
such a large sum, thus reducing tha
amount which should have gone to Mc-
Conhell. Mrs. McConnell said she had
no fault to find with Alec Greggains,
but she thought James Coffroth of the
Yosemite Club should give her some
money in addition to the $S62 paid for
medical services and $S5 for Incidentals.
"I will say." said Braunhart, "that
it will be to the interest of the Yosem
ite Club not to have such complaint*
brought before this committee."

Three of the entries in the. collie
class wore said to be the best trio ever
t=ecn in a show on this coast. They
were fit to compete in any company.
Kavenswood. owned by Arthur Letts
of Los Angeles, captured the blue rib
bon. This dog won thirty-seven firsts
in Ensrlanfi as a puppy. Second prize
went to Champion Hanover Monarch,
owned by Miss Beach of San Jose.
â¢The third prize went to Glentana Sen
tinel, owned by Mrs. Griffiths of Spo
kane. The complete list of awards
made yesterday follows:
A unique and pleasing feature of
the show was the clever trick stunts
performed by four dogs under the
chappronage of "Dad" Moulton, the
noied Stanford University trainer.
Shortly before the pavilion was closed
for the night, "Dad" trotted his per
formers out into the center of the ring
and for half an hour he put his acro
batic pets through an interesting per
formance which made a hit with the
assemblage.
John Kiplinger of Seattle was one
of the most notable prize-winners of
the day. His superb kennel of English
setters carried off all the available
prizes in their claps. These dogs
were the center of attraction and they
well deserved the compliments so gen
trously bestowed upon them. They
won first prize in every class in which
thev were exhibited.
Around the judges' stand a large
crowd congregated and this particular
retreat was the meeting place of those
who knew. Much interest was mani
fested in each and every decision, and
whenever one of the favorite pets of
the show waa awarded a prize, it was
generally the signal for a round of
hearty applause.
Dog. cat and poultry fanciers in ev
ery walk. of life wended their way to
Mechanics' Pavilion last night to
cratch the proceedings of the third day
of the animal enow. All day long and
far into the night, the interested ones
paraded about the building, devoting
their attention to the numerous ca
nines, the high-grade chicks or the
pedigreed rats tliat were bo well repre
sented at the show.

ENTBIES EOB, TO-DAY.
Foley comes from St. Louis, where
few of the bookmakers would take
more than $20 on a favorite unless they
ilrst got a peak at the buried card. Un
less the young man infuses some vigor
into his riding he will find his early ac
quired popularity rapidly waning.
Blissful is a good actor at the post and
there was no excuse for not getting her
away better.
Adkins on Meehanus distinguished
himself by giving about as stupid an
exhibition of riding as has been seen
since the inception of the season. If
he had laid away behind Glenarvon
and Constellator until the stretch was
reached his mount could not have lost.
Instead he tried to get through where
there was not room and later on found
all of the pockets on the track. The
price about Meehanus receded from 2
to 3% to 1.
Burdoc started three times witlf H.
Smith up and on each occasion the
odds about the horse drifted skyward.
Yesterday he was ridden by Chandler
and there was some action behind him.
If cheap riders are good enough to ride
for the public's money they should an
swer the purpose when the owner
wishes to put his money down. This
sort of thing is too common and if a
few entries were refused it would have
a tendency to stop it.
D. Hall won two races.
Tommy Burns will arrive here on the
12th inst.
NOTES OF THE TKACK.
Barney Schreiber next took another
purse with his gelding Buccleuth. Four
to five was the market price, and the
Schreiber entry was returned a handy
winner over Galanthus. Chandler had
the mount on Burdoc, which was
backed at a long price, and ran a bang
up third.
A world of money went into the
books on Glenarvon to capture the
concluding mile and seventy yard
selling number. After alternating with
Constellator in cutting out the pace,
the good thing was beaten a neck by
Frank Woods, a 6 to 1 shot, piloted by
Jed Lewis.
SAN NICHOLAS IS SPEEDY.
San Nicholas, the black "horse from
the Burns & Waterhouse stable, seems
capable of running as, fast as he wants
to. A 2 to 5 favorite ror the six-fur
long purse event, he led from the staYt,
breezing home ahead of Geheimness in
1:13%. Allqpath made her first start
at the meeting and ran a creditable
third.
Although the card was an ordinary
one, the regulars all answered roll call
and betting was brisk. After the down
fall of Blissful another favorite, Glen
arvon, went by the board, much to the
satisfaction of the pencilers.
'Velma Clark was introduced to some
moderate company in the .first event,
a seven-furlong run decided under sell
ing conditions, and was installed a pro
nounced favorite. Jimmy Booker had
her in front almost as the webbing was
sprung and she won all the way. Ri
naldo, second throughout, lasted long
encrugh to beat Silver, Fizz a neck for
the place.
There was only one in the two-year
old scramble, Sir Appleby, that looked
competent to give Otto Stifel, the fa
vorite, an, argument. Adkins had the
leg up on that one and got lost at the
start. Stifel, wifh Hall up, made all
the running and finished well in hand
more than two lengths in advance of
Mike Daly's colt Judge. The show
went to Ananias.
. Had it not been for the defeat of
Blissful, the 8 to 5 favorite for the fifth
event at Oakland yesterday, there is
every likelihood that the combination
book would have been transformed into
a Frankfurter sausage stand, and a
third of the bookmakers would have
been walking delegates to-day.
Four straight choices had. won off the
reel and, flushed with success, the tal
ent just parleyed its winnings on
Blissful. Fcley had the mount on the
favorite and was fast asleep, with the
filly turned partially sideways, when
the barrier went up.
An Oakland policeman making his
last round before going off watch rap
ped Foley on the soles of his feet with
a riot club, cautioning him to move
on about his business. Foley did and
was beaten less than a length by So
menos, on which an educated play
forced the odds from 7 to 5. Louis
Wagner ran an easy third in this race.

Mayor Schmitz is of the opinion
that the alleged shortages in the Pub
lic Administrator's office may be re
covered from the bondsmen of John
A. Drinkhouse and Patrick j Boland,
who preceded John Farnham as Pub
lic Administrators. His Honor thinks
the bondsmen are liable for p. period
of four years after the expiration of
the terms of the officials named. , It
is not unlikely that demands will be
made on the bondsmen to pay the
several amounts alleged to be due the
city.
Mayor Schmitz expressed surprise
yesterday that the expert's report of
irregularities in the probate business
of the Public Administrator's and
County Clerk's offices had not been
filed -with him by the Supervisors'
Finance Committee, as the charter

SURPRISED THAT REPORT
WAS NOT FILED WITH HIM
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.âCommis
sioner of Pensions Ware has received
a letter from Governor Bliss of Michi
gan voluntarily relinquishing his pen
sion. In his letter Governor Bliss
says:
"I feel that I have won what I
wished, a place on the pension rolls
with my comrades of the War of the
Rebellion, and relinquish the pension
only because I doubt the propriety of
continuing as a pensioner when I am
not in need of It. My disability was
fully determined by two examinations,
one under Commissioner Evans and
the second under your administration,
each conducted by two doctors, the re
sults being an order placing me on the
rolls at $12 a month. My intention was
to donate this money to the work of
the G. A. R. and this I have done."

GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN
RELINQUISHES PENSION
"For a time I ran the shop alone,
but finallyfchad to quit, as my custom
ers were threatened with a boycott
unless they withheld their patronage
from me. To-day . I have nothing to
show for the money that I invested
In establishing one of the finest horse
shoeing plants on - this coast or any
where else, and all because I consid
ered that I was in the right and re
fused to comply with an order that
was unjust in the extreme and one
made simply because I incurred the
enmity of certain people in the same
line of business as myself."
Horsâ¬Shoâ¬r Tells of Alleged Buin
Boycott Against Him.
The trial of the suit of J. H. Mc-
Carthy ag-ainst the Master Horse
shoers* Association and the Journey
men Horseshoers' Union for $100,000
damages was commenced in Judge.
Hunt's court yesterday. The entire
day was spent in the examination of
McCarthy.
In support of his? charge that he
was driven out of business by the two
bodies he said: "I joined -the associa
tion In 1S9S. In February of this
year I was expelled and the day fol
lowing my expulsion I was approach
ed by the business agent of the asso
ciation, who demanded that I give up
its trademark. I refusfÂ»d to do so. and
he then called Walking Delegate
Parkinson of the Journeymen's
Union and told him I refused to com
ply with his demand, j Parkinson said
that as I was no longer a member of
the association, union men could not
work for me and he called my em
ployes out. He said he was compelled
to do as he did because of an agree
ment between the men and their em
players, whereby the former agreed
that they would not work for a man
not a member of the association. The
men said they did not want to go, as
I had always treated them right, but
that they had to obey orders. There
were thirty-six horses in my shop at
that time waiting to twÂ» shbd.

CHICAGO. Dec. 3.â Lieutenant Henry
Bankhead. U. S. A., son of Congress
man Bankhead of Alabama, and Miss
Alice Stickney.. whose guardian was
the late Judge Long, at one time Consul
General to Egypt, were married here
to-day in'fhe home of Mrs. George 11.
Pullman. After a wedding trip in the
South they win sail for the Philippines
in February, Lieutenant j Bankhead
having been ordered to report for duty
at Manila.
"Weds Son of a Congressman.
The men claim that the firm of Mil
ler & Lux has been discriminating
against the union for a long time and
a grievance has existed between the
firm and its union employes. The
men say that their employers have
been in the habit of discharging the
union employes whenever "an oppor
tunity offered itself and invariably
nÂ«n-union workmen have been em
ployed in the places of the union
butchers.**
Several days ago the matter was
reported to the Butchers' Union. On
Tuesday six of the union . butchers
walked out, acting under instructions
from the union. Their plea was that
as long as the firm of Miller & Lux
â¢v&b bent on discharging the <> union
hands they would quit their positions.
This morning, when the remaining
seven union employes of the firm
heard of what had occurred they de
cided to quit and accordingly walked
out in a body. Their places have not
yet been flllHjl, but the management
of Miller & Lux states thai it will ex
perience no "trouble in securing help.
Most of the men who walked out
found employment awaiting them in
other slaughter-houses. Others left
the city at once, intending to take a
vacation. Good men are needed In
Butchertown at the present time, say
the butchers, and therefore they claim
that they need not remain idle for a
day if they choose to go to work.
The union butchers employed by
Miller & Lux at the firm's Butcher
town slaughter-house have left their
places. Seven of them walked out in
a body yesterday morning out of sym
pathy with six. of their brethren who
quit on the previous day. No trouble
or disturbance of any kind attended
the walkout of the men arid the meat
trade in general will not be affected.
tinuing the work of cleaning China
town to make the district sanitary.
Secretary Emery of the Health Board
stated that It would take eighteen
men thirty days to finish wrecking un
sanitary buildings and that necessary
material had used up the balance of
previous funds.
The mine In dispute is said to b*e ex
ceedingly valuable. The property was
practically unworked for twenty-four
years. The Interested parties are now
experiencing trouble in getting men to
work in the mine, as the fumes from
the native quicksilver salivate them.
Then suit was brought against Hunt
ington. the patentees and other grantees
by the excluded ten to enforce the trust
created by the wrongful issuing of the
patents to the five, who were William
S. Bell. Charles Bell, John W. Rock,
John D. Elwanger and J. Epperson,
and have them declared the trustees
of the excluded ten. During all this
time Huntlngton and his friends got
together and three months ago formed
a corporation known as the Socrates
Consolidated Mining Company. One
million shares were issued. They are
now selling these shares at 60 cents
each.
MINE IS VALUABLE.
The plaintiff in this . action alleges
that he came into possession of his part
of the property in 1S02. He alleges he
has owned it since 1875 through a
transfer from one of the patentees,
whose title was perfect.
In 1902 Pinney through his attorney
petitioned to have a trustee appointed
in place of Carr to execute the trust
that was unfulfilled by him. William H.
Humphrey was appointed such trustee,
and suit was brought against him to
execute the trust. On November IS,
1903, Judge Morrow rendered a decree
compelling the trustee to execute a
conveyance to Mr. Pinney, and on the
following day the trustee did so.
The present suit is brought to recov
er about 650 feet of the valuable prop
erty and an accounting of the proceeds
from the mitre.
It appears from the record in this
badly mixed case that F. A. Hunting
ton entered upon the property in 1900
on the theory that he was the holder of
a tax title. He commenced to work the
mine, and soon -learned that his title
was defective, and he brought suit
against the executrix of Carr's will,
and she disclaimed all interest in the
property. The Superior Court of So
noma County awarded the whole there
of to Huntlngton. Again he found his
title defective, and brought suit against
John Lloyd, president of the German
Savings and Loan Society, as assignee
of John A. Robinson, to quiet title.
That suit led to the cutting down of
the Huntington interest fully two
thirds.
One of the richest quicksilver mines
In the State is involved in the suit filed
by George M. Pinney Jr. against the
Socrates Consolidated Mining Company
in the United States Circuit Court yes
terday. The property in dispute is sti
uated in Sonoma County and Is valued
at $600,000. It covers a large section of
land and has been in litigation
many years. Judge Stanton L. Carter
and A. H. Ricketts represent the plain
tiff and are prepared to prove that
their client is the rightful owner of a
one-sixtieth rart of the property. The
plaintiff sues also to recover $10,000
damages for withholding the posses
sion of his alleged share from him.
The mine has an interesting history.
In 1S67 it was located by fifteen men,
each being entitled to 200 feet. In 1S74
five of the original locators, without
consulting the other ten, deeded to
William B. Carr one-fourth of the prop
erty in his own right and three-fourths
as trustee. The transfer of the prop
erty was to facilitate its sale for $250,
000, and if the sale was not made Carr
was to reconvey the property back
again. Carr failed to either pay the
money or reconvey the property, and
died in 1S97.

ANOTHEB OIL-PIPE LI1TE,
The petition of the Associated Oil
Company to lay an oil pipe line along
Kerry street to Third, to Townsend, to
the storage tank of the San Francisco
Gas Company was referred to the
Board of Works for investigation.
The protest of the property owners
Connor's motion that the petitions
f^r the repeal of the privilege be de
r.ied was carried unanimously by the
committee.
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday denied the petitions of the
t^.in FYaacisco Labor Council, Team
sters' Union and the City Front Fed
eration that the ordinance granting a I
tfftxr track privilege on Filbert street
to St. llary's Kelp Hospital be re

Fue because of the protests flted
,Â£ s <i * ns l . - -
The North . Central Improvement
Association and the Manufacturers' |
er.d Producers' Association filed peti
tions urging that the privilege be not ,
rescinded on the ground that spur
tracks are necessary for great indus
trial enterprises. Frank Kelly, attor- ;
n<Â°y for the property owners on Fil
,bert street, between East and San
fome, protested against the laying of
the track, claiming that the cars
would be left on the streets and thus
create a nuisance, impede traffic and
be dangerous to pedestrians.
SAFETY OF PEDESTBIANS.
"The property owners who are now
protesting; will in less than a year
probably be asking for spur track
yrivileges." said Chairman Curtis of
.the committee.- "They will not con
rider the safety of pedestrians when
tbjj ask for the privilege. The cars
should be removed from the street as
soon ' elÂ« unloaded."
"Mr. Kelly should prepare . an or
dinance," said Garret McEnerney, at
torney for St. Mary's Help Hospital,
requiring the owners of spur tracks
to lay the rails into the warehouses
end the cars to be kept off the streets.
"We have been here twice upon the
matter and we wish it disposed of.
"We want to get our permit from the
Board of Works."
Attorney Myers, representing the
Linemen's Union, and Attorney Sutro
of the company will confer in the mean
time, and if Myers decides to protest
against the ordinance it will be with
drawn. Myers at first opposed the
granting of the extension because other
corporations had refused to comply
with the ordinance and were preparing
to contest Us validity. Myers said lives
of linemen were Being lost owing to the
dangerous proximity of live wires and,
while admitting the justice of the tele
phone company's petition, was averse
to allowing hostile corporations to ben
efit by the extension. Myers said -the
linemen were endeavoring to arrange
a conference with the corporations in
an effort. to make an amicable adjust
ment.
pany an extension of one 'year from
January 12. 1904, within which to com
ply with the terms of the ordinance re
quiring safeguards in the placing of
hig-h voltage electric wires oh poles and
crossarms. Attorney Sutro stated that
the company had been delayed in the
Â¦work on account et the strike and the
extension was needed.
The pa!nt shop connected with the
coast division of the Southern Pacific
Company on Kentucky street was
destroyed by fire early last even
ing-. Eight passenger coaches that were
in the building were burned to the
trucks and several more were saved by
the efforts of a yard crew that hauled
them from reach of the flames. The
loss will approximate 535,000. The
building oontcining machinery for gen
eral repairs was saved.
Shortly before 8 o'clock a double
alarm of fire was sounded from the box
at Fourth and Kentucky streets, and
when the department arrived the en
tire paint ehop was In flames. Efforts
were then turned toward saving the
machine shops and the rolling stock
In the yards and adjacent to the burn-
Ing structure. Engineer R. Gardner
and Superintendent of Yards M. O.
Randall ran a locomotive close enough
to save ten cars that stood on a track
to the east of the building, and in do-
In? so all the cab windows of the loco
motive were cracked by the heat and
the woodwork Scorched. A strong
westerly wind that was blowing is all
that prevented the coaches, which in
cluded Feveral Pullmans, from being
destroyed before the engine could be
coupled to them.
Before half an hour had passed the
structure and the eight cars were in
ruins and several streams played upon
embers. The story told by the railroad
men is to the effect that the fire broke
out on the east side of the building and
spread rapidly. There were several
explosions of paints and oils, but no
one was injured. The greatest danger
was from live wires and traffic on the
Kentucky-street car line was not re
sumed for several hours. Carelessness
on the part of some painter who left
the building at 6 o'clock Is supposed to
have been the cause of the fire.
HELENA, Mont, Dec. 3.â The Judi
ciary Committee of the House to-day
reported two substitute bills for the
original bill3 providing for a so-called
fair-trial law and relating to the pow
ers of the Supreme Court with refer
ence to reviewing testimony In equity
casesby the higher court. The Housa
adjourned until to-morrow, when de
bate will begin on the proposed IÂ«els
lation.
- Present Indications are that there will
not be a fight of consequence on the so
called fair-trial bill. (nor on the propo
sition to give the Supreme Court pow
er to review the testimony. Indeed.
Representative John MacGlnniss, F.Au
gustus Heinze's chief lieutenant, has
himself introduced a bill providing for
the review of evidence. The main
problem that confronts the Legislature
fs to draft the laws in such a way that
they will stand the test of the Supreme
Court on constitutional grounds*. All
the legfslators appear to be desirous of
passing a fair-trial bill, but there is
some difference of opinion concerning
the framing of the law. a fair-trial
bill was passed at the regular session
last year, but failed to be effective be
cause the Supreme Court declared It
unconstitutional In its construction.
The Lindholm woman, closely ques*
tioned by the police,, said Bonier told
her the old couple had sold the house
to him and that they had gone to a
house of refuge to spend the remain^*
der of" their lives. The gold found
on her, she insisted, had been given
her by Bonier.
On Tuesday - Bonier . appeared at
the Police Court in response to a sum
mons in a Joe Doe proceeding regard
ing the disappearance of the Frehrs.
The case was adjourned and Bonier
was ordered to appear in court yester-.
day, but he did not attent.- It was then
that the suspicion of foul play grew
stronger with the police, who had be
lieved up to that time that the old
couple had been taken away by rela
tives who hoped to inherit their
money.
Descriptions of Bonier wece sent
broadcast and this morning Police Su
perintendent Bull received a telephone
message from - Erie, Pa., statins that
Bonier had been arrested there. Bon
ier is 65 years old.
Bonier's housekeeper, Louise Llnd
holm, is in custody" in this city. The
police found on he person gold pieces
to the value of $70., The Frehrs were
supposed to have a 'great deal of gold
In the house. The woman says the
money was given to her by Bonier. .
Kate Kahm. a relative of the Llnd
holm woman, was also taken to a, po
lice station, a trunk and some stuff
which had belonged to the . Frehrs
having been found at her home. .
The Frehrs ownetf another house
and lot besides their home in Jeffer
son street and had money In the bank.
It was well known in the neighbor
hood* that they kept large sums of
money in their home.
BUFFALO. N. Y., Dec. 3. â The bod
ies of Franz Frehr and his wife, an
ajjed couple who disappeared from
their .home, 339 Jefferson street, on
November 20, ; were found' buried be
neath a woodshed in the yard back of
their house They had been murdered.
The skulls of both had been crushed,
and a hammer, such as would
have inflicted the blows, was found In
the shed. Several hairs were found
clinging 1 to the head of the hammer.
A search for Charles Bonier, who
moved into the house of the iTrehrs
on the day of their disappearance, had
been begun hours before the finding
of the bodies, but the hunt was renew
ed by the entire staff of headquarters
detectives as soon as word came that
the bodies of the old couple had been
found.

Two young men. George Barrow,
â¢on of ex-Superior Judge H. C. Bar
row of 2303 Telegraph avenue, and
Louis Long:, an ex-convict and son of
Mrs. Lillian Long of 2307 Telegraph
avenue, were arrested on charges of
burglary at Berkeley station this
morning by Marshal Kerns. The spe
cific charges against the accused is
that of breaking into the Tesla Coal
Company's barn and stealisg aome
sacks, though they are suspected of
being the fellows who have been crm
mitting many burglaries around town
of late.
Marshal Kerns has been watching
the men since Handle's jewelry store
was robbed, about four months ago.
as they are suspected of having been
implicated in that affair. The methods
used in the subsequent burglaries werÂ«
similar to those employed in thÂ«
jewelry store raid, and through cer
tain circumstances Long and Barrow
were connected with them. Marshal
Kerns was unable, however, to secure
any direct evidence. : /
The cue to the train of events that
led to the capture cf the men was con
veyed to Marshal Kerns by a con
versation he overheard. This was in
regard to some 200 sacks that were
stolen from the Tesla Company's barn
at University avenue and Stanford
place. By means of the clew he was
able to find where the sacks had been
disposed of to a. junk dealer, and from,
the junk dealer he was able- to learn
the identity of the men who sold the
sacks.
With this Information In hand and
sure of his men Marshal Kerns arrest
ed Long and Barrow this morning at
Berkeley station, their usual haunt.
They were taken before Justice Ed
gar, who fixed their ball at $1000 cash
each, and set the preliminary exami
nation for next Tuesday. In lieu of
the bail the prisoners werÂ« taken to
the County Jail.
Barrow comra of a. good family. His
father was formerly Superior Judg*
in Oregon, and Dr. Jennie Barrow, his
stepmother. Is a trell-known physician
in Berkeley. Neither parent nor step
parent Is inclined to assist youn;
Barrow in his trouble, declaring that
they have repeatedly warned him
against keeping company with evil as
sociates, so that he la not entitled to
their support.

Conditions and prices In the fruit market
showed but little changi from the previous re
port. Apples and Oranges' constituted thjs
bulk of the supplies and the demand was
light both locally and for shipping account.
There was less activity In Apples, but prices
of all grades were unchanged. Trade In Or
anges was of a light jobbing character and
confined to email parcels of well-colored stock.
Receipts are steadily increasing, but the fruit
still lacks color and buyers and sellers dif
fer widely In their views. Grape Fruit- was
In fair request, while Lemons and Limes were
in heavy supply and dull. Supplies of B?rr!es
\verÂ» just about sufficient to satisfy the de
mand and prices had but slight variation.
Quinces. Persimmons and Pomegranates were
in fall 'request and stood about the same as
previously quoted. Receipts of Grapes, whllÂ»
light were ample and choice offerings fourvd
ready sale at good figures. Ripe Bananas were
still rather scarce and ruled firm at the pre

NEW YORK, Dec. 3.â The stock market
broke into great animation to-day and devel
oped much strength with obvious distress on
the part of r.hcrt, interests. The volume of
dealings rose to the r.elghborhcod of a million
shares. The activity was progressive, the
es.riy part of the day being given over to Inter
mittent buying movements, with Intervals of
extreme dullness. The strength of tbe first
part of the day was also confined to a tew spe
cial .stocks and was interrupted by occasional
selling movements to take profits even in tht*e
stocks. There was a large number of the
stocks of the first prominence which did not
come into the upward movement at all. Near
ly all of the Western stocks were laggards rn
til late in the day. and the cotton carrying
mads had no share in the day's activity at.d
strength. Even the movement in Pennsyl
vania, which became of decisive influence, waÂ«
late In developing, and that stock was one cf
the many which were below last night in the
early reaction. The few industrials which
spurted upward in a sensational manner in the
closing dealings yesterday were Inclined vo re
action on profit-taking. Colorado Fuel lost two
full points as the result of. an intended bond
issue. Sugar lost a point on profit tak
ing acd Amalgamated Copper was a frac
tion below Ust night at one time. The ex
tensive advertising of predictions of an ad
vance in Amalgamated Copper aroused some
suspicion toward it, but the stock came Into
the late upward movement. Canadian Paciflc
Buffered from the report cf a new issue of capi
tal. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the up
ward movement of prices gathered momentum
and volume as the day proceeded and was ef
fective in alarming a more important short In
terest than has yet been rerx>rtf>d since the
turn from the extreme depression of the mar
ket. The- causes cf the advance were raiher
obscure, but vague assertions were freely circu
lated of a large and determined absorption erf
stocks' by the various groups of graat capital
ists and l-anks whlcn made vp the <ic-Tnln:int
powers in the financial world. The Ions Mand
lnij rumor of an adjustment of the dispute be
t-A-.-?.i the Gould and Pennsylvania interei-t
fed eagerly on the report that the counsel for
the Western Union and Pensyivania had s greed
that no further cutting cf poles should take
place pending a decision of the question in
controversy. In a general way there was un
doubtedly an improve-d sentiment over the In
dustrial and financial outlook; Opinions were
heard that the worst of tlie reaction In Iron
and ste-.-l had been seen, with good hopes of
Improvement. Call money loaned again as
high as 7% ner cent, and the movement of
currency to New Orleans continue?, but addi
tional engagements jaf po ld In London for both
Boston anJ New York account offered the as
surance that actuil necessities can be provided
for.

, Dealers quoted a very weak Butter market
yesterday. The weakness is due more to dull
ness In trade than to large receipts, for the
latter ore moderate at the moment. Most of
the depression Is" In the Marin Butter, as al
ready mentioned, as the Humboldt creameries
are holding up better. Stocks continue unev
enly distributed, half a dozen houses carrying
the lion's share of spot stock. These houses
are cutting quotations to work oft their sur
plus, but - contrary to the usual result the
lower quotations fall to stimulate trade.
There Is no change In Cheese, which contin
ues oterplentlful.
Eggs arrived more heavily, as will be seen,
and a lower market was quoted. Most deal

A LUCID REVIEW OF THE CURRENT
BUSINESS SITUATION.
The New York circular or Henry Clews say*:
Â¦"Thank^siving hclldajs naturally tended to re
rtrk-1 etock market operations, but In spite
of this conf.drnte i? rising and a better under
tone pervade* the "street.' This no doubt Is
partly due to manipulation; yei a m- nth ago
renditions would not have permitted such ma
nipulations, end the mere fact that they are
Â»vfn attempted demonstrates a change of feel
ing and Judgment ameng those behind the
â¢"The mcÂ»t noteworthy feature in the mar
ket Â«u the differentiation between railroad
#harrÂ» and the industrials; the latter being
Â«rrk and irregular, while the former *vere
generally strong and scored unexpected recov
eries. Af already intimated in these advices,
this was the inevitable result of exhausted
liquidation and improved financial condition?.
The whole trouble had ct-ntered in Wall street,
ar.d any Improvement there was certain to be
reflected in values of securities having intrinsic
merit behind them. It is quite likely that
thÂ» bull contincent seixed the -flr*t opportu
nity fcr lifting the market â an opportunity
long detired: and there Is no doubt they haJ
thÂ» moral if not the actual Â«upi>ort of bie
banking interests who have large amounts of
desirable new issues which they expect to float
very shortly.
Â¦â¢In this connection it is wcrth noting that
the rtilroad Fituatlcn continues very patisfac
tOT- Earnings ere larger than previous ban
ner \ears. and many of the well-known roads
â¢ r* earning rr.uch in excess of present divi
dends. One thing is as sure as any business
cccfiition can be. and that iÂ« that there will
be no reduction in the dividends qf the well
e*tabllsbed and well-iracag*d railroads, the
margin of profit being already so ample that
a moderate contraction of expenses or im
provements will insure the etablllty of divi
dends. In many instances the enormous out
lay* for reconstruction, etc.. paid out of
earnings will soon rease altogether, and this
may result In bringing some of the non-dlvi
der.d payer* Into the regular dividend list.
Such tact* a* these have been temporarily lost
â¢ight of in the f.ocd cf disaster and despond
ency which nwept through the Stock Exchange
during th^ closing year.
POOR CONDITION" OF INDUSTRIALS.
"Unfortunately the same cannot be said of
the industrials. They are not as a rule in the
strong financial and physical condition of the
railroad*. Handicapped by overcapitalization
and bed financing, they are in poor position
to face any decided ehrir.kage in profits. Of
course this if nothing new, and has long
been foreseen. In the case of steel the Inev
itable hai> already happened, and it remains to
be seen how other industrials will weather the
â¢term when it comes. Fortunately these, ee
ruritieii are chiefly in the hands of their crea
tor*. They have not been very successfully
unloaded upon the dear public. Commlsslon
hcuse* are practically bare of euch etocke, and
the backs accerit them as collateral to a very
limitr-d extent. It follow*, therefore, that any
Fhrink&ge in these must have a limited market
effect, considering their volume; the railroad
list having already declared it*, independence
r>t the industrials. Such lOFses. as already
eatd. rr.uft fall most heavily upon the original
huidera. seme of whom have failed to eecure
profit* once possible, and some who have
been cbllge-d to sacrifice gilt-edged securities
to meet their obligation* connected with ln
duttrUls.
"This !a*t sort of liquidation, however. Is
about ever, and It :* qufte likely to appear
that the stock market has overdiscounted the '
industrial ultuation, especially In view of Hie
fact that there is no business reaction of im
portance yet lr sight. Induetry has simply
reached the toiÂ» wave; it cannot plunge clear
to the tottom in a few short months, and the
<1<-cllnÂ» will be gradual. A# in the rase of
the- eteel trade, price concession* will develop
new ojder* held back fur just Â»uch opportu
nities Should labor follow a prudent aod
reasonable ixi'foy. accepting Its *hare of the
inevitable reaction, the consequences will Ijc
â¢ ley* *eriou* to all concerned and should re
Â»ult in continued prosperity upon a more mod
erate and rwrmanent basis that lately experi
enced. Next year rhould find us upon more
folid ground than in 1!K(2 or 190C?.
MONETARY OUTLOOK.
"Tne monetary outlook 1*. growing more fa
vorable. Preparations for the $50,000,000 Pan
*ir.3 canal payment, of course, exert an im
portant effect upon the international exchanges,
and are likely to materially check gold Im
ports, which thus far have aggregated about

End of the Tidal Wave.
The old bark Tidal Wave, for years one
of the busiest and luckiest of vessels In the
coastwise trade. haÂ» been turned over to a
wrecking -concern to be broken up and disposed
of as Junk. Her last owner was J. C. Eschen,
and his action In having the old bark broken
up now Instead of keeping her In commission
until she roes to pieces, possibly at the cost
of much human life. Is highly commended In
the local marine world. 6he was built in
18Â© at Port Madison and her thirty-four years
of service kave been wonderfully clear of
mishap.

Chris Fields, formerly boatswain of
the steamship City of Puebla, was con
victed yesterday by a jury in the Unit
ed States District Court for
twenty 5-tael tins of opium from Vic
toria on October 14. The opium was
found conceaied on his person as he
v as leaving the vesseL Fields was or
dered to- appear this morning for sen
tence. His defense was that he had
bought the opium in Seattle, and there
fore had not smuggled It. The drug
Tras manufactuivd in Victoria, B. C,
and did not bear the Government
stamp. Duncan E. McKinlay, who rep
resented the prosecution, argued* that
the opium bein^ unstamped and that
Fields concealed it upon his person
were facts clearly showing guilty
knowledge.

The new^cruiser Tacoma had a chance to
show her seaworthy qualities at tbe end of
the trip home from Santa Barbara. When the
bar was reached It was found to be breaking
and it was only after arave consideration that
the crossing waÂ« essayed. Huge combers spent
their noisy strength against the cruiser's sides,
which yielded before the mighty Impact until
at times the Tacoma rested on her beam ends.
The sea had been fairly rough all the way
up the coast, but when the bar was reached
the tumbling and tossing waÂ» In a style .that
would have done credit to a fullpower ocean
gale. The cruiser came through this un
scheduled trial as well as she had passed the
official tests In the Santa Barbara channel,
but the crockery on board was wrecked and
the caterer who supplied the china and crystal
for use on the trial trip had little of his ware
to carry home. In addition to the breakables
ererythinsr that was loose in ev.ery part of
the cruiser went adrift and the movable in
terior arrangement of the Tacoma waÂ« in a
pretty jumble when the amooth seas inside
the heads gave those aboard an opportunity
to look around.

The Japanese steamship Hongkong
Maru sailed yesterday for the Orient,
crowded . with passengers and loaded
down to her Plimsoll marks with val
uable cargo. . Among her passengers
were many army officers going to join
their ' regiments in the Philippines.
The crowd that thronged the wharf
included a liberal sprinkling of army
and navy people; in fact, the service
could hardly liave been better rep
resented had the departing liner been
one of Uncle Sam's own transports.
A large number of civilian employes
of the Government also sailed on the
Hongkong. They will take another
steamship at Hongkong for Manila.
The Hongkong carried 3S00 tons of
cargo, which was so stowed as to trim
the liner like the racing yacht she
resembled as she glided down the
bay toward the Golden Gate.
The Hongkong took away fifty Chi
nese passengers and . two deported.
Most of the Celestial passengers had
secured their berths during the rate
cutting duel with the China Commer
cial Company and are now traveling
on a palatial liner at an expense for
the entire passage of $2 apiece. Chi
nese going on the next boat, the Chi
na, will have to pay $35 for their
transportation.
The Hongkong's passengers includ
ed the folowing named:

CHEYENNE. Wyo.. Dec. 3.â A dispatch re
ceived from Chicago to-day . says that the di
rector" of the North American Copper Com
pany 'have raised $250,000 for improvements
at Encampment. Wyo.. which will include re
building of the aerial tramway tha 1â¢*"*
in the world: alterations In the reduction
works and extenplve developments of the .Fer
rls-Haggarty mine.
"By whose orders?" Wescott claims
to have replied when threatened by
Amea.
"By mine," Ames is said to have re
plied, and Wescott. rather, he says,
than cause more trouble, gracefully re
tired.
Wescott also avers in his petition
that he appeared at the meeting place
of the harbor at the meeting following
his suFpenpinn, held November 30. He
says he was requested to retire by
Captain Ames, and refused to do so,
and was told that he would be put out.
The session should be an interesting
one. for the reason that Wescott's pe
tition shows that he has been making
a determined effort ever since his sus
pension to take a hand in the manage
ment of the affairs of the association.
It further shows that hÂ« is a candidate
for the office of clerk to the captain of
the association, a position now held by
R. N. Rlppy, and that the election of
officers will take plare at the next
meeting. His absence, he says, v wlll
cause him the loss of many votes and
means his defeat.
"Shut uz>.~ sal <3 Captain Ames.
â¢I -wor/t," said Captain Wescott.
"You are puspended," retorted Ames.
"I an not," shot back Wescott.
And thereupon the members of Call- ;
fornla. Harbor No. 15 of the Association
cif Masters and Pilots were called upon
to setae the controversy. Fourteen Jolly
tars stood uj> at the call of Captain
.Anns and voted to suspend Wescott.
Eight sons of Neptune voted the other
â¢nay. and Wescott lost the right to take
part in the deliberations of the body.
AH this occurred at a meeting of the
masters and pilots at the ferry build-
Ing on the night of November 23.
of the row between the men
Â¦who go down to the sea in ships would
have been known to the world at large
if it were not for the fact that that
doughty mariner Captain Wescott re
fuses to etay suspended and has ap
pealed to the courts.
Yesterday he filed a petition for a
Â¦writ of mandate compelling Captain
Ames and the other officers of the har
l>or to allow him to take part in the
sneeting o? the harbor to be held next
3Jonday night. In this petition he
states that the row occurred as above
stated, and unon his statement Judge
ilurasky issued an alternative writ,
returnable before Judg<? Seawell next
â¢Monday morning. At that time the de
fendants in the suit, Captain Ames and
the other officers of the harbor and the
fourteen mariners who voted against
"Wescott, are to appear and show cause
â¢why Wescott should not have the relief
he asks for.
A man from Modesto was relieved of
$40 by the same process the day pre
vious, and there are others. C. C.
Crowley, chief of the Southern Pacific
detective bureau, detailed Patrick Kln
delon on the case, and yesterday morn
ing Kindelon caught Talbert in the act
of bunkoing a long whiskered stranger
on the train near Crocket^. Talbert's
companion escaped, but Kindelon has
a good description of him. Talbert was
brought to the citv and turned over
tc Detective. Ryan, who locked him up
in the City Prison."
J-'R- Talbert, who is accused of play
ing a bunko game on passengers on
the Southern Pacific trains between
this city and Port Costa, is in the City
Prison and every effort is being made
to find his confederate.
Complaints had ' been made to . the
Southern Pacific officials of the crooked
work of the two men. Mr. and Mrs.
Morrow, an aged couple from Orange.
Cal., who had been on a visit to the
city, left on their return trip last Tues
day. Soon after they left the Oakland
mole a nicely dressed young man took
a seat beside them and engaged them
in conversation. They chatted for
about half an hour, when another
nicely dressed young man came up to
them and. slapping the other young
man on the back, asked him if he
cculd give him the $100 he" owed him.
.Of course he did not have the" money
and in an off-hand way asked the old
man lf^he could advance him the
amount, saying ir would be sent to him
at once.' The old man refused, but his
wife, who had been much impressed by
the young 1 man's conversation, pulled
out her own wallet and handed him
the money. That was ; the last they
saw of either of the young men.
William H. Glover shot Frederick
Nierhoff in Placer County .on June 11.
1902. Glover was engaged to the daugh
ter of his victim, but the father had
ordered him off the premises. He be
came enraged and next day appeared
in the yard with a rifle for the express
purpose of . killing Nierhoff. The last
named was shot in attempting to wrest
the rifle from Glover.
The appeal was based on alleged ir
regularities in the conduct of the case
by the Judge of the trial court. â¢
The daughter of ' Hugh Duffy saw
Charles Wardrip murder her father and
Agnes NIerboff was present when Wil
liam H. Glover shot her father.
Wardrip shot down Hugh Duffy In
February, 1902 r near the corner of Four
teenth and G streets in Sacramento.
The defendant, with a boyish com
panion, was in the act of burglarizing
the residence of a family by the name
of Bartell, when Duffy, who owned the
house, appeared on the scene. Wardrip
leaped ! from a window after he' had
been alarmed by his companion and
shot Duffy. ...
He managed to make his escape from
California, but was located in Salt
Lake City and brought back for trial.
He was convicted and sentenced to
death. His appeal was based on tech
nical points. Â¦ :
Charles Wardrip and "William H.
Glover must die on the scaffold,; ac
cording to decisions rendered in their
respective cases by the Supreme Court
yesterday. Both of the men have made
hard fights for life and both have lost.
Executive clemency is all that'can save
them now. .

John Burton' and William Rell went
into C. P. "Kelly's store, 217_Grant av
enue, yesterday afternoon and pur
chased a^silk" waist. As they were
leaving, Burton quietly took another
waist and shoved -it under his over
coat. The act was observed" and he
and Rell were detained till Policeman'
Jordan - arrived. Burton was booked
at the City Prison on a charge of petty
larceny. When Rell was searched,- a.
skeleton key was found in his pocket
and he was booked for having it in his
possession. The police say that Rell
is- a. clever manipulator of slot ma

Wanted Another Waist.
James Michens, a colored sailor, was
arrested last night by Patrolmen Skain
and O'Brien and booked on a charge
of an assault with a deadly weapon.
During an altercation over a woman
in Maps' saloon, 439 Pacific street,
Michens slashed j Joe , Williams, also
colored, with a pocketknife. Williams
received the knife thrust in the back
and a leather belt he wore no doubt
saved him .from serious injury. His
assailant made several attempts to
stab him and as a result his clothing
was cut in several places. Williams
repaired to the Harbor Hospital for
treatment and was able to leave the
institution unassisted after having his
wounds dressed. .

I then said that- 1 would open my . business
anyhow, and that. If necessary, I would go to
Oakland to procure my stocks of fruits and
vegetables. The threat jwas met wlih the
statement that steps wouid' be taken to boy
cott ire over there, and the declaration was
sternly made that the association would ueo
to -it that I did not succeed* in carrying on
the produce business at 122 N'inth street, so
long as my tra.le would Interfere with that of
any number of the assoclatlcn whose stand
was within a. block of mine.
The result, has been that I urn prevented from
carrying on the fruit and vegetable branch of
my buslr.ee?. â¢ I can ;obtain no stocks in these
lines ;owing to the >Jgorous boycott that has
l>*eii '/established' against me.

stand; he declared that he was willing

CRANE'S TESTIMONY.
W. P. Crane, a restaurant man of
538 Sixth-street, testified that he had
tried to start a fruit stand during the
month rtf September ana was refused
goods by the commission merchants of
this city.,. . .. v V. . ,
"Why,"; he said. ."I went down with
$100 in my pocket, to purchase the stock
and met with a refusal to sell all along
the line." Crane .mentioned several
names of those who refused, to sell him
goods arid among them, were the firms
of -L. Scatena & Co., 104 -Washington
street: J. Ivancovich & Co., 209 Wash
ington street, and Mitchell ft Goodall,
308 Washington street.' Crane stated
that his dealings were in the city and
not on the wharves, but cited his case
merely, to showthe existence of a com
bine.-,. He was told.. when he went to
purcha'se the goods that he could not
open a fruit store in the block picked
out by him as there was another man
there already who was a- member of
the association. He was refused ad
mission to the association.
\ Commissioner. Spear said that they
would instruct the attorney of the
board to take evidence from* the retail
men-.and such other- evidence as could
be secured and- prefer specific charges
against the commission men for a vio
lation of the Woodward law and serve
summons on them citing them to ap
pear next Monday. -
â¢ Commissioner . Kirkpatrick objected
to this plan and 'said:, "I think that
we have a 1 right -to revoke permits un
der the provisions of the permits which
give us tlie right to Inquire into , the
methods of the : produce ;dealers using
the State wharves/ If they refuse to
be examined we I have ' the right to re
voke the permits." . ,
Mr. Spear, agreed to Mr. Klrkpat^
rick's ruling, and the provisions of the
application ' for a permit were read.
They are as follows :
Â§>I (or we),, expectlngto receive consignments
of . perishable products to' be; delivered by car
rier on . the wharves "or other property of the
State of California In the city and county of
San Francisco, and desiring to dispose of the
name before removal, hereby make application
tor. a permit to , be : valid < for one year from
date of issue, to sell perishable products on
said wharves or other' State property.
' In" consideration of the receipt of such permit
I . (or. we) ' promise., to faithfully observe all of
the* regulations which are or may be prescribed
by . the. State/ Board -'of Harbor Commissioners
In regard to Cue h sales, and In particular I (or
we) agree . that I (or ; we) Â¦ will not during the
life of such permits be ; a party r to any . con
spiracy/agreement or - understanding whereby
I (or j we) shall refuse to sell to any solvent pur
chaser or buy from any t person whatever, and
I' (or we) agree that I (or we) will sell impar
tially, and .at 'the same prices.to all who desire
to purchase, for /cash.' "without regard to their
business; or -Intended .disposition of- the prod
ucts, and will- exercise no discrimination what-*
ever, between buyers and sellers.. by reason of
their occupation, affiliations or non-afflllatlons.
I (or j we) also agree that' In case of | violation
of this , agreement*. the. Board ' of ; State Harbor,
Commissioners Â¦ may 'revoke, the permit hereby
perishable goods on the wharves of
this city?" asked Attorney Davis.
"Xo, sir," replied the commission
merchant, "I don't think so."
"You don't think so? Then there is
a doubt in your mind?"
"No, I know that I have not," Wolf
then replied.
"Since the issuance of your permit
have you been party to any conspiracy,
agreement or understanding whereby
you refused to buy from any one per
ishable goods on the State wharves?"
asked Davis. ',. - ...
"I have put my position on paper and
I think that. I ought to be granted the
time I ask," replied Wolf.
"Have you refused to sell to any one
perishable goods on the State
wharves?"
"I decline to answer on the ground
that I have stated -my-case on paper."
"Then, Mr. Wolf, you refuse to an
swer these questions?"
"I do. We have not had proper time
to put our cape before the commis
sion."
"TouHiave had a week's time," said
Kirkpatrick.
Wolf was then excused and John G.
Wetmore of the % firm of Wetmore
Bros, was placed on the stand. He de
nied that he had sold goods on i the
State property, in violation of the law.
Outside of what had taken place on
State : property he declined to testify.
Commissioner Kirkpatrick , then
asked: ; "Did, you cell perishable
products at the "store and send men to
get the goods on the wharf?"
"No, sir, I have not?" replied Wolf.
Wetmore | pleaded for more time in
which to present the case and refused
to answer the same questions,: that
Wolf did. He was excused.
GIANNINI TESTIFIES.
A. P. Giannini, vice president of the
firm of L. Scatena* & Co., testified that
his firm had never been guilty of re
fusing to sell to any solvent purchaser
or of refusing to buy of any one on ac
count of his affiliation or non-affiliation
with any association. He also denied
that he had ever . made a deal at his
store and then delivered the goods from
the wharves.
A. J. Runyon of -the firm of Mc-
Donough & Runyon followed Giannini
on the. stand. * "He said: "There is 'no
charge against me, and I refuse to an
swer any question regarding -my busi
ness transactioris.'on or off State prop-*
erty. I don't want to answer a general
charge. Unless specific <Â¦ charges are
preferred against me I. refuse to .an
swer any questions." ..'.._ I ;,
Commissioner Kirkptarick then told
Runyon that the law gave the commis
sion the power to | compel the holders
of permits to appear for, hearing before
the board after giving them due notice.
The section. of the law in question was
then read, as follows:'
"In case of violation of his agreement
by the holder of any permit, the Board
of State Harbor Commissioners upon a
hearing, after giving due notice to, all
parties concerned and finding the" fact
of such violation, shall revoke and can
cel the permit, and shall not issue a
new permit to the offending party ex
cept upon a new execution of the
agreement herein set forth and the
payment of a fee of $50, . and the right
to receive a r\ew permit shall rest in
the discretion of said Board - of State
Harbor Commissioners."
Runyon was excused, and John G.
Polito of- 512. Valencia' street, secretary
of the Retail Fruit Dealers' Associa
tion of San Francisco, was * placed - on
the Â«tand.
Commissioner Spear asked Polito the
same questions that had been put to
the preceding witnesses. Polito said:
"I have been cited to appear here, and
as we have asked no permits of your
board and do not sell on the wharves
I don't see that the commission has
any right to inquire into the business
of the association. Therefore I refuse
to answer any questions. I know noth
ing of any combine such as has been
referred to."
Commissioner Kirkpatrick in reply to
Polito's statement said: "Your argu
ment is not good ground for refusal to
answer questions. A man might be a
witness in a murder. trial, or may have
killed a man, and still say that he knew
nothing about the case. That would
not stop the trial."
Commissioner Spear then asked:; "Do
you know of any violation whereby the
commission men refused to sell perish
able goods to any one on State prop
erty?" '
"I do not think so. whether the per
son belonged to the Retail Fruit Deal
ers' Association or not."' was the reply.
"Nor refused to buy?"
"No."
GRAVES' AFFIDAVIT.
A lone affidavit had been filed by J.
N. Graves of 122 Ninth street, propri
etor of the Standard Produce and Poul
try Company. The substance of the
affidavit was that he opened his. place
for trade on November 21 last, but
that he had not been able to procure
any stock of fruits or vegetables to
sell owing to the refusal of the whole
sale houses to sell them to him, not
withstanding that ;he ivas able and
willing to bay the. market prices pre
vailing and that he' was not, denied
goods because of any question of being
able to meet his accounts.- He called
between the 15th and. 18th of"Npvem
ber, bo he deposed,' on L. Scatena &
Co., and applied to Mr. Hahley, man
ager of the house, for goods, and was:
informed by . Hahley thaf'as' he
(Graves) was not; a member of \ the Re
tall Fruit Dealers' Association he (Han
ley) could not sell, the desired fruit and
vegetables, as the retailers' associa
tion would not permit sales to those
Who held no card of membership. -The
same experience, so deposed , Graves,
met him at the .wholesale houses .'of
Von Husen & ..Co. \ and IvancQvich. &
Co. and at Garcia' & MagglniV store. '
In part the affidavit of Graves , was
as follows: '.; . .- . ;
. It was explained to me by the 'wholesalers I
spoke, to "that no commission house in'the city
would let-me have Roods.' and that It would be
necessary. " f or , me- to Join the association before
I could think of engaging In the. produce*busi
ness in San Francisco. I waa advised by these
wholesale merchants to seek a membership In
the association, and all expressed '-" eagcrneM
to supply my store as soon as I could conform
'to the asrt*ments between. themselves .ind^the
retailers. â¢ ,...',...'Â¦
I therefore went to a meeting, of i the Retail
Fruit Dealers' Association, held . in Native
Sons' Hall, on Mason street, to apply for; ad
mission to the association. I appeared before
the â¢ organization while : it was In session. '^The
secretary, whose name I .believe to be- Pollto,
and the treasurer of /the' association, whose
name I do not know.' acted, as spokesmen In
making reply to my petition. They announced
that it was utterly Impossible for me to be
come a- member for -the reason that the store
of one of the members of the association was
located within Â¦. feet of my proposed \ place ;
that under no conditions. would I be allowed to
open a stand across-the street, ' as ! I Â¦ was seek
ing to do, from one already established and
owned by a member of the' association. Â¦'.
I offered to present a . petition from a â¢ great
majority of the people living in the ' vicinity, of
my store, asking that I be allowed to start my
business i there.'.' The'^ reply.'; was '-.thati-no such
effort, or any other, would be of avail.
TWO MEMBERS OF THE STATE BOARD OF HARBOR COMMISSIONERS, WHO YESTERDAY REVOKED THE
LICENSES OF FOUR WHOLESALE HOUSES. AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LATTER WHO AP
PEARED BEFORE THE BOARD. S*t
Regarding tjie recent disclosures of
fraud in the right-of-way department
of the road Mr. Clark said that the
company had figured that its losses,
resulting from the crooked transac
tions of its employes, amounted to
$7700. The suspected officials had been
forced to resign and no further trou
ble is expected.
| J. Ross Clark, vice president of the
' San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake
Railroad, is at the Palace Hotel, hav
ing just returned from Salt Lake,
where he was engaged in business con
nected with the company. While dis
cussing the progress being made in
the construction work from the Salt
Lake end of the new line last evening
he said:
"Unless, some unforeseen obstacle
arises the prediction made by Senator
Clark recently that the road will be
finished a year from next February
will certainly be fulfilled. Work is to
be rushed this winter and with that
pufpose In view we have been increas
ing our force of men all along the
route, j I was in Calientes several days
ago and 4 there they had already fin
ished sixteen miles of grading and the
tracks had been laid for about seven
miles. The mechanical track layer had
begun operations, and when I left it
was laying rails at the rate of about
5200 feet a day. '.' '
"There is no snow below Calientes
and the conditions are very favorable
for men to work throughout the entire
winter. At present there are about 600
men and 100 horses engaged there and
by the end of December we expect to
increase the force of men to between
1200 and 1500. During January, Febru
ary and March the company will prob
ably have 5000 men working at various
points along the route of the road,
especially in the desert sections, where
the heat of the summer makes labor
difficult."
J. Ross Clark Says the Labor Force
Will Soon Number Five Thou
sand Men.
RUSHING THE WORK
ON SALT LAKE ROAD
William H. Wolf of Wolf & Sons in
speaking for the produce dealers who
lost their permits said: "I think we
ought to be allowed to state our side

Bros. J. A. Eveleth, whose name ap
pears among those summoned, ihaving
no permit, is beyond the jurisdiction
of the board. The secretary will be
instructed to notify the chief wharf
inger, and the proper officers under him
will see that these firms do no more
business on the wharves of the State."
Attorney Davis, for the Commission
ers In regard to the board's action,
when asked if the Commissioners would
pursue the same course in atl cases of
a like nature said: "It appears by the
board's action that it intends to treat
all violators of the Woodward law the
same." ii^'J - .
J. Witt of 25 Elgin place made a plea
for the produce dealers and tried to
explain that the prices of fruits and
vegetables could neVer be fixed, as the
supply was changing every day. % "The
supply, be it large or small, fixes the
prices on these goods," said he.
The board then adjourned to the ex
ecutive chambers with its attorney and
returned in ten minutes. Commissioner
Spear said:
"I protest against the attempt to turn
this place into a courtroom. I speak
for the consumers â the people who are
being robbed every day by this pro
duce combine. It is not right to force
any man to prefer charges against this
combine. As soon as he does this he
is boycotted and loses his position. It
is not for the small dealers to prefer
the charges. It is for you Commission
ers to act."
J. F. Cowdery, an attorney, rose to
be heard. In reply to a question from
Commissioner Spear as to who he was.
the attorney became very Indignant
and paid that as an American citizen
he had a right to be heard.
Commissioner Spear explained that it
was only customary to gain a person's
name before allowing him to talk.
Quiet was restored and the attorney
was allowed to speak." -He said:

Anna , Ross, a white woman, who
was charged with complicity in the
murder of Elizabeth Leroy, colored,
was found guiUy of murder in the first
degree and her punishment fixed at
life imprisonment, by a Jury this after
noon. Victor Walkirez, a negro, and
her companion, was convicted of the
same crime and given the same pun
ishment by a jury some weeks ago.
The crime for which they. must pay
the penalty was committed at Golden
Gate on May 6. Mrs. Leroy, an aged
colored wpman, was killed and buried
under her home. A month later Anna
Ross informed the police. Walkirez
was captured at Hollister^after several
days' search. While she admitted see
ing the murder committed, the woman,
denied that she took any part in 1 it
and said it was done against her will.
Both are young yet, neither being 30
years of age. It was by the informa
tion Anna Ross g-ave to the police that
Walkirez was captured and later by
her evidence that he was convicted.
She did what she could to have him
hanged and he retaliated when her
trial came on and made his testimony
ag&inst her as strong as possible. A
number of notes written by them that
were intercepted while! they were both
being held in jail also helped make the
case strong against her. She will be
sent to San Quentin, as there are no
women at Folsom.

W. H. Wolf sat at the table with the
Commissioners at the beginning of the
proceedings. He was questioned by
Attorney Davis for the Commissioners.
Wolf pleaded for time to put the case
or the merchants on paper. Commis
sioners Spear and Kirkpatrick refused
to wait. Commissioner Mackenzie was
not present.
"Mr. Wolf, have you at any 'time
been party to any agreement, under
standing 1 or conspiracy in the selling of
Commissioner Kirkpatrick said, after
this had been read, that the board would
have to refuse to consider the commu
nication on the ground that the board
had a right to summon and examine,
at any time, any person holding the
permit of the board to sell perishable
products on the State's property.

Very little testimony was secured
fnm the representatives of the large
commission houses whose representa
tives had been cited to appear. At the
outset of the proceedings the board
was confronted with the following com
munication from W. H. Wolf. J. A.
Evclcth. J. G. Wetmore. A. J. Runyon
and A. Giannini.
DENY VIOLATING LAW.
A resolution was adopted in which
the revocation of the permits of the
four firms that have been mentioned
was effected and the secretary of the
board was instructed to notify the chief
wharfinger that they must not be al
lowed to do business on the State's
wharves or other State property in this
The hearing before the Commission
ers began at 10:30 a. m. At that hour
there was a score of men in the room.
These men were prominently connected
with the commission business. There
were also some others, who as citizens
watched the proceedings with the ex
pectation that the views of the Com
miw=ioners would be developed. In this
they were not disappointed. The
board, when it met with denials relat
ing to its jurisdiction to act under the
law and with refusals on the part of
the holders of permits to sell relative to
their observance of the legal provisions
forbidding conspiracies or agreements
in restraint of the sale and purchase of
perishable products, moved swiftly and
with decision.
