Guthrie first questioned j Dresser as to
the reports he . had ,' received or seen ' on'
the value of the plants included: in the
shipbuilding combination. Dresser: said
he had seen Â¦ the reports of Alexander
B. : Green and Riddle & Common, the ac
countants.
"From the time ' the prospectus was
first prepared 'until the transaction was
finally consummated, had there been any
thing suggested to you that affected the
soundness of the company?"
-.' "I -suspected, nothing 'until I came back
from Europe," said _ Dresser. â¢ "I made a
very caref ul inquiry at that time. ' Trou
ble occurred during January and;Febru
ary ami I: believe it was due to the {con
trol by Mr. Schwab of the . Bethlehem
Company.""- ;Â¦<

holders' Protective Associa
tion, was resumed to-day and was pro
duclve of developments that will claim
the attention of the financial world and
those Who follow its fortune.
It developed that yesterday D. Leroy
Dresser, late president ;of.th^Trust Com
pany of the . v Republic, \ who ?:last' "week'
divulged much of- the inner history, of
the formation of the combination, made
in effort to' communicate with Charles
M. Schwab with a view of obtaining some
concessions as to the Bethlehem Steel
Works that would render easier the
scheme for rehabilitating the partly
wrecked concern. The message of Dres
ser was delivered to Schwab by-John F.
Harris of the brokerage house of Harris,
Gates & Co., which marketed part of the
shipbuilding stock, but Schwab declined
to see Dresser.
W. D. Guthrie, counsel for Schwab,
brought the facts of the Incident "out
through a series of questions directed to
Dresser. His aim was to show that Dres
ser had sought to plead with Schwab and
had threatened to make certain disclos
ures when recalled to the stand that
would reflect upon Schwab or to threaten
him, for he had no additional informa
tion, to divulge, but had sought to. ap
proach him in the hope that something
might be done- to save the shipbuilding
company. '
SCHWAB WITHHOLDS PROFITS.
Dresser asserted that the shipbuilding
company had been because
Schwab had withheld- the profits of the
Bethlehem company. >.This declaration he
twice spiritedly repeated when, at the end
ef the cross-examination by Guthrie, he
was given an opportunity to explain. . .
There was produced and offered as evi
dence a memorandum said to have been
prepared â¢ by; Colonel McCook and given
by him to Dresser. It contained the fig
ures upon which the . Trust Company of
the Republic undertook ' the . underwriting
of the shipbuilding company, and while
its purpose: was not explained, It is ex
pected that it will 1 cut an important' fig
ure at a later staga of the proceedings.
It. Is said that besides the division . of
stock detailed last , week by. Dresser
there was an additional division of money.
The memorandum shows an allowance for
"expenses" of 5200,000 , cash, ; $300,000 - in
bonds,' $500,000 in preferred . stock and
$500,000 In common stock. ,--Â¦-.'

he had written her many letters leading
her to 'believe that he had marriage In
tentions. 'Â¦* She said she "was taking eighty

might be of some use. I advised her
strongly against the trip to New. York
and against making any trouble for Sen

was only a few hours before her depart
ure and when she left me she was ap
parently considering my advice. The next
thing I heard was that she was in New

Miss Wood Is said to have shown very
strong feeling when first informed of Sen

way. Her associates in the Postofflce De
partment say that the only reference to
It there was this remark, which she made
to a fellow employe Just after her return
from England:
"Well, it seems I stayed away too
long." '
"There was nothing In Miss Wood's
statement to me just before she departed
for New Tork to lead to the belief that
she Intended to sue Senator Platt for
breach of promise. No question of money
was raised. Her sole object soems to be
to take some revenge on Mrs. Janeway,
whom she considered her -rival, and to
prevent the marriage if possible. I asked
her point blank if she intended a suit for
breach of promise and she said: 'No.*

any, accompanied her. She Intimated in

regarded "aa her legal adviser. To only

The Senator was told that $15,000, not
$25,000,. was the figure at which the affair
was settled.

LONDON, Oct. 15.â Japan has asked
Russia for, an assurance that the latter
power will not seek to include Korea
within the sphere of her influence. This
demand has not been presented as an ulti
matum, but Japan has explained that re
cent events, particularly in the neighbor
hood of the Yaju River, have caused the
Mikado's Government, great uneasiness,
which can be removed only by Russia
giving: the assurance indicated. This, ac
cording to what the Mornhig Post be
lieves to be excellent authority, is the
keynote of the Far Eastern situation.
The Japanese demand for guarantees
respecting Korea has been the subject
of extended negotiations, which are still
in progress. Russia sought to connect
the Korean with the Manchurian ques
tion and at one stage of the negotiations
offered to give Japan a satisfactory guar
antee as to Korea if Japan would under
take not to support any demand for the
evacuation of Manchuria. The Japanese
Government declined to give any such as
surance, as, - in the view of Japan, the
Korean and Manchurian questions are
separate and distinct.
As to whether the diplomatic situation
Is likely to develop in such manner as to
lead to war, the Morning Post says:
"No definite reply can be made to that
question, but the inference is drawn that,
as Russia was prepared on certain condi
tions to give the undertaking, required
by Japan, she does not regard the acqui
sition of Korea as a vital part of her
policy in the Far East.' Japan's view is
that while Korea is vital to her Inter
ests Manchuria is not. Great Britain and
the United States being equally concerned
with her in regard to the evacuation of
the Chinese province."
A dispatch from Kobe to the Dally Mall,
dated October 14, says:
- "Baron von Rosen, the Russian Min
ister, and Baron Komura, the Japanese
Foreign Minister, conferred again to-day.
It Is reported that a council of elder
statesmen (veterans outside the Cabinet),
General Kodama, late Interior Minister,
who has been appointed chief assistant to
the military staff, being present, adopted
resolutions yesterday to the effect that
Japan cannot tolerate any Russian move
endangering the Independences of Korea."

There is no community property or chil

absolute divorce without alimony was
asked. Mrs. Chapman has considerable
property, which Is being held in trust for
her and which was inherited from hef
father's estate. She is now with her
mother, Mrs. Wilhelmlna Murphy, in San
Francisco. \ . Â»-
When Mr. and Mrs. Chapman married
they had just reached their majority.
Even some of their closest friends have
not been aware of any trouble between
the couple, although there has been a
rumor on the streets for some little time
that Chapman was spending most of his
time away from home.
Every effort has been made by friends
of the couple to keep the divorce quiet;
Although It was filed September 5, no rec
ord was made of It in the County Clerk's
office and the clerks were given instruc
tions not: to make any note of the suit.
The divorce was granted October 6 and it
was only on the granting, of the Inter-'
locutory decree to-day that the matter
became public.
Mrs. Chapman waa formerly Miss Mur

T. Murphy and a niece of the Hon. B. D.
Murphy. Tears ago when her' mother
separated from her father she went with
her mother. Murphy objected strongly
to the marriage of his daughter and

USE OF MAILS
John J. Ryan, the turfmani gave in de
tail a conversatonr between Johns and
himself in a room at Terre Haute, during
which, the witness claimed, he made a
contract with Johns for $4500 for a fa
vorable ruling from Miller concerning the
use of the mails for his turf, information
bureau business. Ryan testified that all
his future transactions were with Johns
as the ' middleman up to last December,
when Johns came to Cincinnati and they
met In a room at the â¢ Gibson House,
where Ryan gave Johns $1100 in cash and
$3000 in two checks. Ryan told of subse
quent transactions in which, he says,
Johns wanted more funds, until the wit
ness finally made a statement of the
whole matter to the postofflce , inspectors
and made no further efforts to 1 get bets
on the races through- the mails.
Watson proceeded to read to the court
from those* original notes. The first
question propounded â¢ to ' Miller waa by
General Robb, when ho said:
Mr. Cochran and I have an unpleasant duty
and It must be performed now. Before any
thing in done you had better talk the matter
over. You arc a lawyer and it Is unnecessary
to tell you that subterfuge will be useless and
that we will have none of it. We will leave
that aside. The examiners have been at work
In the West on the Ryan matter/ We have
their reports, and their statements have been
corroborated. It looks mighty bad for you and
we want you to explain. â¢
When Robb and Cochran showed Miller
the reports and copies of letters and tele
grams ' indicating . that he had sent the
ruling of the v department to Attorney
Johns on December 10 and wired him that
the same had been sent, Miller admitted
that he had written a letter to Johns;
that he ,had not taken copies of his let
ters and telegrams to Johns or filed those
that he had received from him and that
he considered them as personal and not
official.

Dresser was succeeded on the stand by
George P. Dalley, assistant treasurer of
the Corporation Trust Company of New
Jersey and one of the resident directors
in New Jersey of the shipbuilding com
bination. He testified that his company
made a practice of furnishing resident
directors for corporations organized in
New Jersey, and that he and two of his
fellow clerks, Newman and Seward, had
been made directors of the shipbuilding
company. He did not know who had
asked him to act as a director, but un
derstood that the arrangement was^made
by Alexander and Green with the New
York branch of his company. He said
a single share of stock had been bought
for him in order that he might qualify,
but he did not know who had paid for it
or how it had been paid for.
After much fencing be said he did not
have a personal bank account at the time
he acquired the qualifying share. He re
membered attending at least two meet
ings, but kept referring Untermeyer to
the minutes for Information as to what
had been ddne at the meetings. He had
not visited any of the plants and had not
Dresser said that when he undertook the
shipbuilding project for the Trust Com
pany of the Republic he believed that
56,000,000 had been underwritten.
In the course of his testimony Dresser
mentioned the names of Herbert L. Sat
terlee, C. M- Wetmore. George R. Sheldon
end several other members of the reor
ganization. Satterlee Is a 8on-In-law of
J. P. Morgan. Dresser's use of these
names caused Guthrie to protest that all
â¢uch testimony was irrelevant.
Dresser announced that he protected
against the terms of the taking over of
the shipbuilding Interests of the Trust
Company of. the Republic by the Sheldon
syndicate because he believed the terms
to be unfair. Dresser said that he saw
the name of J. P. Morgan in the list of
members of the Sheldon syndicate, but
did not know if Schwab was a member.
The witness made no independent investi
ga/tlon of the shipbuilding plants, but ac
cepted the reports of others. He testified
that the prospectus had been approved by
the Mercantile Trust Company. He eaid
that he had several talks with Mr. Pam
during the month of December, 1902, about
the earnings of the company. Pam
showed him reports which Indicated that
the net earnings of the shipbuilding cor
poration for the first three months were
about $1,100,000, about half of which came
from the Bethlehem property. . The wit
ness said that when he told Pam that he
(Dresser) must make an assignment Pam
told him he must resign at once from the
shipbuilding board. Pam, he said, seemed
to be running the whole company.
The witness said that he did not know
that when the constituent companies' of
the shipbuilding combination had been
taken over all of them were heavily laden
with debt, but had been told so later on;
He did not know that they were in debt
when the prospectus was Issued. The un
derwriters took up the bonds for which
they had subscribed, paying 90 for them
and getting bonus in stock. There had
been no other assessment. The bonds had
been offered to the public at 97.
TRIO OF DUMMY DIBECTOHS.
When the Bethlehem property was
bought he knew that it was subject to
two mortgages of about $8,500,000. Schwab,
according to the witness, said that the
Bethlehem plant had earned $1,400,000
which had not been taken from the busi
ness.

him that if Mr. Schwab would take his grip
off Betnlehem the shipbuilding company would
be all right. I went to the office of Harris,
Gate* tc Co. In the Interest of the Ehipbuilding
company. Mr. Schwab had taken tiiis means
of putting it before the public, to thow that I
was there to Plead with him. I t.al<3 that if
he would give us any decent plan of reor
ganization and not the confiscation plan that
had been proposed the company would be all
right. I went over this shipbuilding matter
with Charley Harris six weeks ago. I told
him then that the wrecking or the shipbuilding
company was du* to Mr. Schwab withholding
the profit* of Bethlehem instead of letting
them flow Into the shipbuilding company, where
they belonged. I asked Mr. Harris to telephone
to Mr. Schwab and he did so. It out of the
mess and mire the United States Shipbuilding
Company caji be re-established that is what
I want to see done. I fcave no financial in
teTest, but I feel that it will help me.
Did you say anything to Mr. Schwab about
his liability in this matter?
No, 1 did r-.ot That is a legal question and
I know notfcinr about it.
HOST DESCENDS
UPON NEW YORK
Harris asked to be excused from giving
Schwab's reason for declining to see
Dresser. He added:
Mr. Dresser made It perfectly plain to me
that the idea of seeing Mr. Schwab and talk
ing thlmrs over was all his own and that he
hail taken the step without consulting: any
body.
NEW TORK, Oct. 14.-John F. Harris
of Harris, Gates & Co. made the follow
ing statement late this afternoon with
reference to Dresser's visit to him yes
terday:
Mr. Dresser wished it distinctly understood
that he did not want to plead with Mr. Schwab.
He said he believe 1 that an amicable discus
sion of the question might Induce Mr. Schwab
to "release his grip"' and that the United
States Shipbuilding Company could then be
rehabilitated. I repeated Mr. Dresner's state
ment to Mr. Schwab, who said he must de
cline to meet Mr. I>r*#ser.
JOHN F. HARRIS EXPLAINS.
ordered an appraisement of property, and
while he admitted that he and his fellow
directors in New Jersey knew nothing of
the shipbuilding business except such in
formation as reached them in the docu
ments laid before him, he would not ad
mit that he was merely a dummy di
rector. He finally said, however, that he
and the others acted on the direction of
the attorneys for the company. He knew
of the Union Iron Works through the
press, but did not know where the Bath
Iron Works were located.

"The playground of Masonry," as the
meeting place of Islam Temple of the
Ancient Arabic Order of the Mystic
Shrine Is called, was filled with activity
last night. The ceremonial session held in
Golden Gate Asylum, on Sutter street,
was attended by more than 600 red-fezzed
nobles of the shrine, who assembled to
witness the very Interesting, striking and
impressive degree conferred on 115 eli
gibles, who were anxious to have the
privilege of wearing the crescent and
scimetar as a lapel button. It was th3
largest class that has ever received the
degree In Islam Temple. Previous to the
work by which is explained the mysteries
of the order, there were . received 197 ap
plications for membership, and these
were all elected. Each of these, as well
as those who were Initiated, paid a fee
of $50 each, making a total collected in
initiation fees from the initiated and ap
plicantsâan aggregate of 304â of $15,200.
The reason for this Influx into the ranks
of the Shriners is the fact that from to
day on the fee will be $100.
The ceremonies were superintended by
Potentate Colonel C. H. Murphy and were
under the management of E. J. Benedict,
assisted by , Nobles E- B. Hlndes, John
Hammersmith, James A. Snook, William
V. Bryan, James A. Gleaves and C. E.
Landls. Each of the searchers after
Arabic truths received his money's worth,
and twenty- five specially selected received
a little more, much to the satisfaction of
the others, who were merely onlookers
and permitted to enjoy the fun-
After the' session had been declared
closed there was an adjournment to the
banquet halls, 650 being accommodated In
the lower one and 150 in the upper. An
excellent menu was disposed of, after
.which Potentate Murphy, acting as toast
master, called on a number of the nobles
to respond to toasts. The first he called
on was Noble Henry J. Crocker, the Re
publican candidate for Mayor, who, as
soon as his name was announced, was ap
plauded for nearly five 7 minutes, and when
introduced as the next Mayor of San
Francisco the "applause was redoubled and
the orchestra played "Hall to the Chief '
and "He's Â¦ a Jolly Good Fellow." Mr.
Crocker said he had come to the shrine
meeting to have fun and not to make a
political speech. "If you want to hear
politics," he said, "attend meetings on
the outside." , i "
R. R. Colgate, the millionaire paint man
of New" York, is no longer connected with
the North Shore road In an official ca
pacity. At a meeting of the directors of
the company held last Friday at the
main 'Offices on Market street President
John Martin submitted a letter from Col
gate, in. which the latter resigned from
the directorate and as vice president of
the corporation- ; The board then elected
K. M. Uotafing to the vacancy and desig
nated the new official to act for President,
Martin during his absence in New .York,
for, which city Martin will start in a few
days. â¢ . . ' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦'. . -.
Mr. Colgate's resignation is attributed to
the fact that he is a resident of the Bast
and cannot devote the attention necessary
to the duties of vice president. He was
one of the important factors in the finan
ciering of the road after its. purchase
from the Stetson company, and for a time
he exhibited a great personal interest In
the, Welfare of the company. It Is.under
stood; however, that he retains his stock
in the North Shore and will be represent
ed here by President Martin.
The directors at the same meeting levied
an assessment of $5 upon the capital stock
of the company. A similar assessment was
levied two months ago, which makes in
all $300,000, this amount being required to
meet the expenses j attending the trans
formation of the lines between Sausallto
and San Rafael and Mill Valley from
etcam to electric power and for Improve
ments at the southern terminus. At the
time Â¦ the work was voted on the.stock
holders. agreed to pay^, an assessment of
$10, but this was finally divided into two
assessments.
' 'Manager Rank of the North Shore road
announced yesterday that the company
will be operating electric trains between
Sausalito and San Rafael and Mill Valley
under a new schedule on Saturday. There
will 'be sixteen trains running both ways,
including new evening trains to Mill Val
ley and to San Rafael, leaving this side at
10:20 p. m. For the convenience of busi
ness men there will be four trains each
morning from " San Rafael and Mill Val
ley,; those from: San Rafael leaving: there
at 5:25, 6:35, 7:40 and 8:35. The time sched
ule for; the departure , of the morning

"I'll teach you to show a man where the
money Is," he often repeated between his
curses. Then he ransacked the house and
took the little money he found.
After securing the money the robber
commlttted his final indignities, by chlo
roforming and mauling his victim.
Mrs. Basch was conscious but could do
nothing when the wretch produced the
bottle containing the chloroform and held
it to her nose until she sank into a stupor.
' Her assailant had a long, scraggy mus
tache, reddish colored hair and there was
a very . noticeable . black skin blotch on
his upper lip where his mustache parted.
Mrs. Basch believes him to be about five
feet" eight Inches tall, very broad shoul
dered and robust, with big strong hands.
He wore a black stiff hat and on one fin
ger wore a cheap sliver horseshoe ring.
The man who stood guard was of dark
complexion, with smooth face, but the
woman took no notice of him, as his com
panion did all the talking.

bound, gagged, kicked, chloroformed: and
then robbed by a desperado was the treat
ment suffered this afternoon bjr Mrs, Max
Basch, a handsome young Jewess, living
on the outskirts of the city. The crime
was committed at 2 o'clock, but was not
discovered until this evening, when her
husband returned home and found her
lying wounded and unconscious. For five
hours she lay senseless from the effects
of chloroform. Her faco .was pressed
down on a heap of' matting, her hands
bound behind her back with a handker
chief drawn so taut that it almost stopped
the circulation and her mouth was stuffed
with wads of paper. The unfortunate
woman waa bruised and blackened by
kicks on the breast and side as she lay
helpless. She was on the point of suf
focating when found and could not have
lived another half hour. She lias rallied,
however, and will recover.
The criminal who operated while an ac
complice stood guard r,, evidently sought
money only, as $8 was taken, while dla<
monds worth $300 were not touched. The
robber and his companion called at the
house, 734 Vernon avenue* ostensibly to
buy apples advertised for sale. After
bargaining on the front porch, he sudden
ly shoved the startled~woman into the
hall, entered himself, shut the door and
locked it. Then ha demanded money.
Mrs. Baach pleaded that ahe had little
money, but offered her jewels, extending
her hands with rings set with diamonds.
With an. oath the desperado threw her
back. She told him she had but $8 and
that it was in a dresser drawer. Cursing
her as a liar the thug poised himself and
swung a terrific blow to the side of Mrs.
Basch's head, knocking her down. She
screamed and he kicked her again and
again. Then he leaped upon her pros
trate form, placed his knees upon her
chest and silenced her cries by forcing
wads of newspaper .into her throat.

Russell worked hard during the- day
while in the Southern city, and spent his
nights stealing. He thus got considerable
cash and property. He was often arrest
ed, and though Â¦ proof of thefts seemed
clear, escaped by having Jury trials.
Finally he , was \ caught thieving and his
case : was v set for trial before ; Justice
Austin. Pending, this trial an attempt
was made one night to assassinate Aus

Captain Â¦ of Detectives Martin received
word from the Los Angeles police last
night that Hilliard Russell, who killed
his wife in this city on Tuesday morning,
is the most notorious . negro thief who
ever operated in Los Angeles. It is said
he served a term In an Eastern peniten
tiary for manslaughter . before coming
West, and while living in Los Angeles
his first wife died under suspicious cir
cumstances. It is believed she expired
from the effects of a beating by Russell,
but as this could not be proved he was
never arrested. .

with the gulls and the sand pipers had

made military, agent of ' the State when
the war of. the rebellion flamed out. In
that capacity he was on, the battlefields

midst of the fearful carnage. Later, when
the war was over, he I was , appointed re
ceiver of Government funds for tho Ter
ritory of ; Arizona and held that position
for. several years. ."-Â¦
Ten years ago Colonel Dailey received
from his boon companion, Adolph Sutro,
a little patch of sand out on the beach
below the Cliff House. There he gathered
together enough of the flotsam of the set
â broken bones ~, of dead ships â to build
himself a tiny cabin. The rooftree, clap
boards and Joists all came out of the sea;
not a sliver of wood was there which had
not been once a part of some vessel, long
since lying broken backed at the bottom
of the green depths.
Here? housed in by the skeletons of
ships, old Colonel Dailey spent the fading
days of his life. For years his light was
the only one which winked through the
blur of the storms, his little garden- spot
wasthe only color in the yellow waste of
sands. Then one by ; one the old street
cars began to be wheeled out to the beach
and grouped. into a mongrel village about
"Colonel Dalley's camp." His tiny cab-
In and flower patch became the -nucleus
of Oceanside. >
Old Colonel Charles E. Dailey, the fath
er of what was once Carvllle, but le now
known by 1 the more dignified title of
Oceanside, is dead. Yesterday his body
was found lying in' the little bedroom of
his driftwood cabin out by the ocean
beach. Just as death had stricken it. With
only the boom Â« of the surf for his re
quiem, the- little old hermit with the
snowy beard had passed into the great
sea of mystery there was no one
to close the dimjjyes or fold the wrinkled
old hands across the breast.
The Japanese Consul here investigated
the matter and decided that the girl was
held there through a mistake on the part
of the society. He says he desires to send
the girl- back to her father, who Is said
to be a merchant in Shikoku, Japan, but
the Humane Society of Denver refuses to
allow her to leave. Consul Takagi states
that he will bring the matter to the at
tention of the authorities at

Rev. Mother Augustine was born in
Montreal In 1849 and entered the order of
the Sisters of the Holy Name when 14
years of age. She came to California In
the fall 'Â©f 1868 and entered the Convent
of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart as a
teacher. , She was directress of the board
ing-school for. fourteen years, and for two
years was local f superior of. the order oC
the Sisters of the Holy Name. A short
time ago she was elected provincial supe
rior of the order, and her term had not
expired at tne time, of her death. Mother
Augustine has been Identified with the
Convent of Our Lady for the past thirty
five years. v \
Mother Baptist came to the coast in 1861
with Mother Augustine, and it was during
that year that the Convent of Our Lady
of the Sacred Heart was erected. Mother
Baptist was the first superior of* the in
stitution; Â¦
A telegram has been received from
Mother Baptist, who for eighteen years
was connected with the convent, saying
that she would arrive In Oakland to-mor
row evening to attend the funeral of
Mother Augustine. .Mother Baptist was
mother superior of the convent when
Mother Augustine first came to the coast,
and for many, years they were coworkers
at the institution.
The body, will be taken to Oakland at 9
o'clock this morning and directly to the
convent, where it will lie in state until the
funeral, which will take place Saturday
morning at 9 o'clock.
When the body arrives at the convent
it will be received. by the sisters and pu
pils, who will be dressed in deep mourn
ing. v \
â¢ Rev. Mother Augustine, provincial su
perior of the order of the Sisters of the
Holy Kame and directress of the Con
vent of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart,
died at St.: Mary's Hospital at 3 o'clock
yesterday afternoon after a short illness.
Her death was the result of an operation
performed last Monday.
During the years that she had been at
the head of the convent Mother Augus-
' tine had made a multitude of friends and
since she was ill many of her former pu
pils called to see her. Although* she knew
that death was not far off the mother
superior, greeted them with the same ten
derness and love that they knew when
they were under her care at the convent.
A number of the graduates of the
school whom the mother superior had not
seen for more than twenty years called
at the- hospital yesterday to see their for
mer teacher and for each one she had
some word of love. During the afternoon
she grew rapidly weaker, although she
was conscious to the last and recognized
the sisters of the convent who were gath
ered at her bedside. As the end ap
proached she asked if there was no way
that she could be taken to the convent,
that she might die among the Sisters of
the order..
The Northern Commercial Company has
not succeeded in getting a supply of oil to
its reservoirs on the Upper Yukon. Its
steamer Sarah was compelled to substi
tute wood for the oil burners. The wood
supply has been found Insufficient and her
crew has to get off and chop fuel as she
goes up the river.
The White Pass Railway has notified
shippers that it cannot transport all of
the freight now on hand at White Horse
and offers to release any portion of It
that can get transportation to Dawson
on barges or independent steamers. Sev
eral shippers have chartered the Tyrrell
and Light, which are making two round
trips to White Horse, and other shippers
are offering them four and five times the
regular freight rates to get their ship
ments through.
TACOMA, Oct. 14.â Transportation com
panies and shippers are making the ef
fort of their lives to land at Dawson
thousands of tons of freight which" now
stands in danger of indefinite delay by
the freezing of the Yukon River. The wa
ter Is lowering dally and a fre'ezeup Is
expected within ten days. Steamers be
tween White Horse and Dawson had to
Jettison part of their .cargoes to- enable
them to get down the river. Ten days
ago the steamer Mary Graff threw over
board 150 head of cattle in order that an
other steamer might be able to haul her
off a newly, discovered sandbar. The cat
tle swam in the wrong, direction and the
members of the crew became cowboys In
boats In an effort to make them swim to
ward the nearest shore.

him. The complaint Is sworn to by J.
M. Holloway, a well known oil man, who
charges Cunningham with the alleged
theft of SSO feet of oil well casing.
A large quantity of oil well drilling' ma
chinery was stolen at Kern River last
year and traced to the property of a com
pany at Sunset, of which Cunningham
was the general manager, and there found
and recovered. Charles S. Vezle, an em
ploye of the company, was arrested for
the alleged theft and at his trial a' few
weeks ago he offered the defense that he
was acting under the orders of Cunning
ham and supposed that his employer had
a right to the machinery. The trial re
sulted In a disagreement by the Jury.
Cunningham was one of the "principal
witnesses for the State at this trial.
Before coming to California Cunning
ham was Sheriff of Santa Fe, N. M.,
where he gained a wide reputation in con
nection with the famous Borrego murder
trial, a case which went to the Supreme
Court of the United States. It was after
ward taken before Presidents Cleveland
and McKJnley. -^
POMONA. Oct. 14.â Josiah Grerg, one of
tte oldest settlers in Southern California,
died at his home in Pomona to-day, aged
ti years. He was a first cousin of Jeffer
son Davis, President of the Confederacy,
and kept In close touch with his famous
cousin for years. He was sent to Europe
twice on errands for the Government
when Davis was Secretary of War. He
was the United States agent who went
to Arabia and brought camels for use on
the deserts of New Mexico and Arizona
by the army in 1S53 and 1S54.
When the Civil War broke out In 1S61
Gregg was worth more than $400,000 in
cotton and sugar lands in Mississippi. He
bought Confederate Government bonds by
the thousand and gave away $100,000 to
clothe and feed the Confederate soldiers.
"When tb-i war was over he was left pen
niless. He once sent a Christmas gift of
SlO.OvO to Jefferson Da\-is during the dark
est days cf the Civil War.
Gregg settled In Pomona when there
â¢were but sixty residents here. By reason
of fortunate real estate investments and
the rapid appreciation in land values In
Pomona Valley he accumulated a large
fortune in his old age. He has relatives
all over California and Nevada. j

boys went down together, but Lewis
came to , the surface in a moment and
swam, to the barge. Little Walter failed
to come up and his horror stricken com
panions swam to the dock and gave the
alarm. Walter, McKay, a cousin of the
deceased, was notified and J made several
ineffectual attempts to locate the body.
In the meantime Mrs. McKay had been
notified and in company with her daugh
ter. Miss Mary -McKay, hastened to the
scene, of the accident. The heartbroken
mother and her daughter with tear
dimmed eyes watched the search for the
body of their loved one until 7 o'clock
last night, when Walter McKay, with the
aid of a pole, located the body and diving
into the water brought it to the surface:
The Coroner's office was notified, but
upon the direction of Dr. Leland the body
was not removed to the Morgue. Mrs.
McKay Is prostrated with grief and has
the sympathy of the entire district in her
sad bereavement.
All ' of i the boys except young McKay
were able to swim and they lost no time
In Jumping off the dock._JWlth boyish
glee they disported themselves in the wa
ter. Near the dock a barge that has lost
its usefulness lies firmly Imbedded in the
mud. This offered an ideal place from
which to dive and the lads clambered up
on the old hulk. All of them dove into
the water with the exception of the un
fortunate boy. He waited. a moment and
then jumped off, landing on Lewis' back.
A distressing tragedy, which. evoked an
outburst of . sympathy throughout the
Potrero district, occurred yesterday af
ternoon at 3 r o'clock," when "Walter Mc-
Kay, a 15-year-old schoolboy, met hi*
death in the bay at the dock of the Arc
tic Oil Works!
The dead boy, who was the son of Mrs.
Charles C. McKay of .616 . Eighteenth
street, in company with three other lads â
E. Lewis ; of 1188 .Kentucky street, Harry
Timby of 705 Tennessee street and T.
Bailey of 1060 Kentucky streetâ decided to
go swimming In the bay and accordingly
repaired to the Arctic Oil Works, where
they divested themselves of their wearing
apparel preparatory to plunging into .the
water. "
RUSSELL'S PAST
FULL OF EVIL
While in London I visited the commission
ers who were fixing the boundary dispute be
tween Canada and the Unltii States. All of
the documentary evidence shows that the pres
ent existing lines are the same as those held
by Russia prior to the purchase of Alaska by
us. I do not believe, were It not for the dls- (
covery of -gold in the Klondike, that any dls- .
pute would have ever arisen.- Our only hope
is in Lord Alverstone. England's Chief Justice,
who is on the commission, and who, I believe,
is an able Jurist and an honorable man. With
out him the commissioners would merely come
to a tie vote. I think that he will look at It
from a purely legal standpoint and his decision
will be Just. â¢
Senator Perkins was accompanied on his
trip by his daughter Pansy, whom he left
visiting relatives In Maine when he re
turned to California. He will remain here
about two weeks and then depart for the
East to attend the next session of Con
gress on November 9.
Why In France, the famed place for the

fruit that the vineyards of Fresno In this

AMEBICA'S ADVANTAGES.
This year has been a hard one for the work

to the difficulty with which the raw products

The poorer classes have been visibly affected
and will vote seainst Chamberlain, who rep
resents the aristocracy, and defeat him; still
I think he is in the right. . .
Manchester and all of the large manufactur
ing cities in Ireland and Scotland are prac
tically dead, and many people are out of em
ployment. Belfast and Glasgow were the only
cities that presented any marked state of ac
tivity.
I think that the Judiciary system of .England
is superior to ours. The Judges are appointed
for life 'on their good behavior. Any one who
breaks the law Is fully punished. Here, where
the Jurists are constantly changing and the
matter of politics figures so keenly in their se
lection we are lees likely to have the laws as
rigidly' enforced as they ought to be.
Seeing the different governments of Europe.
I am more than ever deeply Impressed with
the privileges and advantages that our form of
government gives. Vhat we should fight
against is the formation of classes. It Is the
classes who are responsible for the contest aow
going on in England,
The Â¦ free trade and protection contest now

The better class of druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
vho devote their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known value, in accordance with physicians' prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjunctsof a first-class pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know . that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or-'
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction.
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the"
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have the name â u Syrup of Figs" â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Company â California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
oS on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness. '
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company-
California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the/,
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class ot I
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

Engineer that permission be granted for
a limited period of one' year to the Union

Attention Is called to the fact that the
â¢width of Illinois street, between Sixteenth

improvements of the Union Oil Company
occupy seventy feet of the easterly por
tion of this street. The company will be
required to remove its improvements from

John W. Barr Jr. and William F. Nor
ton, wealthy residents of Louisville, Ky.,
are guests at the Palace, their presence
in this city being in 1 the Interest of a large
estate, a portion of which Is located In
California. It was left by Captain W. F.
Norton, one of Louisville's most eccentric
bankers,, who died some months ago.'Cap
tain Norton inherited large property in
terests and several million dollars from
his father, who was a member of the
banking firm of G. W. Norton & .Co., and
a brother of Exsteln Norton, the well
known railroad magnate of New York.
During his lifetime the captain was a
heavy drinker, and finally when his health
failed he came to California with a phy
sician and a nurse. Eventually he located
in Coronado, where he built a $GO,000 cot
tage, and' there he died. In his will he
provided that his body should be cre
mated in Cincinnati, and he set aside a
certain amount of money to be used for
chartering a train to carry' his remains
and his friends to the scene of the crema
tion. His. will also provided that the cre
mation should be : attended .with merry
making instead of mourning, and that
there should be "light music and plenty
of refreshments, both liquid and solid."
Tho bulk of Norton's fortuneâ that is,
about $750,000â was bequeathed- to the
Louisville Baptist Orphans' Home, an in.
utitution' that had been fostered by the
deceased's father, and numerous legacies
were left to friends. The cottage'at Coro
nado was given to the wife of James L.
Frazer, former superintendent of the
coast , division of the Southern Pacific
Company.
Shortly after his death a number of the
collateral heirs gave notice of their inten
tion to contest the will on the ground that
Captain Norton was not of sound mind
when he executed it, and in support, of
tbeir contention they cited the eccentric
provisions in the instrument and recalled
the odd actions of the captain during the
latter part of his life, among them the
practice ' of wearing a policeman's uni
form on certain days when hi3 unfortu
nate acquaintance .were, invited to call
on him and recite their hard luck stories,
which usually were productive of financial
contributions from the captain.'
Barr and William F. Norton, who are
here, -are, wlth> a -Louisville trust com
pany, ; tho executors of the estate and
have been preparing to combat the con
tentions of the dissatisfied heirs, or if pos
sible to compromise.' Their visit to this

"NEW HAVEN, Conm, Oct. 14.â The
Holy Cross football eleven furnished a
sensation on Tale field to-day by playing
the most spectacular game of tho season
and scoring ten points against Tale's thir
ty-Fix. Tale had scored five touchdowns
and had forced Holy Cross to add a safety
to her credit in the first half. The second
half opened with a number of substitutes
on the Yale team. A cos.tly fumble by
Preston lost not only the ball, but ground.
Holy Cross failed to gain by rushing and
carried the ball toward the middle of the
thirty-yard Â¦ line, where Reed dropped
back to the thlrty-flve-yard line and, with
Larkin to catch and place the ball for
him, sent' it between the posts clean and
true. Tale renewed her rushing game and
bore Holy Cross down the field to a sixth
touchdown. Five minutes later Tale again
flmbled, and from almost the same loca
tion Reed again succeeded in placing a
goal. Even Tale students cheered the
play. During the remainder of the half
Holy Cross rushed the ball far better
than Tale, and once McCarthy nearly got
a clear field to the goal after bucking his
way through for twenty yards.

to behold. Brother Crowhurst, though

with fortitude and was surrounded by

followed the harsh cries of "Police" and
the ripping of the screen and the remov

Never before within "the recollection of
Good Templars had such a scene been en
acted or witnessed by members of the

At 7 o'clock, one hour after the day**
meeting had adjourned, one of the mem
bers, Andrew L. Johnston, entered tha
room and demanded of Brother Craw
hurst that he remove his spotless white
sheet which served for the screen, take.
down the posts and carry away his ex
pensive lantern, which was to aid in the
exhibition of rare Good Templar pictures.
Crowhurst, who had reorganized the old
Alameda County Lodge of the Independ

believed rather upset thd equilibrium of
some members of District No. 5,, Ledge
of San Francisco, of Which Johnston ia a
member, flatly denied Johnston's right to
interfere with his screen, his pictures or
his lantern, and demanded the privilege
given him by the sub-committee to treat
the juvenile element of the Good Tem
plar order to Illustrations so intimately
related to the "organization's labors.
Johnston, It Is said, would hear no ex
planation, but simply tore down the
screen, and there was confu3ion. demands
and ejaculations. The "janitor of 102

' GUAYMAS, Mexico, Oct. 14.â Jesus Car
rara, an officer of the Twentieth Mexican
Battalion, lies dead as the result of a
duel fought with Alberto Mungia, a Guay
mas â¢merchant. The affair took 'place
Tuesday afternoon on the outskirts of
Gaaymas.'; "'Â¦ The men met by\ appointment
at at spot surrounded by trees: "and un
occupied* adobe houses at the corner of
Twelfth avenue and Nineteenth street, i
They had , previously, ozT the 'Â¦ same day,
engaged in a fight at a drinking place In
the. center of the city, when Mungia had
attempted to stab his victim. He failed
In this, as bystanders separated the men,
â¢but- Mungia immediately challenged Car
rara 1 : to a duel with swords. The latter
accepted the challenge, and the men, and
their seconds were ready at the appointed
hour on the spot selected. Mungia thrust
his sword through Carrara's breast at
the first fierce onslaught, killing his op

Notary Public A. K. Daggett, who was
accused by Edward Murphy of aiding and
abetting Attorney W. T. Kearns in his
efforts to defraud the late Jane Canney,
his aunt, keenly feels Murphy's charges,
which were made In a suit filed by Mur
phy In the Superior Court Tuesday. He
says that they are unjust to him and Im
plicated him without any reason or cause.
In explaining his connection with the
case yesterday Mr. Daggett said:
I never wu a party to any scheme such as
Murphy alleges. It Is true that Mrs. Canney
Mgned a power of attorney, or. rather, maje
hÂ«r mark, before me In my capacity as a no
taÂ¥y, but I knew of no reason why she should
not. as I understood that Kearns waÂ« manajr
ing her affairs. When I affixed my seal to the
paper, I axked her If she knew what It was
she was pignlnc and If *he was acquainted with
the purport of the document, and she told me
that she wa*. It Is true she was sick but the
making of a power of attorney under such cir
cumstances ia a very common thing. Hun
dreds are made under Just such circumstances
There was nothing; done to lead me to think
that the old lady was being robbed and the
first I knew that such an allegation had been
made was when I read The Call thjs morning
Notary Public A. K. Daggett Avers
He Did Not Scheme to Defraud
Jane Canney.
SAYS HE IS WBONGFUIXY
ACCUSED IN MURPHY'S SUIT
FOR the first time since the be
ginning of the long drawn out
controversy relative to the mak
ing of huare forest reserves in
California Gifford Plnchot, chief
forester of the Bureau of Forestry of the
United States Department of Agriculture,
has taken occasion to answer all objec
tions to the policy of the National Gov
ernment. Millions of acres have been
added to the forest reserves in Northern
California within a few months and all
timber bearing counties in the State, to
gether with the agricultural ones, have
taken a lively interest In the proceedings.
The object of the. Government in making
forest reserves is always and everywhere, as
President Roosevelt has said, "the making and
maintenance of prosperous homes." In other
words, forest reserves are made for the â¢ use
Forester Pinchot's exposition of the pol
icy of tbe Government" was drawn out
by a letter addressed to him by T. C.
Friedlander. secretary of the California
Water and Forest Association. The ob
jections that have come to the knowledge
of the forester are discussed separately,
the objection being first stated and
the discussion following. Preliminary to
the discussion Forester Plnchot sets forth
the general policy of the Government in
the making of forest reservations as fol
lows:
In his complaint he alleges that his wife
has never let slip an opportunity to In
sult and humiliate him. He says that she
has neglected his interests to such an ex
tent that his home life has been devoid of
any semblance of happiness. Frequently,
he says, he has had to leave the house to
avoid the effects of her wrath. She would
not prtpare his meals, he complains,
neither would she attend to his wants as
should a true and loving wife. His ef
forts to reform her were met with scorn
and derison. he alleges, and she would
add insult to injury by calling 4iim a
"bow-legged runt" and many other names
calculated to cause him the keenest
mental agony.
Emma A. Evans, who was married to
Samuel Evans at Wichita, Kans., Just
five years ago, claims that her matri
monial venture has also proven a fail
ure. In her suit for divorce she avers
that it is because of her husband's treat
ment of her that she is unhappy. She
asks for a decree on the ground of
cruelty, alleging that last July, while they
were living on Clay street, he struck,
choked and cursed her.
Katherine M. Howard wants a divorce
from Benjamin F. Howard for neglect
and Fred Hansen Is seeking a divorce
from Louisa Hansen for desertion. Suits
were also tiled by Lillian B. Smith
against Charles E. Smith for desertion,
Adele C. Sullivan against Florence M.
Sullivan for cruelty, John A. Byrne
against Minerva Byrne for desertion, C.
H. Rogers against Lizzie E. Rogers for
Intemperance, Timothy Danahar against
Bridget Danahar for Intemperance, and
Nora Iverson against Ola Carist Iverson
for desertion.
Mamie Davidson wants her former hus
band, Alonzo Davidson Jr., punished for
contempt of court for failing to pay her
$30 a month alimony, as he was ordered to
do when she secured a divorce from him
last August. She says that he is amply
able to do so, but spends his earnings for
luxuries and in personal adornment, leav
ing her to earn a living for herself and
chiW by working in a cloak house. She
says she Is now too 111 to work and is
forced through his neglect to depend upon
charity.
Judge Troutt annulled the marriage of
Florence G. Devens to Thomas G. Devens.
Interlocutory decrees of divorce on the
ground of desertion were granted to Mary
L. Walton from Richard H. Walton, F.
C. Wheeler from- Frances Maud Wheeler,
and Catherine Murasky from Charles G.
Murasky. :"-' : '
Leila E. Biedenbach recently secured a
divorce in San Luis Obispo from Fred
Biedenbach." The charge was cruelty.
The plaintiff was allowed to resume her
name. Smith, and was given the custody
of their one child, Irving F. Biedenbach.
William R- Hamilton Is a very unhappy
individual. He dates his unhapplness
from tbe day of his marriage to Maude
Hamilton at Los Angeies five years ago.
In a complaint for divorce filed by him
yesterday he says that ever since she
became his wife he has lived a life of
misery and all because of his diminutive
size.
W. R. Hamilton Says
They Are Too Bitter
to Suit Him.

"Woodmen and Cyders.
Objection â That the. forest Is unnecessary
to regulate the flow of streams, but. on the
contrary, wastes the water by absorblnz It.
Answer- â 1Â». has been proved by the experience
of all mankind, not only in the United States
but throughout the world, that the forests
do regulate the streams. This truth Is. held
most nrmly by the reclamation service of the
United States Geological Survey, which is the
best authority on the subject In the United
States. Those who hold that the forest does
net resulate the flow of streams or that the
trees absorb more water than they save, are
simply mistaken. Careful local studies by the
agents of the bureau of forestry â¢ in Northern
California definitely confirm this view.
Objection â That, through insufficient appro
priations or otherwise, the forest reserve ser
vice is likely to be inefficient, so that the
people will suffer. Answer â It is true that
there have been many faults in the forest re
serve service hitherto. Many of thofe faults
have already been corrected. When the care
of the reserves is transferred to the bureau
of forestry they will be managed with a full
knowledge of local conditions and their value
to the people will steadily Improve. Congress
recognizes their usefulness more and more and*
it becomes^ easier year by year to get appro
priations for forest work.
The distinction between forest reserves and
national parks should be kept clearly in mind.
A notional Dark is. a sort of outdoor museum
of beautiful things. A forest reserve is a
factory where wood, water and graes are pro
duced for the men who need them. Â¦
Finally, the forest reserves will check and
in the end prevent, forest fires. In other
words the timber upon them will be used,
not destroyed, and it will be succeeded by more
timber to be used In the same way. They will
promote, not check, the immediate permanent
development of the country, but they are op
posed to the flash in the pan policy which
would sacrifice ' the real good . of any region
to a temporary boom with its disastrous con
sequences. They favor and assist the home
maker and every solid Industry, but not the
speculator. Just so far as their ' object and
working are really understood thÂ«y> are favored
by the people of the "West, and I have no doubt'
whatever that the same will be true In North
ern California.
FLOW OF STREAMS.
Objection â That the prolific growth of young
trees after cutting makes forest protection un
necessaryâ Answer â It is true that natural
reproduction is prolific In Northern California,
but vast areas of forest land have been con
verted into chaparral by wasteful cutting fol
lowed by rcoeated flres. Forestry will keep
such lands producing: trees instead of brush.
There ts no auestion which Is the more de
sirable. Cutting under the principles of for
estry Is practicable. We know that this is true
because such cutting Is actually going on with
success under all sorts of conditions in differ
ent parts of the United States and over large
areas. â¢
INVESTMENTS CONSIDERED.
Objection â That investmen of capital in rail
roads and power plants would be discouraged.
Answer â The success of power plants neces
sarily depends on continuous water supply and
on the holding of the eoil by the forest to pre
vent the silting up of reservoirs. Power plants
are much more likely to locate on stream*
whose headwaters are protected by fores % re
serves than elsewhere. Provision for the right
of way for railroads through forest reserves Is
made by law. as well as for canals, ditches,
telegraph lines, etc. So much timber ia held
in private hands where the railroads are con
templated that the creation of forest reserves
would probably not retard their construction
even if no provision were made for the sale of
forest reserve timber. As it is, the Govern
ment understands perfectly that timber from
certain regions cannot be cut unless large
bodies are made available at one time, and
the law provides ample means â¢ for dealing
with this matter. Transportation facilities are
very desirable for the successful management
of forest reserves.
Objection â That livestock interests will be
injured by restriction?., the reduction of num
bers, etc. Answer â The DOlicy of the Govern
ment is to use the forage products of the re
serves, and they are being so used every
where. The Government is anxious to pre
vent the destruction of the stock industries by
overgrazing and the consequent loss to public
and private interests. Durins the present sea
son 1,151,278 sheep and 459.137 cattle and
horses were grazed on forest reserves under
regulations. Special attention Is being given
to the stock Industry In the examination of the
proposed reserves by the Bureau of Forestry,
whose policy is to guard the interests of small
owners and resident owners of stock with
peculiar care.
Objection â That the withdrawal of large
bodies of land from sale and settlement will
keep homeseekers away and that much of the
withdrawn land will grow fruit trees success
fully after the timber Is removed,. Answer â
The policy of the Government is distinctly
against the inclusion of agricultural lands In
forest reserves? In this connection I repeat
that the lines of the withdrawals were never
intended to be the lines of the permanent re
serves. If lands not now thought suitable for
agriculture are Droved to be so later on pro
vision Is made for opening such lands to set
tlement and no harm will have been done by
their temporary protection.
Objection â That mineral development will be
retarded by the reserves. Answer â The min
eral land laws apply equally within the re
serves and outside, except that large users of
timber are required to purchase it from the
Government under permit. Fear is expressed
that red tape will interfere with the prompt
issuance of permits and that development will
suffer. The rezulations meet the case fully
and this fear Is unfounded. The forest reserve
service is acting more and more promptly and
will continue to improve In that direction,
especially when the care of the reserves Is
transferred to the Bureau of Forestry., which
seems likely to happen during the coming win
ter. For example., in the Black Hills forest
reserve, the mining interests unite in support
of the reserve, because they have come to seo
clearly that successful mining depends on a
permanent timber supply. Further, the crea
tion of reserves prevents locations under the
timber and stone act but not under the mining
laws.
MINERAL DEVELOPMENT.
- Objection â That large owners of timber lands
will denude thetr lands and then exchange
them for valuable timber lands elsewhere, and
that here again the counties will lose the
taxes. Answer â Taxes on denuded lands un
suited for agriculture are necessarily- very
small. Denuded lands are often very suitable
for forest reserve purposes, for the reason
given. Where denuded lands are necessarily
included within forest reserve boundaries, their
owners are at present given the right to ex
change for more valuable lands outside, which
Is to be regretted. The friends of forest re
serves have repeatedly attempted to limit the
exchange to lands of equal value. Even if
they should fail, the opportunity to take up
valuable timber lands Is rapidly disappearing.
If the timber on thousands of square miles of
land now covered with chaparral had been cut
under proper regulations, those lands â¢ would
carry Instead valuable stands of timber and
would be permanent sources of wealth to the
counties in which they He. It would have
been Immensely to the advantage of every
timber county in Northern California if such
regulations could have been applied from the
beginning.
Objection â That large areas of land unsuited
for forest reserves now owned by the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company have ' been included
in the withdrawals, that the creation of the
reserves will permit the company to exchange
these comparatively worthless lands for valu
able lands elsewhere, and that the surrender
of such lands to the Government will injure
the county revenue by the amount of the taxes
paid upon them. Answer â Lands not suitable
for forest reserve purposes will not be in
cluded in reserves. But since forest reserves
are for permanent use, lands temporarily de
nuded of their timber may be very valuable
for forest reserve purposes. Brush and chap
arral are of great importance as protectors
of water supply- The benefit to any county
from the full conservative use of its resources
through the forest reserves will far more than
make up for any loss in taxes As shown In
its dealings with the Santa Fe Railroad Com
pany in Arizona, it is the policy of the Gov
ernment to exchange for lands of equal value
where railroad lands are unavoidably included
in forest reserves.
Having stated these, general facts about the
reserves, let me take up the specific objections
to the reserves In Northern California, as I
have been able to gather them. Some of these
objections are based on the assumption that
the lines of the withdrawals are Intended to be
those of the permanent, reserves, if such are
created. The fact is that the withdrawals
were made simply to give time for a more
careful examination of the lands, and that
they were never Intended to represent the
boundaries of forest reserves. Otherwise the
five men from the Bureau of Forestry who are
now examining 1 these lands in Northern Cali
fornia would be wasting their time.
In view of the Importance to this State
that all phases of the forest reserve
question should have all the light pos
sible thrown upon it the views and state
ments of Forester Plnchot are given here
with in full:
THE RAILROAD LANDS.
â¢f thÂ« people and' for no other reason.
If It will not toe more useful to the people
of Northern California to make forest reserves
there than not to make them, then not a sin
gle reserve should be made in that region.
Provision is made In the law and in the reg
ulations for the use of every resource of every
forest reserve. Â¦ The idea that the making^" of
a forest reserve ties up any resource 1Â» wholly
and absolutely mistaken. It ia true that the
law now prevents the export of forest reserve
timber from the State In which It Is cut, but
repeated efforts have been made by the friends
of the forest reserve policy in Congress to
change that law, and they will doubtless suc
ceed In the near future. I want to repeat that
the forest reserves are â¢ for use and that all
their resources are available for development.
This Is true whether we consider the interests
of California as a whole or of Northern Cali
fornia alone, or whether we take the narrow
est local view. - . .

cultured, progressive society, a wealth of unending

ART IN SCHOOL GROUNDS.
ONE of the gratifying features of the municipal
campaign is the evidence notable almost
everywhere of a determination on the part of
the people to get rid of the class divisions that dis
turbed the community in the campaign of two years
ago and get back to straight politics. It has been
noted by careful observers of the drift of popular sen
timent that the contest is already virtually narrowed
down to an issue between Crocker and Schmitz, as
the voters feel that Lane represents merely a ma
chine â that he is a perfunctory candidate nominated
not in the hope of victory, but solely that the faction
back of him may control the Democratic organiza
tion in the campaign of next year.
It is fortunate for San Francisco that at this junc
ture in her affairs she has a citizen of the capacity and
public spirit of Henry J. Crocker to come forward
and undertake a canvass for the mayoralty. The city
needs the service of just such a man in that office.
The desire of the people to begin a new era of mu
nicipal development has been amply demonstrated by
the big vote in favor of issuing bonds for public im
provements. That vote meant progress and enter
prise. It meant a wish for an administration that
will work with efficiency and with economy, trans
forming the city into a new and greater San Fran
cisco, with a thoroughly metropolitan equipment of
streets, sewers, parks, schools and municipal insti
tutions of all kinds.
Had such an aspiration on the part of the people
been confronted by a municipal campaign in which
there was no candidate bigger than the representa
tive of a faction, none with a capacity for direct
ing large affairs and managing business on a scale of
llrst-class magnitude, the situation would have been
very unfortunate. We should have had to enter upon
our new era with a feeling of doubt and hesitation.
There would have been a widespread fear that the
hopes of the people would be baffled and the funds
voted for improvement be wasted by reason of the
incapacity of the men who would have charge of the
ia<k of inaugurating the work during the coming
two years.
The candidacy of Henry J. Crocker puts an end to
ail fears of that kind and affoTds all conservative
citizens a leadership which can be frankly accepted
without regard to party affiliations. He is one of
the foremost business men of the State and has
achieved notable successes in many lines of work.
Of the younger business men of the time none is
more widely or more favorably known. The work he
prrformed in the redemption of the wine industry of
the State is of itself sufficient to attest his capacity
and his energy in the management of complex busi
ness affairs. No part of the work of administration
on municipal business will require greater sagacity
or greater executive ability than Mr. Crocker has
displayed time and again in the great enterprises he
-has carried to success, and accordingly the conserva
tive elements of the community can support him
with a firm assurance that he can be counted on in
office to take care that every dollar of public rev
enue is expended in a manner that will bring to the
city its full value.
From this time on the trend of popular sentiment
in favor of Mr. Crocker may be expected to become
more and more noticeable. It is important that it be
so, for the taxpayers and the conservative working
men of the city cannot afford to divide their votes
between two candidates at such an emergency as this.
The discontented elements of the population are not
so strong as they were two years ago, but they are
still formidable. A divided conservatism means a
new triumph for the Ruef and Schmitz machine. The
city would be again delivered over to a faction whose
leaders would not keep faith even with one another,
and the scandals of the past two years would be
greatly magnified in the two years that are to come.
The issue is plain. There is an important munici
pal work to be done, and Henry j. Crocker is the
â¢-ole mayoralty candidate who has the capacity, the
training and the experience to rightly perform it.
It is now for the people to intrust the work to the
right man, and to aid him in performing it by electing
with him his colleagues on the Republican ticket, so
that he can have an harmonious administration.
Langley's airship ha? gone to smash, but he still
has his courage and his confidence in the ultimate
realization of his dream of years ai.d labor and
money. The qualities of success^ to which he still
holds tenaciously are perhaps better than any that
were incorporated in the defunct machine that failed
to rule the air.
THE Stockton Independent commends the Board
of Education because it has offered prizes for
competitive plans to be frfrnished .by landscape
gardeners for the improvement of the grounds of the
Stockton High School. The Independent says that
the action is unprecedented.
Contemplation of a vista of the grounds in ques
tion, as presented through the realistic outgivings of
the writer of the article, indicates that not. only is
the proposition new, but that conditions in Stockton
generally are novel. Many things are best shown
by means of contrast. Advocacy of a plan to im
prove the grounds of the public schools in San Fran
cisco, for instance, would excite derision for the most
part, for very few of our schools have as much as a
grass plat of even limited size. There is a "ribbon
of green'" that flanks pleasantly the Girls' High
School on Geary street. In nearly every public school
in San Francisco the children are so numerous and
the school yards are so small that the children are
forbidden to move faster than a walk in the inclosures
at recess time. If they transgress this rule they are
"reported" and must suffer the due penalty.
But how is it with the Stockton High School's
most fortunate pupils? "The grounds," say the In
dependent, "comprise about twelve acres. A pe
rusal of the specifications will show that the contest
ants for the prizes must incorporate in the plans the
preservation of the natural oaks and the natural
watercourses and provide for athletic grounds."
Children are born to run and to shout, to engage in
athletic games, to fill their lungs with fresh air, to
build up jnuscle and to accumulate vim and energy
for the battle that attends the lives of the majority
of persons in their maturity in this driving, restless
country. Stockton stands Jbefore the State with a
wealth of school grounds, an amplitude of breathing
area that points the way back to the sound sense and
forethought on the part of some person or persons
instrumental in the acquisition of school surround
ings. San Francisco children have been less fortu
nate in their municipal forebears, who would seem to
have thought that a box schoolhouse large enough
to hold several hundred boys and girls of the rest
less ages during several hours a day and a small out
side area into which the children could be crowded
and left practically motionless when they ought to
have room to run was all that would be required.
The Independent says that the action of the School
.Board is in some measure the fruit of the consistent

The usurpations of the Senate are of many kinds.
One of the boldest is the extent to which it has
taken from the House control over money bills, not
withstanding the plain statement of the constitution
that all bills for raising reveriue shall originate in the
House of Representatives. In other directions it is
noted that the Senate has so far encroached upon the
constitutional powers of the President that it has vir
tually taken out of his hands much of the work of
negotiating treaties.
As to the remedy for the evil Mr. McCall says: "The
four years' term of the President is, too short for a
struggle with the Senate, and its part in* executive
transactions is 59 great that any such struggle would
expose an administration to failure. The period of
life of the House of Representatives is still shorter,
and its term would be likely to come to an end be
fore a contest between the two houses would ac
quire any great momentum. .* . * * As I have said,
an amendment to the constitution depriving States of
their equal membership in the Senate is not within
the range of possibilities, as such arf* amendment
would require the unanimous consent of all the States.
* * * The only practical hope of-eTen a partial
remedy lies in the jealous insistence by the House
upon its constitutional prerogatives. .If it should do
that, it would be more likely to'realize the advantage
of its position in a nation imbued with the demo
cratic idea. The doubtful powers of government
would gravitate toward the House, our laws would
become more popular in character, and would re
spond to broad and general needs in the community,
while the character of the Senate as a' conservative
body would be unimpaired."
The statement implies that Mr. CannonV word of
warning last spring was not hastily uttered and is not
without the approval of strong men in the House.
The odds, however, in such a struggle would be
heavily on the side of the Senate, and unless, the
House had a good ground on which to raise the
issue defeat would be certain. The question, of
course, is one of high importance and should issue be
joined between the two houses the contest would be
one of the most significant ever waged in parliamen
tary annals.
UPON the eve of adjournment of the last Con
gress Representative Cannon made a violent
attack upon the Senate for its methods of
doing business and virtually announced that it would
cither institute a reform of its own motion or the
House would compel it to do so. The speech was
sensational and attracted much attention at' the time,
for it was known that Cannon is to be Speaker of
the next House, and that if he chooses to do so he
can raise a conflict that will seriously disturb poli
tics for two years to come.
Since the adjournment of Congress very little has
been heard about the subject, but evidently it has not
been forgotten by the House leaders, for one of them
has contributed to the Atlantic Monthly an ex
haustive review of the rightful powers of the Senate
and of its usurpations of at the -expense of
the House on the one hand -and of the President on
the other.
In explaining how the Senate has managed to gain
an undue power in the government the writer, Con
gressman McCall, says: "The striking circumstance
in connection with the power oi the Senate is that it
holds the commanding place at the center of the
Government. It brings to mind the condition of
things in Europe under the feudal system, where the
nobles had the position between the King and the
people, and gradually encroached upon them both un
til they were able to Oppress bothâ a condition
which continued until a union was effected between
the people and the sovereign, and the feudal system
was finally overthrown. The Senate shares the pow
ers of legislation with the House and some of the
most important executive functions with the Pjesi
dent. The latter is unable to appoint a collector or
a postmaster, or even a member of his own official
household, without the Senate's consent. Such im
portant powers, exercised at the center of the state,
would naturally increase by encroachment upon both
extremes, and they certainly would not diminish."

Yesterday morning at 9:30 o'clock the
marriage of J. W. McDonald Jr. and Miss
Mae O'Toole was celebrated at St. Agnei
Church, on Page street, between
Masonic avenue and Ashbury street,
by Father Kirby. The bride 13
a charming girl of many mental at
tainments, and by her striking personality
has endeared herself to a legion of
friends. The groom is well known as the
secretary of the City Street Improvement
Company of this city and Is possessed of
a host of friends, who attribute to him
the rare gifts of a clever raconteurâ and
this is a reputation not lightly achieved.
Owing to recent bereavements In the fam
ily of the bride the wedding: was rather a
quiet affair, only relatives and close
friends Deing bidden to the reception and
breakfast which followed. The bride was
gowned in a dainty robe of white point
d'esprit and was assisted at the altar by
her sister Eleanor. The groom was at
tended by his brother, Walter McDonald.
The happy pair left for the East on the
overland last night and will be absent
about six weeks, during which they will
visit the larger cities of the East. On
their return they will occupy the new
home on Ashbury street now in course of
construction.
The guest of honor. Miss Hazard, is
likewise a Kappa Kappa Gamma mem
ber, and the sorority house, to which so
many memories in the after years will
cling, is to be the scene of the reception
that follows the nuptials. The ceremony
will be celebrated in tbe Presbyterian
church, Berkeley.
The young hostess will entertain four
teen guests, all of whom ara members
of the Kappa Kappa Gamma Sorority of
Berkeley. She will be assisted by her
mother, Mrs. Henry Moffat, and her sis
ters, Mi3s Henrietta Moffatt and Mrs.
Sharp. .
A luncheon will be given to-day by Miss
Emma Moffatt in honor of Miss Irene
Hazard of San Diego, whose marriage to
Mr. Gerlinger of Portland will soon
occur.
Then ten young sons d Mars, with
their ten bonny brides, will be in San
Francisco within the next ten days to
make ready for sailing to the Philippines
on the good ship Sheridan. It Is whis
pered in army circles that the transport
will be decked from stem to stern in
tulle and Bride roses.
These gallant fellows have distinguished
themselves in the service since the mil
itary eruption of .'98, and have made
good records as brave soldiers. And the
magnificent stand they have made against
the anti-matrimonial bull of General Cor
bin has strengthened the reputation they
won in the late war. Brave fellows, they!
One of the embarrassing . features of
this wholesale nuptializing was the dif
ficulty each groom experienced in pro
curing best men, ushers and the neces
sary comradeship, for all the popular of
ficers had similar affairs of their own on
hand, and they really hadn't time! And
as a forlorn subterfuge, a few married
officers were pressed into service. This
custom, however. Is voted a falhire, as
they â without an exception â assumed
lugubrious attitudes as they stood beside
their friends at the altar, and were
wholly inefficient in their duty to- brace
them up. Whether it was timidity or
reminiscence is a difficult guess, but mar
ried men at the altar are voted downâ
they lack the necessary verve for suc
cessful administration of duty. They may
make good soldiers, but they are poor
best men.
Matrimony is said to be a sporadic af
fection, becoming epidemic when fairly
started. It has broken out to an alarming
extent in army circlesâ to be explicit, in
the Twenty-second United States Infantry
â and has already spread to twelve officers,
namely, Captain John R. R. Hanrey,
Captain David L. Stone and Lieutenants
Adolph H. Huguet. Lawrence Curtis,
William A. Kent, James Justice, Henry
A. Ripley, William W. Taylor, Harry
Parshall and Robert Whitfteld.

Miss Cottlow and made .his initial bow
Miss Augusta Cottlow, the eminent
planiste, gave her first concert Tuesday
evening in Lyric Hall, it being her first
appearance in San Francisco since she
played as a child some years ago with
the Bauer Symphony Orchestra. It may
be safely said that the prophecies made
long ago for the child pianlste were not
made In vain, and Miss Cottlow's per
formance -last evening warranted every
flattering expectation. There were tone
pictures a-plenty with the color laid on
with a generous but careful brush. Miss
Cottlow possesses a marvelous technique,
a rich imagination and a keen poetic in
sight into the purpose of the composer.
She has a finely drawn temperament and
a dignified manner. From the brilliant
passages in the Liszt Etude, where tho
keen, glistening notes literally came in
a crystal shower, to the stately tread
of a Bach motif or the passion and ro
mance of Chopin, she is always the art
ist. The Brahma Caprice was a study'
in tone production and warmly poetic,
with shadowy suggestions of half veiled
bits of counterpoint. In the control of the
dynamics, Miss Cottlow shows a broad
sweep, to the uttermost limits of sound.
The audience was deservedly enthusiastic
and was rewarded with two encores, a
Scotch dance by Beethoven and an A minor
Mazourka of Chopin. The Liszt Etude
and Polonaise served best to show to ad
vantage the artist's great technique. She
has a fascinating legato, even in tho
most rapid passages, and a trill that is
inimitable. The Chopin Scherzo was a
delicious bit of legato work, woven
through a woof of shimmering treble song
with a presto finale. After leaving here,
some years ago. Miss Cottlow concertized
for two or three years, and then went
to Europe and studied with Busoni. Aft
er her present engagement she goes East
to play with Scheel during tho coming
season.
The double bill of two operas. "Caval
ierly Rustlcan*:i and "I'Pagliacci,' 1 filled
a Tivoli night to overflowing with melody
and with dramatic action. This was the
treat that was afforded Tuesday evening.
Both operas brought to the fore singers
strong in public favor. Signorina Line de
Benedetto and Signor Agostlno were In
"C&valleria Rusticana." In "I'Pagliacel"
were Signorina Tina de Spada, Signor
Adamo Gregoretti and Signor Ischierdo.
The other people were Zaninl, Nettie
Deglow, Miss Eugene Barker, Signor Cor
tesi and Signor Borghese, some in, one
cast and some in thÂ© other.
The announcement of the casts sug
gests richness. The actual performances
constituted a star night at the Tivoli.
Nothing was done in a perfunctory way
from the 'time the first note of "Caval
leria Rusticana" was heard until the final
drum beat of the second opera. Two lead
ing sopranos came into contrast. Both
struggled hard for a generous share of
applause. Agostino Justified his title to
be styled lyric. Ischierdo acted with ve
hemence and wore proudly the dramatic
bays. . Â¦ ' ; '.
Then there was a house wild with en
thusiasm over the premonitory song of
Gregoretti and pleased with the melodious
voice of Borghese. As for the orchestra,
it was. simply electric. Paul Stemdorff
gestured wildlyâ beat out rhythm, in
stilled precision, delicacy and force into
his players, steered them through all the
musical Bhoals and quicksands that im
periled their course and brought them
triumphantly into the haven.
Generally, while there is enough of
dramatic action in the two operas, tHe
joint performance as a whple might bet
ter be styled lyrical than dramatic. Sweet
sounds and graceful musical conceits
dominated. The famous Intermezzo, bat
tle scarred with its many engagements
with myriad orchestras of diverse ideas,
still proved its claim to vitality by secur
ing a general demand for repetition as the
violins wailed sweetly and the horns sank
from deep to deeper levels by gradations,
away down among the profoundest leger
lines, and the whole wound up with rising
inflection.
It is hardly necessary to analyze the
peculiarities of the leading singers. Bene
detto especially distinguished herself as
Santuzza. She won the first "bravos"
that were plentiful as the evening wore
on. Her voice was in fine condition. So
was De Spada's.
Something of praise should be awarded
to Eugenia Barker, who has an extremely
pleasing voice which she used well. There
was no mistake made by the manage
ment in putting on the double bill. Al
though the hour was late when the finale
came, there was none too much of the
music.
The honesty and energy of the President will clean
it out. now. the same qualities in Jackson did the
same service in his day. But the history of the de
partment gives no guarantee that the scandals will
cease, or that the waste of Government in the admin
istration of a business will ever cease. So far no
watchfulness, nor law, nor penalty, has sufficed to
keep that business straight, and it is unlikely that any
ever will.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT is thorough in
everything he undertakes. His is the gospel of
â¢work, and he proposes that work shall show
in all things pertaining to the public interest while he
is President. The General Postofficc has become the
center of long accumulating abuses. It is a colossal
business, run under all the disadvantages under
which Government administers a business enterprise.
President Roosevelt ordered the investigation which
has disclosed these conditions, and now orders it
continued until the cleansing is complete.
He puts his determination in terse and epigram
matic fashion by saying that he will complete the in
vestigation so that no other party will ever find any
thing to do. This is not only duty and patriotism,
but it is good politics. The political opposition has
tried to make capital out of the postal affair, but
without success, as the energy infused into the in-.,
quiry has left nothing to be desired in the way of
thoroughness. It has been a part of the programme
for the minority in Congress to introduce a resolution
raising a Congressional investigation, but the Presi
dent proposes that such an investigation shall find
the work so thoroughly done that it will have no
function.
This is satisfactory to every fair-minded man of
any party. But when the work is done, and fully
done, as the President docs everything, there re
mains a lesson which must not be permitted to es
cape the attention of the country. From the begin
ning the business of managing the mails has been rec
ognized as the invasion of a purely business field by
the Government. Administering justice, caring for
the public domain, managing the army and navy, the
pensions, patents, revenues and foreign affairs, are in
stantly recognized as among the political concerns
of Government. To care for and control them is
what Government is for. They include the conserva
tion of thepublic property and interests and the exer
cise of the proper police powers of Government.
The postoffice, however, comes under none of
these heads. It is the administration of a vast busi
ness agency, and since early in the history of the
country it has been the leakage department of the
Government. Its administration produces a large an
nual deficit, which has to be made good by taxation,
and from time to time it presents a record of corrup
tion and crime such as is not seen in any of the
purely political departments of administration. The
same characteristics appear wherever a State is en
gaged in business, as witnessed by New York's ad
ministration of the Erie canal, which under all par
ties is a history of extravagance, waste and corrup
tion.
But we have the postorfice and will always have it,
as an example of Government in business, and the
best that can be done is to minimize its evils and
its waste. Suppose, however, that we take over into
Government ownership and administration all of
the interstate public utilities, the railroads (steam and
electric), the telegraphs, telephones, steamboat lines
and transportation business, with more than a mil
lion of Government employes to operate them, and
the billions of money required in those activities, in
the light of the example furnished by the postal busi
ness what result can be expected? It is idle to talk
about the safeguards of civil service. The Postoffice
Department has them all. It is hedged about by
minute statutory and administrative regulations, and
is blanketed by the civil service law; but it is a busi
ness in the hands of Government, and its temptations
and opportunities prove stronger than all laws and
all regulations and all watchfulness.

THE POSTAL INVESTIGATION.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1903.
It is strange with what stupid recklessness some
of our drunken, gilded youth prepare themselves for
violent deaths. The young man who entered a saloon
recently and at the point of a revolver forced an un
offending citizen to take a drink may meet the
wrong man some night and learn the lesson that
money easily won and criminally spent does not give
any one a blackguardly or ruffianly^ privilege over the
rest of us.
France and England, after centuries of racial an
tagonisms and ill-disguised hatred of one another,
have signed a treaty in which they agree to submit
any future misunderstandings between themselves. to
arbitration. This is one of the splendid results of
modern diplomatic courtesies. Out of the reciprocal
visits of the President of France and the King of
England come benefits of incalculable measure to
two great nations.
The gratifying niews comes from Washington that
whether Japan and Russia fight or not no harm can
come to us from the row or the big fuss that seems
now to precede a quarrel. Besides, it is suggested,
#ve have two treaty ports in Manchuria, anyway, and
our trade facilities will suffer no interruption. It is
good once in a while to cool our fighting blood in
the calm satisfaction of the knowledge that the gold
of our fighting friends is coming our way.

Detroit. Mich.Mayor Schmitz Speaks at Turk-Street
Temple and Richmond Hall.
Mayor Schmitz was the central figure
at a. large gathering of anherents of the
Union Labor party held in the Turk-street
Temple last night. The hall was taxed to
its full eapaclty.-
The Mayor was late in appearing, and
during the Interim the crowd was enter
tained by addresses from various candi
dates of the Union Labor party. Walter
Gallagher, .the Un|on Labor spellbinder,
Lane next addressed a meeting in the
Thirty-fifth Assembly District, at Mission
Turn YereJn : Hall, on Eighteenth street,
At Steimke Hall, In the Forty-first Dis
trict, where he held his first session, some
miscreant had sprinkled red pepper on the
floor, which made itself manifest very
shortly after Mr. Lane commenced to
speak. Tha audience was small. He
chose for the principal theme the subject
of the expenditure of the 118,000,000 for
the Improvement of the city and Its envi
ronments. Mr. Lane stated that he had
not gone into this fight for the emolu
ments of the office, but simply to try to
protect the welfare of the city and its
citizens. He said he could more
money If he stuck to the practice of law
than the highest office in tha municipality
would pay him. Judge J. F. Sullivan was
chairman of the occasion.
Red Pepper Interferes With First and
Cold Audience Dampens Second.
Franklin K. Lane addressed two meet-
Ings last night.
LANE MAKES TWO SPEECHES.
He asked for a sympathetic set of of
ficials behind him and especially dwelt on
the need for a friendly Board of Super
visors, without which he said ho was pow
erless to accomplish many of the things
he had planned for the city.
He scored Franklin K. Lane, who, he
said, was personally responsible for cir
culating false and scurrilous literature re
garding the Union Labor candidate) for
Mayor. He said he had worked hard and
tried to be Mayor of the whole people,
without regard to class, and If he were
re-elected he promised to maintain this
course, avoiding any mistakes he had
made in the past and instituting many re
forms in the future. ' '
He contrasted his administration with
that of Phelan's. comparing the labor dif
ficulties under both and claiming credit
for the fact that the strike of the street
car men was not as bloody and riotous
as that of the teamsters. He pointed out
the present prosperity of the city, which
he credited to his administration and
asked if it were not a bad plan to change
present satisfactory conditions for the
empty promises held out by his oppo
nents.
Mayor Srhmltz aopeared about 9 o'clock
and was given a hearty greeting. Quite
a number of women were In the* audi
ence and they joined in the welcome. A
sweet little girl handed th# Mayor a

pended while those present exercised their
vocal chords in according a lusty welcome
to the head of the ticket.
The Mayor spoke briefly, but said a good
many things In his remarks that touched
responsive echoes In the hearts of his
audience, and he was cheered vigorously.
He regretted that his party had not the
support of a single newspaper In the city,
but said he would rather make this fight
without their aid than be ruled by a
newspaper boss In the administration of
his duties.
Referring to some literature respecting
his past administration that has been cir
culated by the Democrats, he said: "I am
not making a mud-slinging campaign and
I deprecate this method of getting votes.
I would rather go down to defeat than to
mako my canvass by besmirching the
names of my opponents. This plan of
campaign. I regret to say, haa been adopt

abetted and countenanced this work, well
knowing it to be false. ,1 hold him per
sonally responsible for* this despicable
method of campaigning."
The Mayor referred to the Increase in
building operations in this city, and con
trasted the condition with that of Eastern
cities, where it was stated that there had
been a falling off in these lines. He at
tributed' this to the fact that while labor
troubles had been rife East and West
they had been. handled In this city with
proper regard to the workers and the In
vestors alike.
After Mayor Schmitz had finished an ef
fort was made to continue the meeting
with other speakers, but they wasted
their voices on an array of disappearing
backs, and shortly afterward the meeting
broke up. ,
Previous to this meeting Mayor Schmitz
addressed a big crowd at Clement street
and Fourth avenue, In the Richmond dis
trict. Five hundred people gained admis
sion,' and some were unable to squeeze in.

He took ipleasure in stating that the
Germans of San Francisco were with him

would assist him in securing the office to
which he aspired.
Judge Bahrs. told of his early life; told
of his manly efforts, to get an education
and of his ambitions. He touched a re
sponsive chord in the minds of his hear
ers by telling how hard 'he had labored
as a boy In a soap factory and how hard
he had studied at night In order that he
might fit himself to be a lawyer. The
speaker grew eloquent as he warmed to
his task and he was Interrupted time and
again by applause. He did not mince
words in discussing the incumbent. He
charged Dr. Dodge with using his office
for his own aggrandizement and openly
stated that Dodge was guilty of "graft

In closing his speech he said: "I say it
is a great honor and a great .privilege to
be a representative of the Republican
party as its nominee and it w)kild be the
extreme honor of my life to be \lected to
that position and to be able to serve you

HENRY J. CROCKER has proved beyond doubt that he is a friend of organized labor. It was due to his good offices that the
linemen and the head officials of the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company came together and settled the strike,
which had been in progress for more than six months. Others tried to settle the differences between the union men and the cor
poration, but without success. He not only gave vital aid to the workingmen, but made it possible for all men to return to their
employment. Such a thing as a "blacklist" does not exist. That the union men appreciate the efforts of Mr. Crocker is evidenced
by the following letter:

BAHRS HITS FROM SHOULDER.
During his term he was called upon to
decide the famous "Fresno rate case."
He found foj; the people against the rail
road, and fhat powerful organization,
which at that time dominated the poli
tics of the city and rounty. prevented his
renomination at the next election. With
out a nomination or the support of the
press, he ran independently and almost
scored a victory, polling lÂ»,700 votes.
While always taking an active interest
in politic?, he has not been a candidate
for office since his defeat for Superior
Judge. In June, however, his signal abll-.
Ities were recognized by Mayor Schmitz.
who appointed him a member of the Civil
Service Commission.
Accordingly he left a position worth $100
a month and brgan clerking in a law
office at $3 per week. When he attained
his majority he was admitted to the bar
and his rise in h!s profession was phe
nomenal. In 1??4 he was elected Supe
rior Judge on the Republican ticket and
was one of the best though one of the
youngest Judges that ever served on the
bench In th-ls city.
sessor of the city and county of San
Francisco to fill the vacancy on the ticket
caused by the declination of Charles S.
Laumelster, who was nominated to the
X>osition by the Republican convention.
Judge Bahrs' acceptance was received
joyfully by the people. lie Is regarded
as the strongest man who could be se
lected and undoubtedly he will make a
magnificent run. His record is without
a blemish. He was born in San Fran
cisco and In a great measure is a self
made man. After a course in the public
pchools he engaged in the business of
soap maklns. When he was IS years of
age he had attained as high wages as
were paid in his trade and concluded that
if he expected further advancement he
would have to enter a profession.

Judge George H. Bahrs, candidate for
Aepebsor, who was put on the ticket yes
terday, attended the meeting and deliv
ered one of the most forcible talks ever
rrade by a candidate for election. He has
taken the field against Dr. Washington

Th* statement mad" by Mr. Crocker
â¢was borne out a few minutes later when
James M. Queeney. a member of Ixical
No. 2S3 cf the I*Sr.emen'Â« Union, was In
troduced. The latter said the Republican
candidate was entitled to all the credit
for brir.p'.r.s? about a settlement of the
etrike. HÂ« said fomc people were trying
to take the credit away from Mr. Crock
er, but they Â¦would not pure^ed, as h<Â» had
Tieen Instrumental In Fettling the differ
ences of the union men and their em
plcyere. Richard Condon, thÂ© union man
who told Mr. Crocker h? was on the
blacklist and was takon back to the tel
ephone company through his efforts, was
jrratcful to the Republican nominee for
the kindness he had done him. In a
fhort rpeech to fellow union men Mc-
Queeney eaid:
Fellow union men: I have been a lineman
for th# telephone company and my friend, the
Hon. Henry J. Crocker, settled our strike. I
could not eet back to the telÂ«Â»r>hone company
â¢Â¦n account of doing too much work in thÂ«
interests of my union. He got me back my

Gentlemen, I wish you would do all you can
for Mr. Crocker, the Republican candidate for
Mayor, and Henry H. L<ynch. candidate for
fheriff. <Apj>!ausO
Theodore Lunstedt, candidate for Su
pervisor, made a pleasing speech and wac
nven a rally. Dr. Morris, candidate for

told what a pood official he would make
if Vlected to office. Speeches were made
Tiy Harry Baehr, Percy V. Long and
Maurice Asher.
UNION MEN TESTIFY
itfephone linemen's strike. The nominee
for Mayer was loth to say anything about
the matter, but bis friends advised him
ta do so, otherwise they themselves would
tell of his good offices in behalf of organ
ized labor.
Leon Samuels was chairman of the big
meeting. He introduced the various can
didates and kei>t the meeting on the go
to its conclusion. Almost every candidate
on the ticket appeared before the large
patherir.g and received a warm reception.
When the Republican nominee for
Mayor entered the hall the place resound
ed with shouts of enthusiasts. He was
cheered and cheered and he was forced to
bow repeatedly to his friends. He shook
hands with many voters and was delight
ed to find that his button was being worn
by hundreds of residents of the districts.
CROCKER IS CHEERED.
After all the other candidates had been
introduced, Mr. Crocker was presented to
the audience and. when the enthusiasm
had subsided, ppoke as follows:

Meeting.
Campaign Committee
Doing Active
Work.
HENRY J. CROCKER, the Repub
lican candidate for Mayor, con
tinues to gain friends among the
workingmen of the city. They like
his simple, unostentatious style of
campaigning. He has many old
acquaintances and warm personal friend*
in every district of the city and every
day he gets requests to visit cjubs and ad
dress meetings. It is mentioned to Mr.
Crocker's credit that he does not slins
mud at the candidates on the rival tickets.
He 1Â» making a clean, honorable and dig
nified canvass and Is daily gaining in
strength and prestige. He impresses citi
zens and taxpayers with tha belief that
he will do something for the betterment
of San Francisco when he is elected
Mayor. There is a good deal of talk in
business and industrial circles in the city
of the shameful neglect of public duty
in many of the departments of the munici
pality. It seems to many of the taxpay
ers that the men who are paid generous
salaries to attend to official duty are out
chasing for office. It is mentioned that
individual enterprise during the last two
years has accomplished much for San
Francisco, but the work of tha enterpris
ing citizen has received no support or en
couragement from the city authorities.
The Republicans maintain that Mr.
Crocker will do something for San Fran
cisco. He will check the waste and ex
travagance at the City Hall and get
something in return for the vast amount
of money annually raised to support the
local government
SCHMITZ ON THE WANE.
Mayor Schmitz will not get anything
like as big a labor vote as he got two
years ago. He counts on the Fire De
partment and the Police Department to
make good his losses in labor circles. He
also expects that Ruef will enlist a strong
following In the tenderloin. Politicians
that are giving clo*Â« study to the various
phases of the campaign say that the
Schmitz star is on the wane. It is noted
that Schmitz loses his temper and reviles
his opponents. The versatility of style
and the genial tone which characterized
his Democratic addresses in New York are
lacking. Daily companionship with Ruef
and the pleasing spectacle of Parry and
the colt do not afford him consolation.
Lane is displaying a little speed and some
originality. Night before last he trotted
out the Trojan horse as an offset to the
Parry colt. Lane has not made any spe
cial effort since his fizzle at the Turk
street Temple to break into the Union
Labor party. He is soliciting the, support
of workingmen on the ground of Gavin
McNab's devotion to the cause of labor.
There is no change in the general situa
tion. Crocker is leading". Schmitz is sec
ond and Lane is third. There are many
Indications of a bitter and ugly fight be
tween Schmitz and Lace for the honor of
second place.
REPUBLICANS HOPEFUL.
The Republicans are supremely con
fident. In factihere is danger of over
confidence. Politicians would not be sur
prised if Crocker received thirty thousand
votes on November 3. The average Re
publican vote in this city at the last
gubernatorial election was 23,000. The Re
publican vote Is registered and it is up
to the party leaders, the workers and
the candidates to bring the men to the
polls on election day. Ordinarily the vote
at a municipal election is lighter than that
of the preceding State election, but the
campaign now on in San Francisco is ex-"
ceptional In its spirit and enterprise.
Many Republicans regard it as the first
skirmish of the great national battle of
1904. The Army and Navy Republican
League is already in the field as an ac
tive agent in support of the party ticket.
The Governor of the State enjoins Repub
licans to support the admirable ticket.
United States Senators and Representa
tives in Congress may lend their active
support before the close of the contest.
Moreover the party Is well organized in
every Assembly district. All signs point
to a very large Republican vote and a
signal Republican victory.
REJECTS PETITION.
An examination by Registrar Walsh
yesterday of the petition of the Non-
Partisan Convention that it b*Â» aceordM
a place on the municipal, ballot at the
next election disclosed the fact that the
petition lacks 445 names of registered vot
ers to permit of favorable action on the
petition.
Th.9 petition was signed by 2307 signers.
of which 883 are not registered and thirty
six could not b? located. This leaves 13SS
registered voters who signed the petition.
Three per cent of the vote cast at the
last gubernatorial election, or 1833 signers
are necessary to Insure the placing of an
outside political party on the ticket.
Registrar Walsh had forty men work
ing up to 2:30 o'clock this morning in
vestigating the names on the petition,
which comprised twenty-five books.
At anÂ»early hour this morning the pro- *
rooters of the so-called non-partisan move
ment had failed to produce the number of
petitioners required by law.
Many of the signers which the ring
leaders of the graft sought to foist on
the Election Commission were found to
be among the unregistered and many of
those who were registered participated in
the late primary election. The names of
dead men were also used to enlarge the
petition. Last night Arthur G. Fisk and
Jacob Steppacher on behalf of the United
Republican League filed a protest in the
Registrar's office setting forth that the
petition was insufficient and fraudulent
and ought to be rejected.

very apathetic. Possibly the red pepper

the tameness of his speech, but be that
as It may, his remarks simply fell dead

Puerl Wllkerson was so disgusted over
the ride Lee Jackson gave Warte Micht
in the mile and fifty yards handicap that
he threatened to ship his stable back to
Oakland. The colt was an even money
favorite, and Jackson cut out a pace that
made the track smoke. After reeltnir off

up, passed the tiring three-year-old, win

LOS ANGELES. Oct! 14.â A fair sized
but not overdemonstrative crowd saw tha
handsome mare Rosie Woodburn take the
11000 Southern California stake for the
2:24 class trotters at the track this after
noon. The harness talent appeared at a
loss for a favorite. Zombowyette. Sutter
and the ultimate winner at different
stages of the betting enjoyed the call.
Rosie Woodburn finally held the position
secure and went out and won three
straight heats in sing-song fashion. Sut
ter annexed second money.
As usual, the field book did a land of
fice business on the five running events,
but the books in the ring were not be
sieged by players. Anything that looks
to have a chance is held at 6 to 3, and
thfs is gradually having its effect. Three
of the first choices were laid away,
among them Tower of Candles, a 9 to 10
chance from Caesar Young's barn. This
last mentioned catastrophe ruffled the
feelings of the oranee pickers, for they
cannot imagine such a short priced one
going by the board. The mare, with
Chandler up. skinned along In front for
six and a half furlongs, when she was
passed and beaten hands down by Con
stellator at odds of 3 to 1. The winner
covered the seven furlongs In 1:26, a track
record.

George Gardner Arrives.
George Gardner, who . holds the . light

arrived here from Chicago last night. , He
Is matched to box Fitzsimmons , on the

pounds now and expects to be at his best
Morris Levy will give Young Corbett
GO per cent of the receipts and three
round trip tickets from New York if fie
will fight Hanlon here -next month. Han
lon is willing, but Corbett" has not been
heard from in the matter.
The Brltt-Seiger fight still hangs in the
balance. Manager Greggains of the San
Francisco Athletic Club has; given his
ultimatum. He will be at Harry Corbott's
at 6 o'clock to-morrow night, when the
men were to weijrh in.
If Brltt is in such a condition then that
he cannot expect to fight during the pres
ent month Greggains will claim Brltt's
$500 forfeit and will proceed to make an
other match. Roach says he will not
claim his share of Britt's forfeit, but as
funds are reported low in his strong, box
he may be forced to claim some recom
pense for himself and Seiger.
Greggains will claim his share of the
forfeit money, he says, as a matter of
business. He would not expect Britt to
make any concessions if- he failed to
carry out his part of the contract.
A number of matches were spoken of
yesterday. Seiger offers to fight Hanlon
at 130 pounds, the weighing to be done
at. 6 o'clock. Hanlon holds out for ring
side, claiming Seiger would probably
weigh 134 pounds at the ringside if the
weight was . taken at 6 o'clock. . It is
Manager Roach's Intention to take
Seiger to San Rafael to-day, where he
will endeavor to get him down to 130
pounds. He will then determine what he
will do with Hanlon's offer.
Joe Gans wants to , come "West again
to fight Seiger, either here or in Los
Angeles. Seiger will meet him, but he
insists on Gans weighing 133 pounds at
6. o'clock. It is not considered possible
for the wily negro to do this.
The injury to Brltt is in the foot and
not in the ankle. It was placed in splints
yesterday and to-day massage will be ap
plied. If the injury yields to treatment.
Britt may be able to keep his engagement
later In the month.

BRIGHTON BEACH RACE TRACK.
Oct. 14.â Frank Miller, rider of Clytie In
the sixth race to-day, was thrown by a
fall, crushed by his mount, never recov
ered consciousness and was dead long
before the race crowd had started for the
city. The accident to Clytie was due to
the fact that Sonoma Bell fell at the half
mile pole and the dust caused by her fall
prevented Miller seeing the prostrate filly
right in his path. Clytie fell over Sonoma
Bell.
When the track ambulance reached the
little group Miller was unconscious. His
limp body was lifted Into an ambulance,
which was rapidly driven along the quar
ter stretch and into the paddock. Uni
formed officers lifted the stretcher upon
which Miller's body lay and conveyed it
to a room set apart for the use of in
jured riders. A large crowd, including
many women, gathered outside* the room
and to hide the youth from the sight of
the curious curtains were drawn acros3
the windows. Miller lived only a few min
utes.
The jockey was 2S years of age and a
Mexican by birth. He was brought North
by John J. McCafferty and afterward was
employed by Louis Stuart and William
Becker. The latter was his last regular
employer, although Clytie, which the
jockey was riding at the time of his fatal
accident, is the property of Benjamin
Eckert. It was said that Miller was en
gaged to be married to a daughter of
Michaels, the fruit dealer at the track. â¢
In the first race John E. . Madden's
crack two-year-old. The Minute Man,
ridden by Fuller, was injured during the
running and on the first turn beyond the
Judges' stand his rider dismounted be
cause the colt was hobbling on three legs.
It was a miracle that the colt did not fall
during the race. His off hind pastern
had sustained a compound fracture.
There was no evidence of any horse hav
ing jumped upon The Minute Man and
the cause of the accident could not be
ascertained.
The Minute Man was destroyed after
an examination had revealed the extent
of his injury. One bullet ended the ca
reer of the youngster, which had become
femous through defeating McChesney
upon the latter's first appearance on a
local race course. The Minute Man was
valued at $20,000. Only a few days ago he
won the cott division of the Matron
stakes at Morris Park. Summary:

this always, because we must not neglect
money-getting and the promotion of great enter
prises, Â¦which, as e\-crybody knows, are the
evidences of a nation's prosperity and influ
ence. A great many people and a great deal of
time are necessary to patriotically care for
these things; and Eomehow it is more pleasant
to promote the country's good and at the same
time- our own financial prospects In this way
than by habitually meddling in politics.
GARB OF IMMUTABLE FAITH.
There is an habitual associate of American
civic indifference and listles&ncss which re
inforces their malign tendencies and adds tre
mendously to the dangers that threaten our
body politic. This associate i>lays the role
of a smooth, insinuating confidence operator.
Clothed in the garb of immutable faith in the
invulnerability of our national greatness. It
invites our admiring gaze to the flight of the
American eagle, and assures us that no tem
pestuous weather can ever tire his wing. Thus
many good and honest men are approached
through their patriotic trust in our free insti
tutions and immense national resources, and
are Insidiously led to a condition of mind
which will not permit them to harbor the un
comfortable thought that any omission on their
part can check American progress or en
danger our country's continued development.
Have we not lived as a nation more than a
century; and have we not exhibited growth
and achievement In tvery direction that dis
credit all parallels In history? After us the
deluge. Why then need we bestir ourselves
and why disturb ourselves with public affairs?
The withdrawal of wholesome sentiment and
patriotic activity from political action on tho
I>art of those who are Indifferent to their
duty, or foolhardy in their optimism, open the
way for a ruthless and unrelenting enemy of
our free institutions. The abandonment of our
country's watch towers by those who should
be on guard and the slumber of the sentinels
who ehould never sleep, directly invite the
stealthy, approach and the pillage and loot of
the forces of selfishness and greed. These bale
ful enemies of patriotic effort will lurk every
where as long as human nature remains unre
gÂ«-nerate. but nowhere in the world can they
create ruch : desolations as In free America,
and nov.-herÂ« can they so cruelly destroy man's
highest and beet aspirations for self-govern
ment. It Is useless for us to blink the fact
that our scheme of government Is based upon
a cloee Interdependence of Interest and purpose
among those who make up the body of our
people. Let us be honest with ourselves. -If
our nation was built too .much upon senti
ment and If the rules of patriotism and be
iiiEmtT that were followed in its construction
nave proved too impractical, let us frankly ad
mit it. Hut if love of country, equal oppor
tunity and genuino brotherhood in citizenship
are worth the pains and trials that gave them
birth, and if we E till believe them to be worth
preservation and that they have the inherert
vigor and beneficence, to make our Â¦ republic
'""Â«. our people happy, let us . strongly
hold them in lov e and devotion. Then it shall
be given us to plainly see that nothing Is
more unfriendly to the motives that underlie
0Ur wu "S ? ? dl 2 c * than th * selfishness: and
cupidity that look upon freedom and law and
order only as so many agencies In aid; of their
deigns. Our government was " made by pa
triotic unselfish, sober-minded men for the
control of protection of a patriotic ' unselfish
and sober-minded people. It is suited to such
a people; .but for those who are selfish cor
ruptand unpatriotic It is the worst govern
ment on earth. It Is so constructed that it
needs for its successful operation the constant
care and guiding hand of the people's abidTmr
faith and love; a^d not only iHhi, u^rS
ting guidance necessary to keep our national
mechanism true to lu work, but the fauii
and love which prompt it are the best safe
guards against selfish citizenship. Give to our
people something that will concentrate their
common affection and solicitous care and let
.that be their country's good; give them a pur
pose that stimulates them to -unite in loftv
endeavorâ and let that purpose be- a demon
stration of the sufficiency and beneficence of
our popular rule â and we shall find that in
their political thought there will be no place
for the suggestions of sordldness and pelf
Who will say that this is now our happy
condition? u not our public life saturated
with the indecent demands of Â¦ selfishness?
More than this, can any of us doubt the ex
istence of ttill more odious and detestable
e\ils which, with steady cankering growth, are
more <lirectly than all others threatening our
safety and national life? I speak of the cor
ruption of our suffrage/ open and notorious,
of the buying and selling of political places
for money, the ' purchase of political favors
and privileges and the traffic In official duty
for personal gain. These ; things are con
fessedly common. Every Intelligent* man knows'
that ; they have grown from small â¢ beginnings
until they hare reached : frightful- proportions
of malevolence; . and yet respectable citizens

STATESMEN WHO DELIVERED
ADDRESS AT CHICAGO COM
MERCIAL CLUB BANQUET.
The roads which comprise the South
eastern Freight Association and those in
the Transcontinental Freight Association
until recently have been making through
rates from: Tennessee, Georgia and other
Southern States to the Pacific Coast and
vice versa. The Southeastern lines, how
ever, for the past five years have been
dissatisfied with the divisions they got out
of the through rate, but their demands
for a larger divsion were refused. The
Southeastern roads then canceled their
east-bound rates from the Pacific Coast.
That was during July and since then ship
pers from or ,to California ,have had to
bill their goods twice.
The lines retaliated by
abolishing west-bound rates and the
manufacturers were left without through
rates. This state of affairs led to the
closing down of many factories in "the
South in the past few months. Formerly
they were given a through rate of about
$1 45 for their product to California.
Now the lowest commission rate amounts
to $1 65. They "lost heavily on goods they
had agreed to lay down in California at a
certain price and are afraid to sell ahead
on ', contract. Cotton goods - have been
shipped around Cape Horn to California
for. the first time in decades. The South
eastern roads have two alternatives which
they are debatingâ whether to ask the
transcontinental lines to go in with them
on a horizontal increase of about 10 or
more per cent on this business or to raise
their own separate rates to points where
the goods are turned over to the Western
lines. , Many Southern manufacturers
claim that a raise in rates will kill their
business. Â¦ â¢Â¦ Â¦
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 14.â Behind
closed doors at tha Gait House prominent
traffic officials of transcontinental and
southeastern roads to-day discussed the
question of cross-continent and gulf rates,
upon ' which they could not agree last
week in Chicago. The situation has de
veloped into. a. fight on the part of the
roads throughout the section bounded by
the Ohio River on the north and the Mis
sissippi on ; the west, against the Western
transcontinental lines. . â¢ -
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â Members of the
governing committee of the j New* York
Stock Exchange ,. in full session had a
lengthy talk last night over a matter
which has been agitating many stock
brokers for more than a year past. The
subject was Brown Bros. *& Co.'s Issue 'of
bonds of the United-;. Railroads of "San
Francisco, In a.' wrangle concerning-, which
lawsuits innumerable have been Instituted
and much bad feeling engendered.
Zlmmermann & { Forshay, members of
the Stock Exchange, -were principals in
the hearing last night. : jThe governing
committee failed to make any announce
ment on the result of its lengthy session.
None of the officers of .the exchange
would discuss the affair, from which it is
inferred . that no decision was reached.
The claims of E. & C. Randolph, which
are almost indentical with those of a
score of pthers, .were presented and Zim
mermann & Forshay, who have begun
suits against various stockholders, had
the floor to put their side of the question.
Ledgers and other records were presented
and it is understood that a thorough
hearing was given the entire matter.- \
The trouble grew out of the fact that
bonds distributed in San Francisco' by
the banking house of Brown Bros. & Co.
floated back to this market before the
whole issue' was made. Zlmmermann &
Forshay had been negotiating the sale of
bonds to their clients at a certain price
when bonds began to be traded in the
curb market: at a figure several points
below.. When no delivery was made on
persistent appeals the Zlmmermann * firm
made some "cross sales" and bought
bonds considerably above par. Then they
sued various brokers with whom they had
contracts for the difference between: the
price at which they, originally bought
the bonds and the "under the rule" prices.
The other brokers replied that they had
not secured their bonds from Brown
Bros. & Co. and that there had not been
an issue. On the other hand the Zim
mermann firm stated that there had been
an issue and gave tangible evidence of it.
It is. understood the governing commit
tee of the Stock Exchange considered the
complicated affair last night in its en
tirety, but it is doubted that the commit
tee has the authority to adjudicate a mat
ter of this description. . ' -^

MANILA, Oct. 14.â The crew of the boat
in which Johnston and Herman, the run
away constabulary officers, accompanied
by one constable, started from Gulmbal
for Cagayanes Island, attacked the out

CHICAGO, Oct. 1*.â Former Presi
dent Grover Cleveland was the
principal speaker to-night at the
annual bar.auet of the Commer
cial Club in the Auditorium Hotel.
The subject discussed by Cleveland was
"American Good Citizenship" and he
dwelt at length on the necessity of every
citizen doing: his part to make political
action what it should be. This is the first
time in eight years that Cleveland ha*
visited Chicago and he received an en
thusiastic greeting when he appeared at
the speaker's tabie. His speech in full
follows :
Mr. President and O*ntlemen: I am
Â»-ertain that it is not necessary to as
eure you of the pleasure it affords me to meet
the members of the Commercial Club of Chi
cago. You must know, as well as if you were
toid a thousand times, that it is not in human
nature to be less than delighted by your open
handed hospitality and hearty greeting.
As I understand my situation, I am under
bonds to keep the peace if possible, by eschew
ing politics in the few words I shall spÂ«ak to
r.ight. and I hope I may fulfill the condition
cf my bond and avoid disturbing those most
suspicious of my conduct if I deal with that
eld. old topic, American good citizenship.
There is danger that iny subject is so familiar
and to trite es to lack interest. This doss not
recessarilr result from a want of appreciation
cf the importance of rood citizenship, nor from
a. denial of the duty resting upon every Amer- ,
lean to be & good citizen. There is, however, j

Their creed should bind together in generous
co-operation all who are willing to fight to
make our Government what the fathers In
tended it to be â a depository of benefits which,
in equal current and volume, should flow out
to all the people. This creed should teach the
wickedness of attempting to" make free oppor
tunity the occasion for seizing especial ad
vantages, and should warn against the danger
of ruthless rapacity. It should deprecate os
tentation and extravagance in the life of our
people and demand in the management of pub
lic affairs simplicity and strict economy. It
nhould teach toleration In all things, save dis
honesty and Infidelity to public trusts. It
should uphold, the Interests of labor and advo
cate Its fair treatment, but should sternly
forbid its interference with those contented
with their toll and its attempt to force com
pliance with its demands by violent disturb
ances of peace and good order. It should
recognixe in the wide distribution of capital
and industrial enterprise the best assurance of
intelligent, wholesomely interested political
conduct, and should condemn unnecessary, un
natural and speculative combinations in trade
or enterprise as teaching false business lessons
and putting our consumers at their mercy. It
should insist that our finances and currency
concern not alone the large traders, merchants
and bankers of our land, but that they are In
timately and every day related to the well being
of our people in all conditions of life, and that,
therefore. If any adjustments are necessary,
they should be made In such a manner as shall
certainly maintain tho soundness of our people's
earnings and the security of their savings. It
should enjoin respect for the law as the qual
ity that cement3 the fabric of organized so
ciety and makes possible a government by the
people. And in every sentence and every line
of this creed of good citizenship the lesson
should be taught that our country Is a beautiful
and productive field to be cultivated by loyal
Americans, who. with weapons near at hand,
whether they sow and reap or whether they
rest, will always be prepared to resist those
who attempt to despoil by day or pilfer In the
night.
I am by no means unmindful of the extent
to which the American people are In a certain
sense governed by parties, and I am quite will
ing to confess a strong party* allegiance. I
(Â¦peak to-night of something broader and loftier
than party â of a higher law under whose sanc
tion all parties should exist and by whose
decrees all parties should be Judged. . I would
have the mass of our voters po constantly Im
pressed by this law. and 60 Insistent upon Its
observance, as to force upon the managers of
party organizations the necessity and expedi
ency of its recognition. Within the limits of
this law of patriotic American good citizenship
there is abundant room for Intelligent j party
activity; but this activity must be clean and
uncorrupted â sincere in Its Intentions, frank In
the declaration of Its purposes and honest in
th* affairs, of the people.
It Is as cl#ar as noonday that. If the pa
triotism of our people Is to be aggressively
vigorous and equal to. our national preserva
tion and If politics Is to subserve a high pur
pose' Instead, of degenerating to the level of
a cunning game our good men in every walk
of life must arouse themselves to consciousness
that the safety and best interests of their
country Involve every other Interest; and that
by service In the field of good citizenship they
not only do patriotic duty, but in a direct way
save for themselves the share of benefits due
them from our free institutions. If our busi
ness men In their hard struggles for accumu
lation will remember these things and admit
their country's weal to a share m their strug
gles- if our scholar* and educators will not
only teach patriotism but will emerge from
theoretical . contemplation and give proof by
their example that their lessons mean practi
cal care for thsir country; and If in every
way Â¦ possible our people are reminded . of the
value of the government they hold for .them
selves and In trust for their children, and are
stimulated to intelligent activity In. its protec
tion we may confidently look for the condi
tions and results treasured up In a divine pur
pose and prophesied through faith In God at
our nation's birth. â" . . . â '
In the dav when all shadows shall have
passed away and when good citizenship shall
have made sure the safety, permanence and
happiness of our nation, how small will ap
pear the etrifei? of selfishness In our ch-le life,
and how petty will seem , the machinations of,
degraded 'politics! There shall be set over
aeainst them in that. time a reverent sense of
co-oDeration in heaven's plans for our people's
preatness and ' the Joyous . pride jot; standing
among those who In the comradeship of Amer
ican sood citizenship have so protected and de
fended our heritage of , self-government # that

CREED OF GOOD . CITIZENSHIP.
I hasten to give assurance that I have not
ri>oken in a Epirit of gloomy pessimism. I
shall be the last of all our. people to believe
that the savlrtg grace of patriotism among my
countrymen is dead or will always sleep. ' I
know that its timely revival and activity
rm-r.n the realization of the loftiest hopes of a
free nation. I have faith that the awakening
is forthcoming; and on this faith I build a
cheerful hope for the healing of all the wounds
Inflicted in slumber and neglect. Nor do I for
get my surroundings as I speak.- If the city of.
Chicago has had experiences that support my
recital of perils I..do not fail to remember that
it lias also been here demonstrated - in what
manner good citizenship can protect against
them. As In the municipality, so in our na
tion, our weal or woe, is made dependent upon
the disinterested participation, or the neglect, â¢
of good men in public affairs. It is time that
there should be an end of self-satisfied gratifi
cation, or pretense of virtue, in the phrase, "I
am not a politician"; and It Is time to forbid
the prostitution of the word to a sinister use.
Every citizen should be politician enough to
bring himself within the true meaning of the
term, as one who concerns, himself with "the
regulation or government of a nation or State
for the preservation of its safety, peace and
prosperity." This Is politics In Its best sense
and this Is good citizenship.- | |
If good men are to interfere to make politi
cal action what it should be, they must not
suppose they will come upon an open field un
occupied by an opposing force. On the ground
they have neglected they will find a host of
those who engage in politics for personal ends
and selfish purposes, and this ground cannot
be taken without a hand-to-hand conflict. The
attack must be made under the banner of dis
interested good citizenship.^ by soldiers drilled
in lessons of patriotism. They must be enlist
ed for life and constantly on duty. As the
Crusaders fought centuries ago for the recov
ery of the holy land from infidel possession,
so with the same stubborn zeal must to-day's
Crusaders in the cause of good government
fight to recover their holy land from the Inn"
dels who would degrade and defile it.
AWAKENING IS FORTHCOMING.
not politicians, or with silly pretensions of,
faith In our strength and luck have languidly
claimed that the country was prosperous, equal
to any . emergency and proof aguinsi all dan
gers. - -'.... . -; . -Â¦ .: Â¦>'. : ..'
Resulting from these conditions in a man
ner not difficult to trace Â¦ wholesome ' national
sentiment Is threatened with utter perversion.
All sorts of misconceptions pervade the pub
lic thought, and Jealousies rapidly taking on
the complexion of class hatred are found in
every corner of the land. A new meaning
has been , given to national prosperity. With
a hardihood that savors- of. Insolence an. old
pretext, which has preceded the doom of an
cient experiments In popular rule, la dally and
hourly dinned In our ears.-^ "We are told that
the national splendor we have built upon the
showy ventures of speculative wealth Is a
badge of our success. Unsaarlng contentment
is enjoined upon the masses or our people, and
they are invited, in the bare subai stance of
their scanty homes, to patriotically rejoice in
their country's prosperity. This Is too unsub
stantial an enjoyment of benefits to satisfy
those who have been taught American equal
ity: and thus has arisen, by a perfectly
natural process, a dissatisfied insistence upon
a better distribution of the results of .-. our
vaunted Â¦ prosperity. We â¢ now see its worst
manifestation In the apparently Incorrigible
dislocation of the proper relations between
labor and capital. This, of Itself,,. Is suffi
ciently distressing; but thoughtful men are not
without dread of sadder developments yet to
come. There has also grown up among our
people a disregard for the restraints of law,
and a disposition to evade its limitations â
while querulous strictures concerning the ac
tion of our courts tend to undermine popular
faith in the course of Justice: and last, but
by no means least, complaints o' Imaginary
or exaggerated shortcomings In our financial
policies furnish an excuse for the flippant ex
ploitation of all sorts of monetary nostrums.

Captains Cole and NIssen and First
Lieutenant R. C. Foy met at army head
quarters yesterday as a board of inves
tigation to get at the bottoin- of the
charges against Captain H. P. Young,
quartermaster of the, transport Sheridan.
Many enlisted men asserted that they
were not properly, fed, and cared for on
the vessel's last trip from Manila to San
Francisco. The deliberations of the board
were secret. A formal report will be
made to General MacArthur to-day or to
morrow, i ; -v
Board Investigates Charges.
S I No news can be heard in regard to the
whereabouts of the escapeiS or the identi
ty of , their . supposed 'confederate in ,this
city. /Major Morrow; will continue the in
vestigation Â¦ and embody the information
he may discover In a. report to General
MacArthur.?
"It -is Â¦Â¦â¢ generally, supposed that Stokes'
money paid 'the fare of the four plotters
to some point in the Bast and the author
ities, in that section of the country; have
been Â» warned to be on * the lookout. -Â¦
The Investigation ofHheiescape of Fed
eral Prisoners White, Moore,' Stokes and
Darling from Alcatraz a week ago was
commenced by Judge Advocate HÂ»,' W.
Morrow yesterday. He left headquarters
early in the morning and spent the . en
tire day at the prison. Officers, enlisted
men: and prisoners were questioned, re
garding, their knowledge of the affair..
It was learned that the rumor' that the
four prisoners had iwon their way to free
dom by means of forged orders of release
had begun to circulate . shortly after, the
escape.. .No one knew definitely,, whether
the -letterheads had been ; made on the
island. . Major Morrow is /inclined to
think 'that most, of the work was done at
the prison. It is suspected that Moore,

Field said that the opium had been
given to him by a Chinese in Seattle with
instructions to deliver it to another Chi
nese who would be in waiting at the dock
InCthis city. For this service Field re
ceived $10. The drug seized is valued at
5300. The duty would amount to $120.
"They, must have been feeding you on
tin cans," remarked, the inspector. Field's
blouse was then taken off and in the lin
ing of a blue jumper that he wore under
neath ten pounds of the choicest brand
of opium was found in five-tael cans.
Field was at once placed under arrest
on a charge of smuggling. His room on
board the steamer was searched by Cus
toms Inspector ) Henry Gallagher and an
other_ ten pounds' weight of the drug
was found concealed behind a drawer in
a locker. â¢ .
'Twenty pounds of smuggled opium was
found yesterday In possession of Chris
topher Field, boatswain of the steamship
City of . Puebla. which had just arrived
from Victoria. As the steamer swung
into the dock Field jumped off the stern
upon the dock with the nawser and pro
ceeded to fasten It to the top of a pile.
While he was so occupied Customs In
spector J. A. Ross hailed ' him and re
marked that Field had gone rather stout
around the waist since hÂ© had been herÂ©

Joe' Corbett never gave the Cripples a

was great, barring a little wlldness at
times. He made up for this slight defect
by doing some wonderful fielding and by

He did not have to tarry long there, for
Smith | drove a torrid .one out beyond
Kruger. On this lift Wheeler registered.
Kruger t threw the 'ball in, but no one
was backing up the plate, so Smith was
allowed to proceed to third uninterrupted.

The Cripples and the. Angels played ball
yesterday* that, was about the best shown
here in some months. Time and time
again it seemed the strain was too much,
yet the collapse held aloof till the eighth
round. 'Tls a sad tale, * the tale of the
eighth. The Angels did their work well
and. when -the dread period^ had - passed
seven runs were on the boards for them.
Score, 7 to 0.
The perfect weather made good ball
playing easy. Every man who was on the
performing list: seemed keyed up to the
limit. Nothing was too -hot for the field
ers to handle till the collapse came.*' Both
Corbett and young, McKay were pitching
ball that would, have won a man' fame
in any league. :^The youngster was a trifle
better; than his talented rival till the ex
plosion occurred. Then- there was no com
parison. '
Overall, - who had been detained from
the game in the first half, took his old
position In- the' center of the rush . line
when the second, half was called, but de
spite the inspiration of his presence and
the '' effective work of his brawn the col
lege team flighty and . failed ; to
threaten the Reliance goal during the i en
tire half. . - Hudson, y ,' the powerful J little
right^end, gave his right'knee and ankle
such a severe wrench during a scrimmage
that" the physician that three
weeks on crutches would be his j portion,
and that he might be out of the big game.
All through the game yesterday, the col
lege Â¦ men showed glaring faults in j the
very A B , C of football j lore. Snedlgar
made two glaring, fumbles and Mini one.
All: of the line men evinced a painful ten
dency to get offside, a fault which will
be fatal in the bl^ game. The line-up:

OVERALL IN THE GAME.
The game was brilliant in spots. Every
body yelled when Mini, the midget, dashed
through the - Reliance in a mix-up and
sprinted down the field, aided by the clev
er interference , of Belknap, for twenty
five good yards. Again Jim Forse, the big
tackle, butted his way through three Re-"
ltance \ men and covered a like â¢ distance
before' he was downed. Snedlgar and
Overall repeated the feat. ,
In the first half." the onslaughts of the
clubmen were fast and fierce. Twice the
college men failed to make their distance
and had to surrender the ball. Once Mini
was^seized behind; the line and, entirely
unsupported , by his interference, was
pushed back ten yards. Twice the club
men made their distance through the col
lege team. Three times did members of
the blue and gold eleven become over
anxious and suffered the penalty for off
side play. It was only near the end of the
half that the California boys seemed^to
find themselves, and then they rushed the
ball down toward the Reliance goal. With
the spheroid twenty feet away, and half a
minute left' in Which to play, Sam Stow,
left guard, dropped back and: booted a*n
easy field f goal. -
SOME BRILLIANT RUNS.
With the big game only a^month off the
Berkeley adherents_ could only say their
kindest after the game by averring tnat
theiry aggregation of giants was : in a
slump.: When kicks were "fumbled, the
interference tread upon the toes of the
runner and the ends got away outside of
their man a high school boy might have
seen that the blue and gold eleven has
some work coming to them if they expect
to run Stanford off the field next month.
"Overall, Overallâ what's J the matter
with' Overall? 1^ The*" students on the
bleachers went - Into raptures as I the idol
of the California football team took his
place on the field yesterday at the-Â«nd of
the first half : In . the gamÂ© with N ReHance.
Of course, everybody concedes/ there "is
nothing .the matter with Overall, but
some of the wise ones are asking them
selves what Is the matter, with ! the Cali
fornia team - without Overall In tho bal
ance. It Just managed to score -a field
goal yesterday agairist ; the clubmen, and
that was "ell.
It has become painfully patent to , the
Berkeley coaches that the team is Overall
and" Overall is the team. The giant cap
tain does all the kicking; he is^the bul
wark of 'the line; he is thehardest man
to^bring to earth when he has the ball
tucked Â¦, under his arm. Without : Overall
in his Â¦ place at right guard the Berkeley
rooters would not be going about j with
money in: their hands ."-offering to take
three to one on ttie outcome of the match
with Stanford.

are the same in each.
The price for a double berth 13 only j
$5 to Omaha or Kansas City, $6 to
Chicago or St. Louis, and $8 to Boston.
Less than half the palace car price.

A Â«light change appears in Sheepskins and
there U Vic decline In Buckskins. Tallow is
also quoted somewhat lower. Hops rule easy
at the decline menttonad, and the demand at
the moment Is slack.
A local house says of Wool: "An unac
countable dullness has developed In the Wool
market and in the absence of any wholesale
trading the prevailing prices are purely nom
inal. The Marysville sales held last Saturday
were extremely disappointing to growers, who
were forced to accept from SfrlCc a pound for
thÂ»lr stock, although they had expected Â«r
least 1012120. the same rates that were ob
tained at the* recent Red Bluff sales. A quiet
tone Is also prevailing In the Eastern centers."
In connection with the current weakness In
Hops advices from New York say: -'A point
is being made by some of the trade that with
Hops at their present cost, the question of
finance Is an important one with many d*Â»alerÂ«.
It taking a large outlay of money to handle
any considerable quantity of HorÂ«. and the
condition of money makes It necessary to pay
high rates of Interest to obtain funds."

Dried Fruits,Nuts, Raisins, Honey
Bran and Middlings rule firm at the recent
advance, with llsht offerings.
Hay rules weak, owing to the recent large
receipts, and Alfalfa la. beinc sold lower by
some dealers.
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"During the latter part of last week receipts
of Hay were very light, but this week has
opened with rather heavy shipments again.
The total for the week ending to-day amounts
to 32C0 tons, an Increase over the week pre
ceding of 700 tons. Shipments by water have
been quite heavy the past few days, but witn
the exception of Monday's record shipments by
rail have been quite light. Quite a portion of
the water shipments have been Alfalfa. Most
of the Grain Hay coming by boat wa3 shipped
from Stockton, which district alone has quite
a bit of Hay out of doom. What is arriving by
caru has been taken from the warehouses, and
owing to the expense of storag<rand Insurance
very little profit has been realized on the sale
of same, even with the recent advance in prices.
Because of Monday's heavy arrivals there was
a decided weakening In prices, although very
few sitlea were made.
The general tendency of the market will be
toward higher prices, for as practically all the
Hay is In second hands there will be a natural
effort to make some profit on what has been
purchased. The market will probably be a
very sensitive one, however, and prices will be
weak whenever a slngls day's arrivals are very
heavy.
"Choice Wheat Hay hold* its own better
than the other grades, for there Is a certain
daily demand for this kind of Hay. and as a
rule very light stocks of the choicest Hay aro
carried by the various dealer*. Although at
the present writlns the situation is a bit
weak, yet we can quote no change from the
prices elven last week."

CHICAGO. Oct. 14. â There was a general dis
position manifested among wheat traders to sell
out long lines and with an absence of any
news that might be construed as of a bullion
character the market developed a weak under
tone. Opening prices were easier on rather
Indifferent cables, favorable weather for the
movement and larger receipts. December being
'Â«@VÂ«c lower at 79 t i,@79V4c. Trading was dull
in the early part of, the session and prices fluc
tuated within a narrow range. The tendency
w&s toward a lower level, though. Influenced by
the smaller demand for cash and lower prices
in Minneapolis. Later a fair rally occurred on
buying by traders who had sold short early,
which sent December up gradually to 79V4c. A
slight rally at Minneapolis and a stronger mar
ket at St. Louis were causes for the covering.
During the last hour of the session there was
selling on the advance credited to a prominent
bull operator and with an absence of support
the market again weakened. Closing prices
were near the bottom, with December V$c lower
at 78 T ,iC. after touching 7S*;e78%c.
Corn got a firm start under the Influence
imparted from yesterday's shipping business
and on higher cables and on much smaller re
ceipts than had been estimated. There was a
fair demand from locals early in the day, and
with light offerings the market developed addi
tional strength, helped to some extent by the
small offerings from the country. The late
weakness in wheat affected corn and the close
was only a trifle higher than yesterday, De
cember being up 'ic at 35=4c, after selling be
tween 45 1 -i4i45iic.
Trading in oats was of moderate proportions
and prices held about steady. Buying waj
mainly by one or two commission houses and
local shorts, while the selling was scattered.
The firmness in corn and light offerings were
early bull factors, but later the market eased
off with other grains. After selling between
37Viii37iic, December closed He lower at 37Uc
An improved cash demand with better prices
for hegs at the yards caused firmness In pro
visions early In the day. but aside from some
buying for foreign accounts the demand was
limited and as the session advanced the market
became easier. Selling by packers was a weak
ening influence late in the day. The close was
steady, with January pork and lard each 2 Vic
lov.-er. while ribs were down 2V4'85c.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Changes in Citrus and Tropical fruits werÂ»
Might. Ripe Bananas were still scarce and
continued to bring good prices. The steamer
Alameda brought up about 2500 bunches oi
green stock.
The fruit market was liberally supplied with
Apples and Grapes, but receipts of all other
kinds were light. The local demand was light
and confined to a few descriptions and aside
from a fair Inquiry for fine Apples for shipment
to Honolulu there was not much doing In the
shipping line. Ths top quotation for Apples
was obtained only for occasional lots of Splti
enberg or the King variety. ?1 being an ex
treme figure ior all other varieties. Grape* In
crates were offering freely and were easy owing
to the lack of demand for shipping. Receipts
of large open boxes were suddenly large and
rtock had to be strictly fancy to bring the top
quotation, which was obtained only for the
Muscat variety. Tckay and Black sold 'from
75c to 00c per tf)x. There /ifw a good demand
for Nutmeg Melons and prices ranged higher.
Fine large Watermelons, too, were higher, but
thÂ» market was overloaded with poor stock.
which could not be sold at any figure. There
were no Peaches received. The season for that
fruit Is practically over. Flira were in freÂ»
supply and moved slowly, the previous high
prices having checked the demand. The other
orchard fruits stood as previously quoted.
Raspberries and Strawberries were in limited
supply during the early trade and prices were
firmer. The bulk of tho day's receipts did not
comÂ« to hand until a late hour and had to be
held over 'for to-day's market. The market
was bare of Huckleberries.
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
WHEAT â The foreign markets remain about
the Fame.
Chicago was> some fractions lower. The do

cables were disappointing.
In this market futures were higher, but the
cash grain showed no material change.

A .stranger was found hanging from
the limb of a tree yesterday morning in
Golden Gate Park. The police connected
with the Park Station had been searching
Cor the dead man during the greater
part of the night, and found it at
half past 5 o'clock in the morning.
It was the body of an unidentified man.
tvho had evidently committed suicide by
hanging himself to a tree on the grounds
ot the old '40 mining camp, oposite Thir
teenth avenue.
The strangest thing connected with the
iffair is the fact that the suicide, or
iome person'who had discovered the body,
railed up the Park Police Station by tele
)hone last Tuesday night and informed
he officer on watch that a man had
mnged himself In the park. He then
looked up the telephone receiver, before
le could be asked as to the exact location
>f the body. The police, however, made
i search and discovered the corpse jast
ibout daybreak. It was that of^ a man
ibout 35 years old, five feet eight inches
all, with black hair, light mustache, light
lorr.plexion, gray eyes, light eyebrows
ind pointed nose and chin. The body was
Iressed in a black coat and vest,* black
lerby hat, black laced shoes and steel
ffay trotisers. In the pockets were found
i nickel cigar puncher and a bunch of
hree desk keys, the smallest one marked
178," and a thin latch key. A pocket mlr

The local branch of the Mint has about
$50,000,000 worth of gold bars on hand, be
sides about half a million dollars in silver
for- subsidiary coinage, so that the regular
employes will have plenty of work '. for
several months to come. By that time
Superintendent Leach expects that i the
Treasury officials will be ready to resume
the coinage of Philippine pesos.
The cost of 'coining 2,000,000 pesos was
$50,000 more in September than in August.
From two to four million ounces of silver
are used at the Mint monthly and hence
the recent increase of 11 cents an ounce
In cost is' a matter of considerable im
portance from a financial standpoint.
Last April when the coinage began Su
perintendent Leach found that he^needed
to Increase his force of employes. Appli
cants for positions were examined in
July, but the papers were \ not marked
until a few days ago. Those at thothead
of the eligible list received appointments
and have just commenced to work. About
fifty.men and women will lose their posi
tions. Many -of those affected left good
places to work at the Mint and" will un
doubtedly feel the misfortune keenly.
If the price of silver should advance 5
cents more an ounce the pesos would be
worth more than their face value as bul
lion and would probably be melted before
they could be put into general circulation.
The Washington authorities probably
realized that Government purchases of
silver had much to do with the advance
and decided therefore to curtail the coin
age. - . â¢ Â¦:.; .-..- â¢
ThÂ© recent rapid advance In the price
of sliver has led. the Treasury! authori
ties in Washington to Issue orders sus
pending the coinage of Philippine pesos
at the local branch of the Mint. This
means that there will be a reduction' of
the force of employes and that many new
hands just appointed from the civil ser
vice eligible list will be thrown out of
work.

Bartholdy told the engravers and Agent
Hazen that he had been sent to this city
by mininjr men in Arizona to have the
work done and that he did not know that
he was engaged in doing anything wrong.
When pressed for the names of his em
ployers he said that he could not remem
ber their names. A charge of conspiracy
to counterfeit will be placed against him.
In the year 1900 Bartholdy wrote to an
engraving firm in Los Angeles ordering it
to copy a 10-gulden note and offering to
pay $500 for the reproductions, which he
said he wished to use as labels.
The arrested man says he owns or, has.
an interest in a hotel at Prescott, Ariz.-
Hazen relieved the prisoner of the weight
Of a 45-caliber revolver and a bowie knife.
' "pon't stop! me!" cried Bartholdy fran
tically. "Don't you see that I'll miss my

, "You'll miss it all right," -was the dry
response of the, secret service man as he
took his prisoner by the arm.
Bartholdy-' came to this city a few days
ago, representing himself to be a mining
man and carrying with him several cer
tificates of stock in mining and other cor
porations. He v visited several engraving
and lithographing establishments in :,this
city to make terms for the printing of*4000
mining stock ' certificates with the ', bank
note in the center, the whole to be printed
upon bond paper of the same quality and
appearance of that on which the bank
notes had been printed. Ellis & Co., litho
graphers, secured the contract and went
to the firm of Roesch & Co. to inquire as
to some detail of the work and' were in
formed there that the- document in the
German language which was T to be copied
in the center of the j certificates was a
bank note and that its duplication would
be counterfeiting. Ellis & Co. thereupon

The grand orator, E. H. Hart, deliv
ered an address on the unselfish motive
which had prompted Mr. Siminoff to make
the gift of the building to the : fraternity,
and he was followed by Major Sherman.
The grand master, addressing himself
to the speaker and to Mr. Siminoff. said
that he would with pleasure dedicate the
new building as requested and expressed
the appreciation of the fraternity in the
State for Mr. Siminpff's practical and
beautiful gift. The ceremonies of dedi
cation were then gone through with.- Â»
The grand master then Introduced the
donor of the building, who" was received
with applause. Mr. Siminoff delivered a
modest, short speech. In which he stated
that he had been. prompted'. to make the
donation because he believed that in so
doing he could do something that would
benefit the Masons of this. State for years
to cone. He presented to the grand mas
ter r. magnificent Jewel consisting of the
square and compass, with a diamond at
the head of the compass, all within a
square of gold. " , '
Those in the Pullman coaches were. on
the way served light refreshments under
the supervision of a committee composed
of Captain General B. N. Rowley,. Senior
Warden Otto-F. Westphal and "junior
Warden RalDh L.. Hajhorn. ,
The ceremony of dedication took | place
on the steps of the new edifice,' which
stands "in the rear and to the risrht" of
the main building. After the grand offi
cers had been escorted to -the places re
served for them, Samuel D. Mayer, grand
organist, and' the Masonic choir of the
Grand Lodge rendered an anthem, after
which Grand Master O. S. Henderson
briefly- stated the object of the assem
blage of Masons and friends. Past Grand
Master C. L. Patton, chairman of the
trustees of the home; then asked the
grand master to dedicate the new build
ing in the name of Masonry, according
to ancient usages, for the purpose of Ma
sonry. Â¦
The Slmlnoff Temple > at the Masonic
Home, Decoto, was dedicated "yesterday
afternoon in the presence of 2000 people.
In the forenoon immediately after the
Grand Lodinsyiad been called off, after
a brief session in this city,' there^was
formed in front of the Masonic Temple
on Post street v a procession of the several
Masonic bodies, which, escorted by a pla
toon of mounted police, moved in the
following order to the Oakland ferry land-_
Ing under the grand marshalship of John'
Tonningsen:
The jrrand marshal, ChiÂ«f Aid Filmer and
other aids; California Commandery No. 1,
Knights Templar, mounted on black chargers,
each wearing the magnificent Templar uniform
and each horse beintj Kayly caparisoned; Ben
nett's Band; San Francisco ChaDter of the
Scottish Rite, escorting the donor of the tem
ple; 400 members of the blue lodges of this
city; the Masonic Home Boys' Band; dismount
ed mecibers of California Commandery, acting
as escort to the grand master and other offi
cers of the Grand Lodce of California and
members of the Grand Lodge.
ThÂ»re were about 750 members of the
fraternity in line. The officers of the
Grand Lodge were the guests of the Cali
fornia Commandery, Knights Templar,
and at the Oakland mole _were assigned
to one . of a special train"" of Pullman
coaches secured for the commandery. All
others went by specials of ordinary day
coaches. There were fully as many la
dles on the trains as there were gentle
men. On the way to destination the day
coach specials took up delegations of the
fraternity at Oakland and other points,
which added materially to the number of
excursionists.
â¢ The committee postponed further con
sideration until next Wednesday at 3:30
p. m.
Ben 'Stern of the Humane Society pro
duced two regular receiejs for released
dogs of which he said there was no.rec
ord. ". .
H. D. Dents testified that on April 11
twenty-five head of cattle were impound
ed and nothing of the transaction ap
peared on Irwin's sworn statement - for.
April. Irwin explained "that he was di
rected to take the cattle out of a field
by the owner thereof and no fees were
collected for the release of the cattle.
Irwin said he had released dogs without
collecting fees on orders from the Mayor's
office from various persons and from A.
Ruef. ; ~ :--:':..' iV V . .
Gunzendorfer produced figures to show
that j Irwin had - caused the collection, of
$10,000 in dog licenses during his term of
one year, against $8991 during one year of
ex-Poundmaster Lawton's term, and
Irwin's administration had been free
from scandal. r : i; : -
Brandenstein said it cost the city $3400
for Irwin to run the pound for one year
and the board had the right to let the
management out by public contract, either
to the Pacific Humane Society or the San
Francisco Society for Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, each of which offered
to run the pound. -
John Partridge, president | of the last
named society, stated that Mayor Schmitz
had agreed to appoint a representative of
the society as poundmaster, but that
when Its man presented himself with his
official bond he was informed that another
man had been appointed to the place.
"The building used for a pujblic^pound,".
said Partridge, "is a disgrace. to the city
and should receive the attention of the
Board of Health. We, lost the manage
ment of the institution after twelve years
and after we had been complimented by
Mayor Schmitz. Our pound is located at
Sixteenth and Alabama 'streets and cost
us $27,000, and we are ready to carry out
our former agreement with the city."
Frank J. -Kane of the Pacific Humane
Society said his concern 1 would run the
pound if the city would appropriate $900
per month for the purpose. He charged
the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals with making $7000 In one year,
but this Partridge denied.
Irwin said no "horseback" men were
now employed, because the appropriation
had been decreased, and therefore-roam
ing cattle or horses were not being im
pounded. Irwin promised to submit, an
itemized statement of the expenses of his
office.
Â¦ Brandenstein said the Board of Super
visors had the power, of ap
pointment to the Mayor, and It could
take it away from him if it saw fit to do
so for economical reasons.
Attorney Gunzendorfer, representing:
Irwin, stated that he desired to protest
formally against any action contemplating
the taking away of Irwin' s position, be
cause he had been appointed by the Mayor
under an ordinance giving his Honor-au
thority to appoint a poundmaster. Gun
zendorfer said no charges have been filed
against Irwin.
The Joint committee on finance, license*
and police met yesterday to . consider
further the proposal to take the manage
ment of the public pound away from JI.
