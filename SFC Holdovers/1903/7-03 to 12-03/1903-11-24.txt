Three of His Comrades.
There were twenty men all told aboard the French bark Francois Coppee when she struck on
a small rock at the entrance to Bodega Bay, about eleven miles north of Point Reyes lighthouse, last
Friday night. Seven of them perished and the tales told by the thirteen survivors find few. equals in
the great register of marine horrors. ' .
Four of the seamen â First Officer. Edward Nol ere, 7 August -Victor, Adolph; Victor and P.
O'Neilâ arrived in this city yesterday afternoph. There -is no conflicting 'statements in their stories
of the wreck. They say that the bark was buffeted about for days while'trying to' reach this .port, and
that for forty-eight hours prior to her loss she was unable. to get bearings or soundings, so dense was
the fog and so raging the sea. When sliej struck the rock \the;, murk was so thick that the bewildered
crew could see only a few feet away, and Captain ''Inrye-and his officers did not know what part.of

Of course they drank and in their
drunken condition began to search for
more liquor. In the cargo were some
carboys of carbolic acid, and in their
drunken frenzy the sailors broke into
them. The first two to drink of thl3
poison were the two with whom the
sailmaker had . had trouble. . and the
third is said to have been an innocent
youth who had signed for the voyago
only, for the purpose of reaching Cali
fornia. According to the captain's
story the first officer, who had profited
by the* former raid upon the cargo, was
on Watch, and missing the members of
the crew, he went to the hold and there
Three weeks ago Captain Breckwoldt
discovered a number of the members of
his crew, including his first officer, in
toxicated. Investigation showed that
with the knowledge of this first officer
the sailmaker had led several members
of the crew into the sealed hold and
there they had broken into casks con
taining whisky, a part of which they
carried to the first officer and to other
members of the crew. This breach of
discipline was duly punished by the
captain and for several days the inci
dent was forgotten, but within a week
the sailmaker, taking the lead of other
members of the crew, among them the
two with whom he had had trouble,
again entered the hold and showed the
sailors where the liquor was to be
found.
FIRST MATE INTOXICATED.
It was a srewsome story which the
captain told; a story of fights, revenge
and death, and it will be for the Ger
man authorities to pass upon the guilt
or innocence of the accused. Names
are lacking for the present, for the
reason that the captain has not official
ly entered a United States port. HÂ»
has anchored off Port Los Angeles, but
has declared himself as still being un
der German jurisdiction and will re
main so until he can communicate by
wire with those in authority, under
whose orders and control he, considers
himself. Meantime the one prisoner
aboard the Octavia will remain in
irons, charged with murder, and it will
be for the Consul at San Francisco to
decide what course shall be pursued.
On July G the- Octavia sailed from
Antwerp laden with railroad Iron,
cement and a general cargo, bound for
Port Los Angeles and San Francisco.
She is a fast sailer and until after she
rounded the Horn the voyage wai
without incident except for the usual
fights which occur among sailors on
such a voyage, ilore than one of these
fights had been between two certain
members of the crew and the sail
maker, in which the latter was badly
whipped, and after which he is said
to have threatened revenge.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23.â With her
sailmaker in irons, charged with a
diabolical murder, her first officer sick
unto death and her logbook showing
that three poisoned members of her
crew had been buried at sea. the Ger
man ship Octavia, Captain Breckwoldt,
140 days from Antwerp, dropped anchor
oft Port Los Angeles this afternoon.
The first thing that the captain re
ported when his barge touched the Ions
wharf and he was met by a customs
officer was that. murder had been com
mitted on his ship and he wanted to
know what could be done about it. Hla
next inquiry was as to a hospital to
which he could send his ftr3t officer,
and that being told him. the sick man
about whom he was so solicitous was
conveyed to this city and taken to the
Slstera* Hospital, where he lies hover
ing between life and death.

ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 23. â A
seml-cfficial Russian agency has re
ceived from Tokio a report to the ef
fect that Japanese warships have been
dispatched to prevent the Russian war
vessels Tsarevitch and Baiar. reaching
Port Arthur to join the Russian squad
run there.
The report that the Japanese have
occupied Wiju. on the Ya!u River, is
not confirmed here, and is not given
credence.
LONDON, Nov. 24.â The papers this
morning publish disquieting rumors of
the situation in the Far East. These
reports eeem to gather certain signi
ficance from the absence of any re
liable authoritative statements con
cerning the actual situation.
In addition to a St. Petersburg ru
mor that Japanese warships have been
sent to intercept two Russian vessels
bound for Port Arthur, there is a re
port from Moscow which says the be
lief is growing that hostilities between
Russia and Japan have actually begun.
UOT CONFIRMED IN LONDON.
This alarming report cannot be con
firmed here. It is possible that it
originated with the statement of the
Japanese journal, the Nagasaki Shim
po, which, as announced in these dis
patches yesterday, was to the effect
that a Japanese squadron of twelve
vessels had left Sasebo for au unknown
destination.
The fact that such a statement shouid
be issued by a Russian semi-official
agency is. however, regarded as signifi
cant. Curiously enough, the Rugsian
newspaper Wret a few days ago ex
pressed the belief that communication
between Port Arthur and Japan had
been already interrupted.
In Cardiff yesterday renewed activ
ity was reported on the part of the
Russian and Japanese agents with a
view to securing further shipments of
coai.
Russia is described as showing the
signs of nervous tension and extreme
depression which frequently precede
the moment of decisive action in na
tional crises.
DE BOSEN'S SUDDEN ACTIVITY.
The Tokio correspondent of the Daily
Mail represents the situation in un un
satisfactory light. He says ft is re
ported that Baron de Rosen, the Rus
sian Minister, received a long and urg
ent telegram from St. Petersburg,
whereupon he sent for Baron Komura,
th* Japanese Minister of Foreign Af
fairs.
According. to the same correspondent
M. Pavloff, the Russian Minister at
Seoul, has sent another note to the
Korean Government regarding Yon
gamphn, declarins that if Korea per
sists Is opening that port Russia will
take action. Korea replied that Rus
sia's interference with the opening of
Yongampho was a violation of Korea's
sovereign rights, to which she_strongly
objected. Korea concurrently notified
the~Japanese Minister to the same ef
fect.

BUENOS AYRES, Argentine, Nov. 23.
Lieutenant Josem Sobral of the Argen
tine navy, who accompanied the Nor
denskjold Antarctic expedition, has tel
egraphed to La Prensa, from Santa
Cruz, some of the particulars of the
work of the expedition and the loss of
Its ship, the Antarctic. Lieutenant So
bral says the Antarctic attempted to
go to the east of Joinvllle Island, but
met many difficulties. The ship finally
entered the gulf of Erebus arid Terror,
where she was crushed by the ice and
sunk.
This occurred on February 3 of the
present year. Captain Larsen and all
of the members of the party escaped
and succeeded In saving some of the
provisions before the ship went down.
They started for Paulet Island and for
sixteen days they had to pass through
many difficulties, but all reached the
island in good condition. They spent
the winter on Paulet Island, subsisting
on seals.
The Argentine gunboat Uruguay ar
rived at the island on November 18 and
took on board Captain Larfen and
twenty-eight members of the expedi
tion. The gunboat then returned to
Louis Philippe Land, wherÂ«j it took
aboard several boxes containing fossils
collected by the expedition.
The Nordenskjold party explored
Grahams Land, between Bramfleld
Strait and Cape Pramaes, <ts well as

r\ETAlLS of the wreck of the French bark Francois Coppee at Pierces Point, eleven miles north of Point Reyes, last Friday night, were brought to this city yesterday by four of the men who were saved by swimming ashore after
J^y the small boat in which they had left the doomed vessel was smashed to splinters on the rocks. These four men, with ijik nine that -were picked up by the steam schooner Scotia and taken to Bozvens Landing, make the total
number of saved thirteen. An unconfirmed report from Point Reyes is to the effect that tcvo more of the. crew had succeeded in reaching shore and ivere seen zvalking in the direction of the lighthouse. There zverc twenty
souls aboard the bark when she struck, and Captain Inrye is among the missing. He was in the lifeboat that foundered, and when last seen' he was clinging to a table that- had floated from the ztreckagc. First Officer Edward No-
Icre was among the four that succeeded in reaching the slwre, and in an interview zvith The Call he tells a terrible story of the suffering which he and his companions underwent from the time they left the ship until they reached the
mainland and obtained succor. All of the survivors pronounce as ridiculous the report that there was mutiny, or even dissatisfaction, among the crew, and the seamen unite in declaring that Captain Inrye zvas a gallant sailor and
a humane officer. They say he zvas last to leave the vessel as she was pounding to pieces on the rocks. Two bod[cs were seen in the surf at the Point Reyes lighthouse last evening, and two more zvere zvashed ashore at Bodega Bay.
Coasters that arrived here \cstcrday saw no zvreckage off the Marin or Sonoma shore, and little debris from the wreck has been reported by the men who are patrolling the coast. It is beliez'ed that the bark has broken to pieces.

Somehow or another they all laughed
in the wrong place at the Alcazar last
night â and it worried James Durkln,
who wÂ»s essaying the difficult role of
Noah Vale in "The Poor Relation." To
tell the truth, an Alcazar audience is
not the best one, maybe, to appreciate
one of those plays where the tears and
the smiles have such a narrow frontier.
They might have laughed had Sol Smith
Russell Â¦ been the poor, hunger-ridden
inventor.
That good old play, "The Poor Rela
tion," has not been with* us for so long
that it is a pleasure to see it. Such
sweet plays are not written very often
nowadays. The part of Noah is a hard
one and Mr. Durkin makes a worthy
attempt at it. Just a little short of
what it ought to be . is his rendition,
however. There is not enough by-play
to fill in the pauses. .The quaint humor
strikes the audience 'like an end man's
joke. in a. minstrel show and not as the
foil to the pathos which lie so near the
surface. It is not convincing.
,But Miss Frances Starr as Scollops is
the attraction of the piece. Who would
believethe dainty little" Miss Starr, who
does the sweet young thing parts in the

But she does, and the whole house is
with her. Miss Block has only to walk
through her -part, as Â«- Dolly; there is
nothing else to do.- Nor does Miss Howe

The manufacturers made an informal
proposal to supply cement to the Gov
ernment at $9 50 a barrel, the amount
required being 200,000 barrels. The Sec
retary was not satisfied with the price,
and caused an investigation to be made
of the possibility of manufacturing
cement near the site of the proposed
irrigation works.
It was found that good cement could
be made not far from the reservoir
site for $2 50 a barrel. The cement man
ufacturers have protested that v their
informal proposal was not to be re
garded as a bid, and they declare the
Government has no moral right to go
into the cement business and thus
compete with private interests. Hitch
cock has promised to give the cement
men a hearing.
Interior Department officials figure
that it would cost about $3 a barrel to
transport the cement from the nearest
railroad station over the high moun
tains to the reservoir site. It Is be
lieved, therefore, that while the private
manufacturers have named an exor
bitant price, they would not be able in
any event to overcome the natural ad
vantage which the Government would
have by making its own cement near
the place where it is to be used.
It is estimated that the saving to the
Government would amount' to more
than $1,000,000.

bine of cement manufacturers in re

Last night's programme could not
have- been better, chosen. All of the
artists save Agostinl took part. And
they sang. for all they were, worth, for
Maestro Verdi, for the place and people
they have learned '"Â¦. to like and for the
sheer fun of it. They began with the
"Ballo in . Maschera" overture and then
came the second act , of "II Barbiere,"
given with irresistible-fun by Tromben,
who was in better voice* than I 'have
ever heard her; Gregoretti.the splendid,
Travagllnl, -Tedeschi and â¢ Cortesi. The
second number} wns. the : third act r. of
"Zaza,'"in.:which;DeSpada sang: with
fine sympathy. Then came Marcheslni
In a scene from "Aida," with' Dado and
chorus. Both were in fine form. Bene
detto was heard in, the ."Ave:7 Maria"
and "Canzone del Salice" from "Otello,"
Most fittingly the "little opera-house
'round the corner" closed its long and
honorable career last night with a
grand farewell performance in aid of
the Verdi monument fund. The
requiem was worthy of the occasion,
and the house seemed large enough to
insure the sprinklfng of the town with
monuments. Up to the Queer .little
cubbyholc-B in the ceiling there wasn't
a spot big enough to hold even a tailor,
and the enthusiasm was there â¢ to
match. But it wasn't all joy last night.
There was a tear near and a queer
little catch in the throat as one looked
one's last on the old place. The funny
old red and green of it got all blurred
up and the lights shimmered in the
oddest fashion. Twenty-five years ago
they began to gleam â on September 15,
1878. They shone then on the Vienna
Ladies' Orchestra, the first of the
Tivoli attractions. They shone then
also on a main floor covered with small,
round tables, where one took frank
furters with one's Strauss. Last night
the Tivoli lights looked down upon the
performance of an opera, latest of the
most modern Italian school, and the
first production of the work in all
America! All honor to the Tivoli!
There is a long stretch between that
opening night in '78 and to-day. The
unpretentious little place has echoed
to the tune of symphony, grand opera,
comic opera, band stuff. Fourteen
nights only since its opening has the
house been closed. Famous people
have lent their fame to the TivoliâVili
ani, Zlpelli, Natali, Montaldo, Bianchi,
Bulalza, Parolini, Mascagni, Neilsen,
Zelie de Lussan, Salassa, Gustave Hin
richs, Edward MacDo wellâ the listf is
endless. Without any preaching the
little place has lived very nearly to the
"art for art's sake" gospel. They have
done more there for local music s than
any dozen other institutions the town
possesses. And this has been recos:
nized. There is a good deal of affec
tion and gratitude going the Tivoll's
way. People have liked to go there,
have liked the management that has
given them so much for their money,
have given the artists there a great
deal of personal affection. Every one
feels somehow as if they owned the
house, and loved it.. One can wish no
better to the Tivoli of the future,
whose Greek outlines are fast gathering
into shape not far, from the old stamp
ing ground, than just the place that the
old Tivoli 'now holds in the hearts of
the San Francisco music lovers.
About- this time Harriman was also
in possession of information to the ef
fect that antagonistic interests were at
work with a view of connecting Sac
ramento and Stockton by an electric
system, and he suggested to Hunting
ton that the welfare of the Southern
Pacific Company, in which Huntington
is a large shareholder, would be seri
ously affected if the plans of this rival
line carried. The Southern Pacific
Company, it was explained, would have
a valuable advantage if it' could ac
quire control of. the electric line oper
ating inside of the city limits of Stock
ton, and a deal was finally struck
wherein the obliging Huntington
agreed to transfer to Harriman his
block of stock in the Stockton road.
While Attorney Herrin was completing
this transfer Harriman's surveyors
were engaged in -mapping out a route
between the two cities, and when this
work had been quietly accomplished a
company was incorporated to Duild the
road in the event of Harriman deem
ing the. move necessary In the future.
What consideration Huntington re
ceived for his block of stock is, of
course, a secret. . .
A. A. Robinson of. St. Louis, presi
dent of the Mexican Central Railway,
arrived yesterday in a private car on
his way to the City of Mexico, which
he is in the habit of visiting several
times a year. President Robinson is
regarded as one of the most practical
railroad men in the country, a fact of
which the moneyed interests behind the
Southern Pacific and Union Pacific
companies : showed their appreciation
several years ago, when they offered
him the presidency of the former road.
The offer,- however, was declined on
the ground that Mr. Robinson .pre
ferred to remain with the Mexican
Central, which to-day stands as a
monument to his successful manage
ment of its affairs.
As a result of negotiations pending
for several months between E. H. Har
riman, president of the Southern Pa
cific Company and Vice President
Henry "E. Huntington, the large block
of stock of Stockton's street railway
company owned by the latter has
passed tato the hands of the head of
the Southern Pacific. The transfer was
effected recently, during a visit to Los
Angeles of W. F. Herrin, chief coun
sel* of the railroad company, and the
stock is now In his possession, await
ing an order from his superior officer.
Since the recent row with Hunting
ton over the latter's attempt to en
croach on the Southern Pacific Com
pany's freight territory with electric
railway systems, Harriman has taken
a strong liking to this new method of
railroading, and has arrived at the con
clusion that electric feeders to a steam
line are well worth owning. When the
two magnates finally effected a settle
ment of their differences In the south
ern part of the State and agreed to di
vide up among themselves and Senator
Clark the Huntington-Hellman syn
dicate Interests in that section, Harri
man quietly reminded Huntington that
he was aware of the fact that his vice
president was designing to gridiron
Northern California with electric roads,
as he had done in the south, and that
eventually these new lines would be
menacing the Southern Pacific traffic
north of San Francisco.

The Central Theater has the "real
thing" in melodramatic comedy this
week, its attraction, "Midnight in
Chinatown," answering every require
ment in plot, scenes and characters.
Rainy weather could not keep the peo
ple away, and the big audience en
joyed itself in the good old popular
price manner, demanding curtain calls,
and then bringing the actors out one
by one, so as to get the opportunity
of cheering the hero all by himself and
of emphatically expressing their hatred
of the villain by hoots and hisses. One
of the acts contains a suggestion of
the famous Barbary Coast, and an
other has a Chinese opium den, fitted
out in gorgeous style, and exhibiting
every facility for "hitting the pipe."
Throughout the play there is a surfeit
of blood and thunder and property pis
tols gleam sensationally at every cli
max. The villain of the piece is heart
less and conscienceless, but he seems
to lead a charmed existence the while
he is piling up his record of crime, until
he runs up against all his enemies in
a bunch supported by a squad of po
lice, and the time and the nlace chosen
by the author of the drama for this
consummation is "midnight in China
town." The bad man has lured the
heroine to the opium joint and is just
in the act of gloating over his prey
when the house is â¢ raided and he is
dealt with summarily, to the accom
paniment of tremendous applause. TJhe
company does its level best. "Midnight
in Chinatown" is a howling success and
it will undoubtedly draw well all this
week. A special matinee is to be given
on Thanksgiving day.

POINT REYES, Nov. 23. â Buffetted
about for days amidst a seething sea
and unable to get soundings or bear
ings for over forty-eight hours, the
French bark Francois Coppee finally
found a resting place on the rugged
coast between ten and fifteen miles
north of Point Reyes lighthouse. Out
of a crew of twenty, thirteen alone re
main to tell the tale of hardship, pri
vation and extreme suffering from ex
posure. All hands- left the ship in two
lifeboats and nine in one boat managed
to reach land, safe from the fury of the
waves, and were ultimately rescued by
the sch'ooner Scotia and landed safely
and she was also at her best. The num
ber of the programme was, however,
the duet from "Puritani," done by Dado
and Zanini. The indispensable basso
sang gloriously and Zanini showed up
in a surprising way. Then and last
came the fourth act of "Rigoletto,"
with Master Russo, Borghese, Tromben,
Travagllnl and Marchesinl. And, hum
ming the "Donna e Mobile," the last
audience of the old Tlvoll filed down
the well-worn steps. The king is dead

BARK BUFFETTED FOR DAYS.

Soundings Ere She Struck.
SING REQUIEM
OF OLD TIVOLI
Officer Nolere and his three compan
ions deny most strenuously the report
that there was insubordination aboard
the Coppee. They say that officers and
men always worked with the utmost
harmony and that during the terrible
week preceding the wreck, when hard
situation and sounding the well, Cap
tain Inrye told the men that they would
have time to provision the boats and
get away rafely.x and in each of the
small crafts was placed provisions and
water sufficient to last a dozen men
several days without stinting them.
"For one boat the captain told off
Seamen Fred Olsen, Samuel Rays, Ed
ward Anderson, W. Taylor, Jean Con
vilk, Niel Louis, Fred Breken and C.
Augustusâ nine in all. When the boat
was safely launched Captain Inrye or
dered those left on board to leave the
ship on the remaining boat. Only eight
of us succeeded in getting safely away
In herâ Captain InryeJ six sailors and
myself. It was about 6 o'clock a. m.
when we shoved off, and the other boat
was nowhere to be seen. Before we
were out of sight of the bark she, was
breaking up on the jagged rock.
"Our boat was buffetted about most
fearfully. We could not get it away
from the reef on account of the heavy
sea, and finally a huge breaker bore it
upon a rock and it was dashed to
pieces. Â¦ I swam blindly, almost smoth
ered by the flying spume and hardly
knowing where I was being Carried un
til I found myself ashore, so exhausted
and chilled that I was unable to stand.
After a little while I managed to stag
ger to my feet and look around and in
the murky fog I could see that three
others of the boat's crew had reached
the shore. They were in as pitiable a
condition as myself.'
"We could. see sufficient of our sur
roundings to feel confident that we
were not upon the mainland, but upon
a sort "of sharp promontory^ and we
subsequently discovered that we had
been washed ashore at Pierces Point
Across the bay we could see the head
lands loom up and we decided to build
a raft and attempt the passage. While
we were at work on the raft a huge
breaker rolled the corpse of one of our
late shipmates ashore and soon after
ward we saw Captain Inrye floating
on a ship's door, but he quickly disap
peared in the fog.
"When the raft was finished we suc
ceeded in punting It across to the land,
where we walked until we came to the
Moltzen place, where the family did
everything possible to aid us. Two of
us had only our trousers left and Mr.
Moltzen gave each of us an outfit M
clothing. We stayed with him and his
generous family until this afternoon,
when he drove us over to Marshall's,
where he presented each of us with a
railroad ticket to San Francisco and a
dollar. We left our benefactor at 5
o'clock this evening and it Is needless
to say that his kindness will never be
forgotten by us."
NO MUTINY ABOARD.
The four men tell a most harrowing
tale of suffering from exposure, but
also scoff at the idea of mutiny aboard
ship. They vehemently assert that it
was simple wreck, and that it was the 
fault of no one of the crew nor the
ship's master. In fact to Captain Inyre
they pay the highest tribute, asserting
he did all in his power to save his ship
from disaster, and even after they did
meet disaster gave orders how to pro
vision their boat, and in every way
looked out for their individual comfort.
He was the last to leave the ship and
would not get into the boat until every
one else was in. If he had left his ship
sooner the disaster to the second boat
might not have occurred. As It was,
she was dashed up agains^ the bark
and smashed to pieces. Then it was
every man for himself. The Francois
CAPTAIN "WAS LUCKY.
The men could not tell definitely just
where the wreck occurred, bur from
the description of the place where the
ship struck, and when they finally
made a landing on Pierce Point, the
wreck must be about eleven miles
north of the Point Reyes lighthouse.
The four survivors were unaware of
what became of the balance of the
crew, or at least those that were in the
other boat. Until to-day they thought
all had been lost but themselves. Cap
tain-Inyre, they are quite positive, has
been drowned, and one other of their
messmates they know Is dead, as his
body was washed ashore while they
were constructing the raft with which
to continue their journey to the main
land. __
The fog was dense and the survivors
in the boat floated around aimlessly
for hours, finally reaching shore at
Pierces Point, on Bodega Bay. At
this point they made a raft of logs and
brush and then proceeded on the main
land, walking four miles and finally
reaching the* ranch of Charles Moltzen.
Moltzen was at home and gave the
shipwrecked crew a hearty welcome.
One man, Nolene, was almost without
clothing, while the others were sadly
in need of nourishment. Food was pro
vided for them and clothing for those
that needed it. Two of the men were
nearly exhausted, but finally recovered.
This afternoon Moltzen took them by
boat to Marshall's. There he secured
transportation and all four left via the
North Shore Railroad en route to San
Francisco.
FLOATING AMID FOG.
The last seen of the ship'* master was
when he was clinging desperately to an
improvised lif*Â» -aftâ a table. His crew
tried to reach him, but was unable to
assist him and was compelled to leave
him to his fate.
at Bowens Landing, in Mendodno
county. . *
Others were able to get into a life
boat only to be again wrecked. Four
of these alone survived after untold
hardship. These four are Augustus and
Adolph Victor, Edward Nolene and A.
O'Neil. Captain Inrye is presumed to
be drowned, as are also the others of
the crew.
Two bodies were, seen floating near
the Point R3yes lighthouse last even
ing, and the corpse of Captain Inrye's
little dog was also washing around In
the heavy surf. At 10 o'clock last night
a report was received at Point Reyes to
the effect that two more men had
reached shore and were then walking
toward the lighthouse, but at midnight
the report had not been verified.
It was reported from Tomales that
two bodies had been washed ashore
near there.' Coroner Sawyer of Marin
county was notified and he will leave
San Rafael this morning for the scene.
No trace of the wreck has been seen
by any one except the unfortunate ones
who were aboard her when she struck.
Coastwise craft that entered this port
yesterday from the north had not en
countered" any wreckage, and even
along the # shore between Point Reyes
and Bo'wen's Landing no wreckage had
come ashore. The surviving seamen
explain this extraordinary fact with
the opinion'that as soon as the sea sub
sides the wreckage will come ashore.
Just now, they say. the trend of the
tide is outward.' The sea was calm off
Point Reyes last night, but fog still
hovered over the coast-,.
The complete list of survivors is as
follows: First Officer Edward Nolere,
August Victor, Adolph Victor, P. O'Neil,
James Webb, Fred Olsen, Samuel Rays,
Edward Anderson, W. G. Taylor, Jean
Conviek, Niel Louis, Fred Breken and
C. Augustus. Most of the' -crew were
shipped in Australia, which accounts
for the comparatively few Frenchmen
on the list.
"Captain Inrye is certainly drowned,"
said First Officer Nolere, "as he seemed
to be exhausted and with no hope of
reaching shore when we saw him
floating upon the table near the shore.
It. was impossible for us to aid him at
the time. We watched and shouted
words of encouragement until he disap
peared in the fog. No man qould have
clung long to that slippery" table in the
heavy sea that was running around the
promontory and dashing in mountain
ous waves against the rocks."
work and lack of sleep would have
made most seamen irritable, the Cop
pee's crew obeyed orders with a cheer
fulness that was remarkable.
One man living near Marshalls, how
ever, arrived here to-night and report
ed that he saw considerable flotsam off
shore about twelve miles north of thf
lighthouse. i
He Investigated, but could find nÂ«?
clew as to what ship the debris be*
longed. He stated, however, that while
he was en route to this place a rancher
informed him that while on horseback
this morning he saw a stranger several
hours before coming across the fields in
the direction of the hills. He was too
far away to tell anything about the
man and thought he was a tramp. Citi
zens of this town and Marshalls are
patrolling the coast in order to be of
assistance to any one who might possi
bly come ashore to-night. It is pre
sumed, however, that all the rest of the
crew of the ill fated French bark who
are alive have, either landed or else
have long since been, drowned.
The sea is calm off the lighthouse to
night, but there is still some fog hover
ing over the coast. Coroner Sawyer
will arrive here early to-morrow morn
ing and will drive to the place where
the body was washed ashore to take
charge of the remains. '
. ONE BY ONE GAVE TJP.
Progress was slow and the destination
meager. A landing upon the rocks was
out of the question. The men were buf
feted about by the waves, one by one
giving up. After daylight the contour
of the coast could be more definitely
determined, and about 7:30 the shiD
went to pieces. This gave the nearly
exhausted survivors better opportunltx
for their lives, as debris floated pasJ
them. The four men reached short!
several hours later. More dead than
alive they landed. The rock upon
which tHey found refuge was barren
and they at once set to work to reach
the mainland by means of an impro
vised raft. Just as they were leaving
on their raft one body was washed
ashore. When they reached Charles
Moltzen's place all was well. The men
were unaware that they were anywhere
near Point Reyes lighthouse, claiming
that the dense fog precluded them from
seeing the light at all.
They lost their bearings before they
reached Point Reyes and not being fa
miliar with the coast could not tell
where they were even after they
reached the Moltzen ranch. The light
house keeper at Point Reyes is wholly
unaware of any shipwreck occurring In
the vicinity of his station. Although a
constant watch wa3 kept during the re
cent storm for vessels in distress off
shore or ships wrecked upon the po!nt,
no one was reported in trouble. The
residents along the coast adjacent to
the wreck were also surprised that a
ship had gone ashore near here. Some
one of the ranchers is constantly pa
trolling the coast, but did not see the
Coppee on the rocks.
ONE MAN SAW DEBRIS.
The vessel struck on a ragged point of
land and settled almost at once. Cap
tain Inrye immediately realized from
the pounding against the rocks that his
ship was hopelessly wrecked and that
from the raging sea she would soon eo
to pieces. He gave orders to provision .
the lifeboats and leave the ship. Only .
two boats were available, the other two
being lashed fast and damaged and
wreckage was so piled upon them that
It was Impossible to get at them for
use. All hands were ordered into the
two boats, and after roughly provision
ing 1 them the order was given to- pull
away. Nine men were in one boat and
the balance In the other. The cap
tain's boat was the last to put off, the
other having left the ship's stern sev
eral minutes previous. When the last
boat was but a short distance away
she was dashed back against the ship,
swamped and broken to pieces. Several
men were knocked unconscious, while
the others swam for their lives. Some
stripped themselves of their heavy
coats In order to make progress . more
easy as well as to keep afloat. The
first boat was lost in the tog and the
men in the water thought they too had
been swamped in the heavy sea. The
waves rolled over the ship and some cf
the wreckage was washed overboard.
To this the men clung.
Coppee got out of her course on Wed
nesday while in a storm. Bearings
could not be regained from that time
till she struck, early Friday morning.
A shar? lookout was kept for sight of
shore and the sounding line was con
stantly kept in motion. The fog waa
very dense and It was impossible to
discern the shore line. The surf beat
ing upon the rocks could not be dis
tinguished from the waves at sea and
not until they struck did the lookout
know they were so close to shore.
SHE SETTLED AT ONCE.

SALT LAKE, Utah, Nov. 23.âGov
trnor^ Wells to-night decided to send
J he entire National Guard of Utah into
,, he coal mining districts of Carbon
bounty, where the miners have been on
strike for the past week. Sheriff Wil
cox notified the Governor on Saturday
night that the lawless element among
the strikers was getting: beyond his
control and asked that troops be sent
in order to protect and maintain law
and order. Yesterday Governor Wells
commissioned Brigadier General Can
non, commanding: the National Guard,
to investigate the conditions in the dis
turbed district and report as to the
necessity for troops.
General Cannon made his report to
ib* Governor this afternoon and to
r.ight Governor Wells announced that
he would issue an order calling out the
militia to-morrow. The State guard
numbers about 400 men and consists of
infantry, artillery, cavalry and Signal
Corps.
When the matter of fixing a date for
resuming the inquiry was discussed,
Watson said his eyes have been grow
ing weaker for several days past. For
this reason the referee continued the
hearing until January. . . ;
Watson declared that he got about
$6000 in dividends out of the Consoli
dated El Dorado Gravel Mining Com
pany. His attorney, De Frees, explain
ed that while Watson appeared to
have sDent much money for real es
tate, he only speculated in it and made
small payments.
PRIVATE PAPERS DESTROYED.
The witness said he could. not give
accurate answers to, many, of Attorney
Bach's Questions because he had de
stroyed most of his private papers.
Shortly before the close of the ex
amination Attorney David Gann asked
the witness a few questions on behalf
of the trustees of the Porter Bros.
Company. His queries were mostly,
concerning other stockholders in the
concern. . . - â¢Â»Â¦ ".Â¦Â¦ "Â¦].'
"Did you buy some from money
drawn out of the Porter Bros. Com
pany?"
"I'm not positive. I bought some
with dividends amounting to about
$7000 secured from the Booth-Kelly
Lumber Company. I also got a salary
of $10,000 a year from Porter Bros, and
$4000 from the North American Fish
eries, of which I was president for sev
eral years. I also had about $30,000 be
fore I went into business with Porter
Bros, in 1884."
"I borrowed most of it from various
parties, including a number of banks
and the Armours, at various times,"
was the reply.
"Where did you get the money to
buy these stocks?" asked Attorney
Bach.
Nearly all of these shares are hy
pothecated. Watson also scheduled real
estate of the, value of $97,079, most of
which is heavily mortgaged.

OGDEN ARMOUR SUBPENAED.
Watson's revelations regarding large
rebates received by him from the Fruit
Growers' Express Company, amount
ing, it is said, to at least $1,800,000, have
led Attorneys Bach and C. W. Green
field to search for other evidence on
this line. For the purpose of getting
more details they have subpenaed J.
Ogden Armour and George S. Robblns
to appear before Wean on November

CHICAGO, Nov. 23. â Extensive pri
vate Interests of James S. Watson,
president of the Porter Brothers Com
pany, were revealed before Bankruptcy
Referee Wean to-day, Attorney Albert
Bach of New 'York using the schedules
of the witness' own debts and assets
as tne basis for his examination.
It was shown that Watson was Inter
ested as a stockholder in a half-dozen
or more corporations, as well as being
the owner of much real estate, now
heavily mortgaged. The private sched
ules of Watson showed his debts to be
$1,295,000, much of which was contract
ed on account of the concern of w'hich
he was formerly president.
Of the total liabilities, only $104,375
was secured by shares of stocks. It
was for the purpose of learning the
probable value of these securities that
the New York lawyer pressed the in
quiry. This will be resumed on Janu
ary 13, at which time, it is expected,
Watson's eyes will be well enough to

Porter Bros. President
a Man of Many â¢
Affairs.
Entire State Guard of

Coal Minea
Morgan said that he had consented
to the enactment of, the Spooner bill
only because of his confidence in the
good faith of the President in enforc
ing the law, and now th'at the Presi
dent had not seen fit to keep that faith
it remained to be seen whether the Sen
ate would support him In that position.
The President, Morgan said; had
completed his campaign against the
Spooner act by having Hay sign a
treaty with "somebody" who had no
authority except that conveyed in a
cable message from a Junta at Pan
ama. Morgan read the correspondence
bearing upon the revolution to show,
as he said, that "the President had
known of the uprising on the isthmus
before it began and stood ready with
armed ships to protect those engaged
in it."
The pretense in Assistant -Secretary
"I think the President's appeal to
party discipline to force his opinions
on the country and his measures of ag
gression on foreign countries, In addi
tion to his power as commander-in
chief of the army and navy, which he
uses with a dreadful latitude of con
struction, is so strong a proof of heart
failure In the present wild moments
that I am encouraged to hope that
there are still some barriers that we
may rely upon to protect the peace and
save the commerce of the country. I
regret that party discipline is to be
used as a domestic policy force to pro
tect 'the transit' in Panama and to
guard the interests of the new canal
company. That we will get a canal if
Â«ne can be built in Panama I have no
oubt, for the President has said so.
Yet this result is not nearly so certain
or so safe as If he should obey the
Epooner law."
On the motion to adopt the report
Morgan of Alabama took the floor and
addressed himself to . the isthmian
canal question. He said he did not re
gret his retirement as chairman of the
Committee on Interoceanic Canals. He
disclaimed partisanship in the conduct
of the affairs of that committee and
declared that he had not and would not
reverse his position on the canal ques
tion at the instance of any party cau
cus. He discussed at some length the
attitude of the President In the matter
of the selection of a route for the pro
posed canal, and In doing so accused
Mr. Roosevelt of using his official po
sition to advance his personal views.
He referred to the Spooner act and said
no one could nullify It. The revolution
In Panama, he said, was a Cesarlan
operation, which took Panama alive
from the womb of Colombia.
CRITICISES THE PRESIDENT.-
Morgan charged that the President
had made the canal question a party
question and added:
Hale then presented the list of Sen
ate committees as agreed on by the
caucuses of the Republican and Demo
cratic Senators.
; Newlands also advanced the argu
i ment that in asking for a reduction of
j the duty on Cuban products exported
I to the United States, Cuba was making
I an exceptional request, and he thought
I we should respond by offering political
I rather than commercial union.
For himself, he had had in mind
Cuba's interests in presenting the reso
lution and he wanted it understood
that he represented no Spanish dons
nor American speculators: He had of
fered -the -resolution in no spirit of
spoliation," but because he had be
lieved that the measure would appeal
to the good sense of both the Amer
icans and the Cubans. Xewlands said
that he had provided for the attach
ment of Porto Rico to Cuba as a coun
ty or province in the conviction that
such a union would give the smaller
island a stability of government which
it could not otherwise obtain.
Lodge of Massachusetts express
ed regret over the introduction of the
rt-v-olution. Many people of our coun
try, he said, did not understand the
distinction between the Introduction
and the passage of a bill, and if our
people did not appreciate this differ
ence the Cubans must have a much
smaller degree of understanding. He
believed- the present debate would be
of good sen-ice In giving assurance
that the bill did not represent the
wishes of the Government or the peo
ple of the United States.
Spooner gave notice that he wished
to address the Senate in opposition to
the resolution and the motion to recon
sider the vote of reference went over.
Newlands of Nevada expressed grati
fication that his resolution should have
so early attracted attention. He agreed
with Hale In much that he had said
concerning the progress of Cuba and
the character of its people. Still, It was
a fact that Cuba had been compelled
to confess her inability to cope with
other nations in business affairs. He
also referred to the concession granted
to the United States for erecting forti
fications on Cuban soil and to our su
pervision of the foreign relations of
the island, as well as to the conduct
of its sanitary affairs, and said that as
a matter of fact Cuba had already
pEsumed the attitude Â«f a ward of the
United States.
CUBA'S EXCEPTIONAL REQUEST.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23. â Panama
and Cuba engaged the attention of the
Senate to-day, to the exclusion of all
other questions. Hale moved to recon
eider the vote by which the Newlands
Joint resolution for the annexation of
Cuba was referred to a committee and
several speeches were made on the mo
tion without disposing of it. Hale,
Lodge and Platt of Connecticut dis
avowed any desire on the part of the
United States to acquire Cuba and ex
pressed great regret that the resolution
had been introduced. Newlands de
fended the measure as presenting a
natural solution of the problem of the
relationship between the two countries.
The Panama question came up in
connection with the announcement of
the reorganization of Senate commit
tees, Morgan (Dem.) of Alabama being
relieved from the chairmanship of the
Committee on Interoceanic Canals.
Before the order went into effect Mor
gan took the floor and his speech proved
to be a discussion of the entire canal
Question, with liberal criticism of the
President for his course. He had not
concluded when the Senate adjourned
and will proceed to-morrow.
Before adjournment the Senate unan
imously agreed to vote on the Cuban
bill on December 16 next.
HALE" OPPOSES ANNEXATION.
When Hale of Maine moved to recon
sider the vote by which the Newlands
resolution for the annexation of Cuba
was referred to the Committee on Re
lations with Cuba, he spoke of a speech
in opposition to the policy proposed by
the resolution, saying that this country
had already declared its policy with
reference to Cuba by enacting the
Teller resolution into law. He would
not extend such an invitation to Great
Britain for the union of Canada to the
United States* or to Mexico for such a
union. In this connection Hale said
incidentally that he had no doubt that
there were men alive who would live
to see the annexation of Canada to the
United States. He closed by urging
the Senate- to take no step toward clos
ing progress in Cuba.

The better class of druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devote their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known value, in accordance with physicians' prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to deal with when.in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts "of a first-class pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an Excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so.pleasant, prompt and beneficial in it3 effects as
Syrup of Figg, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction.
Owing to the excellence) of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists 'to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have the name â " Syrup of Fig3" â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attemptingto deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in ono case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is' necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the* front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go totoneof the better class ot
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

for twenty-four. J3 The guests of honor
were Miss Gertrude Dutton and Mrs.
Charles Kindleberger, relatives of the
'hostess. The*, table was made artistic
with violets and pink roses, while cor
sage bouquets of violets were provided
for each guest. Everything was per
fectly arranged and those present were
delightfully entertained. The guests

The men eligible to appointment as
commissionea officers in the army,
through having achieved the highest
rank in the regiment last year, are
Robert Sibley, Henry Bronson Dewing
and Alan P. Matthew.
But now, even in the face of the re
port of Captain J. A. Johnstone, the
last Inspecting officer, the War De
partment has seen fit to put the Uni
versity of California on the list of col
leges that have fulfilled the require
ments. It is taken by men interested
in military affairs as a change of heart
in the administration at Washington,
at the very least, and by some is con
sidered not flattering to the inspecting
olP.cer.
Captain Henry De H. Waite, com
manaant of the cadet regiment of the
University of California, "was informed
to-day through the United States army
regulations for 1904 that the University
of California is among the few colleges
of the country that have come up to
the governmental requirements in. the
matter of drilling. Of the forty-five
military colleges in the United States
but twenty-two are accredited at
Washington, indicating that the au
thorities have been watching the de
portment of th'e various organizations
rather closely. Three of these twenty
two are Pacific Coast colleges â Cali
fornia, Nevada and New Mexico. ' .
The acceptance of the University of
California is more significant ;than
would appear at first sight. It was
only a short time ago that the uni
versity fought hard against the pro
posal that the cadets drill three times
a week instead of two, besides impos
ing other military duties. Besides this
the reports of the inspecting officers
these last two years have not been
very kindly. All of which made peo
ple think that the position of the uni
versity was a bit shaky at Washing
ton.

While there was no one in the kitch
en, the. baby toddled up to the range
and opened four Jeta in the oven that
were within his reach. The volume of
gas that poured forth communicated
with a lighted burner on the top of the
stove and the explosion followed. Doors
and lids from the range were scattered
around with great force and the stove
and apartment in which it was located
were wrecked. Occupants of the house
were alarmed by the loud report and
went immediately to the assistance of
the helpless child. It was some .time
before the little fellow regained con
sciousness and allayed the f,ears of his
parents, who though,t*thelr son was fa

The San Francisco, Oakland and San
Jose Railway will begin running
twenty-minute trains and boats over
its new ferry system next Saturday.
That announcement was made to-day
by General Manager Kelly, who has
given orders for a new schedule.
In order to be fully prepared for the
new schedule the new company's ferry
boats : Yerba Buena and San Jose
have been -.on the dry dock in turns
during the last forty-eight hours un
dergoing Â¦ some alterations to assist
them in getting up more, speed. The
boats, will have to go a little faster
than they do now, for after consuming
seventeen minutes out of every twenty
minute trip, there will be only three
minutes left in' which to load and un
load. The twenty-minute service will
be in use between the hours of 6 a. m.
and 7 p. m. each day.
The new company is negotiating with
Mrs. A. L. Acheson f or, . the purchase
of a strip of land at University ave
nue and Stanford place, with the idea
of building a depot there. A depot for
the new system is demanded, as there
Is no accommodation now ( for passen

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Nov. 23.
The matrons and their young charge
were guests at the St. John Hotel, in
which happened to be located the head
quarters of the Daughters. It was at
this hostelry that Mips Clary first met
young Barrette, the clerk of the estab
lishment, and a casual acquaintance
quickly ripened into a love affair. The
betrothal was a hurried sequence of a
few meetings between the young
couple, who quietly planned their wed
ding, which was solemnized without
the least attempt at ostentation at the
residence of Rev. Dr. Verehaw, rector
of St. Michael's EpiscopaP Church.
Immediately after the wedding Mr."
and Mrs. Barrette departed for Bishop
ville, S. C, the home of the husband's
parents. According to the message re
ceived here late last night it was the
intention of the bridal pair to at once
proceed on to Wilmington, N. C. where
it is their plan to visit a Miss Mears.
and from there they will go to Mont
gomery. Ala. Their bridal trip will ex
tend to New York, from where the
bride expects to return to California
with her husband.
Strangely the early morning mail
brought to the bride's sister, Ethel, a
letter from Maybelle, in which she
briefly referred to an acquaintance she
had made of a Mr. Barrette, but In her
missive she conveyed not the slightest
hint of her matrimonial intentions.
During the hours of speculation Mrs.
Clary often remarked that she was con
fident that her absent daughter had
made a good selection in a husband,
and while discussing the marriage she
said that she knew the young couple
were fully deserving of the parental
blessing that had been telegraphed
them in response to the surprising mes
sage received the day before shortly
after the wedding had ta"ken place.
Late last evening the anxiety of the
Clarys was relieved by a telegram re
ceived by The Call, in which the facts
concerning the truly romantic nuptial
affair of Mr. and Mrs. Barrette were
revealed. It was an event that devel
oped out of the convention of the
United Daughters of the Confederacy,
recently held in Charleston, at which
Maybelle Clary, chaperoned by Mrs.
Stephens of Stockton and Mrs. Voorhies
of this city, was an attendant.
MEET AT HOSTELRY.
LETTER, PROM THE BRIDE.
Mystery no longer surrounds the iden
tity of Charlton Shannon Barrette, the
news of whose marriage to Miss May
belle Claxy of Stockton in Charleston
yesterday came as a great surprise to
the . young social favorite's many
friends and admirers in this city and
proved a painful shock to her parents.
The brevity of the message from
Charleston which first conveyed to Mr.
and Mrs. Clary at the Occidental Hotel
the news of their pretty daughter's
marriage caused them many hours of
anxiety, for repeated efforts to learn
by telegraph who Mr. Barrette is
proved fruitless. It- was long after
midnight before the parents of the
young bride retired and only then after
they had been convinced that the hour
of night had passed when they could
expect an answer to their message of
inquiry.
The greater part of yesterday was
also fraught with anxiety in so far as
the loving parents were concerned, for
still they were kept in ignorance as to
who their new son-in-law was.
Fred Westphal, the missing clerk, is a"
Bon of J. C. Westphal. the senior mem
ber of the firm of Westphal & Sons,
owners of the Bay, City Milling Com
pany. He is about 27 years of age and
for the last two months has resided at
the family home, 1463 Eighth street.
The young man was recently married
and for. some time after his marriage
he resided at 925 Taylor avenue, in Ala.
meda. Hia wife was with him at the
Westphal home. She can offer no ex
planations* of his disappearance.
"He was always a little wild, more so
than any of the rest of the' boys, but I
did not think it possible that he would
ever do a thing like this, and I hate to
believe it now."
"My brother is not "a member of the
firm, but is employed as a clerk in the
office. He generally goes to dinner at
11 o'clock and returns to let me off at
noon. I was not in the office when he
left to-day and when he did not return
on time I thought he had been delayed
at the house and I left the office to go
to dinner.
"When I reached the house I found
that he had not been home to lunch,
but at the time I did not think any
thing of it. I returned to the mill and
found that he had not come back, but
before I had. time to try and find out
where he was the loss of the money
was discovered. Of course, Fred's ab
sence was at once connected with the
disappearance of the cash, and as some
thing over $800 was missing we at once
notified the police.
"I can hardly believe that my brother
took the money, but what elSe can we
think? He was the only one who
was alone in the office this
morning and the money was cer
tainly In the safe when the office
was opened. It could not have been
taken during the night, for not only
was the safe locked this morning, but
we also have a night watchman in the
mill from the time it is closed at night.
"I don't know of any reason that
Fred could have for stealing the money.
as he was getting a salary of $80 a
week and had no heavier expenses than
any other young man In his position. I
do not think that he gambled, and 1
never know from my own knowledge
that he played the races, but of course
he might have done both and I would
not have known of it.
George Westphal was reluctant^to be.
lieve .that his brother had stolen the
money, but said that Fred wasithe only
one who was in the office alone during
the morning. He told the following
story of the disappearance of the
money:
Eight hundred dollars tftsappeared
from the* safe in the office of the Bay
City Milling Company, First and Clay
streets, shortly before noon to-day and
coincident with the disappearance of
the money Fred. Westphal, a brother
of the members of the firm, dropped out
of sight and has not yet been located.
The loss of the money was discovered
by George Westphal, the bookkeeper of
the firm, on his return from lunch, and
the theft was immediately reported to
the police. .. :^--

Though Noone is registered at the
City Prison as only 19 years old his
father said the son was more than 21
years of age. Until a week ago young
Noone had been employed at Kendall's
planing mills. He will be arraigned
to-morrow morning In the Police Court.
Harry Orbell and Frank H. Fergu
son, the men who were held up by
Xoone. each swore to a complaint
against the young man. Had they
only known last night what the detec
tives discovered to-day that Noone's
pistol was unloaded Orbell and Fergu
son declare there would have been no
yielding to their assailant's demands.
Noone's weapon was found this
morning In the rear of the lot at 1133
Filbert street, where he threw* the re
volver after being brought to bay by
Deputy Sheriff A. B. Moffatt. In
Noone's possession when he was ar
rested was found $2 60, the exact
amount which was taken from Fergu
son and Orbell. The victims figured
closely and told the 'police this morn
ing that Orbell parted with $1 10' and
Ferguson with $1 50.
That Noone tried to involve a
woman's name in the robbery is the
statement of Deputy Sheriff Moffatt.
The prisoner hinted that he had com
mitted the crime -.to get; money with
which to purchase Jewelry for a girl.
A year or so ago Miss Julia Brasher,
residing at 1317 Fourteenth street, was
attacked at Poplar and Fourteenth
streets by a man, supposed to be a
footpad. Noone appeared on* the scene
as a gallant rescuer. .The pair have
been on intimate terms since and Miss
Brasher was an almost all-day visitor
at the Chief of Police's office to-day.
Miss Brasher, however/ declares that
she has yet to be informed that Noone
intended to buy her any jewelry and
she puts the suggestion away as
absurd.
After making a confession of guilt to
the men who captured him, Martin
JCoone, son of M. J. Noone, a pioneer
aÂ»d highly respected citizen of West
Oakland, was formally accused to-day
on two charges of highway robbery as
the result of his midnight expedition
early this morning and subsequent
capture. Â» *

ON ARMY'S LIST
OAKLAND, Nov. 23.â Every year for
forty-two years the warriors of Com
pany A of the Fifth Regiment of the
National Guard have given a ball on
Thanksgiving eve. They have laid
aside musket and sword, the military
bugle call has been superseded by the
strains of the waltz and the game of
war has given way to social amuse
ment on these gladsome occasions.
The forty-third of these events will
be given Wednesday evening, and in
stead of the great, barnlike armory,
the soldiers of the State will dance in
Maple Hall, Particular efforts will be
made this year to have the decorations
of unusual merit. Electric lights to
the number of 1500 will be. used, while
more than 500 flags will add color to
the walls. There will be special music,
and the indications are that the ball
will exceed in brilliancy and previous
efforts. In fact there has been so much
interest in- the affair that it was found
necessary to hold it in Maple Hall, the
armory being entirely too small. . . :
Company A of the Fifth Regiment
is the oldest National Guard- organiza
tion in the State, having been in ser
vice since 1861 without being disbanded.

principal part of the day was spent in

being conducted by District Attorney T.
T. C. Gregory and the defense by Archie
Campbell and Charles S. Perry of San

The case has attracted wide attention,
owing to the mysterious motive for the
crime. The evidence, will be largely; cir

to the affair. Pensacola and Potter were
both fishermen and the- crime committed

what had happened, the matter having

cer lying unconscious in the hold, two
members of the crew dead there and
another member of the crew so ill that
within an hour he too was dead.
The investigation which followed
showed the part which the sailmaker
had had in the matter,^*and inasmuch
as two of the dead men were those who
had had fights with him he was placed
In Irons. The three dead seamen were
buried at sea and every possible means
taken to save the life of the poisoned
first officer. For days the life of this
man was despaired of and he was in a
serious condition when the vessel
reached port. His life was saved only
by reason of the fact that as soon - as
he swallowed the poison he. realizing
the character of it, took a drink of
whisky, the best possible antidote for
carbolic acid poisoning.
Certain threats which the sailmaker
had made against members of the crew
caused suspicion to attach to him and
the captain believed that he had will
fully caused the death of at least two
of the seamen. He was therefore placed
in irons, not on a charge of Insubordi

will be kept in irons until the vessel

WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â Because of
the large number of desertions from
British vessels while in port at San-
Francisco, the British Embassy has
furnished to the State Department evi
dence against alleged "crimpers" in San
Francisco that will, It is believed, result
in a rigid investigation and possibly a
number of prosecutions. The embassy
officials assert that the so-called "Sail
ors' Home" at San Francisco is head
quarters for "crimpers."
Statistics collected by the Commis
sioner of Navigation show that there
were 638 desertions from sixty-four
British vessels, carrying 1778 men. Brit
ish ships from Australia have .suffered
desertions amounting to 27 per cent
â¢ana those from Europe 43 per cent. In
the opinion of the Commissioner of
Navigation Congress has power to
remedy the present conditions by pro
viding that only regularly licensed
agents shall be allowed to supply sea
men to vessels. The State Depart
ment, it is understood, has â¢ sounded
the British Government on this point.
The Commissioner, who has prepared
an exhaustive report on the question
lor submission to Congress, does not
find that the Sailors' Home is responsi-"
ble for deseiti^ns, but he suggests that
the British Consul General at San
Francisco, if put on the executive com
mittee of the home, would be in a bet
ter position to prevent "crimping."

WASHINGTON. Nov. 23.â Rear Ad
miral Coghlan, commanding the Carib
bean squadron, cables to the Navy De
partment from Colon under date of No
vember 21 that General Reyes, the spe
cial commissioner of the Bogota Gov
ernment, tenders his sincere thanks to
President Roosevelt and Secretary of
the Navy Moody for his gracious treat
ment at Colon by our naval force. Ad
miral Coghlan confirms the press dis
patches that General Reyes has depart
ed for Washington via Port Limon,
Costa Rica, for a confernce with Dr.
Amador, a member of the Panama
commission, and others in the United
States. Before his departure he in
formed Admiral Coghlan that the Pan
ama Government had cabled Dr. Am
ador to await his. (Reyes 1 ) arrival. Ad
miral Coghlan further reports that
General Reyes expects to make amica
ble relations with the special commis
sioners for Panama now In Washing
ton.
The Navy Department also has re
ceived a cablegram from Rear Admiral
Glass, commander in chief of_ the Pa
cific squadron, from Panama, under
date of the 21st, saying that the con
ference of General Reyes and the au
thorities of Panama was without re
sult and that General Reyes had sailed
for the United States.
It is believed here that, aside from a
proposition for Panama to assume part
of the Colombian foreign debt General
Reyes' main purpose is to advance the
suggestion that the capital of Colombia
be transferred to the City of Panama.
This is equivalent to the annexation of
Colombia by Panama. The opinion in
official circles here is that, though flat
tering, the proposition will be rejected
by the Panama commission if for no
other â¢ reason than because through
sheer weight of numbers the Colom
bians soon would control the adminis
tration of the reunited republic and the
situation as. to Panama would be as it
was before the revolution and separa

Ernest Hellam, who had quarreled with

the death of Alex Cartier, the French

was broken in several pieces and seem

heavy blows. The Opinion of the Jury

WILL SUPPRESS
THE "CRIMPER"
ROME, Nov. 23.â When the Cardinals
composing the Congregation of the Pro
paganda met to-day they received a
sharp reminder that they have at their
head, in the person of Prefect of Propa
ganda Cardinal" Gottl, a churchman of
clearly defined and strong opinions.
Those present at the meeting were Car
dinals Agliardi, Vannutelli. Segna,
Pierrote, Cassetta, Martinelll. Satolli,
Macchi, Delia Volpe and Gotti.
The Cardinal Prefect in his opening
address dwelt most earnestly on the
bad impression made on both the Pon
tiff and himself by the receipt of re
monstrances from Apostolic Delegates
and from Cardinals abroad against the
publication of the decisions of the Pro
paganda before they had been officially
informed of those decisions and even
before the decisions had been ratified
by the Pontiff. This matter had gone
so far, said Cardinal Gotti, that the re
sults of the meeting of the Propaganda
would be known in the United States
even before the meetings of the Cardi
nals had been actually concluded.
Continuing, Cardinal Gotti said that
he had in the strongest manner called
to the attention of all the clerks in
attendance on the Congregation of the i
j Propaganda that it was their duty to
observe the most complete secrecy, and
he wished to recommend the same
course not only to the secretaries, !
Monsignors Vacci and Savlli, but even
to the members of the Sacred College
themselves, although, he added,, he did
not suppose for a moment that any of
them would condescend to lower his
1 dignity by action contrary to the spirit
of the law regulating the affairs of the !
propaganda. j
Several Cardinals greeted the speech '
of the Cardinal Prefect by saying:
"Good," while others considered the
speech inopportune. These latter :
â¢thought that no damage could be done
to the interests of the church by the
publications of which the Cardinal
Prefect complained, as it was known
that the decisions of the propaganda
were not valid until ratified by the
Pope, while on the other hand it was
pointed out that the decisions of the
congregation were rarely rejected by
the Pope.
Some of the Cardinals expressed the ,
opinion that it would be assuming too j
much in these days of wireless j
telegraphy to hold that the announce
ment of appointments made by the I
congregation could be leisurely given
by mail after going through so many
hands. One Cardinal pointed out that
the Cardinal Prefect evidently had not i
considered the fact that in the matter
of time Home was six hours in advance
of New York.
The afternoon's reports show the
ftorm damage to be extensive. Fac
tory chimneys and windmills were
overthrown and roofs were blown away
throughout the central western dis
tricts. Heavy copperplates were blown
off the historical red tower at Halle.
on the Saale, and workingmen's tene
ments were unroofed.
The Prince Bismarck mine near

This is the season of the
year when Scott's Emulsion
does some of its best work.
Fortifying the system against
the ravages of winter is one
of the most effective uses of
Scott's Emulsion; it builds
up the strength of the whole
body and puts one in a
healthy, vigorous condition.
Weak lungs, throat troubles
or bronchial affections get
more positive help and relief
from Scott's Emulsion than
from any other source.
Cod liver oil itself is very
scarce just now ; cheap adul-
terations and mixtures of
inferior oils are offered every-
where.
This is why Scott's Emul-

It never varies from the high

that has made it the standard
for thirty years.

The United States Senate seems to
be growing more 'youthful. Thirteen
years ago a careful computation was
made from which it. appeared that the
average of its members was 60 years.
There were then but eight who were
less than 50 years old and one who was
less than 45. To-day the average is 59
years and 4 months, and in a slightly
larger Senate there are fourteen men,
instead of eight, who are less than 50,
and of these eight are less than 45. The
difference is doubtless due to the new
States which have come into the Union
since that time whose political leaders
were naturally younger men. The
Delaware overturn has also given the
Senate two youthful members. It is
almost a rule that the young States
have young Senators.
Only one Senator is more than 80, Mr.
Pettus, the junior Senator from Ala
bama, who was born in 1821. Fourteen
are between 70 and 80, twenty-nine are
between 60 and 70 and thirty-two be
tween" 50 and 60. The fifteen who have
crossed the three-score and ten line
include both Senators from Alabama
and Connecticut, besides Messrs. Teller,
Allison, Frye, Hoar, Gibson, Stewart,
Platt (New York), Quay, Bate, Proc
tor and Cullorn. The constitution of
the United States specifies 30 as the age
requirement for Senate, but by a
safe margin of ten years all of the
States have made good this condition.

* William Butler Yeats, the famous
Irish poet and prime mover In
the intellectual revival in hla native
land, is now delivering lectures before
Eastern universities upon the subject
of his life work.
Mr. Yeats' visit to America Is by In
vitation'of the Irish Literary Society
of New York. He is Identified with the
movement which, during the past ten
years, has aimed to reawaken a true
national consciousness in Ireland and
has already notably affected its poli
tics, literature and national' life. Of
the significance of this movement. It
has been justly said:
"The prospect of such a new Ireland
rising up out of the foundations of the
old with love and not hate aa its in
spiration has already sent a great thrill
through the land. It is a new and un
looked for situation, full with fate, not
only for Ireland, t>ut for the world.**
Some of the . organizations through
which the movement works are the
Irish Literary Society of London, the
National Literary Society of Dublin,
the Irish Literary Theater, the Feis
Coil Committee in Dublin, and the
Gaelic League. Two of its chief aims
are the revival of the Irish language as
a living speech, and the study of the
ancient literature with the creation of
a new Irish literature both in Irish and
English.

But. like every other detail in spar
ring, they must be mastered thorough
ly if they are. to be tried at all. An
awkward swing or an ill-timed hook or
Jolt will place you at the mercy of your
opponent. Moreover, there Is, with
most amateurs, a strong temptation to
swing or to hook on occasions when a
straight blow would be far safer and
more effective. Nothing but experi
ence, of course, can teach you the exact
occasion when a swing or hook is most
advisable,- but, by study and by prac
ticing carefully, you will gain a fair
working idea of it and future practice
will teach you the rest. For, In box
ing, more, perhaps, than In almost any
thing else, every man must buy his
own experience, paying for it in hard
knocks, and, if he be wise, profiting by
every detail of it.
In the tamest of sparring matches
one Is liable to receive a hard^blow;
to "run into" his opponent's lead or
to be the victim of that opponent's mis
calculation of strength or distance. No
blow from a soft eight-ounce glovp will
do you permanent harm. If it lands on
you more heavily than you anticipated
keep your temper. Don't sulk, don't
slug back. Take it as part of the day's
work and be thankful a glove and not
a bare fist dealt you the blow.
Draw on the gloves, stand on guard
and I will show you how. to swing.,
. Let your' sparring "partner lead '.*' for
your face with his* left. As he does so
move your heart to the right, just far
enough to avoid his blow (as in the
ordinary left counter for the face).
At the same time lower the left arm
from its position of guarding your heart
md turn the palm outward so that the
back of the glove and not the front
of the knuckles is turned toward your
opponent. Now bring your left â¢ arm
around in a circular motion so that at
a certain point in that circle the back
of your knuckles will come in : contact
with your antagonist's Jaw. In deliv
ering this - blow your arm should S be
stretched to almost Its full length, be
ing bent at the elbow Just enough to
avert any jar to the elbow joint. As
you swine your arm around to meet
his Jaw throw the shoulder with it and
let the force and weight of the body
go Into the blow. In a swing remem
ber the back of the hand is always
kept toward your opponent, and it is
the row of knuckles joining the hand
to the fingers (not the middle row)
that should strike him first. Be sure
to bring the "body around with the
blow. This Is the easier because the
moving to the right of your head Is
part of the general motion. The mov
ing of the head and' thedellverine of
the swing must of course be simulta
neous. Practice this blow very, slowly
at first, gauging most carefully the dis
tance your arm has to. travel and mak
ing sure' that your hand, turns natur
ally.lristead of twisting stiffly and awk
wardly. "The swing requires co-opera
tion from almost, every other "part of
the body.. Without this co-operation it
Is awkward and lacking in. force, pre
cision and .speed. ' . " " _'. '\ *
Do riot raise^ the. .heels from the
ground in swinging for Â¦ the â¢ f ace. Â¦/' Do
not swing when too close to or too far
away from your opponent. In the lat
ter case -you will miss him entirely. and
lose your balance, thus placing your
self at his mercy. In the former In
stance (if you are too close to . him)
your hand will go far behind him.
At first glance' the circular motion
would seem to be less effective than a
straight arm blow. But, "when correct
ly delivered, the swing and hook are
far heavier than any other blows
known to boxers> â¢
In all the foregoing lessons we have
dealt only with what are known as
"straight" blows â blows which are de
livered in such a way as to traverse
the shortest possible distance between
the position, "on guard," and the face
or body at which they are aimed.
As a straight line is the shortest dis
tance between two points, so the
"straight" blow covers the least pos
sible distance.
The 'â¢swing" and "hook," however,
are delivered fn a circular direction.
It is such blows we will now con
sider, as well as an almost equally ef
fective blow known as the "jolt."

SOME of our contemporaries are busy despairing of the
republic because a crowd of well-dressed ladies mobbed
the Goelet-Roxburghe wedding party in New York.
One concludes from it that "the American people, and es
pecially the American women, are crazy over titles," and that
"our admiration for republican simplicity is really only skin
deep." Now, we don't think the incident deserves such a
serious conclusion.- We think the nicely' gowned ladies, who
showed such bad taste in a struggle to get a sight of the
Duke, were actuated by no better nor worse feeling than
extreme curiosity. A Duke is a spectacle, a show, just
like Jumbo, or a baboon that eats with a knife and fork
and drinks his swipes like a man.
Every year are celebrated in this country international
marriages. .They are common between the sons and daugh
ters of artisans, merchants and financiers. The American
young man and young woman match with Germans, Irish,
Scotch, Italians, Russians, French and what not. Among
this enormous number of such marriages we have two or
three every year between rich young women and titled for
eigners Their thousands of sisters who marry foreigners
want husbands. They want titles, and we don't despair of
the republic because both classes get what they want. The
ladies who marry foreign titles don't stay here. They go to
the country of their husbands and are denationalized. They
lose identity as Americans, and there is so far no evidence
that their happiness is of such a high quality as to lure
many of their countrywomen to the same method of expatri
ation. They excite more curiosity than envy, and the re
public does not depend upon those who excite curiosity nor
upon those who yield to it, to the verge of vulgarity and bad
taste.
Human sentiment goes through continuous reaction. If
one generation goes wild over pageantry and pomp and cir
cumstance., the next, palled by what has become common,
runs to the opposite extreme. The English people under
went this in" the Puritan reaction against the pomp of the
court of the Stuarts and the' magnificence of religious ritual.
They went so far that legitimate human pleasures were
looked upon sourly, and life was made a prolonged penance.
Since that experience they and we have developed a more
3ane and sober mind than appeared in either extreme and
have not returned either to pomp or asceticism. It is only
necessary to see the resentment that is displayed by the vast
mass of our people, when they see any ostentation of wealth,
to feel sure that, our republican simplicity is safe. Â«The
masses resent not only sucjh ostentation, but they will not
be patronized by the rich. All this is a manifestation of that
spirit of American independence which is the safeguard of
our institutions.
The Duke and Duchess of Roxburghe have already passed
off the sensational stage, which they shared with the last
flood and cyclone, labor strike and train robbery, and Amer
ican liberty, is as safe and sound as it was when political
opponents were calling Washington an aristocrat and Hamil
ton a believer in a hereditary nobility.

Captain. H. Z. Howard, superintend
ent of the Oceanic Steamship Company,
was born In Connecticut and takes
pride in the circumstance. A sailor
man from the ground up, Captain How
ard- has all the old-time mariner's
grufrhess, but like the barnacles on a
ship's bottom the sharp edges are all
on the outside and the plate beneath Is
good, smooth, serviceable steel. It
takes time and patience to reach the
steel ( and In the operation the seeker
may rub some skin off his inquisitive
fingers.
"His bark is worse than his bite" was
not said originally about Captain How

know the superintendent would have
chorused, "How apt!"

People who have braved the barnacles
and found the good metal beneath have
no hesitation in accosting the captain
in Jocular vein and In every case the
man with the fierce frown - and kind

Captain Howard the other day and
now speaks of the superintendent as

"Major General Plumer. who led a
battalion of mounted riflemen In the
Matabeleland campaign In 1S96, has a
reputation rivaling that of 'the mildest
mannered man that ever scuttled ship
or cut a throat.' In the thick of the
fight he is the politest of warriors. As
an example of his unvarying 'drawing
room manners,' as a brother officer once
styled them, a story is told of him that
during the Matabele campaign hi3
small force found itself in a very hot
corner, and men were falling rapidly in
all directions. Plumer had two ma
chine guns with him, and these, he con
sidered, were not doing as well as they
might. He called up an orderly* there
fore "and said to him: 'Will you kindly
go to Captain Blank (who commanded
the guns) and tell him that I think he
might do better If he would please
move his guns a little further to the
right? Thank you.* And then he calm
ly went on with his direction of the
fighS in the same quiet, easy manner.
Again, he was rather badly hit while
in command of^a column during the re

sage to his second in command to the

The Insignificant role which water
power In this country can possibly play
In keeping up our Industries appears
on brief examination of the facts. It is
estimated by the best authorities that
If the entire rainfall over the State of
Pennsylvania were utilized with a head
of 150 feet, It would not yield one-tenth
the amount of power that is now de
rived In that State alone from the con
sumption of coal. But on the most ex
travagant calculation ii would not be
possible to make available In that
mountainous State one-tenth of this
theoretical amount of water power.
What then would be the condition of
those vast areas of the Mississippi val
ley where water power Is far less avail
able?
If we look to the rest of the world the
prospect is not more encouraging. The
coal fields cf Europe are mostly con
fined to small areas In England and the
northwestern part of the continent.
Spain, Italy, Greece, Russia, Scandina
via and the larger part of the German
Empire are dependent on England for
their coaL At the present rate of in
creased production these fields will be
nearly exhausted In fifty years. The re
maining great deposits of coal are
mostly found In China, where they
equal. If they do not exceed, those in
the United States. It may therefore be
fortunate for the worM that China Is
80 Blow In her development that her re
served resources of fuel shall yet be
available when that in the countries
more advanced In civilization shall fail.
It is therefore rather startling to be
compelled to face the fact that coal
belongs to the limited and rapidly dis
appearing reserved stores of nature. In
using coal the human race is intrench
ing upon its capital and recklessly
hastening an ultimate but inevitable
castrophe. It is estimated by the high
est authorities that the total available
coal treasures of North America cover
220.000 square miles, with an average
thickness of six feet of workable seams,
which would yield 4S00 tons to the acre.
The total amount of coal, therefore,
that is possibly within our reach in
America could not exceed 700.000,000,000
tons. But in the year 1900 alone we
were mining but little short of 300,000,
000 tonF, while the expansion of popula
tion and of business Is demanding an
increase at such a rate that two or
three times that amount will soon be
necessary to meet the annual demand.
At the present rate of increase in the
use of coal, therefore, the entire
amount accessible in North America
would be consumed in less than loO
years.
Coal Is the chief cornerstone of mod
ern civilization. Nearly all the labor
saving appliances must have coal to
make them effective. Outside of the
muscles of men and eniraals the chief
sources of power available for the use
of man are gravitation as It is set free
in falling â¢water and heat arising from
the chemical combustion of coal. But
waterfalls are stationary, and even
with the ability to distribute their
power through electricity, it Is avail
able as yet over only a limited area. If
all the power of Niagara should be
turned Into electricity It could not
profitably be distributed beyond the
limits of Western New York, whereas
coal can be carried to the ends of the
earth and Its power set free for use
wherever it is needed. If the prairies
of the West and the comparatively
level regions the world over, where are
found the best agricultural lands, were
limited, as formerly, to water power for
running their factories and mills, these
would necessarily be few and Insignifi
cant. Such great manufacturing cen
ters as Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, St.
Louis and Cincinnati would be impos
sible away from the mountainous dis
tricts. It would be a tremendous s&i.
back to the agricultural interests of
the Mississippi Valley if they were
compelled to dispense with steam
thrashers and steam traction engines
and substitute In their places the work
of innumerable droves of, horses and
mules.

People naturally look around for the reason, for the mo
tive, and, right or wrong, they seem to find both in the
desire of the church to resume polygamy. Naturally, this
conclusion is reinforced by such speeches as that of Apostle
Grant. The Ogden newspaper, characterizing our article,
says: "Its basis is Heber J. Grant's humorous speech of a
week ago, which was not intended to be taken seriously,
and was simply a good-natured play upon Utah's past pecu
liarities. But the witticism has offered excuse for those who
seek to estrange Gentile and Mormon and ruin business in
Utah."
It must be admitted that Apostle Grant chose a queer sub
ject to joke about. His wit was in the present tense, not
the past. He declared that he has, not had, two wives, and
that he wants a third if the law will let him take her. If
business is endangered in Utah, it is by the apostle's peculiar
idea of humor, 'and not because of any outside desire to dis
turb the favorable industrial conditions of an American
State.
Polygamy was considered as a Federal question when the
Federal Government conditioned the statehood of Utah
upon a permanent guaranty that the church would abandon
plural marriage. If the Mormon church now proposes to
use the political power of the State to protect a return to
polygamy, the matter is still a Federal question. The first
Republican national platform denounced "those twin, relics
of barbarism â slavery and polygamy." One* has been abol
ished by the Federal constitution. The other is subject to
the same treatment. It is no invasion of the rights of the
States to amend the constitution so as to forbid polygamy,
make it a Federal offense ami put those who offend exclu
sively under the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. If the
Mormons have in good faith permanently abandoned plural
marriage, they can have no objection to such an amend
ment. Will the Ogden newspaper, and the Deseret News at
Salt Lake, promise that such an amendment to the Federal
constitution will be ratified by, a Mormon Legislature in
Utah? Do they recognize polygamy as an anachronism as
much as slavery is? Do \hey look upon it as the Gentile
world looks upon it? Do they recognize it as a moral and
legal offense, per se, or do they regard it as wrong only be
cause it is prohibited?
This is a question which affects the aspiration of New
Mexico and Arizona to statehood. It concerns the future
of Idaho and Wyoming,* and, to a. degree, of Colorado and
Nevada. It is so far, reaching as to warrant action now to
permanently remove it as a domestic question, local to the
States. When it is made a Federal matter and put in the
hands of the United States courts, there will be no further
danger of a~ return of old antipathies and a ruin of the bright
prospects of Utah. - ., v

â¢ lishes The Call's remarks on the pro-polygamy utter
ances of Apostle Grant, and says it is one of many
anti-Mormon articles appearing in the press of the country
and that its careful reading will disclose the fact that the
author of our article is not a stranger to Utah affairs. . The
Ogden paper concludes, therefore, that ".these jnflamma-'
tory editorials are being inspired by a bureau of promotion
existing either in Ogden or Salt Lake, and having for its
object the arousing of outside public sentiment to antago
nize the Mormon people and re-establish within the State
the old bitterness that did so much to retard the growth of
industrial life and keep Utah in the throes of a religious
l warfare.."
As far as The Call is concerned we wish to disabuse the
mind of the Ogden editor in that particular! and to relieve
; anybody in Utah who may suffer from, the suspicion of en
gaging in the promotion of outside .criticism of the Mor
mons. We need no such promotion of our purpose to work
for the future peace and welfare of Utah by inducing the
Mormon church to act in good faith with the rest of the
country, by observing the pledges upon which : statehood
was secured. All the inside information we get is furnished
by the authorities of the Mormon church and the conduct
of Mormons themselves. ...
The United States does not propose to permit the re
sumption of polygamy in Utah. It is useless to plead that
resistance to it will disturb the industrial peace of the State.
If it do, the responsibility is with those who provoke that
resistance by violation of the law and breach of faith. Why
is the church in politics? What is the purpose\of its per
sistent control of politics? If it propose to keep faith and
observe the law it has nothing to fear from politics.!
The people of this country recognize Mormonism as a
form of religion, whose followers are entitled to that great
guaranty of. the Federal constitution under which all forms
of religion are free and equal. But when any church has
purposes which require that it control the political action
of its members, those purposes are inimical to the Govern
ment. The attempt to effect them through the political
power of the state is a substantial union of church and
state, which is abhorrent to the American spirit. It will be
admitted by every one in Utah that the signs are abundant
that the church throws majorities- either way in politics.
The people are at once suspicious when the members of any
church all vote one way, and make erratic and unaccountable
changes in political control, for which there is no natural
nor public reason.
It has been for some time evident that the Mormon
church puts itself first and the state plays a subordinate
part. Its colonizations outside of Utah are regarded with
apprehension, because wherever Mormon voting strength
appears it does not with stability of purpose divide on party
lines. Following the Mormon hegira from Nauvoo, that
people suffered great atrocities that made many martyrs,
but it was the destructive and inhuman explosion of pas
sionate resentment long accumulating and caused by just
such political subordination of the Mormons as is suspected
to be the practice to-day in Utah. So it would appear that
the habit of using political power for its own purposes is
inherited by the existing Mormon body.
"Come again," replied the cashier,
flipping back the double eagle that con
stituted the chief -part of the conduct
or's pile.
Slowly the conductor picked up the
twenty. He sounded it. He bit it. It
was lead, richly gilded, but'a counter
feit and a bad one. The passenger has
not since been "seen.
"I fixed him,", said the conductor
when he turned In his cash at the end
of his run. . . " ,- '
The passenger boarded the car, as
usual, and with a half apologetic smile
tendered his $20 gold piece.
The conductor took the coin, sank it
safely in an inside pocket and produced
five rolls of nickels, opened each roll
and counted the contents into the palm
of the passenger, withholding 5 cents
for that fare and a nickel for each of
the, previous free rides.
"Guess that will' hold him for
awhile," the conductor chuckled as he
walked forward to tell the story to the
motorman.
"Give me $20 in nickel?. I want to
spring a little bunch of small change
on a cheap guy who's been working
me for a week," said the wise con
ductor. -,r-:v.r:
He had traveled from Ingleslde every
morntng Â«for a week on the first car.
Each day he proffered a $20 gold pieco
when the conductor asked for his fare.
"I can't change that." was the con
ductor's daily plaint, and six times in
succession the man with the double
eagle deadheaded his way into the
city.
"I'll fix that fellow with the twenty."
said the conductor, as he stepped to the
cashier's window at the car barn.
The Last Laugh.
But no sooner was this land elevated
above the sea than erosive agencies
went to work to dissect it and to re
move its more elevated portions. Con
sequently it is estimated that more
than nine-tenths of the coal which was
originally deposited over Central and
Eastern Pennsylvania has been carried
away by the rivers and hopelessly
scattered over the bottom of the sea,
while the one-tenth which remains is
so folded up in the rocks that it is ob
tained with great difficulty. In the
more central portions of the Mississippi
Valley, however, the disturbance of the
strata has been less, and it is a com
paratively simple matter to obtain the
rich deposits.
the size of trees, the most of which are
tropical species. Indeed, â¢ during the
coal period In Great Britain the propor
tion of ferns there to the other plants
was far greater than It is in the tropics
at the present day, while tree ferns are
now wholly confined to tropical regions.
Abundant tropical forms of vegetation
are found in the coal seams In Green
land and on Melville Island as far
north aa the seventy-fifth degree of
latitude; indeed, everywhere during the
coal period the climatic conditions not
only of the temperate zone but of the
arctic lands were closely similar to
those of the present torrid zone.
But, for man's use, it was neces
sary not only to have coal accumulate:
It must be preserved for distant ages
and brought within his reach. If the
Mississippi basin had remained forever
below the ocean level its stores of ac
cumulated coal would have been un
uvailable. But, through causes which
we can but dimly comprehend, at the
close of the coal period the land all
over that area, which had up to that
time been slowly sinking, reversed Its
movement and bejan to rise. This
elevation was produced by lateral
pressure, which folded up the Alle
gheny Mountains and produced a num
ber of diminishing waves, so to speak,
in the surface of the land extending to
the center of the Mississippi basin.
soming of' winter flowers, and over a wide region of coun
try the ripening of winter fruits. To us, therefore, this
change of season, which, in the East, will bring blizzards
and snowstorms, with discomfort to all and danger to many,
will bring only a new sense of the joy of living, new im
pulses to activity and a new round of both business and
pleasure.
Of course; one good rainstorm does not make a good
season any more than one swallow makes a summer, but
the appearance of the first swallow is very sure to be fol
lowed by the appearance of others, and the abundance; of
this fir^t good rain gives promise of a propitious season*
throughout. In some localities the fall has been inade
quate to the needs of the farmers, but as a whole the State
has fared well and the prospects are that we shall have a
year of prosperity equal to any that have preceded it. We
have of late been putting the railroads to a hard strain to
supply cars and locomotives, to haul the fruit , ready for
market, and it now looks 'as if we might' give them a still
harder strain next year. 1 ,
In the city the most notable effect of the rain will be that
of brightening up .everything as soon as the clouds roll by.
With cleaner streets to walk and a purer air to breathe the
people-will feel a new vigor as they go about their. business,
and from this time on. holiday trade will boom. The skies
may be gloomy for the present, but every cloud thati helps
to make the gloom. has a silverjining and carries a golden
promise. .-.Whatever may be the conditions elsewhere, the
winter comes to California with a blessing "for everybody.

I A new chapter in the sensational
story of the prison break was written
when Harmon testified that on the
Friday preceding the big break, which
I occurred Monday, July 27, he had se
creted himself under the floor of the
prison chapel, as a part of the con
spiracy on the part of the desperate
men to carry out their plans to secure
their liberty. He and Gordon talked
the matter over, Harmon said, and
Gordon told him that Convicts Wood
(the defendant), Murphy, Eldridge,
Howard. Miller, Fahey aiyi Roberts
were in the scheme and that they could
be depended upon.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 23.â The prose
cution in the case of John H. Wood,
the Folsom Prison escape on trial for
murder, scored an important point this
morning, when it was brought out by
the testimony of one of the convicts
that Wood v.-as a ringleader in the con
spiracy to break prison last July.
John A. Harmon, a convict serving
seven years for a felony, was the wit
ness who gave the damaging testi
mony. He was put on the witness
stand by the prosecution, and, in
answer to questions by District At
torney A. M. Seymour, testified that he
had been approached by R. M. Gordon,
one of the prisoners who made his es
cape, and had been asked to join with
him and his confederates.
The statement was addresed to the
prisoner just before "the Judge sen
tenced him to imprisonment at San
Quentin for life, the extreme penalty
provided by law for the crime of which
Burbank wad convicted. When the
time arrived this morning to pronounce
sentence the prisoner's attorneys
claimed that Burbank had gone insane
in the few preceding hour's. Judge
Head allowed a request for an exam
ination as "to his sanity and nearly
every physician in the city partici
pated. All but one declared Burbank
sane. . .

There was a big attendance at the
regular monthly meeting of the Pres
byterian Home and Foreign Missionary
Society held yesterday at the First
Presbyterian Church, Van Ness avenue
and Sacramento street. The subject
for the month in the foreign depart
ment was a descriptive and remarkably
lucid paper entitled "Korea," written
and delivered by Mrs. H. T. Ames. The
home mission branch ttevoted Its time
to a consideration of. the , work done
among the Spanish in New Mexico.
The ladies of the First Presbyterian
Church announced that there will be a
sale of fine work at the church begin
ning Friday eveninsr, December 4. The
gale will continue throughout the after
noon of Saturday, December 5. It has
been determined to devote the latter day
almost entirely to children. There are
to be game3 and an entertainment in
conjunction with the sale and the pro
ceeds will go toward the piano fund and

OF CONSPIRACY
Isaac Chub, a colored man, was ar
rested early yesterday morning by
Policemen Sweeney and Kearney and
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of robbery. Chub Is employed to run
an elevator at 239 Post street and lives
at 17 Fourth street.
Mrs. Ellen Dougherty, an old woman
living at 409 Oak street, was on her
way to a butcher shop on Hayes street
near Laguna, shortly before 6 o'clock
j-esterday morning to purchase some
meat, and at the corner of Fell and
Laguna streets Chub grabbed hold of
her, threw one arm around her neck
to strangle her and snatched her purse
containing $S with his other hand.
Mrs. Dougherty struggled with him
and in his anxiety to get away from
her he poked one of his lingers Into her
eye, blinding her for the moment.
The butcher and Harry Free, a team
ster living at 43 Van Ness avenue, saw
the struggle between the old woman
and Chub and heard her screams for
help. .They ran toward the scene of
the struggle, and when Chub saw them
he broke away from Mrs. Dougherty.
By this time Free was close upon him,
and Chub made a motion aa if to draw
a revolver from his hip pocket and said
to Free: "Don't you come after me."
Chub ran down Fell street followed
"This is prayer in the highest sense
of the word. Not alone the prayer cf
sincere desire and supplication, but
more â the realization of God's all-pres
ence, all-power and all-life, yea, life
eternal."
"The aim of Christian Science is to
remove the cause, to awaken the '
patient spiritually and point out to him j
his true relationship to God. I
. "Every kind of sickness," said Judge
Haxina, "is the result of long ages of
human error, of straying away from
Â¦ God's law, and the Innocent suffer with
' the guilty. "We are all, more or less,
under the ban of these long ages of
transgression â¢jutil we come into an
understanding of divine law, by virtue
of which these human conditions may
be overcome and destroyed.
"Sickrj'eps Is caused by many reasons,
including vice, drink, sorrow, grief,
disappointment,, discouragement â and
.depression. Remove them and you
have taken array a percentage of this
source of sickness that would go far
toward transforming: the earth into a
paradise. There is no sickness -without
a cause. Sickness does not come of it
self. The true office of the physician
is to remove the czvss. and not to doc
tor the effects. The best remedy for
tho<Â»e forms of sickness v/hich are
WnoTrn to be the direct result of wrong
Jlvir.g is to sU>p the wrong living and
go to livir.s rightly.
After sneaking of the experiences of
Rev. Mrs. Eddy tÂ£at led her to found
the creed, the speaker stated that
Christian Science is founded on the
tenets of the mother church, which
constitute its declaration of faith.
He quoted the tenets of the creed,
composed of adherence to truth; the
belief in the infinite Ood; the acknowl
edgment of Christ, his Son; the un
derstanding that sin and evil are un
real, hence not eternal; the belief that
sin is punished, so long as it lasts; that
Christ's atonement is the evidence of
divine love; that man is saved through
divine love, truth and life, as demon
strated by the Galilean prophet in the
healing of the sick and the overcom
ing of sin and death.
".In speaking of the ills of mankind.
Judge Hanna said that evil and sin
and sickness were not the works of
God, that he did not create nor send
them, and they are no part of his law.
Judge Hanna handled his subject in
& clear and convincing manner, and he
anaJyxed his theme in the plainest of
langr-iajre.
The speaker dealt with the leading
phases of Christian Science, its aims
and purposes of uplifting and en
nobling. He explained the textbook of
the creed, of which the Rev. Mary
Baker G. Eddy of Boston is the author,
ixi.il which was first published in 1S75.
Christian Science was explained to be
a thorough exegesis of the Scriptural
method of healing all manner of dis
eases and of curing ail manner of sin
through the understanding of God as
an all-present. aJl-powerful, all-wise
&nd universal mind.
"Christian Science" wÂ£3 the topic of
an acdrvss delivered last evening by
Judge Septimus J. Karma of Colorado
Sprirgs, Colo., that attracted an aud
ience to the Alhazibra Theater taxing
the building to its capacity.
The gathering was a representative
one, and the careful attention accorded
to Judge Hanna was a proof that all
present desired to obtain further
kxowledge of the cresd that is world
wide in its scope.

The regular Monday meeting of the
Ministers' Association of the Presbyte
rian Church took place yesterday at 922
Sacramento street. The Rev. W. K.
Guthrie, minister of the First Presby
terian Church, gave some thoughts
that he said were suggested by read
ing Professor James' book on the va
rieties of religious experience. The
Rev. Mr. Guthrie said that Professor
James' standing was high scientifically
and that any work he published would
naturally 'attract attention.
He considered that Professor James
had treated his subject in a sympa
thetic'manner," holding that no special
class or school had endeavored to give
a fair hearing to the great many varie
ties of religious experiences. Value
was not determined by origin, said Rev.
Mr. Guthrie, but by results, and un
doubtedly in individual cases there
were many varied forms of religious
belief, he said, that brought peace of
mind, independence of character and
noble nature to individuals.

Miss Rose Hennessy, well

how she was cured of uterine
inflammation and ovaritis by the

bad cold eighteen months ago .while
menstruating-, and this caused inflam-
mation of the womb and congested

and kept pcrtinj worse. My attention
was called to your Vegetable 'Com-

performed, and I made up ray mind to

Miss Palmer was chosen president of

the Shirt Waist and Laundry Workers'
International Union for a charter for the
new council. A request will also be made
to the national body for 'funds to assist
in the organisation of the French laun

and by-laws were adopted. The question
of a uniform wage scale was discussed.
Arrangements ' were also mide for the
holding of a State convention of laundry
workers at San Jose on January 3. ,
A committee of three was appointed
by the Janitors' Protective Union to arbi

the employers over the new trade rules
lately made by the union. A like com

A meeting of the State District Coun

Fifty men and more-than one hundred
women cloakmakers walked out on a

assigned for the strike is the refusal of
the employers to give their help a half

After, finishing his work on the bag
the champion did shadow fighting. He
held one-pound dumb-bells in his hands
and danced all over the improvised ring.
He imagined he . had Fitz before - him
and lunged out . in ' a businesslike
fashion. .., George kept this : up . for ten
minutes and then went downstairs for
a ; rub-down. In the morning he ; took
a two-mile sprint through the canyon
and satisfied himself that his wind and
limbs were in perfect shape.
-Gardner will do no more boxlng.'For
the last ', four weeks ' he has labored
In punching the bag yesterday Gard
ner landed knock-out blows for twenty
minutes and waÂ£ breathing naturally
at : the end of this energetic exercise.
The bag was a heavy one and Gardner
did not attempt fancy work. He sim
ply smashed the leathern globe with
either, hand as if he were aiming at
Fitz's jaw. Every blow resounded
through the gymanslum. < "Sandy" Fer
guson's blows on the same bag ten
minutes before were love taps in com
parison. â¢ -."
GARDNER IN FINE SHAPE;
Fitz certainly has some of his old
time fire. In training he has shown ag
gressivenes and punching ability and
every visitor to the training quarters
marvels at his physical powers. In
private he has hammered Joe Kennedy
and Sammy Berger to his heart's con
tent. In public he has allowed his
sparring partners to lambaste him at
will. In fubllc he has coughed and
shown his awkwardness in order that
reports of his form may reach â¢ his
young opponent. If Fitz hopes to de
ceive Gardner into a state of overcon
fldence he is deceiving himself. Gard
ner facetiously remarked yesterday
that "Fitz has more 'stalls' than a
livery stable." Gardner says he is
on to Fitz's tricks. He has seen Fitz
battle a number of times and knows
his style. He has the advantage of
the Cornishman, as the latter has ne.ver
seen Gardner In the ring. *-
Gardner is -in magnificent condition.
His "whole body is a mass of hidden
muscles. He is a handsome specimen
of manhood, full of vigor and confident
he will beat the lanky blacksmith.
Gardner's skin is as white as an in
fant's".' His head is supported by a
massive neck and his broad shoulders
would attract attention at all times.
His arms are well developed. The
muscles are supple and he uses his fists
with great skill. â¢.-.-Â¦
FITZ STILL FOXY.
Gardner will go into the ring a
heavier man than his opponent. He
will have the same reach, and, in the
opinion of many who have seen the
Lowell boxer perform, just as hard a
punch. Fur's shoulders are no broader
than Gardner's.
There seems to be but one topic in
ring circles nowadays and that is the
Gardner-Fitzsimmons contest, which
will be held ln Mechanics' Pavilion to
morrow evening. Interest in this
match grows keener as the hour of bat
tle draws near. The merits of both
men have been weighed and their
chances of-, victory discussed. Fitz
seems to have experience and the power
to land knock-out punches in his fa
vor. On the other hand, Gardner has
youth and vigor, cleverness and speed.
Despite all these requisites that have
made Gardner a champion in the light
heavy-weight class, the supposedly wise
men are picking Fitzsimmons to win
and the odds are 10 to 9. Those who are
playing the short end are banking on
the old adage that "youth will be
served." â¢ .
"If I don't defeat Fltz," said George, â¢
"it is because he Is a better man than
I am. 'I have no excuses to offer. I
never felt better In my life. My hands
are in fine shape and I feel stronger
and am bigger than ever before. Fitz
is tricky and I will fight carefully, if
we get to in-flghting he will imagine
he has been hit by a battering ram. I
have not mapped out my fight. I don't
say I will crowd him as I did when I
fought Carter. The battle will develop
different moves on my part. I know
I am going against the 'foxiest* man
in the' ring. If youth, strength and a
desire to- win count for anything I
will win."
"Billy" Delaney, the veteran trainer,
will go behind Fltzsimmons. He agreed
to do so on one condition, that he re
ceive no compensation. He told Fitz
'that he would second him because of
LOWELL MAN CONFIDENT.
Gardner showed a few days ago that
he could handle "Sandy" Ferguson, the
big heavy-weight who Is matched to I
box Jack Johnson. Gardner boxed two
rounds with Ferguson and "Sandy" had '
enough. Gardner did not attempt to i
knock Ferguson out. He simply kept
jabbing Ferguson's head back and
making the big fellow look ridiculous.
Ferguson tried to even the score yes
terday by trying to knock Harry Foley
out. Foley showed to advantage
against the human "ice wagon." Harry
caught "Sandy" flush on the nose in a
mix-up and Ferguson tried to knock
Harry through the window, but Foley
side-stepped out of danger.
hard, and Is In readiness for the sound
of the gong. After being massaged by
Foley and Barry, he weighed in for
the newspaper men and tipped the
beam at 168 pounds. Gardner will be
gin "drying out" to-morrow, and when
he weighs ln on Wednesday afternoon
at Corbett's he says he will weight 167
pounds.

WASHINGTON, Nov. ;Â¦ 23.â Bennings
summary: â¢ ; *
BENNINGS AND LATONIA BACES
"The latest suggestion on the subject,
which is -favorably received, is that
Messrs. Contes, Clark and Donaldson
should head three Beparate syndicates
and have three yachts, designed re
spectively by Watson, 1 Fife and Mylno,
the yachts to be raced throughout the
summer and the best one to be selected
to challenge in 1905."
LONDON, Nov. 23.â Peter Donaldson,
who formerly owned the famous racing
yacht Isolde, when questioned to-day
regarding the Glasgow Herald's state
ment, said that he was jiot connected
with the syndicate mentioned and
knew nothing abotit the matter.
BERLIN. Nov. 23. â Lord Lbnsdale,
who, on the occasion of his present
visit to Emperor William, is acting as
"Embassador of the American Yacht
Clubs," spent five hours with the Em
peror to-day. The delicate relations
between the Atlantic Yacht Club and
the New York Yacht Club were dis
cussed and a way satisfactory to all in
terested in the difficulty of selecting
fhe club which will present the Em
peror's trophy for a trans-Atlantic
yacht race will probably be found. In
the meantime no decisions have been
taken. *
GLASGOW, Nov. 23. â The reported
intention of Clyde yachtsmen to chal
lenge for the America's cup was to-day
confirmed by the Glasgow Herald. The
paper adds: f
* Eddie Hanlon and Young Corbett. the
feather-weight champion of the world,
were matched last night by the Hayes
Valley Athletic Club to battle twenty
rounds on December 20. They have
agreed to weigh in at 129 pounds at 6
o'clock. Corbett would not make the
match unless Manager Morris Levy
gave him 10 per cent of the irross re
ceipts as a bonus. Levy declined to do
this, but compromised by allowing the
fighters 50 per cent of the gross receipts
and Corbett 6 per cent and three rail
way tickets. The club's offer was ac
cepted by Young Corbett and the match
was made. Hanlon will go into train
ing at Croll's Gardens on December 1.
Harry Foley will look after him. aa
usual. Young Corbett will probably
train at Sheehan's on the oc*an beach.
Harry Tuthlll and Tim McGrath will
put him into condition. Manager George
Weeden will look after the champion's
interests.
The first preliminary will be brought
off promptly at 8:20 p. m. Every effort
will be made to have the big fellows
ln the ring before 10 o'clock. Chief
WIttman has detailed a large number
of officers to be on hand to keep the
crowd in cheek. Every ticket holder
is guaranteed his seat.
HANLON TO MEET COBBETT
Two good preliminary contests will
precede the main event. Johnny Ritch
ie, the ex-champion feather-weight, will
show the local ring-goers what he can
do in the ring. He is to box George
Curran six rounds for a decision.
Ritchie came here to fight Frankle Neil.
and if he defeats Curran decisively will
make a bid for the match. Mauro Her
rera, the Mexican, is to go six rounds
with Joe Bell at 135 pounds. Charles
T. Kreling, the champion wrestler of
the Northwest, and a clever judge of
boxing, will referee the bouts. Kreling
for many years held the amateur
wrestling championship of the coast.
He is a prominent member of the Olym
pic Athletic Club of this city and has
been in Alaska for the last five years.
Manager Coffroth is of the opinion
that Gardner and Fitz will fight before
a $26,000 house. The sale of seats has
been exceedingly large and he bases
his calculations on that.
PRELIMINARY BOUTS.
Dr. Clarence F. Tillman, the club's
official physician, will visit Gardner
this morning and examine him in order
to certify to his physical condition, as
required by the law. Dr. Tillman will
also take Gardner's measurements.
Manager Coffroth was busy; yester
day completing arrangements for nne
big battle. He announced that the gal
lery doors would be opened at 6:30 p. m.
and the doors leading to the lewer floor
of the pavilion would be opened at 7:15
p. m. . .
Fltz was out on the road in the morn
ing, well muffled, and when he returnei
to his training camp he was covered
with perspiration. In the afternoon he
punched the bag and did other gym
nasium work. He felt In better spirits
because he had broken up his cold.
This cold had been with him for the
last two weeks and had bothered him.
He thinks he will be well rid cf it to
day and when he goes into the ring
to-morrow night will be in his old
time form.
The men will weigh in at 3 o'clock
to-morrow afternoon at Corbett's.
Harry Corbett has issued tickets to
newspaper representatives, officials and
friends of both men to se? this im
portant ceremony. They will gain ad
mission on Ellis street. C '
FITZ BID OF COLD.
TACOMA. V.'aah.. Nov. 23.â In the
fiercest and cleanest football game ever
played in Washington the University of
Puset Sound defeated the University
of Nevada by a score of 10 to 0 in two
20-minute halves this afternoon.
Only once could Puget Sound's goal
be said to have been ln real danger.
Nevada twice prevented touchdown3
for the time by magnificent rallies in
side her 15-yard line. Both teama
played wonderful offensive games. Ne
vada's work with the ball, while th*;
more spectacular at times, was the
more erratic. On defensive Puget
Sound clearly excelled.
The local team toward the end of the
game tore through Nevada's line at
will and circled the ends for good gains.
At this stage of the game Kevada took
a wonderful brace. With darkness
closing over the field and the score 10
to 0, Fries, the fleet halfback, tore
around Puget Sc-und's right end, once
for 35 yards and again for IS yards. A
moment later the referee's whistle blew
for time.
In the second half Puget Sound
pounded Nevada's lln# at will. Steckle
retired with a broken collar bone to
ward the close.

President Williams stated on the ferry
boat last evening that when Ingleside
opens the California Jockey Club will
give two 51000 handicaps every week, one
to be run on Wednesday and aijother on
Saturday. There will also be other han
dicaps for $SO0 purses.
In his early two-year-old form before
he had been Introduced to the game with
the silk up, Barney Schreiber thought he
had a world-beater in Otto Stifel and re
fused $25,000 for the colt from the man
after whom he was named. Last spring
the two-year-old was taken sick at Little
Rock along with the balance of Barney's
best horses and has never amounted to
much since.
The case of the horse Harry Thatcher
i.Â« liable to become a badly tangled up
mÂ«?ss before his ownership i* decided by
the courts. The horse is held by Mrs.
Hastings of Oakland on an unpaid board
bill. "Long . Willie" Johnson laid the
matter before the Justices' Court of Em
eryville and was declared the animal's
owner. Then Mrs. Hastings furnished a
bond and carried the case to a higher
court. After Harry Thatcher won yes
terday "Long Willie" Md the horse up
from J400 to Vm. If the higher court de
cide* in favor of Johnson the latter will
be the loser, for the California Jockey
Club will withhold the purse until the
matter is settled.

put hfm over. Jack Martin took the
second choice. Harry Thatcher, out in

fashion. The Doctor took some strong
urging all the way and did succeed in
finishing ahead of Rose of May for the
place. .
Barney Schreiber's Sain colt. Otto
Stifel. was herajded as a certainty for
the two-year-old scramble at five fur
longs. The youngster went into the
starter's hands a 7 to 5 chance, and
chiefly through D. Hall's clever riding
gained a head decision over Sir Apple
by. a 20 to 1 shot. Miss May Bowdish
another outsider, ran a close third. Ad
kins on Harbor had a very tempestuous
trip.
As Kunz, who rode Dotterel, is not
very well known in these dippings the
odds against Dotterel in the betting on
the first event went from 3 to 5. The
fllly met with fair racing luck and won
handily from Quatre and Tote Gratiot.
L<eash. which was made the medium
of quite a plunge, closing a 3 to 1 fa
vorite, failed to show any speed to
speak of.
Besides San Nicholas the other suc
cessful favorites were Otto Stifel and
Lord Melbourne, and both were heavily
supported by speculators in general.
While Dotterel came in for no vast
amount of backing, Harry Thatcher
and Pickaway, two other winners, came
a long way from being good breaks
for the ring, which lost heavily on the
afternoon.
For Just a few moments those who
backed San Nicholas to win the third
race, a six furlong sprint, at Oakland
yesterday, felt a feeling of uneasiness
creeping over them. It was when Otis,
who piloted Martinmas, lodged a claim
of foul against Adkins, the rider of San
Nicholas, with the Judges. The track,
of course, was muddy, which was all
in favor of the latter horse, whose un
derpinning is as rickety and uncertain
as the foundation of a Telegraph Hill
tenement house. He was enthroned an
oven-money choice and a furfong from
the wire It looked to be only a ques
tion of how far he would win. Sud
denly the favorite began flashing dis
tress signals and Adkins took him from
the center of tlfe track to the rail. This
brought him in front or Martinmas,
which was getting a bit groggy also,
and while it did not look like an actual
case of fouling it was a very close call.
The Judges concluded to place the
horses as they had finished, which gave
general satisfaction. Royal Rogue took
show honors.

William Jones, M. P., of North Dev

prior ,to leaving the State. , Mr. 'Jones
is one of the authorities on educational
matters connected with the English

will be banqueted by the society.

One policeman states that soon after
the attack he saw a man and a woman
running from the scene, but was not
close enough to get a description of
them. Captain of Detectives Martin
can do nothing In the matter, as An
derson will not talk. ; "
"It is his own affair," said the cap
tain. "He evidently knows why he got
It and he must be satisfied that it was
coming to him."
Professor Waldron W. Anderson, a
dancing teacher at Saratoga Hall, who
resides at 330 Turk street, received a
handful of pepper .In the eyes and a
blow from a club on the head, shortly
after 7 o'clock last night. According
to the only witness, a man and a
woman committed the attack and
made a hasty escape from the scene.
The professor knows who the guilty
parties are, but evidently has good
reason for maintaining silence.
Anderson was walking on the east
side of Hyde street, between Ellis and
O'Farrell, when the affair happened.
His eyes were filled with pepper and a
well-directed blow on the top of the
head laid his skull bare. He immedi
ately shouted for help and Policeman
John N. McGee, who resides in the
neighborhood, ran to his assistance.
The man, crying loudly from pain, was
taken to the grocery store of F. Bab
horn and later to the receiving hos
pital.
Anderson evidently seems to think
that he deserved what he got, for, ad
mitting that he knows who the guilty
parties are, he refused to aid the police
in an investigation and is eager to let
the matter drop. The theory of the
police is that there is some woman in
the case and that the attack was. one
of revenge. What story lies behind will
be suppressed so far as the dancing
master Is concerned.
Assistant District Attorney Rolfe L.
Thompson made the opening argument
for the prosecution. He was followed
by ex-Congressman John A. Barham
and J. W. Rose of Healdsburg for the
defense and District Attorney Charles
H. Pond closed the argument. .
In the morning Mrs. Drayeur . was
taken over the scenes of the tragedy,
both by direct and cross examination.
She frequently cried during her recital
of the events preceding the, tragedy.
She declared that she struck her hus-
I band a light blow, on the forehad with
a stick of stove wood, but that the
force of the blow was Insufficient to
break the skin on the forehad or leave
a mark. Subsequently she heard Mr.
Drayeur's body fall In the bedroom and
then heard violent noises, as If furni
ture was being moved and broken, and
also heard the crash of crockery.
She testified to her fear of her hus
band, his repeated threats to kill her,
and detailed how at one time just pre
vious to his death she had called at a
neighbor's house for protection from
her husband. Drayeur, she said, had
driven her from their home with a^
hammer, and when a "neighbor went
over to pacify the- husband he was
found standing at the gate with a
heavy hammer In his hand waiting for
his wife's return.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 23.â Mrs. Sophie

Ing which changed the executive officers
W. J. Bartnett resigned from the di

Fued ajid subscribed. They claim also
that the stock is ready marketable at
At the same meeting It was voted to

director. Truman and Turpin applied
to Superior Judpe Hebbard for an or
der to restrain the transfer of stock to

more than $30 per share. When the
hearing for the application came up
yesterday Truman and Turpin, through
tfrieir attorneys, deposited a sack con
taining $15.125 â or $125 more than Grif

nounced that 'they were ready to pay

On one side are I. J. Truman and F.

by what they claim was a minority of
the stockholders, who elected J. P.
bwift president and Dr. Allen Griffiths
vice president. The reasons for this
radical upheaval were Bet forth In a
resolution submitted to the meeting. It
etated that Truman made loans with
out the knowledge or approval of the
other directors: that he. with other
members, entered into an agreement
with the San Francisco National Bank
by which that Institution would carry
a large part of the Columbian Bank on
deposit â¢rithout interest as considera
tion for a loan by the San Francisco
National Bank to Truman and others
at a low rate of interest on their per

of the Columbian Bank, permitted in
t orrect repc-rts of the business of the
bank to be made to the directors and
that he concealed information which he
should have imparted to them; that
Truman participated in the payment of
exorbitant salaries to officers, and that
his administration had been character
ized "by inexperience, incompetence
and mismanagement." Similar resolu
tions regarding Turpin were read and
approved and then the upheaval oc
curred.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
remanded to the State courts for trial
yesterday the suit of Angelina B. and
Bernard Dougherty vs. the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Com
pany and John Doe to recover $50,000
damages for personal injuries sustained
by Mrs. Dougherty on October 23, 1900,

passenger on the company's line.
In the case of the Contra Costa Wa
ter Company vs. Horace W. Carpentler
and Cortland S. Van Rehsselaer the
plaintiffs' motion to remand the case
to the State courts was denied. The
motion was made on the ground that
the Federal courts have not'jurisdic

brought to condemn certain land in
Alameda County, for the purpose of a
reservoir for supplying waters for the

s The Inspectors also Investigated the
loss of the steam schooner Ruth in
Fishermans Bay on November 11 at
9 p. m. The testimony showed that the
Ruth broke her moorings and struck a
rock In that harbor and sank. The loss
was $50,000. Captain E. Reed was in
command. The matter was taken* un
der advisement.
Owing to the position the mates were placed
In by the master leaving the vessel as he did.
and although they may have erred in Judg
ment in some ways, we do not blame them,
as they (succeeded in saving on the rafts the
twenty persons left on board, five of whom,
however, afterward succumbed to exposure.
The South Portland was equipped' with two
lifeboats and one liferaft. having in all a boat
ago capacity of 550 cubic feÂ«t. Kight passen
gers, nine crew and two stowaways were lost.
Twenty-two lives were saved. The vessel was
valued at $35,000 and her cargo at |27,000.
MATES ESCAPE BLAME.
Had he done so the boats would have pre
sumably got safely away from the ship, as
from the testimony tho wind was not high
nor the sen. rough, and the vessel did not sink
for forty-flve minutes after striking. More
over, we find that Captain Mclntyre did not
have fire and boat drills since he took com
mand cf the vessel: had he done so ther* would
have been better discipline of the crew and
they would have known their stations (which
from the evidence they did not) and be more
skillful in handling the boats. For reason of
such necllKence and unskillfutness as above
on his part as master of tha steamer South
Portland we have this date revoked the license
of Captain James B. Mclntyre as master and
pilot of steam vessels.
C. C. Bruce, chief mate was In charge of the
bridge "when the vessel struck, but was steer
ing the coursf and running the speed as or
dered by the master, who had charge of tha
bridge forty minutes before. After the master
left the vessel the mate was in charge with
twenty people on board with one raft only.
The first and second mates with the crew im
mediately went to work to construct a raft
from the only material available left on the
vessel- and had there been more time would
have been able to build a larger raft, which
would have been more buoyant or seaworthy
and probably would have saved all the people
left on board, as they were mostly crew (three
of the passencers having been drowned by the
capsizing of the starboard boat).
DID NOT DRILL CREW.
After careful consideration of tha testimony
in this case we are of the opinion that Captain
Mclntyre wag negligent and unskillful in navi
gating: the steamer South Portland on October
19, 1003: In running: that vessel full speed
and steering a course that would take her so
near Cane Blanco in a thick tog; and when
coming: In the vicinity of so dangerous a part
of the coast at CaDe Blanco and Orford reefs.
In not taking soundings more often and In not
uelrg the colored tubes Instead of trusting to
the length >of wire run out from the sounding
machine, to get the depth of water. Also,
after the ship struck and he found that the
vessel waa sinking- and It was necessary to
abandon her, that he did not stop the engines,
call all the crew on deck and station them to
the boats and raft* In charge of their re
spective officers and look tfter the lower end
of the boat himself, instead of leaving the
ship in the chief mate's boat.
Captain James B. Mclntyre, late of
the South Portland, Is out of a Job.
This fact was made public yesterday
afternoon by Captains Bolles and Bul
ger, United States local inspectors. In
an elaborate report in which they cen
sure the captain for his conduct on the
occasion of the wreck of the South
Portland and for having neglected to
have fire and boat drills. For these of
fenses his license was revoked.
The steamer South . Portland was
wrecked by striking upon a rock near
Cape Blanco, Or., at 4:40 p. m. on Oc
tober 19, 1903. Eight passengers, nine
of the crew and two stowaways were
drowned. The opinion was written by
Captain O. F. Bolles, In which, after
summing up the evidence, he says:

George F. Reed "butted in" and was
arrested for burglary. His case came
up before Judge Mogan yesterday. The
defendant has been in the marine. ser
vice of the United States for fourteen
years and had a bundle of recommenda
tions that a hound couldn't Jump over.
Then he told his story. While passing
along the street he witnessed a fight
between Messrs. Powers and Bailey In
front of Murphy's grocery at 926 Hbw
ard street. Mr. Powers rudely and vio
lently threw Mr. Bailey through the
window, of Murphy's grocery. Bailey
was cryinsr for help, and the gallant
marine climbed through the orifice
made by the muscular efforts of Mr.
Powers and assisted Mr. Bailey to
make his exit. Then the Idea occurred
to him that he should patrol the deck
of the grocery to prevent a burglary.
Policeman Desmond came along and,
noticing the broken window, rapped on
the door. "Come in.!' said Reed, and
the policeman accepted the invitation.
Reed's story struck the policeman as
untruthful and he locked up the ma
rine for burglary. Judge Mogan
promptly dismissed the case with a
feeling In his heart that a faithful ma
rine like Reed should have a gold medal
instead of a commitment.
William Simpson, who was accused
of persistent begging on the streets by
the arresting officer, found an old-time
friend in Judge Fritz. "Why, Judge. I
knew you when you were a little boy
in Sacramento. You played around my
knee." Old home memories surged over
the Judge, like the .sound of the sea in
a shell, but he could not recall the face
of Simpson, who claimed to have pat
ted his head in boyhood. "Particularly
where do' you remember me In my boy
hood?" queried the Judge. "Why, you
were around the office of the Capital
Hotel in the old days." answered the
defendant. Then Judge Fritz went into
a trance. He recalled that Judge Con-
Ian also called Sacramento his birth
place and that the latter's father had
run the Capital Hotel. Simpson had
come Into the wrong court for tender
memories of childhood, and to-day will
be sentenced to do a sojourn at the
County Jail.
Hugh Higgins came up for sentence
in Judge Cabaniss' court yesterday.
Twice he had invaded the home of his
wife on Natoma street, the meager
comforts of which. were created by her
own care and indulgence, and tried to
wreck the household when he over
indulged in drink. On the first occasion
Judge Cabaniss sentenced him to fif
teen days in the County Jail. These
he served with due vigilance, and when
released he proceeded to renew his
iconoclastic work. Judge Cabaniss
gave him sixty days in the same resort
on this latest occasion. As the defend
ant left the court room he requested
the Judge to make due legal provision
when he had served the sentence, as
he wished to' be protected against a
disturbance of the peace on the part
of his wife. "With the greatest pleas
ure," said Judge Cabaniss in his suav
est tones. "My commitment to-day
assures you absolute peace from your
wife for sixty days. At the end of
that time If you are brought before
me again on a similar charge I shall
put you in a place for six months
where your wife cannot possibly inter
fere with you unless she breaks down
the doors of the cell. Adios."

cording to their testimony, are on Hen
rietta street, and the three of them

JURY ACQUITS
ACCUSED WOMAN
Juvenal says in one of his time-over
powering satires that a man who is
tricked once is a fool. The second time
he Is tricked he is a scoundrel. There
Is a team at the Orpheum doing a
stunt at $11,000 a week or some such
figure, in which the woman performer
uses the same language. So down
through the ages trickles the wisdom
of the writers. Judge Mogan, who has
not read Juvenal since his college days,
had a case yesterday in which the com
plaining witness had been bunkoed for
the third time. His name was A. Ar
luck, which will naturally suggest
"hard luck." He runs a grocery store
at 1425 Fifteenth street, and had hired
a solicitor named William Robin.
Twice the solicitor, according to his
own admissions, sequestered the goods
of the complaining witness, tied the
horse and .wagon to a convenient lamp
post and decamped with the proceeds.
On the third occasion of this unseemly
behavior the complaining witness had
the defendant arrested. The case will
"Beware of the man of one book"!
says Aristotle, the pioneer philosopher
and vegetarian. Policeman Joy does
not read Greek in its raw Btate,
so he disregarded the warning of
Aristotle and attempted to arrest
Julian Bonnetta because a man named
Davis told him that the defendant
had assaulted him with * a knife.
Bonetta appeared in Judge Fritz's
court yestorday to explain his re
sistance to the due process of the
law. He naively explained that
when he had drunk a little good wine
he was given to tell, in his own compo
sition, the tales of his own, loved Cor
slcan hills. He said the policeman had
made a mistake. When he was arrest
ed, he said, he was depicting to a de
lighted audience of Italians, in a Ho
meric hymn, the tortures of a wronged
lover. So strong, said he, was the dra
matic fervor that permeated him that
when Officer Joy appeared to arrest
him he thought he was a bandit from
the mountains and struggled with hi:n
so vigorously that the policeman was
compelled to club him Into subjection.
Prosecutor Louis Ferrari, from the
District Attorney's office, gave the de
fendant an excellent character. After
the Prosecuting Attorney had talked
with him the prisoner produced a copy
of the "Divina Commedia," nearly every
word of which he knew by heart. So
much knowledge was a vindication for
anybody. When the weary grind of the
court room procedure was over Judg*
Fritz had Bonnetta out of the dock to
sing for him. Like Homer, whom seven
cities owned after his death, the mus
tached prisoner sang the glories of
George Washington, the judiciary and
the laws of the United States. Judge
Fritz thought that San Francisco
should. have an exclusive claim on Bon-'
netta, so he told him to go out and
work, admonishing him to declaim as
little as possible to the disturbance of
the peace and quietude of others. Pros
ecutor Ferrari assured the court that
the prisoner could get a job at once, as
he was a thoroughly reliable man.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Judge Mogan has under consideration
the case of the bailiff who turned on
the heaters of the^court room yesterday
morning and closed all the windows
while a hot sun was pouring through.
Under the stress of public business, the
Judge dropped perspiration all over his
blotters and after an hour of travail he
discovered the cause of his trouble.
Then he ordered all the windows open
and the heaters shut off. He will re
quire several days to look up the laws
of the Justinian code and the Spanish
inquisition to find some fitting sentence
for the bailiff whose blood grew cold
and old under the sunlight. When the
Judge discovers the proper remedy, a
grinning head on the guillotine during
the French revolution or an unfaithful
Turkish woman, drowned with her
gown wrapped tightly about her throat,
will be a picture of merriment compaf"
ed to the punishment he will mete out
to the bailiff.

FEED HER RIGHT
The Sure .Way to Hear a Healthy
Look in each package for. a copy of
the famous little book, "The Road to
WelH'Ule."
"I have had numbers of my scholars
try the food and I must tell you about
one case. She was a puny, nervous lit-
tle girl, and her mother told me she
did not eat enough to keep a bird
alive. All she wanted was candy and
other trash. When I told her mother
about Grape-Nuts food she followed
my advice and its effect upon this
child, shown in the awakened energy
of the body and mind, was simply won-
derful. â¢ Her school work became en-
tirely satisfactory and she gained In
4 bodily strength. lost all her nervous-
ness and soon became a rosy, .chubby
younK miss." Name given by Postum
Co., Battle Creek, MJch. -
There's a reason.
"About that time I read ah article
about Grape-Nuts that convinced me
that my trouble was due to Indigestion,
something I had never thought of be-
fore. I sot two boxes of Grape-Nuts
and began to use them for breakfast
and supper with good rich cream. Well,
the change was something wonderful
and my "health came back In bounds.
"Grape-Nuts took the place of non-
nourishing food and I am now better in
health, brain power and spirits; sleep
â¢well and work longer and harder and
never fe^l nervous or worried. When I
have finished my school session. I still
feel I have lots of reserve foree and
energy left, and when I go to bed at
night I get sound and refreshing sleep
and fret up early, happy as a lark.
The relatron of food to comfort and
health Impressed an Iowa teacher, who
eays: <:cv.
"After teaching echool* for several
years I became* a victim of Insomnia,
and night after night it was 3 or 4
o'clock in the morning before I would
fall asleep, completely worn out. Of
course I lost strength and' brain power
and became terribly nerfous until I
was on the verge of nerwous prostra-
tion.

The police are inclined to think that

and is said to owe several small bills.
He was drinking to some extent on
Saturday.

EUREKA, Nov. 23.â Fred A- Pooler,
who has been peddling salmon about
the city at cut rates, is missing and
foul play is suspected. He was last
seen Saturday night. at about 8 o'clock
with' his cart, selling his fish. The cart
was found outside of his fish house on
the Buhne wharf. The key was in the
door. Everything gave the appearance
that something interrupted his putting
up his cart.
Mrs. Leaddart. his sister, is firm in
her belief that Pooler has been made
way with, as she claims his life had
been threatened by certain ones among
those with whom he was competing.
His sister remonstrated with him
against going to. his fish house on the
water front at night. He replied that
he was not afraid as long as he was
armed.

ing Saturday near the mouth of Red

and are supposed to have drowned.
The report of .the accident was
fcrought to Orick by Frank Hufford,
who accompanied Savage and Jewell on
their trip. He, however, did not leave
the shore with his companions when
they pulled their light skiff into the
stream. The current was very swift
end the two men in the boat were un
able to make any headway against it.
Finally the struggling men gave up
their attempt to battJe wlih the current
and the boat and its occupants were
carried out to tea, leaving llubbard to
Â¦witness the sad plight of his friends.
Searching parties have been sent out
since the accident was reported, but
have found no traces of the missing

have capsized and that the two men
\irre drowned.
LAWSUIT IS BEGUN
FOB A LABGE ESTATE
Belatives Allege Fraud in the Mak
ing cf the Bridget McDermott
Will.
REDWOOD CITY, Nov. 23.â A con
test over the $100,000 estate of the late
Bridget McDermott has begun before
Judge Buck at this place.
In May of this year an alleged will
of the deceased was produced by Mary
Anne Hums, a niece of Mrs. McDer
m!tt. by the terms of which she is
given all of the deceased's property,
with the exception of 57500. which is
bequeathed to a young man named
John J. Faunen, who has been residing
â¢with the McDermotts for the past fif
teen year?. A nominal sum of $1 is
left to each of two brothers and other
relatives. These brothers and rela
tives are contesting the will, alleging
fraud in Its making. While Bridget
McDermott had the faculty of making

Captain Forbes of the British ship
Duchalburn, which arrived yesterday
from Antwerp, reports that on Sun
day he saw what might have been a
two-masted steam vessel ashore on the
Farallones. His view of the object was
not the clearest, however, and the skip
per thinks his eyes may have been de
ceived into taking the steep and ragged
rocks of the Island for a vessel. There
Is nothing due or overdue correspond
ing with Captain Forbes' description of
what he took for a wreck. The Weath
er Bureau cable to the Farallones went
out of commission during Sunday night
but was working all day Sunday and
it la hardly likely that a wreck visible
as far off shore as lay the Duchal
burn's course would have escaped the
r.otlce of the people stationed on the
Islands. As no word was received of
any vessel In trouble It is almost cer
tain that Captain Forbes was mis
taken.

Mariposa Arrives.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's liner Jlar
lpoÂ«a arrived yesterday from Tahiti on eche
dule time and as usual looking like a well
kept yacht. Among her pasÂ«engÂ«rs were a
number of Honolulu people who went from the
islands to Tahiti and are making the return
trip by way of San Francisco. They speak
in glowing terms of the climate of Tahiti and,
accustomed to tropical delights as their resi
dence In the Hawaiian group has made them,
they found rr.uch that was new and delight
ful* on the other tropical isle. Of their stay
at Papeete, of the days spent exploring Tahiti
and of the smokeless, sootless trip to the
mainland en the well appointed MaripoAa, they
talk or ai something new and worth while in
the outing line. J. Sumner was in charge of
the Honolulu party.
The Marlpona brings little news from "IWii
tl. where everything is quiet. The weather at
Papeete was exceptionally fine during the
Mariposa's stay and the liner's officers report
that from a commercial standpoint tbe tropi
cal port is prospering.
The boatswain and his mate, ringleaders of
the mutiny on the French bark Sully, were
sentenced to Imprisonment in terms of twelve

and took the bark to Papeete. The boatswain
and boatswain's mate were the only ones
punished, but the captain was relieved from
duty and the Sully is at Papeete awaiting the
arrival of a new skipper.
The plague, which for a time raged in New
Caledonia, has been suppressed and French

MARION, Ind., Nov. 23.â Burglars en
tered the home of John Shippey, a lum

to cut off the fingers of his daughter

Rev. Mr. Pullman was a brother oÂ£ the

Chicago was lower on large receipts of Hogs
and lower prices at the yards. There was no
change here.
The Chicago report of Bolton. De Ruyter &
Co. eays: "Hog receipts were quite large
and considerably in excess of last year. Prices
at the yards were also less. This made some
8ellin!? pressure and while there are no Indi
cations that packers are disposed to market
products freely, they are. on the other hand,
making no effort to sustain prices. Scalping
trade is rather bearish. The distributive de
mand is good. Receipts of hogs are liable to
be liberal for the week and we are inclined
to think it will be a good week in which to
buy." *

also dull and weak early in the day and this
fact was a bear Influence on prices here. The

factor and with light receipts there the early
loss was quickly regained. The market re
ceived some Fuprort from a prominent local
operator, â¢ who bought ireely of both December
and May deliveries, but toward the end of the
Emission trading became decidedly dull and May
ranged between 78 Uc and 7K%<g7S!4c and
closed V^felic lower at 78-%@78%c.
The sentiment in the corn pit was bearish
and there was some Felling early in the day
on thiÂ» large world's shipments and the unsat
isfactory condition of the cash and export busi
ness although traders in general were not in
clined to sell much, owing to the small receipts
and the report of Fmall country offerings. De
cember closod Y*c lower at 42%c.
The feature of trading in oats was the sell
ing of May by commission houses, which caused
a weak market. December closed %c lower at
24 %c.

ceipts of hogs, with a decline of from 10c to 15c

Turkeys were the leading feature of the
Poultry market, receipts of all other descrip

Twenty-four tons of dressed Turkeys came in.
and fine large birds, which were scarce, sold
off well and occasional sales were rer>orted at

sisted chiefly of small and thin stock and
ferae very poor and scrubby lots were sold
below the quoted rates. Most dealers are firm
in their views and expect a scarcity of large
fat stock for the Thanksgiving trade. Receipts,
of Oregon stock will undoubtedly be light, aa
supplies In that State are belns shipped to
Seattle and other Puget Sound ports.
Game arrived freely and the bulk of- the re

give returns" is sufficient to tell the person who has a want of any kind
all that he or she wants to know. When we assure you that you can fill
your want, be it what it may. we mean what we say. We base our asser-
tion on the experiences of those who have used them.

The single rate->pn letters from the
United States to Great Britain Is 5
cents for each half . ounce. If this Is
not paid In advance there is a charge
of double the deficiency, collected on

said, also, that the foregoing penalty
is exacted on all correspondence in the
Postal Union malls.
The British Foreign Office has re

scrutiny of malls from the United

the matter more especially to the at

San Francisco had a little touch of
thunder and lightning yesterday morn

Without doubt the grill of the Lick
House, fashioned under the direction of
the proprietor, Mr. George W. Kings
bury, whose years of experience have
excellently fitted him to judge of the
needs and comforts of his guests, is one
of the handsomest and most inviting of
any place of its character on the coast.
The old Dutch style of architecture has
been chosen as best contributing to the
Ideas of the proprietor, whose chief mo
tive has been to provide a dining-room
that at once appeals to the artistic taste
of the patrons as well as caters to their
gastronomic sense. The walls and ceil
ing are papered in a deep red. set oft with
dark Flemish oak wood-work, that con
trasts most favorably and produces a
harmonious color effect. The tables and
chairs, the latter being the high back
cane-seated type, conform to the general
style. Three separate entrances, one
through the . hotel office for men, one
through the reading-room for ladies, and
still another from Lick, place giving a
short cut from either Post or Sutter
streets to Kearny-street patrons, all
together form a feature , of convenience
not found in any other dining-room in
town. The place has been undergoing
preparations for several weeks and every
detail of the service has been made per
fect. Before the plans were perfected
the steward, one of the most competent
in the business, toured ; the â¢ East in
search of the most modern ideas and ap
pliances, and under -his direct manage
ment and the general supervision of Mr
Kingsbury patrons. may well *be assured
of securing the best meal a la carte to
be had in town. , .
Amid a profusion of flowers and the
glare of countless electric bulbs in dain
tily formed electroliers, the guests of the
new grill of the Lick House were intro
duced to San Francisco's latest creation

The farewell letter mentioned the
names of two prominent citizen* of San
Francisco whom the author accuses of
having treated him badly, and to Bave
them from unenviable publicity the
stenographer refused to disclose the
full text of the ante-mortem communi
cation.
During the dictation the visitor wept
copiously and when the letter was fin
ished and paid for he pocketed it, walk
od out of the office and disappeared.
Then the stenographer notified the po
lice of the occurrence and gave them a
description of the despondent inebriate.
He is about 60 years of age, respectably
attired, has gray whiskers and hair, is
about five feet eight inches In height

the contemplated act of self-destruc
tion and pleaded inability to continue
the struggle for existence as the cause.

2. To lower the grade at Golden Gate
avenue and Leavenworth street, now
established at 59 feet, by 13 feet, and
establish at 46 feet.
The proposition to reduce the grade
on Golden Gate avenue Is now in the
hands of a committee of property own
ers, who will report its desire In the
matter to the Supervisors' street com
mittee this afternoon.
Grades were ordered established at
certain polnt3 on Parnassus avenue,
Lotta, South Brcderick, Gordon and
Tilden streets and Park Hill avenue.
The roadways of Bryant street, be
tween Nineteenth and Twentieth
streets, and Twentieth street, between
Bryant and York streets, were fully ac

An ordinance was passed to print re
ducing the width of sidewalks In the

19 feet to 15, and reducing the sidewalk
widths on the southerly side of Six
teenth street, between Illinois and Sev
enth streets, from 15 feet to 8 feet; also

The. Board of Works was authorized
to expend $2125 for the construction of
a bituminous rock pavement on Du
pont street, between Pacific street and
Broadway.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
submitted a recommendation to the
Board of Supervisors that It would be
to the public Interest to change the
grade on Golden Gate avenue, at its in
tersection with Jones and Leaven worth
streets, as follows:
1. To lower the gradâ¢ at Golden Gate
avenue and Jones street, now estab
lished at 43 feet by 11 feet, and estab
lish at 37 feet.
Lane also advised the Board of Su
pervisors that It has power to pass a
proposed ordinance restricting the
operation of cleaning machines and
engines on the. sidewalks and other
public places. Lane says that the
board's jurisdiction over such public
places can hardly be questioned, and
under ; the police power vested in the
board by the State Constitution and
the charter, it has the right to legislate
upon such subjects.
The report of the Judiciary Commit
tee that the ordinance is discriminating
and therefore invalid because it ex
empts machines used on public work
from its provisions, resulted in the ref
erence of the measure again to the City
Attorney, with a request that he ad
vise as to Its" constitutionality.
The petition v of the San Francisco
Labor Council that the ordinance
granting permission to Archbishop
Riordan, as president of St Mary's
Help Hospital, to maintain a spur
track on Filbert and Sansome streets
to connect with the belt road be re
pealed, was referred to the Street Com
mittee. The petitioner states that two
years have elapsed since the passage
of the ordinance > and, the grantee
thereof has failed to exercise the privi
lege which the Labor Council declares
will be prejudicial to the interests of
the Brotherhood of Teamsters and
kindred organizations.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion
yesterday in which that official holds
that the Board of Public Works has
the power, if It sees fit, to Increase the
wages of laborers in the employ of the
city. The opinion is the outcome of a
petition from the Laborers' Protective
Union requesting an Increase of labor
ers' . wages from 52.50 to. $3 per day.
The opinion says:
"The. charter fixes the minimum
wage for laborers in the service of the
city at $2 per day, but also confers
power on the Board of Works to fix
the compensation of workmen under
Its control. Pursuant to power con
ferred upon the Board pf Supervisors,
it passed an ordinance providing that
the minimum wages of laborers shall
be $2.50 per day. Such action of the
Supervisors in so confining their leg
islation to the minimum wage left
room for action by the Board of .Works.
"The Board of Supervisors has
merely fixed the minimum wage and it
Is still within the power of the Board
of Works â¢ to Increase the wage. In
so doing there would be no violation
of the ordinances of the Supervisors
nor of the charter."
The ordinance prohibiting the bribery
of police officers and fixing the penalty
for violations at $500 or by imprison
ment at six months was finally passed.
The amended ordinance regulating
the maintenance of shooting galleries
so as to permit the Golden Gate Club
to maintain an indoor range within the
city limits for the purpose of holding
revolver contests was re-referred to the
Judiciary Committee for the purpose
of redrafting it.
The Board of Work was requested
to inform the board what action, if
any. had been taken regarding the re
quest for a report on the safety of
buildings in Chinatown submitted
three months ago.
Supervisor Corrite presented a resolu
tion asking the Election Commission
to explain why the election booths are
not being removed from the sidewalks,
but withdrew the resolution when he
was informed that the delay was
caused by the necessity of the erection
of a suitable warehouse In which to
store the booths. .."
The board directed the Spring Valley
Company to furnish, not later than
January 5, 1904, an inventory of all Its
properties actually used In supplying
its consumers with water.
The Board of Works was requested
to furnish, not later than February 1.
1904, an appraisement of the properties
of the Spring Valley Water Company
for the purpose of fixing the water
rates thereon.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
took preliminary steps toward the fix
ing of the water rates for the next
fiscal year by adopting: a resolution
calling: on the Spring Valley Water
Company and othjt concerns or per
sons supplying water to the inhabit
ants of this city to furnish statements
regarding their financial operations
and showing the amount of money
actually expended annually since com
mencing business, and also their gross

The petition of the Pacific States Tel

"I have had doctors preach to me
that when a man is sick and they know
that he Is going to die that It Is mercy
to hasten the end and put him out of
misery. Man's life is God's, and It is
his right to say when that man shall
forfeit his life. I don't know whether
there are many murders committed In
this way, but it is murder. If a man
is to die and the physician thinks that
he has but a week' to live, let it be
left to God to eay when he shall die.
That. week that. he. has to live may
be the salvation of his soul. We look
on the priest and, nurse as ministers to
the body. You nurses take care of the
body and we of the bouL . - ; .
"We feel a kinship because as. long
as soul and body are united- we min
ister together. Be true to your motto,
'virtue alone ennobles.' When you go
home from a case that has caused you
many sleepless nights, if you have re
ceived no thanks for your I work, you
have the knowledge 'that. th?re is one
who has . appreciated that you have
done your duty."' ,:.'., Â¦,
"No one knows better than the priest
the untiring devotion that the nurses
and doctors put into their work. Life
is Bacred. Man's life is God's. Man
has no right to commit suicide, has no
right to take his own life any more
than he has the right to take another's,
unless that other has shown that he
has no right to his life.
"The Catholic church looks upon the
trained nurse and physician as apostles.
Your motto is a .grand one, 'Virtue
alone ennobles.' Virtue in its wide
sense means devotion to duty. Any one
that does not fulfill his duty as a man
has no virtue. The soul is the greatest
that is in man. The priest is the min
ister to the soul; the physician the
minister to the body.
"The physician knows that the con
dition of the mind has a great deal to
do with the success of his treatment of
the body. He knows that the priest is
able to give to the sufferer* a peace of
mind that materially assists in the pa
tient's recovery.
"There Is a kinship between the
nurse, the physician and the priest.
You nurses have a very well defined
course before you. Nursing is a pro
fession almost as distinctly defined as
that of a physician. The physician
knows well that a part of his success
is due to the faithful work of the nurse
assisting him.
"If I "Were King," a barytone solo,
was sung by S. Homer Henley in a rich,
voluminous voice. Mr. Henley's effort
was received with so much applause
that he was compelled to render an
encore. He was very ably accompanied
by his brother, Charles Henley.
Archbishop Montgomery ' presented
the young women with their diplomas
and then made an address. In part
he said:
The programme was opened by an in
strumental quartet, composed of the
following named: Flute, J. E. Hax;
'cello, H. Bruenn; violin, H. Seekamp;
piano, Mrs. H. Seekamp. Miss L. Hack
melster, accompanied by Miss L. Ryder,
rendered a vocal solo in fine voice. Dr.
T. E. Bailly of St. Mary's Hospital
made a few remarks on the training of
nurses, their studies, the disagreeable
nature of their work and their untiring
thirst for medical learning.
A violin solo by Nathan Landsberger
was then ably given. Following the
violin solo Dr. George Childs McDon
ald, visiting surgeon to the hospital,
delivered a talk on "Nursing, Past and
Present."
The Maple room was prettily dec
orated with greens and the claes sat
beneath their motto, "Virtus eola nobil
itas" (virtue alone ennobles), strung
In large letters across the end of the
room. The programme was an excel
lent one. At its close, when the young
ladles were given their diplomas, the
audience greeted them with great ap
plause. Dr. Charles D. McGettigan pre
sided.

County Clerk A. B. Mahony and his
former chief deputy, John J. McGrath,
have settled the lawsuit in which, they
were principals, and each of them
claims to be perfectly satisfied with the
outcome of the dispute. Mahony gets
$1000 for his interest in the Golden Gate
Bottling Works and McGrath has en
listed a nevr partner in the enterprise.
The case was interesting as a revela
tion of how affairs have been managed
In the County Clerk's office. McGrath
was a blacksniith when he and Mahony
purchased, for 53750, an interest in the
bottling works, each of them putting in
the sum of J1S75. To obtain his share
of the purchase price, Mahony borrow
ed $850 from John E. Macdonald, a
money-lender, on a note which Mc-
Grath indorsed. A couple of months
later McGrath was appointed Mahony's
chief derutv, at a salary of $200 a
month. That was in January last, and
lor eight months McGrath held the offi
cial Job and also acted as manager of
the bottling works. Then he was re
tired for Inattention to duty and soon
afterward Mahony began suit for an
accounting of the affairs of the bottling
works and the appointment of a receiv
er. The case was assigned to Superior
Judge Hebbard's court and on October
12 an injunction was issued to re-
Ftraln McGrath from conducting the
business. Two days later John E. Mac
donald, the man who loaned the money
to Mahony. was appointed receiver and
on October SO McGrath appealed
from the order of appointment and kept
the receiver out by giving a bond. Then
began the negotiations for an amicable
pettlement, which were consummated
Saturday morning.
Mahony's attorney In the case was J.
A McKenna, a deputy county clerlt,
and Alexander McCuiloch was Mc-
Grath's legal adviser. The papers in
the case were kept in concealment un
til yesterday, and In explanation of
that (act Mahony said that he did not
want to have the suit made public un
til his Interest in the bottling works
had been disposed of. as he was afraid
publicity might interfere with a con
templated saie.
McGrath says that every cent of sal
ary he drew for his deputyshlp went
into the bottling business. The United
Brewers hold a $2000 mortgage on the
( stablishroent.
