As the two men left the room the
orderly entered it once more and an
nounced to the general that a lady was
below who asked the privilege I of an
Interview with him. .
'-'Lady? What lady?" demanded
Beauregard Impatiently..
He waa in no mood for feminine so
ciety; after the difficult; Interview in
which-he had Just participated. '
"I I think : it is Miss Glen, sir. . She
says she must see you ; andâ '.'..
Â¦â¢ V "Ah ! ". interrupted . the '; general hast
ily as he Â¦ reco-riected the scene: on; c the
wharf; the night "before,- when; Fanny
Glen had' fainted at . the news that the
boat was gone and that Lacy had gone
with it. "Show her in here at once,
orderly." ; - , ; .â¢ Â¦>: -. . -.
He had intended to , seek her in her
house in the course of the morning
CHAPTER IX.
The general was always on the alert
and usually began his work with the
sun and rarely did he stop with the
setting of it, either. The next morn
ing therefore he was at his headquar
ters at an unusually early hour. For
tune had favored him in that one of
the harbor patrol boats, making a dar
ing reconnolsance about midnight to
discover if poslble what had happen
ed to. the David H had captured a
whaleboat from one of the Union
ships, bound on a similar errand, and
had brought her crew to the city. .By
questioning them Beauregard learned
of the blowing up of the Housatonic
and the almost certain loss of the tor
pedo-boat. He was sorry- that ..he
missed the .Wabash and the admiral,
and intensely grieved over the lack of
any tidings from the David or her
men, which, however, caused him lit
tle surprise, but he was glad, Indeed,
they had been so brilliantly successful
In eliminating the magnificent new
steam 6loop-of-war Housatonic from
the force blockading them.â
Incidentally he learned, with some
additional satisfaction, that Admiral
Vernon was to be relieved of his com
mand on account of illness and was
going North K with his . flagship in a
few days. The admiral had shown
himself bo intensely enterprising and
pugnacious that Beauregard hoped
and expected that_ any change in op
ponents would be for the betterment
of the situation from the Southern
point of view.. -When he had digested
the Important news of the morning he
sent for his prisoner of the night be
fore. The general had been very In
dignant on the wharf, and Justly so,
A STUBBORN PROPOSITION.
CHAPTER VIII.
"I am sorry to. say that In all proba
bility he has lost his life In the torpedo
boat. -We. can get no tidings of her or
of any of her crew. She must have gone
down with the ship." . â¢
"Did they succeed, sir?" Interrupted
Glen, with an anxiety and an
apprehension too great to be controlled.
â¢ "They did," returned Beauregard,
somewhat surprised at her j question,
"but : the â¢ torpedo-boat, I think, went
down with the ship she blew up, and
no one has seen her or any of her crew
since the explosion. I knew that It was
almost certain death to them.".
Fanny Glen" "sank back In' the chair.
She almost lost consciousness in her
agony. She murmured strange and in
coherent' words. . The generai- did not
understand them; but he rose, came to
her < side, - bent over her and t took her
â¢hand; patting it softly.
: "I know, 1 know, my dear child," he
Bald gently, "how you must suffer.
Many another woman has had to give
up her heart's desire for our beloved
country. Think of the service he ren-
and break the melancholy news to her
that the . torpedo-boat was lost In all
probability with all on board, for from
her agitation on the wharf he inferred
that her affections were bestowed upon
Â«Lacy. He was very sorry for her, of
course, but knowing Lacy as he
had, and estimating Fanny Glen aa he
did, there was a certain sense of re
lief that she /would not be condemned
to a lifetime 'of misery which -such a
marriage would inevitably have en
tailed. Still he pitied her ; profoundly,
and he pitied her more when she came
into his private ohice in the wake of
the orderly arid threw back her veil.
Her beautiful face showed the sorrow
under which she labored. Suffering
had thrown a blight upon it, the fresh
ness and. youth seemed to have depart
ed, from it. She was a piteous little
spectacle indeed.
.The general received her with the
utmost cordiality and consideration.
He handed her to a chair, and bade the
orderly see that they were not dis
turbed on any account.
"Miss Fanny," he began gentlyâ the
war had' brought the general and the
brave girl very close together â "I was
coming over to see you in a little while.
You have shown yourself a brave little
woman many times. You need all your
courage now."
"Yes, general," said the girl faintly,
"I know."
. "You have sustained a terrible loss."
"Isâ Isâ Mr. Semplandâ"
I VHe is well enough at present. I refer
to your friend, Major Lacy."
"Is heâ "
/ . - Â¦ Â¦ . . â¢ â¢.'-.''.
tainly, death.: For In the face. of your
; refusal to explain I can do nothing
more for you^' , * ,
; Sempland bowed to the inevitable.
"You have said," he began, "that you
did not belie. ve I was a. coward, nor a
.traitor, "if you will not allow the stlg
jna.'bt^elther, of these charges to rest
.upon me I will bear, with equanimity
'whatever punishment the court-martial
may award."
"Even to loss of life?"
"Yes, sir." ' . '
"Very well," said the general, shrug
ging his shoulders, a trick of his French
ancestry. "I have done my best, Mr.
Sempland, for you. As to my personal
beliefs I can and will express them, but
I cannot tell whether the court-martial
will receive them or no. Will nothing
move you?"
"Nothing, sir." . . â¢'
The general struck a bell on the desk
before him. ' , \j '
"Orderly," he said, as a soldier pre
sented himself, "my compliments to the
assistant adjutant general. *' Ask him to
come here. Ah, General, WyH^''- he said
as that functionary presented 'himself,
"will you make out an order' assembling
a court-martial to try Lieutenant Rhett
Sempland, here, for disobedience of or
ders and neglect of duty In the presence
of the enemy, andâ well, that will be
enough, I think," he continued after a
pause which was fraught with agony to
Sempland, at least, . lest the general
should mention cowardice or treason
again. "Meanwhile see that Mr. Semp
land Is carefully guarded here in the
headquarters building." .
"Very good, sir," said the officer, sa
luting. "This way, Mr. Sempland.".
"Thank God, thank God!" crlad tha
girl, and the relief In her voleÂ© and
face seemed to make another woman
of her. "It was wrong. I know. It
was treason to the South â I lovÂ» thÂ«
South â but I strove to preventâ'*
"Ah!" exclaimed Beau re jar d. "1
have It now! Semplandâ'*
"He is preparing." continued Beau
regard coolly â he had the clew to thÂ«
mystery and he determined to follow
It to the end â "to be tried by a, court
martial â "
"By a court-martial. General Beaure
gard! For what, sir?"
"For disobedience of orders and neg
lect of duty In the face of the enemy.
And I am in two minds whether to
these charges should) be added cow
ardlce and treason or not!"
"Impossible!" exclaimed Fanny
Glen.
"Miss Glen, It is an absolute fact.
He came to me yesterday afternoon
and volunteered for the command of
the expedition. Begging for it. In fact.
Major Lacy reluctantly but generously
yielded to him with my consent."
"It was for me he sought It," said
the girl full of reproach for herself
"I had mocked him for his lack oC4(ll3
tlnctlon. sir. before he saw you. He
hazarded his life for my approval and
for the cause of the South."
A fuller light broke upon the gÂ«J|
eral's mind. He understood all now,
yet he went on pitilessly.
"After getting command in this pe
culiar way he failed to present him
self on the wharf at the appointed
time. We waited ten minutes for him.
as long as we dared, in fact, and then,
as you know, sent the boat out under
Major Lacy."
"He was detained." said the girl
faintly.
"So he said when I arrested him
last night, and he repeated the state
ment this morning. I pressed him to
tell me by whom and where he had
been detained, but he refused to tell.
I plied him with. every argument at
my command. I pointed out to him
the consequences of his action, his
failure to justify himself, that Is,
showed him clearly the penalty which
the court-martial would undoubtedly
inflict upon him â "
"That is?'-'
"Death, madam! He will probably
bi shot to-morrow, for his guilt 1Â»
clear."
The girl's head fell forward in her
hands. There was a little silence In
the room. The general watched^Jier
narrowly, but said nothing further.
He was waiting, in full confidence that
she would speak. He could afford to |
be patient now. '*
- "-He Is. - Some Yankees we captured
this morning say that he is to be re
lieved of his command and ordered
North on- a sick leave. He will no
longer be in danger from us, you see."
"Oh!" cried the woman, throwing
back her head, are wrong. You
do not know, you do not understand,
I honored Major Lacy, I rejoiced in
his courage, but I do not love him.
It is not he that I think of. It Is my
father."
"Your father? What do you
"Admiral Vernon."
"Yes, he Is my father. My name Is
Fanny Glen Vernon." â¢
"Good heavens! It cannot be pos
sible."
"It is true. My mother was a South r
ern woman, one of the Glens of Hali
faxâ"
" "I knew her!" exclaimed Beaure
gard.
"She died when I was a child and I
was brought up by her sister. My
fatherâ I did not see much of him.
He was a sailor, and after my moth
er's death he sought constantly to be
in active service. When the war broke
out he said he must stay by the old
flag. I strove to persuade him dif
ferently. It was horrible to me, to
think that a son of South Carolina,
and my father, would fight against
her. There was a quarrel between us.
I told my father I would not ac
knowledge him any longer. I repudi
ated the Vernon name and came here
and worked for the South, as you
know. When I learned yesterday that
you were going to blow up the Wa
bash "
"But, my*dear girl," Interrupted the
general quickly, "we didn't blow Up
the Wabash."
"But you said that Major Lacy had
succeeded!" said the girl In great be
wilderment.
"He did. The Wabash and. Hou
satonic exchanged places during the
night and the latter was sunk. The
Wabash- is "all ; right. For your sake,
my dear child, I say thank God for the
mistake."
'Then my father is safe?"
dered, to you and to all of us! Think of
his noble sacrifice, his death! Cherish
his memory and be proud that he loved
you and that you loved him. Few wom
en have done more for the South than
you, and there is still much to do.
Work will assuage your grief," con
tinued the general, laying his hand ten
derly upon the bowed head. "You will
always have the deathless memory of
his heroism."
He was too far away to hear the ex
plosion of the torpedo, which was muf-
Suddenly there flashed into his mind
that there might be some one on the
Wabash whom she wished to protect!
Could that be the solution of the mys
tery? No one knew anything of ber
origin, her past history- Was she faith
ful to the South, yet had she a â a â lov
er in the Union fleet? Was she indeed
what he called herâ a heartless co
quette? He could have sworn frcm
that brief- moment when he held her in
his arms, when he looked at her, that
6he loved him. She had returned his
kiss. Oh, had 6he? "Was it a dream?
A play? To deceive him? Great God,
was he going rnad?
.Of only one thing was he certain.
He could never disclose to any one
the cause of his failure to present him
self on the wharf on time. Whether
she loved Lacy, or some one in . the
Union fleet, made no difference to his
love. He would love her till he died.
Ay, he would love her even 'in the
face of her treachery, her faithless
nessâeverything! He hated himself
for this, but It was true; he could not
deny it. â¢ â¢ i
And he would save her from the con
sequences of her action at the cost of
his life â his honor even. What had he
to live fW.any way if she were taken
from him? Death might come. It would
come. He would make no defense. It
was quite within the power of a court
znartial to order him shot. And it was
quite within the power of a court-mar
tial to punish Fanny Glenn, too, if he
fastened the culpability for his failure
upon her, perhaps not by death, but
certainly by, disgrace and shame. The
city was under martial rule-rGeneral
Beauregard was supreme. No. he could
not expose her to that condemnation
he loved her too welL Yet he wished
that he could hate her, as he paced up
and down the long room, stopping at
the windows to stare out Into the dark
,ln the direction of the seaâ where "he
Should have been if all had gone well.
Was she a traitor to the South? Did
ehe think to prevent the loss of the
flagship of the Federal fleet by de
taining him? That could not be, for if
ever truth and sincerity shone In a
woman's face and were evinced in a
woman's actions, they v|ere in Fanny
Glen's appearance and life. Her patri
otism was unquestioned. That hypoth
esis must be dismissed at once.
Was it because she loved him so
that, fancying the expedition promised
certain death to him, she had taken
this unfortunate method of preserving
his life? Had he not been too agitated,
in the strong room of her house to re
alize as he held her that in some mys
terious way she was happy, at being in
his arms? His heart leaped at the rec
ollection. She had not struggled. She
had almost nestled against him.
He could recall the clasp of her arms,
the kiss that Ehe had given him, the
words that she had said! He was al
most sure that she loved him as he
thought of these things. : ' .. ' .
Yetâ she had disgraced him, dishon
ored him! That was not. the act of a
loving woman. She had shown herself
possessed of a full measure of woman
ly heroism and courage. She knew
exactly what was involved in his fail
ure to carry out his orders. How could
she have done it! Was it all acting
then? Did her kisses betray him? Was
Ehe indeed e traitorâ and to him? Yet
for whom?
There was Lacyâ ch, had he repent
ed after all. Had he wished to resume
the command he had bo reluctantly
surrendered? Had she been a party to
any plan whereby the matter might be
brought about? Was he to be shamÂ«d
and sacrificed for Lacy's glory and
honor by this woman? Perish the
thought! Yet why had she fainted at
the wharf? Was it at the mention of
Lacy's name? Was she alarmed for
his safety? If that were the case why
had she not striven to restrain Lacy
and allowed him to go in his place?

f>r EMFLAND was utterly unable to
\O\ fathom her mysterious conduct.
Y) He had thought upon it swiftly
A^ as he could during those trying
moments which had been so filled with
action, but he had not had time, until
In the quiet and Bolitude of his con
finement, to give It any calm considera
tion. He was at a loss to understand
her actions.
With a misery akin to Sempland's
she heard the bombardment which pro
claimed that something had happened.
Had the flagship been blown up? Noth
ing was left to her. She would go to
the general and tell the truth In the
morning, and thenâ he would be free.
They could punish her and she could
die. Well, death would be welcome.
Poor little Fanny Glen! She had
played, and played the fool exceedingly
â and she had lost on every hand!
fled because It took place under the
water, but he could hear the batteries
of the ships as they opened on the
blockade runners and the answer .from
the forts, and he knew that something
had happened at any rate. And his
suspense as to that added to his wretch
edness. Lacy had supplanted him and
reaped the gloryâ again. It was mad
dening. No one came to bring him any
word. The general concluded to post
pone his inquiry until the next morning,
and Sempland paced the floor the night
long in a pitiable condition of .wounded
love, blasted hope, shattered fame.
At home not far away, poor Fanny
Glen was even more miserable than
Rhett Sempland, for she had divined
â yes, as soon as the two men had
left her presence the afternoon before,
she had recognized the factâ that she
loved Sempland. Conviction had grown
upon her swiftly, and in those mo
ments when she was fearful that he
would succeed In his purpose, when she
had kept him a prisoner in her home
to prevent him from taking out the
David to try to blow up the Wabash,
she knew that she loved him. When he
had held her in his arms, In that bold
and successful effort to escape, when
he had strained her to his breast, when
he had kissed herâ oh, that kiss!â the
consciousness of her passions over
whelmed her. The recollection of it
even filled her with passionate tender
ness. She had not been afraid when he
had threatened her with a pistol. She
could have died easily thenâ In his
arms, with his kiss upon her lips, his
heart beating against her own. He
loved her! Nothing else mattered for
the moment.
She had endeavored to keep him a
prisoner partly for his own sake, but
principally for another and greater
reason. &he had not thought of dis
grace or shame to him. It had all
come so swiftly. She had no time to
reflect at all. She had decided upon
impulse, with but one thought at first
âto save the Union ship. In'hersud r
den alarm and anxiety she had not re
alized that Bhe was playing a traitor's:
part. Or if she had, she had 'done it:
Vlllingly in the belief that the pun
ishment would fall upon her, and that
he would be held blameless.
But for whatever reason she had
acted as she had, she had failed after;
all, for another had: taken Sempland's
part and the flagship, if the David suc
ceeded, was doomed. Her sacrifice was
unavailing. She had lost everything.
Sempland' had shrunk away from her
when she had confronted him and the
general on the wharf, and when she
had recovered consciousness he was
gone* She could not know his heart had
gone out to her lying there and how
they had hurried him away from her
prostrate figure. He would never for
give her â never! she thought misera
bly. He was under/ arrest now. What
was that word she had caught as she
ran up? Coward! They would kill him
perhaps. She had lost allâ love, the
6hlp,.everything! Lacy, too, was gone.
He had taken the boat out in Semp
land's place. Why had she not thought
of that possibility? And he had. loved
her, and he would never come back.
"Unfortunately, no. One of them was
sunk. The other two returned insafe
ty. But all this Is beside the question.
We are losing- sight of the main. point
For the last time, will you tell me why
you, failed to be on hand?"
"General Beauregard, as I said, ,1
would rather be where Lacy is now
than have failed as I did, but 1 cannot
tell you what detained me.";
"For, the last time, Mr. Sempland, , I
beg of you to answer me. You know
the consequences?"
The general spoke sharply now. Such
determination and contumacy v had ; at
â¢last got; the better of his patience and
forbearance. ; He had tried . to ;Â¦Â¦' save
r Sempland, but ; the young officer would
"give him no assistance.- Well, on- his
own head it would be. . '
"You realize what Is before you, sir?"
"Yes, sir.",

answer," continued' Beauregard keen
ly scanning the face of the young. man
standing before him . in stubborn
silence. "I see that you are shielding
some one, sheltering some unworthy
person. Who is it?" .
Still no answer. The general's pa r
tience was gradually vanishing in the
face of such obstinacy. .Yet he re
strained his growing anger and contin
ued his questioning.
"Where did you go after you left
me?" Â¦ : ; .
"To my quarters, sir; to write a let
ter." â¢ ' - â¢
"Were you there all the time?"
"No, sir."
"Where did you go alter' the letter
was written?" ,
No answer.
"Major Lacy said" â .. began the
general, changing his tactics.
"Did he tell you?" cried Sempland in
sudden alarm and dismay.
"He knew, then?" exclaimed the gen
eral, triumphant in his clew. "No, he
didn't tell. He never will tell now. I
have learned from a. picket boat that
was captured last night by one of our
patrols that nothing was seen of the
David after the explosion."
"Poor Lacy!" said Sempland. "Well,
sir. he" died the death of his choice.'!
"Yes," said Beauregard. "Little in
life became him as the ending of it."
A little silence fell between the two
in the room.
"And I might have been there," said
Sempland at last.
"I had rather see you dead, sir, than
in your present case," commented the
general deftly. - .
w "Yes, sir, and I'd rather be there,"
returned the young man; "but Iâ I. beg
your pardon, general; were they suc
cessful?" ' '
"In a measure. They missed the Wa
bash, but they blew up the Housa
tonic." " '
"Did the cotton ships get out?"
fbut he lnVtinctlveTyleftlhat there was
.something In the situation which, if
he could get at It, might relieve from
the odium of his situation the young
ofncer, whose family history, no less
than his personal character, absolute
ly negatived the idea of cowardice or
treachery.
General Beauregard hoped that by
questioning him quietly and calmly
and by representing to him the dread
ful situation in which he found him
self, he might Induce him to clear
up the mystery. He spoke -to him
kindly, therefore, when he was usherrd
into the room and bade him be seated.
He- marked- with soldierly apprecia
tion of the lieutenant's feelings the
evidences of his sleepless night, the
anguish of his soul, in the haggard look
upon his face.
"Mr. Sempland,". he began with Im
pressive and deliberate gravity, care
fully weighing his â¢ words that they
. might make the deeper impression
upon the younger man, for whom he
felt profound â¢ pity, "you bear . one of
the noblest names, in the common
wealth. I knew your father' and your
grandfather. They were men^of the
highest courage and of unimpeachable
honor. .'Their devotion to the South
cannot be questioned. I grieve more
than I can say to find, you in so
equivocal' a . . position. I am convinced
that there is some explanation for it
â¢ aria I ask you, .not as your general,
but. as your friend, to disclose it to
me."
"You called me a coward last night,
sir."
"In the heat of my disappointment
and surprise I did make use. of. that
term, sir. It was a; mistake. '.;I ;re
gret it," said the general magnani
mously. "I do not believe your fail
ure to' take out the David arose. from
any fear."
This was a great 'concession indeed,
and Sempland was intensely- relieved
and an immense load was lifted, from
his breast by the general's reassuring
words. . . : ' y
"Sir, I thank you. I could have borne
anything than that." v Â¦â¢â¢,,;
"But, my boy,"; continued the gen- ;
eral, severely, "you remember you ntlil

readily that is a less terrible '
accusation than the other." 'Â¦'Â¦'..
"General Beavregard,"< believe me,

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU.
A LITTLE TRAITOR TO THE
SOUTH
2solved in his own mind firmly to dis
courage such efforts. He took a gloomy
view of life ana-of love and of wemenâ
do they not always go together in the
heart of youth? .There was nothing
now, therefore, for which he cared to
live. -Â¦â¢;/:
Yet If he could only see Fanny Glen
again! Why did she not send some one
to Inquire as to his whereabouts? At
least to ask after his welfare? She
must know he was under arrest. Why
could she net come herself? He was
sacrificing himself for her, to preserve
her freedom, ay, her honor and reputa
tion. She might not love him, but* at
least she might have manifested a~ de
cent interest In his fate. The barest
politeness ought to make a woman
take some thought for a man who
was about to be shot for her sake, he
thought bitterly. ; Â¦.; .
He would go to his grave silent, load
ing upon her the weight of an obliga
tion, from which she should never es
cape. When the war was over she
might marry that man on the Wabash
whom she bad been so anxious to save
that she had pretended love for him â
Sempland! Yes, he would be under ob
ligation, too, this Union sailor, for to
Sempland wculd be due his possession
of Fanny Glen.
â¢ The imprisoned Â¦ officer. - ground his
teeth in rage at that thought and
turned, suddenly, from the barred win
dow where he had been standing list
lessly looking down the bay toward old
Fort Sumter, knocked to pieces by
fierce bombardment, yet still flying the
Stars and Bars in brave defiance of the
ironclads far away, and, with clenched
hands, tirm set lips and troubled brow,
began pacing up and down the long
apartment. The moments dragged mis
erably. He wished they would assem
ble, that court-martial and have it over
with. He would not care what they
thetlc in the droop of the little figure,
In spite of the comforting thoughts
that had come to her, when the Â¦ girl
rose and followed the > soldier from the
room.
The general was almost persuaded to
call after her a reassuring word or
two, but restrained himself and said
nothing.

THIS TIME THE WOMAN PLEADS.
Lieutenant Rhett Sempland, under
arrest, in confinement, awaiting trial,
alone and unvisited by any one (which
meant Fanny Glen), felt that morning
within him. Tet. again and again this
proposition presented itself to him,
crushing his hope and breaking: his
heart: -How could a. woman who loved
a man, and a woman especially who
had become sufficiently conversant with
military affairs .through her hospital
service .and other experiences in -this
war to understand what she was doing,
have placed her lover in so dreadful a
position?
And most damnably crushing thought
of all, why had she not had the com
mon decency after all to come and see
him this morning? He was in trouble,
and he suffered for her sake. She must
know that, she must realize it. Why
did she give no sign of it? His loneli
ness and his craving to see her were
terrible. His desire to see her grew
with every ! passing , moment, he was
consumed by it: yet, he thought bitter
ly, to what purpose after all? Â¦ Â¦ â¢
"And .he did all this for you."
"He loves me, .as I .love him."
"But your love,has disgraced him. his
hps protected you.V
The girl shrank â¢ before' the stern
words e* the soldier.
"Yes." she said faintly, "it Is as you
say. I alone am to blame. Let mine
alone be the punishment. I will tell all
to the court. He must be cleared!";
"It is Just." said Beauregard. "You
have committed an act of treason
against the South. There is, however,
some excuse for your action, and your
previous record in the hospital service
has been such as to entitle you to every
consideration. I am disposed to be
lenient, but the offense Is one I cannot
condone. I will have to put you under
guard until I can consider what is best
to be done."
"I make no protest," said Fanny Glen.
"You will, of course, release Mr. Semp
land from arrest and see that his repu
tation takes no hurt?"
"I will attend to that"
He struck a bell again and sum
moned the assistant adjutant general
once more. Fanny Glen dropped her
veil so that her face was concealed
from the officer. He did not perceive
what she had suffered and was suffer
ing. Yet her heart was full of reliefâ
her father was safe, her lover would
be free â and. best of all, she had such
testimony as few women have received
to the depth and power of his passion.
ficed." -
"I supnose so. You are a man, you
cannot understand. I am a woman.
There were but two I loved on earth.
I was ashamed of ray father, but I
loved him. Four rears of war have
taught me other things. I am sorry
that he did not go with the South, but
it is rot for me to Judge him. I could
not fcÂ» him condemned to death and
rot raife a har.d to save him. And I
discovered too late that I â I â cared for
Mr. f-Vmnland. i drove him from me
in Emm and contemptâ I taunted him.
He sought that detail to prove his
courrsf: I could not let him go to cer
tain death. If he did it would be my
fault. I would have murdered him.
Pity me! I am only a woman. Try to
understand!"
"But the young man has proven his
courage â "
"I know. I know! I never doubted
It." she interrupted.
"By keeping silent this morning, by
facins certain death upon charges that
are worse than the punishment to a
soldier, in that they, blast his fame."
"Thank God ." for that kindness to
THE CONFESSION THAT CLEARED
"General Beauregard," she whispered
at last, "I am the traitor. He was de
tained by me."
"That doesn't excuse him," said the
general seveiely. "Any man who (ails
in his duty because he succumbs. to a
woman's wiles, even though that wo
man loves him. has no plea to urge in
justification. He is a soldier. His duty
to obey orders is first of all."
"Butâ butâ you don't understand. I
âIâ kept him there by force, sir. Ma
jor Lacy told me of the expeditionâ he
and Mr. Sempland had called upon me
in the afternoon. Theyâ they had each
of them asked meâ inâ marriage. Weâ;
we quarreled. Mr. Sempland left me in
anjer. Major Lacy divined that Iâ Iâ
cared for Mr. Sempland. He came back
later in the evening and told me Mr.
Sempland was going to blow up the
Wabash, and he begged me to see Mr.
Sempland again and bid him good-by.
I had only two thoughtsâ that it meant
certain death to my father and possibly
Mr. Semplandâ the manâ Iâ What
was I to do? I might have sacrificed
myself by letting Mr. Sempland run the
risk, but my father, sir "
She stopped and looked at him in pit
iful entreaty.
"Go on," said the general inflexibly.
'"I had Mr. Sempland ushered into
the strong room of the house â the old
Rennie house, you know, sir?"
The general nodded.
"The door was locked on him after
he entered. My three negro boys kept
watch outside. There was no escape
for him. He beat and hammered on
the door until his hands bled. He
begged and implored to be released. It
was agonizing to hear. I did not real
ize that he was telling the truth when
he said he was being dishonored. I
had no time to consider anything. Â¦- 1
only thought of my fatherâ helpless on
that great thip â the sudden rush of
that awful little boat."
"You were a traitor to the South!"
said General Beauregard coldly.
"Yes. God pity me, I see it now," an
swered the girl.
"How did he get away? Did you re
lease him?" continued the general.
"He swore that he would kill him
self if I did not open the door."
"Did you open it?"
. "Yes."
"Then did he burst through you and
the men?"
"No. They were armed and would
have Jcilled him." He could not have
made his escape that way. He begged
me to speak to him alone for a mo
ment. I weht into the room and shut
the door. He seized me in his arm
and put his pistol to my head, threat
ening: to ki!l me if I did not order the
door opened."
'"And you obeyed?"
"No. I refused. Then he called out
to the slaves to open at once or he
would kill me. their mistress."
"What happened then?"
"I ordered them not to open the door,
to let me die. But they did as he said.
He made them leave the hall. They
obeyed him in spite of my protests.
Then he threw me aside and ran to the
wharf. I followed after. The rest you
know. It was useless after all. I
thought no one would go if he did not.
1 thought if I could detain him a night
âpet some delayâ I would come here In
the morning and tell you the truth and
ask rou to spare my father."
"Miss Glen." said the little general.
"I would not spare my own father if
my duty demanded that he be sacri-
He loved her, indeed. There was a Joy
in that thought that set her heart'beat-
ing. The general drew his subordinate
into a corner of. the room, where they '
conversed earnestly far a few moments,
Then they came back to the young girl,
"Adjutant General Wylie," said the
commander-in-chlef,' "you will take
charge of Miss Glen. You will fol-
low him. Miss Glen. I will communi-
cate my further plans wjthin an hour." ;
There was something-Intensely pa-
as if he had indeed "'lost everything.
He had been certain at first that Fan-
ny Glen had returned his swift, lm-
pulsive caress in the strong room
even in the peculiar circumstances
under which he had bestowed it upon
her, and he had therefore naturally
Inferred ithat she loved him. Indeed,
when he thought of the look in her
eyes when he strained her to his breast,
although^he had the pistol pointed at
her forehead, the conviction was strong
â¢ Well, there was no use in worrying or â¢
speculating any longer. Itjeyould all be
over soon now. He was sufficiently ex-
perienced as a soldier to know what
would happen to him. There was only
one possible \-erdict, only one punish-
ment for the crimes with which he was
charged. When ! he was sentenced
to' death his friends would un-
doubtedly move heaven and earth to
get President Davis to mitigate or com-
mute his punishment; but he was re-

should come at the last moment, r'.ie
would find him as cold as ice. as m
different as a Laodicean! He would
show her that he appreciated at its
true value not only her heinous con
duct, but her criminal neglect as well,
He would make her understand that It
was not love for her that kept him
silent. Oh, no! Simply the obligation
of a gentleman, a man of honor, albeit
a Quixotic one. Oh, noble resolution!
Being a martyr Is certainly a fine
thing, but the position loses half Its
charm unless people know it. To
complete her melancholy satisfaction,
heâ and . he considered himself the
martyr, not she â must recognize it.
If he would only turn and speak to
her. This silence. thi3 immobility, ou
his part, was unbearable. ; Â¦Â¦ Â¦
She coughed gently and took a" step
or two across the floor toward nan.
He gave no sign that he heard tter.
How cruel he was! So despotic, : so
determined, . so masterful! She abom
inated a masterful man! She coughed
again, and this time a little more em
phatically. Still no attention. It was
discouraging.
There was a small mirror upon the
wall of the room. Her eye) in accord
ance with an instinct feminine, fell
swiftly upon it. She lifted her veil
to see how far the experiences she
had gone through had affected her
most potent talisman.
"Heavens!" she thought, "what a
fright!"
To take off her hat was the work of
a moment. Her swift, subtle fingers
busied themselves with her rebellious
curls. Another glance reassured her a
little. She felt more confident. She
coughed again, but as before, hs did
not move.
"ZIr. Sempland," she said sof tly at
last In sheer desperation.
He turned on his heel as suddenly as
if he had been moved by a spring and
faced her. He had been longing for a
chance to recede from his position.
"Miss Glen," he answered with da
pressing coldness. .
"Youâ youâ don'tâ seem very glad
to see me, sir?"
The moment was one of great im
portance to both of them; their future,
the life and happiness of one, the honor
and good name of the other, depended
upon itâ so they thought at least. The
conversation accordingly began, as con
versations under such circumstances
usually begin, in trivialities.
"I am not," he answered shortly and
mendaciously as well.
"I suppose not. I noticed that youâ
your welcomeâ wasn't very cordial, I
am sure."
, "I didn't mean it to be."
"Why didn't you order me oat of your
There was something very attrac
tive, after all, in her possible martyr
dom which gave her not a little com
fort. She was surprised that Semplai.d
had not been immediately summoned
to the general's presence when she had
been put under guard. She supposed,
however, that the delay was due to
some military technicality, and sl)e
imagined that the next moment would
see him called from the room in her
presence. And she would be left
alone, most miserably, forlornJy alone
to face her fate.
did, he thought savagely. He was sick
and tired of the whole buslness-^-the
war, the South, General Beauregard.
Fanny Glen, everything, everybody!
Suddenly he heard footsteps, the clank
ing of a sword, a word or two ex
changed between the sentry and a new
comer In the corridor. Some one turned
the handle of the door. It was opened.
Sempland Instantly stood at attention,
then folded his arms with great dignity,
expecting, of course, to confront some
one sent to fetch him to the opening
session of the court. General Beaure
gard waa remarkable for his promptness
and celerity, and he had declared that
the young man should be tried imme
diately. He had wondered already at
the unnecessary delay. But no stern
featured, dignified official presented
himself, instead of which Sempland's
astonished gaze fell upon the small flg
jire of a woman!
The do^or vias instantly closed and
locked behind her without a word of
explanation from those outside, and the
two were alone in a locked room for the
second time In twenty-fpur hours.
There wes a difference in the situation
that morning, although the man did not
know it. On this occasion Fanny Glen
was a prisoner as well as he.
Us could not see her face, as her veil
etill remained down, yet there *.vas no
mistaking her form. Indeed he felt
that had it been midnight he -would
have recognized her presence. His
heart leaped within his breast at the
tight of her. He thought it beat so she
might almost have heard it in. the per
fect silence that had fallen, between
them. His first impui3e was to run to
ward her and take her in hi3 arms once
more. Above all his troubled conclu
sions of the night before the recollec
tion of that instant when he had held
her so closely still remained dominant.
In her presence he almost forgot every
thing but that. Yet he looked at her
impassively for a moment, bowed
slightly, then turned and walked de
liberately to the other end of the room,
resuming his station at the window
looking out to sea.
She had an excellent view of his back.
The beating of his heart did not mani
fest itself outwardly after all. To her
gaze he appeared as impassive, as quiet,
as motionless, as if he had been cut out
of iron like the jrrated bars. It was a
most unsatisfactory beginning to what
must prove an important interview.
They played at cross purposes indeed.
He had sacrificed himself to save her.
she had sacrificed herself to save him]
and here they were both prisoners ap
parently and things were as unsettled
as ever!
Poor. Fanny Glea was infinitely
more surprised^ at the sight of her
lover than he had been at the sight of
her. Not until she had fairly entered
the room and the door had been
closed behind her had she realized
that she was not aloneâ that he was
there. She stood rooted to the spot,
waiting to see what he would do. Had
he followed his first impulse, which
would have been to sweep her to his
breast, he would have found her un
resisting, submissive, acquiescent. The
kiss which had been given her last
night still trembled upon her lips, it
was for the taking, she was hi3 for
the asking.
CHAPTER IX.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
3Slowly she felt herself being drawn
nearer to Jiim. She struggled feebly,
glad ' to be overcome by his superior
strength. In another moment she was
in his arms for the second time. Her
head was bent down toward his
watch rocket. Holding her. safe with
one arm he put his hand under her
chin, and turned her face upward.
There were blushes on- her cheeks,
laughter and tears in her eyes. The
interrupted kiss trembled upon her
lips, and heâ well, this time it was
longer than the night before and more
satisfying. As he kissed her her arms
went around his neck again.
' "There was no other man." sh<*
whispered. "There never was any one
but you. I did wrong, very wrong,
but my father and you â that was my
excuse. And I loved you all the time."
When there was opportunity somo
moments later for articulate conver
sation he endeavored to solve the
mystery of her paternity, the under
standing of which he had put by in the
face of more pressing business â or
pleasure.
"Then your name isn't Fanny
Glen?"
"That's part of it"
"What's the rest of it?"
"Fanny Glen Vernon."
"What! Is Admiral Vernon your
father?"
"He is."
"How is that?"
"When the war broke out he stayed
with the North, was true to his flag, he
said. I had seen little of him since my
mother's death, when I was 10 years
old. I was a Southern woman. It
seemed monstrous to me. I begged and
implored him, but uselessly, and finally
our relations were broken off. So I
He had worked himself up into a
Jealous rage by this time. His self
control was completely gone.
"Who is the man?" he burst out at
last, while she took a. wicked joy In his
misapprehension.
"His â his â name â is â " she spoke
slowly and with seeming reluctance as
if to spare him.
"Then there is a man? Good God!
I had hoped, in Bpite of everything,
that I might have been mistaken, that
you acted so for some other reason.
Dc you love him?"
"Yes," faintly, turning away her
head.
"Do you really love him, or are you
making a fool of him as you did . of
me?"
"Eut I â love you, .too," she said de
murely, prently dropping: her head so
that her face was half hidden from his
intent gaze.
"How can you love both of us?" he
exclaimed, angered beyond endurance
by her apparent coquetry.
"It's â it's â different," she answered
demurely.
"If Lacy were here I suppose he
wculd understand, but women such as
you are beyond me.".
"It seems so."
"But why prolong this interview
longer. Miss Glen? Your secret is safe
Â¦with me. Probably you came here to
learn that. I will not allow you to be
tray it, either" â how inconsistent he
was. she thought â "you know that I
love you, and I know that you do not
love me, that your heart is with that
man on the ship. Won't you please
leave me alone? I really shall need all
my stlf-command, my strength, to face
thÂ«Â» court-martial, and youâyouâun
man me. I thank you for coming to
geant Slattery," answered the sergeant
oi the guard, a whilom friend of Semp
land. "On me own account, sor, I
come to tell ye that they'll be afther
comln' for ye In a few minutes, an'
ye'd biltter git ready fer 'em. If ye
have anythin'â any preparations to
make, ye'd better be quick about It,
scr."
"Thank ' you," answered Sempland.
"You hear, dearest? You must go. I
must have a moment to myself to en
able me to face this court-martial.
Leave me now, I beg of you. Go home.
After it is over I shall ask permission
of the general to have you visit me."
"I cannot go," said Fanny Glen
archly.
"Why not?"
"i am a prisoner."
"A prisoner! What for?"
"For treachery, disobedience* of or
ders, oh, everything!" she .'.answered
glibly. ' ??$s5p.
'What do you mean?" '
"General Beauregard sent me. here
this morning. The' court-martial is for
me, iiCt you. They're going to set you
free and I am to be tried .and shot, it
niay be."
"Nonsense! How did he find out?"
"I told him myself. I didn't disobey
you, you see. You had not forbidden me
to do it then."
"What did you tell him?"
"That Admiral Vernon was my fa
ther, and that I kept youâ Iâ Iâ loved
you."
"Great heaven! And- â "
"And then he called the adjutant
general and they whispered together a
moment and then he sent me here."
"Why did you do It?' cried the man
reproachfully. "They will punish you
in come way. I would rather have died

panied by a personal letter to my
friend. General Lee, in which I have
asked him to give you a position on his
staff with all its opportunities for use
ful service and distinction. May you
reflect credit, as I have no doubt you
will, upon the South, the State of South
Carolina, and all our hopes and ambi
tions for you. Gentlemen," to the oth
ers, "you are all witnesses to this re
habilitation of Captain Sempland?"
The room was instantly filled with
the sound of hearty cheering from the
officers In attendance.
"General Beauregard, you have
overwhelmed me," faltered Sempland
as soon as he could make himself
heard; "I have done nothing to de
serve this honor."
Beauregard stepped nearer to him.
"You would have sacrificed your life
for a woman," whispered, the gallant
little general approvingly, "I under
stand." Then he said aloud: "See that
you strive to merit our trust and confl
derce in the future, then. You will
have many chances for great deeds
with General Lee. Would that I were
with him."
"General," said the young man,
"your- kindness emboldens me. This
lady, sirâ"
"Is a prisoner," said the general
shortly.
"I know it, sir. She committed a ter
rlMe blunder, yetâ"
"Gentlemen," said Beauregard, turn-
Ing to his staff officers, "you know the
story of last night. How this lady In

was the destruction of the Federal
flagship by a torpedo, and Incidentally

"When I released you you clasped me
around the neck and returned my ca
ress. I'll swear you did, and all the
time you had another man In your
heart."
"Another man!" she exclaimed in
great astonishment.
"Yes. That man on the Wabash."
"Oh, the man on the Wabash!"
"Yes. You wanted to save him. So
you played with me. Why weren't you
honest about it? Why didn't you tell
me the truth? But no, you chose to
disgrace me for him. Well, you succeed
ed. I shall pay the penalty. I shall keep
silent for your sake. He may have you
and you may have him, but my death
will be ever between you. The burden
of obligation will be heavy upon you
both, more than you can carry!"
q_ CHAPTER X.
**I think they would believe me against
even you," answered Sempland. "I
would tell them that youâ ahâ love me
and that you were trying to save me.
And more, If you say one word to Gen
eral Beauregard or any one else about
it after you leave this room I give you
my word of honor I will declare that
I was afraid to go and that I stayed
with you."
"Why will you be so foolish?" she
asked.
"Because I love you," he burst out,
"that's the only reason. I have told
you before, but you did not seem to be
lieve Itâ at least you did not appear to
care; but now it won't hurt you to
hear It once more. You won't have to
hear it again from me. It's the last
time. I expect every moment they will
be here to summon me before the court
martial, so I must tell you now. You
are a cruel, heartless coquette. You
encouraged Lacy â "
"I did not!" indignantly.
"And you didn't dlscourare me."
"How dare you say so?"
"Last night when I held you in my
arms and kissed youâ"
"I was powerless."
"I am sure they would not believe
you against me," she retorted veha
mently.
"And I am willing to make any amends
that I can. I will tell General Beaure
gard myself that I did Itâ that it was
my fault. That I alone, am to blame."
"I forbid you to do it!" he exclaimed
with great energy.
"I do not care what you say, I shall
do it!" stubbornly.
"You do not know what it means."
he urged, his heart
leaping: at the
thought that she
was willing to set
him right and take
the blame upon
herself â and she
loved him after all!
Yet he * could not
permit her to do it.
"You do not know
what this would
mean to you." he
repeated. "It was
an act of high
.reason to the
South. They will
put you in my p'a?e.
They will certainly
punish you."
"Would they shoot
me?" she inquired
in her most fright
ened manner, her
eyes wide open with
beautifully simulat
ed terror.
He felt so sorry
for the poor little
frightened thing.
He longed to gather
her up In his arms
and comfort her, re
assure her.
"'TTsey might." he
returned. stepping;
nearer to her and
visibly unbending.
"I cannot have you
take the risk. I
won't allow it."
There was some
thing nice, after all,
in the imperative
muc-d, she thought.
"But how will you
prevent it, Mr.
Sempland?"
"I tell you, I for
bid you!"
"But if I disobey?
I never promised to
obey you, did I?â
that is, not yet?"
"I cannot compel
you, of course," he
answered sadly, drawing DacK a little.
"I know I have neither power nor in
fluence over you, Miss Glen, but this,
at least. I can do. I can swear that
you are not telling the truth."
"And that you will be found guiltyâ"
"I shall be."
"Andâ you mayâ beâ shot!"
"You should have thought of that last
night when you arrested mfe, impris
oned me and so made me false to my
duty. But what's the use â " He
checked the swift rush of his indigna
tion and continued in bitter calm: "A
woman who could so trifle with a sol
dier's honor cannot appreciate the con
sequences to him."
"I am sure." she went on very hum
bly, "that I didn't realize what- would
happen."
"Of course not." sarcastically.
"Give yourself no concern, Miss Glen,"
he said loftily; "I shall not betray
you."
"What! You won't tell him?" amar
edly.
"I will not," sternly.
"But they sayâ I heardâ you are to
be â court-martialed."
Her voice sank to a low whisper, as if
she were awestrlcken by the heavy tid
ings.
"I am."

ing humility.
"This room is not mine; I am a pris
oner, madam. I have no choice as to
my guests."
"But you will soon be free," returned
the girl quietly. "That is, as soon as
General Beauregard learns that I â I â "
see ne, butâ rorgive my apparent dis
courtesy â I would rather be alone.
Good-by."
"Wait," she said. "That man on the
Vnbashâ "
"By heaven!" he interrupted savagely
â he was a man of somewhat elemental
passions when he was aroused, and he
was â¢ thoroughly aroused then â "have
you no mefcy, no pity? This Is too
much! I don't want to hear a word
about him. Whoever he is I â "
"Stop, sir!" cried the girl Impres
sively, "or you will say something for
which you will be sorry."
"Sorry! I should like to have him
within reach of my hand!" he said
grimly, extending his arm as he spoke,
and his expression was not pleasant
to see. "I'd " \
"I am sure," she went on hurriedly,
cutting him off, "you would not do a
thing to him if he stood right here."
"Would I not? And pray, why
not?" he asked bitterly.
"Because â "
She stopped reluctant to dlscolse her
secret. Once she did so her power was
gone.
"Becauseâ" she said again.
"Tell me In heaven's name! You
torture me!"
"Because he â Is â my â "
Again she stopped and again his
anxiety got the better of him. He
caught her hands in his own and held
them with a grasp that hurt her.
"My God, will you cease this
cruelty? He is not your â you are not
really married to him, are you?"
"Hardly. Let go of my hands," she
answered, striving to draw away; yet
for a fairly strong young woman she
exhibited an astonishing feebleness in
her endeavor.
"Who is he?" with Imperious insist
ence.
"My fatherâ there! Now will you re
lease me?"
"Your father! And there Is no other
man?" in great bewilderment, through
which the glimmering of a greater re
lief began to shine.
She shook her head.
"And you did this for him alone?"
"No-o-o," with reluctance, "not al
together for him alone."
"Who else then?"
"I told you last night," she an
swered evasively.

Thcre was a hurried movement on the
part of the sentry in the corridor, fol
lowed by the trampling of many feet*
On the threshold stood General Beau
regard himself, his visage charged with'
an unusual degree of solemnity. Back
of him were grouped the members of
his staff and others who had been on
the wharf the night before. They were
all In full uniform and made a most
impressive sight. It was a highly dra
matic moment, full of menace to the
woman. As for Sempland, he scarcely
comprehended It.
"The court-martial!" whispered Fan
ny Glen fearfully, instinctively shrink
ing closer to Sempland as she spoke.
That officer knew, of course, that no
court-martial was ever Inaugurated in
that manner, but he said nothing. He
did not understand. He would await
developments. Something was in the
wind, certainly. What could It be?
"Captain Sempland," said the gener
al formally, advancing further into the
room, followed by the rest, "you are
relieved from arrest, sir, and "
"Captain Sempland?" murmured
Sempland in great surprise.'
"Yes, sir, .. Captain Sempland, with
marked emphasis on the title. "You
are restored to duty forthwith, sir,"
continued the general, stniling at his
astonished subordinate. "The charges
of neglect of duty and disobedience of
orders which I made last night and re
peated this morning are withdrawn.
There never was any suspicion of
cowardice or treason. Although you did
not succeed, having been prevented by
causes beyond your control, as I now
learn, from taking out the David, yet
your earnest desire to do so, the fact
that you volunteered for the detail,
and even besought me to give it to you,
the extreme measures to which you re
sorted to escape from confinement in
order to carry out your orders, even go
ing so far as to threaten a lady, war
rant me In promoting you. Here," re
ceiving the weapon from one of the
staff officers, "Is your sword. I return
it to you." Next the general drew some
papers from his coat. "Here is your
commission as captain. Here are or
ders which take you to the Army of
dropped die name of Vernon, and cama
here'ta work for our cause â the rest
you know. But I could not let him
be blown up unsuspecting, could I? If
he were killed in action It would be
terrible, but that was a dreadful end
ing. I thought â I don'.t know what I
thought. I love the South, but â ''
"I understand, my dearest," he said,
in no condition to understand anything
very clearly, and caring little for the
moment for anything except that she
loved him.
"And you forgive me?"
"Forgive you? With all my soul.
This moment, with you In my arms,
with your arms around my neck, with
your kisses upon my lips, with your
words in my ear, with you** love In my
heart â this makes up for everything!
I shall go to my death gladly."
"Your death?"
"Yes. Your confession to roe makes
no difference."
"But I will tell the general."
"I forbid It! Darling, you have com
mitted an' act of treason to the South,
and while your love for your fatherâ
, and for me â has explained it,' you could
not make such a plea as that before
any court-martial composed of soldiers.
You would only harm yourself and you
would not help me, and so I won't al
low it." /
"But I will tell the general!"
"Dearest, no," said Sempiand, smil
ing fondly at her. "We will anticipate
what might have been. If all had gone
well you would have promised to obey
me before the altar. Would you not?"
She nodded with astonishing docility.
"Well, thenâ"
"And if I will not?"
"Why, then, I shall have to discredit
you, as I threatened, and my own situ
ation will be more serious than before,
for I shall brand myself as a coward,
as well, and you would not like your
lover to have that stigma on him."
"You will not let me save you, then?"
"No," answered the man, sighing
deeply, "and life Is so different to me
now. I didn't care an hour ago what
happened, but nowâ"
There was a tap on the door. ' I

tiently.
"It's me, Lieutenant Semplandâ Ser-
than have you tell. What shall I do
now?"
land Such conduct is essentially
treasonable, especially In a state of
war. What is the punishment for such
actions In the face of the enemy?"
"Death, Blr," returned the assistant
general solemnly.
"Are you all agreed as to that, gen
tlemen?"
"We are, sir," was the unanimous re
piy.
They had been well tutorad in the
Httle^comedy which the general had ar
ranged, it was evident.
"Impossible, sir!" cried Sempland in
agony. They deceived even him with
their seriousness. "This is most ir
regular! I protestâ"
"I am ready, gentlemen," whispered
Fanny Glen bravely, turning very
white as she epoke and not appearing
at all ready In fact. "Iâ Iâ am glad to
â suffer since Captain Sempland â " she
faltered with a miserable attempt at
courage.
"One moment, please," broke In the
little general imperatively. "But, gen
tlemen, the culprit has otherwise de
served well of her country, as you
know. During the war her services in
the general hospital have been beyond
price. She Is a woman. On the ship
which It was proposed to blow up was
her father, Admiral Vernon, a South
Carolinian, whose ideals of duty led him
to continue his services to the United
States. These are mitigating circum
stances. Here Is no treachery to the
South, merely a woman's desire to save
her father from a swift and sudden
death. No mischance has arisen from
her action. Major Lacy took out the
boat with his usual distinction, al
though, fortunately for the lady, the
Housatonic seems to have suffered in
stead of the Wabash. Under these cir
cumstances, I think, it does not be
hoove us to be too severe. You agree"
with me, I am sure, gentlemen?"
"Certainly, sir, we do," replied the
officers In- chorus.
"Thank you! thank you!" exclaimed
Fanny Glen gratefully with boundless
relief In her voice.
By this time she was as close to
Sempland as she could get, and, entire
ly unconscious of what he was doing,
the latter had thrown his arm protect
ing around her waist. â¢
"Walt, Miss Glen." said the general
severely, lifting his hand and checking
her further speech, "you cannot think
to escape scot free. Such actions can
not go entirely unpunished. As long as
Miss Fanny Glen exists she must suf
fer for her actions. You are agreed
with me, gentlemen?" .
"We are, sir."
It was remarkably the unanimity
-with which they all supported their
general's decision, on bo serious a mat
ter and practically without delibera
tion.
"Captain Bempland. as a soldier, I
am sure you will acquiesce in the views
of your brother officers."
Sempland bit his lip. Fanny Glen
nestled closer to him and looked up at
him beseechingly.
"Oh, general," he said at last. "Isn't
there some way out of it?"
"There may be," said the general sol
emnly. "Let me think a moment. Sup
poseâah, suppose Miss Fanny Glen
should disappear?"
"But where can I go, sir?" asked the
girl nervously. "All that I love â " she
observed a smile flickering upon the
general's lips as she glanced at Sein;>
land, "I mean everybody and every
thing that I love Is here." She stamped
her foot Impatiently. "You won't serd
me to the Union fleet? I know my
father is safe â but I love the South. I
will never do anything wrong again if
you won't send me away!" she pleaded.
It was. Indeed, a sweeping promise,
one she could scarcely have kept.
"There are other ways by which Miss
Fanny Glen might disappear," said
Beauregard gravely.
"How, sir?"
."You might change your name â
again!" f
"Change my name?"
"Yes. You might becomeâ Mrs. Hhttt
Sempland, let us
say!"
"O-o-h!"cried the
girl, blushing furi
ously and drawing
away from her
lover's side.
"Quite bo," an
swered the general
with deep gravity,
too deeD not to be
suspicious, while
Sempland's heart
leaped with happi
ness. This was the
meaning of the
general's Httfe
play, then.
"P r o c e e dings
which would have
. to be Instituted
against Fanny Glen
could' then be al
lowed to drop,"
continued Beaure

situation immense

solution, gentle
men?" he asked,
throwing back his
head and laughing
cheerfully at the
ileasant ending of
:he little comedy
le had planned,
which pleased the
iroall audience
hugely.
"That is the hap
piest of all solu
tions, sir," said
Sempland, taking
Fanny G 1 e n'a
hands.
"I won't be mar
ried simply to save
my life," paid the
girl.
"Or course not,"
Â¦aid the general.
"Yet either you
must Be court-martialed, or Mr. Semp
land will be."
"Iâ Iâ might do Itâ to save â his life,
sir," she said, bluahlnjr furiously again.
"However It Is done," said Sempland.
"however It may be brought about, It
satisfies me completely."
" 'If 'twere done when 'tis done,
'twere well 'twere done quickly,* "
quoted the general with striking appo
slteness. greatly delighted at the out
come ojC the affair.
"I agree with you entirely, sir," re
turned Sempland, smilingâ It was the
part of wisdom for a captain to agree
with a general always, and the way of
prudence was the path of pleasure In
this Instance.
"Captain 8empland,'Â» â¢ said Beaure
gard. "your orders may not be carried
out until to-morrow. There will be time
enough before fhat time for a wedding,
in which, In the absence of her father,
I promise myself the pleasure of giving
away the bride. NdW, gentl&ien, we
will leave theâ ahâ two culprits to talk
it over for" a few moments. Let me
know your decision. Miss Glert, as soon
as may be, that I may decide whether
to- assemble or dissolve the court. And
rest assured the happenings of last
night and this morning, so far as they
concern Miss Glen, are not to be spoken
outside this room by az..* one. Good
morning."
Â¦ "Fanny Glen," said Sempland when
they were alone once more, "are you
marrying me to save yourself?"
She shook her head.
"Rhett Sempland, are you marrying
me," she asked In return, "to save
yourself?"
"I am marrying you, you little
darling, as you very well know, because
I love you." *
"And that Is my reason, too," said
Fanny Glen. MY
"Fanny Glen," he said Imperiously,
"come here!"
And to him she came with astonish
ing meekness.
"Put your arms around my neck."
And obediently she put them.
"Lift up your head."
Slowly, surely, up It came.
After all, Fanny Glen did love a mas
terful man.
THE END.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
4The present leader of the Irish Par
liamentary party Is John E. Redmond,
one of the very few really eloquent
speakers in the present House of Com
mons. After a stumping tour in Aus
tralia on behalf of the Irish Land
league he visited San Francisco, ac
companied by his brother William,
about twenty years ago. They were
well received and left a most favorable
Impression. He has been In Parliament
ever since and was one of Parnell's
most faithful adherents. When at the
behest of Gladstone the majority of the
Irish members dethroned Parnell from
the leadership in consequence of the
divorce scandal of Shea vs. Parnell,
John Redmond stuck to his chief. When
the party, after having been long di
vided, was reunited John Dillon with
drew In favor of Redmond and he has
shown himself admirably qualified for
the leadership. He is supported by
many able debaters and experienced
parliamentarians, but among them
none so brilliant and able as William
O'Brien, who has suffered great pri
vations and hardships in the cause of
Ireland. He cajne very near losing his
life at the hands of a mob of Orange
men in Kingston, Canada, for daring
to talk In that city about home rule
for Ireland.
The 1 determination of William
O'Brien to resign his seat in Parlia
ment and withdraw from public life
is received with great sorrow by his
colleagues of the Irish Parliamentary
party and his countrymen of nearly
every class and creed. John Red
mond declares his loss would be al
most irreparable and calls on the
.United Irish League and Irishmen
generally to do all that is possible to
. Induce Mr. O'Brien to reconsider his
decision. Of all the men prominent
in the Irish struggle against land
lordism and English misrule for the
last twenty years William O'Brien Is
the most popular. Parnell was a
great leader and master of men, but
he was not an orator. He was cold
and distant In manner . and hated to
speak from a public platform. Sent
to a school In England when a boy
and afterwards to the University of
Cambridge he had the coldness of
style and mannerisms of speech of an
Englishman. O'Brien, on the contrary,
was in his element on the public
platform. On the green hillside,
"where every sod beneath his feet was
an Irish patriot's sepulcher," he
played upon his audience as "Elhon
of the Hills" played upon the harp,
moving them to tears and laughter at
will. Fragile in frame and weak in
EealtlT hls'menfaf vigor" mastereM BW
bodily weakness, and he went through
scenes and strife like that described
by St. Paul as to what he endured in
his labors as Apostle of the Gentiles.
If O'Brien had been born in France at
the time of Lafayette he would prob
ably have been found at the top of a
barricade or leading a forlorn hope
against the Bastile. The whole ap
pearance of the man Indicates a
restless, enthusiastic character like
what we would expect to find in
Peter the Hermit at the time of the
Crusades. He began lifer in the hum
blest walk of Journalism and step by
step he advanced until he became edi
tor of United Ireland, a newspaper
founded by Parnell in opposition to
the Freeman's Journal, which was
considered too slow for the times. He
proved himself the very embodiment
of the militant journalist. Day after
day he poured hot shot into the camp
of the enemy. The Chief Secretary
for Ireland at the time, Mr. Forster
felt that either United Ireland
should be crushed or that he should
pull up his stakes and quit. The
paper was suppressed and William
O'Brien was put into prison as a "sus
pect" without trial before Judge or
Jury. . When William Forster threw
up the sponge and retired from the
administration of Irish affairs O'Brien
was released only to continue In still
fiercer and more defiant tone his at
tacks upon the coercion regime. It is
remarkable what a number of the
supporters of the Parnell policy be
longed to the Journalistic profession.
A. M. and T. D. Sullivan. Sexton.
Healy, O'Brien, Harrington, T. P.
O'Connor, Justin McCarthy and his
son, Justin Huntly McCarthy, made
imperishable names for themselves as
heroes In the strife. Most of them
have risen to fame and fortune. Space
will permit me only to refer to one of
this bright galaxy. Not since the days
of Burke and Sheridan did an Iri3h
orator command such attention in the
House of Commons as Thomas Sexton,
the present editor of the Dublin
Freeman's Journal. When the House
had barely a quorum present,
the whisper, "Sexton Is on his legs."
was sufficient to fill the empty benches
with members of every party. In con
sequence of his brilliant record he
had the exceptional honor of election
to Parliament from an Ulster constitu
ency within the very corral of the
enemy. Since his retirement the most
strenuous efforts have been made, in
vain, to induce him to return to the
scene of his triumphs in the House of
Commons. Gladstone, in a letter to
Lady Wellseley, described Sexton as a
"master" and acknowledged "in mat
ters of finance he was second to
none." As Lord Mayor of Dublin.
Sexton made a most enviable record.
At present he believes he can serve his
country best by sticking to his post in
the editorial chair of the Freeman's
Journal, where his services are called
into great requisition since the pits
sage of the Wyndham land bill. He
has passed through the darkness and
tne dangers of the jungle and the for
est into the open and now sees a
clear path and bright sunshine over
head.
WONDERS OF RADIUM

thosa which were radio-active. The
active substances were concentrated
by arduous processes, until at last a
few hundredths of a grain of enor
mously active radium were obtained.
The accepted theory of radium is
that It is an element that shoots off
particles of Itself into space at such
terriflo speed that 100,000 miles a sec
ond is considered a low estimate. Not
withstanding the fact that this waste
goes on continually and at such enor
mous velocity the actual loss is almost
nothing. One result~bf this marvelous
emission of particles is the maintenance;
of heat three degrees higher than the
air which surrounds.it. It has been
proved that radium not only possesses
this remarkable property, but that its
rate of heat emission remains un
changed regardless of the temperature
of the element which surrounds it.
In other words, there is no percep
tible variation when the air that sur
rounds it is of 90 degrees or that of
812 degrees Fahrenheit, when air be-,
comes liquid. So wonderful is this ele
ment given to the world by Mme. Curie
that the most brilliant scientific inves
tigators both here and abroad are put
ting forth the greatest systematized
efforts to discover new properties. Con
jectures that seem wildly Improbable
are daily made public, yet it cannot be
denied that radium has extraordinary
possibilities. It is so highly luminous
that print can be read by its light, and,
curiously enough, it possesses the pow
er of imparting Its own luminosity to
other bodies which In their normal
state are quite inactive. â¢ -.''*â¢'â¢*
So powerful is the photographic ac

fT^ HE study of temperaments con
1 siders all characteristics of - the
I body which show any mental pe-
Jt culiarity. For two thousand years
it has been recognized to be a subject
of great importance. For many years
it has been known that a study of tem
peraments was one of the best ways of
learning to know people as they really
are. Only lately w has the Importance
of a knowledge of temperaments been
considered as useful for the teacher.
Seldom, if ever, has been emphasized
the Importance of parents studying this
subject, that they may train more sat
isfactorily their own children.
Every person knows in a vague sort
of way that many whom they meet
have their characters stamped Indeli
bly upon their faces. So clearly do their
characteristics stand out that we feel
almost able to read their thoughts.
How few have ever considered the im
portance of determining, roughly at
least, the temperament which predom
inates in each child. Yet to a large ex
tent parents might thus determine not
only the best treatment for the train-
Ing of any child, but they could fre
quently determine for what profession
each one Is best suited. While few. If
any, have emphasized ' this fact, still
fewer will dare deny the truth of the
statement.
A very large proportion of ruined
children are the victims of training,
such, as the (parent would never have
subjected them to had they appreciated
the peculiarities of certain tempera
ments.
After having determined their own
temperaments parents should try to de
termine" what characteristics of any
temperament are most marked in each
child. Having certainly determined this,
a ~ few suggestions may be of untold
value to the 'present and future wel
fare of the child.

alyze and ultimately kill. As this dead*
ly effect can be produced with a minute
speck it can be easily understood that
radium in any quantity would be dis
astrous to human beings.
Professor Curie even asserts that he
would not venture Into a room contain
ing two or three pounds of the element
for fear that his eyesight would be de
stroyed, his skin burned and possibly
he would be fatally stricken. Radium
destroys the germinating power of
seeds, kills the larvae of butterflies and
had such a bactericidal effect that it
has been used to good purpose in the
treatment of skin diseases, and even in
cancer. Its power of causing other
bodies to : become luminous renders it
invaluable In the testing of precious
stones. By its aid diamonds are ren
dered phosphorescent and can thus ba
readily- distinguished from paste imi
tations, which are not so sensitive to
the rays. .
Recent writers on the subject have
gone so far as to say that a pound of
radium uncontrolled would annihilate
the earth, that in smaller portions it
would aid In the transmutation of
metals, that it may solve the probliim
of light without heat,- perfect wireless
communication and achieve possibilities
still beyond the horizon of our knowl
edge. Many hypotheses have been ad
vanced to .explain the wonderful mani
festations of radium. It is considered
certain that part of the emanations are
streams or torrents of material parti
cles infinitely ' smaller than the atom,
which until now has been considered
the smallest subdivision of matter, pro
jected Incessantly by the subject Itself
with a speed at least 100,000 miles a sec
ond. ' Beyond .this fact little Is known.
It is yet to be determined what prop
erty of matter permits any. form of it
to maintain a practically eternal-en
ergy ' in expelling a stream of frag
ments of its own mass so ' small that
they cause no appreciable loss in
weight, and what Is the form of the
matter thus projected. . -\

unscrupulous. In work and play, ear-

ic temperament is not apt to be im

â¢ The child of a' lymphatic tempera
ment \ needs a little more vigorous
treatment than the nervous child. While
parents should at all times be kind,
they may be more energetic and force
ful with a child of this temperament.
Such a child will not need so much di
rection as the nervous child. However,
he will stand, without great injury, far
more harshness. A child of this dispo
sition is often believed to be stubborn,
whereas in truth the child Is naturally
slow to comprehend and act.
The Bilious Temperament.
A child of nervous temperament is
apt to be impulsive and excitable,
quickly provoked and Jus^t as quickly
reconciled, persistent in work, very
apt to study harder in school than is
best, apt to be cheerful, likely to speak
quite rapidly, in many cases undecided
about action.
What terrible mistakes parents are
daily making In the treatment of the
child of nervous temperament! The
nervous child acts on the minute from
impulse. If such a child is angry or
stubborn, don't be too hasty. Give the
child a little time. Speak gently and
quietly. The result will be the child
will change for the better in a moment.
The government of such a child must
contain much of love, though it may be
full of quiet determination. Parents
should beware lest, by harsh treatment,
they rouse all the worst passions of the
child's soul. It is Just as easy to give
such a child the direction needed. In a
way which will enlist all its best sym
pathies. It la a nervous child who la

like the child with the nervous temper
ament. Is likely to be lmplnslve, ex
citable, quickly provoked and easily
reconciled. He Is apt to be quite cheer
ful and look on the bright side of
things. Less imaginative than the child
of nervous temperament but more emo
tional. A child of this temperament is
likely to be happy in the pursuit of any
object, little or great.
The sanguine child Is really quite
hard to manage at times. Tears flow
quite easily. Angry looks and improper
words are likely to be frequent. This
child must have a firm government.
There need be very little said if it Is
spoken In kindness, but what is said
must be said with firmness.
While it is very easy to fln<i children
who show most of the characteristics
of some one temperament. It Is very
difncult to find a child who shows all
the characteristics of any temperament.
Nearly all have what may be called
mixed temperaments, which fhvvr some
of the characteristics of two or more
temperaments. However, one of the
four mentioned will probably predomi
nate.
While some may prefer one tempera
ment and others another. It would seem
that, that individual Is most fortunate
who is blessed with a balanced temper
ament. In the balanced temperament
the four temperaments blend, so that
the objectionable tendencies in each are
tempered In such a way as to give tha
most satisfactory results.

Next to the nervous child the child
of bilious temperament is most apt to
be greatly injured by improper meth
ods of management. The child of a
sanguine or of the lymphatic tempera
ment will stand a great deal of im
proper treatment without being great
ly Injured. Not so with those of other
temperaments. How many children of
this temperament have been driven
from school or from home to the Jail or
the gallows because of improper treat
ment! The child of this temperament
will not soon forget Its Aiger. There
will remain the pouting and mean dis
position to get even. He Is almost as
hard to deal with as a balky horse.
Nothing but great kindness will enable
a parent to properly manage the child
of this temperament. Beware of too
much harshness here, especially with
the older child.
The Sanguine Temperament.
rp-t LL scientists in all ages have
f I begun their investigations on
( I recurring accidents with what la
J[ called a working hypothesisâ
that Is, in ordinary parlance, a good
guess. So it is with the latest scien
tific discovery, radium, which appears
to throw off continuously an amount
cf energy of a very high order with
out Iocs In weight or diminution in
force. It also appears to send out par
ticles cf matter in the light which it
yields. In that respect the radium light
flitters from sun or electrio light, and
unless a mechanical or chemical shield
can be placed between the particles of
matter and any object upon which
the light Is turned there would be dan
ger, where the object is a delicate one,
â¢f its serious hurt. If not destruction.
A great deal has been claimed for ra
dium. A great deal was and Is claimed
for the Roentgen ray and the Finson
ray, but we must not expect too much
at the moment from any one of these
discoveries. They are all three of the
highest value In the world of science,
but their introduction to the world as
remedial agents will be deferred until
we know more of them. Already the
X-ray and*lhe Finson ray have been
most usefully applied â but even with
them the application is for the present
limited.
Radium Is In a class by itself and Is
a wonder-worker. Of course the sensa
tional side of the discovery has been
done to death in the press. Romantio
writers with vivid Imagination have
four.d In radium what Ponce de Leon
found In Floridaâ the elixir of life. The
blind are to be healed, the deaf made
to hear and the lame to walk, by the
use cf radium. A number of quasi
miracles have already been offered to
the public, but scientific men have
placed these stories where they belong.
No man's sight has been restored, no
deaf mute has been made to speak or
hear, and the lame have refused to
walk.
Still the possibilities of this wonder
ful metal, this radium, must set us all
guessing, and in our guessing we may
rind that working hypothesis to which
J have previously referred.
* Now it is time to come down to the
story of radium itself, which I premise
by eaying that the world owes its grat
itude to Madame Curie, the prime dis
coverer of radium, for bringing into
t
The search of this remarkable wom
an resulted In the discovery of two
elements. One ehe named "polon
ium," after the land of her birth; the
other was christened "radium." Both
were found to be "radio-active" â a
word invented by Madame Curie. The
details of her investigations are in
teresting.
In the first place, she had to se
cure several tons of pitchblende res
idue. This enormous masshvas found
to contain nearly all the metals to a
greater or less degree. It was neces
sary to separate such different metals
as lead and calcium sulphate, silica,
iron, oxide, aluminum, copper, bis
muth, zinc, cobalt, antimony, niobium,
barium, nickel, tantalium, arsenic and
others. Finally, after much costly
chemical work, the Curies reduced
the pitchblende residue Into portions

Briefly, the facts of the remarkable
discovery are as follows: A French
chemist named Becquerel had acci
dentally placed a sensitive photo
graphic plate wrapped in light-proof
paper in a drawer with a piece of the
phosphorescent salt of the element
uranium. Several days lajer it oc
curred to him to develop the plate,
and to his amazement he found that,
in spite of the darkness of the drawer,
and in spite of the light-proof en
velope, the plate had been affected.
Subsequent Investigations proved that
the uranium rays resembled the so
called X rays in their power to pene
trate apparently opaque objects.
Becquerel confined his attentions to
uranium, not dreaming that almost
within his grasp was one of the most
Important discoveries of the age.
It was at this hour that Madame
Curie was led to the study of uranium
compounds and luminous substances.
A woman of brilliant scientific attain
ment, she brought a wall-developed
mind to the work. She began an ex
haustive research of tho residua of
pitchblende, a peculiar black ere

and Colorado, from which uranium Is
derived. Assisted by her husband,
also a scientist, Madame Curie thor
oughly examined a specimen of Bo

devoid of uranium, and found It much
more active than any uranium salt

What then, it may be asked, does

ers, "until she has her own Parlia

after her own interests," similar to
the legislatures in the various States
of the American union. The central
ized bureaucracy known as Dublin
Castle must go. There are too many
Englishmen and Scotchmen holding
lucrative positions under the present
system to suit the "men in the gap,"
who have sacrificed much in their
country's cause and expect now to
get some of the rewards. Pat will

"separatists" and "moderates" became
his supporters. Michael Davitt. the
great Irish patriot, who had Just been
released from Dartmoor prison, where
he had spent over seven years as a
Fenian convict, Joined the Parnell
forces, and his example was followed'
by thousands who had lost faith in
"constitutional" methods of fighting.
Professor Galbraith of Trinity College,
an old Home Ruler, said to Parnell,
"You are in rebellion." "Yes," was the
answer, "but in Justifiable rebellion.
Englishmen will not give me an op
portunity of concerning myself about
the affairs of my own country, and I
mean to concern myself about the af
fairs of their country."
From that day to this is has been
the policy of the Irish Parliamentary
party to stand aloof from alliance'
â¢with Â¦ either of the great English
parties â Liberal or Tory â as the case
may be, but always to act and vote
as an independent body. Like Jay
Gould, who, as he expressed it, was
sometimes for the Republicans and at
other times for thÂ» Democrats, but
always for the Erie Railroad, so the
Irish members sometimes acted with
the Liberals, at other times with To
ries, but always for Ireland. This pol
icy, steadfastly adhered to, has won
for the people of Ireland many vic
tories, especially in the passage of nu
merous land acts,- culminating in the
latest and greatest known as the
Wyndham land act.
With regard to political rights and
priviliges of every description the
Irish representatives have forced the
declaration from both the great Eng
lish parties that there shall be no dis
crimination in future as against Ire
land, thus reversing the old policy of
special legislation in favor of England
and Scotland.
He said repeatedly: "I care nothing
for this English Parliament and its
outcries. I care nothing for its exist
ence if that existence is to continue a
source of tyranny and destruction to
my country." Acting on this declara
tion of principles, he determined that
if the House of Commons would not at
tend to Irish business he would do all
in his power to prevent the majority
from transacting English business. As
he could not subdue or corral the Brit

to the annoyance and pain and ominous

without a fierce and protracted
struggle. It is the old story, told in
the histories of nearly every nation in
Europe; the common, or what Lincoln
called the "plain people," had to fight
for their rights against the intrenched
power of the privileged classes. Eng
land has been the rcene </f mob riots

struggle began ebout twenty-five years
ago.^hen Charles Stewart Parnell was
elected president of .tne Home Rule
Confederation of Great Britain, dis
placing Isaac Butt, M. P., who be

called "nominal Home Rulers."
-The policy of the "Nominal Home
Rulers," under the leadership first of
Daniel O'Connell and afterward of
Isaac Butt, was conciliation. The head

Dublin, and presented him with a large
bouquet of shamrocks as a propitiatory
gift. If Parnell had been in Dublin at
the time of the royal visit he would
have probably watched with scornful
eye the procession of toadies and flunk
ies and Jobchasers from some garret
window or turned his back upon the
humiliating spectacle.
Parnell's policy was the very oppo
site of the "nominals." Instead of con
ciliation it was opposition. Instead of
submission it was fight. He was not a
physical force man. He believed Ire
land hadn't a ghost of show against
the mighty forces of the British em

'j? (Jw /? Wr 1 ducted in a very loose manner. Men,

but when it comes to selecting a wife, which is usually
considered to be a more or less important and permanent
proceeding, they are content to go blindfolded" into the
open market and accept whatever the fates or Brad
street's may allot. Matrimony -must be taken seriously,
he declared, unless a man happens to live in South Da
kota or Rhode Island; then it may be sent home on ap
proval, subject to change on return of goods and bill.
Acting on this theory Ortiello formulated a plan to insure 'himself
â¢ gainst drawing a blank when it should come time to put his hand into
the matrimonial bag. The arrangement was beautifully simple; he would
cast bis eye around the horizon for z. promising twig which he should
forthwith proceed to bend in the genera! direction in which he desired
the grown tree to incline. After a careful search he discovered an incip
ient specimen of the opposite sex who scmed to him to hold out every in
dication of tractabiltty and due appprecintion of his merits. Having
found the twig he set about bending it in a truly scientific manner.. A
nursery was set up in the home of an elderly lady of quiet tastes and a
leaning in the direction of afternoon tea r.nd Angoras!
The environment seemed to Othejh.- to be just the thine for his
scheme. The elderly person had run against a disappointment in her
early youth that had permanently predisposed her against man and all
his works, and the representative of the sex who had since succeeded in
Kitting within half a mile of her without a search warrant has. never
been exhibited in public. By dint of a diligent use of the key that is sup
posedto unlock even the most tightly closed doors, even though- they
open into a postoffice or a large rotund Government contract, Othello in
duced her to walk up to his plans and fall into. them. , - .
For the sake of convenience we will call the twig Marianna, al
though it is against our principle to call names.. Marianna was not
aware of the good fortune that was i:Â» cold storage .for ; her and it would
probably have made little difference if she had known of jt, being. at- the
age when three square meals a day and pjoportionate rations of hats and
gowns were of more importance than any plans that Cupid might be
concocting for her. According to the agreement signed, sealed and de
livered with the elderly person aforesaid. Othello was to be the sole di
rector and general manager of the training of Marianna's youthful mind
for the proper appreciation and appropriation of the exalted sphere, to
which she was presently to be elevated." â¢
As time passed Othello put in nftjch of his leisure acquiring , gray
hairs and a larger waist measure while Mar^nna occupied herself study
ing the daily hints from Paris by" way of Moneymaker's bargain sales and
guessing at the age of the newest matinee idol. There were times when
Othello was inclined, to doubt the wisdom of his scheme, especially when
he sadly called the roll of his capillary, covering and noticed mournfully
how the list of the missing increased steadily. Sometimes he even ques
tioned his ability to fall in line with some of Marianna's cherished plans
for the distribution of his surplusMncome . among the summer hotel
keepers and retired pirates who officiate at the box offices aloncr Broad
way. He was coming within trailng distance of that stage in life when
a pair of comfortable slippers, an easy chair. and a warm fire are more to
be desired than a box scat at the horse show or a Delmonico handout.
Marianna, on the other hand,- was hovering around the age which consid
ers home as a place- for sleeping, eating breakfast and storing clothes in.
It may be inferred that the outlook for a patent safety match was not
of a sort calculated to take a' high rank in matrimonial history.
But the proof of the matrimonial pudding is in tying the string so
that it will neither slip nor bind, and Othello was determined to see the
thing through to the bitter end in the interests of science even if he hao-

actually had to wipe the tears from his eyes. , m
Well, to compress, this narrative a few sticks, when I told my friend
Mr. Vanmorganbiltâ that .was his nameâ that 1 had a hundred do lars in
cold cash and was. going to put up at a bang-up tavern, a fatherly ex
pression swept over his face that, almost made me feel as though I had
stumbled into a blood relation, and quicker than a "flash he insisted that
I spend a month at his Fifth-avenue home as a guest of himself, and wife.
. During the journey across the Hudson Mr. Vanmorganbile told me
that there were lots, and lots^of people in New York who would actually
steal things right out of a 'stranger's pocket and that I would have to be
awfully careful whom I associated with or I , would get. into a heap of
trouble. He made: it so strong. that. I decided to stick to him for safety
until I "got acquainted with- tht real nice families of the town.
When we landed* in New York it was dark, and Mr. Vanmorganbilt
suggested that, inasmuch as his wife was giving a reception to the ladies
of the 400 it would be a good idea forus to dine at a Broadway restau
rant arid take in a show .before going to his home.
V We had an awfully swell dinner and he footed the bill, so when we
reached thc theater. I insisted it was, my turn to treat. He didn't want
it that way a little bit, but finally I got him to consent to allow me to pay
our way in. Â¦ .: . . . . - . -
As I had never been introduced to the man who had the tickets for

of ; impertinent questions, so I gave him' a twenty-dollar bill to buy .the
tickets for me. Â¦â¢...â¢... \
; When we took o ( ur seats in the box Mr. Vanmorganbilt told me the
ticket seller had sent njv bill across to the drug store to have it changed
and that he would get the change for me between the acts.
In due time the curtain went up and I got my first peek at full
grown young ladies in short dresses. Gosh! but they certainly did look
fine when they danced and cavorted around the stage. I thought the lit
tle blonde in blue was just the darlingest creature I had ever seen, and
told Mr. Vanmorganbilt so. He said he would go out for my change
and ask the manager to introduce me to her after the performance. I was
perfectly willing. . â¢
He did go out, but He didn't come back. I felt for my roll; it had

of his alleged friends began to make remarks about the general tinde
fcirability of tying May â not to mention Mariannaâ up to January, which
Was Othello. It occurred to him in this connection that severe frosts
were to be expected in January and that his. budding hopes were in dan-
Kcr o f being nipped a little if he left them out over night.
Along with his plans for the education of Marianna Othello had been
silting up nights maturing his ideas for the preparation of the nest in
which his home-broken bird could be placed when he had taught her to
fly only in his direction. A corner lot had been bought at a reduced rate
in Farawayville, where the corrupting influences of the fashion plate and
the matinee idol should not come near his dwclling^and where he should
not be compelled to spend more than half his time* dodging around cor
ners to keep out of sight 'of the tax collector. A cottage had been
erected on the general lines of the Queen Annc-tiquntcd style and â¢ the
designs had been submitted for the oleander tub arid the ho.rse block just
abaft the^front gate. When Othello was not busy planning additions to
Marianna's educational structure he was sitting up nights figuring on the
best way of putting in the cellar stairs so that Marianna could run down
for a bunch of potatoes without falling into the cistern or being run off
on the sidetrack to the smokehouse. â¢Â¦â¢â¢Â¦ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ ~ -'Â¦â¢Â¦ Â¦ ' .
Meanwhile Marianna was. giving a very close irriitationof Bre'r Rab

might have. reached the conclusion that- there was .scinething in the air
which hadn't been' received at Othello's Marconi station. These conclu
sions were justified by la'ter' events that came upbnÂ«Othello like the inter

Rice Handicap, favorites barred,-when he. received a hurry-up. call from
the elderly person with the dyspeptic mind to * the. effect .that he was
wanted on an urgent-case. ' Marianna had eloped. with a young man of the
mature age of twenty-two who sported a red automobile and did his voice
up in curl papers every night. " It was an instance of what is commonly
known as the irony of Â¦< fate that the ungrateful' Marianna had laid a.
straight course to the very sameparson whom Othello had subsidized
several days, before. â¢ When the latter gentleman arrived on the scene
the knot was .tied hard and fast and the offenders were holding tight to
both ends of the string to keep it from slipping. There was nothing for
Othello to do but to hand over his blessing and retire as soon as possi
ble into the darkest recesses of the' dim past and take. a seat in the most
obscure corner. Later on he contracted a matrimonial alliance with the
elderly^person in order to avoid retaining too favorable an idea of the

THE Story of a Labor. Agitator"
âthat is the bald, unblushing
title of a book by Joseph R.
Buchanan, than whom no
champion of the rights of labor
was more before the public eye fifteen
years ago. Perchance Mr. Buchanan
hesitated over the title of his work.
"Confessions" would not have~ been
amiss in tha pLace of "story,'? for the
author is as ingenuous about laying
bare the stock In trade of a professional
agitator as he Is earnest, Jn setting^
forth the rightful province of; such an
individual in modern economic condi
tions. â¢/ .,
To state that Buchanan's book is
tftnely would be but giving expression
to the obvious. So much has been writ
ten in the "dismal science" of econom
ics, as Carlyle was pleased to call it,
about the theory of capital and labor
and so little there Is of all. that which
has real common sense application to
present day ccmdltions that to have the
momentous crux of the modern indus
trial question approached from ' the
other point of viewâ even the radical
pointâ is undoubtedly a valuable accre- '
tlon to the mass of opinion which has
been heaped up against the great rid
dle. The? work of this labor agitator
cannot be considered in any light as a
deliberate and dispassionate attempt to
harmonize the hostile . pretensions . of
employer and employe â the tone of ev
ery line indicates that such a mission
was far from the author's mind; what
Buchanan aims to do and what he has .
admirably succeeded, in doing Is to
present the business of a labor cham
pion, his alms and his methods. .
Whether deliberately or : unwittingly
the author of these confessions or this
autobiography, whichever you choose to
call it, has uncovered to the uninitiated
many of the primal weaknesses of such
as he which indubitably make for : the .
ultimate- failure of his^ efforts. Chief
among these Is the constant tendency
toward the radical in - action^qven i a

POEMS OF
DEPTH
AGITATOR'S
STORY
Buchanan's narrative !a not brought
down to present day incidents, for it is
to be surmised -that his sway as a la
bor leader was on the wane shortly
after the decline of the Knights of
Labor .movement. The story opens
with the author a typesetter upon ' a
country paper in Missouri and later a
member of the Typographical Union in
Denver. Hardly had the principles of
the -rights- of labor seeped into the
head of young .Buchanan when the
Lea^lville Miners' Un|on went 'on
strike; The novitiate In the labor
world leaped into .fame from the sum
mit of a packing box situated in the
middle of the main street, which served
as his nightly rostrum in the harangues
to which he gave voice. As a result of
his ardor Buchanan was lauded to the
skies by the labor element and threat
ened with lynching by the. Law and
Order League.
Somewhat lacking in modesty though
it may be, the recountal of the author's
famine years while editing a paper in
the interests of labor bears the stamp
of sincerity. Living in a single room
behind his press shop, "setting up" his
editorials direct .from the case without
precious time being spent in writing
them : first, starving for months at a
time, Buchanan certainly proved him
self a self-sacrificing servant of the
laborer. . Bitterly does the author com
plain upon the heartless lack of sup
port which his paper received from the
people in whose interests It was pub
lished. That this attitude drove the
harassed editor to pessimistic thoughts
occasionally Is evidenced by his reflec
tions upon those dark days.
' "More than once I loqjt hope," says
he, "that the wrongs of labor would
ever be righted by peaceable means.

fc / OWADAYS there is a very nar
|\| row line between what is pop-
I Â» ularly styled "freak" literature
* and legitimate expositions of
abstruse by-paths of thought. Works
upon psychic phenomena, . the rela
tion of r mind to "matter, of ;the body to
the spirit, etc., are looked upon with
a well-founded caution by well-bal
anced readers. They savor too much
of the medium's cabinet and spirit
whisperings to recommend themselves.
Either that, or they are too often
found to be without cause for exist
ence; merely ponderous arguments
which lead you back to the starting
point after dizzy ramifications.
Therefore it will be with a par
donable suspicion that the reader ap
proaches "Builders of the Beautiful,"
by H. L. Piner. This gentleman,
however, has not produced a book of
charlatanism or a reference reader
for spirit mediums, but has made a
worthy attempt to read into the flesh
ly form of human kind the workings
of the soul. He would have a beau
tiful body the abiding place of a beau
tiful soul. He would teach an ethical
physical culture.
According to the theory of Mr. Piner
man is the only creature of culture, and
evolution of mind is also evolution of
body. Since Plato's day it has been
recognized that a beautiful and cul
tured mind seeks always and only an
equally beautiful body, or In other
words a thoughtful, introspective mind
manifests Itself In a beautiful face and
form. The , builders and leaders of
every country have been among the
most beautiful and 5 cultured types,
just as the destroyers and criminals
have been among the ugliest and most
degrading specimens. These are mat
ters of common vknowledge and are in
complete accordance with the teach
ings of physiognomy;
Mr. Plner's . aim has been to stimu
late thought and self-examination and.
to illustrate by well chosen methods
the . connection between mental char
acteristics and emotions and the exter
nal bodily appearances. Incidentally,
he wishes to inculcate spiritual estheti
cism and better Ideals in life.
A person's character is always de
pleted in his face, which Is a simple
- book for those who can Interpret it.
Mr. Piner amplifies this in the follow
ing manner:
"Your body is the dramatization of
'your soul. It holds the tragedies and
the comedies of life. '
Â¦ "An evil spirit chooses ugly external
forms. A beautiful spirit seeks always
and only to illumine the organism It
' Inhabits.
"Form cannot be the form of noth
ing. Your visible appearance is but
an outward actualization of your in
ner life. ,
"The canon of correspondence of the
physical with the spiritual is a statute
â¢of being, unchanged and unchangeable,
and illustrated wherever mind weds it
self to matter.
"When the psychic forces are out of
harmony with the source* n? thÂ«.f r
' power and the laws of their existence
th'ey invariably deform' their physical
Â¦ supports.' When - they - are in . adjust
ment with Jthe ideal, the divine stands
"transfigured in the flesh and the mortal
is glorified of .the immortal."

Neith Boyce, whose first long novel,
"The Forerunner" (Fox, DufBeld & Co.),
has attracted much attention from the
critical, began writing in California
short stories of California life which
dealt with well-known materials of ro
mance â the priest and confessional, the
beautiful Spanish senorlta, the miner,
the cowboy, etc. "The Forerunner" is
an achievement in quite another vein,
showing neither the California of Bret
Harte nor of Mrs. Atherton. It has not
a single cowboy, miner, rancherÂ© or
senorlta In It. It Is more nearly the
country of Frank Norris, though deal
ing with a different ; section and with
city rather than country life. Beatrice
Harraden once wrote a novel of Cali
fornia with the '"romance" left outâ a
story of plain people who tried to grow
oranges and failed- "The Forerunner"
describes the land boom which tem
porarily wrecked Lob Angeles, and its
subject and treatment place it in Una
with "The Octopus" and "Hilda Straf
ford" rather than with the literature of
the "palmy" or blood-and-thunder
days.

1884. Denver^ was the- stormcenter
and Joseph R. Buchanan was evident
ly in the vortex of the whirlwind.
Vividly the author pictures the climax
of affairs which brought* to him daily
threats of lynching, how he had to
barricade himself in. his printing office

to render aid at an instant's warning.
Buchanan the agitator^ had become

number of the foremost naval officers
thought best, in self-defense, to meet
the approaching fleet and dispose of it.
Among the number was Mr. Roosevelt.
Mr. Roosevelt was eager to leave noth
ing undone that was necessary to in
sure our thorough preparation. I have
the highest respect for Mr. Roosevelt as
a man and a statesman. All his actions
during the time mentioned was in the
line of patriotism. In regard to the at
tack on the fleet. It was simply a dif
ference of opinion between Mr. Roose
velt and President McKinley."
That the Secretary of the Navy had a
high opinion of the ability of Roosevelt
during that official's connection with
the Navy Department is shown in the
following encomium: "Indeed, nothing
could be pleasanter than our relations.
He was heart and soul In his work. His
typewriters had no rest. He, too, lacks
the rare knack of brevity. He was es
pecially stimulating to the younger of
ficers who fathered about him and
made his office as busy as a hive. He
was especially helpful in the purchas
ing of ships and In every line where he
could push on the work of preparation
for war. Almost as soon, however, as
it was declared, hs resigned the Assist
ant Secretaryship of the Navy to ac
cept the lieutenant colonelcy of the
Rough Rider Regiment in the army.
Together with many of his friends, I
urged him strenuously to remain in the
navy, arguing that he would there make
a signal reputation, and that to go into
the army would be only to fight mos
quitoes on the Florida sands or fret in
camp at Chickamauga. How right he
was in his prognosis and. how wrong we
were in ours the result has shown. He
took the straight course to fame, to the
Governorship of New York and to the
Presidency ,of the United States."
Of the crowded events in the few
months' naval fighting with SpÂ»Un,
Long tells with accuracy and careful
attention to details. The battle of Ma
nila Bay draws from him sen exhaust
ive summary of ; the respective
strengths of Montojo"s and Dev/ey's
fleet,- their armament, the weights of
their broadsides, the complement of
their Â«Â«rews. To the American com
mander he gives unstinted praise; to
the valor, of the Spanish seamen he
pays respectful tribute, j Dewey's vic
tory Is not to be minimized, says Long,
on the score of the rottenness of the
Spanish defenses. That they had and
in fact used modern guns of power
sufficient to sink Dewey's fleet is borne
out by the subsequent investigations
of the conquerors.
It is to the blockade of Cuba, the bat
tle of Sanitago and the lamentable con
troversy between Schley and Sampson
arising out of the events of these two
movements that Long devotes a large
portion of his work. As is to be ex
pected, he supports the administration
in the trouble between the command
ers, but his rebuke to Schley has none
of the outrageous venom which char-^
acterizes the first edition of Maclay's,
history. He contents himself with
pointing out In detail Schley'a manifest
disobedience of orders in his dilatory
movement from Cienfuegos to San
tiago, and commenting upon it .thus:
"It was the lack not of personal cour
age, but of that unswerving steadiness
of purpose und nerve which is the es
sence of supreme command, and of
which Fafragut Is an example. Un
doubtedly it is a fair criticism on the
department that Schley was not re
lieved at once and an inquiry ordered."
Upon the subsequent appeal of Ad
miral Schley for a court of inquiry and
the unfortunate effect of the Schlcy-
Sampson controversy. Long writes
thus: "The unhappy controversy
which afterward grew out of the rival
claims of the friends of these respective
officers is the only incident of any mo
ment that mars the otherwise univer
sally applauded record of the. navy
during the Spanish War. Political and
partisan interests fanned the flame of
it. It raged more in the press and in
public discussion than In naval circles.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The Navy Department, its
head and some of its bureau officers
were without the slightest ground ac
cused of persecuting Admiral Schley.
In fact, the department had treated
him with a leniency that with an ear
lier knowledge of the retrograde move
ment in May (the dilatory advance on
Santiago) would have been inexcusa
ble." . . . ,
(The Outlook Publishing Company,

gives voice to many keen remarks on
feminine beauty and shows how it is
possible for a physically ugly face to
be beautified by mental culture alone.
If a person Is not more beautiful at
60 than at 16 it is certain the- interven
ing years have been lived both thought
lessly and negligently, for it is impos
sible to live, mix with the. world and
move amidst its many beautiful en
vironments without acquiring good,
healthy moral thoughts. Â¦ Thoughts.
sentiments, emotions, passions, says
Piner, by means of the muscles and
nerves, physically transmit them
selves to the face. It Is through this
that men are generally what they
seem and that "the body Is the .drama
tization of the soul." There Is no
evading the fact that persistent, beau
tiful thinking draws the features Into
harmony and then illuminates them
with beauty.
There is nothing Very startling about
the author's theories. There is no great
attempt at a scientific proof, for them.
The worth of the book lies more in
what it suggests to a thoughtful mind
than what it states. '' None J but a
thoughtful mind can find any pleasure
in its perusal. ' ' . .Â» '

When all the chords of nature thrill

When lifts the weary heart in prayer.
Ah, holler joy there cannot be
Than that which grief cannot impair â
When love looks through her tears at me!
When time's stern winter winds so chill
Sweep round us ere we are aware.
And scatter years like leaves, until
The tree of life is thin and bare â
Then would I fly from drear Despair.
And take my place, dear one. with the*.
For naught of joy can I forswear.

Then all Heaven's tents. O Prince, prepare.

And fain would I attend her there.

"His activity was characteristic. He
was zealous In the work of putting the
navy in condition for the apprehended
struggle. His ardor sometimes went
faster than the President or the de
partment aprroved. Just ( before the
war he. as well as some naral officers,
was anxious to send a squadron across
the ocean to sink the ships and tor
pedo-boat destroyers of the Spanish
fleet while we were yet at peace with
Spain."
After some of these comments had
appeared, Mr. Long was interviewed by
a representative of the New York Sun,
and said : "It was a very pressing time
In Washington^ those weeks Just before
war was declared. War was inevitable.
It was almost upon us. The Spanish
fleet, with its torpedo boats, was on its
tray to Cuba, and, although war had
not been formally declared, a large
In re\'icwing the nerve racking per
iod of tension Just preceding the dec
laration of hostilities against Spain,
Long makes some assertions about the
over- zealous ideas of President Roose
velt, then Assistant Secretary of the
Navy, which have been construed by
many newspapers as a sharp criticism
of the conduct of the then energetic
Secretary. Writing of Roosevelt's part
in the councils of the secretary's of
fice. Long says:
The author o;>ens his book with a
chapter uj>on the birth of the new sea
power. After briefly reviewing the ef
fects of the battle of the ironclads in
Hampton Roads in our Civil War, Long
proceeds to show to what a low ebb of
efficiency our navy had fallen in the fif
teen years succeeding that struggle.
When in 18T9 our fighting power on the
eea was represented by only forty
tight iron ships of the higher class,
mounting not a high-power rifled gun
among the number and inferior to
seme of the navies of South America,
American sea power was at its lowest
mark. Then, under the administration
of President Arthur, came the first
born of our new navy, the Chicago,
Boston, Atlanta and Dolphin. Long
faithfully describes the hesitation and
tight-fisted policy which marked the
actions of Congress in granting this
niggardly boon to the feeble navy. ..
In a detailed account of the organi
zation and several provinces of the
naval boards, bureaus and committees
which divide the stupendous task of
operating the naval branch of the ser
vice. Mr. Long defends the policy of
having civilians at the head of naval
offices, which is so unsparingly at
tacked by the English Lord Wolseley.
He cays:
â¢"Ours is a civil and not a military
government. The heads of the army
and navy departments are civilians.
The fundamental principle of our con
stitution is that the military is sub
ordinate to the civil function. Then,
too, as a matter of expediency as well
as of principle, it is better that the
head of each department should enter
upon his duties with an open mind and
without the possible bias of prejudice
or favoritism which might come from
having been himself a lifelong member
of the body over which he is placed."
Although admitting that friction be
tween the various bureaus often arises
on account of the overlapping of their
jurisdictions, the ex-Secretary would
have no general etaff for the navy such
as was provided for the army by the
last Congress. He maintains that such
a board would have a tendency to ar
rogate powers to themselves at the ex
pense of the Secretary of the Navy.
The present system of administration
is compact and yet clastic enough to
secure the most effective co-operation,
according to Long, and he would have
It that the Government let well enough
alone.
Long's book should be read by every
one who pays taxes for the support of
the Government, for it is a minute ex
position of the workings of that com
plicated beaureaucratic system of con
trol which diverts a portion of the Gov
ernment's money to the maintenance of
peace and national honor through the
navy. Vv to the time of the Spanish
imbroglio the navy of the United States
received little enough recognition, eith
er at the hands of the people at home
or the nations abroad. Now that these
great white squadrons have proven
their worth In battle and the only he
roes of our last war have been those
with the star of Annapolis on their
sleeves, it is full time for the American
people to acquaint themselves thor
oughly with the facts of the growth
and present usefulness of our new
navy.
THE New American Navy," by
ex-Secretary, of the Navy John
D. Long, is easily one of the
books of lasting importance of
the year. This comprehensive work, in
two volumes, which has Just appeared
from the press of the Outlook Publish
ing Company, has the value of being
the authoritative statement upon the
part played by our sea power in the
Spanish war, written by one who was
th* executive head and chief director
of that power during the momentous
period of preparation and the brief
struggle In Cuban waters. There have
been other works which have laid the
claim to being authoritative, but what
Edgar Stanten Maclay expressed with
such virulent assurance ex-Secretary
Lcng has put forth in the cold, judicial
attitude of one having command of ex
act Inside facts.

roses and chrysanthemums hung their
beautiful heads heavily beneath them,
but there was to be no more rain. Ore
gon City's mighty barometerâ the Falls
of the Willamette â was declaring to
her people by her softened roar that
the morrow was to be fair.
Mrs. Orville Palmer was in the large
kitchen making preparations for ihe
Christmas dinner. She was a picture
of dainty loveliness In a lavender gins
ham dress^ made with a full skirt and a
shirred waist and big sleeves. A white
apron was tied neatly around her
waist. Her husband came in end
paused to put his arm around her and
kiss her. She was stirring something
on the stove, holding her dress aside
with one hand.
"It's goin' to be a fine Christmas,
Emarine," he said, and sighed uncon
sciously. There was a wistful and
careworn look on his face.
"Beautiful!" said Emarine, vivacious
ly. "Goln' downtown, Orville?"
"Yes. Want anything?"
"Why, the cranberries ain't come y?t.
I'm so uneasy about 'em. They'd ought
to 'a' ben stewed long agro. 1 like 'em
cooked down an* strained to a Jell. I
don't see what ails them groe'rymen.
Sh'u'd .think they c'u'd get around
some time before doomsday. Then i
wantâ here, you'd best set it down."
She took a pencil and a slip of paper
from a shelf over the table and Rave
them to him.
"Now, let me see." She commenced
stirring again with two little wrinkles
between "her brows. "A ha'f a pound
o' citron, a hr.'f a pound o' candied peel,
two pounds o' cur'nts. two pounds o'
raisins â get 'em stunned, Orville; a
pound o' suet â make 'em give you some
that ain't all strings; a box o' Norther'
Spy apples, a ha'f a dozen lemons,
four bits' worth o' walnuts or a'mends
â whichever' s freshest; a pint o' Puget
Sound oysters fer the dressin', an' a
bunch o' celery. You stop by an' see
about the turkej-. Orville; an' I wish
you'd run In 's you go by mother's an'
tell her to come up as soon as she can.
She'd ought to be he.re now."
Her husband smiled as he finished the
list. "You're a wonderful housekeeper.
Emarine," he said. Then his face grew
grave. "Got a present for your mother
yet, Emarine?"
"Oh, yes, long ago. I got her a black
shawl down t' Charman's. She's b'en
vantin' one."
He shuffled his feet about a little.
"Unhbunh. You â that is â I reckon you
ain't picked out any present fer â fer my
mother, have you, Emarine?"
"Xo," she replied with cold distinct
ness. "I ain't." There was a silence.
Emarine stirred briskly. The lines grew,
deeper between her brows. Two red
spots came into her cheeks. "I hope
the rain ain't spoilt the chrysanthe
mums," she said then, with an air of
ridding herself of a disagreeable sub
ject.
Orville made no answer. He moved his
feet again uneasily. Presently he said:
"I expect my mother needs a black
shawl, too. Seemed to me hern looked
kind o' rusty at church Sunday. Xotice
it. Emarine?"
"No," paid Emarine.
"Seemed to me she was gittin' to look
orful old. Emarine" â his voice broke;
he came a step nearer â "it'll be the first
Christmas dinner I ever eat without my
mother."
She drew back and looked at him. He
knew the look that flashed into her
eyes, and shrank from it. \
"You don't have to eat this'n without
her, Orville Partner! You go an' eat
your dinner along with your mother f f
you want! I can get along alone. Are
you goin' to order them things? If you
ain't, Just eay bo, an* I'll go an' do 't
myself!"
He put on his hat and went without a
word.
Mrs. Palmer took the saucepan from
the stove and set It on the hearth. Then
she sat down and leaned her cheek In
the palm of her hand, and looked stead
ily out the window. Her eyes held a
far-sighted look. She saw a picture,
but it was not the picture of the blue
reaches of sky and the green valley
cleftby its silver-blue river. "Shesaw a

"How does he look? I don't see 's

"What does all him?" cried out Em

at?"
"WelJ, if you don't know what ails

He's dyin* by inches ever since .you
turned his mother out o' doors."
Emarine turned rale. Sheet light
ning played in her eyes.
"Oh, you'd ought to talk about my
turnln' her out!" she burst out, fu
riously. "After you a-settin* here
a-quarTn with her in this very kitchen,
an' eggrin' me on! Wa'n't she goin' to
turn you out of your own daughter's
home? Wa'n't that what I turned her

how! I only told Orville this" house
''vra'nt big enough' fer his mother an '
me, an' that neither o' us 'u'd knuckle
down, so he'd best â¢ take his choice.
You'd ought to talk!"
"Well, if I egged you on, I'm sorry
for 't," said Mrs. Endey, solemnly.
"Ever sence that fit o' sickness I had
a month ago, I've felt kind o' old an'
no-account myself, as if I'd like to let
all holts go an" Jest rest. I don't spunk
up like I ust to. Xo, he didn't go to
Peterson's â he's gawn right on. My
land! I wonder 'f it ain't old Gran'ma
Eliot; she had a bad spellâ no, he
didn't turn that corner. I can't think,
Â¦where he's goin' to!"
She sat down with a sigh of de
feat.
A smile glimmed palely across
Emarine's face and was gone. "May
be if you'd go up in the attic you
could see better," she suggested, dryly.
"Oh, Emarine, here comes old Gran'
ma Eliot herself! Run an' open the
door fer her. She's limpin' worse 'n
usual."
Emarine flew to the door. Grand
ma Eliot was one of the few peo
ple she loved. She was large and
motherly. She wore a black dress
and shawl and a funny bonnet with
a frill of white lace around her brow.
Emarine's face softened when she
kissed her. "I'm so clad to see you,"
she said, and her voice was tender.
Even Mrs. Endey's face underwent
a change. Usually it wore a look of
doubt, if not of positive suspicion, but
now it fairly beamed. She shook
hands cordially with the guest and led
her to a comfortable chair.
"I know your rheumatiz is worse,"
she said cheerfully, "because you're
limpin* so. Oh, did you see the under
taker go up by here? We can't think
where he's ; goin' to. D' you happen
to know?"
"Xo, I don't, an' I don't want to,
neither," Mrs. Eliot laughed comfort
ably. "Mis' Endey, you don't ketch
me foolin* with undertakers till I have
to." She sat down and removed her
black cotton gloves. "I'm gettln' to
that age when I don't care much
where undertakers go to so long's they
let me alone. Fixin' fer Christmas
dinner, Emarine, dear?"
"Yes, ma'am," said Emarine in her
very gentlest tone. Her mother had
never said "dear" to her, and the
sound of it on this old lady's lips was
sweet. "Won't you come an' take
dinner with us?" ; .
The old lady laughed merrily. "Oh,
dearie me, dearie me! You don't guess
my son's folks could spare me now, do
you? I spend ev'ry Christmas there.
They most carry me on two chips. My
son's wife, SIdonie, she nearly- runs
her feet off waitin* on me. She can't
do enough for me. My! Mrs. Endey,
you don't know what a comfort a
daughter-in-law is when you get old
an' feeble!"
Emarine's face turned red. She
went to the table and stood with her
back to the older women; but. her
mother's sharp eyes observed that her
ears grew scarlet.
"An* I never will.** said Mrs. Endey,
grimly.
"You've got a son-in-law, though,
who's worth a whole townful of most
sons-in-law. He was such a good son,
too. Jest worshiped his mother;
couldn't bear her out o' his sight. He
humored her high and low. That's jest
the way Sidonie does with me. I'm

him and hi* few smiles were joylesa
things.
For the trouble he blamed only him
self. He had promised Emarine solemn
ly before he married her that If there
were any "knuckling down" to be dons,
his mother should be the one to do It.
He had made the promise deliberately
and he could no more have broken' it
than he could have changed the color of
his eyes. When bitter feeling arises be
tween two relatives by marriage Jt la
the ono who stands between then*â the
one who is bound by the tendereat ties
to bothâ who has the real suffering to
bear, who is torn and tortured until life
holds nothing worth the having. Or
vllle Palmer was the one who stood be
tween. He had built his own cross and
he took it up and bore It without m
word.
Emarine hurried through the early
winter dark until she came to the small
and poor house where her husband's
mother lived. It was off the main-trav
eled street.
There was a dim light In the kitchen:
the curtain had not been drawn. Em
arine paused and looked in. The aash
was lifted six inches, for the night was
warm, and the sound, of voices came to
her at once. Mrs. Palmer had company.
"It's Miss Presly," s- *1 Emarine, re
sentfully, under her breath. "Old gos
sip!"
" goln* to have a fine dinner, 1
hear," Miss Presly was saying. "Tur
key with oyster dressin*. an* cranber
ries, an' mince an' punkin pie, an' reel
plum puddln* with brandy poured over
It an' set afire, an* wine dip, an* nuts
an' raisins, an' wine Itself to wind up
on. Emarlne's a fine cook. She knows
how to get up a dinner thc.t makes your
mouth water to think about. You goln*
to have a spread, Mis' Parmer?"
"Not much of a one," said Orvllle*s
mother. "I expected to, but I c'udn't
git them fall potatoes sold off. I'll have
to keep 'em till spring to git any kind o'
price. I don't care much about Christ
mas, though" â her chin was trembling,
but she lifted it high". "It's silly for
anybody but children to build so much
on Christmas."
Emarine opened the door and walked
In. Mrs. Palmer arose slowly, grasping
the back of her chair.
"Orville's dead!" she said, solemnly.
. Emarine laughed, but there was the
tenderness of near tears In her voice.
"Oh, my, no," she said, sitting down.
"I run over to ask you to come to
Christmas dinner. I was too busy all
day to come sooner. I'm goin* to
have a great dinner, an' I've cooked
ev'ry single thing of It myself! I want
to show you what a fine Christmas
dinner your daughter-in-law can get
up. Dinner's at 2, an' I want you to
come at 11. Will you?"
Mrs. Palmer had sat down weakly.
Trembling was not the word to de
scribe the feeling that had taken pos
session of her. She was shivering. She
wanted to fall down on her knees and
put her arms around her son's wife
and sob out all her loneliness and
heartache. But life is a stage, and
Miss Presly was an audience not to be
Ignored. So Mrs. Palmer said:
"Well, I'll be reel glad to come,
Emarine. It's offul kind o* you to
think of *t. It 'u'd 'a* be'n lonesome
eatin* here all -by myself, I expect."
Emarine stood up. Her heart was
like a- thistledown. Her eyes were
shining.
"All right," she said; "an* I want
that you sh'u'd come Just at 11. * I
must run right back now. Good
night."
"Well. I declare!" said Miss Pres
ly. "That girl gits prettier ev'ry day
o* her life. Why, she Just looked full
o'glame. Jo-night!"
â¢ â¢
Orville was not at home when his
mother arrived In her rusty best dress
and shawl. Mrs. Endey saw her com
inug. She gasped out:
"Why, good grieve! Here's Mis'
Parmer, Emarine!"
"Yes, I know," said Emarine calm
ly. "I ast her to dinner."
Â¦She opened the door and shook
hands with her mother-in-law, giving
her mother a look of defiance that al
most upset that lafy'a gravity. .
"You set right down, Mother Partner,
an' let me take your things. Orville
don't know you're comin*, and I , Just
v*ant to see his face when he comes in.
Here's a new black shawl for your
Christmas. I got mother one Just like it.
See what a nice long fringe It's got. Oh,
my! Don't go to cry in'! Here comes Or
vllle."
' She stepped aside quickly. When her
husband entered his eyes fell instantly
on his mother, weeping childishly over
the new ehawl. She was In the old
splint rocking-chair with the high
back..;K :
"Mother!" he cried. Then he gave a
frightened, tortured glance, at his wife.
Emarine smiled at him... but it was
through tears. ... /â¢<' - ;
"Emarine ast me, Orville â she ast me
to dlnner'o' herself! An* she give me
this shawl. I'm cryin'â forâ Joy."
' "Last her to dinner," said Emarine,
"but she ain't ever goin' back again.
She's goln"< to. stay. I expect we'w both
had enough of a lesson to do us.**
, Orvllle did not speak. He fell on his
knees and laid his head, liks a boy. In

But there was something In her eyes,
too, that made thesa beautiful.
A POINT OF KNUCKLIN' DOWN
8"The girl of 1004 will be different in
a way from any other girl. Her face
will show the American characteristics
which are those of a sweet blending of
other nations. All races meet here
and produce a type as different from
the French" type as one color is dif
ferent from another. To a practiced
eye it is impossible to make a mistake.
"The girl of 1304 will be distinguish
able as to her dress. And In this con
nection it can be said that portrait
painting is greatly affecting the dress
ing of women.
"When a sitter comes to me I say to
her, *I cannot paint you until I see
your gowns.'
"She displays them or describes
them. None will do. All will be outre
in a short time. This gown has an ex
aggerated waist; this one is too tight in
the skirt: this dress is trimmed with
something in the very height of an ex
treme style, and upon. this., gown
fleams a novel decoration which will be
absolutely funny in five years' time.
" 'You must buy a gown,' I say to
her; 'none of these will do at all.*
"Then I tell her what to buy. Some
times I tell her how much to pay for
it. She goes away and purchases the
gown. And in so doing she teaches
herself a lesson. This is the lesson of
true greatness In- dress, the purchas
ing, of. a gown which will hold its own,
no matter how the styles may change.
~ "A woman cannot look lovely In a
gown that Is extreme."
And the boy who was born In Frank
lin. Indiana, fifty-two years ago- and
who came to town, like "William
Shakespeare, with nothing except a.
clever brain, one suit of clothes, and an
individuality, pointed toward a rich
painting in which the drapery set off
the woman to the most exquisite per
fection. \ i .
"The girl of 1304 will, perhaps, be
able to dress better all the time, be
cause she is studying and learning.
"But It will take four artists to paint
her. I could paint the American girl
of 1904. But the Italian girl of 1904
must be painted by an Italian artist.
The French girl must be painted by
a French artist. The German gir! by
a German artist.
"She will not be satisfactory to her
own people if one artist paint all. There
Is a certain poise to a French woman
which It takes a French artist to catch;
and a certain fresh originality to an
American girl which none but an
Amerlcanfprlistj-L-an fully master."
"Perhaps," said Ur. Chase, rising
arid looking, in his eanie3tnes3, pre
cisely like the Sargent portrait, "per.
haps she will have a certain individ
uality, or touch, which has been be
queathed to her by the recent art
schools. And this will be conspicuous.
"Ilr3. dark, whom I painted some
years ago, and whose portrait I ex^
hibited. was one of the first and most
typical of American models. Her face
was distinctively American. She was
Gibson's first model. And was. thus,
the original of the ideal Gibson girl.
She was tall, serious, high bred, slen
der.
"Her face was American. No doubt
of It. And it was a type.
"You can tell an American face at
once. It is different from any other
face. Though, for the life of you, you
can't tell why it is so.
"Do you know your mother's hand
writing? Can you pick out the hand
writing of your dearest friends, at a
glance? Arid without being told? Cer
tainly you can. But how? You do
not know.. Neither doe3 anybody else.
You cannot say, 'It is the up stroke,
nor the down stroke!" It is so be
cause it Is so!
. "Thus with the American girL She
Is American because she is so.
"That will be the tendency In ->or
trait painting In 1S04. It has been th3
tendency for a .long time. Here tha.n
that, it has teen the rule.
"You weary of one face.' You weary
of one Etyle. You weary of one pose.'
You weary of one gown.- , -
"The great beauty of the girl of
1904 will be her variety. She ;will
possess intelligence, of course.- And
she will possess beauty, for .all wom
en of the better classes are beautiful.
She will, have refinement, that â¢ goes
without saying. And she will be in
dividual. ,'â¢Â¦'
"There is a great deal said about
the This-Girl or the That-Girl. There
is the Gibson "girl. And there is the
Christy girl. There is the Gilbert girl.
And there is the Henry Hutt girl. Arid
they are good!.
â¢ â¢ "But these are ideals. They are
types. Meritorious, beautiful, artistic'
and lovable.. They are yet types. The
artist himself does them in facetious
mood.. He does not regard. them as
decisive. He does not pretend to say
that all women are, or will â¢ be, mold
ed on these lines.
"Each beautiful woman of. 1904 - will
be different '< from each other woman.
{fC"pf HE #rl of 1904? What will
* I she be like? What a ques
tion?"
JL William M. Chase stood in
A he middle of a square room from
which girls looked down on pvery side.
There was not a window in Ibe room,
yet it- was lighted. There was not a
man in the room, fxeept Mr. Chase,
yet it was filled with masculine indi-
There was not a girl In the rtom, yet
it was peopled with pretty girls, some
eerious. some smiling, pome American,
some Spanish, some English. Yet all
girls-. In the background Mere a few
portraits of men. But why can ses
the men when there afe girls around.
Not Mr. Chase â nor anybody else who
has an opportunity to view the Chase
girls. "Come into the roomâ if you
don't mind a cigarette," said he.
"The girl of said the
American painter, looking up at a pret
ty type of girl In an automobile coat
walking along a gray street. "Why, of
course, ehe will be different from any
other girl, from every other girl that
ever lived. . 'Â¦.- 'â¢'â¢
"And for that matter every woman is
different from every other woman and
the> charm of womankind is that it is
so!
"Suppose you were to paint a picture
and say 'This is the woman who is to
come.* How tired you would grow of
that picture. And how earnestly you
would wish that It tnight be changed.
She' will^show character In" her fatco*
individuality in her pose and asharpi
decision in her manner.., To an artist
a mannerism becomes. a peculiarity. at
once. And if he understands the art
of portrait painting he at once endows
this. sitter with this mannerism.
"If I were to paint the girl of 1904,
and if she were to walk into my stu
dio and ask for a sitting, I would look
at her closely | arid study her quietly.
If she had a habit of turning her: head
as she talked you may be sure I would
paint her' in that pose. If she sat with

THE GIRL OF 1904
AS DESCRIBED BY
AMERICA'S GREATEST
PORTRAIT PAINTERworn with an embroidered sash; and
around the neck there were a great
many little sof : embroidered ruffles. It
escaped the ground, and; though ' not
fitted as to the skirt, it swept away in
a very graceful line. She wore with it
a string of pearls, the most elegant
Jewels of the day.
' Almost the same costume was seen
the '.tither day in the fitting room of a
very fashionable dressmaking ' estab
lishment. Â¦.''.The woman who' was having
it made for a New Year reception in
sisted that the waist be cut upon the
short' waist model, with full blouslng
front, while the skirt was finished with
a deep ruffle o: flounce. , A wide folded
velvet Birdie finished the waist, upon
which was placed a pearl buckle. Long
strings '. of pearls were to drape the
neck, which was finished- round with
many soft â¢ ruffles. "The whole, while
charmingly up-to-date, presented a cu
rious blending of the colonial and the
1903 and 1904. . .
Though there is nothing* aggressively
new this year, yet it is a season of nov
elties. And among the new things
there can be noticed the following spe
cialties: /
Large 'button molds covered with
cream silk upon which there is a design
in Japanese embroidery.
Beautiful girdles of silk, pointed up
at the back and finished with two long
tabs in front, which cross and are dec
orated with colored silks and are; run
through a gold ring buckle. " Â° Â¦
â¢And' lovely: new shades In silk, the
most, popular. of which are. spring
let, pomegranate red, stone, French and
silver gray, fuchsia red, crimson pink.
The silk petticoats come these days
made in such a fine manner that they
can be employed as linings, and if they
exactly match the dress they can be
worn under an unllned skirt with the
best effect, as a drop skirt.
"With a blue cloth gown of modest
and unllned there can be
worn a .blue silk drop skirt or petti
' coat. It should be cut very tight on
"the hipsâ as all good petticoats areâ
' and it should be made with a great
. many bouffant ruffles around the foot.
It Is a good plan. If it be a dressy skirt,
to add i a ruffle or two of chiffon Just

came, late in the afternoon, a sodxi ,
affair of no small prominence.
"Women who have not a great many
gowns should be careful to plan those
which they have In such a manner
that they are not conspicuous. Black
and white are the best colors, though
brown can be so disguised that one
does not grow weary of it.
Decidedly the materials of the win
ter are well adapted for round about
wear. Camel's hair and zlbeline,
though the two most popular stuffs,
are highly fashionable and very dur
able. And in this respect Dame Fash-
Ion has been most kind, for she has
graciously deigned to approve of ma
terials that wear well. ' And, so, she
has saved many dollars for the woman
who wants to be in style. /;!;:;-
The silks and the satins, the moire
and changeable velvets of all kinds
have their wearing qualities. But
they do not in any way compare to the
shaggy cloths in smartness, and, espe
cially for street wear, are the rou^h
materials best. The beaver cloth, Vith
its. satiny surface, and its guarantee of
long life, is about the best thine that
can be discovered these days for Tery
nice luncheon and afternoon -wear.

So great is the fancy for flowers and
flower decorations that pressed and
dried f.owers are impressed into the
service, and one gown of Paris impor
tation actually had large pink rose
leaves laid under tiny bits of glass,
with the whole caught in place by. a
tiny stitchery around the edge. But
such elaborate work is hardly neces
sary to beauty. And another gown,
also flower embroidered,- was trimmed
with a ruffle of lace, which was draped
here and there with real sprays of nat
ural flowers, which exactly matched the
embroidered flowers of the gown.
Every little trimming scheme is sug
gestive to tbe woman of taste and
fancy and a glance at any pretty model
will tell her something which can be
done with her own gown.
It Is a fact that a great many of
the most admired creations are the
work not of the French modiste, but
of the woman at home; and It is un
doubtedly true that, some of the most
exquisite gowns of the New York ball
rooms were brought forth, not from
the Custom-house, but from the clever
needle of the home student of fashion.'

The embroidering c-f gowns with flow

in little bunches at each side of the .

A gown of taffeta, either glazed or

The gowns of the present season are
so wonderfully picturesque that one

There is a woman in society who has
chosen the pansy colors for her own.
She invariably wears them and, since"
all the pansy shades blend charmingly,
she is always exquisitely dressed. Her
favorite tone is a lovely purple, but
she sometimes chooses the deep gold
of the outdoor pansies: and then her
gowns come out in their full gorgeous
ness.
Her gown for New Tear's day is a
pansy yellow crepe de chine, with the
skirt made with plain panel front. The
hips and tucked and the skirt is ex
tremely full, one of those new enor
mously full skirts which hang in many
folds around the figure, loose yet ding
ing, voluminous yet in no way bouf

Tbe trimming of this gown consists
of a fo'.ded girdle of pansy purple vel
vet which is laid around the waist in
a very deep crush of velvet. The stock
is a silk band with purple pansies em
broidered upon a cream ground. Ex
tending around the skirt are double
rows of embroidered Bilk pensies.
The waist, by the wayâ and here is
one very remarkable feature of the
gownâ is a cape shaped affair, 'short
on the shoulders, very deep In the front
and waist deep in the back. It fas

hang's loose and Is worn over an un

In preparing her gown for a New
Tear's reception, or, in fact, for any
r.ice occasion, one must remember that
it is not a gown to be looked at crit
ically, but to be worn in the gaslight,
and perhaps only a few times.
An example of a pretty frock, made
for only a few wearings, was noticed
the other day. The foundation of the
dress was a pomegranate red silk pet
ticoat with an underwaist to match, Â».
Over the skirt was worn three skirts
of tarlatan.one in pale green, 'one' in

Odd lengths of lace are treated with

speak his conversation flowed smooth

is one forte which makes him con
spicuous in the councils of the com

speaking quickly and with no re

lips is carefully weighed.
"Senator, what pleasure do you find
Iifthe toil involved in the manipula
tion of your vast properties?" I asked,
after being seated. -*;..'.^4^
The. question was put point blank.
Senator Clark droped his chin upon
his breast. He thought for a whole
minute and then he spoke:
"Toil ? Yes; that is the word. By'
toilyou mean the suspension ot'hours
devoted to pursuit of - pleasure. A
general efter a battle may take a few
hours to himself. The fires of his
camp, reflecting against the darkened
sky, are slumbering. He may muse

travels he always carries with him
his own stock of wines, and these
travels include trips into the wilder
ness and across deserts when he visits
some .of his mining properties,
which are now to be found in Mon
tana, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, New
Mexico, Oregon, Maine and Mexico.
After dinner another cigar, just one.
More business, to be sure, unless it is
the night of the opera, and then the
Senator will allow no work to Inter
fere with his enjoyment. Indeed,
every Sunday afternoon when he is in
New York^ there are musicales at his
daughters' homes, where the best art
ists In New York appear,. both after
noon and evening. In this manner
he entertains his friends during the
Sabbath day. Some .nights he will
work well Into the morning hours, but
as a rule he insists upon getting eight
hours' "sleep a day. This he deems
necessary In the , life , of every, man
whose brain is continually active in
the commercial world.
For society he . cares littler , He is.
always well dressed \ and his clothes
are made by the best tailors in Lon
don and New York. His whole idea
in life is economy. He buys only the
things that are necessary and then the
best. In Washington he is invariably
dressed in a frock coat, and wears a
silk hat. but in New York 'he^ Is often
seen in a plain business suit of unob
trusive pattern. Â¦

story of, his undertakings and the
Ideals he has learned to cherish^ He
received " me' graciously. It took him

Two o'clock comes and time for
lunch. Senator Clark spends a trifle
more time at his lunch than does Rus
sell Sage, but not much more money.
Not that he denies himself, but the
Senator is not a fastidious eater. He.
will probably take one little nip of
rye before this meal and smoke a
cigar after it is finished. Then back
to the office. It has not taken him an
hour. There are' people with whom
he must confer, more letters to an
swer and cipher telegrams and cables
to send to all parts of the world. At
this time of the year the shades of
night are being drawn when he set
tles back in his stiff chair and bids
his employes good night. At six
o'clock he leaves the office and is usu
ally at his daughter's apartment by
seven o'clock-
Dinner is not served until eight

Boucher. Constable, Millet, Corot,
Daubigny, Ziem. Cazln. Delacroix,
L'Hermltte, Rousseau, Abb*;- and
many others. His tapestries have cost
him fabulous' sums.
He selected these himself, for he
never depends on an art connoisseur.
These tapestries are among the most
beautiful ever executed by the^Gobelin
manufactory, after designs by
Boucher, Andran and others. Mr.

"There Is a sentiment, Senator, that
-when a man has accumulated suffi
cient wealth he should retire,". I re
marked.
Senator Clark's face grew tensely
earnest. From under his shaggy
brows his eyes gleamed and his thin
lips were tightly set.
"How can one retire and suspend
operations that mean so much to those
whose future he controls? It would
be criminal. Perhaps some have

1 cf Montana is a many sided
kj man. a rower-house of numerous
activities, a mixture of fascinat

parland of roses, if one would be poetic,
and. again, as firm as a rock on the
hills that have yicided him his vast
Â¦wealth.
So quiet, so reserved, so dignified
that he might have been taken for a
member of the judiciary, as he sat at
fcis desk in his office at 49 Wall
rtreet. one day last week and looked
his visitor full in the face, searching:
him with a lighting glance. A swift
question: then, as a regiment relaxes
at a command, the tenseness left the
features of the great organizer and I
was "welcome.
Man of millions, political power,
controller of the destinies of thou
sands of persons who depended upon
him for a livelihood: the largest indi
vidual owner of copper holdings In
the world, member of the United
States Senate, art connoisseur and di
rector in dozens "of institutions and
corporations, the ;r..in who is said to
have the largest income Af any person
in the world â how shall he be de
scribed ?
As one who has risen from the low
ly walks of Jife to a power in the
financial and political world, he
surely must bear characteristics and
possess qualities with which few are
endowed. Always erect, he is about
6 feet S H: inches In height. His
shoulders are spare, his frame is lean,
his features are sharply cast. He lias
the eyes of the eagle. They search an
interrogator with a penetrating glance
and speak when his lips are dumb.
His chin Is covered with a luxuriant
brown beard and his upper lip with a
carefully trained mustache. His hiir
is still abundant, and now. In the
Fixty-fifth year of his busy life, shows
only a. streak here and there. His
eyebrows are bushy and far protrud
ing, the eyebrows of a thinker, of a
man who closes his eyes upon a prob
lem one instant to open them the next

Senator Clark has the face of a
man of determination, of quick, de
cisive power, but still one that is
shrewd enough not to miss the minor
details f>t underta kings which often
mean so much for their success or
failure. lie impresses you with the
belief that he will fight, and fight on
with the tenacity of a bulldog, and
falling In the last ditch will rise and
light again.
His words are chosen, carefully
chosen; his voice is well modulated,
rarely risinjj above the tone used in
ordinary conversation. It was his
quiet demeanor, his soberness, his
seriousness, which can, if necessary,
give way to forceful and dramatic de
nunciation, that impressed me. While
his frame is not large, it is well mus
cled. Senator Clark being wiry, nim
ble, agileâ a combination of physical
acquirements which are the result of
years of continuous activity at his
mining properties in Montana and
other States, where one must be alert
and quick and active when climbing
among the rocks and debris upon a
tour of inspection.
Climbing mountains did Senator
Clark a world of good in making him
a strong man, as the healthful moun
tain air developed his lungs and made
his heart full and strong.
What about this man â his hopes,
his ambitions, his yearnings In the
autumn of his life, when the apex of
his career has been reached and there
is nothing to do but look forward for
another xvorld to conquer?
The private life of Senator Clark Is
laid bare for the first time.
If you were worth a great many

and what would you do?
Well, Senator Clark has got several
hundred million dollars, and this is
how he passes his time:
His habits are simple, his require
ments few. He has his fads, as you
have yours. He is very unlike the Hi

the year, but when he is there he
takes his breakfast shortly before
eight o'clock â that Is, after he has
etretched his muscular limbs in a

Breakfast is not sumptuous. His

light and simple, and he waits until
the day's duties are performed, whsn
he leisurely partakes of a rather gen

TO GLADDEN THE EPICURE'S HEARTTHE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL,
THE QUEER NEW YEAR OF GLOBE TROTTERS
they had spent at home. .But when
they tasted it the resemblance ceased.
It was fishy and tough. The meat
was like knotted rope yarn and the
gravy suggested tar. However. It was
a New Year dinner all the same, and
It was enjoyed as keenly as the finest
feast ashore that day.
An American traveler, who Is well
known commercially In the West In
dies, was mixed up In one of the
perennial revolutions of Hayti in his
hot and foolish youth. Unhappily, ha
allied himself with the weaker side.
and on New Year's eve found himself
one of a small band of desperadoes de
fending the stockaded town of Mlra
goane against a government army,
which outnumbered them by more
than 100 to 1.
During the night the Government
soldiers forcÂ«d their way Into the town.
Only about thirty of the defenders
were left alive.
"Stand them up in a line and shoot
them." commanded General Manlgat,
the Government leader.
But they were too weak to stand. All
of them were wounded, half-starved
and fever-stricken. So the Govern
ment troops propped them up In chairs
and shot them as they hilled there.
Only the white man was spared. In or
der that his case might be Inquired
Into. â¢; ;
When he protested to General Mani
gat against the cruelty of shooting
helpless captives that triumphant war
rior merely blew a cloud of ciearette
smoke and remarked calmly: "C'est la
guerre."
"Late on New Year's eve," said the
American, "they tried me by court
martial. When I woke up on New
Year's morning I was In the calaboose,
sentenced to be shot at sundown. It
wasn't very pleasant waiting. I was
quite glad when a gold-laced officer en
tered the cell toward evening, with a
paper Informing me that 'his excel
.ency. the citizen President.' had been
pleased to pardon me. In consideration
of the request of the American Minis
ter and of the fact that It was New
Year's day.
"I believe they had never Intended to
shoot me, but only to frighten me, for
they hardly dared to touch a white
man whose country owned a navy that
might bombard their ports. Anyhow,
I got out of Jail In time to eat my
dinner with some American and Eng
lish friends on a coffee plantation near
Mlragoane."
An American globe trotter tells how
he once spent a New Year's day hunt
ing a crocodile In Jamaica, West Indies.
After a long hunt the crocodile was
found burled beneath the mud In a
shallow bend of a river on the planta
tion. The hunters only carried small
shotguns, which were useless against
the beast's tough hide, covered as it
was several inches deep in mud.
But the planter was a man of re
source. He sent hurriedly for negroes
and set them to work to construct two
strong walls of bamboo poles across the
bed of the stream, thus inclosing the
crocodile in a prison from which he
could find no escape.
After the walls were built everybody
hid quietly in the tall grass on the
banks and waited. Hour after hour
they Jald there. Their luncheon con
sisted of sandwiches and a flask of
rum punch.
' It was not until the end of the after
noon that the crocodile, finding It could*
not break through the bamboo barriers,
crept out of the water. Before it could
drag the whole of Its huge carcass out
of the mud it was lassoed and hauled
toward the bank by twenty willing
hands.
Too surprised to offer resistance, the
beast at first suffered Itself to be al
most dragged on to the bank; but it
caught on the edge with Its forepaws
and made a desperate strugglu. Twen
ty yelling negroes hung on to the other
end of the rope, but could not drag that
crocodile up; they could only prevent
it from flopping back Into the water
again. Honors were easy In that ter
rific tug-of-war.
At last a yoke of eight oxen had to
be brought. They soon dragged the
beast to the bank, where it was tied
around a tree and dispatched with axes.
gested an old tar pointing to several
albatrosses which were circling about
the wake of the ship. "We'll stretch
a point this day and be forgiven for
it, I guess."
After several attempts an albatross
v. as captured with a big fishhook bait
ed with salt pork and dragged aboard
triumphantly. Served up nice and
brown and swimming in gravy, it
looked so much like a real turkey that
it warmed up the men's hearts and
made them think of the holidays
The skipper was superintending the
work from the poop rail and heard the
conversation.
"Cook!" he bawled out. "Lay aft
here!"
The cook ca,me out of his galley and
the captain asked what he could give
them for a fancy dinner.
"Nothin' but split peas, sir, an* salt
horse an' marmalade. There ain't no
turkeys in my store-room, sir," he said,
sarcastically.
"Let's catch one o' them birds," sug-
apprentice piped out:
"I say, fellers, this is New Years day.
Have you all forgotten it7"
They had. In the fury of tlys tem
pest, the thought of New Years or even
Christmas, usually so religiously ob
served on British ships, had slipped
their reckoning.
"LSelay your tongue," retorted the
gruff old mate. "There won't be any
New Yeir dinner to-day, except your
usual whack of lobscouse." '.
tearing gale, which orought her mizzen
topmast down on deck and ripped out
all her sails. For days she drifted
helplessly, exposed to the full fury of
the western gale.
The crew labored industriously at
rigging up spare and bending new
sails. It was a task of tremendous
difficulty, for giant combers rolled
over the forecastle head continually,
fillling the vessel amidships with green
seas. ;J.j\>:
Suddenly in the midst of this toil an
O-f GRIZZLED, sun-tanned, bard
f I featured man, whose face bore
I I . the stamp of hardship and ad
v J[ venture, was sitting In the
smoking room of a New York
hotel. He happened to glance at a
calendar and saw that the day was De
cember 31. {
"By Jove!" he exclaimed. "So to
morrow Is New Years day. Unless
something happens before then, it will
be the quietest New Year I've spent In
twenty-three year*.
"In all that time I have never been
so near my old home In Scotland as I
am now. Often I've tried to get home,
but somehow or other New Year has
always found me in a tight corner in
some out-of-the-way part of the
world."
This man's experience is typical of
that of many of the globe-trotters in
this age. when people are so fond of
"going to and fro in the earth and
walking ui> and down in it," like a cer
tain personage in the Book of Job. The
queerest and most adventurous New
Years nowadays are spent by globe
trotters, who almost always have exÂ«
citing stories to tell about what hapÂ«
pened to them when the festive season
caught them In Chinese Tartary or
In the wilds of New Guinea.
New Years day, 1897, found one Eng
lishman facing death from hunger and
thirst on board a life raft 300 miles
southeast of Madagascar. ' " !'
His ship had foundered seven days
before In a hurricane. The boats wen
smashed by the fury of the waves and
some of the crew washed overboard.
The rest made a raft out of planks and
spars, but during the night high seas
swept over the frail structure and car
ried away most of the water and food.
"All we had left," said the man, who
went through this terrible experience,
"were a few tins of potted meat, a
email barrel of biscuit and the small
est of the water casks. That was all
we had to keep life in twenty-five hun
gry men.
"We made it last as long as we could,
but in four days everything was gone.
Some of the men fell into despair and
talked about throwing themselves over
board. Perhaps they would have done
bo. but during the night of the fourth
day half a dozen big sharks swam
around the raft In circles. The sea
was phosphorescent and we could see
them plainly in the waves of livid fire
â¢which they stirred up as they swam
around. Even the half rrazed men who
had talked about drowning themselves
Fhrank from death in a shark's maw
and stayed upon the raft.
"Next morning; I saw by a pocket
diary which I carried that the day was
December 30. To keep up the men's
spirits, I told them I had dreamed we
were going to be rescued on New Years
day. That appealed to the superstition
inherent more or less in all sailors, so
I kept an telling them a ship would
come along and pick us up on that day

he wishes. If he could he would re
enact the laws of King Solomon on the
subject of matrimony. Those laws, as
you may remember, provided that every
man might have as many wives as he
chose. The President says he thinks,
in a country like Venezuela, a man
ought to be allowed, at the least, to
have a wife in every town which he 13

His Excellency the Citizen President
danced and made speeches until 5
o'clock In the morning. He had been
doing the same thing steadily for a
week, and he kept It up until the New
Year. ,
The American was anxious to cable
th* news of 'these gay doings to Amer
ica, hut the discreet censor at Caracas
would not pass his messages on the
subject. He tried to send them In
French. In German, in English. In
Italian. In Portuguese. All these fall
ing, in despair he tried American
slang, hoping to catch the censor nap
ping. He endeavored to tell his news
paper, among other things, that Castro
was "the Joklest highroller that ever
came down the pike."
In vain.' The censor wrote him a
polite note:
"I regret that code messages cannot
be allowed to pass during the present
political crisis. Will you kindly eluci
date, for me the meaning of 'jokiest
highroller' as applied to his Excellency
the Citizen President?"
And that Is why the story of Castro's
happy New "Sear at La Victoria Is now
told in detail for the first time.

is not unlike the proverbial bull in a
china shop. More than one poor girl
that night paid with a torn frock for
the honor of dancing with the presi
dent. And Borne of the men against
whose partners he bumped in the
whirl of the waltz looked as If they
would have liked to express their feel-
Ings had he not been at once their
host and the man who could order
them to be hanged before breakfast
if he chbse.
For a couple of hours the ball pro
ceeded in a stately, dignified way* as
most Venezuelan functions do. But
as the drinks circulated and the host's
magnetic enthusiasm .warmed up the
guests, the fun became fast and furi
ous.
After midnight Castro developed a
new line of activity. Every quarter
of an hour or so he insisted on stop
ping the music and making. a speech.
Of course he was applauded to the
echo bv the dancers. , In Venezuela
it is healthy to appreciate Castro's
oratory.
But there was one speech which evi
dently hit the merry crowd hard. The
cheers were so hearty and so spon
taneous that the American asked what
it was about. He didn't understand
Spanish.
"Is it," he inquired eagerly, "an im
portant political pronouncement? Has
his Excellency declared his poiicy
toward the powers? Pray translate
his words for me."
"Well, sir," replied an European
merchant who traded In La Victoria,
"it Isn't exactly what you would call
a . political pronouncement, but it is
a weighty deliverance on a great social
question."
"Indeed," said- the correspondent,
more anxious than ever.*- "And what
Is it?" . â¢
"The President says that he regrets
priest and general alike, and stopping
n'ow and then to chaff the prettiest of
the girls in a town where nearly every
woman is pretty.
. But this grew tiresome after awhile.
Hearing the band play was not excit
ing enough for a man of his tempeia
merit.
"Stop!" he suddenly shouted to the
bandmaster, and lifted his cane.
"Enouph of this! We will, go -to the
palace and dance. Everybody, is in- .
vited. There Is room for all, and I hope
everybody will come." )
In Venezuela Cipriano Castro's wish
is equivalent to a command,, and the
consequences of disobedience' are not
usually pleasant. So everybody^trooped
after him to the palace, from the In
dian peon In his osnaburg smock and
canvas sandals to the Governor of the
province in his gold-laced uniform.
Castro made no distinctions. All of
his guests had the freedom of the pal
ace for the night and he did his level
best to see that everybody had a good
time. He handed around the drinks,
found the girls partners, chatted amia
bly with the dowager*, talked politics
with the; old men, showed the band
master how to put more spirit Into the
music, and, Incidentally, found time to
dance more than anybody else. He
was as ready to waltz with the pretty
peasant girls as with the blue-blooded
senoritas of Castilian ancestry, but it
was noticeable that he only chose short
women for his partners. He is very
short himself and rather touchy on the
subject. He does not care to be in
the company of a tall woman. .
Many oz the women did not seem
particularly glad when Â¦ he asked them
for the pleasure of the next, number.

strolled up to see what was doing.
* It was'simply a gang of boys play
ing one of the favorite juvenile game
of Venezuela. A. triumphal arch ha<
been erected across the street and s
big basket was swinging from it abou
ten feet above the ground. This baske
was filled with cakes, candies, fruit
nuts, small nickel ' coins arid othe:
things dear to the boyish heart all tin

out the contents with sticks. "Whei

an exciting scramble, compared witl

The music stopped. Castro saw the

he walked over, with his pretty part

all about. He was told that Europe

Immediately he struck a Napoleonic

the air and exclaimed:
"Not while life remains! General

an apology from Europe."
The girl hanging on his arm clapped
him on the back and shouted, "Bravis

He Bid been in prison about a year
Â¦when he employed me to try to obtain
a pardon for him. The one-half inter
est in the mine he had conveyed had
become very valuable and the circum
stances of the conveyance were such
as to give color to the suggestion that
the deed had been made under dur^?3
and could be set aside. I agreed to give
my services toward obtaining: a pardon
in exchange for a quitclaim deed to his
equitable interest in the mine. He be-^
ing civilly dead the deed was required
to be made by his heirâ his father, liv
ing In Nebraska. All this was accom
plished by correspondence. The com
pany to whom the mine had been con
veyed being made aware of what was
going on sent an agent to Nebraska and
offered the father first $3000 and then
$5000 for a quitclaim deed. But the old
man replied that he had already signed
a deed to me and would not sign an
other, unless his son requested/him to
do so. Then the manager of the mining
company went to Yuma, interviewed
the tonvict and offered him $5000 and
a free pardon for a letter to his father
requesting the old gentleman to sign
a quitclaim deed to the company. The
convict refused to do this, saying that
he had already caused a deed to be
made to me ar.d that it would not be
the square thing to sign another. To
this posltfon he \ adhered, although
threatened with all the infieunce of the
company to defeat my efforts to secure
a pardon.
On being informed of hi3 action I set
tled the case, making it thÂ«Â» first condi
tion of the settlement that the influence
of the company should 1 i exercise^ In
aid of a pardon. By our joint efforts
we obtained the pardon and the man
who would not go back on his word,
though threatened with life imprison
ment for keeping it, wa3 once more a
free man.
Thus equipped for business the even
ing train from San Diego carried the
gold bullion buyer to the appointed
place of meeting. The dusky miners
and their agent met him a hundred feet
from the depot. It was too dark for
close examination and the bar wrapped
In a grain sack was hurriedly trans
ferred and the money package received
only a hasty scrutiny. Both parties
were in too much of a hurry â for rea
sons â to linger long in each others com
pany. The two Indians and their com
panion averred that they were in haste
to reach their camp near Oceanside and
would so by the same train that had
brought the victim to Delmar, and the
victim v/as anxious to return to San
Diego by the south-bound train, which
would be due in a few minutes at Del
mar. So . thev parted with words of
goodwill on the part of the Caucasian
and grunts from the red men, supposed
to express aboriginal approval.
Will it be believed that this mining
superintendent, who was a man of
means, experience and ordinary shrewd
judgment, was about to tumble neck
over heels into the trap? He procured
510,000 from the bank, but at the last
moment had the wit to obtain a lot of
green paper cut to the dimensions of
greenbacks ar.d made them up into
bank packages, labeled 51000. with a $20
bill on the top and bottom of each
package. These he wrapped in one
package and placed in the center of the
package a note addressed to the Indian
chief, statins that this course was
taken from caution and not for the pur
pose of defrauding the gold bar owners,
and if one cf them would come or send
in to his office in San Diego the next
day he would â if the bar was all right â

sors, but I have never yet known one
who had not some redeeming *.raits,
and I have never known one who was
a coward. It was in the early eighties
that I went from Tombstone to Bisbee,
Arizona, to look over some mining
ground, concerning which litigation was
expected. Our party consisted of the
owner of the mine, his expert, my wife
and myself. We were in a light two
seated" vehicle," the mining Expert 'as
driver. On our return the next day we
found several vehicles near the bank
of. the arroyo, waiting for the flood
occasioned by a cloudburstâ to pass
by. Two horsemen drew rein near our
vehicle *artd ' ofÂ»e" of them 'dismounted'.
My wife was anxious to get a view of
the flood from a point about 200 yards
away. It was not possible to drive the
carriage there, so after the free and
easy fashion common to the wild and
woolly West, she addressed the dis
mounted man and said, /'Won't you
lend me your horse for a few minutes
so that I can ride down to the river
bank and take a look at the flood?"
After hesitating an instant he replied,
"Certainly, madam": assisted her to a
seat in the saddle, from the pommel of
which hung a Winchester, rifle and a
belt of cartridges. "The horses are not
accustomed to being separated," said
he, "and my companion; will ride with
you." The other horseman escorted my
wife to a point of view several hundred
yards away, and the dismounted man
approached the buggy. in" which I was
seated and holding out his hand ex
claimed, "How do you do." I returned
his salutation and looking hirri* square
ly in the face I said, "Really, you have
the advantage of me, but I do not re
member that we have ever met before."
"Why, don't you know me?" said he.
"Indeed, I do not." I replied. "Don't
you remembering appearing in court
and trying a case for me at Prescott?"
"It may be." said I, "but somehow my
memory falls me." Nothing more was
salfl, and my wife having returned the
two men rode off southward toward the
Mexican line, 1 which was a few miles
away. An hour or two afterward we
reached Charleston, where we were to
stop for the nisht. "It is strange you
did not know that man,"- said cne of
my companions; "he seemed to know
you so well." "Oh. I knew him well
enough," was my reply, "and he knew
that I knew him, the fearless devil.
That was the outlaw. Curly Bill."
"Why," said ray companion, "there is
$5000 reward offered by the Territorfr
and the Southern Pacific Company and
Wells-Fargo Company for. the capture of
that man. And we could have taken him
Just as well as not, for his horse and
arms and comrade were gone." "Yes,"
I answered. ..."and my wife was with
them. Besides I am no thief taker and
owe no duty to either Wells-Fargo
Company or the Southern Pacific Com
pany."
One of the most honorable men I eve^
knew was a convict for life in the
Yurr.a, Arizona, penitentiary. He was
a prospector, and while inebriated so
that he was both mentally and morally
irresponsible, had shot and killed a
stranger. Regaining consciousness and
being made aware of what he had done,
he attemcted to flee to Mexico. Seek
ing shelter, en Toute. at a frontier post,
one of the officers, who knew him, of
fered him $500 for his half-interest in
a valuable mining claim and threatened
to. detain him and give him into cus
tody unless he accepted it. Thus co
erced he executed a deed, received the
money and continued his journey. Be
fore he reached the line he was cap
tured and soon afterward tried. Tha
homicide was unprovoked and inexcus

Was not the prayer answered? Who

good faith and of personal responsibil

Old Dipper Gourd is useful when tin cups are not handy,
And 'way down South where the Colonels are he associates with
brandy. *â¢ Â¦.,'
H, my precious dumplings, I am sure you'd like to
know 'â¢'.'
About the strange and funny Gourds and how they
do' and grow. i .. ' v â¢ \
It is said they are the oddest of the Kingdom's won-'
drous creatures, ... . â¢ â¢, â¢ - ;
And I'm sure you'd smile if you could "see their
funny forms and features.
Some are tall and lean and straight and some are small
and squatty,
One of the beauties of the lot imparts a fragrance sweet
When nestling in the pocket when you go upon the street.
It's gaudy in its colors gay, and its name is long to dwell on,
For it goes about as fair* Queen Anne's Sweet-Scented Pocket Melon.
Old Bottle Gourd is useful, and strong and stanch withal,
And he does not hurt or break himself whene'er he gets a fall.
Hercules Gourd is known to all as the giant of the lot.
For he stands a foot in his stocking feet, and he wears the stripe and
â¢ . spot.
Young Gourd Orange is one whose jolliest fun is to masquerade about
*
As an orange cf the sort that's good to eat â plump and rather stout.
But the one that has the greatest sport is Pear-Shaped Gourd so sleek,
And every housewife meets him, pets, at least one time a week.
His workshop is the holey sock, and there, when wifey darns.
He dreams in sweetest ecstacy of the fields and trees and farms.
There's a host of gourds petite and small, and 'tis said their greatest joys
Are to serve sweet children in their play as unbreakable little toys.
Here's a plan for the little girl who loves to draw and sew.
And if it's followed out I think the time won't go so slow:
Have dear Papa get for you a Gourd of the bottle shape,
And with colored chalk or pencils, eyes and nose and mouth you make.
Then measure the Gourd around the waist, and make a skirt to fit,
And I'm sure that if your work's done well you'll sit and sit and sit
And look at the Gourd all dressed in style, with its nose and mouth and
And afford Papa when he returns a glad and fine' surprise.
that beset one's pathway. If . all
these qualities be not inherent they
may be and must be cultivated.
Rather a host of qualifications, but the
boy to make a thorough success in
life must have them. ".
"Along your line of experience you
believe that a college career is of
vital necessity to a man who intends
to lead a business life? The question
of professions Is left out of the argu
ment. As you employ a large number
of men in almost every capacity, what
has been your observation as to the
adaptability of college men to busi
ness as compared with others?" I
asked.
Again he was silent It was a mat
ter, which he did not care to discuss
and he replied to Jhe question briefly:
' "I Co not believe that a college edu
cation is necessary to qualify a man
for a successful business career. I
think that it will be found that few
of the most brilliant business men,
tion. -But I will ...say, however, that
I do hot think that; the highest re
sults are to be obtained' by : the v addi
tional endowment of 'already rich col
leges and universities. 'It 1 : is all well
enough, perhaps, in j the first organi
zation of these institutions. ' I find
that a direct application .-.of aid to
enable â¢ young people^â particularly
girls without means â to prepare
themselves'for the unequal struggle In
life Is fruitful in gratifying results." ;
The Senator, inspVtaking of his love
for Montana, continued: ..'..''
"When a mere child in my native
State, Pennsylvania,' I was first in
spired with a love of adventure and a
desire to go to the wild West by hear
ing my father read the adventures of
Lewis and Clark, also a description of
the gold discoveries In California. This
invested that far off country with a
halo of romance in my mind that I
never wished to^ obliterate, and I em
braced the"- earliest -opportunity to
make my way to the frontier, where I
have passed ...over, forty years of miy
life. I love the grand old *Rocky
Mountains and I love my ovn State,
Montana,-' having contributed my
humble efforts since its first organiza
tion after my arrival upon its soil to.
build up a great commonwealth ' and
one of the proudest of this great na
tion.". \
i "What do you think of New York,
Senator? You have traveled exten
sively."
"New York possesses advantages
for an -American above all other
cities in the world. I like it. When
the f streets are improved and excava
ting is no longer necessary the
streets will be permanently fashioned
and New. York will Â¦ be 'something
pretty to look upon." , Â¦;/ .:.
Senator Clark has what Is doubt
less the most complete and rich
est collection of., pictures and tapes
tries owned by any individual. It is
his one fad. ' He has paid as high as
575,000 for a picture. Sixty-four are
stored in a -gallery in Vienna awaiting
the completion of the Fifth avenue
mansion. ' One Rousseau, Senator
Clark maintains, is that , artist's mas
terpiece, and it has been so proclaimed
by many art critics. The subject In
terests. Senator 'Clark intensely. He
was anxious to allow the "conversation
to, Â»*un to this subject. There was
.keen Joy. on 'his countenance as he
spoke.
"I was born with the, innate love of
the beautiful > in nature and in the
arts. Even in childhood I was at
tracted to all kinds of pictorial repre
sentation, and as I grew older I often
gazed with delight and fascination up
on beautiful landscapes in the pictur
esque region of Western ' Pennsylvania .
where I was born. I read books re
lating to art, -but had little opportu
' hity- to Inspect any paintings of a
high order until my first visit to New
jYork and Boston .In 1866. Ten
years later, at the Centennial at Phil
adelphia, I spent many hours of my
time In the art exhibits. In\1889 I
commenced my annual Â¦ visits to Eu
and suitable galleries wherein I may;
rope, and it was there,, in the great
galleries* Of England, France, Ger
'. many, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Hol
land, that I acquired a distinctive per
ceptlsn and correct notions and taste*
in painting, sculpture, architecture
/arid other beautiful' arts.' It was not,
however, until about sixteen years ago
that I began to make a collection.
Since that time I have acquired some
beautiful treasures, and with the ex
ception of one Instance, where I asked
the advice' of Dr. Breirius, of The
Hague, concerning the work of some
Dutch masters, with which I was then
not familiar, I have Invariably pur
chased pictures upon my own Judgment.
During my frequent sojourns in Eu
rope, I acquired some knowledge of
several languages, which were helpful
to me In many ways, but I claim to
have acquired a thorough reading,
speaking, and writing knowledge of
only one foreign language â French.
"Do you intend to live in New York,
particularly when you have finished
building the marble palace?"
!^WTille it is not my intention to re
linquish my home in Montana, my
business requires my presence here
several months in the year. I have
two daughters living* in New York,
and I concluded, in order to provide
a home for all members'of my family
display my pictures, tapestries, Per
sian carpets and other treasures, that
I would erect a house that should be a
model of perfection as near as may' be
of the French Renaissance of' the
Louls XIV period. With this end In
-view I secured the highest talent' in
Naw York and Paris. To carry this
but effectively I have been obliged to
purchase and equip a granite quarry
in i Maine and a bronze foundry in
New York.
- "Senator will you talk about the
copper industry, its future and pres
ent conditions?"
"Now, if you will excuse me on this
subject I will thank you. It !a a vast
subject I will say this much. Do
you icnow that 1,000,000,000 pounds of
copper is taken from the ground an
nually? Of this twenty- five per cent
comes from Montana. I am the larg
est individual owner of copper mine3
in the world. I produce about 75,
000,000 pounds a year. No, I don't
think there will be any period in the
near future when 'copper will be
scarce, but one can never tell. There
is no great amount of copper stored.
The consumption each year about
equals the production-. The world is
not getting ahead" very much In cop
per. It is a mineral that cannot be
overlooked and there is more demand
for It every day."
particularly in the Western country,
have had such advantages. This,
however, is probably accidental. A
reasonable degree of proficiency I
would consider absolutely necessary
to successful management of a busi
ness, and would consider that the
highest education possible is desirable
to flt a young man for atiy vocation in
life."
"You have the reputation, Senator,
of doing a great deal of philanthropic
work, quietly. What in your opinion
constitutes a philanthropist?"
"I do not care. to make any public
statement as to what I may choose to
do in the way of philanthropic work.
Unobtrusiveness, to my "mind, lends
one of the greatest charms to such
work."
"It has been stated, without contra
diction, that you contribute liberally,
to educational work. Will you state
in a general way your method of
conducting this feature of your busi
ness, and what line of educational
work appeals to you most and the ed
ucation of which sex?"
"I answer this question by applying
my remarks to your previous ques-

Pretty Dancer Loses Suit in Court,
but Wins Judge's Love.
BUDA-PESTII, Hungary. Dec. 26. â
Julia Tomaska. an operatic dancer,
was sued by the manager of the thea
ter at Nagy Arad for not dancing ac
cording to the best traditions of her
art and in consequence rendering his
theater unpopular. The manager had
a written contract with her providing
that she was to dance in certain
operas the traditional dances required
by the public.
Julia said in court that the public
taste was depraved and that her man
ner of. dancing was in accordance with
the highest rules of the terpsichorean
remain in hi3 room a few minutes, as
he wished to speak to her alon<?.
Miss Julia's surprise was great wh<*n
she received an offer of marriage from
the Judge, who 'had been fascinated
by her grace.

art.- The Jury would have liked to give
Judgment for Julia, as she Is a lovely
girl, and gave her evidence with much
animation and wit, but it could not
agree as to which side was right So
the Judge' asked the parties if they
would consent to try the case again
in his private room and submit the
matter to his final judgment. They
consented and a day was appainted for
the new trial.
The Judge said the only way he
could decide .was to see Julia dance
both styles of dancing. Julia was only
too willing and pirouetted in front of
the Judge to his complete satisfaction.
Then he felt, constrained to decide
t^at the theater manager was right
and that thenew dancing was no im
provement. When he gave -judgment
acainst the fair Julia he asked her to
undertaker's naive offer that he would
gladly liquidate the bill in exchange
for permission to use the title of Pur

â¢'My dear madam â I should value
splendid possibilities of the old Olym
pia were so long undiscovered. As it
' now" is -the opera-house is one of the
most admirably suited to its purposes
that could be devised. But therein
also is lost a 'music hall that would
have placed San Francisco on "a level
in this regard with almost any city
in the United States. The acoustics
are ideal. One can hear, as ' in the
Greek Theater at Berkeley, the light
est sound made by the performers
from the farthest seat In the topmost
gallery of the house. The view of the
stage also Is practically perfect from
all parts of the auditorium. Let us be
thankful, however, for an opera-house
fit to house Grau â or rather Herr Con

surely to make history that will make
us all yery pridefii* o't.
The question lÂ» now as to whether
there Is another Olympia going to
waste. It is hardly likely though.
Such opportunities don't offer twice.
In the. meantime, however, the Tivoli
will have to be hospitable. Obviously
it is the only place for the symphony
concerts â that are going to be given
somehow*, and with Melster Fritz
Scheei, beginning March next I had
hoped, by the way. to be able to give
particulars as to the symphony con
certs this week. Affairs, however, are
still too unsettled for any but the
definite information that they are to,
be given, through the efforts of a
number of music-loving citizens who
are working strenuously to that end.
But one can imagine the "Pathetlque"

stands this only as the new Tivoli was
not begun when her arrangements
were" made. But one would" like to
hear the famous singer under the most
favorable circumstances, which means
the Tivoli. In fact, there is nothing
musical that would not gain immeas
urably from the Sumptuously grateful
setting. The Tivoli is San Francisco's
most precious gift to music for many
years, worthy to be bracketed with
that Bplendid gift of the year to the
sister artâ the Greek Theater at
"Why did no one think of it be
fore?"
Probably every one who has seen
the new Tivoli will wonder why the
up then finally. I went from there to
the Prince of Wales Theater, as lead
ing barytone in. 'Blue-eyed Susan,'
then to the Lyric in 'Inoognita' and
Goring Thomas, 'The Golden Web'â
I wish we* could have that here. It is
a lovely thing. But it failed through
an absence of low comedy, I believe.
'La Basoche' would be another fine
thing for the Tivoli. We could do it,
too. Then I was in 'The Magic O*pal'
â that Lord Francis Hope financed for
May Yohe. I dLdn't tell you of 'The
Gondoliers' at Windsor Castle, did L
in my Savoy experiences?" he suddenly
asked.
I nodded a negative and -the bary
tone said: "I never felt so ludicrously
small in my life as on that occasion.
It was the first comic opera given at
Windsor Castle since the Prince. Con
sort's . death in 1861 â twenty-eight
years later, in 1889. But you remem
ber 'The Gondoliers?' I had to sit
there on a throne, with the people all
kneeling to me with their backs to
Queen Victoria â by Jove, I felt like a
silly ass. It was a fine performance,
though. We had Geraldine Ulmer
and Jessie Bond â Jessie Bond distin
guished 'herself, by the way. The
ladies dressed in the throne room, and
nothing would do but Jessie must sit
on the throne of England. And sit
she did, in a costume that no Queen
of England has ever worn."
"And now, I ' haven't forgotten
Africa, Mr. Brownlow."
Â¦ "I hoped you had," exclaimed the
barytone. "You see I never said any
thing about that in Australia â â "
"That's their fault," I laughed.
"But was it real fighting? Where?"
"W*ell." he resigned himself, "if I
must. But It has nothing to do with
the case. I. want to be -known as a
Einger, not a soldier. That was a long
time ago, too. People will be asking
my age, don't .you know! # But I went
into the Cape Mounted" Rifles as a
private at 18 and was a lieutenant at
21. My fighting .was in Basutoland
and the corner rebellion of the Zulu
land war. That's .all."-
, "Oh, that's all! Didâ anything hap
pen?"
Mr. Brownlow stretched out^ his
richt hand, where one white mark
gleams at the knuckle, another at the
wrist, and said simply: "it went in
there and came out here." He showed
a bent little finger on the left hand,
and remarkod: "And there's a charge
of buckshot somewhere in ray ribs! I
believe."
Then I shook the hand where "it
went in ' here and came out there,"
IX THE MUSICAL WORLD.
"No," the barytone replied regret
fully. "We did Messager's 'La
Basoche* after 'Ivanhoe' â Frederick
Cowen's opera that was to follow be
ing still in the stocRs. I alternated in
the buffo role with Bispham "
"That speaks very well for 'Brown
low,' " I thought, and aloud said: "Bis
pham ia delightful, isn't he?"
"Yes, but there was another bary
tone singing then that I think was the
finest I ever heard â he sang the Tem
plar Sir Brian BoisrGilbert in 'Ivan
hoe* â Eugene Oudin, I mean. I have
humbly tried to model myself on his
Iine3."
"By the way, with whom did you
study?"
"Never had a lesson in my life," Mr.
Brownlow amazed me with.
"Do you mean that literally?" I
asked. The person that '.'never had a
lesson in his 'life" is an old acquaint
ance in many walks of art. But one
doesn't find him doing the things that
count.
"Quite literally," the barytone in
sisted. Then he earnestly outlined his
vocal credo something as follows: "I
cannot see how a teacher can teach
you how even to 'place' â as it is called
âyour voice. lie is really familiar
only with his own vocal machinery,
and cannot possibly enter fully into
the intricacies of yours. He can tell
you, true, the natural way of placing:
a voice, but you really have to do the
rest. And you can. If a man will
take the tnfuble to be his own critic,
to analyze himself, and not kg -ound
with an elongated arm patting him
solf on the back" â Mr. Brownlow's
arm here solemnly reached over to his
cervical vertebraeâ "he can do all
that is necessary. But he must take
his performances to pieces all the
time. He must find out their weak
ness and the cause of it, and listen,
listen, listen always to other singers.
He must learn why certain things
please and other things displease his
public and act accordingly. As to the
technical side, I think we ought to
sing as the birds sing. We were
meant to. If you can't sing you
shouldn't. I believe a 'made* voice is
always inclined to go wrong. Mind
you, I'm not posing as an authority. ,1
couldn't explain how I sing â only to
say by emitting a' sound through my
mouth. You see, it's a method of my
ov/n."
, And here, vocal teachers and pupils,
is an example of the self-taught singer
âthe singer who literally "never had
a lesson in his life." I heard Mr.
Brownlow as Apollo at the Tivoli
opening on Wednesday, but there was
too little of him, and the circum
stances were inopportune^ for jud,g
ment of that little. The next produc
tion, "When Johnny Comes Marching
Home," will, however, afford excel
lent opportunity to measure the bary
tone's accomplishment.
I asked then: ( "Ho\v, was Mr.
Cowen's operaâ that followed "La
Basoche?'"
"Oh, it was never given," the bary
tone replied. "D'Oyly Carte asked us
after 'La Basoche' to release him from
the contracts. I had just signed for
three years with him, too. No, the
scheme was a failure, and was given
given in the Royal English Opera
house. You remember the play?
D'Oyly Carte was at the head of it,
and it was intended to be a continuous
performance of grand opera, all by
English composers â a kind of na
tional home of ppera. 'Ivanhoe' was
.the first work produced. It ran for
150 nights. But Sullivan put me
through my paces â bo kindly â and I
managed to sing Prince John in two
days without falling down. In fact,
with some success."
"And the national home of opera is
no more?'"
"This is Mr. Browr.low. Miss Part
ington." The office at the Orpheum
was the place of tryst. As the inter
viewer and victim acknowledged the
introduction. I was further enlightened
that "Mr. Brownlow does not like to be
'mistered,* by the way."
"No, rotten bad form, don't you
know," the new Tivoli barytone cheer
fully agreed. He frankly mopped a
very rink brow and continued: "AH
men are equals, aren't they?â andâ isn't
it very warm to-day?"
"How deliciously feudal!â andâ not
mcrre so than usual at this time of
the year," I commented, and informed
him. Mr. Brownlow is English, by
way of Australia for the last ten years,
and only a two-months-old Californian.
With glaring: su peril uousness, I ask
him: "But you come from where they
say. 'A green yule makes a fat church
yard'?"
"Haven't been in London for ten
years." the barytone replied. "Too long.
But Australia! I tell you it's- jolly
funny Fittins down to plum pudding
and turkey with the thermometer at
100 degrees in the shade, and panto
mimes iroing on all around."
"Nat Goodwin told me. that they be
lieve in London that there were buffa
loes on Broad > /. I'm afraid we be
lieve here that you have kangaroos in
Melbourne." I began.
".Not cuite." he laughed.
"You liked it there?"
"Wry much," was the hearty re
f-i'onse. 'They told me when I left that
they would be glad to welcome me back
at any time. It is very pleasant to feel
that one has not outsung one's favor
in ten years."
"You were singing all the time in
Australia?"
"When I was not mining," was the
unexpected reply â though there is that
about "Brownlow" that should pre
clude surprise at such history. Like
every other actor who is an actor, he
iff less like one than he is like every one
e!pe. Possibly it was because I knew
that he had been soldiering in South'
Africa, but I thought his keen blue eyes
looked as though they were much more
used to a hair trigger than a s
foot, his poodly sSx feet or so to the
saddle than to a pasteboard throne.
Neither does the Brownlow complexion,
still cf English freshness in spite of
Australian droughts, at all suggest the
footlights, nor yet the business-like
parb of the ringer. Even less "actory,"
if possible, is Mr. Brownlow's simple,
direct manner.
"Yes, I was mining for three years."
he added, "then I went back to the
stage."
"Not until"â he laughed a little sadly
hereâ "not until I lost what I got out
of the ground In speculating."
"You were with Williamson, of
course?" â every one is in Australia.
"Yes," Mr. Brownlow answered, and
added: "Williamson Is what you might
call the Frohman of Australia.
He produces all the Frohman and
George Edwardes things there, while
they are still running In New York and
London. We're just- through a ion*?
run of 'My Lady Molly' and 'The
Toreador.' "
..Â»it
"Oh yes. there aren't kangaroos
enough to go round. We have to amuse
ourselves somehow!"
VBut we haven't had 'My Lady
Molly' in New York yet."
"Really!" the Australian chuckled.
"Perhaps you will get things sooner
if the rumored deal between George
Edwardes, Williamson and Frohman
goes through. I believe they are to
< ombine. Seriously, though, Austra
lia is a pretty up-to-date place. They
copy America, you know. It is alto
pc-ther more American than English
there. â¢ â¢ â¢ An engagement with
Williamson in a very pleasant affair.
It is for all the year round, you know-
He has a circuit â something like the
Orpheumâ that includes Perth. Bris
bane, Sydney, Melbourne and Ade
laide, the chief cities, end there we
Ein *-" , ,..
"This is in light opera only?'
"Yes, but we have English and
Italian grand opera companies there
quite frequently."
"Benedetto and Travaplini of the
last Tivoli season were there â "
"Oh. Benedetto!" and Brownlow
laughingly shaped a very buxom outÂ»
line of the plump prima. "I remem
ber her." He is much more given to
posture than the average Englishman.
"How do you produce Brand opera
there; how much of a chorus - and
so on?"
"Sixty in the chorus usually, and an
orchestra of thirty-six,'" the barytone
estimated; "very well mounted, too."
"And at what prices?"
"Five shillings, three shillings, two
shilling and one shilling."
This, considering distances. America
is 7000 miles nearer the base of oper
atic supplies than Australia (thank
you. Mr. Brownlow!), is even more rea
sonable than the Tivoli.
"Of course when Melba -jjivt-s a con
cert the prices boom," the barytone
added. "People will pay the'r guineas
and half guineas to hear her."
"Melba is very popular?"
"She is not"â Mr. Brownlow's beaver
brown brows went up drolly hereâ "she
t* not so great an idol as she says she
is. I saw something about her in M.
A. P. once that amused me greatly.
The London papers all had a lot of wild
stuff about Melfca Just about thenâ"
"Evtn a ' reDorter will turn, Mr.
Brownlow. Ore hears so much of the
unreliability of the American newspa
per from England, that it really does
not hurt to hear the other side. Eut
about MeJba?"
"M. A. P. had it that Melba wasn't
i?coor>ing in all the profits of her tour
for herself, but to build 'another wing
on the Melbourne hospital!" If Mr.
Ero'.vnlow had been a woman he
would have sniffed here. "There has
not been anything about that wing
since. There isn't any foundation
laid, nothing done. It is possible that
Melba may have given a thousand or
two thousand dollars for such pur
pose. Not moreâ or we should cer
tainJy have heard of it! Now, I'll tell
you some one who IS popular down
there â Antonia Dolores."
"We like her very much here." .
"But the crowd will stand outside
the theater and cheer her â they like
her for her sweetness and simplicity
as well as her singingâ as they never
cheer Melba. Ill tell you what I've
seen. I've seen Dolores follow Melba
the same week and pack the houses,
where Melba has had only half a
house. Nellie Stewartâ 'our Nellie,'
they call her â is another great Aus
tralian favorite. She is the most ac
complished all-round actress I ever
knew. She was the recognized prima
donna for twenty years down there,
and has now turned to the drama.
She is leading woman in plays like
'Zaza,' and equally successful as in
opera. There's a woman now you
could justly say is a thousand times
more popular than Melba. But all
this rather makes me out an Aus
tralian, and â "
"It's greatly to. his credit ; that he
is an Englishman," I laughed. "Oh, I
know that you were^with Gilbert and
Sullivan, also that you fought in South
Africa "
"But â it isn't necessary to talk
about Africa." Lieutenant Brownlow
carries honorable scars from Zulu
land, but he certainly looked like run
ning away at this moment.
"We'll take the Savoy first," I tem
porized. "You know Teddy Webb was
an accomplice of yours in those
days?"
"Well, I was in the same 'Mikado'
company as Teddy Webb, that came
to America in 1885," the barytone con
fessed. "We were both understudies
â I for the Mikado, Webb for Koko.
I made my first American appearance
then. It was awful! I knew then, for
the first and only time, what stage
fright is. I shivered like a dog in tha
December rain. I wasn't allowed to
play the part again and I don't blame
the management! There wasn't even
this," and the barytone patted I one
limp palm with the other to Illustrate-.
*' 'The understudy's lot is not a hap
py one, happy one,' " I quoted." "Tell
me something about the Gilbert and
Sullivan regime at the Savoy. Did
you begin as a singer?" '
"My first appearance was as a
comic policeman." Brownlow replied,
"with a bogus manager named Mat
thews Monk. I got a pound a week â
most of the timeâ and slept in the
greenroom with the rugs off the floor
over me to save expenses.- If I raised
sixpence for dinner I was lucks'. By
Jove! this is a good one, too! I'll tell
you who was in the same company,
a dashing juvenille then â Lawrence
d'Orsay. He made a bully Due de
Nemours. I hear he has a swagger
position in 'The Earl of Pawtucket!'
He may perhaps be interested to know
that another member of that miser
able company is still on deck. How is
he?"
"The only king I ever saw that
looked the part," I testified. "A sec
ond Dundreary those say who knew
the elder Sothern."
"Well, well, I'd like to see him. No,
I '.vent afterward to the Savoy on the
advice of some other poor devils that
Monk exploited-*â principally because
Mr. Monk happened to fall down
stairs after a little argument we had"
â the Brownlow fists squared them
selves here. "I was immediately en
gaged there for 'Princess Ida.' "
"In the chorus of the road com
pany. I had four years of that and
then went up to London, judging the
opportunities better there. One heard
there all the good people, and. the
chances as understudy were much
better â they had first, second and
third understudies there, and the ri
valry was very keen. My first real
chance came â you really want to
know? â in a 'front piece,' 'The Carp.'
We played that fish for two years until
he was positively er " \
I waited for the characteristic "rot
ten," but instead Mr. Brownlow de
cided charmingly to put It "putrid."
"Then came." he continued, "an ap
pearance as the lieutenant in the
'Yeoman of the Guard.' Grossmith
was the sergeant, I remember â that
was his last engagement with Gilbert,
by the way."
"They had been long associated?"
"All of those parts, the Mikado and
fo on were written to fit Grossmithâ
in fact all of the Gilbert parts were
written round particular personali
ties."
"That's Interesting, in view of the
dictum that the drama is suffering
from the written-to-flt play."
"That was always Gilbert's habit,"
Mr. Brownlow insisted. "But Gros
smith and he fell out very curiously.
Gilbert insisted on one being an au
tomaton. Individuality had no play at
all â except his. Every inflection had
to be made according to his judgment.
GroFsmith.. it seemed, couldn't â or
wouldn't â inl'ect one sentence he had,
where he had to say: 'Suppose I were
to sit down on something sharp' â I re
ply: 'Kit on the spur of the move
mentâ' But there was a Touchstone*
gesture and an Inflection that ho didn t
get- We rehearsed for four mornings
on that sentence!"
"I gather that Gilbert was no great
favorite?" â¢
"No, he wasn't. He was one of the
worst would-be cynics that ever hap
pened. Didn't mind whom he hurt if
he could be funny. He would aim at
being funny and succeed oniy In being
personal. Tremendously clever chap,
though." *
"You haven't any more at home like
them," I quote. "But Sullivan was
just as amiable as Gilbert wasn't."
"There is only one word that fits the
'little master' â that's what we all
called him and that is 'sweet.' He
was absolutely 'sweet* in dlapjsition."
There was a very graceful and grate
ful homage in* Mr. Brownlow!s tone.
"He was the most courteous of men,
and generous! â he would give away
everything he had to those in need,
lie pulled me throughâ but I must
tell you that while I was playing in
'The Yeoman of the Guard,' they
came to me on Saturday night and
gave me the part of Prince John in
'Ivanhoe,' to sing on the Monday night
following!"

WITH THE PLAYERS AND THE MUSIC FOLKThe Petite Republique of Paris, M.
Faure's personal organ, has lately
been giving an account of the growth
of socialism In Japan. Efforts to or
ganibe the "proletariat" have met with
the stubbornest opposition from the
Government, the leaders in the- move
ment having been arrested, prosecut
ed and punished. One paper ha3 al
ready been confiscated. The whole
tendency of Japanese socialism, says
Petite Republique, is against the new
ly discovered "nationalism" and "jin
goism" which demands war with Rus
sia. So strong, however, is this sen
timent that socialism has been able
to make little headway. â New - York

Some of our fair San Francisco wo

who have also been a great credit to
us. Now the Western girl heads the
list of successful chauffeurs.. The
American girl in general has an ad
vantage in temperament by inheri
s nee that the Latin races can never

Fubstantiate my claim that chauffeurs

The society woman has come to re
gard an automobile as necessary to
her happiness andâ more than thatâ a

be seen In the latest mode of locomo
tion. She no longer stays indoors to
make lece. but goes out for a spin to
kill time. Her most important
ambition is to become adept In
managing the machine herself, and
this is something of a gift. To drive
an automobile one must have quick
perception, swift decision, good concen
tration, a level head in all emergencies
and some mechanical genius. You
might have ever so massive a mind,
but be unable to start the wheels of
your mental machinery with lightning
rapidity, in which case you would soon
be in serious trouble â th*it is if
there happened to be a tree just
ahead of the automobile. But money
is the only obstacle to be considered.
If you have plenty of that, skill is Im
material. If you have an automobile
fast enough, handsome enough and
heavy enough, you are fairly certain of
keeping right side up with care, for one
can always hire chauffeurs and there
are r.ot many weak 6pots in the make
up of the newest machines.

Japan to Send Lar^c Military Force
Witli Russia's Acquiescence.
PARIS, Dec. 26. â It was learned in
authoritative quarters to-day that
Japan is about to send a large mili
tary force to Korea to restore and
maintain order at the disturbed ports.
The departure of this force is immi
nent. It probably will consist of a di
vision of 13,000 men-
Japan has been assured that Rus
ria "will not consider the sending of
troops to Korea as an unfriendly act
or a casus belli. It is expected that
the departure of the troops will revive
the war rumors, which, however, it is
pointed out in the authoritative quar
ter, would be unjustified, in view of
Russia's acquiescence.
During the recent exchanges of com
munication between Russia and Japan
the former fully recognized the need
of the presence of a strong military
.â¢iuthority in Korea, and conceded that
Japan was in the best position to
promptly send troops to the disturbed
points.
The sending of troops, nevertheless,
U_ construed as having an important
faring on the present negotiations, as
it will be the first conspicuous evidence
of Japan's actual exercise of para
amount authority over Korea.
It is further said in the same quar

KANAB, Utah, Dec. 26.â Ranchmen
and cowbeys ha\e been coming all day
from every portion of Southwestern
Utah and the neighboring territory in
â¢Arizona and Nevada to attend the great
annual hunt of wild horses which is
to occur to-morrow. About 150 men
are here now and fifty more are ex
pected to arrive by to-morrow morning.
While the number of wild equines is
less than ever before in nearly a half
century, still there is the same keen
interest in the exciting spert and, more
than ever' before, the ranchmen feel
the need of exterminating the bands
of free horses that' roam this part of
the country. The animals exhaust the
range that is required for cattle and
also attract to their wild and unpro
ductive bands the horses wanted for
ranch purposes and which have been
turned loose to graze on the range.
Preparations for the hunt are com
plete. Robert Moran, a prominent
ranchman of Southwestern" l T tah, is
to "bos3" the day. assisted by a half
dozen expert cowboys as sub-captains.
The men will start before daybreak
and scout among the hills until a band
of wild horses is encountered. The
hunters 'will be armed with rifles. If
possible the horses will be. driven into
some '"blind" canyon, where the work
of slaughter will be made easy.
Not all the animals are killed, as
there are always some that are of con
siderable value. .The herds of small,
wild ponies 'that originally galloped
over the ranges were recruited from
many emigrant trains in the old pio
neer days and some of the animals that
thus changed servitude for the llberty
of the hills were of fine breed. The
result was the production of a large
number of high grade horses that,
Â¦when captured and "broke," are of
more than ordinary value. These- are
segregated, when possible, from the or
dinary "scrub" rnimals that are ruth
lessly slaughtered.
After the day's hunt the men will
return to a camp previously prepared
and in. the evening they will celebrate
the event with a great barbecue. The
horses not killed will be divided among
the hunters by the drawing of lots or
the shaklns of dice.

SURGEONS REACH SCENE.
The trains met with a terrific crash,
the baggage and smoking cars behind
each locomotive being reduced to
kindling. wood. The engines were com
pletely wracked, the boiler of the one
which had pulled the eastbound train
Â¦being torn completely from the running
gear and standing perpendicularly in a
ditch at the side of the track.
Engineer Frank Waterman, who sur
vived the catastrophe, says he and E.
B. Moon, the fireman, were caught bs-~
fore they had time to save themselves.
He says he did not' see the' eastbound
train until the crash came. With' few
exceptions no persons occupying cars
other than the baggage and smoking
cars were seriously injured.
Within two minutes the uninjured
male passengers and those of the train
crew who had ; not been hurt had begun
the work of rescue. Traveling Agent
Frank Hewitt of the Pere Marquette,
who was on the train Wund for De
troit, and who escaped with slight in
juries, ran to the nearest telegraph of
fice and telegraphed for a wrecking
train and surgeons. Guided by groans
and tries frcm the wrecked cars, the
rescuers, by the light of lanterns,
delved into the wreckage, and, with
fence timbers for levers, pried out tke
sufferers.
The officials deny the report that a
misunderstanding of orders on the part
of one of the engineers was responsi
ble for the collision. According to the
statement of the officials the trains
were originally to have met and pass
ed at Oakdale Park, but to help the
eajtbound train the dispatcher issued
new orders, fixing Fox as the meeting

WORK ON TRANSPORTS.
The activity in the matter of get
ting transports ready for sea is arous
ing much speculation in army circles.
Why the transports in the harbor are
being placed in condition to go into
immediate commission has not been
given out by any of the authorities
here. The orders from Washington
seem to be of a most Imperative na
ture, as the three available ships, the
Crook, Sherman and Buford, are now
being placed in seagoing shape with
all expediency possible. The Crook,
which has been lying up for the last
year, while in practically good shape,
needed a lot 6f work to put her in
thorough condition. Concerning her
the orders from Washington were not
only explicit, but imperative. She
was pulled alongside Steuart-street
dock on Friday and on Monday morn
ing early she will go on the drydock,
w.here she will receive a complete and
thorough overhauling. Contracts were
let yesterday for some few slight re
pairs that were needed to her ma
chinery. Under the general contract
for having her placed in seagoing con
dition she must be ready for sea about
January 7. The Sherman needed
practically little attention and she
will be incondition to sail on Decem
ber 31.
The Buford, which has been await
ing orders for a year or more, is in
fine shape. She went on the drydock
yesterday morning and at daybreak
on Monday she. will be moved out.
She will be ready to go into commis
sion January 3.
Major Devol took a tug yesterday
and spent the greater part of the day
in thoroughly inspecting the three
transports. He said they were all in
excellent condition. He had nothing
to say regarding any advice or any
knowledge he had received concern
ing the future movements of these
vessels. Of course, the rumor that
receives the greatest amount of cre
dence is to the effect that the vessels
are being made ready to convey troops
to Panama in case affairs there should
come to a sudden crisis. On the other
hand, one official high In military au
thority stated that he did not think,
even in case of any sudden change in
the situation in Panama, troops would
be sent from this department, as it
would be far more expedient' to send
them direct from Eastern points, the
â¢distance from New York to Aspinwall
being only about half of the distance
from* this port to Panama. Still an
other rumor was that Uncle Sam had
bought a big quantity of supplies for
the Philippines and that the trans
ports would be required to take them
out. At any rate the ships are being
placed in readiness as fast as possible
and in a few days will be ready to re
spond to the call of the Government,
whatever that call may be.

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 26. â Final
preparations have been made for the
sailing, of the auxiliary cruiser Dixie
and on Monday she will leave the
League Island navy yard with 600
marines for Colon. To-day 100 men
came from Annapolis in charge of
Captain William Hopkins and Lieu
tenant Frederick D. KHgore and 100
additional marines arrived from Bos
ton in command of Captain George W.
Reid and Lieutenant Davis Wills. To
morrow 192 men from New York and
ninety-six from Washington will com
plete the battalion which will pro

The force will be commanded by
Brigadier General G. T. Elliott, who
will arrive from Washington to-mor
row. The Dixie has been equipped to
maintain 1000 men for a period of
five months. ,
DIXIE IS READY TO SAIL.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26. â The
withdrawal of marines from the isth
mus of Panama to be begun soon after
the ratification of the Panama canal
treaty by the Senate has been deter
mined upon. . They, will be replaced,"
however, by a permanent garrison of
soldiers. Plans for accomplishing
this project- are now under consider
ation by the War and Navy depart
ments. At the present time the ma
rines are used as police under the
treaty of 1846, which requires this
country to maintain free of interrup
tion the line of transit across the isth
mus. Under the new treaty the Unit
ed States guarantees to maintain the
independence of the republic of Pan
ama.
Army officers say that it will re
quire several thousand soldiers to
properly carry out these obligations
and unless some agreement be reach
ed with Colombia by which all dan
ger of invasion of the isthmus is re
moved this country will have to pro
vide for several large permanent gar
risons on the isthmus.
Apart from these plans, the general
staff of the army continues prepara
tions for the immediate dispatch of
troops in case of trouble with Colom
bia, before the permanent occupation
of the canal strip.
A telegram was sent several days
ago to the headquarters of the De
partment of California asking how
many transports were available for
use. A reply has been received, say
ing that three ships can be made
ready within a few days. Orders to
be sent to certain regiments to hold
themselves in readiness are in course
of preparation, but will not be issued
unless the situation on the isthmus
assumes a more serious phase.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.â Unless the
United States, in the reply which Sec
retary Hay will make to the note of
General Reyes, accords Colombia that
measure of satisfaction which, from
her point of view she feels herself en
titled to with respect to Panama, both
General Reyes and Dr. Herran will
leave this capital. This was frankly
admitted to-night.
While disavowing any intention of
bringing undue pressure to bear upon
Secretary Hay for a speedy reply to the
note which General Reyes has present
ed in behalf of his Government, both he
and Dr. Herran are most anxious to be
apprised of the Secretary's conclusions
at the earliest possible moment. With
the view of obtaining light on this
point. Dr. Herran, the Colombian
Charge, to-day twice called at the resi
dence of Hay, but was unable to see
him on account of his continued illness.
The hope is entertained by both Gen
eral Reyes and Dr. Herran that, in the
event of a refusal by Hay to admit
their contentions, the United States
may agree as a last resort to a sub
mission of the propositions to The
Hague court of arbitration. It was
pointed out that the filing of the note
was in accordance with the treaty of
1846 between the United States and Co
lombia, one of the provisions of which
gives the contracting party, feeling ag
grieved at the action of the other, the
right to protest, with the further stip
ulation that a reply shall be forthcom
ing. It is said that Hay has not indi
cated when he will make answer to the
Colombian note.

"WASHINGTON, Dec. 26. â Indian
Inspector Jenkins is at the Colville
Indian agency, Washington, investi
gating charges against Indian Agent
A. M. Anderson. The charges include
alleged irregularities in vouchers ex
ecuted some time ago. There are a
number of other charges, including
some growing out of religious difficul
ties. The Indians in the Coeur d'Alene
agency, Idaho, which is under the
same administration as the ! Colvllle
agency, are regarded by the depart
ment as being in need of but little su
pervision, owing to their progressive
ness, and Its separation from Colville
agency and the appointment of a sub
agent there has been urged. It is
probable that a Government farmer

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26. â Follow
ing a long conference to-day with Sen

the latter's Interest in a building
leased to the Government for the
postoffice in Cheyenne, Wyo., Post
master General Payne intimated that
the case was closed. He* said that
before the expiration of a previous
lease on March 1, 1899, the lessors
wanted the rent raised from $1400 to
$1900, which Postmaster General
Charles Emory Smith deemed exor
bitant and he caused an investigation
to be made.
According to the records an agent
for Senator Warren, In the Senator's
absence, then executed a lease for a
building affording much better quar
ters for $1200 a year, for ten years,
beginning April 1, 1899. Payne said
that this would have saved the Gov
ernment in ten years $7000.
The postoffice probably will remain
in its present quarters until the com
pletion of a Government building at
Cheyenne, which is expected to be
ready for occupancy probably by July
next.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26. â So per

the cases arising in the State Depart

citizenship that Assistant Solicitor
Frederick Van Dyne has compiled in
a 400-page volume all the decisions
of. State and national courts and of

matter. The volume is to be placed
in the hands of United States Co'n
suls, immigrant Inspectors and other
United States officials who are called
upon to pass upon questions of citi

The publication of the work is
deemed essential because of the fact
that this subject has increased in im

development of a nation as a world
power. The great extension of com
merce which has marked the past dec
ade and the recent additions to - our
territory have been made inevitable
a broader compact with the nations

relations with the governments and

ROME, Dec 26. â The Osservatore
Romano, the Vatican organ, contains
another and it is considered more Im
portant answer to that part of the
speech of Count Goluchowskl, the Aus
trian Minister, delivered on December
16, which referred to the veto of Aus
tria against Cardinal Rampolla at the
late conclave.
The paper saya that the Holy See is
studying measures to prevent the prac
tical or theoretical use of the right of
the veto in conclaves. The substance
of the article (which la attributed to
Pope Plus) is that the changed political
and religious conditions to-day render
unbearable the veto, which in the past
the church prudently tolerated. When
the civil and ecclesiastical powers were
strictly united, the article says, the
sovereigns of Austria, France and Spain
were the right arm of Catholicism,
often making the church pay dear for
their protection, but rendering alto
gether signal service. Therefore, it con T
tinues, they were relatively justified In
having a persona grata as Pope. But
to-day, when governments make open
profession of atheism, persecute the
church with iniquitous laws and pro
claim the complete separation of civil
and .ecclesiastic powers, to pretend to
influence a papal election is arbitrary
and an injustice repugnant to modern
conscience, besides the constitutional
government's veto is no longer in the
hands of sovereigns, but in those of
men often without faith. The article
concludes:
"What Goluchowskl did, to-morrow
might be done by M. Combes."
After the reception Mr. Bryan took
the night train for Amsterdam.. He will
sail for New York Wednesday from
Liverpool on board the White Star line
steamship Celtic.
"In my meeting with the citizens of
my country sojourning abroad I have
been relieved of one of the fears I had
in 1896. I was afraid if I was not elect
ed it might be difficult to find good men
outside of the Democratic party to rep
resent us abroad, but I have found so
many good Americans, and Republi
cans, too, who honor their country irk
diplomatic and consular positions that
I will go back relieved of one of my
fears. I desire to acknowledge my
gratitude to the representatives of my
country everywhere."
On his return to the United States It
Is said Mr. Bryan will advocate a bill
at Washington providing that the
United States Government shall build
houses for its Embassadors and Minis
ters.
BERLIN, Dec. 26.â William J. Bryan
was entertained at luncheon to-day by
Embassador Tower and called on For*
eign Secretary Richthofen. Emperor
William has expressed regret at the
fact that domestic Christmas festivitiei
will prevent him from receiving Mh
Bryan in audience.
About one hundred Americans and
distinguished Germans were introduced
to Mr. Bryan to-day at the reception
of the American Chamber of Commerce
given in his honor at the Hotel Bristol,
after which Mr. Bryan in a speech said:
NEW YORK, Dec. 26. â The Finan
cier says this week: The striking feat
ure of the " official statement of the
New York associated banks last week
was the increase of $13,522,600 in
loans. This was notable chiefly be
cause of the fact that loan expansion
in the last weeks of the year is quite
unusual, banks generally being in no
condition to extend liberal accommo
dation to, borrowers until after the
turn of the new year. The excellent
reserve condition of the institutions in
the previous week and the accumula
.tion of funds in the banks in anticipa
tion of the disbursement of interest
and dividends immedaitely after the
beginning of the year, doubtless en
couraged liberal lending, which will
account for the above-noted increase.
Cash reserves increased by the net
amount of $2,295,800, the specie gain
being $3,264,800, while the legal ten
der loss was $307,000; the increase in
specie largely reflected payments for
imported gold during the week. The
deposits were augmented $17,634,700,
or $1,154,300 in excess of the total of
the gain In loans and in cash; hence,
the statement showed a good balance.
The required reserve was increased,
through the higher deposits, by $4.
408,675. Deducting therefrom the net
gain in cash leaves $1,450,875 as the
decrease in surplus reserve to $12,574,
625. Calculated upon the basis of de
posits less those of $36,849,800 public
funds, the surplus is $21,786,950. The
statement was doubtless made on ris
ing averages for cash, there having
been paid by the assay office on Fri
day $1,250,000, in addition to the
amount disbursed for the week's as
say of bullion, this amount represent
ing balances due on previous assays;
the above-named sum counted for only
one day. or one-flfth of the amount in
the statement. The daily average of
clearings for five days was $201,000,
000, against $197,000,000 in the pre
vious week, indicating increased busi
ness in the commercial markets, and
also some of the changes incident to
the close of the year; the clearings on
Saturday representing Thursday's
transactions were $236,674,721, or
much above the average. One minor
feature of the statement was a de
crease of $731,700 in circulation. The
loans were In excess of the deposits by
$26,344,100. Comparisons of loans
show that nine of the largest banks
increased this item by $12,200,000.
Seven of these institutions gained $2,
400,000 net in cash. . - \ â¢â¢- o

for thirty years in hospitals and at bedsides I
searched for a way to cure deep-seated and
difficult diseases. It tells how I perfected my
prescription â Dr. Snoop's Restorative. How
by scientific experiments 1 traced out tha causes
that brinr on chronic diseases.
I found invariably that where there was a
weakness the Inside nerves were weak.
Where there was a lack of vitality that the
vital nerves lacked power.
Where weak organs were found I always
found weak nerves.
Not the nerves commonly thought of, but the
vital organs' nerves. The Inside^ â the Invisible
nerves.
This waa a revelation.
Â¦ Then my real success be^an.
V Then I combined Ingredients that would
strengthen â that would vitalize these nerves.
That prescription I called a restorative. It
is known the world over now as Dr. Shoop's
Restorative. After that I did not fail to cure
one In each hundred. In the extremely diffi-
cult cases my failures for five years were only
one in each forty treated. I found cancer in-
curable. Cancer is for surerery. not medicine.
Then how to get this prescription to the sJck
ones everywhere wa3 my thought.
I must announce It In the public press. But.

my discovery â the real Dower of Dr. Shoop's

"Then they will know I am sincere."

Around "Cape Flat Iron," at Broad

Here ore man was dangerously hur*
by being struck with a fragment of a
large plate glass window, blown out of
an adjacent building.
Toward evening the wind, which had
at times attained a velocity of sixty
miles an hour, died down, the mercury
continuing to drop until at 10 o'clock
it touched 7 degrees above zero, with

NEW YORK, Dec. 26.â A driving
snowstorm, accompanied by furious
squalls that at times rose to almost
hurricane force, struck this city early
to-day. Lowering black clouds pressed
down on a bank of sea fog and ' the
dense character of the snowfall com
bined to produce for nearly half an
hour so deep a darkness that- lights
were lit in 'all the downtown streets
and along the water front. During
this period many ferry-boats and other
craft lost their bearings completely and
the harbor resounded with the whistles
of vessels cautiously groping their way
through the gloom. The Brooklyn boat,
heading for the Manhattan side, found
herself off the Battery, several blocks
away from her slip. Ocean steamers
bound in and out were compelled to
stop and lie to until the darkness lifted.
The ferry-boat John G. Carlisle, carry
ing immigrants from Ellis Island,
craslfed into the steamboat Tauras off
the Battery, but both vessels escaped
with slight damage. The darkness lift
ed almost as quickly as it settled down
and the snow was succeeded by clear
ing skies, high gales and a rapidly fall
ing temperature, the mercury going
down 15 degrees, from 34 to 19, within
three hours. So fierce was the gale
during the afternoon that many pedes
trians were thrown down and in some
instances were seriously injured.

A Little Sailor Like This for *3,50 1
Maybe you were so busy before Christmas you did not have time to
buy your boy a new suit. Better have it ready for New Year's. Let him
start the year with a brand new suit.
r It is to be presumed that you are now economizing because Christmas
buying takes so much money. You will appreciate trading here because
your dollars 'go so far.
If your boy is from three to ten years of age we can fit him in a swell
little sailor suit as shown above for $3.50. The suits are made of a fine
blue serge, neatly trimmed in different styles.. The suit is one of our
leaders. You will find one like it $5.00 in other- stores who do not make
their own goods, but buy from manufacturers.
For boys from six to twelve years old we have made a number, of very
stylish Norfolk suits from a durable navy blue cheviot. We have also manu-
factured an extra pair of pants from the same material to go with each suit.
The price of the suit and extra pair of pants is only $5.00.

drink all fermented beverages, such as
wine, beer or cider. The fees for ad

strike of livery drivers, which has last
ed for ten days. Their carriages and
hearses driven by non-union men were
used at funerals, and but little QJsorder
resulted. The funerals which were com
pelled to pass through the business sec
tion of the city were frequently blocked
by teamsters and street car men, who
placed their vehicles in the way. The
police In every instance straightened
out the blockades immediately. One
teamster who intentionally scraped a
hearse with his heavy truck was pulled
from his seat and arrested.
The livery owners decided to-day to
make a fight for the "open shop," and
issued a warning to the strikers that
all men who wished to secure their old
places must return by Monday morn-
Ing or, their places would be filled by
other men. After Monday all the sta
bles will be "open" and will be conduct
ed on that basis hereafter.

Colorado Strikers Complain Because
1 Troops Are Sent to Mining Districts.
DENVER, Dec. 26.â The Colorado
State Federation of Labor to-day Is
sued a circular, which is being sent
to every labor union in the State. A
protest is made against the action of
Governor Peabody in sending the
State troops into the mining districts
where strikes are in progress and in
denying the writ of habeas corpus,
placing a censorship on the pres3 and
denying the right of citizens to keep
firearms in their- homes. These things
are done. It is declared, for the pur
pose of defeating the eight-hour
movement and disrupting the labor
unions. Laboring men are urged to
Join an organization known as the
"Law and Order and. Constitutional
Rights Protective League."' The cir
cular closes with these words:
"As freemen we would live; in its
defense we should be ready to die."

CHICAGO, Dec. 26.â Threats of an
other strike on the line of the Chicago
City Railway Company have been made
by the business agents of the organiza

new agreements with the traction com
pany. They have formally notified Gen
eral Manager McCulloch of the com
pany that, unless he concede their de
mands by January 1, the stationary
firemen, steam engineers, electricians
and teamsters employed by the com
pany would be ordered to quit work. It
also was announced that, when the
classes of workmen named were called
out, an appeal for sympathetic strike
action would be made to the street car
men.
The demands of the business agents,
which were practically an ultimatum,
were ignored by McCulloch, who de
clared that he could not even decide the
question of signing new agreements
with the unions' representatives.

The Peking correspondent of the
London Times asserts that Russia has
no such force at Port Arthur as Ad
miral Alexieff would like the world to
believe. At the revjew there last
month it was said that 76,000' troops
passed before the commander. The
Times man asserts that the review was
held within a race course which is one
and a quarter miles in circumference.
Admiral AlexiefC informed the foreign
ers there that they were looking at
100,000 troops. This was so absurd
that the official reports made the num
ber 76,000. As a matter of fact, the
true number was 21,000. The total
number of Russian trbops of all arms
in. leased territory is 32,000, which is
being increased 'to 50,000. '* ;* "

Croesus, the John D. Rockefeller
of the kingdom of Lydia, was very
well-to-do in worldly goods and chat-
tels. "As rich as Croesus" is a saying
about 2500 years old. He had his trou-
bles, however, and some of them were
full grown. He was taken captive once
by Cyrus and only saved himself from
being burned alive by quoting a saying
of Solon the sage. He finally had to
flee his kingdom for parts unknown.
Many of the rich man's troubles to-
day come from high living and could
be avoided. They are brought on by
eating all kinds of rich, heavy foods
at irregular times, lack of proper ex-
ercise, undue mental strain, unnatural
stimulants, etc., and are commonly
known as indigestion, dyspepsia and
weak stomach. They are serious trou-
bles all right/but not only can they
be avoided, but can also be cured, and
that without loss of time or proper food
and nourishment.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
certain relief of dyspeptics, rich and
poor alike. There is no such thing as
stopping their onward progress now.
A great nation has placed Its stamp of
approval upon their noble work. The
thousands and thousands of cures they
have effected and the happiness result-
ing therefrom have made their name a
household word throughout the land.
The story of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets can be told in a word. They
actually do the work that the weak
and wasted stomach is unable to do
and allow, It to recuperate and regain
its strength. They contain all the es-
sential properties that' the gastric juice
and other digestive fluids do, and they
digest the food just as a sound and well
stomach would. They relieve the stom-
ach just as one res*ted and refreshed
workman 1 relieves the one on dutythat
Is tired and worn, and Nature does her
own work of restoration. It Is a simple,

pepsia Tablets are for sale by all drug-
gists at 50 cents a box. Druggists all
know better than to try. to get along

The nm of the former Premiers
death, although expected, produced a
profound impression here. Rome con- j
sidered him as one of her citizens. The
Kin? and Queen learned of the death
of Signor ZanardeKi while they were I
attending the opening night of the op- j
rra season and immediately left the j
theater. Premier Goletti to-nigbt gave j
the news of the death of Signor Zanar
delli to the Cabinet Ministers.
ROME. Dec. 26.â Former Premier
Zanardelli died at 7:30 o'clock to-night
at his villa in Maderno, on Lake Carda.
During his fatal illness he was nursed
by ;to sisters* and by the ijari^.i priest,
v.ho, at tUa expressed desire of the for
mer Premier, was admitted to the tick
ioo:n et all hours. Signor Zanardelli
v.-;:s conscious of the fact that' death
was Inevitable -and a few days age,

In 1SS4, on the fall of the Giolitti Min
istry, he tried to form a Cabinet, but
had to give place to Signor Crispl,
whose bitter and factious enemies he
then joined. The hostility caused him
to be beaten in a provincial election In
Brescia, his own home, in May, 18'J5.
The general election immediately en
sued. After the general election, of
March, 1S97, the Marquis di Rudiiii
mainly relied for support in Parliament
on the combined parties of Giolitti and
Zanardelli.
became Minister of Public Works in
the first Depretis Cabinet, which port
folio he resigned in November, 1877, in
consequence of differences with De
pretis, which made it impossible for
him to eign, as Minister of Public
Works, the railway convention ar
ranged by the latter. He was appoint
ed to the Home Office in the CairoH
Ministry in March, 1878, and went into
the opposition on its fall. He was Min
ister of Justice and Cults under the va
rious Crispi Ministers, and the new
Italian Penal Code, which came into
force on January 1, 1890, was chiefly
due to him.

GLOOM CAST OVER HOME
BY THE DEATH OF ONE
OF HER STATESMEN*.
Persons in the building heard the
noise of a falling body, but the cause
was not discovered until several hours
later, when the woman was found dead
in the areaway. Her skull was crushed
and there were many marks upon the
body, evidently not caused by a fall
from the window of her flat. Four
lodgers have been detained by the po
lice, but all declare Mrs. Reimer w^p
absent when they went to bed, and be
lieve she either committed suicide or
fell from the roof while hunting her pet
cat.
The woman's life has been somewhat
of a mystery. She is known to have
had a comfortable income, but she
never disclosed its source and had little
in common with her neighbors.
NEW YORK, Dec. 26.â A close inves

of Mrs. Mary Reimer, a widow, 45 years

thousand dollars on deposit In the
banks, and carried about with her a
bag filled with jewelry. Xo trace of the
bank books or valuables can be found.

Judge Mogan received a special
message yesterday morning from a
bunch of canvasback ducks, who had
just arrived from the mouth of the
Colorado River. They told him they
were waiting for him in the marshes
around Redwood City. Accordingly
* â¢ *
The trusting sureties who signed a
bond in the sum of $1000 for the ap
pearance of Frank Curran on a burg
lary charge will have to produce the
coin. Curran failed to appear before
Judge Fritz yesterday and his bond
was declared forfeited. Curran at
telnpted to replenish his stock of
shirts from a Chinese laundry south of
Market street. The watchful propri
etor caught him in the act and chased
him to the roof of the premises. When
a policeman arrived Curran was slid
ing down a wa^er pipe and fell an
easy victim for arrest. Curran is sup
posed to have left town, but if he still
haunts the peninsula legally known
as the city and county of San Fran
cisco he will still have to answer for
his invasion of the Chinese laundry,
despite the fact that his friends will
have to pay $1000 for his alleged
crime.
James B. Massle and S. B. Hamilton,
who were arrested on the complaint of
the United Brotherhood of Railway
Employes in connection with the se
curing of advertising for a souvenir
pamphlet, were dismissed by Judge
Cab'<rlss yesterday. There were two
charges against Massie, one of embez
zlement and one of forgery. The
charge against Hamilton was misde
meanor embezzlement. George Mon
teith, the attorney for the prosecution,
stated to the court that no demand
had ever been made on Massie for the
money claimed to be due from him.
Hamilton Had adjusted his financial
matter with the organization. Accord
ingly both were released from cus
tody. Clem B. Porter, business agent
for the order, gave formal testimony
to corroborate the statement "of the
attorney.

He went into Johnson's restaurant on
this mission Friday night and was told
to come around again. When he came
out a crowd of belligerent union wait
ers who 'have established a boycott
on the eating-house despitefully used
Small. They hit him on the nose and
the jaw and called him "scab." In
self-defense he backed up against the
building and drew a revolver to fright
en his assailants. Two police officers
arrested Small for exhibiting a deadly
weapon. Judge~Fritz adjudicated the
case yesterday and dismissed Small
without hesitation.
I. B. Small is of few days and full
of trouble. His wife ran away with
an ex-convict from their peaceful farm
in Oregon and he came to this city in
search of her. bringing with him three
children. He didn't find his erring
spouse, so he concluded to hunt a Job.
T. Itagina and V. Toko are two Jap
anese who were arrested on Dupont
street for disturbing the peace of the
neighborhood. Itagina was called up
on to furnish $5 bail, but his friend
needed 520 to secure his liberty. Both
were locked in the same cell at the
City Prison. Yoko was first to secure
the necessary funds for his liberty. He
told Itagina that the only way to lib
erty lay in giving him an order for
$19 on a restaurant where Itagina
worked. When Yoko secured the or
der he got the money, but let his friend
languish in jail, while he spent the
fund in wild revelry. Before Judge
Conlan he was convicted of misde
meanor embezzlement and on Monday
will be given fit punishment for his
breach of friendship. Â¦

To Judge Fritz yesterday fell the
duty of dispensing Justice to the
Christmas drunks. There were^ eighty
three of them lined up in the City
Prison. Such a multitude necessitated
making two rows of them. The Judge
entered on his duty cheerfully and
with a spirit of mercy that falleth like
the gentle dew from heaven.
'â¢The warmest of holiday greetings
to all of you," he said. Then his eye
c.iught sight of an old offender. "Why,
how are you, Cardigan?" he asked. "I
thought you promised to cut out the
booze for three months." Cardigan
shuffled uneasily. "It was Christmas,
Tanner, and I couldn't help taking a
few drinks." "All right, Cardigan,"
said the Judge, "but you had better
overlook New Year as a celebrating
period."
Then the Judge backed up against
the desk and said to the desk ser
geant, "There is a fine- bunch. What
shall I do with them?" Sergeant Mel
ody suggested dismissal. "All right,"
said the Judge, "you may all go, but
be sure not to come before me again,
or I will have to take measures to.in
sure your future sobriety." The motly
crowd, men and women, packed the
elevators in its desire to escape fur
ther custody. Judge Fritz watched the
departure in a dignified manner,
winked craftily at the turnkey and
followed the mob downstairs. When
he reached the courtroom he smiled.
"When Cardigan come3 up again," he
said, "there is going to be something
doing for him."

All the Implements of Justice, in
cluding the official dignity of the
court, were removed yesterday by
Judge Fritz to 42 Turk street, where
Eugene Constantine lies in a furnished
room with a bullet hole in his leg.
The Judge wanted to hear the wound
ed man's version of the affray â¢ in
which he was so sorely wounded.
Some days ago Paul E. Barlow, for
merly a resident of Chicago and late
ly a visitor to San Francisco, was
aroused from his slumbers in a lodg
ing-house at 36 Stockton street by
the screams of a woman in distress,
/in a large spirit of chivalry he invad
ed an adjoining room occupied by
Constantine and Ella Woods, a noto
rious character. Constantine was en
gaged in the pleasing occupation of
beating the woman. Barlow request
ed him to cease and threatened him
with a revolver. The first shot went
through the floor and the \ second
struck the woman beater in the leg.
Barlow has been in custody ever
since on the charge of attempted mur
der. Constantlne's story did nothing
to strengthen the charge' And 7l may
be that Judge Fritz will allow the
chivalrous gentleman his liberty on
preliminary examination.
he closed .shop yesterday and went
looking for the ducks. Judge Caban
iss tended to affairs during Judge Mo
gan's absence. The case of W. F. At
kins, who made a finish for Muldoon
McDonald, the colored pugilist, by
shooting him through the heart on
Christmas day, was the only one of
importance to be heard. Atkins was
instructed as to his rights in. the mat

will have his preliminary hearing on

Cox's reckless and sensational per
formance occurred this morning short
ly after 1 o'clock, while the last local
train on the north side lino was pull
ing out from Park-street station pre
paratory to rounding the Fruitvale
"horn" and going to East Oakland to
lay up for the night.
Cox had started to walk to Fruitvale
by way of the railroad, and when near
Everett street and Railroad avenue felt
that he was to_ tired and weary to
continue the journey on foot, and con
ceived the risky plan of making a flag
out of himself and bringing the train
to a standstill so that he could get on
board. After the train was stopped
the crew dragged the intoxicated youth
from the tra # ck, notified the police sta
tion, and Cox was soon resting in a
ceU. This morning he appeared before
City Justice R. B. Tappan, pleaded
guilty and wa3 lectured by the court,
who said:
ALAMEDA, Dec. 26.â Failing to stop
an oncoming train by waving his hands
at the locomotive, John Cox, an in
toxicated youth, deliberately lay down
across the rails, and when the train
was brought to a sudden stop the ten
der of the engine was but a few feet
from the form of the inebriated young
man.

Our tremendous wssortment has been very much broken, but there Is still an immense variety of fine new up-
rlrht and Baby Grand Pianos to select from on our retail floors at 653 Market street
Last year we sold an enormous number of fine pianos and organs during December, but we'll sell half again as
mac Â£ b fl or t ? Â« Deccn * b . e '" closes. The reason is plain. It has become thoroughly known ' that Pommer-Eilers
handle the best pianos obtainable and sell them for a great deal less than is asked for the same grades elsewhere.
Jsevr facilities in shipping and handling large numbers of pianos, low rents and storage expenses, and many
other saving facilities^ enable Pommer-Eilers to save a retail buyer a clean hundred dollars or more on each piano.
This is no idle talk, but fact, as has been demonstrated to nearly 6000 buyers who have patronized us during the past
twenty-two months. .'--- .- .-.->,

ed victim.
George Ortlip, a clerk in a grocery
at 796 Bush street, accidentally received
a painful gunshot wound in the face
yesterday morning while he was toy
ing with a revolver belonging to Ed
ward Collins, another clerk in the store.
There are three clerks in the store â
Ortlip, Collins and Gordon Chapman.
Collins and Chapman had agreed to
go hunting on Sunday morning and
Collins took his revolver from his
home to the store. He took the weapon
out of his pocket and extracted, as he
thought, the five cartridges, but
through a defect in the mechanism a
cartridge was left.
Collins asked Ortlip what he thought
of his revolver, and Ortlip took it from
him and began snapping the trigger, till
a bullet struck him on the right side
of the nose and lodged in the socket
of the right eye.
â¢The report of the shot caused the
wildest excitement in the locality and
police headquarters was notified. De
tective Bell was detailed on the case
and he had Ortlip removed to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital, where the
bullet was extracted. Bell made an
investigation and was satisfied that the
shooting was accidental.

IX MARIX COUNTY.
The firm doing business under the
name of Sprouts' Market, at 1049 Mar
ket street, has failed for a sum aggre
gating 520,000, and the plac.e, which ,has
closed its doors, is now in the Sheriff's
hands. Edward S. Sproat is proprietor
of the concern and with him is asso
ciated a brother in its' management.
Back of the failure lies a story of dis
honored checks.
Keifer, Howard & Co., who were the
first to attach Sproats' Market, were
given a check for $480 signed by S.
Sproat last Thursday evening after
banking hours in part payment for a
lot of turkeys sold during the holiday
season to the Sproats. This morning
when a representative of the Keifer
Cojnpany presented himself at the bank
with the check he was informed that
there was no money to the credit of
the Sproats. The Keifer Company
thereupon became suspicious and im
mediately levied an attachment on the
concern for J761 11, for which suit was
brought by J. J. Dolan as "assignee.
Other creditors were quick to follow
and an attachment for $134 18 was lev
ied by D. A. Curtin and another for
5270 by Rauer's Collection Agency for
moneys advanced. Later in the day
writs were levied at the instance of
the A. L. Lundy Company for $199 97
and L. Jacobi for $7S1 49. Cluff Bros,
are creditors to the extent of $3200.
A number of labor claims aggregat
ing several hundred dollars were also
filed against the firm, being for wages
of the employes who were discharged
early |*esterday morning. It is said
that the Western National Bank ad
vanced the firm $1000 and will take
steps to secure repayment of the
money. Although the liabilities will
reach $20,000, there is said to be but'
$5000 worth of stock in the place. The
Sproats say that a settlement will be
effected on Monday. The Board of
Trade has taken the matter up and
creditors for large amounts will meet
to take action.

S.VLES OF A WEEK.
"The essence of all this is that San
Francisco is seen by the outsider of
intelligence to be a good place for in
vestment. That is now evident to all
observers."
"The southwest corner of Sacra
mento and Fillmore streets has been
pold to a gentleman from the East.
The property of the estate of Ludwig
Altschul on the south line of Sutter
street, 147 feeet west of Devisadero,
has been sold to a gentleman from
Australia. In the Crossley building,
in which the offices are rapidly filling
up, there were an unusually large
number of rooms rented last week.
One important and remarkable fea
ture of this is that over 90 per cent
of the offices rented during the last
ten days have been to people who
have never been in San Francisco be
fore and are opening up business in
various lines here, or for agencies
and other trade lines which have
never been represented in San Fran
cisco.
The great real estate deal of* the
last week of December. 1903, in this
city was the Rale of the Bishop prop
erty, formerly known as the Cunning
ham property, on Market street, be
tween the Palace Hotel and the Hearst
building, for $1,000,000. Full partic
ulars of tliis transaction were pub
lished in The Call yesterday. The sell
er is Mrs. Mary Cunningham Bishop
and the buyer is<!Ierbert E. Law. The
brokers through whom the business
was transacted are Thomas Magee &
Sons for Mr. Law and Shainwald.
Buckbee & Co. for Mrs. Bishop. This
addition of $1,000,000 to the sales of
the year goes practically toward mak
ing a new record for 1903, although,
in fact, the Bishop sale will be credit
ed to the year 1904, as the period of
possibly sixty days will elapse before
the deed becomes of record.
The last week, although not char
acterized by a large number of an
nouncements of sales, has been filled
with signs of promise for the coming
year. One firm of brokers is known
to have sold 550,000 worth of realty
in several parcels in one day, but the
particulars are not yet ready for pub
lication. The following statements
made by Shainwald, Buckbee & Co.
point out a dominant feature of the
present situation:
A tract in block 29, on the corner
of Brazil avenue and Lisbon street has
been sold by C. B. Fernald to Sol. Getz
& Son, who intend to divide the prop
erty into building lots. Two years ago
this district was used by dairymen, but
the stock limit having been extended
to the county line the dairies have
been removed find the lots are now to
be sold on reasonable terms. Already
upward of 300 homes have been erect
ed ther~. Getz & Son report that as
Mission street has been bituminized
the Excelsior homestead is in a fair
way of becoming rapidly settled.
The price for which the southwest
corner of Sacramento and Fillmore
streets was sold is about 532,500. The
lot is 79:6 on Fillmore street and 103:6
feet on Sacramento street. On it are
two buildings, of which a branch post
office is one. The deal was made
through the agency of Shainwald,
Buckbee & Co. The same brokers have
sold:

erty on the south line of Putter street,. 147 feet

Three months from the time he had

received a carpenter shop. Through

There Is red tape in the methods of
the American War Department, but a
recent instance in the British army
eclipses all records on this side of the
water.
An officer had occasion to use a screw
driver, and made formal application for
the implement. The request was read,
approved, indorsed, by one officer after
another, until it reached the topmost
seat of authority. There the applica
tion was solemnly considered and start
ed back on its downward path through
the various official channels, until it
reached the audacious officer who had
made the request and forgotten about
it in the intervening weeks.
He was informed that screwdrivers
were supplied only in boxes of tools,
and not singly. He was not daunted,
but with admirable persistence filled
out nother form requerting the box
of tools in order that he might obtain
the screwdriver. After the same
weary round of delay and formality
this application came back. Its in
dorsement stated that boxes of tools
were only supplied to carpenter shops.
The patient officer set himself down
again to : fill out a blank application.
This time he asked for a carpenter
shop, and a month later received
word that a duly equipped and ap
pointed carpenter shop would be
supplied him.

"VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 26.â Not
content with stealing money and jew

pert housebreakers last night got
drunk on wine in the residence of
Charles Inkster, on EveleJgh street,
and and then caused wholesale damnge
to thd interior of the house.
The Inkster family had gone out. to
dinner and the burglars were probably
in the house two hours. First they
made a thorough search, taking the
money and jewelry. Then they discov
ered wine in the cellar and prepared a
repast of cold turkey and delicacies.
When this had been disposed of tho
men got an ax from the woodshed
and proceeded to break things. The
parlor furniture was demolished and
piled up in a heap. Mirrors, paintings
and panels were smashed and slashed.
The men then used the ax on a i-ase
of cut glassware. Trunks vwere
smashed, dresses were ripped and fooi
boards were knocked out of the beds.

Field S. Pendleton, .president of iho
Atlantic Carriers' Association, who is
also at the head of the federation,
said to-day that, because of differences
between members of the Atlantic
Coast Seamen's Union and employers in
the shipping Industry, a federation had
been formed to establish friendly rela
tions between employers and seamen.
"The members of the federation,
whether employers or employes, will
co-operate to advance the interests of
their membership," he said. "We wish
to do away with annoyances from
which the masters have been suffering
for years. We do not wish to be de
layed when our ships are about to sail,
but we do not desire to fight the union.
We desire to give competent men a
chance for promotion and we do not
want Incompetent men placed in posi
tions which they are not fitted to fill."
Otto S. von Peterson is manager of
the American Seamen's Federation.
Pickets of the Atlantic Coast Sea
men's Union have been watching the
offices at 2 'State street, the headquar
ters of the federation. Assistant Man
ager John Brown of the federation said
to-day:
"Members cf the Atlantic Coast Sea
men's Union have been following
crews hired for the federation to ships,
but did not get a chance to interfere
with the men. We engaged nine crews
during the last two days, and many
men are now joining the federation.
We have told the men that we are not
opposing the union. The union so far
has not succeeded In getting any of our
members to leave the federation. Once
this week it looked as if we would
have a serious fight with union men,
but the latter went away without re
sorting to violence."
NEW YORK. Dec. 26.â Ship owners,
masters and seamen have formed a
federation for purposes of nautical co
operation and to oppose the tactics of
the International and Atlantic Coast
Seamen's unions. This federation is
now rapidly growing and a large num
ber of masters, mates and seamen em
ployed on sailing vessels along the At
lantic coast have joined. The employ
ers connected with the federation have
agreed not to discriminate against
union men. The American Seamen's
Federation is the name of the new or

WRECK MADE OF MIRRORS
Tho cause of three-fourths of the
shipwrecks and loss of life at sea
seems about to be removed. It is not
a wire, or even the air, but the water
this time that is used to transmit
sound \i';:^tions. For some weeks there
has been installed on the steamers of
the Metropolitan Company of Boston
an apparatus which may yet make it
possible for the vessel } ating about
the coast ir. a Etorm I- know where
the rocks and sho 'Â¦Â» are \ ?n the fog
will not permit the ligr . to be seen and
the noise of the wind "-owns the sound
of the bell buoy or the sire*- for a bat
tleship to know of the approach of a
subrrr.r^ne*and a fishing sm:. k of the
approach of a liner off ihe banks of
Newfoundland.
The apparatus is extremely simple.
It amounts to nothing more or- less
than ringing a bell under water which
the pilot or Cjiptain can hear telephon
ically. Screwed on both sides of the
vessel's hull are two receivers, which
are connected by wires with the wheel
house. These receive the vibrations
from the bell hanging in the water on
the side of the lightship. The navi
gator has only to put the earpiece to
his ear and ascertain on which side
the vibrations are the louder, in order
to know the direction of the light
house and his own position in the fog
with comparative accuracy. For fish
ing vessels a bell receiver has be*n
provided^, and this is used also to get
more delicate intonations ab'oard a
steel vessel. The value of the appa
ratus was put to a good test recently,
when the steamer James S. Whitney
was approaching the Boston lightship
on her return from New York. The
lighthouse was obscured by rain and
fog. Thinks to the signal apparatus,
th captain immediately heard the bell
and got his direction. It was not until
five minutes after that he heard" the
lightship's whistle for the first time. â

ter what you may acquire in a univer
sity. No one knows how a journalist is
made, and no one knows how to make
one. A machine that will turn out a
journalist and give him a degree to
that effect may do a good b.usiness in
degrees and may equip some young
men to write after a fashionâ without
inspiration â folios of sorrow. A great
newspaper is a strange, live and unex
pected thing that rushes into existence
through the night, made by many
hands, swayed by many circumstances
and born in the rush and delirium of
10,000 thrilling currents racing to their
goal from the brain centers of the
world. A strange untutored youth
standing in the doorway sees something
spring out of the confusion, grasps it
and is gone. To him it is a thing to sell
in a hurry. To you and me, who have
watched its birth, it is like the finished
model in the sculptor's studio sur
rounded by the waste and wreck of
scaffolding and clay, standing alone in
Its simple magnificence, the marvelous
offspring of science and art â a modern
newspaper. To know this thing, to un
derstand how it grows, upon what it
feeds, what sustains it and what it
means, you must have lived with it;

The official mind in Prussia seems?
<o be gradually coming to the recogni
tion that the policy pursued hitherto
with regard to the Germanization of
the Polish provinces has been as
futile as it is costly. What happens in
Polish Silesia is somewhat
as follows: With* the liberal sums re
ceived from the Prussian Government
as the price of their estates, the Polish
proprietors liquidate their debts and
devote the balance to founding bank
ing establishments In the towns. In
Â¦which they carry on a lucrative busi
ness by advancing money at reasonable
rates of interest to the tradesmen and
artisans, who. In turn, have laid out
the loans so advantageously that a
large and comparatively prosperous
middle class has been created, who
have actually been economically strong

PUZZLE WORKERSThe United States treasury holds
three and nine-tenths as much gold as
the Bank of England.
Of the different methods tested in this
series of experiments the old way of
using slacked lime and salt brine proved
to be very effectual and has the advan
tage of being inexpensive. It is also not
difficult to practice. For a period of a
few weeks only, smearing with vaseline
may prove an effectual method of preser
vation. In the place of vaseline almost
any clean, greasy substance may be
used. For a period of a few months only,
packing ln dry table salt is worthy of
recommendation. Of all the substances
experimented with, the water glass solu
tion proved most worthy of commenda
tion. The experiments showed that the
water glass solution could be reduced to
3 per cent and still retain its preserving
qualities. "It can be obtained at most
druggists at from 40 to 60 cents per gal
lon, is easily manipulated, and the solu
tion may bo repeatedly used. . The eggs
should be completely immersed in the
solution, and if any eggs float an inner
cover which will sink . them below the
surface of the liquid should be used. In
several tests where the eggs' were placed
in 6tono jars inverted saucers were used
foi* this purpose. The expense for tho
water glass at even CO cents per gallon
would amount to about two-thirds of a
cent for a dozen eggs. Of course this
does not include the expense of the stone
jar or other receptacle, which may be of
stoneware, glass or even wood. â Rhode

The flrst crop of service in the spring
is rye, which is sometimes ready for
feeding the last week in April and may
be continued through the flrst half of
May. It matures very rapidly after the
heads appear, and may be successfully
used for a period of fronvten to fourteen
(days if seeded at different times, and
cutting is begun before it comes in head.
Where it is not practicable to practice
soiling, the crops may be pastured. This
'method, while more wasteful, is less ex
pensive than soiling. It is very impor
tant to have a pasture crop at that sea
son, because coming before meadow pas
tures are ready. . Â¦
The crop yields well*on medium soils,
though* it responds profitably to good
treatment. It Is recommended that it be
seeded thicker than where the crop is
used for grain. From two to two and a
half bushels of seed may be used with
'advantage on good soils. Â¦ \ Â»
The fertilizers should be rich in avail
able phosphoric acid. A fertilizer con
taining nitrogen 3 per cent, phosphoric
acid 8 per cent and potash 5 per cent
may be applied at the time of seeding at
the rate of 200 to 300 pounds per acre.
A top dressing of nitrate of soda In the
spring at the rate of 100 to 150 pounds
per acre is excellent.- â New York Farmer.

Tries to Drown Herself in Ocean.
A woman tried to commit suicide

Those in charge of the resort refused

The Angora fleece runs from two and
a half up as high as ten pounds, though
the average fleece of the average flock is
about three and a quarter pounds. Amer
ican mohair has sold this year and last
from 30 to 40 per cent higher than Turk
ish and South African mohair has sold
for in the great English markets of
Bradford, which formerly made the
prices for the world's mohair product.
It is one of the most 'valuable facts
that the Angora provides the only milk
and flesh mankind uses that is not sub
ject to some disease, says an exchange.
Also that the Angora goat fraternizes
with sheep and cattle. It is a fact, too,
that Angoras remove brush and weeds,
fertilze the soil, which valuable service
makes the wealth producing sheep, and
where goats herd and graze with live
stock their health is maintained. In con
clusion, then, it is a fact that whoever
wishes to make Angora goat keeping
more profitable should kindly care for
and generously feed the flock. These in
sure more and better -fleece and meat and
flock. And as it costs but half as much
time and feed to fatten old Angoras as it
does sheep, and they produce better pro
ducts at old age than any of our domes
tic animals, it is a fact worth heeding.

.Should Roosevelt demand an lnvesl
gation into the nefarious work of un
dertakers of San Francisco, the com
mittee promises to make disclosures
that will create a scandal such as has
not been known in Government circles
in this city before.
The Government provides a good
casket for each dead soldier. The un
dertakers by changing this casket for
a redwood box are able to sell the
casket, making in the neighborhood
of $30.
John J. Hay den, under whose super
vision the body of the late Sergeant
William Fogarty was interred, swore
to an affidavit yesterday to the effect
that he had received the body of the
dead soldier and turned It over to Hugh
B. McAvoy for burial. Hayden also
states in the affidavit that McAvoy sub
stituted an ordinary cheap redwood
box for the casket supplied by * the
Government. He further says that the
body was interred at the . Holy Cross
Cemetery on February 6, 1900. Hay
den turned over his affidavit to the
committee of Camp Reinhold RIchter
of the Spanish War Veterans, who
have already notified President Roose
velt of the practice of "swapping" good
Government caskets for cheap wooden
boxes by certain undertakers of this
city.

"The first few streams from each teat
should be thrown away, because the teat
at its mouth is filled with milk which,
being exposed to the air, is full of germs
and will do much toward souring the
other milk in the pail. Barely a gill will
be lost by throwing the first drawings
away, and this of the poorest milk, too.
The increase in the keeping quality of
the milk w... much more than repay the
email loss. If these precautions are
taken the milk will keep several hours
or even days longer than milk carelessly
handled. . By taking these steps to pre
vent germs from falling into the milk, a
can of milk was once kept sweet for
thirty-one days.
"The work of the germ in the dairy is
not. however, confined to souring the
milk. It is the germ that gives to the
different kinds of cheeses their charac
teristic flavors and to butter its flavor.
If the right germ is present cheese or
butter gets a proper flavor. Sometimes
undesirable germs gain entrance and
give flavors that we do not like. Such
germs produce cheese or butter diseases.
'Bitter butter' is one of these diseases.
To keep out all unpleasant meddlers,
thoroughly cleanse and scald every uten
sil." â Agriculture for Beginners.
"To avoid further germs the milker
should wear clean overalls, should have
clean hands, and above all should never
wet his hands with milk. This last
habit, in addition to being filthy, lessens
the keeping power of the milk. The
milker should also moisten the parts of
the cow nearest him, so that dust from
the cow's sides may not fall Into the
milker's pail. For greater cleanliness
and safety many milkmen curry their
cows.
"Milk sours because bacteria from the
air fall Into the milk, begin to grow, and
very shortly change the sugar of the
milk to an acid. When this acid becomes
abundant the milk begins to curdle. The
bacteria are^n the air, in water, in barn
dust; they stick on bits of hay and to the
cow. They are most plentiful, however,
in milk that has soured; hence, if we
pour a little sour milk "into a pail of
fresh milk, the fresh milk will sour very
quickly, because we have, so to speak,
'seeded' or 'planted' the fresh milk with
the souring germs. No one, of course,
ever does this purposely ln the dairy,
vet people sometimes do what amounts
to the same thing â that is, put fresh
milk into poorly cleaned pails or pans,
the cracks and corners of which are cosy
homes for millions of germs left from
the last sour milk contained ln the ves
sel. It follows, then, that all utensils
used in the dairy should be thoroughly
scalded so as to kill all germs present,
and particular care should be taken to
clean the cracks and crevices, for in
them the germs lurk.
"In addition to this thorough cleans
ing with hot water, we should be careful
never to stir up the dust of the barn Just
before milking. Such dusty work as
pitching hay or stover or arranging bed
ding should be done either long before
or after milking time, for more germs
fall into the milk if the air be full of
dust.

Treating Lumpy Jam.
In a treatise on lumpy jaw, recently
issued by the Indiana experiment station,
the disease Is diagnosed and treatment
prescribed as follows:
"This- disease more often affects cattle
than other animals. It is due to a fun
eu~s or actinomycosls. The fungus oc
curs upon grass or other vegetation and
it is only when it becomes introduced
into the tissues that It causes trouble.
The disease comes from eating and out
side sources and is not contagious ln the
usual sense of the word. Several ani
mals may become affected while on the
same pasture, but this is not due to all
being exposed alike. Some years the
number of cases is greater than others^
owing to the greater development of this
fungus. The disease affects the jaw
more often than other parts, due to the
fact that the tissues are sometimes bro
ken In the act of chewing, and thus per
mitting infection. Any part of the body
may be attacked.
"The disease is comparatively easy to
treat. A dram of iodide of potash Is
given twice a day, from two weeks to
twenty days. For cattle weighing 1200
pounds or more the dose is somewhat In
creased, and lessened for calves. If pus
be present in the lump it should be let
out by incision. In a few refractory
cases a second period of treatment may
be required after resting: for ten days.
About 80 per cent of recoveries may be
expected. Affected animals should b*
kept away from the healthy, and off the
pasture fields. In case of milch cows
the milk should not be used. The State
does not pay for such animals when It is
found necessary to destroy them."

WASHINGTON. Dec. Â£6.â Five hun
dred children, youthful sons and daugh
| ters of members of the Cabinet, Sena-
I tors, Representatfves, army and navy
j officers, members of the Diplomatic
| Corps, assistant secretaries of depart
ments and Washington newspaper cor
respondents, were the guests, between
4 and 6 o'clock, of Mrs. Roosevelt at
the White House. The reception began
at 4 o'clock, Mrs. Roosevelt being as
sisted by the ladies of the Cabinet and
Miss Hapner.
The White House had been decorated
beautifully for this Christmas party.
Great palms and Christmas greens
adorned the reception hall and parlors,
the green being enlivened here and
there with splashes of the flaming red
of poinsettia blossoms and American
Beauty roses. The scene was rendered
brilliant by hundreds of electric lights.
The children were formed in line near
the staircase. Thence they marched up
the staircase to the entrance of the
green room, where they were received
by their hostess quite as if they were
grown up. Each child was introduced
to Mrs. Roosevelt by Major Charles Mc-
Cawley of the Marine Corps, and by her
was given a cordial greeting. Each
was then presented with a programme
and a souvenir of the party in the form
! of a badge-favor bearing Mrs. Roose
! velfs compliments and good wishes for
, the season. The little guests were con
| ducted through the green room to the
! east room by officers of the army, navy
and marine corps in full uniform and
there seated.
The entertainment began with a mu
sical programme rendered by "Roney's
Boys" Concert Company of Chicago.
This part of the programme consumed
! nearly an hour, the children being en
thusiastic ln their commendation.
Just before the first number on the
musical programme was rendered
President Roosevelt entered the room,
taking an inconspicuous seat near the
green room entrance. He entered thor
oughly into the spirit of the occasion
and enjoyed every minute of the enter
tainment. The idea of the party, how
ever, was wholly that of Mrs. Roose
velt, and she worked out all the details.
Scores of the children were afforded an
opportunity to greet the President and
to wish him "a happy new year."
At the conclusion of the concert the
youthful guests were escorted to the
state dining-room to the music of the
Marine Band, -which was stationed in
the reception hall. The dining-room
was handsomely decorated. On a table
at the north end was a beautiful Christ
mas tree loaded with favors and lighted
by scores of parti-colored electric lights.
The great dining-room was decorated
with poinsettia blossoms and holly and
lighted by silver candelabra capped
with red shades. It was heaped with
all such Christâ'-- goodies as appeal
particularly to the heart of a child. The
icecream was molded into the form of
Santa Claus, and pretty favors were
provided for each guest.
After the refreshments had been
served the young people returned to the
east room. The older among them
danced to the music of the Marine
Band, while the younger ones played
games in the parlors. The attentions
shown the children by Mrs. Roosevelt
and her assistants and by the numer
ous attendants were so delicate and
graceful that the joy of not a single
one was marred and all left the White
House praising their thoughtful and
considerate hostess.

strength' is rapidly returning. The catarrh of the nose and throat is gone. I do
not hawk up the sickening mucus like I did before. The membrane in my nose is
stronger. I do not feel like sneezing all the time, and It seems almost incredible
to me that in one month's time, at such a little expense, that such curative re-
r suits are possible. I da not seek cheap newspaper notoriety, but I really feel
that sufferers should know of the remarkable success of the Electro-Chemlo

TIIK VALUE OF CHARCOAL..
Tow PcojjJp -Knoiv JIow Useful It Is I
in JÂ»reÂ«eri ing. Health and Beauty.
Nearly everj'body knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient dis-
infectant and purifier in nature, but few
realize its value tvhen taken into the
human system for the same cleansing
purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more
you take cZ It the better; It is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
rapes and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
th<;m out of the pystem.
Charcoal Fweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the I
' teeth and further acts as a natural and J
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
cllyinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
Js in Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
TTIIlow charcoal and other harmless an-
tiseptics ln tablet form or rather in the
form of large, pleasant tasting lozen-
pes, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use. but. on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
thÂ« benefits of charcoal says: "I advise
Btuart's Absorbent Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering from gas in stomach
end bowels and to clear the complexion
and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is greatly
beneHted by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I get
fc.7iore and better charcoal in Stuart's
Absorbent Lozenges than In any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

The Brooklyn Eagle gives a very in
teresting account of a geological change
caught in the making. It' says:
"The sea of Azov, a body of water a
hundred miles or so in diameter, that,
opens from the Black' Sea into the Cos
sack country, is reported to be disap
pearing, like Salt Lake. Ships are
stranded at Taganrog, and the exposed j
bottom, drying in the sun. converts the Â¦
dust which is whirled in suffocating
clouds ever wide reaches of territory.
Although in the latitude of Middle
France. New. Brunswick and Lake Su
perior, the sea, which Is nearly inclosed. !
is usually frozen over frc-m this time
till March, and it may bÂ£ that the
heaping of ice blocks on the bars has
dammed the water away from' some of
the ports. This would be no more re-
Azov Sea Drying.
AMERICAN courts are continually passing upon
actions brought to prevent restraint of trade.
It is a question of necessity involved in the ap
plication of the anti-trust laws to great commercial
combinations and in the enforcement of the interstate
commerce law, which forbids rebates on transportation
charges. Heretofore the English decisions have been
taken as precedents, but now our courts are going be
yond them.
In the English case of the Mogul Steamship Com
pany vs. McGregor, which ;has been recently discussed
by the New York Journal of Commerce, Lord Cole
ridge decided that there was a distinction between le
gal and illegal restraint of trade. English ship owners
in the China trade combined and gave to tea shippers
a rebate of 5 per cent as an inducement to confine their
shipments entirely to the combine., Lord Coleridge
decided that this was legal, being merely an induce-

by-laws of a lodge require that a

In writing and laid over for a week, it
means that the proposition to make the

after lying over for one week, it

is subject to amendment at that tim-?,

RESTRAINT OF TRADE.
The fact thajt there exists among
manufacturing chemists, or, at any
rate, a section of them, a steady de
mand for snake venom, has long been
known to thf. scientific world, but the
purpose for which it is required has
not been rnadg public. Hitherto the
supply has been obtained chiefly from
Asia, but it has always been more or
less uncertain in quantity and charac
ter. Recently, however, Australia has
appeared as a competitor in the mark
et, but to what extent cannot be readi
ly ascertained, for snake venom, like
radium, is measured by grains, and
commands an almost fabulous price,
somewhere between Â£5D00 and Â£0000
per pound- It is doubtful whether the
world's annual production reaches that
quantity, but a value of from 20s to 25s
per grain will amply repay the col
lector. Possibly, \vith further develop
ments in medical science, the demand
will increase and lead to a correspond
ing rise in price, the supply" necessarily
remaining limited.
' Unique Traffic.
The Berlin Government has given expression to 'a
general opinion that if Japan decides to go to war
England' must fight with her, and Russia must be pre
pared to match her arms against both. It is also
quite evident that under these conditions England is in
the very interesting predicament of being afraid to
fight and Russia dare not. "

M. Gazet, a learned French Egyptol
ogist, has hit upon an idea which might
well make even archaeology popularâ
for a week or two. As the result of
long excavations and researches in
Egypt, he has succeeded In thoroughly
recovering from oblivion the! ritual
customs of ancient Egypt", and recently
in a lecture brought one phase of
Egyptian religionâ its sacred dances,
and. its magical incantations â vividly
before his public. Not relying alto
gether upon the spoken word, he had
trained Mile. Cerutti, a noted mimic
dancer of La Scala Theater, Milan, and
three other ladies, and these ladies,
clothed as priestesses of the Pharaohs!
reproduced in stately rhythmic tread
all the magic and mystery, the incan
tations and emotions of these dances,
forgotten for almost 3000 years.

Cal. There is no impropriety for a
domestic or emplora to give a Christ

taste, but if given by such prior to
having received something from the
mistress or employer it might be con
strued into "throwing a sprat to catch

Hjow we do blush for the brazenness
of our American curiosity hunters.
Some of them are without shame. For
example, the Government of Servia will
not let the American who wanted to
buy the furniture of King Alexander's
and Queen Draga's bed and wardrobe
rooms at the Belgrade Konak have
them. He offered successively 300.000
francs, 400,000 francs and went up to
500,000 francs. King Peter and his Min
isters think it would never do to let
them be taken over the States, and
then possibly over Europe, as a show.
This is the first time they have evinced
a sense of the shame attached to the
midnight enterprise-which raised Peter
to the throne and Maschin and the
Ministers to their present grand situa
tions. But as Queen Natalie inherits
all her son's fortune those who slaugh

EVERY large manufacturer and producer in the
country is anxiously awaiting the issue which is to
be joined in the present session of Congress over
the Lodge bill for the reform e>f the consular service.
During the Fifty-seventh Congress this act of the Mass
achusetts Senator progressed as far as a favorable re
port back to the Senate by the Committee on Foreign
Relations, but was there shelved by reason of the pre
cedence given to the measure for the creation of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor, and was effectively
kept in obscurity by jealous defenders of the spoils sys
tem of political preferment. ,\
It is evident that when the bill is reintroduced into the
Senate by Senator Lodge and the measure brought be
fore the House by Representative Burton of Ohio there
will be a pressure brought to bear of sufficient strength
to force an open fight upon the floors of Congress.
Through the activity of the National Business League,
a non-partisan organization of power in Chicago, a vig
orous campaign. in favor of the passage of this act has
been pressed until at present there are filed with the
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the
companion committee of the House indorsements of the
Lodge bill from commercial bodies and prominent
manufacturing concerns of all parts of the country.
The imperative need for a change in the consular sVs
tem is becoming more and more apparent with the in
creasing expansion of American trade interests abroad.
Senator Lodge's bill seeks, first and above all, to remove
the consular service from the field of political spoils and
establish it upon the basis of civil service with a tenure
of office which shall not be subject to the political ebb
and flow- at Washington. The second reform aimed at is
that of establishing, in place of the present fee system of
compensation for consuls, a fixed schedule of salaries,
graded according to a proposed improved classification
of our commercial agents abroad. Under the operation
of this innovation all prescribed fees collected for the
performance of duties by the consuls shall be strictly ac
counted for at the United States treasur}\
The most conspicuous feature of the Lodge. bill and
tly: one calculated to make for the most good is the pro
vision which- closes foreign cities as lumber rooms for
political props and scaffoldings. The gift of some cyno
sure in a favoring clime from the hands of a Congress
man fortunate in his election has long ceased to be a
new way to pay old debts. Our country has ample cause
for self-congratulation upon the efficiency of some of
these political^' endowed consulships in the past, but the
time has come when our foreign trade cannot be longer
entrusted to the uncertainties of chance and good luck.
Lodge's provision for a tenure of office during effi
ciency and the establishment of a fixed salary for consuls
is calculated to add much to the strength of the service.
Under the present system the man who is sent abroad
upon the unstable footing of political preferment has
'very little incentive to endeavor beyond the perfunctory
routine of. his office. He knows that any conscientious
system of investigation may be nipped in the bud by the
failure of election on the part ef Senator So-and-So.
There is no promotion to higher office and increased
.emolument. in view for him. He is merely living out the
gratitude of his patron. But in the hands of a consul
who has -merited his position by mental fitness' alone,
who has promotion before him to insure a continuous
and progressive life work, and whose bread and'butter
comes. not through the tortuous ways * fees and tips,

Brazzaville at this time was in a typi
cally French condition, with everything
at crosses. The administrator hated

cordially returned. Marchand had or

Kovrnmcnt had been to a half million
fxponse to get these two boats to Braz
zaville and was also maintaining the

iMUched the boat. They were always
rick. One really was sick and the others
were playing. During the day their
sole consolation was absinthe and at
r.Sght, as there was no amusement, they
would sit around a table, singing song3
and telling stories that were none too
coherent. Occasionally there would be
a row.
One morning; I came to breakfast and
There had been three engineers of the
French marine sent out to put these
boats together. They did not like the
prospect, i*nd said it could not be done,
and the commandant of the marine of
the upper Mobangui was in a great
predicament. There was the expedition
of Marchand to go up the river and no
boats to go in. Commandant Morain's
fleet consisted of three other boats. The
of these had been condemned. The third
I helped to overhaul and set started.
The two new boats looked as though
ready for the scrap heap, but I looked
them over and took the contract of
building one from the remains of the
two.

When I arrived at Brazzaville in 1890
it was a place of only three or four
houses for the officials and a trading
post, the headquarters of the company
by which I was employed. In 1836 it
had become a place of importance. Mar
chand's expedition was there.
McClintock and I soon found there
was no way of getting our loads up
country, as Marchand was using every
carrier for his own loads and was send
ing out armed companies to recruit ad
ditional carriers. It would be six
months, said the officials of the com
pany, before we could expect our
thing*. They were greatly behind with
their own goods, and now Marchand's
requirements had demoralized every
thing.
After resting several days McClin
tock was offered a place with the trad
ing company, and got a contract to
erect a steamboat for the French sov
ernrrfent. The steamer had been on the
caravan route from Loango for over
two years. There had been two of
them, galvanized steel hulls, seventy
by twelve feet beam, compound engine
with tunnel screw, to draw eighteen
inches of water. They were for explora
tion and the hull was cut across *in
eight sections, so as to be bolted to
g-ether and taken apart, each section
weighing some 500 pounds after rivet
ing together. They were sent up coun
try from Loango In pieces, the ribs and
plates separate and the cylinders in
sections, and all cut up into sixty
pound loads. The boiler was a tubular
concern, with -250 tubes and a steam
joint at each end. These boats had
been abandoned by the native carriers,
parts of them had been stolen to make
spears and the brass work had been
made into bracelets, anklets and other
ornaments for the dusky beauties. The
natives melted over the brass and
made it into their currency. What was
too hie to steal was left out in the
heavy tropical rains and moisture, and
when it arrived at Brazzaville the parts
left over were simply ruined. The
stuff would never have reached Braz
zaville at all had no^ the government
sent an armed force, which made sev
eral demonstrations by burning a few
villages and killing the inhabitants.
Then the natives disgorged the stolen
property.
Brazzaville is situated on the north
bank of the Congo, just above this rap

view of the whole pool. It was named
after the explorer, Francais de Brazza,
who came very near forestalling Stan

Here at Brazzaville is the seat of the
government of the Upper Mobangui,
fast becoming one of the most exten

We arrived at Brazzaville after four
teen days' walking and two days' rest
at Manyangaâ a tedious trip of 250
miles around the unnavigable portion
of the lower Congo. Some of the rapids
in this portion of the Congo are terrific,
wasting force enough to supply prac
tically unlimited electric power. The
first falls of this series of rapids are
ninety miles from the river's mouth,
at Matadi. If it were not for the rapids
ocean steamers might run to Stanley
Pool, 300 miles from the coast. Here the
river widens out into a great lake, thir
teen miles long and eight and ten miles
wide. There in an immense, swampy
island in this lake covering two-thirds
of* its area, and on this island the hip
popotamus and buffalo reign supreme.
Toward the western end the pool nar
rows and flows into a gorge. Here the
water passes over the first rapids and
falls, looking much like the rapids
above Niagara, only the latter are in
miniature compared. with those of the
Congo.

"It is more likely, however, to denote

in the earth's crust at that pointâ such

Without banks the business of this country could not
be transacted, because it requires that the. loan, fund
of the country shall be somewhere centered and in reach
of those who require to. use their credit in business.
The enterprise of the country is kept moving by bor
rowers. In this State every large enterprise, from ship
building to ranching, requires V the use of credit and
borrowed capital, which would be impossible without
banks. The slow and backward countries of the world
are those that have the least banks,) or none at all. In
them money has little, or no ntobility, and its wealth
producing capacity is impaired or is entirely lacking.
Enterprise bbrrows money of banks, engages it in con
struction or production, pays the wages of labor, and
thereby it enters the most active circulation and finds
its way back to the banks, to begin again its round -of
activity and promotion.
This circulation of money by the medium of banks may
be compared to the restless activity of water, governed
by the laws of gravity and evaporation. ' Evaporated
from the bosom of the sea, the moisture is condensed, is
carried by the air currents to the land and precipitated
upon the mountains, whence gravity carries it back to
the sea. But on its journey it has turned many wheels;
its power has lighted cities, run streetcars, lighted mines,
pulled trains, impelled stamp mills, crushed ores and
ground wheat. It has irrigated many acres, produced
many crops, quenched the thirst of man and brute,
cleansed clothing, sprinkled streets, and in the spray of
fountains has delighted thousands; has given the power
to engines that pull to market what it has produced, and
yet not a drop is destroyed or lost, and it all finds its
way back to the great reservoir, to begin again its end
less round of activity, and service, controlled by the laws
of evaporation, precipitation and gravity.
So it is with capital, with money. It flows in a
creative stream, leaving behind railroads it has built,
cities it has erected, land it has cleared, harbors it has
made accessible, docks it has built, warehouses it has
constructed and filled, fibers and food it has produced,
churches, schools and banks and works of art and com
fort and splendor, and yet it has not destroyed itself
by all this labor, but flows in full tide into and out of
its reservoirs, with its activity unimpaired as long as
man's confidence in his judgment and the future gives
him courage to use it.
To say that the banks can lock it up and keep it
away from the people is to utter a vain and foolish
thing. It does not belong to the banks. They are only
its custodians. ' Its owners, the people who deposit it,
have it always under control, and by simply writing
presenting a check each owner can take what is his
out of the bank, and do with it as he pleases. When
money is locked up, the depositors turn the key. We
had that kind of sequestration of money in. the last
panic, and notably upon Bryan's nomination in 1896.
Enormous sums were checked out of the banks all over
the country and cither hidden at home by itsv owners,
or put into the steel vaults of safe deposit companies.
It "was withdrawn efficiently from use, until the scare
was over. After the election confidence was restored
and this money, withdrawn by its frightened owners,
came out of hiding, went again to the banks and thence
started on its work of turning wheels 'and buying and
building and producing. While it was hidden the banks
were powerless. They could not lock it up, for they did
not have it. If money gets tight, it is because its.
owners are frightened.
Such vain and foolish talk as that of the Examiner is
one of the influences which scare the owners of money.
It is a misrepresentation of the power of banks as well
as of the intentions of bankers. If many newspapers
indulge in such expressions, confidence may decrease
and money begin to go into hiding. Then enterprise
slows down, there is less work, and less wages, and the
circulation of money gets slower, and labor suffers most
and longest. No friend of the workingmen of the coun
try ever tries to scare capital, but on the contrary, seeks
to keep it buoyant and confident. No friend of labor
and enterprise ever seeks to inflame prejudice against
[banks, for without them business, on a scale beneficial
to all, is impossible.
THE Examiner has discovered an intention on the
part of the bankers of the country to say to "the
people of the United States, 'either you shall buy
our industrial securities which are worthless, or we will
lock up the money of the country and starve you into
letting go of your legitimate holdings.' "
As Mr. Hearst recently assured the wealth of the
country that he would be a safe man in the Presidency,
why does he make this blue-bosh appeal to the popular
prejudice against banks? It is a fact that nothing is
easier than to raise a prejudice against banks. They arc
the reservoirs of the surplus capital of'the country, and
act as trustees for its owners. Whether they join the
function of banks of currency issue and commercial
business, or are banks of deposit and cdmmerce only,
or receive and loan deposits and pay interest on .them,
as savings banks, they are trustees of the owners of the
money which they handle. Even in the case of savings
banks there are those who ignorantly regard them as
guilty of keeping millions of money out of circulation,
when in reality they join the small capital of millions
of people and put it in circulation on security that is
regulated by law.'
A retired police officer grew reminis
cent the other night in the police re
porters' room and told of some start
ling adventures he had in his years of
active service. "Those were great
days," he said, "when, if an officer ar
rested a man near the Five-mile House
he would have to drag him, fighting
every inch of the way, to Seventeenth
street. And Ohe officer, while trying to
keep his prisoner from gouging his eyes
out or biting off an ear, would have to
fight a gang of hoodlums, friends of the
prisoner, intent on taking him away
from the hated 'cop'.
"I will never forget a mix-up I had
with the old Bernal Heights gang. I
arrested one of the gang one Saturday
night, after a fight that started at
Twenty-fourth street and ended at the
station house. It cost me my gun, club
and handcuffs and lots of skin and
blood, but the man was landed. The
gang swore to get even and came near
doing it.
"A few nights after the arrest I saw
the members of the gang mistreating,
a poor cow that was staked out on a
hill. I started after them and they ran,
turning occasionally to hoot at me.
They ran into a big barn. I followed
and, as I entered the door, I saw the
last one of the scoundrels disappearing
into the loft. Up I went after them,
and though the place was dark I could
see them standing in a corner ready for
me. Drawing my club and pistol, I
made a rush, but I never reached them.
When I recovered consciousness in the
hospital they told me they had found
me along toward morning on the lower
floor of the barn. I had fallen through
a hole the devils had carefully covered
with a piece of canvas and hay and
then made the stand just to coax me
to run right into it."
In the Olden Time.
Somehow the African fevers are far
more malignant some years than otlr^
ers. At the pool that year nearly
everybody taken ill died. The mortal
ity was terrible all up and down the
Congo. Every one was afraid. One
Sunday morning upon coming to
breakfast the acting commissary was
not there. He was an industrious man
and drank little, never said much and
took a back seat at everything. He was
sick. No one thought anything about
it. In two hours he was dead. It was
a shock to see a big, hearty fellow go
like that, and for several days our
little circle was under a cloud. In the
meantime the sick engineer was sent
home, and I was left with only one.
He became despondent, and in a few
days would not say a word to any one
and tried to commit suicide several
times, but always failed. At last they
locked him up and sent him home with
an escort.
After many difficulties the boat was
finally finished, and ran well. Long
before Commandant Morain told me it
was for the Marchand expedition, and
that they would make me any voffer
I would accept to take it across the
country and put it up on the yile. This
suited me exactly, as it would take me
into the country McCllntock and I
wanted to go to. I made the agree
ment that the Government was to
bring up our loads from Matadi, in
cluding the guns taken from us, and
at last we were independent.
In the meantime McClintock had
gone to the Quello River, a branch of
the Kassai. The trading company had
aereed^o send him up there for a trip
while I was at work on the boat. He
was to be gone a year, and then we
were to meet at Brazzaville, and from
there go into the interior to do the
work we had planned.

looking very groggy. They had been
up all night nursing their comrade, who
had become queer and wanted to swim
a race with a crocodile. "When I went

ment to customers to deal with the combine rather than
with its rivals. But it seems that Lord Coleridge and
the Court of Appeals, which affirmed his decision, left
out of fhe case certain elements which American courts
properly include 'in the issue. There are others who
have' rights besides the shipper and the transporter of
merchandise.
The shipper buys in the market that -is open to all,
and he sells in the market at the same price as that ob
tained by all sellers. If he have a more favorable rate
of transportation that is not open to all shippers he is
injuring both the producer and the consumer, for he
shares with neither the profit of his low rate. We have
a case in point in this State* in the rebates on fruit
transportation given by the owners of refrigerator cars
to the president of the Porter Bros. Company. These
rebates v gave him a profit of nearly t\Vo millions. But
he paid to the producers no more and sold to the con
sumers no cheaper. The profit of the secret rate went
into his pocket only. If the owners of the fruit can>
could afford to ship at the less rate which he alone en
joyed they could afford it to all and both producer and
consumer would share the advantage. Under such cir
cumstances our American courts properly look beyond
the shipper and the transportation company and con
sider the interests of the public, of the great unorgan
ized community of producers and consumers.
The statutes covering restraint j>i trade are capable
of much enlargement. The readers of the history of
the Standard Oil Company that has been running in one
of the popular magazines have been made familiar with
the methods of Mr. Rockefeller in monopolizing the oil
trade. Where other than his oil is sold he destroys
competition by putting down the price in that locality,
so that his competitor cannot meet his price and has to
go out of business. As soon as competition is destroyed
the price of Rockefeller's oil in that place is put at
the market level again. Now it is within the power of
Congress in controlling -interstate commerce to com
pel Rockefeller to reduce, his price everywhere to the,
level of the place in which he reduces it to destroy com
petition. This would disarm him by compelling him to
do business everywhere at d loss.
The legal analogy between his method and transpor
tation rebates is complete. It is equally in restraint of
trade and subversive of competition. Such a law would
immediately destroy the Standard Oil monopoly, for
there is capital enough in the country to install compe
tition at so many points- that even Rockefeller's colossal
capital would not stand the strain of doing business
everywhere and selling to every consumer at a loss.
The principles upon which the Supreme Court affirmed
the constitutionality of the interstate commerce act
apply to such a statute as we suggest, which would make
it less possible for great, trusts to monopolize trade and
would thereby remove the inducement to combine.

MAYOR UPHOLDS
HIS APPOINTEE
Vetoes the Ordinance That
Might Deprive Poundmaster
H. 0. Irwin of His Place
Mayor Schmitz yesterday returned
to the Board of Supervisors without
his approval the ordinance recently
passed taking from him the power of
appointing a poundmaster. The ordi
nance was passed after an Investiga
tion by the Finance Committee rela
tive to the administration of H. O. Ir
wln, who was appointed poundmaster
by the Mayor. The fact tlu*t his honor
would veto the bill was published in
The Call when the measur<| was finally
passed by the board.' Â»
In his veto message Mar or Schmitz
states that the bill is airbed directly
at him and he fails to Bee Ir
wln has been neglectful *, I his-duty.
The only count upon which Irwin was
deemed found guilty of neglect was
that he allowed cattle to roam at large
and as an excuse for this Irwln stated
that this was the result of the cutting
down of his appropriation by the Su
pervisors.
Mayor Schmitz does not think that
the board will succeed in overriding
his veto by the necessary fourteen
votes. The Mayor counts on the votes
of Supervisors Alpers, Bent, Rea, Wil
son and Walsh, who voted the
measure, to sustain his yeto, which
will leave but thirteen Supervisors to
override It, one short of the number
required.
A Good Business Policy.
A toed merchant will not Carry stock from
one eeason to another. He will dispose of
everything at the end of each season In order
to make room for the new things. With this
object in view Strauss & Frohman, 107 Post
street, will begin to-morrow the January
clearance eale. Ready-to-wear garment de
partment, cloaks, eults, waists and skirts, will
be the principal one affected, as about 1000
garments are to be disposed of at Immense re
duction. â¢
A woman can't feel dressed up and
feel comfortable, too.
A horse and buggy driven by an un
known man collided with an electric
car at Third and Bryant streets
shortly after midnight yesterday.
The driver, for some reason, disap
peared. The animal, a bay mare, was
killed. A policeman took the buggy to
the livery stable at 825 Folsom street.
The owner of the rig has not yet made
himself known to the police.
Owner of Rig Wanted.
The grill will have a seating capac
ity of 100 persons, including a small
banquet-room, which will seat thirty.
The organizers promise that every
thing will be strictly high grade and
that there will be no better place to
dine in San Francisco than at the Jef
ferson Square Club.
A sideboard has been provided from
which the ""best of everything obtain
able will be served, not only in the
grillroom, but throughout the club,
where small tables will be arranged at
close intervals with plenty of chairs.
Other conveniences have been ar
ranged, such as private dressing-rooms
(including lockers), for both ladies
and gentlemen; a private telephone
exchange and a barber shop adjacent
to the gentlemen's dressing room.
Arrangements have been made with
the Pioneer -Automobile Company for
the storage, without charge, of guests'
automobiles at any hour of the day
and^ night while they are in the club
rooms. Every effort will be made to
keep the membership list exclusive so
that wives and families of members
will feel at liberty to entertain in the
clubrooms at any time.
Among them are: Henry J. Crock
er, William Greer Harrison, E. M.
Greenway, Henry D. Morton, R. M.
Davis, Major Rochester, U. S. A.;
Charles C. Moore, E. E. Stoddard, Mil
ton -Bremmer, Dr. Birdsall, Dr. How
ard Morrow, Edward H. Hammer, Roy
Welden, Harry Ward, James Bender,
Albert Bender and Frank Kerrigan.
The directors and other officers have
not yet been elected, but probably will
be chosen from the above-named men.
Several unique features for the com
fort and pleasure of the guests are
promised. There are to be bowling al
leys reserved for ladles between 2 and
4 o'clock each day, when free instruc
tion will be given by a professional in
structor. Alleys for individual clubs
and private parties may be specially
reserved. Billiard and pool tables have
also been provided.
A novel convenience to be intro
duced in the dining-room will be the
equipment of each table with a tele
phone, wiiereby guests may communi
cate with the outside world while en-
Joying their repast.
AN UP-TO-DATE GRILL.
A new club is to be opened at an
early date in San Francisco that will
include many members of the Bo
hemian, Family, Cosmos, Press, Union
League and University, clubs and a
ladles' department for any of the fair
sex to whom the members wish to ex
tend courtesies.
The chief diversion of the club i3
to be bowling, alleys having been pro
vided for 100 players. There are many
devotees of this eport in San Francis
co among the fair sex, but they bowl
when' out of town during the summer
months, giving it up when they \ re
turn because there is no bowling club
in existence here.
The new organization will be named
"Jefferson Square Club" and will oc
cupy the entire upper floor of the Pio
neer Automobile Company's building
at 901 to 925 Golden Gate avenue, op
posite Jefferson Square.
The clubrooms are being handsome
ly furnished and decorated prepara
tory to the opening on January 10.
Several well-known men are inter
ested in the growth of the new club
and their names alone would be suf
ficient to popularize it.

The funeral services of the late Jo
seph B. Crockett took place yesterday
niorning at Grace Church, .corner
of Stockton and California streets. A
large number of prominent people,
friends and acquaintances of the de
ceased, attended the services. Rev.
Dr. Parsons of San Mateo, "the late
home of Mr. Crockett, r^ead the fun
eral services. Appropriate music was
rendered. There was a large number
of floral pieces of beautiful design,
Joseph Crockett Is Burled.
The Corona Club Is in a flourishing
condition, and is maintaining its nu
merical strength, with a large number
of applicants waiting for death or other
causes' to reduce the number below 200
so they may be admitted.
The monthly session of the Corona
Literary Club of the Mission in the
Mission Masonic Hall was a most en
joyable one, and despite the holiday
season there was a large attendance of
Interested members.
Mrs. W. D. Littleton gave a most In
teresting lecture on the "Cathedrals of
England, Their Historic Associations
and Artistic Beauty." Dr. H. J. Stewart
gave a comprehensive lecture on
"American Composers." He said that
the time is not far distant when the
composers of 'America will take rank
with the best European ones. Some al
ready equal them in certain lines, but
dramatic quality Is lacking in this,
that the American opera writers can
not obtain a hearing. "The great ora
torios we have produced," he said, "are
Parker's 'Nora Novlsslmo,' Buck's
'Light of Asia' and Chadwlck's 'Judith.'
McDowell and Chadwick are the best
orchestral writers. Arthur Foote is full
of genius. Arthur Kelly's music in
'Ben Hur,' while mutilated, is really
great. Paderewski prizes for best
American composition have so far been
won by H. K. Hawley, with 'The Four
Seasons,' and Parker with the cantata
'The Star Song.' John K. Paine's music
for 'Arlstophane's Birds' is a classic
that ranks with Mendelssohn. One of
the best American composers is Hora
tio Parker, professor of music at Yale,
and the most popular is Ethelbert
Nevin. Mrs. Beach wrote a mass In B
flat and an orchestral overture, both of
which are good." Attention was called
to the fact that there are a number of
earnest workers on the Pacific Coast,
among them being Oscar "Well, H. B.
Passmore, Aloys Lajeal and Luchessl
in this city. J. W. Metcalf in Oakland
and Fred Stevenson in Los Angeles,
who are equal to many Eastern men.
The next on the [ programme was
"time for vocal selections." Miss Jen
kins sang "Ecstacy" and "The Black
bird," by Mrs. Beach; Miss Mabel Hogg
sang a lullaby by Fisher and "Aufs
Wiedersehen," by Cole; Miss Jewell
sang a "Folk Song," by Chadwick; Miss
Frank rendered "Land of the Leal," by
Foote, and "The Dancer," by Chad
wick; Miss Florence Derby sang "In
the "Woods," by McDowell, and "At
Parting," by J. H. Rogers; Miss Julia
Groeninger sang "Secreta," a beautiful
composition by Professor Stewart, and
"She Wears a Rose in Her Hair," by
Hawley.
Another part of the session was the
programme provided by the club. Dr.
Crockett spoke on current events, the
topic being "Science in Medicine." The
doctor stated that in the great mass of
population in the United States, more
than 70,000,000, there are less than 12,000
scientific men. The talk by the doctor
also included an Interesting account of
the radium and the Finsen ray. Miss
Standart spoke in "The Lighter Vein"
and told of the improvements that San
Francisco hopes to have in its civic life
and government. Mrs. Peltretgave a
biography of Mary E. Wllkins, giving
many details' of the life and work of
that interesting woman. Mrs. Fairchild
spoke of Mary E. Johnstone as a dainty
bit of Southern beauty, and described
the trend of her work. Mrs. Gabb'a
paper was on Helen Keller's wonderful
life and experiences in overcoming the
great disability of her physical imper
fections.

Atlantic City has a motor car which
is used solely for the purpose of haul-
Ing intoxicated prisoners to the police
station at this popular resort this sea
son.
The institution proposes during the
coming spring to issue the first of its
publications on work already accom
plished.
At the close of th> session the trus
tees and their wives were banqueted at
the New Willard Hotel by Mr. and Mrs.
Carnegie.
United States Circuit Judge W. W.
Morrow and his wife returned home
on Christmas night from a visit to
Washington, D. C, where the Judge
had been attending a two days' session
of the Carnezie Institution, of which
he is the trustee representing the Pa
cific Coast.
The session began on December 8 and
was attended by Mr- Carnegie.. The
result of the deliberations was the map
ping out of much work for the coming
year, and the appropriation of $373,000
therefor.
One of the most important expedi
tions Drovided for by the Institutim
is that of Professor Alexander Agassiz
of Cambridge, Mass.. who will start in
the United States steamer Albatross
from this city next fall, to explore the
abysmal fauna and the contour of the
bed of the ocean east of the Samoan
Islands to the South American coast.
This work will Include deep sea dredg
ing and has never been done in that
part of the globe. Hence it is expected
that the result of the expedition will
be a valuable crntributton to modern
science.
Another projected expedition Is that
of Professor Pumpelly, who will make
a preliminary inquiry Into the archae
logical and physiological aspect of the
region beyond the Caspian Sea. which
investigation, it is expected, will illum
inate .many historical and geological
problems as to that portion of the
world.
Next week all the organizations of
the National Guard of California will
resume drills and place themselves In
a position to remedy the mistakes of
the previous year that were so severe
ly commented upon by those who con
ducted the inspections. The officers of
the many commands have expressed a
determination to rehabilitate the
guard and to have the men acquire
as much military knowledge as can
be imparted/ to them in the limited
time they devote to such matters in
the course of a year outside of what
instructions they receive while in
camp.
Colonel TVilhelm will commence his
inspections as the representative of
the War Department during the early
part of January and will continue in
that duty until every organization has
been inspected. - The inspections will
not be merely perfunctory ones, but
will be as close as they are conducted
in the United States army. Every good
feature will be commended and every
objectionable one will be noted and
commented upon for the good of the
guard. If the suggestions offered by
Colonel Wilhelm during informal talks
to different bodies of the guard have
been carried out by those to whom
they were directed, the reports will be
creditable to the guard.
There will be a renewal of the in
structions to the officers of the Naval
Militia during January and these will
be continued until each officer will be
in a position to fully understand his
duties if called upon to do service at
sea.

Sues for Money Paid for Land.
Eugenia T. Larsen, administratrix
of the estate of Frederic T. Larsen,
brought suit yesterday against C. W.
Hubbard and the Park Lumber Com
pany to recover money paid by Lar
sen to the defendants for land on the
Gualala Pilver. She alleges that the
value of the land was fraudulently
"This city has grossly neglected its
accepted streets for more than a third
of a century. The accumulated neg
lect and deficiency amounts to more
than $1,021,000, and the recent authori
zation*of a bond issue for this amount
and interest to repair accepted streets
is intended as a partial atonement and
remedy. The ill-advised 'dollar limit'
is in part the cause of this neglect, for
the rigid and impossible obligations of
the charter are met with the niggardly
denial of the means to carry out its
requirements. We are therefore called
upon to pay for $1,621,000 worth of work
and then $1,163,067 DO of interest on the
same.
"The forces and materials possibly
available in this city are capable of
doing thoroughly about $250,000 worth
of work per year and a charter amend
ment permitting the raising of this
amount each year for ten years for
the specific purpose of repairing and
repavlng accepted streets would do this
work as fast as It can economically be
done, would carry out thi sound busi
ness principle, 'pay as you go,' and
would give $2,500,000 worth of work in
stead of paying principal and interest,
$2,784,067 50, for only $1,621,000 worth of
work.
"L/ct us hope, however, that in repav
ing Market street under this bond is
sue a more suitable and better class
of wearing surface may be selected,
such, for instance, as that on CJrant
avenue, and that some means may be
found to stop tearing it up between
the commencement and end of the
work, and of continuing this destruc
tive process during the life of the pave
ment, thereby shortening its period of
service to less than one-half its dura
bility under traffic."
CITY NEGLECTS STREETS.
"So often has this tearing up been
done by various corporations that it Is
hardly possible to start at the curb
stone on Market street and walk to the
other side and take two consecutive
steps that do not lie over a pipe or a
conduit of some kind. At the time this
pavement was laid it was known to en
gineers acquainted with the best prac
tice of their profession in these matters
that bituminous rock was not the best
material for this part of Market street.
TJ?ere was not in the employ of the
city at that time any one competent to
test or pass upon the materials used,
did the city own or control the appli
ances for such tests.
"The city authorities on January 8,
1900, therefore found themselves party
to an unconstitutional and vitiated
contract which their own legal adviser
declared illegal. Desiring, however, to
make the best of this miserable bar
gain, they nevertheless tried to control
the cutting up of this pavement, as the
court record of arrests and trials will
show.
"The impossibility of enforcing thl3
repair clause of these contracts is
therefore apparent. Nevertheless, one
of the contracting firms repaired that
portion of Market street paved by it
without cost to the city, except where
these repairs were due to tearing up
the street by water and light compa
nies.
"Before the new pavement had been
down many months the work of de
struction commenced and by the time
the charter went into effect on January
8, 1900, the contracts had been\ vitiated
many times over by the exercise of
this 'right' by various companies sup
plying gas, water, etc -
"It will be noted that the. insertion
qf this obligation in these contracts re
quiring the contractor under bond to
do that which corporations furnishing
water and light had a constitutional
right to do for themselves must have
been at the outset unconstitutional.
Moreover, the city authorities per
mitted these contracts to be vitiat
ed before the charter went "into
effect. In addition to this, the;City
Attorney rendered an opinion on Feb
ruary 27, 1901 (opinions City Attorney,
1899-1902, page 419), to the effect that
the city could not legally impose the
obligation of maintaining a street In
repair, basing this opinion on decisions
of the Supreme Court of this State,
(98 Cal. 10: 32 Pac. Rep. 702; 130 Cal.'
226, on a similar in 33 Oregon 307.)
REPAIRS IN CONTRACT.
"Section 19, article XI of the consti
tution of the State of California per
mits corporations furnishing light and
water, etc., to tear up and restore the
pavements of the cities and towns of
this State. This 'constitutional right'
was given these corporations during the
troublous Kearney times, by reason of
the fear on the part of San Francisco
that the water and gas companies
might get some way of perpetuating
themselves and of shutting out compe
tition by^local legislation; hence this
general right was inserted in the con
stitution. This 'constitutional â¢ right'
has been upheld by the "courts. (137

Commissioner of Works Marsden
Manson yesterday isBued the following
statement regarding the bad condition
of the Market-street pavement and the
reasons for the same:
"So much untruth has been published
about the Market-street pavement from
Second to Ninth streets that a few
facts may 6erve to correct some of tha
malignant falsehoods that have been
paraded before this community.
"Between May and December, 1898.
the Board of Supervisors determined
to take up the basalt blocks on Market
street within the limits above men
tioned and to pave the same. with bi
tuminous rock. Specifications were
prepared and contracts entered into
with two firms for thfs work- Bonds
were rectuired to keep this work In re
pair for five (5) yeari, or until 190S.
One of the conditions of these bonds
was that whenever the city, permitted
this work to be torn up or opened for
any purpose the contractor under bond
was to replace and restore the pava
ment.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.â War De
partment officials admit that the
transports Sumner and McClellan, at
New York, as well as the Sherman.
Buford and Crook, at San Francisco,
are being fitted out for active service.
The two vessels at New York have
been in a state of readiness for sev
eral weeks, but so far no calls have
been made for them. It is expected
that one of them will be utilized in
bringing to the United States the ar
tillery troops now stationed near Ha
vana and at Santiago de Cuba. Pri
marily all of these transports are in
tended for the Manila service.

MADE READY FOR SERVICE

PORTLAND, Or.. Dec. 26.â With the
export lumber market a wreck and a
big rate war threatened, the lumbermen
; of the coast are wondering if another
war is to be precipitated between the
Hill and Harriman lines toward the
Cast. Harriman is said to have de
manded of the Hill lines that they raise
the rate between Puget Sound and
Minnesota points to 50 cents, threaten
ing to extend the 40-cent rate over the
Union Pacific into Omaha and common
points if the increase is not made.
Should the northern lines refuse to
advance ' their rate to St. Paul and
common points and the Harriman lines
should extend the 40-cent rate into the
Omaha district the lumbering business
of Oregon, Eastern "Washington and
Idaho would be greatly stimulated, and
the northern lines, which now handle
the bulk of lumber shipments eastward,
would suffer considerably. The Omaha
district would be opened up to the lum
bermen of "Washington and Oregon by
a direct route into Omaha at a rate 10
cents cheaper than afforded over the
Burlington or the other lines via St.
Paul. The latter roads would be forced
to extend the 40-cent rate from St. Paul
to Omaha. This would result in a rate
war that would at least furnish pleas
ing shipping prices for the lumberman.
On the other hand, if the Hill inter
ests advanced the rate the lumbermen
would find themselves facing a demor
alized market and an increase* rate,
that would undoubtedly have a serious
effect upon the business. And as far
as the railroads are concerned, if the
Hill lines advance the rate the Harri
man roads will have an advantage in
being able to place the lumber in
Omaha for 50 cents, while the northern
roads would only take if* to St. Paul
and common points. "While this would
be a decided advantage to the Harri
man interests, it would be a serious
blow to the Eastern lumber business on
thecoast. Â¦â¢; ..;^ v o"r \?-

'Frost, the San Francisco attorney who

pointment raised a storm of protest
here, has written a strong letter to
Senators Fultoa and Mitchell denying
the- allegations made against his char
acter.
The rpecia! reason for Frost's letter
is the ".tter which th~ Oregon Sen
ators wrote to Att .ley General Knox,
objecting to Frost's appointment.
Frost's letter is very lengthy, and is
couched in parts in b" <?r language.
He gives excerpts from an Attorney

good character is di' Â¦*Â«â¢â¢*. upon, and
asks that public retraction be made
by the Senators, and, in closing, dis
claims all person:.". Â»-' -us. In one
portion o* the letter Frost says: "No

the Government can or v. . compensate
for the suffering and loss your letter
has occasioned."

SAN BERNARDINO, Dec. 26.â To be
invited to a house for a Christmas din
ner and to receive as a souvenir of the
occasion a load of bird shot in his face
was the peculiar and painful experience
of A- P. Maguire. who manages the
Glen Helen ranch for T. E. Parker.
John Doyle, a well-known old bache
lor rancher, who lives near the Glen
Helen ranch, invited Maguire to his
house. Maguire went early, and the
two began to drink wine and whisky
before breakfast. At 4 o'clock in the
afternoon they were in a mood to have
trouble, and the expected happened.
Magulre's story makes Doyle owe him
530. The debt is of several years' stand-
Ing and is the result of work which Ma
guire had performed for Doyle.
Yesterday Maguire demanded the
money about the time he was ready to
go home, and said he intended to bring
suit if the coin was net forthcoming.
The money was not paid, and Doyle in
stead unlimbered his shotgun for action
and fired at Maguire. who was but a
few feet away. . Part of the charge
struck Maguire. A piece of his cheek
was torn away and the entire left side
of his face was sprinkled with fine shot
One eye will have to be removed and
the sight of the other may be~ destroyed.
Maguire is of the opinion that a delib
erate attempt was made to murder him.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 26. â The Cor

Mack, who was killed by a fall from
the roof of the St. Charles Hotel, after
being struck on the head with a chair
in the hands of Thomas Finch, to-day
returned a verdict to the effect that
Mack came to his death as a result of
the fall and not from the blow from
the chair. This clears Finch of the
charge of murder, but does not en
tirely exonerate him.

SHARP LETTER
FOR SENATORS
Kanch Manager Invited to
Christmas Dinner Receives a
Charge of Bird Shot in Face
V. Berg, Vice Governor of the island
of Panape, who has been a guest at
the Lick House for several days, is
minus 5180 as a result of some mys
terious manipulation of his pocket
book, which he and the police have
been unable to solve. On Christmas
day he visited the office of Cook &.
Sons, where he exchanged a number
of German marks for American cur
rency. He immediately put the 520
bills, amounting in all to 51S0, in his
wallet, then carefully placed the latter
in an inside pocket of his coat and
started with a friend back to the Lick
House, where they had luncheon.
After the meal Berg and his friend
had occasion to go to the hotel office,
where the German official was sur
prised by the clerk handing him his
wallet, and more so when he discovered
that the currency was missing. The
clerk explained that he had just
picked up the wallet on the counter
and supposed that the guest had loft
it there. Bex?, however, insisted that
he had not touched it after leaving
Cook &. Sons' office. Later he reported
the matter to Captain of Detectives
Martin. The latter failed to solve the
mystery of the disappearance of the
wallet and its return to the hotel with
out its- contents, but he did suggest
to the angry German that it was pos
sible he had failed to stow the weiÂ£*sfc
in his pocket as he had supposed, and
that while on his v;ay to the Lick it
had slipped from un4er his overcoat
and when found by some pedestrian
had been emptied of his contents and
returned to the desk of the hotel, by
the obliging person.

The firemen dried the clothing of the
woman and notified the police. The pa
trol wagon from the Park station was
sent out to take Mrs. Landbsck and
her little boy to the Central Emergency
Hospital.
When asked to tell why she had tried
to kill herself and also take the life of
her child Mrs. Landbeck said:
"My husband. Eugene Landbeck, has
driven me to thla. I was married to
him about two years ago, and my little
boy is just a year old. My husband
works at the Union Iron Works and
makes good wages. But he- has been
very unkind to me. He has struck me
at times, but his words have been the
worst of all. He has threatened to have
me locked up in an Insane asylum and
take my child away. from me. Then he
would say that he hated children and
that . the child was not his. He has
given me no money for two months,
and he has stayed away from home for
days at a time.
"I made up my mind to get a divorce
from him, and I went to a lawyer, but
I was tired of giving the lawyer money
every, time I .went to see him. r I did not
see my husband . on Christmas day.
Every one was . happy .but me, and I
was so miserable that I mode up my
mind to, end It ail." . ''"*!'',.:

With great' Taylor and

water and carried her to a safe spot.
While one of the men guarded her the
other proceeded after the child and
took it to the mother.
irez were standing. They held each
other's hands and with feet firmly
braced in a crevice of the rock they
managed to catch hold of the woman
as she was swept along past the spot.
The mother's instinct evidently was
uppermost" in the mind \>t the unfortu
nate woman, for a3 the young men
grasped her she cried out, "My child;
save my child."
RESCUED WITH DIFFICULTY.
She walked around on the bluffs and
finally proceeded down the incline that
Iead3 to the water's edge. Tenderly
she carried her child in her arms and
approached the slippery rocks that
skirt the bottom of the bluff.
J. E. Taylor and A. Ramirez, who
reside at 825 Natoma street, were out at
Land's End enjoying the balmy sun
shine. They noticed Mrs. Landbeck
and her' child about fifty feet away
from them. She was sitting on a rock
that Jutted out into the water, which
was then at high tide.
Suddenly the young men were horri
fied to see Mrs. Landbeck place her.
child on the ground and with a de-.
spalring cry jump into the dashing sea.
The rapid tide carried the woman to
ward the rock where Taylor and Ram-
"Then I laid my child down on thn
rocks and sprang into the water. I
wanted to meet death, for my husband
has be^n so unkind to me, but I knew
that my child would be found and
taken care of."
Mrs. Landbeck was seen in the vi-.
cinity of Land's End yesterday morn-
Ing, but there was nothing in her man
ner to indicate that ehe contemplated
self-destruction.
NOTICED SITTING ON ROCKS.
"I did intend to take the child with
me," said Mrs. Landbeck, as she lay
last evening on a cot at the Central
Emergency Hospital/ "but the sight of
the cold water and its wild dashing on
the rocks, made me stop in my Inten
tion. I felt then that I could not harm
my child and I waited until I saw two
young men on the rocks some distance
awav.
Driven, to despair by the taunts of
her husband and with no one to offer
a cheering word to her at the festive
holiday season, Mrs. Eugene Landbeck,
the wife of a laborer residing at 15Vj
Oak- Grove avenue, attempted to end
her life yesterday afternoon in the
waters that swirl around the rocks at
Land's End.
But for the timely presence of two
ycung men. J. E. Taylor and A. Ram
irez, the unfortunate woman would
have gained the untimely death that
ehe sought. They succeeded In drag
ging her from the angry water3, al
though they were drenched by the
waves in so doing. Â¦
A pathetic feature of the attempt at
suicide by Mrs. Landbeck was the fact
that she contemplated ending the life
of her little 1-year-old boy, but was de
terred by the sight of the dashing
waves from- harming her offspring. .
Mrs. Landbeck has been married
twice, .according to statements she
made yesterday. She said that her first
husband's name was Ploemer and that
he disappeared.- about ten years ago,
when she was living with him at Sac
ramento, and she has never heard 'of
him since.
The v unfortunate woman is about 37
years old, and the officials at the Emer
gency Hospital stated last night that
she showed no signs of insanity, but
was evidently suffering from depression
and grief. : â¢
Mrs. Landbeck and her child were
detained at the Emergency Hospital
last night. The police will find her hus
band to-day and get his side of the do
mestic story that almost ended - two
lives.
Mrs. Landbeck was asked why she
had placed the money there, and she
said that it was the balance of her
savings earned as a cook before she
married Landbeck.
"I had some money," said the wom
an, "and I drew it all out of the bank.
I put it in' the child's pocket so that
when he was found after my death peo.
pie would be kind to him. .If my hus

Peter F. Dunne, the well-known at
torney, has been appointed chief coun
sel of the law department of the South
ern Pacific Company, and will assume
the duties of his important office with
the new year.
For some time Attorney Dunne has
been actively engaged in representing
the railroad company In litigation be
fore the Federal and State courts, and
ihe fact that he was very familiar with
tiie law work of the railroad was a rea
son for his ce'ection as a regular of-
Seer of the company.
W. F. Herrin, head of the law depart
ment of the Southern Pacific Company,
lias long contemplated the step of ap
polntl&ff a chief counsel to Eerve im
mediately under him in the legal office.
Although the business of the railroad's
Jaw department has doubled in the last
live* years the staff has not been in
creased.
The selection of Attorney Dunne as
chief counsel of the railroad company
i ; a tribute to his many sterling quali
tivs. The offer of the position made by
Mr. Herrin to Mr. Dunne was also ac
companied by one of a flattering nature
y-u regard to salary, sufficient to com
pensate Dunne for relinquishing his
large private law practice.
When it v.as learned a lew days ago
that Attorney Herrin contemplated the
selection of a chief counsel to serve un
der him a number of prominent attor
iicys sought to gain the coveted post.
The selection of Attorney Dunne
came as a surprise to him. as he did
net in any way seek the appointment,
liis immediate superior. Attorney Her
rin, will now have for his aid -one of
the most forceful debaters of the bar
cf California.
"While Attorney Dunne will devote all
his time to the duties of his appoint
ment, he will not entirely relinquish all
private practice, but will attend to a
few important cases outside of the rail
road work when time will permit him
to do so.

LEAVING BABY BOY UPON THE ROCKS
The latest private advices from New
York relative to the affairs cf the
Southern Pacific Company are to the
effect that Jacob Schiff and his rail
road representative, E. H. Harriman,
will soon announce a plan for refund
ing the entire indebtedness of that
road, the feature of their financiering
project being a blanket mortgage that
will cover all the property of the cor
poration. In this manner they ex
pect to relieve the company of some
of its present heavy interest payments.
Some of its mortgages are now draw-
Ing as high as 6 per cent interest and
the plan is to reduce this rate to a 4
per cent basis by means of a new
mortgage. As a preliminary move in
this direction President Harriman has
already issued to the financiers of
Wa.ll street a statement in which he
outlines the policies of both the
Southern Pacific and Union Pacific
railroad systems for the coming year.
In both policies there is marked con
servatism In the way of new under
takings. In this statement, which is
supposed to be of a confidential na
ture, Harriman shows that during the
last three years more than $50,000,000
has been spent by the Southern Pa
cific Company for improvements,
which are chargeable to the capital
account. For the same period the
Union Pacific Company has expended
540,000,000, a portion of which has
been funded under the convertible and
Oregon Short Line mortgages. By
checking the present progressive pol
icy of the two roads It is claimed that
the men who control them will be af
forded the opportunity to bring the
financiering of the two corporations
up to requirements. Harriman is
careful to make note of the deferred
assets and Items of current liabilities
in the Union Pacific balance sheet,
which are considered in need of finan
ciering. He includes items such as
loans made to the Southern Pacific
Company of $15,496,113; advances of
S7, 365,565 made to new lines, and 53,
8 9'J,89o advanced for two steamships,
making a total of 526,562,579. â¢ It is
claimed that these items are free as
sets. On the liabilities side they are
represented in one item of $14,250,000
loans and bills payable, the greater
part of which went to the Southern
Pacific Company. Among the items of
"advances" are the tost of 442.20
miles of new road, 53.76 miles of sid
ing, 15 freight locomotives, 11 pas
senger coaches, 300 freight cars and 2
ocean 6teamships, each of 13,500 tons
capacity. No effort is made to item
ize the work accomplished along the
lines of the Southern Pacific Company
with the money advanced by the
Union Pacific Company, but the
statement bears enough data to sat
isfy the average financier that the
Southern Pacific is far enough in the
debt of the Union Pacific to warrant
some action toward placing It on a
footing where its interest bearing ob
ligations may be materially decreased,
and this is said to be Schiff and Har
riman's plan.

Mr. Meyers* four years' term as
Labor Commissioner expired April 10,
1903. but he is not accused of working
overtime. The term of the . adjutant
general is at the pleasure of the Gov
ernor. Mr. Fitzgerald's term as Prison
Director, according to the new Blue
Book, ends January 12,' 1904. Some time
ago there was a deal of gossip In the
political camps to the effect that Gov
ernor Pardee had resolved to reappoint
Mr. Fitzgerald. Republican leaders
throughout the State are said to be
earnestly in favor of the appointment
of a Republican, so that the political
complexion of the board, which haa
been Democratic ever since the admin
istration of Governor Budd, may be
changed.
Among the Republican aspirants for
a place on the board arc Edgar J. de
Pue, Charles M. Belshaw and Charles

Thomas J. Walsh or his successor in
the office of Registrar of Voters will
surely have the opportunity of visiting:
Washington, D. C, at the expense of
the nation. In ,the contested election
case of Kahn against Llvernash Mr.
Galnes of West Virginia recently sub
mitted the following to the House of
Representatives:
"The Committee on Elections No. 1.
to which was referred the contested
election case of Julius Kahn, contest
ant, against Edward J. Llvernash, con
testee, from the Fourth Congressional
District of California, respectfully \re
ports to the Plouse the following resolu
tion, approved by said committee, for
approval and adoption by the House,
with the' recommendation that it do
pass:
"Resolved, That Thomas J. Walsh,
Registrar of Voters for the city and
county of San Francisco, or any suc
cessor of his in said office, be, and he
Is hereby ordered to be and appear be
fore Elections Committee, No. 1 of the
House of Representatives forthwith,
then and there to testify before said
committee or such commission as shall
be appointed touching such matters
then to be inquired of by said commit
tee In the contested election case of
Julius Kahn vs. Edward J. Livernash,
now before said committee for investi
gation and report; and that the Regis
trar of Voters for the city and county
of San Francisco bring with him all the
ballots and packages of ballots cast in
every precinct In the said Fourth Con
gressional District of California at the
general election held in said district
on the 4th day of November, 1902; that
said ballots be brought in the packages
In which the same now are; that said
ballots be examined and counted by or
under the authority of such Committee
on Elections in said case; and to that
end, that proper subp a be issued to
the sergeant at arms of this House,
commanding him to summons said
Registrar or his successor in office, if
any,~lo appear with such ballots as a
witness in said case; that service of
said subpena shall be deemed sufficient,
if made by registered letter, and such
service shall bo so made unless other
wise directed by said Committee on
Elections No. 1; and that the expenses
of said witness and all other expenses
under this resolution be paid out of the
contingent fund of the House; and that
said committee be, and hereby is, em

troversy; and also be, and It Is, em

or votes, and report the same to the
Committee on Elections No. 1 under
such regulations as shall be prescribed
for that purpose; and that the* afore
said expenses be paid on the requisition
of the chairman of said committee after
the auditing and allowance thereof by
said Elections Committee No. 1."
The resolution was adopted.
NEW REGISTRAR OP VOTERS.
There is gossip, in political circles to
the effect that a new Registrar of Vot
ers will be appointed on January 8.
Mayor Schmitz is not very communi
cative concerning his appointments to
the various* commissions of the city
government, but it Is generally conjec
tured ,that the new Registrar, if not a
straight-out Republican, will be a Un
ion Labor man of Republican tenden
cies. Eagan and Regan are said to be
on the Mayor's accepted list. Orator
Thomas Eagan, who taxed the vocabu
lary of flowery rhetoric in his speech
nominating Mayor Schmitz for a sec
ond term, is slated for the office of
Commissioner on the Board of Public
Works. It is reported that Mr. Regan
will be permitted to remain on the Po
lice Commission until the expiration
of the term for which Mr. Newhall
was appointed.
Any day news may come' from the
Governor's office announcing the ap
pointment of an adjutant general to
succeed George Stone, a Commis
sioner of Labor to succeed F. V. Mey
ers and a Prison Director to succeed
Robert M. Fitzgerald. .

IX TOURNASIEXT GAME
handicap Wonderly was given a week's
vacation on the ground for all but the
stable of Frank Regan. The rider is
under contract to the New York owner.
Tommy Burns piloted three winners.
His two finishes, the one on Kenilworth
and later when he landed Our Bessie
first, were the swellest pieces of horse
manshlp seen here this season.
The opening Futurity course sprint
was prolific of good things unfastened,
Romaine and Lady Bimbo being: the
hottest The first named, a gelding by
Brutus from Hazel D, and ridden by
Hildebrand, was backed from 20 down
to 7. Hildebrand got his mount away
well and after alternating with Lady
Bimbo In cutting out the pace beat
the mare easily at the wire. Hellas
ran third. Sir Preston, the favorite,
made a miserable showing.
BURNS' GREAT HORSEMANSHIP.
Tommy Burns put El Oriente, the
second choice, over the plate first for
the mile and seventy-yard selling num
ber, disposing of the favorite. Lunar,

made all the running and, although
Jack Martin rode a well judged race
on the first choice, he could not over
haul the pacemaker, Tommy furnish

work. Discus was beaten for the show
by Illowaho.
After the disaster to the favorite, Al
bemarle, In the fifth selection, a Fu
turity course sprint, Cardwellton, with
Otis in the saddle, grabbed first hon
ors. The De Arman entry receded in
the betting from 5 to 10 to 1, and ran in
a length and a half ahead of Oro Viva,
a 7 to 1 chance. Puss in Boots took the
show.
It looked as If the more money that
was bet on Our Bessie to win the con
cluding mile selling affair the higher
the price went. The price kept on soar
ing until 8 to 1 was touched, the Chlca
goites claiming the distance to be too
short for the Texas mare. As the bend
for home was reached, with Young
Pepper in front and Namtor running
second, it assuredly did not look bright
for the backers of Our Bessie. But un

It could scarcely fail to surprise any
body taking enough interest in the
matter to read the figures, to learn how
many persons gain a living and much
more by means of such government as
Tammany provides in New York. This
organization owes its vitality and
power solely tn the spoils which it dis- 
tributes. It is as distinctly an institu
tion of profit as any commercial or
speculative undertaking in New York
City. It is an agency for making
money, as definite and as openly con
fessed as any corporation in the land.
Tammany has Its imitators in many
other cities in the Unionâ Philadelphia,
St. Louis, Pittsburg, Cincinnati, , Min
neapolis, not to speak of a number of
lesser municipalities. So it is seen that
making money by holding up and rob
bing cities and investing them with
vicious rule has become an established
trade In a country that vaunts itself on
having the best government on earth.
In the light of the indorsement which
the chief city in the United States gave
to graft and boodling it is pertinent to
ask where this sort of thing is tc cease.
If the great municipality of New York,
which may be said to focus and cen
tralize the finest fruits of American
civilization, can yield itself to the sway
of venality and Immorality, with a full
knowledge of everything which that
surrender implies, what security
against like temptation and shameful
weakness can be hoped for in other
cities? What limit can be drawn on
a virus which has made the dangerous
headway which graft has developed in
this country?â Kansas City Star.
Business of Looting Cities.
Eddie Hanlon capitulated to Young
Corbett last night in the matter of a
referee for their contest on Tuesday
next after one hour twenty minutes of
diplomatic discussion.
For an hour the two boxers were
closeted in a room, the idea being that
if left to their own resources they
might come to an amicable understand
ing. At the end of an hour's discus
sion they were just where they started.
Young Corbett insisted upon Eddie
Graney being chosen, while Hanlon
would agree to any referee of known
ability other than Graney. Both agreed
to accept Harry Corbett if he would
act, but he positively refused to do so.
During the discussion the rival feather
weights-thrashed over their last fight
round by round, each ointing out
where he had an advantage and should
have received the decision.
When the boxers could not reach an
agreement Manager Morris Levy was
called In and the matter was all gone
over again. Corbett explained thit he
was a stranger in this city and that all
he wanted was a square deal. He said
Graney had a national reputation both
as a boxer and. a referee and the pres
ence of such a man in the ring meant
much to both of them. Of three other
men mentioned, he said Eddie Smith is
too easily influenced by the spectators,
while his objection to Jack Welch and
Phil Wand is that they are not boxers.
Hanlon came out flatfooted and said
he should have had the decision in the
last fight. This, and what he termed a
private reason, were what stood in the
way of his accepting Graney. The pri
vate reason Is presumed to be the fact
that Graney Is the uncle of Harry Fo
ley, Eddie's trainer. It has been
thought that Foley and Hanlon are re
lated, but such is not a fact.
Affairs hud reached an acute stage
when the gathering was about to break
up after a fruitless session. Corbett
turned to Morris Levy and said he
would be on hand on Tuesday night to
weigh In and would claim the club's
forfeit if the flght did not take place.
Hanlon then said he was fighting in his
home town and he knew he would not
get the worst of It, and he agreed to
accept Graney. His stand was such a
manly one that it aroused the admira
tion of those' present.
In a most paternal manner Young
Corbett said: "Little boy, I wouldn't
do anything in -the .world to'liarm you;
and I had no wrong motive in holding,
out for Graney. I think he is the best
man available." â¢
The boxers then separated. Young
Corbett taking the car out to the park.
He then walked through the park to
his quarters at the beach with, Billy
Otts.
Hanlon paid a brief visit to his moth
er and then returned to Alameda.
It was standing room only at the
quarters of both boxers yesterday, both
doing light work. A crush is expected
to-day. The advance sale of seats Is
exceptionally large. From present ap
pearances the attendance will exceed
that at the Corbett-McGovern fight,
when the gate amounted to $21,000.
There has been but little money wag
ered up to the present time. The pre
vailing odds are still 10 to 8, with Cor
bett favorite.

During the progress of the fifth race,
Albemarle, the favorite, ridden by
Foley, fell three furlongs from home
and the luckless rider was picked up
with a fractured collar bone. Bee
Rosewater fell over Albemarle, Bell,
her pilot, escaping injury.
Perhaps the severest facer encoun
tered by the talent was when Cascine.
the Burns & Waterhouse colt, a 1 to 2
favorite for the two-year-old sprint,
finished second. The winner turned up
in the good looking Dr. Rowell, a 13
to 1 shot, which made all the running
under Bell's clever handling and
downed the odds-on choice handily by
a neck. Tommy Burns, who rode the
favorite, said the colt propped under
him during the early pace, but the
youngster certainly stood for a long,
hard drive, or he would not have been
among the first three. Otto Stifel ran
third, two lengths before Lord Wads
worth.
AliBEMARLE IS DOWN.
Kenilworth regained some of hl3 fad
ing popularity and the big Saturday
crowd gave ,the brown horse quite a
reception after he had defeated a crack
cluster of flyers In the six and a half
furlong handicap yesterday at Ingle
side track.
Harry Stover's bird, -with Tommy
Burns on his back, was assigned 121
pounds and opened an 8 to 5 favorite.
Later, when a plunge was made on
Gold* Money, the Jennings entry, the
favorite's price went to 3. Only the
rough -work at the start by Wonderly
on San Nicholas prevented Gold Money
from winning by herself.
There was no lack of early pace, for
Burnle Bunton and San Nicholas went
away scorching. Kenilw\jrth hooked
up with the pair in the stretch. He
soon had the measure of San Nicholas,
but ridden out to the last ounce to beat
Gold Money, -which Jack Martin
brought on from a hopeless looking
target bearer, to lose by half a length.
Show honors went to San Nicholas.
Favorites had a rough siege of it
from the jump, horses quoted at all
sorts of curious figures catching the
eyes of the judges first. Kenilworth
was the only actual favorite to earn
brackets.

cer day or $10 per week.The great "Jim J." attended the
first day's recent mediation confer
ence at Butte wearing his nightshirt.
The president of the Northern Securi
ties is sometimes careless in matters
of dress, but this is said to be the
limit. He had planned that his spe
cial train en route to Butte would
pass Helena about 7 in the morning.
He had wired ahead to Governor
Toole to accompany him to Butte on
his special. Not wishing to get the
Governor out too early, Hill requested
the train crew to time the speed so as
not to reach Helena earlier than 7.
He desired also to be up when the
Governor climbed aboard. Like many
another man in more humble station
in life. Hill overslept and was not on
hand to greet , the Governor. The
train sped along by East Helena and
Montana (City, and still the great Se
curities man did not put in an ap
pearance. Finally one of Hill's sec
retaries, knocked at his stateroom and
called him, telling him the Governor
was not only aboard,, but breakfast
was awaiting him. The railroad pres
ident did a clever turn in quick dress
ing. In a few minutes he hurried into
the dining compartment, of the car,
greeted everybody pleasantly, inquired
about Governor Toole's health, praised
the beautiful October weather and
proposed that they eat breakfast.
Something about Hill's attire attract
ed the attention of those who had ac
companied him from St. Paul. His
shirt looked odd. Closer inspection
explained all. ' t
He had on his nightshirt. In his
haste he did not take it off. but sim
ply pulled a string tie around his neck
and let it go at that. Nor did he
change it when he reached Butte. He
walked up town wearing the unstarch
ed garment and wore it all day at
the conference.
Whether it was absent-mindedness
or expediency that made him wear a
nightshirt at the conference with two
Senators and the Governor will proba
bly never be known. The incident will
not be forgotten in a day and will
orobably cause James J. Hill to either
It is common gossip in St Paul that
the recent trip to Butte, Mont., by
James J. Hill in the private car that
was once the exclusive outfit of C. S.
Mellen when he was president of the
Northern Pacific was attended by
some unusual circumstances.
To begin with, that car had never
before been used by anybody except
Mellen. No subordinate of his had ever
set foot in it. Even Hill had never
been in it except on Mellen's invita
tion. But Hill ordered it fitted out
for the Butte trip without so much
as consulting President Elliott or let
ting him know that he was going to
use the car.

magnificent mustache in Breslau
grows on the upper lip of Herr Rott
ger. At a convivial gathering the oth
er evening he offered to cut it off if
the company would give $25 to a char
ity in which he was interested. He
was taken up, the contract was put in
writing and Rottger was to appear the
next evening "all shaven and shorn"
and get the money.
Rottger did not turn up. Instead
the postman brought a letter from
Frau Rottger, who said when she mar
ried her husband she also married his
mustache, adding:
"His mustache is my mustache. He
has no right to dispose of it and the
contract on paper is null and void.
Should you dispute this the law courts
are open to you."
The "party of the second part" in
the contract has accepted the wife's
challenge and taken legal steps to
compel Rottger to live up to his bar
gain.

"This time," he said, "the foolish

The Bullfighters' Grit.
The death of the â¢ famous Spanish
toreador Reverte recalls one of the
most thrilling incidents ever witnessed
in the arena. It was at Bayonne.
After disposing of two bulls Reverte
had twice plunged his swojd into a
third, of great strength and ferocity,
and as the beast continued careering
wildly the spectators began to hiss Re
verte for bungling. * Wounded to the
very quick of his pride, the Spaniard
shouted, "The bull is slain!" and,
throwing aside his sword, sank' on one
knee, with folded arms, in the middle
of the ring.
He was right, but he had not al
lowed for the margin of accident. The
wounded beast charged full upon him,
but the matador, splendid to the last,
knelt motionless as a statue, while the
bull literally bounded at him, and as
he sprang he sank in death, with his
last effort giving one fearful lunge of
the head that drove a horn into the
thigh of . the kneeling man and laid
bare the bone from the knee to the
joint Still Reverte never flinched, but
remained kneeling, exultant in victory,
but calmly contemptuous of applause,
till he was carried away to heal bis
wound. â London Globe.
A Defense of Slang.
So far from being an evidence of a
national levity and lack of seriousness,
slang is the language of sincerity. It

get as far away as possible from
everything like pretentiousness. It is
the antipodes of pathos. It is the lan

An Interesting Talk by Expert on the
Marvels of Fossilized
Kesins.
A joint meeting of the department
of . mineralogy, Brooklyn Institute,
and the New York Mineralogical Club
was held recently at the Art building.
George E. Ashby, president of the de
partment, led the conference on "Fos
sil Resins," the subject set for the
eveqing. Professor D. S. Martin read
a paper on "Geological Mineralogy,"
and Dr. Wallace Goold Levison, B. Sc,
led the discussion following, and ex
hibited a method of showing the ab
sorption bands of minerals in powder,
with the spectroscope. Mr. Ashby
exhibited a comprehensive collection
of amber and other fossil resins, and
other members of the department also
brought choice specimens. Some of
those shown were fossil copal from
Zanzibar, Africa, sometimes called
"gum animi," on account of the num
erous insects it contained (this gum
is characterized by a surface having
a peculiar goose flesh appearance);
other African copals from both the
East and the West Coast, and copals
from Brazil and other parts of South
America. Among the amber speci
mens shown were some associated
with lignite, or brown coal. Mr. Ash
by called special attention to a speci
men of amber from Hazen Island,
Greenland, in which the amber, "dis
tilled by pines that were dead before
the days of Adam," had filled cavities
in the brown coal made by boring
worms in the wood before it was
turned to coal.
In his address in leading the con
ference Mr. Ashby said that amber,
the oldest and most thoroughly fos
silized resin, was for ages a chief fac
tor in the intercourse of widely sep
arated peoples and a means of calling
new trade routes into being, thus 'ex
tending some of the arts of peace and
culture to distant and savage lantls.
Amber was a most important gem of
the ancient civilized world, and its
power of attracting light bodies when
rubbed early claimed the attention of
savants, who named It "electron," a
word from which our word electricity
is derived. The beauty and supposed
occult power of amber inspired the
imagination of savants and poets
alike to account for its origin.
After briefly rehearsing some of
these legends, Mr. Ashby stated that
amber had been derived from the
flora of the tertiary period, when Eu
rope was a great archipelago and lux
uriant forests extended into the polar
circle. While most of the amber of
the Baltic is of various shades of yel
low, sometimes running into b^own,
Roumanian amber is usually of a rich
dark brown hue, with shining gold
and silver flecks and bluish and green
ish tints, while the Sicilian variety
was said to possess all the colors of
the rainbow, but Its chief charm is
its fluorescence, a curious property
possessed by some bodies of giving off
reflected light of a color different
from their own. â Brooklyn Eagle.

GEM OF THE ANCIENTS
HELENA, Mont., Dec. 26. â In Mie
Isaac Gravelle case to-day the defen
dant occupied the stand all day. His
direct examination lasted about three
hours, arid when court adjourned he
was still under cross-examination.
Gravelle denied having been at any of
the places where dynamite was ex
ploded on the track, and said he was
never in Livingston, where the bridge
was Injured, and gave a detailed ac
count of his movements in August and
September, testifying that he was out
of town when the explosions took
place in the vicinity of Helena, about
150 miles from the scene. He denied
writing or forwarding any threatening
letters, denied conversations with wit
nesses who have testified to Gravelle's
confessions, and also denied having
sent any threatening letters out of the
jail. On cross-examination he stuck
closely to his story, and he has so far
avoided contradicting himself. The
only point brought out by the State
in his examination is that he' in his
numerous alleged trips in the north
ern part of the State did not meet nor
talk to any one who could substan
tiate his story of a visit to that sec
tion.

WALLA WALLA, Wash., Dec. 26.â
After a wild ride bareback over sage
brush and rocks in the rough Warm
Springs Canyon country, twenty-five
miles west- of here, "Doc" McMinn and
Frank Smith, two boy outlaws, were
captured last night by Deputy Sheriff
Keys and Allen Burns, a,Touchet cow
boy.
The youths, who are aged 18 and 17,
respectively, were located in a home
steader's cabin in the Hudson Bay dis
trict, a lonely, barren prairie section.
They sighted the officers, Jumped on
treir horses and fled. The deputies were
in a buggy, and. had to unhitch and
ride bareback for nine- miles. Shots
failed to stop the" boys until they were
cornered near the Walla Walla River.
Even then they tried to separate and
escape.
For weeks McMinn, his brother and
Smith have been living a species
of outlaw existence in a cabin north
west of here, occupying themselves
plundering neighboring cabins and
sheep camps. Th# escaped early in
the week from a-Prescott deputy. Then
CecU McMinn was caught, and the of
ficers had been trailing the others for
two days. .

and netted many easy balls. Of the
four MacGavin was by far the most
brilliant player, but tha superior
steadiness of his opponents easily off
set this.
Another excellent match was that in
which Harry Rolfe and Herbert
Schmidt beat Gus Taylor and Sidney
Salisbury. Taylor has not played for
a long time and was somewhat out of
practice, but played a clever game.
Rolfe and Schmidt are improving all
the time and their work of late has
been consistent. They won three sets
out of four.
A fast mixed doubles match waÂ«
played by Miss Ethel Smith and Leon
ard Wood on one side of the net and
Miss Alicia Mills and Herbert Gray on
the other. The four sets played were
close, but all of them were won by
Miss Smith and Wood, who were a
trifle too strong for their opponents.*
If possible the handicap doubles
tournament which was commenced on
Christmas day will be completed to
day. Play will be called at 9:30 this
morning. "\^
The following matches were played
yesterday:
Tennis players were so numerous at

How I Cure Weak, Puny Men
Give me a man broken down from excesses, dissipation, hard work, or worry, from any cause which
has sapped his vitality. Let him follow my advice for three months and I will make him as vigorous in every
respect as any man of his age.
I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never intended by nature to be strong and
sturdy. Even that man I can make better than he-is; but the man who has been strong and has lost his
strength I can make as good as he ever was. I can give back to any man what he has lost by abuse of the
laws of nature.
A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps badly, awakes more tired than when
he went to bed. who is easily discouraged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and
energy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt supplies.
The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you lose it in
any manner my Belt will replace it, and cure you.
757 Guerrero St.. Sin Francisco. Cal.
SB. McliATJGEtljIIT â Dear Six: Z suffered for several years from Inmbaaro and sreneral broken down fesllnsr. In
this condition It was hard to make my run as engineer on tne S. P. Ballroad. After uslnjr your Belt for two months
It entirely cured my aliments, and I've had no return of the pain slnco. Z feel far better than X have for years, and
shall always recommend your Belt, for it restored me to health. Tours truly, J. J. EOCKWELli.
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the
man who has become discouraged from useless doctoring. I cet such letters everyday.
My belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and stirs up
a great force of energy in a man.
I make the best electric body appliances in the world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting them. I
know my trade. My cures after everything else has failed are my best arguments.
HASEOE, Oresron.
OB. M.* C. McXAUGHMIT â Sear Sir: In reply to your last letter I will say that Z wore your Bait for 30 days and
in that time it entirely cured me of lame back and nervousness. .1 feel perfectly well now. better than Z have for 20
years, for which Z have your Belt to thank. Tours very truly, a. NELSON.
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints, "come and go" pains in his
shoulders, chest and side. Sciatica in Jus hip, Lumbago. Rheumatism or any ache or pain, and my Belt will
pour the oil of life into his aching body ahd drive out every sign of pain. No pain can exist where my Belt is
worn. * BE2TTOW, Cal.
SB. M. C. MCLAUGHLINâ D ear Sir: Z have only worn the Belt for six weeks and it has done fine in my case.
Every sign of pain and weakness has left my lesr and Z am as well as ever. ' Z was quite lame when Z first wrote you, but
am all over that now. Tours grratef ully, V . T. H. PIAOLEH.
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not
cures by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt.
Now, what does this mean to j'ou, dear reader? If you are not what you ought* to be. can you ask any
better proof to make you try it? Is there a remedy which is as simple, as easy to use. as sure to cure, and as
cheap as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must try it. In justice to yourself and
to those who look to you for their future happiness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not be
delayed.
It's as good for women as for men.- Worn while you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle,
glowing heat from it constantly, but no sting, no burning, as in old style belts.-
Call to-day, or send for my beautiful book, full of the things a man likes to read if he wants to be a
strong man. I send it sealed, free. Cut this out.

SAYS FAMILY
WAS IN PERIL
MRS. DUTTON'S
SISTER CHIEF
GUEST AT TEA
- "What the next move will be remains
a matter for speculation and the man
agers are beginning to want an ex
planation. The law, as It stands, will
affect a number of shows coming into
Portland and throughout the- State if
the Commissioners are correct in their
stand and refuse to make concessions.
"The Pollard Juvenile Opera Company
of Australia, which has filled several
engagements during the past three
years, will be affected seriously, unless
some loophole if discovered. This com
pany has been booked by Manager
George L. Baker for Portland.the com
pany coming to that city after complet
ing a tour in California, where the or
ganization is at present. In a less de
gree, it will interfere with Mr. Stod
dard in 'The Bonnie Brier Bush,' at
the Marquam Grand, to say nothing of
several rural dramas on the road to the
Pacific Coast, and the numberless
'Uncle Tom' shows. The latter may
escape, however, as 'Little Eva' is gen
erally supposed to be somewhere near
fifty years old.
"The case of the Pollards, however,
is particularly interesting, as It may in
volve international law and treaty
rights to some extent. Manager Baker
says that he does not know what he
will do yet in the premises. He is will
ing to obey the law, and if the play
goers of Portland do not want to see
the Australian children, then he is will
ing to cancel the contract. In the event
c-f a demand, the manager will prob
ably have the rights of the Pollards in
vestigated by lawyers. While the ques
tion involved is very hazy at the pres
ent time, it is believed that the Pollards
are protected by treaty, and as for the
Eastern companies, the Labor Commis
sioners cannot interfere -with them
without violating interstate laws.
"It was not the intention of the Leg
islature to have the law obstruct the
theatrical business, but under the con
struction of the law given by the Labor
Commissioners, the theaters are about
the only place where the Commission
ers are seeking for violations.
"Should the labor commission be cor
rect in their stand, it will compel many
theatrical companies to leave Oregon
entirely out of their itinerary."
George L. Baker of the Baker Thea
ter in Portland, Oregon, sends the fol
lowing interesting item of Oregon law:
"Children are not permitted to par
ticipate in any theatrical erftertainment
in Oregon," owing to the child labor law,
which was enacted at the legislative
session last winter and but recently be ;
came operative. The attention of local
managers was brought to the law, when
they received notice to discharge their
programme boys and the boys who dis
tribute water. This was complied with
by the managers of the Marquam
Grand, the Baker, the Empire and Cor
dray's theaters. But the Commission
ers did not stop there. "When 'Ben
Hur' arrived they ordered the dis
charge of a dozen youngsters, who- were
assisting In making a stage picture.
The next step was the removal of ju
venile performers from the vaudeville
houses. :. â¢.
For years no independent dramatic
attraction has been able tb appear in
Detroit, owing to the control of the
first-class theaters in that city by the
theatrical syndicate. A similar condi
tion has existed in Cleveland. The
theatrical monopoly in these cities will
be broken by Mrs. Fiske, who, New
Year's week, will nil an engagement
at the Avenue Theater, in Detroit, and
shortly after will appear at the New
Colonial Theater in Cleveland. Mrs.
Fiske will be the first of several at
tractions to appear this season at the
theaters in question that have been
booked by the Independent Booking
Agency. Mrs. Fiske has not played in

Children From the
Stage in Portland
* *
stage is like all other arts â there is
always room at; the top. One does not
have to Â¦wait for a vacancy in the
ranks for advancement. For painters,
writers, singers and actors, t advance
comes to those who are deserving and
this does not hinge upon the will of
some petty employer. Even if the dra
matic schools are grinding out actors
by the dozens to-day, I would not dis
courage any one, who I thought has
ability to enter the profession. Good
actors are scarce enough and the stage
will not be hurt by the addition of a
number of bad actors if a few good
actors can be given it. To a girl who
loves her work and realizes its serious
ness, I would say, by all means, go
ahead. But to. the Voung woman who
looks on the stage as a sort of a frolic
through life and an easy way of gain
ing the admiration that she craves, I
should say keep away from it. In
ninety-nine cases out of one hundred
success on the stage is the result of
hard work. In no profession or business
calling is the work so hard or trying,
and the young person who contem
plates making a step in this profes
sion should realize that she is about
to enter a profession in which tha
hardships, disappointments, work and
triumphs â if they should finally come,
âare greater than in any other walk
of life I can recall."
Matter Wltli British Industry.
Sir Norman Lockyer has declared
before the British Association that
-the cause of British decline is the
fault of the educational system." It
Is said that at a meeting of the as
sociation next year he intends to prove
by means of the statistics of British
industries that the national life is suf-
"Ladies and Gentlemen â I knew the
play was good and I felt that you
would like the company; the only per
son I had any doubt about was my
self, and if you like me, I am the hap
piest woman in New York." :
Thus spoke Henrietta Crosman, the
most envied of actresses to-day, at the
first performance of "Sweet Kitty Bel
lairs," in New York, at the Belasco
Theater recently. In her modesty
Miss Crosman was honest, as can
be discovered by any one lucky
enough to get a few minutes' con
versation with her. In working 1 out
a successful career for herself this
actress has had to combat her , own
lack of confidence as well as the hard
ships that confront success in all
walks of life. Yet, probably no story
of final triumph in a chosen career is
more interesting than this same Hen
rietta Crosman's.
"I went on the stage," says she, "be
cause I had to earn my living. There
was no love for the stage then. Only
a desire to be able to help myself and
my family. Ambition came afterward
and my regret is that I am only such
a little way on my journey. Any suc
cess that the public may be good
enough to say I have attained has
been accomplished by hard work and
disappointment.
"Like most every one else, my start
was made in one of the smaller com
panies and after a year or so I got into
New York. Then I went to Daly's and
then to the Lyceum. I thought I had
made Â¦ a name for myself when I
played 'Glorlana,' but when that play
was withdrawn I found that I could
not get an engagement.
"But what, at that time, seemed to
me the hardest blow of my career was
really my salvation, for unable to ob
tain work, I was compelled to accept
engagements in stock. Naturally, I
said to myself, 'If you were a good
actress, Henrietta Crosman, they
would want you in New York, but be
ing a bad actress, you must play twice
a day.' , ;
. "I didn't realize that that same
twice a day and a long part each
week to study was the very experi
ence that I needed. I only looked* at
the hardship of it all then and com
plained at my lot. Stock experience
and the opportunity to play the great
roles gave me great experience, such
as I could have got no other way,
and now I am the most thankful of
women that the fates .decreed that I
could not get even one manager to
give me a part on Broadway.
VI am hoping that my experience
and the work I have 'done will help
some other poor woman to bear the
burden that she is carrying until such
time as the fates decree otherwise. If
she will only say to herself that it per
haps is all for. the best, that will help
to bear her up.
"Yet with it all, knowing. the work
and disappointments that must come,
were some young woman to ask my
advice about going on the stage I
should say, 'Do so by aft means; that is,
provided you are sure that you have
some talent, a good constitution and
an ability to perform an immense
amount of hard work.' The opportuni
tines offered to a young woman In the
dramatic profession are more, I think,
than in any other. -There is always
room at the top, and I presume that
every young woman who goes on the
stage has an ambition to become a
star. To. a young woman who has
talent and is not difficult to discover
my advice would be to adopt the pro
fession of the stage. When one looks
at the myriad of young girls who are
working in stores, offices and other
places, earning a mere i pittance 1 and
with no opportunity of* advancement
beyond a certain limit,' one cannot
help but see the advantage of the
stage as a profession if the applicant
Is suited in temperament, constituÂ»
tion and all else"* or her work. The
The Christmas number of The
Theater Magazine is one of the most
sumptuous of all the holiday publica
tions. With the present number, this
Interesting monthly, may be said to
have reached the high-water mark of
theatrical .'magazine making. The
number ia double the usual size, 'mak
ing a superbly Illustrated book of
some sixty pages, and it contains over
a .hundred half-tone plates in addition
to two extra supplements, litho
graphed in twelve colors, showing re
spectively Edwin Booth as Richelieu
and Mary Anderson as Hermlone. The
artistic colored, cover, a thing of
beauty in green and gold, shows Viola
Allen as Viola in "Twelfth Night."
The reading matter is excellent and in
cludes . special contributions from
famous writers. Bronson Howard,
the dean of American dramatists, s-;nris
a greeting, congratulating*The Thea
ter on having reached its third Christ
mas, and Justin Huntly McCarthy
contributes a graceful bit of . verse.
Clara^ Morris defends the modern
drama from the charge of degenera
tion, and Ada Patterson gives us an
insight into the real personality of
Julia Marlowe. The home life of the
great Italian actor Salvini is described
by his daughter-in-law, who is an
American actress, and there is a re
production of a rare theatrical curio
â the playbill announcing the first ap
pearance in Washington of John
Wilkes Booth. The Paris Conserva
toire and its system Is interestingly
described by Henry Tyrrell, and Mrs.
Otis Skinner gives a charming little
account of gypsy players in France.
Aubrey Lanston contributes another
of his gracefully written papers on
eighteenth century players, and in the
way of fiction there is- a clever story
of stage life by Edward Lissner. W. J.
Henderson discusses Patti's latest
"farewell," and other musical events
with his usual authority. In this
issue, too, the result is announced of
The Theater's prize play competition,
in which three hundred plays were
submitted. The winning play is en
titled "The Triumph of Love." The
identity of the author will be disclosed
next month. An exceptionally inter
esting double page feature is a num
ber of scenes from old plays, showing
the early stage beginnings of stars
now famous. The pictures include,
besides the colored plates above men
tioned, full page pictures of Otis Skin
ner, Fritz! Scheff, Evelyn Florence
Nesbitt, Marguerite Clarke, Lottie
Faust, Rose Clark, Slgnora Varasi,
Mme. Gadski, scenes "from "Twelfth
Night," "Major Andre," "John Ermine

ADVXB.TISEMLENTS.It is in fact a grave sanitary ques
tion whether the handkerchief does
not do more harm than good, as it is
ordinarily used. When we assume that
the healthy nose does not need to be
wiped, we face a reasonably broad
proposition as to the danger of the
handkerchief as a disease propagator.
Most nasal catarrhs are of an infec
tious character, notably those of grip
origin.
Contrary to a general law of asepsis
the handkerchief saturated with dis
ease germs, instead of being promptly
washed, is stowed for hours in the
pocket, with a result that can be easily
imagined. Is it any wonder then that
catarrhs are constantly fostered by a
system of auto infection ? â Medical
Record.

Although the Pope never travels he
owns a sleeping car, which was con
structed in 186S, when the line from
Rome to Naples was opened. It will
be exhibited at the Milan exhibition
in 1905 to inaugurate the Simpson
tunnel. There are three compart
ments â a throneroom, a car for the
guard of honor and a bedroom. The
throneroom is richly furnished and
has a cupola engraved with the papal
arms and the twelve -apostles. The
carriage is so arranged that the Pope
when seated on his throne is plainly
visible and can give his benediction
to the crowds at the stations. The
sleeping car is divided into three parts
â bed, bath and dressing rooms â
which are hung with yellow and
white, papal colors. The bed is of
ebony and ivory; â Washington Star.

A society has been organized in Phil
adelphia for supplying popr people with
ice, coal, milk and other necessities at
the lowest possible rates. What nobler
work could a religious society be en
gaged in? asks the Boston Globe.
One of the ladies of this society no
ticed that children on their way to
school are almost barricaded by candy
merchants, who sell them large quanti
ties of colored candies, which the doc
tors are ever declaring to be most dele
terious to the health of young people,
besides furnishing a fruitful means of
wasting their pennies.
The society thereupon got permission
to use the schoolhouse basementl There
they established tables and covered
them with clean white cloths and glis
tening plates and glasses.
Now for one penny the school chil
dren of Philadelphia may have a glass
of sterilized milk, or bread and butter,
or fresh pretzels, or graham crackers.
For the same price may be'ha"d apples,
bananas, pears, x peaches and other
fruits in their season. Plain cakes are
also furnished, but the harmful candy
habit is baried ou,t completely, except
some plain molasses species.
Of course, the society is a benevolent
one and no profit is expected. But it fur
nishes children a wholesome luncheon
for one cent, saves their tender stom
achs from destruction, teaches them to
care, for their pennies and is in every
way beneficial. The idea is worth fol
lowing in other cities.
Children of the Poor Furnished With
Good Luncheon at Cost of

A XOBLE WORK BEGUN
BY QUAKER CITY WOMAN'
Mrs. Timothy J. Crowley, a promi
nent member of the Ladies' Auxiliary
to California Commandery, K. T., re
cently entertained the ladies of that'or
ganization at a luncheon in one of the
swell rotlsseries and was assisted in
that function by Mrs. William Roderick
Jones, president of the auxiliary. The
table was set in the form of a horse
shoe and was most artistically decorat
ed with smilax, La . France roses and
carnations, with fairy lights in silver
holders. It was a full dress affair, the
ladies appearing moat charming, each
in the latest ideas of modistes. The
hostess was attired in a beautiful
gown of white crepe, silk and lace and
wore diamonds and pearls as orna
ments. During the repast, an excellent
one, a concealed orchestra made music.
There was a pleasing speech of wel
come by the hostess and a response by
Miss Mary J. Bragg, the secretary,
after which all the ladies sang an im
provised song to the hostess. Dtiring
the repast the husband of the hostess,
by special favor, was permitted to join
the party, and after his health had
been proposed and drunk he made a
neat little speech and made his escape,
not feeling as much at home among so
many ladies as he would at a session
of the Shriners. Then followed speeches
by the president, by Mrs. S. A. Mc-
Donnell. Mrs. Val Schmidt, Mrs. E. P.
Heald, Mrs. George Haas, Mrs. Lizzie
Atwood and Mrs. J. F. Logan. There
were fifty-five ladies present, and the
affair was .voted one of the most enjoy
able of the many functions given in the
name of the auxiliary.

The Ladies' Auxiliary of the National
Union, of which Mrs. D. Oliver is the

goodly number of members and as soon
as arrangements are completed the
members of the assembly will assist*
the local councils of the parent order
in their social functions.
The ball given by Pacific Council in

dances to excellent music. Arthur S.

It is related of the late Lord Salis
bury that he had as much disregard
for clothes as had his political rival,
the late Mr. Gladstone; and It is said
that both statesmen frequently
shocked their admirers and associates
by the shabbiness of their sartorial
outfits. Â»
President Roosevelt often betrays
similar indifference in this respect. In
his days of ranch life his "togs** were
such as ordinary cowboys wear; and
during the last Presidential contest,
when he was, campaigning in the West,
he wore a slouch hat that was of so
ancient a Vintage and of appearance"
so generally disreputable that Senator
Hanna, it is said, felt called on to re
monstrate with him about the matter.

Recent mention of the dlsappearar.^
of the $2 50 gold piece from circulation
and the premium this coin commands
as a curio has set many to rummaging
in old pocketbooka and bottoms of cash
boxes and drawers In search of odd or
out of date coins. Some have found a
52 50 piece, but not many. The (3 piece,
once quite common but always a sort
i of curiosity. Is oftener found, and many
] have specimens of the little gold coins
representing 23 cents ; and 50 cents,
1 which were not minted by the Govern
ment and probably have not as much
gold in them as they represent. â¢ ,-/Â¦
They used to pass as coin, but were
never in general circulation, being so
easily lost that they soon became
scarce. One of the handsomest coin
relics seen Is a $10 gold piece bearing
the mint stap of 1793. It is larger
than the present $10 piece. The owner
has it hung in a band and wears it as
a charm on his watch chain. The
owner says he refused an offer of $150
for thia relic. The old octagonal $50
pieces were quite common in Califor
nia in early days, when gold dust was
largely used as a circulating medium.
They were made of pure gold, and,
while they had not the elegant finish
of the gold coins minted by the Gov
ernment in these days, many still ro
member them as the handsomest > jj i
they ever saw. Many people no*/
would consider them handsome on ac
count of the $50 in them.â New York

King Rameses, the part taken by

a member of the Nile Club, and came
from Sacramento to read a paper at

The second part was an Egyptian

treated his subject with some serious

jolly reception by his old club mem

But it was with the second part that
the fun and originality made its ap

A quartet composed of Clarence
Crowell, Abe Leach, Dr. Raynes and
Charles Boice appeared upon the cor

sang a little song. Charles Anthony
Doyle then appeared, and the five dis

The new Royal College at Posen was
opened November 4 by Herr Studt. the
Minister- of Education, in the presence
of a distinguished company, including
Herr Conrad, who represented Count
von Bulow, General von Stulpnagel,
commanding the district; the rectors
of the Berlin University and of the
Technical College at Charlottenburg,
and the representatives of numerous
local corporations. The Minister of
Education, in declaring the building
open, referred to the Emperor's deep
Interest in the education of Eastern
Germany, to which the new college
largely owed its existence. Herr Studt
said that the new foundation was to
be a university in the true sense, for it
would serve the needs of all the popu
lation, Including even that section of
the Poles which still held aloof. Herr
Studt concluded by urging the neces
sity for the spread of German culture.
After the new rector. Professor
Kuhnemann, had dwelt upon the mer
its of the philosopher Kant and the
"national" importance of learning,
Herr Conrad, the representative of the
Imperial Chancellor, ascended the
platform. Herr Conrad's speech was
naturally of a somewhat political
character. He reminded the audience
of Count von Bulow's speech of Jan
uary, 1902, in the Reichstag, In which
the Imperial Chancellor had described
the economic necessities of the eastern
provinces. But the Chancellor, Herr
Conr"ad said, also knew that where art
and learning were absent the German
element suffered. Eastern Germany
was particularly ill-provided in this re
spect, and therefore Count von Bulow
heartily welcomed the new college.
The German had been thirsting for ed
ucation, learning and research, but the
sunlight of a happier future was al
ready dawning in the "East." This
college, added to others already exist
ing at Danzig and at Bromberg and to
the Emperor William Library at Po
sen, was an earnest of the Intentions
of the Government In spite of great
difficulties the new building had been
successfully completed, and the Im
perial Chancellor wished to congratu
late Posen. "But at the same time,"
Herr Conrad added, "the Chancellor
has charged me earnestly to exhort the
town and the province of Posen to
guard and treasure and make diligent
use of this great blessing which has
come into their midst."
The rectors of Berlin University, of
the. Charlottenburg Technical College,
and of Breslau University also deliv
ered speeches, and the proceedings
ended with cheers for the Emperor. â

Death stole Into a lonely cabin In
Woolsey Canyon on Christmas day and
bore away Mrs. Ella Walton Reed Wil
son. If she had any regret at going
it was for the tlyee young children she
was about to leave motherless â not for
herself.
Mrs. Wilson's is a sad story. Her
husband, Charles R. Wilson, is a porter
in San Francisco, with hours so bur
densome that he is seldom able to see
his family. Even while his wife lay
dying he was unable to come to her.
She struggled against her malady, con
sumption, to care for her children. Two
of them died recently from the same
dread disease that brought her relief
at last.
But for Captain Newton H. Chltten
den, the explorer and lecturer, Mrs.
Wilson would have died alone. He had
prepared to go on a trip abroad, but
upon learning of the" illness of his
neighbor put off the day of his depar
ture until the end came, knowing that
it would not be long to wait. In the
meantime he gave the suffering woman
food and medicine and made her last
hours comfortable. He also cared for
the children.
The funeral of Mrs. Wilson will be
held at 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon
from St. Mark's Church.

Richard Sibrlan. 13 years old, resid
ing at 1524 Oak street, Alameda, was
found dead- at 6 o'clock this morning
In a cell at the City Prison, where ho
had been taken at 8:30 o'clock last
night apparently In a stupor from ex
cessive drinking. A fracture of the
skull caused by a fall before Sibrian
was arrested Induced a slow hemor
rhage that brought death to the pris
oners' His actual condition was not dis
covered until after his body had been
examined at the Morgue by Health Offi
cer Dr. E. A. von Adelung.
Sibrian had been drinking yesterday
and about 7 o'clock last evening fell
down a sidewalk stairway at Christen
sen's saloon, southeast corner of Sev
enth and "Washington streets. Soon
afterward the young man, who showed
signs of liquor, was taken in the police
patrol wagon to the Receiving Hospital
by Patrolman Forgie to be treated for
a broken finger. At that time appar
ently the Injury to the head had not
manifested itself. Steward Harry Bor
chert set ihe fractured finger and the
sufferer was discharged.
According to Borchert and Policeman
Forgie, the patient exhibited no unus
ual symptoms. There was nothing
about his condition to attract special
attention. But because he seemed to
be slightly under the Influence of liquor
Borchert advised his patient to â¢ go
home. Sibrian said he had no money,
po Borchert gave him a dime and sent
him on hu way, expecting the younff
man would take a car for^ Alameda.
Sibrian did not go home. Within an
hour after he left the hospital Police
men Bert Brown and John Cockerton
saw him leaning against a piano box
at the southeast corner of Broadway
and Thirteenth streets. He was In a^
stupor and to nil outward appearances
was suffering from a heavy overindul
gence In Christmas beverages.
Sibrian was taken to th3 City Prison,
there registered as "drunk" by Jailer
Henderson and put in the cell in which
he died.
When Jailer Flynn was making hi^
rounds at 6 o'clock thl3 morning James
Flood, who occupied the cell with Si
brian. notified Flynn that the younjr
man was dead. Health Officer von
Adelung was called at once, but could
only pronounce the man dead.
The body was removed to the
Morgue, where an autopsy revealed th<*
fatal fracture on the right side of the
head, extending from the par to the
base of the brain. It was a break such
as might have been caused by a fall.
Police investigation uncovered th.3
facts concerning Slbrlan'a fall, and it
is .believed his skull was injured at tha
same time his finger was broken.
The fracture was of such a nature
that it was practically impossible to
discover it by external examination.
There was no depression of the skull
and no external hemorrhage to slve
warning of the fatal injury. Coroner
Mehrmann will hold an inquest Tues
day evening. In anticipation of that
inquiry, an independent pollct Investi
gation will be made concerning tho ,
facts surrounding the case. Sibrian'
leaves parents, a sister and a brother
residing In Alameda.

HEAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 26.
What is believed to be one of the
boldest assaults ever attempted on the
treasury of Alameda County has been
uncovered by County Auditor Bacon.
He has "held up" the claim of C. S.
MacMullan. allowed by the Board of
Supervisors, for $1099 15 for the alleged
discovery of unassessed taxable prop
erty, which was intended to be the
forerunner of claims that will aggre
gate $32,000. MacMullan says he has a
contract with the Supervisors for the
discovery of unassessed property which
should net him this amount.
When the news of the scheme became
noised about in the Inner circles of
courthouse officials a smile as deep as
a well and wide as a church door spread
Itself over the face of the entire official
family. The District Attorney has been
appealed to by AucUtor Bacon to see If
It is not possible to avoid payment to
MacMullan.
The plan of action dates back to
April 20 last, when the Board of Super
visors by a resolution gave MacMullan
a contract to expert the assessment
rolls of Alameda County and search for
assessable property that had been over
looked. By resolution he was to re
ceive 50 per cent of all taxes collected
on property he should discover that had
not been assessed within the last three
years.
ASSESSMENT ROLL SWELLED.
When Assessor Dalton made up the
assessment rolls he paraded the fact
that he had raised the assessment of
Alameda County about 512,000.000, a
large part of which was upon property
that had never been taxed. Then came
the raise of 20 per cent by the State
Board of Equalization on top of Dal
ton's raise, and MacMullan sat and
watched his expected profits grow.
McMullan claims he has discovered
55,000,000 worth of assessable property
that has not been assessed in the last
three years. At the rate of $1 37 on the
5100 this amounts to something like
$64,000, of which his share is a half, or
$32,000, for the season's work.
It was only when MacMullan's first
bill for services rendered was presented
that the possibilities of the proposition
became apparent. His first Item was
$616 50 for half the taxes on the fran
chise of the Oakland Gas, Light and
Heat Company In Berkeley. The fran
chise had never been taxed, and was
put upon the assessment rolls this year
for $90,000 and the taxes paid. His sec
ond item was for $421 for half the taxes
on the franchise of the Oakland Gas,
Light and Heat Company for Alameda,
assessed this year for the flrst time for
$00,000. His third Item was for half the
taxes on the property of the California
Jockey Club's racetrack at Emeryville,
$61 65. The property was assessed at
$18,000, and only the flrst Installment
has been paid.
ALL DUE TO MacMULLAX.
The enormous raise In th* assessment
of the county, it was discovered, was
due to the efforts of MacMullan. The
franchise of the Southern Pacific Com
pany for its ferry-boats, the water con
tained in the reservoirs of the Contra
Costa "Water Company, the electric
plant of the Southern Pacific and its
block system of switching had all been
overlooked and found by MacMullan.
The Board of Supervisors allowed
MacMullan's flrst claim in accordance
with its agreement, but Bacon says he
will not audit it until he. is forced to
do so.
MacMullan defends his position by
stating that the county has benefited
as much as he. In this connection he
said: "I have known about these as
sessments for a long time and have
only been waiting for a favorable
Board of Supervisors to get In right. I
told them when we made the agree
ment that I might make more than
they expected, but they ca1d the more
I would make the better they would
like it, for the county would then be
Just that much ahead, too. I consider
I have found about $5,000,000 worth of
property that has gone unassessed.
"I had good legal advice before I
went Into this and the District Attorney
told me himself that there was no
question but the Board of -Super
visors had the right to employ a man

Southern Negro Dialects.
A patron of cakewalks cr an admirer
of cakewalk music might be justified In
not thinking so, but the fact is that
there are more thp.n fifty separate dia
lects among the colored population of
.the South. Any one who has traveled
through the tidewater counties of Vir
ginia Is aware that t>"! cpeech of the
negro population there differs material
ly from that used in the cjtton fields
of Alabama. The sing-song speech of
the camp-meeting negro from the hilly
part of Northern Georgia differs essen
tially from the softer and more melodi
ous speech of the Louisiana negroes
from the region of the canebrakes and
rice fields.
The negro race in the South is es
sentially imitative, and in Louisiana,
where the reminders of French occupa
tion are many, the French "accent and
intonation are preserved. In South
Carolina, which has, relatively, the
largest negro population, there 'are
found in the tidewater counties the
Guinea negroes whose dialect it has
been found difficult for many visitors
to understand. In southern and south
western Missouri the negro dialect dif
fers entirely from what it is elsewhere
in the South, and in the Indian Terri
tory, where there is a considerable
negro population, many Indian phrases
and Indian methods of speech have be
come Incorporated In the speech of the
colored population. â N. T. Sun. i

OAKLAND, Dec. 26.â The opening
Jinks of the Nile Club to-night was one
of the most enjoyable functions of the
year. Two hundred members of the
swagger organization gathered at the
new clubrooms and made merry dur
ing the evening and far into the hours
of the morning.
The affair was a decided success. All
the members are elated over it and
clubmen who have taken part in so
cial functions of Oakland for years say
that the Nile Club's little feast was one
of the happiest they have yet enjoyed.
The members of the Nile Club assert
that theirs is a club that is entirely
different from any other in the coun
try and all are proud of its originality.
It Is composed mostly of the younger
element of Oakland's prominent men of
affairs and the directors have always
striven to conduct it in a modest way.
"When the clubrooms were destroyed
by fire some time ago the directors de
termined to secure other quarters and
finally interested well known capital
ists of this city and San Francisco In
the venture. Judge Melvin, George
Jackson, Frank Mott, Clarence Crowell
and C. J. Heeseman were chosen as
a board of managers, and it Is mainly
through their efforts that the>new club
rooms have been so well fitted up.
Everything in the new abode is de
cidedly Egyptian. Lotusy flowers are
used for floral decorations in all the
six rooms and Egyptian figures and
statues are to be found ~n^ the side
boards and mantels.
SUX IN" DECORATIONS.
The walla are hung with Egyptian
colors and on the ceilings are portrayed
in re*lief scenes of the rising and set
ting sun as Old Sol appears Just peep
ing over the edge of the desert. The
sphinx plays but a minor part in the
scheme of decoration and the pyramids
show here and there. It' was thought
that these two figures were rather com
mon, and so the rooms have been fin
ished after the style or decoration of
the Egyptian temples.
The great fireplace at the end of the
reading-room is one of the charms of
the place. Even this is Egyptian in de
sign and the great pillars at the sides
give It the appearance of the entrance
to a temple of thousands of years ago.
The Jinksroom has a stage that lacks
two feet In depth of being as big as
Fischer's stage in San Francisco, for
the Nile Club is strong on jinks and
they want room for their work. The
room seats just the number to which
the membership has been limited, 200,
for outsiders will not be permitted at
these â¢ entertainments, j There are a
number of set "scenes and a drop cur
tain of deep blue, studded with golden
stars, upon one corner of which is de
picted an immense peacock. The room
represents night and the stars blink
down from the celling.
JINKS ARE UXIQUE.
The jinks to-night that dedicated thia
club home were just as unique as the
decorations. There are a large num
ber of talented entertainers connected
with the Nile Club, and all of the work
was done by members.
There were two parts, as is tradition
ary with club affairsâ the high and low

A Personable Poet.
Joe Lincoln, the poet of Cape Cod.
though lacking considerably of being
eligible to the Fat Men's Club, could
not, on the other hand, pass himself
off as brother to the living skeleton.
A lady who met him for the first time
the other day said:
"Mr. Lincoln, I have always greatly
admired your poetry, but you are not,
I confess, just my idea of a poet. I
thought all poets were thin and wore
their hair long."
"Madam," returned Mr. Lincoln In a
burst of confidence, "If I depended
wholly on poetry I should fit your idea
precisely. But I write a story occa
sionally and so manage to get enough
to eat and to have my hair cut when
it needs it." â Philadelphia Post.

qu:Â»-enients. The Oregon steamer brought down
...<>. cacks, which had not been unloaded up to
a late hour. A car of Sweets came in. and as
the ct?r.k wa* not up to the usual standard
prices were lower. Onions were firm and un
changed.
Trade in vegetables was quiet and the re
ceipts, while light, were more than sufficient

prices, but nearly all the other descriptions

of Wax Bear.s were generally of poor quality

overstocked with Tomatoes and the top quota

Policeman's Beat Forty Miles.
If Policeman J. J. Mclntosh of the
Atrill-street police station, Chicago,
should start out in pedestrian costume
and with pedestrian equipment, in
cluding a shelter tent and some cook
ing utensils, he might be able to get
over his beat in three days â he thinks,
says the Chicago Tribune. If he were
given a horse and buggy he might
cover it in a day and a half without
injury to the horse. But In either
case he would be too busily engaged
in getting over the ground to stop and
attend to any police business. If he
had to pull all the boxes on the way
it might take half a day longer. If
he had to make many arrests it might
take a week. All these things were
explained to the police trial board,
and because of them a charge against
the policeman was dismissed. A
frame building had been erected at
1653 North Kedzie avenue without a
building permit and the city officials
were endeavoring to have the police
men of the thirty-flfth precinct held
responsible for it. Mclntosh proved
conclusively that he could not be held
accountable for everything that might
happen on his beat, because there was
too much of it. He had prepared a
map of the section of the city about
Kedzie avenue and Milwaukee ave
nue supporting his contention. Forty
miles of streets have Mclntosh for
their guardian. â Pittsburg Press.

In the proper care of the ears In
childhood two things have to be con
sidered â the local conditions of the
ears, and, what Is equally Important,
the general state of the childTa health.
As to the care of the ear itself, it must
always be remembered that the hear
ing apparatus Is a piece of very deli
cate mechanism, no more suited to
rough treatment than is the ball of the
eye. It can be easily Injured by the
Introduction of a foreign body, or by
a blow from the outside. Small chiKl
ren sometimes push things into their
ears by way of experiment. In this
case the child's guardians should keep
perfectly cool and send for a physi
cian at once. The child must not be
shaken and punished until the object
is removed, and above all the nurse
or mother must not grope for it with
hairpin or tweezers, for that is the
way to push it farther in. or to wound
or even rupture the delicate drum
membraneâ an accident which may
be followed by complete deafness, and
even death, should a serious inflamma
tion ensue. *
There is perhaps one exception to
this rule of leaving a foreign body
alone until the doctor comes. Occa
sionally insects into the ear, and
cause great aifgulsh by buzzing and
fluttering about/ They can be speedily
disposed of by dropping in a little
sweet oil or lukewarm sale water.
As to injury from the outside, chil
dren should be carefully guarded
against any games which Include loud
shoutings directly Into the ear, and it
is surely needless to add that pulling
the ears and, above all, boxing: the
cars as a form of punishment should
be held a criminal offense. It may In
duce partial and temporary deafness,
complete deafness and even death, and
if indulsed in by a teacher should be
followed by arrest and public rebuke.

â¢Macedonian patriots make much
complaint of the atrocities perpetrated
by the Turks. #Y band of Bulgarian

"Â¦Recent advices from the coast relatlva to

Notice to Mariners.
The following notice to mariners has been 1s
aued from the, branch United States Hydro
graphic Office:
Captain Edward England of the British ship
Thistle reports to the Branch Hydrographio
Office that on October 19, 1003, In latitude
south 03 degrees 53 minutes, longitude west 177
degrees 37 minutes, his vessel passed over what
he thinks is shoal water.
Â¦ The captain came on deck at 9 a. m. and Im
mediately noticed discolored water, like pass
ing over coral bottom, extending a considerable
distance astern and for a ship's length ahead
and on each side. The ship passed at once Into
deep blue water. There was no time to take
soundings. Wind was strong, east southeast.
High northeast swell, but no heavy breaks
could be seen anywhere. Weather cloudy, hori
zon clear. Good sights for longitude had just
been taken, and good noon sight for latitude
was also obtained. Chronometers were found
to be correct upon making Washington Inland,
November 23. J. C. BURNETT.
Lieutenant, U. S. N., In Charge.
One dav last week a United States
silver dollar. now ( in its ninety-ninth
year, began its long Journey from Den
ver, Colo., to Portland, Or., after hav
ing lain in a Denver coin collection for
more than eighteen years. Though the
dollar is about the size of those coined
during the present year and contains
about the same number of grains of
silver, it brought in the neighborhood
of about $5 35 per' grain of pure silver
in its combination, and all this because
it has been in the one form for nearly
100 years.
This dollar is one of the coinage of
1804, of which there are only , seven
known to be in existence. It was
bought by the late J. V. Dexter at the
Chapman sale of coins in 1885. At that
time the coin had been but lately se
cured from a collection in Berlin, being
the only one of the dollars that Is
known to have been in a foreign col
lection. Mr. Dexter paid $1000 for the
dollar, having to bid against several
other collectors, the price being at that
time the largest that had ever been
paid for one of the coinage named.
Since then one of the other coins had
been sc-ld for $1200, a record that held
good until last week, when H. G.
Brown of Portland, Or., paid $2000 for
the coin to R. G. Parvin, who succeed
ed to the ownership of the Dexter col
lection. Mr. Parvin did not willingly
part with thfi coin at that price, for
he has held it as the key piece of his
numismatic c&llection.
The scarcity of dollars of the 1804
"vintage" is explained by an accident
at sea. The larger part of the silver
dollars of that year was struck off to
pay United States soldiers and sailors
doing duty in Tripoli, North Africa,
and were shipped to that place. The
vessel that carried them away from
this country was never heard from
again, so the entire cargo is supposed
to â¢ rest somewhere upon the floor of
the Atlantic Ocean.
Just seven copies of the dollar of that
year are in existence, two lying in the
mint at Philadelphia and the others be
ing in private collections. In 1858 some
copies of the coin of 1804 were struck
off, being known as "restrikes," but all
but two of them were called in, the
records show, and destroyed. One cc-py
of the "restrike" is In the mint at Phil
adelphia and the other is owned in Eng
land. No counterfeit of the 1804 dollar
was ever known.â New York Commer

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
There was very little doing in the fruit
market and the houses were hardly paid for
thtir trouble In keeping open. Stocks of
Oranges were very large and consisted chiefly
of poor colored fruit, for which there v.-as no
demand whatever. Well colored Oranges were
very scarce and what few were offering were
firmly held. Eight or ten cars, including
three of fancy fruit from Redlanda. will be
offered at auction to-morrow and ought to
bring good prices as the fruit ia said to be
well colored and" the market is practically
bare of such stock at present. '

Under her old name, but wearing the
paint of Uncle Sam's navy, the collier
Saturn reached this port yesterday
from Comox with 2S00 tons of coal on
board. The coal, like the collier, be
longs to Uncle Sam, but where It will
be burned is a matter on which Captain
Joseph Newell, the collier's commander,
Is awaiting information. The Saturn is
here for orders. Her coal may be trans
ferred to the navy yard bunkers or to
the New York or Bennington, or the
Saturn may be ordered to carry it to
Honolulu or Panama.
The Saturn, which became a navy
collier during the war with Spain, is
well known at this port, which she has
not visited, however, for a long time.
She was owned formerly by the Boston
Towboat Company and came hero un
cier charter to tha Panama Railroad
Company. She ran between Inre and
the isthmus during the suspension of
friendly rela'tlons between the railroad
company and the Pacific Mail people.
When that difficulty was patched up
and until Uncle Sam purchased her the
Saturn engaged in the coast coal trade.
Her officers now are as follows: Cap
tain, Joseph Newell: first officer, J. T.
Rogers; second officer, B. il. Webb;
third officer, E. Phillips; chief en

Mile. Dilhan has the honor of hav
ing been the first woman to take part
in a murder trial in France. She\de
fended a woman In Tours who was
accused of having killed her son-in
law. The trial was a sensation, be
cause there was a woman lawyer In it.
There was no doubt about the murder,
but Mile. Dilhan got her client off with
the lowest possible penalty, such is the
well-known gallantry of French juries.

Very queer fish are caught in the
waters of Puget Sound. One kind is
called the candleflsh. It is dried and
packed in boxes like candles. We are
told the fishermen use them to light
their homes and that at one time, all
the boats on the sound used them in
stead of sperm oil lamps. By putting
the heads of the fish downward in a
candlestick and lighting the tail,
which, in conjunction with the back
bone, acts as a wick, it burns like a
candle. They eat this fish, and when
cooking it Is so fat It fries itself. â

Among all the cities of Europe ' and
America there is not one that offers- to
women the delightful variety of clubs
that London does. These organizations
are not women's clubs as we under
stand the term in America. It Is not
necessary to go in for politics. . for
woman's rights, for missionary work
at home or abroad. The clubs are con
ducted just as the men's clubs arc and
fulfill the same purpose. Â¦ - .
Take the New Century, for example,
in Berkeley Street "West, ircar the home
of Lord Lansdowne. the former Secray
tary of Foreign Affairs. As one enters
the big doors there are the small boys
In uniform ready to take In your card
If you are a visitor, or to hand your
letters and telegrams if you are a mem
ber. The hall is spacious, and at the
end facing the entrance is a wide stair
way leading to the- sleejung-rooms
above, to the bathroom and restrooms.
The big hall is finished in red and
white, and logs are burning in an open
grate. "
Beyond the reading and writing
rooms is the reception and tea room,
with a color scheme in pale green and
white. There is a corner fireplace, and
on cold, rainy afternoons the tables
and chairs are gathered about the
sparkling logs, the shaded lamps are
lighted and tea and toasted muffins are
brought in. In the summer tea 13 served
on a sort of tiled terrace formed by the
roof of the dining-room.
A SMOKIN'G-ROOM, TOO.
On the right of the entrance hall are
large dressing-rooms, with mirrors and
closets and plenty of lights and electric
curling Irons. Then comes the Oriental
smoking-room, with its open fire and
big easy chairs, its tiny tabourettes
holding matches and cigarettes and its
center table filled with late books and
papers.
Out in the west of London is a resi
dential club, with a room for each
member. It is called the Twentieth
Century Club and is almost exclusively
composed of working women. Here are
gathered writers, dramatists, artists
and those whose way in life leads into
the great commercial heart of the cit>.
A big garden, with shade trees and
flowers, is the favorite place for tea on
Sunday afternoons in the summer.
This experiment of a home club was
started by three millionaires, and it
has proved so successful that the prem
ises have been greatly enlarged in th*
last year, and the membership raised
from fifty to 100. In the 'summer the
Twentieth Century Club has addition
al Quarters on the island of Guernsey.
In the channel, near the beautiful shores
of Brittany.
WHERE NOTED WOSfEN" 3fEET.
On* Norfolk street, in the Strand, in
the very center of the old and fascinat
ing" part of London, where all the
houses are filled with historic mem
ories, is the home of The "Writers. At
its Thursday afternoon teas the rooms
are filled to overflowing with women
whose names are famous In the litera
ture of the day and singers and act
resses of international reputation.
This club Is going to abandon its old
quarters for more roomy ones; but It
must be with great regret to the mem
bers, for nowhere else will be found
the atmosphere of this part of London,
hemmed in, as it is. on all side3 by
old streets, old buildings and parks
that were the haunt3 of Dickens.
Thackeray, Goldsmith. Dr. Johnson and
other immortals.
In another historic quarter, not far
from the Strand, but near Drury Lane
and Covent Garden, is the Pharos Club.
This is one of the few mixed clubs in
London. It has spacious drawing
rooms, and once a week these are
filled by the members and their guests,
while f.ome well-known speaker talks
to the club on his hobby for an hour
or two. They are delightfully Informal
talks, and are usually followed by a
sort of general debate. Eligibility to
the Pharos Club consists in being: "In
sympathy with current thought," so
one can see that there is not much In
the way toward becoming a member:
but the candidate will sometimes find
It rather difficult to get the requisite
number of votes. It is an exclusive cir
cle, many of whose members bear titles
of greater or lesser degree.
One of the latest and most attractive
of these organizations is the "Woman's
Army and Navy Club, composed of the
wives, mothers, daughters and sisters
of the officers of the two services. The
membership, of course, is not limited
exclusively to them, but it is one of
the most, if not the most, exclusive
of all the London clubs, and to become
a member is to achieve a social suc
cess. ' Its rooms are exquisitely fur
nished.
A list of the other women's clubs In
London would be a long one. In all of
them the members have the privilege
of entertaining tnelr men friends and
acquaintances, as well as those of their
own sex, and delightful dinners and
luncheons . are given in the attractive
dining rooms.
Most Inquisitive Birds.
Of the birds undoubtedly the bluejaya
have the most inqulsitiveness. And
they are the most noisy in expressing
it, although crows will hold a close sec
ond place, if not fuHy the equaL . How
the jays screeched and whistled and
calledâ a confusion of all the sounds of
jaydomâ near my home recently. More
than a dozen darned into a small ever
green, tree on the lawn. People came
from several houses in the vicinity, all
curious to know "what is the matter
with the birds?" It seemed to be a
"want to know" on both sides. The
Jays had discovered a cat walkins
meekly along by the fence in the low
shrubbery near and under the spruce
tree. There was no nest in the vicinity,
and so far as could be ascertained the
cat had not attacked the jays. But
what a pandemonium of Jay jargon
over one meek looking, quiet cat! The
Jays outdid themselves, and called out
nearly all the occupants of the many
houses on that street. â St. Nicholas.
The law provides in the first place
that every dealer selling or letting a
pistol must enter the transaction in a
record book that will always be open
to the inspection of the police. In ad
dition it prohibits the sale or letting of
pistols to persons who do not have a
gun or game license unless they are
entitled by law to carry weapons with
out such license, or unless they are
householders who intend to keep the
pistols in their own homes, or unless
they wish the pistols for use abroad.
Furthermore, no one under the age of
18, except in a few exempt cases, is
permitted to buy, hire use or carry a
pistol under any circumstances. For
violations of the law the penalties
range up to $25, but where a dealer
knowingly sells a weapon to a person
Intoxicated or not of sound mind the
penalty may be a fine of $125 or im
prisonment with hard labor not ex
ceeding three months. Good results
are expected from this law, especially
as efforts are being made to acquaint
the entire population with its terms,
so that offenders will have little
chance to plead ignorance in excuse
of their acts. â Chicago Record-Herald.
Great Britain's criminal statistics
show a very small proportion of mur
ders as compared with the statistics
of the United States. The reasons for
this are to be found not merely In the
stricter enforcement of law and in the
heavier penalties inflicted, but also in
the pains that are taken to reduce, so
to speak, the facilities for murder. A
man with a pistol in his pocket may
kill another when he would not com
mit the crime If he had to go to a
store to purchase a weapon. A man
-who is able to buy a pistol at any
time that he has the price may kill
another when he would not do it if the
sale was under close restrictions.
Such restrictions are imposed by a
new .law passed at the last session of
Parliament, which British magistrates
are now busily engaged in enforcing.

"It was a new philosophy to a wait
er, in a hotel restaurant and he evi
dently did not understand it. The pa
tron had finished his meal, paid his
check and was disposing of the
change, while the waiter lingered near
with his eyes on the disappearing
coins.
" 'Are you waiting for a tip?' asked
the patron.
" 'Just as you please, sir,' answered
the waiter.
" 'Then I fear thafmy pleasure will
not be yours,' replied the patron. 'The
trouble is that your philospohy is all
wrong, and with wrong philospohy we
are sure to fall into all sorts of er
rors.'
" 'Yes, sir,' said the waiter, not un
derstanding a word.
" 'Now,' continued the patron, 'you
have the tip reversed from what it
should be. You put it wrong end to. . I
pay the proprietor for food and service,
and honors are easy between us. Now,
where do you come in? My wants make
you necessary. I really create your em
ployment.
" 'Without a patron to the house you
would be without a job. You are under
obligations to me for making your
presence here necessary, so if you put
tips on a philosophical basis you should
pay me. I am the reason for the pro
prietor hiring you. 1

In the import trade English vessels have suffered a loss of nearly 50
per cent. English vessels have carried nearly all the silver coin imported,
and the imports of silver coin beinff very heavy in 1902 and extremely
light in 1903 the trade of English vessels, viewed from the value standpoint,
is naturally i ore affected by that cause than are all other vessels com
bined. From the same cause the total volume of import values is naturally
.reduced. Â¦
Norwegian, German, French, Dutch and "all other" vessels show sub
stantial gains, while American and Spanish vessels are about in the same
position that they were in the last previous year. The vessels credited as
"all other" are nearly all Japanese, which vessels are beginning to compete
quite actively for the foreign carrying trade of the Philippine Islands.
In the export trade British vessels show a marked gain over the figures
for the previous year, but here again the item of Mexican silver coin ex
plains the most of the gain, as nearly all of the exports of Mexican silver
go to Hongkong on British vessels.
American, French, German and Norwegian vessels show considerable
gains and others remain about as last previous year. .

I XIQUE INVITATION.
There was a gay crowd last evening
ta the cozy quarters of the Family
dob at 228 Post street when the first
Christmas jinks of the club took place.
The wits of Bohemia, the bon-vi
vants and the good fellows who form
the memberEhip of the club assembled
for the purpose of "having a good
time," and they had it without stint.
The rooms were prettily decorated,
a nd care was thrown to the winds from
the hour of 9 o'clock until early this
morning.
The first part of the programme of
â¢The Christmas Row" was presided
over by Superior Judge John Hunt,
:ir.(f h? discharged his duties in a most
praiseworthy manner. There was a
j;ood supply of vocal and instrumental
ta'f-T on hand, and every number pre
errited met with vociferous applause.
The addresses given were in a light
and humorous vein and caused the
heartiest laughter. The close of, the
first part of the programme was fol
lowed by the appearance of Santa
Clans, impersonated by Judson E.
ISrusie, who w ; loaded down with
gifts for the club members.
At midnight the minstrel and spe
cialty performance was giv;n. It was
presented by club members, and the
fun reLned fast and f-rious. The af
fair was the most successful of its
l:ind ever given in The city, and re

There is hardly a family, rich or poor,
living in the country, village or suburbs
of a city, that may not, with advantage,
keep a small flock of poultry. W ith ordi
nary care it cannot help but prove re
munerative and be the means of consum
ing quantities of kitchen and table
scraps, which, with many families,
amounts to a good deal and is often ;
thrown away. Unlike the work required
in carlnsr for a largo number of fowls, a.
vcrv little time is needed to manage and
feed the small flock, and there is nothing
that will afford greater pleasure to^the
whole family than ten or twelve hens
all of one breed, but this is of secondary
importance as compared with what they
brlns in for the table in the shape of
eccs and- meat. No one knows how to
appreciate good fresh cgrgs and well fat
tened chickens until they have them of
their own production. A good many
have an idea that because their space is
limited so the fowls are unable to roam
over broad fields as on the farm, that
there is no use in trying to keep them.
This is a mistake, for while the farm is
an ideal place to raise and keep poultry,
some of the largest egg records have
been made by yarded hens, and some of
the birds in very close confinement at
that. The great variety of food gener
ally left over by the family is most ex
cellent egg producer, the only trouble
in keeping a few hens on such rations is
that they are apt to become over- fat,
but. -by a little caution on the part of the
feeder this may be avoided and a good
many eggs secured during the year from
, a dozen young hens.â Rural Calif oruiaxu

The novelist Thomas A. Janvier has
lived for a number of years' in France
and has collected many folk tales and
anecdotes of the French peasantry.
"I heard a story of a physician the
other day," Mr. Janvier said recently.
"He was a physician of Provence, and
one morning, stopping his gig, he en
tered into condescending talk with a
tombstone-maker.
"While the talk went on the tomb
stone man did not cease to work. He
had a chisel in one hand and a mallet
in the other. He was carving upon
his tombstone the words, 'Sacred to the
memory of â ; â ' and the rest he would
leave blank.
"This proceeding, for some reason,
amused the physician. Watching the
stonecutter, he laughed heartily. .
" 'Why, 1 said the other, 'do you
laugh?'
" 'Because your way of work amuses
me,' the physician said. 'Do you al
ways cut upon your, headstones the be
ginning of the obituary, and then
wait?'
" 'No,' said the stonecutter, 'not al
ways. When there is some one sick
and you are treating him I keep right
on.' "âKansas City Journal.

Improved methods in machinery and
the great change in the character of
materials used has had an important
bearing on the printing art. In the
earliest mills established in this coun
try the raw fiber, after being prepared
in the beating machine, was formed
into a sheet in a mold or wire sieve,
which was dipped from the pulp vat
by hand, the water drained off and the
pulp left in a wet sheet in the mold.
The sheets so made were turned out
upon a felt press and then dried by ex
posure to the air in single sheets. Such
mill3 were small and the output was
limited. Strictly hand-made paper to
day Is a rarity, although it exists. By
the aid of the Fourdrinier machine the
transformation of the fluid to stock or
finished paper is made an automatic
operation. The pulp i3 screened from
the vat over an apron to a moving end
less wire cloth made of closely woven
fine brass wire and supported by a se
ries of small metal rolls set close to
gether, yet without touching each oth
er. In this way an even surface of the
wire cloth is maintained, and by pre
serving an unvarying flow of the pulp
and a constant forward motion of the
wire cloth the thickness of the layer
of pulp deposited is kept uniform. By
lateral motion of the supporting rolls
the fibers are caused to> interlace in va
rious directions and give greater trans
verse strength to the texture. As the
pulp is carried along on the wire cloth
much of the water drains through,
leaving the fiber on the meshes. This
first drying is usually hastened by va
rious devices, and the moist web is car
ried between rolls which are covered
with woolen felt and then taken fx-om
the wire cloth on endles3 woolen felts,
which pass It between rolls and then
to dryers. These are large metal cylin
ders heated by steam. The paper has
now acquired considerable strength.
The water has been evaporated and
the heated cylinders complete the dry
ing process. The paper i3 then given
a smooth surface by the calender"" rolls,
which are smooth faced, heavy metal
rollers. Finally the finished paper is
reeled off in rolls and cut 'into sheets
of the desired size. A large paper mill
will make 250 tons of. finished paper a
day. The most modern machinery turns
out a continuous web of finished pa
per at the rate of 500 feat a minute.
The r raw material of wood pulp is
spruce, poplar, and in smaller quanti
ties various other woods are employed
Wood pulp has to a great extent super
seded the use of rags* and entirely so
in the manufacture of news paper. The

Supersedes Straw and Bags,

Marcus Mayer, the genial impres
ario of Mine. Adelina Patti, who is
soon to sing again in San Francisco,
is at the Palace, having arrived from,
the East in advance of the diva. The
famous songstress will give two con
certs in this city, the first on the even
ing of January 7 and the second on
January 11, the time intervening be
ing devoted to traveling to and from
Los Angeles, where she is to appear
one night.
Mr. Mayer insists that Patti's voice
has lost none of its charm, despite
what some of the Eastern critics may
have said of her and he predicts that
her farewell tour of this country will
be one of, if not the most, profitable
of the twenty-two she has made in
the United States. Her concert here
will be the twenty-fifth of her present
tour. Heretofore Patti has come to
the United States under engagement
to appear thirty times, but this time
she is to give sixty concerts, for each
of which it is reported that she re
ceives $5000, with the additional con
sideration of 50 per cent of all re
ceipts over $7500.
"The proof that Mme. Patti's
voice is still clear and strong," said
Mayer last evening, "has been fur
nished in her recent concerts in the
largest halls in this country.'' In Phil
adelphia she had a $13,000 house,
and in Brooklyn the receipts amount
ed to $9200. New York, Minneapolis
and St. Louis also contributed largely
to the prolris of the engagement."
Accompanying Patti are Mile. Roza
Zamels, violinist; tVIlle. Vera Margo-
Hes, pianiste; Wilfred Virgo, tenor;
Claude A. Cunningham, barytone, and
Anton Hegner, cello. Romualdo Sa
pio, who has been conductor of Pat
ti's operas- for many years, accom
panies her on her present. tour as di
rector. From San Francisco she will
go to Portland and Seattle for the
first time in her musical career, and
from there eastward by way of Butte
and Denver.
