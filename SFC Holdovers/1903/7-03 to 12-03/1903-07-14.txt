July 13.â Germany, and the United States are upon the threshold
of trade warfare!., German wines, beer. Bait, sausages, bev

this country - in Increasing quantities and valued at many
millions of dollars 'annually .will , be. barred. from this country
under the operation of the new.. pure food law,' which has
Just gone " Into effect. 1 Officials of the Agricultural Depart
ment make no "secret that the 1?ure food law is mainly de
signed to counteract the discriminations practiced by Ger
many against American - meats, fruits, canned goods, lum
ber and other articles of export to the fatherland.
Within a few days the first consignment of German foods
liable to inspection under the law.' which went Into 'Â¦ effect
on July 10.- will, arrive' and unless shippers have conformed to
the rigid requirements' of the new law the cargo will bÂ« re
jected. Â¦
The important statement is made at ' th t Agricultural De
partment that under this law German sausage, sparkling and
still wines, salt, beverages, beer and other food products
will be rejected and. if not taken back to the port from which
the cargoes wera shipped they will be destroyed. How se
riously this will affect ' German trade relations with ui may
be gathered from the fact that imports of snorkling and still
wines from that country amount annually to more than $1,300.
000; Imports of hops to more than (600,000; of malted liquors
to nearly $200,000; - of sausages to nearly $200,000; of sausage
casings to $190,000. while various other imports of food stuffs
from . Germany ~ aggregating several millions annually will
be severely affected' by the new law.
â¢ An official, from the German embassy called upon thÂ»
Agricultural Department authorities to find out what. the new
law signifies and to convey information to his Government
as to It3 possible effect upon German exports to this country.
It is learned here that the German Government U consider
ably worried by. the. new 'law. Dr. Wiley says that it Is sim

was crowded long before the meeting of the House. Lord

The roving' bands -of Yaquls have been- augmented of late

His plans also include a public road along each side of the

Dr. - Rossonl was reported to have said
in an interview yesterday:
"The Pope's pulse reached 90 pulsations
and over. Just calculate how many times
it has pulsated in ninety-three years and
you understand that In his present condi
tion all of his organs and the pulse must
end by getting so tired that they will
stop forever."
At the American embassy It was said
that no request, official or otherwise, had
been received up to yesterday for Infor
mation regarding the Pope's . condition.
King Edward . has instructed the British
Embassador, Sir Francis Bertie, to tele
graph twice dally the state of his Holi
ness.
The Tribuna printed last night that the
Pope's real illness was cancer of the
liver. Dr. Mazxoni characterizes the
statement as a falsehood without an atom
of foundation.
PARIS, July 14.â The Rome correspond
ent of the Eelalre telegraphs that when
the Pope was not in a somnolent condi
tion yesterday he suffered from nervous
contraction in all , his limbs and was un
able to bear the contact of the bed
clothes, which consequently bad to be
supported by wooden 1 hoops. '
According to a dispatch received here
from Rome, the -Pope's strength was
heavily, taxed and his sufferings Increased
by the. number of visitors, altogether
sixty-seven persons, whom . he , . received
during the past couple of days. Eighteen
Cardinals/ fifteen relatives /and a number
of high papal officials 'imposed their visits
upon him and, as the Pope wished to say
a few words^to each, the fatigue caused
fresh progress of his malady.
VITAL ORGANS EXHAUSTED.
Never before has the patient's weakness
progressed . as it did yesterday. For the
first 'time since his illness the Pontiff
asked to have the shutters almost closed,
as the light hurt his eyes, and, at the
same time, contrary to his custom, he
begged to be left as quiet as possible.
Another noteworthy symptom of his
awakening condition was the docility with
which he took his medicine ' and nourish
ment. Previouslyâ indeed, during his
whole life â Pope Leo has been against the
prescriptions of doctors or anything that
had the aspect of being. forced upon him.
His feeling of fatigue and Indifference
was interpreted as a sign that his vitality
was fast diminishing. Late last evening
nine Cardinals, Including Satolli and
Martinelll, were admitted to the sick
room, but the Pope could not even speak
to them, merely giving them his hand to
kiss. .1 -;:;
ROME. July 14, 2:56 a. m.â "While there
is life there is hope," was all the conso
lation that Dr. Lapponl would give to
night in admitting that Pope Leo's condi
tion was "very, grave."
The Pontiff has suffered another relapse
and he lies this morning in a more critical
condition than at any time since the mid
dle of last week. The semi-comatose con
dition into which he fell at midnight and
the confused state of his heretofore lucid
mind on his awakening at an early hour
this morning, accompanied by still great
er depression than during yesterday, are
regarded as symptoms of the gravest na
ture and as pointing to an imminent dls
solutlon. Even in the early evening 'med
ical opinion was less pessimistic and Dr.
Mazzoni believed the end .was not within
sight. He expressed the belief that unless
the disease took an unexpected turn there
was no reason to apprehend death for
two or three days. This statement, how
ever, did not relieve the anxiety of those
who know what powerful stimulants are
being administered. Some attribute the
Pontiff's extreme weakness to-night to
the excessive mental and physical efforts
undertaken yesterday in receiving visit
ors, hearing mass, etc.
EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESS.
The latest announcement by Lord Cran
borne in the House of Commons on June
25, indicating that Russia intends to keep
faith in Manchuria, has already had some
effect and the Japanese press this morn

The Japanese press continues to exhibit
excitement as to the Russian attitude in
Manchuria and on the borders of Korea,
but the Jiji and other papers of high

able settlement of outstanding Far East
ern problems.

political capital and was thoroughly ex

the members of the sinking fund."

little to the statements by Foreign Office
officials brought In Parliament from time
to time. The general tone of the corre
spondence Indicates a greater willingness
on the part of Germany to discuss In a
friendly way the question, after Colonial
Secretary Chamberlain's public advocacy
of retaliatory tariff policy.
On July 7 Germany suggested an Inter
change" of ideas with a view to a friendly
settlement. This suggestion was accepted
by Lord Lansdowne, although the British
Foreign Secretary In closing his note re
iterated Great Britain's refusal to admit
Germany's right to treat Canada or any
other colony granting special tariff con
cessions to the mother country as a sep
arate customs territory, to be. made to
suffer by retaliation for privileges granted
to the United Kingdom.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Hayti. July 13.-
The conflict between President Nord arid
the. Chamber continues. A state of siege
has been proclaimed and the national
guard has been summoned to arms.
The conflict is apparently the outcome
of- the discovery some months ago of al
leged extensive frauds in the issue of
Haytien Government securities. The
amount involved is about $2,000,000, and it
was alleged that securities were fraud
ulently issued with the complicity of the
National Bank of Hayti. The President
appointed a committee to probe the mat
ter and the Minister of. Finance, who was
opposed to the investigation, resigned.
President Nord vigorously denounced the
attitude of the Chambers and ' the Na
tlonal Bank as being hostile to the Gov
ernment. The troops cheered the Presi
dent, shouting "Down with the Cham
bers!"

manufacturer of Brooklyn and more re
cently a broker of the Consolidated
Stock Exchange and real estate operator,
was found dead in bed to-day at his home.
The room was full of gas and the police

NO SIGN OF APOPLEXY.
Report of Autopsy Surgeon Received
in San Rafael.
SAX RAFAEL, July IXâ Each day de
velops some additional evidence against
"Dr." John Donald Woods, and Alice Cloy
Wood. To-day District Attorney Boyd
received the offlcial report from the au
topsy surgeon, Dr. McKenzle. of Newark,
N. J. This report flatly declares that
Colonel William J. Best did not die from
apoplexy, and that the whole case is an
extremely suspicious one. Some of the
pieces of organs were not analyzed, but
are en route to San Rafael and upon ar
rival will be sent to a San Francisco
chemist in order that it may be de
termined Just what poisons were used.
The report received is as follows:
"Thomas P. Boyd, District Attorney, San
Rafael. Cal.â Dear Sir: Acting under your
telegram to Mr. Best, I made this after
noon aji autopsy upon the body of Wil
liam J. Best. I would say that the body
had been previously opened and the
stomach, intestines and lungs removed.
Nearly all of the organs were severed
from their connection with the body, but
were in the body. The brain was intact,
and showed no indication of apoplexy.
The case is exceedingly suspicious, and I
advise that a most thorough chemical ex
amination be made. Yours very truly,
"W. H. McKEXZIE.

Detective de Pue apprehended Ihatchki.
the Japanese, who was a servant in the
Woods household during Best's illness.
To-night he was interrogated by the au
thorities in the hope that he might throw
more light upon the case. The- District
Attprney received to-day a letter from
the former Chief of Police of Harrisburg,
Pa., asking tor information about Mrs.
Wood and an infant child. The letter Is
as follows:
Dear Sirâ I have read a newspaper erticlft
referring to the arrest of Dr. J. D. Woods and
Miss Alice Cloy Wood for causing the death of
Colonel William Best, who died in your city
during April. 1903. Can you inform me
â¢whether or not Mrs. J. D. Woods and infant
child are living yet in your city or elsewhere?
The infant was three to five years old when
residing In Harrlsburg, about 1895 or 1808.
The Woods people are well known here and
considerable interest Is aroused in their recent
escapade. They were Â»ubjects of notoriety
when living In thlÂ« city. S. J. ANDERSON
SEATTLE. Wash.. July 13,-WIlliam E.
Best of this city, mentioned In the Eas
ton (Pa.) dispatch, said to-day:
"The Etatement of Mrs. Woods that tha
autopsy was ordered by me is an error.
At the time I heard of my father's death
in California I wired there ordering the
body embalmed and prepared for ship
ment East, and that was done. Upon the
arrival of the body in the East the cir
cumstances were such that an autopsy
was made at the instigation or the offi
cials who were investigating the case and
fully consented to by my brother. That
autopsy revealed the fact that peculiar
actions had been performed by the men
who had had charge of the body prior to
Its shipment from California."

the Association of Mexican War Vet

lively interest in the affair. The exer
cises were held at the northwest corner
of Post and Market streets and were wit
nessed by a large number of people.
A slight hitch in the arrangements was
caused by the absence of Colonel S. W;

sided in his stead and the programme
proceeded. The proclamation issued . by

Chairman O. H. P. Bailey.
-J. W. Hines, a prominent member qf the
Pioneer Society, made a ringing speech,
in which he related the history of the
flag-raising event. Addresses were also
made by Major E. A. Sherman of San
Francisco, an officer of the Mexican War, 1
and by Captain J. C. Boyorth, also a vet
eran of the Mexican War and a partici
pant in the battle of Buena Vista.
When Commodore Sloat raised . the
American flag at Monterey, July 7, 1846,
Governor Jose Castro was in charge of
San Jose for the Mexican Government.
When this act was accomplished the com
modore, sent a messenger to San Jose to
announce the fact and immediately Qov

hoisted the American flag on a staff in

There was much speculation In the post
office to-day over the sudden return to
the city of a half dozen postal inspectors.
It is paid that some of the postal^nspec
tors served a number of subpena#*to-day
on officials of trust companies and banks,
requiring them to produce the books of
their concerns befcre a "John Doe" in
vestigation scheduled to be held within a
few days in Washington. The nature of
the investigation could not be ascertained
and the names of those served were
guarded with great secrecy.
The investigation of the railway mail
transportation service was taken up to
day. Acting Second Assistant George F.
Btone was called into conference with
the Postmaster General and Bristow this
afternoon. Previous to that conference
Bristow received some documents and
material from John M. MaEten, assistant
superintendent of the rai'road mail serv

CALL BUREAU, 14^6 G STREET N.
W\, WASHINGTON, July ItâNotwith
ettndir.g the oft repeated statement that
the end cf the postal investigation is in
tight, there were a number of important
conferences and developments to-da?
which proved that the final chapter of the
ecandal may be most sensational. Post
master General Fayne and Fourth Assist
ant Bristow, the sleuth of the depart
ment, were in consultation for more than
an hour late this afternoon, and it is un
derstood there will be a general sweeping
cut of subordinates of the Postoffice De
partment.
The Grand Jury will reassemble to-mor
row and has received instructions to con
tinue the postal fraud cases. It is un
derstood that George W. Beavers, former
eupcrintendent of the division of salaries
and allowances, will be called to testify
before the Grand Jury and that his testi
mony will be rather incriminating in
character, while involving officials whose
names have net i.jjjÂ»eared in the postal
ecandal thus far.
Commissioner Procter of the civil serv
ice board was in conference with Post
master General Payne to-day and efforts
are bring made to smooth over the diS
culty wh:ch has arisen over the appoint
ment of skilled laborers, messengers and
clerks from lists offered by the commis
eioik. Postmaster General Payne prom
ised to give all the co-operation possible
to the efforts of the civil service depart
ment to apply the regulation of the merit
law more rigidly to the postal service.
There is, nevertheless, a feeling in some
quarters that the assistance rendered the
civil service cemmirsion is only half
hearted.
facial Dispatch to The Call
The convention was in full progress at
4 o'clock and, although there were signs
of rain and some wind was blowing, no
trouble was looked for by the manage
ment. The sides of the tent were up to
admit the air and this enabled the squall
to lift up the big canvas as if it were a
balloon. The gust of wind which carried
over the tent came so suddenly that no
preparation could be made to forestall
the consequences. The wind swept under
the tent, the roof of which bellied out
like an immense sail and it was seen
that the -poles were being drawn from the
ground. The smaller guy poles gave the
first intimation of danger to the throng,
being pulled from the ground.
Immediately the 8000 peisons were In a
panic, which the screaming of the women
accentuated. It was then that Ramsay
sprang to a chair and loudly called on the
men to hold up the canvas and catch the
larger supporting poles as they fell and
avert that danger. Hundreds of men
sprang to their feet and successfully car
ried out the Chicago man's suggestion
and consequently no, one was injured in
this way.
As the poles fell more than 1000 persons
who were seated near the walls of the
tent escaped the folds and these imme
diately formed themselves into a relief
corps. The hospital tent was speedily
filled with women who had fainted and
those who were suffering from injuries.
SUDDEN GUST OF WIND.
A feature which showed the religious
nature of the participants was seen when
the majority were extricated from the
canvas folds. Led by an Eastern delegate,
all gathered around in tho open air and
an impromptu praise service was held.
Among those who are suffering from se
vere nervous shocks are: Miss Blanche
Fearer. Oregon, 111.; Miss Adams. Oregon.
111.; Miss Nipper. Pueblo, Colo.; Miss
iuyrtle Moore, Warren, 111.; Mrs. Small,
Denver.
The more seriously injured are: Mrs.
Thornburgh. Denver, very bad wound In
forehead; Allela Murdock, Denver, arm
fractured; J. C. Peterson, Alamoaa, Colo.,
scalp wound and shock; Mis* Mary Ellis,
Denver, bruised about body; Miss Powers,
Trenton. Neb., knee injured, body
bruised; Mrs. I. N. Johnson. Denver, bad
ly bruised and fainted from fright; J. C.
Patterson, Alamosa, Colo., head hit by
electric lamp, bad scalp wound; Miss Etta
Ward. 1515 West Taylor ctreet, Chicago,
large pole fell across back and badly
bruised her.
Mrs. Winifred Sleep of Denver, who was
in charge of the St. Mark's Hospital tent,
seeing the catastrophe at the big tent,
telephoned the electric company to shut
off the current. This prevented any dam
age being done by live wires, for of
course they fell with the poles.
SOME OF THE INJURED.
The presence of mind of A. M. Ramsay
of Chicago, who sprang to a chair and
called to the Endeavorers to hcid up the
canvas and poles, undoubtedly prevented
danger of suffocation, but as it was many
women fainted and were extricated from
the folds of the canvas with much diffi
culty.
Mrs. Jessie M. Thornburgh of Denver
was the moat seriously injured. Her nose
was -crushed and she sustained several
scalp wounds.

The results of these separate Investiga

general charge of the California work,
and will be presented to the State in a
formal report, accompanied by maps.
The bureau will also make a study of
the chaparral lands of Southern Califor
nia in order to learn whether it will pay
to plant them with timber trees. A very
Interesting question has been raised as
to whether . chaparralâ which includes a
great variety of scrub trees, such as
manzanlta. scrub oak. valley mahogany
and scrub cherryâ will retain the mois
ture in the soil well as timber trees.
Chaparral growf^enser than timber trees
and often reaches a height of twenty to
twenty-five feet and a diameter of six
teen to eighteen Inches. L. C. Miller, who
has charge of this work, is now making
a study of the conditions under which
chaparral grows in the San Gabriel Moun
tains, near Pasadena, where the bureau
has been planting pines and cedars for
several years.
The effects of fire on the forest, espe
cially after lumb.erlng, and what may be
done by the State to prevent fire are sub
jects that will take a long time to work
out. In September E. A. Sterling of the
bureau will try to determine what is the
cheapest and most effective method of
protecting from fire land that has been
lumbered.
The work has been begun on a large
scale. Six men are now examining pub
lic lands in the State to determine what
parts of them are suitable for. national
forest reserves, and similar studies will
be made of lands for State reserves. A
etudy will, be made of all lands owned
by the State in order to determine the
uses to which they may best be put, who
should administer them, and what port
of administration they should have. A
forest map of California will be made,
showing the location of all forest areas
and distinguishing between the different
kinds of forest. In connection with the
forest map will be a study of important
trees In order to learn with exactness the
commercial range of the valuable species.
An investigation will be made of the ef
fects of lumbering on the forest in order
to determine what ought to be done to
cut-over lands. It is of great importance
to know what happens to the land in dif
ferent parts of the timbered regions after
it is cut over by the lumbermanâ whether
it comes up again in timber of whether
â¢It becomes, waste land.
policy, California has undertaken this
year, with the help of the Bureau of For
estry, a comprehensive and detailed study
of its forests. The State Legislature re
cently appropriated $15,<X#.for the study,
the condition being that it should be car
ried out by the Bureau of Forestry and
that the bureau should bear half the ex
pense. â¢
The State desires to know those facts
about its forests that will guide it in
passing wise forest laws. It desires to
know, for instance, what disposal should
be made of the State forest lands, what
should be done to regulate the cutting of
timber on them, how forest fires may best
be restrained, whether tree planting In
denuded areas will pay, etc.
The task of securing all the informa
tion necessary for a forest policy for Cal

.magnitude that several years will be re

his father's body had been embalmed

MRS. WOODS WRITES.
NEW YORK. July lS.-That Dr. John
D. Woods and his wife are now in Canada
is believed by relatives cf Colonel Best.
They base this belief on the fact that the
letter written to the editor of a newspaper
in Easton. Pa., by Mrs: Woods was
mailed ir. Buffalo. X. Y., on Friday last.
It was written on paper of a hotel at
Niagara Falls. Â¦
When this came to the knowledge of
the late Colonel Best's sons to-day, Alfred
M. Best telegraphed to the Chief of Police
of Buffalo that a detective from San Ra
fael was expected here daily with war
rants for the arrest of the Woods and
with extradition papers. He told of the
crime of which they are accused and also
reminded the chief that Wocd3 is a fugi
tive from justice in this State. This was
a reference to Woods' disappearance after
he had been arrested in Oloan thirteen
years ago on a charge of bigamy pre
ferred against him by the woman who is
now with him.

It has been observed that the unpleas
ant sensations when on board of a ship
come on usually as the vessel sinks down
into the trough of the sea. The same
sensation is felt in an elevator as It
starts ' on its downward trip. A simple
remedy to overcome this trouble is rec
ommended by O. Bornbluth: Just as the
vessel sinks one should take a 'long
breath and hold it for a* few moments.
This inflates the abdomen and fixes 'the
diaphragm, and If continued for some
time Is effectual in keeping away the un
pleasant nauseous* sensations.
As a preliminary treatment he also rec

At once his prejudice against begging

"I'll give you a dollar for that coin!"

Lord Avebury read a paper at the meet
ing of the Geological Society of London,
on May 27, on the formation of moun
tains. According to the report in the
Times, he said that experiments had been
made long ago by Sir J. Hall, and after
ward by Daubrle, Ruskin, Cadell and
others, by arranging layers of cloth, clay,
cement, etc., and studying the folds and
fractures which resulted when they were
compressed. In all these experiments,
however, the pressure was in one direc
tion only, whereas it was obvious that if
mountains were due. at any rate in part,
to the contraction of the earth, in nature
the contraction and consequent pressure
took place from all sides. Lord Avebury
said that he therefore provided himself
with a square case compressible on all
four sides at once. In the central space
he arranged layers of sand, cloth, etc.,
and compressed them, thus throwing
them into folds. He then took -in each
experiment four casts in plaster of paris.
beginning from, the top, and these casts
were exhibited to the society. They pre
sented an Interesting analogy' to actual
mountain districts, though, of course,
they did not show the results of subse
quent denudation due to rain and rivers.
It had long been observed that mountain
ous districts showed two sets of lines at
right angles to one another. Any one
who would glance at a map of Scotland
would see this clearly. One set was rep
resented by the Great Glen, with the
lochs and valleys parallel to it. the sec
ond series at right angles to it; by the
Sound of Mull, etc. This characteristic
of mountain regions had long been
known, and there had been discussions
as to whether the folds were simultane
ous or successive. Lord Avebury's casts
showed this feature very clearly and it
was evident that the cross foldings took
place simultaneously.â N. Y. Sun.

INVITATION FROM: IRELAND.
Not to be outdone In courtesy. Admiral
Beresford took up a position In front of
the British bluejackets forming the royal
escort, who were drawn up on the dock
facing the battleship Kearsarge. Obey
ing a sharp order, the detachment pre
sented arms, while the British band
struggled, with rather poor success,
through the "Star Spangled Banner." As
the escort marched away the Americans
again rendered "God Save the King."
During his Inspection of the Kearsarge
the Prince of Wales evinced a deep In
terest in the superimposed turrets, and,
in response to his request. Captain Hemp
hill conducted him inside the forward
double turret. The Prince stepped to en
ter the lower turret and mounted the
ladder leading to the upper S-lnch guns
turret
"Did the German Emperor do this?"
asked he.
Captain Hemphill replied: "Emperor
William never grot so hieh."
The Prince of Wales asked numerous
questions regarding , the superimposed
turrets, particularly Inquiring how rap
idly the guns could be lowered. Midship
man Belknap, In charge of the forward
turret, ordered a round of ammunition
from the magazine to the 13-inch gun.
The operation was rapidly performed, to
the apparent gratification of the Prince.
"The Prince Is a naval officer and
knows what he is talking about." said
Captain Hemphill.
On the Prince of Wales expressing a
desire to inspect the ship Captain Hemp
hill escorted him along the gun deck of
the superstructure and also below. The
Prince apparently had already some
knowledge nf the Kearsarge, as he was
familiar with her characteristics. At the
conclusion of the Inssection the Prince
complimented Captain Hemphill on the
splendid condition of the battleship.
The departure of the Pfjce of Wales
was marked by the samy ceremony as
on his arrival. He came on deck, accom
panied by Admiral Cotton, and saluted
and shook hands with the admiral and
the officers of the Kearsarge and the
captains of the other American ships. As
the Prince crossed the gangway Lieuten
ant William V. Pratt of the Kearsarge
shouted. "Three cheers for his Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales." The
same cry arose simultaneously on the
other American sniDs and the crews of
the four vessels heartily hurrahed, the
Prtoce standing in the center of a group
of officers with his hand at salute.
As the Prince's train pulled out from
the station the American squadron fired
a royal salute and the bands played "God

Reports from Omaha are to the effect
that Rutherford has not intimated there
that he has any intention of making
changes in the personnel of the San Fran.

case where a new man takes charge of
an office that he does not have some fa

In Connecticut and in Delaware Smith's
Jurisdiction .has been extended to the
plants within those States. It does not
necessarily follow that the California pe
tition will be similar. It is possible that
it will be for a separate receiver.
Receiver Smith's attorneys made appli
cation for an ancillary -ecelvershlp In
Delaware on Saturday. This Is not an
unusual proceeding and Is proper in this
case, especially because of the fact that
the Delaware plant needed and had to
have financial aid. It is probable that
the Maine plant is In the same financial
tangle and that a receiver is needed to
keep It going. The San Francisco plant
is the best fixed financially. buMt Is like
ly that an application will be made ere
long, unless some reorganization plan is
adopted.
Lawyer Untermeyer of Smith's counsel
denies that the Maine court refused to
appoint a receiver. Receivers have, in
fact, been appointed in Delaware and
Connecticut. He says Judge Putnam de
cided only that he would require notice
of application to be given as customary.
Judge Putnam will hear the application
to-morrow.
WILMINGTON, Del.. July 13.â In the
United States Circuit Court to-day James
Smith Jr. of Newark, N. J., took the nec
essary oath before Judge Bradford, as re
ceiver, of the United States Shipbuilding
Company for the District of Delaware
and cave bonds in the sum of $50,000. the
American Surety Company of New York
being on the bond. Smith at once as
sumed his duties as receiver of the local
plant, formerly the establishment of the
Harlan & Holllngsworth Company. The
receivership, it iÂ« said, will make no dif
ference with respect to the affairs of the
Harlan & Hollingsworth Company, which
will be oDerated as heretofore.
"Well, we do not know yet," the re
ceiver replied. "Even the lawyers seem
in doubt about that.''
In order to get Into control of the prop
erties the receiver had terminated these
leases. The order, the receiver said, did
not include the Bethlehem Steel plant.
"The Bethlehem Steel Company does
not stand on a par with the other sub
sidiary companies?" -was asked of the re
ceiver.
NEW YORK, July 13.â A long confer
ence between Receiver Smith and counsel
was held at the offices of. the United
States Shipbuilding Company. The con
ference, the receiver said, was one of
many which have been held lately In re
gard to the legal phases of the receiver
ship. He said that he had signed an order
terminating the leases of the subsidiary
shipbuilding plants. In the organization
of thÂ« United States Shipbuilding Com
pany, he said, the properties of the sub
sidiary shipbuilding companies were ac
quired and then leased back to the sub
sidiary companies for one year, with a
proviso by which the leases might be
terminated at five days' notice by" the pa
rent company. The properties were leased
upon a rental to consist of the earnings
of the plants.
The appointment of General Oliver, it
can be* said, is r <iulte to Sen
ators Platt and Dep"ew, who were con
sulted regarding it.
General Oliver served in the Civil War
as a volunteer officer and subsequently
as an officer of the regular army estab
lishment. In both the infantry and cav
alry branches. For many years he has
been Identified with the National Guard
of New York, and now is a brigadier gen
eral in command of the brigade whose
headquarters are at Albany. General Oli
ver is engaged in the iron business and
is quite as prominent in commercial cir
cles as he is in military affairs.
In connection with the consideration of
appointments, it can be said that the
President has not thought seriously of
naming Charles S. Francis of Troy, N. Y.,
as Embassador to Italy, because, so far
as the President is aware, Embassador
Meyer has no Intention of resigning that
post. The rumor, it is said, is on all
fours with that which indicated that Em
bassador McCormick was to retire from
St. Petersburg, to be succeeded by Mayor
Low of New York.
The appointment of Oliver has been in
contemplation for some time, as It has
been known that Secretary Sanger de
sired to retire. His resignation was
placed in the hands of the President to
be accepted as soon as convenient.
It has not been decided definitely when
General Oliver will assume his new of
fice, but as Colonel Sanger desires to re
linquish his duties as soon as possible
the probabilities are that General Oliver
will undertake the duties of the office as
soon as he can arrange his business af
fairs.
OYSTER BAT.'l, I., July 13.â At the

In the confession Fischer further dis
closed many sensational facts of his
eventful life. He claimed he had been a
criminal since birth and had often robbed
his employers, as well as perpetrated
other crimes, for which he had been pun
ished. He asserted that he had no. desire
to kill his wife until she suggested the
operation. As soon as she became uncon
scious, he said, the insane desire to do
away with her was paramount In his
mind, while the greed for gold made the
desire ungovernable. He thought he could
burn the body and thus leave no trace,
and then collect the Insurance on her life.
Soon Rfter his confession he was sen
tenced to be hanged within sixty days,
the minimum limit. Thus it fell on a
Tuesday. Fischer arrived at San Quen
tin on May 1 and since that time until
Friday has occupied condemned cell No.

death chamber and J. Connell and F.
Abrogast were appointed as death watch.

he has been very uncommunicative and

Fischer will be executed to-morrow morn

firft man ever executed in California on

hanging at San Quentin on a day other
than Friday, and to-morrow will be the
second occasion of that kind.
Frederick C. Fischer killed his wife on
April 23, 1>J3, in Riverside. The crime
created great excitement in the Southern
California town and the officers there had
great difficulty In keeping the culprit out
of the hands of a mob. The young wife
had a sore eyelid and the husband sug
gested that she inhale chloroform in or
der to undergo an operation. She con
sented and soon became insensible. Pre
viously Fischer had had his wife's life
Insured for $1000. While phe waa uncon
scious he poured oil on her body and at
tempted to destroy it by setting fire to
the building. The evidence against the
man was slight when he was arrested
upon suspicion, but after several nights
in Jail he 6ent for the Sheriff and con
fessed. He told minutely how he had
done the deed and declared that he wish

"The command has been obeyed," the
preacher remarked, "and the various
branches are woven together into the
same booth. Putting on the prophet's
mantle, 1 declare that in the next few
years we are to see a great change in
church organisation and methods. The
denominational brÂ«mchea are to be woven
together into the same booth. The church
will no longer trail In the waie of secular
enterprise. Combinations, trusts and
economy of resources are in the air, and
the church must combine. When it Is
sought to evangelize a city, how foolish it
is to build a half-dozen edifices of wor
ship in the central blocks. The ideal way
to evHngellze and to furnish church facili
ties for a city of this population would be
for all denominations to Join forces in
one organization, build a central audito
rium that will seat 5000 or 6000 people,
then distribute chapels and prayer meet
ir.gs and Sunday-schools in the outlying
districts. Three ministers, with a corps
of deaconesses for visiting work, would
be euSlcient- There would be fewer ser
mons to preach, hence more time to pre
pare, and a larger crowd of listeners,
ber.ee more Inspiration to stimulate de
livery.
"Among the ministers let there be im
mersicnists and asperskmists, so that all
who unite may have their choice. At
communion let there be two vestries, one
who commune with those immersed and
one for those who hold that baptism is
not prerequisiteâ one man as good as an
otber if baptized with thimbleful or bar
relful. Under such regime the church
would have a marvelous effect on the
world. Thousands to whom it is now a
sealed book would be led to follow the
crowd. Church unity will ba the glory
of the coming age."

Years of Severe
Heart Trouble.
Obtained No Relief
Until I Tried
Dr. Miles* Heart Cure-
It Cured Me.
Since the advent of Dr. Miles' Heart Care
the general public has learned to know that
heart disease ii csnible. Fluttering, palpi-
tation, shortness of breath and heart pains
-rapiciy disappear before its magic influence.
It is onequalled as a heart and blood tonic
"My case was' one of Ion; standing. As
early in life as my thirty-sixth year, or more
particuJarijr November, 1863, when returning
Lome from a jocrorr, I was taken with a se-
vere congestive chill, which caused my whole
frame to shake, aad which a noted physician
pronotnred a ca&e of severe congestion of the
heart. From that time on for thirty years I
gradually became enfeebled in health, until
1892, ray sufferings became intense from
shortness of breath and palpitation of the
heart, I coald obtain no permanent relief,
although I spent much money in procuring
medical advice, until I took several bottles 1
of Dr. Miles 1 New Cure for the Heart I
continued the remedy until my health was
restored, and always keep a supply on hand
for any emergency. I am now past Jo years
of age and weira 176 pounds. 1 hare also
used Dr. Miles' Nerve and Liver Pills, Anti-
Pain Pills and Nerve Plasters with good re-
sults. The Anti-Pain Pills proved most
effective in a most paintul attack of neu-
ralgia, and also for sciatica. It is my exper-
ience that the remedies can be relied upon
absolutely crcrj time they are properly
osed."â W. G. Bowers, Beaver City, Utah.

â¢ As many people were turned away from
Fischer's. Theater last night as the house
holds.- By. the time the 1 curtain rose on
the first act people crowded the*alsles and

room."-, Never did this popular resort have
a more successful production. From the
moment that Misses Hope and Emerson
came, upon the stage and gave their
clever* song- and dance. Imitating . the
famous â¢; Cherry sisters, the enthusiasm
was unbounded. As the Peroxide Sisters
they had Â¦Â¦torespond to, no less than six
encores. .Their "make-up" and costum

themselves into favor from the start. The

that this popular house gives. There are
a number, of* original specialties and nov

After an Â¦ illness of six years duration
Mrs. Ida M. Stringer passed away yes
terday, at the residence of her daughter,
Mrs. L. Eugene Lee, 2744 Steiner street.
During all her years of suffering Mrs.
Jjjtrlnger was uncomplaining and was
cheerful even to the last. Mrs. Stringer
came to this country in'ISaS. when a mere
child. She was the wife of the late Wil
liam J. Stringer, a pioneer carpet and
furniture merchant and a member of Cali
fornia Commandery, Knights Templar,
and . California Lodge of Masons No. 1.
Mrs. Stringer was an ardent member of
the State Floral Society, the Academy of
Sciences and of the California Club. She
leaves a son and daughter, who were con
stantly at her bedside during her illness.
Her friends will remember her as a chari
table, hospitable and generous woman.

For' pure,- adulterated fun, In satisfy

-which- began the week last night with a
packed: house at the Central Theater, fills
the bill to perfection. The piece is an
extravagant farce-comedy, and the Peter

All that. could be: done for. the part of

She shows a bright and flexible humor,
womanliness, sympathy, seductive charm
and an emotional grip that roused the
audience to much noisy .testimony of ; its
pleasure. Her attractive sincerity, deep
earnestness and consclenceful art pervade
the whole- production that .from:; the
production standpoint Is unexceptionable.
Very handsome, too,, is 'the . picture she
makes, and the gowns are marvels. .
The best, chance, of -the 'piece goes to
Wilton' Lackaye, whose picture of the
FOUR hundred nights in' that amaz
ing New York is the record of "A
Modern Magdalen," presented here
for the first time last night by
Amelia Blngham and her excellent
i company. One wonders j wb,y that four
'hundred nights.- One deplores the waste
of Miss Blngham and people upon the
| material Mr. Chambers has here pro
j vided. One regrets the squandering of
some excellent material upon a play in
j its whole so unsatisfying.' Yet, for exam
j pie, the splendid portrait of the Mlcawber
j like Jenkins, the many-faceted'opportuni
j ties of the central figure, together with
the brilliancy of thV acting, the delight
; fully complete setting of the picture, go
j far to explain the play|s vogue. â¢
j But it failed to. convince. Programmed
! as "a drama in four acts, by Haddon
j Chambers," the play is actually a dram
; atizatlon from .the Danish by the play
l wright, and herein lies its essential weak
! ness. The story is Danish, the tragedy
1 of the Old World, and in Its new setting-
Mr. Chambers nas laid the scene in' New
Yorkâ it becomes curiously incredible.
The original tang Is . untranslatable, the
atmosphere apparently Impossible of con
veyance. Thestory concerns iitself with
one ICatlhka, who is discovered in. a
wretched home in New York. She is the
daughter of a drunken father, and the
butt of a shrewish stepmother,- one tie
alone binding, her to. her homeâ the love
for a younger, sister. Katlnka Is beauti
ful, and we see her first flying from the
pursuit of a man about town who follows
her to her home. She repulses him. He
leaves her, â¢ but leaves - his visiting
card. She has been. looking for work ali
day without success. Then appears the
stepmother .with coarse reproach for. her
ill-fortune, and -her.- father, with a pro
posal of marriage from a rich old man
whom she has been eluding for a whole
year. But before this a young working
man, who shares the Jenkins â¢ roof , has
also asked for Katinka's hand. But he
is too poor. She will not marry him-be
cause he cannot help* her invalid sister';
Then, driven to madness- by her sister's
weakness, cowardice of her father, the
stepmother's brutal meanness, the ad
vances of the old man Brlnker, the close
of the first act finds Katinka.on her way
to the man about town. ' *
A marriage with Brinker would of
course have served, . and better served
Katinka's purposeâ but then no play. In
New York also she could have earned
otherwise the money necessary for her
sister's support. But then there could
have been no "modern Magdalen." One's
sympathy is ' demanded for an unneces
sary and horrible sacrifice, the sympathy
is not forthcoming.'; " . Â¦ â¢
The second act shows the Jenkins fam
ily settled in bourgeois splendor. in a new
home, the sister recovered, the mother
handsomely dressed, the father with the
flowing bowl. at will.. The change Is ow
ing to the contributions of Katinka, now
become a successful' music hall singer;
but of this the mother and daughter are
kept in ignorance by â¢ the father, who at
tributes their sudden' affluence to his own
exertions. Katinka comes â¢ home \ in â¢ all
her splendors and is. repulsed by. her'
mother and sister. '
The play is well staged and scened, and
if, the opening night may be taken as a
fair indication of the remaining perform
ances the -management and the public will
be. equally well pleased.

REDWOOD CITY. July 13.â The south
bound passenger train, which arrived
here at 4:20 o'clock this afternoon, ran
down a four-horse wagon Just within the
city limits, instantly killing John Culley
and injuring the driver of the team,
George O'Malley, who later died from
his injuries. One of the animals was
killed and the wagon was broken to
pieces.
The accident occurred at what is known
as "Finger's crossing," one of the most
dangerous crossings in this neighborhood
and where a number of lives have been
lost. So far as can be learned now
O'Malley whipped up his horses Just be
fore reaching the crossing and attempted
to pass in front of the train.
Both men had been working for P. J.
Foley of this place, hauling rock. O'Mal
ley was well known here, having rela
tives in the north end of the county at
Colma. The other man was not so well
known. Both bodies were taken to the
morgue by Coroner James Crowe. The
date for the inquest has not been fixed.

QUIET as is the world, and promising as are
the prospects of peaceful industry and trade
to all the nations, we are not yet out of dan
ger 01 battle and war. From two centers come inti
mations of strife that menace the peace of the world.
One of these is Port Arthur; the other is Constan
tinople. In the one the fate of Manchuria is in
volved; in the other the reorganization of the po
litical condition of the Balkan states. \
The report from Port Arthur is due to the recent con
ference there of a number of Russian officials of high
rank in diplomacy, war and civil administration. A dis
patch says that among the members of the conference
were Minister of War Kuropatkin, Admiral Alexieff,
the Russian Ministers at Peking and Seoul, the po
litical agents in China and Korea, including Pokoti
loff, recently Russian financial representative at Pe
king; General Dessino, the military agent in China,
the civil and military officers at Mukden, Harbin and
Kirin, and the administrator of Newchwang.
That is certainly a formidable array of dignitaries
to assemble in a place so remote from the seat of
Russian government. .Their proceedings, it is said,
were "enveloped in profound secrecy." The mystery
doubtless augmented the feelings of distrust with
which the conference was watched, and we are told
that the foreign commercial officials at Port Arthur
and at Newchwang are convinced that the probabili
ties of war are increasing rapidly. They hold that
the conference met for no other purpose than that of
preparing for an open rupture with Japan and pos
sibly with Great Britain.
The war rumors from Constantinople are of a simi
lar character. It is said a council of war has been
held at Yildiz Kiosk, and that the Turks have de
cided to send additional troops to the Bulgarian
frontier ready to cross the border at a moment's no
tice. The action of the Turks is reported to be due

San Francisco would highly appreciate the devel
opment of the scenic attractions of Oakland. A
surpassingly fine view of the bay and mountains is
had from the level land running from Sixteenth street
north. No city has a finer site for a park. Com
mercialism is not occupying it, but the coming con
vention of Oakland ladies should observe that,
though on the windward side of their city, it is used
for a vast garbage dump, and all the overland and
local travel that passes . it looks out upon piles of
filth that fester in the sun, and shine and stink and
stink and shine, like John Randolph's rotten mac
kerel by moonlight.
Mayor Ohiey has right ideas about the city he is
called to govern. If he succeed by help of the ladies
in developing its latent beauty, cleaning it up, put
ting crematory and garbage where they belong, and
ending that hideous, cancerous, pestiferous, fly
breeding veneering of filth', upon which hundreds of
thousands of people look with rising gorge as they
pass West Oakland, he will not only deserve many
re-elections, but a monument in the park that ought
to be where filth now is. ..
The fact is that the charming towns in Switzer
land, with gem-like lakes in front and the Alps be
hind them, are concentrated centers of the spirit of
commercialism. Their people do not trade nor man
ufacture anything. Their business is the fleecing of
the admiring tourist. When they ornament their
water front the purpose is as purely commercial as
when we build docks and slips, coal bunkers and the
various devices required in the passing of commerce
into and through our great cities. We do not say
that this is discreditable to them, but only to empha
size the fact that commercialism in one form is just
as creditable as in the other. Our cittes need beauti
fying. No one denies that, and if these traveled
ladies return with the sentiment which inspires their
letters they can be made a force for advancement in
Maj-or Olney of Oakland has declared his intention
of calling the women together in a city beautifying
convention some time in September. The idea is
original and attractive. Such a convention need not
insist on tearing down the coal bunkers and remov
ing the shipyards which are on the estuary of San
Antonio. If they are in the mood to use the besom
they will find a garbage crematory located in the
midst of the best residence part of their city, against
the protest of every property-owner in sight of its
ugly chimney. The Mayor's convention will find a
scenic water front in Lake Merritt. the finest water
park in the world, but with ignoble surroundings,
though there is no commerce on its shores.
SEVERAL lady residents of Oakland and- San
Francisco now doing the grand tour in Europe
are writing home interesting letters on the sub
ject of scenic and landscape features in cities. These
communications have an antithetical quality. They
praise small places like Lucerne for its hotels and
drives on the lake front, and one writer who has been
in Asia recalls the avenues and drives along the
water front of cities in that part of the world. With
these pleasant memories of boulevards and avenues
along the water the writers want the same at home
and at once. It is demanded that hotels line the
water front of Oakland and that the same be turned
into a flower-bordered promenade, and that the San
Francisco water front, "now entirely abandoned to
commercialism,"' be fixed up the same way.
While these suggestions are so impracticable as to
be amusing, the sentiment behind them is right and
needs only direction to make it useful to any city
in which it is found. The cities in Europe and Asia
which give up their water fronts to scenic and land
scape treatment and use as places of amusement and
recreation are not commercial cities. American sea
ports exist at all for commercial reasons, and if
they were turned into tourist resorts and their water
fronts were given up entirely to esthetic uses, where
would we get our provisions into market and our
coal to cook them, and where, in fact, would we find
the business to^earn the money that enables dur peo
ple to go abroad and spend it in places made beau
tiful for the purpose of drawing travel for the profit
that is in it?

THIRD-STOKY PLANS.

The additions to the Hall of Justice are to
be upon lands to be acquired, but at present
privately owned, easterly from Dunbar alley
fronting on Washington street. It is proposed
to lntermeet the County Jail and the Hall 01
Justice at the level of several floors by means
of a covered â¢ oaesage, sufficiently elevated
above Dunbar alley to avoid interference with
the uae of the alley roadway.
The County Jail will be a six-story brick
structure of an architectural type conforming
to that of the Hall of Justice. It will have
a frontage on Merchant street of 100 feet, on
Dunbar alley 13T feet, 6 inches, and on Wash
ington street 100 feet.- It is to be a slx-ntory.
fireproof structure. The first two stories are
to be of sandstone,' the rest of the building
of brick with terra cotta trimmings.
The ground floor lr to be set apart for use
of the Coroner, space b*ine afforded for a
main office room and a private office, two
witness rooms, an inquest room, an exposure
room, a' cold storage room, a wash room, two
store rooms, chemical analysis room, autopsy
room, recotd room, a vault, boiler and engine
room, corridors, clothes closets and the like.
The main entrance Into the building will be
on Dunbar alley and opens into a vestibule
and main hall from which a stairway and
two elevators will afford access to the upper
stories. One elevator may be 6et apart for
the exclusive use of prisoners.
There will also be an entrance from Mer
chant street.
In the second story will be an office and
four administration rooms for the Sheriff, a
record r<;om, elf sets and vault, a hospital
ward, dining-room, four Jailers* bedrooms,
an officers' dlninjr-room. a commissary store
room, a prisoners* kitchen with dumb waiters
to the uuoer stories and to an outside pas
sage along the easterly side of the building,
a laundry and drying-room, a fumlaating
room. llr.Â«n closets, clothes closets and lava
tories. The floor of the second story is at
the same helcht as the first floor ot the Hall
of Jueilce.
The site selected for the new
County Jail lies just easterly from Dun
bar alley, and is separated from the Hall
of Justice by this small street. Owing to
the proximity of the sites ft is proposed
that the Jail be connected with the Hall
of Justice by Inclosed bridges.
A statement regarding the proposed im
provement follows:
PLANS and specifications for the
proposed County Jail to be erected
In this city are rapidly nearins
completion. " ,
BRYAN has at last given to the public his views
of the recent Democratic convention in .
Iowa. He explains in the current number of j
the Commoner that he did not speak at first because |
he "had not secured the information necessary for
an intelligent discussion of the situation." He has
now obtained the information and declares the con
vention "was controlled by the reactionary elements
of the party, and the refusal of the convention to re
affirm the Kansas City platform was due principally
to the influence exerted by^ the representatives of
corporations, but partly- to neglect on the part of
friends of the platform."
As an explanation of the way in which the cor
porations captured the convention Mr. Bryan says:
*The corporation Democrats. are in politics as , a'
matter of business;, they assume that their salaries ;
cover their political services and they can attend
conventions at little expense, while the ordinary
Democrat must pay his way." As evidence of the
validity of that theory Mr. Bryan quotes statements
of the Creston American to the effect that in several
counties there were chosen as delegates to the con
vention a number of Bryanites and a number of re
organizers, with the Bryanites in a majority; but
when the time c*ame for the convention to assemble
the reorganizers attended to a man, while a good'
many of the Kansas City platform men stayed at
home. -
The American says: "The Wapello county con
vention, for instance, passed resolutions indorsing
the Kansas City platform. They did not, however,
instruct their delegates. Of the seventeen delegates
selected nine were in favor of reaffirmation, but only
a few of the nine attended, and the majority of the
votes of the county were cast against reaffirmation,
although the county convention had by vote de
clared in~favor of indorsement. Mills County is an
other example. The county convention passed reso
lutions indorsing the Kansas City platform, and yet
the vote of that county was cast solidly against it."
Upon that showing one would suppose Mr. Bryan
as a representative of political principle would call
upon all true Democrats to repudiate the action of
the convention and vote against its ticket. That
would be the logical outcome of his presentation of
facts proving that the convention was dominated by
the representatives of corporations who were untrue
to their constituents. However, Mr. Bryan does not
take that view nor give that advice. On the con
trary, he urges his followers to repudiate the platform
but support the ticket.
In defense of that crooked method of doing poli
tics he says the reorganizers, after capturing the
convention and setting aside the Kansas City doc
trines, were afraid to nominate a reorganizer for
Governor, and adds: "If they had nominated one
of their own kind his candidacy on such a platform
would have aroused widespread protest, but instead
of that they place the party standard in the hands of
Hon. J. B. Sullivan, one of the ablest and stanchest
of the silver Democrats, whose county and Congres
sional district made a gallant fight for reaffirmation.
Judge Caldwell and the other nominees were also
faithful to the party in 1896. The Democrats of Iowa
have therefore to choose, between a good ticket on a
cowardly platform partly good and a Republican
ticket running on as bad a platform as could well be
conceived. What should they do? Vote for Sullivan
and his associates .on the ticket, but continue to
fight for Kansas City platform principles."
As it is unquestionable that the nominee for Gov
ernor has formally accepted the platform on which
he was nominated, it is not easy to sec how Mr.
Bryan can still look upon him as a stanch supporter
of the Kansas City programme. He must be a very
duplex sort of a politician if he can run with the Bry
anites while standing with the reorganizers. The
voters of Iowa will doubtless be keen enough to take
note of the fact, and the country will take note that
according to Mr. Bryan the corporations have in
vaded the . Democratic camp and captured the works.
It will be worth while recalling that next year.

The world has moved rapidly in a hundred and
twenty-seven years. Now every nation rejects negro
slavery, makes the slave trade piracy and forbids that
man shall be a chattel. The Jew is free of disability
everywhere except in Russia and the small buffer
states of Southeastern Europe. His emancipation
from all disability has become the humane issue of
this century. It has been accentuated by the horrors
of Kishenev, as the opposition to the slave trade was
by the horrors of the middle passage. Public opinion
in many nations has found voice, but nowhere mofe
emphatically than in the United States. The inten
tion of the President under certain conditions to send
a protesting petition of the people to the Russian
Government was necessary to make the Czar aware
of the force of public opinion here.
The petition is not yet in the hands of the Presi
dent, and no diplomatic exchange concerning it has
occurred. But the Czar has heard the voice of
America and has heeded it, even as this country heard
and heeded the voice of the British abolitionists.
Such justice as is found in Russia has been put in
motion. The public authorities who winked at mur
der in Kishenev have been put under arrest and sev
eral hundred of the murdering members of the blood
thirsty mob ?.re in prison. Russia will not hesitate to
sacrifice them if it be necessary to set herself right
in the opinion of the United States.
Going thus far, she will see farther than she goes.
The massacre was the direct and legitimate out
growth of the disability of the Jews under Russian
law. Whenever a class in any country is put under
legal disability, denied the power to order its place of
abode or to defend itself and its property by legal
means on equal footing with others, it is exposed to
such outrages as that in Bessarabia, which startled
the world. In punishing the murderers Russia is
punishing acts of which the Government is the
cause.
There is no escaping the logic of this statement.
If she punish the effect without removing the cause
she further endangers her authority over her ortho
dox subjects, who are moving uneasily and are rest
less and discontented from the Crimea to the Neva.
Public opinion has found the crease in her armor of
self-righteous autocracy, and President Roosevelt,
representing the people of the United States, has al
ready accomplished the whole effect of presenting a
protest that is not yet in his hands.
The widespread expression of public opinion in this
country against Russian treatment of the Jews fur
nishes another impressive instance of the same kind.
At the time of our Declaration of Independence
every kingdom, principality and power* of any im
portance sanctioned negro slavery. The negro was
believed to be appointed by nature to that sort of
subjection, and the fact that it was the only race
that patiently endured chattelhood was declared to
be evidence that it was divinely ordained to that con
dition. At. the same time the Jew was everywhere
held under some form of disability more or less gall
ing. In his case, too. Scripture was quoted, and he
suffered for the tragedy on Calvary.
THE United States once sanctioned slavery; as
a "domestic institution" in the States. From
; the time that John Quincy Adams defended
the right of the people to petition Congress for its
abolition slavery became the controlling factor in
American politics. The issue was intensified by the
Wilmot proviso and the compromise of 1850. But
from the beginning of the abolition and free soil
movement this country was powerfully affected by
the public opinion of Great Britain. Wilberforce had
led humane England against the slave trade, which
he denounced as "the sum of all villainies,'* and the
movement, which began as a protest against the im
portation of. negro slaves into the jurisdiction* of
Great Britain, had been supplemented by the genius
of universal emancipation, until it could be the boast
of Englishmen that the shackles fell from awlave
when his foot touched British soil.
The Duchess of Sutherland and other English abo
litionists were en rapport constantly with the abo

an Englishman, who came here to join the

Gerrit Smith, the Lovejoys and other American
champions of freedom. In modern history, and per
haps in all history, it was the most striking example
of the force of public opinion in one nation moving
public opinion and finally governmental action in

Neither of the reports is sufficiently serious to be
deemed "alarming," for in each case the cry of com
ing war has been heard so frequently that the world
no longer gives much heed to it. Nevertheless the
incessant repetition of such reports is in itself a proof
of the unsettled and uncertain condition of affairs in
North China and in the Balkans. So. long as those
conditions remain we shall never be sure of peace for
as much as a year ahead, and the recurring rumors
serve to remind us that there are still in the world
of international politics a number of active volcanoes
liable to break forth with violence at almost any
unexpected time. .

COLD KILLS THE GERM.
Lieut. Ferry Says There Are No Bald
Heads in the Arctic Region.
The people who come back from Klon-
dike testify to the fact that no native
bald heads are there. The Â¦ evidence is
that the cold climate kills the germs that
eat the hair off at the root. Lieutenant
Perry, who went to the Arctic regions,
gives the ""* same evidence. Newbro's
Herpicide has the same effect as the cold
climate. It kills the germ -that eats the
hair off at the roots, and the hair grows
again. Herpicide is the flret hair rem-
edy built upon the principle of destroying
the germ that eats the hair off.i Its phe-

The evidence was to the effect that the
night was calm and clear, that the Cas
tle Rock was lying at anchor In the
straits and that the Onisbo ran into her
at full speed. The bow watchman on the
steamer reported to the pilot that there
was a ship ahead In the stream. Jarvis
swore that he saw the ship 400 feet away
and that he tried to port the helm, but
the helm refused to work and the steamer
at full speed collided with the ship.
The inspectors found Jarvis guilty of
negligence and unskillful ness. The follow
ing occurs in their opinion: "Had he
stopped and backed his engines at full
speed instead of going on full speed ahead
he would have avoided the collision."
The license of Pilot William C. Jarvis

Chestnut street lies on a slab in the
Morgue, poisoned.
Little Gluseppl, for that was the name
his parents gave him, was only S days
old, and the doctor had prescribed syrup
of rhubarb for him. On Sunday after
noon Mrs. Susa Sansamino, a good-heart
ed neighbor who had been nursing Mrs.
Lirata, was requested by the mother to
give the baby a dose of rhubarb. Mrs.
Sansamino mistook a small vial of lysol
for the rhubarb and gave tha baby half a
teaspoonful of it. The child went into
convulsions and before the doctor could
be called it had died.
The vial containing the lysol was la
beled "For External Use Only" and the
word "Poison" was written with pen and
Ink, but the requisite death's head and
crossbones were missing. The shock has
made the condition of the mother very

Isaac Selby, the Australian minister,
who a few days ago filed a suit for $25,
000 damages against Donald McRac, a
furniture dealer, for alienation of Selby's
wife's affections, will have a chance to
answer a few charges himself within a
short time. Yesterday his wife, Theresa
Beatrice Selby, to whom he was married
at Auckland In 1SS6, and whose affections
Selby claimed were won by McRae, filed
a suit for divorce against him, charging
him with cruelty. She not only asks for
a divorce, but for the custody of their
three children, whose ag*-s are 14, 13 and
11 years, and for monthly alimony.
But one charge is made by Mrs. Selby
based upon the suit for damages brought
by Selby against McRae. She says that
the filing of the suit has caused her the
keenest mental agony and charges that it
is the result of Fplte on the part of her
husband. In connection with this she
cays that for years Selby has worried,
traduced and menaced her by his threats
to expose her to public shame and oblo
quy by exposing her alleged relations
with McRae. and that the suit Is but the
carrying out of her husband's plan to
cause her shame and suffering.
Helene E. Greer Is at a loss to account

leges she has had to undergo since her
husband's love turned to hate she has
sued for divorce. Her peace of mind has

fore asks the court to give her freedom.

slapped, choked, beat, cursed and abused
her. She asks for a divorce and $30 a

If Morrissey Is able to prove what he
claims he will have established a com
plete alibi and the authorities must look
further for Nelson's assailant.
Up till June 9 or 10 I was employed ae a
teamster for the firm of FarnÂ»worth & Ruggles,
on which date I wÂ«nt to Stockton and accepted
a Job on the ranch of J. C. Smith & Co..
â¢where I have bÂ«<?n employed every day until
I told Chief Walker my name and was placed
under arreit. Mr. Wilson, who U a foreman
on the ranch, came to see me while I wu In
Jail at Stockton and he telephoned to my father
to find out what I was charred with.
Mr. Wilson and all the ranch hands, and
also the company's books will show that I have
worked at the ranch steadily sine* June 11.
Ab to the Teamsters' Union card which was
found, I can't account for that, except that
when I left the employ of Farnsworth & Rug
gles, I left on my wagon an old coat and
overcoat, and It Is probable that I left th*
card In one of the pockets, as since my arrival
In Stockton I have been unable to find my old
card.
Morrissey will this morning be dressed
in the clothes left on the beach at the
time of the robbery and Nelson will make
another attempt to identify him.
Morrissey states that he Is Innocent and
that he Is prepared to prove an alibi.
Morrlssey's father visited him at the
Hall of Justice last night and the two
held a long conversation.
Morrissey made a statement last night,
as follows:
Nelson was immediately summoned to
the Hall of Justice for the purpose of
identifying the prisoner. After a close
examination Nelson indicated by shak
ing his head that he was unable to Iden
tify the man before him, but later stated
that he was not sure as to whether it was
tho right man or not, and asked that the
prisoner be dressed In the clothes which
were left on the beach by his assailant.
They went Immediately to the Hall of
Justice, where Morrissey was locked up
and his name placed on the detinue book.
Morrissey was dressed In a blue shirt
and a new suit of clothes. He wore his
hair close cropped, but otherwise his ap
pearance corresponded with the descrip
tion of the man Nelson claims he spent
the day with on the beach on June 13
last.
Detective Ed Gibson arrived in this city
last night from Stockton with Frank
Morrissey, who is suspected of having
assaulted and robbed Herman Nelson on
the ocean beach on June IS last.
Kelly 6tates further that last February
he demanded of the directors of the Sutro
Railroad Company that they take action
to prevent the giving of the properties
of the company into the control
of the United Kallroads, but that
no attention was paid to his de
mand. He eays further that he would
have railed a meeting of the stockholders
to protest against fuch action, but that he
felt it would be useless because the large
Â«tockhold*T8 were under the control of
the United Railroads.
Continuing, Kelly alleges: "That said
Sutro Railroad Company had no author
ity or power, either under the laws of the
State of California or under its articles of
incorporation or under the franchises
granted to it from the city and county of
San Francisco to sell or transfer its prop
erties or right* or privileges to the United
Railroads, or to sell at all; and that the
sale was and is void, and that the United
Railroads had no power or authority to
purchase the properties; that the acts of
the Sutro Railroad Company and of the
United Railroads are beyond and outside
the powers of each, either through their
boards of director* or through a majority
cf their stockholders or three-fourths of
their Btckholders; that by reason of said
unlawful acts the said railroad company
is in danger of losing its properties, fran
chises, privileges and rights, and is in
danger of having Its franchises forfeited
and taken from it, both from the State
and city, and by reason thereof the said
stock of the Sutro Railroad Company will
become worthless and of no value."
There iÂ» dissatisfaction among the mi
nority stockholders of the United Rail
roads, as vat etated in The Call a few
days apo. The appeal to the courts,
which, this paper etated would be the re
sult of the continued growls of the dis
gruntled ones, occurred yesterday, when
Joseph A. Kelly, a stockholder in the Su
tro Railroad Company, a corporation ab
sorbed by the United Railroads, filed a
euit to declare the sale of the road void
and for the restoration to the stockhold
ers of the "possession, use, control and
management of the Sutro Railroad Com
pany's franchise, properties and privi
leges." He asks that a receiver be ap
pointed to take charge of the road pend
ing the trial of the suit. The suit is
brought against the Sutter-street Railroad
Company and R. F. Morrow. Joseph L.
Schmitt, E. Durbrow. D. Friedenrich and
\Y. G. Morrow, its directors, and the
United Railroads.
Kelly, who own* twenty shares of stock
in the Sutro P-ailroad Company, bases his
suit on the action of the directors of the
company in transferring to the United
Rcllroad? the entire possessions of the
compj* Â¦Â¦'â¢ without the consent of the mi
nority s-.ockhoiders. He claims that such
action was void because of the failure to
secure a unanimous consent of the stock
holders. He alleges that the United Rail
roads is a foreign corporation, organized
for the purpose of monopolizing the street
railroad buslneFs of this city, and that in
accordance with such plan it combined
and confederated with the principal stock
holders of the Sutro Railroad Company to
bring about a transfer to the United Rail
roads of the possession of the Sutro Rail
road Company.
Kelly claims that the mere acquirement
of these possessions does not give to the
United Railroads the right to conduct a
street railroad in this city, and that the
corporation has, therefore, been conduct
ing its business without warrant or
authority from this city.
In support of his claim he alleges "that
the United Railroads did, for the purpose
of acquiring the Sutro Railroad Company
property, conspire with the principal
stockholders thereof and thus obtain con
trol of three-fourths of the stock of the
road, so that the eald road was under the
absolute control and guided by the will
of the United Railroads; that the said
holders of three-fourths of the stock
called a meeting, and at said meeting,
without obtaining the consent of the re
maining stockholders, voted to transfer
to the United Railroads the entire plant,
roMlnj? stock and possessions of the Sutro
road."

S. Eddy, the Saginaw lumber king. Col
onel Weir closed a deal a few weeks ago
wherein 2,500,000 acres of timber land ly
ing north of the city of Chihuahua passed
to their control. The property was owned
by the Garcia estate of the City of Mex
ico and is said to have been disposed of
to Weir at a comparatively low figure,
one that will yield to Morton, Eddy and
Weir a good sized fortune in the way of
profit when they decide to turn it over
to other parties. The land is heavily
wooded with white pine, yellow pine, ce
dar and a nondescript species of pine
commonly known as "black Jack." The
soil is rich and well watered .and when
It is eventually stripped of its wood it is
expected that it will become one of tho
richest regions in the republic for farm
ing purposes.
In order to make the tract available for
lumbering purposes its owners, according
to Colonel Weir, are already contemplat

board to elect McComb until further legal
advice had been given the board, so as
not to conflict with the recent decision
of Judge Sloss. The resolution of Corate
was therefore referred to, the' committees
on judiciary and finance.
The petition of the Lincoln Athletic
Club to hold a 'boxing contest at the

The delay In the repaying of Third
street was the most important subject
taken up yesterday by the Board of Su
pervisors.
Last week a complaint was filed by
property owners and business men on
that street calling the attention of the
Supervisors to the bad condition of the
thoroughfare. The matter was referred
to th6 Committee on Streets and that
body made its report yesterday.
Supervisor Braunhart said he had been
in communication with the Board of Pub
lic Works and that body had Informed
him that the United Railroads Company
was mainly responsible for the condition
of the street in question. Tho Board of
Public Works had written to the officials
of the United Railroads calling their at
tention to the fact that the corporation
had not made its improvements on the
street in the time stipulated.
To a request by the Board of Publio
Works that the railroad company send a
reply as to when it would finish its work
no answer had been sent.

Since his arrival in San Francisco the
Embassador has evinced a deep interest
In our methods of cold storage and has
asked those who have been attending him
on his trip* to furnish him with all the
information they possess regarding the
subject and especially as to the methods
in vogue on the transportation lines for
the handling of perishable products.
Italy, as is the case with France, Is
far behind the balance of the world, and
particularly the United States, in Its re
frigerating customs and it is thought
that the Embassador, realizing this fact,
Is making a study of our methods with
a view of preparing a report to his Gov
ernment on, the matter.
It is his intention to give a public re
ception Saturday evening at Washington
Square Hail between the hours of S and
10. when he will be pleased to meet his
countrymen.
WILL GIVE RECEPTION.
The Embassador returned yesterday af
ternoon from his visit to Astl vineyard,
where he showed a marked interest In
the progressiveness of the Italian-Swiss
colony and expressed himself as well
pleased with the hospitality shown him
by those who undertook to entertain him
during his stay there. To-day he expects
to attend the celebration of the Fall of
the Castile as the guest of the French
Consul-General.
In a few days the Embassador's sover
eign is to visit France as the guest of
President Loubet and in view of this ap
proaching event his excellency regards
It as a pleasant privilege to join with
the members of the local French colony
in celebrating a day which all French
men loyally observe.
Asked last evening as to how long he
expects to remain In San Francisco the
Embassador replied that he contemplated
making a stay of at least ten days, dur
ing which he hopes *to visit the typical
little Rome, known as Black Diamond,
hear Martinez, San Jose and Stockton
and possibly the University of California
at Berkeley and Stanford University at
Palo Alto, for he Is deeply interested in
all American Institutions, particularly
those of an educational character.
Among the speakers of the evening
will be Mayor Schmitz, who will formally
greet the distinguished visitor on behalf
of the city, Major-General MacArthur,
Count Grimanl. Italian Consul; Dr. Paolo
de Vecchl; G. Almagla, editor of 1/ Italia,
and possibly Governor Pardee, who has
been invited but up to a late hour last
evening had not notified the committee
of his acceptance.

Mayor des Planches, Italian Embassa
dor at Washington, will be the guest of

ST. LOUIS ENTRIES
' A dispatch received by Captain Martin
las^ night from Detective Thomas L.
Ryan, who Is in Tacoma, contained the
information that he would soon start for
this city- with George Roberts. Roberts,
who Is a bunko man, was arrested In this
city on a charge of grand larceny, and
after a preliminary examination was
bound over to the Superior Court, bonds
being fixed at 11000 by Judge Cabaniss.
Upon the calling of the case in the upper
court he failed to put in an appearance.
A bench warrant was Issued for his ar
rest and he was located in Seattle. De
tective Ryan was sent to the northern
city to bring him back. Roberts took ad
vantage of every technicality to resist ex
tradition. Several weeks ago the officer
started for this city with his prisoner,
but upon arriving at Tacoma he was
stopped by two deputy sheriffs, who took
the prisoner from him by virtue of a writ
of habeas corpus.
Detective Ryan has been in the north
ern country for more than two months
In an endeavor to bring back Roberts,
and during that time has made several
trips to Olympla and appeared before the
Supreme Court on several occasions. It
appears that the northern officers placed
every obstacle in his way to prevent him
taking the bunko man and the local po
lice are much gratified to hear that he
will be speeding southward soon.

The San Jose Is a sister boat to the
Terba Buena and was built with the last
named at the yards of John Dickie on tha
estuary. She is 200 feet long with a tvam
of 53 feet and a draft of lOVa feet. There
are two decks for passengers on the San
Jose and the cabins are fitted up to com
fortably accommodate 2000 passengers.
It Is expected that the San Jose and
Terba Buena, which is yet to have- her
trial trip, will not go into service until
September or possibly October, when the
San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland
Railroad calculates to have its new ferry,
line In operation. The builder and own
ers of the San Jose feel certain that she
will be able to make the trip from the
San Francisco slip to the Emeryville pier
slip In twelve minutes when the bearings
of her machinery Is worn smooth.
Among those aboard during the trial
trip were Isaac L. Requa, W. Q. llen

teemed as an educator and his reputation
Is worldwide, but the instruction he gives
Is almost all theoretical. It Is understood
that some effort will be made to Induce
Mr. Heaton to remain and take charge at
the proposed new practice department.
If the university does not succeed in
getting a practice school or retaining Mr.
Heaton, it can blame it all to that ancient
rivalry with the normal schools which
culminated In a set of rules restricting
the students and powers of each. With
President Wheeler, Professor Elmer E.
Brown. Irving Stringham, Frederick
Slate, W. A. Merrill, A. F. Lange and K.
C. Babcock on the university side and
Frederic L. Burk, E. T. Pierce. C. C. Van
Liew and S. T. Black on the normal

look upon an absorbing warfare, of which
no man can foretell the end, for each Is
out for the humiliation and death of the
other.

OLD-TIME RIVALRY.
Having children taught by fledglings,
however, is not such a terrible thing,
after all. In places In this State where
there are normal schools the parents pre
fer to send their children to them, as they
are supposed to receive more individual
attention than in thÂ« ordinary public
school. The teaching is all carried on un
der the supervision of capable instructors,
so there would be no danger of half
hearted work:
there would certainly be a great protest
from that Quarter.
OAKLAND, July 13.â General R. H.
Warfield has eventually won his suit
against M. F. Cochrane, assignee of the
estate of Colonel P. A. Finigan of Berke
ley. A remlttltur was received to-day
from the Supreme Court reversing the de
cision of the lower court, from which
Warfield appealed.
The origin of the suit goes back to the
summer of 1S97. Lillian. Maud and Mary,
the daughters of the colonel, spent the
season at the Hotel Rafael and their bill
was (3000. About this time Finigan was
forced to go through insolvency. The
colonel deeded valuable lots to his daugh
ters and they in turn deeded them to
Warfleld in payment of his claim. Coch
rane demanded the realty for the cred
itors and alleged that the transfer of the
lots to a preferred creditor wag illegal.
His contention was sustained by the low
er* court, but was reversed by the Su
preme Court.
Lengthy Litigation Over Berkeley
Lots Is Ended by Supreme
Court Decision.
WARFIELD GETS LAND.
FROM FINIGAir~ESTATE
There are two good reasons why the
Berkeley School Department does not
want to give up one of Its schools. One is
that it will mean the dismissal of ten or
twelve teachers in that school and there
would certainly be an uproar over that
proposition. The other is that the parents
do not like the idea of their children be
ing practiced on by mere students and
and his confreres are a good deal worried
about it. The trouble is there seems to be
no school available for the purpose. The
university people hoped to get one of the
schools of the Berkeley School Depart
ment, but Superintendent S. D. Waterman
frowned when it was suggested to him.
so they withdrew temporarily to look
around some more. If the university
authorities can prevail upon the Berkeley
School Superintendent and the School Di
rectors to grant this privilege they will
6elect the Dwight School.

The woman was removed to the County
Jail this afternoon and will occupy the

detention that confines Walkirez. The
murderer has declared he would like to
marry Mrs. Ross. But there is an in
surmountable barrier to such a culmina
tion in the form of a statute against mis
cegenation.
Mrs. Ross represented herself during
the trial this morning and declared she
was not a vagrant, but had been a hard
working woman. She vehemently and
vulgarly announced that Ehe had con
fessed to the knowledge of the Leroy
murder to save herself, but insisted she
would refuse to give any testimony at
Walkirez's trial that would assist the au
thorities In the prosecution of her negro
companion.
The testimony that convicted Mrs. Ross
was given by George Flood, the colored
machinist, and friend of Mrs. Elizabeth
I^eroy, who was strangled to death by
Walkirez. and Cephas Oliver, a colored
man who lived on the Leroy premises
while Mrs. Ross and Walkirez stayed

In speaking of the work of the solici
tors. President Rosenthal said:
We aiirwd to set a correct and uninfluenced
opinion from the south-side commuters
with respect to the removal or retention of the
Kates on the local trains. Every commuter
was politely asked to sign his name in the
for or against column. There are two sides
to the gate question and it was not our desire
to go before the City Trustees or the railroad
management with any petition that would
show but one side of the situation. The South
ern Pacific has made application for a re
newal of one franchise and for an original
franchise for a road which the company has
always operated without a franchise. The
applications are before the City Trustees and
are for fifty years each. ThÂ« matter is now
up to the peopfe for settlement and it is of
vital Importance to the future of Alameda
that It be settled rightly. This cannot be
done by attacking the Southern Pacific In
any way. The proper way to reach a com
promise or adjustment is for the parties to
both sides to meet and amicably arrue the
question, permitting each side to tell what it
wants and what it will give or concede. That
is the reason the Board of Trade arranged
the mass meeting for to-morrow eight. We
have no selected orator or exponents of our
sldÂ« of the matter. Everybody who desires to
express himself one way or another will be
accorded a considerate hearing.
There has already been one public dis
cussion of the matter before the West
End Improvement Club, at which a straw
vote of commuters Indicated that they
were opposed to the retention of train
gates at a ratio of five to one. Other
concessions, such as the replacing of two
stations on the south side road In their
original locations, the improvement of
the car service and the removal of the
old single track on Railroad avenue west
from Eighth street to Fifth street are
demanded by some in exchange for the
two franchises, but the privilege that
concerns all residents and which was sus
pended by the Southern Pacific at the
first of the present year, is that of free
travel. Local merchants claim that the
city was built up under the. free travel
service and that Its discontinuance is
now working to the detriment of business
interests. They are opposed to having
the City Trustees grant franchises to the
Southern Pacific Company for more than
five years and then only on condition
that residents be again given the benefit

ment of the commuters on the gate ques
tion this morning were President Henry
Rosenthal of the Board of Trade, T. F.
Baird, secretary-treasurer of the same

When the accident took place the vessel
was 1700 miles from Newcastle, 1500 miles

HONOLULU, July 13.â Judge Estee, in
the Federal Court, i has awarded - $2500
damages to Sinsfrcd Langaaa. a sailor of
the barkentine j James Taf t, because the
captain did not put into tho. nearest port

Honolulu was - over, 2000 miles . away, but no

this near port of Tahiti, although he had still
before him a three weeks' sail to Hawaii.

The other Interesting notice is to the effect
that the United States HydrogTaphlc office
has in view the publication of meteorological
charts of the South Atlantic and of the South
Pacific oceans similar in scope to the present
monthly pilot charts of the North Atlantic and
North Pacllie. The proposed charts will be
published quarterly Instead of monthly. The
llt-Et to appear will be a chart of the South
Atlantic 'or the winter months of 1003-04. This
will be ready lor distribution by November 1.
More *>o now than ever the Hydrotrraphic office
asks the co-operation of mariners, especially
captains of sailing ships, in the preparation of
these charts. Blank forms for recording: me
teoroloplcal observations will be supplied upon
application to the Navy Department, and In re
turn for this co-operation Uncle Sam will sup
ply the volunteer obpervers with the charts
free of charge and Irrespective of nationality.
The United States Hydroffraphlc offlce made
two announcements yesterday of considerable
Interest to navigators. The first was that a
revised edition of Bowdltch"s American Prac
tical Navigator has been prepared and is now
on sale at the different agencies of the Hy
droirraphlc office. This valuable work has bt-en
practically rewritten, the matter that had be
come obsolete having been eliminated and Its
place taken by explanations of some of the
readier methods of navigation in use at tho
present day. with tables for the same. Among:
ether Improvements the traverse table has

Hooper defies Hoibrook to prove his
charges a^d says he is fully prepared to
meet them.
That was eome months ago and it Ss
crJy now that the chanres have been
filed. It is eaid that the derreasÂ© in the
society's revenue has como*!'.*l Hoibrook
to file the charges. The society Is en
titled to a proportion of all fin*s and for
feitures and when Hoibrook applied to
the Board of Supervisors for a proportion
of those brought about by Hooper's ar
rests he was refused on the jrround that
the society had nothing to do with the
arrests.
The trouble between Hoibrook and
Hooper was rauEed by an anonymoua let
ter sent to the board of directors of the
society, reflecting upon Hoibrook'a wife
end the secretary's method of conii'jcthvr
the business of the society. Hoibrook
blamed Hooper for being the author of
the letter and demanded his removal from
the society. Chief Wlttman removed
Hooper, but declined to assign another
officer to the society till Hoibrook pre
ferred formal charges against H&oper be
fore the Police Commissioners and proved
them.
HOOPER IS DEFIANT.
It Is alto alleged that while Hooper has
been detailed ca similar work by Chief
W'lttman he has been openly hostile to
the society and in proof thereof It Is
shown that during the trial of DomlntCK
Shannon of the Injrleside Counlig Park,
charged with cruelty to animals. Hooper
Â¦web a witness for the defense and his
testimony virtually led to the fccquuial of
the defendant.
One Instance in particular is given.
From June, ZS39. to December. 1902, Hooper
furnished eighty-three reports of crippled
horses In a wagon of which the license
number was 11.S36, when, as a matter of
fact, the wagon In question had been out
nf commlsslcn for two years prior to De
cember. 1X12. During the same period, it
Is alleged, there were eighty-nine cases
reported In connection with wagons with
thÂ« final figures "S36."
HOLBBOOK'S ALLEGATIONS.
Some sensational developments are ex
pected at the meeting of th* Police Com
missioners to-r.icht, when the charges
preferred by Secretary Hoibrook of the.
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals against Policeman W. T. Hooper,
formerly attached to the society, are
heard. The complaint filed by Hoibrook
bristles with startling allegations. Most
cf them, however, had been made pre
viously to the board of directors of the
society.
The complaint, eunor.g other things, al
leges that Hooper for the three years
prior to severing his connection with the
society falsified his reports with the ob
ject of showier that he was doing his
usual amount of work, whereas he was
cpendlr-g his time at the race tracks in
this city and Oakland and in the pool
room* at Sausalitn.
It was also announced yesterday by the
Southern Pacific Company that hereafter
two funeral trains will operate dally be
tween this city and the burial grounds In
San Mateo County in order to meet the
requirements of the San Francisco public,
which is now compelled to Journey to the
adjoining county toj perform the last iltes
over their dead. The first train will leave
the city at 11 o'clock in the morning and
the eecond at 2:30 In the afternoon. They
will run as far as San Bruno, where they
wt}l turn around on the "Y" : shaped
track. A wait there of three-quarters of
an hour will be made to permit the final
ceremonies at the graves. These new
trains will stop at the Valencia-street sta
tion. .
E. D. Thomas, auditor of the North
Shore *road, has resigned his position and
yesterday Manager Rank announced the
appointment of his successor in the per
son of Oscar F. Glffln Jr.
The company has not abolished the station
altogether, but has Issued orders that through
trains â the New Orleans, the Del Monte flyer,
the Coast Limited and live others â pass on
without stopping at Valencia street. Increase-1
traffic has of course made the trains heavier,
and It Is with difficulty that they are stopped
and started again at this station, for there is
a 'wade between there and San Bruno, aver
aging ninety feet, and just beyond the station,
coming this way, the grade encountered Is over
110 feet, which Is hard to overcome with a big
train, especially when it Is remembered that
the greater portion of the track from Valen
cia street eastward- to Third and Townsend
streets Is curved. For the convenience of com
muters who live In 'the vicinity of the Valencia
street station an.i work in the city or down the
road, we have arranged to have certain trains
stop In the morning and In tho evening. Th*
change will, not affect the traveling public
other than to bring passengers Into the regular
depots on time.
A notice waa issued yesterday by the
passenger department of the j Southern
Pacific Company to the effect that here
after the Valencia-street station will not
be a general stopping point for trains and
that the sale of tickets there has been
abandoned. General Passenger Agent T.
H. Goodman, referring to the change,
said that it had been found necessary by
reason of the increased trafflo and the
fact that stops made there resulted In de
lays to the regular trains, which tended
to demoralize the schedule. He said fur
ther:
THE Occidental and Oriental
Steamship Company's Doric,
which arrived Sunday night from
the Orient, . docked early yesteiv
day and landed her passengers at
the Pacific Mail dock. Â£Jhe brought 31S7tf
tons of cargo, which included 23,154 boxes
of tea and 2SC bales of silk.
During the last three days ol the voy
age heavy head winds were encountered,
but the weather was exceptionally fine
for all the rest of the trip. Among the
passengers was Goodman King of St.
Louis, who has been in Japan as a com
missioner from the St. Louis Exposition.
Several missionaries returned on the
Doric and a number of globe-trotters
bound for England were among the paa-
Eengers. Dr. E. Sisson of this city re
turned on the Doric from an Oriental
tour.
The pasrengers were:
Dr. Gaorire W. Betr, Mrs. Georie W. Betz,

Receipts of new Potatoes were heavy end
as there was no demand for shipping the mar

all around. As usual a few lots of strictly
fancy ripe stock commanded a small premium
over the quotations. Trading In old Burbanlc9
was light and prices were unchanged. The
steamer due from Oregon to-day will bring
about 1400 sacks. Onions were In ample sup
ply and yellow were fairly steady at the pre
vlorsly quoted rates.
Changes In 'vegetables were, slight. Summer
Squash, Cucumbers and Tomatoes continued
to move freely at 6teady prices and Peas and
Asparagus cleaned up quickly at previous quo
tations. Green Corn was steady for good
stock, but i>oor and wormy stock, which was
in free supply, was hard to dispose of. String
Beans and Green Peppers were generally weak
and only the very best offerings received any

No new developments were reported from Eu
rope. The local market was flat; dealers had
practically no demand from brewers, and as a
consequence they were slow buyers, claiming
there was nothing In the situation to warrant
purchases."

CHICAGO, July 13. â Wheat, after a strong
opening to-day, ruled for the greater part of
the session weak and the close was at a de
cline of 24@2%c. Â¦ Corn, though showing some
strength early, reflected the weakness in
wheat and closed with a loss of l'&l'tc. Oats
were down %c and provisions showed a loss
of 224Â©50c.
Firm cables caused strength in wheat at
the opening but lt did not hold long. Septem
ber showed a gain of Â»*<&4c at 7;Â»-*<ft.sii 1. Â¦ an
high point for the day. and Immediately
slumped of! on selling by some of the large
commission houses influenced by good grow
ing weather throughout the country and bear
ish construction placed on the Government re
port. Local long holders followed the lead,
and before the selling was over September had
touched 76%c. A slightly better tone devel
oped near the close, but wlfh a small cash
demand and increasing receipts, there was not
much recovery and the close was weak at 7OTs
@78c. a net loss of 24@'2%c.
There was ronsiderable weakness In corn,
due to free gelling by local traders on reports
of good weather and on the easier cables.
The opening on the early strength In wheat
was unchanged to 4c higher at fil%Â©51%c.
with a firm tone and at times there was fairly
good support to the market, but in the face
of the weakness In wheat, a steady decline took
place. September selling down to 604c and
closing weak at 504Q5o%o. a loss of lQl^c.
Country offerings were quite liberal with buf
little support.
Oats were lower In sympathy with corn and
wheat, but there was some good buying in de
ferred futures and prices suffered but little.
The crop situation prevented much selling and
the cash demand was light. September closed
* t c loÂ«-er after ranging between 34 V*,c and
34 a -;*|34"Â»,c, the opening figures.
Local traders bought provisions on the break,
but the buying had little strengthening in
fluence. A big run of hogs and lower prices
at the yards caused a break In the market
and the close showed a net loss for Septem
ber pork of SiOc. while lard was down 274Â°
and ribs 224"!?25c. Stocks are increasing and
the demand shows little improvement.

Prices of Grapes had a wider range and moved

"I suppose, colonel," remarked a citizen
to the. president of the Ice company one
cold morning last winter, "that you n-on't
charge us so much tor our ice next sum
mer as you did last. You're getting a
tremendous crop." "We may have to
charge more." stiffly replied the president.
"Think of the trouble and expense In
volved In cutting ice three feet thick!"â

< Butter opened the week, at a further slight
advance. The floors were kept reasonably
clean by a steady demand, and nobody had an

The directors of the California Retail
Grocers' and Merchants' Association have
appointed a committee to take the pre
liminary stepa to establish a mutual fire
insurance company In this State, in which
the merchants will be largely concerned.
At the last session of the Legislature a
bill was presented and went through both
houses concerning mutual fire insurance,
but It was pocketed by the Governor. It
is now proposed by the merchants who
were back of the measure Introduced in
the Legislature to proceed under the gen
eral Insurance law of the State.
The committee referred to will suggest
the names of the first board of directors
of the new company. On the committee
are: Joseph A. Stulz. president of the
California Retail Grocers' and Merchants'
Association; T. H. Corcoran, president of
the local retail grocers; R. H. Warfleld,
Frank H. Gould and W. F. Burbank. The
committee has been instructed to have
hardware, drugs and other branches of
business represented on -the first direc
tory.
The paid up capital of the new company*
will be $200,000, divided into 2000 shares of
the par value of $100 each. The stock will
bo placed with retail merchants all over
the' State, so say the promoters of the
new company.
The nomination of the first directors
probably will be made this week- TnÂ«
committee is busy interviewing prominent
business men to secure their active sap
port. One purpose of the new company,
as stated by those concerned. Is to insure
properties of its members, but a general
Insurance business is also proposed, to be
confined to California.
The only contest of the meeting was on
the election Â»of treasurer, and that sim
ply applied to the question of compensa
tion attaching to the office. Several di
rectors maintain that the policy adopted
by the board of 'regents of the State Uni
versity In designating a treasurer and
authorizing a bank to conduct the finan
cial business without expense to the Insti
tution should be- adopted by the Veterans'
Home.' The ballot on nominees for treas
urer was secret, but In the discussion at
tending the contest Directors Loop and
Burke opposed the payment of $1300 per
year, or any other sum as salary of the
treasurer. Directors . Bllnn and Ruddick
spoke in favor of continuing the compen
sation of the treasurer.
On tha first ballot the vote stoodâ C.
Mason. Klnne, 5; James K. Wilson. 5.
The second ballot stoodâ Klnne. 5; Wil
son, 4, and one blank. The chair ruled
that Colonel Kinne was elected treasurer.
Mr. Wilson had no information that he
would be voted for. but Director Loop
assured the board that the San Francis
co National Bank, of which Mr. Wilson
Is president, or the Bank of California
would perform the duties of treasurer
without expense to the home.
George W. Strohl of Napa County, who
was recently appointed to the board by
the Governor, took his seat. Officers of
the board and of the home were re-elect
ed as follows: President, Samuel W.
Backus; vice president, W. J. Ruddick;
secretary? John F. Sheehan; treasurer,
C. Mason Klnne: commandant. George W.
Walts; adjutant, C. B. Graham; medical
director, Dr. W. F. McAllister; assistant

The board of directors of the Veterans'
Home of California met yesterday and
opened proposals for a new Corliss en
gine for the power plant and for laundry
machinery. The bids were referred to the
building: and grounds committee. S. J.
Loop, chairman, and the chief engineer,
Ray D. Clark, to determine the lowest
offer.

which are contained In the Mershon^af

false in its meaning and many of the
facts, particularly those which reflect
upon him are entirely without founda

that- he would : welcome any â¢ investigation
Into the charges against him contained

"'Why don't you tell your brother

he .would "advise Mr. 'Mershon to go to

Mr; Mershon should not go- under any
circumstances; that people were trying
to make him (Mershon) appear a fugitive

"Mary- Donnelly, being duly sworn de
poses and says: My name'js Mary Don

hereinafter mentioned, at- 106 . Devisadero
street. San Francisco, California. I have
known James R. T. Mershon for several
years last ' past. : I also : know by sieht
Frank- Schmitz and the brother of J Mc-

spent some parts of. several. days, to wit
May 1 and May 2, at my said' residence, 106
Devisadero street, so as to avoid report
crs. â¢* v Â¦ . , .
In corroboration of this latter statement
Mrs. Mary Donnelly, who .occupies the
premises at 106 Devisadero street has
made the following affidavit: < ' "
"State of Carlifornia, County of Placer,
On Saturday, May 28, 1903, X was
arain at 106 Devioadero street, wher*
Frank Schmitz called on ma at about 11
a. m. I then accused tttm of giving a
copy of the question* and answers he
had furnished me to Blakeley, and
Prank Schmlta then and there admitted
he had done Â«o, but he aald that Dough

I did this thlnar tha Mayor will run ma
out of the State and disown ma."
In the same affidavit Mershon swears
as follows:
MERSHON'S CHARGES.
If we can't hush this matter up my
( brother will make me send in my resigna
tion and drive me out of the State." Mrs
Mershon claim3 to have been present at
the interview and corroborates her hus
band's statement.
bers of the Grand Jury state that this In
vestigation will not be smothered for po
litical reasons and that if the results of
the inquiry warrant It criminal prosecu
tions will be instituted against those who
are found to be culpable In the affair.
Former President Mershon of the be
smirched commission, whose resignation
was forced by Mayor Schmitz when the
scandal first became public property, is
making every effort to Justify himself and
throw the onus of the transaction upon
the Mayor and his brother Frank- In his
affidavit Mershon charges that on April 27
Frank Schmitz came to his house and
during the course of a conversation last-
Ing an hour said to him:
- "Bad* luck \ followed, j We mortgaged our
home; and lost It. Then I commenced to
sell my, jewels. 1 ;.My ) $8000 diamond neck
lace," which my, mother gave me/Iipawn
ed for $1200. as. I had hoped to redeem It,
although Mr. Shreve had offered to buy
it for $5000. Little by little everything
went, . and - now we-lare worse than ; pen
niless. My husband ..was always good
ness itself to'me, 'and we all .love him
dearly. My oldest son Is 13. He has just
had, the misfortune to cut off the i end of
his flngerl My, youngest ; boy, ; Emanuel,
is 11, \ and . helps me as much as ! he; can.
â¢ "My! husband is" a' member 'of the Uni
versal Order . of < Knight Commanders i of
the", Sun, and here are the orlglnarparch
ments granted him. , I think he was also
one of the charter members of ; the Bo
hemian Club.' If-is a'very'sad ending to
the . life of a man .with a brilliant I brain,'
with : accomplishments and ; with" so gen
erous and kind a heart for all his friends.
"We have been very unfortunate.. When
I came from Paris, â¢ fourteen years ago, I
brought $60,000 ? with Â¦ me and used it Â¦ In
paying . property here: and then built . a
beautiful home in' Berkeley. . All * went
rwell until General Ezeta, persuaded. us. to
go Into his San Salvador scheme, -and. he
was :;so* persuasive Â«~ that we put in
$40,000â and we lost every^ cent ;'of It. ;
RUINED BY I SPECULATION.
Mrs. Wells, who Is -a highly educated
and refined Parisian,' Is broken hearted
over the thought of his position." She said
with tears streaming down her pale face:
"I do not care for .myself; I am' young
and can work* for. my, two boys, -but to
think that my v . husband's friends should
allow him to become a burden to, the city
is almost more than. I can bear.r When
we were in deep distress, -surrounded, by
poverty and sickness, ;i- wrote to several
of his former wealthy, old-time and inti
mate friends In the Bohemian â¢'. Club \ to
come to his relief with food and metilcal
attendance, but not one of. them replied.'
I did , not ask for â¢ anything for myself,
only for him, - and that â¢ appeal . they Â¦ re
fused him. To-day he fainted f cur times
on the way to the. hospital, and- when I
left him he was almost, unconscious. Oh!
I do not want him to die" there. Don't you
think someof" his; old friends.. will do
something for him- and put him into a pri
vate sanitarium/ where his last hours can
be sj>ent? - - Â£ .-'---Â¦ . ' -..., .. ..;... j
Two months ago, to save the family
from actual starvation, Mrs. Wells took a
position as housekeeper at the Vienna
Lodging-house, 533 Broadway, where, with
their two young sons, she was just
enabled to make enough to keep the wolf
from the door. As she had to do the en
tire work of twenty rooms and also cook
ing for the. family, she had no time to
give her husband the constant nursing
that his case . required, but was by his
side whenever she could steal a, moment
from her work.
GOES TO^COUUTY HOSPITAL.
Yesterday afternoon when the ambu
lance came to take Wells away he said:
"I hope there won't be a crowd to see
me put Into the ambulance, as I ; don't
want the people to see me m this poverty
stricken condition." This -<vas too" much
for his wife to bear, and. she borrowed J2
from some kind neighbors, a hack was
procured and the -sufferer was, carried
down the rickety stairs and placed in; it
His wife and sons accompanied him, to the
hospital and made him as corrlfortabfe
there as possible and then bade him fare
well and returned to 1 their humble lodg
ings. . * .â¢ ' ,- Â¦ ,. "*""1
Broken in spirit, sick nigh unto death,
his arms paralyzed,'. his mind partially de
ranged from his sufferings, he was com
pelled to seek the only relief at hand and
become a ward of the city. His faithful
wife has struggled nobly -during his four
months' illness. He has. been during all
that time entirely, helpless, the result of
five apoplectic shocks.
FRANCIS ' MABJON WELLS,
sculptor, litterateur, club member
and well-known man abcut town,
was forced by dire illness and
strain of circumstances to apply
for admission to the City and County Hos
pital yesterday. He is now lying there in
a helpless and pitiable state. Not one
single friend came to him In his distress,
although when in affluent circumstances
his beautiful home and grounds at Berke
ley were filled with those who enjoyed the
royal hospitality that they were always
welcome to there. *
The total amount of money embezzled
by dishonest employes during 1902 in the
United States and Canada reached , the
enormous amount of $6,933,516.
Among other works are the bears over
the entrance to the First National Bank,
which have marked merit in conception
and' design.
He also. did some artistic modeling for
the Hibernia Bank, which adds much to
the beauty of that handsome structure.
The great owl which stands at the top
of the grand ' stairway of the Bohemian
Club is also of his handiwork. Other
work which has been highly commented
upon adorns St. Ignatius Church, the
quadrangle and the memorial chapel at
Stanford University.
He was born in Louisiana, his father be
ing General Francis Marion Wells, but he
was educated In the eastern part of Penn

SCULPTOR OF LIBERTY.
Marlon Wells, as he was called, has
been well known here for many years and
has been one of the most prominent
sculptors In the city. His statue of Lib
erty on the dome of the City Hall Is a
fine piece of work and a monument to his
abilities. The figure Is modeled from his
wife and the poise is extremely graceful.
The bas relief of John Lick, which was
executed at the request of the Lick trus
tees, and now hangs In the Pioneer Hall,
is a splendid likeness of the great phil
anthropist. The John Marshall monu
ment In Sonora County, erected to com
memorate the first discovery of gold In
California, also exhibits great talents.
That body purposes sifting the scandal
thoroughly with a view to placing the re
sponsibility for this grave breach of offi
cial trust where it belongs. The mem-
he specifically charges Mayor Eugene
E. Schmltz and his brother, Frank
Schmitz, with complicity in the disclosure
of questions intended to be used In the
examination of candidates for the Fire
Department, the Grand Jury has decided
to undertake a thorough examination of
the matter.

down by the trustees to three sets: These arÂ»

Smith, professor of sociology at Stanford
University. Is discussing them with, the best
authorities, and having them perfected.' .
Should the funeral take place here it
would be strictly private and would be
attended by only the immediate relatives
of the deceased.
Mr. and Mrs. Rickard lost.no time in
making up their mind and at once de
cided to go East.
As to whether the family will bring the
remains for Interment to this city will
all depend upon consultations which Mrs.
Rickard will have with her late father's
friends In Montreal. It is her Intention
to do whatever she may learn would have
been the wish of the doctor. If she finds
that It was her father's desire to ' be
burled In San Francisco the body will be
brought here without delay. Mrs. Rick
ard said that she could , not. say .very
much about the burial, the news being so
sudden. . .
The first intimation of the death of her
faher Mrs. Rickard said she learned in
the columns of yesterday's Call. Later,
she said, she received a telegram con
firming the news from her daughter,
who was with her grandfather,
Dr. McDonald, at the time of his
death. The telegram read: "Grandpa
dead. What shall I do?"
MAY BRING BODY HEBE.
"I feel proud of my father. My main
Idea is to vindicate him, because he was
a very good man. I am perfectly willing
to take upon my shoulders all the blame
for the failure of the banks. I claim
whatever I did was right and I would do
it again, no matter what the consequences
might be.
"I am the only surviving son. My
brother Frank died In London. My father
was a good man and has a record to be
proud of. I arranged with him that he
should have identification papers on him
in order that he might be taken cara of
in the event of his sudden death. There
was always a sum of money on hand to
pay his funeral expenses. He always
stayed at the Bath Hotel, Montreal. He
was very popular in Montreal. He had
many friends there. He was greatly in
terested in church work and was a mem
ber of the leading church there."
Richard McDonald Jr. is now engaged In
the practice of law in this city. He feels
greatly depressed over the death of his
parent. He denies that he was ever
estranged from him and said concerning
him:
The deceased was 83 years of age at the
time of his taking off. He was born In
Macksvllle, Ky.. on June 21, 1820. He
came to California in 1S49 and was a mem
ber of the Pioneer Society. H.e studied
medicine In St. Louis in 1843. He worked
his way Arough college and practiced
his profession with great success. Upon
his arrival In California he opened a drug
store in Sacramento and accumulated
quite a fortune out of patent medicines.
He was a leading Knight Templar and
was the oldest member of the order <n
the State. The money he accumulated by
the. sale of his patent medicines he put
into the Pacific Bank and for many years
was president of the institution. He was
a candidate for Governor on the Prohibi
tion ticket In 1SS3 and received â¢ 5000 votes.
He leaves surviving him besides his son
and daughter his brothers, Captain J. M.
McDonald, Marian Jasper McDonald, the
Park Commissioner, and Colonel Mark
L. McDonald of Santa Rosa.
But for. the publication in The Call of
the news of the death of Dr. R. H. Mc-
Donald, formerly president of the Pa
cific Bank of this city, his own children
and surviving brothers would not have
known yet of his demise. The exoluslve
publication of a dispatch from Montreal,
where the self-exiled capitalist spent the
last years 6f his life, telling of his taking
off, was read with a great deal of Inter
est by those who knew him.
As soon as the late Dr. McDonald's sur
viving daughter, Mrs. Mattle Rickard,
learned of her father's death she Imme
diately made preparations to leave for the
East and to take charge of the body. She
closed up her residence at Ross, Marin
County, and took the overland train for
New York last night. She was accom
panied by her husband. Richard H. Mc-
Donald Jr., the only son, is ready to leave
for .the East if he can do so in time to
attend his parent's funeral.
The son was greatly shocked over the
news. He telegraphed his sister yester
day morning to learn more about the
death of his father, but she was unable
to tell him more than that which ap
peared in yesterday's Call.

The novel plan of both sides agreeing
that they wt>uld presume that Patrick
Calhoun. who is now In New York, was
present In spirit at the proceedings and
had grlven his testimony was among the
incidents yesterday. Livernash and Moore
agreed to the fiction that Calhoun had
pone on the witness stand and answered
various questions regarding the opera
tion of the road and his relations with
Brown Bros, of New York. Moore sug
pested that if Calhoun was present in
person instead of in fiction he undoubt
edly would not answer any questions of
the character presented, but as he was
absent there was no trouble on this score,
and the incident was soon closed.
When the arbitration board meets one
cf the first points it will have to decide
will be the questions whether it is just
for the company to be compelled to show
its books and give testimony about its
earnings. If the arbitrators decide that
puch Questions must be answered Secre
tary Willcutr. President Holland and Pat
rick Calhoun will be called by Livernash
and asked to explain about the purchase
of the roads, the value thereof and other
financial questions pertaining to the cor
poration.
Livernash will call one witness this
mnrnlng and then close his case for- the
carmen. The I 'nited 'Railroads will open
in the afternoon session. It Is generally
known that the United Railroads In hand
ling its case will call but few witnesses
and wijl rely solely en figures and sta
tistics it has been gathering in Eastern
cities for months.
The filing cf these statements was vig
orously protested by Attorney Moore, on
behalf of the street car corporation.
The statements, however, were filed and
they will be among the documents the
three members of the board of arbitra
tion will be asked to examine.
E. J. Uvernash. on behalf of the Car
men'Â« Union, spent most of the time yes
terday in the arbitration proceedings in
filing affidavits and statements in support
of the fact that the cost of living has
materially increased in this city during
the last few months.
In the afternoon Livernash filed state
ments written by Rabbi J. NIeto, Hugh
Craig. William Greer Harrison. Judge J.
M. Seawell. Franklin K. Lane and E. A.
Walcott. These well known citizens, at
the request of Livernash, wrote their im
pression on the third demand of the
carmen, namely t that the wages of the
men is insufficient to properly maintain
them.
Frequent meetings of the executive
committee will be required from, thlÂ»
time until August 17 in order to keep
pace with accumulating business. Georga
Stone, chairman of the general commit
tee, advised the veterans on this topic at
the meeting last night.
Provision will be made at the Pavilion
for 5000 guests other than veterans of
the Grand Army. The fare will consist of
beans, hardtack, coffee, pipes and to
bacco. ./
Last night at a meeting of the executive
committee, Thirty-seventh National En
campment. Grand Army of the Republic,
the sum of ?5370 was set aside to pay the
expenses of three leading functions at
Mechanics' Pavilion durlngr encampment
week. These functions will be a camp-,
fire, reception and concert. Charles E.
Wilson, acting chairman of the enter
tainment committee, submitted an elabo
rate report containing an itemized state
ment of the cost of each feature. Owing
to the' absence in Europe ot Colonel
Charles H. Bllnn. chairman of the com
mittee, this work devolved upon Mr.
Wilson. The executive committee, by
unanimous vote, adopted the report an-1
appropriated the amount estimated as
necessary to carry out the plan of enter
tainment at the Pavilion. Colonel Bllnn
returned from Europe last Saturday and
will resume active operations on behalf
of the encampment.
The great campflre will. take place Fri
day night. August 21. It will call to the*

MRS. HANS BJERRE
1522 MadUon Ave., New York City,
Writes of the Virtues of
Cotlcnnu
"To-day I am thankful to say my
boys are hearty and strong as any chil-
dren in the city, bnt I had my fair shart
of care and work when they wer*
babies. An infant's skin is so delicate
- and fine that the least thing will hurt It.
For chafing, for all eruptions and out-
breaks on tho skin, for roughness and
chapping, I always used Cnticnra.
â¢â¢ If my boys all passed thro^h baby-
hood without any serious or'alarmlnj
skin trouble. I attribute that circum-
stance to the prompt and free use of
Cnticnra when the first sign of disease
appeared. I should add that we always
used Cnticnra Soap In bathing the chil-
dren. It Â¦eems to get all the impuri-
ties ont of the skin, and If there is a
single ingredient in it that can possibly
do harm, I have never found a trace of
it. 8ome times I read in papers of
babies who bare been allowed to suffer
a long time with a terrible disease be-
fore their mother* started to use Cutl-
cura. I think such cases as strange as
they are sad for by this time everybody
onght to know about Cuticura and
nobody ought to wait for weeks and
even months to pass before resorting to
this remedy.
"I wish every mother la the world Â»
could learn what a splendid thing Cuti-
cura is. Then we should have vastly
fewer sick, disfigured babies and vastly
fewer parents tortured with anxiety. 1 *
