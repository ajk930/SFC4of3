Shortly after 10 o'clock at

awoke wet with perspiration,
feeble in the extreme and his voice
hardly audible.
The fits of coughing had
brought pains in his chest and
shoulders, and, thinking, his end
was now near, he said to Dr. Lap
poni:
"Tell me when the time really
comes."
The doctor assured his Holiness
that he believed the danger of his
immediate passing was averted
for the night and for to-day.
These seemingly last moments
of Pope Leo are full of solemnity.
Perhaps his last hours would be
less melancholy and sad if the
august sufferer were less conscious
of the circumstances and his mind
less clear as to the duration of
time remaining to him before he
enters eternity. Although his
physical powers are at the lowest
ebb and his breathing becomes
more labored, 'the Pope's mind is
clear, as is manifest to all around
him by his bright, expressive
eyes and the few words he
now and then succeeds in
uttering. The scene is so
touching that those present can,
scarce restrain their tears. Count
Camillo Pecci, the Pope's nephew,
whom the dying man kept by his

'"Everything will depend upon the time

The Pope himself seemed persuaded
that this illness was his last and he ac
cordingly settled his affairs. Though
awaiting the end calmly, his mind was
clear and he still gave attention to mun
dane matters, despite the fact that he has
been wajned by his doctors, who feared
that his keen intellect might wear away
the frail sheath In which it was encased.
Toward evening the Pope grew worse
and the news spreading, together with
the tone of th<* last bulletin, caused con
siderable alarm. A correspondent saw
Mazzoni, who repeated in substance what
Dr. ,!Lapponi had said in the afternoon,
adding that to-night It was necesrary to
keep- up the Pontiff's strength through
artllicial respiration. Dr. Mazzoni at 10
o'clock expressed the opinion: that Pope
iljcb might live perhaps two days, with
out-excluding the hypothesis of a possi
ble ultimate recovery.*"
The Pope's illness Is a case in point.
During the whole of Friday and of Sat
urday, in spite of the blazing July sun
shine, cabs thronged the colonnades of
the Plaza of St. Peter's, the occupants
questioning the guards on duty at the
doors of the Vatican, watching the in
gress and egress of ecclesiastical and
other dignitaries and obtaining from them
if possible information regarding the
health of the illustrious patient.
Then came Sunday. The Pope seemed
to be sinking fast and hope died away
on the announcement that, the viaticum
would be. administered in the evening.
But as night wore on and the solemn rite
was accomplished, Â¦ and, contrary to ex
pectation, a slight improvement in the
Pontiff's condition was observed, the anx
iety diminished and tn<Â» crowds dwindled
away. Some persons believed" that the
amelioration was only temporary, the last
effort of failing vitality and that It would
be followed immediately by corresponding
prostration, but this surmise proved in
correct. All day yesterday the improve
ment was maintained.
**<k OME, July G.â Since the Pope's illâ
MJ ness assumed- its serious character
**^^,there has been no marked change in
the symptoms and the alternation from
hope to fear in the minds of the physi
cians has given place to a certain feeling
of apathy on the part of the populace.
For centuries the, Romans had been ac
customed to .the rise and fall of systems
of government and to changes of rulers.
This doubtless affected the present gener
ation, causing them to regard without
anxiety or. even keen .interest events of
this nature.

tion of the Pope's illness King Victor
Kramanucl will not be able to leave the
Kingdom until the successor to the pon
tifical throne has been elected and in
itialled.
One of the strangest features in his
condition fs the interest the Pope takes in
telegrams inquiring about his health. Yes
terday, having heard that a French lady
whom he had received in audience a few
weeks ago had telegraphed a message of
sympathy, he asked to see the message.
*ind when Monsignor Pifferl brought it
he was not allowed to look at the mes
paire, but wished to read it.
After the administration of the viaticum
telegrams hoping for his recovery were
shown to the Pope, and he appeared to be
much gratified.
Monsignor Piffcri, Pope Leo's confessor,
administered the extreme unction, and
v.-hen the ceremony was over his Holiness
sank back on the pillow with apparent
great relief that all was done and that
he was entering into rest after his long
pilgrimage.
tion seemed so hopeless that only
a short time apparently remained
before he would glide into his last
sleep. At Dr. Lapponi's initiative
a hasty consultation of the Pope's
relatives, Cardinal Rampolla and
other ecclesiastics was held and it
was decided that extreme unction
should be given. The Pontiff re
ceived the announcement with his
usual calmness, and, though
scarcely able to speak audibly, he
said he knew his time had come
and he was ready to appear be
fore the sublime tribunal with full
trust in the divine mercv.
speaking with Cardinal Oreglia yesterday,
his Holiness expressed the hope that the
conclave would not forget, the , wrong done
the Holy- â¢ See Â¦ in â¢ 1870 aria would elect a
man who would defend the rights of the
church, Its liberty and Independence. . He
also strongly recommended the Cardinal
to insure the seclusion of the conclave
from all outside influence.
"The disease, as' announced in the first
bulletin, is senile pneumonia in a torpid
form, which is now at its maximum In
tensity, but which may have begun un

any feeling of illness."
"Nothing medical science can suggest
and his organism can stand has been left
untriedâ for instance, oxygen, cutaneous

also have been Injected to produce more

"What surprises all who approach him
is that there has been no change in the
lucidity of his Intellect, which disease has
not affected. For instance, not a single
detail of the ceremony of the last com
munion escaped the Pope's observation.
He sooke of it with great interest, 1 re
calling each personage who participated.
"The worst symptom, apart from the
feebleness of the Pontiff's pulse, is his
low temperature, which Is stationary at
31 centigrade. He continues to take nour

doctors wish. -

plays great force of character.
"This morning, again, at his own wish,
he left his bed and seated- himself in his
arm chair, as he finds a sitting posture
more comfortable than being recumbent.

â¢ columns to the lively sympathy
which the Pope's illness has aroused in
Germany. Emperor Willam gave expres

graphed that H has been Impossible to

body ventured to prevent him getting up
Â¦when he demanded to do so with flash

The Pope, according to the Tageblatt,
FHid to Cardinal Agrlizrfle: "I will not die
in bed."
He went to his writing desk this morn
iv.z. selected with his own hand a memen
to for his favorite nenhew and then dic
tated to Cardinal Agliarde new additions
to a certain poem. Yesterday he dictated
to Monseicneur Angcll se\eral Latin
couplets on "Death."
Prayers Are Recommended
WASHINGTON, July â¬.-The apostolic
delegation at 8 o'clock to-night received
the following cablegram from Cardinal
Kampolla:
"Phenomenon of the illness of the h.oly
father more accentuated. Mind very
clear. Prayer? recommended."

The Pope, even' when in good health,
tlept only four or five hours each night
and often in the morning his bed was un
disturbed and the Pope was found asleep
in the very chair before Lis writing table.
The Pope has always decupled but a few
simple rooms, containing little beyond
necessaries. His bed stands in an alcove,
separated from a large room by a cur
tain hanging gracefully over marble col
umns. Above the bed is a picture of the
Madonna and child. Beside it Is a prayer
table surmounted by a crucifix. A ward
robe acalnst the wall' faces- the bed and
between the latter and the wall Is a
couch. The rest of the room is used as a
study and contains a writing table with
a crucifix, a chair on a carpeted platform,
chairs and tables for the Pope's secreta
ries, writing materials and a few bocks,
among which are the works of Dante,
Virgil and Horace, besides" a Bible. The
only window , of the . combined bedroom
and study overlooks the colonnade of tfie
plaza of St. Peter's. Adjoining, is a
small room furnished only with an arm
chair and lounge, where the Pope some
times took an afternoon nap. The rooms
are on the same level as the famous log
gia of Raphael.
The Pope objected to having the'cxy
gen-lnhaling apparatus continuously un
der his nostrils and Dr.". Lapponi arranged
to Impregnate' the whole atmosphere . of
the room with oxygen.: :
"That Is much better." said the Pontiff.
"Before I felt as though I had lost my
liberty."
The dying Pope gave striking proof of
his well-known taste for the classics. He
had partly composed and partly corrected
a new Latin poem. This he intrusted to
Monseigneur Angeli. one of his private
secretaries, directing him to have It print
ed for publication, and adding:
"I shall die happier in thinking that
something will remain of me that I have
done at the very last moment."
When the Pope was informed of Em
peror Francis Joseph's dispatch, commu
nicated to the Vatican by the Austrian
Embassy, ho said:
"The Emperor and I are the only sur
vivors of a past generation."
On hearing of the Austrian Embassador
at the Vatican. Count de Temerin, being
ill, the Pope expressed his sorrow at his
illness. :Â¦'.-. t ., .:
The Pontiff made further inquiries as to
what communications had been received
at the Vatican from foreign rulers and
was extremely pleased to learn that MJ
Lazzard. the French Embassador to the
Vatican, had. in spite of the strained re
lations between the French republic and
the Holy See. called daily during the Pon
tiff's illness and had expressed to Cardi
nal Rampolla the concern of the French
Government as well as that of President
Loubet.
More than 500 telegrams expressing sym
pathy with the Pope and asking for news
of his condition arrived at the Vatican to
day. Including messages from President
Roosevelt. King Edward and Emperor
Francis Joseph. Dowager Queen Mar
gherita is reported to have asked about
news of the Pontiff. The most important
telegrams of Inquiry are communicated to
the Pope.
After receiving the sacrament yester
day the Pope said:
"I am now near my end. I do not know
if all I have done is good, but I certainly
obeyed my conscience and our faith."
The Pontiff yesterday ordered that a
piano be given to his grand nephews, also
giving directions that they should be told
that the Pope thtfught of them in his last
moment.
All those who saw the Pope
were struck by his energy. He was re
ported as still addressing those about him.
"No doubt," the Pontiff is reported to
have said, "I am near my end, but I want
to die in harness."
â¢^OME, . July 6.â The newspapers
m_M ner e contained many conflicting
JF^r statements about the Pope and
Â«Â¦> his condition during the day.
"Now. "I am read y - to depart, having
settled all my affairs. I feel I have done
all In my power for tha' good of the
church and of humanity."
TluÂ» Pope durfrig the day also received
Count Rlccardo Xpecci, another nephew,
and spoke to him with great serenity of
the probability that he would not long
be with him. and then the Pontiff re
ceived his secretaries, Monselgneurs An
geli and Marcllonl, conversing with them
regarding personal affairs, instructing
them about his writings and* giving direc
tions as to the disposal of his books.
Although Dr. Lapponi continuously rec
ommended that the patient cease to speak
and pay no attention to what was goi
ing on. the Pope said, smilingly; to Dr.
Lapponi:
"I know you say this because of your
affection for me, but either, my last day
is rapidly approaching, in which I must
employ all the time that is left to m^ so
far as I can, or else I shall recover, again
postponing the end. If this is the will of
the Almighty, nothing can change it."
The Pope wished his arm chair to be
carried near his writing table and then to
the window overlooking the piazza of St.
Peter. Noticing many people in carriages
the Pope said: ~~ -
"The piazza looks as it Â«.loes when I am
able to perform some public function."
The only persons allowed In the Pope's
bedroom this morning, besides the doc
tors and attendants, were Cardinal Ram
polla. Mgr. Bislettl, the master of the
pontifical chambers, and Brigadier Gen
eral Count- Camilla Pecci or the Noble
Guard, a nephew of the Pope. The Pope
conversed for a long time with Count

room for a few minutes, leaning on His
arm. The Pontiff on this occasion ' re

German Kaiser
Sends Message
of Sympathy
â¬ince the earliest days of Victoria's
reign Leo has dominated the Imagination
and held the affectionate esteem of the
British nation. Queen Victoria ranked
the Pope among the greatest leaders of
mankind. On the occasion of the Jubilee
of his priesthood in 18S7 Victoria sent a
special envoy with valuable gifts and an
address of congratulation to his Holiness,
who acknowledged the honor with touch
ing eloquence and cordiality and availed
himself of every opportunity to foster the
good relations thus attested.
King Edward's recent visit to the Pope
strengthened the Anglo- Vatican entente
and did much to allay the irritation
which had begun to appear in the form of
a protestation of the Catholic church in
England on account of the sovereign's
anti-Catholic coronation declaration. The
King's courtesy was construed as show
ing the pure formality of the insult and
the capability of the English, in their
regard for greatness, to rise above the
mechanism of English law.
. It is recalled that many years ago Leo,
as unknown Joachim Peeci, visited the
London slums and won the hearts of the
common people. His observations of that
time have been woven Into the fabric cf

â Â¦ i rur. July 6.â There is great ac-
j tivity among the Cardinals now
gi^ that It is certain that a conclave
A cannot be far off. It Is even said
that there has been an exchange
of telegrams in cipher between the mem
bers of the Sacred College in Rome and
those in the provinces or abroad. Innu
merable rumors are circulating, and
scarcely any Cardinal is deprived of the
flattery of being considered a candidate.
However, besides those mentioned la
these dispatches yesterday the only can
didates who are regarded as having a fair
chance are Cardinals Svampa, Archbishop
of Bologna, and Cardinal Richelmy, Arch
bishop of Turin.
Cardinal Rampolla ia believed by many
to have the best chance of being elected.
According to the most accredited Vatican
gossip, however, Cardinal Rampolla has
entered into an agreement with Cardinal
Gottl, prefect of the congregation of thÂ»
propaganda, to support the election of the
latter on condition that he himself be ap

Catholics will bring powerful Influence to

days ago certain jealous French authori
ties published a polemic against "German
conquest of the Vatican," describing how
the religious orders in Rome, the pon
tifical court and all consultative depart
ments of the Vatican had undergone Ger
manization.
Vannutelli and Gottl. two Cardinals re
garded as most likely candidates for the
succession, both rank in Berlin as friend
ly to Germany. Gotti has received sev
eral decorations from the Kaiser.
The Ideal Pope from the German stand
point would be Cardinal Agiiardi, former
ly papal nuncio at Munich, who is known
as an ardent pro-German.
What is most gratifying to Germany is
the fact that the election of Cardinal
Bampolla seems excluded. Almost any
Pope not allied to Rampolla's "French-
Spanish-Italian clique" would be satisfac
tory to the Catholics of the Fatherland.
Bampolla Still Hopeful.
MUNICH. Bavaria. July 6.â Cardinal
Rampolla, the Papal Secretary of State,
has telegraphed to the Papal Nuncio here
that the condition of the Pope Is grave,
but not hopeless.

splendid racing .conditions. The course
was east by north.

TONOPAII, Nev., July 6.â The continued
Fourth of July celebration hero which
began so auspiciously had a sad ending,
for it wound up" in a shooting.
Dunn was 23 years of age and a popular
man." His relatives live in Virginia City.
i Just before the firemen's race occurred
last evening a blacksmith known' as
Frank Smith assaulted Walter ; Dunn on
Main street with a knife. Before outsiders
could interfere he cut Dunn flvo'~br si*
times. One of the thrusts penetrated the
lower part of the body, causing Dunn's
death this morning.
Smith was arrested and- during the
night was surreptitiously taken out of
town by officers that he might escape the
wrath of Dunn's friends. Considerable
excitement prevails and it will go hard
with Smith if he is located.

The New Albany company, was called out
and placed under arms, . ready to move
on a moment's notice, arrangements hav

The Governor was indignant that the

. TERROR OF PRISONERS. V
Many of the wounded were taken away
before their names could be learned. The
Police Department and ambulance corps
were anxious that too much be not
learned by the reporters and it was with
the greatest difficulty that facts could be
ascertained. , Â¦ â¢
Inside the jail forty-three prisoners lay
terrified in the darkness. ; .nteen of them
were negroes, whose . lives are far . from
safe if the mob attacks the jail again and
effects a capture. - Lights were turned out
when the shooting began and the.prlson
ers'moaned and cried in their cells. Tele
phone messages were sent from the jail
to the hospitals and to physicians, calling
for aid. The response "was quick, doctors
from . all "sections of Evansvllls driving
rapidly at the call.
The Vincennes company of militia is on
On Division street, lying between her
grief-stricken father and mother, the lit
tle Alaman girl was dead, with her breast
torn away by a buckshot charge. She
was out driving with her parents, who,
attracted by the noise, stopped a few
minutes to watch the excitement.
In the yard of the Courthouse wounded
rioters lay and back of thÂ«; lino of soldiers
two of the militiamen had fallen.
On the jail steps stood Sheriff Kratz.
At his side was Colonel McCoy of the
First Regiment. Around them stood a
few doctors and reporters.
When the firing had ceased Captain
Blum reformed his men and gave these
orders:
Keep that mob back. Call on them to halt.
If they do not halt, shoot them down. We
can't take anj' more chances. Men, be care
ful, but for God's sake keep a close watch.
The men prepared for another struggle.
It did not come. The rioters scattered
quickly, fearing that another charge
would be made. They stood in knots
around the corners in the vicinity utter
ing dire threats against the officers and
the militia-. "Let's go get the dân mur
derers!" called one. "Down with them'.'*
"Kill them!" and a score" of cries were
heard. Some of the rioters tried to
change their positions and .'were greeted
with cries of "Halt!" accompanied by the
clicking of rifle hammers.
Within half an hour things had become
so nulet that care could be taken of the
dead and wounded. The wounded sol
diers were taken into the Jail. Their in
juries were slight and were dressed 1 by
two surgeons who were there. Four
wounded militiamen were taken to the
courthouse ands later to their homes.
The . others were taken to . hos
pitals and their homes in ambulances and
carriages. This feat was accomplished
with difficulty, as only a few men were
brave enough to pick them up.
Charles "Presky, a 17-year-old boy, was
carried into the courthouse. Through his
wrist had gone a buckshot and each foot
was shot through.
Governor Durbin is said to have in
structed the authorities not to jeopardize
the safety of the jail with half-way
measures. The soldiers and deputies fired
Into the retreating mob of men who ran
Into Division street. For fifteen minutes
the firing continued. When it ceased the
soldiers had the place.
In front of the staggering band of fif
ty-eight soldiers lay the dead and wound
ed. Moans and shrieks of agony and fear
came from the wounded. Ed Schiffrnan,
a painter, who was seen in the. front
ranks of the mob' during the evening, lay
on the sidewalk, the top of his ' head
blown off. A short distance from him lay
another man and close by him another
young man lay dead, with a bullet wound
over the heart. All along the street,
crawling and moaning, wounded rioters
and onlookers tried to ease their pain and
escape by getting away from the jail.
CHILD SHOT DOWN.
The one shot started a fusillade of
musketry and shotgun fire from the de
fenders of the jail and a scattered return
fire from "the rioter?. Fully 300 shots were
fired from the Jail windows, the court-
Hiouse steps Immediately opposite and the
soldiers in the streets. No one knows who
fired the first shot. The soldiers say It
was the rioters.
Suddenly a rioter fell. A soldier tried
to drag him to his feet, but before he
could do so was assaulted by a rioter.
Stones and bowlders began to hurtle
through the air. A soldier was struck by
a rock and fell. A rioter was knocked
down with a gun butt and then a shot
was fired.
Captain Blum of the National Guard
ordered a charge o:i the rioters. Gradu
ally the crowd was forced back, the sol
diers using their bayonets and the butts
of their guns.

onlookers and the curious followed. Slow
ly they forced the militiamen back toward
the jail until the alley way between Divi

reached. Then the leaders, with a bicycle
in their front as a shield to the bayonets
of the soldiers, attempted to enter the
alley and storm the alleyway entrance.

The first clash between the militia and
citizens occurred this afternoon, a few
hours after tho soldiers took up their sta

He was halted and turned back, but ad

assailant with his bayonet. The man was
not badly injured.
Late this evening a man was found try

was caught and an effort was made by
the soldier to force^hixnT outside the lines.

There is no foretelling the possibilities of the auto

Regarding the naval maneuvers at Kiel the
Kreuz Zeitung says of the American sailors: "They
are careless in appearance and are not careful in giv r

behavior had an even worse effect on some of Spain's
sailors quite recently.
A CURIOUS report comes from Washington to
the effect that Mr. Cannon, who is sure to be
elected Speaker of the House, has decided to
oppose any attempt during the coming session of
Congress to provide for currency legislation. He
is said to have declared a conviction that the coun
try does not need either a "rubber" currency or an
asset currency, that the demand for such legislation
comes from Wall street only, and will be opposed by
the House.
In explaining the attitude of the coming Speaker
the Washington correspondent of the New York
Tribune says: "The positive attitude of Mr. Can
non on this subject is regarded by legislators who
have been in close touch with the situation as an
indication of the beginning of a vigorous indepen
dent policy on the part of the House of Representa
tives. There is said to be no question of Mr. Can
non's election as Speaker of the Fifty-eighth Con
gress. His inclination for a test of strength with the
.Senate was clearly shown, it is pointed out, by re
marks which he made in the closing hours of the
last session, when he characterized the methods , of
'another body' as being practically those of 'stand
and deliver.' "
Should this report prove true, and Mr. Cannon r as
Speaker of the House, undertake to force* an issue
with the Senate on the currency question, he will
make a serious blunder. Popular sympathy was with
him when he made his famous declarations con
cerning the duty. of the House to resist the aggres
sions of the Senate, and if ' he were to choose a
favorable ground en which to make a, battle for the
rights of the House popular sympathy would re
main with him and be a potent ally in his fight; but
public opinion will be against him if he undertakes to
baffle any welldirected effort at currency legislation
during the coming winter.
It is no doubt very clever to speak of an elastic
currency as a "rubber" currency, but the issue is too

The British War Office has decided to furnish
gratis fajie teeth to any soldier who has lost his

LAWYEBS ABE ACCUSED
OF WBONGING A CLIENT
Attorney General of Hawaii Prefers
Grave Charges Against Two Prac
titioners at Honolulu.
HONOLULU. June 27.â In the Supreme
Court yesterday Attorney General An
drews preferred charges of unprofessional
conduct against , Attorneys A. S. Hum
phreys and Frank E. Thompson. The
charges arose through their action in the
case of John K. Sumner, who sold prop
erty to the Oahu Railroad and Land
Company for $110,000. which amount was
tied up in litfgation until yesterday, when
Sumner secured J-JS.023, all that was left
of his money. Humphreys and Thompson
acted as attorneys for Sumner. arranging
a settlement with his relatives, who had
tied up the old man's estate, but failing:.
It is alleged, to procure a release from
them. Subsequently, it Is alleged. "the at
torneys acted for the^ heirs and relatives,
causing their former client's money to
again be tied up, thus acting without pro
fessional propriety. It is further alleged
that they threatened by legal process to
prevent Sumner controlling the money.
WISCONSIN has a member of the State
Board of Control named Kuestermann,
who has ideas about immigration that are
no doubt derived from his own nativity. He objects
to excluding indigents and illiterates, declaring that
"so long as factories and other enterprises find diffi
culty in getting men illiteracy ought not to be made
a test, while a property test will shut out gooc? and
patriotic citizens."
To this it may be retorted that so long as the re
form schools and juvenile penal institutions of this
country contain tens of thousands of native American
youths, who fester in the vices of idleness because
illiterate and indigent immigration * outlaws them
from trades and excludes them from occupation, all
immigration might be stopped with benefit to the
country until its occupations absorb all of its own
native increase in population.
Mr. Kuestermann is in favor of admitting indi
gents because he says that many years, ago Francis
A. Hoffman landed in this country with only $6 in
his pocket and later on became Lieutenant Governor
of Illinois. But Mr. Hoffman was an exception
among the immigrants of his day. The most of
them brought property along and nearly all of them
were more desirable than those that come now from
Southeastern Europe.
Foreign immigration for the fiscal year ending
June 30 amounted to but little short of a million, or
one alien and a fraction to each 100 of our popula
tion. The country does hot need it and cannot use
such an influx profitably to itself or to the immi
grants. The signs of .a surplus population of that
kind are increasing. One infallible sign that a coun
try is suffering from such a cause is when the alien
element is strong enough to deny to any part of the
native population its natural rights. This is being
done, with the result of penalizing native Americans
by enforced idleness.

ItT is a pitiful tale that comes from the northern
I seas of a stranded ship, a volunteer to watch her
A while her skipper and crew went away to return
and rescue him and the property of others that he
stayed to save. A week went by, in the solitary vigil,
a month, two months, and finally a third of a year.
The ship stranded because some miscreant, as
scoundrelly as the solitary guard was true and brave,
had concealed a piece of iron in the compass, so that
the magnetic needle no longer told the truth. She
sailed out of her course and struck on the rocks of
an island, barren in the Arctic winter. Keel and rock
met on the last day of September, 1902. The captain
â¢ and crew landed, and three days later were taken off
by a passing vessel and sent to Seattle â all but one.
Th* property of the owners was at stake, and Wil
liam Ode, sailorman, volunteered to guard it until
rescue came. More than four months later the relief
'sailed from Seattle and found the stranded ship, and
<Iead within her ribs William Ode, sailorman, his
bones bleaching and keeping grim guard over his
self-appointed tru?t. Beside them lay the ship's log,
in which, from October 4, 1902, to February, 1903, he
made a daily record of his lonely watch in the
ivhite silence.
Daily he worked at the ship's pump to keep out
the destroying water. Fuel and food grew shorter
and shorter. Scurvy, the scourge of the sea, gnawed
his flesh. For fresh water he depended on the snow,
and as it melted from the ship that supply grew less
and less. His daily log has been published. It is an
uncomplaining record of his pain, starvation, thirst
and bitter agony, and, most wonderful of all, this
remarkable man made no record of blame of the
skipper and the owners who had heartlessly deserted
and left him to die, while they went about their busi
ness in safety and when it suited them, a quarter
of a year later, set out to rescue his bones and their
His daily log is at first a businesslike record of
each day's doings, the weather and condition of the
ship. When his provisions began to run short it is
mentioned as if the need were another's and not his.
The weather is pitiless, great gales blow, the sun
goes below the horizon and the Arctic night falls on
sea and shore, and he tells it as if the effect of tem
pest, frost and the great darkness had been upon a
mate whose story he told from dictation. When,
finally, disease and ftarvation had wrought upon
his strength until he could no longer make a fire
to cook the miserable dole of improper food that was
left, hopeless of relief, but making no record of his
disappointment, not accusing the shameless wretch
who had disordered the compass nor the inhuman
â¢ owners and captain who had left him to perish, he
bravely faced death.
On December 1 he had written in the log: "My
twentv-seventh birthday; carried fifteen barrels of
water." February 17 he wrote: "I can get aft no
more. No fire in the stove for three days. I hope
it will end soon." And February 19: "Life is sweet,
but death is sweeter in a case like this. To-day I had
only some dried ?pples and a piece of ice." The 20th
he wrote, "I am waiting for my death," and then,
probably the next day: "Death at last. Four months
alone." The tragedy was over. He was a young
man, and to the young life is dear, but, no sail in
sight, he turned like a philosopher to the only ship
Â¦â¢"that could take him off, and when death steered that
way the forlorn man hailed it as months before he
would have greeted the coming of rescue.
Pity and admiration for this forlorn martyr strug
gle "with each other for expression. In the presence
of his bones who shall say that duty, responsibility
and self-sacrifice are no longer among the master
motives of men? It is one thing to die in high ac
tion, to be suddenly swept over the line that bounds
the hereafter, while the world looks on and history
, * ftands with pen poised to make, enduring record.
But it is quite another thing to die as did William
Ode. with the wrath of the -northern gale for his
requiem, the sunless winter- and a cheerless sea
around him. Those who were responsible will be

As the beast kicked in Its death strug
gles and was nearing the edge of the
precipice, Ogburn yelled to Watts to
clutch a young tree growing within reach.
The advice was heeded. A second after
ward the bear toppled over the edge.
REDDING, July 6.â On the edge of a
cliff. 100 feet above a canyon, John
Watts, a cattle raiser of this county, lay
on his back and hung on to the jowls of
a bear which had fallen on top of him
until the animal was shot by Watts'
companion. Then the beast, in Its death
struggles, rolled down the precipice and
nearly took the man along with it.
That is the story that Watts and his
companion, John Ogburn. tell of an oc
currence in the Big Bend region of this
county. The bear ran up a ridge near
the camp, with the dogs and men after It.
Near a precipice it took refuge in a thick
clump of young firs. Ogburn started
around on one side of the firs. Watts re
maining near the precipice.
The bear saw Osburn, but did not see
Watts. Out it ran. plump against Watts,
knocking him down and falling on top of
him. Watts, for some reason, took a firm
grasp on each Jowl of the bear. Before
the bear recovered it3 senses sufficiently
to hurt the man beneath it. Ogburn came
running with his rifle, pressed it against
the bear's side and sent a bullet' Into Its
heart.
WHEN public attention was directed a few
years ago to the employment of child labor
.on an extensive scale in the cotton mills of
the South there was a sanguine belief that the evil
would soon be abated under the pressure of public
opinion. That belief has been dissipated. Recent
disclosures have brought to light the fact that child
labor is employed in some of the Northern States
in defiance of law almost as extensively as in the
South itself, and it has been furthermore made known
that it is going to be no easy matter to get good
laws enacted in the South or to get them enforced
in the North.
The Philadelphia Public Ledger quotes the chief
of the State Department of Mines as saying that the
bituminous miners in the western part of Pennsyl
vania have determined to defy the law and then
goes on to say: "The people of the State will gen
erally be very. much surprised to hear this, after all
the fierce diatribes hurled at the 'conscienceless
operators' who were supposed to have heartlessly en
couraged, or at least permitted, the employment of
those of tender years in the hard andidangerous work
of the mines; but wonder will grow wheri it is an
nounced that not only the bituminous miners, but a
large part, if not the great majority, of the very an
thracite miners who aroused the sympathies of the
country so effectively in their behalf by reciting the
horrors of child labor in the mines. and the callous
cruelty of the operators, are also arrayed against the
enforcement of the law."
A similar frankness has been displayed by the cot
ton manufacturers of Georgia. The Legislature of
that State is now in session and has a child labor
bill under consideration. A representative of the
Georgia Industrial Association recently appeared be
fore the Assembly and made a straight-out plea for
child labor. He declared that advocates of the pro
posed legislation were either sentimentalists, antago
nists of Southern mills or demagogues seeking no
toriety. His speech contained no promise of any
mitigation of the existing evil, nor any admission that
it'is an evil. From start to finish it was a declaration
of intention to run the mills by child labor as far as
possible.
Declarations of that kind serve to show the need
of a new campaign of education on the child labor
question. It will never do for this country to take
a back step on that issue. It may be difficult to pro
cure the enactment of good laws in the South, but
they will come in time 'if the progressive elements of
the Southern people are properly aided and encour
aged in their struggle to obtain them. As for the
Northern States, the laws can be enforced if the
officials do their duty and are "-properly sustained
by a resolute public opinion. â¢

WITH A BEAR
AT A PRECIPICE
"This Is the annual overflow of the Colo
rado River," said Mr. Lippincott. "but
th* volume of water is many times that
generally passing through the channel at
flood tide, 'me Colorado RK'er, like the
Nile, has a season of summer overflow
which is caused by melting snows and
heavy rains In the mountains of Montana.
Wyoming and Colorado. This flood water
has washed its way through the Grand
Canyon, traveling in all more than 2000
miles. At the present the river is
discharging "3,000 cubic 'feet of water per
second and there have been practically no
additions to the flood during the last fif
teen hundred miles which the water has
traveled. The farmers below Yuma had
been warned by Government reports that
the flood was coming and they drove most
of their live stock to the high ground be
fore it reached them. The loss of prop
erty and of crowing crops is very heavy.
The river down below Yuma will average
almost ten miles In width."
LIppincott was caught in a portion of
the flood caused by the breaking of one
of the levees along the river at Yuma
and was rescued by an improvised life
saving crew patrolling the flooded district
in boats. He says the flood Is the worst
that has been experienced since the Gov
ernment land below Yuma was opened to
settlement.
LOS ANGELES, July 6.â J. B. Llppin
cott, consulting engineer of the United
States Geological Survey, has returned
from the Colorado River country about
Yuma and tells of the unprecedented flood
of waters now rushing down that stream.
Melting snows and cloudbursts in the up
per reaches of the Colorado have swollen
It far beyond the record of summer rises.
The river has broken over dikes and
levees at many places between ..Needles
and Yuma. and thousands of acres of
ranch lands are under water. Forty thou-
Band acres of bottom lands below Yuma
are flooded to the depth of from five to
fifteen feet. A canal which furnished Ir
rigating facilities for ranchers between
Yuma and the mouth of the river has
been washed out. Water from the river
is rushing down the canal and inundating
thousands of acres of rich farm lands.
On Thursday the American officers will
be entertained at breakfast bv the Pil
grims' Club and afterward Admiral Cot
ton, the captains of the American vessels
and Attache Stockton will dine with the
Kin? at Buckingham Palace.
On Friday the Lord Mayor will give tha
American officers a luncheon at the Man
sion House, and In the evening they will
attend a dinner given by Embassador
Choate at the American embassy, to
which King Edward has been invited,
but it is feared that his Majesty will be
unable to attend. The entertainment will
end July 13 with a ball given at Ports
mouth. Rear Admiral Cotton will return
some of the courtisies extended to the
American squadron by giving a reception
and dinner on the Kearsarge on July 14.
On Wednesday, besides the entertain
ments at Portsmouth. Admiral Cotton,
his captains and Naval Attache Stockton
will be the guests of honor at a dinner
at the London house of the Earl of Sel
borne, First Lord of the Admiralty. Later,
accompanied by twenty-three other ofil
cers of the sauadron, they will attend
the state ball given in honor of President
Loubet at Buckingham Palace.
PORTSMOUTH, EnÂ«r-. July *â¢â In the
{nidst of the entertainment of President
Loubet England has not neglected to
make full preparations for the reception
of Rear Admiral Cotton's squadron. The
American warships were not expected to
arrive until to-morrow morning, but the
heavy weather in the channel diove the
Kearsargc. San Francisco and Chicago
into Spithead to-night. As soon as the
news was communicated to Admiral Ho
tham the vessels of the channel squadron
began to twinkle ft welcome with their
electric lights, but beyond this there was
no demonstration. The gunboat Machlas
has not yet arrived, but Is expected to
join Admiral Cotton before morning. The
British squadron at Portsmouth is more
formidable In offensive power than the
channel squadron, which received Pres
ident Loubet at Dover to-dav. .
The city Is decorated with the British
and American colors. The American war
ships assembled at Spithead will enter
Portsmouth harbor at 9:30 to-morrow
morning, passing through the line of the
British warships, which will lire salutes.
This compliment will be returned by the
Kearsarge and her consorts. Official
calls will then be exchanged by Lord
Charles Beresford. Admiral Milne and
Rear Admiral Cotton. Admiral Hotham
will be the host to-morrow night giving
a dinner at the Admiralty House, which
will be attended by Admiral Cotton, Flag
Lieutenant Hussey, Flag Secretary
Manna and the captains of the American
warships. After the dinner both fleets
will be illuminated.
.When men can go no further than that in denoun
cing an outbreak of lawlessness amounting to an
archy in its worst form, it is evident there is some
thing radically wrong with the tone of public sen
timent. The issue is the more fearful because it has
come upon the country in a most unexpected and
unintelligible way. It is but a few years ago that
the first case of burning a negro at a stake occurred,
and at that time it was received with expressions of
horror all over the Union. Since that time the of
fense has been so frequent that it has become almost
a commonplace. The terrible spirit that prompts it
appears to be increasing in force and spreading in
extent, so that it has now become an issue of most
serious importance to the country.
When first public attention was drawn to the fre
quency of lynching the defense was that the crime
was committed only as a punishment for assaults
upon women. That defense is no longer valid.
Some of the most fearful lynchings have occurred
where no such crime was committed or even alleged.
It has been suggested that a better system of pub
lic education in the South would put an end to the
evil, but in Northern States, where a hjgh standard
cf public education prevails, there haVe been just
as bad lynchings as in any Southern State. It seems
that the cause of the crime is nothing more nor less
than the breaking down of law. The people nave
no respect for their courts nor for their law officers.
In its last dialysis lynching is nothipg more than
anarchy, and sooner or later it will have to be dealt
with as anarchy and sternly suppressed by the strong
hand of established order. â¢
The introduction of the resolution precipitated a
stormy discussion, and in the end the union adopted
a compromise declaration, contenting itself with say
ing: "We earnestly express our great sorrow and
grief over the awful tragedies recently enacted in a
neighboring State, and we pray for the early restora
tion of peace and right and law throughout all our
native land."-
s-*^ LOSELY following the burning of the negro,
I White, near Wilmington, Uel., and the con
s'-^ sequent danger of a race war between^ the
whites and the blacks of that city, come reports of a
similar outburst of lawlessness at Evansville, Ind.
Those two instances do not stand alone. Statisti
cians who keep a record of lynchings report that up
to the time of the Wilmington outrage there had
been since January I no less than forty-five such
cases. They have occurred in the North and the
West as well as in the South, and there is every
reason to believe they are liable to occur wherever
an opportunity for them is afforded..
The extent of the evil has now become as notable
as its lawlessness. It is evident that from one cause
or another a considerable percentage of the Ameri
can people are becoming subject to fits of violent
rage that render them incapable of reasoning or of
acting like responsible persons. A mad desire for
vengeance against some suspected criminal breaks
out in a seemingly well ordered community, and at
once hundreds of men and not a few women begin
clamoring for a victim. No influence of good men,
no authority of law, is sufficient to check their mad
impulse, and soon another crime is added to the list
that is already appalling.
The lynching spirit seems, in fact, to be rapidly
spreading over the country. It shows itself every
where, even in places where it is least to be expected
or condoned. An illustration of the extent to which
it has infused the minds of educated men is furnished
by a recent occurrence in Philadelphia. The crime
that led up to the Wilmington lynching was com
mitted so near Philadelphia that the Ministerial
Union of that city deemed it expedient to make a
declaration concerning it. A resolution was intro
duced beginning with the statement: "In view of the
atrocious acts of lawlessness within a few miles of
Philadelphia, by which American manhood has been
stained, the efficiency of popular institutions brought
into question and Christianity horrified at the sight
of a multitude of people wearing its garb gloating
over the writhing form of a human being slowly
burned to death in their applauding presence," and
going on to say: "The Ministers' Union of Phila
delphia and vicinity hereby proclaims its abhorrence
of such acts of lawlessness and calls upon all who
love God and their country to use every means in
their power to suppress mob rule and aid those
in authority to 'apprehend and punish any who may
set the law at defiance." '

Carmen's Union and the United

thetic scene. C. F. Otterson, a car re
pairer, waa on the witness stand and was
testifying how small his pay was and how
hard he had to work. Question by ques
tion he was plied by Attorney Moore and
each time he answered in a straightfor
ward manner. At last the heartstrings of
the man were touched by the direct ques
tion of "why he, was' unable to save any
money from his salary of $75 a month."
For a moment the man was sllent;^then
his lips moved and he tried to force out
an explanation, but his efforts were fruit
less. With choking sobs he rose from his
chair and left tho room. A fellow carman
then whispered the explanation that Ot
terson's earnings had been eaten up by
doctors' bills. He was the father of three
children, and one of them, a little girl,
while playing in front of the house, had
been run over by a car and one of her

The first witness called yesterday
morning by E. J. Livernash was James
Brown of San Mateo, who examines the
applicants for the positions of carmen on
the road. He said there were two hiring
days a week and that the number of men
examined on each of these days averaged
about forty. ' Usually there were only
about six vacancies, but all the men who
called were seen and questioned. He told
in detail how he examined the men. The
company rarely engaged any who had not
references or letters to show where they
were last employed. He divided the ap
plicants into three classes, the first being
those who had trades and were unable to
Becure steady employment at them; sec
ondly, those who wanted to work on street
cars on account of the healthful employ
ment; and lastly, those who had saved
their money, had gone into business,
failed In their venture and wanted to
work for wages again. The applicants be
longed to a diversity of trades, with a few
professional men. One man had replied,
when he had asked him how much a day
was the most he had ever earned, "One
thousand dollars; I was formerly a mem
ber of the New York Produce Exchange."

legs had been amputated. "Otterson is
kind of sensitive about it," the carman
whispered, and when the witness had
dried his tears and bravely returned to
the witness stand. Attorney Moore in a
quiet and courteous manner excused him
self for asking such a direct question,
saying he did not know of Otterson's af
fliction.

promote i to his present position from a
gripman. He owned his own home, which
his wife paid for with money that she
saved running a restaurant years ago
when they were first married. He com
plained that he was sick quite often and
lost much money by not being able to re
port. He refused to state how much
money he had in the bank.
Andrew a Forsberg, a car repairer,
earned $2 60 a day, he said. Ha is mar
ried, but has no children. He also refused
to tell how much his bank account
amounted to.
The taking of testimony will be re
sumed this forenoon at 10 o'clock.
During the afternoon session W. J. Mc-
Cloud, a track rvpairer in the employ of
the United Railroads, was recalled .by
Livernash. He complained that the cor
poration classed him as n laborer and
only paid him $2 a day. McCloud thought
his work was worth more money, as Ke
had to use all kinds of tools, and attcr
many years' experience was skilled at his
calling. Attorney Moore took him in
hand and attempted to -lraw a compari
son between his work and that of a sec
tion hand.
C. F. Otterson testified that he was a
car repairer at the Sacramento- street car
house. Ht> worked ten hours a day and
through working in excess of these hours
got his Sundays off. He said that word
ing these extra hours was very distaste
ful to him and he would prefer to wo;k
just the regular ten hours a day and get
two Sundays off a month if he could ar
range it. He thought a car repalror
should receive {3 a day and that the
hours of labor should be cut down to nine
hours. â¢
Thomas Kane, a switchman with a
melancholy countenance and who i3 a fa
miliar figure at the Junction of Halght
and Market streets, was next called. He
had more grievances than a policeman.
He told how he had to watch the cars
and keep a mental record of their time
schedule, raise and lower cables, stand
out in the street in all sorts of weather,
and last, but not least, dodge every rub
ber-tired buggy, the occupants of which
rarely cared whether the switchman was
run over.
His wages were $2 75 a day and he was

SAN RAFAEL., July 6.â An autopsy
on the body of Colonel W. J. Best
of New York City, who died in
San Rafael April 6, will determine
whether Dr. John Donald Woods
and his sister, Alice Cloy Wood, will be
brought from the East to Marin County
for trial upon a charge of murder.
Colonel Best died at the home of these
pecple, and his son, Charles Sumner Best,
alleges that his death t>ccurred under sus
picious circumstances. He also makes af
fidavit charging- J. D. Woods and Alice
Cloy Wood with robbery, obtaining money
under false pretenses and forgery. The son
lias asked the District Attorney here to
have warrants Issued upon these charges.
His affidavit contains sensational allega
tions against the people in question. These
are set forth substantially in the follow
ing letter to the District Attorney, which
accompanied the affidavit:
NEW YORK. June 27. 190.1.
To the Honorable the 1'rcsc-cuting Attor

DOG REVEALS PRESENCE
OF BODY OF AN INFANT
Charles Schwally Discovers Dead
Child Through the Peculiar
Actions of a Canine.
A bulldog was the medium of bringing
to light a most peculiar case last night
that may prove to be one of murder.
Charles Schwally, a bartender employed
in a saloon at 1<*53 Market street, while
walking through the yard in the rear of
the establishment, noticed a pet canine
suspiciously sniffing and tearing at what
appeared to be a bundle of newspapers.
Driving the dog away he investigated and
upon unwrapping the bundle found the
body of a recently born child. He imme
diately communicated the UiFCov^ry to
the Coroner's office and Depart
ment.
Deputy Coroner diaries Meehan and
Detective Harry Reynolds repaired to the
scene and upon investigation leatned
from George Wagner, residing at 10G5
Market street, that he haa seen a Â¦woman
go upon the roof of a house adjoining the
ealoon property last evening. He was
positive that the woman went through
one of the windows of Mri. Dean's Turk
ish bath parlors. Owing to the darkness
he was unable to state whether she had
thrown a bupdle Into the yard below and
could give no description of her. Â¦
Mrs. Louise Dean, who was slightly In
disposed, was found in her rooms in com
pany with a man. She denied knowing
anything about the. case, but upon being
interrogated at length by Detective Rey
nolds admitted that two women had
called upon her last evening. She was
unable to remember their names, but was
certain one was a married woman resid
ing on Geary street. To all other ques
tions her memory was a blank except
that the told one of the women to open
the window in question, but did not pee
her go out on the roof. \
The police are confident that she knows
the identity of the two women who called
upon her and she was taken into custody
and her name entered on the detinue
book. . 1
The body was found wrapped in a copy
of a newspaper. The skull appears to be
fractured, but beyond that the body is in
a fair state of preservation and at the
time of death the child was not ovsr 48
hours old. The police are actively work
ing on the case and expect to apprehend
the guilty persons.

CHARGES FATHER WITH
J NEGLECT OF DAUGHTER
Warrant Out for the Arrest of George
Hubbard, Concert Hall
Manager.
' A warrant was secured from Police
Judge Fritz yesterday for the arrest" of
George Hubbard, also known as George
Howard, manager of Kapp & Street's con
cert hall, on a charge of failure to pro-,
vide for his daughter, Fay T. Hubbard, 12
years of age.
The complaining witness in the case is
Otto Nolte, a Jeweler at 248 O'Farrell
street. He said that about a year ago
IJubbard's little girl met his own daugh
ter on the street and asked if her parents
would' take her to board. She said her
father would pay for her board and when
Nolte found who her father was he took
her to his home, where she has remained
since.
Nolte said he had made repeated de
mands upon Hubbard for payment for the
girl's board, but had failed to get a cent,
and he had placed the matter in the hands
of the California Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children. The efforts
of the society had met with no better suc
cess?, hence the warrant.
Alaska Appeal Decided.
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals handed down an opinion yesterday
affirming the Judgment of the United
States T)Jstrict Court for the Second Di
vision of Alaska in the case of the Alaska
and Chicago Commercial Company vs. N.
B. Solner. The action was brought to set
aside certain conveyances of real estate
at Nome and for $15,000 damages and
costs. The District Court gave judgment
for Solner.
The death of John Walker, a hotel
keeper at 106 Steuart street,. was reported
to poroner Leland yesterday and an In

broke his collar bone and dislocated his
shoulder on May 15. He was removed to

A Fatal Fall.
ATLANTIC CITY. July 6.â Dr. John D.
Woods of San Rafael, Cal., In whose
house Colonel W. J. Best died recently
under strange circumstances, has been In
Atlantic City several weeks with his wife.
When asked this evening for a statement
In regard to the published charges, he
refused to talk, saying he ) thought It
would be better to remain silent and allow
them to go by default.
Dr. Woods- said that he was in the East
at the time of Colonel Best's death. He
believed that the trouble was due to a
fight of relatives over an estate left by
Colonel Best. He denied that he had in
troduced any woman as his sister.
"I have never been arrested In Atlantic
City on a charge of larceny," he declared.
When shown a statement from the magis
trate's office that a search warrant had
been Issued, he admitted that his baggage
had been Investigated by a constable. He
refused to comment upon this.
From the magistrate it was learned that
the search warrant named several articles
alleged to have been taken by Dr. Woods.
His satchel was identified by one of Col
onel Best's sons, but Mrs. -Woods declared
that the satchel had been given to her
by the dead man.
A note for $1000, which. Woods asserted
had been given them by Colonel Best and
which Mrs. Woods had rent to Sumner
Best in New York, was produced by Sum
ner Best in the presence of the pair and
declared a forgery. It was the evident
desire of Best to have Woods held on ac
count of the note, but the magistrate ex
pressed the opinion-that no warrant could
be issued when no attempt had been made
to collect the money.
Doctor Says He Wasn't Present When
Colonel Best Died.
WOODS MAKES DENIAL.
A resolution was adopted asking the
Mayor to recommend to the Supervisors
the passage of an ordinance giving the
board the power of appointing a cashier.
They then reappointed Murphy as clerk
for thirty days, Commissioner Watt vot
ing no, and Biedermann resumes his po
sition as repairer.
Fire Commissioner Parry received a re
buke at the hands of the Police and Fire
Commissioners, sitting as a Board of

THE LATE COLONEL W. J. BEST. WHO DIED RECENTLY IN SAN RA
FAEL. AND WHOSE SON MAKES CHARGE OF MURDER AGAINST
PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM.
One of the most substantial details ob
tained during the Investigation of the
case is the statement of Miss Minnie
Naghettl, who was a servant for the
Woods during their sojourn here. She in
formed Attorney Boyd that she saw Dr.
Woods give Colonel Best a hypodermic
Injection of something the day before he
died. Dr. W. F. Jones of this city, who
signed, the certificate of death declaring
that Best died of apoplexy, admitted to
Attorney Boyd that upon one occasion
he noticed Colonel Best was breathing
very hard and that his eyes were pecu
liarly dull, but at that time he was not
suspicious.
The son of Colonel Best, who now wants
Woods and his sister arrested, resides at
Grand View, Hudson. N. Y. He is secre
tary of the Alfred N. Best Company of
New York City.
In view of the above? and of the conflicting
â¢ statements of Woods and Mrs. Wood, regard-
Ing their names, the death of relatives, and
their relationship, and other unexplained mis
statements, and of the fact that said John
Donald Woods, now claiming to be the hut
band of Alice Cloy Wood, . was engaged to be
married to a young woman In San Rafael,
Cal., when they were residing in that place,
und represented hlmrelf at that time as a
bachelor, and the brother of Alice Cloy Wood,
and of the further fact that they had in their
possession at Atlantic City, N. J.. stolen ar
ticlen, formerly the property of William J.
Best, deceased;' and that the writer and many
others familiar with the handwriting of the
raid William J. Best, deceased, are convinced
that the note upon which the *ald Alice Cloy
Wood endeavored to secure certain valuable
collateral, namely, five thousand shares ot
the stock of the Gordon Tiger Mining and Re
duction Company, Is a forgery: and of the final
and most Important fact that there are grave
reafon* to believe that my father, Wil
liam J. Best, mot his death by foul
means at the hands of John Donald Woods and
Alice Cloy Wood, or with their connivance,
I respectfully request that warrants be is
sued for the arrest of John Donald Woods and
Alice Cloy Wood, on the charge of grand lar
ceny, attempt to obtain money under false pre
tensre, and forgery, and that they be appre
hended bdI dealt with according to law, and
held peniir.R the result of an autopsy upon the
body of William J. Best, in Essex County,
New Jersey, that they may be forthcoming
to answer to the charge of murder should such
autopsy show caure for such action.
All the above charges are substantiated by
the accompanying affidavit, and are to the
brst of the writer's knowlpdge and belief. I
have Just heard from the Prosecuting Attorney
of Essex County. New Jrr?ey, that he cannot
take action in this case until advised by you,
so 1 presume the autopsy will have to be made
at our expense. It might be well for you to
communicate with Dr. W. J. Jones of San
R&fael who Issued the certificate of death,
as he could likely Rive valuable Information in
resard to this ca?e. 1 have writtrn him for a
statement of the facts, but there has not been
time for a reply.
Trusting that you will give this your Im
mediate attention, and awaiting your Â»nv|ce. 1
am very respectfully. C. SUMNER BEST.
There was no autopsy held after Colonel
Best died, and his body was embalmed
and shipped East, whert; It was buried on
April 24. District Attorney Thomas P.
Boyd has been making a thorough Inves
tigation of the circumstances surrounding
the death. He has ordered the body ex
humed at Morrlstown, N. J., and on au-
I topsy held to determine, if possible, the

Nervous Prostration"
Faint Spells.
Dr. Miles' Nervine Saved
My Life. /
There is great danger in a run down con-
dition. Overwork, mental strain, the cares
and worries of business and the home, all
have a deleterious effect upon the nerves,
which in their devitalized condition readily
fall prey to the attacks of disease. Aside
from the danger there is no condition at-
tended by so many disagreeable symptoms;
such as loss of appetite, indigestion or nerv-
ous dyspepsia, headache, tired feeling and
loss of ambition together with the agony of
sleepless nights .spent in tossing restlessly
about, only to rise exhausted in the morning.
Dr. Miles Nervine is a tiue nerve tonic
which, by strengthening the nerves, restores
health and appetite and brings sweet sleep.
"For six years I suffered almost constantly
from a complication of troubles which culmi-
nated in complete nervous prostration. I
had no appetite, I could not sleep, I suffered
from indigestion and nervousness. As is so
often the case in nervous prostration I f re-
ouently had weak, fainting spells. Doctors
did not help me. They said my blood was
very poor, and I know my. face was always
very pale. /The very first bottle of Dr. Miles'
Nervine I took gave me noticeable relief and
F felt stronger- than I had in .' years. - My
neighbors in Puyallup, Wash., where. I then
lived will testify to this. I also used some of
Dr. Miles' Restorative Tonic and Anti-Pain
Pill*. I believe the Dr. Miles Remedies
saved my life."â Mrs. J. C. Benedict; Tuck-

Arm Mangled in Woolen Carder.
Barbara Stoker, 19 years of age, who is
employed in the Golden Gate Woolen
Mills at Nineteenth and Bryant streets,
had her right arm" badly mangled in a
woolen carder yesterday. The accident
occurred while the young, woman was In
the act of feeding wool into the machine.
She was removed to the City and County
Hospital for treatment and later to her
home at 1022 Hampshire street.
Child Injured by Fall.
Hazel Tyson, .the 3-year-old daughter of
Charles H. Tyson, a hoseman in the city
Fire Department and residing at 5a Tre
mont avenue, had the bone of her right

playing in Golden Gate Parli. The acci
dent was caused by the child falling from
one of the swings in the children's play
ground. The child . was removed, to the
Park Emergency Hospital , for, treatment.
â¢ CAIRO, Ej?ypt. July Â«.â The "Assouan reser

of .water for the first time. The results are
most satisfactory.' The . area of cotton is
largely Increased and the success of fhe'uunl
mer crops Is ancured In the entire area trib
utary tg' the dam.
Crowds of the curious hung: about the
scene to-day wondering whether bodies
of unfortunate . victims were, buried be
neath the debris, blackened timbers and
charred remains of the structure. Noth
ing was done by Chief Ball toward dig
ging Into. the ruins after he had been In
formed by Mrs. Evans that all her room
ers were safe. Â¦" .- .
Individual losers by the fire started on
their own account to search for theif val
uables. First on the scene was Ljubro
bratich, the restaurant man, who took a
foreÂ© of men into the lot and aftej locat
ing his safe dug it out and had the warped
steel door cut open.
The contents of the etrong-box, include
It wag during the firemen's fight against
the flames on the north side that Parker,
Sieotte and Barr were caught. They had
led In a stream through C. W. Kohl's'sa
loon to attack the tiro and to make an
effort to check its epread through the
wooden block adjoining, when the srash
of burning timbers caught them.
NO SEARCH FOR BODIES.
GIVES THE ALARM,
As soon as he saw the flames he rushed
Into the restaurant closed the safe and
then rushed upstairs, giving the alarm
Grease-soaked and old. the frame struct
ure was in a mass of flames, the rear
being all afire from basement to roof in
an incredibly short time. It was unfor
tunate that tho fire should have started
while the centrally located apparatus was
busy at the Webpter-stre- 1 fire. Only
seventeen minutes elapsed between the
time the first alarm for the Webster-street
fire was sounded and the sending In of
the first box for the Arcata House.
Engine No. 1 and Hose No. L whose
house Is on Fifteenth street, not one hun
dred feet from the scene of the Arcata
House fire, were at Webster street, as
also was Chemical Company No. J, which
Is located on Thirteenth and Webster
ftreets, three blocks distant. When box
5â¬, San Pablo avenue and Sixteenth street,
was turned In from the fire department
quarters the nearest apparatus was En
gine 5. at Market and Milton streets, and
Engine 3, Truck 3 and Hose 3, at Eighth
and Willow streets. These responded, but
by the time they could get to work the
lodging-house was all in' flames. Chief
Ball sounded a general alarm as soon as
he arrived from the Webster-street fire
that brought out the entire department
except one chemical engine in East Oak
land and an engine he left ' at Webster
and Second streets to handle that fire. It
was excellent work on the part of the
department that saved the long row of
one-story buildings on San Pablo avenue
north of the Arcata House from destruc
tion and kept the threatening flames from
Ewceping the entire block in that direc
tion.
There is much speculation concerning
the cause of the fire. Chief Ball is in
vestigating, and Chief of Police Hodgkins
has detailed Detectives Quigley and Hol
land to round up the facts concerning the
outbreak. Evidence appears to point to
the rear of the San Pablo Avenue restau
rant, situated on the street floor of the
Arcata House, as the scene of the out
burst. Michael Ljubrobratich, the pro
prietor, was away when the fire broke'

Detectives Bunner and Reilly, who have

believe that the shots were deliberately
fired at Mrs. Romani. She was seated at
a window in the lower Sat when the first
bullet crashed through it, close to her

out of the window to see who had fired
the shot two other bullets crashed

Italian Fisherman Arrested for

He Was Celebrating.
IÂ«uigi IAh, the Italian fisherman, living

having tired three shots from a rifle Sat
urday nijrht at Mrs. L.. Romani of Sll
Montgomery avenue, wife of thfÂ» proprie

Ho denies that he fired the shots at Mrs.
Romani. He says he had been drinking;
and as he wanted to celebrate Indepen
dence day. he took his rifle and tired three
shots at the fence separating his yard
from the yard of Mrs. Romani's resi
dence. Ho had never spoken to Mrs. Ro

kill her. He also denies that he had been
guilty of insulting conduct toward Mrs.
Romani. fc
I would far rather be a sinner und b<? sin
cere than a dinner whose sfn has not been
found out; for the only sin I know of Is the
thought of sin, and therefore I deny it that
it Is a sin to do that which I may desire to
do. which hurts no self or thing. If I let every
other entity than mine alone I will be at peace
with all the world.
LIA CLAIMS HE DID NOT
INTEND TO MURDER HER
In "my play. "The Unmasking," I
have striven to depict society, according to
the present impossible and Imperious criterion
of morality, as that delflcally magnanimous
man of Nazareth declared: "Whoso is without
sin among you, let him cast the first stone."
As for myself, I feel quite safe within my
house of glass; there Is not one to cast a stone.
I have striven to depict the comparative In
consequence of sin and the lncomparabla con
sequentlallty of forgiveness.
The drama is not a thing or froth. It Is
an art of fact as vitalized as life. The world
need* men. And I still believe that the world
wants men who are intensely In earnest. In
tensity of purpose is a synonym of %uccess..
Flippancy Is cue for failure. Modesty cannot
keep me from saying that I am proud of my
sincerity. I am sincerely in earnest In my
profession. I am possibly more interested la
dramatic construction than In dramatic ex
pression. I am an advocate of the play with
a purpose â the problem play. Mediocrity ta
boos sociology in the drama; It praises the
prettyâ -I do not.
SINCERITY OF PURPOSE.
Immortals, while the names of the players of
Aeschylus are unwritten, and. If written, are
erased by the wear, of the ages upon the pages
of histrionic history. Nor can the player ever
claim a ri;:ht to live until the drama shall
become essentially identified with a .moral
motif: then shall immortality be the players'
epilogue.
The Bard of Avon has written the poem, of
the play and only the pessimist- deems the mute
of genius dÂ«ad. Shakespeare, Lytton, Goethe
shall live again. Hallock, Garrlck. Keane
shall turns surpassing understudies. The maÂ»K
shall play Its part in the drama of the world
with the cross, the sword, the beacon and tha
scepter. The drama U not demoralized: It Is
too juvenile to judge. Its childish pranks and
lapses from dignity will be cut out when Its
make-up of character Is on.
Such masterpieces as "The Second Mr!.
Tanqueray," "Iris." "The Joy of Living" and
"The Climbers" and "Ghosts" are as potent
sermons as ever foil from the lips of tee dom
inie. Thus the might of Melpomene has not
been guessed. She shall become a handmaid of
the God of gods, the ministering angel of the
sorrowing and the cherubim of joy.
FORMER OAKLAND MINISTER,
WHO IS NOW A FULL
FLEDGED ACTOR.
The Supervisors, after nearinjr the
reading of the Assessor's Mter, 'decided
to take "up the matter of. the assessment
on. Tuesday evening, July,14, at 8 o'clock,
and to sit at that time as a board of
equalization. : .;
In conclusion. I desire to express my grati
fication at the peaceful relations now existing
between this deoartment and the city's largest
taxpayersâ notably. ~ our quasi-public cor
porations. Peace has been secured during the
past year with the last contestant, and taxes
will now be paid without lltlrattun or pro
test and without the. city havlne lost any of
the rights for which we have contended. Such
relations, when possible, between a municipal
ity and aggregate capital, without' n sacrifice
of the rights'of either, are most desirable and
beneficial. Very respectfully yours,
WASHINGTON IJODGE, Assessor.
In addition to the assessment of property,
this office has. during the- past ninety days,
collected and turned In la the eitv treasury,
an tar."! 1 on unsecured personal property, the.
sum of $G8:Â».0C0. s
Th* collections to date of roll taxes for this
year amount to $107,532. This Is tfie largest
sum ever collated from this sourre and will
enrich the city treasury to the amount of
$16,130;' this J"im being the. fees fÂ»l lowed by
the .State for collection and formerly enjoyed
by the Assessor.
LARGE SUMS COLLECTED.
During tho first years 'of my term out-lying
roal estate and that in certain sections, which
had been previously over-assessed; together
with such real estate as had actually dspre
ciated in value,' was reduced In. thÂ« aggregate
ever ?R.6OO,00*>. This makes the total reduc
tions In the assessment roll granted during
five years on over-assessed property $22,000.
000. This large reduction lias b'.on over
come by the Increases made In the assessment
of real estate in favored sections, and by the
assessment of newly constructed buildings.
Notwithstanding these largp reductions,
amounting, as stated, to $22,000,000, the as
sessment roll has been increased during my
term $74.OOl>,O<x>. This has Increased the rev
enue of the city $740.<XX> a ypar. and assisted

had previously escaped imseysment. There is
thus produced Â« large extra revenue- for the
city without an increase of the burden of tax

Incumbency of this office, thp personal prop

no Increase. During those six years It aver

AN INCREASE .OF REVENUE.
As this report is the last to be made by me
during my terra of office, and as the assess
ment of this year' marks the completion of a
vast amount of revisionary work undertaken
by me three years ago, 1 beg leave at this
.time to give a brief eummary of the changes
made In the city's assessment. t?oon after
assuming this office it was discovered that
there existed the sross^st inequality In \ the
assessment of buiidinge; many old buildings,
especially dwellings, being assessed in excess
of their full cash value. A complete revision
of the assessment of all such property was
therefore undertaken. This work has taken
four years to complete, as every building in
this city has been inspected and revalued.
The. necaÂ«Â«ity "for such -a .revaluation, is shown
by the amount of Hike â¢ reductions wbtch';were
found to be warranted^ * THeSe reductions' in
the assessed valuation of dwellings have in
three years amounted In ; the aggiegate. to
$1. "1.500, 0Â»X>, and such reductions have been
granted o.n over 25.000.buildlng?.u. . .;Â¦â¢Â»,

To commemorate the twenty-seventh
anniversary of their victory at the Cen
tennial world's shooting contest in lSTS,
tho four surviving members of the cham
pion team from the California Schuetzen
Club held a reunion anil banquet last
night at a downtown report. The old
marksmen who gathered to recall the
days of their triumphs were Philo Jacoby,
A. Strecker, A. Rahwyler and William
Ehrenpfort, G. L. Mayerhofer and G. B.
Faktor being the guests of honor.
These surviving mark3men, together
with three who have since passed away,
composed thp. team from the California
Schuetzen Club, then In its infancy,
which surprised all of the world's best
marksmen at the Philadelphia Exposition
by carrying off-the honors In the interna
tional target Hhooting by the score of 68
rings, thereby winning (he championship
cup, which has since remained in the pos
session of the local club.
At the banquet last night the memories
of the old times were refreshed by the
presence of the original. targets on which
the winning shots were recorded at Phila
delphia.' Philo Jacoby, the founder of iiie
successful club, acting ofl toastmasÂ«ter,

It Is never too late to change professions
if we change a bad one for a good one, or.
if bad, in a good Â«if, we change to become
better In a bad one. A poet might well change
his vocation to become a plovAnan, If so late
in life he should find out that he could lay
a deeper furrow than a thought. I have ex
changed a cross for a innsk, but there may be
more truth- behind a mask, which appears' to
be naught but a sham, than behind a face
which seems to be aglow with glory, when,
if the truth wÂ«?re known, it Is but a calcium
light effect of godliness. I deem It to
be true unto a sham than to sham a truth;
better to be true unto a mask than to be un
true to 8. cross.
Meanwhile the people are talking about
the change of profession of Mr. Davis.
This is the unique statement that Mr.
Davis himself makes upon this point:
has just closed a contract with
the Mordant-Humphries Company, and
two weeks from to-night will appear on
the stage in his home city, where he once
preached, as the leading man in a play
of his own writing.
Since leaving Oakland and his pastorate
in this city several years ago, Mr. Davis
has taken up the stage as his profession.
A short time ago he returned to Oakland
to visit his parents, who still reside here.
He has now closed his contract with Ed
win Mordant, whose company opened, at
the Macdonough Theater to-night in "The
Christian." Mr. Mordant will present
"The Wife" next week, and the week
following will be the* first performance
of "The Unmasking," which is the title
Mr. Davis has given to his play. The play
has been pronounced excellent, but upon
that point the Oakland friends of Mr.
Davis will have an opportunity to judge
for themselves.
OAKLAND, July 6.â Edwards Davis,
formerly the pastor of the First
Christian Church of this city and
' an Oakland boy born and reared,
Thf sUamer Morninar, which returned f>
Lyttelton on March 25 with Lieutenant Shakti
ton conveyed to the world the news that Cap
tain Scott. Dr. Wilson and Lieutenant Shakel
torr after many hardships, had reached lati
tude S2 dÂ«greÂ«Â» 17 minute* south, longitude \Kl
degree west, which is 94 miles south of th
permanent location â¢ of the Discovery. Th*
party returned to its vessel on January 28.
190.1. thus penetrating farther south than any
other **p:orers. The record of HÂ»rr Borchgre
vinck at Southern Crom was 7S degrees CO
minutes south. The winter quarters of thÂ«s
Dlscovtry are at Cape Armitage in latitude
74 minutes 4!* seconds south, longitude 183 d<*
dreea KJ minutes west.* Th* spot was cleared
of one yearn Ice early In February. Captain
Scott resorted to mÂ« that the Ice this year
waa much later, but we hoped to eventually
free his ship.
Captain Colbeck says that he expecta to
return to the Discovery about the* second
week in December. He reports that the
Swedish Antarctic expedition has gone to
Terra del Fuego, where it will winter and
carry on its scientific work.
As to the claim of the Germans that
they had reached 60 degrees 30 minutes,
as reported In the cablegram from Cape
town, Captain Colbeck said:
The theory that communication might
have been effected by land I also regard Â»Â»
unreasonable. A sledga Journey over 1400
miles of Ice would have to be made inside of
two months. an<l. moreover, even supposing
the Gauss had been farther south, aa was re
ported, the Discovery la hidden on the west
by mountain*, and as the Germans could not
have known Just where the British were win
tering, it 13 hard to imagine that the former
rould hav^ reached the Discovery by land. 1
have several Jimes thought that the Gauss
fell In with tSe Scotch exploring vessel Scotia
and mistook her for the Discovery. Possibly
the vessel supposed to be the Discovery was
only sighted instead of spoken and In this way
her name wai not learned.
It is my opinion that It is highly improbable
that the Gauss could be got around to thÂ»
position where the Discovery wu lying. ,lt
the cablegram concerning the Gauss were true.
It would mean that the Discovery wm free
from the Ice, and such being the case you
would have heard of her at Lyttelton before
now. At the time we left her the Discovery
had had communication with no vessel other
than the Morning. When we left her Captain
Scott was confident that he would be atjle
to free his vessel this season.
The German station in the South Pole
exploration, he explained, was in east
longitude, between Victoria Land, the
section assigned to the British expedition,
and the Weddell Sea, the Scottish section.
To the west of the German portion are
the Kemp Land and Enderby Land
both on the Antarctic Circle, and to the
east is Knox Land, which is also on the
circle*. It may be, said the captain, that
the land discovered by the German expe
dition will be found to be continuous with
the three points mentioned already. Said
he:
-Nothing definite has been heard from
the Discovery since the Morning left her
early in the. year in her winter quarters,
but Captain- Colbert says that there is
every reason for believing that her HtOe
band of. explorers will not suffer for want
before another expedition reaches them.
The Morning left the Discovery well pro
visioned and her people in good health.
The story of the experiences of the Dis
covery party was fully told in The Call
about a month ago, when Lieutenant
Shackelton passed through here on hla
way to London, bearing the first report
ofxthe expedition.
Meanwhile the Morning ha3 been lying
at anchor at Christchurch, N. Z., await
ing the British Parliament's action on the
question of another relief expedition to
Cape Armitage. Consequently Captain
Colbeck Is able to furnish no further de
tails of the Icebound Discovery than have
already been published. On June 2 last,
shortly after Lieutenant Shackelton
passed through San Francisco, the Ger
man Antarctic exploration vessel Ganss
arrived at Cape Town, after being ice
bound for a year, and reported having
reached 60 degrees 30 minutes south and
communicated with the Discovery. Con
cerning this report Captain Colbeck said
last evening that he seriously doubted the
news.
Captain William Colbeck, commander of
the British steamship Morning, which
was dispatched on a mission of relief to
the exploration steamer Discovery and
eventually found her firmly bound in the
ice near the southerly extremity of Cape
Armitage,, from "where he carried Lieu
tenant Shackelton back to Lyttelton on
March. 25 last, was a passenger on the
steamer Sonoma, - which arrived here
yesterday. Captain Colbeck Is bound for
London to report to the Royal Geograph
ical Society and' his Government on the
feasibility of making another visit to the
Discovery next December. Parliament
has already approved an appropriation of
Â£40,000 for the trU>.
The total of this year's roll is *427,452.11O.
This is a net gain" of $7,483,466 over the
amount of the roll of 1002. To secure this
net jraln required, however, the, addition of
over $20,000,000 of assessable property to last
year's roll. Thla is explained by the fact that
the losses on certain classes of personal prop
erty thia year, together with the reductions
made by me on old dwellings, amounted to
over $13,000,000. These losses and i-alns are
shown in detail in the following- tablp;

The increased value of realty in certain
sections has been the chief factor this year
in producing an enlarged assessment roll: the
large sum of $l6,88t$,0v0 having been added to
the assessment . of real estate and improve
ments. V '
The assessment roll for the ensuing fis
cal year for the city and county of San
Francisco was presented to the Board of
Supervisors yesterday by Dr. Washington
Dodge, City and County Assessor.
More than 100 ponderous books were
brought into the chamber of the Board of
Supervisors by clerks of the Assessor.
These volumes represent the wprk of four
years and the records will be open to the
public who desire to inspect the figures
of Dr. Dodge's' office.
The Board of Supervisors will sit as a
board of equalization and hear all appli
cations that may be made for a reduction
of the assessment on real and personal
property.

r.ot Ftudy at night at all and would wake
In the morning with heavy headaches.

cheaper food, for my resources were al-
most exhausted. To my Burprise every

The passengers included the following
named:
The Sonoma encountered unpleasant
weather almost throughout the voyage.
Head winds and head seas were encoun
tered between Honolulu and this port.
She was 20 days 19 hours from Sydney
and 5 days 20 hours from Honolulu.
Robert Theodore Cox. the 14 months old
child of one of the passengers, eiied on
board June IS and was buried at sea.
Mr?. G. A. Hodson, wife of the liner's
purser, was a passenger on the Sonoma
and will devote the nine days the steam-
Ehip remains In port to verifjing her hus
band's reports as to the climatic and
other attractions of California.
The Sonoma brought a large number of
passengers, among them many promi
nent colonials. She left Honolulu two
cays after the Pacific Mail Company's
City of Peking and the third day out
caught up to and passed that relic of
early days. The Peking, fast and com
modious some thirty years ago, seem* to
be pelting slower every voyage. She is
coming from the islands at the dignified
gait of about eight knots an hour and
frhould be- here in time for her passengers
to iand on Wednesdav.
The Oceanic Steamship Company broke j
the record yesterday for rapid handling I
of mail. The liner Sonoma reached port j
from Australia late in the afternoon with
â¢ZGi bags of Australian-British mail. The j
Quarantine inspection and the taking up J
of passengers' declarations by Custom
house officials occupied valuable time and
it was 5:50 o'clock when the liner came j
alongside Pacific-street wharf. Before
Ute lines were fast the mail was sliding j
down a rapidly rigged chute into the j
sturdy arms of a picked squad of long- j
shoremen. As the burly stevedore* hustled i
the heavy bags Into waiting trucks a \
staff of cierks and officials tallied the I
consignment and by the time the trucks j
weie loaded the paper* accompanying the ;
mail were checked up and ready to be i
turned over to the next custodian of the i
precious freight. At 5:50 o'ejock the first
bag of mail slid down the chute and the j
whole shipment went to Oakland, where
it was transferred to the overland train j
Jiv the- 6 o'clock boat. â¢
The State Board of Pilot Commissioners held
Us regular monthly meeting yesterday morn
ing. It reneÂ»Â«d a few licenses and transacted
rome routine .business and the members drÂ«w
their salaries. They made no appointments.

To-morrow evening the Grand Jury will
resume the taking of testimony concern
ing the acts of the â¢ Eppingers and Ett
linger. A large amount of information
may be extracted from books of the com
pany which are available.' It is claimed
now that the grain that is missing may
be traced with accuracy by the books in
the possession of' Receiver Wadsworth.
The entries on the books of Eppinger &
Co. show what lot of wheat or barley, ac
cording to marks, was pledged for any
loan and this is essential information that
the grand jurors now need. Several wit
nesses from* Crockett will testify to-mor
row night, among them Freund. the book
keeper of the Pacific Coast Warehouse
Company, and McFaull, the weigher of
grain at the warehouses at Crockett.
New witnesses are also to be summoned.
A meeting of the creditors of Eppinger
& Co. will ba called this week . for the
purpose of appointing a trustee to. take
charge of the assets. The probability ls
that Henry Wadsworth. who ls now the
receiver, will be elected the trustee.
There are a few small creditors whoae
names are not already known. The bulk
of the indebtedness ls with the bank? of
San Francisco and the Interior and is ev
idenced mainly by warehouse certificates,
although one bank, the London, Paris and
American, is secured by real estate. Hen
ry Wadsworth ls receiver of Eppinger &
Co. in the Federal courts, the decision
concerning jurisdiction tavlng touched
only the Pacific Coast Warehouse Com
pany. He is also receiver in the State
court in the suit brought by the Xevada
National Bank against the Anglo-Califor
nlan Bank and others.

The Best Way East
If you enjoy' grand scenery there's
only one way for you to go east â via
Salt Lake City, Denver and the Bur-
lington Route, the scenic line across
the continent '
Burlington tourist cars by thi3 way
leave California three times a week for
the East. There are no changes or
delays â you go right through to Omaha
and Chicago, or Kansas City and
St. Louis. Connections at these cities
for all points beyond.
Scenic attractions are not all â will be
glad to tell you about the others.
Call if you can, bat write me a line
if you can't Â¦'

HONOLULU, June 30.â Japanese fisher

way Islands . by tens of thousands, and
Captain Redman drove them away twice
during his trip there on the Iroquols. He
has asked Governor Dole t. issue a proc
lamation prohibiting: the taking of birds
from any. of the Hawaiian Islands group
between here and Midway, where he
found a party of thirty-seven Japanese
bird . killers. The Japanese pull out the
feathers they want and then throw away
the birds, often leavins them to starve
and die on the beach. The Japanese left
Midway in a small schooner, but Captain
Rodman found them again on Lisiansky
Island, slaughtering; birds. He ordered
them away from that place.

CHICAGO. July 6.â A reaction occurred In
wheat, and, although trading was quiet, price*
were strong: throughout the entire session. The
opening was higher on a sharp advance in the
July options and Liverpool and. on the rather
discouraging foreign advices, the reports from
Russia being quite bullish. September was tip
UÂ«t%c at the start, and. with a good commis
sion demand, with little for sale, the market
became steadier. September advancing to 85%9
S5?tC. Later the offerings became freer and
much of tbe early gain was lost, September
declining to 75Â®75VtC but during the laat hour
the buying was renewed and the market again
advanced. A' decrease In the visible supply of
1.4Sn,(XX> bushels was partly responsible for
the better demand late In the day. After sell
ing up to 76c September closed l%o higher at
7514c. . Â¦ ' ' Â¦
A bullish sentiment pervaded the com pit
and . there waa a good - general demand the
greater part of the day. After selling be
tween 51%c and 50%c September closed l%c
higher at 51Â«c. - .
Oats were also influenced by the unfavorable
crop reports from the, country and active cov
ering 1 by local shorts, together with buying. for
Investment account, caused a strong market.

With the exception of Cherries, which were
very scarce, all descriptions of small tree
fruits were in ample supply and the mntkft
generally had an easy tone. The river boat*
arrived on time and as receipts from that sec

moved slowly. RÂ»oelifts of Figs were too
heavy for trie market to absorb and prWs de

Visible Grain Supply
NEW TORK. July 6.â The explanation was
offered of the extreme dullness of last Fri
day's etock market that many members who
wanted a holiday on Friday had Ignored the
session of the exchange and had gone away
on vacation trips. This explanation was sup
plemented to-day by the further suggestion
that the members have not yet returned from
their vacations. There Is very little more to
; be said of the day's market, which showed no
larger aggregate of transaction than that of
last Friday. The few members present on the
! floor were almost idle, and the small trading
; among UtemFrlves was Hrtlers and Inconne
i quentlal. There was an aimless drift of prices.

i makin? th*> closing tone- easy, but the averape

Chicago was lower on the day. with the trade
bearish as to the future. The Chicago letter
of Bolton, DÂ« Ruyter & Co. said: "Market Js
again dull and easy. The expected July im
provement in demand has not so far appeared
to any appreciable extent. Receipts of hogs
continue liberal and speculative Interest Is
slow. The larger packers are probably hope
ful .of a little better prices, but the price still
looks high to us, and we think a long look
ahead means materially lower prices."

Those greedy for the new sensation
should not miss "Kidnaped." It should be
said, however, that most of the Central
bills are equally Joys of living. To get
the full and particular flavor , of "Kid
naped" I recommend . the , gallery, by
preference, where the small -boy; like' the
Blessed Damosel. leans, out ... from his
heaven. A dime buys the. seat, a nickel
the essential peanut. Below, in the more
aristocratic balcony, there is mommer
and the wide-eyed baby, popper with the
other one on his -knee. There Is Mamie
and her "steady," the unattached maiden
(In pairs), the, giddy bachelor (in bunches).
Old age and youth are there, all sorts and
conditions of folks, but not '<a'*blase; face
among 'em. 'They are there to enjoy; and
how they do enjoy! And WHAT they do
enjoy !â which, after all, ' is foreign to the
question.- â¢-Â¦-.- '. . ' â¢ "
The hero of "Kidnaped" is an artist
(Edwin Emery), who wishes nobly to
marry an heiress, but regrets her money.
Her popper has, however, done the thing
he should not, and thus placed ; himself
in the power of the villain. Naturally,,
the villain wishes to marry the maid, but
"beautifully"â as Hedda G abler has .it
has already a wife' In the background.
The right to the foreground of these fig
ures is, however, hotly contested by Po
liceman McMooney (James Corrigan), his
Â¦wife, his daughterâ who are on terms of
blood-brotherhood with the heiress, and a
young Dutchman, who says "chess" : for
"yes." \; ; : â¢.-â¢;'. , : Â¦;. Â¦
The villain threatens to pu*. the thumb
screw on popper, who then, gently coerces
daughter to promise to marry hjm. . t Tho
villain's wife then drops in In an offhand

one thing about the Central Theater: if

you get it: if there is a "leap for life"

leap and life and train; if there is a mur

Everybody does nobly, James Corrigan

NEEDS LOCAL SIGNERS
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July 6.â
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford, in company with
her brother. Charles G. Lathrop, and his
family, went from the university this
morning for a week's visit to Tosemite
Valley. They will be conveyed in their
private car to Raymond. .;..'Â¦*
Many of the students come to this university
because the advantages are free and because
they know they will be obliged to carve out
their own future, and with the encouragement
which we will give these, departments in the
future they may gladly pursue this course of
study. The professional world has more than
Its quota, while the manual has still room for
more skilled workmen. When you put on the
armor end take up the work where I leave It
I charge you to pay special attention to these
departments. Let the laborer always keep be
fore him these words of our precious Savior:
â¢"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work."
In the next place I would Impress on you thÂ«
importance of a subject near my heart â that
of <-conomy being taught the students. A stu
dent will be better fitted to battle with the
trials and tribulations of life If he or she has
been taught the worth of money, the necessity
of saving and of overcoming a desire to Imi
tate those who are better off in the world's
goods. For. when he has learned how to save
and how to control Incrdinate desires, he will
be relatively rich. During the past three and
a half ye.ars of close observation on my part
the importance of economy has Impressed Itself
forcibly upon me and I wish It to be taught
to all students of the university.
Â»
Departs for Yosenute.
It was a theory of my husband that the labor
of a man whose brain has been developed in
conjunction with skilled hands made him eo
superior to the ordinary workman as to en
able him to command the highest compensa
tion. He also felt that the presence of these
departments In the university tended to greatly
dignify labor.
MANUAL TRAINING.
The next subject to which I would call your
special interest and attention in the future is
the mechanical departments. I know full well
how important my husband considered these
departments. The large workshops were fitted
up at an enormous expense with the very
finest and best machinery and tools. During
the first two years there were over a. hundred
students busily engaged in learning how to use
their hands deftly and usefully In the machine
shops. This number, from some cause which
we cannot understand, has be*n eteadily de
creasing from year to year.
I am convinced that a larger and more com
modious library building is required, and it will
Rive me great pleasure, if I am spared, to erect
this in the future.
Another suggestion which I have given much
thought is not at present to begin new depart
ments in the university, but strengthen and
l^rfect those already commenced, preferring
rather to discontinue the weak: not to be am
bitious as to large numbers of students; not
to try to keep up in numbers of professors or
students with such universities as Yale. Har
vard. Cornell or our rwn excellent State Uni
versity, all of which so largely outnumber
Stanford. I myself preff r to keep within the
limit of fifteen hundred or two thousand for a
few years to come; to give students an extra
quality of <-ducation and to *ma out each year
master minds and skilled' workmen from Btrong
departments that they in their turn may fill
places of credit to themselves and to the uni
versity they represent. There are already too
many universities that are attempting more
than they can do with the best results.
UNIVERSITY GROWTH.
needful increases in the annual appropriation
for salaries and other fixed changes as the
finances of the university have warranted. Hy
persistently resisting the natural tendency of
the fixed expenses of universities to absorb
the whole income, or even to exceed it, I
have been enabled to provide such buildings and
equipment as the needs of the university have
demanded.

FUTURE POLICIES.
Mrs.' Stanford's inaugural address is in
part as follows;
The subject of student employment has been
Ciscuw-d between us and I found your opin
ions coincided with my own. which are de
rived from personal experience and observa
tion. There should never be any partiality
In furnishing employment to students at the
expense of the university, nor should students
be employed merely to enable them to avail
themselveb of the advantages offered by the
university. This ie r.ot what Jhe founders in
tended, which was to griv* an eduration only,
and it should never be allowed. I have found
the eyrUm of student errplorm^nt to be in
most cases very unratisfartory. expensive and
usually very unreliable, because of th<>ir du
ties 8f etudents continually calling them away
from their work.
The board adopted a temporary organ
ization in accordance with the sugges
tions in Mre. Stanford's address and ap
pointed a committee upon permanent or
ganization.
Mrs. Stanford then delivered an inau
gural address in which she discussed a
gr^at many matters of general policy,
upon which she felt Qualified to speak
by reason of her ten years of experience,
and also such matters as she considered
likely to ccme before the board during
her term as president.
The trustees present were Horace
Davis, Justice T. B. McFarland, George
E, Gray. Joseph D. Grant. S. F. Lelb.
Lecn Sloss, Charles G. Lathrop, George
E. Crothers and Mrs. Stanford.

Judge S. F. Leib of San Jose tendered
his resignation as president of the board
and Mrs. Stanford was unanimously se
lected for the vacant position. Subse
quently Judge Loib was unanimously se
lected as vice-DresiÂ«2cnt.
It lias been Mrs. Stanford's intention to
retire entirely from active participation
in the affairs of the university and to
that end when the meeting was called
to order the delivered the following fare
well address;
On retiring from the active management
of affairs connected with the university allow
me to Bay that in the past I have endeavored
to put into all my work my truest self. I
havÂ« learned to love this work so sacredly en
trusted to my care. Through trying and
unique experiences rr.y lift- has been bi ought
nearer to others who carried burden?. I rec
ognize we all have human hearts, and it has
called out fnr faith In God, and in this way I
have been lÂ«-d and sustained by Go,l, and I
can now pay truly that I am thankful to the
aii-wis* and lovinjr father for his leading.*
I realize fully the prrcat change that will
come to nip from being rt-Ieaeod from active
mental life *o one of quiet and peace, conse
quently I have iiiannei to go away to othar
pcenes in foreign lards for a year or two and*
divert mjwelf throuph my eyes.
I K>v.> no regrets whatever in taking the
action I have to release myself from and
turn over to you the tfTairs of the university.
You have my entire confidence in ycur ability
*nd in ycur determination to do earnest, oon
â¢sclentious work to the very best advantage
to ..he students, they to be considered para
mount to tÂ»!l and everything else. The same
pood father Tih^ guides and rules all will
continue his watchful, loving care. He knows
the work was inaugurated through love for
humanity. iuvi love for humanity must ever
be the university's tnotto as long: as time
lasts
WILL TKAVEL TWO YEAHS.
The determination of the trustees to
elect her as president of the board ar.d
their persistent appeals for her to accept
the position caused her to change her
determination to retire permanently, from
a-tlve participation in the government of
the university, but it is Mrs. Stanford's
intention to go abroad for two years and
spend the timp in rest and travel. Dur
ing that period the affairs of the univer

It is also alleged that Mrs. Moxley was
unable to spell her name, and had to ask
the nurse in attendance to spell it for her.
It is alleged that Lydia H. Mooney and
Ella H. Mooney poisoned her mind
against' all other relatives by telling her
that a!I the other relatives wanted was
her money and did not care for her other
wise. The document also states that dur
ing a period of six months prior to her
death Mrs. Moxley told several persons
that she was afraid of Lydia H. and Ella
H. Mooney.
Carrie Talbot, a niece of the late Eliza
beth W. H. Moxley, who died recently
leavir.g an estate valued at $100,000,' filed
a contest to decedent's last will and tes
tament yesterday through her attorney,
Edwin L. Forster. The contestant alleges
that the deceased was under the undue
Influence of Lydia H. Mooney, her sister,
and Ella H. Mooney, her niece. Contest
ant further asserts that they poisoned the
mind of the deceased against other rela
tives, and, again, that decedent was not
competent to make a will.
In the contest to the will, which was
filed June IS. Miss Talbot alleges that the
deceased was 75 years of age when the
alleged will was executed; that the al
leged last will and testament was not
signed by her; that she was bodily and
mentally infirm and ill. and was there
fore prevented from understanding or re
membering her affairs and daily duties,
and was weak, debilitated and deranged
to such an extent as to incapacitate her
from nicking or undertaking to make a
will.

F. P. SARGENT.
The Immigration Bureau at this port
called the attention of Frank P. Sargent,
Commissioner General of Immigration, to
this decision, and yesterday the fol
lowing note was received from Washing
ton in reply:
NOTE FROM WASHINGTON.
The Attorney General rendered an opinion
September 10. 1901. that head tax does not ap
ply to alien seamen discharged or deserting
from vessels. He states that If they shipped
with the intention in good faith of continuing
their occupation as seamen, and with no In
tention to make entry Into this country, they
are not passengers and are exempt from the
tax
Under date of June 15, 1903, ~E. T. Cham
berlain, United States Commissioner of
Navigation, wrote to United States Ship
ping Commissioner bassett at San Fran
cisco to the effect that head tax is not
collectable from seamen arriving in the
United States from foreign ports. The
letter states:
When a man ships coastwise at this port ho
has a right to return free of head tax. and if
we don't collect the tax upon his arrival from
the foreign port we cannot collect it at all.
. It is the practice on some lines to discharge
alien crew3 immediately upon the arrival of
the vessel, so as to avoid paying the wages
of the crew for one or two weeks while they
are Idle. If these sailors reship at this port
they are entitled to return. In which event we
could not collect from them.
BIGHT TO RETURN.
The law docs not specify seamen as sucrh.
but the rule of the department Is that a sea
man is a seaman until he Is dis
charged, and then he becomes an
alien immigrant. The fact that such
seamen at some subsequent time reship
and return to their own country does not es
tablish a claim for the refund of the tax so
paid. Where a sailor saya that he is going
to ship as soon as he can get a chance to sail
we have not been In the habit of reporting
him for the payment of the tax. but If he
says that he is going to remain in the coun
try, or that he Is going to ship coastwise, we
make him pay the tax.
Mr. Thomas raised the point that the
immigration law referred ; to alien im
migrants only, and that an alien seaman
uncharged from a deep-water vessel in
this port and awaiting employment wa3
not an Immigrant either in law or In fact.
Deputy United States Immigrant Com
missioner Schell was requested to point
out a paragraph in the law denning dis
charged alien reamen as Immigrants. He
replied frankly:
The. Federal courts will be called upon
to decide whether Frank P. Sargent,
Commissioner General of Immigration, ia
justified in his Interpretation of the im
migration law when he collects $2 head
tax on alien seamen discharged at thi3
port. W. Ford Thomas yesterday noti
fied Acting Customs Collector William B.
Hamilton that he refused to pay the head
tax on an alien seaman discharged at this
port from the steamship Numantla of the
Kosmos line.

WASHINGTON, July 6.-The counter
cases in the Alaskan boundary matter
have been exchanced within the tima
limit. The counter-testimony of the
United States was delivered last Friday
night to the British charge of the embas
sy at Newport, and at almost the sama
moment in London the British counter
cases were handed to the American em
bassy, so that each side la now ready for
the next step, namely, the preparation
and submission of the arguments, which
are to be laid before the commission in
London September 3.
The British Government after a careful
examination of the American case, sub
mitted two months ago, had expressed a
desire to see the originals of the many
excellent charts and maps which are tha
main reliance . of the American agents.
They include maps that never before
have been mentioned in connection with

LITTLE JJABY BOY
Badly Afflicted with Eczema.
Face Covered with Sores.
Scratched Constantly.
CURED BYCUTICURA
"My niece's little baby boy, twÂ«
years old. was so badly afflicted with
eczema that he needed constant watch-
ing. It was all over his face and he
scratched the sores constantly. Morn-
ings his clothes would be stained with
blood, and his face and hands would bo
covered. His family never conld take
him ont, as his face was always fall of
large sores. They had medical treat-
ment, and tried everything they heard
of. She commenced using the Cuticura
Remedies last spring and found that at
last she had a wonderful healer. The
sores left his face and he was entirely
cured, and now his face ls as smooth
and rosy as though no sore had ercr
been there to mar it."

"I received your note of kind In-
quiry and am pleased to Inform yon

boy. He is now a healthy child with
pink and white skin free from all
blemish. It has been a marvellous
cure and brought about In a short time
after all other medical aid failed."

mour, consisting of Cuticura Soap, to
cleanse the skin, Cuticura Ointment, to
heal the skin, and Cuticura Resolvent
Pills, to cool and cleanse the blood, may

turing, d I? figuring. Itching, burning and
