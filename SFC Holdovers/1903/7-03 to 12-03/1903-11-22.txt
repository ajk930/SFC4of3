The question asked itself many a time,
and was as often answerless, before there
camÂ© a stir without and voices In the
corridor. It was the changing of the
guard, I guessed, 1 and so It proved, since
presently I heard the'clanking of the offi

No sooner was the priest away than I

'twas clear that it had been but a poor

HOW A GOLDEN KET UNLOCKED
A DOOR.
Having my dismissal and reprieve I
was remanded to the custody of that
young Lieutenant Tybee whom you have
met and known as Falconnet's second in
the duel. Interpreting his orders liberally
he suffered me to keep my own room for
the night. I had expected manacles and
a roommate guard at the least, but my
gentlemanly Jailer spared me both. When
he had me safe abovestairs he barred
the door upon me, set a sentry pacing
back and forth In the corridor without
and another to keep an eye upon the win
dow from below, a.nd so left me.
There was no great need for either
sentry, or for bolts and bars. What with
the night's adventures and my scarce
healed wound I was far sped on that
road which ends against the blind wall
of exhaustion, | as you may well suppose.
For while a man may borrow strength
of wine or rage or passion, these lenders
are but pitiless usurers' and will demand
their pound of flesh; aye, and have it,
too, when all the principal is spent.
CHAPTER IX.
"You should not make me contradict a
lady, Mistress Margery. 'TIs evident you
have not all his confidence. He was cap
tured red-handed in the act at yonder
window, listening to {hat which he may
never know and live to prate about. Be
sides, he- killed a sentry for his chance to
listen, and for that I'd hang htm if he
were my own father's guest."
So much he said as mild- as if he had
not left his reading of the law to figure
in our annals as King George's butcher.
Then in a sudden gust of rage he turned
upon the priest, cursing him brutally and
threatening vengeance for his bringing
of the lady . to the courtroom.
My brave one stood a moment, shocked
as she had warrant for. Then, before the
priest or I or any one could: stop her, she
ran to throw herself upon her knees at
Colonel Tarleton's feetâ to kneel and plead
for me as I would gladly have died a
thousandv deaths rather than have her
plead; for life for me, or if not that, at
least for some brief respite that the priest
might shrive me.
And in the end she won the respite,
though I did think it far too dearly
bought. When he granted it the colonel
lifted her' and took. her hand, bowing low
over it with courtly deference. "For your
sake, Mistress Margery, it shall 'be put
off -till morning/'-he said; 1 then gave'the
order:. At dawn they would march, me
out" and : hang f mer and I would "best be
ready. For later than the sunrise of a
new day the king, himself might \ not .de

'-â¢You know too" much,- my cursing cap

not ; for Mistress Margery and my prom
ise, you should not keep the breath to
"Ha! How is this, Mistress Margery?
Do you keep open house for the King's
enemies? That spells treason, my dear
young lady, and hath an uglji look for
you, besides."
"It should have no look at all, save that
of hospitality, Bir," she countered brave
ly. "Surely I may plead for justice to a
wounded man who was, and is, my fath
er's guest?"
"And yet he is a spy, and spies must
hang."
"He is no spy."
The colonel's bow made but a mock of
true politeness.
m
face. And through It all, the while my
heart went near to bursting at this fresfc
proof of her most fearless loyalty, 1
ground my teeth in wrath that all those
men should look their fill and Bay by
wink and nod and covert smile that this
were somewhat more than hostess loy
alty. â¢
But it was the coloners~mocklng smile
that lashed me sharpest; his smile and
what he said; and yet not that so much
as what he left to be Inferred. Â¦ .â¢."Â¦â¢
As it chanced, this was my first, sight
near at hand of that British commander
whose name in after years the patriot
mothers spoke to fright their children.
He did not look a monster. As I recall
him now, he was a short, square-bodied
man. younger by some years than myself,
and yet with an old campigner's head well
pet jipon aggressive shoulders. His eyes
were black and ferrety; and his face, well
seasoned by the Carolina sun. was swart
as any Arab's. A man. I thought, who
could be gentle-harsh or harsh-revenge
ful, es the mood should prompt; who
could make well-turned courtier compli
ments to a lady and damn a trooper in
the self-same breath.
This was that Colonel Banaster Tarle
ton. who gave no quarter to surrendered
men; and when I looked into the sloe
black eyes I saw in them for me a waiting
gibbet.
"So!" he rapped out, when I was haled
btfore him. "You're the epjing rebel cap
tain, eh? Are you alive enough to hang?"
His lack of courtesy rasped so sorely
that I must needs give place to wrath
and answer sharply that there was email
doubt cf It, Hince I could stand and curse
him.
He scowled at that and cursed me back
again as heartily as any fishwife. Then
suddenly he changed his tune.
"They tell me you were in the service
once and left it honorably. I am loth to
hang a man who has worn the colors.
"".Vculd It please you best to die a soldier's
d^ath. Ca:>tain Ireton?"
I said it would, most surely.
He said I should have the boon if I
Â¦would tell him what an officer on the
Baron <3e Kalb's staff should know; the
strength of the Continentals, the general's
designs and dispositions, and I know not
what besidos. I think it was my laugh
that made him stop short and damn me
roundly in the midst.
"By God, I'll make you laugh another
tune!" he swore. "You rebels are all of
a piece, and clemency is wasted on you!"
"Vour mercy comes too dear; you set
too high a price upon it. Colonel Tarleton.
If. for the mere swapping of a rope for a
bullet 1 1 could be the poor caitiff your
offer implies, banging would be too good
for me." #
"U that is your last word â >-, But stay;
111 give you an hour to think It over."
"It needs not en hour nor a minute," I
replied. If I knew aught about the Con
tinental armyâ which I do notâ I'd** see
you nangvd in your own stirrup-leather
before I'd tell you, i Colonel Tarleton.
Moreover, I marvel greatly â "

mho have seen the rack applied; one is
to flack the tension on the cracking
joinie and minister cordials to the vic
tim; thÂ© other to give the straining
â¢winch a crueller twist. It was not the
gentler way my captors took, as you
â¢would guess; and when I came to know
and see and feel egain a pair of them
were kicking me alive and I was sore
and aching from their bufferings.
How Jong a time came in between my
futile dash for liberty and this harsh
preface to their dragging of me back to
the manor house I could not tell. It must
have been an hour or more, for now a
Kibbous moon hung pale above the tree
tops and all around were bivouac fires
and horses tethered to ehow that in the
interval a troop had come and camped.
The scene within the great foreroom of
the house had been shifted, too. A sen
try was pacing back and forth before the
doorâ a Hessian grenadier by the sire and
fchako of him; and when the two
trooper bailiffs thrust me in, and I had
winked and blinked my eyes accustomed
to the candlelight, I saw the table had
been swept of its bottles and glasses, and
around It, sitting as in council, were some
half-score officers of the British lighthorse
with their colonel at the head.
IN WHICH I TASTE THE QUALITY
OF MERCY.
CHAPTER VIII
It was ray plotting captain who rode
me thus to earth; and when I thrust he
laughed and swore and turned the blade
aside with his bare hand. Then, pressing
closer, he struck me with his fist, and
thereupon the night and all Its happen
ings went blank as if the blow had been
a cannon shot to crush my skull.
With all my breathless haste It was not
done too soon, nor soon enough. When I
had quickly freed a horse from the dead
hand that held it tethered and was mak
ing shift to climb into the saddle they
Thronged upon me; the captain from his
window, the others pouring hotly through
the gaping doorway.
I n-.ade- shift to get astride the horse,
to prick the poor tx-ast with the point of
sword and so to break away in some
brief dash beneath the oaks. But it was
a chase soon ended. As I remember, I
Â¦was reeling in the saddle what time the
lorezaost of them overtook me. I held
on crimly till the horse pursuing lapped
tho one I rode by head, by neck and pres
ently by withers. Then I turned and
Â¦would be making frantic-feeble passes
with the sword at the man upon his
back.
You may think small of me. If so you
must, my dears, when I confess what fol
lowed after. No man is braver than his
opportunity, and I had little stomach for
a fipht with three ungrounded men. Hence
it was narrowed now to a bold sortie for
the horses, and this I made while yet the
captain hung in air and sought his foot
hold.
Here was the chance I had prayed for.
Tom Garget's sword had clattered down
b^ide* me. and with it I sprang afoot and
cut a whizzing circle by my doughty cap
tain's ear that made him cringe and gasp
and all but tumble out upon me. The bit
of parchment fluttered down, and In a
trice I had it safe.
Â«^* s ** they were quick echoes, other
f I cradlings followed, as of chairs
I 4 flung back; and then the wladow
| Jest above me filled with crowd
"* teg figures. I marvel that I had
the wit to lie quiet as I had fallen, but I
bad: and those above, looking from a
lighted room Into the belly of the night,
6a.w nothing. Then Captain Steuart
eboBted to his dragoon horseholdei.
"Ho! Tom Garget; this way. man!" he
cried; and when he had no answer, put
a leg- across the window Â«eat to clamber
out. 'Twas in the very act. while I was
â¢watching ea'tlike every movement, that I
caw the precious scrap of parchment In his
hand.

"You put a bold front on, Captain Ire
ton, but 'tis to no purpose this time," ho
began. " 'TIs charged against you that
you rode here from the Baron's camp
with your commission in your pocket, and
came and went within our lines Ilka any
other spy. You are a soldier, sir, and you
know that's hanging. Yet I will hear you
if you've anything to cay."
I made so sure that I 'should hang In
any case that it , seemed foolish to an
swer, and so I saved my breath. Withal
he was the terror of our southland, this
tyrant colonel gave me time to consider;
and while he waited, grim and silent, tho
candles on the table guttered ;and ran
down and the dim light failed until I
could no longer Bee the face of her I loved
framed in the archway of the stair.
1 thought it hard that I had seen my
last of her sweet face thus through thick
ening shadows, as a dream might fade.
Nevertheless, I would be glad that I had
seen her thus, since otherwise, I thought,
I must have gone without this last or any
other sight of her.
It was while I was still straining my
eyes for one more glimpse of her and
while the courtroom silence deepened
dense upon us like the shadows, that Col
onel Tarleton signed to .those who guard
ed me. A hand was laid upon my shoul
der, but when I would have turned to go
with them a woman's cry cut sharp Into
the stillness. Then, before any one could
cay a word or think a thought, my daunt
less little lady stood beside me', her eyes
alight and all her glorious beauty .height
ened in a -blaze of generous emotion.
"For, shame! .Colonel... Tarletcn,".- she
cried. "Do you come thus into my fath
er's bouse and take a wounded guest and
hang him? "You say he Is a spy, but that
he cannot be, for he has lain abed' in this
same house a month or more. You shall
not hang him!"
At this "there was v a mighty stir about
the table, as you may guess; 'and some,
would smile' and some would snuff the
candles for a better sight of her sweet
While Jennifer's guard and quota were
mounting at the door the aid-de-camp re
turned, and that without the Baronet. I
caught but here and there a word of his
reportâ enough to Gather that the captain
krdght was not yet In from posting out
the sentries.
I made no doubt his absence was de
signed. He would have Margery believe
that he had spared me honorably as an
enemy wounded, and so had left me to the
tender mercies of his colonel, well assured
that Tarleton . would not spare me.' And
this the colonel did not mean to do, as I
was now to hear in brief.
Though I was full tb bursting with my
news there was nothing I could do; and
Â¦when it was fairly over and he w.as gone
I was right glad he had not seen me. For
I knew well his Bteel-true loyalty and
that at sight of me in trouble he would
have lost his slender chance of guarded
liberty, and with it my last hope of send
ing word across the mountains; though
as for that the hope was well-nigh dead
at any rate.
"What will you do with him. Captain
Lauswoulter? By the look of. him he'd
make but Indifferent sausage meat."
"Vat shall I do mit him? I shall make
him mine best bows and send him home,
py Gott! Ve did had some liddle troubles
mit der cards, and ven mine foot was
slipped on dis verdammt grease grass, he
did not run me frough so like he might."
"Oh, an affair of honor? Well, we'll
count that in his favor. Take him away,
Trelawny, and quarter yourself and twen
ty men upon him at Jennifer House. You
have your parole, Mr. Jennifer, but, by
the Lord, if you break It by so much as
a wink or a nod Trelawny will hang you
to your own ridge pole."
Given a hearing, Jennifer would have
spoiled it all by swearing hotly he had
given no parole, but at the word the
colonel roared him down like a bull of
Bashan. and In the hubbub my brave lad
was hustled out.
Luckily, he did not single me out among
the bystanders, being fresh come from
the night without to the glare of candle
light within, and while the swart-faced
colonel plied him with questions I had a
chance to lok him up and down. Though
his arm was still in its sling, he was
seemingly the better of his wound. There
was a glow of health and strength return
ing in cheek and eye, and I thought him
handsomer than ever what time he stood
forth boldly and fronted down the bully
ing colonel.
Knowing the Jennifer stock and its fine
scorn of subterfuge, I feared It would go
hard with Richard, and so, indeed, it had
gone, lacking a word in season from an
enemy. When Tarleton would have made
him choose between the taking i of the
King's oath and captivity in the hulks at
Charleston, a burly Hessian captain at
the table spoke the word in season.
"Verdammt! mine colonel; I vill know
dis Mr. Ycnifer. He is a prave young
echalawag-s, and he is not gone out mlt
der rebels. Give him to me for mine
plunders."
The colonel laughed and showed his
teeth. Having one man to hang, he could
afford to be lenient with another.
While I was watching her, and we were
waiting yet upon the aid de camp's re
turn, there was a stir without, and when
it reached the door the sentry challenged.
Some confab followed, and I overheard
enough to tell me that a scouting party
had come in, bringing a prisoner. The
colonel bade me Btand aside, and passed
the word to fetch the prisoner before him.
When the thing waÂ« done I Bet my teeth
upon a groan. For it was Richard Jen
nifer.
As I have said, this gathering room of
our old house was in size like an ancient
banquet hall. It had a gable to itself In
breadth and height, and at the farther
end there was a flight of some few steps
to reach the older portion of the house
beyond. The upper end of this low stair
pierced the thick wall of the older house,
and in the shadows of the niche thus
formed I saw my lady Margery.
She was standing as one who looks and
listens; and my rage fit blazed out upon
the descrying of a shadowy figure of a
man behind her; a man I guessed in jeal
ous wrath to be the Baronetâ a reasonless
suspicion, since the volunteer captain
would certainly have made his presence
known when his colonel had called him.
But while my heart was yet afire my
lady moved aside as if to have a better
sight of us below, and then I saw It was
the priest behind her.
"At your informant's lack of Invention.
He might have brought me straight from
General Washington's haedquarters while
he was about it. 'Twould be no greater
Up than that he told you."
He heard me through, then fell to curs-'
ing me afresh, and would be sending an
aid de camp hotfoot for Falconnet.
While the messenger was going and
coming there was a chance for me to
look around like a poor trapped animal in
a pitfall, loath to die without a struggle,
yet seeing not how any less inglorious end
should offer. The eye ' search went for
little of encouragement; there was no
chance either to light or fly. But apart
from this, the probing of the shadows re
vealed a thing that set me suddenly in a
fever, first of rage, and then of apprehen
sion.
"At what?" he cut in rudely.
As more than once before In this event
ful night, the air went flaming red before
my eyes and helpless wrath came upper
most. I saw no way to clear her. and had
there been the plainest way. dumb rags
Â¦would still have held me tonguetled. So
I could only mop and mow and stammer
and. when. the words were found, maka
shift to blunder cut that such an accusa
tion did the lady grievous wrong; t8*t
she had come attended and at my be
seeching, to take a message from a dy
ing man to one who' was his

"You've found a way to make me speak,
sir. and I wish you Joy of it. 'Twas I
who bribed your sensry, and I did it to
go to Captain Ireton's room."
The colonel laughed . and shot a sharp
gibe at my enemy. '
"How Is this. Sir Francis? Did I. not
tell you you had thrust an Inch or so too
high? By God. sir, I think you will coma
overlate. if ever you do come at alL This

Now I have said that she was changeful

woman tremulous and tearful aa any
woman caught In a desperate deed; the
next she became a go<ides3 vilified, and if
her look had been a dagger I think, her
flashing eyes had killed him where ha
stood.
"By God, you He!" was hfs comment on
this. "She might have tampered with tha
guard and so got leave to keep a midoisrht
tryst with you. but not you ' And then
to my poor frightened love: "Have you
no shame. Mistress Margery Stair?"
"That is none of your affair. Colonel
Tarleton," I retorted boldly, thinking
that with such a man the shortest word
were ever the best. "Yet I may say that
the lady knew not what she did. nor whu.

" Twas a dastard's trick, my captainâ
this tangling of a lady in your treason."
he begsn. "How did you get your speech
with her?"
The colonel stood apart, the center of a
group of officers, and Falconnet was with
him. Hovering on the edges of the group,
as if afraid to show themselves too bold
ly In such a coil.' were Gilbert Stair and
that smooth parchment- visa ged knave,
his factor. The while they thrust mÂ»
forth to take my place at Margery's side
the good old priest come and would have
Joined us; but they would not suffer him.
So we two stood alono togethsr as
we had stood before; but now my
lady's eyes were downcast, and her
lips and cheeks .were pale. Yet
she was more . beautiful than Z
had ever seen herâ so beautiful
that I would swear the sum of all thÂ«
precious gifts in God's great universe
might be expressed for me in this; that I
might die to save her from this shame
and agony.
When my guards had thrust mÂ«. for
ward the colonel made short work of our
fresh offense. T<J Â¦
They bound me well and strongly with
many wrappings of stout cord before they
led me down. Nor must you . think me
broken-spirited because I let them. In
any other cause but this I hope' I should
have fought to die unmanacled; but now
I suffered gladly this little, seeing Z tuA.
made my dear lady suiter so greatly. -^
When we were coma Into the room be
low they let me stand beside her. as I
had prayed God they tnight, and when I
stole a glance at her I was fain to think
my coming gave her courage and support.

torches, and they had never offered her a
chair. '. .
Yours is a skeptic age, my < dears, and
you have learned . to scoff at 'things you

was answered. Whila yet the anguish of
it wrung my soul ; there came a hasty
trampling in the corridor, the. gentry's
challenge and then; a quick unbarring of
the door. I turned .upon my heel to face
a young ensign come with two men at
his back to take me to tho colonel.
Anon the windows of the great fore
room flung bands of yellow torchlight out
upon the lawn, and I knew that Tarle
ton's court was set again. At that the
pains of hell got hold upon me and I did
pray as I had never prayed before that
God would grant me this one boonâ to
stand beside her in this time of trial; to
give me tongue of eloquence to tell them
all that she was innocent; to' give me
breath to swear she knew, not why she
went, or what the message* was. she car

trustâ she knew it well when she had
promised me â she had taken the errand
upon herself, bravins a hazard that would
have daunted many a. man.
I thought the worst had surely now be

I had died before it came to this. But
there was worse in store. ] Her captors

to flog the rabble into order; then she
was taken from her horse and led into
the house. Â»

these. I watched and listened 'while' the
measured minutes, circling: slow on lead

and despair, cold Ilk* a winter fog, had
chilled me to the bone. For now It canvj^

had been careful so ' to word thÂ» letter
as to shield my correspondentâ both Mar
gery and Dick would be Involved.
'Tis worthy of remark â¢ how, building
on the simplest supposition, we seldom
prophesy aright. For all my fine-spun
theories the manner, of the thing that
happened was all unlike the forecast.
Suddenly, and in silence, out of the ghoÂ«t
ly shadows of the trees and into the wan
moonlight of the open space- beneath my
window, with neither shout nor crash of
sentry gun to give 'warning, cam*
threo figures riding abreastâ Â«. man la
trooper trappings on either band and on
the led horso sandwiched In between, Â¦>
woman.
Â¦was made up of veterans, schooled well
in border warfare, and though the biv
ouac seemed but a camp of motionless
figures fast manacled in sleepâ I could
see them strewn like dead men round thÂ»
smoldering firesâ I made no doubt the
sentries were alert and wakeful. How,
then, was auy messenger of Margery's to
pass the lines, or, passing them, to com*
at Jennifer, who by this time would bÂ« at
Jennifer House, a prisoner in all but
name?
And but for this, that I heard the door
latch click behind her, and then the
heavy wooden bar fall into, place, I might
have thought the happenings of the hour
the unsubstantial fancies of a dream.
The low impassioned chant of the Ro
man litany was ringing in my ears as I
sat down to the table to write my mes
sage to Richard Jennifer. There were
quills and . an ink-pot at hand, but no
paper. I felt mechanically In my pocket
and found, not some old letter, as I hoped,
but the crumpled parchment map
snatched and hidden when Captain Stuart
had winced and dropped it at the bidding
of the whistling sword about his. ears.
How it was they had not searched me
for it, I know not; though haply the cap
tain did not guess how he had lost it. Be
that as it might, I had It safe, and Dick
should have it safe, and use it, too, to
some good purpose, as I fondly hoped.
You'd hardly ' think from the slow and
clumsy spinning 'of this tale that I could
crowd the narrative of all that I had seen
and heard into a niggard three-score
words or less. But this I did, writing
them upon the margin of the captain's
map, and noting in an added line the
pricking out of the powder convoy's
route. And while my pen was looping on
the flourish to my name, my eager little
lady seized the pounce-box, handed me
the heavy tralllngs of the quill, snatched
and hid the parchment in her bosom and
was cone.
"He is a prisoner, and if he were not
they would not let him see me. Besides, I
would not let you go on such an errand.
And yetâ God help me, Margery! there Is
many an innocent life hanging on this;
the lives of helpless women and children.
Have you ever a messenger to send, a
man who will risk his life and can be
trusted fully?"
"Yes. yes!" she cried. "Write it down
for me and Dick shall have it. Quick;
for Our Lady's sake, be quick about itl
O Sancta Maria, mater Deiâ"
"You could have done much less, dear
lady," I said, taking her hands In mine;
"much less, and still be blameless. You
have done too much for me already. I
would you had not done so much, I would
to God I had been hanged before you went
upon your knees to thatâ"
She freed one hand and laid a finger on
my lipâ nay, It was her palm, and If I
took a dyinÂ«r man's fair leave and kissed
It softly, I think she knew it not.
"Huahl" she commanded. "Is this a
time to harbor bitter thoughts T I thought
you might have other things to say to meÂ»
Monsieur John."
"There is no other thing that I may
Â¦ay."
j "Not anything at alI7"
"Naught but a parting hope for you. I
hope you will be true and loyal to your
self, Margery mia." .
"To myself? I do not understand.
"I think you doâ I think; you must.
"But I do not."
I turned it over more than once in my
mind if I should tell her all I had feared;
should tell her how I came to kill a man
and was fair set to kill another. had I
found a wedding afoot in the great fore
room. I could not bring myself to do it,
and yet I thought it would go hard with
me If I should leave her still unwarned.
"If I should try to make you under
stand you will be angry, as you were be-
The wicker chair was dose beside the
table and she sat down. And when she
Â¦poke she had her hands tight-clasped
across her knee and would not look at me.
"In nâ aboutâ Sir Francis?"
"It is," said I, pausing once more upon
the brink of full confession.
She waited patiently for me to speak
further; waited and let me fight it out m
Blow -pacings up and down before her
chair. .
I think my lady must have known how
hard It was for me to speak, for, when
the silence had grown overlong. she said
genuy: "I bought these Hying minutes of
the sentry. Monsieur John. Will you not
use them?" " _ .... .
"If I should say the thing I ought to
say, you'll think the minutes dearly
bought, I fear."
"No, that I shall not, if it will ease you
mind."
"Then tell me why you sent for Father
Matthleu."
The light was dim, as I have said, yet
I could see the faint flush spread from
neck to cheek.
"You are not of the church, Monsieur
John. You would not understand if I
should tell you."
"I think I understand without your tell
.ing. You. said Sir Francis Falconnet had
asked for you." : >
" 'Twas you who drove me to say it.
' "Because I tried. to warn you?"
'"Because you would be vengeful when
you should have been forgiving."
"'Twas not revenge, just- then, though
while I live I shall, have ample cause to
hate this man." .
"What was it, then?"
"It was love; love for you, andâ and
Richard Jennifer."
She rose, and I could see her eyes ashlne
for all the half-gloom of the candle
light.
"You are a loyal friend!" she said, and
there was that within the words to make
me glad, whatever fate the dawn should
have in store for me. "You always think
of others first; you think of others- now,
whenâ when deathâ Oh. Monsieur John!
what can I do for you? Say quick! The
man is coming to the door!"
"Now I have told you this, there Is but
one other thing, Margery dear; one little
thing that will not let me die in peace.
If I might have ten words with Richard
Jennifer "
She left me in a fever flutter of excite
ment, whipped to the door, and had a
word with him who stood without. I
heard the chink of coin, and then she
hastened back to me, all eagerness and
tremulous Impatience.
"Tell me â tell me instantly what I must
do. I am not afraid. Shall I ride down
to Jennifer House and fetch Dick here?"
time*â as , nowâ so soft and gentle. And
though I thought It cruel that I should
have to fight my battle for thÂ© loslns of
her over again, I had not the heart to
chide her.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
THE MASTER OF APPLEBY
2THE SUNDAY CALL. I
colonel, went the rounds In Jeering grins
cf Incredulity. And on the heels of It the
colonel rwore afresh, cursing me for a
clumsy liar.
"A likely etory. that!" he scoSed. "Next
you will say she knew not what this mes-
Baze was."
"I said it once. Eh* knew not what the
message was. nor why I sent It/*
I felt her eyes upon me as I spoke and
turned to find them full of tearful plead
ing. "Oh. tell tlÂ»e truth !" she whispered.
"Don't you see? He has the letter!"
I looked, and sure enough he held it In
his hand; and then I understood the flash
of irony In the sloe-black eyes of him.
"Tou lie clumsily. Captain Ireton,
though it Is a gentlemanly lie and does
you honor. But we have trapped you
fairly, and you may as well make a clean
breast of it. Your mistress knew very
well what you would have her do, and
Â¦inee she is your mistress, went to do lt_"
Â¦While he was speaking I had a thought
white hot from some forge fire of Inspira
tion â a thought to tip an arrow of convic
tion and set it quivering in the mark. I
would not stop to measure It; to look
aside at her or any other lest one brief
g!ascÂ« apart should send the arrow wa
vering from Its course. So I looked the
colonel boldly In the eye and drew the bow
and spÂ«d tha shaft.
"You think no other than a mistress
Â¦would have done this. Colonel Tarletonâ
that it was done for love? Well, so It
was; but . with thÂ« love there went a
duty.**
"A duty. Â«ay you? How la that?"
I bowed as best I might, being so
tightly bound; then fixed his eye again.
"Tou had forgot that honor is not
wholly dead. sir. This laÂ£y la my wife."
CHAPTER XL
HOW A T-TT* WAS MAX)E THE VERT
TRUTH.
For souks small instant I dared not looÂ»e
my eye-grip on the colonel, to glance aside
at Falconnet. or Gilbert S-tair. or at thÂ«
woman close beside me. If I tad flinched
cr wavered, or let an eyelid droop but by
the thickness of a hair, this keen-eyed
colonel would have beÂ«n upon me to cut
the ground beneath my feet and leave me
dangling by the lie-
But u 1: was I facÂ«d Mm down; and.
winning him. won alL There was a mut
tered oath from Falconnet, a tremulous
cry of rage from where h-r father stood:
and then I sought my lady's eyes to read
my sentence In them.
She gave me but a glance, and^hough
I tried as I had never tried beforeTo read
her meaning it was hid from me. But
this I marked: that she did draw aside
from me, and that her face was cold and
etill. and that her lips were pressed to
gether as If not all nor any should ever
make her speak again.
At this sharp crisis, when a look
or word would cost me more than death
and rny dear lady her honor, it was
the colonel who, all unwittingly.
stood ray friend. A breath of doubt upon
mv VÂ« and we were lost: and once I
thocsjbt he would have breathed it. But
be did not. Instead, he broke out In a
laugh, with a gibe floss first at Gilbert
Stair and then at Falconnet.
â¢God save us! I pive you Joy. Mr.
Stair, ar.d you. Sir Francis. These two
have duped you bravely. By heavens!
Sir Frank; 'twas you who should have
had the sword thrust in the duel. In that
event you might have stoad ia Captain
Iretcns shoes, and so had the priest
fetched for your beneflt." Then he turn
ed to Margery- wiih a bow that had no
touch of mockery In It. "I crave your
psrdcn, madame; I knew not you were
pleading for your husband's life an hour
ago. It grieves me that I may not spare
btxa to you longer than the night, but
v ar is cruel at its best-"
She stood like any statue done In cold
Carrara while he spoke; and when she
n:ade no sign he gave the word to re
..'rrrr.it me.
"Take him away. Lieutenant Tybee, and
fee he has a bribe-proof man this time to
keep him company. Madame Ireton, I'll
put vou en your honor: you may have
access to him* but there must be no mes-
Fages carried out. To your quarters, gen
tlemen. We must ride far and hard to
rn Trow."
When his final word had set her free
my frozen maiden came to life and ran
to throw herself In helpless sobbings, not
upen her father, as you would think, but
upon the good priest. And It was Father
Matthieu who led her, stlil crying softly.
out of the throng and up thÂ© low stair;
ar.d now I marked that oil the rough sol
diery stood aside and made way for her
with never a man among them to scoff
cr sneer or poir.t a gibe.
At her going Tybee drew his sword and
cut the cord that bound me.
"Theee youngling cubs are overcautious.
Captain Ireton. We shall not make It
harder for each other than we must." he
said with bluff good nature. And then:
"Will you lead the way to your room.
Birr* this to give the youngling cub an
cther lesson. I suppose.
I walked beside him to the stair and
when. I etumbled, being weak and spent.
he took my arm and steadied me and did
I tÂ»*'"fc It kindly done. At my own door
he gave me precedence again, saying,
with a touch cf the grateful Old World
courtesy. "After you, eir," and standing
aside to let me enter first. When we
were both within ha touched upon the
colonel's mandate.
"I must obey orders. Captain Ireton.
but by your good leave I shall not lock
you up with any trooper; I'll stay with
yciu myself."
I thought this still niore kindly than
aught he had dona before, and so I told
bim. But be put It off lightly.
" *Tls little enough an> one can do for
you. my friend,, but I will do that little as
I can. You are like to have a visitor. I
take It; If you have, I'm sure 'twill be a
comfort If your bodyguard can be stone
blind and deaf."
So Baying, he dragged the big wicker
chair Into tha bay window, planted him
self deep within It with his back to all
tha room, and so left me to my own de
vices.
Being spent enough to sleep beneath
tha shadow of a gibbet. I threw myself
full length upon the bed and was, I think,
adrift uaon the ebb tide of exhaustion
and fcrsetfulness when once asaln the
shifting of the wooden door bar roused
nie. I rose up quickly, but Tybee was
before roe. There was some low voiced
conference at the door; then Tybee came
to me,
- Tls Mr. Gilbert Stair," he said. "He
has permission from the colonel and In
sists that be must see you solus. I'll
take your word and leave you, .If you
like."
At first I bung reluctant, wanting little
of the host who came so late *o sea his
truest. Then, as If a sudden flash of
lightning hart irvea'ed it. I realized, as
I had not before, how I had set the feet
cf my dear lady In a most hideous laby
rinth of deception: how this lie that I
had told to bridge a momentary gap must
leave her neither maid nor widow in the
morning.
**YeÂ», tcm: tor God's sake, let him In,
Mr. Tyb*â¬." I burst out. "I am fair
rraxed with w*artnes*. and had forgot.
*TU soft Important, I do assure you."
\ .- - thing was done at once, and be-
fore T knew it I was alone with the old '
man who, though he was my supplanter.
was also Margery's father. He entered
cautiously, shielding his bedroom candle
with his hand and peering over it to
make me. out, as If venturing in were
not unperilous. And I marked that when
he rut the candle down upon the table
he edped away and felt behind him for
the >lonr as if to make sure of his re
treat in case of need.
"Sit down. Captain Ireton: sit down, I
beg of you," he said in his thin, rasping
treble. And when I had obeyed: "I think
you must know what I've come for, Cap
tain Ireton?"
I raid I could guess; and he began again,
volubly now. as if to have it over In the
shortest space.
" 'Twas not n gentlemanly thing for you
to do. Captain Iretonâ this marrying of
a foolish girl out of hand while you wcr*
here, a cuest: and as for the priest that
did it Iâ I'll have him hanged before the
army leaves, I promise you. But now 'tis
done I hope ye're prepared to make the
best 'of It?"
I saw at once that his daughter had
rot yet confided m him; that he was still
enta.npled In my He. So I thought it well
to probe him deeper while I might.
"What would you call *thÂ« best,* If I
may ask?" said I, growing the cooler with
some better seeing of the way ahead.
"The marriage settlements!" he cried
shrilly, coming to the point at once, as
once, as any miser would. "It's the
merest matter of form, as ye may say.
for your title to Appleby Hundred is
well burnt out. I promise you. But for
the decent look of it you might make
over your quitclaim to your wife."
"Aye, truly; so I might."
"And so you should, sir; that you
should. j*<* miserable, spying runag" â he
choked and coughed behind his hand and
then began again without the epithets.
" 'Tls the very least ye can do for her
now. when you have the rope fair around
your cur's â ahem â your â your rebel
neck. Only for the form's sake, to be
sure, ye understand, for she'd Inherit
after you In any case."
I saw his drift at last, and, not caring
to epare him. sped the shaft of truth
and let It find the Joint in his harness.
"'Tls.as you say, Mr. Stair. But as It
chances. Mistress Margery is not my
wife,"
it I had flung the candle at him where
he stood fumbling behind him for the
door-latch, 'twould not have made him
shrink or dodge the more.
"Wha â what's that ye say?" he piped
In shrillest cadence. "Not married?
Then you â you â "
"I lied to save her honor â that was
all' A wife might do the thing she did
and go scot free of any scandal; but not
a maid, as you could' see and hear."
For some brief time It smote him
speechless, and in the depth of his
foolish fear of me he fell to pacing up
and down, though always with the table
cannlly between us. And as he shuffled
back and forth the thin lips muttered
foolish nothings, with here and there a
tremulous oath. When all was done he
dropped into a chair and stared across
at me with leaden eyes: and truly he
had the look of one struck with a mortal
sickness.
*"I think â I think you owe me some
thing now beyond your keeping. Captain
Ireton." he quavered, at length, mumbling
the words as do the palsied. â¢ Â¦
'"Since you are Margery's father, I ova -
you anything a dying man can pay,"
said I. .""" â :"'
"Words; empty words," he fumed. "If
it were a thing to do. nowâ"
"You need but name the thing and I
will do It willingly."
Instead of naming It he shot a ques
tion at me. driving it home with certain
random thrustings of the shifty eyes.
"Who Is your next of kin. Captain Ire
ton r*
"Septimus, of the same name, master
of Ireton. on the James River, and a
major In the Virginia line." I answered,
wondering how my cousin once removed
should figure in the present coiL But
Gilbert Stair's next question dispelled
the mystery.
"If you should die Intestate, this Sep
timus would be your heir?"
"As next of kin. I should suppose he
would. But I have nothing to devise."
"Tr*Â»e: and yet" â he paused again as
if the wording of It were not easy. -
"Be free to speak your mind, Mr.
Stair." said I.
" 'Tls this," he cried, gathering him-
Belf as with an effort. "You've claimed
my daughter as your wife before them
all, and when you die to-morrow morn
ing vou'll leave her her neither wife nor
maid. I thinkâ I think you'd best make*
that lie of yours the truth."
If one of his thin hands that clutched
the chair arms had pressed a secret
and closed a traD to send me gaspi'ig
dowu an oubliette I should have been the
less astounded. Indeed, for some short
epace I thoiicht him mad; yet, on sec
ond thought, 1 saw the method in his
madness. Could Margery be brought to
view It calmly this was a sword to cut
the knot of all entanglements.
As matters stood the .world would call
her widow at my death: and since a
woman iÂ« first of all the keeper of her
own rood name she would . never dare
aver the truth. So In common Justice
she should own the name the world would
call her bv. Again, as matters stood, no
wrong could come of It to her, or Rich
ard Jennifer, or any. Dick would love
her r.cna the less because a dying man '
had given her hi* name for some few
hours. And If. at any future time, the
Ireton title should revive and this poor
double dealing miser should be forced to
quit his hold on Appleby Hundred my
father's acres would be hers In her own
right. One breach in all this sudden
builded wati I saw. but could not mend
It. With the Ireton acres hers by double
rifrht. the Baronet would press bis suit
with greater vigor than before. But as
to thi* no further act of mine could help
or Â¦hirder: and If I died her husband she
would In decency delay a while.
SoÂ« surr.mlnjc up in far less time than
tt cost to write It out for you I gave my
host hi? answer.
*'I told you you might name the deed
and I would do it. Mr. Stair.. If you
car. makÂ« vour daughter understand"â
"The Jac> will do as she is bid," he cut
In wrathfu!!y. "If she will drag my good
name In the mire, I'm damned If she
sha'n't pay the scot. And now about the
settlements. Captain Ireton: you'll be
making her legatee residuary?"
At this I saw his drift ajraln, most
clearly; that he would never stickle for
his daughter's honor, but for the qulet
icg of hlÂ« title to my father's landsâ a
title that my cousin Septimus might dis
pute. It was enough to met me obstinate
against him: but I constrained mvse'.f to
think of Margery and Richard Jennifer,
and not at all of this poor petty miser.
Til sirn a quitclaim In her favor. If
that Is what yen mean." I paid. "But
'tis a mere pen scratch for the lawyers
to haggle ovr. As you *a'd a while ago,
the wife will b* the husband's heir at
law In any event."
"Trre: bet we'd b~st be at It in due
and proper form." He rose and hobbled'
to the door and was so set upon haste
that h!s ' shaking hand played a j rattling
tattoo on the latch. "Iâ I'll go and have
the papers drawn, and you will sign them.
Captain Ireton: I have your passed word
that, you will sign them."
. "Aye; they shall be signed. "-
He went away at that, and Tybee en
tered. Much to my comfort, the lieuten
ant asked no questions: so far from It,
he crossed the room wlwiout a word,
flung himself -into the great 1 chair and
left me to ray own communings.
These were not altogether of assurance.
Though I had promised readily .enough
to make my lie a truth, I saw that all
was yet contingent upon my lady's view-
Ing of the proposal. That I could win
her over I had some hope. If- only they
would leave the taik for. me. But there
was room to fear that this poor miser
father would make It all a thing of prop
erty and so provoke her to resistance.
3V.nd. notwithstanding what he saidâ that
she wou'd do as she was bidâ I thought
I knew her temper well enough to proph
esy a hitch. For I made sure of on3 thing.
that If she put her will against the world
the world would never move her.
â¢Twas past midjiight. with Tybee dozing
in his chair, when next I heard some stir
rings In the corridor. /As before. It was
the lifting of the wooden bar that roused
my friendly guard, and when he went to
parley at the door I stood apart and
turned my back.
When I looked again my company was
come. A{ the table, busied with a parch
ment that might have been a ducal title
deed for felze. stood Gilbert Stair and
the factor lawyer. Owen Pengarvln. A
little back of them, the good old Father
Matthleu had Margery on his arm. And
In the corner Tybee stood to keep the
door.
I grouped them all In one swift eye
sweep, and, having listed them, strove
to read some lessoning of my part In my
dear lady's face. ' She gave me nothing
of encouragement, nor yet a cue of any
kind trÂ» lead to what it was that she
would have me say or do. ,As I had seen
It last, under the light of the flaring
torches in the room below, her face was
cold and still; and she was standing mo
tionless beside the priest, looking straight
at me. it seemed, with eyes that saw
nothing. - ' , ,
It was the factor .lawyer who broke the
Â¦Hence, saying, with . his predetermined
smirk, that the parchment was ready for
my signature. Thlnklns: It well beneath
me to measure words with* this knavish
pettifogger. I looked beyond him and
spoke to his master.
"I would have a word or two In pri
vate with your daughter before this mat
ter ripens further, Mr. Stair," I said.
My lady dropped the priest's arm and
came to stand beside me In the window
bay. I offered her a chair, but she re
fused to sit. There was so little time to
spare that I must needs begin without
preliminary.
"What has your father told you, Mar
gery?" I asked. .
"He tells me nothing that I care to
know."
- "But he has told you what you must
dor*
"Tes." She looked wlth^eyes that saw
me not.
"And you are here to do It of your own
freewill?"
"No." ... _
"Tet it must be done.**
"So he says, and so you say. But I
had rather die." ,'.Â¦, . .'
"*Tls not a pleasing thing. I grant you,
Margery; notwithstanding, Â¦ of our^ two
evils It is by far the less. Bethink you a'
moment: 'tis but the saying of a few
word's by the priest, and the bearing of
my name for some short while till you
can change it for a better."
Her deep- welled eyes met mine, and In
them was a flash of anger. , â¢
"Is that what marriage means to you.
Captain Ireton?"
"No, truly. . But we have no choice.
â¢Tls this, or I must leave you In the
morning to worse things than the bear-
Ing of my name. I would It had not
thus been thrust upon us, but I could see
no other way.". _ -
"See what comes of tampering with
the truth." she said, and I could see her
short lip curl with scorn. "Why should
you lie and lie again, when any one could
see ' that it must come to this â or
worse?"
"I saw it not," I said. "But had I
stopped to â¢ look beyond the momerrt'/i
need and seen the end from the begin
ning, I fear I should have lied yet other
times. Tour honor was at stake, dear
lady."
"My honor!**â this in bitterest Irony.
"What Is a woman's honor, sir, when you
or any man has patched and sewed and
sought to make It whole again? I will
not say the word you'd have me say!"
"But you must say it. Margery. 'Tls
but the merest form; you forget that
you will be a wife only in name. I shall
not live to make you rue It."
"You make me rue It now, beforehand.
Mon Dleu! Is a woman but a thing, to
stand before the priest and plight her
troth for 'merest form'? You'll make me
hate you while I live â and after!"
"You'd hate me worse, Margery dear.
If I should leave you drowning In this
ditch. And I can bear your hatred for
some few hours, knowing that if I sin
ned and robbed you. I did make restitu
tion as I could."
She heard me through with eyelids
down and some fierce storm of passion
shaking â¢ her. And when she answered
her voice was low and soft; yet It cut
me like a knife.
"You drive me to It â Usten. sir. you
drive me to ltl And I have said that I
shall hate you for it. Come; 'tis but a
mockery, as you say; and they are wait
ing."
I sought to take her hand and lead
her forth, but this she would not suffer.
She walked beside me, proud and cold
and scornful; stood beside me while I
Â¦at j and read the parchment over. It
was no marriage settlement; It was" a
will, drawn out in legal form. And In
it I bequeathed to Margery Ireton as her
truo Jointure, not any claim of mine to
Appleby Hundred, but the estate it
self.
I read It through as I have said, and,
looking across to these two plotters, the
miser-master and his, henchman, smiled
as I had never thought to smile again. .
"So." said I, "the truth is out at last.
I wondered if the confiscation act had
left you wholly scatheless, Mr. Stair.
Well. I am content. I shall die the
easier for knowing that I have lain a
guest in my own house. Give me the
pen."
'Twas given quickly, and I signed the
will, with TybÂ«e and the. lawyer for the
witnesses; Margery standing by the
while and looking on: though not. I made
sure, with any realizing of the business
matter.
When all was done the priest found
his book, and we stood before him; the
woman who had sworn to hate, and the
man who. loving, her to full forgetful-
ness of death Itself, must yet be cold
and formal. -masking 'his love for her
dear sake, and for the sake of loyalty to
his friend. And here again 'twas Tybee
and the lawyer who were the witnesses;
the one well hated, and the other loved
lf N but for this; that when the time came
for the giving of the ring, he drew a
gold band from his little finger and made
me take and use it. â
And so that deed was done In some
such sorry fashion as the time and place
constrained: and had you stood within,
the four walla of that upper room you
would have thoaght the chill of death
had touched us. and that the low-voiced
priest was shriving us the while we
knelt to take the benediction. All
through this farce â which was. In truth
the grimmest of all tragedies â my lady
played her part as one who walks In
sleep; and at the end she let her father
lead her out with not a word or look or
sign to me.
Tou'd guess that I would take it hard
â her leaving me thus, as I made sure,
for all eternity: and I did take It hard.
For when the strain was off. and there
was no one by to see or hear save my
good-hearted death-watch, I must needs
go down upon my knees beside the bed
In childish weakness and sob and choke
and, let the hot tears come as I had not
since at this same bedside I had knelt a
little lad to take my mother's dying love.
CHATER XIL
HOW THE NEWS CAME TO UNWEL
COME EARS.
Though all the western quarter of the
sky was night-black and spangled yet
with stars, the dawn was graying slow
ly In the east when Tybee roused me.
"They have not come for you as yet."
he said, "so I took time by the forelock
and passed the word for breakfast. It
heartens a man to eat a bite and drink
a cup of wine Just on the battle's edge.
Will you sit and let me serve you. Cap
tain Ireton?"
"That I will not." said I.- adding that
I would blithely share the breakfast
with him. Whereat he laughed and dipt
my hand and swore I was a true soldier
and a brave gentleman^ to boot.
So we sat and hobnobbed at the table,
and Tybee lighted all the remnant candle
ends and broached the wine and pledged
me In a bumper before we fell to upon
the cold haunch of venison.
My summons came when we had
shared the heel-tap of the bottle. It
was my toast to this kind-hearted young
ster, and we drained It. standing what
time the stair gave back the tread of.
marching men. Tybee crashed his glass
upon the floor and wrung my hand across
the table. *
"Good-by, my captain; they have come.
God damn me. sir. I'll swear they might
do worse than let you go. for all your
spying. Tou've carried off this matter
with the lady as a gentleman should, and
whilst I live she shall not lack a friend.
If you have any word to leave for
herâ"
I shook my head. "No." said I: then
on second thought: "And yet there Is a
word. You saw how I must see the
matter through to shield the lady?"
"Surely; 'twas plain enough for any
one to see."
"Then I shall die the easier If you
will undertake to make It plain to Rich
ard Jennifer. He must be made to know
that I supplanted him only In a formal
way. and that to save the lady's -honor."
The lieutenant promised heartily, and
as he spoke the oaken bar was lifted and
my reprieve was at an end.
Having the thing to dispatch before
they broke their fast, my soldier hang- #
men marched me off without ado. The*
house and all within It seemed yet
asleep, but out of doors the legion van
guard was astir, and newly kindled
rampflres smoked and blazed among the
trees. In shortest space we left these
signs of life behind, and I began to
think toward the end.
'Tls curtous how sweet this troubled
life of ours becomes when that day
wakes wherein It must be shuffled off! As
a soldier must, I thought I had held life
lightly enough; nay.tlils I know, I had
often worn It upon my sleeve In battle.
Rut now. when I was marching forth to
this cold-blooded end wltnout the battle
chance to make It ' welcome, all nature
cried aloud to me.
a mile beyond the outfields of Appleby
Hundred we passed the legion picket line,
and I besran to wonder why we went ao^
far; wondered and made bold to ask the'
ensign In command, turning It Into grim
Jest and pavinc I mlsllkeu to come too
weary . to my end.
The ensign, a curst young popinjay, as
little officer cubs are like to be, answered
flippantly that the colonel had commuted
my sentence; that I was to be shot like
a eold ; er, and that far enough afield so
the volleying would not wake the house.
So we fared on, and a hundred yards
beyond this point' of question and reply
came out Into an ooen jrrove of oaks;
then I knew where they had brought me
âand why. 'Twas the glade where I had
fought my losing battle with the Baronet.
On It* farther confines two horses nib
bled rein's length at the grass, with Fal
connet's trooper serving man to. hold
them: and, standing on the very spot
where he had thrust me out, my enemy
was waiting.
'Twas all prearranged: ' for when tha
ens'gn had saluted he marched his men
a little way apart and drew them up In
line with muskets ported. But at a slfrn
from Falronnet two of the men broke
ranks and came to strap me helpless with
their belts. I smiled at. that, and would
not miss the chance to Jeer. ..
"Totr are a sorry coward. Captain Fal
connet. as bullies ever are," I said.
''Would "hot your sword suffice against a
man with empty hands?"
He passed the taunt In silence and,
when the men had left me, said: "I have
come to speed your partlng^Captaln Ire
ton. Tou are a thick heided. witless fool.
as you have always been: yet since you've
blundered into cervine me I would not
grudge the t'me to come and thank you."
"I serve you?" I cried. "God knows
I'd serve you up In collops at the table
of your master, the devil, could I but
stand before you with a carving tool!"
He lauffhed softly. "Alwaya . vengeful
and vindictive, and always because you
must ever mess and meddle with other
men's concerns," he retorted. "And yet
I say you've served me."
"Tell me how. In God's name, that I
may not die with that sin unrepented
of." .,
"Oh. In many small ways, but chiefly
in this affair with the little lady of Ap
pleby."
"Never!" I denied. "So far as decent
speech could compass It. I have ever
sought to tell her what a conscienceless
villain you are."
He laughed again. at that.'
"Tou' know women but Indifferently,
my captain. If you think to breach n love"
affair by a cannonade of hard words. But
I am in no humor to dispute with you.
Tou have lost, and' I have won; and.
were I not here to coma between, you'd
look your last upon the things of earth
In shortest order. I do assure you."
"You? â you come between?" I scoffed.
"Tou are all kinds of a knave. Sir Fran
cis, but your worst enemy never accused
you of being a fool!**
There was a look In hia eyes that I
could never fathom.
"You are bitter bard. John Ireton â bit
ter and savage and unforgiving. Tou
knew the, wild blade of a half-score
years ago, and now you'd make the
Â«rrown man pay scot and lot for that
same youngster's misdeeds. Have you
never a touch of human kindliness in
you?" Â£
To . know how .this affected me you
must 'turn back to that place where I
have tried to picture out this man for
you. I said he had a gift to turn a wo
man's head or touch her heart. I should
have said that he could use this gift at
will on any one. For the moment I for
pot his cool disposal of me in the talk
with Captain Stuart; forgot how he had
lied to make me out a spy and so had
brought me to this pass. ? '->>
So I could only say: "Tou killed my
friend. Frank Falconnet. and â ** -
"Tush!" said he. "That quarrel died
nine years ago. Your reviving of it now
Is but a mask."
"For what?" I asked.
"For your Just resentment In sweet
Margery's behalf. Believe it or not. as
you like, but I could love you for that
blow you gave me, John Ireton. I had
been losing cursedly at cards that day.
and mine host's wine had a dash of
usequebaugh in it. I dare swear. At any
rate. I knew not what It was I said till
Tybee said It over for me."
"But the next morning you took a
cur's advantage of me on this very spot
and ran me through." I countered.
Â¦ "Name It what you will and let It go
at that. There was murder In your eye.
and you are the better swordsman. Tou
put me upon It for,liy life, and when
you gave me leave, I did not kill you, as
I might."
"No; you reserved me for this."
He took a step nearer and seemed
strangely agitated.
â¢"Vou forced my hand. John Ire
ton," he said, speaking low that
the others might not ; hear. "Tou
had her ear from day to day and used
your privilege against me. As an enemy
who merely sought my life for ven
geance's sake I could spare you; but as
a rival â "
I laughed, and sanity began to come
again. "Make an end of it," I said. "I'd
rather hear the muskets speak than
you".
For reply he took a folded paper from
his pocket and spread and held it so
that I might read. It was a letter from
my Lord Cornwallls. directing Captain
Falconnet to send his prisoner. Captain
John -Ireton, sometime lieutenant in the
Royal Scot Blues, under guard to his
Lordship's headquarters in South Caro
lina.
"Can you read It?" he asked.
I nodded.
"Well, this supersedes the colonel's
sentence. If I say the word to Ensign
Farquharson you will be remanded."
"To be shot or hanged a little later, I
suppose?"
"No. Have you any notion why my
Lord Charles is sending for you?"
"No," said I. In my turn; and. Indeed.
I had not.
' "He knows your record as an officer
and would give you a chance to 'list In
your old service."
"I would not take It â at your hands
or his."
"J'ou'd best take it. But in any event,
you'll have your life ana Honorable safe
conduct beyond the lines."
"Make an end," I said. "I understand
you will obey his Lordship's order or
disregard it. as your own interest directs.
What would you have me do?"
"A very little thing to weigh against a
life. Mr. Gilbert Stair Is my very good
friend."
I let that go uncontradicted.
"His title to the estate Is secure
enough, as you know, but you can make
it better." he went on.
This saying of his told me , what I
had only guessed; that as yet he had not
b*en admitted Into Gilbert Stair's full
confidence; also, that he had no hint of
what had taken place In my chamber
some hour or two past midnight. At that
a joy fierce like pain came to thrill me. -
"Go on," said L
Tonr route to Camden lias through
Charlotte. Tour guard will give you
time and opportunity to execute a Quit
claim in Mr. Stair's favor."
"Is that aUr I asked.
"No; after that our ways must lie
apartâ or yours and Margery's, at all
events. Give me your word of honor
that you will rellngulsh any claim you
have, or think you have, upon her. and
I pass this letter on to the ensign."
"And if I refuse T*
He came so near that I could sea the
lurking devil In his eyes.
"If you refuse?" Harken. John Ire
ton; if you had a hundred lives
to thrust between me and the thing
I crave. I'd take them all." So
much he aald calmly; then a sud
den gust of passion seized him.
and for once, I think, he spoke the sim
ple truth. "God: I'd sink my soul In
Calvin's hell to have her!"
I could not wholly mask the smile or
triumph that his words evoked. This
fox of maiden vineyards was entrapped
at last. I saw the tire of such a passion
as such a man may know burning In his
eyes; and then I knew why ho was coma
upon his errand.
"So?" said I. "Then Mistress Margery
sent you here to save me?" 'Twaa but
a guess, but I made sure it hit the truth.
He swore a sneering oath. "So the
priest carried tales, did he? Well, maka
the most of it; she would not have Her
father's guest taken from his bed a" rt
hanged like a dog."
I smiled again. " 'Twas more than
that; she would even go so far as to beg
her hushand's life a boon from that same
husband's mortal enemy."
"Bah!" he scoffed. "That He of yours
imposed upon the colonel, but I had bet
ter information."
"A lie. you say? True, 'twas a He when
It was uttered. But afterward, some hour
or so past midnight, by the good help of
Father Matthleu. and with your Lieu
tenant Tybee for one witness and the
lawyer for another, we made a sober
truth of it."
I hope, for your own peace of mind,
my dears, that you may never see a fel
low human turn devil in a breath as 1
did then. His man's face fell away from
him like a vanishing mask, and in the
place of It a hideous demon, malignant
and murderous, glared upon me. Twice
his hand sought the swordhilt. and once
the blade was half unsheathed. Then ha
thrust his devil-face in mine and hissed
his parting word at me so like a snake
It made me shudder with abhorrence.
'Tou've signed yoar own death war
rant, you witless fool! Tou'd play the
spoil-sport here as you did once before,
would you? Curse you! I wish you had
a hundred lives that I might take them
one by one!" Then he wheeled sharp
upon his heel and gave the order to the
ensign. "Belt him to the treÂ«, Far
quharson. and make an end of him. I've
kept you waiting over-long."
They strapped me to a tree with other
belts, and when all was ready the en
sign stepped aside to give the word. Just
here there came a little pause prolonged
beyond the moment of completed prep
aration. I knew not why they waited,
having other things to think of. I saw
the fixing line drawn up with muskets
leveled. I marked the row of weather
beaten faces pillowed on the gunstocks
with eyes asquint to sight the pieces. I
remember counting up the pointing muz
rles; remember wondering which would
be the first to belch Its fire at me, and
if, at that short range, a man might live
to see the Cash and hear the roar before
the bullets killed the senses.
But while !â¢ screwed my courage to tne
sticking- place and sought to hold It there,
the pause became a keen-edged agony.
A glance asideâ a glance that cost a
mightier effort than It takes to break a
nightmareâ showed me the ensign stand-
Ing ear a-cock. as one who listens.
"What he heard I know not. for all the
earth seemed hushed to silence waiting
on his word. But on the Instant the
early morning stillness of the forest
crashed alive, and pandemonium was
come. A savage yell to set the very leaves
a-tremble; a crackling volley from tha
underwood that left a heap of writhing,
dying men where but now the firing
squad had stood; then a headlong charge
of rough-clad horsemenâ all this befell
In leas than any time the written words
can measure.

She know she was gazing ypon the dread-
Marth glanced again at the letter in
the bark, then back at Amos, and looked
disgusted. ;
"I've never said I was a thlnkln' one
mite about the schoolteacher, have I? Â¦
"Not with yer mouth but ye've said
it up there with yer pocket knife." Amos
pointed at the big letter in the bark.
Marth turned a steady gaze, full of
fire, upon the man's face for a moment,
then lÂ«t her words fly.
"Amos Underwood." she snapped.
"ye're the biggest gump I ever saw. I
hate you; I despise you. Now, you go;
and I do hope the revenues will get you
this very, night." Â¦ ,
"Marth,. I"â Amos had taken off his

"No, ye don't!" Marth stamped her foot.
"Ye've said enough. Go!"
She pointed up the trail, and Amos
moved slowly away. , .
Marth had wound up her fish line by
the time Amos had gone from view, and
she turned toward the old beech a^aln 
"The crazy,", she murmured. He
couldn't remember his own name started
with A. Well, he's gone, and Im glad
of it. I do hate a man that can't see
with bis eyes open." .
The girl. followed the trail to the top
of the. ridge,. then turned off to the left
and went toward a cabin on the side of
the mountain.
At dusk she milked. the cows, then went
to the" spring for. a pall of water. As ehe
stood and began slowly to N dip the water
from the rocky. basin with a long-handled
gourd her quick e#r caught the sound of
hoof I beats - against i the , stones, and she
turned her ' head â¢ and .peered through the
woods to the right of her. Just across a
shallow ravine a trail led around the side
.of the mountain anÂ«J on this trail Marth's
eyts could now see three shadowy horses
and riders, and there was a gleam- of pol
ished metal which told the Â¦ girl ! that ' each
rider had a gun strapped to his back.

to me. Then I'd allers thought you loved

l^HgSssiiswrglBiiwJJ shadow lay over the
gorge, for the sun was behind a cloud.
The fish in the stream had not been
biting to suit a young flsherwoman and
she had thrust her pole Into the bank and
gone aside to carve something In the bark
of an old beech. Laboriously she worked
away, and at length had completed a sin
gle large A.
A man approached along the river trail
and stood directly behind thÂ» girl, watch
ing her. work. A flush passed over his
face when he saw the letter the girl had
carved and he frowned. Then he coughed
and the girl was startled. She turned
quickly around. *
"You, Amos?" she exclaimed.
"Me, Marth," was the answer..
"Why didn't you whistle or something,
â¢fore you got so close?"
"Wanted to see what you'er doln'."
Marth's face reddened slightly.
"Well?"
"Well, I see ye've got that school
teacher in yer mind."
" 'Taln't 60. Now I wonder what put
that in yer head?"
"I see ye're flxin* to carve his name."
Marth looked up at the letter in the
bark, then looked at Am 03 in silence.
"Don't reckon ye can hardly deny it,"
continued Amos, . Jealously, "for I don't
reckon you could say that letter stood
for anybody else around tnese parts but
Aldrich. So I put it up, yo're a thinkin'
a right smart about that same school
teacher."
"Amos Underwood, ye haven't got a
grain o' sense. Ye can't see two Inches

ing.
"I reckon you think so, Marth. But 'I
think I know what's what when a girl

.He extended his arms j toward Marth,
but I the girl backed sway.
. s "No time for that. Amos. Don't ye h#ar
them hoof -beats ?"Â¦
, The moonshiner caught the girl's hand,
and together they sprang into the laurel.
Five minutes later they stood on the rock
above the 5 stillhouse and , listened to ttle
work of destruction that was being 1 car
ried on by the raiders'* axes.- Â¦ Â¦
"Well, ye're safe anyhow, Amos," whis
pered Marth; and Amos, catching- her in
his arms, tousled her hair with his chin.
ed revenue officers and her thought flew
to Amos more than three miles away
down the ravine, where he would soon be
at work In the distillery. >
The girl- sat motionless until the riders
had passed a boulder which protruded
from the hillside. Then she seized her
pall and ran up the trail to the cabin.
There was but one thought in her head.
Amos must be warned and saved at. any
cost. , Saddling a small mule which she
led from the stable, she leaped upon his
back, dragged a shotgun up after- her
and rested it upon the animal's neck.
Then she set off along a trail which di
verged from that taken by the officers.
At least she reached a high rock over
looking a bluff; and she stopped and lis
tened Intently. Then, slipping down from
the saddle, she crept Into a laurel thicket
on one side of the rock, and. after a few
minutes, came out in the glare of a fur
nace fire. She was at' the doorway of
Amos Underwood's stlllhouse. Springing
through the opening she called his name.
Amos turned quickly, and his hand
grasped the butt of a revolver. But when
he saw Marth he allowed his chin to drop
to his breast and his hand fell limply to
his side. '
"Have ye brought 'em, Marth?" he
asked. .
"No, Amos, but they're comin*. an' I've
come all the way here to warn ye so's ye
could save yourself. I'm sorry for what 1
said, though I didn't reckon I'd ever own
it.". Â¦,,...Â¦ v - . Â¦ .
"I don't know how you class Mr. Win
ters," Phillipa said one evening. "He
isn't a fool, and hq doesn't seem"
"My dear," Claverlng remarked, "he Is
a demon of the deepest dye." They had
been sailing (with Winters) that after
noon In the rough waters around the
outer ledge and tha qualms of the deep
were still strong- upon mm.
He had never been a dancing man; yet
when Winters took Phillipa. to the Coun
try Club hop it was Uncle George who
managed to dance with her the greater
part of the evening. His waltzing re
minded one of some stately walk gone
wrong, and he was hopelessly tangled in
the figures of the* newer dances. Still,
with Spartan courage, he stuck to It, and
when finally Winters had spirited PhilHpa
to a corner of the veranda, where the
moonlight was . particularly suspicious.
Uncle George came strolling up with \ a
cheerfully obtuse smile on his perspiring
face.
The day of the hunt he rode afield after
the pair, taking fences that sent shivers
coursing up and down his spine and put
ting his horse to water Jumps which ma
terially Increased his gray hairs. Wher
ever his niece might be, there was Uncle
George. He was "keeping and eye on
Phillips."
To those who knew Mr. Claverlng, his
behavior during the next few weeks was
Inexplicable. When Winters took Phil
lipa to the links, Uncle George went with
them, although it was known that, hith
erto, a mere mention of golf would suf
ficient to open the flood gates of his vi
tuperation. ;:Â¦
Claverlng bristled perceptibly.
"The young men of this place," he an
nounces oracularly, "are of two classes
fools and demons."
"I think I shall prefer the demons,"
said Phillipa sweetly.
PhilHpa had not been two days at The
Cedars when Roderick Winters came over
to smoke an evening cigar with Claver
lng. Winters was 2S and not particularly
impressionable. However, when his eyes
met Phillipa's he was as clay In the pot
ters' hand. Clavering saw It was the be
ginning; he took a long breath, aa one
who Intends to run a good race-.
fore him anri his heart sank.
"It's a. mighty quiet place here," he ex
plained.
"I saw some awfully interesting look-
Ing men as we drove over from
the station," she said. "I'm sure you
know a lot of them."

THE PERPLEXING INITIAL
"A landscape!" mentally exclaimed
Marian, as'ehe recalled his dislike of land
scapes. "How he must hate me," she
continued, eating another candy, "when
he'd rather look at that than at. me! I
wonderâ what had I ought to do? If he
and I were utter strangers, lost on a des
ert isle, and he had a dozen kernels of
corn, I should think him a cad if he didn't
offer me half. I think I ought to offer
him com? of these candles, even If we're
not on speaking terms."
Then, sitting back, and with eyes
straight ahead, Marian pushed the candy
box along the seat. Allen paid no atten
tion.
"Won't you have a chocolate?" Marian
asked at length, hesitatingly.
Allen made no answer.
"Will you"â and Marian stamped her
little footâ "I say, will you have a choco
late?" she continued Impatiently.
"No, I thank you," he replied, and re
sumed his contemplation of the landscape.
A long pause ensued. The box remained
half way between them.
"I think you're veryâ ungentlemanly,"
ventured Marian.
"1-ast night you were of the same opin
ion/' retorted Allen.
"You are more so now.'*,
HOW â¢ Â¦ . * i
"Well, j'ouâ you know that I'm too po
lite to eat these chocolates and let you
j:o hungryâ and I'm simply starved."
After she had eaten several of the can
dles she glanced over at Allen. Fastened
to the wall of the cabin opposite him was
an old landscape In a dingy frame, and
he was gazing at this with the concentra
tion of a stole.
"Well, I suppose it can't be helped,
then," submitted Marian, but she ap
peared bo very much annoyed that Abe at
once leaned down and continued his work
with a great show of bustle.
The rain was not yet over, and Allen
was busily engaged staring very hard at
nothing whatever. Marian looked at her
watch. It was past lunch time, and, as
she had felt too miserable to eat much at
breakfast, she commenced to feel hungry.
A sudden thought brightened her coun
tenance: she had with her a box of can
dles which she had purchased for her sis
ter's children. She could get them an
other box. She looked at her watch
again. Only a few minutes more had
passed, but her hunger had now become
unbearable.
She loosed the string from the box.

ate a chocolate.
"Well, sometimes. But now last week
ehe didn't break down, Monday nor
Wednesday, all the hull way over!" And,
Baying this. Old Abe rose to his full
height, grinning with pride.
cllmbed around to the all-Important pad
dle wheel. After an exasperating wait
of perhaps twÂ«nty minutes Marian peered
out from the door, and seeing no one
called:
"Mr. Ferryman!" She was now heartily
wishing she had stayed at the house.
"I'm awful sorry. Miss," answered the
old man, rather dolefully, "but I'm 'fraid
it'll take a teenty bit longer. You see,
It's worse'n I thought."
"Do you have to stop like this often?"
asked Marian.
Mr. Clavering laid the note on the li
brary table with a perplexed frown. He
was a widower of several years* standing,
and, moreover, he was childless. The
ways of this, younger generation of rirls
he knew nothing about When he had
asked his sister to send her daughter to
him for a month he had mentally pictured
Phillipa as still 13, clad in muslin frocks
and made perennially happy by a simple
supply of sweetmeats.
Phillipa cameâ a happy, charming; ra
diant creature, with a pair of dark eyes
that would melt a stone and a silvery
laugh that' would thrill a graven Image.
Clavering felt a glow of avuncular pride
as he beheld her: at the same time he
realized that magnitude of the task t>e-
his warmest regards. Tour affectionate
sister. ALICE."
At this point a thunder shower, which
had for a time back been steadily ap
proaching, broke over the lake. Allen,
not df siring a drenching, rose to his feet
and went into the cabin.
In the darkening interior he saw no one,
and eat down on the middle of the seat
with a sigh, putting his elbows on his
knees and face in hands.
Marian was sitting but an arm's length
from him. After an awkward pause spent
in cogitation Ehe coughed lightly. Allen
â¢started to his feet directly, and, with a
bow, said:
"I do beg your pardon, madam: Iâ"
And then a flash lighted the cabin for an
instant, and he plainly saw his com
panion's face.
"I thought I was alone," he added.
Bimply, and awkwardly backing to the
farther Â«nd of the seat, sat down.
There was some reason for these seem
ingly strange actions. It was but the
previous evening that they had quarreled
and at the end he had fiercely taken back
the ring Â£he proffered, and they had part
ed forever.
At length. "Why are we stopping here?"
asked Marian of the boatman, who sat
at his pcet in perfect tranquillity.
"Jest a rcrew loose, miss," the old man
replied. "I figger I know where 'tis now,
and we'll be goin' again in a Jifty."
And with that Old Abe. tools lv hand.
Alien didn't know, as a matter of fact,
where he was going, nor did be care. He
had seen the old man puttering about the
boat, and on learning that a start would
Boon be made for somewhere, he bad list
lessly taken a seat for the trip.
With a loot of the squeaky whistle the
boat got under way. Marian, wishing to
stand in the prow, walked through the
cabin. But at sight of her fellow pas
senger she turned pink with embarrass
ment and quickly retreated and sat down
on the long carpet-covered seat that was
built through the middle of the cabin.
Under the guidance of the Jubilant old
man the boat advanced in a very satis
factory mannerâ at least to himâ until
about half way across the lake. Here the
paddle wheel refused to continue re\'olv
lng, and, after some minutes of drifting,
tho boat was still.

himself: "Two. Two."
The rear third of Abe's stern-wheeler
was a pilot house and engine room, the
cestrtl portion was cabin, and in front
wae what may be termed a deck. On
this deck was seated the other of Abe's
"two" p&Esengers, Alonzo Allen, of New
Tcrk.

Phillipa. She - stopped abruptly and
flushed.
Clavertrg looked at them In stunned si

"As long as you've got the hang of It

spin, while we decide where we'll spend
our honeymoon?"
Clavering smiled weakly. "If you'll
trust me with the machine. Rod." he said.
"I'll wobble to the station and telegraph

Some twenty minutes later the red
touring-car appeared on the crest of the
hill, coming in their direction. In it was

triumphant. He brought his serpentine
course to a finish in front of Winters and
Philllpa.
"I've got the hang of It now," he cried
Joyfully. "Stopped her all by myself:
turned her round, too. Knocked a piece
out of Crelgh ton's fence, but I've got the
hang of it, anyway."
Winters' drooping spirits seemed to
have revived.
"You left us rather unceremoniously.
Claverlng," said he. "And the method of
your departure rather worried ua. too.
But while you were gone â "
"You steer with this, eh?" said Uncle
George, "and start it with thisâ eo." Th*
touring-car started ahead. "Ha I
thought so. How do you stop her? Heyl
Rod, how do you stop her?"
A sudden inspiration came to Winters.
"Shove that lever down," he shouted;
"way down."
The car sprang ahead at full speed.
Claverlng gasped and shouted something:
which was lost In the roar of the laboring
gear. Steering wildly, the car reeling
from one side of the road to the other,
he went banging up the road and disap
peared over the crest of a little hill In a
cloud of dust.
"Oh." cried Phillipa In dismay. "Oh.
how could you! He may be killed."
"He deserves to be." . said Winters
grimly.
"Oh, I say. Miss Trent," he said; "this
is your last day here, and I haven't
shown you the Knob. Shan't wt take a

"Delightful." murmured Ph filly*, rUtajr.
"See here,'* said Claverin*. "I haven't

"Join us by all means," said Winters,
with a cheerfulness marked "eouaterfatt**

The prospective departure of Phillipa
seemed to affect the two men very dif
ferently. All the afternoon, during- the
ride and the climb to the summit of the
Knob, Clavering was as light-hearted as
a boy. "Winters was taciturn almost to
sullenness. Phillipa was pensive.
When It was time to return Clavering
climbed Into the car first and fondled
the brakes and levers.
"I believe I could run the thing my

"Simple as A, B, C," said Winter*.
It was the last day of Phllllpa's stay

WHILE WAITING FOR REPAIRS
WITH AN EYE ON PHILLIPA
By T. B. Eaton
With an air of exaggerated politeness,
Allen reached over, took a candy and ate
it, his eyes fixed the while upon the land
scape. Marian then ate one, waited in
silence for ten minutes, and again offered
the box to Allen, who helped himself very
gravely and handed it back.' The opera
tion was repeated until soon only one
candy was left. The remaining one was
heart-shaped.
Allen handed the box to Marian. She
took the box, but directly offered It back
to him.
"No, thank you," said Allen, on looking
In the box. '
"But I am offering It to you," insisted
Marian.
"It's yours," replied Allen, and he shot
a quick glance at Marian, who had been
gradually moving from her end of the
seat and was now past the middle. She
slightly raised from her seat, and, leaning
toward him, said:
"L.onâ pardon me â Mr. Allen, please
take it; I want you to have it."
"Is itâ do you meanâ you are offering
me a heart?" he asked. 1
Bhe might have answered, but tho boat
suddenly started with a Jerk, throwing
her full Into his arms. And there she was
when the boatman appeared in the door

enough.
"Weâ" and Marian looked at Allen,
"we're not blaming you, Mr. Ferryman."
"No; and we'll take the trip back with
you," added Allen.
"Thank >, thank *e, sir," replied Old
Abe, and. a? he went back to his work,
there was a merry twinkle In his eye. And

"There is where most people make their
great mistake in carving. They go at a

presently, but there Is no occasion for

After five minutes more of 'Vcientlflo
principles" he seized a leg and began a
Burgicai operation on the patient's thigh
bone.
At this point the cherub of love dis
covered that he had business elsewhere,
and the little dt vil of acrimony came sail
ing in to take the vacant place. The hus
band, by the divine right of muscular
power, retained possession of the carving
utensils and procteued upon scientific
principles. That is, he surveyed the bird
from all sides, and wondered whether his
two Ftumpy leps ought to be pulled out
by fhe root? ns a first movement. He
might have attempted it but for the wife,
who Btemed to divine his thought, and
said:
"I don't like to have you speak to mÂ«
In thRt tone. I have proved to you that
I know how to bake a turkey, and I wi'.l
now prove that I know how to carve one
as well. Let me have the knife and

"What! I have never carved a tur

you. You could never have possibly
carved anything beyond a quail, and I
will row give you your first lesson."
"It wouid be such a pity to haggle it."
"Who's going to haggle? You talk as
If I had never seen a turkey. You
wouldn't know how or whtri to begin. If
you started in."
"George." she said, as she brought the
carvlr.g utensils from the pantry with a
blush Â£t her forgetfulness. "you have
never carved a turkey In your life,

"It is it* finest one I ever saw," said
the wife, as she touched up the table
here and there before eittlng down.
"And only the nicest little woman in
the world eoulJ have prepared It thus,"
Â¦was thf reply, accompanied with a kiss.
A Thanksgiving turkey must be carved
before it is eaten. This fact suddenly
stared bnsb&nd and wife In the fÂ»ce. and
for a n:oment each looked anxious and
perturbed. Then their faces cleared
tlmu'.tareously.

Their firm quarrel was on the tupie. but
both restrained themsflves and happily
averted it. The turkey was put aside on
Ice until it should go Into the oven next
Â£ay. arid the cherub of love continued
to nestle. â¢

As she left the room to don her out
door garments he resumed work. Ha
twisted the bird's legs down and his wins*
up, and then reversed the motion, but
nothing gave way. Then he resumed rHa
tunneling operations, hut struck such nat
ural obstructions that he had to abandon
the work again and look around for thÂ«
ax. There was no ax, no handsaw, no
crowbar. In furnishing his house he had
forgotten that these things might be ia
demand on Thanksgiving day.
By and by, however, by faithful work,
aided by lucky accident; he dislodged a
bit of meat and paused to taste it. It
was turkey on the raw. Then he perse
vered until he succeeded in bringing to
light a spoonful of stuffing. It was stuf
fing a la paste. "Mother's old-fashioned
cocking" had been outdone.
Ten minutes later, when the young wiTe
re-entered the room, clothed for the
street, but feeling that she was only
making a bluff of it. she was surprised
to find her husband smoking and smillns.
"Come and kiss me. pet." ha said ia
his old loving tones.
"But whereâ where?" she asked, as she
looked at the table.
"Where Is the turkey? Oh, the poor
bird won't bother us any more. I droppo.l
it out of tha window Just in time to hit
a passing Alderman on the head."
"But George, I don't understand."
"Well. then, my dear. I got caught
with the oldest gobbler in town. You
knew no more about baking him than a
child, and neither of us knows enough to
carve a boiled turnip. Take off your
things, pet. and we'll eat up the cold po
tatoes and the cranberry sauce and be
thankful that Thanksgiving has done so
well for us that we are able to feast thÂ«
street with roast turkey."
"That's simply butchery. If my father
had known what sort of man you were
he'd never have given h'.sâ "
"And I wish he hadn't." snapped
George, as hÂ« flourished the knife and
fork in the air.
"Do you say that to me. George Pear
son? I go back to my mother to-morrow.
I have found out at last what a villain
you are, and "
"And It makes me tired. If j'ou had let
me alone In the first place I should have
had the carving a" done by now.
"You have never carvedâ you will never
know enough to carve, and I can put on
my things and go over to my sister's to
night. When I am gone you can cut ani
thrust, pull and haul, twist and wrigsle.
and when you get ready you may eat
your Thanksgiving dinner alone.
"A dinner which would have been a
little love feast but for your foolish and
unwifely interference." .
"Thank you, sirâ thank you.
But he grasped the legs and pulled and
yanked and wrenched .until hÂ« even
moved the table about.
It wai no go. The bird declined to give
Â¦way to any such treatment.
When failure was realized the husband
picked up knife and fork again to work
upon another new Idea. Me would con
struct a subway to tap the Interior and
make it yield up Its stuffing. He began
cutting a hole In the side, but had not
drifted In very far when the wife cried
out through her tears:
"Taken, one leg in each hand, and sufficient muscular exertion used, the bird ought % to rip open like
a squash." ,
as If you had a razor In. ytraf hand. You
want to cut around the leg and bend It
up to sl?p the bone out of Its socket."
"Not If I am a man instead of a wolf."
he hotly rpplied. "You bend the leg down
âalways down."
"You never do."
"You always do." .
"Will you please remember that I am
the head of this house."
"One of the heads only."
Then followed a lull, during which the
husband planned a . campaign and set
about carrying out the details. When hÂ«
came to look more closely at the body
before him on the big platter he con
ceived the idea that nature designed the
legs to help a man out of a Thanksgiving
fix. Taken one In each nand and suf
ficient muscular exertion used the bird
ought to rip open like a ripe squash.
Such a feat would save half the carving.
"You mustn'tâ you can'tâ you shan't!"
cried the wife, aa she fathomed his inten
tions.
"Madam, stand back."
"I won't do it. You might as well call

"I have been writing for five years.

whether she had fainted or been bound,
we could not tell, until suddenly, a clear,
sharp cry rang out, and every man
lowered his gun at the sound. It was a
cry for help, we believed, and we sent
back a shout that echoed In long leaps
up the deep ravines and gulches. For an
instant the firing from the rock ceased,
then began again, faster than ever, but
not so Bure. All at once the voice of SUn
shouted from above.
"For God's sake, boys, quit firing!"
It was hard to obey with victorv so
near, and the bullets flying wild around
our heads from the hidden hand behind
the rock. But we stopped, they did also,
and we scrambled from ledge to ledge up
over the ragged, splintered stones, until
the top was gained, and we looked down
on Larry and his captive.
It was a strange sight. Back against
the rough, gray rocks stood Quita. her
eyea aflame with reckless courage and
defiance. Larry's two revolvers were
gripped, still smoking, in her hands. At
her feet lay Larry, his white face up
turned to the dawning lisht. and a dull,
crimson stain soaking the right side of
his gray flannel shirt.
"I'll shoot the first one that dares to
touch him." called Quita. "You're a pack
of cowards to follow and hold us up like
this. What's he done?"
"HÂ© stole you."
It was Sim who answered her.
Quita turned on him like a flash.
"He didn't steal me, Sim. I ran away
with him because I loved him, and it
seemed better to go at the last moment
than to marry you and love him all the
same. I thought a girl could choose the
man she loved and not have a whole camp
chase her and shoot him down. You don't
play fair, boys."
There was a dead silence. Her eyes
were full of tears and Happy Chance
hid its head in shame. It is not pleasant
to have a gallant rescue Knocked in tha
head by the scorn of a woman's will.
But Sim stood without shama or anger
and stared at the white, young face at
Quita's feet, and at last, without a wcrd.
he went down and lifted Larry in his
arms and made his way with him to the
trail and Quita followed slowly.
At Prospera we left the three and Sim
never gave up his guard until the wound
was healed and Quita rode into camp be
side her husband as Mrs. I^arry Carroll.
There were no hard feelings. As Larry

of the action of the phagocytes In the
blood, which was made by his investiga
tions at the Pasteur Institute. These uni
cellular ori.an.sms in the life fluid during
the period of youth prey upon the mi
crobes in the blood, thereby preventing
their harmful influence by destroying
them: but with the advance of age these
merciful scavengers of the blood are
forced to seek the vital organs themselves
for their sustenance, and thus they induce
premature decay of the heart, the brain
and the other life-sustaining mechanlsmj
of the body.
Science, which has done so much with
dis'-:ise-pr<>\entive serums and anti
toxins, will Inevitably discover an injec
tiuii uf lymph into the blood which will
nourish these phagocytes and thus deter
them^from their destructive depredations
on old a^e. A normal old age will be the
result. Man, who has lived a clean exist
ence, will pass Into the mellow fall of life
with the buoyant spirit of Marcus Aure
llus.
"Do not abuse death," said the philoso
pher. "Do we not pass on from Infancy to
youth, grow up and become tall and at
tain manhood? Do not our teeth come,
our beards grow and our hair turn white?
If we marry do we not beget children?
Are not all such events in their due sea
son and the work of nature? Death comes
through the same agency. It, therefore,
behooves a wise man to approach death
with neither anger, repugnance nor con
- tempt, but to wait It like any other ope
ration of nature."
(G. B. Putnam's Sons, New York; Illus
trated; price $2 00.)
That the love of life, to which the aged
ding with desperation, should Increase
after the best that is in life has been long
since lived, is a remarkable evidence of
the effect of the inharmonious elements
of our nature. If we have lived our life
to the utmost of Its possibilities, says
Metchnikoff, why should we fear death?
Is it that we do not dare think of absolute
extinction? Is It the beyondâ the invisi
ble â that we fear? No, replies the scien
tist; it is because the disharmonies of our
existence have so wrought upon our
bodies by their concomitant diseases that
we die before our time is full come â we
perish before the instinct of death comes
to close our eyes in a natural dissolution.
But how is it with those who die from
"old age," as the physicians term itâ is
not the love for life equally strong with
them? And yet they die as the result of
no seeming disease.
Metcbnlkotl answers this with his final
argument, based upon his own discovery
In the digestive apparatus of man,
Metchnikoff cites the appendix as an ex
ample of a rudimentary organ which
serves no purpose and which, as we all
know, is one of the fruitful causes for dis
ease. The wisdom teeth, a large portion
of the digestive tract and the complicated
and often useless mechanism of the eye
all come under the scientist's sweeping
designation of disharmonies. In a very
careful study of the physiology of repro
duction Metchnikoff finds many other in
congruities. Then, to clinch his argument,
the author shows the disharmonies in the
instinct of self-preservation, which, per
haps, is the strongest of our instinctive
sensations.
After reviewing the testimony advanced
to deduce the fact of the simian origin of
man, Metchnikoff undertakes the unfold
ing of the main argument of his bookâ
the disharmonies in the physiological na
ture of man and the effects of these dis
harmonies upon his mental life. This
done, he introduces his theory of the pro
longation of life by scientific treatment
calculated to counteract the effects of
these disharmonies.
selection and the Inheritance of acquired
characteristics. After showing the ex
tinction of the mammoth through inabil
ity to adapt itself to the altered climatic
conditions of his habitat and citing nu
merous other instances of a like nature
Metchnikoff says:
'â¢These facts do not bear testimony to
the prevalent idea that there exists in
nature a law of universal progress tend
ing to the production of organisms more
and more perfect from the point of view
of complex.ty of structure. It is incon
testable that forms higher in the scale of
life have developed only after the appear
ance of lower forms. But It does not fol
low that development always takes a pro
gressive march. Man is one of the later
species that have appeared upon the
earth, but there are others of still more
recent date. It is among man's parasites
that we must look for the latest products
of creation."
To the special features of the diction
ary generous approbation is also due.
There are nearly 6000 illustrations to the
text. It is well supplied with maps,
necrological tables, census statistics and
valuable cyclopedic information. The
typographical work and arrangement of
the fever quickly subsided. There was no
necessity to catch words hot from the
bat, so alarmingly abundant â super
abundantâare those that have had time
to cool. The constant instruction to the
editors of the various departments was to
exclude every word that could be omitted
without Injury. Take this fact: there
were on our vocabulary cards over 500,
000 terms, every one having been 'located'
In some book or reputable periodical. We
threw out neck and crop over 200,000 of
these by the rigid application of the fol
lowing rule of exclusion: Omit all words
that would not be Inquired after by a
considerable number of people."
Practicability Is the prime excellence ot
' the new "Standard." To define a word
merely by some synonym leaves the in
quirer after the truth as much at sea as
In the beginning. The average man roes
to a dictionary .to find one or more of
three things about a wordâ Its correct
spelling. Its correct pronunciation, its
most, common present meaning. Tne busy
man does not wish to read first the root
of the word, then its historical tracing
through | Sanskrit, Greek . and - Latin and
finally its modern meaning. "The Stand

method of giving the latest current mean-
Ing of the term directly after the word It
self and then following with -its history.
As was to be expected from the terri

The book is the fruit of a â¢ flying trip
through the Land of To-Morrow. The
author leads us over the border from
France by Port Bou, the gate of the
Pyrenees, through the north of Spain by
way of Barcelona, Saragossa and Lerlda
to Madrid. Thence his narrative carries
us into Andalusia, through Toledo and
Cordova, to Granada, the Alhambra, and
at last out of Spain by the iron gate of
the Gibraltar. But It is not upon the
typical "grand tour" that the author-ed
itor leads his readers: the hurry and
rush of the ordinary sight-seeing* tour
ist. Wh6n Hart finds something which
strikes his fancy â the bell-ringer* of
Glralda. the make-up of a Spanish
newspaperâ he pauses and rets all the
meat out of the subject before he leaves It
to go on.
A whimsical humor characterizes the
Calif or nian tourist's work. He loves to
catch the odd side of things and turn It
Into a smile. That a beggar should rids
a-horseback and demand a largesse from
the humbler wayfarer on foot tickle*
Hart, and he in turn passes the laugh on
to his reader, reinforced by the dry hu
mor of the telling. One gains the Idea
from "Two Argonauts in Spain" that its
genial creator was drifting easily along
through Spain, always ready to see some
new thing and more than willing to see
'some funny thing.
The author very effectually tears the
veil from ''sunny Spain." Those of us who
have dreamt of Spain as a place where
people lie under palm trees In hammocks
and lazily chew pomegranate pips feel al
most as we did when we discovered who
Santa Claus was upon reading* what Hart
has to say of the weather.
"Never in my life," say* he, "have I
seen such wrapping and muffling; as ' I
saw in Spain. The 'men wear very heavy
cloaksâ heavier than any outer "garment
we have in America, except fur-coats.
"They know their climate and Its treach
eries better than strangers. -But I would
not exchange the climate of California for
that of sunny Andalusia. Still! since I
have seen the Spaniards muffle themselves
up, all over sunny Spain, and even in
sunny Andalusia, I have concluded that
one may admit the occasional necessity
of an overcoat even in California.
"One of the* reasons for such careful
muffling is the Spanish terror of pneu
monia".: Not only in Madrid, but through
out all Spain, this fear seems to be felt.
It may be folly for a stranger to under
rate the dangerâ when traveling, it is
usually wise to do as the natives do. But
one cannot Ignore the variable climate of
Spain; the torrid sunshine and arctic
in excellent dress under the name of
Payot, Upham & Co., the local publishers.
The keynote of Mr. Hart's work is its
engaging sketchiness and breezlness of
thought and diction. There is no attempt
to delve into musty figures and produce
Government tables of the number of An
gora goats in Andalusia, or the per capita
tax in Saragossa for the last fifty years.
There are no rhapsodical passages upon
moonlight at the Alhambra. None of the
earmarks of the time-honored books of
travels are apparent in Hart's collection
of thumb-nail sketches.
JEROME HART, the genial editor of
the San \ Francisco Argonaut, has
given us a very readable book of
travel in his "Two Argonauts in Spain."
With his letters sent from abroad to his
periodical as a foundation, Hart has elab
orated upon the originals and written
enough new material to make a good
sized volume, which is printed on the Ar
gonaut press, and which is brought out
Argonauts in Spain.
"In my experience the great strain is
to keep words out of the dictionary, not
in compassing sea and land to ilnd
words to make it larger. While making
it, the increasing size of our dictionary
was a source of constant anxiety. The
limit which commercial requirements had
fixed was 2100 quarto pages. If .we ever
had 'a heated enthusiasm for bigness"
of the "Standard" with a view of ( regis
tering every word; extant in the. hugnsh
language, whether, it is archaic -"or very
freshly t'colloqulal. A They t 'jKave acted *>n
the very sound theory that the business
of a dictionary is not to make a language
but to ' record Â¦ usage.. To ;. under iuÂ«.e . iu
dictate what words the -people should use
would be an Impertinence. 1 Â¦ But , the
"Standard" editors have wisely cnarac
terized obsolete or: slang .words as. such,
and thus while they recognize Ihelr pres
ence in the language, they act at the
same time as wIbb censors oT the pub
,lic 6peech. Dr. Isaack Funk, editor-in
chief of the new work, thus characterizes
the efforts of the board of editors in this
respect: '.
Really, were one to read Â¦ the Standard

handsome tone which should be put on
your library shelf alongside of your

And now for the (iris; there are plen
ty of fine books for them. First there 1*
the "Outlook Fairy Book." by Laura
Winnington. All of the old stories
about the brave tin soldier, the magic
tinder box and goldlocks are herein re
told for the little folks. The stilted
language of the old German and Han*
Christian Andersen book* 1* softened so
that the little one doesn't have to 1
terrupt her mother with, "What does that
word mean 7" Beside* the stories of
hobgoblins and beautiful princesses there
are several little ballads and some trans
lations'from the French and German
folk stories which make the "Outlook
Fairy Book" a complete library of de
lightful Btories.
(The Outlook Company, New York. Il
lustrated; price, $1 20.)
Again for the boys is George Ade's
"Circus Day." illustrated by John T. Mo-
Cutcheon. Since that old story. "Ten
Weeks With a Circus" (was It called?)
there has been no circus story for the
little fellows and this book is sure to
win its way to the Juvenile heart. It
is really not a story â not much of a
plot to it or anything Ilk* thatâ but
it tells how Joe Wallace and Shaver
Thompson saw the world'* greatest
hippodrome and refined menagerie Just
like any other boy would see them and
that is what the boy likes. He wishes
he was there. Perhaps the boy's father
will read the book also and wish he was
a barefoot youngster going to the circus
again himself.
(Saalfleld Publishing Company. Price,
CO cents.)
There is another book which is gen
erally supposed to be for grown-ups but
which in reality is best suited for boys;
that Is Cyrus Townsend Brady's "Sir
Henry Morgan. Buccaneer." Brady
might have thought that the elders
would take his book seriously and read
it as a romance, but really there is too
ruuch of the cut and thrust in it for the
average mature reader and enough of
pirates and black flags to catch the
youngster and hold him to the tale.
Brady should have designated the fact
that he had written a boys' book when
"Sir Henry Morgan" came from the
presses.

ja Â»O little curly head should want for
/V books when Santa Claus comes
1 * around this Christmas. Already
the Eastern publishers have turned
out books and more books for children.
There are Indian stories for the boys,
stories of meadows and cowslips for
little girls and books of Jingles with
bright pictures enough to delight the
hearts of all the toddlers.
Probably one of the best books for
boys â and grown-ups too. mind you â is
Stewart Edward White's "Magic For
est." This author can make more
things come out of the woods and be
revealed to the reader than any present
day writer about nature save possibly
Henry Van Dyke. He knows tha story
of the birch trees; he tells the every
day life of the fox and the beaver; he
gives one little glimpses Into the homes
of the forest birds. In this, his latest
book, there is Just enough about Indians
and thrilling canoe rides to keep young
Johnny or Teddy on the jump until he
has closed the covers on the little story.
Some excellent illustrations add to the
value of the tale.

In "The Adventures of Dorothy" Joce
lyn Lewis has made a winsome little stor y
for girls. Dorothy, who ia an active, lit
tle girl of about 10 year3 of age spends a
long summer on a farm, her first experi
ence of country life. She opens her In
vestigation of the farm by releasing the
hens which with their chickens make
great havoc in Aunt Nancy's flowerbeds.
Then she discovers the brook and there
meets Peter Van Campen. a sober little
German boy, who forthwith becomes her
devoted friend and champion. She dis
tinguishes their first meeting by falling
into the brook, but as is always the case,
her clothes are the only things to suffer.
They become Dorothy's one trial, as
Aunt Nancy's New England soul revolts
at the wanton destruction and limits her
to three dresses a day. But in spite of
this small cloud on her horizon Dorothy
manages to have as good a time and get
into as much mischief as any little girl
could. '' , â

Metchnikoff then launches into the ab
sorbing subject of harmonies and dishar
monies In lower creations and in man
kind. It is on this topic that be takes
exception to some of the tenets of Dar
win. The great English scientist held
that the evolution of species was a pro
gressive process of the gradual per
fection of the organism through natural
There is another striking note in Metch
nikofTs philosophy which must be under
stood before any attempt is made to fol
low the inductive reasoning by which he
seeks to establish his theory of old age.
This is his attitude toward man in the
grand scheme of the universe. Most phi
losophers and scientists are prone to make
human nature the culminatlve point in the
plan of things created and with human
nature as a starting point to work down
and around in other forms of life. Not so
â¢with Metchnikoff. Human nature -is for
him merely the apex In the ascending
Ecale of organisms; not a point of depart
ure, but the point of highest water mark
in the great life tide. For what distin
guishes the man from the starfish? Sen
sibility, consciousness, immortality, says
the theologian. But Metchnikoff demon
strates that the microscopical phagocytes
In the blood fluid have a consciousness of
their existence and demonstrate both that
and a sense of feeling by their actions.
He shows that the smallest infusoria by
their constant reproduction by fission ex
hibit the only form of immortality which
can be demonstrated by science. Man is
the near brother to the tree, to the jelly
fish on the seashore, in that with them he
possesses common characteristics.
In common with the works of the great
English scientists MetchnlkofTs book will
come under the ban of dogmatic religion
ists. For, Hke Huxley, Tyndal and Spen
cer, Metchnikoff accepts nothing which
cannot be proven by science. There is no
set of tissues in the body which are the
seat of a soul, hence there is ho soul.
There Is nothing to prove that immortal
ity exists, hence immortality Is a myth
conjured up by all sorts and conditions of
men in all ages as a solace for the Ills of
the body and the troubles of the mind. In
his introduction the author endeavors to
point out that philosophy and religion
alike have arisen from the disharmonies
of human existence, being in themselvej
only attempts to reconcile our imperfect
happiness and blighted physical well be
ing with the general conception of a be
nign nature.
The one aim of life is. then, according
to Metchnikoff's theory, not the prepara
tion for a life hereafterâ for he does not
tolerate the conception of immortality â
but to live our life as given us here on
this earth to the full limit of its years.
Instead of a pitiful decay and the ago
nies of senility. Metchnikoff would have
the eventide of man's life the most noble
and highly honored of his whole exist
ence. The old Grecian Council of the An
cients would find its counterpart in the
re\-ered old age of the future which
Metchnikoff would establish. Man would
live on and on in the full possession of his
faculties until the instinct of death would
steal over him like the Instinct of sleep,
and, weary, he would lay him down to the
final oblivion.
"ICcrality shculd be based not on hu
man nature la its exlstinr vitiated con
dition, but oa hnicsa nature. Ideal, as It
u-.ay be in the future.
"It is absurd to expect anything to
fellow death but absolute annihilation."
â The Kctaxe of Mas.
a DARING venture Into new fields
jlX of thought is always hailed as a
momentous event by scholars. But
when the explorer into the abstruse mys
teries of philosophy and higher science
has the power to make h:s discoveries not
only a rirh gift to the narrow cult of the
erudite, but a message clear and force
ful to be heard by the people, then he
has, indeed, achieved a preat work. This
has .-. Elie Metchnikoff done with his
book. "The Nature of Man."
It ts rarely that science and philosophy
link arms. Fro:n the time when Buddha
preached to his disciples his scheme of
life and the porch phiiosophfrs of Athens
soiipht to read the riddle of the universe
down to the present day of grace, the
world has se<-n its wise men who endeav
or'-d to chain the universe by a system
Â«'f major and rjfnor premises. Then in the
last century arose the school o* the scien
tists who attacked the creation v 'i'h scal
pel and microscope. Darwin preached his
jrreat sermon of thinps as they are. Wal
lace adde<? some afterthoughts. Huxley
and Fencer hrcan to r?ad science into
their philosophy. Hut now comes Meteh
r.IkofT. pupil of the preat Pasteur, himself
a physician, zoologist and botanlft, and
pivrs to the world a scheme for the phi
losophy of life which Is based upon the
fa^ts of science.
Other philosophers hare declared that
this was the worst of all possible worlds;
that the phenomenon of human existence
was a cruel joke of nati:re; that man's
only boon lay in his inevitable extinction.
Other scientists have decreed that man is
the freak chi!d of the anthropoid apes;
that he is the ultimate p lint of perfection
in the preat scheme of evolution; that he
must die like his kind, so that his body
will not encumber the earth when his use
fulness in the great scheme is spent.
Metchnikoff accepts some or these tenets,
modifies others, rejects still others and
adds to the total a distinctly new note,
which Is philosophical In conception and
scientific in proof.
Man is far from being physiologically
perfect, says Metchnikoff. From the xnany
apparer.t incongruities or "disharmonies"
of his body there arise a multitude of
physical and mental ailments, which has
ten old ape and a premature death. Death
Is feared by man above all the phenomena
of his existence. But is not death one of
the natural processes of nature? That
man should fear death more than sleepâ
anothÂ»r natural process of nature â must
be due to these very disharmonies in his
physical constitution. Should man learn
to eradicate these disharmonies, trusting
to science alone to accomplish his purpose,
there would be no more fear of death.
Life would be prolonged many years then
and dissolution would only come when
the instinct of death overcame the indi
vidual whose vital organs had become
weakened, not through the ravages of
disease arising from these selfsame dis
harmonies, but as a result of the simple
course of nature.
"But to modify the human constitu
tion, it will be necessa:f first to frame
an Ideal and thereafter to set to work
with all of the resources of science. If
there can be formed no Ideal able to
unite mea In a kind or religion of the
future, the Ideal must be founded on sci
entific principles. And If It be true, as
has beea asserted so often, that maa
cannot live by faith alone, the faith
must be la the power or science.
"The normal end, comlns" after the ap
pearance of the instinct of death, may
truly be regarded as the ultimate goal

To plan to make a happy Thanksgiving for others is the best kind of
preparation for the day. My grandfather used always on Thanksgiving mom
ing to give every aninial in the barn a double portion of provender. I know
a wcrnun of culture and refinement who last year declined several invitations
to homes of elegance in order to make a glad Thanksgiving feast for half a
dozen working girls. You may not be called upon to do that, but you
eight perhaps make a place at board for some needy, jkraely. one.
N o, you can't get up a first-class Thanksgiving dinner on the spur of the
moment, and you can't enter properly into the Thanksgiving spirit bv a sud
den spurt c: determination next Thursday morning. An article on Thanks
giving day, submitted to a magazine not long ago, contained this sentence:
"We are accustomed to reverence this day for his goodness which occurs but
once annually." Such a thought of the bounty of the Creator leads logi
cally to an expression of thanksgiving, "for this day only." Not so felt the
roble men who instituted this festival more than 225 years ago. "Having
ti;c c e many signs of God's favor and acceptances we thought it would be
great ingratitude if secrctlv we should smother up the same. And therefore
a solemn day was set apart wherein we returned glory, honor and praise."
thus speaks Governor Wtnslow of the Plymouth Colony, accounting for the
institution. It grew out of a spirit of appreciation and gratitude felt 365 days
in a vrar.

through whose laborious efforts and careful planning such
a ciraer has been made possible. In the old days in New Enzland when
Thanksgiving completely overshadowed Christmas the days before the event
ful Thursday were marked by a buzz of preparation that was felt by every
member cf the household, from grandmother down to the latest occupant

slaughter and dress the chickens, and on Monday morning the big stone
oven was warmed up. and from it for the next four days radiated appetizing
and tantalizing odors. As Eugene Field savs:

even crept into the church and produced a demand for a new voice in the
pulpit and for "modern methods." which term, by the way. covers a great
variety of new features, good, bad and indifferent, ranging from bright, at
tractive reading-rooms and gymnasiums to the somewhat questionable expe
dient of women ushers and a kind of vaudeville in the church parlors on
weekday evenings. As a nation we arc straining after the new. We mus:
beat yesterday's record somehow .or other. Our hotels must be a little more
gorgeous, our homes a little more palatial, our dishes a little more highly
spiced to-day than yesterday. .-Â¦Â¦''Â¦"Â¦-
To condemn utterly, this craving; would be absurd. It . means ia the
long run progress and a better civilization. But for the individual novelties
should be what condiments are to a feast. I know a : ' man whose firss
thought when he sits down to his meals is of pickles. Now that is not a
normal appetite. One ought to crave first of all good bread and butter,
meat and vegetables. -Then let the pickles and the other relishes come ia as
side dishes, not as the staole elements of the dinner.
One could not live without something to look forward to, but he ought
not to live entirely, upon his anticipations of the next frolic, the next out
ing, the next excitement The pleasures ahead of us â and let us hope they
are many for all of usâ are designed to exercise in advance a certain charm,
but woe be to the man who finds his chief zest not in what he has. but in
what he may have, not in what he is. but in what he is to be. not in what he
is doing, but in what he expects to be doing on some future day.
The external world, it is true, is continually renewing and renovating it
telf. "Chance and chancre are busv ever." Man's eternal instinct for some
thing different is recognized and provided for in the succession of the sea
sons and in the differing glories of summer and winter, of seedtime and har
vest. But the same skies bend over us that arched themselves above wan
dering Abraham and his herdsmen. The fields clothe themselves in new gar
ments from year to year, the trees take on the brilliant hues of fall.' bet the
process goes on according to a fashion which has prevailed from generation
to generation and the world is not more beautiful to-day than on the morn
ing of creation. i.
Let not then the thirst for the novel dominate you. Believe that there
is still something of value in the old ways, the old truths, the old virtues,
the old books, the old friendships. One who allows the thirst for the novel
to grow upon him loses the ioy he might have in hi3 present work, over
looks the cup of blessing right at hand and misses the real prizes of life. Â¦
THANKS WE DON'T GIVE
By the Parson.
Virility, or a viiforous manliness, is
a characteristic of the builders of our
nation. We do not always realize
that an important element in manli
ness is goodness. A manly thief or de
bauchee is an impossibility. Unim
peachable witnesses assure us that the
Pioneers, as well as the Pilgrims, were
a religious, church going people. Man
ly men to-day are following in their
footsteps and the best daily newspa-
ries : and present struggles lead us to
expect good results. The noble example
of our victorious predecessors has,
Â¦without doubt, lessened cowardice and
sloth in our land and so to-day in
spires us with a sure hope that brings
victories with it. We each one of us
have a war to wage with the lower self
and victory Is plainly possible, and
further, we may help others in their
conflict to victory. There are many
men whose lives are helping others.
One of these is Jacob Rlis, the suc
cessful warrior In the battle of the
slums inXew York City. Another Is
Booker Washington, the .champion who
is leading hosts of colored people to
larger and higher living. And Theo
dore Roosevelt, the intimate friend of
these two great men, exhibits the same
spirit, as he urges our nation to the
Btrenuous life of righteousness, which
means victory. Let us thank the god
of battles for the heroes df yesterday
and of to-day and of to-morrow. I am
aware of the fact that I have depart
ed from the usual custom of counting
at this season the blessings of the last
twelve months. I have felt that the
past, present, and future are so Inti
mately interwoven that our thanksgiv
ing must reach out from the glorious
present in both directions. The roots
of the "big trees" of our State reach
down deep underground and their
branches wave hundreds of feet above
the earth. Every year these trees add
one circle of new wood to the hundreds
telling the story of past years and each
circle Is larger than the preceding one.
Our State is growing In like manner:
reaching down into the dead past and
drawing life therefrom and reaching
high Into the realm of ideals and drink-
Ing in health and gladness. This year
California hfi-B added another circle to
her growth, and this yearfs circle is
the largest yet and tells of vast in
crease in wealth. In population, in rep
utation and, best of all, increase in
character and righteousness. Every
one of us may catalogue our mercies,
national and personal. The list will be
long for each of us: therefore we can
all unite on this glad day in Joyful
thanksgiving to God for his wonderful
goodness toward us. Gifts received
with true gratitude open up the way
for more and larger blessings. Let us
therefore with heartiest accord "praise
God, from whom all blessings flow."
This wedge-shaped letter V has in its
very form the promise of progress that
we feel when we see the sharp prow of
a swift vessel. Vision and virility point
to victory. Victory is a strong, glad
word â strong, for without struggle
there Is no victory; glad, for the
Joy of overcoming is the suprem
est happiness. The struggle for
existence has been fierce, and some
forms of animal life have ceased
to exist, but the better and more use
ful have been multiplied. Millions of
eheep replace the numerous wolves of
former days. However little we like
this process of elimination, we are
obliged to admit that the results are
good. Man, from the beginning, has
been forced to prove his right of exis
tence. He has won the victory over an
imals, though less in muscular power
than they. Man has fought against
man;, at first from the very lowest mo
tives, such as desire for revenge or for
booty. But if you study the wars of
history you will notice that more and
more a righteous motive, on at least
one side, has been the Impulse that led
to battle. The great wars of our coun
try have been struggles involving the
very highest moral Issues. Past victo-
pers give much apace . to religious In
terests. There were many bad men in
California in the -early days, but the
ruling spirits, represented by; the "Vig
ilance Committee," put themselves and
their State on record as agulnst un
righteousness.
In many ways these - heroes were
strong and to-day we offer our thanks
giving to their God and our God. . If
our present optimism Is justified. It
must be found to rest upon these same
foundations. And it Is true that good
ness, which is the harbinger of success,
is increasing In our land. Our last two
Presidents illustrate this tendency.
President McKlnley's dying reference
to the hymn, "Nearer, My God, to
Thee," invested those words with deep
er significance to multitudes, and every
week, in all parts of our country, this
doubly sacred hymn Is turning men's
hearts toward God. President Roose
velt's preachingâ yes, preachingâ of
righteousness has had a great Influence
upon our national life, and the good
ness of manliness and the manliness of
goodness are recognized and honored
to-day as never before. Read careful
ly the words of the Thanksgiving proc
lamation and note the strong religious
tone. I quote a part of this message
to the people: "It falls upon the Pres
ident to appoint a day of praise and
thanksgiving to God.
"During the last year the Lord has
dealt bountifully with us. â¢ â¢ â¢
"Therefore, in thanking God for the
mercies extended to us In the past, we
beseech him that he may not with
hold them in the future, and that our
hearts may be roused to war steadfast
ly for good and against all the forces of
evil, public and private. We pray for
strength and light, so that In the com
ing years we may with cleanliness,
fearlessness and wisdom do our allotted
work on the earth in such manner as to
chow that we are not altogether un
worthy of the blessings we have re
ceived." Such lives and words are In
spiring. For the strong, good men of
old and for worthy successors In
every station of life we render our
thanksgiving.
"Big" Rlley, the self constituted head
of the camp, looked on with amazement.
"Damn him!" he growled. "Why don't he
squeal?" Â¦
Slocum heard him. "Squeal! Me squeal!"
he exclaimed. "Why. this Is what I came
West for. Life has been a failure. Why.
partners. I want to die! I'm ready to quit.
You're the best friends I've struck in the
Territory. Do the job right and I'll be
satisfied." _^
"Big" Riley was stumped. The maverick
appreciated the situation. "Don't you
worry. Rlley," he said, kindly. "Get hold
of that rope and pull hard."
"I'll see you blasted first," yelled the
leader. "You're too easy, and you're too
damned mean to die. I'll not help you.
Boys, let's call this thing oft. Let's give
him a chance."
The "boys" were willing. Bennett re
possessed himself of the rope and then
turned to the maverick. ."You'd better
skip," he said. .
"No skip for me." replied , Slocum. "I
like 'white men' too well to leave them."
The camp tolerated Slocum. He' did
his share of the preliminary work inci
dental to the organization of the camp.
He was elected recorder and his conduct
was so exemplait' that he was appointed
agent of the express company that es
tablished an office there in the early days
of the boom. In time he became the cus
todian of the funds of the men who had
voted to .hang him. When the time was
riDe for the establishment of a church he
headed the subscription list. He presided
at public meetings and was sent to the
Territorial convention as the representa
tive of the political views of the camp.
He was a steadfast advocate of law and
order Cards never tempted him and
liquor rarely passed his lips. From the
despised maverick he was transformed
into a leading citizen. He was elected to
the Legislature, and his crowning glory
was his selection as a delegate from Ari
sona to the national convention of his
party When he returned from the East
ern city In which the- convention was held
be was accompanied by a bright-faced
and cheery young womanâ his wife.
The news of his marriage had preceded
him When the stage. In which he and
his bride were traveling from the rail
road to the camp, appeared at the head
of the gulch It was greeted with a volley
of lusty cheers- Anvils in which pow
der had been tamped roared a salute. The
camp's silver - cornet band played "8ee
the Conquering Hero Comes." The horses
were taken from the stage and a rope
was attached to the vehicle.; The bands
of a hundred enthusiastic admirers of the
former maverick seized the rope and at a
gallop hauled the stage to the hanging
tree. Beneath Its foliage, on an Impro
vised platform 81ocum stood and listened

only a few feet away the court of Judge
Lynch was still In session.
"If I only had one more chance," the
maverick muttered. "There Is a chance
and I'll take It," hÂ» finally said aloud,
and then his lips moved as If uttering a
prayer.
Two hours later Slocum was conducted
to the hanging tree. He was as reckless
as a war hero. He cursed his execution
ers and laughed In their solemn faces.
Bennett placed the greased noose about
his neck and adjusted it skillfully.

courage to a still better future, for the
years are surely bringing with them
better things.
We think to-day not only x>Z present
prosperity, but of the men who laid the
foundation for the great structure of
our national life. The Pi!rrim Fathers
of New England and the Pioneer Fath
ers of California, different as they were
in character, had many common traits,
such as love of liberty, dauntless deter
mination and especially the faculty of
looking forward with faith and hope
fulness. They were not satisfied with
the condition of affairs and they
lanced for a larger life. As a result
nf that dissatisfaction, coupled with a
capacity for work and the power to see
pr^at possibilities in the future, -we
ir.h^rit the glorious realities cf our
r-r^ent-day lives.
Every people that emerges from bar-
V'ariÂ«:n has before ft a %islon of better
things. A vision of better things camÂ»
:â¢ the founders of our nation and
State. We are grateful to God for the
vision of our fathers that has been so
largely realized in the magnificent
arhipvfmer.ts rf our nation and In the
gr!<">rious rrowth of our State.
Has this vision of better things
<-*-ased? Surely not. Californians are
believers in the future. If better
things are possible, we must make
them ours. ThiÂ« vision also will be
r^'Azsi. The church shares this op-
Tirr.ism. Her eyes pee the great work
thut :s h<=rs and her hands are ready
an-i ber h^art glad: and the vision of
righteousness which alone truly and
permanently exalts a nation is urging
her to larger efforts, for well she
knows there are no '"bolter things"
vlthotxt religion, which is Itself a vis
ion of God and duty and an enlistment
in his service.
There never has b?en an inventor
who ha? not had a vision of what his
Invention would be. But vision alone
does not accomplish much unless It
prompts to vigorous action. The In
ventor sees the possibility and then
Â¦works for it. Through years If neces
rary. through many failures he perse
veres, keeping the vision before him,
knowing that hiÂ« success Is not a mat
ter of chance. Xo one who tries to live
without working can be called manly.
The Pilgrims and the Pioneers were
rot shirker?, but workers. They were
men not afraid of any task. Deserts
and mountains and perils of land or
pea. instead of daunting their brave
hearts, added to their eagerness to
press on.

the while how things were going "on the
outside" and continually struggling with
an impatience at the way the world Is
made,- he worked, hard fortwo. years and
nine months to^get.a "goo* conduct" re
. durtion of his sentence. There remained
but a few. months more of. "confinement,
and they were to be the least irksome of
all, because- Harvey- had r climbed the
'heights -which "lead. to. the eminence of a
"trusty": he had become the errand boy
of the prisondoctor and was sent on com
missions to a"ll the different departments.

. "Next to what? l She ain't dead, is she?"
Detective Ackeray began his courtship
on a street corner and continued . it in a
station-house. He had deprived her of a
protector who did not protect; he wished
to provide her with another who would;
he had not hunted down Harvey out of
malice: it had been his business to work
up such evidence as there was and he had
done his business and got his reward,
and the prosecuting attorney, had done
the rest. These things he told her round
ly, with a manly straightforwardness that
should have touched the heart or the
imagination or fancy of- any woman.
When, instead of listening to him she re
viled.him with feminine finish, point and
fluency before a gathering crowd of.ehaf
llng auditors he proved himself a man to
be depended upon In an emergency, one
of the strong, dumb souls Carlyle and
Ruskln used to celebrate as natural lead

placed her under arrest as drunk and dis

sufficiently > demonstrated her disposition
to ; disorder by treating his : Honor

If Detective Ackeray. had been a mere
private citizen. and not a prince, or rather
a princeling, he must in mere decency "
have forborne for sonce time to -express
his admiration for Nettie Jeliffe. The
custom of an aristocracy is more direct;
the business of a prince and even, a
princeling requires haste, and their sub
stantial power ' makes haste possible.
Courtship in the given circumstances was
difficult, but courtship In the given cir
cumstances Js always difficult, and there
are no circumstances whatever in which
women have not been wooed and won.': 1 .'
"Lor.g-legged. leather-headed, front-of
fice stiff" Is* not a hackneyed term of en
dearment, and if Nettie Jeliffe had been
searching for a phrase by which to rec
ommend herself to Detective Ackeray's
esteem she might not have. hit upon K.
His taste, however, was mature and
sound. He did not mind hard words:
they do not lacerate the flesh. He mind
ed only bonnets and skirts with,feline
fiendish contents and it stands recorded
that whereas before Nettle Jeliffe had
ridiculed him he had pronounced her a
"clipper," after she had ridiculed him he
pronounced her emphatically a "corker."
No very definite Ideas are attached- to
either of these words, but they both ex
press admiration, and, "corker" is more
nearly extreme than "clipper."
Later Ackeray was heard to say, "That
little woman is too good for Jeliffe," and
to declare that he would do her a good
turn some time if he saw his wayi He
was not a man to split hairs. about what
he thought a good turn and what she
would think a good turn; it. she did not
know what was good for her, he did; it
vras not good for her to be beaten. When
he arrested Harvey "on suspicion" In
connection with the housebreaklng in
RIshworth place she cried more bitterly
than at any time when she had received
a beatingâ ehe took her beatings â¢ f pr the
most part in haughty silence. "When he
Detective Ackeray was not hurt by the
frankness of Nettie Jellffe's speech;
neither did he find that it lessened her
"ladyship." On the contrary, he was old
fashioned enough to think a generous lie
a grace in womanhood and that a family
quarrel Js a sacred function so long as
the family stands ready to present a
united front against the intervention of
an outsider. -
"You jis* try to pinch my Harvey," she'
went on. "W'y, you long-legged, leather
headed, front-office stiff, I'd rather ,have
my Harvey kick me reg'Iar every morn-^
ing than drink a bottle o' sham with you
every night. You go home an* see 'f,
your own wife don't need a little troun
cin\"
The discipline was b*ing given in the
street, and Ackeray would not have been
a "fly" co? had he not believed it to be
his right to take a hand in all strc-t hap
penings. 'Harvey believed it to bo his
right to administer any chastisement that
he thought* his 'v/lfe needed wherever it
proved most -convenient. - - -
"This '.s my circus," he said defiantly
when Ackeray threatened to "pinch" him.
"You rubber too much with y'r neck, you
do. If you can't do anythin' bettor than
mix yourself in family affair?, why, I'll
help you to get 1 over the habit."
"I tell you those, too," Nettle declared;
boldly chamnloning her husband's right to
bring her up according to his best light,
"if you fly cops 'ud take care o* your own
fam'lies the way you try to take care of
other people's, you'd save more money.
You're an old woman, that's what you
are. I wouldn't be found dead llvln' with
you."
"Sock it to him!" "Hit him where . he
liven!" "Kick him out o* the street!" by-,
standers suggested, and Nettie was em
boldened to continue her "roasting."
Â«lld that which seemed o!e:isant In
bis own eyes, and what his heart lusted
for be took and kept with, a strung hand.
In particular his heart had lusted tor Net
tle IUx and he had taken her trom her
father and her brothers by dint of his
strong hand In their faces In what the
neighborhood called a "mix-up," which
occurred when he proposed for her.
To be cure his proposition was some
what sudden and was not couched in ac
cents that could in the least be celled typ
ical of the lover'* whining, wheedling def
erence toward the guardian dracrons of
his beloved. He had said with Homeric
simplicity, after having listened to the
family pretest against their main wage
earner being removed:
"You can stow that gas for nil me. Not
an* me Is goin* to tilt rlslit now. If >'.
ain't dead set on bein' sorry to part with
her y* can git away from that dcor. If
>' don't git away I'll walk trough y*.
and it might deregulate y'er msides."
It was then that the "mix-un" occurred.
Harvey "walked t'roush" Nettle's male
kinsmen, at all events, greatly to the dis

Detective Ackeray was not given to
what the young lady novelists would call
assorted sentiment. He had heard mem
bers of the officially gentler sex cry out
Insults, to which nothing but a good drub

one; and had seen women tantalize a man
to deal the blow which would dishonor
him. until from the point of view of a

act like a lady don't deserve to be treated
like a lady," he had once been heard to
declare between his teeth as he bundled
a bonnet and skirt, etc., roughly Into a
patrol wagon. To be sure, the exaspera
tion had bet-n extreme. The bonnet and
Ekirt had behaved more a3 if they con
tained a large number of the cat species
than a woman, and one side of Detective
Ackeray's face had been laid open in
broad bands from eye to chin. The point
is. however, that Nettie Jeliffe did act
like a lady, according to Detective Acker

It is the first step that counts. From
a general survey Miss Hastings descend

books, and inspected the Japanese ivories
in a cabinet on the. wall. Then, having
Imbrued one finger, as it were, and noth

no reason why she should not; d'p In her
whole hand. Besides, if Graham should

."He wouldn't. care at my looking at his,

And Graham agreed.
"It would take a lifetime."
"I don't think I'd mind so very much

"The mouth !Â¦ wrong, you said, and

"You might correct it."
"Destroy itâ or rather let you, for I
can't. You see my whole heart and skill
have gone Into it. All my dreams, and
hopes, and ideals â and I can't." He
handed the knife to her.
She took it. but did not use it "I don't
know how," she said, "and I don't think
I want to. Can't I have it? It's my pic

"Why â any one can see it is. It's hard
ly brave of you to try to get out of It
that way. It's just Ilka me."
"It is a beautiful face."
"I didn't mean that." she cried hotly,
"and if it is. you had no right to make
me beautiful, nor to give me those
thingsâ or to paint me at all."
"I suppose I hadn*t." Graham reached
about for a palette knife and found It.
"What are you goins to do?" asked
Mabel faintly. ,> ::â¢/Â¦
She deigned no answer. "Isn't It usual
to ask the sitter's permission before
painting them?" she said coldly.
1 "How do you know it is you?"
Mabel jumped, and felt the blood surg.

ON THE TRAIL
OF A MALTESE
It has beÂ»n remarked in the first part
of .this tale that Harvey Jeliffe, on be
coming a penitent in the great peni
tentiary, had no notion or Intention of
ever ; bidding /for' the notoriety that has
come to him in later years as the Prison
Demon. He went to the Stir originally
with the idea of getting all the "good
time" that the law allows a man who
baa bew sentenced to four years and
â¢f keeping; oat of all rows, as his wife
bad adrlMML Be did that which all wise
Thre.e months afterward she was legally
and_ absolutely separated . from Harvey
and* was married to a man whom she ad
dressed sometimes as "George," sometimes
as "dear," and little Blanche, who was
restored to hÂ£r home, was outspoken' in
her approval of her new papa. "Detective
Ackeray â¢ was "George." He was also

at the instigation of Detective Ackeray.

They're married."

convention was broken off- It had been
successful, however: Harvey wa^
"news." and he had got Ther-^were
other trips to the. glove department to se
cure the details of the story by word or
mouth, but . his own j lmagin ttloa had
patched them together for Â«">Â»Â»""
had learned the main fact, which was
that Ackeray "had done him dirt. Tne
unmerited conviction and imprisonment
became for him now part of a general
scheme to "ditch" him.' The Injustice of
the punishment had troubled him and
"made it hard to obey the rules, but he naa
conquered/ the temptation to be unruly. He
had been puzzled by Nettle's refusal to
write, but he had not -connected Ackeray
with her neglect of him.
In ah indefinite way he had planned
Feme day to settle accounts with Ackeray
â¢'for 'the part he had played in his (Har
vey's) misfortunes, but, the thought of
ways and means had not captured bis
mind; that could be attended to after he
had secured his reduction of sentence.
Had he been "outside" even the news of
Ackeray's -theft of his wife and child
might possibly have been as â¢ reasonably
considered as had been the conviction that
he "â¢was" unjustly a prisoner. Men of Har
vey's stamp are much calmer in the open
than In the Stir, and marriages and
divorces take on- no such final propor
tions. . It had taken all of Harvey's good
sense, however, to be a model 'penitent,
and the .complete revelation of Ackeray s
duplicity fired him with. a, desire for re
venge. Henceforth his one passion was
to meet Ackeray. He still remained a
"trusty": good behavior had become au
tomatic with him: but his ambition was
no longer simply to be released. He spoke
to the warden and the guard3 of his wish
to have a talk with Ackeray. He said
thoÂ» there '- was a suspended sentence
hanging over him in another court, and
he wanted to know if Ackeray would be
willing "to fix things up for him."
"He's the ' .ly fellow that can straight
en the matter out." he explained to the
"warden, "and I want to have a talk with
him."
"You're afraid you'll be arrested on bÂ»*
Ing turned loose from here, la that ltr*
asked the warden.
"That's exactly It," eald Harvey, "and
I thlnic If Ackeray '11 go to the front for
me I won't be bothered."
"All right. Ackeray's goln' to brine 10ms
prisoners here In a day or so. an' I'll let
him know."
Three days later Detective Ackeray ar
rived at the great penitentiary with
a batch of penitents, for whose body he
was given a receipt by the warden. He
was Informed of Harvey's desire for a
talk with htm and was Immediately Im
pressed with the Importance to himself
of such a talk. Possibly he might find
It to his advantage to arrange matters so
that the alleged suspended sentence
should bÂ« carried out.
"Sure. I'll see htm." he said to the
warden. "Where la he T*
"You'll probably find him over la the
doctor's office. Take him Into the gar
den if you want to be private and tell the
doctor I said it would be all right."
The meeting took place in the doctor's
office. The doctor was In another part of
the prison and Harvey had been left in
charge. No one heard the conversation
between the two men. and only two of
the guards knew anything about their
being together. Whether Harvey made
v*e of his "suspended sentence" story or
charged Ackeray Immediately with foul
treatment of him has never been decided.
The two men were In conference, accord-
Ing to the testimony of the guards, about
half an hour, and it seems reasonable to
suppose that Harvey could only have In
terested Ackeray this length of time by
reference to the suspended sentence, but
In view of what happened one is Justlfled
In wondering why he should have wanted
to interest him at alL Harvey himself
ha3 persistently refused to make any
statement one way or the other. When
the doctor returned to his ofilce Harvey
Â¦was found sitting in a pool of blood oa
the floor, cutting into small bits with a
surgeon's knife the heart of Detective
Ackeray. who lay dead and mutilated la
ft, corner of the room.
At the trial it was reported that Har
vey had mumbled to himself as he cut.
"So much for so much: for that and for
that." but no intelligible interpretation of
these expressions could be discovered, and
they were eventually accepted as contrib
utory evidence of hia insanity.

THE DEMON
OF THE PRISON
8Sunday Call
Women and Children's Sectionsmooth floor, no insects, ' no crackling
leaves, no dirt. What Is that?"
It was the odd, whinnying call of a loon.
Suzette heard It end smiled. Jean was
down there by the river waiting for her.
He had adopted that call when they were
children together nearly ten years before,
because Jean had said he was always a
loon when in her presence. '".-â¢'.",".
For a moment a troubled look came to
her face. She did not like to disappoint
Jean, or to keep him waiting: he was
such a good fellow. Then the trouble left
her eyes, and she" was again Â«smlltag. Jean
did not know anything about Paris, and
what was more he did not care to learn.
So an hour went by before' monsieur
rose gracefully from the stone upon
which they had' b*en slttlnr. *nd >*"&
many flourishes excused himself and went
tripping daintily and -disdainfully over
the crackling leaves' toward his boarding
place. Suz.ettÂ« watched him thoughtfully
until he was out of sight, then roÂ«e and
walked down to the rlvtr.
Jean was waiting for her, as she knew
he would - be, lying upon the bank and
gazing ; rather moodily into the water.
But at her t approach he was instanCy
upon bis feet,' smiling again and happy.
"You were with monsljeur?", he

"The people we hire do, but not us. We
put our hands Into our pockets and take
out silver and give lt to them, and they
do everything." Â¦
Suzette shook her head skeptically.
"That is extravagant, monsieur," she
rebuked.' "It Is cheaper to work than to
hire. I know that We never hire unless
we have more work than wa can do our
selves."
Her chin dropped upon her hand end
she gazed out among the great Canadian
pines, her thoughts in her eyes.
"Beautiful, beautiful," she murmured.
"Oh, I should like to see your chateau,
monsieur, and Paris glittering at night,
and the boulevards and automobile end
all. I do not understand how you could
leave so much." Â¦ .
Monsieur hesitated a little, then swung
his hand In a wide Imaginary circle.
"It was my people," he said. "They
thought lt best for me toâ to go away a
little while. They wanted me to see the

"Yes, plenty," agreed Suzette absently.
"Yes, he talked about such beautiful
things. Oh, Jean, I would like to see that

. "It is not more beautiful than this,"
said Jean, sweeping his hand along the
broad course of the river, with Its wind
ing banks. "But never mind Paris and
the river Just now. I have something else
to say. My cabin Is finished," looking, at
her with joyous eyes. "I hung the last
door this morning."
"Isn't that nice?" rather listlessly. She
was thinking of Paris. ;
."But look et your own," cried monsieur
diasrcatefily, "you're muddy to tha kssea."
.Suzette was about to follow, but Jean
was by her side, and- in a perfectly nat
ural, matter-of-fact way he lifted her In
his arms and carried her to the firm
ground beyond.
"There you are," he said cheerily, "with
not as much as a splatter of mud on your
shoes."
Ingly. He was the first man to Join Su
zette, and monsieur the second; If either
left it must be monsieur. So the three
walked on together.
Deeper and more shadowy the path be
came, and at length they arrived at a de
pression which had been a brook not so
very long before, but which had now dried
to three or four yards wide of soft mud.
Monsieur looked at It discontentedly.
"We will have to mire through, I
suppose," he grumbled. "That's the
trouble with this abominable country,
you're always running up against things
like this. We must walk as carefully as
we can, ma belle. Perhaps you can fol

to get as little as possible upon his shoes.

dress in distinctive colors, ribbon an
trwers beautifully as a substitute, and
about the awellest yet easiest thing to
fashion Is a great soft bow that Is set in
the mM/\\* of thÂ© board. Of course, the
ribbon should be broad, and It makes a
much richer appearance If it is of satin,
as the luster adds its mite V> the splen
dor. To be sure, it would droop In a
very foolish fashion If tiny covered wires
were not run through it and then It may
be bent la any shape that pleases one's
fancy the most.
A deep yellow or a rich red are the
best colors to utilize- In this way, as they
ara stronger tones and make much more
of an impression than a dainty blue or a
pale lavender, or even white, for one of
the main things about this fad is the sur
prise and the pleasure that it Is always
certain to give on entering the room.

when the froth Is dropped, by spoonfuls
And then comes the part of thinking
out how each courBe shall be cooked and
served and in thJs manner Is shown the
originality of the hostess. While all din
ners may be good they may also be dead
ly commonplace, and no one particularly
cares to sit down to an ordinary every
day meal that might be prepared quite
as well In their own apartments.
For instance, clam cocktails are more
of a novelty than oyster cocktails, and
they are quite as easy to make. Open
about Eix little neck clams and drop them
with their juice, into a cocktail class
Then mix a little lemon juice a tea
epoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a drop
or eo of tabasco eauce and 6ervel
Some people like horseradish with oys
ters or clams, and It is as well to add a
teaspoonful on the side and they may
do as they like best concerning it. And
in thÂ« matter of bread and crackers it
Is the same. Now and then lettuce sand
wiches are served, but the crisp water
crackers are more dainty and not quite
as filling, and that should be taken Into
consideration when there are eoma eight
or nine courses to follow.
Never permit a dinner to extend over
two hours for that is as much time as
the majority of people care to sit at the
table, although with the changing of seats
every fifteen minutes cr eo some little
time is merrily wasted' and the guests
have an opportunity to move about freely
and eo in a measure rest themselves.
.There is one drawback to this novel
dinner" and In many instances ft iV a
most serious one. Instead of:two maids,
and they can serve ten or twelve people
nicely, one is needed for every room, un
less the hostess Is clever enough to time
the courses so that one table may be
t-ating: while the other is bÂ«;ng served.
But this is most difficult to successfully
accomplish and unless one fcas a splen
didly trained butler or maid one would
better not try it, for the least anxiety or
show of flurry always affects the guests
and their spirits are dampened accord
ingly.
What one eats certainly has a great
deal to do with the joys of an evening,
hut the entertaining talker or the clever
story teller is quite as necessary, aifd the
hostess who would make an enviable
name for herself will soon find out that
they are quite as indispensable as appe
tizing food.
The progressive dinner is not nearly as
formal an affair as the regulation one,
and no hostess need give the details such
an amount of worrying or fretting over,
although the manner of serving and the
assigning of guests to their places should
never be neglected for a single instant.

as a very uncomfortable one, and there
Is great danger of soiling both the linen

to simmer down use tnat. for It turns thÂ»
turkey a beautiful, tempting brown. I
There Is always one caution about roast
ing fowl of any kind, and that Is don"t
let It dry up. When the b!rd begins to
brown too much on one side turn It over
and keep on turning and basting, and if
It eeems to be cooking too fast, cover It
with a big pan so that the heat may not
cook it so fast. Then It will retain aU Its
juice and be moist and delicious.
Bread and butter dressing Is bo simple
that any one could make It, but glblet
sauce Is more complicated and requires
more skllL In the first place, pour oft
the liquid In which the turkey was roast
ed and skim oft six tablespoonfuls of fat.
Then put the fat back In the pan and
stir in as many tablespoonfuls of flour.
"When this is smooth gradually pour oa
three cups of stock In which the giblets
have been cooked. The rest Is simple.
Cook about five minutes, season with salt
and pepper and strain. The giblets them
selves may be added, chopped up la tiny
bits, but they thicken tha gravy and
seem to give the idea "of more meat, so
it Is quite as well to leave them out.
Quail Is cooked much like turkey. Inas
much as It 13 rubbed with butter, sprink^
led with salt and pepper and well covered
with flour. But tha length of cooking Is
vastly different. Where one takes three
hours .the other requires at most not
more than fifteen minutes, and small ones
do not need more than ten.
They are especially appetizing when
served en toasted bread on a bed of crisp
lettuce, for then the garnishlngs add so
much that they look as though they
would fairly melt In thÂ© mouth and. of
a truth, when they are cooked and served
properly are a dlsb fit to set before a
king.
Iced tociatoes ara a tempting dish and
one that Is very easy to concoct. First
of all. firm tomatoes must be cnosen and
then dipped In hot water for a minute so
that the peel will slip off without break
ing or marring their roundness. The cen
ter Is scooped out and they are put on
Ice to freeze. Then comes tha dressing
part. Take- as many shrimps as you
deem necessary and shell them carefully
In order to get as much meat from them
as possible. To this is added a regular
mayonnaise dressing, a little salt and a
dash of red pepper. Just before serving
the shrimps, well mixed with the dress
ing, are put into the tomatoes and the
whole set on a green lettuce bed and
given a yellow top of mayonnaise.
This sort of salad Is one of the richest
that may be had. for it Is refreshing endU
not as filling as chicken or crab salad
must necessarily be and It Is delightfully
cocl.
There is scarcely any reason why on*
should go to the trouble of having pud
ding made In the home when all that Is
necessary is to order It from tha gro
cery and have it delivered quite as deli
cious as It could be made by a first-class
chef. And It is practically the same with
mince, squash and lemon pies. These
days there are bakers who make a spe
cialty of mincemeats and holiday pies,
and when they put forth their best efforts
it takes more" than an ordinary cook to
turn out anything better, or half as good.
Almond cracklings are something new
and are good to top off with, as It were,
Take four tablespoonfuls of blanched al
monds and split them in fourths, two
ounces almond paste, three ounces of
powdered sugar, a few grains of cloves
and the white of one egg to moisten the
whole to the consistency of soft dough.
Work all together, using a spoon for
mixing In order not to heat the sugar
with the warmth of the hands. When it /
is about the right consistency drop from '
the tip of a spoon and bake far fifteen or
twenty minutes In a slow fire. After they
have been pressed down with the W?"1ff
of a knife they are flat and white, bat
when ready to eat are a delicate brown
that Is mest tempting.
Fruit makes a pretty centerpiece ami
really that is about all It Is there fjn,
for scarcely cne person In ten cares i4L
it after doing justice to the various other
good things. But the coffee tones down.
and when it is followed with peach bran
dy or some equally good Iicr-zenx life holds
no other bliss and It's a happy, happy
world until the next day.
Oysters may be served raw or cooked,
for they are tremendously popular either
way. II the cooking means anything la
the kitchen It Is better to garnish them
with bits of parsley and leidbn and let
them be brought on frozen, but. If on the
v other hand, the kitchen â¢ Is serene, they
are ever so much nicer scalloped.
I A good recipe Is to mix one-half cup
each of stale bread and cracker crumbs
and stir In one-half cup of melted butter.
Put a thin layer of the buttered crumbs
In the bottom of the bread box, that has
been hollowed out before, then a layer of
oysters, well sprinkled with pepper and a
alight grating of lemon peel. Then add
two tablespoonfuls of oyster liquor and
one of cream. After that It Is but a mat
ter of repeating the Ingredients until the
bos Is well filled, being careful to have
the buttered crumbs on top. To make It
Just right It should be cooked full twenty
flve minutes and served while piping hot.
There are many ways of garnishing
such a dish, but inost of them are a great

purpose.
But tha feature of the skirt is its em
broidery. A very profuse and very elab
orate design in wheat ears is worked upon
the gown in such a way that the design
runs all the way around the skirt. There
is a trimming of wheat oetween tha rows
of ribbon, and at tha head of tha ribbon
there Is a very wide, very elaborate em
broidery of wheat. â¢â¢;
The same design Is seen on the sleeves.
The cuffs are deep and are funnel shaped
and embroidered with wheat heads. Above
the cuffs there ara great melon shaped
pieces gathered at the back to form a
very full sleeve. The sleeve Is banded
with two-Inch wide rows of ribbon.
The top of the sleeve is a mass of tuck-
Ing and embroidery and the embroidery
extends over the shoulder cap and up on
the shoulder and yoke.
The waist Itself, too, Is a symphony In
harvest home ooiors, for, upon tha waist,
which Is a pale brown, there are em
broidered wheat stems and wheat heads
In shaded colors, changing from tha deep
er shades of yellow to tha paler ones.
A touch of scarlet is an excellent thing
In the Thanksgiving dinner gown. Thera
are very elaborate little scarlet â¢ stocks
and there are handsome Persian neck and
wrist bands.' Coral beads are very showy
upon a house dress and great strands of
coral hang from the neck right. down to
the belt. Knots of scarlet ribbon adorn
the throat and a great many stocks have
knots of scarlet ribbon at the back of the
neck as well as under the chin, in fact,
the little : ribbon chou plays a very â¢ Im
portant part in the house dress, changing
it, coloring It, subduing it and bringing it
Into harmony with whatever color scheme
may be desired. X ,
The New Bibbon Trimmings.
The extent to which the modistes are
carrying ribbon trimming cannot be fully
understood by the ona who has not made
a study of the subject.
Ribbon Is used for belting which ter
minates In a fat little chou;. and from
this chou Is carried a little loop of rib
bon up to another chou, and another loop
connects it with another chou further up
on the waist, until the whole terminates
In a very neat little ribbon ornament fat
the side of tha collar.
Then ribbon Is used as a band trim
ming and Is put on, not as a ruffle, nor a
a flat band sewed, upon each edge, but
It Is attached along tha upper edge and
is trimmed with a strange little fagot
pattern. Fagoting Is very fashionable,
used as the heading for a band of rib
bon; â¢ and some of the prettiest ribbon
trimmings are doubled, sewed along the
upper edge and handsomely fagotted.'

The application of flowers to a gown Is
not at all difficult and. If carefully cut
out of the velvet, there will be no frayed

of the flower. These bunches, or the sin

of black velvet. These were in clusters
upon the waist and were scattered over
the skirt. Single forget-me-nots dropped

flounce there was a little ruffle of the net.
The waist was tight fitted, with only the
very slightest shirtwaist tendencies. The
yoke was ruffled with very narrow ruf

finished with net ruffles, while a ruffle of
net went down the back of the arm, fol
lowing the seam.

A lovely gown is a dress which Is built
In the harvest home tones. The skirt,
which is In pale brown veiling, or in
something a little heavier, Is made with
a skirt which Is slightly sweep length,
neither too short nor too long. It is trim

tertaining her near friends, can give her-
Belf more leeway. She can choose any
of the soft tones that are well known to
be appropriate for the house and can

A Harvest Home Gown.
The instep skirt is a feature of the res
taurant guwn, as well us of the street
diess. and is also worn for the evening
and for the nicest of occasions. No more
is it preserved for the rainy day skirts
and the trotting costumes, but it will
be brought out on Thanksgiving days, at
the Thanksgiving dances and Thanksgiv
ing dinners, formal and informal.
For the matron who gives a dinner at
home there are gowns that are ideal,
neither too showy nor too plain. And in
this matter the hostess must be- her own
best judge, for she knows her guests and
she must be sure that she never over
dresses nor Is yet too conspicuously plain.
Many New York hostesses adopt the
plan of dressing either in white or in
black; and many draw a still finer line.
The black gown is chosen for day occa
sions at home, when they are to act the
part of hostess, and the white gown for
evening.
A great many evening dresses are cut
in instep length and very pretty they are
and very convenient. Coming just to the
instep, they show the high heeis that are
worn with the dinner gown and the very
graceful arch of the foot. Indeed, it is
due to her vanity and the pretty shoes
of the season that woman wears the in
step skirt.
Queen A.eacandra. who is not necessarily
an extravagant dresser just because sha
is a queen, wore not long ago a black
net trimmed with bands of black satin
ribbon over a dress of black and white
striped silk. The skirt was instep length
and the waist was cut on the shirt waist
plan.
And net has the advantage of variety,
for it can be worn over different colors
and always assumes a new appearance
over its new lining.
Net. while not a substantial goods,
wears very nicely and if of fairly good
quality is highly to be advised for a din
ner gown or for a gown for informal oc
casions. It is much more durable than
it looks, will stand a deal of- wear and
tear without looking shabby and can be
turned, made over and made up in such
a variety of ways that it turns out to be

more than that, are desirable, for the
gown depends upon its color for its beau
ty. Pearl pray and geranium make a
beautiful combination; so also do navy

the leaves are a soft, velvety, grassy
green, while the gown itself is a deep.

The tulle vest front, with loops and ends

the little tulle rosettes that are now em
ployed to trim gowns of veiling, gowns of
other house stuffs, and gowns of lace, are

shell. The bows and ends were arranged

throat there was a big pink brooch.
Tulle at the back of the neck has be
come a standby of fashion and the tulla
chou. fastening Just at*the nape of the
neck. Is both becoming and necessary In
-certain cases. It fills a gap created by
the high coiffure and lends a soft becom
ingness to the long thin ;, neck which
could not be supplied In positively any
other manner.
The Uses of Tulle.
A gflwn which will be worn Thanksgiv
ing night is made of lace, put together In
very wide strips, tully a third of a yard
in width. These strips are connected with
a network of narrow white velvet ribbon.
This network is interwoven and Interlaced
until it makes a very respectable lattice.
The lace gown should not be a gathered
affair, for the gathers destroy the beauty
and the design of the lace. On the con
trary, it should be extremely plain and
should be litted to the hips and around
the figure, and should be continued in one
long, unbroken line to the end of tha
train. It is hardly possible to make the
lace gown too tight fitting.
The foot of the skirt can be trimmed
with a very deep flounce, and the flounce
can be put on in such a manner that it
lengthens the skirt and looks like a part
of it. instead of serving as a flounce.
The Thanksgiving hostess can do a
great deal with tulle for the full virtues
of this material, as an accessory of dress
and as an ornament, have never been so
fully exploited as now. Take a large
double chou of tulle and fasten It upon
the front of the bodice, drawing it out so
that It reaches from the neck very nearly
to the belt, and a very nice vest-like ef
fect Is created.
For such dinners as are given Thanks
giving evening by the fashionable set
there are marvelous gowns in lace, abun
dantly trimmed with ribbon. The lace,
which Is not of an expensive sort, has Its
pattern supplemented with a ribbon swirL
which is carried all over the gown,
making a very decorative piece of work,
that is at first puzzling, for It does not
show what it la upon it3 face.
Another shows a stiffening of crinoline;
another sleeve is stiffened with a silk In
terlining, which holds it out sharply In
place. The day of the saggy, baggy sleeve
puff has gone out and has been succeeded
by the sleeve puff which Is fully stiffened.
In the Fashionable World.
The grfat and particular feature of tha
fullness Is the manner In which It Is ituff
ed out, for it no longer falls flat and baggy
below the hand. On the contrary. It sets
out in very smart shape, and to keep its
fullness there are employed all sorts of de
vices, one of which is that of stuffing the
fullness with tissue paper after the sleeve
is on.
wherever there is a nice gown. The sleeve
shows the fullness below the elbow, for
it swells out in a great melon-shaped puff.
But the fullness, instead of sagging. Is
so arranged that it bags out in a great
puffy shape, which is sometimes gathered
Into the cuff and sometimes laid In folds.
All the fullness 13 at the back of tha
sleeve, and the fuller it Is the better from
fashion's standpoint.
Tha Thanksgiving hostess can wear
many new features of dress, and ona of
her available novelties Is noticed In tha
lace paneling with which her dress can
be trimmed. Very narrow lace, running
from half an inch to two Inches in width,
can bÂ« extended up and down the skirt
in such a manner as to cover the seams.
There can bÂ« half a dozen panels, or a
dozen, according to the gown.
It Is an era In the fashion 'world when
a great deal of work Is put upon a gown,
not alone when it is being made, but
all during its career. Many handsome
dresses are built in such a manner that
they must be sewed up the back each
time they are put on, for it is now fash
ionable to conceal the opening In tha
w .ist. And the sown can be made to
fasten Invisibly only in tms manner.
The Thanksgiving hostess. If sha wotud
be dressed smartly, must ba wllllag te
go to some trouble,
The sleeves, which are long, are sewed
Into the shoulder seam and are not re
movable. But the yoke can be slipped
out and the vest comes out with It. This
creates a low necked evening gown at
once. When desired tha vest and yoks
can be put back in and the result Is a
day gown, suitable for dinner In the mid
dle of the day If necessary or for any
house occasion by day.
The square evening neck Is another of
the new thine* of the season, for It la a
neck that Is built, not In tha old. conven
tional fashion, but In a decidedly novel
manner, for It is simply cut squara at tha
throat and high over the shoulders and
semi-low In the back of tha neck.
Indeed, so modified is this squara neck
that it cannot be called a low neck at all,
but a neck that is squared out. and as
such It can be worn Just as well for day
as for evening-. A great many of thesa
necks are built entirely for day cowej
and are to be put on when tha sun shines
as well as when It has cone to rest.
This wearing of tha low neck Is a n*w
feature and Is another of* the revivals of
the year. Fifty years ago It was no nov
elty to see an afternoon dress with low
neck, or with the rounded throat. And
again that style has coma In. It Is In to
a greater extent than one would Imagine,
and a great many hostesses are building
their house dresses with necks that are
either prettily curved In round fashion or
are cut down almost to the "salt cellars"
of the neck. Of course, none are decid
edly decollete, but are more on tha
rounding type, or the squara type, cut
away so as to reveal the throat prettily.
And why should not tha gowns be cut
away In this fashion? Thera Is no reason
why the neck should be covered any
more than the face or hands; and tha
new gowns that expose tha throat are
pretty, sensible, becoming and certainly
on the order of novelty, and novelty Is
what every one seeks.
Tha woman who knows anything at all
about economy will so arrange her din
ner town that It can be worn either for
day occasions or for evening. The French

popular men in Ireland At the time of the death of the great Irish
leader Chafes Stewart Parneil, when the ranks of the Irish National party
were torn by dissension, a prominent member of the party said: "What a pity
we did not catch Plunkett young enough. He is the only man fit to succeed
Parne:i." Parneli. although up to his neck in the fight for the political re
generation of his country, was thoroughly practical in his conception o, what
his country most needed. He had his eyes fixed on certain regions and in
dustries of Ireland, the development of which into activity and prosperity
only needed the fostering hand of capital and enterprise He spent a large
portion of his fortune in prospecting and developing mining industries on his
estates in the County Wicklow. He declared himself in favor of a protective

Sir Horace Plunkett, unencumbered by political cares and troubles, is de

be the "man for Gal way" in a political sense, for he was defeated there at an
election for Member of Parliament by Colonel Lynch of Boer war fame. The
patriots of Galway. of course, elected the man who cast his fortunes with the

Lynch's election void on the ground of his being guilty df high treason,
Plunkett refused to accept the vacant seat to which he was legally entitled.
Sir Horace Plunkett spent some years of his life in America. There he
learned valuable lessons of enterprise, go-aheadness and "no such word as
fail." He returned to Ireland with the full .determination of doing all in his
power to train his countrymen on the Yankee system. He saw, as Mr. Par
nell saw, that the immensely preponderating agricultural class of Ireland was
the one to be reckoned with in the building up of the country on a second
economic basis, and he laid his plans accordingly. Irish manufactures
which flourished in several parts of Ireland in the eighteenth century were
crushed out of existence by British policy. At a time when English manu
facture was very hard pressed by Irish competition in textile fabrics, an ad
dress praying for relief was presented to King William III by his faithful
Lords and Commons. He replied, "I will do all in my power to discourage
woolen manufacture in Ireland" He kept his word and many of his suc
cessors followed his policy. As a result the people were forced to eke out a
miserable existence as tillers of the soil owned by an absentee landlord
class who exacted from them the last pound of flesh with more than Shy-
Jock greed. For generations Ireland has been sending masses of her people
across the Atlantic to find new homes under the shelter of the* Stars and
Stripes. To-day the population of Ireland is less than half what it was. in
the days of Daniel O'Connell â a little over fifty years ago.
Sir Horace Plunkett, with characteristic grit and sympathy, set to work
to stop this tide of emigration, which was sapping away the life blood of the
country. He said one of the greatest obstacles in his path was "the spirit of
despondency which broods over our people, taking the form of a belief that
under existing circumstances nothing can be done." His grand idea to bring
them out of this slough of despond is co-operation. To get them out of
themselves and bring them together in order to confer as to what was to be
done and how they should set about it was his great task. An organization
called the Agricultural Organization Society was started in Dublin, which
was mdoTved liberally by the Government. Sir Horace Plunkett was elected
president) and as members there are Orangemen from the North. United
i's'i Leaguers from the west and south and men of all shades of politics
.-.â¢â¢ft region from all sections of the country. His very soul revolts at the
f.V- wrought by religious dissension in Ireland, '"breaking one another's
Keaf!Â« for the love of God." Addressing a meeting of Orangemen in Belfast,
he *r.H facetiously: "We all know that those who differ from us in matters
r" re'igintr trill ?Â»c adequately punished hereafter. So why harbor bad feel
i-i?- r.nn? Let us shake hands and let the poor Papists alone for the pres
ent." Through the representatives or agents of this Agricultural Organiza
tion Fociety farmers and farm laborers are shown how to organize their in
dr.ftrieÂ« upon business principles. So rapid has been the progress made that
thrre nr^iow over 700 co-operative associations organized and affiliated with
the central s ociety in Dublin, which have enrolled as members about 75.000
feftners. Through the central society they can purchase slock ana all tne
materials required in their several industries at the very lowest market rates.
These co-operative associations build and equip creameries, where butter and
cheese of excellent quality are manufactured. .They engage in poultry farm
ing, bee keeping, fruit growing, blooded stock breeding and other lines suited
to an agricultural people, all on the co-operative system. Many of these co
operative associations are developing industries which chiefly afford employ
ment to the female members of the family, such a* lace making, crochet,
embroidery, hosiery,, rug making, fancy. basket making, etc. Sir Horace
Plunkett's motto is to render "help to self help," and with that object' in
view he has shown the people how to start and operate co-operative banks.
Within a dozen years over 100 of these banks have been organized, which
give cheap credit through mutual security. The farmer who procures a loan
is expected to repay it at a very low rate of interest when he dispose* of his
crop or stock. So far not a penny has been lost by these banks. A car
driver at a place called Belmullet said to an important personage who had
hired him, "You could oblige me, sir, if you would hurry up, as there's a bank
meeting to-night, and as I am a director they will fine me if I do not attend."
So favorably impressed with the good work being done by Sir Horace Plun
kett was the great lawyer and orator, Bourke pockran of New York, that he
placed $50,000 in his hands, which was at once inverted in a milling enterprise
to the satisfaction of the donor. Sir Horace Plunkett it -the most, unselfish
man in Ireland. His official salary as president of the Agricultural Organiza
tion Society is $6750, which he turns back into iti funds, refusing to receive
a penny for his services. Fired by his example and ' carried away by his
convincing arguments, certain great capitalists in Dublin and Belfast have
contributed; millions for the construction of . electric tramways and freight
steamers to carry, at mere cost of transportation, farmers' "produce to the
English markets. The investors have announced thej do not expect to de
rive any profits or interest in this enterprise. Village libraries and reading
rooms, music, out-door sports, study of Gaelic and the beautifying of cot
tapes, by the cultivation of flowers and shrubs, are all encouraged by him.
He tramps day after day through towns and . villages,, visiting .the. most
wretched cabins, striving to give hope and practical help to the poorest, and
most despairing. Through his newspaper, called the Irish Homestead, he of
fers money prizes to the co-operative society which has done most to make
the village a place from which no Irishman would wish tcTerntgrate.' Money
prizes are offered the most deserving of all the Co-operative Industrial Soci
eties which has the effect of encouraging healthy competition in all parts of
Ireland. No barroom loafer, no hard drinker, no brawler is wanted as a
member of these co-operative societies and banks. He would be blackballed
if he tried to join. Sir Horace Plunkett has done his work quietly and unos
tentatiously, without flare of trumpet or designs of personal ambition. He
stands forth to-day in the eyes of the people of Ireland as a great patriot, a
pxeat economic and successful social reformer/. Above and beyond'the stress
of parties and warring creeds he has won the hearts of all his countrymen.
The vintage festival of the ancient Greek* was most elaborate and of
greater import to them than any other. With the Romans the festival was
supposed to be presided over bv the goddess Cer?-,.
But Thanksgiving day in America has a jar deeper meaning than in any
of the old pagan countries. Then it i* that our sordid aims and selfish de
sires are forgotten and the best thina* in our nature* are resurrected. Amid
all. the feasting and reioicinz we remembef the Omnipotent Power back of it
all and in it all, and to that Power we gladly give thanks and praise.
f^^_ â¢*> â ri AYS set aoart for thanksgiving have been known as far
1^3FZ0^Â£2.f back as the Israelites, but Thank?Â£ivir:~ in the United
(i IFit^C^^* States was first instituted by the piisrrim fathers at Plv
â¢5 *^^^s}l mouth in 1621. It then became a reco~r:iz;d holiday : r.
** ew E n ~' an(1 - an( *Â« a3 the S rc3t family festival, took the
JT7agÂ£Â£Â«<j^Â£'Â£*Y; place of Christmas. The date is set as the la>t Thursdav
iCMff^ssisaB&BSB in November and is proclaimed by the President of the
United States. Thanksgiving days were no uncommon thing in England
prior to the Reformation, and afterward with the Protestants. In 1S72. even.
a thanksgiving day was appointed to give praise for the recovery of the
' Prinre of Wales from typhoid.
A minister by the name of Wolfall is said to have conducted the first
thanksgiving in North America, on the shores of Newfoundland, in 1578.
They were merely thanksgivinz services, which only consumed a few hours.
A day especially set apart for praise and joy must b- attributed to Governor
Bradford, the first Governor of Massachusetts Colony. This was in praise
for the bounteous harvest of 162T had been' preceded by great want
and barrenness. Here it is that Â¦_ -:r honored Thanksgiving bird, the turkey,
made his debut. The Governor serf... out men in search of came to bs con
sumed on this festive occasion, and they returned well laden with wild fowl
consisting largely of the luscious Thanksgiving bird. They obtained enough
to last a week They, of course, did not have the elaborate et ceteras which
with us accompany this proud bird on our groaning tables, but the wives set
to work and made all the Brood things possible to evolve from so limited a
supply of material. At the dawn of that auspicious day a salute was thun
dered forth from the cannon, and the Pilgrims formed a solemn procession
and marched to the "meeting house." After the service was ended the
great dinner was served, and its delicious aroma must have traveled some
distance, for right in the midst of the festivities an Indian shout pierced the
air. and ninety red men â fortunately friendly ones â appeared on the scene
under the command of Kincr Massasoit They contributed their quota to
the feast in the shape of huee haunches of venison. The day. instead of beins
one, was prolonged into three, and psalms and songs were mingled with the
feasting. Interlarded by war dances by the red men and military drills bv the
well trained soldiers of Captain Standish. There were also other sports,
such as characterized the middle class of English people in that period. This
festival was the initial one of many Thanksgiving days throughout the
New England colonies^ Sometimes it was held once a year and sometimes
twice â when they had a victory over the Indians, or a ship h3d arrived with
plentiful supplies, or the harvest was bountiful. v Venison or bear's meat
graced the festal board in the pioneer days of Rhode Island and Connect
icut.
During the Revolutionary War Thanksgiving lost some of its local N'ew
England character. On December 18, 1777, Washington issued a proclama
tion for a general Thanksgiving by the Continental army, and acain at Val
ley Forge in 1778. In 178Q, shortly before Congress had adjourned, it was
moved in the House that the Prcsideat be requested to appoint a dav of
thanksgiving and prayer. The original manuscript of this proclamation, in
teresting as the first ever issued by a President, is now in the hands of a
New Hampshire man, who had it as an heirloom from hi3 grandfather.
Our Thanksgiving of to-day is handed to us from the past, and has many
of the genial features of Christmas. With the Yankee* it was the one time
of the whole year when the sunlight was permitted to enter their barren,
penurious home life, and its coming was anticipated with an excitement of
which the modern Yankee knows nothing. Those stern old souls were
thrilled and to.uched by its reunions and vacant chairs.
Cider and mince pie were on the tables of rich and poor, and always a
fowl of some kind. No tramp ever went hungry at that time, and even the
poorhouse had its turkey. Old feuds were patched up. old enemies recon
ciled, and. for a time, at least, men forgot hate am! retribution and thought
only of forgiveness and brotherly love. It was more beneficial than alt
the fifty- two Sundays put together.
In the^ middle of the century it was fashionable to make calk at that
time and rivaled New Year in that respect. Another custom was to dress
fantastically and parade the streets.
Thanksgiving has lonz been celebrated, even among heathen nations.

their work that you find it satisfactory to have them all in^ the same clas3? "
Any plan which does not make possible the answer. "Yes." to this question
is not worthy of a place in the schools of the present century.
As schools are generally graded the following are some of the ob:ec
x. Pupils are not placed or kept with those of equal advancement.
2. The bright are injured by being held back; the slow by be:nz hur
ried on.
3. The work cannot be well suited to the pupils ia the classes.
4. The work is not done thoroughly.
5. The school life of the majority is shortened and the intellectual life of
all menaced. '
6. Eighty per cent lose time, whereas at least 75 per cent are able to save
time under a proper plan.
7. Seventy-five per cent do not go as far as the fifth year ia a tweve
years' course.
8. Less than 5 per cent reach the high school, and not core than 3 cer
cent graduate.
9. The lessons are generally prepared at home, though there b 20 good
reason why they should not be prepared in school.
10. Compelled to walk in lock-step with those who cap and should bÂ«
allowed to move at a different rate, a great many lose all interest ia school
work. They therefore leave school.
In Elizabeth, a city of 6000. the following advantages are not-d: No
teacher need retain in any class any pupils not fitted for the work of the
class. No teacher ia required or permitted to take any class over the work
faster than they can do the work thoroughly. No pupil below the grammar
grade is permitted to have any home study. In the higher trrades they are
not" permitted to have over one hour's home work. From 5 to 8 per cent are
reclassified each month, that they may be where they can work to advantage.
But few have lost and 75 per cent have gained time. The attendance in the
higher grades has increased trreatly and that of the high school has increased
over 400 per cent since the plan was adopted.
Is there another place which can substantiate similar claims? Yet there
is no good reason why every town and city in the United States should not
have all these advantages.
Whose fault is it? Not the pupils'. Not the teachers*. Generally no?
the principals'. It is the superintendent's function to provide a proper plan
of grading. If he has not done so he must bear the responsibility. If the
Board of Education has interfered and prevented the superintendent's provid
ing the proper plan, then the responsibility must rest upon the Board of Edu
cation. Superintendents dare no longer plead ignorance as an excuse for not
having provided a method of grading which makes it possible for the
teacher to suit the work to the needs of the child, in place of compelling the
teacher to force the child into Procrustean grades of work.

gloomily; "*niaybe the plumbers got it out

She pointed to the nuns' chest against
the Katt, and the burglar obediently start
ed trp lo do her bidding. An Inner chest
cf '.T'jn was disclosed, having two pro
y^tlng handles.
"Lift the cover," commanded Miss Mer
ryweather.
A smile of grim expectation parted her
firm lips; now approached her triumph.
The burglars laid his hands on the knobs
and pensively nodded his head, screwing
up his mouth like a man recognizing a
familiar flavor.
"Yes'm," said he; "galvanic battery,
ain't it? Kinder prickly!"
"I'll weaken the current," said Miss
"Humph!" said Miss Merryweather.

stay there until I come up again. Don't
you burgle any until I come back; then
we'll see what we can do." , â¢ .
"You ain't going to telephone to the
police to nab me?"
Miss Merryweather waved her hand to
ward the wall at a telephone.
"It isn't customary in houses of people
who are not millionaires to have two tele
phones." said she. "I am going to bring
you something to eat".
"I won't touch a thing, lady/' promised
the burglar; "I've been druv* to this, I
truly have."
"I don't want to disturb you, ma'am,"
be repeated, "but I've got to have some
money."
"Why?" said Miss Merryweather. She
was quite at her ease and had taken a
rocking chair.
"Why?" the man echoed bitterly. "Be
cause I prefer to steal to see my wife
dying for want of things done for her,
and my children without shoes to their
feet, and never a bite among us all this
day, by â I beg your pardon, lady; I was

"Haven't you bad anything to eat to
day r f said Miss Merryweather.
He shook his head. A stiff lock of
brown hair which stood up on the top of
his head waggled at the motion. It gave
him a grotesque look. "He certainly was
frightfully thin.
When Miss Merryweather loomed upon
himâ one may say darted, since that was
the effect of the springing of the light
upon her imageâ he lifted his empty hand
to his bat.
"Certainly not; at least, not until I can
see you," said Miss Merryweather. All
the while she was hastily donning a wrap
per and slippers. Then she turned on the
lights. The burglar stood directly under
the blaze. He did not look like a burglar.
There was nothing much in his pale face
except the look of recent sickness and
hopelessness. His clothes were like any
workman's, a pair of blue, soi^d overalls
with something like a bib front and a
patched, checked shirt. His hat (it was a
hat. and not the cap In which artists, for
reasons best known to themselves, delight
to depict the burglar) was a very bat
tered, soft felt, and It was not pulled
down over his black brows; It was pushed
back from dark brown locks. He looked
like a workman out of a Job! His hands,
one of which held a pistol, were calloused
and stainedâ a workman's hands.
"only no pulling out a pop, you know,
and firing It off at me in the dark, bit or
miss!"
She thought of waking the sleeping dog
and taking him upstairs; but the peril
to the china of Diogenes' clumsy bulk
seemed so much greater to her intrepid
soul than any personal danger from the
mild-mannered burglar that she dismissed
the suggestion as soon as it appeared.
When she entered her sitting-room again
and saw how starved and tired her burg
lar looked she was glad of her decision.
He was leaning back in his chair, his
pistol still In one limp hand, his head laid
back, showing his miserably thin neck,'
and the white glare full on the haggard
pallor of his face.
His eye brightened at the sight' of the
tray. Miss Merryweather, making no com
ment, lighted the lamp under the silver
chafing dish, and as it burned she but
tered the slices of bread and placed beef
between them.
"I am afraid the beef is a little under
done for your taste," observed she. kindly,
" and I hope you don't care for mustard,
for I forgot it, but I've pot on salt and
pepper, and .they were the best-done
pieces I could . find. The soup will be

glass of wlnÂ«." ;
The man drank It, keeping his eyes on
her. Then he laid the pistol on the table.
I ain't going to use it," he said.
"Much better not," returned Miss Mer
ryweather. "The truth is, I have long had
a curiosity to see a burglar, and I rather
have planned things that way; 'but I did
n't expect he would be so decent as you
seem. How do you like that wine? It's
old Jacques port."
The burglar looked rather bewildered,
but answered that it was the best wine
he had ever tasted. He added ingenuous
ly that he had "hot tasted much wine."
"You are not at all like a professional
burglar," remarked the lady, who. had
now come, to ladling, out . the steaming
Miss Merryweather encouraged him by a
nod and departed, lighted candle In hand.
Never, it seemed to her, had she heard
so many sinister noises as pricked her ears
while her candle flitted from pantry to
sideboard. Boards creaked under her
tread as they never creaked In the day
time, and every door she touched sent up
a long shriek of remonstrance.
But Diogenes slept cajmly In the laun

She carried a revolver In her hand, which
she laid on the tray. "He seems like a

She continued: "I suppose you are put

before he began. "I never seen a lady

you the honest truth. I was working in
Chicago, I belonged to the Junior Plumb

"Oh, if you were a plumber It must

The burglar acknowledged the sally by
a faint smile. "We ain't so tad as they

my wife I had got a Job and I would have

time, flrst deciding on one house and then

upstairs, and says I. 'That lady is all
alone by herself, and I can git some
money easy.' So I come."
"But how did you get In? The windows

they look like good winders;

I cannot find any good moral in this
tale, unless It be contained In Miss Merry
weather's own subsequent reflection:
"Now, aren't the ways of Providence
queer? Here'3 my burglar's got a good
plumber shop and lots of custom, simply
by an unsuccessful attempt to rob. But.
then. It is a merciful thing that, as our
best lntentlor.3 are liable to bring harm
and misfortune, so our bad ones run off
the track sometimes, too. And, anyhow,
it wasn't because he was a burglar he
waa so lucky, but because he was such a
remarkably gentle and propitiating burg
lar! If he hadn't been I should have had
to shoot him or 'sic* Diogenes on him. I
hope it will be a lesson to us both that
it is better far to rule by love than fear,
and kind words can never die. and all
that kind of thing! And It was certainly
a mercy to me that I feel truly thankful
for. I don't know how I could have
beaten the plumbers without him!"
The plumbing was done, and well done,
by 4 of the next afternoon. The burglar's
family, as well as the Merryweather'a
gathering, dined late that Thanksgiving.
The household knew too well Miss
Merryweather'a generosity, for these spe
cial efforts, to be unhappy; but Robblns
summed up the general mixture of disap
probation and admiration. She said:
"Did you ever see the like! I believe
Miss Elinor would git her will If she had
to tear the world up by the roots!"
"As soon as you can; there's no time to
lose." said Miss Merryweather. "He la a
good plumber," she announced calmly to
her dazed domestic staff, "and I was
lucky to get him. I have sent a basket
of things to his family. Get him a gooel
breakfast to-morrow morning, and I hope
we shall have a Thanksgiving after all.
I shan't forget how good you all are in
these emergencies."
"No, ma'am; thank you, ma'am," the
burglar responded meekly, "and I'll be
back "
"Nothing Is the matter," said Miss
Merryweather. "I stepped on the mat
myself. It works perfectly. Harriet. I've
engaged a plumber, and ho la to work all
night, and the plumbing will be done by
to-morrow afternoon. If you need those
extra tools, you'd better go home and gtt
them now,"â turning upon the bewildered
burglarâ "and you don't need that candle
any more, put It down. Don't forget the
basket."
She was at the hall door before she
ended, calling loudly to the shrieking
maids, who came In timidly (except Rob
bins), In the rear of the two men, who
were none too valorous.
"No, you will not," said Miss Marry
weather, all herself again, "you will stay
Just where you are while I open the
door."
"I guess the mats Is straight good.V
said the burglar. "You trod on It by mis
take, ma'am. Say. ./hat's that? They're
a hollering In the yard! I'll try this
door "
Miss Merryweather had very much the
sensations of a burglar in her own hou^-e.
and she despoiled the larder, the friendly
burglar holding the candle. They hurriel
at every glimpse of the clock, they trem
bled at all the creaklngs of the floor.
"Robbins never did stay out before later
than 13 or 1; It's a quar Great heav
ens!" Miss Merryweather Jumped. Sud
denly she was bathed In a flood of light.
and bells seemed to be ringing all over
the house.
"Hain't you weakened the current?" de
precated the burglar. "Pshaw! I thought
you had. or I wouldn't 'a' taken them
down. I'm real sorry."
Miss Merryweather laughed. "Every
thing la a failure." said she. "You ou?ht
to be held a prisoner, with your shouluers
hunched up. It's all wrong."
"Oh. no. It ain't, ma'am." the burglar
tried to reassure her. "I ain't no manner
of doubt that them mats downstairs
would work splendid; we kin try poinu
down. But these hero galvanic batteries
ure mighty unreliable. Never mind. I kin
f.x It all right for you. I'm glad I came,
theiugh."
"So am I," said Miss Merryweafher.
"Do you think something is the matter
with this, too?"â displaying her revolver.
It was a big revolver of glossy and iri
descent black, not a feminine frippery
about Itâ no pe.irj. no silver: a revolver
that meant business and showed its tn
tentlons honorably.
"No. it's all right." said the burplar.
admiringly. "You could 'a* plugged m<Â»

"Unless you shot me first."
/'Humph! that would 'a' been difficult
seeln' mine ain't loaded and there's some

"Well." sighed Miss Merryweather. "It's
a mercy you tried to burgle me with that
useless thing, instead of some one el?e.
Now. for goodness sake come downstairs
and let me give you that basket and get
you off before the servants come."
Merryweather: "yju must be a perfect
E par tan not to call out."
"Well, you 6ee, I ruther nuspldoned
what It was." the burglar replied, letting
his hands drop.
"How can you get your hands away?"
cried Miss 'Merryweather.
Of course It was not well; but Mies
Merryweather Just then did not think of
the nicer mea ling of words.
"Yes, ma'am," the voice repeated: "don't
bÂ«? alarmed; I'm a manâ a burglar!"
Miss Merryweather showed no signs of
alarm. In the first place, she had a fear
lens soul; in the second place, the voice
was so mild, so almost apologetic, that it
aroused her sense of humor.
"I don't know but that you are less
of a nuisance than the dog would be."
paid she. "You stay right where you are,
and I will turn on the electric lights.
Don't move or you'll hit something!"
"All right, ma'am." said the burglar;
Sternness was the only chance! "Down,
charge. Di!" she commanded. "Bad dog!
Down!"
A particularly mild voice answered her:
"It ain't a dog, miss: It's a man!"
"A man?" repeated Miss Merryweather.
"Well!"
if 5he called to the dog kindly he would
begin wagging his tail, that tremendous
brush which, with one sweep, might hurl
her Idols into Irredeemable, smashing.
crashing ruin!
BUM :.*>rry weather was not used to be
beater: it palled. She had mailed letters
to different plumbers asking for bids by
telegrepn: but. peer as she might, sho
eou:<> i Â«it Fee a loophole of escape for her
self :his time. She went to bed eariy,
but for Â¦ long while she could not sleep.
She th'.uxnt cf the Plumbers' Union and
her own defeat Â«nd raged anew.
And when, at last, the was Just slipping

Hadn't >he closed the door? Her mind

closed mm of the kitchen doors. Hadn't
she Closed the kitchen door upstairs? She
hadâ at least ehe had seen that the door
to the cellar was fast and she thought
ehe had bolted the door upstairs. How
did people e\ - tr feel certain enough about
anything to swear that It happened? The
footrtcpa were nearer, in the sitting room
which â¢ adjoined the chamber. Her first
thought was for the safety of the tcatable
with its precious freight. She was sure
"Nn, poor fellow," she murmured; "most
likely he is lying dead In some alleyway,
with all h'.s ribs broken. They do such
things."
Therefore it waÂ« with a gloomy soul she
beheld the night before Thanksgiving.
"I never was en little thankful In my
life," vhe tr.urmured, "and I was so bent
on having that plumbing done In time to
have K'lcn, and show that Vance that I
am a mutch for the Plumbers* Union, if
I am a lctie woman."
Miss Merryweather was sure he had
either been bought off or assassinated by
the union. She paid no heed to thÂ« theory
meekly tendered by Helen's husband, to
wit: that, knowing the man's habits, he
had cause to suspect he was simply celÂ«

Her latest dilemma engroK^ed her to

not afraid of sewer gas? And her niece
(who was as a daughter to her) did not
dare to bring the baby to spend Thanks
giving because the child might catch diph

*'Stuff "' said Miss Merryweather, who
used strong expressions sometimes, being
by birth and breeding quite too great a
lady to disturb herself about the minor
conventions. "Stuff and nonsense! There
are no leaks. But I'm not going to argue
with you. Helen. I shall get a plumber

Then, discerning a peculiar smile on the
amiable features of Helen's husband, she
aÂ£Â£ed gravely: "He will not belong to

The general effect of these few words
upon the wily William ' can be compared
only to the feeling induced by the sudden
precfpftatloh of a large, adult Icicle down
the back of the average human neck on
a cold day. He was dazed for a time.
Then he gathered a few of his wits to
gether and cast a cursoryâ not to say pro
faneâglance around him. As nearly as
he could figure it out the difference be
tween the operations of himself and his
venerable parent on his father's side con
sisted in the fact that he put up cash and
picked the long odds on the chance that
the rest of the field would fall dead in the
stretch while his parent aforesaid never
something after this manner. "My son,
your course of sin and unpaid bills is cal
culated to bring your aged parent's gray
hairs down in sorrow to the cold and
silent grave, or at least to a forty-dollar*
a-month flat. In childhood you were the
light of my life and my hope for the
future. Now it's my pocketbook that Is
light and unless some of my deals in
futures go the right way it's likely to be
a good deal lighter before the game is
done. I have toiled early and late over
the perspiring ticker In order that you
might carry an honored name and a' large
bank account through life, and this is
how you requite my loving labor. While
I am going to and fro In the narrow little
thoroughfare where the business of the
world and the dear public are done daily
you are idling away your time In abodes
of sin. where the other man gets all the
money and you get nothing but experience
that is not negotiable. While I .have
striven early and late selling Consolidated
Hot Air short and inducing my friends
to buy long you have been wasting my
substance in riotous living and you have
not even acquired the habit of winning.
The author of his being, who had been
tempted often to dispose of the copyright,
had endeavored In many ways to wean
him from his ways of sin, but without
success. He had sent him to college,
where he might delve in ancient lore and
hold communion , with the spirits of the
pact. , But the spirits with which William
held most frequent \ communion were of
the vulgar present, although he was
usually on hand .when he thought that
they/were likely to be passed. This seem
ing paradox can be ' understood only by
those who are familiar with the.ways-
and meansâ of our institutions of learn
ing. William* had acquired an extensive
and. valuable knowledge of anatomy from
his study of bones and a wide acquaint
ance with royalty as depicted , on. the
pasteboards with which he beguiled the
weary hours. In other respects his col
lege course may be said to have been
more or less of a failure, and the upshot
'of it* was 'the granting of an indefinite
leave of absence by the faculty for ser-.
vices renderedâ by the Deputy Sheriff.
Despairing of seeing his son one of the
leading Intellectual luminaries of the day
the' old man decided to give him a chance
to break into business. If he had -locked
the door and given him a Jimmy the
chances are that the boy would have land
ed on the Inside in record time, but Wil
liam was of too fine fiber to waste the
precious hours of youth over a desk when
there was any new .way of losing money
that he hadn't ; tried. His applications
for a day off during the racing season
were as numerous as those of an experi
enced office boy with : a large family of
aged relatives in poor health, and the
only early bird that he ever imitated was
the'owL. Finally, after having paid Wil
liam about 150, per cent more than he had
earned, his alleged. employer was forced
to forego the pleasure of his presence In
the shop.
" In "despair" William's father summoned
him into his presence and addressed him
for William.
yOUNG William Blnks was engaged I
In giving a close and persistent 'im-***
itation of the black sheep of the
Binks family. Black sheep, from
the time of the late but not par
ticularly lamented Cain down to the more
recent but not more lamented William,
have had many specialties. Some are de
voted to the grand old art of internal ir
rigation; .tome amuse . themselves-'., by ':â¢
shooting their, fellow men full of large,
impressive holes and relieving him of his
available supply of cash assets, and some
write historical novels. William's partic
ular penchant was an addiction .to vari
ous and sundry .occupations humorously
called games of chanceâ by the dealer be
cause of the chance that some one. may y
get tired and quit before his money is
all goneâ and devised for the special pur
pose of fulfilling the ancient saying anent
the ultimate separation of nine-tenths of
the human race from their coin. . ' .
When other young men who were a .
source of pride and income to their loving
families were busy marking- down the
prices on bargains from '75 to 74 per cent (
profit or assisting in gathering the annual
clip of lambs' wool In Wall street, he was
watching the bay pony with a hundred
and twenty-five pounds and $14 of W11-.
Ham's money up making- a' last despair
ing effortto get in before the next race
was started, or computing the chances of
filling a straight from' both ends and tha
middle.' . . :
It is needless to say that William was
a great trial to his father, likewise to his
mother, his sister and the police magis
trates. In fact, William participated in
a trial : of . some sort about every other .
week. There were few ways of prevent
ing his aged parent from giving, a dem
onstration of the surpassing ease with
which â¢ an adult camel can pass through'"
the eye of a needle that he had not taken
a fling, at and the chances 'were good for
the' accomplishment of that desired end.
His motto was that time honored remark
of John J. Horace of the Sablne stock
farm to the effect. that it ia exceedingly
pleasant to "act the" fool* in' the "proper
place, and any old place was good enough
(Copyright. 1303, by Albert Britt.)
As a result of our careful study of the
case of William it is respectfully submit
ted to all prodigal sons, black sheep and
other small dealers that the American
Association for the Promotion of Knock
kneed Aphorisms prevents all self respect
ing union rules from working both waysâ
if at allâ and that what is sauce for tie
goosa ia likely to be caviare for the gaa
der.
When these few impressions had had
time to soak into his system thoroughly
William came to the conclusion that the
Â¦in of gambling lay in the imminent dead
ly danger of putting your money on the
wrong horse. When you knew how the
deal was going to turn out it was a busi
ness Investment. Thereupon he made up
what was left of his mind and went forth
to form a trust for the manufacture of
golf balls. When his father heard the
glad news he bowed his gray head and
wept for Joy at the sight of the prodigal
returned to a safe and profitable business,
and forthwith took him into partnership
and showed him how he could make twice
as much money in half the time in a
graft as g(u)ilt-edged as a Government
contract.

When he questioned them as to the es

he was informed by his mother that the

that no one could ever make any use of

as she did could hope to win any way.
From his sister he learned that there was

Judge J. B. Southard, familiarly known
as "Ben Southard," was a hater of shams.
A pretentious Arizona Jurist, who owed
his elevation to. the bench to his cousin
ship to a President's wife, was one day
vaunting his own character and career
before Ben Southard. "I made It a rule."
said the boaster, "when I was on the
bench, never to know a friend from an
enemy. I would decide & case in favor of
an enemy and against a friend Just ns
soon as I would the other way." "That
was my rule exactly," replied Ben. "But
when my enemy swore one way and my
friend another, I always believed my
friend."
"Prisoner," said Judge Southard to a
culprit who stood trembling before him,
"you have pleaded guilty i to the charge
of bigamy.* Â¦ Who is twice married Is
twice punished. This court will let you

gression, but since the case at bar seems
not to Interest your Honor I thought
while we were reviving old cases I might
with advantage offer a few remarks on

"The court accepts your explanation,
Mr. Blair," said Judge French, "and does

A change of coat is practically all that
is necessary when an afternoon call or a
"5 o'clock" is to be the next ceremony.
This is the frock coat, which is called
Prince Albert with persistence, probably
for the reason that Prince Albert, consort
of the late Queen Victoria, never wore a
garment at all like it. These coats are
sometimes longer in the skirt than at
other seasons; one year they show the

It may be stated that no society man Is
properly equipped for the business and
pleasure of modern life without at least
seven different suits in his wardrobe, bath
robe and pajamas not included. For the
morning sports, whether it is a ride or an
hour on the links, or even a bicycle spin,
a particular suit is required. No well
meaning man will ride 1n*the park these
winter mornings . except in his doeskin
trousers, his short, natty jacket, his ac
curate derby and gloves. Nor will he
either bicycle or golf without Incasing his
Clothes for Modern Man.
But there was one member of his bar
who was annoyed at this habit of the
Judge and who determined to express his
objections at the first . opportunity. One
warm afternoon in August, when the val
ley of the Glla was seething and all the
Idlers in Florence were sweltering under
the shade of the dirt-roofed piazza which
surrounded the old adobe building which
served for a courthouse, this gentleman,
who was employed for the defendant In
a noted divorce case, was contending be
fore Judge French that the rule of law
that the residence of the husband is the
residence of the wife did not prevail in an
action for divorce brought by a non-resi
dent wife against a resident husband.
Counsel paused for a moment in his ar
gument to pour for himself a glass of
water. "Mr. Blair," said the court, "I am
satisfied that the decision of the Supreme
Court of California is not law; I am sat
isfied that in an Indictment for stealing
bulllion from a mining company it is not
necessary to state whether the company
is a corporation or an individualâ go on,
Mr. Blair." The counsel stood quietly
and received the Interruption^ The re
marks of his Honor referred 'to a bullion
stealing case In the trial of which Mr.'
Blair bad participated a week ! previous.
last day of the term It was argued at
great length before him. The Judge was
due to open court at Mineral Park, a hun
dred and forty miles distant, the follow
ing week. He was the possessor of a light
ambulance which he used In traveling the
circuit; but he owned no horses, finding
it more convenient and economical to hire
animals for each journey. "Gentlemen."
said- the court, "this motion which you
have so elaborately and ably presented
will Involve for its determination the ex
amination of a large number of author
ities, and I will not have time to look into
them until after my return from Mineral
Park. I will therefore take the motion
under sdyisement until then. And, gen

derstand that you are both going to Mo

glad to have you occupy seats In my am
bulance during the Journey, and I sug
gest that It will promote both the ends
of Justice and our personal comfort if I
also take the mules under advisement.
The court hear* no objection. Mr. M.,
you represent the plaintiff in this case
and you are a native of Missouri and
naturally understand the needs and char
acteristics of mules. I appoint you judi
cial equerry for the trip. Mr. F., your
rotund form suggests familiarity with the
good things of life and where to get them.
I appoint you judicial commissary and re
mind you that we shall probably be
obliged to camp out for one or two nights,
and that the water to be obtained Is not

so. The mules will, I am sure, enjoy the
trip. Mr. Sheriff, adjourn court to meet
next Monday at Mineral Park."
Chief Justice French was a learned and
able lawyer, who possessed a private for
tune and who accepted the Doslticn of
judge because he liked the work. He was
not In the least taciturn and<Â»was not dis
posed to sit mum-chance and allow the
lawyers to do all the talking. He would
"chip in" and participate in any discus
sion before him with questions and dis
sertations and side-bar remarks, and if
the case at bar did not offer opportunities
for him he would refer to some other
case*. *Those lawyers who understood this
Idiosyncrasy of the Judge always hum
ored him, and listened patiently until he
was through, and! then proceeded with the
trial of the pending case.

matching his jaunty jacket.
The day thus auspiciously and correctly
begun draws to the business hours, and
for this Insistent period the dress which
varies only slightly from year to year
and from season to season must, be
donned. The sack suit Is the American's
Ideal of comfortable wear for business. It
happens to be a double-breasted sack with
two rows of three buttons each at the
moment. Next year It may be a double
breasted sack with but one row of but
tons, but while these changes are of vast
importance to the correct dresser they do
not Interfere .with the broad principle that
a short coat without tails is the business
man's choice.' Details may be left to the
nine tailors who are required, according
to the adage, to make a man.
But suppose a man has accepted an In
vitation to take luncheon with a party at
one of the fashionable restaurants.
The hour is set for half past 1, and in
order to dress correctly for that function,
unconventional-' though it may be, the
proper thing for him to do is to return to
his rooms (we are Just beginning to call
them Â¦fchambers) and make a new toilet:
He then dons that peculiarly American
garment called indifferently "morning
coat", and "cutaway." With this he must
not wear the comfortable soft bosomed
ehirt which goes so well with the sack
suit, s but don a pretty percale or any
other, shirt that is not plain
white. The expanse of linen"
belongs nowadays exclusively with the
evening suit. Trousers of cassimere, or

Judge Southard's death was as genial
and as filled with good fellowship as his
life. He was seated on the hotel piazza
at Santa Rosa conversing with some
friends. Suddenly he sprang to his feet.
"Good-by, boys," said he, "I'm off." And
he dropped lifeless at their feet.

It is only a fair tribute to the histrionic
powers of the actress to relate that when
the tangle was unraveled, the bedstead
restored and the curtain raised the roar
of laughter which greeted the catastrophe
was bushed to respectful silence, and the
scene was duly finished amid the tears
and cheers of the audience.
I was stage manager, and it is my proud
boast that I kept the company together
in perfect harmony with one exception
during fourteen consecutive weekly per
formances, which Included the dramas of
Bulwex. Robertson, Sardou and Boud
cault. Shakeepeare we did not attempt.
"We contemplated presenting "Hamlet,"
but the gentleman who was to delineate
the melancholy Dane insisted upon intro
ducing some original features, which he
claimed were Justified by the text, such
as a Sute solo by Hamlet in the Eecond
act, accompanied by a terpsichorean
dlvertlsement. When we refused to allow
him to have his way he grew insubordi
nate and left the company, with a threat
to shoot up the town and to begin bis ca
reer by making a target of any gentle
man who should attempt the part of
Hamlet in his place. As nobody became a
Ehlnlng mark for him we substituted
"East Lynne."
I had a large extension bed-chair in my
cQce, which at night was occupied as a
couch by our clerk. This was carried over
to be used as a bed for little Willie when
in the last act be passes In his checks.
The part of William was taken by a 6
year-old girl, who was one of our
"troupe." The stage official who set the
scene neglected to shoot the bolt which
kept the two ends of the chair in place,
and when Mrs. Fitch, who played the
Earl's daughter, threw herself In an
agony of grief upon the couch of the dy
ing child the head and foot boards of the
contrivance shut up with a click, like a
country jackknife, and as the curtain
went- down there^ was visible a pair of
gaiters poised toward the celling, while
the dying child howled. "Let me out; let
me out!"

edges were tipped with silvery radi

brown and drear, seamed with bending
orchards and vales like the lawn of para
dise, the upper Gi!a tumbling in cascades,

ghostly arms in the glocm, the electric
air, the indescribable charm cf the desert,

j'Â«-nc!!ed with the <Jaw/i. the song of the
lark, "the herald of the morn," bubbled
up in matchless melody over the rim of
the dark, and It was morning in Arizona,
Poor old Arizona. For twenty-five years
her matchless resources have been almost
untouched and her people have growled a
little, and hoped a good deal and waited
with longing and impatience for the tc^a
virllis of statehood, whose enfranchising
touch will invigorate the life and spur
the energies of Arizona, and bring to her
capital and people to develop her won
derful resources of field and forest and
mine.
Yet for the delay in achieving local
self-government. Arizonans themselves
have been not altogether blameless, for
*hen there was a Democratic majority In
Congress they would elect a Republican
delegate to Congress, and when Congress
was Republican they would hasten to
roll up a Democratic majority. Before
lR$a parties were not organized there and
all candidates were "independent." for
the people regarded both political parties
much as the South Sea islander looked
upon the new born twins, of which he
was the father. They were too small to
fight, and too IÂ«Â»an to be eaten, and so
he neither loved nor respected them.
Other cities of "the sun-klsspd land"
rray have a grander future than Prescott,
but none have greater beauty of location.
It Is nestled in a charming mountain val
ley, girt with pine c'ad hills and boasting
of a streamâ the Hassayampaâ which, un
like some other streams in Arizona, very
often has water in it. The railroad,
which now reaches it. has deprived it of
its former charm of isolation, when it
was a little world of itself. And a world
that was up to the times. It was adjacent
to Fort Whipnle # the headquarters of a
military department. There was a bril
liant coterie of officers and their families
end there was always "something doing."
Private theatricals, masked balls, dinners
and other functions kept the military
bands busy and the young men in an im
pecunious condition. The citizens were
enterprising and liberal, the mines were
rich, money was plentiful, and a little
theater, 'costing nearly 110.000, was erected
by voluntary subscriptions. Waifs of all
kinds drift into mining camps. We found
a lawyer, who had once been a scene
painter at Wallack's, a banker's assistant,
who was an ex-stage carpenter, and ama
teur actors were as plentiful as frogs In
April. A colonel at the fort was as clever
a light comedian as ever walked the
boards; bis wife was a renowned Wash
ington beauty and a clever actress. A
signal service operator proved an excel
lent character actorâ he has since gained
fame and fortune In New York as the
author of "My Friend from India," "The
Man from Mexico," and other dramatic
suocesses. Murat Masterson not only
was an artist with the brush, but he
played Joseph in Richelieu, and Damon
In Damon and Pythias, and the violin,
and the Oasis saloon with equal success.
He was a many aided genius, for he had
been first officer of a Confederate cruiser,
had taught mathematics in a Kentucky
academy, and was a leading lawyer in
Arizona and a member of the Legisla
ture. The bÂ«st furniture and draperies
and brie-a-brao of Prescott houses
adorned the stage on occasions, and when
we seeded a Cardinal'* guard for Riche
lieu we had at our service a company of
real soldiers from Fort Whlpple, who
dropped to their knees like hot potatoes
when his Eminence pronounced the curse
of Rome.

FOUNDER A YOUNG WOMAN.
The founder of this club, which, in
"The Lyceum," like' all English
â¢women's clubs, has one radical differ
ence from the American club. Its mem
bers "will net meet! They will not dis
cuss â that is, as a body in congrega
tion assembled. They will merely have
B. comfortable place to live In and x>rac-
In addition they purpose to keep
members in touch with active literary
life by means of an Information bureau
Tvhich hag been thought out on original
lines. A member of the Lyceum who
lives, for Instance, In California and
*a.nts to sell a manuscript in London,
WA be advised as to the best person to
eend it to. If she writes a book and
tvants it translated into French and
published in Paris, she will be given
the addresses of translator and pub
lisher. Museums and libraries all over
the Continent will co-operate with the
club eo that through It the California
member can get research work done,
or if she wants to come abroad and do
it herself she will be given, the proper
instructions to curators of Institutions
v-here her ctudy Is to be done. This
information bureau has been most min
utely planned &nd will Include such less
learned branches as theaters, concerts,
lectures, shops and current matters.
LONDON, Nov. 21.â There Is likely
to be a lot of American Interest a few
Â¦weeks hence in a unique club for
women which has been organized bo
quietly in London that this is practi
cally the first word that has been said
about it in print. It is evidently going
to be a big affair, with International
connections, and with money enough
already guaranteed to enable It to do
tilings en a large scale from the start.
Broadly speaking, the object of the
Lyceum Club, as it is to be called, is
to bring literary women and university
women the world over Into touch with
cne another. Not only are such writers
es Mrs. Humphry "Ward, John Oliver
Hcbbes (Mrs. Craigie), Flora Annie
Steel. Lucas ilalet, Beatrice Harraden.
Mrs. Meynell. Mrs. W. K. Clifford and
Miss Rhoda Broughton members of the
club committee, but the universities of
Newnham and Girton at Cambridge are
taking up the scheme. It Is understood
that* 150 women with scientific degrees
xsill come Into the new dub en masse
and the long-established "Writers'
Club** of London with Its 500 members
Is planning to merge Itself in the Ly
ceum.
LADY BAXFOTJB CO-OPEBATES.
Lady Frances Balfour, sister of the
Duke of Argyle and hence sister-in-law
of Princess Louise, King Edward's sis
ter, has heartily given her support to
the Lyceum and will bring with her
a large element of radical women.
Lady Frances, who does not agree in
politics with her brother-in-law, the
Prime Minister of England, is an ardent
vomaa suffragist, but so far as I can
discover the club will have nothing to
do with politics, or any other cause.
Others actively working are Lady Bat
tersea (of the Rothschild family); Mrs.
Pa^et Toynbee, wife of the famous
Dante authority and herself the editor
of the forthcoming Clarendon Press
edition of the Horace WaJpole letters;
Miss Elizabeth Maxbury, the Countess
dl BrazzL formerly Miss Cora Slocumb
of New Orleans, and Mrs. Alfred Stead,
formerly Miss Elaine Hussey of Indian
apolis, .daughter-in-law of W. T. Stead.
These ladies are to purchase a club
house in the very heart of London, with
as many bedrooms as a large hotel, to
give members In all parts of the world
a stopping place in London, and to pro
vide permanent residence for those who
live in London ard wish to make the
club their home. ':Â¦'Â¦', ]'.
Mr. Arter Is keenly enthusiastic at
the prospect of exhibiting In the "one

next June, and later in Berlin. He will
collect the more important of his pic
tures while in the United States, will
paint there T for a few weeks and then
return to England to get ready for his
exhibition. Among ' the American
women whose portraits may figure in
the collection are Mrs. George W. Kln

of Toledo, the late Mrs. Archibald
White, whose tragic death occurred in
New York last winter; Mrs. J. J. Wy

and Mrs. Fred Benedict, all of New

his cousin, who died in London last fall.

Cleveland, was yesterday given com
mission to paint the portrait of the
Archbishop of Canterbury. Mr. Arter
expects to sail for the United States in
a lew days, and win do the portrait of
the Archbishop in London Immediately
on hla' return to England. The h*ad of
the Church of England called on Mr.
Arter, saw his latest work, the painting
of Lady "Wiltshire, a celebrated Eng
lish beauty, and forthwith decided to
be "done" by the American. The Arch
bishop's only condition was that he be
allowed to 'go home and get his wife's
help in choosing the photograph from
which Mr. Arter will . make some pre
liminary sketches of his Grace. Thus
in another instanc* has the Archbishop

ion that Mrs. Randall Davidson has a

AMEBICAN ARTISTS LUCK.
LONDON, Nov. 21. â Andrew Carnegie
has been -having a pretty tiff with a
parson lately and has come out ahead.
Â¦The trouble was ovtt an offer of $30,000,
which he made recently to the town of
Ilford for the establishment of "a li
brary. " The rector of the parish church
who seems to 'be a sort of local Savo
narola, told hla congregation that what
they wanted was not trashy ! novels,
but bonfires in which to burn them.
This and other remarks attacking Mr.
Carnegie angered the millionaire so
much that he wired immediately with
drawing the offer. His decision caused
eucn a storm in the little Essex town
that the vicar's church was practically
boycotted and the vicar's life was made
miserable. Parishioners who had hith
erto respected him would pass him by
without recognition. Members of the
Town Council who favored the accept
ance of the offer appealed to Mr. Car
negie to reconsider his decision, but he
Insisted on an apology from the vicar
and this the vicar steadfastly refused
to give.
At last It was decided that a delega
tion be sent to Sklbo and appeal to the
great man personally. The strained
relations of the vicar and his congrega
tion were put vividly before him and
then,, after consulting his secretary,^ he
yielded. "After all.", said he "this vicar
of Ilford is but one man with, I sup
pose, one. ordinary man's . intelligence,
and as It appears now that he has not
much following in regard to his opin
ions about the education of the work
ing classes you can have the $50,000 and
It is to be hoped that the vicar will
never condescend to borrow a book out
of the library." [

sides the things themselves were so
exquisite! â great, cool pearls like sea
flowers, faintly rose; sapphires tenderly
blue as angel eyes; dtemonds as lovely
as the young dews of aMay morning.
They were In her hair, at her throat,
all over her corsage, and there was a
trayful of rings besides. Miss Harned
showed me some of these and smiled
softly as she said: "Mr. Sothern gen
erally sends me a ring when he feels
lonely."
Mr. Sothern must "feel lonely" quite
often, I thought as the call came for
Miss Harned's first act.
Then she returned, and during the
long wait we got to "Iris" again, and
"Iris," and again "Iris."
"What should you 'subhead' "Iris/ if
you had to?" I asked.
"The tragedy of a weak woman, I
suppose," the actress replied. "She is
weak. That's her tragedy. She has no
backbone. She would' have been all
right If things had gone fortunately
with her "
"All of us wouldââ"
"Pinero to me has made one big mis
take â he wouldn't truckle to the con
ventionsâIn not telling before the last
act that Iris suffers poverty for three
years before submitting to Maldonado.
Her suffering is not made clear* In

her poverty. She has' therefore your
sympathy in her falL"
"But Tess, of course, did not have a
'few pounds a week'â â Â¦"
"No, but to Iris that was nothing "
"I think the construction of 'Iris'
throughout by no means equals that
of 'The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.' "
"No, Pinero has thrown all sorts of
conventions to the winds here," Miss
Harned agreed. "Those curtains I They

funny way of putting things. That
dark scene with Trenwith and Irisâ â "
On second thoughts what Mrs. Camp
bell said about the dark scene shall go

"But what's the moral of the play
to you?â I'm not contending, for any
moral, but your press agent Insists on
several â " I put It.
"There are severalâ lessons, I should
Bay rather. One is that old men like
the lamented Bellamy have no right to
forbid a widow of, 26 to remarry. Oh,
there are lessons all over the shop to
me. It annoys me to hear the play
compared with 'Sappho' and 'Zaza.'
Where's the moral there? Both women
end up happilyâ at least in the Ameri
can plays. v Iris gets It all round."
"But what's the moral for a woman
like Iris?"
"There isn't any, of course. She's
born without the moral sense, like some
men. But do you notice trfat it is only
when she becomes poor that it begins
to offend? Of course, she's living with
Trenwlth In Switzerland, but her
friends are all round her thereâ the
money makes a vast difference in the
sin, I'm afraid. You said that Iris was
intensely false in your critique- â "
Miss Harned's tone was argumentative.
"Yes." ! :
"Does It strike you that she never
tells a He during the whole course of
the play?" Â¦ V
"No, It has not done so."
"She tells Maldonado she does not

been supremely interesting if Pinero
had made Iris end well, as Irises do end
weU not infrequently. Like Lord Quex
â a person of several pasts."
"That he would hardly dare to do,"
Miss Harned advanced. "I remember
playing a piece of Sardou's, 'Spirltisme.'
Bernhardt played it before me, and my
only consolation is that I played it five
weeks to her two! But that was the
plot. The wife sinned and the husband
took her back. However, he was a
spiritualist and thought that she had
been dead in the meantime! Even so,
the play wouldn't go."
"Maldonado really shows off more de
cently In a\ sense than Trenwlthâ
though his rampant animalism dis
counts most of the sacrifice he would
be supposed to make in marrying Iris,"
I suggest.
"Yes, why does Trenwith throw hgr
over? Yet he would not dare "
"Tanqueray daresâ â "
"And the resultâ v Oh, it's a pretty
hopeless business. Tet It does set peo
ple thinking. One lesson, I think, is
that it is* best to begin by being gen
erous to yourself. Iris' troubles come
largely through her generosity to oth
ers. She uses Maldonado's first check
to help someone else."
"The differing criticisms must amuse
you? Where did the play go best?"
"". "New York and Chicago. The funny
critics, of course, slated it. And they
are very; funny, some, of them. You
cannot but laugh, particularly when it's
about some one else! But I think a
Pinero play, written by a man who
never slights a letter of his work, who
Is master of his art, ought to be treated
in a dignified way."
"You IlkÂ© to play in problem plays?"
"I like to do everything," Miss Harned
said, in her big, vital way. "One can
not be an artist and confine oneself
wholly to one vein of work. Look at
the older actors. They did every
thingâMaggie's had a letter from home,
I know it from. her pink nose," Bhe
broke off, with a kind, droll glance at

. "I dare say Maggie could tell tales

And to my surprise, there flashed a

ing gray eyes and ran trickling down
her delicate, saucy, lonely little nose!
VIRGINIA HARNED HAS WORDS OF PRAISE FOR PINERO'S SKILL/ BUT THE LEADING CHARACTER IN

EXPRESS HER OPINION. ... . . â¢
Rose Coghlan i* faith! And thank
the gods for it!
Ever since I met Miss Harned last
Wednesday evening, I have been puz
zlingâdoubtless with othersâ over her
haunting suggestion of some one else.
A sister of the craft, I was sure, but
who? I knew immediately every one
whom It was not. even to Mrs. Camp
bell, but recalled only at the last the
opulent Coghlan. Rose Coghlan it is,
and there is more in the likeness than
meets the eye. The eye in fact has lit
tle to do with the case. Still, it's a
fair presumption that the brilliant
gray-eyed Irishwoman looked like
enough to Miss Harned once upon a
time to be a sister to her.
Since meeting Virginia Harned's
husband, one of the rare x personalities
of the stage. I had Ftrongly desired
to see E. F. Sothern's wife. Fate
seemed rather against it. Miss Harned,
worn out with traveling, was obliged
to rest on Tuesday. Tuesday evening
between acts she could give, but the
Interviewer was taking in the Tivoli's
problem opera. On Wednesday the
actress was engaged In an all-day re
hearsal and Btudy of the little playlet
she appeared in at the managers' bene
fit this week. Wednesday evening,
however, found both free, and The Call
person at the "Margaret Anglln"â the
star dressing-room of the Columbia
and thus brass labeled.
As the door opened my impulse was
to put my hands to my eyes. It was
not only the flash of the trayful of
Jewels, nor the dazzle of the mirror
with its frame of electric lights, nor the
sheen of the toilet trlnketry. but the
big, radiant personality of the actress
herself, as Bhe stood there In her pink
dressing-gown, bronze-gold of hair and
all warm rose and ivories as to skin.
Her frank "How d'ye do?" was as
sunny as her hair, her smile another
sort of sunburst, and altogether I felt'
very glad to have come In out of the
rain outside.
It was when Miss Harned began to
talk, however, that the Coghlan mem
ory began to obsess. The dancing gray
eyes, as I got their witty sparkle at
second hand through the mirror, doubt
less helped. But where before had I
found that impulsive, generous habit
of expression, that almo6t masculine
breadth of outlook, that racy humor?
"This Is your first visit to California,
Miss Harned?" I beganâ and felt de
lightfully conscious immediately that
the interview would take care of Itself
whatever I said.
"Since I was grown up," the actress
replied. "I was here with Mr. Sothern
In 'Captain Lettarblalr* ten years ago â
four years before I was married to him.
"How is Mr. Sothern?"
"Not so wellâ poor dear. The wire of
his beard in "The Proud Prince* caught
his lip and Bomehow poisoned It." The
little frown of anxiety that accompan
ied this booh melted away Into Mrs.
Sothern's characteristic "eet fair" ex
pression, and she paid: "Mr. Sothern
enjoyed his last visit here so much."
"When does he come again?"
"He may bring The Proud Prince' in
the spring.**
"We shall like it?"
"I don't eee why not. Butâ '* and
Miss Harned turned her delicate saucy
nose â that 6he was whitening â and her
merry, Irish eye my way. "It's the dif
ference of opinion that makes horse
races, sa Mark Twain ears."
I laughed and she laughed at she
said then, Just as Miss Coghlan would
have Bald ft: "Alnt he delicious?"
"But when are we to have Mr. Eoth.
era In one of his own plays? I always
fancy him coming out with a Stephen
Phillips' sort of poetic drama?"
"He writes very well, doesn't he?" his
wife said to that. "Perhaps come day.
But before then you may see me In
one of ray husband's plays. After Iris*
I am to appear In one. The Light That

"That's bo like Mr. Sotnernâ the

ground." I prophesied, and remembered
then that I was looking at the inter
preter of Iris, perhaps the most pecu
liarly unwholesome stage person that
has come this way. "But how differ
ent "
"From Irisâ yes,** said Iris* Inter
preter. Then she shrugged her plump
shoulders, and with a little sweep of
the hand that took in all the legitimate
and illegitimate luxury of Mrs. Bell
amy, said: "It will be a relief after all
this dirt.** /
"It is dirt, then?"
"Plnero doesn't class ft otherwise,
but there again there's a difference of
opinion. To Illustrate. We played two
engagements with the play in St. Louis,
and during the last I received two let
ters on the same dayâ I get stacks of
letters about It- These were both from
women. One of them had seen me on
my former visit and had since had a
baby. She had called it Iris! The
'other was signed *A Former Admirer,'
and said that since seeing me in the
play she had lost all of her liking and
respect for me!"
"Which do yQU Â£gree. with,?", '
"Well " the Iris began, and there
was the full, maternal note of the
Coghlan voice in hers, "I wouldn't call
my baby after thi woman. But, again,
I wouldn't turn my back on some one
I liked because she had played her."
"I wonder what Plnero thinks?" ;
"You never know."
"You know him then?"
"Don't you know that Pinero stage
manages every one of his own plays
on their first production here?"
"Henry Millerâ 'The Gay Lord
Quex â ' "
"John Hare brought it first to
America."
"Ah, pardon! So you went to Lon
don and Mr. Pinero rehearsed your
Iris?" ,
"Exactly."
"What Is he like? I've pictured him
Email, dark, nervous."
"Not a bit of it!" and Miss Harned's
rich, Baucy laughter blew my little
Plnero to atoms. "Why " and she
turned to the door," his shoulders
would hardly come through that door,
and hÂ«Â» Is well over six feet."
"Oh!"
"He is dark, though," she 'consoled;
"his hair is blackâ all he has. He has a
very fine, strong face and is very
charming and gentle in his manner.
Looks something like a farmerâout-of
door sort of look. Of course, gentle
manly â no don't 6ay that, It's such a
haberdaahy sort of word. I thought
you might get a little the wrong sort
of impression from my calling him a
farmer, that's all. I was never so
astonished in my life as when I first
eaw him."
"I am not the only person then!"
"Pinero has a wonderful sort of posi
tion " in England," Miss Harned went
on. "He lectures at the universities,
does all sorts of things."
"But he won't talk about his people?"
"No," and the little Harned mouth
made a small moue at some apropos
remembrance. "I asked Mr. Pinero
once what became of Iris after the play
closes. 'Oh,' he said, 'I fancy she goes
home to study a new part. Not too
soon, I hope, though.' " N
"His stage management must be a
marveL"
"It is. Why, those people who talk
of one's Interpretation â there's hardly
the -quiver of an eyelash In a Plnero
play that he has not thought out and
Insists upon! He is tremendously pre
cise. They tell comical tales of It
sometimes. There is a butler in one of
his plays who has to place a dish on a
table. At rehearsal the butler asked
him where to put the plane. 'Here,'
said Pinero, indicating the spot," and
Miss Harned illustrated with her hand
glass. "But he corrected himself then
and naid: 'No, It would be better
here,' " and the actress moved the
mirror a fraction of an inch nearer the
cold cream. "That is Mr. Pinero, only
slightly caricatured, I give you my
word."
"No wonder he Is the most success
ful of modern dramatists."
"No wonder," Miss Harned echoed.
"Everything in his plays is the result
of the most Intense thought. Have you
noticed sometimes his repetition of a
phrase â you won't notice it In the
audience, but in reading the plays?
That, in constant playing of them,
sometimes gets on one's nerves. One
feels the repetition must be noticeable
to the audience. I suggested once to
Boudcaultâ who Is almost Plnero â and
looks after his plays in New York, that
we should cut a few of these phrases
In Iris.' "Not a word,' Bouclcault in
sisted. And he was right."
"Maeterlinck is very fond of the same
sort of parallelism, you remember?" I
recalled. "It is extremely common, of
course, in every-day conversation. And
one finds the parallel line in all art.
Plnero, In using it, Is evidently well
aware of Its emphatic value."
"Plnero said a curious thing to- Froh
man while I was over there â that if he
had to begin again he would like to
begin in America."
"That is curious in the light of his
matures! choice of subjectâ the decad
ent in all his variety "
"Oh, there are Irises everywhere "
"But fewer here "
"Who knows?"
She rose then, with a last rosy pat
on her little upper lip â Maggie's cue.
Her maid, a slim, dark, adoring creat
ure, here brought out the first "Iris"
gown, a thing of net, spangles and
flowersâ dream number one. With
adroit hands the girl garbed Miss
Harned's shapely lengths in the dream,
then began to adorn her further with
Jewels. v
"These are the bane of Maggie's life â
aren't they?" the actress smiled up at
her maid, fitting a dazzling tiara to
her bronze gold halo.
The maid said feelingly, "yes," as
she clasped a "dog collar" of pearls
and diamonds round Miss Harned's
round throat.
"Butâ they're not real, of course?"
I asked. One may, of an actress.
"They areâ unfortunately, Maggie
would say." the actress said simplyâ
"that is, most of them."
. - It was . provincial, of course, but I
couldn't restrain a small "Oh!" There
was a king's ransom on the figure be
fore me, a life's leisure, freedom, all
the little things one wants. And be-
The production of ' Zaza" this week
at the Tivoli explains in part and fur
ther sets one to wondering as to the
reasons for the almost complete failure
of the opera in Italy, where it was first
produced in 1900. Of course, the reason
given by the Tivoli artists in discus
sion of the point, even, also, by Mr.
Steindorff â the newness of the plot to
Italian audiences â was glitteringly In
adequate. To begin with, the plot is
as palpable in the opera as in the play.
He who runs may read the story â
whether his legs be Latin or good
American. Neither Is it possible fur
ther for the farthest remove from Mrs.
Leslie Carter and the rest of the Belas
co cast of "Zaza" much to befog the
libretto. They did a thing or two in
that line at the Tivoli the other nightâ
but of that later. No, some other rea
son than the unfamiliarity of Its story
must be sought in explanation of the
opera's failure in Italy, and the produc
tion of this week is at least highly sug
gestive. There was, indeed, a small
percentage of Tuesday night's audience
that took what one may imagine for a
moment to be the general Italian atti
tude toward the opera. Their viewpoint
will at least serve as a basis for argu
ment.
With "La Tosca," bitter, burning,
ugly, painfulâ all things at times in its
music that to music have before been
forbidden; with the almost as vivid
realism of the familiar "I'Pagliacci";
with the intense dramatic thrillâ in its
trial scene â of "Andre Chenier"; with
the passionately colored "Cavalleria
Rustlcana," one has come to expect of
the modern/Italian some very definitely
denned and strongly marked character
istics. These, musical realism, the reds,
yellows and blackest blacks of the
tonal palette, the plots and rhythms of
the realistic drama, have indeed come
to be regarded as the chief virtues of
the new school. With "La Tesca" so
far as the apex of the genre, the whole
trend of the current effort of young
Italy may be said to be in the direction
of musically realizing the drama and
psychology of lust, murder, torture and
pain in their every-day brutality. The
actual bite of the scalpel, the actual
cry of the victim, the veritable thrill
of murder, lust, are things sought to
be portrayed in the new "verismo"
gamut. In brief, the merely beautiful
no longer satisfies the ear, already at
tuned to the mordant fascination of
ugliness. The beast has tasted blood
and blood it will have. And here is
where "Zaza" comes in. ->V
To go back for a moment, the/ques
tion is not at all whether the new real
istic menu is suitable for musical rep
resentation. Music Is being used to de
pict these things, and who shall bound
its domain? ,One may as well quarrel
with the tides as with the tendency.
And the "verismo" school has already
given us much that Is beautiful with
the traditional beauty of music, as well
as with the poignant thrill of what
has heretofore been known as ugliness.
It is only when in a blind adoration of
the new genre the public rejects any
other than-the prophets of its gospel
that it is useful to protest. "Zaza's,"
I believe to be a case in point.
In this, his latest work, Leoncavallo
has returned to the frankly tuneful,
semi-romantic school. There Is no at
tempt at ponderous psychologizing, hy
steric thunders, passions wrung to tat
ters. The composer has left the red
hair out of his score, as De Spada
omitted it from her make-up the other
night. He has emphasized rather the
comedy and sentiment of the story, and
accented the romance, and has succeed
ed in building an opera throughout
musically charming, interesting and
characteristic.
Best of all, perhaps, in Its Individual
value is the muslo of the first act.
Here, in the behind scenes setting of a
Parisian vaudeville temple, are In
geniously interwoven the little French
chansons of the "artists," with the
veritable vaudeville plunk of the ac
companiment, Zaza's and Dufresne's
drama j of meeting Cascart's faithful
note, the manager's excitement, the
comedy picture of Zaza's mother, the
quarrel of the stars, the excitement of
the company, Â¦ all told in delightful
musical gossip'. The whole scene is
handled most ingeniously, Dufresne's
cynical ballade of appreciation of Zaza
perhaps its musical gem.
The rest of the opera is all musically
interesting â it must be owned not Infre
quently in the Leoncavallo-cum-Grieg
manner, a la Mozart, in the fashion of
Massenet, even according to Mr. Bach.
Not , that there Is ever any direct
plagiarism. It is only that Leoncavallo
wears easily for moments the motley of
other men's manners, though always
with his own individuality looking
through* the cap and' bells. One does
feel, however, a certain lack of dram
atic strength in the work, to return.
It is quite easily ~ believable, however,
that with a fuller orchestra than the
Tlvoll brings to the work, and a Leslie
Carter sort of temperament in the title
role the tale would bo different. At
any rate one cannot as yet fairly judge
here. One thing certain is that the
opera. abounds in charming lyrics, and
that its orchestral setting is piquantr
characteristic, picturesque and imme
diately appealing. Concerted music Is
somewhat lacking, though there are a
few good choruses, notably the washer
woman's song at the opening of the
third act. Caseart has the pick of the
lyrics, though Zaza and Dufreane are
both well supplied. One peculiarly en
gaging and novel episode, and here the
music is of admirable tenderness and
simplicity, is the 6cene between Zaza
and Toto, the child.
But altogether the work is of excep
tional Interest and only the strong bias
In favor of the verismo school can ex
plain its rejection In Italy. It is the,
sort of thing the Opera Comique in
Paris has open arms for. and there
should surely be a place for "Zaza" on
any modern operatic repertoire with
any leaning at all to the popular ele
ment. : . â¢ ';
Our local Introduction to the work
was not wholly fortunate. Unhappily,
with Mrs. Carter's splendiferous ap
pearance In the play, and Florence
Roberts' hardly less dazzling setting, a
certain standard of sartorial sumptu
ousness has imposed itself on the local
mind. It is unfortunately "part of it."
One accepts readily enough the Queen
of Sheba in cheesecloth trimmed with
gold paper, but Zaza in a 75-cent wrap
perâno! Never! There may be rea
sons of course, too â they were not in
evidence â for the between-knee-and
ankle length of De Spada's short skirt
In her variety scene. But they were
not Zaza's. The little Duchess looked
much more like a little Dresden shep
herdess in her Irgentt blue than the
sultry fury of the story. And where,
oh where, were Zaza's impassioned
locks? Miss Barker perhaps had
"hooked" them? Her make-up was
certainly more apropos. Mamma, too
(done splendidly by Marcheslni), had
hers with her. And where again were
the eel-like skirt, and elegant sinful
ness of waist of the other acts? It was
Impossible to suspect the morals of a
person in the lumpy skirt and uncom
promising waist â stern black and white
â In which De Spada Indulged. And
really one knows that Zaza was no bet
ter than she should be!
What do- I want for 75 cents? Well
I'm not asking for the Harned gowns
round the corner,- but a little care and
an expense so slight that it cannot be
considered would have here made all
the difference. It is not Miss de Spada's
fault, but the management's, and
rather characteristic of the slackness
that has somehow ; characterized the
whole season. Otherwise the make-ups
of the- cast were clever as the Tlvolt
not seldom shows â Gregoretti's as a
vaudeville performer, Cortesl's as a
theatrical manager, Marcheslni's as the
comedy mother, Karl Formes as a
monologlst, all these and more delight
fully humorous.
Again, of course, De Spada lacks the
dramatic force for her part, though
she was pretty, piquant and tactful In
the role, never trying to overstep her
capacities. The rest of the cast was
very adequate, notably Gregoretti's
splendid Cascart. Ischierdo's vocal re
serve was not sufficient to his need,
though his Dufresne was verr satis
factory on the whole. The orchestra
again, this year not by half so reliable
as usual, was In exceptionally good
mood for its work, and Mr. Steindorff,
also not lately In his usual form, Is at
his best In "Zaza."
To-night's hearing will be the last of
the opera and the season. And it
should not be forgotten that much
gratitude should be going to Mr. Stein
dorff and the management for giving
us thus the opportunity to hear this
work on its first hearing in America. :

A strange coincidence in the marriage
of both Lieutenant William R. Bettison
and Lieutenant Murphy is still the sub
ject of much comment among their
friends. Both officers were great chums
when they lived together at No. 11,
Presidio. Both became engaged at
the same time and confided the fact
to each other, but did not mention any
wedding day. Later the lieutenants
were assigned to different posts and
saw no more of each other, but on
October 17 both were married and tele
graphed the news as a surprise, where
upon congratulations were immediately
exchanged by wire. Lieutenant Mur
phy married Miss Virginia Nokes at
her home in this city, and Lieutenant
Bettison married Miss Marion Smyth,
daughter of Marrlot C. Smyth, at Hav
erford. Pa. The Rev. Herbert Shlpman,
chaplain of the United States Military
Academy at West Point, performed the
latter ceremony.
The following officers are in charge
of the arrangements: Lieutenant Camp
of th* cavalry, Captain Nance ol tua
cavalry, Major Todd of the artillery.
Captain Johnston of the artillery. Lieu
tenant Sypher of the artillery. Captain
Hinkley, adjutant, and one doctor from
the general hospital, to be elected by
the hospital.
I can assure you of a jolly dance, as
the new committee will spare no pains
In bringing congenial people together
and the martial music is something of
an inspiration In Itself.
The Presidio hops this winter will be

Willlar has come over from Sausallto
with her brother, Harry Willlar. and
will spend the winter months at the

Yesterday was a day of coming-out
teas. Miss Tallant was presented by
her aunt, Mrs. F. W. Tallant. Mrs.
John Paxrott entertained for her two
daughters. Miss Mary Emily Parrott
and Miss Abby Parrott. Mrs. Chese
brough gave the reception introducing
her own daughter and Miss Newell
Drown. Miss Newell Drown is one of
the handsomest of the winter buds,
but she is a very quiet girl and will
not devote herself to society as en
thusiastically as did her sister. Miss
BÂ«rnle Drown- Miss Lulu Bothin was
presented at a pretty tea given by Miss
Mau on Friday.
The coming out reception is a most
trying one to all concerned. Papa is
brave and pays the bills like a hero.
He even comes home early on the ap
pointed Saturday afternoon, dons his
frock clothes and takes his place in a
bower of blossoms and foliage with his
wife and daughter, all prepared to say
nice things to the callere when they
arrive. The mother of the debutante
may wear a gown as elegant as she
can persuade her husband to pay for
(but, of course, no more elaborate than
good taste will allow>, but the daugh
ter must be simplicity itself.
The custom of wearing white in Lon
don has been generally adopted here,
although any light color would be per
missible. The transparent lace yoke is
often made separately, to be removed
afterward, making the gown decollete
for evening wear. If the debutante is
a fluffy girl or a wild rose sort of beau
ty she may effect showers of sheer lace
and chiffon, but must strive to keep the
toilet as girlish as possible. She may
carry a bouquet chosen from among the
flowers sent her by her friends and ar
range the others as near her as possi
ble, never failing, of course, to be de
lightful when the sender appears. Fans
are not as frequent as flowers, but are
sometimes sent by devoted friends.
With all eyes upon her. the debutante
is inclined to be rather conscious- that
she is there, but if she will remember
that politeness is only kindness she will
be too busy to be ill at ease. As she
is presented to her mother's friends one
by one 6he will avoid stereotyped re
sponses to their words of greeting, but
Â¦will try to remember their names and
faces, find something in them to like
and be genuinely glad to see themâ as
pweet ar>d cordial to them as to Her
Intimate girl friends.
If the debutante is well bred, kind
hearted, sympathetic and thoughtful
for the comfort and happiness of others
her popularity is assured.
A! Ban Francisco girl who came out
at a ball winter before last not only
had a good time herself, but sought out
all of the older chaperons and found
tome one to talk to them and take
them to supper, that they might be as
happy as Ehe. "With so sweet a spirit
any girl would be a success and the
one to whom I refer has been remark
ably BO.
A girl used to make her formal debut
at a ball given for her, but now she is
almost invariably presented at a tea.
The invitations are issued in the name
of the father, mother and daughter
and Include their entire acquaintance.
In San Franciscoâ I regret to addâ the
list embraces many whom the ambi
tious mamma does not know. If she
has the merest bowing acquaintance
with some desirable people or has seen
their names at least three times in the
society column of a newspaper she
sends them a card. Sometimes this am
bition on the part of a devoted mother
to Introduce her daughter into wealth
ier circles only fastens an insatiable
love of extravagance and discontent on
the daughter. A disloyalty to old
friends and schoolmates is one of the
characteristics most frequently seen in
the ambitious girl.
It is Important that a debutante
should have an invitation to the promi
nent club dances, should have a box
during the opera season and should
have young men asked by her mother
to dine at the house, which places the
eligible under obligation to dance with
her and to call. All other courtesies
are extended to her by other hostesses.
Then let the debutante enjoy the
honor and pleasures that are extended
while she is young: and eager for the
social mysteries. There Is plenty of
time later on to be blase.
The autumn has brought a number of
buds Into the foreground of society and
their refreshing smiles and pretty
gowns xrlll brighten teas, luncheons
and balls during the winter season.
Debutantes In their gladdening pres
ence are the center of much interest,
and are constantly feted throughout
the season, but they drop Into oblivion
the next year with a regularity that
leads us to expect nothing else.
This oblivion is sometimes accounted
for by the fact that the debutante is
gxsest of honor at one function after
another, while in her second season it
is she who must lavishly entertain for
later buds, and that with great fre
quency. She becomes so satiated with
eoclety that the fame is not worth the
bills at the florists and the caterers.

\ NEW YORK, Nov. 21.âNotwith
standing the secrecy that has attended
the project, the news that experiments
In wireless telephony between ' battle
ships would be begun at the Brooklyn
Navy Yard this week was confirmed to
night. A. Frederick Collins, formerly
of Philadelphia, has obtained permis
sion, from the Navy Department to in
stall his experimental apparatus on the
battleships Kearsarge and Alabama.
These two vessels are ' now moored
about 150 yards apart at the Brooklyn
Navy, Yard. On Monday. Collins, will
erect telephone booths on each ship.
Collins says he has already had con
siderable success while working his
wireless telephone system over, a dis
tance of two miles, and is hopeful of
the outcome of his experiments on. the
battleships. If the apparatus yields sat
isfactory, results It will be Installed on
all vessels of the squadron that is about
to go to the West Indies for the winter
maneuvers. . ..' ,
Collins will work under the supervi
sion of Lieutenant Hudgins of the bat
tleship Kearsarge, one of the Navy De
partment experts in wireless telegra
phy. Wireles telegraphy has-been the
subject of several experiments In the
Navy Department, and several vessels
are equipped with apparatus, but wlre-
Ies telephony has not been tried In any
navy in the world.
About a year ago Collins, with a very
crude experimental apparatus, tried his
wlreles telephone on ferry-boats trav
ersing North River. Since then, he
says, he has so far perfected his ap
paratus that he has heard ; messages
distinctly, over a distance of two miles.'

President Marroquin has made the
following statement to the press In re
sponse to queries as to the political sit

"United States Minister Beaupre and
all Americans here are surrounded with
every guarantee for their safety. My
communications to the United States
Senate and to the people of the United
States make manifest tne attitude of
my government on the ques
tion. The situation in the interior of
the Colombian republic is quiet."
President Marroquin's reference to his
communication to the people of the
United States is explained by the fol
lowing address which he has given out:
"The President of Colombia to the
American People: The Colombian na
tion has Just been the victim of unex
pected aggression and is In danger of
losing the best part of its. territory. A
military movement, not popular senti
ment, was the origin of the proclama
tion of the independence of Panama.
"The American 'Government, which
always had been held by Colombia, to
be Its best friend and ally, prevented,
with marines, loyal militia from sub

origin, of the insubordination.

and of the American Minister here are
in open violation of that treaty.

According to Bach the books of the
company for March 3L 1302. show that
Watson charged himself with $100 000
to the credit of the capital stock.Un
til the books are explained in court,
says the New York lawyer, it will ap
pear that the President handled that
amount for two years after the Incor
poration. Watson also Is said to have
taken $420.000.of stock of the new con
cern -for his holdings in the old cor
poration.
WHJ-;RE THE PBOFTTS WUJJT.'
"We hope to show that these Hon
duras interests are valuable assets,"
Bach said. "It is our theory that Mr.
Watson spent his .. large profits from
Porter Brothers In such Investments as
this. The schedules which he has filed
In court may help us to secure much
money for the benefit of his creditors."
The Investigation thus far has devel
oped the fact that Watson had full
control of the business. John R. Adams
is said to have been treasurer of the
concern In name only, and to have
known nothing about the ' finances j of
the company. The bookkeepers also
protested , that they took Watson's
word for much that was entered In
the books.
When Attorneys Bach and Greenfield
took up Watson's own schedules to
day, the first item of indebtedness* they
saw was one for $50,000, due J. R.
Bleekman of New York. This creditor
holds $150,000 fn stock of a lumber
concern as security for his claim. At
torney Bach said this creditor offered
to* surrender his claim and security if
Watson would pay him $8000 and sur
render his interest In certain Honduras
enterprises.
CHICAGO, Nov. 21.â The Inter Ocean
will say to-morrow: Examination of
James Watson, ex-presldent of Porter
Bros.' Company, was continued before
Bankruptcy Referee Wean to-day, and
he will be held on Monday. Attorney
Albert Bach of New York, who has
been examining Watson for several
weeks past on behalf of Nelson R. Doe
of New York, former New York part
ner of the head of Porter Bros.' Com
pany, says:
"The evidence already introduced in
dicates that Mr. "Watson, as president
of Porter Bros.' Company, committed
some of the most colossal frauds ever
revealed in a bankruptcy court. Be
fore we get through with the case I
expect to have proved Mr. Watson's
guilt so conclusively that criminal pro
ceedings will be started against him
under the State and Federal statutes."
Watson is the witness whose eyes
failed him to such an extent that he'
could not give evidence from the books
. of tie concernâthe only evidence, he !
says, that can prore.what he did!,vr1th
the large sums of money handled by
the corporation. On account of the Â£b
i sence'of such evidence the J witness; has
not yet explained to the satisfaction of
opposing counsel how he disposed of
$1.SOO,000 said to have been received as
rebates from the Fruit Growers' Ex
press Company since 1896. This amount
was . credited .to the president \ on i the
books of the concern. The sum of
$1,069,000 was then debited to him,
leaving more than $700,000 to his credit.
HIS SALARY $10,000 A YEAR.
"As Mr. Watson. was receiving a sal
ary of only $10,000 a year," said Attor
ney Bach, "it Is difficult to see wherein
the company j owed him $700,000. He
therefore made a number of entries
which we believe to be fictitious, until
he had charged off this amount to
other accounts."
Watson has not made It clear to the
Investigators whether he loaned all the
"secret profits'* to the company. He
admitted several times that he had
kept part of the money himself. The
lawyers believe he kept most of it, but
the witness insisted in the early part
of the examination that he had paid
the corporation all that was due It.
Attorney Bach followed this contention
with a question whether the money
made in the business of Porter Bros,
did not belong to that concern.
"I did not think so," replied the wit

Hawcrth is the son of a farmer living

disposition and became a wandering
horse trader. While he was in Utah,
Thomas SandaJI. night watchman fn a

given the option of hanging or shooting;

EVIDENCE IS CraCT7MSTA2imAIil
The case against Haworth was based
largely en circumstantial evidence. The
watchman was found dead in the store,
evidently having been shot by a' bur
glar. HaTrorth was identified as having
been seen in the vicinity shortly before
the crime, and evidence was presented
to Indicate that he had tried to dispose
cf bloody clothing. Popular prejudice
ran high against him. He was tried in
Farmington, a small town close to the
scene of the crime, abour miiway be
tween Salt Lake ar.d Ogden, and there
was talk of a lynching. During the
trial Haworth made an attempt to es
cape, which intensiSed the feeling.
Haworth was arrested through the
ftld cf the Saa Francisco police, who, at
the request cf the Utah authorities,
traced him to Portland, where he was
taken into custody.
Senator Reed Smoot figured in obtain

Thomas Kearns were interested in the
case by Senator J. P. Dolliver of Iowa,
who, in turn, had had his sympathies

mother in Iowa.

COLON, Nov. 21.â Alfred Lebo, an
American who left Bogota on Novem
ber 6, reached Colon yesterday, bearing
messages from United States Minister
Beaupre to the State ' Department â¢ in
Washington. Lobo will ; sail for New
Vice Consul at Colon Felicitates the
New Republic.
FRANCE EXTENDS GREETINGS.
The Colombian newspapers express
the hope that the American press will,
help the cause of Colombia. It Is an
nounced that the entire country rejects
the Independence of the isthmus and
demands that the Colombian Govern
ment send troops to check the secession
movement.
Volunteers/without distinction of po
litical parties, are enrolling with enthu
siasm, and thf*. Liberal leaders, who
have been the enemies of President
Marroquin, have offered him their ser
vices.
Two popular meetings were called
to protest against the presence here of
the American Minister, but the Gov
ernment issued orders forbidding them
to be held.
A battalion of troops Is on duty at
the United States legation.
Public opinion here demands that
Panama be compelled to submit to the
government of Colombia, which will
then conclude a canal treaty with the
United States. The population of Bo
gota" is quiet and the newspapers of the
capital are calmly but , energetically
discussing the situation. . ,
"We hope that the United States will
apply the doctrines which it upheld
during the war of secession and not op
pose the right of Colombia to suppress
rebels and not recognize their belliger
ency. The United States, by its recog
nition of the Government of Panama,
would accept conditions almost similar
to those existing at the time of the sep
aratist mor^tient in the United States,
thus aggravating the circumstances
and violating the treaty, which obliges
Colombia to enter an earnest protest
against such action.
"Colombia considers that her, friend
ship with the United States has reached
such a state of disturbance as. to make
it Impossible for her to continue diplo
matic relations with the United States
unless the latter announces its-inten
tion not to interfere with Colombia's
action to suppress the rebels oh the
Isthmus and in not recognizing their
belligerency or -the revolutionary gov
ernment.

action of the United States was in con
trast with tha steps taken when Texaa
declared hÂ«r independence, and, he
said,' was not recognized by, the United
States until two years later. He re
ferred to the treaty of December 12,
1846, between the United States and
New Granada, quoting article 1; say
ing that the United States by Its action
toward the Colombian forces on the
Isthmus had clearly violated said ar
ticle. .
The Minister then quoted the Cnal
part of article S5 of the treaty of 1846
and said the obligation of the United
States to maintain neutrality and Co
lombian sovereignty was clear and
could not be misinterpreted. He after
ward referred to the other treaties be
tween the United States and Colombia,
asserted that the treaty of 1846 was in
force and that if the United Btates
Government doubted that the recogni
tion of the independence of Panama
was against this treaty and wished to
submit the point to the arbitration of
another power or to The Hague arbl
trational tribunal, Colombia would
willingly agree to It
The Foreign Minister next touched
upon the Civil War in the United States
and said:
"When England and France recog
nized the belligerency of the Confeder
ate States, American diplomacy was so
astonished that Mr. Seward would not
listen to the reading of the Instruc
tions received by the Ministers of those
powers because the Union was divided
into belligerent factions, declaring that
it was not admissible; and Mr. Adams,
the American Minister In London, said,
quoting a disptch previously addressed
to the American Minister at Paris:

Deputy Coroner Fennell testified that
he had examined the exploded boiler
and had found it badly encrusted with
scale and that the crownsheet and
other parts were very thin and weak,
and therefore dangerous. It was shown
also that the' boiler had lain out of
doors for several years unused and was
covered with moss and mold before
BIggo resurrected It and put It to use.

The Southern Pacific Company has de
cided to make a legal test of the right of
Assessor Dodge to separately assess the
company's ferry system between here and
Oakland and Alameda. Some months ago
the Assessor placed an appraisement upon
the ferry franchise of 57,500,000, and the
Assessor of Alameda County made a sim
ilar appraisement, it being Jointly
claimed by the officials of, the two bay
counties that the franchise was worth
115 000.000 and that the company should
pay a proportionate share of the assess
ment into the treasuries of the two coun
ties. "> j V
The railroad company, through its tax
agent. E. Black Ryan, opposed the as
sessment on the ground that the company
had no franchise for its ferries, but that
they are part of the franchise of the rail
road, which is annually appraised and
taxed by the State Board of Equalization.
The board recently fixed the assessment
of the* company, and it now proposes to
go to law with the Assessors.
On Wednesday it will make a tender to
the Assessor. of the taxes due upon its
realty within the county, and in the

WASHINGTON, Nov^ 21.â The State
Department has not yet been informed of
the result of General Reyes' mission to
the isthmus. Neither has Beaupre been
heard from, but there is no apprehension
on the score of his safety. It is believed
here that the principal object of General
Reyes' visit is to try to effect an adjust
ment of his country's troubles by secur
ing for the Colombian Government some
share of the money which the United
States, under the new treaty, will pay
to Panama.
It was said positively at the State and
Navy departments to-day that there was
no intention of reinforcing the naval
force in isthmian waters.

Panama are visiting Baltimore.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.â The Brit

In the fate of the bonds Issued by Co

Raikes, the British Charge here, had a
half hour's talk to-day with Secretary
Hay and it is believed that this sub
ject was touched upon.
The position of ' the' department, in
brief, Is that it cannot dictate to Pan
ama what disposition shall be made of
the money which is to be paid over by
the United States in consideration of
the canal right, but It certainly holds
that it is only right and Just that Pan
ama, In concluding a treaty of peace
with Colombia, shall make provision
for the assumption of a share of the
Colombian national debt; so it is ex
pected that the moral force of the de
partment will be exerted in that direc
tion.
AMSTERDAM, Nov. 21.â Two repre
sentatives of the Stock Exchange com
mittee called on the Foreign Minister
to-day and urged that the Government
of The Netherlands shall not recognize
the Government of Panama unless the
latter assumes a portion of the Colom
bian debt or surrendered to the Col
ombian bondholders a portion of the
money to be paid by the United States
under the Hay-Varilla treaty. The
Minister, in reply, refrained from com
mitting himself to any definite line of
action and the committee therefore de
cided to formally submit its views in
writing to The Netherlands Govern
ment. .

Britain Takes Up Question of Pana

On the following day Minister Rico
acknowledged the receipt of this note
and set forth that Colombia, wishing
to have the canal opened, signed a
treaty on January 22, 1903, . to consider
which the Colombian Congress was
called to meet in extraordinary ses
sion. The Government of Colombia,
he added, was notified also that the
United States would not admit modifi
cations of the measure, and that if it
were not approved friendly relations
between the two countries would be
compromised and the United States
Congress would take painful measures.
The treaty was sent to Congress with
this information. The Senate did not
approve of the treaty and appointed a
commission to study the best means of
satisfying the United; States Govern
ment without violating the constitu
tion.
Continuing, Minister Rico wrote that
Minister Herran Informed the United
States, Government on the 3d inst. that
the military at Panama had rebelled
and proclaimed the independence of
Panama, owing to the belief that an
other military force, arriving that day
at Colon, would be disarmed by the
Nashville's marine's, this intervention
preventing the re-establishment *of
constitutional order.
The Colombian Minister then said
the United States immediately after
ward entered into relations with the
rebels. Indicating that Colombia must
accept the situation or engage in a civ
il war, the action of the United States
also meaning that it would not allow
the Colombian Government to take
military measures to suppress the reb
els and reintegrate the nation. The
United States thus became the ally of
the rebels and severed her friendly
ties with Colombia.
Minister Rico then asserted that this

The following are extracts from the
recently exchanged notes between
United States Minister Beaupre and
Foreign Minister Rico. Beaupre wrote:
"I have received a cable message say
ing that the people of Panama as the
result of a popular movement have
broken the political treaties with Co
lombia, have assumed Independence by

that the governments of Colombia and
Panama arrive at a pacific and equita

AONPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.
Has it ever been your unhappy lot
to be told by your physician that you
must ko to a hospital and submit to
an operation? If bo, you remember
with what dread and shrinking you
awaited the day when you must endure
the knife.
The present day surgeon appears to
be possessed by a mania for operating,
especially In cases of hemorrhoids or
piles, and while the greater number of
the profession do not recommend this
"last resort" unless they honestly be-
lieve It necessary, the fact remains that
much needless operating Is done, and
the patient put to much expense and
suffering for what?
To obtain a possible temporary re-
lief; these words are used advisedly,
because in nine cases out of ten the
affliction returns and the patient is
Just where he started from, i Often-
times he could be cured much ' more
simply and easily by the use 'of such
a remedy as the Pyramid Pile Cure;
this has come to be recognized as the
best remedy on the market for
the painful disease named, and the
druggists now sell more of It than all
other pile remedies combined. .
The writer personally knows people
who were afflicted with the worst form
of bleeding and protruding piles : and
who were permanently cured by the
use of Pyramid Pile Cure. ' In every
one of these cases the attending phy-
Bician had assured the sufferer that
only by an operation could he rid him-
self of the disease; so much for the in-
fallibility of the doctors. v â¢ -. _ *
This remedy, which is Â¦ sold by all

' It is my experience as a specialist of 20 years. In the book I
tell how at last, I found a way to reach difficult, deep-seated dis-
. eases. Thirty years of earnest, ardent toll in hospitals and at
bedsides, made it possible for me to write these books.
The books tell how I perfected my prescription â Dr. Shoop's
Restorative. How by scientific experiment I traced out the
causes t'at bring on chronic diseases.
I found invariably where there waÂ»' a -weakness, that the in-
side nerves were weak. , .. " ,:
Where there was a lack of vitality, that .the vital nerves
lacked power.
Where weak organs were found, I always found weak- nerves. â¢
Not the nerves commonly thought of, but the vital organs
nerves. The inside â the invisible nerves.
This was a revelation.
. - Then my real success began.
Then I "combined Ingredients that would strengthen â that
would vitalize these nerves.
That prescription I called a restorative. It is known the

fall to cure one case in each hundred. In the extremely difficult

Can be Taken on Trial.
For a full month I will let you use it entirely at ray risk. ~ #
Send no money. Just write me for the book you need. When

anfl made the folio wing- signed statement:
"My indorsement of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp- Root cannot be written strong
enough. I had been greatly troubled with my kidneys and with what the
doctors termed inflammation of the neck of the bladder. Was obliged to pass
water very frequently day and night, often with smarting and burning. Some-
times ray back would get so lame and sore that I was almost helpless. I tried
several doctors and medicines to no good effect, when finally I heard that Dr.
Kilmer would send a sample bottle of his kidney medicine, Swamp-Root, free
by mail. I sent at once and received a sample bottle without delay. After
trying the sample I concluded it was just the medicine I needed, and I pur-
chased a liberal supply from my merchant and friend, Mr. E. J. Eslizer. To-
day I am a well man. and can ride horseback and drive with any of my
friends. I cannot Tecommend Swamp-Root too highly for what it has done
for me. You are at liberty to use this letter or refer any one to me, and I will
gladly tell them about my past troubles and what a wonderful remedy this
Swamp-Root is. I am very glad to recommend it to others at every opportu-

with good results. Yours very truly, &)fi~Yrt 7"*

of a telegram which was sent from Ha-
THAT JAI ALAI PRESENT.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.â The Senate
Military Committee continued Its in
vestigation to-day of the charges made
against General Wood.
Major Rathbone, who filed many of
the charges, was the first witness. He
was asked if he had given out state
ments concerning the inquiry, and ad
mitted that he had done so. He was
requested in the future to, consider
whatever took place inside the com
mittee room to be executive, and he
agreed to refrain from making public
any of the subsequent proceedings.
The committee decided that all extra
neous, irrelevant evidence should be ex
cluded. Hearsay testimony, even if
supported by documents known to be
on file at the War Depratment was
included in the matter ruled out,' as
well as that of the witnes who told
of the general impressions relating to
the acceptance of the gifts from the
Jai Alai company by General and Mrs.
Wood. In this connection much of the
evidence offered by Ernst Lee Conant
of the Havana office of a New York
law firm was ruled out. The methods
of procedure are those of a court of
justice, with the members of the com
mittee serving as court and jury.
BITTER FIGHT IN PROSPECT.
"If General Leonard Wood were on
trial for his life he would not receive
instructions from the court more favor
able than the rulings which have been
made by the Senate Military Commit
tee in the conduct of the present in
vestigation," said a member of the
committee to-night when asked con
cerning the methods used in detail with
the various witnesses examined.
It is believed that this evidence will
go before the Senate in executive ses
sion, and in the event of a decision by
the committee favorable to General
Wood the fight will be transferred to
the floor of the Senate. In fact, notice
of this has been given to a member of
the committee by one of the members
who joined in the protest against Gen
eral Wood's, confirmation to be a briga
dier general.

Committee Decision Favor
able to General Will
Not End Strife.
Judge Cleveland said that in view of
the conflicting forms of the decrees of
fered he would draw the decree him
self, giving all parties an opportunity
for a hearing on it if so desired during
the next week. /
Later in the day Mr. Bryan's attor
ney submitted to the court the form of
decree which they desired' entered.
After a statement that the will "Is ap
proved, allowed and ordered to be re
corded" this document declares that the
court finds that the envelope and the
letter which was within it are the
sealed letter referred to in section 12 of
the will, and that no undue Influence
was used, but that the court further
finds that the envelope and letter are
not proved to have been in existence at
the time of the execution of the will;
that the typewritten document which
Mr. Bryan offered was in evidence at
the time of the execution of the will;
that the letter contained in the envelope
was copied therefrom, but that the
typewritten document is not the sealed
letter referred to in section ' 2 of the
will; that the court therefore orders
that neither the letter nor the typewrit
ten document be admitted to probate,
without prejudice, however, to any
claim which may be hereafter made,
that they may be operative as a declar
ation of the trust mentioned in sec
tion 12 of the will, or otherwise.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 21.-The
inability of opposing counsel in the
case of the will of the late Philo S.
Bennett to agree on the form of the
formal decree to be entered In the Pro
bate Court proceedings was made man
ifest to-day when Judge Henry Stod
dard, as counsel for Mrs. Bennett, the
widow. 1 and other heirs, filed with
Judge Livingston W. Cleveland of the
court his draft of the form of the de
cree. With it Judge Stoddard submit
ted a note to the court saying that At
torney Hewitt of counsel for William J.
Bryan, the executor of the will, had
been unable to agree with him as to the
wording of the decree.
After Browne left the committee
room, Major. Rathbone resumed his
statement where he left off yesterday.
He was examined closely in regard to
his- charges that General Wood used
coercion and undue Influence with the
courts In getting instructions which
were unfavorable to Major Rathbone
on his trial in connection with the post
al fraud cases'. ' *
Secretary Root, in response to a re
quest i from the Military Committee,'
composed a report on the military rec
ord of General Wood. ; It is a strong
condemnation of that officer. The Sec
retary- reviews his career, pointing out
that he was first a line officer and then
became a 'surgeon. When a surgeon
he asked i arid obtained ' command of
troops I in the; Geronimo campaign-
Root appends letters of commendation
by General Miles and the late General
Lawton. He also - points out ' General
Wood's 'services -during the, Spanish
war. and calls attention to the fact that
he has been flve'tlmes named as a gen
eral v officer, i twice .as a brigadier : gen
eral of volunteers, once as a major gen
eral " of . volunteers, .Â« once as ' brigadier
general in the regular army and again
RATHBONE'S ACCUSATIONS.
Browne was questioned also in regard
to the charge that General Wood knew
the character of, the Jai Alai Company
when he argued in- favor of granting
It a concession to operate-
When reference tof this charge was
made by Browne, he was "asked by Sen
ator Cockrell to substantiate his asser
tion. He did so by directing attention
to official publications in Cuban news
papers, showing the nature of the Jai
Alal's establishment. The statements
included a j copy of the company's . by
laws and it was declared that these
had been suppressed by General Wood
In his statement to the War Depart
ment concerning the establishment.
The ground gone over by Browne Is
covered in the general statement of
charges filed with the company by Ma
jor Rathbone. It is expected Browne
will again be called before the investi
gation is concluded.
NEWSPAPEB MAN TESTIFIES.
Herbert J. Browne, a newspaper man;
who was in Cuba during the American
occupation, was called as a witness.
Brown told the committee that he had
obtained 'the affidavits made by, share
holders In the Jai Alai Company which
had been filed by Major Rathbone. In
the affidavits the shareholders declared
their stock had been assessed for the
purpose of paying the cost of the pres
ents which were given by the gambling
establishment to General and Mrs
Wood.
A request has been made that the
committee subpena a number of army
officers who served in Cuba with Gen
eral Wood, but thus far no action has
been taken by the committee In that
direction.
After much discussion the commit
tee ruled this testimony ouf of order.

vana to New York while the granting
of a concession to the establishment
was pending. The story of the tele
gram was told to Conant by G. K.
Childs, a shareholder in the Jal Alai.
He said that Pedro Galbls, secretary of
the establishment, went to New York
to purchase a silver dinner set for Gen
eral "Wood and while there was ordered
not to make the investment until no
tice of the granting of the concession
was printed in the official gazette of
Havana. The concession was granted,
a* telegram was sent to Galbis and, ac
cording to Conant, the purchase was
made at a cost of $5100.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â The Financier
this week says: The official statement
of the New York Associated Banks last
week showed a loss of 53,747,500 cash,
Instead of (720,400, the amount of loss
which was estimated upon the basis of
the traceable movements of money
during the week. This discrepancy of
more than $3,000,000 between the official
and the estimated loss cannot be ac
counted for even on the supposition
that it was due to the operation of the
average system. The assay office paid
during the week $1,112,419 for imported
gold, which payment was not Included
in the estimates; moreover, the whole
of the disbursement should, it would
seem, have been accounted for in cash
receipts by the banks, because the pay
ments were distributed throughout the
entire week. There was a transfer to
San Francisco on Friday of $500,000,
which did not appear In the estimates,
but this would count only for an aver
age of one day, or one-sixth of the
amount. The estimated loss in the pre
vious week showed a decrease of $4,266,-(
100 cash, while the official statement
indicated a reduction of $2,913,200. It is
quite possible, therefore, that some of
the loss in the week ending November
14 was brought over into last week,
thus partly accounting for the above
noted discrepancy of $3,000,000.
The deposits decreased $6,180,700 last
week, and the required reserve was
te^.eby reduced $1,520,425; deducting
ti\s sum from the loss of cash leaves
$2,227,075 as "the decrease in surplus re
sew e to $3,911,350. Computed upon the
basis of deposits less those of $36,810,100
of public funds, the surplus is $13,llli
625. Loans were decreased $2,620,700,
probably reflecting the average of calls
made late In the week and also the
liquidating of speculative accounts on
the Stock Exchange. Borrowing upon
sterling investments was most likely
not large enough to have an- offsetting
influence. Comparisons of loans with
the previous week show that six of the
larger banks reduced this item by
$400,000 net. Cash changes show a loss
by six banks of $3,800,000. Though the
surplus reserve of the benks is low,
this fact should cause no concern.
Doubtless in the' current week the
greater part of the $6,000,000 gold now
in transit will arrive, and payment
therefor should be reflected in the bank
statement.

NAVAL OFFICER
EARNS CENSURE
his command to throw up hands, it
slipped 'from his face and Crews, like
Mayfield, got a good look at him.
"Throw up your hands and be quick,"
shouted the boy in an excited tone of
voice. Seeing that his man did not com
ply readily, he repeated the word
"quick" many times and came nearer
and nearer with the revolver. His hand
commenced to tremble like a leaf and
the first wbrd Crews spoke to him was
a word of 'caution that the weapon
might go off. Then, when he called
on the conductor to "cough up," the
latter laughed and started for the
dummy. He called to the gripman,
James McElwaln', "Jim, there Is a fel
low out here trying to rob me. Stop
the car."
McEIwain, thinking that Crews was
joking with him, turned and asked him
if he had the nightmare. Crews then
pointed to the rear platform, and'pas
sengers and carmen beheld the robber
standing there, speaking words that
could not be distinctly heard, but
with the grin leveled at the conductor.
As 'McElwaln. released the grip and
threw on the breaks the bandit Jumped
friith the car and started to run across
a vacant lot.
In telling of his experience, Crews
said that he had been a soldier and
had seen too many guns to yield up -to
a "kid," as he termed the highwayman.
He has been ln the employ of the road
for about fifteen years and Is regarded
as one of its most careful and trust
worthy employes. He carried about
$15 in his pocket at the time of the
"affair. Si^'il'vifi. â¢
DESCRIBE BOBBEB.
Both conductors agree upon the de
scription of the boy. They say he is a
little over five feet five Inches in height,
about 18 years of age and has a brown
complexion. His face Is beardless and
his mouth droops at the corners. He
wore a dark suit of clothing and a
black soft hat. The color of his eyes
neither noted, but they could recognize
him If they ever saw him again.
The detectives are confident of a cap.
ture. They regard the bandit as a no
vice and believe that he â¢will attempt
work of this or some other sort soon
again. That he Is a coward and afraid
to shoot is evinced in the last hold-up.
This "will probably lead to an easy cap
ture should he ever j be confronted by
another man Â¦who possesses the game
ness of Conductor Crews. .',0
Whether the bandit of last night Is
the one who held up the Hayes street
car at Its Stanyan street terminal a
few nights ago is hard to tell, but In
many particulars the descriptions
agree, although the crew of the last
mentioned car did not have an oppor
tunity to view the bandit's face. The
police of the Golden Gate Park Sta
tion began a comprehensive search Im
mediately after last night's robberies,
â¢with orders to pick up all suspicious
characters. The police have a theory
that there might be two robbers oper
ating together, though both conduc
tors saw but one.

INSISTS ON GETTING GOLD.
The bandit took the' money with his
left hand and held the revolver on the
conductor with his â¢ right. He leaned
against the rear of the car to balance
himself and seemed, perfectly calm.
Finally Mayfield emptied his pockets
and told the robber so. The latter ap
parently \ did not believe him, for he
shoved the gun within an inch of the
conductor's face and demanded all the
gold he had. Mayfleld replied that he
haTno gold, but the man of the road
was insistent. At length he was made
to believe, and still holding the gun,
gave Instructions regarding the man
ner of his escape. -* : \ v
In each case the mask worn by the
robber slipped from his face, revealing
his features and making his capture
and identification almost certain. Ac
cording to both conductors he is not
more than 18 years of age.
It. was shortly after 10 o'clock when
car 251 of the McAllister line approach
ed Fifth avenue and Fulton street on
its "trip downtown. There was no. pas
sengers inside the ; car, although five
occupied seats on the dummy. Con
ductor Mayfleld was standing- on- the
rear platform and noticed the boy
swing on, grasping the railing with his
left hand. As he did "so he stumbled
and the conductor "reached forward to
assist him. "When the boy had regain
ed his footing he quickly raised a re

and placed It near the" railroad, man's

Conductor Mayfield was startled by
the appearance of the robber. The lat

concealing it below the eyes. He seem
ed determined for, at . the railroad
man's hesitation, he again uttered the
command. .. .' .
"Don't be in a-hujry," said Mayfleld,
'Twill get it for you all right." Then
Mayfleld "dug" down into his pockets
and drew out all the money he had.
The robber watched the operation with
Interest and pocketed coin after coin as
fast as it was handed to him. While
so doing his mask slipped down, re
vealing his entire face. He replaced
the mask with an oath, but the con
ductor had noted his features and was
able to describe them to the police. .
A mere boy, in the guise of a bandi*.
held up two street cars in the neigh
borhood of Golden Gate Park last
night Armed with a big revolver and
with his face obscured' by a mask, he
first leveled his revolver upon Conduc
tor Arlington R. Mayfleld of car 251 of
the McAllister street line while the car
was in motion and there were five pas
sengers on the dummy. As a reward
for his daring he secured about $20,
and, leaping to the ground, disappeared
in the darkness.
Encouraged by his success as a
knight of the road, the boy bandit .was
soon â¢ heard of again. This time he
poked Conductor James Crews of Geary
street car No. 352 in the ribs with his
revolver and demanded what coin the
carman had in his possession. Crews
showed remarkable courage. Instead
of complying with the request to throw
up his hands he laughed in the muzzle
of the ugly-looking weapon and started
toward the dummy to call the assist
ance of the gripman and three passen
gers. For a time the young bandit fal
tered on the car, his revolver still
pointed at the conductor and his hand
shaking like a leaf. Then he took to
his heels and started across a vacant
lot.

SETTLEMENT OF ACHE
DISPUTE IS COSTLY
Ex-Mayor Perry heard of the war
rant issued against him and wandered
into police headquarters and gave him
self up. State Senator Burns and ex-
Alderman Kinney came in next. They
were in the custody of officers.

for. Prosecutor Ward went to work at
once uoon the leverage offered by the
incomplete statement and secured
enough additional evidence so that
Palsbury was summoned again last
right for a conference. The result, the
prosecutor says, was a. statement which
is regarded as complete.
It has developed that Salsbury's first
confession, made last week, was not so
complete as the prosecution had hoped
Following are those Indicted: Former
Mayor George R. Perry. State Senator
David Burns, Corey P. Blssell, former
member of the Board of Public Works,
and the following ex-Aldermen, who
â¢were In office when the attempt was
made to put the water deal through:
James McColl, Peter. Depagter, Jacob
Ellen. M. Kinney. John T. Donovan,
Jacob Mot, Abraham Ghysels. Charles
Johnson. Ryner Stonehoase, Daniel Lo
zier. John McLachlan. Clark Elocum.
John Muir and Adrian Shriver. The
amounts the respondents are charged
with having received out of the alleged
boodle fund range from 5200 to $3333.
The revelations of the morning in the
service of the warrants show that the
Common Council was controlled during
the attempt to put through the water
scheme with the fourteen votes, which
included both Democrats and Republi
cans. The Aldermen are charged v.ith
having received J300 to J500 each. Mayor
Perry's share, it is charged in the war
rant, was $3333. and Bissell is charged
â¢with receiving $500. while Senator
Burns is alleged to have received $200
for his support.

"Warrants were issued to-day for sev
enteen former city officials charging
them Â¦with accepting a bribe in connec
tion with the famous Gannan-Cameron
scheme for supplying the city with
water from Lake Michigan. All of the
warrants are the result of the confes
sion made by former City Attorney
Salsbury on his return last week from
serving a two years' term in the De
troit House of Correction for breaking
the Federal banking law in connection
with the scheme. While in prison Sals
bury's conviction on a bribery charge
in the State courts in connection with
the same matter was affirmed by the
Supreme Court of the United States,
and with the prospect of being returned
to prison Salsbury went to the prose
cutor's office and made a lengthy con
fession, which resulted in to-day's is
suance of warrants.

erators for a settlement of the strike In

OMAHA, Nov. 21.â Major General
John C. Bates, commanding the De
partment of the Lakes and Missouri,
to-day turned over the Department of
Missouri to its new commander, Major
General SL S. Sumner. Nearly all the
officers in the Department of Missouri,
Including Major Smith Van Leo, chief
engineer of the department at Fort
Leavenworth, were present. No imme
diate change in the personnel of thÂ«
staff will occur and Major F. J. Mc-
Clernand will remain as chief of staff.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.â Major Gen
eral Bates, commanding the Depart
ment of the Lakes, has been ordered by
the War Department to proceed to Den
ver to Investigate the labor troubles,
with a view to ascertaining if there is
any necessity for Federal troops there.
It is stated at the War Department
that Major General Bates is not going
to Denver to relieve Brigadier General
Baldwin of his command of the De
partment of the Colorado. The purpose
of hiÂ« visit Is to look over the field, to
advise Governor Peabody, if he cares
to have such advice, and, finally, to re
port to the department here, and,
through it, to the President, as to the
actual need that may exist for the use
of United States troops in connection
with the Colorado strike. In addition
to his experience Jn the Philippines,
General Bate" is regarded as an expert
in ' the settlement of vexatious ques
tions growing out of conflicting civil
and military authority.
Sends General Bates to Report TJpon
Colorado Situation.
WAE DEPARTMENT ACTS.
CHICAGO. Nov. 21. âThe street car
strike has settled down, for the time
being at least, to a bargaining propo
sition. Negotiations have been in pro
gress all day and will continue through
to-morrow. The result to-night is that
the company has presented an answer
to the last proposition of the men,
which makes some concessions In the
matter of routine cars, but does not
grant anywhere near what the men
have been demanding.
The last conference or the day termi
nated at 3 o'clock and the union offi
cials left the room with displeasure on
their faces and evidently not In the
best of humor. They went at once to
the office of Attorney Prentiss, one of
their advisers, to formulate a reply to
the answer of the company. This will
be submitted to-morrow and the com
pany will make another reply.
The conference this afternoon was at
times somewhat heated and the voices
could be heard in the outer hall as
they argued the propositions involved.
"When President Mahon of the street
car men's organization came out of the
meeting he would make no statement,
and Colonel Bliss, the attorney of the
company, would only say:
"We have Just been discussing how
to run a street railway."
Attorney Prentiss said after 'he had
reached his office and was about to lock
himself up with the officials of the
union:
"There is no Immediate chance of a
settlement. I hope that we can reach
an agreement, but nothing has been ac
complished yet."
The present hitch in negotiations is
understood to be over the routing of
cars, the men having waived their de
mand for the exclusive employment of
union men and their right to pass with
authority upon the discnarge of em
ployes. On the question of wages there
haB never been any trouble, both sides
having been willing from the nrst to
submit that question to arbitration.
A ureat mass meeting of union men
is to be held to-morrow at Tattersalls
to discuss the strike.
The associated teaming interests of
this city, which organization counts
among its membership nearly all the
large business houses and manufactur
ing concerns that operate teams, has
served notice upon the Teamsters' Un
ion that unless the teamsters return to
their work with the Chicago City Rail
way Company all agreements held with
local teamsters' unions will be abro
gated. The notice was sent to Corne
lius O'Shea, international president of
the teamsters, by Robert J. Thorne,
chairman of the executive committee
of the teaming interests. The team
eters will hold a meeting to-morrpw to
decide upon a plan of action. . .

It is expected the boxer and the man

Superintendent McCormick was one
of the best known mining men In the
Cripple Creek district.
After receiving news of the explosion
Governor Peabody ordered the troops
In Cripple Creek who were to proceed
to Telluride to-night to remain In Crip
ple Creek. The force now there num
bers nearly 400. .*â¢
Major Naylor and a detail of soldiers
were dispatched from Camp Goidfield
to the mlna and took charge of the
property. No one is allowed to ap
proach the mine and no one is permit
ted to leave.
To the trigger of the revolver waa
attached a string, which was thrown
across the thaft in such a manner that
when the cage came down and encoun
tered the string the revolver would ex
plode, the bullet striking the explosive.
Pieces of this revolver have been recov
ered from the bottom cf the shaft, but
not a vestige of the infernal machine
can be found.
The explosion occurred while Super
intendent McCormick and Miner Beck
were descending into the mine on the
stage. They were the only passengers.
Just as the stage reached the sixth
level the explosion occurred. It wrecked
the level, cage and shaft at that point
and instantly killed both men. The ex-,
plosion was heard at the surface and
many persons thought It was an earth
quake. The engineer hastily reversed
the hoist, but could not pull up the
cage.
The bodies of McCormick and Beck
%vere recovered and brought to the sur
face through the second compartment
of the shaft this afternoon. It is be
lieved no other men were killed or in
jured. Â¦ .
It is positively asserted by officers of
the Vindicator Mining Company, that
the explosion was caused by an infer
nal machine. This statement was made
after a thorough examination of the
shaft. The infernal machine, contain
ing many pounds of dynamite, was
placed in the sixth level, which Is part
of the abandoned workings of the mine,
within a few inches of the shaft. Then
a loaded revolver was fixed in the
shaft, with its barrel pointing directly
toward the infernal machine.
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., Nov. 2Lâ
Charles McCormick, superintendent of
the Vindicator mine, and Melvin H.
Beck, a miner, were killed . shortly be
fore noon to-day by an explosion in the
sixth level of the Vindicator mine.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 2Lâ Three hun

the cars all night, making their camp
on Monday morning.

BUDAPEST, Nov. 21.â In the lower
house of the Diet to-day Premier Tisza,
replying to the speech of the Austrian
Premier, Baron von Koerbcr, in the
Reichsrath yesterday, said that the
Austro-Hungarian . ausgleich did not
exist. The Austrian law differed in
many points from the Hungarian aus
gleich law, but the common affairs of
the halves of the monarch were man
aged on the basis of the provisions of
the Austrian law. Count Tisza declared
that an exclusively Hungarian law
modifying the common affairs had in
any, case the force of law. The asser
tion that Hungary desired to prejudice
the principle of parity between the two
states was a "misrepresentation of
facts."
Tlsza Declares in a Speech. That Aus
tro-Hungarian Ausgleich Did
Not Exist.

SANTA ROSA. Nov. 21.â As a result
of the storm which has been ragirg
in this vicinity for three days past, the
Southern Pacific evening passenger
train came near being ditched yester
day on its return to this city.
The tracks near Schellville were un
der-water and the flood water stretched
out for a great distance on either side.
Engineer George B. Clark ran into tbe
water and suddenly his engine lurched
and seemed to settle. He applied the
air quickly, but the rails being wet the
locomotive slid along until it ran on to
solid ground and righted itself. Great
consternation occurred among the pas
senger? in the coaches when they fol
lowed the engine into the depression.
No one was injured.
Numerous landslides and washouts
are reported, the most serious one^je
ir.g near Occidental. Fully an acre of
earth fell from a hill there during the
rain yesterday morning and blocked
trafflc. Mail Carrier Frank Smith did
not reach" this city until noon to-day,
whereas his schedule calls for his ar
rival here Friday evening at 6 o'clock.
The landslides and washouts were re
sponsible for his delay.
When he discovered the slide near
Occidental Smith essayed to reach this
city by another road, but found it in
worse condition than the first one.
Reaching the laguna west of this city
this morning he was unable to cross
that stream and was compelled to re
turn and come around through Sepas
topol. He departed on his arrival here
at once for Occidental, his schedule
calling for a round trip daily. It is not
certain that he will be able to make
the journey, as other slides may have
taken place.
Creeks and streams all over the coun
ty are running brimful and doing con
siderable damage. A large hulkhead In
Santa Rosa Creek has been torn loose
by the force of the water. The water
was so high in the vicinity of the Napa
line of the Southern Pacific Railroad
that it was necessary to annul two
trains on that branch to-day.
ETNA, Nov.' 21.â A big storm, in the
Salmon River mountains flooded Scott
Valley, Siskiyou- County. The United
States mall coach from Etna to Yreka
tipped over in Kldder Creek and the
stage driver and one passenger nar
rowly escaped drowning. The mail and
express were recovered. It has been
raining since November 5.
REDDING, NoV. 21.â This region la
experiencing a wonderful storm. Rain
has fallen steadily for seventy- two
hours. , The precipitation for that pe
riod measures eight and a half inches.
The stage from Biebery Lassen County,
due here last evening, has not yet ar
rived. , The stage from Weavervtlle,
Trinity County, managed to get in last
night, although late, by selecting . a
new route to escape" the storm. The.
rainfall for the season is fourteen
inches.
The passenger train from Portland to
San Francisco, due here at 10:30 in the
morning, did not arrive until noon. It
Is learned that for an hour It was held
by a landslide two miles north of Kes
wick.
; NAPA, Nov. 21.â A heavy rain fell
Friday and Friday, night and the Napa
River is out of its banks at present.
The water was over, the railroad track
near Yountvflle yesterday. The rain
fall for twenty-four 1 hours up to,; 7
o'clock, this; morning was .1.45. This
makes a total for the season to date of
Special Dispatch to The- Call.
The rainfall throughout the State was
much lighter yesterday than on Fri
day and last evening: the indications
were that a g-eneral clearing up was
close at hand. The rivers in the north
ern half of California were somewhat
higher than normal, but there is no
danger of an overflow anywhere at
present. Professor ilcAdie of the
Weather Bureau stated last night that
the storm was going slowly east. No
rain fell in the south. Tne average
rainfall in the State yesterday was
about a quarter of an incn. During the
entire storm 2.80 Inches of rain fell in
San Francisco. The weather is grad
ually becoming warmer and the winds
are very light.

But the temptation when giving news of the piano store is Kreat. The business
is big. Couldn't be otherwise with the great combination of pianos from tne fac-
tories of the best makes.
There is a vast deal of trading and renting going on in the piano business.
Strictly speaking, a piano that has been rented is not new. ,-Â»
Neither Is a piano that has been used ever so little.

ments that are not necessarily old for others that are younger.
Families that have used a piano for a long time need a new one and trade the
old one in making the purchase.
" In 'a piano business such as now current here, the number of traded pianos
that must be sold at off-prices Is very large.
We cannot, however, afford to be discredited by selling even aa underpriced
and formerly used piano if unsatisfactory, and before offering such they are put
through a thorough process of reconstruction that In most instances makes them
good as new.

BERLIN, Nov. 21.â The* claim made
by Dr.Mamorek that Professor Mikul
icz of Breslau University had experi

covered by the former with results
proving the healing powers of the se
rum is incorrect. The Breslauer Zel
tung has interviewed Professor Mikul

â¢had been experimenting with Dr. Mam
orek's serum for seven weeks at the
university surgical clinic on patients
having various forms of â¢ external ; tu
berculosis, carefully following "Dr.
Mamorek's directions.' Most . of . the
cases treated, he said, showed no signs
of Improvement, though in a very few
cases slight ~ improvement was noted.
The professor, doubts, however, wheth

ment. The experiments will continue

During Captain Brown's residence at
the lighthouse he 'and his assistants
saved forty lives. Some were saved
from capsized boats, some from
wrecked ships. In October, 1874, when
the Rescue went upon the rocks,
nine men were saved by Captain Brown
and his assistants. The last rescue of
note was in 1895 when several men were
brought ashore from the wrecked
steamer Samson. Â»"/ - >'
The wife of Captain Brown survives
him.
Captain Brown was 70 years old. He
! came to California when a very young
! man. He entered the civil service and
! in 1ST2 was appointed keeper of Point
\ Bonita lighthouse by T. B. Shannon,
then Collector of the Port. From that
time until his retirement from the ser
vice about two years ago he kept a
constant vigil from the bleak height of
Point Bonita.
Captain Brown had been ailing for
several years. On July 1, 1901, he re
signed from the lighthouse service and
took up his residence in Sausalito.
Ever since his resignation Captain
Brown had steadily though slowly
failed in health. The end came this
morning.

neers of California and for over thirty
years keeper of Point Bonita light
house, is dead.
Special DUpatch to The Call,
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 21.â A dispatch
from Washington states that Senator
Perkins has prepared and will, soon in
troduce a bill to move the quarantine
station from its present location on
ground wanted by the Navy Depart
ment to a new site near the jetty and
outside the harbor entrance. The bill
carries an appropriation of $50,000. The
purpose is to get quarantine away so
that the Navy Department can have
plenty of room for the training sta
tion which will be located here and for
the establishment of which $200,000 has
been laid aside out of the naval appro
priation bill.
Some years' ago. before the Navy De
partment thought it would want or
need a coaling station here, the depart
ment transferred the present quaran
tine site, together with 61% acres ad
ditional, to the Treasury Department,
and now finds that it is the most exact
portion that a training station cannot
get along without. When the bill ia
passed the Navy Department will have
a half-mile of water front just north
of the military reservation on the point.

CARSON CITY. Nev., Nov. 2Lâ
Cochle Segmiller, a 16-year-oM Indian
boy, has been brought to this city and
placed in the keeping of Warden John
C. Considine of the Nevada peniten
tiary. He is under sentence to be
h&rged on January 23, 1904, for the
murder of Â¦William Williams at the In
dian Creek ranch, about two months
ago. His was the first death sentence
ever pronounced in Lincoln County and
his execution will be the first in Ne
vada for nearly twenty years.
The young Indian and Williams had
trouble over a debt of $5. Soon after
the difficulty Williams fell asleep in a
chair. The Indian secured a rifle and
ehot his victim through the back, kill
ing him instantly. After replacing the
rifle where he had secured it the mur
derer went to the I^as Vegas ranch,
forty-five miles distant. Two ranchers
tracked his horse and captured the In
dian soon afterward. Ke admitted the
killing and pleaded guilty, thinking,
he says, that the Judge would do noth
ing with him. The sentence of death
followed.
Williams was an aggressive man and
had much trouble with the Indians. At
the time of his death the officers had
a warrant for his arrest for being Im
plicated in a shooting affray that took
place in one of the southern counties
â¢orne ti=e ago.

TACOMA, Nov. 21.â Mayor R. P. Mc-
Lennan sailed Into Dawson October 31
amid the unbroken mass of running ice
and completed the most rapid and sen
sational runs ever made from White
Horse to Dawson in a craft without
steam. The Mayor came In a house
boat and brought with him two brides
and their chosen mates, and others
swelling the number in the party to
sixteen.
The run was made from White Horse
in five days. Considering the fact that
the last three days of the run, from
Selkirk down, was made amid masses
of running ice the time and the success
of the craft are remarkable. The scow
ran day and night and was not
aground, once. Numerous steamboats
and scows were passed hard aground
at different places because of low
water. The scow was covered and in
closed in true houseboat style and
manned by six sturdy men engaged
especially for the trip.
The term "co-operative craft" might
be appropriately applied in reference to
the scow. It was bought and outfitted
at White Horse by ten men, including
the Mayor. The interior was supplied
with bunks, mattresses, tables, stoves
and other living accommodations. The
craft was escorted from White Horse
to the Yukon crossing by the steamer
Casca, and from the crossing made the
run to Dawson alone..
One of the newly married couples
was Mr. and Mrs. Van Curren of Los
Angeles. Van Curren will engage in
business in Dawson. Mr. and Mrs.
Lamb of Sulphur were the other newly
wedded people.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that charcoal 1Â» the
eaf#ft and most efficient disinfectant and puri-
fier In nature, but few realize Its value when
taken into the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more you take
of It the better; It Is not a drug at all. but
eln-.ply attcrbs the gases and lmprrlties al-
ways crercnt in the stomach and Intestines
snd carries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after smoking,
drinking or after eating onions and other odor-
ous \t-K?tables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Improves the
ccrcplexlct. It whitens the teeth' and further
acts as a natural and eminently eaf t cathartic.
It LtÂ»>orbÂ« the Injurious gasea which collect
In the stomach and bowels; It disinfects the
mouth and throat .from the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one form or an-,
othtr, but probably the best charcoal and. the
most for the money Is" In Stuart's Absorbent
Lozenges; they are composed of the finest pow-
dered Willow charcoal and other harmless an-
tiseptics in tablet form or rather in the form
of large, pleasant tasting lozenges, the charcoal
being mixed with honey."
The daily use of these lozenges will soon
tell in a much Improved condition of the gen-
eral health, better complexion, sweeter breath
and purer blood, and the beauty, of It is that
no possible harm can result from their con-
tinned use, tut. on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of the bene-
fits of charcoal says: "I advise Stuart' Â¦ Ab-
sobent Lozenges to all patients suffering from
gas In stomach and bowels and to clear the
complexion and ourlfy the breath; mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver Is greatly bene-
fltted by the dally use of them; they cost but
twenty-five centi a box at drug e tores, and al-
though in some sense a patent preparation,- yet
I believe I get more and better < charcoal . In
Stuart's Absorbent . Lozenges than. In any of
the ordinary charcoal tablet*.

It was learned that when Treasurer
McDougald was about to assume office
two years ago he was ready to furnish
a personal bond in the sum of $100,000,
but Mayor Phelan. who was then in
office, insisted that McDougald furnish
a bond of a surety company. Phelan
had in mind the defalcation of former
Treasurer Widber when he exacted a
surety bond from McDougald. The lat
ter could find nothing In the charter
requiring the giving of a surety bond,
but complied with the wishes of Phe
lan in that regard, and gave a surety
bond which costs him ?500 yearly.
The charter appears to make the ap
proval of an official bond by the Mayor
and Auditor purely a ministerial affair.
The provision in section 3. article 16,
of miscellaneous matters refers espe
cially to personal sureties, as follows:
"Sec. 3. City and county officers shall
rot be accepted as surety for each
other on official- bonds. Every bond
shall contain a condition that the prin
cipal will faithfully perform all official
duties then, or that may thereafter be.
WANTED SUBETY BOND.
Dodge was recently notified that the
premium on his bond for the same
amount would be 5200 yearly, or 5800
for the term of four years. This
amount is exactly double the sum here
tofore paid by Dodge in premiums.
Dodge rebels at this exorbitant rate
and will escape its payment by secur
ing two citizens who are well able
financially to Insure the city against
any financial loss it might possibly
sustain through any action on his part.
The reoent combine formed by the
surety companies to raise the premiums
on bonds furnished by city officials
caused Assessor Dodge to declare yes
terday that he will file a bond with
personal sureties to cover his term be
ginning January 8 next.
The exaeifans of the surety concerns
have become so burdensome that it is
likely that other city officials will fol
low suit, and result in a considerable
loss of premiums to the companies.
Assessor Dodge is required by the
charter to furnish a bond In the sum
of $50,000. During the last four years
Dodge has paid to a surety company
which qualified on his official bond the
sum of 5100 yearly as a premium.
Dodge has therefore paid out 5100 for
the protection guaranteed by the surety
company.
"Sec 4. Every surety upon an offi
cial bond, other than lawfully autho
rized surety companies, must make an
affidavit, which shall be Indorsed upon
such bond, that he is a resident and
freeholder in the city and county and
worth in property situated in the city
and county, exclusive of incumbrances
thereon, double the amount of his un
dertaking over and above all sums for
which he is already liable or in any
manner hound, whether as principal,
indorser or surety, and whether such
prior obligation or liability be condi
tional or absolute, liquidated or unliqui
dated, due or to become due. All per
sons offered as sureties on official
MUST MAKE AFFIDAVIT.
Imposed upon or required of him by
law, ordinance or this charter, and that
at the expiration of his term of office he
will surrender to his successor all prop
erty, books, papers and documents that
may come into his possession as such
officer. Such bond must also be exe
cuted by two or more sureties, who
shall each Justify in the amount re
quired for said bond; but when the
amount of the bond Is more than $5000
the sureties may become severally lia
ble for portions of not less than $2500.
When there are more than two sureties,
such sureties may justify in an amount
which, in aggregate, shall equal
double the 'amount of said bond.
NAPA, Nov. 21.â At a meeting of the
board of managers of the Napa State
Hospital, held Thursday night, the po
sition of steward, held by J. M. Palmer,
was declared vacant and ex-Postmas
ter Friend of Oakland was elected to
the place.
Palmer, though a Democrat, held the
position for the past twenty-eight
years, through Republican and Demo
cratic regimes alike, and has always
beÂ«n regarded an honest and capable
official. The removal is made now to
make rcom for a Republican, which
Friend Is. The change has been under
consideration, for some time, but until
the last meeting Palmer had the sup
port of enough votes on the board to
prevent removal.
At the f e-sslcn of the board held yes
terday Charles Poole was removed
from the position of engineer and J.
McDonald of San Francisco was elected
to the place. Both changes have caused/
considerable comment in Napa.
The woman at first swore that Hulsa
and a third man aided Outlaw McKln
ney in the fatal battle. Later she de
clared in a newspaper interview that
she had perjured herself and said
Hulse was not present.
The prosecution to-day devoted most
of its efforts to the impeachment of
Ed Potter and John E. Caldwell, who
swore to an alibi for Hulse yesterday.
Charles Badger, an electrical lineman,
testified that he saw Hulse a few min
utes after the shooting when the two
witnesses declared he was in their
company. Badger, however, said he
was alone. George Carlisle, a street
car motorman, saw Potter and Hulse
In conversation the morning of April
19, but it was about an hour before the
shooting. " :
William Forker, superintendent for
the Jewett & Blodgett Oil .Company,
was on Chester avenue about 10 o'clock
and saw officers going toward the joss
house * before the battle. Hulse was
then on Chester avenue, but five min
utes later he was gone. David Scott
saw Hulse on Chester avenue between
9 and 10 o'clock, but a few minute3
afterward he "was gone! Scott was on
watch by the Crawford saloon, where
Hulse claimed to have been until the
fatal battle. He was not there during
this period.- John Collins was around
the Crawford ! saloon during the en
tire iime the defendant claimed to be
there, but did not see anything of him.
' BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 21.â The evi
dence In the Hulse case closed this
evening without either Jennie Fox or
Hulse himself, the only living eye-wit
nesses to the details of the tragedy, un
less, indeed, there was a third man Im
plicated, taking the stand.

COLUSA, Nov. 21.â A- strange young
man stepped up to the Constable at
Maxwell yesterday and said:
â¢ .' A couple of fellows have planned to
rob a saloon and a store In this town
and they have forced me to agree \to
help them, and we are to do the Job
to-night. I will be with them, so If
you lay for them don't shoot me. They
will first enter Tolson's saloon. They
already have keys to fit the door."
Constable Carpenter Immediately'se
cured % other officers and last night they
secreted themselves In Tolson's saloon.
After waiting: until nearly 2 o'clock and
when about ready to leave they heard
footsteps, then a key slipped into the
lock and the door was opened.
The burglars went to work on the slot
machine when they were surprised by
thW" officers and after a hard fight one
of the robbers was shot in the legs arid
captured. The other was captured this
afternoon at Colusa Junction and
lodged In the County Jail at Colusa.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO, Nov. 21.â Jack Anderson,
the noted vaquero, was drowned to-day
while attempting to cross a tributary
to Eel River. Anderson had been to
Covelo, having come here. early in the
day. The heavy rains hadswollen the
waters, and about 4 o'clock, when he
started for home and came to the river,
he found it verv high.
At first he dared not attempt to cross,
but after considering for some time he
concluded to make the attempt. His
horse seemed to swim and breast the
water bravely, but when he reached
the center of the stream he failed and
horse and rider went down. The horse
came out 200 yards' below, but the rider
was seen no more alive.
Scores of Indians and whites have
been searching for the body and late
this evening it was found on a drift
some two miles from where the acci
dent occurred.
Anderson was considered a brave
among the Indians and a great pow
wow will follow mourning and dancing
for the repose of his soul. "

United States Steel has been affected
also by the discontinuance of the pro

toward tfce creation of a security, of the

The opinion is now growing that funds
may become plethoric In New York by
the turn of the new year.
On the Industrial side attention has
been centered on the iron and steel
trade and the affairs of the United
States Steel Corporation. Advices from
the trade show continued uncertainty
as to customers taking hold at the
price reductions already effected : and
an expectation that the decline In
prices Is likely to extend. The reduc
tion In export steel freight ra^es ac
corded by the railroads, while prom
ising to facilitate the export trade, is
looked upon as concrete evidence of
poor prospects for domestic -trade and
the lower level of prices at which busi
ness must be done to secure foreign
trade. The effect Is looked for In rail
road .earnings also. Gross earnings of
railroads, while holding above those for
corresponding periods . of last year,
show a progressive decline in the ratio
cf increase. For the first six months
of the year Increases in railroad gros3
earnings^were at an average rate of
nearly 14 per cent- For August the rate
of increase fell to 9 per cent, for Sep
tember to 7 per cent and for October to
a little over 5 per cent. The rate of in

EVIDENCE FOB FBEEDOM
FRANKFORT, Mich^ Nov. 2Lâ Judge
Chittenden's charge to the Jury In the
Thomas perjury case in the Circuit
Court has caused a sensation because
of the court's caustic criticism of Gov
ernor A. T. Bliss. The Governor re
cently pardoned Deputy Game Warden
SpaSord of Cadillac, who was convict
ed of manslaughter at Frankfort. The
case arose from the shooting of a fish
erman -who, it was claimed, had resist
ed arrest when Spafford caught him in
an alleged violation of the State fish
and game laws. Spafford's pardon was
practically simultaneous with his con
viction, His friends followed up their
advantage by charging that Thomas
had perjured himself to qualify as a
Juror In the Spafford case, and Gover
nor Bliss, In extending clemency, al
leged that it was a packed jury that
had convicted Spafford! In the Thomas
case Judge Chittenden ordered the jury
to bring in a verdict of not guilty.
"This whole proceeding, so far as the
pardening of Spafford is concerned and
the arrest and detention of this re
spondent, Thomas, is a burlesque upon
decency, justice and fair play." said
Judge Chittenden. "I consider this case
an act of persecution rather than prose
cution, placing the administration of
Justice at a disadvantage in this coun
try and rendering powerless the func
tion of the court by the blind interfer
ence of the State's Chief Executive."
Judge Chittenden has disregarded the
pardon of the Governor on the ground
that the document was not legally
drawn and executed and has ordered
Spafford to appear in his court to-day
for sentence.

which has been taken from London
during the week is not to be supposed
to represent the satisfaction of the

There was a time early in the year

papers. The galleries were crowded to see him meet and or

r A Cuban 'Adventure.
BY HON. WAUHOPE I/TN>*.
<Ex-Juflge of the FirÂ«t District Court of New
York.)
This story does not deal with any ex
perience of mine as Judge or states
man, but of a period of my life when
I was a youngâ a very youngâ and
very inexperienced lawyer.
Had I been less young and less inex
perienced I would not have risked my
newly acquired foothold at the New
York bar by accepting an invitation
from a friend if my father to spend
three months at his Cuban plantation.
But I was a bit run down by overwork,
and I fancied I could wrestle mere
doughtily with the problem of snatch-
Ing fame and fortune from a profession
already overcrowded if I could first
gret a change of air and complete rest.
So, early in November ef a certain
year farther back than I care to re
member, I found myself a welcome and
a decidedly happy guest at one of the
finest plantations on the Cuban coast.
The whole place was like fairyland
to my New York eyesâ a dreamy, lazy,
tropical, multicolored fairyland. For
weeks I amused myself loafing about,
studying native customs, exploring the
hills and sailing on the broad waters of
the bay, that flashed and sparkled at
the very foot of the cliff on which the
plantation house was built.
The one drawback to my perfect en
joyment was the fact that, despite
the nearness and delicious warmth of
the water, I was implored most urgent
ly by my host never to go swimming.
"But why not?" I asked him, when
he first broached the subject. "That
is an ideal sheet of water for bathing,
and Just think what fun it will be to
write to my friends at home, who are
begin to shiver under the advance of
Â¦winter, and tell them I swim in the
ocean every day in November."
"I'm sorry," he replied courteously,
"to deprive you of any pleasure, and
more especially to rob you of the de
light of crowing over your Gotham
friends. But I'm afraid you might not
live to record that swim."
Being, as I have said, very young,
and being, moreover, strongly possessed
of the legal spirit of investigation, I
pressed him to explain.
"We don't like to speak of it around
here," he said at length, "because it is
a tragic subject to more than one of
irs. Have you heard the native negroes
or the Spaniards about here mention el
lobo marino?"
"Yes," I said, after a moment's
thought; "passing by the quarters last
night I heard a negro mother telling
her baby that unless it stopped crying
'el lobo marino' would catch him. My
Spanish is still a bit rusty, but, 'el
lobo marino' should mean the 'sea wolf."
I supposed it was some local bugaboo
when she said it."
"It is not," answered my host grave
ly. "It is a shark."
"I thought tiburon was the Spanish
word for shark." I Bald.
"It is," replied he. "It's the generic
came for shark. But the shark which
has made this bay a terror to swim
mers has the local nickname of el lobo
marino. Sometimes he is spoken of as
el calamldad del mar (the scourge of
the sea). He It is that keeps our beau
tiful bay free of bathers."
"How large Is he?" I asked, curiously.
"All sorts of reports are abroad as to
his size," responded the narrator. "Per
sonally I've seen him but once. From
that one quick glance I should say
he must have been close to twenty feet
long." â¢
"But." I protested. "I've always heard
sharks don't molest men. They say the
theory that sharks are man-eaters Is
Just an old Euperstltutlon invented by
sailors, and that sharks only feed on
dead bodies." w
"They say s o. do they?" retorted my
host; "then 'they* couldn't have been
Â¦with me In my yawl when my best
fisherman, Andrea, fell overboard.
There was a rush through the water
and I caught Just one fleeting glimpse
of the monster as It dragged him under.
He. never came up. There, are a dozen
other men along this bay who can tell
you similar stories of el lobo marino.
That Is why I beg you not to swim in
these waters." Â¦' â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦".
For at least a day I was greatly Im
pressed by what I had heard. Then I
began to experience a longing to get
one glimpse of this dreaded monster.
While I could not doubt my host's
word, yet I felt the stories concerning
the huge Ehark must in some way have
been exaggerated.
I caught myself floating along the
bay's surface by the hour, in my boat,
leaning far over the gunwale to scan
the " perfectly dear depth beneath me
for some trace of "el lobo."
In northern latitudes, no matter how
clear the water may be, the human eye
can seldom penetrate it more than a
few feet. But along Cuba's coast, in
many places where coral formation is
rnost prominent, a man can look down
from his boat through three fathoms
of crystal-dear water and discern every
object lying on the gleaming white
coral sands below.
Yet, though I gazed with straining
eyes, I could never catch even a mo
mentary view of the great shark.
True, I saw several other sharks, rang
ing from four to perhaps eight feet In
length, but nothing larger. Hundreds
of other fish, too, flashed here and
there , through the transparent water

As the shadow of my boat fell on him
THE suits instituted by President Roosevelt against
the meat combine have been won by. the Government
in the lower courts and are pending on appeal. The
revelations of the trial have roused the livestock interests of
the country to take defensive measures that will reinforce
the law and that will protect the producer even if the law in
its present condition fail.
The case of the livestock growers is on all fours with that
of the fruit growers of California that is now under investi
gation by the State Board of Trade. The price of meat to
the consumer is high, while the price paid by the slaughter
and packing houses to the producer is low. The producer
wants both to be governed by the natural law of supply and
demand to the end that the man who sells meat on foot and
the one who buys it on the block may have their natural
rights. At present the combined packers meet every day
and fix the next day's ; price for livestock. This is done
irrespective of supply and demand. This system has been in
operation for nearly eighteen months and the effect is seen
in a comparison of prices. Just before it began No. I beef
on the hoof sold in Chicago for $7 SO to $8 65 per 100. To
day the same quality brings only $3 85 to. $4 50 per 100,
making a difference of about $30 per head on animals of
1000 pounds weight. â¢
In the case of hogs the decline is $4 SO per head and the
decline in mutton sheep is proportional. Applied to the
total of livestock marketed under'these artificial prices the
loss to the livestock growers amounts to $865,000,000, or
equal to one-fourth the value of all the livestock in the
United States. If this enormous" sum had been saved to
the consumers of meat in the form of reduced price on the
block a national economy would have been effected. But
instead of carrying the reduction forward to the consumer
the price of meats, fresh and cured, has remained the same,
and what the producer has lost has been pocketed by the
middlemen
This squeeze has moved the livestock interest to action.
The loss of $30 on every steer represents the loss of the
grower's profits. How to save something for himself is the
problem. Its solution will be found in restoring competi
tion to the market and the renewal of natural relations be
tween the producer and consumer. To this end the livestock
men of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Indian Terri
tory, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico,
Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah
and Wyoming have organized and capitalized an independent
packing company, officered by men experienced in the
slaughtering and packing business. Its operations will reach
from the producer to the consumer and will bring them into
the right relation. This company will buy, cut and dis
tribute meat to the retailers, of the whole country and will
force the existing combine to deal fairly with both ends of
the market. With the interstate commerce law enforced
transportation facilities must be equal, and so there can be
no rebates to shut the new company out of a market.
In this system there seems to be a suggestion to the fruit
growers of this State. No one desires to oppress or to elim
inate the middleman as a distributer of products. . He is a
necessary factor, but when his greed is unrestrained he .be
comes the oppressor, of producer and consumer alike. With
out going to the extent of organizing a distinct distributing
agency a thorough organization of the fruit growers could
demand the presence of its own trusted agents in the dis
tributing centers to oversee the processes of transferring
fruit from the commission firms to the retailer. Honest and
expert men in such a position could easily stop the practices
which now seem to arrest the profits that are in the price
paid by the consumer and prevent them reaching the pro
ducer.
It will certainly pay all the producers of raw .food stuff
and of fibers in this country to watch the effort of the live
stock men to protect themselves and apply its methods to
their own industry. It is. a trite. saying that the prosperity
of the country depends upon the soil and upon those whose
labor brings from it the great staples which constitute the
necessaries of life. The position of such producers is pe
culiar. The manufacturer or the merchant or professional
man can quit. He can readily change his occupation. But
it is not so with the man who is tied to the soil. Production
is with him in a large measure compulsory. He can neither
quit nor change. When production loses profit the loss
goes back to the value of his land and he cannot sell it and
get enough to carry him over into some other bread
winning occupation. So'he has to stay with the soil and part
with his surplus for whatever the middleman chooses to
give him.
The position of the consumer is the same. He must exist,
and while he may limit his consumption of the necessaries
of life he must have them, for it is compulsory. This ena
bles the exploitation of producer and consumer and both
classes are interested in controlling the cupidity of the class
that stands between them.
THE PACKING v COMBINE.
he hid himself behind a mass of inky
fluid, drawing his body and arms up
into a compact ball.
Still no "lobo." arid at last I decided
he was a myth.
One morning I rowed around the
point a half mile beyond the house and
anchored to a tiny coral reef that rose
to about twelve inches below the sur
face a quarter of a mile from shore.
From there I cast my line an>1
watched the baited hook sink slowly
through the clear water. This was
my favorite fishing ground. Yet to
day I cast for a solid hour without
getting a single bite.
The tide meantime was running out.
At last my rock rose above the surface
of the water. I decided to row home.
On pulling up the anchor, however, I
found one of the flukes was entangled
in a. jutting bit of rock a foot or: two
below the surface. I could not reach it,
eo I stepped out of the boat on the
rock, and plunging my hands into the
water, disengaged the anchor and lifted
It back into the boat. A light breeze
was blowing, and as I was wiping the
water from my hands I did not notice
that the boat was slowly drifting away.
By the time I turned to step aboard it
was at least ten feet distant. I watched
it recede with more amusement than
chagrin. I had longed for a chance to
swim; yet I had. not wished to go
counter to my host's request. But
under circumstances like these he sure
ly could not object to my rescuing his
boat before the tide bore it off to sea,
I disrobed quickly and laid my
clothes on the rock, meaning to swim
to the boat, climb aboard and then row
back for my garments.
At last I was ready. ; The boat was
nearly a hundred yards away by this
time. Reveling in the prospect of a
plunge in those cool waters on so warm
a day, I drew in a deep breath and
dived off the reef. Down, down, I went,
far below the surface, until I had al
most descended to the coral sands that
carpeted the bottom of the bay. Then
I struck out, swimming under water
in the direction I knew my boat had
taken. It was a delicious sensation to
feel the cool caress of the crystal clear
water, to have made myself part of
that marvelous submarine world.
On and on I swam. At last I looked
up, for a large oblong shadow lay
athwart the glittering white sands, al
most directly above me.
"I must have swum farther than I
imagined," thought I, "to have reached
my boat by this time."
The next moment I felt as though
the waters about me had turned to ice.
For it was no boat that swung idly
above me, but an enormous fish!
I can shut my eyes and see him now
â the white underside, the tremendous
expanse from the snubbed oval head to
the faintly quivering tail. And it turns
me half sick to recall it.
It was undoubtedly "el lobo." I had
seen enough sharks to know their un
mistakable shape. And this fish was a
shark, but far larger than any other
shark I had ever seen.
I did a lifetime of thinking in the
next ten seconds. He had not yet seen
me, for he was facing in the same di
rection as I, and I was not yet quite
up to him.
I had a general idea where the boat
should be, and I swam for it with all
my strength, still keeping close to the
bottom of the bay, and making a de
tour to avoid the shark's eye.
I swam hard, putting into every
stroke all the power and speed of which
I was the master. My heart throbbed
like a trip hammer and I could feel the
blood banging against my temples.
Moreover, it was growing momentarily
harder to keep from breathing. My
lungs ached and burned and my chest
seemed bursting. Still I swam on, not
daring to rise to the surface, until I
should be far out of the shark's line of
vision. :.*"'
Finally I looked up once more. A
short distance ahead of me I could see
the shadow cast of my boat. But, the
same Instant, my blood turned cold
again. For. still almost directly above
me, hung the shark. .V ;
That he had not seen me I was sure.
At first I fancied I had made no real
progress at all, but was still where I
had first seen the monster. Then the
truth dawned on me. The shark had
seen the boat and was creeping gradu
ally up to it; perhaps in the hope that
some one might fall overboard; perhaps
merely for such food as a fisherman
might toss into the sea from his lunch
basket. He and I had been swimming
at the same rate of speed toward the
same object. T *;-
I was no more secure from him than
I had been before.' And my lungs were
paining me horribly. Perhaps he had
loitered thus about my host's boat the
time the luckless Andrea fell over
board. With a last effort I took a half
dozen v rapid strokes forward that
brought. me under the boat and a yard
or two beyond it. \ Then, driving my
feet into the sand and putting all my
remaining strength into the movement,
I sprang upward toward the surface.
Before I reached the upper air the
shark saw me. The shadow of the
boat, luckily, veiled me until I was
nearly at the top; otherwise I might
not now be writing this.
He rushed forward, displacing the
water and rocking the boat. That was
my last submarine view of him,,. for
the next instant my head was above
water. I drew in a big breath j and
swam, for the boat, which, was .barely
six feet away. I splashed as hard as
I could, churning up the water in hopes
of frightening the monster." He reached
the spot where IV had risen, then
wheeled and, turning on his side, struck
again for me. I was hauling^ myself
over the gunwale of the boat as he
struck.
'. I felt something brush my foot; the
boat whirled sideways from a sudden
Jar, and he had wheeled once more to
the attack. This time, however, I was
already over the gunwale and lying
panting and exhausted in the bottom of
the boat. .
I had missed death in a horrible form
and had missed it by barely an Inch.
I raised myself to my knees and
looked over the side of the boat.
There, not three feet below me, poised
el lobo marino, motionless, alert, wait
ing, patiently for me to fall overboard.
I/was moderately safe, of course,- in
the big, heavy Cuban ': boat.' .; But I con
fess I did not draw a really free breath

THE law has been vindicated by two judicial officers be
fore whom lynchers have been brought for trial. The
cases somewhat offset the travesty on justice that was
displayed in the trials of lynchers in our own State in the
Modoc cases.
Last summer a mob tried to force the jail in Danville, 111.,
to get at an accused negro. The courage of the Sheriff frus
trated the design of the rioters, but they succeeded in killing
a negro who was not at all involved in the matter and was
under no accusation. Those who were identified in the at
tack on the jail were arrested and put on trial. The leader
was tried and convicted of an attempt to murder and is
undergoing a sentence' in the penitentiary. Since then
others who were identified have been convicted, and the
Judge in passing sentence said: "You may thank God that
you are not here on a charge of murder instead of an attempt
to murder, and that I am not sentencing you to be hanged
instead of to the penitentiary. For as sure as you live had
you gained entrance to the jail that night you would have
committed murder, not once, but probably a dozen times."
It may safely be concluded that lynching will not be popu
lar in Danville hereafter and that "leading citizens", will not
be found heading mobs to inflict unlawful punishment upon
men accused of crime. "The satisfaction in the outcome there
is not confined to the Judge, who did his duty, but extends
to the jury, which was willing against all pressure to do its
share in vindicating the majesty and supremacy of the law.
It will not require many such instances of efficient punish
ment to stamp out lynching and convince impulsive and pas
sionate individuals that the chosen executors of the law must
in all cases be trustedto effect its orderly administration.
The other recent instance which admonishes the hot tem
pered occurred in Delaware in the case of the lynchers who
burned to death a negro who had been guilty of an abhor
rent crime. Judge Lore in charging the jury. before which
members of the mob were tried said: "No man has a right
to commit that crime because he believes or fears that some
other person who is entrusted with the execution of the law
will fai] or has failed in the performance of his duty."
It will be remembered that in the Delaware case a minis;
ter of the gospel incited the lynching by casting odium upon
the courts and declaring that it was improbable that they
would do their duty in punishing the guilty wretch. His
sermon was immediately followed by the lynching, partici
pated in by some of the members of his flock, who were di
rectly encouraged by his intemperate harangue. It is to.be
regretted that he was not indicted as an accessory before the
fact and sent to the penitentiary with those whom he advised
to commit crime.
The air has been beneficially cleared by these two Judges,
who conspicuously honor the legal profession and vindicate
the bench. .', Things are rapidly , nearing such a pass in this
country that lynching would soon go beyond substituting
the criminal law, having for its excuse the nature of the
crime or the fear of laxity in enforcing the, law. It threat
ened to pass over and invade the execution of civil justice and
to treat decisions of courts or the delay of them in civil cases
as the excuse for mob outbreaks and the attempt, by un-.
curbed passion and aroused savagery, to undertake enforce
ment oi a mob's idea of civil justice. Such progress in vio
lation of Â«the law is to be expected, and when it occurs it
means the entire subversion of the law and the obsoleting of
its instrumentalities and processes. The result would be
anarchy and the destruction of government by law.
The courts have before them the task of arresting this evil
where it is. They will do it by such prompt administration
of justice as is compatible' with the preservation of human
rights. In this they should be assisted by the bar and by
all good citizens called to' duty as jurymen. If the present
condition of the law permit too great delay, prolonged to the
injury of justice, that is a grievance to be corrected by legis
lators when they make codes and rules of procedure. The
mob can no more substitute the law-making power than they
can take the place of the officers chosen to' execute the law.
When they, plead' obstruction to ; justice in the statutes and
rules established for judicial procedure theyÂ« do assume the
right to' usurp the place and functions of the Legislature.
So it appears that. lynching is set up to displace and replace
two of the coordinate branches of our system of govern
ment and is a far reaching evilthat cannot be too soon nor
too sternly repressed. >â¢.:/.?
The Illinois and Delaware Judges have done their duty
arid the chorus of approbation which has followed their
declarations should give strength to that judicial courage
which is the safeguard of all rights. '
A REMEDY FOR LYNCHING.
Decrepit Spain,
No recent political event in Spain has
created such a stir as the pessimistic
nature of the speech In which Senor
Sllvela announced to the Cortes his re
tirement from public life. He said that
he resigned because he had come to
the melancholy conclusion that at pres
ent Spain does not want a fleet, nor
an army, nor public instruction. It is
Interested only in material reforms, in
agriculture, in Industry, trade and
public works. For his part, if he were
to remain in office, the country must
want an army! a fleet, and such a for
eign policy worthy of it. a foreign
policy frankly accepted without fear of
the risks. To be on equally good terms
with everybody is not a policy. To
combat this state of public opinion he
required the backing of a robust and
stable party. At certain moments he
had fancied that he might obtain It.
When the illusion vanished, with it
went all the courage which enabled him
to hold ofSce. He- was a man who had
lost faith and hope. It was expected
that the Prime Minister, Senor VUla
verde, would vigorously protest against
so fainthearted a conception of Spa'.n's
condition, but he failed to mak* any
reply.
The indictment of United States Senator Dietrich on
charges of the gravest character in connection with alleged
postoftice frauds has led this national scandal to such a crisis
that one of two courses forces itself upon the American pub
lic as an immediate necessity. Either grand jury accusations
should be based on something more substantial than ex
parte statements or the Federal Government should hasten
to clerr its skirts of alarming and, apparently, widespread
frauds.

Since wit and humor were so Ions
associated with the Speaker's office
Speaker-to-be Cannon will be expected
to say many funny things. His humor
is not of the same sort that caused
thousands of stories to be told of
Thomas B. Reed, but Cannon already
has a fine record as the author of "dry"
sayings. The latest is about his house
for Speaker Cannon will occupy a
private residence this winter. Some
body remarked to him the othÂ»r day
that it was a good thing to live in one's
own house.
"Wai, yes, it is," was the reply, in a
} Tw een Wealth and Poverty.
Mr. Cannon's description of the lo
cality was strictly correct. He will live
in a neighborhood that is neither as
plebeian as Northeast Washinarton nor
as ultra-fashionable as Connecticut and
Massachusetts avenues and "Washing
ton Heights.â New York Commercial.
drawl not unlike that of the late SJr.
Reed. "It Isn't such a fine house,
though. It's up here on Vermont ave
nue, half way between wealtn ar.d
poverty."
In the ruins this morning some of
the corpses were close beside the hoop
iron bands of the trunks and melted
gold and silver which had been kept in
these receptacles indicated that the
owners haji fallen and died with their
treasures in their arms. The bodies
were all practically burned to a crisp.
Peter Consavi, the superintendent of
the commissary, said:
"It will be impossible for anybody to
tell for some days the names of all
those who were burned. The bosses
know them only by numbers. I had
their names and numbers in my books
in the commissary, but they were all
destroyed. There is not the least doufet
that several thousand dollars were
burned ud in the trunks of the men.
They kept their savings there and I
would say there was some $4000 or $5000
anyhow. Many of them had enough' to
go back to their homes and families in
Italy, and would soon have sailed."
One of. the water-boys employed on
the work said that he was awakened by
hearing a man cry out, "Fire!" At
this time the fire was In the upper end
of the shanty only, where a struggling
mass of men were fighting to escape
from the building. Awakened suddenly
and confused by the sudden alarm, the
occupants of the shanty were unable to
control themselves. Some of the men
escaped, but a few remained asleep in
the bunks. AH at once the foreigners
on the outside remembered that they
had left their trunks in the blazing
building.
Then followed a rush of men into the
building through the lower door. The
majority of those who entered never
again saw the outside world. Those
who strove for the door were in the
wildest sort of panic. When one man
got ahead of another the other pulled
him back. They fousht, bit and
kicked, and among those who escaped
there are many who bear marks of the
fierce struggle.
One of the witnesses says he did not
believe that a single man of those who
went back for his trunk succeeded in
getting out again.
DIE BY THEIR GOLD.
JOHNSTOWN, Pa., Nov. 21.âTwen
ty-eight bodies, charred and blackened
beyond all possibility of identification,
lie to-night in the ruins of what was
once an Italian lodging shanty, located
on the line of the Pennsylvania Rail
road twenty miles east of this city and
three-fourths of a mile west of Lilly.
In addition to the list of dead there are
thirty-two men who have been re
moved to hospitals and several that
cannot recover.
The fire started early this morning,
while the men were still in bed. The
men who escaped from the shanty alive
are very reticent about the matter, re
fusing to give any notification as to the
origin of the blaze. , According to the
story of one man who escaped, the fire
started from an overheated stove. The
stove became redhot, it is said, and the
interior of the shanty, which was lined
with inflammable tarpaper, caught fire.
The shanty was 93 feet long and about
24 feet wide. It was occupied by sixty
five men, mostly Italians employed on
the Pennsylvania Railroad improve
ments between Lilly and Portage. On
each side of an aisle which ran down the
center of the structure was a row of
bunks three high. In these bunks were
piles of straw.
FIRE STARTLES INMATES.
It is believed that the district about
Manteca (Spanish for butter), with the
advent of a bountiful supply of water
for irrigation purposes, is destined to
be the central milk and butter produc
ing section of California, and already
there is much fine blooded stock raised
there. , .
The construction of the canal was be
gun in 1888 by H. W. Cowell, the first
ditch being constructed by the firm of
Shippee, Morris & Cowell. There were
many setbacks, owing to the lack of
funds, but the projectors never gave
up, and when Mr. Cowell saw the frui
tion of his hopes and witnessed the cel
ebration to-day he cried for very joy.
The celebration marks an era In the
history of Menteca which, not so very
long ago, was but a small settlement in
a barren waste.
NEW ERA FOR MANTECA.
Governor Pardee made a very Inter
esting address and won the regard of
the people by his lively interest in their
great improvement. Among other things
he said:
"Our brethren of the south, forced by
sheer necessity, have taught us lessons
that we would do well to follow. The
lands whereupon stand Pasadena, Red
lai>dF, Los Angeles, Riverside and all
the towns and cities south of Tehacha
pi. were but a few years ago dry and
scarcely able to support the wild ani
mals and .the half-wild cattle that
roamed over them. But her people
wedded the water of the irrigation
ditch to the lands of the hot and sterile
desert, and the result is that hundreds
of thousands of people now live in com
fort and luxury where, easily within
the recollection of him who now stands
before you, only hundreds lived be
fore."
Leroy Anderson of the San Luis Obis
po Polytechnic School made a very en
tertaining talk, as did also Professor
Majors of the dairying department of
the State University. The latter's ad
dress was particularly instructive and
interesting, as the district about Man
teca is especially adapted to the dairy
interests and the raising of blooded
stock.
Professor Fortier of the State Uni
versity made a speech upon irrigation,
and Professor Wickson also made a
very, entertaining address, which was
full of good advice to the farmers.
ADDRESSES TO CITIZENS. .
STOCKTON, Nov. 2LâManteca, a
thriving little town in the southern
part of the county, to-day celebrated
in great style the completion of the big
Irrigation canal which is to insure the
permanent development of the section.
A special train from this city took a
large crowd from here, and there were
fully 1500 people present at the celebra
tion, which included a barbecue and a
bull's head dinner under a huge tent.
In' the town hall several speeches
were made by notable visitors, the first
being by Lieutenant Governor Ander
son. He was followed by President
Benjamin Ide "Wheeler of the State
University. Both spoke regarding the
importance of irrigation in general and
the future in store for the district
about Manteca by reason of the com
pletion of the canal.

The old debate on elevator etiquette
has been revived again. There are
those who insist that every gentleman
should take off his hat in an elevator
if ladies are present, while others say
that rules observed in street cars and
other public conveyances apply. No
question Is involved in more complica
tions. Removing: the hat is, generally
speaking, a sign of respect, but in many
cases custom has made its removal ab-
Burd. In this particular case the ques
tion seems to be almost wholly one of
circumstances. In a hotel, for exam
ple, where a gentleman using corridors

*M A NEW DINING=ROOM SET? 1||
rWe know the completeness of our stock. We want you to know g
it We have forty different patterns of Dining Room Tables, some |
round, some square, some in golden oak, in weathered oak, includ- I
ing the old Mission styles, and also solid Mahogany. I
We have hundreds of different styles of Chairs to match any of J
these Tables. . I
We have put on exhibition in our Show Windows' eight Dining I
I Room Sets selected from this immense stock. The Chairs and Tables I
and Sideboards are selected in such a way as we would choose them for j
our own homes, but of course you may make your own combination 1
â from all of the different styles to suit your own taste. I
I FIRST MISSION STREET WINDOW I
I* Here we show a massive round pedestal table with carved legs. A set of highly polished |
box-seat chairs with leather backs and seats match this table to perfection. In this window 1
we have a leather couch and leather-seated Morris chair, as well as an imposing sideboard and e
china closet. H
p OUR CORNER WINDOW S
I Holds a distinctly different display of dining-room furniture in the old "Mission" style. The |
| heavy, square-legged table with massive dining chairs, upholstered in genuine Spanish leather |
1 of a dark red color creates a decidedly artistic appearance. The loose-cushioned couch with a i
Â¦ Morris chair and novel sideboard add greatly to the simple beauty of this set. I
FIRST 16th STREET WINDOW 8
Contains a neat $30 table of golden oak with a pretty little buffet, worth $33.50. The accom- 1
panying box-seat chairs sell for S3.50 each. This is an attractive set. g
SECOND 16th STREET WINDOW |
Offers a novelty in the way of an octagonal dining table, finished in fumed oak, after the old |
"Mission" style. The leather-seated chairs match the design of the table with a pleasing repe- |
tition. This set is also a product of our own factory. 1
THIRD 16th STREET WINDOW j
Has a dining-room set of a distinctly FRENCH design. The highly polished square table has I
beautifully carved French legs with claw feet, while the chairs are patterned to match this deco- fj
rative beauty. The (dwarf) combination buffet and china closet is likewise well chosen. |
FOURTH 16th STREET WINDOW I
$26.50 will buy the beautiful round pedestal table of weathered oak finish shown in this win- |
dow. The gracefully designed box-seat chairs, with leather coverings, sell for $4.50 each, |
whUe the buffet at $16.50 will strike you as an exceptional bargain. B
FIFTH 16th STREET WINDOW I
Iln this window a round table, though of a little more massive construction, claims attention 1
for its grace. It is of quarter-sawed oak, 48 inches in diameter. The fine box-seat dining I
chairs have closely woven cane seats, while the grain of the backs matches the natural design I
r of the table top. A combination china closet 'and buffet shown in this window is exceptionally |
I attractive. b
I SIXTH 16th STREET WINDOW I
I One of our cheaper dining-room sets is shown in the sixth window. It shows what can be 1
bought for a low priceâ a Pattosien price. The $14.50 table has a highly polished top, heavy 1
legs and claw feet. Six leather-seated chairs for $13.50 and a decidedly pretty sideboard for |
%22 make the entire set $50. Credit may be all right, but cash is better â that is why we al- jB
I ways sell for cash. Â¦ H
Our big corner window alone justifies an evening trip to the Mission. |
There are lots of windows, but every single piece in this window was I
Jmade in our own factory, right here. a
We save you 25c on every dollar you spend here. 1

The new rector Is said to be robust
in health and ln every way qualified for
administering the affairs of this im
portant and influential parish. Young
In years as well as in the service of
the ministry. Rev. Mr. Walkley has
had a successful experience. He is a
graduate of Kenyon College, Ohio,
class of '94, with the degree
of Bachelor of Divinity. He
commenced his theological studies
in 1894 under the direction of
Bishop Vincent of the diocese of South
ern Ohio, by whom he was ordained*
deacon ln 1894 and advanced to the
priesthood in 1S95, ln the meantime hav
ing in charge the parish of Christ
Church. Xenia, Ohio. On becoming
priest Mr. Walkley was called to Zion
Church, Palmyra, N. Y., and remained
as the rector until appointed assistant

and exclusive parish containing Grace

eloquent W. R. Huntington is ln

gaining an exeprience that few men in
the country have the chance to ac
quire. *,
If old St. Paul's needs an awakening
It is confidently believed that the Rev.
Mr. Walkley will succeed in bringing
it about. He is ardent in mislsonary
work and being perfectly equipped in
health and attainments it is likely that
the parish will be asked to do some
thing outside of its own boundaries.
The new rector will be an acquisition
to* the ministerial forces which Bishop
Nichols is attracting' to his side. The

A Belated Inquest.
Mamie Sproat, who is being suÂ«d for
divorce on the ground of desertion by
Edward S. Sproat, In her answer to his
suit, denies that there is any truth In
his charge, and says that though she is
now living at 1737 Logan avenue, Den
ver, Colo., whither she went, she says,
with her husband's consent, she is ever
ready and willing to return to him, and
has frequently volunteered to do so.
Further, she says that Sproat, though
knowing these facts, took advantage of
her absence and commenced the action
for divorce, threatening that if Bhe
dared oppose his suit he would have
her arrested and prosecuted for alleged
offenses. She says that Sproat is worth
$25,000.
The marriage of the Sproats occurred
at Reno, Nev., August 6, 1901. Sproat
alleged In his complaint that his wife
deserted him in August, 1902.
A suit for divorce for neglect was
.filed by Jennie Fischer against Franz
Fischer.
Edith Madden, who is being sued for
divorce on the ground of infidelity by
Captain John F. Madden, has demurred
to his complaint. She objects to the
complaint on the ground that it Is am
biguous in that it does not show when
and where and with whom the alleged
acts of infidelity were committed.
DENIES SPROAT'S CHARGE.
The plaintiff says Yates first forgot
his vows In April of 1902, and that from
that time up to the time of the filing
of the suit for divorce he was in'con
stant attendance upon the Jackson
woman.
The Yateses were married at Punta
Arena, Chile, September 15, 1885. Mrs.
Yates is now staying at the St. Nicho
las Hotel.
Alfonsina Leone denies that. she was
Insane when she married Nicola Leone,
a musician, as he claims in his suit for
an annulment of the marriage filed two
weeks ago: In, her answer to the suit
she admits that the wedding took place
June 18 of this year and says that the
charge that she was mentally weak at
that time and is now is false. By way
of cross-complaint and ln support of
her prayer that Leone's application be
denied and that she be granted a de
cree of divorce, she brings charges of
cruelty. She says that shortly after
the marriage Leone hurt her feelings
and humiliated her by calling her a
"goat" andVorse names; that' August

September 3 he hurt her severely by
striking her with a clothesbrush. She
also complains that he threatened to
kill her and frightened her very much
by flourishing a pistol in her face. She
says that in addition to a divorce she
is entitled to an award of $40 a month
alimony, basing her claim for that, sum
on the fact that her husband is a very
fine musician and the owner of three
violins worth $500 each.

Madame Ellse Yates, teacher of the
science of theosophy and, lecturer un
der the name of Madame Montague on
the teachings of Colonel Olcott and
Madame Tingley, is, with all her knowl
edge of the occult, a firm believer in
the things of the earth earthy. This is
evidenced by the filing by her yester
day of a suit for divorce against Mon
tague Tates. The ground on which the
suit is brought is infidelity. The plain
tiff accuses her spouse of loving others
than herself, one Mary Evelyn Jackson
in particular.
Madame' Yates says in her complaint
that because of her husband's fondness
for the Jackson woman marriage has
been to her but a source of pain and
regret.: She says that she discovered
in Octobar of last year that Yates was
not a rfc*o whose heart pulsed with
hers and whose mind ran in the same
channels as her own. With the discov
ery came a shattering of the ideals
that had made her married life a hap
py one, and she says she promptly left
him. The discovery was made in Lon
don, where she was enlightening the
subjects of King Edward on the bene
fits of the modernized religion of the
Brahmins, and she came to this city,
her legal residence, and instituted the
proceedings to sever the bonds that
have brought her only misery and men
tal torture.

Under Instructions from the Secre
tary of War Colonel Wilhelm, United
Spates inspector of the National Guard
of California, will commence his tour
of Inspection of the different organiza
tions of the State in the first week in
January next. The inspections will be
rigid and close and upon the report
made to the Secretary of War will de
pend the rating of California's citizen
soldiery and the United States allow
ances for the guard will be based upon
such ratings. It has been suggested
that in view of this the commanding
officers during the month of December
maka themselves thoroughly familiar
with the comments that were made by
Colonel Koster as to the shortcomings
of the guard as he found them during
his tour of inspection, and take meas
ures to correct them by the time Col
onel Wilhelm gets around. It has also
been suggested to the commanding of
ficers that they read up the * reports
that were made of the several camps
that were held in this State during the
current year, so they may remedy the
errors that were discovered at that
time. This Is a matter of Importance
to the standing of the State organiza
tion, as the next encampments will be
In conjunction with the regulars, side
by side, so that the guard shall do its
best to the end that it shall not suf
fer too much by comparison. If the
suggestions are carried out and the
commanding officers enter into the
spirit of the desire to have the guard
redeem itself the guardsmen, it is
thought, will make a creditable show
ing.

oughly protected by temporary sheathing.
All the lumber unused had been securely
stored in the old ; sanctuary, until spring,
when the work will be resumed., provided
funds are available by \ that time. . The
sum of $1200 was on' hand when the work
was undertaken by the league, and was
so small ia sum as to bring forth, amused
comment from builders. But what with
strict ' economy, judicious = purchase v of
lumber and , the contribution of much la
bor, i a' gigantic amount of work has been
done within". that sum,; leaving a small
balance on ; the , right side of.. the ledger.
President -Knowland . believes that . $1000
will finish the work on. this, the nnest of
the old. missions in Northern California; '

Over sixty members of the Legisla
ture, a majority of both houses, have
assured Governor Chamberlain that
they will enact none but legislation
which they deemed absolutely neces
sary to the welfare of the State and
adjourn at the earliest possible date.
Had the extra session not been called
the State and all counties, {owns and
school districts would have been thrown
upon their own resources and Interest
upon warrant indebtedness would have
resulted therefrom. The State has thou
sands of dollars In excess of the cost of
the special session.
: SALEM, Or., Xov. 21.â Governor
| Chamberlain to-day issued a call to the
members of the Legislative Assembly
of. Oregon, commanding' them to meet
at the Capitol building in this city on
Monday, December 21, 1903, for tho pur
pose of convening in extraordinary ses-
J Eion to enact laws to provide for levy
I of taxes oa assessment rolls for the
j year 1303. Â£ - ' V. % ''-j.' : ' \ \ ">>
\ This call was made necessary from
I the fact that a defect existed in the
, act passed by the" Legislative Assem
| bly of 1903, providing the manner of
! assessment and the levy and collection
j of taxes, known as the Phelps law.
j The Phelps law repealed the old law,
j but did not provide for a tax -levy of
I 1903, thus leaving the State and coun
! ties without nevenue from taxation for
I an entire^ year.
"Labor and capital are too often at
a^variance, but as fire and water forced
to co-operate produce the all-powerful
agent steam, labor and " capital,
working for each other's interests, pro
duce the wealth of the world."
T. B. Kinne of Portland and W. J.'
Thomas of Sausalito led the discussion.
Howard Stillman, engineer of tests of
the Southern Pacific Company, read a
paper on "Structural Changes In
Wrough Iron." "William A. Doble' of
this city and H. C. Barnes, electro-me
chanical expert of the Southern Pacific
Company at West Oakland, took an
active part in the discussion:
The important question of the even
ing was: "Can the Brown system of
discipline be improved? "TVouId it not
be advisable to de-rate the employe, a
percentage of the marks given In. the
record of suspension against his senior
ity?" W. H. Sheasby.of Fresno, H. L.
Stevenson of West Oakland; T. R.
Jones of Tucson. . Ariz.; , H. H. Hale of
Dunsmuir and J. G. Sloan of Tucson,
Ariz., read papers on the subject. Ow
ing to the unavoidable absence of some
of the speakers. Secretary C. C. Bor
ton read the papers prepared for the
occasion.
"Capital, before investing In any en
terprise, must be protected against loss
and also assured of a reasonable in
come. This protection can be afforded
to a great extent by labor, and the
workman should be early impressed
with this responsibility and brought 'to
realize that in protecting his employer
he" also protects himself from enforced
Idleness and consequent hardship, pri
vation and'want in his family.
Interesting papers were read before
the members of the Pacific Coast Rail
way Club at its meeting in the Palace
Hotel last evening. The papers were
highly technical and the discussion
which followed their reading proved
very beneficial to the railroad men
present B. A. "Worthlngton, assistant
to the general manager of the Southern
Pacific, presided at the meeting.
F. V. Carman's paper on labor and
its application and management, both
In construction and maintenance, was
well received. In part he said:
"The Ideas that I shall advance here
are the result of thirty-two years' ex
perience in handling labor in the vari
ous occupations connected with the
construction and . maintenance of
bridges and buildings and the manu
facture of bridge and building mate
rial. In constructing and maintaining
railways there are three factors to be
considered. The first is capital, the
second material and the third labor.
The last forming, as it does, about the
largest expense item in railway man
agement, should receive careful study
In. order to produce the best "results for
the money expended. Capital is the
controlling power and provides the ma
terial or physical properties, but upon
labor devolves all the building up and
embellishment of these properties, their
care and protection. ; .

tlgatlon the minority stockholders have
been forced to the conclusion that the
majority stockholders in the mine have
a reason for delaying operations at the
property, and they have joined with
the owners of other properties at Tono
pah In the opinion that an effort is be
ing made to depress the value of the
mine with a view of keeping down the
values. of the adjoining ones and event
ually forcing the owners of. the latter
to either enter into a. consolidation
scheme or sell . outright. John Brock
has for several days been conferring
with the representatives of the Mon
tana-Tonopah, the Salt Lake-Tonopah
and the North Star mines, which ad
join the property of the Tonopah Min
ing Company. '"
â¢ WANT TO SEE THE. GOLD.
' For some time it has been contended
by the main stockholders of the Tono
pah Mining Company that the Mon
tana-Tonopah Company's claim apexes
that of the former, and hints of litiga
tion over the, alleged fact have been
made by the Philadelphia people. The
owners of the smaller property, how
ever, denounce these reports as an at
tempt on the part of the big company
to coerce the smaller mine into a sale
or a consolidation, and preparations to
meet a fight in the courts are already
under way.
So far Brock has failed to accom
plish the purpose of his visit, and is
now reported to be confronted with
more trouble at home, where the out
side stockholders, eager to realize
something on their investment, are de
manding that the Tonopah Mining
Company cease dickering for additional
holdings and proceed to get out of its
own property at least a. part of the
vast wealth that a number of experts
claim is blocked out under the ground.
One of the associates of the Brocks,
A. O. Oliver, a heavy owner of stock
in the Tonopah Mining Company, left
here yesterday after a conference with
President Brock.
TOO MANY HIGH RAT.a-rtfr
. To a number of his friends Oliver is
said to have declared that he is very
much disgusted with the management
of the mine and is anxious to dispose
of his holdings. Oliver, it is claimed,
shares with a number of Philadelphia
stockholders the opinion that the Tono
pah Mining Company is burdened with
high-salaried officials and handicapped
by a too, expensive method of mining,
to which' he directly attributes the fail
ure of the company to place the mine
in a condition where it might be im
mediately . converted into a dividend
paying corporation.
The stand taken by the Tonopah
Mining Company has aroused a very
bitter, feeling in the camp against the
managers, . or rather the controllers of
the property, in Philadelphia, and the
fact is plainly evidenced In â¢ the utter
ances of a large number of mining men
from there who are now at the Palace.
Trouble . Is expected, and the smaller
mine owners are arraying, themselves
against the bigger corporation with a
view of thwarting any attempt to de
press values or toward assisting plans
for forcing 'the. mines to' come Into a
combination. ....
John Hays Hammond, who 'is con
sulting engineer of the Tonopah Mining
Company. and receives an annual sal
ary of $25,000, stopped over at Tonopah
on his way to the coast and inspected
the property, but as to the results of
his investigations, which were made in
conjunction with several experts of the
company, he declines to talk.

of. the office is Florentine. There
are.! two .money, order j windows,
for. this sub-station does the largest
money order business of ; any office in
the United StateB outside of the main
office In New York. There Is a wln
dowÂ» for the sale of stamps, one for the
carriers and one for general delivery-
Every effort has been made in the con
struction of this office to . facilitate the
immense business the branch handles.
The . entrance to the building, for
merly the old quarters of the Builders'
Exchange, is protected from the weath
er by a right angle entrance. Behind
the partition the office is equipped" with
everything for the rapid handling of
mails, and special precaution haabeen
taken to protect mail matter from Ios3
in handling. .
Facing on Mission street is a large
door, through which runs a car from
the street, carrying the' malls to and
from the street railway postofflce cars.
Upstairs, owing to the rule which
prohibits any of the maircarirers from,
remaining in the office when not on
duty, a large lounging-rom has been
built for them, with lockers and every
convenience.
Station "K" of the local postofflce
branch service will move* into new
quarters to-morrow or the next day
at 40 New Montgomery street. The of
fice has heretofore been under the Pal
ace Hotel. The new office Is said' to
be one of the best branches in the
United States. There is a seventy-two
foot front in the. place, giving ample
room to the public for the transaction
of its business. '. â , .
BROCK SECUBES CONTROL.
The retirement of Whitney left the
Brocks and their business associates in
control of all but 200,000 shares of the
company's stock, which is owned by
various people in Philadelphia and New
York. For a time -Arthur Brock was
president of the company, but he Is
said to have soon tired of the way mat
ters were going and was succeeded in
the presidency by his brother John.
Since John Brock assumed the direc
tion of the affairs of the Tonopah Min
ing Company there have been frequent
expressions of dissatisfaction among
the minor stockholders, developing
mainly from the fact that it is well
known that the mine is a rich one and
should be paying large dividends, but
for reasons which no one but the
Brocks and their close associates seem
to understand, it has not been yielding
a cent in the way of profits.
Experts twho have examined the mine
have reported that there is already
blocked out ore of a value which is
variously estimated between $2,000,000
and 540,000,000, the ore being of the
same character as that of the Comstock
mines. Engineers who have Jong
worked in those properties and have
handled the. product. of the Tonopah
and the adjacent holdings claim that
the latter can be \yorked at a saving
of 85 per cent.
STOCKHOLDERS ARE ANXIOUS.
These facts have come to the knowl
edge of the minority stockholders in
the East and they have been demand-
Ing to know why the Tonopah mine is
not worked at a profit and, are eagerly
seeking dividends.
Through their own sources of inves-
Mining men, particularly those Inter
ested in the more valuable properties
in the Tonopah district, are quietly
watching the movements of John
Brock, the' Philadelphia capitalist, and
John Hays Hammond, the minjng ex
pert, who have been at the Palace
Hotel for several days. Their coming
to the coast at this particular time of
the year has been attended with much
mystery to the outsiders, ' but to the
mining men of Tonopah their visit, or
at least that of Brock, is known to be
due to the latter's plan to effect a con
solidation of the larger mines of that
district It is a move, however, that is
not likely to be accomplished, for the
feeling in Tonopah is very strongly
opposed to Brock.
John Brock, Arthur Brock and a
number of other moneyed men of Phil
adelphia are the principal owners of
the Tonopah Mining Company, sup
posed to be the richest property in the
district. WilliamjC;. Whitney of New
York was formerly interested in the
mine, but became dissatisfied with its
management and finally made a prop-,
osition to the Brocks that they give or
take, which ended in the latter buying
out the millionaire horseman at an ad
vance on what he paid for his share in
the mine.

THE FEARjOF^HUMBUG
Prevents Many 'People Prom Trying
' a Good 'Medicine.
Stomach troubles an* so common and
In most cases so obstinate to cure that
people, are tpt to look with suspicion
on any remedy claiming to be a radical,
permanent cure for dyspepsia and Indi-
gestion. Many ; such pride themselves
on their acuteness in never being hum-
bugged, especially in medicines.
This fear of being humbugged can be
carried too far, so far, in fact, that
many people suffer for years with weak
digestion rather than risk a little time
and money in faithfully testing, the
claims made of a preparation so relia-
ble and- universally used as' Stuart'*
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Now Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different in one important re-
spect from ordinary proprietary medi-
cines for the reason, that they are not
a secret patent medicine; no secret is
made of, their ingredients, but analysis
sbows th<:m to contain the natural di-
gestive ferments, pure aseptic pepsin,
the digestive acids. Golden Seal, bis-
muth. hycSrastis and nux. | They are not
cathartic, neither do they act power-
fully on any organ, but they cure indl-
gestion''on the common sense plan of
digesting the food eaten thoroughly be-
fore it has time to ferment, sour and
cause the mischief. This is the only
secret of their success.
Cathartic pills never have and never
can cure indigestion and ! stomach
troubles because they act entirely on
the bowels, whereas the whole trouble
Is really in the stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia; Tablets taken
after meals digest the food.; That is .all
theie is to it. Food not digested or half
digested is poison, as it creates gas,
acidity, headaches, palpitation of the
heart, loss -of flesh and appetite and
many oi hÂ«r troubles ."which are often
called by some other name. " \
They are sold by 'druggists every-
where at 50 cents per package. * ,

Commissioner Fllcher was given a
vote of thanks for his information and
the convention then proceeded with its
regular business.
The reports of â¢ the secretary and
treasurer showed that the membership
of the association was increasing and
that many boards of trade and cham
bers of commerce were being formed in
the counties in order, to secure repre
sentation in the association.

came up before the convention was
that of making a big display of the re
sources of the counties represented in
the association at the World's Fair at
St. Louis next year. J. A. Fllcher. Cal
ifornia commissioner to the exposition,
addressed the convention and gave In
formation regarding the space set aside
for California. He informed the con
vention that in addition to the general
State display to be made that the coun
ties of California would have an op
portunity of displaying their resouimss
in separate exhibits. He also suggested
that the six counties combine in mak
ing their display uniform In order to
advertise the central coast section of
California.

A suggestion at the close of the ban
quet that the ladies raise. funds for the
repair of the old mission building was
heartily received, and in a few minutes
the" sum of 550 was contributed by the
delegates. Mrs. S. ' R. Canfleld was ap

the vivid recollections of the generous

The Cliff House will reopen for busi
ness this morning after having been
closed two days. According to B. W.
Rice, vice president and principal
stockholder of the Wilkins corporation,
the trouble between Sroufe and Wilkins
has been temporarily settled and the
business will continue as in the past. Â¦
In an interview last night. Rice safd:
"Attorney Denson, acting for the Wll
klns corporation, and Attorney Shurt
leff for Sroufe, met to-day and effected
an agreement whereby we will be per
mitted to reopen the place this morn
ing- and continue business till the finan
cial trouble is entirely settled. We are
perfectly satisfied with the terms and
the business of the Cliff House will
continue as in the past, with Wilklns
as president and manager."
But Shurtleff had an "entirely differ
ent tale to relate regarding the tempo
rary patching up of the existing finan
cial trouble. He said: "Yes; we had a
sort of an understanding at a meet
ing to-day and we have agreed to al
low Wilkins to open the Cliff House
tljis morning. We have taken the at
tachments : off a quantity of the wine
and provisions, so that the customers
can be served.
* "The keepers will be in charge as
usual and the attachments will remain
on the furniture of the place till the
case is finally settled. Business may
continue for several days, but' I am of
the opinion that it will be but a short
time under the fixed conditions.
"We are Just as anxious, to have the
trouble settled up as is Wilklns; and if
there is any chance of doing so we will
exert out utmost Influence. We realize
Just as much as the other aide does
that the present difficulty Is liable to
injure the business of the Cliff House,
and, of course, neither side wants to
see this occur."

"We intend to make a severe exam
ple of any one found guilty of defacing
public property." said Roncovieri. "It
is possible that the Polytechnic boys
did not paint the signs. If It should be
found that they did they should be
made to understand that they are no
better than anybody else simply be
cause they are attending high school.
It is too bad that some boys do not ap
preciate the fact that they are being
educated by the State at practically
no cost to themselves. They should be
taught to respect school property."
The Board of Education will havs
another position to^fill, owing to Miss
Alice M. "Wolfe, a teacher of the sec
ond grade In the Rlncon Grammar
SchooL having sent In her resignation
to take effect at once. Miss Wolfe s
resignation will be acted upon at next
Wednesday's meeting of the Board of
Education and as usual In such case3
the resignation will be accepted.
The Board of Education decided yes
terday to institute a rigid investiga
tion into the conduct of some vandals
Â¦who painted the legend. "Cold feetâ
23 to 0â Poly." on the Lowell High
School building. The matter has been
placed in the hands of the police and
no stone will be left unturned to bring
the guilty parties to Justice. The build
ing has Just been newly painted and
renovated at great expense.
School Director Roncovieri visited the
school Friday morning and ascertain
ed that the act of vandalism had been
performed some time during Thursday
night. The letters were at Iea3t one
foot high and were done in red paint.
The front of the building was literally
covered with the inscriptions.
Roncovieri says that suspicion at
taches to the boys of the Polytechnic
High SchooL Thl3 conclusion is drawn
from the fact that the Polytechnic
football team beat the Lowell team by
a score of 23 to 0 last year. This year
the Lowell team Returned the compli
ment by defeating the Polytechnic
team by a score of 6 to 0. It Is 1 thought
that the Polytechnic boys took this
method of calling particular attention
to that fact that they had once won
from Lowell.

There was some discussion as to the
manner in which the exhibits of the
six counties were being maintained in
Los Angeles and It was the opinion of
all the delegates that considerable good
would result . from keeping the , exhib
its in place as they, would advertise the
six coast counties among the tourists
who arrive In Southern California's
metropolis. The question of making a
display at the St. Louis Exposition took
up some time of the convention. The
reports of the delegates from each
county showed that every resource and
product of the localities would be dis,
played at the big exposition.'
PRODUCTS tbt.t. OWN STORx*/
The general opinion" of the delegates
was that it was better to spend money
in sending the products of the counties
rather than expending" funds in print-
Ings literature.
"Printing literature." said Delegate
Barnett, "is all very well, but it is not
the best "wayi to get ; people ' out < here.

IMMIGBATION BESTBICTION.
The report from the committee on
immigration presented a resolution re
questing Congress to restrict objec
tionable Immigration into the United
States and calling the attention of the
national lawmakers to the Incoming
of thousands of persons who are a
menace to the welfare of American cit
izens. The resolution asks Congress
to pass stringent laws in order to keep
out of the country undesirable immi
grants. The resolution was adopted
and will be sent to the California Sena
tors and Congressmen. Letters were
read .from Senator George C Perkins,
Congressman V. H. Metcalfe, the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee and the
Los Angeles Chamber - of Commerce,
pledging support to the resolution in
question. Â¦>'â¢
Trade and the California' Promotion
Committee and considerable literature
of the six central coast counties had
been supplied to those two main bodies
for distribution. H. JD. Mathews of
San Jose represents the association on
the State Board of Trade and R. P.
Lathrop of Hollister on the California
Promotion Committee.
L. W. Jefferson reported that Con
gress had been asked to purchase for
national park purposes the great body
of rock formation consisting of twen
ty sections and known as. "The Pinna
cles." These rocks are situated in Mon
terey and San Luis Obispo counties.
Paul Shoup, delegate at large, who
is division, freight and passenger agent
of the coast line of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad, reported that his com
pany intended to secure many photo
graphs of the "Pinnacles" and use the
same in advertising form. He stated
that Congress ' would - .take up next
month the question of setting aside the
land in question for a park.
In expectation of action by Congress
Delegate Shoup stated that some per
sons had filed locations of part of the
land, hoping to make a sum of money
by such transactions. /
The convention decided to adopt- a
uniform sign for display boards to be
erected along the coast line of the rail
road. These signs will inform trav
elers that the towns and cities men
tioned belong to the central coast
counties and will give data as to pop
ulation, climate, resources, etc. The
signs will be ten feet high and thirty
feet long.

Sherman visited; where Helen Hunt
Jackson eought Inspiration for her
famous novel, "Raraona"; where Gen
eral Castro and his relatives lived;
uhere the Dons of Mexico rode for
leagues ever the domains, citizens who
to-day reside in the six counties above
mentioned assembled as delegates in
convention and exchanged ideas as to
placing the resources of this section of
California In such light as will attract
home seekers from the crowded East.
The representatives of the six coun
ties forming the improvement associa

YALE'S OFFENSE IS STBONG.
On . three central plays Harvard
gained ten yards, which gave great en
couragement to the 'crimson side of the
field, but again was penalized ten
yards, which was followed by a poor
pass . by Parkinson and the consequent
loss of the ball to Yale on Harvard's
thirty-seven-yard , line.
On the second play Marshall, by a
quarterback run, covered seventeen
yards, bringing the ball Into the center
of the field. Two runs more carried it
four yards, and then came a penalty,
which set Harvard back to her forty
eight-yard line- Lemoyne's kick was
a poor one,- covering only twenty-two
yards. Again Yale kicked on the sec
ond down, the ball going to Harvard's
twenty-yard line. This time Marshall
covered nineteen yards before he was
thrown.
The kicking was below the average,
especially on Harvard's part and was
a great disappointment to the crimson
supporters. Mitchell, for Yale, covered
338 yards on fourteen kicks, while Le
moyne and Nichols of Harvard covered
220 yards on eight kicks. In rushing
Harvard had slightly the better of it,
gaining 21S yards on sixty-eight rushes.
while Yale made 130 yards on forty
seven rushes. Yale ran back for six
ty-three yards and Harvard for 104
yards. Yale was penalized six times
for sixty- five yards and Harvard three
times for forty yards.
Yale won the toss and chose the west
goal to gain the little benfit " of the
faint west wind. Lemoyne kicked off
to Mitchell on Yale's five-yard line.
Mitchell ran the ball back twenty
yards before he was thrown by Cloth
ier. Yale kicked on the second down
to Harvard's thirty-five yard line, but
the Yale ends came on fast and Mar
shall was thrown before he was well
started. ,
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.. Nov. 2LâHar
vard struggled bravely against Tale to
day In their annual football match,
but was defeated 16 to 0. principally
because her offense weakened and
Yale's .defense grew stronger as the
crimson players were within striking
distance of the Yale goal.
Nearly' 40.000- persons watched the
game. 'While it was not as spectacular
as that between Yale and Princeton, a
week ago, better football was played
and for the first half and for
several . minutes In , the second
half the score was small enough
to make. the result uncertain. In fact.
after Harvard had shown sufficient
speed to get twice inside of Yale's five
yard line in the first half, her support
ers were wellnigh convinced the team
would not only score, but would win the
game. Yale's defense proved too
strong, however, and. backed by 15,000
voices which yelled, "Hold 'em! hold
'em," the blue line stood. firm beneath
its own goal bar, twice capturing the
ball on downs and In the third In
stance taking advantage of a fumble
by a Harvard player. In the second
half Harvard got within six inches of
the Yale goal and yet could not score.
The defeat, therefore, was exceeding
ly bitter for the crimson, as the fast
play of the team beyond the Yale ten
and fifteen yard lines pleased the Har
vard supporters and proved one of the
features of the game.
There was some fumbling and sev
eral blocked kicks, one of ' the Yale
scores being? directly due to the latter.
There were several end runs for fif
teen and twenty-five yards, but as a
rule the play, especially so far as Har
vard was concerned, was a series of
fierce line plunges for short gains of
one. two and three yards.
KICKING IS BELOW AVERAGE.

James S. McCue of Corta Madera
filed a libel yesterday in the United
States District Court against the North
Pacific Coast Railroad Company and
the ferry steamer Sausallto to recover
$Â£00,000 daniages. In pursuance of the
libel United States Marshal John H.
Shine attached the steamer.
McCue was a passenger on the San
Rafael and was Injured In a collision
which took place between* the ferry
steamboats Sausallto and San Rafael
on November 30. 1901, when the San
Rafael sank to theÂ«bottom of the bay.
McCue alleges that when the collision
occurred he was struck In the back and
knocked through a glass door; that
his right arm was half cut off; that
the bones of his right hand and wrist
were broken; that a part of his left
ear was cut off; that his lower Jaw was
fractured; that his body was lacerated
and bruised; that he was thrown into
the water and nearly drowned, and
that he was made a cripple for life..
He alleges further that at the time
of the accident both vessels were run
ning through a dense fog at a high
rate of speed and that the collision was
caused by the. gross negligence of the
officers and crew of both vessels.
Harry V. Storehouse is the attorney
for the complainant.

THE CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
Yell was unanimously elected warden
of the State prison at Folsom to-night.
The board was In executive session
most of the night discussing prison
matters with the new warden.

OVATION FOB BEABCAJTCHEB.
The distance was six furlongs, and
Jack Martin lost no time in sending
Bearcatcher to the front. .
Bearcatcher. the slashing big son of
St George, owned by Garnet Ferguson,
and probably the best two-year-old in
California, delighted the big Saturday
gathering at Oakland track yesterday
by kicking mud all over Don Domo.'
It is not often the gray one has to
stand for this sort of business, 1 but
when the "Texas streak" returned to
the stand yesterday he looked as if he
had been doing cart duty in the char
coal regions of Pennsylvania.
No one seemed to doubt the ability
of Bearcatcher, but It was a question
as to whether or not he was ready, it
being his first public appearance since
last spring. For that reason Don Domo
was installed a 3 to 5 favorite, while
the price about the Ferguson entry
went from 2 to 3.

Britt and Canole spent the day in
the baths working out the soreness in
thdr arms and legs. Britfs face show
ed he had pone through a hard battle.
He had a deep gash over his left eye
and his face was swollen in many
places. Jimmy's right arm was par
ticularly sore. He used it in blocking
c'ir.ole's leads and as a result he was
fcrced to carry it in a sling. Canole's
lips were twice their normal size. His
face was also swollen and his body
ached from the terrific smashes Britt
landed on him.
Britt will take a much needed rest,
but will challenge the winner of the
Corbett-HarJon contest. Canole will
stay out here under' the care of Alec
Greg'Sair.s and will be ready to meet
all comers. He is only 19 years of age
tnd has not grot his strength. In a year
or so he will make a strong bid for
championship honors.
The gate receipts Friday night were
J2S59. Of this sum the fighters received
Jii^S 50. Eritt received 51072 15 as his
share for winning and Canole's share
was J357 38. Britt also had a private
agreement with the Colma Club, which
gave him 13 per cent of the entire gate
receipts, netting him J42S additional.
Canole's bor.us consisted of two rail
road tickets from the East and return.

Harry Corbett took a large party to
the fight in a private car. In the party
were the following well-known sports
men:
Young Corbett, Tim McGrath, Colonel
Martin Brady, George Weeden, Jim

Matt Larkin, Eddie Hanlon, Harry

John Gilmartin. There were several
other private" cars on the road.
The announcement of the receipts of
the fight created surprise, as it was
thought at least 15000 had been taken
at the gate. With this big crowd, the
largest It may ever have. It is esti
mated the club made only 59, which Is
not a good profit, considering that the
Colma building cost $5000. As it is at
present arranged the gallery seats are
at once the best and the cheapest.
MANAGEMENT IS BAD.
In discussing the battle Referee
Welch said:
"It was the cleanest, most scientific
and most gentlemanly battle I ever ref
ereed. In fact, it was the best I have
ever seen. Canole's showing was re
markably good. I believe he will do
better when he gets his strength. I
understand he is only 19 years old. Had
I been called upon last night to give a
decision at the end of the twentieth
round I would have called it a draw.

has no steam behind it."

been large, the indications being that

ties of Fitzslmmons and Gardner in
next Â¦ Wednesday night's contest. The
betting started at 1 to 2. with Fitzslm
mons favorite. John J. Gleason, leader
of the Olympic Club, immediately bet
$250 on Gardner and tried to make it
$300, but the betting switched to 10 to 6.
It is expected the betting will be 10 to 8
before the night of the battle. Gardner
is looked upon as the best short-end
that has appeared in months. He is
out to win. He holds the light heavy
weight championship,- and, If victorious,
is in line for a battle with Jim Corbett
in May. He can also have a battle with
"Sandy" Ferguson or Jack Johnson, in
January, under the auspices of the San
Francisca Athletic Club. Gardner has
everything to gain by beating Fitz. He
has trained harder for this battle than
he has for any previous contest He
has set his heart on beating the Cor
nishman, and if he succumbs to one of
Fitz's heavy punches he will be broken
hearted.
Fitz was born on June 4, 1S62, at EI
ston, Cornwall, England. He has been
at the fighting game since 18S9. He is
41 year of age. During his career he
has been beaten four times, twice by
Jeffries, ence by Jim Hall, whom he af
terward knocked out, and on a foul to
Tom Sharkey.
Gardner was born in County Clare,
Ireland, on March 17, 1S77; he is 5 feet
11% Inches In height, the same as Fitz
simmons. He has youth and vigor In
his favor. He is only 26 years of age
and is the youngest light heavyweight
champion the world has seen. He has
been fighting since 1S98 and has only
lost three fights, one on a foul and two
decisions against him. Walcott secured
one and was afterward defeated by
Gardner. Johnson grained a decision
over Gardner. Gardner comes of a
fighting family. He has two brothers
who are clever ringsters. Ills notable
victories were over "Kid", Carter, Joe
Walcott, Marvin Hart, Jack Root
(twice). Jack Moffatt and Peter Maher.
Gardner Is much heavier and bigger at
present than when he fought Johnson
here in October, 1902, an engagement
which should be thrown out in figuring
form.
Referee Welch Says the Californian Outpointed the Loser in Eleven
Rounds, Was Outpointed in Eight, While Six Were a Tie.
At Twenty Rounds He Would Have Called It a Draw Battle

Yale scored again within five minutes
after the second half began. An ex
change of punts was followed by Yale
blocking a kick on Harvard's nfteen
yard line. The Yale team shoved Ho
gan over for a touchdown. Mitchell
failed to kick a goal.
Harvard by hard work then advanced
the ball to Yale's twelve-yard line. Line
plunges netted nine yards more. Here
Yale braced wonderfully and held Har
vard for downs. The blue rushed the
ball fifteen yards and kicked. Harvard
lost the ball on a blocked kick on her
own thirty-yard line. From here Yale
yard line amid the cheers of the blue's
supporters. It took three rushes to
push Kinney over for the first score of
the game, twenty-one minutes having
elapsed.
As Mitchell failed to kick a goal the
score s^ood: Yale 5, Harvard 0. The
balance of the half proved a series of
bitter disappointments to the crimson.
Three times the team was within
striking distance of the goal, and each
time failed to score a point After the
three failures of Harvard to score kick
ing was resorted to, but the half ended
without further score.

to prevent the marriage of her daugh
ter In the neighboring town of Colfax,
the young woman was taking the wed
ding vows which made her Mrs. Fred
Libby.^ - .
Immediately after the ceremony the
bridegroom called up his â¢.mother-in
law over the long-distance telephone,
told of the wedding and asked forgive
ness. But instead of forgiveness he got
this message: .f
"You lie. You're not married; I'll
never forgive you."
Then Mrs. Valk, mother of the bride,
went to the brother and a sister of her
new son and vented her feelings in
forcible language, but was laughed at.
â¢The wedding followed an elopement
Miss Valk and Fred Libby had been
lovers for some time, but the girl's par

couple . met clandestinely and planned
the elopement which was carriqd out
to-day. The. families of the young peo

fact is said to have accounted for the

I'll Pay $1OOO to Any Weak Man
No matter what else has failed to cure him, if I cannot make him a stronger and better man than he is with my newly improve'd
Electric Belt. This Belt is the marvel of electricians, having power enough to give healthy vigor to any part of the body not totally
paralyzed. . . . .
Every weak man wants to feel young again! To realize the joyous sparkle of nerve life as it infuses the body with its
glowing vitality ; to feel the magnetic enthusiasm of youthful energy; to be happy, light-hearted and full of joyous impulses; to be
free from spell's of despondency, from brain-wandering, from the dull, stupid feeling ; to have confidence, self-esteem and the admira-
tion of men and women I Such is the wish of the broken-down man, and it may be gratified.
Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt
Makes men noble; it causes the nerves to tingle with the joyful exhilaration of youth; it fills'the heart with a feeling of gladness,
makes everything look bright and makes the nerves like bars of steel.
It does this while you sleep, by "pouring electricity, which is nature's energy, into your nerves and blood. Electricity is life
to the vital parts ; when they are weak it will make them strong.
It Is truly the foundation of youth to men who have begun to feel older than they are, and It Is a fine thins for an old man who wants to feel youny. It
Is over two years now since I got a letter from Mr. A. Crawford' of Pokcgama, Oregon. In which he said: "I asked you to send me something to make an old man
young, and you did. I have worn your Belt three months, and am as vigorous as I was when a young man. I am seventy years old and can do as much work as
I could at thirty- five."

A suit for an injunction restraining
the Pacific States Savings, Loan and
Building Company from selling a lot
on Twenty-second street, near Noe, was
filed yesterday by Minnie Wurthman,
owner of the lot. She would prevent
the sale on the ground tha^ the, officers
of the company deceived her.
According to Mrs. Wurthman's com
plaint the property Is worth $5500. She
says that last August she borrowed
$3000 from the company, giving as se
curity a mortgage on the land. She
says at that time the officers , of the
company represented to her that the
document she signed to complete the
transaction was a deed of trust, when
in reality It was an absolute deed. The
first she knew that she had signed
away her rights in the premises, she
declares, was last October, when she
saw her property advertised for sale.
She says further that she was never
notified.
The case will be heard by Judge Sea

STARK HANDS OF CORPSE
HOLD HORSES STEADILY
Shortly after Jones disappeared the
newly appointed executrix of the
Mooney estate. Mrs. Gaylo'r of Phila
delphia, an adopted daughter of Mich
ael Mooney, through her attorney, J. C.
McKinstry. brought suit against the
local banks that had accepted Jones'
order for the money, which they had
held in custody for the Mooney heirs.
The suit was based on the claim that
the order Issued by the court for the
transfer of the money was illegal, in
that the executrix, to whom it was is
pued. had not yet qualified with a bond.
The suit is now pending.
The threatened arrest of Attorney
Jones crows out o*f his theft of the
funds, amounting- to about $14,000, of
the estate of Michael Mooney while he
was acting as attorney for the execu
trix. He secured an order from the
court permitting the executrix to with
draw the money from several banks for
the purpose of depositing- It tog-ether
in another. Instead of carrying out the
order of the court, Jones, with a power
of attorr.ev of the executrix, withdrew
the money and, it is claimed, used it
for his own purpose.
When his misappropriation of the
money was discovered he disappeared
from the city. After an absence of sev
eral months he returned to the city a
few weeks auo and has since been at
tempting- through friends to make some
kind of settlement with the Mooneys.
He made frequent promises to Con
Mooney to straighten out his difficul
ties, but failed to keep them. A few
days ago Mooney endeavored to induce
an attorney who is interested in the
estate of his brother to swear -to a com
plaint against Jones, but the lawyer de
clined. Finally Mooney decided to get
a warrant and . his visit to the Hall
of Justice yesterday was with -that ob
ject In view.
Ha Jone?, the well known attorney,
is to be brought to the bar of Justice
on a charge of embezzling: the funds
of the estate of the late Michael
Mooney. Yesterday Cornelius Mooney,
brother of the deceased, applied for a
warrant for the arrest of Jones, but
the Police Judges declined to issue it
for the reason that they were not cer
tain oa to whether one Is necessary
in a case of the character in which the
attorney Is involved, but the applicant
was given assurance that some step
would be taken on Monday to put
Jones behind the bars.

SAMPLE TRANSACTION'S.
Business In medium and email prop
erties remains brisk. The sales of resi
dence sites continues without any ces
sation or diminution of purchasers. In
this class of property the obstacles to
agreement are less and bargains are
easier made. The sale of lots near the
park is a feature. During the last fort
night, as reported by Lyon & Hoag,
they have sold seventeen lots In the
block bounded by Haipht, Waller and
Ashbury streets and Masonic avenue,
for which $46,575 was paid.
There were no very large sales of
local realty during the week Just closed.
The transactions were undoubtedly in
terfered with by the weather. The rain
will, however, improve the market for
country lands and will make city prices
even stiffer than they are. The
scarcity of choice business properties
in the market is still the prevailing
feature of the local situation* This in
dicates that the 'owners are content to
keep their holdings unless they can
secure the prices they seek. The In
quiry is good. The skill of the brokers
is taxed to bring the owners and pros
pective purchasers to a common basis
of agreement as to the consideration to
be paid.
When the Solace leaves here on or
about December 1 for the next round
trip to the Philippines there will go out
on her as passengers a large number of
men who have been ordered to duty on
the Asiatic station. The number of
these is being constantly increased, the
latest additions to those already on the
Solace * awaiting transportation to
other climes, being a draft of men Just
sent from the Independence.
VALLEJO, Nov. 21.â The U. S. S.
Alert arrived at the navy yard to-day,
and saluted Admiral McCalla with
thirteen guns, she being the first ship
to honor the commandant since he re
ceived his commission as admiral.
Since the Petrel was taken out of the
drydock Thursday barges have been
alongside of her and work of coaling
the ship is in full progress. It is gen
erally understood that when the Petrel
leaves here she will be ordered to the
Asiatic station. A large shipment of
ammunition has been ordered made
from the navy yard to the general
storekeeper at Cavlte for distribu
tion among the various ships on that
station. The Solace, in addition to the
regular cargo will take out as much of
the ammunition as possible.
Upon arrival at Pacific Grove, which
is only 28 miles distant, she received
her basket, but all the fruit waa gone
as were several small articles. The
paper In which, the fruit had been wrap
ped was in the basket. As the. train
stops an hour and a half at Castrovllle
after arrival at 11:40 a. m., before con
nection Is made .with the Grove train,
it is not possible that without the full
est inquiry it can be discovered where
the robbery occurred. Other cases
somewhat similar are reported.
SALINAS, Nov. 21.â From facts
which have Just came to light all of
the car robbers who have been operat
ing for several months past on the
Southern Pacific are not yet captured
in this section.
A few da*ys ago a Salinas woman
went to Pacific Grove. She had a
telescope basket which contained fruit
wrapped singly In pap'ers and other
articles. This was securely faaten
ed by two heavy shawl straps,
and checked to her destination.

Frank Martinez went Into the shoe
store of H. G. Chase, on East street,
Friday and tried on a pair of $3 shoes.
The fit was perfect, and the customer
hypnotized himself in wonderment at
the ingenuity of a far-away shoe fac
tory that could bo perfectly manufac
ture an article that would conform
with his Chlguagua-born feet. Glancing
hastily around as he came out of the
trance he called the proprietor's atten
tion to the fact thaf some unworthy
dog of a miscreant was attempting to
force the back door. While the pro
prietor's attention was attracted he
sprinted away with the new shoes on
his feet. He was overhauled and spent
the night in jail. When lie appeared
before Judge Mogan he said he was an

Joseph and Niocolo Crudo were up
yesterday, before Judge Conlan on
charges of murdering Prospero Migalo
on Green street on November 12. Near
ly every Italian bootblack in the city
was present to listen to the opening
evidence. A somewhat surprising feat
ure waa developed when the prosecu
tion put on a witness who testified that
Niccolo Crudo, who is admittedly the
slayer, attempted to get away from the
dead man several times on the night
of the alleged crime, but that Migalo
persistently followed him." This wit
ness was dismissed as quickly as pos
sible, but the defense took full advan
tage of his testimony in the cross-ex
amination. The main testimony taken
yefeterday was from Policemen Jack
Stelzner and C. W. Matthewson, who
found the body of the dead man. De
tective Harry Reynolds, who made the
arrests gave some evidence concerning
admissions made by the defendants
that practically fixes the slaying, on
Nicolo Crudo.
Joseph Feld, the policeman who shot
and killed his father-in-law, appeared
in- Judge Fritz's court yesterday.- He
Is charged with murder. The arresting
officers showed the defendant the pro
fessional courtesy of allowing him to
sit in a char of the courtroom, but
Judge Fritz promptly vetoed any such
consideration. "The defendant Is
charged with murder," he said, "and
will be locked up in the dock. A po
liceman charged with crime is no bet
ter and no worse than any other per
son." Feld's case was continued until
Monday for preliminary hearing.
' Judge Fritz wrestled with two mur
der cases yesterday. One charge was
against George T. Querbock, who is ac
cused of kicking Annie Wilson to death
at her residence at 5 Capp street. The
autopsy surgeon reported that the
woman died from fatty degeneration of
the heart. The Police Department sur
mised she had been kicked to death.
The Coroner's Jury found an equivocal
verdict that may be offset by the ad
missions of the defendant which he
made to the arresting officers. The case
went over for a week, but as the result
of the original testimony in the case It
is a doubtful question whether or not
the defendant, who has practically ad
mitted his guilt.^will ever have to an
swer for his crime.
.A Turkish rug that looked like an
explosion In a paint shop was an ex
hibit in Judge Cabaniss' court yester
day. It was introduced as evidence to
convict /Thomas Killeagan of the
crime of petty larceny. The hearing
was of sucb importance that W. W ;
Foote appeared as special prosecutor
and R. P. Troy was for the defense.
Among the witnesses was Mrs. Clara
Curtis, portly and impressive In ap
pearance, who testified that as a solic
itor for the Interstate Mercantile Com
pany she had come Into the possession
of the rainbow decoction of carpet
manufacture from the far shores of
Turkey by. the help and aid of Kil
leagan. There Is a civil suit pending
in which the defendant claims he. is
a partner in the concern on Post
street, where Oriental rugs are dis
played In profusion for the benefit of
people â¢vrho like to divorce themselves
from their money to posses mixtures of
that character. The hearing was con
tinued until to-morrow. : ,
Oliver Everett will expend $18,000 to
erect a three-story flat building on the

of which will be $19,500.

Edward Glenn brought his appetite
with him when he invaded the restau
rant of Owens & Starr, at 6 Sixth street,
Friday during the dinner hour. He or
dered turkey, pate de fois gras, canvas
back and a small cold bottle. When he
arose and approached the cashfer's
desk he told him that he was without
money. The cashier figured on secur
ing 'a stomach pump and recovering
some of his waste of material, but at
the suggestion Mr.. Glenn hit him on
the eyejand other parts of his personal
anatomy, so as to confine him In bed
for two weeks. Â¦ Judge Mogan thought
that six months' repression . in the
County Jail would be about right for
Glenn.
Salvator Ornate, who slapped a little
girl's face on Bay street, on November
1 and nearly tricked Judge Conlan Into
letting him go, when a number of wit
nesses testified that on November 17 he
had not touched the child, was sen
tenced to spend 100 days in the County
Jail. The discovery of the trick assist
ed the course of justice materially. Or
nate confessed to his crime yesterday
and was given no leniency.
Mary Anderson, who claims Sacra
mento for her home and birthplace, has
gone astray since she quit the muddy
lowlands of the mountain-gorged river
of her nativity. Whenever she imbibes
too freely she has a weakness to go
6ut into- the highways of the city and
flag street cars with her old plaid
shawl. For months she has been led
tenderly back to the curb by policemen
and admonished. Yesterday she ap
peared ebfore Judge Mogan for about
the steenteenth time and was sentenced
to six months in the County Jail.
Henry Muller, an aged man of re
spectable appearnce, has' discovered a
new graft. â He represents that he is
the father of some prominent man out
side the city who cannot readily be lo
cated, and then borrows $5 or $10. The
arresting officer was Captain of Detec
tives Martin, and. he appeared as tho
complaining witness before Judge Mo
gan yesterday. It was a grave, ques
tion before the court whether or not
the astute captain of detectives had
been a "fall guy" to the blandishments
of the aged â "moocher." : The captain
was not asked directly the question, but
his well-known liberality in money
matters exciting the suspicions of the
Judge and the prosecutor from the Dis
trict Attorney's office. Mr. Muller, de
spite his respectable appearance, will
spend six months under the careful
tutelage of the under sheriffs in charge
of the County Jail.
* â¢ â¢
One of the most despicable thieves
that has ever appeared In the Police
Court came before Judge Fritz yester
day and was given the full limit in the
County Jail. This means six months of
retrospection. He is Frank Hess, who
was employed as a clerk In an employ
ment agency at 630 Commercial street.
Deliberately, according to the testi
monyyhe took $2 each from two work-
Ingmen and instructed them to go .to
Eureka, Humboldt County, to secure
Jobs at $60 a month. Both men sought
merely the opportunity to give their
labor, in return for their living. He
charged them a premium for this, and
when they had ; traveled 300 miles r at
their own expense they found that
there was no job waiting for them.
They worked with a will in the timber
to earn the money to bring them back
and prosecute the thief. On their show
ing Hess was promptly convicted, and
it is a pity that more worklngmen do
not stay, like an Apache on the trail,
to pull down these harpies that make
plunder of .the needs of men out of
jobs.
land/wÂ£o never before had been In
trouble. He didn't look good to the
Judge, so an Investigation of his record
was made. It developed that only three
days before his latest crime he had
been discharged from the County Jail
for petty, larceny after serving six
months. He will spend another six
months at the same institution as a de
terrent to further ingenious efforts at
theft.

In a preliminary report of the com
mittee of fifty scientists formed in 1S35
to study the liquor question, the Influ
ence of alcohol on growth and develop
ment Is considered by D. C. F. Hod^e
of Clark University, and the report Is
based on experiments on the growth of
yeast, the growth of kittens, the
growth of intelligence and activity In
offspring of dogs and upon the activity
of rabbits. It is' interesting to note the
Instinctive aversion of animals to a!-'
cohol. "Kittens refuse to drink milk
with even the odor of alcohol about
it." The dogs, the most intelligent of
the animals experimented upon,
"showed many of the nervous symp
toms In evidence In human beings
when under the long-continued influ
ence of alcohol." Fear is immediately
recognized as a characteristic feature
in alcoholic Insanity, and delirium
tremens is the most terrible fear pay
chosis knows. Under the influence of
alcohol the dogs became timid. "Whis
tles In. the distance threw them into a
panic. In which they howled, while
normal dogs simply barked." In re
spect to vigor of offspring, the sopert
ority of normal to alcoholic pairs is
most striking. These experiments also
prove the general conclusions of hy
gienists, that In feats of strength and
endurance alcohol should be avoided.
The animals also showed a diminished
resistance to certain diseases. â Â£*>

The officers and men of the Fifteenth
Cavalry are still in a quandary as to their
next move. Rumors are afoot that they
will be sent to Panama, while some think
that the regiment will be ordered to Vir
ginia or Vermont.
At all events it is evident that the cav
alrymen are anxious to stay where they
are, as the Presidio is one of the most
desirable posts. The hospitals contain
many soldiers of the Fifteenth, and It is
hinted by some that the men are making
the sick list as long as possible In order
that their regiment will be ordered to re
main here.
The entire regiment was removed yes

which It has occupied for the last ten
days and Is now well sheltered in the

Few engineers who have been found out
of fast runners will make any compari
sons of any kind of their runs with those
of other engineers. There is one thing,
however, about which an engineer of
this class Is "touchy." Suppose he has
made a fast run, but has been laid out or
delayed from one cause or another. He
Invariably wants that delay deducted
from the total time of the run.
Railroad men say that the longer a
man runs on an engine the long-er he
wants to. f He Is in love with his danger
ous calling, and he la a : veritable duck
out of water when once he realizes that
he Is laid off for all time.â Chicago Tri
bune.
"He's a mighty good engineer and can
tell you more of what you want to know
than I can." and then he goes about his
puffins: steed feeling if or hot places and
poking a long-spouted oiler under the ma
chinery. It la 10 to 1 that the other man
will get out of it In the same way.
A fast runner being approached by an
outsider who wants to know something
about the life of an engineer will inva
riably be asked to see so and eo, who
is another engineer on the same run or
<3I\-islon.
"Arriving at our destination," said the
conductor who had charge of the train,
"the engineer found awaiting him a tele
gram from the eeneral superintendent of
the road, who paid him the highest com
pliment that an official could extend to
an employe. The man read the telegram
and shoved It Into the -pocket of his
blouse without a chango of countenance.
No one, from looking under the peak of
his can. could tell what sort of a feeling
had been wakened, even If It affected
him at all." . - Wir- . â¢
Of the men who sit in the cab of a lo
comotive and turn the machine loose In
a race of 100 miles In 100 minutes It Is
said they are the most modest individ
uals of the human family.
ThlÂ« Is a fact said to be clearly shown
by a talk with any of the Chicago en
gineers who have any such record. It
is evidenced not so much from what they
say when questioned as from what they
do not and cannot be induced to say.
For not two men In a dozen of fast
runners are given to talking about what
they have accomplished. Much less are
they Inclined to pass any opinion of the
capabilities of any other engineer.
Take it all In all the men who ride the
Iron horses In races that are appalling
are the oddest characters in the Jumpers
of a mechanic. A short time ago a spe
cial train was chartered to make a fast
run down the country. The engineer In
taking. coal at a station was delayed by
the coal-chute apron becoming unman
ageable. The man who sat in the cab
ahead was as cool as an Iceberg, but no
sooner had the apron been hoisted out of
the way than he opened up the valve
and began a race that for speed and
smoothness was one of a thousand.

With the cost of living advanced al
most half as much again, the natural
tendency should be, in all equity, a
corresponding increase in the earning
powers of the average man and woman.
The claim has been made that the
wages of workingmen have been
raised. This has been done, however,
only in specific cases, and then usually
when threats to strike were made by
the unions. In no Instance has the
raise in wages been in proportion to
the advance in the cost of living. If
we look closely at the labor statistics
for the last two or three years we shall
see that in nearly every case where
there has been a raise of wages among
one class of .workmen there has b"en a
decrease in another. Thus, In thÂ«s re
port of the Labor Bulletin of the Stata
of New York for June, 1903. the aver
age quarterly earnings of certain or
ganized trade unionists show an !n
crease over 1S97, but the true reason for
this, as explained in the report, is that
the principal Increase In the me:Â»'s
earnings Is in the growth of the groups,
that range from $600 to $300 a year, at
the expense of those who earn only $3CJ
to $600 annually. The proportion of men
now earning less than $300 a year is
larger than it In 1902.â Brooklyn

allowance. The aggregate of the
amounts that have come due is only
$80. Of this amount, however, Sperry

of murder in the first degree for shoot

the Jury fixing his punishment at Im

will possibly have something to say on
that particular subject next Friday.
There Is a strong feeling existing in

that the "professional" juror should
be abolished. Two years ago a law
was passed allowing each Juror $2 per
day, and since then, it is claimed, some
Jurors, although bitterly opposed to
capital punishment, will answer in the
Jury box while being examined that
they are not opposed to it for the sake
of the $2 per day. Business men do not
seem to care to act as Jurors on crim

fall back upon the "professionals."

The attorney representing the plaint
iffs states that from what he has
learned from his Investigation of the
case Martha Odell has been engaged
in this business since early in the nine
ties. The work is done through tha
mails and owing to the promises is
more than apt to catch the unwary.
Now that the suits have been brought
and publicity given to the matter It is
believed that numerous other persons
Â¦Will come forward and acknowledge
having taken the same bait.
George H. Horn, a third plaintiff,
comes from Nebraska and asks Judg
ment for $2200.
They all claim In a chorus that they
were induced to sell small pieces of
property at a loss in order to grab at
a golden dream of wealth offered for
sale by Martha Odell and her co-de
fendant, Fremont. The mines of which
they claim the ownership, it is said,
are of no value and the $500 a month
position they say is a myth.
Arthur H. Lee says he comes from
Kansas. He has brought suit for $1100.
a part of which he alleges Â»ie waÂ» in
duced to Invest in some mining stock
with the understanding that he was to
get a position on a salary of $500 a
month. George W. Kent has brought
a similar suit for $1200. He says ha
came from Oregon. :'â¢.Â¦<
The alleged promoters of the fraud
are Martha A. Odell and G. G. Fre
mont. Suits were instituted to-day
against them by Arthur H. Lee. Georga
W. Kent and John H. Horn, who state
that they are victims to the extent of,
several thousands of dollars and that
the number who have been taken In
and lost their money will never be
known. ,
What is said to be one of the most
extensive wildcat mining frauds ex
ploited in recent years has been brought
to light by the filing of three suits this
afternoon by alleged victims, who have
been caught by glittering promises.
The plaintiffs come from three different
States and it is presumed that the op
erations have been carried on through
out the entire West.

* Thomas P. Hogan, a brakeman In
the employ of the Southern Pacific
Company, was fatally injured at Napa
Junction at 6 o'clock last night and died
on the way to the Railroad Hospital in
San Francisco.: Hogan tvac engaged In
switching at the Junction and in cross
ing the tracks his foot caught in a
frog Just as the locomotive started to
back toward him. - Before the .engine
could be brought to a stop it had
passed oy/r Hogan, crushing his left
leg near the thigh.
The injured brakeman was put on a
train to be taken to the Railroad Hos
pital, but he died Just as the train
reached West Berkeley.' Hogan was 30
years old and lived in Oakland.
The engineer said that he did not see
that Hogan was caught until It was
too late.
The Judge has listened to arguments
from these attorneys for 135 days and
from his manner he was Inclined to
grant the fees so far as Davis and
Huxley are concerned. Attorneys for
the Spring Valley, however, made
strenuous objection to the â¢ charges of
512 a day for several years made by
Ford. The matter was not finally set
tled to-day and was continued until
next Monday. The Spring Valley has
been represented by Attorneys M. B.
Kellogg and M. C. Chapman-
The long contested suit of Mrs. Jane
Clough against the Spring Valley
"Water Company' was practically de
cided by Judge Greene this afternoon
in favor of the plaintiff. While final
Judgment has not yet been rendered
the case has been submitted and Judge
Greene stated: "It is my opinion that
Judgment should. go to the plaintiff,
quieting title to the water used by
plaintiff in the amount used before the
alleged diversion by the Spring Valley
Company."
The suit was brought by Mrs. Clough
for the Washington and Murray Town
ship Irrigation Company against the
Spring Valley Water Company to quiet
title to water in Alameda and Cala
veras creeks. By the decision the ir
rigating company is entitled to the
right to use all the -water it -was using
prior to the acquiring of riparian rights
by the Spring Valley Company.
The suit has been in the courts for
the last five years and has consumed
135 days of actual trial, and Is of wide
spread Interest In the district affectedf
According to the complaint of Mrs.
Clough the Irrigating company has
been using water for irrigating pur
poses cut of these creeks since 1874.
In the latter eighties the Spring Val
ley invaded the field and built a dam
above the place where the irrigating
company diverted its water, letting
only a small amount escape.
The suit was brought and. endles3
arguments have been indulged in. Dur
ing the course of the trial the amount
of water in Inches and gallons that ran
through the various ditches of the ir
rigating company have been computed
and this amount in gallons Is in the
neighborhood of 3,000,000 a day. By his
remarks Judge Greene has confirmed
the right of the Irrigating company to
the use of this water as against the
claims of the Spring Valley.
Not the least interesting part of the
victory 1b the judgment of the costs of
the suit which the Spring Valley will
have to pay. Attorneys W. R. Davis
and T. C. Huxley for Mrs. Clough were
put upon the stand to-day and Inter
rogated in regard to their services by
Judge Greene. They ask $2J,000 each. W.
H. Ford, as associate counsel, asks
$cooo.

In Morris C. James, principal of the
Berkeley High School, Berkeley has
found its most public spirited citizen.
Rather than see the streets leading to
his school littered with papers. Princi
pal James has hired a boy to keep it
clean and out of his own pocket pays
the boy's weekly salary.
Mr. James' unusual interest in the
city's looks was suggested by com
plaints the people of Allston way, be
tween Shattuck avenue and Grove
street, made about the' way the stu
dents walking along that thoroughfare
littered it with candy bags and scrap
papers. He told the students in meet-
Ing that it wasn't a very dignified thing
to do and agreed that If they would
stop scattering papers he would hire a
boy to clean up the street. The stu
dents agreed and now a small boy pa
trols the street every day, picking up
the papers of other days.

"When Grantham was brought to the
hospital he was in an unconscious con
dition, and on examining him I found
a fracture of the fifth vertebra and a
partial fracture and dislocation of the
fourth vertebra. When I first exam
ined the man I did not think that he
could possibly live for more than three
or four days, and his condition indi
cated that he would not last more than
fcrty-eigrht hours.
"An immediate operation was neces
sary in order to relieve the pressure on
the urinal cord, which had caused a
complete paralysis of the body from the
neck down. The operation was per
formed and the posterior portion of the
fractured vertebra was removed. The
pressure was removed to such an ex
tent that the patient regained sensa
tion in his body and limbs, but he
never regrained control of any of the
muscles. The anterior portion of the
fractured vertebra, which we were un
able to reach without cutting, the
spinal cord, still exerted a considerable
pressure, and this caused a gradual
disintegration of the cord, finaly result
ing In death.
"Considering the nature of his inju
ries, it v.as astonishing that Grantham
should have lived as long as he did."
Grantham was SO years of age. a na
tive of England. He leaves a wife and
a son. 7 years of age, who reside at S30
Thirtieth street.
With his neck broken and his body
paralyzed from the neck down, Walter
D. Grastham, who was thrown from a
bakery wagon In Alameda, lived for
nearly six weeks after a portion of the
fractured vertebra had been removed.
H!s case was a man-el to the surgeons
â¢who attended him. as they thought
v. hen he was taken to Fablola. Hospital
that he could not live more than forty
eight hours.
Grantham was driving in Alameda
when his team ran away and he was
thrown to- the pavement. He was
ricked up unconscious, and after some
delay was taken to Fabiola Hospital,
where Dr. J. M. Kane found that there
was a complete fracture of the fifth
vertebra and a partial fracture and
dislocation of the fourth vertebra.
Granthem's body was completely para
lyzed below the neck and it was
thought that he would not live through
the next day.
An operation was performed by Dr.
Kane, who removed a portion of the
fractured bone. Shortly after the oper
ation the patient regained sensation in
his body and limbs, but did not regain
any control of the muscles up to the
time of his death. He remained con
pcious until the day before the end
came, and even after lapsing into a
pemi-eonseious condition Grantham at
times recognized his wife, who was
constantly at his bedside.
Dr. Kane was very much astonished
at the young man's vitality and tena
cious hold on life. In discussing the case
the doctor said:

Things Worth. Knowing-.
A pack train cannot be stampeded
Â¦while the bell is tinkling, even under
heavy fire; neither will a charge by
yelling Indians drive away the mules
unless the bell animal can be first run
off. The more commotion there is the
more closely do they huddle about the
bell animal, as though knowing that
there they are safe. Not only do the
mules follow their bell, but they learn
to recojrnize its sound as well. When
two trains meet on the march tho
mules will not intermingle? â each will
follow its own bell. In case the mules
of two trains are turned out to graze
in the same neighborhood, and become
mixed, it i? only necessary to capture
the bell animals, lead them to some
what widely separated positions, rat
tle the bells, and the mules of each
train will at once gather about their
own bell. At nipht, when on the
march, the bell mare Is hobbled and
turned out to graze with the herd.
The packers well know that they will
have no trouble in locating the pack
animals, for they are always to be
found, whenever wanted, within sound
of thÂ© bell.â John Dicks Howe, in
Leslie's V.'eeklv.

electric-distance-printing apparatus as
an adjunct to the telephone. Through
the contract with the Fostofflce De
partment, of which the telegraph and
telephone system is a part, the Fern
druck*r Company is able to establish a
special service for subscribers in Ber
lin and suburbs, who can exchange
communications in printed type by
way of the main telegraph office. The
apparatus is similar to a typewriting
machine. After connection is male,
communication can be had by simply
manipulating the machine like a type
writer; even if the addressee be absent,
the printing goes on automatically on
tape. The text of the message is du
plicated on the machine of uie sender,
so that a correct record Is kept and
mistakes In transmission are avoided.

An Ethical Distinction.
The wire that was responsible for the
electrocution was one that had broken
off where It had been tied to the in
sulator. It was rusty and the high
wind made the strain more than it
could stand and It fell, dropping over
the heavily charged wire beneath. The
police stood guard at the spot until
linemen came and drew the dangling
wire out of reach.
The doctor who was summoned by
Turn Suden said:
"The first Intimation that I had of
the accident was when Mr. Turn Suden
drove up to the house and told me that
two men had been struck by, a live
wire at the corner of Thirty-fifth and
Market streets. I Immediately accom
panied him to the scene, and found that
the officers had already arrived. I ex
amined Mr. Yerrick first and found that
he was past any aid that I could offer.
I think that he must have been in
stantly killed, as he received the full
force of over 2000 volts, which Is enough
to kill any man.
"After examining Mr. Yerrick I turn
ed my attention to Bertz, who was
still breathing, but unconscious. While
I was working over him the patrol
wagon arrived and he was taken to the
Receiving Hospital."
When the call was sent to the police
station for the ambulance Captain of
Police Peterson, who was in charge of
the office, sent two pairs of rubber
gloves out to the officers In order that
they might get the fallen wire clear of
the sidewalk.
J. N". Gallagher, the construction
foreman of the Oakland Gas, Light and
Heat Company, said that one side of
a dead telephone loop had fallen across
one of the light company's leads and
the end of the wire had swung down
within reach of the sidewalk. He said
that the wire had probably broken off
In the tie.
WIND BREAKS WIRE.
George A. turn Suden. driver for his
father, who conducts a grocery, was
driving up Market street and saw the
second man fall, and Immediately went
in quest of a doctor. On tha way he no
tified Policemen Lee Andrew and Fen
ton Thompson, who hurried to the
scene of the accident and carefully
drew the two bodies away from the
vicinity of the dangling, death-dealing
wire.
Turn Suden called Dr. A. F. Higgins,
who made a hasty examination of the
two men. Yerrick he pronounced dead,
but expressed some hope of saving
Bertz, whom he ordered to be removed
to the Receiving Hospital. At every
point of contact with the wire it had
burned and seared the flesh. Bertz's
wrist was burned to the bone and his
face scarred in several places where it
had touched the flesh.
It is hardly believed that Bertz can
survive the terrible voltage that
shocked his system until he was thrown
into one convulsion after another and
it required the combined strength of
five men to place him into tha police
patrol and take him to the hospital.
There his body, still wrenching and
twisting, had to be strapped to the
operating table.
SUMMONS PHYSICIANS.
One man waj killed here to-night and
another lies at the Receiving Hospital
hovering between life and death as the
result of coming into contact with a
deadly electric wire hanging down over
a sidewalk at Market and Thirty-fifth
streets. One man following another a
short distance saw the first fall and
not realizing what was the cause of the
accident, rushed to his assistance, and,
coming Into contact with the same
murderous current, fell prostrate over
the body of the man he went to assist.
The man that was struck first Is dead.
The second lies at the point of death,
having received a shock of 2400 volts.
Clark Yerrick, assistant superintend
ent of the San Francisco, Oakland and
San Jose Railroad, is the man that was
killed. He was walking toward bis
home and had reached the' crossing of
Market and Thirty-fifth streets whÂ«n
he met his death. Behind him was
walking H. Bertz. an lronmolder.
A broken telephone wire hanging over
a heavily charged electric "feeder" was
the cause of the tragedy. The wire did
not touch the ground and was swinging
free when the linemen went out later
to repair the break. But one other per
son saw the accident happen and real
ized the danger of coming Into contact

1118 Broadway, Nov. 21.
VICTORIA, B. C. Nov. 21.â Later re
ports of the Tokai Maru disaster, after
collision with the steamer Progress, re
ceived by the steamer Riojun Maru,
which arrived to-day, reveal distress
ing details.
At the time of the collision the snow
was falling so thickly that nothing was
visible a foot away. A deed of hero
ism is reported on the part of the Jap
anese captain, who tied himself to the
bridge and sank with his vessel, pull
ing the whistle cord as he went down.
Neither the Tokai Maru nor the Pro
gress suspected each other's presence.
The former was sailing northward,
when the latter came up from the east
and drove her bow into the Tokai Maru,
which sank in five minutes.
At the time another N. Y. K. steamer,
the Higo Maru. en route also from
Aomori for Hakodate, was attracted to
the scene by the sound of the ship's
whistles, which were barely audible in
the snowstorm, and on being apprised
of the disaster assisted In the effort to
rescue survivors.
When the accident took place
Captain Hinta did his utmost to save
the lives of others. He sent off boats
with passengers, but only one of them
reached the Russian steamer, which
also dispatched several life boats. One
of them approached tha sinking ship to
save the captain. He had, as stated,
tied himself to the bridge and was
still pulling the string of the whistle.
When Invited to leave his posÂ£ he
sternly refused and calmly sank with
the ship. The Russians shed tears over
this tragic incident. Almost all the
survivors are injured more or less, and
the decks of the Progress were bespat
tered with blood. Sherfwill have to be
docked at Hakodate to repair the
damage to her bow.
A survivor named B. Shablto de
scribes the disaster as follows:
"I was once a seaman, so when the
crash was heard I was able to grasp
the gravity of the situation. I rushed
on deck and observed a man who ap
peared to be the captain urging the
crew to exert themselves. The stern
was already under water, so I hurried
toward the bow. As there was no boat
ready I cut one away from the davits
with a^knlfe and launched It, and in
this I, with five or six others, em
barked. The heavy seas upset the boat
a minute later, and I clung to the bow
of the sinking ship for two hours before
I was saved. During that time I saw
several persons, who were also clinging
to the bow, gradually lose their
strength and sink one by one. The
sight was terrible."
Fpeclal Dispatch to The CalL
DAWSON. Nov. 2Lâ A special tele
gram from Fort Gibbon to the Dawson
News states that fire to-day made a
clean sweep of the military Quarters
there. The loss is not mentioned, but
will probably run to $100,000 or more.
The fire is particularly unfortunate at
this time of the year as the Arctic
winter is now on in full rigor and will
last five months longer.
The flre broke out in an unknown
manner in the smokehouse. Before an
alarm could be given the entire bar
racks were ablaze. The soldiers had
nothing with them to fight the flames
but snow, which proved useless. The
fire made a clean sweep of the bar
racks, warehouses and paint shops.
The warehouses contained the supplies
for the soldiers for the winter and
nothing was eaved. All the soldiers
lost their personal belongings.
The commandant is moving with
great rapidity to again house the men
and send up the Yukon for more sup
plies. Fortunately the stables and
horses were not involved In the fire.
Fcrt Gibbon belongs to the Depart
ment of Columbia, under command of
General Funston.

"This Immense loss cannot well be

Health Officer Smith realized for^the
first time the change In his appearance
made by the new uniform when he
went home to dinner yesterday. He
knew his suit would surprise his wife,
and he" thought he would make the Sur
prise as complete as possible by going
around the house and coming in at the
back door. As he opened the door
quietly and looked. In, he saw his wife
standing in the kitchen with her back
turned toward him. To attract her at
tention he coughed - quite loudly.
Whereupon .she turned, and. as she
caught the 'first glimpse of him she
threw up her arms and gave a scream
and was apparently about to faint
away when the eallant doctor in his
stunning blue regalia," rushed up and
caught her in his arms. "What's the
matter?. Don't be. alarmed. It's I,
your own McKendree." Oh, my Mc-
Kendree, I â I thought it was a â a â po
liceman." Dr. Fraker also appeared the
same day for the first time In his new
uniform, 'and "Lieutenant" Morlarity
and "Sergeant" Evans will soon join
the dazzling health department galaxy.
The uniforms are neat but not gaudy.â

News of the tug Sea Rover and her
big tow, the ship Two Brothers, Is
awaited In marine circles with some
anxiety. The Sea Rover left Astoria
November 16 with the Two Brothers
In tow. Since they left heavy south
easterly gales! have been sweeping up
the coast. The Two Brothers Is towing
down because It was found impossible
to secure a crew for her. The sailors
as a reason for their refusal to go in
her claimed that the vessel was leak
ing and unseaworthy. In the event of
her parting company with the Sea Rov
er she would be in a serious predica
ment, not having on board enough men
to handle her under sail. As the
weather has been unusually bad there
is little doubt that Captain Dan
Thompson has on his hands as big a
contract as he ever tackled and every
body interested will feel easier when
the Rover and her tow pass in through
the Golden Gate, If they do.

By the same act the authority of the
people, as voiced by Parliament, to set
tle disputes as to the succession was af
firmed and recognized. Besides the
Princess of Bavaria, the author places-
Don Carlos of Spain, dozens of conti
nental Princes and nobles, and hun
dreds of commoners ahead of our King,
so far as the quality of their royal blood
Is concerned. All this serves to show
what a lot of humor may be worked
out of a very blue subject. The thought
of a pretender nowadays even making
a pretense is quite droll and amusing.
It must be handy to know exactly
where cne stands in the list of royal
ties, or how far the original azure fluid
In our veins has been diluted by the
common plebeian variety. The Duke of
Devonshire, for instance. Is numbered
3653 from the Princess of Bavaria, and
there are lots of Smiths, Jones' and
Robinsons ahead of him. It Is the cus
tom of^the sovereign to speak of his
subjects as his trusty and well beloved
cousins. If it does us any substantial
good, we may all claim to be at least
the thirty-second ' cousins of royalty,
even without the authority of the Mcr
quis of Ruvlgny.
According to a recent publication,
there is no danger of Great Britain ex
periencing any shortage of blue blood
for many years to come. The industri
ous author of this interesting but un
necessary work Is the Marquis of Ru
vigny. who has devoted his life to the
study of pedigrees. He has discovered
that there are at least 11,723 prsons who
are legitimate descendants of thre
Kingsâ Edward IV and Henry VII of
England and James III of Scotland. It
is' not pretended that the list is com
plete, so that those of us who are omit
ted may attribute it to inadvertency.
Indeed. It Is estimated that the de
scendants of British royalty number
400,000. Thus the Marquis has only
touched the fringe of this extensive
subject. The author has obligingly
numbered each of the persons whose
pedigree he has investigated, so that
they may all see at a glance how near
or how far they are from being at the
head of the dynasty. No. 1 is Princess
Louise of Bavaria, and she Is certified
by the law of primogeniture to be "the
heiress of the Royal House of Stuart,
etc., who but for the act of settlement
would be de Jure hereditario Queen of
England. Scotland, France and Ire
land." By the act of settlement of 1701
the Catholic sons of Elizabeth. Queen
of Bohemia, sister of Charles I. were
excluded from the throne, and the suc
cession was settled on the children of
her Protestant daughter, the Electress
of Hanover. y

BERLIN, Nov. 21. â Future aerial navi
gators desiring to attain great altitudes
will use hermetically sealed double-walled
aluminum and glass cages and before
starting will put on oxygen masks, ac
cording to a prediction of Dr. Hermann
von Schroetler of Vienna in a lecture be
fore the Berlin Society of Aerial Naviga
tion. Dr. von Schroetler maintains that
the physiological disturbances In the up
per atmosphere are due solely to lack of
oxygen and he advised an early recourse
to oxygen inspiration before the bad ef
fects of the poorer atmosphere are per
ceptible, calculating that the lungs re
ceive less oxygen from pure oxygen in an
airship at a height of fourteen kilometers
than from air at the surface owing to the
diminished pressure, and 50 per cent less
at nineteen kilometers, which necessitates
inspiration under pressure. But this
pressure Is available only under certain
restrictions owine to disturbances of the
blood, hence the prediction made by Dr.
von Schroetler. Â¦

useful development of the electrophone
in the future, that Instrument Is not
yet perfected for such a purpose. When
Mr. Chamberlain was speaking straight
before him his words were clearly audi
ble, but when he turned to one side
they became Indistinct, and cheering
and other interruptions from the audi

Mr. Chamberlain spoke eighty
minutes, and his epeech contained
about 10,000 words. Fifteen minutes
after he epoke the last word of the
speech was In type in London.
Mr. Hannsworth has adopted a novel
method of advertising the Dally Mail.
A member of his staff is booked for
lectures throughout the United King

workings of the different departments.
The electrophone is the Invention of
an Englishman. It Is claimed for it that
it marks the beginning of a new era in
certain branches of newspaper work.
By means of the electrophone it was
transmitted to the office of the Daily
Mail, 113 miles distant, where It was re
peated to a staff of reporters, every
word being clearly heard. The speech
was printed verbatim, and the paper
was selling on the streets In three
minutes less than half an hour after.
Mr. Chamberlain had ceased speaking.
Telegraphic reports of the same
speech arrived In London more than an
hour after the Dally Mail was on the
street.

CHERBOURG, Nov. 2Lâ The entry
of the royal yacht bearing King Victor
Emmanuel and Queen Helena and the
escorting squadron into French waters
was greeted with a salute of 101 guns
from the forts. The French squadron
in the roads fired twenty-one guns as
the British vessels picked up their
mooring buoys. The maritime prefect
at once boarded the Victoria and Al
bert to greet the King and Queen. This
evening the French fleet was brilliantly
illuminated. Their Majesties landed at
the arsenal and were received with mil
itary honors. They then boarded the
train.
An incident of the departure of the
Italian sovereigns which occasioned
some excitement was a collision be
tween the torpedo-boat destroyer Vio
let, one of the escorting flotilla, and a
gunboat. The Violet's bows were some
what damaged.

the royal families took place in King
Edward's waiting-room. The two Kings,
arm in arm, then inspected the guard
of honor and the two Queens followed.
Subsequently King Edward and King
Victor Emmanuel escorted Queen Hel
ena and Queen Alexandra respectively
to the saloon train, where the Queens
bid each other an affectionate good-by.
As the train was moving away from
the station King Edward stepped for
ward, stretched out both hands and
clasped the hands of King Victor Em
manuel, who feaned out of the window.
The band then played the Italian na
tional hymn and King Edward stood
at salute until the train was out of
sight.
Royal salutes from the warships,
which were dressed rainbow fashion,
greeted the Italian King and Queen on
their arrival at Portsmouth. They im
mediately embarked on the royal yacht
Victoria and Albert, which shortly af
terward departed for Cherbourg, at
tended by the torpedo-boat destroyer'
flotilla, amid the strains of "Auld Lang
Syne" and a final salute of twenty-one
guns.
LONDON, Nov. 2Lâ Much ceremony
attended the departure from "Windsor
of King Victor Emmanuel and Queen
Helena of Italy. The royal procession
from the castle to the railway station
was similar to the one witnessed on
the occasion of their arrival. The
crowds" gave the visitors a most cor
dial 6endoff.

SUNDAY CALL
WHO FINALLY WINS
PRETTY MADGE STAIRP
-== WAS NEVER MORE IN ' EVIDENCE THAN TO-DAY *^=^
"AT WORK" I
Free Sunday, Nov. 29,1 903
The publisher of The Call, in anticipating the tendency of the times
in giving moTe time to recreation, hunting and fishing/ has acquired for
/" their exclusive use a series of art pictures which will serve as reminders
' during the busy months of those delightful days passed in the field.
"At Work," the title of the next Sunday Call's offering, is a reproduc-
tion from an oil painting by J. M. Tracy, an artist whose paintings of'
dogs have never been surpassed.
Mr. Tracy had for the subject of this study the celebrated Llewellyn
setter, "RODERICK)," who became famous in this country by his clean
sweep of bench and field events.
This picture, while it appeals strongly to those who know every point
in a dog, is perhaps just as interesting to the many who love the faithful A
animal. y
In handling, color and action, "At Work" is a most life-like study; a S
picture that, when framed, could with difficulty be distinguished from S3
the original oil painting. '-? * H
To overlook this is to miss one of the best of the Sportsmen's Series. U

""We get some idea of shape, more
than we do of size. Of color we have
an idea of black and white and of red.
but I think few, if any, of us can com
prehend any other hue. "We picture the
sun as an Immense mass, with red ray3
shooting about It, and daylight as a
million white shafts floating above the
earth. \
"When a blind man .dreams . his
dreams are not like those of other peo
ple, but consist almost entirely of sen
sations of sound. He cannot dream of
scenes and places, for he has never
seen them. For Instance, when -we
dream of hearing of our friends, we
dream of hearing their voices.
"The sensation of sound and motion
take the place In the dreams of thei
blind of the objects which appear in
the visions of the night to those who
can see. I speak of those who have
been blind always, for, of course, with
those who once could see, their dreams
may be filled with visions of people and
places which their waking eyes cannot
now behold, but which may appear viv
idly to them In sleep. But one who has
been blind always cannot dream of see-

There was a good demand for Game, but re
ceipts were too heavy for the regular trade to
absorb. Snipe were quoted lower and there
was a general decline in Ducks. -
Two cars of Western Poultry, one of which
was consigned direct to a retailer, were mar
keted, making a total of three cars for the
week. Both Western and domestic stock met
with a continued steady demand and the mar
ket was practically bare at the close. Dressed
Turkeys were in good request and sold at the
previously quoted rates. Receipts were 14
cases, including 8 from Oregon.

A firm feeling prevailed In the Potato mar
ket with the demand steady and receipts mod
erate. River Burbankg, which constituted ths
bulk "of ths supplies, moved freely, and high
grade offerings were quoted higher. The Ore
gon steamer was due with about 1100 sacks,
but had not arrived up to a late hour, Sweets
were steady and a car of fresh stock cleaned
up quickly at the previously quoted rate.
Trashy stocks of Onions were well cleaned up
and prices of fancy stock had a narrower
range.
< There were moderate receipts of Peas and
Beans from Lcs Angeles and choice lots found
ready sale at good prices. A considerable por
tion of the receipts of Peas came to hand in
poor condition and dragged at the minimum
quotation. Lima Beans were firmer and there
was a scarcity of choice stock. . Tomatoes
continued to sell at a wide range as to quality,
but the market was gradually cleaning up.
The canners were in the market for the first
time in a long while and bought up a large
quantity of poor Â»tock at 20c per box. Fresh
offerings of Green Peppers did better, as poor
and old stock was cleaned up. Dried Okra
was offering at 12^c per lb, but sold slowly.

But there are several hundred thous
and acres of forest land of the greatest
value for protective purposes. Indeed,
so great is the importance of these for
ests that on their preservation depends
the existence of the sugar Industry, and
that is equivalent to saying the con
tinued prosperity of the islands. The
sugar exports of the last fiscal year
amounted to $25,000,000, and sugar is
practically the only export. The rais
ing of sugar requires an enormous
amount of water, nearly all of which
must be supplied by irrigation, the
water being carried in flumes and
ditches from the vret, mountainous
parts of the islands to the dry plains
on which the sugar cane is grown. The
rainfall of the Islands Is nearly all con
fined to the northeast and east moun
tain slopes, where it is tremendously
heavy, some years * more than 200
inches. On the other side of the divide,
and in the plains beyond, where the
sugar cane grows, there may be no
more than 15 inches of rain a year.
The forests are largely confined to
the rainy side of the mountains, and
are necessary as a protective cover, to
keep the ground from washing from
the slopes and the rain from rushing
back too rapidly into the sea. The
presence of the forest cover, since It
makes the stream flow regular, pre
venting both floods and periods of low
stream flj*w, Is indispensable to the
success of Irrigating projects. The
value of this forest, strangely enough,
consists not so much in the trees it
containsâ for they are frequently low.
crooked, and sparsely scatteredâ as In
the Impenetrable mass of undergrowth
beneath them. This undergrowth, com
posed of vines, ferns and mosses, is of
so dense a character that it shades the
ground absolutely and holds water like
a sponge.- It is. however, exceedingly
delicate and easily destroyed. Let cat
tle into such a forest and they will
speedily eat or trample down the un
dergrowth till the bare ground Is ex
posed. | The soil then rapidly dries out
and "becomes hard, and the trees soon
die.- Grasses, insects and wind usually
hasten the destruction. Cattle and
goats have ravaged the Hawaiian for
ests without hindrance for many years
and have worked further each year
into the heart of the dense tropical
growth.
The Hawaiian public lands consist of
1,772,640 acres. AU of these lands,
which are in forest, and many forest
areas privately owned which the Gov
ernment can gain possession of by ex
change*, will be put into forest reserves,
cleared of cattle and goats, fenced, and
preserved. Some' compensation must
also be made for the great areas of for
est already destroyed. It will be part
of the work of the forester to plant to
valuable trees large areas of this de
nuded land upon which forests are of
most vital importance to the agricul
tural Interests. Mr. Hall, who care
fully examined the climatic conditions,
believes that species of the Pacific
Coast, such as redwooi and red fir will
do well In most places at the higher
elevations on the islands. An example
of how a foreign species may succeed
In Hawaii Is furnished by the mesquite
of our own Southwest, which was in
troduced Into the islands some 50 years
ago and now covers about 100,000 acres,
furnishing quantities of valuable fuel.
It is not called mesquite in Hawaii,
however, but goes by the name of
algoba. ' , -Â¦ : '-'-"
The forest conditions of the islands
are unlike any that prevail in this
country. Mr. William I* Hall of the
Bureau of Forestry, who has just re
turned from a two months' examina
tion of the islands, reports peculiar and
interesting problems which forestry
must solve there. Ths islands contain
scarcely any forests capable of yield
ing timber of value for lumber. Nearly
all the lumber used for building pur
poses comes from the Pacific Coast.
The Territorial Government of the
Hawaiian Islands will appoint as su
perintendent of forestry this winter a
man furnished it by the Bureau of
Forestry, who will take charge of Im
portant projects for the betterment cf
the islands' forests. The man appoint
ed will have the responsibilities first of
determining the location and the
boundaries of a system of forest re
serves, and later of superintending a
great deal of forest planting both on
public and private lands.

A world's record for an undertaker
was possibly made this week by B. E.
Mason of Chrome, a small town near
the Mason and Dixon line. He was
called "upon to bury three persons whose
combined ages were 307 years 1 month
and 16 days. They were Miss Lydla
Woodrow, near here, 100 years 6 months
and 4 days old: Mrs. Caleb Bradson.
near .Barnsley, Pa.. 102 years 7 months
and 11 days old. and Mrs. . Ann Kirk,
near Blue Ball. 104 years old. All the
women were Marylanders by birth.â
Philadelphia North American.
Notable Funerals.
The sensation of hunger has not been
easy to explain. 'The new theory of a
German physician is that It is due to
emptiness of the b!oo,d vessels of the
Btomach, and it is pointed out that hun
ger is appeased with the rush of blood
to the stomach following the taking of
food and beginning of digestion. In
many anaemic persons, who have no
appetite wbAn the stomach Is empty,
the blood vessels of the stomach are
really congested Instead of being
empty. " Lack of blood in the stomach
in health acts on a special nerve, which
is a branch of the same nerve trunk as
the nerves of the mouth and tongue. A
stimulus applied to the tongue,' as by
a spice, thus increases appetite, while
disease affecting the nerves of "the
tongue may produce Ios3 of appetite
even when the stomach i3 empty. â New
York Commercial Advertiser.
Feeling Hungry.

The llfework of Mrs. Veatatia J. M.
Gove, .a woman widely known for her
philanthropies, was ended to-day by
death at the home of h<r daughter, Mrs.
J. -H. -Men-all of 1617 Shattuck a venue*
She passed away at the advanced age
of 78 years, death having been due to
the complications j accompanying old
age. - t
Mrs. Gove was known everywhere for
her., charities and philanthropies, par
ticularly In California. She became In
terested in reform work soon after com
ing to California in the early 60's and
was active in securing better conditions
in'puWifr institutions. Fr many years
she was the State Superintendent of
prison work for the Women's Christian
Temperance Union, having been an in
valuable assistant to Chaplain Drahms
at San Quentln prison. She was the
only woman who was allowed the free
dom of San Quentin prison.
Â¦ Mrs. Gove was a native . of Morris
town, N. Y., and the widow of the late
Captain Albion B. Gove. She leaves
two sons and a daughterâ F. A. Hyde
of San Francisco, formerly a member of
the San Francisco Board of Education;
Marcus D. : Hyde, who* is associated
with his brother in the law, and Mrs.
Merrall.
The funeral will be held to-morrow
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock from the First
Congregational Church of Oakland,
with which Mrs. Gove was long, affiliat
ed. The Rev. J. K. McLean, assisted by
Chaplain Drahms, will officiate.

ALAMEDA, Nov. 21.â Manual train
ing, drawing and domestic science as
related to public school education were
the topics of interesting lectures deliv
ered to-day at the convention , of the
Manual Training and Drawing Teach-,
era' Association, held in Assembly Hall
of the Alameda High School. Profes
sor Arthur B. Clark of Stanford Uni
versity, president of the organization,
called the meeting to order at 10:80
o'clock this" morning. Brief welcoming
addresses were delivered by School Su
perintendent . Fred T. Moore, Principal
A. W. Scott, Principal Duncan McKin
non, Principal J. O. Osborne and Prin
cipal Clinton E. Miller of the local de
partment. Professor Myer Jaffa of the
University of California gave his lec
ture on "Tho Place of Nitrogenous
Foods in Diet" at' the' morning session.
Dr. Elmer E., Brown of the University
of California spoke on "Some Relations
of ManualTralning With Other As
pects of Education" at the afternoon
session. He held that there was not
sufficient importance given to manual
training in the colleges. Other papers
read at the afternoon session were:
"Outline, Design and Ornamentation,"
M. J. Doyle: "Hearst Domestic Indus
tries," Miss M. A. Hicks, University of
California; "Sewing,", Miss Mary L.
Crittende'n,' California < School of Me
chanical Arts, San Francisco; "Art in
the Public Schools," Charles P. Neilson,
Alat'me.da.
Mr. Neilson did not believe ' that
enough attention was paid to art in the
public schools. Drawing, he said, was
to art what grammar is to literature.
Great works of art were the labors of
grea.t minds and could only be correctly
appreciated by those educated in art.
FIREMEN FALL

E It was the morning after election and a
stout, thrifty German housefrau was In
a butcher shop making purchases for the
day. The butcher, his clerk and a man
who dropped in to- say good morning were
talking about the results. ! The butcher
was a Tammanyvoter, his clerk Â¦ likewise,
while the visitor had cast his ballot for
the Fusion cause. The. Fuslonlst took the
butcher's chaff good-naturedly, remark
ing that there would be "other elections,"
when the housefrau struck' In with tho
observation:
"Ven I can vote I vlll vote bote tickets.
Then I vlll not be left no matter how the
election goes." . ......
The men looked at each other and
laughed, but no one was rash enough to
enter into argument with the housefrau.
â Brooklyn Kagle. - Â¦
The 'Hausf rau's Politics.
The following table will give an Idea of
fair prices for these beasts and their
average length of life in menageries: -
Years. Value.
Elephant 20 $5,000
Grizzly bear 15 1,500
Black bear 12 200
Lion :...:........... 12 1.000
Tiger (India) 12 2,500
Siberian tigef 12 4.000
White bear 20 1,000
Of course, these prices are only aver
ages and do not apply to trained animals.
A well-trained lion is worth about $5000,
arfd is not on the market at that price.
I have the very best tiger In all the world
â I can sleep with him. and he knows ev
erything. I would not take $10,000 for
him. On the other hand, there are lions
that can be bought for $100. Some tigers,
rIho, are very cheap. Those are the ones
born in captivity. They are not much
good, being degenerates In every respect.
Their bones are soft and their brains are
poor. The great menageries of the world
won't take them at all. - ; > r a;~w" ;v
Some of the white bears are worth a
good deal more than I have stated. Singu
larly . enough, in spite of their , violent
change of climate, they are seldom sick.
A tank of water and plenty of fish Is
about all that the white bear needs to
keep him in good order. The price I name
for the Siberian tiger is also low.; I doubt
that orders for good Siberian tigers could
be filled at that price. They are rare
beasts, tremendous In size and having
coats of hair live or six inches long.

Two volunteer firemen, Charles Gil
martin and Louis j Parquet, came near
finding burial In a bed of "coals at a fire
in "West Berkeley early this" morning.
"While the men were on the roof of the
building trying, to manipulate Â¦ a hose
so that the flames could be reached, the
fire burned the BuppoTtsfrom beneath
them. They were so busy that they did
not notice their danger and had started
to climb to the ridge of the roof when
a warning cry went up to them from
the spectators below. The men felt the
roof sinking under them and retreated
Just as it fell, into the flaming pit be
neath. The flames were temporarily
balked, however, by the crash, which
gave the firemen time to climb to the
edge of the frame still standing and
leap to the ground. They escaped with
slight burns.
The burned building was occupied as
a grocery store and dwelling by Daniel
Duggan. and stood at the corner 1 of
Third and Camella streets. It was in
sured for $2000. Fire Chief Kenny be
lieves that the fire was the work of an
incendiary.
Cost of English Elections.
A general election, such as seems In
evitable -within a very short period, is a
costly business, but not nearly so ex
pensive since .the introduction of the
corrupt practices act. In 1880 Mr. Glad
stone's majority of 211 in Midlothian

OGDEN, Utah, Nov. 21.â Miss Atala
Wagener of Ventura, Cal., came to the
Alumni ball to-night in Ogden with an
equipage valued at no less than $200,000
and was the first passenger over the
Lucln cutoff. The young woman has
been employed in the office of the
superintendent of construction at Og

cutoff work and with headquarters at
the ' new town on the west .side of the

of Navigation Commissioner Chamber
lain on the investigation into the charge
that the Sailors' - Home at San Fran
cisco is a crimping establishment. ~ The
testimony shows that the Sailors' Home
is in the main a well conducted sailors'
boarding house. â¢ Its *. abandonment
would doubtless be detrimental to the
maritime population of that porL : iThe
officers of the charitable society . re
sponsible for its management seem to

WASHINGTON, Nov. 2Lâ The Re
publican and Democratic leaders of the
Senate were in conference much of the
time to-day over the question of fixing
a time for a vote on the Cuban reci
procity bill and so far as they were
empowered to do so entered into an
agreement to take the final vote on De
cember 16, or a little more than a week
after convening the regular session of
Congress. There was no opportunity
to consult some of the 'Democratic Sen

but it is not doubted that they will as

north end of the lake In the usual way,
but advices from the west brought the
unwelcome news that the train was
about six hours late and would arrive
in Ogd#n about the time that the
strains of "Home, Sweet Home," were
being played at the close of the great
society event. The young woman was
in despair and resigned herself to the
prospect of changing her. ball gown
again for workaday clothes and spend
ing the evening disconsolately In the
dreary construction camp. The chiv
alry of the railroad men was at stake.
It 1 was suddenly decided necessary to
send an engine and car over to Ogden
for repairs. Miss Wagener was invited
to occupy the coach ' and she rode
proudly Into Ogden an hour or so later,

Broderick Complied With Lav.
It was ascertained yesterday that
William Broderick, candidate for Aud
itor at the last election, complied with
the purity of election law by filing a
statement- of his campaign expenses
with the County Clerk on November
18 last!, Broderick's name appeared up
on the list of t those who had not filed
such statements with .the Registrar,
but the fact that he swore to his af
fidavit before the County Clerk relieves
him of any responsibility, in the prem
ises.
The Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations to-day had under considera
tion the treaty with Cuba embodying
the Platt resolutions and also the nat
uralization treaty with Haytl, but did
not take action on either of them. A
legal question was raised in connection
with the Cuban treaty and it was re
ferred to Senator Spooner for investi
gation. The Haytian agreement was
referred to Senator Lodge. - '
for a final adjournment - of the called
session before Thanksgiving and there
were no conferences between Senators
and members.
The Senators are quite hopeful that
an understanding to that effect will be
reached, but they say. that if it is not
