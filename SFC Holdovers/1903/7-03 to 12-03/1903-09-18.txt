According to the Daily Telegraph,
which Is supposed to be closely con
nected with Chamberlain, the contents
of his letter to Balfour announcing his
intention to resign were unknown to his
colleagues at Monday's Cabinet council
and much comment is made on the suc
cessful manner in which the secret was
kept. As the Premier has known for so
long that Chamberlain would resign it
is supposed that -all the details of the
reconstruction of the Ministry were prac
tically arranged this week and that he
will be able almost immediately to sub
mit a new Cabinet to the King. Strong
demands are made in the papers for the
elimination of '. Lord' Lansdowne and the
others concerned in the reDort of the
South African war commission.
Rumors are current that' Viscount.Mil
ner,~.'; the High Commissioner . in South
Africa, may be invited to become Minister
for the Colonies, that Brodrick will take
the India Office and that- Arnold Forster
will take. the; War portfolio. Beyond the

reconstructed on .a purely protectionist
Earl Spencer, Liberal leader in the
House of Lords, in an interview last
night, admitted that tne news came as
a complete surprise to him and. though
it was satisfactory from a party point of
view, it would mean a very stiff election
fight with such a powerful opponent as
Chamberlain.
It is this element of N doubt regarding
the wisdom of Chamberrsin's course, in
spite of his tremendous personality, which
loads the Unionists to count more upon
the weakness of the Liberal partv, due
to its internal divisions, than to the
strength of their own party in the com
ing contest. Â¦ The Liberals, on the other
hand, are jubilant. With the discredit
attaching to the Government as the re
sult of the report of the South African
war commission, and the strong free
trade tendency in the country, as revealed
by the recent bye-elections, they look for
ward to an appeal to the country with
the utmost confidence. The Radical Dally
News, In its Joy, declares:
"Mr. Chamberlain has met his "Water
loo, and in, his heart he knows it. His
campaign will be invested with deep.per r
Banal interest, but it will be the cam
paign of a lost cause."
The Standard 'declares that the raising
of the preferential Issue was perfectly
gratuitous. There was never the small
est evidence that either the mother coun
try or the colonies were pressing for it.
To throw this apple of Oiscord into the
arena of party politics, the Standard
thinks, was an Unfortunate error, all the
more regrettable because the statesman
who did so much to create a solid Union
ist column has been the one to shake its
foundation.

BERLIN, Sept. 17.â The military occu
pation of Macedonia by Russia and Aus
tria is believed here to be the only ex
pedient feumdent to prevent war between
Turkey and Bulgaria. This suggestion
does not originate in Berlin. It reached
here some days ago, as an inquiry from
Vienna to the Foreign Offlce as to what
Germany thought of the two powers In
tervening, such Intervention to be barely
long enough to restore order and reor
ganize the Turkish constabulary properly.
The inquiry, it was' assumed, rested upon
a Russo-Austrian agreement. The Iden
tical question probably will be put to all
the signatories of the Berlin treaty.
j; Tho German reply appears to have been
considerably affirmative. Since the terri
tory to be occupied was Turkish, Tur
key's consent ought to be obtained. Ger
many then would have no objection. But
Turkey has not agreed to this, the reason
put forward being that Turkey's prestige
is endangered, the insurrection having
gone too far for Turkey to withdraw. She
had been told she must put down the up
rising promptly and was doing so. It was
now nearly stamped out, and the Porte
felt entirely competent to finish the work
and also to defend itself against Bulga
rian aggression.
With the calling but of the reserves of
the Fourth and Sixth Corps, Turkey Is
now on a war footing, only two Arabian
corps remaining at peace strength. The

European Turkey, it will take consider
ably longer. A month from now, how
ever, Turkey will have all the reserves
available.

however, that he regards retaliation as
a stepping stone to a preferential tariff
and the taxation of food. That the
Unionist party as a whole does not agree
with this view is equally self-evident.
The Conservative papers, while congrat

OOFIA, Bulgaria, Sept. 17.â The Foreign Office here has received reliable information that the Turks have' destroyed the town of Kastoria, thirty-six miles south of iMonastir, and have

cern by the officials here. The population of Kastoria numbers about 10,000, and the massacre of such a number in one place, if the report be true, exceeds anything which has yet
occurred in Macedonia. At the present critical moment, when popular feeling is intense, the effect of the report of such stupendous slaughter may be most serious.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Sept 17.-Another
chapter was added to-day to the serial
story of crime in this county. John C.
Wilson, a well known and respected
farmer, residing about nine miles east of
Santa Margarita, shot and killed his son
in-law, Charles B. Stark. Wilson says
that bad blood had existed between them
for some months, arising from troubles
over land matters, but the immediate
cause of the shooting was a quarrel about
an old saw, which Stark had borrowed
from Wilson some time previous. A
heated argument ensued over the return
of the saw and blows were exchanged.
The trouble took place at Wilson's
house, and after it was over Wilson told
Stark never to step inside of his house
again. Stark Immediately started to re
turn, when Wilson warned him that he
would shoot if he persisted. As Stark
continued toward the house Wilson seized
a Ehotgun standing by the door and fired,
the charge taking effect in Stark's head
and body. Stark lived a few moments
after the shot was fired. There were no
witnesses to the affair.
Wilson, who has always borne an excel
lent reputation, has resided in that neigh
borhood for many years. He is a veteran
of th<? Mexican War and is about 80 years
of age. Stark also was well .thought of
and was a soldier In the Philfjrplnes.'. He
had been In this county about two years.

attitude of the Duke of Devonshire,
whose resignation has been fully expect

would take the present opportunity of
retiring from politics, on the ground of
his advanced years. As to the reconstruc

excited, although the political prophets
are already busy appointing Austen

LONDON, Sept. 17.â The official an
nouncement of the resignations of Cham
berlain and two other/members of the
Cabinet was made to-night at Downing
street In the following communjeation:
The following Ministers have tendered their
resignations, which havejbeen accepted by the
King: Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain. Secre
tary for the Colonies; Right Hon. C. T Ritchie.
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lord George
Hamilton. Secretary for India.
The accompanying correspondence passea t>e
tween the Premier. Right Hon. A. J. Balfour,
and Mr. Chamberlain:
Then follows Chamberlain's letter, dat
ed Birmingham, September 9, commenc
ing "i|y Dear Balfour," in which he
sets forth his reason for resignation. An
extremely interesting feature of the let
ter is the following statement concern
ing a preferential tariff:
For the present, at any rate, a preferential
tariff agreement with our colonies, involving
any new duty, however small, on p.rtlclea of
food hitherto untaxed. even If accompanied .by
a reduction Of taxation on other articles of
food equally universal in their competition,
would not be acceptable to the majority of the
constituencies. However much we may regret
the decision, however mistaken we may think it,
no good government in a democratic country
can ignore it. 1 feel, therefore, that as an Im
mediate practical policy the question Of pref
erence to the colonies cannot be pressed with
any hope of success at the present time, al
though there Is a very strong feeling In favor
of the ether branch of fiscal reform Â¦ which
would give fuller discretion to the Government
In negotiating with foreign countries for a
freer exchange of commodities and which would
enable our remesehtatives to retaliate If no
concession was made to our Just demands.
If as I believe, you share these "views, it
seems to me that you will be absolutely Justi
fied in adopting them as the policy of your
Government, although it will necessarily In
volve some changes in the constitution. Aa
Secretary of the Colonies during the last eight
years I have been Jn a special sense the repre
sentative of the policy of a closer union, which
I firmly believe to be equally necessary in the
interests of the colonies and ourselves.
I believe It 1Â» possible to-day and may be Im
possible to-morrow to make/ arrangements for
such a union. I have had unexampled oppor
tunities of watching events and appreciating
the feelings of- our kinsmen beyond the seas.
I stand, therefore, in a different position to any
'of my colleagues, and I think that I should
Justly be blamed If I remained In office and
thus formally accepted the exclusion from my
political programme of so Important a part
I think that, with absolute loyalty to your
Government and with no fear of embarrassing
It In any way. I can best promote the cause I
have laid aside, and I cannot but hope that in
a perfectly independent position my arguments
may be received with less prejudice than when
they attach to those of a party leader. Ac
cordingly I would suggest that you limit the
present policy of the Government to an asser
tion of our freedom in the case of all commer
cial relations with foreign countries and that
you should agree to my tendering my resigna

Voting myself to the work ot explaining and

which experience has convinced me are essen
tial to our future welfare and prosperity. Yours
very sincerely. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN.
The first portion of this letter refers to
Chamberlain's first speech on the subject
at Birmingham and Balfour*s reply to the
corn deputation. Chamberlain says that
neither of them was intended to provoke
a purely party controversy. He points
out the unyielding opposition of the Lib
eral party, which scouted the idea that a
system generally accepted In 1848 could
possibly require modification in 1903.
Meanwhile the advocates of reconsidera
tion were at a great disadvantage, owing
to the admitted differences of opinion in
side the party. The political organization
of the party waa paralyzed. Chamberlain
declares that unscrupulous use has been
made of the old cry of the "dear loaf
and that serious prejudice has been
created. In the rest of the letter he goes
briefly over the same ground regarding
protection vÂ«s . did Balfour in his recent
statement.!!* " -

vere storm to-day. In New York City
the gale blew at the rate of sixty-seven
miles an hour, which was stronger than
yesterday's gale. The damage was not so
widespread, however, because the storm
did not last so long.
At least half a dozen men were drowned
from fishing schooners that arrived to
day, and it is feared that many more
met a similar fate, as many schooners
are missing, Eeveral of which are known
to have foundered. Among the men who
were drowned were Captain John M. Mor
gan and Fishermin Ned Peterson of the
schoone.r M. A.' Baston and Captain
Latham and Fishermen Peter Barr and
Lewis Wilcox of the schooner Esther and
Anita.

to act not for themselves but for future
generations, and the irrigation expert was
wildly cheered when he concluded.
William E. Smythe of San Diego, Cal.,
originator of the National Irrigation Con
gress from which the present movement
has grown, delivered an address entitled,
"The Influence of Irrigation oh the Amer

Utah pioneers as the fathers of the irri
gation industry among English speaking
men, and then sketcned the influence of
irrigation and the environment of the
arid region on social life and industrial
organization. He predicted a very high*
development of co-operation as the out
come of natural conditions in the West.
This is already seen in the management
of the water supply and will extend in

OFFICERS ARE NOMINATED.
Resolutions of indorsement of Secretary
Wilson's views on irrigation and thanks
for his address were unanimously
adopted.
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson "was
then introduced amid a great outburst of
applause to speak on the work of the
Department of Agriculture regarding ir
rigation. ; / . ; Â¦
When the congress convened at 10
o'clock scarcely half the delegates were
in their seats, the fight for next year's
convention and over the action to be
taken on the land laws proving of more
interest to a majority. Senator Francis
G. Newlands of Nevada was the first
speaker. He spoke on "State Co-opera
tion with National Irrigation."
Mr. Newlands remarked that one of the
difficulties in framing the national irri
gation act was the unwillingness of cer
tain of the arid States/which had already
placed their systems of Irrigation under
the direction of State boards of control
and State engineers, to yield to any legis
lation which gave the Federal sfuthori
ties any right to interfere with State con
trol. He then described the working of the
Nevada laws, which secured the co-op
eration of the irrigation system of the
State and which placed the streams In
entire control of the Government while
the work of construction was going on
The State administration moves along the
same grooves and in harmony with the
nation, and so when the Government
turns control over to the State, as pro
vided in the Irrigation act,' the State Bu
reau will be thoroughly organized, pos
sessed of all the data, Information and
plans necessary to go on with the work
of administration, and even of construc
tion, if any is necessary.
Almost the entire body of delegates
took carriages this afternoon for the
model farm of forty acres conducted by
the State at the Deaf, Dumb and Blind
Institution. The entire tract has been de
voted to experiments In various methods
of irrigation, and the delegates tramped
over the grounds, examining with much
interest the work done by the State.
SENATOR NEWXANDS SPEAKS.
Practical illustrations of what irriga
tion will do for Western land and the best
methods of ' supplying the needed mois
ture to the arid stretches of the "Wes^ as
well as the theoretical science of irriga
tion, were set before the delegates at to
day's session. The morning session was
almost entirely devoted to the reading of
papers by Government exports in irriga
tion and forestry, headed by Secretary of
Agriculture James Wilson.
Late this afternoon, however, a move
ment started by members of the Oregon
delegation to bring the congress to the
Northwest rapidly crystallized.
The fight for the honor of entertaining
the National Irrigation Congress in 1904
has been quite bitter. To-night the situ
ation seems to be El Paso against the
field, with the field of unknown strength.
Friends of the Texas city confidently
claim a victory on the first ballot, assert
ing that more than 200 delegates have
pledged their support to El Paso.

j GDEN, Utah\ Sept, 17.â That there
ft II yiri^ b^ a determined fight in the"
\V JJ National Irrigation Congress fa-
voring the repeal or modification
I of the existing land laws was
made evident to-day. The committee on
resolutions after practically an all-day
session found itself hopelessly divided on
two of three great questions before itâ
the desert land act and the commutation
clause of the homestead act â and to-mor
row majority and minority reports will
be presented on the action recommended
by the committee. The vote on these two
questions was 12 for and 9 against. The
sentiment in favor of the repeal of the
timber and stone act, under which, the
opinion was expressed, great frauds were
being perpetrated against the Govern
ment, was almost unanimous. Nevertheless
on this, as well as on other recommenda
tions, a sharp fight will be waged, with
the outcome in doubt. The Idaho delega
tion held a caucus this afternoon and in
structed Congressman French to lead the
light against action in favor of the re
peal of the existing laws, ajnd' members
of other Northwestern delegations are
also preparing to oppose to the last any
such action. An attempt it is stated will
be made to bring the subject before the
congress the moment next year's meeting
place, the vote on which will be taken
immediately on reconvening to-morrow
morning 1 , has been decided upon, and pro
tracted debate is looked for before the
National Irrigation CongresB takes its
stand as a body on the existing national
land laws. ,

CHICAGO, Sept. 17.â The physicians at
tending E!r Thomas Lipton, who is ill of
eatarrhal appendicitis in his apartments
in the Auditorium Annex, reported late
to-night that the patient's condition was
t/r.tirely satisfactory. The crisis is ex
pected within the next twenty-four hours.
If no unforeseen Fymploms develop within
that time his speedy recovery is said to
be certain.
A number of messages of sympathy
from New York friends were received last
night and read with pleasure by Sir
Thomas when he awoke this morning.
There will be no further formal consulta
tions of the physicians unless the unex
pected in the form of a charge for tha
TvorsÂ«* occurs. It is still believed that an
operation will be unnecessary, as no pus

i According to the beat Information from
those who were in the conferences to-day
Jett offered through his mother to make
a confession implicating others in the
feud murders In Breathitt County, but he
Insists on saving his uncles, and for this
reason the commonwealth would not ac
cept his overtures. It is said that the
commonwealth's attorneys would not ac
cept anything except a -clean breast of
the whole anair, and they seem to be can
fldent that such a confession will be
forthcoming before the trial is concluded,
as the prisoner believes he has been de
serted by those who were expected to
stand by him.
The feature of the afternoon waa the
testimony of John Patrick, who waa com
pelled to leave Breathltt County because
from his law office, across the street from
the courthouse in Jaclcson. he had wit
nessed the shooting of Cockrill and saw
what occurred after the shooting of Mar
cum.
But the most sensational developments
to-day were outside of the courtroom.
Mrs. Hagins, the mother, of Curtis Jett,
made overtures not only to the attorneys
for the commonwealth, but also to Thom
as Cockrill, a brother of the victim. After
her conference with these persons during
the noon recess she continued them dur
ing the afternoon and evening with Dan
iel Hurst, the father of Mrs. Marcum,
Judge John Patrick and Attorney W. W.
Vaughan, asking them' to intercede for
her son. Another conference is to be held
to-morrow morning, and It is currently
reported that Curtis Jett may then make
a confession.
CTNTHIANA, Ky., Sept. 17.â Taking of

both on personal and pÂ«bllc grounds. I learn
that Austen Chamberlain Is ready to remain
a member of the Government? There could be
no more conclusive- evidence that in your judg.
ment.-as in mine, the exclusion of the taxation
of food from the party programme is. in the
existing circumstances, a course best fitted
practically to further the cause of fiscal re
form.
"Therefore this reply." he saye, "rather
embodies the results cf our conversations
than adds anything new to them." Bal
four continues:
Agreeing as I <Jo with you that the time,
has come when n change should be made In thÂ«
fiscal canons by which we bound ourselves
in our commercial dealings with other Gov
ernment* it seems paradoxical. Indeed, that
you should leave the Cabinet at the same time
that others of my colleagues are leaving It
who disagree on the very point with us both.
Tet I cannot but adroit that there is some.
forcÂ« In your arguments in support of that
course based as they are upon your special
and personal relation with that portion of tha
controversy which deals with colonial prefer
ence. You have done more than any man,
living or dead, to bring home to tha citizen*
of the empire the consciousness of Imperial
obligation and Interdependence between the
various fragments into which the empire la
geographically divided.
I believe you to be right in holding that thla
interdependence should find expression in our
commercial as well as our political and mil
itary relations. I believe with you that a
closer fiscal union between the mother coun
try and the colonies would benefit the trade,
of both. and. If such closer unton could bo
established on fitting terms, advantages to
both parties would increase with years and as
the colonies grew in wealth and population.
If there has ever been any difference be
tween us in connection with this matter it ha*
only been with regard to the practicability
of the proposal which would seem to require.
on the part of the colonies, a limitation In the
all-around development fft a protective policy
and, ton the part of this country, the estab
lishment of a preference in favor of important
colonial products. On the first of these re
quirements I uy nothing, but if the second
Involves, as it rdoet certainly does, a taxa
tion, however light, upon foodstuffs. I am
convinced, with you. that public . opinion !Â«
not yet ripe for such an arrangement. The
reasons may easily be found in past political
battles and present political miÂ»repreaÂ«nta
tlons.
If then this branch of fiscal reform Is not
at present within the limits of practical poli
tics, you are surely right in your advice not
to treat it as lndlssolubly connected with that
other branch of fiscal reform to which we both
attach importance, and which, we believe, the
country U prepared to consider without pre
judice. I feel, however, deeply concerned that
you should regard this conclusion, however
well founded, as one making It difficult In your
Very special circumstances for you to remain
a member of the Government. Yet I do nut
venture in a matter so strictly personal to raise
any objection If you think you can bÂ«-st servo
the interests of Imperial unity, for which you
have done so much, by pressing your views
on colonial preference with the freedom which
is possible in an Independent position, but
hardly compatible with office.
How can I criticize your determination? The
loss to the Government Is great Indeed, but
the gain to the cause you have at heart may
be greater still. If so. what can I do but
acquiesce? Yours very sincerely.

NEW YORK, Sept. 17.â One of the big
gest coups in Wall street during the re
cent bear raid. It was learned today,
was made by younir Cornelius Vanderbilt.

Most of his Wall, street profits were
made in Brooklyn Rapid Transit and
Southern Pacific. He did not touch United

a possibility of a twenty-two point turn
might have civen him. Nor did he sell

ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. -17.â Fierce
fights between Jews and Christians, in
which four Christians and two Jews were
killed and many persons were seriously
Injured, are reported from Gomela, in the
government of MogbilefT. The disturb
ances occurred on September U and start
ed from a dispute between a peasant and
a Jewish dealer. The police intervened,
and according to the version published
here the Jews, threw stones and fired on
the police, several oC whom were Injured.
The disturbances were renewed three
days later, some Jewish booths being de
molished. The Jews attempted to prevent
the destruction of the booths, and twen
ty persons were Injured on both sides.
Troops then arrived on the scene and
were received with shots from tha Jaw3.
The military returned the fire and Ulti

VIENNA, Sept. 17.â Emperor Francis
Joseph, who to-day -Sreturned from the
army maneuvers, has Issued an Important
army order, emphatically declaring he
will never consent to the demands of the
Hungarian party, which insists ( on the
use of its own language by officers In giv
ing commands to the Hungarian section
of the forces. The Emperor's army order
caused an Immense sensation in Austria
and In Hungary.
The pathetic assurance that he will
never give up his rights and prerogatives
as chief commander sounds like a war
proclamation against the known Hunga
rian national army demands. The impres

most indescribable. Hitherto the Em

Wiley thought this declaration too
sweeping. He believes that there are
some genuine chateau and vineyard wines
imported into the United States, > but he
believes that they usually are special im
portations, often made for Individuals,
and that the general buyer seldom gets
good wines. The label looks all right and
the retailer mayjnake customers believe
thatâ the wine is genuine, but in. most
cases It Is not.
Under the new food exclusion law the
Secretary, of the Treasury is authorized,
on certification from the Secretary of Ag
riculture, to exclude from the United
States food products or beverages that
are adulterated so as to be injurious to
health; that are falsely labeled, or the
sale of which Is prohibited or restricted
In the countries of their origin. The
greatest difficulty in the enforcement of
this law lies in its application to falsely
labeled Â¦ wines and liquors. -Chem'cal
analysis is utterly powerless to detect the
difference that exists between high-grade
claret 'of the most celebrated vintage and
the common vintage, yet a difference ex
ists and is what makes bne wine many
times more valuable in the market than
others.' It is equally impossible to detect
blended whisky by ordinary chemical
analysis.
Wiley. is of the opinion that most of the
Scotch whiskies Imported Into the United
States are blended.
Wiley says that one of the leading wine
experts of Europe, whom he consulted
while in London, remarked that "there
are no chateau or vineyard wines shtpped
to the United States. The American peo
ple drink nothing but 'labels.' "
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17.-ProfÂ«ssor
Wiley, chief of the Bureau of^phemistry
of the Department of Agriculture, who

"preserved" foods. It is the intention of
Wiley to ascertain accurately the effect
on men of good health using food treated
with chemicals.

There are many qualities which we need
alike In orivate citizen and In public man,
but three above all â three for. the lack of
which no brilliancy and no'genias can atoneâ
We new! the same type of character now
that was needed by the men who with Wash
ington first inaugurated the system of frte
popular government, the system of combined
liberty and order here on this continent: that
was needed by the men > who under Lincoln
perpetuated Â».he government which had thus
been Inaugurated in the days of Washington.
The qualities essential to good citizenship and
to good public service now are in all their
essentials exactly the name as In the days
when the first Congresses met to provide for
the establishment of the Union; as in the
days, reventy years later, when the Con
gresses met which had to provide for its sal
vation. -. Â«L?>
There was no patent device for securing vic
tory by force ot arms forty years ago; and
there Is no patent device for securing victory
for the forces of righteousness in civil life
bow. In each case the all-Important factor
was and is the character of the individual
man. Good laws in the state, like a good or
ganization in an army, are the expressions of
national character. Leaders will be developed
in military and in civil life alike: and weap
on* and tactics change from generation to
generation, m methods of achieving good gov
ernment change in civic affairs; but the
fundamental qualities which make for good
citizenship do not change any more than the
fundamental qualities which make good sol
diers. In the long run In the Civil War the
thing that counted for more than aught else
was the fact that the average American had
the fighting edge; had within him the spirit
which spurred him on through toil and dan
ger, fatigue and hardship, to the goal of the
rolendld ultimate triumph. So in achieving
good government the fundamental factor must
be the cnaracter of the average citizen; that
average citizen's Dower of hatred for what la
mean and base and unlovely; his fearless
scorn of cowardice and hits determination to
war unyieldingly against the dark and sordid
forceg of evil.
DUTIES OF CITIZENSHIP.
It now rests with us in civil life to make
good by our deeds the deeds which you who
wore the blue did in the great years from '61
to 'OS. The patriotism, the courage, the un
flinching resolution and steadfast endurance of
the soldiers whose triumph was crowned at
Appomattox must be supplemented on our
part by civic courage, civic honesty, cool san
ity, and eteadfast adherence to the immutable
laws of righteousness.
We take just pride in the great deeds of the
men of 1776. but we must keep In mind that
the revolutionary war would have been shorn
of well nigh all its results had the skle or
union and liberty been defeated in the Civil
War. In such ca*e we should merely have
added another to the lamentably long list of
cases in which peoples have shown that after
winning their liberty they* are wholly unable
to mske.cood use of it.
Every friend of liberty, every believer in
self-government, every idealist who wished to
see bis ideals take practical shaj>e, wherever
he might be In the world, knew that the suc
cess of all in which he most believed was
bound up with the success of the Union armies
In that great struggle. 1 confidently predict
that when the final judgment of history is re
corded it will be said that in no other war
of which we have written record was It
more vitally essential for the welfare of man
kind that victory should rest where It finally
rested.
It was because you. the men who wear the
button of the Grand Army, triumphed In those
dark years that every American now holds his
head high, proud in the knowledge that he be
longs to a nation whose glorious past and
great present will be succeeded by an even
mightier future.
GREAT ISSUES AT STAKE.
who fought here forty-one years ago have the
profound satisfaction of feeling that you play
ed well your i>art in one of those crises big
with the fate of all mankind. You men of
the Grand Army by your victory not only
rendered all Americans your debtors for ever
more, but you rendered all humanity your
debtors. If the Union had been dissolved, if
the great edifice built with blood and sweat
and tears by mighty Washington and his cmo
peÂ«rs had con" down in wreck and ruin, the
result would have been an incalculable calam
ity, not only for our people â and most of all
for those who. In such event would have
seemingly triumphed â but for all mankind.

The President passed the evening quiet
ly on his train at this station. Promptly
at 9 o'clock the train pulled out of Sharps
burg. It is due to arrive at Jersey City
to-morrow morning at 6 o'clock. ! The
President and party will go aboard the
naval yacht Sylph at 7 o'clock and ex

o'clock.
President with Governor Murphy, Sena
tors Kean and Dryden and accompanied
by General Carmen, who commanded the
Thirteenth New Jersey Volunteers in the
battle, visited the various points of In
terest on the historic field.
During the drive a singular fnct was
developed by the discussion of the battle.
It was that throughout the ceremonies
of the day, actively participated in en
tirely by citizens of New Jersey, with
the exception of the President, the name
of the commander of the division of
troops in the engagement. General George
B. McClellan, a citizen and afterward the
Governor of the State of New Jersey, was
not mentioned once. Governor Murphy
himself recalled this curious though quite
unintentional lapse and was concerned
deeply about the matter, les{ the omis
sion might be misconstrued. He w&rmly
eulogized McClellan as one of the great
commanders of the war and as a Gov
ernor of which New Jersey had reason
to be proud.

European powers would have recognized the

ACCEPTS GIFT FOR NATION.
Governor Murphy was accompanied by
Senators Kran and Drydon, by several
prominent State officials and by his en
tire military staff. The trip of the
dent from Jersey City was devoid of spe
cial incident. Many stops were made and
Ff-cret service officers were on guard
throughout the niuht.
At 10 o'clock the President and Gover
nor Murphy, accompanied by Senators
Kean and Dryden. the entire party and
hundreds of citizens, left Sharpsburg sta
tion for the famous Dunkard church on
the battlefield of Antielam. There the
brigades of veterans in columns of fours
escorted the President, Governor Murpny
and distinguished guests to the monu
ment. The monument is in the form of
Â¦ a Corinthian column of granite forty feet
high surmounted by a heroic figure in
bronze of an officer with upraised sword
leading his men in charge. The figure is
intended as a representation of Captain
It ish of the Thirteenth New Jersey Vol
unteors i who was the only New Jersey
offWr killed at Antictam.
After the assembly had been railed to
order by James O. Smith of the New
Jersey Monument Commission and an in
vocation had been pronounced by Rev.
Dr. Frazer of Newark. Mr. Smith re
r-ortfd to Governor Murphy the final work
of the commission. On behalf of the
Ftnte of New Jersey. Governor Murphy
accepted the monument in a brief ad
dress.
President Roosevelt as he arose to ac
cept the monument on behalf of the Fed
eral Government was accorded an ova

WASHINGTON, Sept. 17.-The Chinese
Minister called at" the State Department
to-day and laid before Acting Secretary
Adee a dispatch which he had recived
from the Chinese Consul General at San
Francisco, detailing an attack made last
night on a number" of Chinese at Tono
uah. Nrv.
The town in which the outrage has
been perpetrated is situated in Nye Coun
ty, Nevafifi, which in the end will proba
bly be called upon to pay indemnity for
the action taken by a few of the citizens
who have carried labor movements and
demonstrations in a high-handed man
ner. It is not believed by Lieutenant
Governor Allen that there will be any
further demonstration out that way, as
by this time the better classes of people
have the situation well in hand.
From the reports received it appears
that the movement for the expulsion of
the Chinese was in the hands of a few and
Â¦was not the Judgment of the best citi
zens of the camp. The peace officers were
powerless to resist the movement, but
since the expulsion of the Chinese several
of the ringleaders have been placed under
arrest.
HINGLEADEF.S IN JAIL.
As Governor Sparks was absent from
the State attending the National Irri
gation Congress at Ogden, Lieutenant
Governor Allen replied to the above tele
gram as follows:
CARSON CITT. Sept. 17. 1903.
To the Acting Secretary or State. Washing
ton, D. C. : Your telegram concerning the ex
pulsion of the Chinese from Tonopah has been
received. No official knowledge or complaints
have been presented to this offico. The matter
will be investigated according to law
? LEU ALLEN,
Lieutenant and Acting Governor.
His Excellency the Governor of Nevada, ,Car
son City: The Chinese Minister informs rr.e of
a telegram received from Tonopah, Nev., say
ing that on the night of Tuesday, the 15th, the
labor unions drove the Chinese people out Â°"
the town. Seven or eight were badly Injured,
one old man Is nearly dead and four are ml8s
lng. You are requested to take step3"for prompt
Investigation and due protection for the suffer
ers. AL.VET A. ADEE.
Acting Secretary of State.
CARSON. Nev., Sept. 17.â Meager de
tails of the outrage at Tonopah have been
received. Four of the Chinese who were
included in the expulsion are missing and
as the country they have to travel over
is desert it may be possible that they
have perished. That the Chinese know
something of their rights in a matter of
this character can be judged from the
fact that the Chinese Consul General at
San Francisco has already placed the
matter in the hands of the Washington
authorities and matters are already mov
ing for a thorough investigation of the
affair. The following despatches have
been received in this city: y
.WASHINGTON. D. C. Sept. 17. 190.1.
"Resolved, That the citizens of Tonopah
view with horror and denounce in un
measured terms the outrages and brutal
acts which according to all the present
evidence have been committed; that the
citizens of Tonopah regard this act as
not alone an atrocious violation of the
law, but also a heinous crime against in
offensive people, against humanity and
civilization; that the people of Tonopah
will support the officers of the law in all
possible ways in their efforts to bring the
criminals to justice."
REQUEST FOR GOVERNOR!
At a meeting of citizens, at which 1000
or .more were present, a committee was
appointed to frame resolutions denun
ciatory of the action of the mob. The
committee reported as follows:
, "Whereas, At a mass-meeting of the
citizens of Tonopah, Nev., held pursuant
to the call on Wednesday, September 16,
1803, a committee was authorized and ap
pointed to adopt resolutions denouncing
the action cf the mob which raided the
Chinese quarter of Tonopah on the night
of September 15, 1903, murdered an inof
fensive Chinaman, beat, mutilated and
terrorized a number of others and robbed
and otherwise maltreated them; therefore
we, the committee so appointed, hereby
present the following resolutions as ex
pressive of the sentiment of the people of
Tonopah in denunciation of said mob and
its atrocious work:
TONOPAH, Nev., Sept. 17.â The people
here are thoroughly aroused to the se
riousness of a mob's action on the night
of September 15. when an effort was made
to drive the Chinese from town. One old
Chinese was murdered, several were beat
en and robbed and others may be dead on
.the deiert. Information has reached here
that trie Chinese Minister at Washington
has asked for an investigation.

When President Roosevelt was speaking
rain began to fall in torrents. The stand
had a. canvas cover, but the water went
through It as If It were a sieve. When
a bystander offered to hold over him an

"I don't care for it. If (indicating the
assemblage) they can stand It, I can."

First as a spy,- later as chief of detec

forces, and finally, through the efforts, of
General J. Franklin Bell, with whom he
first served, and on the special recom

he was recently ordered to report to Leav

is expected to qualify him to hold the
position to which he has been appointed.

The programme was put through without

The nominees for Police Judges were in
the hall before the convention met, en

then took a Â«tand near the entrance and
when nominated gracefully retreated.
There were loud calls for the Judges, but
they could not be found. Some one in the

SELECTED FOR PLACES ON THE TICKET.
It Is only the so-called fancy toothpick
that is not made in this country. In Por
tugal, from where most of the orange
wood picks are imported, the sticks are
sharpened by young girls who. in return
for turninp out * picks" sharp as needles
and smooth as ivory, are paid 3 cents a
d:iy. The Japanese toothpicks are made
of fine reeds and are distinct from those
pent to this country by the Portuguese
manufacturers. A Japanese toothpick is
delicate and thin as tissue paper, and
nevertheless strong and pliable. The Jap
anese toothpick maker earns even less
than his Portuguese fellow craftsman,
his remuneration being but a fraction
mere than 2 cents a day. In short, a
thousand toothpicks may be bought' In
Japan for as much as It costs only to
pack and box 5000 of American make.â
New York Times.
The felling of toothpick lumber is only
Incidental to the regular, lumber work of
the M?ine foresters. No especial men are
t-eui out to hunt up suitable trees. But
whenever the foreman of a gang of
â¢noodsmen comes across a tree especially
adapted to toothpic*.:- he orders it felled
and laid aside. The branches ef the tree
are thtn trimmed ahd only the trunk Is
transported to the mills. There the bark
is ekinnfd and the naked trunk is run
through a machine which severs it into
venetrs. "Veneers" is the technical ex
pression for thin strips of wood no thick
er than a piece of blotting paper and no
wider than the length of a toothpick.
Once the trunk has been cut into these
sheets of wood, only one process remains
to turn out the toothpicks fit for packing
and shipping to market. The veneers are
f.-d into a second machine supplied with
Eharp rotary knives that whirl at tre
mendously high speed, snipping the
veneers into toothpicks at the rate of
hundreds of thousand an hour.
A further idea of the capacity of the
machines may be had from the fact that
Â«jrly ltf) men are necessary to operate and
run all the mills in Franklin County.
Other mills of this kind are scattered
throughout Pennsylvania and Mansachu
pttts and Western New York, but the real
home of the toothpick is in Maine. White
birch is not the only wood used for the
domestic toothpick; maple and poplar are
Â«rnployÂ»*d as well, but birch has the prop
erty of retaining its forest odor and
sweetness.
There is one article of manufacture that
is used extensively in the United States
that no one has an idea of the annual
quantity consumed, namely, wooden
louthpicks. According to an Â«xpert, the
number is pimply incalculable. Milions
\\>on millions of the tiny wooden slivers
are turrit d out every year from American
factories? alone, and on top of this tre
mendous output come importations from
Portugal and Japan and other countries
1 early aÂ« large as the domestic product.
Most of the American toothpicks come
'rum FrankMn County, in Maine, near th^
J< rost home of the white birch, out of
Â¦whkli J& per cent of the domestic tooth
picks arc- made. This wood is soft and
piiabie and of admirable resistance for the
purpose for which it Is used. Whole mills
in Maine are devoted to supplying the
country with toothpicks, and In the in
dustry 1Â« to be found some of the finest
and most intricate of machinery. So tre
mendous is the output of these machines
that in a brief season during the spring
trough "toothpicks can be made to supply
the markets of the entire country for the
><ar to come.
Miilrons of Them Are Manufactured
in America and More Im
ported.

Probably no famous bird has a smaller
habitat than the bird of paradise, whose
beautiful feathers are so highly prized In
the millinery trade. No one knows why
the varieties of this beautiful bird are
confined to the island of New Guinea
and the neighboring coasts of Australia.
There are many other Islands not far
away where the conditions would seem to.
be equally favorable to their existence,
but they are not found among them.
How astonished would the modern
French srirl be were she told not to take
the leading part in conversation, not to
giggle loudly, not to set her arms akimbo
and never to talk privately with a young
gentleman. -She would think such recom
mendations perfectly ridiculous as pre
venting all possible flirtations, for the art
of flirtation Is never at Its best unless
practiced in private. But forty years ago,
when parents deemed that marriage was
not a proper subject for the thoughts of
their daughters, flirtationâ even as a word
â was unknown in France. At that time
simplicity in dress was the order of the
day for young maidens, and even con
ferred a certain distinction, being carried
as far as possible among the aristocracy.
There were special light silks and Inex
pensive trinkets for jeunes filles, set with
corals, enamels and pearls, among which
the tiniest of diamonds would never have
been tolerated any more than costly
laces, furs or elaborate trimming.
At a glance It was easy to ascertain by
the style of dress whether a young wom
an was married or not, whereas It Is not
by any means so easy now, the same sat
ins, velvets, feathers and Jewels being
worn alike In both cases. And it is not
any easier to guess from the behavior in
society, for It may happen that the con
versation is taken up and carried on by
the girls in their desire to shine and to
attract attentionâ the married women be
ing silenced and ignored in the midst of
the excitement and amusement artfully
created by free sallies, unrestrained,
laughter and much attitudinizing.
No doubt the conventional restrictions
of forty years ago were somewhat ex
cessive and kept French girls till after
marriage In a state of prolonged child
hood; nevertheless it remains to be seen
whether the rapid change which has su
pervened is a real gain, for if it has rem
edied some evils of the old system it has
also engendered new ones, and on that ac
count many thoughtful French parents
are now seriously disquieted about the
future of their daughters.

Philadelphia will soon possess two of the
rarest coins known to exist. They are
the famous silver dollars of 1734. One is
at present in the Philadelphia Mint, and
the other was purchased last week by
Henry Chapman Jr., numismatist. The
latter coin was bought by Mr. Chapman
at the sale of the Murdock collection of
coins and tokens held In London last
week.
The dollar purchased by Mr. Chapman
surpasses the similar coin at the mint in
perfection and fineness. Mr. Chapman
wrote to the auctioneer hi advance that
he was willing to pay as high as COO for
the coin. It was knocked down to him
for Â£48. or J24O.

serving fcr two years.
Colvig lately returned from Barran
quilla, accompanied by his wife, and he
declares that no kind of a proposition
would Induce him to return. Those two
years he spent down there in the tropics
were two of the longest years of his life,
and for the good of his and Mrs. Colvig's
health he was obliged to resign. ,?p_~i
Life in Colombia is far from pleasant.
The extreme heat is one serious thing,
but there are countless other bad fea

per that composes it. The inhabitants
of the country are, for the greater part, a
shiftless lot.

The various platforms express approv
al of the- administration of Governor Dole
and recommendations are made that i
.-trong fight be made on the floor of the
next national Congress for the admission
of the Hawaiian Islands to statehood.
Several of the platforms urge that a de
termined cttuft be made to secure more
liberal Federal appropriations for the
Hawaiian Islands, much work of a neccs
j-sty character being neglected in the isl
ands for lack of means to properly carry
it on.
The various conventions nominated
mixed tickets, the natives running well
with the whites in the contests for places
on the tickets. In spite of the rivalry
which exists between the various fac
tions !n the Republican party the con
ventions were unusually harmonious in
their character. In but one county was
ihere any serious disturbance among the
delegates and candidates for office. At
Hilo the rivalry of the factions got be
yond the control of the chairman and a
brief war look place on the floor of the
several of the delegates, be
coming so embroiled as to engage in 'fis
ticuffs, with various unpleasant results
to the belligerents. Order was finally re
stored and the work of the convention
proceeded under more peaceful conditions.

The Fortieth District Republican dele
gation has agreed to recommend F. W.
Meyer for Supervisor.
Thomas D. RIordan, A. Ruef, John C.
Lynch, Henry Ach, David Rich and Jacob
Steppacher of the United Republican
League met at headquarters, 16 Geary
street, last evening. Quite a number of
delegates called during the evening to in
quire concerning the committee meetings,
and especially as to the meeting of the
convention's committee on permanent or
ganization and order of business. There
was talk last night to the effect that the
friends of C. A. Murdoch of the Fortieth
District would urge his nomination for
Mayor.
The advent of 'a new candidate, how
ever, would not be surprising. C. S. Lau
meister is supported by many active
friends who refer to his personal popu
larity, his wide acquaintance with the
people of the city, his high standing in
the business community and his extraor
dinary abilities and enterprise as a cam
paigner. During the prolonged hard
times in San Francisco Laumeister made
a legion ot friends by giving help and
extending credit to * poor families. His
friends say that he Is plain and approach
able and that if he were elected Mayor
one could call on him without appearing
in court costume. He has been urged to
accept the nomination for Assessor, but
his pojitical supporters maintain that he
ought to be placed at the head of the
Republican ticket. The contest for the
Mayoralty nomination, however, is free
for all. The man that the delegates se
lect will be accepted as the best man.
George Stone stands high In the estima
tion of the public and is a party leader
of courage and sagacity. His many sup
porters contend that his nomination
would be equivalent to election. They
assert that Republican merchants would
not leave the party to support an oppo
sition candidate in the event of General
Stone's nomination. . -..*.'-
The Twenty-eighth District delegation,
for instance, may come forward and pre
sent the name of a candidate who is
well known in the section of the city
where he resides. He may be honesl. ef
ficient and in every other sense worthy,
but if he i.Â« unknown at the Mission and
hardly ever heard of in the Western Ad
dition he will run behind his ticket. Dis
trict delegations will surely perceive that
succtFsful nominees for the Board of Su
pervisors must not only be good men, but
must be such as are known throughout
the v.-hole city to be good men.
The Republicans are quite confident
that their ticket will be elected on No
vember 2. Tha convention is composed
of men of character and intelligence, who
will consider the merits and availability
of every nominee. Several ballots may
bÂ«Â» taken before a candidate to head the
ticket is chosen. In the general discus
sion concerning the Mayoralty many well
known men have been mentioned, such
as General Shafter, Charles S. Laumeis
ter, C. W. Slack, A. B. Spreckels. Gen
eral Georse Stone, Reuben H. Lloyd,
Frank J. Symmes. F. W." Dohrmann, \V.
G. Stafford, William Cluff, John Lack
rr.ann, John C. Kirkpatrick, J. E. Mc-
Dougald, H. D. Loveland and H. J.
Crocker. Pressure of private business
and professional engagements have elim
inated several names from the list. There
is an imDression that the race will nar
row down to a contest wherein C. S. Lau
miister, John Lackmann, George Stone,
General Shafter and H. J. Crocker may
be represented by supporting delegations.
LATJMEISTER'S CHANCES.
The point is advanced by the advocates
of home rule that every alstrict contains
many citizens of high character, who are
qualified in every sense to serve as Su
pervisor, and therefore it would be un
fair and impolitic to give one district
two nominees for Supervisor en the same
ticket, because It would necessarily fol
low that some other district would go un
represented on the ticket so far as the
Board of Supervisors was concerned. As
all nominees are voted for at large, the
eighteen most acceptable to a majority
of the voters will be chosen, therefore
every district delegation should appre
ciate the importance of recommending to
the convention the best man In the dis
trict for the position. According to the
at large system of voting, it is almost
sure to happen that several districts will
fail to obtain resident representation in
the board. For example, say that the
Forty-first District in each of the thiee
party conventions should put forward a
man of exceptional fitness and popular
ity; three of the eighteen Supervisors
might be elected from that district. There
are many indications that the Repub
licans will elect a majority of the board,
and if each district should select a man
of exceptional ability and of wide and fa
vorable acquaintance, the entire eighteen
might be elected and resident represer.ia
tion be accorded to every district.
CONTEST FOR MAYOR.
The notion that each Assembly district
delegation in the convention will be au
thorized to name one nominee for the
Board of Supervisors seems to prevail.
The number of Assembly districts in San
Francisco corresponds exactly with the
number of Supervisors provided for in the
new charter. No doubt one could go into
two or three districts south of Market
street or in two or three districts north
of that thoroughfare and easily enough
select eighteen tlrst-class capable men for
the board, but such" selection would tend
to deprive a majority of the districts of
direct representation in the municipal
legislature.
HOME RULE PRINCIPLE.
The committee on platform and resolu
tions of the Republican local convention
expects to meet to-morrow evening. There
ic talk to the effect that the platform will
be brief and comprehensive. W. S. Wood

committee.

The Art of Traveling.
"Traveling is so easy nowadays"' is the
trite utterance of the tourist, and espe
cially of those who have learned to make
of travel one of the flno arts. But, like
all arts, it requires practice and familiar
ity with its laws. The difficulties made by
ttie untraveled over a little Journey and
their anticipatory fears and terrors are
still the fruitful theme for the story
writer. But the days when everybody
traveled with bird cage?, bandboxea and
lunch baskets are about over, and the
good traveler of these times is known by
the; absence rather than the presence of
baggage. Not only have people learned
to travel with ease, but they have discov
ered the necessity of imparting order and
design to their plans for Journeyings.
"I'm going to see my own country first,"
is the commendable decision of the wise,
prospective American traveler, who would
be ashamed to look upon London without
having first seen San Francisco, and
would scorn to confess to a Venetian that
he had never seen Boston. There is one
thing at least that travel will not doâ It
will not impart the gift of expression to
the traveler or relieve him of that de
spair of silence Into which so many, are
plunged. Change of scene may cure the
lover of his hurt or bring back the blush
of health to the worn-out man of busi
ness, but it will not put fresh words into
the mouths of those who are suffering to
reveal what they have seen and who fali
back upon that old complaint, | "I can't
describe it." It is words rather ' than
wealth that the accomplished traveler
needs in order that he may rely upon his
conversation more than tipon his camera
for the revelation of the scenes of His
travels.â Chicago Tribune.

.There are . many people who think that
much of .what Is real cuture and refine

that a diamond in the rough is the only

Glen was suddenly seized with illness.
The parents thought there was one last
chance to save their child and. hastily
hitching two horses to the lightest wagon
they could find, they started on their, long
ride to Vancouver. All the journey was
over rough and hilly country and scarcely
half the distance, was passed before dark
ness fell upon the racing horses.
While the mother tenderly cared for the
child the father lashed the team in the
feeble last hope . that all might still be
well. The child was still breathing when
the weary horses dragged the wagon into
the city, but death had really won the
race, for the baby died soon after it was
taken from the arms of tne despairing
mother.

Mrs. BishOD wrote him, telling him to

not the ring. After much questioning
Grider admitted that he had taken the
ring to Catallna Island. There he had
been induced to enter a poker game con

all his money and the Arizona man then
advanced him $350 on the ring, and he lost
that also.
After relating this story he asked the

would not be able to distinguish them

So, a man may be possessed of many

resulted in the finding of the body of the
boy at the bottom of the pool. All ef

A gentleman who toils seven hours per
day in the service of the Government is
keeping bachelor's hall this summer. His
family, consisting of a wife and three chil

Xew England wSods, while he, poor fel
low, has "no delicht to pass away the
time," save in the companionship of an
old chum, his classmate in college, and
also a toiler in one of the public depart
ments. This gentleman has the run of
the premises to the extent of being al
lowed a night key. and comes and go^s
as he pleases. He is an all-time bachelor,
not a summer bachelor, as is the gentle
man whose family are away. The other
day this friend, not feeling very well, re
mained away from his desk and about
noon sauntered over to the deserted man
sion, and not having indulged in break
fast, felt himself getting hungry and be
gan foraging through the pantries and

"No two people have feet formed exact
ly alike, and the shoe salesman who
thinks so and is governed accordingly
will meet up with many complaints. For
some time I pondered over the problem
of fitting shoes to feet, and especially as
to why the left foot should be considered
the standard by which to be governed.
The only rational theory 1 have ever been
able to evolve is a very simple one when
you come to consider it. Xine out of ten
people you meet are righthanded, as we
say. About one person in ten, or per
haps the per cent is even less than that,
uses his left hand. If you will observe a
person who uses the right hand when he
or she Is standing and talking, they In
variably rest their weight on the left
foot. And vice versa, a left-handed per
son will rest his or her weight on the
right foot. The result is that with right
handed people the left foot is probably
a fraction larger than the right foot, and
the shoe clerk must inevitably tind this
to be a fact sooner or later. That, in my
opinion, is the explanation of the common
belief that the left foot is the standard
to go by in the fitting of shoes. But as
I have already said, there is no rule that
is absolutely safe to follow, and my plan
is always to fit both feet before I let a
customer leave the house."â New Orleans
Times-Democrat.
"The question of which foot to fit first
is an Important one to us," said the shoe
salesman, as he tugged to get a small
pair of Oxfords on a large foot. "It may
seem strange to you, but it is rarely that
we- do not experience some trouble in
fitting one foot -while the other is easily
covered. A popular belief obtains that
the left foot of every person' Is the hard
est to fit and consequently many shoe
clerks always try a shoe on that foot first.
It is not true, however, according to my
observation, that there is any inflexible
rule as to Â¦which foot to try first. It is
true, nevertheless, that in a majority of
cases if you succeed in fitting the left
foot you will have no trouble with the
right. My practice is to try both feet
before I pronounce a pair of shoes a per
fect fit. Then I am sure of avoiding any
mistake growing out of peculiarities of
foot formation.

SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 17.â Great damage
is being done to timber land by the fierce
forest fire that has been raging in the
Santa Cruz Mountains. For a week the
blaze has been sweeping over the coun
try and showing no signs of abatement,
although large forces of men are at work
fighting it and reinforcements were sent
from this city to-day.
The mountains are entirely hidden from
view by day by the pall of smoke which
settles above them and at nieht the
flames can be seen on the ridges.
The territory burned over now covers
twenty miles, which means more than
three miles burned over in a day, the
greater part of it being virgin timber land
of redwood, fir, oak, madrone and other
woods. The fire started in the neighbor
hood of the Loma Prieta mill and spread
through the narrow and high Hlnckley
Gulch, covered with some of the finest
timber in the State. The greatest dam
age was done in the Valencia Gulch and
the F. A. Hihn Company are the biggest
losers.

FLAMES ON THE RIDGES.
The police were called and the silver
ware and sealskin were found tied up in
pilrow cases in a small room adjoining
the kitchen. The other property, however,
was carried off in the burglars' pockets.
It was found that the thieves had entered
through a small window that overlooks
an alley and which had been left un
locked. They probably entered the place
early in the evening, believing both of the
occupants to have gone out, and the
home-coming of Mrs. Botto interrupted
them in their work of plunder for a time.
It is possible that they remained on the
premises most of the night and were pre
paring to go with their loot when Botto
arose and frightened them away. The
precaution of Mrs. Botto in placing, her
jewelry under her pillow saved it for her,
as It is believed by the police that the
burglars prolonged their visit In an en
deavor to locate the valuables.
LOOT IN PILLOW CASES.
As Mrs. Botto was about to retire she
imagined she heard a noise in the house
and became nervous: She did. not desire
to awaken her husband to make a search
of the premises, but took the precaution
of placing most of her valuable rings and
gems under her pillow.
At 4 o'clock Botto arose to go downtown
and after striking a light observed that
the room had been ransacked and that
everything had been thrown about. He
called his wife, and together they went
through the house. Each room presented
the same appearance. Bureau drawers
had been opened, the contents of closets
thrown over the floor and evidence of a
most complete search was everywhere. As
they went along the merchant and his
wife observed what had been stolen.
About 5900 worth of silverware and a seal
skin pack valued at $100 were missing, also
the coin and a few articles of jewelry.
HIDES HER JEWELS.
Botto retired early Wednesday evening,
as he is required at his place of business
about 5 o'clock in the morning. His wife,
went to the theater and returned shortly
a/ter 11 o'clock.
Captain of Detectives Martin has two
cf his shrewdest men working on a daring
burglary that was committed early yes

was that of X. Botto, a commission mer
chant, at 1073 Union street, and the prowl
ers made a search of the entire house,
including the room in which Botto and
his wife were sleeping. The crooks had
plunder valued at about $1000 packed to
carry to the street, but were alarmed at
the rising of the merchant and were
obliged to leave it behind. They escaped,
however, with J90 in coin and some valu
able Jewelry.
SANTA ROSA, Sept. 17.â Word reached
this city to-night that the biggest forest
fire ever known in the county is now rag
fng close to the Sonoma and Mendoclrfo
line, between B'.ack Point and Gualala.
Five hundred men are out fighting the
flames and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that the big bridge spanning the
Gualala River and connecting the two
counties could be saved, thousands of
acres have been burned over and the fire
is not yet under control.

the outcome. Men are being hurried from
different sections to fight the flames.
Coney has had a misunderstanding with
those asociated with him in his mining
ventures in Arizona. When he saw the
report from Washington he at once piaceu
his affairs in the hanCs of a Tucson at
torney and left at 6 o'clock to-night for
San Francisco. He purchased a ticket to
L*>s Angeles and stated that he intended
poing from there to San Francisco by
boat.
"I returned to San Francisco after this
visit to General Diaz, and from there
srent to Chicago on mining business. In
Chicago I met some men interested in a
new mine and a proposed railroad in Ari
zona. I came directly to Tucson and have
LcÂ«n here three months looking into this
matter. I have been in constant corre
;-ponder.ce with President Diaz, and was
arranfiiig with a lav.- firm in the City of
Mexico to act as counsel for the proposed
railroad when I was advised by a repre
sentative of the company in the East
that work would have to be suspended
lor the present.
"My whereabouts has always been
known by General Diaz and by my fam
ily in San Francisco, and how such a re
port could originate I cannot imagine un
less it was started for the sole purpose of
injuring me by Mexican citizens high in
the diplomatic or consular corps in this
country."
CORRESPONDS WITH: DIAZ.
"I have received many favors at the
hands of President Diaz." said Coney,
"all because I saved his life in 1S7S. Jeal
ous Mexican citizens in the United States
have continually found fault with me un
til ray office in San Francisco was made
unendurable and I was forced to resign.
Five months ago I went to the City of
Mexico and presented my resignation in
person to President Diaz, and he at once
refused to receive it and only accepted it
when I had made clear the situation and
had shown him that it was utterly impos
sible for me to remain longer in the of
fice. At that time he expressed himself
as well satisfied with my conduct in of
fice.
Coney had net seen the report when
Fhown a copy of The Call containing the
Washington dispatch. He said the report
was utterly false and was originated
doubtlessly by some of his enemies among
the native Mexicans in this country, who
were hostile to him, because he was an
American and received favors at the
hands of President Diaz which they
thought they themselves should* receive.

asked the newspapers not to mention the
fact for business reasons. He has fre

All of this can be avoided,
however, by the use of Mother's Friend before baby comes, as this
great liniment always prepares the body for the strain upon it, and
preserves the symmetry of her form. Mother's Friend overcomes all the
danger of child-birth, and carries the expectant mother safely through
this critical period without pain. It is woman's greatest blessing.

Kearnjr tf-T tt t ITH the people of France the problem of
\j\l the low birth rate is about as absorbing as
â¢ Y is the negro . problem to the Southern
States, or. the growth .of Socialism in Germany.
Various have been the suggestions concerning it.
Some believe it to be a sign of a decadence of the
â¢s \ others deem it a proof of the advancing intelli
gence of the people. It seems to be conceded indeed
that the birth rate is lowest where average intelligence
is highest. Thus it is stated that a careful^ investiga
tion of the problem throughout France revealed that
the few places where the population is not diminish-,
ing are those where the working classes hfovÂ£ neither
the intelligence nor the leisure to take thought of the
future.
Some authorities . look upon a diminution in. the*
number of children among the poor as a distinct
benefit. A Dutch Minister of Finance is quoted as
saying: "No real amelioration of economic conditions
can be expected unless the number of births falls off
heavily. * * * Children are better cared for when
few in number; salaries and wages will increase as the
working population decreases;' mothers will be able
to tend their daughters more carefully."
Arguments of that kind are valid to a certain ex
tent, but experience on a large scale shows they are
not wholly reliable. Thus the condition of the work
ing classes in France is not better than that of simi
lar classes of workers in Britain and in Germany, and
yet in the last half of the nineteenth century the popu
lation of Germany increased 21,000,000 and that of
Great Britain increased 14,000,00b, while, the popula
tion of France increased only about 3,500,000. If
An aged negro living harmlessly in a Virginia
shack was murdered a few days ago by his ignorant
white neighbors, who believed him to be a sorcerer
and fit food for buckshot. This crime may suggest it
self as a reason for us to reform our complacent no
tion that we have progressed in any measurable de
gree from the atrocities of Salem .witchcraft days.
The recognized faculty of Californians to change
their environment, if they cannot .adapt it to their
uses, and to build out of an unfortunate situation a
structure of hopes and aspirations, has had another
conclusive demonstration. A prisoner in Yreka jail
recently made himself a set of keys and unlocked
himself to freedom.
It is a pity that the only thing-Sir Thomas Lipton
has caught in the United States is an aggravated case
of 'appendicitis. It is sincerely to be hoped that the
distinguished visitor .will carry it away only as an un
pleasant memory flitting across recollections of an
otherwise enjoyable visit.
Two Pennsylvania men contracted hydrophobia' a
few, days ago in a kiss.' And the strangest part bf
the unfortunate affair is that no Philadelphia girls are
involved in it. â¢ The incident,: however, has not yet
been catalogued as one of the oddities of Pennsyl
vania life.
RACE bUICIDE AGAIN.
It begins to look as if Russia's promise to evacuate
Manchuria is intended as a huge, diplomatic, practical
joke. It appears to be all the more practical, as the
nations that are able to resent it won't, and those
that want to cannot. The lesson which Russia is
teaching in the affair is of marked- value,- as it may
teach Japan the funny side of things.
GREEKS AND BULGARIANS
A RECENT dispatch from Sofia says: "The first
indication of the Greeks aiding the Bulgarians
against Turkey appears in a circular addressed
by the general stall of the eighth revolutionary dis
trict to the Gretk towns and villages in the vilayet of
Adrianop'c. It expresses pleasure at hearing that the
Greeks desire to join their Bulgarian brethren in the
tight for liberty and invites the Greeks to send dele
gates to confer with the Bulgarians to formulate
}â¢ ans for joint action.'" The dispatch goes on to add:
"' i he mixed population of Greeks and Bulgarians in
fifteen villages of the province of Kostur have joined
tii- insurgents.*!
Those reports are stricjly of the kind long since de
scribed as "important if true." Were the Greeks to
join hands with the Bulgarians residing in Macedonia
the end of Turkish rule would be near at hand and
the great powers would have to agree upon a pro
gramme and get their armies in motion at once if
they wished to save the entire Balkan peninsula from
devastation. It is not at all likely, however, that any
considerable number of Greeks will aid the Bul
garia!:?, for they have aims and aspirations concern
ing Macedonia themselves, and those aims would be
seriously compromised by Bulgarian success. As a
matter of fact if the Greeks be compelled to take sides
in the contest they will most likely be found on the
side of the Moslem fighting against their Christian
brethren, the Bulgarians.
The issue is one of politics. It is evident that the
rule of the Turk in Macedonia and Thrace cannot en
dure much longer. That vast and important coun
try, carrying Â»vith it access to the Mediterranean and
to the Black Sea, control of the Bosphorus and pos
session of Constantinople, must sooner or later pass
into new hands. Should they succeed in annexing it
to their country the Bulgarians would be in a position
to build up a first-class power and perhaps in the end
annex Greece to their kingdom. On the other hand,
should the Greeks fall heir to' the Turk they would
add enormously to the prestige of Greece and give
l*er an opportunity for national expansion. Hence*
between the Bulgarians and the Greeks there is no
more probability of an alliance than there is between
two rival claimants to the heritage of a big estate that
cannot be divided.
Greece has had one tu?sle with the Turk and has
co <iesire for another. Bulgaria left her to fight that
battle alone and she will serve Bulgaria in the same
fashion. As between the two races it is not easy to
decide which is the worthier of the empire for which
they arc intriguing and struggling. It is said that in
Macedonia and Thrace there are about four times as
many Greeks as Bulgarians, and on that showing
they would have'the better right to the land. It ap
pears, however, that the Bulgarians while in a minor
ity are a much more vigorous people and therefore
better fitted to rule. . Neither is likely to succeed
against the Turk while acting alone, and in that fact
lies the temporary salvation of the Sultan.
A recent review of the situation says: "If aspira
tions for the political and economic growth of Bul
garia are ever to be realized the state must touch
some other sea than the Euxine, which is now vir
tually a Russian lake. Access to the Aecean would
at once raise Bulgaria in importance and power by
giving it both a Black Sea and a Mediterranean lit
toral, while on the north for hundreds of miles it
flanked the Danube. Greece, already pushed so far
down the Hellenic â¢ peninsula that its economic
strength is too slight to maintain the burden of inter
national rivalries, would be threatened with suffoca
tion, and the statesmen of modern Hellas are thus
more reconciled to the continued domination of the
Turk, tinder the Jieavy restraining hand of Europe,
than to the possible expansion 'of a rival Christian
state in a region that the Greeks themselves much
covet." .*-*.
The rivalry between the Greeks and the Bulgarians
has not been concealed on either side. It was only a
short time ago that one o^ the leading statesmen of
Greece, ex-Premier Zaimis, was quoted as saying that
Greek sympathies are with the Turks and that Greece
would cooperate with the Sultan if necessary to sup
press the Macedonian insurrection. Such are the
facts that give interest to the Sofia report that a num
ber of Greeks have joined with the Bulgarian insur
cents. It is big news if it be true.
WILLITS EXCURSIONISTS
ARE PROMISED SEATS
Interest Is Excited JÂ»y Forthcoming
Sale of Lands at New Railway
Terminus.
Colonel W. II. Menton, manager of the
country land department of the Burnham
& Macsh Company, reports that there Is
lively interest in the property at WilMts,
which is about to be placed on the mar
ket. This is justtfled, he says, for the
reason that the former terminals of the
San Francisco and Northwestern Rail
wayâCloverdale and Uklahâ grew from
towns as small as Willlts to cities, and
Willits has advantages that neither of
the other cities mentioned possessed.
Colonel Menton says tnat he will see
personally that each arid every one who
goes on the excursion train to Willits
next Sunday to view the property is pro
vided with a seat.
Telegraph Hill Improvement.
The matter of preserving and beautify
ing Telegraph Hill and ultimately turning
it into a public park was before the exec

tective League last night. The commit
tee decided to call a mass meeting of the
residents and property owners of the
North End next Thursday evening at
Washington Square Hall, when their
conclusions and recommendations will be
submitted for approval. On that occa
sion Captain Robert H. Fletcher will give
a lecture and exhibit stereoptlcon views
showing the improved hills of foreign
lands, and will tell how Telegraph Hill
may be made* one of the most picturesque
spots in the city. Members of the Wom
an's Club will be represented at the meet-
Ing, and besides. Captain Fletcher there
will be other speakers of prominence.
Injured Persons Want Damages.
Two suits for damages were filed yes
terday, one by Samuel Macauley against
the Oceanic Steamship Company and the
other by Clara Bach against the Califor

cauley asks for $10,000 for injuries received
on board the steamer Sonoma and Mrs.
Bach seeks $10,200 for Injuries received
while she was a passenger on an O'Far
rell-street car last August.

Probing Into the causes underlying the
phenomena of thought-transference, mes
meric Influence, spirit communication and
all the phases of occultism is something:
that Is attracting the thoughtful at- the
present time. The world Is having what
may be termed a "psychic revival."
Every one, however practical, is anxious
to know something of the hidden causes
that make these phenomena possible. Dr.
Mclvor-Tyndall's demonstrations are
based on scientific facts. His theories are
presented in a convincing way, explain
ing many of the obscure phases of mental
and psychic science.
"Hypnotismâ Good and Bad" will be the
subject of Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall's Sunday
night lecture at Steinway Hall. There
are many erroneous ideas in regard to the
good and bad effects of hypnotism, and
those who attend Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall's
demonstration Sunday will doubtless be
rewarded with much enlightenment on
this strange power. The lecture Is arous
ing a great deal of Interest, and Steinway
Hall will doubtlessly be packed to the
doora. Reserved seats can be secured at
"That Man Pitts," 1008 Market street.
After the talk Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall will
give a demonstration of the powers of the
sub-conscio\is mind, illustrating the prin
ciples of mental wireless telegraphy.
The public Is frequently startled by the
claim of some culprit or criminal that he
was hypnotized to commit the act for
which he la in custody. Those who are
supposed to know generally declare that
It Is impossible to hypnotize a person so
as to make him do anything he would not
doln the normal state. Altogether there
Is more diversity "of opinion regarding
this one phase of occultism than any
other subject in which the public is In
terested.
Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall Will Lecture on
This Puzzling Force Next Sun

IN HYPNOTIC MATTEKS
Preparations for infusing a national significance
into the local fight are being vigorously, carried out.
The New York Sun says: "Leader. Charles F. Mur
phy has had long talks on this subject with David B.
Hill, Senator Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland,
Chairman James K. Jones of the Democratic National
Committee, Senator Joe Bailey of Texas and Senator
Clark of Montana, and lie expects soon to have-a talk
with Senator William J. Stone of Missouri. Mr.
Jones is to be succeeded in the next , Democratic
national convention, possibly by Senator Stone or
James M. Guffey of Pennsylvania, as chairman of the
Democratic National Committee. Senator Clark is
also mentioned for the place. The conferences with
Mr. Hill, it was said, occurred at Albany, while those
with Senators Gorman, Clark and Bailey and Mr.
Jones have taken place here. * * * Leader Mur
phy's talks with these national Democrats, it was
learned, is for the purpose of giving to the Demo
cratic city fight this fall a national flavor, which in a
measure will set the keynote for/ the Democratic con
ventions to be held next spring for the election of
delegates at large to the Democratic national con
vention."
Calling men from Texas, Montana and Missouri,
to say nothing of those from Maryland, into consul
tation over a city election in New York shows a de
gree of activity on the part of the Eastern Demo
cratic leaders that it behooves Bryan to watch closely.
He and his followers won the fight against thcreor
ganizers in Ohio, and Tom Johnson stands there as
a triumphant exponent of the Kansas City platform;
but Tammany may manage to make a showing this
fall that will offset that of Ohio. There is very little
likelihood that Johnson will be elected in Ohio, and
consequently if the Tammany Democrats, represent
ing the Eastern wing of the national party, win out
against Low the chances of the Bryanites in the na
tional'convention would be seriously impaired. The
tactics of Tammany arc therefore wisely adopted.
In the first place they avoid a straight fight against
Mayor Low on local issues, and in the second place
they afford an opportunity for parrying the Bryan
blow in Ohio, each of which is good politics from a
Tammany standpoint.
OF the,,electons to take place this year it may
be said there will hardly be more than a local
interest in any except the State contest in
Ohio and the city election in New York. The Ohio
campaign is raised above the level of a strictly State
issue by the appearance of Tom Johnson in the field
as a Democratic candidatefor. Governor. It is well
known that he cares for that office only as a point of
vantage from which to make a fight for the Presi
dential nomination of his party next year. Thus
while his platform carefully excluded all reference to
national affairs beyond a vague denunciation of im
perialism and trusts, the campaign none the less takes
rank among the national issues of the time.
In New York city the contest, like that in Ohio,
will have more or less effect upon national pofitics.
In fact it is reported to be the aim of the Tammany
leaders to make the fight one of national rather than
of local politics, thqs reversing the tactics of Johnson,
who seeks to avoid the strength of the Republican
position on national issues by making a fight on State
issues only. Tammany evidently believes the reform
administration of Mayor Low to be too strong for a
direct assault, and accordingly the plan is to raise
some kind of a strictly partisan issue and thus rally
all Democrats of whatever class to support the ticket
on election day.

A garden fete for the benefit of the
San Francisco Presbyterian Orphanage
and Farm of San Anselso Is to be held
October 3 in the beautiful grounds of
Mrs. A. E. Kent at Kentvllle. The women
that guide the affairs of this excellent in
stitution are sparing no effort to make
the fete yield a profitable sum to~~its
rather depleted treasury, and to that end
are planning many attractive features,
no word of which will be divulged until
the day is near. Surely there Is no char
ity that appeals so universally to the
heart as that which extends Its protecting
hand over homeless little ones.
The gardens of Mrs. Kent are beautiful
ly wooded and replete with shady nooks;

Deducting the coal and similar raw products of the
soil from the exports, Mr. Palgrave shows that the
entire manufactured exports increased in value dur
ing the twenty years under review only to the amount
of Â£15,000,000. He then adds: "Meanwhile our ex
ports of the irreplaceable mineral wealth of the coun
try had increased about Â£22,000,000 in that time. Man
ufactured goods can be made, but mineral products
once extracted from the earth can never be replaced.
It is difficult to realize this. It means that we are
now selling every year so much of the soil of Great
Britain as is equal in value to one of our counties."
To those and similar arguments of the advocates of
protection the free traders reply by asking upon what
class of imports they purpose to place the proposed
duties. Then they submit an analysis of the imports
of the United Kingdom in this table:
Per Cent
of Total.
1. Food 44.S
2. Liquor 1.5
3. Raw materials for use In Industry 28.S
4. Crudely manufactured ma,ter!alB for use In In
dustry 5.4
5. Wholly manufactured materials and plant for
use in lndustrv 8.0
6. Domestic appliances and personal necessaries... ' 5.4
7. Luxuries 5.4
8. Miscellaneous 2.6
Total 100.0
There in a nutshell is the argument aeainst Balfour:
Upward of 85 per cent of the entire imports are made
up of food products or of raw material necessary to
the industries of the people. Upon which of these
classes will the protectionists place their tariff? That
is the issue that confronts John Bull and it is not at
all surprising that he is worried about it.
A crumb of comfort is offered to the free traders
in the statement that the excess of imports over ex
ports is not a sign of decline in British wealth or of
a consumption of capital. Thus it is said that while
the excess yearly averages about $800,000,000, the in
come receivable from foreign investments, calculated
at $312,560,000, added to the earnings of the British
merchant fleet engaged in foreign trade, calculated at
$450,000,000, "is probably more than sufficient to ac
count for' the average excess of imports." !
While it is unquestionably true that a large per
centage of the excess of British imports over exports
is paid out of revenues derived from foreign invest
ments and from freights paid for shipping, it is doubt
ful if the free traders can maintain the doctrine that
the whole of the excess is thus paid for. The current
number of the National Review present* a strong ar
ray of arguments on the other side and submits a
series of tables of comparative statistics showing that
the consumption of capital is actually going on and at
a portentous rate.
Discussing the subject "Are We Consuming Our
Capital?" one of the writers for the Review, R. H.
Inglis Palgrave, says of the trade between 1881 and
1891: "People generally assume that we must have
made what we sell. The figures for 1881,
1891 and 1001 are Â±234,000,000, Â£274,000,000, Â£280,000,
000. This looks like a satisfactory increase, nearly
Â£50,000.000 in twenty years. But these figures include
coal exported. Coal is taken as illustrative of this
class of goods. * * * Coal is merely a raw prod
uct extracted from the soil, not a manufactured article
at all."
CLOSELY following the publication of Bal
four's pamphlet on "Insular Free Trade"
comes the publication of the blue book of
the British Board of Trade containing statistics
which, show various aspects of the trade and the in
dustries of the- country. In hardly a single respect is
the showing encouraging to the advocates of the ex
isting fiscal policy, for the sum total of the whole is
a renewed revelation that the imports of the country
are increasing in a much larger percentage than the
exports and that. to some extent at least the British
of this generation are consuming their capital.
. Some of the significant figures of the report are
those showing- that in the period between 1890 and
1902 the total exports to foreign countries actually
diminished to the amount of $90,000,000, while the im
ports steadily increased. In the trade with the
United States the change brought about during the
period was remarkable, for exports from Great Brit
ain to the United States declined in that time from
$I45,ooo,tx>o to $97,000,000, while imports from the
United' States rose from $585,000,600 to $635,000,000.
It is further noted that the proportion of the United
Kingdom exports; as between protected and unpro
tected countries, in the markets of the world, has
been reversed since 1850. Then it was 56 per cent to
the protected countries and 44 per cent to the others.
In x 1902 the proportion was 42 per cent to the pro
tected countries and 58 per cent to the others.

I large families meant inevitable distress aiJd wretched
ness among the poor the* British and the German
workers ought now to be in a condition much lower
than the French workers, but they are not.
The latest effort to explain the diminished birth
rate of the French is made in La Nouvelle Revue by
Ernest Laut. He holds the Government responsible
and insists that taxation is so high that it is impossi
ble to bring up a big family in France on the ordi
nary wages of the working classes. After reviewing
the various l schemes that have been suggested as
means of increasing the birth rate he says: "What
are all these projects of laws of heritage, these prom
ises of official favors or decorations, to the father of a
family, crushed by taxes and groaning under his bur
den? Not so long ago the pride of race and patriot
ism sufficed. The father was not content to beget'
children; he made sacrifices in' order to. rear them.
And what gratitude did the state, which took them,
show him? None. Finally he' found out that he
was being duped. From this discovery came the
trouble which France is meeting now. Man, after
all, is made in the image of society; the egotism of
the one has made the other egotistic. Make law-s and
speeches.' appoint commissioners, assemble con-,
gresses, institute decorationsâ it will â¢ do no_ good.
France will continue to lose in population so long as
the state burdens large families by reason* of their
very size, so long as the citizen is sacrificed to the
needs of a narrow political principle, so long, in a
word, as the people are oppressed instead of pro-,
tected."

SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 17.-Henry
Umfrled and W. H. Greer of "West River
side have returned from the desert and
tell of an experience they had with an
Jniiiitn north of Manvel. They had gone
to a region where Umfried had been two
years ago, expecting to locate placer
fields. When Umfried was first In the
region he found an abundance of water
and so on this second visit he qnd Greer
made no preparations for an emergency
and had the bad luck to find the springs
nothing but dry hole*. They suffered
greatly from thirst and at last turned
their pack animals loose, believing they
would instinctively find water.
The men were too exhausted to keep
up with the animals and next day, when
about re-ady to end their misery by self
destruction, an Indian came along with
their animals. He demanded that they
turn over their outfit to him and give
him money, which they did, before he
would guide them to a waterhole.
The experience was all they wanted and
they prevailed upon the Indian to guide
them back to the nearest trail. The sec
tion where they were lost Is scattered
with volcanic rock, but in many of the
canyons there are good indications of
placer gold.. From Umfried's description
of the place it is evidently in t'he neigh
borhood where John Vv'ard of San Ber
nardino was lost some time ago.

for a Methodist Episcopal clergyman's
pastorate over any church will expire
next year, so the most the Pomona Meth
odists could hope for would be one more
year of residence here by Dr. White.
The Rev. Dr. White Is considered one
of the strongest men in his denomination
in Southern California. He was born in
Valparaiso, Ind., in 1S58. He was gradu
ated at Cornell Coliese, in Iowa, in 1S83,
and upon finishing his theological course
became financial agent for Cornell Col
lege* His healtn broke down from over
study and he came to -alifornta In 1SS8.
For a. year he was idle. Then he was
appointed to the pastorate of the Alham
bra Methodist Church. In that little
church he fjuickly made a reputation by
reason of his excellence in public speak
ing and his earnestness. From Alhambra
he was sent to the Fallbrook (San Diego
County) church for two years; thence to
Sen Bernardino. -There he raised a debt
of $2S.0CO upon the Methodist Episcopal
church and in twenty months added over
200 new members to the church rolls.

POMONA, Sept. 17.â The Central
Methodist Episcopal Church In
San Francisco has siprnlfied its
desire to Bishop Cranston that
the Rev. Dr. George W. "White
of Pomona be transferred from Southern
California and be appointed to the pas
torate of the Central M. E. Church in
that city. The Bishop has acceded to the
request, and Dr. White has notified his
Pomona congregation that he will remove
to San Francisco immediately after the
close of the present annual conference
in uo% Angeles, and will occupy the pul
pit at the Central Church on the first
Sunday in October.
The Pomona Methodist Episcopal Church
is very sorrv to lose Dr. White as its
pastor. Under his pastorate during the
last four years the .. local church has
grown faster in membership and influ
ence than any similar organization in that
region. The five-year limit of residence

extend Mr. Erwin a benefit entertainment
to be hold in the near future.
Resolved. That the California Camera Club
hereby places on record its sentiment of highest
regard and estepm for the character and prin
ciples of Mr. Krwiry and hereby further gives
expression of Its fuflest confidence in his integ
rity and honor, and perfect reliance in his un
swerving fidelity to any trust reposed in him.
President A. L. Coombs occupied the
chair, and upon opening the meeting read
numerous letters and telegrams from
those members who were unable to at
tend but who took those methods of ex
pressing their approval of the gathering
and sympathy with the object in view.
By a unanimous vote the following res
olution was adopted:
Whereas, For many years past James W.
Erwin has been an active member of the Cali

terms ha.Â« acted as its president, during all of
which time we, his fellow members, have had
ample opportunity to judge of his character and
integrity; and.

Inspector Munro says he did not know
whether any special appointee would ever
be sent out to fill the position now ren
dered vacant. The work will now be done
by the different officers in the postal in
spection service. ,
Munro had already made an application
to the Government for another inspector,
as the number is inadequate to keep up
with the growth of the postal require
ments here. Should Erwin be vindicated
at his coming trial there is no reason to
suppose that he could not be reinstated
to the position. Attorney Knight is con
fident that the evidence he is securing
will prove his client's innocence. Among
the numerous names appearing on the
back of the warrant as having given
testimony which led to the issuance of
the indictment papers that of Richardson
is the only one known to Erwin, and
Richardson is the only one with whom the
ex-postal inspector Is acquainted. Some
of the others he has heard of, but has
never met them or in any way been Iden
tified in business transactions of any sort
with them. It would therefore seem prob
able that the indictment was issued en
tirely upon the statements made by Rich
ardson. What those statements were is
still a mystery.
The whereabouts of Richardson is still
unknown to the general public. When he
left here four weeks ago he announced
his intention of returning about this time
and stated that he thought he would take
the trip home in a leisurely manner and
would probably return over the Xorthern
Pacific.

Mrs. Saunders, whose name oft the
stage was Anderson, was the grand old
lady of ihe stage twenty years ago, as
Mrs. Gilbert is to-day. Time was when
her name alone was a leading feature of
playtfills throughout the country, and her
rendition of old women's parts was con
sidered without a peer. A cousin of the
great Joseph Jefferson and of William
"Warren, the famous character actor, Mrs.
Saunders was= an intimate also of the
grfat Booth and Barrett..
Mrs. Saunders first appeared before the
footlights fully fifty years ago, while yet
in short dresses. Her young womanhood
wss spont in the carkins grind of barn
storming companies. The stage coach and
the river steamer were often the only
means of transportation between one
night ptandF. Her life was a hard one
and succors was slow In coming. It was
not until she had become a woman past
the prime when success came to crown
her early efforts.
As the portrayer of old women Mrs.
Saunder? began to win a great reputation
during the '70s. The part of the nurse in
"Rom?o and Juliet," Mrs. Malaprop of
"The Rivals" and the old woman in "The
Jewess"" were her leading roles. She was
a favorite* at the old Baldwin and Califor
nia theaters in this city. She had the
distinction of holding the part for Edwin
Booth at his first production of "Hamlet"
in the old Star Theater, New York.
L. R. Stockwell played with her in "The
Jewess*? Just before she retired from the
stage, almost twenty years ago. Since she
forsook the footlights Mrs. Saunders has
played the part of fairy godmother to all
of the younger actors of the coast, and
by her gentleness has fixed herself for
ever in the whole-souled appreciation of
the actor world.
Very near to the ringing down of the
last curtain, Mrs. Elizabeth Saunders, the
beloved old actress of a past generation,
lies grievously ill at her home. 510 Capp
Ftreet. For nine weeks she has been
bravely fighting against a severe attack
of bronchitis and asthma, which has
wasted her strength to such an extent
ttat Dr. T. G. Inman, her physician,
slites that it is only a matter of a few
days before her life will end.

Health and beauty are the glories of perfect "womanhood. Women
Â¦who suffer constantly with weakness peculiar to their sex cannot re-
tain their beauty. Preservation of pretty features and rounded form is
a duty women owe to themselves.
When women are troubled "with irregular, suppressed or painful
menstruation, weakness, leucorrhoBa, displacement or ulceration of the
womb, that bearing down feeling, inflammation of the ovaries, back-
ache, bloating (or flatulence), general debility, indigestion, and nervous
prostration, or are beset with such symptoms as dizziness, faintness,
lassitude, excitability, irritability, nervousness, sleeplessness, melan-
choly, '* all gone " and M want-to-be-l^ft-alone " feelings, blues, and hope-
lessness, they should remember there is one tried and true remedy.
Lydia E. Pinkhaixfs Vegetable Compound removes such troubles.
Case of this Prominent Chicago Woman Should Give Everyone
Confidence in Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
" Dear Mes. Pinkham : â It affords me great pleasure, indeed, to add my
testimonial to the great number who are today praising Lydia E. I*ink-
liamN Vegetable Compound. Three years 'ago I broke down from ex-
f-Sgt&k cessive physical and mental strain. I was unable to
Â«pg3S|g-K secure proper rest, also lost ray appetite, and I became so
j^SpBSlillJok nervous and irritable too that my friends trembled, and
/6pÂ£SjgK?|i ga|K I was unable to attend to my work. Our physician pre-
/flMiS*^^ ggBa scribed for me, but as I did not seem to improve, I was
Tg|ap' >gp3| advised to go away. I could neither spare the time nor
g^^. f^L &M money, and -was very much worried when, fortunately,
L tcst^M c * ne Â°' â¢y club friends called. She told me how she had
l^k jLÂ«X W Â°eencuredof ovarian troubles, and how like my symp-
I \Â£?^ yX * om9 vrere hers, seven bottles of vour medicine eared
1 jgfijK^ ><v\. her, and she insisted that 1 take some.
Sj| jK^C^v^^vVv "' I did so. and am plad that I followed her
jSfcljaa a""*^^ ;uv *>j#v^v advice. Within six weeks I was a different
'^^r^^^^^''''^''^y\ woman > strono- and robust in health, and have
////^^^^^i^^^ )een s Â° ever since -
W^B^^^^^jij^^^^^B*^^ " A number of my friends who have been
' i^'/\ troubled with ailments peculiar to our sex
(&' ffirf^xrf--Â£&'\ 'Â¦"'' 'Â¦' have takÂ»n your compound, and h3ve also been
* greatly benefited." â AI139 Elizabf.tq Dalet,

resters, Catholic.
What is left for the women of America, after reading such letters
a3 we publish, but to believe. Don't some of you who are sick and miser-
able feel how wicked you are to remain so, making life a burden for
yourself and your friends, when a cure is easily and inexpensively
obtained ? Don't vou think it would pay to drop some of your old
prejudices and "Try Lydia E. Pinkliara's Vegetable Compound,
which is better than all the doctors for cures ? " Surely the experience
of hundreds of thousands of women, whom the Compound has cured,
should convince all 'we men.
Follow the record of this medicine, and remember that these curea
of thousands of women whose letters are constantly printed in this
paper were not brought about by "something else," but by Lydia B.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, the great Woman's Remedy for
Woman's Ills. " t
Those women who refuse -to accept anything else are rewarded a
hundred thousand times, for they get what they want â a cure, floral
â siiek to the medicine that you know is the Best. Write to Mrs.

There is a family named Fennen living
In the north of England, whose original
name was Purvis. Two ' hundred years
ago Frank Purvis turned pirate and was
killed fighting on his ship. The family
then decided to relinquish the name of
Purvis and take that of Fennen.. and ever
since the eldest son of the family, on
attaining his majority, signs a pledge that
he will not resume the name of Purvis.
The pledge has been handed down from
father to son and bears some fifty signa
tures ; . . '.
The suit of Mrs. Jennie Wh|te to re

was the Lewis and Clark stake, for 2:25
trotters, which was marred after the sec
ond heat by the ruling off the track of "WV
G. Durfee, the lessee of Sweet Marie.,
which is owned by William Garland of
Los Angeles. The judges charged Durfee
with pulling Sweet Marie and allowing
Dr. Hammond to take the heat. On ac
count of the value of Sweet Marie, Durfee
would not allow the substitution of an
other driver, and withdrew her. This the
Judges maintain he had no right to do. It
is expected both Durfee and the mare
will be ruled off the tracks of the Ameri
can Trotting Association. Results:

George Adrian, who was treasurer of
the picnic committee of the Barbers' Lo
cal Union No. 148, was on trial before Po
lice Judge Mogan yesterday on a charge
of misdemeanor embezzlement. He was
accused of having been 150 short in his
accounts, and last June he signed an
agreement to pay back the money. Yes
terday he presented an offset, embracing
charges for going to Oakland several
times in connection with the picnic and
collecting money, but the Judge decided
that the offset was not made in good
faith. Adrian was convicted and was in
formed that If he did not pay back the
amount he would spend some months in
the County Jail.
Treasurer's Accounts Short:.
S. J. Robinson, a switchman, was found
lying on . the sidewalk at Montgomery

His diamond locket, gold fob and $10 70
which he had in a small pocket of his

was drinking: a glass of wine in a saloon
on Pacific street and he thought the wine
had been drugged. Captain Martin was
notified.
Says He Was Bobbed.

evidence, Judge Seawell yesterday amend
ed his findings In the suit of J. A. Whit
ney to declare the recent Bpeclal tax levy

The Pollard Lilliputian Opera Com
pany presented "The Geisha" at the
Grand Opera-house last night to a large
and highly delighted audience. This at
tractive company of little people showed
to excellent advantage in the beautiful
Japanese idylic musical comedy. It was
beautifully staged and costumed. The
scenery was painted in Kobe, especially
for the lllllputlans when they were tour
ing Japan four months ago. It is very
handsome and picturesque and naturally
Japanesque In the extreme. In fact, the
whole atmosphere of the performance
smacks of the land of the home of the
chrysanthemum. The piece is well acted
and sung throughout, none of the musical
numbers being omitted.
Miss Alice Pollard was a very graceful
and dainty O Mimosa San and sang her
two solos, "Amorous Goldfish" and
"Jewel of Asia," charmingly. Little
Daphne Pollard reveled in the role of
Mollie Seymour. The part Is exactly
suited to her style and she captivated her
audience from the start by her cute antics
and winning ways. She was irresistible in
"The Toy Duet" with Ivy Pollard and
was very funny in her solo, "Monkey on
a Stick."
Fred Pollard was in fine voice and sang
his solo, "Star of My Soul," so well that
he received a double encore.
As was to have been expected, little
Teddy McNamara, as Tom Stanley,
caused a laugh every time he made a
speech. He was one of the funniest char
acters in the whole show.
Irene Gouldlng was a capital Dick Cun
ningham in every way. She looked well,
acted well and eangr her solo, "Jack's the
Boy," in a rollicking fashion.
The chorus was up to the mark and
was thoroughly well trained and drilled.
"The Geisha" will be given- to-night,
Saturday night and at the matinee to
morrow, when a photograph of little
Daphne Pollard will be presented to every
child in the house.

Double playâ Delma* to Raymond to Pabst.
Time of RamÂ«> â One hour and forty minutes.
Umpire â McDonald.
In every inning the old-timer had the
home # players on hi3 staff. They got a
run in thu fourth on an error and a bad
play by Townsend, but they made no hits.
In the ninth inning Delmas walked. As
the fans were getting ready to leave the
place Henry Lynch advanced with his
club and without any ceremony hit the
ball out of the lot over the left field fence.
It was the longest drive of the year and
possibly the longest in the history of the
grounds, barring one made by "Chick"
Stahl of Boston back in 'H7.
It was too bad that there were not
more runners on the bags at the time. As
it was two were out and the next man up,
Pat Meany, did not make good with a
safe drive, so it was all over then and
the fans had to go home.
The Senators landed on the offerings of
James, the deep sea monster, in the third
for two hits and a run. The home
team tied up this In their half
of the same round when Eagan
erred and Townsend made a stupid
play by throwing Lynch's bunt to third
when there was no chance to head off the
runner.
In the fourth spasm Sheehan and Doyle
both hit safely and were advanced on an
out by Graham. Then just to show he
was there with the stick as well as the
wing, old Phil soused out a hit to right
field and brought them both in.
Irwln's error and an out gave the Sen
ators one* more In the ninth. This lone
tally proved the winning run, for had it
not been scored Lynch's drive would then
have tied the result up. The score:
'Twas Just like a peep Into the dim
past to see the venerable Phil Knell, once
the pride of "Plttsburg, mount the mound
yesterday at Recreation Park. A mlg-hty
ch*er went up as soon as the fans spotted
the man who used to electrify many of
them in days gone by. The old man did
his work wellâ so well that the home
toam succumbed' by a score of 4 to 3.
He looked likÂ« the same Phil who was
a twinkling star when most of the pres
ent performers of this league were view
ing: bull games through knotholes or' else
were being- wheeled around in-baby car
riages. With all the years his* good left
arm has not lost any of its cleverness,
though his wonderful speed seema to have
forsaken him.

STANDING OF THE CLUB3.
The cups were won by R. N. Whitney
and Jules Brady on the last occasion.
x ney have been won also by Routh and
Dunlap. Clinch and McKay, the Hotch
kiss brothers twice and Allen and Smith.
Tho'HotchKiss brothers will not play in
future. Smith and Allen, the most heav
ily -handicapped team, did not enter.
The teams playing from scratch are
Routh and Dunlap and the Baker broth
ers. This will be the first appearance of
the latter as a doubles team on the pub
lic courts. They made a good record at
the University of California and are con
sidered to have the best chance of win
ning. Their game is better suited to han
dicap conditions than is that of Routh
and Dunlap.
Next to these" two teams probably the
strongest players are Russell and Janes,
who receive "2-6." They have never
playe.l together, but are good individual
players. Foley and Lewis, on the "2-6"
mark, stand a good chance.
In the women's event play will com
mence to-morrow morning at . 9 o'clock.
The men's tourney will commence at the
same hour on Sunday.

GRAVESEXD RACE^TRACK. X. Y.,
S^pt. 17.â The racing at Gravecend to-day
wÂ«s over a very plushy track and conse
â¢ .Â¦jcnTly horses noted for their ability to
i vn under such circumstances finished
tint v.ith great rÂ«^u!arity. . The most
: â¢â¢table performances were those shown
by Shotgun and Aristocracy in their re-
M-.ectlve races. Both were required to
Â¦ ;<rry top weights and buth were forced
;.i <1o their bÂ«st to win.
Shotgun was vigorously handled by his
rider. Hicks, all through the last fur-
Uir.g. He stood off the rush of Wild
Thyme, which, better placed at the start,
might have made it Impossible for Shot
ttun to win. John W. Gates is reported
to have wagered J&000 on Shotgun.
Aristocracy's chief opposition in the fifth
race came from the long shot. Ruby Ring.
h was not until the last half-furlong of
th*Â» race that Ruby Ring showed indica
tions of having enough and even then
Hi:Â£gi&h. hard-ridden Mollnos got second
money by only a head from the well
l-pcked Covlngton filly.
The Speculation stakes was won by
Pui^y Green, which defeated Rostand by
i'!i( and a half lengths, with Thorney

CHICAGO, Sept. 17.â Only three of the
six starters finished in the Emerald
steeplechase over the short course, which
was the feature of the Hawthorne card
to-day. Handvice, at 7 to 2, proved the
easiest kind of a winner, pulled to a walk,
with *ix lengths to spare over Falella.
The three which met with mishaps were
Slap Dash and Moranda, both of which
fell, and Joe McCJee, which broke down
badly and was pulled up. In the fall of
S!ap Dash Jockt-y Morrison was serious
ly Injured.
Judge Himes. which probably has no
equal in the West as a mud runner,
picked up 114 pounds in the fourth race
tnd made a show of his field, winning by
three lengths in a common gallop.
The track was deep and holding; the
weather cloudy and disagreeable, ma

THE ENGLISH PHYSIQUE
SAID TO BE INCREASING
Betterment Not Confined to the Well
to-Do, but Generally Ob
servable, t
TherÂ« Is. wp believe. Home exaggeration
In the widespread Idea that the physique
of our population Is declining. All through
history, every successive generation has
indulged in that fancy, and of all gen
erations this is the one that loves most
to hunt out and dlspla'y evils to be rem
edied. People forget that every popula
tion on earth, deposits a sediment, a pro
portion of weaklings. Imbeciles and un
dersized folk, which Is fixed by some law
of. which we know nothing, and which
increases rather than diminishes as so
cial safety Improves, as sanitary science
advances and as pity for the weak be
comes a more active virtue. The rickety,
who once died like files, now tend to re
main alive. With the enormous Increase
of our population the positive number
of such persons becomes more and more
visible, till observers fancy that some evil
change must have passed over the pop
ulation. They see the hundred loafers in
the street, and forget the thousand toil
ers In the factory. The improvement in
the physique of the well-to-do also, which
Is so great that the majority cannot put
on ancient armor, and which reaches so
far down that, as the Bishop of Rlpon
pointed out in ti.e Lords recently, the
average heicht of Englishmen has in
creased by three-quarters of an inch in
thirty years, accentuates the apparent de
fects of the weakly, just as the multitude
of tall girls now seen In a ballroom ac
centuates the lowliness of the short.
There Is a disposition, too, among the
cultivated, which does not. we fancy, ex
ist among those who work, to make too
much of mere bulk. They forget that
the Chinese are among the strongest of
mankind, and disbelieve when told that
the Roman soldiery were, as a rule, little
men, perhaps three Inches shorter than
the Gauls they conquered. Again, we
dare assert that a regiment of London
costermongers would, unarmed, probably
defeat an unarmed regiment of Bis
marck's Pomeranians and overthrow with
their hands a regiment of Sikhs, with
their remarkable average of height. We
have on this subject, as on most others,
to rid ourselves of some prejudices be
fore we can arrive at the facts, and to
recognize that in muscle, as in less meas
urable things, quantity and ' quality are
not necessarily Identical.â London Gazette.
QUIT WHINING
AND GO TO WORK
A Plea for the Cheerful Soul
Who Lives to Be
Happy.
There isn't anything in the world more
disagreeable than a whining person. He
whines If It is hot. HÂ« whines if It is
cold. He whines at this, he whines at
that, he whines at everything. Whine,
whine, whine. It is Just a habit he has
fallen into. There is nothing the matter
with him. It Is Just a bad habit.
The whlner Is generally an idle person
or a lazy one. What he needs la to be
st to work-at real hard work, mental or
physical. Some work that will interest
him and engage his whole attention and
he will not have time to whine. We know
two women. One of them does her own
housework and takes care of her horse
besides. She Is happy and singing all the
day long. The keyboard of her life
sounds no whining note. It is a pleasure
to be with her. a good, wholesome tonic
to watch her. The other woman Is so sit
uated that she does not have to work.
Nothing to do but to amuse herself. She
has no zest In Jlfe. no interest In any
thing. She Is a bunch of selfishness and
whines at everything. Whining has be
come such a habit with her that her
most casual remark Is tinged with a
whine. She Is miserable herself and makes
everybody else in her presence miserable
She is a weakling, a parasite, a drag, a
heavy weight' on somebody all the time.
Get the whine out of your voice or it
will stop the development and growth of
your body. It will narrow and shrink
your mind. It will drive away your
friends: it will make you unpopular. Quit
your whining; brace up; go to work; be
something; stand for something; fill your
place In the universe. Instead of whining
around, exciting only pity and contempt
face about and make something of your
self. Reach up to the stature of a strong
ennobling manhood, to the beauty and
strength of a superb womanhood.
There Is nothing the matter with you
Just quit your whining and go to work â
Medical Talk.
Webster's Opinion of Himself.
A lady of one of the old families living

by artificial inoculation. The farmers of
Coutra 'Costa County have lately discov
ered that the squirrels have been dying
off from some new disease that has at
tacked them. But these pests have not
been dying fast enough to please the
farmers, who think they have found a
way to assist the disease. Some . bright
mind among them suggested that the mal
ady might be spread by capturing a few
of the diseased ones, extracting the
plague germs and then inoculating hun
dreds of other animals, which would then
Infect those among which they are turned
loose. The plan seems to be a perfectly
feasible one and It may solve the prob

George Jones, who for twenty years has

is 93 years of age. The grip has fastened
its fatal hold on the aged prisoner and
his death is expected any day. While
paralysis has so far disabled him as to
have kept him bedridden all these years.
it has seemingly never impaired his vital

boasting that he would live to be 100.
Jones has lain in a darkened cell until
his hair, beard and skin are snow white,
and the semi-darkness has so affected his
eyesight tfcat the small electric bulb in
his cell has to be heavily shaded for him
to be able to endure it when lighted. For

ishment. Until recently they shone like

mortgage on furniture sold by him to
Mrs. A. Shaffer Is on trial. The court
suggested yesterday that a warrant for

obtained by Mrs. Shaffer. It seems that
Evans' wife purchased a lot of furniture
from a Market-street dealer and then bor
rowed money on it. giving a mortgage as
security. She then gave her husband a
bill of sale for the articles and he sold
the goods to Mrs. Shaffer. These facts
were elicited during the trial of the suit
to foreclose the mortgage brought by the
money lender. Pending the trial Charles
Corey is acting as receiver, but Mrs.
Shaffer refuses to turn the goods over to
him and her refusal brought about the
suggestion that Evans should have

This action by the police results from
several conferences held by them with
District Attorney Allen since the Wal
kirez trial. Hope fcr a conviction of the
woman rests upon the testimony that was
brought out during the trial. The police
think there is sufficient evidence to con
nect the Rcss woman strongly enough
with the foul crime to warrant her con
viction as an accessory.
It has been a theory of the police since
the crime was uncovered that the woman
was in large measure morally respon
sible for the murder. This idea held with
the officers, despite the fact that she re
vealed the story and-tdok the detectives
to the spot in the Leroy cottage at Golden
Gate where, the old woman lay buried In
the grave that Walkirez had dug.
The woman's term for vagrancy will
have been completed in November. After
that the murder case will be heard.

Gambling and fondness for the race
track on the part of the wife has wrecked
the home of F. J. Meckfessel, cashier of
the Del Monte Milling Company, and to
day he was granted a divorce froni Mary
E. Meckfessel by Judge Melvin on the
ground of extreme crueltyr- Mrs. Meck
fessel made no appearance and did not
answer the charges against her. It was
claimed that she had been completely won
over by the passion for gambling, and
forsook the society of her husband for
that of touts who could give her tips.
The Meckfessels were married in 1S31,
and until two years ago harmuny reigned
in their home. But a day at the track
and a fever for gambling took such a
hold on the woman that Meckfessel stated
to the court that she finally gave up her
household duties altogether and squan
dered his money trying to pick winners.
Among her acquaintances at the race
track was one Swalley, who it is alleged
gave Mrs. Meckfessel passes to the tracks
and tips on the races. The plaintiff states
that she was constantly in Swalley's so
ciety, and he finally forbade her to have
anything more to do with him. This was
ignored by both of them, causing him
much mental anguish, and he was then
forced to begin action for divorce against
her.

The witnesses examined yesterday were
Corporal George W. Russell, who made a
diagram of the scene of the shooting; Dr.
L. D. Baclgalupl, the autopsy surgeon at
the Morgue; Frank W. Farley, who was
In the saloon at the time of the shooting,
and Mrs. Henrloulle, the saloon-keeper.
Two of the witnesses, Murdoch McDonald
and John McCann, failed to answer to
their names, and bench warrants were
issued for their arrest. The case will be
continued this morning.
A jury was impaneled in Judge Cook's
court yesterday to try the case of Wil
liam T. Rudolph, charged with the mur
der of Walter Edgerton in Mrs. Elizabeth
Henrioulle's saloon, 135 Second street, on
the afternoon of February 11.
Rudolph is a son-in-law of the notorious
"Mother" Keyeu, and it was said he had
a grudge against Edgerton for striking
his mother-in-law last November during
a dispute about the possession of Edger
ton's clothes. Edgerton had served a
term in San Quentln.
The two met on Second street, near Na
toma, on February 11, and Rudolph claims
that Edgerton cut him twice with a knife.
Rudolpl? pulled a revolver out of_ hi3
pocket and Edgerton ran into Mrs. Hen
rioulle's saloon, followed by Rudolph.
gerton took refuge behind some barrels,
but Rudolph saw him, and Edgerton
threw up his hands, saying, "Don't shoot;
you see I have .nothing." Rudolph delib
erately shot him dead.
Rudolph was arrested later in his moth
er-in-law's residence, 28 Minna street, by
Policemen Tyrrell and Wlnzler and of
fered a' stout resistance. The police claim
that Rudolph cut himself in his mother-
Jn-law's residence to prepare for a plea
of self-defense.

CHICAGO. SÂ«pt. 17.â Better weather condi
tions and the growing belief that neither quan
tities nor qualities of the wheat yield has
suffered appreciable loss, with lower cables
and weakness in corn, caused a weak opening
in wheat. December showing a loss of %(Â§; 1 .4c
at Sl&@$2Â»4c. On top of these Influences
came another bad break in September wheat
at Minneapolis and there was a rush of sell
ing orders that forced December back to 81%o
before the decline was checked and some re
covery scored by influential buying brought
about by a roport of a big export business In
flour and increased demand. The close was
steady, with December off- %c at S1Â£081K&
. Crop damage reports from the country were
few and the corn market opened under heavy
selling pressure. There was a ehow of
strength in the closing hour on the -prospect
that frost- danger is still imminent. Decem
ber closed steady at 52%c. a loss cf ?4@%c.
Oats were lower early but the late tone was
strong and the cash demand was good. De
cember closed higher at 3STÂ£@33c.
PacklTHMiouse demand turned a v.eak pro
vision market.'to firm, and some early loss in
prices was recovered. October pork closed 15c
lower,- lard down 10c. and ribs 2>Ac lower.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
It has transpired that the name of the
man who attempted to take his own life
by Inhaling gas at 204 Ellis street last
Wednesday' is W. A. Scaular and not
"Scanlon." as was written by him in a
note to Edward "Ward, a Chinatown
guide. Scaular is a remittance man and
comes from Australia. On July 10 last
he Is alleged to have shot an inoffensive
Japanese window cleaner in a saloon on
Steiner street. He was out on a cash
bond of $150 given by Attorney Archie
Campbell, who surrendered him to the po
lice on learning of his attempted suicide.
Surrenders Client to Police.
The offices of the plant are at 83 Fre
mont street, where it was stated that the
works were valued y at $75,000, on which
there was an insurance of about $35,000.
The building in which the plant was lo
cated was owned by Miss Jennie Flood.
Firo which was discovered at 6 c^clock
yesterday morning destroyed the
Francis Smith & Co. steel works,
on Tpwnsend street, between Seventh and
Eighth streets, entailing a v loss of about
$75,000. The blaze started in the engine
room from some unknown cause and was
discovered by a night watchman after it
had attained a good start. By the time
the fire apparatus arrived the entire plant
was a mass of flames, and the main work
of the firemen was directed to saving ad
joining property.
The hay barns of McNab & Smith,
across the alley from the conflagration,
were seriously threatened, and it required
the utmost efforts of the fire department
to keep them and their contents from go
ing up in smoke. The pipes were massed
to the north of the blazing- structure and
a deluge of water was poured in to check
the flames. The firemen were compelled
to labor in almost unbearable heat for
two hours, playing streams on the fire at
every point where it threatened to spread
to the hay barns. Finally the fire burned
itself out, having consumed everything
inflammable in the steel works.
The destroyed structure was a quarter
of a block wide and half a block deep and
was filled with costly machinery. It is
not believed that any of it can be used
again in making steel plate. Sixty men
who have been employed at the plant are
forced out of work until such time as the
owners rebuild. Construction on the new
plant will be commenced as soon as the
losses are adjusted with the insurance
companies.

The court did. not touch the question of
the validity of the trust clause in the will.
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that the executors of the will of Amasa
P. Willey erred in making a partial dis
tribution of the estate before they re
ceived legal authority to do so. Willey
stipulated In his will that certain sums
should be paid to the various heirs at
stated periods. The executors made some
of these payments, to the amount of $1673,
and combined these items with uncontest
ed expenditures, requesting that they be
given credit for the full amount.
T. J. Lyons, and Louisa Muirhead, as
executor and executrix, respectively, of
the estate of one of the heirs, objected to
the partial distribution and were sus
tained by the Superior Court. Appeal was
made to the higher tribunal and the de
cision of the lower coÂ»rt was affirmed.
This means that, the executors will have
to stand the loss of $1675.

and faced the furnace on the ferryboat.
The boat left Tiburon short-handed, but
made the run on time. The Tiburon

The members of the Tiburon branch No.

with the executive committee, composed
of O. G. Brockmlller, H. Hackett, H.

were present. A committee was appcJnt

this afternoon about twenty laborers
working in the coal bunkers were Induced
to quit. Six carpenters In the shops re
mained at work all day under the protec

To-night everything is quiet. The union

Sheriff Taylor and six deputies arrived
on the scene at 11 o'clock and together
with the company's detectives patrolled
the wharf, car shops and other property
belonging to the road. There was no at
tempt on the Dart of any union man to
commit violence and none was boisterous.
Yesterday the boats and trains of the
California Northwestern Railroad were
running as usual and it was announced
by the company's officials that they feared
no further interruption. .
"Mr. J. K. Brassll. Master Mechanic â Dear
Sir: We have information to the effect that
you have recently discriminated against one
of the employes In your department, Mr. A.
D. McDonald, because of his membership In

the policy of this company. Its assurances to
Us employes have been such that we cannot
approve of your course in this connection.
"We direct that you win not again allow
yourself to be Influenced by any such consid
â¢ eratlons. However. Inasmuch as Mr. McDon
ald. Instead of reporting his grievances to the
proper official of the company, has seen fit to
Ignore the proper channel of communication;
but. on the contrary, has sought redrcs by

him of the attitude of the company, and that
the discharge is In no way due to his mem
bership in any union. Tours truly.

It will thus appear that the company has
kept Its assurance to its employes, that no em
ploye would be discriminated against on ac
count of membership in a union. Upon the
discharge of said employe he again failed to
make appeal to the company, but sought re
dress through people ; who . were not in the
employ of the company. Under these circum
stances the Â¦ company, pursuant to lta policy,
declined to entertain an appeal. By the cir

employes, including one. discharged, we had
invited all employes who had grievances to

follow the consistent policy Â¦ of .the company
to take its employes into Its confidence and

Becoming alarmed Miss Jones coughed
and the conversation was abruptly ended.
Shortly afterward the men engaged a

passing the door leading to their room he
was surprised to hear the clicking of a
pistol. The police were immediately noti

Curtis called attention to the fact that
there are twenty-one tracks crossing
Fourth street at Townsend, and yet heavy
teams are passing thereon constantly
every day. He said the overhead bridges
Charles Wesley Reed, representing prop
erty owners who protested against too
many tracks crossing Sixteenth street,
called attention to the fact that under
the terms rf the proposed franchise the
company would be enabled to have twenty
tracks crossing Sixteenth street between
Pennsylvania avenue and Kentucky
street, although it appeared to be the
manifest intention of the board under the
original ordinance to limit the number of
tracks to twelve. Reed said that other
sections of the ordinance and other or
dinances heretofore passed already pro
vided for eight tracks on Sixteenth street,
in addition to the twelve tracks specifical
ly allowed In the new franchise.
"I desire to call attention also to the
fact that when the streets in the vicinity
of Sixteenth were closed in 18D2 the city
did not waive any of its vested rights in
them," said Reed. "Yet in this franchise
it is proposed to give the Southern Pa
cific Company absolute control of these
streets for the next fifty years."
"The company agrees to be limited U
fiix tracks in addition to those alread5
provided for," said Supervisor Curtis.
"Well, if willing to cut it down to six,
why could the company not be cut down
to two?" asked Reed. "The point that I
wish to impress on this board is that
there is no other way to get to the water
front except by Sixteenth street. Is it
not right and fair that an open highway
favoring team traffic should be provided

Section 6. The said company shall, at any
tiin* when required by resolution of the Board

fc- designated by said Board of Supervisors,
and taid company shall not allow any car or
locomotive to stand upon any street or street
crossing on or over which a franchise is grant
ca by the provisions of this ordinance at any
tirje day or nisrht. and that no freight shall

the express understanding that this franchise

and across paid streets to reach certain points,
and the right to use the streets or any portion
thereof for yard purposes Is absolutely pro
hibited.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday by
a unanimous vote passed to print the or
dinance providing- for a grant of franchise
for a period of fifty years to the Southern
Pacific Company for its bay shore line.
The original ordinance was amended so
That the company shall be limited to the
laying of six tracks across Sixteenth
street. As the company has already the
privilege to maintain eight tracks it will
have fourteen in all. '
The franchise carries with it the widen
ing of Sixteenth street by ten feet, and
the board also referred to the Board of
Works at Supervisor Brandenstein's sug
gestion the doing away with the sidewalks
on both sides of Sixteenth street, between
Seventh and Kentucky, thus further wid
ening the street by thirty feet additional.
An additional amendment was also in
corporated in the ordinance as follows:

The highwayman did not point the
weapon at Nolen, but simply said, "I
am sorry, my friend, but I am afraid
that I will have to trouble you for some
money. I have just enough to take me
over to Oakland, but I need some more,
so you will oblige me greatly if you will
hand over your coin."
Nolen by this time had recovered his
self-possession and he informed the high
wayman that he had only 10 cents In his
pocket, Just enough to take him home.
The robber did not believe this and be
gan to argue, when suddenly a man was
seen comlne: down the road.
Then, according to Nolen's statement,
the robber said, "Well, I guess I will
have to bid you good-night." With that
he turned and ran In the opposite direc
tion and disappeared in the darkness.
Nolen does not know who the other man
was, but thinks he was one of the em
ployes at the life saving station.
Nolen then proceeded on his way to
ward the Beach Tavern, but before he
had gone a hundred feet he met a woman
and a little girl. The woman appeared
to be greatly excited and she ran up to
Nolen, saying, "Don't go this way. I have
just been held up. I did not have any
money, but the highwayman frightened"
me awfully."
Nolen says that he continued on his
way and that the woman and little girl
went in the opposite direction. He says
that he did not ask the woman her name
and the police authorities have not heard
from hÂ«r.
Nolen went to the park station and re
ported the hold-up there. Officers Rey
nolds and Bonner were detailed on the
case, but they were unable to find any
clew that might, lead to the Identity of
the highwayman.
The bold highwayman who has been
operating in various sections of the city
for several weeks was heard from again
last night. He held up a man and a wom
an in close succession near the automobile
road on the park boulevard, but for the
first time since he began to ply his tradÂ©
he received nothing for his pains.
Shortly after S o'clock W. O. Nolen, a
waiter residing at 127 Hyde street, was
walking along the boulevard with his
6-year-old boy. As he neared the automo
bile road he was startled to see a man
spring out of the brush by the roadside
and advance to within a few feet of him,
pistol in hand.

Yesterday General Manager Whiting is
sued the following circular, which clear

company is concerned, and especially as
to relations with its employes:
September 17. 1903.
"We will not recede a step from our posi
tion. While I am willing to admit that the
strike has caused some inconvenience, it will
not materially affect the operation of trains
and boats, which are running aa usual. Our
shops may have to be closed for some time,
but our stock Is in pretty good shape, and if
the public Is satisfied to travel in a car that
needs a little new paint or a few other re
pairs, we will not suffer any interruptiÂ«i In
our traffic arrangements.
FOSTER WILL NOT RECEDE.
Our company long ago took the stand that
it Is none of its affair if its employes become
members of unions or other organizations, but
it refuses to recognize the latter in matters
pertaining to the management of the road or
the conduct of the employes. When a man
has a grievance we regard It as a matter that
can be readily settled between the individual
and the executive officers of the road. Had
McDonald carried his case to this office it prob
ably would have been settled in a manner eat
lsfactory to himself, for as I have specifically
set forth in a letter to Master Mechanic Bras
sll. who acted in an Indiscreet way, he had
no right to discriminate against a man be
cause he happened to belong to a union. In
stead of presenting his troubles to the offi
cials of the company McDonald carried them
to an organization entirely foreign to the roatl.
That reason, and only that reason, waa re
sponsible for the order of his discharge issued
by me. . . .
The strike followed. The brotherhood
in explaining its ground for yesterday's
walkout sets forth that recently one of
JtB members, A. D. McDonald, a night
watchman employed at the company's
yards at Tiburon, was promised promo
tion to a position of fireman on the
steamer James M. Donahue by Master
Mechanic Brazil, and from the latter
he received a letter recommendlne him
for the place. Noting that McDonald
wore a badge of the brotherhood. It is
charged that Brassll withdrew his let
ter, remarking that he would not recom
mend for promotion a man who belonged
to the organization. McDonald reported
the matter to the officers of the rgani
zatlon, who proceeded to take the ques
tion up to General Manager Whiting, and
this move was followed by the discharge
of McDonald. Efforts to have the watch
man reinstated failed and a strike was
decided on. In reviewing the situation
yesterday President Foster said that It
was true that Brassil had revoked his
letter of recommendation because he had
discovered that McDonald was a member
of the brotherhood, but the master me
chanic had acted without- authorization
from the officials of the road.
MASTER, MECHANIC REBUKED.
When President Foster learned of the
action of his master mechanic he prompt
ly rebuked that official in a letter In
which, however, he ordered the discharge
of McDonald because the latter had in
voked the aid of outside Influences in
an effort to regain his position Instead
of bringing his grievance before the prop
er officials of the road. Continuing the
discussion of the affair. President Foster
said:
GROWS OUT OF DISMISSAL.
A long expected strike on the California
Northwestern Railway was Inaugurated
yesterday, morning, , when about 150 men
employed in the company's paint and car
penter shops at Tiburon and as deck
hands and freight handlers walked out.
When the steamer Tiburon reached her
berth on this side of the bay at 9:30
In the morning the deckhands went ashore
and simultaneously the freight handlers
abandoned their trucks and the men in
trie shops across the bay quit work. Hav
ing prepared themselves for an emer
gency, the officials of the road soon had
another crew aboard the Tiburon and
traffic was resumed after a short delay.
The shops, however, may be closed for
some time, for the company admits that
it has made no attempt to replace the
men who have walked out and may not
do so for a time at least.
The trouble is the result of the refusal
of President A. W. Foster and General
Manager H. C. Whiting to recognize the
United Brotherhood of Railroad Em
ployes' demand for the reinstatement of
one of its members who .was recently
discharged. Wednesday a committee from
the organization waited on President
Foster and formally demanded that the
discharged man be placed back in his
old position at once. The meeting failed
in Its purposes in so far as the United
Brotherhood of Railroad Employes was
concerned, for, following a policy adopted,
by the company some . time ago to the
effect that It would not recognize any
labor organization in matters bearing
upon the relations between Itself and its
employes President Foster refused to
treat withv the committee and consequent
ly denied its members an answer to its
demands.
On recommendation of the Street Com
mittee, Supervisor Connor Introduced the
proposed ordinance providing for a grant
of franchise to the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railway Company for a right of
way and the right to construct and ope
rate a steam railroad from a point on In
diana street, near Eighteenth, thence
along Mariposa, Seventh, Sixteenth,
Eighth and Fifteenth streets. The bill
was Introduced at the request oÂ£ the rail
road company in order that the expira
tion of the period of ninety days required
by the charter before any franchise may

administration of the present board. The
bill was then referred to the Street Com
mittee for further investigation.
A petition signed by the Moody Estate
Company, Abner Doble Company, J. B.
Coryell and the Standard Oil Company
was filed, asking that the application of
th<? Santa Fe Company be granted. |
The board N directed the Public Utilities
Committee to secure estimates of the
working expenses, interest and other ex
penses in the operation of the Geary
street road by the municipality and the
probable income to be derived from this
road, and to take such testimony as may
be necessary for the purpose.
SANTA FE FRANCHISE.
"I would suggest that the company in
crossing Sixteenth street use the 'grooved*
rail," said Renner.
Chief Engineer Hood of the Southern
Pacific Company agreed to put any rail
down on the street which the board
deemed to be the best for the purpose.
Renner favored the widening of Six
teenth street. Reed said his client wanted
the street widened by twenty feet, but
the company would widen it by ten feet
only.
At this point Burke stated that he was
authorized to announce that the Southern
Pacific Company would pay all claims for
damages resulting from changes of grades
along the route of the bay shore line upon
the final passage of the ordinance. The
damages will be assessed by City Engi
neer Grunsky. The ordinance will be
finally passed on December 21, 1903, un
der charter requirements.
George Renner, manager of the Dray
men's Association, argued that the ob
structions would be less with fourteen
tracks than with six, if the company
would agree to keep the roadway in good
condition.
"We have one double track crossing
Sixteenth street," said Burke, "and we
must Insist on twelve more tracks In or
der to handle our business. Two tracks
less will make our franchise valueless in
view of the concessions we have already
made. Ten tracks would result in more
obstructions by passing trains than
twelve tracks. The main track will cause
but little obstruction to teaming."
Reed asked that the company be limited
to twelve tracks in all on Sixteenth street
from Pennsylvania avenue to the waters
of the bay, exclusive of the tracks of the
Santa Fe system, of which the Southern
Pacific Company will have the joint use.
"We ask for twelve tracks in addition
to two already laid along Seventh street,
which will make fourteen tracks in all
crossing Sixteenth street," said Jere
Burke, for the Southern Pacific Company.
Reed persisted in his demand that the
tracks . be limited to twelve, but Burke
said the company had made all the con
cessions It could In the matter.

Deputy Gamble was in the office dur
ing a good part of the day and left the
Appraiser's building alone at 4:20 p. m.
Ever since The Call published that he had
made confession he has refused to answer
any Questions. His friends, of whom he
has many, still stand by him and will
back him to the end, notwithstanding
that he has yielded to temptation. He
can be indicted for no offense greater
than a misdemeanor, the maximum pun
ishment for which is one year's impris
onment in the County Jail or a fine.
The Federal Grand Jury will meet on
Tuesday and Friday of next week and
the case may be presented to them at
either session.

Woodworth denies the report that Deputy
