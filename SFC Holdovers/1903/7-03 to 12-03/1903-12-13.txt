was three-fourths made up of Tory mili

You will conceive that I was "overjoyed

in anticipation I saw the tide-turning

cautions against hallooing before you are
out of the wood. Captain de Peyster
was come, and Tybee and I were taking
our leave of the major, when there was
a sudden -commotion among the guards
without, and a little man in black, his
wig awry and his clothing, torn by the
rough man-handling of the sentries, burst
into the tent.
"Seize him! Seize him! He is a rebel
spy!" he shrieked, pointing at me.
As you would guess, all talk paused at
this dramatic Interruption, and all eye3
were turned upon me. Had the littla
viper been content to rest his charge up
on the simple accusation, I know not
what mlcht have happened. But when
he got hia breath he burst out in a tirade
of the foulest abuse, cursing me up one
side and down the other, and enftns in
a gibbering fit of rage that left him pal
lid and f oamlns at the lipsâ and gave me
my cue. "
â¢"Tis the little madman of Queens
borough," I said, coolly, explaining to
the bluff major. "His mania takes the
form of a curious hatred for me, though
I loiow not why. Two days since, he was
put in arrest by my lord's authority for
threatening my life and that of his mas
ters daughter. Now, it would seem, he
, has broken jail - and followed ; me hither."
I clicked my heels, saluted, and gave
him the express from my lord â the right
one. this time. He tore off the wrapping,
swore a hearty soldier oath when he read
the fore part of the letter and clapped
his leg. joyfully, like the brave gentleman
that he was. when he came to the post
criptum.
"Ye're a fine fellow, captain: ye've
brought me good news," he said; then
he bade an aide call Captain de Peyster.
his second in command, and in the same
breath gave Tybee and me in charge to
an ensign for our billeting- for, , the night.
"Damme! see now what you've done;
you've fspllt my breech-charger all about
the place!" rasped the major, when all
was over. And then: "Who the devil are
ye, anyway: and what do ye want wl'
me?"
In any crisis less tremendous I should
have roared a-laughing to see the dough
ty major and my good friend the lieu
tenant vie with each' other in their skip
pings to escape the unseen enemy. But
It was no, laughing moment for me. At
a 'flash my sword was out and I was
hacking hither and yon at the imagin
ary foe. In the hurly-burly I contrived
to sprawl all across the work-bench
table, and the packet. which would have
killed my plot â and, belike, the plotter
as wellâ was reared and quickly jagged
Into hiding. ;
"The end is not yet. my good friend;
and I may not come off better than the
others," I rejoined. And with that we
fared on again till we .. could see â¢ the
campfires of "Ferguson's little army
twinkling between the tree trunks.
We pressed forward in silence through
the shadowy labyrinth of the wood for a
time, but at the crossing of a small run
let vrhere we would stop to let the horses
drink. Tybee burst out a-laughing. *<
..J," Tis as sood as a play," he said.
Three several times I've had to change
my mind about you, Captain 7 Ireton, and
I'm not cock-sure I have your measure
yet. But I'll say this: if you've strung
my lord successfully, you'll be the first
to do it and come off alive in the end."
He looked a little rueful, as a good
soldier would, but was disposed to make
the best of a bad bargain.
"Here's my hand on it," he said; and a
little later we had dragged the two
troopers to the cabin, where the old man
became surety for their safe keeping,
and' were feeling our way cautiously
westward at the heels of the Catawba,
who had taken his directions from our
patriarch.
"But you are." I rejoined, rather
shamefacedly, yet thankful to the finger
tips that I had not consented to a mas
sacre. "I am for the Congresi and the
Commonwealth, lieutenant, and you are
my prisoner. May I trouble you for tho
dispatcher? you carry?"
He looked up at me with a. queer gri
mace on his boyish face.
"The Â¦â¢ devil! but you're a cool hand,
Captain Ireton! Whatever you were in
that coll at Appleby, you've led the spy's*
long suit thi.s time. And I'm not sure
whether I like you any-the worse for it,
if so be you must be a rebel." And with
that, he' gave me the sealed packet and
asked me what I would do with hfm.
His query set me thinking. As for tho
two stunned tropers, l meant to turn
them over to the old man for safe keep-
Ing;- but I was loth to make it harder
than need ba .for this good-natured
youngster. So I put him upon his honor.
"Do you know what this packet con
tains?" I astted. .
He laughed. "My lord did not honor
me with his confidence. I was to follow
you in to Major Ferguson's camp, deliver
the dispatches and vanish."
VGood; then you need tell no lies..
When the Indian has fetched my horse,
I shall ride to Ferguson's camp, and you
may ride with me. I shall ask no more
than this: that .you do not fight again
till you are exchanged: and that you will
not tell Major Ferguson whose prisoner
you are. Do you accept the terms?"
"Gad! I'd be a fool not to. But what's
in the wind, captain? Surely you can
tell me, now that I am safely out of the
running.
"You will know in a day or two; and
in the meantime Ignorance is your best
safety.' You can tell Major. Ferguson
that you were waylaid on the road by a
party of the enemy, and that you were
paroled and fell in with me."
"Gad! my captain." he said, feeling his
throat. "If you have a grip like that for
your*friends, I'm damned glad I'm not
your enemy."
"Enough, man! 'tis as good'- as a
feast!" he cried, when I had him fast
pinioned; and thereupon I let him have
breath and freedom to sit up. In the
act he had his first good sight of me,, as
I had mine of him. jj Twas Tybee and no
other. i',\i; .'. ' . .
Lacking the Catawba to guide us, I
doubt if either the old man or I could
have found my rear-guard's bivouac near
the trail I had left. But Uncanoola led'
us straight through the pitchy darkness;
and when' we were come upon the three
soldiers we found them all asleep around
the handful of 'campnre.
'Twould have been murder outright to
kill them thus, and now I. thinkthe old
patriarch forgot his wrongs' and was as
merciful as I. ' But not so the Catawba."
He had armed, himself with a stout' war
club, and before I was free to stop him

I roÂ«e. turning iny back upon the chlm
new corner and its holdings with a sigh.
For now the time was come for action,
and I must needs be a man o* blood and
iron again.
The old man sanded the wet ," pen
ctiokes and bade me say if it would
serve, 'Twas a most beautiful forgery.
My lord's crabbed handwriting. was cop

"CORNWALLIS."

How to rhanpe such an order to re
verse its effect. I knew no more than a
yokel; but here again my ancient ally
showed himself to be a man of parts.
Dressing thÂ«> pen to make it 4 the fellow

scanned tho handwriting of the letter
closely, made a few practice pothooks to

lord accepted it and made me his dis
patch bearer because he thought I knew
the way to Ferguson when no one else
know it. Eut enough of this; time
presses. Let me have ink and the quill."
The old man led the way into the cabin
and put his writing tools at my disposal.
Left to myself. I should have broken the
meal of the packet, but my wise old ally,
cool and collected now. showed me how
to eplit the paper beneath ths wax.
Opened and ppread before us on the rude
Blab table, the letter proved to be the
briefest of military commands: a per
emptory order to Ferguson to rejoin the
rziixln body at once, proceeding by forced
marches If needful, and on no account to
risk engagement with the over-mountain
men.
He looked M rae narrowly. "Ferguson
left Gilbert Town some days since. Ir

out of your way: if 'tis the manâ . '

"Ai:d what may your errand be? aiay

-It is to brii.g him to a standstill the

The old rr.an trembled with excite

cried "But 'tis too late now. Listen:
his present camp is bat three miles to

there no longer ago than the Wednesday.
I I made niy submission to him â curse
himâ bo that I might mayhap learn of
his plans. He told me all; how that now
he was safe; that the mountaineers were
gone off from the fording of the Broad
on a false scent; that Tarleton with four
hundred of the legion would soon be
marching to his relief.
"I stole away when I could, and that
night took horse and rode twenty miles

"should have gone myself, but â "
"Stay, my good friend," said I; "you
go toofast for me. If Ferguson is still
out of communication with the main at
Charlotte we may halt him yet."
The old man made a gesture of impa
tience.
"'Tis a thing done because it is as
good as done. The major will break
camp and march to-morrow morning, and
he can reach Charlotte at ease in two
<iays. What with their losing of his

"None the less, we shall halt him."

"You? â a bearer of Lord Cornwallis*

length between us and held the little one

comforted.

"Enough, sir," I said, when I could
trust myself to cj>eak. "This same King
George's minions have made me a home
less outcast, too. I live but to give some
counter stroke, if I may."
He stopped and choked; and the child
looked up Into my face with her blue
eyes full of nameless terror. "Oh, I
want my mammy!" she cried. "Won't
you find her for me. Captain Jack?"
I slipped from the saddle, still clasping
the little cne tightly in my arms.
He came a step nearer and faced me
boldly. "Listen, sir: Two of my sons
were left on the bloody field of Camden,
and the butcher Banastre Tarleton slew
the other two et Fishing Creek. A
month since a band of roving savages,
armed with King George's muskets, mind

n / IS eyes flashed and he drew him
1 \ self up proudly.
I I "The ICIng has taken all. sir, as
X J you see," this with a wave of the
%y hand to point me to the forlorn
homestead. "There is naught left me
save this poor hut and my little maid."
This man gave his testimony briefly,
tellins.but the bare truth. A week ear
lier I had passed in Davie's camp
for a true blue patriot, this though
J was wearing a ragged Brit
ish uniform at the moment. As
.for the witness himself, he had mis
doubted me all along, but the colonel
had trusted me and had sent me on
some secret mission, the; Inwardness of
which he. John Whittlesey, had been un
able to come at. though he confessed
that, he had tried to worm it out of me
before parting company with me on tho
road to Charlotte.
I looked from one to another of my
judges.
"If this be all. gentlemen, the man
does but confirm my story." I said.
"It is not all.", said Shelby. "Mr.
Pengarvin, stand forth."
There was another stir in the back
grounding group * and the pettifogger
edged his way into the circle, keeping
well out of hand reach of me. How ha
had made shift to escape from Fergu
son's men, to change sides, and to turn
up .thus serenely In the ranks of the
over-mountain men. I know not to this
day. nor ever shall know.
. "Tell these gentlemen what you have
told me." said Shelby, onefly. and the
factor, cool and collected now. rehearsed
the undeniable facts: how in Charlotte I
had figured as a member of Lord Corn
wallis' military family; how. as Lord
Cornwallis' trusted aid-de-camp, I had
"Who says that word of me?" I de
manded, caring not much for that to
which his threat pointed, but something
for my good name.
Shelby turned and beckoned to a man
in the group behind him. "Stand out.
John Whittlesey." he directed; and I
found myself face to face with that rifle
man of Colonel Davle's party who had
been so fierce to hang me at the fording
of the Catawba.
But now again Sevier and Shelby, sec
onded by the fiery Presbyterian, William
Campbell, flung themselves into the
breach, pleading for delay and a fair
trial for such as were blood guilty. And
so the dismal night, made chill and com
fortless by the cold wind and most dole
ful by the groans and cries of tha
wounded, wore away, and the dawn oÂ£
the Sunday found us lying as we wera
in the bloody shambles of the hilltop.
The dead buried and the wounded
cared for In some rough and ready fash
ion, preparations were made in ail haste
for a speedy withdrawal from the neigh
borhood of the battlefield. Rumor had it
that Tarleton, with his invincible legion,
was within a few hours' march: and the
mountain m<?n, sodden weary with the
toils of the flying advance and the hard
fought conflict, were in no fettle to copo
with a fresh foe.
As yet I had not made myself known
to the patriot commanders, having my
hands and heart full with the care ot
poor Tybee. who was grievously hurt,
and being in a measure Indifferent to
what should befall me.
But now as we were about to march I
was dragged before the committee of
colonels and pnt to the question.
"Your uniform is a strange one to us.
sir." said Isaac Shelby, looking me up
and down with that heavy-lidded right
Â«-ye of his. "Explain your rank and
standing. If you please."
I told my story simply, and. as I
thought, effectively; and had only blaclc
looks for my pains.
"'Tls a strange tale, surely, sir â too
strange to.be believable." quote Shelby.
"You are a traitor. Captain Iretonâ of
the kind we need not cumber ourselves
with on a march."
For hia battleground Major Ferguson
chose the top of a forest-covered hill,
the last and lowest elevation in the spur
named that day Kings Mountain.
And if my hand were not sure enough
to draw you some speaking picture of
this, our epoch-marking battle of Kings
Mountain, which followed Indeed all too
swiftly, it falters still more on coming
to the task of setting forth the tragic
horrors of the dreadful after-night.
Wherefore I pray you will hold me ex
cused, my dears, if I hasten over tha
events tripping upon the heels of the
victory, touching upon them only as they
touch upon my tale.
â¢ But as for the stage setting of tha
after-scene you may hold in your mind's
eye the stony hilltop strewn with thÂ«
dead and dying; the huddle of cowed
prisoners at the wagon barricade; tha
mountaineers, mad with the. victor's
frenzy, swarming to surround us. 'Twas
a clipping from chaos and night gone
blood-crazed till Sevier and Isaac Shelby
brought somewhat of order out cÂ± it;
and then came the reckoning.
Of the seven hundred-odd prisoner*
the greater number were Tories, many
of them red-handed from scenes of ra
pine in which their present captors had
suffered the loss of all that men hold
dear. So you will not wonder that there
were knives and rifles shaken aloft and
tierce and vengeful counsels In which Mi
was proposed to put the captives one
and all to the cord and tree.
The camp was astir early the' next
xnorninz and it soon became noised about
that we were to fall back, but only so
far as might be needful to find a strong
position. From this It was evident that
a battle was Imminent, though as yet
there were no signs of the approach of
the patriots.
From the camp talk we, Tybee and I.
gleaned some- better information of tho
situation. A fortnight earlier Major
Ferguson had captured two of the over
mountain men ox Clark's party and had
sent them to the settlement on the
Watauga with a challenge in due form
âor rather with the threat to come and
lay the over-mountain region waste in
default of an instunt returp of the pio
neers to their allegiance to the king.
This challenge, so our scouts told us,
had been immediately accepted. Sevier
and Shelby had embodied some two hun
dred men each from the Watausa and
the Holston settlements, and colonel
William Campbell, the stout old Presby
terian Indian lighter, had joined them
with as many more Virginians.
Crossing the mountain these three
troops had fallen in with other scattered
parties of the border patriots uniler Ben
jamin Cleaveland, Major Chronicle and
Colonel Williams of South Carolina, un
til now, as the scouts reported the chal
lenged outnumbered tne challengers.
Learning this Ferguson, who was as
prudent as he was brave, thoughx it best
to make his stand at some point nearer
the main body of the army; and sd tha
withdrawal from Gilbert Town had fall
en into a retreat and a pursuit.
From what Captain de Peyster has
since told me there would seem to be
little doubt that the major meant to
flght when he had maneuvered himself
Into a favorable position; this in spite of
Lord Cornwallis' commands to the con
trary. In his dispatches he was con
tinually urging the need for a bold push
In his quarter and asking for Tarleton
and a sufficient number of the legion to
enable him to cope with a mounted en
emy. But be this as it may. the garbled
letter I had brought him turned what
ever scale there wa3 to turn. He had
now with him some eleven hundred reg
ulars and Tories, the latter decently well
drilled; he had every reason-to expect the
needed help from Cornwallis; and on the
night of my arrival he had word that
another Tory force under Major. Gibbs
would join him in a day or two at far
thest.

When all was settled the old man gave
us a supper of his humble fare, after
which we went Into the open again to sit
out the hours of waiting. The rain had
ceased, but the night was cloudy and the
darkness a soft black veil to shroud the
nearest objects. High overhead the au
tumn, wind was sighing In the Â¦ tree- tops,
and now and again a sharper gust would
bring down a pattering volley of lodged
rain droDs from the fallen leaves. â¢
So now I made him known to my pa
triarchal host, who all this time had
been standing guard at the cabin door
with the old Qucen's-arm for a weapon.
So we three sat- on the doorstone and
planned it out. When the night was far
enough advanced we would stalk the sol
diers in their camp, rparing life as we
could.
The bloodthirstiness of my two allies
was appalling. But I undertook to cool
the Indiana ardor, explaining that the
redcoat soldiers were the Longknlfe's
brothers, in a way. not to be slain save
In honorable battle. â¢ I am not sure
whether I earned the Catawba's con

back the way I had come. "Make fire

"We must take them," said I.
He nodded. "Kill 'em all; take scalp
Wan!" ' . ' â¢
I saw his drift, and though I knew
his courage well, the boldness of the
thing staggered me. He, too, had pene
trated to the inner lines of the British
encampment at Charlotte; and when they
had sought an Indian tracker to lift my
trail 'twas he who had volunteered. But

asked.
"What else did she say?" I demanded.
"No say anyt'ing else; *ay # good-by. f "
He turned upon me at that and I saw
why he had kept his face averted. He
had on the war palnt-of a Cherokee chief.
"Uncanoola good Chelakee now." he
grinned. "Help redcoat soldter find Cap

Luckily, he had the wit not to move.
"No kil! Lncanoola." he muttered, this
without the stirring of a muscle. Then,
as If he were talking' to the horse:*
"White squaw, she send 'um word; say
'good-by.' "
My point dropped as if another blade
had parried the thrust. - - "â¢Â¦

with the upstart a heaving nausea came
to supplement the headache, and for a
Ion- time I lay bat-blind and sick as any
landsman in his first gale at sea.
Tho sunlight was fading from the
high windows, and I was deep sunk In a
sick man's megrims before aught came
to disturb the silence of the cobwebbed
garret. : From nausea and racking pains
I had coma to the stage of querulous
self-pity. 'Twas monstrous, this bury
ing a man alive, ill, fettered, uncared
for, to live or die in utter solitude as
might happen. I could not < remotely
guess to whom I owed this dismal fate,
and was too petulant to speculate upon
it. But the meddler, friend or foe, who
had bereft me of my chance to die while
I was fit and ready came in for a Turk

It was in the midst of one of these Im

and light footsteps tiptoed to my bed
side. â¢ I shut my eyes willfully when a
voice low and tender asked: "Are you

"My lord is at supper at Mr. Stair's.
Have you news, captain?"
I drew breath ot relief. Happily the
loss of the day had not made .me .the
bearer of stale tidings. So I made an
swer with proper reticence, saying that
I hnd news,, but It was for Lord Corn
wallis' c;ir first of all. None the lesa, if
the commissary general were pleased to
come with me â
He took tlie hint at once; and he it waa
who procured me instant admittance to
the house, and who took upon himself
the responsibility of breaking In upon
the party in the supper room.
1 shall not soon forget the scene that
fronted us when we came into my lord's
preser.ee. The supper was in some sort
a gala feast held in honor of my lord's
accession to his earldom. The table,
lighted by great silver candelabra which
I recognized, as Ireton 'heirlooms, was
well filled around by the members of the
commander In chief's military family,
with the earl at the head and Mistress
Margery, bedight as befitted a lady of
quality, behind the tea urn at the foot..
At our incoming all eyes were turned
upon us, but it required ray lord's sharp
question to make me leave oft dwelling
upon my sweet lady's radiant beauty. ..
"How now. Captain Ireton? Do you
bring us news from the major?"
I broke the fascinating eychold and
turned slowly to face my fate. "
"I do, my lord."
â¢ "Well, what of him? You left him
hastening to rejoin with hia new loyalist
levies. I hope?"
I drew my sword, reversed it and laid
it upon the table. ., â¢
"May all the enemies of the common
wealth be even as he is, my lord," I said,
quietly.
Now, truly, I had hanged my petard
well, and 'twas plain the shock of it had
gone far to shatter the wall of â¢confidence
our enemies had builded on the field of
Camden and elsewhere. Had a hand gre
nade with the fuse alight been dropped
upon the table the consternation could
scarce have been greater. To a man the
tableful was up and thronging round me;
but above all the hubbub I heard a little
cry of misery from the table-foot where
my lady sat.
"How Is this, sir? â explain yourself!"
thundered my lord, forgetting for once
his mild suavity. . .
<â¢â¢ 'Tis but a brief tale, and I will make
it as crisp as may be in the telling," I
replied. "I came upon the major some
miles this side of the crossing of the
Broad. He was marching to rejoin you,
In accordance with his orders. But when
he had your lordship's command to stand
and fight, he obeyed." .. .
"My command? â but I gave him . no
such order!" >
"Nay, truly, you did .not â neither, in
the original nor in the duplicate, my
lord. ' But when we had waylaid Lieu
tenant Tybee and quenched the duplicate,
and had so amended the original as to
make It fit our purpose, the brave major
thanked you for what you had not done
and made his stand to await the upcom
ing of the over-mountain men."
For a moment I thought they would
hew me limb "from limb, but my lord
quelled the fierce outburst with a word.
"Put up your swords, gentleman. -Â¦.Â¦ We
shall know how to deal with this trait
or," he said. And then to me: "Go on,
sir, If you please; there has been a bat
tle, as I take it?"
"There has, indeed. The mountain
men came up with us In the afternoon of
the Saturday. In an- hour, one-third of
the major's force was dead or dying, the
major himself was slain and every living
man left on the field was a prisoner."
Again a dozen swords hissed from
their scabbards,' and again I beard the
little cry. of misery from the table-foot.
I bowed my head, looking momently to
pay the penalty; but once-more my lord
put the swords aside.
"Let us have a clean breast of it this
time. Captain Ireton,". .he 1 said. "You
know well what 'you have â¢ earned, and
nothing you, can say will make it better
or worse for. you. Was this your purpose
in making your submission to me?"
"It was." i . Â¦

met the cold anger in the womanish
HOW WE CAME TO THE BEGINNING
OF THE END.
As Margery had . promised. I passed
out of my garret prison and out of door
on that memorable evening of October
14 to find the British gone from Char

Joy." â¢ . - :.
Having. nothing to detain me. and be
ing bound In honor, by the wish of my
dear lady not to. follow and give myself
up to the retreating British general, I
"Good Lord!" I groaned; "are you a
woman or a. fiend?"
"Either or both, as you like to hold me.
sir. But come what might, I said you
should not die a felon's death. And you
haven't, as yet."
Â¦"Better a thousand times the rope and
tree. than that I should .rot by inches
here with you to sit by and gird at me.
Ah, my lady, you are having your re
venge of me." .
"Merci, encore. Shall I go away and
leave you?" -. s,
"No, not that." A cold sweat broke
out upon me in a sudden childish horror
of the solitude and the darkness and the
fetters. And then I added: "But 'twould
be angel kindness if you would leave off
torturing me. I am but a I man, dear
lady, and a sick man at that."
All in a flash her mood -changed and
she bent . to lay a cooling palm on my
throbbing temples. Â¦
"Poor Monsieur John!" she said softly;
"I meant not to make you suffer more,
but rather less." Then she found water
and a napkin to wring out and bind upon
my aching head.
At the touch and the word of womanly
sympathy I forgot all, and the love-mad
ness came again to blot out the very
present memory of how she had brought
me to this. '
"Ah, that is better â better," I sighed,
when the pounding hammers in my tem
ples gave me some surcease of the
agony.
"Then- you forgive me?" she asked,
whether jestingly or in earnest I could
not tell. ;
"There is none so much to forgive," I
replied.' "One hopeless day last summer
I put my life in pledge to you; and youâ
in common Justice you have the right to
do what- you will with It." '
"Ah; now you talk more like my old
time _ Monsieur John : with the healing
sword-thrust. But that day you speak of
was not more hopeless for you than for
me." - -.'"â¢Â¦ -"; :.*â¢>â¢ 'Â¦.- - : .-. - ..
"I know. It,", said I, thinking only of
how the loveless marriage must grind
upon .- her., Â¦-. ."But it must needs be hope
less for both till death steps in to break
the, bond."- . r . .;Â¦'..'.Â¦..' ' .'.
Againt she laughed, that same bitter
little laugh.
" "Indeed, it was a great wrong you did
that night, sir. I could wish, as heartily
as you,, that Â»it might be undone. . But
this Is Idle talk. Let me see if this key
And In the food-brlngings I could
neither make my lady stay nor answer
any question; this though I was hunger
ing to know what was going on beyond
the walls -of my garret prison. Indeed,
she would not even tell me how I had
been spirited away from the two ser
geants keeping watch over me in her
father's strong room below stairs. "That
is Scipio's secret." she would say, laugh-
Ing at me. "and he shall keep It.
But in the evening of the third day
the mystery bubble was burst, and I
learned from Margery's lips the thing I
longed to know. Lord Cornwallis, had
decided to abandon North Carolina, and
in an hour or two the army would be in
motion for withdrawal to the southward.
"Now. thanks be to God!" I said most
fervently. - "Kings Mountain has begun
the good work, and we shall show Far
mer George a thing or two he had not
guessed."
On thia, my lady drew herself up most
proudly and her lip curled.
"You forget, sir. you arc speaking to
Mr. Gilbert Stair's daughter."
"True," said I; "I did forget. We are
at cross purposes in this, as in all things
else. .,1 crave your pardon, madam."
Her eyes were snapping by now.
Never tell me. my dears, that eyes of the
blue-gray can not flash fire when they
will.
"How painstakingly you will go about
to make mp. hate you!" she burst out.
And then, all in the same breath: "But
you will be rid of me presently, for good
and all."
"Nay. then. Mistress Margery, you are
always taking an ell of meaning for my
inch of speech. 'Tis I who should do the
riddinsr."
"Mon DIeu!" she cried, in a sudden
burst of petulance; "I am sick to death
of all this! Is there no way out of this
coll that is strangling us both. Captain
Ireton?" *;
"I had thought to make a way three
days ago; did bo make It. but you kept
me from walking in it. Yet that way is
still open â If you will but drop a word
in my lord's ear when you go below
stairs."
"Oh. yea â a fin* thing; the wife betray
tho husband!" This with another lip
curl of scorn. "I have some shreds and
patches of pride left. sir. If you have
not."
"Then free me of my obligation to you
and let me do It myself. I am well
enough to hang."
"And so make me a consenting accom
plice? Truly, as I have said before, you
have a most knightly soul. Captain Ire
ton."
; ' I closed my eye3 in very weariness.
"You are hard to please, my lady."
"You have not to try to please me. sir.
I am going away â to-night."
"Going away?" I echoed. "Whither, If
I mayask?"
"My father has taken protection and
we shall go south with the army. As
Lord Cornwallis says. Mecklenburg Is a
hornet's nest of rebellion, and in an hour
or two after we are gone you will be
among your friends."
She made to leave me now, but I
would not let her go without trying the
last blunt-pointed arrow in the quiver of
expedients.
"Stay a moment." I begged. "You are
leaving the untangling of this coll you
speak of to a chance bullet on a battle
neld. Had you ever thought that the
church can undo what the church has
done?"
Again I had that bitter laugh which
was to rankle afterward In memory.
"You are a most desperate, pertina
cious man. Captain Ireton. Failing all
else, you would even storm heaven itself
to gain your end." she scoffed; then, at
the very pitch-point of the scornful out
burst she put her face in her hands and
fell a-sobbing as if her heart would
break. .
I knew not what to say or do. and end
ed,' manlike, by saying and doing noth
ing. And so. still crying softly, she let
herself out at the wainscot door, and this
was our leave-taking.
CHAPTER XLIV.
'A toast!" cried Richard, when the
bottle came, springing to his feet with
the glass held high- "To. the dear lady

We drank it standing; and after would

"I had thought of my part of that."
he said in a muse. Then he came allvts
to the risk I should run. "But you can't
well go back to Cornwallis now. Jack;
'tis playing with death. There will be
other news-carriers â there are sure to
be: and a single breath to whisper what
you have done will hang you higher than
Hainan."
I shrugged at this. "'Tis but a war
hazard."
He looked at me curiously. I saw a
shrewd question in his eyes and set in
stant action as a barrier in the way of
its asking.
"Let us find Colonel Sevier and beg us
the loan -of a pair of horses.". said I; and
eo we v/ere' kept from coming upon the
dangerous ground of pointed questions
and evasive answers.
Somewhat to my surprise.- both Sevier
and Shelby fell in at once with our pro
ject, commending it heartily; and I
learned from the lips of that courtliest
of frontiersmen, "Nollchucky Jack," the
real reason for the proposed hurried re
turn of the over-mountain men. The
Cherokecs. never to be trusted, had, as it
Koemed, procured war supplies from the
British posts to the southward, and were
even now on the verge of an uprising'.
By forced marches these hardy borderers
hoped to reach their homes in time to de
fend them. Otherwise, as both comman
ders assured us, they would take the
field with Gates.
We made our acknowledgments; and
when I had bespoken good care for Ty
bee we took leave of these stout fighters,
and of old Ephraim as well, since the old
borderer was to serve as a guide for the
over-mountain men. at least till they
were come upon familiar ground to the
westward.
Once on the high road we pushed on
briskly for the river, nor did we draw
rein until the sweating beasts were pick
ing their way in the darkness down the
last of the hills which sentinel the Ca
tawba to the westward.
An hour later we rode the scant mile
through the stubble fields to my old roof
tree. As you would guess, we looked to
find the manor house turned Into an out
post headquarters; but now we were des
perate enough to face anything.
Howbeit. not to rush blindly into the
jaws of a trap, we first routed out the
old black majordomo at the negro quar
ters; and when we learned from him that
the great house was quite deserted, we
took possession and had the black make
U3 a rousing fire in the kitchen ' arch.
Nay. more; when we had steamed our
selves a little dry we had old Anthony
Btew and grill for us and fetch us a bot
tle of that Madeira of my father's laying
in. Â¦ â¢ . ~
"Good! then I have a thought which
may Ftand tor what it is worth. To
make the most of this victory over Ma
jor Ferguson. Gates should be apprised
at once and by a sure tongue; and his
lordship should have the news quickly,
too, and in a lump, as you say. Let us
take horse and ride post, we two: you
to Gates at Hillsborough and I to Char
lotte."
He shook his head. "1 have none
worth the name."
"Then you are not commitied to Colo
nel Sevii-r for a term of service?"
"No: nor to Cleaveland. nor .McDowell,
nor any. We heard there was to be fight
ins: hereaway â Kphratm Yeates and I â
and wo came as volunteers."
"'Tis nigh on to a crime." said I.
"This victory, smartly followed up,
rr.ipht wi-ll be the turning of the tide for
us."
But the lad woulu not admit the quali
fying condition. "'Twill be no less as
it is." he declared. "Mark you. Jack;
'twill put new life into the cause and
nerve every man of ours afres'.i. And
as for the redcoats, if my Lord Com*
wallis gets the news of it in a lump, as
he should. Gates will have plenty of time
to set himself In motion, slow as he Is."

1 had claimed that the orders had been
bo f.ltf red as to delay the major's retreat
and so to bring on the battle. But they
had just found Lorrl Cornwallis' letter in
my pockrt. still sealed and undelivered.
And the tenor of it was precisely oppo
site to that of an ordÂ»r calculated to de
ley the major's march, as Mr. Jennifer
could see ir he would read it.
While Sevler was talking the old bor
der* r was fBMWtes in the breast of hi3

packet of papers tied about with red

" 'Pears to me like you Injun killers

he said, as coolly as if he were address

not sooner that Cap'n John here is tell

The papers were examined hastily, and
presently John Sevier lighted upon the
dispatch I had carried and delivered.
Thereat the colonels put their heads to
gether; and then my caso was reopened,
with Sevier as spokesman.
"We have a letter here which appears
to be the origiaal order to Ferguson,
Captain Jreton. Can you repeat from
memory the postscriptum which you say
Â¦was ad'ieJ to it?'

There was a rush for the wagon bar

his face. But the bullet flew wide and

MARCHING ORDERS.
CHAPTER XLII.
I knew well enough whom I had to
thank for this, and was set wondering
that my lady's charity was broad enough
to mantle even by this little my latest
sins against the king's cause. None the
less. I ate and drank gratefully, drain
ing the tea dish to the dregs â which, by
the way, were strangely bitter.
I had scarce finished picking tho bonea
of the capon before sleep came. again to
drag at my eyelids, :i drowsiness so
masterful that I could make no head
against it. And go. with the bitter taste
of the tea still on my tongue, I fell away
a second time into the pit of forgetful
ness. . â¢ '
When I awakened from what seemed
In the memory of it the most unresting
sleep I ever had. it was no longer night,
/and I was stretched upon the oaken set
tle in that same lumber garret where I
had been bedded through that other
nipht of hiding. So much I saw at the
waking glance; and then I realized.
IN WHICH I DRINK A DISH OF TEA.
Being without specific orders what to
do with me, my two sergeant bailiffs
thrust me into that little den of a strong
room below stairs where I had once
found the master of the house, and one
of them mounted guard while the other
fetched the camp armorer to iron me. ..
The shackles securely on. I was left to
content me as I could, with .the door
ajar and my two Jailers hobnobbing be
fore it. Having done all I had hoped to
do, there was nothing for it now but to
wait" upon the consequences. So, hitch
ing my chair up to the oaken table, I
made a pillow of my fettered wrists and
presently fell adoze.
I know not what hour of the night it
was when the half-blood Scipio, who was
Mr. Gilbert Stair's body-servant, came in
and roused me. I started up suddenly
at his touch, making no doubt it was my
summons. But the mulatto brought me
nothing worse than a cold fowl and a
loaf, with a candle end to seo to eat
them by. and a dish of hot tea to wash
them down. Â¦ '

We were still sitting thus before the
kitchen arch when the dawn began- to
dim the firelight, and the work of the
nev/ day confronted us. Pinned down,
old Anthony confessed that some two or
three horses of the Appleby Hundred
stables had escaped the hands of the for
agers of both sides; and two fresh ani
mals he fetched for us. Of the twain
one chanced to be Blackstar, the good
beast which had carried me from New

Dick a mile on the road to Salisbury, and
bade him farewell.
His last word to me was one of gener
ous caution.
"Remember, Jack; 'haste, haste, post
haste.' is your watchword. There will
be other couriers in from the battle field
at Kings Mountain; and you must hang
and fire your news petard and vanish be
fore they come to betray you."
'Trust me," said I. evasively; and bo
we parted, he to gallop eastward, and I
to charge down peaceably upon that

"I have, my lord â since tn<* day nine

"Then it was a farrago of lies you told

"A'ot wholly. It was your lordship s

"And Captain Sir Francis Falconnst

"L do so hope and trust, my lord."
He turned short on his heel, and for a
moment a silence as, of death fell upon
tho room. Then he took the Ferara from
the table and sought to break it over hjs
knee; but the good blade, like the cause
it stood for, bent like a withe and would
not snap.'
"Put this spy in irons and clear the
room," he ordered sharply. And this is
how the little drama ended: with the
supper guests crowding to the door; with
ray lord pacing baclc and lorth at the
table-heau; witu two sergeants bearing
me away to await, where and how 1
knew not, the word which should efface
me and leave clear for my lad Dick tne

took horse and rode to Salisbury, w" ere
I had the great good fortune to >.lnd
Dick, already breveted a captain in Colo
nel Washington's command, hurrying his
troop southward to whip on the British
withdrawal. .
Here was my chance to drown heart
burnings in an onsweeping tide of ac
tion, and then and there I became a gen
tleman volunteer In Dick's company,
asking nothing of ray dear lad save th;it
I might ride at his stirrup and share his
hazards.
Touching the hazards, there were
plenty of them in the seven weeks pre
ceding and the month or more following
our new general's coming to take the
field, as you may know in detail it you
care to follow the gallopings of Colonel
Washington's light-horse troop througii
the pages of the histories. But these
have little or naught to do with my t:Ue,
and I pass them by with tne word jruti
will anticipate: that in all the dashes and
forays and brushes with the cr.emy'a for
aging parties and outposts, no British or
Tory bullet coultl iind its billet la tj ;e
man who was enamored of death.
As for my most miserable entangle
ment, the lapse of time made it ne:thcr
better nor worse, nor greatly different
and there was little in all the skirmish
ings and gallopings to beat off the ban
dog of conscience, or that other and still
nercer wild beast of starved love, that
gnav.ed at me day and night.
Though the hope for some easement
would now and then lift Us head. I was
reminded daily that hope Itself was
hopeless; and when the days lengthened
Into weeks and the weeks into months
bringing no salving for tho double hurt'
I knew that time could only make me
love Margery the more; that there tv
wounds that heal, and other3 that open
afresh at each remembrance of the hand
that gave them.
One grain of comfort I had in all these
dreary weeks. 'Twas while we were
quartering in Charlotte, and I had
chanced to fall upon tho half-blood
Scipio, who had been left by Gilbert
Stair to be tho caretaker of the deserted
town house.
As you will remember, 'twas he who
had brought me tho drugged tea. and the
word I had from him made m* hot with
shame for the cruel imputation I had
put upon my dear lady. "Yas, sar: gib
urn sleep-drop to make buckra massa hoi*
still twell we could tote 'im froo da win
dow an' roun' de house an' up dÂ« sta'r.
Soljah gyards watch ura mighty close
dat nignt; yes, fiar!" And thus thia
nightmaro thougat of mine was thrnea
into another thorn to prick me on the
self-accusing side. 'Twas her keen wo
man's wit, and no cold-blooded plan to
cheat the gallows, that made her give me
the sleepiag draught. Having the object
lesson of my late surrender before her,
she had no mind to let me mar the res
cue by waking to forbid it. And when I
taxed her. 'twas nctural pride that drove
her to let me so on thinking the unwor
thy thought, if so I would.
I did penance for my disloyalty as a
despairing lover might, and I do think it
made mo tenderer of Dick, whose bear
ing to mo through all these tempestuous
weeks was most nobly generous and for
giving. I say forgiving because I was
often bat the curstest of companions, as
you would guess. For when I was not
bent upon finding that wicket gate of
death which would let me from the path
of these two. I was in a wicked tertian
of the mind, whose chill was of despair,
and whose fever was a hot desire to lock
once more into the eyes of my dear lady
before the wicket gate should open for
me.
'Twas this desire that finally drew me
to her â the desire and another thing,
which shall have mention In Its place.
The new y?ar was now come, and the
southern army, as yet too weak to cope
with the tr.pmy, was cut Into two wings
of observation; one under General
Greene himself at Cheraw Hill, tlie other
and lesser In the knoll forests of the
Broad with Daniel Morgan for Its chief;
both watching hawk-like the down-sit
ting of my Lord Cornwallis. who seemed
to have taken root at Winnsborough.
As you will know. Washington' 3 light
horse was,wlth Morgan; and we ate,
drank and well-nigh slept In the saddle.
But for all our scoutlngs and outriding3.
and all Dan Morgan's hearty cursings at
the ill success of them, wo could coma
by no suro inkling of tiord Cornwallis'
designs. As I have said, th^ British com
mander seemed to have taken root and
was now waiting to sprout and grow.
It was at this lacli-knowledge crisis
that I volunteered to go to the British
camp at Winnsborough In ray old quality
of spy; did this and had my leave and or
ders before Dick learned of it.
Left to my own devices. I fear I should
have slipped away without telling Jenni
fer. But. as so many times before, fata
Intervened to drive me where I had not
meant to go. On the morning set for my
departure I woke to find a letter pinned
to the ground beside me with an Indian
scalping knlfa thrust through it.
Dick was sitting by the newly-kindled
fire, nursing his knees and most palpably
waiting for ma to wake and find my mis
sive.
"What is it?" I asked, eying the oml-
nous thing: distrustfully.
** 'Tis a letter, as you see. Uncannola
left It." Then most surlily: **'Tis from
Madge, and to you. There is your name
on the back of it."
At this I must needs read the letter,
with the lad looking on as if he would
eat me. 'Twaa dated at Winnsboroush.
and was brief and to the point.
- "Monsieur: When last we met you said
the church might undo what the church
had done. I have spoken to the good
Pere Matthieu. and he has conssnted to

It is necessary that he should have your

way to communicate with Pere Matthieu.
who is at present with us under our bor
rowed roof here." \
That was all. and it was signed only
with her initial. I read it through twice
and then again to gain time. Fot, Dick
was waiting.
"'Tis a mere formal matter of busi
ness." said I, when I could put him off
no longer.
"Business?" he queried, the red light
of suspicion coming and going In his
eye. "What business can you have with
Mistress Madge Stair, pray?"
?"Tis about â it touches thÂ« title to
Appleby Hundred," said I. equivocating
as clumsily as a schoolboy caught In a
fault. "Of course you know that the
confiscation act of the North Carolina
Congress re-established my right and
title to the estate r*
- "No," said he; "you never told mÂ«.**
Then: "She writes you about this?"
"About a matter touching it. as I
say."
"As you did not say." he growled;
after which a silence came between us.
I holding the open letter in my hand and
he staring glomily at the back of it.
When the silence grew portentous I
â¢ told him of my design to go a-spying.
He looked me in the eye and bis smile
was not pleasant to see.
"You are lying most -clumsily. Jack;
or at best you are telling me but half
the truth. You are going to see Mistress
Margery." - ,â¢ L
"That is altogether as it may happen.^
I retorted, striving hard to keep down
the flame of insensate rivalry which his
accusings always kindled in me.
"It is not. winnsborough is neither
London nor yet Philadelphia, that you
may miss her in the crowd. And you do
not mean to miss her."
"Well? And if I do chance to see her
â what then?"
"Don't mad me. Jack. You should know
by this time what a fool she has made of
me."
" f Tis your own folly." I rejoined hot
ly. "You should blame neither the lady
nor the man trÂ» whom she has given
nothing save â "
'Save whatr* he broke in savagely.
I recoiled on th* brink as I had so
many times before. Trie months of wait
ing for the death 1 craved had hardened
me. '-v '
"Save a thing you would value lightly
enough without her love. Let us have
done with this bickering; find the colo
nel and ask his leave to go with me, tf
you like. Then you may do the love
making while I do the spying."
"No." said he: "not while you stand it
upon such a leg as that."
I reached across and gripped his hand
and wrung it. "Shall we never have the
better of thesa senseless vaporingsT* I
cried. "'Tis as you say; I can neither
live sane nor die mad without another
sight of her. Dick, and that is the plain
truth. And yet. mark me. this next see
ing, of her will surely set a thing in train
that will make her yours and not mine.
Get your leave and come with me on
your own terms. Mayhap she will show

"God in heaven!" I gasped: "'twas

I hated to think on afterward.
"You have a most chivalrous soul.
Captain Ireton. I do not wonder you are
so fierce to shake it free of the poor
body of clay."
'â¢But you do not deny It!" I cried.

But It did prove to be the right one;
and. when the Irons were oft I felt moro
like a man and lesa like a baited bear.
"That is better," said I, drawing
breath of relief. "I bear my Lord
Charles.no malice, but 'twas a needless
precaution,. this Ironing of a man who

"But you are going to run away." Â«he

door- and turned to give me my answer.
"No; you are a soldier, and â and I will
not be a gallows-wldow. Do you hear,
sir? If you are so eager to die, there is
always the battlefield?' And with that
she left me.
I may pass over the two succeeding
days in the silence I was condemned to
endure through the major part of them.
After that first visit. Margery came only
at stated Intervals to bring me food and
drink, and ray nurso was an old black
beldame, either deaf and dumb, or else

THE SUNDAY CALL."
2She went before us. padding the way
with whatever came first to hand. rugs,
curtains, table-covering, and I know not
-what beside; and by the time the Brit
ish troopers were hammering at thÂ«Â»
outer door, we were deep within the old
mansion and had made shift to drag the
unwilling horses by one and two-step
descents to a room half under and half
out of ground, which served as a sort of
Dick's answer was another burst of
laughter, loud enough, you would think,
to be heard by those beyond the door.
"Behold four witless brute beasts.
Mistress Madge â two horses and two
assts." h? said.' And then to old An
thony: "Open the door, Tony, and invite
the gentlemen in."
But Margery was before him. Ah. my
dears, a man's wit is like a matchlock,
fizzing and sputtering its way noisily to
find the powder while the enemy hath
time to ride up and saber the musketeer;
but a woman's is like the spark In a tin
derbox â e quick snip of flint and steel
and you have your fire. In a flash my
lady had torn down the heavy curtains
from an inner doorway and was carpet
ing a horse path for us to the rear.
"Quick!" she cried: "lead them gently,
for the love of heaven!"
It was in the very midst of his gust of
ill-timed merriment, while 'the horses
were nosing niftlly at their strange sur
roundings, and the hoof strokes of the
redcoat troop could be plainly heard on
the gravel of the avenue, that I chanced
to lift my eyes to the stair. There look
ing down upon us. with speechless as
toundment in the blue-gray eyes, stood
our dear lady.
Another instant and she was with us,
stamping her foot and crying: "Mon
Dieu! What is this? Are you gone mad.
both of you?"
Judge for yourselves, my dears, if this
were the time, place or crisis for a man
to fling himself upon the hall settle, grip
his ribs and laugh like any lack wit. Yet
this is what Richard Jennifer did.
"So far. so good," quoth Dick. Then
to the old black, who had stood by.
saucer-eyed and speechless,, the while:
"Anthony, do you be as big a numbskull
as you were born to be, and hold these
redcoat gentlemen In palaver till we can
win out at the back."
The old majordomo nodded his good
will, but now my slow wit came in play.
"We've done it now," said I. "The
horses will go out as they came In. or
not at all. Had you forgotten the stair
at the back?"
Hearing his master's call, the gray
pricked his ears and came obediently,
with the sorrel tagging at his heels.
A moment later, when the up-coming
troop was hidden by a turn In the
avenue, we had the pair of them in the
hall with the door shut and barred be
hind them- - \.
What Richard's most natural resent
ment would have led to. In what new
tangle of the net of bitterness we might
have been enmeshed, we were spared the
knowing. For when he said, "She is not
here." two happenings intervened to give
us both other things, to think of.
The first was the advent, at the far
end of the oak-lined avenu* of a troop
of British light horse, trotting leisurely;
the second was the swinging Inward of
the door of unwelcome, with old Anthony
grinning and bowing behind It.
Now when you have fairly surprised a
fox in the open, he asks nothing more
than a hole to hide in. There were the
hunters coming up the avenue; and here
was our dodge hole gaping before us.
So. as hunted things will, we took earth
quickly; though, truly, 'twas an ostrich
trick rather than a fox's, since we left
the horses standing without to advertise
our presence to all and sundry.
It was Richard who first found the
wit to realize the ostrich play.
"The horses! We may as well have left
the town crier outside to ring his bell
and tell the redcoats we are here." Â¦ he
would say; and before I knew what he
would be at he had snatched the door
open and was whistling softly to his big
gray.
CHAPTER XUX
IN WHICH A LAWYER HATH HIS
FEE.
"We shall know shortly." said I; and
truly, we did, being well-nigh enveloped
and ridden down by the fringe of Ught
horse deploying to pioneer the way.
The Catawba nodded, and made the
nod good by setting us dry-shod on the
farther bank of the brown flood. By, the
time we had the horses rubbed down and
resaddled" 'twas twilight in the open and
night dark in the wood; but we were on
our own ground and knew every by-path
through the forest. Â¦ â¢ Â¦
So, when we had sent the Indian back
to carry news of us to General Davidson
at the lower ford, and to advertise him
of our purpose, we mounted to begin a
scouting Jaunt, keeping to the wood
paths and bearing cautiously northward
toward the enemy's camp at Forney's
plantation.
. At times we were close upon the Brit
ish sentries, with every nerve strained
tense for fight or flight; anon we would
be making wide detours through bog and
fen. or beneath the black network of wet
branches with the rain-soaked leaf beds
under foot to make the horses' treadlngs
as noiseless as a cat's.
None the less. In the fullnes of time â
'twas near about midnight as we guessed
it â we had our patience well rewarded.
Hovering on the confines of the camp we
heard the muffled drum-tap of the re
veille.'and soon, there was the stir of an
army making ready, for. the march-^gÂ£S
"Which- way will It be. north or
south?" whispered Dick, when we had
dismounted to cloak the heads of the
horses..
"How is thatr* said pick; and the
query elicited a bit of news to make us
prick our ears. The Catawba had been In
the British camp at Forney's, posturing
Again as a Cherokee friendly to the
king's side. Some sudden movement had
been determined upon, though what it
was to be He could not learn. At the end
of his own resources he had crossed the
river In a stolen pirogue to find and warn
us.
"What say you, Dick?" I asked, when
we had heard the Catawba through.
The lad was holding his lip in his
hand and scowling as one who pits duty
against Inclination.
"'Tis our cursed luck!" he gloomed.
Then he swore It out by length and
breadth, and. when the air was cleared,
let me have what was In his mind.
"After all. 'tis like enough we should
find Appleby house deserted. Gilbert
Stair will cling to Lord Comwallis' coat
skirt &s long as he can for sheer safety's
sake. At all events, our business must
wait; the country's weal comes first."
Then to the Indian: "If we can make
the beasts take the water, will you ferry
us across, chief?"
At this we shook hands with him
again, well pleased 1 that our stanch ally
should have recognition at the hands of
the general. Then I would ask If he
were on the way to raise his tribesmen
to flght with us. . , . â ,
"Blmeby; no have time now; big thing
over yonder." pointing across the river.
"Manitou Cornwall fool Great War Chief,
mebbe, hey?"
"How!" said he; "heap how! Chief
Harris glad; wah! Make think have to
go to Sal'bury to find Captain Longknlfe
and Captain Jennif. Heap much glad!"
"Chief Harris?". I queried. "Who may
he be?"
The Catawba drew himself up and
drummed upon his breast.
"Chief Harris here." he answered
proudly.* "The Great War Chief." by
which we understood he meant General
Greene, "say all Catawba take warpath
'gainst redcoat; make Uncanoola head
man; give 'urn new name. Wah!"
We were guessing at this. Richard and
I. as we jogged on together down the
river ford, and were agreed that could
my lord cross the flooded river without
loss of time, his better chance would bo
to fall upon our main at Salisbury or
thereabouts. But as to the possibility of
his crossing, we fell apart.
"Lacking another drop of rain, we are
safe for forty-eight hours yet," Dick
would say, pointing to the brimming
river rolling Its brown flood at our right
as we fared on. "And with two days'
start we shall hav.e him burning . more
than his camp wagons to overtake us."
"Have it so, if you will." said I. to end
the argument. "But this I know: were
Dan Morgan or General Greene, or you
or I, in Lord Cornwallis' shoes, the two
days would not be lost."
1 Jennifer laughed. '"Leave the rest out.
Sir Hannibal Ireton. and tell what you
would do." he said, mocking me.
We. were- at that bend in the road

us toâ" He stopped in mid sentence,
drew rein and shifted his sword hilt to
the front. ' â¢ ' Â¦ "â¢: '
"What Is it?" I asked.
For reply he pointed me to a canoe
half -hidden -in the bushes â¢ where road
â¢side and river edge came together.
I laughed. "An empty pirogue. Shall
we charge and run it through?"
'"Hist!" said he; "that canoe was afloat
a minute since. Mark the paddle â 'tis
dripping yet."
As he spoke an Indian stood up In the
bushes beside the pirogue, holding out
his empty bands in token of amity. We
rode up and were presently shaking
hands with our old-time ally, the Cataw
ba.
For the others, Huger and Williams
Â¦Were liurryiiifc up from Cheraw to meet
the general at Salisbury; and General
Daviuson. with a regiment of North Car
olina volunteers, was set to keep the
fords pf the Catawba.
As for the British commander's ln
tendings, we had conflicting reports. Two
days earlier. Lord Comwallis had
burned his heavy baggage at Ramsour's
Mill, and so we had assurance that the
pursuit was only delayed. But whether,
when he should break his camp at For
ney's plantation; he would go northward
after Morgan and the prisoners, or cross
the river at some nearhand ford to chase
our main, none of our scouts could tell
us. '
, 'Twas late in the afternoon of the last
day of January I when we set out to
gether, Jennifer and I, from the camp of
conference at Sherrard's Ford.
The military situation, lately so criti
cal for us, had reached and passed one
of its many subcllmaxes. Morgan's lit
tle army, with its prisoners still safe in
hand, was on its way northward to Char
lottesville, in Virginia, and only the offi
cers remained behind to confer with
General Greene.

CHAPTER XLVIII.
"Make your way to th* clock landing
of the stair; I must have speech with
you." It said: and for a wonder I was
cool enough to obey with no more than
a sidelong glance at my lady passing on
I went on, drifting aimlessly from
group to group and dallying of set pur
pose. If I had read Colonel Tarleton's
glance aright the moments were grow
ing diamond-precious: but as yet neither
half of my errand was done. Come what
might. I must see Margery again and
have nÂ«*r teu me where and how to find
the priest: and 'twas borne In upon me
that she would come back to seek me as
soon as she could be free of her partner
in the dance.
The forecast as to my lady had its ful
fillment while yet the splnetter was
striking out the final chords of the min
uet- A lady dropped her kerchief, and I
was before her swain in stooping to pick
it up. As I bowed low In returning the
bit of lace to its owner, a voice that I
had learned to know and love whispered
In my ear.
He swore softly. "Never a cursed
word: less than nothing of any interest
to Dan Morgan."
"We must try again. "Twill surely be
talked of here if the army is about to
move. Do you take a turn In the ante
room and meet me in a quarter of an
hour at the outer door."
At the word Dick promptly lost him
self In the throng while I made a slow
circuit of the refreshment table. Once I
thought I had a clew when a girl hang
inn on the arm of an infantry lieutenant
said: "Will it be true that you will pres
ently go out to hunt down the rebels,
Mr. Thornicroft?" But the prudent lieu
tenant smiled and put her off cleverly,
leaving his fair questioner â and meâ
none the wiser.
Dick's bow was an elaborate hiding of
his tell-tale face; but the colonel's was
the slightest of nods, and I could feel
the sloe-black eyes of him boring Into
ray very souL
Had my lady given him but a mo
ment's time I make no doubt he would
have come instantly at the truth and the
little farce would have been turned into
a tragedy on the spot But she gave htm
no time. The spinet in the ballroom al
cove wan tinkling out the overture to a
minuet, and she laid the tips of her
dainty fingers on the colonel's arm.
"This will be ours to walk through,
will It not. Colonel Tarleton?" she said,
playing the sprightly minx to the very
climax of perfection. Then she dipped
us a curtsy. "Au revoir. gentlemen. 'Tis
a thousand pities you had not joined
sooner and so had the red coat and small
eword to grace you here."
When they were gone Dick laughed
sardonically.
"Saw yvÂ»u ever such a cold-blooded lit
tle jade in all your life? 'Twas with me
as it was with you; I. too. stumbled upon
them, and the colonel bustled me and set
his heels upon my foot I daresay I
ehould have Had myself in irons in an
other moment but for Madge. She
slipped in between and Introduced us as
sweetly as you please."
"Nevertheless." said L "the colonel
recognized us both."
"No! Think you so?"
â¢"Tis certain enough to play upon.
What we do now must be quickly done
or not at all. What have you over
heard T* â¢
"La, Mr. Septimus; how you startled
me!" she cried. Then, without a tremor
of the lip or a pause for breath-taking.
Ehe presented me: "Colonel Tarleton;
Mr. Septimus Ireton of Iretondene. In
Virginia." And next to Dick: "Mr.
Richaid; ray good friend. Mr. Ireton."
'Twas done bo cleverly and with such
tn air that even Dick, who had known
her from childhood, was struck dumb
with admiration, as his face sufficiently
advertised. And. Indeed. I had much ado
to play my own part with any decent
self-possession, though I did make shift
to bow stiffly, and to say. "I see I
should have brought the Iretondene title
deeds with me tp make you sure that I
urn not my rebel cousin John. Mistress
Margery. Your servant. Colonel Tarle
ton; and yours, Mr. Richard."
Here was a halter with a double snaf
fle at the end of it, was the thought that
Casned upon me; and I was gathering
my wits to brazen it out in some such
manner as to leave Jennifer unattainted
when my lady gave a little start and a
shriek.

The wearer of the sleeve had her back

'Twas with some notion of finding
ampler room for my feet that I euged
away through the fringing wall-crowd in
the dancing room toward a curtained
archway at ihe back. As yet I had over
heard naught save the silly ptrsiliage of
the belles and beaux â a word htre and
another there â and I was beginning to
fear that this was as poor a place to
look for information as was tne pot
house, when a thing befell to set me
a-quiver with all the thrillings the hu
man heart-strings can thruna into onfe
and the same instant of time.
As we had hoped to find it. this rout at
Marter Harndon's was a stifling jam. and
a good half of the guests were in civilian
plain clothes, neitner Paris nor London
, having as yet reached so far into the
Carolina plantations as to proscribe
homespun and to prescribe the gay tog
geries of the courts. This for the men.
1 hasten to add; lor then, as now. our
American dames and maids would put a
years cropping of the plantation on
their backs, thinking nothing of it; and
there was no lack of shimmering siiKs
and stiff brocades, of high-piled coif
fures, paint, patches and poÂ» iler at this
merry-making at Harndon Acres.
Lacking an introducer, and wani
ing. moreover. nothing save the
leave to have standing room in tne
throng as lookers-on, we gave Mr. Mar
rnaduke lian;don. a sleek, rotund little
gentleman, smirking and bjwing and
tapping the lid of his silver snuffbox, a
wide berth; and witu an agreement to
meet later for the comparing 01 notes,
Jennifer and I went apart at the door of
the ballroom, each to lose himself in the
assembled company as an Otter slips into
a pool, namely, without rufflir.g it.
'Twas easily done. Wimisouro-jgh had
by this time become a refuge camp for
ail the loyalists in the region round
about, and there were many in the pres
ent company who were strangers one 10
another, uneasy, shifting figures in the
gay throng, beneath the notice alike of
haughty dames and prinking da:;ay olh
cers. Beneath the notice, i say; yet I
would qualify this, for more thi-n one of
the epauletted macaronis trod upon ray
toes or bustled me rudely in the crus.i
till I trembled, not for my own self-cun
trol. but for Richard s. making sure that
the lad was having no more gentlemanly
welcome than I.
This adventure of ours into Winnsbor
ough bore fruit at the start- The town
was a-bubble over Master Hamdon's fes-.
tivities for the evening, and Dick and I
determined on the instant of our arrival
in town to attend it. We did.

"Not I." Dick said, ruefully.
The old man chuckled again.
"Ye ain't old enough, neither one o* ye,

to fish out the Innards of an inlmy's se
crets. Colonel Tarleton. hoss. foot. and

that what you youngsters was trying to
find out?" . ,...â¢:
A rauch-bepowdered captain of cavalry
was coming up the stair to claim her,
and I was- fain to let her go. But at my
passing of her to the step below, I whis
pered: "I shall keep the tryst â my first
and last with you. dear lady. Adieu."
So soon as she was gone I made haste
to find Richard, having, as I feared,
greatly overstayed my appointment to
meet him at the door. He was not
among the promenaders in the hall, so I
"Nothing." I cut in swiftly; "you are
speaking now to your husband â not to
the spy. Go on. If you please."
"We shall return to Appleby Hundred
within the fortnight There, If you
are stillâ r lf you desire It, you may meet
the good cure, and â "
We had talked on through the meas
ures of a cotillon, and the dancers, warm
and wearied, were beginning to fill the
entrance hall below. Our poor excuse for
privacy would be gone In a minute or
two. and she spoke quickly.
"You shall see Father Matthieu, and I
will help you. But you must not linger
here. In a few days the army will be
moving northwardâ Oh, heavens! what
have I said!" .
"Your pardon. I pray you; I see now
'tis a thing we must both bury out of
sight But to the other â the matter
which has brought me hither; will you
put me in the way of finding Father
Matthieu T'
"Your father's motives have ever been
misunderstandable to me. What could
he hope to gain by such a thing?"
I had no sooner said It than I could
hive bitten my masterless tongue. For
In the very voicing of the wonder I saw,
or thought I saw, Gilbert Stair's pur
pose. Since I had not made good my
promise to die and leave the estate to
Margery, he would at least make sure of
his daughter's dowry In It by putting It
beyond us to set the marriage aside as a
thing begun but not completed. So, hav
ing this behind-time flash of after-wit, I
made haste to efface the question I Tiad
asked.
She was flushing most painfully, and I
was scarce more at ease. But having
gone thus far, I must needs let the
thought consequent slip into words.
"Thank you." I said, meaning it from
the bottom of my heart. "Now one thing
more.. and you Ehall send me to Father
Matthieu. 'Tis a shameful thing to
speak of, but the thought of It rankles
and will rankle till I have begged you to
add It to the things forgotten. That
morning in your dressing room â **
She put up her hinds as If she would
push the words back,
"Spare me. sir," she begged. "There
are some things that must always be un
speakable between us. and that Is one of
them. But if it will help you to know
that I know â how. â how you came
there â "
"But I have not forgotten them, nor
ever shall. Will you say you forgive me,
Margery?"
"For thinking I had poisoned you?
How do you know I did not?"
"I have seen Sciplo. Will you shrive
me for that disloyalty, dear lady?"
"Did I not say I had forgotten it?"
"To do the bidding of your letter, and
to say that while I live I shall be
shamed for the bitter words I gave you
when I was sick."
"I mind them not; I had . forgotten
them." f he said.
"Your father holds but. a confiscator's
title, and it. with many others, has been
voided by the Congress of North Caro
lina. Richard Jennifer is my dear
friend, and you â
" "I begin to understand â a little," she
said, and now her voice was low and she
would not look at me. Then in the same
low tone: "But now â now you would
be free again?"
"How can you ask?Â» As matters stand
I have marred your life and Dick's most
hopelessly. Do you wonder that I
have been reckless of the hangman?
that I care not for my interfering life
at this moment, save as the taking of
it may involve you and Richard?"
"No. surely." she said, still speaking
softly. And now she gave me her eyes
to look into, and the hardness was all
melted out of them. "Did I you come
here, under the shadow of the gallows,
to tell me this. Monsieur John?'
"There shall be no more half-confi
dence between us, dear lady. I had my
leave of General Morgan on the ! score
of our need for better information of
Lord Comwallis' designs; but I should
have come in any cas?<r â wanting the
leave. m"y commission as a /ipy, or any
other excuse."
"To tell me this?"
" "I was the last will and testament of
one John Irr-ton, gentleman, in which
he bequeathed to Margery, his wife, his
estate of Appleby Hundred."
"Api-leby Hundred?" she echoed. "But
my father â "
'I wss but a short-sighted fool, and
r.o prophet." I rejoined, striving hard to
keep the bitterness of soul out of my
words. "At the moment it seemed the
only way out of the pit of doubt into
which my word to Colonel Tarleton had
plunged you. But there was another
motive. \ou saw the paper I signed
that night, with Lieutenant Tybee and
your father's factor for the witnesses?"
"Yes."
"Do you know what it was?"
'Control yourself." I whispered. "What
is done, is done; and the misery is not
sill yours to suffer. Tell me how I may
find tli<" rri^st. and I will do my errand
sn<] begone."
"You can not stay to find him now â
you must not." she insisted, coming out
of the fit of despair with a rebound. "He
is in the town â Indeed. I know not where
he is just now. Can you not endure it a
little longer. Captain Ireton?"
"No." said I. sullenly. "I have been
living a lie all thes* months to the friend
I love best, and I will not do it more."
Could I bÂ» mistaken? Surely there
was a flash not of anger in
the eyes that were lifted to mine,
and a tremulous note of e->erness in the
voice that said: "Then Dick does not
know? â you have not told him?"
"No; I have told no one."
"Poor Dick!" she said softly. "I
thought he knew, and I â "
Â¦ She paused, and in the pause it flashed
upon me how she had wronged my dear
lnd; how she had thought he would
make brazen love to her knowing she
was the wife of another. I t-anked God
in my heart that I had been able to
right him thus far.
After a time she said: "Why did
you make me marry you. Monsieur
John? Oh. I have racked my brain so
for the answer to that question. I know
you said it was to save my honor. But
surely we have paid a heavier penalty
th^in any that could have b<*en laid
upon me had you left me as I was."
I bowed my head to the storm. With
the dagger of my miserable errand stick
ing in my heart there was no flght In me.
"I am but come to do your bidding," I
said, slowly, for the words cost me sore
ly in the coin of anguish. "I had your
letter, and If you will say how I may
find Father Matthieuâ "
She broke me in the midst. "Mon
Dleu!" she cried. "Could I guess that
you would come here, into the very noose
of the gallows? Oh, how you do heap
scorn on scorn upon me! Once you -made
me give silent consent to a falsehood
you told; twice, nay, thrice, you have
mf.de me disloyal to the king; and now
you come again to make me look the
world in the face and tell a smiling lie
to shield you! O Holy Mother, pity me!"
And with this she rÂ»ut her face in her
hands and began to sob.
Now we were ouly measurably isolated
on the stair, and some sense of the haz
ard we took â a hazard involving her as
\v*ll as Richard and myself â steadied me
with a sudden shock.
"What folly is this, sir?" she demand
ed. "Will you never have done taking
my honor and your own life into your
reckless hands?"
the arm of another epauletted dangler.
She was before me at the meeting
-place, and there was no laughing wel
come in the deep-welled eyes. Instead.
tbÂ«y flashed at me a look that made me
wince. < -
While we were about this last. Eph
ralm Yeates came loping down the ave
nue and through the gate to vault into
the saddle of the first horse he could lay
hands on; and so it was that we three
took the northward road in the silver
starlight, with the pursuit now in order
again and in full cry behind us.
'Twas not until we had safely run the
gauntlet of the vedette lines by a by
path known to the old hunter, and had
shaken off the troopers that were follow
ing, that I found time to ask what had
become of the men who had formed the
ambush in the shrubbery.
The old man gave his dry chuckle of a
laugh.
'Twas the same old roose de geer, as
the down-country Frenchers 'u'dsay. I
stole the drunken sergeant's gun and two
others, and let 'em off one to a time. As
for the screechin', one bazoo's as good
as a dozen, If 89 be ye blow It fierce
enough."
'"Twas cut and dried beforehand.'
Dick explained. "I had an Inkling, of
what was afoot from Ephralm- here,
whom I stumbled on when I dropped
from the stair window that Madge
opened for me. He went to set his one
man ambush while I was trying to warn
you.r
"So." said I. "Our skins are whole,
but after all we have come off with
"In the name of the king!" he said;
and this was all he had time or leave to
say. For at the summons I drove my
fist against the point of his wagging
Jaw, and the recoil of the blow carried
me clear of the window seat with what
a din and 'clamor of a hue and cry to
speed the parting guest as you may fig
ure for yourselves.
The alighting ground of the leap was
the body of Dick's late antagonist lying
prone beneath the window ledge; but the
lad was up and ready to catch me when
I stumbled over the vanquished one.
" 'Tis legs for it now." he cried. "Make
for the avenue and the horses at the
hitch rail!" .
At rising twenty a man may run fast
and far; at rising forty he may still
run far if the first hundred yards do
not burst his bellows. So when we
had darted through the thin line
of encircling horsemen and were
flying down the broad avenue with
all the troopers who had caught sight of
us thundering at our heels, Dick was the
pace-setter, while I made but a shifty
second, gasping and panting and dying a
thousand deaths in the effort to catch
my second wind.
"Courage!" shouted Dick, flinging the
word back over his shoulder as he ran.
"There is help, ahead if we can live to
reach the gate!" ,
But. luckily for me, the help was near
er at hand. Half way down the box-bor
dered drive, when I was at my last gasp,
the shrill yell of the border partisans
rose from the shrubbery on the right,
and a voice that I shall know and wel
come in another world cried out: "
"Stiddy. boys, stiddy till ye can see
the whites o' their eyes! Now. then;
give it to 'em hot and heavy!"
A haphazard banging of guns followed
end the pursuit drew rein in some confu
sion, giving us time to reach the great
gate and the horse rail, and to loose and
mount the gray and the sorrel we had
marked out.
She went at that, and I made my way
slowly to the far side of the ballroom,
taking post in a deep-recessed window
giving upon the lawn. Though it was
January and Ino r.Igbt was chill and raw,
the rooms were summer warm with the
breath of the crush, and some one had
swung the casement.
Â¦\Vithout, 1 could hear the horses of the
waiting troop champfrig restlessly at
their bits, and now and agatn tiie low
gentling words of the riders. Why the
colonel did not spring his trap at once 1
could not guess; though I learned later
that he had magnified our two-man spy
ing venture into a patriot foray meant
to capture the whole houseful of British
officers at a swoop, and was taking his
measures accordingly.
'Twas while I was listening to the
champing horses that I heard uny name
whispered in the _ darkness, beyond the
open casement. I' turned slowly, and the
nearest of the soldier watchers began to
edge his way toward my window, i
â¢ " 'Tis Iâ Dick Jennifer," whispered the
voice without. "Swing the casement a
little wider and out with you. Be swift
about it, for God's sake!" .
"I am fair trapped," I whispered back.
"Make oft as you can."
"And leave you behind?" So much I
heard; and^then came sounds of a strug
gle; the breath-catchings of two men
locked In a strangler's hold, a smothered
oath or two. a fall on the turf under the
window, followed by the soft thudding
of fist blows. 1 could bear it no longer.
The edging sola'ier had come within
arm's reach, and when I swung the case
ment a little wider, he laid a hand on my
shoulder.
"Oh. '^is hard, hard!" she murmured.
I snatched the word from her lips.
"To choose between love and wifely
duty? Then I make it a command. Go,
quickly!"
She glanced over her shoulder with a
look in her eyes that made me think of a
wounded bird fluttering in the net of the
fowler.
Her shudder of loathing shook the
hand on my arm. "That man! Oh. Mon
sieur John! I fear him day and nijjht!
If I could but run away; but we are not
finding Dick â we must find him quickly!"
There was no other place to look save
in tJip entrance hall, and at the door one
of the statue-like soldiers took two steps
aside and barred the way. I faceJ aboat
and we plunged once again into tho
throng, but not before I had had a
glimpse of Richard in the hall beyond.
When the chance offered, I bent to whis
per.
"Dick is in the hall, looking for me. Go
you to him and wr.rn him. I may not
pass the door, as you have seen."
"He will not escape without you," she
demurred.
"Tell him he must. Tell him I say he
must:"
But by now my purpose was well ta
ken, and though it appeared that Richard
Jennifer was more than ever my suc
cessful rival. I pÂ»Â£dse you. my dears, i
had no thought of leaving him behind.
So we made another slow round of the
rooms, and while we , were looking for
Dick I spoke in guarded whispers to
warn my lady of Falconnet's return. But
the warning was not p^ded.
"Oh. why did you bring him here? He
will surely be taken!" Her voico was
tremulous with fear, and I answered as
I could, being sore at heart, in spite ol
all. ths.t her chief concern should be for
Richard.
Together we made the slow circuit of
the dancing room, -but Jennifer was not
to be found. Out of the tail of my eye
I saw a soldier slipping in here and
there to stand statue-like against the
wall. This brought it to a matter of
minutes, of seconds, mayhap, and still
we looked in vain for Dick.
We were standing in a deep window
bay and I drew the curtain an Inch or
two. The air without was filled with
the trampling of hoofbeats on green
sward. A ligHt-horse troop was sur
rounding- the manor house.
I drew her arm in mine and led her
back to the ballroom: 'twas now come to
this, that open publicity was our best
safeguard. "We must find Dick," said I.
"Have you seen him?'*
began to drift again, through the ball
room and so on to where the spread table
stood ringed with its groups of nlbblers.
I had made no more than half the round
of the refectory when I saw Margery
standing in the curtained arch, looking
this way and that, with anxious terror
written plainly in her face.
"What is it?" I asked, when she had
found me out, ,
'"Tis the worst that could happen,
she whispered. "You are discovered,
both of you. Colonel Tarleton was too
shrewd for us. He has let it be known
among the officers that there are two
spies in the house, and now. Hark!
what is that?"
"you knew full well what you were
promising. John Ireton!" he said. "She
Is not here."
"Nay, I did not say that. But I did
say the other; that you should have the
house and all its holdings."
We were cantering up the oak-sen
tried avenue to that door which Gilbert
Stair had once sought to keep against i&
with his bell-mouthed blunderbuss.
There was no sign of any living thing
about the place; and when we had no
answer to our sword-hilt knockings on
the door, the lad turned upon me with a
flash of anger in bis eyes and his lip a
curl.
But once at large, we put spurs to our
horses in true ritter fashion: and we had
galloped half way to Appleby House be
fore Dick said:
"Now we are well out of that, what
next? We can not go to Margery with
the whole British army at our heels."
"Nay. but we shall, if only for a short
half hour," I asserted. Then, as once
before. I gave him my best bow. "For
the last time, it may be. let me play the
lord of the manor. You are very wel
come to my father's demesne, Richard,
and to all of Its holdings."
"All?" said he, giving me a quick eye
shot as we pressed on side by side.
"Yes, all," said I; and I meant It In
good faith. He should have the lady
too; that precious holding 1 of the old
manse without whom my father's acres
would be a bauble to be lost or won In
differently.
"Then you do not love Madge more?"
he queried, his eye kindling.
How we rode free out of that hurly
burly at the ford head you must figure
for yourselves. If you can. The men of
the British vanguard were all about us
when we got to the' scrub oak thicket
and mounted, but no one of them raised
a hand to stay us. I have thought since
that mayhap they took us for a pair of
their own Tory allies who Â¦were not
above wearing the stolen uniforms of the
dead. Be that as it may. we rode away
unhindered. Dick In all the bravery of
his captain's slashngs. and I in light
horse buff and blue, taking the road
toward the manor house because that
was the only one beyond the sight and
sound of the Tictors at the ford.
The old marksman sprang up in a
fury of wrath. "Dad blast ye for a pair
of aim-sp'ilin' â "
A roar of musketry cut the rebuke in
half, and a storm of bullets smote
through the branches overhead. A fall
ing bough knocked my hat off. and 1
stooped to recover it. When I rose.
Dick was clipping the old man tightly in
his arms. Yeates' belt was cut, and a
little oozing well-spring ' of red was
slowlv soaking the fringe of his hunt
ing-shirt.
'Ease me down, Cap'n Dick; ease me
down. The old man's done for, this
time, ez I allow â spang, in the Innards.
Ease me down and get off for yerselves.
if so be ye can. im â me â Jit â **
The wagging Jaw dropped and the
keen old eyes went dim and slglitless.
Dick's oath was more a sob than an Im
precation; and now it was I who said:
"Come on â the living before the dead!"
and so we made the well-nigh hopeless
dash for the horses.
Dick saw the meaning In my look, and
together we pounced to drag the old man
out of hiding. When we burst down
upon him. Yeates had bis piece to his
face and was drawing a bead on a stout
man in cocked hat and plain regimentals
whose horse was curveting and sidling
in the nearer shallows; no less a figure.
In truth, than my Lord Comwallis him
self, cheering his men on to the attack.
We had scarce made out the old hun
ter's target when the rifle spat fire, the
curveting charger reared in its death
plunge, and the British commander-ln
chlef. unhurt, as it seemed, was dragged
from the' entanglement of his stirrups
by his aids.
But in the gathering and the retreat
our old sharpshooter under his holly
bush had: been left behind; and now we
heard him again, chanting his terrible
Imprecations on the enemy.
"Up with you and out of this!" cried
Jennifer, setting me the example. "We
must e'en gallop as we can. Quick,
ma n !'^JlgMfe<!BawfflWBW>^jgiJ" fflm
By this time the British .vanguard was
storming ashore through the shallows
below the tree fringe which served as
cover for Graham's men, and the king's
muskets, silent hitherto, began to roar
and belch by platoon and volley fire.
Jennifer craned his neck and took a
swift view of the situation.
"By the Lord Harry!" he cried, "'tis
high time Joe Graham was getting his
lads in order for a foot race. Once those
fellows come ashore they'll play hare
and hounds with us to the king's , taste.
Keep your eye on the nags. Jack. It may
chance us to do what two men can to
cover a belated retreat,"
We had tethered our horses in a thick
et of scrub oak where they would be out
of bullet reach until the enemy gained
the bank. As I looked to make sure of
them, the sorrel gave a - shrill neigh to
welcome the pounding of hoofs on the
Appleby road. I made sure this would
be General Davidson bringing in the re
serves; and so, indeed, it was; but he
came too. late. O'Hara's men were al
ready climbing the bank; and Joe Gra
ham was rallying his little company for
flight in the face of an onset that made
the tree fringe sing with musket balls.
"'Tis our cue to *run away!" Dick
shouted, dragging me to my feet. "To
the horses!"
But now w.ewere too late. .David
son's men were between us and the
scrub oak thicket, and we must wait
till the column swept byâ
Dick swore fervently and put his face
to the foe and his back to a tree. Where
upon I dragged him down as promptly as
he had Just now dragged me up. telling
him his broadsword would make but a
poor 'shift parrying musket-balls.
What followed after was over and done
with in a dozen fluttering heart beats.
Seeing the case was desperate. General
Davidson gathered Graham's fifty into
his flying column, flogged his rear' into
the retreat, and was pitched out of his
saddle by a Tory rifle bullet while he
was doing It. And when the way to our
horses was clear of the galloping Caro
linians, and we would have run. to mount
and ride - after them, the swarminjj red
coat van was upon us..
"Let be," he said, " 'tis murder, if you
like, but all war is that. When old
Eph's turn comes, they will kill him as
relentlessly as he is killing them."
My gorge rose. This picking off of of
ficers has always seemed to me the sav
agest of war's barbarities. How Richard
divined my thought and purpose, I know
not: but when I would have slipped down
to Yeates' holly bush he laid a detaining
hand on my arm.
Crack! went the long-barreled piece
again, and again an officer hallooing on
his; floundering battalion bent to his
saddlehorn and slipped Into the turbid
flood.
" 'Let them be as the children of Am
alek before the Mighty One of Israel;
make them and their princes like Oreb
and Zeeb; yea, make all their princes
like as Zebah and Zaimunna. â¢ â¢ â¢
O my God. make them like unto a wheel,
and n9 the stubble before the wind; like
ns the fire that burneth up the wood, and
as the flame that consume th the moun
tains.' "
" 'Let God arise and his inimies be
scattered. â¢ â¢ â¢ - Let them be as
chaff upon a threshing floor." â **
"The sharp crack of the old borderer's
rifle filled the momentary pause, and a
British officer in a colonel's uniform
swayed drunkenly in his saddle and
plunged headlong in the stream.
"T.was touch and go, but happily, as I
have said, the river was at hand. We
came to the high bank some hundred
yards above the fording place, and lack
ing Dick s example to shame me to the
brnvor course, I fear I should have re
coiled at the brink. But when the lad
sent his horse without the missing of a
bound far out over the eddying flood, I
shook the reins on the sorrel's neck,
gave him the word and shut my eyes.
Afte*r all. it was nothing worse than a
cold plunge, with a few pistol bullets to
spitUr harmlessly around us when we
came up for air. Moreover, there were
the campflres of Davidson's men on the
farther bank to encourage us; and so
swimming and wading by turns, we got
across in time to give the alarum.
Â¦ As you would guess, there was a
mighty stir on our side of the river when
we had splashed ashore and got our
news well born. As It turned out,' Gen
eral Davidson's main camp was a good
half-mile back from the river In one of
the outtlelds of Appleby Hundred. So it
chanced there were upon the spot only
brave Joe Graham and his fifty riflemen
to dispute the passage of an army.
What was done at Macgowan's Ford in
tne gray dawn of the morning of Febru
ary 1, 1781. has become a page In our
history. But I protest that not any of
the chroniclers do eve'n-handed justice to
the little band of patriot riflemen doing
their utmost to hold a hundred-to-one
outnumbering: host in check.
'Twas a fine sight, be the onlooker
Whig or Tory. The Guards, led by the
fiery Irishman, O'Hara.- took the water
first, the men crowding shoulder to
shoulder to brace against the sweep of
the current, which, on the western side
of the stream, was little less than a mill
tail for swiftness. After them came the
foot and horse in solid squares, and al
ways with more to follow. Ndne the less,
our little handful did not blanch; and
when the Guards in midstream â¢ held
straight across instead of bearing to the
right as the ford ran, a shout went up
on our side and the fifty hastened up
from the fordhead as one man to face
the enemy squarely.
Now it was that the brown-barreled
riflrs began to crack and spit fire; and I
do think if we had had our other two
hundred and fifty out of that back field
on the manor lands, we might at least
have made the wading redcoats hurry a
little. Indeed, as it was, the van of the
Guards broke here and there, and we
could hear O'Hara berating- his men as
only a battle-mad Irishman can. with
blarneyings and curses intermingled.
'"Having no firearms save our wetted
pistols, Jennifer and I crouched in cover,
waiting to do what two swordsmen
might - when the blade's length .should
bridge the fast-narrowing distance be
tween uh and the advancing host.
'Twas in this little Interval of forced
inaction that we heard a most fa
miliar voice issuing from a clump of
holly Just below our covert; a voice lifted
now* in fervent prayer and again in
scriptural anathema on the foe.
"Not unless they swim, horse and
foot," I objected. "'Twill be Macgow
an's. more likely." , :-â¢
Having 1 this uncertainty to resolve, we
must hang upon the skirts of the British
advance till we could make sure, and
this proved to be a most perilous busi
ness. - Yet by riding abreast of the mov
ing main we did resolve the uncertainty;
heard the orders passed from man to
man, and later saw a small feinting de
tachment split oft to take the road for
Beattie's, while the main body held on
for Macgowan's; all of this before we
were discovered in the gloaming of the
dawn by some of Tarleton's men.
Then. I promise you, my dears. It was
neck or nothing, with the devil to take
thÂ«Â» hindmost. Away we sped toward' the
near-by river, spurring our wearied
beasts as men who ride for life, with a
dozen troopers so close upon us that
Â¦when I glanced over my shoulder the
foremost of the redcoat riders was hav
ing his face well bespattered with the
mud from my horse's heels.
When we had sheered off to let this skir
mish* cloud by, Dick struck a spark Into
his tinder-box to have a sight of his
compass needle.
"South and by east," he announced;
"that- will mean. Beattie's Ford, I take

ante-dungeon to the wine cellar.
Here I thought we might be safe for
the moment, but not so my lady. Call
ing Dick to help herâ In. all the fierce
haste of it I marked that she called to
Dick and not to me â she unlocked and
opened the door to the wine vault, and
in a. trice we two and the luckless horses
were safely Jailed in pitchy darkness
with the stout oaken door slammed be
hind us. the bolt shot in the lock, and
the key withdrawn, as we could see by
the spot of light which came through
the keyhole. ' L ,
And while we sat and talked the long
day wore on to evening and a storm
came on. as we could determine,
though no otherwise than by the muffled
rolling of the thunder which, since we
could not see the lightning nor hear the
rain, we took at first for the booming of
distant cannon.
Jennifer had resumed his pacing sen
try beat, and at this juncture a most
singular thing happened. Though we
were sealed in. as I have said, from the
outer world" with no crack nor cranny
for a peephole, a blinding flash of light
ning, blue and ghastly, came suddenly to
fill the whole cellar with its vivid glare.
"Good Lord!" says Richard, clapping
his hands to his eyes; "where did that
come from?"
I was wholly at a loss for a moment.
Then I remembered that there was. or
had been in my boyhood days, a narrow,
iron-barred window in the farther end of
the wina cellar, opening beneath that
other window of the great south room
where I had climbed to spy upon the
conspirators on the night of Captain
John Stuart's visit to Appleby. So it
chanced that when another flash came I
was looking straight over Dick's head at
the place in the farther arching of the
vault where the little window should be.
The momentary glare showed me the
low square of the window opening, and
framed for a flitting instant therein a
face of most devilish malignity peering
in upon me with foxy-fierce eyes; the
face, to wit, of Gilbert Stair's lawyer
factor.
In a twinkling the vision was gone,
find In the space between the flash and
the crash there was a sound as of a
wooden shutter slamming In place. Dick
heard the noise without knowing the
cause of it, being so far 'beneath the
window as to see nothing but the light
ing of the glare.
"What was that?" he demanded, when
the thunder gave him leave.
" 'Twas our trapper clapping the shut
ter on the window over your head," said
I. "He was looking in to see if we were
ripe for hanging."
"'Tis no time for riddles; what mean
you?"
"I mean that we shall have a file of
redcoats down upon us as soon as ever
Mr. Owen Pengarvin can give the alarm."
"Oho;" said Dick; and then he pulled
his sword from its scabbard, and I could
see the battle-veins swelling in his fore
head. "They can hang me when I am too
dead to cut and thrust more â not
sooner.**
I got me up and went to find the sword
which I had laid aside in the horse-bait
ing. 'Twas a poor blade â one of our
captures at the Cowpens; and when I
tried its temper it snapped in my hand.
"Never mind." said I: "give me the
broadsword scabbard and I will play it
as a cudgel, 'tis long enough and full
heavy enough."
He laughed and clapped me on the
shoulder, swearing out his love for me
as If I had said something moving. "You
are every inch a soldier. Jack; you would
put heart into a worse craven than I am
ever like to be." And he loosed the iron
scabbard and gave it to me.
Now ensued a most painful time of
waiting and listening for the tramp of
our takers. We posted us near the door,
a little to the side, so that its inswing
might not catch us; and so. bracing for
the onset, we waited till the strain of
suspense grew' so great that we both
started like frightened children, when
finally the key was thrust into the lock
and the bolt shut back.
But when the heavy dooi; gave inward,
as at the pushing of a weak or timid
hand, we saw our dear lady standing in
t!vÂ» half gloom of the ante-dungeon,
breathless and trembling with excite
ment.
"Come!" she panted: "come quickly â
there is not an instant to spare. The
factor has betrayed you; he will be here
directly with the dragoons!".
I cut in swiftly. "He has not seen
Dick; does he know we are both here?"
She had one hand on her heart to still
its tumultuous beating, and the other
held behind her, and she could scarce
speaJi more for her eagerness to have us
out and away.
"No: It was you he saw; and my father
heard Colonel Tarleton give the order.
Lieutenant Tybee is to take a file of his
men and hang without grace the
man he will find hiding in the wine cel
lar; those were his very words. Oh,
merciful heaven! will you never stir?"
Richard gave a low whistle.
"So Tybee has come alive in good
time to square the old account with us."
he would say: but my wonder was great
er on the other head. "Your father?" I
gasped. "And he sent you to save me?"
"Surely," she said. "Are you not once
Â«gain his guest. Captain Ireton?" Then
sne stamped her foot, and though the
candle light was of the poorest, I could
see her eyes flash. "Will you squander
the last moment in silly questions?" she
burst out. "Come, I say!"
I smiled. "Give me that sword you are
hiding behind you and I will keep the
door while you sMrit Dick away. He Is
not to be in this."
She gave me the weapon, though not,
as I made sure, in any consenting to my
proposal. I could have cried out in sheer
joy when I found the sword to be my
own good blade of proof â the ancient
Ferara willed me by my father.
Sharp as the crisis was. I make no
doubt I should have asked her then and
there how she came by the blade I had
last seen when my Lord Cornwallis tried
to break it over his knee; but the march
of events suddenly became too swift for"
me. There was a sound of cautious foot
steps In the inclined passage leading
from thÂ« butler's pantry above, and our
chance for escape that way was gone.
"Too late!" said Dick; and with an arm
about Margery he whipped behind the
great oaken door opened back against
the cellar wall, whispering me to follow.
We were scarce In hiding, with the
door well drawn back to screen us. when
the cautious footsteps came slowly into
the out-cellar. Peeping through the
crack behind the door we saw Pengarvin
â alone.
What brought him there without his
tale of armed men at his back no man
will ever know; but since his ways' were
always crooked and devious, I guessed
he would not wish to appear In the mat
ter in his own proper person, and yet
could not deny himself a 'forehand peep
to see if the trap were still safe shut
and secure.
'Twas evident he was much disconcert
ed at finding the door open and the wine
vault apparently empty. At first he
would start and dodge as if to run away;
then his rage got the better of his cau
tion and he had one of those senseless
cursing fits I have told before you of.
raving and swearing and promising all
manner of fiendish recompense to Mis
tress Margery when he should have her
in his power.
A little longer dwelling upon this va
riation of the cursing theme â ravings In
which Dick learned for the first time of
the factor's design to marry my widow
and the estate â and I do think the lad
would have gone out to make him sing
another tune. But now the factor left
off suddenly to cock his ear and listen,
and afterward to come tiptoeing Into the
cellar, all eyes to spy and legs to run If
a mouse should but squeak at him. ,.
The candle . was burning brightly now^
and he crept catlike around the cask to
peer into the bin beyond it. Just then
fell open 7 with a shrill creaking of its
the shutter to the little window of espial
rusty hinges, and a blue glare of light
ning came to prick out every nook and
corner of the cellar. Being almost with
in a blade's length of* the factor, I saw
' him plainly; saw him start back and put
his hands to his face and drop down all
of a tremble on the bin's edge, where i
had been sitting wh,en he discovered me.
To second the flash of a prolonged
drum roll of thunder upon the still air
of the vault, and mingled with the thun
der came other flashes, searing the eye
and making the candle flame appear as
a sickly orange halo In the blue-white
glare. What with the play of the storm
artillery we could neither see nor hear
for the moment, but when the candle
light came to its own again the scene
had changed as if my magic. Under
cover of the thunder din a squad of
dragoons had come to ring the factor in
where he sat upon the edge of the wine
bin.
"So-ho!" said my good friend Tybee,
with a little strident laugh, "'tis you I
am to take out and hang, is it, Master
Lawyer? 1 thought mayhap you'd dou
ble on your track once too often, and so
it seems you have. Up with you and
come along."
" "Oh, 'tis all a mistake, my good sirâ a
devil's own trap! 1 â I am not the man; i
pledge you my sacred word! Iâ hands
off, you cursed villains, or I'll have the
law on you!" this last when one of the
men cast the noose of a rope over his
head while a second drew his arms to
his sides in the looping of another cord.
"By God! you shall all smart for this;
all, I say! Take me to Colonel Tarleton.
The King has no etancher friend in all
the province than I. Why, damme, 'twas
I whoâ"
A trooper came behind him and gadded
him with the loose end of the rope, and
Tybee held the candle to light the knot
ting of it. And po they marched him
out, with Tybee muttering between his
teeth that it was rat-catcher's work, and
no soldier's, this killing of vermin, 1 and
bidding his .men make haste.
CHAPTER L.
HOW RICHARD COVERDALES DEBT
WAS PAID.
For some breathless moments after we
three were left alone in the Stygian
darkness of the wine cellar no word was
spoken. The rolling of the thunder drum
was muffled now, as it were booming out
the dirge of the man who had digged a
pit and had fallen therein, and the light
ning flashes coming at longer intervals
served but to intensify the gloom they
lit up for the instant.
It was a minced oath from Richard
that first broke the spell that bound us.
" 'Twas too much for Madge," said he,
"she has fainted. Swing the door and
light another candle."
I did both as quickly as might be, and
we bedded her on the floor, stripping our
coats to soften the stone flagging for her
and trying by all the- means known to
two unskilled soldier leeches to bring
her to.
â¢â¢Water!" said Dick, but when we had
laved her face with that and with wine
as well, without effect, we were all dis
mayed, I do assure you. For all our
efforts she lay as one dead, and neither
of us could be cold enough to pry her
lips apart to play the drenching doctor
with the wine.
"i^oru: " cued Dick, the sweat standing
out upon his face in great drops; "this
is terrible! What shall we do?"
"Jeanne will know what to do," I as
serted. "We must get her out of this
and up to her chamber."
Richard started to his feet and stopped
to gather the dear body of her in' his
arms. But in the act he paused and
straightened himself to look fixedly at
me.
"Do you take her, Jack; she Isâ she isâ
your wife."
"Nay. ' said I. drawing back. "You
arc her own true lover, and could she
choose her bearerâ*'
"A murrain on your finickings!" he
burst out. "She may die while we nro
haggling over the right to help her.
Take her up quick, man, and begone!"
"But bethink you, Dick," I urged, "if
you are taken, you have one chance In
ten of faring as an officer and a prisoner,
of war. For me 'tis a spy's death as
swift as they can drag tine to It."
Now you will know, my dears, how
much I loved these two when I could
twist a cord of such mean fiber to bind
them closer together. Richard's eyes
flashed and his Up curled.
"Overlook It in me, if you can," he
said, with fine scorn. "I had not thought
upon the peril of it." And with that he
took her In his arms as she had
been a child to be carried and I swuntr
the door for him. But on the threshold
he gave me back my sorry little sub
terfuge. "Once more, your forgiveness.
Jack. I knew well you were but lying
to give me precedence. Can you trust
me with her?" -
"Aye, dear lad; now and ever, said I;
and so I pushed him out and closed the.
door. .
I made shift to lead the horses
through the narrow passage and out
by a rear door, giving them a friendly
slap to point them toward the stables.
I know not how long it was ti.at I
paced a weary sentry beat up and
down the narrow limits of the wine
cellar, alone with such thoughts as go
to make the sum of that despair which
follows hard upon the heels of some
climaxing catastrophe. But I do know
that, as the hours dragged on leaden
shod, a slow fever of impatience came
to dry the blood in my veins; .o make
me hunger and thirst for leave to say
the final word to Father Matthieu, and
so to be set at liberty to find the bot
tom of the pit into which a mocking
fate had plunged me.
Since I had led forth the good horses
the great oaken door had stood ajar.
So I wondered why my visitor made
so much ado rattling the key in the
lock. Then it came to me suddenly that
the noise and delay were meant to
give me timely warning; - and at the
scent of threatening peril â a - peril I
might cope with and grapple soldierwise
â I became a man again. A sweep of
my hat sent the sputtering candle flying
from its barrel head to the farther corner
of the vault and I dropped quickly be
hind :* row of empty wine-butts to await
what should befall.
Had she been a ghost. Mistress Mar
gery would scarce have startled me more
when she swung the door to let me see
her. She was gowned In her best; there
was a heightened color in her cheek;
her eyes were like stars. Truly, I do
think I never saw her so beautiful as
she appeared at that moment, standing
under the massive arch of the doorway
with her candle held high to light the
inner gloom.
"This way, Scipio," she said, trip
ping ahead of the mulatto to point out
the Madeira bin. 'We shall give my
lord and his gentlemen the best the
Appleby cellar holds to speed their
parting." Wherewith she stood aside
to wait while he filled his basket with
the straw-cased bottles. /
At this I saw why she had come.
Lord Cornwallis and his gejitlemen were
about to take the road and the wine
was wanted for the stirrup cup. Trust
ing my fate to -no hand less loyal than
her own, she had come herself with
Scipio to stand betwixt me and possible
discovery. And her word to the serv
ing man was also a word to me to let
me know my prisonment was near an
end.
I thought It a most generous thing
in her; the last of all her many wifely
loyalties; and I would have given much
for leave to stand forth and tell her
so. .Indeed, when the mulatto had
poised his basket upon his head and
vanished, and she was lingering to take
a last look around before she followed
him. I was upon the point of speaking.
But while I hesitated I saw her
start back with a little cry of terror.
Standing In the arched doorway through
which the mulatto had now passed was
a man cloaked, hatted, booted and spur
red as for the road. At her cry he
doffed his hat and ... >
My dears, I shall never be â¢ able to
draw for you the hideous 'death-mask
the man was wearing for a face. Seamed
and scarred, shriveled and livid in pur
ple and crimson welts, you would think
a nine-thronged whip of- fire had
scourgred out every semblance of come
liness, leaving only the skeleton frame
on which to hang this ghastly carica
ture of a human face. Fearing him not
at all, I could scarce forbear a shudder
at the sight of this walking death-mask
of the libertine, Sir Francis Falconnet:
And if his face were terrifying- in re
pose, 'twas fair . demoniac when he
laughed.
"Ha!" he said, ', bowing again in the
mockery, of politeness, "You are sur
prised, Mistress Margery; you heard
my lord's order and. thought I would
be now some miles on the road to Sal
isbury?"
"If you were the loyal soldier you
should be, sir." she said, drawing her
self up proudly, "you would be at the
head of your troop, as his Lordship di
rected." And then, with a gesture that
was most queenly: "Stand aside, Sir â
Libertine, and let me, pass."
His answer was another mocking
laugh, and he ' stepped within to close
the door and lock it. When he turned
to front her again his face was the face
of a tormented devil.
"By God! you think too lightly of me.
Mistress Margery. Before ever this day
dawned I owed you much, but like a
spiteful little hellicat you must needs add
to the score by making me a target for
your wit at the supper table. 'Twill cost
a life to more than one of them who
laughed with you, my lady, .but 'twill
cost you dearer still."
He came nearer as he spoke, thrusting
that horrible face farther into the circle
of candle light, but she would not draw
back nor flinch a hair, and I marked
that the hand that held the candlestick
was as steady as a rock. - But when he
made an end she flung a quick glance
over her shoulder and my heart leaped
for Joy. For then I knew she was lean
ing upon me.
"Once more. Captain Falconnet, will
you let me pass?" she said.
"No!" he snarled, adding a horrid
blasphemy. 'VTwas passion in me once,
and I am none so sure there was not a
time when you could have cooled it into
love. But now 'tis hatred and revenge."
He snapped his fingers In her face. "The
thing tney'll find. here in- the morningâ "
He fell face downward at her feet and
I sÂ«t my heel in the small of his back
to hold him while I could drive the point
of the Ferara between his ribs. But my
dear lady would not have it so.
"No, no! for the love of heaven, not
that, Monsieur John!" she cried, and for
the moment her fine, courage was all
swallowed up of pity and she became a
compassionate woman pleading for a
life.
But now my blood was up. "You are
my wife," I said, coldly. "If he had a
dozen lives I should take them all for
that which he said to you."
â¢ "But not that way â oh, not that way,
I do beseech you!" she beggea. "Think
of what it will mean to youâ andâ to me.
For your own sake. Monsieur John."
I took my heel from the man's back.
"Your wish is law to me, dear lady.
But your way Is clear now; you may
go." : , Â¦ v .
She took a step toward the door.
"You will not kill him when I am
gone. Monsieur John?"
"By the name he bears he was doubt
less born a gentleman; since you wish it
he shall die like one."
I paw she did not take my meaning;
that when she was gone I should let
him have his chance to die sword in
hand.
"Remember, I have your promise," she
said, turning to go. "The army is on the
march for Salisbury, and in a little whiie
your friends will be here toâ"
The sentence ended in a. very womanly
I cannot tell you what was in the
words to make me hot with anger, as I
had but now been hot with love. But
the new wound in my shoulder was
bleeding freely, and I would not let her
see I was hurt; and if aught, will
stanch a wound 'tis anger.
"You need not say so much." I retorted,
bowing low. "You have . spoken now
and then of certain duties binding upon
those who are knotted up. ever so loose
ly, in the marriage bond; I have my
part in these as well as you, Mistress
Margery."
She b'it her lip and was upon the
&dge of tears. I saw what I had done
and would curse the masterless tongue
that must needs add its word-thong to
the night's whip of scourgings.
When she spoke again it was to say:
"This is your own house, Captain Ire
ton; what will you do?"
"One question first, Is Richard Jenni
fer safe?"
"He is."
"Then, by your good leave, I shall do
what I came to do."
She bent her head in acquiescence.
"You will find the â person whom you
wish to see In your old room In the
north gable. Shall I have Anthony
light you up?"
"No; 1 can find the way."
My hand was on the stair rail when
the cruel irony of it struck me like a
olow. She had planned the loosing of
the bond in the very room where she
had knelt to take the good father's bless
ing upon it.
I stepped back, stumbled, I should
say, for a curious weakness had come
upon me, and drew her arm in mine.
"We will go together, if you please,
my lady. 'Tis only just to me that you
should hear what I must say to Father
Matthieu."
And so. dear heart! she bore with
me to the last; and together we climbed
the stair to come into the upper cor
ridor with the room of destiny at its
farther end. .
We came as far as the door; I mind
it perfectly, for I remember marking
that the wooden bar my father had put
upon it was gone, and the iron brackets
as well. But while I was groping for
the latch there came a taste of blood
in my mouth, and I heard my dear
lady's voice as if she were calling to
me across the eternal abysses. "Mon
sieur John! â you are hurt!" And then
from a still remoter distance: "Oh,
Father Matthieu â Dick! Come quickly!
He is dying!"
CHAPTER LI.
IN WHICH THE GOOD CAUSE GAINS
A CONVERT.
"You have teen terribly near to death.
Monsieur John: so near that Docto. Ca
row has twice given you over."
"No." said I: 'there was no fear of
that. I nin like that man In the old Ger
man folk uilo who made a compact witri
the Evil One, selling thereby his chanc?
to die. Death would not take me as a
gift. Mistress Margery; I have tried him
too oftt-n."
"Hush!" she said; "'tis an ill thing to
jest about. Why should you want to
die?"
"Rather ask why I should choose to
live. But this Is beside the mark. You
should have let me die, dear lady; but
since you did not, we must e'en make the
best of it."
She faced me with a smile that strug
gled with some deeper feeling of the
heart: I knew not what.
"â¢'Tis a monstrous auleful alternative,
n'est-ce pas? And I must not let you
talk at all â 'tis Doctor Carew's order."
So saying, she smoothed the c'ounter-
say, and I'm fain to hope we've seen the
last o' him, and his reaving redcoats in
these parts."
His words set me in a muse. I could
never make out what he would be at,
telling me all this. But he had an ob
ject, weli-detined, and presently it saowed
its head.
"Ye're the laird o' the manor now. Cap
tain Ireton, with none to gainsay ye,'
he went on. "So I've come to give ye an
account o-' my stewardship. I made no
doubt, all along, ye'd come back to your
own when ye'd had your fling wi' the Old
noddies, and so I've kept tab o' the poor
bit land for ye."
"Oh, you have?" said I, being so far
out-brazened as to be incapable of saying
more.
J "I have thatâ every plack and bawDee.
T.s ten years come Michaelmas since 1
took over the charge o' Appleby Hun
dred, and I'm ready to account to ye for
eve-ry season's cropâ when ye'll pay down
the bit steward's fee."
"Truly." said I, "you are an honest
man. Mr. Stair." Then, to humor him
to the top of his bent: "Haphazarding a
guess, now, would this accounting leave
a balance in my favor or in yours?"
He gave me a look like that of a cos
termonger weighing and measuring the
gullibility of his customer.
"Oh, aye, I'm no saying there might
n t be a bit siller coming to me; a tew
hundred pounds, more or less â sterling,
man. sterling; not Scots," he added has
tily. And then as if it were best to leave
this nail as it was driven, . he changed
the subject abruptly. "I've brought ye
that last will and testament ye signed,"
handing me the parchment. "No doubt
you'll let it stand, but when the bairns
come ye'll want to be adding a codicil
or two."
Leaving the matter of the estate, 1
thought it high time to cut to the mar
row of the bigger bone. So I said: "Let
us be frank with each other in this, Mr.
Stair. How much has your daughter told
you of the matter between us?" \
"She's a jade!" he rasped, lasplng for a
moment into his real self. But he recov
ered his self-control Instantly. "Ye'd no
expect a romantic bit lassie wi' French
blood in her veins to be confldencing wi'
her old dried-up wisp of a father, now
would ye? She's no tell't me everything,
I daresay."
"Then I will tell you the plain truth
of It," I said. "This marriage was never
anything more than the form we agreed
It should be at the time; a makeshift to
serve a purpose. If you think I would
hold you daughter to itâ"
"Hut, tut. man! what will ye be haver
ing about! Ye'll never cast the poor bit
lassie off that way! Ye canna, if ye
would; her church will have a word to
say to that."
For all his aping the manner of the
ignored father, I shrewdly suspected that
he knew more about the ins and outs of
our affair than he owned to.'- Neverthe
less, I was forced to meet him on his
own ground. /
"There is no 'casting off' about it, Mr.
Stair, and as to the church, tnere is good
ground for an appeal to Rome. The
marriage as it stands is little more than
a formal betrothal, as you well know,
soundly enough legally to make Mistress
Margery my heir-at-law, mayhap, but
still lacking everything ofâ *â¢
He could not wait to let me finish.
"Lacking d'ye say?" he rapped out,
wrathfully. "And whose fault is that,
ye cold-blooded stick? Tell me this; did
I no bundle ye neck and heels into your
own wire's bedroom? And how do you
thank me? I'm to suppose ye quarrel
wi' her like the dour-faced imp o' Sawtan
that ye are, and presently ye come rag
ing out, swearing most shamefully at a
man old enough to be your father!"
"Not once?"
"No. not once. Three times you havt>
done what the lovingest wife could do
to save a husband's life; and I do
greatly suspect there was a fourth and
earlier time. Tell me. little one. was
it not you who sent the Indian to Cap
fain Forney to tell him a natriot spy
was to be executed at day dawn In the
oak glade?"
She did not answer me direct.
" 'Twas I who brought you to that
pass," she said, speaking soft and low.
"But for my riding down upon you one
other morning in that same oak glade
you would not have had Sir Francis
Falconnet's sword in your shoulder. And
but for that sword wound nothing that
followed would have followed."
Saying this she fell silent for a space,
and when she spoke again she was be
come by some subtle transmutation my
trusting little maid or the bygone hal
cyon time.
"Do you remember how you used to
make a comrade of me in the old days.
Monsieur John, telling me things my
elder brother might have told me. had
I had one?"
I said I remembered; that I was not
likely to forget.
"Are you strong enough to stand In
that elder brother's place again to
night?"
"Try me and see. dear lady." .
. "Not while you say 'dear lady.' " she
pouted. " 'Twas 'Margery* and 'Mon
sieur John' a year agone."
"Have it as you will: I will even
call you "Madge" if it pleases you bet
ter."
"No," she said; "that is Dick's name
for me; and â and it Is of Dick that
I would speak. You love him well, do
you not. Monsieur John?"
I said I could never make her. or
any other woman, fully understand the
bond there was between us.
"Truly?" There was the merest flavor
of playful sarcasm In the uptilt of the
word, but it was gone when she went
on.
"Being, so good a friend to Dick, then,
you can advice me better. Tell me. If
you please, must I marry him â when â "
"Â¦\Vhen you are free to do it?" I fin
ished for her. "Why should you not, my
dear?"
She was pulling the threads from the
lace edging of her kerchief and would
not for a king's ransom let her eyes meet
mine.
"You used to say â in that other time â
that love stiould go before a marriage;
did you not? Or do I remember badly?"
"You remember well. I said it then,
and I say it again at this present. But
Dick loves you well and truly, sweet
heart; and you â "
She looked up quickly with the little
laugh that used to remind me of happy
children at play.
"And I? â now you will read a wo
man's heart for me, Monsieur John.
Tell me; do I love him as his mistress
should?"
"Nay, surely," said I, gravely, for
somehow her laugh Jarred upon "me,
"surely that is for you to say. But you
have said it. long since."
"Have I?" she queried, with an arch
lifting of the penciled brows that came
straight from her French mother. "May
hap you overheard me say it. Monsieur
Eavesdropper?"
"God help me, little one â so I did,"
said I.
All in a flash her laughing mood was
gone and she stood before me like an ac
cusing goddess.
"You told me once the past was like a
dream to you; you must have dreamed
that part of it, sir. And yet you said a
snrieK or terror, waicning ni3 cnance,
my dastard enemy had bounced to his
feet' to make a quick lunge, not at me,
but at her.
Of course I came between to parry the
murderous thrust, and after that It was
life for one of us and death for the
other. I looked to see my lady
run, shrieking; indeed, I called to her to
go, but she stood fast as if her terror
had frozen her, and it was her candle
that lighted the grim vault for the duel. â¢
As you will know full well. I was not
minded to give this thrice-accursed Mend
more than the gentleman's chance I had
promised to give him. . But now, as
twice before, he fought most desperately,
trying by every trick of fence to come
between me and the silent little figure
holding the candle aloft. As I have often
said, he was a pretty swordsman, â¢ and
at this crisis, with life at stake, and all
the fury of the seven devils ' of . disap
pointed vengeance to nerve his arm, his
sword play was most masterly.
Yet twice in his stamping rushes 1
found my onenine::once the Ferara's point
pane and straightened my pillows; and
after giving me a great spoonful of son:-s
cordial that first set a pleasant glow
alight in me and afterward made- me
drowsy, she took post again in the hol
low of the big chair and was so sitting
when I fell asleep.
This day's awakening was the first of
many so nearly of a piece that I lost the
count of Jhetn; and sleep, deep and
dreamless' for the better part, stole away
the hours -till the memory of that inch
by-inch return to health and strength Is
Itself like the memory of of the vaguest
of dreams.
By times when I awoke it was the
bluff Doctor Carew bending over me to
dress my wound; at other times it was
Margery come to tempt me with a bowl
of broth or some other kickshaw from
the kitchen. Now and again I awoke to
find Scipio or old Anthony i standing
watch at my bedside; and once â but that
was after I was up and in my clothes
and able to sit and drowse in the great
chair â I opened my eyes to find that my
"Twas far enough in the retrospect now
so that I could smile at it. Yet I would
not suffer him to bluster me aside.
"It was an ill thing for you to do, none
the less, Mr. Stair; the more so as you
must have known that Mistress Mar
gery'3 faith was plighted to Richard
Jennifer long before all thi3 came to
pass."
"Did I know it?* he shrilled. "That
lang-legged jackanapes of a Dickie Jen
nifer? Light o' love! Jade that she is,
she never cared the snap of a finger for
him."
"You are talking far enough beside the
mark now," I retorted. "Your daughter
loves Richard Jennifer well and truly,
and with this entanglement brushed aside
she will marry him when he comes back
from the wars."
. "She will, ye say? And what' will be
come o' the braw acres of Appleby that
gait, I'd like to know? But ye're daft,
man, clean daft. Didn't I spier her giv

night when he rode away after they had

"The time and circumstance were their
own best excuse. Sure I am far from
blaming you. my dear. But let it pass,
'tis enough that I know you love him as
he loves you."
Again her mood changed in the twink
ling of an eye. She sank down upon the
hassock, laughing merrily.
"O wise Monsieur John! how well you
read a woman's heart! 'Tis you should
be the lover instead of Dick. He rides
a-courting as he would a legion on a
battle field. But nothing would ever
tempt you to be so masterful rough,
would It. Monsieur John? You would
look deep into your sweetheart's eyes
and say â Tell me what you would say,
mon ami?"
A*h. my dears, I hope no one of you

then. I forgot my dear lad, forgot
honor, forgot everything save that I had

guard of the German longsword that
stopped it when his parry failed the steel
would have passed through him. After
this he grew warier, having in mind, as
I supposed, that my wrist and awn could
outweary his. Yet his' savage onset never
flagged for an instant, and when the light
fell upon his hideous face I could see the
fierce eyes glinting like a basilisk's, with
no sign In them that my time was come
to press him home.
None the less, I did press him, Inch
by inch, driving him at each new clasn
of the steel a little deeper into the gloom
that crowded close udoq the narrow cir
cle of candle light. He saw my object â
to push him to unfamiliar ground where
he might trip and stumble in the dark
nessâand he strove furiously to defeat
it. Yet he had no choice, and presently
I had him among the empty winebutts.

pouring out such blasphemies as would
make your blood run cold.
Here the end came quickly. Being en

ently it chanced that he caught his point
in the chine of a cask and his blade
snapped short at the hilt. With a veil
ing oath, hissing hot from the devil's
thumb-book, . he snatched up the broken
blade to fling and stick it javelin-wise in
my shoulder, and then I saw the dull
gleam of the candle light on the barrel
of a pistol.
Had he aimed the pistol at me I trust
I should still have given him his gentle
man's chance. But when I saw him level
the weapon at my dear lady â¢ â¢ â¢
they came In one and the same heart
beat; the sword thrust that found his
life and took it, the crash of the pistol
shot echoing like a clap of thunder in the
close vault, and pitchy darkness to draw
its curtain over all.
I know not how I reached ner, pulling
the broken sword blade from my shoul
der as I ran. nor can I tell you how. an
upgushing spring of thankfulness choked
me when I found her unharmed by the
bullet which had snuffed the candle out.
She was in a most piteous state, now
it was - all over, and though . I charged
it all where I supposed it should belong
âto the account of a natural womanly
passion to cling to something in her mo
ment of weakness â yet the blood ran
quick in my veins when she suffered me
to lead her out of that dismal, smoking
death pit, she clinging to me the while
so close that I could feel the warmth
of her and the fluttering of her, dear
heart beneath my hand. : - Â¦ Â¦
She said no word, nor did I, till we
were come above stairs. We found the
rooms on the main floor deserted by all
save , the blacks, who were clearing
away, the debris of. the feast of leave
taking. In the hall wo came upon old
Anthony, . putting on thechain of the
outer door. Here my lady drew apart

once before, behind a lighted candle at
the little table with a parchment spread
out under his bony hands. He was mum

I looked, but at my stirring he gave over

thin legs and match his long fingers by
the ends, and wink and blink at me as

he was not alone. * .
"I give- ye good even. Captain Ireton,"

I said I had. and thanked him. once for

see me. I know not how it. was, but If
there had been rancor In my former
thoughts of him. 'twas something abated
now.
"Ye've had a nearhand escape this
time, sir," he said, after a longish pause.
"One more or less of a good many
since we were last met togetherin this
room, Mr. Stair," I would say.
He muttered something to himseK
about the devil taking precious good care
of his own, and I laughed.
"That Is as it may be, but" my being
here this second time a pensioner on
your bounty is by no good will of mine,
I do assure you, sir."
Ife sat nodding at me as if I had said
a thing to be most heartily agreed 10.
But his spoken word belied the nods.
"The ways of Providence are inscrut
able â something Inscrutable. Captain Ire
ton. I make no doubt ye are sufficiently
thankfu' for all your mercies."
"Why, as to that, there may be two
ways of looking at It. As a soldier, i
may justly repine at a fate which ties
me here when I should be in the Held."
"Well said, sir; bravely said; 'tis the
part of a good soldier to be aye wanting
to be in the thick o' the fighting. But
now that ye' re a man of substance, Cap
tain Ireton, ye will be owing other debts
to our country than the one ye can pay
with a handle o' steel."
"'Our. country.' did you say, Mr.
Stair?" I ' asked, feigning a surprise
which no one knowing him could feel in
very truth.
"And what for no? 'Tis the blrthland
of someâ yourself .- for example, and the
leal land of adoption for othersâ your,
humble servant/ to wit. I've taken the
solemn oath of allegiance to the Con- .
gress, I'd have ye to know."
At this I must needs laugh outright.
"Have you taken it one more, time than
you have forsworn it. Mr. Stair?" .
"Laugh and ye will," he said, quite
placably; "ye shall never laugh the peet
riotlsm out o' me.' 'Tis little enough an
old'man can do, but. the precious cause
o' liberty will never have to ask that lit
tle twice. Captain Ireton."
Since he would ever be on the winning
side,- this foreshadowed good tidings, in
deed. So I would ask him straight what
news there was. - â¢ <
"Have they not told ye? 'Tis braw
news," he chuckled. .: "While ye were on

broke out upon me in such a blast of
cursing as I hope never to hear from the
lips of .such an old man again.
"Ye cold-blooded, crusty deevil!" he
quavered, when all his breath was spent
upon the bigger malisons. "Has It never
come intil your thick numskull that the
poor fule lassie is sick wi' love for ye, ye
dour-faced loon?"
And with that he let himself out and
slammed the door behind him, and I
heard him go pottering down the corri
dor, still cursing me by all the choice
phrases he could lay tongue to.
CHAPTER LII.
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE JOUR
NEY'S END.
I was pondering thoughtfully on this,
giving the. pinching old man credit for
any- and every motive save that which
he had so curslngly avowed, to wit. the
furthering of his daughter's happiness,
when there came . a tap at the door
and Mistress Margery entered.
.. "Dear heart! Do they limit you to
a single candle .when my back is
turned?" she said, in mock pity; and
saying it. went to light the candles In
the mantel sconces.
The sight of her standing a-tlptoe
to touch off the candles on the chimney
breast set the old love ppHl to make
my heart beat faster. What if there
were a hint of truth in Gilbert Stair's
wrathful protest. What if. after all, she
cared less for Richard and more for
me?
Do not. I pray you. my dears, think
too hardly of the man who thus lays
bare the secret thoughts of his heart for
you. â¢Twas but a passing gust of the
tempest of disloyalty, and I was not
swept wholly from my moorings.' Nay
when she came to sit on the hassock at
my feet, as she used to do In that other
halcyon-time of convalencence, I was
myself again and could look upon .her
sweet face with eyes tna: saw beyond
her to the camp or battle-field where
my dear lad was spending himself
< For a time we sat in silence, and
'twas she who spoke first.
"My father has been with you." she
said. "I hope you did not quarrel with
him."
"No," I denied, salving my conscience
with the remembering that it takes two
to make a quarrel: and that I had done
none of the cursing. "He came to give
me this," I added- handing her the will.
She opened the folded parchment,
reading a line of It here and there soft
ly to herself.
â¢â¢â¢.â" 'Being of sound mind, doth bÂ«Â»
oueath and devis* to his loving wife,
Margery â ' Ah. had you been writing
it you would not have written it so,
would you. Monsieur John?"
' ."'Tis but a form," I would say. "All
wives are 'loving* In lawyers' speech."
She smiled at mo so like an innocent
and fearless child that for the moment
I ..could Â¦ figure, her , no otherwise. Yet
her rejoinder. was a woman's.
"I say you would, not have written
it so; is not that the truthr*
I would not let h*r pin me down.
"If I should write it now it should
be written in great letters, dear lady.

ner 10 me enu. oo lor a moment I nuns
trembling on the brink; and then she
pushed me over. '
"Is this how you would do. Monsieur â
Monsieur Ogre? â sit stock still and
glower at the poor thing as if you were
between two minds as to loving her or
eating her?"
I bent quickly, took her face between
my hands and kissed her twice â thrice.
"That is what I should do. Now that
you have made me what I wa3 not be
fore, are you satisfied?"
Twas long before she gave me a word.
And when she spoke it was only to say:
"Are you not monstrous ashamed, Mon
sieur John?"
"No!" said I. "I am but a man, and
you have roused that part of me that
knows neither shame nor remorse. I love
you, Mir* tress Margery; do you hear? I
have loved you since that day in June
when I came back from death's door to
find you sitting here to bear me com
pany."
She locked her fingers across her knee
and would not look at me.
"But by your own showing you should
be ashamed, sir," she insisted. "What of
the dear friend to whom you would give
up even the love of your mistress?"
"You may flay me as you will: I shall
neither flinch nor go back from my word.
You are mine, and I shall give you up to
no man. I know I have not your love
shall never have it. Also. I know that I
have gained an enemy where once I had
a loving friend. Richard Jennifer may
kill me If he Dleaseâ he shall have the
chance to do It. but you are mine and
shall be while I live to claim and hold
you."
There was something less than anger in
the blue-gray eyes when she let me see
them: nay. I could have sworn there was
a flash of playful mockery in them when
she said: "Dear heart! how masterful
rough you have grown, all In a moment,
my lord." And then the beautiful eyes
filled and she said, "Poor Dick!" in a
way to make me suffer all the torments
of that old myth-king who could never
quaff the water that was ever rising to
his lips.
"Aye, you may love him. If you must
and will." I gloomed. "God pity me! I

ON BEGGING LETTERS
SFGOING letters ar* a dreary
waste, sometimes of Imposture,
sometimes of shiftlessnesss and
occasionally, though not often,
of genuine neÂ«d and undeserved misery,
but this province has also a charming
oasis. There is the man whose father

has followed your career (a very mod

highest pride, ever since those morning
daj-s, has often thought of writing to

of coming to take you by the hand Just
for the sake of days of Auld Lang Syne,
but has been hindered by that spirit of
diffidence and excessive modesty which
and the public seems to be under the im
pression that the author has a limited
edition of," say, 500 volumes placed at
his disposal for gratuitous circulation.
This, I may say. is a mistake, and the
public might be interested to know that
when an author sends a book In re
sponse to a begging petition, whether
from an Individual or for a bazaar,. he
has to buy it at the bookseller's and
pay exactly the same price as other peo

heard so much of my poor book, and
had feU that it would do so much for
him, that he was now doing what he
had never done before in his lifeâask
ing for a giftâ and he concluded with
these beautiful worda: "Should you in
cline your ear and send me your book,
it will be to me as bread to a starving
Indian and as water to a thirsty Arab"
â which pathetic * appeal touched I me
very deeply. One thing puzzled me
about the letter, and that was the ref
erence both to thVbook and' myself,. for
the quality in the book ' which had so
excited the" hunger and . thirst . of Â¦: my
correspondent was itÂ«: rare. devotional
character, and the quality in myself
which had won his admiration was my
spirit of mysticism. As the' only book
I could think of was supposed by cour

my mind was wonderfully cleared next

your correspondent, who, now in a busi
ness difficulty, casts himself upon his
fellow-townsman's aid and indicates
that the aid desired should be Â£100.
This, again, is to be a loan, and payable
within twenty-one days exactly. ,
There Is still another man, who has
got into debt through no fault whatever
of his own, and whom an unfeeling
creditor Is treating in a very inconsid
erate manner, and who, when cast down
in spirit, came across a tale written by
you co charged with simplicity of
thought and tenderness of heart that it
seemed a guidance of providence. There,
he said to himself, is the helper I need,
and ready for the occasion. And the
Â¦writer states respectfully but firmly the
amount which is needed, and his con
viction that no true man who could
write as you have done would refuse to'
send the amount without delay.
One of the most charming treasures of
my limited experience I owed to a mis
take (rare, I should suppose) on the
part of my correspondent. He was, he
stated, and I am afraid the statement
was correct, a minister of religion (but
of what body, and ;r> what place, al
though all that appeared in the letter,
are locked in my breast), and Le asked
on grounds of poverty for the gift of a
book. It is not unusual for persons to
write to an author for one of his books.
r-r*HE first act of a new-born babe
I Is that of crying. Â« it does not
. cry it is generally plunged into
1 cold water, or In some other way
made uncomfortable, that it may be
made to cry. Those who have studied
ihe physiology of the baby most close
ly assert that there are very good rea
sons for this method of treatment. If
a young child cries it 1 is because it Is
not comfortable. It Is for this sin that
he !Â» so often shaken, smacked or
rocked until he is sick. If he was old
enough he might be glad to please
everybody and keep quiet and be good.
We should not -forget that no young
child cries unless It has very good rea
son for so doing.
The . action of many parents tend
to- convince the thoughtful observer
that many parents think there Is no
tense In a child's crying ,ai any time,
unless, as a result of very considerable
injury. Are they not wrong? Can
every one not remember certain occa
sions In their own experience when a
good cry has greatly relieved them?
For some reason does It not seem to
clear the oppressive moral atmosphere,
Just as a thunder-storm purifies the
air? \lf for this purpose it is at all
necessary for the adult. It Is certainly
many times -more important for the
young child. 'â¢-.'who is so /emotional, so
susceptible to every change. If the
young child cries. It Is likely that, as
before stated, he is too hot or too cold,
or hungry, â¢ or. uncomfortable In some
"other way. - Why should any one object
to the expression of his discomfort and
displeasure?:^ Is there any other -way
he could" call for assistance ? In place
of belngtroubled to know how to quiet
a child," would 'it â¢not be more sensible
to, find the cause of discomfort?
To a certain extent, what has been
said -'of -.the young child applies to the
older, child. â¢ It should also be remem
bered that chlldren'of certain tempera
ments cry much' easier, than do those
of. other temperaments. In" some the
'tears seem to lie , very near.: the sur
face: They are r so emotional, or so ner
vous; 7that,\ without; great "effort, '- they
are, unable to control; their: feelings or
repress' their fear. Such -should 'be
dealt with â¢ gently. Generally they;
come i by, It so honestly that - the same
peculiarity can :be remembered as hav
ing --appeared in one of the parents.
By kindness they may be trained to
have much more control over their
emotions. However, It is hard to en
tirely overcome this natural tendency,
as these children so frequently feel In
tensely.
Some children, both young and older,
cry simply for the purpose of carrying
their point. Such require entirely dif
ferent treatment from that already
mentioned. If a -child cries without
.sufficient provocation, it is likely the
fault of the improper training he has
received. It Is entirely unnatural for
a child to yell and squeal as some chil
dren do. In some cases they have not
been treated as they should have been,
or they would probably respond In
milder tones. The child who cries per
sistently and loudly, though not suffer
ing pain, does so because his past ex
perience leads him .to believe that he
will be successful In securing what he
wishes. If such a child should pass
under the control of one to whom such
methods do not appeal, he would cure
himself of his fault very quickly.
The parent who wishes to stop a
child's crying should first make sure
that the child Is not suffering some
mental or physical pain. In too many
cases, the mental suffering of a child
Is far greater than parents think. Hav
ing removed the cause of the pain,
crying should cease. If, after having
used all gentle means which can be
commended, the crying does not cease,
it may. be necessary to convince the
child who cries for nothing that it Is
really unpleasant to have something
to cry for. Nothing but corporal pun
ishment will appeal to some children.
at such a time. When the child finds
that some punishment is certain every
time he cries without having some
good. reason for crying, a wonderful
transformation will be worked In nine
out of ten such children.
The child who persists in crying for
6omething very much desired may be
cured, very easily of such a habit. If
the child Is made to understand that
the parent cannot and will not give
anything for which it cries. It will be
found that the child will '"cease crying
for- .what -It '.wishes and ask for it as it
should;
Most children tease, more or less.
Yet there are some children who > do
not tease. Why is it that some tease
their parents, while others do not? Ob
serve closely and you will notice that,
when the parent, asked for some favor,
Many parents yield to teasing be
cause they are tired out by the ever
lasting nagging, which is certainly un
pleasant and racks the nerves.
"Think twice before speaking" may
be a good, rule for children. Might not
the Injunction to "think several time*
before refusing or granting a child's re
quest" be Just' as good for parents?
From what has been said. It win be
seen that parents train children to
tease by not having them understand
that they mean what they say. The
Injunction for parents on this subject
is, "Let not your aye mean no. nor
your no mean aye." If children could
be questioned and led to tell what they
really think about this matter, many
would testify that they fully expect
to have to tease for what they are
determined to have. They learn to cal
culate the time most favorable and
the energy which will be needed to car
ry their points.
Who ever heard of a child's teasing
at the table for a glass of water, or
for a piece of bread, or for anything
else that was not out of the ordinary?
He expects to tease only for that which
he very well knows It may not be best
for him to have. It is the second piece
of pie, another knife, or sled, or for
permission to sit up later than usual,
or to remain home from school, for
some insufficient reason.
The parent who. In a kind but firm
tone, promptly either grants or refuses
the request, is not likely to be teased.
If, upon refusal, the request is re
peated, and such a parent denies with
no less kindness, but with somewhat of
firmness, he Is not apt to be bothered
by having the request repeated fre
quently. Indeed, It may bÂ© said that
the parent who meets the request in
this manner, at all times, will never
be troubled by being teased. All must
acknowledge, then, that a child teases
because It has discovered that a par
ent's decision Is not final. The child
has discovered that, by persisting, he
can get the parent to grant the request.
If for no other reason than to get rid
of him.
hesitates momentarily and seems In
doubt as to what to do, the child is
apt to repeat the request. If past ex
perience has shown that frequent re
quests will generally cause a more fa
vorable answer, the repeated request
will -be sure to come. Such a parent
may expect to be teased for anything
a child wants.
Twelfth Talk to Parents by Wm. J. Shearer.
CRYING AND TEASING
morning when I received another letter,
also addressed, as regards the envelope,
to myself as the former had been. In
this letter the same writer explains the
same circumstances, but now it is my
"wholesome and touching", story of
which he has heard, and it is the ser
vice J am "rendering to pure literature"
which has charmed him: then I knew
the former letter was not intended for
me. It is still a book, however, that he
asks, and he concludes that "If you in
cline your ear and send me your book
it will be to me as bread to the starving
Indian and as water to the thirsty
Arab." The peroration seemed to be
permanent, and possibly the introduc
tion, but the middle part of the letter
was varied, according to the author
whom he was approaching. And one
wonders how much this gentleman se
cured In the course of a year.
Should one have anything whatever
to do with literature, then he will re
ceive, although he be neither an editor
nor a critic, a considerable number of
letters between January and December,
containing MSS. for his reading and
Judgment.
This correspondence is not without
pathos, for occasionally, though not
very often, the writer Is anxious to tarn
a little money In time of distress, but It
also has its perils.
The latest specimen which I have
added , to my store is a letter from a
man of whom I have heard, but whom
I do not know, asking me to Introduce
a man, of whom I have never heard, to
a club, of which I am not a member, to
do everything I can to secure his elec
tion, and to let him know the result as
soon as possible. The whole letter con
veys the Idea that the request Is & fa
vor conferred upon me, which will lay ;
me under a deep sense of responsibility
find eternal gratitude. The most disap
pointing letter . I ever ' receivedâ al- :
though my. hopes had not reached the ,
boiling pointâ- was one without a signa
ture, informing me that the writer had
been so touched by the sentiment of one
of my stories, and wag generally so
much Impressed by my remarkable lit
erary ability that he: had placed Â£1000
to my credit with a London bank as a
token of gratitude. As I .. have never
heard anything more of this generous
gift, 4 1 am driven reluctantly to the sad
! conclusion , that the letter was written
Â¦in a: spirit 'of . unworthy sarcasm, and
that/its author desired; to; convey the
impressions that he thought very, mean- ';
ly, both" of myself and my work. ? He
was entitled to ' his opinion,' but it was
cruelto trifle with the worldly hopes of
a struggling literary/man, and to lead
him into ithe extravagance of a -new
top coat,. when' the old one would have
done' perfectly well for another, winter.

him very much. For fifty years he has

"""Indeed, before her mother's death.
Helen Gould had learned to depend up
on me In many ways. She is my daugh

town and was waiting here to receive
me the day I came here to live.
"I remember the first time Helen
Gould came to me, telling me of her
great love for the Bible and her desire
to study and know it better. It was the
day "of Garfleld's funeral. We had re

impressive, and the circumstances of
his death had rendered them even more
so. She told me then as we sat alone

"The average society woman to-day
will not rise at a seasonable hour In the
morning. Her day really begins when
the ordinary woman's day is half lived
through. Naturally the social demands
of the hour on the society woman are
a heavy drain upon her strength and
vitality ,jbut then everything Is done to
save her. Her children are brought up
on scientific principles In order to spare
her all maternal cares and duties. From
the moment of its birth the baby is
placed In the hands of a trained nurse,
and every .detail of Its upbringing Is
worked out on scientific lines.
"A friend of mine was telling me the
other day an incident which appealed
to me most pathetically. 'Babies,' she

"The weather changed suddenly one
night, .when the baby she was telling
me about was only three or four days
old, and the nurse .had told her In the
most matter of fact way that she had

with a child of my own, the mother In

me and would come and see me, beg

that the whole Caribbean coast of Co
lombia, as well as the hundreds of miles
of . Pacific coast,' were actually con
trolled, there are a dozen ways the
Colombians could obtain arms.'
Of course. Colombian paper money is
not worth much, but the war smug
glers of Curacao and Trinidad do not
want money, or rather they have plen
ty of it.. What they want are conces
sions and mining patents, and no coun
try can give more of these than Co
lombia. Â¦
Again, there is a branch of the Ori
noco, the Meta, which is Just; getting
on the maps, that is navigable for
large bungoes and even for small light
draught steamers to a point within
three days' mule training of Bogota.
This avenue of contraband we could
riot well shut off without holding the
mouths of the Orinoco higher up,
Ciudad Bolivar Itself, and if we did
this there would still be twenty chan
nels known to the smugglers through
which the Bogota Government could be
supplied. .
I think It may be accepted as a fact
that it is incorrect to say, as has been
said, and upon such high authority, in
the, last few days, that Colombia is In-^
capable of waging, war. It seems to
me there is no country better situated
for carrying on a twenty or a thirty
years' war, and, then, she has.nothing
else to do. It la perhaps an idle pur
suit to speculate as to whether Colom
bia will \ fight or not. but I must say
that I have vet to meet â¢ any one at
all conversant' with conditions there
who has any doubt that the upshot of
the present. affair will be a war in
which we shall Inevitably become in
vol ved.
. The following statement, - however,
written ; by William I* . Scruggs,
formerly and for â¢ many years our dip
lomatic Â¦ representative in Colombia,
gums up the situation, and It should be
remembered it was '^written before the
question \ of the canal entered upon its
present phase. I.It states, valuable facts
and i explains many things t which have
not been made : clear:
Â¦ â¢â¢.".- "The so-called state of Panama Is
co-extenslve with the isthmus of that
"And yet, strange to say, this Is pre
cisely the section of which Colombians
seem to feel most proud. Like a.de
formed and useless member of a family,
it is a sort of pet of the household, hu
mored and spoiled and habitually de
ferred to by all the others. It has al
ready cost the central government, in
the way of reclamations growing out of
local disorders, more than the entire
state would bring if put up at auction,
and yet, if you would touch the pride
of the average Colombian at most
sensitive point, just Intimate that his
Government might be induced to part
with the sovereignty of the Isthmus.
"He believes Panama to be 'the navel
of the world* and that at some time or
other, and in some manner not clear
even to his own mind, it will be the
source of fabulous wealth. Stranger
still, he seems to have the Impression
that this particular spot is coveted by
all the nations of the world, and that
'the United States of the North,', as he
persistently calls the title of our Gov
ernment, Is merely awaiting some fa
vorable pretext to take forcible posses
sion of it. Nevertheless, every time
the Federal Government of Bogota gets
into serious trouble with its 'revolu
tionists' on the isthmus it Importunes
the Washington- authorities tcv inter
vene for the preservation of order
there." .
There is at least one man on the side
of. Colombia that it would be a pleasure
name and comprises an area of about
30,000 Bquare miles. Its present popu
lation is about four hundred thousand,
including an independent tribe of In
dians, who are said to number about
eight thousand. It is the most north
ern of the nine constituent common
wealths of the present Colombian un
ion and to most foreigners is better
known than the republic Itself. The re

tinent la habitually misjudged.by what
little is here* seen of it.
It would. It is truc.be well-nigh im
possible for a civilized army to make

tal poets to dwell upon how much high
er their cataract is than but
it won't quite replace Panama. We
should go very gently with our brother
republicans in this matter, because
their loss is rot merely geographical
and political, but it is literary as well.
For instance, Panama, "the place of
the butterflies" In the Carib tongue,
has now become the mart and work
shop of the hard-working, cadaverous
Gringo, and. of course, all mention of
It will have to be omitted from the Par
nasso Colombians, ten portly tomes,
weighing nish a ton. in which all the
Colombian poets are etishrlned.
If poets cannot do business it is a
matter of record that they can fight,
and I think that we are overconfident
in the assertion that has come so fre
quently from Washington that as long
as the United States navy holds the sea
and prevents the embarkation of Co
lombian troops the people of Panama
need have no fear of a land attack.
Armed forces have reached the Isthmus
before this, coming from the central
provinces by land via Tumaco, and I
think we shall shortly see them doing
bo again. If we ignore the possibility
of such a step, nothing would be easier
than for a small guerrilla force to cut
the Panama Railway and cause untold
damage.
It would seem that a great historic
momentum, a politiccJ opportunity un
paralleled, a last change to get into the
midst of things, has been lost, but this
has befallen a Government of poetast
ers before, and probably will again.
The President to-day is Jose Marie
Marroqtiln, a sage, a philosopher and
a discreet poet. When once the mobs
that control the streets of his elevated
capital are quelled Marroquin will
probably invite all rhymsters to a
poetry party at the Falls of Tequen
dama. where the icy water falls two
hundred yards from the cold country of
the plain down into the warm, luscious
countryâ the tierra calienteâ where
there are orange trees and blue butter
flies and palm trees, with parrots
perched upon them, talking fluently.
Just as though they were in the Con
greso.

ing as they do S00O meters above the

rather as the builders uf lofty rhyme

Indeed, the traveler, whether he at
tempt to reach this poets' nest by boat
along the swampy Magdalena River, or
by three weeks' muleback from Buena
Ventura, en the Pacific Coast, comes
to the conclusion that the Bogotans are
almost too sublimated for this vale of
tears. Be this as it may, it is a fact
that the only roads in the country are
the mule tracks and the goat trails
which the Conquistadores bequeathed
to it.
After decades of discussion, which
dates from the days of Bolivar the
Liberator and involves the diplomatic
career of William Henry Harrison, af
terward President of the United States,
and Caleb Curbing, whose activity as
Uncle Sam's agent was truly world
wide, the site cf the proposed canal
would seem to have passed irrevocably
out of the hands of the people of Bo
gota.
All the news from Bogota goes to
show that Reyes was not one of those
obstructionists who are responsible for
the present situation. But he is the
last man to yield an inch of his na
tional inheritance and just the man to
lead an army on the" long land trail
from Bogota to the isthmus In Its de
fense.
So Rafael Reyes, the refugee, was
made Minister Plenipotentiary to
France, and the Paris Geographical So
ciety esteemed it an honor to have tha
privilege of publishing In Its bulletins
the record of his Inland Odyssey.
The Journey which he began to save
his life Reyes continued, to the Inestim
able gain of science. The canoe trip
down the Orinoco would have sufficed
most men. but It only awakened in
Reyes a hitherto unsuspected thirst for
travel and scientific research. The de
tails of his explorations are too absorb
ingly interesting to be condensed, but
a skeleton chart or outline drawing will
give some Idea of the caliber of the
man.
Starting on foot from the Padflo
Coast of Colombia and following the
banks of the Tapura through entirely
unknown regions, for the greater part
uninhabited even by Indians, Reyes at
last reached the great Amazon, and.
building a canoe, floated down to Para
and the Atlantic Within a few months
after this Journey waa completed aa
enterprising firm of English shipown
ers availed themselves ot Reyes* dis
coveries and placed a line of steamer*
along the route he had traveled, and
aa a result an extremely profitable,
and let us hope civilizing, trade has
sprung up.
But Reyes waa an explorer, not â¢
promoter, and while the merchants
were getting ready to exploit the field
he had opened he disappeared In an
other direction. He had heard of a
noble, although somewhat lonely,
stream, the Tocantln. which runs
through Brazil to Para, where It con
nects with the Amazon. Accompanied
by brothers .and his nephew, he fol
lowed the stream upward for uncounted
miles. At last they came to the head
waters of the great river and to a
mountain range which under various
names extends across the entire
breadth of South America between the
tenth and twelfth degrees of latitude.
Undeterred by this great natural ob
stacle, Reyes and his companions
pushed on. and on the other side of the
mountain they came upon the head
waters of the Parana, down which
they floated into the River Plate. land-
Ins at Buenos Ayres.
In a word, they proved what had
never been suspected before, that South
America from 35 degrees south to 10
degrees north of the equator Is supplied'
by nature with the most magnificent
water system that can be imagined.
There Is but one cutting of less than
fifteen miles to be made, and even that.
It is suspected, may prove unnecessary
on closer Investigation. Indeed, with
only the ramifications which are known
at present, this perfect waterway ex
tends from the western point of Peru
to the most eastern point of Brazil
and from Colombia on the north well
into Argentina and Uruguay on the
south. In the course of these Journeys
through virgin forests and up streams
never before traversed by white men
Reyes ran and survived many dangers.
Like the few Colombians who are of
pure Spanish descent. Reyes Is very
proud of his ancestry. After the Con
gress closed he said, with reference
to Panama: "I firmly believe tha
United States will finish the canal
within five yearsl I certainly trust she
wllL A river of gold will flow to the
isthmus from the day the first ship
floats through. The United States will
benefit, Colombia will benefit: the open
ing of the canal, too long delayed, will
benefit the whole world."
When his work was accomplished and
the veil of mystery that bad hung so
long over the interior of South America
was raised, there was much enthusiasm
In Colombia, and the demand waa made
of the Government of the day, not by
any party, but by the people of the
country, that he who had so honored
his native land be in turn given that
recognition which was the least of hia
deserts.
He Is superficially an accomplished
boulevardler. but with a Quick, feline
step and now and again a glance of the
eye which somehow or other always
suggested the jaguar of his native Jun
gle.
Whatever may be the result of his
present mission, whether his political
activity will prove a bane or a blessing,
it Is certain that as an explorer Rafael
Reyes has gathered Imperishable lau
rels. He has laid bare the secrets of
South America as did Marco Polo those
of Asia and as Stanley In our own day
and generation threw the first light
upon the Dark Continent.
His Journeys led him from Panama to
Patagonia. In all he traveled twenty*
five thousand miles, and every step he
took was through regions hitherto un
known to the pioneer of any race or
civilization. If the story bÂ« true which
I have often heard in South America
that Reyes began his explorations by
the merest chance â that. In fact, the
first Journey he undertook was to get
out of Colombia by the back doorâ that
is. down the Orinoco, because all the
ports and main traveled roads were
held by his enemiesâ then it must be
recognized that the revolution which
sent Reyes upon his scientific wander
ings was the most profitable revolu
tion that South America has ever pro
duced.
â¢â¢ What Alexander Humboldt did foÂ»
the shell, that Reyes has done for the
kernel and the heart of the great conti
nent to the south of us. In the twelve
years that followed his hasty departure
from Bogota Reyes never returned to
the fickle capital from which, like the
great Liberator, Bolivar himself, it Is
said, he escaped with but his life and
a handful of faithful friends.

There is a sure place for Mitchell's
book on greenbacks. The experience of
the United States with the greenbacks
is of peculiar Interest from both the
historical and economic points of view.
This monograph treats the subject from
both points of view, the first part being
devoted to the study of the chain of
events which led up to the issue of the
paper money, and the second part trac
ing in detail the effects of the desertion
of a metallic for a paper standard. The
elaborate chapter on wages includes a
detailed analysis of the Aldrich Report
in comparison with the hitherto almost
unused material by J. D. Weeks in
volume XX of the Census of 1880. An
interesting feature is the incidental sta
tistical demonstration of an element of
truth in the much despised subsistence
theory of wages. Similar studies on
rent, interest and profits are followed
by a chapter upon "The Greenbacks
and the Cost of the Civil War," show
ing to what degree the paper issues in
creased expense incurred by the Gov
ernment in carrying on the struggle.
Not ,the least valuable feature of
Mitchell's book are the statistical ap
pendices. These comprise tables drawn
from the most authoritative sources
upon the relative prices of commodities
during the war period of greenback
currency and the relative wage rates
during the same period.

These Few Hints
TWO books have appeared within
the month which will take a high
place in the literature of econom
ics. They are "Getting a Living," by
George L. Bolen, the author of the last
year's standard book on the trusts, and
"A History of the Greenbacks." by
Wesley Clair Mitchell of the depart
ment of political economy in the Uni
versity of Chicago.
The time for ponderous volumes re
viewing the whole subject of economics
is pact. The subject has become so
great that a scholar nowdays may
think himself fit to speak if he is
learned in one of the many branches of
the science. With the growth of the
eubject of economics has come the ten
dency toward specialization. These
two important contributions to eco
nomic literature are then the work of
specialists and as such are worthy to
be received as authoritative. Their
timeliness and the direct bearing they
have upon living issues in the industrial
life of to-day are added recommenda
tions.
The title of Rolen's book is somewhat
vague and needs the subcaption of "the
problem of wealth and poverty, union
ism and socialism," to convey the pur
pose of the work. . Grave questions are
these and many have been the frothing
screeds written for and against these
modern Issues since they became such.
But it is safe to say that the author of
"Getting a Living" has treated these
various topics with a fair-mindedness
which is unique. It, 'is the only work
of all the partisan literature upon la
bor, capital and socialism designed to
give a fair approach to the whole truth.
At the very outset Bolen seeks to
clear the cobwebs of controversy away
from Henry George's single tax . and
land ownership theories and show in an
impartial way their strong points and
their fallacies. Bolen would . have it
that, far from being a parasite, the
landowner does a service to society by
the very fact of his "ownership. The
unearned increment from land which,
according to Henry George's theory,
is the unearned gift of society to the
landholder. Is really the reward of the
landholder's degree of risk, says Bolen.
The author cannot see that George's
theory of taxing all the economic rent
la the first ossay of the collection,
v.hJch strikes the keynote of the au
thor's theirÂ»e ax.d from which the title
of the publication is drawn. Dr. Jor
dan's single aim is to establish the mu
tual interdependence existing between
democracy and university culture. Far
from causing to arise an educated pro
letariat which might easily slip into an
arrogant oligarchy of knowledge, the
spirit of the university training, says
Dr. Jordan, makes for the broadening
of the common Intellectuality and the
Eafeguarding cf principles too often
exposed to the attacks of uneducated
demagogues. Says the essayist:
"Culture not only raises the man
above the mÂ£Â£s, it turns the masses
into men. That the multitude may Im
agine themselves men before they hold
a man's grasp on life is the greatest
danger of democracy. Here again the
university plays its part, teaching the
relative value of ideals. Under its
criticism men learn that good results
are better than good intentions, and
they demand a far higher order of skill
and courage."
Of the duty of the scholar to speak
r* VERYTHING that President Da
gi^ vid Starr Jordan writes is pur
poseful; whether he writes in be
half of the Alaskan seal or of co-edu
cation In universities, the thing which
comes from his pen is strong with a
mifsion. Therefore the reader who
picks up "The Voice of the Scholar,"
Dr. Jordan's latest published thought,
icay do so with the assurance that he
will find therein something which will
ring with the sincerity of a strong
man's advocacy of a worthy cause.
This collection of essays, built upon
addresses made by Dr. Jordan before
various audiences, is a plea for the
universal recognition of the American
university jis one of the great factors
In American national life. Not only
does Dr. Jordan address his arguments
to the hard-headed business man who
fails to see In a univerrity education
anything save four years of frivolity,
but he exhorts the college man to grasp
to its fullest extent the conception of
the university as the leaven for the
massesâ the lever which is his to move
society. The essays are the vade me
cum for the latter day scholar-citizen,
as Ernerson'G "American Scholar"
formed, seventy years ago, the thlrty
ijjrK- articles of the scholar-pedant.
The delicate question of trades
unions, strikes and boycotts the author
treats with a sure grasp. He defends the
union idea as being within the natural
province of the wage-earner. But in a
chapter devoted to questionable policies
of trade unions he censures the union's
general objection to piecework as evinc
inc a disposition to render dishonest re
turn for wages, and deplores the ten
dency of unions to form a monopoly of
labor by sympathetic strikes;
In chapters uppn the modern condi
tions of the poor and unemployed,
prison labor, labor laws and kindred
subjects, Bolen closes his work. A
work it is which is not wanting in ex
pression of opinions but is remarkably
rich in facts.

York; price $2 00.)
of land would mean less than robbery
if put into practice.
Upon co-operation as the only tenet
of socialism now in any measure of
general usagre Bolen contents himself
with adducing- the statistics of indus
tries which have been carried on on a
co-operative basis and asking this
questionâ if the attempts at co-opera
tion havÂ« not resulted in anything more
than partial successes and those only
transient, should we do away with in
dividual competition for the sake of the
closer brotherhood of man?

rative.
To these standards the story of Stev
enson answers with hardly an excep
tion. At .; first blush the reader is
thrown into a Coroner's inquest in New
York City, where circumstantial evi
dence points to a beautiful heiress as
the slayer of. her father. Because the
chief witness is color-blind she is saved
from the grip of the law only to fall
under the influence of a mysterious
Frenchman with the manners of a
Chesterfield and the heart of a Ma
chiavclli. She disappears, the French
man 'reveals his. plot by over zealous
attention to details and then begins an
exciting chase o'er seasrto a little
French fishing ylllage-^-and the solution
of the mystery.'
The author ; carries his tale with a
wonderful' swing and the situations are 1
all fresh and well worked out. It is
unfortunate/ however, that he should
have given in to the demands of the
time and added a love thread to the
story. Love and sudden death by stab

melodrama (15, 25 and 30 cents admis

In this latter book, "When I Was
Czar," the Hope idea has run wild.
Where the master of the craft content
ed himself with the possibilities of one
plot idea, well worked out, his Imitator
has built a hook which is a mere suc
cession of hair-raising adventures, one
after another. Hope so skillfully veiled
the machinery of his romances that tho
figures seem to move of their own voli
tion and not with the wooden mechani
cal Jerk of the marionette. In March
mount's story the situations are ob
viously all set and ready to be revealed
to the reader with the- actors moving
precisely in the proper groove â Just
where the reader expects -them to be.
Harper C. Denver, an American
traveling in Russia for pleasure, hap
pens to look like the Czar. An astute
minister seizes upon this fortuitous cir
cumstance to Inveigle said American
into a secret mission. Notwithstanding
the fact that Nicholas never is known
to stir out of the palace unattended, the
author makes this pseudo Czar go to all
sorts of Impossible places alone with a
fair conspirator, be set upon by Nihil
ists and brought to look upon sudden
death In every chapter. All this be
cause an American citizen happened to
resemble the Czar of all the Russlas.

In selecting the name of Hunch Ba
deau for the hero of his successful
new. novel, "His Little World," Mr.
Samuel Merwln apparently chose a
name sufficiently unusual, but an In
quiry, has been received from a bearer
of the" latter part of the name as to
the Identity of Mr. Merwin's character.
It would naturally be difficult to trace
a' relationship with a hero existing only
In Mr. Merwin's vivid Imagination.

"The scholar is silent for the most
part in the rush and hurry of the
world. When he has no reason for
talking he reserves his strength for hia
own due season and his own line of ac
tion. Kut he must be free to speak
when needs arise. The scholar should
be above all influences of passion or
profit. He should speak for the clear,
hard, unyielding, unflattering, unpity
l .ng truth. If he enters the arena he
must take his chances with the rest.
His thoughts must be his only wea
pon."
In an essay under the caption.
"Apology for the American Univer
sity," the author reviews the growth
of the typical college of fifty years ago.
when men were educated more for
the sake of the degree than for the
practical value of their knowledge,
down to the present exalted concep
tion of a university and its work. With
the broader sphere of the university
conies the need for broader teachers.
Here is what Dr. Jordan has to say
upon that score:
"Doubtless the average professor
isn't worth $2000 a year.* Doubtless
you could fill every chair here on $300.
But that is not the point. The fact Is,
the average college professor is worth
very little indeed. It is not average
men. but real men that make a'univer
sity. Some real men you have, and
you know who they. are. "There is no
excuse for you to employ any others.
Average men and average teachers you
can buy tied in bunches at any price
you choose to offer. For real men you
must look far and wiae, for they are
in constant; demand."
Strong words are they, but their
truth is being proven yearly.
Upon the much agitated question of
co-education the president of Stanford
University ppeaks with no uncertain
speech. He believes that women have
a right to higher education; that they
arc, as a rule, fitted for it in the mat
ter of mental qualities, and that co
education in the same institutions with
men is the best method for accom
plishing the end, in view.
Stanford's president writes as he
talks; his vigorous personality domi
nates every sentence. By the direct
ness of his diction the clarity of his
thought he causes the reader to feel
that in every assertion he makes he is
deadly In earnest. Sincerity is the In
herent quality of the book.

A child's tele, say youâ a yarn fit to
be told ever the nursery fire along with
the diverting adventures of Robin Hood
and the brave knights at Chevy Chase.
Granted, a good story for children ;b
that of. King Arthur, but what have
been all the folk stories of our litera
ture but the twilight tales recounted
by the father to the little ones? Of all
the literature of the people who read
not the hand-printed books of . those
dim and dusty ages but a few precious
remnants remain. For the few who can
appreciate, Tennyson has immortalized
this persistent fragment about the
mythical king; for the many who can
not Pyle has reproduced the old min
etrels' lay in a quaint semblance of its
hoary self.
As in the case of the cycle of Robin
Hood and the bard or bards who first
sung that spirited lay of greenwood
fights end springtime roysterings the
raconteur who first told the tale cf good
King Arthur has passed these many
centuries unhonored and unsung. It Is
an odd study to trace our great English
epic, now rejuvenated again in popular
form, through the many varying rami
fications of growth and change which
it has experienced.
Away back In the time of William the
Conqueror, when v.andering Nor

neyed from castle to castle, the
cones of Arthur, the great king,
were sung before the banquet
boards of the conquering nobles.
Nameless to us arc the minstrels, for Jt

mythical monarch were greatly elabor
ated upon and by him incorporated in

French of the court and it was not until
a gentle soul by the name of Layamon
translated the cycle of tales into the

Btory which had sprung from the people
found its way back to them again.
In the version which Howard Pyle
has presented to modern readers he
hfis with much quaint humor adopted
the stilted style of the old chroniclers

seriousness he announces in hia fore
word that he is able "by the crace of
God to write this work with such pleas

of the joy that it hath afforded me.
I shall be very well content with what I

of language the stories of Lady Guine

brave old knights and ladies roll out
as if from the mouth cf a court bard in

At the beginning of an enthusiastic
review of Mr. James Bryce's "Studies
In Contemporary Biography" in the
Atlantic Monthly, Mrs. Harriet Wat
ers Preston says: "In one of his re
cently collected 'Studies in Contem
porary Biography/ the Right Honor
able James Bryce remarks of that
eminent scholar, the late Lord Acton,
that 'his mastery of the so-called hu
man subjects was unequaled'; and
now that Lord Acton is no more, the
same thing might fairly be said of Mr.
Bryce himself." Mrs. Preston goes
on to say that "the twenty odd char
acter studies brought together In the
new volume afford fresh evidence of
Mr. Bryce's breadth and acumen as
well as of his unusually wide ac
quaintance among the leading minds
of the day. The most admirable feat
ure of these twenty-one studies is
their impartiality of appreciation. It
Is a Il3t of shining names."
"Might have been written by Guy da
Maupassant." remarks the Chicago
Evening Post of Robert Herrtck'a
"Their Child." It is not a rollicking
tale, like Water's "Philosophy 4," this
Issue in the series of "Little Novels by
Favorite Authors," but a study in
heredity, with a certain flavor of Bal
zac. The plot turns upon a flve-year
old boy who suddenly reveals the wick
edness of his grandslreâ a fierce old
Berserker in the mad ragesâ and upon
the temptation that comes to his
parents to drown their sorrowsâ he in

hood's sweetheart.
The Scottish papers are delighted
with Mr. Clifton Johnson's "The Land
of Heather." They all write of It
with much interest. The Scotsman,
for Instance, styles the book "a plain
and photographic account of what ob
servant and sympathetic American
eyes saw In a leisurely sojourn In
Scotland. He does v-.-hat he sets him
self to do very well. He tells in an
easy, unstudied way what he sees and
hears. The sketches are touched with
sufficient nicety and accuracy to make
them interesting."
Hamlln Garland, author of "Hes
per." tells an interesting: story of how
he got his first inspiration to writs
fiction. He had left Wisconsin for a
time, and was sitting in a little attic
room In Boston, wondering about his
future, when he heard a man unload
ing a cartload of coal in the street
below. The sound made by the coal
as it was released from the man's
shovel â a sort of ringing scrape
seemed exactly like the sound made
by shoveling corn into a corncrlb. It
brought back to the homesick young
man a vivid picture of his home, the
farm and the life he had left. The
inspiration for a story came to him,
and he wrote a tale that was pub
lished In the New American Maga
zine of New York, then edited by
William Wyckoff. This was In 18S5,
and the story was afterward incor
porated In Mr. Garland's "Boy Ufa on
the Prairie." and reproduced in his
lecture on "Life on the Prairie."
Technical College at Pittsburg In Oc
tober. 1904. It Is to be hoped that he
will find It agreeable to make other
public appearances In this country,
which he has not visited for more than
thirty years. A lecture on Gladstone
by Mr. Morley would take the country
by storm, and he would be sure of ap
preciative audiences if he would speak
on literary topics.

* * [ \j*jSuch a thing was unheard of. Jacob
Kent was making the fire, chopping
wood, packing waterâ doing menial
tasks for a guest!
"Strike me blind, but you're a'ust

miringly, his head cocked to one side,
as his host bustled about. "You never

ages and men, metaphors and mon

Jacob Kent was paralyzed. He shrank
back, his arms lifted as though to ward
off physical violence.
"The nun's knocked the bottom out o'
the trail," said the Man with the Gash.
"An* 1 only 'ope you'll appreciate the

The pleasures of life had culminated in the continual weighing and reweighing of his gold dust.

"W-w-whcre'd you get it?" Kent at
last managed to articulate, raising a
thaklng; forefinger to the ghastly 6car
which seamed the other's cheek.
The man looked at him curiously.
"Oh, that's all right," he said, wav
ing his hand deprecatlngly. "You
needn't think as I'll 'arm you or j*our
blasted dust. You're a rum 'tin, you
are," he added reflectively, as he
watched the sweat pouring from off
Kent's face and the quavering of his
knees. "Wy don't you pipe up an*
cay somcthin'?" he went on, as the
other struggled for breath. "Wot's
goiie wrong o" your gaff? Any think
the matter':"
Jacob Kent wheeled about, at the
same time reaching for his double
barreled shotgun, which stood handy.
But when his eyes lit on the intruder's
face he staggered back dizzily. It was
the face of the Man with the Gash!
Often he dreamed that Buch was the
case, and awoke in the crip of night
mare. A Belect number of these rob
bers haunted him through his dreams,
end he came to know them quite well,
especially the bronzed leader with the
pash en his right check. This fellow
was the most persistent of the lot, and,
becauee of h!m, he had. in his waking
moments, constructed several score of
hiding places in and about the cabin.
After a concealment he would breathe
freely again, perhaps for several
nights, only to collar the Man with the
Gash in the very act of unearthing the
sack. Then, on awakening in the midst
of the usual struggle he would at once
get up and transfer the bag to a new
and more ingenious crypt. So he con
tinued to bleed the unfortunates who
crgssed his threshold, and at the same
time to add to his trouble with every
ounce that went into the sack.
As he sat sunning himself a thought
came to Jacob Kent that brought him
to his feet with a jerk. The pleasures
of life had culminated in the continual
weighing and reweighing of his dust;
but a shadow had been thrown upon
his pleasant avocation, which he had
hitherto failed to brush aside. His gold
scales were quite small; in fact, their
maximum 'was a pound and a half â
eighteen ounces â while his hoard
mounted up to something like three
and a third times that. He had never
been able to weigh it all at one opera
tion. It was the solution of this prob
lem flashing across his mind that had
Just brought him to his feet. .He
searched the trail carefully in either
direction. There was nothing in sight,
so he went inside.
In a few seconds he had the table
cleared away and the scales set up.
On one ride he placed the stamped
disks to the equivalent of fifteen
ounces, and balanced it with dust on
the other. Replacing the weights with
dust, he then had thirty ounces pre
cisely balanced. These, In turn, he
placed together on one side and again
balanced with more dust. By this time
the sold was exhausted, and he was
sweating liberally. He trembled with
ecstasy, ravished beyond measure.
Nevertheless, he dusted the sack thor
oughly, to the last least grain, till the
balace was overcome and one side of
the scales sank to the table. Equilib
rium, however, was restored by the ad
dition of a pennyweight and five grains
to the opposite side. He stood, head
thrown back, transfixed.
The sack was empty, but the poten
tiality of the scales had become Im
measurable. Upon them he could weigh
any amount, from the tiniest grain to
' pounds upon pounds. Mammon laid
hot fingers on his heart. The sun swung
on Its westering way till It flashed
through the open doorway, full upon
the yellow-burdened scales.
"Gawd bllme me! but ybu 'ave the
makin' of several quid there, 'aven't
you?"
Jacob Kent was feeling particularly
food that afternoon. The record had
been broken the previous night, and
he had sold his hospitality to no less
than twenty-eight visitors. True, it
bad been quite uncomfortable, and four
had snored beneath his bunk all night;
but then it had added appreciable
weight to the Back in which he kept
his gold dust That sack, with Its glit
tering yellow treasure, was at once the
chief delight and the chief bane of his
existence. Heaven and hell lay within
its slender mouth. In the nature of
things, there being no privacy to his
one-roomed dwelling, he was tortured
by a constant fear of theft. It would
be very easy for these bearded, despe'r
ate-Iooklns strangers to make way
with It.
One afternoon in April he sat by his
doorâ for all the world like a predatory
spiderâ marveling at the heat of the
returning sun and keeping an eye on
the trail for prospective flies. The
Yukon lay at his feet, a eea of ice,
disappearing around two great bends
to the north and south and 6tretchlng
an honest two miles from bank to
bank.
waCOB KEN'T had suffered from
( cupidity all the days of his life.
1 He had been a weaver of cloth
Oj from the cradle until the fever
of Klondike had entered his blood and
torn him away from his loom. His
cabin stood midway between Sixty
mile Post and the Stuart River, and
men who made it a custom to travel
the trail to Dawson likened him to a
robber baron, perched in his fortress
and exacting toll from the caravans
that used his ill-kept roads.

"No, no," Kent answered, sinking
upon a stool with a sickly grin.' "I was'
Just wondering."
"Did you ever see the like?" the
other went on truculently.
"No." :
"Ain't it a beute?" ' '
"Ye?." Kent nodded Ws . head . ap
provingly. intent on humoring this
strange visitor, but wholly unprepared
for the outburst which was to follow
his effort to be agreeable.
"You blasted, bloomin*. burgoo-eatln'

"Do.lt 'urt you?" Jim Cardegee thun

Kent was so nervous that' it took
three puffs to blow out the slush-lamp,
and he crawled into his blankets with-
the shotgun without spilling a particle,
rammed it down with double wads and
then put everything away and got back
Into bed. *~
Just as daylight laid Its steel-gray
fingers on the parchment window Jacob
Kent awoke. Turning on his elbow,
he raised the lid and peered into the
ammunition box. Whatever he saw,
or whatever he did not see, exercised
a very peculiar effect upon him, con
sldering his neurotic temperament. He
glanced at the sleeping man on the
floor, let the lid down gently and' rolled
over on his back. It was an unwonted
calm that rested. on his face. Not a
muscle Quivered. There was not. the
least sign of excitement or perturba-
* Â¦ -.
"Wot?" Cardegee asked, as doon as
he had caught his breath. .
"The gold dust." \
"Wot gold dust?" the perplexed sailor
demanded.
"i"ou know well enoughâ mine."
"Ain't seen nothlnk of It. Wot do yo
take, me for? A safe deposit? Wot
'ave I got to do. with it, any'oxv?"
"Mebbe you know, and mebbe you

"Vast heavln*!" Cardegee roared, as
the rope tightened.
Kent eased away a moment, and the
sailor, wriggling his neck as though
"Whom- God have mercy upon if she
loves you. 'Ah! Would you?" He frus
trated a hostile move on the- part of
the other by, pressing the cold muzzle
against his forehead. "Lay quiet, now!
If you light as much as a hair, you'll
get it."
It was rather an awkward task, with
flie trigger of the gun always within
pulling distance of the finger; but Kent
was a weaver, and In a few minutes
had the sailor tied hand and foot.
Then he dragged him without and laid
"AnV it's a pretty mess as you'll make

lighting for time: "Now, look 'ere, I'll

courses in his, shebang, and you ob

I'll bore you as sure as Moses!"

Just then Kent heard the Jarrlns
churn of the runners and turned hi3
eyes to the trail. The driver was lying
flat on the sled and the dogs swinging
down the straight stretch to the cabin.
Kent whirled back, bringing his rifle
to shoulder.
"It ain't eight bells yet!" Cardegee
expostulated. "I'll 'aunt you, sure."
Jacob Kent faltered. He was stand-
Ing by the sun-dial, perhaps ten paces
from his victim. The man on the sled
must have seen that something un
usual was taking place, for he had
risen to his knees, his whip singing
viciously among the dogs.
The shadows swept Into line. Kent
looked along the Eights.
"Make ready!" he commanded sol
emnly. "Eight b "
But Just a fraction of a second too
soon, Cardegee rolled backward into
the hole. Kent held his fire and ran
to the edge. Bang! The gun exploded
full In the sailor's face as he rose to
his feet. But no smoke came from tha
muzzle; instead, a sheet of flame burst
from the side of the barrel near Its butt
and Jacob Kent went down. The dogs
dashed up the bank, dragging the sled
over his body, and the driver sprang
off as Jim Cardegee freed his hands
and drew himself from the hole.
"Jim!" The newcomer recognized
him. "What's the matter?"
"Wot's the matter? Oh, nothink at
all. It Jest 'appens as I do little things
like this for my 'ealth. Wofs the mat
ter, you bloomin' idjit? Wot's the mat
ter, eh? Cast me loose, or I'll show

decks with you!"
"Huh!" he added, as the other went
to work with his sheath knife. "Wot's
the matter? I want to know. Jes' tell
me that, will you, wot's the matter?
Hey?"
Kent was quite dead when they rolled
him over. The gun, an old-fashioned,
heavy-weighted muzzle loader, lay near
him. Steel and wood had parted com
pany. Near the butt of the right-hand
barrel, with lips pressed outward,
gaped a fissure several Inches in
length. The sailor picked it up curi
ously. A glittering stream of yellow*
dust ran out through the crack. The
facts of the case dawned upon Jim
Cardegee.
"Strike me standin"!" he roared;
" 'ere's a go! 'Ere's Ms bloomin' dust!
Gawd blime me, an' you. too, Charley,
if you don't run an' get the dlshpan!"
"Half an inch."
The sailor wriggled slightly to assure
himself that he would topple over at
the right moment, and slipped the first
turn over his hands.
"'Ow close?" j:<
"One inch."
"Say, 'ow close Is the shadows?"
Cardegee groaned, then stole a glance
at the trail. The Bled was just clearing
a rise, barely a mile away, and tha
dogs were In full lope, running lightly.
"'Ow close is the shadows to the
line?"
Kent walked to the primitive time
piece and studied it. "Three Inches,"
he announced, after a careful survey.
"Say, Jes* sing out 'eight bells' afore
you pull the gun, will you?"
Kent agreed and they lapsed Into
silence. The throngs about Cardegee'a
wrists were slowly stretching, and he
had begun to work them over his
hands.
effort, he endeavored to stretch It more
and more.
He watched the trail hungrily, and
when In the direction of Sixty-mile a
dark speck appeared for a moment
against the white background of an
ice jam he cast an anxious eye at the
sun. It had climbed nearly to the
zenith. Now and again he caught the
black speck clearing the hills of ice and
sinking into the Intervening hollows,
but he dared not permit himself more
than the most cursory glances for fear
of rousing his enemy's suspicion. Oncw
when Jacob Kent rose to his feet and
searched the trail with care Cardegee
was frightened, but the dog sled had
struck a piece of trail running parallel
with a jam, and remained out of sight
till the danger was past.
"I'll see you Ming for this," Cardegee
threatened, attempting to draw the
other's attention. "An* you'll rot In
'ell, Jes* you see If you don't.
"I say," he cried, after another pause;
"d'ye b'lleve in ghosts?" Kent's sudden
start made him sure of his ground, and
he went on: "Now a ghost 'as the right
to 'aunt a man wot don't do wot ha
says; and you can't skiffle me off till

Jacob Kent looked dubious, but de
clined to talk.
"'Ow's your chronometer? Wot'i
your longitude? 'Ow do you know as
your time's correct?" Cardegee persist
ed, vainly hoping to beat his execu
tioner out of a few minutes. "Is it Bar

"I'll send you off all right," Kent re

"Stakes are all set."
" 'Ow did you set 'em? Compass?"
"No; lined them up with the North

, It happened that a heavy wooden peg
had been driven into the ridge-pole just
above Jim Cardegee's; head.. Jacob
Kent, working softly," ran a' piece of
half-inch manlln over it, bringing both
ends to the ground. One end "he tied
about his waist, and in the other he
rove a running noose.' Then- he cocked
his shotgun 3 and' laid it within reach
by the side of -numerous moose-hide
thongs. -.By an effort of will he bore
the sight of the scar, slipped the noose
over the sleeper's head, and drew it
taut by-throwing back on his weight,
at the same time seizing the gun and
bringing it to bear.
Jim Cardegee awake, choking, be
wildered, staring down the twin wells
of steel.

sailor was soon snoring lustily from his
hard bed on the floor, but. Kent lay
staring up into the blackness, one hand
on the shotgun, resolved not to close,
his eyes the whole night. He had not
had an opportunity to secrete his five
pounds of gold, and it lay in the am
munition box at the head of his bunk.
But, try as be would, he at last dozed
off with the. .weight, of. his 'dust, heavy'
on his soul. Had he not inadvertently
fallen asleep with his mind in such con
dition, the somnambulic demon would
not have been Invoked, nor would; Jim
Cardegee have gone mining next day
with a dlshpan. ,
The sailor lay. like a log, while his
host tossed restlessly about, the victim
of strange fantasies. As midnight
drew near he suddenly threw off the
blankets and got up. It was remark
able that he could do what he then did
without ever striking a "light. Perhaps
it-was because of the darkness that he
kept his eyes shut, and perhaps it was
for fear he would see the terrible gash
on the cheek of . his visitor ; but, Â¦â¢ be
this as it may, it is a fact that, unsee

put a heavy charge into the muzzle of

the noose a bit and v.-ork it up so the
point oÂ£ contact was Just under the
chin.
"Well 3," Kent questioned, expecting
the disclosure.
But Cardegee grinned. "Go ahead
with your .'angin', you bloomin' old pot
wolloper!"
Then, as the sailor had anticipated,
the tragedy became a farce. Cardegee
being the heavier of - the two, Kent,
throwing his body backward and down,
could not lift .him clear of the ground.
Strain and strive to the uttermost, 4he
â¢sailor's feet still stuck to the floofand
sustained a part of his weight. The re
maining portion was supported by the
point of contact Just "under his chin.
'Failing to swing him clear, Kent clung
on, resolved to slowly throttle him - or
force him to , tell what he had done
with the hoard. ' But the Man wi th the
Gash '; would not throttle. Five, ten, fif
teen. minutes "passed, and at the "end
*of that'- time, in . despair, Kent let his
prisoner down. :
- "Well," he remarked, wiping- away
the -sweat, "If you won't; hang! you'll
shoot. Some men wasn't born to be

.-Â¦ ys,THE ART OF POSING
1HAVE often thousnt that it woulc
be a good idea and one that woulc
6a ve much time and worry if a llsl
of "don'ts" could be conspicuously
posted in the dressing rooms of e
gallery for the instruction of subjects
while they are waiting for a "sitting.'
The first ''don't" in the art of posing
should be "Don't pose." The nexi
should be "Don't overdress." Aftei
lhat "Don't plaster your hair down,"
"don't wear all the colors of the rain
bow," "don't make posing hard work,'
"don't try to look like some famous
stage favorite." Vdon't be artificial.'
On the contrary, try to be as much likÂ«
vour everyday self as you possibly can.
Then would the art of posing resolve
itself down to a very simple task in
!eed.
It is just such artificialities as those
mumerated above that make subjects
uvkward .and unnatural, where they
;houid be quite at their ease. The
vnole art of posing is nothing more nor
ess than producing graceful curving
Incs. Look on the picture of Miss
Dodge which accompanies this article
o see what I mean. There are no hard
;hcrp angles in that pose to affront the
Â¦ye. Every line tends to bring out this
â¢oung lady's splendid height and cym
netry. Moreover, every curve serves
>ut to accentuate her natural gracious
tess and half sad pensive moods. That
s the secret of bringing out all the
haracter of the subject. Add to this
hat none of the detail of either the
landsome coat or gown has been lost
nd you have the art of posing in itÂ«
erfectlon.
Indeed, I can't too strongly insist
pon the importance of .that one point.
:urves, curves, curves. That should
be the photographer's watchword- No
woman, be she ever so homely; but may
be made at least passably attractive if
all angles are avoided. . ' â ;
And with the curves should go ani
mation whenever and whereveV it is
possible. Animation, even if it is only'
the merest suggestion of a smile, gives
the -impression of action. Moreover, it
is friendly and 'will' serve to attract at
tention from other defects if there are
any.
."'However, subjects as. handsome as
Miss Dodge ar*Â»- extremely rare. To be
gin. with. sHe- is; exceptionally tall, ex
tremely, athletic and robust. That
meant the danger, of .making her seem
masculine lf'she'were' posed at all an
gularly. Then there wa3the complica
tion.- Â£f photographing masses of black
and white at the same time â a difficulty
which even . the veriest amateur'in pho
tography will readily understand, and
which of ' itself, nroducicg as it does
such sharp contrasts la likely to make
ugly angles where least expected. Â¦* And
then, loo, .very tall people all seem to
be afraid of their height and uncon
sciously sag on one hip or the other
when In repose in a vain effort to seem
shorter.* This. simple little mannerism
alone would make the subject seem fat
and shapeless were it not detected and
corrected before the picture is taken.
And thus by the avoidance of all
these things Miss Dodge's superb
height has been brought out in such
manner that she does not seem unnat
urally tall, so perfect are the curves
and so natural the proportion. That
same rule : applies with equal force to
every subject, short or tall, stout
or thin. , Miss Dodge, of course,
has the advantage of being really hand
some and graceful to begin with.

One thing In very certain. The vogue
for lace will. not; lessen, ami the waist
of the future will be wholly or largely
built of this, material which grows In
popularity as It becomes more and
n.ore useful. At no<,tlme since ths reign
of Louis XI were laces so popular. '
!Â¦;Â¦-;. The latest of the new laces were stout
in their texture, of a color that wears
well, and so durable that they can be
washed like calico. It is a fact (hat
many of the new cotton laces can be
tubbed and rubbed and that all the nec
essary strength can be put upon them

a delicious combination of silk and chif
fon, it will be worn by vne woman of
fashion.
Its virtues are that It makes the
shoulder seem a little longer, giving the
slope which is now so' much admired.
It also affords a background upon
which there can be worked the most ex
quisite color patterns, and it Rives an
opportunity for the display of rare fem
inine handiwork. Again the shoulder
ette, if made of lace, shows off well the
handsomer varieties of this rabrlc, and
can be as rich and as elegantly becom
ing as one could desire.
The newest are made with stock and
shoulder cape attached and are em
broidered in Armenian colors and de
signs. Others are cut round In the neck,
partly low, and are shoulder deep and
exquisitely appllqued with small col
ored wheels, with flowers in raised ef
fects, and with all sorts and conditions
of fanciful decorations.
Perhaps the newest form of embroid
ery tor the shoulder cape Is fruit em
broidery. The style is that of the em
broiderer of southern France. And
great bunches of golden grapes, in silk
and in fine cloth and in cloth of gold,
are raised upon the delicate fabric of
lace.

apples, and the smaller plums, are
copied with great fidelity of color up

All of the party wore waist shirts,

Gould's waist was a pale gray foulard
with Email pink figures in it. Her hat

nickel gray cloth trimmed with bands

One of her guests wore a white moire
waist trimmed with strappings of tur
quoise. Another wore a very heavy
white linen, with a front plait covered
with canvas. Upon the canvas there was
a pattern in cross stitch embroidery In
Bohemian design. Reds and blues and
purple were shown on a canvas ground
of cream.
Miss Gould wore no jewelry beyond
a very slender gold chain, which was
closely strung with pierced turquoise.
Upon the table at her side lay a bag
of bl'e beads with a scene inwrought
in silver and crystal beads. The bag
was mounted in gold, and from it Miss
Gould took a beautiful little golden

as the stood up to go. her black hat

her wonderfully neat tailored skirt
made her the object of all eyes. She
looked the t yplcal woman of the sea
eonâthe girl of 1S04.
A Glimpse of the Coming: Girl.
Each woman in the year 1904 will be
a picture.
As she stands dressed, ready for pa
rade, you will want to take a snapshot
of her. She will be well worthy the
work of the camera. Her attire will
be not only extremely striking, but will
be beautiful in its lines and harmoni
ous in its color.
More than that, it will be becoming
and pretty.
Tbe distinguishing feature of the
dress of the woman of 1S04 will be the
color scheme, which makes up her cos
tume. The ombre, or shadow, tones
will form the background upon which
are built up all the beautiful color har
mopies which complete her dress.
Quaint changeable browns, helped out
with orange and blue, will only afford
a more striking background to the dash
of red which will be seen In so many
costumes.
Again, my lady, as she Eteps before
the glass, will be gowned in shadow
blue, that strange blue which la almost
els deep as ink blue, and trimming this
gown will be bands of cherry velvet,
There is no. doubt. whatever that the
neck of 1901 will be cut slightly low. It
will be rounded out, and the blouses of
the coming spring and summer will be
cut with a little finish of Uflft .which re-
likes a trottlnp skirt, but cannot en
dure that slinking in around the foot.
The dancing, or evening, skirt may bÂ«
bouffant, but this is not yet determined.
Several very short and very full danc
ing cotillon gowns have recently convj
from Paris. But, as they tend to make
the woman who wears them look very
short and dumpy, It is certain that th<-y
will not be popular with all.
These short cotillon skirts are trim*
med with flounces and some of them
look very much like the skirts which
were worn Ly the belles of 1860. Shcrt,
full ruffles asd trimmed with lace, they
are almost exact reproductions of the
family portraits of that day.
But the ballroom skirt will be long
and tight-fitting and will tend. to give
a woman the fashionable figure, which
is that of slcndemess, height and >wil-.

They will probably rot gather the
skirts upon the band, but will shirr
them in many shirrings or tuck them
in Spanish style. The tucks win be low
in front and will rise toward the back,
while the skirt is finished with a bouf
fant effect around the foot.
Already many of the trotting skirts,
which are of instep length, are made
bouffant around the foot. This Is ac
complished by the setting in of fans,
bias flounces and little ruffles. The
eklrt, which is as tight as it can be
built, suddenly, flares around the foot
where the^ans cause it to set out. This
style is very good for the woman who
There is every indication that skirts
will be of two kinds. One skirt, which
is the 1830, skirt, will be short and full.
The spring lawns will be made up In
this style and there will bÂ» every in
dication of the return to grandmother's
day. These skirts, when crisp, are v very
pretty, and a neat challie, a mull or a
printed lawn will be very attractive for
piazza, wear, made up in this manner.
The Skirt That Is to Come.
From Paris there comes the whisper
that brown will be the best color of the
year and that ripe brown, which is a
brown with red in it, will be used a
great deal with a most brillianV blue,
which combination makes a very chic
set-off for a handsome face.

and coral red makes up the trimmings
of her hat and stock. Her handbag
and belt will be glazed red leather or
red suede and there will be glimpses of
red in all her small appointments.
Never in the history of dres3 have
colors played as important a part as
they will play this- coming year, and
never was woman allowed as wide a
latitude in the selection thereof. In
the greens she can go from lettuce
green to invisible green, and in the
reds she can shade from a deepest pos
sible tone to the faintest shell pink.
And as for blues, their variety is in
finite. Even purple holds a certain
place in the estimation of those who
dress smartly in the street. Dowagers
revel in it combined with lavender and
white. â¢

best. Contrast is allowed in making
the selection, and the hat which ls^
tastefully chosen and which shows a
great deal of contrast is the one that
is the best of all from Dame Fashion"s
point of view.
Select your clothing so that it will en
hance your own natural charm. This
will be the motto in dress for the wom
an of 1901.
The shoes for 1904 will be as remark
able as it is possible for conventional
shoes to be. Though they are far from
being flashy, they are noticeable in
many respects, the most prominent of
which is the height of the heel.
The girl of 1904 will go mincing
through the drawing-room, for it will
not be possible for her to walk in any
other manner. Upon high heels, which
are veritable stilts, she will perch,
while her toes will nestle down into the
toes of pointed shoes that are exquis
itely embroidered with pearls. "White
shoes, bronze shoes and satin shoes
of all colors are trimmed for evening
'with little trimmings which set off their
attractiveness a hundredfold. Upon
the instep of a slipper of black satin
there is traced a little ribbon embroid
ery in pale bronze; and on tha toe of
the bronze slipper there is a little or
nament in the shape of a silvered fig
ure surrounded by worked leaves.
Slippers That Are to Com*.
And there is another type of slipper
which will be fashionable. It to Quite
different from tho embroidered type,
though it has a very high heeL This
slipper is the Priscilla slipper, made of
suede or of glazed kid, but made as
plain as possible. The Priscilla instep,
high and broad with the widÂ» leather
tongue rising over tha Instep, are feat
ures of this kind of shoe.
It Is trimmed with a wide, buckls.
which closely resembles. a bait buckle.
This may be made of steel or It may
be made of gold. Indeed, it can ba
fashioned of any material of which tha
belt buckle is made. And its place Is
upon the Instep of the slipper, where it
makes a glistening spot, bringing tha
foot into pretty prominence.
One of these buckles Is to cut steel.
It Is very wide and quite tall and it is
set on the Instep of a pair of dull black
kid slippers, the heels of whicb are at
least two inches tall and maybe taller.
The stockings with these slippers are
black silk, and they are Inset with
bands of white lace, which reach 'rorav
the foot upward. These bands of laca
are of delicate texture and each one is
embroidered In colors. The embroidery
is as fine as though the stockings were
to be continually on .view. Instead of
merely peeping out above the slipper
top.
And, by the way. the reign of the fan
cy stocking is coming in. Never did
hosiery begin to be half as elaborate.
The r.ew hose are resplendent In em
broidery, say in colors, and remarka
ble for thair fineness of tax tare. In
prices they are absurdly high. Yet thsre
is one comfort always to be obtained
from the thought that a woman can.
at a pinch, embroider her own stock

Perhaps the fashion of 13M will be
very remarkable in that, while elabor

which they differ from the fashions of

Eut Dave paid no heed to these out

"Subtractln*. pa," he gurgled, dab

so as not to forget his total.
"Ah. I see," said pa.
Certainly, the excuse was a feasible
one.
From pent-up forms a roar of boy

tearful and tight as a clam, and away
went hope like the filmy wake of a

Now Stumpy spoke the truth. He
really loved his teacher. School was h"s

tried hard to catch subtraction. But it

because they are taught from the cradle that a thing that cannot be bought
is not worth having; later in life, they find out, in common with less
fortunate mortals, that few things that can be bought arc worth buying.
Steam yachts, private cars, cottages at Newport, daily newspapers and
other diversions of the very rich were playthings to him from his child
hood, and it never occurred to him that such trifles were not supplied
with each and every birth certificate, like a chromo with a can of baking
powder. ,
The elder Luckyfeller had begun life as an office boy plenipoten
tiary and butter-in extraordinary to a retired pirate, who was plying his
old trade under the guise of a promoter of mining â and underminingâ
compani:s in South America. By a diligent attention to business and
the laws that govern human imbecility he had succeeded in acquiring a
large collection of coins of all denominations, mostly large, and an in
teresting case of chronic dyspepsia. When it came to a showdown the
dyspepsia held the winning hand, and the elder Luckyfeller snapped the
tape of his earthly ticker and departed for the land where promoters
cease from troubling and stockholders are at rest. His dutiful son laid
him tenderly but .safely away in a marble sarcophagus that resembled
a maison de canine Â«f the Elizabethan period, and engraved on the
front door the appropriate words, "Here lies," etc., so that it. might be
seen how little death had changed the old man. If the commonly ac
cepted belief' is true that the amount of treasure laid up in the land
to which *Â» is charitably assumed that Luckyfeller Sr. was bound is in
inverse proportion to the store accumulated on earth, it is a safe bet that
he overdrew his account the first day.
As young Andrew grew older and began to accumulate wisdom
and dividends, he discovered that there are only two kinds of women
in the world â those who are married and tlose who are not. These
two classes of females resemble each other in that they are both dis
satisfied with the state in which they find themselves and earnestly de
sire another; they are distinguished, however, by the peculiarity that
the unmarried wish to enter the state of matrimony, while the others pre
fer South Dakota. There are some exceptions, but they were not to be
found in the exclusive and high-toned society in which Andrew moved.
v As soon as it became generally, known that the Luckyteller numis
matic collection was, in need of a curator the rush of applicants began;
soon the string of potentialsacrifices on the altar of Hymen was as. long
as the line of grandfathers on the opening day of the circus. The entire
market of coin curators was thrown open to him and he was given his
choice of the highest product of America's best boarding-schools.: Two
stenographers and a private secretary were kept busy answering invita
tions to dinner and he had enough photographs of reigningâ and hailing
â beauties to furnish all the rooms in the largest college dormitory on
record.
His tastes were studied with an industry, and a perseverance worthy
of a better cause â or a richer man. Did he express a preference for:
blondes, the market price of peroxide of hydrogen jumped three points
in two days, and the increase in golden-haired beauties was so notice
able that the city fathers began to consider the advisability of cutting
down the number r' electric lights.
At this point in the game a girl who wore the unassuming^name, of
Mary took cards. Mary was a' simple little thing just from the country
in the neighborhood of Tuxedo. She wore plain white dresses and
braided her hair down her back and was as oblivious of Andrew's : ex
istence as a cash girl in a. drug store of a fat man waiting for his change.
When Andrew was introduced to' her s.he eyed him coolly and calmly and
then resumed her contemplation of the sun setting behind' the oleander
on the front -lawn. A millionaire appeared to be of no more importance
to her than an income tax to the average j citizen. < -When ' the other I girls
would surround him and begin to throw verbal bouquets at him she
would heave in a t conversation brickbat -, or < two and then 'saunter, out, to
play tag with the children.or eaze on the face of nature.
It was the first, time, that he '; had. ever met a woman who didn't re
solve herself into a reception committee of one' the; first, time 'at bat and
FABLE FOR THE
FOOLISH
the situation impressed him as being unique in the financial bistorv of
his country. Hitherto he had been a seventeen-candle-power electric
arc and all the restVere but moths; with Mary, however, he was only
a two-for-a-cent taper and Mary was the snuffer. It was something new
to him to be able to talk to a woman without keeping one foot on the
floor ready to jump and run at the first sign of trouble. When he
asked her to take a spin with him in his new automobile just to kill
time and anything else that happened to get in the way she dug up a
headache and retired from the field in good order, accompanied by her
maid and a bottle of smelling salts. If he tried to throw up. entrench
ments and sit down alongside the works for a prolonged conversational
siege she would call in reinforcements in the shape of a maiden aunt
whom she had fished out of the matrimonial discard and he would flee in
utter rout. Even his steam yacht failed to soften her adamantine heart
and she treated his Newport cottage with scorn and contumely. The elder
Luckyfcllcr , had often assured him that the stocks that were held the
closest were the real gilt-edged, guaranteed 7 per cent article. If this
valuable maxim could be applied generally Mary was clearly the great
est dividend payer in the market.
This thought gave him fresh hope and the more she froze him the
more he froze to her. until. he was running her shadow a close second as
her steady company. If she consented to allow him to breathe the same
air with her for a few minutes he was bowed down with gratitude, and if
she smiled upon him his heart threw a double back somersault and land
ed on its feet. Finally, having tried all other expedients for making
himself interesting and agreeable, he asked her to share his hand. name,
income, steam yacht, cottage at Newport and also his heart. Much to
his^surprjse she took him up' after making a bluff at thinking it over. It
was .what she had been working for all the time, but he never knew it
and thinks to this day that she married him for love of himself alone. As
' though any one could really love a millionaire that way.
Mary's strong point, of which all truly earnest and ambitious young
women should take note, was that she had discovered by early and dili
gent study: of the /works of the late Mr. Solomon and other authorities on
amateur sport that .millionaires and other shy birds are exceeding wary
of nets that are' snread within the ranee of their immediate observation.

he told her we were engaged: 'Oh. you
idiot! "Why didn't you take Betty?*"
Billy asked himself that question be
fore the party wes over. He pot horn*
an hour before the guests assembled.
Betty was easily far and away the star
of them. All In filmy white, with
strands of dull red coral at her throat
and twined in her golden hair, she was
so ravishing it is small wonder Billy's
callow heart wavered. In the third
waltz he capitulatedâ lest his head
entirely, and was only savad from
making himse!f a pretty spectacle by
Betty's superior poise. Betty was
shrewdly observant â she had read
Hardy's face like an open book while
he waltzed with Milly. So she man
aged It that the four of them, should
meet in a shrubby nook outside the
dancing tent. There things straight
ened themselves, with hardly a word

news of Milly's fortune, the world
heard that she had lost a lover and
gained a brother In Billy Graham.

her bracelet hung Just above the head
of a colled and hissing snake.
"How ever shall I get it?" the girl
demanded. laying her hand appealingly
on his Arm, while Betty looked on

made a strobe or two with his stout
cane, flung away the writhing reptile,
then picked the bracelet out of its green

saying easily. '"There, Miss Morris.

the charm of everything. "That's the

MILLY'S FORTUNE
CHARM OF A MASCOT BRACELET
A Fascinating Half-Hour Storiette
Two years had passed since the moon
smiled gayly down upon. the crowd of
dancers in the old native house, and
to-night it looked upon a similar scene.
Only Kaipo was not among the dan
cers. She stood in bridal robes leaning
against the* tapa cloth by the door.

been told tnat It took a brave man to
face death. It seemed to him just
then that It took a brave man to face
lifeâ his life.
The vessel rounded Diamond Head,
and unable longer to bear the sight
he went below.
Did she think of one who leaned there
two years ago filled with woe and mis
ery? And to-night she was to marry
his iival.
On the southern end of the island of
Oahu lived a native man, and on Kal
po'a wedding night he was walking on
the shore, when he stumbled over an
Inanimate form. Stooping hastily, he
raised the body and dragged it into his
hut. "When the light fell upon the fea
tures he gave a scream:
"Kllawea! Holy mother, how came
you here?"
Recovering from the shock, yet
shrinking not, he forced some whisky
between the cold lips of the leper, and
as the man opened his eyes he waited
in stupefied amazement for Kllawea' 3
explanation.
"Likia you," gasped the thoroughly
exhausted man. "Oh. God Is good when
he sends to me a friend. I have es
caped." he muttered, looking around
fearfully; "escaped from Molokai."
"But, God, man, how? There are
miles on miles of ocean and you had
but a surf board!"
"True, but what is that" to a Hawa
iian? And besides," he said In a chok
ing voice, "it was Kaipo's wedding
night. They told me so two weeks ago.
The curling smoke rose from the
chimneys, the flags fluttered from tbe
steamers in the harbor. One large
transport returning to San Francisco
from "far away Manila was flyini a
long, narrow pennant, the pennant
meaning "Homeward bound." The hot,
scalding tears rushed for tbe first time
to his eyes. A flood of self pity swept
over him. What did those two words
mean to the hundreds of tired soldiers
on board? He thought of the ones left
behind, sleeping neath a. tropical sun
and envied even them. Yet he had

Paradise of the Pacific! Yes, for it
held his Eve, and he was leaving it
for hell!
"Ko, Kaipo," said an officer gently,
"you know it Is impossible for us to al
low you to sacrifice your life and spend
it with him. Kllwea here himself would
not allow It, even if he could."
She glanced at her lover's hopeless
face and finding that all persuasion
was wasted upon the hardened men
she snatched the cigarette from the
leper's mouth and, placing it in her
own, smoked It in utter defiance of the
officers.
At last It was over. The little steam
er pulled out â pulled out with only a
leper on board. Only a leper. Yet he
looked so strong, so young! If she
could only know that he was going to
take that long, long, last mysterious
sleep she would bear it. But thatâ oh
God! She clenched her hands and lean
ed against a post for support. ,
The leper boat rocked idly from side
to side waiting for the stricken. A
woman frantic and ungovernable plead
ed with the stolid officers to allow her
to accompany her lover, dhe clung to
him tenaciously and kissed him pas
sionately in spite of the efforts of the
men to tear her away.

along so softly in the tail grass that he
is not setn or heard. He has no warn

it stupefies the brain and kills the

there is no cure. Natives old and un

and call it the "happy death." But to
the young and strong who see far
ahead of them long years of hopeless

bearableâ what? Those bitten by this
Insidious reptile are carried away to an
Island of their own. On one side of their
settlement stretches the cold sea, on
the other side rises an insurmountable
cliff guarded by unsleeping watchers.
No escape seems possible.
On old grass mats to-day the story of
devotion is told and young native boys
think with envy of a man who could
swim those miles with only a surf
board on which to rest: and maidens
ponder deeply if ever there will be one
with whom they would go away to die
of love and starvation and that one a
Leper Leander.
One hour passed and then another
and the guests grew curious, then
alarmed. A search was instituted for
the bride, but though they searched
diligently and long no trace of her could
be found. The report that Kllawea
was missing reached Honolulu. But it
was generally supposed that he had
drowned himself on Kalpo's wedding
night, though his body was never
washed ashore.
A year passed and Honolulu was
\fllled with strangers. The story of
Kaipo was remembered only by a few
natives. One day an American of a
curious turn of mind, poking around In
some old caves, stumbled upon two
skeletons, one a male, one a female.
Also he found a strange old ring. En
graved upon It was the one word
"Kalpo." The story spread broadcast
of the escape of the leper and how he
had set out to take one last look at his
sweetheart.
He took a step forward expecting his
former sweetheart to raise hue and cry.
but she merely advanced slowly to
meet him with dreamy, fascinated eyes.
"I knew you would come to save mÂ»."
she murmured softly, as he, forgetful
of those long burning days on Molokai,
clasped her in his worthless, though
still powerful arms. Love is mightier
than death.
Suddenly a figure in spotless whit*
stepped full into the moonlight. Ha
was about to run like a detected thief,
when, taklns another look, he recog
nized and was in turn recognized by
Kalpo. He felt the hot blood ru?h to
his head and in that wild pulsation
forgot that bJood was tainted.
and one keeper, he knew, and h!s heart
was not Quite stone. He helped me. no
matter how, to reach the water at

The native nodded. He knew that
Kilawea had been In no danger of

it might seem to others that With a
surf board en which to rest at inter

swim throush the night. By morning
the island of Oahu could be seen and
by night reached.
"With a mighty effort the lad jra'led
himself together. In spite of the entrea
ties of his .'riend. and bested for a suit
of clothes. Heaping a thousand bless
ings upon tbe head of his deliverer, he
set out for the wedding.
As he hastened forward the familiar
scenes sent a twingelng pain to his
heart. Everything here was un
changed, but for him all was altered.
The very trees seemed to cry out "un
clean," and he rushed by in Sf'il'ty
flight. The garden usis reached. Foft,
luxurious strains of happy mu3lc
sounded in his ears in maddening mel
ody. She was within, the center of al!
attraction, and soon would be given
forever to his rival. What If he should
be too late? The stars blinked on as
Inscrutable as ever.

from her bed, her eyes wide with hor

"Yes," said her mother sadly, "and
they say he has known It fo'r a long
time, and they take him away at 5

The girl sank back upon the bed
nearly speechless. At last her lips

L^^StsÂ«eÂ»32vw of the human heart, which cannot, will not, let go of
thoce whom it has once lovÂ«*d and lost. It means or may mean much to
all whose dearest ones have been taken from them, whether they have long
walked a lonely and sorrowing way or whether only last week came the bolt
from the clear sky which has prostrated them with grief.
"Mamma, where do people go when they die?" This question, which
springs to the lips of almost every child as soon as It begins to think at all. Is
Eti'l with us and still unanswered. What would not that merchant prince
who lost the other day the beloved companion of many years give for an
answer? How quickly and i-agerly that young mother who has just laid
away in the grave her baby would fare forth across the seas to distant lands
if she there could find out where her darling is to-day. But no sphinx or
oracle discloses the secret. And I am not so foolish as to think I can give
anything like a definite or satisfying answer, but certain beliefs, or if you
p r efer to call them hypes, are crystallizing into convictions in my mind and
they bear upon the underlying problem and illuminate it to some extent.
One is that the dead are somewhere. The very form of this age-long
question implies that. One a?ks instinctively about the person who has Just
stopped breathing, not "Why has he ceased to be?" but "Where has he
pone?" That strong, commanding spirit who only recently was the most vig
orous among us must still be eomewwhere. In the early days of this coun
try, when people emigrated from New England to the distant West, relying
Eolely on emigrant wagons, their friends who bade them good-by knew that
they might not hear from the travelers for months, perhaps not for years, but
they did not on that account think of them thereafter as non-existent. The.
long wait for us who have lost friends by death; the awful silence seems some
times unbearable, but the greatest wrong we can do ourselves or them is
â¢ to think of : them as anything but living, growing, developing souls some
where in God's universe.
And they are doubtless better off. The apostle Paul thought so at any
rate, and he^seems to have had special information on the matter.' When
we consider the physical and the moral risks to which a human being is sub
ject in this imperfect world from babyhood to. old age, when we reflect upon
the contagion of disease, th* liabilities to accident, .the inherited maladies,
the pitfalls in the path of hlm.who would.be good, when we think 6f man's
inhumanity to man and the large domains of life where cruelty/ tyranny
and lust still hold sway, we can at least hope and 1 expect that the "other
room" into which God takes his children one by,one;is free from some of
the evils that blight .this oarth and that there .the average ,soul is, freer,
"happier and holler. Certainly, all the evolutionary processes and tenden
cies at work in this present world look as If they made for something bet-'
ter and higher hereafter. Helen Hunt voiced this faith In the sweet poem

Mother, I see vou with your nursery flight,

had no charge against him. "Well,
that don't matter." said he. "My word
to Jack Is out. I ain't got no money,

Jack Swilling, robed in buckskin and
looking like tha frontispiece of a dime
novel, glided into my office In Prescott
one June morning more than twenty
years ago, in the custody of a United
Ft?tcs Deputy Marshal, and expressed
a desire to retain me for the defense
in the case of the United States against
Swilling and another charged with rob
bery of the United States mails.
Jack was a Texan, a waif of the Con
federate army, a scout, a hunter and
a rancher, with a large Mexican wife
and a small band of Mexican cattle.
It was charged "against him and his
hired man and companion that on a
difference between the constitution of
a Slate and the constitution of the
United States?" The posted applicant
always replied, "The one is a grant of
power and the other is a restriction on
power." But this applicant had not
been posted, and he answered with dif
fidence. "Well, thar ain't much differ
ence, except that one is a heap bigger
than the other." The Chief Justice
nervously fingered his mustache, but,
anxious to help the poor fellow along,
he propounded the Interrogation in an
other form: "By what right." said he,
"does the Legislature of the Teriitory
of Arizona enact laws?" Now, the
Legislature was in session. , It had
passed several laws in brazen defiance
or disregard- of Its own organic act,
and of the constitution of the United
States.. Its members stood ready at
any time to make, for a sufficient cash
consideration, a bill of sale of the entire
Territory. Its daring and its enterprise
were well known to the candidate; so
with right arm outstretched he ex
claimed In a sepulchral voice, "By the
right, your Honor, of eminent domain."
The Chief Justice groaned and sig
nled to Associate Justice de Forest
Porter that he might complete the ex

which -he had fairly earned, but he
was a braggart, as well as a bravo, and
when in his cups would avow that he
had committed every robbery and
murder that had been perpetrated in
California or Arizona. Yet he was
known to be as honest a fellow as- ever

many, he, had always; on examination,

certain night they had stopped, the
coach near Wickenburg and robbed It
of the express box and several sacks of
mail. The men who accomplished the
robbery were masked. The trail Â¦ of
their horses was traced Into Wlcken
burg, and Jack and his companion were
in Wickenb.urg early next Â¦ morning,
forty miles or more from Jack's cattle
ranch. When news of the robbery
reached Prescott, Jack was drinking
in a saloon and he immediately gave
it out that V he was the robber, but
averred that he got nothing by It, for
he scorned to rob unarmed passengers,

He was admitted.

Apache Indians. Years before one
Colonel Snively was killed on Antelope
Mountain by hostile Indians. Several
expeditions had endeavored to find
Snlvely's bones without success and
finally Jack announced his determina

them. So taking a bag In which to
transport them, when found, he mount
ed his bronco, and" accompanied by his
hired man, departed on the search.
He did not find the bones and that
night, the stage was robbed and this
coincidence,. together with the fact that
the robbers had a bag In which they

occurred in an adjoining county. He
was rearrested and spirited away by
the Deputy Marshal at daylight on
Sunday morning and before a writ of

Incarcerated In the Yuma JalL Year
before Jack had been scalped and his
skull broken in a fight with tha
Apaches. He was trepanned and a sil

him great pain, which he was accus
tomed to alleviate by the use of mor
phine. Either through Ignorance or
malice the Jailer at Yuma withheld
from him his usual doses of morphine
and he died a few weeks later In awful
agony.
Months afterward one of tha perpe
trators of the robbery -was discovered
and confessed and sentenced to four
teen years' imprisonment.
Jack's companion In misfortune came
Into my office one day. travel-stained
and thin as a skeleton. "You heard.**

That Deputy Marshal knew all the time
who It was that robbed the stags and
where to find him. He was In with
them, I guess, and he tried to put It oÂ£f
on Jack and me. Jack died In Jail and
trtey ltept me there until last week;
when they turned me out. I have been
there for months." "Did they pay your

from me when they arrested me and
give back to me when they let me go.
The Judges laughed at the story and
Judge Silent passed the examination
along to Chief Justice French. Dear,
old, honest, esteemed and self-esteemed
Charles Grattan Wilberforce French,
as he loved to sign his name on hotel
registers, had one question which he

The doctor, in order to get his pay,
will sell 500 tickets at 30 cents each,
and when sold there will be a grand
raffle for the remains. TAKE A
CHANCE. The winner can start a
dime museum with the captain.
"Doc. Thompson had a photograph
taken of the captain In his box with
the inscription and sent it to the Chi

he intended to send the Cap. on to the
World's Fair for exhibition as an Ari
zona manufacture. It worked, your
Honors, it worked, and the Doc. got his
money without troubling either the es

This is the Stiff of Captain Jenks,
mummified by order of his
sorrowing relations.

EXHIBIT A
The applicant having served as Pro
bate Judge was supposed to know
something of probate law, and Judge
Silent was willing to help him pass the
ordeal of examination, so he shifted his
base, and the next question he asked
was, "Is the undertaker's bill a claim
against the estate or a claim against
the administrator?" "Against both
until the coffin man gets his money,"
eald the applicant, "but Doc. Thomp
son down to Tucson got his cash
through my advice, when neither the
administrator nor the estate had a
red cent. You see, when old Captain
Jenks pegged out. his relations in Chi
cago telegraphed Doc. Thompson to
embalm the remains. The doctor had
been an army surgeon and he em
balmed old Jenks in good shape, so
that he looked as natural as life and
was as sweet as a nut. The railroad
company would not take the mummy
without being paid fr^i^ht charges in
advance, so Doc. wired the Chicago re/
lations to send en enough stuff to pay
freight and embalming charges. Would
your Honor believe it, them Chicago
relations welched and wouldn't put up
a cent. AH that Jenks had when he
crossed the ridge was fifty cents in
cash and the pallbearers took that
for drinks. Doc. Thompson applied to
me as Probate Judge to have the coun
ty of Pima pay his embalming bill.
Well, I had no right to do that, but I
told him what to do: so he put old
Jenks in a nice varnished redwood case
with a glass front, and he painted on
the front a sign which read:
"What," said Judge Silent, "would
you do if in response to the verified
complaint of your client in an action on
a promissory note, the defendant filed
an unsworn general deniai?" "I would
move for a nonsuit," was the calm re
ply. What he intended to say was
doubtless that he would ask for a Judg
ment for his client. What he did say
was, in effect, that he would dismiss
the case and abandon the claim.
*7y PPLICATIONS for admission to
/ I the bar of the Supreme Court
f~ I of Arizona by examination have
X always been infrequent, as the
demand for legal talent was usually
supplied by importation from Califor
nia or the East. When Phoenix, Ari
zona, some years since, was enjoying
her fiist boom as a sanitarium, a dis
gusted disciple of Biackstone re
marked. "If th:s influx of lungiess and
liveriess lawyers is to continue I mean
to light out. It has got ?o that if one
of toy clients wants a mortgnjre fore
closed, he passes by my office and takes
510 and goes down to the County Hos
pital, ard with it hires one of those
blizzard escapes to do the work be
tween coughing ppells."
The Supreme Court in those days
was seldom strict in its examinations.
Indeed, it was exceedingly complaisant.
At the January. 1SS0. session of the
court, thtre applied for examination a
gentleman who had twice served as
Probate Judge of his county, and who
was supposed to possess some little
smattering of law. He was exceedingly
popular, and relying partly on thi3
fact, partly on his record as a patriot,
and partly on his personal friendship
with the Judges, he applied for admis
sion without having previously burned
any great quantity of midnight oil.

RECOLLECTION AND REFLECTIONS
OF THOMAS FITCH.
14Q. ISITORS strange and jolly have arrived in Pumpkinton,
j >\.' ** And already they the favor of the hosts have fairly won.
U*4 W They are honored guest, at parties and fancy balls and
I And the consideration shown them is appreciated much.
I /Â£ Their names are odd and funny and their disposition
+J^~<J-*JX\ And they are loudly cheered when they appear upon a
<WHifffcrf x street.
A telegram they jointly sent announcing when they'd come,
And Crookneck Squash was chosen to show them Pumpkinton.
Scms came in fancy baskets and some in boxes strong,
And th?y spent their time in merriment, in laughter, play and son s . >
They were greeted tt the station by folks from everywhere,
And the Mayor of the village combed the cinders from their hair.
The very eloquent Grandpa Prune, in a few well-chosen lines,
Extended warmest welcome and hoped they'd have good times.
The visiting delegation had Paw Paw for its head,
And in responding to the welcome he with greatest ieeling said:
"We have come to seethe sights and to have the jolliest fun,
And we know that when we go away we'll all love iPumpkuiton.'*
Crookneck Squash thought out a plan to make a lot of money
And enjoy in all his later days his share of milk and hdney.
He lined the visitors in a row and. made some photographs,
- ' Â¦ â¢
On which they very gladly wrote their funny autographs.
He sold the pictures at high price and demand for them was grett,
And 'tis said Â«the profit netted was a dollar twenty-eight,'
The visitors all were labeled before Crookneck snapped a that.
Thus preserving the identity of the members of the lot. '
The party led by Paw Paw included Cumquat sweet.
He was an orange-like Chinese, quite dwarfish and petite*
Paw Paw explained that Cumquat went well with salad dressing.
And said that to dyspeptics he could always be a blessing.
Another of the party was Senor Avocado Pear,
Who hailed from Porto Rico, where the atmosphere is rate.
:He was big and strong "and husky, and Paw Paw said that ha
Was always quite a favorite at a luncheon or a tea.
Still another vrzs Sapodilla, a mushy sort of fellow,
Who came from sunny Cuba in a suit of brownish yellow.
"Sap," as he was known at home, was fitted, so they say/ /
To drive away rheumatic pains any or rainy day.
'Tis said that down in Cuba land, Sapodilla's in high favor,
And almost everybody likes him and his appetizing flavor.
Chestnut Squash, another of th'e'party led by P. Paw,
First saw the light of day in the land of gallant Thebaw.
He was dainty, sweet and handsome in his suit cf stripes and yellow,
And at dinners boiled or baked he was a most engaging fellow.
Mr.. Jerusalem Artichoke, from somewhere 'way down South,
: Had many eyes and noses, with here and there a mouth.
"Jerush" Was far from handsome, but he had most charming ways.
And was always very popular on big boiled dinner days.
Chili Pepper and "Little Hot,"^bVothers small in size,
Could at almost any time bring teardrops from the eyes.

And often they spend months, and months there on the wall in stria j*

MOSLEM -WEDDINGS IN ENGLAND.

place since the opening of the mosque,
six of them uniting ordinary English
couples who had adopted the Eastern
faith. Three English girls married In
dian barristers and doctors, and two
ladies who were born In England of
Indian parents married Indian profes

Toxteth Cemetery is reserved for Mos

of the Prophet are at rest there.
At first there was great opposition to
the Moslem Mission In Liverpool, but
the personal popularity of Quilliam
with the rough element secured safety,
and now the Sheik's followers hold
their services quite unmolested. There
are no polygamists- among them and
not a single scandal has crept in.

The Sheik was born in Liverpool and

totaler, winning some renown for his
efforts to spread his convictions. Some

declared. "You see, when you've been

"What changed your mind about It,
Miss Redding?" * .
"Well, I determined to read it to. a
friend of mine, who was living in the
room below meâ at the Professional
Woman's League, clubhouse In New

th* matter?'; she said. ; 'It's awful,' I
told "her. 'My play's come and .1 don't;
like it. I want you to hear it.' 'All
right, I'll be the dog,' she said, and sat
down to listen. She's a writer herself,
by the way, and very clever. But she
has one of those cold, immovable faces,
don't you know, and when she sat there
like a statue my heart went into my
boots. Then when It came to that line
â'.Well, I have my mushy. moments like
the rest'â she laughed all over the
place, and I read no more. 'It'll do,' I
said, 'If you can Iau gh. like that *on a
cold, gray morning.' So here we are."
"You get many playlets to read?" '
"Rather!" Miss Redding agreed. . "I
don't know of a house where the acous
tics are so bad for one thing. And one
strains oneself becauseâ well, I've a
feeling that that little fellow at the

"There are better than ours." J
"There's one in Los Angeles, one in
Omaha, one in Kansas City, one in New

The turns are not in the market. The
miserable policy of some -of the East-,

It is understood that Miss Ingeborg
Resch-Peterson, the Swedish singer,
who test Saturday afternoon made. her
first appearance here, was seriously in
disposed at the time. Our playful cli
mate had- affected the singer's -throat
among other unpleasantnesses, and she
Â¦was entlrelx unable to do herself jus
tice. It would have been wiser, and
had Miss Peterson not stood in^ the re
lation of hostess to her audience it
Would doubtless so have been ar
ranged, to have postponed the affair.
Judgment must courteously be reserved
until a more fitting occasion, there
fore,' that one hopes will soon present
Itself. One may say, however, that the
evidences are of a voice of considerable
beauty and cultivation. -Miss Peter
son's" programme was also delightfully
refreshing, some of her native folk
songs and examples of the contempo
rary _Swedish song literature being most
charming./ - ,: ;
Â¦ Miss Peterson was assisted by Miss
Ramus, who fiddlesâ one hardly knows
why-rand by Fred Maurer, who accom
panied/ as usual, admirably. Following
is the programme :
! Aria â "Ave Maria" â¢ (Das : Feuerkreuz)". . . Bruch
Violin aoll â (a)* "Adagio," from Concerto â¢
. Op. 20 .....'.'.*......... :. Max Bruch
much to commend her to favorable at
tention as a singer. She has, a voice,
apparently of some original harshness,
that seems to be well on the way to'
become- a soprano o^~ considerable
sweetness and volume. Her compass
also is a useful one, and Mrs. John
son shows not a little dramatic in
stinct and sympathy in. her interpreta
tions. . Her stage presence,' not un
importantly.- is. unusually engaging.
Yet one .must deplore certain some
what serious errors i in the singer's
work/ -.Her intonation is quite faulty
at "timea, due, apparently, to poor
breath control, the tendency being to
a flatness of pitch. Not impossibly
nervousness' may- have affected Mrs.
Johnson ; here, as her later numbers
were less marred by the tendency. The
singer's attack also lacks certainty,
her enunciation is wanting, in crisp
ness, .her. -.vocalizing in flexibility.
| Of; Mrs. Johnson's ' numbers, she was
possibly most .successful in "The
'Banks of Allan Water," sung with ad
mirable taste ami feeling.; Mrs. John
son seems to have indeed a charming
Instinct for the' singing of ballads.
."Where the Bee Sucks" and "Bid Me
Discourse" were given â with the afore
said technical limitationsâ with consid
erable charm. -The modern songs. with
the exception of, Dr. H. J. Stewart's
"Contrasts." were pleasingly though
less successfully sung. The Von Fie
litz cycle. "Schoen Gretlein," should be
left to the vocal virtuosi. Neither is
there -any particular reason . for them
to rescue it from oblivion. The Tschai
kowsky aria from "Jeanne d* Arc" was
also too heavy for the singer, though
it showed her possessed of dramatic
power and considerable climacteric
possibilities: Dr. H. J. Stewart ac
companied with fine Judgment.
, Assisting the singer was Miss Kath
leen Parlow. the young girl violin st
who is growing up just as good little
fiddlers ought to grow. Kathleen was
In excellent form the other night. She
played' the "Schwedlsche Tanze of
Bruch and the \ Wlenlawski "Souvenir
de Mosdow." The "Tanze," quaint and
fragrant, she contrived to, make inter
esting throughout, playing with even
more than her usual style, authority,
freedom. It will not be long before
Kathleen Parlow's name will be upon
the list of those who are making Cali
fornia famous. I give her from four
to six years with^ proper opportunities.
The young girl is ripe now for a Euro
pean experience, for, the soaking in of
music that- California cannot give her.
There is an enviable opportunity- for
some Maecenas here, though perhaps
the little lady will consider it imperti
nent for me so to sdfcgest. I know,
however, that Kathleen, who, like most
of/the chosen, has more genius than
ducats, is saving her pennies for that
wonderful, Europe. Meantime Henry
Holmes is. seeing to it that she has the
best possible opportunities here. >

into the hall by^ twenty-four members,
senators and ex-presidents of the order,
each carrying an American flag. With
in the council chamber the escort
formed an arch of flags, under which
the visitors, In charge of the usher and
assistant usher, passed to the altar,
where they were formally Introduced and
welcomed. Â«fter which they were es
corted to the stage, the flag bearers
forming a semi-circle in the rear of the

LETTERS OF AN* EMPRESS
DECORATE THE SHELVES
The marriage of Miss Emma Ruther
ford, daughter of Mrs. George Crocker,
to Philip -Kearny will take place at
St. Thomas' Episcopal Church, New
York City, late in January. ; St. Thorn
as* Church has been the scene of many
a brilliant wedding, and the coming
one will be of widespread interest. . In
this sacred edifice Miss Consuelo Van
derbilt became the Duchess of j Marl
borough and Miss Goelct. the Duchess
of Roxburghe. This church is the most
fashionable in New <York, the Goulds,
the Vanderbilts, the Morgans an J the
Miss Belle Harmes owes as much of
her universal 1 popularity to. her sunny
personality as to her good; looks and
artistic gowns. She is" unusually bright
and vivacious and has a -'sympathetic
and engaging manner. ...
â¢ â¢ â¢
When asked the requisites of popu
larity in a girl Mrs. Henry said:
"She should be clever and unaffected.
A figure is important â I mean the one
not associated with the dollar sign.
Money has nothing to do with real pop
ularity. It rests with the temperament
of the girl entirely, although a good in
troduction is very helpful. Beauty will
bring to a girl a large coterie of ad
mirers, but usually the kind who like
to look at her as they would at a pic
ture or marble statue. We often hear
of old maids who are still beauties, but
who do not attract desperate admirers
as does the tactful and clever girl."
Mrs. Eleanor Martin, who is loved or
should be by all who know her and who
entertains lavishly, for the debutantes,
was asked what advice ehe would give
them to Insure popularity. She replied:
"It is difficult to confine them to any
particular mode of action, as they cer
tainly will do Just what they like to do
themselves, yet there are certain rules
, to be observed. Mothers are the best
ones to give them a little loving and
kind advice as to what they ought to
do. Boarding-schools are very good in
their way, but are better adapted to
'education of another sort. I am sure
the young- ladles have \ r ery sweet man
ners, particularly; those in San Fran
cisco, and it is a pleasure to meet them
and to entertain them."
Miss Maye Colburn is sought every
where and her popularity seems easily
explains! by her grace, tagt and gentle
thougbtf ulness for others. She Â¦ has a
;. which money provides, and has every
thing with which to be charming with
| out drawing upon her wits, which in
some Instances might prove inconve
| nient. Her wealth is recognized as part
and parcel of herself, but, strange to
. ray, she does not wish to be married
: for it. although in every other step in
'life there' is a golden tinkling bell on
j, the first step she put forward and the
expected welcome is forthcoming. But
â¢ admiration and love do not always go
' together, and in order to keep the last
ing affection of her friends the society
girl must cultivate the gentler graces
that go with fine feelings. She must be
- sensible, unassuming, sympathetic and
! thoughtful of the happiness of others.
She should find something In people to
â¢ like and be genuinely glad to see them,
for affection will come back to her in
tbe same proportion 6he gives out. Ex
pressed appreciation will be gladly re
ceived, but flattery is an insult to v the
intelligence end prompts more rage
than anything else. >Tx.
Individuality is very important. Let
a girl try to be Just her Bweet self. So
often the majority of the debutantes
smile, bow and eay the same little
speeches in exactly the same way, fit
ting the same pattern, until their words
lose the true ring, and kind remarks
are often mistaken for insincerity and
are inwardly resented. Â¦
The cruelty of cider people in Judging
young girls is sometimes very marked.
They forget that all of their wisdom
comes from the experience of age and
that in their youth they liked silly
things themselves and made the same
little mistakes which they criticize In
the young people of to-day. We cannot
rxpect these youngsters to "show the
wisdom that we have, or ought to ac
quire, witn yeare. â¢
I do not expect girls to know^ every
thing. They may like-to do Billy things,
but that is one of the beauties of their
youth. But there is a great attrac
tiveness in their fresh young faces and
it does one good to see them happy.

with such a eort of sacreflness? Father
ppoke in the same way last Sunday

It is to be hoped that mother accepted
the innocent rebuke for her snobbish
ness.
But money is only one factor In a
Fuccessful social career, and not at all
necessary. Of course, a girl's beauty
is enhanced by a luxurious setting.
Good breeding:, an outward expres
sion <tf an inward grace, is one of the
essentials of popularity and a very
broad one. inasmuch as it includes a
multitude of virtues. Ambitious mam
mas who would have their daughters
a social success would do well to realize
that politeness is only kindness and
unless that gentle consideration and
thoughtfulness for others is inherent
in the nature of an individual no
amount of teaching can Instill it. All
attempts will be as futile as Mme.
Nouveau Riche's offer to buy capacity
for her daughter -when told -by the
professor it was what she lacked. Home
influence and careful training count
for a great deal, and if a girl is so
surrounded early In life she i* certain
to absorb some lasting benefits. We
see young women on every "hand who
are dollarless, but who are eagerly
sought after in society because of their
lovable natures and sweet simplicity of
manner, while sometimes those who
have every advantage of culture, travel
and wealth are merely endured or en
tertained out of cheer respect of their
bank accounts. *

BERLIN, Dec. 12.â The reason Ger

for the present at least, is that the so
cial season- ie about to begin in' Bel
grade and King Peler has issued in
vitations to balls, official entertain
ments and ' other festivities,' as usual
at all European capitals. It is stated
that the Ministers accredited â¢ to Bel
grade have never ceased earnestly, to
advise, King Peter to dissociate himself
from the murderers of his ; predeces
sor and the lattef's , wlf e and to de
mand their . punishment. The Servian
King disregards^ this advice and has
not even answered 'the notes. -
. Affairs reached a crisis when.it was
evident that King Peter intended to
invite the regicide? Ministers, "shake
hands with them and dance with their
wives. Germany, accordingly,, decided
that it was time j for; her Minister: to
take a leave of absence.

LONDON. Dec. 12.â The fact that
King Edward gets through . with so
much work and yet retains unimpaired
his elasticity and vigor has been a
sourceof wonder for. a long time, even
to members of the medical profession.
The explanation of the mystery is of
fered at last. .
j For "amrath cast the King is said
to have been taking electric light baths.
The scientific rejuvenators are installed
in Windsor Castle and in Buckingham
Palace. They are both' of the double
light variety, with a projector of 2500
candle-power for use upon lopal affec
tions of the body. - Inside the bath, in
which a sitting posture Is adopted,
there are fifty-two electric lamps,
which radiate any colored light de
sired. The light not only permeates
every part of the body but has a sort
of. Turkish >ath effect. The lights are
of colors which, scientists say, have
curative effects on certain ailments.
The King was present ,at the Isling
ton cattle show this week and many
were the comments on his well being.
He was one of the keenest spectators
and moved about the pens with an ac
tivity that would have done credit to
a man of half his age..

BERLIN, Dec. 12.â According to the
Saale Zeitung the engagement between
Grand Duke Cyril of Russia' and the
divorced Grand Duchess Victoria Mel
ita of Hesse is encountering serious
difficulties, the Russian Emperor for
bidding it, both on the score of differ
ence in religion and too close relation

firms this.
The young Grand Duke, in spite, of
his father's and the Emperor'* wishes,
persisted in his attentions to his cousin,
with whom he Is desperately in love,
but the Czar would not hear of t It and
his imperial Hfehness faced the alter

or losing both his rank as Grand Duke
and the money which goes with it and
also of having to leave Russia.

has been manifest for many months,
but recently there have been indica
tions that the distrust of the President
has permeated the whole business
community and that doubts of Mr.
Roosevelt's strength as a candidate
prevail 'among Republican leaders,
great and small. No matter what the
Senator may say now, the Hanha
boom, even though it has no pledged
delegates behind it, seems bound to
come to the front again and again
and only to end with the balloting for
President"
The change that has come, over Mex
ico since Porfirlo Diaz first became
President twenty-six years' ago is suf
ficiently shown by glancing over the
history of that anarchial state for the
twenty-six years which preceded his
accession to the office which he still
holds. Between 1S51 and 1858 Arista,
Herrera, Santa Anna, Carrera, Alvarez,'
Comonfort and Zuloaga rapidly suc
ceeded each other either as president or
dictator, and the expulsion of the. last
was followed by three years' civil war,
which culminated in the intervention of
.Great Britain, France, and Spain, to ob
tain satisfaction for the murder and
robbery of their subjects. Then Jol
lowed the brief and unstable empire
under Maximilian, ending in his ( trial
and execution. Afterward Juarez, ai
full-blooded Indian, wart president "un
til his death in' 1S72, arid he was suc
ceeded by Ledro de Tejada; whom Diaz
overthrew in 1877. Even if President-
Diaz disappeared, constitutional gov
ernment is now so well rooted in Mex
ico that, a return to, revolution would,
it may be hoped, be impossibly,âLon

BERLIN, Dec. 12.â The German army
administration believes it has at last
found spectacles which will enable pri
vate soldiers to shoot straight.
It has been quite a problem to in- 1
crease the effectiveness of the firing j
line by having, glasses enabling the j
wearers to see true, .the 'difficulty be- i
Ing that the soldier, is unable to adjust j
his glasses and, often must look \
through the edge instead of the middle j
of the lens. This difficulty is obviated
by the insertion of a special "aiming
lens," which always remains at a right
angle to the line of vision. ,
It was observed during the hot days
of the autumn maneuvers that soldiers i
on the firing line were occasionally j
seen to wipe their spectacles or ,goj
stumbling along In a charge because
their glasses were clouded with per
spiration.

Owing to having to carry such an
immense amount of stores for Ad

Thousands of Women Have Kidney

Almost every one, from personal experience, knows that the effects *of any kind, of severe physical

kidneys are weak or out of order.
The Great Kidney Remedy, Swamp- Root, strengthens the kidneys and through them helps all the
WOMEN suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease is not always correctly understood; in many cases-
when doctoring they are led to believe that womb trouble or female weakness of sonie sort is responsible for their ills,
when in fact disordered kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles. Perhaps you suffer almost con-
tinually with pain io the back, bearing: down feelings, headache and utter exhaustion. \-i

SAN QUENTIN, Dec. 12.â The Board
of Prison' Directors are to thoroughly
investigate the claims made that Frank
Estudillio and Harry McClure, former
attaches of San Quentin prison, have
received money from convicts and have
not turned It In to the Warden's office.
Some convicts to-day declared to the
members of the board that they had
received money from various sources,
turned it over to either Estudillio or
McClure to place to their credit, but
later' found out that it had never been
done. One man asserted that he had
indorsed a draft for $47 50 and gave it
to McClure to keep for him. There is
no record upon the prison books of any
such -transaction. The convict, how
ever, has a registered letter telling that
the money was sent to him, and there
Is some doubt about the testimony of
the confined men.
The matter came up first during the
open session this morning. .Letters
were .read from, John Williams and
Francisca Gardelll stating that they
had given money . to . prison officers to
keep for them, but that subsequently
they ascertained it' had never, been
placed to their credit. The letters called
forth exhaustive discussion from the
members. '
"This is a bad piece of business,"
said 'Chairman Fitzgerald, "and we
must; sift itÂ»to the bottom. We will in
vestigate it and take testimony in open
session this afternoon."
â¢ The board was surprised at the in
formation obtained. Warden Tompkins
also informed the board that'a certain
woman had given money for the pur
chase of books for the library, that the
money had: been turned over, to Mc-
Clure, but that the books had never
been purchased. ,
"Well," said Director Felton,, "I have
investigated this; thing, too, and we
should*.' make i every effort to* ferret it
out., We'can't get McClure, as he is in
Africa^ but Estudillio Is in San Fran
cisco.* â¢ He : should Â¦ be notified to appear
before this board and satisfactorily ex
plain this business, and'the sooner, the
better. Warden ; Aguirre Â¦ is responsible
for his subordinates, too, and should
also be â¢ notified. We are responsible
that; prisoners get their money. . This

board. It la the first time In two years
that I have had any way to find out
how I stand. Jt is bad enough to be
in prison, but to be robbed cf the lit
tle money I had'is pretty tough- About
two years ago last August I save Mc-
Clure $22 25. I was about to leave the
prison on parole and wanted a few
things bought for me, especially a few
yards of cloth. I got the cloth all
right, but from McClure I could never
find out how much balance I had to ray
credit. When he left I asked Estudillio
and he stated I had 10 cents. I could
not understand how the cloth consumed
all my money, so I asked Warden
Aguirre. I could get no satisfaction
whatever from him. I wrote letters to
Aguirre with the same result. I wrota
eight letters to the board, tut never
heard whether they received them or
not." -"
"They were not received," proclaimed
the chairman, "else this matter would
have certainly been looked Into."
sort of business will never do."
Clerk Oliver was Instructed to notify
Estudilllo And Aguirre to appear before
the board at the next meeting prepared
to fully explain.
Francisca Gardelll was the first con
vict to give testimony. He said in sub
stance:
"A long time ago I received a draft
from my folks in Italy for 250 francs,
or $47 50. I indorsed ft and gave it
to McClure to place to my credit. Later
on I received another letter stating
there was an express package for me.
I asked about it and McClure said it
had been received, but that I could not
have it for a few days. In a few days
I asked again. He then said there was
nothing for. me. I was suspicious Just
before McClure left the prison. I asked
about my $47 50. He said it was in
the safe all right. Later I asked about
it and found I had nothing coming to
me." - ; .

The programme 0 of the Harbor
Commissioners to-morrow, as mapped
out by the board's attorney, W. H.
Davis, will be to file an answer and
urge for an immediate hearing. If
this is denied a' motion will be made
to dismiss the temporary . injunction
against the Commissioners. These
proceedings will probably be of signif

In the controversy that has arisen be
tween the . State Board of Harbor
Commissioners and the produce deal

diction of the board.
Yesterday formal complaints were
prepared and filed before the Board
of Harbor Commissioners by Attorney
Davis against the parties whose names
are mentioned in the affidavits of
Messrs. Graves and Fundas as previ
ously published. The hearing of the
persons and firms against whom com
plaint is made in regard to refusal to
sell produce will begin on Tuesday at
10 a. m.
The Board of State Harbor Com
missioners will appear to-morrow by
attorney before Superior Judge' Mu
rasky, prepared to take issue with
the wholesale produce houses that
have been deprived* of their permits
by the board under the Woodward
law. The dealers have secured a tem
porary injunction to restrain the Har
bor Board from interfering with the
sale of perishable products by them,
either on or off the wharves of the
State in this city. Â¦

PLAN FOR LEGAL ACTION
Owing to the depleted fund the board
ordered all consumers notified that the
balance must be forthcoming at once
or the contracts will be annulled. The
deposits amount to about $7000.
Many persons appeared to-day and
offered evidence In regard to, applica
tions for parole.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Dec. 12.â
The State Board of Prison Directors
met this* morning. All the^ members
were present except Robert Devlin. A
large volume cf business was trans
acted. The depleted condition of the
prison fund caused extended discussion.
From the failure of the crops last year
over 1,000,000 Jute bags are on hand and
uncalled for. Upon these a deposit of
10 per cent has been paid, but owing
to their not being called for the prison
fund is short over $60,000. From this
fact a great many expenditures which
should have been made for running the
prison could not be made and many
contemplated improvements essential
to the welfare of the convicts, as well
as for the advancement of the penal
Institution, must be dispensed with un
til money from the sale of the Jute bags
comes In.
The board at Its last session decided
tha.t the bags on hand and contracted
for must be delivered and paid for, or
at least that the balance due on the
same must be liquidated. Consequently
the ranchers who contracted for sacks
were notified to pay the amount due.
This morning many letters from farm
ers were read. They asserted their un
willingness to fulfill the contracts at
this time.

Farmers to Fulfill Contracts

EMPLOYE'S BODY IS FOUND
' . A ' MILE FROM AN EXPLOSION
Â¦ The Democratic Senators held a
spirited caucus to-day to discuss the
advisability of attempting to amend
the Cuban reciprocity bill. They, prac
tically reached the conclusion not" to;
offer any amendments to the Cuban
reciprocity-hill when it. is voted; 1 on tn
.'the Senate next Wednesday. The. cau
cus was called at the instance of the
DEMOCRATS GIVE UP FIGHT.
XEWLANDS ANSWERS DEPEW.
Depew enumerated the revolutions in
Cuba- and IsaliTthat in every one 'of
thesft the /United States, had had a
hand. J . â,..
"And now," said the speaker, the
Senators who have spoken, on the other
side have said that whatever we haye
owed to Cuba" we paid" when we made
the island a self-sustaining nation, and
that if anything. Is owing It Is the grat
itude Cuba should feel for the assist
ance glven-by the United States.'
Teller- declared that Cuba was. not a
dependency. He said the fact that a
treaty "with Cuba is now pending is
proof that it is absolutely Independent.
It Is time that the people of Cuba
should know that we were not trying
to control their conduct, except in their
Interest:
Newlands of Nevada, replying to De
pew, said the planters of Cuba and the
Americans going there would gain con
trol of the island; /that Cuba, without
restricting immigration laws, wqiild be
the refuge of the refuse labor of the
worldâ not slaves, but serfs, he! de
clared, laboring for the great syndi
cates which would control them*. The
only" way- to Americanize the island,
Newlands said, was to take it into the
Union as speedily as possible.
ciay favored the measure. He'con
tended that the sole issue Involve 1 vns
the reduction of the tariff between the
governments of Cuba -arid the United
States. V Â¦Â¦'â¢. Â¦-Â¦ '\. - Â¦ ' . ..
Senator Foster said the sugar bee)
was the natural enemy of the refining
trust and that the effect of the Cubar
bill would-be to injure this growini
enemy of the trust.
"Cuba Is competent, within the lift
of the treaty," said Foster, "to makf
all the sugar this country needs. V
can make sugar more cheaply, and th<
reduction which is made in this treatj
means the slow but sure death of th<
beet, industry and the certain death oi
the cane industry of ray, State. Al
development In this country will . P<
checked. We will never be able to gel
capital to invest in beet, sugar plants
in the West, in the face of the show-
Ing thatcan be made in Cuba. ' [ : . ,
The Senator added as his belief tha
the money of the Cubans was used foi
the' wrongful purpose of misstating th<
facts. In this same connection he spok<
of Thurber as having in his pockets tht
money of Havemeyer for the purpose
of reaching "the best thought." to usÂ»
Thurber's words.
-- WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.â The Senate;
ep^ent more than, five hours discussing:
the Cuban reciprocity bill to-day. Fos
ter "of Louisiana led the discussion and
occupied the greater part of the day
â¢with an argument In opposition to the
measure. He declared that its passage
would, greatly injure if It did not de
stroyÂ£tie sugar growing industry of the
United- States.
'j; Senator Depew on the Republican
eide.'and Senator Clay on the Demo
cratic.' side supported the bill â¢ as a
.measure. In the interest of both coun
tries. Senator Clay said that he ac
ceptejd it as* a provision for the reduc
tion of duties On the part of both coun
tries.)-A.: .
Foster opposed the bill on the ground
that-lts'enactment into law would prove
Injurious to sugar producing and other
Important Interests of the
States. The Senator spoke of the ap
pearance of Thurber of New York'be
fore the Ways and Means Committee,
and declared It was subsequently de
veloped that he was In the pay of the
Military Governor of Cuba.

The Kllery Italian Band has created a

ful if we shall ever have an opportunity
of hearing the rn play again. At any, rate,

The boy was removed to^the McNutt
Hospital yesterday and two nurses
were given him. I>r. Murphy has taken
charge of the case and is receiving as
sistance from the hospital staff. Dr.
McNutt, who was v once a Police Com
missioner, has also interested himself
in the case. The nurses are enthu
siastic and are doing their share to
Eave the lad. No money will be spared
in bringing the boy back to health. Dr.
Murphy has been directed to call in
consulting physicians.
Officer Skelly is happy that the lad
was not killed. He is anxious for the
youth's recovery, and his fellow work
ers are Joining him In strong hopes
"that the boy will pull through. Captain
Spillane is highly pleased with the rec
ords of Skelly and Murphy and has
recommended them to Chief Wittman.
Young King was removed to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital and given
close attention by Dr. James D. Mur
phy. Little hope was given for his re
covery, and brave Officer Skelly was
greatly troubled.
The following day/in company with
Captain Spillane, Policemen Skelly and
Murphy appeared before Chief Witt
man. The latter had been informed
that the lad had died, and told Skelly
so. Skelly burst out crying and Mur
phy turned as white as a sheet. Cap
tain Spillane tried to comfort his brave
men and Chief Wittman acted splen
didly. He told both men they had per
formed their duty and need not fear
censure for doing so. He commended
them for their bravery and succeeded
in relieving the anxiety. of the pair.
Later on it was learned that the boy
was alive, and Immediately the fellow
officers of Skelly and Murphy' at the
Southern statioi* took an Interest, in his
welfare. They not , only visited the
youngster, but sent him flowers and
dainties. They learned that the family
of the boy was poor and lived In their
district. The mother of the lad had died
three months ago, but an aged father
and two smaller children relied on the
small pittance George earned, and the
policemen did everything they could to
help the old man and the little ones.
A committee from the assembly-room
v.a'ted upon Captain Spillane and asked
that the officers, be allowed to subscribe
a sum to be used in bringing the lad
back to health and strength. The cap
tain was delighted to see his men act
so nobly and he approved the plan. He
also asked leave to subscribe, and was
followed by the officers next in com
mand.'- .->Â¦;:
GIVEN EVERY COMFORT.
CHARITABLE POLICEMEN'.
The prospect for, the recovery of lit
tle George King, the boy who was
accidentally shot by Police Officer
Skelly while in pursuit of a burglar,
ffrows brighter every day and the doc
tor In charge says that It Is almost
certain now that George will be re
stored to health. This has brought
Joy to Policeman Skelly and his fel
low officers of the Southern station
are also Jubilant. The big hearts that
beat beneath the blue coats of the
peace guardians have been stirred to
all their charitable depths by the un
usual case and hearty aid will be giv
en the boy by the sympathetic police
men. Everything they can do to as
sist his recovery will be done by them.
The chase after the robber. Harry
Howard, during which the boy was
shot, was a sensational one. Howard
entered a saloon on Howard street,
held ud a crowd of men, relieved
them of their valuables and started to
run toward Fourth street. Skelly was
told of the robbery and pursued the
criminal. Howard slipped down and
drawing a revolver snapped it at the
officer. The latter nred a shot, which
did not take effect and Howard ran
into a doorway. Skelly shot at him
as he did so and dodged Into a door
way himself. The bullet struck How
ard in the leg, then hit the cement
sidewalk and, glancing, struck young
King, who fell. Howard ran again
and was grabbed by Police Officer
Murphy, whom he also tried to shoot.

NO OPERATIC
STAR ACCUSED
The second event was damage done
to the" 'railway track by heavy surf
along the north coast of Oahu. These
were evidently tidal waves, since no
surf proper could possibly reach so
high above the beaches of that coast.
The third was the Inundation by
tidal waves November 29 of the vil
lage of PeJekunu, on the north coast
of Molokai. Neither of the two tidal
inundations reported were violent
enough to do great damage, although
long continued, thus proving that they
were inundations transmitted from
seismic disturbauces thousands of miles
away. The direction of these distur
bances was from the north. The source
of them was therefore not in Japan.
Also had it been there the cable would
doubtless have reported it.
Hawaii's two volcanoes are both in
active operation, Kilauca having brok
en, out as a counter attraction to Mo
kuaweoweo at the summit of Mauna
Loa. The volcano at the Hop of the
mountain burns steadily all night,
sending up a straight column of fire
anld illuminated smoke. Halemaumau,
in the Kilauea crater, Is also brilliant.
A lake has formed in the bottom of
the crater and the inrushing: flood of
lava e"an be heard nulte a distance
from the edge. Above the red hot
cracks, which are a marvel of the Kila
uea crater, can be heard the swish of
rushing lava beneath. The whole north
ern section, of the crater of Kilauea
shows a rising temperature.
The first was a peculiar record made
by the tide gauge in Honolulu harbor,
showing the presence of a tidal wave
oscillating the sea, probably from seis
mic disturbance across the ocean, as
has repeatedly occurred, usually caused
by violent earthquakes in Japan, also
once from the Krakatao eruption in the
Straits of Sunda In 1883.
HONOLULU. Dec. 6.â Dr. Sereno E.
Bishop, who for half a century has
studied climatic and atmospheric con
ditions in the- Hawaiian group, thinks
that a violent volcanic eruption iii the
Aleutian Islands is responsible for the
recent tidal waves here.

Herr Doeme is ill in Dr. Bull's Sani
tarium and his friends were not per
mitted to visit him to-day. His coun
sel. Edward Lauterbach, said:
"Herr Doeme is the victim of a great
Injustice. He is an artist and a man
of vivid sensibility. He therefore feels
his situation keenly and Is really 111.
I have filed his answer to his wife's

NEW CITRUS GEOVES.
The Modesto Herald says that a
forty-acre orange and iemon orchard
will "be one of the winter's .develop
ments in the Modesto irrigation dis
trict. It will be set out by Israel C.
Ewing of Oakland."
"Sfever before." says the Visalia
Times "'in the history of Lirdsay, has
the oran&e crop been moved as fast
as durins this season. Lindsay is a
busy place, with her six packing-houses
in operation. The Citrus Union
has more than 300 persons em
ployed in its two houses herÂ«^ and the
two in Porterville. At this place they
are putting out an average of nine
carloads of oranges per day. Next year
a large acreage of new trees will come
in bearing, which will demand increased
facilities for handling the crop."
Twenty-four carloads or tourists ar
rived at Los Angeles in. one day re
cently. The Los Angeles Herald quotes
one of the hotel-keepers as saying: "I
see the railway companies are kicking
because they cannot get their rails from
the shops, but they have not the least
idea how we are handicapped. If I
knew where I could get a dozen car
loads of rooms 1 would have them sent
to this city by express. We have had
to turn ajvay a lot of business, .as we
have our regular trade which must be
cared for, and on top of it all the rail
ways are bringing In thousands of peo
ple each month and we must care for
them."
In the presence of 500 Chinese Gee
Ah Gum was slain by a highbinder late
last night. The tragedy occurred . on
the stasre of the theater on Washing
ton street and whlle'a performance was
on. The assassin entered from the rear,
stepped up to his victim, who was play
ing a musical instrument, and fired five
shots. Three of the bullets took effect
and the- injured man rolled from his
seat and was dead in five minutes.
Firecrackers were first exploded by
those who designed the murder, that
the police might be misled.
Confusion followed. The murderer,
with the smoking revolver in his hand,
rushed through the dressing-rooms and
made his escape through a rear alley.
The audience arose with one accord
and started for the main entrance. So
great was the scramble that several
were trampled on, and it was not until
the arrival of the police that the great
rush of humanity was stayed. Shoes
and slippers were lost in the scramble
and when the excitement subsided the
floor was littered with them. The act-,
ors deserted the stage and the wounded
man lay all alone, gasping and squirm
ing with pain.
The friends of Gee Ah Gum say
that he is an innocent victim of the
fierce tung war now raging between the
Hop Sings and the Sen Suey Yings.
They disclaim any connection with
either faction and will not reveal the I
identity of his slayer. The police who
are on the case say that he was a
member of the Suey Yee tong and that
a Wy Ting tong man shot him to
death. The occasion of trouble^ be
tween these two tongs is not apparent.
Last night an effort was made by the
Chinese Six Companies to settle the
trouble between the Hop Sing tong and
the Sen Suey Ying. Little was -accom
plished at the peace conference, the
Sen Suey Yings claiming that their ad
versaries had scored one more murder
than they had and tha't the fight must
continue until things were evened up.
For this reason it is believed that the
Chinese who fell in the theater last
night was, or was mistaken, for, a Hop
Sing tong man.

tics under the famous "King" Mc-

HONOLULU, Dec. 6. â Solomon Me
heula. Clerk of the House of Repre
sentatives, has had two indictments
presented against him for destruction
of vouchers by the Federal Grand
Jury- That he was the only one In- j
dieted is simply because the looting
of the treasury, shown up by the ''
Grand Jury, does not come within the
fcope of the federal law to punish.
By MetienbTs official position, that
made him the custodian of public rec
ords, he became amenable to the stat
ute of the United States provided for \
safeguarding such documents. When
it was found that he had paid out
more than Â£1000 without having:
vouchers to show authority for the ex
penditure, the duty of the Grand Jury
was to investigate whether or not
there had been vouchers for the items
in question and if so what had become
of them.
With regard to the receiving: of pub
lic money by others than the clerk,
for which either no services or only a
mere pretense of service had been
rendered, the Federal Grand Jury was
compelled to pass the facts on to the
Territorial authorities for jurisdiction
as coming under the Territorial laws
urainst embezzlement, larceny, gToss
cheat, or whatever law, in any par
ticular case, applied.
In each indictment against Solomon
Meheula it is charged that he, being
a public officer, namely, clerk of the
House of Representatives, t having the
custody of records, documents and pa
pen of the House of Representatives,
did have in his possession a certain
voucher. The number of a particular
warrant is then given, with the
n mount for which it was drawn, and]
then the indictment specifies how the:
accused committed a violation of sec- i
lion 5408 of the Revised Statues of the !
United States.
The pecond Indictment against Me- j
heula, in similar form, charges him on |
tlire* counts with having destroyed I
vouchers for $30, $33 and $60 respec- !
lively. In each count of both indict- ;
merits it is set forth that Clerk Me- 1
heula was paid the money for himself |
by the public Treasurer.
The Federal Grand Jury expresses j
its opinioijjof legislative grafting In the
following terms:
"This Grand Jury was astonished at I
the si>ectacle presented by a body of j
men selected by the electors of the Ter- Â¦
ritory to perform neither administra
live nor executive, but legislative func- ;
lions, granting: the right to an indi- ;
vidual not a member of that body to ,
authorize the payment out of the jnb- j
lie treasury of $50,000 and in no way i
providing for the proper recording of J
financial transactions or at auditing the ,
accounts thereof, or of finally deposit- j
ing such accounts with a public officer.
And this Grand Jury is of the unan
imous opinion that the honor of the
Territory and its representatives and :
the economic management of its fin- !
antes demands the enactment of such Â¦
a law or laws as shall properly regu- :
'late and control the expenditures by I
future legislators."
The Territory may get back a share !
of the legislative graft in the form of j
income tax.
James H. Hakuole. cashier in the or- j
fice of the Collector of Internal Reve- j
nue. has been indicted for the embez- i
zlement of $164. It is reported that a j
further shortage has been discovered in j
Hakuole's accounts, being of collections j
outside the office, since the Grand Jury I
investigated his case.
The Territorial Grand Jury has in- j
dieted H. C. Birbe Jr. for profanity at j
the polls on the day of election. Birbe ;
was an insrÂ»ector in the "Fighting Sev- j
enth" Precinct.

PERSONAL.
The joint committee of Police, Fire
and Streets of the Board of Super
visors yesterday recommended that
the petition of the Pacific States Tel
ephone and Telegraph Company for
an extension of fifteen months' time
from January 12, 1904, within which
to comply with the terms of the or
dinance reguUUing the placing of high
voltage wires on poles, so that life
may. be safeguarded, be granted. The
committee also submitted a form of
ordinance granting the extension of
time. . . Â¦
From the testimony adduced at the
meeting of the committee it was as
certained that the telephone company
and the Independent Electric Light
and Power Company are the ' only
concerns affected by the provisions of
the ordinance regulating the placing
of wires that proceeded in good faith
to comply with its provisions-. â¢
The work of the telephone company
has been delayed by a strike of its
linemen lasting through several
months. The assurance was given by
the' representatives of the company
that the work will be completed with
in the time granted by the extension.
Some fear was expressed by the
representatives of the Linemen'sUnion
present that the grant of the exten
sion of time to the telephone company
might affect the validity of 'the' main
ordinance in so far as it applied to
other companies subject tp its terms.
The committee, however, ~ expressed
its belief that if any action of the
board 's invalid in ' that regard it
would be .the grant of extension of
time and the telephone company
would alone be the sufferer, v/
General Manager Lawless of the
San Franciseo Gas and Electric Com

the entire work, so far as his com
pany : was concerned, would be com
pleted within fifteen months. W. It.

"A COMMON COLD."
"The history, literature and therapeu-
tics of the condition known as a 'Cold'
shows conclusively that very little has
been known in regard to this state.
"Who has not witnessed the many fail-
ures of a 'good sweating,' a dose of 'cas-
tor oil,' etc.? The fact is, we have been
overlooking the true origin of the fdis-
eased state known as a 'Cold.' It is, pri-
marily a disease of the stomach, a de-
rangement of the processes of gastric di-
gestion." â Medical Times.
The use of Dr. Humphreys'. "Seventy-
seven" breaks up the Cold, and if alter-
nated with or followed by the use of Spe-
cific No. 10 the stomach will perform its
functions and the gastric' derangement
caused by taking cold will be corrected.

Sixth Street 957 T^ 977 "k \CUTKCI Oireet - till X-masNEW YORK, Dec. 12.â The Finan
cier says: One notable feature of the
official statement of the New Y*ork as
sociated banks last week was the
close correspondence between the gain
in cash, as shown in the returns, and
the = estimated increase, as estimated
by the traceable movements during
the week. The specie shows an in
crease of $722,000, while the gain in
legal tenders "was $1,039,500, making the
total increase in cash $1,761,500; the
estimated gain was $l,9$5,S00, or $224,-
S00 greater... The smaller increase in
specie- than in legal.' tenders was as
hag been' the case in previous weeks
niost likely due to the transfers to New
Orleans through the sub-treasury, de
posits therefor being made in. gold;
these transfers to a great extent off
set receipts of gold from abroad and
from domestic sources. The deposits
\howed an unusually small change,
and. instead of there being an increase
of $653,000, as called for by the sum of
the gain in cash less the decrease in
loans, there was a .reduction Of $14,000
In deposits; therefore the" statement
failed to balance.. The decrease in re
quired reserve, resulting from the re
duced deposits, was $11,175, adding to
which the gain In cash makes 51.772,673
as the increase in. surplus reserve,
which item now is $8,0Tf.975. Calculated
upon the basis of deppsits less those
of $36,80S,70O of public "funds, the sur
plus is ?17,r80.150. I-Oans were de
creased $M0S,500, whereas In the pre
vious week they , were augmented by
$1,162,600. ThÂ« reduction this week
was probably due to cancellations of
loans on stock collateral. Bank condi
tions, so far. as regards reserve, are
much better now than they were a year
ago, though the surplus is about equal
In amount because of the prospect that
very eoon the cash reserve .will begin
to be augmented to a greater extent
than recently through- th6 receipts of
gold from abroad. There will also
probably be â¢ an increase in cash
through the return movement of mon
ey from the- West. Some reduction in
cash is looked for during the current
week because of withdrawals from thtÂ»
banks for holiday requlremenio, and
also because of the accumulations of
money vby large concerns in 'antlclpa-.
tio-;Â» of the making up of their annual
reports. But- this contraction of cash
reserve should cause no apprehension,
for whatever money Js withdrawn for.
the abova menMoned holiday purposes
will be promptly j returned. ThÂ» . avcr
ege dall.v clearings of: the bankB* last
week were $221.000,000,. and those on
Saturday/reflecting Friday's business,
were- $234,547,865, or $13\:>0O.OQ0 above
the daily average. Comparisons f of
changes' in the item of loans 'by- indi
vidual' banks, show net losses, by tuyen.
of the larger institutions of $2,200,000.
The net. cash loss by five banks was ;
$1,200,000. .- '

NEW YORK, Dec.13.â The stock mar
ket was irregular and rather dull to
day., but the reactionary tendency pre
vailed-. There "was no perceptible re
sponse to new causes in the movement
which represented the working out of
speculative contracts. Some support
was accorded to United States Steel
preferred, and this had a sentimental
effect on the general market* The ad
vance In that stock, however, encoun
tered fresh selling, and the ; bears did
not show great uneasiness. Profit tak
ing in Brooklyn .Transit Was conspicu
ous and cost that stock nearly two
points at ope tlmft There was pressure
against Pennsylvania, and . the bears
resorted to the device of offering the"
dividend on a limited number of shares'

in many weeks, New York clearings
having risen over last year, with dom

verse criticism of eome of the combi

modified the conviction of an Improve

better things in the future. Even In
the Iron and steel trade the further
Indications of the enormous contrac

The November return of domestic ex
port shows the greatest' value for cot
ton exports for any month in the his
tory of the country. The declining
value of the country's Imports Is no
less significant in the explanation 'of
the course of >he foreign exchange mar
ket and the persistent inward move
ment of gold, notwithstanding the" em
ployment of devices by jforelgn, banks
to protect their gold holdings. The de
cline In prices of our commodities war
rants' the . expectation that the decline
In Imports will continue, puts 6ur
manufactured products on a basis to
compete better in foreign markets,
thus promising a growth in manufac
turing exports. Organized .efforts, are
being made to extend the foreign mar
kets for Iron and steel products- espe
cially. 'The extraordinary outward
movement of cotton invites the>-cOm
parison with the great expor 1 , â¢ move
ments of wheat a few years ago. IThe
enormous trade balance in our f avor
thus built up was an important ele
ment In the era in expansion which fol
lowed. It will be remembered that for
eign holdings of our securities " were
swept home in a flood as a result, and
American holdings in Government se
curities were largely extended In the
struggle to adjust the balance. Then
followed the tremendous outpouring of
tiew capitalization which it became the
important Item of the time to absorb.
In the struggle to take care of the com
mitments made at that- period, includ
ing the formation in United States
Steel Corporation and the Northern
Securities Company, the American
holdings of foreign government securi
ties were sent back to the home mar
kets to release the resources. In addi
tion our indebtedness to foreign lcnd
cre was run up to a figure variously
estimated, lÂ»ut which was generally to
represou I ihe . highest figure . ever
Â¦reached r hy our t foreign^ floating: debt.
The. decline in -bur t-xports.lof ;jner
chficdlt-e and the foj-f
lowing upon the expansion"' perioci here
resulted in a scanty supply of exchange
and added to the burden of the repay
ment of the foreign indebtedness car
ried by Aniefican finance. The long- '
continued liquidation which followed
here- and 'the severe -sacrifice involved
are known to ha\'e been due in no
small part to the necessities of meet
ing these foreign obligations, as shown
by the high level maintained by the ;
loans of our banks in face of the vio- |
lent liquidation of securities. The'ef-:
feet of the new turn in the lnterna- .
tional trade situation must receive im- I
portant consideration. |
The bond market hasM)een active and i

from the closing call of last week.

paintings and sculpture of the artist
members of the Bohemian Club,
which lasted from 2 until 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. Admittance was
by. card. All afternoon the jinks room,
where the exhibition is being held,
was crowded almost to the ijoint o.f
discomfort, principally by ladies- of
the fashionable world and lovers of
art. . A constant stream of viewers
wound their way around the room,
enjoying the beautiful display of
paintings and sculpture.
All voices were raised, in praise of
the excellent workmanship displayed.
Among the canvases greatly admired
was one of Willis E. Davis, called
"Orange County Hills." whlch-is a de
lightful, mountain effect and one of
the gems of the exhibition. He has
also three other canvases of unusual
merit. . . .

i NEW YORK, Dec. 12.â United States
j Senator Clark of Montana, who has
j twice been operated on for a diseased
I condition of (he ear and adjacent bony
i tissues, was to-night, according to his
i physicians, resting easy. By the 6ec-
I end operation, performed Wednesday,
Jail the diseased portion of .the ..mastoid
process was removed and Dr. Holbrook
i Curtis end Dr. Lewis Rutherford Mor
j ris said to-night that the operation was
considered completely successful and
that they did not expect that the sup
puration would again manifest Itself.
i Senator Clark probably will be able
â¢ to leave his bed, said Dr. Curtis to-
I night, in about three weeks unless un
! looked for complications intervene.
Drs. Curtis and Morris to-night de
; scribed Senator Clark's ailment and its
i progress as follows: On Wednesday of
I last week Senator Clark contracted a
I cold with grip symptoms and pharynx-
I gitis. On Friday his left ear became
j very painful and he consulted Dr. Cur
i tis, who performed the operation of
j slitting the ear drum to allow the es
i cape of the liauid exudations In the
I typanitic cavity. This relieved the ex
cessive pain, but microscopic examina
tion Â°* t * le discharge showed'a virulent
infection and suppuration.; High tem
| perature was present, and on Tuesday
j night Drs. Curtis and Morris called Dr.
j Mackernon into consultation and It was
! determined that the Infection had ex
! tended to the mastoid bone, which lies
i behind the ear. An operation was
j deemed advisable. On the -follpwlng
j day, Wednesday, the naptoid operation
Â¦ was perfected by Dr. Curtis, assisted
I by Drs. Mackernon, Colem, Morris and
I Denton. Drs. Delafield and Ely* had
! previously examined Senator Clark.
"The operation consisted in removing
the eÂ».d of the mastoid and cellular
bony tissues within the mastoid cavity,
[a larte section of the mastoid being
I chiseled off. Since then the Senator's
j temperature has fallen, the dressings
! have been changed several times and
I there has been no indication of a re
newal of the suppuration."

THE VALUE OF. CHARCOAL
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that charcoal Is thÂ«
rafCKt Â«nd' rooÂ»t efficient disinfectant and puri-
fier ln nature, but few realize Its value when
taken Into the human Â»yÂ«tem for the same
cloiiising purpose.
. Chaicoal Is a remedy that the more you take
of it the better; It Is not a drug at all, but
Kitr.ply aVscrbs the cases and ltnr>rrlttes al-
ways :tÂ«fnt in the stomach and Intestines
end ccrriea them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after smoking,
drii.klnic or after eating onions and other odor-
ouc \>:KPtfctIes.
Charcoal effectually clears'and Improves, the
coir.piexit.fc/. It whitens the teeth and further
acts as a natural and eminently saft cathartic.
It t.bsor)>Â« the Injurious Rases which collect
lr. the stomach and bowels; It disinfects the
mouth and threat from the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal ln one form or an-
oihtr. but orobablv the best charcoal and the
most fcr, the money Is In Stuart's Absorbent
LoseaSW -they are composed of the finest pow-
dered Willow charcoal and other harmless an-
Useptkv In tablet form or rather ln the form
cf large, .pleasant tasting lozenges, the charcoal
belnj mixed with honey.'- . , Â¦
The riailv use of these lozenges trill soon
tell ln a 'much Improved condition of the gen-
eral health, belter complexion, sweeter breath
and purer blood, and . the beauty of It is that
no possible narm can result from their con-
tinued use. luu on the contrary, sreat benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of the bene-
fits' cf charccal Vays: ' "I advise Stuart's A b-

complexion and "ourlfy"thÂ« breath, mouth ana

twenty-five cent* a box at drug stores, and al-
though In some sens* a patent preparation, yet
I believe I ret more and : better 1 charcoal ln

bankers and the Elks did not 'meet" on

the condition of the grounds the game
of baseball has been postponed until

Baseball Game Postponed.
OAKLAND. Dec. 12. â Judge* Ogden
decided the suit brought by Mrs. Ju
lia Hayes, to compelher mother, Mrs.
Anna Hughes-Barnes,' to deed to her
property to the value" of $25,000 at
Twelfth and Jefferson streets, in favor
of the mother to-day. The daughter
claimed that her mother had deeded
her the property and put the deed in
the hands of a third party to be flled
in case of her death. The mother
afterward changed her mind and de
stroyed the deed. .
Mrs. Barnes gained considerable
notoriety some time ago by marrying

Berkeley team was accredited with
having made the best speech and- the
Berkeley boys also won on argument.
The question was, "Resolved, That
a democratic form of government is
adapted to the people of France." and
the winning team upheld the affirma

Judge Easkin to-day fixed the- date of
the execution of Pleasant Armstrong,
who murdered Minnie Ensmlnger last
Christmas eve, for January 22, 1904, in
the Jailyard of this county. 'The Su
preme Court will be asked for a stay
of proceedings until it can be deter
mined whether there is any law under
which he can be executed.
The authorities of this county are
placed in a peculiar situation regarding
Armstrong's execution and' he may yet
escape punishment entirely. Armstrong
was convicted under a law which re
quired all sentences for murder O. be
executed at the county seat, and was
auly sentenced to be hanged May S,
1903. His case was taken to the Su
preme Court on errors, and pending
its hearing a stay of execution was
granted.
In the meantime a new law went into
effect requiring all executions for mur
der to take place at the State peniten
tiary. Armstrong's attorneys contend
that he cannot be executed under the
old law because it had been repealed.

A CORRESPONDENT who describes himself as
one who has been "a trade unionist for near upon a
half a century" writes to say that a great deal of
the strife between labor. and capital of late j'cars is due to
what he calls a "'contemptuous treatment" of the appeals
of workingmen when made to the heads of great corpora
tions.
His statement; which is well worth noting, begins with
a cordial approval of a recent editorial in The Call on
"Unfortunate Cripple Creek," but' takes exception to the
assertion made therein that "there are plenty of capital
ists, and of corporations too, for that matter, who if they
were approached in a proper spirit of fair mindedness,
would only be too glad to meet the demands of labor in
an open, honorable, straightforward manner, perfectly
willing to live and let live."
In stating his objection to that portion 'of the editorial
the writer says: "With the exception of the portion quot
ed I was in entire accord with the writer of the editorial.
I have been a trade unionist for near upon a half a cen
tury and often has it been my duty to wait upon em
ployers touching the matter of wages and such other mat
ters as from time to time come to the front in the labor
world, and I have* this; to' say: I" never 'untii just recently
met with the least .discourtesy,' not to say contempt.
The recent exception has been sn overwhelming in the
contemptuous treatment' of the. workmen's appeal" for a
little consideration during these good times that it Â¦has
left in the breasts of employes just what might have
been expected by any sane manâ nothing but contempt
for employers and their interests."

rr-* HE splendidly endowed institute at Washington to
I promote the highest forms of scientific research and
Â¦Â¦" established by Mr. Carnegie as the greatest of his
monuments has declined to include within its purposes
the plant creating work of Mr. Luther Burbank. Such
inclusion was urged, by Presidents Jordan and Wheeler
and many other. influential scholars and men of science.
We are persuaded that the refusal is made because the
organic plan of the institute does not permit it to include
such work as Burbank's and not because its recognition
and support is unimportant or unnecessary. All of his
active life Mr. Burbank has worked in the improvement
of horticulture with his own means and without any offi
cial assistance or recognition. Yet it is such work as
other Governments delight to encourage and support.
The world is just learning of the remarkable discov
eries in soil feeding and" the relation of beneficial mi
crobes to plant life carried on by ProfessorNobbe in the
Agricultural School of Saxony. With ample means sup
plied to support his experiments he has discovered the
office of; the nodules on the roots of leguminous plants
and their origin in microbe action^ Their function is to
promote the plant's absorption of nitrogen from the at
mosphere. He has found it possible to feed these mi
crobes- to soils that are exhausted of their nitrogen,
thereby causing , nodular development, and enabling
plants to feed on nitrogen and digest it, so transmuting
it into development of a crop. It is probably one of the
greatest discoveries in vegetable nutrition that has ever
been made.
But Mr. Burbank's work in plant physiology is of no
less importance to the food supply of the world. We
have .become accustomed by long use to the improve
ment of animal life by crossing strains and by develop
ing individual traits into general characteristics. In this
way our breeds of butter cows have been. developed from
an excess of butter fats in the milk of individuals, and
our cheese: cows from individual excess of casein, until
we have neat cattle in whole races and great numbers that
can be relied on for butter or cheese purposes. In like
manner our beef producing breeds have fieen differenti
ated by building on the quality of individuals.
Mr. Burbank has applied this to vegetable physiology
and anatomy. He has proved it possible to have im
proved breeds of cereals, tubers, bulbs and fruits by
hybridizing and by building on individual qualities. In
this way. he has improved the varieties of vegetable and
all plant life and increased productivity. His work has
been magnificent in its magnitude, and much as he has
accomplished he is at the gateway of much more. In
another country he would have been long ago knighted
and pensioned. Here he has worked alone, and his
shy and bashful and modest personality is little known
even to his fellow-citizens in California. The name of
the man who discovered the' mule as a hybrid is pre
served for all time in the Book of Genesis. , But here is
a hybridizer of plants, who has increased the food supply
of the world and has verily painted the lily by giving it
new glories that nature did not put upon it originally,
who is rarely recognized a's he goes and comes among us.
The Carnegie institute is open to original investigation
in chemistry and physics over all their vast field. It in
cludes the biologist, the astronomer, the t psychologist^
We hope its organic purpose may be enlarged to include
the inventor of new plants and the man who teaches
nature how. to usefully amend her work.
BURBANK AND CARNEGIE.
While a number of Superior Judges
were eating lunch a few days ago they
discussed the Idiosyncrasies of the law
yers prominent in the local courts. One
of the Judges, who has been on the
bench a number of years, told the fol
lowing on a lawyer whose penchant for
borrowing car fare, always "because
he had left home in a hurry and for
got his purse," had been commented on
more than once by his fellow practi
tioners.
"It was about two weeks ago," said
the Judge. "I was walking down Mar
ket street, and when near the corner of
Sixth saw this lawyer crossing the
street. I saluted him and we stopped
and chatted a few moments about the
weather and se'veral trivial subjects.
Just as I was about to leave him he
said, 'By the way. Judge, I left home
in a hurry this morning and forgot my
purse. Could you let me have car fare?'
'Certainly,' I said, searching in my
pocket for a quarter. I found one, and
had just handed it to him when a
young man, evidently a collector,
stepped up and presented a bill to my
friend. 'This will save me a trip out
to your office,' said he.
â¢ "Without so much as a blush my
friend paid the bill. It amounted to
.$7 60, and he abstracted that sum from
a well-filled purse he took from his
hip pocket." !
'A Forgetful Lawyer.
Awed by the strains of that musical monstrosity, "In
the Good Old Summer Time," an Indian maiden, buried
in the everlasting snows of Alaskan winter, sent an ex
pedition of obedient swains one thousand miles to get
the tune. What an opportunity here presents' itself to
one who loves his fellow-men. If Carnegie would only
suspend the library habit, buy all the copies of the song
in existence* and send them to Alaska.
"The first venture proved a succes3,
and others hurried into the business.
Ten years later the whole coast of
Maine was stripped of firs and the
business moved inland. From thi3
beginning the trade ha3 grown until
now a million and a half of Chirstmas
trees are sold every year in Xew York
and' New England, of which about a
million come from Maine alone."
"It Is natural for us to take it for
granted that there have always been
Christmas trees, yet fifty years ago
there were few in America, save in
the homes of foreigners," says a Â¦writ
er in Country Life in 'America, "About
thirty years ago a number of duck
hunters cruising along the coast of
Maine noticed the millions of young
balsam firs which grew along the
shores, and the brilliant idea occurred
to one member of the party that these
symmetrical evergreens would make
excellent Christmas trees. At this
time the 'abandoned farm* era had be
gun and it looked as if the whole
State would grow up to firs. The bal
sam fir used to be a synonym for
worthlessness. Nowadays 'Canada
balsam' is made Â»from this tree and
thousands of vacation tourists gather
its young twigs for balsam, pillows.
But the wood has always been useles3
to the lumberman. Therefore, when
the New York yachtsman offered to
buy a few shiploads of young firs, the
honest Maine farmers failed to see
the Joke. But when the city man
opened his purse they fell to with a
will.

AS The Call predicted the minority in Congress will
for a while* 5 obstruct* criticize and in some in
stances'vilify the administration in the Panama
matter and will then, fall in and support the new treaty
with, the new. republic.': In this it will follow the course
it took in the 5 matter of Cuban reciprocity.
1 Mr. Williams, the minority leader of the House, took
advantage ot the debate on the pension bill to obstruct
the business of the House by attacking the' President,
accusing him of disobeying the' Spooner law. : That law
required only that he waif 'VreasohaDle time" for (Co
lombia to enter into a canal treaty and then reopen ,ne
gotiations with Nicaragua and 'Costa Rica. Well; the
treaty went before the Colombian Congress last August
and was rejected. Immediately -. upon evidence; that
neither it nor any reasonable treaty to the same purpose
could be made with Colombia a new sovereignty arose
over the isthmus, a new jurisdiction. As soon as this
jurisdiction assumed all the features of a de facto Gov
ernment and as such was recognized by us and almost
simultaneously by Italy, France, Great Britain and Ger
many, we made with if a 1 treaty for the canal more fav
orable than any one had ever dreamed to be possible.
Mr. Williams said that "this was the first time that
this Government had interfered in the domestic affairs
of any South American country." Does he. nof know
that from the moment it was decided by this Government
that it and not private parties would build the canal such
interference became a necessity of the situation? Does
he not know also that his party ceaselessly insisted that
the canal must be a public and not a private enterprise,
and that as such it could not be constructed without pro
jecting our sovereignty within another sovereignty, than
which there is no more acute form of interference in the
affairs of an independent state?
Of course the right to do this would be sought by
treaty. We so sought it in the treaty which Colombia
rejected upon the specific ground that it invaded her sov
ereignty. It is easily thinkable that we would encounter
the same difficulty with Nicaragua and Costa Rica. In
deed it was encountered long ago with both of those
states. They demanded that we offset such grant by
entering into an alliance offensive and defensive with
them, binding ourselves to support them in military ad
ventures and do their fightifl<? against the world if they
chose to embroil themselves with any other power. 'A
treaty to do this very thing was negotiated by Secretary
Frelinghuysen in- President Arthur's administration and
was withdrawn by Mr. Cleveland aniong the first acts
of his first administration. Since then there is no evi
dence that Nicaragua and Costa Rica have changed their
position on that question, and it was such understanding
of their implacability that compelled President McKinley
to turn to the Panama route.
Having advocated a policy which' -necessitates inter
ference in other states, what has Mr. .Williams to say of
the situation that would, jjevelop if they all follow the
example of Colombia and;refuse to. permit it by treaty?
That refusal has already occurred. What then? < FoV
lowing the policy laid down by the Democratic leader,
Cass, nothing would be left to us -but forcible, military
invasion of the isthmus, to. override local by
arms and take the rights which we hold in trust for the
commerce of the world. Events have spared us this last
resort. The de facto sovereignty of Panama assents to
abdicate sovereignty over the - canal strip twenty miles
wide as far as such sovereignty relates to the construc
tion, administration and enjoyment of the use of that
waterway. The administration, instead of being exe
crated for taking advantage of events so favorable,. would
be justly execrable if it had not.
After Mr. Williams had exhausted his' ingenuity in
finding fault and in trying to make an issue useful next
year, he exposed the fatuous policy of his party by. say
ing: "The minority cannot be made to make the mistake
which the majority desires if to make. ... The /Democrats
want a canal: They* want the Nicaragua canal, but if
they cannot get the canal where they think it ought to be
they will take it where they can get it. If the President
now refuses to try and negotiate a treaty with Nicaragua
and Costa Rica, then in God's name hurry up your canal."
This is a rather pitiful exposure- to be made by the
leader of a party. We are taking the only steps to hurry
up the canal and are obstructed only. by Mr. Williams
and his party. The Republicans, are not making them
oppose and obstruct. They are not trying to make them
make any mistake, as their capacity in making mistakes
needs no outside help. They now give notice that they
will pull back all they can, hinder as much as they may,
and then at the end fall in and follow the Republicans,
who would have been glad to have them march as one
force and keep step forward to the result so long hoped
One of Lyraan's followers was gifted

A clang of the fire bell aroused the

wagon was rolling. Out into the street
went the perambulating apparatus.
When bluff old District Engineer
Kinald arrived on the scene his eyes
lighted upon that team of painted
blacks.- The roar the. gruff firefighter

times the attempt at rescue would fail,

Th2 little black ants in the cracks had
the white ones need. There were mil

three feet from the ground. The white
ar.ts would aavancc too near the en

charge out of a crack, get the big fel

The 12th of September. 1896, found
Charles H. McClintock and myself en
camped at Matadi on the Congo, hav
ing debarked the night before from the
big ocean steamer which brought us
from England, where we had equipped
our expedition for a five years' stay in
the interior of Africa.
I had been home and completed the
studies I had determined on when leav
ing here three years ago, and I felt
confident that we were equipped with
the kr.owlc-dge and materials neces
sary to culminate our plans sucess
fully. Mr. McClintock was a young
'man who had become very much inter
ested in my plans for future explora
tion, and a year before I was ready to
return had declared his intention of
returning with me if he had to go as a
stowaway among my goods. When I
found that, in rpite of all the discour
agement I could possibly throw in his
Â¦way. he was still determined, T. became
convinced he had the real exploration

very weals and would lie around and
cry like a baby. He made his will,
and as there was no priest confessed to

up in some meanness and wanted to die
with a clear conscience. I told him he

would regret telling of later. But he

I ?Jdvised him to turn over and aie
gracefully, and he chased me out of
the room with his revolver, Jumping
out of bed to get it as spryly as a .well

he was as well as ever. He had not
taken enough quinine, being prejudiced
against it.; j.V' >
Quinine generally runs t'hfc fever up

degrees and then he began to perspire.
I was getting very much frightened, for

on rising until they burn out the life.
Ten degrees is nearly always fatal, and
jurt before death it drops below nor

down ar.d he slept. The next day it
was entirely gone, but he was so weak
he oou'.d not stand on his feet. I fed
him nuir.in-; in doses of fifteen grains
twice a dav, and the evening of the
third day he was out to dinner, and a
day after no one would have imagined
he had been sick.
During the time we were waiting for
an answer from the company on the
Upper Con^o I came into camp one
evening to find McClintock with a
towel around his head and a fever six
degrees above normal. That was
something startling, but I kept telling
him it was nothing. I put him to bed,
covered him - with three blankets,
bathed his head and wrists with cold
water, and put a cold application on
his chest. It seemed as if he would
never perspire, and, though it is better
to wait until the patient is perspiring
before giving quinine, I gave him fif
teen grains.

Our guns were the latest model
small bore, metal jacket balls, the 30-40
and the 25-35 Winchestersâ with am
munition to last years. We had Colt's
44 revolvers and a good all-around ap
paratus for loading cartridges. We
were stocked with a tennis set and a
bicycle, and besides all this I had my
legerdemain outfit as a side tack. I
had studied under a' professor and be
come quite proficient in all current
sleight-of-hand tricks and meant to
see what the natives would think of
them.
I had an elephant-taming equipment
consisting of chains, ropes, pulleys, etc.
All these things were boxed and most
of them in zinc soldered cases, making
many extra loads besides our beads,
wire and cloth, tenting outfit, clothes,
etc.
We had a chemical outfit for pros
pecting for minerals and diamonds and
geographical tools for taking observa
tions and making maps. It was our
plan to photograph everything, and we
had cameras, plates and other supplies
by. the load. For our geographical
names of rivers, countries, peoples, we
had a phonograph and blank cylinders
by hundreds, expecting to t make an
authentic register of the pronunciation
of the African names: besides I wanted
these registers to show'the similarities
I had noticed in the widely different
languages.
We had spent all our money buying
scientific Instruments, guns, ammuni
tion, brass wire. and cloth. When I
left Matadi for rar trip home brass
win* and cloth wore the currency, and
every load for the Upper Congo was
taken from Matadi by carriers, who
were paid in wire and cloth, the rate
being between $3 and $10 for a load of
sixty pounds to be caried lover the
caravan road of 250 miles. Thirty
thousand carriers were employed then,
end hundreds of thousands of loads
were carried annually to and from
Stanley' Pool; but now the new rail
road transported all the loads to
Tumba, nearly half way to the pool,
and the carriers all started from there
instead of from Matadi. Another
change: When I left Matadi in 1S93
money was of little use for transporta
tion, but now it was absolutely nec
essary to pay the railroad In money,
while the carriers would take nothing
but cloth and v.ire. We were in a di
lemma, having no money to pay the
railroad to transport our goods to the
place where our kind of currency was
good. This was what forced us to
make our offer to the trading company,
for I knew that, once in the interior
with our equipment, we would soon be

tesy complained of, but of that he says: "Naturally the
attitude taken by this corporation has led to the organi
zation by the men, 'and so this everlasting strife between
Employer and employe is kept alive."
The Call does not know how far the complaint thus
made is justified, but the statement is a striking illus
tration'of the value of courtesy in all the affairs of life.
Here is a man who for fifty years has been carrying on
negotiations between workingmen -whom he represents
and their , employers and who during all that time has
been met with the true American spirit- of fairness' and
equality, but who now, despite all that experience, per
mits his judgment to be distorted by a single instance of
discourtesy.- One would reasonably suppose that a man
who has met with but one discourteous corporation of
ficial in fifty years would dismiss that case an excep
tional one and go on his way with no feeling of distrust
against employers generally. It is a fact, however, that
one insult or rudeness rankles so deeply in the mind of
a sensitive man that it leads him to overlook for a time
all the courtesies that are familiar and unnoted, r
While the complaint is unreasonable in that respect it
is none the less a clear statement of a certain phase of
human nature that has to be reckoned with, and the
directors of corporations whose officials are inclined to
treat with contempt or with rudeness the American
workingman would better get a new set of officers.

'â¢Underground rooms in St. Pan
eras." I* one of the subjects dealt with
In the report of the public health
committee submitted to the London
County Council. Not the local, but
the county, authority was the first to
call attention to the large number of
underground rooms in this borough
which are illegally occupied. It was
at first believed that there were "over
400 tenements, affording accommoda
tion for more than 1000 persons," in
contravention of the law. When the
matter was brought to the notice of
the St. Pancras borough council that
body caused an inspection to be mad<?
of the underground rooms in the bor
ough, and the borough medical of
ficer reported that there were 640
rooms, in which the conditions were
practically irremediable, and suggest
ed that the rooms should be dealt
with consecutively and at intervals,
"so as to avoid the serious effects of
â¢udd^nly displacing a large popula
tion." The borough council has now
intimated that notices have been
served requiring the owners of forty
nine of these rooms to discontinue,
within three months, to suffer the
rooms to be let or occupied as dwell
ings contrary to the statute, and that
the remaining cases are being dealt
with. â London Telegraph.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.â John R.
Proctor of Kentucky, president ol the
United States Civil Service Commis
sion and an intimate friend of Presi
dent Roosevelt, died of angina pectoris
at the Cosmos Club in this city to-day,
aged 59 years. He spent last evening
in Baltimore, where he attended the
annual meeting of the National Civil
Service Reform Association and made
an address, apparently being In the
best of health. He was with \ome
friends this â¢ morning at the Cosmos
Club, where he had been a prominent
member for-. many years, but became
suddenly 111 about 10 o'clock. Surgeon
General Wyman of the public health
and marine hospital service was at the
club at the time and immediately ad
ministered medical aid. Proctor., was
assisted to a bed and shortly afterward
went to sleep, and improved so much
as to encourage his friends for a speedy
recovery. Civil Service Commissioner
Cooley notified Mrs. Proctor and also
the President, who expressed concern
and kept In touch with the patient's
condition. â¢ . 1
Shortjy after 2 o'clock there was an
other attack, the stricken man gasped
twice and then death followed. The
President and Mrs. Roosevelt called at
the clubhouse and spent considerable
time, at .the bedside. ... . .
Funeral arrangements are deferred
pending the arrival of a. son, Lieuten
ant Andre M. Proctor, now In charge of
a torpedo boat, stationed at the Nor
folk Navy Yard. . Another son^ John R.
Proctor Jr., is a lieutenant of artillery,
U. S. A. Both of the sons served In
the Spanish-Amerlcan.war.
Proctor was for many years State
geologist of Kentucky. He refused,
even at the dictation of members of
thl State Legislature, to remove com
petent assistants for political reasons,
arid was sustained by all of the Gov
ernors under whom he served until
1893. when, it is stated, the then Gov
ernor wished to make appointments for
personal and political reasons. Proc
tor's appointment on the Civil Service
Commission was urÂ£:ed by Mr. Roose
velt; then Civil Commissioner. He and'
Mr. Roosevelt were colleagues on the
commission from 1893 until Mr. Roose
velt's resignation in 1S95. During' Mr.
Proctor's service on the commission the
number of positions subject to the
merit system increased from 43,000 to
120,000.

peptic Is Willing to Give Up
4v* ' the Struggle.
The confirmed dyspeptic has a3 lit- :
tie interest in life as any human be-
ing. He is unfitted for its duties and
is indifferent to Its charms. He-is un- I
able to enjoy the business and social]
relations tha^ constitute the life of the j
average man. All his hoses are ab- i
sorbed by the one . hope to get well
and again be able to enjoy tha good
thlnps at life. Until this is realized
he is sick at heart and feels himself,
to be of little use.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
sufferer's tree of life. They will cure
him and bring him health and happi-
ness just ' as 'sure and certain as he
takes them. They are sure because
they are natural and no other cure
but a natural one is sure. They act
on the food and digest it just as well
as A stomach would.' They contain :
exactly the same chemical properties
as the digestive liuids of the" stomach.
By putting Stuart's. Dyspepsia Tab-
lets in a bottle or jar with any kind
of food. meat, "eggs or* vegetables, with :
sufficient amount of .water, the proc-
ess of digestion is carried out just as
ii is in a healthy human stomach and
in the same time. There is conse-
quently no unnatural .disturbance. oX-

the "use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
They relieve the weak and Worn out
stomach of its work and permit it to
rest up and recuperate and regain its
normal health and strength. ' ' *
A well known Buffalo physician
says: "I prescribe â¢ Stuart's Dyspep-.
Bia Tablets on all occasions as a re-
lief for -weakened and run down stom-
achs. I find they contain all the in-
gredients necessary for the proper di-
gestion of the food and will .do more
to give the stomach the needed rest
than any medicine I could prescribe.
They have never failed to give imme-
diate relief in all my cases and 1 1 do
not he'sitate to recommend them to all
Sufferers from dyspepsia." ,.':'".':

Dr. Tyndall's Last Lecture.
Dr. Alex J. Mclvor-Tyndall expects
to close his present series of psychic
science lectures here to-night. The
subject for to-night's discourse will
be "Our Common Birthright." Dr.
Mclvor-Tyndall has had a marvelous
popularity here in the somewhat dif
ficult task of teaching the principles
of -what he has designated as psychic
science, as distinguished Yrom phys
ical science. The very evident success
vhich he has attained in his efforts
Is doubtless due to the fact that he
1b at all times logical, scientific and
practical in his theories, adhering
strictly to rationalism, even 'while
Healing with the obscure phenomena
of the forces that are as yet invisible.
In addition to a very pleasing address
and a. power of clear deduction, the
distinguished exponent of the un
known possesses a marvelous psychic
development that enables him to dem
onstrate the psychic powers and fac
ulties of which he speaks. This he
does in an entertaining manner that
appeals to the. amusement lover as
Â¦well as to the seeker after knowledge.
The lecture to-night will be followed
by demonstrations of psychic phe
nomena, and the evening will close
the lecture series for the present year.
Two Pacific Heights families announce

planning to spend the Christmas holi
days at Hotel del Monte. That pro
gramme means rest and comfort for all
and a midwinter outing that will fit the
heads of the households for buckling
down to the business of the new year
with a most almighty zest. Walking,
golf.ngr. driving and riding will raise the
spirits and develop startling appetites,
which the hotel feasts will be ready to
satisfy in a gladdening way that would
make old Epicurus himself show his
teeth in happy content. Why don't you
go to Del Monte for Christmas, or, bet
ter yet. go down there next Saturday and
spend the Christmas week there? â¢

Eulogizes Dead Jurist.
Judge Cabaniss adjourned his court
yesterday In respect to the memory
of ex-Judge William Caldwell, who
died Friday ; morning. In eulogy of
the virtues of the deceased Jurist the
court said that his most conspicuous
and commendable quality, was an in
nate spirt of courtesy reflective of ex
cellent rearing. An absolute devotion
to the interests of his clients was an
other trait worthy of emulation by all
practitioners of law. "Judge Caldwell
identified himself absolutely with his
client." said the court, "and did all
that his-learhing and experience pos
sibly could have done to avail the lat

1FEEL highly gratified to see
that the action of Mayor
Schmitz in 'removing the sur
vivors of the old Board of
Health and in suspending Ma
hony has been sustained by the
Supreme Court. Of course, I
took an interest in the case when
I learned of its character and
filed documents bearing on it.
. The decision also means tliat
the Mayor may remove county
officials as provided for in the
charter. I feel positive that
there will not be any wholesale
removals or any that may be
unnecessary. In view of this de
cision and in spite of the judg
ment of the Superior Court, the
members of the Board of Health
who have continued in office
since dismissal must now step
down and out. It certainly
makes the oilice of Mayor more
autocratic than it has hitherto
been considered by many, but
he is elected in accordance with
the terms of the charter and has
just the powers that lie has con
tended all along were his.
No one will be removed from
position by action of the Mayor
unless there is a good and suf
ficient cause therefor. The Su
preme Court decision will prove
of great benefit in the proper
administration of the affairs of
San Francisco. â A. Ruef on the
decision. :

The removals, iin the language of the
Justices. 1 must be "for cause," -but not
necessarily "for^ cause shown." So it
is. left,' entirely. -.to'. the Mayor to deter
mine what shall } constitute "cause."
Every contention of !the contestants is
knocked . flat by ' the Justices in their
review, of the case.
The opinion is by Justice Lu
clen* Shaw, .with whom â¢ Justices . An^
geUottr'and. Van; Dyke directly, coneurC
No one dissents, whlchTis evidence *that
He must,, however, send a communi
cation to the-.* municipal .'-legislative
body givlng ; notice/ of the removal and
stating his reasons - therefor. The City
Council of San Diego .or the Board of.
Supervisors of "San -Francisco may not
interfere, even if ', the removal is re
garded as ; unjust, jg , The official | ] who
may be affected has no redress at law,
according to the decision. \ ;-
The Mayor/must send him a note ac
quainting him. with "the fact that he is
minus his position. ,â¢ He is not entitled
to a Kearing'andimay be left to guess
why he has been j removed. The court
says that ;the 'Mayor's action In' such
cases Is" summary and /without ante
cedent ; proceeding. > . ;
The court refuses td entertain any |
such view: of trie case? In ' speaking,
of the claim that 'a public office is a j
property rigrit, ' the Justices say:
"There is no doubt that It is erroneous.
A public office Is a^mere public agency
created by the people for the purpose
of the administration of the necessary
functions of. organized society, and the .
agency may at any time be terminated
by the power which created it."
The contestants also averred that
the Mayor in removing an official ex
ercised judicial; power .-.with, which he
is not vested. The court admits that
the authority on this point- Is conflict
ing. In some cases it Is admitted that
the Mayor cannot remove an official
without giving' both a notice and a
hearing. Where the Mayor appoints
officials, however, he has the author
ity to remove them for cause, says the
court. Otherwise, it is said, the Judi
ciary would have to superintend the
administration of the executive depart
ment of government. .
It is explained that the appointments
are made by, the Mayor as an official
and not as 'an Individual, thus opening
the way for the removal of municipal
officers appointed -by a predecessor. It
is set forth clearly that the authority
to dismiss' an official for "cause is vest
ed wholly in the office. of Mayor, andÂ«
that; his actions along such lines are
not subject to % re vie w. / . ,
MUST; STATE REASONS. ' ,<
COURT DISAGREES.
be taken from any individual without
due process of law. Various legal opin
ions are quoted In support of this con
tention.
Ruef contends that the court's opin
ion establishes the right of the Mayor
to remove county officers as well as
his own .appointees, and some of the
city's leading'lawyers seem inclined to
agree with him. It would appear from
the argument that the Zlayor has the
right at least' to suspend county- offi
cers in accordance with the charter
provisions." ,'
When, Mayor Schmitz attempted to
put Countv Clerk Mahony on the rack
and to throw the doctors appointed by
Phelan off the Board of Health he was
stopped. by the courts. - The* Supreme
Court's opinion shows that he acted
within his rights in the second case
and gives the inference that he was
lighten 'the -first" ;.-'
It IsÂ«not at all unlikely that Hutton
will be sorry, that he did not act as
was expected of him on the/ Police
Commission,, and that- Casey may go
back to his team with the regret that
he, , like j Caesar, became' "ambitious"
when elevated to a high position. Some
of Fhelan's appointees are also some
what alarmed, although the gratified
Alie Ruef declares that there will be
no "unnecessary" removals.
the law on the, subject is plain. A pe
tition for a rehearing -and for a re
submission of the case to the court in
bank will undoubtedly be filed by the
cc-ntestants. Rehearings are rarely
granted and more rarely is change of
decision affected.
MEMBERS OF THE STATE SUPREME COURT WHO JOINED IN A DE
Â¦ CISION THAT HOLDS IN EFFECT THAT MAYOR SCHMITZ HAS
POWER TO REMOVE MEMBERS OF MUNICIPAL BOARDS.
A . belated /fishing boat just then
hove in sight. J Lupke hailed, 'the fish
erman and asked him to. send assist
ance from the. shore. The fisherman
understood and notified C. A. McNeil],
the boatman, who dispatched a launch
to Lupke> aid and at 9 o'clock the
night watchman was rescued from" the
then waterlogged .barge.

Help reached Lupke forty " minutes

About 7 o'clock Lupke heard water
swishing. in the hold. He rigged a
small pump^ but soon found. its pow
ers of .suction all Inadequate to cope
â¢with the flood that poured through
the rapidly opening seams. The fast
er^ he -pumped the- higher rose the
water and when" the deck began to
look like a lake Lupke realized thu*
seriousness of his predicament.

"I have a scheme for finishing this
job at one stroke," announced an em
ploye. He suggested dynamite and
proved In theory that the explosive
in a second .'woufd do more than the
dredger's teeth could J accomplish in
a week. Previous experiments with
giant powder had been disappointing,
but the enthusiasm of, the man with
the idea prevailed over the better
judgment of the contractors- and a
small charge of the explosive was
loaded, under the employe's direction,
at the base"-of the pinnacle.
The dynamite was exploded on Fri
day, just .before the " men left for the
night. . A great commotion followed
the , explosion, the " force of which
heejed. the barge on her beam ends.
She righted . and, being apparently
none the worse\ for the.^jar, the day
â¢ workers' went ashore.
The dredging barge moored at
Blossom Rock foundered on Friday
r.ight as a result of having her seams
Jarred open by a blast of dynamite
and in the sinking of the craft Joseph
Lupke, night watchman for the con
tractors, narrowly escaped death by
drowning.
Wakefield & Co. have the contract
for removing enough off the top of
Blossom Rock to bring its highest
peak thirty feet below the level of low
water. The barge, which has been
moored near the rock during the op
erations, was equipped with a dredg
ing derrick, and diving gear. The
divers, engineers and laborers engag
ed/on the work were taken ashore
each afternoon and the barge left in
charge of .Watchman Lupke.
The contract was almost completed.
Soundings showed a depth of thirty
feet in all but one place and that
where stood a pinnacle of hard, ob
stinate' rock. Dredging had been
slow work, but certain, and the orig
inal intention was to have dredged
away that remaining pinnacle.
'employe has scheme.
Mayor Frank P. Frary of San Diego
sent a letter of dls'misal to Fire Com
missionerE. J. Carter. The last named
official thought the city's chief execu
tive lacked the authority to take such
action, and appealed to the courts
through a petition for a writ of certio
rari. The lower court denied his peti
tion, and an appeal was taken to the
Supreme Court. * :.' '
The language of the charters- of the
municipalities of San Diego* and San
Francisco happens to be practically
identical in respect to the Mayor's pow
er to remove appointees for cause. It
is stated in the , charters that the
Mayors shall appoint all officers whose
election or appointment". is; not other
wise specifically provided, for in the
charters or by-law; that they shall
have power, to remove,, for cause, any
persons holding office by their respec
tive, nominations or appointments, and
that In case of such removals written
notices thereof shall, be filed with. the
respective municipal legislative bodies.
In view of this similarity in the:pro
visions of the two charters the lawyers
all agree that this > decision- in . the San
Diego case applies directly /.; to ' San
Francisco, and. the Justices of . the /Su
preme Court were formally apprised of
such contentions through the brief filed
by Abe Ruef. The ; attorneys [. for: Car
ter and amlca curlae asserted that pub
lic office i is a ' property, which" may 'not
REMOVES OFFICIAL.
The court has thus greatly increased
the autocracy of the government of
San Francisco. Attorney Ruef assev
erated last night that county officers
were also affected by the decision. The
opinion does not make any such state
ment, though it leaves the question
open to "argument or further litigation.
The case on which the Supreme Court
decision is based had its origin in the
city of San Diego.* When the points In
volved became known to local politi
cians Ruef intervened with a brief. The
whole thing has been done very quietly
and few outsiders had any Idea that the
local dispute wouia be settled until a
decision had been rendered in the
Board of Health case. The opinion is
sweeping in its terms and not a Justice

at her rooms at 873 Market street on
May 3. When she came up for trial
before Judge Cook a question was
raised as to her sanity. Bhe was tried
and convicted of the charge of assault
to murder, but when examined by the
Insanity Commissioners they declared
that she was irresponsible and she was
sent to the insane asylum at Napa on
October 10 and sentence suspended.
Last Tuesday Dr. Elmer E. Stone,
medical superintendent at the asylum,
sent a certificate to Judge Cook that.
in his opinion, the woman was not In
sane, although a degenerate of the
criminal type, and should be punished
for her crime.
When she appeared for sentence
and was asked if she had anything to
say' she mads a rambling statement
that she defended herself because she
was being choked. The Judge said it
was not the first assault of the kind she
had made. He thought when she was
brought before him that she was not
of- sound mind and the Commissioners
fouTid ' her so and sent her to an
asylum, but the . authorities of the
asylum had sent her back. He said
he thought they had better be there
a little longer and know their busi
ness better before they undertook to
set up their opinions against seyeral

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
114S Center street, Dec. 12.
Professor Jacques Loeb of the physi
ological department of the University
of California has Just completed a
series of experiments to ascertain the
relative toxicity to marine animals of
distilled Â¦water, sugar solutions and
eolutions of the various constituents
of sea water that have produced re
markable results.
The experiments have led the distin
guished physiologist to no less a con
clusion than that sea water is a physi
ologically balanced salt solution for the
animals contained in it, and that the
serum of an animal is a similar solu
tion in relation to the tissues of an
animal.
"It is a solution," cays Dr. Loeb, "in
which there Is a mutual prevention of
the poisonous actions which the indi
vidual constituents have if they are
alone in solution. If the changes of
the concentration of the individual
constituents of such a physiologically
balanced solution take place within
certain narrow limits one can call
forth in the tissues properties which
they do not normally possess, such as
the artificial parthenogenesis, rythmi
cal twltchings and the increase in the
irritability of the muscles and nerves.
I am of opinion that this point of view
Â¦will prove fruitful in pathology, espe
cially in the study of nervous dis
eases."
The experiments were carried on
With marine animals, they being sub
jected to distilled water and other so
lutions to determine how long the res
piratory movements persisted. They
were suggested by the discoveries of
other investigators, who made experi
ments on the cause of the poisonous
action of distilled water on marine an
imalB, which led to the unexpected re
rult that certain animals die as quick
ly in sugar solutions Isosmotic with sea
water as in distilled water.
Dr. Loeb found that If the species
Cammrus be transferred suddenly
from 6ca water into distilled water the
breathing of the animal always ceases
in about half an hour, and sometimes
much sooner. If the animals are re
placed directly after the cessation of
breathing back into the sea water they
recover. If about ten minutes or longer
elapse no recovery takes place. The
Eojourn in the distilled water causes
chances In the abdominal ganglia of
the animals, which become in a short
time irreversible, and from this the
death cf the animal results.
At first Dr. Loeb was of i.he opinion
that the entrance of the distilled water
into the tissues was responsible for
the fatal action; but he finds this idea
restricted by the discovery that if the
animals be transferred to a pure sugar
Bolution of about the same osmotic
k pressure as that of sea water in which
they live the respiratory movements
cease In about as short a time as in
distilled water. In other words, a su
gar solution almost isomotic with sea
water is Just as poisonous as distilled
water.
SCIENTISTS CONCLUSION.
On this point Dr. Loeb Btates his
conclusions to be as follows:
We must draw the following conclusions
from then? experiments: Hither thÂ» distilled
â¢water acts In a tnxlc way by t-merlns into
the titeutf. in which case, however, the tis
fuÂ«Â« of the anlmsl mutt be Just as .permeable
for the Fugar a? the distilled â¢water: or the
toxic action of the distilled water lor Cam
itieiu* in ti'-pendert especially on the fact that
â¢ ertain raits or iofis diffuse from the animals
ir.to the <Jift!lled water. With this assump
tion it would be clear, without further <3ig
ruwion. why an isosmoUe or a dilute sugar
solution if Ju?t as jioieonous for the animal
â¢ r <iirtilled water. Whether the permeability
cr the superficial layers of tbÂ» cells is changed
cr net csrniot he decided by direct observation.
Another striking demonstration ex T
periment was Dr. Loeb's discovery that
diftillfd water increases in toxicity if
all the salts contained in sea water,
with the pxcrption of sodium chloride,
be added to it In the concentration In
which th^y are contained In sea water.
For the more practical uses of In
vestigation Dr. Loeb proposes that the
marine animals be divided into three
groups according to their behavior to
ward distilled water, the division to be
*Â£* follows:
rThe ftrÂ« rroup consists cf forms for which
distilled water Is entirely harmless. To this
rroup animals euch as Fondu'.us belonir. The
Â»PBs of this animal do not ewfll if they arÂ«
toroupht suddenly from sea water Into distilled

Members of the Bohemian and Cca
mos clubs who are wont to congregate
within the walls of those two exclusive
establishments during- the late hours
of the afternoons missed from their
midst yesterday one of their associates
In the person of Edward K. Clarke, but
later their anxiety as to his where
abouts was relieved by a startling
piece of news which furnished food for
pleasant gossip until long after night
had cast its shroud upon the city.
Clarke forsook his club haunts on
Friday afternoon and crossed the bay
to Oakland, where at a few minutes
after midnight yesterday he was mar
ried, the bride being Mrs. Rosalind H.
Bower. Not the slightest intimation
was given by Clarke to his many
friends in this city of his matrimonial
intentions.
He quietly secured his wedding ring
the previous day from a downtown Jew
elry firm, sauntered up to the Bohe
mian Club, where he spent an hour or
so, and then disappeared. Friday, by
appointment, Mrs. Bow*erand ClarkÂ©
met in Oakland. Before they had real
ized the fact, however, the hour for,
closing the County Clerk's office had
come and gone and "as evening ad
vanced the couple began to appreciate
their annoying perplexity, for without
a license their marriage could not be
performed. In the : midst of .their di
lemma the prospective groom suddenly
thought of his friend, Hay Baker, the
Deputy County Clerk of Alameda
County, who was located shortly be
fore midnight 'and gladly went to the
assistance of the despairing pair. The
trio immediately proceeded | to the
County Clerk's office, where the license
was quickly issued, and from there the
Journey was made to the home of the
Rev. Mr. Van de Mark at 319 Eleventh
street, and the minister was aroused
from his slumbers and told the mean
ing of the midnight visit. After a
short wait he appeared and the cere
mony was duly performed.
Clarke is the son of Mrs. Jeremiah
Clarke, one of San Jose's well
known society women, who is now
traveling in Europe. Her husband has
been dead for many years, but he left
a-large estate, and the son's share was
in the neighborhood of $300,000. He has
only recently returned from a tour
through Europe himself, j He- was mar
ried in much the same way several
years ago, but his wife died about { a
year ago, and this is his second ven
ture.
Mr. acd Mrs. Clarke have gone to
his Los Guillcos Valley ranch in So
noma County to spend their honey
moon, at the conclusion of which they
will return to this city to reside for
the winter, preparatory to a trip -East.

The fleetest greyhounds In all Amer
ica met in the ninth renewal of the
John Grace Challenge Cup stake yes
terday at Union Coursing Park in
"trials of the most sensational order.
The field of green was like velvet. The
leaden skies constantly threatened
rain, but none fell to mar the run
ning 1 .
The greyhounds were so equally
matched that in nearly every trial they
ran neck and neck across the field.
The hares were unusually strong and
afforded trails which, without excep
tion, allowed the better dog to win.
There was not an undecided trial dur
ing the day, this being a record in
itself. '^c'. ;: S: : '
The closest students of form will not
hazard a guess as ta-Jhe ultimate stake
winner. The coursers are so evenly
matehed they find it difficult to pick
the winner in individual trials without
going beyond that point. At a rough
guess Full Moon is named as having
?hown the most speed in the upper half
of the card, while Rubber Ankles, the
Waterloo winner, looks good in the
lower half. Pocatelli has apparently
lost the flight of speed he displayed
some months since.
The Eastern greyhounds held their
own well. Cloudburst, Celtic, Texas
Hoo-Hoo, Northern Express, J E H
and Frisco Lad are still in the run
ning, for the cup.
There were several upsets in the bet
ting. Texas Hoo-Hoo beat the 1 to 5
choice Rocker Arm; X oun S Johnny
Rex beat Barge at the same odds;
Northern Express beat Mi Amlgo at
Â£'to 3; Colored Lady beat Rapid Water
at 4 to 1; The Referee beat Mount Rose
at 3>Â£ to 1; Vandal beat Tralee Boy at
2 to 1;- Real Article beat Fair Tralee
and Lily Wright beat Menlo Prince at
5 to 3; Sacramento Boy, twice winner
of the cup, was retired by the young
dog Charter 'Member.
The first round of the Purse was
run yesterday for dogs beaten in^the
cup. The concluding round of the cup
with the Purse and the Plate will be
run to-day. This will bring into the
running all the dogs originally entered.
Judge John Orace, in honor of whom
the cup was .named, officiated in the*
saddle for the first time since he was
Injured, four "months ago. The results

Ah Fue, a Chinese merchant of this
city, left on the steamer China for China
yesterday to escape being killed by
highbinders. Fue was a contractor,
furnishing Chinese help for the Alaska
canneries. . The men he employed
claimed that he had not given them all
the money that was coming to them
and marked him for an ignominious
death. Ever since his return from
Alaska, a few months ago, Fue has
given Chinatown a wide berth, as he
knew he was a marked man.; Tester
day, just as the China was about to
pull out from her dock, the almond
eyed gentleman rushed aboard clad in
American clothes and wearing specta
cles and other means of disguise.' ,Â¦. As
the ship drew away from the wharf
Fue could be seen calmly smiling to
himself at having outwitted his would

"When I was In Seattle I saw streets

all that- could be wished. It might
be a good idea to try it here. Yester

where a corporation is making bricks

from the company to lay a block as
an experiment.
"The subject of , oiling streets and

MAYOR OLXEY GREATLY
rLEASED WITH 3IEETIXG
The sum of $25,000 will be* expended
on parks In West, North and South
Berkeley, sections of town that are en
tirely lacking In recreation spots. A
large amount of apparatus will be pur
chased with $30,000 to start a fire de
partment for the better protection of
the people's property, $20,000 will be
spent on street Improvements and $15,
000 on manual training In the schools,
an Improvement that is receiving the
support of a citizens' committee, tha
Town and Gown Club and the various
Improvement clubs of. the town.
"It Is likely that the citizens' com
mittee I have Just appointed," said Mr.
Rickard to-day, "will change the items
1 mentioned in mylette'r to the Trus
tees. Some of '. the amounts may be
raised and some reduced. It is possible
that an item calling for the building of
a wharf at' West Berkeley will be in
serted " in the bonding proposition. A
good deal depends on what "the different
improvements will cost. At any rate, a
full Investigation by go large a commit
tee will be sure. to show exactly what
the town needs and to impress- the peo
ple with the Importance of voting for
those needs."
It Is proposed that when . the} bond
election is settled upon the ballots be
so arranged as to permit voters to 'vote
upon each item separately. This; Is a
matter," however, that will.be settled by
the 'citizens' committee -and the'Trus
tees. Â¦ . â¢ '*"'Â¦Â¦Â¦
MAY CHANGE THE ITEM.
This committee will meet at the call
of President Rickard within a week or
so and organize for the work before it.
A chairman will be chosen, and he will
appoint sub-committees to investigate
and report â¢ upon the 'several items it
has been suggested to put in the pro
posed bond issue. When the work of
the sub-committees has been approved
by the large committee the whole bond-
Ing scheme will be submitted to the
people at an election and a determined
effort made to secure the requisite two
thirds of the votes.
If the suggestions of President Rick
ard are carried out the people will be
asked to vote at least $265,000 in bonds.
With this sum it is hoped to make Im
provements in every municipal depart
ment, improvements which cannot now
be considered on account of the low ebb
of the city's finances.
Of this $265,000 it Is proposed to spend
5100,000 on a new City Hall. The pres
ent town building is not considered a
credit to a town that now ranks sev
enth in point of population in Califor
nia, and a more dignified structure is
demanded.
On the schools It i\ proposed to spend
$75,000 of this sum. As is\well known,
the schools of Berkeley are always
crowded. More buildings are needed,
and more lots upon which to build
them. This $75,000 will be augmented
by the money that Is to be received
from the sale of the present school site
on Center street.
.5265,000 IS SUM NEEDED.

BERKELEY, Dec. 12.â Thomas Rick
ard. president of the Board of City
Trustees, announced to-day the names
of those he has selected as members of
the citizens' bond committee, .the duty
of which will be to collect data upon
the several bonding propositions treat
ed of In President Rickards' recent.let
tervto the Board of Trustees, and sub
mit It to the people for their decision.
The committee is composed of some
forty prominent citizens, chosen from
each of the city's wards according to
the voting strength of each ward, the
following named being members:
Russell and Robinson of this city re
ceived a note from Los Angeles signed
by Johnson for a considerable sum of
money. He had found some one to ex
change coin for his signature, and it
has been the aim of the lender to trade
u back again ever since. The lawyers
sent their office boy around to John
son's training quarters in West Oak
land with the note, and he was told to
po back to the office and tell his em
ployers that if they bothered him any
more that he would go up there and
clean out the shop. That night -they
Kot out the writ. Only after they had
given the writ to the San Francisco
Sheriff did they discover that Colma
was in San Mateo County, and It was
Because a firm of lawyers attempted
to collect a note from Jack Johnson,
the colored pugilist, he wants to clean
out their office. They say that because
he secured an indifferent decision over
Sandy Ferguson at Colma the other
night that he believes he can fight the
law, and they have written him a letter
offering to take him on at catch
weights.
It was not the only luck Johnson had
v.hen he was given a decision Friday
night. Lying in the Sheriff's office in
San Francisco Is a writ of attachment
issued here by Justice of the Peace
Quinn against Johnson's share of the

"Jack the Hugger" is around again
and so are his arms. "Jack" has been
doing some promiscuous hugging in
the neighborhood of Berkeley station
lately and several defenseless women,
going home in the dark, have been at
tacked by him, though they are shy
about giving their names to the public.
The police, however, are looking for
the man in the hope that they may
get him in jail and keep*him there un
til his strange humor wears away.
Miss Marie Carcot of 2032 Addlson
street was attacked by this human
bear while she was going home last
night about 10 o'clock. It is dark .in
the shadows o' her home and before
she knew it the "Hugger" had his arms
around her. She resented his Importu
nities, however, by a good hard slap
on the face thai, sent him reeling In the
other direction. Then she took to her
heels and ran to her door, screaming at
the top of her voice. "Jack" recovered ,
quickly from the blow she gave him
and hurried after her, but she managed
to get inside her door and slam !t in
his face.
Miss Carcot was too ill from fright^
to leave her home to-day, but through
her relatives she gave the police a
good description of the man who ac
costed her.- She describes him as big
and black and burly and poorly
dressed.
This is the second visit "Jack the
Hugger!' has paid to Berkeley within ,
the last two years. When he was here
the last time he made himself so ob
noxious that a posse of citizens dressed
up in women's clothes and patrolled
the streets. He was caught while try
ing to hus one of these citizens one
night and subsequently sent out of
town.
It is possible that the scheme will be
again put to use.

Club J. F.. Lawless, jgeneral manager of
the San Francisco Gas & Electric Com
pany, has agreed' to install twenty
lights in Oceanside. The water com
pany, has pipes laid to H street and
Forty-seventh avenue and is ready to
proceed farther as soon -as the grading
of- Sol Getz & Son's blocks and streets
adjoining are completed. At- their
meeting last Friday night, the mem
bers of the club pledged themselves to
do, their utmost the coming season to.
secure from, the city the necessary ap ;i
propriatipn to grade, ii street to the
ocean! It was reported to the club that
the Park Commissioners had set aside
$6000 to be .expended .for the Improve
ment of the Ocean boulevard. A com
mittee of, fjf teon members of the" club
was_ appointed to wait.. on' Mayor
Schmitz to ask his aid and co-opera
tion in the work for the interest of
the Oceanside district. K
Â¦" Mayor. Schmitz gave a hearing yes
terday to a committee, appointed by the'
Oceanside Improvement Club. The
opening of K street was the subject
of this Interview. It was,explained that
without a . graded, street' leading direct
from' the city , the , residents of the'
Oceanside district were deprived of the
most important privilege of getting liv-"
ing "supplies or .material for improve
ments as" cheaply as residents of other
city "districts. The Mayor was appealed
to urge upon ' the Park Commission'-'
ers the necessity of widening the. Ocean'
boulevard and placing electric arc
lights thereon, \ as ; such Improvements
would j be aDpreciated the general
public .as averting the colliding c-f ve
hicles. The" necessity for an engine
house with, fire* apparatus was dwelt
upon, .the .committee stating that even
a chemicar engine, for the present need:
would , be acceptable. The . establish
ment, of TiGxv. grades was also thorough
ly, discussed, i A mounted police patrol:
belngf very much needed, the \ Mayor,
was asked, to, use hisi. g6od. ofnees to
obtain the same. for. the : district. . The
.Mayor, by his ; expressions showed that"
he was in 'accord I with the" statement*
of .'the Improvement- .Club's committee"
and \ assured \ them that he would â¢ give

street one evening last week while a
clothing s.tore was being boycotted and
ordered- to appear in court yesterday,
failed to â¢ appear when the case was
called, but N Walter Temple, attorney,
appeared in his stead and asked for. an
Immediate decision.. The court declined,
however, and gave' himself another
week to digest the conflicting testi
mony. . .
Miss Nellie Orth, 15 years of age and
residing with her parents at 413% Octa
via street, appeared before: Judge Mo
gan as complainant against Mrs. Peck,
dwelling on Fulton street, between
Gough and Octavia, and the burden of
Mies Orth's complaint was that Mrs.
Peck' had displayed a revolver and
threa'toned to shoot her simply because
she went into that woman's yard to set
aright a portionof her apparel that had
become disarranged whfle she was at
play. A warrant was issued for the ar
rest of Mrs. Peck. and the case will.be
heard to-morrow.
; Oii the eventful night, while the lights
in the \ Pacific street* home of Terp
sichore shone o'er ; a scene of; revelry
seldom or never excelled in the annals
of San . Francisco's cdlored social func
tionsi George Stewart was "friskin*
roun' " and otherwise annoying Miss
Walker, .when "Cooney'^ entered Â» and
demanded reason for the ungallant per
secution. Instead of explaining any
thing orally, said Mr. Miller, Mr. Stew-^
art, who, was" seated; in a chair \ti\ted
backward, made a movement^as ' if he
Were* about' to] draw, a"; pistol' from'; his
hip"; pocket," .whereupon Mr. Slaughter
preceded him \ nrid , fired , two shots.

stated his vocation ; as "profeshnul
prlzeflghtah; Bah," testified that he, too,
witnessed * Mr. Slaughter "tie up" with
During the earlier proceedings in
Judge Mogan's court the auditorium of
that temple of justice was remotely
suggestive of the "first part" setting
of a genuine negro minstrel show.' No
less than three Afro-American names
were on the trial docket, with a sep
arate offense registered against each,
and the assemblage outside the rail
was very largely made up of persons
of Ethiopian ancestry and varied social
standing. But as two of the cases
came from the Barbary Coast the ma
jority of dusky spectators were of the
select set of that quarter, the remain
der being sympathizing acquaintances
of Robert Mitchell", who broke, the arm
of a white. co-laborer named G.' W. De
ment by viciously striking that mem
ber with a shovel. That case will be
heard !atcr. . ...
Then came a Pacific street- saloon
keeper, who was accused of . having
disturbed the peace by addressing loud
and vulgar, language to a feminine
habitue of his establishment, and after
he had been dismissed with a severe
reprimand the case of Â¦ the People vs.
Claude Slaughter, charged with shoot
ing at George Stewart, mlssing'him and
hitting a'juvenile bystander's leg, was
taken up and testimony for the defense
heard.'^;;/;/;^:'^'
There was a perfect: thundercloud of
witnesses ready to testify that Mr.
Slaughter had been provoked to make
a target of Mr. Stewart, who. by the
way, is noted as "the champion cake
walker of the Pacific Slope," having
earned the title in actual contest at
one of the local theaters. First came
Mr. Miller, who always alluded to the
defendant as "Cconey" ' Slaughter. Mr.'
Miller was positive that Mr. Stewart
and his brother were at enmity' with
"Cooney" for some time previous to the
shooting, and that in order to pique
the latter they, missed no 'opportunity
to "pester" Miss Irene Walker, know
ing that the young woman , was much
beloved by "Cooney."
When the case was called yesterday
aridthe doctor's affidavit had been read
the prosecuting attorney broadly hint
ed that Miss Clark's illness was of al
coholic origin and sustenance, and the
Judge seemed "to entertain a similar
opinion, for he informed the woman's
attorney that if she fails to appear in
person before him at high noon to
morrow he wijl enforce her attendance
through the medium or a "posse comi-
stance sent fa physician's certificate to
the effect that she- was physically in
disposed and absolutely unfitted to
brave with safety the ordeal of a Po
lice Court trial.
Passengers on the Xorth Shore Line
Suffer a Jarring by an Accident -
Near Hamlet Station.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 12. â The
southbound North Shore train was de
railed south of Hamlet Station to
day. ' A serious wreck was narrowly
avoided. The passenger train was en
route from Cazadero to San Franci3co
and when rounding a curve on the
bay shore struck a large boulder and
was derailed. The engineer succeeded
in stopping the train before the cars
left the track or his engine ran into
the bay. The locomotive did not turn
over and no one was injured.
Traffic was delayed only a short
time by the wreck. The cause^f the
Daughters of St. George
Britannia ' Lodge of " the Order of
Daughters of St. George had an enter
tainment and holiday season bazaar in
its hall in the Pythian Castle Decem
ber 1. The Â¦ membership turned out in
full force and the many friend* of the
ladies were on hand to be entertained
and to help swell the number of those
who were patrons of the prettily ar
ranged booths. The programme of mu
sic, songs and specialties, including lit
erary efforts, was interesting and en
tertaining. The young ladies during the
evening served English tea and cakes
to their fellow members and visitors.
TRAIN* STRIKES A ROCK
BUT ESCAPES A DISASTER
bowlder being on the track was . that
men had been blasting in the right of
way and the rock fell on the rails.
Mr. Stewart, also the resultant shoot
ing.. "Ah smelt Irubble a-comln', an*.
phoah enuff. It came," said "Muldoon."
After the first shot was fired Mr. Mc-
Donald, with true gladiatorial reckless
ness, "mixed in" and grasped the pistol
hand of Mr. Slaughter In time to divert
bullet No. 2 from its intended target
and to pierce the floor instead. *
Miss Irene Walker, after blushingly
acknowledging affection for the defend
ant, toid of how the Stewart brothers
were in the habit of "peckin' on" her
every time they saw her, and of how
on one occasion they had visited the
apartment occupied by her and "busted
In de doah mos' shamefully" and sub
jected her to other indignities, all of
which she related.
Then the defendant, of coal-black
visage, took ; the stand and recounted
various acts of provocation on the part
of the champion cakewalker. "He art'
his bruddah," said Mr. Slaughter, "were
soah at me ovah some ole trubble, an'
dey allus was a-pesterin* an' peckin' on
mah gal. A gemman fr'en' ,tole me dat
de Stewartsi said dey would git me if
Ah went to de colored ball las' Thanks
gibin' night in a Turk street hall, an'
to avoid trubble Ah didn't go. Dey
were allus a-provokin' ' an' tryin' to
start suthin'."
Mr. Slaughter did not deny the shoot
ing, nor did he attempt to show that he
did not shoot to kill. He simply plead
ed provocation . sufficient to warrant
the deed.
The court reserved its decision till to
morrow. .Â¦Â¦-â¢
Judge Mogan issued a "come-or-l'll
send-for-you" warning to Miss Amber
Clark, accused of grievously assault
ing Miss Louise Harcourt in the lat
ter's apartment in an O'Farrell-street
boarding-ho-u^e of which the defendant
is landlady. Miss Clark was arrested
and released- on bail, and since then
she has twice failed to appear when
the case was called, but in each ln-
Twenty-four hours of sober thought
as to the wisdom of defying the law
and its established dispensaries evi
dently had a reformatory effect upon
the erstwhile haughty demeanor of
Timothy Nyhan. saloonman and minor
politician, for when he faced the tri
bunal of Judge Fritz yesterday morning
his attitude showed marked change
from that exhibited by him while occu
pying the same spot the previous day.
Mr. Nyhan had been arrested for re
fusing to provide for his .five minor
children after their maternal guardian
had been sentenced to sixty days' im
prisonment for selling liquor without
a license at 427 Clementina street.
When first arraigned he displayed con
tempt of the court and the arresting
officer, and audibly and profanely
opined that lie had been treated un
justly. Then he was 'remanded until
yesterday, and reflection. during the in
terim apparently convinced him that
Mabel Edwards, a pretty girl who
swore she was 21 years of age but did
not look to be more than 18, was be
fore Judge Fritz for general wayward
ness and the case developed a repeti
tion of the oft-told tale of parental neg
lect and its shocking consequences to
the object thereof. The girl's father
is somewhere in the East ' ' and her
mother's whereabouts she did not know,
so there was no restraining hand put
forth when she began to wander from
the straight path. The case was con
tinued till next Wednesday, by which
time, the court hoped, the young wom
an will have obtained employment that
may enable her to lead a better life." â¢
The complaining officer testified that
while he was passing- the residence of
Milkman Shones, in the Richmond dis
trict, he saw that person administer
ing unnecessary punishment to a de
crepit horse by beating the animal on
the head with a heavy whip handle.
He commanded that the cruelty cease,
and then examined tha equine and
found a festering sore on its back.
When he proceeded to arrest the milk
man the latter cursed him roundly and
became eo obstreperous that the "po
liceman was compelled to knock him
down ar.d handcuff him.
A woman who occupied an adjoining
house stated that from an open ,win
dow she witnessed the beginning of
the altercation between the policeman
and the milkman, but was forced j to
shut the window when the milkman's
language became unfit for publication.
Then a masculine witness testified with
the a!r of a good Samaritan who de
plored cruelty to dumb creatures and
also loved his neighbor as himself, and
his testimony did not cut much figure
either for or against the prosecution.
The court reserved its decision.
August H. Shones, a milkman, was
before Judge Megan on charges of
cruelty to animals, battery and dis
turbing the psace, all sworn to by Po
liceman Bean.
The' court met Mr. Nyhan's forgiv
ing mood half-way and dismissed thÂ»
charge against him.
he could v.in nothing by flying in the
face of the court. So in penitent mood
he expressed to take care
of his offspring: and to close and keep
closed the Clementina street groggery,
and then, as evidence of his sincerity,
he paid the fine of JCO imposed upon
his better half and thus secured her
release from durance.
In the dark, "pen" , of Judge Fritz'a
court the nose of J. B. Barco, booked
as "wine bum." loomed radiant as the
Point Reyes light when environed by
a fog, and when Mr. Barco stepped
forth to face the bench the luminosity
of his nasal organ dimmed by contrast
the refulgence shed by a big yellow
diamond in the shirt front of a sporting
gentleman in the front row of specta
tors. His Honor blinked and then
shaded his eyes with his hand as he
surveyed Mr. Barco's headlight.
'"That facial embellishment' of yours
must have cost a pretty' penny?" ven
tured the Judge.
'"Oh, not so much," airily answered
the defendant. . .Â« ; ;
"A computation of the number of
drinks required to produce an effect
like that would be interesting," the
court continued.
"It's a queer thing," said Mr. Barco,
In injured tone, "that the bulbous for
mation and vormilllon tint of my nose
should be constantly getting me wrong
fully accused of immoderate drinking."
"Still." went on the pitiless critic, "I
would lay odds that yours has not been
a Hfe of total abstinence from exhila
rating fluids. Your nose is only a por
tion of the visible evidence that war
rants this belief. Your general make
up is strongly indicative of a careless
ness as to personal appearance that is
reprehensible, to say the least. Do you
remember when you last had a bath?"
Mr. Barco immediately plunged into
mental calculation, but ere he could
give answer to the query he was con
signed to sixty day& imprisonment. -,
"They will bathe you up there," said
the court, "and I would suggest that
when your term of incarceration ex
pires you devote more attention to ex
ternal application of water and less en
ergy to absorption of spirituous liquors.
So long, and may your nose soon Io3e
its luster."
Its Refulgence Illumes the Shadowy "Pen,"
Fades by Contrast the Glint- of a Big
Diamond and Dazzles the Judicial Eyes

In the inquest upon the body of
Michael Walsh, who was killed at Fif
teenth and Harrison streets on Decem
ber 6 by a railroad train, a verdict was
returned that the manner of the acci
dent was unknown to the Jury.
Within the last year the bodies of
three men have been found at the foot
of the cliff at the~ Intersection of Mont
gomery and Lombard streets. This cliff
was formed by quarrymen. Its crest
on Telegraph Hill is not lighted at
night and is altogether unprotected by
a fence or any other obstruction. The
unfortunate victims of municipal apa
thy were supposed to have walked off
the cliff while wandering around the
steep sides of the hill while intoxicated,
and there have been whisperings of
foul play and robbers', but the police
have never been able to secure any evi
dence to show that death was the re
sult of a crime.
The latest victim was Clarence Frank,
a young soldier from the Angel Island
barracks. He was found unconscious
on December 7 and died in the Central
Emergency Hospital a short time after
ward. At the inquest held yesterday
the jury returned a verdict that death
was accidental, caused by falling over
the cliff, and the Jury recommended
that the city erect a fence to prevent
further accidents.

EXA3IPLE OF THIRD GROUP
mmmm
From hia Investigations Dr. Loeb
draws the following conclusions
iiplil
OÂ» If sea water Is diluted by the addition
This would be an error, since. In the first
place, oxygen and carbonic acid pass. In a
ttate of solution, through the membranes of
the animals or of their eggs, and since, more
over, salts and Ions para through tire mem
branes of thÂ« animals In both directions. A
relatively small Increase of the concentration
of potassium t.alts of the sea water, for ex
exple. causes the heart In embryos to ceasÂ« to
heat, and if thÂ« egg be brought soon enough
Into a medium with less potassium the hem
aifam begins to beat. It misht be thought
from this that the animal Is permeable for
ions but not for water. â¢ Then, however, the
Question remains unanswered as to why the
animal does not become impoverished In ealts
In distilled water and Â«o die.
I believe that we must acknowledge that be
sides differences of osmotic Â¦ pressure there
must be taken Into account other conditions
for the exchange of fluids In animals Ilka
F^ndulus. The secretion of the kidneys apd
the absorption of fluid in the Intestines show
that for the explanation of the movements of
fluids In the living organs differences of os
motlo pressure alone are not sufficient. For
animals like Fundulus a solution of Mg Iso
motie in the sea water Is much more deleteri
ous than dletilled water.
The second croup Includes those animals
or tissues which behave as If they were sur
rounded by a semi-permeable wall which Is
easily permeable for water, but impermeable or
less permeable for all or many salts. The red
blood- corpuscles represent this type.
AS TO THE SEA URCHIN.
water and they do not shrink with the reverse
change of conditions. One might be lncllr.ed
to assume that these animals are surrounded
by an absolutely Impermeable membrane. -
HEART ACTIOX CEASES.
If. however, a solution of the sami salts be
used in which not only the sodium chloride,
but also the K and Ca salts are diluted ten
fold the animals may live five houtj. These
facts support the theory already advanced by
me at an earlier date that the sea water ;s a
physiologically balanced salt solution for the
animals contained In It and that the serum of
an animal Is a similar solution in relation to
the tissues of the animal. It Is a solution In
which there Is a mutual prevention of the poi
sonous actions, which the Individual constitu
ents have if thry are alone In solution.
If the chunks of the concentration of the
Individual constituents of such a physiolog
ically balanced solution take place within cer
tain narrow limit* on- can call forth In the
tissues properties which they do not normally
possess, such as the artificial parthenogenÂ»*tn,
rhythmical twitching* and the Increase in the
Irritability of the museU* and nerve*. I am
of the opinion that this point of view will
prove fruitful in pathology (especially In the
study of nervous diseaxes).
(h) The experiments trlve ground for the
idea that the toxic action of distilled watÂ»t
and thÂ» sugar solution on Oammann depends
Fcsentlally on the fact that electrolytes or
loniÂ» leave the. bedy. Possibly the exit of an
taecnietlc ealtn or Ions takes place with un
equal rapidity or In unequal relations. Such a
disturbance of the relations of the concentra
tion of antajtonlntlc salt* or Ions In the tlimies
of the anlmalc must hasten the onset of death.
SALT SOLUTION* BALANCED.
(e) If a solution be employed which contain*
NaCl, KC1 and CaC12 In the concentration In
which the salts of Na. Ca end K are contained
in sea water. Gammarus lives In such a solu
tion for many days. The addition of MgC12
lengthens the duration of life stllL more; th*
addition of other constituents of the sea water
seems, however, to. have no further power of
prolonging the Mo of the animals. Â¦ ,..
(f) It follows from these tacts that In the
first place the sodium chloride contained ir* tlv*
sea water is poisonous when It alone is pres
ent: and Gammarus dies quickly In such a
solution. The toxlclty of the NaCl 1Â» pre
vented by the Ca and K salts contained in
the sea water. When present alone the K and
Ca ions contained in the sea water are also
and to a still greater extent poisonous. Their
toxic effect Is counteracted by the sodium
ehldr^de contained In the sea water, j
(g^for the mutual counteraction ot these
poisonous effects It Is necessary that the con
centration of the salts or Ions which act an
tagonistically should stand In a definite rela
tion to one another. Thla relation represents
approximately that in which -they are In nor
mal sea water. If one takes a solution In
which the podium chloride is diluted tenfold,
while K and Ca are present In the concentra
tion In which they exist in normal sea water,
the animals die in such a solution In about a
quarter of an hour.
fd) In a solution which contains all other
conetitur nts of the sea water, but no sodium
chloride, the animals die still more quickly
than in. distilled water. - â¢ â¢*' â¢ â¢
(c) In a pure sodium chloride solution, Isos
motlc with sea water or lsss concentrated, the
respiratory movements of Gammarus cease
about .as quickly as in distilled water.
A DEAUL.Y SOLUTION.
or distilled water the duration of lire decreases
at first only xllghtly with an increaM'tn the
degree of dilution. But as eocn an a dilution
of ten times Is reached an abrupt decrease in
the duration of life takes place with further
dilution. Whether the curve of the duration
of life at this place is discontinuous is not yel,
proven. If the sea water be diluted with an
lsotonlc or weaker suear solution the curve
of the duration of life deviates little from that
with dilution by means of distilled water.

Shortly after the Doric came to an
1 anchor in the quarantine grounds a
Japanese stowaway, belted with a life
1 preserver. Jumped into the water and
struck out lustily in the direction of
Melggs wharf. A boat was lowered
from the licer and in a few minutes the
swimming Japanese was overtaken. He
and another stowaway were then
locked up and will be detained in the
brig until the liner sails, when they
will be allowed the freedom of the coal
and permitted to work their
passage back to Japan.
Rev. "W. N. Brewster, a missionary
' who has been in Southern China for
fifteen years, returned on the Doric.
1 He was accompanied by his wife and
i six children. According to Dr. Br'ew
1 ster's ideas war in the Orient is inevi
table, and when it comes he thinks
Japan and China will take the â¢ field
side by side against Russia. He s^s
the tendency toward a combination ; of
the Oriental races is growing into, a
sentiment which is bound to produce
results sooner or later.
The Doric's passengers Included the'
following named:
Mrs. J. T. Barrnclough. Ju!es Brett. Mrs.

The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's Doric, Captain Smith,
arrived yesterday from the Orient. She
reached port several hours before she
was expected, coming up from Hono
lulu in five days sixteen hours. She
brought 22S passengers and 1430 tons
of cargo. Although small in weight and
dimension the freight represented a
high money value. There were sixteen
boxes of treasure and a shipment of
opium valued at 53S4.O00. There were
620 cases of the opium, and the duty on
it will be $153,750.

Wheat and Other Grains.
... â¢ --,. ; . Â¦ " -...Â¦Â¦.,-. t
WHEATâ Advices from Europe still hing.d
on the weather in the Argentine. A cable
from Buenos Ayres from the agent of one of
the largest manufacturers of farm machinery
in the - Cntted -States - said â¢ that heavy rains
'continue that damage is unavoidable and that
I prospects of the crop are declining..
I Chicago was c lower, with the Northwe3t
1 heavy sellers, of May. . Â¦'. '. . Â¦ ..
""The Chlcag-'o renort of Bolton. Do Ruyter &
Co. Eaidi "Market !s about H cent lower.
Liverpool cables were again a disappointment.
Broomhafl reports a general apathy as to'.the
movement of American markets so long as the
weekly supplies- continue so- liberal.. Ke adr
vises that the world's shipments .will be about
11.000,000 bushels, with very little change on
1 passage. A heavy fall of snow, which is also
; predicted for the winter - wheat belt, helped
! to ease tfco feeling. Primary receipts are. con- |
i f iderable in excess of last ..year. There were
free deliveries on December contracts, and the i
I discount for that option has been thereby in- ;
creased. Armour's operations are. so far" as ,
can -be Been, only cf a scalping nature. He
must be a very large owner of May . w^heat.
Altogether, conditions are such that .a,Confi
dent forecast of the market Is a very difficult
proposition. The price is not low, receipts con
tinue -large the visible will show another in
crease on Monday, and in our Judgment the
market will need the assistance of .more,
strength abroad." . . Â¦. . '

which dragged â¢ at the familiar, quotations.
There were no fresh Sweets received, but car
ried-over stock was abundant and moved slowly
"nt previously quoted rates. Onions ' were â¢ In
ample supply and were rather dull at un
changed prices.
Receipts of Vegetables from Los | Angeles
were light and prices of String and Wax Beans
had' a . further advance under a steady demand
both for local needs and for shipment north.
Peas wererin good request and would have
brought higher prices had the stock been of
better' quality. Tomatoes, ! too, were ' wanted
for Khipment to Puget Sound ports and Los An
geles lots sold at higher rates In preference to
the Bay, - which ' were , frostbitten and other
wise in poor condition. Summer Squash .and
fancy Err Plant from the south were, steady,
but there was some large sized.'. Egg Plant
offering. Â¦ Which could not bs 3old at any price.

Seven .cars- of Western Poultry were mar
keted durinjc the . week and the rtceipts : of
domestic were unusually heavy. The demand
was, lighter than usual, as a large number ef
restaurants were -closed '-during ; the greater
part of the week owlns to labor troubles, and
the receipts proved too heavy; for" the regular
trade to absorb. The market closed the week
dull, with- retailers well supplied and- quite
a quantity had to be carried over. Receipts
of dressed Turkeys were light, but s rhera was
plenty of carrled-over stock offering- and as
the demand ,waÂ«. nothing- extra prices had a
wide range as to quality. -Thin and scrubby
stock was neglected and some: very poor,. lots
sold down tdÂ« 15c per -pound.- '
Game cleaned up. better than at- any time

I Chicago -Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. 12.â Wheat opened steady,
with May %c lower to %c higher at'81%c to
81 %c. but econ. showed decided weakness, in
fluenced by the snows and rains in the wiaier
wheat section and ' selling for profit-taking.
The declining tendency was augmented by the
extreme 'weakness in December, which sold off
l%c early In the day, on heavy, deliveries.
Commission houses were active sellers and
with little demand May slumped to S0%c. But
the advices from Argentina were still bullish,
and reports frpm Minneapolis stated small-sup
plies of wheat in the three Northwestern
States. These features. T together with reports
of a cold wave in prospect, .changed the-senti
ment in the pit and . during the 'last hour a
good demand developed with many .sellers on
the buying . side. The market responded lo
this demand and May advanced to 81 %C. but
eased off again. The close was steady, with
May %@%c lower at 81V,@8lV4c.
Corn for December delivery was weak, nut
May held surprisingly steady in view of the
weakness and the. decline in wheat. After
opening at 43%c to 43%e. May sold between
43%c and.43%c. closing at 43%Â©43Â«c
Oats were firm, on covering by Detember
shorts; the receipts continuing small. ' .During
the last hour there was considerable activity
In the pit, due to a number of local operators

â¢-As Is usually the case on Saturday, the de
mand for fresh: fruits was quite active, but as
supplies of 'all descriptions were, ample prices
had no quotable variance. Yesterday was
shipping, day r for Puget * Soand- ports, but the
demand from that quarter -was light,, as of
ferings of grapes were unfit for shipping and
there was very little , inquiry for Oran yes, as
the. northern markets* were being supplied
direct from the growing- districts. It ' Is re
ported Â¦ that .the British Columbian markets
are overloaded - with " Japanese Mandarins and
are offerins them in this market at 25c per
box, f. ,o. b., shipping points, which, plUJ the
cost -of transportation and duty, would make
the price 45c or 5oc ' per box landed . in San
Francisco.. Yesterday's -receipts' of Berries
consisted^ of 2tt chests-' of large Strawberries
and a rexv chests or -Raspberries. â¢ The Rasp
berries cleaned up readily, while the Strawber
ries were mostfy of poor quality and dragged
at unsteady rates. There was nothing new in
Apples or Pears. Persimmons were unchanged,
with, supplies ample for all requirement.".

KAISER DROPS
IN ON BERLIN
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12â A suit in
volving the famous "Pious fund" of
the Roman Catholic church and pos
sessing an unique historical Interest
Â¦was filed in the Superior Court of Los
Angeles County tc-<iay.
The suit is brought by Miguel
A&uirre. Jose A. Aguirre, Martin G.
Aguirre and Mrs. Dolores Aguirre ile
Pico against Archbishop Patrick Wil
liam RIordan of the Roman Catholic
diocese of San Francisco, Bishop
Thomas Grace of the diocese of Sacra
mento and Bishop Thomas J. Conaty
of Monterey and Los Angeles. The suit
Claimants of a Share of the
Celebrated Pious Fund Be
gin an Action at Law
SUE PRELATES
FOR THE COIN
It is alleged by the plaintiffs that
prior to April 27, 1S30, the Roman Cath
olic church of ; Upper and. Lower Cali
fornia owned property amounting to
more than $1,000,000 Vlthln the republic
of Mexico belonging -to what \va3
known as the "Funda Piodoso de Las
Californias," or the "Pious Fund of
the Californias." This fund was In
trusted to the sole care and manage
ment of the Roman Catholic churcji
for the purpose of converting the In
dians and for the propagation of the
CatholJc religion. , Notwithstanding
this â¢ fact the fund was : seized about
August, 1833, by the Mexica n Govern
ment without the consent. of the;mis
gionary fathers, and down to the year
lÂ«0 was retained by it under the. laws
of Mexico. In 1340 the diocese of the
Californias was established by the
Government and* placed under' the ad-
ix .for an accounting, in .connection
with what is ; known as "The < Pious
Fund of the' Californias,". and ithe case
has its inception in the early history
of California, /when the State was a
part of the Mexican republic. The com
plaint consists of more than fifty type
written pages, and is practically a
history of the Roman Catholic church
in California. '
Garret W. McEnerney, who attends
to Archbishop Riordan's legal business,
said last evening:
-"By an agreement made December 30,
1879, Dolores A'guirre, - Jose* Antonio
Aguirre, Martin A. Aguirre and Jose
In February of the' same year Jose
Antonio A Ruirre. the progenitor of the
defendants, is declared to have ad
vanced to the church, in connection
tilth the fund, the; sum of > t $25,000, and
the f und'. was charged -Vlthythis, debt.
Afterward General - Antonio . Lopez de
Santa^Ana, then provisional President
of; the republic of Mexico, 1 assumed/ the
sole administration, of ; the Â£fuhd : with
the declaration that he -would always
respe?t the wishes; of ; the; founders. xit
again came Into possession of the
church at a , subsequent "date, and its
administration has passed on down
through .the' various -heads of the
church until now it' rests with the de
fendants in the suit. The amount ad
vanced by Jose Agulrre never has been
paid, it is said, and the present suit is
to recover that amount.
