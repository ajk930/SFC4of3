These principles, concludes Mr. Balfour.
direct the policy of the British Govern
ment in the near East and he has no
doubt that they are in accordance with
British Interests and In obedience to them
lies the best hope of improving the con
dition of the Macedonians and the secur
ity of European peace.
Coming to the question of the attitude
of Great Britain Mr. Balfour points out
that Russia, Austria and Turkey cannot
be indifferent to a territorial redistribu
tion in the peninsula, while Greece, Bul
garia. Servia and Roumania are all In
terested in the fate of the province whose
Christian population is made' up from all
their nationalities. These external com
plications are doubled by. internal ones
because of religious differences, the Mo
hommedans fearing Christian rule, while
the Exarchlsts and Christians persecute
the Patriarchists; the Greeks, wh<j are
Patriarchists, would sooner find protec
tion under the rule of tne Sultan than
be left to fight the matter with the Bul
garians, who are Exarchists.
These countries possess. Mr. Balfour as
serts, incomparable influence over the an
tagonistic forces in the peninsula. In
fact, no other nation or group of nations
could do it at all if Russia and Austria
were hostile. Great Britain was not pre
cluded by the policy outlined from offer
ing suggestions, which had already been
done, and she will continue to do so.
But it would be folly to forget that there
are occasions when two " powers are
stronger than three, and that an addi
tion to the number carries a diminution
of efficiency. :
"Neither of these conditions was ful
filled. The Porte, as usual, was dilatory
and failed to see that a policy of human
ity was a policy of wisdom. The revolu
tionists have deliberately done their best
to drive the Turk to excesses and furnish
him with an excuse for deferring the exe
cution of reforms, meeting horrors with
horrors and brutality with brutality for
the deliberate purpose of driving the Turk
to crimes against the Innocent and thus
play upon the sympathies of the world.
Such methods as these are no more mor
ally tolerable than the misgovernment
which is their excuse."

"The instrument whereby the situation

The feeling against Rockefeller was
strongly shown in the village of Brandon,
which is on his property about three and
a half miles north of Bay Pond. ' There
were more than 100 houses In Brandon
about four years ago, ill occupied, and
the community was prosperous. Now
there are about fifty houses and only
fourteen families remain. Some of the
buildings were removed and others were
burned to get them out of the way.
There could be nothing more desolate
than the village as it stands to-day, with
almost all of the houses closed and their
doors and windows barred.
All along the railroad are posted notices
signed by William G. .Rockefeller an

MALONE, N. Y., Sept. 23.â There Is no
doubt that Orrando P. Dexter's murder,
combined with the hostile attitude of
woodsmen, has caused great excitement
at Bay Pond, where 'William Rockefeller
has established the headquarters of his
enormous tract of land in the Adiron
dacks. Rockefeller paid a visit to his
house on Monday and left very soon af
terward. His son, William G. Rockefeller,
has also gone, although some members
of the family and a few visitors are said
to have remained behind.
Large lights have been put up within
the last few days all around the clearing
made for Rockefeller's summer home.
The nearbv station of the New York and
Ottawa Railroad belongs to Rockefeller,
whose superintendent, John Redwood, has
offices on the upper floor. The lights are
so arranged that no person can enter the
clearing at night from the dense woods
that circle it without lieing seen by
guards who have been placed on duty
there. Redwood sent to his employer in

NEW" YORK, Sept. Â£5.â Plans for the
formation of a building trades labor trust
affiliating In round numbers a million
â¢working-men, skilled in these trades, are
reported to have been worked out by
prominent officials of national labor or
ganizations. A conference for this pur
pose has already been held in Indianapo
lis, In vhich leading: officials of several
labor organizations were present in per
pon or by proxy. Among the organiza
tions taking part were the Brotherhood of
Painters, Journeymen Bricklayers and
Masons' International Union, Upited As
sociation of Plumbers. Gas Fitters. Steam
Fitters and Steam Fitters' Helpers, Hod
Carriers and Building- Laborers' Interna
tional Union. Union Brotherhood of Car
penters and International Organization of
Bridge and Structural Iron Workers.
Some of the organizations are attached
to the American Federation and others
are affiliated with the National Building
Trades Council, while still others are con
r.<-cted with neiether of these national
Ixxiies. On account of the various affili
ations of national building trades unions
conflict and confusion have arisen and
the conference was called primarily to
discuss the amalgamation of all build
ing trades union interests and the organi
zation of a national federation of build
ing trades. The delegates discussed many
propositions to combat the tendency of
employers' organizations to make war on
labor unions, to prevent the formation of
dual or rival bodies in the same trade;
to protect the anatomy of unions, and to
form a closer combination of organiza
tions engaged in constructing and repair
ing buildings.
"Most of the unions in the building
trades are affiliated with the American
Federation of Labor and a national fed
eration of unions is not necessary," said
General Organizer Herman Robinson, in
ppeaking of the plan. "No sooner nad
the heads of organizations come together
in a conference to plan a national feder
ation than they took up the question of
politics. Building trades unions do not
need a national federation, nor do they
need a national building council so long
as they are connected with the American
Federation of Labor, -which can take care
of all the unions under its protection with
out the aid of other central executive
bodies of national scope."

SPRINGFIELD. Ohio, Sept. 25.â That
truth is stranger than fiction is again ex

life of Robert Reid of this city, who for
fifty years has been mourned by relatives
here as dead. Reid left in 1S48 for
California to seek his rortune. Time
passed and his relatives heard noth

years he was given up for dead.
Recently an advertisement asking for
the whereeabouts of Robert Reid was in

brought an answer. In a letter received
here from Reid the missing man tells
little about himself. From the history he
gives of his parents, brothers and sisters,
there can be no mistake as to his identity.
He writes that he has been known among
the Indians as "Shokum Bort," which
means strong man. Relatives expect him
here in a few days, when a reunion will
be held. Robert Reid's address is given
as Prairie City, Grant County, Oregon.

I am a pretty old man now and want my
freedom the balance of my days. Of course,
I still believe I could make the bankers "make
good" en the pension idea. A man can do a
lot of harm with a little acid. pulp. India Ink
and a penknife if he knows how and Is xo in
clined. My intention Is to quit the business,
though.
The report so freely circulated within
the past year that the American Bankers'
Association will take care of Becker and
allow him a monthly pension of $300 Is
still believed by many persons. The noted
forger is non-committal on that point,
however. Ho will not affirm or deny the
tetory that -overtures have made' to
him by the Bankers' Association.
Becker is about 65 years old. His so
journ in prison-has materially altered his
physique, but his brain is as active as it
was a quarter of a century ago. During
his imprisonment at San Quentin Becker,
has not been idle, neither has he tjeen
compelled to soil his hands. During War
den Aguirre's regime Becker used to de
vote his time to pen sketches and the
homes of the prison officials are filled
with specimens of his handiwork. Becker
was good to his friends and would ac
commodate them at most any time on
any kind of work. Nothing baffled him,
from a sketch from life to the alteration
of a document. Not more than a few
months aeo he altered a diploma for a
young woman who could notf enter col
lege because her name was misspelled on
a high school certificate. She wished to
enter the University of California, but on
the sheepskin the letter "y" appeared in
stead of "u." The certificate was intrust
ed to Becker and within fifteen minutes
he had corrected it.
In speaking of the alleged pension by
the bankers, Becker said:
San Quentin some time during the morn
ing, but where he will go when he jeaves
the prison is mere, conjecture. He is en
titled to a railroad ticket to any part of
California. AH he wishes, however, is
transportation to San Francisco.

suddenly to-day from apoplexy. He was

ors in the West. His home was at Strong

BULGARIA
IS GIVEN
WARNING
For more than a week officers . have
been looking for Whalen. but he kept out
of sight and after his arrest it was
learned that friends had informed him
that officers were inquiring for him.
After he had been placed in jail he con
fessed the elopement and the desertion
of hl3 family. He took the matter coolly
and even intimated that there is no law
by which he can now be punished. As
to the death of the woman he says that
it was due entirely to natural causes and
that investigation will so disclose.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 25.â Rev. D. I
Whalen, until eight months ago pastor of
a Baptist church at Prattsburg, N. â¢â¢ Y.,
occupies a cell to-night In the city jail.
He has confessed that tfrheri. he left
Prattsburg he eloped with Mrs. James H.
Clark, a member of his church, and' that
he deserted a wife and four children: He
will be held until the authorities of the
New York tov, ; n can be communicated
with and decide what action they will
take. It is possible that he may be ex- j
tradlted to New York and tried there on j
a felony charge. The woman who, gave j
up home, family and honor for him died
In this city August 27. She was ill only
twelve hours, and until now no suspicion
existed that her death was not due to
natural causes, but in the light of more
recent " developments the circumstances
attending her death will be as thoroughly
investigated as is possible after the lapse
of so many weeks.
Whalen appeared here about seven
months ago, accompanied by the woman,
who was only 20 years of age and very
handsome. He introduced her as his
wife. They were welcomed into thowork
and meetings of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union and substantially as
sisted, for Whalen had no money. He
took up the work of the Volunteers of
America and became a prominent figure
at their meetings.
â¢Whalen has frequently preached here
and' to-night was to have led a religious
meeting, but his arrest made that im
possible. â¢ Between his religious engage
ments he peddled a preparation for the
hair which he manufactured himself.'
The couple had rooms at the headquarters
of the Volunteers and Whalen's supposed
wife took active part In religious and
temperance work throughout the city.
During the latter part of August she ac
cidentally fell at her room and within
twelve hours she was dead. It was
Whalen who stated to the physicians that
she had fallen and injured herself. He
Â¦ caused the death certificate to be made
out in the name of Mrs. Whalen Â¦ and it'
was so entered upon the Health Depart
ment records. Ten days later Whalen
wrote to members of his own family in
I New York informing them that the wo
! man had died of kidney disease. He
j gave no address to which they could send
a reply. They tried to find him through
the. church, people with whom they
thought he might be associated, but fall
! Ing they applied to the police.

LONDON. SeDt. 25.â David T. Watson
of Plttsburg. of counsel for the American
ride, continued at to-day's session of the
Alaskan Boundary Commission his analy
xation of the treaty of 1S5. v
Alexander Begg, the unofficial repre
rentatlve of British Columbia, asked the
commission to-day to give an ansv.er to
1:1s application to be heard, which will be
denied. He roundly denounced the action
of Great Britain In running a line through
Portland Channel Instead of north, up
Clara Strait to the fifty-sixth degree, the
effect of which was to leave a large
stretch of territory indisputably in Amer
ican possession.
During the afternoon Mr. Watson dis
cussed the question of the existence of a
mountain chain along the coast, declaring
It was quite clear that the negotiators of
the treaty proceeded with the assumption
that there was a continuous dominant
range around all the elements. Mr. Wat
son said there was no such ranse.
"If such a range existed as depicted on
the maps," interjected A. B. Aylesworth
of Canadian counsel, "we would not be
here."
Proceeding. Mr. Watson claimed that
Great Britain argued that the treaty did
not settle the boundary line, but left it
to be ascertained.
Chief Justice Alverstone says he did not
understand the British argument. Ameri
can counsel considered Lord Alverstone' s
statement to Indicate that he disregards
what is considered to be the main feature
of the British contention. Lord Alver
stone made a few remarks Indicating that
he was impressed by Mr. Watson's
ep<?ech. finally remarlftng:
"Without wishing to flatter you, yours
is a powerful argument."

brought suit against the Southern Pacific Com
pany yesterday to recover $5010 damages for
the death of his horse Tepper,. which wm
killed at the Oakland wharf, some time ago.
During the entire day Leong Kai Chen
and his secretary were carefully guarded
by Detectives George Gibson and George
McMann, who were detailed -at the re
quest of the local reform society, whose
members feared that some agent of the
Chinese Government might attempt as
sassination. Chen, however,, scoffed at
the arrangements for his protection, ; re
marking that he had traveled through
many thickly settled portions ' of China
without fear of treachery and without
even being extended the courtesy of. a
"While thousands of Mongolians crowded
the narrow thoroughfares through which
the procession meandered, the onlookers
remained remarkably stolid as their -hero
passed in review. The parade finally ter
minated at thÂ« headquarters of the re
form association on Stockton street, be
tween Jackson and Washington, where a
reception more in keeping with the dig
nity of Leong Kai Chen followed. There
was handclapping and handshaking. with
speeches of welcome, to which the re
former responded in a cheerful manner.
This function over, the members of tfie
association escorted their guest to the
Yung Fong teahouse, where a light repast
was provided, and then Leong Kai Chen
and his secretary repaired to their apart
ments at the Occidental to prepare for an
elaborate banauet in the evening at the
Jackson-street restaurant. The reform
er's first day in San Francisco was cer
tainly a strenuous one. He was -kept on
the move for nearly fourteen hours, a te
dious ordeal for any man, considering
that he had just finished a long overland
trip when the local receptions began.
GUARDED BT OFFICERS.
The advent of the reformer was attend
ed by a scene entirely new and strange
to Chinese customs .in that the band her
alded his coming by playing "Hail to the
Chief," end after the visitor and his es
cort had been comfortably seated in car
riages a procession was formed and the
march began up Market street to Mont
gomery and thence to the Occidental Ho
tel, where a stop was made long enough
to permit Leong Kai Chen and his secre
tary, Pow Chee, to enter the hostelry and
introduce themselves to the management,
under whose protection they will rest
during their stay of a fortnight in San
Francisco.
From there the procession continued on
its way to Chinatown, where a great
throng awaited the visitor and gave him
a greeting that plainly suggested to the
reformers that their fellow countrymen
are rapidly conforming to the Anglo-
Saxon methods of hospitality. The band
of fifteen pieces, which preceded the pro
cession through the principal streets of
Chinatown, contributed music almost con
tinuously, rendering popular and familiar
airs, such as "Hiawatha," "Anona" and a
few less dignified pieces that the Ameri
can parader enjoys. Only one thing nec
essary to make the reception fully up to
date was the noticeably lacking demon
strations of enthusiasm, which the Chi
nese seemingly at no time are ready to
outwardly show.
STRENUOUS DAY FOR CHEN.
Elaborate preparations had been made'
for his coming and a delegation from tfie
local society went over to the Sixteenth
street station to meet their distinguished
leader and escort him to this city, where
a band of music and 100 or more followers
awaited him at the ferry.
HAILED AS THEIR CHIEF.
LEONG KAI CHEX. vice president
of the Chinese Empire Reform So
ciety, for whose head there Is a
price of 150,000 yen, payable in gold
to any person who is willing to de
liver the same at the gates of the Poking
palace, is a guest of the local members
of his widely spreading association. With
a greeting that any American agitator
might well have been proud of. the noted
reformer was welcomed into the city yes
terday by his Mongolian followers and
during the afternoon and evening he was
accorded a series of ovations, the like of
which has never been witnessed in the
Chinese quarter.
Leong Kai Chen arrived on the early
morning train from Seattle, where he has
been devoting several Weeks among the
Chinese there expounding the principles
of his organization and exhorting them to
join in the movement which has as its ul
timate end the dethroning of the Dow
ager Empress of China, to be followed by
the restoration of the young Emperor and
a more liberal government, in which the
ordinary people of the empire may have
a say in the direction of political affairs.
Last of the Massachusetts.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.. Sept. 25.âCather
ine O. Hoaklns, one of the last survivors
of Massachusetts Indiana, la dead at the
age of 104 years.
"W e are working against Ignorance and su
perstition, which have wrought so much dis
aster to our people. It is possible that some
day in the near future that we may be
strong enough to force recognition from the
Bmpress Dowager and compel this tyrannical
old woman to make concessions of benefit to
China's unfortunate population. Our soclptv
is making great progress, which in itself is
a fact that plainly suggests that the move!
ment of, reform is popular. The ovation ac
corded me on my arrival here to-day |Â» but a
repetition of what has been witnessed in other
cities that I have had the good fortune to
visit. In the United States ouT people havS
greater advantages than those of their country
men at home. Here they have an example of
what they may expect when education -has
taken the place of Ignorance and superstition
They are learning exactly what is needed In
tholr own country and are eager that a change
In the empire shall take place. They have re
ceived the same lesson In Japan and In the
English portion of China. They need leaders
to provide means for their advancement and
they have found them in every courfirv to
which the Chinese have emigrated. //
Leong Kai Chen expects to remain in
San Francisco for at least a' fortnight,
during which, time he will hold frequent
meetings with the local reform asso
ciation and make such suggestions to Its
members as he may regard as for the
betterment of the organization.
FIGHTING SUPERSTITION.
body guard.
The history of Leong Kai Chen and his
work for the betterment of the conditions
of his country Is a remarkable one. Al- '
though only 30 years of age he has ac- j
compllshed more for the advancement of |
his countrymen than all his predecessors j
In their similar movements. His ambi- j
tlon to serve his fellow men is said to }
have developed within him when he was j
a mere boy. According to his own story
he was graduated from thfe Canton Col- j
lege at the age of 12 years with the degree I
of bachelor of arts. At the age of 19 he
was engaged to Instruct the children of I
the old Emperor at Peking and later, I
through his oratorical efforts he was
christened "The Boy Spirit."
EDUCATION HIS SLOGAN.
Finally he left the imperial family and
began to deliver lectures, and next started
a newspaper, known as The World, in
Peking, right under the no3e of the Era-
I-?ror. Education was his slogan and he
preached it everywhere and made it the
special topic of his paprr until the impe- !
rial family began to regard the former i
tutor as a menace to the dynasty. Later ',
.ir.other paper, the Progress, was started :
in Shanghai and the young reformer be- j
gan the work of organizing educational
societies throughout the -central parts of *
the empire. It was about this time that Â¦!â¢
the Empress Dowager took the initiatory I
step toward suppressing Leone Kai Chen I
and the imperial physician, who was the
president of the educational society and
an ardent admirer of the young .editor.)
An edict was issued from the palace
against the further maintenance of the
societies and heads Â¦were lopped off when
ever offenders against this ruling were \
discovered. Finally the president and
the vice president of the organization,
were forced to flee from the empire, the '
former going to Calcutta.
FLEES FKOM THE DOWAGER, j
In making his escape from Peking'
Leong Kai Chen was given protection by
the British Consul General and through
the influence of that official he was taken
aboard a Japanese man of war and car
ried to Yokohama, where he started an
other paper and with the assistance of
his followers in China he began to make
war upon the Dowager. It was then that
a price of 150,000 yen, or $75,000, was of
fered by the Dowager for Leong Kai
Chen's head, and a similar price is offered
for the head of the president of the so
ciety, who is still In the country scruth
of China, laboring among the Chinese
settlements. Some months ago Leong Kai
Chen left the Orient and for a time waa
in Honolulu, and from there he Jour
neyed to Seattle, where he remained long
enough to complete his plans for an ex
tended tour of the United States, through
which he expects to spread the gospel of
education among the Chinese . residents
and strengthen the organization of which
he is the leader.
TEARS NOT ASSASSIN.
Asked yesterday afternoon if he had
ever entertained a fear since he had left
China that some agent of the Chinese
Government might attempt to take his
life, Leong Kai Chen, who speaks Eng
lish fluently, replied, as a smile illumin
ed his clean shaven countenance:
"No, I am not afraid of any such mis
fortune. Even $75,000 will not induce one
of my countrymen to betray me. for I
know that they have too high regard for
me and the movement I am leading."
The .young reformer added that his pa
per in Yokohama had proved a valuable
means of educating the Chinese up to the
necessity of shaping the future career of
their Government. Secret efforts had
Heen made by the Peking Government
to suppress it, but the attempt had failed.
Continuing, he said;
Tfce Chinese Empire Reform Society haa set
out to accomplish much for China and the ef
forts of the organization are already bear
ing good results. Our greatest hope for the
m 8 ?J. va V 0 ,1 Â°i- the emplre lle " Mainly in
the death of the Empress Dowager within the
next few years. Anticipating this event our so
ciety Is laboring to educate the people of the
country B0 that they will, as an organiza
tion, be a powerful lever in the future politi
cal reconstruction of China. Z?

I^ast Monday tbe Phoenix Lake power plant
closed and as a result the working force of
miners in this county was considerably re
duced. Not nearly so many mines are affected
this year by the closing of the plant as haa
been the. case in previous years. The mines
on the east belt continue In operation, while
the Jumper, Dutch and a few other mines on
the mother lode will keep things moving by
means of steam plants. The Sfaanrmut has
laid off 100 men and the Republican Is work
ing with & force of but ten men. The mills
of both mines are shut down. During the lull
it is the Intention of both companies to do
Â«xtenslvÂ« repairing; to mills, altches, etc., and
do development work. The water s supply Is
said to be sufficient for battery purposes, and
those mines equipped with auxiliary steam
plants can easily continue operations through
the dry soeJJU . .
Tuesday there was telegraphed to the Tuo
lumne County Bank from New York $5000, to
be paid to the Doyle brothers. It was in part
payment of the Doyle gravel mine and was
sent by W. S. Estey. In sixty days there will
bo due another $5000, and the final payment of
Â£T5,G00 more will be made In four months.

The Sonora Union Democrat says of
operations on the mother lode:
There is a rumor current in Calaveras
County that . the Utica mining properties
at Angels are to be sold. These include
the Utica, Stickle, Cross, Gold Cliff and
Madison mines, the Union Water Com
pany's system and the Angels electric

inspection that has been progressing, in
which John McKenzie, William Dodge
and Edwin F. Blake have been taking
part. The properties are owned by

Information concerning a new drift
mining enterprise in Nevada County is
published by the Nevada County Miner,
Â¦which says in part:
Arrangements are being made to open up an
other drift gravel mine in this district, and It
Is thought that active operations will begin
before the winter storms set in. Former Su
perior Judge John Caldwell of this city and
J. T. McCall, an old-time mining superintend
ent In the district, but now In Central Amer
ica, are the owners of 250 acres of land which
Is bejievsd to contain the north branch of the
Harmony ridge channel. Judge Caldwell own
ing a three-quarter interest and Mr. McCall
the balance. The holdings Include the Walcott
location of fifty acres and the rl(?ht
to mine SO acres on the Krazier ranch
and VJO acres on the Cable ranch. The loca
tions adjoin and constitute an extension of the
Coldspring claim which haa at various times
.yielded considerable gold. All of the pieces
hava been prospected more or less and are
known to contain pay. In the early sixties
Mr. Walcott, -who was a ditch tender for the
South Yuba Water Company, ran a tunnel for
3OO feet and found the bedrock pitching away
from him. which led to an abandonment of that
enterprise. Mr. Walcott also sluiced out a
pit atxmt twenty-five feet deep and fifty feet
?Â¦quart. It is propost-d to continue a shaft
down from the bottom of this pit to ascer
tain the depth and pitch of the bedrock, then
go down the hill and Mart a crosscut tunnel

By such a tunnel the lead could be worked
to advantage, as there la a good site for the
dump and water could be easily taken In for
washing. The projectors are of the opinion
that It would not be -necessary to construct
a. stamp mill, as they believe the gravel would
within a reasonable time after exposure to the
air disintegrate KUfflciently for ordinary wash
ing. The section where the consolidated prop
erties ate situated has for years been famous
as a rich gravel mining section.

SAM RAFAEL, Sept. 25.â A freight train
on the California Northwestern cajne very
near being wrecked on Wednesday night.
The matter was ke^t quiet by the rail
road officials, but several of Sheriff Tay
lor^s deputies were detailed on the case
and last night they were stationed -at
various points along the line botwecn Pet
aluma and Tiburon to guard against any
further attempt to destroy the company's
property.
It was ths through freight from Ukiah
that came near being ditched. The train
collided with a box car on the muiji track .
at a point near Ignado station, about lu
miles from San Kafaei. The car bad been
run off the puling so that it projected out
on the main track. Just below t.'ie switch
a low trestle was found to be smoldering
as if it had boon set on lire.
The through freight, with Engineer Ed
dy in th<Â» cab, was en route to Tiburon and
fortunately was running at a low rate of.
speed. The crew removed the obstruction
and quenched the burning timbers of the
trestle.
At the United Brotherhood of RaUroad
Engineers' headquarters at Tiburon the
leaders of the strikers were astonished
when they learned of the affair. Both J.
I'na and Charles Hackett were most ve
hement in the declaration that none of
their men had anything to do with the
attempting to wreck the train.
Sheriff Taylor will thoroughly Investi
gate the case.

CAMP YOUNG. WEST POINT, Ky.,
Sept. 25.â With the commanding general
on the ground and all preliminaries dis
posed of, the regular troops from the
Department of the Lakes began arriving
to-day, while others were "leaving sta
tion" in different parts of the country
for the second series of instructive war
maneuvers, the second of their kind un
dertaken in time of peace since the Civil
War. the first having been held at Fort
Rlley, Kans., last year. About 14,000
troops, including militia from Indiana.
Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and
Wisconsin, will participate. The regular
troops taking part represent all arms of
the service except the heavy artillery.
The militia will be represented solely by
infantry and Hcht artillery.
Major General John C. Bates, command
ing the Department of the Lakes, has
issued a lengthy order for the guidance
of the umpires, officers and troops dur
ing the maneuvers.
The automobile as a factor in warfare
already has been given a trial by the

repairs.
as if to draw Mis revolver, it is stated,
and declared he would shoot the first man
to Interfere. Soon after the doors had
been closed and the protest against the
seating of Brophy had been brought up,
a number of the Parks delegation made
the sensational declaration that the cre
dentials held by Brophy from Scranton
had been forged and that it ortglnally
bore the name of J. Reed, which had been
erased.
Instantly there was an uoroar and
heated words -were heard on all sides,
charpes and counter charges of fraud be
ing made on all sides. When the scene
became threatening and it eeemed impos
sible to get the convention out of Its tan
gle. President Buchanan summarily de
clared the convention adjourned without
hour.
KANSAS CITT, Sept. 25Â»-Samuel Parks,
walking delegate from New York City,
caused a split in the annual convention
of the International Association of Bridge
and Structural. Iron Workers here to-day
in a fight to unseat Daniel Brcphy, a del
egate from union No. 2 of that city, but
who held a prpxy from Scranton, Pa. The
charge was made by the Parks delegates
that Brophy's credentials had been forged,
and to prevent a free for all fight that
seemed eminent, President Buchanan ad
journed the convention without hour and
without waiting to put the question.
Later, v/hen President Buchanan, remain
ing away from the hall, refused to recon
vene the convention the Parks crowd or
ganized . a session, placing Second Vice
President Warden of New Haven In the
chair, and unseated Brophy.
President Buchanan declares that the
acts of the rump convention are uncon
stitutional and Brophy says that he will
Ignore the acts of the Parks crowd and
take his seat whenever President Bucha
nan acain assumes the chair.
After the delegates had voted to unseat
Brophy, the chair was requested to notify
President Buchanan of the proceedings
and to invite him to preside over the con
vention to-morrow. Vice President War
den then declared the session adjourned
until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
Delegate Brophy left the hall as soon
as the vote to unseat had been- taken.
"The action this afternoon," said he, "is
unconstitutional. I still claim my seat
and will re-enter the convention when
President Buchanan assumes the chair
again."
A. fight had been made on Brophy yes
terday by the Parks crowd and although
he was seated, President Buchanan ruled,
to prevent endless debate, that any one
who is willing to make a protest against
any of the delegates might do so in writ
ing. Such a protest against Bxophy, de
claring him to be a "scab." was presented
Just before adjournment last evening and
became the first business of the conven
tion to-day.
A threatening move was made at the
door of the hall as Brophy sought en

The last returns have been received by
Statistician Yale for the year 1902. The
work of compiling all the statistics will
now proceed and the full results of min
Â«raJ exploitation in California in the year
1902 will be made public within a very few
days.
Comparing the statistics of the United
Btates Mint at Washington, it Is interest
ing to note that the total output for the
entire United States in 1902 in gold was
$50 ,000,000 in round figures; in silver, $29,
415,000. California is the lowest but one
of the sliver-producing States, but second
as a gold producer. Of the Territories*
Alaska makes the lowest showing in sil
ver output, being credited with a value in
sliver for ISOS of only *4S,760.
DEVELOPING LUZON.
Some time during the coming week the
most complete report of the mineral out
put of California for any year will be
published. In collecting the mineral re
turr.s for California far the year 1302 the
State Mining Bureau and its statistician,
Charles G. Yale, have had exceptional
opportunities for securing accuracy. The
reason of this is that the United States
Government is in the field, gathering sta
tistics for the Census Bureau, and is also
making Inquiries of various kinds, all of
Â¦which c*n be reduced to a%-allable statis
tics. The probability is, as has been pre
viously mentioned in this column, that
tbe total g-old output of California for the
year l&tt will show some falling off as
compered with the year 1!K)1. It may be
interesting to compare the statistics,
â¢which will be submitted next week with
the estimates for California for the year
1302, as prepared by the Director of the
Mint at Washington, on the basis of the
returns from the assay offices.
The Mint returns the California gold
output for 1902 at 11C.S72.100. Colorado
make* a showing in gold, on the same
authority, of $28,458,770; Montana. $4,373,
600; Utah, $C,i.34,500; Alaska. $S,S43,SO0;
South Dakota, $5.1*65,400; Nevada, J2.895,
800; Idaho, $1,475,00?.
The practically Â¦ unlimited quantities of
mineral oil, the vast deposits of copper
that are developed only in part and the
grÂ«a.t variety of mineral products in Cali
fornia in addition to gold, under favora
ble conditions are sufficient to make its
annual output much greater in total than
It has been In many years, in fact, since
the great output of the placer mines in
the earlier years of California mining- his
tory. Oil has been compelled to make Its
market and await somewhat slow substi
tution for coal as fuel. With the proper
demand, the output of oil would easily
equal the total annual output of gold if
not surpass it.

Consideration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. Â£5.â An extended
conference was held at the Capitol this
afternoon between Governor Pardee and
the State Board of Prison Directors. It
was understood that the conference,
which was executive, related to a discus
sion of the main and supplemental reports
filed by the Prison directors w!th refer
ence to the ( recent break of convicts at
the Folsom penitentiary. But from state
ments made by the parties to the confer
ence these reports were mentioned only
incidentally, and the discussion went al
most entirely to the matter of the paroia
system and the management of thÂ« pris
ons generally.
At the conclusion of - .he session Gov
ernor Pardee was asked by The Call cor
respondent as to what had occurred at
the conference.
"Oh," said the Governor, "we merely
discussed the question of paroles and
credits and other affairs relating to tha
prisons."
"But did you not take up the reports
filed with you relating to the Folsom
break?"
"'Of course, that subject was referred
to now and then, as was inevitable," said
the Governor, "but that was not the pur
pose of the conference, and we dkl not go
into those questions."
Governor Pardee said It would be som<Â»
days before he would be prepared to say
anything abont the reports referred to.
"As a matter of fad" he continued. "I
nxve not had time to take r.p those re
ports. I am working now from twelve to;i
fourteen hours a day on business connect-U
ed with my office. I don't propnse to']
work longer hours than those. The re
ports must wait until I get down to
them."
From Prison Director Don Ray It was
learned that the conference related chiefly
to the parole system. "A ciuestlon has
arisen," said Director Ray. "as to what
should be done with life termers who are
paroled. It does not ceem right to set at
liberty en parole a life termer and compel
the StatP to watch out for him all the
time he is out of prison unul he dies. It
occurs to U3 that if a man is ttt to be pa
roled, and he shows after a couple of
years of this kind of liberty that he has
reformed, his sentence either should be
commuted or he should be pardoned by
the Governor. We wanted to submit this
suggestion to the Governor and discusa it
with him. It is difficult to arrange a
meeting 1 of4he board at which he can be
present and so we came to Sacramento.
We did not go into the. matter of the re
ports on the Folsorn break. I cannot dis
cuss what those reports contain."
All the directors left for their homes
after the conference.

Although the day's business was very
large the activity was really confined to
less than a dozen issues. In addition to
the Steel these Included Amalgamated
Copper. Atchlson, Baltimore and Ohio St
Paul, Erie. Missouri Pacific. Pennsylva
nia. Reading and Union Pacific. These
Btockg were traded in all the way from
35,000 shares of Missouri Pacific to 85,000
of Atchlson common"; which was, next to
Steel preferred, the most active issue In
the list.
The same interests offered no explana
tion for the steady depreciation In the
market value of the Steel issues except
to declare that the stock market Is now
In control of "bear gamblers," who are
making the most of conditions that are
largely fictitious and Imaginary.
NEW YORK, Sept. 25.â The stock mar
ket as a whole showed very decided im
provement at to-day's close, and the sen
timent was apparently more cheerful.
Nevertheless the same Influences that
have made more directly for lower prices
during the past few months were again
in evidence â namely, the- extreme weak
ness of United States Steel issues. . The
common and preferred shares, as well as
the 5 per cent bonds, began the day with
new low records, recovered in part on
good support and in the early afternoon
"burst wide open" on a fresh bear raid.
In the' final dealings, while the balance
of the list was showing a very firm un
dertone, another attack on the steel is
sues occurred, and the stocks closed with
net losses of three-eighths and one per cent
for the common and preferred, respective
ly, while the bonds cfosed at 71Â»4 after
touching a new low record of 70%. Deal
ings in Steel were enormous, the total
sales of the etfmmon and preferred Issues
aggregating over 173.000 sharesâ about one
fifth of the day's business. The stocks
were offered In big lots throughout the
day. Trading in the bonds was also of
tremendous volume and completely over
shadowed all other issues in the bond list.
No -particular reason can be advanced
for the continued weakness of the Steel
securities aside from general distrust re
garding conditions In the industrial world
and the apparent lack of support except
at critical periods. One of the day's many
rumors had it that a firm prominent in
the original steel syndicate and later in
the conversion syndicate, had through
necessity sold privately some 50,000 shares
of preferred and 20.000 shares of common
at 60 and 15. The report was flatly denied
by interests in a position to know.
This morning the household goods of
Rev. Dr. Dennett, who changes places
with Rev. Mr. Van Auda, were loaded in
the -wagons and Rev. Mr. Van Auda
started with them for Morgan Hill. Short
ly after he had left the teamster appeared
on the scene and was much chagrined to
think the minister was driving the team
back to Morgan Hill.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 25.â Because a team
ster he had hired became drunk the Rev.
Mr. Van Auda, a Methodist minister, wa3
obliged to mount the seat of a wagon
and drive a four-horse team through the
streets of this city. Attached to the
wagon was a trailer, and both vehicles
were loaded with household goods of the
pastor. The recent j conference trans
ferred Rev. Mr. Van Auda from Morgan
Hill, twenty-two miles south of here, to
the East San Jose church. A teamster
at Morgan Hill was hired by the min
ister to haul the goods to East San Jose
and the start was made on Wednesday.
The driver stopped at all the saloons
along the road, however, and when he
reached San Jose he abandoned his team.
The Rev. Mr. Van Auda arrived here
yesterday and was surprised to find that
his goods had not been delivered at the
parsonage in East San Jose. After a lit
tle search he found the wagons and
horses in front of the Dashaway stables
on Second street, but the driver could not
be located.
The minister was equal to the occasion.
Getting In the wagon he threw out half
a dozen beer bottles he found under the
seat, picked up the- lines and started for
his new home in East San Jose. He pi
loted the four-horse team and heavy wag
ons through the crowded streets with the
skill of a circus driver. The ministerial
air and dress of the driver attracted at
tention along the route and old-time
teamsters were nearly dumfounded by
the meek manner of the driver.

the day truant schools should usually be those
where the home Is in co-onTation with thf

He lives at 1255 Howard street at pres
ent. He absolutely refuses to elucidate
the mystery surrounding the identity of
the little girl. Mrs. Prescott says that
she Is only an agent and knows nothing
of the facts which Locke wishes to con
ceal. The child is suffering from a cuta
neous disease, which Locke avers was
contracted at the house of Mrs. Bean.
Locke says that the body of the dead
woman was shipped back to Maxwell in
St. Louis. He asserts that the expenses
01" both himself and the little one are
paid by the father. Miss Pretty, who is
said to be a nurse, is employed, as the
alleged physician declares, "somewhere
in the Shasta region." Locke says that
he will place the infant in a nice family
and care for it until the father orders
otherwise.
Mrs. Bean asserts that she spoke of the
matter to a reputable physician and that
he said such a course of treatment would
result after a time in the death of the* lit
tle girl. The woman continued feeding
the. infant as she . had done previously,
and when Locke called he became â¢ en
raged thereat. He threatened to remove
the child to another place, and she ;im
mediately referred the whole affair to Sec
retary While of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children. The last
named directed Mrs. Bean to request
Ix)cke to call at his office.
i/ocke called on Mrs. Bean within 'a day.
or two, but refused to see White on the
pround that White was not interested in
the matter. Yesterday Locke, in company
with Mrs. Lydia Prescott of the Chil
dren's Protective Society, took the infant
from Mrs. Bean and placed it with an
other family.
Yesterday afternoon Locke stated that
the child was the daughter of Robert
Maxwell of St. Louis, Mo. The story was
that the physician. Miss Pretty and Mr.
and Mrs. Maxwell started from St. Louis
for California about four months ago.
Mrs. Maxwell gave birth to the little girl
in Denver and died within a week. Max
well, who Is alleged to be a traveling boot
and shoe salesman, returned to St. Louis,
and Locke, Miss Pretty and the baby con
tirtued on their way to this State.
Locke admits that he does not possess
a license to practice in any State. He sub
sequently stated that he had never had
an office. Finally he owned that all the
names he had mentioned might be aliases
and that he was not from St. Louis. He
also said that he had neglected in Denver
to record either the birth of the child or
the death of the mother.
Much mystery surrounds the identity of
a baby girl whose welfare has recently
become the care of two of the city's char
itable societies. The little one's guardian"
is a man who chooses to call himself Dr.
William Locke and who refuses to tell
from what quarter of the earth he comes.
A woman who had temporary custody of
the child tells a story of mysterious hap
penings.
Mrs. Reo F. Bean of 819 Pennsylvania
street advertised about a month ago for
a baby to board. An answer was received
from "Dr. W. Locke" of Frultvale. Sub
sequently a young woman who gave her
name as "Miss Pretty" called at the home
of Mrs. Bean and left the baby. The vis
itor said the child's name was Elsie Max
well, and that Dr. Locke would call reg
ularly to see about the health of the in
fant. He called within a few days and
objected to the manner in which Mrs.
Bean cared for her charge. He prescribed
some castor oil and a patent food and de
parted.

was promoted on July l. 1900, Charles
Hedges and William G. Evens had been
superintendents of the free delivery sys
tem for two or three years. He did not
know when the time Indicators were first
Installed here. \ That Installation was an
experiment and is still being -continued.
There are 2000 in Philadelphia and sev
eral hundred In use in Chlcagt), Sacramen
to, St. Paul and Atlantic City, N. J. The
Postmaster of Sacramento was very de
sirous of having It Introduced In that city,
and th*Â» witness, at the request of the
Postmaster, wrote a letter to Charles
Hedges, superintendent of the city deliv
ery service in Washington, D. C, calling
attention to the Postmaster's letter. â¢ In
this jurisdiction, added the witness, there
were not more than 1000 or 1100 In use.
"Were you ever called upon by the au
thorities in "Washington to make a report
on thp use of these devices?" asked Mr.
Woodworth.
"No t sir." was the reply. "I was never
called' upon to do so."
"Were vnu ever asked by any official
in Washington as to whether these time
indicator devices were working satisfac
torily?"
"I don't recall any particular instance,"
replied Mr. Erwln, "but such might have
been the fact."
NUMBER IN USE.
The proceedings were had upon the re
quest of the United States Attorney for
a warrant of removal of Erwln from Cali
fornia to Washington, D. C, where it is
proposed to try Erwln, together with
August W. Machen and George W. Beav
ers, who were jointly indicted by a Fed
eral Grand Jury In Washington, D. C.
The charges against them are conspiracy
to defraud the Government by corruptly
inducing its agents to enter into contract
for the purchase of a large number of
tlmelock devices for mail boxes at a price
largely in excess of the cost of manufac
ture and of the price at which similar
devices could be furnished to the Govern
ment. It is also charged in the indict
'ment that Erwin and the others, in pur
suance of the conspiracy, neglected to ad
vertise fo/ bids for furnishing such de
vices to the department.
Among those present in court yesterday
were Postofflce Inspector-ln-charge Robert
R. Munro, Postofflce Inspector James
O'Connell and A. J. "Vinlng.
HEACOCK WANTS FACTS. -
Mr. Knight addressed the court and pro
ceeded to argue technically against the
indictment and its validity, but Judge
Heacock interrupted him with the follow
ing statement: â¢
"I may as well state in the beginning
that this court will not listen to any tech
nical questions. I leave technical objec
tions for some other court. _ "We will have
no arguments against the validity of the
Indictmentâ nothing but vital evidence or
argument will be admitted here."
Mr. Knight excepted to the ruling of
the Commissioner and placed Mr. Erwin
on the stand. The witness gave a de
tailed history of his connection with the
department since he became a member of
it on June 27, 1SS7, until his connection
with it was severed two weeks ago by an
abrupt note from the department at
Washington. Ills manner was cool and
self-possessed and he answered all ques
tions promptly and did not show any dis
position to withhold anything. In reply
to Mr. Knight's Questions he said that on
July 1, 1900, he was holding the position of
postofflce inspector, and a year later he
was assistant superintendent of the free
delivery service. Mr. Hedges was his im
mediate superior. The duty of the wit
ness in the ne^r position was to supervise
on the Paclflc / slope the free delivery sys
tem, to establish the service in other
States and to recommend an increase in
the force of carriers wherever such in
crease might be needed. His Jurisdiction
extended over Oregon, Washington, Idaho,
Utah. Nevada. California. Xew Mexico
and the Hawaiian Islands. The time in
dicator device, in his opinion and in the
opinion of all persons with whom he had
conversed, was a necessary Improvement
attached to the street letter boxes, and
the boxes were a part of the free delivery
system, he said.
Proceedings in the matter of -the indict
ment of James W. Erwln, until recently
superintendent of the free sys
tem of this Jurisdiction, were begun at 10
o'clock yesterday morning before United
States Court Commissioner Heacock, and
will be resumed at the same hour this
morning.
Mr. Erwln was represented by Samuel
Knight. On behalf of the Government
United States District Attorney Marshall
B. "Woodworth appeared.
Before the court was called to order Mr.
Erwln spent fifteen minutes In shaking
hands with and conversing with his old
associates in the postofflce department,
Â¦who had visited the courtroom to say
words of esteem and good cheer.

Motherhood is woman's natural destJhy â
actual barrenness is rare â comforting
words to childless women.
Manv jromen are denied the happiness of children simply because of
some curable derangement of the g-enerative organs.
Amonj the many triumphs of L,ydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound is overcoming cases of supposed barrenness. Thousands of
children owe their existence to Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound. This great medicine is so vrell calculated to regulate every function
of the g-enerative organs that its efficiency in this respect is vouched for by
multitudes of women.
Nine Years Without a Child.
"Dear Mr?. Pinkham: â We had been married nine years and
never had children, and now vre have a little baby girl nineteen months
old, the joy of our life. She owes her existence to Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound.
"Before taking Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound I
was a constant sufferer. I had pains in my back and sides, especially
before menstruation. I had doctored but received no benefit. Hearing
so much about the Veg-etable Compound I decided to try it, and after
taking six bottles was cured."â Mbs. T. H. Goulbey, 1223 Nevada St-

One can hardly conceive of a more dreadful, awe

told of a man battling for another's, life and being

of a recent case attracted. the world.
To the ordinary observer who follows the bloody
course of Russian atrocities perpetrated upon the
Jews it seems self-evident that Russia, : gross, semi
civilized and uncouth, is simply brutal in her crimes,
sweeping her victims tcTdeath in savage rage. Yet
in another, field the criminals of the Czar offer a still
more dreadful suggestion in the refinement of fiend
ishness which has prompted them to use poison, the
weapon of the cunning and cowardly. The horror
EVER since he entered the Department of Agri
culture Secretary Wilson has sought to bring
about such a development of our rural indus
tries as would enable us to produce at home every
commodity possible to the temperate zone that is
now imported from abroad. To that end he has
again and again suggested to American farmers the
expediency of undertaking the raising of goats. At
his request Secretary Cortelyou of the Department
of Commerce and Labor has had statistics compiled
showing the extent - f our imports of goat skins and
the amount of profit that might be obtained by men
who would raise the goats at home. The showing is
to the effect that we are now annually importing goat
skins to the value of $25,000,000.
A statement upon the subject recently issued. by
the Bureau of Statistics shows that importers are
ransacking the four quarters of the earth to obtain
the skins needed for manufacture. They are brought
in large quantities from India, China, Arabia and
Russia. The skins are used not only for the manu
facture of gloves, but for a certain style of shoes
which are coming more and more,,into use in this

Venturesome promoters have on hand a scheme to
induce American farmers to emigrate to Cuba. One
would think that the American farmer has troubles
enough of his own without seeking to force upon him
an environment that will make life altogether unbear
able.
Edward has tact, experience and a fine capacity for
saying and doing the rrfht sort of thing at the right
time. His prompt dismissal of the guard in Ireland
was a striking illustration of his quickness to seize
an opportunity for making friends. This^ capacity
serves him well, and as a consequence he is rapidly
becoming a real as well as a titular King. It may
even be that circumstances will so shape themselves
in Great Britain that a King's party will grow up
and make him in fact as well as in name the ruler of
This unexpected revival of kingcraft in Britain is
due mainly to the abnormal condition of the politics
of the kingdom. There is neither a strong Ministry
nor a strong opposition. Neither in the Lords nor in
the Commons is there a man who has the confidence
of the country or even of Parliament to a degree suf
ficient to enable him to govern without the favor of
the King. Indeed it is quite probable that at the
present moment the British people have more confi
dence in the King than in his Ministers and are
heartily glad to have him undertake the direction of
affairs. . "^ -.
KING EDWARD continues to surprise the
world by new exhibitions of a determination
to assert every royal prerogative that belongs
to him. From the day he ascended the throne he
made it plain to all that he did not intend to be a
figurehead. As each new occasion has offered him
an opportunity to manifest his will in the Govern
ment he has been prompt to take advantage of it,
and so sagaciously has he managed to combine firm
ness with suavity that the British public, ever jealous
of aggressions on the part of the crown, have greeted
each successive move with a burst of genuine ap
proval.
. It now appears that the King has assumed a large
share in the direction of foreign affairs and that his
tours abroad, with visits to Portugal, Italy, France
and Austria, were not mere matters of royal cere
mony. So, too, the Irish visit was an affair of high
politics and not a holiday jaunt. The most remark
able evidence, however, of the King's determination
to take an important part in the government of his
kingdom and his empire is noted in the attitude he
has taken toward the reconstruction of the Balfour
Cabinet. The Prime Minister has been summoned
to the presence of the King at Balmoral, and it is in
the royal palace that the issues at stake have been
most earnestly discussed and the comparative merits
of available candidates for the Cabinet most care
fully studied.

THE HONORABLE NOBLE HAM
ILTON, one of the foremost of the
pioneer jurists of California, died
at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon
at his home, 1313 Washington
street, in this city. Last Saturday he was
suddenly stricken with an attack of heart
failure and succeeding pneumonia, added
to his advanced age, caused his death,
which was painless.
Thus passed one of the veterans of the
California bench whose influence was
widely felt in the just administration of
the laws of the State. Born near Law
renceburg. Dearborn County, Indiana, on
February 14, 1822, Judge Hamilton ob
tained his education in the schools of his
native State and was admitted to the bar
in 1845. His father, William Hamilton,
had movedl to Indiana from Greensburg,
Pennsylvania, in 1S12, during the war with
Great Britain, and there married Helen
Frances Sparks, daughter of Elijah
Sparks, famous through the middle west
as a pioneer jurist and Methodist circuit
rider. Through the Sparks family Judge
Hamilton was related to Governor Durbin
of Indiana. When the war with Mexico
was- declared Noble Hamilton promptly
enlisted, and was commissioned a second
lieutenant In Company K, Fourth Indiana
Volunteers. He served under General
Winfleld Scott in the march from Vera
Cruz and in the fierce fighting around the
City of Mexico, filling the position of
quartermaster and being given the title
of major, though never formally ap
pointed to that office.
On returning from the war In 1850 he
was elected treasurer and tax collector
of Dearborn County. In 1852 he was se
lected as a 'delegate to the National Dem
ocratic convention at Baltimore and par
ticipated in the nomination of Franklin
Pierce.
When his term of office expired he
started for the Pacific Coast, leaving New
York on July 15, 1S53. Coming by way of
the isthmus he reached California in Au
gust. Though he had the position of clerk
of the Washington Territory Circuit Court
he decided to remain here. After making
a tour of the mines he settled In Alvara
do, then the county seat of Alameda
County, and there began the practice of
the law,, first in partnership with Joseph
Combs and then with J. B. Townsend.
He was married in December, 1S54, to
Miss Lydla D. Marston, daughter of Cap
tain Jotham Sewell Marston of Maine.
Seven children were born of this union,
three of whom survive.
In 1S59 Judge Hamilton moved to San
Leandro, which had become the county
seat, and in 1863 Governor jLeland Stan
ford appointed him County Judge, to suc
ceed Judge John A. Lent, deceased. At
the succeeding election Judge Hamilton
was duly elected to his place on the bench
as the candidate of the Union party. He
resigned, however, before his term ex
pired and engaged in mining and the prac
tice of his profession.
He followed the county seat to Oakland
in 1871, and in 1SS1 Governor George C.
Perkins appointed him Superior Judge.
The next year he was nominated for the
position by the Republicans without oppo
sition, and though it was the year of the
famous Democratic tidal wave and though
Governor Stoneman carried Alameda
County by nearly 400, Judge Hamilton
was elected by 2800 majority. In 18S6 he
was Republican candidate for Justice of
the Supreme Court, but was defeated by-
Jackson Tem;>le. .â
Refusing: a renominatlon as Superior
Judge, he came to San Francisco in 18SS.
He had been on the bench 14 years and in
all that time but two of his decisions had
been reversed by the Supreme Court. The
last years of his life were spent in this
city in the practice' of his profession. He
retained his mental vigor to the last On
Wednesday Governor Pardee appointed
him a notary public, but the commission
did not reach him during life. He was a
member of Live Oak Lodge of Masons.
So passed . a man who had a host of
friends all up and down the State. Sur
viving him are his widow, a eon, William
B. Hamilton, Deputy Collector of Cus
toms, and two daughters, Mrs. .Edward H.
Hamilton and Miss Nettle Hamilton. The
funeral will be held at 1:3d o'clock to-mor
row afternoon from the late home. The
interment will be In the family plat at
Mountain View Cemetery. '

THE CALL invites careful study of its dissec
tion of the proposed sewer system for which
a bond issue of $7,250,000 is asked. The
growth of the city makes imperative this enlargement
of our drainage facilities. It is no less imperative,
however, that the new system shall be perfect, else
the people will be worse off than they are now. As
the proposed issue is predicated on the plans of the
Board of Works it is highly necessary that those
plans be understood. By use of the map we have
published, and informed by the accompanying text,
the whole situation is revealed.
The plan proposes that the whole drainage of the
city be dropped to zero, that is to say to a level that
will earn* off the lowest drainage. To do this the
whole discharge is dropped so far below the datum
line of the city that the entire flow will be obstructed
by the tides entering the sewer and flowing to the
zero points. If they met there only the lowest drain
age the situation would not be so acute. But they
will meet, practically, the whole outflow of the city,
from the highest as well as the lowest levels. When
a high tide in the sewers, the sewage itself and the
storm water from the surface all meet, as they will in
the rainy season, there will be a condition that is in
tolerable. Every connection will be backed full of
sewage, pipes will burst and basements will be flooded
by the unpleasant fluid combination.
We call attention to this in time in order that the
city may not make an immense expenditure that will
harm instead of help. We have tried to make the
matter so plain that every man can study it for him
self. It is competent for engineers and experts to
give the public the benefit of their opinions and sug
gest remedies that will avert the serious conse
quences of what now appears to be a great mistake.

DISTINGUISHED JURIST WHO
' PASSED AWAY IN THIS CITY
YESTERDAY.
The argument may have no effect upon the Cob
denitc who can see nothing in politics but the vir
tues of free trade, and who would willingly sur
render everything rather than his much-prized theory
of trade and industry; but there can be no question
of its essential soundness. If Britain is to maintain
her empire she must base it on something more than
a sentimental loyalty. She must provide a mutual
interest throughout all parts of the empire, and that
can be^done only by the adoption of some such policy
as that which has been propounded by Chamberlain.
WHILE British statesmen and the public
generally have been discussing the imposi
tion of a protective duty upon foreign goods
at British ports as a matter of economics, and have
opposed or supported it according as they deemed
it expedient or inexpedient from a monetary point
of view, a considerable class of British patriots have
defended the proposed policy as a matter of patriot
ism even while conceding that it might demand of
the people a heavy sacrifice.
One of that class of thinkers, Professor Cramb, has
recently contributed to the London Mai| an elabor
ate argument in favor of undertaking the sacrifice as
a part of the necessary cost of empire. He says Mr.
Chamberlain's policy is but a phase in a movement
which definitely announced itself not merely in indi
vidual politicians but in the English race toward the
close of the eighteenth century. The movement was
an outgrowth of protest against the folly which had
led to the loss of the American. colonies, and con
sisted in a steady progression' toward the establish
ment of the vast empire which now "exists. Cham
berlain's programme simply continues the imperial
movement, but the movement has passed from an
unconscious to a conscious stage of existence, or, as
the professor puts it: "From the state of self
consciousness as a nation Britain is passing into a
stage of self-consciousness as an empire." He adds
that Chamberlain's proposition is "his way of answer
ing the problem whether the twentieth century will
in its course knit more closely the ties of sentiment
which bind England and her colonies by adding to
those bonds the bonds of mutual interest and mu
tual fears."
_After declaring that the future of the world is to
the empires of the world, and that the surrender at
Yorktown is the greatest disaster in British history,
and, rightly understood, the greatest disaster in
America's history, ,he goes on to show that empire
can be obtained only by sacrifice. He says: "The
same power which three years ago made Pretoria
within easy striking distance of London will in the
immediate future place Wellington and Sydney
within easy striking distance of Berlin or St. Peters
burg, Washington or Tokio. But for two'or three
generations to come it means suffering, it means self
sacrifice, it means daringâ such self-sacrifice as in the
time of Frederick Prussia underwent in order to es
tablish her claim to be a nation â it means sacrifice
and it means daring, unless the empire is to sink to
the rank of such protected, if interesting, nationali
ties as Belgium or Scrvia, and, sundering, accept in
its isolated fragments freedom as a dole from another
which in' the game of empire has better known how
to dare. It is as useless to appeal to the gallant lit
tle England which scattered Philip's few lumbering
ships as to appeal to the England of Eadwine. The
empire which ceases to advance has- begun to decline;
the empire which recedes is dead already."
Looking at it from the standpoint of a philosophy
of history, Professor Cramb maintains that the issue
of protection or free trade in Britain at this juncture
involves the larger historic issue of the continuance
â¢of the empire. He sees no reason to be sanguine
that the outcome will be in accord with the desires
of patriots, for, as he notes, the British people, when
confronted during the Boer 'war with the clearest
evidence of the inefficiency of their army, refused
even to listen to a proposition to put It on an effec
tive basis by resorting to conscription. He closes by
saying: "To the nation stern and high destiny then
presented a draft headed 'Conscription,' The nation
refused to indorse it; but, undeluded by our phantom
army corps, the same stem and high messenger, re
turning, presents the same bill, but headed now,
'Bread Tax.' Four years ago we answered in effect:
"Let us have not conscription, but a quasi-conscrip
tion.' If we answer now, 'Tax anything, but not
bread'; if we hugger-mugger once more and say,
'Not protection, but quasi-protection,' in what shape
do we imagine the messenger of fate will next re
turn?" ' â¢ -

Under the title of "Taxation Without Bene
fit" there Is in this Issue a very able discussion
by the editor of The Call of San Francisco of
the policy of mortgaging all property In a
city for the purpose of a public utility that
can supply the needs of but a comparatively
small portion of the city. After calling atten
tion to the elastic meaning of thÂ« term "pub
lic utilities," illustrated by the experience of
New Zealand, and, we may add. of old Eng
land, the article shows that the so called ad
vantages of municipal ownership are deceptive
and mostly due to unbusinesslike cr partial
accounting. In this respect v the article fully
sustains our contention that a correct analysis
of the accounts of any publicly owned and
operated' industry will show that no economic
gain whatever has been made that is due to
such ownership and operation. When such
gains appear they are the result of failure to
charge fully all costs of ownership and opera
tion and relieving the utility from charges and
exactions which are imposed upon the privately
owned and operated utilities with which com
parisons are made.
After making these statements the editor of
The Call dlscu.Â«ses the policy of mortgaging
all the property of a city for the purpose of
owning and operating a utility that can ben
efit but a small portion of the city. In doing
this the point is made that such a policy must
lead to "confiscatory taxation." In this con
nection the statements are made that "the
taxation of one man only for S. benefit he does
not share, nor need to share. Is a violation of
hla rights, which, tolerated, may In other mat
ters be indefinitely extended so that large
masses of taxpayers may be involved in con
fiscation. The Independence of our people be
gan in a protect against taxation without rep
resentation. Is not taxation without benefit.
or the possibility of benefit, as bad. or worse?"
We contend that the bonding of a city for
the purpose of a public service utility is not
only an Improper use of the taxing power, but
that it Is wholly unnecessary. Such an under
taking should be handled purely as a business
preposition. If the property. Its franchise,
grant of power to use public rights of way, in
come, etc., la not sufficient security for the
bonds to be issued on account of the utility it
is not a sound business proposition and should
not be undertaken. A correct construction of
the right to exercise the power of taxation
will forbid Its exercise for an unnecessary pur
pose, or for the purpose of establishing an In
dustry that must be sustained by taxation In
order to enable private users of Its services to
obtain the same at less than their entire and
true cost. When an Industry Is self-sustaining
its property, franchises and income will fur
nish ample security for all the funds required
for its ownership and operation. If bonds so
secured cannot be sold to advantage a govern
ment relaDses into a tyranny, pure and sim
ple, when It exercises its sovereign power to
compel the taxpayers to make investments that
sound business sagacity rejects as unsound.
This Is the point at which the shoe pinches.
Municipal ownership advocates are too shrewd
to rest their case upon its merits as a business
proposition. They know full well that the kind
of estimates and spread-eagle talk, such as
have recently been used In Cleveland to Induce
voters to vote bonds for a municipal electric
lighting plant, would not entitle them to a
moment's eerious consideration by men whose
business it Is to know the value of the securi
ties offered when credit is asked, public or pri
vate. To decline to make a public service
utility Relf-contained and self-sustained by
limiting its obligations to the securities created
by Its "own organization and operation is to
confers it to be an unsound business proposi
tion, and thus furnish an unanswerable reason
why the power of taxation should not be exer
cised for Its creation cr support.
Under the terms of its charter, the BoanT
of Supervisors of San Francisco has full
power, when authorized by a vote of the pecn"
pie, to condemn and take over for public ac
count any or all of the privately owned and
operated public utilities. When this charter
was granted by the Legislature its terms weie
hailed with joy by all municipal ownership ad
vocates, and predictions were freely made that
coon San ' Francisco would furnish examples
o' successful municipal ownership that would
make further trips to Glasgow unnecessary.
But the people" of San Francisco are realizing
that the Board of Supervisors has other busi
ness to do besides acquiring and operating
public service utilities. They are critically ex
amining the business capacity shown in the
management of the business with which the
board is already burdened, and. finding it In
competent to handle that business efficiently,
the people do not regard proven inefficiency
as a good argument for Intrusting the board
with additional responslbilltips, and are with
holding their authorization to undertake the
ownership and operation for public account of
any of the public service utilities. The city of
Cleveland appears to be the only place where
voters are judged to be sufficiently under con
trol of municipal ownership oratory to be ex
pected to accept want of time as a valid ex
cuse for blunders in a department the head of
which is devoting much time and energy in
proving to the people that he has not enough
to do. and therefore is perfectly competent to
manage a municipal electric lighting plant in
addition to his duties as superintendent of the
city waterworks. #In private business an in
crease In the responsibilities of an Incompetent
or overburdened manager Is an unknown prop
osition. But then, private business must be
self-sustaining or discontinued. It cannot ex
act support from taxpayers. This accounts for
the lack of sound business methods in public
work. -
PUBLIC UTILITY BONDS.
The discussion of municipal ownership
of public utilities is at this time oppor
tune. The editorial comment on the ques
tion which follows was made by Public
Policy, a high-class journal of Chicago,
which devotes itself to a correct under
standing of public questions and to the
development of good citizenship. The com
ment of Public Policy is based upon an
editorial in The Call and Â»was published
on September 19, 1903. as follows:
It is a cold business proposition. The city pro
poses to go into business, and the taxpayers should
compel it to do so in a purely business way. All of
the fervid talk about the good example it will set to
the private roads has no application to the matter
after all. If it set such an example it will be only
by starting right and making the city's railroad busi
ness carry its own cost without putting any upon
the taxpayers.
Now it is to prevent this that we demand that it be
made impossible to put any burden incident to the
business of street railroading in this city upon the
taxpayers. If the city is to go into that business
compel it to do so just as a private owner would, by
making the plant support the cost of its acquisition
and administration. It is the only guarantee the
people can have that the business will be properly
administered. The Examiner admits that the cost
of public administration will be greater than under
private or corporate management of the same busi
ness. If this admitted increase in cost cause a de
ficit it should not be put upon the taxpayers of the
whole city, but should be borne by the road and met
cither by increasing fares or economizing expenses,
or by the issue of more bonds, just as a private owner
would meet it.
THE policy of public ownership of utilities is
brought sharply before the taxpayers of San
Francisco in the proposition to make the
Geary-street Railroad bonds a lien upon the city, to
be paid by the taxpayers, instead of a lien upon the
road itself, to be paid by those who need the use of
it. As far as the latter are concerned they have the
road now and enjoy its use at the same fare they
would pay were it owned by the city, and the pri
vate stockholders have to stand the losses incurred
in its operation, if there be any.
The (fall has voiced the sentiments of the wise ad
vocates of public ownership who desire that honesty
and business principles shall be enforced in the ad
ministration of business plants under such owner
ship by insisting that* no bonds therefor be made a
lien on the city, but that they shall be made a lien on
the plant alone. It is so plain a business proposition
that no one has attempted to answer it. The-Ex
aminer glows with descriptions of the plant the city
will put in, which is to furnish all the luxuries of
travel and many of the comforts of home, but it ha,s
not ventured to say that the city cannot do all these
things equally as well if the bonds are a lien on the
road only.
Supporting our contention we have the experience
of every city and of every country in the world
that has experimented with public ownership.
Whether the Government be strongly bureaucratic,
like Germany; autocratic, like Russia, or a repre
sentative democracy, like our American cities, on a
self-governing colony of Great Britain, like Australia
and New Zealand, the result has been the same.
In 1888 the colony of New South Wales, in Aus
tralia, went into the railroad business. The Minister
of Railways soon began complaining of the ineffi
ciency and disloyalty of the employes and the public
of the decreased efficiency and the increased cost
of the service. An attempt was made to have the
administration of the public railways non-political,
under civil service. This policy, though required by
law, was frustrated by the influence of the employes
upon members 01 Parliament, who required their
votes. Mr. Shiels, Minister of Railways, paid that an
expert manager brought out from England found the
railroads of Victoria disorganized, the administration
torn by internal jealousies, and was finally com
pelled to abandon hope of making things better and
resigned and went home.
In the Victorian Parliament the employes pro
moted a measure to greatly increase their wages,
and during the debate a member, Mr. Bennett, said:
"I know there are thousands of men who are far
worse off than those whose pay we are asked to in
crease, and I know the country- cannot 'stand the ex
penditure, but still I am not going to be a fool, and
if this raise go to a division I will vote for it."
This meant that he desired to retain his seat in
Parliament and his place in -politics, and to do so
must seek votes by supporting a measure that he
admitted was inimical to the interests of the coun
try! The polony bonds bought or built the roads,
and the loss in running them was charged off to the
taxpayers, so that the thousands of men who were
worse off than the employes whose wages were raised
by legislation had to stand further burdens in in
creased taxation. By 1899 the railroad deficit
amounted to $17,830,000. Yet the service was poor
and its cost, to those who used it, higher than on
the railroads of the United States.
In New South Wales the railroad administration
reported a surplus of $160,000 for the year 1897-98,
But an expert examination showed a deficit for the
year of $940,000, which had been charged off to the
taxpayers. The effect of such management of the
Australian roads has been to largely increase wages
in the less skilled departments, where the voting
employes are numerous, and to reduce the pay of
the skilled and especially of the expert managers.
The result is a poor service at a high cost. First
class men in administration cannot be had in the
positions that tell in management, and those that do
hold them are permitted to conceal their failures by
putting deficits on the shoulders of the taxpayers.
BONDS FOR A
PUBLIC SERVICE
ARE DANGEROUS
country. . By reason of the enlarging demand the in
crease of the importation of skins has been very rapid
of late years. Thus the statistics show that in 1885
the value of goatskins imported was about $4,000,000;
by 1890 it had grown to $9,000,000, by 1898 it was
$15,000,000, in 1900 it was $22,000,000 and in 1903
$25,000,000 in round numbers.
To meet the increasing demand American farmers
are doing very little. A summary of the report of
the bureau says: "The census of 1900 showed the total
number of goats in the United States to be less
than 2,000,000 in number, and when it is understood
that the skins of probably 20,000,000 goats were re
quired to make the $25,000,000 worth imported last
year it would be seen that the supply from the United
States could have formed but a small share of the
total consumption. Yet the fact that a large share
of our supply of this important import comes from
India, China, France and Mexico suggests that there
are large areas in the United States which might
produce goats successfully and in sufficiently large
numbers to supply the entire home demand."

The Only Thing That

DID you ever stop to realize what it is in life that really interests
you the most â outside of eating, sleeping and being merry, of

Â¦ and gone age, or isn't it life itself â tense, eager, puisating life â the very
â¢ things that the other fellow does that you do yourself? Just take note
; of the following:
:.â "The job of front-end brakeman on a mountain division is no great
â¢ stake for a man ordinarily, but it was one for me just then. We knew
! when we went into the superintendent's office that somebody was to get
â¢ fired; the only question was who â the train crew or the operator? Our
â¢ engine crew were out of it; it was up to the conductor and to me. Had
: the operator displayed red signals? The conductor said no. I said no.
i the operator said yes, but he lied. We couldn't prove it; we could only
â¢ put our word against his; and, what made it the worse for me. my con-
Â¦ ductor was something of a liar himself.
â¢ "I stood beading in a cold sweat, for I could see with half an eye
j it was going against us. The superintendent, an up and up railroad man
: every inch and all business, but suspicious, was leaning the operator's

: butâ is it? Perhaps you've been in the same fix yourself. It is not new,
â¢ "but it always will be to the man who has the experience for the first
â¢ time, and oh. what awful possibilities it portends. It is a situation that
! every man who works constantly stands in awe of. Can you etiess how

â¢ first for Frank H. Spearman's thrilling two-page narrative of 'The
! Trainmaster's Story" in the next Sunday Call. It is the second in this
: remarkable series.
: ." Of course you're reading "LeeTVnd Leaven," by E. W. Townsend,
â¢ the famous author of "Chimmie Fadden," which is nothing short of a
j ten strike even in the Sunday Call's comprehensive literary policy of giv-
: ing you the best novels of the day by the very best writers in the world.
I And then there are the two full pages of "Half-Hour Storiettes,"
: the most fascinating literary craze of the hour. And there is also "The
â¢ "Philanthropic Whisper." by Edwin Lefevre.
; And of course you're reading Thojnas Fitch's "Recollections and
; Reflections of the Bonanza Kings Who Put a Girdle of Gold Around the
j World, and the 'Letters of a Self-made Merchant to His Son" and the
: "Oracle of Mulberry Center" and"Why Good Men Go Wrong." bv "The

The powers of Mrs. Kate Moseley, as
guardian of Elva Tompkins, a 17-year-old
girl, were suspended by the Superior
Court yesterday pending an Investigation
Into her conduct as guardian. The sus
pension of Mrs. Moseley is due to the
filing of a petition by Miss Tornpfc^ns in
which she charges that her guardian has
abused her trust.
According to the^ petition Mrs. Moseley
has given her son, Frank Moseley, a gen
eral power of attorney over the estate of
her ward. Miss Tompkins says that
Moseley has used it to further his own
ends and has made out for himself a bill
of sale of a one-half interest in the small
store that comprises her estate. She says
that she has received nothing from him
for her interest and says that Moseley
has not given a cent to his mother on her
account. Miss Tompkins also says that
the Moseleys have taken her from school
and have informed her that she must
seek employment.

GIEL ACCUSES GXTABDIAN
OF ABUSE OF HÂ£B TRUST
It appeared from the evidence that the
complainants had bought 150,000 shares at
10 cents per share and after the report
had been published they were offered
from $1 to $1 60 per share for the stock.
In the suit filed by Senator Sanders of
Montana and his partners, J. V. Sanders
and Louis V. Sanders, of the same State
against Maitland B. Graves the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals has af
firmed the judgment of the lower court.
The suit was brought In the District
Court of Montana to recover $25,000 from
Maitland E. Graves for professional ser
vices. The evidence was to the effect that
the complainants were instructed by tele
graph to report on the Ruby mine In
Montana and they sent an expert to do
the work. The attorneys forwarded their
report as requested, but Graves refused
to pay the fee on the ground that It waa
excessive. The Jury' In the Montana court
gave the Sanders party Judgment for
$4000 and this Judgment has been affirmed
by the appeal court.
Judge Morrow In delivering the opinion
of the court said:
â¢ "It Is difficult to apply to such services
any fixed standard by which they may
be measured and their value determined,
as can be done with reference to services
purely professional. There is a tact and
skill and a happy manner with some per
sons which render them successful as
negotiators, while others of equal learning,
attainments and intellectual ability fall
for the want of these qualities. The com
pensation to be made in such cases is, by
the ordinary Judgment of business men,
measured by the results obtained. It is
not limited by the time occupied or the
labor bestowed."

The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that Eunice "Westwater was not entitled
to damages from the officials of Grace
Church for having been dismissed at
?hort notice. It appears that ehe was en
gaged to elng in the choir in 1S93 on a
contract which provided that ehe would
rot leave nor could she be dismissed from
her position without a six months' no
tice. She was dismissed suddenly in 1S35
and brought suit for 110,000 damages for
elckncEs and humiliation, which were al
leged to have been caused thereby. The
Supreme Court holds that she should be
entitled to nothing beyond what she actu
ally lost by the breaking of the contract.
The Judgment of the Superior Court
was upheld in the guardianship case of
Mary E. Daniels. Mrs. Margaret Halpin
petitioned that the Union Trust Company
be made the guardian of Mrs. Daniels on

Besides these lying at anchor were the
French ship Ernest Reyer, British ship
Whltleburn, British ship General Roberts,
British ship Linfield, schooner James

smaller craft.
In all fourteen great ships, all heavy
laden with rich cargoes from different
parts of thÂ© world, passed In through the
Golden Gate and came to anchorage,
awaiting: assignment to their respective
docks, where they will unload so soon as
berths are ready for them. In che fleet
were seven ehips from Newcastle; they

The special session of the Grand Lodge
cf the Ancient Order cf United Workmen
closed its labors late yesterday afternoon
and the new plan of assessments preparod
by the Supreme Ledge was adopted by
a vote cQual to live to one.
At the morning session the grand body
after being caJled to crder by Grand Mas
ter Workman Crowning: again went into
committee of th<Â» v.holo for the purpose
cf the further consideration cf the very
Important quorticn. Grand Foreman Dun
ton spoke at .some length on the line of
adopting: a plan which had been presented
before the Supreme Lodge in 1S56. on the
ground that Its policy was a beneficial
ore 1 and not so radical as the one that
had been presented.
He was followed by Representative
Dag-g-ert, who offered a plan which he had
evolved and which Included the raising
cf a special tax for the purpose of wip
ing out the present indebtedness of the
national Jurisdiction and the collecting of
a rat* monthly which, he claimed, would
t>e adequate to nut all possibilities in the
xine of obligations in the jurisdiction of
t-'aliforr.ia. He occupied the greater part
3pf the morning session In the discussion
of his idea, but by the time he got
through an<1 statements had been made
by Past Supreme Master Workman Wil
son of Detroit. Mich.. It was apparent
that the proposed plan could not. under
the laws of the order, be carried to a suc
cessful issue, and it was made to appear
that the idea of 1ST<6 supgested by the
grand foreman as the logical conclusion
to be reached waa not acceptable for the
reason that after men reach the higher
ages the rates would be so high as to be
come prohibitive.
At the afternoon soeslon the committee
cf the whole rope and reported progress
through PaFt Supreme Master Workman
Jordan and recommended the adoption of
amendments necessary to carry Into ef
fect the Supreme Lodge plan as they
would be submitted by the committee on
laws. The matter then became the sub
ject of discussion by the Grand Lodge, on
e motion to adopt the proposed amend
'ments, which were read by Grand Re
corder Spencer, and which included the
plan of the Supreme Lodge to the level
rate and the classified plan, also the adop
tion of the guarantee fund as arranged
by the supreme body.
After discussion for some time the mat
ter was brought to a vote, with the re
cult that out of the thirty-six grand of
ficers, eight being absent, twenty-eight
voted in favor of the new plan and on
agairist. The vote of the representatives
was 2fiO in favor and 53 against.
After the announcement of the vote
Deputy Grand Master Workman Hirsh
berg moved the adoption of a vote of
thanks to Past Supreme Master Wilson
and in dofr.g so spoke in glowing terms
of Mr. Wilscr/s zeal for the order and the
gocd he had done for it in California by
placing the new idea In a light that it had
never before been placed. The motion
was seconded by Past Grand Slaster
I?arnes, Grand Foreman Dunton and Past
Grand Master Freeman, and when it waa
put it was carried by a rising vote and
three cheers for Wilson.
The new rates will go into effect on
January 1 next.

The easy victory won last Sunday by
the San Francisco County team from the
representatives of 4 the Alameda Cricket
Club placed the championship of 1003 be
yond doubt in the hands of the new club.
While there can be no/ doubt that the
strongest team wort, there is a general
feeling among cricketers throughout the
State that the San Francisco County Club
has carried the policy of absorbing all the
best players rather too far. the result be
ing that none of the elevens can give It
an interesting match. B. Kortlang, H. B.
Richardson and E. H. Wllkes are strong
er players than any In the ranks of {he
other city clubs, while B. G. Sloman, E.
letersen and P. R. Johns are exceedingly
useful members of an eleven. The cricket
during the past season would have been
more even and Interesting had Kortlang
remained with the Pacific eleven and
Wilkes continued to play with the Ala
meda team*. As It Is, there Is no team in
the -association that has any chance of
beating the San Francisco County eleven
except by one of those flukes that happen
occasionally In cricket.
AN Interesting match is expected on
the ground at Webster street,
Alameda, to-morrow between the
Alameda and Pacific cricket elevens. Both
these old rivals have been passed in the
struggle for the championship of the
present season by the new club represent
ing San Francisco County. The following
will wear the scarlet and black of the
Pacific Club: H. C. Casldy. captain; F.
Bennion, E. H. Lannowe, H. D. Bowly,
A. W. Wilding, W. Petherick, E. T. Lang
dale, C. C. Y. Williamson, Dr. O. N. Tay
lor, T. W. Tetley and W. G. Fortmann.
The Alameda eleven will be chosen from
the following: Harold Ward, captain; F.
J. Croll, B. Bird, J. Bird. Harry Bird, W.
J. Richter, F. A. Stahl, W. H. McNaugh
ton, J. H. Saunders, J, Cowie, V. Seebeck,
C. Banner and R. B. Hamilton. This is
the last match to be played by the Ala
meda cricketers during the present sea
son.

Al Hampton and Joe Collins, the best two
players on this coast, will meet for a spe
cial trophy.
A match game of handball will be
played to-morrow afternoon at. the club
by George James and Louis Levy. This
will be their second meeting. The players
are evenly matched. James is the winner
of many tournaments. Levy is a new
player, who has developed considerable
skilt.
The hard ball tournament will be in
doubles. Among the experts who will
take part are Starr, Cunningham, Corey,
Levy, Gleason, McElroy, 8ulllvan, Pock

three courts on the roof, where the soft
ball players hold forth, are always crowd
ed. It is hard to get a court in the after,
noon, as there are scores of players wait
ing for a game.
The crack soft ball players of the club
are Tom Magee and Richardson, the well
known cricket player. As a team Magee
and. Richardson are unequaled. Henry
Russ and Otis Crable tried to take their
measure, but failed. Magee is a heady
player and kills with unerring accuracy.
Richardson is powerfully built and slams

Ins will be held.
The annual election of officers of tho
California Tennis Club will be held to
day. The nominating committee, com
posed of Judge Hunt. Dr. Lovegrove and
Grant Smith, arranged the following
ticket: W. S. MacGavln. W. B. Collier,
Dr. Lovegrove. Dr. Noble. Frank Mitch
ell, Harry Haight and Grant Smith. ThÂ«
new men are Drs. Noble and Lovegrove.
Crowell resigned from the club a short
time ago and Stauf has expressed hia un
willingr.ess to again be president. It is
expected the ticket will no through with
out opposition. The polls wlllibe open
from 9 a. m. until 5:30 p. m. A meeting
will be held by the new board this after
noon for the election of officers.
The handicap doubles tournament com
menced on the park courts Ia3t Sunday
will be completed to-morrow. The handi
caps last Sunday were not as good aa
usual, but the six teams left in the run
ning arej well handicapped and tho
matches should all be close. The two
scratch teams entered are still in, one in
the upper half and one in the lower. In
the upper half Harry Routh and Charles
Dunlap (scratch) are In the semi-finals
and will play the winner of the match be
tween George Janes and H. Russell (2-6)
and R. N. Whitney and Jules Brady (3-6).
A3 Janes and Griffin allow Whitney and
Brady 1-6, they should not have much
difficulty winning. Many pick this team
to play in the finals against thÂ» Baker
brothers. The latter have two matches
to play in their half, but should win them
both. They play Teller and Otis (5-6)
first. If they win they will meet Mann
ard Finnegan (4-6) in the semi-finals.
The latter caused quite a surprise last
Sunday by their good work and a repe
tition to-morrow will make them danger
ous opponents. The finals will be played
at 2:C0 and the onlookers will undoubt
edly be treated to an interesting match.

DARK OUTLOOK
FOR THE HOME
BALL TOSSERS
The most interesting fight going on is
that between Heltmuller, Howard and
Forse for a place at tackle. Heitmuller
Â«nd Howard would have the right and
left positions safe at any other time, but
Forse Is playing such a keen game that
The most important event in the varsity
circle was th* return of Hudson and Helt
muller to the game this week. Hudson
has recovered from his recent illness and
Heitmuller from his Indisposition to play
nt all, so the team is strengthened in the
end and tackle departments. Johnny
More Is still flirting with the game.
Whether he will be seen on the gridiron
--.cain thin year is a secret nobody but
More knows.
The weakest places In the eleven are
the tackles and ends. Clarke, Haley, Eg-
Ktrs and Seabury have been tried out for
tackle, and Camlnetti. Davis and Bowles
for ends. With the exception of Caminettl
none have proved to be perfectly satis
factory.
As for the other positions. Keen sterns
to be about the best there Is In backs.
Sanborn is another good one, but just at
present he Is among the wounded. There
are others playing for these place*, how
ever, and Dyer, Crow and Gabriel have a
fighting chance to squeeze into the ranks.
Fells 5ecms to have the lead for quarter
back, but Hanna Is right up to him. There
is a fight on between Haffee and Barton
for center, with no choice. Jackson and
Allen, both big men, seem to be fixtures
for right and left guard. Caminetti is
sure of a place at left end.
The inability of the team to score
oftener may be due to the almost com
plete change In the make-up of the team
In the case of each second half. It may
be due to th? brief time the players have
been in training. But even a second
eleven ought to have done better against
teams of lighter weight and less train
ing that went through the games with
out changing.
The freshman team will lose one of its
best players in Boothe, the fullback, who
has been found to be ineligible through
hia b*ing a limited student. Boothe is
the best man for the position, but the
team will have to part with him under
th? rules.

Wednesday was a groat disappointment

Is putting up a game at quarterback that
ranks him a close second to Captain Bans

and running in punts and puts up a gritty
article of ball. Bis "Jim ' Weller, '07,
has the strength, build and speed neces

seen at Stanford. With him It seems
merely a question of learning the game.
To-morrow the varsity will meet a team

played served to give the enthusiasts
(something to talk and to think about, and
so in the absorption of that subject the
varsity team and all things else ath

The freshmen have won the three

was the inability of the team to score

CY. RUSSELL made that regular
annual break into the California
League yesterday at Recreation
Park. He will not pitch any more ball
here this year, because if the fans hear
about it they will cut out going to see
ball games. He Is credited with many
bad showings during the last five or six
seasons he tried to shine as a big
leaguer, but yesterday waa really the
limit. So bad- was he that the home team
won â 14 to 1.
When that bunch of Harris' can make
fourteen runs off one pitcher he must
be an awful tramp. But they did It with
Cy., and he rs now known as the worst
in the world by the baseball-loving
"public.
They began in the first inning to wal
lop the offerings of Russell and never
for a moment did they ease up. Every
one was hammering the ball around, and
those who did not hammer It were treat
ed to bases on balls. In all, sixteen good
solid hits and eight passes to first tell
the tale of agony. Then the Senators
; - started to make errors Just as soon as
Mr. Russell was giving them the office
that he intended to settle down and be
pood. Then he would take another ariel
ascent. He generally neglected to alight
till many runs would be piled upon the
lengthy score.
. Hodson was in good form, and in only
one inning could they land on his shoots.
That was the fifth, when Truck Egan
scored McLaughlin with a three-bagger.

Bookmaker Caesar Young departed for
Los Angeles last evening. The meeting
at that point, which opens on October 10,
will be conducted on the syndicate plan,
from all accounts. Before leaving for the

stalls reserved for his horses. This dis
poses of the rumor that his colors would
not be seen acain at Oakland.

The holder of an "out" on the Cash
Club, calling for $7 from last Saturday's
meeting at Oakland, can collect same on
presentation of the ticket to Secretary
Percy Treat of the California Jockey
Club.
Charles Boots has applied for thirty
stalls at Tanforan track. This means
that the popular owner of Elmwood farm
will race a big string the coming winter.
Barney Schreiber quite recently applied
to the California Jockey Club, by letter,
for thirty stalls at Oakland. Last season
Barney tried to conduct a healthy purse
colecting business with, a poor bunch of
racing hardware. The campaign, so far
as the stable was concerned, was much
of a frappe affair, but this next trip the
St. Louis penciler will bring out some of
his best material. Buchanan Is doing his
riding.
Judging from an application made to
Secretary Treat for forty stalls, Walter
Jennings will race here on an extensive
scale.
There Is money in laying combination
odds when the play comes right. The
combination book at Seattle earned $12,000
during a flfty-six-day meeting.

Last season George Rose had the privi
lege, which earned him something more
than $Ji000. John Condon is the owner of
Harlem track and the central figure in
Chicago racing at the present time. He
Is also a heavy stockholder in the Cali
fornia Jockey Club. Rose was a seeker
for the privilege again this season, but
the bid of the Chicago turf magnate ex
ceeded that of the California layer of
odds.
When the first of the Futurity candi
dates were paraded this spring the Fetter
Free-Motto litter, owned by Frank Mc-
Comb, was thought unbeatable. They
won a number of stakes, and were pro
nounced in a class by themselves. T. J.
Cronin then brought out Fair Tralee,
which assumed the lead in the young di
vision at once. I His prospects were
dimmed recently when he broke one of
his toes. This interfered with his train
ing and has injured his chances, ap
parently. , "
The experts on form figure both he
and McVey will win their first trials to
day. This will bring them together to
morrow morning in the first round.
Mi Amigo, C. C. Griswold's representa

should then continue on his wlnrflng ca

P. J. Horgan, Dr. F. P. Clark and D.
Walsh, representative up country cours

their hounds are fashionably bred and
have . had considerable experience In pri
vate trials.

In 1900. It was worth $3000 and was won
by Frank Jones* Harlean Gladj-3. The

NEW YORK, Sept. '2o.-The big
event at the Empire City track
to-day was the effort of the
champion gelding. Major Delmar, to beat
his record of 2:00Â»i and to beat the world's
record of 2:00. held by Lou Dillon. He
trotted a wonderful mile and in a game,
but tiring finish, shot under the wire
equaling the record time of Lou Dillon.
After a preliminary warming up the
gelding champion came out for his great
trial at 4:30. He went round the first turn,
broke and came back. At the second at
tempt he went away as steady as a clock
and though a slow beginner, got to the
quarter in :3OV4. Up the back stretch he
shot with such lightning rapidity that he
flashed by the half-mile pole in 59 sec
onds. Then the spectators in the grand
stand rose and cheered as the gallant son
of Delmar flew round the top turn to the
three-quarters pole in 1:29. He came
homo to the wire in 2:00, thus equaling
the time of Lou Dillon. It was a splendid
performance by the animal, which
changed owners yesterday at the high
est priceâ $40,000â ever paid for a gelding.
Major Delmar is a New York animal,
bred, foaled, trained and owned in the
Empiro State.'
Two running horses, hitched to sulkies,
were provided for pacemakers. The
pulky, equipped with wind shield, was
driven by George R. Shears, the regular
trainer for E. E. Smathers, Major Del

SAN JOSE. Sept. 25.â The fruit season in
the valley is nearly over and It is esti
mated that the aggregate shipments this
year will equal those of last year. In the
matter of prices the showing will be bet
ter, the returns from all grades of green
fruits sold East since the opening of the
season being one-third more than the en
tire receipts last season. The canners are
pleased with the season's output. The
cherry crop, while but one-half of last
year, was the finest produced in years.
The apricot crop turned out larger than
anticipated and the fruit was excellent.
The poaches were lan<c and fine and the
prices fair. The Bartlett pear- crop was
not large, but the pears were magnificent
as to size and quality. The apple crop
Â¦was fairly good. The prune crop, while
not more than half the size of last year's
crop, was of fine size and quality. It is
mostly on the trays, with fine weather for
drying. As this season was earlier than
last, the prospect for a clean-up before
the rains set in is good. The growers are
hoping for a 3*4 cent basis, owing to do
mestic and foreign conditions.

of a suit at law. Some time ago Jacob
Soares, messenger in the Governor's of

citizens and named it Columbia Lodge.
It happens that there Is a Pythian Colum
bia lodge of long standing made up of
white citizens, and when they heard of
the assumption of the name Columbia by
the lodge of colored men they rebelled.
They asked that the name be changed,
but the colored Knights declined to con
sider the request, saying they were or
ganized under a charter granted by the
Supreme Lodge of Colored Knights of
Pythias, with headquarters in Massachu

Company, the California Northwest
ern Railroad Company and the North

it was made a committee of the State
Board of Trade, but it has proceeded in
dependently with the consent of the State
Board of Trade.

organizers of the Promotion Committee,

ransacking tlae rooms while tlie various
families were partaking of luncheon.

"This university has a democracy that

not- here the snobbishness of the colleges
of the East. To the college girl I would
say, 'Receive the men students on an
equality, even if they don't wear dress

you are a student, be a good, loyal stu

Brief addresses were made by Ezra De

his Inaugural address, declared that our hopes
as a free people, the protection of property, our

but on the religious obligations of an oath.
Every, of flew, of. State, from President to po

STATE BESTS ON RELIGION.
In two schools â one exclusively for secular
training, the other for both secular and re
llgioux training â the same curriculum, tho
same books,, the same examination of teachers
would and should obtain. The result would be
that those who really believe in dogmatic re
vealed religion would build school houses at
their own expense and oiler teacher* qualified
to teach secular branches, to be accepted or re
jected by the .school boards of the State. And
before the money had been paid the Btata
could see that the secular instruction had been
given. Having given satisfactory secular in
struction the teachers could in their own way
impart that religious Instruction desired by pa
rents. This would solve the vexed problem.
Besides the Roman Catholic* and German
Lutherans â who support private schools, not In
protest against secular training â nearly all the
leading Protestant denominations are asking for
more religion In the schools. There can not be
more religion in the schools, as now organized
and endowed, without gross violation of the
rules. The modification would not change, but
broaden the system. The schools where no re
ligion is taught would remain the same as at
prevent. . -
Many people say that religious Instruction
should be divorced from secularCtrainlng in all
schools supported by the State. The Catholic
Church holds that a proper Interpretation of
the letter and spirit of the educational and
religious Institutions would develop a plan by
which the State may profit by all the religious
forces without compromising the principle of
withholding etate aid from the teaching of re
ligion. The State is not hostile to religion.
Then why should not the State pay for secular
education In those echools where Methodism or
Eplscopalianlsm or Catholicism is taught?
Why should tfce State concern Itself as to who
Imparts secular education?
ETHICAL LESSONS NEEDED.
Law is simply a reflex of the character of
the Individuals that constitute eociety. The
two great factors forming the character of
the individual â hence of the social body â are
religion and education. The great economic
problems that press upon .tho age must be
solved by the educator and the churchman.

LONDON. Sept. 25.â General Indignation
has been aroused here by a dispute be
tween the postofflce authorities and the
management of the London and North
western Railroad over the payment for
the transportation of mails, by which the
American malls have been seriously de
layed at Liverpool when, under excep
tional circumstances, they have not beea
handled at Queenstown. It appears that
the railroad disputes its liability to carry
to London a larger portion of the Atlantic
mail than can be stowed away in an or
dinary boat train without extra payment.
The recent arrival of the Umbria mail
brought matters to a head, the railroad
officials refusing to forward the surplus
mall bass until the postofflce agents pay
the cost. Confronted unexpectedly with
this ultimatum the postofflce complied un
der protest. On the arrival of the,Etruria
September ID the railroad took up a simi
lar stand, but on this occasion the postal
authorities stubbornly declined to comply
with the conditions. Consequently, hun
dreds of mail bags brought by the Etruria
were left at the pier and were forwarded
to London in small numbers, aa the ac
commodation* of the postal cars of the or
dinary trains permitted, the last portion
of the Etrurians mail not leaving Liver
pool until Monday.

In order to preserve the water while
not in use the Indians have built a little
reservoir about the spring and from this
the water Is diverted in ditches to the
various tracts which the tribe has under
cultivation. The notice posted by Tanby
was discovered yesterday by the Indians.
Instantly every member of the tribe hur
ried up the side of the mountain to get
a glimpse of the offensive notice. There
was not one of them who could read it,
but the older members knew that lta
import was not of a welcome nature. The
aged members of the tribe, old men and
women, broke down In despair, wrung
their hands and wailed doefully, while
the stalwart braves grunted scornfully.
The Indians have appealed to the Gov
ernment and should they receive no an
swer trouble may be looked for. Tanby
wants to get the water to irrigate his
orange groves in Highland.
SAN BERNARDINO. Sept. 23.â F. W.
Tanby has caused considerable trouble
among the San Manuel Indians by enter
ing upon their reservation above High
land and posting a notice appropriating
all the water in the one spring on the
place, for upon its supply the Indians de
pend absolutely. It was only a small
spring bubbling out of the mountain side
when the Indians first went to the place
twenty-five years ago. They set to work
to develop it and have succeeded in get
ting a steady flow of about five Inches.

"Go home," he said to the bankers,
"and tell your merchant^ and manufac
turers and railroad people that you are
still doing business at the old stand and
expect to remain. Stand by the business
interests of the country and all will be
well. The prosperity of the American
people is not measured by the price of
stocks and bonds, but by the output of
our farms and factories and the profitable
employment of labor."
The Secretary said that we either must
issue more bonds as a basis of national
bank circulation or provide some substi
tute. The present volume of Government
bonds, he said, was insufficient, and a re
cent demand for $6,000,000 of Government
bonds had consequently advanced the
price of Government bonds to a figure
that made national bank circulation un
profitable. But,' he added, any currency
system adopted must provide for ex
changeability of every form of money, so
that our people would never have cause
to look twice at bills presented in the
regular course of their business. Speak
ing of the functions of a bank, he said Its
success should not be measured by Its
dividends, but by its solvency, conserva
tism, and promptness to respond to its
customers' legitimate needs. Its reserves,
in his opinion, should be available for use
in times of emergency, and were not In
tended to be' burled and never touched.
The recent deposits of public moneys and
offers to redeem bonds had not been
made, he went on. with any expectation
of aiding the stock market, but solely to
assure the business jnen of the country
that there should be no money famine
this autumn.
MORE BONDS NECESSARY.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va.. Sept. 25.â The
Bankers' Association of Maryland and the
District of Columbia, which Is holding its
annual convention aboard a steamer in
the Potomac and Chesapeake Bay. to-day
visited the shipyard and other points of
Interest here and later went to Norfolk.
Among the special guests on the steamer
were* Secretary of the Treasury Shaw and
daughter. Comptroller of the Currency
W T llliam H. Ridgely and Ellis H. Roberta,*
Treasurer of the United States.
On the way down from Washington
Thursday night Secretary Shaw made a
speech in which he took a decidedly opti
mistic view of the business prospect3 of
the country.
Let us get a little to the bank vaults and
the pockets of the people. The gold coin and
certificates In circulation September 1, 1S0S,
was $GJirt, 16fi. 1CT). which was 37 per cent of the
total. By the first of the present month this
factor had become $1,014,531,078. or 42 per cent
of the whole. Here- in the gold currency of the
land Is a gain of $.148,364,910 within five years.
This is the strength of our circulating medium
and the crown as well as the corner-stone of
our financial system.
More vital yet Is the growth of the official
treasury of the several countries. In five years
the Bank of France has gained J127.64O.0O0
and the Austro-Hungarlan $79,120,000. In the
same period the Imperial German Bank has
lost $38. CSS. 000. the Bank of England $2,265.
000. and Russia $132,240,000. Good fortune hiis
added to the gold in the Treasury vaults of the
United States from the close cf August. 1898,
to the first day of the current month $"03,980.
29. r >. or very nearly $80,000,000 a year on the
average.
GROWTH OF TREASURY.
This Is not the whole case. These foreign
treasuries are practically the sole basis of the
finances of the respective nations. On the hold-
Ings of the Bank of England rests the credit,
public and private, of the British Empire.
With ua. besides the gold in the national
Treasury, the banks, national and other, own
$322,408,571, and this Is more than any central
institution holds, save those of France and
Russia.
National bank notes constitute less than one
elxth or our stock of money. *4l3.6Â»t'.915 out of
$2. 70S, 093. 003, and no legislation can change
that ratio very materially. Gold, on the other
hand, furnishes #1.2Â«7, 733,a4y, or hard on
one-half of our stock, and it grew nearly $12..
000,000 last month.
Let us be content to stand on the rock bot
tom of gold. Of $2. 33S. 902, 178 money In cir
culation, gold in coin aad certificates In $1,104.
630.078; bank. notes are Just leas than $400,000.
000. And again, look at the Treasury holdings.
The gold there is to-day the largest sum ever
recorded. JÂ«53.0OO,0O0. Our Treasury holds
three and nine-tenths times the amount of gold
belonging to the Bank of England, which Is
$166,826,000; It Is more than three and eight
tenths times that If the Imperial German Bank,
which is $170,371,000. and very nearly three
times that of the Austro-Hungarlan Bank,
which Is 5221.404.000: It lacks only $8,000,000
of being equal to that of both the Banks of
England and of France, which latter holds
$494,508,000. and it exceeds the amount of Rus
sia. Germany. Belgium and the Netherlands
combined.
"WASHINGTON. Sept 23.â Ellis H. Rob
erts, Treasurer of the United States, who
Is attending the Joint convention of the
Maryland and District of Columbia Bank
ers' Association, which is being held on
board a steamboat on the Potomac River,
to-night delivered an address before that
convention, In which he said:
Wheat (Including flout) exports for tha
week ending September 21 aggregata
3.053.4S0 bushels, against 1.903.083 bushels
last week, 5.077,070 this week last year.
4,470,352 in 1902 and 3.242.810 in 1900.
Business failures In the United States
for the week entllng September 25 number
ISO. against 170 last wwk, 172 In the like
week of 1902 and 170 in 190L In Canada
failures for the week number 13. aa com
pared with 19 last week and 13 la thu
week a year ago.
Reports of conservatism and even cau
tion in fall and winter trade testify to
the rbferce of the spur of insistent de
mand which a year ago gave the selling
side such an advantage. The fewness of
car shortage complaints Isevldence alike
of the later movement of crops and of
discrimination in orders by consumers.
The quieting of demand has become more
manifest in iron and steel, where plans
for restriction of furnace output are be
ing discussed and finished products lag,
and in anthracite coal, where a number
of collerles have been put on shorter
time. Building activity at New York has
not been resumed in full, strikes of ves
sel men on the lakes retard shipments,
and advanced freight rates and high
prices for cotton, with lack of correspond
ingly higher prices for finished products,
check full resumption of operations.
Railway earnings returns are still
slightly favorable, those roads reporting
for the first half of September showing
a gam of 10 per cent over a year ago.
Relatively the test reports come fro:n
parts of the Northwest, due to better
weather and crop conditions; the South
west, which has escaped crop injury, and
the South, where^ despite crop delay and
declining cotton prices, the general out
look is still good. Eastern advices are of
fair trade, but quietness in general busi
ness is noted in New York.
Lumber and building materials are not
so active as earlier expected at the East.
Lumber is also rather quieter at tha
West.
Bradstreets to-morrow will say:
Notwithstanding several unsatisfactory
features the volume of tradÂ© continues
large and tho distribution of merchandise
taxes shipping" facilities Announcement
of a concerted effort to restrict produc
tion of pig iron Indicates that supplies
have begun to accumulate. Railroad
earnings continue to show gains. Sep
tember returns thus far exceeding last
year's by 8.7 per cent, and those of 1W1
by 17.2 per cent. Traffic blockades oc
curred to some extent, although the
movement of farm products is still un
seasonably small.
New labor controversies have begun,
but a number of serious troubles have
been averted, and on the whole the num
ber of men idle voluntarily has dimin
ished. Enforced idleness in the iron and
steel Industries is more than offset by the
resumption of spindles at cotton mills and
there Is great activity at footwear fac
tories, although the margin of profit is
narrow. Lower prices for the leading ag
ricultural staples indicate a general be
lief in improved crop prospects. Jobbing
trade Is still making good comparisons
with previous years and. while the zenith
has been passed in fall dry goods. It is
still a satisfactory season. At many Im
portant points the weather has been more
propitious for retail trade and collections
are fairly prompt, considering the tight
ness of the money market.

had but little quotable variance. Fancy Ap

were quickly snapped up by the canners, who
paid $206"5 per ton for Solway freestones and
$30 for clingstones. Cantaloupes were in light
receipt and firmer, with some well known
brands selling fr6m the stores at a slight ad

and Watermelons were In fair request at un

tinued very large, and, although there was
eome Jnqulry for shipment, the market ruled
weak at easy prices. Receipts of Wine Grapes
were light and choice- Zinfandels were quoted
firm. The white variety sold slowly, although
offered at an easy figure. Receipts of Berries
while light, were more than sufficient for re
quirements, and prices were 'lower, with seme
dealers trying to force salep.
There was continued firmness In Oranges
under a fair, inquiry for shipment to Honolulu,
but prices were no hiRher. Mexican Limes
were easy at the recently reduced quotations,

CHICAGO, Sept 25.â At the opening there
was good buying by the local shorts, with some
demand for the long account on strong outside
markets and uteady cables. December was up
Â¦ic to <5ic at "Uvic to 77c and soon advanced to
77>i<\ with a marked bullish sentiment. After
holding steady at the advance for a time the
market gradually eased off on the resumption
of liquidation due to favorable aspects in the
strike situation at Minneapolis and favorable
reports frcm abroad, with lack of outside sup
porting orders. Long wheat came out on stop
orders and tile weakness that developed carried
December to 76Hc before the mood changed
on reports of good export buslnes?. The close
was steady, with the loss entirely regained,
77 l ,4c for December, 1%<31%c above yesterdny!
Corn was firmer at the outset by covering of
the provision people, and showed a substantial
advance over the opening. Cash and commis
sion houses were also good buyers and helped
the upward tendency. Before noon, however
liquidation on the advance brought about a rel
action and the market lost all of the early Im
provement. Uncertainty manifested In the
stock list curtailed Fpeculatlon and the break
In wheat Influenced corn values. December
closed at 40Vic, a gain of %c.
The oats market was fairly steady during
most of the pepslon, but In the last hour weak
ened with other grains. December closed a
shade better at 37%C.
Selling for outside account In sympathy with
lower prices for hogn at the yards gave the
provision list an easier feeling, but the market
was eaved from a marked decline. October
pork closed 5c lower Â¦ and lard and ribs were
off 10c.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Chicago Grain Market.
Butter developed a decided weakness yester
day and several large houses offered their best
creameries at 30c an:! even then found business
very slow. The public are running on the
cheaper Eastern and storage goods, to the

Cheese remains the same, the market being
handicapped by an overstock of medium and
lower grade goods, which are very hard to dis

Eggs show no material change. Stocks of

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
NEW YORK. Sept. 25.â Yesterday's late
over.te in the ttock market aroused serious ay
prehensiens that disastrou? results might be
witnessed to-day. As is orten the case in
sjMK-ulatlve matters, the threatened harm in
cited to efforts to counteract It. There were
etr Â»ng r ruttctive measures adopted In the stock
market to check thÂ« precipitate decline in
I.rici-* which threatened the violent shrinkage
of <re<lttÂ». There were feverish and erratic
fluctuations during the greater part of the
morning, but the l-uppnrting measures finally
proved of effect and the market quieted duwn
and bf-eame t-teady at level cf values substan
tially above last night. There was some Bet
t!Â»-rt:or.t again In the final dealings, but the
jire-sFure was again resitted and the market
i loud steady and dull, but below the best.
Th>- liquidation vif continued with consldera
1 Â¦:â¢â¢ force this morning, especially in the United
Bum Steel securities. Both classfs of stock
Â¦nd the second mortgage bonds optned at n^w
low records and ketit the early market unset
tled in *pitÂ»Â» of support l>y powerful clients at
dh^r r.ijlnus. When the fact developed that

t-'ars m.Ed* a determined drive in an attempt
to regain thÂ«> upper hand. They catered I lie

their ehorts. The principal active stocks after

O. F. Von Rhein Lectures Before
Large Audience in First Pres

A large audience was treated to a rare
entertainment last night when O. F. von
Rheln recounted the experience of a globe
trotter. He spoke at the First Presby
terian Church. In an address that spar
kled with humor and vivid reminiscences
Mr. von Rhein recounted Incidents of his
travels In India, Japan and the Islands
of the East.
The lecturer prefaced his remarks by
some general advice to prospective trav
elers. He said:
"I am asked very many times what is
the cost of foreign travel. I would reply
that $10 a day is the minimum expendi
ture for those who desire to travel in
comfort. Many do the 'grand tour* on
less, but they have to sacrifice much of
their enjoyment by so doing."
Continuing, the speaker gave a vivid
account of life In Calcutta. Madras and
Ceylon, showing the peculiarities of the
Parsees and the Hindoos, and dwelling
upon the magnificence of the courts of thÂ»
Indian rajahs. " Â¦':([-

erable overcrowding in the present build

isted for many children who desired to

The furnishings in the theater were
very handsome and were practically
ruined by the water poured on the burn-
Ing building. The damage to the'build
ing and its contents is estimated to be
very heavy.
The firemen were successful in their
efforts to confine the blaze to the theater
and thus saved thousands of dollars'
worth of rare bric-a-brac and works of
art. During the progress of the fire plate
glass from one of the skylights fell in
and severely cut the hands of Battalion

"Did you pity the pitted son?" ventured
Judge Cabaniss. Mrs. Goodwin playfully
tapped the judicial elbow and laughed a
tinkling laugh at the Judicial pun.
"He asked about our business and I
showed him our smallpox demonstrator
and our chicken-pox demonstrator. Dem
onstrators are not patent fire extinguish
ersâoh, no. Then Jie offered me three
times the salary If I would go into his
business."
"I first saw 'Dr.* Williams when he
came to Mrs. Harris* place and said he
was a barber and had a son who was
pitted."
"He is the husband of Mrs. Margaret
Thatcher, who complains that Mrs. Har
ris did not treat her face successfully.
He came to my house to see about buy
ing some of my second-hand clothes."
"Did he say for whom he wanted the
clothes?" Inquired the attorney.
"Yes, he wanted them for himself."
His Honor had scarcely recovered his
equilibrium when Mrs. Goodwin gurgled
on.
"Yes. I know Dr. Thatcher," replied the
fair one to the query of the attorney for
the defense.
PITIED PITTED BOY.
Â¦ry-^.LAYFUL as a kitten, smiling so

f" 1^ jor and tho minor series of dim
Â¦"L pies, coy In her quaint dermatolog
ical way, Mrs. Alice Goodwin of
the beauty foundry of M. Ella Harris
held the center stage in the roaring farce
comedy which was produced before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday afternoon. To en
large upon her radiant beauty of face
or the delicate charm of her manner
would be to paint the lily.
Mrs. Goodwin had so far torn herself
from the entrancing art of face sculptur
ing as to consent to appear as a witness
in behalf of M. Ella Harris In the suit
for libel being waged by that lady against
her rival non-union practitioner, "Dr."
Leon Williams. The honor of a noble
profession rested upon the shoulders of
Mrs. Goodwin. She and she alone could
vindicate the title held by her employer
of being the only safe and reliable beatity
artist in the city and county of San Fran
cisco.
As soon as the unfortunate man's fate
was discovered the ambulance was rushed

Here the attorney for the defense
pleaded with the Judge that this was not
direct 'testimony. His Honor began to
look grave and chew his mustache when
the fair witness turned upon him the full
effulgence of her soulful eyes and let
loose three extra kinks in her dimples.
"Well â ahemâ a woman must have her
way, you know," faltered the Judge.
"Proceed with your examination, gentle
men; but let me say that the court will
sustain a motion for a change of venue
to the Orpheum at any time now."
When Mrs. Goodwin had reluctantly
relinquished the witness chair, M. Ella
Harris took it to give the court a few
professional pointers. She said that Mrs.
Thatcher, whose testimonial to the skill
of Williams had cast a libelous reflection
upon the work of the Harris studio, had
come to her to have a thorough overhaul
ing of her countenance. There were pim
ples to be amputated, pittings to be re
touched and a few wrinkles to be mas
saged. All this had she. M. Ella Harris,
done with neatness and dispatch and
turned Mrs. Thatcher out upon an awe
struck world to dazzle the eyes of man
with the glory of her face.
Then to prove that a demonstrator was
not a new patent fire extinguisher. Mrs.
Harris put Mrs. Minna Elliot upon the
stand. Mrs. Elliot was a smallpox dem
onstrator. The left hemisphere of her
countenance looked l-Â»:e a ragged piece
of canton flannel, but beyond the meri
dian of her nose there glowed the blush
of a spring peony. Judge Cabaniss had
the great misfortune to sit on the "be
fore using" side and requested the wit
ness to look him in the eye from time to
time as a gentle sedative.
At last the gathering gloom began to
veil the specimens of the beauty doctor's
handicraft and Judge Cabaniss announced
that he was going, to . Napa to take the
rest cure and would not listen to the case
for at least ten days.

"Well, why didn't you?" queried his

"Because, Judge, he was no gentleman.
He Insulted me. He told me I had such

SOME OF THE CHARACTERS WHO FIGURED IN THE INTERESTING
BATTLE OF THE BEAUTY DOCTORS IN JUDGE CABANISS' COURT
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
The quandary is all the greater because
the State raise of 30 per cent must also
be calculated on the valuation. If As
sessor Dodge's valuation is accepted the
United Railroads will be compelled to
pay taxes on $26,093,837 after deducting
moneys and solvent credits. If, however,
the State board's figures are adopted the
amount of taxes to be paid by the rail
road company will be considerably less.
The matter has been placed in thd hands
of the Supervisors' Judiciary Committee
for settlement.
The Board of Supervisors under the
State law is compelled to pass an ordin
ance at next Monday's meeting declaring
the mileage of the railroad corporations,
together with the value thereof for as
sessment purposes. It is therefore con
fronted with the dilemma as to whether
it shall accept the valuation of the State
Board of Equalization or that of the As
sessor.
The Board of Supervisors is at present
struggling with another complication In
the assessment muddle as the result of
the State Board of Equalization fixing the
assessment of the United Railroads la
this city and county. The board named
was given power to assess the corporation
by a Supreme Court decision because the
systen? Is operated in two counties.
The Board of Equalization fixed the val
uation of the system for assessment pur
poses at $18,042,SS5, while Assessor Dodge
assessed the plant at $20,829,208 which in
cludes franchise, solvent credits, money,

IN A QUANDARY
Superintendent J. F. O. Comstock has
occupied his present position for eleven
years and has been connected with the
patrol since its inception. The vigilance
of the patrol is shown In the fact that Su
perintendent Comstock has not enjoyed
a day's vacation since he was placed in
charge.
Under an amended act of the Legisla- j
ture, passed six years ago. It became obli
gatory on all fire insurance companies to
contribute to the support of fire patro : s I
In all cities in the State where such
patrols exist.
The annual cost in this city of maintain
ing the fire patrol amounts to $35,000. The
work of the patrol consists in spreading
rubber and canvas covers at fires and I
saving property from destruction andJ
damage.
All fires are responded to by the vigl- {
lant men of the patrol, whether the scene
of the fire Is insured or not. In the last
year the patrol attended 138 fires and
spread 1217 covers and since its organiza
tion has attended 12,160 fires and spread
S5.871 covers. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars' worth of property are annually
saved by the patrol and its saving to com
merce is very high.
The officers of the Fire Patrol Board
are: William McDonald, president; John
Scott Wilson, vice president; Rudolph
Herold. secretary and treasurer: directors
âGeorge W. Spencer, B. Faymonvllle. V.
Carus Driffield and L. L. Bromv.ell.
The fire patrol Is maintained by the
underwriters, which consist of officers
r>f the fire insurance' companies. It was
Incorporated In 1S75 and went Into effect
under an act of the Legislature of April,
1876.
Exhibitions of "pole sliding" were given
for the benefit of the visitors and sharp at
noon a complete "hitch-up" was a source
of delight to all v.ho witnessed it.
The men of the fire patrol were scat
tered through the building just previous
to the striking of the noon hour gong. In
a twinkling the men of the patrol slid
down the poles from the second and third
stories. The horses jumped from their
stalls to their positions beneath the hang
ing harness, hooks were clamped and
everything was ready for a "turn .out."
"Three seconds," cried Mayor Schmitz
and Chief of Police Wittman, who held
stop watches, and the crowd of visitors
cheered at the quick time in which the
men and apparatus got ready.
A luncheon was served by the under
writers to their guests and short speeches
were made by Mayor Sch:n!tz. Chief of
Police Wittman, William McDonald,
president of the Board of Underwriters;
Superintendent J. F. O. Comstock and
other officials.
The Underwriters' Fire Patrol now has
three stations in this city â No. 1 at 14 Na
toma street. No. 2 at 65 City Hall avenue
and No. 3 at 1915 Bush street.
The invitations to the opening of the
new station were generally accepted and
the guests of the underwriters were lav
ish in their praise of the building and Its
equipment.
The top story of the brick building is
used as a storeroom and the attic roof is
equipped for washing and drying the rub
ber and canvas sheets ustd In the work
of the fire patrol.
The former quarters on Jessie street
having been required for building: pur
poses by the owners, the board of direc
tors of the fire patrol was obiliged to seek
a new location.
The commodious station is located at 14
Natoraa street and was built expressly 1 to
accommodate the requirements of the
fire patrol. On the ground floor are
housed the wagons, buggies, pumping en
gine and horses of the station. The floor
above is devoted to sleeping apartments
of the men who are attached to the sta
tion, officers' quarters and recreation
rooms.
The new station, Xo. 1, of the Under
writers' Fire Patrol, was formally opened
yesterday in the presence of a laxse gath
ering of city officials and gentlemen inter
ested in fire insurance business.
No move was made last night to serve
more warrants, but it is thought that to
day may witness the arrest of several
other white men who b&ve aided in the
unlawful substitution of Chinamen. It
Â¦was learned on good authority that evi
dence has been secured to warrant the
indictment of six more Caucasians for
this illegal traffic.
Wong Tin acknowledged that he had
been engaged in securing the substitution
of Chinamen since January last. He told
of several specific cases, in one of which
live Chinamen who were ordered deported
were 6et at liberty and Jive decrepit Chi
namen substituted in their places for re
f.rn to their native country. He said
that he paid $1000 for this and that this
money did not go to Dasha. To whom it
was paid the officials would not state last
night. Tin claimed that all he was paid
fi.- the part he took in the substitution
was $15 to $20 a head.
After the statement of the Chinaman
was reduced to writing and read to him
he verified Its correctness and was then
tak^n back to the City Prison for the
night.
It is possible that no st?ps toward secur
ing the custody of the suspected men will
be taken before the Federal Grand Jliry
-eports. which may not b-? until next Fri
day. The body was in cession yesteruay,
but did not consider the substitution
casee, as there was little new evidence
to offer. With Tins confession there is
now plenty of material for action an>1 at
its meeting on Tuesday the Grand Jury
will probably take up the substitution
cases again.
From 6 o'clock until 10 they took turns
at pumping the Chinaman and as a result
they claim to have secured positive evi
dence of the culpability of more v.hite
men in the substitution plot, who have all
along been suspected by the authorities.
Who these are the officials refuse to state,
but it is learned that another watch of
three men at the County Jail, besides the
three men already under bonds, have been
involved by the confession of the China
man.
From beneath a narrow bunk at 12 Fire
alley in Chinatown Detective Tim Cole
man yesterday afternoon dragged Wong
Tin. the much-sought accomplice of Horn
Toon in the Chinese substitution cases In
the starch with Coleman were Detective
Ed Gibson, wise in the ways of China
town from long experience, and Harry
Moffitt. UniteJ States secret service
agent. They had a long hunt for the wily
Celestial. Although they had positive in
formation that Won Tin was on the prem
ises they searched for nearly an hour be
fore they found him. crammed into a
space so narrow that it seemed almos-. im
possible for him to get in there.
He was hurrird to the Hall of Justice
and Special Secret Service Agent Burns
talked with him for a short time with the
aid of Dr. Gardiner as interpreter. The
Chinaman seemed willing to divulge what
he knew of the substitution matter and
it was linally decided to take him to
Burns' room at the Russ House and sub
mit him to a thorough sweating. He was
handcuffed and escorted to the hot^l by
Vnited States Marshal Shine. Secret Ser
vice Agents Burns and Mofntt. United
States District Attorney Woodworth and
his assistant, Ben McKinley; Chinese In
epectors Median ar.d Gardner and a few
other Federal officials. They were taking
no chances on an escape.

NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC.
A New Law for the State of California
After many years of the most successful
practice MR. GEORGE MATERLE. the Ger-
man Expert Optician at 1071 Market street,
has been awarded a certificate by the State of
California entitlinj; him to practice Optometry
and prescribe glasses to those having weak
eyes and poor sight.
MR. GEORGE MATERLE has probably fit-
ted glasses to more prominent men of thÂ«
world than any other optician ln this country.
The fact that the hiphest U. S. Army. Navy
and Government officials are using his glassy
should be sufficient evidence of his wonderful
ability to treat most complicated cases with
accuracy and perfection.
