OYSTER BAY, L. I., Aug. 28.â President Roosevelt was informed to-night of
the Incorrectness of the. report that United States' Vice Consul Magels
sen, at Beirut, Syria, had been assassinated. Â¦ The ; -President expressed
gratification that Consul Magelssen had escaped' without injury from the"
assault of. the. would-be murderer. â¢ Â¦ l â¢ '
He announced, however, that no change at present would be madeTin the
plans of this Government, and that the European squadron, which he, last night
ordered to proceed immediately to Beirut, "would 'go', to; its, ordered "destina

visable, in view of the present state of unrest in Turkey, to have American
.war vessels in Turkish waters. : ...â¢,.-. .... .. *. V->Vr\
CONSTANTINOPLE, Aug. 28.â It transpires that the report that
Vice Consul Magelssen was killed is incorrect. An unknown indi
vidual fixed at him, and the bullet passed close to the Vice Con
sul, but did not touch him.
The Vali of Beirut visited Vice Consul Magelssen, expressing his
regrets for the outrage, and ordered measures for the arrest of the per
son who fired the shot. The error in stating that .Vice Consul. Megelssen
had been killed arose from a mistake In a cipher telegram. ' ; <
WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.â The State Department '. to-night re
ceived a cablegram from Minister Leishman at Constantinople confirm
ing the dispatch announcing that the' report that Consul Megelssen had
been assassinated was incorrect. The Minister says the mistake made
by him in announcing the assassination was due- to an error in the
transmission of the cipher dispatch from Consul Ravendal at Beirut. .

One alternative is that the* President
shall act In accordance with' the provis
ions of the Spooner law, and, having
failed to make a treaty of a satisfactory
kind with Colombia, turn to Nicaragua
route and build the canal via Greytown
and Lake Nicaragua.
A second course is to delay this great
work until something transpires to maite
Colombia* see the light and then negotiate
for another treaty. This course might
be followed If the treaty should come
back without many important amend
ments.
The United States long ago informed
the little republic that if amendments
were made to the treaty they would not
be acceptable to this Government. It is
impossible for this Government to recede
from this statement and to consider the
talk of negotiating a new treaty which
would give Colombia greater advantages
and an annuity of $500,000 instead of $250,
000, which some of the Colombians de
mand. This demand is termed blackmail.
The conference of the President and Sec
ertary Hay was to map out a plan to be
pursued in view of the admitted failure
of treaty. There are several alternatives
for the administration, and none will be
taken until after full consultation with
leaders in Congress.
President Roosevelt and Secretary Hay
regard the treaty as probably dead. They
take little interest in dispatches from
Minister Beaupre at Bogota, which pur
port to detail efforts being made by Co
lombians to "save the treaty" by amend
inc it.
OYSTER BAT. Aug. 28.â Public senti

what action the United States shall take

reason why Secretary of State Hay came
here to Bee the President to-day. As the
matter may be considered at the extra
session of Congress, Hay's visit was ar
ranged several days ago, while it yet
seemed Impossible for the United States
to become involved even indirectly In the
affairs of Turkey and her. rÂ«>b~nious prov
inces.

Without hurrying, but seemingly with
the utmost coolness, the highwayman pro
ceeded to search his victims. From the
motorman he took a watch and 70 cents.
The conductor yielded up $21, his watch,
a revolver and papers. The passengers
were next searched, the robber making no
effort to 6earch the pockets of the women,
but contenting himself with taking their
purses. Miss Daisy Gulnn, 4303 Horticul

The Secretary arrived here from his summer home in New Hampshire at
12:20 p. m. In a driving rainstorm he was conveyed to the President's home in
time for luncheon. During the greater part of the afternoon he was In confer
ence with the President. He left Sagamore Hill about 4:30 o'clock. He took
the 5 o'clock train for New York and will go thence to Washington to-night
At 11 o'clock to-night a telegram was received by Secretary Loeb from Act
ing Secretary of State Loomis at Washington, communicating the text of a ca
blegram from Minister Leishmann at Constantinople, confirming the report of
the inaccuracy of the story of Consul Magelesen's assassination. As soon as
the message was deciphered Secretary Loeb communicated its contents to the
President by telephone, i Mr. Leishmann explains that the error occurred in
deciphering a. telegram received from Consul Ravndahl, at Beirut, concerning the
attempt upon the life of Vice Consul Magelssen. The text of Minister Lelsh
mann's cablegram Is not made public here.
It can be said to be the purpose of President Roosevelt to afford American
citizens in the disturbed province of Turkey all the protection possible. For
that reason, and others that may develop In a short time, the decision is
reached that no change will be made at this time in the orders to the European
squadron. Admiral Cotton will proceed with his vessels to Turkish waters with
the idea of safeguarding American Interests.
- The fact that- Secretary Hay considers his presence in Washington neces
sary at this time indicates the serious view he takes of the Turkish situation. He
had not expected to return to Washington for several weeks, but the, develop
ments in the Ottoman empire during the past few days induced. him .to come to
Oyster Bay for a conference with the President, after which it was deemed ad
visable by both that he should return to Washington at least for a couple
of weeks.
For several hours to-day President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hay were
in conference at Sagamore Hill. They discussed every suggested phase of the
situation in Turkey. At the conclusion of the conference Secretary Hay an
nounced his intention of returning Immediately to Washington.

Acting Secretary of the Navy Darling to-night received a cablegram from
the admiral dated Villefranche, saying that he had left that place with the
cruisers Brooklyn and San Francisco for Genoa, on the way to Beirut.
The latest development in the Turkish situation . was discussed in official
circles, where the view was held that the denial of the report of the killing
of Mr. Magelssen relieved the situation of its Immediate awkward and em
barrassing features, but will not prevent our naval vessels continuing to the
East. Minister. Leishmann, in one of his dispatches to the department, sug
gested that conditions were such that it might be well to have some American
naval demonstration in those waters. Reports also have come to the Govern
ment from the mlsBionary Interests of threatened destruction of their property
at Harpoot, and because of this Admiral Cotton .will be allowed to proceed with
his vessels to Beirut. >YV â¢
The dispatch from the Minister was communicated at - once to President
Roosevelt at Oyster Bay. Its contents were extremely gratifying to the officials
of the Gvernment, as it relieved the situation of its extreme tension and leaves
the way open for an amicable and peaceful adjustment of the Incident. Acting
Secretary of State LoomiB declined to make public the text of Minister Lelsh
mann's dispatch to-night, but he gave a summary of ita contents. As stated
in the press dispatches it showed that Mr. Magelssen had been shot at by some
person at the time unknown to the officials, but that he had not been hit.
Local Turkish official* w^re prompt to express their regret at the occur
rence and were exerting themselves to apprehend the assassin, but thus far
had been unsuccessful. The Minister's dispatch also said -that Consul Ravn
dahl had reported to him that some of the foreign Consuls located at Beirut had
reported to their governments â¢ that the Bltuatlon at that placo had become ex
ceedingly unsafe; that this condition of affairs had existed for some time and
that something ought to be done to relieve the tension. The S opinion was ex
pressed that the attemDted assassination of Magelssen probably would bring
matters to a "focus, the attention of the Turkish Government being drawn to
the matter in this forclbl* way and some effort would be made to avoid further
trouble. t
This information came to the State Department to-night in a dispatch from
United States Minister Leishmann at Constantinople, who said the mistako In
making the original announcement was due to an error' in the transmission
of the cipher dispatch from Consul Ravndahl at Beirut in reporting the Incident
to the Minister.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.â A decidedly new turn in the case of United States
Vice Consul William C. Magelssen, at Beirut, Syria, who was reported to have
been assassinated last Sunday, developed to-night when it became known that
the report was incorrect and that, although Mr. Magelssen had been shot at,
he had not even been . injured.

The members of No. 6 engine also per
formed heroic work. Five men rushed
',:Â«eir hose through the burning building
occupied by Markley & Winner, at 551
Brannan street, and battled with the
flames. On every side of the men charred
timbers were falling. Over their heads
ihi flooring, was burning fiercely. Spec
tators marveled at their courage and
wondered how long they could stay with
out being injured. The brave fellows
r.ever le f t their posts. They kept a wary
lookout .or falling walls and Chief Sulli
van did likewise. He was mindful of the
danger of his men and also saw the ad
vantage they had in keeping the flames
from spreading to the Herring Planing
MilL
During the progress of the fire mem
bers cf No. 8 truck climbed the shed over
the planing mill owned by Voigt & Veyhle
at 541 Brannan street and fought the fire.
They wore unmindful of trie fact that
the building beneath them was burning.
They stayed at their pest amid the ter
rific heat and the only relief they re
ceived was from the spray that spread
from their hose. T..eir clothes steamed
v.lth heat end their faces were scorched
but the- remained until the chief called
them oft.
The heit from the fire was so great
that! the glasses In the buildings on the
Jicrth s'.de of Brannan street were broken
and the paint blistered. It was feared
that the parochial house of St. Rose's
parish and the church itself was in dan
ger of destruction and the pastor and his
assistants were ready to move valuables
to a place of safety. However, the fire
men prevented the fire from crossing the
street. 1 lere was a wind blowing, but
It blew to the south. The condition of
the wind aided the department materially
in subduing the flames.
HEAT WAS TERRIFIC
Chief Sullivan was early on the scene
and directed the energies of his men to
saving surrounding property. In this he
was eminently successful. He succeeded
in keeping the fire penned between Rich
ard Herring's mill at 569 Brannan street
and the Progressive Planing Mill Com
pany at 523 Brannan street, both of which
were saved.
The engines worked in tandem and
pumped powerful streams of water
through the long lines of hose that tilled
the streets. One battery was stationed in
front of the burning structures and the
other in the rear. The batteries did won
derful execution. As many as six hose
were attached and the force of water that
â¢Ras sent through the giants was sufficient
to batter dÂ«iwn walls.
vrhen the alarm came In for box 6S the
lire was burning fiercely in George
Braendlein's furniture manufacturing
plant at 547 Brannan street. Emil Coret,
a Morse patrolman, discovered the blaze
and immediately turned in the alarm. As
soon rs the District Chief arrived he saw
the magnitude of the fire and turned'in
a combination alarm from the same box.
This alarm was the third and fourth and
called ourt nineteen engines, five trucks,
t-.-o chemicals, the water tower and two
batteries.
FIRE IS DISCOVERED.
Chief Sullivan and h!s brave ftrÂ«nen
proved themselves heroes at'the big con
flagration on Brannan street, between
Fourth and Fifth, last night. They bat
tled -the flames from all sides, and despite
the fact that inflammable material fed
the fire, succeeded in extinguishing it
within two hours after the first alarm
came in. From a spectacular point of
view the fire was well worth seeing,
names leaped high in air and the sky
v is Ut up for blocks xrith a rpd glow
wnich attested the fierceness of the flre.
Thousands of people rushed to the scene,
but were held in check by the police and
tfr, firemen had a splendid chance to
prove the efficiency of the department.
Beneath burning roefs the men stood at
their post of duty playing heavy -streams
on the -ipidly spreading Dames. In the
terrific i.eat the firemen fought the fire
and theiv efforts were successful. During

Another ungent appeal has reached the
State Department from the American
Board of Missions at Boston that ade
quate steps be taken for the protection
of American citizens at Beirut. The
board's dispatches from there Jor several
days have represented the situation as
extremely grave. There are at the Eu
phrates College at Marpoot four American
teachers, besides women and children,
and property to the value of $100,000. There
is an American college at Beirut in which
are a number of American teachers. No
word has reached the State Department
regarding any attack on them.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 28.â Minister
Leishman has cabled the State Depart
ment that he called at the Foreign Of
fice again last night and presented the
American demand for an immediate in
vestigation of the attempted assassina
tion of Vice Consul Magelssen at Beirut.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, while
denying all knowledge of the affair and
attempting to discredit the report, on
the insistence of Mr. Leishman prom
ised that a.n immediate investigation
would follow and that the Turkish Gov
ernment would take immediate steps to
find out and punish the guilty.
Mr. Leishman stated that Macedonian
conditions are growing constantly more
acute, and that the situation in that
section is extremely grave.
In his cablegram to Mr. Leishman last
night regarding the report of the Amer
ican Board of Missions that an attempt
had been made to burn the Euphrates
College building at Harpoot. Acting Sec
retary Loomis instructed him to demand
of the Turkish Government that it take
immediate steps for the protection of
the lives of all Americans there.
TURKEY TO INVESTIGATE.
Demands Made by the American
Minister Are He%ded.
It is pointed out that the United States
is independent of European agreements
regarding Turkey and . that -no matter
what policy she may adopt in regard to
the attempted assassination of Magelsscn
or the unrest at Karput. it will not be in
tervention in the international affairs of
Turkey.
The officials of the Turki3h embassy say
the Sultan will undouotedly institute an
immediate investigation if he has not al
ready done so. The embassy deprecates
the dispatch of an Amertcan squadron to
Turkish waters as tending to encourage
the revolutionists, who. the embassy de
clares, have been eagerly seeking for some
time to embroil the Turkish and American
governments.
LONDON*, Aug. 2S.-The Foreign Of
fice has received a dispatch from the
British Consul at Beirut notifying
the authorities of the attempted as
sassination of William C. Magelssen,
the United States Vice Consul at that
place. No details are given, and this to
gether with the fact that there have been
no developments since the attempted as
sassination was reported lead the British
officials to conclude that no anti-foreign
uprising has occurred.
The Foreign Office declares that Great
Britain will certainly not and that It is

SpÂ«cial Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
BOURNE, Mass., A us. 23.â Grover
Cleveland made merry with the members
and guests of the Old Colony Club at
a dam bake on Marshalls Island to-day.
The feature of the day wa3 a short hu
morous address he made. Cleveland said
in part:
"I rise, full of clams, hot corn and en
thusiasm for the welfare of the Old Col
ony Club and seal for its interests.
"Within the past few years I have been
widely Jeered and derided for spending
so much of my time at fishing. For those
who dtrido me" I have only auiet con
tempt. I go fishing because I like it. I
should like to say right here that I" am
more interested in the protection of fish
ing at Buzzards Bay than about our
hoary headed infant industries. I care
more for these fishing interests than I
do about the policy of the next Federal
administration.
"Perhaps some of you are aware that
an Interesting event has recently taken
place in our domestic circle. Although
this happy event was not the occasion
for telling any unusual yarns, I put my
fish scale*," Intp requisition and weighed
my latest catch honestly, and the tally
was an even nine pounds."

BERLIN, Aug. 28â Emperor William
met Hans Feichner. the court portrait
painter, some days ago and asked him to
make a lithograph drawing o? President
Roosevelt, Felchner's. lithograph of the
Emperor having been most widely circu

PARIS. Aug. 28.â It is officially stated
here that if an American squadron
should go to Turkish waters the ac
tion of the United States will not be
regarded by France or the other
European powers a3 having any po
litical significance In regard to the near
Eastern situation. It is pointed out that
the United States has always refrained
from taking part In the near Eastern
troubles, th'e European powers assuming
the burden of that situation. An official
here likened the presence of an American
squadron in Turkish waters to the de
mand made by j the British and German
warships in Venezuelan waters, the pur
pose in each case being to command re
spect and enforce the collection of de
mands not having any connection with
the general political conditions.
The latest official advices received here
show that the Russian squadron, which
was at Inlada, off the east coast of Tur
key, was withdrawn to Sebastopol, where
it is awaiting further orders. Italy ha3
one warship, Austria pne and France one
in Turkish waters, but in each case large
squadrons are held in reserve for action
if the situation shall become acute.
The increasing gravity of the conditions
In Turkey is further shown by an official
report Just received from Philippopolis
giving details of the revolutionary plot
to blow up the Oriental express. One
of the plotters had been designated to
sacrifice his life by boarding the train
and throwing the bombs. This plot prob
ably was connected with the dynamiting
of the omnibus train at Kuleli Burgar,
but the Philippopolis report establishes the
fact that the original plan was aimed
against the leading trans-European ex
press for the purpose of impressing the
world with the magnitude of the disorder.
The reports received here from the
French Consuls at Salonica and Monastir
are still more reassuring. They say they
have no further fear for their lives unless
the Turkish soldiery become more lawless.
The reports add that forty-nine Turkish
battalions have been withdrawn from Al
bania and concentrated around Salonica,
as the Albanian disorders have been
crushed. The most remarkable feature of
the reports discloses the fact that the
Turkish force, which totaled 50.C00 men
when the troops entered Albania six
months ago, has been reduced to 35,000
men. Few of the soldiers died of disease.
The loss was chiefly in men killed while
crushing the Albanian uprising.

pc)UU For Women
WHO CAKMOT BE CURED.
So cnifonnly successful has Dr. Pierce'*
Favorite Prescription _proven in all forms
of Female Weakness, Prolapsus, or Falling
of Wotnb, and Lcucorrhea, that, after over
a third of a century's experience in curing
the worst cases of these distressing and
debilitating ailments, Dr. Pierce now feels
fully warranted in offering to pay $500 in
cash for any case of these diseases which
he cannot care.
It Stands Alone.â The "Favorite Pre-
scription" stands alone, as the one and
only remedy for these distressingly com-
mon forms of weakness^ possessed of such
positively specific curative properties as to
warrant its makers in proposing, and
binding themselves to forfeit, as we, the
undersigned proprietors of that wonderful
remedy hereby do, to pay the sum of $500
in legal money of tie United States in any
case of the above diseases in which after a
fair and reasonable trial of our treatment,
we fail to cure. No other medicine for
the cure of woman's peculiar ailments is
backed by such a remarkable guarantee ;
no other medicine for woman's ills is pos-
sessed of the unparalleled curative prop-
erties that would warrant its manufacturers
in making euch an offer ; no other remedy
has such a record of cures on which to base
such a remarkable offer.
Therefore, insist on having Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription and turn your back
on any unscrupulous dealer who would
insult your intelligence by attempting to
foist upon yon some inferior substitute,
under the plea that "it is just as rood."
Insist on having- the article which has a
record of a thira of a century of cures and
which is backed by those willing to forfeit
$500 if they cannot cure you.
In cases attended by a leucorrheal drain
a solution of Dr. Pierce's Lotion Tablets
should be used conjointly with the use of

AIESHIP HOUSEBOAT
ADRIFT IN A STORM
After a long cross-examination by Chief of Police Wittman yesterday morn-
Ing the women. were allowed to go to the funeral of Martin Bowers. They were
accompanied by Detective Braig. Both Mrs. Sutton and Mrs. Martin Bowers
were In tears all day long. Neither would -remove her eyes from the ground.
The "sweating" wore on them considerably. In the evening they were given -a
severe examination by the uistrict Attorney. Peterson again appeared in an
swer to a summons and repeated his story. Mrs. Sutton was again positively
O'Leary is an ignorant laborer. He knows nothing of the accomplishments
of reading or writing. He could not tell the number of the 'house In which he
lived. When questioned regarding his knowledge of the case under investiga
tion he said: "I do not think Mrs. Bowers poisoned her husband. It is untrue
that he hit me over the head with a chair. I was at the house when he came
from Mare Island that night and was introduced to him. I visited him several
times later while he was sick. I never heard that Mrs. Bowers wanted to get
rld^of him. I got acquainted with her about seven months ago. I was coming
up the street and she said, 'Hullo, Mr. O'Leary.' I talked to her then and we
had a ' few drinks in a saloon. I saw her a number Â¦ of times after that.
I know nothing of any, wrongdoing and want to get out."
piece of his own. He had had It for several weeks.
The watch was taken to Mrs. Martin Bowers and she said that It was hers.
She gave it to O'Leary to keep partly because it was not worth anything, partly
because it did not keep time and partly because she did not like to leave It In
the house. The lid to the case showed that something had been pasted inside
and then torn out When asked what this had been she replied that it was
her husband's picture. The police officials believe that this indicates that the
relations between the suspected woman and O'Leary were closer than either
would like to have known tn the present emergency.
An interesting feature of the case is the conflict of testimony in ngard to the
ownership of a lady's gold watch. It was found on O'Leary at the time of fils
arrest. He said that he had bought it of a Jeweler in a store somewhere south
of Market street. He bought It because it was cheap, although he had a time-
Dr. McLaughlin. when informed of the state of affairs, said: "My signature
to that proscription calling for an ounce of arsenic Is a forgery. I never pre
scribed arsenic for Bowers, but did give him some strychnine at various times.
I thought that he was probably suffering from ptomaine poisoning and treated
him accordingly. It might have been arsenic, but how could one suspect that? I
observed that the patient never vomited after coming to the Waldeck Sanatorium
and that he commenced it again when he returned to Clementina street I did
not think Mrs. Bowers was feeding him according to directions. I do not sign my
name 'McLaughlin, M. D.' I have no idea who could have forged my signa
ture." '% .
Statements Regarding Watch Are Conflicting.
"When I secured medicine it was some black stuff in a small bottle. I do
not know the name of it. I gave It to some of them at the house and they ad
ministered it to Mr. Bowers. I ma<lo some other purchases of articles for myself
or my sister at times. I always went to the drus store on the corner of Fifth and
Folsom streets. I will not say whom I suspect of poisoning Mr. Bowers. I am in
nocent of all wrong. I Mmply visited my sister and her sick husband and did
what I could to help them. It is surely not true that I bought the arsenic."
Mrs. Martin Bowers was confronted with a statement from Dr. McLaughlin
that his signature to the prescription was forged. Then she was asked to write
"arsenic" and "McLaughlin, M. D." This she did. She was informed that the
similarity between her own handwriting and that of the forged document was
great After some further questioning she made the following statement:
"I am innocent. I know nothing of any arsenic. I did not write that pre
scription. I loved my husband and would not do anything to Injure him. I gave
him his medicine according to the doctor's orders. There is nothing between me
and that slob O'Leary. I had drinks with him a few times, but that was all. I
never Intended to elope with him. That is all a falsehood. I drew the money
from the bank because I thought Harry Bowers or his wife might try to make
trouble for me on account of it. I did everything I could to muke my husband
comfortable while he was sick. If any person bought poison and gave it to Mr.
Bowers I know nothing of It."'
The paper on which the prescription Is written is evidently a leaf torn from
a blank book and does not contain the physician's letter head, as do all his
other prescriptions. The handwriting, even to the unpractlced eye, resembles
that of Mrs. Martin Bowers very closely. The drug clerk tells a, straightfor
ward story and his statements are given full credence by the police officials.
Mrs. Sutton when- told face to face by Peterson that she presented the fate
ful piece of paper calling for the arsenic replied, "You are mistaken; it was
some one else." In reference to the charge she said:
"I never bought any arsenic in my life. I do not know even what it looks
like. Mr. Peterson is mistaken. I visited the store on several days before
August 13 and once since then, but not on that date. I went to see Mr. Bow
ers nearly every day while he was sick, but never gave him any medicine. My
sister or Harry Bowers or his wife always attended the sick man. I cooked
supper for them nearly every day, as I always went there in the afternoon.
Refuses to Tell Name of Person She Suspects.
Early yesterday morning he accompanied the detective to the Hall of Justice,
where Mrs. Sutton had been taken previously. He was shown Mrs. Harry
Bowers and was asked If she was the woman who bought the arsenic. He said
she was not. Then Mrs. Sutton was brought into the room and he exclaimed
at once, "That is the woman." When asked if it might not be possible that Mrs.
Martin Bowers was the woman he replied" that he was sure already, but that
he would see her if they wished. When the last named woman appeared, he
said, "Oh, no, she is certainly not the person to whom I sold the arsenic"
He was then requested to make a statement, which was as follows:
"I remember distinctly to have sold the arsenic to a woman whom I now
know to be Mrs. Sutton. It was a trifle more than a week ago. She came
into the store and presented a prescription to which Dr. McLaughlln's name
was attached, calling for an ounce of the poison. I had filled .several of the
physician's prescriptions at other times, but did not compare the signatures.
Mrs. Sutton said that she wanted to get the arsenic to give to the doctor. He
intended, she asserted, to use it externally for a sore. She bought some ab
sorbent cotton and a few other articles at the same time and paid 93 cents fcr
the whole purchase. I saw her at the store several times before and knew her
face. There is no mistake. I am positive that she is the woman who bought
the ounce of arsenic. I know how serious a thing it is to say, but here I am
and what could I do but tell the truth? I cautioned Mrs. Sutton about the use of
the poiscn, but she eaid she would not handle It. I remembered her Immedi
ately when I saw her. this morning." j
Mrs. Z. C. Sutton Is Positively Identified.
Mrs. Bowers and Mrs. Sutton were given two rigorous "sweatings" yester
day, but denied ever having seen the arsenic in question. Attorney Frank
Drury has been retained by the two imprisoned women as counsel and they
are preparing to make a determined battle against prosecution by the officers
of the Jaw. Patrick O'Leary still maintains that he Is innocent of all wrong
doing. Mrs. Bowers stated to the police Thursday night that she had patronized
only the Owl drug store and the one at the corner of Fifth and Folsom streets.
Detective Ryan went at once to the last named establishment and asked if any
prescriptions calling for arsenic had been filled there recently. Clerk J. C. Pe
terson found one signed by Dr. McLaughlin, which had been filled on the morn
ing of August 19, six days previous to the death of Bowers.
DRUG CLERK J. C. PETERSON, according to the evidence discovered by the
police authorities, sold to Mrs. Z. C. Sutton the arsenic which brought death
to Martin L. Bowers. The poison was secured on a prescription to which the
name of Dr. McLaughlin was forged. The person who wrote the prescription
Is declared to be Mrs. Martin Bowers, who is suspected 1 of murdering the
bridge builder. The motive for thesuppoEed crime is thought to be the desire
of Mrs. Bowers to run away with Patrick O'Leary. The chain of evidence against
the suspected woman is growing stronger every hour. It Is expected that she or
her sister will break down at almost any moment and make a complete confession.
Shortly after midnight of Thursday the prescription calling for an ounce of
arsenic was discovered in the drug store of J. Askenasy at the corner of Fifth
and Folsom streets. Yesterday morning J. C. Peterson, who sold the poison,
positively identified Mrs. Sutton as the purchaser and she was immediately taken
Into custody by the police. Last night detectives found Dr. McLaunhlln at
Petaluma, where he went Wednesday for a short vacation, and he pronounced
the signature on the prescription a rank forgery. Handwriting Expert Kytka
stated, after a microscopical examination of* the chirography of Mis. Martin
Bowers, that she had signed the physician's name to the paper which called
for the arsenic.

Alone From.Galveston,
Texas.
In the detention room of the City Hall
Police Station, a lad of ten summers,
who has wandered all the way. from-'Gal
veston, Tex., watches and waits for the
time when he will be free and able to re
turn once more to the existence he loves
so well. His name is James Erskine and
he can relate tales of his travels that
would fill a small volume.
The lad arrived in this city last Wednes
day afternoon, according to his own story.
He journeyed about town till he reached
the Mission district, and being tired and
weary, he sat down on a Guerrero-street
doorstep and fell asleep. He was found
later by Patrolman O'Connor and taken
to the City Hall station, where he will
be kept till a home is found for him.
The lad is a native of Galveston, and
he left there several' weeks ago, beating
his way, to this city on freight trains.
His father was killed when he was a mere
infant and his mother met her death in
the terrible Galveston flood three years
ago.
Ever since his mother's death the boy
lived with an aunt. . He. became tired of
home and. resolved to come to California.
He says hie had a pleasant trip and adds
that he wants to be released and go to
work and earn his own living. v He Is a
bright little chap and is a remarkably
good talkef for one of his age.
WANDERING ORPHAN BOY* !
, ARRIVES IN THIS CITY
The authorities have investigated the matter of the bank account and find
that Mrs. Martin Bowers could not have been Influenced to murder her hus
band for that reason. All the while that he was at Mare Island he sent down
a certain sum weekly, which was deposited in the Hibernia Savings Bank. Mrs.
Bowers deposited the money and could have drawn it at any time. When she
withdrew the S'JSOO and placed it in the German Savings Bank she left her pass
book at the latter institution. The police .think that she feared arrest and
wanted to cet the money where it could not be touched. It is thought that
she cared much more for the ignorant O'Leary than she cares to have known.
Her husband was jealous of her. and his death might have cleared the way for
a fourth marriage, this time with O'Leary.
Professor Morgan, who, under the direction of City Chemist Green, i3 exam
ining the internal organs of the dead man, stated yesterday that the quantitative
analysis would not be completed for two or three days yet. Arsenic in large
quantities was present in Bowers' stomach. The arsenic was in the form of
white powder. No charge will be placed against the names of any of those de
tained for several days yet. Chief Wittman says more evidence is forthcoming.
Dr. Draper, attending physician at the German Hospital, made the ' following
statement in regard to the Bowers case yesterday:
"When the patient was brought in he was in a dying condition. I immediate
ly applied the usual restoratives and did everything to keep him alive. I was,
not positive to his ailment, ns I made no examination myself, as the man was too
far gone. At the time of his death I refused to sign the death certificate, as I
had not treated the patient for any sickness myself and was therefore obliged
to notify the Coroner. I explained this to Mrs. Bowers. The patient was in the
building only a few hours before he died."
The funeral of Mr. Bowers was held yesterday under the auspices of
Alta Lodge No. 203, Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Those that attended the
funeral were Mrs. Martin Bowers, Â¦ Mr. and Mrs. Harry Bowers and, brother
members of the lodge. The usual funeral services were conducted at the Odd
Fellows* Hall and the remains were removed to Mount Olivet Cemetery, where
they were interred.

identified' as the purchaser of the arsenic. Both women maintained their stand
of the morning and did not vary to any considerable extent from their previous
statements.
John Cunningham, a waiter in the Oberon, was also examined last night. He
had been a frequent visitor at the Clementina-street house. He denied all
knowledge of any ill-feeling between Martin Bowers and his wife. Hfi was al
lowed to depart on the "understanding that he would be on hand If wanted.

Death of a Former legislator.
STOCKTON*. Aug. 23.â W. R. Leadbet
ter, a pioneer resident of this city, who
was identified with the city's progress for
years, being City Superintendent of
Schools, and holding other positions of
trust, died this morning at the age of 65
years. A widow and two married daugh
ters survive him. He represented this dis
trict in the Legislature in 1SS0. and was
formerly a member of the Maine Legisla
ture.
IN an interview at Petaluma yesterday
Dr. McLaughlin Inferred that he, did
not care to be mixed up in the Bowers
case, although he willingly reviewed
the events which transpired previous
to the death of the bridge builder.
While Dr. McLaughlin would j not say
that Bowers died from arsenical poison
ing, he thought all of the conditions
strange, to say the least. When Dr. Mc-
Laughlin first took charge of the case
Bowers, according to the statement of his
wife, had been suffering for three wteks
from the effects of having partaken of
pork, she also having been a sufferer.
The symptoms were diarrhea, vomiting
and emaciation. The physician refused to
handle the patient unless he was removed
to the Waldeck Sanatorium and Drs. Von
Tietjen and Dillon had been reimbursed
for their services. Bowers had been at
the sanatorium only one day when Dr.
McLaughlin was successful in stopping
the spells of vomiting. Later the diarrhea
gave way to treatment and on a die: of
peptonized milk the sick man appeared on
the road to recovery.
Dr. McLaughlln's treatment had been
the regular one employed in cases of
ptomaine poisoning, although Bowers had
all the symptoms of a person suffering
from lead poisoning, and this was puz
zling. In fact, it was such an interesting
and unusual feature that Dr. McLaughlin
invited Dr. O'Brien of Petaluma to have
a look at the patient, and this latter phy
sician corroborated yesterday the state
ment of Dr. McLaughlin. After being at
the sanatorium nearly four weeks. Dr.
McLaughlin thought Bowers well enough
to be taken home and so told his wife, es
pecially as she. complained of being too
poor to keep her husband at such an es
tablishment, f
Strangely enough, the very day that
Bowers was removed to his Clementina
street residence, there was a resumption
of the vomiting spells. Mrs. Bowers also
said that her husband was unable to take
the peptonized milk longer. As Dr. Lagen
had at this stage been summoned In
the case, Dr. McLaughlin refused to have
anything more to do with the patient.
A MAN WITH A METHOD.
A Practical Salesman Inaugurates a
Successful System for TTav
... ; eling .Men.
Mr. Charles S. Burhaus and wife of Elk
hart, Ind.,are visiting San Francisco on a
trip both of business and pleasure.
Mr. Burhaus holds one of the most re
sponsible positions In the business of the
Dr. Miles Medical Company, which ranks
as one of the leading patent medicine In
stitutions of the world.
He has the superintendence and direc
tion of over fifty traveling salesmen, and
has originated and perfected a system of
organization of his force that is said to
be nearer perfection than any other used
in this line of business. In some instances
men are routed for a ten months* trip be
fore returning to the home office, and yet
Mr. Burhaus' system is so minutely per
fect that he knows each day just where
his representative Is: Another feature
which has vastly extended his reputation
has been the establishment of a traveling
men's school of instruction, which con
sists of a- three weeks' course each year.
Early in July the men are called in from
the road and are organized into three
classes and daily are addressed upon top
ics pertaining to each feature and detail
of the business. They are Informed of
trade conditions existing in all parts of
the country, as well >as the banking and
crop situation, and are asked to freely co.
operate with the management in the dis
cussion of business policies for the ensu
ing year. Some Impression of the magni
tude of the business of this company may
be gained when it is known that nearly
200 men. are. on the pay roll and that dur
ing the year 20,000,000 pieces of literature
are distributed from house to house, be
sides mailing ,4,000,000 pieces of additional
matter to separate addresses. In view of
this enormous amount of postal material
Elkhart has been raised from the position
of < twelfth postofflce'ln importance in In
diana to fourth position. Mr. Burhaus
has been for nine years in the service of
the company and was for many years a
traveling salesman. Having spent several
weeks In Southern California and this city
he returns to the East in a few days.
The idea that cherry stones, grape seeds

on the line to Manawa and launches are
being used instead. But one railroad had
clear tracks out of the city to-day. East

BILLINGS, Mont., Aug. 23. â Word has
been received here from Moorcroft, VTyo.,
that the most disastrous cloudburst in the
history of that section occurred there yes
terday morning. Two large bridges on
the Burlington and a large amount of
trackage were washed out and destroyed,
delaying traffic from twelve to twenty
four hours. Two passenger trains are
stalled and It is not expected to get trains
through until late to-night.
The third was Â¦Willie Paulsen, who lost
his life in the flooded cellar of his home
in Council Bluffs.
OMAHA, Aug. 2S.â Three deaths are re
ported as a result of the high water.
Two of them were Jefferson Keep and
Edgar Hamilton, aged 10 and 11. in South

water and got beyond their depth and
were drowned before assistance could
reach them.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Aug. 2S.â The pre

To-day's movements consisted of a fierce
engagement, during which a landing party
of 1S0O men under Rear Admiral Coghlan
captured all the stations and defenses of
the Scape and Spurwin. The marines and
jackies landed almost at dawn and were
engaged until after noon, when they re
turned to the fleet, which had remained
off Rlchmonds Island all day. Rear Ad
miral Coghlan believed he had achieved
the grandest victory of the navy, but at
3:<5 Lieutenant Jordan. In command of the
engineer corps at the Two Lights, was in
formed by telephone that the umpires had
decided that no landing was effected by
the invaders, as the men and boats had
been put out of action before the landing
was attempted. Therefore the capture of
all the points on the Scape, including the
signal searchlight and flre control sta
tions at Two Lights, the defenses at Sil
ver Springs and the searchlight at Pond
Cove, was void, and they stand as if no
attempt had been made at their capture.
This left the Immense searchlights in
action for a demonstration to-night. Re
ports that the invaders were marching
upon the forts and the city prevailed, but
if such had been the intention it was not
carried out, the men returning to the
ships at 3M5. The men standing at the
entrenchments on Meeting House Hill,
three miles from the city, were reinforced
by COO men from the forts in anticipation
of an assault from the invaders or an at
tempt to march upon the city proper. The
capture of this force would require more
than 6000 Invaders.

to use caution and send the Smith cas<
out of his jurisdiction.
JUJtORS ARE SCARCE.
When the case was called to-day a large
number of residents of the county were
present.. Attorney Percy E. Fuller of San
Francisco represented the defendant and
Attorney James O'Keefe of Redwood City
acted as special prosecutor. The defense
waived a Jury trial but- the prosecution
followed the order of thlnga and twelve
men were called to the jury box. There
was considerable difficulty in getting a
jury. It appears that there are about
140 firemen in the little town and all
claim exemption from Jury duty on. that
score. Many more of the talesmen Were
not taxpayers and they were excused.
Even the superintendent of streets asked
to be relieved on the ground that his
services might be required at any mo
ment.
It was nearly 3 o'clock in the after
noon when eleven jurors had been chosen
and both sides agreed to try the case be
fore them. The prosecution outlined Its
case and placed on the stand as its first
witness Frank Martini. In a frank man
ner the witness related how Smith had
struck Migull and told what he knew of
the assault. Then Witness Vlncenso, with
Frank Albcrtonl acting as SCfi Interpreter,
corroborated Martini's testimony. The
complaining witness next took the wit
ness stand and testified that without
provocation and while ho was conversing
with Supervisor Debenedetti, Smith had
struck him and inflicted an ugly wound
over his eye. Dr. Emerson testified that
the wound must have been produced by
some blunt instrument.
SMITH BECOMES CONFUSED.
Wh6n the prosecution closed its case
Attorney Fuller asked for a dismissal,
first on the grounds that there was not
sufficient evidence to convict, and second
ly, that tho case was not being tried bo
fore the proper tribunal. Judge Booth de
nied the motion and the trial proceeded.
Smith's wltnesaes were all truthful. When
the. defendant was himself placed on the
stand he became confused under the fire
of cross-examination by Attorney
O'Keefe, and it* was evident from the Ex
pression on the faces of the Jurors what
their verdict would be. After Instructions
from the Judge a verdict of "guilty as
charged" was rendered. The defense
asked for a ten days' stay of execution. -
Charges against Constable Vallejo have
not yet been brought, but he is likely to
be called to account in the near future.
The disclosure of the jury transaction by
The Call created considerable excitement
in San Mateo County, and many of the
leading citizens express a hope that a
death blow will be Btruck to the alleged
corruption and that right and justice will
again prevail.
BAKERSFIELD, Aug. 28.â Paul W.
Bennett, Superior Judge of Kern County,
has filed with the register of the land
office at Visalia an application for patent
to the present site of the town of Hav

no title was ever acquired from the Gov
ernment When the Sierra forest reserve
was created the town was taken in and
the residents notified to move. Lands

The Rev. William Rader spoke on "The
Boy Problem" and took occasion to say
that the youth of the United States
needed reverence and respect for his eld
ers, and what' was most essential was
that he be obedient. If we taught our
boys obedience, more than we do, said
Mr.' Rader, there would be no such thing
as trying to capture escaped criminals.
He would have boy's value obedience, ob
serve respect for parental authority and
national statutes and civic law. He de
plored what he called the "slaughter
houses of boys' virtue," which he said
exist in San Francisco. Â» â¢
â¢ Mr. Rader said he believed in the cul
tivation of manliness In youth and he ob
jected to the effeminate boy as much as
he disliked the masculine girl. He wanted
to see the manly boy and the womanly
girl all thje time. He extolled the great
old teachers of the past and said that the
home was the great Institution; It was, he
said, the thermometer of the republic
San Francisco, said Mr. Rader, needed
the home more. than anything else and
the Sunday-school should be the exten
sion of the home. He warned the Sun
day-school that It must be simple and
possess the naturalness and all tho
atmosphere of the home.
The result of the election of officers for
the ensuing year was as follows:
Mr. . Guthrie, speaking especially to the
teachers,' told them they should ask
themselves whether they were teachers
in name or teachers in fact. It was not
the letter "they wanted, he said, but the
spirit. The three essentials for a teacher
were first to "Know whom you would
teach" ; second, "What you are to teach,"
and third, "How to teach it."
OBEDIENCE IN YOUTH.
Later a general session, over which the
Rev. Dr. H. H. Bell presided, was opened
with prayer by the Rev. Dr. F. M. Larkin,
the devotion being followed by an address
entitled "The Art of Questioning," by the
Rev. "W. K. Guthrie.
LITERATURE FOB YOTJTH.
Mr. Jopson then, alluded -to -the litera
ture best for young people and youth' to
read, for, he said, the child being Im
pressionable must of necessity be I in
fluenced for good or evil by ;thÂ» reading
matter placed in its hand. While, the Sun
day school had a home department, so he
said had infidelity its home department,
hence it was absolutely necessary to
guard youth in the choice of literature.
Mr. Jopson said that the home depart
ment sowed and gathered in the harvest, j
It reached- the people by invitation and
reached them also by personal contact.
The perpetual house to house vi3it, he
said, had been attended by untold success.
It reached those who were unable to at
tend the Sunday school and those who
would not, but were later won over.
The address was received with the
heartiest applause. .
I. N. Halliday gave an adress on "The
Normal Department," dealing primarily j
with the training of teachers, and sounded
a warning note' against controversial
study of the Bible, which, he said, had
caused turmoil in the world at various
periods.
Mrs. G. R. Alden delivered an address
on "Reading Matter for Young People,"
and C. R. Fisher spoke on "District Or
ganization."
At the evening session the first business,
to be transacted was that of the super
intendents of Sundayrschools^ of the city.
There were addresses by L. H. Carey on
"The Sunday-school Library," another by
A. A. Macurda on "The Music of the
Sunday-school"; "Graded Work of the
School," by A. S. Johnson, and "Rela
tion of the Individual Sunday-school to
the State "Work," by C. R. Fisher.
The San Francisco Sunday School As
sociation met in . annual convention
yesterday fit the Central Methodist Epis
copal Church. The Rev.. W. M. Whlta
presided and the attendance far outnum
bered that at last year's convention."
The convention was opened .with, prayer
by the Rev. E. Nelapder, who was fol
lowed by the Rev. C. W. Jopson, -'whoaa
address on "The Home Department" was
forcible and full of pointed argument In
favor of taking and maintaining the open
Bible wltftln the .home.
In every home, said Mr. Jopson, the
"home department"- -was -the- courier 1 of
the word of God. The crucial problem of
the day was the home, he said, and as
the home advanced so did the world, be
cause the home molded life and charac
ter and individual. * / â¢Â¦,, '-â¢ .
Mr. Jopson eaid that the home must
again take its .responsibility and share
in the work of the Sunday School. He
praised and showed the power and Influ
ence of "mothere* meetinga/V which led
him to remind his hearers that "the hand
that rocked the cradle. ruled the world."

GAS COMPANY BLAMED
FOB McNAMARA'S DEATH
Deadly Fluid Escapes From a De
fective Meter and Kills an
Old Man.
The inquest on the body of Daniel Mc-
Namara, which vra.s continued from June
39. was concluded yesterday, the Jury
bringing in a verdict that death was
caused on May SO by suffocation from the
inhalation of illuminating gas which had
leaked from a defective meter. The Jury
added the following censure: "We find
the gas company responsible for the de
fect in said meter."
McNarnara was SO years of age and re
sided with his family at 2474 Broadway.
He was found dead in his bed on the
morning of May SO. Dr. Henry Gibbons
Jr. was called in and. not having been
informed as to the escaping gas, gave
his opinion that death had been caused
by heart disease, and a report to that
effect was telephoned to the Coroner's
office. The autopsy surgeon ascertained
on opening the body that McNamara had
been suffocated by illuminating gas. and
an Investigation by the Coroner"s depu
ties brought to light the fact that gas
leaking from the meter had escaped dur
ing the night Into McNamara's bedroom
and killed him.

"I am very grateful for what Dr. Miles

from valvtdar heart disease for many years.
in fact ever since I was a little riii and for
three years before I began using Heart Cure
I was in very bad shape. I could not sleep
on xa y left side at all and would frequently
have the most dreadful smothering $ pells.
At times tnj left side would swell up. I had
pain in my head all the time from which I
suffered- greatly. Nothing I took did me

Miles' Heart Cure which removed all these
distressing symptoms and made me feel well

EDUCATION RULES.
Against this movement neither military
equipment nor immigration laws will In the
long run be of any avail. In view of this state
of things civilization, as represented .by the
Anglo-Paxon nations. Is pursuing a policy of
aggressive defense. Under the tutelage of
these nations, whether expressed through
schools or the institutions of Industry, the bar
barian Is led to lay aMde his barbarism and
become an ally of ctvlllzed society. The rule
of these nations Is an educational process. On
whatever point the Instruction bears, whether
on any of the numberless arts of peace or even
on the art of war, the result Is essentially the
same â the persons affected are brought nearer
the standards of civilization. The process of
education directed to any end recognized In an
enlightened state Imposes a sense of social obli
gation and responsibility which transforms the
barbarian and puts him on the side of civili
zation.
In a great nation culture has n certain mo
mentum that Is wanting where a people Is
broken up into a large number of petty inde
pendent States. When, therefore, the inhabi
tants of a small State or an Isolated region
are drawn into close union with a great na
tion, they are bound to be affected by tha cur
rent of that nation's life, and to be carried on
toward a higher phase of civilization by the
momentum of its culture. By this process of
education thÂ» Aryan race now dominant In the
world is relieving the helplessness of the stag
nant races and preparing for the perpetuity of
civilization by the abolition of barbarism.
The meeting was also the occasion for
the leave taking of Professor Kendric C.
Babcock, professor of history, who was
recently elected to the presidency of the
University of Arizona. Professor Bab
cock paid tributes to former President
Martin Kellogg and President Wheeler
and the university that he said had ma
terially assisted in his education.
basing their security now on their superior com
mand of the force of destruction. But the
threatening barbarians may be already within
the limits of the field claimed for civilization,
or a barbarian Invasion may be peaceful, con
tinuing through many decades and leaving, in
the end, the society Invaded composed of new
elements and animated by strange purposes.
Against an uprising of internal barbarism
or an invasion like this a powerful military or
ganization furnishes no defense. The ques
tion of the power of barbarism to overwhelm
civilization is more than a Question of idle
speculation. The recent legislation by several
nations of Aryan stock against the Invasion of
the Chinese, the loud demand for restriction
on immigration from other nations and the
tising tide of Internal barbarism In certain
countries Indicate that the question is emi
nently practical. The consideration that has
moved legislators to provide for the exclusion
of unwelcome elements Is not the fear that
there will be more laborers than will be needed
to perform the work required in the countries
In question, but that the unrestrained cunning
of members of alien races will break down the
existing btandards of living and substitute bar
barism for civilization.
The force of the desire to migrate Is des
tined to increase with the increasing contact of
nations and the development of the facilities
for movement. Awaken the lower races from
their passive condition. Infect them with the
fever of progress and they will find their ter
ritory too narrow for their expanded desires.
Japan, scarcely half a century out of her
stagnant medlaeva'.ism. feels already the In
fluence to move and to seek a broader field for
her stimulated national spirit. Sooner or later
the other nations of the Orient will be aroused
to progressive activity/ The noise of Western
steamships In their harbors, the roar of rail
road trains across their fields and the rattle of
Western industry in their cities will render the
continuance of their long slaep impossible, and
they will learn that facilities for traveling
have made the territory of every nation con
tiguous to that of every other nation.
The education of the less advanced racea
under Influences proceeding from Western na
tions la Important in that It enlarge* the area
of popular progress - and contributes to the
preservation of the higher forms of civilization.
It is almost Inevitable that we should believe
In the permanence of our Institutions. Each
age regards Itself exempt from the forces that
have ruined the cultivation of preceding ages.
Yet In eplte of this belief, whenever a society
has fallen. It has succumbed to forces that
ruined Its predecessors. It has succumbed to
barbarism, either the barbarism of the.in
vading stranger or barbarism generated within
by governmental oppression or neglect. Against
invading barbarians civilized nations are
MENACE OF BARBARISM.
If on? is so thoroughly and uncompromisingly
a radical as to be irritated by the opposition
to secular education which the church has
sometimes expressed, he In hardly in a posi
tion to deal rationally with any social ques
tion. He fails to appreciate the compelling
force of a great tradition. He apparently ex
pects progress to be achieved by a series of
social miracles. This is not the method by
which society is moved from one stage to an
other. In general old traditions and old opin
ions are only gradually worn away and sup
planted by new opinions and new ambitions.
The rhurch. the oldest, the stablest, the most
consistent of European institutions, has a his
tory which no generation can ignore, and It
would not be true to Its past and Its tradi
tional opinions If it did not proclaim Its belief
in the superiority , of the Instruction which It
provides to any that may be offered by secular
authority. But an opinion, even an old opin
ion, does not establish a fact. . The church In
the Philippine Islands has accomplished a
great undertaking in turning the people from
barbarlEm toward civilization, and It has still
before It a task sufficiently Important to en
gage all Its force without departlnr from Its
legitimate field. Between thia field and the
proper realm of state action the founders of thÂ«
Government of the United States have fixed
a line of demarkation in separating the state
frcm the church.
In view of the ambitions and hereditary pur
poses cf the church there was no reasonable
ground to expect that It would co-operate un
conditionally with the Government In the work
of secularizing instruction. For centuries the
church h;;s been the dominant factor in the
affairs of the Islands. It had aimed, with a
lofty cufDOBe. to educate end convert the in
habitants and to bring them into loyal and
devoted submission to its authority. Its long
service In the campaign against barbarism
had made It profoundly conscious of Its great
misflon. and It was morally impossible for it
suddenly to transfer iÂ«& sympathies and sup
port from ecclesiastical to secular instruct Icn.
The establishment of a eystem of secular
public instruction in the Phlltpplne Islands,
where previously all instruction had been di
rected by etclesiastlcal authority, was a very
conspicuous experiment. Many factors in the
problem could not be determined beforehand.
It could not be known in advance whether it
would bÂ» possible or not to secure an ade
quate number of teachers of the quality re
quired to carry thr undertaking to a mjecess
tul issue. In was recoffnized that we had to
do with Dersons whose only conception of a
Â¦schooi was that it was a subordinate adjunct
to the church and It was uncertain what would
be their attitude toward the new system. It
could not. moreover, be known in advance to
what extent the authority of the church would
be effective In preventing children from attend
ing secular schools.
ATTITUDE OF CHURCH.
It is not to be denied that in establishing
nÂ«w conditions for the Filipinos much has been
done that is essentially experimental in char
acter. This fact, however, does not Involve a
condemnation. When viewed In the proper
light the art of government appears to con
sist \-ery largely of experiments. Every law
that Is passed Is framed to meet conditions
(subsequent to the time of Its passage, and,
consequently, these conditions cannot be fully
known at th? time the law is made. Further
more, the factors of practical problems hi dif
ferent period* or in different countries in the
same period are always more or less unlike.
It follow*, therefore, that every legislative act
is more or less of an experiment. Where we
have to do with the Imperfectly known psy
chological factors of n. strange race our acts
have in a larger measure than elsewhere an
experimental character.
The Filipinos are Christians, and aÂ» Christ
ians their view of Die position ot women in
society ts net treatly different from the view
entertained by other Christian peoples. It is
essentially the eame view as that entertained
by the more conservative Western nation.-.,
| who deem it quite proper that girls should be
' taupht by women rather tha.n by men. In es
j tabllshing the new eystem of Instruction good
policy and a decent regard for the ideas and
prejudice* of the Filipino pecple demanded
that the sirls. at least in the larger towns,
ehould have an oooortunity to be tauKbt by
women. If. In making provision to this end. It
to happened that a certain number of boys
feil under the instruction of women the In
convenience was not serious. In fact, there
was no inconvenience at all. It is a very good
thing for the youthful Filipino to l?arn early
that In civilization woman hao a place of au
thority. It was. therefore, not a mistake to
employ a certain number of American women
us teacher* In the Philippine*. They per
formed an important function as Instructors
of children ajid at the same time they set a
standard of efficiency for the native women
teachers with whom they were associated.
With rare exceptions they were women of good
attainments, of high character and of nobl<5
purposes, and the Hervice they have rendered
and are etill rendering merits the most cordial
commendation.
WOMEN ARE WELCOMED.
who supported the project to employ women as
teachers in the Orient. The mockery of the
unbelieving is apparently based on the as
sumption that the social character of one part
of the Far East Is likÂ» that o: every othÂ«>r
part. In countries where woman has no social
position and where heaven Is conceived to be
open to her or.ly when vouched for by man It
would probably not be expedient to srnd Ameri
can women a* teachers without some prelimin
ary work In preparing the way. But In th*
Philippine Islands the way has been prepared
by the Spanish missionaries and the domina
tion of the church.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE

Mrs. Kate Lewis Smith, the petitioner
in the guardianship proceedings, came
here with Mrs. Hutton from San Fran
cisco. Attorney Brown declares he does
not know who she is further than that
she resides in San Francisco and is the
wife of a late Colonel Smith. He says
Mrs. Hutton brought Mrs. Smith to his
office and reauested that the guardian
ship proceedings be commenced.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 28.â Another move was
made in the Hutton divorce suit to-day
which tends to show that the San Fran
cisco Police Commissioner and his wife
have become reconciled. The develop
ments canie out op the hearing of a pe
tition in Judge Hyland's court to have
a guardian appointed for Mrs. Inez S.
Hutton. Police Commissioner Hutton was
present in court, as was also Attorney
Brown for Mrs. Smith, the petitioner.
Mrs. Hutton was not present, and Attor
ney Brown said he did not know where
she was. He asked for a continuance in
order that he might locate her. Hutton
objected, and asked that the guardianship
matter be dismissed. He claimed that
he held the power of attorney from his
wife to have the petition for guardianship
and also the divorce suit recently brought
by her dismissed. Hutton declared he
did not know where his wife was and
refused to aid in locating her.
Judge Hyland said the proceedings were
rather mysterious. "Here is a man,"
said he, "who Is being sued for divorce
by his wife and asking to have her de
clared mentally incompetent coming into
court and claiming power of attorney and
asking that the actions commenced by
her be dismissed."
He then ordered that a citation be is
sued for Mrs. Hutton to appear in court.
After the court adjourned Hutton filed
documents which give him power of at
torney to dismiss the guardianship mat
ter, and also the dismissal of Attorney
Delmas as attorney In the divorce suit.
The papers are signed by Mrs. Hutton.
A motion for the dismissal of the divorce
suit was also filed.
Mrs. Hutton. who had been at the Gar
den City Sanitarium in East San Jose,
left the city last Monday. It. Is said that
she has left the" State and will be absent
for at least a year.
Special DlBpatch to The Call.'
WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.-The published
statement that Secretary Shaw bad de
cided that under existing laws he was
authorized to segregate Government re
ceipts from Internal revenue sources and
deposit the same at his discretion in
national bank depositories does not raise
a new question, although such deposits
as have been made heretofore had not been
previously covered Into the treasury. As
early as 1878, the courts of the United
States held in effect that the national de
positories are part of the treasury of the
United States, so far as their authority to
hold public deposits is concerned.
The secretary, so far as can be learned,
has not determined the deposit of any
further funds with the national bank:--.
but has decided It is well within his pro
vince to make such deposits and with a
view to meeting any possible money con
tingency hereafter he has segregated the
Internal revenue receipts from other re
ceipts and has opened a separate account
in the treasury ledgers, so that in case
of need he may know just what amounts
are available for this purpose.
' . The cannery men saw an absolute fail
ing of the run facing them four years
from now. They, therefore, wired Â¦ to the
Government asking for the declaring of
a closed season for the next fortnight.
For that time neither fishing nor can
ning should be done and the fish were to
be given a chance of getting up-river, but
the Government declined to act, because,
so it Is alleged, fishermen whose votes ar^
wanted by the Government would lose
that two weeks^ fishing. All Canadian
canners, however, are now refusing to
buy fish, and to-night large sales are be
ing made from Canadian, waters to can
neries on the American side.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 28.â "It Is
time we were annexed to the United
States if we ever expect to get laws that
will fill the needs of the salmon-packing
industry." This statement was made this
afternoon by George I. Wilson, the larg
est cannery owner and business head of
the Fraztr River Packers' Association,
which owns fifty canneries and Kas'sev^
eral million dollars invested on the Fraser
River.
"The entire industry is in danger of ob
literation," he continued. "We have asked
the Government to move In the matter,
but nothing- has been done. The Govern
ment cf the United States appears to be
wise enough to conserve its fishing inter
ests."
The case complained -.of is- this: The
salmon- run thia season on the Fraser
River and Puget Sound has been very
poor. Less than one-sixth of an ordinary
pack has been available. Salmon which
go up the river at this time of the year to
the spawning grounds produce eggs which
mature into full-grown salmon and come
back to the river in the fourth year from
now. James P. Babcock, Fisheries In
spector, formerly of California, astounded
the cannery managers yesterday with the
news that not q. single salmon this year
had- reached the spawning grounds up
river, for all had been caught at the
mouth of the river.
WASHINGTON, AujT. 28.â It was said
to-day at the State Department that Min

should not be a consenting party to the
surrender of the six Chinese subjects who
were arrested by the authorities of the
foreign settlement In Shanghai in July
last and put on trial on a charge of
sedition before the mixed court of the set
tlement and whom the consular body of
Shanghai refused to surrender on the
demand of the Chinese Government for
punishment according to Chinese custom.
Minister Conger was instructed that he
should take the ground that the judicial
procedure which was adopted under a
formal agreement with the Tao Tal of
Shanghai phould be carried out, with ap
propriate punishment in the settlement In
case of conviction. This Government, it
was stated to-day, has never departed
from Its original position In the matter
and never has had any intention of giv
ing up these men.

INSTRUCTION IN LANGUAGE.
Industrial education In the Philippines en
counters two embarrassment*. The first of
tteaa is the lack of desire to engage in In
dustry; rnort of the young men who are ablÂ»
to rise above the position of a house servant
rr a coachman preferring to be messenger* or
clerks under the Government, or to seek their
fortunes â¢ in the profesÂ«ions. ' The second em
barrassment is found in tÂ».Â« difficulty of ren
dering efficient instruction In th? industries
in non-Industrial communities, it is true that
*r>me knowledge of industrial processes may be
conveyed by lnFtru^tlon in schools, provided
the people to whom the instruction is given is
already domlnflte/l by the industrial spirit: but
if this spirit does not prevail the schools are
rowcrlPFs through lack of interested pupils
Hitherto the industrial spirit has not been de
veloped among the Filipinos and industrial
schools ar* not likely to be of much Im
portance, until society shall have acquired a
morÂ«Â» decidedly Industrial character. There Is
nothing In the Filipino's history nor in hi*
present attitude to indicate that his unaided
efforts during the next fifty years win bring
cbout any very remarkable change in his at
titude toward industry, or that without the
influence of the practical examples of mod
ern industrial life, he will, to any considerable
rxtenU modify his purposes and ambitions
Â« ith respect to the conduct of economi-- af
fairs. Like ell other people in the lower
grades of civilization, "he Is bound by powerful
conservative instinct* to the social forms and
occupations of his past; and his past has very
little to reveal In the field of art or indus
try.
His history when viewed from the side of
art and industry and compared with the his
tory of Japan or China is a barren waste.
But nothing would do more to change his at
titude and to develop in him the ambitions
which lie at the foundations of Industrial bo-
Hety than to see Industry growing up around
him and its interest becoming the dominant
interests within his view. Such a transforma
tion can be brought about only by the Intro
duction of new skill and new Industrial power
from a foreign source. The laborers Intro
duced may bÂ» employed in building ships,
making railroads and highways and doing all
the heavier work required to reveal and utilize
the wealth of a virgin country. The doing
of this heavier work would greatly increase
the demand for such labor as the Filipino's
strength and talent enable him to furnish, and
fcy this means his economic position would be
materially Improved. Under conditions like
Thejse the Filipinos might acquire the Indus
trial spirit, and be induced to accept the in
xtructlon and Incentives to Industry that would
Iff all around them.
DIFFICULTIES PRESENTED
This exclusive and persistent contemplation
of a sincle subject, and that onÂ«? within the
realm of unrealities, necessarily limits the in
tellectual horizon and makes the mind In
hcspltable. These who go out from this school

have become specialists In relleion. Th^lr

but it does not tend to develop power in prac
tical affairs. Mohammedan Instruction touches
life at only one point. \ few men from Eng

The men of the East can scln as fine a

but thrlr weakness appears In the presence
at practical problems; and this weakness is
lxrcely the result of defective training. It
cannot be reasonably expected that men trained
under a system like that of the Mohammedan
rchoGll will have either interest or knowledge
in practical affairs. And wherever, as was
the case -In the Philippine Inlands under the
Kranish rrginie. education is directed and con

There shouM be _a tendency to lay more stress

SYSTEM OF WRONG.
BERKELEY, Jlu*. 2S.-Professor
Bernard Mores, the former Philip
pine Commissioner and professor
of history a.t the University of
California, believes that If trar
and rebellion are the price of education
In the Philippines we must Insist on foot
ing: the bill. Thrre is no retreat, no al
ternative, he sars, and an enlightened
policy must prevail, the Filipinos must be
educated in the arts and practices of civ
ilization no matter what the cost.
Professor Moses e&ve expression to his
opinions at the university meeting In
Harmon gyxr.naslum, which was under
stood to be a formal welcome to him upon
his return to the university after three
years' absence. His subject was "The
Education of the Stranger." After de
scribing the policy of the Dutch to Java,
which aims to keep the native In sub
jection through Ignorance. Processor
Moses contrasted it with that of the pol
icy of the Americans In the Philippines.
He said In part:
In" tho Philippine* Â» widely different plan
raÂ« beÂ«i entertained. VaAtr thi. plan It la
ProotTd "rSrnlrt Â«uch facilities to the
ftUxflBM that Jack of opportunity to acquire
tkTi.Qul.lt* training- shÂ«Jl never be Â« .barrier
to th^lr obtaining ar.y position to which they
zr.ay legitimately aspire.
bound by principle.
This policy naturallr awakens in the minds
of our Dutch many doubts as to Us wisdom.
The Dutch are disposed to estimate the virtues
of 'their Oriental dependent* according to thÂ«
humility and rubmlMlveness displayed, and to
regard with many mleylvlnsB thÂ« discontent
end the seme of personal Independence de
veloped by education. They are. moreover,
jersuaded that a large knowledge will breed
rebellion and war. Our position In thi* mat
ter is. however. *uch the! if education brings
rebellion and war we are obliged to Insist on
education. We have no alternative. As Amer
icans w* are committed by our form of gov
ernment and by the traditional purposes of
our society to eland for â¢ducation, not only
her* between the ehores of the Atlantic and
the Pacific, but on every ehorÂ» that lies under
the authority of thi. nation. If war comes
hj> a consequence of education we are obliged
to accept It. and. by the grace of God and
the devotion of the army, to ma*o thÂ« best
cf It. Even war Is better than peace that
can be maintained enly by Ignorance.
The principle which It is expected will con
tinue to be carried out In the Philippine Ifl
sneis is the same principle that should con
trol thÂ« educational rxjlicy here and every
where. It 1b that the systematic Instruction
of the school should touch the life of society
at all possible points. The most complete
currying out cf this principle is found In the
educational systems of those natlcns who6Â«
schools of the various grades deal with all
the departments of knowledge needed to further
the material as well as the Intellectual pro
gress of society. The other extreme, where
instruction touches society at only one or a
few points. In found in the Oriental school.
A few months ago I visited in Cairo the
rÂ«>ntral university of the Mohammedan world.
The floors of Its immense halls were covered
with matting and en this wero seated, singly
or in iittle groups, thousands of students.
From the youngest to the oldest they were
all committing to memory and repeating pas
sages from their common text book â the Koran.
For them the utterances of the prophet con
stituted their s<">le subject of contemplation.
Sometime* in an apparent ecstasy, sometimes
in drowsy Indifference, their bodies swaying
Tackward and forward, or from side to side,
they repeat hour after hour the Koran's state
ments of Mohammedan theology and morals.

bill and the King's visit that it seems quite
likny we are to have what will be virtually a new
Irelandâ one as notable for prosperity and good
humor as the old has been for adversity and discon
tent. It is not the land bill alone that is to do the
work of redemption, for it seems that now that
good fortune has turned toward them the Irish are
going to have it in about every way that it can
come to a people.
In the first place there has been so much satisfac
tion among the English over the reception given by
the Irish to King Edward that many of the more
influential papers of London are urging the King
to establish a residence in Ireland and visit the
country at least once a year, as he does Scotland.
It is argued that a royal residence in Ireland would
be an inducement to men of wealth to establish
country homes there, and the result would be benefi
cial in many ways, as the social gayety surrounding
the court would break the monotony of Irish life,
lessen the discontent of the people and lead to the
expenditure m Ireland of a great deal of money that
would stimulate nearly all lines of local trade.
Another movement of note is that of the proposed
establishment of a strong naval port and base of
supplies on the south coast of Ireland. A military
authority says: "A glance at the map will show that
the western capes of Ireland, thrust out, as it were,
into the Atlantic, lie in a strategic position of great
importance in the event of a war with a first-class
European power. Were Great Britain at war with
a foe having a formidable navy it would be to some
point along the Irish coast that vessels laden with
grain from Canada or the United States would make,
whether under convoy or otherwise, before proceed
ing to their destination on the south and east coasts
of England." The establishment and maintenance
of such a port will be a direct benefit to the locality
selected and indirectly of advantage to the island as
a whole.
The most important prediction of a new Ireland
comes, however, from a representative not of courts
nor of armies, but of commerce. Mr. C. C. Shayne,
president of the Merchants' and Manufacturers'
Board of Trade of New. York, in a recent interview
has declared a conviction that Ireland is to be the
future great commercial distributing ground of the
international trade between America and Europe. As
the military authorities see in Ireland a strategic
point of advantage in war, so he sees in it a strategic
point of advantage in commerce, and predicts that
in a comparatively short time there will be built up
on the coast of Ireland a commercial port of first
class importance.
In explaining the reasons for his prediction Mr.
Shayne said: "We are nearing the era of steamships
with a tonnage of 40,000. The new vessels of the
Cunard line â to be the largest on the ocean â will
have a length of 765 feet, with a tonnage of 3S,ooo,
and I predict that the ships which the German and
the White Star lines may be expected to build to sur
pass them will reach the tonnage I have named. For
Â«uch vessels to go to Liverpool will be impossible,

of the many orecautions that their vast size wouM

Frederick Law Olmsted was born at
Hartford. Conn, April 2G. 1S22. He was a
student at Yale In 1S43 and In later years
received the degree of A. M. from Am
herst and of LL.D. from Harvard and
Yale. In 1S57 he became landscape archi
tect and superintendent of Central Park,
New York. From 1S61 to 1863 he wa3 sec
retary of the United States Sanitary
Commission. Subsequently ho laid out
public parks in many large cities, the
grounds and terrace of the Capitol at
Washington, the Stanford University
grounds and was the landscape architect
of the World's Fair at Chicago. He was
the author of "Walks and Talks of an
American Farmer," "Our Seaboard Slave
States," "A Journey Through Texas"
and "A Journey to the Back Country."
A considerable part of the range on the public do
main was protected from destruction by unlawful
fer^cs. The GovvnmenÂ£2has ordered these torn
down and the work is now in prognj^s. While the
fences were illegal, they did protect meadow that
will now disappc .ââ¢ and give plice to the desert.
The season of grazing that is just ending has been
characterized by many violent conflicts between
stockmen battling for th<Â£)pa^>ire. In these con
flicts twenty murders have been committed and sev
eral hundred thousand dollars' worth of property
has been destroyed. The present aspect of the prob
lem seems at last to have aroused fche/^Hiblic men of
the West to action. Time was that e^cry Western
Governor opposed leasing, and at their meeting in
Salt Lake City two years ago they resolved against
it Now a change is noted in that typicalljQ^razing
State. Wyoming, whose Governor, Mr. Chatterton,
replying to a request for his views, says: "The arbi
trary and, without legal authority therefor, drawing
of 'dead lines' by parties in interest is a constant
source of trouble and injustice and a continual men
ace to the peace of communities where it prevails.
The only practical solutionjjf the question that I am
able to satisiy myself is just, equitable and for the
best interests of the greatest number in the present
and for future generations is the leasing of the ranges
on the pubhc domain. The State, through a board
of competent men, should have control of the leas
ing. The board should be selected not because of
party affiliation, for this is a business proposition,
but because of their integrity, business qualifications
ai.d knowledge of conditions and the means of ob
taining thr object in view.
"The lands should be apportioned on some equita
ble basis according to the realty holdings of actual
settlers and, after they are provided for, to actual
resident stock owners. The number of head of live
stock allowed to be grazed should be limited ac
cording to the pasturage quality of the land, so that
overstocking would not prevail as now and the fu
ture thereby be provided for. The rental should be
nominal, say, one or one-half cent per acre, so the
small ranchmen may take advantage of this means of
protection. This would stop the 'dead line,' keep
oot nomadic sheep, which are such a menace, not
only to our resident stockmen but Jo the peace and
quiet of those sections now infested by them. Give
sheep and cattle separate grazing grounds; preserve
peace and insure the permanency of the pasturage.
It would require two or three years to get the plan
perfected and rightly adjusted, and those doing it
would be subjected to adverse criticism; but if the
board were honest, industrious and firm, five years
would bring greatly beneficial results to all inter
ests. I find a large majority of those to whom I
have talked favor such a method. Those who oppose
it are generally the owners of hrge flocks and herds
who have no home in Wyoming."
If Wyoming conclude that permanency of stock
ranging is better than its destruction and that law,
order and peace on the range are better than disor
der, homicide and destruction of property, the other
stock-growing States should hasten to join her in
putting the curative policy promptly in action.
THE CALL pioneered the issue of leasing the
stock range on the public domain. It was and
is a question of the ufmost importance to the
cunsumers of beef and mutton, and affects the very
life of the range industry of the West. We predicted
i progressive rise in the price of meat, caused by
the destruction of the range through its occupancy
in common, and consequent overstocking and ex
tirpation of the pasture. All of these things have
come to pass. The economics of the people are seri
ousiy affected by the high price of meat. The range
industry' is in distress and the desert is spreading
wh<rc the 'meadoyr? are destroyed at the rate of
five millions of acres a year. Western Congressmen
have been slow to realize the problem and enter upon
its solution, and the stockmen themselves, while
aware of their misery, were in disagreement as to its
cause. President Rooseve',t. fully informed in it by
his knowledge of the West and his experience as a
cattle ranger, sought to reach a solution by a com
mission authorized by Congress to examine and re
port legislation. The last Congress adjourned with
out action.

OWING to the great amount of loss caused
to the New England States early in the sum
mer by forest fires something more than or
dinary attention is being given in the East this year
to the problem of preventing the spread if not the
outbreak of such fires and thus conserving the for
ests. Serious damages resulting from fires in the
woods have been occurring in the East every year
since ever white man settled there, and yet, accord
ing to the National Bureau of Forestry, only three
States in the Unionâ New York, Pennsylvania and
Minnesota â have made even so much as a system
atic attempt to prevent them.
The West of course suffers from this cause more in
proportion than the East, because the West has now
larger forests and the fires are more extensive. Es
timates of the losses by woodland fires last year are
to the effect that in Oregon and Washington alone
damage to the amount of $20,000,000 was done within
two weeks by the big fires which will be readily re
called. Those fires were exceptionally disastrous, but
it is estimated that taking the country as a whole the
loss has averaged upward of $30,000,000 annually for
the past twenty years.
Since there are three States in the Union that
have made "systematic attempts" at the prevention of
forest fires there are ample precedents for a fourth
State to follow, and the State that first hastens to
take up the work ought to be California. We have
thus far escaped with comparatively little loss by
fires in the woods and fields this year, but the dry
season is not yet over. Even as it is the loss, if it
could be fully computed) would be found to be far in
excess of what a scientific system of forestry would
entail in the way of expenditure.
The Bureau of Forestry has undertaken to promote
forest preservation in all the States and Territories,
and is now making careful studies on the subject. A
recent review of its work says: "The three States
having fire protection systems are said to have effi
cient ones, and the Government experts will ".study
their workings carefully; but what would do in one
section would not do in another, and each district
will be studied as to its peculiar needs. Then when
the Government has formulated its system it can
apply it to the Federal domain and suggest to the dif
ferent States the passage of suitable laws. Further it
cannot go, but in view of the immense annual loss
now incurred it would seem as if no State would re
fuse to act upon the suggestions of the Government.

To those who wish well for California nothing can
be more encouraging than the fact, recently an
nounced, that the registration of students at Stanford
and at Berkeley is extremely large this year. Good
education makes it impossible for men and women
so to conduct themselves as to reflect bad citizen
ship.
Mrs. Prag was prevailed upon to with
draw her resolution and the one present
ed by Mr. Sturges was adopted without
much opposition.
Principal Brooks of the Girls' High
School spoke in favor of the resolution in
troduced by Mrs. Prag. President Wood
ward took occasion to say that the teach
ers could do more toward securing the
raise in the salary by appealing to the
Supervisors than the Board of Ed
ucation could accomplish. He said the
members of the board had added $90,000
to the amount asked for the School De
partment and this was not even consid
ered by the Supervisors when making up
the budget. He said the School Depart
ment had $140,000 less this year than last
to carry out Its important work. School
Director Mark also spoke. He said he
would do all In his power to help the
teachers increase the fund. He suggested
that the teachers organize and appeal to
the Supervisors who were up for election
next month.
Professor McCarthy was of the opinion
that the proper thing to do was to appeal
to the Board of Supervisors and not to
the Board of Education. "We mu3t have
more money," he said, "or the annui
tants must get leas salary. We have
thirty-nine on the list, and they will draw
very nearly $1170 a month. Either the
Board of Supervisors must help us more
or the teacehrs must Increase their con
tributions. I think If the teachers vote
to pay the $30 they should make it condi
tional. It is the duty of all teachers to
bind themselves to such an agreement.
It would not be fair for fifty teachers to
pay it and fifty not to pay it."
FAVORS RESOLUTION.
That In order to continue in force and make
benprtcial and to pro%'lde a fund for the pen
sioning of teachers the salary of tach teacher
now in the employ of the San Francisco School
Department be increased by the sum of $2, the
said $2 to be retained from each teacher and
paid Into the Teachers" Annuity Fund.
Be It resolved. That the Board of Educa
tion of this city and county be respectfully
requested to act upon the following resolution:
When the motion was before the meet
ing Mrs. Prag arose and read a long
statement In which she protested against
the of the sum. She said many
teachers could not pay the money, others
would not give it and she believed no one
should do so. She then told of the condi
tions existing In other cities. She proved
by statistics that teachers were better
paid in the Eastern cities and that the
annuity funds in New York, Philadelphia
and other Eastern cities were assisted by
the boards of education and by special
legislative enactments.
She then introduced a substitute for th6
motion. It was In part as follows:
President Woodward of the Board of
Education was chairman of the meeting.
At the outset of the meeting he deplored
the fact that the attendance was not as
large as it should be. He said the sub
ject was an important one and since the
teachers are contributing their money
they should be present to take part in
the proceedings, lie read a statement
prepared by Assistant Secretary Berliner,
which showed the condition of the annuity
fund. The statement showed that 852 day
school teachers contributed II a month to
the fund and that eighty-seven night
school teachers contributed 50 cents each
month. The total contributions for July
amounted to $S96 50. In one year these
contributions would aggregate $10,746. He
read that the total amount In the fund on
July 1 was $25,210. Of this sum $20,492 was
bearing interest and $4718 was in the
hands of the City and County Treasurer
and not drawing interest.
He showed there were thirty-nine an
nuitants. Of this number twenty-eight
were drawing the maximum amount and
eleven were drawing for services ren
dered. The total amount paid out each
month to annuitants was $1105 and this
would amount to $13,260 a year. He
showed there were at present 104 day
school teachers and thirty evening school
teachers who were not contributors to the
fund. President "Woodward thought It
would be a good plan to bring them into
the fold. He said he understood the
teachers who were not contributors had
ninety days in which to get In.
"The proposition is to have each of you
contribute $30 and thus put the fund in
good shape," said the president. "I would
like to have the Supervisors give you $2 a
month extra salary and this amount be
devoted to the annuity fund." This state
ment was applauded.
Horace Mann was Introduced and ex
plained the condition of the teachers' an
nuity fund and told of the efforts made
by the Commissioners to carry out its
provisions. He outlined its history and
his explanations were lucid. At the con
clusion of his address he made a motion
that it be the sense of the meeting that
a form of application be circulated among
the teachers, asking them to agree to pay
$30 into the permanent fund accumulated
for the teachers' annuity fund.
MRS. PRAG PROTESTS
The foregoing resolution was adopted
at a special meeting of the teachers of
the Ban Francisco School Department,
held Jn the auditorium of the Girls' High
School yesterday afternoon. It was in
troduced by Selden Sturges and was dis
cussed very widely before it was adopted.
It was at the suggestion of Horace Mann
that the meeting was held. The annuity
fund, which is contributed to by the
teachers of this city. Is diminishing and
the annuitants are increasing. To pre
vent the fund from becoming extinct. It
was suggested that each teacher who is
contributing to the fund pay an addi
tional ?1 for the next (wo years.
Many of the teachers went to the meet
ing opposed to such a course, but after
the lengthy discussion decided that it was
the only wa^to prevent the pension plan
from disappearing.
CONDITION OF FUND.
"Resolved, That It be the sense of the
teachers here assembled that we favor
the proposition to contribute $1 a month
extra for thirty months to the perma
nent fund for the teachers' annuity fund,
provided that 90 per cent of the con
tributors thereto shall signify their will
ingness so to do by signing an agreement
to that effect."

ALFRED STIti-MAJT.
Secretary Executive Committee.
THE Governor of Massachusetts, John L. Bates,
in his inaugural discussed the need of reform
in public accounting and especially separation
of the cost of public utilities from the general fund.
He said that a law to establish' uniform accounting
would not only greatly economize municipal admin
istration, but the separation of public utility accounts
would supply useful knowledge on the problem of
municipal industries, such as furnishing water, gas
and electricity.
Mr. Harvey S. Chase, Public Accountant and
Auditor of Boston, commenting on this, says:
"Herein the Governor touches upon a matter of most
vital importance, namely, the great question of mu
nicipal ownership of public utilities, around which
there is a surging and at times almost a raging tide
of public opinion. The two camps of supporters
and opposers of municipal management of public in
dustries, such as electric light works, gas works,
water, street railways and other businesses, are vio
lently antagonistic. Both quote figures in support
of their views and both are hopelessly confused by
thes>e same figures, for there is to-day in these indus
tries no uniform and comparative accounting and
reporting upon which such figures can be impartially
and authoritatively based. Think of the millions of
public money which may be hereafter voted for these
enterprises in our various municipalities and judge
if we do not need absolute accuracy in our financial
statements and an impartial and unassailable com
parison of these conditions and results before such
vast sums are expended."
These views are simply the repetition of all the
conclusions of experience in every American city
where municipal ownership of any public utility has
a history'- Making the cost independent of the plant
which it provides and supports has caused a confu
sion that none can untangle and an expense which
staggers belief. Moved by the forces of society, our
cities in California are pushing forward to the same
chaos, unless their people firmly insist that they
start right by resting the whole cost of a public plant
and every penny of the expense of its administration
upon the plant itself.
This separates it efficiently, in the beginning, from
the general fund, and keeps it separate, so that any
moment and all the time the people can know the
cost of the experiment they are trying. This will
put an end to that hopeless confusion which is upon
both the proponents and ppponents of municipal
ownership. It will equip the people for judgment in
voting public utility bonds. They can easily reduCe
any such proposition to exact figures, demonstrating
cost and benefit, and in no other way can they vote
intelligently upon the issue of the millions in bonds
which are now contemplated.
Under such a plan the people of Oakland, for il
lustration, can immediately compare the cost of an
existing and a proposed water supply. To deprive
them of this opportunity is asking them to take a
leap in the dark. Public authority owes it to the
people to give them full opportunity to judge intelli
gently when they arc asked to vote millions of their
property in taxes to enter upon a novel expedient
for the supply of a public necessity.

make necessary during fogs and general bathweather,
and for this reason we soon shall see some point in
Ireland the great entry port and shipping port for

In addition to the advantage which the Irish port
will have over any port in England or the Continent
as a distributing point for cargoes carried by the
monster steamships of the future, there will be the
further advantage of increased speed of transporta
tion. Mr. Shayne says: "I believe it will be possible
for a shipper in Scotland to send goods to Ireland
and from thence deliver them in Omaha in less time
than is required at present to send them from Liver
pool to New York."
It is, of course, quite probable that these promises
of courts, naval stations and cpmmerce are the ex
aggerations of oversanguine men, but the very fact
that there is "boom talk" in Ireland is sufficiently
strange to be notable. We have heard so much in
the past about Ireland's distressful condition that a
prediction of a twentieth century Ireland occupying
the commercial center of the globe is in itself a
change that marks a new era in the prospects of the
country.

Even the Shah of Persia is threatened with relig
ious difficulties which may culminate in fanatical
war. In these modern days of toleration some people
pay too much for their religion. This fact seems
particularly to be true in those countries where the
best of rcliginni is not good.
RECENTLY an Italian expert declared that
the efforts of the Department of Agriculture
to establish a silk industry in the South
would be futile because, as he said, the hands of the
negroes are too heavy ever to acquire the lightness
and deftness required to reel silk from the cocoons.
Incidentally he intimated that the objection would
be found to run against white as well as colored
women, and that in no part of the United States
would it be found possible to maintain a silk-pro
ducing industry in opposition to that of Italy, of
China and of Japan.
The opinion of any expert concerning his trade is
always interesting and instructive, but in this case
it appears the expert was not wise in his generation.
Almost at the time when the Italian silk grower was
a:serting the futility of our efforts at the production
of silk, Secretary Wilson was exhibiting in Washing
ton a hank of silk reeled by machinery and announc
ing that he proposes to teach the people of the South
how to use the machine instead of relying on hand
labor as formerly.
A report from Washington giving an account of
the exhibit and of Secretary Wilson's plans regard
ing the industry says: "There arc three of these ma
chines, though only one of them has been put in
operation, the intention being to send one of the
two remaining machines to Tuskegee and the other
to some place, where sufficient interest may be shown
to learn how to operate it. Cocoons have been pur
chased from all over the country and two expert fe
male French operatives have been brought to Wash
ington to teach the operation of the machines. It is
Secretary Wilson's desire to have the people of the
South, and especially negroes, learn the business, be
cause of -the comparative cheapness of that labor.
Arrangements have been made to have some girls
come to Washington to learn the machines."
It appears from this report that we need not trou
ble ourselves to question whether or no the Ameri
can woman â white or black â has a neat enough hand
and fingers nimble enough for reeling silk from co
coons. The work. can be done by machinery. That,
of course, means success for us, for when it comes to
handling machines we beat the world.

I THE MAN YOU LOVE.
w IT has been said repeatedly that any woman, who is not positively
B I deformed, can, with tact and delicacy, win any man she sets her heart
S A upon, but â can she? How many women have smilingly accepted
8 the compliment of the assertion in public, only to ponder the ques-
S ticn anxiously, oft times hopelessly, in the privacy of the boudoir.
13 What an old, old, problem it is. to be sure, but oh, how appallingly
g new to most of the Rentier sex who will read these lines. Matrimony
g the right man â a comfortable, happy home. It is the one srreat prob-
8 lem of a woman's life from the cradle to the prrave. They are the ideals
Â§ that women have always â¢cherished, always will. And how many, or
8 rather, how few, realize their ideals. '
S It is a problem that few men can understand, or, worst of all. ever
Â§ try to understand. Man. with his lordly assumption of all the orerojj-
g atives of life worth havine. may woo and win where and when he list-
* eth. But to woman â passive, receptive woman â what is civen? She
S must wait her lover's cominjr. She may not seek, as man do*es. that which
Â§ pleases her most. And out of the lovers who choose to woo she must
S make what poor selection is afforded her, and, burying the ideal, give all
S the fluttering, clinging hope of the future to shaping the real into
8 something akin to the eod of her dreams.
o And in this world of sham and show, of the mad chase for wealth.
" the problem has become vastly more vexatious than it ever was before.
S Even thoueh it has been long accepted as something akin to a ioke. it
o happen? all too often in real life that she loves the poor man. and must
S rhoose between him and a wealthier though less undesirable suitor.
q Perverse woman, sav the knowing and the worldly: but only the girl
o who has been confronted with such a problem can realize the heartburn-
S ing. the sublime emotional tragedy of it all. Whichever way she chooses
S some great part of the ideal is shattered andâ what then?
S Every woman who reads is seeking the answer to just such a ques-
S tion. JuÂ«t a few of those who write have tried to answer it for her.
8 Such a one is the "Half-Hour-Storiette" in the next Sunday Call, en-
q titled "When Jabberwock Rode." Curious title, isn't it? Well, it is a
g curious story, and one that answers the nroblem as â well, read it and
S see if you would answer it that way. If vou are a woman it is ten
Â« chances to one vou would or â would you? .
S Perhaps, after all. you wouldn't, for there is another storr that solves
S the riddle in a different wav. It is called "Betwixt Dad and Toe." but
Â« the problem before the girl is not exactlv what you would infer from
S that title â indeed not bv a great deal. Nor can you guess what man-
's ner of finesse Â«he used to brin* about a happy endingâ the only sort an
g srdent girl will ever accept. Still another is "Under the Car of the
Â« Juggernaut." but the eirl in this story did not have thing3 as much her
8 own way as you mieht think she Hid frcm such a title. Or doe* that
3 title convey as clear a concention of what a remarkable story this is
S as a well selected title should? You'll be able to decide that question
S best for yourself when vou read Â»1! the bright, clever, up-to-date stories
Q on the two "Half-Hour-Storiftte" pages in the next Sunday Call.
<5 Then, to be sure, there is the second installment of "Brewster's
Â£fc Millions" which jroes far. toward clearing the mystery of bow he
8 spent one mUlion a year to make six more. If-"you think it is the
S ""easiest thing in the world to spend a million a year, get your money's

with a sturdy kick and belted Canty upon
the head with a stout, high shouldered
bottle that had contained some of the
finest Dutch Rin that ever sailorman
smacked li?s ovar.
Then while the mate lay gruntine on
the deck the bellicose captain kicked him
in the eye and bit a piece of meat out
of hi* chest, but. not liking the flavor,
spit it out. Mate Canty gently swore
again that had not Second Mate A. Far
quhar and the ship's carpenter, L-. M.
Inderson, disarmed the captain Mate
Canty would have gone to Davy Jones'
There was the usual lack of unanimity
in the evidence. The captain and two
sailors judicially swore that Mate Canty
had hurled defiance at the captain and
had called him a lime juicing something
that would not look well In print. Then
the captain and the mate came together
and rol'.fd over and over on the deck of
the gallant bark Tobey in an unfriendly
embrace, swearing like pirates of tha
Spanish Main.

In discussing his future position as Min
ister to the Arcentlne republic, Mr. Bar
rett says, he will follow the same policy
as when he was Minister to Slam. He
will \n every way promote a demand for
all American products. He considers the
South American republics a splendid field
for increased commercial intercourse with
this country and he hopes that commer
cial bodies all over the United States will
recognize this fact and try to promote
closer trading relations.
Until March of this year Mr. Barrett
was commissioner general of foreign af

A large majority of the buildings are
now ready for the reception of exhibi
tions. The only possible delay so far is
in the completion of some of the foreign
and a few State buildings. The Russian*
French. German and Great Britain build
ings are being rapidly pushed forward
and the*- will be ready for the opening
day.
John Barrett, recently appointed United
States Minister to the Argentine repub

We have in mind the editorial utterances of
the Prospect of the past, and find nothing th*t
we would retract. We find nothing that rightly
understood can be taken as antagonistic to
the interests of labor, or even the labor unions,
when their operations are within the law. The
course of the Prospect hat always bÂ«en to
teach reepect for law and constituted authority.
Wn believe in the rights of labor and in the
rights of property, and we know that these
rights cannot bo secure except under the law.
â¢ â¢ â¢ We admit that the Prospect has
been friendly to capital. For twenty years we
have done our best to induce capital to come
to Calaveras. We Believe we. have done fully
as much to Induce capital to come to r this
county as has the Calaveras Miners' Union of
Angels. Why? Not because, we have received
any direct returns. from the capitalist* them
selves, but because capital has built up pros
perous communities all over the county. It
has given employment to thousands of men.
and by the expenditure of millions of dollars
has created happy homes for those that labor.
In these homes the Prospect is a regular visi
tor and our support comes f ron% those, who
labor and are paid for their labor by capital.
Take the capital out of Angels, MelonÂ«s, A1
tavllle, Hodson,* Owln Mine, Mokelumne Hill
and other places to-day and where would labor
bÂ«? Take a million dollars of capital out of
Angels to-day and there would be no boycott
against the Prospect, because there would be
no Calaveras Miners' Union No. 55 . to pro
claim a boycott. We are the friend of capital
because It is the friend of labor. We are the
friend of labor because It Is directly from that
a community. 1b built up. Neither can exist
without the other In a mining community. Â¦

The Calaveras Miners' Union of Angels
has boycotted the Calaveras Prospect and
a lively tilt is in progress because of this
act. In the declaration of the boycott a
committee of the Western Federation of
Miners sets forth that the Prospect has
tried "to defeat the object of organized
labor by creating dissension In the ranks
of unionism and promoting the Interests
of corporate greed at the expense of. the
toiling masses of this and other counties
in the State of California." The Prospect
replies to the various allegations in the
announcement that it is under the ban of
the miners by saying, in part: â¢

The Inyo Independent says this of ope
rations In Inyo County:
About half the force at the Valley View
mine was laid off the past week. This move
was made in obedience to instructions received
from the EaÂ«t to reduce the force at all the
company's mines, which waa betrun over a
month ago. Of the 250 men emtloyed two
months aÂ«o on the Mizpah, Burro and Valley
View only about one-half remain, the rest
having been "drafted." The mine* are all
opened now to such an extent that their
future is assured and the company has de
cided to go slow in development till the means
are at hand to reduce the ore. The properties
are all practically opened up to a depth of
800 feet and there is ore enough m sUht to
keep a mill in steady operation for a long
term of years. For months past the company
has endeavored to pay the working expenses
of the properties by the regular shipments of
ore. and while it has succeeded in doing this
it has been done at a srreat loes. To handle
this ore that has been ehipped to the smelters
has cost from $40 to $50 dollars per ton,
besides the loes occasioned by leakage, and
as from one thousand to fifteen hundred tons
were shipped monthly the loss can readily be
appreciated when it is understood that the ore
could be worked at an expense of hot ex
ceeding $10 per ton If reduced at home.
Our negotiations with Mr. Camptw.ll for the

the State Debris Commission shall grant us

such earth as must be removed before develop

application is now before the commission, at

a committee of the commission, accompanied
by an engineer, will examine the grounds and
report. If permission is granted we will re
turn to Marysville, pay for the property and
proceed at once to develon it.
The Lecompton mine in Nevada County
has started up with new machinery, in
cluding a ten-stamp mill.
Three hundred men are at work at the
Kennedy mine in Amador County. Twen

The Continental group of claims In the
White Mountains, Mono County, will be

Coal is reported to have been discovered

The South Bank mine on Indian Creek,
between Angels and San Andreas, is re

Superintendent Starr of the Empire

The statistics of mining in California in
the future will doubtless show a greater
annual output of asphalt and petroleum.
The oil mining industry is getting on a
solid business basis, in which all experi
mental questions having been determined,
the product is sure to increase. The ef
forts to market California asphalt are

The shipments by rail for various par
ties do not include the entire production,
as the railway companies own large
tracts of productive oil lands and they
are large consumers on their own ac
count: It is supposed that the petroleum
produced in California last year amount*
to between 16,000,000 and 17,000,000 barrels.
The gold product of California in 1902 will
show a falling off from 1901. Many other
products, which have been in the back
ground, are known to have turned out
in larger values in 1902 than In any pre
ceding year. Among these is rubble, a
mine product that is largely used.
While a bulletin on the quicksilver re
sources of California is about to be sent
by the State Mineralogist to the State
Printer for publication, some Interesting
information about quicksilver in the
United States, and especially in Califor
nia, is supplied by the United States Geo
logical Survey, the paper on the subject
being written by Dr. J. Struthers. Since
1850 California has furnished to the world
1,913,258 flasks of which the New Almaden
mine in Santa Clara County has given
up more than 50 per cent. The entire
United States produced In the year 1902
an amount- of 34.451 flasks of 76% pounds
each. The total value was $1,500,412. Cali
fornia in 1902 turned out 29,199 flasks, or
within 5000 flasks of the whole.

regulating the relations of the mine owner*
and employes, but in the suppression of free
speech and a free press. * * * Is this a
notice to the press that any paper that dares
to publish any article that does not pass the
ordeal of their censorship will fall under the
ban of their organization? Is this American
ism according to the standard of the Western
Federation? Wo believe the head officers of
that order, as soon as they find out what has
been done, will have sufficient sense to call
a halt on this over-zealous subordinate union.
We venture to say this unwise action will help
rather than injure the Prospect. It behooves
every right-minded citizen of Calaveras County
to uphold the freedom of the presa against this
unwarrantable assault. In behalf of the press
of the entire State the duty has been laid upon
the Prospect of carrying this matter into the
courts by a suit for damages or injunction
against the union. In the face of -such out
rages upon free Institutions it la high time
that unions were made to understand that the
American Government is- stronger than the
Western Federation â stronger to protect the
citizen In the wijoyment of his property than
any combination of men is to deprive him of
his rights.
Later it was announced that the dead
numbered twenty and the wounded
eighty, Including six officers. A captain
who was killed had his head cut oft and
an engine driver was burned alive. Both
engines* were destroyed and several of the
cars were crushed into splinters.
The transportation of the wounded was
a pitiful sight, women crying all along
the route. â¢
Darkness rendered the confusion about
the scene of the wreck extreme, while
terror was increased when the trains took
flre shortly afterward. Fortunately the
flames were immediately put out. Spe
ciall trains were hurriedly sent to the
scene, carrying the authorities from the
nearest town, who organized a corps of
physicians and aided the wounded.
King Victor Emmanuel visited the hos
pital in person later to see the victims of
the accident.
ROME, Aus- 28.â A disastrous railway
accident has cut short the festivities and
demonstrations in honor of the King and
Queen at Udine, the chief town on the
eastern frontier, sixty miles from Ven
ice, where the sovereigns had gone to
view the grand army maneuvers. At 10
o'clock last night, near Udine, a train
overflowing with soldiers collided with a
freight train. Fifteen soldiers and one
trainman were killed and more than
sixty injured, twelve dangerously so. The
colonel in command was among the lat
ter.

"Besides these games we will have the
Reliance team, which promises to be un
usually strong this year.
"The big game will be played In San
Francisco. By an agreement the two uni
versities decided to hold the contests on
the respective campuses after 1904, but I
doubt whether they will ever stick to it
It would cost $20,000 to put the Berkeley
grounds into shape and that would more
than. eat up the . profits .for one year."
James Whipple will coach the California
team this year. No one has b?en selected
to assist him in the work up to the pres
ent time." .-.:..,
A big hole was torn In the eleven that
went against Stanford last year, but there
are enough of the former team left to
make it Interesting. "Little Mini," "Ox"
Albcrtson and "Bob" Sherman will be
missed, but there will bo such familiar
faces as Ben Stroud, center; Reno Demer-
Itt, end; Samuel Stow, guard; Overall,
guard; Heine Heltmuller, tackle, and
Harry Howard, guard, to remind the en
thusiast of battles past and gone.
To fill in the gaps caused by the gradu
ation of the great guns of the football
fort there will be such players as Cogan,
Belknap, Gillls, who played on last year's
freshman team, Rlsley, Muther, Force,
More, Clark, Sabin, Mlddleton and Hud
son, who played last year, but did not
make the intercollegiate team.
"We look forward to having just as
good a team this year as last," said Man
ager Decoto yesterday. "There's enough
material to make two good teams. The
men will go Into training a little earlier
this year than usual. They will have more
practice, too, for we have games sched
uled with the University of Oregon and
the University of Nevada. Warren ("Lo
comotive") Smith Is coaching the Orego
nlans. When they come we will play them
on the Berkeley campus. )
about the team they will send
against Stanford University and the
other teams. California is, apparently, to
have a crackajack eleven this year. Grad

with all the tried material on hand It will
be an easy Job to overcome the cardinal
eleven. So also believes Captain "Ovie"

The handlcapper has been rather lib
eral, and if some of the poorer players do
not win it wlll.be their own fault. Miss
Anita Beyfuss on the "15" mark looks
dangerous. Miss Hunter and Miss Ed

mined by the Interstate Coursing
Club the eastern officials can arrange
their circuit meetings without further
delay.
They have been awaiting the action of
the Californlans to the end that the dates
of the big annual fixtures on the coursing
calendar would not conflict. While only a
small representation of greyhounds wiil
go from here to Waterloo and other
meetings, a large number of Eastern
hounds are expected to come to this
coast. P. J. Rcilly of this city has ac
cepted the invitation. to Judge throughout
the Eastern circuit. Efforts are also be
ing made to secure the services of James

been brought out easily.

In this department of the game.
From the interest displayed during the
week at the meetings of the Interstate
Club and the San Francisco Coursing
Club and from reports from the East it
is evident coursing is again on the up
grade. Greyhounds are In great demand,
the supply of running dogs being inade
quate at the present time to satisfy the
demands. There was a lull In breeding
for a time, the effect of which is now
being felt. With so many parks In ope
ration dogs which can win are much
sought after. I
At the last meeting of the California
Coursing Committee the members dis
cussed, informally, the matter of hold
ing a big plains meeting under the joint
auspices of the clubs throughout the
State. With their co-operation a large
purse could be raised and the meeting
would be a memorable one. A liberal bid
is expected from Fresno, where the meet
was held last year. The coursing men
believe this the best available place, as
the ground is gocd, hares are plentiful
and excellent hotel accommodations can
be secured. With the two clubs In this
city acting in conjunction with the Los
Angeles, Stockton, Fresno, San Jose and
Sacramento clubs, the former glories of
the plains meeting would be revived. The
meeting would De held after the first
heavy rainfall of the season, when the
ground would be at its best,,
One of the important matters to be de
cided at the forthcoming meeting of the
American Coursing Board will be the
election of the keeper of the stud book to
succeed George MacE. Malcolm, who has
filled the position for three years. Peer
Tiffany of this city, who succeeded Mr.
Malcolm as secretary of the California
Coursing Committe, is the most promi
nent candidate for the place. AH the rec
ords from which the book must be com
piled are In his ofllce and he Is thorough
ly familiar with the work. The election
will be held at Oklahoma City on the
night preceding the running of the Amer
ican Waterloo.
E. Preston has taken a string of grey
hounds to Los Angeles, including Miss
Brummel, Prompto, Flower of Gold,
Golden Garter, Royal Spirit, Bright For
tune and Real Pasha. , .
E. M. Kellogg - of Gilmore City. Iowa,
has shipped three greyhounds to J. C.
Jackson of this city. As he has been rep
resented here : by. great dogs in the past
much is expected of these.
Trainer "Sol" 8pencer, who was with
Frank McComb.and A. R. Curtis, has
gone to Texas to take charge of the ken
nel of Cecil Lyon. He will make the
rounds of the Eastern circuit and win
then bring the best of his string to this
coast.
Frank McComb has sold Otto and Firm
Fellow to George S. Perry.
The coursing at Union Park to-mor
row will commence upon the. arrival of
the 10:15 a. m. train. A 64-dog reserve
stake makes up the card. The likely win
ners look to be: .

The tournament committee which has
the events in charge is composed of W. B.
Collier Jr., S. C. Gayness, Homer Hotch
kiss, Alexander Beyfuss and Grant Smith.
R. N. Whitney will act as referee.
The entries will- close promptly at 4 p.
m. to-day, after which hour no name will
be received. Owing to the difficulty en
countered In the last tournament through
the carelesa methods of the committee the
rules will be adhered to strictly. The
drawings for all the events except the
mixed doubles will be held at the Califor
nia Club grounds this afternoon at 5
o'clock. Besides the challenge ; cups two
prizes will be offered for each event.
It is expected that few teams will enter
the men's doubles. ' MaeGavin and Smith
are considered : the most likely winners.
Probably the best match of the meet will
be between this team and Freeman and
Bell, the coast champions. Last year they
played a mosi exciting five-set match.
In singles there will be quite a large en
try, but good players will be rather
scarce. As in the doubles, the most likely
candidate^ for singles honors .- are v. Bell,
MaeGavin and Smith. MaeGavin is some
what off in his game,. due: to a rack of
practice. It Is expected he will get enough
playing before I the singles commence to
put him in good shape. Collier, Murdock
and Mitchell are also strong candidates
and will no doubt work well up-lnto ,the
tournament. Murdock has been practic
ing hard, and if at his best will -be a dan.
gerous competitor, v; -,
In the women's events the Suttons will
again carry off the honors. The strongest
local player is Miss Miriam Edwards, the
State champion, but she can hardly hope
to beat even; the poorest of the Suttons.
Miss Dobbins ;is the best player 'outside
of the famous; sisters, but she has never
been able to beat any o{ them, al though
The challenge match In men's doubles
will be played Saturday afternoon, and
the women's match Saturday morning.
The challenge matches In singles will be
played Wednesday, the 9th. The men's Is
set for the afternoon and the women's for
the morning.
The present champions who / will be
called upon to defend their titles are:
Lewis R. Freeman, men's singles; L. R.
Freeman and A. E. Bell, men's doubles;
Miss May Button, women's singles; Misses
May and Violet Button, women's doubles;
Mies Dobbins and A. E. Bell, mixed
doubles.
The opening event will be the men's
doubles, which will begin at 10:S0 o'clock
Monday morning. Tuesday the women's
singles will commence. Wednesday and
Thursday will be devoted to the men's
singles and Friday to the women's
doubles. N6 date has been fixed for the
mixed doubles. It will be played at the
convenience of the committee, the time to
be announced on the courts.
THE sixteenth annual tennis tourna
ment for the championship of the
coast will commence on Monday at
San Rafael. All of the prominent
players, as well as most of the lower
class men, will compete. .
s'o to the serious expense of having one
designed and built. In the 44-foot class
ti>e Corinthians have T. Jennings' sloop
i : peedwell, aralnst which the San Fran
cisco Club could set no worthy competi r
tor. Both these boats are comfortable
cruising yachts, with plenty of room for
sleeping and living purposes. The Corin
thians chose the sportsmanlike course of
challenging In the c'.ass In which the
trophy was taken from them. Whatever
the standing of the Corinthian with re
gard to the Macdonough cups may be,
she will at least furnish the yachtsmen
â¢with an lnterestine race and with mate
rial for much comment and discussion.

The Corinthian? feel the Perpetual cup
was won from them by a boat of a type
superior for racing purposes to any of
the boat* in the bay. and that the only
way to set the coveted trophy back is
10 build a racing machine. It would have
been quite simple for the Corinthians to
make almost certain of winning the cup
by challenging, with the sloop Harpoon,
designed by F. R. Cook, and which has
proved a fast sailer in many races. The
Ban Francisco Tacht Club has no boat
In the 56-foot class that would have any
cfc&nce 4rttb the Harpoon, and would not
J. M. Macdonough, the generous donor
cf the Macdonough cups for several years,
while recently in the city had a long
conversation on yachting matters with
A. M. Clay. He frankly expressed his
disapproval of the construction of such
craft aÂ« the Corinthian for use on x the
San Francisco Bay. and expressed a de-
Fire that che should not be permitted to
contend for his trophy in the 30-foot or
any other class. He does not think such
a craft is, wholesome, being a freak meant
merely for racing, and not a real boat.
To compare small things with great.
the Corinthians found themselves in
much the same position as Herreshoff
with regard to the America's cup race.
That great designer had expended all his
inventiveness and ingenuity on the Co
lumbia, which turned out so great a sue
t-ess that she was twice chosen to defend
the international trophy. It was hardly
possible for him to go further in - the
direction of designing a boat of the Co
lumMa type, and it would have been use
less Co build a second Columbia. In the
Reliance he etruck out in a new direc
tion and with brilliant results. Similarly,
the Corinthians dJd not care to build a
boat of Just the same type as the eloop
Challenger, which was designed ;by
Crownlnshield of Boston. It was almost
I'^cessary for them to construct a boat
on a different plan. The Corinthian, as
i-he will be named, is of an extreme type,
being a mere racine machine. She has
enormous overhangs fore and aft, a shal
low floor, great beam and no bowsprit.
Tit; deed of gift of the -Perpetual Chal
leÂ»,*e cup requires that the vessels con
tending fer the trophy shall be "cabin
yachts." Hfcfe is likely to arise a ques
tion as to Just what a "cabin yacht" is.
It naturally seems to mean a boat hav
ing adequate and somewhat comfortable
sleeping accommodation. The sloop Chal
lenger has a low deckhouse, but her cabin,
except that it docs not afford much head
room, actually furnishes accommodations
for four or five men. She has made sev
eral trips up the Sacramento River.
All the internal space of the sloop Chal
lenger is available for living purposes as
her finked is sustained by her hull. The
Corinthian, however, will not have a hull
capable of holding up her heavily weight
ed centerboard. which will be supported
by a ste*>'. truss. This truss was made
in the Eastern States and brought out
to San Francisco in pieces, to be put to
gether here. The strike among the steel
workers of the East caused several weeks'
delay in its arrival and really caused the
postponement of this year'B race for the
cup. When the truss is In place It will
cumber up the interior of the vacht so
there will be no accommodation for her
master and crew.
chor for the night. The San Fran
cisco and California clubs have nothing
on their schedules for to-nisht, but to
morrow the combined fleets of the three
clubs will cruise to the Heads and will
go outside for some distance. The tide
serves favorably for an ocean sail, al
though it is an event usually not much
liked by the owners of small yachts, as
the Ions swells are somewhat trying. â¢
As the deed of gift of the San Fran
cisco Perpetual Challenge cup requires
that the race for tne trophy takÂ© place
r.ot later than September 30 In any year,
and not sooner than thirty days after
the challenge has been received by the
holders. It is evident there will be no
cup race in these waters during the pres
ent season. Even if the new challenger
being buiit by the Corinthian Yacht Club
were ready to eail to-day the time for
tuning her up and getting her in trim
would be all too short. It is probable,
however, the race will take place about
midsummer of next year, when the winds
are strongest and truest.

dull and uninteresting. Probably the best
race was the third, a handicap at one and
one-eighth miles, and was won by Lou's
ville. Her fondness for the mud was well
known and the -books lost heavily by her
victory. The track was sloppy, the
weather rainy and the attendance small.
The track was cut off from the rest of
the world so far as telegraphic communi

of the Racing Association notified the tel
t graph companies this morning to discon
tinue their wire connections with the

want any report of the odds or running of

tenance.
DETALUMA, Aug. 28.-The third day
of the breeders' meeting at Kenll
| worth Park drew another 'fair sized
The chase was over a wild and ptcturesquo
country. On both Bides of the river the moun
tains rise precipitously, from a qiAxrter to a
half mile in height.- In many places the
growth of underbrush is so dense that the
hunter can only make his way through tho
tangle with great difficulty. In other places
the fir and pine trees grow to -great heights,
but the country is comparatively open. The
soil is so loose, however, that there is danger
of sliding from the mountain side to the bed
of the river, which is filled with huge boul
ders. In many places the bluffs are almost
perpendicular, and a single mlestep of the
hunter subjects him to the danger of being
dashed to death on the rocks far below. '
The bear led the hounds a wild chase, cross
ing the river three times and ascending to the
summits of the highest peaks in each range.
It is a conservative estimate to say the bear
and the dogs made a run of fifteen miles.
Bruin was so hard pressed that he took to
trees three times, long enough to rest, but
jumping cut before the hunters were close
enough to sight him. His last run was In the
shallow river for nearly a mile, after which he
took to a big fir tree, resting on a limb eixty
or seventy feet from the ground.
The hunting party, guided toy the baying of
the hounds, soon reached the spot. The tree
In which the bear took his last refuge was on
the mountain side, about ninety yards above
the river. When . we arrived he was growl
ing savagely, snapping his teeth viciously and
apparently preparing for a Jump. Guide Crab
tree and Professor Watson reserved their fire,
considerately giving me the privilege of the
first chance. The first shot, made under- the
stress of excitement and after a long run, was
probably a clean miss. On the second fire tho
ball went straight to the mark, striking the
bear Just back of the ear, inflicting a fatal
wound. As bruin leaped into the air Mr.
Crabtrea fired, the ball taking effect in the
shoulder. As soon as the bear struck the
ground the dogs were upon him. In the
fight that followed he lost his balance, rolling
down the mountain side a distance of more
than 200 feet - and : landing Â¦ in the river less
than fifteen feet from where we stood.
As he raised his bead after the fall I sent
another bullet crashing through his brain. His
big frame quivered convulsively for a. moment
or two. something that resembled steam poured
from the gunshot wounds, he gasped a few
times and rolled over dead.
It was a black bear, about fifteen years old.
These , do not attain a great size. Tlfls one
was probably large for his species and would
have weighed BOO pounds had. he been fat Tha
kill was made at 9 o'clock in the morning,' but
It was after sundown before we succeeded in
taking the bear into camp.. The next morning
Guide Crabtree brought bruin to . , Bartlett
Springs and. during the entire day. he. was an
object of extraordinary interest to all the
The bear hunt was arranged by Pro
fessor Watson and Guide Orln Crabtree
for Mr. Leake. Here is Mr. Leake's
story of their exciting adventure:
We left Bartlett Springs shortly before noon
on the 23d lnst., went first to the Crabtree
home, ten miles west, then to the top of the
mountains on the south bluff of Eel River,
making camp in a fern-covered glade shaded
by pine and fir trees. Deer were plentiful in
the vicinity of the camp, but we did not dis
turb them. We breakfasted at dawn and left
camp about 6 o'clock. Fifteen minutes later
and in less than half a mile from the spot
where we spent the night "Red Eye" picked
up a fresh bear trail.
A number have been killed, but
with this exception by professional hunt
ers and guides. Orln Crabtree, whose ser
vices Mr. Leake secured for the trip, had
previously killed two bears this season.
He lives on the headwaters of the north
fork of Cache Creek and Is so thoroughly
posted In regard to the country and such
an Industrious and reliable guide that
his services are In constant demand. He
has been engaged to pilot Harry Corbett
and a party of friends who are coming
up from San Francisco next week, thor
oughly equipped for a bear hunt. .
Mr. Crabtree is working Professor
George Watson's celebrated pack of Vir
ginia foxhounds j this season with great
success. Two of them are so well trained
that when taken into the mountains for
a bear hunt they pay no attention what
ever to any other trail. It is probable
that as "varmint" dogs their equals are
not to be found in the State. "Red Eye"
Is the older and more experienced dog,
but High Step is a rapid trailer, has a
keen nose and promises to become tho
premier bear dog of the State.
BARTLETT SPRINGS, Aug. 28.â To
Ed .E. Leake of Woodland has fall
en the honor of being the first
guest in the history of this famous
resort to bring a bear Into camp.

LOS ANGELES. Aug. 28.â Joe Corbett's
home run saved the Seraphs from a shutout
in this afternoon's game 'with Seattle. Car
rick, formerly a National Leaguer, was about
as good as anything In the way of a pitcher
seen here this season. Three hits, two singles
and a home run. were all the locals could get
off his puzzling curves. The visitors*' made
all their runs In the seventh inning. TTp to
that point there was no choice between Drink
water and Carrick, as far as effectiveness was
concerned. The local man lost hia cunning for
about five minutes and six hits netted five
runs. The fielding of both teams was perfect.

Peter Lohman used bad judgment- in the
eighth inning when he took the big slab?

Homer Hillebrand won the game for
the Cripples In the eighth Inning, when
he drove in a run with a timely hit to
right. A few minutes later he trotted
in from left field and changed his clothes.
He said good-by to Uncle Peter and the
rest of the boys and at once departed with
brother Arthur for dear old Princeton,
and the fans will see the little favorite
no more. He will be missed, for in the
three games played here he had won the
hearts of the fans by his good work in
the field and at the bat.
Up to the fifth inning the natives could
not get at all familiar with the goods of
Johnson. Then they managed to soak him
for a pair, and an error helped them out
and gave them a run. They made a few
more, and so did the Cripples, so the
score was a tie, 4 to 4, when the tenth
spasm opened.
The Cripples failed to land, but Graham
immediately passed Meany and Irwin.
Pabst was not wanting, for he lined the
leather out to left field and brought in
Meany and ended it all. The score:

The little companions of her daughter
were Lois' older sister, Ruth, and James
Davis, a boy of 4 years. *. f
Mrs. Foyle hardly realized for a few
minutes how close had been the call and
how brave had been the rescue 1 of her
baby. When the facts dawned upon her
bewildered mind she became hysterical.
"I hardly knew what to do or say,"
Mrs. Foyle explained to-day. "After I
recovered my composure I made Inquiries
and discovered that people who saw the
boy's brave deed declared It- was' done
with great coolness and heroism."
Mrs. Foyle visited the sick boy at his
home to-day.
So modest was young Loewen about his
act that for two days the baby's mother,
Mrs. J. H. Foyle, residing at the Oak
Lawn, Eighth and Castro streets, was un
able to learn the Identity of her child's
rescuer. Now thajt It has been disclosed
she has taken means to suitably acknowl
edge her appreciation.
The lad, who is an errand boy for
Charles J. Heeseman, Is the son of Mrs.
E. T. Loewen. a music teacher, residing
at East Sixteenth street and Twenty-third
avenue, and Is a grandson of the Rev. M.
Ongerth, a German reader at the Univer
sity of California. Since the episode
Thursday morning young Loewen has
been ill at home from the effects of his
efforts. '
Here Is his story of the rescue:
I was riding up Seventh street on my wheel
when I saw the up train stop at the Market
street station. I noticed the child on the
track as I wheeled along, but paid no atten
tion to her until I heard the train behind me.
The baby was at the crossing of Castro street
and the engine was then at West street, about
two blocks away. There were two other chil
dren near the baby and they were yelling
to her to come off the track, but the little
girl seemed too frightened to move. Â¦
I was then a block away at Brush street,
but 1 sprinted on my wheel, and beat the
train long enough to get alongside of the
baby, jump oil and grab her and jump back
just as the engine whizzed by. I was eo close
that I felt the engine cylinder brush my coat.
I had dropped my bicycle so close to the
track that I thought it had been smashed, but
It escaped.
The train rushed on and I didn't even hear
the whistle blow. I guess we ( were so cl6se
under the pilot that the engineer did not see
us. After that I carried the baby to her home.
She was not hurt a bit. Then I went to the
store. ' . .

years of age, at Seventh and Castro
streets. The boy grabbed the helpless
baby off the track just as the engine
passed so close that the cylinder grazed
the heroic youth's coat. Men who wit
nessed the daring rescue declared that
It was the record breaker, for life-saving
under strenuous circumstances.

to the Oakland Receiving Hospital. Dr.
William S. Porter, with Dr. O. D. Ham
lin. Dr. R. T. Stratton and Drs. Kelly and
Emerson, took charge of the case. They
found the lower limbs paralyzed and a
severe dislocation of the spine, with a
fracture at the dorsal vertebrae.
Anesthetics were administered and the
surgeons placed the body in a plaster
cast. If Hearther recovers he will be
kept In the cast for at least two months.
Because of his excellent physical condi
tion the surgeons are hopeful that their
patient will pull through, despite his
broken back. Hearther is an athlete and
a strong, sturdy young man. As a wheel
man he holds records for riding at Reno
and his five-mile relay, run In 12 minutes
SO seconds at Sacramento, is the fastest
time on record for that track. His Ne
vada time for the same distance is 12
minutes 37 seconds. Hearther resides at
1216 Nineteenth avenue, East Oakland.
He is known among wheelmen on the
coast as "the Flying Dutchman."
FOSTER FETE
WILL ATTRACT
i A GATHERING
The merry war among the students of
the Wllmerding and Lick High schools,
which was started about ten days ago,
when the rival students took turns In
raictiiig each cither's class numbers off
the top cf Twin Peaks, was renewed yes-
U rday with additional vim and vigor.
The Lick boys made a dash at their op
ponents at the noon hour and for a time
a lively rush was at its height.
The Lick boys, about 200 strong,' march
ed to the Wilmerding School grounds and
demanded the return of several hats that
had been captured by the latter a few
days before. The demand was received
with jeers and at once the Lick students
began to make a real "rough house."
The opposing factions battled fiercely for
a few minutes and the Wilmerding boys
added fifteen more hats to their credit,
while their opponents captured two.
The rush came to a 6udden standstill a
few minutes later when the bells of the
two schools began to toll In a vigorous
manner, summoning the warring students
back to their own grounds.

Since the big robbery of gold last Mon
day night every road leading from the
camp has been carefully guarded so that
the gold could not possibly be shipped out
of the country. Finally the police ob
tained news of where one of the sacks
was and in this way the party was
traced. The officers declare that: there
are at least five other men In the sang,
and it is supposed by outsiders tbu.t ono
of these peached on his comradefi. Then
a spotted dog, known to be the Â¦property
of Hughes, was seen with several men on
a ridge near the scene of the big rol*
bery, so that the identification is now .
fairly complete.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Aug. 28.â A spe
cial from Atlin says that three miners
of Atlin, all well known men and all citi
zens of the United States, were arrested
to-day and charged with the theft of $20.
000 from the sluice boxes of the Atlin Gold
Mining Company last Monday night. The
prisoners are Bernard Hughes, formerly
proprietor of a hotel in Dawson; Joe
Dixon and James Jennings. They were
arrested in different parts of town by
mounted police officials. Hughes was
staying at a first-class hotel and his ar
rest caused great excitement. It was given
out to-night that a sack containing $4000
worth of nuggets had been found In the
room of one of the men. Dixon wanted
to make a fight when arrested and drew
a revolver. Hughes, it is said, partly con
fessed.

MARTIN KELLOGG
BORNE TO GRAVE
In the second paragraph of Lloyd's will
the following bequests are made: "I
give and bequeath to Matilda Buttner of
Sunol the sum of $500; to Loie Helen Wil
kinson of Los Angeles $500; to Elizabeth
M. Nix of Oakland, wife of Samuel Nix,
the sum of $5000; and to her mother the
sum of $1000, if she survive me, otherwise
said $1000 shall go to the said Elizabeth M.
Nix."
The remainder of his estate is left in
trust for ten years, the income to be
divided." one-third to his wife and the
other two-thirds to be divided between
Charles R., Mabel F., and Ethel Mary
Lloyd. The fourth paragraph of the will
Is as follows: "I make, no provision In
this my will for my son Frederick W.
Lloyd."
In the petition for the probate of the
will drawn by Attorneys Goodfellow and
Eells for Mrs. Lloyd, they state that
Charles R. Lloyd, son of the deceased,
resides at Fort Monroe, State of Vir
ginia; Mabel F. Lloyd, daughter of de
censed, resides in London, England, and
Ethel Mary Lloyd, a daughter of de
ceased, resides In Alameda County. Fred
erick W. Lloyd, the contestant. Is said to
be a resident of San Bernardino County.
Attorneys Waters and Wylle of Los An
geles represent Frederick Wv Lloyd, and
end their complaint in the suit brought
by them with the request that the will
of June 19. 1&03, be refused probate.
Mrs. Charles R. Lloyd, the widow, Is
ill at her home in Berkeley and when an
attempt was made to interview her to
day friends stated that she was In bed
and too HI to be seen.
Frederick Lloyd alleges" that they knew
that he was averse to the habits Indulged
in by his father and that for this reason
they conceived a dislike to him and
represented to his father that "he
had conspired with William Boxall
to cause him to shoot and kill Charles R.
Lloyd, and had conspired with Boxall to
accuse him of the crime of being the
cause of the downfall of his niece, Mar
garet Boxall."
In reference to this paragraph Mary
Lloyd and Helen Wilkinson say "that
they have no information or belief upon
the subject sufficient to enable'" them to
answer the same." But they believe they
are false on the ground that all the other
statements are false.
In his complaint Lloyd alleges that his
father made consorts, in his own house,
of Loie Helen Wilkinson and Various
other women and that by "reason of her
knowledge of the said conduct of Lloyd,
the said Wilkinson became possessed of
controlling influence over him which 6he
maintained till his death."
In reference' to Mary Lloyd he says:
"Upon the marriage of decedent to his
second wife, Mary Lloyd, she entered the
household with full knowledge of the
habits of Lloyd, and thereafter both she
and the said Wilkinson had common
knowledge of such conduct, and that both
of them thereby became possessed of a
control and influence over him which they
continued to exercise until hl3 death."
The answer and complaint make an
issue squarely on the truth or falsity of
all kinds of rumors surrounding the
shooting of Lloyd by his nephew, William
Boxall, at San Bernardino last January,
and charged by Lloyd in his complaint
as being true. To make a /showing be
fore the court Lloyd will have to drag the
family skeleton from its closet and ex
hibit It in all its hideousness.
An answer was promptly filed this morn
ing to the charges made by Frederick W.
Lloyd In the contest begun by him over
the probating of the will of the late cap
italist Charles It. Lloyd of Berkeley by
Loie Helen Wilkinson, 'the deceased capi
talist's housekeeper, and Mary Lloyd, his
wife. They, deny every allegation jmade
by young Lloyd. The matter .came up In
Judge Hall's department this morning and
the date of hearing the contest was set
for October G. ,"-Â¦';} ''Â¦ Â¦">,;'Â£

STOCK MARKET.
WHEAT â The market is in good shape all
over the United States. Chicago reports the
demand first class everywhere. Large local in
terests there are apparently absorbing Wheat,
and the demand for Flour Is urgent. Minne
r.poliB wires that millers are hunting up the
cash Wheat m*n and taking all they will sell
to crrive on the quiet. St. Louis reports ad
vices of serious, damage to Winter Wheat in
Kansas and Nebraska. The exports from tho
country for the week. Flour included, were
3,245,000 bushels.
Futures here were lower, but cash grain

LOCAL MARKETS.
The fruit market was liberally supplied with
poor stock, which moved off slowly. As usual
on Friday the local demand waa rather light
and there was little or no inquiry for ship
ping. Stocks of Apples were heavy and the
top quotation was en extreme figure for the
very best Gravenstelns In 4-tler boxes. Plums
and Prunes In small packages were in tret
supply and easy. Choice lots in bulk sold
readily for canning purposes at the previously
quoted rates. Bartlett Pears were steady and
good hard stock suitably packed was in de
mand for shipment. A carload of fancy stock
arrived from Cofoma and met with a steady
demand nt the maximum quotation. There
was no canning stock on .the market. Fine
Peaches from the mountain districts continued
to bring high prices and offerings from other
sections were in fair request at steady rates.
Carriers continued to sell at a wide range as
to 1 quality. The .canners were liberal pur
chasers of clingstones in bulk, and sales were
reported in a small way at $30 per ton. Figs
and Nectarines were offering freely and moved
off well. Quinces and Pomegranates sold slowly,
although offered nt reasonable figures. The
cool cloudy weather had a depressing effect
on the market for Watermelons, but as stocks
were lltht prices were unchanged. Receipts
of Melons and Cantaloupes were light, but car
ried-ovcr stock was abundant and there was
no lmnrovcment in prices. Grapes moved
slowly but fancy offerings In crates were
firmly 'held in anticipation of a good demand
for shipment on the Puget Sound steamer out
Â°CUrus fruits were unchanged and dull owing
to the cool weather. A steamer arrived from
Mexican DOrts with 370 cases Limes, which
had not been marketed up to a late hour. Ripo
Bananas were in somewhat limited supply and

Â¦ The only feature of interest In Batter at
present Is the almost complete disappearance
of dairy descriptions. It seems that the re
ceipts from dairies are steadily decreasing
year after year, as the dairies are generally
selling tv>elr cream to the creameries, and the
prediction is made that in several years more
dairy Butter will no longer be quoted. Even
now tho quantity coming in is so insignificant
as to hardly warrant quotations. It is dull
and weak.

The market was 'well supplied and continued
easy. Receipts were liberal and Included 1620
bags of Salinas Burbanks, which were selling
at easier prices. There was a limited demand
fcr choice river Burbanks for j shipping, but
supplies exceeded requirements and prices were
unchanged. Sweets Â£ were easy at unchanged
rates. A carload came in from Merced and re
ceipts from Stockton were liberal. Onions con
tinued weak, with the demand light and sup
plies plentiful.
There were heavy receipts of Tomatoes from
the river and across the bay and prices had a
further decline. Tho demand was fair, but
there was a heavy surplus unsold at the close.
The canners secured several hundred boxes of
the bay article on the preceding day at 30c per

Advices at 2 p. m. show that the bandits
eluded the posse in pursuit and passed
on through the thick brush territory to
ward the Maple Hill bridge.
At 1 o'clock this afternoon the report
comes from Paxaco that Sheriff Frey and
Chief Custy of the Rock Island detective
force, aided by four county deputies, have
the robbers located in a stretch oZ tim
ber near Paxaco.

train No. tt, Which had just palled in, and
Night Baggageman ! Charles Telsr saw
them and hurriedly attempted to block
the door, but tha robbers forced an en
trance and. after taking their roonoy and
watches, beat the men into Insensibility.
They then rifled the depot ef Its contents
and, going hurriedly to the eating-house,
held up and took all the valuables' from a
half-dozen men on the platform employed
at the roundhouse and a part of the train
crew. Passengers at the lunch counter
scurried upstairs and blocked the 'en
trance effectively. The bandits then loot
ed the eating-house register and silver
ware, doing their work in & cool and col
lected fashion after the manner of vet
erans, iv ---"-Â¦.- â¢Â¦â¢Â¦.'!
Then, apparently aa a Jofte, they
marched and carried six of the Bock
Island employes, Including the night hos
tler and baggageman, and locked them In
a refrigerator car and disappeared In an
easterly direction. . Â¦
During the thirty minutes of their presÂ»
ence not a shot was fired and only Mon
nehan and Toler were injured.
Two hours after the robbers disappeared
Sheriff. Frey had organized a posse, re
leased the prisoners from the refrigerator
car 'and galloped in pursuit. The bandits
were headed toward Topeka. - .
The bandits secured eight watches and
probably $150. They left McFarland on
foot. : v
Carrie, Pfeiffer Stuhr, the one-time
Tivoll favorite, was awarded $50 a month
alimony pending the trial of her suit for
divorce. Thcawa.rd.was made by Judge

from James A. Jones, a bicycle dealer,
until her suit for divorce is terminated.
Judge Graham issued the order. * '%'
Â¦ A suit for divorce was filed by Mary
Grace Terry against Frank . Terry for
neglect.
Annie McCarthy, a very pretty little
woman, appeared before Judge Graham
yesterday in quest of freedom from the
marital yoke .that bound her to William
McCarthy. â¢* With tears In her eyes she
told the court that McCarthy, ever since
their marriage two months ago, had
treated her In such a brutal and fiendish
manner that she had become a nervous
wreck. 'Her evidence was Â¦ corroborated
by that of several friends, and Judge
Graham granted her prayer for divorce.
McCarthy Is property man at the Orr
pheum.
I Judge Graham also granted Josephine
L. Libbey a divorce from Albert. H. Llb
bey for cruelty. Annie M. King was
granted a divorce from James King by
Judge 'Kerrigan. King treated her bru
tally, on one occasion breaking one of
jher ribs with a kick. Judge Kerrigan

divorce from Joseph Michl for failure to
provide.

ground of extreme cruelty from James Q.
Grannis of the manufacturing firm of J.
Q. Grannla &. Co., is dissatisfied with

BIG RECEPTION COMMITTEE.
The reception committee is a great one,
embracing a large representation of San
Francisco and interior banks of Califor
nia and also the official boards of control
of commercial organizations in this and
other cities, all of which united in the
Invitation that was cordially extended to
the bankers when. they were convened at
New Orleans. The members of the re
ception committee and the institutions
represented by. them are as follows:
Miss Snowgrass. who is only a little
over 30 years of ago. Is a granddaughter
of the late Judge O. C. Pratt, who, when
he died several years ago. left a large
fortune in realty. The estate was the
cause of long years of litigation. In which
the children of one of his daughters, who
was twice married, and who borÂ© children
by each husband, took part.
A petition to be appointed guardian of
Miss Jennie M. Snowgrass was filed yester
day by her half-brother, Orville C. P.
Goodspeed. The petitioner states that the
respondent Is not fitted to manage her
property, a statement affirmed by Miss
Snowgrass.
As another reason for the proceedings
It is stated In the petition that because
of the respondent's Inability, due to ill
health, it is feared that certain designing
persons have planned to take advantage
of her.
Consents to the Appointment of Her
Half -Brother as Her
Guardian.

MISS SNOWGRASS ADMITS
INABILITY TO: MANAGE
Not even his most intimate friends were
taken into his confidence during the hur
ried arrangements for his departure and
the first intimation they received of his
voyage was through hla farewell let
ters, which reached them when the Gan
tock Rock was far out to sea.
Charles Bishop is one of the best known
members of the younger social set of the
city and although a bit wild and inclined
to ignore the more serious phases of life,
he bore a splendid reputation among the
hundreds who enjoyed his acquaintance
ship and his association during the days
which he wasted in pleasure seeking in
stead of applying himself to duties that
would insure him a future place in the
local commercial world, in which his
father and multi-millionaire uncle are re
garded as important factors.
FAREWELL TO FRIENDS.
The Gantock Rock will go first to Puget
Sound and from there she will carry a
cargo to Natal. South Africa, thence to
Sydney and from there her master ex
pects, within the period of ten months,
to dock his old ship in the harbor of Liv
erpool. For this long and tedious voyage
young Bishop, in the menial capacity of
cabin boy will, as his shipping articles
show, receive three pounds sterling a
month or thirty pounds, all In gold, at
the conclusion of his service in Liverpool.
When hÂ« was brought before Captain
Crosbie for inspection on Monday, the
master offered his wealthy young appren
tice the customary advance of three
pounds, which Bishop modestly declined
with the statement that he would like to
receive all his earnings at the end of his
voyage.
But Bishop's mind was determined, arid
with his newly purchased sallor'g kit, of
which his aprons and his blankets were
the bulkiest part, he was shipped aboard
the Gantock Rock on Monday afternoon.
"When his father learned that his son was
in earnest a feeling of relenting came
over him and he exerted a mighty effort
to recall young Bishop to the family
home, but it was too late. To return
would mean desertion, and having fully
made up his mind to begin life over the
son refused to accept suggestion of re
conciliation from his father and turned
his face to the ship's mast.
RELENTS TOO LATE.
Cabin boy for a man who has passed
his twenty-fifth year and has been ac
customed to the services of the best res
taurants and the comforts that are easily
acquired with wealth is not a particu
larly inviting billet. To rise before the
sun, don an apron. Join the ship's cook
in the galley and carry greasy vltuala to
a hungry gang of sailors and meals to
the captain and his mates are only part
of the dally routine of the cabin, boy and
are followed between messes by attend
ance in the captain's cabin and finally
a restless night on a dirty bunk in the
foul air of the ship's forecastle.
and had never known what it Is to toll
and they were deeply impressed upon his
mind when he left his father. During
the hours of the following night young
Bishop, isolated from his accustomed en
joyments behind the locked door of his
apartments In the Hotel Savor, seriously
pondered . over the past and looked dis
mally Into the future. Sunday morning
found him a changed man, upon whose
countenance could easily be discerned a
look of determination that bode achieve
ments never before considered by him.
That day he informed his father that he
had decided to so to sea, and early Mon
day saw Charles mingling among a lot
of rough looking sailors In the British
consulate, awaiting his turn to sign away
his freedom. Through the Influence of a
friendly shipping master Bishop had se
cured the guaranty of a position as cabin
boy aboard the British Iron ship Gantock
Rock, and fully primed with knowledge
of the hardships that were before him
he hastened to enter upon the duties of
his new lot.
They were stinging words for the young
man, who had been raised amid luxuries
Young Bishop became a member of the
Gantock Rock's crew by enforced prefer
ence; that is, he had been given the al
ternative gf going to work on a farm
or serving an apprenticeship at sea. As
a penalty for his son's apparent indiffer
ence to the future, his riotous way of
living and recklessness in the expenditure
of money furnished him by his father,
the latter called Charles Into his presence
last Saturday and. according to the young
man's own version of the affair, sternly
informed his son that the end of pater
nal Indulgence and toleration had been
reached, and that thenceforth Charles
should expect no assistance from his fath
er in a financial way or look to the latter
for parental consideration of any favor
able character," except under conditions
there named by the senior Bishop.
"Go to work on a ranch or embark In
service on the sea," the father is said
to have remarked to his son, "and In
that wav show me tnat you have the
courage to provide for yourself and I will
relent. Give me some evidence that you
have an appreciation for future respon
sibilities and I will undertake again to
encourage you in. life."
WORDS HAVE A STINO.
It will be months before the young man
will again set foot. In San Francisco, un
less he should grow desperate in his new
and somewhat humiliating position and
desert the ship, and this Is not likely, for
in affixing his signature to the ship's
articles on Monday last at the British
consulate the Vice Consul was careful to
remind the amateur sailor of the severe
penalties imposed under the British mari
time laws upon, those who attempt to
break their contract with a ship master,
EMBARKS AS CABIN BOY.
The Gantock Rock, commanded by Cap
tain , Crosbie, was towed out of the har
bor early Tuesday morning with, a cargo
of lumber, destined for the Sound. Her
departure, in so far as the local j ship
ping world was concerned, attracted no
particular attention. But to one individ
ual, Ira Bishop, local representative of
the Jupiter Steel Company and a brother
of Charles R. Bishop, vice president of
the California Bank, the going of the
ship was an impressive incident, for
aboard her was s his only son, practically
banished from home, and bound by rigid
ship articles to serve ten months as cabin
boy aboard the Gantock Rock.
There was no one at the docks to say
farewell to young Bishop, for as a matter
of fact he went aboard the ship as she
lay In thÂ« stream the previous day and
no message from home reached him as
the Gantock/ Rock heaved her anchors
and made fast to the towboat line pre
liminary to starting on her long voyage.
Just before sailing, however, Bishop dis
patched several letters to his chums in
the city, bidding them adieu.
The, SDectacle of a California million
aire's son serving fodder to a sailors'
mess and packing meals to the master of
the ship is not one that San Francisco
society Is likely to contemplate with
pleasure, yet it is one that would prob
ably be witnessed on the good old Brit
ish ship Gantock Rock were the oppor
tunity afforded the members of local so
ciety to look down on that vessel as she
bucks' the billows on her way to Puget
Sound.
On the trip to the city the girl refused
to speak to any one and showed In her
maniyfr that she resented being found.
Miss "Wolfskin's mother, whollveslnLos
Angeles, Is at present staying at the Bella
Vista Hotel. Senator W. C. Ralston is
related to the young girl.
After wandering aimlessly around the
hills near Colma for forty-four hours
Miss Edith Wolfskill, the demented young"
woman who made her escape from the
California General Hospital, was found
by a Pinkerton detective' yesterday about
noon and taken back to the hospital
at once. Her clothes were badly torn
from walking through the thick brush,
but otherwise she was none the worse for
her experience.
The moment that the girl disappeared
from the hospital at Eighteenth and
Douglass streets a search was instituted
for her. Her relatives, besides notifying
Chief Wittman. employed Pinkerton de
tectives. One of these detectives, under
instructions from Captain Kemble, who
Is in charge of the Pinkerton office in
this citv, hired a conveyance and drove
down to colma yesterday. On Thursday
the young woman had been reported to
have been seen near Mussel Rock and
the man was told to make a thorough
search in this neighborhood.
Abandoning his carriage, near San Pe
dro Point, the detective climbed a high
hill and caught sight of the young wom
an at the bottom of a deep canyon. She
was kneeling and did not appreciate her
danger. With difficulty the detective de
scended the steeD sides of the canyon
and by the exercise of great strength
succeeded in dragging the girl up to the
level ground.
The carriage was then signaled for, but
Miss Wolfskill when it arrived refused to
ride in it. She was at last persuaded to
enter the carriage and she -was driven to
Colma kneeling on the floor of the ve
hicle. At Colma the detective notified
the Pinkerton office in this city that he
had secured the girl, and he was in
structed to taKe her back to the sanita
rium.
