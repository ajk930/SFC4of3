Mr. Boosevelt Returns to Washing

\ Vacation.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2S.-After an ab
sence of thirteen weeks, spent at Oyster
Bay, President Roosevelt returned to
Washington to-day. His special train ar
rived at 4 o'clock this afternoon. The
President was accompanied by Mrs.
Roosevelt, Miss Alice Roosevelt and other
members of the family and by Private
Secretary Loeb. The President was greet
ed by several hundred persons, who cheer
ed when he entered his carriage. He also
was met by Postmaster General Payne,
Colonel Symons, Superintendent of Pub
lic Buildings and grounds; Chief Wilkie
and other public officials. The President
and family drove direct to the White
House. The trip from New York was un
eventful.
A newspaper man asked the President
to-day if he had enjoyed his vacation.
He replied: \
"I did. I had a bully time and I never
felt better in my life. I am now ready
for thirteen months more of hard work."
out the day. Is very grave. No reinforce
ments of militia have arrived from out
side, and the only defense against the
mob, which grows hourly, is a more or
less demoralized police department and a
small company of militiamen.
An assault upon the office building of
the company by the mob early this after
noon, before the arrival on the grounds
of troops, was successful, and a mass of
frenzied rioters obtained possession of the
ground floor of the building, destroying
everything movable that came in their
path. A crowd of the office staff with
drawn revolvers prevented their gaining
access to the upper floors of the building.
Every window and door in the building
was smashed in. f ?Â»Â£â¢>\u25a0' A
The arrival of troops on the ground
armed with ball cartridges at about 2
o'clock served to restore some semblance
of order. The rioters then contented
themselves 'with throwing stones at the
building - and hurling Invectives at the
soldiers, who established a "dead line"
and prevented any approach toward the
building by any of the' rioters.
DRINK INFLAMES RIOTERS.
The majority of the mob are ignorant
Italians, Finns, Norwegians and French
men, the latter perhaps the hardest of all
to handle. All have been drinking more
or less, although the bars this afternoon
obeyed the order to close. The mob Is
one that cannot be reasoned with, and
the man they seem most anxious to get at
is Assistant Manager Coyne, who in 'the
absence of Shields is In charge of the
works. Coyne has discreetly kept out of
sight all day.
Late this afternoon the leaders of the
mob held a conference and demanded that
the company house the men in its hotel
and boarding-house and feed them until
the money for their wages la forthcom
ing. In order to appease the crowd this
demand was - granted, and the men have
taken possession of the "NVhlte House, a
large boarding-house operated by the
company. Provisions are being sent there
to feed them.

NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â Lawyers with
backing of builders and employers repre
senting 510,000,000 or more in New : York
City are working on a bill to be intro
duced in the Legislature next winter
which will seek to destroy the power of
walking delegates and make labor strikes
impossible. In brief, it is proposed to do
through State enactment what Is now
frequently done by injunction. Individ
uals \u25a0 or corporations may be restrained
from acts injurious to the pubjlc good,
and it Is held that a State law having
the same purpose will be â¢ constitutional.
Such a law as this exists in Australia,
and similar acts have been enforced in
England.' J. Powers Donellan has been
at work on the bill for some time. r
"We expect," he said, "that the meas
ure will have the support of the better
element of the unions, as well as the
backing of a large army of employers.
Such a law would be perfectly , feasible
and constitutional. It will make It illegal
for the walking delegate of a union j to
order a strike, and will provide for a
State board of arbitration for the adjust
ment of all disputes."
"But is not a law that seeks to restrain
the orderly acts o{ a union or an indi
vidual in the nature of interference with
personal liberty, and therefore unconstitu
tional?" was asked.
"The ordering of a strike," he replied,
"is not an orderly act, inasmuch as it is
antagonistic to the public welfare."
"Do you believe that It will be possible
to get sucn a '.bill through the Legisla
ture against the opposition of organized
labor?"
"Under thÂ© present conditions, yes. It
would not have been possible in the past,
but the disasters and evils of strikes
have been so painfully impressed upon the
people of this State recently that I be
lleve such a measure will receive suffi
cient support to make it a law."
The proposed law also will make it ille
gal for an employer to lock out his work
men. Donellan said ; the bill, would not
seek to make a strike a conspiracy. Ef
forts to prohibit strikes on this ground
have failed in the past, the court usually
holding that the men had a right to quit
work if they ; chose to do so. '

He also denied all knowledge of the re
cent report that he Is himself slated for
a position in the Cabinet and then turned
the discussion on to the recent charges
made by the British War Commission
against the methods pursued by the War
Department in the South African war.
As to tho commission's criticism he said:
APPROVES ARMY CENSURE.
Lord Lonsdale stated that he had rea
son to believe that the new federation in
the colonies would prove a success. Asked
for an expression of opinion regarding
the report of the possible succession of
Lord Milner to the position of Colonial
Secretary, he said his only information
came through the press dispatches, but
he doubted if Lord Milner would accept,
although he would be a splendid man for
the place.
Regarding his reported statement that
some day the colony would draw away
from the mother country, Lord Lonsdale
emphatically denied that he had ever
made any such prediction and he added:
"I traveled all over the colony and
spoke to all classes of her people, but
never did I hear^ho slightest Intimation
of any such move and I have never
thought. of it. On the contrary the people
to me seemed to be deeply ; concerned in
the affairs of the mother country and de
lighted in hearing anything new, a fact
that would suggest that they are not de
liberating over plans for a separation."
"There is also too much salary dis
pensed in Australia to Its officials. States
men receive a certain amount for repre
senting the districts which send them, to
the legislative halls and they are paid an
extra fee for services as members of spe
cial committees. As a result certain men
are forever struggling to get these partic
ular places. Their interests In affairs of
their constituents diminish before their
avarice. I believe that a man who is
willing to represent his people in the fur
therance of legislation that Is of common
benefit should do so without a stipend. I
think a man who is honestly interested in
the welfare of h'.s own people will do so
without asking pay."
Lord Lonsdale added that he thought
that the paying of salaries to legislators
had a tendency to make them dishonest,
and when it was suggested to him that
American statesmen, that is. Senators and
Congressmen, receive a regular salary, he
quickly replied with a smile on his face:
"I know, I know. But I am not quite
sure that this custom is at all times in
the best interest of the States. How
ever, it is not fair to compare your States
with those of the colonies, for they are
not on the same footing."

tice law of the colony, which bars a
father from teaching his own son a trade.
It is frequently the case that a man seeks
to perpetuate a business which he has de
veloped after long years of patient strug
gle. In this ambition he looks to a son,
rapidly growing, into manhood and willing
to take up the struggle where the parent
leaves it. It is but natural that he should
give this. business to the son,_but_the la;
bor law of Australia decrees that the
father must not teach his son what he
has learned himself, but must apprentice
him out to some one else.
OFFICIALS ARE OVERPAID.
"The rigid enforcement of the working
hour law is also a hardship on many men.
I cannot understand why a man who is
anxious to work a few extra hours in or
der to increase his wealth and benefit his
conditions in the latter part of his life
should not be permitted to do so if he de
sires, but in Australia they declare that
he shall not work more than eight hours
and he has to bow to the will of those
who seemingly are now in power. An

For many of these conditions he blamed
the Labor party of Australia, and was
finally quoted as intimating that the col
ony was drifting away from the mother
country and might some day separate it
self from the latter. Asked last evening
regarding these statements, Lord Lons
dale admitted that he had found much in
Australia to satisfy him that radical
changes are necessary there to insure the
future success of the colony.
"There are many conditions there," said
he. "which are directly attributable to the
extreme measures adopted by the Legisl
laturo through the influence of the Labor
party, which at present controls the des
tinies of the colony. "The conditions im
posed on laboring men by their own peo
ple are. in many instances, according to
my way of thinking, very unjust and cer
tainly unreasonable. For instance, they
talk of making Australia a white man's
country, that iÂ«, prohibiting the employ
ment of black labor. They would exclude
all blacks, even those of local origin,
whereas it is a fact known to all people
of that country that in some sections of
Australia, particularly in the interior, the
white man cannot perform the labor re
quired and necessarily the blacks are ab
solutely indispensable.
UNFAIR TO THE SON.
RIGID LABOR LAWS.
In this statement, published in one of
the leading papers of Sydney, Lord Lons
dale declared that trouble was coming
upon Australia before many years had
passed; that she was overlegielated and
her politicians overpaid. Progress, he
said, was being barred by the legislators,
who were making It almost impossible for
great financial interests to become part
of the commonwealth.
Just before leaving Sydney Lord Lons
dale made a statement, which has since
been published over the entire world and
provoked much comment, especially com
ing, as it did, from a man of his prom
inence in the political affairs of Great
Britain and at a time when England was
in the heat of contentions between her
several party leaders and attacks were
being made upon her army and the meth
ods in which her recent war with the
Boers was conducted.
. Even In the British colonies of Austra

sorts of devices are resorted to for the
purpose of getting rid of sparrows, where
they bear a very bad name for their de

on the ground, another with blood. stream-
Ing from . a wound in his face, while in
the homes of the neighborhood victims
lay dead or writhing in agony. On Sun
day morning a church was attacked, in
the same neighborhood while service was
in progress, but no one was killed.
Panic-stricken, the Christians fled from
the city or remained in their homes be
hind barricaded doors, .jyhllo Moslems,
armed with clubs, revolvers and knives,
paraded the streets and fell on any chance
victim that came their way.
Monday found the situation no better.
All day stores remained closed, the streets
were deserted and business came to a
complete standstill., People remained at
homei afraid to venture out, and one or
two who did so were killed for their te
merity.
Fortunately the fanaticism, of the peo
ple has not yet gone so far beyond bounds
as to cause them to attack foreigners, but
business is at a standstill, the streets are
deserted and the shops are closed.
- Guards to watch the American property
here were furnished last night. Had the
Governor refused, Admiral Cotton stood
prepared to land &00 men if necessary. The
American ships played their searchlights
on the city, illuminating not alone the
property of the v Syrian Protestant College,
but also dark alleys and%byways frequent
ed as a rule by shady characters.
The disturbances here began on the
night of Friday, September 4. A murder
was committed in Beirut, which was by
no means an unusual thing, - but in this
Instance a non-Christian killed a Moslem.
The next morning the Christians in the
aommunity became much wrought up
over the affair and a genuine fight pre
vailed.

large numbers- to help along the work of
disorder.
The mass meeting of the men to-night
In the White House was unexpectedly
quiet and orderly. An attempt was made
to allay the passions of the men by an
offer made by the Brotherhod of Woods
men, an organization maintained among
the lumbermen; to supply an attorney free
of charge to collect all pay checks left In
his hands. The meeting broke up without
any -particular confusion or disorder.

Officers and Employes of the Consolidated
Lake 8ui*rior Company: The president and
directors *ln New York have been unable to
raise the money to pay to-day the wagts and
salaries now due the men and officers of the
company. Advices received from New York
this morninsr indicate that our president and
directors have a pl^n to raise the money nec
assary, to not only pay the men but to start
up the works, that seems to promise success.
The plan has the indorsement and promised
support at Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Premier of
Canada, and the Hon. G. W. Ross, Premier
of Ontario, and it ts expected to produce the
necessary money inside of thirty days.
While we regret very much the Inability of
the company to pay to-day, the fact remains
that there ls no money to pay with. There
seems to b? only one thing left for the men
to do, and that ls to accept offers to work else
where and ieave their checks with- friends, re

in mind that your wages will have to be paid
ultimately and constitute a Just obligation

Young Son of Public
Official Is Stolen by
Three Men.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU. Sept. 23.â Great excitement
was caused here yesterday when threa
men stole the 12-year-old son of Superin
tendent of Public Works Cooper from Pu-4
nahou Preparatory School and forced him
at the point of a pistol to Round Top, a
hill back of Honolulu, declaring that hia
father would have to pay a handsome sura
before he saw his son Theodore again.
One of the men went ahead to point out
the path and see that their actions were
not observed, while the others brought up
the rear, one with a club and the other
with a drawn revolver which he held
pointed at the frightened youth.
As the queer procession neared the sum
mit of Round Top the kidnapers, becom
ing thirsty with their exertions, looked
around for water and made for a tank in
the neighborhood. Noticing that the- re
volver carrier laid his weapon down to
stake his thirst, the boy. realizing hia
opportunity, made a break for liberty,
running as fast as hia bruised and bleed
ing bare feet could carry him in hi* head
long rush for freedom. He had almost
reached a turn In the road when a shot
rang out and a bullet went whizzing past
his ear. The next moment he was around
the corner and flying for home, where ha
arrived in such a state of fright that he
could barely relate hla experiences.
The boy described the three men as
white men. adding that one was of dark
complexion. Two of them, he says were
the same men who held him up recently
in his own house, while his parents were
fZl^i K? d } ound , ragged him and
locked him In a closet. That was only a
few weeks ago. "*

LABORERS ATTACK PUT AT SOQ.
The third, or Bowen protocol. Eigned in
Washing-ton on February 1?, 1WJ, covered
claims within the period from May 23,
1SS9, when General Castro, now President,
unfurled the standard of revolt, to June
30, 1903. The umpire named was Dutch
Consul Filz. The decision of Umpire Filz
has been attacked by all the Venezuelan
press.

The- second protocol, signed in Paris on
February 15, 1S02, between France and
Venezuela, stipulates that all claims prior
to ilay 23. 1S99. should be settled by arbi
tration and that the umpire should be the
Marquis of Muni. Spanish Embassador to
Paris. The tribunal in question assembled
here in March last and has just closed its
sessions.
The first protocol signed in Caracas be
tween the Venezuelan Government and
the French Charge d'Affaires, stipulating
a settlement of claims arising cut of the
revolution cf 1S<>2. has been carried into
effect.
, Light *is just being thrown on the acts
of the mixed tribunals which have been
sitting in Caracas since June 1 to pa*3
on the numerous claims brought by vari
ous nations for indemnity for damage suf
fered by citizens and subjects during the
revolutions which for so long agitated
Venezuela. These, are the amounts of tha
claims made by the several governments:
United States, $10,900,000; England. $2,500.

Spain. $600,000; Mexico. . $500,000; Holland,
$1,048,451; total, $43,499,813.
These claims will not be allowed in their
entirety. The American umpires, repre
senting England and Italy, will consid
erably diminish them, but it i-Â» not too
much to affirm that the amount of the
claims which must be allowed will ex
ceed 510.000,000.

MONASTIR, Macedonia,.Thursday, Sept
24.â It Is estimated that 50,000 villagers oC
the vilayet of Monastir are now refugees
in the mountains, most of them in a ter
ribly destitute condition. They escaped
from the 111 villages which have been
wholly or partially burned. by the Turks
and which contained 10,302 houses, of
which 96S8 were burned. At Malkairnovo
only a hundred Bulgarian families remain
of 1500.
The paper adds that it will "not be long
before everybody will try to force the
Government to take action."
The committee appointed for the pur
pose, at the time of yesterday's demon
stration of 15,000 Macedonians in this city,
waited on Premier PetrorZ to-day and
asked him If the Government intended to
do anything to help the Macedonians.
Petroff replied that the Ministry was act
ing- in what it conceived to be the best
interests of Bulgaria, and would continue
the same policy. The spokesman of the
committee told the Premier that his Â«e
ply would not be satisfactory to the peo
ple and the committee thereupon . with

situation, says:
Although the Bulgarians remain quiet, it
is not"a true indication of the national feel

"ACRAMEN'TO, Sept. 28.â Gover-

the report of the State Board of

The inference cf the Directors in their

On the morning of July 27, 1&33, .at
. about 7 o'clock, while the prisoners were
going out of the main building and when
o'vÂ«r S00 had reached the yard*, some
twelve or fourteen desperate convicts, all
arn^eij, poire with knives, some with
razors and some carrying dynamite,
br^ke from the line and attacked the om

Warden Wilkinson and Captain Murphy
in the captain's office, overpowered them
and threatened, with drawn knives, to
kill them should they make any resist

Is unanimously of the opinion that the

The board expresses ' itself as con

The board has issued orders, applicable

outbreak and prevented the prisoners from es

have surrendered the armory to the convicts."
The following' is also worthy of note: "So

of convicts at every hazard, that an order
has been issued making it the Imperative duty
of all officers and guards to prevent convicts

To the Honorable the Board of Prison Di
rectors of the State of California â Gentlemen:
I have before me your report on the disastrous
and lamerilable outbreak and escape of prison
ers from the penitentiary at Folsom.
It would appear from the evidence taken
before jour board Botne time elnce (a. report
of which has been placed before me by Pri
vate Secretary A. B. Nye, who was present
at the meeting of your board), that the whole
prison force, with two or three exceptions,

want of capacity and efficiency at the very
moment when called upon to show capacity
and efficiency.

COLON, Sept. 28.â Advices have been re

Congress has passed a law authorizing
the President to conclude a canal treaty
with the United States on a certain basis
without the approval of Congress.
President Castro of Venezuela is still
massing troops and ammunition along the
Maracalbo frontier, which causes alarm
in Colombia.
The report is sijrned by R. M. Fitzger
ald. Joseph H. Wilkins, C. N. Felton and
Don Rav.
No reformation, says the report, can be
hoped for under this system, though in
California it .has been administered bet
ter than ever before. Knlarged prison
facilities are asked for by the board for
both Folsom and San Quentin, and also
appropriations to employ more free help,
such as bookkeepers, stenographers, etc.
A wall about Folsom prison Is strongly
recommended.
The report concludes' by saying that It
has only "touched upon the outlines of
the Vvlls that exist.' " The most extra
ordinary precautions are being taken, say
the Directors, to prevent any further out
break at Folsom prison, but still the board
is convinced that many of the officers and
guards did not respond to the emergency
as they should, and "we are impressed
with the necessity of a thorough reor
ganization at Folsom prison." This, says
the Directors, is now engaging their earn
est attention."
The reccrt then fays: "It is a suffi
ciently difficult task to control the con
victs of the State under the svstem in
vogue, and which your board is convinced
is a disgrace to the State, without the
convicts feeling that the public at large
sympathize with them and not with the
officers of the law."
The "congregate system," the report
says, has been in use in this State for
fifty years, without change, though im
provements in administration have been
made. However, the board declares that
no prisoners are better fed and that the
health and physlcan condition of the pris
oners are most carefully guarded.
"We favor." pay the Directors, "using
physical punishment only when necessary
to maintain discipline. But the 'congre
gate system' Is what .we complain of.
This system has been abandoned by prac
tically every other State In the United
States," but California clings to it and
is really educating prisoners in crimeâ "is
a partner In crime."
These criticisms, says the report, have
not influenced the Directors, who realize
that they were made in ignorance of the
facts or by misguided sentimentalists, and
"that some day the people of California
would learn the truth about the prisons
of tfift State and would respond as gen
erously and promptly as they have to tttfe
needs of other departments of the gov
ernment."

"It was just as I expected. Long ago
I figured out that the American boat
should lead the Britisher by between 9

seeing a British boat capture the cup, for
I am of the opinion that it is almost a
physical Impossibility. I base this idea on
the fact that a boat can not be built on
lines that will permit her to make the
long ocean voyage and then engage suc
cessfully In a race. To cross the ocean
it is necessary to strengthen a boat to a
degree that is likely to make her cum

her finer points as a racing boat."

will in the future be her method of guard

"I have questioned her right to Korea,
but I look upon her relations toward
China as perfectly natural. She Is tho

conceded some rights In matters that con

Lord Lonsdale said that Russia's ex
tension of her railroad interests and the
interest she is showing in her Siberian
frontier and countries bordering on it
bodes no good to American trade. It will
not be long, said he, before Russia will
be competing with the United States in
the supplying of lumber to the Orient and
the Manchurian wheat will soon be in the
market as a competitor to the grain from
this country.

"I visited every port In China and was
greatly interested in my studies there. I
also paid particular heed to the affairs of
the Japanese. The latter are an ambitious
race and are constantly talking of war.
They feel very strong in their position
with the other great nations of the world
and honestly believe that they can fight
them all and walk all around the United
States. I am afraid that some day the
little brown men will be awakened to a
sudden and serious realization of their
mistake. As to possible war between
Japan and Russia, I doubt if they will
ever get together. I was not greatly im
pressed with the Japanese as a people.
They are dishonest in their methods and
there is evidence of the fact to be found
on every side. Why, even In their own
banks, when you call and ask for a
cashier they bow and scrape and finally
lead you along to a desk and introduce
you to a Chinese, who handles the cash.
They do not keep their word, and in busi
ness methods are tricky and unreliable.
RUSSIA WELL PREPARED.
"A Chinese, if he agrees to do a thing,
will do it, but the Japanese will try to
evade the conditions of a contract entered
Into If he sees the slightest chance of
benefiting himself In the smallest degree.
And again the Japanese are as bad as
the Chinese In the matter of sending
money out of a country. The Japanese
will come among you, work for just as
cheap wages as the Chinaman, and as
soon as he gets a little money saved up.
I note. also, what you pay about the neces
sity of so improving the two prisons as to per
mit the substitution for the present "congre
gate system" the more modern, humane and
safer method whereby each prisoner shall be
separately confined. Your board has recom
mended this change in system, I am informed,
a number of times. : It is, of course, a matter
for legislative action. But I agree -with you
as to its necessity and shall hope, with you,
that the Legislature, at Its next session, may
make sufficient appropriations, both for this
find such other lmprovemnts as may appear to
be necessary.
I congratulate you upon this statement In
your report: "For years your board has en
deavored to eliminate from the management
of the State prisons any political Influence or
interference, and that Is Its present aim. We
are pleased to say that we have succeeded in
this to a very great extent, and wish to .ac
knowledge our appreciation of your expressed
desire to aid In this particular."
In conclusion, gentlemen of the board, let ma
say that It devolves upon you to conduct the af
fairs of the prisons. I have every confidence
In your desire to so conduct them that no Just
criticism can flow to you. and that, bo far as
possible, they may be made what they were In
tended to be. viz. : places of detention and pun
ishment for those who break the law and re
formatories for such prisoners as may be ca
pable of reform. And of your integrity and
capability well and properly to manage the in
stitutions committed to your care I have no
doubt. GEORGE C. .PARDEE, I
Governor of California.
I also note your disapproval of that unjust
bias which makes the public bo ready to take
the part of desperate men confined in prisons
for infractions of the law against the prison
officials when the latter are compelled to take
decisive steps to control their charges and pre
serve discipline. Those who know how des
perate and abandoned many of the convicts
confined In our prisons are agree with you
thoroughly in your condemnation of that public
sentiment which, knowing nothing of the true
prison conditions, refuses to believe that harsh
measures are frequently necessary to disci
pline those men who will stop at no brutality,
even murder, to wreak their vengeance upon
those who betray their plots and conspiracies,
or to effect their escape from the charge of
those whom the law has put over them. With
you, I am convinced that those who come clos
est In contact with the convicts In our prisons
know best how to manage them. It Is always
safest, I think, in human affairs, to look out
for the best results in any particular matter
at the hands of those who are expert In It.
tint. In my opinion, too much censure cannot
be visited upon those guards and officials who
obeyed the order not to resist the escaping
prisoners. Orders tlven by officials in the
hancs of convicts are not the order* of the
officials, but are the orders ofÂ« '.he convicts
themselves. And any free prison official or
guard who, under these or any other circum
stances, obeys the orders of convicts, is guilty
of the grossest breach of discipline and de
servlr.jr of the severest censure. And I re
peat, from the evidence .taken before your
board,' it appears to be that the whole prison
force, with few exceptions, at the point of
the outbreak became thoroughly demoralized
and for the time belnc absolutely Inefficient.
And, in my Judgment. It is not necessary to
consider whether or not they, or any of them,
were guilty of cowardice.
In your report you have mentioned one or
two cases of especially noteworthy abject neg
lect of duty by prison officials at the com
mands of the escaping convicts. One of the
most aggravated, and aggravating, examples
of this appears to me to be the case of the
guard who, mounted on horseback and armed
with a sun, rode up, at the command of the
convicts, and surrendered himself and his
weapon into their hands.
I note, also, your recommendation that cer
tain convicts be granted executive clemency
as a reward for services rendered to the of
ficials at the time of the outbreak. You men
tion particularly Joseph . Casey, a life-termer;
John Martinez, serving a twenty-year sentence
since 1S05; Charles Abbott, second-termer,
serving a life sentence: O. C. Clark, a ninth
termer, serving a twenty-year sentence, and
William Grlder, a third-termer, servinsr a five
year sentence. I shall certainly take heed of
your recommendations in these ca*es, and I
agree with you that convicts who aid the
prison authorities to preserve order and prison
discipline should receive some reward lor their
services.
I am ni>t disuospd to attree \u25a0with those who
harshly criticize the Warden, and t':ose who
with him were prisoners in the hands of the
convicts, for. under pain of instant Ueath at
the hands of their desperate captors, ordering
ths free guards not to flre upon the escapes.
Even the lives 01 prison otliciuls are sweet
an i dear to them.
of your report: "And we are Impressed with
the necessity of a thorough reorganization at
F"olsom Prison." And I am very glad that
"this is now engaging our (your) earnest and
continued attention, and we (you) will accom
plish It at the earliest possible moment." I
have pvery faith in your sincerity In making
this statement: and hope that circumstances
will not compel you to put oft its accomplish
ment very lor.g. . â¢ .
But this will change, especially as it is al
most certain that, with the Inability of cor
porations to finance their requirements, general
business throughout the country must, after a
time, fall off. and when that moment arrives
we shall have a large amount of funds seeking
employment. These surplus funds will, to
some extent, determine the value, for ordinary
purposes, of a superabundant volume of cur
rency and we shall witness an increased de
mand for securities. It is not at all unlikely,
however, that when railroad earnings begin to
decrease because of reduced general business
the values of railroad securities will begin to
again increase.
It does not appear likely that the much feared
money strinRcncy will materialize. In fact,
money is abundant now. only those who con
trol the supply are afraid In the uncertain
state of affairs to part with It. The conse
quence is that we have a superabundant supply
of money on daily call, while time money can
not be had in large amounts.
It Is simply a. fever which must run Its
course. Just as we had a buying fever two
years api and even last year, bo the selling
fever has now taken hold of the people and
reason counts for nothing.
No matter what may be said as to the causes
which have brought about the present situa
tion, prevailing condition*' throughout the coun
try do not Justify the existing great decline in
substantial securities. The time will come
when people will wonder how conditions such
as we see now could have existed.
Jacob II. Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.,
commenting upon stock market condi
tions, said:
The conditions which prompt the liqui
dation and the probable limits of its ex
tent are consequently the cause of grave
disquiet and apprehension. It was the
failure of stock jobbing operations that
brought the early selling, and the losses
reported were almost wholly on paper,
as the previous gains had been.
But later episodes represent the failure
of enterprises in which extensive capital
has been embarked, at demonstrably un
productive'employment. Capital thus sunk
Is capital lost.
Comptroller Ridgley's expression, used
before the Maryland and Washington
bankers, that "a large percentage of the
leaning power has gone Into unproductive
interests," formulates the dread of Wall
street over the present situation. The re
action ' in the iron and steel industries,
the high interest rates, especially on mer
cantile paper, and the curtailment of pro
duction In other lines caused the fear that
over-extension has spread to industrial
nnd commercial lines, representing addi
tional "unproductive interests," to be fol
lowed by liquidation and contraction.
The present course of the banks is di
rected toward conserving the commercial
and Industrial needs of credits, and to
this end they are inexorable to all pro
motion and financing projects. ( The mis
carriage of these projects is still the
cause of most of the liquidation. While
the great majority of Wall street's prbm
lnent men show a decided disinclination
to talk for publication, inquiry among the
very highest Interests elicits statements
that nothing of a serious or untoward
character is apprehended.
SIMPLY A SEIZING FEVER.
There Is, in fact, rather a notable lack
of public statements by men of authority
pointing to the cheapness of stocks, which
were heard from time to time during the
course of the long decline and at price
levels considerably above the present. But
it is equally true that men seeking a
market to realize ready money at forced
sales of securities are not likely to miss
any means of concealing their transac
tions. The source of selling orders In the
present market is a baffling mystery, and
inferences usually drawn from the per
sonality of the brokers employed are al
most invariably at fault.
FAILURE OF ENTERPBISES.
NEW YORK. Sept. 28.â Wall street spent
another gloomy day, which was devoted
mostly to trying to puzzle out where the
unending stream of liquidation came from
and what caused It. Information on the
subject, or even authoritative opinions,
were extremely hard to get. It i!3 pointed
out that great bankers and capitalists
-were not heard giving warnings last year
during the high range of prices while
they were seeking a profitable market for
their holdings. From this it is Inferred
that the buyers of a class which decides
market movements would not be heard of
Inciting others to buy if they were them
selves seeking securities on cheap terms
In the present market.

"Are Made During
the Debate.
though the majority and minor
ity had burled their differences and a
united Democracy, for which Franklin K.
Lane, the nominee for Mayor, so devout
edly wished, had come, but all this was
.dispelled when the Committee on Super
visors submitted its report on eighteen
names to be placed on the ticket at the
coming municipal election. The minority
Submitted three names to the committee
and only two were accepted. Edward
Rock, Carl Westerfeld and Charles Wes
ley Reed were the choice of the minority.
Reed wes Inimical to the rulers of the
majority and his name was stricken
from the list and the name of Edward
Gleason substituted.
When the minority learned of this
there was a howl of Indignation, and In
an instant the entire convention, which
had beeen a harmonious gathering, be
came a turbulent one. There were cries
of treachery end charges of unfair deal-
Ing. Joseph E. O'Donnell. George Galla
pher and others in the minority raised
their voices In Indignation over the man
ner in which they were treated. De
pplte their objections the report of thÂ«
committee was adopted. The mi
nority now vows vengeance and will re
fuse to make the nomination of Mr.
Lane unanimous. The convention broke
up in disorder and some more hot bat
tling is anticipated when the delegates
meet again to-morrow evening.
Owing to the mooting of the commit
tee of eight selected by the minority to
mÂ«et a like committee from the major
ity, the convention did not go into ses
sion until 9:25 o'clock. The names sub
mitted by the minority were taken un
der advisement, and the committee on
THE Democratic municipal con
vention has not yet reached a
condition of harmony. For a
time last evening it looked as
MANILA, Sept. 28.â Dominado Gomes
was to-day sentenced to four years and
two months' Imprisonment and fined 1200.
Maximum bail was refused pending an
appeal. The Filipino Assessors dissented
from the decision. Gomez, who was a
former Spanish officer, was" charged with
founding the Union Obrcra, an organ
ization which was inciting the natives to
rebellion.
Gomez Receives a Heavy Sentence.
cheered loudly for "Billy" Hynes. Mr.
Cullinan spoke as follows:
The office of Public Administrator is one of
great trust. The occupant of that office there
fore should be a man ekllled In affairs, accus
tomed to business methods and capable of man
aging safely and shrewdly the estates confided
to his care. Michael J. Hynes is such a man.
Mr. Hynea Is better known, I think, to you
all as "Billy" Hyne*. He was born in this
city, has grown up here, and he is now the
cashier and secretary and a stockholder of one
of the largest dry roods nouses in San Fran
cisco. He is better known to the public, how
ever, as the man who Elngs the laughing song,
and as one of the jolliest and best fellows in
the city. Mr. Hynee has put under obligations
every church, every society, every clut> â I
might almost says every Individual, In San
Francisco. Ills time and talent have been al
ways at the service of friends of good fellow
ship, of religion, of charity. He has never
before asked for a favor In return from the
public. He Is a Democrat, but he Is net a poli
tician, and he now comes for the flret time
before the people. His training has been such
as to fit him to be a competent Public Admin
istrator, and I believe that If you nominate
"Billy" Hynes you will have not only the best
possible candidate, but be electing the best pos
sible man to fill the. office. I therefore place In
nomination Michael J. Hynes. /
HYNES RESPONDS.
William Ross and John J. Gleason In
formed the convention that it gave them
grpat delight to second the nomination.
There were loud cries for Hynes, and to
still the clamor the comedian was invited
to the platform. There were demands for
a song, but Hynes responded as follows:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the con
vention: The opposition have accused the
Democrats of taking everything, and I really
hate to take the platform. (Laughter and ap-,
plause.) Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen of the
convention, fellow Democrats and friends â
that was a pretty good line, I think (renewed
laughter). You know I flatter myself I eatd it
fairly well, when you come to consider that
that was the first time In my life that I ever
had, occasion to use the expression. I didn't
expect to come up here at all, and really the
invitation to come up comes upon me so sud
denly I hardly know what to say to you, and
I feel very much In the position of the young
fellow who took a young maid out for a
skate. The ice was pretty thin, and they
both fell through, but with the assistance of
Rome friends he managed to get out all right,
and he turned around to see where she was.
There she was struggling In the Ice. He
reached out as far as he could, and he said.
"Agnes, Agnes, give me your hand!" She
said, "O George, this la so sudden!" (Laugh
ter.) Now, that Is the way I feel about It;
I feel that this Is very sudden. And I also feel
that if you will all lend me a helping hand
I have no doubt In the world of the result,
except possibly that after election Is over I
might find myself In the position of the young
American heiress who married one of these
cheap European noblemen, and shortly after
the interesting event had occurred she sud
denly discovered that she hadn't got a square
count. (Laughter.) Now, gentlemen, In con
clusion I want to Bay a f ew words to you â
Just in conclusion. I want to say that I ap
preciate, highly, very highly, and I thank you
from the bottom of my heart for the- honor
that you have conferred upon me In placing
me before the people of this city and county
for the office of Public Administrator. Gen
tlemen of the convention, again I thank you.
(Applause.)
Osgood Putnam presented the report of
the, committee on Supervisors at this
Juncture, and the fun began. The dele
gates listened attentively to the reading
of the names in the report, which ap
peared in the following' order:
A. Comte Jr., H. MY Brandenstein, Sam
uel Braunhart, J. P. Bo#th, John Connor,
A. A. d'Ancona, Henry Payot, Robert J.
Loughery, John A. Lynch, George B. Mc-
Clellan, T. Cary Friedlander, Frank J.
Grace, John Barnett, Dr. Fred "A. Grazer,
Oscar Hocks, Edward Rock, Carl Wester
feld* and Edward Gleason. A motion to
adopt the report as read met with strong
opposition. The minority declared it had
been tricked* and a dozen delegates were
on their feet demanding a hearing.
FIGHT COMMENCES.
Joseph E. O'Donnell, the acknowledged
leader of the minority, was recognized,'
and he calmly offered as an' amendment
that the name of . Edward Gleason be
stricken from the list and the name of
Charles Wesley Reed ' substituted. The
motion wa3 seconded by, George E. ' Gal-
Supervisors asked further time to de
liberate. In the interim four or five
nominations were made and the minor
ity leaders took pleasure in not only
seconding the nominations but in mov
ing: to make them unanimous.
DODGE NOMINATED.
On calling the convention to order
Cl.aiman Thomas W. Hickey announced
that the first business of the evening
was the reading of the report of the com
mitt'x* of eight. Osgood Putnam, chair
man of the committee, asked for further
time. Nominations for Assessor were
next in order, and William M. Cannon
took the platform to place the name of
Dr. Washington Dodge, incumbent of the
office, before the convention. When
Assessor Dodge's name was mentioned
theref was hearty applause. Mr. Can
non si>oke as follows:
I have had a severe cough to-day, but if I
can control my voice long enough I am going
to place In nomination for Assessor of thla
city and county Dr. Washington Dodsre.
(Applause.) When Dr. Dodge was nominated
for Assessor in 1S9S there was entrenched in
the office a gentleman whom It was supposed
cnuld not be defeated; it was supposed that
Dr. Dodge, when he accepted that nomination,
was to lead a forlorn hope. But he went into
the fight valiantly; he went out among the
people; he explained to them the iniquitous
condition of the assessment of this city and
county for years past; he promised them dras
tic reforms, and they believed him, for they
elected him Assessor over his powerful oppo
nent by a majority of S00O votes. A year
later he went before the people again to glvt
an account of his stewardship; he told them
the condition In which he had found things; he
ehowed them that in the one short year of his
incumbency he had materially reduced the
assessment upon the homes of the email
home-owners of, this city, while, on the other
hand, he had assessed property which had
theretofore esoaood taxation entirely In an
amount exceeding Â£55,000,000, or, rather had
lncreaÂ«t-d the assessment roll In that one year
over ?Ji5,000.000. And now. after four more
years of faithful service in that office to which
he was elected at the election four years ago
by a majority greater than the total vote of
his opponent, by a majority greater than was
ever received by any other candidate in this
city and county, carrying, as he did, every
precinct tn the city, he appears before you
ag-ain. and I humbly appear on his behalf,
asking you whether or not you indorse hlÂ«
course in office, and, if you do, to again place
him In nomination for the office he has bo
favorably filled during the last five years.
Mr. Chairman, I take great pleasure In
placing before this convention for the office
of AFfessor that Nemesis of the tax-dod*er
and the friend of the taxpayer, Dr. Washing
ton Dodpe. (Applause.)
Joseph E. O'Donnell took the floor and
in behalf of the Thirty-sixth District sec
onded the nomination of Dr. Dodge. John
H. Mullen and Messrs. Haley and Van
Wyck also added their meed of praise
in seconding the nomination. Dr. Dodge
being the choice of the convention, the
secretary was instructed to cast the bal
lot, which he did.
BYHTCrTON IS NAMED.
District Attorney Lewis F. Byington
was placed in nomination for his present
position by J. C. Sims. Mr. Sims paid
Byington some fine tributes. He spoke
at lensth, and when he said that his
candidate was wiser than Solomon the
sally was received with a laugh. Mr. Sims
spoke as follows:
I congratulate this convention upon its hav
ing placed at the head of the Democratic mu
nicipal ticket In this campaign as able, as pa
triotic, and as gifted a leader as ever graced
a party 1 * or a people's cause. Undoubtedly
he will uphold the f-tandard of Democracy and
pure government triumphantly and far In ad
vance while the tlephant tramps in the dis
tant dust bearing Uncle Sam's postofflce- and
Its discredited and corrupt officials on its back.
His voice will be heard amid the plaudits and
the acclamations of his fellow citizens when
the former leader of the "Florodora" march
will play his fiddle to listless audiences and
with that discord and lack of harmony which
has bo characterized hl3 brief, inconsistent and
useless political career.
Upon this ticket which you are now com
pleting I ask you to place a man who Is a fit
and worthy associate of our nominees and Is
the peer of any man who has been placed
or who will be placed upon our ticket. Gen
tlemen, he is a wiser man than Solomon.
(Laughter.) The Democratic party has existed
elnce the birth of the nation, and it will ex
ist and flourish until popular government be
longs to long-vanished times. It has seen all
other political parties rise and fall; It has
seen them buried In nameless, unnumbered and
forgotten graves, and I believe that it will
6ee the funeral of the Republican party its
present and greatest adversary.
The man for whose cause I speak is a
Democrat In the fullest and highest and best
sense. He cherishes the tradition* of the
party and is attached to its theories, princi
ples and policies. Among the people of Cali
fornia Lewis F. Byington stands peerless. No
one is more favorably known throughout this,
his native State, and no one takes greater
pride In Its grandeur and greatness, and great
er happiness in the giant trend of human ac
tivities from the East to the land of the sink
ing sun. If he Is nominated you may reckon
with absolute certainty that he will be the"
District Attorney, and no one can with -any
hope or reason look outside of the District At
torney'B office for any part of his power in
fluence, conscience or intelligence.
During his incumbency he has investigated
crime he has convicted more criminals de
servedly than any one who has ever held the
office in the history of Ban Francisco. His
able, pure, hlghminded. official life - haa
strengthened, purified and elevated our politi
cal condition. He has always stood for a rig
orous and vigorous investigation of criminal
conduct with Intrepidity and strict regard to
Justice. Gentlemen, if you wtoh a man In the
office of legal learning, of undimmed honor,
who uphold* the hltrh utandards of official
life. I feel that you are bound to give Lewis
F. Byington your unanimous support upon his
record in the past and what you know It will
be In the \u25a0 future, having the lamp of expe
rience for your guide. (Applause.)
There were no further nominations and
Mr. Byington was nominated by the
unanimous vote of the convention. There
was loud cheering for Byington and the
delegates and spectators called for the
popular official, but Chairman Hickey
brought hia hammer down on the anvil
and declared that nominations for Coro
ner were in order.
EULOGIZES DBl LELAND. 7 "
Louis Ferrari, a young man who halls
from the Thirty-third Assembly District,
placed Thomas B. W. Leland in nomina
tion for Coroner. He made a clever
speech and his earnestness was notice
able to the deleeates, who received his
speech with a great deal of good nature.
Ferrari spoke as follows:
The Democratic party of San Francisco can
well be proud of the men whom they have
placed In office during the past tlx years.
Since the Introduction of our charter no
scandal, no misconduct in office haa marred
the record of a single Democratic official. It
la then only Juat that this convention should
renomlnate those men who have bullded the
reputation of the Democratic party for placing
honest public servants in office, nnd it la
only justice that the people of) San Francisco,
In recognition of the good that these men
have done to our municipality should re-elect
them. I feel proud, therefore, at this time
to be able to offer as a nominee for the office
of Coroner the Incumbent. Dr. Thomas B. W.
Leland. When Dr. Leiand first entered upon
his duty as Coroner of the city and county of
San Francisco his office was far from meeting
the requirements of a large and growing city,
but by dint of hard work and constant ap
plication Dr. 1 Leland added improvement to
Improvement /until to-day the Coroner's office,
in conduct and equipment, can stand com
parison with that or any city In the United
States.
In the conduct of his inquests Dr. Iceland
has carried on his Investigations fearlessly, fully
and fairly, with a view to place the responsi
bility where it justly lay, whether the re
sponsble party was a rich corporation or an
ordinary citizen. Dr. Leland has at all times
kept aloof from corporate influence and po
litical pulls In the discharge of his duty, and
he haa made it a constant aim to give Justice
to the rch and poor alike. But in all that
Dr Leland has done for San Francisco I know
that he cherishes. in his heart a desire to give
to San Francisco the best Coroner's office in
existence. And I further know tÂ»iat if he
be given another term in office two years
hence we shall see the realization of his hopes
and the Coroner's, of flee of San Francisco will
stand as a living. memorial and a testimonial
to his everlasting effort to give to San Fran
cisco the best that was In him. But there
is a further reason why- this convention should
nominate Dr. Leland, and that is that he is
a sure winner and will add a tower of strength
to the ticket. There Is a further reason: Ow.
Ing to the number of political parties now in
the arena next election day will be accom
panied by a greater number of political corpses
than usual, and it is our duty to give them a
decent Democratic burial at the hands of a
Democratic Coroner. In conclusion I will state
that I feel deeply the exalted honor that has
been bestowed upon me in permitting; me to
nominate Dr. Thomas B. W. Iceland for the
office of Coroner. (Applause.)
Charles S. Peery seconded the nomina
tion of Dr. Leland from the floor of the
convention. He spoke about a reunited
Democracy and also praised Dr. Leland
for his worth as a citizen and an official.
CrODCTKATTX FAVORED.
When nominations were closed Dr. Le
land received the unanimous vote of the
convention. Chairman Hickey then called
for nominations for Recorder, and Os
good Putnam, chairman of the Commit
tee on Supervisors, broke away from the
committee in order to place the name of
Edmund Godchaux before the delegates.
He spoke as follows:
Fortunately, we have to present to you this
evening a gentleman whose record speaks for
Itself, a gentleman who is unpretentious, unos
tentatious, whose record stands before you with
out any ostentation; a gentleman who in his
demeanor is modest and full of courtesy, and
yet one who Is stanch upon principle; a gentle
roan who has conducted ' his office in the past
so that he is a credit to you as a party; he
stands before the community now as a Demo
cratic candidate and as a candidate of the peo
ple of the city and county of San Francisco, a
man that everybody can vote for; and. without
taking any more time, gentlemen, I will nomi
nate as Recorder Kdmund Godchaux.
Matthew Brady seconded the nomina
tion, as did other delegates. Mr. God
chaux was nominated by acclamation and
the secretary was ordered to cast the vote
of the convention \u25a0 for him.
Eustace Cullinan took the platform to
nominate Michael J. Hynes for Public
Administrator. He informed the delegates
at the outset of his speech that Mr.
Hynes was familiarly. Called "Billy" and
was the talented fellow who .sang '~ the
"laughing song" with such success. ' This
enlightened the delegates and they
George E. Gallagher told some plain
truths to the delegates. He did not mince
words, and his voice rang through the
convention hall in protest. He was inter
rupted time and again by the friends of
the County Committee, but he spoke with
out fear. He said:
I can tell you, Mr. Chairman, that I seconded
that amendment in good faith. I have tried to
act my part during this convention as a Demo
crat, always acting in good faith for the wel
fare of the party and for the good of Democrats
at large, if they would let me act as such; but
it seems all the time, from the first evening
this convention convened until the present hour,
they have tried to give us a Elap in our faces.
I was told to-day by an officer of this conven
tion that if this ticket was put up let those
support the blame who made the ticket, let
them shoulder the responsibility, and I answered
them back that I was perfectly willing at any
stage of the game to shoulder the part that be
longs to me. But not to the minority belongs
all the blame, because there are five members
of the majority on the committee that must
shoulder their share, and I demand that they
do it. The time came when the majority said
they had proposals to make to us, and we met
them, not once, but twice. Their nominee for
Mayor wrote a letter to this convention In which
he said he would not take the nomination un
less. hÂ« led a united party; at no time would
he stand for a divided party. He made an
other assertion in that letter that he would not
run unless he had a committee on Supervisors
to propose men tried and true, well known in
the community and willing to follow htm on
his mission of reform. That was good. We
were willing for that. That suited the minori
ty, because we have in that minority a few re
epectabla men. We don't claim they are all re
spectable, because that might hurt the ideas of
the majority. We have been forced Into this
position, and I, in seconding that amendment,
want to stand where the member* of the mi
nority will know where I stand. I am no
friend of Wesley Reed. I know the gentleman
very slightly. But this V will gay, in conclu
sion: We selected three names to-night in good
faith, after due canvass with 'the minority. I
proposed no name. I simply cast my . vote In
the minority for three names we thought were
good enough to Bit on the board, men who are
among the best in this community. .So, in se
lecting the names we thought we would live up
to the standard that you would give. Now, I
will go back. I was going to say that we ap
pointed a committee to wait upon the gentle
man who is going to take the nomination, prob
ably, for Mayor, and he Informed the committee
that he did not know an individual proposed bo
far for Supervisor; he was willing to leave it
to â¢ that committee â¢ of ; seven, among whom we
were \u25a0 not fit to have one representative. Is
that Democratic politics? Is that politics of
the great American people, for the people and
.W tbe people? I say no! I eay it is exclu-
TELLS PLAIN TRUTHS.
If you will permit me a few words us chair
man cf this committee, we have considered
every name presented by majority or minor
ity of any kind and character; that included
every member of this convention and a great
many outside. "We have had numerous meet
ings, and our total endeavor has been to
present to this convention names that will be
agreeable to the members and satisfactory tj
the voters at large. The labor has been great,
and we have endeavored to meet the wishes of
every single member on the floor of this house.
There is not a single name there that has not
been considered with that in view, and with a
desire to please every single member of
this body, and the labor has been complete.
It is handed to you as a whole; it represents
a harmonization of the forces, and I think
the gentleman who has moved that amend
ment will not UDon second thought find it
necessary to make even one change in that
report.
Osgood Putnam, who represented the
majority and as chairman of the com
mittee, was next heard. He was heartily
applauded by the majority at the conclu
sion of his speech. He spoke as follows:
For the information of this convention,
which seems to think that I should not have
offered this amendment. I desire to say that
your committee has accepted two men rec
ommended by the minority of this convention
and have omitted the third recommended by
the minority. I desire to state that overtures
have been made looking to the harmonization
of results in this convention, and as a part
of those overtures, in good faith the minority
of this convention has. after careful deliber
ation, selected these three names and offered
them as their proportional representation to
which they feel themselves entitled â three out
of eighteen on that board; and I therefore
demand, in Justice to this minority, that no
shuffling be done with the names recommend
ed by uhl
lagher, and the fight was on. O'Donnell
tooktthe floor to explain his amendment.
He made the following statement:
The Secretary of the Interior is charged
with unlawful acts to defraud the In
dians, such as that of encouraging white
men who have married squaws to make
claim to Delaware lands.
In this petition the Indiana make some
sensational statements. One of these ac
cusations Is to the effect that members of
the Dawes Commission are Interested in
oil leases and companies holding leases
made upon their lands by Cherokees
claiming title. Mentioning the members or
the committee, the complaint alleges that
"notwithstanding that the lands have
been properly segregated the Dawes Com
mission, disregarding their official duties
as agents of. the United States toward
your petitioner?, have conspired, confed
erated, and are conspiring and confeder
ating, together with the said companies,
to cheat and defraud your petitioners so
as to gain possession of their lands for
themselves or for their eaid companies,
under pretense of allotting said lands in
their official capacity as said Dawes Com
mission, to divers persons who are will
ing to' enter into contracts of lease and
sale with representatives of said trust and *
land companies, in which the members
of - said Dawes Commission " are Inter
ested."
Soon after the decision was rendered
Attorney Walter S. L*-gan filed a peti
tion in the Court cf Claims on behalf of
the DeU.wares against the United States
asking that damages be awarded in the
sum of $1,000,000 because of expenses to
which the Indians have been subjected
because of the necessity of defending title
to their lands.
The Indians claimed that the Secretary
was without authority to approve or dis
approve of the segregation, as it had been
approved by the Indians interested, and
asked that he be enjoined against taking
such action pending the adjudication of
the same question by the Court of Claims.
Soon after the case was filed the court
granted a temporary injunction, but Judza
Anderson to-day dissolved It.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2S.-Justlce An
derson of the Supreme Court of the Dis
trict of Columbia rendered an opinion to
day in the injunction proceeding of the
Delaware Indians against Secretary
Hitchcock and the Dawes Indian Com
mission, dissolving the temporary injunc
tion heretofore granted. The case In
volved the right of the Secretary .to pass
on the liT.OOO acres of land In the Chero
kee nation segregated for the use of the
Delawares.

Chairman Hickey (continuing) â I submit that
the tenor of the gentleman's remarks is ex
actly the same. A threat Is made to the
majority and a defiance is flung out to them
that they must saddle the blame. What blame,
what blame? Who is this man that we must
raddle the blame upon ourselves if. in the

people of San Francisco are more important
than any party. The life and the future of

THBEAT IS MADE.
Hickey thought it was time
for him to take a hand In the debate, and
he handed over hi3 gavel to Walter de
Martini and in a dramatic manner deliv
ered a speech in which he tried to put
it up to Gallagher, but the latter would
not have it. Hickey was fervent in his
remarks and was loudly cheered by the
friends of the McNab crowd. He said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Con
vention: In the name of the Democrats of
San Francisco I resent the last remark made
by the speaker 'who preceded me when he said
that so long as one .name was left off that
ticket let those who leave It off shoulder the
responsibility, and the ticket suffer. "Who is
the man whose name it Is insisted shall go on
this ticket? Is he greater than the whole
Democratic party? (Applause.) On what meat
doth this our Caesar feed that he is grown eo
great? The Democrats of this city (hisses â one
moment, gentlemen, only geese and snakes
hiss.) (Applause.) I come from a district of
Democrats â Democrats first. last and all the
time, the biggest Democratic district In the
State of California. I speak for them when I
say that they resent the remark of this man
who says that if a certain man is not nom
inated for Supervisor thi3 ticket will go down.
It will not go down. (Applause.) I say to you
that this ticket will not go down. This ticket
is bigger than any Supervisor. (Applause and
confusion.) Gentlemen, as chairman of this
convention. I have given every man in it a
fair chance. I have very seldom If ever call
ed a man to order, and I ask your permis
sion to speak for just one moment This
miwis more than the nomination of a Su
pervisor. The issue- made now is this, and it
is made by the speaker who preceded me; the
issue is this: Does thiB whole ticket depend
upon the nomination of this single man for
Supervisor? (No. no; yes. yes. and general
confusion.) Democrats of San Francisco, an
swer this question: Is there one'mn in this
whole convention who will say that there is
one man so great that his nomination or de
feat for SupervHor means more than the
whole ticket? ("No, no.")^I am speaking for
Democrats. I am speaking to men. big men.
I am speaking to the majority and the minority
in this convention. Don't attempt to take one
Supervisor and cram him down the throats of
the Democrats of San Francisco, and Bay to
them. "You must take this man or we will
defeat your whole ticket." You can't mean
that. . You don't mean that* and I know the
gentleman who preceded me doesn't mean
anything of thÂ« kind, and in order that hÂ«
should bo righted before the public I desire
to express my sentiments upon the matter
and yield the floor to him.
Mr Gallagher (interrupting) â With due re
spect to you, who have acted as an unbiased,
fair and unprejudiced chairman. I beg to in
form you that you are misquoting me, not in
tentionally, because I know you are too good
a friend of mine to do It. g I did not say the
ticket would go down. I used no such ex
pression. I simply stated that the three names
were proposed by the minority, that one name
was eliminated from the list intentionally, and
the people who were doing It were insulting
this minority and slapping it In the face, and
they must shoulder that responsibility and ac
cept the blame.
siveness in the extreme. I want to say now.
in conclusion, that no man is better known
from Shasta to San Diego than the man whose
name they have omitted from that ticket, and I
further say that, while his name is off the
ticket, let them shoulder the responsibility '.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 28.â To-day's
sessions of the convention of the Inter
national Association of the Structural
Iron and Bridge Workers were taken up
entirely with routine matters. The Parks
crowd helped clear up the small business
of the gathering and no signs of the fight
between the two factions promised yes
terday were visible. President Buchanan
made an appeal for harmony and his talk
had the effect, at least temporarily, of
quieting the troublesome New Yorkers.
"It's the lull before the storm," said one
delegate, after the convention had ad
journed for the day.
The sum total of the day's work was
the granting of a charter to the architec
tural iron workers of Chicago, a strong
labor body, which has perhaps 6000 mem
bers throughout the country, and a deci
sion to send delegates to the convention
of the Building Trades Alliance, to be
held at Indianapolis next month. An Im
portant petition presented by a half
dozen Western locals recommended that
the convention take some action to force
certain Western railroads to pay-standard
wages or let the bridge work to contrac
tors who are fair to organized labor.

The committee of arrangements for the
Centennial informed the union to-night
that the invitation to the marine band
would stand, no matter what action was
taken by the local musicians. The union
at once decided that it could not recede
from the position it had taken and it so
informed the committee. It was decided
by the committee to go ahead with their
plans just as though there was no such
thing as music. The playing by the.
marine band Thursday night will there
fore be the only music of the celebration.
It was not the intention of the commit
tee to use the marine band for anything
but the mass meeting on that one even
ing.
The union declares that its constitution
forbids its members to have anything to
do with an evept in which enlisted men
in the Government service take part. The
union therefore demands that the invita
tion to the marine band be withdrawn or
the union musicians would decline to fur
nish music for the panide, for the ban

for any other part of the Centennial cele

of Washington is to play at the mass
meeting at the Auditorium on Thursday
night, which is to be (he final act of tho
celebration.
ST. PAUL, Sept. 2S.â General Manager
Thomas W. Cooper of the Northern Pa

Northern Pacific Company by parties in

are, but are using all the efforts-possible
to discover and arrest them. We have
taken sufficient precaution to make our

"The Northern Pacific has posted a re

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 28.â According to
the positive statement of Joseph Mesmer,
brother of Mrs. Griffith J. Griffith, the
attorneys of Colonel Griffith have offered
her $35,000 cash in settlement of all prop

One condition of the offer is that if, by
the acceptance of this $35,000 tender, the

"Five hundred dollars a month is not

Becker_ as he turned away. He left in

AtGreenbrae he took the train for San
Francisco.
Ten other convicts left the prison to
day, all but one, however, much later
than Becker. Joseph Goodwin. No. 14,563,
who had been Incarcerated for twenty
years, went out. Goodwin, or familiarly
known abound the prison as "Coffee Jose,"
was convicted of murder in the second
degree in Shasta County in 1SS3. He was
sent to San Quentin for twenty years and
has served the full time.
When approached by a Call representa

cative. He would not state his ultimate
destination, claiming that "Frisco will be
my home for some time to come." He
would neither admit nor deny that he
would accept an offer of $500 per month
from the American Bankers' Association
to refrain from further forgery.
SAX QUEXTIN PRISON, Sept. 28.â
With dignified 'read, smiling and in other
ways showing every indication of happi
ness, Charles Becker, the prince of for
gers, left San Quentin prison to-day, a
free man. He has served seven years.
He stood for a moment as if to breathe
the air of liberty, then turned around,
facing the gate through which he entered
In 1897, and muttered something unintelli
gible. Captain Russell of the prison guard
awakened Becker from his reverie by a
hearty handshake and a "Now. be good,
Charley." Other prison attaches followed
suit. To each one Keeker made some
short reply, thanking them for their good
wishes and advice, as well as thanking
them for the treatment he had received
during his Incarceration.
The prison "unlock" ia at 6 o'clock each
morning, but last night Becker asked to
be let out before the other convicts. His
wish was complied with and at 5 o'clock
his cell door was unfastened. When he
came out he was attired in a gray suit,
patent leather shoes and a blatk soft hat.
When he reached the outside gate it was

The next witness was the plaintiff him
self. He told of his doings on the night
of the shooting in the Thurman house.
He' said he was in bed a little after 8
o'clock. The hat which was found in the
Thurman house was shown to Roberts
and he- said he thought it was hisT He
told of a conversation with one Hedges
the morning after the shooting. HlÂ» tes
timony was at variance with statements
which Roberts swore to immediately after
the shooting, and Judge Magulre of coun
sel for the defendant improved the oppor
tunity to try and embarrass the plaintiff.
Finally the deposition was handed to the
court. How long Roberts will be on the
stand is hard to say. He will probably
occupy the witness box all day to-mor
row.
Mark R. Plaisted, manager of the de
fendant company, was the first witness
sworn for the plaintiff. Plaisted identified

Counsel for the plaintiff, in opening: to
day, announced that Thurman would tes

Roberts was not the man who fired the

I Come to-day if you possibly can. Our great removal sale, the largest ever held on the Pacific I
I Coast, is drawing to an auspicious close. Each day the store has been crowded with customers who> e;
|l wish to get their money's worth and who appreciate the safety of dealing with a house of unques- tj
I tioncd honesty and integrity, whose record of S3 years in the lead in the music business on the Pacific . f
I Coast rightfully commands the confidence of the public. The ability of Kohler & Chase to offer the i
P best values in the market has maintained the house in the lead during these years, and when Kohler H

The currency reformers, who are called radicals,
propose to economize the use of credit under such
circumstances by the issue of an asset currency, at
THE exposition by ex-Comptroller Dawes of the
proposition submitted to the business men of
Chicago by Secretary Shaw for securing flexi
bility of the currency is very clear, and the proposi
tion itself is very good as far as it goes.
It is in brief a plan to meet the currency needs of
the country in serious emergency by permitting the
issue of bills, supplemental to the regular issues of
the national banks, which bills shall be heavily taxed,
perhaps as high as 6 per cent. It will be seen that
such issue can only be made when the interest rate
exceeds the tax sufficiently to make the currency
profitable to 'the issuing banks. No doubt in an
incipient panic such a currency may serve a useful
purpose and perhaps would check an approaching
stringency and restore confidence. It would also be
an object lesson in flexible currency that might lead
to a further application of the system.
Mr. Dawes, in his exposition at Pittsburg, takes
occasion to gird at what he calls "the radical element"
amongst currency reformers. By that he means the
men who desire a flexible currency issued to meet an
emergency arising under normal conditions and not
incident to a panic. These . radicals will accept the
Secretary's plan, but. will hardly abandon their own.
It was formulated to relieve districts remote from
the money centers. In such districts the seasonal
demand for currency varies. At seedtime and har
vest, for instance, there is a call for the use of credit
that is caused by the expanded activities of the sea
son. Farmers meet the demand of seedtime by ' a
mortgage on their future crop. Commercial men
meet that of harvest, when the crop has t//be moved
to market, by bank loans at a high rate^jf interest.
In each case it is a more costly use of credit than is
wholesome or necessary.

General Hunter, the British officer who was brave
enough to express an honest opinion that the shoot

bad, refuses either to retract or to apologize, al

THE death, by an accident, of Mrs. Elizabeth
Shields in Sacramento shocks the whole State.
She was an able woman of affairs, moved al
ways by the highest public spirit, a promoter of the
State's interests, a planter of long experience and a
wise and safe adviser as to all of the rural interests
of our people. For many years she had been a di
rector of the State Board of Trade, and her wisdom
and her work were influential in the exhibits of the
State's resources in the great expositions in this
country and in Europe. As a fruit planter she had
the genius of an international merchant added to the
experience of a producer. She was a student of her
business from the selection of soils to the selection
of a final market, and it is saying even less than is
deserved to say that no one man in California has
impressed our rural industries and our horticulture
more beneficially than she.
In her home she was the soul of hospitality, un
affected in manner and direct in speech; her acts
were dictated by a heart that knew no unkind im
pulse and a head that was wise and thoughtful. Her
death is a sore sorrow to her household and a dis
tinct loss to the commonwealth. She had just re
turned from attending, as a delegate, the Irrigation
Congress at Ogdcn, where she inspected the great
interstate exhibit of fruit, to enrich her own knowl
edge, and to receive conspicuous, honor and recogni
tion from the horticulturists of other States and the
officers of the Agricultural Department. Her instruc
tive presence will long be missed from the gatherings
of the planters and of the organizations which pro
mote the settlement and the intensive farming of our
rural districts. A mother has fallen, to whom in a
high sense the good people of this commonwealth
were the children of her wisdom and care.

PUBLIC UTILITY BONDS.
THE taxpayers should remember that just ahead
there is a cloud of propositions for the city to
yo into business. The Geary-street road is the
' beginning only, and they should insist on beginning
right. In an Eastern city the water supply passed
irom'privatc to public ownership, the bonds for that
\u25a0 m purpose resting not upon the plant, but upon the
â¢.whole city. One of the promoters of the change, in
a review of the benefits which have resulted, says:
"The water company charged for all labor and mate
.' rials furnished in tapping the mains and laying the
service pipe to the curb line; under municipal owner
ship ;hc peopije have been relieved of this expense."
. " That is an illustration of the ease with which cost
of administration may be concealed when any part
/of it is charged off to the general fund. Here we
have an apparently intelligent man who really thinks
" that the service pipe and labor furnished by the city
cost nothing, and the people are therefore "relieved
"of the expense" of making service connections. If
the proper course were pursued and the city's water
business were supported by its own income, such
â¢ concealment in the general tax levy and such self-
. deception of the people would be impossible.
To illustrate: If Oakland follow her proposed plan
' of securing municipal water works and carelessly neg
" lject to make the bonds a lien on the plant alone, as
every service connection will have to be changed to
the municipal mains, the cost to the taxpayers, to
those who do not use the water among the rest, will
1 run into many thousands of dollars, for the city will
'\u25a0 pay out cf its general fund for the pipe, the plumb
â¢ ing, the cut-off and the labor, and yet the people
.will be easily made to think that they are relieved of
that e'xpensc !
The same applies to this city, in its proposed fu
ture engagement in the business of selling water, gas
and electricity.
. The law and the charters of the two cities limit
the rate of taxation. By starting wrong and piling
up liens on the cities that shouid rest on the plants
of the business in which they propose to engage, so
. much of the limited rate of taxation may easily be
come involved as to leave less than is required for the
essential purposes of government. Therefore, good
sense and good business and good economics all re
quire that each business plant owned and adminis
tered by the city must pay its own cost and support
its own administration. In this way only can we hope
â¢ for a proper and frugal management of the plants
owned .by the city, and for the freedom of the gen
eral revenue?, to be used for the proper purposes of
government.
If it is going to pay the city to go into business the
business will support itself, of course. If it will not
pay, to make the cost of the experiment a lien on
â¢ the city is to embark upon confiscatory taxation. We
' ?.re quite sure there are enough voters to whom
these business propositions appeal to defeat all pro
posed liens on the city for business plants and com
. pel them to rest on the plants alone.
At a recent session of the Diet at Budapest, where
the enemies of the Austrian throne met to express
their rebellious thoughts, one orator, more extrava
pant than his fellows, attacked the integrity of
Francis Joseph in a bitter assault. He was hooted
from the chamber, roundly denounced and censured.
When men, fighting for liberties, can recognize the
wide difference between a wicked institution and an
innocent representative of it much may be said in
hope of their future and their success.
One of the famous track gamblers of the United
States found himself unable to wager his money on
an Eastern course the other day until he had secured
a gang of bogus hayseeds, bewhiskered, guileless
looking and noticeably and apparently fit game for
bunko men, to act as his betting commissioners. He
won an enormous sum of money and taught the
American people that only fools and the money are
v anted by the bookmakers.
A Chinese "native son" who sought admission at
this port a few days ago declared that he had thrived
and had his being in the well-known but non-existing
American city of "Chop Wood." Perhaps if he had
fallen back upon the more familiar and easily more
significant American expedient, "Saw Wood," he
would not now be on the list of those who will de
part on the next steamer for China.
HONOLULU, Sept. 22.â Judge de Bolt
last week rendered a decision under which
the various foreign insurance companies
are held liable for losses sustained in the
destruction of Chinatown by fire in Jan
uary, 1900. The companies claimed exemp
tion under a clause in their policies pro
viding that they should not be held liable
for any losses caused by an act of the
civil authorities and further claimed that
the blsr fire was due to an order of the
Board of Health under which the Fire
Department proceeded to burn several
buildings. The fire got beyond their con
trol and burned thirty acres of buildings.
In the case of a Chinese claimant
against the Manchester Insurance Com-,
pany evidence was introduced to show
that the late Fire Chief made an error
and started the fire outside the limits he
was ordered to burn, as condemned on ac
count of plague. On this showing, which
affected all the cases, Judge de Bolt in
structed the jury to find for the plaintiff.
DENVER. Sept. 2S.-The Republican

There were many charges of fraud to tne
primary election Saturday, not less than
seventy-nine of the 204 precincts sending

consequence the anti-Wolcott delegates
declined to attend the convention called

Here, then, was a case in which the employer
sought to do justice to union labor by maintaining its
equality of right, and hastened to make its purpose
known, that its union employes might be assured
of their safety and the security of their rights. This,
however, was not sufficient for those who dominate
the policy and action of the union, and they refused
to meet the company in the same spirit. Since the
resulting strike was on the property of the company
has been damaged, the telegraph wires have been cut,
its trains and their passengers have thereby been
endangered, and the third party, the public, has been
in many ways put to inconvenience and in some ways
to loss.
The employer has kept within his lawful rights and
has gone further, to show a spirit of justice and con
ciliation. In response to this position the striking
employes have relied on their power to coerce the
employer by secret and private injury, unlawful and
felonious. The third party, the public, cannot be
indifferent to this state of things. It must see that
to yield to an organization which resorts to lawless
acts to enforce its demand for discrimination in its
favor is not only to admit that the law is powerless
to protect personal and property rights, but that
those rights are held subject to the permission of
men who put themselves and their purposes above
the law. To surrender to such a policy is to abdicate
government and put the power to repeal the law in
the hands of men who operate by felony.
To cut railroad wires means., the wrecking of
trains, and that is a capital crime under the laws of
California, punishable by death. If such a felony
go not only unpunished, but be made the means of
compelling an employer to take into his employ
those who are willing to commit it, and have com
mitted it, then all protection of the law is obsoleted.
Every employer who surrenders under such circum
stances does so not for himself alone, but for every
other employer, and soon every employer becomes
the victim of force and subject to a demand that he
discharge or hire at the will of others, under penalty
of death to himself or destruction of his property.
It is well that the full meaning of this situation be
understood. This is of no less importance to the
labor of the country than to those who employ it.
The general manager of the road which is now suf
fering from such conduct of its strikers has stated
the case clearly in a circular to its ex-employes in
these terms: "We ask no ironbound contract from
our employes and do not consider it necessary to
give one. If our relations cannot be maintained by
mutual confidence they cannot be maintained at all."
The counter statement to this, made in the acts of
the strikers, is: "We base our relations on our
power to injure your property, wreck your trains and
kill your passengers."
The employe concerned, having failed to take his
appeal to the officers, who, under the known rule,
would have at once righted him and given him the
coveted promotion, but having instead attempted to
accomplish his purpose by a threat, to which, in ac
cordance with its announced policy, the company
could not submit, and remaining in that attitude, was
discharged. The strike followed, and was met by the
road by filling Sts quota of employe*' in the vacancies
voluntarily made by the strikers.
.carried it to the union, which responded with de
mands in his behalf. The president of the road, upon
the matter coming to his attention, restated the
known policy of the company, to the effect that it
forbade discrimination between union and non-union
labor. The officer who had discriminated against the
union laborer by withdrawing the recommendation
upon which his promotion depended was censured
and ordered to hereafter strictly observe the rule of
the company, which enforces equality of right and
forbids any discrimination against union labor.
THE strike on the California Northwestern
Railway has been accompanied by so many acts
of violence, not only destructive of the com
pany's property but dangerous to the traveling public
who use the line, that the officers of the company
are entitled to have their position in the affair un
derstood, to the end that blame for lawlessness may
rest where it belongs.
. An employe of the company had been recom
mended for promotion by the officer under whom he
was working. That officer, however, upon discover
ing Jhat he belonged to a union, withdrew his rec
ommendation. The aggrieved employe, instead of
making the regular appeal to the officers of the road,

the moment of its issue free from tax, but later, after
it has completed its function, subjected to such tax
as will call it in to the banks which emit it. By this
plan business men everywhere will be able to use
their credit cheaply and the tax on the issue will not
be added to the interest they pay, as in the case of
Secretary Shaw's panic currency.
It will be seen that there are wide differences be
tween the two propositions. The first. is a plan to
enlarge bank credits at a rate of interest that cannot
be less than the tax on the currency, which is to be
used when financiers are in desperate straits and are
willing to save themselves by paying a high price for
currency. The second plan is intended to flow with
the normal business conditions of the country, reliev
ing business men remote from the money centers by
giving them currency at a living rate. In other
words it is a plan for the more even and equitable
distribution of the loan fund of the country. Under
present conditions that distribution is so faulty that
when business men in the money centers use their
credit for 2 or 3 per cent those at a distance from
such centers pay 8 and often 10 per cent. While it
may not be possible to absolutely equalize interest in
all parts of the country, equality may be more nearly
approximated by a well secured asset currency.
There are other considerations, political in their
nature, entering into the problem, which are left out
entirely by the plan of Secretary Shaw. It is not
wholesome to have our system of finance and credit
always in focus as part of the pleadings of partisan
ship. In that respect the country was on the edge of
a great peril in 1896. When the causes of that dan
ger are calmly analyzed it will be found that the
attack on the national credit got sympathy and sup
port because the people remote from financial centers
were made to believe that their difficulties were
caused by lack of quantity in money, when the real
cause was a lack of distribution. They believed that
the whole country was suffering from a currency
famine, when the real difficulty was a lack of mo
bility.
It is well to look ahead and by prudent measures
make it impossible to again betray any considerable
number of the people into a like error. No one
pretends that any revenue or currency system can
be a positive insurance against panics. They are part
of the system of action and reaction from which it is
impossible that the business world shall detach it
self. But the vigor of a panic will be materially im
paired by statutory provision for a better distribu
tion of the loan fund and a more economical use of
credit.

When seen last night at the Palace. Mr.
Gage admitted that a project to t'uild
the smelter was under way and that lio
and the Mitchells had been looking over
the site near Antioch. Regarding ine
Tlans of the, enterprise he said that If the
pmelter is built it will be a big one with
ample facilities for meeting competition
with all other smelters on the coast.
The Cambrose syndicate and Stillman
products will be taken aboard the Pacific
Mail steamers at Topolobampo or Fort
Stillman, as it is now called. For several
days Gage and his principals have been
in conference with agent:-? of both the Pa
cific Mail and the Kosmos Steamship lines,
with the result, so It is reported, that a
satisfactory arrangement for bringing oi'
the copper product north to this port was
finally made with the American line.
Although the Mitchells declined yester
day to discuss their plans or even admit
that they really intend to build a smelter
in California, it was learned from a re
liable source that they have already con
tracted for the handling of the copper
product of their famous La DIcha mine
in thw? State of Guerrero, Mexico, which
can be brought to this port by way of
Acapulco, and that they have also entered
into an understanding with the Cambro.se
Syndicate of London, which owns several
valuable copper" properties in the state of
Sinaloa. Mexico, and with the Stillmr;n
Company, whose mines adjoin the com \u25a0
pany's proposed new railroad in Lower
California, to bring the ore to this city.
The Mitchells, Robert, George and
Harry, three of the seven brothers lhat
control large copper properties and
smelters in the Southwest and Mexico,
are planning to construct a big smelter
cn the bay shore, north of San Francisco,
and making this port a receiving point
for the valuable outp-lt of some of I he
Lit," copper producers of Mexico.
Tlv; tlirofc brothers mentioned have been
in San Fiancisco for several days. Stay
ing at the Palacf Hotel, where their fx e- 
qucnt iry&terious consultations with vari
oui rt'tTlt. among the latter their busi
ness agent, W. S. Gage of Xew York,
have excited much curiosity among looal
mining mtn as to the real purpose of.
their visit here, which became known yes
terday.
Gage has been In the city for the bet
ter part of a month making frequent
trips to Los Angeles to consult with the
Mitchells regarding the progress of a local
deal. It was learned yesterday that Gapo
had been negotiating for the Mitchells
for the purchase < utright or for a long
lease of the Bay Point smelter, which
was built by the defunct Copper King
Mining Company, in which Frank Gard
ner and Sir Christopher Furness of Lon
don were the principal stockholders, al
though the Bay Point fmelter would
have answered the purporos of the Milch
flls they wero compelled to abandon
their negotiations, owing to the fact thit
the property is so deeply involved in liti
gation that it purchase v. ould not be an
inviting proposition. Having failed in this
plan the Mitchells returned to their
original intention of building a smelter cf
their own and to this end Gage began
looking for a suitable site, which he
finally secured, on an option, near An
tioch
Health Officer O'Brien reported that a

The Fire Wardens also reported that

the fire escapes, and that F. H. Meyer
of Meyer & O'Brien, architects, is the

addressed ail county committees and col
lectors in the State who are getting exhib
its for the St. Louis show, and has in

hemp or ramie on the stalk,' threshed
grain, beans and seeds, broom corn, Egyp
tian corn, pampas plumes. Kaffir corn,
bamboo and everything else in this line

there is no doubt that the display of pro
cessed fruits already prepared in the sev
eral counties and by the Commissioners
will "be great, but po far the counties have
given little attention to securing- exhibits
mentioned in his letter.
Secretary Willis has already addressed
a letter to the wine men of the State. In
which he says that only fifteen wine
makers have promised to date to partici
pate in the special wine exhibit to be
made. At least thirty wineries ought to

The ordinance designed to prohibit tho
operation of compressed air cleaning ma
chines on public streets was referred to
the Health Committee. Cleveland Dam
spoke in support of the ordinance and
Julius Kahn opposed It. Comte said the
ordinance was unconstitutional, as It dis
criminated against certain machines, but
he withdrew his motion to postpone the
bill Indefinitely after Loughery's motion
to refer to the committee.
Braunhart explained that the intent of
the resolution was to ascertain If the
city had power to return the special taxes
to those who had not filed protests. Bran
denstein declared that under the State
law those who did not protest could not
get their money back.
Ordinances were passed to print order
ing grades to be changed at certain points
on Mangels and Joost avenues, Acadla,
Baden, Congo, Detroit, Jones and Fran
cisco streets.
The special levy made by the board In the
year 1002 for taxes to be used in the acquisi
tion and construction of new school buildings
and City and County Hospital has been ad
judged invalid by the Superior Court and a
judgment has been recovered against the city
by John R. Whitney for the amount of such
taxes paid by him under' protest and for tha
amount of his costs; and numerous suits are
now pending against the city by other tax
payers to recover said taxes and their coats;
also that a proposition to issue bonds for the
purpose of raising money with which to ac
quire and construct said school buildings and
licf-piuU Is about to be submitted to the voters
of this city and county, and if tho same shall
be approved by them, the moneys raised by
ths special levy aforesaid will not be needed
for f-aid purpose, and so it will not be nec
essary frr the city to Incur any further ex
penae in prosecuting an appeal from the afore
said judgment, or in defending the suits afore
snlil. or to Incur any further liability for
tho costs of the plaintiffs in said suits.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee a reso
lution requesting the City and County At
torney to render to it an opinion as to the
right of the city to refund the taxes col
lected under the special levy of 1902 for
schoolhouses and a hospital In case the
proposed issue of bonds shall be approved
by the voters, and as to the proceedings
or steps to be taken by the board for the
purpose of authorizing and directing such
refunding. The resolution recites as fol
lows:
The appeal of G. D. Clark, assignee of
Fred Letfler, the contractor for the build
ing of a sewer in Richland avenue from
South avenue to Holly ptreet, from the
assessment made by the Board of Works
for the work on the ground that it was
too low, was referred to the City Attor
ney.
Two resolutions approved in 1889 and
1S94, granting permission to John Kelso to
explode blasts on lots situated on Lom
bard and Montgomery streets and Green
wich and Sansome streets, were repealed
by the board.
Demands aggregating J5O6 SO were or
dered paid out of the urgent necessity
fund.
Three ordinances were passed to. print
declaring for assessment purposes the
length of the main track of the Central
Pacific Railway Company In this city and
county to be 2.46 miles and the \u25a0 assessed
valuation thereof $49,414; of the Pullman

<
The ordinances fixing the tax levy for
State and city purposes for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1904, at $1,405 on
every |100 assessed valuation were finally
passed by the Board of Supervisors yes
terday. The rate includes '56.1 cents for
State and 84.4 cents for city .purposes and
is based on a total assessed valuation of
$540,000,000, including the increase of 30 per
cent by the State Board of Equalization.
The ordinance declaring for assessment
purposes the length of the main track of
the United Railroads as 130.674 miles and
the valuation at $138,075 55 per mfle or
a total of $18,042,S85 as fixed by the State
Board of Equalization was referred to the
City Attorney, pending litigation on ap
peal from the Supreme Court decision
that the corooration shall be assessed by
the State, because it operates in two
counties. Assessor Dodge has placed a
much higher valuation on the company's
property.
The petition of the Pacific Humane So
ciety that the secretary of the organiza
tion be appointed Poundkeeper was re
ferred to the Finance Committee.
Supervisor Connor explained that
franchise was practically the same* as
that asked for by the Bay Shore Railway
Company, which was denied last year.
Connor said that he had never been as
sured by the signers of the petition that
complete information regarding the rail
way company would be forthcoming at
the proper time. He then introduced a
proposed ordinance covering the grant of
franchise, saying that the petitioner de-
Bired to have the matter acted upon by
the present board.
Two ordinances were also introduced
covering the proposed grant of franchise
to the Western Pacific Railway Company
to operate a steam railroad along certain
streets, as designated In two petitions re
cently filed by the corporation. The main
line of the road Is to enter the city at a
point 3665 feet distant from San Jose ave
nue and runs along certain streets to the
water front. A branch line is to run on
Sixteenth street from Kansas street to
the water front. The ordinances were
also introduced to give the present board
a chance to act on the petition, as the
bill is to be printed for ninety days.
The petitioner states that it has the
power to acquire franchises for the con
struction of a railroad from this city to
Santa Cruz. The petition is signed by
Charles F. O'Callaghan, president, and
Leon E. Prescott, secretary. It was re
ferred to the Street Committee.
The route of the main line Is thence to
run along Massachusetts, Delaware,
Maryland, Louisiana, Georgia, Twenty
fifth, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky and
other streets to San Jose avenue.
The San Francisco and Southern Rail
way Company filed a petition yesterday
with the Board of Supervisors for a fifty
year franchise to operate a line of rail
road beginning at a point on the easterly
line of Water Front street at the center
line of Twenty-fourth street, and running
thence as follows:
In a westerly and southerly direction to a

One of the best of Hoyt's plays, "A
Texas Steer," is being presented at the
California this week. The" people who are
presenting it are all clever, particularly
the principals. Their work is so good
that notwithstanding that the play is
more than twelve years old seats at the
theater are at a premium. ~ Though , all
of his plays are noted for their peculiar
vein of satire Hoyt's best : work is con
tained In the lines of "A.Texas Steer," a
fact which is evidenced by the great pop
ularity of the piece. ;

picnic.
.There will be two special military fea
tures held in the park on that day, con
sisting of an assault race and an equip
ment race for members of the company In
uniform. The Irish dances will be given
the recognition which has always been
tendered them at the K. R. B. picnics. A
separate committee will have charge of the
platform, and both the juveniles and the
adults \u25a0will be given a chance to display
their abilities, for which they will be
awarded prizes. The rifle company will
assemble at the JL R. B. Hall, on Mis
sion street, on the mÂ«rnlng of the picnic
and march to the ferry.

The musical comedy^ "The Prince of
Pilsen" continues to draw packed house*
to the Columbia. Theater. There arÂ«
many pretty and catchy tunes through
out the two acts, among them being "A
Season at the Shore"; the duet, "The
Message of the Violet," which was agaiÂ»
and again repeated: "Heldelburg"; "Pic
tures in the Smoke": "It Is the Dutch";
"The American Girl"; "The Tale of the
Sea Shell," and the march solo, "Fall
In." Trlxie Friganza Is a fascinating
widow, her dresses are exquisite and her
voice clear and expressive. Both Miss
Alrriyra Forrest Lockwood and Miss
Ruth Peebles are sweet vocalists and full
of vivacity. Jess Dandy from "Zlniln
nati" is one of the best comedians seen
here for a long time. His humor is
broad and spontaneous and he has made
qiUite a hit. Arthur Donaldson, the real
Prince, and Henry Taylor, the Lieutenant
Tom Wagner, sing well. Nick Long and
Idalene Cotton, as the French concitrge
and French 'maid, were enthusiastically
greeted last night for their clever charac
ter duet. "Back to the Boulevards."
Everything goes with a dash and swing
that ia refreshing.
Columbia.
There are few actresses on the stage
to-day that can portray the gamut of
human emotion In so artistic a manner
as does dainty Florence Roberts, the pres
ent star at the Alcazar.
Miss Roberts was seen again last even
ing as "Zaza" In the powerful play of
that name. That the audience was com
pletely carried away by the clever work
of the actress was proven In a marked
manner. For some rea3on,- the waits
between the acts were unpardonably
long and It wa3-4>ast midnight ere the
final curtain descended. Yet none of the
vast audience left the theater before the
close of the play, a sincere tribute to the
abilities of Miss Roberts.
The gaiety of the vaudeville singer in a
second rate concert hall in France was
cleverly portrayed by the star and the
emotional scenes where the broken
hearted woman parts from her lover
were enacted in an artistic manner that
brought from the audience intense silence
and then a tumult of applause.
The play of "Zaza" Is supposed to be
one that Is associated with all that Is
coarse and brutal, but In the hands of
Florence Roberts It becomes a lesson for
men and women to ponder over.
"It Is such men as you that make
women such as I am," Is the key note
of the play, and Miss Roberts brings it
out with striking reality. No matter how
Zaza may break the moral code, the
actress forces her audience to realize that
Zaza Is, after all. simply a woman, with
a woman's intense feelings, craving for
all that is better in life.
Lucius Henderson waa seen again as

The house was thoroughly appreciative
at all times, and caught up every stroke of
wit and sally of humor. "A Temperance
Town" Is produced by one of the strong
est casts ever seen at the Central. In
addition to Mr, Stockwell, Herschel May
all plays the part of "Gentleman Jack
Worth, who might be somebody if he had
a mind. to," with all the requisite fidelity,
and Eugenie Thais Lawton makes a
sweet and winsome Ruth, the clergyman's
daughter. Elmer Booth, as "Bingo, son
of Jones," gave an exceedingly, clever im
personation, and Marie Howe, as "the
woman who was fool enough to marry a
Jones," was responsible for another rich
comedy bit. George P. Webster, Â«s the
temperance druggist, "who sold liquor on
prescriptions," Walter Whlpple as the
doctor who wrote the . prescriptions and
George Nlcholls as the clergyman lead
ing the crusade against rum were very
acceptable in their respective roles. Er
nest Howell was good as "the oldest man
in town," and Edwin T. Emery. filled well
the bill of the man who ran the saloon.
Henry Shumer as the country lawyer
and Raymond Manlon as the Boston bar
rister were effective in the. courtroom
scene, and Genevieve Kane, Myrtle Vane

the promising featherweight,
axe to battle twenty rounds
in Mechanics' Pavilion to-night. This will
be their second meeting. When the lads
fought some months ago the battle ended
in a draw. Both fought furiously and put
up a magnificent battle. Yanger com

back and said he was retarded in his

Hanlon has no excuses to offer. In fact,
Eddie has never made any since entering
the roped arena. He is ambitious to rise
to the top of the ladder and believes that
by defeating Yanger he will be within a

Eddie Smith will referee the contest.
After a good deal of haggling his selection

Twelfth Night Repeated.
The Elizabethan atmosphere was well
transferred from the Greek Theater of
Berkeley to Lyric Hall last night when
at 8:15 o'clock the Everyman company re
peated its performance of "Twelfth Night.
or What V u Will." as given i.Â« the
classic temple across the bay last Satur
day afternoon.
There was gathered a goodly and repre
sentative audience and the players scored
a. magnificent success, havlns ' acquired
the lines of the immortal bard, Shakes
peare, so accurately as never to encoun
ter a stumbling Instant. Consequently
the merry comedy, with Its occasional
dramatic touches, passed off splendidly.
Constance Crawley became a favorite*
from the very first moment of her ap-^
pearance as Viola, and Beatrice Whitney"
scored not one whit less success as Se
bastian, while Ben Greet played Malvolia
in a perfectly picturesque fashion.
Clive Curry won honors for his excel
lent portrayal of the sea captain, An
tonio, and Dallas Anderson's Feste, th*
clown, teemed with Jingle, grace and flip
pant banter. To Robert Smiley must ba
given credit for the treat he gave in
the character of. Sir Toby Belch. Indeed.,
one could go through the whole cast ar.i
award to each, without exception, thÂ«
highest degree of praise and thanlca for
so complete and artistic a performance.
"Twelfth Night" will be given at a
matinee to-day and again this evening.
"The Elixir of Life."
"WTiat promises to be a. more than
usually Interesting lecture -will toe that
given by Dr. Alexander J. Mclvor-Tyn
dall, the wizard of thought transference,
at Steinway Hall next Sunday evening.
Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall has, by request,
taken for his subject "The' Elixir of LJfe."
and has promised to tell the secret of his
own marvelous power of recuperation and
rejuvenation. Whether or not there be in
the universe any power or force whereby
decay may be arrested and' death over
come is prohp.tly the next question with
which science will have to deal. Many
Christian and mental science enthusiasts
openly admit their belief in the power to
conquer the destroyer, and from the pres
ent indications of the limitless resources
of nature It seems a not unlikely contin
gency. Whatever Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall
has to say on the fascinating question
will at least be within scientific possibili
ties. This famous exponent of the mar
velous has the rare charm of adhering
strictly to scientific facts and postulates.
As there will undoubtedly be a large au
dience, reserved seats may be secured any
day during the week at "That Man
Pitts," 1008 Market street- Although tHo
lecture alone Is sufficiently attractive, Dr.
Mclvor-Tyndall will also give demonstra
tions of his unequaled faculty of clair
voyant and psychic impression.

The Orpheum bill thi3 week Is a collec
tion of vaudevllel oddities and every ona
of them Is a hit. Falke and Semen,

novelty, "In Paris," were the features
most appreciated last night.

The Minute Man easily won the $10,000
Matron f takes for colts and gÂ«ldines at
Morris Park to-day. He and his stable
companion, Panique, were favorites in the
betting, closing at six to five. . W. C.
Whitney's Ilyppocrates, second choice,
was second. Six gtjod three-year-olds
faced the starter for this event. The
Minute Man went out to make the pace
and as the field came In sight aÂ± the head
of the etretch he was leading by a length.
He gradually increased his lead to the
finish and won by four lengths.
Armenia won the filly end of the Ma
tron stakes by a head from For Luck.
Lady Amelia, the favorite, cut out the
running to the dip, where she stopped.
Probably the biggest "killing;" of the
reason was made by the DraJte-Gatca
coterie on the last race, won by Trinity
Bell. The filly was backed down from 20
to s to 1. Her recent races have been very
bad. but to-day ghe wns brimful of speed.
Lowest estimates of the â¢winnings of
Drake and Gates on the filly place them
at upward of $103,000. Summary:

CHICAGO. Sept. 28.â Dick. "Welles won
the Speed Stakes at Harlem to-day in a
common canter by a length from DeJa
goa. So far as the race was concerned
It was practically featureless, as Dick
Welles was a 1 to 6 favorite. The pres
ence of the fast colt scared all the others
out of the race. Dick Welles broke In
front and took a lead of two and a half
length In the first eighth, which he held
at all times and increased it to three
turning for home. Then Knight took
things easy, winning as he pleased. The
track was not at its beat and the time,
1:14 3-5, was not as fast as Dick Welles
has been working.
Dr. Stenhens, one of the rank outsid
ers at 20 to 1, won the Chicago Centennial
purso by two and a half length from Six
Shooter, the heavily played 11 to 10 fa
vorite, which beat By Ways a nose for
the place.
A "killing" was made on Mr. Rose in
the steeplechase, the "lepper" being
backed from. 7 to 1 down to 3 to 1. He
won easily.
The weather was clear and pleasant

The first shock came with Gregoretti's
"Largo al Factotum," after Its bewilder
lngly lively prelude. It was sung with a
surging fun that carried the house to Its
feet and found my neighbors wiping the
tears from their astonished eyes. The
barber's merry plotting and Almaviva's
delicious sentimentalizing plunged them
still further In, and by Don Basillo's "La
Calumnla"â with Cortes! as Dr. Bartolo
listening with Inspired stupidityâ they
gave up the attempt to be proper and
howled gladly with the rest of us.
I think It was the liveliest performance
of "The Barber" that I have heard. I
don't except even' that hilarious produc
tion when' Collamaiinl sported the black
beard and shovel hat of Don Basllio. "We
have never had such a Figaro as Greg
orettl to begin with. He is incomparably
more humorous than Campanari In the
part, Is even bigger, and more finely
voiced, and with as fluent and easy vocal
ism. As comedy we have had nothing
better, nor as singing. The sputtering
syllables of the "Largo" came out as
clearly as a string of pearls, every word
cut as clean as a die. So throughout, and
Gregorettl was in the best of his magnifi
cent voice last night. In looks he might
have been cut from a Goya tapestry, and
his facial play, with Its mischief, slyness,
good nature, the whole technique of the
busy-body, was humor incarnate. One
need not be told that Figaro is the bary
tone's favorite part, for he sings and
plays it that way.
Tromben's Roslna added much to the
comedy of the opera. She has a store of
unsuspected vivacity and a piquant co
quetry that makes the part on this side
well on a level with' the Figaro. Vocally,
she Is uneven. She has a. pretty voice,
an unusually fine staccato, sometimes
soloratura passages of much beauty, but
one Is never wholly comfortable about
her. In the music lesson scene Miss
Tromben's Interpolated songs were: "Una
Lezlone dl Gorgegglo," by Guagul Ben
venutl, and "Varlazlone," by Dl Frock.
The orchestra "fell down" on the count
and Miss Tromben added to the fun by
trailing a chair very vigorously across the
stage to signify her displeasure. She was
generously applauded.
Tedeschi was the Almavlva, and his
somewhat girlish voice and appearance
gave the part a peculiarly hu
morous accent. The little tenor
sang very well last night, and
the vivacity before noted In his work
came in most usefully to the acting of the
role. That very useful person, Cortesl,
was the Dr. Bartolo. and brought an in
telligence to his work that surprised those
not familiar with his career here. Cortesl
is very sure of his parts, always there,
always interested, always sufficient, and
his Dr. Bartolo ranks easily in its genre
with Gregorttti's Figaro, so far as acting
is concerned. Travagllni's smooth, fine
bass is heard to excellent advantage in
the Don Basllio role, and Miss Nettie
Deglow is pleasing as Berta. Particu
larly good la the concerted work, and
those desirous of an evening's excellent
entertainment cannot do better than hear
the Tlvoli people In this royal old comedy.

There really are a few people left In San
Francisco who have not yet heard "The
Barber of Seville." I know, for two ot
them sat next me last night at the Tivoh.
Whether the performanceâ all but bril
liant, or this part of the audience wereâ
the more amusing, it were hard to say.
My neighbors had brought along their
grand opera manners and a large Inno
cence of the libretto. They were of thosÂ»
apparently who regard opera-going as a
more or lees pleasing duty, and were
cheerfully prepared to go through with it
to the heroine's last dying screechâ for
who ever heard of grand opera where she
doesn't?
Bernard Dufrene and his work waa
thoroughly effective and artistic. The en
tire supporting company waa In keeping
with the principals and stage settings re
flect the greatest credit on the manage
ment. Miss Roberts' dresses wÂ«re a
triumph of the modiste's skill.
Belmont will retain his famous Nursery
stud, with its valuable sires and brood
mares, also a choice lot of weanlings.
Of Belmont's horses in training to be
sold, the best known are the two-year
olds Dick Turpin, Bridle Path. Fine Art,
Magistrate, Gallant, Lord of the Valley,
Orthodox, Orlza and Red Harry; the
three-year-olds Fire Eater, Flying Jib,
Lord of the Vale, Mizzen, Nine Spot and

NBW YORK. Sept. 28.â August Belmont

The sale will take place at Morris Park a

Belmont gives as his reason for thla
action that he has not the time to devote
to the running of his horses, but says he

story was first circulated to-day Belmont
was asked If it were true. He replied:
Yea, I have come to the conclusion that I
have not the time to devotÂ» to a racing stable
at present. I rarely have a chance to sen my
horses run, and I have so many corporate in

ROME, Sept. 28.â Negotiations for the

Holy See shall send as its representative
a Cardinal of the Curia. The chief diffi
culty Is that the traditions and etiquette
of the Vatican are against sending Car
dinals, except ablegates. to foreign coun
tries, and they are never sent to exposi
tions or fairs. The difficulty will probably
be overcome by sending a "Cardinal to
America in connection with church 'af
fairs and he will afterward proceed; to St.

the papacy's highest tribute, .

ried.* Miss Matilda Heyman of 774 Geary
street was a relative of Haible.
It was not Matthew Gerko who jumped
oft the cliff at Lands End last Sunday.
The first identification was made by
friends' of a man of that name, but a
later identification made yesterday morn-
Ing at the Morgue proved that the first
was a mistake and that the unfortunate
man who committed suicide in that tragic
manner was Constantine Haible. The
Identification was made by Joseph Gum
per. a neDhew of Haible. and later on
was confirmed by several other persons.
. Halble's bankbook and his will were
taken in charge, by the Public Adminis

I have never been associated with a high
school and consequently know very Kttle of
fraternities. They do. it Is true, tend to create
a narrow exduslveness. But as to curbing
them I do not think it within the power or
the Board of Education. Fraternities might
exist outside of the school and thus be be
yond tbÂ« board's Jurisdiction.
Superintendent of Schools J. W. Mc-
Clymomls, when asked for his views on
the Question, said:
I think that \u25a0 if the word "unmitigated,"
accentuating hla statement that fraternities
are nuisances, â¢was cut out of Mr.- Brown's
sermon I should say that what he said about
"f rats'* -was mainly right, ana that our views
In the main coincide. There is not, however,
at present any condition in tho fraternity ques-Â»
tlon that would warrant the Board -ct educa
tion taking any t>teps for their abolition.
That is a question that should W dealt with
entirely by the parents of the students.
The fraternity has its good features and Its
evil features. . Yet, at present, th* traternltles
Jn this hleh school do not Interfere with the
educational interests. . Still they are a danger
ous factor. They have to bo tlosely watched,
the eood In them encouraged and \u25a0' the evil
Etamped out.
I should not permit my children to Join a
high school fraternity. They do create I a
spirit of narrow ezclusiveness, but not so
much as In years gone by. There are so many
"frats" now that the spirit of bl^-otry has
been largely eliminated. There arÂ», of course,
rabid "trat" men and rabid "antl-frat" men.
These win always eslst. Still, at our last
school election It was noticeable that a strictly
non-partisan ticket won out.
This fraternity question is one that needs
a great deal of consideration before discussion
and I don't think that those in our. high
school at present would warrant much dis
cussion.
James H. Pond, principal of the Oak
land High School, agrees In the main
with the Rev. Charles PÂ». Brown, pastor
cf the First Congregational Church, In
the clergyman's criticisms of 6chool
"frata." In *the course of an interview

Four licenses were granted the South
ern Pacific Railway to-day for bars on
the ferrv-boats. C. H. Attel, J. H. For
tune James Coates, Slgmund Leckham
and 'Barbara Baumgartner were granted
licenses to conduct saloons along the San
Leandro road.' The petition of Coates was
contested and resulted in a division In
the board, in which Supervisors .Rowe,
Horner and Kelly voted for granting the
license, while Mitchell and Talcott op
posed it.
The new law will make It mandatory
upon a man wishing to get a license to
have on his petition the names of his
six nearest neighbors. There will be a
provision for the publication of his peti
tion before It Is considered by the board
and when a protest has once been made
it will have to stand upon its merits with
out opportunity to make endless amend
ments.
The trouble has been brought about
over the operation of the local option
law In Brooklyn Township, where the
matter of granting licenses to roadhouses
along the San Leandro road has been a
constant source of wrangling. The salient
features of the 61d law will be retained,
but there will be conditions in the pro
posed new law which will make impos
sible many of the arguments that can
be raised for and against tho granting
of licenses. .'I. .;*
Tho Board of Supervisors has decided
to amend the present liquor license ordi
nance, which, owing to the looseness of
Its construction, gives opportunity where
there is a clash over the granting of
licenses to contestants to make a pro
longed struggle, some such having lasted
for months. After a lengthy executive
session this morning It was decided that
it was about time to change the law.
The board referred the matter to Dis
trict Attorney Allen with a rough draft
of the chances it wishes made In the
law as a basis for a new ordinance.

The marriage happened in July, and
those who knew of it managed to keep It
quiet until a few days ago.
Miss Priestley is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. J. H. Priestley, and became en-
Pciged to a young man named Edward
Duart, son of a San Francisco commission
merchant. Last summer Duart went
East. During his absence his fiancee, her
sister Maud and Carrol J. Orton of Oak
land and a party of young friends went to
San Rafael on a little jaunt. While there,
on a wager and in a spirit of what Miss
Priestley called fun, she was married to
Orton, who Is a member of the First Cal
ifornia Regiment.
Shortly afterward her promised husband
returned, and was surprised and angered
to find among the marriage licenses in a
San Rafael paper the name of his intend
ed bride. Full of wrath, he went to Miss
Priestley's home and found her Mrs. Or
ton. She admitted the marriage and said
that It was done in a spirit of fun. Duart
failed, however, to see the fun and left
her to her husbar.d.
Sire. Orton says she still loves Duart,
although he Is now lost to her.

seven referred exclusively to the strip

Lord Alverstone confessed that the point
"troubled" him, and said that if Robinson

the Canadian case. Robinson promised to
deal with the matter at a later stage.
After luncheon Robinson became so fa

failing voice and growing pallor prompted

it is probable that he will not continue
to-morrow.

NOTE â In the above exposition of the tides
the early morning tides are given In the left
hand column and the successive tides of the
day in the order of occurrence as to time; the
fourth time column gives the last tides of the
day, except when there are but three tides, as
sometimes, occurs. The heights given are In
addition to the soundings of the United States
Coast Survey charts, except when a minus ( â )
sign precedes the height, and then the number
given Is subtracted from the depth given by
the charts. The plane of reference is the mean
of the lower low water.
Much thought has been given to seek
ing a means of separating the three so
that none of them would know when
either of his brothers was taken to the
chair or whether himself was first to go.
but the arrangement cf the prison and
the location of the death-house make
this impossible. To conduct the condemned
men through any corridor of the main
prlaqgji would undoubtedly throw the other
prisoners into an uproar. It has been de
termined, therefore, to place the three
in the successive three cells on one side
of Â«.he corridor in the death-house, nearest
the door of the execution room, and re
move them in that order to their death.
The condemned prisoners bear well the
ordeal of suspense.

ALBANY, N. Y,, Sept. 2S.â Mrs. Van
\u25a0\Vormcr, stepmother cf the 'three broth
er? who are to be executed at Clinton on
ThuVsday,- called at the executive cham
bers io-day to mak'e a final appeal in be
half of her stepsons. Governor Odell de
clined to her en the ground that he
had fully considered the case and that an
interview would be only useless pain to
both. Mrs. Van "Wormer accepted his
decision as final and departed.
Warden George Dey. of Clinton Prison,
who has the execution in charge, will not
pay, even if he has decided, in what order
the brothers are to die, but he declares
that there will be but one set of witnesses
and the work will be done with all possi
ble expedition. The witnesses have been
Instructed to meet at the Warden's of
fice at 11:15 a. m. The execution is to
take place at cf- about'noon and probably
will not consume more than twenty min
utes' time.
Governor Odell Refuses
â¢ â¬ to Interfere in the
Matter.
In the 851 tons of cargo In her hold were
110 barrels of fur skins, 50 boxes of sover

The Ventura sailed from Sydney Sep
tember 7. The actual time of the steamer
was 21 days and 20 hours from Sydney.
17 day and 18 hours from Auckland and 5
days and 20 hours from Honolulu.
On September 22, at 11:15 p. m., she ex
changed signals with the steamship So
noma. On the 24th she passed a steam
ship west bound, supposed to be the
Hongkong Maru and on the same day she
passed a French bark standing north and
close hauled.
Following are her cabin passengers:
She brought a large number of passen
gers and a full complement of freight.
Among her passengers were the Earl and
the Countess of Lonsdale. Fine weather
prevailed generally throughout the trip.
Captain Hayward reports that the steam
ship was delayed three hours at Fanning
Island in landing supplies at that port.
This was due to the fact that the light
ering facilities of the island were not suf
ficient and it became necessary, in order
to accelerate matters, for the vessel to
lower her own boats and assist in putting
the merchandise ashore. From Honolulu
the weather was fair, but the Ventura
had to combat head winds, which caused
a further delay.
Sunday night a surprise auction was
held on board the ship for the benefit of
the local charities of San Francisco,
which netted $250.
THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Ventura, from Sydney, Australia,

THREE BROTHERS
TO BE EXECUTED
â¢ TACOMA. Wa.=h.. Sept. 2S.-Hongkong
mail advices state thst a crisis has been
rt ached in the handling of the Kwong
... si rebellion - by Viceroy Tscn. Not only
arfc his 'soldiers making no headway
against the rebels and robbers, but a
large portion of the population of three
provinces is ready to r'se in rebellion
* against his power and methods of ruling.
"â¢lie" is nonsupported loyally by subordi
"naie officials and plots against him exist
4 on every haVd.
The Viceroy spent August at Nanking.
â¢where the country is in a very disturbed
condition. He has had few capable sol
diers and* complains of the character of
men sent to him from Canton and else
where. Through Kwonsr-si. Kwar.gtung
r and Szechuan eziist plots to turn the
taolcs en Viceroy Tsen and drive him
out of- office. Even Canton, heretofore
,1'rya!. contains a large number of malcon
tpnts. â¢ who are being incited to rise
against the Peking Government.
Viceroy .Tsen is cordially hated by the
* officials at <*ar:ton. who dislike him all the
more because of his great influence at
* Peking. This is partially accounted for
â¢ by the fact that he' sends much more
tribute than ir.cst Viceroys of the EOUth
c-ry. provinces. His chief supporters f<ar
jthat "the people will lose confidence in him
and so become ready for a general insur
*rcctior.ary movement. Viceroy Tsen is
said not to kijow- the meaning of the
word â¢â¢discouragement" and if supported
by capable trocps will put down his op
ponents with a har.d of iron.
Srfcial Dispatch to The Call
COLUSA, Sept. 28. â John Vincent, a
deckhand, was shot In the head here this
afternoon by C. A. Bartholomew, first
mate of the steamer San Jose. Four
shots were fired. One of the bullets took
effect in Vincent's head, but it is thought
the wound will not prove serious.
The deckhand claimed that the mate
was forcing eight men to do ten men's
work and after a quarrel quit his job.
The two met in an uptown saloon a few
hours later and the quarrel was renewed.
The deckhand threatened to "do up" the
mate. With the remark, "I'll see you
later," the mate left the saloon and re
turned in a few minutes.
"Now, if you want to do me up, step
outside," said the mate.
The deckhand started for the mate,
who pulled a r>lstol and fired". He imme
'diately ran for his boat- and hid in the
hold, where he was afterward arrested.

NEW YORK, Sept. 2Sâ Another day's liqui
<"aticn in the etock market kept apprehension
/<!lve and was aÂ« much without specific explan
ation as that which h*Â« gone before. .The liqui
dation wae mostly for small nmo'unts and
<-Â»me from all quarters. There was a large
accumulation of these *fc!limr order* oyer Sun
day and there tfctmed- to be a good deal of
Veiling out by commission houses whose no-.
; tiflcatlcns to cuitomers for additional margin
hkd been ignored over * Sunday. All the for
eign rontfrs which bold any appreciable quan
tity of American. securities, also flRured in the
k :':-re. All news of a favorable tenor was ig
nored, and the demand practically paralyzed
except for occasional buying by uncovered
t.horts. Tiie buyer who form the complement
JfOT every nc-lier seemed to wait for stock's to
t>Â« .offered to him and made no bid. There
Â»eÂ« a .considerable amount of this sort of
buyilir which waa traced .with confidence to
'poamat the largest banking Interest*, who-eat
\u25a0 jt;9edtherr.selvÂ«B v.-|th this measure of nupport
' for the market. It was quite ineffective in
â¢ x-reventinr the sharp downward course of
lÂ»riceÂ» : although tt may have, prevented the
.demoralization which was feared.

. *>rf>Â£ thrir record price* by wid* margin*, the
Â».>mmon touching 15. the preferred 59 and the
bonds 67*4,.
' The rK^* u re upon the last named was es
pecially urgent and vigorous. The only at
' t~TQ.pt to explain this ei-'iling was a rumor that
!v came from that part of the membership of
the indicate underwriting: the stock â¢ conver
sion. Â»hich_ plan was dosiicr.ed to avoid the
KÂ»mis of tlu> extension of the syndicate.
The- local traction stocks were another cen
, Â»Vr of weakness led by Metropolitan Street
lUilway. which' fell to within a shade of par.
â¢">.!* weakness was variously explained as due
.'to .the liquidation forced by over-extension In
other quarter* and by unfavorable internal de
velopment*. " Part of the *ellins in this stock
â¢was Â«sÂ«id ,*jo r-ome froni .Philadelphia, which
was also k."J enormc;iÂ» seller of Fenn&yivania.
The -jiressure upon Pennsylvania carried it
<5<swri 4Vi at the last and was thÂ» factor in un
tVuiinjr'the close. Previous* to this last slump
in Pcjnsylvania there had. been quite an ef
fÂ«:ctix-e rally all round <lue to the apparent
< \u25a0 rsntit.n to the liquidation in the. United States
Steel- Â«tocka. AmalBamau-d Copper was an
<,ther â¢took which was severely handled and it
was eufpected that the abandonment of the
plan fot an upward bull campaign was th<;
Â»ause of this selling. The t.ews of the day
was not an -influence. A batch of railroad'
fÂ«rainj;Â» for August which shoved mostly in
rr<asn were Ignored. Money rates handened
both on call Â».ud time, but pave no indica
tion of etrlngency In any case. The closing

mediately after the opening, buying by scat

The Frenchman and a companion in

Nelson went to the door and ordered tho

him with a knife. Nelson seized a chair
leg and struck the Frenchman on the
head. The man walked away and Nelson
supposed the disturbance was over.
About fifteen minutes later he heard his
wife scream again and on investigation
found the Frenchman trying to enter the
house. He again attacked Nelson and in
the fight that iollowed Nelson struck_liim
a severe blow on the head with a club.
After telling his story to the officers to
day Nelson was released upon his own re
cognizance.
In defending: himself from the attack of
the man, who had been carousing at a
neighboring house, Nelson struck his as
sailant on the head with a club, frac
turing his skull. The Frenchman died at
the County Hospital to-day without re
gaining Consciousness. The man was first
taken to the County Jail, when supposed
to be in a drunken stupor. It was subse
quently discovered that his condition was
due to a blow on the head and he was ta
ken to the County Hospital.

A circular was issued from the office of
Manager James A. Agler of the Southern
Pacific Company yesterday announcing
the resignation of C. C. Sroufe as super
intendent of tho Tucson division of the
road, which position he held for a num
ber of years, and the appointment of his
successor in the person of T. R. Jones, as

W. R. Scott, who is at present with the
Colorado and Southern Railway.

Jones has served the company for nearly
thirty years and was for several years as
sistant to the late John B. Wright. The
changes will take effect on October 1.

When she began to struggle he reached
up and tore down a clothes line In the
kitchen, with which he bound her hands
behind her. Then he picked up a dish
cloth and tied it about her face, muffling
her screams. She is positive that before
he locked the bedroom door he turned on
both gas jets. She said that he sat her
in a chair after taking her into tho bed
room and that when she attempted to
arise after he had left the room she fell
unconscious. She did not remember any
more until she found herself in bed.
The police are inclined to attach little
importance to the case and regard it
merely as a crazy freak on the part of the
ex-husband. They are not making much
of an effort to apprehend him, but if he
is found he will be taken into custody. He
has been employed as a bootblack at a
barber shop at 116 Sutter street, but did
not work yesterday, nor had he been seen
there. He has a mother at Redwood City
and the police believe it is possible that
he may have gone there.'
Miss Hassell was entirely recovered

Since then she claimed she had seen her
former husband only once, when she was

but went away without attempting to
speak to her.
When he sought her out yesterday

said that in the summer of 1902 she ran
away from her mother's home and took
up her abode with a Mrs. Marittie at 33
Clarence place. One day shortly there
after she met Mondragon at a picnic and
after a short courtship married him in
the month of July of that year. She said
she only lived with him for two months
and then left him because he did not
provide a home for her. In September
of the same year she claims the mar

The plan is to name them after States
and Territories and persons who have
gained national fame. As the State
Board of Examiners refused to audit cer
tain bills of the commission Incurred for
the entertainment of the Presidential
party during Its recent visit to the park,
the members of the commission voted to
contribute pro rata toward the settlement
of the indebtedness. State Highway Com
missioner Ellery made a report to the
board relative to the oiling of the park
roads and on his suggestion It was de
cided to experiment with oil on two quar
ter-mile sections of road in different parts
of the valley with a view of determining;
whether it will pay to use oil on all the
roadways.
As the lease on the hotel in the valley
expires in a few months, the Commission
ers decided to ask for bids for a new
lease at a meeting to be held on October
15. All bidders will be required to be
present in person, as it Is the desire of
the board to inquire of them just how
they purpose to serve the public. Plans
are under way for a new telephone sys
tem in the park.
The guardian of the park was Instructed
to make an investigation Into the feasi
bility of creating a new water supply
by tapping a stream near Glacier Point.
The board also decided to build a bridge
across the Merced River near the Lick
house and to adopt a system for renam
ing all the big trees.
The Yosemlte Valley Commissioners held
a meeting yesterday afternoon, at which
there were a number of women, headed
by Mrs. J. C. Hutchlnson. who submitted
a protest against what they termed the
Indiscriminate cutting of the underbrush
and small trees in the vallev. It was
explained to them by the members of the
board that this work is being donÂ© under
the direction of experts in forestry for
the preservation of the larger trees.

The four men left the saloon together,
and after they had cone about half a
block Plothow said that onÂ© of them
grabbed hold of hi9 coat. He . turned
round to ask what was tho matter, when
another seized him by the shoulders and
the third grasped him by tha throat The
one who had hold of hia coat struck him
on the eye, knocking him. down and ren
dering him unconscious.
When Plothow recovered consciousness
the three men. had disappeared and ha
discovered that hid gold watch ar.d chain,
valued at CS5, had been stolen. Plothow
notified the two policemen of tha robbery
and from the description he gave they
arrested Haskins. Lynch and Grosacup at
their homes. They were positively Identi
fied by Plothow and wero booked on tha
charge of robbery. They all deny that
they had anything to do with tha robbery.
Plothow, about midnight, went into
William Engel's saloon at 1S02 Fol3oia
street to have a drink and met the threa
defendants. They had several drinks to
gether and. finally Engel told them, that
they must leave, as he wanted to ciosa
up the saloon.

O'Keefe had made a will which was de
posited in Hongkong. In It he left quite
a large amount to his daughter, Mrs.
James F. Butler, In Savannah, but his
first wife was entirely ignored.
In the will George P. Lamnert was ap
pointed executor, and at the present time
Charles Elvy, formerly of San Francisco,
is assisting in the management of the va
ried interests. '
According to the German law. a man
must be missing and unheard qf for a pe
riod of three years before he can be con
sidered dead, and before his estate can be
administered upon. No settlement or di
vision can, therefore, take place until
May 10. 1904, that date being three years
from the time O'Keefe was last Been
alive. The Savannah widow expects to
claim 60 per cent of the estate, and with
that object in view Hartridge will again
proceed to the islands early next year to
protect his client's interests.
This spring his widow decided to look
into her interests, and Lawyer Hartridge
went out there to see how matters stood.
He found that O'Keefe. during his resi
dence In the Carolines, had taken unto
himself two native wives, the result of
these unions being eight children. Hart
ridge stated that O'Keefe's estate
amounted to somewhere in the vicinity
of $1,500,000, the property all being pro
ductive.
O'Keefe rapidly built up a biff fortune,
principally by trading 1 in copra, and made
investments both in the island of Yap
and also in Hongkong.
Early in May he visited the latter
place and started to return to his island
home on one of his own sailing ships.
That was the last ever heard of him.
Neither O'Keefe nor his vessel ever
turned up. In June, 1900, he sent his
wife in Savannah $1500. which was the
final remittajice she received from him.
although previously he had kept her well
supplied with funds.
W. C. Hartridge, who went to the Caro
line Islands last May in the interests of
Mrs. Catherine O'Keefe, widow of David
D. O'Keefe, was among the passengers
arriving on the Doric last night. O'Keefe
was known as the King of Yap. He left
his wif$Â»and daughter in Savannah in the
early seventies and started for ' the
islands, but was wrecked on the island of
Yap.
He was the first white man the natives
had ever seen, and he impressed them to
such an extent that they treated him with
the greatest possible reverence and finally
called him King, by which title he was
known throughout his adopted home.

A rather unique service took place at St.
Stephen's Church on Sunday morning, it
being the occasion of the Institution of
Rev. Ernest Bradley as rector of the
parish. Right Rev. William F. Nichols,
.Eishop of California, was the instltutor
and preacher. During the office of insti
tution Arthur F. Price, the senior warden,
handed the keys of the church to the new
minister, acknowledging him as the priest
and rector of the parish. Bishop Nichols
also presented to him a Bible, prayer book
and the canons of the Episcopal church,
as his rule of conduct and discipline.
After the institution the new rector pro
ceeded to the altar and celebrated at the
holy communion.
Rev. Ernest Bradley was called to St.
Stephen's last spring to take the place of
the late Dean Lion, and Sunday morning
was his formal institution. In the after
noon at 4 o'clock the church was crowded
to the doors to witness the confirmation
of thirty candidates, presented by Mr.
Bradley. *
The class, the girl candidates of which
made -a very pretty appearance in white,
marched into the church, preceded by the
crucifer of the Sunday-school. Master
Harold Forman, a member of the class
and boy singer in St. Luke's Church, sang
an offertory solo in a very Impressive

AT ST. STEPHEN'S
Chin Leong Po was called and testified
that the placard, which was prepared by
the Janitor of the Six Companies, was
aimed at highbinders committing subor
nation of perjury in the case and was In
effect in the interests of justice.
Dr. J. E. Gardner, Chinese interpreter
and Inspector in the Federal service, and
Dong Gong, interpreter In the police
courts, both testified that the alleged of
fending part of the placard read:" "Xow
men of all classes must not cover or abet
him, and these who secretly or by dark
means aid him to gain freedom are really
of the. same class and should be severely
dealt with according to law."
The Judge said that nothing expressed
in the statute regarding- contempt applied
to the case, but Attorneys Barnes and
McCloskey claimed that there was lnher
e.nt' power in the judiciary to punish for
contempt although the particular act was
not incorporated in the statute, and the
Judge said he would reserve his decision
on that point. '
The case of Woo Shuck was transferred
to Polie Judge Fritz's court and the pre
liminary hearing will commence this
morning.
They were represented by Attorney
Carr, who entered a demurrer claiming
that nothing had been shown prejudicial
to the interests of the defendant or that
any one had been Intimidated by the pla
card. He also said that the contents of
the placard had an entirely different
meaning from the interpretation given
them, by the attorneys for the defendant,
W. S. Barnes and H. H. McCloskey.
The presidents of the Chinese Six Com
panies and their secretary. Chin Leong
Po, who were cited to appear before Po
lice Judge Cabanlss to show cause why
they should not be punished for contempt
of court, were present In court yesterday.
The contempt consisted in posting a pla
card on the walls of Chinatown making
threata against any one, white or yellow,
who would assist In tho defense of Woo
Shuck, charged with complicity in the
robbery at Wo Sing's 6tore, 726 Dupont
street, on the night of May 30, 1902.
. In reply to a question by Mr. -Wood
\u25a0vrorth. .the witness said that he and
Beavers and Machen understood in their
'discussions of the device that it was in
tejnded primarily to *act as a check on. the
mail collectors. " .
Mr. Knight then '"made an .elaborate
argument, in which he attacked the va
lidity of the Indictment, and contend^
that !t failed to ch^ge* any crime against
his client, Erwin, because it did not
charge that he know that the Govern
ment was about to Jfej defrauded. Mr.
Wood worth in reply rr-ad from portions of
the indictment ,wh.erein whore set forth
the words, "Knowingly, corruptly and
fraudulently."
Judge Heaeock said that he would look
over the authorities' in the morning and
\u25a0would give his opinion in a day or two.
*Â£r. Erwin was. recalled by Mr. Knight
and stated that, there y>re TS.ooo letter
boxes altogether in â¢us.t^in the. United
Btates. He did not consider. 'the charge
for the device an unreasonable one. Hfe
had learned within two or three days that
the New Zealand Government had sent a
letter to the Postal Rcvio? Company ask
ing for estimates on finishing the de
vires in lot* of 200, 500 and 1000.
"I have no doubt, as to Its utility," re
marked Judge Heacook. "It is a check
upon the collectors and obliges them to do
their duty. It Js a very important check
Indeed, beneficial aUke to the Govern
ment and the citizens."
JUDGE FAVORS MACHINE,
" To" establish the urility of the device'
end thus offset tnc contention of - the
prosecution that the Government xva^ de-.
Jrsiuded when it i>IUd Richardson ar.<i'his
associates for the use ofQ'.t. Mr. Knight
placed William H. Smythe on the stand.
Iilr. Smythe is a patent solicitor of many
years' stancVvng and he Qstified that he
knew of certain, patented articles whicti
were -manufactured at "a cost of $3 that
â¢were sold in the marke^^t from $30 to $33.
Others at a ccsf of f 40 sold foPas high as
COO and $23?, ar.Â» ethers-' costing $230 that
Bold for f5T5. He had brcn for twenty
years a reader of â¢the Patent Gazette, a
magazine published by the Government,
and had never seen an account of a .simi
lar invention. 0
One of the patent letter boxes was
placed on the Judge's -table and Mr.
Woodworth showed that .the ti.me indi
cator did not. reveal any more Information
than was conveyed by the printed card
schedule of collections fixed under glass
at the front of the box, but this statement
was contested by Mr. Knight, who con
tended that it also showed whenever a
carrier neglected to take the mail out of
the box. Mr. Wood worth then asked
Patent Expert Smythe whether he had
ever heard of J.ohnson's tinvT) indicator
and Colburn's time card, and iir. Smythe
replied that he had not.
As an Index of the" popularity of the
r.ew invention among 'business men,
Henry E. Poehlman, a, real estate and in
surance broker, was called by Mr. Knight
and said that the device was -of great
benefit to the merchants and men in
other business by advising them whether
their letters if dropped Into a certain
box at a certain time- would reach a cer
tain outgoing train or steamer.
"UTILITY OF DEVICE.
Mr. Woodworth. by his . questions,
eeeroed to "be aiming at an attack upon
the utility of t-he time .indicator. He in
einuajed that a device to accomplish the
came result could be made at a cost of
not more than DO cents. The witnesses
en this branch of the 'ca.Â«e were' quietly
quizzed by the United States Attorney.
STUBS, when Mail -Collector Walter J. Pat
terson said that prior to. the adoption of
the new invention people used to ask
Questions as to -the times of collection,
etc.; and that after Its adoption "we hold
our peace," Mr. Woodworth sarcastically
remarked that the machine was good for
one thingâ that is to keep the mail col
lectors from weafc'irg themselves. by con
verging. â¢
Mr. Pattelson explained tYiat.the device
prevented the collectors from opening the
b^xes before th<? regular times and de
tected them v.hc^i they omitted to maOe
a collection promptly. ' This testimony
vas corroborated Â° bj^ that zf. A. E.
JCa'thanson. another mail collector of long
experience. He said that the patent had
proved to be a great convenience to the
pub'lic as well.
