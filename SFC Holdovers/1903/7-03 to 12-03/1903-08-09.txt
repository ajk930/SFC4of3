ODE TO THE
SUMMER GIRL
Ah, dearest one and fairest one
Whose beauty sways us all,
No lovlier thing beneath the sun
Holds any heart in thrall.
From dainty head to slender foot,
Along thy lissome length,
As flower that springs from gracious root,
JLo ! purity and strength.
Out-doors or in, the motive thou
Of summer's joy and sport.
Out-doors or in, before thee bow
U/ye vassals of thy court.
OK! radiant vision ojf deligHt,
Once more thy flag unfurl*
EartH hath no rarer, sweeter sigHt,
Than justâ tHe Summer Girl.

fHE hot, spiritless
night was lighted
by a copper moon
whose rays were
filled, with uncan
ny flgurts of mias
ma arising: over
the -swamp that
stretched away southward from a cabin
on a knoll, from the muffled distance
came the sound of the pile drivers sink
ing timber on top of timber Into the
marshy soil of the swamp. It was the'
night shift at work; the construction of
the railroad was being pushed as rapidly
as the situation would allow and men
there were yielding up their lives every
day to the insinuating rrasp of malaria.
On the steps of the cabin sat a young
woman, fating- with hollow eyes toward
the moon, while from beyond In the deep
er darkness of the cabin's interior came
sonorous sounds from the nostrils of a
man in drunken sleÂ»p.
At last the young: woman arose and
walked across the yard to the dense
shadow of a palm, and she limped with
pain. At the roots of the palm she sat
down and rested her chin In her small
hands. The sound of a llrht footstep
reached her ear a moment later, but she
did not raise her head until her name
was calUd, dose to her ear.
"Gus," she murmured. "I've been hopln'
ye'd come, though I don't reckon It's
haxu.y right to do IL But how csr
body help It, Gus, when he does the
he does?"
UNDER THE
COPPERMOON
came to him. '
There was a moment of fasclnatloft.
And. as the block started on it3 return,
its swift and powerful descent. Gua pur
posely tripped himself and pitched for
ward between the grooves directly in the
path of the block. But at the same In
stant there was a sudden movement on
the part of Jim. His lank body shot for
ward, with outstretched arms and hands
catchlnr against the breast of Gus and
shoving him far back from the path of tnÂ«
descending: block.
There was a muffled thud when the
follow block struck and the trunk of
Jim's body was a mass of crushed flesh
and bone. Gu's regained his feet and
sprang forward in time to catch Jim's
drooping head in his hands.
"Gus. ye're all right." murmured taa>
lips of the dying man. "Te're flttln* for
Mag. an' I ain't. Tell her 1 said for y*
to marry to-morrow. No use o* waitin'â
forâ for I reckon- Mag's hungry now."
Jim's eyes glazed and his Jaws became
set. And Gus held his head in silence
whi!e the exowd gathered around.
But Jim had lain in his grave on the
hillside a full year before Gus delivered
his message to Mag. â¢
may not be rirht for me to be steppin'
in between a man an' his wife an' show
in* ye mv love the way I do. But ye
warn't mated right, Mag, an' Jim knows
it as well as you do. But. little 'un. what
I'm thinkln' about is, where's the help?"
"That's so. Gus. Where's the help?
I took Jim for better or for worse, an' if
It's worse, I reckon it ain't for me to
complainâ that is. to anybody but you,
Gus."
*"l notice ye're ltmpin', Mag. More o'
Jim's meanness, I reckon?"
"Nothin" much. Gus. Iâ Iâ"
"I reckon ye'd as well tell it, Magâ to
me." ' '
"Yes, I know. But Jim didn't know
what he was doln* hardlyâ an'^the table
was rickety, anyhow."
"Jest about made ye run over the table,
I guess. But, Mag. I been wonderin'lf
ye had any r:...ons. I know Jim ain't
struck a lick sinceâ I mean, In the last
two weeks."
"I know what ye mean. Gus. Ye mean
since ye give me the last money., An'â
an' I'm obliged to say it's so. I don't
know how, but somehow he found out I
had the money an' he wanted to borrow
it. an' I didn't see any way to refuse
him." .
"I reckon not. He always gets enough
to get drunk on. But what I want to
know is how long ye've been without any
thing to eat?"
Mag gazed for a moment toward the
copper moon in the heavens, and was
silent, the muscles of her gaunt face
twitching slightly at a suggestion of the
hunger she felt.
"Mag, I reckon ye'd jest as well tell
me."
"I know, Gus. I knowâ butâ " Mag
dropped her face into the crook of her
arm and began to cry-
Gus sat on the ground a few feet away,
gazing upon the woman, with ' all the
love and yearning of his soul In his eyÂ«s,
and allowed her to cry in silence. But
at last he spoke again.
"I know, it's, been long enough," ' h.e
said, fingering a gold piece he had
taken from, his. pocket. '
Mag. looked toward him. "Since yes
terday morning, Gus, an' I reckoned I'd
die this time.' An', though you'd hardly
like to hear it, I was kind o' hop^n' , I
Â¦would."
"Mag!" Gus was on his knees and
had seized the girl's hands. "I was
afraid it was comin' to this again, an*
I tried to get back soonerâ an' I know
now I should have sent Tom Bolus in
my place."
"No, you shouldn't, Gus. What right
had ye to be sendin* any one in your
place to earn your money, Jest bo ye
could be here on my account. Some
times I 'most forget, Gus." Mas; nod
ded toward the house and slowly with
drew her hfuida from the man's grasp.
But Gus caught one of them again
and pressed its slender fingers down
upon a piece of money he had drawn
from his pocket.
"Mag." he said, "it don't look like
it would be wrong for me to take ye
in my arms an' kiss ye Jest once. But
then I reckon it would be, since ye're
Jim's by the law an 1 the gospel, sich
a* it was.". . .
â¢ There was stlence for a few mo
ments a,fter this speech. Then Mag
reached out and laid her hand on
Gus's arm.
'.'When I'm dead, Gus," she 6aid,
"won't ye come an' kiss me,
body '3 loohin'? There'll be no Iii*m*
then." . Â¦ . Â¦-â¢':':â¢:Â¦;;
"Mag. Mag;!" Gust had seized her by
the shoulders) in a frenzied grasp.
"Don't ye talk about dyin", or I'll kiss
ye to death right here now in spite &
Jim an' the law and the gospel."
Mag drew quickly away from him. ;
and he. too. shrank back and arose.
Both realised how unsurmountable -was
the barrter between them. And Mag
retreated slowly toward the cabin. Just
as a man staggered to the doorway from
the dark Interior and called her name
gruffly.
The next day Gus exchanged places
wtth Tom Bolus. Tom had been set
ting poles for one of the pile drivers,
and Gus had been captain of the team
gangs hauling supplies from the coast.
Among the supplies of the commissary
was an abundance of red liquor, and it
was this which kept Jim from working,
as long as he could obtain a cent other
wise with which, to buy whisky. And Gus
was surprised, on entering â¢ the commls
earv at noon, to see Jim in the act of
throwing . upon the counter the gold coin
which he had pressed into Mag's hand the
night before. '
Gus turned on his heel, and. taking up
his unopened dinner pail, carried it to
Jim's cabin and thrust it Inside the door
to Mag. Returning, Gus met Jim, and the
latter flourished a long, black bottle be
fore his face.
It was three days before Jim showed
himself about the works again. .Then he
came lounging about the machine where
Gus was working. There was a leÂ«r In
Jim's eye which made ' Gus a little
nervous. He did not feel altogether in
nocent, and once or twice he felt like
telling Jim plainly that he loved his wife,
and that one or the other of them must
die. But as each thought of this kind
arose Gus inwardly cursed himself and
clinched his teeth' with determination.
But Jim remained, apparently only watch
ing the work of the pile driver, which
Gus was operating.
The afternoon was growing gray In the
swamp, and the time of the day shift
was drawing to a close. Still, Jim stood
on one side of the great pile driver and
Gus on the other. His thoughts took. a
new turn as the day's end drew nearer.
Mag was irrevocably tied to that clod of
earth Before hlmi and she could never be
near to him than now unlessâ Jim died.
Gus throttled the thought of possible
murder that, unbidden, seemed to arise
for a moment in" his heart. He glanced
quickly up at the rising follow block,
that great, square lump of steel weigh
ing two tons or more and a new thought
THE SUNDAY CALL.

"Good God:
"Her keel is of solid gold. You read the
story In the papt-r the other day staling
that the Virginia drew only fifteen feet of
water. Well, that was true. Gold Is
nearly twice as heavy as lead, a g>>k!cn
keel is only half the size of a leaden cue,
and Its resistance to the water is far loss.
Consequently a boat with such a keel U

sold all my property and turned it into
gold to make a ke.-l for the Virginia. Will
you Htay here and protect the wreck un
til we can get the wrecking apparatus?'
"I will, sir; I will."
Three hours later the work on the yacht
had proceeded far enough
to make certain the saf
ety of the gold, and Stan
hope set off to the home
of Miss Wentworth.
where he found her none
the worse for htr cold
bath.
"I asked my question at
the proper time. Virgin

blundering of that boat
robbed me of my answer.

at him. "No," she bald.

the United States gunboat which had
quickly d.FOfrsed the fleet and taken

As the boat went down like a stone.
Stanhope clasped Virginia in his arms
and sprang overboard, and in a few mo

HOW THE RACE WAS WON.
By Crittes&den Marriott.
fâ Vâ â^3 â Sfriy- She lived there
with her aunt in a tiny two-room house
and sewed from morning until night,
sometimes far Into the night. Betty
didn't mind work; there was something
she did mind, though.
It never occurred to the Arcadians, for
their hearts are kind, that they made a
pincushion of Betty, and that the pins
they eternally stuck into her, really
meant for pleasantries, were, to a soft
eyed, tender, sensitive, brown little thing
IIk<" Betty; actual stabs.
Betty tried hard not to mind. On
her twenty-eighth birthnight the did a
courageous thing. At midnight she ttole
from the house to bury something very
precious to her. In the blackness about
her the wind shouted and jeertd, the ruin
dashed in her face. Half-laughing, IiafT
sobblng. she put the beautiful thing ueep
lp a heaped up mound of wet, dead
leaves, Groping, her hand touched some
thing that she knew to be a late white
rose, and with shaking fingers ehe laid it
on the funeral pile.
fide nee had had a depressing effect on
this side of the water, where the new de
fender, the Virginia, had done nothing to
show that she was greatly superior to the
Columbia.:
Stanhope had been readily admitted to
the Yacht Club, and his boct, constructed
by the famous old designer, had been ac
cepted as the defender of th* cup. Extra
ordinary pains had been taken to keep
her lines stcret. The shipyard where she
Was built had been guarded day and night
by armed men, and she had been
launched "in petticoats," which concealed
her hull.
With a boat that drew only fifteen feet
of water, which everybody had declared
would cansize in the first puff of wind.
Stanhope ; won the first two races in a
walk-over. - . Â¦:
The result of the third face seemed so
absolutely certain that Stanhope invited
Miss Wentworth and h*r chaperon to be
on board durlngr it. It was not in ac
cordance with racing customs to have
any one besides the officers and crew
aboard at Â«uc;h a time, but the superior
ity of the Virginia was so evident that it
seemed Impossible' for harm to result. .
Ami none did result until after the race
was won. Ae the Virginia glided smooth
ly across the 'line, four miles ahead of
her outclassed rival. Stanhope turned to
Miss, Wentworth. "Are you carried away,
Virginia?" he asked. The girl turned to
him, joy in hie triumph flushing her face,
but before she could answer a cry .of
terror,, arose. The excursion fleet, wild
with excitement over, the unprecedented
triumph of the American, had broken
through Uhe guard lines. *he next in
stant came a grinding crash and the pad
dle wheel of a gigantic ferryboat went
tearing across the yacht, ripping her
utern'to pieces and pushing her beneath
the? water. " â¢ . ',
The~ suddenness of the calamity added
to its awfulnejs. One moment the beauti
ful vessel with towering masts and bel
lying canvas was there, the next, only a

regarding the

risk It, 1 can assure you of victory a* cer
tainly as any human event still in the fu
ture can be assured. But it will cost a
.great deal."
"Never mind the cost. I have the nerve,
I believe, and I have the monÂ«yâ that ls.
I have anything within reason."
"Ah! But perhaps you'll think that this
isn't in reason. Willâ and canâ you riak
seven million dollars on the race with
the -certainty . of winning, unless some
thing altogether unforeseen should oc
cur?" \
"Seven millions! Good God! How can
you possibly spend seven millions?"
"I eald risk, not spend. And the risk
will be .very small. Nearly all of the
money will be restored safe and sound
less the cost of the yacht, crew and so
forth, say half a million. But the seven
millions I must 'have' in coin, or, better
still, In bars of solid gold. Will you risk
it?"
Drops of sweat stood, on Stanhope's
forehead, but he answered gamely:
"How toon do you want the money?" i
"Eight or nine mouths from now will
do." ;,
"Very well, you shall have it. Now ex
plain your plans to me." And under his
breath Stanhope murmured: "I wonder
whether this sort of thing is romantic
enough to suit her?" Â¦
This remark was unwise, unless Miss
Wentworth wished to invite what fol
lowed. For no one had ever accused
Stanhope of being backward where wom
en were concerned. Besides, he was very
much In love with MIrs Wentworth. > So
he Instantly turned, bent over the. girl,
so that no one else might hear, and' whis
pered: "Will you love me If I carry It off,
Virginia?" Whereupon Miss Wentworth,
with a sudden heightening color, turned
quickly aside and made a remark to a
girl companion.
But the question, oWce asked, had to be
answered sooner or later. .. -
An hour later he was closeted with Nell
Burke, the famous yacht designer, but
when he had finally poured forth his am
bition the designer's face grew serious. He
drew a sheet of paper toward him and Be

"I don't like the name of Nebuzaradon

named for your father's uncle, and he
was seventy years old then, and immense

"Yes. and be is ninety-four years old
now, and still immensely wealthy. And 1
am forced to sign myself *N. Nye.' and
am the butt of all sorts of ridiculous
jokes on account of my name. I will not
write out that name, 'Nebuzaradon,' and
of course I don't want business men to
call me 'Don,' as you do. One thing I am
resolved uponâ I shall marry a girl with
an ordinary name, Mary or Elizabeth or
Ann."
His mother laughed, teaslngly.
"It will be Just your fate to fall in love
with a girl named Clytemnestra."
Don groaned dismally.
"1 wouldn't go within ten miles of her.
and if I'm a lonely bachelor ail my life,
you will know it is because no woman win
marry me on account of my horrible
name. Let's change the subjectâ the peo
ple who have bought the Parker place are
fixing up the grounds beautifully; I no

"Yes, I called there to-day. Mrs. Holmes
told me that her daughter had charge of
ell that. She le just home from college,
and is a very charming girl. I'd like you
to go with me to call on them. They are
likely to prove a very desirable acquisi
tion to the neighborhood."
"I hope the girl's name isn't Clytemnes
tra," growled Don.
"Really, Don, dear. I didn't question her
as to tier name, but her mother called her
â¢Happy.* "
"Happy, Happy," he repeated, "that is
a very pretty name. Happy Holmes. That
is a particularly pleasing combination. I
have no objection to calling on a girl with
bo attractive a name.'
During the lonr, bright cummer Don
and his new neighbor were together al
most constantly. Happy's name was ad
mirably appropriateâ the sunsmne in j.er
teemed to shed its brightness on all
around her. Ehe had a sweet, frank na
ture and made no concealment of her
pleasure in Don's society. The hitherto
unimpressionable Don was soon deeply in
love.
"I'm thankful har name isn't Clytem
r.cstraâhow mother would enjoy teasing
me. Tbtre couldn't be - nicer name than
Happy; and a more lovely girl doesn't
exist."

it over and over againâ Don. Don. Don

and from that it was not at all a difficult
on the snb'ect of names. "Have you no
name other than Happy?" he asked. < -;
"My middle name is Ness." she replied.
"I was named by my mother's. aunt; who
Is very wealthy and promised to make me
her heir If I were given her name."
"You should be thankful your aunt had
so Dretty a name," he remarked, en
vloualy.
Don's eyes were fixed on a brown lock
that curled against Happy's white neck,
mid he failed to notice the painful flush
that crent over her round cheek.
"Haven't von a middle name?" ehe
asked presently.
"No." Don answered, shortly, and ab
ruptly changed the subject.
When a man really cares for a girl so
small a thine as an undesirable name
counts fnr little. Don finally conquered
the timidity that assailed him whenever
he thought of himself ae "Nebuzaradon,"
and was insanely happy over the result. .
"Don, dear." said Happy, a few days
after the announcement of. their, engage
ment, "do you know what first attracted
me to you?"
"My good looks, I suppose,"' answered
Don, confidently.
"Nothing of the kind.^you vain crea

"Then you are willing to a-Jmit that

"I admit nothing. He didn't knowâ he

"Yes.' I do, dear Don," cried Happy,
laughing hysterically, "and the fates

That evening Don questioned his moth

"Happy, I have a dreadful confession

Happy was silent.
Arcady didn't know that a romance had
almost come into Betty's life. It knew
that she had kept steady company with
a lad about her own age some twelve
years before: knew that one afternoon
they went buggy driving and that the
next day young Klmberly; shook the duit
of Arcady's main street from hisaht^-s,
but it attached no significance to the fact.
The winter .went. Spring camp. The
earth sweetened with odors; it thrilled
and quivered with expectancy." When Xhf
fresh little folded leaves burst their buds
Betty brought her machine out on her
tiny porch. She sung as she sewed.
Betty went to church on Sunday fr-l
ing in harmony with the day in syite of
the last pin jabbed into her.
"Not married yet?" asked a young man
She was never going to mind again, one
couldn't mind after one's youth was d.ad.
She was going to be a cheerful and phil
anthropic pincushion for the rest of her
days. Jeering at spinsters had been in
fashion In Arcady long before her birth
and bade fair to remain popular for seme
time after her death.
When she had slipped back into the
safeness and warmth of her tiny bedroom
ehe stood long before the* dingy, cracked
mirror that never encouraged vanity, and
whispered :
"You're CS and you've been to the
funeral of your own youth. It would be
mighty funny to folks if they knewâ
mighty funnyâ but they don'tâ they
don't."
who had been away from Arcady. In a
voice that thundered through the church.
"Well, well, I'll swanâ an' a good lookln*
woman, too!"
"She's still hopln'." It was a woman
who spoke, and she fixed the pink rib
bon about Betty's throat with a SU3
plcious eye. the poor little luxury of a
pink ribbon that Betty had sewed half
the night to possess.
Betty flung up her head angrily and
looked into a pair of eyes that had soma
years before been the very light of her
ownâ the eyes of Henry Klmberly.
The color left her face, her hands
clasped themselves nervously. Tears of
distress feathered, but she. drove them
back desptrately.
"Howdy do. Miss Betty." said Kim
berly, making his way through the crowd
and holding out his hand.
"Howdy do. Mr. Kimberly," Betty
flung back, disdaining the hand.
She marched. past him down the aisld
and turned toward home, looking neither
to the right nor left. Th#re*wa9 a mur

strode after, her. - â¢
."Haw dared you to speak to me?" said
Betty, fiercely..
Kimberly had overtaken her in thÂ«
quiet lane that led to her home. "Now,
Betty," his voice was firm. "I'm not goln*
to pui up with any of your tantrums.
You've got to listen to me. and you'va
got to tell me what you meant by filngin*
them crab-apple blossoma in my face
twelve years ago. I've come a good ways
to rind out. I .was askln' about you; you
know Jim. Dale's come out our way. I
was hopin' you were happily married, but
you ain't. You might have married a
better an' a wiser an' a richer man, but
you haven't. I've come a long way to
find out why you flung them blooms at
me. They were so pretty, Betty, like
your pink cheeks, an* as we drove under
the treesâ ivird, I couldn't talk! The
words choked me an' I couldn't get 'em
out. Do you think It was a nice thing
for you to do?"
"Do you think it was nice to give them
to me?" Betty's voice shook. Klmberly
looked at her in amazement. % -
"Didn't you. mean It?" she asked.
"I meant every, word of it, Betty; I
mean it now." -â¢ .
Betty stiffened. *
"I wanted the Rowers to tell you. Bet

"They did." Betty laughed shrilly. "Oh,

"What?" sternly. U. V", "

"What?" more sternly.
"Don't you know," sobbed Betty, "that

wouldn'tâ have you If I could'?"
Doubt went out of Betty's soul at sight
of Klmberly's face and a red rush of Joy
leaped to her brows.
Klmberly opened his arms. Betty was
never to be a pincushion again. A little
brown bird, sore pressed by the chasing
hawk, she swept Into shelter, with a glad
cry.

CHAPTER XXXI.
â¢CONSOLIDATED Copper at 110. The
/ / day after his talk with Uncle Peter
I /Â» Percival through three different
\ly brokers gave orders to buy ten
\^ thousand shares.
*i tried to give Relpin an order for five
thousand shares over the telephone," ho
ea!d to Uncle Peter, "but they're used to
those fifty and a hundred thousand
dollar pikers down in that neighborhood.
He teemed to think I was joshing him.
When I told him I meant it and was
ready to take practically all he could buy
for the next few weeks or eo I think he
fell over in the booth and had to be
helped out."
Orders for twenty thousand more shares
in thousand share lots during the next
three weeks sent the stocK to 115. Yet
wise men in the street seemed to fear the
etock. They were waiting cautiously for
more definite leadings. The plunging of
Bines made rather a sensation, and when
it became known that his holdings were
large and growing almost daily larger,
the waning confidence of a speculator
here and there would be revived.
At 115 the stock rested again, with few
rales recorded. A certain few of the elect
regarded this calm as ominous!. It was
half believed by others that the manipu
lations of the Inner ring would presently
advance the stock to a sensational figure,
and that the reckless young man from
Montana might be acting upon informa
tion of a definite character. But among
the veteran speculators the feeling was
conservative. Before buying they pre
ferred to await some sign that the ad
vance had actually begun. The conserva
tives were mostly the bald old fellows.
Among the Illusions that rarely survive a
man's hair In Wall street is the one that
"sure things" are necessarily sure.
Percival watched Consolidated Copper
ro back to 110, and bought acralnâ ten
thousand shares. The price went up two
points the day after his orders were
placed, and two days later dropped back
to 110. The conservatives began to agree
with the younger set of speculators, in
fo far as both now believed that the
etock was behaving In an unnatural man
ner. Indicating that "something was do
ing"âthat manipulation behind the
ecenes was under way to a definite end.
The conservatives and the radicals dif
fered as to Hrhat this end was. But then
Wall street Is nourished almost exclu
sively upon differences of opinion.
Percival now had accounts with five
firms of brokers.
"Relpin." he explained to Uncle
Peter, "Is a foxy boy. He's foxier
than a fox. He not only
tried to hedge on what he told meâ said
he'd been drinking absinthe frappe that
day. and It always gets him dreamyâ but
he actually had the nerve to give me the
opposite eteer. Of course he knows the
d*al clear to the center, and Shepler
knows that he knows, and he must have
been afraid Shepler would suspect he'd
been talking-. So I only traded a few
thousand shares with him. I didn't want
to embarrass him. Funny about him. too.
I never heard before of his drinking any
thing to speak of. And there isn't a
man In the street comes so near to know
ing what the big boys are up to. But
we're on the winning cards all right. I
get exactly the same Information from
a dozen confidential sources; some of it
I can trace to Relpin. and some of it
right to Shenler himself."
"Course I'm le'avin' it all to you," an
pwered Uncle Peter; "and I must say I
do admire the way you take hold and
pet things on the move. You don't let
any grass grow under your heels. You
got a cood head fur them things. I can
tell by the way you start outâ just like
your ca fur all the world. I'll feel safe
enough about my money as long as you
keep your health. If only you got the
nerve. I've known men would play a big
proposition half throweh and then get
scared and pull out. Your pa wa'n't that
way. He could get a proposition right
by its handle everv time, and they never
come any too big fur him; the bigger
they was better he liked "em. That's the
kind of genius I think you got. You ain't
afraid to take a chance."
Perclval beamed modestly under praise
of this sort which now came to him
daily.
"It's good discipline for me, too. Uncle
Ptter. It'e what I needed, something to
put my mind on. I needed a n^f Inter
es-t In life. You had me down Tight. I
wasn't doing myself a bit of good with
nothing to occupy my mind."
"Well # I'm mighty glad you thought up
this stock deal. It'll give you good busi
ness habits and experience, say nothing
of doubling your capital."
"And I've gone in with Burman on his
corn deal. He's begun to buy. and he
has it cinched this time. i.e'U be the
corn king all right by June 1: don't make
any mistake on that. I thought as long
as we were plunging so heavy in West
ern Trolley and Union Cordage, along
with the copper_ we might as well take
the side line of' corn. Then we won't
have our eggs all in one basket."
J'AU right, son. all right! I'm trustln*
you. A corner in corn is better'n a cor
ner in wild oats any day: anythlncr to
keep you straight and doln' something. I
don't care how many millions you pile
up! I hear the Federal Oil people's back
of the couper deal."
"That's right: the oil crowd and Shep
ler. I had it straight from Relpin that
night. They're negotiating now with the
Rothschilds to limit the output of the
Rio Tinto mines. They'll end by controll
ing them, and thenâ well, we'll have a
roll of the ye'low boysâ say, we'll have
to lay Quiet for a year Just to count it"
"Do . It good while you're doln' It"
urged Uncle Peter, cheerfully. "I rely
t-o much on your Judgment. I want you
to get action on my stuff, too. I got a
couple millions that ought to be workln'
harder than they are."
"Good: I didn't think you had so much
gambler In you."
. "It's, fur a. worthy purpose, eon. And
it seems too* bad that Pishy can't pull
out something with her bit, when it's to
be had uo easy. From what that span
gle-faced beau of hers tells me there's
got to be some expensive plumbing done
in that castle be gets sawed off on to
him."- .
"We'll let. sis In, too," exclaimed her
brother, generously, "and ma could use
a little more In her business. She's sit
ting up nights to corner all the Amal
gamated Hard-luck on the Island. We'll
pool Issue, and say we'll make those Fed
eral Oil pikers think we've gnawed a cor
ner off the BUbtreasury. I'll put an order
in for twenty thousand more shares to
morrowâ among, the three etocks. And
then we'll have to see about getting all
our cxDltal here. We'll need every cent
of It that's loose: and maybe we better
sell off some of those dead-wood stocks."
The twenty thousand shares were
bought by. the following week, five thou- .
sand of them being Consolidated Copper,
ten thousand Western Trolley, and five
thousand Union Cordage. Consolidated
Copper fell off two points, upon rumors,
traceable to no source, that the company
had on hand a large secret supply of
copper, and was producing largely in ex
cess of the demand every month.
Perclval told Uncle Peter of these ru
mors, and chuckled with the easy con
fidence of a man who knows secrets.
"Tou see. It's coming the way Relpln
said. The Insiders are hammering down
the stock with those reports,- hammer
ing with one hand, and buying up small
lots quietly with the other. But you'll
notice the price of copper doesn't go down
any. They keep it at seventeen cents all
right. Now. the moment they get control
of the European supply they'll hold the
stuff, force up the selling price to awful
figures and squeeze out dividends that
will make you wear blue glasses to look
at them."
"You certainly do know your business,
son," said Uncle Peter fervently. "You
certainly got your pa's head on you. You
remind me more and more of Dan'l J.
Bines every day. I'd rather trust your
Judgment now than lots of older men
down there. You know their tricks all
right. Get In good and hard so long as
you got a sure thing. I'd hate to have
you come meachin' around after that
stock has kited, and be klckln* because
you hadn't bet what your hand was
worth."
"Trust me for that, Uncle Peter. Gar
tner tried to steer raÂ« off this line of
Etocks the other night. He'd heard these
rumors about a slump and he's 50 years
old at that. I thanked him for his tip and
coppered it with another thousand shares
all around next day. The way Garmer
can tell when you're playing a busted
flush makes you nervous, but I haven't
looked over his li
cense to know every
thing down in the
Street yet."
The moral gain to
Perclval from his
new devotion to the
stock market was
commented upon ap
provingly both by
Uncle Peter and by ,
his mother. It waa
quite as tangible as his money profits
promised to be. He ceased to frequent
the temple of chance in Forty-fourth
street, to the proprietor's genuine regret.
The poker games at the hotel he aban
doned as being trivial. And the cabmen
along upper Broadway had seldom now
the opportunity to compete for his early
morning patronage. He began to keep
early hours and to do less casual drink
ing- during the day. After three weeks of
this comparatively regular living his
mother rejoiced to note* signs that his
breakfast appetite waa returning.
"You see," he explained earnestly to
Uncle Peter, "a man to make anything at
this game must keep his head clear, and
he must have good health to do that. I
meet a lot of those fellows down there
that queer themselves by drink. It
doesn't do much hurt when a man isn't
needing his brains,â but no more of It for
me Just now!"
"That's right, 6on. I knew. J could make
something more than a polite sosh out of
you. I knew you'd pull up if you got into
business like you been doln'."
"Come down town with me this after
noon and see me m^ke a play. Uncle Pe
ter. I think I'll bfcgin now to buy on a
margin. The rise can't hold off much
longer."
"I'd like to, son, but I'd laid out to take
a walk up to the park this afternoon and
look at the monkeys awhile. I need the
outdoors, and anyway you don't need me
down there. You know your part all
right. My! but I'd begin to feel nervous
with all that money up, if It was anybody
but you, now."
In pursuance of his pronounced plan
Uncle Peter walked up Fifth avenue that
afternoon. But he stopped short of the
park. At the imposing entrance of the
Arlington he turned In. At the desk he
asked for Mrs. Wybert.
"I'll see If Mrs. Wybert Is in," said the
cterk, handing him a blank card; "your
name, please?"
The old man wrote, "Mr. Peter Bines of
Montana City would like a few minutes'
talk with Mrs. Wybert."
The boy was gone so long that I'nole
Peter, waiting, began to suspect he would
not be received. He returned ai length
with the message, "The lady suys will
you please step upstairs,"
Going up in the elevator, the old man
was ushered by a maid Into a violet
scented little nest whose pale green wails
were touched discreetly with hangings
of heliotrope. An artist, in Uncle Peter's
place, might have fancied that the color
scheme of the apartment cried out for a
bit of warmth. A glowing, warm-haired
woman was needed to set the walls afire;
and the need was met when Mrs. Wybert
entered. . '
She wore a Ionjj coat of seal trimmed
with chinchilla, and had been, apparently,
about to go out. Uncle Peter rose and
bowed. Mrs. Wybert nodded rather un
certainly.
"You wished to see me, Mr. Bines?"
"I did want to have a little talk with
you, Mrs. Wybert, but you're goln' out,
and I won't keep you. I know how
prtsstd you New York society ladles are
with your engagements."
Mrs. Wybert had seemed to be puzzled.
She .was still puzzled, but unmistakably
pleased. The old man was looking at her
with frank and friendly apology for his
Intrusion. Plainly she had nothing to
fear from him. She became gracious.
"It was only a little shopping tour, Mr.
Bines, that and a call at the hospital,
where they have one of my maids who
slipped on the avenue yesterday and
fractured one of herâ erâ limbs. Do sii
down."
Mrs. Wybert said "limb" for leg with'
the rather conscious air of escaping from
an awkward situation duly by the sub
tlest finesse.
She seated herself before a green and
heliotrope background that instantly tool
warmth from her color. Uncle Peter still
hesitated.
"You see, I wanted kind of a long chat
with you, Mrs.' Wybert-ra friendly chat
If you didn't mind, and 'I'd feel a mite
nervous if you're bundled ud that way."
"I shall be delighted. Mr. Bines, to have
a. long, friendly chat. I'll send my cloak
back, and you take your own time. There
now. do be right comfortable!"
The old man settled himself and be
etowed upon his hostess a. long look of
approval.
â¢The reports never done you Justice,
Mrs. Wybert. and they was very glowin'
reports, too."
"You're very kind; Mr. Bines, awfully
good of you!" . Â¦
"I'm goin' to be more, Mrs. Wybert. I'm
goln' to be a little bit confidentialâ right
out in the straight open with you."
'.'I am sure of that."
"And if you want to. you can bÂ» tfie
same with me. I ain't ever held anything
against you, and maybe now I can do you
a favor." . Â¦ â¢
"It's right good of you to say so."
"Now, look here, ma'am, lets you and
me get right down to cases about this
society game here in ; New .York."
Mrs. Wybert laughed charmingly and
relaxed in manner.
"I'm with you, Mr. Bines. What about
It, now?" â¢ .
"Now don't get suspicious, and tell me
to mind my own business when I ask you'
questions."
"I couldn't be suspicious of youâ really
I feel as if I'd have to tell you everything
you asked me, some way."
"Well, there's been some talk of your
marrying that young Milbrey. Now tell
me the inside of it."
She looked at the old man closely. Her
intuition confirmed his own protestations
of friendliness.
"I don't mind telling you in strict con
fidence there was talk of marriage, and
his people, all but the sister, encouraged
it. Then after she was engaged to Shep
ler they talked him out of it. Now that's
the whole God's truth, if it does you any
good." - .
"If you had married him you'd 'a' had
a position, like they say - hefe, right
away."
"ph. dear, yes! Awfully swagger peo
pleâdead swell, every one of them.
There's no doubt about that."
"Exactly; and there ain't really any
reason why you can't be somebody here."
"Well, between you and I. Mr. Bines, I
can play the part as well as a whole lot
of these women here. I don't want to
talk, of course, butâ well!"
"Exactly, you can give half of 'em
cards and spades and both casinos, Mrs.
Wybert."
"And I'll do it yet. I'm not through by
any means. They're not the on'.y per
ftctly elegant people in this town!"
"Of course you'll
doit; and you could"
do it-'" better if yjou
had three or four
times the stake you
got."
"Dollars are worth more apiece in New
York than any town I've ever been in."
"Mrs. . Wybert, I can put you right
square into a good thing, and I'm .going
to do it. Heard anything about Consoli
dated Copper?"
"I've heard something big was doing in
it; but nobo<ly seems to know for
tain. My broker is afraid of it." t
"Very well. Now you do as I tell you.
and you can clean up a blgf lot inside of
the next two months. If you do as I tell
you, mind, no matter what you hear, and
if you don't talk." s
Mrs. Wybert meditated.
"Mr. Bines, I'mâ It's natural that I'm
a little uneasy. Why should you want to
see me do well after our little affair?
Now, out with it! What are you trying
to do. with mo? What do you expect me
to do for you? Get down to cases your
self, Mr. Bines:"
Â¦ "I will, ma'am, in a few words. My
granddaughter, you may have heard. Is
engaged to an Kngllshman. He's next
thing to broke, but he's got a title com-
Inpr. Naturally, he's looking fur money.
Naturally, he don't care , fur the girl.
P,ut I'm afraid she's infatuated with him.
Now, then, if he had a chance at some
one with more money than she's got,
Â¦why, naturally, he'd Jump at it."
"Aren't you a little bit wild?"
"Not a little bit. He saw you at New
port laÂ«t summer, and he's seen you
here. He was tearing the adjectives up
telling me about you the other night,
not knowing, you understand, that- I'd
ever heard tell of you before. You could
marry him in a jiffy if you follow my di
rections." Â»
"But your granddaughter has a for
tune."
"Yojj'H have as much if you play this
the way I tell you. Andâ you never can
tell In these timesâ she might lose a good
bit of hers." /
"It's very peculiar, Mr. Binesâ your
proposition."
"Look at what a brilliant match It
would be fur you. Why, you'd be Lady
Capsrlthorpe. with dukes and counts tak
in" off their crowns to you. And that
other one â that Mllbreyâ from all I hear
he's llghter'n' corkâ cut his gralusses and
he'd float right up into the sky. He ain't
pot anything but his good family and a
thirst."
"I see. This Mauburn Isn't good enough
for your family, but you reckon he's good
enough for me? Is that it, now?"
"Come. Mrs. Wybert, let's be broad.
That's the game you like and I don't
criticize you fur It. It's a good game If
that's the kind of a game you're hunlin'
fur. And you can play -It better'n my
granddaughter. . She wa'n't fur Itâ and
I'd rather have her marry an American,
anyhow. Now you like it, and you got
"beautyâ only you need more money. I'll
put you in the way of it and you can cut
out my granddaughter."
"I must think about Â» it. Suppose I
plunge in copper; and your tip isn't
straight. I've seen hard times, Mr. Bines,
in my life. I haven't always wore seal
skin and diamonds." *
"Mrs. Wybert. you was in Montana long
enough to know, how I stand there?"
"I know you're Al, and your. word's as
good as another man's money; I don't
question your good intentions." . â¢
, "It's my Judgment, hey? Now, look
here, I won't tell you what I know and
how I know it. but you can take my word
that I know I do know. You plunge, in
copper right off, without saying a. word
to Â¦ anybody or makln" any splurge, and
hereâ" Â¦ ' Â¦>
From the little table at his elbow he
picked up the card that had announced
him and drew out his pencil. . Â¦ - -
"You said my word was as good as an
other man's money. Now I'm going 'to
write on this card just what. you have to
do and you're to follow directions, no mat
ter what you â¢ hear about other people
doing. There'll be all sorts of reports
about that stock, but you follow my di
rectidns.' ' ' Â¦
He wrote on the back of the cardÂ»with
his pencil. ' ;
"Consolidated Copper, rememberâ and
now I'm a-goin' to write something else
under them directions.- -Â¦ *i' i
disposed of to- an English syndicate, the
proceeds being retained, for the. stock
deal. All but the best paying of the rail
road, smelting and land-improvement se
curities were also thrown on the market.
The experience was a valuable one to
the young man, enlarging greatly his
knowledge of affairs and giving him x a
needed insight into the methods by which
the fortune had been accumulated.
"That . was u. slow, clumsy, old-fash
ioned way to make money," he declared
to Coplen. "Nowadays it's done quicker."
His grasp of details delighted Uncle
Peter and surprised Coplen.
"I didn't know but he might be getting
plucked." said Coplen to the old man,
"with all that money being drawn out
so fast. If I hadn't known you were
with him I'd have taken it on myself to
find out something about his operations.
But he's all right, apparently. He had a
scent like a hound " for those dead-wood
propertiesâ got rid of them while we
were making up our minds to. That boy
will make his way unless I'm mistaken.
He has a head^for detail."
"I'll make him a bigger man than his
pa was yet," declared Uncle Peter. "But
I wouldn't want to let on that I'd had
anything to do with it. He'll think he's
done it all himself, and It's right he
should. It stimulates "em. Boys of his
age need Just about so much conceit, and
it dori't do to take it out of 'em."
Reports of the most encouraging char
acter came from Burman. The deal in
corn was being engineered with a riper
caution than had been displayed in the
ill-fated wheat deal of the spring before.
"Ilurman's drawn close up to a million
already," said 4 Percival to Uncle Beter.
"and now he wants me to stand ready for
another million."
"Is Burman," asked , Uncle Peter, "that
young fellow that had a habit of standing
pat on a pair of jacks, and then betttn'
everybody off the board?"
"Yes, that was Burman." , .
"Well, I liked his ways. , I , should say
he could do you a whole lot of good in a
corn deal."
In the flush of his great. plans and great
expectations came a chance meeting with
Miss Milbrey. He had seen her only at a
distance since their talk at Newport.
Yet the thought of her had persisted as
a plaintive undertone through all the
days after. Only the sharp, hurt. to his.
sensitive prideâ from the conviction that
she had found him tolerable solely be
cause of his moneyâ had saved him from
ihe willing admission to himself- that he
had carried Oft too much of her ever to.
forget. In. his quiet moments, the tones
of her clear, low voice came movingly to
his ears, and his eyes conjured Involun
tarily her girlish animation, her. rounded
young form, her color and fireâ the
choked, smoldering fire of â¢ opals. '--He
saw the curve of her wrist, the confident
swing of her. walk, the easy, poise of her
head,, her bearing, at once . girlish and
womanly, the little air, half of wistful
appeal, and half of self-reliant assertion.
Yet he failed not to regard these indul
gences as utter folly. . It had been folly
enough while he believed that she stood
ready to accept . him and his - wealth. .It
was more flagrant, now that her quest
foHa husband with millions had been so
handsomely rewarded. ;, ;.-â¢'Â¦
But again, the fact that she was now
clearly Impossible for him, so that even a
degrading submission Â¦ on his part could
no longer secure her,. served only to bring
her attractiveness into greater, reliefs
With her fear gone that a sudden Impulse
to possess her might lead him to stultify
himself, he could see more clearly than
ever why she was , and promised .always
to.be to him the very dearest womanJn
the worldâ dearest -in spite of all he could
reason about so lucidly. He j felt,- then, ' a
little shock of unreasoning Joy to find one
night that they were .dining: together; at
the Oldakers'. - Â¦-* Â¦.. . Â¦"â¢; â¢ :Â¦ Â¦â¢-.: Â¦ ?
At 4" o'clock, he had , received a hasty
note signed "Fidelia Oldaker," penned in
the fine,. precise script of some yoang la
dles' finishing schoolâ perhaps. extinct now.
for fifty yearsâ imploring him,* if aught of
chivalry survived ; wlthin . his breast,'- to
fetch his young- : grandfather and - dino
with her that evening. Two men had In
considerately succumbed.- at 1 this eleventh
and she glanced at Uncle Peter with arch
liberality In her bright eyes.
That gentleman bowed lowâ a bow that
had been the- admiration of the smartest
society in / Marietta County, Ohio, fifty
years and more ago.
"I'm paid fur coming by coming," he
replied, urbanely^ .
"There, now!". cried his hostess, "that's
, pretty, and means something. You shall
take' me in for. that." .
"I'll have to give you a credit slip,
ma'am. You've overpaid me." And Mrs.
Oldaker, with a coy fillip of her fan, call
ed him a naughty boy.
"Here, Rulon," she called to Shepler,
"are two young daredevils' ' who've been
good enough to save me as many empty '
chairs. Now you shall take out Cornelia,
and this Juvenile eprlg shall relieve you
of Avice Mllbrey. It's a providence. You
engaged couples are always so dull when
you're banished from your own del a
deux." , Â¦ . Â¦_
Shepler bowed and greeted the two men.
Perclval sought Miss Milbrey, who was
with her aunt. at the other side of the
old-fashioned room,' a room whose bro
cade hangings had been Imported from
England in the days of the Georges, and
whose furniture was ~ fabricated in the
time' when France was suffering its last
kings.
Throughout the dinner their entire ab
sorption In each other was all but un
broken. Percival never could remember
who had sat at his left, and Miss Mll
brey 's right-hand neighbor, saw more
than the winning line of her profile but
twice. Perclval began: v
"Do you know, I've never been able to
classify you at all. I never could tell how
to take you." / ,
"I'll tell you a secret,. Mr. Bines: I
think I'm not to be taken at all. I've
begun to suspect that I'm like one of
those works that haven't any rhyme â like
'orange' and 'month,' you know "
"But you find poetry in life? I do."
"Plenty of verseâ not much poetry."
"How would you order life now If the
little old wish Ing-lady came to your door
and knocked?"
And they plunged forthwith, buoyed by
youth's divine effrontery, into mysteries
that have vexed diners, not less than
hermit sages, since "the fog of old
time" first obscured truth. Of life and
deathâ the ugliness of life, and the beauty
of deathâ ...
"â¢ â¢ â¢ even as death might smile.
Petting- the plumes of some surprised soul,"
quoted the girl. Of loving and hating,
they talked:. of trying and fallingâ of the .
implacable urge under which men must
strive In. the face of certain defeat â of the
probability that men are purposely born
fools, since. If they were born wise they
would refuse to strive; whereupon life
and death would merge, and naught
would prevail but j a vast Indiffer
ence. "In fact, they were very deep and
affected to consider these grave matters
seriously. They affected that they never Â¦
habitually thought of lesser concerns.
And they had an air of listening to each
other as If they wereywelghlng the words
Judicially, and were quite above any mere
sensuous considerations of personality.- â¢ :
.And they , fell together once In de- :
ciding whether, after all, the brightest*

the lady threw herself confidently on the
well-known generosity of the Bines male

acrobatic people fall Into from their high

Uncle Peter was more than willing:. lie
like the Oldakers. %
"They're the only sane folks I've met
among your . friends." he . had told his
grandson. He had dined there frequently
during the winter, and professed to be
enamored of the hostess. That fragile
but sprightly bit of antiquity professed In
turn to find Uncle Peter a very dangerous
man among the ladies. They flirted out*
rageously at every opportunity, and Un
cle Peter sent her more violets than many
a popular debutante received that win
ter.
Perclval, with his new air of Wall street
operator, was inclined to hesitate.
"You know I'm up early now, Uncle
Peter, to get the day's run of the mar
kets before I go downtown, and a -man
can't do much in the way of dinners
when his mind is working all day. Per
haps Mauburn will go."
But Mauburn was taking Psyche and
Mrs. Drelmer to the first night of a play,
and Percival was finally persuaded by the
old man to relax, for one evening, the
austerity of his regime.
"But how your pa would love to see you
so conscientious," he said, "and you with
Wall street, or a good part of it, right
under you heel. Just like that," and the
old man ground his heel viciously into the
carpet.' m
When Percival found Shepler with Mrs.
Van Gelst and Miss Mllbrey among the
Oldakers' guests he rejoiced. Now he
would talk to her without any of that
old awkward self-consciousness. He was
even audacious enough to insist that Mrs.
Oldaker direct him to take Miss Mllbrey
out to dinner.
"I claim it as the price of coming, you
know, when T waÂ« only an afterthought."
"You shall be paid,
sir," his hostess de
clared, "if you consid

"But. really, she's not* so old."
"No, not so very old. Still, she's going

said Shepler. "I had occasion not

was characteristic He said. 'We make

what they may do. Ton sea they were

they went West, and as necessity.stimu

"So do I," said his betrothed.

THE AMATEUR NAPOLEOJJ OB* WAXIÂ»
STREET.
At the beginning of April the situation
in the three stocks Perclval had bought
so heavily . grew undeniably tense. Con
solidated Copper went from 109 to 103 ia
a week. But Percival's enthusiasm suf
fered little abatement ' from the drop.
"You see," he reminded Uncle Peter. **tt
isn't exactly what I expected, but lfs
right in line with it, so It doesn't alarm
me. I knew those fellows lnslfis were
bound to hammer It down If they could. .
It wouldn't phase me a bit If It sagged
to 93."
"My! My!" exclaimed Uncle Peter, with
warm approval, "the way you master
this business certainly does win me. X
tell you, it's a mighty good thing wa got
your brains to depend on. I'm all right
the other side of Council Bluffs, but I'm
a tenderfoot here, sure, where every
body's tryin* to set the best of you. You
see, out there, everybody tries to make
the best of it. But here they try to get
the best of it. I told that to one of them

proud of you, son. Dan'l - J. liked bis
propositions himselfâ but. well. I'd Just
like to have him see the nerve you've
showed, that's all."
.Uncle Peter's professions of confidence
were unfailing, and Perclval took new
hope and faith In his Judgment from them
daily.
Nevertheless, as the weeks passed, and
the mysterious insiders succeeded In their
design of keeping the stock from rising,
. he came to feel a touch of anxiety. More.
Indeed, than he was able to communicate
to Uncle Peter, without confessing out
right that he had lost faith In himself.
That he was unable to -do,' even If it
were true, which he doubted. The Bines
fortune was now hanging, as to all but
some of the Western properties, on . the
turning of the" three stocks. Yet the old
man's confidence In the young- man's
acumen was Invulnerable. No shaft that
Perclval was able to fashion had point
enough to pierce It And he was loth to
batter it down, for he still had the gam
bler's faith In his luck.
"You got your father's head In business
matters," ; was Uncle " Peter's invariable

THE NEWS BROKEN. WHEREUPON
AN ENGAGEMENT IS BROKEN.
At 7 Percival found Uncle Peter at
his hotel, still in abyssmal depths of woe.
Together they went to break the awful
news to the unsuspecting Mrs. Bines and
Psyche.
"If you'd only learned something useful
while you had the chance." began Uncle
Peter, dismally, as they were driven to
the Hightower, "how to do tricks with
cards, or how to sing funny songs, like

back yard, and now he's married to one
of the richest ladies in New York. Why
couldn't you 'a* been lcarnln* some of

tones were bitter to excessâ "you was a
rich man's son and raised In idlenessâ
and now, when the rainy day's come, you
can't even take a white rabbit out of a
Â¦tove-plpe hat!"
To these senile maunderlngs Percival
paid no attention. When they came into
the crowd and lights of the Hightower,
he sent the old man up alone.
"You go. please, and break It to them.
Uncle Peter. I'd rather not be there Just
at first. I'll come along In a little bit."
So Uncle Peter went, protesting that he
was a broken old man and a cumberer of
God's green earth.
Mrs. Bines and Psyche had that mo
ment sat down to dinner. Uncle Peter's
manner at once alarmed them.
"It's all over," he said, sinking into a
chair.
"Why, what's the matter. Uncle Pe
ter?"
"Percival has â " . .
Mrs. Bines arose quicky. trembling.
"Thereâ I Just knew it â it's all over

"He ain't been run overâ he's gone

"He's ruined us, I tell you, Mannyâ

"Hasn't he been hurt at all?â not even

"That boy never had any sense. I tell
you he's lost all our money."
"And he ain't a bit hurt â nothing the

"Ain't any more hurt than you or me

"You're not fooling his mother. Uncle
Peter r*
"I tell you he's alive and well, only he's

Mrs; Bines breathed a Ions, trembling
sigh of relief, and sat down to the table
again.
"Well, nÂ» need to scar* a body out of
their wits â scaring his mother to death

it's gone it's gone.**
"But ma. It Is awful!" cried Psyche.
"Listen to what Uncle Peter says. We're

His mother ran to him. satisfied herself
that he was sound In wind and limb* that
he had not treacherously donned his sum

wet. Then she led him to the table.
"Now you sit right down here and take
some food. If you're all right, every
thing is all right." .
With a weak attempt at his old gayety
he began:
"Really. Mrs. Crackenthorpeâ *' but b*

"I'm sorry, sis, clear into my bones. I

"Weil, you Just let him alone; you'll

"If I hadn't gone in so heary," groaned
Percival. "Or if I'd only got tied up in
some way for a few weeks-somethlns; I
could tide over."
"Yes." said Uncle Peter, with a cheerful
effort at sarcasm. "It's always *asy to

"Youâ youâ you'd make a purty man
ager of anything, wouldn't you! As if
you could be trusted with anything again
that needs a schoolboy's intelligence.
Even If you had the brains, you ain't

you got to work it with brains. No.
sir, that country ain't what it
used to be. There might 'a* been a time
when you'd made tyour board and clothes

it's full of men that hustle and keep their

had to make the game pay now. But
youâ don't let me hear any more of that
nonsense!"
Percival had entered the room pale. He
was now red. The old man's bitter con
tempt had flushed him Into momentary
forgetfulness of the disaster.
"Look here. Uncle Peter, you've been
telling me right along I did have my
father's head and my father's ways and
his nerve, and God knows what I didn't
have that he had!"
"I was fooledâ I can't deny it What's
the use of tryln* to crawl out of It? You
did fool me, and I own up to It; I thought
you had some sense, some capacity; but
you was only like him on the surface;

"I don't believe it is. Uncle Peterâ I
won't touch another share, and I won't
go near 8hepler again. We'll keep the
One Girl."
He called a cab for the old man, and
saw him started safely off uptown.
At the hotel Uncle Peter met Billy
Brue flourishing an evening paper that
flared with exclamatory headlines.
"It's all in the papers. Uncle Peter!"
"Dead broke! Ain't it awful, Billy!"
Peter. It's so horrible!" " Â¦-; Â¦Â¦Â¦.Â¦'

"Well, it ain't muchâ of course I

lieve Wall street Is your game. Course,
I don't say you ain't got a gameâ of some
kindâ but I got one of them presentiments
that It ain't Wall atreet"
Uncle Peter finished his glass of beer.
"Lord! don't ask me," he replied, with
the unconcern of perfect trust "Of
course. If you've lost your nerve, or if
you think all these things you been tell
in* mÂ«Vw Jest some one foolin" you "
"No. I know better than that and I
haven't lost my nerve. After all, it only
means that- the crowd Is looking for a
bigger rake-off."
"You pa always kept his nerve," said
Uncle Peter. "I've known him to make
big money by keepin' It when other men
lost theirs. Of course, he had genius fur
it and you're purty young yet "
"I only thought of it for a minute. I
didn't really mean it"
They read the next afternoon that Gor
don Blythe had. been found dead of
asphyxiation In a little downtown hotel
under circumstances that left no doubt of
"Uncle Peter, she's down to S3, and I've
had to margin up a good bit I didn't
think It could get below So at the worst"
"Oh, I can't bother about them things.
Just think of when she booms."
"I doâ but sayâ do you think we bet
ter pinch our bet*?"
"Now. George," he was saying, "give us
a real lively pint of wine. You see, your
self, that cork isn't fresh; show It to
Frank there, and look at the wine itself â
come now, George, hardly a bubble in It!
Tell Frank I'll leave It to him, by Gad!
If this bottle is right."
The waiter left with the rejected wine
and they heard Blythe resume to his com
panion, with the relish of a connoisseur:
"It's a simple matter of genius, old
chapâ you understand?â to tell good wine
âthat Is really to discriminate finely. If
a chap's not born with the gift he's an ass
to think he can acquire it. Sometime
you've a setter pup that looks ntâ head
good. no*e all rightâ all the markingsâ
but you try him out and you know in half
an hour he'll never do in the world. Then
it's better to take him out back of the
barn and shoot him, by Gad. rather
than have his strain corrupt the rest of
the kennel. He can't acquire the gift,
and no more can a chap acquire this
gift Ah! I was right was I, George?
Look how different that cork is."
He sipped the bubbling amber wine with
cautious and exacting appreciation. As
the waiter would have refilled the glasses,
Blythe stopped him.
"Now, George, let me tell you some
thing. You're serving at this moment the
only gentleman's drink. Do It right
George. Listen! Never refill a gentle
man's glass until it's quite empty. Do
you know why? Think, George! You
pour fresh wine Into stale wine and what
have you?â neither. I've taught you
something, George. Never fill a glass till
it's empty."
"It beats me," said Uncle Peter, when
Blythe and his companion had gone, "how
easy them rich codgers get along. That
fellow must 'a' made a study of wines,
and nothing worse ever bothers him than
a waiter fillln' his glass wrong."

Percival was staring at Blythe in un

Uncle Peter still chatting with him, and

came out ten minutes later Uncle Peter
was waiting for him alone.
"Your friend Mr. Blythe is a clever sort

In the cafe of the Bavarian, to which

Copper had obviously not gone wrong.

Blythe was the model of easy, indolent,

coat with a carnation in the lapel, the
precise crease of his trousers, the pplck

ful confidence of manner, proclaimed his
mind to be free from all but the pleasant

airily.

"Ruined!" he cried, hoarsely, as If the

upon him. "My God! Ruined, and at my

of repose which comes to big men who
have stayed much in big out-of-door soli

Percival watched the decline with a
conviction that he was dreaming. He
laughed to think of his relief when he
should awaken. The crowd surged about
the ticker and their voices cam a a* from

Then he had seen his cunningly built
foundations, rested upon with hopes so
high for three months, melt away like
snow when the blistering Chinook comes.
For two days he clung to the ticker
tape as to a life line. He had committed
the millions of the family as lightly as
ever he had staked a hundred, dollars on
the turn of a card or left ten on the
change tray for his waiter.
Into this maelstrom of a panic market
the Bines fortune had been sucked with
a swiftness bo terrible that the family's
chief advising member was left dazed and
incredulous.
Incidentally, Western Trolley had gone

concern. As to the copper situation, the
comment was pat It had been suddenly
disclosed, not only that no combination
could be made to include the European
mines, but that the Consolidated Com
pany had an unsold surplus of 150,000,000
pounds of copper; that it was producing
20,000,000 pounds a month more than could
be sold, and that it had made large secret
sales abroad at from two to three cents
below the 'market price.
As if fearing that these adverse condi
tions did not sufficiently Insure the stock's
downfall, the Shepler group of Federal
Oil operators beat it down further with
what was veritably a golden sledge. That
is, they exported gold at a loss. At a
time when obligations could have been
met more cheaply with bought bills they
sent out many golden cargoes at , an
actual loss of $300 on the half million.'. As

the southeast is a mass of dull black
clouds. Their face is unbroken. But the

not yet felt below. Two hours later its
warmth comes. In ten minutes the mer

strength and warmth, blowing with a
mighty roar.
Twelve hours afterward the snow, three

In this manner suddenly went the Bines

fated stock closed at 51â a drop of 40
points. Roughly the decline meant the
loss of a hundred million dollars to the
fifteen thousand shareholders. From ev
ery city of importance in ! the country
came tales more or less tragic of holdings
wiped out, of ruined families, of defalca
tions and suicides. The losses In New
York city alone were said to be fifty mil
lions. A few large holders, reputed to
enjoy inside information, were said to
have put their stock aside and "sold
ehort" in the knowledge of what was
coming. Such tales are always popular in
the street
Others not less popular had to do with
the reasons for the slump. Many were
plausible. A deal with the Rothschilds
for control of the Spanish mines had fal.
len through. Or, again, the slaughter
was due to the Bhepler group of Federal
Oil specuators, who were bent on forcing
come one to unload a great quantity of
the stock so that they might absorb it.
The immediate causes were less recon
dite. The Consolidated Company, so far
from controlling the output, was sudden
ly shown to control actually less than
CO per cent of It Its efforts to amend or
repeal the hardy old law of Supply and
Demand had simply met with the indif
ferent success that has marked all such
efforts since the first attempted corner

whatever It may have been. In the lan
guage of one of its newspaper critics, the
"Trust" had been "founded on miscon
ception and prompted along lines of self
destruction. Its fundamental principles
were the restriction of product, the in

lost $5,000,000 as nearly as he could calcu

sleep, he thought was disquieting.
Then upon the tape he read another
chapter of disaster. Western Trolley had
gone into the hands of a receiverâ a finÂ©,
fat, promising stock ruined without a
word of warning; and while he tried to
master this news the horrible clicking

Fouts, with a Blip of paper In his hand,
beckoned from the door of his private of

awakened from the dream that he had
been losing a fortune in his sleep.
Coming out after a few moments, he
went up to Uncle Peter, who had been
sitting, watchful but unconcerned. In one
of the armchairs along the wall. The old

Lost Elk's Charm Is Strangely
Recovered From Heathen's Grave
Â«^ EARLY two years ago E. G. Rlss-
man of this city, familiarly
I \| known to his friends as "Doc,"
I \ lost a valuable Elk charm in
V^ Portland, Or. It slipped off his
watchchain one night when he was walk-
Ing along the street. Vainly he searched
for it and advertised, offering a large
reward for Its return. Then he looked
upon it as gone for ever, and the loss of
the beautiful emblem was almost forgot
ten until the other day. when he received
It safe and sound from Wilson Beneflel,
superintendent of the Lone Fir Cemetery
in Portland. How the charm found Its
way back to its proper owner is one of
those true tales that stagger credulity.
â¢ The charm was the gift of Lodge No. 17
of Elks, whose cool, green pastures are
circumscribed by the boundaries of that
region known as Denver, Colo. It is com

bearing upon this same fortuity. .When

Two lnclosures fell out. One was a

waited In Mrs. Drelmer' s drawing-room

When that competent person sailed In.

brow. His heart sank to its low level of
the night before.
"Well, I saw the creature." 'she besran.

had feared It might be rather a delicate

Down at the hotel of Peter Bines was

That absurd old Peter Bines has spoken
to me of her three times lately. She's
made a lot more money than she had In
this same copper deal, and she'd a lot to
begin with. I wondered why he spoke so
enthusiastically of her. and I don't see
now, butâ'*
"WellT"
Mauburn's eyes opened widely.
He paced the floor while bis matrimo
nial adviser tapped a white kidded foot
on the floor and appeared to read plans of
a new battle In a mother-of-pearl paper
knife which she held between the tips of
her fingers.
"X have Itâ and wVU do it quickly Iâ

"But we'd have been so nicely set up,
even without the title, and now Bines,
the clumsy ass, has come this Infernal
cropper and knocked everything on the
head. I aay. you know It's beastly!"
"Hush, and let me think I"
He found that capable lady gowned for
the opera. Ehe received his bit of news
with the aplomb of a resourceful com
mander.
"Now, don't go seedy all at onceâ you've
a chance."
"Hang It all, Mrs. Drelmer, I've not.
Life Isn't worth livingâ "

Mauburn felt the rock foundations of
Manhattan Island to be crumbling to dust.
For an hour he eat staring at the mes
sage. He did not talk to himself once.
Then he hurriedly dressed, took the note
and the cablegram, and sought Mrs. Drel
mer.
"My son can do anything he makes up
his mind to." dedared Mrs. Binesâ "Just
anything he lays out to do."
They talked until late Into the night of
what he should "lay out" to do.
Meantime the Btronehold of Mauburn's
optimism was being desperately stormed.
In an evening paper he had read of Per
cival's losses. The afternoon press of
New York is not apt to understate the
facts of a given case. The account Mau
burn read stated that the young Western
millionaire had beggared his family.
Mauburn had gone to his room to be
alone with this bitter news. He had be
gun to face it when Psyche's note of re
lease came. While he was adjusting this
development another knock came on his
door. It was the tame maid who had
brought Psyche's note. This time she
brought what ha saw to be a cablegram.
"Excuse me, Mr. Mauburn.â now this
came early to-day and you wasn't in your
room, and when you came in Mrs. Fer
guson forgot it till Just now."
He tore open the envelope and read:
"Male twins born to Lady Casselthorpe.
Mother and sons doing finely.
"HINKIE."
"'Taln't a natural appetite, though."
he warned them. "It's a kind of a mania
before I go all to pieces. I s'pose."
"'Nonsense! We'll have you all right
la a. week." eaid PerclvaL "Just remem
ber that I'm going to take care of you."
Uncle Peter had first declared that the
thought of food sickened him. Prevailed
upon at last by Mrs. Bines to taste the
*oup, he was eoon eating as those present
had of late rarely seen him eat.
â¢â¢yeÂ« â you're right, I7nolÂ» Peter â I sup
pose It muit be doneâ but the poor fellow
really cares for me."
"Oh, of course." answered the old man.
"it'll fairly break his heart. You do it
Just tha samel"
She withdrew, and presently came back
with a note which she despatched to Mau
burn.
Perclval and his mother had continued
their dinner, the former shaking his head
between the Intervals of the old man's
lashings, and appearing to hold silent con
verse with himself.
This was an encouraging sign. It Is a
curious fact that peopla never talk to
themselves except triumphantly. In mo
ments of real despair we are inwardly
dumb. But observe the holders of imag
inary conversations. They are conquerors
to the last one. They administer sting
ing rebukes that leave the adversary
writhing. They rise to Alpine heights of
pure wisdom and power, leaving him to
flounder Ignobly in the mire of his own
fatuity. They achieve repartee the bril
liance of which dazzles him to contempti
ble silence. If statistics were at hand we
should doubtless learn that no man has
ever talked to himself eave by way of
demonstrating his own godlike superior
ity, and the tawdry Impotence of all ob
etades and opponents. Perclval talked to
himself and mentally lived the next five
years In a style that reduced Uncle Peter
to grudging but Imperative awe for his
superb gifts of administration. He bathed
In this Imaginary future as In the waters
of omnipotence. As time went on he
foresaw the shafts of Uncle Peter being
turned back upon him with such deadli
nes* that, by the time the roast came,
his breast was swelling with pity for that
6enile scoffer.
"First thing you'll do," said Unde
Peter, promptly, "you go write a letter
to that beau of your*n, tellln' him it's all
off. You don't want to let him be the one
to break It because you lost your money,
do you? You sign his release right this
minute."
old Mr. Chance went right off and left
you, that's what. I tell you, what some
folks need Is a breed of chances that'll'
Fiend without hitchin'."
Percival braced himself and began on
his coup.
"Never you mind, Unde Peter. You re
member what I told you."
"That takes a different man from what
you are. If your pa was alive nowâ"
"But what are we going to do?" cried
Psyche.
"Will he return West?"
"He will thatâ and the West Is the only
place fur him. He was gettin* bad notions
about his own country here from them
"I'm delighted to. hear it I've always
been taken with the chap; and I'm really
glad you read him correctly. It Beemed
to me you were taking a risk. It would
have broken the epirlt of most men."
"Well, you see, I knew the stock. It's
pushln', fightln' stock. My grandfather
fought his way west to Pennsylvania
when that country was wllder'n Africa,
and my father fought his way to Ohio
when that was the frontier. I seen some
hard times myself, and this boy's father
was a fighter, . too. So I -knew the boy
had it in him, all right. He's got his
faults, but they don't hurt him none."
"That ain't any name fur it. Why, he's
actin* this mornin* Jest like the world's
his oyster â and every month had an 'r*
in it at that."
' "Not its relative significance, Mr. Shep
lerâIt's plain damned insignificance, if
you'll excuse the word. If that boyM
gone on he'd 'a' been one of what Billy
Brue calls them high-collared Clarences
no good fur anything but to spend money
and get apoplexy or worse by 40. As it Is
now. he'll be a man. He's got his health
turped on like a steam radiator, he's full
of responsibility and he's really long
headed."
"How did he take the loss?"
"He acted Jest like a healthy baby does
when you take one toy away from him.
He cries a minute, then forgets all about
It and grabs up something els* to play
with. His other toy was bad. What he's
playln* with now will do him a lot of
pood."
"He's not discouraged thenâ he's really
hopeful?"
swelled up good and plenty."
"Well, I'm glad it's over, Mr. Bines. Ot
course, I concede the relative sigiuuu*JiiwÂ»
of money to a young man of his quali
ties " â¢
well to ease up a little after he's out
there? You might let it be understood
that I am willing to finance any of -those
propositions there liberallyâ"
"No, noâ that ain't the way to handle
him. Say, I don't expect to quit cusstn*
him fur another thirty days yet. I want
him to think he ain't got a friend on
earth but himnelf. Why, I'd have made
this play Just as I have done. Mr. Shep
ler, if there hadn't been a chance to get
back a cent of itâ if we'd had to go plumb
brokeâ back to the West in an emigrant
car. with bologna and crackers to eat,
that's what I'd have done. No, sir: no
help fur him!"
"Aren't you a little hard on him?" '
"Not a bit; don't I know the stock, and
know Just what he needs? Most men
you couldn't treat as I'm treating him:
but with him, the harder you bear down
on him the more you'll get out of him.
That was the way with his paâ he was
a different man after things got to com
ln' too easy fur him. This fellow, the way
I'm treatln' him. will keep his head even
after he gets things comin' easy again,
or I miss my gruess. He thinks I despise
him now. If you told him I was proud of
him I almost believe you could get a bet
out of him, sick as he is of gamblin'."
."Has he suspected anything?"
"Sure not! Why, he Just, thanked me
about an hour ago fur savin' himâ made
me shake hands with himâ and I could
see the tears back in his eyes."
The old man chuckled.
"It was like Len Carey's Nigger Jim.
Len had Jim set apart on the plantation
fur his own nigrer. They fished and went
huntln* and swlmmln' together. One day
they'd been swlmmin' and was lyin" up on
the bank. Len got thinkln' he'd never
seen any one drown. He knew Jim
couldn't swim a lick, so he thought he'd
have Jim go drown. He says to him,
â¢Jim. go Jump off that rock there.' That
was where the deep hole was. Jim was
scar't, but he- had to go. After he'd gone
"He knows something about that one.
all right, if he knows she. wouldn't have
any use for me now. Shepler's coming on
with the ladles. I feel quite hopeful
about him."
"Well, son, I ain't no ways alarmed
but what you'll soon be on your feet
again in that respectâ say by next Tues
day or Wednesday. I wish the money
was comln" back as easy."
"Well, there are girls in Montana City."
"You could no worse. That reminds me
âI happened to meet Shepler to-day and
he got kind of confidentialâ talkin* over
matters. He said he'd never really felt
sure about the affections of a cer
tain young woman, especially after
that night at the Oldakers'â he'd
never felt sure of her until you
went broke. He said you never could
know anything about a womanâ not
really."
"Well." said Uncle Peter to Percival
later in the evening, "Pish has done bet
ter than you have here. It's a pity you
didn't pick out some good sensible girl
and marry her In the midst of your other
doings."
"I couldn't find one that licked cats. I
saw a lot that suited every other way,
but I always said to myself, 'Remember
Uncle Peter's warning!' so I'd go to an
animal store and get a basket of kittens
and take them around, and not one of the
dozen stood your test. Of course, I'd
never disregard your advice."
â¢ "Hum," remarked Uncle Peter, In a
tone to be noticed for its extreme dry
ness. "Too bad, thoughâ you certainly
need a wife to take the conceit out of
you."
"I lost in the Street, along with the
rest." .
"You shouldn't," she reassured him.
"That's only Uncle Peter's way of saying 1
you can 'help the others, even If you can't
do much yourself at first. And won't
Mrs. Drelmer be delighted to know it's
all settled?"
"Well, come on! If yotr can't skin your
self: you can hold a leg. while somebody
else skins. But you ain't met my ex
pectations, I'll say that." And he shook
hands cordially. with the Englishman.
"I say, you know," said Mauburn later
to Psyche, "why should I skin myself?
Why should I be skinned at all, you
know?"
"Fact! Say, It must have been an aw
ful blow to him when hÂ» found sis
'wouldn't think of him at all without his
title, even if she was broke. They had
a stormy time of it from all I can hear.
He said he was strong enough to work
and all that, and since he'd cared for her
and not for her money it was low down
of her to throw him over; then she said
Â¦he wouldn't leave her mother and us,
now that we might need her, not for him
or any other manâ and he said that only
made him love her all the more, and then
he got chesty and said he was Just as
good as any American, even if he never
would have a title; so pretty soon they
got kind of Interested in each other again
and by the time I came home It was all
over. They ratified the preliminary agree
ment for a merger."
"Well, I snum!"
"That's right, go ahead and snum. I'd
snum myself if I knew howâ it knocked
me. Better come upstairs and congrat
ulate the happy couple." . ,
"Shoo, now! I certainly am mighty
disappointed in that fellow. Still he Is well
spotted, and, them freckles mean iron in
the blood. Maybe we' can develop him
along with the other properties."
They found Psyche already radiant,
though showing about her eyes traces of
the storm's devastations. Mauburn was
looking happy; also defiant and stub
born.
"Mr. Bines." he said to Uncle Peter, "I
hope you'll side with me. I Â»now some
thing about horses, and I've nearly a
thousand pounds that I'll be glad to put
In with you out there if you can make a
place for me."
The old man looked him over quizzical
ly. Psyche put her arm through Mau
burn's.. ;Â¦'--- Â¦Â¦Â»Â¦'Â¦
"I'd have to marry some one, you
know, Uncle Peter!"
"Don't apologize. Pish. There's room
for men that can work out there, Mr.
Mauburn, but there ain't any vintages or
trouserings to speak of, and ' the hours
is long."
'Try me. Mr. Bines!"
"Get out!"
of an alliance with Mrs. Wybert, when
the fortunte should be lost, had. after all,
been an incidentâ a means of showing the
girl,' If she should prove to be too deeply
Infatuated with Mauburn for her own
peace of mlnd-rhow unworthy and mer
cenary he was; for he had meant, in that
event, to disillusion her by disclosing
something of Mrs. Wyberfs historyâ the
woman Mauburn should prefer to her.
He still c6unted confidently on the loss
of the fortune suffldng to break the
match.
When he reached the HIghtower that
night for dinner, he found Perclval down
stairs in great glee over what he con
ceived to be a funny situation.
"Don't ask me. Uncle Peter. I couldn't
get it straight: but as near as I could
make out, Mauburn came up here afraid
the blow of losing him was going- to kill
sis with a broken heart, and sis wa3
afraid the blow was going to kill Mau
burn, because she wouldn't have married
him anyway, rich or poor, after he'd lost
the title. They found each other out
some way and then Mauburn accused her
of being heartless, of caring only for his
title, and she accused him of caring only
for her money, and he insisted she ought
to marry him anyway, but she wouldn't
have it because of the twinsâ"
Uncle Peter rubbed his big brown hands
with the first signs of cheerfulness he had
permitted Perclval to detect In him.
"Good fur Pishâ that's the way to take
down them conceited Britishersâ"
"But then they went at matters again
from a new standpoint and the result is
they've made it up."
"What? Has them precious twin Cas
oelthorpes perished?"
"Not at all, both doing finelyâ haven't
even had colicâ growing fastâ probably
learned to say 'fancy, now/ by this time.
But Mauburn's going West with us if
we'll take him."
Perclval smiled as he resumed his walk
âsmiled with all that bitter cynicism
which only youth may feel to Its full
polgnance. Yet, heartless as she was. he
recalled that while she talked to him he
had Imprinted an Imaginary kiss delib
erately upon her full scarlet lips. And
now, too, he was forced to confess that.
In spite of his very uncertain knowledge
about her, he would actually prefer to
have communicated it through the recog
nized physical media. He laughed again,
more cheerfully.
"The spring has got a strangle-hold
on my Judgment." he said to himself.
"Good-by, Mr. Bines."
"Good-by. young man." Shepler shook
hands with him cordially, "and the best
of luck to you out there. I shall hope to
hear good reports from you. And mind,
you're to look us up when you're In town
again. We shall always be glad to see
you. Good-by."
The accepted lover looked Miss Mllbrey
over with rather a complacent airâ with
the unruffled confidence of assured pos
session. Perclval fancied there was a
look almost of regret in the girl's eyes..
"I'm afraid." said Shepler, "your annt
doesn't want to be kept waiting. And
she's already in a fever for fear you
won't prefer the necklace she Insist* you
ought to prefer."
"Tell Aunt Cornelia, please, that Z shall
be along In Just a moment."
"She's quite - Impatient, you knoTr,"
urged Shepler.
Perclval extended his hand.
"Good-by, Miss Mllbrey. Don't let ma
detain you. Sorry I shall not see you
again."
She gave him her hand uncertainly, aa
if she had still something to say, but
could find no words for it.
"And we're leaving for the country
ourselves. Papa and mamma co to-mor
rowâand/ Mr. Bines, I should have liked
another' talk with youâ I wish we were
dining at the Oldakers* again."
He observed Shepler strolling toward
them.
"I shall be staying with Aunt Cornelia
a few days after to-morrow."
Shepler came up.
"And I shall be leaving to-morrow,
Miss Mllbrey."
"Ah, Bines, glad to see you!"
"They can wait. Mr. Bines, I wonder
If you have quite a correct Idea of all
.New York people?*'
"Probably not; I've met so few, you
know "
"Well of courseâ but of those you've
met?"
"You can't know what my ideas are."
. "I wish we might have talked moreâ
I'm sureâ when are you leaving?"
"I shall leave to-morrow."
"Surely, Mr. Bines, no one here could
think less of you. Indeed, I think more
of you. I think it's fine and big to go
back with such courage. Do you know, I
wish I were a manâ I'd show them!"
"Really. Miss Mllbreyâ" ,
He looked over her shoulder again and
saw that Shepler was waiting for her.
"I think your friends axe Impatient."
He looked over her shoulder, in where
Shepler and Mrs. Van Geist were Inspect
ing a tray of Jewels.
"Of course not Impertinent â very kind â
only I'm really not In need of any sym
pathy at all. You won't understand it;
but we don't care so much for money In
the Westâ for the loss of Itâ not so much
as you New Yorkers would. Besides we
can always make a plenty more."
The situation was. emphatically, not as
he had so often dreamed It when she
should marvel, perhaps regretfully, over
his superiority to her husband as a mon
ey-maker. His only relief was to belittle
the importance of his loss.
"Of course we've lost everything, al
mostâbut I've not been a bit downcast
about it. There's more where it came
from, and no end of fun going after It.
I'm looking forward to the adventures, I
can tell you. And every one will be glad
to see me there; they won't think the
less of me, I assure you, because I've
made a fluke here!"
She stood, flushed with pleasure, radi
ant In stuff of filmy pink, with little
flecks at her throat and waist of the first
tender green of new leaves. She was
unaffectedly delighted to see him.
"You are Miss Spring?" he said when
she had given him her hand, '"and you've
come into all your mother had that was
worth Inheriting, haven't you?"
"Mr. Bines, shall we not see you now?
I wanted so much to talk with you when
I heard everything. Would it be imperti
nent to say I sympathized with you?"
He would have passed on, but Miss
Mllbrey had seen him. and stood waiting
in the doorway while Shepler and Mrs.
Van Gelst went on into the store.
"Mr. Binesâ I'm so glad!"
""All right. Uncle Peterâ and I hope
I'll have a grandson that thinks as much
of it as I ,do of yours."
When they had gone he went back to
the work of final adjustment. He had the
help of Coplin. whom they had sent for.
With him ho was busy for a week. By
lucky sales of some of the securities that
had been hypothecated they managed to
save a little; but. on the whole. It was
what Percival described it, "a lovely au
topsy."
At last the vexatious work was finished,
and ho was free again. At thÂ« end of thÂ«
final day's work he left the office of Fouts
In Wall street and walked up Broadway.
He went slowly, enjoying; the freedom
from care. It was the afternoon of a day
when the first summer heat had been felt,
and as he loitered before shop windows or
walked slowly through that street where
all move quickly and most very hurried
ly, a welcome little breeze came up.
At Union Square, when he would have
taken a car to go the remainder of the
distance, he saw Shepler, accompanied
by Mrs. Van Geist and Miss Mllbrey,
alight from a victoria and enter a Jew
eler's.
"Take care of yourself," said Uncle
Peter at parting. "You know I ain't any
good any more, and you got a whole fam
ily, lncludin' an Englishman, dependln" on
youâ we'll throw him on the town,
though. If he don't take out his first
papers the minute I get there."
His last shot from the rear platform
was:
"Change your name back to 'Pete,' son,
when you get west of Chicago. 'Taint
anything fancy, but it's a crackin' good
business name fur a hustlerl"
Percival saw them to the train.
in' up in Central Park some night and
took off right to the calaboose. I Just got
to get out again where you can feel the
wind blow and see a hundred miles and
don't have to dodge horseless horse care
every minute. It's a wonder one of 'em
ain't got me in this town. You come on
in the car, and do the style fur the fam
ily. One of them common Pullmans is
good enough fur Marthy and me. And
besides. I got to get Billy Brue back. He's
goln' plumb daft lookln* night and day
fur that man that -got his thirty dollars
and his breastpin, i-e says there'll bÂ«
an ambulance backed up at the spot
where he meets himâ makes no difference
if it's right on Fifth avenue. Billy's kind
of near-sighted at that, bo I'm mortal
afraid he'll make a mistake one of these
nights and take some, honest man's
money and trinkets away from him."
THE SUNDAY CALL.
Concluded Next Week.
"I'm too restless to stay," dedared Un
cle Peter. "I declare, with spring all
greenln' up this way I'd be found camp-
But his persuasions were unavailing.
"I can't stand It another day," . said
Mrs. Bines, "and those letters keep com
ing in from poor suffering; people that
haven't heard the news."
"It's like starting West again to make
our fortune," said Uncle Peter. Â« He had
suffered himself to regaain something of
his old cheerfulness of manner. .
"I wish you two would wait until they
can get the car here, and go back with
me," said Perclval. "We can go back in
style even If we didn't save much more
than a getaway stake."
Uncle Peter and Mrs. Bines had now
determined to go, leaving Perclval to fol
low when he had closed his business af
fairs.
The BIneses, with the exception of
Psyche, were at breakfast a week later.
Miss Bines had been missing since the
day that Mr. and Mrs. Cecil G. H. Mau
burn had left for Montana City to put
the Bines home in order.
CHAPTER XXXVIL
folks that's always crackin ' up the
'other side* 'slf there wa'n't any 'this
side* worth speakin* of In company. * This
was no place fur him. Mr. Shepler,
this whole country is God's country. I
don't talk much about them things, but
I believe in Godâ a man has to if he
lives so much alone in them wild places
as I have â and I believe tnis country is
his favorite. I believe he set it apart fur
great works. The history of ttie United
States bears me out so fur. And I didn't
want any of my etoc : growln' up with
out feelin' that he had the best native
land on earth, and without' bein' ready
to fight fur it at the drop of the hat.
And lest between you and me, I believe
we can raise that kind in the West bet
ter'n you can here in New York. You
got a fine, handsome town here: It's a
corkln' good place to seeâ and get ' out of
âbut it ain't any breedln* placeâ there
ain't the room to grow. Now we produce
everything in the West, lncludin* , men.
Here you don't do anything but consume,
lncludin' men. If the West stopped pro
ducln' men fur you you'd be as bad off
as if it stopped producin' food. You can't
grow a big man on this Island any more
than you can grow wheat , out there on
Broadway. You're all right. You folks
have your uses. I ain't like one of these
crazy Populists that thinks you're rascals
and all like that: but my point is that
you don't get the fun out of life. You
don't get the big feelln's. Out in the
West they're the flesh and blood and
bone; and you people here, meanin'.no
disrespectâ you're the dimples and wrin
kles andâ the warts. You spend and gam
ble back and forth with that money we
raise and dig out of the.' ground, and
you think you're gettin' the best end of
It, but you ain't*: I found that out thirty
two years ago this spring. /I had a crazy
fool notion then to go back: there even
when I hadn't cone brokeâ and I dona
well to ro. And that's why I wanted
that bov back there. And that's why
I'm mighty proud of him, to see he's so
hot to go and take hold, like I knew he
would' be." v
"That's excellent Now, Mr.' Bines," I
like him and I dare say you've done the
best thin* for him, unusual as It was.
But don't grind him. Might It not bo

you damn nigger!' and Jim come up and
went down twice more. Then Len begun
to think Jim was worth a good bit ol
money, and mebbe he'd be almighty wal
loped If the truth come out, so he dives
In after Jim and gets him to shore, and
after while he brought him to. Anyway,
he said Jim had already sure-enough
drowned as fur as there was any fun in
it. WÂ«U, Len Carey is an old man now.

relatives old Nigger Jim hunts him up
with tears In his eyes and thanks Mister
Leonard fur savin' his 'life that time.
Sty. I felt this mornin' like Len Carey
must feel them times when Jim's thank
ih' him."
Shepler laughed.
"You're a rare man. Mr. Bines. I'll hope
to have your cheerful.' easy views of life
if I ever lose my hold here In the Street.
I hope I'll have the old Bines philosophy
and the young Bines spirit. That reminds
me," he continued as Uncle Peter rose to
go, "we've been pretty confidential. Mr.
Bines, and I don't mind telling you I was
a bit afraid of that young mm until yes
terday. Oh| not on the stock proposition.
On another matter. You may have no
ticed that night at the Oldakers'â well,
women," Mr. Bines, are uncertain. I know
something about markets and the ways of
a dollar, but all I know about women is
that they're good to have. You can't
know any more about them, because they
don't know any more, themselves. Just
between us, now, I never felt any too sure
of a certain young woman's state of mind
until copper reached 61 and Union.Cord
age had been blown up from inside."
They parted with warm expressions of
good will, and Uncle Peter, In high spirits
at the success of his machinations, had
himself driven up town. . ,,;
The only point where his plans had failed
was In Mrs. Wybert' s refusal to" consider
Mauburn after the birth of the Cassel
thorpe twins. Yet he felt that matters. In
spite of this happening:, must go as he
wished them to. The Englishmanâ Uncle
Peter cherished the strong anti-British
sentiment ' peculiar . to ; his - Â¦ generation
would surely, never inarry. a girl who. was
all but penniless,' and the consideration
Hs was ushered Into Bhepler's office af
ter a llttlo delay. The two men shook
hands warmly. Undo Peter was grinning
now with rare enjoyment â he who had In
the presence of the family shown naught
but broken age and utter despondency.
"You rough-housed the boy considerable
yesterday." .
"I never believed the fellow would hold
on." eald Shepler. "I'm sure you're right
In a way about the "West. There Isn't an
other man In this section who'd have
plunged as he did. Really, Me Bines, the
Street's never known anything like it.
Hero are those matters."
He handed the old man a dozen or so
certified checks on as many different
banks. Each check had many figures on
it Unde Peter placed them In his old
leather wallet.
"I knew he'd plunge," he said, taking
the chair proffered him, near Shepler's
desk. "I knew he was a natural born
plunger, and I knew that once he gets an
Idea In his head you can't blast It out;

that way. Then, of course, he wasn't
used to money and he was ignorant of
this game, and he didn't realize what he
was doing. He sort of distrusted himself
along toward the lastâ but I kept him
"Me? 6hucks.no! I'm Jest a poor, bro
ken old man, now. I'm goln' down to thÂ»
square IX I can walk that fur, and set
on a bench In the sun."
Uncle Peter did succeed In walking as
far as Madison Square. He walked, in
deed, with a step of amazing springiness
for a man of his years. But there, instead
of reposing In the sun. he entered a cab
and was driven to the Vandevere build-
Ing, where he sent In his name to Rulon
BheDlar.
Undo Peter next morning was up to a
late breakfast with the stricken family.
Perclval found him a trifle less bitter, but
not less convinced In his despair. The
young man himself had recovered his
eplrits wonderfully. The utter collapse of
the old man, always so reliant before,
had served to fire all hl3- latent energy.
He was now voluble with plans for the
future; not only determined to reassure
Uncle Peter that the family would be
provided for. but not a Uttle anxious to
Justify the old man's earlier praise and
refute his calumnies of the n'.ght before.
"You're right. Uncle Peter. It certainly
wasn't my game. Will you come down
with me?"

in here last week.
Of course clothes don't make the man- but they make all of him except his hands and face during business
hours, and that's a pretty considerable area of the human animal. A dirty shirt may hide a pure heart, but it seldom
covers a clean skin. If you look as if you slept in your clothes, most people will jump at the conclusion that you
have, and you. will never get to know them well enough to explain that your head is so full of noble thoughts that
you haven't time to bother with the dandruff on your shoulders. And if you wear blue and white striped pants
and a red necktie you will find it difficult to get close enough to a deacon to be invited to say grace at his table,
even if you never play for anything except coffee or beans.
Appearances are deceitful. I know, but so long as they are, there's nothing like having them deceive for us
instead of against us. I've seen a ten-cent shave and a five-cent shine get a thousand-dollar job, and a cigarette
and a pint of champagne knock the bottom out of a million-dollar pork corner. Four or five years ago little Jim
Jackson had the bears in provision pit hibernating and living on their own fat till one morning, the day after he had
run the price' of mess pork up to twenty dollars and nailed it there, some one saw him drinking " a small bottle
just before he. went on 'Change; and told it round among the brokers on the floor. . The bears thought
Jim must have had bad news to be bracing up at that time in the morning, so they perked up and everlastingly
sold the mess pork market down through the bottom of the pit to solid earth. There wasn't even a grease spot left
of that corner when they got through. As it happened, Jim. hadn't had any bad news; he just took the drink
because he felt pretty good and things were coming his way. ' -

' tm fc 7 """ 1 "i"i*-*i A long course of study of the
works of Lillian Bell, the late Mary ,
Jane Xanthippe and other .classic authors had fitted ,
her to deal with the common or garden husband
in a manner that should be an example to all her
suffering sisters. In the first place her husband
should have no secrets from' her; that was the first'
and great commandment. In the second place he should
be duly landed at the family fireside by 6 o'clock every <
evening; a special dispensation for a run around the block '
after dinner might be granted in case of unusual need, but ',
10 o'clock at the outside should see him sitting in the shade \
ol his own vine and hat tree. (
If he desired amusement a simple little game of back- \
gammon with a small lunch of Chocolate and wafers . was ,
recommended by the best authorities as calculated to an- .
swer all requirements. If he yearned for more elaborate
dissipation an occasional icecream jag at a Sunday-school '
sociable or a street car ride into the country on a Sunday '
afternoon might be allowed, but never without his running |
mate to set the pace for him. Her idea of the management
of the exchequer was that John Henry should turn over
his little yellow envelope to her every Saturday night, with
a rebate of $3 75 for carfare and lunch.
For the first month or two after the setting of the hon
eymoon John Henry showed no signs of kicking over the
traces or even pulling on the bit. In fact, he was about the
most docile family animal that could have been found in
any stable. Mrs. J. H. was sure that she had struck pay
dirt on the first try, and she even began to block out an
essay for the next meeting of the Association for the Sup
pression of Husbands showing how she did the trick. But
one sad day her plans were badly mangled; John Henry tele
phoned up that a friend from the West had dropped in on
him and that he would be at the office late talking business.
The friend from the West was a new card to her. and she
faintly suspected a cold deck, especially when hubby trun
dled in about an hour on the wrong side of midnight and
tried to bring the banisters upstairs with him.
After the friend from the West had evaporated John
Henry stayed quietly on the reservation for a few weeks
until the longing came upon him once more for the festive
highball when it is high, and even for a certain festive little
game thafis also likely to be high, and he prepared to sally
forth to meet another friend at the club. This time Mrs.
J. H. put her foot down and J. H. was under it. He
was informed in accents that were calm but painfully firm '
that the modern conception of a happy home required that
the alleged head of the house should be making g!ad the
household with his presence every blessed evening.
Being a man and therefore of a sweet,- reasonable disposi
tion â also realizing that the only way to avoid- being beaten
in an argument with a woman is to keep out of the argu
ment â John Henry surrendered with all on board and swore
that he would never venture outside the house without a
nurse, so help him, Brigham Young.
\ ipagMMgwr F we could only round off the corners
HT/Â£^j|pÂ§^rj and smooth down the protuberances
fl YsÂ® if^V?f I ot our fellow-men what a nice, easy
Â¦ â¢N^H 3^^* wor ld this would be to live in. So
J?it(ff a^)l\ many of our companions and acquain
&ii&yM^j\i\{ tances are so delightful up to a certain
j P^ 1 -^â^h^-â '. point that we grieve because they lack
I the one thing more that would make
i them entirely satisfactory and congenial. That minister who
, preaches such superb sermons â if he only would come out
1 of his shell when he is in society and show us the human
, side that we know he has. That neighbor who drops in
every day or two â she's a very intelligent and interesting
woman, but if she only wouldn't stay quite so long. That
grocery clerk who persists in whistling **Mr. Dooley" every
time he comes up the walk to take the daily orderâ why
can't he be a little less boisterous?
Behind all this sort of criticism of those with whom we
have to do more or less constantly there is a fair measure
of justice and often of righteous indignation. But there arc
certain counter considerations. In the first place it is selfish
and risky business to erect one's own tastes and preferences
as the standard to which one would have all his fellow mor
tals in their various spheres of activity attain.
Who are you that you should aspire to be the norm for
your equals, not to say your betters? If you could once
succeed in inducing those about you to cherish exactly the
same feelings and interests which you cultivate, what a
monotonous world you would live in forever afterward. I
can't imagine anything much more trying, not to say nau
seating, than to find duplicates of myself wherever I went.
One such parson as I is amply sufficient for my community.
The charm and the zest of life arise from the fact that no
two persons are cast in the same mold. I know some peo
ple who tire occasionally of their children because they
are so much like themselves, because they see in them the
reappearance of their own weaknesses and foibles. So when
you are prone to lament the defects of others just analyze
sharply your desire to have them different from what they
are and find out if it is not at bottom a selfish yearning.
... Then again we must rememLer that while we might
like a certain individual if he were just a little different in
this particular or that." other people may like him just be
cause of this peculiarity. Not everybody likes to have his
minister come up and slap him on the back and say.
'Hullo, old man." That whistling of your grocer's clerk
that bores you so may be to some otl.or housewives on the
street a pleasant bugle call to the duties of the day. Of
course I am not talking now about radical faults and vices
of character, but about idyiosyncrasies and mannerisms of
a good many people we know.
1 Probably all the while you are wishing that John or
Jane were just a little different John or Jane or somebody
else 11 wishing that you were different, too. The truth is,
you would be a more admirable person. In fact, you would
be almost perfect if you would overcome that little habit
of forgetfulness or cynicism or vanity or if you would take
yourself seriously in hand at some other weak point of your
Meanwhile the simple lesson for this Sunday morning
is this: Let us value our friends and acquaintances for what
they are and not be forever sorrowing over what they are
not.

FABLES FOR THE
FOOLISH
By Nicholas Nemo.
IF PEOPLE WERE
DIFFERENT
By this time Mrs. J. H. was convinced that she had him
properly roped and branded. With a little care she would
soon have him so* domesticated that he could .tell the differ
ence between a lambrequin and an ordinary tidy, and he
might even become able to detect slight differences in
dress goods. In the course of time he might be real use
ful round the house. Every night she would trip him up
and tie him in a large Morris chair with his feet on a
hassock â whatever that is â and an adult copy of Bryce's
"American Commonwealth" under his nose. For it was in
the plot that a part of each evening should be given up to
mutual improvement. Hubby was inclined to the belief that
ten hours a day in an office with a typewriter at one hand
and a telephone at the other and the head of the firm yelling
at him every fifteen minutes because he couldn't occupy two
positions in Â«pace at the same time was about all the im
provement that one man was entitled to. but being fairly
wise and likewise passing patient he held his peace in both
hands and said nothing.
As the days passed Mrs. J. H. noticed that John Henry
was not quite so appreciative of new gowns and fancy din
ners and other choice blessings of Providence as he had
been in the first blush of wedded bliss. At times he mani
fested a desire to make suggestions as to the proper way to
broil a steak, and even showed symptoms of an idea about
the correct way to trim a hat or to perform the toilet for a
lettuce salad.
Then she lifted her eyes and cast them carefully around
the neighborhood to see how other women were solving the
puzzle. Much to her surprise she discovered that the pres
ident of the Association for the Suppression of Husbands
allowed her better half to' go to the club whenever the fit
seized him. and if it didn't seize him often enough she was
likely to do something to bring it on. Other women whom
she knew to be possessed of very advanced views on the
care of husbands seemed perfectly content to let the partners

of their joys and sorrows go out ever and anon, if not
oftener. and mingle with their fellow-men without being
chaperoned by an alarm clock or a pedometer.
When she had looked her fill she went home and took
two or three long thinks. Could she have been playing a
lone hand against the universe in her treatment of John
Henry? Just as a flyer she suggested one night that he
seemed to be in need of fresh air. When the aforesaid John
Henry recovered from the shock he gathered in his hat with
the faraway expression of a man who has found a pocket
book on the street and wants to make every one believe that
he dropped it himself and sneaked out into the circumam
bient atmosphere. When 'he came down late to breakfast
the next morning carrying his head as though it contained
something valuable she smiled sweetly and remarked that
it was a very warm morning. A few days later she cheer
fully agreed with him that he was looking run down and
that a fishing trip was what he needed to put him on his
feet again.
In divers and other ways he paid out the line so fast
that he actually began to wonder if he were really
hooked. If he wanted to stay at home of an evening she
was sure to think of a place just around the corner where
there was something on the ice. and he generally went out
to help take it gf[. For six thirsty, headachy months Mr*.
J, H. made the poor man go the rounds so often that he'
hardly knew how his own home looked. Strong drink be- <
came a drug on the market with him and he would bolt at (
the sight of a pile of chips in a lumber-yard. The old days
of backgammon and icecream debauches seemed like a (
dream of vouthful innocence. <
In the Father Hecker case the attack on American Catholics was made by Frenchmen instead of Germans. Father
Hecker was one of the celebrated Bound Brook colonists, who. it will be remembered, included among their members
George William Curtis and Charles Dana. He was a Protestant, but became a Catholic and a priest and founded
the order of Paulists, whose house in this city is connected with old St. Mary's Church on California street. A life
of Father Hecker had been written by one of his brethren and a copy of it fell into the hands of some French clergy
man, who evidently had not a very clear knowledge of the English language, but who- nevertheless undertook to
translate the work into French. The French version was very violently attacked by some French writers for its
unsound theological theories, which they denounced as "Americanisms." ThÂ« matter was called to the attention of
the Pope, who in a letter on the subject condemned the views as set forth in the French book, but intimated that
they were not to be considered in any way Americanisms, since the American Catholics were as sound and orthodox
as their critics. He took occasion to praise America and her institutions at the same time.
Of the assistance which the Pope gave this Government in the adjusting of numerous difficulties in Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Philippines little need be said, since it is too recent to need repetition. It is worthy of remark,
however, that one of the last things he did was to appoint American-born Bishops as the successors to the Spanish
Bishops in the islands, and 'his representative is now busy adjusting the friar and church land difficulty at Manila.
It may also be mentioned in this connection that a special college is to beâ and perhaps has beenâ established at New
Orleans especially tOAtrain American priests for the missions in the new possessions of the United States.
Besides these more important matters Leo XIII has shown on numerous occasions his admiration for America
and Americans. One of his first pontifical acts was to establish through the Propaganda a system for the trial of
cases arising between the clergy and their Bishops. In order that there might be no need to appeal to Rome, an
expensive and slow process, he created, as'has been said, a resident delegate in this country, who resides at Wash
ington, and who is practically in niany respects an American Pope. In school matters, while he has never ceased to
insist on the importance of a Christian education, he has never indorsed, either personally or through his delegate, the
extremists, but has declared that church and state should aid each other in the education of youth, and that a way
can be found to satisfy the demands of both. Mgr. Satolli, for instance, it may be mentioned, visited the schools in
Minnesota which were under the so-called Faribault system â that is to say, which were owned and built by the Catho
lics, but were under the control of the public school authorities, religious instruction being given after school hours.
The papal delegate approved the plan,x and as all his acts were indorsed by the Pope, Leo evidently approved of the
scheme also.
The Catho*lic University at Washington, one of the great institutions of learning in the country, owes much to
his encouragement and approval.
At the World's Fair of 18Q.3 no exhibit attracted more attention than that sent at the special request of this Gov
ernment by the Pope, replete as it was with historical souvenirs of priceless value.
To an American, Dr. Frank G. Dossert, was accorded during the papal jubilee ten years ago the unique honor
of having a mass composed by him sung in St. Peter's on St. Joseph's day before a vast congregation. In the
whole history of the church such an honor had never been accorded any one except Italian composers. It was also
the first recognition of American musical genius in Europe. In congratulating the doctor after the services the Pope
said to him: "My love for America has grown with years. I hope to see Italy equally free and happy. I desire to
emphasize the fact that the church has been and is the patron of art and music and to encourage their srrowth in the
United States." - . JOHN F. CARRERE.
was the first delegate and was evidently directed by the Pope to carry out the same American policy, because he
decided every case brought before him against .Cahensleyism and forced Bishop Wigger of New Jersey and other Ger
man prelates to cease propagating those ideas and to re-establish English-speaking churches, which they had closed
in order to strengthen. neighboring German congregations.
Very few Protestant Americans know anything of this Cahensley movement, and many were the criticismsof the
Pope when he appointed a resident delegate in the United States, yet it is easy to see what an important service to
the social and political interests of the country the Pope performed when he insisted that all foreigners who came here
to live must be loyal, true, patriotic Americans, and must not attempt to introduce European languages and ideas in
the United States.
Â¦^Bas^acSs^j F the twenty odd Popes who have filled the chair of Peter since .Columbus discovered
>r55jSP^Sy?r?iJ America none have possessed more interest for the American people, irrespective of their relj
' Yb^^ 4^^&\) K' ous views, than Leo XIII. Although he never visited this country, and knew it consequently
"111 s-^^if * : ' on '-' k y w^ at l' e reac * an< * wnat ' 1C h ear^'' although he was an Italian by. birth and a European
/v&^-^^V' L)y C(^ ucat ' on anc * experience, Cardinal Gibbons, a native-born American, could not have better
5^?lÂ§s3p5<sf understood the spirit of the constitution or the temper of the American people than he did. Leo
â **' z^-^-ij not only understood the government and people of this country better than' any European ruler
has ever done, but he so compfetcly absorbed its ideas, its sentiments and its principles that his administration of
his high office, even in dealing with European powers, was along American rather than European lines.
In reviewing his pontificate irom an American standpoint three principal events in his reign at once suggest
themselves as of vital importance to the United States: His refusal to indorse racial distinctions in . the church in
this country; his definition of true and false Americanism in the Father flecker case; and his hearty' co-operation
with the American Government in the reconstruction of the old Spanish colonies on American lines. .
There were many other and almost as important matters for America settled satisfactorily by Leo; as for in
stance his moderation in handling the school question, always a delicate matter; -his establishment, of Â¦ a system ..for
the settling of disputes between the priests and Bishops, and his creation of a permanent legation in this country,
which in no way interferes with our policy of recognizing only de facto civil governments.
But the three first points are of particular importance, because if they had not been wisely, decisively and
quickly adjusted the results would not only have been disastrous for the church in this country, but -would have
proven a very serious impediment to the state in its complete assimulation of its foreign population â an -assimilation
so necessary* to its continued progress.
The first of these difficulties arose in this way: One Herr Cahensley, a German living in Ge/many. conceived
the idea, presumably, that that country had a corner on salvation and that the Lord would listen to no prayers said
in the English language if the prayer was by birth or descent not of an English-speaking nation. Accordingly he
sent a petition to the Pope asking him to order all Catholics in this country of European birth or parentage to'attend
only those churches where the sermons and instructions are in the native language of the immigrant, and that, fur
thermore, the children of immigrants should be forced to attend only schools taught in the foreign" tongue of the
parents; and that consequently so far as possible the new comer and his offspring be prevented from becoming Ameri
can in either sentiment, language or ideas. Singularly as it may seem, that foreign 'scheme was indorsed by some of
the foreign clergy in this country, but to their credit be it said by very few. The vast majority of the clergy, both
native and foreign, with Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland at their head, opposed it violently.
The plan of course was absurd on its face. It would have been impracticable, because the jurisdiction of each
Bishop (the Bishops were to be appointed according to Cahensley's idea by nationality and not by geographical lo
cation, and were to have jurisdiction only over those of their own nationality.) would have extended from New York
to San Francisco. There would have been as many dioceses in a given community as there were nationalities. In
New York or Chicago, for instance, there would have been English, Irish, French, German, Italian, etc.. Bishops,
each of whom would have bee'n kept busy rushing from one end of the country to the other hunting up his flock. If
there were a marriage of two, different nationalities it would have required a judgment of Solomon to have decided
the claims of the rival Bishoos to the spiritual control of the children.
The Pope at once considered the Cahensley petition and treated it with less consideration than any petition
had ever received at the hands of the Papacy. He declared that the church knew no races; that it was the duty of
Catholics to be true and loyal citizens of the country where they lived, abiding by its laws, supporting its govern
ment and speaking its tongue. He praised America and its constitution, and intimated very clearly that the foreigner
who came here to live and was not in thought and deed loyal to the republic was not a good Catholic, whatever else he
might be. More than that â he had already indorsed and approved the regulations of the Third Plenary Council of
Baltimore, which directed that everv Catholic should be taught the catechism in English, and that as speedily as pos
sible that lnnguage should be used for sermons and instructions in this country. Tile Pope furthermore appointed a
legate or apostolic delegate to personally represent him in this country. The famous Mgr. Satolli, now a Cardinal,.

At length, falling to get enough clients
In the ticker district itself, Gllmartln was
forced to advertise In an afternoon paper,
six times a week, and in the Sunday edi
tion of one of the leading morning dailies.
The advertisements ran like this:
the Up. But not so Gllmartln, who
retorted, wltheringly.
"Well. I've often heard of folk that
you put Into good things and they
make money and afterward % ihey
coma to you and tell you how darned
smart they were to hit It right. But
they can't work that on me. I've got
witnesses."
"Witnesses?" echoed Smlthcrs,
looking cheap. He renumbered.
"Yes, wit-ness-es." mimicked Gil*
martin, scornfully. "I all but hud to
get on my knees to make you buy It.
And I told you when to sell It, too.
The Information came to me straight
from headquarters and you got the
uae of It. and now the least you can
do Is to give me J2500."
In the end* he accepted $800/ ;
It seemed as though the regenera
tion of Gilmartln had been achieved
when he changed his shabby raiment
fqr expensive clothes. He paid his
tradesmen's bills and moved into let
ter quarters. He spent his money as
though he had made millions. One week
after he had closed out the deal his
friends would have sworn Glimartin had
always been prosperous. He began to
speculate again, in the office of Fret
man's brokers. ,
At the end of the second month he had
lost not only the $1200 ha had deposited
with the firm, but an additional $250 he
had clven his wife and had been obliged
to "borrow" back from her, despite her
assurances thnf he would lose It. This
time the slump was really unexpected by
all, so that the loss of the second fortune
did not reflect on Gllmartln's ability as a
speculator, but on his luck. As a matter
of fact, he had been too careful and had
sinned from" overtlmidity at first, only to
plunge later and lose all.
As the result of much thought about his
losses, Gilmartln became a professional
tipster. To let others speculate for him
seemed the only sure way of winning. Ha
began by advising ten victimsâ he learned
in time to call them clientsâ to sell Steel
Rod preferred, each man 100 shares, and
to a second ten he urged the purchase of
the same quantity of the same stock. To
all he advised taking four ' points' profit.
Not all followed hla advice, but the seven
clients who sold It made between them
nearly $3000 over night. His percentage
amounted to $287 60. Six bought, and when
they lost he told them confidentially how
the treachery of a leading member of the
pool had obliged the pool managers to
withdraw their support from the stock
temporarily, whence the decline. They
grumbled, but he assured them that he
himself had lost nearly $1600 of his own.
For some months Gilmartin made- a fair
living, but business became very dull.
People learned to tight shy of his tips.
Had hÂ« been able to make hla customers
alternate their winnings and losses he
might have kept his trade. But. for ex
ample, "Dave" Rosslter, in Stuart &
Sternjs office, stupidly received the wrong
tip elx times in succession. It wasn't Gll
martln's fault, but Rosslter's bad luck.
i
Btrange things happen in Wall Street.
Sometimes tips come true. It so proved
in this case. -Sharpe started the stock up
ward brilliantly â the movement became
historic . in the Streetâ and Pa. Cent,
soared dizzily and all the newspapers
talked of it and the public went mad over
it and it touched SO and 85 and 88 and
higher, and then , Gilmartin made his
brother-in-law sell out and Smithers and
Freeman. Their profits were: Griggs,
$3000; Smithers, $15,100; Freeman, $2760.
Gilmartin' made them give: htm a good
percentage. He . had no trouble with his
1 rother-ln-law, Gllmartln told him it was
an inviolable Wall Street custom, and so
Griggs paid with an air of much experi
ence in such matters. Freeman was more
or less , grateful. ~ But ' Smithers met Gil
martin and full of his good luck repeated
what he had told a dpzen men within an
hour: /;
"I did a dandy stroke the other day. Pa.
Cent, looked to me like higher prices, and
I bought a wad of it. I've cleaned up a
tidy sum." and be looked proud of his
own penetration. He really had forgotten
that it was Gilmartin who had given him
"I was there when the papers were
ftigned." Gllmartln said, hotly "I was go
ing to leave thn room, but Sam told me I
needn't. I can't tell you what it Is about;
really I can't. But he's simply going to
put the stock above par. Let me know
who is manipulating a stock, and. to hâ I
with dividends and earnings. Them's my
sentiments," with a final hammering
nod, as if driving In a profound truth.
"Same here," assented Freeman, cor
dially. He was attacked on his vulnerable
side. â¢ , Â¦ Â¦
"L"*.iarpe. The old boy sent for me. He
was in mighty good humor, too. Tick'ed
to death. He might well beâ he's got 60.
000 shares of Pennsylvania Central. And
there's going to be from 60 to 60 points
prptlt !ri It."
"Huh." sniffed Freeman, skeptically, yet
Impressed by the change in Gilmartin's
attitude from the money-borrowing hu
mility of the previous week to the confi
dent tone of a man with a straight tip*
Sharpe was notoriously kind to his old
friendsâ rich or poor.
"You're Just the man I was looking for,"
said Gllmartln, who hadn't thought of the
young man at all.
"Are you a deputy sheriff?"
"No." A slight pause, for oratorical ef
fect. "I had a long talk with Sam to
day."
"What Sam?"
Shortly after he left Smithers he but
tonholed another acquaintance, a young
man who thought he knew Wall street,
and therefore had a hobbyâ manipulation.
No one could induce him to buy stocks by
telling him how well the companies were
doing, how bright the prospects, etc. That
was the bait for "suckers," not for clever
ycung stock operators. But any one, even
a stranger, who said that "they"â the per
ennially mysterious "they," the "big
men." the mighty "manipulators" whose
life was one prolonged conspiracy to pu'.l
the wool over the public's eyesâ "they"
were poing to "Jack up" thesÂ« or the
other shares, was welcomed, and his ad
vice acted upon. . i . ;
"You want to keep in touch with me."
said Gilmartin. "I'll tell you what .Sharp?
tells me. But you must keep it quiet,"
with a side wise nod that pledged Smith
ers to honorable secrecy.
Had Gllmartln met Sharpe face to face
he would not have known who was before
him.
In lees than five minutes Smithers was
so wrought up that he bought C00 shares
and promised solemnly not to "take his
profits," J. e., sell out, until Gilmartln
paid the word. Then they had another
drink and another look st the ticker.
â¢â¢Why, when Sharpe makes up his mlrfd
tu put up a stock, Vs he Intends to do
with Pa. Cent., nothing on earth can stop
him. He told me he would make it croas
par within Eixty days. This Is no hear-
Eay, no tip. It's cold facts. I don't hear
It's .going up; I don't think it's going up;
1 know It's going up. Understand?"
"Yes. Sam Eharpe told"â Gllmartln was
on the point of saying a "friend of mine,"
but caught himself and went on impres
hlvelyâ"told me yesterday to buy Pa.
Cent., as he had accumulated his full line
ard was ready to whoop it up. And you
know what Sharpe is," he finished.
"Is that so?" nibbled Smithers. .
man's evident prosperity. H<5 felt ind!ff- â¢
nant at the ability of the o^her to buy
hundreds of shares. But the liquor
soothed him and in a burst of wild re
morse he told Smithers, after an appre
hensive look about him. as if he feared
some one might overhear: "I'll tell you
something on the dead q. t., for your own
benefit."
"Fire away!"
"Pa. Cent, is going 'way up."
"Yes*?" Eald Srnlthers. calmly.
"Yts; it will cross par, sure."
"L'mph!" between munches of a pretzel.
He became a Wall street "has been"
and could be seen daily on New street,
back of the Consolidated Exchange,
where the "put" and "call" brokers con
gregate. The tickers in the nearby sa
loons fed his gambler's appetite. , From
time to time luckier men took him into
the same betickered saloons, where he ate
st the free lunch counters and drank
beer and talked stocks and listened to the
lucky narratives with lips tremulous with
readiness to smile and grimace.
One day. In New street, he overheard a
very well known broker tell another that
Mr. Bharpe was "going to move up Penn
sylvania Central right away." The over
hearing of the conversation was a bit of
rare good luck that raised Gilmartin from
his sodden apathy and made him hasten
to his brother-in-law, who kept a grocery
etore In Brooklyn. He implored Griggs to
go to a broker and buy as much Pennsyl
vania Central as he couldâ that is. If he
wished to live In luxury tne rest of his
life. Sam Bharpe was going to put it up.
Also, he borrowed $10. ' . .
Griggs was tempted. He debated with
himself many hours, and at length yield
ed with misgivings. He took his savings
and bought 100 shares of Pennsylvania
Central at 64 and began to neglect his
business In order to study the financial
pages of the newspapers. Finally, he had
a telephone put In his little shop, to be
able to talk to his brokers.
QilmarUn, with the $10 he had bor
roved, promptly bought ten shares in a
bucket shop at 63%; the stock promptly
went to 62%; be was promptly "wiped,"
and the stock promptly went back to W&.
On the next dsy a fellow customer of
the Gilmartin of old days Invited him to
have a drink/ Gllmartln resented the
I-ater. it often came to pass that Gil
martin would borrow a few dollars, when
the customers were not trading actively.
The amounts he borrowed diminished by
reason of the increasing frequency of
their refusals. Finally, he was asked to
stay away from the office where once he
had been an honored and pampered cus
tomer.
When he returned to the broker's offlce
âthe next dayâ he began to speculate in
the only way he couldâ vicariously. Smith,
for instance, who was long of 5jO St.
Paul at 125, took less interest in the deal
than did Gilmartin, who thenceforth as
siduously studjec^ the new slips .and
eought information on St. Paul all over
the street, listening thrillingly to tips and
rumors regarding the stock, suffering
keenly when the price declined, laughing
and chirruping blithely if the quotation.}
moved upward, exactly as though it were
his own stock. Indeed. In sorni* cases his
lnter*st was so poignant and his advice
so frequentâ he would speak of our dealâ
tr-st the lucky winner gave him a Bma.ll
share of hln spoils, which Gilmartin ac
cepted without hesitationâ he was beyond
pride wounding by nowâ and promptly
used to back some miniature deal of his
own on the Consolidated Exchange, or
even In "Percy's"â a dingy bucket shop,
where they took orders for two shares of
etock on a margin of 1 per centâ that Is.
where a man could bet as little as two
dollars.
At first, after the fatal slump, Gilmar
tin importuned his brokers to let hm
speculate on credit in a small way. They
did. They were kindly enough men and
sincerely wished to help him. But luck
ran against him. With the obstinacy of
unsuperstltious gamblere. he insisted on
fighting fate. He was a bull In a bear
market; and the more he lost the more
he thought the inevitable "rally" in
prices was due. He bought in expectation
of it. and lost again and again until he
owed the brokers a greater sum than he
could possibly pay. and they refused point
blank to give him credit for another cent,
disregarding his \-ehement entreaties to
bu. a last hundred, just one more chance,
the last, because he would be sure to win.
And. of, course, the long expected hap
pened, and the market went up with a
rapidity that made the street blink; and
Gllmartln figured that, had not the brok
ers refused his last order, he would have
made enough to pay off the indebtedness
and have left in addition J2950. for he
would have "pyramided" on the way up.
He showed the brokers his figures accus
ir.gly. and they had some words about it
and he left the office almost tempted to
sue the firm for conspiracy with intent
to defraud.
days before the quotation board, gossiping
with those customers who had survived,
giving and receiving advice. And as time
passed the grip of Wall street on his
soul grew stronger until it strangled all
other aspirations. He could talk, think,
dream of nothing but stocks. He could
not read the newspapers without think
ing how the market would "take" the
news contained therein.
The atmosphere of the street, the odor
of speculation surrounded him on all
eldes, enveloped him like a fog, from
which the things of the outside world
appeared as though seen through a veil.
He lived in the district where men do
not say "Good-morning" on meeting one
another, but "How's the market?" or
when one asks "How do you feel?" re
ceives for an answer. "Bullish," or "Bear
ish," instead of a reply regarding the
state of health.

tt than this was the effect oi the poison
of gambling. A few lucky weeks In th*
ctock market would win him back all he
had lostâ and more!
From 10 to 3 they stood before the
quotation board and watched Â«Â± quick

one cr another of the customers read
Blond from the :a;t as it tame from the
ticker. The higher stocks went the more
numerous the customers became. All
were winning, for all were buying stocks
In a bull market. Ufe to all of them was
gull cf joy. The very ticker sounded
mirthful And Gilmartin and the other
customers laughed heartily at the mildest
cf stories without even waiting for the
point of the Joke. They were all neophytes
at tbe great game.
When the slump came all were heavily
committed to the bull side. It was a bad
s'.urap. It was so unexpectedâ by the
lambsâ that all of them said, very grave
ly. It came like a thunder-clap out of a
clear sky. While it lasted it was very
uncomfortable. Those same Joyous, win
ning stock gsrr.b'.trs, with beaming fact f,
of the week before, were fear-clutched,
losing ctock gamblers, with livid faces,
on what they afttrward tailed the day of
the panic It really was only a slump;
rather 6harper than usual. Too many
lambs had been over-speculating. The
Â« holesaJe dealers in securitiesâ rnd inse
curitiesâheld very littlt of their own
, wares, having sold ; Â¦.â¢ m to the Iambs
and wanted them back nowâ cheaper.
And so the fsst horses some h&d all but
' bought Joined the steam yachu others
almost had chartered. And the demollsher
cf dreams and dwelling was the ticker
that instead of golden jokes was now
clicking financial death.
Their own ruin, told in mournful num
bers by tbe little machine, fascinated
them. To be sure, poor Gilmartin said:
â¢'I've changed my mind about Newport.
I guess I'll spend the summer on my own
Hotel d* Hoof!" And he sxlnned: but
h* grinned alone. Wilson, the dry goods
man, who laughs so Joyously at every

under a hypnotic spell, the Ups of the
man who sat on the high stool beside the
ticker and called out the prices to the
quotation boy. Brown, the siender, pale
faced rcan was outside in the hall pacing
to and fro.' All was lost, including honor.
Gllmartln came out fxom the office, saw

Gllmartln had been eager to go to Wall
street But this leave-taking made him
sad. The old Gllmartln who had worked
with these men was no more and the new
Gilmartin felt sorry. He told them very
elraply he did not expect ever again to
tpend such pleasant years anywhere as at
the eld office. If he had his life to live
over again he would try really to deserve
all that they had said of him on this
evening. And be was very, very sorry to
leave them- "Very scrry, boys; very sor
ry. Very sorry!" he finished lamely, with
a wistful smile. He shook hands with
each manâ a strong grip as though he
were about to go en a Journey from
which he might never returnâ and in his
heart cf hearts there was s new doubt of
the wisdom of going to Wall street. But
it was too late to draw back.
Everybody In the drug trade seemed to
think that Gilmartin was on the high road
to fortune. Those old business acquaint
ances and former competitors Â»hom he
happened to meet In the street cars or in
theater lobbies always spoke to him as to
. millionaire-to-be, in what they imagined
v. as correct Well-street Jargon. Their ef
irts made him smile with a sense of su

dressing she can hardly become a belle,

The summer belle get* her results this
year by the very most trivial methods
and you would be surprisedâ were you to
make a critical study of her dressâ to see
how naturally and how simply she draw*
beauty out of her growns.
It Is the chief aim and ambition of the
summer girl to make the shoulders wide
and sloping and to narrow the size of her
hips. Anything that will do this Is eager
ly sought by her. for this Is the fashion
able figure of summer. \
Hips are fitted, until they cannot be
fitted any more closely, and the waist,
while not squeezed, Is drawn down and
flattened In the front to make it appear
smaller. The shoulder*, on the other
hand, are padded out, if the belle Is not
sufficiently broad, while the Ions slope of

HOP DRESSES FOR THE BELLE OF THE SEASON
THIS is to be a great year for the
belle of the season! In the simplest
I ways she can get the most charm
f Ing results and effects, and the dl
rect result is that the size of her
wardrobe Is doubled, while its beauty Is
increased many fold.
At Saratoga's first garden party there
appeared a tall, pretty girl in a white
organdie, to exquisitely trimmed that it
might have passed for a French creation
made by hands that never grow weary.
Its foundation, which was entirely of or
r&ndie. was trimmed with lace which was
net In around the skirt in a. band twelve
Inches wide. Above this wide band of in
sertion there came an application of Mex
ican wheels, as large as trade dollar?,
and these were buttonholed to the goods
Â«t Intervals of a few inches. Above the
Mexican wheels there came trianjr'ies of
lace, which were set upon the skirt in
F::ch a way as to outline a hip yoke.
The wclft was similarly treated and a
wlfie white ribbon 6tock. with a ribbon
belt, completed the very pretty picture.
But the particular point of the story is
this: Under thle dress of organdie the
pretty girl wore a plsk muslin corset
cover and und^r the organdie skirt ehe
wore a pink taffeta petticoat, the pink
showing through the organdie In a very
pretty way. One could Imagine that a
bright buttercup yellow would have
looked still prettier and that blue, by
evening light, would have been seraphic.
Of course, the pretty girl had. In her
eutamer truck, half a dozen slips, and, of
course, she worÂ» them under the same
pbwn. getting always a pretty and a dif
ferent effect.
â¢ The Newport belles have taken to em
broidery with a fervor that speaks omi
nously for their eyesight later on. On
en afternoon you can see them, seated
upon wide verandas or In cory corners
Â¦under the trees, hard at work embrolder
lr.grÂ«the fronts of shirt waist gowns. The
favorite color Is white and the favorite
linen, butcher's linen or any other of the
blue cotton wash stuffs. The pattern can
be perfectly plain, a well fitted gored
skirt and a cut on the shirt waist
pattern, with a little pouch over the belt
and with a pouch at the back of the
sleeves.
The very simplest styles, carried ou'. in
shirt waist putts, are as good as the elab
orate ones, for the gown depends more
upon its fit ajid its trimming than its ma
tcrraJ.
But. speaking of the "hop" gowns to be
worn by the belle of the season, rr.any
things are possible for her who is Indus
trious and full of taste. And no young
woman need despair, even though her
supply of gowns be limited to hair a
dozen for the e'ntire summer.
Evening Shirt Waist Suits.
One of the most becoming of hop
dresses is found in the tvenlng shirt
waist suit, which is made with two
waists, one high In the n^ek and the
other low. one very fancy and the other
rather plain. This gives the owner a
chance to make a change and provides
her with two dresses instead of one.
A Bar Harbor dancing g-irl appeared
In one of the loveliest evenin* dree*** of
the season. It* material was a fine white
linen and the skirt was plain, except for
a panel of narrow tucks down each side
of tht front. Then came the embroidery
scheme, which consisted of a little em
broidered vine running down each seam
and a large embroidered pattern upon the
front breadth.
The -waists, for ther* were two of
them, were made of linen and lace put
together in strips, with embroidery run
ning through all. One was cut rouniing
to give tht decollete effect. The other
was high, with a very clever lace stock
finishing the neck.
The belle of the season will want this
year a very wide embroidered collar, one
to be worn with any gown. And. to make
such a collar she will find it necessary
to cut out of brown paper a pattern that
will Just fit her neck and shoulders.
\
Bilk waists that fasten In the back are
prettily trimmed as to the front with silk
frogs that finish with ends and loops and
balls and queerly tied cotton and silk or
naments. These are very decorative and
If carried out In white are extremely dain
ty, giving a finishing touch to the waist.
And what a season It Is to be for the
woman who Is anxious fo transform her
wardrobe from time to tim* tato.some
thing new aAd attractive. And what a
season it Is for the summer! &Â«"â¢ who
either keeps a maid or Is handy with her
own fingers. â¢ . * Â«*
She can take her old shirt waists, a lit
tle shrunken, a little the wonÂ© for wear
and a great deal the wor** for sun an d
wind, and can cover the Jadod spots with
handsomely designed cord and tassel or
naments that hang as low as the waist
band and which dress up the gown uatU
it looks as though It wer* crisply new.
But for the most part the hanging trim
mings are shpwn.ln the handsome orna
ments that are used In place of buttons,
and you also see them upon the cuffs
and upon the collar,, wher* they Â«lvÂ« â¢
finishing touch to the grown. -

for they glv* that note of black wMA 1Â»

Another very noticeable feature of the
mmmer dress and of the sowns that
will be worn next fall is the style of
trimming which for lack of a better de
scription may be called the 1 hanging trim
ming. And of the hanging trimmings It
might almost be said that. there Is no end.
The most conspicuous are the crocheted
drops which hang from frogs, from passe
menteries and from decorative ornament*
of all kinds. Including metallic buttons.

PHOTOGRAPHING AGAINST THE
SON.
beginner frequently makes the
J mistake of photographing against
I the sunâ that is placing the lens in
I such a position as to receive, either
M directly or indirectly, the rays of
the sun while exposure Is being made.
This produces a cloudy effect and epolls
the picture, as shown In Illustration.
Protect the lens by having the sun at
the back of the camera, or on one side
of it while photographing, the latter po
sition being preferable. If it is absolute
ly necessary to face the sun. shade the
lens from above by your hand or hat. I

When replacing the glide- In the plate

for this is obvious. The plate-holder is
made with a. Email epring or door, as it
were, which closes quickly, when the
â¢slide is withdrawn, and fills the space al-
. lowed for It: thus you can readily see
that if you Insert the edge of the slide
first, in returning it to the holder, the
door or Faring is opened and light ad

It would not matter fo much were the

avoid possible error and insure the most
desirable results.

Â» OVEREXPOSED PLATES.
The correct time for exposing a negative
plate for both ir.door and outdoor work
has been one of the greatest stumbling
blocks to the amateur. Ecroes of times
have I been asked; "How do you deter
mine the proper time of exposure to mako
a successful picture?" '
A number of booklets have been issued
by makers of cameras and others, setting
forth the exact period required for the
exposure of plates under every imaginable
condition of light and shade, for both
landscapes and interiors; but these pam
phlets frequently prove very confusing.
The best instructor is your own Judg
ment combined with experience.
In my early days with the camera I
frequently experimented In exposing my
plates and- made a multitude of notes on
this Important subject. Now, however,
the correct exposure under the various
conditions of light is an instinctive
knowledge and I time my exposures much
as the expert "off hand shot" with rifle
or pistol fires at the mark without ap
pearing to take aim.
As his grasp of his gun decides the
#Â«adly aim of the trapper, so to the ex
perienced photographer the period of
time Is net a calculation, but 'an Instan
taneous conclusion acquired by long prac
tice. In my experience one of the surest
guides on this point has been the ground
glass of my camera. Regulate the dia
phragm or stop In your lens and when the
subject to be photographed Is reflected
on the ground glass note carefully the
degree of light and the time of exposure
and make a memorandum of the same for
future reference. Thas you will gradu
ally learn to compare and judge of the
respective times of exposure demanded by
the different degrees of light.
Suppose, for example, you make your
first experiment by placing In the holder
a plate that Is capable of very quick ex
posure. Tour lens Is of moderate speed,
the subject to be photographed Is a land
scape and the day i% clear and sunny.
Focus carefully with a magnifying glass,
place the stop No. 16 in the lens, note the
tight on the ground glass and remember
the degree of intensity. Give the plate
an exposure of one-half second.

11LE SUNDAY CALL.
Truly instantaneous photography Is one
of the most difficult branches of the art
of picture taking. It requires not only
a quick eye. but good as well as swift
Judgment, keen perception and a thor
ough knowledge of the details of photog
raphy. To these qualities should be add
ed coolness and deliberation enough to
snap the shutter at the proper moment
or rather fractional part of a second in
most cases. You should be neither too
slow nor too fast, or you will lose the
peculiar effect you desire to capture
An enthusiastic amateur attempted to
make an instantaneous photograph of a
locomotive and train of cars, which were
tearing along at the rate of a mile a
minute. He snapped the shutter, as ha
supposed, at the moment the train was
passing, but the plate, when developed,
revealed only a bare track, with no trace
of "the living engine and Its tail."
Do not stand too close to the scene or
object to be photographed. For Instance,
If you wish to make a picture of a train
of cars at full speed, take a position
fully a hundred and fifty feet distant,
and make your .exposure at an- oblique
angle, say forty-live to ninety degrees,
with the moving train coming towards
you. The distance scale of your camera
Â¦hould be set at 100 feet or the universal
focus. Contemplate the approaching
train, with calmness and when it appears

In every home there are plenty, of odds
and ends that always require* attention.
Wee things, to be sure, but i'f a button Is

and while It takes but a minute a number
of such trifles means much to the busy

It is almost pathetic at times to watch
the maneuverlngs of a husband and wife
trying to get a word in edgewise without
a third party listening. Not even In the
seclusion of their own room are they
free and they are denied the privilege of
a little walk because It would never do
to be so rude, and in their own home,
too. Far better, say I, to take to the tall
timber entirely and stay there until your

Of course It is not expected that a guest
shall be burdened with any amount of
labor. As a rule that la precisely ths
reason why people travel about from one
place to another. They want a rest and
a change and It most certainly is not a
rest to pitch In and do more work at a
friend's in a day than you would do to
a week at home. It is not the actual
task but the spirit that prompts the offer
ing that la appreciated.
One of the most unfortunats mistakes
that a guest can make is to |o to ths
theater without a latch key. It isn't
quite as bad if she thinks to ring up at
11 or so and ask that It be put in- the milk
pall or under the door mat. but to wait
until nearly 1 o'clock and then saunter In
perfectly unconcerned is about the limit.
It shows plainly what such a girl can be
thinking of, for selfishness is written in
capital letters all over her.
It is a very simple and a very easy
thing to forget a key. especially if you
are not in the habit of carrying one, but
that any one could so far forget herself
as to deliberately enjoy an after theater
supper when she knows full well that In
all probability some one Is waltln? for her
is beyond all understanding. It doesn't
seem to enter hÂ« head that it is not the
most enjoyable thing In the world to be
robbed of one's sleep or to be waked in
the midst of it either for that matter.
The first cousin of the night hawk is
the fiend w.fco sings and plays the piano
when all swsible people are In the land
of Nod, or rather inwardly swearing and
tearing their hair because thev are not
there. The business man with bis count
less worries needs his rest and it is noth
ing more or less than a beastly shame for
him to be deprived of it nlgbt after night
and in such a heartless way.
Tact will almost carry you around the
globe but it never should be exercised to
such an extent as when you are one of
a small family. The very narrowness of
your confinement calls for every bit of
adroitness and knack that yoa possess.
If, however you are a clever and a long
headed girl you can make yourself so dear
to your visiting list that the entire family.
Including babies and all. will be impa
tiently waiting at the depot to receive you
with open arms.
No matter how good a friend yiu inky fee
there are bound to be annoyances and it
is best to keep them secret. Hie your
self off into the privacy of your boudoir
once in a while on the plea of writing
letters, for certainly you must tell your
folks what a rattling good time you are
having, and select the opportunity to do |
it when the entire family has assembled
for a few minutes. Rest assured If they
want you they will have no hesitancy
about calling, for they: are quite as well
aware of the fact that the majority of
If it chances to be you the memory is
quickened and the hands seem infinitely
more willing.
The careless girl never stops to think.
As a rule she Is having such % joyous
time that her mind is brim full of gayety.
Don't be that girl. If you pick up a
banjo and knock over a basket of pic
tures at one and the same time, think
that your hostess may. come into the room
to have a little chat and that the very
first thing she will do wlllbe to carefully
gather the pictures and right the basket.
Don't wait until ehe is down on her knees
and then contritely say, "I meant to do It
in a minute." Oh. those minutes cause so
much trouble. Now and then take time
by the forelock and surprise yourself and
everybody else by using them at an apro
pos time
This thoughtless girl, for carelessness
and thoughtlessness 'are one and- tho
same thing, never dreams that even in
the best regulated families there are mo
ments when they would like to be alone.
That settled matters. The offenders
were assembled In a body and duly given
warning that all lost articles would
promptly be relegated to a barrel in the
storehouse. For the next few days every
time any one wanted to dress somebody
was delegated to pay their respects head
first to that catch-all, and it was surpris
ing how soon they gathered their wits
about them and made the acquaintance of
the hat boxes, closets and drawers. It
makes a decided difference, you know,
who cares for your belongings.
The careless visitor Is a most awful
nuisance to have about for any length of
time. When ehe comes in her hat drops
in one spot, her coat on the couch and
her gloves and parcels just where they
happen to light first. Kor an hour she
will He and diligently read the latent
magazine, with her belongings scattered
to the four winds, regard.ess of the fact
that there are no other hats lying around
here, there and everywhere, but are put
where they belong.
The best cure for such a girl Is the bar
rel system. I know of one woman who
had four lively girls spending several
weeks at her summer villa and who never
considered her home or her feelings In
the slightest. When the bell rang they
would rush about, make sundry snatches
and literally fall over each other in their
wild haste to escape without being
caught.
At first this animated scramble was
considered in the light of a good Joke,
but when it occurred every day and sev
eral times a day it lost its ginger and was
tpeedlly reduced to the ranks of the com
monplace. Finally the climax was reach
ed when the most correct and dignified
lady in the land was properly scandalized
by sitting down on a corset and having
a slipper that had been lost in the chase
stare her in the face all during her call.
All this in the drawing-room. /
the kitchen queen, and. incidentally, make
matters easier and mure agreeable for the
mistress.
Moralâ Be on time to all your meals.
Make it a rule, and never deviate from it
1n the slightest. Because your hostess
carries you it dainty tray and insists that
It is no trouble, don't take her at her
word and Impose on good nature. She
means partly what she says, but trans
lated in a cold-blooded fashion It signifies
it is not half as much trouble to carry
you a tray as it is to keep the kitchen
and breakfast room in disorder half the
morning. For this is exactly wliat a 10
o'clock tray moans. Many a hostess has
moraine after morning prepared a tempt
ing coffee and delivered it In person to
keep on the right Fide of a good maid.
And rpraking of maids reminds me.

If the curtain could be rung down he,re,
leaving her happy ever after, romance
would fall stale and profitless, but, unfor
tunately, the happiness or misery of life
follows, and the wedding day casts no
prophecies, but smiles through sunshine
or blinks through rainy tears Just as if
human hearts did not ache or break In
their rambling through the wilderness of
matrimony. And when a girl falls In love
all the common sense that has previously
characterised her is negatived, and- there
are precious few who love wisely and well
or love well and wisely.
The nature and disposition of the girl
decides whether the object of her affec
tion be worthy and wisely chosen, and.
la fascinated by the welcome the world
extends to a pretty girl whose parents
have the wealth to invite it to share its
hospitality. She Judges every one from
the standard of her own pure self and life
flows on to the measured harmony of ona
sweet, glad song.
Then comes her formal entrance Into so
ciety, when the romance fairly bubbles
over and she is radiantly happy. A round
of pleasure follows when she is sought by
every one. Her accomplishments,- her
personality, and, above all. her magnet
ism, are her stock in trade, which will
bring her either happiness or misery.
She meets men galore at dances, recep
tions, and everywhere finds herself sur
rounded by a swarm and admiration is
rampant.
Then she falls In love.
f'he seeming paradox needs little illus
tration, as there are few of us who can
not recall the lives of those who having
met sudden misfortune have risen supe
rior to the madness of despair or the tur
bulence of grief-developing qualities,
amazing alike to both friends and mem
bers of their own families, who never
guessed the slumbering possibilities.
The romance of a girl's life is a some
thing that weaves an aureole or traces
the scars of destiny, never to be effaced.
If 6he has been happy the romance nas
been her world; if she has been mlser
eblc. then perhaps It will better enable
her to bear the after scourglngs of fate.
A girl leaves the schoolroom with her
brain filled with the loveliest o! ideals.
Ebe has imbibed a certain flavor of ro
mance that permeates the atmosphere
about her. Her own life has been so pure
and eweet that she knows nothing else.
This is particularly true of girls bred in
convents, who have not the faintest Idea
of anything practical and whom it takes
years of experience to imbue with the
znoet ordinary tenets of worldly wisdom.
A girl reared in a boarding-school, of
course, knows less of life than one who
has always been at home. I do not mean
the fashionable boarding-school, where
young ladies entertain, give muslcales and
teas, inviting their brothers and the other
girls' brothers, but tne old-fashioned,
straight-laced boarding-school, where the
the lemon of a cocktail, imparts its
flavor, and at the same time it Is hard to
tell whether it were better to have loved
and lost than never to have lost at all,
or never to have loved or lost, or lost and
loved, or never to have loved at all; but
any way you put it it's a fool's paradise
while it lasts It Is Just about as exuber
antly happy and Intoxicating a state as
poor humanity will ever burglarize dur
ing its mortal sojourns.
It xnay be regretted later on with the
most poignant regret, but the experience
may be the one necessity rounding the
character, which otherwise would never
have known its power.
It is the griefs and sorrows of life that
meld character into noblest shapes and
possibilities. Happiness makes one leth
argicânumbing the forces of brain and
brawnâ but let misfortune come, and the
inertia Is startled into wondrous activity.
IF life were all romance the worlA
would be again deluged and the flood
would be of â happiness.
It is the romance of life that, like
hide rrom the world evidence of her sor
row, and the only refuge of despairâ the
pawn shop â seems her only friend.
She takes .her trinkets â old presents.per
haps from loved ones long ago passedâ
"shadows under the flowers, under -tha
snow." or treasured souvenirs of girlish
escapades, and, bravely forcing back her
tears, she selects some trifle, the part
ing from which nearly breaks her heart,
and wends her way. Even to enter- tha
place seems desecration and she glances
furtively on either side, fearing to be Been
by some friend of her girlhood. The hu
miliation is bitter enough, but the bitter
disappointment adds to her despair when

treasures possess In the cold-blooded eyes

SAL SWINDLES. A*JD HER SJSTER AND DAUGHTER WHOM THE
MAGISTRATE DISMISSED FROM CUSTODY.'
!-,^**& ACRAMENTO, Ang. 8.â A day
' ft^_ which promised much In con
â¢ nec.tlon with the pursuit *o"
, *^ Frank - Miller and Ray Fahey.
two of the Folsom prison es
*' . . capes, has passed without im
portant developments. City and county
peace officers . who had confidently ex
pected that one or both of the notorious
outlaws would, be captured by nightfall
were forced to admit at midnight that for
the time, at least, they were baffled.
From the time Fahey and Miller escaped
from the railroad yards last night, after
Detective Max P. Fisher had shot five
times at the former, large forces of
armed men have been beating the brush
along the American River, in which the
hunted men undoubtedly sought refuge,
but without result.
The officers believe^ that Fahey and pos
sibly Miller are still In the brush north
of the city, and that they have been so
harried by the posses that they have had
no chance to escape from the brush, but
have been compelled to remain In close
hiding. The locality in which Fahey and
his companion arc supposed to be hiding
embraces a considerable area and is cov
ered by a dense growth of .underbrush
and vines, .which form a network so thick
as to be almost impenetrable.
OPENS FIRE ON OFFICERS.
The .belief that Fahey. at least, is in
this natural - hiding place Is stsengthened
by'the fact that at 4 o'clock this morning
a man about the < height and proportions
of the notorious ' highwayman engaged
Special Officers H. J. Winters and Charles
Williams In a running fight at the tres
tle which forms the approach to the rail
road bridge over the American ' River,
northeast of the city. The combat was
witnessed by" a flagman employed by the
railroad /company from his tower on thÂ»
trestle not 100 yards away.
A man emerged . from the brush and
started in the ; direction of Williams and
Winters. The latter . called Â¦ upon ' him to
halt, and thinking possibly the man might
be 'one of the man . hunters. Winters an
nounced who he was. Immediately thÂ«
stranger opened fire with a revolver,
emptying his weapon. Winters and Wil
liams' returned the -flre and the man re
tieated to the brush. The Sheriff's of
fice and police station were notified and a
number of men were, sent out, but no
trace of Â¦ the man who commenced the
shooting could be found.
Fox hounds 'were sent Into' the brush
this afternoon, followed by a dozen men.
in the hope of rounding up all the tramps
and hobos who frequent the place. Tha
brush, however, was too thick and the
day too hot to work the dogs successfully,
and at dark. the majority of the men who
had .been acting under Sheriff David
Reese returned, to. the city. Fresh pick
ets were placed on duty so as to surround
the bnish from the American River bridge
to the Sacramento River, to prevent any
body leaving the beleaguered section, and
at daylight another search of the brust
will be made.
LOSE TRAIL OF HOWARD.
Sheriff Reese. and. Constable M. Judge
returned from Tolo County at an early
hour -this morning, having temporarily
abandoned the hunt for Howard in that
county. At one time they were close upon
the fugitive's trail, they claim, but It gave
out, leaving them baffled and confused.
I At 1 , no time . since Saturday last have
,the ' convicts been - in grave " danger. ' Ever
on â the : alert, r the .fugitives . have avoided
and .misled- their- pursuers," but to-night
the ' hunted men are at a disadvantage.
They are hastening. through a country un- :
known to' them In an endeavor to* find a
route to possible freedom. ' Twenty-four
joir ; forty-eight hours will probably, tell the
measure of . their success ; or '* failure ; In
/Sheriff Bosquit Is confident that . the
posse* will get satisfactory results. It was
reported later that the outlaws ate break
fast at Whittle's ranch, In the same
neighborhood.
, Rumors of. every kind are as prevalent
as T ever.'. It is believed, however, that the
much wanted ; fugitives are In- the hill
'country and ] proceeding leisurely toward
the summit. : : The outlaws take to the
.water frequently that they may not be
followed by. the hounds. Tht fnclals sur
mise that the escapes are going slowly
lnTorder to let. the whole matter become
quW. .None'of the pursued felons are
thought to .know the topography of east
ern El Dorado County, and must follow
the road ,' ridge ' or river. The road , is, of
course, impracticable,' and the river much
easier and better than the" ridge.- If the
hunted men veer to the north they will
get; Into tnV granite country, where the
brush is- only -breast high. Their capture
there would be' an easy matter. The coun
try "^due" east 'of Â¦ Dogtowh Is rough and
practically devoid of human . habitation.

. , cording to reports which have
reached the Sheriff's office In this city.
Nothing. was said in either report about
the outlaws leaving a $5 gold piece to pay
for their meal, so the monotony is broken.
The first news came by way of Grizzly
Flat and was to the effect that five heav

ited John Richardson, a sheepherder for
Lewis' Meiss,' and 'demanded breakfast.
They were. supplied with food, and after
eating heartily . started due east up the

southeast of Grizzly Flat. Sheriff Bos

posse is composed of Gilbert Cook, Robert

Nearly ICO persons received fractures of
the limbs, lacerations of the head, broken

but their condition is not serious.
CURIOSITY CAUSES DEATHS.
Tvro games were scheduler! between
Boston and Philadelphia and the attrac
tion drew more than 10,000 persons to the
ball park. The accident occurred at 5:40
o'clock, while the Boston team was at
bat in the last half of the fourth inning
cf the second game, and was indirectly
due to a quarrel between two drunken
men In the street. The National League
stands are built of eteel and brick, the
brick wall extending entirely around the
grounds. At the top of the left field seats
and extending from the grand stand to
thÂ«B bleachers there was a walk about
three feet wide which overhung the street.
It was this walk that gave way undtr
the heavy weipht.
Men who were standing on the walk
were attracted by the disturbance in the
etreet. They leaned over the side of the
railing to see what was the trouble and
.drew the attention of the other spectators
fated on the top rows of the bleachers,
jrfen occurred what is ?ecn almost every
day at a ball game â a rush to see what
tne other spectators were looking at. The
bleacher walk became overcrowded and
without a moment's warning 200 feet of it
fell to the sidewalk, thirty feet below,
carrying all who were on it.
PANIC ON THE GROUNDS.
There were probably 3000 persons sitting
on the left-field bleachers and the roar
made by the falling timbers created a
panic. Instantly the spectators arose en
masse and made a rush down the stand
and Into the playing field. Men and boys
diabed over one another In tneir effort
to escape from the grounds. Notwith
standing what had occurred, the ball
' players and others tried to stop the mad
'rush, but they were swept aside In their
unsuccessful efforts and several persons
â¢were badly hurt In the crush.
Outside the grounds the scene was one
of horror. For an entire block on Fif
teenth street, from Huntlngton street to
Lchigh avenge, men and boys were lying,
Â¦writhing In agony. Some were buried
under the wreckage, others were lying In
the gutters and dozens were stretched
out in Fifteenth street on the cartracks.
Some were unconscious, others were roll-
Ing over. suffering great pain, and others
attempted to get up and walk, only to
fall again. . v
The 10,000 persons in the grounds left the
place and crowded about the Injured, of
whom there were more than a. hundred.
Indescribable confusion reigned for a time
because of the great crowd.
CARING FOR THE INJURED.
A general ambulance call was sent out.
AJ1 r houses In the vicinity were thrown
open to the victims. One of the largest
car barns in the city Is situated across
the street from the ball park, and one
wrecking car was quickly filled with neip
less men and rushed to St. Joseph's Hos
pital, more than two miles away. Other
victims were placed In wagons of all de-^
scriptlons belonging to the street car
company and taken to hospitals. Nearly
every Injured person taken away .was
covered by blood and the street looked
like a field of carnage. Police ambulances
and patrol -wagons arrived in time to take
The Interrogation of Mjadame Humbert
furnished the chief incident of the day,
but failed to develop any surprises or
bring-out the whereabouts of the mys
terious Crawford brothers, her statement
consisting mainly of vague declarations
of her honesty. As the Judge read ex
tracts from :the dossier, reviewing" her
family antecedents, sho waved , . Malt re
Labori aside, and,' rising with notes In her'
hand, Insisted on directing her own case.'
Judge Bonnet inquired about her eccen
tric father, who v assumed â¢ the title-, of

HOWARD GETS
OUT OF REACH
OF PURSUERS
PL.TMOUTH, Aug. 8.â Sheriff Nor
man and his men are still encamp
ed near Ham Station along the
middle fork- of the Cos'umnes Riv
er. They will move to the northward
shortly in accordance with instructions
sent to the leader of the posse by a
mounted courier from Sheriff Bosquit of
El Dorado County. Sheriff Norman has
been convinced all along that the con
victs are progressing slowly up the river
bed parallel with the ridge road leading
to the summit. He had come to the con
clusion that the outlaw^ advance only one
or two miles daily In order that excite
ment may die out. Ills men are quar
tered In a camp on the ridge road and
guard the covered approaches along the
river day. and -night. ThÂ« other Sheriffs
tried the pursuit plan, but the Amador
peace officer determined to attempt to
ambush the quarry. So he set traps and
planned to have the convicts walk Into
them. Instead of coming to meet Norman
the convicts turned northward toward the
rough country.
Previous to the arrival of Sheriff Bos
quit's messenger, Norman decided to
wait until he was pure the quarry had es
caped and then head the felon3 off aTgalnon
the way to the summit. He has a month's
supplies and provisions with him. how
ever, and will keep in touch with the sit
uation and try to land his game as long
as there appears any chance of success.
He sent for reinforcements last night and
two or three men left Plymouth and
Jackson to-day to assist him.
Dr. Norman, a brother of thÂ© Sheriff,
has become excited over the hunt and
left to-night on horseback to join the
posse. The people at Wiley s Station
thought Thursday night that the guards
on the river had seen the convicts, as
several rifle shots were heard In that di
rection. It was discovered subsequently
that one of the man hunters had taken
a little diversion by shooting at a bear.
The animal was wounded, but escaped.
Now that the outlaws have swerved
from their course Norman will co-operate
with Bosquit and the professional trail
ers. The Amador County Sheriff, how
ever, will not be persuaded from his view
that the outlaws ore trying to get to the
country in the vicinity of West Point,
where one of the hunted felons is thought
to have friends. Little can be done by
any of the pursuers until the convicts are
located. A deluge of false rumors makes
the way dark and progress extremely
slow.
ALL IS READY
FOR CORONATION
Pope Forbids Acclama
tion at Vatican or
Basilica.
ROME, Aug. 8.â By special permission
a representative of the press was allowed
to enter St. Peter's to-night to observe
the preparations for the coronation to
morrow. In the center aisle a wide space
has been fenced off for the passage of
tfle cortege. The chapels have been richly
decorated with red damask fringed with
gold. The Papal throne rises majestic
ally at the farther end of the great build
ing, being a bewildering mixture of gold,
red and silver and appearing altogether
too gorgeous to be sat in. On the right a
space has been reserved for the diplo
matic body, the Knights of Malta, and
special representatives and envoys; on the
left another space has- been reserved for
the Roman aristocracy.
The portico of St. Peter's has been
closed by immense curtains to prevent
any one from looking in as the Pope
passes, which would seem to confirm the
statement that Pope Plus X will not bless
the people from .an outside balcony as
was half expected. Â¦.Â¦Â¦.,
The new Pope has been upsetting all
customs at the Vatican. 'When courtiers
thought to-day" to give him pleasure by
saying that he would have, a tremendous
reception at St. Peter's on Sunday, the
Pope was much * displeased and absolute
ly forbade anything of the kind, saying
that he would not have it. He called his
major domo, who thereupon issued the
following proclamation, which was dis
tributed as widely as possible:
"It Is the warm desire of his Holiness
to have no acclamation at the Vatican or
Basilica, and that the most devout and
most religious silence be maintained."
Another innovation at the Vatican Is the
Pope's refusal to permit everybody to be
sent away when he appears. A gendarme
had ordered away some masons who were
working about the grounds because the
Pope was about to come forth. The Pope
himself witnessed this action and had the
gendarme severely reprimanded. The
masons were recalled and the Pope spoke*
to each of them, laying his hand on their
he"ads and giving them his blessing, to
their immense delight The Pope also in
sists on continuing his habit of accom
panying all persons whom he has received
to the door, no matter how humble. Every
diplomatic measure has been adopted ' to
have him abandon this custom, but with
out avail. He declares his wish so to do,
and he will. ; V
The outcry regarding the distribution of
the tickets for the coronation ceremonies
has assumed vast proportions. Many dis
tinguished Catholics, especially foreigners
who have arrived \ in Rome for the pur
pose of being present at the ceremonies,
have been unable to obtain tickets, while
speculators are selling them on the
streets. At the French embassy accred
ited to the Vatican great indignation pre
vails, and a communication has been ad
dressed to the press Informing the French
colony that, it will be impossible to pro
vide tickets, as only thirty have been re
ceived at the embassy. The Government
has ordered 1000 troops to occupy the
plaza in front of St. Peter's at 4 O'clock
Sunday morning.
The departure from Rome of Cardinals
langenitux and Lecot without waiting for
the coronation Is much commented upon,
as the French Cardinals had refused un
til the last moment to vote for Sarto.

a matter of time "now until the chase is

The town is very quiet now that the
scene of action is drifting away, and a
general feeling of relief is felt.
Convicts Woods, Theron, Eldredf e, Mur

RANCHERS ARE REJOICING.
The women and children of El Dorado
County in the outlying districts are over
joyed that tho colored convict, Seavis, Is
captured. Ever since the break at the
penitentiary the people of , the county
have been in dire dread that the Mack
brute would pay a visit to do murder. He
has been pictured everywhere as a fiend
Incarnate and his showing of the yellow
streak at Auburn was a great surprise.
The stage driver from Placer County
towns arrived in the city to-day with the
report that at every riouse along the
road men, women and children rushed out
to meet him to know if it was really true
that Seavis was once more in the hands
of the law and -safe behind prison bars.
The white outlaws are not feared so much
by reason of the succession of stories of
their courteous behavior at all the- places
where they have called. But Seavis was
declared to be literally hungering to slay.
It was said everywhere that he had want
ed to kill every man whom the escapes
met on the strength of the trite saying
that "Dead men tell no tales."
The capture of the negro marks an
epooh(In the history of thÂ« chase. He
was reported to be In a dozen locations
every day and was "in reality the main

of the people In general. Alarm has

and the excitement is ebbing.
i The newspapers don't reach the dwell
ings of many of El Dorado County's in
habitants until three or "four days after
they are published. Reports of the cap
ture or killing of convicts #Lre so common
that the ranchers and their families do
not know Just what to believe. All along
the roads, therefore, people are crying
for the papers with the news of tho re
capture of the black desperado.
The greater part of {he people in the In
terior saw the papers to-day and went to
bed to sleep more easily than at any time
since the news of the prison break was
first circulated.
and sent them on the right way.' The
Pope soon put them at ease, saying:
"Come here and sit next to me."
From that moment Pius X spoke in the
Venetian dialect. Ho inquired after va
rious people In thÂ© village, recalling with
evident satisfaction his personal inter
course with them, saying:
"Throughout my career and even now
I remember with joy and emotion my
youthful days among you. which were
also my happiest."
The. Mayor and the villagers tried to ex
press their gratification at the great hon
or accruing to their small village, from
Sarto's election, and also what a great
triumph* it was for him personally. The
Pontiff answered:
"I cannot yet realize it. On coming to
Rome I was so sure of peacefully return
ing to my patriarchate at Venice that I

there are many which might be the envy
of any museum. A complete set of china
dishes which were a wedding present to
Mrs. Stanford's mother and a very val
uable collection of Sevres from the eight
eenth century are the most beautiful of
the large amount of porcelain ware 'that
has arrived, and sets of, old silverware
and Venetian glass that have been in the
family mansion here for many years are
of especial Interest. There is one room in
the museum in which everything relating
to the Stanford family has been placed,
and a great part of this recent gift is
being put there. Among the new articles
to be exhibited there ia the last thing
made by Mrs. Julia D. Grant, the wife
of General Grant. It Is a little woolen
carpet, which she knit as a present to
Mrs. Stanford, and with it is the last let
ter she wrote. Also four ancient looking
books and several manuscripts containing
sermons and poems by Mrs. Stanford's
great-grandfather, the Rev. James Fenn,
who in his day was one of the greatest
American ministers. Curator Peterson
put in place to-day in this room several
apostolic spoons which were beaten out
of solid silver by monks in a European
monastery during the eighteenth cen
tury. Their handles have been delicately
cast by hand.
To the modern Oriental exhibits Mrs.
Stanford has presented some of the most
beautiful and costly Egyptian and Turk
ish embroideries, which she bought in
Constantinople and Cairo, and to the large
Japanese collection she has added elab
orate embroidery, some rar*e examples of
cloisonne ware and a very expensive Jap
anese kimono, made especially for her.
It Is of delicately tinted blue silk, richly
embroidered with long clinging wistaria
blossoms, and is said to be one of the
handsomest specimens of modern Japan
ese handicraft. Here also were placed
to-day two albums of Japanese views
with exquisite ivory and pearl ornaments
inlaid by hand on the covers, and num
eious other articles.
Besides the relics that have been men
tioned there are many others of various
descriptions in this recent addition, all
of which are being placed in their proper
rooms in the museum. Among the books
received by far the most valuable is a
complete set of nine immense volumes of
the great work entitled "The Antiquities
of Mexico," which was published more
than a quarter of a century ago. It was
compiled by Monsieur Dupalx with great
labor and expense for Lord Kingsborough
and there are very few sets extant. It Is
full of valuable facsimile engravings of
ancient Mexican works of art.

STOCKTON, Aug. 8.â Joseph Belonl, an
Italian boy, 9 years of age, was drowned
in Mormon Channel last evening under
peculiar circumstances. It appears that a
number of boys went bathing: in the chan
nel at the foot of Main street, near the
new Southern Pacific bridge. Belonl could
not swim, but it Is claimed two young
colored boys named Hart, half-brothers
of Benny Hart, the pugilist, threw him
into the water in order to make him
swim. The boy was drowned in sight of
his companions, and two 0/ the other boys'
reported the fact to* their mother. She
paid little attention to what was told her,
thinking it was only boyish talk. When
her husband returned she mentioned the
fact to him and he questioned the boys,
after which the stepmother of the
drowned boy was notified. It was not,
known to a certainty by the officers' that
the boy was drowned until his body was
found in the channel. this morning.
The police are investigating the case.
The Hart boys were taken to the police
office, but those who claimed to have
seen two colored boys throw the deceased
into the water. could not identify them.

Case and May Make
Arrests.

DURING the past week and a half we have
given school buttons to over one-fourth
of the school childrcrN in San Francisco.
They were all pleased with the buttons and #
appreciated our enterprise.
. We want every boy in San Francisco to
get acquainted with our store for we believe he
has some say as to where his clothes are
purchased. This is why we give out the but-
tons. Of course we give the buttons to the
girls too.
We have had a great many calls for pri-
vate school buttons, so desire to state that it
was hardly possible for us to secure the school
name and number of pupils in all the private
schools. Rather than please some and dis-
appoint others we confined the buttons exclu-
sively to the public schools, even omitting the
normal and training schools.
In case we secure the desired information
we hope to issue more buttons for all the pri-
vate schools. Announcement will be made at
the time.
In the meantime we arc ready to supply
all children with buttons, for the Primary,
Grammar, Evening or Public High Schools.

the Bubject, so that to-day's more formidable
increase intensified tho obscurity. Â¦ It Is likely
that the support to the market which was ac
corded on Thursday involved a loosening of
the rmrsestrlnEs of the banks for the purpose
of checking the demoralization then threaten
ing.. \t is a'so now agreed that much of the
recent heavy liquidation in Wall street haa been
for repayment to bunks ouUlde of Wall street
under the trust companies, whose showing does
not figure fn the bank statement. The result
ls to throw demands for renewals upon the
associated banks. .Loans made at the Stock
Exchange on Friday â¢ carried over until Mon
day, eo that to-day's, demand was not due to
actual further calling of loans, but to appre.
henslon of next week's proceeding. . ,

FLOODS AGAIN
SWEEP ISLANDS
Things had got to the etago where the rapid
shrinkage of prices had driven out buyers from
the. market, while. the holders of collateral for
loans, seeing the instability of values, were
eager to convert their : security ; into ready
money. The market was unfit to absorb this
selling, which . aggravated the weakness and
reacted again by further shrinkage of collat
eral. These are the conditions of nanic, -and
Itis an axiom of finance that the only .treat
ment for checking a.' panic, is the free exten-'
sion of credits to afford an opportunity for men
to arrange affairs. A sudden ! contraction of
final dealing's again and the closing was very
weak and furiously active.
Prices of stocks have made a headlong
downward plunge this week through the pre
vious low records for the year, thus arousing
renewed fears over the shrinkage of collateral
in loans und prompting its selling out at what
prices It would bring. The resulting demor
alization was arrested somewhat abruptly on
Thursday, by what cause was not very clear.
There was evidence that some of the very
large buying on that day was for account of
large banks and Individual capitalists of large
resources, and whose leadershiu In any move
ment in the Mock market is of great senti
mental Influence.- It was observed also that
there was less pressure of liquidation of the
urgent kind, which Indicated the unloading of
collateral forced by the recall of loans which
borrowers wore unable to respond to. â¢ The
effect of these developments was a swift re
vulsion of sentiment in the market, leading
to a quick assumption that a coalition had
been formed among the great banks and capi
talists to coma to the rescue of the market by
taking freely of offers and by lending of money
and cessation of the . selling out of collateral
which had demoralized the market and de
stroyed Its power of absorption. This was the
first indication ln a long- time of any other
purpose en the part of the dominant financial
powers than to let the liquidation take its
course and the market tako care of itself. Th<>
prolonged absence of Influential buying in the
market has been the cause of great uneasiness
in itself on account of . the ', Inferences drawn
that the great capitalists were themselves
largely concerned in the need for funds owing
to unwieldy commitments in great promotions
This Inference has been varied by assump
tions that hostility between groups of capital
ists has been involved in the fall of prices
and that projects of absorption of the proper
ties attacked lay behind the persistent forcing
down of prices. It was evident that the dis
orderly fall of prices was getting beyond con
trol and threatening widespread disaster and
the recovery brought great relief from a severe
strain. .

credits Involves the certain occurrence pf wide
spread bankruptcy. The condition of the stock
market ' of the early part of the w.eek had
reached almost the opposite pole of the period
of the creat bull market. Then ' there were
imn-tk'Rlly no sellers of stocks at any prices
and the continuance of demand without a bal
ancing supply left no limit to' the possible
rib | in prices without regard to Investment re
tiirns.
By the Â¦ middle of this week there seemed
to be a paralysis of the demand for stocks
at any stage of the decline, notwithstanding
the steady advance in the rate of return on
stocks of the highest grade which was brought
about by the. decline. So long as buying was
withheld' and' the attempts to liquidate con*
tlnued there would be no limit to the decline
â¢without regard to the | intrinsic value of se
curities. Th<t exertion of main strength Is
necessary to check such a course of affairs,
and that seems'to be what was done on Thurs
day.
A considerable short interest assisted the
recovery of- the .market after the declining
tendency was once- overcome and hopes are
entertained that support will be forthcoming
for any new weakness. The question of the
end of the liquidation remains an open one.
The movement of prices has had little to. do
with the - news of. the week.- Tho sustained
level of bank loans In face of the enormous
liquidation already achieved is a matter of
troubled conjecture and attempts to explain
it have ranged over a wide field without reliev
ing the depressing Influence of the fact. The
questipn of whether the long shrinkage in
prices of securities and the resulting contrac
tion of, credits; will, react on the general'busi
ness situation ' has changed Into the question
of how far the reactionary influence will ex
tend. Difficulties in financing new projects
jn the industrial field, . especially, in the Iron
and steel , trade, because of the contraction of
credits' growing out pf the . money and stock
market situation, are admitted.' and there is a
feeling of anxiety/ ove^r the possibility of "a
coming business and industrial reaction. The
critical season for the croos is < also an un-
Bettllns factor, which will not be entirely re
moved until the crops are definitely made

Commissioner Lererle has received .'let
ters objecting to the use of the word
"spit," in the ordinances, and advising
the word "expectorate." When President
Roosevelt was Police Commissioner he
strenuously urged the use of "spit," and
called "expectorate" "a vile word." One
must side with the President in this mat
ter, in a general way, although it might
be permissible to add that etymologically
epeaking "sputum" and "expectoration"
may designate two different excreta. The
Bputum (allied to spatter may be from
the chest or may not be, although this
is not the question in mind when framing
the ordinances. The sanitarium does not
aim at a differentiation. People who "ex
pectorate" will probably "perspire" In
stead of "sweat." That some officials do
iind a distinction where others do not ls
shown by the fact that in an Eastern
city the following notice is displayed in
the street cars: "Passengers must not ex
pectorate nor spit on the floor of this
car." /'Expectorate" is,. morbid alike in
a medical, a phllologic and a social sense,
but no charge can be made by philology
against Vspit." According to the editor
of Literary Notes of the British Medical
Journal t,he only advantage "expectorate"
can claim is that It once Incited a good
pun: "Some one speaking to a lady of a
friend , of whom it might have been said
tlrat ho" had no manners and his customs
were lycastly, gave an example j that he
would not hesitate to expectorate ln her
presence. She at once replied, 'Then he

PITTSBURG, Kans.,' - Augr. 8.â Aboufl
half past 1 o'clock thia morning a tornado
passed .through the thickly* populated
mining district north and east of Pitts
burg, destroying hundreds of houses,
mine tipples" and buildings of every de-
Bcriptlon, leveling to a mass of wreck
age a large portion of every camp be
tween tho Devlin-Miller shaft north of
Frontenao and the- Morgan shaft on tha
State line, and converting into ruin a strip
of thickly populated territory eight" miles
long and a couple of miles wide and leav
ing death and desolation ln its wake. At
least two persons were killed and fully
6ixty injured in the storm and perhaps
many others were injured whose names
have not been procured.
The killed: ;
. MICHAEL. MULLEN, at Nelson.
MRS. ANTONE SARTO, at Camp 17.
The most seriously Injured are: Mrs.
William Holllday, Morgan Camp, ribs
broken, back Injured, will die; William
Short, Morgan Camp, badly injured in
ternally, may die; son of George Weaton,
colored, of Yale, back. broken, may die;
Carl Johnson, colored, of Nelson, arm
broken and 6kull fractured, may die;
John Davidson, west of Camp 17, ribs bro
ken', may die; Italian miner at Devlin-
Miller camp, name unknown, injured in
ternally, will prqbably die.
The storm swept across the country
from the northwest and whirled in a
southeasterly direction, doing great dam
age ln all of the mining camps, which are
thickly clustered- in that section of the
country. The destruction appeared to
commence at* the Devlin-Miller camp,
known as Mlllerton and from there
southeast through camps 17 and 31, Nel
son, Midway, Yale, Cornell, Lttchfleld and
the other camps, nearly totally destroy
ing some of them and doing terrible dam
age to all. The property loss will not be
great, for most of the homes destroyed
were the humble houses occupied by the
miners and in most cases belonged to the
coal companies. t

ACmlral Sanda kept his squadron to
gether all the time and in afcout the
Fame order. A quarter of a mile In ad
Â¦Â»-ance was one of the torpedo-boat de
stroyers, acting as advance guard. Early
Kriday eight a thick fog rolled la from
the sea and Admiral Sands ordered the
fleet to race at full speed for Winter
Harbor, the easterly entrance of French
r:ans Bay. It was the Intention of Ad
miral Sands to enter Winter Harbor, and
If discovered to run into Bar Harbor,
or possibly keep along the coast and ef
fect an entrance somewhere else, but the
OljTcpia prevented this.
The -wireless message of the Oiympia
Fummoned the Kearsarge and the other
reserve battleships In time to brinj? the
Â«^neray Into ection when he was still six
miles from his proposed anchorage. In
this search problem the value of the
â¢wireless telegraph In the navy has been
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
naval officers. Under ordinary conditions
It would have been several hours before
1he Olyicpla could have communicated
her discovery cf the enemy to any other
Khlps cf the squadron, even though she
rould have made a run for it. which the
rules prohibited. But by aid of wire
less service not only was ehe able to
inform the admiral of the approach of
the enemy, but Admiral Barker's flag
ship, the Kearsarge. transmitted the mes
sage sent by the Oiympia from ship to
Bhlp'elong the whole length of the coast
from Mount Desert Rock to Cape Ann.
fo that -to a short time all of the de
fending sauadron was informed of the
fact that the enemy was In sight and
reinforcements to Admiral Barker were
coming from miles along the coast
FU5JJ OP ATTACK.
Admiral Sands sailed from Bar Har
bor Monday. He ran 300 miles south of
Nova ScoUa. and on Wednesday turned
tack toward the coast. Fcr two days
ihe fleet sailed at half ppeed. so that
It would not reach the coast of Maine
too soon.
Admiral Sands' flagship, the Texas.
made no response with her guns. In
fiead a Trhlte flag \raa run up on tha
"^oxas. Then followed an Interesting ln
â¢Tchange of signals and the squadron
headed for Bar Harbor.
Tt was about 4:30 o'clock when the
Olyrcpla's wireless message was received
on the Kearsarge. General quarters were
sounded and In a remarkably short time
'he Kearsarge was under way. followed
*.n fern by the Alabama and Illinois. A
-umber of torpedo-bo-at destroyers and
":*rs fe'l in behind the battleships as
â¢.h*y rushed on to meet the hostile ves
**ls. In an hour the Kearsarge and her
consort! were In sight of the enemy.
As soon as she was In range the Kear
f arge opened fire with her secondary bat
tery. The other two battleships In turn
followed this action-
The conditions at this point, had It not
l><Â»en for the Olympiads wireless telegraph
rquipa-ent. Indicated that Rear Admiral
Sands might have reached an anchorago
In Winter Harbor.
Meanwhile the latter vessel had found
herself in a predicament. The fog, which
had been of aid to the enemy, proved of
disadvantage to the Oylmpia, for when It
lifted and Admiral Sands' vessels were
seen they were too close to the defending
vessel for her to escape.
i-'nder the rules of the maneuver! she
v.as overpowered by the superior force
And could do nothing but run up the
white flag and consider herself captured
by the hostile squadron.
OLYMPIA STJBJELENDKRS.
In an Irstant the operator in thÂ» wire
less telegraph room was signaling for the
KearEarge to announce the discovery of
the Ceet to Rear Admiral Barker. The
flagship, twenty-five miles away, off
Mount Desert Rock, caught the sound
waves and answered. In a few moments
â¢vrofd came by the wireless that the Kear
aarge was on her way to aid thÂ© Olym
ria.
Shortly after 4 o'clock the fogbank be
,cin to roil out to sea. and as the atmos
phere cleared even* man and officer of
the battleship searched the constantly en
larging field cf vision with anxiety. Sud
denly there came a cry, repeated Flmulta
neoutfy from various parts of the Olym
pia's superstructure, "There they are,
sir."
UAR HARBOR. Me.. Aug. S.-The naval
search problem, whici began last Wednes
day, when Rear Admiral Barker took up
liie plaa of defending the Maine coast
from a "hostile"' fleet which put to sea
oa Monday under Rear Admiral Sands,
ended early to-day, when the Oiympia,
the flagship of the defending fleet, dis
covered and intercepted the "white squad
roa" of the enemy, headed at full speed
for Winter Harbor. The hostile vessels
were rucnir^ in close order formation,
acd tad not the fog lifted at a favorable
moment it is thought the enemy would
have eluded those on guard. As it turned
cut. before her consorts could reach the
scene in answer to her signals the Oiym
pia had been forced to fly the white flag
and consider herself captured or destroyed
by the commander. The Olympic was the
farthest to the eastward of the defending
squadron and had a position twenty-five
miles outside Bakers Island for the great
er pert of three days. A thick fogbank,
which rolled in from the sea after mid
night, made It Impossible to cover the or
dinary cruising radius of the Oiympia,
and all that the men on Admiral Dewey'a
old flagship could do was to depend on
their ears and wait.

Ah Sing Claims It Is Discriminating
and Therefore a Violation
of Treaty.
Ah Sing of 115 Waverly place, who was
arrested a few days ago for violating
ordinance 937, which declares it a frac
ture of the law to expose gambling- de
vices in a room, into which free ingress is
Qot allowed the police, will test the con
stitutionality of the ordinance In the Su
perior Court. Yesterday he filed a suit for
a writ of prohibition preventing Police
Judge Conlan from proceeding with his
trial.
Sing claims the ordinance is unconstltu
tioral, because it discriminates against
the Chinese and is therefore a violation
of the treaty.
The cases of Richard Cornelius, presi
dent of the Street Carmen's Union, and
J. Kean, business agent of the City Front
Federation, charged with - refusing to
move on when requested fojdo so by Po
liceman J. F. Welch on Clay street on
Friday afternoon, were dismissed by Po
lice Judge Conlan yesterday morning.
There were direct contradictions in the
testimony given by Welch and Cornelius.
Welch testified that Cornelius and. Kean
were standing in front of Murray &
Ready's employment office, 634 Clay
street, with three other men and Corne
lius said they were not In frdnt of the
employment office and were not talking
to any men. Kean was ndt called upon
to testify.
The Judge asked Welch how many men
as a rule were in the employment office
at a time and Welch replied, "about 200."
The Judge said that Murray & Ready
should be arrested for violating the cubic
air ordinance. He blamed them for be
ing the means of blocking the sidewalk
with their bulletin boards and said they
were entirely at fault. In dismissing the
cases the Judge said the officer had made
a mistake in arresting the defendants, as
they were not the class of men who stood
In front of an employment office.
Judge Conlan Decides That Police
man Made a Mistake in
Arresting Them.

An examination of thÂ« records show* that
the sales In the 50-vara section alone amounted
to nearly one-half of the totals Tor the entire

â¢tngr on Pino street, below Montgomery, for
$300,000 and the San Francisco New B Com
pany building on Geary street, west of Powell,
for $215,000. There are plenty of buyers for
Rood property in the best business portion of
the 50-vara section with very little for sale.
Tha 100-vara section. Mission, Potrero an<l
South San Francisco are nearly uji) to the
hifjh average of recent months, while many
people are predicting that real estate In San
Krar.cisco ha3 reached the limit cf high. price
In nearly every case Â¦ it Is discovered that
these prophets are neither buyers nor sellers.
The best . property In San Kranclsco can to
day be sold for a higher price than ever be
fore. This does not mean that prices for the
best business property will not go higher, but
it does mean that buyers to-day will pay an
advance on apparently top prices for the best
business property.
Mrs. E. S. Kearns has sold to a client

SOME RECENT DEALS.
San Francisco realty sales in July
amounted to J3.8OO.50O, according to Magee
& Sons' Real Estate Circular. Large
transactions previously consummated but
not recorded until July served to swell
the total. In making an analysis of the
deals of July the Real Estate Circular
says :
Mary F. McGowan, who is being s'ued
for divorce by Phillip Edward McGo\fan,
filed an answer and cross-complaint to his
suit yesterday. She denies that Bho has
ever been cruel to him, as he charges,
and makes counter charges. She says he
drinks to excess, frequently beats and
abuses her, and has on many occasions
told her he wished she would die. Mrs.
McGowan charpes also that her husband
threatened to throw a lamp at her. and
once chased her with a carving knife.
Mary L. Delany is suing Joseph L. De
lany for divorce on the grounds of. intem
perance, neglectÂ»and cruelty, alleging that
because of his excessive use of intoxicants
and by his conduct while under their in
fluence she has been compelled to leave
him. They were married at Oakland, Sep
tember 26, 1S9S. and have two children,
the custody of whom Mrs. Delany asks
for and monthly alimony.
Desertion is the ground on. which Alice
C. Hawkes is suing Charles E. Hawkea
for divorce. , She charges that he left her
in January, 1899, less than three years
after their marriage at Berkeley.
Ferdinand It. Ramon, who In April last
was divorced from Sadie L. Ramon, took
his troubles to court again yesterday In a
petition for a modification of the decree.
He claim* that it Is unsatisfactory, in that
it compels him to call upon his former
spouse when he desires the society of his
child, which was awarded to the custody
of Mrs. Ramon, and thus exposes him to
the pain of bejnr refused even a short
time with the little one. The decree pro
vides that .Ramon shall have the privi
lege of taking his child out twice a, week,
or as often as is reasonable. He has been
in the habit of sending hi3 mother to the
home | of his former wife for the child.
Several times, he says, -Mrs. Ramon has
refused to allow the little one to accom
pany its grandparent, and he says the
last time his mother called Mrs. Ramon
told v her it was useless for her to call,
she could not have the child.
Ramon therefore asks the court to so
modify the decree that Mrs. Ramon shall
be compelled to bring the little one to his
home every Sunday and every Wednesday
of each week.

ELECTRO-CHEMISTRY cures many cases which under the
older methods of treatment are incurable. Here is another testi-
monial from a sufferer who had been given up by his doctors :
"My doctors gave me up. They said they could do nothing
for me, as I had consumption. Their treatment did me no good. I
reduced in weight from 137 to 108 pounds. I coughed, ;ny blood
did not circulate, my feet and hands were cold arid I was so weak I
could do nothing.' In this condition I took up the Electro-Chemic
treatment.
"In eight days I have gained eight pounds. My blood is cir-
culating, my cough is better, the chest pains are leaving me, I can
eat well, my food agrees with me and iny strength is rapidly re-
turning." (Signed) ALBERT TALLEY,

The State 'Board of Trade has received
from Manager Filcher a report concern
ing the crops and Industrial conditions in
California during the month of July.
Some extracts are as follows:
The grain crop, now almost completely har
vested, will aggregate materially less than an
average. Excepting In ' thÂ« irrigated districts
In the San Joaquln Valley, the crop . 1* not
much more than one-half of an average ._ while
In the Sacramento Valley, where a fair yield
was expected earlier In the season, considerable
damage resulted frqm a high north wind,
which whipped out from 15 to 20 per cent of
the unharvestsd wheat. The southern counties
report an exceptionally good grain crop. Letter
than for a number of years, but throughout
the great grain regions of the Sacramento and
Ban Joaquin valleys reports specify from one
half to three-quarters of an average crop.
The hay crop, which wa* harvested In June,
and referred to in our last Â¦ report as being
excellent In quality, but rather below tha av
erage in quantity, Is selling at very satisfac
tory prices, tha lowest reported for alfalfa be
ing |7 a ton, while the grain hays range In
price according to locality and quality from
$10 to S15 a ton, the latter price prevailing In
the foothill counties where the crop was very
light. The mountain hay crop, consisting
mostly, of meadow grasses in the higher moun
tain valleys and which was harvested during
the month of July, has turned out well and is
bringing satisfactory; prices. .While, as pre
viously stated, the crop on the. whole is short,
the amount realUed to the growers, by reason
of .better prices, will be greater , than an aver

In the three days covering the contest
for the cup the Americans scored only
one point, and that was on a default by
R. F. Doherty, occasioned by his accident.
The cup will be placed in "the custody of
the English Lawn Tennis Association. It
is quite probable an American team will
go to England next year In an effort to
regain It
H. L. Doherty's -marvelous ability to
overcourt undoubtedly won him the match
with Larned, although to the minds of
many an unfortunate decision at a crit
ical stage in the last' set was the cause
of the latter's failure. With the games
four-all in this last set and Larned with- ;
in one 'point of the ninth game, there
came a question on Doherty's second ser
vice. The linesman failed to call, arid
Larned, thinking It a double fault, start
ed to change courts, in the belief that the*
game was his. The referee decided the
point must be played over again. This
took the snap out of Larned at once, and
after that Doherty had little difficulty In
winning. **
The matches were played on adjoining
courts, and the 5000 tennis enthusiasts who
surrounded the lnclosure probably saw
the finest exhibition of tennis in the his
tory of the game. From the start the
excitement was Intense, and after each
match had been squared at the end of
four sets every one was on tiptoe until
II. L. Doherty won a longdence set, his
match and the necessary three points to
obtain possession of the cup. The crowd
still lingered to see the American favor
ite R. D. Wrenn finish his contest with
the elder of the Doherty brothers. At one
time It seemed Wrenn might possibly pull
out a victory, but the elder Doherty
proved too much for him. ;v'-.
Each of the contests to-day went a full

champion, defeating William P. Larned,

BOSTON, Aug. 8.â The International ten
nis trophy presented three years ago by
Dwlght F. Davis of this country goes to
England through the united efforts of R.
F. and H. L. Doherty, who clinched their
hold on the trophy by winning both
matches in singles to-day and scoring in
the entire contest four out of the total of
five points.
The list of vice presidents read by Wil
liam Meakin was long enough to pack the
stage, but many were absent. The meet
ing was in the nature of a rebuke to the
:if-pirations of Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz,
who Is ambitious to succeed himself. The
anti-Schmitz wing of the Labor party was
ready to cry out against its former stand
ard bearer. Meakin expressed himself as
opposed to the "Ruefâ Parry" ticket. He
r.aid the county committee, which he rep
resented, was the county committee rec
opnized by Judge Murasky and later sug
gested by the Eelection . Commissioners.

Congressman William J. Wynn also ad
dressed the- meeting. 'His speech was
hardly heard by reason of the noise by
the outgoing audience.
These are Ftrone words and I don't uso

therefore I want you worklngnien of San Fran
clbco to feel that with all the opportunities of
inquiry I have had, and with all the industry
1 could bring to bear, I have bwn driven to
the conclusion that the great danger to th<Â»
union, so far as the union labor movement is
concerned, is in the leper touch of Abraham
Ruef.

Chairman Meakin read an editorial from
a labor journal, which, he said, voiced
the opinion cf the labor party. He Intro
duced Congressman E. J. Livernash. who
delivered a dissertation on'the distribution
of wealth and the rights of the masses.
He also paid his respects to Abe Ruef
and Fire Commissioner Parry. In part
he spoke as follows:
It is naturally expected that many of
these subjects will pnyoke a general dis
cussion and lead to valuable suggestions!
that will greatly aid the committees that
will be appointed to secure national and
State legisaltion. One of the personal am
bitions of Mr. Richardson, he explained
yesterday, is to secure Indorsement of a
plan for a union meeting of the Trans-
Misslsslppl and the National Irrigation
congresses In St. Louis next year. He
'eald:
It would be productive o f great good to the
entire country if those two bodies would come
together and thoroughly discuss the various
important matters which" are vital to the in
terests of the members of both. It is possible
that some arrangement toward this end may
be accomplished at the coming meeting. We
are very fortunate in having as president of
the Trans-Misslsslppl Congress. John H. Klr
by. who is an Indefatigable worker in the In
terest of commercial advancement, and he has
Justly earned the title of industrial captain of
the South. The congress will remain in ses
sion continuously from August" 18. to the 20th.
Mr. Richardson said that It is estimated
that between 500 and 700 delegates will
attend the congress and among the sub
jects that will be discussed by the more
prominent speakers In the congress will
be the following: <**} '

SUBJECTS FOB, CONGRESS.
The commercial progress of California deeply
Interests the people of our section of the South,
for the interests of both sections are of a sort,
in common; that is, we have been working
along similar commercial lines. Your prosperi
ty during the last few years has been a repro
duction of oura. We have been developing our
industries, increasing our population, building
sky scrapers and organizing new banks and
trust companies, as hats been done in Califor
nia. In the last four years the banking re
sources of New Orleans have Increased 115 per
cent, which plainly tells what has been accom
plished in the State of Louisiana. The New
Orleans Progressive Union and kindred organ
izations in Louisiana and adjoining States have
been materially responsible for the advance
ment of our commercial Interests, for to the
efforts of these bodies were attributed the suc
cess of getting large commercial organizations
to hold their conventions in New Orleans and
in this way we were enabled to attract the per
sonal attention of visitors to our many Indus
tries and impress upon them the advantages of
investing. The results have been most remark
able. In one of our bodies we have a member
ship of 1600, which Is constantly planning and
working out projects for bringing more people
to the South; and I think that a similar scheme
would prove a great benefit to California and
the neighboring coast States.
INTERESTS IN COMMON.
Tom Richardson of New Orleans, man
ager of the New Orleans Progressive
Union, which ranks among the largest
commercial bodies in the United States,
arrived from Louisiana yesterday, accom
panied by his wife, and Is registered at
the Palace. Mr. Richardson" Is en route
to Seattle as a delegate to thÂ© Trans-
Mississippi Congress, which Is to convene
there on August 18. He Is a member of
the advisory board of the executive com
mittee of the congress and Is going to
Seattle In advance of the meeting to ar
range for the accommodations of the
Louisiana delegation and make prelimin
ary preparations for the proceedings of
the congress. Mr. Kichardson said yes
terday;
Ixmlslana will send a delegation of between
thirty-nve and forty, and I think that it will
be the largest representation that any State
has ever sent to a commercial congress in thla
country. In the (south we are locking forward
to the congress as one of the most interesting
that has been held, and I think there la Â«oou
reason for regarding It as such.
Many Important subjects are to.be discussed
and they will be handled by some of the ablest
men. The Texas and part of -the Louisiana
delegation will leave Houston by way of the
Southern Paclnc on August 12 and the party is
scheduled to reach Los Angeles on Friday next.
There the delegates will be entertained by the
local Chamber of .Commerce. The etay In Loa
Angeles, however! will be short, for the dele
gations are due In this city on the following
day. It would have been a great pleasure to
our representatives to-have remained In Ban
Francisco for several days, but their time Is
limited. After the congress is adjourned, how
ever, it is the intention of the majority of the
party to. make an extensive trip through Cali
fornia, and they will no doubt spend consider
able time In this city.

duty of the American and English nations to

Jewirh sufferers and to listen to the voice of
God expressed In the words, "Comfort ye,
comfort ye, my people, saith your.God."
Tho people of America and England, who
cherirh Ideas and ideals which are Jewish In
character as well as in origin, owe a special
debt of gratitude to IsraeJ, from whom they
have learned among other things the sublime
principle of "righteousness which exaJteth a
nation."
The charge given to the prophets to comfort
the Jewish fxlles In Babylon has a special
significance In modern tlir.es when applied to
the two great nations of the Anglo-Saxon
race, who. like the prophets of old, stand upon
their spiritual heights and t^ach the lessons
of freedom and justice to the. rest of the

Twice within a very short. time San Francisco has seen rewarded a policeman who risked his
own life that he might save those of others. These acts of. bravery and their subsequent acknowl
edgment passed almost without notice, and it is well-to think that this heroic officer, doing his

A QUITE interesting historical discussion has arisen concerning the religious views and prac
, / Y tices of the patriot Thomas Paine. In his own day he was stigmatized as an infidel, and that
/ \ tradition has become so firmly established that his works are not in common circulation, and
Â¦*Â¦ Vif found in a library their presence is apt to be the subject of excuses. Paine's father was
a Quaker; his mother was an independent Methodist. The original Quakers held theological views
that conform closely to what is now known as the modern Unitarian view, which was held also
by Jefferson. J
Paine's "Age of Reason" confirms the fact that his opinions were formed on those of his
father, though there is some evidence that wkile in independent business in England, as a master
stay-maker, he had some associations with his mother's people,. the Methodists. Even ; this would
" hardly relieve him of the charge of infidelity, since the Methodists of . that day were held to be
heterodox to the verge, of infidelity by the Calvinistic sentiment of the orthodox world.
It is certain that after his return to this country from France his associations were with the
Quakers. But this did. not relieve him of the charge of infidelity, since the Quakers had been perse
cuted for that offense. He was made to feel his, outlawryby the theological sentiment of the time.
Being over in New Jersey on business he was identified and refused the right to buy passage on a
public coach and had to make the journey back to North River on foot. In his last 'days he lived
with a Quaker family, who supplied evidence of the falsity of the death-bed ; scene which mistaken
piety invented, and he was buried in the Quaker at New Rochelle, which could not have
been had he not been fellowshipped by those people. Â¦â¢::Â¦,

Such is the destructiveness of the solu
tion that within a few hours after It ig
applied the withering process begins, and
microscopic tests prove that the liquid
penetrates the growth below the water,
killing the roots, as already stated. Por
tions of the dead growth which have been
pulled from the bottom of the St. Johns,
where tho treatment has been applied,
show that the effect of the chemical Is to
rot the fiber and disintegrate It to such
an extent that if no longer offers resist
ance to navigation. The solution kills the
seed as well as the plant, and efforts are
made to cover as much space during the
seeding season as possible. The work has
been done under the direction of the
United States engineers.
however, seems to have solved the prob
lem of how to destroy the hyacinth, and
it is believed that if sufficient equipment
is provided eventually all of tho Southern
water courses may be cleared of the pest
permanently. A chemical has been com
pounded which has such an effect upon
the plant that If it comes in contact with
the stem or blossom these portions soon
wither; but the solution is so powerful
that It works its way down the stem,
killing the root as well. Some of the in
gredients of the chemical are known only
to the inventor, but a large quantity of
acid Is used in its preparatton.
The process of manufacture is very sim
ple, the "laboratory" being placed upon
a barge provided with two tanks, each of
wh:;h has a capacity of 5000 gallons.
Connected with the tanks Is a boiler in
which the ingredients are mixed at a high
temperature produced by steam heat. The
barge is of such light draught that it can
be towed by the spraying boat if desired,
but the latter Is provided with three res
ervoirs each holding S500 gallons, which
are filled by pumping from the barge.
Pipes lead from, the reservoirs to a steam
pump which supplies the spraying appar
atus. This consists of three booms. One
extends directly in front of the vessel,
being supported by a block and tackle at
tached to the bow deck. XKe others pro
ject from the sides of the vesseL The
sprayers consist of hollow tubes which
are perforated at intervals of about a
foot and the holes fitted with miniature
nozzles. The liquid Is forced Into the
sprayers through lines of hose which are
connected to the sprayers by couplings in
the usual manner. The arrangement of
the sprayers is such that the chemical
can be distributed over a space ninety
feet in width when the boat Is moving.
The boat containing the spraying appar
atus is of the type of craft used on
Southern rivers, drawing but four or five
feet of water. She Is provided with very
powerful engines in proportion te her
size in order to drive her through the
masses of hyacinths, and is so modeled
as to offer as little resistance to the ob
struction as possible. Her reservoirs
carry a sufficient supply of chemical to
cover about 100,000 square yards, and on a
portion of the stream where the growth
Is not too rank the 6teamer will treat this
area of surface in a day. In places where
the side sprayers cannot be utilized on
account of trees or other obstruction, the
chemical is applied to the plants by means
of ordinary hose operated by members of
the crew.
During the last year experiments have
been tried under the supervision of the
Government with the Idea of ridding the
Southern waterways of the hyacinth. As
is well known the variety known as the
water hyacinth spreads bo rapidly and
has such a rank growth In Florida and
Louisiana that it has seriousl" Inter
fered with navigation and In some cases
has completely blocked streams which
had hitherto been available 'or the use
of light-draught steamers.
The hyacinth has been â¢ especially
troublesome on the SL Johns River.
Florida, where various schemes have been
tried to destroy it. One of the plans was
to equip a steamboat with a propeller
provided with blades having very sharp
edgres. with the view of cutting away the
prowth below the surface. It was be
lieved that this treatment would cause
the plants to die. but the benefit was
only temporary. While lanes of open
water were made by the action of the
rapidly moving propeller, they were soon
fllltd with the hyacinth and this scheme
was abandoned. At some of the smaller
wharves on the St. Johns River the
srowth has been so thick that It has
been necessary to go out in boats and
cut away with sickle and knife a large
area In order to allow a vessel to moor
at the dock, while some of the smaller
wharves have been Abandoned, as the
plant stows so thickly about them that
a boat driven by quitÂ© powerful engines
Is In danger of becoming blocked. In tbÂ«
midst of a bed, unable to extricate Itself.
, The method which Is now being- tried.
Sftne of these vessels are of
very lar^e dimensions, having a carrying
capacity ranging between 4000 and 500J
tons, and equal in size to many "tramp"
â¢hips of the small class which are en
paged in the trans-Atlantic trade. To
\ring these chips to the seaboard and
rhrough the Canadian canal sj-stem has
required some interesting engineering
featsâ in fact, some ships are of such
length that it has been found necessary
to cut them into two pieces to allow them
to pass through the locks of some of the
s-mail canals.
The American Shipbuilding Company at
its Cleveland yard has recently completed
several vessels intended for the American
soacoast trade. As it was impossible to
teach tide water except by way of the
Wetland canal and the St. Lawrence sys
tem they were planned with the view of
bring divided as stated. One of these
Â»-hips. the Minnetonka, now in this port
with her sister ship the Minnewaska, re
cently made the voyage from Cleveland to
the head of the St. Lawrence system.
Hrre she was placed in a drydock and
divided Just forward of her engine-room.
The openings wer<Â» filled with a bulwark
composed of a framework of timber sup
porting heavy planks, the spaces between
the edses of the plank being made water
lipht by calking. The two sections were
thon taken through the canals without
difficulty, the rear_ portion being moved
by its own engine and guided by the tug
boat, the forward section, of course, be
ing towed. In this manner the steamship
was taken to Levis. Quebec, where the
sections were placed in the drydock of
Davie & *>n and Joined together.
In constructing the Minnetonka the hull
plates as well as ribs were planned so
that the division could be made with com
paratively little expense, and but a few
days were required to Join the parts of
the \'essel. Owing to the method of con
struction the reunited hull is as stiff as if
it had never been cut in two. The accom
panying photographs show the after sec
tion of the vessel passing through the
canals and the whole vessel after the two
parts were Joined together In the Levis
dock.
THE construction of steamships
ar.d barges In yards on the
Great Lakes, as is well known,
has included a fleet built for the
ocean -as well as lake service.
As July draws to a close the general
activity of the publishing firms decreases.
Only a few occasional novels are passing
through the presses.
It may. however, be interesting: to learn,
on the authority of one of the leading
London booksellers, that the best selling
work of fiction at the present moment is
George Lorimer's "Letters from a Self
made Merchant to His Son."
There is not a little wonder expressed
in many quarters at the high price of Â£1000
($5000) which has been paid by the Burns
Monument and Cottages Trustees for the
copy in Jhe best state known of the Kll
marnock Burns. The Lamb copy, which
was sold in 1837 for Â£572 (CS60). was hith
erto the highest price.
This copy; bought from G. S. Veltch of
Paisley, has the label on the back and la
in every way faultless. Mr. Veitch pur
chased it for Â£ip ($50). It appears a copy
could be had in the early fifties for on**
shilling. That was the price paid by
James Stillle for one purchased at a sale
at Lelth. William Pickering paid Â£5 (%Z\}
for a copy. One was catalogued in 1S70
for eighteen guineas ($34 50).
A romance of Alexandria in its early
days will be published in the autumn by
Fisher Unwin. The title Is "Tychiade3, a
Tale of the Ptolemies." The book pro
fesses to be a volume out of the famous
Alexandrian Library, preserved through
the vicissitudes of time down to the pres
ent day. The hero is a young Asiatic
Greek, who makes a journey to IIellopoli3
in the hope of solving the riddle of exis
tence, carrying with him a chest contain
ing manuscripts. On setting foot in Alex
andria he provokes excitement in the
breasts of many citizens, for It is believed
he is in possession of priceless manu
scripts of Ari3totle. Attempts are made
to waylay him. He, reaches Heliopolls in
circumstances very' different from those
which he had dreamed. Interwoven with
the story is a mass of historical Informa
tion.
m)HN COLEMAN has written a
biography of Charles Reade, whom
he knew Intimately. For that rea
son it will have a personal touch
and many reminiscences of the
qjr novelist. His books still sell well,
but of the man himself the younger gen
eration has perhaps little knowledge.
Mr. Coleman's book, which Messrs. Tre
hane are to oublish, will be illustrated.
Publishers are very chary of making
any official announcements as to their
forthcoming lists of autumn publishing,
but the following notes will be found
interesting:
William Le Queux has a story on hand
for early publication, entitled "The
Twickencote Treasure." Messrs. Newnes
are to publish it within a month's time.
Mr. Murray has^a number of interest
ing books forthcoming. The "Personal
Reminiscences of the Duke of Welling
ton," by Francis, first Earl of Ellesmere.
edited by his daughter, tho Countess of
Stafford, include unpublished memoranda.
Mr. Murray has also in hand "Leaves
from the Diary of a Soldier and Sports
man," during a varied course of service,
from 18G5 to 18S5. This i3 by Lieutenant
General Sir Montagu Gerard.
Messrs. Longman have in hand an inter
esting book by Julian S. Corbett, entitled
"England in the Mediterranean," which
several papers have already speculated
on. It is definitely settled that this book
will see the light during the autumn pub
lishing. The same firm will also publish
this autumn "The Valet's Tragedy, and
Other Studies in Secret History," by An
drew Lang, and "A Queen of Tears â Caro
line Matilda," by W. H. "Wllkins, In which
the short life of the younger sister of
George III will be examined.

WELL KNOWN NOVELIST. THE SUBJECT OF A NEW BIOGRAPHY
CONTAINING MANY REMINISCENCES OF A WRITER WHOSE
BOOKS ARE STILL WIDELY READ IN THIS COUNTRY.
CERTAIN walking delegates or other agents of labor unions in New York have, been con
victed of. betraying the trust of the unions and of obtaining and converting to their own
use large sums of money obtained from business men nominally for the purpose of pre
venting or settling strikes. The^evjdence given in court has been somewhat sensational,
and naturally has been the subject of a/gqQd deal of District Attorney Jerome, as his
contribution to the subject, has said that the' practices v of the convicted labor men are not dissimilar
to those of the average politician, or the average business man ; and has thereby not only given occa
sion for more talk, but has infused the controversy with a good deal of heat.
In the course of his statement the District Attorney said : "Everybody who has studied public
life has been appalled at its corruption.. There.is a general belief that every State Legislature and
the national Legislature are given to 'grafting. 5 ! It*is felt that 1 they are actuated by other than pure
motives. Why should public life be so debauched? ,1 have come to the conclusion that it is only a
reflection of private life. There is 'grafting' everywhere.. I know a man who said he would furnish all
the lubricating oil used on the railroad systems of the country, and warrant that it 1 should be up to
the standard, and pay a lump sum of $50,000 for ; the contract, charging only 75 per cent of what the
roads now pay. This so'rt of tiling runs through everything, high and low." v
Within certain limits Mr. Jerome's statement must be accepted as true. The walking delegates
who extracted/or perhaps extorted, large sums of money from business men under threat of calling
out their employes were engaged in a practice not dissimilar to that of ( the high Postoffice officials of
whose offenses we have been hearing so much of late; and the postal officials can doubtless defend
their conduct by citing a host of not dissimilar practices among business men. Still when all that
has been conceded there will remain ample ground for disputing the assertion that "grafting prevails
everywhere."
Byron has told 'us that doctors and lawyers see only the worst side of life; . and Jerome, as
District Attorney of New York, has seen a 'particularly bad side of it. The grafter bears about the
same relation to politics and to business that a parasite bears to the animal it preys upon. A vig
orous life like that of the United States doubtless sustains many grafters, but they are not numerous
enough, nor capacious enough, to seriously-hurt any important part of the social organism. In labor
unions, in politics and in business the grafter is an exception to tlie rule of American life. Should it
ever become otherwise, this country will become as one of the republics of South America.
THE PRACTICE OF GRAFTING.
AN interesting sign of the times is the attack on Booker. Washington in a negro meeting in
Boston. He was present to advise the members of his race on the lines of his well-known
philosophy of their needs. He has been heretofore Â¦ antagonized by negro lawyers and
preachers, who assail his ideas of industrial development, and who assume that their race
has already, as a body, taken all the steps intermediate between the lowest barbarism and the high
est civilization. -
This assumption is at variance with the facts, and is intended to cut the ground from under
Washington's plans. He appreciates fully the backward state of the negro, intellectually, morally and
industrially. He is much wiser in dealing with the negro than our Government has been in dealing
with the Indian. The Government and certain religious bodies have assumed that it is only neces
sary to teach Indians - algebra and catechism, and presto! they step from blankets into breeches,
and are civilized, when in truth their condition is \vorse than before. .'Â¦
The regeneration and progress, of a race begins with industrial capacity to supply its wants
on a constantly increasing scale. 1 As Washington says, the negro must be taught to earn and save
until he can afford a better shelter than a house of one room. With more rooms come more wants,
taxing his skill to earn what will supply them. As his wants multiply he is advancing in civilization,
ind has a motive for increasing his skill and earning capacity, and the thrift which economizes
what he earns. *
It may seem strange to say that energetic and evey violent opposition by negroes to Wash
ington's ideas is a hopeful sign, but it is. ' The hardest, task among men is to get 'them to think.
They would better begin thinking wrong than not think at all. It is better that the negroes should
divide into parties upon the issues presented by Washington, for a solution will come sooner by
division than by a unity which would permit Booker Washington to do all the thinking for the race,
while the rest blindly and submissively followed his lead. Already negroes are in hot discussion over
the Boston outbreak. Those who justify it have to do some thinking for reasons to sustain their posi
tion, and those who deprecate it also have to think. As Booker Washington is right by all the
known standards, all thinking adds to his followers. It must be a very- besotted . negro who would
not rather have a house of many rooms than of one. It must be a very low negro who would not
rather have comfortable clothes, good food, regular meals, a home of his own and feel the pride of
a parent in the better prospects of his children, than be a vagabond..^
If the ideas o.f Washington are rejected by his race, and it prove unsusceptible of receiving
what they offer, then its fate is sealed. It has no. higher destiny before it than some form of servitude.
As far as its future in this country is concerned in such case, it must be deported or exterminated.
This may seem harsh, but it is said in the belief that the race is rightly judged by Booker Wash
ington to be capable of something better. Its most virulent enemy, Senator Tillman, admits this;
by insisting that the negro shall not have any education, industrial or scholastic. If he be incapable
of receiving, assimilating or benefiting by either, there is no need to deny him that which he cannot
use. So Tillman admits the possibilities in Washington's methods.
The Boston negroes and all others who oppose Washington will perhaps observe that they are
on Tillman's side, and that eruptive person will have occasion, later on, to boast that liis followers
are among the most backward and reactionary of the negroes. We incline to the opinion that Wash
ington and his negroes will finally overcome Tillman and his niggers.

Charles McLain and H. H. McGonlgle of
Flagstaff, in the employ of the Canyon
Electric Power Company, left Cameron's
Camp, at Indian Gardens, in the Grand
Canyon, with the intention of crossing
the Colorado River to their camp on the
north side. This was the last seen of
them. Falling to return ' to the Indian
Gardens at the time agreed upon, it was
thought something had happened, and on
Wednesday, the 29th, N. J. Cameron^and
K D. Boucher started to search for them.
A trail was found on the- river's edge
where the men had launched their boat.
The search was kept up, however, in the
hope that the men had made a landing
farther down the river, and dynamite was
exploded frequently tn the hope of at
tracting their attention If they were still
alive.
On Monday of this week, Julius Aubl
neau and George McGonlgle of Flagstaff,
& brother of one : of the missing men,
reached the canyon with & boat and on
Wednesday the searching party crossed
the river, hoping that the men had
reached the north side. No sign was

election laws:
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 7. 1903.
George W. Wittman Esq.. Chief of Police â
Dear Sir: From experience gained during the
last two primary elections, it has been plain
that In some cases police officers have been
unaware of thÂ« fact that the general election
laws, with all penalties for infraction, are in
full force and effect at all primary elections
in this city. I therefore desire to have you
call the attention of the men detailed for duty
on next Tuesday. August 11. to the necessity
of a strict observance of the law, to the end
that each and every citizen desiring to par
ticipate tn the primary election will be af
forded an opportunity to freely express his
choice and be protected from any interfer
ence, especially within thÂ« 100-foot line.
This last named provision of the election law
has probably been violated more than any
other, and Its strict observance will conduce
to an orderly election.
Tuesday. August 1L the day of the pri
mary election, will* be a holiday in San
Francisco. Yesterday Mayor Schmitz

To the Electors of the City and County of
San Francisco: Your attention is respectfully

The United Republican League stands for
everything which Martin Kelly is not anJ for
nothing which Martin Kelly Is, and Its dele
gates are pledged against him and his kttid of
politics and are otherwise absolutely free, un
tramtneled and unpledged. They are not com
mitted or pledged to any candidate for any of
fice whatever, nor to any man or set of men.
The object of the United Republican League
is to unify on a solid and decent basis. every
element fcf the Republican party in the inter
eft of a sound, honest and businesslike admin
istration of our governmental affairs.
This iÂ» the same Martin Kelly whose par
ticipation heretofore In Hepuullcan politics has
drawn from the party many an apology and
brought ur>on n. many a defeat; the Mnrtin
Kelly whose name is a synonym of corruption
and of everything that is vile In politics, and
whoee elimination and suppression from all
pretension to leadership is one r>t the objects
for which the United Kepubi'.can I>agua was
organised. If his name appeared on all the

Despite his 64 years of age and his long
term of service, General Miles is still a
man of much vigor, as was lately demon
strated by his making a horseback jour
ney of ninety miles In eight hours.
He commanded the army during the war
with Spain in 1898 and had personal charge
of the expedition for the capture of Porto
Rico, which was quickly effected with
little or no loss. ,
In 1869 he was transferred to the Fifth
Infantry, and. December 15, 1SS0, made
brigadier-general. April 5, 1S90, he became
major-general, and October 5, 1865, he suc
ceeded to the command of the army. He
was made lieutenant-general June 6, 1900.
General Miles conducted several very
successful campaigns against hostile In
dians In the West, notably against the
Apaches under Geromlno and Natchez,
whom he finally compelled to surrender in
1SS6. He commanded the United States
troops in service in Chicago during the
great railway strike of 1894, and did much
to restore order on that occasion. â¢
He represented the United States army
at* the seat of Turco-Greclan war of 1S97
and also at Queen Victoria's Diamond
Jubilee In June of the same year.
He was mustered out of the volunteer
service September 1, 1S66. and entered the
regular army, where he rose by regular
grades to the very top.
General Miles bore a gallant part in all
of the heavy battles in which the Army
of the Potomac was engaged, except one.
and was twice severely wounded. Before
he was quite 25 years of age he was com
manding one of Grant's army corps.
In 1S66 he was made colonel of the
Fortieth Infantry. March 2. lao/. he was
brevetted brigadier-general of the United
States army -for. gallant and meritorious
service at the batt^ of Chancellorsvllle.
Va., in 1863. and major-general for same
service at Spottsylvania Courthouse. Va..
in . 1864, receiving . a medal of honor for
gallantry In connection- with the first
brevet.
General Nelson Appleton Miles was
born at Westminster, Mass., August 8.
1839, and began the forty-two years of
service, which closed by his retirement
yesterday as captain In the TweÂ«ty-sec
ond Regiment. Massachusetts Volun
teers. September* 9, 1S61. May 31. 1862, he
was made lieutenant-colonel of the
Sixty-first New York Volunteers, and In
September 30 following colonel of that
regiment.
May 12. 1861, hÂ© was made brigadier
general for distinguished services during
the battles of the Old Wilderness and
Spottsylvanla Courthouse. On August 25,
1864. he was brevetted major-general of
volunteers for highly meritorious and dis
tinguished conduct throughout that
memorable campaign, and , particularly
for gallantry and valuable service at the
battle of Reams Station. Va. October 21.
1865, he was commissioned as major-gen
eral of volunteers. r '.'
BBILLIANT WAB RECORD.
At a given signal the model was dis
patched on its voyage. A better launch
ing could not have been desired. The
Smithsonian scientists believed that the
highest hopes .were about to be realized,
but after the first few seconds of flight
the wings were deflected and the flying
machine went downward until Its course
was ended on the mud bottom of the Po
tomac. She was traveling at a velocity
of about forty miles an l^our. When the
machine was raised from the water a
workman attempted to cover it with a
cloth, but for a long time was unable to
do so. Its mechanism and dimensions .were
plainly seen. It was equipped with four
wings, two on each side, about four by six
feet, made of the finest oil silk, and held
upon delicate . wooden rods. The wings
were shaped like a tent." /The body con
sisted of an Intricate arrangement of
fine steel rods with cylinders, motor and
boilers carefully balanced. Between the*
two sets of wings were situated the pro
pellers, two In number, equipped with two
blades. The steering gear was situated
at the rear and was constructed from ma
terial like the" wings. The motor is sup
posed to generate something In excess of
two horsepower.
Several photographs were secured of the
machine In flight. The wind against which
It flew was blowing about four miles an
hour. After the experiment ; Asistant
Manley refused to make any statement
for publication.
WLN'DEWATER, Va., Aug. 8.â A partly
successful experiment with thÂ© Â¦fifteen
foot'Langley airship was made to-day
from the houseboat in the Potomac River
off this point. The aero-drume, started
well In a straight line south with a veloc
ity of 700 feet per second and flew for a
distance variously estimated at from four
to 600 yards. Some deflections in the wind
soon after the launching caused It to take
a downward course, which. It followed
rapidly and was impelled into the water
under the full power, of her engine. There
was sufficient steam generated for a rapid
flight of a half or three-quarters of a mile.
Under the full pressure of this force the
machine struck the water and a moment
later had â¢ disappeared from view. The
machine was recovered. It was consid
erably damaged.
The machine was removed to the house
boat, where extensive repairs will have to
be made before another test can be pulled
off. i V, : . r : i . Â¦
Itary secretary, left the "War Department
a few minutes before 12 o'clock.
About thÂ« time that General Miles "was
leaving the department Lieutenant Gen
eral Young,- accompanied by his aids,
came across from the War College office
and went Immediately to pay his respects
to Secretary Root. General Young to-day
was the recipient of a. large basket of
flowers sent by Mrs. Roosevelt.

Jack London is 27 years old. At 18
years of aee he had been a newsboy,
longshoreman, bay sailor, seal fisher, and
then turned to sociology and economics.
He became a trams to know the under
side of life. Then he read and studied,
went to the Oak.and Hlch School, took
a* freshman course at the University of
California, but gave up his studies and
went to the Klondike. There he gath
ered much of the material that started
him on the* road to literary success. In
January, 1S99. "The Man On the Trail"
appeared, followed by "The White Si
lence," and rapidly came othersâ tales of
the Arctic Circle. "The Son of the Wolf"
and the "God of His Fathers," "Daugh
ter of the North" and "The Children of
the Frost"â all gave testimony to the bud
bed genius. These and others were in
corporated into a volume, "An Odyssey
of the North." They made a name for
the young, erratic genius who had only
a few years before been arrested on Oak
land's streets for public speaking as a
socialistic devotee.
STATEMENTS REFUSED.
He wrote the "Cruise of the Dazzler,"
a children's tale, and then, with Miss
Strunsky, put forth "The Kempton-Wace
Letters."
A recent trip to London and long search
and study in the slums gave him mate
rial for a book, "Children of the Abyss,"
now in press. '
Prolific with pen, London was shy of
words to-night >,when asked about tho
parting of, himself and his wife. All he
said was:
At present there is nothing to be said on
either side. It Is patent to every one that my
wife and I are not living together, but as to
the cause of the separation 1 have nothing to
say. At this time I -cannot nay whether di
vorce proceedings will be Instituted. In fact I
have nothing at all to say In regard to the
matter. My wife and I have separated and we

AKLAND, Aug. 8.â "Jack" Lon
! S Â¦ don, newsboy. tramp, sailor,
roustabout, boy socialist and au
thor, writer of the anonymously
published "Kempton-Wace Letters" and
heralded genius, has found marriage . a
failure. Love and literature don't min
gleâat least, not in the brilliant young
Californian's life. He and his wife of
barely three years have separated.
Agreed are they that love is not for them
together, the talented creator of "The
Call of the Wild" and the mother of his
two children have cried "quits." He has
gained the freedom his soul has craved
and both are content.
She was Miss Elizabeth Maddern, mem
ber of a family of blood kin to Minnie
Maddern Fiske, the gifted actress. The
Madderns' home tor years has been at
1667 Broadway. They met because Miss
Maddern was in the literary circle. She
knew books and was by bent and calling
thrown much among those who read and
talk and write. Miss Maddern was a
teacher,^had pupils whom she assisted in
Btudlesâ was in school and college life,
and met London when his stories of the
Arctic regions gained him vogue in lit
erary life.
They were married and two children,
Joan and Bess, who have gone with their
mother, were born.
Of late there had been whisperings of
domestic infelicities in the familyâ of dif
ferences which brought discord. Friends
of Mrs. London said her successful au
thor-husband had grown beyond her at
mosphere and was chafing under the yoke
of matrimony. However that may be,
they have parted and they have agreed
that for the present at least there ehall
be no explanations for the public.
WETTINGS PROPHETIC.
Mrs. London has retired into quiet re
treat at Berkeley. "Jack" has taken bach
elor quarters at. 1216 Telegraph avenue,
there to work out books and plans for
more stories that are shortly to be given
to the world.
More than mere coincidence attaches to
the story of 'The Kempton-Wace Let
ters," that only sixty days or so ago were
issued from London's publishers. They
tell of love, and current talk has It that
they disclose the Inmost thoughts of the
author on that subject of subjects. In
deed, only to the favored few was it
known for a long time that London's
brain had evolved the volume that has at
tracted no little comment. Collaborating
was Anna Strunsky in this book of mes
sages^the thoughts of Herbert Wace
(London) and Dane Kemptonâ the story
of a man who had made of love a "cold,
analytical text." So In the title page Is
inscribed:
And of naught else than Love would we dis
course. â Dante.
With more than prophetical pen does
"Wace" write of the lovers after mar
riage:
Our lovers discover each other to be mere
man and woman, after all. That ethereal sub
stance which the man took for the body of
the loved one becomes flesh and blood, prone
to the common weaknesses and ills of flesh and
blood. He. on the other hand, betrays Â¦ little
petulancles of deposition, little faults and pre
dispositions of which she never dreamed in the
prenuptlal days, and which she now finds emi
nently distasteful. But > at first these Â¦ things
are not openly unpleasant. There are no
scenes. OnÂ« or the other gives In on the in
nai.t, without B*lf-betrayal. and one or . the
other retires to have a secret cry or ' to rumi
nate about it over a cigarâ the first faint hints.
I may slyly sBggest.: of the return of rationali
ty. They are .beginning to think.
Ah. these are little things, you nay. Pre
cisely; wherefore I lay emphasis on. them. â¢ The
sum of the Innumerable little things, becomes
a mighty thing to test the human soul. More

THE GOVERNOR'S GREETING.
Tho scntlmeht3 of welcome are thus ex
pressed by 'Governor Pardee:
Once again the State of California and â¢ the
city of S,an Francisco - have the pleasure and
the honor to hospitably' welcome the veterans
of. the Civil War. . Our pleasure Is great when
we open wide our arms and give Â¦ them --the
kiss of welcome. And we feel Â¦ honored that
the men "who" survived* the shock .of battle.'
that laid low so many of our friends and their
comrades, have again .chosen .California - and
San Francisco for their gathering place. But,
with our- smiles of welcome, with .the pleas-'
ure and the honor-that they have - conferred
upon us. there is mingled a sorrow.' and with
our smiles there springs â¢ tears to our eyes as
we look upon the fast thinning ranks of those
who. bravely fought for us In "61 and ,'65. , The
gray hairs, the stooped shoulders, the halting
steps, the' thinned ranks, all tell us that those
whom the nation has -always - loved' tb honor
will not. In obedience to the - inexorable law
of nature, long 'be .with us. And. when .they, ;
like their comrades who have, gone before,
sleep the eternal sleep that knows no waking,
when, on every Memorial day.- our nation
pauses from Us usual vocations .: to bestrew
with flowers the narrow cells In which they
wait the reveille of . the resurrection morn,
their deeds then will still be recounted and
rehearsed In song and poetry and oratory, and
the hearts of their weeping countrymen will
swell with . pride and gratitude for what they
did when, but for them, our nation . would
have split In twain. â¢ Â¦
Â¦Â¦ But let' us . not,. -In - anticipation of- a sad
future, forget the pleasures of. a happy pres
ent. Let us rather rejoice that time has dealt
as gently as it has with those of them who
still are with us. Â¦ Let us deck 'with; flowers
and blossoms and our country's glorious colors
the living heroes who are with us still. Let
us cheer them as -they march our streets, and
show them that our gratitude has not departed
from us nor our ardor cooled from the heat
and Â¦ fervor I that filled all our : breasts when
Sumter fell ' and all our eyes , were : turned
toward r Appomattox. Â¦ -â¢Â¦... , . .-â¢ . ,
In common with all patriotic Americans, I
would that I could call these gray-haired
heroes ' "comrades." That â¢ pleasure and honor
being â¢ denied me. I hail them as "friends."
and welcome them to California, in. the name
of all our people, as "benefactors'* . and
"saviors of our common country."
THE MAYOR'S > SUGGESTIONS.
Eugene E. Schmltz, Mayor of San Fran

THE Thirty-seventh . National En

San Francisco has planned a reception to the
veterans , worthy of their visitors. Its plans
have been ' heralded â¢ all over the East. - No
event that has taken place in San Francisco
has had so much publicity throughout the
country as has the approaching encampment.
No ' event since 18S6 has ' been looked forward
to by the Grand Army of the Republic with
so much pleasurable anticipation.
,. The - committee has worked faithfully for
months to carry' out the r.lans outlined to
make' this 1 the- most brilliant encampment in
the -annals of the Grand Army of -the Repub
lic; The veterans residing In California have
given of their time.. means and. best energy to

people . of . the : interior ' are : ready to receive

Only a few. days hence and San Francisco
will. have within Its gates, as honored guests,
the. Grand Army of the Republic. It is an
honor that we may Justly feel proud of to have
the veterans, the savers and preservers of -the
Union, choose for their national reunion, twice
in .the past seventeen years, the city which
lies .farthest from the center of population;
that these old and brave warriors should de
sire to return to the very end of the continent
because of the cordial reception tendered and
the hospitality lavished upon them seventeen
years ago. They have evldentty not forgotten
California's generous hospitality, typical of
the true Western host. While these vetsrans
come â¢ to . us of their own choice they nave
been Invited to visit us and share with us.
with their wives, their children, and their
friends, for a time at least, the delightful cli
mate of California. We sent a delegation to
the last National Encampment, clothed with
authority from the people by the Governor of
California, the. Mayor of San Francisco and of
all the large communities of the State, asking
the veterans to come to us, promising them a
more cordial welcome. Â¦Â¦ more generous hospi
tality, than any other city In the land from
the Atlantic to the Pacific/ They accepted our
Invitation, â¢ turned their backs upon all com
petitors ' and chose San Francisco, thousands
of miles from their homes, .In preference.
While it Is true that those of them who were
our guests seventeen years ago did not need
urging to come again, they should be accorded
as cordial a reception upon their second visit
when' they return to us with locks whitened
and made venerable with years. They have
sung the praises of California abroad In the
land, during all these years and chanted the
gospel of its hospitality among their comrades
at every .encampment. The host of others,
those -who come among us for the first time,
lured by the tales of our generosity, by the
promises made through our delegation,- they
shall not, > must Â¦ not, be disappointed. Those
brave hearts must be accorded a welcome by
the- whole people of California befitting the
occasion. - The men who nearly, forty years ago
answered the nation's call to arms, who for the
time forsook. hearth and home, family and all
else and rallied around their country's flag to
save â¢ and . preserve this glorious Union, will
come among - us as our guests. They have
journeyed thousands of miles across the con
tinent- to again be -united within our gates.
They will parade our streets, bearing- aloft
their tattered emblems of the loftiest freedom
known/to the nations of the earth, their path
lighted by a halo of glory, unequaled In his
tory. Â¦ - * Â¦ Â¦â¢ '...---Â¦
GENERAX SHAFTER SPEAKS.
The people of San Francisco owe It to them
selves, as well I as to the men of the great
war,- to extend the open handed hospitality for
which we -are famous, even beyond the meas
ures . of previous . occasions of this character,
and to support and assist the earnest and
hard ..working local committees in charge,
financially 'as well as morally.
greater and more consequential than that of
any like aggregation of Americana who might
make a. -similar trip. to our coa*t. ,-â¢'.-
Incidentally, having accumulated more or less
of. this world's Â¦ goods and having that knowl
edge â¢ of the world which I has shown to them
that it is as. blessed to give as . to receive, our
merchants, our- business men our artisans and
wage earners generally will feel the benefit of
their liberal. and sensible expenditure.
. And . their presence' here, the entertainments
and fetes" organized In their behalf will bring
vast multitudes to our city from surrounding
dtles, for. pleasure and for participation. ".All
these will tarry here for tha benefit of our
trade and the enjoyment of our people.
The holding i of this Grand Encampment of
the 'Grand Army' of the Republic, even from
the most material standpoint, means much to
San Francisco. I ' have no doubt that sev
eral million dollars will be left here as one of
the results of their, visit.
From, this viewpoint the coming encampment
Is likely to be remembered as one of the most
fruitful promotion enterprises of the times. It
will prove.- also, a valuable object-lesson to the
rising generation In our midst. To children of
a few years of age seventeen years asro, now
grown to men and women, the sight and society
of the survivors of the gigantic national strug
gle which took place before they were born,
should have the effect of Increasing their lore
of country and -flag, and make of them better
citizens, and it wilt be a great opportunity for
the children of to-day, for It Is Improbable that
The occasion will also produce a fresh crop
of tourist visitors, who everywhere will add to
the story of our advantages and prosperity â a
prosperity based upon a development hardly be
gun in comparison with our resources and pos
sibil'ties. -
It Is pleasant to know that the second visit
Is the direct result of the pleasure and Interest
derived from the first by the thousands of com
rades and friends who came hither In 19S6. Our
people then arose to the occasion, and the good
time which marked that notable I national en
campment was the camp-Ore > talk of every
Grand Army post in the country for years aft
erward. More should be the direct consequence
of the. present one. The old veterans. who have
been here before will bring" the children, who
have in the meantime grown up, -and anew
generation will carry back stories of the soil,
climate, productions, commerce and the hospi
tality of our favored section, which will spread
over the face of the territory from Maine to
Florida and from Minnesota to the Gulf.'
Since the Grand Army visited us before many
great things have happened â so many that It
puzzles one to recall them from personal mem
ory, but, in the present connection easily tha
first thought that occurs -la the sad one> tha:
nearly all of the grand old commanders in thÂ»
War of the Rebellion on the Union side who
were here, and with us drank from tha same
loving cup. seventeen years ago. have been re
lieved from earthly command and duty with
the colors and comrades here, and await the re
assembling of the corps In the Great Beyond.
When the old soldiers were here In lSS8.the
assassination. of Cbmrade Garfleld was still a
fresh and bitter memory. Fresher.' and - still
more bitter- to-day, is the recollection that the
brave, good and noble comrade. William MÂ«-
KInley, who led the American people through
the war with Spain and out of ' the bondage of
provincialism Into the glory of their present
natural and International position, only a little
while ago died by the hand of a murderer.
It should be a matter for self-gratuUtion
and pride among Californiaâ¢* that San Fran
cisco twice 3 has been chosen as the meeting
place for national encampments. When It is
remembered that fully three-fourths of :the
membership of the Grand Army, on an average,
reside 2500 miles away from the Golden Gate,
It is. I am sure, a deserved compliment to our
city and Its people that the members of the or
ganization should face the discomforts and ex
pense of a transcontinental Journey in order to
be our ruesta.
The circumstances and conditions attending
the Thirty-seventh National Encampment of the
Grand Army of the Republic In San Francisco
ought to form Interesting: matter for reflection
for all of the people of California. Most of
our grown-up people still remember the first
national Grand Army gathering: at the GoMea
Gate, seventeen . years ago. That was not a
long time ago in the experience of the elders,
yet it has marked radical differences in the po
litical and economic evolution of the country
which have not failed to set their Impress upon
every part of it, and particularly upon our own
section. Of one change, both local and general
In character, no thinking man can â¢ be uncon
scious, and that Is the new Impetus given to
the sentiment of patriotism and veneration of
our flag and pride In the strength and power
of the republic which, in the intervening years,
has arisen from the condition of a political
community, In a measure Isolated from other
great nations, who were Indifferent to our am
bitions and progress, to that of a flrst-clasa
world-power, whose wishes and Interests must
be counted with and wbpse friendship must be
zealously cultivated by every civilized govern
ment of the world.

At the hour mentioned above people
standing on New Montgomery street
around the entrance of the Palace Hotel
were suddenly startled by the sound of
crashing glass, and a second later they
saw various articles of furniture flying
out of a window of a room in the Grand,
which proved to be that occupied by Mrs.
Dahl. Chairs, mattresses, bedclothes,
wearing apparel, toilet articles and even
jewelry followed each other in rapid suc
cession from the open window, much to
the amazement .of a large crowd in the
street- below, and finally the form of a
woman , appeared at the window. She
stood there but a moment, as if scanning
the result of her and then pulled
the sash down and disappeared. ,
Meanwhile some one had notified the
clerk of the Grand of the affair, and a
porter had hurried up to Mrs. Dahl's
room, to which, however, he was denied
an entrance. The porter then entered an
adjoining room, and by climbing out of a
window was . able to reach Mrs. Dahl's
apartment and promptly gained an
entrance. The woman was found quietly
standing In the middle of her room, and
with smiling face she remarked as the
porter entered that she "had been clean
ing up."
Mrs. Dahl for a time appeared to be
perfectly rational, but later, when taken
to the new City Hall, sho became bois
terous and had to be locked in a cell,
where she will remain until to-morrow
under" observation. She is about 35 years
of age and a woman of attractive ap
pearance.
Mrs. Annie' Dahl, wife of Charles Dahl,
a foreman of the United Railroads, whose
home is at 43S Madrid street, created con
siderable excitement at the Grand Hotel
last evening shortly before 7 o'clock.
Three days ago the woman registered at
the hotel and was assigned to a room on
the second floor, overlooking Stevenson
street. Later a trunk, a sewing machine
and several other articles belonging to
her'>were received at the hotel and moved
to her room, where she remained quietly
until last evening.

SARATOGA, Aug. 8.â The general opin
ion of the ablest trainers at the v track
to-day at the conclusion of the racing
was that the steeplechase was the only
true run race. All of the others, say
these experts, were won by horses able
by superior early speed to get "in the
"path" which for two days has played
bo important a part in the' results. This
was notably the case in the Saratoga
special, the Travers stake and the fifth
race, the winners of all three of these
races having j been ridden by O'Neill,
whose excellent handling of the mounts
intrusted to his care has earned the
warmest commendation from men whose
opinions count for much.
In each instance O'Neill raced for the
"path," which extended about two and
a half feet from the inside rail, and while
Aristocracy. Ada Nay and The I^ady Ro
hesia. In their respective races, were gal
loping freely and to the full extent of
their stride* their opponents were com
pelled to stay in the heavy going which
prevailed all over the track except for
the narrow space mentioned. That ther>
should exist such/ a thing as a "path"
in the month of August on a New York
racecourse Is at once a wonder and a
source of dissatisfaction to trainers. Thia
Ktat(Â« of affairs cannot now be
helped and the only hope for really good
sport is that the elements will combine
to~rcmove all ill elfe#<s>.
Two prominent racing men -engaged ir
an argument as to the respective merits
of The Lady Rohesia and Sailor Knot
and an offer of J3000 was made to match
Sailor Knot and The Lady Rohosia. not
withstanding the fact that thÂ© latter had
won, the argument of the admirer of
Sailor Knot being that he- had no chance
because he was forced to run in the
heavy going, while The Lady Kohesia
was on tne "nath."

slmxnons packed up his belongings after
tbÂ« lunch hour on Friday and with Mrs.
Fiusimxnons left for Callstoga In a pri
vate conveyance soon after the arrival of
tbe stage. Their supposed sudden de
parture set the gossips of Mlddletown all
agog.
Quite a number from town attended the
benefit performance here the night before,
p.nd putting two and two together figured
that Jim Jeffries had buffeted Fitzslm
raons about too much In their bout and
that a rupture in the training camp had
occurred. Their Tears, however, were
prounflles?. There ha* been no friction.
Hob started for San Francisco a day

was nothing further for him to do, and
his pretty wife had tired of country life.

Manager Delaney -is perfectly satisfied

him to indulge in as MtUe exercise as

The Angels won th'elr game yesterday
at Recreation Park about as easily as ball
games are generally to be had. It was
through no brilliant efforts on their part
that tho tiao of. battle turned from the
Cripples' camp, but rather tho many and
costly mistakes the tailenders were wont
to commit whenever an Angel rested on
the bags. Score, 5 to 3.
Lee was in pood form and should have
won. He would easily have made an even
break with Dolly Gray had his backers
treated him with any degree of respect or
consideration. He was not hit to any ex
tent, the Angels only Becuringr five scat
tered safeties throughout the nine innings
of action.
The Cripples opened the game by slap
vfing Gray"fi offerings to all the four cor
ners of the lot. They were delighted to
face the big southpaw, and showed their
appreciation by slamming that ball as it
has not bieen hit during the opening in
ning In many weeks.
O'Hara. tho first man up, received a
pass. He was clow in his movements, and
was forced at second by Francks. The
latter, when he reached the bag. did not
wait long, for Murdock'a hit cent him
around to third. A few moments later
Schwartz's timely. one chased him home.
Then Moose 6axter was right there with
a double and Murdock registered. It
might have been a dozen, only Kruger
was unfortunate enough to hit a liner into
"Wheeler's mitts and a double play stoppW
any more action on the part of the Crip
ples. â¢ ' v '
It was a long wait for the Angels, but
they finally tied up the result in the fifth.
Ross hit And stole and arrived at the pan
when Francks allowed Toman's grounder
to go through him. Spies out. placed
Toman over the last jump and the score
was tied. -
The Angels landed one more in the next
inning on a hit and a baÂ»e on balls. In
the eighth they simply broke up all the
fun by sending two more of their num
ber home on a hit and an error or so
that the Crlpplrs were pood enough lo
mak". Two lucky hits and an out in the
ninth let the Cripples g?t another run,
though It did them but little good. The
score:

MARIN CRICKETERS WIN
IN GOLDEN GATE PARK
LJght work waa all that James J. Cor
bett performed yesterday at his training
quarters at Croll's Gardens, Alameda. In
the morning the ex-champion mixed with
the small punching bag for five, rapid
rounds, during which he moved around
the flying sphere like a dancing dervish.
Jim was here and there almost as
fast as a moving picture, and never ap
peared to tire from the lively pace he set.
He perspired easily and announced that
he did not believe he could possibly feel
In better health.
After leaving the light punching bag
Oorbett tackled thÂ« heavy swinging bag,
filled with wheat, ahd wrestled with it for
three fierce rounds. Then he " skipped
around his gymnasium in a shadow box
ing stunt, knocking out imaginary cham
pions with every wallop. that cleaved the
atmosphere. In the afternoon the big
pugilist lounged about In the open air and
took matters easy. He weighed 186
pounds, the bulk he expects to carry with
him Into the ring when he clashes with
James J. Jeffries.
Corbett and Tommy Ryan, who is one
of the ex-champion's advisers at his
camp, have not yet put on the gloves in a
promised bout. Ryan does not feel equal
to the occasion. Just to try himself yes
terday he donned the mitts with Sam
Berger for three rounds.; The kingpin
middle-weight enjoyed his go with Cor
bett's sparring partner, and also surprised
those who had never seeri. him .perform.
To-morrow Corbett : will go on -the road
in the morning. He does not Intend do
any work in the afternoon.
Announces He Feels He Could Not
Improve on His Present Condition.
CORBETT DOES LIGHT WORK.

from Toah, with"- Bragg third. Respess'
colt broke flying, and before he reached
the quarter-pole he was four lengths in
front and everything behind him 'was
dizzy. Dick^ .-Welles --was as good as
even monpy when betting was to be had,
but at post time he was 3 to; 6. The
sixth and seventh raccÂ» were declared
off. Summary:
CHICAGO, Aug. 8.â Every sign of
betting, o^e of the chief attractions of a
racetrack, was entirely absent at the
Harlem course to-day. Although the
expected raid on the betting ring did
not ocQur, there were said to be more
than 200 deputies- inside the inclosure.
and the management of the track took
no chances. Early comers saw scores of
workmen cleaning out the betting ring,
for the mandate had gone forth from
John Condon, owner of the place, that
no betting would be allowed oh account
of the threatened raid by Harlem vil
lage authorities. One of the biggest
crowds that ever passed the gates At
Harlem was there with loads of .money,
but none would.be accepted.
The odds that would have been laid
had the betting been open were given
out to the newspapers and telegraph
companies to accommodate those who
were able to bet downtown. Some
wager* on the "pike" order were made
between one or two horsemen or guests,
but betting publicly was not allowed. â¢.

CHRONIC SORES
j ., Signs of Polluted Blood.
There is nothing so repulsive looking and disgusting as an old sore.
You worry over it till the brain grows weary and work with it until the
patience is exhausted, and the very sight of the old festering, sickly looking
place "makes you irritable, despondent and desperate.
A chronic sore is the very best evidence that you r blood is inr'an unhealthy
and impoverished condition, that your constitution is breaking down under
the effects of some serious disorder. The taking of strong medicines, like
mercury or potash, will sometimes so pollute and vitiate the blood and im-
pair the general system that the merest scratch or. bruise results in obstinate
non-healing sores of the most offensive character.
Often an inherited taint breaks out in frightful eating sores upon the limbs
or face in old age or middle life. Whenever a sore refuses to heal the blood
is. always at fault, and, while antiseptic washes, salves, soaps and powders
can do much to keep. down the inflammation and cleanse the sore, it will
never heal permanently till the blood itself has been purified and the deadly
germs and poisons destroyed, and with S. S. S. this can be accomplishedâ the
i-Â±- >>*Â¦**% polluted blood is purified and invigorated, and when
|^*^ fC*^ fg^ rich.purebloodiaagaincirculatingfreely throughout
AJi^V A^^V'\s^Vthe body the flesh around the old sore begins to take
KJM Km)) KÂ»jyJ on a natural color, the discharge of matter ceases r
v^*"^ â and the place heals over. ? '
! S. S. S. is.bbth a blood purifier and tonic that puts your blood in order
and at the same time tones up the system and builds up the general health. ,
If you have a chronic sore write us. No charge'for medical advice.

Among tho many great horses developed
on this farm Palo Alto was ono of tho
most famous. During his lifetime he
trotted to the world's record of 2:13% and
held tho world's record for a high wheeled
sulky of 2:08?i. After his death Sunol,
one of tho Stanford horses, lowered this
to 2:08V4- The skeletons of Electioneer,
Palo Alto and Occident are to be seen in
the Stanford University museum. There
is also in the museum a hlgn-wheeled
sulky which was never used for any other
horse but Occident, who usually was
driven by Governor Stanford himself. In
this sulky Occident made a mile in 2:18%.
This horse later trotted in 2:16% and bo
came tho champion trotting gelding in the
world. Another very interesting relic In
tho museum, which now contains prac
tically all there is left of tho farm. Is the
sulky weighing forty-threo pounds. In
which Bell Bird made the world's yearling
record of 2:26 1 ,i, Arion tho world's two
year-old record of 2:10*4, Palo Alto tho
world's stallion record of 2:08%, and Sunol
tho world's record of 2:08%. Some of tho
other great horses that wero reared hero
were Elaine, St. Julian, Fred Crocker,
Kentucky, St. Bel, Raris, Electricity, Nor
laine and Norval.
The authorities of the university have
not yet decided to what use they will put
the largo grounds and numerous buildings
of the great breeding and racing estab
lishment that now no longer exists.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Auff. 8.â
The famous Palo Alto stock farm, which
was founded thirty years ago by Senator
Stanford, was practically - closed to-day.
The positions of tho superintendent and
his assistants have lapsed and no more
breeding or other work will take place
upon tho farm from now on. TherÂ© aro
still 160 horses which havo to be kept
until next fall and a few men will be re
tained to care for them until that time.
Superintendent Covey haa not as yet de
cided on his plans for the future. .
Senator Stanford founded and kept up
this great institution for many years at
great expense and the marvelous success
which ho gained in breeding blooded stock
ia a matter of history. Ho built magnifi
cent barns, stables, paddocks and raco
tracks covering many acres, and had hun
dreds of horses, all the time. There wero
two farms, one on the border between
San Mateo and Santa Clara counties for
trotters, and another near Mayfleld which
was a running farm. The world-wido
fame of these farms grew from year to
year up to tho time of his death in 1893.
Since then Mrs. Stanford has kept up tho
trotting farm, which was tho main one,
on a somewhat smaller scale in memory
of him. Large numbers of fine horses
have been bred and trained, but no racing
has been engaged in. For some time past,
howevor, it has seemed advisable to close
the farm, and to this end the superin
tendent has been shipping large consign
ments of horses to the East at regular
intervals, where they, havo brought very
high prices. , "J-'i'i
' As long as men are Interested in horses
and harness racing the feats accomplished
at the Palo Alto farm and tho marvelous
speed developed by the horses raised there
will always bo remembered. It was there
that Electioneer was bred, undoubtedly
one of the greatest horses that ever lived,
and a granite monument now.. stands
above his grave. He was the greatest
producer of extreme speed the world has
ever seen, more than 1100 horses in tho
2:30 fist having sprung from him. His
sons and daughters held the "world's rec
ords for yearlings, two, three, four and
five-year-olds, and for mares and stal
lions.

Ir.to a eea which to shore folk would
have seemed wildly angry Williams was
lowered by his 6h!pmates. His task was
to dive beneath the surface and secure
f_ ehackle to the lower outside edge of
the rudder. This done, he made fast
Etout wire ropes to 4 the shackle; these
ropes were spliced to the tackle above,
and the Homeward Bound's rudder â¢was
once more in commission.
To do all this Williams had to dive
Fome twenty times. The water was ter
ribly cold and his Fpells were necessarily
brief, but ho stayed with the. 'work until
the submarine part of * it was completed,
which was in about two hours. When
!:sulod on deck he was thoroughly played
out. but after a few hours' rept he had
r.lrcost forgotten the ordeal through which
hp had gone.
So well did the Jury rudder work that
<!*cptaJn Thompson yesterday refused the
services of a tug and reached Quarantine

Th* Homeward Bound called' at Easter
Island. Mate Williams went ashore and
'"overnor Cooper visited thÂ© chip, taking
with him a liberal eupply of fruits and
firsh meat. Easter Island Is about 2300
miles west of Chile ar.d Is tho easternmost
ir;h'ab!ted Polynesian island. It'is famous
for its ancient gigantic statues. The
Homeward Bound was 172 days coming
from Antwerp and brought a general car

Otto Gildemeister, which arrived here two
yrars ago under a jury rig and after one
Of the longest passages on record.
The work of rigging tho Jury rudder
was simple enough as far as the spar ana
the tackle were concerned, but making
fast the tackle to the rudder at a point
several feet under water was a different
proposition, and Involved skill, nerve and
*r.durance In proportions seldom combined
in one man. In Mate Williams of the
Homeward Bound, howevar, was found
the material for the hazardous task. It

on the public stage would make Blondin's

fulness of the Yankee skipper and tho
pluck of tho American sallorman. In a
terrific sale off Cape Horn the Homeward
Bound's rudder stock was carried away,
and for some hours the bis bark floun
dered helplessly in the sea, the toy of
the wind, which in fierce blasts stripped
the helpless vessel of many sails. When
the- schooner Otella Pedcrson had her rud
der disabled In the China Sea. some
months ago captain and crew abandoned
her in spite of the fact that the vessel
was lumber-laden and not very far from
port. Captain Thompson and tho men
that manned the Homeward Bound were
made of sterner stuff, however, and as a
rpsult their floating home is safe in the
harbor.
The Homeward Bound's rudder stcok
carried away May 31 In latitude 57 12
south, longitude 77 west, off Cape Horn,
where the waves never rest and where
the water is icy cold. As soon, as the fury
<-f the g-ale moderated Captain Thompson
started to repair the damage/ and within
half a day the Homeward Bound,
equipped with as fine & jury rudder as
steered a ship, was on her way to
&in Francisco.
A stout spar was lashed In place across
the poop and projecting- a number of feet
on either side. The tackle for operating
the rudder was passed through blocks at
tho extremetics of this spar and around
thÂ© drum in the wheelhouse, and when
completed one man was able to steer the
thip with the regular wheel.

Here's a toast, let all drink deep
To the alpenkoenig In his retreat.
And a tear for thÂ« other kings and queens,'
Who think they know it all, when they don't
know beane.
It rarely is a touching sight
To see a noble appetite.
And minstrels long the praise will sine
Of Governor Wells, the bohnenking;
But now, good friends, you all will rtÂ»e
While we beatow tfce second prize
On the real winner of the feat.
Who cooked the bean
By my faith Is a queen.
So a krauz to koenlgln Haesters.

About 1000 skilled glass cutters In twen

is done by the piece at prices which give
the average wage 45 cents a day. The
skill of these famous Bohemian glass cut

trained to it from the age *of six years.
Much of the work is done in homes with

wrought- such fearful havoc, but sufficiently
severe to interfere .with .the. pearl Industry.
Tahiti itself Is free from these ' storms. Â¦ The
Mariposa brought the largest cargo she has
ever carried from* Papeete. It Included 50,000

The tax bills are now being made out
In Tax Collector. Smith's office, prepara
tory to collecting the taxes next October.
On Thursday 4721 bills were made out, be
ing an average of 167 for. each, man en
gaged on the work. On Tuesday 5993 bills
were figured, an average of 199. The office
is at a disadvantage, owing to the fact
that the Board of Equalization is likely
to raise the assessment of San Francisco.
On that account the valutlon Is left off

Wong Ping, the hotel reporter of the Chi
nese Dally News of this city, assisted an Ori
ental friend yesterday to carry his baggage
on board the liner. Siberia. "Wong bowed his
friend arood-by and would have come ashore,
but a Chinese Bureau official spotted, him and
ordered him to remain on board. Ping is a
native son, but he had to send for his lawyer
and a score of Chinese friends before he was
allowed to land, and even then was takon to
the detention shed Â¦ and held until he proved
beyond a doubt his right to be in free Amer
ica. While the bureau officials were holding
Ping on the Siberia the Chineso in the deten
tion-shed were taking notes of an evidently
extremely interesting message being delivered
to them by a strong-lunged Chinese from the
top of a lumber pile about a block from the
Mall dock. The customs officials , have no
longer anything to do with the enforcement of
the exclusion act and the Chinese seem to have
found quite a difference. Communication be
tween the detained and local residents has al
ways be-an prevented as far as possible. Under
tho old order there were always enough cus
toms officers In the vicinity of Hotel Mon
golia to make communication difficult. For
the last few days, however, the man on the
lumber pile has been making the most of the
open window, and whatever his loud oration
meant It was of enough 'Interest to those in
the detention shed for them to make careful
and apparently voluminous notes.

The Board of Education " received a
communication yesterday from the Board
of Public "Works statin? that the contract
for the heating and ventilating plant In
the Noe Valley School had been awarded
to R. Dalzell & Co., the lowest bidder,
for $5779. This Is the first Intimation the
School Board has received regarding the
cost of the plant. The neglect of the
Board of Works has caused the School
Board to withhold approval of the con
tract, as was published in The Call re
cently.
President Woodward of the School
Board Is much Incensed at the fact that
no estimate of cost for the plant had
been heretofore submitted . to that body,
as provided by law. The board . is not
satisfied with the explanation and has
already notified the contractor that he
will not be allowed to enter the Noe
Valley School building to install the plant.
In explanation of its failure to submit
an estimate of cost to the School Board
the Board of Public Works states in its
letter that there were so many different
plans of heating that it . was . Impossible
to make estimates of cost, as it was nbt
known which would be accepted. The
letter further states that, though the
award has been made, no formal contract
for the performance of the work will be
entered into until the School Board ap
proves the award.

dall, a prominent fruit grower, who has
Just returned from a trip to Europe, re-
ported there was a big shortage in the
prune crop of the Old World. He said
the Santa Clara prune growers should be
able to maiket their crop this year on a
3% cents basis. He advised them to stand
together, and they would get this price.
We wish we were still of the age when
we were not expected to do anything but
grow and say "Please" and "Thank you."

To the Citizens of San Francisco and Vicinity
â The Legislature of California officially In
vited the Grand Army of the Republic to hold
its Thirty-seventh National Encampment in this
city., The Mayor and Supervisors added their
invitation on behalf of San Francisco. The
commercial organizations of the city joined in
promoting the selection of San Francisco as the
meeting place. All elements of society within
our State were eager to secure the encampment
for our Pacific Count : metropolis. Now It is
found that the liberality which formerly marked
the actions of our merchant princes and others,
when conventions of fraternal and religious or
ganizations were in question, has not been man
ifested In this Instance. Is this right? <
Does not every patriotic and material consid
eration demand that this gathering of the old
Union Â»oldiers of the. war for. the preservation
of the Union shall be distinguished by a wel
come, the cost of .which ought to . be a minor
consideration? V . . ""
Tho executive committee In charge of the en
tertainment of the Grand Army comrades and
other thousands who will visit the city 'within
a few days is short of money. The committee
is confident that it is only necessary to call thÂ«
attention of our generous people to this condi
tion In order to tecure the required funda to
carry out the programme of entertainment.
Never again will that grand patriotic*- organi
zation assemble . In our, midst. The coming
meeting will" be the last occasion whereby our
citizens will be able to show, special honor to
the fast disappearing defenders of our country.

This was the second operation of the
kind that Mr. English has undergone,
which makes the result more uncertain.
The operation was conducted by Dr. D. D.
Crowley, Dr. Frank L. Adama and Dr.
Edward J. Rice, and proved to be a most
difficult one. At the first operation the
appendix had not been secured and It
was decided to-day that it would not be
wise to tax the patient's strength too
much, and the appendix was not searched
for too closely. A very large abcees was
found, and when this had been removed
it was decided to allow the patient to
recover without further use of the knife.
The condition of Mr. English to-night
was said to-be much better than was ex
pected, though exceedingly grave. His
temperature was very little above normal,
and his pulse, though high, was strong:
Dr, Crowley said that he considered the
patient's condition very good, but that it
would be two or three days before any
thing definite could be said as to recov
ery.

Mooney was seen to-day, but refused
to make any statement. He has been
asked by the director of the bureau of
ethnology to prepare an official state
ment, which is now being done, and
Mooney paid that he was prepared to
make affidavit to everything his
utterance would contain.
White's version of the dragging of the
head of the cow from the shoulders, the
cow's head . taking the place of
the buffalo head of bygone days,
was that the Indian started * on a
run around the camp, hotly pur
sued by Seger, who could not catch
the fed man, and when he did get near
to him could not tell who It was. because
the fleeing fanaXic was eo bedecked with
feethcrs as to be unrecognisable. He fur
ther declared that the sticks were torn
cut of the shoulders and that the sticks,
lariat and pieces of flesh were bought by
Mooney and Dorsey.
The substance of White's allegation is
that upoh the payment of $15, one Indian
was persuaded to run around the camp,
dragging behind him a cow's head at the
end of a lariat which was attached to two
sticks driven through the flesh of hiB
rhoulder, and that one other Indian
worked a rope through the flesh of his
breast and attempted to have himself sus
pended by the rope, according to the an
cient custom, but that the flesh tore away
un&f.r the strain.

Special Dispatch to The Call
It is believed 'that the principal terms
which ' the executive â¢ committee desire
embodied in the ordinance will be con
ceded by the Southern Pacific. Manager
Julius Krutschnitt was Informed to-day
by Major C. L. Tilden, chairman 6f the
committee of fifty, that the change in the
committee's plan of proceeding in the ne
gotiations would make the conference
set for next Monday unnecessary. It Is
expected that the next conference of the
commltteemen and the Southern Pacific
people will be held in Alameda, and the
City Trustees will Join with the commit
tee In the meeting.
Have the City Attorney frame an ordinance
embracing the provisiona demanded of the
Southern Pacific by the executive committee.
These are for twenty-five year franchises; pay
ment to the city monthly of ?500; a 2*4-cent
fare within the city limits; maintenance of
the local train service up to the present stand
ard; together wl|h other stipulations of lesser
importance as aÂ«reed upon. Thla ordinance
is then to be Introduced at the regular session
of the City Trustees on the night of the 17th
inst. and a copy of the same forwarded to
the Southern Pacific management. The of
ficials of the company can then arrange a
conference with the committee of fifty or the
executive committee of that body or with the
City Trustees, as it sees fit. After the or
dinance i is introduced it may be amended in
any way that both sides agree on and It Is
thought it will be ready for passage by the
City Trustees on September 7.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 8.â As a result of con
ferences with the City Trustees, the exec
utive committee of- the citizens' advisory
committee of fifty, chosen by the muni
cipal governing 1 body, has, upon the sug
gestion of President J. F. Forderer of the
City Trustees, decided to take a new
course In its negotiations with the South
ern Pacific management relative to the
local franchises in order to arrive at def
inite results sooner.
It was first proposed that the executive
committee meet with the railroad officials,
report back to the general committee of
fifty the result of its conferences and
continue along this line until negotiations
were concluded and action taken on the
applications for the franchises by the City
Trustees. Now it is planned to have the
executive committee submit a plan of
procedure to the committee of fifty Mon
day night, and if it is approved, to go
ahead in the following manner:
YOSEMITE VALLEY. Aug. 8.â Tx> the
Yosemite Valley in automobiles will
be possible in the near future. Tired
horses and dusty roads are to give place
to gasoline motors and well tiled roads.
D. T. Ray of San Francisco arrived here
to-day in the interests of the Yosemite
Stage and Turnpike Company and of the
Southern Pacific Company to report upon
the feasibility of the change contemplat
ed by the two companies. He has ex
amined the grades between here and Ray
mond and says that the sixty-nve-mile
ride can be made with more comfort as
well as quicker in an automobile than in
enÂ© of the old time stages. The ride will
also be made with a greater degree of
safety, for the cars will be equipped with
powerful brakes and there will be no
horses to become frightened at objects
along the. route.
Ray proposes to use twelve-passenger
cars equipped with powerful gasoline en
gines and states that not more than ten
gallons of gasoline will be used in mak
ing the trip from Raymond to the Yo
eemlte. This will mean a big saving in
money to the stage company, which now
uses thirty-two horses for each stage over
the same length of travel and at an ex
pense of fl for each horse.
Between forty and fifty nickel and sil
ver watches were taken from the Jewelry
store-of A. A. Handle in the postofQce
block some time last night. The bur

door. This enabled him to insert his
hand and turn the key that locked the
door. Besides tha large number of
watches the burglar got away with a
case of spectacles and lenses worth J1S4.
An investigation of the premises this
morning showed that an attempt had
been made to open the large safe of
Cheney & Berry In the same office. The
combination lock had been tampered with,
but the efforts to open the safe- were un
availing. Handle is now congratulating
himself that he lost none of the valuable
watches belonging to his patrons. These
were locked in a safe that was not touch

all of ordinary grade and many of them
did not have any works. . .

The following matches were played
In singles Ray Cornell and Normkn
Hodgkinson played an interesting match.
The crack professional proved too strong
for his amateur opponent,, who finally
won a set after losing three. Cornell
could make but little headway against
the swift strokes of Hodgkinson.
Dr. McChesney maintained his winning
streak and beat Harry Butler two sets.
Butler, who Is a Canadian player, joined
the club recently. He has a good style
and his strokes are clean, ire will sure
ly be heard from.. . .
; The matches contained much more class
i # than usual, and the majority of' them
'were close and exciting.
! The best match was that between Sher
i wood Adams and G. D. Russell, ; the cx
j champion of Michigan, and Dr. H. P.
: Hill and Charles Kuehn. Russell showed
a lack of practice, but his side won three
out of the four sets played.
Homer Parker and Frank Strmgham
took two close sets from Sidney Salisbury
and Henry Rolfe. The losers played a
spectacular driving game, but String
ham's sure < chop strokes proved effec
tive against* his hard hitting opponents.
Stringham and Salisbury joined â¢ forces
and beat Parker and Henry Mills two
sets.
The wind and fog: did not deter the ten
nis players yesterday afternoon, when the
largest crowd in many weeks was pres
ent on the club and public courts. So
numerous were the players at the Cali
fornia Club courts that in most cases it
became necessary for them to double up
in order that all might be accommodated.
Lawrence avers In his petition that hÂ«
is illegally held and makes the plea that
Gertrude Stephens testified at his prelim
inary hearing that "she loaned the money
upon future events, to-wit: marriage at
seme future, undetermined date, and the
Investment of the money In. business at
some future time."
Miss Stephens says Lawrence inveigled
her into loaning him money under the
impression that she was getting a. hus
band. She Bays she let him have the
money to Invest and that he promised
to marry her. As he neither made tha
Investment nor wedded her she had him
arrested for obtaining money under false
pretenses.
Attorney A. F. St. Bure 1 applied to Su
perior Judge Ellsworth to-day for a writ
of habeas corpus for the release of
Charles Lawrence, now confined In the
Broadway Jail in- San Francisco on a
charge of obtaining money by false pre
tenses preferred by Miss Gertrude Steph
ens. Lawrence will be brought to A^j

THE CIVIL WAD IN
PICTORIAL MNORAMA
IN all the gamut of human emotions there is nothing that stirs the
inmost soul of man like the clash of war. Civilization may cul-
tivate lamblike virtues, but it does not eradicate the instinct for the
heroic and the ferocious. In music it is the crashing martial strain that
makes the stronEestiappeal to the greatest number. In mythology the
greatest warriors are given most reverence. In history the battle cry
ever sounds the loudest. mos;t sensuous note; while in art i^ is the wild
scenes of blood and carnaKe--of daredevil attack and desperate defenseâ
in the awful shock of contending forces that rouses all the passions to
fever heat. And thus it is that around the spirit that will do and die for
a principle the tendcresfc sentiments ever cling. And thus it is, top,
that the coming Encampment- of the Grand Army of the Republic in
our city. stands as the symbol of all America's present grandeur.
To those whose names make up it3 roll of honor that stupendous
struggle must ever be a vivid reality, but to those of the younger gen-
eration the hope and despair of that fierce conflict must be sÂ«en through
the eyes of the artist and the painter. And it is a remarkable fact that
some of the best battle scenes ever painted are those depicting our great
Civil War from beginning to end.
It is this fact that has enabled The Sunday Call in its* special
G. A. R. Edition next Sunday to present its readers with the best pic-
torial panorama of fiercest battles of the war that can be offered by a
modern newspaper. Beginning with General Grant's victory at Fort
Donelson, these pictures carry you through the entire war to its spec-
tacular close with the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox, which
scene alone, replete as it is with historical characters, is one of the most
n6table pictures ever reproduced on a modern color press. There is
"The Battle of Shiloh." "Chattanooga," "The Siege of Vicksburg."
"Sherman's March to the Sea." "The Battle of Gettysburg," "Grant's Ca-
reer From West Point to Appomattox," etc.
And in the line of fiction the greatest popularity has ever been given
to tales of love and war. Just think what themes the Civil War had to
offer 1 And what sentiment, too! There is "Forty Years After" in the
next Sunday Call, for instance. It is a story of the wavering tide of
battle at Vicksburg. with a thrillingly "pathetic denouement in this citv.
Then there 13 "A Girl of the South," "Fate's Pence." "A War Vision"
and "Trying Him Out." which latter will bring back the most stirring
memories to any one who knows anything about war.
And in a different way. how many know anything about the
speeches that created that awful slaughter. There are two .pages of fervid
eloquence that will, simply amaze you , who read them now, so many
years after. " Â£8*9
And even more strangely appealing are the two pages of anecdotes
from the hospital, the bivouac and the battlefield told by women, who
consecrated their lives to nursing. It is warâ actual war â from the
point of view of over fifty of these ministering angels.
And last but not least, there is that magnificent Supplement â tender
sentiment crystallized into color â "The Old Army Chest." wherein a
hardy warrior of the rebellion is showing his treasures to his beautiful
.fair-haired daughter. Just register a deep- voiced complaint with vour
carrier if you do not get this picture with your G. A. R. Edition of the
next Sunday Call. .,..,.... . .Dried Fruits,Nuts,Raisiiis,Honey.
An Improvement -in the export demand
higher Liverpool markets and a continued small
movement were bullish Influences which caused
a strong opening in wheat. There was & good
demand from commission houses and local
traders at the start,, principally for the Sep.
tember delivery,, and that month opened U@Â£a
higher at .79%Â®79%c. Some , scattered liqui
dation during the first few minutes caused Â¦ a
slightly easier feeling when September sold off
to 79Uc, but when the selling had ceased the
market quickly regained all the loss and prices
continued to advance as the session nrns-rauad.

COFFEE â C. E. Blckford'n circular says:
"Market has been extremely quiet and at pres
ent writing continues dull and heavy, dealers
being little disposed to buy in excess of tem
porary requirements. Stocks in importers'
hands are large, but an arrivals for the season
are practically over, will decrease rapidly from
now on. 8trlctly superior grades of washed
Coffees are exhausted, fair to prime are still
In good supply, but not more. The assortment
is overloaded with ash-damaged and nonde
scripts, mainly Guatemala?. Large quantities
of mild Coffees are now coming forward to
New York from Venezuela and United States
of Colombia, and heavy receipt* from those
quarters are expected for come months to
come. Quotations In New York fcr these have
declined quite sharply of late and has direct
bearing upon the product of Central America.
The position of Brazilians has weakened a
trifle during the past month, both as to spot
Coffee and futures, and is generally regarded
as not promising any improvement under ex
isting- conditions and crop prospects as now es
timated. At the close to-day, however, futures
improved 5 to 15 points under heavy specula
tive buying of the distant positions. Spot Cof
fee unchanged. Receipts at the ports of Brazil
so far are slightly In excess of last year's. To
day's first hand stock consists of 10, SM bass

Washington Crop Bulletin.
The repcrt of G. N. Salisbury. Section Direc
tor, U. 8. Weather Bureau, for the Washing
ton Crop Bulletin, week ended August 4, is as
: ollows :
The week was unusually cool throughout, for
the time of year, and was without rain, except
light showers on the 30th and 31st in the cen
tral and northeast counties.
There was not the ucual amount of sunshine
lor cummer weather, and, therefore, lt was not
a very Javcrable week for making hay. That
?mployiuent is now, for the most part, fin
ished. A -air average crop, and In tome lo
calities, a heavy crop, ha^ been secured, in
cood condition, in the section of the State wÂ«=t
<f the Cascades. In the eastern section the
1 rop of timothy has been rather licht. The
Â»eccnd cutting of alfalfa i!> now in the stack,
cad is considered a eood yield.
The weather has been very favorable for har
\ eating- and threehlng winter wheat. Reports
us to the yield are very conflicting. Eome say
I he yield is more than was expected ; others
Ipes. Much depends on the locality, and how '
the land vu prepared, but there can be no j
<ioubt that the yield Is much below the average. ,
except In the beit j>ertÂ£ of Walla Walla and
Spokane ceur.ties. The quality Is {rood, with a
Sirm, plump berry, although the straw Is un
usually short. The weather lias been Just right
for the flUIng of fprtag wheat, which Is now \
approaching maturity. The crop in most dis
tricts will be light, but the quality good. There
is a pood deal of wild oats and -weeds in it.
In Lincoln County harvest is la progress. The
> iHd will not be up to expectations there. In
Spokene County the fall wheat harvest Is about
<<\er. Cora, melons and cucumbers have done
v.r'i in that county. Potatoes. In general over
thÂ«- State, ere a fine crcp this year. Pastures
are beginning to show the effect of dry weather.

DRESSED MEATS.
Meat Market.
The required reserve was Increased $603,700
through the augmented deposits; adding this
sum to the loss of cash makes a decrease of
$2,473,000 In surplus reserve to $21,587,075.
Calculated upon the basis of deposit* less
those of $37,249,900 of public funds, the sur
plus reserve is $30,910,800.
NEW TORK, Aug. 8.â The statement of
averages of the clearing-house banks of this
city for the week shows: Loans $012,697,100,
increase $3,832,Â«IO; deposits $912,976,500. in

000; ex-United States deposits $30,910,800 de
crease $2,460,625.
The Financier says: The striking feature
of the statement of the associated banks last
Â¦seek was the increasÂ« of $3,382,600 In loans.
This was entirely contrary to expectations, a
decrease being confidently looked for, as In
deed, it has been for the last three weeks*.
es the result of liquidation In the stock market
and the consequent cancellation of bank loans.
It appears probable, however, that the reason
which was assigned in the bank statement
analysis of the previous week for the failure
of the loan Item to reflect t!ie stock liquida
tion was correct and that the otherwise un
accounted for changes in this ltfttn were due
to j-eloaning of money released by the. can
cellation of collateral loans and also that loan
ing by thÂ» banks at call hÂ»* larrely Increased
because of the absentation by the trust com
panies from such loans In consequence of the.
prevailing low rates for money, these com
panies being Indisposed to disturb their de
fOEitB with banks, upon which depcFits they
probably realize a better average return, in
th* form of interest, than could be obtained
were they to loon their bank deposit? on the
market. The net cash reserve was decrease-i
fl.S39.300. The deposits were increased $2 -
414.000.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
During the latter part of the session there was
considerable buying on prospects of a bullish
Government crop report Monday and on the
strength of the outside markets, and with light
offerings September advanced to 80%c, but
eased off. later, closing at Â£0%c, a gain of %c
for the day.
Trading in corn was rather quiet, and the
market ruled steady throughout thâ¬ day, local
bulls and some of the larger commission houses
being good buyers of the May dejlvery, and the
selling was moBtly by longs. After selling be
tween 62 %c and 52 He. September closed %c
hUrher at 52%c.
Oats ruled fairly strong, with moderate ad
vances in all months. The close was firm, with
September. ] /Â»Â©tfe higher at 34%@34%c.
Provisions experienced better support than
for some time past and a firm tone prevailed.
Small receipts of hogs and better prices at the
yards were early bull factors, and with the fair
demand from brokers, prices were well main
tained. September pork closed 5c higher, Sep
tember lard was up 10c and ribs were 5c
higher.

demand only narrow. Weather west is cool,
and warm wet weather is needed. The Gov
ernment report is in doubt, but it can hardly
show a very high condition and may be quite
bullish. With the present crop outlook, even
though thÂ« price is high, we don't see how
auy decline is likely to take place."

THE CENTER OF THE WORLD. .
"Where fs the center of the world?"
This is the question Jupiter was asked aa
he sat in his golden hall. Of course the mighty
ruler of the earth and Bky was too wise to be
puzzled by so simple a question, but he was
too busy to answer It at once. So he said:
"Come again In one year from to-day and I
will show you the very place."
Then Jupiter took two swift eagles which
could fly faster than the storm wind and
trained them till the speed of the one was the
same as that of the other.
- At the end of the year he said to his ser-
vants :
"Take this eagle to the eastern rim of the
earth, where the sun rises out of the sea, and
carry his fellow to the far west, where the
ocean Is lost in darkness and nothing lies be-
yond. Then when I give you the sign loosen
both at the same moment."
The servants did as they were bidden and
carried the eagles to the outermost edges of the
world.
Then Jupiter clapped his hands. The light-
ning flashed, the thunder rolled and the two
birds were set free.
One oJlthem flew straight back toward the
West arjfl the other flew straight back toward
the East; and no arrow ever sped faster from
the bow than did these two birds from the
hands of those who bad held them.
On and on they went like shooting stars,
rushing to meet each other, and Jupiter and
al! his mighty company sat amid the clouds
and watched their tlicht.
Nearer and nearer they came, but they
swerved not to the right nor to the left.
Nearer and nearer, and then with a crash
like the meeting of two ships at sea the eagles
came together in mid air and fell dead to the
ground.
"Who asked where is the center of the
world?"- Bald Jupiter. "The spot where the
eagles lie, that is the center of the world."
They had fallen upon the slope of a beautiful
hill, which Is now called
PARNASSUS HEIGHT8.
"If that is the center of the world," said
young Apollo, "then I will make my home
there, and I will build a house ia that place
so that my light may be seen In all lands."
Visitors to Parnassus Heights are
Invited to inspect the home of Apollo,
corner of H street and Seventh ave-

The English club women take it for granted that they can get education else
where, so intellectual improvement in the wav of lectures and literary meetings

hotels by women whose homes are more or less Inaccessible, and who by Joln

who belong to th3 ladies' "Rag" are able to pay for the best hotel accommoda

acteristic of the average "social" club in England aren't In favor at the ladles'

individual rather than co-operative club entertaining and are determined to de
vote their efforts as an executive staff to making the club members comfort

Kfzm ONDON, Aug. 8.â There was never anything in the line of women's
I clubs, either in America or England, like "The Ladies' Army and Navy
I Club," which has suddenly become "the" thing in London. Although
J Â¦ .._ r^ ll was Dorn only a year ago, it now has 3500 members, and is going to
have 4000 before this year is out. It has just taken over a big and
famous old hotel in the very heart of the fashionable shopping district,
and is estimating its annual income at $45,000. from annual dues alone. $20,000
from rents of its bedrooms and $10,000 from profits on its food and winesâ with a
surplus over all running expenses of $17,500 h vear.
The irreverent call this surprising new institution "the "Amazons and Mer
maids," only near relations of men who hold, or have held, commissions in the
army or navy being admitted to membership. Other folk.' yet more Irreverent,
style the new concern "The Ladles' Rag," for the reason that the historic
"Army" and Navy Clu"b," from which the ladies have borrowed their name, has
been known by trie nickname of "The Rag" for time out of mind.
The building into which this biggest and richest of women's clubs has just
moved occupies a whole block in Burlington Gardens, just off Piccadilly.' It was
once the Bristol Hotel, the historic hostelry many times sheltering the late King
of Italy and other royal guests.

PARIS, Aug. 8.â A new typesetting ma
chine for composing by telegraph Is being
exhibited in Paris in the offices of the
Temps. It consists in reality of four
separate' machines. The first resembles
an ordinary typewriter, by means of
which the characters are Inscribed on a
band of paper by a peculiar system of
perforations. This can be telegraphed
anywhere and distributed in thousands of
copies without .necessitating any tran
scription. The band of paper, when it ar
rives In a printing office, is simply passed
through the apparatus number four and
the composition is done.
Type Set by Telegraph.
A staff of sixty servants is already hired and the club also supports a little
army of clerks, typists, hairdressers and manicure girls. The dining-room, said
to be the finest clubroom in London, will seat 200 at a pinch and 180 is the usual
numbev served. Members have a cozy retreat, too, where they can buy as
little iU a single ham sandwich if they want It or a modest bowl of soup, with
out the necessity of everybody's knowing about this little economy. In the big.
dining-rooms everything is table d'hote. >
The Ladies' Army and Navy Club is one of two women's organizations in.
London which boasts a billiard-room, and . there's to be a big billiard match be
fore long when- the only "lady billiard marker" in London will preside. The
click of the ivory can be heard in that billiard-room pretty steadily from 10 in
the morning .Â¦ till 11 at, night, . and It Is an interesting and rather significant fact
that the billiard-room Is open even on Sundays after" 3 In the afternoon. And
don't suppose that- these up-to-date 'women play billiards without stakes.
Likewise â¢ the cardroom is a lively ; and sometimes a costly place-^Sunday or
any other, day. Theoretically, at least, â¢ you ; may not. play whist; for more than
25 cents a point, or bridge for, more than 2 cents a point.or piquet for 1 cent a
point, or bezique for 4 cents a hundredâ but that doesn't mean that devotees of
bridge, for Instance, do. not exchange a good bit. of money back and forth in the
course of a long hard afternoon 'and evening, broken only by an hour for dinner,,
and fifteen minutes for a cigarette thereafter. There is a smoking-room, of course,
but you . can , smoke , also in . the! bllllard-room 'and in , t he lounging room. 'Another,

The present secretary, Mrs. G. A. Dundas. whose army connections are of long
and honored standing, saw the fallacy of social clubs and clubs run with no
particular idea of business behind them. So she became a promoter in a fashion
that would have done credit to Pierpont Morgan. Perhaps the fact that her
offices in the Walsingham House were under the same roof as those of the
redoubtable Ernest Terah Hooley gave point to her pen. although her scheme
proved as sound as most of the celebrated Hooley schemes proved shady. She
started the club on very Mttle capital,' but when its success was so great that it
became evident it must move out of its first home in Dover street before It was
a year old. sh< put forth a scheme for the Issue of 12.500 6 per cent shares of $5
each, in order to get the Bristol Hotel on a lease of fifty-three years. Most
of the stock was taken by the members, and according to the semi-annual issued
last week, that stock was an "uncommonly- good investment. One result of the
as well as social, success of the club is that its secretary has been
considering the plan of. going over to America to start a similar institution In
New York.
Â¦â¢Â». The Ladies" Army' and Navy Club claims other reasons for being the biggest
woman's club in the world than the mere size cf its membership list. AH sorts
of Important people belong to it. Her Serene Highnes3 Princess Edward of

and help If a similar Institution is started In America. Another distinguished

American Hostesses in London." The fact
is Mrs. Drumraond is English of the Eng

Antrobus. daughter of one of the bankers
Antrobus associated with Coutts. The
mistake arose out of Mrs. Drummond's
long residence In America and Canada,
when Captain Drummond was on Lord

activity of the Ladies' Empire Club, which

"The 'cane' business?" I queried.
"Like this," and Kolb got up, picked
a hook-headed cane from a corner, passed
it over to Mr. Dill and said: "Show her,
Max."
The chort man took the -cane and Kolb
said to him: "Aw, you, I'm going." turn-
Ing away. Then Dill hooked the tall man
by the arm as he was walking off and
said: "Walt a moment," etc. Twice they
did this, then Kolb angrily snatched the
cane from Dill and brought it within a
breathless ace of Dill's skull.
I gasped, as Kolb Bald: "That's the
'cane business.' but It cost up too much
In llnfment. Of course, Mr. Dill wore a
block under his wig when I hit him,
butâ"
"Oh. it's all in the game." the comedian
replied, with a certain pride. "Of course,
Max collapsed afterward, but he was on
the boards again In a week or two on
crutches."
"One could make a Rood story of the
dangers of the stage," I suggested.
"Come to me when you want to write
it." Dill said cheerfully. "I've had my
wrist broken four times, sprained my
anklo? â all sorts of things." â¢
"It's better since we dropped the 'cane'
businessâ that's too dangerous," Kolb
contributed. .
"But howâ?"
"How long have you been together?" I
asked.
"Four years," Kolb replied.
"And I've been getting the worst of It
nM the time,"- Dill laughed.
"Don't you sometimes get hurt?" I
asked.
Kolb replied: "Not at allâ barring
small things like getting a leg broken.
Mr. Dill fell at the end of 'Twlrly-Whlr
ly's* first act, for instance, and he went
on again in the third act and did his
etunt sitting on a fence at the back."
"Five feet and five and a half inches."
the short man answered, "and here 13
where I lose." his head sagging on his
shoulders and his legs bowed a la Grop
pengeiser. "And I suppose it keeps me
stout playing fat parts." he chuckled
sweetly.
"He's picked up awful since we came
here!" Mr. Kolb affectionately concluded.
"After that we must go," I said, and
asked, as the two rose- to say good-by,
"how tall are you, actually?"
"Six feet and a half." Kolb replied,
"but I lose doing this"â sinking his head in
his shoulders. Then raising the aforesaid
shoulders, he said, "but I gain doing
this." wonderfully seeming to gain ai
least a foot. ,
"And you are, Mr. Dill?"
"Oh, the manager says, 'I want some
thing here and here,' and Mr. Dill - and
Mr. Bernard and I get together and sug
gest things. The best suggestion is
chosen, perhaps a r&ce course scene, and
then we work it up. I say, 'I'll say this,"
and Bernard comes back at me with
something. That's all."
"And what next after this?"
"Well." and Kolb put his hand on Dill's
shoulders. "Mr. Dill and I have been
thinking for the last six months of Lon
don, of arranging a high-class specialty
and doing It gratis, perhaps, at tho Hip
podrome, to break In. We think very
favorably of the plan. Then If. Weber &
Fields follow us there they'll be Imitating
us!" and thl3 Naooleon of comedy
laughed his most at the Machiavellian
scheme.
"Quite much," Kolb said. "This last
show, for example, was a twenty-five
minutc affair at Weber and Fields. . We
spin it out to three acts."
"How do you make It?"
Fischer's has come in."
"You make up a lot of your own stuff,
of course?"
"But you prefer this kind of work?"
"Oh, yes,*' Kolb answered, and Dill
looked cheerful -agreement. "There Is
something to keep you interested all the
time. When you've done your turn In
vaudeville, you're through, in a strange
town, with only your hotel to go to and
nothing to do. : Here you can have a
home " and he looked around happily
upon the cozy room.
"Mrs. Kolb has been , very busy here,"
I ventured, also looking about me.
"I put that up," Kolb said, naively
vain, as my eyes wandered to the brown
fish net that drapes the whole room. . "I
climbed hundreds of steps in Dago town
to get that. Forty-five yards of It there
are ... .And I made this." "This"
was the most crnftsmanlike frame of a
little Chinese sketch. Then he showed me
a vase, that he had covered with cigar
bands, from which the usual portraits
had been removed and those of the
Fischer burlesquers Ingeniously substi
tuted. Then a tautly-bullt shelf. for bric
a-brac the. comedian showed me. and
various other carpentering exploits of his
leisure moments. Mrs. Kolb's predilec
tion is for the thing Japanese. Dainty
bits of Satsuma, cloisonne, embroidery,
mosales, brasses, Ivories, are strewn pro
fusely about the little room, that. Indeed,
is what Mr. Kolb calls itâ "a home."
"There is a particular pleasure in being
at Fischer's, too," the comedian resumed,
"apart from all this. There Is such har
mony among the cast. Every one tries to
help the other fellow along. When we
have a good turn Barney Bernard throws
everything our way. When the laugh
goes his way we, try to get him another.
Now in 'Twirly Whirly* we were Just
'feeders' for him, but we didn't throw
down our topis Just for that, and he never
says we're getting all the fat. Perhaps
you don'f know just how wonderful that
13. But that's .where the big success of
at the price. But they have to have us,
and I don't see any, Dutch teams wand/r
ing round loose. Art, oh, art! I figure out
art In theatricals by tne salary at the
end of It."
"I know which kind of art takes best
sometimes," he pursued, with a triumph
ant grin. "They were doing 'Faust' at
the "Hopkins Theater in St. Louis, and
they hired us to do specialties between
acts "
"Oh!" I said
"That's what the legitimates said," Mr.
Kolb laughed. "But talk about a hit!
The people crammed the place to seo Kolb
and Dill, and the legitimates stood be
hind the curtains jeering at the 'variety
rot.' We cot $75 a week between us
then."
-"Yours was not quite the ordinary Ger
man turn?" I said.
"No." Kolb replied. "No sauerkraut,
sausages, or 'my vlfe.' It was quite dif
ferent, in fact. -'When we went on the
Keith circuit they asked us what sort of
setting we wantedâ a garden set or a
bare stage. 'Not for me,' I said. 'We
want the palace arch.' " '
"'The palace arch?' â¢". I Interrupted.
"Oh, the ewell set," Kolb explained.
"They use it about twice a year at tho
Orpheumâ when Camille d'ArvIllo sings,
for exampleâ gilt chairs, fur rugs, the
'medallion' (carpet), easels and potted
palms. It looks like St. Peter's. ".. .
We went on in automobile coats, evening
drees, and, of course, when,. we got to
the rough stuff we made twice tue effect
we should havo done; In bum clothes.
Wo got a laugh before we opened our
face. v. . We followed Delia Fox on
the bill that time. < Her voice was just a3
bad as mine is now. They asked us whom,
we wanted to follow, and there was noth
ing deader than Delia thenâ she had to
give the ushers $3 a night "extra to ap
plaud," /i;Vt>"
"Oh, I broke his nose JubI once for fun,"
Dill testified, looking Kolb-ward with an
adoring air.
"I'm beginning to understand the dif
ficulties of getting understudies for Dutch
parts." I confessed.
"'Taint easy." Mr. Kolb- confirmed;
"The schools are turning out matinee
Idols every day, but not .Dutch teams.
The legitimates say we ought to be on a
laundry wagon, and that any fool can do
wcoden shoe stuff, and the managers kick
"But the block generally got the best of
it." the victim laughed, as if it were
quite the best of all possib,lte jokes.
"The pad has Its dangers, too," Kolb
went on, dropping back Into his chair. "I
remember kicking Mr. Dill onceâ where
was. it? No matter. But my foot slid
over the pad and got him. under the chin.
He managed to take the bow with me,
but dropped like a shot when we got off
the stage. I get hystericalâ sort ofâ
when anything like that happens, and he
looked so funny that when I found he
was not so badly hurt, I went to laugh-
Ing and couldn't stop. That cured him,
for he laid after me with a policeman's
property club, .chased me out of the
theater and round the park Just as I was.
And I went, too!"
"I was mad," Dill said comfortably.
"And you enjoy that sort of thing?â the
kicking and so on?" I queried.
"We enjoy the salary," Kolb answered,
"and we're here to make money for the
management. The gallery likes nothing
better than to have me kick Mr. Dill in
that rubber pad, or this " and he dealt
out a resounding slap on Dill's jaw.
"You didn't get next to that?" he
laughed. "No more do most folks. But
Mr. Dill really geta that on the hand he
puts up to ward It off."
"And where do you come in on this?" I
question Mr. Dill.
Kolb and Dill, Who Frankly Admit That the Feature of Their Work They Most Enjoy Is the Weekly Salary.
Dill smiled lazily, took the unlighted
cigar out of his mouth and gently pro
tested: "A little bit!"
"But I Fhall never forget Max's first
appearance." his pp.rtner grinned. "It
wss the funniest I ever saw. He had
ripped a white ve*t, up the back to fit
hfs extension at the front, dyed his nose
with the red of an artificial flower, and
wore a chin piece made out of the tall of
a KdulrrcL**
"But he borrowed the money, and put
on 'Fiddle Dee Dee' at Buffalo. Every
manager we spoke to about us going in
with Howard advised against it. They
t-ald we were throwing up a good vaude
ville encasement"â Mr. Kolb likes it
"vawdevlllc"â "for a big gamble. But
we crammed that Buffalo house for twen
ty-two weeks with one show, and then
toured Stair & Havlln's theaters under
Mike Shea's management, packing the
houses all along the line. Weber & Fields
wore pretty madâ why not! They were
petting only $100 a week for the whole
outfit. They got very much wise after
that. What do you think Fischer pays for
th*> lim*s alone?"
I confessed my Ignorance of the mar
ket aricf* of burlesque.
"Two hundred dollars a week." the
comedian informed me. "But Fischer
Kaw the show East and was bound to
have it h*Te"Â£t any price. And I tell you
the Miceess cf Fischer's is the ta!k of
New York now among the managersâ
that we're able to keen on a fhow for
four, five, eight weeks to packed houses
in a town of only 350.000 people."
"Who of the original company besides
yourselves are here, Mr. Kolb?" I asked.
"Miss Amber. Hope and Emerson, Miss
Vldot and Barney Bernard." he supplied.
"Blake and Hermsen Joined us here."
"Have you seen your rivals down at the
Grand Opera-house?" I a*ked.
Mr. Kolb looked paternally over at Dili,
Dill looked trustfully up at Kolb, then
they both emlled and the tall man Bald:
"We saw the end of their first show. Mr.
Dill here helped Caverly with his first
Dutch make-up. He put his pillows on
for himâ that was before we used the
rubber pad. . . . You used to sweat
a little bit under those feather?," to Dill.
said Mr. Dill
"Miss Vidot is at the photographer's.
â¢ thought she would be at home by now."
Misg Vidot's husband explained, dropping
into a. cozy chair that had evidently held
him before. Mr. Dill's also looked as if
it were made for him. and I must con
fest- to having found all the comforts of
Â«n interview among Mrs. Kolb's cushions.
And then the comedians began to talk
of the Weber & Fields shows in which
they have made their local fame.
"We were together in vaudeville, you
know, before we broke into burlesque."
Kolb beganâ he always begins. Dill add
ir.g a droll word now and then at Kolb's
prompting. "We got into the Weber &
Fields stunt this way: A few years ago
they bent cut six or seven of their shows
on the road and made a dead failure of
them. Bi:t Joe Howard saw them and
thought he could make 'em go." So he
went to Weber & Fields and asked what
they'd let him have the burlesaues and
whole productions for. They had failed,
and they thought Howard would, and
they asked him only $100 a week for cos
tumes and everything, but made him put
up 11000 guaranteeâ thought they'd have
him back on their hands in a couple' of
weeks. Howard didn't have a cent "

Mr. Dill is thinâ not by 136 pounds, nor

he Is quite differently plump, otherwise
trustful, than Kolb's vernal evening

As I have said before, you might pos
sibly know Mr. Kolb if you met him on
the street. His "stoop" is his own, as
well as that cf the "long of it" in the
Dutch team, as he says. Then Mr. Kolb's
massive shoulders and inchesâ 72 : i â rather

humorous nose is unmistakable, tooâ but
Mr. Kolb is waiting.
His charming little suite at the Prince

Vidotâ have adorned with all the com
forts of a home, quite explained why Mr.
Kolb found the Fischer stage, the cafe,
the dressing-room, all unsuited to the
purposes of interview. Five minutes' on
the cars took us there, during which the

'Spring' overture of Carl Goldmark. who
is a master of orchestral coloring. Here
it was made evident at once that the
claims of Philadelphia critics that their
city now has one of the best three or four
orchestras in America are well founded.
Mr. Scheel has been so fortunate as to
be able to pay for first-class players,
among whom are some importations from
abroad and some Philadelphians who
were clad to return to their own city as
soon as employment in a first-class band
was assured them. The result is an or

playing was a delightful surprise, and so
was the conducting of Mr. Scheel. who

Goldmark's 'Spring' overture was played
last Wednesday, and the greater part of

Mr. Fink of the Evening Post said:
And now here is what some of the New
York people had to say of the Philadel
phia orchestra and Mr. Scheel last season:
H. E. Krehbiel of the New York Trib
une thus expresses himself:
"Philadelphia is not likely to lose any
of its self-respect If it should chance to
learn that it is exceptionally favored in
the possession of such an organization as
that which proved its quality before a
New York audience last Wednesday, and
that the proper appreciation and adequate
support cf Its concerts would go far
toward justifying a large claim to musical
culture on the part of its citizens.
"There is no reason why Philadelphia
should not maintain such concerts. It
has a large population, great wealth and
much culture.

The first official vi.<it paid by Grand
President Stella FinkHdey during her
term was that to Minors Parlor No. 2 ot
this city, one of thÂ»- most loyal and truly
fraternal ot the local parlors. A visit to
this? parlor is a pleasure to one Â¦with a
fraternal spirit. f<ir there self iÂ« sunk, and
all that the Minerva girl? work for is the
common good, the upbuilding and not the
tearing down of the order. The visitor
was received with a cordial, whole-souled
welcome, that was dignified and which
<-ieated a pleasant impression on the
many non-members of the parlor who
wished, to sÂ«-e the grand officer. The hall
was filk-d with a dellctoui perfume from
thousands of blouosu. The work of the
ordej was conducted in a manner that
tailed forth commendation, and the busi
ness methods and the demeanor of the
members also came in for praise. Those
who had never before visited the parlor
were informed that the Minerva girls had
not "put on" for the occasion, but that
the same characteristics may be noticed
at alt meetings. After the business of the
evening was over the grand president
made a pleasant address, after which
Miss Minnie A. Wall, the president, on be
half of the parlor presented her a beauti
ful vase as a souvenir of her visit to a
per lor that wishes her success during her
tr-rm. Then Past Grand President Mrs.
Mary E. Tillmsn was called to the altar,
when the president presented her a hano
scme emblematic pin in grateful apprecln-"
(ton of her as a true Native Daughter and
of her difinterested services for the par
lor and order. Then followed addresses
Â»>y Junior Past Grand President Keith
and Grand Secretary Frakcs. After the
meeting icecream and cakes were served.
On the e\-ening of August 3 the new
officers of Keith Parlor, whose names
h*ve already been published In this de

t-Ifted by Miss M. H. O'Brien of Pinole
Parlor acting as grand marshal. The cere
mony wa* conduoted with an unusual
amount of impressiveness, and after the
work there was the presentation of a
handsome pin to Edith Hrown. the retir
ing president, and flowers to the deputy.
Then there was a recitation. "The Chariot
Ride" from "Ben Hur." by Miss Tanner,
enf vocal selections by Miss Langton,
rIro a few words of congratulation by
Junior Pact Grand President Eliza D.

he created the artistic sensation of the
jinks as the Indian runner, who made a
wild zigzag run down the wooded hill to
the front of nhe stage with the limelight
playing upon his bronzed figure.
Mr. AJtkin, who was stage manager,
went up on Tuesday, taking elaborate
scenery and costumes specially designed
by himself. Every detail had been given
scrupulous attention. A new feature of
this year's production was the back
ground of a large panoramic drop cur
tain, representing an Aztec settlement.
On previous occasions arising hill cov
ered with trees served as a background.
The brunt of the hard work of prepara
tion fell upon the shoulders of Robert
Aitken, the sculptor, who had given his
entire time and energy for several weeks
past to make the production an artistic
success.
The midsummer jinks given last even
ing by the talented members of the Bo
hemian Club at their camp In Bohemian
Grove surpassed In artistic merit any
production given for many a season. The
scenic effects were on a larger scale than
usual and the cast of characters was
specially large, nearly 100 performers ap
pearing upon the stage at once.
The subject was the story of Monte
zuma, the Aztec chief of olden times,
whose picturesque life exploits and down
fall and subsequent sacrifice to the god
of the sun were vividly and ably depicted
through the lyrics of Robertson, the sire
of the Jinks, and the unusually character
istic melodies of Dr. H. J. Stewart.
