The opening session of the encampment
of the Grand Army begins to-morrow
morning at the Grand Opera-house.
Though the pavilion attracted thou
sands there were thousands more who
spent the evening at the various State
headauarters.
The illuminations of the streets and
triumphal arches drew a vast throng to
Market street . and up to midnight the
streets were jammed.
The programme for to-day Includes the
big parade by the veterans of the Civil
War, a . monster concert at the pavilion
and many "campflres" and reunions.
Many of the branches of the Grand
Army held business sessions and elected
officers for the ensuing year, in order
that they might be able to attend the
convention of the main organization,
which opens to-morrow morning.
In the evening Commander in Chief
General Stewart was accorded a monster
ovation at the Mechanics' Pavilion,
where he was tendered a reception by the
Grand 'Army of the Republic, the Wom
an's Relief Corps and the Ladles of the
G. A. R. Â«
From early morn . until late at night
Market street was congested with traf
fic. . The thousands of visitors in the city
promenaded after the parade and visited
the various hotels where the headquarters
of the Grand Army and its kindred or
ganizations are located.
Open house was kept at all the head
quarters and the "reunion" of those who
figured in the stirring days of the early
'60's was of an impressive nature.
Not only the men . who fought for the
Union, but also the noble women who
went to the battlefields as nurses or who
ministered to the 'comforts of the sick
who returned from' the front met once
again yesterday and renewed old associa
tions.
The- big military ; parade in the morn
ing was witnessed by the largest crowd
ever seen In the streets of San Francisco.
The perfect weather added to the enjoy
ment of the brilliant . pageant and young
and old alike were profuse In their ex
pressions of pleasure at the spectacle af
forded.
& ay < HE second day of the Annual
* M Encampment of the _ Grand
Bj Army of the Republic was filled
m with interesting events and the
JBl. programme was carried through
without a single change.
Busy Day for
the Encamp*
ment.
"There have been reports that this
would be done if the trearty were rejected.
A bill may be introduced giving the termj
of a canal treaty with the United States
which would be satisfactory to Colombia
and also empowering the President to rat
ify personally a treaty drawn according
"The Colombian Senate has, according
to our best advices, rejected the canal by
unanimous vote. There are two ways In
which that treaty can be again considered
in the Senate. That body can vote to re
consider its action on Ux* treaty, or any
member of the Senate may propose
amendments to the treaty. Whether this
will be done is" a mere matter of specula?
tion until we hear more of the details of
the vote of August 12."
"What of the report that the Bogota
Government will endeavor to have Con
gress pass a bill along the lines of the
Spooner law; and what would be the
object of such action." was asked.
COLOMBIA WOULD DICTATE.
It is believed here that the President
may again ask for an expression of opin
ion from Congress before finally turning
to Nicaragua. In this connection it is
pointed out that an expression of opinion
could be quickly obtained from the Sen
ate if the President should have ready
for the extra session treaties with Nica
ragua and Costa Rica.
The .money has already been appropri
ated for a canal and no one contends that,
under the terms of the law, it cannot be
applied to one route if negotiations fail
in respect to another.
AWAIT NEWS FROM BOGOTA.
Apparently reflecting the still hopeful
feeling at Oyster Bay that the treaty may
be saved, officials at the State Depart
ment are talking about the steps the Bo
gota Government may take to reopen the
canal debate In the Colombian Senate.
Dr. Thomas Herran, Colombian Charge
d' Affaires, when asked to-night by what
method of procedure the Hay-Herran
treaty could again be brought to the at
tention of Colombian Congress, said:
"Precisely the same as at Washington
is the method of procedure in Bogota in
this matter. All treaties musf first be
submitted to the Senate, and, when rati
fied by that body, they are then sent to
the. House for consideration. If the Sen
ate rejects a treaty, it is obviously im
possible for it to come before the House.
Furthermore, it Is believed to be be
yond the intention of the Spooner law
for this Government to express to Co
lombia any desire that the Colombian
Senate's action be reconsidered. The
President is expected to wait the neces
sary time for the Colombian Congress to
adjourn finally without ratifying the
treaty before actually beginning negotia
tions- with Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
Any proposition to throw the whole mat
ter again into Congress at the coming 1
extra session was discouraged by the caÂ«
nal advocates in view of the fact that It
has been fought out completely and ttie
will of Congress explicitly expressed.
It is held also that the administration
has no authority to use what appears to
be coercive or threatening or dilatory
measures to complete the negotiations for
the Panama route.
Senators Morgan, Mitchell and Harris
of the Canal Committee of the Senate and
Representative Hepburn, who has for
years been the canal leader in- the House,
foresaw; the present situation and, both in
public and private, predicted exactly
what has occurred. All of these men now
take the ground that the President must
turn -to Nicaragua and apply the appro
priation carried in the bill to that route.
COLOMBIA FORFEITS CHANCE.
CALL. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W.* t Â¦WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.â That the
administration has gone to the extreme
limit in its negotiations with the republic
of Colombia looking to the construction
of a Panama canal appears to be the unit
ed opinion in Washington. In addition to
this, insinuations that this Government
would negotiate with the department of
Panama, should It become Independent,
are severely criticized. The. general opin
ion is that the United States Congress
â¢would never have passed the Spooner act
did it not contain the alternative proposi
tion to turn to Nicaragua in case of a fail
ure to deal satisfactorily with Colombia,
section 4 of the law making amplÂ£ pro
vision for just such an emergency as now
presents itself.

WIN BATTLE
WITH TURKS
Regulars Suffer a
Heavy Loss in m
Monastir.
Leave More Than Two
Hundred Dead or
Wounded.
Uskub Mussulmans Plan a
Massacre of Christian
Population.
60FIA, Bulgaria, Aug. 18.â A fierce bat
tle is reported to have occurred In the
neighborhood of Monastir. Three Turkish
Vattalior.s attacked 1000 Insurgents and
after the fight had raged for Eix hours
the Turks were repulsed with the loss of
"10 men killed and wounded. The insur
gent lo?s is not given.
According to a report from Uskub,
HSchatilovski. the Bulg-axlan leader, was
killed m the fighting at Krushevo, and
Iioris Saraloff, the noted insurgent chief,
has been surrounded at Prassbalkan, in
the southern part of the Monastlr vilayet.
The night train service between Salonica
and the Servian frontier has been sus
pended. Forty-three battalions of Turk
ish reserves in Europe have been called
A reign of terror is reported to prevail
at Uskub. where the Christian inhabitants
are afraid to leave their houses. The Vail
issued the strictest orders to the Mussul
man population to remain quiet and not
r:u!'*t their <runsitiaÂ»Â» n^ghtr.-n,' vÂ»Â»t t2xe
Mussulmans, meeting the mosques, have
resolved at a given signal to massacre,
the entire Christian population as soon
as the first insurgent band appears near
Uskub, or on any other pretext.
The Christians are terrorized. The Turk
ish troops, who are their only protection,
do not show the slightest disposition to
aid them. The attitude of the Turkish
troops was recently plainly manifested,
when a tralnload of soldiers, shortly after
ltavlrg Uskub, fired on the Bulgarian
workmen, who were repairing the track.
Three workmen were- killed and their
bodies were left lying on the line.
Telegraphic communication between So
f.a and Constantinople is interrupted, the
wires having been cut between Adriaa
eple and Constantinople. No telegrams
irotn Constantinople have been received
since 6 o'clock last evening. The Turkish
Â©facials at Adrianople refuse to state
where the break occurred.
Fears are expressed here regarding the
safety cf the railroad between Adrian
ople and Constantinople.
The Evening Post states that a band
cf Basbl Bazouks has crossed the Bulga
rian frontier in the district of Etheldere,
killed three frontier guards at Yatagans
end wounded two others. It also set fire
to several houses. This raid has created
great excitement in the district. The
tows is not confirmed officially.
The revolutionary organ, Autonyme,
cays the insurgents, after two unsuccess
ful attempts, have succeeded in destroy
ing with dynamite the bridge at Exscheie,
thereby stopping communication between
Salonica and Monastlr.
Reports received here from Constanti
nople and believed to be authentic con
firm the previous Etatements to the ef
fect that when the Turks recaptured
Krushcvo they slaughtered the entire
Christian pbpulation, without exception,
end it Is pointed out that among those
killed were the employes of the Govern
ment tobacco establishments, which were
under European control, as the proceeds
from the establishments were assigned to
the service cf the Turkish debt.
Russian Squadron Now in Position to
Enforce Demands.
MENACES TURKEY'S COAST.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Aug. 18.â The
Russian squadron of warships, which left
Bebastopcl yesterday, was expected to
have arrlvr-d off the Turkish coast this
afternoon to sunport the demands made
upon Tuikey by Russia in connection
with the assassination on August 7 of
M. Rostkovski, the Russian Consul in
Monastlr. The fact that Russia is about
to make a naval demonstration in Tur
wiFh waters has been kept a profound
secret here, the public being entirely igno
rant of the Russian movement.
The notification received of the sailing
of the sauadron was an unwelcome sur
prise to the Turkish Government, which
had pretended to believe that the Rost
kov&ki incident had been closed with the
punishment of the guilty persons.
The most recent advices received here
from Monastir were forwarded on Sun
day night and announced that the fight
ing between the insurgents and Turkish
troops in the vicinity of Krushovo con
tinued, and that many refugees from
neighboring villages had congregated at
Monastir. Several villages inhabited by
Greeks, it was added, had been set 9a
fire bv the insurgents.

The National Guard of the State made
a creditable showing. : They composed the
second division. Great . attention . was
manifested as the Citizen soldiery moved
The Denver Fife and Drum Corps pre
ceded the aids.' There were more than
fifty musicians and drummers. They were
attired in zouave costumes and created
a furor. The organization played to
gether with great skill. Marching up
Market street they played "Hiawatha"
and the drunrmers played a pretty ac
companiment on the bells which were at
tached to their drums." The first division
consisted of United States troops. The
regulars made their usual fine appear
ance. They swung along with a vigorous
stride and maneuvered in perfect style.
The Seventh Infantry Regiment, Â¦ com
manded by Lieutenant Colonel T. C.

Major C. W. Hobbs commanded the ar
tillery. Three battalions of field artillery
in command of Major J. V. White showed
up well. The . guns thundered over the

drew the heavy machines of war pranced
and cavorted as If they knew they were
on parade. Major H. Ludeno commanded
the first and Captain 8. H. Hunter the
second battalion of the Coast Artillery.
The men who fire the heavy pins and
mortars that guard the harbor marched
as only regulars can march.
In their wake came the marines and
sailors In command of Lieutenant J.yP.
Morton. The Jackles rolled along in ship

and those who watched them go by could
see that the right kind -of material was
in the ranks of the navy. The sailors
were young, bronzed and heavy set. ThÂ«r
carried Lee-Metford rifles and their bod
ies were encircled by heavy belts con
taining a dangerous looking bayonet and
rounds of cartridges. They looked ready
for business, but their errand was a

with food, clothing, health. liberty offered you,
you American prisoners turned proudly away
from the tendered prizes each one, saying:
"I may totter and die; these grim walls may
be the fartheet horizon upon which I may set
my eyes, and nothing but the grave may be
before me. but while I live I'll be true to my
country, I'll be true to my flag and to. my

LOYAL TO THE FLAG.
Indeed. It required a great, strong heart to
rush Into the heavy charges, meet heroic men
to conquerâ men ha heroic as themselves,
fighting with equal determination and energyâ
but It required heroism, too, when the men
wearing the blue stood determined in their
prisons for the preservation of their country
that this Oovernm-nt might endure.
It was in 1R61 you stepped to the front and
moved toward the mighty South, though It is
not for me to Â«sr*ak of the trials and tri
umphs. Every prisoner her*\ now free, bare
his cart and paid his penalty, but at Ittet re
ward came â a reward that shall be enduring.
There is no lot in time of war aa is the
lot of the prisoner. The man who marches in
the light of day with the sun beating down
upon his brain, thÂ« soldier whose limbs arÂ«
chilled at night as he stretches Mm^lf on the
STound to sleep, the wounded stretched out on
his cot in the hospital, all still have liberty,
companionship, friends, but you who w-ere de
prived of liberty lost the sunshine and the
dew of night and became a solitary Item when
you stepped behind the dark prison walls. To
you. my countrymen an* my comrades, it has
be*-n given to s*t the highest standard of sac
rifice and devotion.
When we look to the i>aÂ« and then to-day

A N army of the olden time, in lines of faded blue,
AA With drooping banners dulled and torn and guns that battles knew â
Old eyes look forth from 'neath the caps, gray hairs shade every brow,
And steps that once were firm with youth are slow and faltering now.

ONCE more the reveille is heard, once more the calls resound.
And hearts that feel the weight of years with quickened pulses bound.
Bright memory calls the past to view and lights eaclj faded eye,
And comrade meets with comrade old beneath this VVestern sky.

We have had another war since, a war also
waged for the principles of Justice and of
personal liberty, a war which to be sure has
made new veterans, which has called forth
In a hew measure the old patriotism, but has
also served to wipe out completely all feelings
of difference between those who were In the
great war adversaries and antagonists, and has
made the Grand Army of tha Republic In fact

munities. I accept It for the Grand Army of

trust and responsibility In this land of our*,
and two of whom fell In the highest executive
station within tha gift of this mighty peopla
and taught the American people how * soldier
can fight In war and die In peace â the brave
Garfleld and the eloquent McKlnley.
And when In 1865 there came an end to tha
conflict, there came an end to the dying, there
came an end to soldier life for the American
volunteer, there had been written on the eter
nal granite of history the name and the fama
of the American volunteer soldier, thera to re
main forever to prove an inspiration to genera
tions yet to be. (Applause.) We- had written,
we had hung out as' it were on banners
from the sky. the sayings of the great chief
tain that shall never be forgotten; we hunÂ«
out. "We will fight it out on this ltnÂ« if It
takes all summer" (cheers): and we hung
out, as if on the banner fVom the heavens.
"Unconditional surrender." (Renewed cheers.)
And then between the armed legions of blue
and of gray that had faced each other for four
years in deadly combat and had marched under
great and magnificent leadership, we saw tha
soldier of the ages, the great Grant, standing
between the lines uncovered and asking, "Let
us have peace." (Applause.)
Seventeen years ago I sat in this building in
a great campfire and concert of the Grand
Army of the Republic: this building was filled,
the entertainment was magnificent, and I shall
never forget as long as 1 live- the photograph
that came on my mind that night when a lady
here sang the "Battle Hymn of the Republic"
and stirred that great audience, and then. In
response to an encore, sang "Home. Sweet
Home." and I saw that audience become peace
ful and still and quiet as the grave. This was
at a campflre of the Grand Army of the Re
public held only seventeen years ago. We are
here again in California and In the magnificent
city of San Francisco. But seventeen years
from this day the surviving soldiery of tha
war for the suppression of the rebellion will
average about 81 or 82 years of age. Time wtll
have reaped a rich harvest and deep swathes

ACCEPTS GENEROUS WELCOME.
PEACE OVER THE LAND.
For four long years th* eoldiers of thÂ»
Union army and the soldiers of the Contrtei
ate army battled In this land of ours For four
long years they fought and they hied and died,
and as the graves were filled the homes of
the land were opened to let another son go
forth and take his place in the ranks.
We shall never forget the days of ISflt to
1865. Those were years of awful Import to
this land of ours; and locking back over thÂ«
years that are gone, we can recall tha hour of
parting, and we can see the troops gathering
In the villages and cities of this land: w Â¦ can
hear tha speeches that were made, the soul
sttrrlng music, and we can see the column, tha
company and the regiment move off day by
day and see the waving handkerchiefs ani al
most feel the thumping of the breaking hearts
In this day and time, removed as we are ranrm
than forty years from the beginning of that
great and terrible conflict.
the shouts of Tictcry and the groans of the
fallen brave to whom death came in the hour
of victory. Such memories, my comrades, re
main forever, and these memories will remain
in this land of ours as long as there are lips
to sseak and minds to remember.
The- sounding-board used to increase the
volume of music was in the form of a
huge shell, studded with electric lights
and beautified with the national colors.
The park band was never heard to better
advantage. Leader Paul Stelndorff
brought out all the beauties of the com
positions rendered and the musicians
were enthusiastically applauded after
each number. The selection of patriotic
pieces was a wise one and the music was
a feature of the evenings entertainment.
Governor Pardee was detained by rea
son of illness and General Shafter made
his apologies. There were cries for Lieu

ability and his speech was listened to with
deep : interest by bis auditors. He spoke
as follows:

with an : order to a captain of a battery In the
thick of the engagement. He rode up to the
captain of the battery and hÂ« delivered the
order and presented the compliments of his
commanding officer. It -vaÂ» very warm at
that time and the commander of the battery
turned to him and said: â¢â¢Would you like to

Colonel Klnne has a brilliant war rec
ord. It began with the famous Califor
nia Hundred, which waa eventually mus
tered into the Second Massachusetts
Cavalry and designated as Company A.
With that organization he participated
in some of the fiercest fighting of tho
war, beginning with a chase after Mosby
and his men and ending at Appomattox
Courthouse, where the last shot waa
fired and Lee surrendered to Grant. After
the grand review at Washington. Colonel
Kinne, who had already received promo
tion from first sergeant to the rank of
captain and assistant adjutant general of
volunteers, returned to this city, where
he re-entered the National Guard, from
which he had resigned at the outbreak of
the war. He has since held positions In
that organization ranging from major
and Judge advocate of the Second Brig
ade to lieutenant colonel and assistant
adjutant general on the division staff.
He has occupied offices in the Califor
nia G. A. R., and was department com
mander for two years. He la a member
of the Military Order of the Loyal Le
gion, of which he has been treasurer for
a number of years. _,".". ,

General Stewart and his assistants wera

During the forenoon General Miles paid
a friendly call on the commander In chief
and remained with him for about ten
minutes. Later several of General Black's]
friends called at headquarters and after
departing: one of them remarked that!
there was no further doubt that General
Miles would be. foremost among those
who will support the nomination of Black;
as successor to General Stewart.

known veteran was made yesterday. His
name will go before the convention oÂ£

two exceptions, it has been a custom of
the encampments to name for the posi

delegate from the city in which the en
campment is held, this as a mark of ap
preciation of the courtesies extended to
the veterans during their stay in tho
city. The only exceptions have been on,
two occasions when a strife was devel

Since there is no strife this year. Com

THE Spanish-American War Vet
erans met last night at the
Ellis street Armory. About
Beventy-flve were in attendance.
Surgeon General Brown called
the meeting to order. Comrade H. T.
Eime. past department commander of
California, was nominated temporary
chairman and T. P. O'Brien temporary
pf-cretary. The early part of the session
*aF devoted to a eort of desultory talk,
all leading up to the one general Idea of
the convention, that idea being the gen
eral amalgamation of all the societies
that have emanated from the Spanish-
American war.
On the topic in question speeches were
made by General Owen Summers, past
commander In chief of the National Asso

ans of Portland. Oregon; Rev. Chaplain
Wholly of Rhode Island: George Hollis
ter of San Francisco: W. S. Thompson

mers, who is brevet brigadier general of
the Second Oregon. United States Volun
teer?, made the principal speech of the
evening. His remarks brought forth
much applause. Unity was practically
the key note of his talk. His idea was
to bring together all the associations as
a unit, to follow in the. footsteps of the
Grand Army of the Republic.
The following committee on credentials
was appointed:
Comrade Brown of Washington, Com
rade O"Nell of California, and Comrade
Levy of Idaho.
The executive committee went into ses

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 18.-
In view of the epidemic of typhoid fever
which visited Stanford University and
Palo Alto last spring, it has been deemed
advisable by the university authorities to
enforce the proper sanitary conditions
wherever students or others connected
with the institution are temporarily re-
Fiding. In accordance with this precau
tionary measure, it has been decreed that
all boarding-houses or other places where
students are living, must be sufficiently
disinfected and arranged to satisfy a
close sanitary Inspection by Dr. TV. F.
Snow, the university health officer. This
rule affects not only the boarding-houses
on the campus, but also those of Palo
Alto, Mayfleld, College Terrace and Hen
lo Park, the neighboring towns. Follow
ing the inspection a certificate will be
Issued to the boarding-house keepers, and
students Wfio occupy rooms in uncertified
houses will not be allowed to enter the
university. This step was taken by the
advice of the health authorities of Santa
Clara County.

Alvarado had nearly 100O burros carry-
Ing bullion from his mine. to the railroad.
How much hay been: taken out of It no
one knows â possibly not L even 'Pedro Al
varado. At the works of the Palmillo
mine he has a steel cage In which are
bars of gold and silver to the estimated
value of J60,000,000. .
Alvarado recently offered to pay the
public debt of ; Mexico * as - a donation to
the Government. His offer was rejected
by Minister of s Finance Umantour. He
lived ln v a palace, which he receutly com
pleted near Parral, and when he visited
the town he was always accompanied by
an armed bodyguard of .twenty-flve men.
"John Hays Hammond is the greatest
expert In the world." said the agent, "and
he can tell all' about it."
"I know all about' it," said' Alvarado.
"I go through It every day." - .
"But this is a- great company. We
want to make, you an off er " on the . mine
if you will permit our expert to examine
it."
"I don't want to sell the property and,
furthermore, no experts are permitted to
enter my mine. I have anne'd guards
there' to keep* them out."
Finding it impossible . to get an expert
into the mine to' examine 'It' the agent of.
the company asked Alvarado to set ' a
price for his mine and .the company would
pay him cash down. To this proposition
Alvarado replied:
AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 18.â A private dis
patch was received here to-day from Chi
huahua, Mexico, stating that Pedro Al
varado, the multi-millionaire mining man
of Parral. that State, died there yester
day. He was sick bur a short time. He
Is survived by a wife and several chil
dren, who, It Is supposed will inherit his
fortune, estimated at seventy millions of
dollars. All of this vast fortune was
made within the past six yoars out of
the Palmillo mine.
The phenomenal richness of the Pal
millo mine has attracted the attention
off the entire mining- world. This mine
was discovered about four years ago by
Alvarado, then a Mexican peon, employed
as a workman in a mine at 50 cents a
day.
The American Smelting and Refining
Company, through its Mexican branch,
the Guggenheim Exploration Company,
recently made an unsuccessful effort to
open negotiations with Alvarado to pur
chase his mine. The agent of the great
mining corporation approached Alvarado
with a proposition that . Its mining ex
pert, John Hays Hammond, btj permitted
to inspect the mine.
"Why should he Inspect it?" said Al
varado.

for having the Union Iron Works complete its
contracts. Smith is receiver and is given full
charge of the properties, with the provision
only that the Union Iron Works shall be per

complete Ehlps. This was for the purpose of
preventing a cancellation of contracts by the

"Poor Biir'-r-and then the two veterans
fell to talking over old times until an
other of their number Joined them and
began plying a similar line of questions.
And thus were the old soldiers reunited
yesterday. It was a busy day for Grand
Army men around the different headquar^
ters. From one to another they plodded,
scanning registers and strange faces and
making anxious inquiries for those they
had not seen for over a quarter of a cen
tury. Time tells severely on the ranks
of the veterans and many an inquiry yes
terday developed the fact that the reaper
had preceded the searcher and relegated
"He's dead. Buried two years ago."

the g-uests were the following named:
Mrs. Frances Van Slyke, president; Mrs.
Sarah V. Sllnger, secretary; Mrs. Lucinda
Scott, counselor; Mrs. Birdseye, past
president; Mrs. Steismere, past president;
Mrs. Annie Miller and Mrs. Sopha Evers.
As a Fouvenir of the occasion each guest
of the evening received a miniature of
the fltg adopted by St. Louis for Its com
ir.g world's exposition.
In the headquarters of the Ladies of
the G. A. It. there are to be found a
number of candidates for the position of
national president of that organization,
which is now presided over by Mrs. M.
Annie Hall of New Tork. She has been
mentioned as a possible successor to her
self, owing to the fact that her present
term has been a short one, she having
succeeded Mrs. Hurst at the time of the
death of the last named. "
Among the other candidates for the po
sition are Mrs. RIggs of Ohio, Mrs. Mary
T. Hager of Illinois, Mrs. Man" Stock of
Missouri, Mrs. Ruth Foote of Colorado,
Mrs. Sue Staine of Washington State, and
Mrs. Bailey of this city. Mrs. Rlgga is
j-upppsed to be the strongest candidate to
date The election for national officers of
the Ladies of the Grand Army will take
place to-morrow afternoon at the eame
time as the members of the Woman's Re
lief Corps are choosing new officers.
Aside from the contest for the presi
dency of the organization the members
of the corps have not yet evidenced a
great interest in the question of national
officers for the coming year, for which
they will ballot to-morrow afternoon.
They have been too busy with other mat
ters" Yesterday the preliminary arrange
ments for the convention were under
taken and credentials were issued to del
egates and then the attention of the offi
cers was turned to social functions, which
was really the programmed detail of the
Mrs Sara D. Winans of Toledo,
a member of' the Andersonvilla Board and
one of the candidates for the position of
national president of the corps.
The heaÂ« quarters of the two depart
ments adjoin each other on the first floor
cf the Palace Hotel, and for the occasion
lust evening the doors between the two
suites were thrown open in order that
both departments could share the enjoy
ment of the evening. The reception was
informal, Mre. Winans being escorted to
the rooms by a deputation of ladies from
the two States, which are vigorously advo
cating her candidacy. Mrs. Winans was
accorded an enthusiastic ovation and spent
nearly two hours meeting the various
numbers of the corps of different States,
There are three candidates for the posi
tion of national president of the Woman's
Relief Corps, Mrs. Winans' opponents
being Mrs. Carrie R. Sparklin of St.
Louis and Mrs. Fannie Minot of New
Hampshire.
The friends of Mrs. Winans. however,
claim they have her contest already won.
and it was hinted at the reception last
evening that the function was more in
recognition of her assured elevation to
the honored position than a pre-election
boom.

Brilliant Scenes at
Women's Head'
quarters.
At a few of the headauarters. mainly
those of California, some pretense to en
tertain the visitors was made in the way
of disbursing liquid refreshments or dis
tributing fruit, the latter being accepted
as a grand treat by the majority of the
veterans from other States.
At the headauarters of the "Woman's
Relief Corps and tnose of the Ladies of
the G. A. R. the scenes were In noticeable
contrast to those within the rooms of the
gray haired soldier. Among the women
there was more of the hospitality that
is natural to the feminine sex and more
of the flutter that usually marks a gath
ering of this sort. While they, like the
veterans, had their official duties to per
form they accomplished their work
promptly and when through turned their
attention to their guests and made the
afternoon one long "at home" to every
body.
Their rooms were thronged with visi
tors, and particularly was this the case
at the national headauarters of the W.
R. C. where hundreds called to pay their
respects to the much beloved president,
and frequently the visitor left a kind re
membrance In the shape of a bouquetâ a
womanly token of gentleness. The floral
contributions and the festooned bunting.
with which the rooms are lavishly dec
orated, and the happy faces of beautiful
women who mingled there made the scene
at the headcuarters a most attractive
WOMEN ENTERTAIN.
The San Francisco public, exclusive of
the army element, was also part of the
human whirl around the veterans' head
quarters and experienced with the old
soldiers Its share of pleasant surprises
and serious disappointments In the search
for those who had not been seen for
many years. About the veterans the civil
ians would cather to overhear the ex
citing discussions of hard fought battles
and stories of the trials of the soldier
during the dark days of the Rebellion.
History was retold and retold as If the
events that made It were but the oc
currence of the previous day and some
times In so vivid a manner that the lis
tener could almost imagine that he could
smell the smoke as it passed off the field
of battle.
AH the headquarters kept open house
yesterday, hut with no particular pur
poses other than to afford an opportunity
for an exchange of information. BUI
Bane of Maine called on Texas to learn
something of hi3 old friend Abe Waters
and Smith of Oregon dropped Into the
Georgia cxuarters to find out if his rela
tive from the South was among the con
tingent of that far away State. As a
rule if the friends failed to meet some
satisfactory information was gleaned of
one or the other, and the visit netted
something in the way of gratification to
the curious caller. In every headquarters
there was a constant Jam until late in
the afternoon, when the gnawing vttals
of the tired veteran reminded him that
it was time to attend to the wants of. he

The G. A. R. display in the window
of the Wiley B. Allen Co.. the well
known piano dealers. 931-933 Market
street, has proved one of the strongest
attractions^, on Market street for â¢ the
past few daya.
There is always a large and enthu-
siastic crowd ' of visitors and residents
standing before this window, admiring
the singular beauty and heroic signifi-
cance of the display.
In the center stands a hero of '61
shaking hands with a hero of the Span-
ish-American war. Just behind them
is the typical figure of Columbia be-
stowing upon them both her blessings.
In each corner of the window stands a
soldier with gun in hand, ready for in-
stant service.
The display -Is well arranged - and
evinces the skill of the designer to ap-
preciate artistic values and at once ap-
peals to the patriotic sentiments ot the
American heart.

"I believe now, as I have for years, that
the Nicaragua canal Is better for all con
cerned, and especially for the shipping
interests of the United States."
Representative Hepburn, chairman of
the Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee, which considered all canal
legislation in the lower branch, expressed
himself more firmly than ever that the
duty of this country was to build the
Nicaragua canal. He said: '
to build the canal by the Nicaragua route.
I can't see any further necessity for ac
tion by our Congress. It put the matter
entirely in the hands of the President,
and there it stands. The President him
self must decide when time is up with
Colombia and when to open negotiations
with Nicaragua and Â»Costa Rica."
"I cannot . deny that I am thoroughly
disgusted, with the attitude of Colombia,"
8a4d Representative Grosvenor, In discus
sing the canal situation. "That country
does not know what is .good for it, and
its method in dealing with the United
States is altogether discreditable. We are
not called upon to keep on fooling with
Colombia. I should not be surprised lf
the State of Panama was already In the
beginning of a movement for secession.
There is no reason why we "could not
negotiate with Panama ! If It ever be
came an Independent State."

COLON, Aug. IS.â The ttatement made
In a dispatch from Foreign Minister Rico
to Senor Herran, the Colombian Minister
at Washington, announcing the rejection
of the canal treaty, and which was pub
lished here to-day, to the effect that the
Colombian Congress may furnish a basis
for a resumption of negotiations with the
United States, has caused a more hopeful
feeling In some quarters with regard to
the ultimate fate of the treaty. The
whole country Is anxiously awaiting the
future action of the United States.

to the provisions of such bill without re
ferring the convention back to Congress
for ratification. The object of such a
measure would be to save the Panama
canal scheme from total failure. This bill
would serve to guide the administration
in the drafting of a treaty which the
President could assure the United States
would be acceptable to Colombia. There
need be no longer delay than the time
necessary to draft such a treaty."
"In what respect would such treaty dif
fer from the one Just rejected?"
"The difference would be in the provi
sions giving the United States control of
the canal territory. The whole objection
to the treaty In the Colombian Senate is
that It gives the United States absolute
and perpetual sovereignty over the canal
strip. The opponents of the treaty In
sist that Colombia should share with the
United States in the control of the ter
ritory through which the waterway will
be built."
HIGHLAND. Aug. 18.â This place was
visited to-day by a tornado that uprooted
trees, blew down barns and In other ways
fild considerable damage. At 12:30 o'clock
it began raining slightly, and a light
breeze sprang up from the southeast.
Oft to the south could be seen a large
black cloud that traveled rapidly across
the valley. As It approached, the breeze
increased In strength, soon becoming a
veritable cyclone. The storm seemed to
proceed only along a narrow strip, and
trees, bouses and fences along its path
were uprooted and blown down. The ex
tent cf the damage is not known, but It
Is considerable.
Lightning struck a big willow tree In
the yard cf J. M. Clapp at 1313 C street
end tore It asunder. The tree fell over
en a buggy belonging to Mrs. J. Downer
of Bloomington. smashing it into kindling
wood. Â»
Early in the storm the wind and elec
tricity played havoc with the wires of the
San Bernardino Traction Company.
Heavy limbs falling across the wires
broke them down for a ulsjance of five
miles.
A barn belonging to J. Moreno, on the
Katz tract north of the base line, was
Ftruck by lightning" during the storm and
totally destroyed by lire. It is not known
whether there was anything stored in tfie
barn. When the bolt struck the ground
the vicinity trembled as though struck
by a heavy weight. Instantly the flames
leaped from the barn and despite the ex
ertions of the owner they swept the
entire structure.
The telephone system throughout the
city is completely paralyzed and It will be
some time before the linemen can restore
the system to service.
The weather was ripe for such a storm.
All morning the temperature hovered
around the 110 mark, and the atmosphere
was close and eultry. The sun was over
cast with clouds at 12:03 and the storm
could be seen bearing rapidly down on the
city from the southeast.
The velocity of the wir:d was probably
sixty miles per hour. Telephone wlreis in
various parts of the city were swept to
the ground by the storm and it will be
morning before repairs are made.
For more than an hour the local tele
phone exchange was a veritable chamber
of fire. The first wave of atmospheric
electricity burned out all the fuses and
from then until the storm had ended balls
of fire played around the boards, making
it dangerous for the operators to ap
proach them. Miss Eva Johnson was the
first of the operators to receive a shock.
She fell forward In her chair and for a
short time was unable to articulate. Just
as her companions had succeeded in re
storing her, the lightning- began to play
with renewed vigor, and this, with the
excitement of seeing Miss Johnson's con
dition, proved too much fcr the over
wrought nerves of Miss Addie Birch, who
was seized with hysterics and heart fail
ure. She fell in' a swoon, from which she
did not recover for an hour.

ROCKFORD, 111., Aug. 18.â The murder
of the Detroit boy Is Identical in circum
stances with the murder of Richard Tib
betts, a 7-year-old newsboy, here last
month. The details correspond. so closely
that the authorities believe the murderer
was the same man, a lunatic . of the
"Jack the Ripper" type, and are now in
communication with the Detroit police
on the subject.
DETROIT, Mich., Aug. 18.â TiRT tnutll
ated body of 4-year-old Alphonse Wllmes,
whose father lives on St Aubln avenue,
was found to-day in the rear of the
Michigan Stove Works. The hands were
tied behind with wire and a red hand
kerchief had been stuffed down the boy's
throat for a gag. All of the wounds had
apparently been made with some very
sharp instrument. Alphonse had been
missing from his home since yesterday.
Perhaps the strangest phase of the
mystery Is that there were only a few
small stains of blood on the body and
clothing of the lad, despite the horrible
character of his wounds. It looks as
though the murderer, after committing
the deed, washed the blood from the
body and then carried It to the lot where
it was found.
At the council meeting to-night the
Board of County Officers was requested to
offer a reward of $5000 for the arrest and
conviction of the murderer. The Council
also voted to offer $500 additional reward.

Is Victim of Fiendish
LOS AXGELE3. Aug. 18.â Despite the
fact that several suspects have been ar
rested, the mystery surrounding the mur
der of Eva Drouln, alias de Â£a
Graye, whose horribly mangled body was
found early this morning in a resort in
the red light district, is far from being
solved. The Coroner's Inquest to-day
threw no light upon the case, the Jury
rendering a verdict that the woman came
to her death at the hand3 of a person or
persons unknown. -
In the person of a negro named Pen
nlngton or Pendleton the detectives think
they have under arrest a man who, if he
did not commit the murder, participated
in the crime. Pennlngton was arrested
this afternoon upon a general description
furnlshbd by the women who saw a man
running from the scene of the murder a
few minutes before the body was found.
The capture was apparently a fortunate
one, for on the clothing which the negro
is known to have worn last night several
Urge spots of blood were found and he
cannot account for their 'presence. He
was put through a "sweating" process by
the officers and is said to have made some
damaging admissions, which the detec
tives refuse to give out ilor the reason
that through them they hope to find still
further evidence of his guilt and If too
much publicity is given the case this evi
dence could be destroyed.
It is known that the negro was In the
vicinity of the scene of the murder last
night and about the time It was discov
ered he was seen hurrying away. As to
the other suspects, of whom there are
four under arrest, the police have not
nearly so strong a circumstantial case.
No formal charge of murder will be
lodged against any of the prisoners until
more positive evidence Is secured against

patching up and mending here and there until
It seems almost impossible to conceive that
there is anything better. The non-concern of
the average business man has prevented him
from giving active thought to the subject, with
a determination to solve It. Time and experi
ence has demonstrated that the present sysem
Is wasteful and wholly void of beneficial re
sults. Our commercial Interests require that
every business man give support to the move
ment for durable roads by co-operating the
municipal and public interest, together with
the Boards of Trade. Chamber of Commerce,
manufacturing associations, transportation
and other business organizations with the agri
cultural and kindred Interests for the estab
lishment and maintenance of a comprehensive
system of public road improvement In their re
spective States and counties.
It has been argued with the persuasiveness
of a Paul that the National Government should
lend its aid to the construction of public high
ways. If the Government can expend vast
appropriations' for Â¦<- the improvement of
rivers and harbors, lend its aid to build rail
roads which are - but another class of public
highways, if it can expend millions of dollars
in the Philippines and Porto Rico, and -the
moneys of the Cubans in the construction of
wagon roads, if it can deliver the mails, sig
nal the weather, modernize farming, foater
and encourage , manufacturing by tariffs, and
aid and promote trade and transportation in
diverse other ways, what substantial reason
is there for not giving aid to the building of
roads and highways, the most common and
useful of all Interests it can conserve? This
phase of the subject is worthy of your inves
tigation and if it has your approval you should
enlist the active support of your Senators and
Representatives from your respective States
for the principles of the Brownlow bill, which
will receive special consideration during the
next session of the National Congress.
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM.
Thomas Richardson took for his sub
ject, "Immigration and Its Distribution,"
speaking in part as follows:
The question of Immigration Into the United
States is i one which has gradually been be
coming more acute during the past decade,
and which will continue to augment In im
portance and significance as the time pro
gresses.
From the time when the pilgrims were
forced from their early abiding places by the
tyranny of Illiberal and often despotic oppres
sion, and landed upon the then inhospitable
shores of New England, the old world has
been contributing in an ever increasing ratio
to the population of this country. Day by day,
month by month, and year by year, the sail
ing ships and the steamers have been lnci eas
ing their accomodatlons and efficiency. In
transit to take care of the Incoming throngs
of men, women and children, seeking pros
perity and habitation In the new "Golconda."
and paving the way in turn for the movement
of their relatives, friends and acquaintances.
While, of course, a very large proportion of
the Immigration which has yearly been coming
into this country through the Atlantic and
Gulf ports has been of a benigh character, it
la unfortunately the fact that our possessions
have been made the "dumping ground" of
Europe. | and the transportation of. undesirable
adults and their progeny has been facilitated
by private and governmental aid, not. because
of a particular desire to assist in the upbuild
ing of American citizenship, but rather through
a desire to rid the countries and provinces of
the old world of a class which contributed
but to the evil and villainy of the countries
out of which they were sent. â¢
Fortunately, the United States with its mag
nificent domain and possibilities for amalga
mation has been but little hurt through tha
causes mentioned. Be the newcomer what he
may, his nativity, habits, speech and thought
are obliterated forever In the secoad and third
generation, and even the traditions of early
habitation are absorbed by the free atmosphere
of the new home, and thus in less than hUf
a century there Is generated a purely Ameri
can type from which has been removed the
ills and attributes which characterized the
immigrant himself when first landed upon
American soil. . .
DUMPING GROUND OF EUROPE.
I am sure no one can blame the oppressed
and poor of Europe for seeking harbor In this
country. Yet the fact that we are the "dump-
Ing ground" of Europe Is a fact that haa
reached such gigantic proportions as to de
mand, .without any further delay, the urgent
attention i of . the United States authorities in
order to prevent a possible contamination of
our social | structure, and to . prevent also the
passing of our municipal governments Into the
control of ; people whose ' Inherent desires have
been' fostered by conditions existing elsewhere
and which should have no place in this country
of- ours. . : .:, ; f '
In my opinion the Trans-Mlsslssippi Commer
cial Congress should adopt some resolution lay
ing stress upon . the necessity ; for a much more
acute restriction In the matter of foreign im
migration. ; While certain restrictions at pres
ent prevail, not 2 per "cent of the aliens for ad
mittance at various sea Â¦ ports are returned to
their home : country because of t a failure to
come within the standard of the United State*

HORSE CREEK. Wyo.. Aug. 18.âCon
ductor M. J. Sullivan of a north-bound
Colorado and Southern freight train was
killed five miles north of Horse Creek
this morning and Brakeman Selbert was
badly injured. The train ran into a steer

Consideration of the report of the com
mittee on the advisability of merging the
Trans-Mississippi Congress with the Na
tional Irrigation Congress was then tak
en up and discussed at some length.
I believe. the time is ripe when the United
States Government should be forced by its rep
resentatives into establishing a rigid investi
gation into the character and possessions of

should be altered or amended so as to take into
consideration elements not now Included in the

There is almost universal agreement as to
the many advantages, and the need of good
roads â the serious problem is, "How to get
The public road is the most common of all
interests; it is promotlve of trade and com
merce, the adjuster of freight tariffs, the "al
ways on time," ready, open, way for all the
people. It leads to the church, the school, the
library, the town, the market, the mill, the
store, the place, of amusement, and the social
gathering. â¢. It places the farmer in touch with
the events of the world through the rural mall
delivery, with the dally paper, market reports,
latest periodicals and magazines containing the
best current thought of the hour. It equalizes
trade for the merchant and insures a steady
market for the farmer.
The question of building permanent high
ways is of the very. highest commercial Im
portance and demands the active attention of
all business men. The practice so long in use
of placing the burden of road making upon
the country j>eople is unjust and inequitable,
and will never secure improved roads. For
more than a century this system has been in
vogue, and to-day less - than one per cent of
the common road mileage Is macadamized or
surfaced, providing a durable road for all sea
sons of the year.
GOOD ROADS PROMOTE TRADE.
It is a matter of congratulation that this
congress haa given prominence to the subject
of the lmprovemenr of the public roads. The
question tlrst recognized by this body at Its
session in Salt Lake City in 1897, and at St.
Paul last year resolutions were adopted with
out discussion, recommending modern road
legislation tor the several States. It remained
for this session to give merited recognition to
this important question and assign a placer
upon its programme for presentation and. dis
cussion.
creatures who tax their energies to meet the
mere requirements and exigencies of partisan
politics, but for men of affairs who hold in
their hands the destinies of the greatest na
tion that ever rose and the fortunes of the
most commanding race of men and women the
history of this world has ever known.
When I consider the geographical position of
the United States with respect to Mexico, with
respect to the Pacific Coast states of Latin
America, with reference to the Pacific Coast
provinces of China, with their teeming millions
of population now dependent on Europe to pro
vide them with the necessities, and that Eu
rope, to gain the trade of the Orient, must
cross two oceans while the United States will
cross but one, I am convinced that the Great
Master of the Universe has designed the Amer
ican Republic to eventually become the, one
transcendent civilization- of the world.
At the afternoon session two important
addresses were made. W. R. Richardson,
secretary of- the' National Good Roads
Convention, spoke on "Good Roads."
His speech in part was as follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress: When Seattle
was selected as the place at which to convene
the Fourteenth Trans-Mlsslasippl Commercial
Congress there were not a f&w who shook their
heads and declared that Seattle, looking out
upon the far Pacific, was too distant from the
populous region of tha trans-Mlsslsslppl area
to command a large attendance. Delegates
from Louisiana and Texas who have respond
ed to the roll refute that prophecy. This is
significant In that it demonstrates that tha
Trans-Mississippi Congress has be
come a fixed entity among those great institu
tions that make for the progress of thÂ« Ameri
can republic.
The roar of Dcwey*i guns at Manila was the
strident voice of evolution. Destiny directed
that voice, and when it spoke It declared anew
the doctrine of the survival of the fittest and
blazed the way for American supremacy over
the world. Since that portentous hour, with
the economies for the promotion . of which It
was organized disposed of In a large measure,
the mission of the Trans-Mirslssippl Commer
cial Congress is become to insist on opening up
the routes to the markets of the Orient and to
the Pacific Coast States of Latin America that
the surplus products of the country may find
profitable sale, for by no other policy Is it pos
sible to Insure and to maintain the prosperity
and the commercial suprÂ«macy of the United
States.
Already the rmpid commercial growth of the
United Etatea ha* aroused a Jealousy and ap
prehension on the part of European powers
which all their infinite diplomacy cannot con
ceal. This Is gratifying to American pride, but
It likewise is & challenge: to American genius.
Whatever diplomatists may. tell you/ we stand
sJone without an ally in thin Titanic, struggle
for ruprtrnaey among the giant nations -if the

Thomas Richardson of New Orleans
then read the annual address of Presi
dent Kirby. It was in part as follows:
OUR COMMERCIAL GROWTH.
Following Governor McBride, Chairman
Gresham Introduced Mayor Thomas J.
Humes, who welcomed the delegates ' in
behalf of the city of Seattle.
SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. IS.â The
fourteenth annual session of the
Trans-Mississippi^ Commercial Con
gress, which Convened in this city
this morning, started out under
the most favorable auspices and promises
to be one of the most notable gatherings
in the history of the organization. The
attendance is unusually large, there be
ing delegates present from - every
State and Territory in the trans-Missis
sippi region, from Alaska and the Ha
; waiian Islands. Large delegations are
present from Oregon, Colorado, Texas
and Louisiana.
The sessions are being held in Leschi
Park Exposition hall on the shore of
I^ake Washington, some two miles from
the center of the city. Through the open
Bides of the building the delegates can
look out upon the beautifully kept park,
whose chores are washed by the magnifi
cent lake, which will one day become the
grandest fresh water naval reserve sta
tion in the world, and across it to the
heavy forests of Douglas firs and beyond
that to the snow-capped summits of the
Cascade range with Mount Rainier tow
ering above.
The delegates were rather slow in as
sembling and It was nearly 10 o'clock
when Donald G. Fletcher, chairman of
the local committee on arrangements,
called the assembly to order. Mr. Flet
cher stated that the president of the Con
gress, Hon. John H. Kirby of Houston,
Texas, had been called suddenly to New
York on important business and would
be unable to be present at the sessions
this year and that Judge C. J. Gavin,
chairman of the executive committee,
had been delayed in Portland on his way
here. He therefore introduced Hon. Wal
ter Gresham, former president of the
congress, as temporary presiding officer.
Mr. Gresham epoke briefly, referring to
his connection with the congress in pre
vious years and expressing his confidence
In the future usefulness of the organiza
tion. He then introduced Henry R. Mc-
Brlde of Washington, who, in behalf of
the State of Washington, delivered a
brief, address of welcome.
When the "West is developed to tha limit of
Its productive capacity and the ability of the
country to consume domestic products is over
reached, then what? This is a question for

It has been said that the population of the
United States doubles every thirty years If
so. where thirty years from to-day will we
care for an added 75,000.000 of people? You
say we will put them in the mighty West and
your answer has in it the inspiring suggestion
of a splendid prophecy rushing on to fulfill
ment. And why not? It Is estimated that
the Government can reclaim 100,000.000 acres
of land from the arid and desert wastes of the
Weft, while in Texas alone, if it were as
densely populated as Massachusetts we could
take care of 80,000,000 of the earth's popula
tion.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE "WEST.
of our exports over Imports is greater than
that of all other . countries combined. And It
is the trade balance that determines commer
cial primacy. The total exports for the year
1BO2 amounted to the dizzy aggregate of JJ.
.y>6,000,CKX). As recently as 1870 the total ex
ports were but $376,000,000, or $60,000,000 less
than the agsre&ate imports for that year, and
yet, as gratifying as is the vast balancs be
tween exports and Imports, it is but small
when compared to that " which will obtain
when we shaJl take from Germany and Great
Britain the Import trade of the Pacific Coast
States of Latin America, our geographical her
itage, and crowd upon the Asiatic the
products of our flour and cotton mills and
looms and foundries and machine shops.
It is out of the ground that the wealth of
tha surviving nation must come. It is the
farm that supports the fabric society. The
silver and the gold' mine will pinch out, oil
sands cease to yield their treasure and lum
ber forests be devoured by hungry mills, but
the American farm will stand as long as ihe
earth shall endure.
FIFTY COLORADO PEOPLE
POISONED BY ICECREAM
Analysis by Health Officer Shows
That Embalming Fluid Was
Used as Preservative.
. COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Au^. 13.â
More than fifty persons, the majority of
whom are tourists, in this city and Manl
tou, have been poisoned by eating ice
cream made by local dealers from a con-
Bignment of. cream received on Sunday
morning from one of the largest cream
eries and dairies in the State situated
near Denver. Analysis by the health offi
cers of Colorado Springs reveals the fact
that the cream was charged with for
maldehyde, better known as embalming
fluid, to keep it from souring. No. deaths
have resulted, although several cases are
critical.
The name of the company supplying tha
cream has not been made public. Health
Officer Hanford of this city states that
arrests will be made at once. The case
promises to be sensational.

people of the. city. . . I
A laundry trus t has been organized in this city
and all the leading purveyors to cleanliness liave been
united in the combination. We may soon expect
therefore to hear of the king of the washboard and to
be as familiar with his autocracy as we are with that of

all the other varieties of royalty bred by the marvel

It would be interesting to know who felt more
chagrined, Admiral Casey br~ the guardians of \ the
Puget Sound forts, when in a dense fog the gallant
fighting sailor slipped past the fortifications and won a
bloodless victory in the sham game of war! Admiral
Casey certainly, must have been jgrieved to discover
how helpless our- defenses are. when- put to, the test.
When they are absurd playing at war what would they
be in actual conflict? :/.- ,
A man in this city who sees shadowy and savage
shapes before him and trembles in {ear that the con
victs escaped from Folsom are seeking to murder
him has been arraigned on a questioh of his sanity.
If his fear of these desperate men, who have become
ubiquitous in our imaginations, be the only cause of
his trial there are thousands more in San Francisco
and in every other populous center in the State whose
sanity may be questioned with equal justice.
WHAT is admitted and discussed by the
Southern people and press as to their prison
system may be referred to in the North
without offense to the section involved. In most of
the Southern States all convicts, male and. female,
are leased to contractors, to work on plantations,
in coal and iron mines and phosphate pits.
The State of Mississippi is the only one in the
group that has an enlightened, humane and prop
erly punitive prison system. - It was achieved there
after the conscience of the State was aroused by the
John Howard Prison Reform Association, and the
question was carried into politics. There is a prison
shop for the manufacture of agricultural implements,
and a convict farm of several thousand acres. The
prisoners are disciplined without cruelty and the es
tablishment pays a profit to the State.
-Too much cannot be said in praise of the-Missis
sippi plan, and it may be studied usefully by peholb-
SOTJTHERN PRISONS
The Pennsylvania millionaire who spent $2000 for
a special train to carry him to the Corbett-Jerrries
fight in this city is a striking illustration of the fact
that there is at least one person in the world who
either doesn't care for money or doesn't know what it
means. Either or both ideas are dangerous to possess.
It is always the unexpected that happens, even in
Kentucky. After a series of delays, threats of assassi
nation, the calling out of State troops and a general
public upheaval, two desperate murderers were actually
convicted in a court of justice. After this astounding
violation of all precedent we are forced to give up^in
despair. We may as well reconcile ourselves to any
thing from Kentucky when she will thus sacrifice one
of her most deeply rooted principles.
"What interest can such a people have in prophecies
of calamity and creeds of discontent? We are for
prosperity and the deep-seated determination of our
people is to foster and further it. Whoever expects to
make headway with a gospel of lamentation in the
South will find that he is estrayed from his proper
pasture, if there be any proper pasture left in this
country for such an ass."
.That is pointedly rough on Mr. Bryan and the other
calamity criers in the wilderness. It is -a high com
pliment to the common sense of the South that even
its party organs admit the facts. What may be said
of prosperity in that section is equally true of every
part of the country and of every occupation of the
people. The broad and shining path of prosperity is
one of the roads that lead to Roosevelt.
THE editor of the Manufacturers' Record, Balti
more, has gathered comprehensive statistics of
the financial and industrial progress of the
South since 1897. He gives his statistics and their
in great detail, so as to leave no doubt of
their validity and reliability. The increased values of
visible property are taken from the official assessment
rolls. Between 1900 and 190.2 the gain, so shown, in
the values of realty and personalty in the South
was $460,000,000. or $230,000,000 per year, as against
Â£79.000.000 per annum for the preceding ten years.
There can be no great gain in the value of realty
and personalty unless there is great prosperity and
profit in the wealth-producing occupations, nor un
less the prosperity and profits are generally enjoyed
;:nd distributed with fair equality, share and share
alike, to those who have been the instruments of
their production. These official figures from the
South seem to make it necessary to revise the premise
of the calamity criers, who seek to induce political
action by insisting that the evident prosperity of the
country is beneficial to only a few, while the masses
are in peonage, and sow and reap for others and not
for themselves.
The statistics continue and include this year's crop
of the South. Cotton and cottonseed will bring to
the Southern planters, at plantation prices, during the
next twelve months S6oo.ooo,ooo, and the other agri
cultural products will add to this $900,000,000. The
value of the manufactured products of the South is
put at equality with the value of agricultural products,
which means that in one year three billions is added
lo the wealth of that section.
It is evident that the South has completely re
covered from the paralysis of the Civil War and is
now enjoying a greater and more general prosperity
than at any time in her history. She has reached this
high condition under a Republican administration
tnd under the fiscal and industrial policies of the Re
publican party. Without saying that her financial
felicity is due to those policies, it is admitted that
under them it exists, and no one undertakes to say
that it could have been greater under any other poli
cies, party or administration.
Discontent gets no hearing in the South. Mr. Wil
liam Randolph Hearst, in his paper, has repeatedly
said to his readers: "Remember, it is your first and
constant duty to make eveo'body discontented."
That declaration will injure his Presidential candi
dacy in the South.
The Atlanta Constitution, the greatest of Southern
Democratic papers, publishing and commenting on
the statistics of the prosperity of the Southern people,

DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOLK' of St Louis
has yielded to the great American temptation
and taken to the lecture platform. He has,
however, more in the way of excuse than the average
lecturer, for he has done something that interests all
intelligent Americans and has acquired an experience
which enables him to make his lectures as instructive
as they are interesting. Every community 'in the
United States recognizes thc^ value of the work done
by Mr. Folk in prosecuting the corrupt officials in
Missouri, and each is eager- to learn how a similar
purification can be wrought out at home. What Mr.
Folk has to say therefore is felt as a matter of local
concern wherever he speaks and his audiences are
drawn together by something more than that intel
lectual curiosity which generally impels men to listen
to any noted man or woman who comes to lecture to
them. "
What Mr. Folk has had to say in the lectures he
has delivered is in the main the repetition of a story
told by the press at the time when it was developing
in the law courts of Missouri. It is a story of how
a combine got control of the city government of St.
Louis and of the State government of Missouri apd
ran them for all there was in them. As one of the
reports of his lecture puts it, he told "how one fran
chise was sold for $250,000, twenty-three of the twenty
eight members of the Municipal Assembly taking at
least $3000 each, while seven received from $10,000 to
$17,500 for their votes. One member of the Â£ouncil
held out for $25,000, then for $50,000, and finally voted
iivr the expectation of receiving $100,000. Seven
Councilmen at one time were secretly on salaries of
$5000 a year to promote certain corporate interests.
A lighting bill was bribed through for $47,50O. These
representatives of the people conspired to sell out
the municipal water works, worth $40,000,000, for
$15,000,000, in order to make $100,000 apiece in rake
off. Even the old Courthouse and the municipal
market were almost sold in. order to enrich the city
legislators, and the market was saved only by a coun
ter corruption fund of $20,000 which the marketmen
raised in order to satisfy the greed of these miscreants
in power."
Of the men who were engaged in the corrupt deals
Mr. Folk says: "Some of these representatives are
fugitives from justice in foreign countries, others have
turned State's evidence, the remainder have faced
juries, and eighteen of these givers or takers of
bribes have received sentences ranging from two years
to seven years in the penitentiary."
So far the showing made for the law is excellent,
but unfortunately Mr. Folk had to tell his audience of
another feature of the situation which is by no means
so pleasant to' reflect upon. He toldjthem that de
spite all the revelations of corruption and fraud, de
spite\all the proofs furnished in court, despite the con
victions, there remains in St. Louis a powerful body
of men who are yet supporting the brike-takers and
the bribe-givers. They are denouncing all the prose
cutions and all the revelations as nothing more than
slanders on Missouri or slanders on St. Louis. That
body of men remains powerful and well organized. It
has a considerable public sentiment behind it^and it is
easy to see that as soon as the storm blows over the
corrupt syndicate will renew its efforts to control the
city and enrich its members by the spoliation of the
taxpayers.
It is thus made once more evident that the source
of political corruption is not to be found in municipal
councils, nor in State legislatures, but in the evil
elements of the community itself. Until there is some
way of getting rid of the bribe-givers and bribe in
stigators â¢ the. prosecution of the bribe-takers will
hardly work anything more than temporary relief.
Mr. Folkhas done" his duty well, but to keep St.
Louis free from boodlers will require the constant
succession in office of men as able, as fearless and as
honest as himself.
MUNICIPAL CORRUPTION.
Midnight attacks have become so alarmingly fre
quent in this" city that if they continue it may be ad
visable to include them among the social events of
San Francisco. The police should exert themselves,
capture- one of the knights of the road and hold him
for exhibition as a curiosity. â¢
ROME; Aug. IS.â A most important dis
covery was made to-day during excava

the base of the celebrated "equestrian
statue of the Roman Emperor. Domitlan.
which is of the greatest interest In de
termining the topography of the Forum

The unexpected feature of the conven

vote of a resolution declaring John !â¢â¢
Webster 1 of Omaha, one of the delegates
to the convention and one of the well
known party leaders of the State, to be
the choice of the Nebraska Republicans
for Vice President in 1S04. The resolu
tion was offered just after the conven
tion was about to adjourn and was re
ceived with enthusiasm.
"A portion of the platform relating to
national issues is as follows:
We congratulate not only ourselves,
the people at large, that the administrations
of our national affairs and our negotiations
with foreign nations are* being conducted by
the courageous Republican President who
knows no fear, who courts no favor, but who
loves peace crowned with honor and in whose
charge we have a feeling of perfect safety and
security â a President whom the American peo
ple now desire to honor with a second term as
the chief magistrate of the greatest and grand
est nation of the earth- â Theodore Roosevelt.
We adhere to the American protective pol
icy of the Republican part*, which has In
creased the revenues and not Impeded trade;
which has opened the doors of mills and tucto
rles to millions of American skilled mechanics
and is returning to them , the higher wages
which are the just recompense of their toil.
The Kepublican party recognizes that legit
imate business fairly Â¦ capitalized and honestly
conducted has increased our industries at homo
and expanded our trade abroad and enabled us
to successfully compete with foreign countries
in the markets of the world, but the Repub
lican party is unalterably opposed to all com
binations ,of capital under whatever name* hav
ing for their purpose the stifling of competition
and arbitrarily controlling . production or fix
ing prices.
The Philippines are ours as the legitimate
and crowning, result of honorable warfare, and
we hold them for, barter or sale, but as a
part of- the national domain made sacred to
us by the American blood which has been shed
to plant and maintain the Stars and Stripes
upon the far-off isles of the Pacific Ocean. .
Is sometimes almost as difficult as nam
ing the baby. You find the task an easy
one if you bring your pictures to us and
try the moldings and mats here. We have
so many varieties of moldings an'd such
exquisite ones that a satisfactory selec
tion is quickly made. Sanborn, Vail &

outlined with stalks of pink amaryllis,
which also concealed the mantels,
together with sweet peas and ferns tied

was converted into a bower of foliage and
pink ribbon. Ropes of smilax in various
lengths extended from the celling, form

Just what will happen as the next curiosity of lynch
ing no one can foresee. The fad grows on what it
feeds upon. But one longs for Graham and his bread,
Thompson and his cayenne squirt gun, Miller and his
end of the world and the other good old fads of our
grandfathers.
The Sk^neateles community in New ,York under
took to live on philosophy and the beatitudes. Horace
Grecley hurried off to a Socialist community in Penn
sylvania. The Shakers established themselves at New
Lebanon as followers of celibacy and "Mother Ann."
Jemima Wilkinson appeared at Penn Yan, N.^.Y.,
as a female incarnation of the Messiah and tried to
walk on the water of Crooked Joseph Smith
and "the witnesses" promulgated the Book of Mor
mon. The Fox sisters began spiritual rapping and
made the world's hair rise with "the Rochester
knockings." All kinds of reforms, marvels, wonders
and curious things were afloat, and if the credulous
and superstitious did not see what they wanted, they
had only to ask for it. Then the Civil War came on
and in- the potency of its passion and its intense and
mighty call to the people all things else were burned
as by fire and no sound was heard but that of the
great trumpet that called the sons of the republic
to exertion and fidelity unto death.
Since then another generation has arisen and an
other is coming with manhood just thickening it*
neck. The old disposition to take up a fad is still
upon man. But unfortunately the fad now seeing to"
be lynching. Men and women are lynched, and what
is supposed to be justice is administered, al frseco,
while the dust gathers on the Judge's desk and in
the jury box of the criminal courts, for their place
is usurped and their function assumed by the mob.
The savagery of the fad is progressive. At first the
victims were hanged. Then soon it was the rule to
riddle their dead and pendent bodies with bullets.
Then they were shot full of lead as they were strung
up. Next a mob of artists in lynching, having shot
and hanged a man, cut. his body down and burned
it. 3*he next step was a short one, and was taken,
we believe, in Texas, where the victim was caught,
condemned, pinioned and burned alive, tied to a stake.
Observers believed that this marked the high tide
of the fad and that the horror of it would have a
repellent effect and that the horror of it would r |a*Â£ .a.
decline and disappear. But they were mistaken. The
horror of the stake became a fascination. It seemed
to fittingly express the spirit of revenge roused by the
vile nature of the crime which it expiated, and in sev
eral instances it has been used to punish offenses-, of
less enormity.
This horrible fad is not confined to any section.
In all divisions of the States it is rampant. The South
has furnished the greatest number of cases, but they
do not differ in kind from those that- have occurred
in Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Indiana, Illinois and
other States. In the dispatches of one day recently a
rope was being knotted for a negro woman, in South
Carolina, who beheaded her children and burned their
bodies, negroes being the intended avengers. A Mis
souri Sheriff was standing off a mob that desired to
lynch a loafer for shooting an officer. A Delaware
mob was in hot pursuit of a negro to burn him for
shooting a constable. Minnesota lynchers were in
pursuit of a wretch guilty of an unspeakable crime,
and the same cause moved another party in Ohio.
But the oddest of all that day's doings appeared in
Georgia. A penitentiary Warden was the threatened Â¦
victim. Among his prisoners is a white woman, a
Miss Crist, known as "the Diamond Queen," born
of a good family, and believed to be insane. The
Warden's name is Alagood, and he ordered Miss
Crist, though a delicate woman, to work as a fieldhand
with 'the negro prisoners, incited thereto by his wife. ;
Now Mrs. Alagood's methods seem to belie her name,
since they were a la bad. When Miss Crist protested
against assignment to field work Mrs. Alagood or- .
dered her husband to have her whipped. Thereupon
the frail white woman was taken to the' torture-room,
tied up and given forty lashes on the bare back by
the Warden. The thongs cut to the ribs and left
gashes in her breast No male prisoner had ever re
ceived more than ten lashes, but the Warden's wife
is thorough in what she undertakes." At once Georgia
was on fire and immediately it was proposed to lynch
the Warden. He made Adam's excuse that his wife
ordered it, and the Governor proceeded to investi
gate. But the Alagoods don't show themselves in
public and the masks and the rope are ready if the
Warden is caught. .
Thompson appeared with his new school of medi
cine and squirted a stream of "No. Six" and lobelia
into his followers. Preissnitz promulgated his Graf
fenberg water cure, and his followers were legion, be
lieving that a tub and wet bandage would enable men
to rearh the age of Methusaleh with all the virtues of
Melchizedek. The Socialist theories of Fourier fitted
into the tendency of the time, and Charles A. Dana
and others retired to whittle out a new world and a
new heaven at Brook Farm.
THE American people, or a portion of them, are
given to fads. Between 1836 and the outbreak
- of the Civil War there was a procession of fads.
The Millerites gave away their property,* "made long
white nightshirts, put them on and took to the hills
and housetops lo get a good start heavenward when
the end of the world came. Graham got dyspepsia
and lived on bran bread, and immediately Graham
bread was accepted by the faddjsts as a panacea for all
ills, and a dietetic reform began and went to such
extremes that eating anything threatened to be un
fashionable.

gists and by the officials of other States. But out
side of Mississippi,, even in such progressive States
as Georgia, -the- system is" execrable. The leased
convicts are put in charge of overseers, by compari
son with whom the worst picture of the old slave
driver, ever "conjured by the heated imagination of the
abolitionists ; was a ] beatitude. Prisoners are under
fed, underclad, overflogged, chained together at night
and overworked by day.
Literature has made the world familiar with the
woes of the â¢ galley-slave in European countries,
where a sentence to the galleys is a sentence to
death. But the condition of the leased convict in the
South is more, woeful "and wretched. It is an in
ducement to- increase the list of felonies, transferring
thereto what elsewhere are misdemeanors only, and
to lengthen the sentence, in order to satisfy the greed
of contractors by increasing the number of involun
tary laborers. There is no attempt to apply the prin- j
ciples of prison reform. Moral growth is left out of
the question entirely, and good and bad alike. are
subjected to a system that has no equal of its hor
rors since the middle ages. Good men and women of
the South are having their humanity quickened by
the awful spectacle, and soon some disciple of JoHn
Howard will sound the trumpet of reform. The
horror in Georgia*" where a white woman was flayed
by the whip may be the beginning of better things.

New Novels of This
Money-Mad World
THE world is money mad. That statement looks absolutely start-
ling in cold type, but when you realize that it is a sentiment em-
anatintr from the foremost political and financial economists of the
world it is time to begin to sit up and take notice. If you. doubt its
truth just take a casual dance at the popular literature of the hour.
You will invariably find that the theme is wealth, and more wealth, and
yet again more wealthâ wealth in the spending even as much as wealth
in the making. Not the fairy tale lore of wealth of byjjone asres, but
modern wealth that has to do with empire building the destiny of na-
tions, the struggle for commercial dominance and aristocratic soda! su-
premacy of the men and women of the hour. yea. almost of the very
minute, so vast and so rapid is the rise and fall of the bureauocracy of
wealth. No more the tales of buried treasure of picturesque pirates or
lost mines and enchanted palaces stored with riches, but the trold that
glitters before our very eyesâ rich, ytllow gold that we watch in the
making â gold that is accumulated while you wait by men we all know,
and spent with greater ease and facility by women who are Detter
known.
Of such a dozen books that everybody is reading risrht now mhtht
be mentioned at- random. To begin with there is "The Spenders."
which was concluded in last Sunday's Call, and which not only shows
the excitement of modern money making, but the more subtle art of
spending it. Then there is "The Octopus," Frank Norris' famous tale
of the building of vast wealth, and his, later book. "The Pit." which tells
of the awful struggle to corner that same vast wealth. Then there are
"The Autocrat." "The Thirteenth District," "Tainted Gold." "The Mis-
sissippi Bubble," etc.. etc. Indeed the list might be swelled indefinitely.
But of all these novels. none are quite like unto that very latest
creation, "Brewster's Millions." In point of fact "Brewster's Millions"
is absolutely unlike anything that has ever been written before, for in it
a perfectly adorable young fellow has to spend a million a year, ret his
money's worth and vet -have absolutely nothing to show for it at the
Â« .d of that time. in order that he may inherit six million more. Sounds
fascinating, doesn't it? Well, it is more than that.
Now you may. think it is the, easiest thinsr in the world to spend a
million. Never tried it, of course. But wait until you have read*
"Brewster's Millions." which begins in the next SundayCall. and you
will see what a stupendous task it is to spend a million a yearâ actually
spend it â not dissipate it or give it away or lose it in false speculation,
but get your money's worth as you would if -you had only a hundred in-
stead of a cool pillion. ' ,
But the popular craze of literature of the bright, snappy, uo-to-date
sort goes even further than this. Never before was there such a tre-
mendous demand for short stories of thr' best sort. And what belter
reading could you get? # A good <bort story is a complete novel in con-
densed form, and it is iust such . reading as this that, is pro-
vided in the Sunday Call's new "Half Hour Storiettes." of which, next
Sunday, you wiU get two full pases. Here are some of the titTes*
"Mysterious LeQfric." "In. the F T -Â»*h of Strined Death." "The Secret of
the Jamaica Sink Hole." j'The Beautifnl MÂ«s3 Marrhm." "FaWes for
the Foolish," "Shorty Mahan's Passing." "Love's. Golden Tether"
-"While the Train: Waited.". ."WTin Tiny.Petrr Did." >tr.; etc â¢: B-st of

MANY BEVOLVEB SHOTS
MAKE SAILORS UNHAPPY
"When the subject of allowing Chief
Sullvan $1009 first came up about two
weeks ago," said Baehr, "it was stated
that the money could be paid out of the
Fire Commissioners' fund. I then and
there declared that no provision was
made ln the fund for the expense de
sired to be incurred and that I would not
sign the demand If it were drawn on that
fund. When asked out of what fund It
could be drawn I said that the only fund
which the Supervisors could draw on for
the purpose was the "Urgent Necessity
Fund.' Even then I am not quite sure
that the money could be legally paid out
of that fund, although it might be done
on the plea that no other fund is avail
able. I certainly will not audit the de
mand on the regular fund of the Fire
Department." /
According to the terms of the resolu
tion on the subject the money is made
payable out of the appropriation for the
Fire Department in this year's munici
pal budget.
Auditor Baehr said yesterday that he
would decline to audit the demand on the
fund named and expressed surprise that
the Board of Supervisors had taken.ac
tion especially after he had notified the
finance committee that he would not al
low the Fire Department fund to be
drawn on for the purpose.

what a grand faith Catholicism
is. He mentioned also that he was grat
ified to know that the Grand Council had
adjourned ln honor of the memory of the

Mi$s Alice M. Smith, of Minneapolis,
Minn., tells how woman's monthly suffering
may be quickly and permanently relieved by
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
" Dear Mbs. Pixkiiam : â I have never before given ray endorse-
ment for any medicine, but Lydia E. Pinkham's Vearetable Com-
pound has added so much to my life and happiness that I feel lite,
making in this case. For two years every month I would
have two days 01 severe pain and could find no relief, but one day when
visiting a friend I run across Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, â she had used it with the best results and advised me to try it.
I found that it worked wonders with me ; I now experience no pain and
only had to use a few bottles to bring about this wonderful change. I
use it occasionally now when I am exceptionally tired or worn out." â
Miss Alive M. Siirrn, 804 Third Ave., South Minneapolis, Minn., Chair-
man Executive Committee Minneapolis Study Club.
Beauty and strength in women vanish earlv in life because of
monthly pain or some menstrual irregularity. Many suffer silently
and see their best gifts fade away. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound helps women preserve roundness of form and.
freshness of face because it makes their entire female organism
healthy. It carries "women safely through the various natural
crises and is the safeguard of woman's health.
The t uth about this great medicine is told in the letters from
women bi .ng published in this paper constantly.
Mrs. C. Kleinschrodt, Morrison, 111., says: â
.. "Diau Mrs. Pixkham: â I have suffered ever
ji?$fÂ£rj^wjk since I was thirteen years of age with my menses.
vf^Uj^lTiSF They were irregular and very painful. I
tt-*l'Â£^'^Qy}T$\ a great deal but received no benefit.
â¢g&f *^^J " A friend advised me to try Lydia E.
W#'~ m \ *-^ ftf/ Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, Which I
Jais^) ** Bar did, and after taking a few bottles of it, I found
tflf H m\ aj u gTeat relief.

r if //j^Tfmrrm\ How is itpossible for us to make it plainer
/ / JUJU }| ' 1 that Lydia Ef. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
/ j(" j I pound trill positively help all sick women ?
I / I All women are constituted alike, rich and poor,
I J * high and low, â all suffer from the same organic
troubles. Surely, no one can wish to remain weak
and sickly, discouraged with life and no hope for the future, when proof is so
unmistakable that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vejretable Compound will euro
monthly suffering â all womb and ovarian troubles, and all the Ills peculiar
to wotnen.

After supper for the crews the tug Guid
ing Star took the Reliance in tow, while
the English tug. Cruiser, performed the
same service for the Shamrock III,-- both
the yachts arriving at Sandy Hook at
about sundown. .
The Reliance, and Shamrock swung laz
ily at their moorings Inside Sandy Hook
to-night, ready for the International con
test for the America's cup, the first race
of which will be sailed on Thursday. The
Shamrock III merely returned to her old
moorings < the Reliance coming here for
the first time. The day was one of ex
ceeding interest to all directly interested
In the international race, being devoted
to the official measuring and final groom-
Ings of both yachts. The cleaning of the
under bodies of both was completed this
morning, and Charles ,D. Mower, the offi
cial measurer of the New York Yacht
Club, stretched his steel tape from truck
to deck and from the end of the bowsprit
to the extreme point of the after over
hang of both racers. As one result about
eight Inches of the spinnaker boom . of
the Shamrock III was sawed off, owing
to the fact that It was estimated to be
that much longer than the base of the
forward triangle, which covers the head
sails of the yacht, which would mean
penalization If allowed to stand. Sir
Thomas I,ipton, as well as Mr. Iselin and
Designer Herreshoff and Designer Fife,
were Interested spectators of the work
of Mr.' Mower. Designer Fife evidently
desired that the Shamrock III should be
measured while down by the I stern as
much as possible, for everything mov
able, even to the Jib sheet leader blocks,
was moved and stowed amidships. The
measuring was completed at 4:45 o'clock
and both yachts were warped out of the
basin.

The announcement of the time allow
ance In favor of the challenger caused
little surprise at the yacht club, as It
was the general belief that the Reliance
would prove considerably larger ajl
around tnan her opponent. Following are
the official figures:
official measurer of the New
York Yacht Club. As the result of his
measurements and calculations It was an
nounced to-n.ight that the Reliance would
allow the challenger 1 minute and 45 sec
onds over a thirty-mile course. It was
found that the Shamrock III was slightly
longer on the water line than the Ameri
can boat, but the latter .proved to have
nearly 2000 sciuare feet more of sail area
than the challenger. It was this enor
mous sail spread that taxed the Ameri
can boat so heavily.

CHICAGO, Aug. 18.â There was but one
good race at Hawthorne to-dayâ that be
tween Hargis and Glassful in the third
event, a handicap at a mile. It was
strictly a two-horse race, the other start
ers never having a chance. From the
head of the stretch to the wire the pair
had a desperate tussle; first one and then
the other was in front, and when the
wire was reached the public had to wait
for the judges to decide the winner. The
decision of the judges, giving the race
to the Corrigan horse, was not well re
ceived, many claiming that Glassful was
over the line first.
There was no development in the Holt
man-Corrigan controversy to-day. Holt
man was given an ovation by the spec
tators when he took his place in the
starters' stand in front of the grand
stand in the third race.

Experienced trainers declare that Irish
Lad was beaten by Hermis to-day be
cause Kcdfern, his rider, was taken by
surprise when Odom suddenly shot Her
mis through next to the rail and obtained
a lead which Irish Lad could not possibly
overcome, because the next three furlongs
were run in Sli 2-5 seconds. It would have
been suicidal for Irish Lad to make the
running when he had to concede six
pounds to Hermis. The riding of Redfern
ft emed to be in accordance with orders
from, the stable, judging from the fact
that the first three furlongs were run,
from the start around the turn, in 37 sec
onds. It was not until the straight run
on the backstretch was reached that
Odom eaw h!s opportunity and took ad
vantage of it. Shrewd trainers declared
immediately after the race that It was
reduced to a sprint of six furlong?, with
Â»iÂ« rmis four lengths in front of Irish I-id
iind the pace faster than at any other
period of the contest.
McChesney has fully recovered from his
ir.jury. and Trainer Taylor says he will
be ready to race within a few days.
Western turfmen are still sweet on the
chances of the big son of Macduff, and
rhould he go against the California crack.
Waterboy, and last year's king of the
Eastern turf. Hcrmis. the interest in the
rr.re will be unbounded.
SARATOGA, Aug. lS.-After the mighty
Hermis had won the Merchants' and Cit
izens* handicap at the Spa to-day his
owner. Millionaire E. R. Thomas, offered
to match the horse against any other
thoroughbred in America, at a mile and
a quarter, weight for age. This challenge
is directed especially against Waterboy
and MoCheFney. and the enthusiastic
young owner, whose long period of mis
fortune on the turf apparently has
reached the turning point, is not disposed
to place any limit on the amount to be
vi-a gored privately by the owners of the
animals in the special race, provided it
is arranged. Thomas' challenge hns
slirrcd interest In the project to decide
the championship of the American turf,
which got a black eye when the match
between McChesney and Waterboy fell
through because of the injury to the for
mer's hoof, due to stepping on a stone. It
is probable that efforts will be made to
bring Hermis. McChesney and Waterboy
tr.pother in a three-horse race, the
Jockey Club to put up a liberal purse.

Tromley begged for his life, the crowd
having placed a rope around his neck be
fore starting for the scene of violence.
After he had been tarred Tromley was
told to leave and return no more upon
penalty of harsher treatment. He went
to the house of Charles Stewart, a bach
elor, and, begging admittance, was given
coal oil with which to cleanse himself. He
then disappeared down the track toward
Portland.
HILLSBORO, Or., Aug. 18.-D. J. Trom
ley, who claims that he Is a private de
tective from Michigan, was last night
taken from the city jail by a crowd of
young men and treated to a liberal dose
of tar and feathers. For some weeks
Tromley has been stopping with a woman
who resides near the courthouse, and has
made himself very obnoxious to the la
dies who reside in the immediate vicinity.
He first claimed that he was a cousin of
the woman at whose house he lived, but
later claimed that they were married.
Tromley was dissolute, and* besides as
eaulting the Marshal one evening he was
threatened bthcrs with injury. He has
also been in the city Jail for drunkenness.
Tromley was wanted on a charge of dis
turbing the peace, as he had threatened
the life of .a citizen who was out of town,
alleging that he would kill him upon his
return. A message was sent to the house
at which he lives early in the evening and
Tromley came downtown accompanied by
the woman. When reaching the business
part of town he was arrested and placed
in the city Jail. Later a crowd broke into
the city hall building and between ten and
twenty young men took Tromley out of
the Jail, escorted him to the brickyard
east of town, stripped him and applied a
liberal coat of tar, after which they made
him roll over in a bed of feathers.

CLEVELAND, Aug. 18.â A mysterious
shooting which blotted out two lives oc
curred here, late to-night. A patrolman
walking on Broadway heard two revol
ver shots in the direction of Ashbel
street. Following the sound he stumbled
over the body of a well dressed man
about 24 years of age, with a revolver ly
ing near him. Close by lay the body of
an attractive young woman. Both were
dead, the woman shot through the right
temple, the man with a bullet hole be
hind the left ear. No one In the neigh
borhood knew either of them. The po
lice incline to the theory that It was a
case of murder and suicide. The bodies

TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 1S.-A Star special
from Nogales states that Francisco Mal
len, Mexican Consul at that place, who
has just returned from the City of Mex
ico, says there is no truth in reports that
the Mexican Government is arranging to
exclude Chinese from that country. While
it la the sentiment of the majority of
the people of Mexico that the Chinese
are an undesirable class of immigrants,
there la a treaty with China which runs
for several years yet which provides for
the admission, of citizens of China into
Mexico. Officials, however, are taking;
precautions to guard against a repetition
of the bubonic plague and will enforca
more rigid quarantine against the Chi
nese.
Consul Mallen believes that Mexico will
embrace the opportunity to exclude Chi
nese at the expiration of the present
tteaty.

SPOKANE. Wash., Aug. IS.â A special
to the Spokesman-Review from Buffalo
Hujnp, Idaho, says two little boys who
were lest in the woods for three days,
and who lived during that time on sal
mon berries and the raw flesh of wild
birds they caught, have been found by
some of the searching parties and have
been returned to their home here little
the worse for thnlr experience.
The bews are the sons of John Basin,
owner of a dairy. The eldest Is 10 years
old and his brother Is aged 8. The father
was away from home and on his return
he found both boys gone. He thought
nothing of their absence, believing they
were playing, until dusk, when he started
a search. The mother of the boys died
last winter, leaving five children. Three
of them were taken to the home of their
grandfather in Oregon to live.
Basin reported the absence of the boys
and searching, parties were organized.
Scores of men Joined in the search and
for days worked every foot of the heav
ily timbered hills in the vicinity. A3 the
days passed the number of searchers in
creased. Fears were entertained that the
children had starved. Finally a party of
the searchers found the two boys at a
point more than fifteen miles from their
home. They had wandered aimlessly
through the woods and over the hills
vainly seeking to find their way home.
Thcjr only food for the three days they
had been lost consisted of salmon berries
and the raw flesh of birds. They had
managed to capture a number of young
grouse, and having no means of mak
ing a fire- the boys had been compelled
to eat the flesh of the bird3 ra^. They
were tired, scared and hungry when
found, but no ill results are expected to
follow. The nights had been warm and
they did not suffer from cold and their
food, while meager, was ample and suffi
cient to sustain life. . There was a wild
jubilation in -camp when the boya were
brought back and returned to their father.

The commission awarded the company
damages for $523,178 64. The Salvadorean
Congress failed to appropriate money to
pay this claim. The State Department

United States to send a battleship to Sal
vador to compel the republic to live up to
the principle of arbitration.
This claim at one time -threatened to in
volve the United States and Salvador in

ing a corporation called El Triumfo. This
company secured a charter from the Gov
ernment for development of the port. The
Government interfered with the com
pany's operations and threw it into bank
ruptcy. The American stockholders ap
pealed to the United States to have their
rights protected and Salvador and the
United States agreed to submit the griev
ances of El Triumfo to a commission com
posed of Chief Justice Henry Strong of
Canada, Don Dickinson and Dr. Pacas
of Salvador.
The claim which the company, com
posed chieny of Americans held against
Salvador amounted to J323.178 64. At this
time the attorneys say they cannot make
public the amount which is to be paid in
full settlement of the claim until it is
acted upon by the Salvadorean Congress
but both parties are satisfied with the
agreement.

RETURNS AFTER
TWENTY YEARS
Bruces Island is in the center of the
Arkansas River, contains about twenty
five acres, and is densely covered by tim
ber and thick underbrush. Posses of cit
izens left to-day for the scene of the
trouble from Fort Smith, Spiro, Mnldrew
and Fort Gibson.
A few days ago two farmers living near
Wilsons Rock, landed on Bruces Island
in search of plums and accidentally ran
into a camp in which there were two ne
gro men and a white giri about 12 years
old. They made some Inquiries about the
girl and the negroes said she was the
daughter of a white man who was trav
eling with them and who had gone to
Fort Smith tor provisions. The negroes
would not let the girl take part in the
conversation and this aroused suspicion.
A watch waÂ« kept on the negroes for
two days, but no white man appeared.
On Monday afternoon a party of farmers
decided to investigate the case and as
they neared the island they were flred
upon by the negroes. One of the party.
Roland by name, was killed.
A ' sharp fight was kept up for some
time, during which the girl escaped from
the negroes and ran to the white men.
She was so excited that she could not
give any Intelligent account of herself.
She said, ' however, that her father was
not traveling with the negroes, but that
she had been stolen^/rom her home near
Fort Gibson, I. T. She has been taken to

Roland, the dead man, was a compara

the vessel. A boat was moored alongside the
whaler. One of the men cut the warp and
ehouted to Varnum that the boat had broken
adrift. In his hurry to save the boat Var
num laid down his rifle and ran to the rail.
As he ran somebody picked up the firearm and
threw it overboard. Six men then Jumped
into the boat and got away. As they rowed
from the whaler Third Officer James Mahan
emptied his revolver in their direction and
two of the men are said to have been hit. The
men were not recaptured.
Fitch and Bland had been living at
Needles. The last named is single and
Engineer Fitch is believed to leave a
family. Both had been in the Santa Fe
service for a long time.
SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 18.â Dead
Man's Stretch, as the section of country
between Needles and Kingman on the
main line of the Santa Fe has come to be
known among railway operatives, has
added another to its list of fatalities,
making:' the third in a series of recent
accidents where there has been loss of
life. As In the two preceding instances
the Santa Fe Limited is the sufferer.
An accident occurred this morning and
Engineer Fitch of the Limited was killed
by the bursting- of the locomotive boiler.
According to advices that have reached
the local office, the Limited east-bound
that left here last evening had made the
best part of the run through the stretch
before the accident happened. McConicho
was reached at 6:30 a. m. with Kingman
but four miles beyond. The last named
station is situated at the extreme east
ern end of the section that Is held In
dread by Santa Fe trainmen employed in
piloting the Limited train, and .Is the sta
tion for the newly discovered Arizona
gold fields. "While the train was nearing
McConicho the engine exploded, killing
Engineer Fitch and injuring Fireman
Bland so that his recovery is in doubt.
None of the passengers were hurt.
After the train had been held up two
hours and a half it proceeded on its way.
The engine is badly wrecked and the

DENVER, Aug. 18.â The sixth annual
convention of the National ." Building
Trades Council of America adjourned
sine die this afternoon after electing the
following officers for the ensuing term:
President, J. II. Maloney of Chicago,
first vice president of the International
Brotherhood o.f Electricians; general /sec
retary treasurer, H. W. Stelnbiss of St.
Louis, father of the N. B. T. C, and Its
general secretary since its organization.
J., C. Templeton, carpenter, of Fresno,
Cal., was elected sixth vice president.
Sioux City. Iowa, was selected as the
next place of meeting.
An amendent to the constitution was
adopted removing the right of the execu
tive board to levy on affiliated interna
tionals and nationals for strike benefits,
but it gives the board the right to levy
assessments of five cents per week upon
all affiliated locals. It also removes the
ten weeks' limitation of strike assess
ment and makes the levy unlimited as to
time. It also puts the conduct and dis
bursement of the strike fund in the
hands of the general secretary treasurer
of the N. B. T. C.
Trade jurisdiction in the slate and tile
roofing work in San Francisco was fixed
by the adoption of the following resolu
tion:
Liner Carries Large Number
of Passengers and
Big Cargo.
Disavows All Jurisdiction
Over Slate and Tile
Roofers.
Accident Occurs on the Sec
tion Known as Dead
Man's Stretch. *
period of occupation of Cludad Bolivar by
the revolutionary Government. â¢ The
amount exceeds $65,000. The merchants
refuse to recognize President Castro's de
cree abolishing Ciudad Bolivar as a port
of entry and decline to. ship goods via
Carupano.'. . V .
The Venezuelan gunboat "Miranda went
to the district of Nutrias, exacting from
the merchants forced contributions and
fines amounting to another $50,000. The
goods imported during the revolutionary
regime were confiscated and doubled
duties were imposed. It is reported that
President Castro has threatened to anni
hilate the commerce and expel the foreign
community of Guayana, on the Orinoco.
A reign of terror prevails throughout the
district, owing to the extortion, threats
and barbarities of the party In power.
The entire region of the Orinoco teems
with products accumulated during the
past two years for which there are no
adequate shipping facilities. The native
and German firms at Caracas appear to
be seeking to control the entire Orinoco
import trade. There is. no money in the
Orinoco country, and the distress is very
great. All the American river boats and
interests up the Orinoco are at a'stand-
Btill, being unable to move in consequence
of President Castro's determination to
destroy the transshipment trade in Amer
ican and European goods between Trin
idad and Orinoco river country.

CANNED FRUITS â Apricots, Cherries and
Lemon Cling Peaches have recently been ad
vanced. The whole market Is firm and In
favor of tellers, with prospects for an advance
in other descriptions. The California Fruit
Canners' Association announces the following
price list forS1903 stock:
General Merchandise.
NEW YORK. Aug. 18. â There Is no room to
doubt the operation of powerful and influen
tial forces in the stock market to-day. Profes
sional operators followed the movement and
made an imxtortant addition to the market.
Operations by pools were In evidence and ma
nipulative devices were easily detected for the
advancement of prices, but that the day's
market reflected a feeling of confidence over
the future that has not been shown for a
long time was plain to be seen. The feeling
was generally based upon ti,e conviction that
the necessary liquidation so far as It aQects
the securities market has been concluded and
that the financial conditions have been greatly
strengthened as a consequence. The move
ment of interior exchanges and advances from
interior money markets gave warning of the
early approach of the demand upon New York
for funds to move the crops. This demand,
however, seemed to have lost Its terrors. For
eign exchange advanced again and the price
of gold was raised again in the London mar
ket. London Is . taking protective measures
against demands upon her gold supply and sold
stocks freely In New York, but the movement
did not impair the newly awakened confidence
that with the outward movement of the crops
New York will be able to command . gold, o\v
lng to the heavy reduction of our indebtedness
abroad during the recent period of liquidation.
In this name connection the bulls on stocks
made much of the defeat by the Colombian
Government of the Panama Canal treaty. The
financing of the payment of $40,000,000 to the
Panama Canal Company and of $10,000,000 to
the Colombian Government, which would have
followed the adoption of the treaty, has given
Wal\ street much disquiet. It is supposed to
'have been a subject of concern to the Treas
ury Department at Washington also. It .is
assumed that the freedom from obligation to
secure exchange for the*e amounts will facili
tate the Jmjort of gold. The fear that the
; Treasury Department would be hampered In
any attempts to relieve the money market by
the need of conserving resources for these pay
ments is also â¢ removed. The larger political
and commercial bearings of the canal situation
were net considered. The payment Into the
local money channel cf C.toO.OOO made avail
able by the deposit of newly arrived Austra
lian gold with the Treasury officials at San
Francisco also had Its favorable Influence upon
the money exchange situation. A decline in
corn atnd wheat was given favorable interpre
tation, although the' Weather Bureau's weekly
bulletin was something disquieting. The Rock
Island authorities were supposed to be pre
paring for a favorable recejtlon for the new
bond issue. Old rumors of a Southern Pacific
dividend were revived. High prices for copper
end enlarged dividends on Amalgamated Cop
per were talked of among the speculators.
Larger dividends for various coal carriers both
anthracite and bituminous owing to the large
current earnings were widely, discussed. These
s.re but examples of the temper of the day's
talk and none of this talk rained any author! â¢
tatlve sentiment. All purchases 'â¢ of Inactive
stocks caused wide advancer just as small
sales caused violent declines dnrtnff the period
Neie York Stock Market.

the market was fairly active the recently re

: quoted range. Sweet potatoes were offering
freely and were In fair request at steady
' rates. Onions were plentiful and easier, the
demand belnr rather slack.
There was an active demand for vegetables
and the best offerings found quick sale at
steady prices. Good Green Corn was firm at
higher rates, but poor stock continued to
1 drag. Good sound Tomatoes sold readily at
I the appearing prices, but a portion of there
celpts came to hand In bad order, being soft
and overripe, and had to be sold below the
quoted rates. Lima Beans vere steady, while
String and Wax Beans wert very weak, ex

Squash cleaned up well and prices had a sharp
little advance. The other vegetables stood
about as previously quoted. '

CHICAGO, Aug. 1?.â The wheat pit showed
a fair degree of strength at the start, due to
the steady cables, the foreign markets being
up on reports of wet weather in England and
on the continent. There was fair commission
house buying early in the day, and after open
ing J^0%c higher at 82%Â©82%c September
advanced to S2%c. The strength was of only
short duration, however, on the decline which
followed, there was considerable selling for
short account and many stop-loss orders were
received. The break in corn, helped along the
decline, as did large increase in the world's
visible. 2,400,000 bushels, and extreme weak
ness prevailed the latter part of the session.
After selling down - to S0%ic September closed
at S05i"gsojie, a loss of l%c for the day.
Corn was rather dull, and ruled weak
throughout the greater part of the session.
After celling between 51%@51Â»4c and 52^c,
September closed %c lower at 51%@31iic.
Oats were up a trifle at the start on a fair
support from commission houses. The close
was I a trifle easier, with September off lie
at 34c.
Provisions moved up some at the outset, as
the result of covering by shorts. The smaller
run of hogs and higher prices at the. yard 3
also helped in the advance. Later liquidation
set In, the declining tendency being augmented
by the lower grain prices. September pork
closed lftc lower at $12 07%; September pork
was up-5@7%c at ?7 87%Cf-7 90, and ribs were
10c lower at $7 40.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

a brief opening advance, due .-to Minneapolis

could tell how much every way station
brought to the company in freight re
ceipts and how much a yard it cost to
oil his tracks. His fame soon spread,
and a few weeks ago ;.' an Eastern road
made him a handsome offer to leave the
Southern Pacific and so East. He was
reluctant, however, : to sever his connec
tions with the company he had worked
for all His life, and was told that soon
, the < Southern Pacific would be able to
give him a better offer. The result was
that yesterday Manager . Agler formally
notified him of his appointment as assist
ant to General Manager Kruttschnltt.
It is a common theory among railroad
men that once a man begins to- climb
the ladder of promotion in the railroad
world he generally keeps it up with leaps
and bounds. So it Is with "Bert" Worth
ington, as he is popularly called. He Is
looked upon as one of the brightest traf
fic men in the "West, and the Southern
Pacific officials are not slow to appreciate
his worth. He has been in the employ
of the Southern Pacinc Company since
he was a lad and he gradually worked
his way up through Individual efforts
to the oosltion" of company statistician
two and a half years ago. He was . then
placed in charge of the Coast Division
of the Southern Pacific. Under his' man
agement trains began to pull In on time,
better service was noticed and In a few
months he had the premier division of
the Southern Pacific system.

It Is expressly denied by men here who
are competent to speak for the party or
ganizations of New York and New Jersey
that there is any machine movement In
existence or In contemplation to bring
about Cleveland's nomlnatlon.Cleveland's
friends say he would certalnlji object to
such a movement or- to any semblance of
constructive politics in his behalf.
The statement In ex-Senator Smith's letter
confirms In authoritative terms the first an
nouncements published in the Eagle that Tam
many Hall will declare for Cleveland and that
New Jersey will vote for his nomination in the
national convention.
"I am sure that New York State will be In
