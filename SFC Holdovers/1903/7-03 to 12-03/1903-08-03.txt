SCENES IN THE REGION WHERE
THE? PRISON FUGITIVES ARE
BEING HUNTED. >
At dawn the weary watchers
were ready for action. Sheriff
Bosquit and Captain Swisler-were
in charge of the forces. It was
decided that it was not advisable
to storm the spot where the con
victs were supposed to be. It
was agreed to set fire to the brush
on the hill and if the convicts
were upon the hill to force them
to come out into the open or be
burned to death. It was planned
that when the fire got near the
scene of yesterday's battle a rush
would be made to recover the bod
ies of the men who had been
killed.
The brush was fired on the
vals of twelve paces in all the ra
vines and gullies at the bottom of
the hill on all sides. The hill is
about 200 feet in elevation from its
base and is covered with dense
manzanita . brush on the side
where the soldiers were ambushed.
Clean up to the top of the hill it is
seamed with canyons and gulches,
affording the best of protection for
men wishing to hide.

Rutherford had been hit with
several bullets. He had been shot
through the stomach. The bullet
passed through the body and came
out near the left shoulder blade.
Another bullet had passed through
his -right shoulder. Still a third
had hit him squarely in the middle
of the throat and had passed out
of the back of his neck. Any one
of the . wounds was fatal.
-Rutherford must have been
,wounded in the shoulder first, for

was found that he had fired every

XAJISAS CXJIES AGAIN
â¢ â¢ ' . IN GRIP â¢ OF A FLOOD
It has been established that the
band of convicts contained the
bloodthirsty and murderous negro,
Seavis. . D. W. Gipe, the watch
man at the Grand Victory miue,
said to-day that he saw a negro
among the men who bought eggs
and bread from him yesterday
afternoon at 2 o'clock. When
shown a picture of . Seavis the
watchman immediately identified
it as that of the negro he saw
yesterday. There were 'four in
the party. Two came and bought
eggs and bread and the other two
were standing off at some distance.
The two men who were in the dis
tance stood on a pile of mining
debris. One was a negro and he
wore a cap. Gipc could not iden

thirteen escaped convicts.
whence the convicts had fired on
us. I remained in the same spot.for
nearly an hour, and being satisfied
that the fallen men of our squad
were not alive Rutherford and I
worked our way down the hill."
A. J. Bell, one of the soldiers,
known as Lon' Bell, said :
"We struck the trail near the
mine at 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon and followed it up the hill.
For a quarter of a mile it was
clear and then we lost it. While
we were hunting through the
dense manzanita brush the con
victs suddenly opened fire on us
from about twenty feet and three
of our men fell. I fired ten shots
in the direction whence they had
fired on us. The convicts fired
continuously at us for about three
minutes. I have no accurate idea
as to how manv shots were fired."
Williana Burgess, an attorney
of Placerville and one of the posse
of militia who was ambushed, was
interviewed here to-day. He said :
"I was located on the left of the
squad alongside William Ruther
ford. We were going up the hill
through the manzanita brush,
when I heard Jones cry out from
our- extreme right thirty feet
away, 'Here they are, boys; get

The posses left the hill about
10:30 o'clock this morning, gath
ered at the Grand Victory mine
and departed for their homes,
tired out and weary from loss oi
sleep. There is no clew or trail
to show which way the gang of
convicts went after they had am
bushed the , soldiers. The only
thing now is for the posses to wait
for word that the convicts have
been seen, and once again they
will take up the trail.
An inquest was held on the bod
ies of Rutherford and Jones soon
after they were recovered. Coro
ner C. P. Winchell summoned a
jury from among the posses and
brief evidence was heard. A ver
dict of willful murder was re
turned by the jury against "un

were then sent to Placerville.

* SHERIFFS WHO HAVE BEEN TAKING A PROMINENT PART IN THE
SEARCH FOR THE GANG OF CONVICTS WHO OVERPOWERED

This community has been in a
state of wild excitement for the
last thirty-six hours. At day
break this morning those who
had waited through the night
were joined by every man, wo
man and child who remained in
Placerville last night and who had

hour this morning. Reports of

flames to-day, is likely to bear out
the theory that one of the des
peradoes has been added to those
who must eventually pay the pen
alty of their crimes.
This evening Deputy Sheriff
Cook and Attorney W. C. Burgess
left with a posse for the Pacific
House, which is twenty miles
above Placerville on the Lake Ta
hoe road.' The object of the posse
is to head off the convicts in case
theÂ£ go to that region.
The three convicts who were
seen in the canyon a short distance
from the Seven-mile House have
not been located. The posse that
went out after them could not find
them .and when they followed the
trail the approach of darkness
stopped the work. It will be taken
up again in the morning. Sheriff
Bosquit says, that he will have

them and the first foot trail that is
found of any of the convicts the
bloodhounds will be set to follow

quest on the bodies of the three
who met an untimely death yes
terday. This of course is a mere
matter of formality, as the verdict
must be "Willful murder at the
hands of unknown convicts."
Wild Excitement
In Placerville
Horror Caused
by the Crimes
of Desperadoes
Continued From Page 1, Column 1.
The flames swept through the
brush on the hill, and where a
certain portion of the manzanita
was not burned the posses hunted
to see if the convicts were there.
At 10 o'clock this morning the hill
had been thoroughly gone over,
and with rage and despair the
man-hunters were* forced to the
conclusion that the quarry had es
caped.
It is known that one of the con
victs escaped through the line kept
by two armed guards about 2
o'clock this morning. The men
thought it was a pig rustling
through the brush and the guards
did not' fire in that direction, as
they might have hit some of the
pursuers.
It is presumed on account
of the abandoning of certain
things by the convicts, such as the
field glasses and ammunition and
portions of their clothes, that they
must have immediately left the
scene of the battle after the am
bush and got away from the hill
before help arrived two hours
Xo blood stains led from the
convicts' lair, which was inspected
by the posses before the flames
swept over it. This leads the man
hunters to assume that none of the

glasses and the manner ill which

gang that broke from Folsom.
was in the party. On Monday
last he stole the field glasses, and
the guards who were the prisoners
of the convicts heard Woods tell
the rest of the desperadoes that
he would keep the glasses at all
hazards.
Woods also told Guard Klen
zendorf that "If you fellows ever
get the tin soldiers of militia after
us we will show them what real
fighting is. for we will ambush
them and shoot them to pieces."
Search of the Hill
a Fruitless One
also found and none of the val
uables or money on the two bod
ies had been disturbed, showing
that the convicts who murdered
them had been afraid to move
from their lair after the battle to
loot the bodies of their victims.
After the finding of the bodies
the posses entered the lair of the
convicts. There was no danger
in approaching it, for if the con
victs were still in hiding the ap
proach of the posses aided by the
flames must have driven the des
peradoes farther back on the hill.
In the convicts' camp the posses
found three hats, one of which
had a bullet hole through the
brim : three vests, a can of water
and two or three empty cans. A
few rounds of ammunition, two
revolvers and the pair of field
glasses stolen from Diehl's stpre
at Pilot Hill last Monday were
discovered.
The friends of Stringer, who
live at Hanks Exchange, will take
charge of his remains, but they
have not made any arrangements
as yet for his funeral. Coroner
Winchell will communicate in the
morning with the wife of Jones,
who lives in San Francisco. It is
likely that his funeral will be un
der the auspices of' the National
Guard. Deputy Sheriff Bosquit,
who was in charge of t T :e posse
that left Placerville yesterday aft
ernoon to follow the trails of the
reported convicts, says thai he ar
rived on the ground about the
same time as the posse oi militia
did. The two posses had gone in
different directions from Placer
ville to the Grand Victory mine
and approached the hill en differ
ent sides. â¢
When the Bosquit posse heard
the sound of firing they were pre
pared to give the convicts a warm
reception, and Bosquit says that but
.for the fact that he was requested
to bring his posse around on the
road to assist the militir. they
would hjrve had the convicts cor
nered. William Blake, one of the
men who shot at Stringer^ says
pected battle that was to be
fought at Grand Victory mine be
tween the band of murderous
convicts who had escaped from
Folsom Prison and the law offi
cers and those who had volun
teered to wipe the desperadoes
out of existence and to avenge
the murder of the two brave men
who last night gave up their lives
in upholding law and order.
The telephone office and tele
graph office here were early sur
rounded by eager seekers for
news, and every item that came
in over the wires spread like wild
fire through the excited commu
nity. Hour after hour news from
the Grand Victory mine was
eagerly awaited and discussed,
and as the minutes slipped by and
no news of the expected fight
had been received the hopes of
every one commenced- to sink.
Suddenly down the road was seen
a cloud of dust and a group of
armed and mounted men came
into view.
"What is-the news? What is
the news?" w^s the eager cry that
went up from hundreds of voices.
J< We have lost them. They
slipped from out* fingers right
after the battle," was the answer
of the manhunters.
This depressing information
was^ discussed with eagerness on
all sides and the general opinion
of the community was that no
steps should be left undone to
capture or kill the murderers who
are now terrorizing the whole
community. During the clay the
streets have been thronged with
people, not only those who reside
in Placerville, but many who have
come in from a distance.
Rutherford will be buried next
Tuesday by the Fraternal Broth
erhood Lodge and by the Na
tional Guard of Placerville and
the interment will take place at the
Union Cemetery.

the detachment of. mllKl* was
ambushed the undergrowth -was
particularly thick and the spot
is almost at the top of the hill.
Several fallen logs In, the brush
made progress of the manhuntera ;most
difficult. So dense is the brush that it la
impossible to see more than; twenty feet
ahead. . Â¦ '. : '
The outlaws had made their" camp at
the spot where the ambush took place..
Bread, eggs and the embers of a fire were
indications that the convict* had made a
meal at that point. The convicts harl rev
moved their vests and were lying around.
It 1Â« presumed that they sighted the mill- ;
tia when the latter were only a short dl3-
tance away. Two of the convicts must
have stationed themselves behind tree3
and one in a depression In the ground. .
The station taken by the fourth co-nvict
could not be located. .
The posse of militia had discovered the,
trail of the convicts on their arrival at"
the hill and proceeded to work their way
to the top of H. When, within twenty fe*> t
of the outlaws' lair W. J. Jones of thÂ»
posse cried out to his comrades. "Here
they are. boys." but at the very Instant
that his voice gave warning the convict3
poured a deadly volley of lead right into
the midst of the pursuers, . â¢ â¢
FALL AT THE FIRST FIRE.
Jon-s. Gill and Festus Rutherford fell
at the first fire. The other men in the
pursuing party quickly returned the fire.
The battleMasted about ten minutes., vol
leys being fired by the soiatera and tha
convicts. .* â¢
All of the militiamen with. the excep
tion of Will Rutherford were lying on the
ground. Rutherford remained- standing
throughout the fight. Gill, who fcad been
wounded, worked his way around to- his
comrades and was assisted later on to the .
base of the hill, where he was placed In.
a bed at the mine house.
The survivors of the, engagement re
mained In their position for about three-
quarters of an hour, never leaving tne
spot. They heard rustling in the manza
nita brush, but could not tejl what caused
it. . -
The six men of the militia had " ap
proached the lair of the murderers In
skirmish ordMr. They were strung out.
over a line forty feet long: Two of thÂ«
soldiers approached the lair on It* left.
and four worked up to it on' its right.
There was a distance of twenty feet be
tween the two small squad* of soldiers. :
The two men who were killed and the one â¢
wounded were in the squad that was on
the right of the lair. '.
GATHERING OF AVEUTGERS.
Word of the battle had rapidly reached
surrounding points, and hundreds of
armed men hurried to the spot. Throug'i
the long and anxious watches of thÂ« night
the manhunten prayed for the dawn so
they could avenge their comrades and
wipe out the murderers.
The unfortunate death of Philip Spring
er, a member of one of the posses, took
place on a small trail at the base of tha
side of the hill where the battle had been
fought. William Blake; another of thÂ«
posse, was with two other men when ho
saw Springer ahead In the darkness. HÂ©
called on Springer to halt, but Springer
turned and fired his rifle; evidently think
ing the men were some of the convict?.
The thought came to Blake, that Springer
was one of the hunted men. and he flre<I.
Springer fell dead, shot through the wrist
and stomach. Thi3 occurred at a little
before midnight, and it caused great ex
citement among the posses guarding the
hill. ./ â¢

of tho convicts who escaped from Fol
som prison, -were brought Into the* city
by Coroner Winchell. Ho also brought in
tho body of Stringer, who was accident
ally killed by some of the posses at "an
early hour this morning-. ". â¢ *.
A large crowd of people gathered In
front of tho Coroner's office, on the.* main
street, and when the funeral wagon
reached here almost every one In Placer
ville had gathered at the spot. The cof
fins containing the remains of the three
men were tenderly lifted from .the wagons
and conveyed to the undertaking shops.
It was necessary to guard the. doors to,
keep out the crowds who sought to view
the bodies.
Coroner "Winchell announced that after
the bodies had been embalmed and pre-*
pared for burial they could be viewed by
those who desired to do so. All day long
the bodies of the men have been -looked
upon by hundreds of people. Stern and
hearty mountaineers, tender mothers and
daughters and even little children have
flocked in solemn line Into the apartment
of death to gaze upon the faces of the
men so ruthlessly slaughtered by the,
desperadoes from Folsom. All those who
saw the bodies to-day .have demanded
that the murders must be avenged.
AFFECTING SPECTACLE. *
An affecting sight was witnessed" when
a member of the members of the Naftonal
Guard went to the undertaking shop to
view tne remains o.f their comrades.
Some of the members of the * squad had
stood side by side with Rutherford and
Jones when the convicts poured in their
deadly hall of bullets, that ended tire lives
of two brave men.
The companions of Rutherford and
Jones who participated In -the battle at
Grand Victory mine silently stood bÂ«sI8e
the trestle on which the bodies lay. They
gazed at the distorted features of their
dead comrades and their faces blanched
white, while- the muscles o{ their hands
knotted convulsively. Some of the men
were moved to tears, ami on leaving the
undertaking shop declared that they
would never rest until their comrades had
been avenged. ;,
All day long a steady procession has
passed in silent line Into the room. where
the bodies lay. It was not until late to
night that the last person who. desired to
view the remains left the establishment.
Coroner Winchell will hold the
inquest on Monday morning. *

LONDON. Aug. 2.â The stock market
has just passed through an uncomfortable
week, but With less trouble than was an T
ticipated. The failures were less numer
ous than were expected. Liquidations,
however, have been heavy and persistent,
while the low prices to which securities
reacted failed to tempt investors to any
considerable extent. The foreign market
is the only one, not sharing that general
depression. Russian, Japanese, Chinese,
Spanish, Turkish, Bulgarian and Argen
tines all showed advances. South African
securities were again depressed on the un
satisfactory- outlook of the'labor question.
The position of the American market,
which mainly follows the movement of
Wall street, is considered still too uncer
tain to induce healthy speculation.

But the troops made only a significant,
thin, blue line, compared with the 'vast
multitude around them. By 6 o'clock It
was estimated that 60,000 persons occupied
the vast ampitheater.' From the steps of
the basilica, which were black with those
standing or sitting, across to the- outside
of the square there stretched as : far as
.the eye could reach an undulating sea of
This culminated to-night in the appear
ance of a great crowd, which packed the
square of St. Peter's and presented a spec
tacle seldom seen even at the site of so
many historic ceremonies. Tho impene
trable seclusion which shrouds those en
gaged in determining who shall be at the
head of the Cathoilc church heightens
the feverish curiosity of those who await
ed their decision. Princes, Princesses,
Archbishops, Bishops, monsignors, priests,
well-to-do business menâ in short, persons
from every walk of life, from that of no
bleman to street beggar, talked c.f nothing
but Ia fumanata (the signal smoke).. Both
this morning and thia evening this was
the lodestone which drew thousands to
the square of St Peter's. There, for four
hours, with strained eyes and craned
necks, they waited for a tiny little stream
of smoke, so insignificant that it was al
most impossible to realize that a great
issue was involved in its fleeting appear
ance. \
FIFTY THOUSAND WATCHERS.
The scene at St. Peter's to-night was by
far the most impressive that has occurred
in Rome since the late Pope became ill.
After the fruitless morning ballot a belief
spread that a new Pontiff, would surely be
elected this evening. All roads during the
afternoon, therefore, led to the Vatican.
The regular Sunday leisure was forgotten
in the anxiety to see the new Holy See.
The streets converging into St. Peter's
plaza were black with the thousands who
entered the square with the ceaseless
regularity of an incoming tide. From the
barracks came large reinforcements of
troops, which marched across the piazza
and lined up at the foot of the steps of
the basilica, leaving only a small space
between the companies. In order to pre
vent a sudden rush to get Inside St. Pe
ter's to witness the new Pope give his
blessing to the Catholic world. â¢
A strong force of cavalry waa picketed
near by, to be called in . case of a riot
and more than 2000 soldiers were posted
In the square.
a vast multitude gathered
around St.. Peter's learned that the second
day of the conclave had been fruitless.
The conclusion is drawn that the strength
of the leading candidate remains qnbroken
and that no compromise candidate has yet
appeared. And there-is no indication of
how long thia condition of affairs will con
tinue. The prolongation of the contest
has aroused tremendous public Interest,
if, indeed, it cannot be called excitement.
Every trace of that apathy which followed
the death of the late Pope has vanished,
and instead there now exists a burning in
terest In everything pertaining to the elec
tion of hia successor.
ROME, Aug. 2.â No successor to
Pope Leo XIII haa yet been
chosen. From the smoke which
issued from the little chimney
on the Slstine Chapel to-night.
The mute signal, showing that the morn
ing ballot had been fruitless, was seen at
11:20 o'clock by many thousands, also, but
the watchers in the morning, owing to the
Intense heat of the â¢ sun, were compelled
to shelter themselves, behind the colon-
Then silence fell like a spell while the
thousands watched a tiny stream of light
gray smoke curl lazily downward from
the thin smokestack of the Sistine Chapel.
With no wind to carry it away, the smoke
hung heavily in the hot air and then
gradually disappeared.
For a moment the crowd believed that
the signal meant an election, for there is
a tradition that the Cardinals are allowed
to send uo a little smoke as a notification
of an election and much smoke In the case
of a disagreement. Any such hopes, how
ever, were almost Immediately dissipated
when a cloud of very thick smoke
emerged and continued for five minutes.
With many ejaculations of Â«iisappoint
ment the populace watched tho last trace
of. the ballots disappear and then dis
persed, although it was a long time before
the square of the basilica resumed Its
normal, quiet appearance. To-day's fail
ure to achieve an election .was a great dig
appointment-to Rome, and it Is doubtful
whether euch an immense crowd . will
again assemble unless the conclave should
continue until another Sunday. .
FUTILE MORNING BALLOT.
Suddenly, exactly at 6:40 o'clock, a sharp
cry aroseâ "Eco." Instantly the cry was
taken up by 50,000 throats and grew and
grew until the Immense piazza fairly
roared with "Eco," "Eco," "La fuma
nata!"
SMOKE SIGNAL APPEARS.
The rays of the sun, glancing from the
dome of St. Peter's, illumined the house
tops at the east end of the square, and
these also were crowded by anxious
watchers. Among the vast throng were
many German students, whose scarlet
clothing formed vivid patches of color.
When the hour of -6 struck a tremor of
expectancy ran through the multitude be
cause, according to yesterday's pro
gramme, the burning of the ballots or
the announcement of an election would
come within a few minutes. When the
quarter hour sounded the nervousness in
creased, and a large number of officials
of the Vatican, not engaged in the con
clave, emerged- to watch the concourse.
As the hands of the clock-on St .Peter's
approached the half-hour a rumor that a
selection had been made developed in the
minds of many into a certainty, and each
one momentarily expected some favored
Cardinal to be announced as the new
Pontiff. The crowd might almost have
been one in some American city awaiting
the result of a Presidential election, but
with this striking difference, that no soli
tary sign had come as to how the votes
had been going at the polls.
As the time p&ssed the anxiety grew
more intense. Not a breath of air re
lieved the sultry heat of the evening, and
scarcely a Bound came from the vast mul?
titude. Hundreds gathered below the
window from which the new Pontiff is to
bestow his first blessing.

beneath which many rested and waited.

PARIS, Aug. 2.â A congress organized
in the Department of Glronde to promote

.Several attempts to establish communi
cation with the conclave have been dis
covered In time. ' , " . ; . â¢
The number of telegrams 'for Cardinals
Herrero y Espinosa and Langineux, who
are ill, was so great that they made a
large package. The Spanish students,
who are anxious about Cardinal Herrero,
asked Dr. Lapponl through the wicket
how he was and the doctor replied that
he was a little better, but still confined
to his bed, and that the condition of Car
dinal Cretonl was unchanged. That'Car
dlnal is now filled with doubts as to
whether he should give a vote, being
afflicted with a sort of mania, due to his
Illness; that he is unworthy to Interpret
the divine will by casting his vote for
any one.
Cardinal Gotti, as far as known, is the
only one of the Cardinals who haa not
made some complaint about his cell. Be
ing a monk, he would consider demands
for comfort against his ideas of auster
ity. To a member of the Noble Guard,
who wished him success, Cardinal Gotti
replied:
"Thank you, but I shall not be made
Pope." >
Prince Chlgl, the marshal of the con
clave, is rather disconcerted because he
has no electrical contrivance by which he
can be notified from within the conclave
the moment the new Pope is elected. He
communicated with Monsignor del Val
on the subject and the latter Informed
him that measures would be taken to no
tify the marshal instantly when a decis
ion was reached.
Letters and telegrams for the Cardinals
were sent Into the Camerlingo, who does
as he deems best about delivering them.
Some of the Catholic newspapers also
were sent in, but no non-clerical papers.
CARDINAL HERRERO'S ILLNESS.
nade. , During the day the Austrian and
French Embassadors called at the Vati
can and were received by Prince Chigi,
marshal of the conclave. Cardinals Cre
toni and Vaszary continue to receive their
meals from the outside. The other can
didates who are indisposed are reported to
be slightly better.
There are thousands of rumors and un
verified statements afloat as to what oc
curred in the conclave to-day, but the only
facts which seem to be reliably known are
that the entire Sacred College assisted at
mass, which was conducted by Father^
Palmier!, , their confessor, and that the
"Veni Creator" was sung.
A great quantity of provisions was sent
In to the conclave to-day through the
wicker gate. Including 300 chickens. 500
newly laid eggs, many litres of milk,
crates of fruit, etc. All of the provisions
were thoroughly examined before being
allowed to pass through the gate. Forty
of the chickens were already cut open to
see that they did not contain contraband
matter.

Increase in State Organizations
From Four to Nine.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Aug. 2.â At

three Cardinals, including the two apos

bishops have decided in favor of the fed
eration.
Â¦Father Cantwell of Long Branch, who
presided, said the federation would prove a
great, bulwark afainst the rising tide of
"Infidelity. One cause of infidelity was the
factVhat part of the people preferred nov
*elty "and sentimentality to religion and
morality and that the great beginning of
infidelity was made with the so-called re
formation: that. some preferred to discard
some doctrine and others another, doctrine
until finally none of them believed any
thing. Divorce was another great- cause
â¢and it was strange that while the courts
held -that a contract of dollars and cents
could not be broken, they easily broke the
highest â¢contract, that of marriageâ the
very foundation of society.

Before leaving Queenstown the King
summoned Horace Plunkett, vice presi

and Technical Instruction for Ireland,
aboard the royal yacht and compli
mented him on his work in Ireland's be
half, conferring the honor, of knighthood
and presented him with a knight com
mandershlp of the Victorian Order.
The King will have a busy week. En
tertainments, either aboard the royal
yacht or ashore, have been planned for
each day. '
LONDON, Aug. 3.â In replying to an
address presented to the King and Queen
at Queenstown on Saturday, the King
said- that the Queen and himself "looked
forward to renewing In future years the
happy experience of the present visit."
This promise of another visit to Ire
land haÂ» given the greatest satisfaction
throughout the country and the morning
papers here all pay tributes to the ines
timable service which the King has ren
dered the realm by his tactful conduct.
The visit is commented on as a great
success, which will open up a new era
of prosperity for Ireland, and the ad
dress Issued by the King at Cowes yes
terday ia welcomed as a felicltious end
ing of a memorable journey. Even the
Irish papers are enthusiastic in declaring
if only the King will pay a yearly visit
or send the Prince of Wales if he can
not come himself. Ireland's troubles will
soon begin to disappear.
It is my earnest hope and prayer that these
and other means of national well-being may
multiply from year to year in Ireland, and
that the blessings of peace, contentment and
prosperity may be abundantly vouchsafed to
her. EDWARD, R. and I. August 1.
Copies of the address will be posted
throughout Ireland to-morrow.
The King and Queen received a great
reception on their arrival here. They re
mained aboard the royal yacht, where
they were visited this evening by the
Prince of Wales. Cowes is already very
gay with people who have come for the
week of yachting. Among those here are
many prominent Americans. The Ameri
can yachts include Mrs. Goelet's Kamaha
and the Margerita, under charter of
James H. Smith. King Edward's Britan
nia and Emperor William's Meteor, which
are to race during the regatta, are both
here.
COWES, Isle of Wight, Augr. 2.â The
royal yacht Victoria and Albert reached
here this evening and King Edward im
mediately ordered the Issuing' of the fol
lowing address:
To My Irish People : I desire on leavlngr Ire
land to express to my Irish people how deeply
I have been touched by the kindness and good
will they have shown to the Queen and my
self. Our experience on previous visits had.
Indeed, prepared us for a traditional welcome
of a waim-hearted race, but our expectations
have been exceeded. "Wherever we have gone.
In town or country, tokens of loyalty and affec
tion proffered by every section of the commu
nity have made an enduring impression on our
hearts. For a country so attractive and a peo
ple so rifted we cherish the warmest regard,
and it is. therefore, with supreme satisfaction
that I have so often during our stay heard the
hope exsressed that a brighter day is dawn
ing upon Ireland.
I shall eagerly await the fulfillment of this
hope. Its realization will, under divine Provi
dence, depend largely upon- the steady devel
opment of self-reliance and co-operation; upon
better and more practical education: upon the
growth of industrial and commercial enter
prises, and upon that Increase of mutual tol
eration and respect which the responsibility
my Irish people now enjoy in public adminis
tration of their local affairs is well fitted to
teach.

A dispatch from St. Louis says that
"William P. Osborn has employed an at
torney to sue for the treasure, as he
claims he is riffhtful heir to it. The
treasure is said to be worth $25,000. Â¦
Hasllp was enthusiastic after his second
trip and told the newspapers that he
would have a sensation for .them when he
returned from the Island again. But on
his third return he arrived in the night
and tooÂ«. the train for Philadelphia. He
engaged a hack at the wharf and drove
rapidly to the station. with his son. The
hackman who transferred them says the
two men had with them a ( small trunk
that was so heavy that it took both of
them to lift it and two canvas bags that
would apparently hold about eight quarts
each. He did not know the men, had
never heard of treasure hunters and hence
did not suspect anything. At the .station
It was learned that the man had checked
the small trunk to Philadelphia as ordi
nary baggage, that the trunk was heavy
and that the man had. explained tho
weight by saying that it contained scien
tific apparatus. Persons who have visited
"Warsaw recently report mysterious ac

SAVANNAH, Ga., Aug. 2.â Has the
treasure of the Starke family of Virginia,
known tn have been buried on Warsaw
Island, thirty miles from this city, in
1863, been discovered? There is certain
circumstantial evidence to hand which
indicates that the treasure trove has been
found and taken by J. H. 1 Hasllp, a Phila
delphia Junk dealer. Hasllp was much in
evidence here two weeks ago, accompan
ied by his son. He talked freely and gave
the newspapers some good stories of sea
chases, buried gold and the like. So talk
ative was he that the reporters made
light of his narratives, which he said ho
had from an old Confederate blockade
runner, whom he had befriended and who
on his deathbed confided to him the secret
of wealth hidden in the sands of "Warsaw.
Haslip came provided with canvas bags
and steamer trunks in which to trans
port the recovered gold and plate. He
made three trips to Warsaw Island. On
the first two trips he declared that he
had verified certain landmarks shown in
an old parchment drawing alleged to have
been made in the Libby prison, where the
old Confederate was a guard after having:
left the navy.'

tentions, and also to have made a full report
to his Government concerning the visit. At
the same time I>r. Herran furnished Senor
Velez with all the information in his power
and Introduced him at the State Department.
Bettor. Velez, It Is said, left Washington feel
ing confident that the I'nlted States would
pay the money to the accredited representa
tives of the Colombian Government and no
strings of any kind would be attached to the
payment, nor would the United States Interest
Itself in the uses to which the money would
be j>ut.
It is declared In the same information that
the uuriose of Senor Velez's visit was to as
certain whether the money would be paid in
such manner that It could be controlled by
the clique In power, and. further, that Velel
will "leave the fence" and join the "clique."
AcoorJinn to the Informant the opposition
to the ratification of the treaty has been
mere fllibusterine to delay action until Velez
could arrive in Bogota and make his report.
It, was feared by the party in power that the
United State* would have a string to the bonus
and be able to prevent the money being put
to a. use that would be of benefit to the
Government of Colombia.

the Canadian yachtsmen had brought
their defender of the Canada's cup, the

Upon his arrival there Sir Thomas was
greeted by Commander Jarvis and the
Canadian yachtsmen. After luncheon the
yachtsmen drank a toast to Sir Thomas'
health. In responding, he said:

friends across your frontier. If an error was
ever made It would be In favor of the for

' MEDICAL AFFAIRS.
The Grand Army committeÂ« on health
ard. medical affairs Is taking every pre
caution to. Insure prompt attention to the
visitors in "case of accident or illness of
any kind during their stay in this city, or
while' on excursions in the vicinity. Colo
rrel Window Anderson, surgeon general
JN'jitipn&l Guard of California, and medical
director for the Grand Army Encamp
ment, in his report to the committee,
urges the following arrangements:
â¢ Two surgeons to be In attendance at
headquarters. Grand Hotel, from 9 a. m.
until 11 p. m. each day.. Each detail to
last from pne to two hours, bo that the
headquarters shall never be without a
surgeon rea,dy to respond to a call. This
will require the attendance of twenty sur-
Ktons at headquarters each day. A simi
lar detail will be sent to the ferry depot,
â¢to the Mechanics' Pavilion durinjr the re
r f-ationa and entertainments, to the Grand
Opera-house during the sessions of the
Uelrgates, and to every place where thou
sands will gather for any special occa
sion. FuUy twenty surgeons will be in
:ine, distributed at equal distances, on the
two days of the parades.
From two to five physicians will accom
pany each excursion party to render med-
Ual aid in case of necessity. A room will

Dr. Andersen Is organizing the medical

Henry C. Dibble. J. B. Fuller and Soi
Cahen constitute the committee on hos
pital and medical affairs and they are In
defatigable In their endeavors to Insure
the best of care and attention to the veter
ans and their friends who come with
them during their stay In this city, though
not a single casualty may occur. These
precautions are taken to allay the fears
of Eastern visitors, who do not realize
that there is no danger of persons being
prostrated from excessive heat in San
Francisco during August.
The committee has also Issued circulars
for general distribution on all passenger
trains coming westward, In which passen
gers are cautioned against exposing them
selves to the cold and moist atmosphere
while crossing the bay. which makes
them liable to contract cold, especially
after traveling through the heated val
leys. These circulars will be generously
circulated among the veterans and their
frienda as the trains approach the bay.
Every precaution has been taken to secure
the health and comfort of the visitors
while in California.
2IEMEDRS OF THE HEALTH AND MEDICAL COMMITTEE WHICH
TVILi CARE FOR THE VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES DUR
ING. THE .GRAND ARMT ENCAMPMENT IN THIS CITY.
A dozen or more of the male guests
made their way to the office about five
minutes after the shock wearing assumed
expressions of indifference upon their
rather pale countenances, but otherwise
noticeably nervous, a condition that be
came more pronounced after they had
gathered about an old-timer who dryly
related how the temblors of the pioneer
days came near destroying the city and
how an old Indian squaw had predicted
that some day an earthquake would lay
the metropolis low.
At the Occidental, Lick and California
hotels employes were quickly dispatched
to the upper floors, where frightened
guests were awaiting to be pacified, and
in a very few minutes the guests had re
tired to their rooms to return to slumber,
or possibly await another shock. %
In only one particular part of the hotels
did the earthquake seemingly prove of
any special benefit, and that was the bar.
rooms, which were liberally patronized by
aroused guests until a late hoar, for nerve
tonics were in as popular demand as ice
cream on a summer's night.
The shock in its progress did not ignore
the hotels, the guests of which were not
long in recognizing the strenuosity of the
titanic visitation, and were by no means
slow in making for a supposed place of
safety. At the Palace there was quite a
commotion in the corridors, where lodgers
appeared in all kinds of habiliment, from
a full dress suit to the more modest and
airy pajamas, and pestered the bell boys
with anxious inquiries as to "what was
the matter."
The quiet of the Sabbath night was dis
turbed In more than one household around
the bay last night by a life-sized temblor,
which jarred the earth's crust in a man
ner calculated to leave no doubt as to the
identity of the subterranean visftor. The
shock, which occurred at 49 minutes and
42 seconds past 10 o'clock, lasted for four
teen seconds.
As recorded by the delicate needle of
the seismograph in the Chabot Observa
tory, Oakland, the heaviest shock came
first, the vibrations being from north to
eouth. After a moment's pause a second
shock, traveling from east to west, fol
lowed. ,

In private residences brlc-a-brac, crock

of the people report narrow escapes from

Lick Observatory reports the shock the
heaviest in the history of the place. The
indicator of the seismograph was dis
lodged and no record obtained. In San
Jose the shock lasted from 20 to 30 sec
onds and was from east to west. The
time of the shock, as given by Lick Ob
servatory, was 10:49:24 o'clock.
Large sandstone capping was shaken
from the Native Sons" Hall at Third and
San Fernando streets and also from the
Richmond building on Second street. At
the latter place a block of sandstone
made a hole a foot deep in the 6idewalk.
Windows were broken in the business
houses at various places about town', and
plaster was shaken down. The crockery
stores suffered severely.
Guests of Hotel Vendome and the St.
James rushed from their rooms to the
street and many refused to retire again
for some hours. A lodger In the Del Mar
lodging-house fainted, and it was some
time before he was re'suscitated. Tha.big
electric tower stood the shock well and
swayed but, little.
A resort Is current that the Mayfleld
Hotel was wrecked.
At the Garden Theater there was a
panic. People rushed for the streets, a
score of women fainted and the actors
and stage mechanics became ''rattled."
The earthquake did most damage in the
vicinity of Second and San Fernando
streets. The towers and chimneys of tlie
Louise building, the property of the Phe
lan estate, were wrecked and a great
mass of bricks and mortar thrown to the
street. Windows in the buildings were
broken. It was in this building Mrs. Lus
son resided, and her lifeless body was
found on the bed. She had been a suf
ferer from heart disease and fright end
ed her life.
SAN JOSK, Augr. 2.â The heaviest earth
quake since 1S63. if not in the history- of
San Jose, occurred here to-night at 10:49
o'clock. Damage was done to some of
the buildings and Mrs. Lusson, wife of
Dr. P. M. Lusson, died of heart disease
as a result. All of the lodging-houses and
hotels were emptied and almost' the en
tire population of San Jose deserted its
homes for the streets.

BUTTE, Mont., Aug. 2.â A special to the
Miner from Livingston, Mont., 3ays an at
tempt was made by unknown persons this
morning to blow up the large Northern
Pacific bridge crossing the Yellowstone
River east of tlii? city and wreck the
eastbound passenger train. The explosion
was terrific and broke windows In scores
of houses In the eastern part of the city.
No part of Livingston escaped a severe
shock. The big bridge was twisted out of
alignment.
The powder had been placed by inexperi
enced persons and to that fact is attrib
uted the escape of the structure. A large
hole was made in the central pier of the
bridge.
The Northern Pacflc Company has of
fered a reward of 51000 and the County
Commissioners $2000. There is no clew to
the miscreants.

The great Staples continue to attract attention and
ai> a rule* the outlook in them is cheerful. Heavy
rains in the Southwestern corn belt have given that
crop an iinproved outlook, and in Kansas alone the
relief of the drought is reported to have benefited
the State, to the amount of millions of dollars.
â¢Threshing returns from the wheat States, however,
*have beVw disappointing, and the expected bumper
cj*p has subsided to one of ordinary proportions.
Frosts and blight are reported in the Northwest, but
.jvhat damage has been done has not yet been defin
itejy ascertained.
A/ favorabTe feature of the past week was the im
proved export 'demand for our breadstuff s, consider
able Â«uantities of new wheat and corn being reported
taken for foreign account. Provisions continue weak
.un'der 'ncreasing .supplies, though the Western pack
ers -are showing more confidence in prices and are
rather* more disposed to support the market than
the 1 }' have been for several weeks back. The coun
try's, supply, of hogs, however, is steadily increasing,
.t& is to be expected after the high prices of the past
1Â£c\erai yeart, and with this increase in live stock the
â¢dured product will also increase, which means a lower
plane* of values from now on.
Industrial conditions are reported more satisfac
tory, and the" railroads are having all the freight they
.catT handle, \vith* complaints of a shortage in cars
aÂ£ain *being. heard. The earnings of the railroads
during the third week in July were nearly 14 per cent
larger .than during the corresponding week last year.
"jV&n. and steel buyers are still backward and these
'lines are by no means as active as during the feverish
times o.f thi* preceding three or four years. Some
districts, however, report rather more demand for
some lines. Hides are weaker, which impels shoe
manufacturers to defer purchases of leather in expec
tation of jofcr prices in the near future. In cotton
goodÂ«"prices are maintained and buyers of woolen
poods # are keeping that market reasonably active.
Shoe fhJRnients from Eastern manufacturing centers
are reported 32 per cent larger than "at this time last
year ahd' for the season to date 16 per cent larger.
This certainly does not indicate dullness in the boot
and shoe trade. T"ic distribution of general mer
chandise is reported heavy and the retailers and job
bers at! over'the country are reporting a very fair
c The "failures for the week were 190, against 198 last
year, and the bank clearings showed a loss for the
week of **.8;per cent, with aggregate clearings of
over, $2,000,000,000. The loss at New York was 7.8
per cent, while most of the large cities showed gains.
Our local condition continues excellent. The
Â¦wheat crop of the State is not turning out as large
as thought a couple of months ago, owing to the hot
<"ry weather in June, which caught the crop at the
maturing stage* -and shrunk the berry seriously in
some sections. But we shall have enough for our
ojvn use and probably some for export. The fruit
crop is turning out fair in volume and bringing good
prices, and the other products of the farm are also
tvrn'mtr out well, so the outlook is for another good
year in California. - ...
THE uniformly cheerful tone of commercial re
ports last week confirmed the almost complete
divorce 01 legitimate trade from stock specula
tion already pointed out. The recent severe decline
Ki'Wall street, apparently enough to shake commerce
VÂ» its center,* has thus far produced no visible direct
effect on general business, though of course it must
have had more or less indirect influence on some
lines, wWch may appear later on. The commerce of
the country lias proceeded on the even tenor of its
way, *?ndÂ° the" bad breaks in stocks of all kinds have
â¢Been recognized by' the financial and trading public
.as the natural collapse of inflated values.
'--The wonder is that these fictitious values did not
collapse long ago. Again, as already poinfed out, a
large percentage of the shrinkage has been on paper.
.Many hundreds of thousands of shares, which have
been figured in by 'statisticians in their computations
of losses, were stock held unsold by the corporations
themselves, and which of course were nothing but so
much blank paper as far as actual money is con
cer"ned. .Hence the actual cash shrinkage has proba
blt been gre'atly exaggerated.
â¢At present Wall street has become visibly tamed
down, money, both call .and time, has eased off to
lower rates and for some days the street has been
â¢timnterestihg Enough.- -There may be still more liqui
dation, and indeed it is expected; but as before men
tioned the general run of stocks have now got so
low that they are considered to have reached their
normal level, and the leading question among inves
iofs now* is_ whether it-is not a good time to buy in
again. A* lew days- more will probably settle this
question.
PERSONAL MENTION.
â¢ ASPECT OF TRADE CHEERFUL
TEETOTALERâ Inq.. Long Beach, Cal.
Teetotaler, a term applied to an abstainer
from all fermented liquors, originated
with Richard Turner, an artisan of ITes
ton, England, who. contending for the
principle at a temperance meeting in Sep
tember, 1833. asserted "that nothing but
te-te-total will do." The word was im
mediately adopted.
JAMESTOWN â Subscriber. Berkeley.
Cal. The three hundredth anniversary or
the settlement of Jamestown. Va.. will
fall on the 13th day of May. 1907. and
during that year there will be an Inter
national exposition under the direction of
the Jamestown Exposition Company. . or
which General Fitzhugh Leo was chosen
president.
SOME time ago Tom Johnson of Cleveland, in
announcing that he would not be a candidate
for the Governorship of Ohio, went on to say
that he deems himself better fitted for the office of
Mayor than the office of Governor, and will be con
tent with the Mayoralty of Cleveland so long as he
can render service acceptable to his fellow citizens.
It was rather a modest statement for him and there
has been a good deal of speculation as to the meaning
of it.
The statement struck the people of Ohio as being
a "dark saying," not only because modesty is not a
salient characteristic of Johnson, but because it is
well known throughout Ohio that his political ener
gies have been by no means confined to Cleveland.
There is hardly a county in the State where his in
fluence has not made itself felt through the medium
of either his oratory or his coin, and it has always
been understood that he was exerting himself in ,that
way for the purpose of getting elected Governor so
that he might have a good position to stand on when
reaching for the Democratic nomination for the
Presidency. Such being the view taken of his ac
tivity in politics, there was no little surprise when
he announced his modest desire to remain Mayor
of Cleveland, leaving the office of Governor to more
ambitious men.
As a result 'of public curiosity in the situation
there has been made a careful study of the relation
of Johnson to Ohio and of Ohio to Johnson by a
correspondent of the New York Herald. The corre
spondent discovers that the reason why Johnson pre
fers to remain Mayor of Cleveland for the present
is that he cannot better himself. He says: "A Re
publican majority of seventy or eighty thousand is
more than Johnson cares to go up against. He never
is interested in a. losing proposition. That is why
he has refused- to consider the Governorship this
year."
However, in declining to make the losing race,
Johnson has not been so contented in Cleveland as
he pretends. He has ulterior ambitions which show
themselves despite his efforts to conceal them. Evi
dences of his political plots and plans reveal the fact
that he is on a still hunt for the Senatorship now
held by Senator Hanna. He is working hard to
get a Democratic Legislature elected so that he may
assure himself of a seat in the Senate as the first
step toward; the coveted succession to Bryan as a
Presidential candidate.
As to the methods, the tactics, the characteristics
and the chances of the aspiring Mayor the corre
spondent says: "The Republicans of the nation
should not underestimate Tom L. Johnson's shrewd
ness and resourcefulness as a politician. He has had
an uphill fight in Ohio, but he has turned the city of
Cleveland from a strongly Republican town to a
strongly Democratic one. He is also courageous.
He violates precedent by doing things which a^timid
politician would not do. While abhorring bossism
in the Republican party he has assumed and exer
cised all the powers of an absolute dictator in the
Democratic party. He names all the candidates put
upon the Democratic ticket in Cleveland and it makes
no difference to him whether the candidate is popu
lar in the generally accepted sense. He* pays no at
tention to creed or calling or nationality in. the selec
tion of candidates, nor does he regard geographical
and other considerations which appeal to the average
politician. Above everything else, however, he gen
erally manages to put himself upon the popular side
of all questions, and he can make issues faster than
the Republicans can meet and dispose of them. His
declaration of war upon Senator Hanna means that
the coming campaign in Ohio will be a bitter one
and of national importance."
That then is the explanation of the modest state
ment of Mr. Johnson that he would rather be Mayor
of Cleveland than Governor of Ohio, because he
deems himself better fitted for the work. He is -by
no means so free from ambition as he pretends, and
before he finishes his scheming the nation may have
a tussle with him.

When the French cruiser D'Entreca3

tho ship was found to be considerably
overloaded, and^ suspicion was aroused.
The ship's company was landed and .the
vessel put under seal. A search was then
made and tho overloading . proved ti be

A shipbuilding high school has been
opened at Kiel. . The term is two years
and is open for naval architect students
who already possess some knowledge cf
the theory and. practice in shipbuilding.
On June 80 last there were flf ty-ona
ships of war under construction for the
British navy in the United Kingdom. Of
these twelve ships of 310,450 tona were
building in the dockyards, and thirty
nine of 171,150 tons at private yards. In
addition six vessels of 28,100 tons for for
eign navies were on the stocks or com
pleting under contract or awaiting buy
ers.
The British battleship King Edward
VII, which was launched at Devonport
July pS, Is the largest war vessel In any
navy, but only 350 tons larger than the
five ships of the Connecticut type buiU
ing for the United States navy. The keel
of the King Edward VII was laid March
8 last year and unusually rapid progress
has been made, during the sixteen and a
half months up to the launch. The weight
of hull, Including armor, is 10,075 tons, cf
which 6100, including 675 tons of armor,
was incorporated in the hull when the
ship was floated. The engines are being
built at the works of Harland & Wolff,
Belfast, and aro to develop 18,000 horse
power, giving a speed ot 18.5 knots. She
is to have fourteen Babcock and Wllcox
water tube boilers and six old-style cylin
drical boilers.. It is expected that the ship
will be ready for commission In the latter
part of 1904.
The approaching : naval maneuvers of
the British navy in home waters promise
to be of more than usual interest. The
home fleet, together with the mister
squadron, will endeavor to hold control of
the narrow seas, while the channel Jleet
will seek to devastate commerce. This
year large drafts of merchant seamen and
fishermen are to be added to the comple
ments of all the mobilized ships, and ef
forts will be made to establish the proba
ble value of torpedo attacks. Another In
teresting feature is that submarine boats
are to take part in the maneuvers and
will probably be attached 10 the channel
fleet. The value of oil as compared with
coal will also have a practical test, as
the battleships Mars and Hannibal and
the armored cruiser Bedford are to be run
by oil fuel throughout the maneuvers.
The British admiralty Has entered Into
an agreement with thirteen insurance
companies whereby a uniform and auto
matic method of insuring warships re
pairing at contract yards is effected. The
maximum sum is $2,500,000 and the longest
period two years. Sixty-two per cent of
the Insurance Is placed with the compa
nies and 38 per cent with brokers. The
rates for over $500 are: Thirty-six cents
for one month, 60 cents for two months,
80 cents for three months, $1 20 for six
months and 51 60 for twelve months. A
similar system of insurance is contem
plated for ships under construction at
private 'yards.
â¢ * ?
The controversy over the. design of the
two 13,000 ton battleships for the United
States navy still continues, the Board of
Construction being evenly divided, and
Secretary Moody Is in a quandary as to
his decision^ The senior member of the
board. Rear Admiral O'Neil, chief of the
Bureau of Ordnance, is in accord with
Chief Constructor Bowles, and construes
the act of Congress relating to the two
ships to mean as follows: "Two flrst
clasa battleships. CARRYING THE
HEAVIEST ARMOR AND MOST POW
ERFUL ORDNANCE FOR VESSELS of
their class, upon a trial displacement of
not more than 13,000 tons, and to have the
highest PRACTICABLE speed and great
radius of action." The emphasized words
are' theirs. On the other side are Rear
Admirals Melville and Bradrord, chiefs of
the Bureaus of Steam Engineering and of
Equipment, who contend that the Intent
of Congress is, according to their Idea, ex
pressed by emphasizing the law as fol
low'il: "Two first-class battleships, carry
ing the heaviest armor and most powerful
ordnance FOR VESSELS OF THEIR
CLASS upon a trial displacement of not
over 13,000 tons, and TO HAVE THE
HIGHEST PRACTICABLE SPEED AND
GREAT RADIUS OF ACTION." The size
of the ships was limited to 13,000 tons In
accordance with the sensible advice of
Admiral Dewey, and contrary to the
wishes of the Board of Construction.
O'Nell and Bowles now recommend de
signs in which armor and ordnance equal'
almost to that of 16,000 ton ships is incor
porated, which necessarily sacrifices speed
and coal capacity, while Melville and
Bradford contend for faster ships and
coal capacity, with a corresponding reduc
tion In weight of armor and ordnance.
It was rather an odd selection of ves
sels comprising the United States squad
ron which recently visited the ports of
Germany, France and England. Cnly one
of these, the battleship Kearsarge, de
signed in 1895, attracted any attention,
while the cruisers Chicago and Fan Fran
cisco, twenty and sixteen years old re
spectively, and the gunboat Machlas, thir
teen years old, belonged to classes long
ago considered obsolete. The London En
gineer, which still seems to believe that
no country except England can produce
efficient war vessels, commented on the
American battleship with its usual sar
casm, saying: "The Kearsarge is the
finest example afloat of the art of the fad
dist. * â¢ ? We may have some bad
ships in the British navy, but to contem
plate the Kearsarge may be balm even
when the worst of these Is about." The
London Times' naval expert, on the other
hand, gave a couple of columns July 11,
describing the characteristics of the
American ships- and fairly criticizing the
Kearsarge, and concluded by stating: "I
came away from the, Kearsarge strongly
Impressed with her great offensive and
defensive abilities, with a feeling of ad
miration for the completeness and the ef
fective character of her Internal fittings,
and strong in the conviction that In her
the United States possesses a ship which
any nation in the world might be proud
to own."
Rear Admiral Evans reports that the
monitor Monadnock In a recent full power
speed trial of eight hours averaged 11.78
knots an hour, and that for two hours,
with four boilers under forced draught,
'the speed averaged 12.1 knots. ; This Is a
decided improvement in a vessel which,
when completed seven years ago, made
only 11.63 knots on her trial. The engines
and boilers of the Monadnock were built
at Marc. Island under the supervision of
Chief Engineer George F. Kutz, U. S. N.,
and the recent performance reflects credit
on the officials and workmen in the navy
yard, as well as the present engineer of
the vessel. Lieutenant I. V. Gillis. to
whom the Secretary of the Navy has
written a complimentary letter. The Mo
nadnock was placed in commission Feb
ruary 20, 1$9Â»5. and cost J2.134.O54. The cost
of repairs up to July 1, 1902, amounted to
$77,300. an average of one-half of one per
cent of the first cost per annum. The
Monterey, built at the Union Iron Works
at a cost of $2,728,545, and commissioned
February 13, 1893. has cost in repairs $181,
330 up to July 1, 1902. being an average of
six-tenths of one per eont of the first cost
per annum.- Both of these monitors have
been In Philippine waters since 1S99, and
from all accounts the Monadnock has
! proved itself the better vessel.
China Is witnessing a return to the con
ditions which folloWd the coup d'etat
of 1898. Political discussion among the
Chinese, which increased during the im
perial court's recent policy of friendliness
toward foreigners, has suddenly stopped.
The plan of the Dowager Empress to ter
rify the reformers by the execution of
Shen Chien. which occurred last Friday,
has been successful. All of the liberal
Chinese, particularly those who have been
associated with the reformers, are in the
greatest fear of arrest and it is difficult
to find a Chinese who 13 willing to men
tion politics or Friday's tragedy, although
the latter is about the only topic of con
versation among trusted friends. The of
ficials are particularly dumb.
The affair is disappointing to the for
eigners, who had hoped that the Empress
Dowager's association with the ladles of
the legation would have a civilizing in
fluence. Prince Su, the most liberal of
the Manchu Princes, who in .uiarch last
issued a proclamation against Incense
burning to military Idols because it was
the chief rite during the Boxer troubles.
Is reported to have risked his office by
opposing the execution of Shen Chlen.
We earnestly hope that the authorities of
the civilized nations will give a timely warn
ing to this Government, which seems prepar
ing a Bast lie for the true lovers of China.
It would be- very discouraging to progres
sive Chinese If the Â»even reformers under ar
rest at Shanghai should he surrendered to the
Chinese Government and beheaded. Their writ
ings are, of course, offensive and Beditioui".
yet they should be punished as though they
had spoken In a like manner arainst the
American or British governments, which exist
for the welfare of the people. But the Gov
ernment of this land has become so corrupt
and has proved such a curse to the people
that our reformers deserve, the sympathy of
all enlightened men. who can perceive In what
a miserable state these millions are kept.
The letter concludes: "Is there any
hope for China except in revolution or re
bellion?"
PEKING, Aug. 2.â In connection with
the recent arrest in Shanghai of seven
Chinese editors on charges of sedition and
the probable decision of the foreign Minis
ters on the question of turning the editors
over to Chinese jurisdiction, a represen
tative of the Reformers has sent the fol
lowing letter to the press:

We need not follow Mr. Bullock in his review of the
lesser combinations; suffice it to say that the Stand
ard Oil and the Morgan interests combined controlled
not less than $205,000,000 of the $451,000,000 of the
banking capital invested in the city of New York and
in all probability obtain a similar proportion of the
business transacted. By reason of the combinations
vast financial deals are rendered comparatively easy.
Mr. Bullock cites a case where a $5,000,000 check
was drawn against a bank on an hour's notice and
"with a little skirmishing" was duly honored without
trouble to the bank. Thus the combinations play an
important and beneficial role in our industrial devel
opment. There remains, however, a question whether
the practice of combination may not be carried too
far and place so large a. percentage of the capital of
the country in the control of a few hands as to be
a menace to the general welfare. Mr. Bullock docs
not fear monopoly, but says: "It is unfortunate to
have the largest banks and their affiliated institutions
so closely identified with particular corporate inter
ests. This gives to the great/ captains of industry
almost unlimited control over other people's capital
and enables them to tie up in their own enterprises
banking resources that should be available for the
uses of the community at large."
Since that time there has been no serious attempt
to establish a national bank, though one was talked
of during the Civil War. In place of it there has
been of late years more or less discussion i of the ad
visability of permitting the larger banks of the coun
try to establish branch banks throughout the Union.
The arguments in favor of branch banking are strong,
but as yet they have failed to convince Congress and
no such authority has ever been given. ' It appears,
however, that in this case, as in others, necessity is
the mother of invention, and that the urgent need
for financial institutions stronger thah any individual
bank has forced the large financiers, "of the country
to arrange combination of banks sufficiently strong
to finance the vast enterprises of the time. The con
sequence is that we have now banking combinations
controlling much larger financial interests than were
ever dreamed of by the most strenuous advocates of
a United States bank in the early days of the republic.
In the current number of Atlantic Monthly, Charles
J. Bullock, in an article on "The Concentration of
Banking Interests in the United States," gives some
striking statistics of the extent to which these great
combinations of banks have been carried out in re
cent years. The review deals mainly with the situa
tion in New York city, but serves to illustrate the
tendency of banking interests throughout the whole
country, and may therefore be taken as an indication
cf the general trend of our banking institutions.
Prior to 1808 the banks of New York had been of
moderate size. Only two had a capital of five mil
lions, and the average for the clearing house institu
tions was less than $1,000,000; but to-day, says Mr.
Bullock, "the average capital is nearly twicp as great,
while three banks have as much as $10,000,000 and
one has $25,000,000. In 1895 the capital, surplus and
undivided profits of the fifty national banks amounted
to $110,000,000 and their deposits stood at $507,000,
000; in 1002 the number of these institutions had
fallen to forty-five, while their capital, surplus and
profits had risen to $191,000,000 and their deposits
to $1,057,000,000."
The increase in the capital and the business of in
dividual banks, however, is not so significant of the
drift of things as is the extent to which combinations
among them have been arranged. Reviewing the
larger of these combinations Mr. Bullock deals first
with those controlled by what are known as "The
Standard Oil Interests." That combination has for
its center "The National City Bank" and in alliance
with it are twelve other financial institutions, either
banks or trust companies. Of them Mr. Bullock
says: "The entire chain of institutions employs a
capital and surplus of $92,000,000, holds deposits
amounting to $377,000,000 and carries loans that ag
gregate $266,000,000. * * * The same interests
control also a second chain of institutions under the
lead of the Hanover National Bank, which includes
two smaller banks and the Trust Company of Amer
ica. * * * If now we combine the figures of the
two chains of institutions associated with the City and
the Hanover Bank, it Appears that within our first
sphere of influence there haVc been aggregated $108,
000,000 of banking capital, $474,000,000 of deposits
and $323,000,000 of loans. And these data it should
be remembered take no account of control exercised
over banks located outside of New York."
The second great combination is that controlled
by the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company.
That combination has under its influence three chains
of banks and tru ;t companies and through them con
trols a â¢ banking capital of $97,000,000, deposits
amounting to $472,000,000 and loans aggregating
$299,000,000.
Â«
EARLY in our history as a nation some of our
greatest statesmen and financiers sought to pro
vide for financial unity and security by the es
tablishment of a great national bank surrounded by
a series of subordinate banks in every part of the
country- They succeeded in creating the bank and
managed to sustain it for a considerable period, but
owing to various causes opposition increased with
the years and finally under the Presidency of Jack
son the issue was fought out and the bank over
thrown. - Â¦ -

those given in the colleges for men. The records of
its graduates therefore constitute a fair showing of
what university education is doing for women in Eng
land, and according to the reports of the inquiry the
results have been the very opposite of what has been
generally asserted concerning ,the tendency of the
highly educated woman to avoid motherhood.
The Newnham inquiry discloses that not only are
the graduates stronger and healthier than the average
woman of a similar social grade, but that their chil
dren are healthier and brainier than those of less
highly educated women. It is further stated that the
investigation of the standing of the graduates and of
their relations to society generally tends to establish
the doctrine that while intellectual men have nearly
always been the sons of intellectual mothers, young
women who have stood high at the university have
nearly always been the daughters of able fathers.
Thus the intellect of the mother seems to descend
to the sons, while that of the father goes to the
daughters. In a strikingly large number of cases the
graduates of Newnham who have won high "honors
at Cambridge are the daughters of men who in their
student days won honors.

DISCUSSION in this country concerning the
effects of the higher education of women has
tended to the, conclusion that while it mate
rially benefits the race in an economic and moral
way it inclines women to avoid the responsibilities
of marriage and maternity. It is true that the fac
ulties of Vassar and of Wellcsley have protested vig
orously against that conclusion, but none the less
most of our magazine and review writers have gone
on asserting the higher education of girls to be one
of the main factors in the diminution of the marriage
and birth rate among the American people.
The issue being an open one, it is .worth noting
that British authorities add their voices to the pro
test of Vassar and Welleslcy against the prevailing
belief. Recently an inquiry was made by the princi
pal of Newnham College for the purpose of finding
out what had been the results of university training

After this there was the presentation by
E. R. Moss, past grand of Magnolia
Lodge, on behalf of the committee, to A.
M. Brand, the retiring president, of a
beautiful fob charm, in gold and enamel,
with a diamond In tho center of the all
seeing eye, In recognition of the faithful
ness in which he discharged the duties
of his office during his term. There was
a response of thanks, then congratula
tory speeches by Past Presidents Watson,
Doyle and others, after which there was
an adjournment to the banquet hall of the
building, where a most tempting dinner
was served. The new president was the
toastmaster and after the dinner had been
discussed there was a call upon the
prominent members of the committee and
past officers to respond. Toasts were re
sponded to by the vice president, H. W.
Osthoff; the past president, A. M. Brand;
the other officers of the committee, and a
number of Odd Fellows who have In tho
paÂ»t served in various capacities on tho
committee.
PRESENTED WITH CHAEM.
After the election the officers were duly
installed and the new president was hand
ed a watch that had been the property of
the committee for more than twenty
years and which during that time had
never been wound up, for the reason that
the main spring Is broken. The hands
point to the hour of ten, the time when
the meeting is to be called to order every
Sunday morning. He was informed that
it was the duty of every president to wear
that watch in order to remind him of the
hour when he Is to call the committee
to order.
At the close of the business of the day,
which, in addition to the reading of the
reports, consisted of the presentation of
the reports of the several committees who
visited the sick under the care of the
relief committee, of what had been done
for the care of widows and orphans, there
wis the election of officers for the cur
rent term. The election resulted in the
choice of XV. I. Brobeck, Assistant City
and County Attorney, president, in place
of Vice President J. E. Reardon, who
would have been advanced to the presi
dency, but who was forced to decline be
cause he had accepted an office In another
organization which will take him away
from the city for a great portion of the
present term. The, new president Is a
member of Farnsworth Lodge. H. W.
Osthoff of Fidelity Lodge, one of the most
popular men in the order at this time,
was chosen for vice president. James
Francis Nichols of Templar Lodge was
unanimously re-elected secretary and H.
F. Neunaber of Yerba Buena Lodge was
chosen treasurer, being re-elected without
opposition.
The reports that were presented show
that during the term that expired yester
day the committee attended to 325 cases,
thirty more than the previous term, and
after due Investigation each case re
ceived proper attention and financial as
sistance was extended wherever such was
necessary. The receipts during the six
months amounted to $10,142, dnd the dis
bursements for the relief of Oie sick and
distressed Odd Fellows from parts of the
country outside of San Francisco to $10,
492, or $350 in excess of the Income, which
had to be drawn from the surplus on
hand. This report shows that during the
last term $530 45 more was expended In re
lief than during the previous term.
The reports also showed that there was
paid from the friendship fund in the na
ture of loans to members of the order
who were financially stranded, the sum
of $340 50. The greater portion of this
was returned and in addition there were
a number of donations from grateful
members who had been assisted and who
thought that their little donations would
assist others, who, like themselves, at
some time might be in need of aid in a
monetary way. The contributions to thia
found amounted to $427 GO.

CANTON. Mass., Aug. 2.â Hiram H.
Poole, a baker, was stabbed to death to
night in Sherman street by one of three
Italians. His assailants fled after the
murder, and have not been arrested. There
was a dispute of some kind and resident*
of the neighborhood were startled by
Poole's cries for help. He was stabbed
three times, twice in the neck and once
in the breast, but managed Jo stagger
Into Washington street, a distance of 500
feet, where he fell dying on the street.
Dispute Ends in Murder.
patrons, and In ten minutes' time the in
terior of the Russ House was as peaceful
as it usually Is at midnight. It is believed
that some guest, or possibly an employe
of the hotel, carelessly threw a lighted
cigarette behind the trunks and that It
eventually ignited the carpet and wood
work. The damage was nominal.
Gumpeoy in his conversation gives no
evidences of mental lncompetency and the
nurses who attended him at the McNutt
Hospital say that he showed no signs of
Insanity while there. Attendants at the
Emergency Hospital give like reports of
his conduct while at that Institution.
Gumpeoy eays that the reason he was
taken from the McNutt Hospital was that
he did not receive an expected remittance
from New York and was unable to pay
his bill to Dr. Schick.
He was visited yesterday at the hospital
by a Mr. and Mrs. Terry, who said they
were well acquainted with the young man
and his relatives. They told the attend
ants that his brother was a wealthy New
Yorker and they scoffed at the idea that
the young man was insane.
Dr. Schick, who ha'd charge of the pa
tient, is not known to the medical frater
nity of this city. It is said that he has
come here only recently from I<os An
geles. When Gumpeoy inhaled the over
dose of gas he was rooming at 334 Golden
Gate avenue. He ia entirely without
funds.
Considerable mystery surrounds the
cause of the detention In the insanity
ward of the Central Emergency Hospital
of a young man named Albert Gumpeoy,
who was taken to that institution Satur
day afternoon by a Dr. Schick, who Is
said to have sworn to a complaint that
his patient was mentally unbalanced.
Previous to his incarceration In the Insane
ward Gumpeoy was a patient at the Mc-
Nutt- Hospital, where he was treated by
Dr. Schick for the effects of gas asphyx
iation. \ Â¦;'>â¢ 'Â¦'.. :;'<-l
OYSTER BAY. N. Y., Aug. 2.-Profane
and abusive language was directed to
ward President Roosevelt and his family
to-day as they were driving up to Christ
Church to attend the morning service.
The offender was a resident of Oyster
Bay, McCann by name. He was hustled
away from the church unceremoniously
by secret service men.
Accompanied by Mrs. Roosevelt and
two of her children, the President had
driven to the village from Sagamore Hill
to attend church, as is his custom on
Sunday mornings. Directly in front of
the church McCann was walking along
the roadside, pushing a bicycle. As the
President's carriage was about to turn
Into tHe driveway leading to the church
grounds It passed McCann. McCann.
with an oath, demanded to know whether
the President wanted the whole road.
This was followed by abusive and pro
fane language.
As the carriage stopped at the church
door the President, greatly annoyed at
the insult offered to Mrs. Roosevelt and
the children, alighted and directed the at
tention of the secret service officers to
the man and ordered that he be compelled
to leave the vicinity of the church. Mc-
Cann hesitated when ordered to move on,
but as an officer was about to stimulate
his movements he. sprang upon his wheel
and rode away rapidly.
While the Incident was annoying to the
President and his family, it is his desire
that no action be taken against the man.

There can be no doubt that the planting and
growing of this tree as an honor to the patri
otic dead and to his memorable deeds will
contribute its, influence In serving not only to
make American citizenship more dltrnlfled and
honorable, but also to maintain and perpetu
ate for all time to come the union and au
thority of the I'nlted States of America.
Past Post Commander J. Murray Bailey
followed with the reading of "American
Order of Nobility" and memorial verses
to General Thomas. Officer of the Day A.
J. VlfTing read appropriate selections from
the Scriptures and the â¢â¢Proclamation of
Peace." Chaplain C. II. Osborn delivered
the prayer of dedication, and the veterans
joined "in singing '"'We Are Tenting To
night on the Old Camp Ground."
Mrs. J. Murray Bailey recited "Thomas
at Chickamaupa." after which the post
commander dedicated the tree according
to the ritual. The comrades each cast a
handful of sod around the roots of the
tree, and the services ended with the
hymn "America."
It is a memorial tree, pig-nifleant of brave
nnd loyal obedience to the command of the na
tion always and everywhere, since the obli
gations of citizenship are not restricted to time
or place or to the conflict of arms. It gives
encouragement for the future, since the recog
nition and approval It Klves of patriotic fidelity
and bf-roism -will be an Incentive for the dis
play of public valor and virtue in all coming
tlmÂ»$.
Mrs. Wilson, the donor, made the pre
sentation address, and in reply Senior
Vice Commander Selden Sturges accepted
the gift In the following speech:
In the name of Â«.Jeorg<> H. Thomas Post and
my comrades of the Grand Army of the Re
public, representing as they do all Â«oldierÂ» and
Bailor* who defended the Integrity and Au
thority of the nation. I thank you for the rift
of this beautiful tree and its tablet, to stand
a memorial of the post and its namesake, I
trust, for tenerations of time to come. Its
vc-y Filence i* impressive. Without articulate
speech, it in eloquent. It need* few word*. It
is itself an oration. It assures us and all who
virlt this sacrfd spot that the illustrious and
intrepid Thomas is held in remembrance with
all those tiead who Rave their livea for the
'security of the citizen and the union of the
States.
The planting and dedication of a tree do
nated by Mrs. Sarah H. Wilson to the
memory of General George II. Thomas by
George H. Thomas Post No. 2, Grand
Army of the Republic, occurred yesterday
afternoon at the Fan Francisco National
Cemetery at the Presidio. The ceremo
nies were elaborate and interesting, and
a large number of the members of the
post and their friends witnessed the exer
cises.
A few minutes after 6 o'clock last even-
Ing a cry of. "fire"' in the Russ House
startled the guests of that, hostelry, and
for a time a small panic prevailed -within
the walls of the establishment. The ma
jority of the guests had just finished their
dinner and were in their rooms when one
of the lodgers was heard rushing along
an upper floor toward the stairway shout
ing "flre" at ths top of his voice.
The warning was heard by Manager
Newman and the bell boys in the hotel
office on the first floor, and they were
quick to realize the expediency of prompt
action. Unfortunately for their purpose,
however, they could not immediately lo
cate the man who had sent up the cry.
and It was several minutes before. they
discovered that. the cause of the alarm
was on the top floor. Reaching that part
of the hotel they found the carpet and
woodwork behind two trunks Jhat were
standing in a hallway burning. A still
alarm was sent in to the flre patrol, which
quickly responded, and in a few minutes
the blaze was extinguished.
Meanwhile, however, the greater num
ber of the guests had rushed wildly from
their rooms and were frantically search-
Ing for flre escapes and other means of
exit from the hotel, of which there are
many. Not a few of the guests made a
hurried appearance partly disrobed, and
one male lodger, who happened to be
bathing at the time the cry of "flre" was
heard, abandoned all thought of modesty
and for a minute or so played an unap
preciated role of Adam along the corridor
on which his room is located. He was
suddenly brought to a realization that
modern ethics, even in such trying times
as a panic in a city hotel, demand that
guests of the latter conform to dress
rules, and he hastily retreated to his room
to meditate at his leisure over the ridicu
lous spectacle he had furnished for the
other guests of the Russ.
With the assistance of his help Manager
Newman finally quieted the anxiety of his

A POLISH CUSTOM j
By KOWALSKI , i
9 ~ Â¦ ' Â¦ i ]
Call Art Supplement, August 9, 1903 j
"The "Wedding Party," by Kowalski, illustrates the Polish form of a j
custom which exists in almost every civilized and many semi-civilized /; :Â¦Â¦,.'<
countries. \ ]
In the agricultural districts of Poland, where horses are most neces- '
sary to cover long distances over the broad steppes, it is most natural I
that the wedding procession should take the form of a "promenade en j
voiture." It is such a scene, full of life and gayety, that is % depicted in '
the picture reproduced in .the art supplement. Laughing faces, bright i^\
color and lively movement combine to give the scene a character of joy- '
ousness and a "go" seldom found in pictorial representations. |
â¢ "The Wedding Party," which is at present exhibited at the Chicago J
Art Institute, is the property of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Bosenbaum of Chi- i
cago, and is held in high favor. * j

It is to be regretted that a great number
of these writing ladles affect a rather vul
gar taste and luxuriate in picture of in
delicate and ambiguous love affairs, with
details calculated to arouse sensation
rather than satisfy the demands of the
psychologist and the poet. Some of them
indeed are very bright and clever, but
others seem to consist of mere "nerves"
and "senses." The question principally is
one of culture, or rather want of culture.
These ladies lack moral, and, in a certain
sense, intellectual culture, too. Strong
protests have been made by their own
sex against the deterioration of woman
hood Involved in their explanations on
dubious female characters. Talent varies,
and it happens that small offenders are
hanged where great ones are let off, but
the fact is one of many proofs how bad
an . educator naturalism has been.â The

According to the report of the tenement
house committee. New York City, below
the Harlem, Is the most densely populat
ed city in the world. In 1S95 Manhattan
had 143.3 population to the acre. Paris
comes next, with a density of 125.2 per
acre .and Berlin follows with 113.6. Ac
cording to estimates based on the above
total, one district In the Eleventh Ward
cant&lned as many as 9S6.4 persons to
every one of Its thirty-two acres. It may
be that these figures are equaled in sora-:
parts of the world, but the information at
hand indicates only one district approach
ing thisâ a part of Bombay, which had In
1SS1 a population of 756 to the acre, in an
area of forty-six acres.
It should be noted, however, that thÂ»
Asiatic density is much more oppressive,
as it is spread over much less floor space,
the New York buildings having more sto
ries. The densest small section of Eu
rope seems to be the Josefstadt, or
Prague, with a population of 485.4 to the
acre.

The only tallies of the game came
through in the third round. Dummy Hoy
opened it with a saucy slap that was a
bit too torrid for Moose's liking. Wheeler
was there with a sacrifice and Smith with
a hit, sendine the little man around as
far as thÂ« third sack. â¢>.
Dillon hit a high one that took a course
in the direction of short center. O'Hara
started to corral it, but stopped Just an
instant too soon. While he was busily en
gaged saying a few things for his own
benefit the Dummy quietly slipped home.
Then Smith became absent-minded' and
was caught off second. Soon after Cra
vath tore off a hit and so did Ross, and
their combined strength sent Dillon home.
In their half of the same round the
Cripples all but accumulated a few.,Gor
ton singled, Messerly did likewise and
Uncle Peter was hit by the pitcher. Â¦Â¦; The
sacks could not hold another and no man
was yet put out. The fans yelled and the
'Twas mainly through the efforts of that
stately and dramatic personage, Mr.
Wheeler, *dnce of Philadelphia and later
of Syracuse, that the game wa3 landed
safely In the clutches of Mor!ey. Mr.
Wheeler was anxious for another whirl In
his old-time place on the slab. Ills wish
was gratified, and hence the Cripples went
home without experiencing the delight of
having any of their number touch the
home plate.
For a man who has not entered the box
for months the performance of Wheeler
was nothing short of a raging .sensation.
He did not allow a single batter to amble
to the first bag on called balls, and al
lowed them but three scattered safe hits.
In addition, seven of the' Cripples perfor
ated the sunlight. The fans will agree
that Wheeler pitched one of the best
games of the season.
Dr. Mosklman also .performed well,
though at times he was buffed end cuffed
around in a manner to make him think of
better days he had enjoyed on the slab.
Ten times the Angels found him easy, but
poor work on the bases and good work on
the part of the Cripple fielder* kept the
runs down to one pair. ' . /

THE first Angel-Cripple baseball se
ries has become a matter of his
tory. The fans will gossip for
some time over the question of
how Peter's Infirm followers took
two out of six games from the leaders. On
Saturday they v.on and at Oakland
yesterday while the day was but a few
hours old they landed again, 7 to 6. The
afternoon fight brought joy to the hearts
of the southerners and the result was 2
to 0.
Good ball, a little poor ball and some ex
citing ball was on the cards during the
Recreation Park contest. The Angels were
far the better In every department of the
game and they won just because -it was
their due. In hitting, they were there all
the time. No man on the team erred till
the last spasm, when the eloquent Mr.
Dillon made a vain attempt to scoop up a
low one from brother Joe at second.

TO THE DRAW BRIDGE
More Than a Dozen Pleasure Craft
Hailing From Tiburon Drop An- "
chor in Petaluma Creek.
The fleet of the Corinthian Yacht Club
returned to moorings yesterday after
noon after a successful and pleasant
cruise to Petaluma drawbridge.
The pleasure craft left Tiburon at va
rious times on Saturday afternoon and
dropped anchor below the drawbridge
during the evening. The yawl Frolic left
the cove rather late and came to anchor
in Petaluma Creek about a mile below the
rest of the fleet. Yesterday morning she
got sail up and Joined the fleet, which in
cluded the flagship Edna, the sloops
Speedwell, Emma, Meteor. Mlgnon.
Amlgo, Cupid, Freda, Aeolus, Genesta,
Presto and Truant.
The yachts began to move at about 9:30
o'clock yesterday morning, and by 11
o'clock; the whole fleet was under way.
"When the open bay was reached there
was a stiff breeze, and the ebb tide
caused a considerable sea. Oft McNeara
Point the wind grew light, and In Rac
coon Straits had almost dropped. All
managed, however, to reach moorings
without mishap, though the sloop Freda,
flying the new flag of the port captain,
was towed in.
Many boats of the San Francisco and
California yacht clubs cruised In the up
per bay yesterday or dropped anchor In

Several tried to dance with him. but none

Thousands of practical Instances could
be given to show the value of improved
varieties of corn. For instance, one
Southern Illinois farmer, more progres
sive than the rest, was Induced to secure
enough improved seed to plant 300 acreg
as a result of his study of corn in the
Illinois College of Agriculture. These 300
acres outylelded all of the other fields on
his farm more than thirty bushels per
acre; and. so far as could be determined,
the fields of that entire section yielded
about thirty bushels per acre. This In
crease of yield meant a total gain of, about
9000 bushels, which represented a cash
value of about $4000 that season. As this
increase did not represent an. increased
cost of production, - the gain was pure
profit. In another case, a farmer In Cen
tral Illinois became Interested In improv
ed corn seed through the school of corn
judging in the Illinois Agricultural Col
lege. He secured enough seed, grown by
a corn breeder, to plant eighty acres. As
a result he raised almost twenty-five
bushels more per acre on this field than
where the ordinary seed was planted.â

Mr. Lueddeckens has recently" pablished
a brochure on the subject of right and
left handedness. The explanation for the
phenomenon In any person is traced* to
the pressure of his blood In two halves
of his brain. He concludes that for right
handed subjects there is an excels of
pressure In the left half of the brain, .ac
companied by an excess of excitability
and of vitality in all those par^a.'of the
body dependent on the left brain. For
left-handed people the reverse la true. He
notes the singular fact that, in his ex
periences, left-handed folk are 'apt to
sleep on the left side. The pressure of
the blood in the brain of a living person
is not so readily measured, and the auth
or Is forced to base hl3 conclusions o*n
deductions like the following: TJiat side
of the brain with the greater blood-pres
sure will be the best nourished and the
parts of the body dependent upon that
side will show greater sizeâ the ear, tho
globe of the eye. etc.; the differences be
tween the weights of tho two halves of
the brain can be measured after dÂ«ath;
we know the brain center for language
to be localized in the left half; and for
right-handed people the excitability of
the right side of the body is the greatest,
and it corresponds to the left brain. His
proofs are not complete, but the theory,
is promising and simple, though it still
lacks convincing demonstration.â N. Y.

"The master embraced him. congratu

The master as soon as he learned that it

and five years later sola them at a great
profit, for everybody that tasted the new
drink loved it
"In time the secret leaked out. Brewer

the lying process, and they called the
new drink 'lying' or iager' beer, for
'lager', means 'lying.' as you know.

Is the story as ray grandfather handed It
down to my father: A saddler of the
German town of Bamberg sent his ap
prentice one morning in the Middle Ages
for a bottle of the beer they used In
those daysâ a vile beer that was drunk
as soon as it was brewed. The appren
tice bought the bottle, and on the way
home with it met a practical joker. The
joker said to him:
" 'Your boss is looking for you. He says
you have spo-.ed three days' work, and
he is going to baste you with a cart

"At this news the apprentice was so
scared that he buried the bÂ«er under a

became an officer and got the cross of
honor. Then he thought he would return

Reports that the entomological depart
ment of the University of California is
now receiving from the various counties
in the State where the grasshopper has
done considerable damage show that the
pest is not one-quarter as severe this
year as it was last.
Professor C. W. Woodworth attributes
this abating of the plague in a largo
measure to the campaign ttyt was under
taken last year. At that time the hop
pers were destroying many thousands of
dollars' worth of orchard and vineyard
products. The university men investigat
ed the plague and issued a bulletin on it,
prescribing a remedy, which was a mix
ture of bran, arsenic and molasses. The
farmers have learned this treatment
through the bulletin and as a direct re
sult they have been better able to com
bat the destructive hepper this year.
The report received by Professor Wood
worth shows that Merced .County is the
only county where there arc more hop
pers this year than last. The pest has
been effectually controlled in Santa Cruz,
Frezno, Madera, Modesto, Tulare and San
Diego counties.
In some of these counties the ravages
on the vineyards was very severe. The
farmers are now becoming familiar with
scientific methods of handling these prob
lems through the publication of university
bulletins and less difficulty Is expected
from this source in coming years.

"Spinster," said the philologist, "Is the
term that the law applies to the woman
who is unmarried. The origin of the
word dates back to the days when spin
ning was not done by machinery, but by
hand. At that time every girl learned
to spin, as a matter of course, the same
as she now learns to spell. She was
obliged to spin a couple of hours every
day, and what she produced belonged to
her. Thus, every girl, by .the time she
came to get married, owned a great quan
tity of linen of her own make that she
brought, as a kind of dower, to her hus
band. Every girl's leisure, up almost to
her wedding day, was devoted to the spin
ning of linen for use in the household of
her spouse. Therefore, every unmarried
girl was called a spinster."â Philadelphia

The child, after taking the coin, parted
with it in a few minutes, giving the whole
amount to a companion. Why she stole
it is beyond her to make satisfactory ex

It," is her only statement in the matter.
Her conduct at school was. such that it
was impossible to keep her there, in spite
of her mother's many efforts.
The crowning incident was a burglary

rhyme nor reason in the offense, and Isa

a keen business instinct exists there In
both men and women, and in every class
and every set in society. Women of the

commercial enterprise, and at the present

speculations. The year 1SS7 saw the
commencement of this business era. The

of a praiseworthy pioneer. Her hat shop

as profitable an investment as did Mrs.

experiment In Dover street, Piccadilly.

a creamery near Baronscourt that sup

The Hon. Mrs. Tournourâ the name spelt
like that of Lord Winterton's family
keeps a dressmaker's shop in the same
neighborhood; and Mrs. "Bertie" Dormer,
a cousin of Lord Dormer, has recently
started as a milliner and dressmaker un
der the pseudonym of "Olivette."
Mrs. Wellesley, a relative by marriage
of the Duke of Wellington, once owned a
flower shop in lower Grosvenor place; and
now Mrs. Patrick Heron-Maxwellâan
other smart womanâ runs a florist's busi

delicate business. The Hon. Mrs. Gran
ville Knox has started as a manicurist in
a shop not farm from Piccadilly. ShÂ« is
a daughter of Harriet Lady Cllfden. a
cousin of the Marquise d'Hautepoule, and
is married to Mr. Granville Knox, a rela
tive of Lord Ranfurly. She is a pretty,
fascinating woman, and rejoices In the
pet name of "Ducky." which, by the way,
Fhe chares with the Grand Duchess of
Hesse.
Several tea shops are kept by society
women, notably one in Bond street, which
belongs to Mrs. Robertson, wife of an
army officer. The house is arranged with
great taste, has a deep Ivy-colored veian
da, and the mat-handed waitresses dress
in violet frocks, covered with white mus
lin aprons and long oversleeves. Lady
Warwick and Lady Duncannon have both
been ehopkeepers in and near Bond
street: and, although their names are
now less prominently before the public,
yet they remain equally interested in
their favorite industriesâ English-made
lingerie and Irish hand embroideries.
Some society women prefer not to co
quette with commerce, and instead they
turn their attention to Â«a serious profes
sional career. The Hon. Mrs. Scarlett-
Synge. a Bister of Lord Ablnger, has be
come a fully qualified physician and prac
tices at Bloemfontain. In South Africa,
where ehe holds the post of medical effl
cer to the Government Normal Hospital.
The South African war left us a legacy
of society nurses, but years ago Lady
Herroione Blackwood andâ before ber
marriageâ Lady Griselda Cheape, both
worked as nurses in the London hospitals.
Music claims many gifted women. The
Hon. Mrs. Julian Clifford, a sister of
Lord Henniker, is now a professional
concert singer, and Mme. Lillian Eldee. a
pretty and successful vocalist, appears in
society as Mrs. "Bill" Duncombe. whose
husband is a nephew of Lord Feversham.

After the committee of fifty has done
this it is probab'.e that a sub-committee
composed of members of the City Trus
tees and the citizen body will be named
to meet with officials of the Southern Pa
cific and ascertain what concessions the
corporation will grant in return for the
two franchises. This sub-committee will
then report back to the City Trustees, and
negotiations will be continued in this
manner un... the matter is adjusted to the
mutual rati?faction of the City Trustees
and the Southern Pacific management.
In accordance with a method suggested
by City Trustee Dr. Henry May Pond the
committeemen will be provided with bal
lots on which will appear the most Im
portant stipulations which many Alame
d^ns believe should be entered in the
terms of the franchise. The committee
men will be requc-sted to vote on these In
the order of their importance and to write
on the ballots any other stipulations which
they think should be given consideration
In settling the matter of the franchises
with the Southern Pacific Company.
To-morrow nighi is the regular meeting
time of the municipal governing body,
and it is planned to transact all of the
routine work before s o'clock and give
over the remainder of the session to ob
taining expret#ions from the committee
irjen. If any of the fifty committeemen
declines to serve the City Trustees will
be guided in their action on the franchises
by the advice of tho^e who will take part
in the deliberations of the committee. The
following named have been invited to con
fer with the Trustees:

Movements of Steamers.
Takes Steam Launch in Tow.
The b\g^ lake-built freighter Minnewaska,
twin sister tc the Mlnnetonka, arrived from
New York Saturday evening and will dock'to
day at Steuart-street wharf. She was eighty
four days from New York, twenty-eight days
from Coronel and two days from San Diego.
She encountered heavy weather coming through
the Straits of Magellan, but met with none of
the thrilling experiences which added to the
excitement of the Minnetonka's trip. The
Minnewaska han a large cargo consigned to
the American Hawaiian Steamship Company.
Her commander. Captain Laverge, is well
known here. He left this port laFt In com
mand of the whaleback Everett, when that ves
sel took from here part of America's contri
bution of grain to the starving people of
India.
Minnewaska Docks To-Day.
Three more of the big fleet of coal car
rying merchantmen bound here from
Newcastle, Australia, reached port yes
terday after fairly fast passages. Two of
them left the Australian port on the
same day, but neither sighted the other
until both veasels were within "a few miles
of the Golden Gate. They were the
British ships Chelmsford and Matterhorn,
and they made the trip in seventy-five
days, reaching port ahead of three ves
sels which started before them, but not
as soon as several that started later. The
German ship Slam, which arrived yes
terday from Newcastle, Australia, was
( seventy-nine- days coming across. She
brought 2541 tons, of coal. The Chelms
ford and Matterhorn brought, lespectlve
ly, 3750 and 2900 tons of coal. â¢
The French bark Cloch and the British
bark Inveresk, both from the Australian
coal port, were reported outside about" 5
o'clock. The Inveresk left Newcastle ten
days. after the Matterhorn and Chelms
ford and niore than two weeks after the
Cloch, whose voyage occupied ninety-two
da ye.
All the Way Across, However,
They Never Sight
Each Other.

"I'll see the Commissioners next week
to arrange for my trip . to St. Louis. J
haven't quite decided about it. You see.
It's quite a journey for an old man," and
he actually chuckled at the idea of his
being old.
Professor Dunn laughs at the thought
of old age creeping over him.
"Why, I am only 90," he says. "Nov."
you never hear of any one dying at 90!
Every day I look through those death
notices there and. my patience, there isn't
one death at 90! You see after" we get
that old we don't die, we Just go on liv
ing." Â¦
Professor Dunn has had a varied and
interesting life. Ho* has been all over
North and gouth America, making his
wonderful collection of rare bugs and
plants, and his happiest time Is when he
Is In the woods, miles from civilization.
"The best two years of my life were
those first two I spent In California," he
says. "I landed somewhere in Tuolumne
County in '49 and for two years I slept in
a blanket in the open air and lived on
what I could kill. Somstlmes I would
take a deer or a bear down into Sonora
and sell it, but what did 1 want of mon
ey when I had my trees and bugs?
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 2.â The voters of
Court House School District, which em
braces Santa Rosa and vicinity, defeated
a proposition yesterday by three votes to
bond the district for $12,000 to provide ad
ditional school facilities. It was proposed
to erect another school building with the
bonds, and it was not anticipated that
any considerable vote would be registered
against the bonds, and many refrained
from voting. There were 315 votes cast
and of these 207 were in favor of the
bonds. The law requires a two-thirda
vote to levy bonds. Another election will
probably be called in the near future, as
additional facilities are badly needed.
Bonding Proposition Defeated.

Kerbey was taken to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where his wounded foot
was attended to. Detectives Reynolds
and Armstrong were detailed on the case
and had a talk with Kerbey. Later they
arrested the boy Myles and took him to
the City Prison. Detective O'Connell,
who has known the boy for the last four
years, saw him and the boy declared
positively that he did not know the three
men. He had said "Don't shoot,. Fred,"
because he thought the man with the
shotgun was the driver of the horse em
ployed on the wharf, but he found he was
mistaken. He bad cone onto the wharf,
as it was his intention to get a police
man, and the men stopped him at the
point of a revolver. He was able to give
a good description of the man with the
shotgun.
The police are investigating a com
plaint of attempted robbery made by
Captain John R. Kerbey of the scow
schooner Mountain View, lying at the
hay wharf, foot of ThirJ street. He says
three men attacked him early yesterday
morning and one of them wounded h-.n
in the left foot by firing at him with a
shotgun.
Kerbey reported to Policeman Tobin
about R o'clock that two hours earlier
three men came on board the vessel while
he was asleep in his cabin and knocked on
the cabin door, demanding his money. He
came out of the cabin with a revolver in
his hand and fired a shot at the three
men, who had stepped back on the wharf.
A shot was fired at him, but did not take
effect.
The three men returned In half an hour
and again demanded Kerbey's money.
William Myles, a boy 18 years of age,
was on board and was to sail with the
schooner. Kerbey alleges that he heard
Myles say to one of the men "Don't shoot,
Fred," and a voice replied "I'll shoot his
head off." A shot was fired from a shot
gun at Kerbey, who was in his cabin and
some of the Dellets lodged in Kerbey's
left foot. The men then called Myles
and he Joined them on the wharf and
went away with them.

ATTEMPT TO ROB
SHIP'S CAPTAIN
The man has a graze of a bullet on the
side of the head, another had glanced
from the skull. His throat is cut from
ear to ear.
The desperate man, insane with rage
at his wife's refusal to take him back to
her, probably penned this line when he
had already shot her and the knife was
at his throat. He could not sign his
name correctly.
The woman has a shot through the
mouth, one in the eye and a third, which
crashed through the back of the skull,
carrying with it a hairpin, warped and
bent, far into the brain.
Detective Edward O'Dea and Special
Detectives McGee and Bonner found in
the room where the crime took place a
revolver with all five chambers exploded,
a keen bladed kitchen knife and the fol
lowing scrawl:
"To whom it may concern: I have com
mitted this deed. JOHN SEBINS."
"This morning I thought I heard my
mother call me at about 9 o'clock, i-Jt
I was so sleepy I didn't get up. At half
past 12 my roommate, Charlie Krlll, told
me to get up, and then I found that Sa
bins had tried to kill mother and him
self."
The boy, terror stricken, rushed to the
street and faltered in short whispers the
story of the room upstairs to two com
panions. William Dwyel and E. Gumper.
They speedily summoned the ambulance
from the Harbor Emergency Hospital and
the two unconscious forms were hurried
to the care of the physicians at the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital.
At the hospital the son and his father,
E. M. Johnson, the former husband of
the stricken woman, lingered to await
the end. Between nervous puffs of a
cigarette the boy told the story of the
swift tragedy of the morning. He said:
"My father and mother were divorced
ten years ago and then mother married
that man in there whose throat is cut.
That was nine years ago.
"Sabins was a bookbinder at H. S.
Crocker & Co.'s store. He and mother
lived happily until about nine months
ago, when his habits made her quit him.
He went to live with his mother and
brother, Frank Sabins, next door, at 1S14A
Mason street. He gave mother $20 a
month, and was always wanting her to
take him back.
When Walter Johnson, son of the wom
an who was shot, awoke at half past 12
yesterday lie heard the impatient whin
ing of a dog. He opened his door and
saw at the end of the nail a mangy white
cur, which lay with his nose to the crack
of the closed chamber door, scratching
with his front feet and emitting a
strange, clacking sound from his throat.
Young Johnson opened the door and
there beheld the scene which had been lelt
hy the swift visit of a tragedy. San
guinary stains were on the walls and the
bed covers. Sprawled across the counter
pane lay his mother, her head bullet
pierced. Sabins. her husband, stretched
across the prostrate body, with a bullet
hole in his head and his throat gaping
from a Jagged knife slash. Both still
breathed.
Murder and suicide was attempted yes
terday morning: in a squalid room at 1812
Mason street. As a result Mrs. Nellie
Sabins now lies on a cot at the Central
Emergency Hospital with three bullets In
her head, hovering in the shadow of
death, and William J. Sabins. the man
who did the deed, occupies a neighboring
couch, a bullet wound in his head and his
throat severed from ear to ear by a slash,
self-inflicted.

Affection Prompts Mur

FRANCIS FOLEY
TO BE DISMISSED
Irving Ballard Will Be
His Successor at
San Quentin.
Popular Business Man to Be
Next Commissary at
State Prison.
Irving T. Ballard will soon succeed
Francis Foley as commissary at San
Quentin prison. The appointment will be
made to-day or early in the week. Bal
lard, long identified with the oil Interests
of the State, and a man of business well
qualified for the position, will relieve an
official who distinguished himself as be
ing particularly disqualified for the re
sponsibilities placed on his shoulders and
undeserving of the confidence the people
reposed in him.
For some time the change has been un
der consideration. Foley's official career
is well known and remarkable for i s
savor of inefficiency. The selection of the
right man to fill the place ha3 been the
only matter which puzzled those who had
the power of appointment. At last Bal
lard was decided upon. The prospective
appointee is a friend of ex-Senator Felton
and enjoys the benefit of the latter's wldo
influence. It is understood that the ap
pointment will be made at Felton's re
quest. .
Ballard will be officially Informed that
he will occupy Foley's position shortly. It
is believed that he will be named to-day.
However, the time is not far off and
should one day pass the appointment will
be made before the middle of the week.
Ballard is a man of affairs. His busi
ness ability attracted attention to him
many years ago. He is versed in the sci
ence of management and great thing*" are
expected of him. His life on the coast,
has extended over a long period. Twenty
years ago he became manager of the re-
Jlneries connected with the Pacific Coast
Oil Company. He retained this position
for eighteen years and retired only wh^n
his firm merged with the Standard Oil
Company. Since then he has had no par
ticular business and has traveled consid
erably. Five days ago he returned from
Portland and will remain in this city un
til he. goes to San Quentin to assume hii
new duties.

EASTERN HEAT
REDUCES CHIEF
Head of Police Force
Home From Pleas
. ureTrip.
Chief "Wittman, who returned from his
Eastern trip on Saturday night, was busy
all day yesterday talking with his sub
ordinates and going through his corre
spondence so as to familiarize himself
with what had been going on during
his absence. The Chief, although look
ing strong and healthy, said he had lost
twelve pounds since he left the city, due
to the. excessive heat in the East.
"I can assure you," he said. "I am glad
to get back to San Francisco. People
here should be thankful that their lines
have been cast in such a pleasant place.
For climate and other conditions there is
nothing to surpass this State. The treat
in the East is so clammy and oppressive
that it takes all the energy out of you
and you have no appetite. That reminds
me that living here Is much cheaper than
In the East. I could not get a satisfactory
breakfast under $1 50, just an ordinary
meal, and other things are in proportion.
"I visited all the leading cities and was
royally treated. I found that in most of
them the police departments had better
stations than here and better electrical
appliances. We lack equipment, but as
regards the personnel of the men, San
Francisco cannot be beaten. I have no
hesitation in saying that our police force
in physique, discipline and uress cannot
be surpassed.
"The men here have shorter hours than
anywhere else and other advantages. In
Buffalo the men are eight hours on street
duty, but after reporting oft, one third
of the number is kept in reserve at each
station. In the event of a fire or a riot
these reserve men are called out and
those on patrol duty are accordingly not
taken off their beats. The municipality
provides each man with an iron bedstead
and spring mattress, but he has to pro
vide his bedding at his own expense. If
he should be changed to another station
he takes his bedding with him.
"In 'St. Louis the men are on street
duty for twelve hours at a stretch and
like the regular army they must wear
their uniform all the time. If they desire
to don civilian clothes they must ask per
mission of the chief. There are other
things that I observed and I can only say
that the men here have every reason to
be thankful for short hours, good pay
and a good climate."

Rev. William Rader, pastor of the Third
Congregational Church, delivered an ad
dress last night on "The Reign of the
Laws," in -which he made some pertinent
remarks upon modern instances of law
lessness and recommended remedies for
the evils existing. He said in part:
Lawlessness is apparently on the Increase In
the civilized world. In our own country espe
cially do we notice It. Daily, almost, we read
of negroes being burned at the stake and tor
tured by all sorts of inhumanities. Again we
Bee Justice vlotated In the ranks of the politi
cians, who fatten on their offices of patronage.
If they should ever bring Plymouth Rock to
the West it might with profit be ensconced be
neath the dome of our City Hall.
The causes for the increase of lawlessness
lfe In the Improper rearing of children where
no discipline is taught. In lax business meth
ods practiced by these same children when
they become men, in the tardiness of our Jus
tice. We cannot make men jrood by law.
For every man hanged there are a hundred
more who deserve It. We can only make them
BooJ by Instilling- Into them from their earliest
youth such a love of country that they will
be ashamed to violate her laws."

SPEAKS ON LAWLESSNESS
THE California Commissioners of
the St. Louis Exposition have
asked Professor G. W. Dunn ol
this city to take charge of the
State botanical and natural history
exhibit at St. Louis. Â«
Professor Dunn had charge of the ex
hibit at the World's Fair at Chicago, and
is still considered one of the foremost
naturalists and entomologists of the
West, although he is now 90 years of age.
He lives in a picturesque little cottage at
North Beach, a stone's throw from Fish
ermen's Wharfâ a little cottage that was
once an ark and is now set up on stilts
on the beach. What was once a resort of
the gay young bachelors who make their
summer homes on these arks has bean
converted by the old man into a cosy
home for winter, as well as summer, and
here he has brought all the rare speci
mens which he has spent the last sixty
years in collecting.
