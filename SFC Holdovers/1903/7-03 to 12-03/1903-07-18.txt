"I notice that Alphonse Hlrsch Is not

I admonished one or two gentlemen who
failed to attend meetings of the Grand

Foreman Bryan then stepped forward
and handed the court the Indictment and
the crowd waited expectantly. District
Attorney Byington was called up for con
sultation and he suggested that the bonds
be fixed at 110.000.
When this was announced. Attorney
y ACOB EPPINGER, one of tho
m members of the bankrupt firm of
M Eppinger & Co.. was Indicted
mm yesterday by the Grand Jury on
*^ the felony charge of having ob
tained money by false pretenses. The
aged grain broker appeared in court ac
companied by- his attorney, Henry Ach,
and his bondsmen, Charles S. Laumeis
ter and J. C. Franks, and obtained his
release on $10,000 bonds.
That the Eppingers knew they were to
be Indicted yesterday was evidenced by
the fact that they came prepared. While
the Grand Jury was in session Jacob Ep
pinger and his brother, Herman Eppin
ger. paced the corridors of the City Hall
and anxiously awaited the outcome of the
meeting. Their counsel, Henry Ach. was
with them, as were also their relatives
and friends. Herman Eppinger also came
prepared to secure his release if he were
indicted, but he was permitted to lea.ve
without the, formality of putting up se
curity for his appearance in court.
- The Grand Jury intended Indicting Her
man Eppinger yesterday, but was unable
to do so by reason of the fact that Dis
trict Attorney Lewis F. Bylngton could
not obtain possession of the necessary pa
pers that were to be used In the Indict
ment. These papers are in the hands of
one of the banks and owrng to the'ab

a large number of Interested spectators.

DES MOINES. Iowa, July 17.â Justice
Brewer of the United States Supreme
Court took a strong stand against the re
moval of the power of injunction in an
address before the Iowa- State Bar As
sociation, of which . he was formerly a
member, this afternoon. . He i said he
knew labor organizations were sensitive
en the question, but that this was due to
a misunderstanding, that injunctions are
merely for the purpose â¢ of preventing
bloodshed and disorder or other irrepar
able injury. He made an- eloquent plea
for the enlargement and acceptance of
the idea of universal arbitration and In
this connection lauded the work of Sec
retary Hay. Among other pStn~y sayings
by Justice Brewer were the following:
"To take ayay the^restraining power of
an injunction is a step backward toward
barbarism. The restraining power of a
court of equity is more valuable _ than
the correcting power of a criminal court.
"Laboring men at times are opposed to
injunctions, but they will come to see
that there is no thought of restraining
their rights and liberties, but only to
maintain order. We should educate by
restraint -tnore than by correction. Di
vorce suits should be conducted publicly,
although their unpleasant disclosures and
revolting facts be brought to light.
"It is not the purpose of the law to
conduct trials secretly. Better no divorce
than dl\-orce granted secretly. . Appeals
of sympathizing friends should not be In
fluential in granting a pardon."

Whistler's fame as an etcher was even
higher than his fame as a painter. His
theories on .art were eminently original
and individual, and in consequence were
made the subject of . much criticism. In
1S7S he sued. Mr. Ruskin for disparaging
his art in "Fors Cluvigera," and at the
end of a lengthy trial was awarded 1
farthing damages.
In 1S88 he -married the widow of the
late E: W. Goodwin, architect and writer,
and dauchter of J. B. Philip, the sculp
tor. In 1890 Whistler published an amus
ing book, "The Gentle Art of Making
Enemies," and it had. a large sale. He
also wrote another book, "Ten O'clock."
In 1898 he was president of the Interna

ROME. July 17, 8:25 p. m.â "I cannot
say the Pope is better, but he is no
worse-**
In these words Dr. Lapponi summed up
this evening the Pontiff's condition at the
end of the second week of his illness. In
eli the varying periods of which the Pon
tiff has scarcely bad a quieter day than
this, with the result that to-night's of
ficial bulletin declares him to be a little
Kss depressed.
la the morning, after a night during
which stimulants and nursing restored
him to a lairly good condition, tne Pope
complained of soreness due to the many
days he had passed in bed. To relieve
ihis and to humor him the patient was
allowed to sit in his armchair for a
short time, with an apparent good ef
fect. The celebration of a mass in honor
cf St. Leo and the Pope's conversation
with ilonsicnor Pifferi were the only
other incidents that relieved the tedium
of the sick chamber to-day.
From to-night's examination the liquid
in the pleura appears at about the same
level which is marked with a dermograph
ic pencil on the Pontiffs side. The phy
ticians thir.k the liquid amounts to about
1290 grams. Considering the physical con
dition of the Pope the doctors do not be
lieve it possible that his body can ab
torb it.
After the visit of the physicians the
Pope received Cardinal Rampolla, who
remained in the sickroom only a few min
utes. He again gave the Pontiff a full
report of the prayers offered in his be
half all over the world. His Holiness,
raising both har.ds, said;
"I bless all those who pray to God^for

In Vatican circles there is gossiping over
the great reception given to Monsignor
Ajute at Lisbon to celebrate his elevation
to the cardinalate and over the solemnity
with which Cardinal Agllardi to-day took
possession cf his new office of vice chan
cellor of the church. A correspondent,
however, learns that the Pope himself In
his last interview with Cardinal Agllardi
urged Ihe performance of to-day's cere
mony-.
In efaarp contrast with these ceremonies
Are the continuous preparations at the
Vatican for the death of the Pontiff. A
huge rpit twelve feet long, which has been
tjsed for roasting food for the conclaves
Eince the time of Gregory XVI, was
brought from an old storeroom to-day
and will be employed to roast quarters of
beef for the isolated Cardinals while they
are deliberating in the conclave over the
election of the successor to Leo XIII.
Drs. Lapponi and Mazzonl absolutely
deny the statement published In the Unit

It was reported to the police yesterday
that Juan Sanchez, the young Filipino
who was taken into custody several days

at the Presidio, had also stolen $300 worth
of jewelry from Mrs. S. Green of 1707

departure. Several days later an Infantry
sergeant called on Mrs. Green and re
turned all of the jewelry with the ex

He claimed acquaintance with many
prominent men of Illinois from the Gov

Chicago and Evanston last evening
brought the response that he is unknown
there and that his name is not In the.di

He went yesterday to the office of the
Transcontinental passenger bureau on
New Montgomery street, to have an over
land ticket validated. It was discovered
by the agent that his ticket was Im
properly signed and Brown was asked for
some means of identification. Apparently
laboring under the idea that he was be
ing unjustly treated he went around to
the ticket office on Market street, where
he remained for more than an hour loudly
abusing everybody and threatening to sue
the company for damages.
Th-3 actions of Brown were those* of a
man whose mind was unsettled. At
tempts to quiet him proved of no avail
and the only way. the clerks got rid of
him was when the time for closing the
office arrived. The unfortunate man
bears the appearance of one in comfort
able circumstances and he exhibited a
large roll of bills at the ticket office yes
terday. -
Brown arrived here three days ago and
stopped over night at the Palace. The
first day there he entered a complaint
against the entire methods of manage
ment of the big hostelry arid finally" 1 was
encouraged to 'move, which he did, tak

Dealing with dredging operations near
Oroville, Newton Booth Knox, in the
Mining and Scientific Press, writes:
Upon a strip of land nine miles long by two
miles in width, bordering on and adjacent to
the Feather River, twenty-one dredger* are
working. These dredgers are the property of
about twelve companies, who own dredging
land \ - arylng from 80 to SOU acres. The com
panies are all close corporations, and though
the official figures of working costs and profits
are difficult, to obtain, it is well known that
they yleia their stockholders excellent divi
dends. For instance, one company's working
expenses, including labor, repairs, power. In
terest'on capital invested, depreciation of plant,
sinking fund, etc., amounted to but 32. per cent
of the bullion output, leaving the remaining 68
per cent clear profit.. The total general aver
age of the drillings of several of the largest
companies'- holdings, covering a period of bcv
eral years, gives the value of the gravel be
tween 17 cents and ltt cents per cjibtc yard and
average depth of 11 yards. As a dredger han
dles from 1200 to 2000 cubic yards per day at a
cost of from 5 cents to 8 centsâ average ot 6
cen ts per cubic yard, it Is evident that the
returns in this work are considerable. In the
early days of California history Oroville dis
trict was extensively mined by first the white
man and later by the Chinese. It is claimed
that $82,000,000 baa been taken out within a
radius of eight miles of the town of Oroville.
The gravels were worked to .water level and
washed mostly in hand rockers. Pits and small
shafts were sunk until a rich paystreak was
encountered, which was followed,, drifted out,
hoisted to the surface and rocked. Water In
terfered greatly with this style of mining, and
only the richest streaks could be worked. The
gravels left made excellent dredging ground.
The Shenandoah mine, near Plymouth,
Amador County, is down 1000 feet In the
south shaft and more than 500 feet in the
north shaft. The two shafts arc con
nected at the 500-foot level. '
The holdings of the dredging companies who
are prospecting and dredging In the vicinity of
Folsom are very extensive and cover nearly all
the mineral lands on both sides of the Ameri
can River. Nearly, if not all of the claims
were bought outrUht. It is said, by R. G. Han
ford, who is said to be backed by the Armour*.
The dredging companies now operating or pros
pecting near Folsom are known as the Folsom
Development Company, the Syndicate Dredging
Company and the Colorado-Pacific Gold Dredg
ing Company, all of which are managed by.R.
G. Hanford. About three miles southwest of
FoUom a dreflffer Is at work, and also one. on,
the east bank of the river. In addition to this,
two new dredgers are being built at Milwau
kee that~aTe due on the dredger grounds next
October. The new dredgers will be run by
Â«lectrlc power, have five-foot buckets and will
cost $70 000 apiece. Each will handle 3000
cubic yards of gravel daily. The company is
also erecting a large machine ehop, stores,
houses and blacksmith shops.
DREDGERS AND OTHERS.
Concerning the gold dredging operations
near Folsom, the Pacific Coast â¢ Miner
says:
Shasta County has great bodies of Iron ore
on the McCloud which are now being system
atically developed. There is also an immense
body of iron ore near Bee Gum. In this county,
that is now attracting a good deal of atten
tion. It Is just over the line in Tehama Coun
ty and is owned by James Hesslewood of Red
Bluff, who has taken steps to develop It. He
has filed twenty-two mining locations and has
a ledge 400 feet across, with more than 500,(xx>
tons cf ore In sight. In fact, there is a solid
body of ore more than two miles long. It Is
about forty-seven miles southwest of Redding.

says:
OILBERT PALACHE. senior mem
ber of the firm of H. . M. Newhall
& Co., died yesterday morning at
his residence, 900 Eddy street.
Mr. Palache wag one of the best
known business men in the city, and came
to the Pacific Coast in 1S50.
Some time ago Mr. Palache met with a
severe accident. , The injury "necessitated
an operation one year ago.and since then
the patient has been In extremely poor
healtn. His age, 74 years, was against
him, and despite every medical attention
the merchant passed away*
Gilbert Palache was born at Kingston,
Jamaica, in 182S. After he came to Cali
fornia he engaged in the lumber business
and launched some ventures in the Sierra
Nevada Mountains. These were failures,
and he became employed with the Pacific
and Wells-Fargo express companies. Then
his expert business methods drew atten
tion to him, and he joined the house of
Newhall in 1S56. Soon afterward he mar
ried Miss Margery White, a sister-in-law
of the late H. M. Newhall.

The deceased was well known in politi
cal circles throughout the State. He was
elected Senator in the Twenty-fourth Sen
atorial District last November and there
fore had three more years to serve. The
Senator Williams took charge of Divi
sion No. 1 in the United States Internal
Revenue office on May 1, his district em
bracing all that portion of the city north
of Sacramento street. He attended to his
duties in the office on Thursday until near
the hour of closing," when he com
plained of what he believed to be an at
tack of indigestion,. He crossed the cor
ridor of the Appraiser's building and en
tered the office of the Marine Hospital
Service, where he asked the clerk for a
spoonful of bicarbonate of soda to relieve
what he believed to be acidity of the
stomach.
The surgeon in attendance entered the
room at this time and after examining
Senator Williams Informed him that his
affliction' was heart trouble, not indiges
tion. The' doctor advised the Senator to
go home and to bed and to send for his
family physician. Acting upon the advice
of the doctor, he went home, but did not
retire until 8:30 o'clock in the evening,
as "he- stated that he was feeling much
better. Shortly before midnight he awoke,
again suffering severe pains, and the fam
ily physician, Dr. Davis, was immediately
summoned, but all efforts to relieve the
sufferer were vain and he soon passed
away.
STATE SENATOR GEORGE H.
WILLIAMS died suddenly from an
attack of heart failure at his resi
dence. 101JH* Clay street, shortly
after 2 o'clock yesterday morning.
The death of Senator Williams was most
unexpected and was a great shock to his
relatives and friends.
Miss Green gained her first fame in this
city by entering Into an engagement con
tract with a prominent street car official
three years ago. At that time his wife
was stilL living, but she. died soon after
and the young woman endeavored to en
force the contract. She finally instituted
suit for $3O,0CKT, which never came to trial.
The Doolan note is said to be in the
possession of a bank, which has demand
ed payment and threatened suit If it is
not settled.
Inspirited by Doolan's example. Dr.
Hicks concluded that he. too. must taste
of Miss Green's lips, but she had raised
the ante for him. It iost him $125. which
amount was likewise paid over in the
form of a promissory note. According to
the testimony the doctor had been paying
such assiduous attention to the liquid re
freshments that at the first attempt to
sign the note his signature was so illegi
ble that no one could read it. and the
fair \ payee Insisted on him signing It a
second time in such a manner that the
name could be made out.
In the course of time the Hicks note
found Its way into the hands of D. A.
Curtin, who sued on It, and the case camu
up before Judge Lawson for hearing.
After eliciting the above statements ot
fact the court ordered the case thrown
out of court. So Insistent, however, was
the counsel for the plaintiff In continuing
the hearing that Jt became necessary to
have the courtroom cleared by two stal
wart bailiffs.
Kisses from the red lips of Ml3s Marian
Green come high, if the testimony of wit
nesses in Justice of the Peace Lawaon's
court yesterday are to be believed. It is
of record there, as sworn to. by several
men. that she placed a value of 5100 on an
osculatory salutation delivered to one M.
Doolan of Oakland, and for a similar ser
vice performed to Dr. William P. Hicka
of this city she demanded $125.
-Miss Green is a tall, blonde beauty, and
she looks as though her kisses might bo
worth considerable as such thlnga go. but
the above amounts are away above the
prices since the days when Antony madly
threw away a world for Cleopatra's kiss.
Since then the market has been bearish.
The scene where these costly embraces
were bestowed was in the rear room of a
drugstore at Polk and McAllister streets.
There during a night In the damp month
of last January a merry party gathered.
There were half a dozen men and Miss
Green was the only one of her sex pres
ent, but she made up in vivacity what she
lacked In numerosity. The flowing bowl,
filled with that fierce brand of booze that
is obtainable only in Kansas or a drug
store, passed rapidly around, and under
Its inspiriting Influence the one Doolan of
Oakland aforesaid concluded that life was
not worth living unless he could kiss tho
fair Marian. She was coy. but finally
agreed to permit his caress on the pay
ment of S10G\ Doolan didn't care about
the price, but he lacked 15 cents of having
any money at all with him. so he gave
Miss Green a promissory note for $100 and
took the kiss.

have th* collection returned to California Â«t

Ftate will he in Â« position to make a mineral
exhibit.' whereas in the pan collections have
bwn given away without resultant benefits.
With a ;wrmanent exposition collection mine
owners will not be calk-d upon frequently, as
they have befn at other times, for donations.
It ii inadvisable to make up collections from
the Minlr.iT Bureau exhibit, for many reasons.
Principal amonK ihfrn is the fact that "yearly
thf bureau ts visited by not less than 100,000
visitors, and many investors, before making
an investigation of a property, rail at the bu
reau to obtain information and inspect samples
of the minerals In the museum. Should these
specimens be pert to an exposition, in most
Â¦ .Iâ > they would be retained for at lcaet one
year, thus preventing: those who might derive
*cme benefit from the minerals were they on
exhibition at the bureau, from having an op
portunity to inspect the Fame. In such cases
the benefits accruing from a mineral collec
tion m-ould be greater at the bureau than at
en exposition. Therefore the State should
own a duplicate mineral exhibit for exposition
purpoEes. and the present is a Rood time to
beRin its collection.
Manufacturers cf mining machinery will
probably aid to have a large meehanlf.il
exhibit. In the letter that has been pre
pared the State Mineralogist says:

To secure an adequate collection of the
minerals of California for the St. Louis
show Mineralogist Aubury tias appointed
two agents, one for Northern and one for
Fouthrrn California. The work in the
north will begin in S!fkiyou County. In
the south the acent will begin at San
Dlepo County, moving northward. Col
lectors of minerals will also be appointed
to travel through the central counties and
the interior generally. Owing to the small
amount <>f the appropriation that the St.
Louis Exposition Commissioners have
avails hie for all purposes an appeal has
been made 1 to the enmities by the Com
missioners, in conjunction with the State
Mineralogist, to assist in the work of
gathering mineral specimens. Pome coun
ties have signified intention to lend aid
and will appoint local collectors through
their Suoervisors.
AGENTS AHE APPOINTED.
A circular Irtter has been Issued by
Etate Mineralogist Lewis E. Aubury giv

ing the mectns adopted to secure a large

tninrrals to be shown in the m!nes and

Judge Church at the close of the testi
mony stated that while tHe father was
the natural guardian of the son. the In

and he believed from the testimony that
Henry Seller was totally unfit to be the
boy's guardian. He therefore freed the
boy from his father and appointed J. E.
Plle'gard his guardian.
FRESNO, July 17^-Peter Seller.' aged
18 years, young, ambitious, but unable
even to read or write anything save his
own name, wan to-day by his own ap
plication released in the Superior Court
from the guardianship of an idle father
who for vears has made the boy his ab
ject slave." Henry Seller, the father, is
a man in the prime of life, strong and
healthy, but for yeats he has not worked,
living entirely off the earnings of his
children and spending most of his time
idling about the saloons In the city.
Young Peter has had profitable employ
ment in a bottling works, drawing a sal
ary of $75 a month. But not a cent of
it has he seen, his father collecting the
money every payday and responding to
his requests for part of It with blows and
curses. Peter, too, has been ambitious
to learn to read and write, other boys
often ridiculing him for his ignorance.
But his father has refused to let him
go to school, or even -to let him study
for himself. Recently the boy was turned
out of doors by his father and went to
a boarding-house, but when payday camÂ«
the father 'appeared as usual and took
*the money and refused to give the son
even enough to pay his board bill.
A sister of young Peter testified to-day
in his behalf. She told her own story,
worse- even than' Peter's, stating that
on account of her father's drunkenness
and brutality: she had left home, taking
with her her little baby brother, an in
valid, who was, dying at home because of

Melrose was to-night acquitted of the
charge of murdering W. H. Broome at
Acton. Los Angeles County. last Septem
ber. This was the second trial, the jury
in the first trial failing to agree. The
case was given into the hands of the
jury late this evening and after thirty
minutes' deliberation a verdict of "not
guilty" was returned. Two jurors voted
for conviction on the first two ballots,
but on the third ballot' the verdict was
found.
The case has aroused a great deal of
local Interest owing to the political prom
inence of Melrose and the usual and bit
ter feud that had existed between Broome
and Melrose. Broome came upon Melrose
in the streets of Acton one day last fall
and renewed the fight that had been on
between them for a long time. Broqme
had a shotgun. Melrose shot Broome sev

PHOENIX, Ariz.. July 17.â The first im
portant step in the movement to secure
the building- of the Tonto storage reser
voir, under the provisions of the Hans
brough-Newlands Irrigation act, was
completed to-day. This step, which is
jircbably the most difficult that will be
met with in the project, consisted in exe
cuting liens to the Salt River Valley Wa
ter Users' Association on every "acre of
land to be irrigated. Each acre, up to the
limit of 169, will represent one share of
Ftock in the association, which, in turn,
will contract to pay back to the Govern
ment within ton years the construction
cost of the reservoir. The subscription
books closed to-night. The total acreage
tinned is 195,<Â»;i. with some contracts yet
to be received by mail.
The Secretary of the Interior will decide
upon the area to be irrigated, as his rep
resentatives have announced that the
stored water supply will be sufficient to
water not to exceed 1SO.OO0 acres. From
th*> area subscribed the Secretary will se
tect the most desirable tracts within the
Jiir.it of supply. It Is purposed to develop
electric power at the dam. thus furnish
ing means for pumping water to lands not
irrigated by the Tonto reservoir.
The next step will be the drawing up of
a contract between the Federal Govern
ment and the Water Users' Association
and its adoption by the corporation. This
will provide for a governing board and
executive officers, chosen by ballot of the
stockholders. The Secretary of the In
terior will pass upon all matters of policy,
thus protecting the rights of Individual
water users.

Lopez Is accused of assault with a

Upon further interrogation Perry admit
ted that the paper was destroyed in his
presence after. the signing of the deeds
of gift.
"Did you ever see a will?" . ;
"No. I cannot say I saw* a will. Mrs.
Ross showed me a package, done up in
brown paper, which she said was a will.
I went with her when she put the pack
age in the San Francisco Savings Union."
"When did you see it again?"
"I saw it, I think, about two weeks
later while at Mrs. Ross' house."
"Did you ever hear the contents of that
documenj?"
"No, I did not."
Witness Perry was then recalled and
testified that he saw the deeds of gift
signed.
"When were they signed?" was asked.
"April 24. 1901." replied the witness. .
At this juncture Attorney Newb'.irg
stated to the court that in every instance
where Mrs. Ross signed her name before
February 15, a scroll or rublco appeared,
but subsequent to that date there were
no papers bearing this identifying, mark.
The deeds of gift were not sighed in her
customary way.
Young Makin was then shown the deeds
of gift and y&nsfer deed, bearing Mrs.
Ross' signature, and asked if the writing
resembled that of his grandparent.
"Yes, it looks Hke her handwriting," re
plied Makin, "but it Is not like her sig
nature."'

The auestion of the right of the Har
ders-Berger faction of the Union Labor
party to a place on the ticket at the
coming primary was the subject of a live
ly discussion in Judse Murasky's court
yesterday. It came up on a petition for
a writ of mandate compelling the Board
of Election Commissioners to grant their
petition for a place on the ticket, the
petitioners claiming that theirs is the
bona fide Union Labor party, and that
the Ewell-Aubertlne faction, whose peti
tion had been recognized by the board,
was not the choice of the Labor party.
A partial hearing was had and it was
then continued until this morning.
H. C. McPIke appeared on behalf of
the coterie of politicians headed by Ewell
and Aubertine. He contended that the
court had no Jurisdiction over the Com
missioners, and that therefore the court
could not review their action. He de
murred to the petition on that ground. *
He was answered by Hiram Johnson,
the lecal representative of Harders and
Berger, who were turned down by the
board. Johnson he!d that the board's
powers were ministerial and not judicial
and therefore subject to review by the
court. At this morning's session he will
offer authorities in support of his conten
tion.
There were but two witnesses exam
ined. They were Samuel Berger, secre
tary of the governing committee of the
Union Labor party, which has failed to
secure recognition through the action of
the Commissioners, and Harry. Zemansky.
Chief Deputy Registrar. Berger testified
that the committee he represented was
selected at last year's convention: that
it conducted the campaign for the Union
I^abor party, and was therefore the only
committee empowered to petition for rep
resentation at the coming primary. Ze
mansky's testimony was simply an identi
fication of the petitions filed with Regis
trar Walsh.
The Judge said that he had no authority
to send the defendant for examination as
to his sanity as that was a matter for the
Superior Court. If the defendant was in
sane he should be *in a lunatic asylum
and if he were sane the proper place for
him was in jail. Any man who would
wantonly attack Sisters on the public
streets must either be a lunatic or unfit to
be at large in a respectable community.
After sentence had been passed Attor
ney Low said he would take steps to bring
Selbach before the Insanity Commission
ers for examination.
W r . H. Selbach, the dentist from Co T
lumbus, Ohio, who attacked Sisters Mar
guerite and Lorenzo of the German Do
minican Convent last Tuesday afternoon*
at Market and Third streets, was con
victed by Police Judge Conlan yesterday
on two charges of battery. He was sen
tenced to serve six months in the County
Jail on each charge.
The Sisters have not yet returned to the
city, and Policeman P. X. Herlihy, who
r;as a witness to the attacks and ar
rested the defendant, swore to the com
plaints. Herlihy testified' that he saw
the defendant shove Sister Marguerite,
who fell to the sidewalk, and also tear
the veil from Sister Lorenzo's head.
' Former Judge Low, who represented the
defendant, asked him to take the stand.
Selbach repeated the story he told at the
time of his arrest. He said he got be
tween the Sisters and one of them stepped
on his foot, hurting his corns. He shoved
her aelde and she slipped and fell. At
the same time he put out his other. hand
and accidentally tore off the veil from
the other Sister's head. He denied any in
tention of assaulting them.
Attorney Low made the plea that the
defendant was not in his > right mind and
was therefore not in a condition to be
sentenced. He suggested that the de
fendant be sent before the Insanity Com
missioners.

The injunction was withdrawn on March
21.
The. commission again announced an ex
amination, this time for March 21. Im
mediately a second injunction was filed
in Judge Sloss' court, with the name of
C. A. Macomber, a mining promoter, as
complainant. It is upon the decision of
this case that Parry hangs his hopes,
for It will come up in the fall calendar
of the Superior Court.
Immediately . upon the Introduction of
this 6uit Parry set the wheels into mo
tion. For many months the question of
charging m. rate for the private alarms
had been his pet hobby in the meetings
of the Department of Electricity. He
again advocated that a recommendation
favoring. the measure be sent to the Su
pervisors.
HECHT CONFIBMS FACTS.
Such was done, and the Supervisors re
ferred it to the Fire Committee, com
posed of R. J. Loughery. Horace Wilson
and John A. Lynch. Parry saw to it
that a favorable report was made and
the ge-ntle offspring of Parry's fertile
brain became a law on April 15.
Marcus Hecht. whose resignation from
the presidency of the Board of Fire Com
missioners on 'June 6 was forced by the
rank rascalities of Parry, confirmed the
story of his former associate's latest graft
when seen at his home last nieht. He
said:
"It Is a significant fact that the sec
ond Injunction was brought against the
Civil Service Commission three weeks be
fore the passage of ordinance No. 638 by
the Supervisors. As a member- of the
Department of Electricity, Parry was in
cessantly advocating this measure until
we passed it in the form of a recommen
dation. He was loud in his protestations
that the Department of Electricity em
ployes were not subject to civil service.
I was expecting just such a move on
his part as that manifested through the
act of the Board of Supervisors In pass
ing this ordinance."
State Prison Director Charles N. Felton
went to Sacramento yesterday forenoon,
had a two hours' consultation with Gov
ernor Pardee during the afternoon and
came back to San Francisco on the even
ing train.* He was asked last night if the
question of electing a Warden for San
Quentln prison to succeed Martin Aguirre
was discussed, and he replied that it was
only incidentally touched upon. He said
the main business discussed related to
two other subjects, but declined to state
what the other subjects were.
He was asked if a selection of a War
den would be made at the meeting of the
board to-day, and he replied that it un
doubtedly would. When asked if he could
name the candidate who would succeed
Aguirre he said, "I cannot, as I do not
know how other Directors feel."'
Replying to the question, "How do you
feel yourself, Senator?" he si.:J:
"Without apy disparagement to the
ability and high character of :he several
aspirants, I feel that by re.vson of his
long experience the appointment of Cap
tain Edgar would be the safest solution
for the present."
The Directors will meet at Mr. Fitzger

"The first person to advise that we ap
peal to the courts was Richard P. Luce.
He was a wireman's helper employed in
the department at the- salary of $90 a
month, although he had not reached his
majority by several years. He is Parry's
nephew and lives with Parry's family.
Upon his instigation we clubbed together
and raised enough money to hire Stephen
V. Costello as our attorney. We then
instituted the injunction .proceedings, with
Mike Barry as complainant.
"All this time Parry was assuring the
Civil Service Commission' that, as a mem
ber of the Department of Electricity, he
would use every endeavor to have us
withdraw our Injunction suit. But
through his mouthpiece. Luce, he was
urging us to stay with it.
"But on February 24 we were summoned
before the Civil Service Commissioners
and put upon our oaths to disclose the
work we had been doing. Parry voted
against us and we were all dropped by
a- unanimous vote."
The minutes of the Civil Service Com
mission bear out Ahern's story of Parry's
double dealing. On February 24 the com
mission, at a secret session, examined the
following employes of the Department of
To gain his ends Parry stopped at noth
ing. His operations cover a. period' of
over nix months. As early as February
H Parry saw an opportunity to lay the
cornerstone of his castle of ambition.
The Civil Service Commission had an
nounced early in the year that a com
petitive" examination would be given to
linemen in the Department of Electricity
on February 14. Of the employes in the
department there were, six malcontents,
who, through an injunction brought into
Judge Hebbard's court under the name
of an ex-saloon-keeper. Michael J. Barry,
contested the right of the Civil Service
Commission to give an examination in
that department.
According to the statement to a Call rep
resentative yesterday by David Ahem of
20 Alvarado street this move was made
at the instigation of Fire Commissioner
Parry. He said:

DEMAND PLAGE
ON THE TICKET
There is at present pending in the Su
perior Court an injunction suit, the ad
judication of which will determine wheth
er or not the Department of Electricity
shall be governed by civil service or open
to the Fpoils system of municipal poli
tics. This suit hinges on the question of
whether or not the Department of Elec
tricity can be construed to be other than
a public servant. If the advantages of
fered by the department have to be paid
for directly bj- citizens enjoying them the
ptatus of the department as a public com
modity is thereby shaken.
Trusting to establish this precedent by
the force of his own strategy, facts prove
that Parry hoodwinked a majority of
the Board cf Supervisors into passing or
dinance No. â¬5* on April 15. thereby mak
ing the owners of private fire alarm sys
tems â by far the largest number of whom
are. firemenâ pay a nominal rental for the j
e&m*. in this way he sought to demon
strate that the Department of Electricity I
deals in a public commodity, and hence i
Parry's scheme was a deep laid one.
The betrayal of the Interests of the Fire
Department was only one step toward
the final consummation of the political
coup which Parry relied upon as the key
which should open to his rapacious grasp
the rich field of patronajce in the De
partment of Electricity, now securely
locked under the protecting barriers of
the Civil Service Commission.

FACTS have developed which show conclusively that Fire

plot to take the offices of the Department of Electricity out
of the hands of the Civil Service Commission and turn them to
his own private purposes of graft. To accomplish* his ends he
fostered tlie injunctions brought against the commission by em
ployes of the department to prevent the giving of examina
tions. He then endeavored to influence justice by seeking to
have the Supervisors create conditions which would serve as a
guide for Judge Sloss in the second injunction suit.
FIRE COMMISSIONER PARRY PLOTS TO GATHER LUCRATIVE
OFFICES OF DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICITY INTO HIS HANDS
Fire Commissioners
Hold a Lively
Session.
Parry Waxes Wroth
When Refused
Support.
THE regular weekly meeting of the
Fire Commissioners yesterday aft
ernoon was a lively one. Commis-
sioner Parry had his knife out
from the start, and while he managed to
get in a swipe or two, he wound up with
a round halt when he tried to foist one
of hi3 henchmen, Elmer Hoyt, into' the
position just made vacant by the resigna
tion of Hostler Kendall. Then he waxed
wroth and addressing himself, to Rolla V.
Watt he shouted:
I want you to understand this, and you may
as well understand it now, that what I say
goes ! In my department as committee on
stables, and it will go so long as I am on this
board or until I rot.
But notwithstanding this assertion his
friend Hoyt was not elected, and the
board even refused to allow Hoyt remu
neration for his services (or the short
time that Parry had engaged him on his
own responsibility to do hostler work In
the stables.
From the opening of the session there
was a lack of harmony attending all the
proceedings, each member having appar
ently come prepared with his razor to do
a certain amount of slashing.
The question of letting the contract for
hay for the coming year was held over
for further discussion until next meeting.
T'he horse question was next discussed.
The eight horses that had been sent in for
trial by the Howard estate proved to
meet requirements. They were ordered
purchased at J1SJ a head.
WILL RIDE IN AUTOMOBILE.
The snbject of the automobile brought
out quite a controversy. The Board of
Supervisors had granted $3000 for a ma
chine for the use of the Chief of the Fire
Department. Parry was dead set against
Its purchase, and Chief Sullivan said that
the money could be applied to better ad
vantage in buying new fire apparatus.
W T att replied that so long as the Super
visors had made this specific appropria
tion for the machine there wa* no reason
to revert the money to other channels.
The machine was accordingly ordered
purchased from the ' only bidder, A.
Brooke Ridley, representing the Electric
Vehicle Company, Parry voting against
the purchase.
At this period of the meeting matters
commenced to get breezy.
Â¦ Parry moved that Frank Brown, one
of the draymen, be dismissed. Watt asked
"For what reason?" Parry said it -was
not necessary to give any reasons, it was
sufficient for the board to know that he
(Parry) wanted him discharged. Watt
insisted and asked Patrick O'Connell, the
superintendent of horses, if there was
anything wrong with Brownâ receiving a
reply in the negative â Watt said emphat
ically, "I don't believe in tiring men with
out a good and sufficient cause and I be
lieve that every man should have the
chance of an American citizen and be al
lowed to be heard in his own behalf."
Parry then chipped -in and said: "Well," I
don't like him. He' is an idler and spends
his time, talking too much -and carrying
news, and I want him dismissed."
Vote was then taken 'and Brown's head
fell into the basket, with a dissenting vote
from Watt. A. Steffens of 2711 Sutter
elreet was elected to fill his place, with
Watt again casting a dissenting vote.
REFUSE TO SUSTAIN PARBY.
Hostler Kendall's place was not filled.
It was temporarily occupied by Elmer
Hoyt, appointed by Parry without author
ity and Parry and Maestrettl fought for
all they knew how to have the tempo
rary appointment made permanent, but
Watt and Barrett wanted John O'Bryan
appointed, so matters came to . a stand
still.
Then. "Parry raised the question of the
pay due Hoyt for the time' he had been
in service. Watt said he did not want to
see any man work for nothing, but want
ed to know if he was paid up to the pres
ent time would Parry guarantee that the
board would not be compelled to do a
similar office- for Hoyt at the next meet
ing. Parry refused to give any such as
surance and intimated that he would take
matters into his own hands. He was
brought to his senses by Watt, who stated
that it was his impression that the vote
of the majority of the board would rule
in the future, as it had in the past.
The question of the transfer of Patrick
O'Connell, superintendent of horses, from
that position to driver of one of the en
gines was not allowed to come up for the
board's consideration for the reason that
Attorney D. C. Murphy put in an appear
ance and, on behalf of his client, O'Con
nell, served a writ addressed to the board
collectively and individually, citing; them
to appear in Superior Court, Department
No. 2, on Friday morning, July 24, at 10
o'clock to show cause for the intended
transfer. Attorney Murphy said that the
citation sent to his 'client was not in due
and correct form. Parry said the trans
fer of O'Connell was necessary for the
betterment of the department. Finally
it was decided to lay the matter before
the City and County Attorney and get
his advice in the premises, and so the
matter of O'Connell's fate is still hanging
in the balance.

Inspector Walter S. Mayer of Chicago,
who worked up the case against August
W. Machen, the former head of the free
delivery service, has figured conspicuous
ly In obtaining the evidence placed In
possession of the District Attorney at
Brooklyn.
The authorities are now searching for
Beavers to place him under arrest. His
present whereabouts is . unknown. The
postal officials were chagrined to learn of
the publicity of the action of the Grand
Jury in advance of the serving of the
warrant. They regarded' the news as
premature and declined to discuss the
matter on the ground that the time was
not yet ripe to make a statement. Fourth
Assistant Postmaster General Brlstow
conferred with several of his assistants
immediately after he learned that the ac
tion of the Grand Jury had become
known. Subsequently he refused to an
swer all questions on the subject.
The case on which the present action
of the Grand Jury Is based. It Is said,

rnfnaticn of an Investigation that has
been In progress at intervals since his
sudden resignation from office last spring.
A number of matters affecting his ad

FORMER POSTOFFI^E OFFICIAL.
WHO IS ACCUSED OF HAVING
ACCEPTED A BRIBE.
General Passenger Agent Goodman, dis
cussing the appointment, said that Iso
moto recently came here from Japan and
called upon him regarding a proposition
to bring Japanese rice farmers to this
country with a view of developing the
lands owned by the company in the States
of Louisiana and Texas. Continuing Mr.
Goodman said:
Ills plan looked like a good one. so I referred
him to General Passenger Agent Anderson of
the Atlantic system, who. It seems, lmmedl-
The appointments came as a joyous bit
of news to the former employes of the
Missouri Pacific offices In tills city, who
lost their positions vrtien the agency was
recently abolished here. Waugh, Webster,
Townsend and Berry arc all cared for un
der Shotwell's plan of rearrangement. The
two clerks who were attached to the
Texas Pacific office have gone to Los
Angeles, there to secure employment In
the Texas and Pacific office, and conse
quently everybody formerly connected
with the different offices of the Gould
lines In this, city went home happy last
evening.
General Agent Shotwell said yesterday
that while there appeared to have been a
consolidation of the different offices the
move made by Traffic Manager Bird was
In reality an abolishment of the Missouri
Pacific and the Texas Pacific offices
In this city. ' Hereafter the interests of
the two roads mentioned and those of the
Iron Mountain and the International and
Great Northern would-be represented here
by the Denver and Rio Grande agency,
over which he will preside with the official
title of general agent.
Further evidence of the Southern Pacific
traffic department's often manifested en
terprise was furnished yesterday, when
the following circular notice was Issued
by the passenger officials:
K. Isomoto of Kobe, Japan, 'has this day
been appointed Japanese land and immigration
apent for the Southern Pacific Sunset route.
Mr. Isomcto's duties will be to encourage Jap
anese Investors and rice farmers to purchase
lands and settle in the eulf coast country of
Louisiana and Texas. Mr. Isomoto will work
directly In connection with the general offices
of the system In Fan Francisco and In Hous
ton. Tex., and In the conduct of his people he
will be accorded every assistance and attention.
General Agent Shotwell of the Denver
and Rio Grande road, who returned
Thursday night from Denver, whither he
went a week ago to confer with the of
ficials of the Gould lines restive to the
reorganization of the offices of that great
system in this city, yesterday officially
announced the changes he had planned In
local departments which have been placed
under 'his supervision. Besides the pro
motion of Buck and Mansfield to the posi
tions of district passenger agent and com
mercial agent, the following appointments
were given out during the day: Walter
Townsend and Fred Berry, to be travel
ing passenger and freight agents; Bode
K. Smith and W. W. Webster, city pas
senger agents: E. Sllverstone, contracting
agent; John T. Skelton, freight and pas
senger agent at Sacramento; Leroy B.
John3on, freight and passenger agent at
San Jo3e; . Edward Waugh, assistant
freight and passenger agent at San Jose;
John H. Beckwith, city passenger agent
in Oakland.
The application of Wells, Fargo & Co. !
that Us assessment on franchise for i
1450.000 was illegal and that it be can- j
celed, was also denied. The contention ;
of the express company Is that It Is In- i
corporate-d under the laws of Colorado !
end that Its franchise Is not taxable in '
California. â¢
ALL MORTGAGES ABE TAXABLE. \
The Supreme Court of California has Â¦
ruled that a foreign corporation shall not !
operate in this State under more favor
able conditions than a local corporation
end the express company has carried the
case to the Supreme Court of the United i
States. Its application for a reduction at '
th* present time was made to protect Its
legal rights.
The Hibemia Savings and Loan Society
also applied for a reduction of its assess
ment on fl.000,000. The claim dt the society
was that the city could not tax mortgages
tn land situated outside the State. The
"There Is not a fiair in the indictment
of thÂ«? Assessor and it is bad enough, but
I must submit," was the reply of Daniel
Meyer, raillicnaire banker, when called
upen yesterday to show cause before the
Board of Supervisors why his arbitrary
assesnnert of a million dollars on his
pcrscnr.I property should not stand.
The Supervisors sat as a board of equal
ization and passed upon the applications
for reduction of assessments, also upon
all arbitrary assessments.
Last year Assessor Washington Dodge
assessed Daniel Meyer for half a million
dollars on personal property. This year
also Meyer refused to make a sworn re
turn of his property and his assessment
was raised to the million figure.
Assessor Dodge' told the Supervisors
that Canker Meyer has always refused to
furnish a sworn statement, and that he
was in contempt.
When Daniel Meyer admitted the im
peachment of the Assessor there was con
siderable laughter in the room, in which
the votcran financier joined.
DENIES HE IS A BANKER.
Meyer denied that he was a banker,
and when Assessor Dodge informed him
that he was so designated In the city di
rectory the financier smilingly answered: I
"That is my misfortune. I am only a !
business man. I have nothlne to say
against the argument of the Assessor,
but it costs me a good deal of money."
The Supervisors scugnt to gain some
information from Meyer as to how much
money he had in bank and how much
he had loaned out. but he pleaded igno
nance. and said â¢ - the young people at
tend to that for me."
When the Supervisors voted that the
arbitrary assessment of a million dollars
remain Meyer said. "Thank you, gentle
men." and with a Emile he bowed himself
out of the room.
Considerable time was taken up in con
sidering the application of the Southern
Pacific Company that the assessments on j
its ferry cyftem franchises be reduced j
f!y>m EL25O.0M to $15.
Attorney Foulds appeared for the com
pany ar.fi made an elaborate argument
that the ferry-boats were part of the en
tiro railroad fvstem and could be as
sessed as rart of that system by the
State Board of Equalization only. He
arpued that no such thing as a ferry
franchise existed, and that it was a crea
tion of the Assessor's brain.
BAILEOAD'S CLAIM EEJECTED.
Foulds cited many decisions of the Su
preme Court and admitted that, while the
law provided for the assessment of the
ft rry-boatfi by local Assessors, that any
franchise, if Fuch existed, was included i
in the broad franchise under which the i
railroad was operated.
Assessor Dodge made a skillful argu- \
mer.t to the effect that the State Board of j
Equalization had last year only dealt
with the railroad company's property,
commencing at the Oakland mole.
He claimed that If a local Assessor had I
the right to tax tangible property. In the
thapt' of ferry-boats, he also had the j
right to assess the Intangible property, |
the franchise, under which the boats were '
operated.
Supervisor Braunhart was of the opin
ion that the railroad company had no
right to appear before the board and ask
for a practical cancellation of the assess- !
mer.t of the ferry franchise. He declared f
that the Supervisors merely had power to j
raise or lower assessments and not to de- i
cide the legality of any assessment. That '
was a matter for the courts.
The Supervisors, by unanimous vote, re
jected the application of the railroad cor
poration.
Rlnck-Wagner added that there is no
foundation in the statements that reli
gious prejudice Is at the bottom of the
murders in Russia. The Jews, he said,
enjoy a full exercise of their religious
customs and' go about undisturbed j until
the peasantry Is called upon to make set
tlements for money loaned and for bills
contracted and then the trouble begins.
In Odeasa there are frequent demonstrations
Against the Jews, and there was one at the
time that the murders wero being committed
In the other section of the provinces, but the
police, who were anticipating an outbreak,
promptly quelled it in Its Infancy. We have a
large number of Jews in Odessa. In fact the
population of the city is one-third Jews, and
they practically control all lines of business
there. Their Influence In a commercial way Is
suggested during the Jewish holiday weeks,
when the entire town seems to be closed up. I
dcubt If there will ever be a solution found for
stemming the tide of piejudlce against the Jews
in Russia. In Odessa they are treated with
more consideration than most anywhere else In
the empire. Although not permitted to own
lend, they are allowed to leaso it and build
houses, and they enjoy this privilege to its
fullest extent.
E. Rinck-Wagner, a wealthy German
resident of Odessa, arrived from the East
last evening and Is stopping at the Pal
ace. He is making a tour of the world
and left his home about the end of the
recent terrible massacres of Jews in Rus
sia. In speaking of the affair which has
aroused the sympathy of almost the en
tire civilized world, the traveler said that
massacres had become common events in
that section of Russia, where the preju
dice against the Jews is increasing every
year. As to the causes of the attacks on
the Jews he said:
They are due to the feelings of the peas
antry, as the Kusnlan Kmbassador to the
United- States recently explained In an Interview
to the representatives of your newspapers.
The Jew Is the medium through which all
business is transacted In Russia. lie Is keener
In business matters than the peasant class of
Russians and Is quick to perceive an opportu
nity to increase his wealth. The peasant bor
rows from htm often, and too frequently more
than he should. When the day of settlement
comes and the Jew demands what Is due him
his debtor suddenly realizes that he has noth
ing left and begins to grumble. His ill feeling
Is aroused and It Increases as he contemplates
his financial predicament.
Eventually the dissatisfaction spreads like
an epidemic and then the peasantry seeks re
venge for imaginary wrongs by assailing th?
Jews. When I refer to these affairs as common
events L mean that these massacres are occur
ring e<ery year. I was In Odessa when tha
refugees began coming In from the scene of the
recent slaughter, but I am unable to give you
any further details than you have already
haO, for. although Odessa Is only eight hours'
ride from where the more horrible scenes were
enacted, we were unable to obtain much In
formation, owing to the fact that the press of
that country, as you no doubt know, is greatly
restricted in the publication of news, especially
of that character.
Traveler From Odessa Looks for Re
currence of Massacres.
FEARS FOR SAFETY OF JEWS.
It is believed that this petition was al
most unexampled in the height and dig
nity of the signatures attached to it.
Among them are: Andrew D. White and
Clifton L. Brecklnrldge, former Minister
to Russia: Rufus W. Peckham, United
States Supreme Court; Senator Thomas
C. Platt, the Governors of Virginia, Geor
gia, Mississippi. North Carolina, Louis
iana and Nebraska: the Chief Justices
of all the States from which returns are
In. a great number of Congressmen, pub
licists, banker?, Prote3tanl and Catholic
ministers. Mayors of leading cities, prom
inent educators, leaders of the bar, phy
sicians, scholars, manufacturers, etc."
When the petition reaches Washington
the various oages will be bound together
In magnificent style in one volume and
delivered to Andrew Allen, chief of the
bureau of the rolls of the State Depart
ment, for safe keeping.
"Sirs: I am directed by the President
to acquaint you that this department Is
Informed by the American embassy In St.
Petersburg that the Imperial Government
of Russia has declined to receive or con
sider the petition In relation to the condi
tion of the Jews in Russia which was ad
dressed to his Majesty the Emperor by a
large number of citizens of the United
States and which this department, by di
rection of the President and at your re
quest, undertook to transmit to Its high
destination. I am, sirs, very respectfully
yours, JOHN HAY."
The instruction was* sent on the 13th of
July, and the same day Mr. Riddle was
Informed by the Russian Minister for
Foreign Affairs that in view of the pub
lications which had appeared in the news
papers the Russian Government wished to
notify him that the proposed petition
would not be received under any circum
stances, and that this resolution of the
Russian Government was taken independ
ently of any consideration of the sub
stance or the terms of the petition. On
the receipt of this Information the Secre
tary of State addressed the following let
ter to Messrs. Strauss, Wolf and Levy of
the Jewish committee that prepared the
petition:
WASHINGTON. July 17.â It is stated by
thÂ© Secretary of State that the Incident
created by the question of the presenta
tion of the Jewish petition to Russia Is
closed. The State Department to-day
made public the correspondence that has
taken place respecting the petition. Its
substance has already been forecasted in
the pre/s dispatches.
The Correspondence consists of an in
struction to Mr. Riddle, United States
Charge at St. Petersburg, reciting in de
tail the petition and directing him to pre
sent the same to the Foreign Office If it
were willing to receive it. It Is stated by
Mr. Riddle that the Foreign Office would
not receive It under any circumstances,
and Secretary Hay so informed the Jew
ish committee in a brief telegram.

The Totrcr these symptoms Â«xist the more

commercial instinct or experience which will enable
him to get his fruit in market and get the market
price in cash. This experience is becoming more
extended every year and covers more of the fruit
product. By and by every pound of it will be han
dled wisely and profitably.
To show what may be done in seeking far abroad
for a market, one of our most enterprising fruit
growers last year shipped to London throughout the
season. He sent peaches, apricots, nectarines, plums
and pears to that far market, all honestly selected
and securely packed, and on the whole season's ship
ments cleared a profit of $100 per ton. Now, it goes
without saying that if a California fruit grower can
clear that profit on as distant a market as London,
no one need fear the future of the fruit industry
here. Our climate produces such a variety of fruit
that there can never be a total failure. Every grower
can so arrange his plantation as to have something
for market.
Those who have been pessimistic about California
fruit growing should recall what seems to be an
economic law, by which the characteristic product
of every part of the earth is converted into the sup
port and often into the wealth of the people. The
corn crop of the upper Mississippi Valley did riot
cease because sometimes the growers burned it for
fuel in the winter. It has remained the mainstay of
that vast region, and whether distilled into highwines
or digested into pork and beef, has enriched the
farmers of the prairie States beyond the wealth of any
other class of the people.
Given the natural conditions for the best produc
tion of fruit which exist in California and only a
failure of the commercial instinct can prevent the
fruit crop doing for the California fruit planter just
what corn has done for the prairie corn planter.
Recent experiences point to certain needs of the
business. All crop farming everywhere is attended
by two incidentsâ the crop mortgage and cash ad
vance on a future harvest at high interest. When
Porter Brothers failed it was found that the firm had
several hundred thousand dollars out as advances
to the fruit growers. This is the wrong way and the
cc.tliest way to extend credit to that industry.
What is needed is a California fruit growers' bank
to handle th? fruit growers' deposits and extend their
credits economically and safely. It is not a new idea
to have a bank especially to handle the cash and
credits of an industry. The Hide and Leather and
Chemical banks of New York were founded for the
PROFIT IN FRUIT.

Vast as is the amount of money thus shown to
have been expended for diamonds during the past
fiscal year, the whole tale has not been told by the
treasury statistics. It is a comparatively easy thing
to smuggle precious stones, and it is very well known
that large numbers are brought into the country in
that way. In fact, the ease of smuggling is so great
that the Government dare not impose a heavy duty
upon imported gems, as experience has proven that
such, duties arc hardly more than bounties paid for
the encouragement of smugglers. It was for the
purpose of ridding the treasury of the expense of
trying to catch and punish sdeh smugglers that the
framers of the Wilson tariff put diamonds on the free
list. Every now and then some man or woman of
wealth and of high social station is detected smug
gling gems of one kind or another, and of course the
number of. those discovered is but a fraction of the
total number of persons who bring back with them
from Europe more or less jewelry that is never de
clared at the custom-house.
It has been noted New York that boom times
on Wall street are always followed by a boom in the
jewelry trade. The average American who clears up
a big winning on the street celebrates his luck by
buying diamonds for somebody, and during the high
prosperity of the last two years such purchases have
been enormous. In fact, diamonds are becoming so
common in New York that a gala night at the grand
opera" is like a universal exposition of gems and
jewelry. In the near future the American dame who
wishes to distinguish herself will have to put dia
monds on her chambermaid, diamonds on her coach
man, diamonds on her pet poodle, and then go her
self in unadorned elegance, free of gem or jewel of
AN illustration of the increasing wealth of the
American people, and incidentally of their
increasing extravagance also, is furnished by
statistics just published by the Department of Com
merce showing the importation' of diamonds and
other precious stones. The advance' in the value of
the annual importations has been rapid, and marks a
similar advance in the ostentation of the leaders of
our fashionable world.
A summary of the report of the Bureau of Sta
tistics says: "Prior to 1887 the total value of dia
monds and other precious stones imported in a single
year never exceeded $7,000,000 per annum. During
the prosperous years from 1887 to the panic year of
1893 the total gradually increased until it reached
$16,000,000. Then there was a sudden drop to
$5,500,000 in the. fiscal year 1894, and in 1896 the total
value of importations was only $2,200,000. Since that
date, with a growth of prosperity there has been a
steady increase, until in 1901 the total value of the
diamonds and precious stones imported was $20,000,
000; in 1902 the total was $23,000,000, and when the
final returns from all ports for the fiscal year which
ended on June 30 this year have been received the
total will amount to the enormous sum of
$30,000,000."

NEW HAVEN, July 17.â According to
measurements of the new comet Borelli.
based on photographs taken by Yale ob
servers, the tail of the comet Is at least
three million miles long. Professor Wil
liam L. Elkin. director of the Yale Ob
servatory, said to-night: "The comet la
the only Important one seen in the past
eight years, when Rordame was discov
ered. It is the brightest comet since
Smith's, about twelve years ago. Here
at Yale we shall not make any study of
it. as we do not have a great deal to do
with comets. It will be at its brightest
from now on until July 21, when it will
begin to grow dim as it get3 nearer to the
sun. It will probably be visible for the
next couple of weeKS, and just now la Just
about as bright as the polar star. It
passes the sun on August 21, when it
will be about thirty-one million miles dis
tant from that body. The photographs
taken last night show a long tall to the
comet which is not visible to the eye.
The negative shows this tail to be divided

According to the observations of people
who have made a special study of this

Men who are in close touch with the workings of
finance are well-nigh unanimous in favor of some
form of an elastic currency. The country is pros
perous, there is no danger of a panic, and yet the
situation is by no means comfortable. The very
abundance of the harvests that ought to promise
nothing but good to all renders the immediate future
doubtful by reason of the strain it will put upon the
banks to supply the money required to handle the
crops. It is a situation that repeats itself at every
crop-moving season. Last year it became so menac
ing that the Secretary of the Treasury was forced to
use public money to relieve the stringency in New
York. It is not impossible that a similar relief may
have to be undertaken again, despite the fact that
neither the administration, the banks nor the public
<!csire such a thing.
One of the principal bankers of St. Paul in a recent
address at the Minnesota Bankers' Convention is
said to have earnestly warned the convention and the
public of the serious nature of the situation. A
report of his speech says he mentioned that he
'â¢learned in Chicago a little while ago that counr
try bank balances at that point had decreased $10,000,
000 within a short time. All the city banks are re
porting much the same condition. The majority of
the country banks in Minnesota," he said, "are tied
up for money, and their balances are lower than -for
a long time; many bankets have invested and
speculated till they regretted it. Hardly a day
passes in this city (St. Paul)," he said, "but we learn
of some country bank in trouble. Several have closed
their doors in. the last three or four months." He
concluded that "there was never a better time for
bankers to look out a little than the present."
Similar warnings have been heard from all parts
of the country, uttered by men of established author
ity in the financial world. It is surely time for Con
gress to give heed to the facts. The country expects
prompt action in a matter of such pressing import
ance and will hail with approval the decision of the
President to call an extra session.
|->^ RESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S decision to call
I â * an extra session of Congress early in Novem
Â¦*Â¦ ber may be taken as evidence that he intends
to join issue with Mr. Cannon and others who de
clare that no currency legislation is needed by the
country. The call for the meeting of Congress may
be ostensibly for the purpose of procuring a ratifica
tion of the reciprocity treaty with Cuba, but that
issue is not likely to long engage the attention of
cither house. It is already virtually settled that this
country will not undertake reciprocity, and that all
attempts to press the treaty will be useless. The liv
ing issue before the two houses will be that of pro
viding for an elastic currency, and in that contest the
President will have behind him the support of an
overwhelming majority of the business world.
Senator Lodge, who has just had a conference
with the President, and who gave out the news of
the intention to call an extra session, is quoted as
saying that no particular financial measure was ad
vocated by the President during the conference, but
that he is deeply interested in the subject and that it
is his hope and desire that early action may be taken
by Congress to remedy the evils of the existing
financial condition. It appears from that statement
that the call is designed as much to promote currency
legislation as for consideration of the Cuban treaty,
and accordingly the administration may be counted
on the side of those who will make the fight for
prompt action.
AN EXTRA SESSION.
PERSONAL MENTION.
reily, made with the Pierson photo
graphic telescope on the evening of
Wednesday, July 15, by Messrs. Curtiss
and Albrecht, fellows in the Lick Obser
vatory. The exposure was one hour in
length. The tall of the comet is recorded
on the original negative to a distance of
fully 7 degrees from the head; in other
words, in length equal to about fourteen
times the moon's diameter. The difficulty
of copying and reproducing the delicate
structure of the tail is very great, and
the published results probably will rep
resent It as much shorter than this.
The very numerous straight lines on
the photograph, each about a half inch
in length, are the trails made by the
neighboring stars. The telescope was
constantly shifted in position to follow

The motion of this comet is unusually
rapid, at present being about 5 degrees
daily northwest. The head of the comet
is a fairly conspicuous object in the even
ing sky, being somewhat brighter than
a fourth magnitude star. Observers will
have no difficulty in seeing it if they
know where to look. In the clear, dark
skies of Mount Hamilton a short tail can
be seen projecting from the head in a
direction opposite that of the sun. The
photographic plate is so much more effi
cient, however, in recording faint objects
of this kind that we make no attempt to
secure visual observations of the tail. The
structure of the tail changes from night
to night. It is probable that the atten

twenty-four hours by an entirely new

t-v RESIDENT DIAZ, now serving his sixth term
w~"^ as President of Mexico, has just been nomi
â¢*â¢ nated for a seventh term by a convention of
what is known as the National Liberal party. Vir
tually it was a convention of the Diaz party and it
practically settles the question of succession. / There
will be no opposition. The National Liberals have
spoken and the rest of the country will make it unan
imous.
The one feature of interest in the proceedings
leading up to the renomination 6f the President was
the statement of Senor Bulnes in making the nomina
tion speech that no nation of which it can be said
that the Presidency of any one man is a national
necessity can be rightly called a republic. Such a
statement made on such an occasion is evidence that
the followers of Diaz are by no means satisfied with
existing conditions. Bulnes is reported as saying:
"The country is constantly hearing just praises of
the work of General Diaz, but it would like to know
whether the work is precarious, or permanent; a
work that will prove ephemeral, or a labor of definite
salvation." He went on to point out that a nation
cannot be based upon an individual, however saga
cious and patriotic he may be. A nation must be
based on law. What Mexico needs is an established
loyalty, not to Diaz but to constitutional principles
assuring equal rights, which will preserve at once
the strength of government and the liberties of the
people.
It appears that up to this time the most patriotic
of Mexicans believe they cannot get along without
Diaz in the Presidency, and the belief is not without
its justification, at least so far as appearances go.
Diaz has worked wonders for his country, but when
he is gone his example will serve as a precedent to
encourage less fit men to strive to hold the Presi
dency, term after term, for life. Great as may be the
need of Mexico just now for a strong man at the
head of affairs, it is questionable whether Diaz can
serve his country so well in office as he could by
imitating Washington and setting an example of vol
untary retirement as a proof that the republic does
not depend upon any one man. Mexican patriots, of
course, understand their country and their country
men better than outsiders can do, and they believe
Diaz to be a necessity of the time. It is, therefore,
up to them to hasten the establishment of law and
the infusion of sound principles among the. people?
so that when Diaz departs in the natural order of
human events the republic may survive him and go
on its way in peace and prosperity.
DIAZ AND MEXICO.
A London man is soon to be tried in a court of
justice because he attempted to commit suicide. If
it is the intention of the prosecutors to persuade the
fellow that his life is of some value they are creating
in his mind an absurdly exaggerated opinion of his
worth.
It may be that Mr. Sonnichsen forms his judg
ment upon intercourse with the Scandinavian and
other alien born sailors who man what American mer
chant ships we have. To judge fairly of the effect of
blue water upon the love of country felt by an Ameri
can one has to go back to the remote time when our
ships were manned by our own people, and every
American sailor, whether in the navy or the merchant
service, was under the spell of the legends of Paul
Jones, Perry, Decatur, Lawrence and the grim sea
fighters who made Columbia the gem of the ocean.
It is quite sure that the American sailors of that day
were as patriotic as their fellow citizens on shore
and felt no desire to exchange citizenship of this
country for the greater citizenship of the world.
It may be perfectly true that the aliens who have
taken their places have forgotten the land where they
were born without acquiring the love of any other.
They may have articled under so many flags that one
banner is the same as another to them, and that may
account for the slack allegiance to the laws of this
country sometimes shown by them. But we think
that patriotism is still the rule with the few real
American born sailors who linger as evidence that the
seafaring character of our people is not entirely lost.
This subject was discussed much during the Civil
War, attention having been called to it by Mr. Hale's
book, "The Man Without a Country." During that
examination of the power of patriotism over land and
sea it was found that a far larger percentage of army
officers, educated at West Point, deserted their flag
and fought against it, than of navy officers educated
at Annapolis. In the discussion for discovery of
reasons for this the conclusion was reached that
deep water cruising had on an American sailor an
effect exactly opposite to that stated by Mr. Son
nichsen. Instead of exchanging his sense of citizen
ship in one country for a greater citizenship of the
world he held it closer and dearer, and the flag that
he had seen streaming on far waters, where other
banners were given to the winds, became to him
more precious by contrast. So the sailors of the
ante-war time were not sectionalists. They really
knew no North, no South, and the flag represented
to them one whole, entire and unbroken nation.
Hence it was found that while army pfficers from the
Southern States left their commands and went into
the Confederate service in great numbers, navy of
ficers from the same States stood by the flag, because
they felt the national instinct stronger than the lands
men.
We incline to the opinion that if our merchant
fleets were manned by natives, as they were once, it
would be found that sailing many seas increased
rather than diminished their patriotic love of their
own country. The inquiry becomes of interest in
view of the effort to increase our merchant marine
and the steady enlargement of the navy. The heroic
Lawrence, whose tomb and tablet, inscribed "Don't
give up the ship," are within a few feet of the throng
on Broadway, New York, went out to battle with
misgivings because his hastily gathered crew were
mostly aliens and not Americans. We want on our
warships, not citizens of the world, but those, wheth
er native or alien born, who feel that the citizenship
of the republic is greater than that of the world.
MR. SONNICHSEN, who promises to become
the Marryat of the seas and to tell over
the story of Jack of these days, is authority
for the statement that sailors are devoid of patriot
ism. He makes claim for them, however, that in
their wide wanderings on the water they become
brothers to all men, with a fraternal feeling that in
cludes races and nationalities the landsman never sees.
As the writer puts it: "The sailor has lost his citi
zenship of country to gain the greater citizenship of
the world."
LAND AND WATER PATRIOTISM.
service of the industries indicated by their title.
They were sound banks and the industries which
they served profited by their existence. Other forms
of business have required special banks. The Wells-
Fargo Bank and its many branches were instituted
to do the business of that great express company.
The commission man or corporation, like Porter
Brothers, should not be the fruit grower's banker
nor handle. his credit. Such a corporation should
neither bank nor speculate, and Porter Brothers did
both.
When there is a fruit growers' bank the industry
will have another guaranty of prosperity.

fleet and the big Theben, which
left here April IS for the German home
port. Is hard and fast ashore near the
Straits of Magellan. The cabled report
of the disaster, which reached the local
agency of the line yesterday, is meager,
but contains the satisfactory information
that passengers and crew are safe. The
vessel and cargo, It Is thought, will be
ccme a total loss. The place where she
struck Is described as In Gray Channel,
In Smyths Channel, near the Straits of

45.9 feet in beam and 27 feet deep. She
was built in Germany in 1SS7 and is com
manded by Captain A. H. Schultz. She
was a pplendidly equipped vessel, with
comfortable quarters for passengers and
plenty of room for carrying all kinds of
freight. â¢
FOR the third time since the Kos
mos line has been running Its
steamships from Hamburg to this
port disaster has overtaken the
City Engineer Grunt ky yesterday issued
a statement of the plans of the new
sewer system for the city, which will be
undertaken if the citizens so decide by
I otlng on the proposed bund Issue In
September.
The total cost cf the new sewer system
is estimated at JT.^50.000 and the work
Â¦^vill probably taite some years to com
piete from the time it is commenced.
The condensed statement of the plans
r.ade by the City Engineer Is as follows:
The rlar.s of a. sewtr system about to be
submitted by the City Engineer as a basis for
the proposed bond 1efuÂ« conform in their main
features to the project voted upon in 1900. dif
fering from It. hon-ever. in the amount of
fewer work reoornmendul for immediate con-
Ftructicn ar.d in the cost estimate, which has
had to be ry>visÂ«-d throughout on the basis of
currr nt prices of material and current wages.
Among the departures from the lines of the
criminal project a change in the location of the
North Point main sewer, from New Montgom
ery and Montgomery streets to Second and
street*, may be noted.
The major porttcn of the sewage of this city
if at present discharged into the open water
way at Channel street and the rest at many
points along the city's water front. It is pro
jwed. under the project as submitted, to effect
the difposa.1 of the eew&ge by the delivery of
th? major sortion thereof into the swift cur
r*-me of the bay well oft ehore on the northern
:rcnt of the city. A pupplemental system of
*-.ewers for the southeastern section of the city,
with outtaul at Hunters Point, forms a part of
the project.
WILL IMPROVE CONDITIONS.
The large sewers now delivering eewags and
storm waters to the bay are to be retained In
â¢ vise for storm waters alone. Some of them, as
in the case with the large Division-Ftreet and
the Urannan-Ptreet Fewer?, will require m be
reconstructed in large part and extended. This
is " particularly true of the I>iviÂ»ion-street
M l Â»er, which has gradually bten destroyed by
finking into a yielding foundation until at the
present day It is in such condition that long
stretches cf it may collapse at any tme.
The proposed sewor system will not only bet
ter the present ocr-flltions in the Mission, where
annual overflows are the rule, but it w-lil im
"prove sanitary conditions throughout the city
l'T effecting quick disposal of sewage from the
densely populated section and by providing
main and outlet severs for many of those
, which are remote from the present center oÂ£
population.
Ocean View and FunnysiJe. Ir.gleside, Uni
versity Mound and other similarly located sec
tions will be given main sewers. Means of
st-wage disposal will also be provided for the
Sunset district and for the ocean slope region
northerly from Golden Gate Park.
In the lowlylr.g business sections of the
fity, by separation of sewage proper from the
ftcna waters. It is proposed to effect a service
tc a much lcwer level than is now possible,
and much annoyance cf flooding cellars through
back How of fixtures will be avoided. The
quick removal cf sewage and its disposal in a
tne'hod U-ajbt oflemsive and where it cannot be
come a menace to health are to be accom
plished by the rtmr-osed system.
.MANY MILES OF NEW PIPES.
The 6ewen. now to be built have an aggre
gate length of 120 miles, not Including the
cast iron force mains several miles in length
leading from the pumping ttatlnns. The new
brick sewers alone will have a length of about
TC miles, of which three miles are In tunnel.
Many mlies of old 6ewers are in addition to
tjiis new work to be remodeled or partially re
i .nstructed.
tome cf the prcponed work is cf a class that
If very expensive, owing to the fact that
KWm must be built In some of the sections
<*f the city which were at on<Â» time swamps Â«_r
nud fiat* and where a support on piles is
nÂ»>r-Â«>ssary.
The lareest wwer cf these required to be
at onre constructed will be the Division- street
ooBdatt for sicrm waters. The outfall section
r.f this conduit near its point of discharge at
Seventh and Channel streets has been planned
a* a conduit with three rectangular compart
ments, each J< l i feet wide and 8 feet high. >
< T.!y two cf thi-se compartments are to be now
constructed: the ether two when the greater
extent of Impervious area and a consequent
greater run-eft from the tributary district
makes the enlargement to full size necessary.
Of the tr.ain intercepting sewers, the largest,
longest and mort important will be the North
Foint main. This will be a circular sewer for
most ol li* Ungth, attaining a greatest diame
ter of 9^Â» feet in Ielais Creek Valley, above
Mission road, and termicatiEg with a long
s*K-tton rear the northern water front 8 feet
in diameter.
Citizens to Say f Improve
ments Shall Â£ Made at
Cost of $7,250,000.

they look forward to the coming visit
with much pleasurable anticipation. They,
have not forgotten the reception tendered
them seventeen years ago and are glad
to visit San Francisco once more. People
residing in this city and in other places
on the coast who have formerly lived In
Maine are making ample preparations to
give the visitors a rousing reception.
The hotel committee has secured ac
commodations for more than 6000 visitors
and is booking more every day. The re
ception committee is busy preparing for
the reception of the vast number of vis
itors on their arrival in this city and the
members of the committee who live out
of town axe equally busy making prepar
ations in their respective localities.
The Rock Island has been chosen as the
official route by the officers of the G. A.
R. of Kansas for coming to the encamp
ment. On the special train, which will
leave Topeka August 13, will be the de
partment commander and his staff, the
Women's Relief Corps and tho ladles
of the G. A. R. This train will make long
stops at Manitou and Salt Lake City.
West of Denver it will be run over the
Denver and Rio Grande.
The committee, after receiving letters
from all parts of the Eastern States in
forming it of the thousands who are com
ing to the encampment, makes the follow
ing calculation of the probable influx.
If only from 20,000 to 25,000 visitors from
the East and from abroad should come
here, there will certainly be half as many
more from the Pacific Coast States.
Though the greatest number will come
from near by cities, perhaps as many as
$50,000 from California, who will come to
this city for one or two days, especially
the days of the great parades. It will be
impossible for the restaurants to feed so
vast a multitude and there is fear that
many persons will have to wait hours for
a meal unless some extra provision be
made to feed those people. The committee
suggests that caterers apply in time to the
proper authorities for permission to place
lunch counters, booths or tents in cer
tain localities, near the principal thor
oughfares, where coffee, tea, sandwiches
and other light food and refreshments
may be sold to the hungry.
General Stone invites all persons in the
matter to call at headquarters. Grand
Hotel, and confer with the committee
upon a plan to provide for the immense
influx which is sure to come.
The Grand Army posts of the San Joa
qufn, Sacramento, Santa Clara, Napa
and Sonoma valleys are making
extensive preparations for keeping
open house In San Francisco dur
ing the week of the Thirty-seventh
National Encampment. The .display of
fruits and wine will be exceptionally large
and Inviting. In exhibitions of this char
acter there is bound to be a spirit of ri
valry between the leading counties of this
region of the State. The prospect of dis
plays in this city that will attract the
admiration of Eastern visitors is doubly
pleasing in view of the intelligence that
Los Angeles is making an effort to sur
pass all her former achievements in ex
hibiting the products of Southern Cali
fornia. Veterans who , purpose visiting
the encampment in San Francisco have
been invited to tarry a few days in the
city of the Angels. Reports from the
East indicate that there will be a pretty
general acceptance of Los Angeles hos
pitality. \
The question of feeding the vast in
flux of strangers during the National En
campment of the Grand Army in this
city is engaging the attention of General
Stone, chairman of the committee of man
agement, and the members of his commit
tee. In their opinion the influx of strang
ers during that week, from August 17 to
August 24, will probably be the largest
in the history of San Francisco and the
question of how to feed so many thou
sands in addition to the regular patrons
of our restaurants and hotels, they say,
should engage the attention of hotel pro
prietors, keepers of boarding-houses and
restaurants and caterers.

The Philaledlphla Press makes some
very friendly comments on Alex W. Pape,
who withdrew from the senior sculling
race owing to poor condition. The Press
says that "With his withdrawal there re
tires as true a sportsman as ever came
over the Rockies." Pape went to Phila
delphia several weeks ago to taXe part In
the American Henley. When he left San
Francisco he weighed 16S pounds and felt
vigorous. Before reaching Philadelphia
he had lost eight pounds. He began
training and four days before Henley day
had gone down to- 144 pounds. He went
about his training In a very conscientious
and unassuming manner and made many
friends. As soor. as he had got Into form
his rowing attracted the attention of all
the oarsmen on the river. The police
boat Rescue followed hlmdbwn the course
several times and those on board were
surprised to find that he covered the
Henley course in 9:20. One day he
covered one mile 550 yards In 9:13w On
the day of the race he went to the una
in apparently great form and the favor
ite. After rowing about a mile Ernes:
George, the Boston sculler, and Pape col
lided, George being considerably out o'f
his course. Soon after this Pape became
exhausted, and. after wobbling In his
shell, fell overboard. He was rescued, but
did not recover for an hour. When
weighed at the quarters of the Vesper
Boat Club he was found to be reduced
to 139 pounds, twenty-nine under his nor
mal weight. Pape said to a reporter:
"I haven't made good on my reputatiV^
this time, but I shall try again at the Na
tionals in August. In the meantime I shall
try to gain weight. The climatic condi

Â¦ The polo season, which is about to open
on this coast, gives promise. of being, the
: Mr. Gould' is 1 not a polo enthusiast 'to
the exclusion of , other healthful sports
and pastimes. For many years he has
been identified with* yachting ' and has
owned a number of crack boats. His lat
est acquisition Is* the turbine-driven yacht
Emerald, which enjoys the distinction of
being the, first vessel of her type to cross
tho Atlantic. She is a 500-ton vessel, 236
feet over all and 26 feet 8 inches beam.
The Emerald' is capable of steaming fif
teen knots an hour. She-crossed the At
lantic, in eighteen days, encountering
rough weather on the trip.
Mr. Gould has, naturally, gone in for
automobiling, but he. .uses his machines
for their utility rather tftan for -their ex
treme speed. "
The first requisite of a player is horse
manship, of a quality which the most dar
ing cowboy of the.plalns or the Cossack
of the steppes would envy. The. player
must be in perfect, physical . condition,
which means health.
Mrs. Gould enters heartily into the pas
times in which the members of her fam
ily take part. She watches every move in
the polo games with a mother's pride and
a mother's fearsâ pride in the superb
horsemanship of her young sons and fears
for their safety. After each period the
boys J Invariably ride at once to their
mother's side to receive words of praise
and of encouragement.
4n directing j the energies of his sons
toward polo Mr. Gould has undoubtedly
conferred lasting benefits on j them. This
most fascinating of the games of the fifeld
develops not only strength of - limb ' and
quickness of eye, but It brings out Â¦ all
the manly qualities required In. life's bat
tles. . . =V:vv:- ; iv/M â¢ â¢ Â¦< Â¦'Â¦:'Â¦ ; i
In addition to Mr. Gould, who plays
No. 1, it embraces Mr. Gould's
two young sons. Jay and King
don, who play, respectively, posi
tions 2 and 3, with Benjamin Nicoll
as "back." Without being- classed as
brilliant individual players, these four
have so perfected their team work as to
place them among the leading players of
the country.
Their greatest achievement this year
was the winning of the 1 national junior
polo championship on the field of the
Philadelphia Country Club on June 25.
The team work on this occasion was the
delight of the spectators, the four playing
with clock-like precision. The score was
14% goals to 6% -for their opponents.
Mr. Gould's polo establishment at Geor
gian Court is the most elaborate in Amer
ica and it Is probably not excelled by that
of any player in the, world. He counts his
ponies by the hundred and maintains
three fields. Two of these are for prac
tice, while the third is for match play.
Mr. Gould's sons have had the benefit of
the best Instructors in horsemanship and
In polo. A critical observer watches their
every move on the field arid at the. first
opportunity-points out any tactical mis
takes they may have made. It Is this in
struction which has made tho team play
as one man. -- .. - . -.< â¢ u' -â¢:,'.;:
AT once the most interesting and the
most remarkable polo team in all
America is that organized and cap
tained by George J. Gould, master
of Georgian Court, Lake wood, New

FINANCIER AND RAILROAD MAGNATE WHO, WITH HIS TWO YOUNG SONS AND A THIRD PLAYER RE
CENTLY WON THE NATIONAL JUNIOR POLO CHAMPIONSHIP IN COMPETITION \WITH THE CRACK
TEAMS OF THE EAST ON THE PHILADELPHIA COUNTRY CLUB FIELD. V
Charley Rellly's Los Angeles team Is
holding its own in second place and U
playing good ball. The team has under
gone a great change lately and many new
faces appear In the line-up. With the
three Princeton University men, the Hil
derbrand brothers and Steinwal' Los An"
geles should prove a dangerous 'factor in
the race for the pennant from now on
Butte still leads Los Angeles by about
tnrte games. .
The Butte team of the Pacific National
League still continues to lead by an am
ple margin and all through Its hitting
powers. In every game the Butte play
ers seem to land on the ball at will and
bat In runs when they please. The club
does not field well, but its sticking pow
ers make up for any deficiency in that
line. â¢ .
All the playera who were released by
the Pacific National League and who
Joined the Coast League seem to have
made good. Both Hogg ! and Thielman.
who were released by Seattle and Los
Angeles respectively, are pitching good
ball for Portland, and Messerly, the first
baseman, who was also released by L03
Angeles, seems to have made a good im
pression on the Portland fans by his
work at the initial bag. He is also hit
ting the ball well. None of these men
were considered fast enough for the Pa
cific National League.
"We are in this baseball war to win
and we will win. This meeting in Chicago
may-result in something. We are sure
to get an even break. Both John B. Cole
man, one of the directors of â¢ the San
Francisco club, and Manager Dugdale of
the Seattle club are on the ground and
they will look out for our Interests at the
conference and see that we get all that Is
coming to us."
Mr. Hart states that the Pacific Nation
al League is doing better than was at first
expected and- that not one of the club
owners has any complaint to make. All
the cities in the Northwest are drawing
big crowds, says Mr. Hart, and as long
as the teams play the kind of ball they

'â¢The Tacoma club has been making big
money in the Northwest since the season
opened and everything has gone on in a
satisfactory manner. I received a telegram
from J. T. Stebb, one of the directors of
the club, the other day, In which he as
sured me positively that the club contem
plated no such move and that it would
remain with the Pacific National League.
League Is very anxious to break away
from that organization and come Into the
Pacific Coast League. These rumors are
denied by Harry Hart, president of the
San Francisco club of the Pacific Nation
al League and one of the foremost mem
bers of the association.
"There is absolutely no truth In these
wild stories," said Mr. Hart In an Inter
view, "and I want the public to under
stand clearly the position of the Tacoma
club in this matter. None of the direc
tors of the club ever as much as express
ed a desire to enter the rival league, sim
ply because they would lose by the move.
T HERE have been rumors floating
I around to the effect that the Tacoma

The semi-annual election of officers of
the Alameda Boating Club was held on
Tuesday night at the clubhouse on Oak
land Creek. The following were elected:
Charles H. Smith, president; F. S. Cone,
vice president ; William B. Hlnchman,
secretary: Alexander G. Bell, treasurer;
Z. T. Thorning, captain;. B. G. Lyons,
lieutenant captain; Robert Horwinski,
sergeant at arms; Frank Browning, John
Hammond and A. Klhm, members of the
executive committee. Charles H. 'Smith
was elected president for the twelfth time
and F. S. Cone vice president for the
sixth term. W. B. Hinchman has held
the office of secretary since the club was
organized. Z. T. JThorning was re-elected
captain, this being his first time In the
club's history that a captain has suc
ceeded himself. The senior barge crew of
the club will go to the Astoria, regatta,
but no representatives will take part in
the Santa Barbara carnival.
Oarsmen will sympathize with Treasurer
A. G. Bell of the Alameda Boating Club
In the loss of his wife. Mrs. Clara Sophie
Bell died at her home, 1536 Mozart street,
Alameda, on Monday and was buried on
Wednesday afternoon. She was a native
of Woodland and had lived in Alameda
for the last fourteen years. She leaves
four children.
carnival of sports now being held
there. Though there would have been
no difficulty In securing crews, the
committee in charge of the Santa Barbara
affair did not give sufficient notice. At
least two clear weeks' notice was neces
sary' to enable the San Francisco and
Alameda oarsmen, who are in the em
ploy of others from whom leave to ab
sent themselves must be obtained, to
make the necessary arrangements. Then,
when a definite offer did come from the
officials in charge of the Santa Barbara
carnival. It did not provide a sufficient
sum to meet the carsmen's expenses satis
factorily. The sum of $200 was set aside
for rowing races and It was desired that
ten oarsmen should go from this city.
Though a special rate of $14 for the round
trip per man was made by the Paciflo
Coast Steamship Company, it is consider
ed that the remaining $C0 would be inade
quate for- all expenses beyond mere trans
portation.
The oarsmen felt, also, that two crews
are not enough to furnish interesting rac
ing, and did not wish to make a poor dis
play, which m!ght tell against their be
ing invited to take part In subsequent car
nivals. If the event should become an an
nual one. The traffic on the coast steam
ers is heavy at this season, and the ac
commodations that can be obtained at
short notice are scanty. So it was de
cided to pass the Santa Barbara event
by for this year and to await the report
from Astoria, where the ninth annual re
gatta will be held next month. This de
cision was reached at a meeting of the
regatta committee of the Pacific Associa
tion of the Amateur Athletic Union held
in the Emma Spreckels building on
Wednesday night.
The Astoria regatta bids fair to be an
unusually good one this year, as the citi
zens of that town are making special ef
forts. It Is promised that the oarsmen
will receive the best of attention and
quarters, and that there will be no ground
for complaint as to their treatment in
any respect. Good trophies are assured.
It is almost certain that barge crews
and single scullers from three or four of
the bay rowing clubs will accept tha of
fer of the Astorians and will take part in
the northern regatta. . A letter has been
Bent to Oswald West, secretary of the
Astoria_ regatta committee, with regard
to the number of barge crews and single

While returning on Tuesday afternoon
from a cruise up the Sacramento River
the schooner Muriel, flagship of the South
Bay Yacht Club, was run down In San
Pablo Bay by the submarine torpedo
boat McPIke. A large jagged hole was
made in the yacht. Just above the water
line, but with the assistance of the crew
of the McPike a tarpaalln was placed over
the hole and the yacht reached Oakland
harbor, anchoring off the California club
house. Charles P. Doe's schooner Chal
lenge of the California Yacht Club stood
by when the Muriel was injured and es
corted her to an anchorage. As the yacht
being under sail, had the right of way
over an cnglned craft, the collision Is
explained by the statement that the Mc-
Pike's steering gear did not work prop
erly when her captain tried to clear the
yacht.
Some of the California yachts returned

Joseph P. Herron, a well known leash
man of Kansas, has declared that he will
send out some good dogs to compete in
the Mg stakes that are on the cards.
C. Wedel's kennel has been ruled off
because of the queer work of Frisky Bob
at Ingleside. It is the Intention of the
management to force all cour3ing men to
live strictly up to the rules. The well
known courser Creswick has been rein
stated and will again be seen In the run
ning.
Cecil Lyons has sent word that he will
be represented here during the coming
season by a kennel of hounds with which
he expects to get a good share of tha
money In the bis stakes that are to be
run.
On Sunday next he will start some of
his coursers and will keep them in fu
ture stakes to prepare them for bis
events, and incidentally to win some easy
money. Curtis figures that with some
young doga that he has in training he
has a good claim on the Futurity and in
the John Grace Cup stake one of his dogs
will at least reach the finals.
A. R. Curtis has been out of the gama
for some little while and because of the
temporary closing of Union Park ha3
given his kennel of bread winners a much
needed rest. â¢- .-
The Futurity of this year will probably
show the finest collection of young grey
hounds that ever coursed on a field. Every
day trainers can been seen along tha
beach with a lot of youngsters prepar
ing them for the events that are to come.
Ladles* day Champion stake will be run
in August at Union Park with prizes that
are worth striving for. Such dogs as
Sacramento Boy. Palo Alto, Rector and
a strong representation from the Curtis
kennel will b<5 on deck to run for the rich
purse. This event is In the nature of a
preparatory run for the John Grace chal
lenge cup, and will bring out almost every
dog that will be entered in that big event.
While the prizes are not so large as in the
stake to follow, followers of the game
will have a chance to get a line on the
merits of the dogs which will compete in
the big stake.
During the next few months there will
be run soma events that will bring out
some of the finest dogs in the country.
The John Grace cup stake gives promlso
of being one of the richest events known In
coursing. Already the champions that
have been before the public for the last
few years have been brought In training
for this event and the coursing men of
the State are vying with each other to
get a portion of the valuable prizes.
Every leashman in the State 13 interest*
ed in this big meeting and the different
parks of California have agreed to mako
this the banner season so far as stake
money Is concerned. With the dogs that
have been imported from, the East and
the well known champions that have
coursed in the home parks there Is no
doubt that this year's event will be the
greatest in coursing history- Eastern
men have come to the conclusion that
with a dog that is fleet of foot and has
stamina enough to make a showing
against the wild hares that are liberated
in our local parks there is a chance to
make good money and new names can be
seen on the card every week, represent
ing some Eastern kennel.
NOW that the summer months are on.
coursing men are getting their dog3
in trim for the big events that aro
booked for the season. Throughout
the State the leashmen have readied up
their dogs to compete in the big stakes
that are soon to be brought off. Eastern
men realize that with the right kind of
dogs there is money to be made in Cal
ifornia and hounds of record are being
shipped to compete in the big stakes that
California is noted for.

ONE little tally, which Truck Egan
sent In ahead of him during the pro
gress of- the eighth round yesterday
afternoon, kept Mike Fisher and his
Senators In second place In the pennant
race. The home team pressed them hard
from the outset and not till tho last man
went out was the battle at an end. Score.
3 to 2.
All kinds of pretty plays were pulled off
during those nine rounds of action and it
was one of the hardest fought games of
the season. Every man on each nine
worked himself to the limit endeavoring
to win out. It was anybody's game at
every stage and a hit at the right mo
ment won it for the Senators.
.But the home team should have been
the victor. The bad Judgment of the
coachers on the lines In the fourth and
eighth rounds resulted In two being
caught at the plate, and then again In the
third Krug was thrown out by McLaugh
lln when he should have scored easily on
Meany's long fly.
The locals fielded perfectly. Not a
fumble did any of them make during the
game. But they were unable to hit young
Cutter at all when a hit meant a run.
They only landed on the youngster for six
and these he kept well scattered along the
route of the battle.
Uncle's followers landed one in the
fourth and one more in the next inning.
These two periods finished them for run
getting. On both occasions good, solid
hits by Pabst, Leahy and Krug did the
trick, aldedyrnaterlally by the four errors
the Senators managed to pile up at the
wrong time.
Sacramento made good with a pair In
the sixth on three hits by Hildebrand.
Egan and Townsend. Then they did not
do a thing with the bat till the eighth.
When Hildebrand hit past second and
McLaughlin sacrificed him on a step
farther. Egan tore oft one that barely hit
inside the line near the right field fence
and Hlldy registered the run .which kept
Fisher and his bunch in second place.
During the first inning a fast double
play prevented the Senators from getting
& man over the plate. Cutter led off with
a double to center field and Casey beat
out a bunt. Casey tried to steal second,
but was caught between the lines. Then

The match was to have been held in
the park courts, but it was decided to
hold it on the California courts and
charge an admission fee of 25 cents. The
proceeds' will bÂ« donated to the Pacific
States Lawn Tennis Association, which
is in debt. This Is considered a better
plan for raising the money than levying
an assessment, which it amounts to prac
tically.
The Park Commissioners decided last
week to build two asphalt courts in front
of the clubhouse at the park. ! This news
pleased the park players greatly, but they
were equally dismayed when they learned
that Park Superintendent McLaren would
not .move the two trees that are very
much in the way. Naturally he is averse
to cutting. them down, but they could be
moved to another part of the park with
out much trouble. â¢
Local tennis players are greatly inter
ested in the doings of Reuben Hunt in
the East. The latter, strange to say. is
obtaining better results away from home
and among supposedly better players than
he did on the courts on which he learned
the game. .Hunt has reached the finals
of the New Tork State championship and
the local cracks would be pleased to see
him gain more laurels. Hunt won the
Gulf States championship last year, and
also played a fine set match with Kreigh
Collins, the Western champion who was
For this reason the latter will be al
lowed a liberal handicap. They will re
ceive odds of "one-half of 15"; that is,
15 every other game. Allen and Smith
will play 15 back of scratch, which means
that the first point they make in each
game does not count. The scratch men
will play everything to Brady and the
latter will undoubtedly be kept busy dur
ing the match.
In the afternoon at 2:30 Stewart Gay
ness and Guy Lytton will meet the win
ner of the Allen-Smlth-Whitney-Brady
match in the finals. Should they meet
Allen and Smith the latter would be 15
back, while Gayness and Lytton would
receive 13. Whitney and Brady would
allow Gayness and Lytton "one-half of
15."* In either event Gayness and Lytton
are expected to give a good account of
themselves, as they have quite a snug
handicap, and played much better than
usual last Sunday.
Of the three teams left Allen and Smith
are the only ones who have won the cups.
If they win Sunday they will be tie with
the Hotchkiss brothers, who have two
wins to their credit. The cups have been
won once bv Routh and Dunlap and
Clinch and McKay. -
â¢ At 10:30 Sunday there will be an exhi
bition match on the park courts. The
contestants will be Professor Joseph
Daily, the crack professional, and S. H.
Adams of the California Tennis Club. The
latter named joined the Golden Gate Club
last week.
A match that is expected to excite un
usual interest is being arranged for a
week from, Sunday. The contestants will
be Professor Daily and Norman Hodg
kinson. It will be the first match played
by two professionals In the city. Daily
is a man who has been a wonder in his
day. but is getting along in years for an
athlete. Hodgkinson, on the other hand,
is a young man who is improving con
stantly and is in' fine practice. * The odds
seem to be In favor of the last named,
but Daily may be relied upon to make
some strokes that will surprise the spec
tators.
nament commenced on the park
courts last Sunday. Three teams are left
in the competition and it is expected the
two remaining matches will prove close
and excltins. In the morning at 11:30
"Will Allen and Grant Smith, the cup hold
ers, will meet R. N. Whitney and Jules
F. Bradv. The latter is rather an odd
combination. Whitney is undoubtedly one
of the strongest players in the city, while
his partner is several classes below.

pletion of the handicap doubles tour-

recently returned from "the Midway Isl
ands, \^ $:?*:Â¦%â¢Â¦?. Â¦-
During the present season four local
cricketers have made batting averages of
thirty or more runs. H. B. Richardson
has scored 262 runs, has been six times at
the bat, twice not out and has an average
of 63.50; B. Kortlang has been five times
at bat, twice not out and has a total of 170
runs, or an average of 56.66; G. Harold
Ward has been six times at bat, twice*
not out and has made a total of 190 runs,
or an average of 47.50; E. G. Sloman has
been six times at bat, twice not out and
has compiled 120 runs, or an average of 30
per inning.
: As in batting, so in bowling three of
the first four places on the list are taken
by members of the San Francisco County
Club. E. Petersen has bowled 138 balls
and taken 10 wickets for 51 runs, or an
average of 5.10 per wicket; E. H. Wilkes
has bowled 138 balls and taken 8 wickets
for 41 runs, or' an a/verage of 5.12 per
wicket; B. Kortlang has bowled 459 balls
and has taken 25 wickets for 155 runs, or
at an average cost of 6.20 runs per wicket;
j<\ J. Croll of Alameda has bowled 363
balls and has taken 18 wickets for 147
runs, at an average cost of 8.16. Harold
Ward of Alameda has bowled the largest
number of balls, 5C8, while B. Kortlang
(459), B. Bird (454) and O. N. Taylor (446)
are almost on an equality as regards the
number of balls sent down. Kortlang has
taken the largest number of wickets, 25,
and Harold Ward the next largest num
ber, 19. H. C. Casidy of the Pacifies has
bowled nearly as many balls as Harold
Ward, but the 15 wickets he has taken
have been rather expensive, having cost
14.33 runs apiece. It is fair to suppose
that neither of these players would have
bowled so many balls had they not been
captains of their clubs. In the list of the

ty Club has four names, the Alameda
three, the Pacific two and the Santa Cruz

While the Reliance managed to cross In
the lead, the Belmont boat was one sec
ond less than a minute astern, both boats
flying across the line under a, great press
of sails. The Columbia, in the meantime,
had been dropping quite rapidly astern
and was more than a mile away. The of
ficial time in the ninety-footer class was:

The Reliance beat the Constitution in
elapsed time by 59 seconds and the Colum
bia by 7 minutes and 21 seconds. Consti
tution beat Columbia 6 minutes and 22
seconds.
All the fleet, with the exception of the
racing nineties, were off .by 11:15, and fif
teen minutes were '"allowed the cup yachts
in which to maneuver.
The three boats went over the line on
the starboard taclc with ballooners set.
During the first. ten minutes the Reliance
and Constitution pulled by the Columbia
very rapidly, but fifteen minutes later the
wind fell almost flat. In the-drift the Re
liance again showed her splendid powers
in light fanning airs, and at 12:15 was half
a mile ahead of the Constitution and a
quarter of a mile ahead of the Columbia,
the latter having pulled up a bit." During
the next hoilr there was a fine tussle be
tween' the Reliance and' the Columbia,
and at one .time the latter "succeeded in
getting out ahead to the extent of about
a ; quarter of a mile, while the Constitu
tion dropped back until she was more
than a mile astern of the Reliance.
At 2 o'clock the Reliance had succeeded
in pulling by the Columbia, and twenty
miles from the start the Constitution also
went by the old cup defender to leeward.
Ten miles from the finish the Reliance
was leading the Constitution by nearly
three-quarters of a mile.' The breeze
proved fickle, however, and when it
dropped. if left the Reliance first, so that
the Constitution was able to draw up to
her, but could not quite catch her. Then
the breeze sprung up again and once more
the Reliance pulled away, only to be left
a few minutes after with almost flapping
Bails. When the wind hauled back Into
the south the ballooners were set for a
broad reach of five miles to the finish.
As the breeze strengthened astern the
Constitution gained rapidly on the Reli
ance. Two miles from the finish -she was
only a quarter of a mile astern and a
mile away from the line she had cut down
the Reliance's lead to 200 or 300 yards.
The new boat broke out her spinnaker
quickly in the hope of pulling away, but
the Constitution followed suit and was
almost blanketing the Reliance as they
neared the finish line. Â¦ .

An ordinance was recently passed here
by the Supervisors closing the poolrooms.
However, this is said to have been a

SANTA ROSA. July IT. â Hop condi
tions in Sonoma County are in a satis
factory condition, ana wnue there will
be a slight shortage in yield, it is prob
able the price will be higher and more
than compensate for the shortage. Pick
ing in this vicinity will begin about Au
gust 25, and lasts several weeks. Grow
ers in the vicinity of Russian River be
lieve that if a rain does not come short
ly they can only count on two-thirds of
a crop. Samuel W. Purrlngton and
Itayford W. Peterson, prominent grow
ers of this county, are trying the ex
periment of Irrigating their hop crop,
and expect more than an average yield.
Hop Conditions Are Satisfactory.
During the investigation it was devel
oped that Hooper occasionally made wag
ers at the racetracks and that* his wife
had been in receipt of a gratuity of J25
monthly from the society during the last
ten years of service of the accused offi
cer. . These facts aroused . the interest of
Commissioner Hutton, and at his- sug
gestion the Investigation was continued
until next Thursday afternoon, when fur
ther Inquiry -will be made.
The charges specified that during a pe
riod extending over four years the ac
cused policeman had reported to the so
ciety tho vehicle license number 11,836
eighty-three times as being attached to
wagons, the horses of which he had in
vestigated and caused to be sent to their
stables. The Inference sought to be drawn
from the frequency that the number oc
curred was that Hooper was not attend
ing to his duties, but was turning In these
reports without actually doing the work.
Many witnesses were examined,-Includ
ing Vice President Partridge. Secretary
Holbrook, Treasurer Hutchinson and Spe
cial Officer McCurrie of the society. All
of them gave Hooper a splendid record. â¢
On his iiwn behalf Policeman Hooper
testified that in every case reported : he
had performed the work specified, and
he thought the numbers given on the dif
ferent vehicles were correct. He stated
that many wagons were numbered arbi
trarily, by the owners to avoid arrest by
policemen, and that no license was paid
on them nor was any record of, them to
be found in /the license department. He
admitted that clerical- errors ' might be
partly responsible for the frequency with
which the number in question occurs in
his Â¦ records.
There was a special meeting of the Po
lice Commission yesterday afternoon. It
was devoted mainly to hearing the
charges of neglect of duty and making
false reports against Policeman W. B.
Hooper, preferred by the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, with
which organization the accused policeman
had been detailed for more than twenty
years up to within a few months ago.

senting to its disclosure after an inter
view with the mother. This was at the
conclusion of the Inquest. Mrs. Leveque
told the Coroner about rinding the body.
Dr. Carl E. Curdts explained the condi
tion of the body and the ropes he found
about it. Coroner Mehrmann said the ex
amination positively showed strangula

Nothing more was given the jury, which
found a verdict of accidental death and
added that the boy had been strangled
while playing in a swing. The Coroner
did not approve the verdict, on the
ground that the evidence did not warrant
the finding.

/oung James had been a scholar at the
Durant School. When vacation began he
went into his father's store. Yesterday
afternoon he went home about 5 o'clock
and laid his coat at the foot of the bed
in the room he and his father occupied.
He met Mrs. Leveque and spoke to her as
he left the house. Not a sign had he
given to his -father or any one else of the
contemplated deed. But he must have
gone then to the barn. 1 for the condition

When Patton went Thome to supper the
boy was missing. He was still missing at
8:30 o'clock' when the father retired. Pat
ton awoke between midnight and fl
o'clock this morning and then thought
his boy might have been arrested, but
his inquiry later at the police station gave
him no satisfaction. At 4 o'clock this
morning Patton went to market for his
day's produce, returned to his store and
at breakfast the mystery of the disap
pearance was solved by Mrs. Leveque.
George 13. Patton, the father, spoke as
follows concerning the hanging: .
What prompted James this time I ' cannot
tell. He had not been reprimanded, and seemed
cheerful and happy. It Is all a mystery to me.
At the Inquest this afternoon Patton
THE DAY OF THE DEED.
Mrs. Patton referred to statements that
the Rev. E. S. Brown, formerly pastor of
the Thirty - fourth - street Methodist
Church, had been the cause of difficulty
between herself and her former husband
three years ago.
The <leed was that of a boy born under the
caet of prenatal influences, which was -re
vealed before Jamie was out of his baLy
hcod. Twice before the child tried to end his
life. The first attempt wag when Jamie was
but 5 years old. He had been reproved, after
which he- went out to the barn and got a piece
of balerope and hanged himself on the limb
or a peach tree. Mr. Patton found the baby
in time to cut him down and resuscitate him.
We had hoped that our efforts to teach him
to live had been successful, for the years rolled
alone and the boy wan delightful. The symp
toms seemed to have disappeared but about a
year and a half ago In Oakland Jamie made
the second attempt and under similar condi
tions to that of seven years before. -One day
after a slight reproof he went out to the barn
and hanged himself. With like good fortune
Mr. Patton discovered him In time. We talked
lonÂ«r with him then and he promised us to
make no further attempts. There muet have
been some pnawlr.g at hU brain to bring about
thlE last. and fatal attack of melancholia, from
which he had suffered Intensely. Though Mr.
Pattor. and myself have been always good
friends, we have never been happy companions
Though we have been divorced we are still
pood friends. When I was given the custody
cf the children a realized how much affection
Mr. Patton had for them and I gave Jamie
Into his care, knowing that he would be given
good attention. And now I desire to deny for
myself and with the knowledge and assent of
my former husband who bears with me the
charges that have been circulated in connec
tion with this, trouble.
The sad mother spoke as follows:
Jamie vag a boy of peculiar temperament.
There was a strong touch cf the artistic In
him, yet from infancy he suffered under the
epcll of morbid melancholy that our utmost
efforts failed to dis-Del.
It Is absolutely false that the troubles be

BABY ATTEMPTS TO END ALL.
cord was hung a theory that the separa
tion of father and mother had so preyed
upen the boy's mind that in his despon
dency he had gone to th<i last extreme.
There the record stood until the mother
arrived in Oakland. From her lips, with
the tears wetting her cheeks, came the
story of her child's blight. At her side
sat the grief-stricken father. The di
vorced parents cf the unfortunate dead
were by a common sorrow drawn toward
each other as the mother unfolded the
secret of their first bora's sorrow, a se
cret . that had been for years buried in
their hearts.
Around this narrative of domestic dis-
StOTHEB TELLS THE STOBY.
The Pattons were not compatible. After
nine years Mrs. Patton commenced di
vorce proceedings at Healdsburg, but sub
sequently withdrew them. Six years later
her action was pressed to a conclusion
here and last October Judgj* Greene
granted Mrs. Patton a divorce on the
ground of cruelty. She was given the
custody of her children, James and
Frank, but she allowed the father to have
J.'.ir.ff;, and ever since the separation Pat
ton had lived with his boy In Oakland and
Mrs. Patton went to San Francisco and
engaged in giving physical culture les
sons.
PAEENTS DBIFT APABT.
Both father and mother, keenly realiz
ing the distressing conditions, made brave
efforts to check the tendency eo plainly
evident. The cloud that hung over the
boy could not be dissipated. Only a year
and a half ago, when James was just
touching his teens; the second effort was
made. Strangely, too. he used the same
means that were utilized last night.
Again, as in babyhood, the child's life
was saved by a timely discovery.
Pathetic was the story from the lips
of the child's mother, herself a double
sufferer because an unfortunate domestic
difficulty had separated her from the
boy's father and from her children. James
was the older of two boys, the fruit of
the marriage In 1SS7, In Illinois, of George
E. Patton and Alice M. Hoxsey. The
mother was but 19 years old when James
was born. Before his birth she suffered
from melancholy, and her son was born
with that blight upon his life.
TBIES TO CUBE THE BOY.
FINDS DANGLING BODY.
With a cry of horror, the searcher
rushed back to the house and aroused the
father. Patton. with .C. E. Irving, a
neighbor residing at Thirty-fourth and
Market streets, whom the parent had
called, soon verified the discovery-
Quickly Coroner Mehrmann responded
to a summons and cut down the boy's
body, finding in its position and the noos
ing of the rcpe what he declared was un
mistakable evidence of suicide. The Cor
oner's judgment was fully vindicated in
the remarkable story that the parents of
the dead boy told to-day in explanation
oT his suicidal deed.
Born with the taint of melancholia upon
him, marked by a strangely manifested
psychological phenomenon; the boy James
at the age of 5 years tried to end his baby
life by hanging.
The bov's unusual absence last night
had much distressed the parent. Mrs.
Lereque. full of anxiety for the missing
boy, bethought herself of the barn. There
young James had his petsâ rabbits,
guinea pigs and squirrels. And there he
had played and romped with his compan
ions. The distressed woman went to the
email "lean to" that faced the rear of
the dwelling. Peering in the door she
discerned the hanging body In the dimly
lighted, dusty room.

night by hanging himself In a barn at
the rear of 102 Thirty-fifth street, where
he had lived with his father, George E.
Patton, a grocer at 1720 San Pablo avenue.

knotted rooe that was twisted taut about
the nock, and was slipped under a thigh,
was found this morning by Mrs. Nellie

ELGIN, 111., July 17.â Because a well
known resident of Elgin called on the
wife of a retired farmer during the lat

lynch him. The young men who planned
the affair were foiled, and the police kept
the mattpr Quiet until to-day.
Late last night the man emerged from
the house of the woman, to whom, it is
alleged i he is paying undue attention,
and started for his home, about a mile
distant. Across the street were five young
men; friends of the absent husband, who
had adjusted a rope on a neighboring tree.
Three of their companions, who hid in
the tall grass near a house on the oppo
site side of the street, hurled atones at
the offender and chased him into the arms
of the other young men. He was lassoed,
and put up a strong fight. 1 He cut the
rope and charged into the crowd with
upraised jackknife.
A riot call was sent to police headquar
ters and five bluecoats responded. They
found the man semi-conscious and took
him to his home. Warrants will be issued
for the wou'.d-be lyn'chers.

and prices declined. Chile Peppers were of
fering freely but Bell were very scarce and

of Green Corn were liberal and Included a lot
of poor and wormy stock, which dragged at >

NEW TORK. July 17.â The recovery in
prices of securities, which was interrupted
yeÂ«terday by the late slump in Amalgamated
Copper was resumed to-day. It showed some
r-e*!t_tio?i at various times owing to the un
settled effects of rudden breaks in tpecial
clocks. But it KS.thered force as the day pro
jrrensed and at the final hour the whole market
was lifted between 2 and 3 points over lad
night. New York Central and St. Paul led
the Â»dvs.ncÂ«Â». but rains of 2 points or more
mere secured by Pennsylvania, Reading. Erie
first rre'erred. Illinois Central. Union Pacific,
Atchison. Amalgamated Copper and Kmeltlng.
Amor.* the inactive stocks there were some
lsrirer ratr;Â». which represented recoveries
from recent correspondingly \-lo!ent declines.
The opening advance In the market was first
checked by a renewed attack on Amalgamated
Ccpper. which carried it back to yesterdays
low record level. Kut the stock showed deter
mined resistance and became strong, notwith
standing Â« rf-r-ort of an additional cut In the
price of thÂ» product. Another barkset was
caused by th<> drop m Sugar to 194 below last
night, which followed the announcement of a
riee in the price In the refined eucar and was
without other explanation. Colorado Fuel
thÂ»r> made s violent slump o? 6% points to the
low price for the year. Â«nd this break was fol
lowed by a break in Toledo, St. Louis & West
ern Â«ecurlt!e*. which cost the. common stock
6% points, the preferred 7% and the 4 per cent
bonds 2%. Bock I*!and was the last stock to
ehow notable weakness and its decline r.t 1%
ended the resistance to the advance In the
fetieral market. The market was not notably
affected fcy tr.y of these breaks, and this
caused an imprÂ«Â»B*!on that covering movements
on a large seal* werÂ« going en under co\ - er of
th* depression in spot*. This pave color to the
*uppoÂ»' that the occasional breaks were
due t .raiding tar-tirs, although there were in
dications r>f the closing out of some accounts
fo>- forced liquidation. The general feeling; over
th* .money outlook wan brighter and rumors
were eirrulsted with luEslgnM authority that
rr.sny propo'M loans by railroad corporations
hsd been postponed. Â»tlmates of the week's
<*urrency movements pointed to a net gain by
thÂ»- banks of Â«'ver t3.ono.ooo. Thin rife In In
terest ratÂ«a here reerns to have induced a large
inflow of currency from interior poinU and the
Sub- Treasury madÂ» heavy dlsbureemenU yes
terday and to-<Jsj- for â¢p^clal accountc. thus

The rate of 33 1-3 cents per hour would un
der this demand constitute the minimum rate
of the carmen's pay. On the basis -of wages
raid platform men for the year ending March
31 1903 ($1,237,683. CO), the rate of 33 1-3
cents per hour alone, without reference to the.
higher rate resulting from short time runs,
overtime, etc. would Increase the payrolls for
one year by $420,227 87N
The average rate of pay, taking Into con
sideration the number of employes In each
class resulting from the wage schedule now
submitted by the company, is found to be
23.67 ceflts.
The increase In the present rate of pay of
platform employes now demanded by the
union would result In an Increase in the yearly
payroll as compared with the rate submitted
by the company of M97.9O4 32
The additional rate for overtime and short
time runs we estimate would amount to about
iiss 860*26 which would make a total in
crease In the payrolls of platform men of
$GS0.764 68 per year.
/ The above calculation only takes into consid
eration the demands for Increase tn pay of
platform men alone, while the demands of thÂ«
house and track men. also submitted, it is es
timated would Â¦ Increase the payrolls, of the
company a further amount of approximately
$132,638 3L .
The cas? will be resumed Monday morn
ing at 10 o'clock.
THIRTY-THREE MINIMUM.
A further inspection of the payrolls of the
United Railroads for the quarter year ending
May 0, 1903 of 01 Jays, shows that out of 1S38
platform employes of the company during that
period. 604 .are. earning and receiving from
$S0O to $920 and over per annum; 617 are
earning wages of from $700 to $800 per an
num, while the average pay of alt platform
men. based upon a three months' service with
the company, is about $730 per annum, as per
United Railroads' exhibit No. 3.
The wages earned and received, as noted,
would be materially greater except for the ab
sence of carmen from work, caused by sus
pensions from oversleeping and other viola
tions of rules, absence on leave, absence
caused by sickness, being given light runs by
request or being transferred temporarily to
other occupations.
To obtain a fair comparison with the wages
earned by the platform men during the. early
portion of the present year â an average was
taken for the months of February, March and
April, 1903 (SO days) â under the same condi
tions and a proportion added to allow for the
one day less in the period, resulting in average
wages of $173 17 per employ*, as compared
with $147 24 for the same length of period of
fw> davs in the year previous. Â«n Increase of
17.6 per cent. This increase, confirming the
previous estimate of 17.4 per* cent, is much In
excess of the average -increase In the rate of
the carmen's wages and is due to a readjust
ment of the time schedules of the company
with direct benefit to the men In the way of
Increased wages resulting therefrom in addi
tion to the Increased "rate."
The demands of the platform men now under
discussion Involve among others, a rate of $3
per day for nine hours of labor, which is at
the rate of 33 1-3 cents per hour, but which
does not take Into consideration the higher
wages claimed for overtime work nor for
short time runs, which would materially "In
crease the rate above noted.
"The list of such employes will be. revised
on the first day of January of each year, so as
to add thereto the names of men who at that
time shall have completed terms of continuous
service as above state*; attention being called
to the .fact that hereafter no new names will
be added except for continuous service.
"The board reserves the right to annul, re
scind or amend this resolution at Its pleasure."
The amount so expended as a bonus to old
employes Increased the average rate of pay of
the carmen of that company to 22.674 cents
r>er hour.
In the negotiations with the Carmen's Union
during the strike period of last year (April) the
company offered to pay either a minimum wage
of 23V.I cents per hour and continue the bonus
system Inaugurated by the Market-street Rail
way Company, or to pay a flat rate of 25 cents
per hour to all employes, as the men might
elect. They refused 23 cents and a bonus,
and accented the latter proposition of a 25
cent flat rate, which went into effect April 27,
1U02, the new rate being 10.SS per cent tn ex
cels of the average rate previously prevailing.
INCREASED PAY.
"In recognition of and as special reward for
faithful service the board of directors of the
Market-street Railway Company does hereby
authorize the general manager to pay a bonus
at the end of each month to conductors, mo
tormen and gripmen. beginning with the month
of March next, in accordance with the follow
ing scale:
â¢â¢To all such employes who on January 1.
1900, had been in the employ of this company,
including its constituent companies, for five
years. 1 cent per hour; for ten years. 2 ceflts
per hour; for fifteen years, 3 cents per hour;
for twenty years. 4 cents, per hour.
"The above regardless of whether said length
of service was continuous or not.
BONUS SYSTEM.
Market-street Railway Companyâ 22 cents
per hour, with 30 cents for all overtime work
beyond the working day of twelve working
hours, occasion for which, however, but rarely
occurred. That company, furthermore, as a
special reward for faithful services, paid a
bonus to the platform men. commencing March
1. 1900. as authorized by resolution reading as
follows :
During the above-mentioned periods I had
charge of the accounts of the said company or
companies and also of its or their various rec
ords. As such custodian I am familiar with
the wages paid by the constituent companies of
the United Railroads of San Francisco, hav-.
Ing had Immediate charge of the payrolls of
the Market-street Railway Company and the
payrolls of the other constituent companies of
the United Railroads being on file In my office
and In ray custody since April 1, 1902.
h The wages paid by the constituent companies
at the time the United Railroads of San Fran
cisco assumed control were as follows:
Railroads of San Francisco, having held that
position since March 31 and April 1, 1902, at
which date the present company assumed the
operation of Its respective roads. Prior to that
date and since April "13, 190O, I occupied sim
ilar, offices with the Market-street Railway
Company, one of'the constituent companies of
the said United Railroads.
. The witness having testified that the United
Railroads .would not have asked for a reduc- I
tlon of the old wage-rate of platfoim men had
industrial peace been preserved. I sought to
obtain from him an admission that industrial
peace has been preserved, this arbitration pro
ceeding being -a --peace proceeding and not in
the nature of strike, boycott or Industrial war
fare. He was so eager to avoid any frank ad
mission of the sort suggested, without coup
ling with an admission such qualifications as
should destroy its value, that he sought to
convey the Impression that so far os the ar
bitration is a peace measure that measure
must be credited to the United Railroads
rather than to the Carmen's Union. The truth
being that arbitration in its true c.nse was
first proposed and definitely urged by the Car
men's Union, and only reluctantly accepted by
the United Railroads, as the correspondence
before the arbitrators abundantly shows, I
sought from the witness a candid statement
doing justice to the union in that rrrard. I
drew his attention to the fact that the United
Railroads proposed that Mr. Calhoun and Mr.
Mahon Â¦ should consider the disputes affecting
the street railway men, but that the union hau
objected that since Mr. Calhoun was a party
in Interest and Mr. Mahon likewise, true ar
bitration required that a third man should be
agreed on as umpire, whose position would be
disinterested and whose vote should decide dis
putes, where the other gentlemen should be
unable to agree. He appeared to evade ad
mitting the fact in this connection and sought,
it seemed to me, to leave the record, so far as
he could, representing his corporation as the
father of thÂ« arbitration rather than ;he union.
When I pursued him. for the. truth as to Mr.
Calhoun' s interest in the caseâ as < to Mr. Cal
houn' s Â¦ financial relations toward the United
Railroads and the New Jersey corporation
Which is the sole stockholder of the United
Railroads â as to Mr. Calhoun' r part In the deal
resulting In the acquisition by the United
Railroads of street railway properties in this
city â he fenced In a fashion I deeme-1 discred
itable with my knowledge of the facts and my
knowledge of his subserviency to Mr. Calhoun
In all these arbitration negotiation? and pro
ceedings. So far as my manner was adverse
it was Intended to be Â»jver*, for I have small
patience 'with manifest unfairness; nor does
my patience increase when to untiirness of a
witness is added affected indignation of coun
sel. '
MOORE REPLIES.
To. this Attorney Moore at once replied:
I have not prepared any objection Â¦ but will
briefly say that If this case was being heard
in a court of law the witness would be pro
tected from anything .approaching loud talk-
Ing or charges of e.vasion. Whoever presides
in a court see* that the witness Is protected.
All else I have to say is that if/ I thought for
a moment that this interruption would have
caused so much delay I would never have ob
jected. . . - - .
President Holland then' took the stand
and all through the . afternoon Livernash
was more guarded in his examination.
His testimony was about the same as dur
ing the last few days, the only new inci
dent' being .that' he ' positively asserted
that he would, not have . presented a lower
schedule of wages for. the. arbitrators, to
consider If ttie carmen had remained with
their present rate' of. wages and had not
asked for an advance to $3 a day for nine
hours', work. He describe^ the new re
quest as an j action to< disturb the. indus
trial '; peace. â¢' After three entire days on
the stand President Holland was excused
by ; Livernash. ,', ' Secretary "Willcutt of the
United S Railroads j was then called ' and
read;the following, statement: . .
WILCUTT>S; FIGURES.
I am secretary and controller of the United
"Even so, you are not justified in brow
beating hinv" returned Moore.
"I \ will not allow you to say that I am
insulting a S witness," said Livernash.
At this juncture a recess was taken and
both sides refused to continue the case
unless Judge Murasky was present. '
In the afternoon, when Judge Murasky
took his. seat, Livernash made the follow
ing statement:
NO BROWBEATING.
"Your witness is perfectly safe from any
personal, attack on my account," said
Livernash. "The witness is- studiously
avoiding my questions."
"I want some method of protecting my
witness from personal attack," answered
Moore. \ 'Â¦ Â¦
. "I am tired of this gallery: play of op
posing counsel, shouted Livernash; "the
witness^ makes, me very weary and the
taking of his testimony is not to be di
verted by . by-plays to the press and the
public." â¢
President Holland was the first witness,
and his demeanor showed him to be a
man that cannot be shaken after he has
once expressed his views. This nettled
Livernash, -who was evidently determined
to cause trouble. To this end he began
to parade the Imaginary -2000 farmhands
that are to supplant carmen in the event
of a strike. Then came the touchy
point, about Patrick Calhoun.
"Now, Mr. Holland, is Patrick Calhoun
your superior, and would you obey his
commands?" asked Livernash.
"No, I do not take orders from Mr. Cal
houn,'' replied Holland. *
"I notice that you every beck
and nod of Mr. Calhoun when he was out
here," continued Livernash. "Now, Mr.
Holland, are you making a true statement
of facts? I had top much to do with Cal
houn when he was out here, and I differ
with you. He came out here for a spe
cial purpose and you know It."
Moore thought that Â¦ the matter had
gone far enough, so he swung into line
with: '
VI insist that the witness shall be re
spectfully treated. I shall call at once for
Judge - Murasky and ask him to protect
the witness." t- .
TBOUBLE STABTS.
The carmen's cqunsel repeatedly Insinu
ated that Holland was evading questions
as to whether Calhoun was or was not his
superior. Moore objected to what he
termed the browbeating of his witness.
One word brought on another,-Â»and every
moment Livernash became more excited.
At last. Moore refused to go further with
out Commissioner F. J. Murasky's pres
ence. A telephone message was sent to
Judge Murasky,: but pressing legal mat
ters held him. In the. courtroom until 2
o'clock. Moore then consented to
tinue, but a hitch was caused by Liver
nash, who said that he would not proceed
without the 1 ; presence of Commissioner
Murasky.
An adjournment was taken and at -2
o'clock Commissioner Murasky arrived.
After stating that he wished it understood
that he would no nothnig 'more than ad
minister oaths, as. he originally agreed to
do, he suggested that counsel should re
frain from arguing and the case proceed
ed.
Â¦Â¦ The arbitration proceedings between the
Carmen's Union and the United Railroads
broke up in a wordy row yesterday, morn

On "Wednesday last Rev. Dr. Robert

city, and one of the best known clergy
men In California, was stricken with apo
plexy. He tad Just boarded a California
etreet car at Montgomery street on his
way to his home.
The conductor, who knew his passenger.
Eaw that something had gone wrong, so
be stopped the car at once. The sufferer
wa6 not able to speak nor to rise from
his seat, so the conductor and the grip
man carried him to his homeâ 2123 Cali
fornia streetâ and a physician was called
without delay. The patient has not been
conscious since reaching his home, and
the case is extremely serious.
The gravity of the attack is increased
by the fact that the patient suffered from
a similar seizure three years ago. At that
time he was compelled to abandon his
work for some months. His health im
proved so much after his rest, however,
that he resumed his labors and had never
ceased working up to the moment of the
second ftroke.
Dr. Clarke yesterday called In Dr. de
Vecchi as a consulting physician, and aft
er a conference it was agreed that the
patient was in no way improved. His
left eice is completely paralyzed and he
remains utterly lost to outward- impres
sions. Dr. de Vecchi pronounces the case,
unless a miracle intervenes, necessarily
fatal.
The news of the eminent pastor's con

beyond the limits of Grace Church, of

she makes a serious charge against Attor

he would not apply for distribution of the
estate without giving them notice, and
then did so, and that he also promised he
would not charge the estate for the ser
vices of Attorney Gleason, his brother-in

he wou'.d receive as executor. This prom

THE second day of the jubilee cele
bration of the Young Men's
Christian Association brought to
gether the boys of the associa
tion all bronzed, sturdy and smil
ing after their beneficial outing for sev
eral weeks at Camp McCoy.
A. Claude Braden, secretary of the
boys' department, presided, and after a
prayer by Secretary Cleaver of the Young
Men's Christian Association at Los An
geles the boys sang several hymns and
then the Rev. Frank S. Ford, pastor of
the First Christian Church, delivered an
address.
Mr. Ford's idea was to Ehow that the
raw material of a boy or man did not
represent the value of the product. The
raw material, alluding to a young man,
was, he said, 23 pounds of carbon; lime,
21 pounds; phosph rus, 22 ounces; and so
dium, iron, potassium, magnesium and
silicon, 1 ounce each; oxygen. 500,000 cubic
feet; hydrogen, 100,000 cubic feet, and ni
trogen, 52 cubic feet.
As an illustration that the raw material
did not represent the value of the pro
duct, Mr. Ford said that Millet, the ar
tist, paid 1 franc fof canvas. 2 francs for
brushes and color, in all, 60 cents, in paint
ing "The Angelus," but, he said.' that did
not represent the value of the picture,
which was sold for JIOS.OOO.
Mr. Ford said that P. B. Frisk, the
writer, had computed that a good boy at
the age of 15 years had cost his parents
$50iÂ«J, and if given a college education
after that $5000 more must be added. A
bad boy, according to Frisk, cost double
those sums.
VALUE OF A BOY.
That, said Mr. Ford, was only the
money cost of a boy. If, he said, they
were to compute the value â¢ of- a boy's
worth when Invested he was of tremen
dous value. Mr. Ford said that- a writer
in one of the magazines had an article on
"Niagara Kails and an Incubator â¢ Baby."
in- which the author compared the dy
namic power within the incubator with
the tremendous mechanical power sup
plied by the Falls in the Pan-American
Exposition at Buffalo, concluding that the
baby was the greater in power.-
Then, said Mr. Ford, the difference be
tween the value of pig â¢ iron and watch
springs was Just the value of a man. Raw
material,* plus may, he said, equaled the
commerce, mechanics, art, science lind in
vention of to-day. â¢ :
THIS LIFE NOT THE
The difference, said Mr. Ford, between
the world of Noah and the world of to
day was Just man's value. This was not,
however, the complete value, for. said
Mr. Ford, this life was not the end. He
said, further, that Christ had taught that
a man had much greater value for eter
nity than for time and that the man who
could administer ten talents here shall
rule ten cities' there. *
In conclusion, the reverend gentleman
a?ked what they, the people and the boys,
were going to do about it. ' If a boy | was
worth bo much, not only in cost but in
actual value," what, he. asked, were the
churchesi the association and the govern
ment going to do about it?.

the opening of a reformatory that if only
one boy was 'saved by the Institution ail
