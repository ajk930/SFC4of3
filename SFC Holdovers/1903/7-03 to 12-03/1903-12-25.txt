The criminal branch of the Court of
Cassation is composed of sixteen mem- '
bers, presided over by M. Loew, v.ho !
has participated in many of the most j
prominent trials of recent years. Many '
persons are in doubt as to whether this |
court can definitely decide the question j
of Dreyfus* restoration to the army, j
some authorities holding that under the j
law the rehabilitation of officers must .
h<? determined by the Council of War. j
A prominent official, however, said to- !
night that he expected the decision cf !
the court would he accepted as final.
Dreyfus did not desire that his nw j
trial should be conducted by a civrl (
tribunal, as he was anxious to again j
'po before a court-martial. M. Mornard. '

"Dreyfus before the Court of Cassation, i

His counsel will szain demand a mill- i

At the home of former Captain Dr<?y- j
fas the decision was expected, and
preparations are mw being made to j
convince the court of bis Innocence. J
Immediately upon the receipt of the
report cf the commission the Govern
ment will transmit ail the documents In
the case to the procurer general of the
Court of Cassation. These documents
include the modified testimony of M.
Gribelin. tho principal archivist of the
headquarters staff, who, at the court
martial at Rennes, testified that he
believed Dreyfus was guilty of treason,
hut w^o h2s now altered h!s evidence
so as to throw the blame upon Colonel
Hern*. i
Dreyfus received the news of the de
rision of the commission through per
sonal friends, who extended to him
their earnest congratulations on the
victory. The public was compelled to
wait for its information until the regu
lar editions were issued.
ThÂ» few persons who were at the
Ministry of Justice saw the members of
the revision commission depart shortly
after 6 o'clock, apparently glad that
they had completed their task. There
Â¦was absolute unanimity among the
members of the commission. One mem
ber asserted that on the facts present
ed as the result of the investigation
made by Captain Targe, an officer on
the staff of War Minister Andre, an
other revision of the case was made
possible.
The details in the report of the com
mission have not yet been made public,
but it is stated generally that the pro
duction of evidence which had not been
submitted to the court-martial at
Rennes and the charge of testimony of
pome of the witnesses before the cburt
martial, which entirely reversed: thÂ»
view as to the guilt of Dreyfus, brought
about the decision of the commission to
reter the case for retrial to a civil tri
bunal.
Th* submission of the question of re
vision to a commission is considered in
France as a tactful move on the part
of the Government to obtain judicial
support for Its favorable attitude to
ward Dreyfus. Moreover, as the pro
ceedings cf the commission have ex
tended over four weeks the first excite
ment disappeared and the people had a
chance to coolly consider the action of
the Ministers.
Though it had been announced that

Kehl's particular delusion was about
"the ideal ship." a general barge arid
swimming propeller which he regarded
as the most important of his forty in

Government for his patents! also to
form a series of stock companies to
manufacture and market his products.
"You Will be sorry if you do not see
me, for I will .find you and kill you,"
he 'wrote.

evening Kehl was located at a small
hotel and taken to police headquarters.

he made an attempt to draw a revolver

Officer Lane, who accompanied Constable Medlin to the city with the
prisoners, made the woman open her trunk at Bakersfield. As she tumbled
the clothes out the officer's suspicions became aroused. At Barstow he
again looked into the trunk. He was surprised to find wrapped in the
clothes the head of a human being. Lane was too confounded to make
much of an examination, but he wrapped up the head and closed the trunk.
When asked where the head came from, the woman said that she had
bought it of an Indian for good luck.
SAN BERNARDINO, Dec. 24.â Trinidad Figueroa and Miguel Antonio,
the alleged Needles murderers, were brought to Saji Bernardino this morn
ing. From evidence the officers have in their possession, it, ?s- believed
that the mixed Spanish and negro woman and the Cuban negrs, Antonio,
have many murders to account for. It is believed that the horrible murder
of the Chinaman, Lee Gar, at Needles last Sunday was only one of simi
lar crimes that may be laid at their door.
The Â¦woman evidently has lost all horror of crime, if she ever had any,
for in her trunk the officers have found the head of a human being.
Around the gruesome object the woman's clothes were wrapped.
Constable Medlin arrived 'from Bakersfield this morning, having in cus
tody Antonio and Figueroa. Lite to-night the woman made a confession to
the effect that her husband, assisted by a Cuban named Detro, com
mitted the murder at Needles and that fche and a woman named Maria Wil
son witnessed the deed. ' When seen this morning she persisted in denying
that she knew anything about the crime, but finally declared that Miguel
Antonio took the life of the Chinese.
"We keep house at Needles," she said, speaking brokenly, "and I send
rronev to the home at San Francisco, where I have two little children by
my first husband. I know nothing about how that Chinaman was killed.
He was not employed by me. When he came my husband took him into
the room and locked the door. I know nothing about his being killed.
â¢'I went for a visit and to buy meat from a butcher store. When I re
turned my husband 1^ fingers were bleeding, and I asked him the reason.
He pointed to his fingers and said they were cut on the building where he
worked. Every time I went near the door he told me to go away, and then
said we should go to San Francisco to see my little children. When we
grot to the depot he bought tickets and lost one, so I bought a ticket to
Barstow. There was no other man in the house but my husband."
That the murder of Lee Gar was premeditated there is little doubt.
The woman, Trinidad Figueroa, went to the laundry Saturday afternoon
and recuested that Lee Gar be sent to the house Sunday afternoon for
some washing. The murderers knew that he did the collecting. They also
knew that it was shortly after payday on the Santa Fe and that he would
have a large sum of money with him.

The "Left-IIanded."
â¢ One of the gravest objections to
training a child to be left-handed (as
recommended In this month's Paldolo
gist) is the certainty, that it will be
nicknamed from its peculiarity, es
pecially during the early years of its
life.' Most counties in this country
have " their idiomatic expressions to
denote left-handedness and- they are
often' prefixed to the unfortunate left
handed child's name.- In London the
term is kack-handed, the word being
also equivalent to awkward ; in Lan
cashire it is k-pawed ; in Yorkshire,
gallock-.or gawk-handed, an expres
sion dating back to at least the seven
teenth century. In Derbyshire are
used the terms keg-harided, cork
handed; while in Teesdale district
cuddy-handed is common; and in Not
tingham, wallet-handed. In the south
of England special terms to donate
left-handedness are also found. In
Dorset it is scrane-handed. In Scot
land we find gawk-handed and in the
west cawry-handed.' In Ireland a left
handed man is called' a kithogue. Not
many years ago Tim Healy used this
word in a speech in East Wicklow, in
which he said that Mr.-O'Kelly could
fight with his left . hand and had al
ready given his opponent some "kith
ogues" tl}at I would spoil his political

The general public, we fear, is not
acquainted with, the dangers arising
from arsenic coloring matter in wall
paper. A reccÂ«t death in Palmer.
Mass., is dlrecQy attributed, by the
medical authorities, to this cause. The
trouble which resulted so disastrously
made its appearance a year and a half
ago in what seemed to be nervous dys
pepsia. Two months of travel abroad
seemed to greatly improve the patient,
but on returning home he soon grew
worse agaln^ On account of certain
conflicting symptoms which could not
be readily accounted for, a specialist
was called ajnd gave it as his opinion
that there was arsenic poisoning in the
system. An investigation was then
made which, resulted in the discovery
of arsenic colors In the wall paper of
the fitting room. This room had been
papered shortly previous to the appear
ance of the* first symptoms. The wall
paper was. at one*' removed, but the
disease had by this time progressed so
far that it was impossible to save tha

CHICAGO, Dec. 24. â By dissolving
the incorporated organization known
as Frank}in Union No. 2, the striking
press feeders here .stole a march to
day on the Chicago Typathetae, the
association of. eipployers. The press
feeders, being incorporated, were lia
ble to-.be sued by law.
Judge Holdom recently fined the
union $1500, and damage suits are now
pending for many times this amount
on account of the strike, which is one
of the most persistent ever fought in
Chicago. If the employers could have
secured judgment "against the corpo
ration they might have been able to
seize the $4000 in the union's treasury,
or a goodly part of the sum, under the
Taffvale decision in England, which
holds incorporated unions liable for
stock damage.
As a voluntary association, the press
feeders believe they are Â»safe from
damage suits, except as individuals.

SENATOR CLAY'S ATTITUDE.
Now, a theory formerly held was that
these fireflies stored! up light rn the
daytime for emission at night, as is
done by the sc -.lied luminous paint
of calcium sulphide. But it was found
that they shone as brightly as ever
after being confined for ten days in
darkness. Some that, were carried from
Cuba to Havre in the pitch-black hold
of a vessel were brilliant on their ar
rival.
A more striking disproof, however.
was afforded by a batch of larvae
hatched in the dark from eggs laid in
the dark in a piece of rotten wood, the
young Insects being kept in darkness
for the first six months of their lives.
They shone as brijllantly as any of the
other fireflies.â Philadelphia Record.
Have you ever heard of the cucujo?
If you are one of those unfortunates
who are in the habit of grumbling at
gas bills you will wish that the placo
was swarming with cucujos, so that
the gas companies might be circum
vented. The cucujo is the *.-efly of
the tropics, and it is the most brilliant
of the whole tribe of light-giving in
sects or animals. Thirty-eight of them
yield one candle power.
Photographs have been printed by
two-minute exposui-e of bromide platea
to their Illumination. People In Cuba
confine them in paper lanterns for go
ing about the country at night or for
indoor lighting. Sometimes they at
tach one of the insects to each foot
for traveling in the dark to serve as a
guide to the path; also, they use them
as ornaments for the dress and hair.
Cucujos are beetles beginning life
as grubs. Skipjacks, or springtaiK
they are sometimes called, because
when placed on their backs they jump
over with a clicking sound. â¢

SALT LAKE. Utah, Dec. 24.â Louis
Robert!, organizer for the United Mine
Workers of America, came here to
night after a strenuous experience in
Carbon County, where a strike is on
against tne Utah Fuel Company. On
Tuesday last Roberti held a meeting
at Scofield, and later boarded the train
for Colton. Armed '' employes of the
coal company arrested him on an al
leged warrant charging . vagrancy,
marched him up the railroad track to:
winter quarters, three miles away, and
held a hearing in the company's office
before a Justice of the Peace" who is
a bookkeeper for the company. The
"Justice" discharged the prisoner, after
extracting $6 from him. He was then
turned over to the company employes,
who, armed with rifles, forced him to
go to a company boarding-house, where
he was kept a prisoner all night under
guard. This 'morning he was put abbard
a train end sternly warned to leave
the county and --ver return. Roberti
will appeal to the Governor for pro
tection in an effort to 'return to the
scene of the strike.
This was one of several instances of
a similar character. Demolli. the. Ital
ian organizer for the mine workers,
was twice arrested and railroaded out
of Carbon County, it being made so
unpleasant for him that he was finally
forced to leave the State, his work be
ing tal-?n up by Roberti.
The strikers are pitching tents and
preparing ior a long siege. _ The com
pany is operating the mines at a re
duced output with non-union recruits
largely obtained with the help of the
Mormon church.
Roberti, with Attorneys Edler and
Fowler, representing the striking coal
miners, have arranged for an audience
with Governor Wells to be held on
Saturday. They will protest against
what they term the farcical administra
tion of Justice In Carbon County.
Roberti calls his treatment by the

"kidnaping" and declares that he will
bring both criminal and civil proceed

WASHINGTON, Dec. 24.â General
Reyes, special representative of Co
lombia to the United States, to-day
presented to. Secretary Hay. at ...his
house the protest he has been preparing
against the action of the United States
in recognizing the republic of Panama.
Later General Reyes said that he ex-,
pected to remain in "Washington until
he received an answer from Secretary
Hay to the note submitted to-day. This
paper, he expects, will be sent to Con
gress soon after that body convenes in
January. General Reyes said he dep
recated warlike talk and endeavored
steadily to" prevent any outbreak on the
part of the people of Colombia against
the United, States.
General Reyes sent an urgent cable
gram to President Marroquin to-day,
the first two words of which were,
"Be patient." He sends a cable to the
same effect every day, in the hope of
quieting his people, at least until his
mission here is completed.
Acting Secretary of State Loomis
received a cablegram from Snyder,
the United States Charge at Bogota,
stating that he had assumed charge
of the United States legation and that
Minister Beaupre was leaving for
home to-day.
To-day, for the first. time in, a week,
hearses carried the dead -*to? the ceme
teries In and around 'Chicago., The
hearses were vdriven by -non-union
drivers, the livery owners abandoning
the policy of pleading danger and with
holding service. Although the police
were ordered to attend funerals if
necessary, arid non-union drivers went
armed in expectation of opposition from
union pickets who besieged the under
takers* establishments, no disorder oc
curred.
The services of a union striker who
offered' to drive the- hearse at the
funeral of Detective Thomas D. Fa-rns
worth were rejected because he:refused
to take off his union button. .. Police,
both in uniform and plain clothes;
guarded the hearse. Two detectives .ac
companied the empty hearse from the
stable. Six patrolmen in uniform acted
as pallbearers.
With uniformed policemen "mounted
on the hearse and in carriages the body
of William Hartmann was taken to
Oakwood Cemetery. The strikers had
pickets in the neighborhood " of the
home, but they announced their pres-Â«
ence was merely for the purpose of see*
ing that no unldn men were driving the
carriages." ' ' *â¢''* â¢ Â¦ * . *" : . â¢ .' > !

each of these men he demanded $50,000
in his first-letters and on receiving no
replies, it is said, reduced the amount
demanded to $25,000. Among those in
Chicago on whom Brennan attempted
to levy tribute were Marshall Field, R.

CHICAGO, Dec. 24. â The source of
mysterious letters demanding large
sums of money, which for the last six
months have been received by men
high in the financial world of New
York and Chicago was to-day traced
to' Lieo R. Brennan. a commercial art
ist of Chicago. Brennan was arrested
as he was leaving the general post
offlce, where he had gone in answer to
a decoy letter. When confronted with
this evidence Brennan confessed to
having attempted to enforce a dozen
demands tot sums of from $25,000 to
$50,000 and having threatened his in
tended victims with death should they
refuse to pay. In his confession Bren
nan declared that all his attempts to
extort money had been futile, as he
had never received a dollar in answer
to the demands.

LONDON, Dee. 24.â Diplomatic circles
In London look for several dv.ys of dull
Russo-Japanese negotiations. Â¦ Japan's
â¢ counter-proposals possibly will entail
somewhat prolonged consideration.
Meanwhile, a London Times dispatch
from Tokio says: *â¢
"The best informed circles In Japan
do not share the pessimism which ap
pears to prevail in London, inasmuch
as the resources of diplomacy are by no
means exhausted."
Embassador Choate, who ytsterday
attended Lord Lansdowne'B reception
at the Foreign Office, is among those
who can hardly conceive that some way
out of the difficulty cannot be found,
in order to avoid a war which "must
be disastrous to both nations and the
consequences of which upon other na
tions cannot be foreseen."
The reported 'naval and military
preparations on the part of Russia and
Japan are regarded here as ordinary
precautions which would inevitably, be
taken by the disputants in such a case,
and which have but slight bearing on
the eventual issue of the negotiations.
On the supposition that Great Brit
ain, a3 a last resort, might threaten to
forcibly interfere, the United States
London Diplomatic Circles Expect
Prolonged Negotiations.

ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 24.â The
Russian newspapers are displaying
the liveliest Irritation at the British
press, whose anti-Russian attitude in
the present Russo-Japanese dispute
has aroused even greater, public ani
mosity'against Great Britain than ex
isted against Japan. The Japanese
Minister, M. Kurlno. has been Indis
posed as a result of a chill for some
days, and has had no interview with
Foreign Minister Lamsdorff. Xeither
the members of the Japanese legation
nor the other Japanese residents here
are Ehowirijg any sign3 of impending
departure.. .
The hopefulness in official circles
of a pacific settlement of the Russo-
Japanese dispute was reflected v to
day on the Bourse, which largely.re
covered from the nervousness which
has prevailed for several days.

"This is met by Judge Baldwin with
an absolute specific and categorical de

any w ay connected with or that h*
Ji^d ar.y knowledge of any agreement
to rz.' any moneys to Dr'grg.-'. or that
h> knew ai all of thÂ» employment of
Drirsrs in any way by the company.
"It appears to me. therefore, that
Judge Baldwin has sufficiently met the
charges cf Improper or corrupt connec
tion with the sale of Brandt auto
matic cashiers to the PostofTieo Depart
ment and that he should be deemed
exonerated from any complicity in any
fraud or corruption which may have
existed in that business.''
"The allegation that Judge Baldwin
'appeared to have been willing to adopt
any measures that would bring about
*n order, whether such measures were
legitimate influence or illegitimate use
of money,' appears to be baseti only on
a statement of Miller in a letter of
April S, IS29. in which he said:
" "Juclsf Baldwin also says to find

Beavers wants to insure vnr success

this move.*
"WASHINGTON. Dec. 21.â JudÂ£?
Bald "in. L'nited States Consul at Nu

Pierce cf any connection with the plac
ing of â¢'Brandt-Dent cashiers' in the
Postoffice Department, as related in the
report Â«'f Conrad and Bonaparte in_
their investigation of irregularities in
the- Postoffice Department.
In response to a request from Secre
tary Pierce. Judjre Baldwin submitted
a full statement of his connection with
the aflfa.!'- under investigation. Refer
ring to this in his? report. Pierce says:
"Judpc Baldwin seems to have satis
factorily met all the points covering:
any improper action on his part with
the purchase by the Postofflce Depart
ment of th* 3 Brandt automatic cashiers.
He says thai, in his capacity as a law
yer, and holding no Government posi
tion, he interested himself in the busi
ress of his son-in-law, who was a local
agent of the Bmndt-Dcnt Company, to
the extent of talking v.ith Perry S.
Heath and requesting Mr. Heath- to
look :nto the matter of the Brandt au
tomatic cashier, and if he was satisfied
that the postmasters were desirous of
purchasing the machines and that the
machine was a meritorious and useful
device, at least to accept and pay for the
machines a'.ready in use and to pur
chase such others as theft might be
y^gitimate demand for."
Jud?" Baldwin says that his name
v.'as used "without the slightest war
rent" after this one effort, although he
had nothing more to do with the
cashiers. Pierce concludes:
Guthrie asked a number of questions
designed to bring out Rose's experi
ences in examining shipbuilding and
steel companies, and then cross-exam
ined him as 10 the method in which
the investigation of the Bethlehem
pjant was made.
"If anything in your testimony this
morning seemed to be an aspersion
upon the honor and integrity of the of
ficers of the Bethlehem plant, may I
ask. Mr. Rose, if it was your intention
that such an inference or charge should

"Assuredly not. That was not my in

should bfi drawn I should be sorry," re
plied the witness.

wholesale lines, aa usual at this period,
with fair reorders from jobbers and ex

are the salient features of the week.
Other points brought out are the sus

a drawback with which the cotton man.

correspondent of the Daily Telegraph
says that the Japanese railways have
been ordered to be prepared to trans
port 70,000 troops from the north to
the south. The correspondent says that
there are now forty warships in the
southern waters of Japan, the majority
being fully coaled and ready for any

The Times Shanghai correspondent
says he learns on trustworthy author

on the policy and administration of
the American and the Belgian interests
in the Hankow and Canton Railway
these interests will be separated and
the railway divided into two sections,
the Belgians to control the northern
section, and the Americans the south
ern section. The details of the nego

closed, and it is not known whether
the Chinese Government will acquiesce
in such an arrangement, which is op

Ctoe3us. the John D. Rockefeller

j about 2500 years old. He had his trou-

: Many of the rich man's troubles to-

be avoided. They are brought on by
eating all kinds of rich, heavy foods
at irregular times, lack of proper ex-

stimulants, etc., and are commonly
known as indigestion, dyspepsia and
weak stomach. They are serious trou-

be avoided, but can also be cured, and
that without loss of time or proper food
and nourishment.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the

A great nation has placed its stamp of
approval upon their noble work. The

have effected and the happiness result-

! actually do the work that the weak

and allow It to recuperate and regain
its* strength. They contain all the es-

digest the food just as a sound and well

Jealousy and a quarrel over money
are the causes which led to the shoot
ing early this morning of Louis Gratia
no, who was fatally wounded by bullet*
fired from ambush near his home at 4160
Glen avenue. An hour after the report
of the shooting: waÂ« received at police
headquarters Captain ef Police W. J
Petersen had arrested Louis Oreo, the
accused ambuscader, at M. Bertola'a
house. Forty-seventh street and Tele
graph avenue. Gratiano identified
Oreo at the Fabiola Hospital and de
clared that Oreo was the man who had
shot him.
As soon as the police knew of thÂ«
affair Captain Petersen sent Detectivq
Kyte to Fabiola Hospital, where Gra
tiano had been taken. The wounded
man made a dying statement, and
charged Oreo, his former boarder, with
the crime. A few minutes later Peter-.
sen, with Kyte and Policeman George
Ely, were on the trail of Oreo and
quickly traced him to Bertola'a.
Despite the positive identification by)
Gratiano, the arrested man denies thaft
he fired the. shots which probably will
end Gratiano's life. The wounded man's
statement was corroborated by his son,
11 years old, who was with his father
when the shooting occurred, and de
clares he saw Oreo step from behind
a tree and fire two shots, both of which
wounded the elder man.
Gratiano and Oreo are Italian labor
ers. Oreo is unmarried and had been
a boarder at the other's home for sorao
time. Last night there was a quarrel
between the two. Gratiano told his
roomer that he intended to move soon
to a new house and that Oreo would
have to find another boarding place.
According to the prisoner in his state
ment to the police. Mrs. Gratiano was
the first to advise him of the proposed
change of residence. He went to the
husband and demanded payment of 54S
he claimed Gratiano had borrowed.
Thereat, claimed Oreo, he was attacked
and stabbed by his landlord several
times in the head. After the alleged
quarrel Oreo declared Gratiano and hi3
son left the house.
Oreo said he also left, but returned
later with his father and got his effect3,
taking them to his father's residence
in Alden. After that he went to Ber
tola's, where he was arrested.
Gratiano and his son went out after
the quarrel to find a policeman, they
claimed. It was while they were cross
ing the corner of Forty-first street and
Broadway that the shooting occurred.
"I did not stab Oreo." said Gratiano
in his dying statement. "He hurt his
head by falling. My son and I saw
Oreo step out from behind a tree and
shoot me twice."
Oreo is 24 years old and the wounded
man is thirteen years older. Dr. Der
rick, who attended Gratiano, found
that one pistol bullet >had severe*} 'the
windpipe and the other had passed
through the right lung.
Friends of Gratiano say he suspected
Oreo was trying to pay attention to
Mrs. Gratiano, and that this was the
reason the boarder had been ordered
to leave the house.

Charles Cramer, a follower of the
races, was arrested at Emeryville this
afternoon by Marshal Lane for bother
ing women in the neighborhood of the
racetrack and he is believed to be
"Jack the Hugger," who has been
frightening the belles of Berkeley by
squeezing their waiBts.
The statement made by Marshal Lane
and Recorder Coburn of Emeryville is
tcf the effect that Cramer has been
identified by Mrs. Rossler of that place
as the man who entered her home yes
terday unannounced and demanded
money of her. She is a sufferer from
paralysis and was unable to move from
her chair. She, however, observed
Cramer closely and identified him to
day as the man who came to her house.
He did not trouble her after finding
out that she was ill.
Lane states that women' along the
road between Emeryville and Oakland
have been making complaints and from
the description given of him he was en
abled' to arrest Cramer. He says
Cramer came here from St. Louis. A
charge of vagrancy was placed against
him to hold him for a while and in
the. meantime the ladies of Berkeley
who have been molested will be inter
viewed with the idea of finding out
whether Cramer is responsible for the
disturbances in the college town.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 24.â Six months for
brutally beating his young wife ami
three months more for failing: to pro
vide for his three little children were
the sentences Imposed on George T.
Sousa by Justice of the Peace F. S.
Cone this afternoon. The defendant
pleaded guilty to the first chargre and
was found gruilty of the second accusa
tion by the court.
Sousa's spouse, who confessed to but
20 years and who said that she was
married when 16, was barely able to
take the stand because of the unmerci
ful beatings administered to her during
the last four weeks by her inhuman
husband. She related how Sousa had
refused to furnish food or clothing for
herself and children and stated that
when she begged a dollar from a kind
neighbor, Mrs. Annie Lawrence, with
which to purchase medicine for her
sick baby, her husband knocked her
down and took the coin from her. She
further testified that Sousa had threat
ened her life and that she had fled
from her home, on Jackson street, clad
only in a night dress, to her father's
residence, on Bay Farm Island, to es
cape punishment by Sousa. According
to his wife's testimony, Sousa had pro
vided her and their three children with
one head of cabbage in four weeks, and
that was the extent of his generosity.
Sousa did not deny thrashing his wife
repeatedly, but asserted that he did so
because she made bread that he couM
not bite. When he remarked to Justice
Cone that he wa3 sorry that he had not
beaten his wife more often, the magis
trate remarked: "Well, I will give you
the limit of six months and regret that
I cannot make it longer."

creased from 3,000.000 to upward of
4.000,000 tons. quantitatively the
greatest increase ever made in any
five-year period in the history of this
industry. Moreover, for the first time
in a half a century the ratio o* in
crease in the world's production of
cane sugar has exceeded that of
sugar made from beets, the per
centage of increase in the former
product for the five years being about
double that of the latter. The four
years from 1900-01 to 1903-04. inclu
sive, were each in its turn record
breaking years for the production of
cane sugar. The previous high-record
crop (3.530,000 tons) was that of
1894-95. the crop made just before the
outbreak of the revolution in the most
important producer â Cuba.
"The high record crop in the his

Adopting the tactics often resorted to
by the late C. P. Huntington when he
found a competitor encroaching on his
territory. Harriman, on November 11
bust, had incorporated in this city the
Chico and Northern Railroad, which
announced as its main purpose the
construction Â«>f a road from a point
three miles below Chico to Sterling, the
present eastern terminus of the match
company's road, and a station which
the latter created for its own business
purposes. Harriman's new company
included among its directors I. W. Hell
man Jr.. J- M. Israel, H. M. Holbrook,
C \ Hart and John C. Kirkpatrick.
This board organized with Kfrkpatrick
*s its president, and that was the last
h<!ard of the corporation until the
tranFaction of yesterday.
Realizing that its interests were jeop
ardized, the officials of the Diamond
Match Company were finally forced to
>*urrender to the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and with this purpose in view
the president and directors of the
smaller road made a second trip West
a few weeks ago. and after a confer
ence with General Manager Krutt
schnitt and Chief Counsel Herrin of the
Southern Pacific completed arrange
ments for the transfer. Instead of tak

organised company, the Chico and

MATCH PKOPLE . SURRENDER.
}IAKES BLUET' WORK.
Several weeks later it was learned
that the Southern Pacific surveyors
were at work in the neighborhood of
tho Diamond Match Company's road.
Inasmuch as the Goulds are heavy
stockholders in the match company, it
was hinted that Harriman was afraid
that the line between Chico and Ster
ling might be the nucleus of a Gould
pyptem extension to the coast, and it is
t-aid that this fear was stimulated by
the fact that it was known that the
match company had a party of Eur
vry<? rs mapping out a route to the
oastward, by way of the Big Meadows,
t* Inch is regarded as one of the most
feasible outlets for a railroad from the
coast to the East.
Another California railroad has been
added to the long list of properties con
trolled by E. H. Harriman. At a meet
ing held yesterday at the Palace Hotel
the Diamond Match Company's road
between Chico and Sterling, known as
the Butte County Railroad, passed into
the ownership of the Chico and North
ern Railroad, a corporation whose stock
is controlled by Harriman. Immediate
ly after the deal was effected the Chico
and Northern leased the road to the
Diamond Match Company, which is at
present using It as a medium for reach
ing its vast timber tracts in Butte
County.
Harriman has been negotiating for
the road for some time, a fact which
became known several months ago to
a number of local people, but it was
otnpha.tica.lly denied by the represen
tatives of the Southern Pacific Com
pany ia this city. It has developed
that the first move to acquire the road
Â¦was made nearly a year ago. about the
time that the officials of the Diamond
Match Company came West to inspect
the concern's properties in that sec
tion of ?Â«Â«Â«â¢ State. The latter then made
an attempt to enter into a traffic alli
ance with the Southern Pacific Com
pany with a view tcrward handling
oast-bound traffic and an engagement
had previously been made with Harri
man, who was then here, to talk over
the subject. On the day of the ap
pointment, however, the Southern Pa
cific magnate suddenly departed for
the East, without giving the slightest
intimation of his going to the repre
sentatives of the match company, who
were at Chico.
IIARRIMAXS CUXXIXG MOVE.
Arriving here, they openly expressed
their indignation over the manner in
which they had been treated, claiming
that one of the purposes of their visit
to San Francisco was to confer with
Harriman on this subject and that the
appointment had been made'at his sug
gestion.

of Joseph and Louis Choisser, father
and son, of Equality, 111., who were
shot and killed by detectives in this
city a week ago while resisting arrest,
are taking steps to have the matter
reopened and an investigation had
which will go behind the findings of the

witnesses have come forward whose
statements contradict in every detail
the testimony of the detectives. The
District Attorney's office is making a
thorough investigation.

German Army Decadence.
Considerable sensation has been
made in < Paris by the appearance in
the Gil Bias of an .article entitled
"The Greatness and Decadence of the
German Army." The author ia evi
dently very familiar with the . condi
tions' in that service. The' points he
makes are that- the general discon
tent and spirit of revolt "in labor
circles is extending to the army, be
ing, taken there by the youths from
the towns and cities. By them it is
communicated to the youth, from the
country, who, at the end of their ser
vice, take it home with them. The
immediate results are seen, in the in
creasing unwillingness of the youth o*f
the country to join the colors, for they
know beforehand. th'e severe treatment
they are likely to receive. The author,
-says, also, that the average , German ,
officer Is not only- lacking in enthu
siasm In â¢ his duties, . but . is actually
cold toward them, accepting, them aj I

Sir Knights and their friends, who will
fill San Francisco next September. Al
most from the very hour it was learned
that the Grand Encampment of the
United States, then in session at Louis
ville. Ky., had voted to hold its twenty
ninth triennial conclave in San Fran
cisco, California Commandery set to
work with zeal and enthusiasm to plan
for the most cordial and brilliant recep
tion and entertainment in the history
of Templarism. â¢
The commandery speedily appointed
a committee composed of its most ac
tive and energetic members, whose ex
perience in that line admirably fitted
them for efficient service. Plans were
outlined for a round of entertainments
and festivities during conclave week
destined to eclipse the most lavish Hos
pitality extended to the Californians at
former conclaves. In' time the original
plans were enlarged upon, the commit
tee-augmented and strengthened, va
cancies filled, sub-committees appoint
ed and every detail fully attended to.
The following constitute the executive
committee: Sir Knight P. F. Ferguson,

reception during conclave week, and
the large pavilion will probably form

itors. To provide funds to defray the

Of the corps that have entered for
competition there are two rrom Louis
ville, Ky.. and one each from Milwau
kee, Chicago, Denver, Columbus, Pitts
hurg. Tunkhannock and Detroit. For
the California competition there are
fourâ California Cojnmandery No. ,1,
Golden Gate Commandery, Oakland
and Los Angeles.
It Is proposed to classify the competing corps,
with magnificent prizes for each class, as fol
lows: First class,*' drill corps attending, and
competing, coming from oatt of . tfje . Rocky
Mountains; second clasn, drill corps attending
and competing." coming from west of the Rocky
Mountains; third class, the corps of San Fran
cisco commanderies, California No. 1 and Golden
Gate No. 16. The competitive drill between
the two latter -corps will not be identified nor
havp any connection with the preceding drills
in which th* corps from abroad will participate.
They will not compete for any of the honors,
nor for any of the prizes offered to awaken
the interest and arouse the enthusiasm of visit
ing drill corps; the prize for which these two
corjie will contend will be special and distinct
from bM other prizes. -
It Is eminently desirable that each command
ery from the United States and Canada attend
ing the twenty-ninth Triennial Conclave be rep
resented, by its corps in this friendly contest
It is propowd to make the drill feature of the
conclave one of exceeding brilliancy and "to
this end It is hoped that the drill corps of your
fomman'Ury will, upon receipt of this commu
nicationâIf they have not already done soâ at
once begin active preparations to participate In
the competition.
The Interest in the twenty-ninth Triennial
Conclave or the Grand Encampment of the
United States, which is to be held in San Fran
cisco, the metropolis of the Pacific Coast, In
1SÂ»O4 is intensifying throughout the country.
The ' comwandpriee of this State, under the
guiding hand of the Grand Commandery of thii
juris<iictlon, are preparing to extend a royal
welcome to their fraters and friends from
abroad and to greet them with a hospitality
that will tend to make the coming Triennial
Conclave pre-eminently the most famous con
clave ever -recorded in the annals of .Templar
encampment*. Numbered in the brilliant pro
gramme of events already scheduled Is a series
of competitive drills, for which elaborate plans
are b^ir.g formulated. Prizes well calculated
to excite the emulation and ambition of com
peting eommanderies. the finest creations of the
Jeweler's art. will be offered as an Inspiration
for excellence in drill. The rules governing the
competitive drills will be in accordance with
the tactics of the Grand Comandery of Cali
fornia, by the Kight Eminent Sir Frank W.
Sumner. One copy of these tactics will be
mailed to the commandant cf each drill corps
regularly entered for this contest. All entries
mufct be nyide under the peal and by the
proper effloer* of the commandery. The drill
is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday of
the triennial week". The distribution of prizes
wilr- be the feature of Thursday evening. A.
complete schedule of the movements to be exe
cuted will- be in the hands of. the commandant
of each competl ng' corps at least ninety days
before starting for San Francisco.
TO CLASSIFY CORPS.
the order will be offered for excellence
in drills. The committee at Its first
meeting appropriated $15,750 in prizes.
At that time it was expected that .not
more than ten drill corps would enter
the competition. Since then the num
ber of competitors has . reached thir
teen, and one or two more are likely to
enter. The committee contemplates
doubling the original amount set aside
for prizes, in order to offer eufflcient
inducement to the best corps to parti
cipate In the competition.
California won the. first prize at the
Triennial Conclave held three years ago
at Louisville, and the California com
manderies will not enter the general
competition this time, but will compete
for special prizes. Captain Reuben P.
Hurlbut, chairman of the competitive
drill committee, has sent the following
letter to all commanderies:

The committee is negotiating for
VAST THRONG EXPECTED.
That Sar. Francisco is Justified In
expecting the largest attendance in its
history may be inferred from the re
port made by the hotel committee
through its chairman. W. Z.. Growall,
who has been in correspondence with
commanderies throughout the country
for the last year ana a half. Basing
his estimates upon reliable information,
he predicts that 50,000 visitors will come
from east of the Rockies and fully as
many more from the Pacific Coast
States and Territories. Â¦ More than 6000
Sir Knights had secured accommoda
tion for the conclave up to last Sep
tember, just one year '.n advance of
the event, and vhey were booked ex
actly as they desired, in the very best
hotels. Late applicants had to take
second choice, themeh there is ample
room for all that may come. â¢ Out of
the thirty-nine Grand Commanderies
that are coming thirty-two have se
cured headcuarters at the Palace. Of
the subordinate commanderies 125 have
secured accommodations and headquar
ters .at hotels and boarding-houses in
all parts of the city and most of those
will entertain at their quarters. It is
row estimated that tTi.000 Sir Knights
will parade and that they will be cheer
ed by 250,001 enthusiastic spectators.
Most of the Sir Knights write that
they will bring theJr wives and mem
bers of their families.
Tradesmen still speak of the former
conclave and recall visions of the
etreak of gold left in the path of the
visitors. They will welcome them
again, more heartily than ever, as will
the whole population. To insure the
greatest success and to eclipse all for
mer events for which Sari Francisco
has earned the most enviable reputa
tion as a convention city, the Grand
Commandery of California and the
subordinate commanderies, with their
committees, have been attending to
the preliminaries for almost two years
and have been laying up a fund for the
most lavish entertainment and recep
tion possible. The Grand Commandery
of California has thus far put aside
5 36,000 and expects to increase the
amount to nearly $60,000 by next Sep
tember. California Commandery will
have a fund of about $40,000, while
Golden Gate Commandery expects to
have about $25,000. The commande
ries from Oakland, Sacramento, San
Jose and all the larger cities in Cali
fornia will probably contribute to the
entertainment fund from $5000 to
51^,000 each, which will swell the
total to a much larger amount than
has ever been expended in entertain
ing any body of visitors. All this vast
sum of money comes from tjie frater
nity and is to be expended in enter
taining.
The Mechanics' Pavilion has been se
cured for the main gathering place and
continuous entertaining, aside from
Â¦what the Grand Commandery and the
subordinate bodies will do at their sep
arate headquarters. It will be. one
round of festivities from the time the
Templars step on San Francisco soil
until they leave. The expense of the
Illumination, which Is to surpass in
dazzling brilliancy even that which has
made San Francisco famous in recent
years, the street decorations and many
other attractions demanding large ex
penditure will be defrayed through dif
ferent sources.
Many San Franciscans have a vivid
recollection of the Templar conclave
held here in 1SS3, nor have they for
gotten the magnificent display by the
cream of American manhood parading
the streets of the city, cheered by
many thousands, residents and visitors,
the greatest spectacle ever witnessed
on the Pacific slope.
REMEMBER LAST CONCLAVE.
The Triennial Conclave of the
Knights Templar, which is to be held
s .n San Francisco next September, is
destined to become memorable in the
history of California as the greatest
and most notable event that has ever
tp.ken place In the State, as well as in
the annals of Templarism.
'All roads lead to California in
]904"' is the motto of all sir knights
east of the Rockies, and it gains in
volume and strength as the months
pass. "All roads lead to San Francis
co next September" resounds the echo
throughout the Pacific Coast. Thou
panCs of persons have been looking
toward that great event and preparing
for the visit to the metropolis by the
Golden Gate for almost three years,
and San Francisco will probably house
at that time a larger number of Btran
gers than ever before, not excepting
the period of the recent Grand Army
Encampment.
i No greater actlyltjr, 1 n6 more genuine';'
enthusiasm can be Imagined than.per

already grown to about $20,000, with
every- indication of reaching double
that sum before next September, and
California Commandery- is assured of
being, supplied with all the means
necessary to carry out the stupendous
plan for its entertainment.
WOMEN WILL CO-OPERATE.
The conclave committee will soon ap
point an auxiliary, composed of a num
ber of representative women, who will
co-operate with the commandery in en
tertaining their guests, especially the
ladies who will accompany the Sir
Knights from abroad. Plans for these
entertainments that shall most delight
the. visitors have been suggested,
though their adoption shall have to
bide the pleasure of the auxiliary. If
carried out, ..they will become a* fea
ture of the conclave and enhance Cali
fornia's fame for hospitality. The em
blematic souvenir badge the. command
ery will procure for the occasion Is to

KNIGHTS TEMPLAR WHO
HAVE CHARGE OF CON
CLAVE ARRANGEMENTS.
The Pullman Company is .. overhaul
ing its sleeping coaches, turning out
new ones at a 'marvelous rate, both
first-class and second-class, and get
ting them Into shape to accommodate
the Sir Knights and their friends who
will* accompany them on the westward
Journey. The following sleeping-car
rates have been established for that
occasion : From Chicago and common
points, first-class, $14; tourist cars, ?7.
Missouri Riyer and common polnta,
first-class, $11,60; tourist, $6.
.': In addition to the most excellent
sleepin-car service all lines will be
prepared to furnish, all trains will be
equipped with modern reclining chair
cars and coaches for the "free use of
every possible comfort and rapid trans
portation; to avoid delays and acci
dents, and adopted rates equal ,tÂ« the
lowest known in transcontinental
travel. These rates cover the fare from
all principal points from Chicago and
west to San Francisco. and Los Angeles
and return. From Chicago and return
the fare is $50 for the round trip, 2o00
miles each way with every comfort.
From points along the Mississippi
River the round trip rate is $47 50;vfrom
Missouri River points, $45; from Colo
rado common points, $40; from Albu
querque, El Paso and points along that
line, $35; from Salt Lake City. $36 50.
The tickets will be on sale not later
than August 15, with a final limit of
sixty days from the date of purchase.
These tickets are good for passage -jver
the Central and Southern routes, com
ing and going either way at the same
rate. Coming or returning via Port
land, Oregon, will cost an additional
$11.
All the transportation companies in
terested in this westward hegira are
making ample preparations to handle
the vast hosts that are sure .to throng
trains and depots.
PULLMAN COMPANY READY.
All local and coastwise transporta
ticn companies are 'making exceptional
efforts to accommodate the traffic, both
by rail and steamship, to all points of
interest in California and the Pacific
Coast, and also to carry the many
thousands of dwellers from Pacific
Coast States and Territories to San
Francisco during conclave week.
All transportation companies and
passenger agents predict that the com
ing conclave will be a record breaker in
transcontinental as well as in coast
travel, " and ' they will be prepared to
meet the demand.
The Pullman Company has at its dis
posal and ready for Immediate use
about 3500 standard first-class sleepers
and 500 tourist sleeping cars, each cap
able of comfortably accommodating
from forty to forty-five passengers, or
a total of from 160,000 to 180,000.
; The 'rates are made effective at a
date that will permit the movement of
this vast body gradually and without
taxing the various lines centering at
San Francisco. Many Sir Knights and
their families will start from their
homes three weeks prior to the opening
of the conclave. Many commanderiea
will . travel by special trains, stopping
at numerous points of interest, such
as Yellowstone Park, the Cascades, in
the Pacific Northwest at grand old
Shasta and the Siskiyou Mountains, the
Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Manitou
Springs, the- Royal Gorge, Leadville,
Salt Lake City, the capital of Mormon
dom; the Great Salt Lake, then over
the Sierra Nevada? the Grand Canyon
of Arizona, the most wonderful giant
chasm ever discovered; El Paso, Tex.;
Juarez, Mexico; the wonderful mining
camps of Arizona.", the orange groves of
Southern California, Yosemlte Valley
and Calaveras Big Trees.
Many of the visitors will take In the
greater portion of these wonderful
sights on their way to the conclave,
which will spread the heavy travel over
a much longer period and give the
railroads the best opportunity to handle
all the traffic comfortably.

MUMMIES FOUND IN CAVE
ON ISLAND OFF ALASKA
Partly Petrified Remains of Two In
dian Men and a Woman Discover
ed Near Prince Edward Sound.
There are three mummies on ex
hibition at the Baldwin Annex saloon.
The partly petrified semblances of the
human form were sent to James Orn
dorff from a friend, who found them
in a cave on one of the islands of
Prince Edward Sound, Alaska. In
the cave with the mummies was found
a petrified tree of a dwarf variety.
This is also exhibited with the other
relics.
The three figures are in sitting pos
tures, the knees being doubled up un
der the chin. All of them are clad
in fine sea otter skins, which with
stood the ravages of time excellently.
One of the mummies is the remains
of a woman. The cave in which they
were found is about twenty feet
from the sea beach. â¢ The relics are
supposed to be the remains of num
bers of an old race of Indians that
formerly inhabited the island. Sev
eral stone axes and other crude im
plements used by prehistoric races
were found in the cave with the
bodies.
Just how old the preserved gentle
men and lady are is not known, but
they are supposed to have made their
debut into the other world innumer
able moons ago. They will be sent
to the St. Louis fair as a part of the
San Francisco exhibit.

THE Visalia Times congratulates the people of Tu

lace in the Superior Court tending to .'cut down the
jury expenses of the county. "Persons who are exempt
from jury duty," remarks the Times, "if they intend to
claim exemption, which is a personal privilege, and
which they may waive, should not be permitted to at
tend court and earn jurors', fees and then claim exemp
tion when the law permits them'to prove their right to
exemption by filling proper affidavits before the day on
which they are summoned to appear. . Under the new
rule of the court, where they have notice of it, they will
be deemed to have .waived their right to exemption
where they do not claim it before the day they are sum
moned to appear."
A considerable amount of money would seem to have
been taken, out of the public funds in Tulare County by
jurors in the way indicated by the Times, and the rule

What has become of the diamonds of
India? The question is put by the
County Gentleman, who recalls that
nearly all the historical diamonds of
the world came from the Peninsula.
One of the most famous has a history
dating from A. D. 1304, when it was
the property of . th.e Rajah of Malwa.
The "Great Mogul" diamond was found
in the Koller mine, on the Kistna, In
1650. The "OrloTf" diamond was Indian,
though it was purchased in Amster
dam in 1776. It was originally the eye
of an idol in Mysore. The "Regent"
diamond, one of the French national
jewels, came from a Kistna inine. The
last fine diamond found, or acknowl
edged as found, in India was one of 67%
tarats, dug up at Bellars. Now no
stones of any value are ever recorded
as found. â¢ . . '

O blessed town of Bethlehem,
How happy Is thy state!
How blest above all palaces
The stable at thy gate!
For there In manger-cradle
(Oh true the angel word!)
As King enthroned of all the worlds
Reigns Jesus Christ the Lord.
â From the Outlook.
For on this day is born there
Within your little town
A child who Christ the Lord is
Yet wears no earthly crown:
He brmgeth Joy and gladness
To you and all mankind.
Yea, peace on earth and good-will
To men of equal mind.
What music of the heavens â
What magic song of bliss â
What vision of the night-tide â
What mystic light is this?
The silly sheep are blinded, ,
The shepherds in amaze
Stand awestruck, all the hillside
With glory is ablaze!
The angels' joyous chorus
Rings out into the night.
O Gloria in Excelsls! â¢
Sing praises in the height.
Sing praises, men of Bethlehem, â¢
Sing praises here below.
For peace on earth and right good-will
He doth on you bestow.
Blessed Bethlehem.
(^ blessed town of Bethlehem
Within thy gray-green shade.
Ringed round with terraced vineyard
And depth of olive glade":
There on thy high green pastures
The shepherds watch the sheep.

O'er all the upland steep.
It was on Christmas eve. Those two",
the boy lover and his girl sweetheart,
sat out there on an old eucalyptus log
under the clear Noel moon and the
steady" shining stars talking together.
Sweeping his hand over toward the
long girdle of sparkling lights which
marked where the great city lay across
the bav. the boy looked up inter her
face and was boastful m his speech.
"Two more years of college, my girl,
and then that great city over there,
which I will conquer for you and for
me. That is the place which must
bring happiness for us both, and I will
get it as surely as you love me. I will
be successful, famous maybe. And then
when we are sitting before our own
yule log on some Christmas eve over
yonder in that circle of lights we can
think of the time when we sat out
here on this- log like any two children
and dreamed for the future which was
to be for usâ for us both, my little
girl."
She said nothing, but the bowed head
and the hand reaching out to his was
enough.
\t was upon a Christmas eve again
when theÂ« crowd of men about the
cheery fire in the club were swapping
yarns. "Yes." said one of the fellows,
settling himself down deeper in his
chair with bachelor indolence. "I once
ma' 1 - the rashest promise of my life on
a Christmas eve. I promised a girl to
win this city for herâ and she prom
ised to wait for me." .
Promises.
No person in the New York Central
offices at that time took into consider
ation the possibility of William K.
ever having "the chance." His father,
hale and robust, had not yet relin
quished the rresidency of the road.
There was J. H. P.ntter, vice president,
ready to step into William H. Vander
bilt's official shoes, and, furthermore,
there was "Willie K.'s" elder brother,
Cornelius, physically strong, capable,
sedate and plodding, in direct line of
succession to the headship of the house
of Vanderbilt. The young clerk was
scarcely treated with" the respect that
would ordinarily go to a son- of the
then richest man in the world.' He
made no sign of discontent, however,
but went about his duties day after day
with systematic directness. His amia
bility was often mistaken for lack of
spirit, and high-salaried clerks as
sumed to patronize him and now and
then shifted odd jobs of their own upon
his non-protesting shoulders.
Now William K. Vanderbilt has his
desk â a plain, flat-topped mahogany
table â within a few feet of where he
drudged as a boy. Some of the clerks
who patronized him are still there. The
sound of his voice, the shuffle of his
foot, the scratching of his pen com
mand alert attention and eager obeis
ance. A letter or paper accidentally
pushed over the edge of his desk and
dropping on the floor impels even the
highest salaried clerks to an involun
tary movement to pick it up. But the
present head of the house of Vanderbilt
neither requires nor tolerates such ob
sequious attentions. Quiet, courteous
and amiable as when he was a clerk,
he transacts such business as is at
hand without flurry, without aggres
siveness and without noise. But un
fiinchirig authority is there, and all of
the New York Central employes realize
the fact. ' ' "
Suppose that Mr. Vanderbilt detects
a blunder or remlssness in the perform
ance of an Important duty. He sends
for the responsible officer and quietly
remarks: "Mr. /here is a complaint
affecting your department. Please look
into the matter thoroughly and report
the facts to the president." Mr. Van
derbilt probably forgets this conversa
tion at once, but the inexorable routine
of the New York Central system grinds
out the delinquent's fate. The report
must, under the methods that prevail,
be marked "by Mr. V.'s order," ' and
when the facts are sifted by the presi
dent scant mercy is shown to the man
at fault. Appeals for clemency are met
by the stern rejoinder, "This is a mat
ter that Mr. Vanderbilt took up, and I
can do nothing for you." j
Any expressed wish of W. K. Vander
bilt is law in. the New York Central of
fices.. He exercises an autocratic sway
over all of the railroads in the Vander
bilt system. Presidents of the different
lines are simply his unquestioning lieu
tenants, and boards of directors exe
cute his plans with scarcely a com
ment. rfSgjgS
William K. Vanderbilt, the elder, has
been a good worker as well as a good
idler. When he was a boy his grand
father, the commodore, expressed fear
that he would be spoiled by too much
petting and idleness. The sturdy com
modore believed that boys should begin
to support themselves just as soon as
possible. William K. remained in tht
academy at Geneva, Switzerland, until
he was about IS years old, when he was
called home and set at work in the of
fice of the treasurer of the New York
Central. The young man was not
averse to this arrangement and he
never whimpered when his father told
Treasurer Rossiter to "pile plenty of
work on this boy and don't let him feel
that he is any different from any other
clerk."
Noting tha fact, recently announced,
that young W. K. Vanderbilt Jr. had
been assigned a desk in the financial
department cf the New. York Central
Railroad with the object of teaching
him something about the railroad busi
ness, a veteran officer of the Central
said: "Well, if this young man is like
his father he will turn out some good
work before he is through."

"CHANCERY AND HIP THROW."
THE characteristic American "hurry up" works out
in the number of lives lost and of people wounded
in the operation of our railways.- For these, grade
crossings bear a large part of the responsibility, and the
rest is charged off to the carelessness caused by railway
operators becoming so accustomed to risk and danger
that they get off guard.,
The relative number of accidents to travelers is not
so much out of proportion to those on European rail
ways as appears by the statistics, "Because our Ameri
can roads carry more passengers per train mile. We
lately had something to say about the impolicy of sacri
ficing safety to speed on the bay ferries from San Fran
cisco. But those who travel do not always think of the
risk, and unless some one thinks for them no thought is
given to the subject. The American rush demands
speed, and rivals in transportation cater to that demand.
It is true that a certain class of railway accidents are not
increased by speed. Given a clear and perfect track and
sound machinery, and a train is as safe at sixty as at
thirty miles per hour. But no eye can see the inside of a
steel rail, nor detect a flaw in the most perfectly an
nealed v wheel. and when a' rail breaks or a wheel col
lapses the destruction is far greater on a high than on
a low speed train.
The report of . the Secretary for Internal Affairs of
Pennsylvania shows' the deaths in that State for the year
on steam and street to be 227, and the non
fatal accidents to be 3050. On the steam roads of the
State 41 passengers were killed, and 1727 were injured.
When the number of passengers hauled one mile on the
steam roads- is taken into account, the number of deaths
is, a low percentage of the total.
It is quite remarkable that the street railways killed 2t
employes and iS^ other persons, including passengers
and those run over on the street. It will cause general
surprise and some apprehension, that the street railroads
kill more people than the steam roads. 1
The steam roads of the country are improving their
accident record since air brakes and safety couplings
were/applied to freight trains. This greatly reduces the
coupling accidents, and the air brakes are found to re
duce collisions by putting- the whole train under quicker
control of the. engineer. Westinghouse is probably the
greatest benefactor of railway travel in the world. His
air brakes not only put trains in the control of the en
gineer, but each car, by. its individual air apparatus, is
controllable by the conductor, the brakeman or the pas
sengers. If this individual air brake had been known and
used the awful accident at Tehachapi, in 1883, could
not have happened. It is especially on our mountain
lines that the air brake adds to safety of operation, for
which all travelers on this coast should be thankful.
One further safety appliance more is in sight, that will
probably soon be made legally" compulsory on all pas
senger trains. The old oil lamps were sure to fire a
train that was derailed, Gas is safer, but not entirely
safe. Electricity is absolutely safe in that, respect. When
a train is derailed the electric lights are cut off by stop
page of the dynamo and breaking of the wires. As law
compelled the use of the safety coupler and air brakes
on freight trains, it can also compel all roads to do what
most of them have done voluntarily, by lighting their
trains with electricity. All 'of the great. American sys
tems have made use of the profits and credit gained by
the prosperity of the last seven years in the physical
improvement of their lines,, reduction of curvature and
doubling .of tracks. All of these make travel safer by
reducing risk, and the corporations could not have made
better use of their profits.

(Athletic Expert Npw York ICvrnlni? World.
Author of ""Muscle Building," etc.)
(Coryrisht. 1903. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
What I said about fighting as long as
you can stand in a street biawl does
not, of course, apply to a casÂ«Â» where
a half-dozen men attack you at once.
Don't be ai-hamed in an event like that
to run for your life. Retreat, against
those odds, is not cowardice. One man
or boy cannot usually (unless he is a
dime novrl hero) put a whoie Â£ang to
fliffht. If a crowd of toughs attacks
you escape as quickly as you possibly
can. If cornered, fight of course, but
take the first chance to get away.
TheÂ«e points are. therefore, for use
when the odds against you are not
hnpelefs.
The stre?t fighter will, as a rule, try
to rush you. His rushes will be clumsy.
If you are not able to keep him on the
defensive by constantly attacking him
take advantage of his clumsiness of
rushing by bringing into use what I
have taught you about side stepping.
Avoid his rush and, before he can re
cover, land a heavy blow on his neck
or jaw. following it up with attack
that will delay his recovery to posi
tion and aggressiveness.
A very few experiences of that sort.
PERHAPS the objection of the very strait Jaced
Puritans of England to Christmas was more be
cause it was a merry Christmas than because it
had significance in theological disputes and matters of
discipline and % doctrine. The day itself, located near the
winter solstice, had its real origin in human nature. The
shortest day of the year had passed, and the world was
getting each day more sunshine and less shadow, and
spring was coming and the w6rld was glad and wanted
to make merry.
" Let- it not be supposed that they, of what we call the
Pagan world, were unaware of the value of utilizing for
the purposes of religion the natural impulses and un
studied purposes o"f the human heart. The students of
the natnreof man, who' were in the world before history
had used a pen, adapted the great physical facts that
commanded the attention of all, for use in the civil and'
religious control of the people/ So "they used solstice
and equinox) and in all of the old .mythologies, Oriental
and Northern, the/e was the -equivalent of our Christ
mas, and fixed at about the same date. ;
Centuries after Christ, and after all trace or possibility
of proving either the place or the date of his nativity
had passed away, this same philosophical study, of the
inherent sentiments of humanity took the use of the
winter solstice from the Pagan world; allied it to the
nativity and preserved its use and purpose. ,By this
transition surely the gladness of the day was added to
rather than detracted from, for Christ, omitting all dog
matic discussion of his divinity, brought into the world
the means of merriment and of gladness .unspeakable, by
opening the door of hope to the race.
He lived in a bad time for gladness, and among a peo
ple who had little cause for. merriment, nor had the
world anywhere much more. It took a long time after
he had gone for the nations to feel the effect of the up
lift, of which he was the impulse. We are often told of*
what he would do if he were on earth now. One has
told us how he would run a newspaper, another how he
would run a store, or a manufactory, or a railroad, and
what he would do if he were Ma'yor- of a city or a mem
ber of its Council. These speculations are all for the pur
pose of condemning the age in which we live, and im
peaching it of wide departure from his precept and ex
ample. â¢ t
One thing is sure, if he were here he -would probably
find it impossible to be a church member, because he
would be surprised that they all depend "upon creeds or
forms or rituals that would be a greater wonder to him
than electricity, railroads and photography. But he
would find springing from all the churches, and firmly
fixed among those who are of no 'church, certain great
ethical principles to which he would be no stranger, for
he taught them. In his time the lack of care for the sick
poor was described accurately. Only a dog was found to
lick the sores of -Lazarus. Now throughout Christen
dom he would find splendid hospitals, equipped with all
the resources of science, in which the poorest, sickest
and most forlorn have help and medicine that were not
within the reach of Caesar himself. All this instead of
the dog licking the sores of Lazarus. .
He emphasized the spirit of religious exclusivcness' in
the priest and the Levite that passed by on the other
side. Now he would find in every, great city hospital re
lief, that pours wine and oil into the wounds of human
ity and binds them up, regardless of their faith. In
London he would find a hospital endowed with millions,
given bv Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, a Parsee millionaire
of Bombay, a fire worshiper, a follower of Zoroaster,
and everywhere creches and hospitals endowed by
Jews for the use of Gentiles and of all people. Lazarus
no longer has to seek, the dogs to lick his sores, and the
haughty spirit of the priest and the exclusiveness of the
Levite are gone out of *the human heart utterly.
So, Jesus looking 'upon these things would* marvel
much and be merry this or any Christmas, that the
world has so much improved in its humanity and quality
of mercy since those hard Judean and Roman days. It
is probable, too, that he would have to be told that this*
vast move upward into a clearer understanding of the
fellowship of man is due entirely to words that he ut
tered and simple duties that he taught to an age that
hardened its ear against him." His aversion to our
churches would be mitigated when he learned that with
all their tiresome disputes about doctrines that he never,
thought of. and rituals and ceremonies which he re
buked in the Jews, still they all have taught!, peace on
earth and good will toward men, and love thy neighbor
as thyself, and out of that has grown hospital, kinder
garten, school, charity and all the splendid expressions
of humanity which emphasize the brotherhood of man.
True, there are slums in our great cities and a sub
merged million, drowning in moral and physical dark
ness. But in his day the world was all slum and the race
paddled and waded in its mire unconscious of anything
better, and so lost that it did not recognize the voice of
the deliverer. These results in this life and in this
world make it a merry Christmas, and not the* profes
sional or prophetic promise of sumptuous scenery, and
music and splendid idleness in a world to come, about
which no man knows anything. It, is a splendid mirage,
inspiring and helpful, but a mirage.
This world, the life of man to-day, the improved graces
of the human heart, the brotherhood of man, are the
great miracles wrought by Jesus, that so far outshine the
ascriptions of superstitution and zeal as to disuse en
tirely the miracles of the synoptics. ' So the Christmas
season, that was before history, has gained in glory by
association with the nativity and has gained in gladness
because it may now celebrate the progress 1 of man under
the ethics of Jesus. %
gomery street, was a silent man. No-
knew whence he came nor what
his name was. Only rarely could he
be seen speeding along the street In
his peculiar jerky gait jjtnd with his
gray whiskers flying back over the
shoulders of his seedy green coat. He
spent -most of the day up in the long
room of a certain old building arranging
and rearranging the countless musty
volumes of an old library which was
stored there. He slept with the books:
a little pallet over near the window
over the poultry market and a rickety
table composed the oasis in this sea
of dingy books.
Upstairs in one of the studios they
were having a Christmas eve jinks.
With dances, frolics with the dummy
figures of the artist and blithe music
from the guitars and the* banjos the
evening was slipping swiftly by, when
some one proposed the health of "Old
Dundreary" in a glass of mulled port.
Instantly It was tossed off, and then
came the Quick suggestion that they
have the silent old recluse up to usher
in the Christmas morn. Two of the
girls and a man tiptoed down the dark
stairs to the door of the old gentle
man's room. There they halted, for
they heard the uncertain notes of a fid
dle coming, muffled with the leaden
weight of that all surrounding sea of
musty books.
With many suppressed giggles, a
stepladder was fetched, from a dark
corner near the janitor's room and the
three eavesdroppers clambered up to
get a peep through the dusty transom.
There sat "Old Dundreary" before the
flickering light of a few coals in the
grate. His brown old fiddle was be
neath his chin and his eyes were closed
as if to catch and hold the memories
of years past. And to the wavering
squeak of the old fiddle he was piping
in his broken tenor: Â«
"While shepherds watched their flocks
by night.
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone around."
"Old Dundreary," as they called him
down around the lower end of Mont-
Memories.
foil other "fouls" dear to the heart of
the street fighter.
The three "holds" I will touch on to
day are the "hip lock," the ."throat and
back lock" and the "chancery and hip
throw."
The "hip lock," briefly, is worked as
follows: When your opponent leads
with his. left, duck' to the side far
enough to avoid his blow; st?p in with
the left till your left hip Is just behind
his left hip. As you step in throw
your left arm about his waist from
in front and catch him under the chin
with your right. Using your left hip
as a lever, press forward ,ond throw
him backward- over your hlj> to the
ground. As you start to bend sharply
abuse. Indeed the says: "Sometimes oearly so
per, cent avoid jury duty by reason of excuses and ex
emptions. Under the new order of court a great ex
pense may be saved the county by those having good
excuses making a showing of their rights to.be excused
before the day they; are summoned to appear. If they
are present in Visalia before the day of trial they may
appear before the court and make their- excuses; if ab
sent they may send affidavits or medical . certificates.
This would entail upon them but a trifling inconvenience
and expense, while the attendance of every juror who is
exempt on the day of trial costs the county on the ave
rage between four and five dollars."
Practices of the sort. mentioned by the Times may
exist in other counties in California. , TÂ» : :sibly the mat
ter is worth looking up. Judge Wallace fias also deter
mined, says the Times, that hereafter jurors will be ex
cused only when, in strict accordance with the rules of
exemption provided by the law, the property of the
juror or property of another intrusted/ to him will be
threatened with material" injury or destruction by rea
son of his detention as a juror, or when his health or
the sickness or death of a member of his family requires
his absence from court. t

The Danish Government has prevÂ»
posed a law empowering all Danish
citizens to change their names- The
reason for this measure is that in Den
mark, as in the Transvaal, there aro
not enough names to go round. In
Copenhagen, it appears, one person in
every ten is called Hansen, and equal
proportions of the inhabitants, are
called Petersen and Sorensen respect
ively. In the rural districts things are
as bad, if not worse. In one commune
of 26,000 inhabitants, for example,
there are only twenty different names,
so that each name is borne on an av-<
erage by 1300 different persons. In
the circumstances one may even doubt
whether a permissive bill can meet
the necessities of the case, and -wheth-.
er it would not be better to send the
Mayor a list of names, with instruc
tions to distribute them impartially

A Curious Excliange.
Only a few years ago we used to
hear vague whispers from the seats
of learning of the gentler sex about
secret athletics and wonderful feats
slyly performed. To-day common
sense ruleSj and our young ladies have
their regular athletic meetings and
play thgir interschool matches at suit
able games very much in the fashion
of their brothers.' Now, what will be
the result of these sweeping changes?
Speaking as an ex-athlete who has en
joyed ample facilities for observing'
the effects of judicious exercise upon
school fellows. I unhesitatingly say
that the exercises and games now so
eagerly followed by women cannot
fall to be productive of great and last
ing good. The benefits of scientific
training 1 of the muscles are well-nigrh
invaluable, the possible . evils so few
as to be unimportant. In these days
the importance of a sound mind and
.a healthy body can hardly be over
estimated, and only a deeply preju
diced person dare say that a vigorous,
healthy outdoor girl is not the queen
of her sex. That we, to-day, have so
many of them is a blessing, the real
worth of which will surely be proved
later on. The outdoor girl of to-day
Is to be the mother of a race, of Btal
warts of the future, so surely as the
race Is to be perpetuated. ,
Woman's place in sport is right be
side her brother. Should she, in some
particular branch of it, move slightly
ahead, or fall a trifle behind, it mat
ters not so long as she keeps In touch.
Then her magical influence will re- !
fine and elevate without detracting
from the value of his favorite pas
times, while she in return will learn
many delightful thing? and find that
priceless reward of outdoor -folkâ^-ro- i
bust health. â Illustrated Sporting

Root has forwarded to the House of
Representatives, through the Treasury
Department, a supplemental estimate
of $2,526,100 for the defenses of the in
sular possessions of the United States.
In his request the Secretary says:
"Defenses for Porto Rico, the Ha
waiian Islands, Guam and the Philip
pines are urgently needed to protect
the newly acquired territory of the
United States and Government prop
erty to be stored there; also to pre
vent interruption of cable communica
tions between San Francisco, the terri
tory of Hawaii and Manila.
"This estimate is submitted with the
object o' beginning the construction
of these defenses at once at such in
sular localities as are now the prop
erty of the United States, or may be
come so before the appropriation is ex
hausted, and of acquiring additional
lands needed as sites for defenses, of
the territory of Hawaii."
An English typewriter company once
made a special machine for Li Hung
Chang. It was necessary to construct
a machine much mere elaborate than
the ordinary instrument, owing to the
strange characters of the Chinese
tongue, and this typewriter was fitted
with 1800 characters, each of which had
to be engraved by hand. Naturally
this wonderful instrument created a
great impression on being introduced
a.l Peking, and it evidently suggested
to the speculative mind of the Chinese
the idea of forming a company for the
sale of Chinese typewriters. One bold
individual went to London with the
project. II<? asserted that it would be
possible to write a kind of Chinese
shorthand with as few as 250 charac
ters (about three times the number
u?ed on the ordinary machine), but
the instrument would be about three
times the usual size, and the price was
to be $5000. In spite of the Chinaman's
conviction that there would be a ready
sale in the Celestial empire, neither the
typewriter firms nor the British capi
talists cared to have anything to do
with so risky a venture. Li Hung
Chang's machine is still probably the
only machine which writes Chinese
characters.â Pittsburg- Press.

From the diary of Thomas "Creevey,
who lived in England during the early
part 01 last century, the following is
quoted: "Lady Wilton sent over yes
terday from Knowsley to say that the
loco motive machine was to be upon
the railway at such a place at 12
o'clock for the Knowsley party to ride
in if they liked, and Inviting this house
to be of the party. So, of course, we
were at our post in three carriages,
and some horsemen, at the hour ap
pointed. I had the satisfaction, for I
can't call it a pleasure, of taking a trip
of five miles in it, which we did in
Just a quarter of an hour â that is,
twenty miles an hour. As accuracy
upon this subject was mj' great object,
I held my watch in my hand at start
ing and all the time; and as it had a
second hand I knew I could not be de
ceived; and it so turned out there was
not the difference of a second between
the coachee or conductor and myself.
But observe, during these five miles
the machine was occasionally made to
put itself out or go it, and then we
went at the rate of twenty-three miles
an hour, and just with the same ease
as to motion or absence of friction as
the other normal pace. But the quick
est motion is to me frightful; it is real
ly flying, and it Is impossible to divest
yourself of the notion of instant death
to all upon the least accident happen
ing." â Chicago News.

mors about him began to be circulated.
They came almost entirely from a num
ber of men who did not like him, and
on investigation nothing definite was
found. I heard from him very seldom.
Finally some one published what pur
ported to be a story of Bellairs' past,
and pointed out that he was my partic
ular friend, that I sent him to China,
that his attitude toward the civil gov
ernment was at my suggestion and that
I was working to relieve Taft, etc., con
clusions as false as they are childish
and silly. Who started the thing no one
knows, but doubtless some of the peo
ple I had to handle without gloves dur
ing my stay in Cuba. It was i far
fetched and dishonest and intended to
create trouble.
"This is the whole story. Bellairs was
in no way specially intimate with me
or my familyâ that is to say, I do not
think that in all his Cuban service he
was at my table more than three or at
most four times. I saw him daily, as I
did the Sun man, and gave them such
news as I could. They were treated ex
actly alike."
NEW YORK, Dec. 24.â The Commer
cial Advertiser to-day prints a letter
signed by General Leonard Wood and
addressed to Dr. Horace Fletcher of
Yale University, in which the writer
tells of his acquaintance with Edgar G.
Bellairs. In the letter, which was writ
ten at Cairo on May 12 last. General
Wood, referring to Bellairs, said:
"In the spring of 1S99 he was pro
moted to' Havana (from Santiago), not
at my request or suggestion, direct or
indirect, as I remember it. He asked
absolutely no favors of me, or so far as
I know from any one. After my trans
fer to Havana as Governor of the whole
island, in December, 1899, Bellairs con
tinued on duty I should say about five
months, and was then sent to China
and the Philippines â not at my sugges
tion or request, directly or Indirectly.
I was sorry to have him go, as we all
liked him and found him reliable. In
the Philippines Bellairs was a believer
in military government Instead of civil,
and apparently wrote accordingly, and,
of course, trouble with the civil govern
ment in the way of loss of friendly re
lations followed.
COMBINE GRIPS

LTNCHBURG, Va., Dec. 24.â A suit
in equity has been instituted in the
United States Court ; to subject the
stock of the Norfolk and Western Rail
way Company, standing in the name of
L. Laflln Kellogg of New York, who is
alleged to be in reality the attorney
for and trustee of Benjamin D. Green,
"a citizen of Connecticut* temporarily
residing in the city of Quebec," to the
payment of demands alleged to be due
the Government of the United States.
The allegation is that O. M. Carter,
M. Carter, Benjamin â¢ D. Green and
John F. Gaynor conspired to defraud
and did defraud the United States, and
that a portion of Green's share of the
spoils was invested In the name of Kel
logg in 400 shares of common stock of
the Norfolk and Western Railway
Company.
The object of the suit is to enjoin the
transfer of the stock and to sequestrate
it for the benefit of the Government. A
temporary injunction has been
granted. ' \
NEW YORK, Dec. 24.â In spite of
successive legal complications, a small
storm of public protest and some enor
mous practical difficulties, Richard
Wagner's sacred music drama, "Parsi
fal" was produced In the Metropolitan
Opera-house to-night before' an im
ntense audience. The production was
the first performance of the drama out
of Bayreuth.
To give the work the Metropolitan
stage was rebuilt, elaborate mechani
cal appliances and lighting* apparatus
were purchased, and the musical cen
ters of Europex were ransacked to en
gage a corps of experts for every de
partment. To-night's' performance
amounted to a triumph for Director
Conried. In the opinion of every one
who has made the "Parsifal pilgrim
age" to Bayreuth, to-night's perform
ance surpassed all those previously
given.
The audience was brilliant, and
many persons came from Boston, Phil
adelphia, Washington, Baltimore, Chi
cago and other cities.
The performance was begun at 5
o'clock, the opening of the drama and
that of each of its acts being heralded,
after Bayreuth custom, by trumpeters
on the main staircases. The -first act,
ending at 7 o'clock, was followed by a
recess for dinner. The performance
was resumed at 8:45 o'clock and con
cluded at 11:30 o'clock. While some
used the long intermission to drive
home, as a rule dinner was taken in
restaurants.
Much annoyance was caused by the
fact that the play began too soon for
evening dress and ended long after
the time for donning evening garb.
The cast at all important points was
strong, three at least of the principal
actors having learned their parts un
der the tutorage of Frau Wagner.
These were Herr Alois Burgstaller as
Parsifal; Frau Milka Ternina as Kun
dry, and Herr Blass as Gurnemanz.
Anton Van Rooy was Amfortas; P. M.
Marcellos, Titurel, and Herr Otto Go
rltz; Klingsor.
Herr Burgstaller made an admira
ble Parsifal. Herr Blass as Gurne
manz was not altogether satisfactory;
His embodiment lacked the exaltation
and the benignity which Scaria and
Wiegand . gave to the part at Bay
reuth. Measured praise must go to
Herr Goritz, for his Klingsor was but
a mild-mannered magician. Van
Rooy's Amfortas was the be3t thing
he has ever done. He pictured admir
ably the wounded King of the Grail
and in the great scene where, forced
to perform his office, he uncovers the
sacred cup, his acting and singing both
arose to a splendid level.

Under the direction of the chair

reception to all the visiting Sir Knights
and their ladies on some evening dur
ing conclave week. The drill corns is j
.fully reorganized, with som* new ac- j
qcteStions infused into the old. sterling,
ranks, which have won fame ar.d glory
for California, and is now In the best
position to make the most creditable '
showing. The commandery has secured ;
the services of an orchestra of forty
five pieces for the entire week, to play
at. the parades and entertainments and
receptions, afternoon? and evenings.
Fur the purpose of defraying- the ex- j
perse of the lavish entertaining the ;
commandery is accumulating a fund '
which v.ill reach fully $2~>.000 before
next September. The following com- j
pdsÂ« the executive committee: Chair- i

For the purpose of making the most

ized, and is making the most active
preparations for the reception and en
tertainment by the commandery of the
visiting Sir Knights, to sustain Cali
fornia's reputation for hospitality.
TO KEEP OPEV nOUSE.
The current year is one of exceptional
prosperity for California Commandery,
and the greatest in its history for acces
sions to its ranks. Since the present
administration assumed the reins, in
May. 1903, the membership has in
creased by about 150. It v.-as found nec
essary to hold special sessions to confer
tho orders of applicants. The mjjrt
gratifying feature is that so many
young: men have taken orders and aug
mented the ranks of the old sterling
comrr.andery which was organized fifty
years ago.
GOLDEN* GATE OOSIMANDERY.
Almost every one of the 430 members

California Commcndery has undertaken
to do a large share of the entertaining
during conclave -neck, and show spe
cial attention to nil such commanderies
v-hich have been exceedingly hospitable
whenever the Californians visited the
Eastern conclaves.

THE LAWMAKERS
OAKLAND, Dec. 24.â Mrs. Caroline
Cook, an aged woman livingat 1378
Ninth street, was taken to -the deten
tion ward of the Receiving Hospital
this afternoon to be examined as to
her sanity. She says her son-in-law,
L. H. Bell, and his wife are trying to
get her out of the way in order that
they may get her property. Bell says
she threatened his wife's life and his
making the complaint is a matter.of
precaution. â¢
Accuses Son-In-Law.
OAKLAND. Dec. 24. â William
Hamlyn, a tent and awning maker,
residing at 933 Seventh street,, lost
both of his legs at the. Sixteenth-street
station late to-night and will die. He
was run over by a Berkeley local
'train.
Hamlyn was asleep in the railroad
station a greater part of the evening
and at a late hour was driven out by
the watchman and told to go home.
The awning maker had been indulg
ing in too much Christmas celebration
and when he attempted to board a
passing Berkeley train slipped and
fell beneath the wheels, both his legs
being severed from his body.
The unfortunate man was quickly
conveyed to the. Receiving Hospital,
where the surgeons pronounced his a
hopeless case. The Injured man was
47 years o'f age. He has -a wife. -
WILJjIAM IIAMLYX FATAIJjY
INJURED BY BERKELEY TRAIN
PORTLAND, Dec. 24.â The mysteri
ous disappearance of House bill 38 on
the eve of the Legislature's adjourn
ment is puzzling every member who is
not fortunate enough to know the an
swer to the riddle. The bill made gam
bling a felony and would surely have
put an end to public gambling in Ore
gon, as it has already done in Wash
ington. ;
The House representatives passed it
in the face of a strong lobby by a vote
of 31 to 22. It was there placed in an
envelope with two other bills and for
warded by a page in due course to the
Senate. It never reached its destina
tio'n. Somewhere between the desk of
the Speaker of the House and that of
the President of the Senate, the gam
blers' lobby waylaid the envelope. Ab
stracted the bill and substituted .a
dummy properly folded and bearing a
similar indorsement.
It wes on the eve of adjournment
and a special train v.as waiting to take
the legislators home. When the Presi
dent of the Senate opened the envelops,
the gambling bill on which he was'ex
pected'to do some maneuvering was
blank. He adjourned the Senate for fif
teen minutes in order that a quiet In
vestigation might be made by thosi*
Interested, but a search by all the
solons who were eager to vote on the
matter proved fruitless. It was almost
midnight. Those legislators who are
not eager began to drop down to the
special train. Presently there was no
quorum present and the session came
to an end. .}.:â¢/'
Special Dispatch to The Call
Gambling: Measure in the Ore
gon Legislature Disappears
at the Close of the Session
The moot question of Young Cor
bett's weight, which has been interest
ing the followers of boxing since the
little champion settled down to train
ing, were definitely settled yesterday.
After his afternoon's work in the
gymnasium the Denver boxer stepped
on the scales and the beam balanced
at the 132?i-pound mark. This is less
than Corbett weighed on the morning
of his last engagement with Hanlon.
He must weigh 129 pounds at 6 o'clock
next Tuesday at Harry Corbetfs.
"I can sit down now and dry out to
the required weight," said Corbett
after he stepped off the scales. "Han
lon had one look in for the champion
ship, but he need not expect another."
Corbett practically completed his
training yesterday. In the morning he
walked to Stow Lake and enjoyed a
brief spell with the oars and then took
a dip in the ocean. In the afternoon
he went three fast rounds with Monte
Attel. It was give and take through
out and some hard blows were deliv
ered. On the previous day Corbett
sparred with Monte and the latter was
unable to eat his dinner, his teeth were
so sore from contact with the feather
weight's grloves. Monte is ready to
furnish a testimonial as to the cham
pion's hitting powers.
Corbett shows no signs of being
drawn down fine. He is still round and
chubby and seems to have some
fat to spare. It Is evident he will be at
his best this time. He has always been
a famous "repeater," his second fight
with any man being better than his
first.
Corbett and Hanlon will do no more
hard boxing, as they do not want to
risk their hands. Both count on enjoy
ing big dinners to-day, which will
mean some extra road work to-morrow
to get back to the weight they show
this morning.
The betting has opened with Young
Corbett an 8 to 10 choice. It will de
pend on the volume of money offered
on the rival boxers as to how these odds
will fluctuate. There has been but little
betting up to the present time.
The referee question will' be taken up
to-morrow. Corbett says Eddie Gra
ney was good enough for Jeffries, Fitz
simmons, Jim Corbett and other fight
ers and he can see no objection to him
acting on this occasion. Hanlon* has
been non-committal in the matter, and
what Etand he will take is problem
atical.
Harry Pollock, Corbett's manager,
left Chicago last night and is due here
on Sunday night.
ASSOCIATION* FOOTBALIj
MEN* IN* THREE MATCHES
Everything is in readiness for the
great football jrame this afternoon be
tween the Reliance t and th2 Carlisle
teams. Excellent officials have been
selected, the athletes are all in the best
of trim and the field could not be- bet
ter. Each eleven is confident of victory
and the battle is sure to be a hot one.
The contest will commence at 2
o'clock on the Richmond fteM. Man
ager Smith reports a large advance sale
â¢ if tickets and from present indications
there wiil be a big crowd in attendance.
It was expected there would be some
difficulty in regard to the selection of
officials, but the matter was arranged
agreeably to all concerned. "Billy"
Reid of the Belmont school, formerly
a member of a famous Harvara eleven,
will referee. Major Collins, of the same
institution, will umpire. William Sex
ton will be one of the timekeepers and
Donaldson will be one of the stakemen.
The other timekeeper and linesman
have not been chosen as yet.
The Reliance team went out to the
Richmond field yesterday morning and
passed an hour in going through the
signals. Afterward the men were given
the chance to rest up for the big game.
The Indians spent most of tne day in
recreation at the Park, Cliff House and
beach.
Coach Warner thinks his boys need
rest more than practice. He paid yes
terday the redskins should win on a
dry field with straight football.
â¢Peto' Smith is just as certain Re
liance will wjn. He is banking mostly
on the fact that his men are sll veter
ans and have the advantage in weight.
INDIANS ARE FASTER.
The aborigines are much faster than
their opponents. They will have a dis
tinct advantage in this particular. Then
again the whole team plays as one
man, All of them run in the same
manner and one must Fee th*: ball it
self to learn who is carrying it.
Reliance is scores of yards better
than the Indians on punting. The red-
Fkins are more likely to secure field
Roals, as Captain Johnson is a cracker
jack at that feature of tne cÂ«me. Re
liance has a line like a stone wall. The
eopppr-TnnKl warriors will never carry
home any scalps if they attempt to
win with center plays.
The Carlisle backs are swift as deer,
but nre not nearly so strong as those
who wiH curry the pigskin for Reliance.
The palefaces are bound to gain on the
heavy line plays and they have a good
chance to push the "ball through for
FfVeral touchdowns if they play to
gether. Weight alone never wins any
parries against good teams, but it is
one of the powerful factors in making
scores, when combined with skill.
In point of condition the Indians are
far superior, having had the advantage
Â«>f a long season's training. They have
had enough of travel and sightseeing to
keep th?m from growing stale. Sev
eral of Reliance's men will be longing
for wind this afternoon, for the red
skins are planning to play a fast game.
INTEREST IX GAME IS GREAT.
The gridiron experts of the country
are takin? marked interest in the game.
It is the only opportunity afforded by
this year's schedules for comparing
Eastern with Western football. Since
the teams of California have adopted
the graduate system of coaching, some
difference in the style of play of Atlan
tic and Pacific elevens has appeared.
The Western men are not acquainted
with many of the new tricks, but pay
more attention to straight football.
Something has been lost in point of
tpced by the teams of this coast. The
Indians have played against the strong
est teams in the East and a compari
son of scores after to-day's game win
f>e productive of much Interesting data-
The Reliance eleven is probably not
the strongest aggregation that could
be selected from this year's teams, but
it is largely representative of California
football nevertheless. All of the men
are star players and know the game
from kick-off to touchdown. â
The general belief seems to be that
Carlisle will win on speed and team
play. Those who have watched Reli
ance practice are inclined to be doubt
ful of the result. At any rate it will be
a first-class game of football and full of
sensational plays. Neither team can
walk away with the other. The halves
will be a trifle shorter than regulation
time in order that players and specta
tors may not have to hasten too much
to get dinner after the game.
The Indians will witness the perform
ance of 'Foxy Gradpa" to-night at the
California Theater, twenty-two seats
having been secured for the Carlisle
men.
Bowling in Golden Gate Park.
The Christmas interclub match be
tween the San Francisco and the Oak
land Scottish bowlers has been de
Â¦ â¢lared off for several reasons. The
principal reason is the fact that the
green across the bay is not in good
Â« ondition. The failure of the Oakland
club to send a formal written chal
lenge in place of a verbal one is an
other reason for calling off the match.
The large singles event, with ninety
four entries, will be commenced to
cJay. It will continue several months.
Play will be resumed to-morrow af
ternoon.
PHILADELPHIA. Dec 24.â Jack
O'Brien of Philadelphia had the bet
ter of a six-round bout with Jim Jef
fords to-night at the Broadway Ath
letic Club. In the third round Jeffords
had O'Brien a little groggy, but he
soon recovered and held the Advant
age to the end of the fight- Â»
Jack O'Brien Defeats Jeffords.
Thistles Will Play Independents on

SUMMARY.
The feature of the card was the
Mount Lowe handicap, 'worth $1460 to
the winner. It was over a six-furlong
course. There were ten starters and
Golden Rule opened and closed favor
ite. Princess Titanla was second choice
at 2V 2 to 1, and W. B. Sink's entry, The
Fog and F. E. Shaw; was* well liked at
3 to 1. Sink's horses were shipped from
San Francisco last night and arrived
in Los Angeles at 10 o'clock this morn
ing. Notwithstanding the all-night
ride tha horses warmed up well this
morning and were heavily backed by
their owner.
There was never a .doubt nbout the
winner. â¢ The Fog went to the front
at once and finished three and a half
lengths ahead of Lester Ro;ff's Best
Man, which was a length in front of
Rag Tag. The time, 1:14*4; was a cred
itable performance, considering the
newness of the track. Golden Rule
was weighted down with 13S pounds
and was never prominent in the run
ning.
Eleven books cut in and did a rush
ing business. One favorite, Ocean
Dream, which won the first race, was
the best the public could do in picking
winners. San Lution and Strife, win
ners of the second and third races re
spectively, were as good as 20 to J, and
both closed at 15.
The closest finish of the day was in
the fifth race, at a mile and a sixteenth,
which Erne won by a nose trim Glen
rice. Jockey Knapp rode a splendid
race on Erne. *"
Richard Dwyer did the starting while
Colonel A. â¢-W. Hamilton, fid Cole and
Ralph Tozer were in the judges' stand.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 24. -Ascot Park
raco course was thrown open to i the
public td-day and the initial event was
an unqualified success. About 3500
people saw a splendid programme
of six races, all of whlcn wore Inter
esting and two of which furnished nose
finishes.

When Marlin, Cathello and Rionda
fell .on the far turn in the first race
Willie Daly and Anderson escaped un

was not quite so fortunate, having
one of his ankles severely bruised.
Tommy Burns, who rode The . Fog
In the handicap at Los Angeles yester
day, will be seen in the saddle at In
gleside to-day. Tommy's splendid
riding has earned for him a a host of
friends and he is usually found knock
ing at the door, regardless of price or
the class of the horse he may ride. â¢ .
The Christmas handicap, the fea
ture event of the card this afternoon,
with $3000 added money, makes It
one of the rich plums of the racing
season and the field is a high class
one. Claude, the four-time Derby
winner, is* allotted top weight. 123
pounds. The son of Lissak carried a
stouter impost pian this in the Ameri
can; Derby and it would not be sur
prising to see him win. Oarsman is in
grand fettle and .will take a world of
beating.' Proper worked, well and it is
needless to say is ready.' Faulconbridge
is a "mudder.'Vbut can also run some
on a fast track, and Bob Smith is
sweet on his colt's chance. Of the
lightweights, the chances of Eonic
and Forest King look brightest.
v Entries for To-Day.
Trains will leave the depot," Third
nnd Towitsend streets, to-day for In
gleside at 1 and 1:15 p. m.
with the utmost ease,' Kenilwcrth, pi
loted by Otto Wonderly, led Peter J
out for the place.
DICK TUIIPIX IS SPEEDY.
Dick Turpin. the Eastern colt with a
very trim record, was introduced in the
two-year-old fixture, and made himself
right at home. Dick was played from 7
to 5 down to even money, and took
quiie a shine to H. L. Frank, the local
speed marvel and second in demand in
the ring. The latter led almost to the
stretch, where the Eastern visitor, with
Wonderly up, took control of affairs,
disposing of the Cameron entry with
neatness and dispatch, scoring by three
lengths. At the close Military Man was
pressing H. L. Frank hard for second
position.
In the opening six-furlong, number,
decided under selling conditions, three
horses went down on the far turn, their
riders fortunately escaping serious in
jury. The winner turned up in Louis
Wagner, one of the choices, which won
all the. way. Nullah took the place from
Cardwellton.
As an even money betting proposi
tion, Caronal with Hildebrand on his
back, cannot be called a success. The
St, Carlo colt went to the post a 11 to
10 favorite for the mile and a sixteenth
selling selection and, again weakly rid
den, - ran third. Jockey Club, played
from 2*4 to 2, made all the running, and
In a driving finish xlowned Nlgrette
half a length. Caronal finished at the
latter's saddle skirts.
El Orlente, the second cholrp, lost the
last race over a mile to Prestolus, a 16
to 1 shot, by a nose. Jack Martin, who
piloted the outsider, saved a world of
ground by cutting across lots in the
etretch, getting tha decision on the last
stride. Illowaho was third. Hrennus.
the favorite, died away In the stretch.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Immediately after the race Harry.
Green, of Spokane, owner of Sad Sam.'
claimed Money Muss for $102.", the yel
low horse being entered to be sold for
$700. The judges did not exactly like
the complexion of ' afrairs and the
stables of Green and P. C. Donaleche, in
whose name Money Muss races, were
ordered suspended, pending further in
vestigation of the.ract.
A -well balanced card attracted the
full coterie of racegoers and the betting
was heavy. Four favorites, a second
choice and One rank outsider annexed
purses. â
Walter Jennings' crack sprinter Shot
Gun, at odds- of 3 to 5 showed his field
no mercy in the five-and-a-half furlong
purse event The big fellow, with Jack
Martin In the turret, went to the front
when the barrier exploded, and, even
with the emergency brakes called into
requisition, landed his 119 pounds first
Sad Sam. the forlorn half-breed
sprinter, right off the Irons, sizzling
hot. done brown to a turn, made a sor
ry-looking spectacle of his field yester
day in the' .third event at Ingleside.
Latest returns show that -he was
backed off the boards at the track, the
hand books about town. were burned to
a crisp, and the pool rooms at Seattle,
Oklahoma. Spokane, Hong-Kong, Skag
way. Honolulu. Hot Springs, â¢ Kanka
kee. 111..' Cairo. Egypt, and Stockton.
California, are aware by this time that
Money Muss Is no match for the demon
of the jungles. " Â»
In the 'opening betting it was 2Â»Â£ to
1 and take your pick about the two
horses mentioned. Looking a v.vo-horse
affair little consideration was fjiven
Albemarle, St. Winlfride or the other
starters. Along toward po3t time Sad
Sam' had" been played down to i to 5 and
evens, while the odds against the Muss
horse soared skyward. It was another
case of Jack and Jill.
Â¦ Sad Sam won by himself, with Money
Muss and the others tum'ollnjj in after
him. Sherwood, who rode Sad Sam,
evidently had orders to make every
post a lamp post, for he was still rid
ing the favorite when the winning line
was crossed, ten lengths in front.

The official statistics respecting the
births, marriages and deaths registered
In France during the year 1902 have just
been published in Paris. The excess of
births over deaths is shown to have been
83,044, an increase of 11,546 when com
pared with the previous year. This in
crease, however. Is not due to an In
crease.in the number of births but to a
decrease in the number of deaths, seeing
that there were 11.806 births and 24.443
deaths less in 1902 than in 1901. Tfle
figures, therefore, are only apparently
favorable, and the Increase of the popu
lation of France continues to be very
slow indeed. As an example, the statis
tics for the five years from 1896 to 1900
fchow that when the population of this
country increases by 13 inhabitants, in
Germany it increases by 147, in Belgium
by 109, m Great Britain by 116 and in
Italy by 110. The number of marriages
showed a decrease of S683. but divorces
increased by 690. The births numbered
845.37S (431.246 boys and 414.132 girls).
74.071 of the total being 1 illegitimate.
The number of deaths was 761,434 (395.

from Hurley, Wis., who has received
a letter from the East offering him
$1000 for an ear to replace that which
was" taken from its owner in the hos
pital. The Hungarian's name is kept
a secret by the physician, who says
that the call made upon him was pro
fessional, the Hungarian wanting to
know if the operation would be safe.
The doctor thinks that the caller will
undergo the operation, as he was
advised that the process was not dan
gerous.
The Hungarian was applied to. It is
understood, because he was one of
those who responded to the New York
advertisement offering $5000 for an
ear.
Five remarkable patients, who have
arrived from the trans-Caspian terri

St. Petersburg. The heads and bodie3
of these persons are perfectly normal,

appearance of grown-up persons upon
whom the extremities of children of
12 have been fixed. The patients are
descendants of Russian Cossacks who
emigrated to the trans-Caspian terri

Cossacks are deformed in a similar

by a physician sent by the Govern

A small kitten; the property of John
M. Yore, 710 First avenue, St. Joseph,
Mich., is dead. That fact itself Is not
startling, but the manner of the kitten's
death is so unusual that It has aroused
much Interest on the part of neighbors,
physicians and veterinarians in this
city.
The kitten, in a moment of excessive
playfulness twelve days ago, swallowed
a hatpin. The animal was only four
months old, and of the usual size for
such an age. The hatpin was seven
inches lons\ with a stone, head. Mr.
Yore noticed the kitten piayirfg' with
the ornament, which came from his
daughter's hat. Soon afterward the
pin was missing. Search w&3 futile,'
and the kitten, which continued to be
as sportive as ever, gave no symptoms
of distress until a few days ago, when
it became 111 and subject to fits. This
started a controversy In the household.
One side asserted that the kitten had
swallowed the hatpin. The other ridi
culed the idea as physically impossible.
Neither would weaken, however, and
finally Mr. Yore became convinced
that the only means of solution of the
mystery lay in a searching examina
tion of pussy's anatomy. > No X-ray
being handy, chloroform and a knife
Were used. The result was the recov
ery of the hatpin at the cost of the
cat's life. The pin had been swallowed,
Its white. head going down first, the
metal- body following until the point
found a lodging place in the
animal's throat. Before the \ dis
section took - i lace the case was
placed before a physician and two
veterinarians. In their opinion they
declared. that the kitten could not have
swallowed a pin of such length. Later
when the pin was produced and shown
to them they expressed much aston
ishment.âChicago Inter Ocean.

The passengers and crew of the
North German Lloyd steamship Han
nover, Captain Jacobs, which arrived
yesterday from Bremen, were treated
to a novel spectacle a few days ago,
while off Newfoundland Banks, where
a large iceberg was sighted, and on the
great mountain of Ice, perambulating
about from cliff to cliff, were six # large
polar bears. The berg was several
miles from the Hannover, but the bears
were plainly visible with the naked eye
to those cm the vessl, but through a
glass the huge animals could be seen
swinging their ponderous heads to and
fro as they walked aDout on their
floating home. How- the bears got on
the berg and their probable fate afford
ed food for much speculation among
the passengers as' they stood on the
deck and watched the mountain of ice
and its prisoners 'growing smaller in
the distance as night came on. Spring
Is the usual- seasdn for Icebergs, and
the presence or the piece of an Arctic
glacier- on' the Atlantic at this time of
the year is unusual. The bears were
evidently on the Iceberg- when it glided
froni the share into the Atlantic Ocean.
It will drift south until melted to noth
ing by the warn> waters of the , Gulf,
stream. The Iceberg was sighted In lat
itude 44.54 north and longitude 48.29
west. -

The building is of stone and it has
been known for nearly a century as
the "'76 house.". . Presumably it was
built in .that year. It was a tavern
when Andre was confined there and it
is a tavern still. For many years prior
to its partial destruction in 1897 it
had been unoccupied, and it was,
therefore, in poor condition to with
stand the strong winds. Immediately
after it was purchased by Charles A.
Pike, a native of Tappan, who re
stored the house as nearly as possible
to its former state. One room, how
ever, has been converted into a bar
room, and it is the resort for the gayer
element in the little village. Directly
across the hall is the Andre prison
room, which is carefully preserved for
the inspection of visitors.
Major John Andre, the British of
ficer who was hanged as a spy in the
Revolutionary War by order of Gen
eral Washington, is to this day regard
ed more as a victirn of circumstances
than as one guilty of the charge of
which he -vvas convicted. The house
in which he was imprisoned previous
to his execution still stands in the little
village of Tappan, near the border line
between New York and New Jersey,
about twenty-one mites from- New
York. The house is practically the
same now as it was 123 years ago, al
though a storm in March, 1897, de
stroyed part of the house and leveled
a side wall, which has been rebuilt,
however. * '
The house has long been an object
of interest to tourists and it has lately
attracted some attention because of
the resurrection of the theme of An
dre's death by Clyde Fitch, the play
wright, who has laid the scenes of his
last act in the play "Major An,dre,"
now running at the Savor Theater, in
this celebrated house.

Christmastide flowed merrily in
United States Commissioner Heacock's
court yesterday. The Judge had an
nounced in the beginning of the. week
that he intended to take a ten days*
vacation, and when a procession of
lawyers walked in at 10 o'clock yes
terday forenoon his countenance fell
at the prospect of more work on the
eve of the great Christmas holiday.
"What do they mean by coming in
here with more business when they
know I want to get away on my vaca
tion?" he muttered under his breath.
Judson Brusie, the playwright au
thor of "I. O. U.," stepped forward
and began to spout hot air. Before
the Judge could recover from his
amazement Mr. Brusie, in the name
of the United States District Attor
ney's office and of the lawyers prac
ticing before the court, presented the
upright Judge with a beautiful cut
crystal water set with silver trim
mings. ; Mr. Brusie made a flowery
speech on behalf of the members of
the Federal bar, conveying their sen
timents of esteem and confidence.
Then D. D. Jones, better known as
"Peacon" Jones, came In for a glad
surprise. Mr. Jones is a Welshman,
but he speaks Chinese as well. In his
official capacity as Chinese interpreter
for the District Attorney's office and
in his personal capacity as managing
editor of the missionary magazine en
titled "Mongolian Pagans . Snatched
From the Burning," he received a
fountain pen fllagreed with silver. Mr.
Jones was so much affected that he
clothed his reply in Welsh and Can
tonese.
. A. B. Kreft, the courteous clerk of
Judge Heacock, -was presented with a
silver match box appropriately in
scribed, i /
The condition of the Bress or Naugh

In her room in a house at 207 Tehama
street about 9 o'clock last night. Mrs.
Rneider was having a drunken carousal
in her room with a woman named
Bress, who said she was the wife of one

In the midst of the Christmas eve

by the drunken women and Mrs.
Sneider's clothing caught fire. The fire
department was summoned by outsid

The most noticeable development of
recent times has been that of independ
ent telephone companies when com
pared with the business of the Bell
Company, at one time in practical mo
nopoly of the business. That the lat
ter comDany, though by far the the
strongest in all ways individually, no
longer controls the situation is too pa
tent to deny, nor is there anything par
ticularly discreditable to it inthe'fact.
Modern social and business develop
ment has proceeded more rapidly than
it lay within the power of any one con
cern to cope with, even were it not
handicapped . V.y tl:e loss of control of
expired fundamental patents and the
passing into other hands of the owner
ship of improvements. It has done a
great Work, and no one owes the Bell
Company more credit than do the vari
ous independent companies.
To-day the telephone is everywhere
âin office^, factories, trains, steam
ships, churches, on the farmland this
latter application is noteworthy for its
rapidly increasing adoption). War as
well as Deace' calls for it. To prophesy
its .future is. beyond any one. One thins
can be f oresetÂ«n in this (a table show
ing that in 188 towns in 16 States there
are 158.393 independent telephones,
against 84323 BelK.phones) and all such
tables, and that is, as a unification of
Bell and independent interests is con
cededly out of the question, that side
which gains a great economic advan
tage oter the other will achieve a com
manding position of tremendous sig
nificance, whether, such advantages be
localized or general. The immediate
necessity for such economy is in the
field of operating expensesâ the heav
iest item.â Cent Per Cent.

SOUTH NOBWALK, Conn.. Dec. 21.
Tn a thick fog early this n:orninÂ«r tho
steamer ISrastus Corning, of the Star-
Jne line, bound fioni New Haven for
N>w York, with thirty passengers and
;i heavy carpro of freight, struck on the
rocks off Copps Island just outside
.Norwalk harbor. A hole two feet square
eras Stove in the side of the steamer
and within five minutes she sank in
tiftr-en feet of water.
"The sole object of the invention is,
of course, the reduction of friction, and
that it seems to have accomplished
wonderfully by the shortening of the
shaft and the hollow bottom. On our
present ocean liners the propellers are
all out at the end of the boat. The en
gines are located in the center and the
shaft is necessarily long, connecting
these two points."â New York Adver
tiser.' Â¦
"To be able to cross the Atlantic in
three and a half days will be an ac
complished fact in perhaps a very
short time from now if an invention
which Is at present being worked out
in a shipbuilding yard on the Clyde
for the attainment of that object is
successfully completed and put to the
test, and there are very encouraging
prospects in the present state of the
invention of its proving an entire suc
cess," said Carl D. Flint, an ex-lieu
tenant in thÂ«\ royal navy and now a
naval constructor for Harland &
j Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilders, who
arrived here last Wednesday from Ire-
I land. His visit is unofficial, but while
here he is* making a tour of some of
our principal shipbuilding yards in
order, he says, to get a general idea
as to the progress being made on this
side in ship construction. Mr. Flint
is the guest of Lewis Nixon. He made
j a visit to the navy yard at Washing
j ton recently.
i 'Little or nothing has been said as
| yet about the invention," Mr. Flint
! continued. "It will not mean a revo
! lution in the present style of floating
i craft, but simply a ship with a sort
of arched bottom, and a change in the
position and shape of the propellers.
There will be no keels, but, Instead,
what might be called a double or
; twin hull, after the style of the cata
maran. Such a hull will prevent the
boat from rolling, and, therefore, do
away with what is to the majority one
of the most^ disagreeable features of
ocean travel. As for the new screw
propellers, they will be moved further
up in the 1 body of tjie vessel. i and built
in ridges formed by the twin keels be
ing a part of them.
"In all liners as built at present the
screw propellers, you know, come out
on each side of the stern. The ad
vantage claimed for the new idea â
that is, the screw and hull together â
â¢are twofold; first, on account of the
position of the screws being removed
from the stern, the tremendous suction
power which always follows a vessel,
greatly retarding her spred, is carried
off to the stern by the two keels; sec
ondly, the propellers are rendered much
more powerful because their diameter
and consequent grasp of thÂ» water is
very much greater. In every propeller
now being used on steamships there is
much lost power in the center of the
whirling blades. An electric fan is a
form of propeller. It forces air out
instead of water. If you place your
hand in the center of an electric fan
you will find that there is no air. The
breeze comes from the outside edges
of the blades. The same is true of all
steamship propellers In use nt present.
and it means a great loss of power.
That defect has been remedied, how
ever, in the new propeller, by making
it nothing but blades and placing a
solid metal wheel or hub on the pro
peller shaft and setting the Hades on
it. The scheme, of course, would be of
no practical benefit if applied to our
present liners, because the wheel of
the propeller, being large, would catch
the water and tend to retard the pro
gress of the boat with its solid bottom.
"As I have explained, however, the
new vessel has an arched or shallow
bottom along its whole length, and
that secures a flow 'of water under the
center of the boat equal to that along
the sides and establishes a bearing for
the new propeller equal in diameter to
the large hub wheel upon which the
propeller blades are fastened. The pro
peller'is 15 feet long from the center of
the shaft to the tip of the blade and the
whole circle is more than 90 feet. The
Deutsehland's propeller is exactly one
foot shorter than the new. one.
If .i baby is tv.ir weeks old, for in
stanco, nino bottles, each of them con
taining one an<J a half ounces of milk,
are delivered. This gives the little one
thirteen and a half ounces per day,
which is exactly the 'amount it needs.
For a year-old baby fnrty-two ounces
of milk will be sent in six bottles of
seven ounces each. As it is intended
only fcr the poor, the milk is sold at
the cheapest â¢possible rate, as may be
judged from the" fact that sufficient
milk to feed a baby under six months
old for a week may be obtained for 1
shilling and '- pone?.
The Municipal Couneil of Battersea
has lately been trying a unique exper
iment. The -death rate among infants
having become so large, mainly on ac
count of the disease germs in milk,
tho result of keeping it in stuffy living
rooms and dirty larders. Battersea de
cided to see what could be done toward
supplying pure and proper nourishment
for little folk. A depot has boen estab
lished at which pure sterilized milk,
hygienlcally bottled, can bo obtained
in proper quantities, according to the
agÂ° "f the child. That is to say, each
baby is being supplied with exactly the
amount of milk which it requires, the
depot delivering it each day in air tight
butties.
BATTKREAS MILK DEPOT.
Glasgow, however, is by| no means
the only town with a go-ahead Munici
pal Council. Swansea possesses one of
tho finest general markets in the three
kingdoms. Belfast and Preston, as
well as other towns, have municipal
slaughter houses and meat markets.
Brighton owns and manages its own
race track, while Tunbridgo Wells pos
sesses municipal theaters. Manchester,
too. lightens the taxpayers' burden
with profits from a municipal candle
factory, while Liverpool assists its in
habitants in the same manner by ov.n
ins and managing a beet farm.
Glasgow has also invested, among
other things, in a tulip farm, a laun
dry, a dog and bird store and an old
clothes market. The profits derived
from the two latter concerns, by the
bye, are devoted to the support of the
old town's municipal art studio and
picture gallery. The old clothes mar
ket was built at an outlay of Â£^000.
and whereas formerly the "old clo' "
man was allowed to hawk his wares
in the public streets, he now has to rent
a stall in the market and thus help oth
er taxpayers. The dog and the bird
market adjoins the old clothes market,
fanciers having to pay similar rents,
while the tulip farm was eteablidhed
in order that the city's parks and pub-
Ik- gardens might be decorated at less
expense than was entailed through
buying plants each year from bulb
dealers.
GLASGOW RUNS PAWN SHOPS.
It was also on account of the very
high interest which pawnbrokers
charged their customers that the mu
nicipal authorities of Glasgow decided
srimf time ago to establish pawnshops
<>f their own. The city now possesses
throe of these shops, bought outright
fronr the original owners, which have
taken an enormous amount of business
away from the "trade." The rate of
interest charged at a municipal pawn
shop is one penny for every five shill
ings borrowed, whereas the interest at
other shops is five and six times that
amount.
Perhaps the city's ; ost singular
echer-" was that of Tjunding municipal
golf links a year or so ago. This
scheme was inaugurated on account of
tlio fact that the only golf links in and
mund about Glasgow were at one time
owned by a few clubs, which charged
players an exorbitant subscription.
Complaints having been made- to the
proper quarter by people who were pre
vented from playing on account of the
excessive fees, the Glasg Municipal
Council laid out its own links, pro
vidpd tho necessary caddies, etc., and
placed them flt the disposal of the pub
lic at a very cheap subscription. Need
less to say, these links were an imme
diate success and the profits derived
from them have helped to a certain ex
tent to keen down the ordinary taxa
tion.
Tho prosperous city of Glasgow can
bcnst of many distinctions, !.-.:t none so
remarkable as its municipal undertak
ings, rays Tid-IJits. Glasgow may be
said to be the most municipalized* city
in the world, for, in addition to owning
nud managing its street car lines, tele
phono system, electric light, gas plants,
water, etc., the Municipal Council con
trols a number of other more curious
enterprises for thp benefit of its inhab
itants.
Xo one knows what those spots really
signify or what causes them. The
knowledge that we have of the sun's
constitution is based upon the. discov
eries of the spectrum. That has taught
scientists, without the chance of error,
that certain chemical constituents
which are known in the earth are also
existent and operative in that vast
globe which we only know by its gase
ous envelopes.
Of its interior character absolutely
nothing is known, though much is in
ferred from this present phenomenon,
as well as from the revelations of the
telescope, combined with those of the
spectroscope, at the occasions of the
eclfpses, both total and partial, and it is
To discover more truly the nature of the
body on which the life of the earth and
our whole planetary system depends
that expeditions are sent out by almost
every civilized nation to observe these
periodical observances. "What may be
discovered no one can venture to say.
but it , is certain that nothing has yet
been found to establish a direct answer
from our earth to the strange action of
the sun in either the spots, the shining
feculae or the great protuberances of
hydrogen which are shown on the occa
sion of eclipses, projected 250,000 miles
beyond the common sphere of the solar
apparition.
It is elementary to say that the sun
has a luminous cloud shell or wrapper,
no one knows how deep, but the guess
is 2000 miles, which is the source of
light. It is thought this is mainly car
bon, but it may be some other incan
descent refractory vapor under the in
fluence of heat. There ha3 been enter
tained a theory that the sun Is in
ternally cold and that the effect upon
our atmosphere is that of these blazing
carbon vapors. Now it is thought that
the effect we see as '"spots" is produced
by the falling into the body of the sun
of material from without^ such as aero
lites, meteors or whatever the residuum
may be called of exploded bodies,
whether of gas or otherwise, condensed
in the upper regions of the solar at
mosphere.
Of course when it is said that the
connection of the sun's phenomena with
those of earth is undetermined It is not
meant that no such connection exists.'
Too many observations â they number
several thousand since the telescope,
the spectroscope and the photograph
have been- jointly and comparatively
employedâ have shown that the mag
net** needle, the telegraph wires, the
compass, are all affected by the fre
quency and extent of sun spots. But
there is nothing at all conclusive, yet
arrived at in respect to storms over*. the
surface of the earth or to cold waves
or heated terms. In fact, hea"ted terms
especially are not explicable * 7 any ob
servations that have been made. It is
an interesting subject and the astron
omers are continually busy in trying to
find out more. But there is nothing in
sun Â«"'Â»ots on which to nourish super
stitious apprehensions â Chicago
Chronicle.
The spots that have been observed
on the surface of the sun for several
months past have given rise to much
discussion in the scientific world. Al
though much speculation has been in
dulged in. people are as much in the
dark as ever as to what causes these
spots and what their probable effect
will be upon other planets, especially
upon the one we live on. 'AX has been
estimated that the present chain of
these spots is about 17S.000 miles Ions
and nearly 00,000 miles wide. As the
visible sun is about 26.000.000 miles in
circumference, a similarly extensive
disturbance on the earch. which is
about 25,000 miles in circumference,
would involve about 873 miles in ex
tent. The earth moves around its axis
once in twenty-four hours. The sun'a
rotation is about twenty-seven days
and the procession of the spots con
tinues for nearly a fortnightâ that is.
the disappearance of the spot occurs
in about that time from the first dis
play. The maximum of spot manifes
tations takes place at intervals of
somewhat near eleven years â the last
previous one was in 1S94. Some of tlM
biggest groups of spots have lasted
through three revolutions of the sun;
the last to do so was the group of 1SD*.
which was visible to the naked eye.
through smoked glass, from September
to the end of November. This was
about 85,000 miles long and 35,000 broad,
quite inferior to the present one.
Attempts are made to create- a sen
sational apprehension of same great
cataclysmal occurrence relating direct
ly to our planet, and there are proph
ecies of '"terrific electrical disturb
ances." But as a matter vt fact no
clear connection between thpse phe
nomena and the storms that visit us
in our atmosphere has ever been de
termined. It is supposed that such con
nection existsâ that is all. It Is folly
to make alarmist forecasts such as we
see in too many papers. It Is not
shown even that the sun spots lessen
the heat of the sun or Increase it. Of
course, the further attempt to make
commercial crises depend on these
quite inexplicable phenomena is sheer
nonsense. Descriptions of the sun spot3
as great conflagrations bursting out in
the gases which form the envelope
which to us represents the sun, of
tongues of flame "millions of miles,"
making a "raging furnace," are equally
nonsense. .

Ha v and Feedstuff s.
Both Hay and Feedstuffs rqraaln about as be
fore quoted. The Government has opened the
bids already mentioned for 5435 tons of Â¦ Hay
and 4320 tons of Oats for Manila. The north Is
$4 lower than San Francisco on the Oats, but
J5 higher en the . Hay, so it Is not yet known
where the ofder will be placed.
The circular of Somcrs & Co. eaya of Hay:
"Shipments of hay have been somewhat
lighter the total" arrivals for the last week
amounting to but 2250 tons, In comparison with
2050 for the week previous. Concerning the lo
cal situation we have. nothing new to report,
for the market shows practically no change, In
any way. Â¦'".'.
1 VThe Government has opened .bids -"for 5400
tons of hay for Manila shipment. It Is confi
dently expected that this order will be placed
here. If It Is.. of course, the market is bound
to stiffen up and prices will in all_probabllity
advance. As will be remembered, when . an
account of stock was. taken on the 1st" of .No-'
vember it was found ,that there was hardly
:nore than ..enough 'hay .to last- tho^-season

The market" for dressed Turkeys was very
weak yesterday, owing to the. abundance -of
poor stock and the heavy offerings of Western
chilled, and there was a sharp break in prices.
The receipts of Callfornlan were about 50 tons,
and there was a heavy carry-over of poor qual
ity offerings from the preceding day. At the
opening" the best offerings of local stock were
1 held at 24(J?25c " per- pound, but the market
' weakened when large lines ot Western chilled
were thrown on it, and prices receded
until prim* fancy stock was selling ati 20c
Poor' stock was hard to dispose of even at the
minimum quotation, and there was, quite a
heavy surplus unsold at the close. Holders
of Western chilled were forcing sales at 20Â© j
' 21c, -and larse .quantities were sent back to \
; the icehouses. Live Turkeys were in ample .
supply and weaker in sympathy with dressed. 1
All 1 ther Â¦ descriptions 'of Poultry were very!
dull' with prices largely nominal. In fact, no j
reasonable offer was refused for chickens.

The firmness In Hops continues, though as
usual the holidays will probably check the de

of the quantity still on hand. It is known,
however, that the great bulk of the crop all
over the coast has been sold. The British

This process of filling up the gaps In values
cauwd by the drastic liquidation effected dur
ing the year hag been viewed with a contented
spiiit In the financial world, where the showing
to be maile in annual balance sheets of the
market values of securities held will cut an
irrrortant figure and has been the occasion of
, some anxious consideration at different times
d-Jrinp the distressing year just closing. How
far active measures have been used In the
market to help this improvement is a matter
for surmise. But the fact that the result has
come with little effort proves the flrm under
lying condition in the present market. Fore
houinffs over the year-end money markets are
definitely laid to rest and the ease of the money
market has been greater during the paat week
than for any correspondine period for many
y^ars. But this freedom from any pressure for
credits has not resulted in any free use of
thorn for speculative uses. Savings banks in
New York have determined to maintain the
existing Interest rate, and several savings banks
in Brooklyn have advanced their rate from 3U
to 4 per cent. But '-- - employment of money
in the present market is checked by considera
tion of the heavy requirements for railroad bond
issues which are known to overhang the money
market, gome Cf these will be for the purpose
of funding temporary loans to railroads during
the past period of stringency to carry on neces
sary work with the intention of waitins for
more propitious conditions to issue long-time
loans in funded form. The official intimation of
purpose to employ nart of the proceeds of these
coming bond issues in purchase of railroad
equipment has been a stimulating: Influence
upon securities of corporations dealing in such
equipment. The usual factors of unsettlement
and hesitation of a national campaign lie be
yond, with the added uncertainties of the in
dustrial and business outlook and the hoped-for
turn in the tide of contraction of the past
year. Opinions are still fixed on the iron and
FtÂ«*5l outlock, but are by no means so generally
pessimistic as w a s the case a few weeks ago.
Dealings in bends have not been on a large
scale for the week, but there has been a de
mand awakened for a few Issues of a specu
lative class.

been contetnDlat*<i with some cheerfulness in
Â«a!l street. While the market has bÂ»en rx
ceodincly dull and at times practically stag
nant, the ffTect has been to keep any selling
pressure off the market and prices have been
suffered to advance in a sluggish manner. Some
cf the dormant stocks have been bid up many
points without transactions and very light
offerings have been brought out at any stage of
the advance. The Fame has been true in a
moderate derree of the stocks active in the

Trade in the fruit market was quiet, aa Tur
keys still occupied the time and attention of
buyers, and most of the buying had been done
on the preceding rfay. Well-colcred Navel Or
anges were still scarce and readily command
ed full figures, but poorly colored etock. which
was abundant, continued very dull. Apples and
other tree fruits were unchanced, with sup
plies more than sufficient for requirements. Re
ceipts of Strawberries consisted of 42 cheÂ»tÂ»
Malindaa and 10 chests of Longworths. The
former sold slowly at- $2 50-@3 50 per chest, and
the latter sold in a peddling way at JOii v A
chest of Raspberries came In from Hay ward*
and sold quickly at â¬0c per drawer. Grapes
arrived in small quantities and were in good
request at J 1 50 per crate. The market was
heavily supplied with Bananas and prices were
unchanred. -* â¢

â¢ Cheese is very weak. The- shelves in the
commission houses are full and the demand is
slow and dealers are making concessions to
effect sales. A good deal cf choice Cheese is
being worked off at 12c.
Ranch and store Eggs are still lower, the
latter especially, as receipts are Increasing.
Buyers are holding off. and stocks are grad
ually growing larger.

Butter continues quiet and weak, with the
bulk of the stock in the hands of half a dozen
houses, who are quoting 25c as the top for
the best creameries. Those houses not over
stocked are quoting up to 2t>c, but this figure
is ratber extreme. Receipts were heavy yes
terday, as will be seen, and considering that to
day Is a holiday and to-morrow practically one,
with Sunday following;, the outlook is for a
heavily supplied market next Monday. Of
course this condition edds to the weakness.

James W. Whiting, one of the pio

For the last five years he had been iu
poor health, but had been able to at
tend to business until Â¦within the last
two weeks. HÂ« was one of the found

Pioneer J'alled by Death.
The suit brought by Mrs. Crissy Mc-
Allon to annul her marriage to C. J.
McAllon was decided yesterday by
Judge Cook in favor of the' plaintiff
and an order was made declaring the
marriage annulled.
Considerable interest was taken in
the suit from the fact that Mrs. Mc-
Allon while testifying in court alleged
that at* the time she was married to
McAllon in San Jose on January 18,
1901. she was under a hypnotic spell.
McAllon "she" said had repeatedly hyp
notized her and had made her do silly
things such as eat soap in the belief
that it was candy and fish for trout in
a cuspidor.
Dr. J. Mclvor-Tyndall was called as
an expert witness and testified that a
woman under a hypnotic, spell, if the
suggestion were made to her to get
married, would get in that line of
thought and no one could .tell by her
actions or demeanor that she was under
such a epell.- She would not know her
self what had happened till the spell
was removed by some other test. He
had seen the plaintiff and said she
would make an easy subject.
In her complaint -Mrs. ' McAllon ad
mitted that at the time she .was mar
ried to McAllon she had a, husband
from whom she had not been divorced,
and the Judge in giving his decision
orally yesterday said it was, not neces
sary for him to go into- the question
of hypnotism, as the woman's previous
marriage was eufflcient t to annul her
marriage to McAllon..
The question, therefore/ of what:ef
fect hypnotism would rive ' in. dis
solving the marital ties remains unde

yesterday morning and when turning
the corner of Harrison street two
men approached himand one of them
ordered him to throw up his hands.
"We want all the money, you've

Collins declined to throw up his hands
the other footpad struck him on the
head with a "blackjack," knocking
him down. One of them jumped upon
him and Collins cried for help.
Collins' crie3 were heard by E. R.
Steinwand, a mail carrier, and he
drove in the direction of the sound.
When the two footpads saw the wag
on approaching they ran away. Stein
wand assisted Collins into his wagon
and drove him to the Harbor Emer
gency Hospital, where a wound in his
scalp was stitched and dressed. He
was able to give a description of the
men.

Sentence Passed Upon Davis.
Howard W. Davis, a colored man,
who was tried before a Jury in Judge
Dunne's court on a charge of assault
with Intent to ,rob and was convicted
of simple assault, was sentenced yes
terday to serve ninety days in the
County Jail. Davis and a companion
attempted to hold up John Freel, a
marine fireman, on Jackson street,
near Drumm.
Mrs. Sarah Rogers, widow of
"Ducksy" Rosenbaum, who is one of
the well-known characters of the city,
appeared in Judge Conlan's court yes
terday, gorgeously appareled, to tell
her version of the assault which she
claims was made on her at Larkin
street and Pacific avenue a week ago
by Louis F. Marshall, a race track ha
bitue. Mrs! Rogers told the court that
as she was walking along on her way
home with her arms full of packages
Marshall struck her and knocked her
down. When she arose he knocked
her down a second time and kicked her
in the back of the head.- She arose
again and was felled for the third
time, she claimed. George Marshall,
she said, was present and begged his
brother to desist after the first assault,
but his pleas availed nothing.
Alfred Friefz testified that he saw
some people fighting on the corner
and one of them. was a woman. He
could not identify any of the combat
ants.
The defense offered no testimony,
merely cross-examining Mrs. Rogers.
She denied that she had struck Mrs.
Louis Marshall at the race track. She
Rdmitted that she had shook her fist
In the face of Marshall's wife, and
when asked why she did that an
swered that it was because Louis Mar
shall was the biggest thief in Amer
ica. Further hearing of the case went
over until December 30.
Samuel Hargreaves, the Petaluma*
real estate dealer, who persistently de
clined to contribute to the support of
his 10-year-old child, has been con
verted to a better view of his marital
affairs under the skillful guidance of
Judge Mogan. His wife appeared in
court yesterday and told the Judge
that the husband had given the little
girl $10 for Christmas and had made
other provisions that were highly sat
isfactory. Accordingly the charge of
failing to provide for the little girl
was dismissed.
Angelina Archibald will have to an
swer before the Superior Court for
grand larceny and until she manages
to secure bail in the sum of $2000 will
languish j in jail. Such was the de
cision of Judge Mogan after he had
listened to the cause yesterday. An
gelina is a half-breed Indian who
abandoned the peaceful -wickiup for
a career of crime in the centers of
civilization. A miner from Arizona
made her acquaintance and it cost him
$420, which she filched from his
pocket. During her hearing in court
she reviled the Judge and bailiffs and
her removal to jail gave much relief
to the overstrained officials.
William H. Owens, who was arrest
ed, together with Harry Howard, for
the robbery of William Little in a sa
loon at 760 Market street, was held to
appear before the Superior Court yes
terday by Judge Mogan. Owens is a
Missouri farmer and was exonerated by
Hbward of complicity in the crime. The
Judge said he was inclined to believe
the accused man Innocent, but he
thought it better to have him tried by
a jury of his peers. If he were acquit
ted by them the vindication would be
greater and the incident would leave no
stain on his future life, f
William Hall has been making a
nuisance of himself among the private
residences on Stanyan street. He would
apply for alms on . the plea that â¢ he
wished to get money to go to his moth
er in Los Angeles. When he was re
fused money he became abusive and in
sistent. The assistance of a policeman
was secured finally and Hall was taken
to jail. He appeared before Judge Mo
pan yesterday and was sentenced to
the County Jail for thirty days. In ad
dition he received a tobasco roast de
livered in the Judge's best style, which
may cause him to think better of a
beggar's career when he is at liberty
again.

Thomas Hill, colored, and Fred Tuck
er, a white man, were sentenced to six
months and three months, respectively,
by Judge Mogan yesterday on the
charge of vagrancy. They are "strong
arm" men and have been infesting
Third and Market streets for a month.
Last Saturday night they robbed an old
man of ?1 and managed to lose him be
fore they could be apprehended. More
over they succeeded in inducing James
Hoffman, the beautiful young man who
tends to the cigarette department of
the Bohemian cigar stand, to give them
52 In exchange for three quarters and
two dimes. "Handsome Jim" was on
the witness stand to tell his troubles
to -a sympathizing court. During his
examination he tried to get fresh, and
the Judge warned him to preserve a
reasonable degree of dignity, otherwise
he would be committed to jail for con
tempt. Judge Megan didn't want to be
called "k-i-d" in open court.
Bailiffs Mahoney and Hickey of Judge
Mogan's court will enjoy Christmas
cheer at the expense of the enlightened
jurist who presides over the. tribunal.
After the sheep and the goats had been
properly separated before the seat of
judgment and were sent on their way
to freedom or given the punishment the
laws provide for the wrongdoers, the
bailiffs were called before the bar of
justice. To them Judge Mogan deliv
ered sentence that each must take a
big turkey home, have it properly pre
pared and eat as much of it as the re
mainders of the families could not con
tain on Christmas day. The sentence
was received in silence by the defend
ants.

TWO MEN ASSAULT AND TRY
TO STEAL A SAILOR'S COIN
There will be a grand minstrel show
participated in by the traveling men,
and they promise to discount anything
in that line ever seen.
W. J. Hynes, Public Administrator
elect, who is connected with the City
of Paris, will lead the "end men" and
will- be assisted by S. O. Hall, J. Ein
stein, W. T. Hobson, E. C. Lambert,
F. B. Wade and W. V. Freeman. H.
Brown will serve as interlocutor and
has a, brand of jokes never before seen
on the market.
Bandleader Charles Cassasa and his
orchestra will furnish the music and
special numbers will be presented by
members of the theatrical companies
playing at the theaters, by members
of the Olympic Club and a choir cf
church singers.
The committee in charge of the bene
fit entertainment consists of Oscar
Boldman, chairman; H. J. Juddell, sec
retary; H. P. Gettleson, treasurer;, Al
Enqulst,' George Borchardt, J. Ij.
ftogers and Charles B. Thompson.
The organization was formed ten
years ago and the members have al
ways entertained their friends annual
ly with a dance and a banquet. This
year the sick list of members has been
a very large one, and for that reason
it was decided to give a public benefit
to raise funds.
The traveling men will certainly give
the public full value for its money,
judging by the programme that has
been prepared for next Wednesday's
entertainment.
The "drummers" that make San
Francisco their headquarters have a
reputation of being "good fellows" and
they are ever ready to respond to a
call for financial assistance.
For the purpose of aiding the treas
ury of the Golden Gate Council of the
United Commercial Travelers, which
has been depleted on account -of nu
merous calls on account of illness of
members, a special benefit performance
will be given at the Alhambra Theater
next Wednesday evening, and it prom
ises to be one of the most successful
of its kind ever given in this city.
The plaintiff in the caso claims that
the money can be recovered by due
process of law under a constitutional
provision, although no consideration
was passed when the margins were
paid.
The v.rit directed the Sheriffs depu
ties to levy on any moneys in the pos
session Â«f H. A. Morse. W. E. Bains,
John R. Corycjl, John A. Walls and
Joseph Jarne?, stockholders of the Cen
tral Grain and Stock Exchange. The
man who carried the sack of coin was
considerably surprised when the sack
was taken from him by the deputies,
t" ho immediately afterward garnisheed
certain moneys belonging to the con
cern new <>n deposit in the Bank <~>f
California and with th? Union Trust
Company.
It was a busy day fc-r attachments
in the Sheriff's office. One was served
on John Keefe of 110 First street at
the instance of the San Francisco Com
mercial Agency, which lias sued to re
cover the sum of 52762 ''4 for goods fur
nished and delivered.
Another attachment was served by
D. E. Besecker r>n Charles Rollo Peters,
who haÂ«= beer, sued by thÂ» Kennedy-
Rabjohn Ccmrany for $y67 37 for money
loaned on a promissory note and goods
sold to Peters. The Phrrift* seized two
pictures row on exhibition at the Bo
hemian Club and belonging to Peters.
They are notab!#> works of art â "The
Finch HousV and "Casa Del Mar "â
and are valued at considerably more
than the amount of the attachment.
Still another attachment in the sum
of $1000 was served at the instance of
G. O. Heine against the Ford Motor
< ompany. the objective article being a
motor rar now in the hands of the
S<-uthÂ»rn Pacific Company at its Lag
gage shed.'
Â¦ The Sheriff's deputies sweoped down
â¢ <n an attache of the Central Grain and
Slock Exchange as he was leaving the
ofner" of thf concern at HO LeidesdorfC
street yesWrday with a bag of coin
slung over his shoulders. The bag con
tained $4000 in twenty-dollar gold pieces
and was levied upon by thp deputies
<>n a writ of attachment on the
stockholders of the exchange at the in
stance of George -Ooettinger. as as-
Bigcee, who has brought suit to re
cover the sum of 53S60 paid to the ex
change <>n margins for the purchase
of various stocks.
The case has not yet been assigned for
trial, but that will probably be done
to-morrow. District Attorney Byington
hopes to have the matter before a jury
early" in January, although it is likely
that the defendant will not be called
to court before his term has expired, on
January 7. Mahony declines to state
what his defense will be further than
to asseverate that so long as he is in
office he. will make his subordinates at
tend to their duttes, which is inter
preted to mean that he may claim to
possess a right to "dock" the salaries
of employes who are negligent.
County Clerk Albert B. Mahony Is
under a J5000 bond to answer the
charge of felony. Accompanied by his
mother and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Har
ry Mahony, the indicted official visited
Presiding Superior Judge Murasky's
court yesterday morning, and the two
women were accepted as his sureties in
the bail suggested by District Attorney
Byington. Then the formality of issu
ing an order of arrest and releasing him
was gone through, and Mahony was
in full enjoyment of the personal lib
erty of which he had not been deprived.
The indictment against Mahony was
returned about 5 o'clock Wednesday
afternoon and presented to Judge Mu
rasky, and at the request of the Dis
trict Attorney the Judge fixed the bail
at $5000. But no warrant was issued,
and, if Mahony had known of his in
dictment and had desired to elude its
consequences he had all night to devote
to fulfillment of that desire. When
questioned on this point 'yesterday
Judge Murasky said that if the Dis
trict Attorney had regarded the case as
"one demanding immediate action he
would probably have asked that a
bench warrant be issued and served as
soon as possible; or he might have done
so if he had known that the morning
newspapers were aware of the indict
ment and intended to publish it.
At any rate the County Clerk's slum
bers Wednesday night were not dis
turbed by any one from the Sheriff's
office under instructions to arrest him.
and he says that the first notification
of his indictment was presented to him
in the columns of the first newspaper
he looked at yesterday morning. Then
he rallied his sureties and hastened to
court.

know what to do in your case. Unless
you are charged with a crime, I can't
send you to jail. Suppose you visit the
bond and warrant clerk's office and
ask them to Issue a John Doe warrant
on the charge of being drunk in a pub
lio place. Then hand it to the ser
geant of police downstairs and point
yourself out as the man who is want
ed." Jones, went forth in hir quest,
but the bond and warrant clerk re
fused to iÂ«sue the necessary paper.
Jones fp.i-d in his attempt to break
into jail, but some merciful policeman
may accomplish the end desired before
Christmas has waned.
