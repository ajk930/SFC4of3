SAN FRANCISCO, FRJD^Y; J JULY 31, 1903;
T^OUR fugitives from Folsom Prison zvho thus far Itave succeeded in escaping the bullets of
JP two hundred man-hunters in El Dorado County, are believed now to be perilously located
on-Webber Creek, not very far from the hamlet of Lotus. The pursuing officers, according
to dispatches received early this morning from the scene of the chase for the murderers, feel con
fident that no mistake has been made in the identity of the men who called at farmers' houses on
Webber Creek late yesterday afternoon. The information has been considered of sufficient value
to cause a rapid mustering of all posses and troops at Lotus. The trails and stream were com
pletely guarded by midnight. At daybreak the pursuers will search the region, and if the con
victs be found a terrible battle may result.

a local attorney, brought suit here to
day against Hon. George R. Davis, Judge
of the First Judicial District of Arizona,
for $45,000. Conroy, in his complaint,
charges that Judge Davis unlawfully re
quired him to withdraw from, the United
States mail and deposit In court a letter
containing two valuable notes. This, it is
charged, happened in Arizona in May of
this year. These notes were the subject
matter of litigation then pending in the

notes were In his possession as security
for attorney's fees due from his client.
Beauchamp H. Smith. One of the notes
was for the sum of S3C0O and the other
for $19,196. Conroy put them In a letter
addressed to Los Angeles, out of this

Diplomatic Corps in Caracas Protests
Jointly Against Affront to
Spanish, Consul.
PORT OF SPAIN. Island of Trinidad.
July 30 âPassengers who have just arrived
from Caracas say that in consequence of
the Incident which occurred last Monday
at La Guayra. where, as a result of fric
tion between the Spanish Consul and the
local authorities, the exequatur of the
Consul was withdrawn, the diplomatic
corps at Caracas met and decided to send
a joint note protesting against the action
of the La Guayra authorities and the
withdrawal of the exequatur of the
Spanish Consul.
They took this action. It is sa)d. not for
the purpose of assisting the Spanish claim
before the mixed tribunal, but because of
the precedent which would be established
and because they considered It contrary
to the protocols made with the powers
and signed by Bowen. the United States
Minister, acting as the represenUive of
President Castro. w?
That the convicts are traveling by. night
is positively proved "by the fact that not
a "sign ,"of ; them, has been seen since Mon
day night,", when they released the guards
they "had captured. There are a' number
of ex-convlcts living In El Dorado County
arid: there is no' doubt that they are
throwing v the posses off . the track by
spreading, false reports that the murder
ers have been; seen first at this point and
The old : "robbers' trail," starting from
Clarksville, runs to Mormon Island bridge,
thence to Salmon Falls, Bear Mountain,
Pilot Hill, thence to Greenwood, to
George's Slide, thence to Otter Creek, near
the Â¦ extinct volcano, . thence to Forest
Hill, and crossing the Middle Fork of the
American , River goes ' into the Rubicon
country. , â¢
This trail crosses the wildest country in
thlspart of California. and even the hardy
mountaineers who live around here have
never been over this trail. The ex-convict
who furnished The Call with this inf ot
mation laughs at the probable efforts of
Sheriff Bosquit and Sheriff Keena and
the militia to head off, the escaped des
peradoes. He said that he had watched
the progress of the chase since last Mon
day night and that ' the* band of convicts
could not be caught^ as they knew what
they were about.
EAQEB FEIENDS ASSIST.
. The plot was to ..break from prison and
to take the old "robbers* trail," which
leads from Clarksville and runs to the
Rubicon country In the eastern portion
of El Dorado County. If the convicts
ever reach the Rubicon country they will
probably, not -be caught, for they can hide
there for an indefinite time. The country
abounds with deer and all kinds of game
and fish and in the summer is filled with
cattle that" graze there. In winter the
Rubicon is covered with heavy snow, but
there are plenty * of the cattlemen's cot
tages cabins that would afford shel
ter to. the convicts.
FLAN OF CONSPIRATORS.
â¢It has been learned that the ringleaders
of the band were furnished with
complete information as to the best way
to go to evade capture long before the
break was made.
The movements of the convicts since
last Monday morning seem to prove that
the information given In The Call to-day
is correct even If It does come from the
lips of an ex-convict. To mention this
man's name would mean ,hls death at the
hands of some friend of the escaping
band of murderers who are being hunted
for high and low by the Sheriffs of four
counties and a company of the National
Guard.
who escaped from Folsom prison
last Monday are not trying blindly to
evade the posses and troops that are
pursuing them. The old "robbers* trail"
is the one that the convicts made up their
minds to use when they planned their
murderous break from Folsom.

and Sheriff Bailey of Glenn all
passed through here this even
ing, headed toward Webber

The report that came to this
side was to the effect that the
hotel man at Lotus went out this
afternoon and in the vicinity of
Webber Creek found a camp
where the refugees had taken
breakfast or/ dinner. A farmer
living in that vicinity reported
that four of the convicts called
at his place this morning to get
drinking water. /
Sheriff Bosquit, whose head
quarters have been at Lotus and
who is supposed to be in charge
of operations, has ordered the
militia to the northern end of
Webber Creek. He is guarding
the lower end, and he has sent
out a hurry order for reinforce
ments all along the line. No at
tempt will be made to capture
before daybreak.
Sheriff Keena and the various
f Placer County posses will reach
the seat of operations about mid
night. If this latest report of the
whereabouts of the lawbreakers
be true, there will surely be a

According to this authority It was writ

constitutions and % conclaves, ' esp^plally
that of Pius IX, and then complains of
the condition of the Holy See, "under hos

In the enjoyment v of .VfuH^llberty, and
recommends the maintenance of the^rights
of the Pontiff. It enjoins the election of
a new Pope, not according to the personal
preÂ£erences,i9f the Cardinals, but accord
ing to the dictation of their consciences,
inspired only by the welfare of . the
church. â¢ Â¦ - Â¦'â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦_'" â¢ ; ii / *Â»
During the meeting of the congregation
of the Cardinals to-day the Camerlingo
read an autograph' letter from Emperor
Francis Joseph of Austria, wh'.ch added
renewed condolences on the death of Leo
and expressed the hope that the Sacred
College would be Inspired by the great
Interests of the church in choosing his
successor. The letter produced a strong
impression and It was decided to answer
It with a pnecial message.
OUTLINES THE PROGRAMME.
Subsequently Cardinal Oreglia explained
how the work of the conclave 'was to be
carried on, .recalling tht:, principal rules
which were to govern the body and recom
mending their strict observance. He out
lined a programme for to-morrow, which
.will consist of mass to the Holy Ghost
:in the morning, together with ; the de
liverance of the oration pro pontifico
ellgendo. The Ordinals will enter the
enclave at 5 o'clock In the evening.
"'Each of the Cardinals to-day received
a medal struck by the Camerlingo, to
maintain the tradition of his sovereignty
during the interregnum. It Is Intended
to strike coins also for. all the conclavists
and servants whp are to be present.
Three Cardinals were charged with the
duty visiting the apartments of the
concl%e and two others with Visiting the
of the conclave for 'the purpose
of making sure that there will be no pos
sibility of communication with the outside
( Vforld. They are to make their report to
-ihe' congregation to-morrow. .
i^ The question of the compensation to be
given to the physicians who treated the
late Pontiff during his last illness was
discussed In the congregation. The ex
ecutors of the will . said that the money
'remaining after. the charitable bequests
left by Leo were paid would be only about
$4000. .'This* j sum * was , considered Insuf
ficient and a commission of Cardinals was
instructed to augment it io such an
amount as might seem approbate.
POPE LEO'S BECOMJEENDATIONY
It is said that Count Soderi, whose posi
tion at the Vatican is that of "bearer of
the golden rose," the greatest gift' which
a Pope can confer upon men of royal fam
ily, was entrusted by. Leo with the task
of writing the history of his pontificate,
the Pope enjoining upon him | the fat*
that he wished a true history and not a
eulogy. Count Soderi was supplied with
abundant documents for his work.
The noise was bo great that the colossal
figures of . Michael Angelo's "Lost Judg
ment" seemed almost to show surprise at
.the busy scene which was transforming
the beautiful chapel from a religious to
an almost electoral aspect.. . ' \
Outside the" Vatican the work was of a
different characterâ the quiet work of the
supporters of the several candidates mar
shaling their strength for the . contest
which'is to come when the doors of the
conclave are closed. : '($.''
CARDINALS VISITS THE CELLS.
* The Cardinals to-day visited the cells
which they are to occupy during the con
clave. It cannot be said that they re
turned very enthusiastic over the idea of
being confined, perhaps for some time in
what are ' rightly Â¦_ termed "cells," whiqh
are without running water and necessary
ventilation. It was feared that the health
of some of the older and more feeble
Cardinals might suffer.
To-night experiments were made with
the kitchens, the working of which is con
sidered quite Important, as about 500 per
sons must be fed thrice daily for an in
definite period. The trials were quite suc
cessful. The revolving dumb'waiters also
were tested. They are characteristically
Roman and consist of shelves on which
things are placed and are made to re-
I volve, carrying things, in or ocft^but mak
ing it impossible for persons on either
slde'to see each other. v . : ; i
ROME, Jul^SO.^The Vatican to-day was
the scene of gTeat '"activity, both inside
and outside. In the Vatican preparations
were making for the conclave, and every
thing was in the utmost confusion. Work
men and servants were hurrying hither
and thither, some hanging curtains, oth
ers putting in extra furniture, while por
ters were staggering along under immense
trunks, as if some of the Cardinals ex
pected to remain in their cells for months.
Other Cardinals sent "practically nothing.
In the Sistine chapel work will go on
throughout the night. â The catafalque
erected for the funeral services is being
pulled down, and the galleries which
were built" fcg -the accommodation of
especial personages, are being replaced by
stalls for t the Cardinals." These will be

At Recess, where the King and Queen
stopped for luncheon to-day, an extraor
dinary incident occurred. A hooded wom
an approached the Queen with a petition
for the remission of the remainder of a
f=pntence of fIx months passed upon her
husband. Inquiries proved that the man's
character justified clemency, and the
Queen, with the King's permission, re
mitted the sentence on the spot. The
rurrounding crowd, learning what had
occurred, cheered wildly. '-*
For visiting the famous Connemara
marble quarries near Recess the local au
thorities provided a dilapidated, grimy
landau, with two jaded horses and a
"jarvey" of the usual class. It was
doubted whether their Majesties would
enter such an equipage, but to the de
light of the crowd of peasants and bare
footed women with red petticoats who
Jined the steep, muddy hill, the King,
tmiling at the singularity of the vehicle,
entered it without hesitation, the Queen,
Princess and the Earl of Dudley follow
ing him. .The "jarvey" was somewhat
nervous and the King asked a member
of his suite to mount the box beside him.
In a similar' vehicle were Lady Dudley
and other ladies of the Queen's suite. An
escort of "Connemara cavalry" completed
the procession.
The King and Queen took a train for
Gal way and arrived here late in the af
ternoon. They met with an enthusiastic
reception. The King was presented with
addresses by the District Council and
other bodies, to which he replied briefly,
lie then boarded the royal yacht, which
was lying in Galway Bay.

JKFFERSON CITY, Mo., July 30.â The
case of State Senator William P. Sullivan
of Christian County, charged with having
solicited a bribe of $4300 in connection with
the baking powder legislation at the re
cent session of the Legislature, was called
to-day- before Judge H. C. Timmons of
Barton County. Judge Timmons was spe
cially appointed. because of the allegation
of prejudice of Judge Hazell.
The defense offered a plea in abatement,
setting forth that the defendant was In
dicted illegally because of the appearance'
of the Attorney General In the Grand
Jury room, together with Cosgrove and
Dunlop/ Grand Jury stenographers. After
a brief argument by the attorneys. Judge'
Timmons overruled a motion to sustain
the plea.
Then came a demurrer similar. to those
filed In the Smith and Farris cases. At
torney, Pope for the defense argued the
points of the demurrer at length.
', Judge Timmons overruled the demurrer.
The defendants noted exceptions to all ad
verse rulings preparatory to appealing, in
case of conviction. Judge Timraons; then
reset the case for August 19 owing to the

to that quarter and purchased a quantity
of opium from Chinese living Ahere. Kitt

FOLSOM, July SO.-Chief Clerk Brain
ard F. Smit|i of the State â¢prison to
day in discussing the Chances of
capturing the escaped convicts remarked
that it looks as if it would be a long hunt,
with the refugees having ah the advan
tage on their side at the outset at least.
An officer Just from the front explains
that in the. vicinity 'of Lotus and in the
country round about there are a great
many small mountain ranches and nearly
all of them have fruit orchards and little
garden patches. The convicts by raiding
these at night might be able to get
enough raw fruit and vegetables to sus
tain life for some time, even if they had
not other food supply. In this way they
could^take it easy and .wait for the trail
ers to Â«row weary of the search and
leave the neighborhood, after which the
convicts could make their way out of the
country at their leisure...
The man hunters are very much worn
already because of the strenuous life they
have been leading. It will soon be a ne
cessity for those In command to reduce
the work to a system, as human endur
ance will not stand the strain that some
of the men have been putting on them
selves.

had no .coat/ only a dark vest
and dark trousers. They were
both very nervous and Mrs.
Stronach is positive that the men
belonged to the convict band
from Folsom.
The fellows, according to
Green, weighed between 150 and
J.60 pounds. Each was smooth
shaven, with hair cut .short. One
was about 45 and the other 24

Green was not an officer, the
convicts allowed him to go.

CAMP OF CONVICTS
IS FOUND IN WOODS .
â¢ NEAR TOWN OF LOTUS
INSANE MAN WOULD
EAT BRICK BUILDINGS
AUBURN, July 30.â A late report to
night is that a citizen of Lotus went
out this afternoon and found a camp
where the convicts had been cooking In
the woods two miles, above Lotus. The
same report states that three men called
at a farmer's house In that locality for
drinking water this morning. Officers here
have started for that point.
Fire broke out shortly after 1. o'clock
this morning in the tenement house
at 273 Stevenson street, and be
fore the department arrived on the
scene more than a dozen families had
been left temporarily homeless. Many
men, women and children had narrow es
capes, and several were rescued by the
police.
The fire started In the rear of 273 Ste
venson street, and was caused by the up
setting of a lamp. Before the alarm waa
turned in the flames had spread: to the
adjoining house at 273 Stevenson street,
and for a time it looked as it the entire
block would be destroyed^
An alarm was turned In from box 62
and responses were prompt. The fire
fighters did their work well and" in- fifteen
minutes the flames were" under control
and the remainder of the block was
saved. 7?J ,5
The twelve or more families that occu
pied apartments in the two tenements
had rather a lively experience. Many
were bewildered and ran in a dazed way
through the houses. The policemen ami
firemen went quickly to the rescue, and it
was their prompt action that saved sev
eral lives.
The tenements were both slight frame
structures and in a decayed state. They
were owned by the Hellman syndicate
and were fully covered by insurance. The
loss to the occupants of the places will
be slight, as nothing of much value was
in either of the houses. . â¢Â¦ r ISSpM!
John Martin, an aged fencing teacher,
whose place of employment is at 103
O'Farrell street, was the only on* Injured
fn the fire. He was awakened .by the
noise in. the street and before he could be
rescued his hands and face were badly
scorched by 1 the flames.. He was treated
at the Emergency Hospital.
Cow Starts a Fire.
A cow belonging to W." C." Allen, a
dairyman at Forty-eighth avenue and H
street, started a fire early festerday
morning, which completely destroyed Al

she suddenly upset a lamp. Alien waa

he battered buildings rwith a club and.
picking up fragments: of bricks, tried to
consume them. Then he gathered up an
armful of building material and started
for his room.
Meantime the police at the Harbor sta

to Davis street- When they arrived Short
had barricaded his room, ; arid defied the
policemen to enter. The^door was bat
tered down In short order, and after a
short struggle the demented man was
started in the direction of the hospital.
â¢' In the . room Henneberry and Dowd
found about a dozen bricks, all of which
had beennlbbbled at. Short has been in

acquaintances and these: know but little
concerning him. He will be taken before

he was once surrounded by a detachment

their lines at night and. gathering a force
of Filipinos, captured those who had a

He took the United States soldiers pris

In epeaklng of the incident Miss An
toinette Wilkinson, daughter of the War

It has just been learned that Warden
Wilkinson, immediately after his return
to the prison, upon being released by his
captors last Monday morning, went Inside
the prison and ordered the 800 convicts
back into their cells. Wilkinson was un
armed and entered the prison alone. The
800 convicts were shouting and jeering In
demoniac glee over the successful out
come of the break and when Wilkinson
came among them they surrounded him.
He ordered them to return to their cells.
Some of them obeyed on the Instant, while
others hung back and sulkily sought their
quarters. Several openly expressed their
eatisfactlon at his safa return.
ACT OF THE WARDEN".
The prisoners were given the mid-day
meal in close confinementâ a treatment
which they did not relish. After dinner
they quieted down and made no disturb
ance the rest of the day. They were let
out In Email squads for supper, and this
morning the entire 800 were seated at the
table at once. They made no demonstra
tion whatever and adjourned quietly to
their oells. It will be several days, how
ever, before they are let out to their
work. +> / -;.'.
A te!erhone message has been received
at the prison from the Varden's nephew
Flatting that the posses had four of the
convicts surrounded in Webber Creek and
that he had gone to Auburn for reinforce
ments.
For the first time eince the brfak oc
curred the prisoners were allowed to meet
in the dinig-room of the prison at once
this morning. Since Monday morning
the convicts have been led out into the
dining-room, ninety at a time, for their
meals. Yesterday they were given dinner
in their cells, owing to the fact that they
had been very restless all morning. They
kept up a shouting and yelling and it was
deemed best to keep them in their cells.
After telling the way to different
points the men started toward Placer
ville, but had gone but a short distance
when they turned back and started to
ward Pilot Hill.
This afternoon Guard Scavey telephoned
to the prison and gave the authorities
eome hope that the posses were near the
fugitives and would possibly capture
some of them. Seavey etated that about
19 o'clock last night three men appeared
at the home of Mrs. Stronahe and in

mother at the time. She noticed that one

ing for the murderous convicts. Commu
nications received from Auburn, Butch

much In the dark as to the whereabouts
of the missing convicts as ever.
Some of the posses are inclined to think
that the convicts have doubled back on
their trail, while others think that they
have passed around Georgetown and are
on their way to Lake Tahoe. One thing
is certain: If they are not securing aid
from outside sources they cannot hold out
much longer in the country where they
are now supposed to be.
Deputy Sheriff Timothy B. Hafcerty of

asserts positively that he and others ran
across the escaping convicts about two
miles north of Lotus Wednesday night.
Gray says that over twenty shots were
exchanged.
A party of militia heard some one
crashing through the brush in Black Rock
Canyon, and pursued an unknown man
for several miles on the run, but never
caught sight of him after climbing the
rocks to Greenwood Creek.
Militiamen In camp ldst night .spied an
object moving in the darkness. The call
to halt was not heeded and the outpost
blazed away. The suspicious character
proved to be a hog and was shot full of
holes. With so many men engaged in the
pursuit and working independently it 13
generally feared that there may be a
tragedy resulting from ah unexpected
meeting of posses. Nine men out of ten
could not tell the convicts from the pur
suers.
VOLLEY FOR THE HOG.
A rancher named Jackson met the Swls
ler outfit on the road to Greenwood at 8
a. Â¦ m. and reported that an armed man
had ridden with him for several miles
and had gone into the brush at Penobscot,
a village half way between Cool and
Greenwood. The pursuers found the trail
and followed It for several hours, when it
disappeared in a beaten ''path.
Jerry Porter, who lives on a lonely
ranch three miles from Cool, reported at
noon that three armed men were in his
barn at sundown last night. He thought
they were convicts and did not speak for
fear, and they. said nothing to him, al
though he was only a few feet from
them. Porter left the barn hurriedly,
and the men went through the rear of the
barn and took to the timber. A Sheriffs
posse went in the direction supposed to
have been taken by the convicts.
Shots were heard in Greenwood in the
early morning. More shooting was re
ported from Webber Creek. Tennessee
farm, a chaparral-covered ranch near
Cool, was thought to shelter a band of
convicts, but a thorough patrol resulted
in establishing the fact that the convicts
have been in this neighborhood, and noth

Special Dispatch to The Call
The knives which the ringleaders held
over the officers and free men never came
into their possession until Sunday, Cap
tain Murphy believes. All the cells were
searched Saturday and the convicts had
no weapons about their clothing then.
They were let out for a short time Sun
day and then secured the knives and
razons, which must have been planted
about the prison yard. Murphy said this
could be easily done. Opium had been
secreted in the prison yard and where
opium can be "cached" a knife or razor
can be hidden, he argued. Some of the
convicts were in the quarry Sunday, and
it is possible some of thejm could have
brought the knives into the prison, but
Murphy does not believe .they did. There
were only a few convicts In the quarryâ
the gang known at the prison as the "rig
gers."
Later on the ringleaders would take; the
plot up again, having in the meantime
"weeded out" the other convicts of whom
they were suspicious of having revealed
their plans. Probably the second scheme
would be thwarted, but eventually they
would secure a dozen men who would
"stick" and the break would occur.
The fact that the notorious train robber
and outlaw, "Jack" Brady, who is serv
ing a life sentence from Sacramento
County, was not In the conspiracy has oc
casioned much comment and speculation.
Captain Murphy said the convicts told
him while they were marching him across
the prison farm that they did not want
any "notoriety" men with them and for
that reason had not approached Brady or
any of the convicts who as free men be
came notorious by reason of their mis
deeds. Brady works in the lower yard
gang and had gone to his work when the
mutiny began.
Murphy said that the ringleaders never
contemplated taking the negro, Seavls, or
J. J. Allison, who was killed in the fight
with the posse last Monday night, with
them. They were near the chapel when
the break occurred and as the escapes
swept across the prison yard with the
officers they grasped the situation and
ran to join their fellow, convicts in the
flight for freedom. The escaping convicts
told Soavis they did not want him, but he
insisted upon going along. *
KNIVES WERE CACHED.
METHODS OF PLOTTERS.
In speaking: of thf break Murphy said
to-day that he did not believe more than
two or three men at the most, in addi
tion to those who succeeded in making:
their escape, had a hand in the' plot. He
said that usually a few men would evolve
a scheme of .this, kind and quietly pass
the word along: to a few more. One or
two of the number would be sure to let
the prison authorities know what was
going on. When the ringleaders would
see the officers were on the alert they
would know their secret had been
divulged and they would then temporarily
abandon the plot.

of the arch can be made by your architect.
Tour architect has Informed me verbally that
th* Wight to be Fuspended will materially ex-'
ce<d the above figures. Not alone is this the

from the cable system, must be assumed to
weigh somewhere in the neighborhood of ton

to the ultimate permanent load, may make thÂ«

PORTLAND. Or., July 30.â Sheriff Story
has arrested four men who are charged
with holding ' up and robbing an. electric
qar of the Oregon City line within the
city limits on the night of July 14. The
men are Ira Landers, Arthur Hicks, Earl
Mclntcsh and David Simmons. The Sher
iff has been quietly working on the case
for the last two weeks. .On each of the
men arrested was found some article of
jewelry, which, the Sheriff claims, was
taken from the passengers of the electric
car, and he feels sure that he has tho
right men.
About midnight of July 14 six masked
men boarded an electric car of the Ore
gon City line and shot B. F. Day, then
went through the car and compelled the
thirty passengers to hand over their
money, watches and jewelry. Since' that
time many people have been held up and
fobbed in the city and the Sheriff thinks
he has now broken up the gang, which
has been terrorizing the community. Day,
who has recovered from his wounds,
identified Mclntosh as the leader of the
highwaymen who held up the car.

Webber is a prominent attorney of the
Sonoma County bar and has been elected
to many positions of honor in this city
and county. He has served as City At
torney and District Attorney and stands
high In the councils of the Republican
party in county and State politics. He
has hosts of friends in this city and fur
ther news is anxiously awaited here.
There is telegraphic communication with
Covelo, but nothing could be learned from
that place to-day. The hunters are many
miles from Covelo in the mountains.
SANTA ROSA, July 30.â An alarming
report has been received In this city re
garding the disappearance of ex-District
Attorney Orlow O. Webber. With a party
of friends he had been hunting an South
Eel River, In the extreme northern, por
tion of Mendocino County.- On Monday
night one of Webber's companions came
Into a dance hall at Covelo, where a dance
was in progress, and announced that
Webber had been missing for three days
and that the efforts of his companions to
locate htm had proven unavailing. He re
quested that those present -assist In the
search and twenty young men agreed they
would start in search of the missing man
at daylight Tuesday morning.
The .circumstances surrounding the dis
appearance are simple. Webber rose one
morning and found his mule missing. He
refused to wait for breakfast and started
in pursuit of the beast. He took his gun
with him in order that he might shoot
deer should the opportunity present itself.
His companions believed when he failed
to return the first day that ho had found
the mule and gone on the trail of game.
Night came on and Webber did not re
turn. Finally the mule came into camp
and then the fears of the companions
were aroused. They searched that night
and the two following days in vain and
then decided to call for assistance. Their
camp was located on top of the .range
of mountains near Covelo, at a place
named Signal Point, and the dancers
who agreed to render assistance in finding
the missing man went to that place before
dawn to begin the search. The news
was brought "to this city by a young man
who attended, the dance.
Webber is a very large man, and while
carrying"" much avoirdupois, Is not easily
fatigued. He is troubled with somnol
ence and may possibly have taken a nap
and then missed his way on awaking.
The country in which he is hunting is
one of the roughest in the State and one
in which a man can easily lose his way.
The hillsides are covered with a' heavy
growth of timber and underbrush and
there are innumerable small valleys which
prove deceptive to thV hunter.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Leaves His Camp on South Eel
River and Fails to
Return.
Searching Parties Seek

It is reported that a swindling concern operating

suggest the propriety of the organization of a society

upon them. ='/
VANCOUVER, B. C. July 30.â The
movement in Canada to make voting
compulsory has at last reached the stage
of Parliamentary action. A special from
Ottawa ..states that at the meeting
of the elections commission of the House
to-day it was decided to recommend a
law providing for compulsory voting. Any
qualified elector who fails to vote in any
election will be deprived of ' the right to
vote at the next election.
Voting Made Compulsory.
The local Judge who threw out of court a case
in which a young lady was suing for the value of
kisses bestowed upon a gentleman friend has
worked a hardship on the city. It would not only be
interesting but extremely valuable to know what is
the market price of kisses in San Francisco. They
certainly are worth something. '
LOS ANGELES, July 30.â By a decision
of Judge Oster of San Bernardino Coun
ty the absorption by the University of
Southern California of Chaffey College,
located at Ontario, was illegal, and the
JSO.OOO endowment of the smaller college
must remain the property of that corpor
ation. The decision was rendered in a
suit brought against the trustees of the
University of Southern California by the
original donors of the Chaffey College en
dowment to annul the deed transferring
the Ontario property to the university.

A STRIKING illustration of the contrast be
tween journalism as practiced in the United
States and that which passes for journalism
in Europe is afforded by the apparently well au
thenticated report that the news of the death of
Pope Leo was received in r London, Paris and Berlin
not from Rome but from New York. It appears
that the Associated Press sent out the news from
Rome fully an hour before any other news agency
in that city, and so swift is modern telegraphy that
within that hour the news went to New York and
was sent back to the Old World before the papers of
the great capitals over there received their own
Roman dispatches.
It has been the custom of the journalists of Great
Britain and the Continent to defend their method
of conducting newspapers by saying that what they
lacked in speed as compared with American methods
they more than compensated for by accuracy and by
iullness. No such defense can be made on this oc
casion. Never before in the history of the world
has any current event be^en so fully, so accurately
and so realistically reported as have been the scenes
and incidents attending the death of Leo. From the
hour when the first announcement was made of his
serious illness and that hope of recovery could not
be reasonably entertained, the American press has re
ported events in and around the Vatican with a suf
ficient, amount of detail to enable the reading public
to follow not only the last struggles of the ebbing
life of the venerable Pontiff, but the gossip' of rival
ries and intrigues as well as of the loyalties and the
sorrows of his attendants. Moreover, around the
dispatches from Rome there was given in every im
portant paper in the""' United States a wealth of his
toric information concerning every phase of the event
that could be of any current interest to the public

THE conservative Democrats of Ohio have
taken heart from the Iowa victory over Bryan
and under the banner of Zimmerman of Co
lumbus propose to capture the August convention
and make a platform in which their forgettery will
be better than their memory of the last two national
platforms.
Against this programme fights Tom Johnson, with
the voluble Lentz as his lieutenant. He proposes to
capture the convention by having Bryan there to in
voke the divine ratio and to put in the platform Gov
ernment ownership of everything in which his own
millions are not invested. He will insist also that
the single tax go in and that the right of private
owners be denied. We hope Johnson will win. His
issues are in the air as free silver was from 1878 to
1896. and like it, the way to end them is to bring
them down out of the sky and knock them out by
a campaign of education.

An elephant hunt in Abyssinia has been planned by
a coterie of Wall-street brokers. Recent dispatches
from New York indicate that these self-same brokers
could have all the risk, excitement and desperate
danger they jvant by continuing to trifle with the
bulls and bears of the stock market.
LONG ago we pointed out that the rush for in- j
vestment in trust stocks had in it the elements j
of a stock panic, because investors had been
uiuoctrmated with the idea that in those vast indus
trial organizations there was some conjuring that by
iu2gic lifted them out of the ordinary rules of busi
ness; they were regarded as automatic dividend pay
ers and exempt from financial reverse and misfor
tune.
This idea that they were immune had its antetype
in the mining stock excitement which drove men
wild in this city in the days of the Comstock
bonanza. The undoubted vastness of the mineral
wealth of that great lode started a fever in which
men grabbed at everything in the shape of mining
stock. Almost any stock could get listed on the
board, and those that could not were sold and bought
and speculated in on the curb with an insane vo
racity. In those days it is said that a man went to a
printer to have some stock certificates printed on a
hurry order. The printer askfcd the name of the
mine and his customer answered, "Oh, put in any
name; it makes no difference." In much the same
spirit industrial combinations have been made and
their stocks bought. Now there has come partial
retribution, but the good have suffered with the bad.
Because of this it is said that Mr. J. P. Morgan has
lost prestige, because the steel trust stocks, both pre
ferred and common, fell off with the rest and he
failed to protect then.
Of course there are stories told to account for this
last Black Friday. It is said that Whitney and Har
riman combined to force the slump to avenge them
selves on Keene, and that they were joined by Gould
and Rockefeller in order to include the Pennsylvania
road in the programme of vengeance for President
Cassatt's action in destroying the poles and wires of
the Western Union Telegraph Company on his right
of way. It was said that this reprisal was successful
and that the Pennsylvania stocks were disgorged on
the market by holders, who put them out, for salva
tion purposes on other deals, to such an extent that
Rockefeller and Gould got control of the road and
would compel Cassatt to retire.
But none of these raids on legitimate stocks could
have been made except for the conviction of the
street that the trust industrials are so overwatered
that they are a constant element of danger to the
market. This founds all stock transactions upon a
secret feeling of panic, and holders are ready to
scare and let go at the first sign of trouble. The
flurry may be prolonged quite indefinitely without
affecting legitimate business, because the country is
on a sounder foundation than ever. But at any time
that such a liquidation of watered stocks is concur
rent with bad crops, involving what are known as the
granger railroads in the West, through loss of ton
nage, the cause that underlay this last flurry may well
proceed to a general panic that will bring another
cycle of hard times.
Short of that nobody cares what punishment falls
upon financiers who have been guilty of the over
capitalization of industrial combinations. The les
son should not be lost upon the investing public,
which took those stocks against all prudence and all
warning. But the gambler who loses to-day will
pawn his watch and gamble again to-morrow, and
the buyer of a lottery ticket that draws a blank will
curse his luck but buy again. So it is likely to be
with the investors in paper property, and it will be
a gain to the speculative but unwary public if the
prestige of Morgan and the other engineers of great
combines suffer sufficiently to rob them of the gift
of sorcery which has been ascribed to them.
For the general fund in the State
Treasury to become exhausted is an un
usual occurrence in this State. The
present shortage of money in the general
fund 'is due to the low tax rate during
the last year of ex-Governor Gage's ad
ministration. There should have been
about $1,500,000 more in the general fund
than there was on June 30, 1903, which
would have obviated the necessity for re
course to other funds to enable the State
to run its business.
From the State school land fund, |70O,
000; school land deposit fund, $68,000; State
Library fund, $25,000; estates of deceased
persons fund. $9S,000; dissolved savings
banks fund, $30,000; making the total
amount transferred $921,000. That amount
of money will carry the State along until
probably the middle of November. From

SACRAMENTO. July 30.â The general

to the front as the choice of the Demo
cratic party for Mayor of Sacramento.
Mr. Hassett, although a partner in one
of the largest establishments in the city,
daily works at his calling as an expert
printer, and he enjoys a widespread popu
larity among all classes of citizens.
The local political camp is somewhat
disturbed by the story industriously cir
culated that after all Mayor George H.
Clark may change his mind and run for a
third term as an independent candidate.
With his partner, A. P. Booth, Clark is
now in the East arranging for the trans
fer of his business to San Francisco. But
while Clark has said he is going to en
gage in business in San Francisco, he.
carefully avoided committing himself as
to whether he intends to give up his resi
dence in Sacramento and withdraw from
the contest for further political honors.

HONOLULU, July 24.â When the Young
brothers were out In- one of their launches
cruising about Diamond Head a few days
ago they took soundings at a place which
was marked on the charts at 28 fathoms
and were naturally very much surprised
to find that the lead registered but twenty
fathoms. They began to wonder if some
mistake had not teen made and so started
to cruise over that portion which was set
down on the charts at 23 fathoms. It was
invariably the same thing. The lead kept
showing twenty fathoms or a slight varia
tion. Since the bottom where the sound
ings were taken is sandy the filling in
theory Is untenable, so that the only
theory left is that the bottom of the sea
at the place indicated has been heaved up
eight fathoms toward the surface of the
water bv volcanic action.

among his political enemies, expresses
his belief that Clark may re-enter the
contest the coming fall. If this should
prove true the Democratic and Republi
can candidates will have an interesting
fight on their hands, since Clark has the
administration following with him.
For minor offices there does not seem
much prospect of lively contests. It is
believed that . Captain J. D. Young will
be re-elected City Assessor and J. Ellas
Gavan City Collector. Both are extreme
ly popular. Mr. Gavan has made a splen
did record, and as the position Is one
which demands a high order of ability it
is thought that he will have no trouble to
secure renomination and election.
The unfortunate condition of affairs in
the Second Ward still exists, there being
no representation of that ward in the
Board of Trustees, although Important
measures are constantly coming before
the board for adjustment. Under a cer
tain contingency Mayor Clark would have
the power to appoint a Trustee from that
ward. He has expressed himself as will
ing to appoint any man who may be
agreeable to the residents of the ward.
and it is not Improbable that on his re
turn from the East he will be asked to
take action In the matter.
EVILS OF OVEH-CAPITALIZATION.
SACRAMENTO PUBLISHER WHO OCCUPIES A PROMINENT PLACE IN
POLITICAL. LIFE OF CAPITAL CITY AND IS THE PROBABLE
CHOICE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR MAYOR.
KING EDWARD has met the people of Ireland
and found them as cordial in their welcome
as those of any other part of his dominions.
Despite slight displays of antagonism here and there
the prevailing sentiment has been one of gratification
over the royal visit and of genuine good will to the
King himself. The manifestations of loyalty have
come not only from the land-owners and Unionists,
but from the peasants of the country and the toilers
of the cities, end it now seems the tour will be re
corded among the most successful in the history' of
the royalty of our time. â¢
There are of course many reasons for the cordial
welcome given the King wherever he has been since
he landed on the Irish shores. In the first place,
hospitality and good humor are characteristics of the
Irish race. They fight hard, but they do not bear
malice. Even among those who in times past have
been loudest 'in denouncing the King as the repre
sentative of British tyranny there are doubtless many
who on the King's arrival joined readily enough
with the throngs that were making the skies ring
with their applauding shouts. Then, too, there is
to be taken into consideration the innate love of
mankind for any kind of a show, and .particularly for
a royal show. That feeling was manifest in a most
remarkable way when Prince Henry of Prussia came
to this country- No one here felt any loyalty to him
nor any particular admiration for him, but none the
less he was greeted by bigger and more enthusiastic
crowds than ever greeted an American President.
The fact that he. was at once a novelty, a royalty and
a free show gave him a prestige in the American
mind that generated a real enthusiasm wherever he
went.
Edward has had in Ireland all of those common
feelings on his side to help him in his efforts to win
the affections of the Irish people, but it would be un
fair to attribute all the enthusiasm of his welcome to
those feelings alone. He has made his tour at a most
propitious time. The Irish land bill has been passed
on the third reading in the Commons by a vote of
317 to 20, and it seems a foregone conclusion that
the Lords will malce no- attempt to defeat it or to
seriously alter it. The bill is regarded with favor by
nearly all classes of the Irish people and hence they
â¢are irt a great good humor with the Government and
the outlook. Of course the King .has profited by
that feeling and it is an evidence of his political
sagacity that he was prompt to visit Ireland while
the bill is before the country and every one is
pleased.
Finally, a good portion of the welcome must be
attributed to the personality of the King himself. It
! has been said of Edward that he has more personal
friends than any other man in the world. Americans
who have met him have confirmed the reports of his
tact and geniality in meeting men, either in masses
or in private interviews. In his youth he was known
as a "thorough good fellow." He has now ripened
and rounded into a most courteous and agreeable
gentleman. He has the faculty of pleasing nearly all
kinds of people and has shown it recently in Portugal,
Italy and France as well as in his present tour. Im
mediately on his arrival in Dublin he took the first
opportunity to dismiss the guards that were ap
pointed to attend him, saying "I have no need for
them. The Irish people- will take care of me." That
was the way he began his tour and of course it is not
surprising that Ireland has responded.

We do not believe there Is any law in th^
United States that permits the Secretary of
the Treasury to use such high-banded meas
ures, and trust that the Secretary has made a
mistake by betne misled by some overzealous
custom-hcuse official.
The petition is as follows:
We, the undersigned, per steamship Siberia,
from Chins, and Japan for Ban Francisco, vi*
Honolulu, would th&nk you to Inform the pub-
He of the latest and most atrocious outra?*
ever perpetrated on the passengers and under
the instructions of the Secretary of the Trea--
The Siberia called at Honolula to dl'schaxga
some cargo, land a few passengers and receive
passengers for San Francisco. As soon as thÂ»
health officers came on board a squad of Cus
tom-house officers followed, and. with the ex
ception of three or four, they looked and acte-i
like a lot of Jackals. , - -
The passengers from China. Japan and the
Philippines were ordered to get their baggage
ready for inspection, although bound for San
Francisco, and still six days to sail for that
were also notified that what baggase
they had In the baggage-room could not be
touched and all would be sealed In tha hold.
In fact. It was simply seised!
The baggage In the rooms wu examined and
the owners were dictated to as to how many
shirts, collars, etc., they could retain. All the
rest must be bundled up and sent to the hold
and sealed up. One gentleman, who had llvwi
for several years in Japan, had six suits of
pajamas The custom officers said. "You can
only have one," and bundled the remaining
suits into the hold. This was only one in
stance. The clothing was taken, from the
rooms and was rolled up and tied In any fash-
Ion â some in paper, some In nothing â and now
lies in the lower hold: no receipt given for it.
What condition it will be returned In can be
Imagined. â¢ '
Â¦ Men and women who have been living and
traveling In a tropical climate and were clothed
In duck and flannels had their heavy clothlns
sealed up. and many serious cases of sicknesa
are sure to arise before landing in San Fran
cisco.
Lieutenant Kitchener of the British
navy and a nephew of the famous Sirdar
signed the protest, but in speaking of the
matter yesterday he said:
1 want to ear on* thins about that protest.
I signed It, and I think we have & Jim griev
ance. ThÂ« chap that wrote It. however, went a.
little too far whea hÂ« called those Honolulu
Inspector* JackaU. They were nothing of the
sort. The Impression they made en mÂ» waa of
a Â»et of rery good fellow*, who realized as
much as we did the absurdity of tS!a new law.
which their duty, however, corapelled them to
carry out. Please strike out the Jackal as far
as I am concerned.
If the passengers that arrived on the
Ventura were indignant at the new
method of administering the United
States customs at Honolulu, those that
reached here yesterday on the Siberia
were boiling over with wrath. Such an
Impreaslon did Â«>Â« Treasury Department 1 s
latest rule make that a petition of pro
test, addressed to the world at large, was
prepared and signed by all on board.
Among the signers were travelers of all
degrees-globetrotters of many national
ities, distinguished members of the Unit
ed States and foreign land and sea mili
tary service*, high officials of this and
other Governments, and local residents
returning from holiday tours- in the Ori
ent.
Apart from the fact that the- new regu
lation curtails the traveler's visit to
Honolulu, it also works a serious physical
hardship. The trunks containing the
warm clothing necessary here and for
several days before reaching this port are
sealed up at Honolulu. The passengers
have the option while there and before
the seals are affixed of taking out a sup
ply of heavy wearing apparel. The Si
beria is a Urge vessel, but the staterooms
are no more commodious than usual, and
when three people share one room the
fewer clothes they have the better for
everybody's comfort. The weather at
Honolulu Is too warm for the immediate
transfer from duck and flannel to tweedj
and serges, so the passenger has the
choice of retaining his comfortable
clothes and littering his room with winter
wear for use later on; of changing at
once to heavy garb and sweltering for the
sake of future comfort, or of retaining
his light clothes, leaving his warmer suits
in the Â¦ sealed up trunks and taking a
chance with pneumonia as the liner neara
the coast.
Total in foreign vessels $44,386,000,000
It is of course impossible to fix accurately the
amount of freight paid on imports and exports dur
ing that long period of time, but it is evident that the ,
sums paid as a tribute to foreign â¢ ship-owners
for â¢ carrying goods valued at above $44,000,
000,000 must have been enormous. In other 'Â¦
words, we have been paying tribute on a for
eign commerce amounting to more than $1,000,
000,000 annually for the last forty-three years,
and as our foreign commerce is rapidly increasing it
is clear the tribute will be larger in the future than
in the past unless something be done to check it.
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that in ad
dition to the direct tribute paid for freight rates
there is a large indirect loss resulting from being
dependent upon foreign ship-owners in seeking new
markets for American goods. A well organized
ocean steamship company is something more than
a carrier of freight. It helps to open new markets
for its home patrons, knowing very well that an in
crease of trade for them will mean an increase of
traffic for itself. Hence an extensive ocean marine
helps to develop trade as well as to carry it on. It is
believed by those who are familiar with the conditions
of South American trade that the reason why we ob
tain such an inadequate percentage of the foreign
trade of the countries of that continent is that we
have no shipping of our own to compete there with
the lines from European nations. We thus not only
have to pay heavily for all commerce we obtain
through the foreign ships, but we lose a great deal
that would come to us if we had ships of our own.
Another bad feature of the present situation was
disclosed during the war in South Africa, when a
considerable number of British steamers were with
drawn from trade with America to act as transports
j for the army. At that time not only did ocean rates
I between the United States and Europe advance and
thus impose a tax upon our commerce and indi
rectly upon our industries, but in some cases it was
found difficult to obtain shipping when needed. Sev
eral times during the war complaints were heard from
I Boston, Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia of
a lack of transportation facilities across the ocean.
In that way, then, we suffered a double loss, and
should any of the nations whose' merchant marine
is extensively employed in carrying our ocean com
merce become engaged in another war we should of
course have to suffer a similar loss.
The argument drawn from those facts is by no
means the only one in favor of building up our ocean
going merchant marine, but even if taken, alone it
is sufficient to justify action on the part of Congress.
We have become the greatest 'commercial nation on
the globe, and our supremacy will increase with the
years. It is for Congress to say whether our im
ports and exports will be made to pay tribute to for
eigners or whether we shall have ships of our own
and pay tribute to none.
Total in American vessels $11,640,000,000
Imports in foreign vessels $18,722,000,000
Exports in foreign vessels 25.6$4,000,000
ONE of the strongest and most familiar argu
ments in favor of the enactment of legislation
to promote American shipping on the high
seas. is based upon the heavy tribute paid by Ameri
can industry to foreign ship-owners in the way of
freight rates on imports and exports. It is an ar
gument of indisputable validity, for the annual pay
ment of such tribute cannot be denied, biit attempts
have been made to weaken it by denying that the
amount of money thus expended is sufficiently large
to constitute a serious drain iipon our income. It
has not been found possible to calculate exactly the
real expenditure for freights, and as a consequence
there has been more or less skepticism concerning
the estimates of those who fix the sum at a total
large enough to make the argument impressive.
Such being the case, considerable interest at
taches to a new estimate made by W. J. Ballard for
the New York Financial News, and based upon a
careful review of our foreign trade by decades from
i860 to 1900 and for the years 1901 and 1902. The
figures thus obtained confirm the statements of
other experts who have calculated the drain to
amount to many millions a month. A summary of
Mr. Ballard's figures for imports and exports in
American ships as compared with shipments in for
eign vessels during the whole period of forty-three
years is stated in tabular form thus:
Imports in American vessels $6,369,000,000
Exports in American vessels 5,271.030,000

journalism is not among them. It is to be noted
that in the report of Leo's death there was no ques
tion of making what is called a "scoop." It was a
plain case of reporting a piece of news that every
body had been expecting for more than a week.
Therefore, when' London, Paris and Berlin received
the news of the death from New York instead of di

grate to Canada as to bring Canada to this country.

The residence of Thomas Rennlllson,
2412 Harrison street, was entered on Mon
day afternoon during the absence of the
family in the country. Entrance was ef
fected through a rear window. On the
return of the family the burglary was dis
covered and it was found that a lady's
gold watch and neck chain, a ruby ring,
a . diamond collar-button and six silver
bangles, valued at $71, had been stolen.
The police were notified and Detectives
Graham and Fitzgerald were detailed on
the case. After making an investigation
they found that the burglary had been
committed by children from 5 to 6 years
of age living in the neighborhood. The
gold watch was discovered in the door
way of a house and the parents of the
children implicated promised to see that
the other articles stolen were returned to
the owners. Owing to the extreme youth
of the children no action was taken
against them.

The Attorney General, in answer to. a
communication received June 17 from the
State Board of Equalization, asking for
advice as to whether the State Board of
Equalization or the Assessors of the city
and county of San Francisco and the
county of San Mateo had the authority
to assess tho lines now owned and ope
rated by the United Railroads, made an
swer yesterday through a communication
addressed to the State Board of Equali
sation, in which he advises that the
Board of Equalization assess all the rail
ways known as the United Railroads.
In answering the question the Attorney
General refers to a decision of the Su
preme Court that, under the provisions of
section 10 of article 13 of the constitution
of the State of California, the power to
assess the San Francisco and San Mateo
Electric Railroad Company was vested In
the State Board of Equalization. Justice
Henshaw, writing the opinion, bases the
decision on the meaning of the word
"railroads," as contained in that clause
of the constitution referred to. He refers
to the constitutional debates and quotes
extensively from those debates for the
purpose of showing that it was the inten
tion of the framers of the present consti
tution to provide that "where a railroad
was operated in but one county the As
sessor of that county was as competent
to fix the value as he was that of any
other property within his territory; that
there was an essential difference between
ralfroads so operated and those which
traversed two or more counties of the
State."
The Attorney General, In his communi
cation, also stated:
If the assessment of the United Railroads of
Ean Francisco he made only by the local As
sessor and It should later be determined by
the courts that such assessment is invalid,
serious results and losses to the city and State
must follow. If, however, an assessment be
made by both the local authorities and your
board, the legal rights of both the State and
the city will be saved. The local Assessor has,
I am Informed, made this assessment, and it
must be admitted that under the recent de
cision of the Supreme Court there Is grave
doubt whether this assessment will be held
valid. I therefore advise that the State Board
of Equalization assess all of the railways
known as the United Railroads, as the failure
to make such an assessment would seriously
endanger the Interests of the State and of the
city and county of San Francisco.

ON ASSESSMENT
CHICAGO. July 30.â While excavating in
Forest Home Cemetery, this city, to-day work
men uncovered the graves of 'five Indians.
From ornaments, utensils and weapons found it
Is thought the bones are those of chiefs or per
sons who were of some Importance in the.In
dian tribe*.
There was filed and recorded during the
year a total <cf 33,112 documents, an increase
of C870 o\-er the preceding fiscal year. The
large number of building; contracts is a healthy
siÂ«-n of the city's growth, there being a total
for the year of 1451. as against 1250 for the
preceding year. The latter months of the year
just closed show a substantial Increase In the
number of contracts filed, and this Indicates*
for a certainty a great degree of activity In
the construction of new buildings in the city
for months to come.
Tne caÂ«b receipts for the year amounted to
$54,077 70. being an Increase of JsVS.S 10 over
thÂ» total for 1901-C2. The receipts for the year
were, of course, much, in fexcess of the re- ,
ceipts of any year since the present schedule
of fees has been In force. The total expenses
of the department for the year, amounted to
413,000. leaving a net profit of 111,077 70.
Recorder Godchaux filed his annual re
port with Mayor Schmitz yesterday. -The

The Auditor thereupon signed the de
mands of all the employes whose salaries
had been raised.
Hon. K. E. Schmitz. Mayor City and County
of Sa.n Franciscoâ Dear Sir: Your communi
cation of the V.nti lnet. relative to the salaries
recently fixed for employes of the Board of
Public Works and the Board of Health came
duly to hand and received my careful con
sideration. ThÂ« section* of the charter to
which you refer vert the authority to fix sala
ries In the respective boards. The boards are
directed to fix them on the. basis of similar
services In private Institutions. This is a
direction to these boards and rives them the
determination of tbeee questions, and not me.
The boards b&ve acted on matters strictly with.
In then- jurisdiction. I don't think I have
any authority to review their action. If they
ha,vÂ« acted beyond their power it is your duty
to proceed againn tfc%n and compel them to
corrert their mistakes. Respectfully yours,
HARRY BAEHR. Auditor.
Auditor Baehr sent the following com
munication yesterday, to Mayor Schmitz
in reply to the latter's protest against
paying the Increased salaries of certain
employes fixed by the Boards of- Heaiih
and Public Works:
July 30. 1903.
Auditor Baehr Informs Mayor
Schmitz That Charter Gives Them
the Necessary Power.
SAYS TWO BOARDS HAVE
BIGHT TO RAISE SALARIES
The committee postponed action for
two weeks on the petition of business
colleges that their pupils be granted the
half fare privilege, advising the petition
ers to take the matter up with the United
Railroads. /
"The company still insists on its rights
to maintain the Mission tracks," said
Burke. "A proposition may be made to
operate the road by electricity, as Mr.
Herrin still believes that an agreement
may be reached to that effect. I suggest
that the matter be left open for the pres
ent in tho possibility of some agreement
being reached."
"As soon as we know whether or not the
board intends to grant the privilege for
tracks along Islals Creek," Bald City En
gineer Grunsky, "we can act on the ques
tion of certain grade changes. Until a
resolution of intention is passed I cannot
make estimates of damages."
Burke said that Herrin had agreed that
Grunsky shall fix the damages due to
Rrado changes, these to be paid by the
company.
Julius Kahn, representing the fruit
peddlers, made application that an or
dinance be passed whereby they may con
tinue to operate their business on public
streets. J. H. Creely held that the board
had no right to grant permanent en
croachments, and Kahn's application was
denied. *
The offer- of Charles L. Patton to sell
land required for opening of East Park
and Richland avenues for the sum of
$1500 was ac6epted.
During the discussion the committee
expressed Itself again against recom
mending under any conditions the contin
uance of the tracks in the Mission dis
trict, even if the residents of the Mission
should petition the board to retain the
tracks provided the station Â¦ at Twenty
fifth and Valencia streets should be re
opened.
The Supervisors' Street Committee
again postponed action yesterday until
September 3, 1903, on the application of
the Southern Pacific Company for a fran
chise along the bay shore. Jere T. Burke
renewed his request for a continuance
which he had made at the last meeting,
but the committee made a proviso that if
it be deemed expedient the matter wouM
be taken up bfefore the time set, after due
notice to the railroad officials.

The letter of transmittal to the Mayor
Figned by M. J. Casey as president of the
board scores his Honor for preventing the
publication of the monthly bulletin.
The Health Officer reports that 32S6 im
mature calves were condemned, and 16,424
inspections and 2260 abatements of nuis
ances were made. He calls attention to
the inconvenience and positive injury re
sulting from the suppression of the
monthly bulletin of the Health Depart
ment by the Mayor, and urges that means
be found to secure the publication of the
journal, and, If necessary, that legal
messages be adopted.
There were 1GS2 admissions to the Aims
house and S45 discharges. The total ex
penditures â¢ were $84,711 29. The amount
expended for maintenance of the City and
County Hospital was $104,999 92, leaving an
unexpended balance of 8 cents in the ap
propriation.
The annual report of the Board of
Health was filed with Mayor Schmitz yes
terday, and it contains elaborate details
of the work of the various departments
during the fiscal year just ended. The
report calls attention to the splendid ad
ministrations of the City and County Hos
pital and the Almshouse. The suggestion
is made that legislation be enacted to
compel childreji to support, their parents
to relieve congested attendance at the
Almshouse.
Scores Mayor Schmitz for Suppress

Later Policeman CulHnan arrested Dan
le! Lawlor at 18 Heron street on suspicion.
Markman picked out Lawfor from half a
dozen men at the City Prison as one of
the men who had robbed him, and swore
to a complaint before Police Judge Ca
baniss charging Lawlor with the crime.
Lawlor has a bad record. On July 5, 1882;
September 2, 1S85, and January 3, 1S87, he
was sent to the Industrial School, twice
for petty larceny and once for burglary;
January 20, 1890, he was sent to the House
of Correction for thirty days for petty
larceny; January 16, 1891, he was sent to
the County Jail for six months for petty
larceny, reduced from grand larceny. On
May 21, 1895, he was held to answer for
robbery, but on October 2 was acquitted
In the Superior Court. Lawlor was re
leased yesterday afternoon on $1000 bonds.
He denies the charge.
Charles Markman, a cement worker, liv
ing at 333 Thirteenth street, reported to
Policeman Guest early yesterday morning
that he had been robbed by two men on
Mission street, between Eighth and Ninth
streets. He said he had been in a sa
loon at Eighth and Mission streets in the
company of the two men, and after leav
ing tlje Saloon they robbed him of a silver
watch and 514 In coin.
While talking to the policeman D. W.
Kilday passed, and Markman pointed to
him and said he was one of the men who
robbed him. Kilday was taken to the sa
loon, but the bartender said he had not
been there that night. Guest searched
Kilday. but found nothing on him, and he
did not feel justified in placing him un
der arrest.
Charles Markman Identifies Daniel
Lawlor as One of the Al
leged Footpads.
SAYS HE WAS ROBBED, *

"The Vinegar Buyer" at the Columbia
Theater next Monday night.
The missing member of the cast is W.
E. Bonnie, who Is coming across the
country as fast as the Limited can bring
him, and he will arrive Sunday morning.
Owing to the illness of one of the mem
bers of the cast Llebler & Co. found it
necessary to quickly nil the place and se
lected Mr. Bonnie. This actor will be re
membered for his magnificent portrayals
of the King In Viola Allen's production of.
"In the Palace of the King," and as Nero
in the big production of "Quo Vadis." He
has a. copy of the part and will be able to
have sufficient rehearsals after his arrival
here to be In form for Monday's perform
ance. The telegraphic report that Ken

night is, therefore, an error.
RZRA KENDALL and his com

day Night.
The board awarded the contract for
heating- and ventilating the Noe Valley
School building to R. Dalzell Jr. for $5779.
"This matter is important," said
Schmitz, who. was laboring under sup
pressed excitement. "These men have
been removed for no cause, unless it be
political, and I as Superintendent of
Buildings demand of this department to
know the reason for their removal. The
board established a precedent when I re
moved R. H. Campbell from his position
as elevator conductor at the Hall of Jus
tice that no employe of the department
shall be removed without a trial and for
cause. I insist, Mr. Casey, that you re
main to take this matter up."
"Well, I have no time to consider the
matter now," said Casey, who appeared to
be anxious to get away from prospective
hostilities. Casey then left the meeting.
After Casey had left Schmitz turned to
Manson and asked that the removal of
the men be reconsidered, but Manson,
who has formed an alliance with Casey,
said he knew nothing about it, not having
bren consulted by Casey. Schmitz, who
realized that he was helpless, said:
"Well. I want to say that I will instruct
these men to continue in their positions
and to refuse to submit their resignations.
The president of this board assumes ar
bitrary powers when he takes it upon
himself to remove employes on his own
account. He is acting like a Czar. He is
a usurper and a tyrant, and I do not pro
pose to stand for it. These men must be
given a hearing or I will know the reason
why, even if it is necessary to sue out a
writ of Injunction."
Manson declined to consider the ques
tion in Casey's absence, and the meeting
Â¦was adjourned.
Later Schmita sent a letter to the four
men whom Casey had removed, stating
that the notice requesting their resigna
tion was unauthorized and without the of
ficial sanction . of the Board of Works.
Schmitz further said that as one of the
members of the board he declined to par
ticipate In an act of injustice, and advised
that until further notice, and at least
j after a fair hearing, the men should dis
j repard Its provisions.
Commissioners Casey and Schmitz again
locked horns yesterday at v a meeting of
the Board of Public "Works over the re
moval of John Murphy and J. P. Magee,
engineers at the Hall of Justice; W. M.
Jones, engineer at the Fourth Btreet
bridge, and P. M. Duffy, elevator con
ductor at the Hall of Justice, all of whom
are appointees of the Mayor. Letters had
been sent Wednesday to the men 'named
stating that by order of President Casey
their services wouJd no longer be required
after 5 p. m. July 31, and calling on them
to send their resignations by return mail.
At the close of the meeting Schmitz
drew from his pocket the letters sent to
the men, saying that he desired the mat
ter to be considered. Casey said the
meeting had been called for a special pur
pose, to award a bid.
Patrick O'Connell, superintendent of
horses of the San Francisco Fire De
partment, has been suspended from duty
pending an investigation into charges of
his alleged violation of the rules and reg
ulations of the department. The suspen
sion la the outcome of the efforts of Com
missioner J. S. Parry to revenge himself
on the superintendent because he gave
important testimony against him on the
occasion when the Commissioner was un
der fire for selling a colt.
O'Connell has occupied the position for
the last three years and during that time,
he says, no complaint has ever before
been made against him. He says he has
given close attention to his work, and
points with pride to the appearance of
.the corporation yard, over which he is
superintendent.
Unfortunately for O'Connell, he incurred
the enmity of Commissioner Parry by
testifying that he received an order from
him to. turn over a colt to William S. Scott.
He testified before the Mayor that he had
received the order in the afternoon, but
later corrected his testimony before the
Grand Jury by saying he got it in the
morning. Ever since that time Parry has
been O'Connell's Nemesis. He has tried
to have him removed from S the position
be now holds and has partly succeeded.
O'Connell, however, does not Intend to
sit Idly by and have his bread and butter
taken from him. Through his attorney,
D. C. Murphy, he has secured an injunc
tion from the Superior Court preventing
the Commissioners from removing him.
This injunction will come up on Monday
for hearing before Judge Murasky.
He was also ordered to appear before
the Board of Fire Commissioners this
morning to show cause why he should not
be transferred from the position of su
perintendent of horses to active duty. He
filed a petition for an injunction and
Judge Murasky ordered the Commission
ers to appear before him on Monday.
In the meantime O'Connell, on the ad
vice of his attorney, has declined to va
cate the cottage he occupies next to the
building used for housing the horses. He
says he will not give up the fight until
the court has settled the matter. He
thinks the proceedings are unjust and he
believes the whole affair is a scheme to
oust him in order that Parry may install
some henchman in his place.
Following Is a copy of the letter handed
him yesterday by Assistant Chief Dough
erty:
Patrick O'Connell, Superintendent Horses, S.
F. F. D. â Sir: You are hereby notified that
you have been this day suspended from further
duty In this department, pending an Investiga

HARBI1T , SPRINGS July 30.â Instead
of the jprojec^ed boxing matinee between
James J. Jeffries anfiÂ® Robert Fitzsim-/
raous, which' was the headliner for^
Â¦\Vednesday, there was absolutely nothing
doing in the t mining camp. The weather
was Intensely warm, the huroÂ£3!ty causing
it to be almost suffocating^Pso after a
walk tÂ« Middletown and a jog home Jef
fries concluded â¢ iie would not fight the
therrhdmeter. He, spent the balance of
the -day assisting Proprietor Jln'iSflayes
in Staking repairs to a rifle.
Trainer Billy Delaney had a -stack of
mail to ansvCer that Would have stag
gered President Roosevelt, and Is think
Ing seriously of advertising for .a sten
ographer. However, each letter is usually
written In the same strain, which makes
the task a comparatively easy one.
Secretary "Kid" Egan, who juit at pres
ent is on cordial terms with himself and
everybody else but the champj^ owing
to a. slight disagreement the csbser day,
took part In an Impromptu croquet tour
nament. "Brother Jack" Jeffries busied
himself reading iÂ» Copy of one of Laura
Jean Llbby's latest works, while Joe Ken
nedy lazily- swung to and fro In a ham
mock under a shtwling bamboo tree.
Bob Fitzslmmons, with his Jeffries en
gagement off, tripped down to the music
room, where he spent most of, the after
noon' practicing a left-handed w*Jo on the
piano written in a foreign key. Since his
magriage with MlBn.Glfford* the Austra
lian is developing a marked taste for
music, and- may: yet' uftiine as a star of the
comic opera vorld.
DJtk Adams, who is . the life of the
camp, was quiet; all -day; but Is expected
to break out again to-morrow.
.' As to the ultimate outcome rÂ£ his little
engagement- on August 14 with* Jim Cor
j bett, the Los Angeles bollermaker can ap
parently realize but one result, and is
busying - himself more now over a .deer
hunt to take place on Sunday next than
he..ls over the big fight. "The coming con
test may also mark the last appearance In,
the ring; of Jeffries. In the course of a
conversation to-day Trainer Bityy Dclaney
said that the big fallow wants to go in
strictly for fighting during the next three
or four months, and Is willing to meet
the best the world can produce, one after
another. Falling to find any gaine, De
laney Intimated that the champion might
return to his home In gouthern California,
quitting the ring for good. Jeffries V1U
never be a JPierpont Morgan,' for right
now he would rather go off on a deer or
bear' hunt with , a 'couple . of good fellows'
than spar three or four short/"' rounds
nlgh'dy at -some variety theater- for la
weekly stipend of $1000.- Jeffries still, has'
his, cold' bottle for 'dinner, but It is with
the .sanction of Tfalner Desaney. .-.' No
doubt It was this Infraction of the set
rules of training which set the dissipation
stories afloati Delaney Inferred, how

SUMMARY.
Stolen bases â Ross, Spies. Error* â Lohman.
O'Hara. Two-base hits â Murdock, Dillon
Sacrifice hits â Wheeler. Francks, Cravath.
First base on errors â Los Angeles 1. Flrat
base on called balls â Oft Cooper 1. oft Newton
2. Left on bases â Oakland 4. Los Amreles 4.
Struck out â By Cooper 3, by Newton ft. Hit
by pitcher â Baxter. Hoy. Double play â
Francks to Baxter to Messerly. Tlma of game
â 1 hour and 43 minutes. Umpire â O'Connell.
In the saventh Moskiman caught Wheel
er's long fly and made a perfect throw
right on a line to the plate. Lohman ran
upon the ball anr\ it bounded away from
him, allowing Ross to score, when he
should have been doubled up easily. The
score:
The Angels were never worried to any
extent with the southern swings of Coop
er. Whenever they needed runs they gen
erally got them. Cooper in the main
pitched good ball and was well supported,
but as no man on the team was able to
locate the shoots of Newton they had no
chance of victory.
The Arcols fieidcd faultlessly and Â«nt
an error was committed by any of their
number. Buck Francks and Moskiman
were the stars in the Cripple bunch, each
getting some drives that looked like hits.
The game was simply pastime for the
Leaders und, as on the previous occasion,
the Cripples showed they did not have a
chance against the southerners or any
other fast team. Their weakness yester
day was inability to hit the ball at any
stage of the game, and light hitting never
wint ball games.
Dr. Newton was the cause of all their
troubles. They could not find his twisters
except in the "first inning, when Murdock
lined out a lucky double to the score
L'jard. This brought O'Hara in from sec
ond and saved a whitewash being regis
tered against Peter. Of the three hits
made off the bewildering delivery of the
medical southpaw, ilurdock has two to
his credit. Mosklman rapped out the
other one.
It did not take the Angels Ions to make
runs enough to w in half a dozen game*
from the Cripples yesterday at Recreation
Park. Two would have done the tarn,
but to make sure the Angels kept ham
mering away every inning or so and piled 1
up a total of six, while the Cripples bare
ly nosed one man around the paths.

JAMAICA RACETRACK. July SO.â The
principal event on the card to-day was
the Clarendon, handicap and was won by
Astarita, but Hicks had to keep busy in
order to beat Illyria. The latter got two
lengths the better of the start, but before
they had gone an eighth Astarita caught
him". From there to the finish IKyrla raced
close to Astarita and she beat Daly's
colt only half a length. Frank Farre'l had
two starters in the event, but King Pep

George McAllister, conductor on the car
held up on July 15, to-day identified
Blazer as the robber. Other victims will
visit him In jail to-morrow.
, A love affair Is said to have caused the
downfall of Blazer. He was formerly a
minister In the Methodist church. He
traveled, as an evangelist along the Pa
cific Coast and throughout the West.
While pastor of a church In Illinois he
became involved Â¦ with Â¦ a woman In hi3
congregation. A scandal grew from the
affair and Blazer left hurriedly. He was
later unchurched. Then, it is said, he
plunged into extremes of dissipation.
Finally he enlisted 5n the regular army.
He served with the Twelfth Infantry, and
in the Philippines committed many deeds
of daring in the face of the enemy, but
he gained a reputation also for insubor
dination. It is said . that he got .into
trouble while the. regiment was at the
Presidio on the way back from the Phil
ippines, and he had a long guardhouse
record during the period of his service.
It is related of Blazer that in the Phil
ippines at one time he was cut" off by a
party of Ladrones. Although he was
alone, he charged straight for the Fili
pinos, killed or wounded five of the party
of nine and frightened the others . into
flight, escaping with a very slight wound.
His arrest in Salt Lake was due to in
formation given the police by one of the
officers at Fort Douglass, where the regi
ment is now stationed. It was this officer
who revealed the story of Blazer's past
life. 74S88BS&ffiSSÂ£82m ' i
SALT LAKE, July 3O.-Salt Lake's no
torious highwayman was to-day Identified
as a former minister of the gospel. He

but it is said that It Is not his true name.
Blazer Is being held on the charge that
he held up a street car on July 15. In
the previous week another car was held
up in a similar manner, and it is believed
the same man committed bpth crimes. On
both occasions a masked man entered the
car at the end of the line, leveled a re

MEMORY OF . WORLD-FAMOUS
INVENTOR TO BE HONORED
I Yesterday a gang of workmen engaged
â¢ in excavating for the foundation of the
new Merchants' Exchange building at
Leldesdorff and Sacramento streets dis
covered the skeleton of an adult human
being. .
Beneath the dust and trampllngs of a
long and busy generation the remains
still crouched, as If death had come while
the victim knelt, and the skull bore the
; marks of two bullets that possibly ended
: the life of a pioneer soon after the Argo
nauts began to people old Yerba Buena.
Circumstances indicate that the body
went to Its resting place more than forty
years ago. Save for the corroding touch
of time the bones have doubtless lain un
disturbed during a long generation,
though the building now under way will
be the third erected on the site that
marks the grave of some unfortunate
whose death may have been a tragedy.
t The first building on the site was a
T>ank, built more than fifty years ago.
Then, some ten years later. It was
torn down. The old Merchants' Exchange
building was Its successor. The Exchange
stood for morn than forty years, and a
few months ago It was torn down to be
replaced by the building now under, con
struction.
It Is strange that the workmen on the
two former buildings did not discover the
skeleton, for surely it â¢ was there before
either structure .was built.
Hard by the rkeleton the workmen
found a large number of quaint sand cru
cibles of the pattern manufactured in
Holland fifty years ago and used In Cali
fornia at that timp. \ â¢.
When yesterday's discovery '..was- made
the -*orkmen began a careful search of
the vicinity. Nothing further was found
and not a trinket was discovered that
might shed light on the mystery
Those who saw the skeleton think the
man waa murdered. The fact that there
are two bullet holes In the skull, either. of
wnich would have caused death, would
seem to preclude a theory of suicide. â¢
Who the man was orwha his murderer
was will probably remain a mystery.
Whether tho murderer still lurks among
the living, old and gray, or whether^ he
long ago went to his Judgment those now
living will probably never know." â

Mrs. Cornell /says her, husband will.re
turn from the south In a few days, when
he\wilU undonbtedly set about establish
ing the fact In Hartford that he is still
among the living. c .
My husband was discharged at Camp Wal
lace November 24, 1901, and Immediately ob
tained a clerkship in one -of the Government
offices. Later he taught a night school in Ma
nila, and it was there he and Superintendent
Stone became fast friends. I cAft't imagine
how Mr. Stone received the Info7matton that
Arthur had died, unless it was a case of mis
taken Identity. I know my husband had valu
able papers with him In the Â¦ Philippines . but
I do: not know who he entrusted with them
It ' Is possible that . the person died In the
Philippines and the' papers in his possession
led to the mistaken Identity.
Cornell enlisted In the Spanish-Ameri
can, war from. Hartford and in 1S96 was
assigned to the hospital corps in Manila.
Several weeks ago Mason S. Stone, super
intendent; of schools In Manila, returned
to Hartford with .the report ,that Cornell
was dead and bringing with him papers
of value belonging to the supposed dead
soldier. Through the aid of the news
papers of Cornell's native town efforts
were made to locate the mother of the
soldier, who, it was learned, had re
married and moved elsewhere.
Inquiries lately published in the Hart
ford papers regarding Cornell' wore read
in-.this city by Clerk Stone of the Occi
dental Hotel, who formerly lived in that
city and readily recalled flavin* met in
a casual -way a soldier named Cornell
some months ago. AlPthat Stone could
recall of his conversation with the new
acquaintance Was that Cornell had re
cently returned from the Philippines and
was affout to be -married, it was this
slight clew that led to the identity of
Cornell and through the address given by
Cornell In his application for a marriage
license a reporter of The Call' was enabled
yesterday to find Mrs. Cornell, who until
her marriage on January 30 lafct, was
Miss Ella McOrath, who lived with her
parents at 1529 Dolores street. When'told
of the existing belief in Hartford that her
husband is dead she said:
While Arthur M.- Cornell is patiently
making: a future for himself and wife in
this city It has developed that he Is be
ing mourned as dead by friends in his
former home in Hartford, Conn., a fact
of which he is at present in blissful ignor
ance. As a commercial traveler for a
company of this city he is now soliciting
business in Southern California and when
he returns in a few* days he will learn
for the first time from his bride of a few
weeks that Hartford people arc endeavor
ing to locate his relatives with a view of
turning over effects which were found on
the body of a soldier who was killed in
tho Philippines some months ago and
wh.o was supposed to be Cornell. ;"': : X'

should be garrisoned by the army or by
marines. Secretary Root already has
taken steps to place troops at Guanta
namo and Bahla Honda, and some of the
naval officers are not well pleased at his
action. Secretary Root, by Invitation,
briefly addressed the board, saying that
he believed good results would come from
its deliberations on Questions affecting
both branches of the war force of the
nation and that a joint board was better
tfian routine official communications. Ho
believed that the questions to be brought
before the board and considered in times
of peace would result in a better under
standing and more in the
defense of the country in time of war.
The board adjourned subject to tho call
of the chairman and will not reassemble
until autumn, as Admiral Dewey and
several members are to leave town for
several weeks.
The first meeting of the general policy
board was held to-day. There were pres
ent Admiral Dewey, Rear Admiral Taylor.
Captain Pillsbury, Commander Barnett.
Major General Corbin. Brigadier General
Randolph and Brigadier General Bliss.
Major General Young, the other member
of the board, was not in town.
In addition to this the department Is
to award two classes of prizes for gun

REDWOOD CITY, July 30.â The funeral
of George Lepalmc, the young man who
was shot through the. heart while bath-
Ing near Beresford Tuesday last, will
take place to-morrow^from the undertak
ing parlors of James Crowe. The mother
Of the boy arrived in- San Francisco from
Los Angeles to-day and will be here- to
morrow; to take charge of the body,
which will be Interred in Cypress Lawn
Cemetery. The two young men who are
Held responsible for the boy's death are
still in jail at this place, although they
have made, efforts to be released on ball.
They will be held until after the inquest
on Tuesday, next, when it will be deter
mined whether the evidence will Justify
their being held longer. The autopsy per
formed by Dr. J. L. Ross upon the body
of. the boy shows that' death was caused
by. a rifle ball from a 22-callber rifle.
f Young Howard H. McClellan and.Breco
Martlne, the two young men In Jail, claim
that the death was the result of an acci
dent. . They say they wero Bb/joting at
a' telephone pole from the premises of
young McClellan's uncle and that they
did not see the boys, who were bathing
In . the creek. McClellan seemed greatly
relieved when*he was told that the death
was caused from a rifle ball, as he claims
that during the target practice he was
using a 38-callber revolver and never had
the rifle in his hands.
Â¦While both McClellan and MartinÂ© in
sist that they were unaware of the pres
ence of the boys, > it Is said that the of
ficers have evidence that will disprove
their/nssertlons. It Is saldthat both of
the accused young men. saw the boys In
swimming in . tho creek when Lepalme
met his death. It is further said that
George-, McClellan, an uncle of Howard,
had seen : the" boys and 'shouted to them
to get off the premises. As they were
fully 600 yards away it is not known
whether. they heard the w"arnlng or not.
Another peculiar feature. about the affair
Is that the telephone pole at which the
men claim they were shooting is not in
line with the place where the boys wero
swimming, but Is far. from being In line.
Not only thla one shot went In the direc
tion of the boys, but for a considerable
time the bullets whistled over them and
the boys lay flat on the ground to avoid
being shot. Lepalme was crossing to
where his friends were lying when he
cried, "My God, I'm hit," ran a few steps,
fell headlong In the midst of his compan
ions and expired Instantly. Shortly af
terward McClellan an<^ Mar'tine, with
guns -in hand, approached the bathing"
party. Learning what they had done,
they came' to this city and gave them
selves up. . .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
To the fame endâ that of establishing
a general standard in all departments of
the railroadâ Southern Pacific officials
have completed, after a long conference
In Chicago, a complete revolution In the
mechanical department. Provision has
been made for the adoption of gauges and
measurements eo that there will be one
standard for every article used In, con
struction and equipment from a nut and
bolt up. This work engaged the closest
attention of many of the system's promi
nent officials and particularly its con
structing and maintenance engineers.
A large number of minor changes In the
train rules have been made to conform
them to the national standard. Care has
been taken' to more explicitly lay down
the law for the governing of passenger
train crews. Very definite instructions
are riven rear brakemen of passenger
trains with relation to the duties in "nag
ging" approaching trains. They are espe
cially warned about the use of fuses' at
niRht as signals, and the national rules are
closely . followed in this regard. Minor
changes are also made In the sounding of
train whistle signals.
The new rul e means briefly that one
train shall not leave a station within five
minutes of the time under which a train
ahead is moving. This is an operating
regulation designed as a protection
against rear-end collisions, like ' that
which occurred at Byron. It Is aimed to
keep trains a sufficient distance apart to
insure absolute safety to them. The
"block" system, which is designed to pre
vent two trains from running within a
certain section of track in the same di
rection, gives a protection that cannot be
utilized on single track roads hot thus
equipped. Â¦â¢ -
New rules and regulations covering "the
operation of trains have been Issued by
the Southern Pacific Company as a result
of a movement throughout the United
Stat>s to bring all of the railroad sys
tems under one standard of regulation for
train handling.
In line with this idea the company has
adopted the standard five-minute limit
between trains that Is in force on all of
the Eastern roads. This time Is exactly
one-half of the lirnlt formerly in use on
the lines of the \Southern Pacific Com
pany. Heretofore ten minutes has been
the leeway allowed between trains oper
ating on the same track. By reducing It
to five minutes the company adopts a
limit that is used on roads that are largely
operated under the "block" system, ren
dering the need for a wider margin be
tween trains less than on a road where
the tracks are not protected by the
"block" automatic method.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, July 30.
Mr. Chapman has also prepared a list
of assessments taken at random from all
over Alameda County. These assessments
p how that in every case private holdings
are assessed at a greater value than the
mortgages upon them, while tho Oakland
Transit Consolidated has a mortgage upon
it of *4.5?6.500, and yet the entire property
Is assessed for only $1,300,000.
This ia a portion of the showing that
the county Board of Equalization will
have to face on Saturday next, when the
final hearing when the case comes be
fore it.
This Is to say nothing of the exclusive
f Â» anchlses and prlviTeges enjoyed in the
crowing communities of Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley, which amount to
monopolies a/id will prevent any other
corporation ever finding ltÂ« way into these
cities.
In addition to this bonded indebtedness
there are â¬9,000 shares of stock out. This
stock is valued by the corporation itÂ«
self in the prospectus of Its assets at $G0
a share, which would make the stock value
cf the corporation $4,140,000.
According to these figures, which are
the market value of the stock and bonds,
the corporation is worth in the money
market of the present day a total of
$5,716,500.
FRANCHISES VALUABLE.
Mr. Chapman is armed with facts and
ready to eo ah^ad. He has ascertained
that there are three classes of bouds of
the Oakland Transit Company outstand
ing. Of the first class there are 1409
bones outstanding of a par value of $1000
and a market value of $121 50 on each $100,
which would make the par value $1,400,000
snd the market value $1,701,000. Of the
second class there are 1CO0 bonds out
standing, of a total par value of $1,600,000,
which, as the Stock Board value Is $105,
would be a market value of J1.CS0.O00. The
third class of bonds is a little below par.
There are 1200 of these out, but as they
ere selling at 99*4 the market value would
only be 11,165,500. The total value of all
bonds of the Oakland Transit Company
outstanding is $4,576,500, which is really
the mortgage upon the property.
last day upon which the county Board of
Kqualization can meet or act, and a vote
upon this matter will be necessary upon
that day. It will be impossible to present
the case of the petitioners to the public
Irfore the Board of Equalization will
have adjourned, and by this delay all
pressure from the people will have been
The charge Is made on the part of those
behind the petition for an increase of this
assessment that the postponement was
taken until Saturday because that is the
ANXIOUS FOB DELAY.
The County Board of Equalization post
poned to-day the hearing of the petition
to have the assessment of the Oakland
Transit Company Consolidated increased
until Saturday, but this was not done
until M. C. Chapman, representing the
petitioners, and Harmon Bell, represent
ing the Transit Company, had made re
marks of the most pointed character to
each other. Mr. Chapman openly charged
:hat the Transit Company wanted to delay
ihe hearing, and that as Saturday Is the
last day upon which applications for re
ductions or increases can be made, they
desired to have the matter passed until
that day, because t. ere will then be no
publicity until after the Supervisors have
acted. But despite this, the hearing was
set fcr Saturday morning next at 9
o'clock, at which time Mr. Chapman and
those behind the petition will be heard,
â¢while in the afternoon the Transit Com
pany will be given an opportunity to set
l^rth its side of the case.
When the now celebrated case of the
petition of citizens to have the Transit
< >mpany's assessment raised was called,
Harmon Bell appeared for the corpora
tion and asked that he be given an op
portunity to prepare for the examination
of C. S. MacMullen. who had sworn to
the affidavit and supplemental petition
that had been filed.
NOT ON ASSESSMENT ROLL.
"Mr. MacMuIlen's name does not ap
pear upon either the petition or the as
f-psfinent roll," said Mr. "and yet
fc*> appears as the prlnciiÂ»il one behind
t! is fcction. Mr. Chapman replied:
Mr. 15*11 appear* to be hiding behind minor
i Â¦vh-irohtSe*. What %e would like to know It
whether Mr. B*H propose to meet these allega
tion* Kiuarely or whether he propoeÂ«s fight for â¢
". ircif end delay. It is well known that this pe
ttttaa if in proper legal form. It Is not neces
sary thÂ«t the one who cvetrt to the affidavit
fl.ouifl either be on the petition or the assess
r.ier.t roll, and the question before the board
enl tx-tore the people Is whether Mr. Bell and
}-.:* r])en\ propose to hiile behind quibbles or
v â¢ ftber they propose to come out Into the open
and KB the pecple what they want to know.
It ia not a question of who Is on or who is not
tn this petition, ar.d Mr. Bell does not attack
;Â¦. -calUy or its furtn. but it ie a question of
v. bettoer the Oakland Transit Consolidated n
a>seÂ»fcf>l ior fi.anO.UUO when the property is
irortJi mas? niilliÂ«>ns of dollar* more. Surely
*'r. Bell ought tn be able to *how whether the j
pr petty <i t:r clients 1b properly esseesed or '
wlirther it ii- BoC
We are rfa^'.y to go en to-day, and yet the ;
Tn&ktt Company want* a continuance until
Katnrday. The fait is that Saturday is the
left day upon whi'-h a heanr.i? can V>e had by !
U;is board. If the hÂ»ar'.np Is j-ostponM until j
r-"atuiÂ«lay_ it m'.chr an well be dismissed, for at j
that time thcr* ctn be no C!seu&*ion of the j
irerltf of the case. By delay and filibustering |
and titking advantfige of technicalities the mi- ]
Un day can be eenrumrd. and the actual merits j
cf the controversy can never be re-ached. This
is merely j.uttiryer the matter over until the
< ii-.piuh hour, and we will be deprived of any
< : v-rtuni:>- to go into cur tide of the case hon
cÂ«t!y and fajrly. â¢
MADE AT LATE DAY.
ilr Bell interrupted with :
Mr. aiarMjilcn bM made hi* cxr.pla.tnt at a
]Â«:* day. ani we ere not to be deprived ct our
DrfliSUT rlpht* because he did. It Is not our
lau.t That Mr. MacMulirn brought this matter
Dp t-o Itte ar.d rr.ade the time for a hearing so
irhrrt.
"You have had & sceek, for you were
ratified cf this a Â¦week ago. and yet you
if me here asking for delay," said Chap
rr.an.
Te are rot like Mr. MacMullen, who
i ?.r, devote all of his time to the defense
> f the- public Interests," sarcastically re
pUed Bell.
"All that we want is an opportunity to
â¢j-ut in our case before it becomes too
iate." said Chapman. "We only" want a
hearing upon the merits and not the
technicalities of the case."
Then there was a discussion of the time
lo be a'.lowed each side, and it was agreed
that the petitioners should have three
hours in the morning and the Transit Com
pany three hours in the afternoon, and
v.ith Chapman still unsatisfied the equal
izers adjourned.

are encountered we shall incorporate a com
pany to raanace the enterprise during the
next four weeks. Tho projectors of the road
hoj>e to have the road doing businÂ«9 between

When seen yesterday Gage stated that
the parties interested have been making
surveys for a number of months and
have nearly completed their work. They
hope to begin the construction within a
few raocths. The plan is to build a stand
ard gauge road from Stockton to the val

Big Oak Flat, around the sawmills to
Merced, Hamilton and Crocker and then
to the entrance of the valley. In dis
cussing the road Gate said:

With the New York are the Marble
head and Bennlngton. The vessels were
steaming along In close order, the New
York in the lead, through a dense fog.
According to the chart j and an observa
tion obtained Just before the fog shut
down," there was plenty of clear, deep
water for miles in every direction and the
flagship set a fairly speedy gait.
"Breakers ahead!" came suddenly from
the lookout forward. - The flagship was
stopped and the j other 1 vessels j were or
dered , to do the same. All anchored and
no move was made till .tJie fog lifted.
Ahead, in every direction, could then be
seen breaking water and: not a quarter
of a mile ahead was an island, on which,
but tor the lookout's keen ears, the New
York and her gunboat escort would in ten
minutes mpre have been piled.
- The health of the fleet is reported good.
The crews of all three vessels are catch
ing an abundance of fish, 500 pounds of
gray cod having been hauled aboard the
New York on one morning as the result
of an . hour's fishing. The squadron will
be back in this harbor about Septem
ber 15. 'Â¦â¢â¢.>?r-.
According to a letter received in this

CHICAGO. July 30. â There was a good gen
eral demand for wheat at the opening, due
to the advances in the foreign markets, and
Initial sales were at higher prices, September
being %Â©%c. higher at 79%@70%c. The
hfKher prices brought out heavy realizing
sales and the market turned weak early in
the day September declining to 78%c. Re
ports of frosts In the Northwest and good
buying by large commission houses brought
about a rally later In the session, the market
becoming strong, September advancing to 80%c.
Liquidation by local longs late In the day,
together with the easier tone In corn, caused
another setback, but the close was firm, with
September Vt@%o higher at 79%Â©79%c.
Further rainfall In the West, Including the
greater portion of Kansas, caused, an easier
tone In corn and there was considerable sell
ing throughout the entire day, but the strength
In wheat had a rallying effect and at times
the market showed some, firmness. Shorts
were good buyers on the declines and there
was also fair buying by commission honses.
The close was steady, with* September un
changed at 52%c.
Â¦ ' Oats ruled quiet, with prices firm In sym
pathy with the strength In wheat. Commis
sion houses were early sellers, but the demand
was sufficient to hold prices. The close was
firm with September %0V4c higher at 33%c.
Provisions opened weak, with considerable
selling pressure on lard. At the outset the
market appeared to have little support, but
later there was enough local buying to cause
a slight rally. The close was easiÂ«r, Septem
ber pork being 5c lower at $13 90, with lard
off 10c at $7 97%. September ribs were up
5c. closing at $8 12%.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

FUTURES
CASH WHEAT.
WHEAT â The foreign markets were firm,
with Paris and Liverpool futures higher.
Chicago advanced ,1c with the crowd very
bullish, all operators long and the largest trad
ing for months. Frosts were reported in the
Northwest. The Chicago letter of Bolton. de
Ruyter & Co. eaid* "The market was again
active and closed a fraction higher than yes
terday. It sold up sharply during the early
part of the day, but eased off at the close on
profit taking. Liverpool shows a disposition to
follow advances here". Unfavorable weather In
the United Kingdom and France probably con
tributes. The export business was moderate,
but Minneapolis reports a' demand for Flour
from abroad. There has been no demand of
late. Some sections of the Northwest report
frost last night. The damage. If anything, is
still uncertain. Both Kansas City and St.
Louis report a good milling demand for wheat,
and prices from %c to lc higher. The Price
Current says there Â¦ is a moderate disappoint
ment in yields of wheat The general consen
sus of reports from the' Northwest seems to
show reduced estimates . of the probable out
come. The market here was broad and active.
After several days' advance, a reaction may
be due, but we still feel that wheat should be
bought on the breaks. Primary movements are
small and we think will continue so. With
bare bins everywhere a good demand should
develop."
The feeling here Is firm, and futures are
again slightly higher. California is now the
highest market in the world, though the causes
are local, and not'consldered permanent. Hot.
dry weather some time ago cut down the yield
and the threshing returns are showing a short
age all along the line. Most farmers find that
they have more bags than they can fllL Flour
is headed this way and some has already ar
rived from the East. California U out of old
Wheat and the new crop as yet affords no-re
lief, hence the present strength.

Everything was dull In the morning and

In the afternoon Spring Valley Water de
clined to $84 50. Giant Powder to $68 50 and
Alaska Packers' to $146. The latter stock has
been declining for several days.
The Jenpy Llnd Mining Company has levied

NEW YOnK. July SO. â Yesterday's check to
the recovery lr. prices was supplemented to-day
by a reaction. There was no acute weakness,
except for the eccentric plunges among the in
active specialties, but the demand dimli>lshed
to nominal proportion*. Commission houses
which reported yesterday an awaiting inquiry
for dicks found to-day that the slight reac
tion in prices had almost entirely discouraged
this buying and in some cases had induced
buyers to get out of the market again hur
riedly A constant drip of small selling un
dermined the market and caused prices to
crumble. The early celling centered on Atchl
son, following up the late movement of yes
terday. The general list resisted for a tin.e
until some of the specialties began to make
violent declines. Tho weakness then became
quite ireneral. Several of the profeesid reasons
for yesterday's selling of Atchlson were cleared
to-day with strengthening the stock In the
market. Official denials were made of rumors
of a coming bond issue and of an alleged un
successful attempt to negotiate a temporary
loan by the company.
The report* of rains in the Southwest with
expected benefit to the coj-a crop disposed of
another ground of weakness. .The selling was
partly by professional bears, but the sus
picion remained that long stock waB coming
upon the market and made an unfavorable im
pression upon speculative sentiment in the
wheat market. An unfavorable showing of
June net earnings by reason of floorf damage
and a boar raid to dislodge a pool holding of
stock were hinted at. A feature of the eitua
tlon i* the revival of various reports, running
from the plausible to the highly^ trf/probable
of new combinations and absorptions of rail
road systems. The policy of combination of
available railroad systems doubtless has favor
In the 'railroad world and the liquidation which
ha* been forced In Â«ome shares has offered at
tractive opportunities for absorption. In strong
contrast to the extravagant valuations at
which the mergers of the boom period were
consummated.
Some resumption of the speculative excite
ment in cotton was against the stock market
and the large speculation developing in the
grain markets is looked upon with a degree of
apprehension owing to the general financial
situation. Corn showed strength to-day In
epite of the favorable crop news and there
was tome fear that the spring wheat crop was
suffering further deterioration.
The money market showed growing ease for
time loans, but the movement of prices of
specialties on the Stock Exchange indicated
that there was some selling out of collateral
In loans. Stocks recovered a large part of
their declines late In the day when the liqui
dation in Atchison had spent Its force, and
the closing was apathetic and not far from
last night's level.
In the bond market Chicago Terminal trans
fer 4a were offered down 6% Just before the
close. Toledo, St. Louis and Western 4s fell 3.
The bond market was quite broad and ehowed
a good Inquiry, although some of the Inactive
Investment issues were marketable at con
siderable concessions from last /prices. Total
sales, par value, $2,410,000. United States as
declined 1 and the old 4s 1% per cent on the
last call.

NEW YORK MINING STOCKS.
A new banking-house will open its doors
to-morrow in this city, the International
Bank and Trust Company of America.
George A. Hill ia the manager and Irving
Lundborg the cashier. The Institution is
at 412 Montgomery street. -There are
branches in San Francisco, Seattle, Wil
mington. Del.; Providence, R. I.; Mexico
City, Guadalajara. Agruaa Callentes, San
Luis Potosi, Tampico, Puebla. Pachuca
and Monterey. Mexico. The New York
agency Is at 64 Wall street. William H.
Hunt is the president. Charles Francia
Phillips and J. H. Maugham are vice
presidents. J. O. Rice Is thÂ© treasurer and
Walter R. Morris the secretary.
While the new institution will transact
a general banking: and trust business, in
cluding the receiving of savings deposits,
the motive back of the establishment of
a branch In this city, as explained by
Manager Hill, Is the encouragement of
business relations between the United
States and the Spanish-American coun
tries, Mexico and the states of Central
and South America. It has been the- fact
for years that the business of South and
Central America has been transacted al
most exclusively by the English and Ger
mans. Recently the Americans have be
gun to get into the field. With the rapid
growth of trade has come a demand for
better banking facilities in connection
with the Spanish-American countries. The
great volume of Spanish-American trad*
to and from the countries to the south of
the United States will pass through New-
York. San Francisco and Seattle, and this
consideration has led to the placing of
two Pacific Coast branches, respectively
at. San Francisco and Seattle. The au
thorized capital of the banking company
is $10,000,000. ; Â¦;â¢-

The admitted" facts of the case were
that Richard Fitzgerald applied for.a'llfe
insurance . policy for $10,000 and gave two
promissory \ notes, one ' payable in three
and the other in six months. The policy
was sent from, the company's chief of
fice in New York 'to Fitzgerald's address
in Oakland, but he had removed to Brit
ish Columbia, where he died, and the pol
icy was never delivered. Â¦
Charles A. McLane, the local manager
of the company, testified that he in
structed the local agent, Edward H. Os
borne, not to" deliver the policy 'to Fitz
gerald unless â¢ Fitzgerald had paid $301
cash, the, company being unwilling to give
him credit. Several letters, one contain
ing the notes, were sent to Fitzgerald,
asking him for payment, but the letters
and notes were returned.
McLane's evidence was contradicted by
that of Osborne, who testified that Mc-
Lane never told him not to deliver the
policy until Fitzgerald had paid the notes.
The suit of Michael Fitzgerald, as ad
ministrator of the estate of Richard Fitz
gerald/against the New York Life Insur
ance Company, was tried yesterday be
fore United States District Judge Beatty,
sitting In the United States Circuit Court,
and was submitted after argument.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Herman Epplnger went to the office of
Chickering & Gregory on this summons
and gave to Bowles and McNear two or
ders for grain In the Pacific Coast ware
houses to cover their loans. Herman
Eppinger went to his office and brought
in as additional security notes amounting
to $3068 04. *
Bowles was asked' how he was led to
inquire into the affairs of Eppinger &
Co. His response was that It was through
business prudence.
Jacob Eppinger was present when the
foregoing testimony- was given, but he
was not called upon to testify. The hear
ing will be continued on Monday next at
10 o'clock. -3S5SG
A. O. Platt. the expert accountant em
ployed by the receiver of Eppinger & Co.
to investigate the books, testified that the
sums drawn out and not entered upon the
books amounted to $234,000. There had
not been a trial balance of the books of
Eppinger & Co. in many years.
P. E. Bowles, manager of the American
National Bank, testified that he grew
fearful concerning the affairs of the Ep
plngers In May, and on the second day of
May, sent Inspector Bunker to the ware
houses of the Pacific Coast "Warehouse
Company at Crockett to get a report con
cerning the grain' in warehouses. From
Bunker it was learned that there was a
discrepancy In both the quantity and the
quality of grain in storage. Then Bowles
sent for Herman Eppinger and demanded
that the* Eppingers should take up their
loans. These amounted to $62,000. Her
man Eppinger said that Jacob Eppinger
attended to that branch of the business
and he promised to send Jacob to Bowles.
"When Jacob came he said he wanted ten
days* time In which to raise the money,
and represented that aa a ship was due
to sail in ten days the firm would then
come into the money necessary to make
the payments demanded.
This proposition did Â¦ not meet
with the approval of Bowlea. He
went to the office . of Chickerinsr
& Gregory, attorneys, and was accom
panied by*George P. McXear, a nephew
of*G. W. McNear. The attorneys advised
Bowles to call op Eppinger & Co. by tele
phone and Bowles followed this advice.
According to Mitchell's testimony Jacob
Eppinger tore checks from the firm's
checkbook without making any entry on
the stub to indicate that fact. This was
Jacob's practice during eight or nine
years. When the checks came back from
the bank Joe Eppinger tore them up. Thl3
happened about twice per month on the
average. The only way that the books
could be made to balance was by taking
the balances of the bank and putting in
wrong figures at the bottom of the col
umn.
The taking of testimony concerning: the
business transactions of Eppinger & Co.
was resumed yesterday before Milton J.
Green, receiver in bankruptcy. The most
interesting statements made under oath
were by Frank Mitchell, the bookkeeper
of the firm, and Expert Accountant
Platt. -:l'--

I Consul -Chester submits the following
detailed table of Hungary's walnut trade
in 1901:
Hungary's export of walnuts is usually
much larger than the import; on the other
hand consul Chester says that Hungary
is a. good market for almonds and hazel
nuts,, the import of each of which ex
ceeded the export in 1901 by about 1.000,000
pounds. Of this heavy import it will bo
interesting to state that 221 pounds of al
monds came to Hungary from Cuba or
Porto Rico, classed as "Southern fruit."
and C61% pounds of hazelnuts came from
Brazil as.' "Fresh fruit."
United States Consul Chester In his re
port says that walnuts are not sold be
fore the crop Is ready for delivery, begin
ning about October 15, at which time only
are prices quotable.
The walnut crop at Hungary is expected
to be a good one. The home crop gen
erally amounts to anywhere between 150
and 220 carloads of 10,000 kilos, or ten
tons each. Payments are usually cash
against bills of lading, and delivery takes
place as determined by seller from the
place of production any time up to No
vember 10.
HTTNGARY'S WALNUT TRADE.
Crowninshield estimates that the price
will be about $2 75 per box free on board.
The rates of freight may be taken at lOd
per box by the ordinary steamers. and Is
per box by the faster ones, as against
Is 'and Is 4d respectively last year. \
As for walnuts, it was too early at the
lime the report was sent out to form any
definite Idea as to the prospects for the
new crop. The new trees," however, have
given by their blossoming every indication
that tbÂ«Â»r*> will be a good average crop,
providing that the weather conditions are
favorable up to October, when the ship
ping season begins.
Important reports have Just' been re
ceived by the State Horticultural Society
from C.vS. Crowninshield. United States
Commercial Agent at Castellamare dt
Stabia, Italy, and Frank Dwyer Chester,
United States Consul. at Budapest, Hun
gary, anent the lemon and walnut produc
tion for the summer in Italy and the wal
nut production in Hungary.
CrOwninshield reports that this sum
mer's croo of lemons In Italy will be a
good average one, and while larger than
that of last^year, the leaves some
thing, to be desired as regards size and
appearance. The quality, he says, not
being up to the usual standard for keep
ing, will not permit of . more than one
half being . shipped to places like the
United Stales, where a long voyage Is
necessary. CrowninA^ield thinks, there
fore, that it. is quite probable that the
shipments of lemons to America will fall
short of the usual amount. He judges
that the yield will be about 90,000 boxes,
of which only one-third will be available
for shipment to the United States. The
remainder- will be disposed of In Euro
pean'markets. Though the quality of the
lemons is somewhat below the average
the portions shipped to America will be
specially selected and of the usual grade.

The contest for possession of the Re
publican works In the Forty-first Assem
bly District has developed considerable
strategy. The combination effected In the
district^ between the Republican C(ub,
represented by Judge Dibble, George
Walker and A. K. Daggett, and the lead
ing members of the old Horace Davis
Club, represented by Sheldon G. Kellogg,
Colonel Currier and C. A. Murdock, acting
with the sanction of Mr. Davis, has cre
ated a certain degree of consternation in
the United Republican Club, of which L.
S. Beedy.is president, and In which Mr.
Son, representing Abe Ruef, and Lester
Burnett are the leading spirits. It is now
reported that in order to break the force
of the combination between the Dibble-
WalkeriDaggett club and the Davls-Kel
logg-Murdock people, the United Republi
cans will put some of the same men from
the Horace Davis Club on their ticket.
It is reported, however, that Kellogg
and his friends eay that while they can
not prevent and will . not try 1^*- prevent
their names being put on the other ticket,
they intend to loyally support the ticket
of the Regular Republican Club. They
say that they entered Into the alliance aa
a matter of principle: that they j favor
home rule. in the district. and are. against
the^nomlnation of Mayor Schmitz by. the
Republican convention. .
Whether the United Republicans will
take them ori the ticket under these cir
cumstances remains to be seen.
STRATEGY IN FORTY-FIRST.
The meeting, which waS attended by
the organization committee of the United
Republican. League, was addressed by A.
Ruef, Henry Ach. John C. Lynch and

DOCTORS BOOKS
TO COVER FRAUD
Ed P. Brock, cashier, declined to reply
to the accusations of Worthlngton, say
ing: "Our investments did not turn out
as well as we expected. '
The posting of the notice caused con
siderable excitement in the town, as tha
deposits of the institution are large. The
bank examiners have been workins: on
tha books of the institution for two days
past, but no statement has been issued
either by them or the officers of the bank.
George P. Beck Is cashier of the bank.
The capital of the bank was $106,000 and
the last report to the Comptroller showed:
Surplus and profits. $131,780; deposits, over
$1,000,000; loans and discounts and stock
and securities, $1,031,360.
The bank is one of the oldest in the
State.. Its president is Henry Leer, a
prominent lawyer and candidate for Judge
on the Republican ticket.
"The losses," said Deputy Comptroller
Kane to-day, "will absorb the entire sur
plus and capital stock of the bank. In
other words the total loss will amount to
$215,000, and it devolves upon the directors
and stockholders to make up this de
ficiency."
Francis L. Worthington, a director, said:
''The president and cashier ran things to
suit themselves. I suppose I will lose
all through mismanagement of the offi
cers. No one suspected anything wrong.
I understand there was some speculation
âConsolidated Lake Superior, I believeâ
and in that stock most of the money may
have been sunk." .-

structed, which will be invaluable for
better communication and to guard the
customs service. Despite these expendi
tures he said, the surplus of between
$5,000,000 and $6,000,000 already accrued will
be left intact if. not increased.
He said that no mention '. had - reached
the islands of the. probability, of, Gover
nor Taft becoming a running mate with
President Roosevelt In the next campaign.
Such a contingency, he said, would be
regretted by the Filipinos, who hold the
Governor In the highest esteem and give
him their fullest trust,, for, which reason
they t?o"ld not Nice to have him leave
his present post.
Commissioner Worcester was a member
of the first Philippine Commission and
was reappolnted to succeed himself at
the expiration of his term. He wat'for
merly assistant professor of soology In
th"e University of Michigan and first vis
ited the islands fn 1887 to gather informa
tion regarding birds and mammals.
The financial outlook for. the islands . Is
bright, acordlng to Commissioner Wor
cester. Before he left the commission
had already commenced the preparation
for the next semi-annual budget and was
engaged in Interrogating the heads of all
Government bureaus," with a view to
cutting out all superfluous Items in their
estimates for conducting their depart
ments. These estimates had been scaled
down considerably, and while the Com
missioner was not able to say that any
great reduction would be made from the
running expenses of the last six months
he felt certain that they would not be
Increased. Â¦"'â¢â¢', v -
men owing to his supposed responsibility
for General Luna's death.
FINANCIAL OUTLOOK BRIGHT.
Speaking of the conditions In the Islands
he conflrrried the reports of > tranquillity
except those trebles arising from the op
erations of a {%<v robber bands in the
vicinity of Manila. These are being broken
up as rapidly as possible by the island
constabulary, assisted where it is neces
sary by the military. The 1 system of la
dronlsm. he said. Is now practically co
existent with the" Spanish occupation of
the islands and- has become: a recognized
custom. Manifestly, he said, it Is-impos
sible to crush it out in a few months, but
at present the islands are freer from these
depredations than they ever have been
since Spanish occupation.
AH armed . opposition to â¢ the insular
government, he said, has ceased, and the
former opponents . of -, the . -United '. States
are now satisfied to employ, reason and
the power of suasion, for! the purpose of
obtaining -.the conditions they.Beek.'
Agulnaldo is now a resident of Manila,
occupying a house across the street from
the residence of Commissioner ' Wright.
He takes no active part In public affairs,
his retirement being probably due to the
timidity he feels on account of the enmity
held against him by, many of his country-

He described the Lake Lanao region as
one thau-had never before been pene
trated by white men. The lake is about
sixteen miles square, roughly- speaking,
and around its borders live about 100.000
Moros who, from our standpoint, are sav
ages. Generally they are armed with ri
fles and revolvers and also carry the na
tive MaJay weapon, a kriss. They are
agriculturists and cattle raisers and
make forays on the coast towns of the
island. They acknowledge the authority
of certain dattos or chiefs and generally
speaking are divided into three tribes.
During his entire campaign in the lakf^
region Captain Pershing lost only two
men In battle, although 'several died from
cholera, which prevailed at the time.

Captain Pershing's most remarkable ex
ploit was his Journey alone and unarmed
into the heart of the l^ake Lanao coun
try, where he mixed freely with the hos
tile Moros and returned unharmed. He
undertook this expedition about two
years ago. and as a result he made such
a favorable impression on the Dattos, or
native governors, on the north side of
the lake that the expedition taken with
an armed force a year later was met with
kindness. In fact, the troops . never had
any trouble on the, north side of- the lake.
When he was asked whether hJhad not
undertaken a great risk in going Into the
country alone, he said he supposed there
was risk but that was part of his busi

It over 250 Moros and two Americans were

defeat settled all opposition to American

Mike Nolan, the leader of the desperate
trio of thugs who cruelly beat and robbed
Mrs. T. V. Mathews at her home, 543
Haight street, on March I, yesterday
pleaded guilty Jo the charge of robbery
before Judge Carroll Cook without the
formality of a trial. He also put into the
hands of Attorney William H. Schooler
a lengthy statement, which he hopes will
be effectively used in the appeal for a
new trial to be made by Schooler before
the Supreme Court In behalf of Docia
Nolan, now under sentence of eight years
for complicity in the Mathews robbery.
But Nolan's action is not altogether
prompted by unselfish devotion to his
erstwhile companion and partner In crime,
Docia, tho condemned felon. In his ef
forts to receive a light sentence for his
crime Nolan has sought to establish the
contention that he was not In the house
of Mrs. Ida Tuttle on Haight street on
the afternoon when the brutal assault on
Mrs. Mathews took place, but that a
member of the gang, Henry Lupton, now
under charge of the murder of James
Gllleece on April 14, was with Whitelaw
and Davis when the, crime was commit
ted.
Mike Nolan Waives For
mality of Trial for
. His Crime.
ROBBER LEADER
PLEADS CITY
IK is believed that Davis, the third
anerabeff Â«f the sang, will tollow thÂ» ex
ample of Nolan anfi plead guilty beforr
his case somes tc trial.
Lupton has already told the police that
he had been approached by Nolan with
the purpose of being induced to declare
that he was one of the trio of thugs and
that he received his Information concern
ing the Tuttle diamonds from Nolan, In
stead of his coflsort^. Docia,
Schooler declares thaÂ£ Nolan te inno-?
oenÂ» of actutJ. participation in. the assault
and robbery. He said yesterday u

the robbepy. S think J caU prove fha5
when he comes tip for sentence on Satur-:
day. If I car. find ' c certain individual
I am looking loc 1 sac certainly demon
strate this fact/'
Nolan's efforts to drag Lupton into the
charge falls flat before the evidence In
the hands of the police. It is admitted
that Lupton was undoubtedly a party t9
the scheme, but he Is lame and It la
known by the testimony of the Grills girls
that Nolan, Whitelaw and Davis on that
account purposely gave him the slip on
the afternoon when they went out to. do
the deed. . 'V
LTJPTON SPOILS SCHEME.
The police declare that Nolan's conten
tion that he was not of the party which
beat Mrs. Mathews and ransacked tha
house can t>e disproved by testimony
which they have In their possession. No
lan was seen standing under an umbrella
within twenty feet of the Tuttle home a
few minutes before the assault occurred.
Mrs. Mathews also testified In the trials
of Docia Nolan and Bernard Whltelaw
that she saw Nolan and that he went to
the end of the hall and put his umbrella
behind the door when he entered.
of Miko Nolan came as a. cnrpxlM to
those Interested In the prosecution or the
cases of the trio of thugs. Nolan's ease
had been set last Tuesday for August 17.
at which time Davis was also to answer
for his crime.
Wednesday nisht Nolan sent a letter
to Schooler, saying that he most see him
on urgent business. Early yesterday
morning Schooler went up to the County
Jail and was notified by Nolan that he
wished to plead guilty and receive Im
mediate sentence. When taken before
Judge Cook Nolan's demand for imme
diate sentence was denied on the protest*
by Assistant District Attorney Porter
Ashe that District Attorney Bylngton
should be present when sentence was
passed. Saturday was therefore set as
the time when Nolan shall listen to the
terms of his punishment.
"Well, I tell you right now you are not
going to growl around me," concluded
Moore.
This closed the . controversy. Professor
Plehn will be called to the stand by Llver
nash to-day and it may be several days
before the carmen's counsel will finish
cross-examining him.
"Llvernash replied that he had- every
instinct Of a gentleman and that he did
not care whether Moore liked his tone or
not.
"Don't you take the kind of a tone that
you are now using against* me, for I am
used to being treated in a gentlemanly
manner."
OBJECTS TO TONE.
us to accept fees for making scientific
reports if it does not interfere with our
work," replied the professor.
; At this juncture Attorney Moore ob
jected to LJvemash's line of questions. In
replying Llvernash raised his voice to a
high pitch 5 which was eventually drowned
by Moore, who remarked: â¢ -;'."â¢''
"As. I said a moment ago. they allow
largest labor organizations in this city?"
Livernash asked.
Personally, Captain Perching Is de
lightfully taciturn regarding his own
achievements. He has a soldierly aver
sion to being lionized, and while he is af
fable, and even loquacious, regarding
every other subject, he gives an excellent
imitation of an oyster when questioned
concerning himself. He is about six feet
tall and IÂ«irly heavy in build, with a
equare Jaw, grizzled hair and mustache
and gray eyes. He is not given to laugh
ing, but he smiles often and his manner
is simple and kindly. Responding to
questions, he said:
Really, whatever we have fione in the island
of Mindanao i;n> already been published in the
papers and I cannot think of anything to add.
At present the Moroe are practically subdued
and no further trouble with them is antici
pated.
Captain Pershing was placed in com
mand of the detachment that marched
around Lake Lanao and brought that
hitherto unconquered region under alle
giance to the American flag. He had in
his command a battalion of the Twenty
eeventh Infantry, Kilpatrlck's troop of
the Fifteenth Cavalry and McNair's bat
tery. These marched clear around the
lake, subduing the various tribes with
kindness whore tney could and by Torce
when necessary. Altogether the com
mand had three heavy engag' ments, the
last of which, the battle of Taraca, is so
recent that almost everybody will lemem
hcr it. That was tr t last real conflict. In
While not seriously ill. he is suffering
from complaints brought on by long resi
dence in that tropic region, and as a
means of prevention he determined to
cpend a few months in the United States.
Captain Pershing has been the most
prominent iigure in military movements
In the Philippines dÂ«ring the last year.
He wag in command of practically the
only expeditions that were organized for
the subjugation of the natives during that
time, and his signal success in subduing
the inhabitants of the lake region, in the
interior of Mindanao, has given him a
reputation as a military leader and tac
tician second to that of few men who
have made their reputations in the pos
sessions wrested from the Spaniards dur
ing the recent war.
HERO IS MODEST. '
APTAIN JOHN J. PERSHING.
f the hero of Mindanao and con-
queror of the fierce tribes of
Moros of the Lake Lanao region,
arrived from Manila yesterday on the
Siberia. He has spent four years in the
island of Mindanao without leave, and
his return to this country at this time
was prompted by the fact that the rigors
of the climate had begun to affect his
system.
"Did the Board of Regents know that
you were employed to get up a one-sided
report for capitalists against one of- the
\ Vlt was not necessary," Professor Plehn
replied. "We are allowed to accept work
of this kind if it does not interfere with
our* duties." - ." Â¦' '>:<;
"The information is as much at your
service as to the United Railroads," he
replied. ,'
"While you were securing the evidence
for the report that you have filed were
you still drawing a salary from the Uni
versity of California?" he was then asked.
, "Yes; I secured the information at my
leisure, when the work did. not interfere
with my lectures or preparations."
"Did you get the consent of the Board
of Regents to do this work?" Llvernash
asked.
When Professor Plehn finished reading
his report he was severely cross-examined
by Llvernash.
"Have you frankly. i given, information
as favorable to the carmen's union as the
United Railroads?" the professor was
asked. 8 ,â¢,â¢,.?â¢
Clothing has remained stationary in cost.
Fuel and lighting are cheaper, but neither
are very important items in the total cost of
living.
If we give t to each of the different items
which enter into the total cost of living,
namely, rent 16.00 per cent, food 41.03 per
cent, fuel 5 per cent, clothing 15.31 -per cent,
light .0.90 per cent â¢ and all other (including
expenditures for amusements, sickness, savings
and other uniform Items) 22.70 per cent, its
due weight; and if we assume the largest In
creases found by any method, and if we
neglect the decrease in the cost of fuel and
lighting, assuming instead that they remained
stationary, then the effect of all the increases
of the first four months of 1903 over the first
four -months of 1902 on the total cost of living
Is about 3 per cent
When due allowance is made for the ad
vantages of climate, which' makes living in
San Francisco cost considerably less in fuel
and clothing than in Eastern cities. San
Francisco is undoubtedly the cheapest place
to live in of the fourteen large cities in
vestigated.
Out of 345 street railway companies frC-m
which â¢ reports were received, representing
nearly every State in the Union, only four
report wages in excess of the United Railroads.
The average earnings of carmen in j San
Francisco increased in consequence of the re
arrangement of rates of pay and hours of ser
vice made in April, 1902, by 17% Per cent
over the earnings made prior to that date.
That Â¦: Is, a larger percentage of all men got
full work.
TROUBLE STARTS.
CLOTHING SAME PRICE.
"Another day gone and nobody hurt
yet" was the remark used yesterday by
the. sergeant-at-arms employed to pre
serve "order at the arbitration proceed
ings between the carmen's union and the
United; Railroads. ,
For a while yesterday afternoon, how
ever, â¢ there was a warm altercation be
tween Attorneys Llvernash and Moore,
but adjournment cut short hostilities.
The trouble was occasioned by the ap
pearance of . Carl C. Plehn. professor of
finances and statistics at the University
of California, who was a witness for the
United "Railroads. In his testimony the
professor said in part :
Since January, 1901, the prices of meats and
breadstuffg show a general upward tendency.
Thoee of the more important vegetables, with
the exception of cabbages, show a downward
trend, while a considerable number of others
remained practically stationary- The general
averages for | all ; foods of most irencral con
sumption, ' whether each article be -considered
of Â¦ the same Importance as every other or
whether each be given its proper weight or
importance, : fluctuate practically within the
ilmlts of 105 per cent and 95 per cent of the
prices that prevailed during â¢ April, 1903, a
range, that is. of 10 per cent. But they show
no marked tendency either upward or down
ward. The general averages of the retail
prices for the foodstuffs of most general con
sumption during the first four, months of 1903
were found by , the best of the several methods
followed to bo 1 per cent higher than during
the : same' four months of 1902, and by an
other method to be 3.6 per cent hlKher.
As to rents, the evidence is conflicting, but
the conclusion that there has been an advance
of certainly not more than 10 per cent in
the average seems to be sustained.;
edged the supremacy of the
United States.
GAP-TAIN- JOHN-
J. PERSHING, the
' conqueror of the war
like Moros %vho inhabit
the Lake Lanao region in
the island of Mindanao, is
again on his native shores,
having arrived from Ma
nila on the Siberia. Two
years ago Pershing, then
adjutant general of Min
danao under General Sum
ner, began to plan the sub-"
jugation of the fierce tribes
inhabiting the interior of
the island. Alone and un
armed he went among the
tribes on the north shore
of the lake and succeeded
in winning over the chiefs
so that they offered no op
position to' the military ex
pedition which Captain
Pershing later led among
them. The natives on -the
south side of the lake re
sisted stoutly, and it was
not until the decisive battle
of Bacolod in February last
that all the natives acknowl-
