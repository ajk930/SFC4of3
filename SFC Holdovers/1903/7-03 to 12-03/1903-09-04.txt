. -Â» y. EW YORK. Sept. 3.â The Re
yraL Â¥ liance, the American cup.de
- r / fender, to-day won the third
â¢ â¢ / end final race and the series
JL Â» -for that famous sea trophy,
''. .. the America's Cup. In a
Â¦Â¦ " aense fog which prevented vision beyond
200 yards she finished the race at 5:30:02,
: amid the acclamations of the assembled
" fleetl The Shamrock III after running
for more than an hour in the fog, missed
. the finish line, passed by it and returned
â¢ to" it from the opposite direction. As the
. Reliance was then being towed through
. the fleet, the yacht's ensign fluttering
from her truck and spreaders in celebra-
tion of her victory, the Shamrock III did
cot cross the finish. As often said of the
â¢ historic race when the America won the
cup. "there was no second."
â¢' This successful result was achieved on
. ly after four futile attempts to safl off
the final race, and after victory for the
' Reliance had been admitted by even Sir
â¢Thomas Lipton to be a foregone conclu
". Eion. To-day's was the eighth attempt
to sail a race. After gne fluke the Re
liance won the following two races, one
"by seven minutes an<\thiee seconds and
' the other by one minute Â£.nd nineteen
â¢ .seconds. A week ago to-6ay the first at
tempt to sail the third race failed, anJ at
.â¢ tempts have been made every day this
. week. â¢ On these occasions the Reliance
led the Shamrock to. the finish line by a
wide margin, but failed to reach it be
fore the expiration of the time limit of
. five and one-half hours.'
To-day's \1ctory means that the cup is
Â§ destined to remain in America until Eng
land is able to produce a genius equal
to Hcrreshcff in yacht designing; *7
Barely, it ever, has there been a. more
the ., afternoon papers pub
lish ed ; a - special edition' announcing the
result, but the announcement had already
been discounted by the dispatches giving
the progress of the race.
The consensus of opinion is that Sir
Thomas Lipton has done everything that
time and money could accomplish and
widespread sympathy for him' Is shown.
The chief hope expressed in the streets is
that Canada. will enter the lists next year
and possibly succeed where the . mother
country has failed. It seems. Improbable
that, in view of the failure of Shamrock
III, another challenger will soon be dis
patched from' England.
This morning's papers publish editorials
congratulating the United ' States ' upon
again, retaining^the America's cup and
complimenting Sir Thomas Lipton on his
gallant fight. All the journals agree that
the contests were won by the better boat
and the cleverer skipper and crew, and
admit that there seems to be no reason
why the United States should not retain
the cup for many years to come, since it
seems that Great "Britain has something
tolearn from America in the matter of
yacht building.
The Daily Telegraph expresses the gen
eral feeling, when, paying a , tribute to
the fairness with which the contests were
conducted, it- says: '
"It is "an entirely honorable chapter
'added to the history of the America's
cup." *

at terrific speed through a blinding f og, _
the Reliance burst through the wall of
mist upon the vision of the spectators on
the fleet assembled at the finish line, and,.,
reeling under a great bellying balloon jib
topsail, with hÂ«r lee rail awash, flew
across the finish line almost before the
spectators, could, determine for 4 certain
that it was she. Once more the Yankee
boat had added to the long string of
victories in contests for the "honored" old
silver trophy [ that carried with it~ the
blue ribbon of the sea.
- A fleet of less than thirty Â¦ vessels went
down to the familiar- waters of the inter
national course to witness this fifth ef
fort of the Reliance to co\'er "the course
of thirty miles within the' time limit" It
had become a race of the American boat
against time instead of a contest of two
well-matched craft. When they reached
the lightship a gentle southeast wind of
five knots, that barely wrinkled the sur
face of the sea, gave but faint promise
that this was to be the final day, but a
shift of the wind to the south shortly
after noon revived the despairing hopes
of the yachtsmen, for it blew away the
misty hare which had been hanging over,
the course since the easterly storm of
last week. The regatta committee waited
until the last moment to send the boats
away at 1 o'clock, after* which hour, it
had been agreed, no race should- be
started. Signals were displayed to indi
cate a windward and leeward course of
thirty miles and back. -^

Langley's $70,000 airship was prepared to
be launched to-day. It was placed in
position on the houseboat at 11 o'clock
this morning.
C. M. Manley, Inventor of the motor en
gine, at half -past 1 o'clock, donned a
heavy life-preserver and mounted, the seat
in the airship. For the first time the air
ship was completely rigged. Every wing,
propeller and adjustment was in place
and the machine rea'dy to fly. Before
putting on the Hfe-preserver Manley
shook hands with his assistants and then
climbed into the airship car, dressed In a
pair of light trousers, , the life-preserver,
a coat and his stockinged feet. As he
took his position a rocket was fired, the
signal that all was ready, and those on
the tugs became alert.
"A1J ready in ten minutes," called Pro
fessor Manley to one of his assistants.
He then applied the power.
The propellers gave a spasmodic clutch
and stopped with a jerk. Repeatedly the
civil engineer endeavOTed to get hi3 mo
tor under control, without success.
After many failures the electric spark
Ignited the gasoline and the screws began
to go until they made COO revolutions a
minute. Then the propellers stopped. A
broken valve, up to that time unobserved,
had caused the trouble. No permanent
repairs could be made, and just before 6
o'clock Professor Langley returned to the
houseboat and called the event off.
Manley crawled down from his perch
and shook hands again, and everybody
admitted that he had* had a narrow es

Strong exception also Is taken to the
contention that there was a reservation

there was was made by a commissioner of
customs, and that he had no authority
In the premises.
the controversy, and in this connection
notice is taken of an assertion made by
the British Commissioners that the towns
of Dyea and Skagway owed their exist
ence to the migration to the Klondike.
They assert, on the contrary, that Dyea
was founded in 1SS5 and Skagway In 1888.
They contradict flatly a contention made
by the British Commissioners to the ef
fect "that Canada's claims to the terri
tory at the head of the Lj'nn canal was
at the time well known to the United
States Government."
"This," they eay, "is a gratuitous as
sertion. There is no proof to sustain it.
Canada never put forward any such claim
to the United States. The claim was as
made in 1898 by Great Britain before the
Great Joint High Commission. It is said
'that if the Canadian Government had
instructed British vessels to disregard
these regulations there would have been
grave danger of a serious collision.' There
undoubtedly would have been a collision
just as certainly as if they had been in- j
structed to. disregard the regulations of
the port of New York."
The argument In the case. Is a careful
study of maps, treaties and other docu
ments bearing upon the boundary con
tention, and it is intended to drive home
the facts presented In the statements to
which reference has been made. Con-
Eiderable space is devoted to . the part
played by the Klondike gold discoveries
In arousing Great Britain's Interest in
Discussing the boundaries proposed by
Great Britain, the claim makes refer
ences to the instability of the Canadian
contention on this point and concludes
that "the United States has from the time
of the cession of Alaska to the present
day maintained but one interpretation of
the treaty of 1825. Its position has been
open and known to the world. -It Is the
same which was presented to the tribunal
In ita case and which it now reiterates
in this counter case."
was to be ten marine leagues measured
from the heads of all gulfs and other
arms of the sea, unless th/ere was within
that distance a range of mountains. The
contention is further made that there is
no such mountain range. It also is urged
that the United States has occupied this
strip of territory ever since its acquisi
tion from Russia, and that Russia had
controlled it since the treaty of 1S2S until
ceded to the United States in 1SC7.
In its counter-statement the American
commission makes rejoinder to points
covered in the presentation of the British
Bide of the case, which It appears con
tains twenty or more documents which
heretofore have not been given to the
public.
The additional ovidenc-e referred to
bears upon the negotiations which took
place between Great BrHain and Russia
during the years from 1823 to 1S25 and It
is contended that this new evidence in no
way alters any material contention made
in the original allegation, but that on the
contrary "It confirms and strengthens the
position of the United States."
Those documents consist largely of
"statements made and letters written by
Mr. Pelly, who was at that time Deputy
Governor of the Hudson Bay Company, and
it is contended that his letters fully sus
tain the assertion that, in fixing a line of
demarcation the British Government act
ed solely in the interests of that com
pany. , t
The Commissioners discuss at some
length the claim made . by their oppo
nents that many protests have been filed
by British officials against the American
claims in reference to the boundary line.
They admit that from time to time there
have been informal representations, but
these they assert were in the main with
out sufficient data to Justify serious con
sideration. Indeed, they say, that never
until after the Klondike gold discoveries
were made in 1896 did the British Govern
ment take up the question seriously.
They admit that in 1S9S attention was
called to/ the claim of the British Govern
ment t T fat the ten-league strip extended
only frfm the main waters of the ocean,
but they say that this contention was not
made absolutely clear until the British
case was delivered to the present tribunal
on May 2 last.
In support <3f the American contention
that the strip should measure from tide
water and from the heads of bays and in
lets a number of depositions are pro
duced in connection with the counter
case going to show the occupation of this
strip by settlers from the United States
since 1880. Especial effort is directed
toward showing the control of the country
about the head of Lynn canal. Including
the sites of the towns of Dyea, Skagway,
White Pass and Lake Bennett.
It also is stated that numerous docu
ments have^ been preserved which had
been Eiven to Indian chiefs and others
by officials of the United States showing
the presence in the Lynn canal inlets of
naval and other authorities of the United
States annually for twenty years after
the United States acquired the territory.
It Is contended that this occupation and
control were known to the Canadian Gov
ernment and its people.
ROME, Sept. 3.â A congress of students
which was held to-day at Udlne. ttfÂ«rthÂ«Â»

another anti-Austrian demonstration, due
to the presence of students from those
Italian provinces still under Austrian
rule. Bands played patriotic airs and the
hymn of Trieste, while the flags of the
four Italian provinces not yet united to
Italy were carried at half-mast as a sign
of- mourning and waved among Intense
enthusiasm and patriotic cries.
The Mayor of Udlne delivered a speech
in which he said that the demonstration
was a pledge of brotherly solidarity
among the free and unfreed Italian re
gions. At a certain point In the proceed
ings two or three supposed Austrian spies
were discovered and a tumult ensued. The
alleged spies were seized and threats were
made to burn them alive. The police res

Sir Thomas and Iselin exchanged visits
to-night and Sir Thomas extended con
gratulations.
Of course. I am proud of the result. A
splendid boat, a splendid crew and captain!
All helped to the result. Sir Thomas made a
iiravc fight and deserved better luck, but every
American should be glad the cup is to stay
here.
The Reliance is a beautiful boat; had all
kinds of weather and won in It. Our adversa
ries did the best they could with tho ma
terial at their command.
C. Oliver Iselin was all smiles as he re
plied to an inquiry as to the result:

Asked what he would do with the three
Shamrocks, he said:
I am to meet some people to-morrow who
desire to buy at least one of the boats. After
I have seen them I will determine what to
do.
Regarding the defeat of the Shamrock

The Sultan personally assured Mon
signor Ormanlan, the Armenian patriarch,
that his words applied to the Armenians
as 'well as to the people of other nation

Next, addressing the Greek patriarch,
the Sultan said he regretted that the
Greek population also had suffered from
the recent troubles and declared he would
be pleased to contribute to the subscrip
tions being raised in the patriarchate on
behalf of the sufferers. The Sultan fur
ther remarked that he was very sorry
that some of the soldiers had been guilty

sires.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Sept. 3.â On the
.anniversary of his accession, Tuesday, tho
Sultan received in audience at the pal
ace the heads of. the religious communi
ties, and the ecumenical patriarchs made
speeches of congratulation. In reply
thereto, after thanking the patriarchs
and the others present for their good
wishes, the Sultan, contrary to precedent,
spoke at some length, as follows:
"All my desire is for the welfare of the
population, without distinction of race or
religion. As to the. detestable and regret
table deeds to which the patriarch allud
ed, I am convinced that the movement
does not proceed spontaneously from the
population, but is instigated from abroad.
I hope the measures taken will insure
tranquillity. I call God to witness the
sincerity of my declaration and that all
my aspirations and work arc for the wel
fare and prosperity of all my subjects."'
Turning then to the Bulgarian patri
arch, the Sultan bade him communicate
his works to his flock.

SUAVE WORDS OF SULTAN.
The sky was clear and the slanting rays
of the yellow western sun were paint-
Ing a beautiful marine picture, with the
two yachts as center figures, when at 4 20
o clock, with almost half the course yet
to be sailed, a thick bank of fog came
rolling in before a southeast wind, and
enveloped the Shamrock in a gray mist
that shut her out of sight of the fleet
The Reliance ran along for five min
utes longer with the sun glinting upon
her sails until the fog bank reached her
and she, too, disappeared from sight. As
it caught her she felt also a heavier wind
from the southeast, smothering her spin
naker and leaning to the wind through
the mist. The two racers sailed in that
dangerous fashion" at top speed for an
hour.
Meantime, the Navigator; carrying the
FOG ENVELOPS RACERS.
Heeling to a freshening wind and jumpl
ing into a rising sea, which at times
threw their long bows high out of the
water, to come down with a splash that
sent miniature clouds of foam flying from
under their powerful shoulders, the boats
were making a pretty spectacle of it.
They were gaining in speed with, every
mile, and the Shamrock III was a long
mile astern when the Reliance whirled
about the mark and towering stretches
of canvas broke and bellied out from her
spinnaker pole and over her lee bow
The homeward stretch had begun The
boats were timed at the turn as follows:

continued to carry it. . For three-quarters
of an hour the only variation was a slow
gain by the leading boat.
After an hour's turn offshore they
sailed toward Long Branch for a half
hour. Captain Barr attempted, to make a
hitch offshore, but the Shamrock would
not follow, and he took the Reliance
around again to keep her company'. Mean
while the Reliance had steadily gained,
and when at 3:10 o'clock both. boats head
ed off to the, mark, six miles away, the
Reliance was a good mile ahead and
gaining. I
For more than an hour they sailed on
that tack down past the shore of Sandy
Hook and the highlands of Navesink to
Seabright, and during all that time the
Reliance steadily worked up to windward
of the beaten challenger, outpointing and
outfootlng her at the same time, and
passed to windward of her. When they
tacked off Seabright, heading i seaward,
the American boat had gained a quarter
of a mile straight .to , windward of the
British craft. On this new. tack Captain
Wrlnge again gave his boat a good full,
and she cut through the. Reliance's gain
at an alarming gait, but all to no pur
pose. Pinched into the wind or with a
rapful, the Shamrock was hopelessly out

They went off at a swift 'Â¦' pace In a

romp away at a fast clip, while Captain
Barr pinched the Reliance close to the
wind and cleverly nursed her toward the
turning mark. The Shamrock - at first
footed faster, but the Reliance more than
made it good by outpointing her.

Ten minutes later, -when both boats were

Captain i Barr prevented the Shamrock

COMPANY'S ULTIMATUM.
When President Fordorer of the City
Trustees asked Attorney Shea of the
Fouthprn Pacific what was the company's
answer to the Question whether it would
accept the franchises for twenty-five
J ears Mr. Shea, replied:
Â¦ The Southern Pacific â¢will not takÂ« the fran
chises tor any time less than the unexpireJ
Â¦terms of tho corporate existence of the roads,
..thfrty-three years for the old South Pacific
line, and forty-five years fcr the old Central
Pacific Iln*. Mr. Kruttschnitt wants no stip
ulation put in the franchises regarding the
riKinir* of freight trains through Alameda or
concerning freight rates. The company in
. tends to divert all freight on the South Pacific
'.Coast line Tram San I>orenzo to a point on
the Idles linÂ» near Fitchburg and then into
Oakland and across the Harrison-etreet bridge
tÂ« the yards to be established at Alameda
â¢ Point.
Here City Trustee Dr. Pond asked Shea.
"Al-.e you prepared to repeat before this
body the ultimatum you made us Mon-
Viay, that if we did not give the Southern
â¢ Pacific a franchise on the south side road
â¢the- company will pull off its trains and
â¢discontinue the service?"
Â¦' :-;.Â¦:â¢ a answered: "Unless we get these
" franchises on our own conditions we will
withdraw the applications and shut down
'the south eide line. That is the situation.
If you want to give us the franchise you
: can. Jf yÂ«u do not the railroad company
. -docs not care two cents. I believe that
the people of this town are willing to
â¢>'!ve us the franchises for fifty years. Af
ter they were granted we would hear no
rnqre about the matter except from a few
â¢1'ark street kickers."
Afterw ard the City Trustees and the
I executive committee of the citizens' com
" mittee held a brief executive session, and
PresUent Forderer informed Shea that
" the City Trustees were opposed to grant
ing the franchises for more than twenty
. BvÂ« years. The attorney remarked:
"If. that is the result you may as well
â¢ quit right here. I can tell you now that
Â¦ s-uch terms will not be accepted by us."
WILL HOLD CONFERENCE.
City Trustee Pond then moved that the
<"ity Trustees confer personally with
Manager Kruttschnitt, and the conference
â¢ adjourned.
' -At a meeting of the Board of Trade
Held to-night and attended by thirty-five
â¢â¢ people $1CO was raised to secure an at
torney to obtain an injunction prevent
Â¦ ing the City Trustees from granting the
Southern Pacific the local franchise for
a' long term of years and without com
pensation. Speakers at the meeting were

. jors. Halavor Hauch_ F. W. Vogt and

ALAMEDA, Sept. 3^-Reprcscnting the
Southern Pacific Company, Attorney-
Frank Shea to-night demanded of the
City Trustees that if the franchises were
to be granted his corporation to operate
the two local roads the privileges be given
;vn tho "north side lino for forty-five years
and on the south side system for thirty
three years, the lrr.gth of the unexpired
terms of the corporate existence of the
respective roads. Shea's demand was re
fused by the City Trustees, the majority
bclif.ving that twenty-five years should
be the life limit of the franchises. To
irtbrrow afternoon at 3 o'clock the mu
nicipal legislators will hold a conference
In San Francisco with General Manager
Julius Kruttschnitt of the Southern Pa
cific and endeavor to settle the franchise
matter on a 25-yc-ar basis.

Mooney has, it is said, worked at cross
purposes with President Mitchell ever
since before the Pittsburg, Kans., con
ference two months ago, when Mitchell
went so far as to tell Mooney to sit
down and keep still. In any event, the
situation in the TCovinger district prom
ises to supply an interesting fight. Now
that the' miners there have violated the
agreement reached by President Mitchell
and the miners at Chicago recently, the
operators say. they will make no effort to
conciliate the strikers. The operators,
furthermore, have told the national board'
of the United Mine Workers that they
expect the board to control its own men
and that if they fall to do so they will be
unable to deal with the officers of the
national organization at the Kansas City
conference .next week, when, it was
hoped, all differences would be wiped out.
Thus the situation has developed Into
a question of authority. If the men still
refuse to work after Vice President Lewis
of Bridgeport, Â¦ Ohio, who has been sent
into the field by President Mitchell, talks
with the strikers, the next move. It is
said, "may be the suspension of Mooney
and the local unions Involved.
KANSAS CITY, Sept. 3.â James Mooney,

HONOL.UL.U, Sept 3.â The Federal au
thorities have been working for many
months to break up the trade In Japanese
women, who are brought here practically
as slaves. For some time past the of
ficers have been endeavoring to learn the
secret of the remarkable operations of
the men engaged In this traffic and have
just been rewarded by the discovery of
an organization of extraordinary scope
which has existed among resort proprie
tors in these Islands for a long time. The
organization la a secret one, regularly or
ganized, with a president and an execu
tive board and with a set of by-laws.
The Federal officers by careful watch
ing managed to locate the headquarters of
the society and seized among other things
a complete set of books, showing the
status of the association In all Its phases.
Among the books is a membership roll,
with a complete list of the members of
the society. Another book, and probably
the most important of those seized, shows
that the society has a fund of large pro
portions devoted to the defense of mem
bers arrested for conducting the Illicit
trade and giving in some detail the re
ceipts and expenditures of the society.
The officials are highly pleased with the
discovery and with the aid of the books
expect to bring many of the guilty mem
bers of the society Into court and to even
tually break up the business of the asso
ciation.

"Mr." Chairman, fellow delegates of the
Union Labor party convention: Has San
Francisco suffered by the election of a
Union Labor Mayor two years ago? (Cries
EGAH'S RETROSPECT.
Alfred Roncovierl, chairman of the
committee on platform and resolutions,
was given a hearty reception when he
ascended the steps to read the party's
platform. He was interrupted through
out the reading by the applause of the
delegates.
G. G. Vickerson, John J. Smith, Wins
low D. Getchell and John J. Connelly
were nominated for vice presidents and a
roll call developed the following vote by
districts:
Twenty-eighth, Vickerson and Smith;
Twenty-ninth, Vickerson and Smith;
Thirtieth, Connolly and Smith; Thirty
first, "Vickerson and Smith; Thirty-sec
ond, Vickerson and Smith; Thirty-third,
Connolly and Smith; Thirty-fourth, Vick

Chairman Williams announced the vote,
as follows: l
Vickerson, 130; Smith, 144; Connolly,
80; Getchell,. 25.
Messrs. Vickerson and Smith were in
vited to the platform and expressed their
pleasure for the honor accorded them.
Nominations for Mayor were next in
order.
Tom Egan ascended the platform amid
the cheers of hla friends. 'His speech
nominating Eugene E. Schmitz -was in
terrupted time and again with cheers and
when he concluded '.the delegates rose
to their feet and yelled themselves hoarse
for their standard bearer. Egan spoke
as follows:
PLATFORM READ.
' "Your committee further recommends
that after the nomination for Mayor shall
have been made this convention adjourn
to await the report of said committee on
Supervisors and as soon as sold report
shall be ready reconvene at the call of
the chair."
MAYOR TAKES PLATFORM.
At the conclusion of De Succa's speech
Mayor Schmitz strode toward the plat
form. As soon as his presence was dis
covered every delegate sprang to his feet
and swung his hat and cheered loudly for
his leader. The cheering lasted fully two
minutes and when order was restored
nominations for Mayor were closed and
upon motion of Delegate Egan the Mayor
was nominated by acclamation. As the
vote was cast by the secretary of the
convention, every delegate arose to his
feet and cheered. There were cries for
Schmitz and he accepted the calls for a
speech by speaking as follows:
"Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen of the Con
vention and Friends: I hardly know how
to express my gratitude for the honor
that has been paid me this evening in re
ceiving at your hand3 unanimously the
renomination for the office which I hold
at the present time and hold as a repre
sentative of the Union Labor party. (Ap
plause.) It clearly demonstrates more
than anything else could that my efforts
in behalf of the people, who have had the
courage to select me as their standard
bearer, have been sincere and honest and
that my administration. If not all what
was expected, has at least been better
for the wage-earners, better for the good
people than any one of the millionaire
nominees who have held the position
(Applause.) There i3 no more fitting place
to receive a nomination from the hands
of the Union Labor party than in this
temple, dedicated to labor. (Applause.)
As I have often said during my last cam
paign, the Union Labor party does not be
lieve in putting one class against another
and it does not believe in taking radical
action on any proposition. I have stated
during my last campaign, and I reiterate
to-night, that I believe in equal and fair
consideration for . capital and equal and
Just representation for labor, and I have
endeavored on every occasion to try to
show that I mean to carry out those
principles in future as well as carry them
out by word of mouth. (Applause.)
"I started out to make many reforma
tions, but have not been able to accom
plish all that I had expected to on ac
count of the obstacles that I have found
on every side which I had to surmount.
I had to go into office with a Board of
Supervisors not sympathetic to me or at
all in accord with my desires for reform,
which I have often expressed and have
tried to put into effect I found the board
composed of men who had been placed
In office before me and also antagonistic
to every proposition that I might put
forward, and It Is only at the present time
that some of them have been In the ma
jority for this administration. That is
one reason why I desire to be re-elected,
because I want, to put into positive ef
fect the good work that I mapped out
at the beginning of my term and I found
myself unable to carry out by reason of
the opposition I have met on all sides.
(Applause.) *
"The opposition newspapers^ when I was
I escorted him to the platform of Metro
politan Temple and urged the delegates
present to put their shoulders to the
wheel and make his nomination equiva
lent to an election, which they did. It
was my pleasure during the campaign to
tell the voters of San Francisco that the
Union Labor party had nominated one of
the grandest and most popular young
men in the affections of the good people
of San Francisco, that could be nomin
ated by any convention. (Applause.) I
was right and his large majority of 5000
over his Republican opponent and 10,000
over hia Democratic opponent proved it
(Applause.) I also told them that he was
a young man who had already distin
guished himself in his chosen profession
and would surely distinguish himself as
Mayor of San Francisco if elected. How
well he has done so you have been told
by the previous speaker. He has fully
met the expectations of his friends and
ho has ably captured his enemies by his
immense popularity. I also told them ho
was a young man of unblemished reputa
tion, possessed of executive abilities of
high order."
igo I- was among the first to congratu
late him upon his nomination for Mayor.
MAYOR B. E. SCHMITZ, RE
NOMINATED BY UNION LA
BOR PARTY, AND FRIENDS.
"I heartily indorse the renomination of
Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz for Mayor of
San Francisco. (Applause.). Two years
"Fellow .delegate's of the convention, I
now take great pleasure In placing his
name before you^for the nomination for
Mayor, conscious of his work and mind
ful of your appreciation of the splendid
claim upon your consideration of Eugene
E. Schmitz." (Tremendous cheering.)
When the cheering had subsided James
de Succa took the platform to second the
nomination. His greeting was also a cor
dial one. Mr. de Succa delivered a very
lengthy address, which was full of praise
and metaphor.- In part he spoke as fol
lows: .
"Who can deny these facts? Does any
one pretend to deny that the present
peaceful industrial conditions now pre
vailing in our city are due to the fact
that we have as the chief executive of
San Francisco a man who deals to all
classes even-handed justice (applause)
and who in the conduct of his daily of
ficial life practices that line of conduct
which can be summed up in his chosen
motto, 'Equal rights to all and special
privileges to none?' (Great applause.)
"Fellow delegates, I feel honored by
being a member of this convention, and I
feel doubly honored by having the op
portunity to present to you for your in
dorsement the name of our j present
Mayor, Eugene E. Schmitz. (Tremendous
ceering.) .
"He cornea ; be fore you at this time to
render an account of his. stewardship as
the labor Mayor. For that matter, he
comes before the whole people of San
Francisco to render an account of his
stewardship as Mayor of this city of his
birth. (Applause.) Never has San Fran
cisco had a better Mayor. (Applause.)
And never has labor had a more conser
vative, able or wise leader. (Applause.)
"Two years ago, fellow delegates of the
convention, we came before the people of
San Francisco with his candidacy as an
experiment. We go before the people now
and we offer to the entire community
the demonstrated proposition that not
only has San Francisco not suffered by
the election of a labor Mayor, but that

PRESENTS SCHMITZ'S 1TAME.
of "No! No!") Fellow delegates of the
convention, you are all familiar with the
causes leading up to the organization of
tho Union Labor party of San Francisco
in 1901. You are all familiar with the
unfortunate conditions which prevailed in
our beloved city two years ago â condi
tions brought about and aggravated by
the misuse of Kovernmental . powers by
those in charge of our municipality. You
will all recollect how the powere of gov
ernment were used to crush those strug
gling for a betterment of their condition
and for some slight measure of the pros
perity coming to the community. I will
not at this time indulge in any recital
of those conditions or of the wrongs and
injustices practiced by those officials se
lected to serve you and the citizens of
San Francisco. That is trite history now.
Suffice it to say that they were sufficient
to bring aoout the organization of our
party. You will all recollect how the
prejudice existed at that time against the
movement, both by friends and enemies
of laborâ the friends of labor fearing a
bad effect upon the cause of labor and
the enemies of labor predicting absolute
ruin to San Francisco in the event of
our success. We had to combat in our
own ranks and on all sides we had to
defend ourselves. Despite all these fears,
oppositions and misgivings, we proceeded
along what appeared to be our duty. We
met. We nominated a ticket. We se
lected as our standard bearer our present,
our honored Mayor, Eugene E. Schmitz.
(Great cheering.)
"And we triumphantly elected him. (Ap
plause.) What has been the result? In
dustrial peace, happiness and prosperity
to all classes. Never has San Francisco
been more prosperous. Upon every side is
evidence of increasing growth and pros
perity. Business enterprises flourish;
commercial activity Is ever, on the in
crease. Real estate transactions exceed
those of any other period In our city's
history; magnificent and impsoing struc
tures rising on our business thoroughfares
and workmen busy upon the little homes
of the poor. (Applause.)
SUMS TJP RESTJI/T.
"In view of the necessity for careful and
prudent'action in the matter of the selec
tion of candidates for the Board of Su
pervisors and in order that the strongest
and best possible ticket may be presented
to the people of San Francisco, we fur
ther recommend that a special committee
of eighteen be appointed by the chair,
one from' each Assembly district, to can
vass all names which may be presented
or suggested for the office of Supervisor,
and to reoprt to this convention the
names recommended to thorn as tho
strongest and best candidates' for that of
fice. Such report to have no effect" unless
approved by a majority report of this
convention.
"It shall be the duty of this committee
to adopt such measures and to take such
steps as will secure the largest registra
tion of members of our party who have
not registered and the registration of
those who have changed their residences
since their last registration.
"Registration closes on September 23,
1903. We therefore also further recom
mend that every member of this conven
tion also use his best efforts toward the
same end.
"We further recommend that a special
committee of eighteen be appointed by
the chair, one from each Assembly dis
trict, to act as a committee on registra
tion.
speeches, be limited to five minutes; that
all resolutions shall be referred to the
committee on resolutions without debate;
that at least 100 votes, being a majority
of all the delegates elected to this con
vention, shall be required to make any
nomination; that all nominations shall be
accompanied by the payment of the sum
of $10, except nominations for Supervisors,
which shall bo accompanied by the pay
ment of the sum of $5, said sums to be de
posited with the secretary of the conven
tion and to be used for the purpose of
defraying the current expenses of holding
this convention.
- "AH parliamentary questions and rules
of .orders not otherwise herein provided
for shall be governed by Roberts' Rules
of Order. . .
"Our platform two years ago pledged
the Mayor and Supervisors to save at
least $100,000 a year by cutting down the
high salaries paid some men in the City
Hall. On two occasions, living up to that
platform, I have brought vetoes to the
budget and demonstrated beyond a per
adventure of a doubt that more than
$100,000 could be saved, but there again I
did not have the support of a sympathetic
board and fifteen Supervisors stood
against me and overrode the veto of those
items which I pledged my party to car
ry out. CApplause.)
"It cannot be charged by anybody that
the Labor party has been a failure. (Ap
plause.) It cannot be charged on any
hand that the condition of San Francisco
is worse to-day that It was two years
ago. On the contrary, there has been
more business transacted in San Francis
co in the last two years than in the -five
preceding years. (Applause.) And the
wage earner's condition to-day is a great
deal better than it was two year3 ago,
and I say to you in all earnestness and
sincerity that the perpetuation of this
party must be assured if that great class
of good people hope to get representation,
hope to have their condition continue to
improve and if they hope to place men
in office who will not be subservient to
any bosses. *â¢-Â¦" . "Â¦ 'â¢%_Â¦'
"I thank you for this nomination. I in
dorse, standing here- to-n!ght. your plat
form and I want to say that I will do
everything in my power to carry your en
tire ticket to victory, to carry, it to suc
cess at the next election, and -on all sides*
I want it to be known that I am first, last
and always a a representative of the
Union Labor party and shall always be.
(Enthusiastic applause.) Â¦ ' .Â«
"I thank you, brother?, for this great
honor you have conferred upon me to
night. It is something that any man
will be proud of. There are no words
in the Engliah language that I am mas
ter of to express to you In full the deep
regard and appreciation that I have tor.
tendering me unanimously the renomlna
tion for the office I now hold. I hope in
the future I will m^rit your good will and
I assure you I will endeavor to do so,
and no act of mine will ever bring dis
credit on the wage earners of this city or
upon the people who are willing to sup-,
port me again for the office I now hold.
I thank you." (Great cheering.)
Chairman Williams. was empowered to
appoint a committee of eighteen to re
ceive nominations for Supervisors and re
port back at the next session of the co. - "
ventlon. Mayor Schmitz was empowered
to open his campaign immediately. An
adjournment was then taken to the- call
of the chair. . ...
"Every success that I have made has
not filled me with pride and pleasure for
my own sake, but it has filled me with
pride because I realized that whatever
I did was taken as a mark of what other
labor men could do and reflected not upon
myself as an individual, but â¢ reflected
upon the people who placed me in office â
upon the wage earners of San Francisco
(great applause) whose representative I
am now and whose representative I al
ways hope to be (applause).
"I know you will pardon me for refer
ring to that trial which came up about
three months after I went into office. I
mean the street railway strike. At that
time it was also Bald: 'We'll see now how
the labor man handles a difficulty of this
magnitude.' Well, without taking any
credit upon myself, I want to say that I
had an opportunity at that time to dem
onstrate that I was sincere in the remarks
and speeches I made before election, that
I would give equal rights to all and spe
cial privileges to none. (Applause.) And
that strike was settled without bloodshed.
Why? Because Justice was dealt out equal
ly to all and the men who went out on strike
realized that they had nothing to fear In
the way of Injustice of any kind-. And
they themselves formed themselves into
a peace committee to protect the property
of the company and carried on the strike
to a successful determinationâ a strike
that has never been equaled In the world
up to the present time. ;
"I stated before last election that I be
lieved in peaceful measures at all haz
ards in the settlement of industrial dis
turbances and I have proven, dozens of
times that this Is the best way, by. having
the employers and employes meet In my
office. I have managed to get them to
gether and although I have seen them
look daggers at each other, after a calm
discussion I have seen them leave my
office arm. in arm and settle their differ
ences. (Applause.)

on board, reached the petroleum tanks
on Sunday and caused a terrlilc explo

The crew took to the boat3 during a
violent storm. One boat with six occu
pants drifted away and was not seen aft

swamped in the high seas.
The weather continued so bad that the
survivors in the other boats took refuge
again on the Klampenborg on Monday

THE Union Labor party of the city and comity of San Francisco, In local cÂ«n
vantion assembled, presents the following platform- and declaration of prin
ciples, upon which It appeals to the voters of San Francisco for the support
of its nominees, and It hereby pledges each of its candidates to carry out
these principles:
The Union Labor party is not a class party and does not Intend to establish
a class It Is true that on account of peculiar exigencies o< the po
litical situation It originated through the active efforts of a portion of our people,
but It embraces and seeks to comprehend in its membership all elements of our
population, irrespective of class, creed or station. It is essentially the party of
the plain peopleâ the party of those who are benefited by co-operation for the
protection and maintenance of their political rights. And while it respects and
protects the rights of all. It la at the samo time designed to â¢ secure effectively
for the wage earner, for the small taxpayer, for tho larger mass of our citizen
ship, the rights and privileges to whioh under, the law they are legitimately en
titled and which heretofore havo only too frequently bÂ«en enjoyed by the few.
It stands for the peaceful advancement of the masses and for the betterment
of their material, social and political conditions, and looks forward to fair and
equal consideration and protection of capital and labor, employer and employe,
alike.
Its motto is, "Equal rights to all and special privileges to none."
When the people of San Francisco at the last municipal election manifested
their confidence in the declarations of the Union Labor party and their faith In
its professions by electing to the highest office of the municipality ' the Hon. Eu
gene E. Schmitz, the present Mayor of our . groat city, their action was looked
upon by some with misgivings, approhcnsioi.i and fear, but we point with pride
to the manly, conservative and Just record of our chief executive, whose per
sonal Integrity and ability are recognized and commended by the citizens of San
Francisco without regard to party affiliation. â
He has fulfilled every pledge made by him or by his party on his behalf.
Though surrounded by many obstacles, he has endeavored to cut down extrava
gant and unnecessary salaries and to reduce the number of high-priced and
fancy employes in the city's administration, and to that end has twice vetoed ap
propriations of over $100,000 for those purposes, which vetoes, unfortunately, were
not sustained by the JBoard of Supervisors.
During his term of office all differences .between labor and capital, employer
and employe, have been adjusted satisfactorily to both sides, and without vio
lence and bloodshed. He has proven himself capable, honest and fair In all his
dealings toward all classes of i our citizens, ' and we cordially and emphatically
indorse his administration. >
VTe pledge all our nominees to an economical and businesslike administration
of the city's affairs.
We favor the expenditure of more of the money raised by taxation for perma
nent public Improvements and for the repair and improvement of our streets, and
the expenditure of less money for extravagant salaries or ornamental and un
necessary employes. â¢- - â¢-â¢>
We pledge them also to liberal and fair treatment of our public schools, and
favor the erection 'of new'school buildings and better school accommodations for
the children of our city. We commend and indorse the present system of ap
pointment of teachers to the School Department of this city, by competitive ex
amination among the holders of certificates and the appointment of those who
successfully pass the examinations in the order of their standing in such exam
inations.
We believe the best Interests of education require that the School Depart
ment be entirely divorced from politics and that advancement depend upon
merit alone, to the exclusion of political and personal favoritism, and we
pledge our nominees to carry out these principles.
Furthermore, we recommend that all Asiatics, both Chinese and Japanese,
should be educated separately from the other children in schools exclusively
for themselves.
We favor the acquisition and public ownership of all public utilities and
means of communication, such as public buildings, street railways, gas, elec
tric light, water, telephones and telegraphs. We regard the acquisition of a
public water supply and the operation by the municipality of the Geary-street
railway as of primary and especial importance. In the event of their acqui
sition we pledge our nominees to a progressive and economical, operation there
of.
We favor also the municipal ownership and operation of a complete tele
phone system. "We favor the Immediate construction of a new City and County
Hospital. The sick wards of the city should be housed in better quarters and
surrounded by better conditions than exist in the present ramshackle structures.
We demand that all supplies for the public- Institutions of this city and
county bear the union label where such can be provided and that goods of
home manufacture shall in all cases be given preference.
We demand the rigid enforcement of the laws calling for licensed engineers
and firemen to be in charge of steam boilers and engines operated in the city
and county of San Francisco to the end that life and property be not endan
gered by reckless or incompetent operation of such plants.
We pledge our nominees for Mayor and for Supervisors that all work done
for the municipality shall be done by the day and not by contract, thereby se
curing for the city the best service at the least exDense.
\ We recommend the rigid enforcement of the eight-hour law as to all work
performed by or for this municipality. j
We demand that the street sweeping apparatus of this city be owned and
operated by the municipality. . i
We recognize that a necessity exists for a fund to carry on permanent Im
provements, such as repairing and repaving streets, reconstructing and extend
ing sewers, erecting new schoolhouses when necessary and other public work
that will be of benefit to the city at large and will give employment to labor.
We therefore pledge our candidate for Mayor and our nominees for the Board
of Supervisors to reserve a fund when making up the annual budget of at least
10 cents on each dollar raised by taxation, the Bame to be used for permanent
Improvements and to be designated as "municipal permanent Improvement
fund."
We further pledge our nominees for Mayor and Supervisors to dismiss all
unnecessary employes, so that a saving of at least $100,000 per annum can be
effected and the money thus saved devoted to permanent improvements.
We favor arbitration of all industrial disputes eo far as the same may be
just and practicable. - j
We favor the peaceful settlement of all differences between employer and
employe.
We favor the civil service system of public appointments as provided in our
charter.
The Police and Fire deportments shall be administered and conducted strict
ly In accordance with the law insuring the same protection to all.
We favor the absolute exclusion of all Asiatics, Japanese, as well as Chi
nese, and pledge our nominees If elected to use their influence and their best
efforts to seure such result.
Believing that the poll tax system now in existence unjustly discriminates
against the poor man Inasmuch as he pays a larger percentage in proportion
to his means and income than does his wealthy neighbor, we favor the aboli
tion of this unequal tax. We favor absolute home rule for the city and coun
ty of San Francisco and pledge our nominees and our party to work to that end
The interference by the Legislature with the internal affairs of San Fran
cisco, notwithstanding the charter, is costing our city much money and Is en
croaching upon her rights of self-government.
We favor a constitutional amendment which shall make it impossible for
State boards of equalization arbitrarily to raise the assessment of this city, al
ready overassessed, especially as regards its smaller property holders.
We also favor such changes in the laws as will place the water front of
San Francisco under the control of the municipal government, so that the ad
ministration of the water front may be conducted more with a view to the
commercial advancement and prosperity of the city than as an asylum for the
political refugees of the State who are strangers to San Francisco not inter
ested In its welfare and Ignorant of its needs.
We deplore the interference by the courts In the executive affairs of the
city and the abuse of the writ of injunction to restrain the action of public
officials honestly attempting to do their whole duty by the people and by such
injunction enabling Incompetent or dishonest men to hold themselves In pub
lic position in defiance of the acts of their executive superiors and of the will
of the people. .
imous vote the delegates acclaimed
Eugene E. Schmitz the nominee. The
candidate made another of his character
istic speeches. As the audience was com
posed almost exclusively of Union Labor
representatives the Schmitz taffy was
abundantly bestowed on wage earn
ers. The smoothness of the convention's
proceedings attracted the attention of
spectators. The platform of principles
was adopted without amendment or de
bate. The order of business, presenting
some departures from established . usage,
was accepted without dissent. The dele
gates will not come together again until
the chairman gives the signal. During
the recess a committee of eighteen will
cast about for suitable material for the
Board of Supervisors. No doubt the list
of the proposed nominees will be sub
mitted to the candidate for Mayor.
There, are no signs of vigorous contest
for subordinate places on the ticket, such
as County Clerk, Sheriff, Recorder and
Public Administrator. An olive branch
was tendered last night to the defeated
delegates of the Casey wing of the party.
They were Invited to wear delegate
badges and grace the occasion with their
presence. . . '.;
The distinction of placing Mayor
Schmitz in nomination was accorded to
Thomas F. Egan and James de Succa. If
Chris Buckley had been present he would
have listened with pride to his former
lieutenant, for Mr. Egan made a happy
speech. James de Succa's eloquence In

LABOR AND ADMISSION DAYS.
The board of directors of the. San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company has is
sued a call for a meeting of shareholders
to be held at its offices, 415 street,
Thursday. October 22, for the purpose of
acting upon a voting proposition to cre
ate a bonded indebtedness of $10,000,000
for the purpose of paying for the proper
ties recently acquired, including the Inde
pendent Gas and Power Company, the In
dependent Electric . Light and Power
Company, the Equitable Gas Light Com
pany and the Pacific Gas Improvement
Company.
The circular to the shareholders sets
forth that in order to popularize the com
pany with the public and to obtain and
maintain its good will a rate of $1 per
thousand feet has been made for gas, a
price which the company will endeavor
to continue, although the legal rate is
$1 20.
Speaking yesterday, of the forthcoming
meeting of shareholders Allan Pollok,
manager of the company, said:
The Jl per 1000 cubic feet gas puts San

Owners. of property in the vicinity of
Grant avenue from Bush street to Mar
ket will be disagreeably interested in a
decision rendered yesterday by United
States District Judge James H. Beatty
of Idaho sitting in the United States Cir
cuit Court in the case of Alexander J.
Swift against" the city and county of San
Francisco. The suit was brought to re
cover $3000 and interest on the Dupont
street widening bondg. Judge Beatty
gave judgment in favor of Swift, but
added that the amount of the judgment
was not payable out of the general fund,
but that it should be assessed against and
collected from the owners of property in
the district benefited by the widening of
Dupont street from Bush to Market and
constituting what is now known as
Grant avenue.
Six other cases of a similar nature pend
ing in the United States Circuit Court are
included in "Judge Beatty's decision, the
facts In each and the questions of law
involved being alike. The plaintiffs are
James S. Sharper, 'Felix J. de Crano, Jo
seph W. Mather. E. G. Ames. Henry A.
King and Ellen Ivers, and the aggregate
sum Involved in the seven suits is $113,
000, "of which $70,000 is for principal on the
bonds and the remainder for interest. All
the plaintiffs are residents oV the Eastern
States and their claims are not affected
by the decisions heretofore given in the
Superior Court in favor of the city and
county and the property owners.
The complainants will proceed to man
damus the Assessor and the Tax Col
lector to assess to and collect from the
property owners the sura involved ln the
decision. Should they still refuse to pay
their property will be sold to pay the as
sessment.
The bonds for thc widening of Dupont
street were^-authprized by "an act of the
Legislature of March, 1876, and .the work
of widening the street from Bush to Mar
ket was completed In the fall of 1877. The
bonds were issued" for $1,000,000, of wjilch
sum $800,000 has been paid, leaving $200,
000 due. Of this balance due the Eastern
holders will receive $70,000, plus interest,
which will bring the total up to $113,000.

J. H. Pease told of a coffin falling out
of a hearse that broke down on the road.
The coffin lay in the roadway for two
hours until another hearse was secured.
The Board of Works Informed the com
mittee that there Is only $7505 available
for the repair of county roads and all
this money could not be used on Mission
road. Commissioner Schmitz suggested
that the City Engineer be asked for an
estimate of cost to put the road in tem
porarily good condition, but action was
postponed until Commissioner Manson's
return.
Stanley Fay was granted a permit to
pave Linden avenue, between Webster
and Buchanan streets. The City Street
Improvement Company, which had se
cured the signatures of some of the prop

application, with the understanding that
they should be charged the same price as
those who had signed with Fay.
Owen McHugh was allowed until March

Arraigned for Murder.
One of the most important cases now
pending in the criminal courts is that
against Charles Sullivan and J. H.
Powell, who were arraigned before Po
lice Judge Mogan yesterday charged
with murdering Special Policeman Robert
A. Sample. The murder was a cold-blood
ed one, and it occurred on Howard street,
between First and Second, on the
morning of August 11. The prisoners had
been in a drunken brawl with an un
known man, it is said, whom they were
beating unmercifully. Martin " Kelly
called Sample's attention to the fact that
the outrage was going on, whereupon the
special sought- to stop the beating. It is
said that Sullivan and Powell beat the
policeman, then took his revolver away
from him and phot him in cold blood
while he lay helpless and bleeding on the
sidew/alk. The case is one of exceeding
cruelty and cold-bloodedness, but despite
this fact it is taid that certain political
influences are being used in behalf of the
prisoners. The case will come up to-day

however, can only be done by the co-operation

The Joint committee meeting of the
Board of Supervisors held yesterday aft
ernoon for the purpose of Investigating the
action Â«>f the Board of Health In raising
!Â»A^nrlÂ»>Â» of employes with money appro
priated, for additional help did not de
velop any sensational features^ Secretary
J. P. Emery of the Health Board ap
peared before the Supcrvtaora and
smoothed matters over,' HÂ« informed
the members that the Board of Health
did not go outside of lta province, "nor
did It Intend to do anything that would
lcok like a discourtesy to the city fathers.
Emery proved a good molllfler and suc
ceeded In making things look In a. better
light than was first reported.
The facts show that I65.5S0. was appro
priated for the use of the Health Board
for this year. It was provided that "the
board could employ two additional mar
ket Inspectors, one additional sanitary
Inspector and one additional plumbing In
spector. It developed that the Health
Board employed an additional Banltary
inspector and an assistant city physician,
and had divided $2*50 in raising employes"
saladles as follows: Chief sanitary inspect,
or $609, health officer 5200, assistant sec
retary $300. messenger $1SO, chemist $300,
chemist's helper 5120, bacteriologist $300,
bakery Inspector $300 and disinterring lnj
spector $120.
EMERY EXPLAINS.
This was added to their annual sala
ries. As the money was appropriated for
new positions and not for raising sala
ries some of the Supervisors thought that
the Health Board had overstepped its
authority.
Emery was interrogated closely about
the number of employes in the depart
ment and their duties. After the exam
ination Emery asked leave to make a
statement, and upon leave being granted
him he said:
"Different conditions existed when the
salaries were made and fixed. The board
did not desire to step outside of the rec
ommendation of your committee. It be
lieved it was acting under the resolution
introduced by Supervisor Wilson, which
says that 'any determination of the
budget and the aggregate sum allowed
each department, office or commission,
the itemized segregation of the finance
Committee and the committee of the
whole, shall In no instance be 8 recom
mendation or limitation as to the dispo
sition of the appropriation finally made
to any department, office, board or com
mission, except in cases where the Board
of Supervisors, by ordinance or resolution,
as provided by the charter, has fixed the
compensation of subordinates.' "
Supervisor Wilson asked Emery wheth
er he thought the Board of Health had
shown respect to the Supervisors In using
money asked for additional help In rais
ing salaries. Emery replied that no dis
respect was Intended. He thought the
whole matter devolved on the Board of
Health, and it was in its discretion what
It should do with the money; that the
board might deem It proper to use the
money asked for the employment of a cer
tain inspector and do away with that of
fice and use It for some other purpose.
QUESTION OF JUDGMENT.
Supervisor Braunhart was of the opin
ion that the Health Board had such au
thority.'
Supervisor D'Ancona, who conducted
the Investigation, said there was no ques
tion that the Health Board did not In
tend any disrespect to the Supervisors.
He said the only question was whether
the money was used for the best interests
of the people in public service. The Board
of Health found itself with J25S0 avail
able. The question is, did the Health
Board show good judgment in' raising the
salaries of its employes?
After a great deal of informal discus
sion the committee took the matter un
der advisement.
The Finance Committee held a meeting
and decided to report favorably on the
claim of the Pacific Foundry Company
for $1145 for putting up the poles used in
the late Grand Army Encampment. Su
pervisor Wilson grew technical over the
matter. He thought the specifications
had not been complied with, but It was
shown to his satisfaction that certain
contingencies arose which made it im
possible to carry them out. Good faith
was shown on the part of the contractors
and the bill was ordered paid.
The Supervisors* Street CommltreÂ© met
yesterday and resumed consideration of
the epoMcation of tie Southern Paclflo
Company for a franchise for a. steam
road along thÂ» bay shore. No definite
conclusion^ was arrived at by the com
mittee beyond flatly declaring that thÂ«
proposed ordinance granting the fran
chises will positively be presented to the
Board of Supervisors for action pro or
con on Monday, September f 1*. 1903. In
order to prepare the bill the oommlttes
decided to meet next Thursday morning
at 11 o'clock to conclude deliberations on
all phases of the proposed right of way.
Chief Counselor Herrin of the South
ern Pacific Company appeared before the
committee and stated that the construc
tion of tha Fifth-street vladuot aa rec
ommended by City Engineer Grunsky Is
out of the question, claiming that it will
be Impracticable at the present time to
build It at the point designated by the
City Engineer. Herrin held that the por
tion of the franchise along Islets Creek
and the Mission tracks could be consid
ered alone and independent of the main
franchise.
"The Southern Pacific Company wishes
the matter considered," said Herrin, "but
the company desires a franchise that will
be acceptable."
"The committee wishes to recommend
the franchise," said Supervisor Braun
hart, "but the matter has been pending
for one year with no definite agreement
on the part of the company regarding cer
tain conditions suggested by the City En
gineer. The question of the removal of
the Mission tracks should be considered
at the present time."
NO TRAINS IN MISSION.
"The Mission branch of the road," said
Herrin," could be converted in about two
years into an underground system, but
this would be useless, as the company
will not run trains over the Mission tracks
when the bay shore railroad is com
pleted."
Herrin further stated that he would not
insist on the Islals Creek matter being
considered, and the committee decided
that Citv Engineer Grunsky shall meet
Chief Engineer Hood of the Southern Pa
cific Company to see if they can come to
some agreement. The Question of the
rental of the Market place lots which
the company desires to use In connection
with thf bay shore right of way will be
finally determined by the committee at
its next meeting. Herrin said that he
and the City Engineer had agreed that
$500 a month was a fair rental for the
property.
Braunhart held that it is the duty of
the committee to present an ordinance
proposing a grant of a franchise for twen
ty years, and Hrrrin said the representa
tives of the company will meet the com
mittee for the purpose of agreeing on the
terms of th<Â» ordinance.
Eugene Sullivan, on behalf of the Mis
sion residents, asked if the committee
had decided to grant the franchise only
in case the Southern Pacific Company
took up the Mission tracks. Chairman
Curtis replied that the committee had
not decided -on anything in connection
with the franchise, but that its desires
in the matter would be Incorporated in
the ordinance, which will be ready at Its
meeting next Thursday. At that time
the companv will be at liberty to inter
pose its objections to any of the provi
sions therein contained.
SANTA FE FRANCHISE.
Captain A. II. Payson, vice president
of the Atchlson. Topeka and Santa Fe
system, appeared before the committee in
support of the application for a franchise
on certain .portions of Seventeenth and
other streets. Payson asked that the
committee visit the route desired by the
company. The committee set next Tues
day afternoon at 4 o'clock as the time
for making a personal inspection of the
proposed right of way.
The committee prepared a resolution di
recting the Board of Works to remove
certain fences on P street. Railroad ave
nue and Twenty-seventh avenue, and to
expend $75 to make the necessary surveys.
George Bounds' stated that the Board
of .Works had been ordered to remove the
fences more than a year apo, but had only
partly carried out the work.
The petition of Roger Johnson to build
a sour track on Townsend street, be
tween Japan and Third, went over
for one week to give the committee an
opportunity to inspect the ground. Braun
hart thouzht that all permits for spur
tracks should require the use of grooved
girder rails. â¢

when he informed the Republican pa^ty of San

THE MAYOR'S SPEECH.
In the exhibit which California will make of
her vast natural and acquired resources at the St.
Louis exposition special attention will be given to
a display of our woods. In this field we should
particularly make a favorable impression, as there
is practically no question that we are the peer of
all American States in the variety of our woods.
Several soldiers and petty officers of the German
army have been arrested on a charge of selling some
of the army secrets of the Kaiser. Men involve them
selves in serious trouble sometimes for very little or
nothing.

Fire Destroys a ShinglÂ© Mill.
ST. HELENS, Ore., Sept. 3.-Nordby
& Olson's shingle and saw mill at Rainier
was destroyed by fire last night. The
fire started in the dryhouse and spread
to the mill. The shingle mill had a ca
pacity of 120,000 shingles a day and em
ployed thirty-five or forty hands. One
million two hundred thousand shingles
were also destroyed. The loss Is about

As stated by the Secretary the productive capacity
of the American people is now equal to about $11,000,
006.000 annually. Of the total product we export
about $1,500,000,000 and import about $1,000,000,000
of merchandise, mainly non-competitive with our
home products. We therefore consume about 95 per
cent of all that we produce, and it is upon that fact
-our prosperity is largely based. It follows as an
easy deduction that if at any time we fail to consume
that large percentage of the annual domestic product
: we shall either have to find additional foreign mar
kets or undergo a period of over-production with the
consequent inevitable depression of industry. To
provide for obtaining foreign markets is therefore
one of the prime duties of the statesmanship of the
time.
Secretary Shaw put the case this way: The balance
\ of trade in our favor nearly equals and occasionally
exceeds that of all other favored nations on the map.
We sell $ 1, 000.000 .000 per annum to Europe and 20
per cent of the people of the world are consuming
about 75 per cent of our total exports. The United
Kingdom with only 3 per cent of the people of'the
worTd consumes about 40 per cent of our total sur
plus production. Those percentages of the world's
population cannot be relied upon to take always 75
iper cent of our increasing surplus product and ac
cordingly it is a plain business duty to begin to look
. .out" for new markets.
Having thus stated the problem the Secretary went
on to say there have been three solutions proposed.
â¢ Free traders recommend that we open our markets to
foreigners in the hope that the foreigners will return
'the compliment and open their markets to us. Reci
procity men suggest the adoption of a system of
'. international treaties by which, through an exchange
of; courtesies, we can get something from the foreign
er by giving something in return. Neither of those
â¢ solutions can be accepted, for by following either
. we should have to give more than we receive and lose
" more than we gain. However valuable foreign mar
â¢ kets may be, the home market is better.
To the third solution â tnat of expanding our for
"cign markers by building up our merchant marineâ
' the Secretary turns and finds it to be the only one
acceptable. He says: "If we ever secure the trade
â¢ cf the countries to which I have referred, we will
[ first secure regular lines of communication with these
. countries, and if we ever secure these lines assistance
must be afforded. Do not^misunderstand me. I am
[not mourning the defeat of any ship subsidy bill, but
.1 shall mourn exceedingly the defeat of a bill, if any
such shall ever be introduced, which, if enacted, would
â¢ insure regular lines of American ships, flying the
American flag and carrying American merchants and
commercial travelers with their wares and merchan
dise, the product of American labor, into those coun-
. tries to which I have referred. Such a bill must offer
special advantages to ships plying between our ports
and countries where our trade is undeveloped."
Such is the conclusion of the argument. Secretary
Shaw says the establishment of lines of merchant
vessels is "the only method" by which we shall ever
. get our share of the commerce of the wcrld. It is
: the method of oar rivals and we must adopt it or
lote the â¢ ,
: Solid as are the foundations of prosperity and
' bright as arc the prospects ahead, the situation is
â¢by no means as good as it might be. Just as our
-. .financial conditions could be improved by an elastic
â¢ currency, so our industrial and commercial condi
â¢tipns could be improved by the development of a deep
' sea merchant marine capable of extending and ex
..panding our foreign trade. THe two things then
â¢which we need at the present time in the way of
. national legislation arc a currency reform bill and a
â¢ merchant marine bill. Each is important and each
should be provided at the coming session of Con
â¢ gress.
: . â¢ Financially the condition of the country is sound,
ind the only defect is a lack of elasticity in the cur
: tcricy. ' The prosperity of trade and industry is as
"safe, apparently, as is the national treasury- The
iSecretary does not hesitate to say that there ex
â¢ ists. no element of immediate danger in any part
-of our complex business machinery, and that if any
â¢ panic or depression comes it will be due solely to
â¢some aberration of the public mind; or as the Sec
retary puts it: "If disaster comes it will be psycho
. .logical -and not logical. The microbe, if it exists, is in
the mind and net elsewhere."
s-y ECRETARY SHAW, in his address at Chicago
before the National Association of Merchants
. Vfcrf/ an( j Tra\ - elers, presented a review not only ot
â¢our finances, but of our foreign commerce as well.
The speech, therefore, is one of the most notable
:ihai has been made of late by a member of the Cab
"ij>et. and - will command the attention of the entire

pay chute in the old Maddux mine, near
Whisky town, and they are now consider,
ably elated over the splendid showing 1
that has just been made in this famous
mine, on which they have a working
bond.
The Maddox mine is 6ituated on Mad
dox Creek, a branch of Whisky Creek,
and Is about five miles from Whisky
town. Operations began on the property
twenty-five or thirty years ago, and the
original locator of the claim took out
over $10,000 in three days, using an old
fashioned horse arrastra. The chute was
encountered In a drift sixty feet In on the
lower level and 600 feet below the apex,
which is S00 feet below the old workings
of the mine. The ore carries an average
value of $600 per ton and the body Is ex
tensive, the pay chute averaging over
two feet In width.

The capture of the peace congress is looked upon
as a part of the general Socialistic propaganda which
is now progressing in all parts of the East and which
has become strong enough to constitute a genuine
political force in New England, New York, Pennsyl
vania, New Jersey and Illinois. In reviewing their
work the Philadelphia Public Ledger says: "The prop
agandists work chiefly among the laboring men, es
pecially in the mining and manufacturing centers;
they do not confine their efforts of perversion to
the ordinary political campaign periods, but main
tain their pernicious activity throughout the year,
holding small meetings or pressing their opinions
upon little groups of workingmen, or even seeking
out individual voters to induce them to accept the
Socialistic creed. Latterly they have carried cam
paigning into the agricultural districts, sending their
spellbinders to the farmers' social gatherings to dis
seminate their doctrine."
There is no danger of a Socialistic triumph in any
American Sfate, but the cult may become as danger
ous at some time as did the cult of Populism during
the hard times that followed the panic of 1893. The
growth of the new party is therefore a matter of
serious portent, for American conservatism may
some day have to reckon with it when it will have
the support 'of all the discontented radicals of the
big cities and be a formidable foe.
As a result of the new influence in the conference
the subjects of discussion were in many instances
of a kind utterly unknown at former peace conven
tions. Among them were "The Single Tax," "Indus
trial Peace" and kindred topics that suggest domes
tic politics rather than international peace. It was
noted also that just outside the entrance of the park
where the sessions of the congress have been held
for years there was painted on a mammoth boulder
set in the hillside above the heads of all passers along
the road the bold inscription "Socialism is Coming."
A report of the proceedings as a whole says: "The
session was marked by the advent of a large number
of speakers of the Socialist cule and the trend of
thought was at times distinctly Socialistic."
Popular interest in the development of Socialism
among the universal peace advocates is due to the
fact that of late years the growth of Socialism in
many of the Eastern States has been sufficiently not
able to give the voters of that creed a marked influ
ence in politics. In some States the Socialists hold
the balance of power in many municipalities and
have been able to elect a good many candidates for
important offices. By reason of these demonstra
tions of strength nearly everything that tends to
throw light on the growth or the purposes of the
Socialist organization is studied with no little care
by practical politicians as well as by sociologists.
Hence the interest displayed in the reports of the
appearance of Socialistic orators among the leaders
of the peace convention.
AS a rule the annual convention of the universal
peace congress does not attract much atten
tion outside of the narrow circle of those who
fondly believe that by holding conferences and adopt
ing resolutions they can stay the mad spirit of war
and bring about the disbandment of armies and the
abolition of navies. This year, however, the meet
ing of the convention at Mystic, Connecticut, has been
found interesting for a peculiar reason. It seems the
convention was virtually captured by Socialists and
converted into a Socialistic conference.

to pay $5000 to the discoverer of the pass
through the Cascades through which the
road will pass In building: Its Spokane

The general public are the victims of these condi
tions. Unfortunately the law is throttled by misuse
in the hands of the officers elected to administer it.
In Oakland a non-union lineman was murderously
beset by a dozen cowardly strikers and in defense of
his life drew a pistol. His assailants, who had broken
the law in threatening and attacking him, caused his
arrest for defending himself and a police magistrate
fined him with the alternative of imprison
ment. Now,, in morals this is just the same as if
a gang of highwaymen beset a man to murder him,
as an incident of robbery, and when driven off by a
pistol ask the court to punish their intended victim
for defending himself.
The punishment inflicted by the magistrate is
a direct incitement to further violation of the law.
One young man lies in an Oakland hospital nearly
beaten to death in broad daylight by a gang of strik
ers because he stood upon his right to work for
whom he pleased. The owners of buildings upon
which there may be a plexus of, telephone wires are
told by strikers that they are sent by the company to
see to repairs. Gaining admission to the roof by this
deception they cut the wires and disuse all the tele
phones in that part of the system. Their presence
on the building is a trespass and cutting the wires
is a felony and the general public suffers the con
sequences. These things mean anarchy and it is the
odium of official authority that by such decisions
as that of the Oakland police magistrate the protec
tion of the law is removed from those who obey
the law and its violators are encouraged in their
defiance. Not only in loss and inconvenience does
the general public suffer, for its interests are endang
ered by having passionate and criminally disposed
men taught that the law cannot restrain them.
.One need not seek far afield for the motive of the
police magistrate. He is catering for votes. He has
no fear of the great unorganized middleman, who for
lack of organization does not know what hurts him,
but only knows that he is hurt. Let Oakland have
such an organization as the Fort Brajjg League with
votes far outnumbering those of the law breakers
and their sympathizers and its members bound by an
obligation to enforce the law against all violators,
and the same vote-sniping magistrate will find that it
is to his interest to be mindful of his oath and so en
force the law as not to encourage its violation:
One significant and hopeful sign is that in Fort
Bragg many members of labor unions have joined
this citizens' league. They are men with families,
with hostages given for law and order, who' have no
sympathy with felony and misdemeanor and hold their
American citizenship above all other things.
Its attention is turned first to the suppression of
lawlessness in labor strikes. The whole country is
getting aroused by the conditions of anarchy which
are a feature in every labor strike. Reckless men
play upon the passions of strikers and they lose the
sense of discrimination between right and wrong.
After that chaos and crime follow. The incidents of
the long pending linemen's strike are such as could
be effectively dealt with by such a league. The law
has so far proved powerless to protect the persons of
workmen who, in pursuance of their legal rights,
have taken the place of the strikers, and the law is
equally inefficient in protecting the property of the
telephone company.
When President Roosevelt took up the settlement
of the coal strike he declared that his motive was the*
need of asserting the rights of non-combatants, the
people who were not coal miners nor coal operators,
but the consumers of coal as one of the necessaries of
life. Standing in the matter as the representative
of that class, which far outnumbered the embattled
parties to the direct controversy, he was able to se
cure an impartial arbitration, which seems to be the
beginning of the settlement of many important is
sues involving individual rights and independence.
The Fort Bragg League carries out the President's
idea and proposes by organization to combine the
power of the general public and to use it in vindica
tion of the law and project it even into politics if
need be, in the assertion of the common rights of
THE man in the middle has concluded to defend
himself in the conflict between labor and capital
in which he is getting all the kicks and cuffs
from both sides. At Fort Bragg the constantly re
curring controversies, in the lumber camps have dis
turbed trade and disorganized business to such an ex
tent that the general public has concluded to defend
itself, assert its interests and combine to take care
of them.

to raise the wind for his yacht at a time when she
needed it. Lipton, however, can with some show of
justice ask his countrymen to pay the jam tax with
contented hearts since he has left the price of tea
as it was and placed no tax on the cup that cheers
at a moment when It is the only thing British that
has a cheer left in it.
THE FORT BRAGG LEAGUE.'
THE SAN FE ANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1903.
The modern fallacy that the age of miracles has

ernor Gocbel. After two trials in which he escaped

enough alone ought to be instructive.
to afford a breakfast.
The suggestion that Lipton raised the price of jam
for the purpose of recouping his losses on his yacht
ing ventures is natural, but is hardly well founded.
Lipton is a true sport. He took to yachting for
joy and for glory, for the delight of meeting Ameri
can sports on the deep, blue sea and sailing a swift
race o'er the ocean wild when the salt wind whistles
free and the jolly, jolly mariners lead a strenuous life
of song and plum duff. He did not take to yachting
to raise the price of jam. Doubtless he looks with
sincere sorrow upon the coincidence that has brought
the rise in jam just at the^ moment when his yacht
was defeated and the jam eating Britons should sym
pathize with him rather than to swear at him from
jamless jaws.
How many jars of jam the Lipton factories turn out
has not been stated, but the jars must be numerous
and a penny a jar means a big sum. The contrast
between the amount and the yacht is the more strik
ing because just at this time the yacht seems like
thirty cents. Surely it was for no such yacht as the
defeated Shamrock III that Sir Thomas Lipton has
slipped on the lipped jam jars of England a tax
of a penny a jar.
Had the Shamrock won the raise in the price of
jam would have been accepted by Britain as but a
just tribute to the victorious challenger, the winner
cf the glorious cup, but as it is, the increase in the
price comes like'a blow upon a cheek already sore.
It looks as if the defeated sport were trying to make
his fellow countrymen pay for his whistle instead of
LIPTON has failed to lift the cup, but he has
raised the price of jam, and now throughout the
British Isles there is lamentation and woe. A
breakfast without jam is almost as unknown in Old
England as a breakfast without beans in New Eng

price of a jar jars well nigh every family that is able

These conditions have appealed to his astute
ness in politics. He wrote his Republican letter
when his own party was in a faction fight. His
speech to his convention was made over the dead
body of faction and its inspiration was quite different
from that of his letter. In that speech he said:
"There have been several efforts to divide this party.
There have been well meaning individuals who
thought the Labor Union party was not to be per
petuated and that probably it would be better to fuse
with one of the old parties," and there he stopped,
leaving it to be understood that fusion, indorsement
or any make or meddle with the old parties had been
pushed out of focus. This indicates that he feels
no need of Republican tonic and that he is con
scious of ample strength to go ahead without it.
Republicans are not much given to fusion any
way, nor to indorsement of candidates nominated
by others, and we are sure that they would rather
prefer, if the necessity seem great enough, to origin
ate a common movement to oppose a united front
of San Francisco citizenship to Mayor Schmitz, than
kneel to him on his own terms. -

Here is the majesty of power, the very sublimity of personal grandeur, jj
the physical dominance, the keen, eternal watchfulness, the calm superiority of [ j
the jungle. In the original this picture is such a masterpiece of color that it Â«.'}
is a shame, a positive impertinence, to attempt to reproduce it by any other |j
process but the original. As an art creation it is world famous, not merely \\
because the animals are drawn with such wonderful fidelity to life, but be- f I
cause of that other and far more difficult art â the art of reproducing the f ]
tawny hue of the "King of Beasts" in all its rich splendor. H
Go to any zoo where a lion is to be seen and study him for yourself. Try } j
then to imagine yourself making a picture of him without losing any of that i j
latent force that creeps in every muscle beneath that smooth, glossy hide, and \*
you will understand what not only the artist who painted this picture has 1 1
done, but what the lithographer who reproduced this especially for the Sunday ||
Call's picture" supplements has done ever so much better, and that is to show i|
â¢ \- "Leo and Leonora" in all those rare, yellow, pale brown and tan tints which | j
nature has so cunningly blended into the most perfect skin worn by any beast 1 1
of the forest. \ j
But it is not alone in the coloring that this picture is so attractive. It is \ j
indeed more for the sentiment that pervades it that the painting has become I
so famous. There is a message for loveTS. While his mate sleeps, he keeps M
guard that, her slumbers 'may be undisturbed.' And "Leonora," secure in the N
strength, the' eternal mastery of "Leo's" protection, slumbers in the peace of â¢ U
perfect security. Just look at those eyes. Therein is the light of menace U
against which who would dare intrude? I)

Before the danger was past, 400 acres
of the Yore and Mackey ranches had been
burned over. The danger to Campton
ville lay in the fact that the forest ends
at the very outskirts of the town. The
fire is now under control and unless a
high wind should spring up the people
have no further reason for fear.
The people of Camptonvllle turned out
in force and were Joined by settlers
throughout the section. Scores of men
worked for many hours building back
fires. At times the flames ran up high
in the pine trees and shot into the a!r
200 feet. It had been many years since
that section had been burned over and
there was a superabundance uf highly
inflammable material for the fire to feed
upon.

There are also a baby dromedary, a
baby kangaroo, lion and leopard cubs and
other young animals of jungle life in this
part of the circus.
Among the rare types of adult age are
two giraffes, a rhinoceros, a horned horse
and an eland. There are 108 dens in the
menagerie, which tent is almost as big
as the hippodrome canvas.. It will sent
12,000 people. The show carries 650 horses,
performing and draught, and there are
more than 1080 persons on the payrolls.
All of these will take part in one way or
another in the big parade next Monday
morning. The show will exhibit at Elev

ning next Monday, two performances will
be given daily at 2 and 8 o'clock. Tick

was. On his person were found papers
bearing the name of Charles H. Blake
and a carefully wrapped sÂ»lip of paper
bearing the address of Mrs. Luella Helene

from Cincinnati states that ho may have
been Benjamin J. West, formerly Super
intendent of Schools at Newport, Ky., but
there is nothing to show that he was
West. His appearance is such as to in
dicate that he was not a laborer, al
though he wore rough clothing. His
hands, were soft, showing that he had not
been accustomed to hard work. The body
will be kept as long as possible in the
hope that it may be identified.

REMAINS OF A PRIEST
WILL GO TO MAYNOOTH
It Is contended that nowhere could the
vast and important repairs be better done
than at Mare Island or In San Francisco,
and those who watch naval matters won
der why the cruiser was not sent directly
to these waters for overhauling.
As it was stated some little while ago,
so It Is now repeated that labor demands
have influenced the change in a strong
disposition which was at one period
ehown to have Government work done
in these parts. It has been conceded that
nowhere could more efficient or expedi
tious work be accomplished, yet the ru
mor is to the effect that the department
may even order the New York, after she
has undergone some very necessary min
or repairs at Bremerton, to the Atlantic
coast to undergo the repairs upon which
a small fortune must bo expended. In
the meantime the rivalry continues be
tween the respective navy yards of this
coast for the big and important work.
The cruiser Chicago has been exten
sively overhauled on the Eastern coast
and will shortly take her departure for
San Francisco to replace the New York
as flasrship on the Pacific station.
The extensive repairs to be effected on
the Cagshlp New York, now at Bremer
ton Yard, Puget Sound, are the theme
of much discussion at Mare Island and
among those connected with the ship
building interests of San Francisco. The
rivalry between Bremerton and Mare Isl
and for the contract to do the work has
become acute since the repairs to the fa
mous cruiser will cost over half a million
dollars.
BAN- JOSE. Sept. S. â James E, Jones,
night watchman at the Western Granite
and Marble Company, caused a sensation
In police circles to-day by 'declartnf that
"Red Shirt" Gordon, one of the Folsom
escapes, spent last night in San Jose.
The officers are inclined to doubt the
etory, but Jones maintains that he Is tell
ing the truth.
About 9 o'clock last night, according to
Jones, he met a stranger and became
chummy. They had a number of drinks
together and then spent the night carous
ing. fc
"Gordon," pays Jones, "Instated on pay
ing all the bills. He had taken a liking to
rse for some reason or other and we were
together until 3 o'clock this morning,
when I saw him take tha north-bound
freight train at the San Pedro street
depot. Just before we parted he showed
me two revolvers, one in each hip pocket,
nnd asked me to fork over what money
I had. I offered to divide, but he In
sisted' on having nil the 'money I pos
sessed. I then* handed him ?5, upon which
he informed mo that I had been enjoying
the company of 'Red Shirt* Gordon. 'Tell
Sheriff Langford,' said he, 'that I havo
gone to SallnaB.' "
At the time Jones thought the fellow
was fooling him about being the convict.
To-day, when shown Gordon's picture, he
declared that Iho man he was with last
night was none other than the escaped
convict. The officers, however, believe
Jones has been mnde the victim of a Joke.
They have been unable to find any traco
of the outlaw being in the citv.

Miner Murray was compelled to return
to El Dorado County, but before doing
so he deposited money In a Woodland
bank and authorized it to be drawn upon
for the purpose of providing his brother
with transportation and anything he may
need.* He said it is his desire to have his
brother live with him so that he may be
able to care for him the remainder of his
days.
Mat Murray is about 74 years of age.
He was located yesterday morning- on the
McCullough sheep ranch and informed of
the search for him. He will probably go
to Pleasant Valley Immediately.

DYSPEPSIA OF WOHEN.
Mrs. E. B. Bradshaw, of
thithrie, Okla., cured of a severe
:pase by Lydia E. PinkhanTs
Vegetable Compound.
A great many women suffer with a
' form of indigestion or dyspepsia which
â¢does not seem to yield to ordinary
medical treat mrnl. While the Byrnp-
ioms seem to be similar to those of
ordinary indigestion, yet the medi-
cines universally prescribed do not
- seem to restore the patient's normal
.condition. 'r -''Â¦'-' .-Â«_
Mrs. Pinkham claims that there
is*a kind of dyspepsia that is caused
bv derangement of the female organ-
is'm, and which, while it causes dis-
turbance similar to ordinary mdsffes-
. tion, cannot be relieved without Â»
medicine which not only acts as *
Etomach tonic, but has peculiar uterin*-
â¢ tonic effects as well.
Â¦ Thousands of testimonial let-
ters prove beyond question thaz
- nothing: will relieve this distress-
Ing condition so surely as LydA
E. Pinkhain's Vegetable Com-
pound. It always works in nar-
xnony with the female system.

Nearly all of the starters in the closing
event were held a^short odds, Teufel and

front and was not headed. Wandering
Boy ran second, in front of Isabellita.
F. E. MULHOLLAND.
Lee Jackson rode his first winner at the
meeting in the third running event. He
had the mount on Metlakatla, second
choice In the ring, and In a driving finish
downed Jack Richelieu Jr. something
more than a length. Blphln King, the 11
to 10 favorite, with Henderson up, fin
ished a fair third, apparently not possess
ing the epeed he showed on Tuesday.- Â¦
Frawley, who rode Dusty Rhodes in the
opening number, scored another, win with
Dollie Weithoff , favorite for the first
seven-furlong run. He hustled tho mare
away in front, and, successfully stalling
off the challenges of Chiieno and Troy,
beat the first-named gelding out by four
lengths at the end. David S took the
show from the tiring Troy. :
Frawley, on Dusty Rhodes, took the two
year-old scramble with Dr. Birdsall, one
of the first choices, a good second. The
Magnet colt took the lead. soon. after the
start and was not headed. Doris, another
of the 2 to 1 first choices, finished a fair
third.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 3.â With the
three big rings, tho trained lions,
elephants and seals and the steam
calliope of the circus but a recol
lection, more State Fair talk could
be heard about town to-day and there
was a marked increase in the attendance
at Agricultural Park. There were signs
of life and animation about the betting
ring and gradually the money is finding
its way to the surface.
Four out of six favorites were success
ful, and Jockey . Frawley distinguished
himself by piloting three winners. Possi
bly the Grove fÂ£ Johnson selling Btake at
a mile, with a gross valuation of .$605,
could be called the feature of the pro
gramme. There were seven starters, and
Hagerdon. with Burk up and made a fa
vorite at 2'i to 1 over Kitty Kelly, Divina,
Horatius and Anvil, quoted at threes, won
from start to finish, running the mile in
1:40*4; It was the winner's first appear
ance since an attack of catarrhal fever
at Oakland last fall put him on the hos
pital list. The route seemed too short for
Horatius. which ran a splendid race at
that, giving away weight and three years
to the winner. He was closing strong by
running a close second In front .of Kitty
Kelly. Divina refused to break at the
start, a new wrinkle for that mare.
The 2:11 trot was first called and the
harness horse folk appeared at sea as to
which should be favorite, Ole or Rozell.
Pooling began with Ole bringing 10, Ro
zell 6, Tom Smith 4 and Forrest W 3. In
some later pools Rozell had the call. Ole,
driven by v Quinn, won in three straight
heats. In the third heat Forrest W
earned second money by â¢ being placed
ahead of Rozell. the latter having made
a long winning break. Tom. Smith drew
the pole position before the first heat, but
was given no consideration at the start,
and, leaving his feet at the first turn, # was
shut out. J. W. Zlbble, the horse's driver,
registered a protest with the officials, an
action that was plainly coming to him.

ST. LOUIS, Sept. 3.â Abe Attell of San
P'rancisco to-night received the decision
over Johnny Reagan of Brooklyn in a
twenty-round contest for the world's
feather-weight championship, weight 122
pounds at the ringside.
The contest was one of the cleverest
and " fastest ever seen here. Reagan
showed remarkable cleverness in blocking
and Infighting, and so perfect was his
guard that it seemed almost impossible
for Attell' to get through. His Inside
work troubled Attell considerably. Abe
seemed unable to land an effective blow,
while, on the other hand, Reagan repeat
edly sent left and right to the head and
stomach, causing Attell to wince and
frequently appeal to the referee. Attell
seemed clearly beaten for the first fifteen
rounds. In the sixteenth round Abe sent
in a left and right which shook Johnny
up considerably, and the tide changed to
the Callfornian's favor. From then on
Abe had but slightly the better of It.
In the nineteenth round Abe rushed
Reagan to the ropes and sent in several
stiff punches. Reagan came back strong,
but his punches on the stomach and
cheek landed lightly. He, however, failed
to even matters. The twentieth was give
and take, with honors about even.
The decision was received with Â¦ some
signs of disapproval. James J. Corbett
was present at the ringside.

gan a battle royal down the stretch.
Billy Buck drew steadily out of the
bunch, headed the leader when within 200
yards of the finish and captured the first
heat by a narrow margin In 2:0S?i, the
best time made during the race. Billy
Buck took the lead In the second heat
and found It easy to maintain that posi
tion, winning by a length handily.
For more than half a mile In the final
heat the field held together so closely
that the horses could hardly be distin
guished. Billy Buck won in v a hard drive

DECISION GOES
TO ABE ATTELL
WINS IN THREE
STRAIGHT HEATS
The first time Oakland made an impres
sion was in the fourth. They began to
treat McFarlan to a mild beating in the
shape cf three tallies, although it should
have been more. The big thing came oft
in the seventh. Every man on the team
peerned to souse that ball somewhere.
Then they stopped running and were
caught at the plate and did everything
thry should not have done. So with six
noble and timely base hits, only two runs
wpre registered, the team retiring with
every bag decorated by a Cripple. This
made the crowd angry and no one seemed
to care what happened. Portland made
a^gw more later on and won :n a canter.
TQ Cripples blew up after their, big
eprfnt and never figured again in tha go
ing. The score:

they lasted and the game waa good to
look upon. 8core, Portland 11, Oakland 7.
As usual the Vigneux outfit commenced
to do the hammering act without wasting
much valuable time. During- the Initial
etage cf the struggle they took quite a
fancy to the contributions of Mr. Graham
and succeeded in making a lively get
away in the shape of three big tallies and
a bunch of four base hits, all in a row.
These came when base runners were safe
ly anchored, waiting to amble home.
The Portlanders did not linger long
after the opening spasm. Their vision
and batting abilities were also good In
round two, when a bunch of five all
came In a row. These gave them a
swell load anrt every man on the lot
could see the finish.

Tho contest for the Reapers stakes was
most Interesting. There was Jostling be
tween Sheriff Bell, Proper and Eugenia
Burch as the three passed the clubhouse
and there undoubtedly was a "cross" by
Eugenia Burch when Fuller shot the filly
over from the outside in the race for the
lead as they made the stretch turn.
The fact was that the pacemaker, Faul
conbridge, stopped so fast when still in
fiont that both udom on Proper and Ful
ler on Eugenia Burch were forced to take
chances to avoid losing ground at this
critical juncture.
NEW YORK, Sept 3.-John W. Gates
offered to bet $500 to $100 that tho stew

GUTHRIE. O. T.. Sept. 3. â A Rambler
named C. D. Kim was beatme a woman at
Kaw City and when Officer Kenner attempted
to stop the row the jrambler drew a ptstol and
shot Ker.ner through the body, producing a
fatal wound. 1 The murderer escaped.
Christian Is married and Is about 33
years old. He has enjoyed an excellent
reputation at Crockett, which has long
been his horue. He has been released on
$2500 bail. The officers who caused Chris
tian's arrest say that the stealing had
been in progress only a week or so.
It is claimed by the company's officers
that ample evidence has been gathered
to warrant Christian's arrest. The bul
lion was removed from the works while
in a state of process under leflning. It
was therefore easy of identification, as
there were peculiarities about the metal
which marks It beyond mistake. The
company's officers refuse to tell the meth
od they used to run down the .theft.
They claim their system is needed as a
protection against similar breaches of
trust among the 50) employes at fae
smelter.
CROCKETT. Sept. 3.-Thomas Chrls>
tian, an employe of the Selby Smelting
"Works here, has been arrested on a
charge of stealing $1500 worth of silver
bullion from the works. Christian haa.
been in the company's employ for ten
years and was considered a most reliable
man^ He was exposed while selling some
of the bullion by detectives in the com
pany s service and was taken Into cus
tody at his home in Crockett last ntgKt.
Christian, according to officials of the
works, had taken advantage of hia op
portunities as a trusted workman to take
the bullion in small quantities and dis
pose of it under cover of the subterfuga
that he was a miner, but the perfect sys
tem now employed at the smelter caused
the thefts to be speedily brought to light
and the culprit as accused landed In the
hands of the authorities. After the thefts
were detected a careful watch was quietly
maintained.

the selections were made In some cases

story of the murder of Elizabeth Leroy
and the capture of Victor Walkirez, the
murderer. The day was consumed in the
examination of Detective George J. Kyte,
Captain of Police W. J. Petersen and

ises at the house where the woman was
murdered pointed out to the Jury where
the hidden grave was discovered and
where the blood stains were on the floor,
and described the position the body was
in when it was unearthed.

at Gilroy. He detailed the confession
made by Walkirez on his way back to

The petition fcr letters of administra
tion Is liled In the name of William
Burke, a grandson of the original Wil
liam Dove. His mother was Mary Burke,
Â¦who. with her two brothers, it is said,
ehou-ld have shared the interest in their
father's property. Young Burke has just
tome of age.
The claim, as stated by Colonel Eddy
end Martin Kelly to-day, is this: Dove
died owninp: this property and leaving a
widow and three childrenâ William Jr..
Hector and Mary. It is claimed that Dove's
estate was never probated. His widow
rharried again and she and her second
Â¦husband sold the land and gave a deed
to the same. The claim is that Mrs. Dove
â¢was entitled to only a widow's share of
the property and that the Interests of the
three children were deeded away without
d-ue process of law.
The land was originally owned, accord
ing to the petition, by William Dove, who
died in this city in Ifc62. The petition
filed to-day purposes to administer upon
l.is estate.
Â¦Attorney T. V. Eddy, representing one
William Burke, but more particularly
Martin Kelly, the San Francisco poli
tician, sprung a surprise on the heirs of
the Blake & Mofiltt estate to-day by
filing a petition for letters of administra
tion on two lots of land situated at Tenth
etreet and Broadway, valued at nearly
$50,000, and which have been an asset of
the estate for years.
. The property in question is located at
the southeast corner of Tenth street and
-Broadway, in the heart of the business
part of the city. The buildings are but
one etory in height, but the location of
the laiid itself gives it an Intrinsic value
of many thousand dollars.

GREAT FALLS, Mont, Sept. 3.â What
Is believed to have been an attempt to
hold up express No. 151 on the Great
Northern almost within the city limits of
Great Falls was foiled last night by the
engineer, who ran his train by the spot
where it was to have been halted so fast
that the robbers could not get at him.
Just east of the city the engineer saw
figures by the track side in the darkness.
Some one shouted something, but the en
gineer paid no attention. There was a
shot, and the fcall passed within a foot
of his head and smashed a glass In the
cab. Detectives were hurried to the
scene, but no one was found there. This
vicinity swarms with Pinkertons.

Dr. Herran is momentarily expecting
advices from Bogota announcing action
by the Senate committee to which was
intrusted the question of proposing
amendments to the treaty which It was
hoped would prove successful and lead to
ratification. He believes that sufficient
time has now elapsed for a full considera
tion of the subject and that a report al
ready has been, or soon will be, made.
He has not yet made any application for
an extension of time from September 22 â
the limit of ratification provided by the
treaty.
BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 25 (via Buena
Ventura, Sept. 3).â Congress is discussing
a bill authorizing President Marroquin to
negotiate a new Panama canal treaty
with the United States. The opposition
is doing its utmost to prevent Congress
approving the measure. ,
Secretary Hay has sent a long telegram
to Beaupre, directing him to reiterate to
the Government of Colombia the state
ment made previously by him that the
United States will not accept any modifi
cation or amendment of the Panama canal
treaty. Beaupre 'was told to make It clear
that President Roosevelt, by whose au
thority the instructions were sent, was
obliged to be guided by the limitations of
the law authorizing the construction of
the canal and that he regarded the terms
given by the United States as the most
liberal that could be obtained by Colom
bia within the scope of the law. The
spirit of the instructions is that Colombia
can accept the rejected treaty as it
stands or lose the opportunity of having
the United States build a canal In Its ter
ritory.

In addition to the cargo, which weighs
just â¬000 tons, the Korea carried in her
cold storage galleries food supplies which
in themselves would make a fair sized
cargo for a smaller vessel. Among the
supplies taken to feed the half thousand
passengers and the liner's company were
45,000 pounds of fresh meat, 1900 dozen
epgs, */50 cases of assorted fresh fruits,
half a ton of coffee, half a ton of turkeys
and 300 dozen different kinds of poultry,
including everything seasonable in the
way of edible birds, from hens to snipe
and including pigeons, doves and squabs.
During the stay in port the Korea was
equipped with a swimming tank and
gymnasium for the use of the passengers.
A large number of missionaries sailed
on the liner and among the passengers
were many people well known in the so

BARKENTINE FREMONT. WHICH ARRIVED LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT, SIXTEEN DAYS FROM BERING
SEA. WITH A LARGE CARGO OF CODFISH ABOARD. SHE IS THE LAST BUT ONE OF THE FISHING
FLEET TO REACH PORT.
THE departure of the steamship
Korea yesterday for Honolulu
and the Orient marked a star day
in the career of the Pacific Mail
Company's big liner and estab
lished a new record in the history of
trans-Paclflc travel. Loaded down with
freight until she was drawing thirty feet
of water fore and aft, fhe liner left her
wharf "with the largest number of cabin
passengers that ever departed from San
Francisco on one vessel. Her cargo, by
measurement, is estimated at about 7500
tons. The weight of merchandise and
stores had been skillfully disposed and
the Korea was trimmed like a racing
yacht. Of the nearly WO passengers, more
: than 2C0 had first-class tickets and most
: of them were booked through to . the
. Because he expressed his opinion on
the outside of an envelope sent through
tbe malls P. H. Roberson, who keeps a
saloon on Main street, in Stockton, has
been indicted by a Federal Grand Jury
â¢and must appear for trial. Koberson be
came angTy with the firm of Mebius &
Drescier and mailed them a letter on the
â¢ envelope of which was the following:
"Mfibius & Drescher. dealers In scab
goods and con-union made cigars."
Koberson. greatly to his surprise, was
arrested in Stockton last Wednesday for
violating the United States statute which
..forbids the mnillns of scurrilous matter
â¢ on a postal card or an envelope. Deputy
United States Marshal Morse, who had
'tracked the prisoner to his lair behind
tfce bar, took lioberson before United
'-.States Commissioner Joshua B. Webster,
Â¦who released him on furnishing WO
bands.

WBITZS HIS OPINION
Addresses an Envelope to Business
Firm in Sacramento, Calling
. â¢ Them Names.
An order has been received from the
Secretary also for the deportation of
Y.'ashlro Hattori, a Japanese now serv
ir.g a sentence of three months' imprison
ment in the County Jail upon a convic
tion in the United States District Court
tor trigging in obscene pictures. At the
conclusion of his imprisonment he will be
returned to Japan. Hereafter all alien
ire migrants who shall have been in this
vcunu-y not Jongcr than three years a_nd
â¢who shall be imprisoned for crime will
be deported on the expiration of the term
cf iicjrlsonmeat.
A novÂ«J Interpretation of the immigra
tion laws has been made by George B.
C.ortelyou, Secretary of Commerce and
l^abor, one of vital importance to all im
migrants ucd destined to prevent not
only smuggling, but all other crimes by
that class ot people. The law provides
that aa alien immigrant \rho shall become
& <AareÂ« tipon the state within three
years after his arrival in the United
States shall be deported to the country
\rtesce he came. Secretary Cortelyou in
terprets this law to mean ttat impris
ctsiaeat for crime makes the alien a
charge the state and renders him
liable to (leportatioa.
The first victim of tho Secretary's or
der received yesterday morning by Unit
ed States Immigration Commissioner H-
H. Xorth was Sabura Toda, a Japanese,
who had iust completed a thirty days'
Imprisonment for smuggling silks in his
baggage. Sabura, with three of hi3 broth
ers end one s!st<?r, arrived from Japan
at this port on June 8, Sabura being the
oldest, aud a boy 9 years of age the
youngest. Or:e of the boys named Shiro
' was refused a landing, the United States
quarantine officials havir.y reported that
. he was suffering from a contagious dis
ease of the eyes. The remainder of the
family ere in "a Methodist mission house
et 1229 Pine street. Sabura having ar
â¢rar^ed for their support until he shall
return frcm Japan a year hence, that
being the ehortest time allowed by law
for his re-entry -when purged of all dis
ability.
Newcomers Convictad of
Crime Must Be Sent
Back Home.

CHICAGO. Sept. 3.â On the higher prices for
corn the early wheat market showed strength
with an upturn ln prices. The news was rather
benrteb. however, except that Northwest re
ceipts were smaller and the strength deserted
the pit and the advance was lost. December on
the early bulge sold up to 83'4c. The close
was at the bottom, with a toes of %c at S2%
@S2%c. but the tone was firm. September
was down >,i@%c at 81>Â£c.
Corn was influenced by the prediction of
cooler weather Â«nd especially by prospects of
frosts ln the Dakotas and Minnesota to-night.
Th* market was firm and prices ruled higher,
but the advances were not large. There wai
a good demand for September for shorts, show,
ing that fear of congestion â¢ In ' this month's
contracts still existed. December closed V t c
higher at 51%cÂ» after ranging between 51 %c
and 62VÂ»@Â«2Uc September was unchanged at
52 %c.
Oats were strong with buying of good char
acter, led by commission houses and local
traders. December closed at 37%c the range
for. the day being 36?i@37%c, with September
up %c at 86*Â«c.
Fewer hogs than expected and free buying
credited to packers gave strength to provis
ions. Closing price* were $12 67% for Octo
ber pork. $7 77 Vi for October lard, with Jan
uary at $7 12%. October ribs were $7 05 and

Ripe Banana** were more plentiful, but prices
were maintained under a steady demand. A
car of the Central American prcduct was on
sale and sold at a wide range as to size of
bunch. Mexican Limes were steady. A steam
er arrived with 188 cases, which had not been
marketed up to a late hour. Otherwise there
was nothing new to report.
The local demand for fruit stood about the
same as on the preceding? day, but trading in
shipping stock was more active, orders for
shipment on the Pugct Sound and Honolulu
steamers being plentiful. The demand from
the north was confined chiefly to fine table

kay, Muscat and niack varieties sold at 650

at unsteady prices. Bartlett Pears were scarce,
and a carload that arrived from Southern Ore
gon cleaned up quickly at $1 lClgl 25 per box.
Peaches in small boxes were steady at pre
vious prices, while Plums and Prunes were
firmer, although in free supply. The canners
were purchasing freely of Clingstone Peaches
and paid as high as $27 50 for choice lots.
What few canning Plums or Prunes came In
were quickly disposed of at previous prices.
Figs were In fair request, and as receipts were
lisM, prices were firmer. Quinces and Pome
gm.T.us were offering freely and found few
l.cyeis. There was an active demand for mel
ons, both for local and shipping use. and prices
of Nutmeg Melons and Cantaloupes were firmer.
Berries were in ample supply, and prices

WHEAT â The foreign markets showed little
change. Chicago was J^c lower. The Chicago
letter of Bolton. De Ruyter & Co. saM: "Mar
ket' is a shade easier. Cables unchanged.
Weather in United Kingdom a little more fa
vorable. Weather unsettled In the Northwest.
Southwestern markets report a good cash de
mand at about unchanged prices. Primary re
ceipts still light. Demand Ftlll a little disap
pointing. Market here again lapued into dull
ness, with professional traders working in the
main for lower prlcee. Speculators *eem to be
in the air.' The situation in bullish, but the
market has no speculative leader and the trade
goes out at a small profit or a small loss. So
long as receipts keep so small and demand so i
good we see little to make lower prices. The i
situation abroad would seem to necessitate an
export demand for wheat In the near future,
but It Is slow in coming, We still regard thÂ» !
long side of wheat on the breaks as the wisest !
course." \

that excites attention. Good rates for money
fcrt .!ikt-ly for seme months to come. Loans
' have failed to ccme down from recent high ftg
lirps in Â«pite of recent liquidation. This i? a
Â¦.al^arpointment. and indicatts a continued de
. nianij for accommodation In hgh quarters.
' Italrrad borrowings are known to be heavy.
.but thefce do net cause mncmi, b^inie for legit
'â¢irr.iite purposes and backed by good credit.
Indications jxMnted to some of these loans be
"s-rigr shifted to Europe for the purpose of re
â¢ Ucvtoff the local situation. This would defer
' tto'A imports, but cur credit abroad was
Â¦ .-Vrr n.rthened by our ability to liquidate laet
,: Â¦ -mon's loans, and Europe is much more wlll
.â¢-.g to give us loans than to rak<" our securi

The situation remains unchanged. There are

supply the demand.
Meat Market.
Receipts of river Potatoes were heavy, but
prices were maintained under a fair demand
both for local consumption and shipping. The
general tone of the market, however, was easy
and there was Quite a -surplus unsold at the
close. Salinas Burbanks stood as previously
quoted, with supplies sufficient for all re
quirements. Receipts of Sweet Potatoes were
rather light, but 'there were enough on hand
to satisfy the demand and prices were un
changed. Onions were plentiful and easy.
There was not much change In Vegetables,
the market being well supplied with all de
ecriptlons. There was an abundance of poor
Green Corn 'on hand, which lessened the sale
of crood stock, and prices continued to have
a wide range. Tomatoes arrived freely from
across the bay and up river and prices were
Â£3 before. The canners were buying the bay
product at the minimum quotation. String
and Wax Beans were in light but ample sup
ply and sold well at steady rates. Lima Beans
continued to drag at low figures. Receipts of
Okra were light, the previous low prices hav
ing checked the movement, and fresh stock
sold ' at firmer" rates. The other Vegetables
were unchanged.

higher. Lighter receipts of Hogs and better
general speculative buying were thÂ» causes.
Cash demand is moderately improved, and
there is a pretty fair class of speculative buy-
Ing on the theory that It will continue to Im
prove. Rather think we would buy Provisions
for the time being on the soft spots."

Would Probate Actor's Estate.
OAKLAND. Sept. 3.-Public Adminis
trator George Gray to-day applied for
letters of administration on the estate of
the late Carl St. Aubyn, former manager
of the Amelia Blngham company, who
died at St. Margaret's Hospital last week.
The estate is said to consist of a claim
against Amelia Bingham for wages un
der a contract.
Suit for divorce was begun to-day by
Theresa Bright against John F. Bright
on the ground of extreme cruelty.
Fiest also denies all the allegations
made by his wife of cruelty, and charges
her with having: threatened his life with
knife and pistol. Instead of her being
given a divorce, he asks that he be
granted the decree and the custody of the
child. '
Fiest says that he went to Reno for the
child, â¢ but It had been brought back to
California. He searched the towns about
the bay and finally located It In Watson
ville and recovered It. For these reasons
he alleges that his wife should not be
given custody of the child, as he says she
will seil it.
The story of the deserted Flest baby,
alleged to have been' sold by an Alameda
woman for $S3 and only recovered after
months ot search in Reno, Oakland. San
Francisco and finally "Watsonville. has
been incorporated in a cross-complaint
filed to-day by Judge R. B. Tappan aa
attorney for Clay H. Flest In an effort to
resist the petition of Ida Flest for a di
vorce on the ground of cruelty.
. Flest states in his complaint' that his
wife .first deserted their, 22-months-old
babe by leaving It In a basket In front of
the Golden Gate Foundling Asylum. In
San Francisco. Two days later she was
forced to receive It back again. A few
months afterward she gave the child to a
Mrs. Emily Funke. keeper of a hospital
In Alameda. who. It in alleged, sold the
child for |S5 to a Reno woman.

Goons was loading coal into the heavy

right foot caught in the open jaws of an
empty bucket, and the hoisting machinery
started it out of the hold. As the bucket
raised the jaws automatically closed, car

of workmen. The heavy shoe held to

prisoner were safely lowered. Goons was

After a while taxpayers will come to un
derstand this and will ; organize the city and
county of Alameda, taking in all of the county
north and west of frultvale .avenue. Each
of the cities, of course, will retain its name,
but each will be part of a consolidated city
and county. We must all work for this end.
because if we can succeed in establishing a
city and county government and then continue
the present rate of taxation we will have
about $400,000 per annum to expend on school
houses, etc. Or. putting it in a different way,
we are paying now in these three cities about
$400,000 per annum that could be saved by a
consolidated city and county government. If
we should not desire to save that money but
continue the same tax rate after the consoli
dation it would give us about $400,000 per an
num more to expend for. schoolhouses. streets,
parks and other publlo improvements. Re
spectfully. WARREN OLNEY, Mayor.
Replying, Mayor Olney has written:
The people' of Berkeley, Alameda and Oak
land will, after a while, get tired of paying
at least 05 cents on the $100 more taxes than
they would have to pay if united in a city and
county government. The city and county of
San Francisco is what is called a consolidated
city and county, and haa one set of officeâ¢.
with the result that the taxation in that city
Is $1 61 on the $100. The people of the three
cities on this side of the bay are paying $2 51
on the $100 because they want to keep up in
dependent city governments and a county gov
ernment. _Â¦Â¦'.Â¦ -.'
William O'Neill, 2108 Ashby avenue,
Berkeley, has asked Mayor Olney for In
formation aa to the legal methods to be

his letter O'Neill writes:

"With the poorer players out of the ten
nis tournament the matches In men's sin
gles at; San Rafael yesterday proved In
teresting and exciting. Play was finished
down to the semi-final round. ;- %
Of the twenty-six who entered the tour
nament but four are left to j contend for
the right to meet Champion Freeman
next Wednesday. The four successful
players were Alfonso Bell, chamdon of
Southern California; Grant Smith, cham
pion of California; R. N. Whitney, ex
champion of the coast in doubles, and
Percy Murdock of Alameda.
The best match, of the day was that
between Drummond MacGavln and Al
fonso Bell. In the first two sets Bell
won quite handily. In the third set Mac-
Gavin, by brilliant driving, pulled out
the set from 4-5, wlnnlng|7-5. The fourth
and final set went MaqGavln's way at
the start and at 3-2 and vantage he looked
to have a chance to *ven up the score.
Bell took the next four fames and match.
Bell plays a little better In the back court
than last year, but otherwise plays al
most the sama game. He Is a wonder
at the net and his head work Is excellent.
The other match of the first round was
won by Percy Murdock, who beat Archer
Way, the only other southerner entered.
Way played a splendid game in the first
set, but could not keep It up, and the
next two went to Murdock rather easily.
The match between Grant Smith and
William B. Collier was not as close as
was expected. Smith Is playing a much
stronger game than heretofore and it was
evident after the first game or two that
Collier stood but little chance. The win
ner forced matters throughout the match
and the outcome was never in doubt.
Smith's peculiar service worked to per
fection.
â¢R. N. Whitney beat Harry Rolfe in a
one-sided match.
The semi-finals of the men's singles and
the women's doubles will be played to
day. In the morning R. N. Whitney and
Percy Murdock, the survivors In the lower
half, will meet at 10:30 o'clock. These
men are evenly matched and are both
playing fine tennis. In the afternoon A.
E. Bell and Grant Smith will meet. This
will probably be, the best match of the
tournament. Smith and Bell are great
net players, but comparatively weak in
the back court. It will be a fight for
the net from the start. Bell Is the only
man from the south left in the tourna
ment.
* Six teams entered the women's doubles
and drew as follows:
Preliminary round â Miss Miriam Edward*
and Miss Hazel Hotchklss vs. Miss Gabriel
Dobbins and Mies Florence Sutton : Mrs. Sey
mour and Mips Seymour vs. Miss Bessie Val
leeu and Miss Emma Hunter.
First round â Byes. Missea Violet and May
Sutton; lower half. Misses Ratcliffe.
The matches played yesterday resulted
as follows:
First round â A. E. Bell beat J. D. Mac-
Gavln. 6-2. 6-4. 5-7. 6-3.

A. K. Welby, one #of the best-known
railroad engineers in the country, who
went to Peru a year ago to superintend
the construction of a road for J. B. Hag
gin and his mining associates, returned
yesterday and is staying at the Occi
dental Hotel. The road, which is now
practically completed, extends frcm Lima
eastward to the copper properties owned
by the Haggin interests, a distance of
seventy-five miles. It was started at an
elevation of -12, 000 feet above the sea and
has its terminous. at an. elevation of
17,000 feet. The construction work was
accomplished with considerable difficulty,
but the builder had ample funds and he
used a large force of native labor. The
mines that . the road . taps, Welby . says,
yield ore â¢ that runs as high as 40 per
cent in copper. It took twelve months
to complete the line and his work being
done Welby has returned to California to
join his family, which is sojourning in
the southern part of the State. Some
years ago he was the general superlntend
entof the Rio Grande Western Railroad
and. he gained considerable notoriety by
transforming 350 miles of that line from
a narrow to a standard gauge in one day.

oner: Please be so kind as not to remove my

rooming at Mrs. Verdier's for . about a
month. Nothing is known of her antece
dents or family. About. Jthree weeks ago
she called on Undertaker Maass and in
quired as to the cost of cremating a body.
She explained that a lady friend of hers
was dying, that her husband was poor and
could not afford an expensive burial. All
that she wanted was a plain box. The
undertaker informed -her that the body
could be cremated at a total cost of $30.

quested the undertaker to write the terms
as he had stated and he made a memo
randum on. the back of one of hi3 cards,
which she took with her.

note left for Mr. Maass:
Â» Â¦ Mr. Maasa : I set aside fifty dollars for the
cremation of my body, including coffin and at

Mrs. Verdler was unable to throw any
light on â¢ the woman's antecedents and

paper, who resides at 1719 McAllister
street, in an endeavor to rescue the
drowning: man, narrowly escaped sharing
the same fate and was saved with diffi
culty by the life-saving crew.
The two young men went to the beach
together for a holiday and In view of the
pleasant weather determined to take a dip
in the surf. They were both strong swira
merB and went out several hundred yards
from the shore. Finally they determined
to come in, Boyle leading.
When he reached the beach Boyle wa!s
surprised to find that his companion was
not in sight. He climbed a sand dune
for a better Â¦view, but nowhere could he
see his friend. Some children playing in
the sar.d told him that he was the only
swimmer they had noticed, from which it
is inferred that Law was caught in the
undertow and sank soon after starting
back. 'Z
Boyle was nearly frantic with apprehen
sion and plunged -again into the sea in
teeagch of his missing friend. With all
1:1s strength tie swam back to the place
whtre he had last seen the missing man
ai;d pluckily searched for some trace of
him until he was completely exhausted.
The life-saving crew had been notified in
the meantime, and launching the lifeboat,
thf y rowed rapidly to the scene, arriving
in time to rescue Boyle, who. without
assistance, would have shared the fate
of bis friend. Billy Otis, the pugilist,
formed one of th^ life-saving crew in the
stance of -one of the regular members.
Boyle Wits token to the life saving sta
tion, where h* quickly regained his
strength.

In the inquest yesterday on the body
of G. Nagtta, a Japanese, Injured by be
ing struck by a Santa Fe train and who
died on August 6 in the German Hos
pital, the jury added to their verdict the
following:
"Caused by carelessness of the Santa
Fe Railroad Company and employes of
said company." \
Santa Fe Road Censured.-
About half an hour before the hold-up
in Elmers' saloon on Tuesday night two
men entered the grocery and saloon at
the corner of Wnshington and Leaven
worth streets and had a drink. Two men
wore in the barroom at the time. The
actions of the strangers aroused suspicion,
for when they left the grocery one re
marked, "Well, I guess we will take a
car." They were watched and instead of
taking a car they walked along Leaven
worth street in the direction of Sacra
mento. The grocer and the two men
who were in the barroom called at the
City Prison yesterday afternoon, but
failed to iuentify either Smith or O'Brien
as the strangers who had a drink about
half an hour before the Elmers hold-up.
Elmers, who had a look at the two men
on Wednesday night, told Chief Wittman
that he was almost morally certain that
O'Brien was one of the robbers, but he
would not swear to it. One of the men
who was in the saloon at the time ex
pressed the same opinion.
Detectives Dinan and . Wren, who ar
rested John Smith and Dennis O'Brien,
ex-convicts with long records, on sus
picion of being the two footpads who
operated in the salcons of John Bohner,
300 Turk street; John Sere, Seventh and
Natoma streets, and Henry Elmers, 1345
Sacramento street, worked on the case all
day yesterday to find the rooms occupied
by the two suspects in the hope of ob
taining some incriminating evidence in
the shape of stolen watches. They were
not successful.

He will not disclose the nature of thla In
formation. It is understood that several
private detectives will be put on the case
by the friends of the suspected women.
Detectives Coleman and Taylor are still
trying to find some trace of the purchase
of arsenic at a drug store by some of the
parties supposed to be implicated in the
murder.
The Coroner's Inquest will be held at
10 o'clock this morning' at the Morgue
Mrs. Sutton, Mrs. Bowers, Lervey, Cun
ningham and ill of 'the important wit
nesses in the case will give their testi
mony. The Coroner, with the possible
assistance of District Attorney Byington,
will examine all of those whd may have
anything of importance to tell.
The jury will consist of W. E. Hanson,
236 Montgomery street; Walter Knight,
334 Sacramento street; F. A. Zane, 2324

Professor Green and Chemist Morgan
reported to the Coroner yesterday that
they had found more than four grains of
arsenic in the dead man's stomach. They
are now analyzing the medicines taken
from the Bowers house.
The District Attorney stated yesterday
that he thought he should question John
Cunningham again to ascertain why he
attempted to show that he was the friend
of Bowers instead of admitting that he
v was intimate with Mrs. Sutton.
The Chief of Police and the District At
torney are confident that the ham pur
chased at Goetjen's grocery was poisoned
with arsenic by Mrs. Bowers. They do
not believed that she was sick, too, as she
has stated. Both say that they feel that
they have enough evidence to secure a
conviction although the detectives are
still searching for corroborative circum
stances. Charles True has told the Chief
of Police that he was present when the
bridge builder's watch was given to Cun
ningham and that the circumstances were
as told by Mrs. Bowers.
A. B. Loomis of Â¦ Portland, Ore., a
nephew of the suspected woman, arrived
in San Francisco yesterday and visited
his aunts in the city prison. He says
he will remain here until after the pros
pective trial.
TELL STORY TO-DAY.
Mrs. Harry Bowers stated last night
that she had seen her sister-in-law, give
the sicR man some white powder. She
did not know what it was at the time. She
says that she has heard that arsenic
comes in that form. The chemists found
that the arsenic in the dead man's stom
ach was arsenlous acid. This poison is
a white powder.
None of the attendants in the saloons
In which Mrs. Bowers was in the habit
of drinking in company .with Lervey wilf
say that they ever heard any conversa
tion in regard to the poisoned bridge
builder. Lervey and the woman were
quite affectionate and she generally paid
for. the drinks.
SAW SOME WHITE POWDER.
The statements of Mrs. Bowers and
Lervey in regard to what happened that
night are somewhat conflicting, although
both deny that there was a fight. Ler
vey has told so many falsehoods that it
was no surprise yesterday to learn that
he could play cards and that he could
read his own name on the laundry bun
dles which were left for him at Follis'
saloon. . '
The police have come to the conclusion
that the whole truth has not yet been
told in regard to the meeting between
Patrick Lervey and Martin Bowers when
the latter arrived home unexpectedly
from- Mare Island and found the former
visiting Mrs. Bowers. The woman, Ler
vey and Mrs. McCallum of Portland, Or.,
all agree that there was no serious trou
ble. The neighbors assert that there was.
Saloon-keeper Follis has come forward
with the information that Bowers was
informed" by Harry Walsh that Mrs.
Bowers was keeping company with Ler
vey. Bowers immediately left, his work
on Friday night and came home to find
Lervey at the house. The evidence is
conflicting as to what followed. Some
say Bowers did not show his displeasure
and other say that there was a fight be
tween the two men.
The next day Bowers partook of the
ham from Goetjen's grocery and fell into
an illness from which he never recovered. '
Immediately after his death Lervey went
to the Bowers house and remained there
until the day of his arrest. The police
feel that a knowledge of the events fol
lowing this meeting of the two men will
go far to solve the problem of Bowers'
taking oflf-
Nathan Cahn > the bereaved husband,
who is twenty ' years his wife's senior,
wa3 prostrated by the shock, and the at
tending physicians fear that he may not
recover. Last nisht he was reported to
be in a critical' condition.
H*er brother, Joseph M. "Willard, said
that his sister had absolutely no cause
for taking her life. "She was rich, adored
by her husband, family and friends and
of an exceedingly happy disposition,"
said he.
To My "Beloved Nathan: You ha<T reason, my
well beloved, to find me so much changed these
last few days. Forelve me, my dear Nathan,
the great grief whfch I cause thee and em
brace very tenderly all my own. Adieu. A
thousand kisses from thy SEPHORE.
Mrs. Cahn was born in France forty
eight years ago and had been married
twenty-three years. No cause beyond
mental derangement can account for the
act. She had a beautiful home, a de
voted husband and a large circle of lov
ing friends > and had never indicated in
any way that she was dissatisfied with
life. 'She attended a meeting of the
French Society Wednesday afternoon and
passed the evenins at the residence of
her brother, Joseph M. Willard, at 1S20
Pine street. At both places she seemed
to be in the best of spirits.
After her death a note written by her
in French was found, of which the follow
ing is a translation:
Investigation showed that she had se
cured an old revolver which had been
around the house for years and, seek
ing the closet, had pressed the muzzle
of the weapon to her left breast and
fired. The bullet went through the body,
and struck the wainscoating behind
her. Underneath the body the re
volver was found. Mr. Martin no
tified the Coroner and Deputy Brown
made an investigation. At the request
of the bereaved family permission was
given to keep the body at. the house.
Mr. Cahn ate his breakfast alone, Mrs.
Cahn remaining in her apartments. He was
in a room in the front part of the house
when the attention of himself ami Marie
Hinard, one of the servants, was attracted
by the noise of a shot. The servant
rushed to a. Jsroom closet whence the
sound had issued and found the body of
her mistress lying face downward on the
floor, her garments stained with blood.
She called Dr. W. A. Martin, who resides
next door. When he arrived the unfort
unate woman was gasping in the throes
of death.
Evidently suffering from a sudden fit
of mental Mrs. Sephore Cahn.
wife of Nathan Cahn, a. wealthy retired
dry Koods merchant living at 880 Fell
street, shot herself through the heart at
8:40 o'clock yesterday morning and died
almost instantly. |
