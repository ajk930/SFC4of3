try. At a joint meeting of the directors
of the two Concerns held to-day definite
plans for uniting the two banks were
completed, and all that is now required
Is the ratification of these plans by the
'stockholders, and there is no doubt as to
their "approval of the plan.

name to "The. First and Farmers" and
Merchants" National , Bank of Los An

SOVEREIGN AND DIPLOMAT CONCERNED IN THE SETTLEMENT

The negotiations which have terminated
so successfully to-dayâ so far as broad
lines are concerned, for only details re
main to be adjustedâ were practically
brought to their present phase by Secre
tary Hay and Count Cassinl at a meeting
at the Russian embassy on June 2S. tha
day before the Secretary, departed for
Newport. The Embassador ' then had in
hand the necessary authorization from his
own Government to make the pledges
which are now In process of redemption.
The pledges were reduced to writing by

It now develops that the meeting of
Russian officials at Port Arthur. Just con
cluded, was but one of the steps, though,
an important one. which the St. Peters
burg Government had planned in the exe
cution of its purpose to place matters ot
international administration in Manchurta
In such condition that the ports desired
by the United States and Japan could bo
opened to trade without causing disturb
ance or involving undue sacrifice of prop
er Russian Interests. It already haa been
represented that much of the friction that
had grown out of the Manchurian ques
tion was caused by a sort of triple yet in
dependent administration of affairs In
Manchuria by representatives of the dif
ferent branches of the Russian Govern
ment. The result was that one official
would not feel bound by the pledges made
by another, so that foreign nations com
plained of bad faith. It Is understood
that now. following the Port Arthur con
ference, a compact and responsible direc
tion of affairs' has been arranged for, and
orders Issued from St. Petersburg are cer
tain to meet speedy and exact compli
ance. Although no set time is mentioned
In the promise to open the ports, it Is be
lieved that this will follow soon after tha
Russian evacuation In September.
PLEDGES ARE IN WRITING.
FIRST STEP BY RUSSIA.
The ports to be opened are not yet spec-
Wed, but it is supposed they are Mouk
den, the principal port of Manchuria, and
Tatungkao. at the mouth of the Ya!u
River. The State Department Is highly
gratified at this outcome, feeling that It
has obtained not only for American com
merce, but for the commerce of the world
at large, very substantial gains.
ances have been received
from the Chinese Government that it will
in the near future open as treaty ports

BLOOMINGTON, 111., July 16.â Maud
Jordine walked out of the McLean Coun
ty courtroom a free girl this afternoon.
Justice A. B. Helneman declared her not
guilty of the murder of her baby sister
last Thursday evening. The hearing last
ed less than two hours.
There was a sensational climax when
the result was announced. Hisses and
howls greeted J. P. Butler, the detective
who made the arrest, while there were
cheers and congratulations for the fair
prisoner. There was some fear expressed
that overexcited friends of the girl
might offer personal violence to the of
ficer, but fortunately nothing of the kind
took place.
The evidence presented was calculated
to show that Maud had expressed her
loathing of the task of caring for the
baby and that she did not intend to keep
up this sort of work always.

The American side of the question, as
given by the United States Embassy, says
the Dally Chronicle, is that the islands
are undoubtedly American by right of
conquest, having belonged to the Philip
pine*, and the Sultan of Sulu having con
firmed and acknowledged American su
premacy over the islands, the course
taken was to demonstrate America's right
and establish a more clearly defined line
between the American possessions in the
Philippines and Sulu Sea and the territo
ries of the British Borneo Company.
The islands had never been occupied by
any European nation, and it is unknown
whether Spain ever recognized the trading
treaty that existed between the Borneo
Company and the inhabitants of the Isl
ands.
The Islands concerned, says the paper,
are a group of seven which originally be
longed to the Sultan of Sulu, from whom
thoy passed by a charter in 1881 to the
control of the British North Borneo Com
pany, whose officers confirm that they are
undoubtedly British territory. They are

ENGLAND IS DISTURBED
AND WRITES TO UNCLE SAM
The very great desire always felt by
his Holiness for the leunlon of the dis
â¢ident churches will certainly render this
lemonstratioa of the interest of the
"Dear Sir: The communication for
warded by you has been most gratifying
to the Cardinal secretary of state, my
master. Hi. Eminence hopes that the
holy fathers health will allow him, when
the opportune moment comes, to Inform
his Holiness of the contents of the tele
gram.
A telegram from the Associated Press
having been forwarded to Cardinal Ram
polla. informing him that on Sunday, July
12. prayers were offered In Protestant
churches in the United States for the
recovery of p O p e Leo. the Cardinal has
replied through the following letter from
the secretaryship of state of his Holi
ness:
SYMPATHY OF AMERICA.
No one was admitted to the sick room
yesterday except the Cardinal secretary
of state, who was allowed in only on
the repeated request of Pope Leo. who
said to him that he desired to confirm
and extend the power his Eminence al
ready exercised because of his position,
and authorized him to take measures
which, in ordinary times, would necessi
tate the direct intervention of the Pon
tiff, "in recognition of his personal devo
tion to the Pontiff and the services he
had rendered to the church."
Later the Pope was sufficiently at ease
to receive Cardinal Rampolla, and his
Holiness conferred upon him the enlarged
authority made necessary by the pres
ent Illness for the executive administra
tion of papal affairs. It is understood
that one result of this action probably
will be the speedy appointment of a suc
cessor to Mgr. Volpini as secretary of the
consistorial congregation.
POPE'S TBUST IN RAMPOLLA.
The tenacity of Pope Leo is most ad
mirable, not only in his organism but
even in hie feellne. The best example
thereof perhaps is the continual proofs of
confidence that his Holiness bestows on
Cardinal Rampolla, who after faithfully
serving the Pope sixteen years is now
being made the object of bitter attacks,
especially during the late period, because
of the Francophile attitude of the pa
pacy. The Pontiff seems to have had
an intuition that while he lies with one
foot in the grave Cardinal Rampolla's
adversaries are beginning to take advan
tage cf his tottering power to pull .down
the idol which until yesterday they wor
shiped, so his Holiness leaves nothing
unattempted to show the world up to the
last moment how much he trusts his sec
retary of state. <
Meantime the Pope continued in a state
of great depression. Thanks to his fair
ly good afternoon's sleep, the physicians
were able to issue a bulletin at 7:25 o'clock
in the evening showing that there had
been no vital change in the normal pro
press cf the disease, though the same
serious rapidity of respiration as was no
ticed in the morning had to be again re
corded. So painful had the latter be
come that one of those present in the
sick room described the Pontiff as liter
ally pantine for his life's breath.
HIS BREATHING PAINFUL.
ROME. July 17. 2:55 a. m.â The Pope's
condition this morning is even leÂ«s sat
isfactory than yesterday morning and he
suffered from much uneasiness and diffi
culty in breathing until relieved to some
extent by an injection of caffeine. The
new crisis in the Pope's condition pre
sented itself yesterday, when the doctors
were confronted on the one hand with
the apparently imperative necessity of an
operation and on the othrr with the dan
ger that euch an operation might prove
fatal. This dilemma was canvassed by
Dr. Lappor.i and Dr. Iklazzoni throughout
the day. At their earner conference there
was seme prospect that the operation
nn^i.t uot occur, and the doctors left the
sick room without arriving at a definite
determination as to when it should take
place. They expressed the belief, how
ever, that a delay until to-day would
serve a useful purpose In permitting a
larger extraction of serum in case the
operation were undertaken.
ROME, July 17, 3 a. m.
During the night the
Pope was greatly dis
turbed by the difficulty he
experienced in breathing
and was very restless. At
2 o'clock Dr. LÂ«"ipponi again
had recourse, with bene
ficial results, to an injec
tion of caffeine, which had
not been used in some days
because of the Pope's dis
like for it.
. NEW BRUNSWICK. N. J.. July 16.â
Frederick Nelson of Newmarket, a
brother of Mrs. Charles Fair, who was
killed in an automobile accident abroad,
had a narrow escape from a similar death
to-day. Nelson and a friend named Tits
worth were returning from the seashore
In an automobile. When near this city

a tree, badly bruising and stunning both
men and wrecking the automobile.
The prisoners protested against being
arrested, declaring that they were house
holders and married men and not likely
?to evade the judicial Investigation. Nev
ertheless they were detained in custody.
The prisoners testified that they were
the only witnesses of the automobile ac
cident, but the local paper recalls that
Mae. Hourdet, the wife of the janitor of
the chateau in front of which the Fairs
were killed, declared that sh<j was th*5
only person who paw the catastrophe.
NEW YORK. July 16.â The two French
men who testified on behalf of Mrs. Nel
son in the Fair 'case were named Paul
Germaine Mas and Alfred Jules Moranne.
The officials refused to reveal the names
of the arrested men, but a local paper
announces them as "Louis M and

CHICAGO, July 16.â The passage of the
Illinois Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany tunnel ordinance early this morning
by the City Council after one of the long
est and hottest sessions In the history of
that body opens up a wonderful scheme
"for honeycombing the city wiUi tunnels
for the transportation of merchandise, do
ing away with 75 per cent of the teaming
and with all downtown freight yards and
freight houses. As a consequence the
downtown streets will be relieved of the
congestion that now exists. Â«
This great work Is to cost 115,000,000, and
includes, besides the present system of
tunnels bored by the Illinois Telephone
and Telegraph Company, a twelve-mile
tunnel twelve by fourteen feet running
out to the Stickney tract, in the southwest
part of the city, where is located the Im
mense system of switches designed for a
freight clearing-house for all of the twen
ty-three railroads running into Chicago.
A system of branch tunnels running Into
all of the big mercantile houses, whole
sale and retail, and factories will permit
of freight being transported directly from
the great freight clearing-house to the
mercantile houses, and vice versa, without
appearing on the streets of the city.
The branch tunnels to the buildings will
have immense elevators, that will bring
freight cars directly into the basements
for loading and unloading. All freight
will be carried on ten-foot electric cars
running at a high rate of speed.
Arrangements will be made for "rapid
delivery of goods within the city from
large department and other stores by
means of these tunnels. A parcel delivery
system will be established and connection
made for the benefit of outlying markets
and groceries, so that produce can be de
. livered to them from South Water street.
"With such an immense amount of team-
Ing removed from the streets the street
car service can be greatly improved, and
the necessity for a subway, at least for
years, done away with.

PREPARES CAMP
Thousands of people, congregate daily,
at the "newspaper" corners and are won-,
dering what Is intended by the four im
mense structures that are now rapidly
raising their' heads in the air, far above
the wondering gaze of the passing
throngs.
It is proposed to eTect a magnificent
arch surmounted by a beautiful electri
cal canopy In such delicate outlines as
will be truly electrical in all its effects.
And it r is hoped that the visiting thou
sands \o this city next month will carry
away with them an impression of San
Francisco's unlimited hospitality, such as
will nfiver be effaced from their memo
ries. It is also to be hoped that the
Grand Army's visit to this city will mark
an epoch in the history of this country
Of late years the principal feature of
these decorat!ons has''be'en an electrical
display. Witness the remarkable displays
â on the return of our volunteers, some
thing uninue in the history of municipal
decorations; then the Epworth League,
the Mystic Shriners. the KniRhts of Pyth
ias, and our recent illumination for: the
reception of President Rooseveltâ said- by
many to have been the most pleasing of
any illumination ever held in any Ameri
can municipality heretofore: and again,
said to surpass by far the illuminations
of. the Buffalo Exposition, and of any
European cities held in late years. But
all these are outdone by the proposed
scheme for welcoming the Grand Army
of the Republic for its Thirty-seventh Na
tional EncamDment, to be held In this
city next August.
San Francisco will certainly outdo her
self. and iii saying this will surpass any
attempt ever made in any other place
in the world by way of municipal orna
mentation and electrical display.

j violated its contract with the city and
; that it was Illegal for the city .to pay

The discussion that followed McCarthy's

j was to pay the salaries of the operators
I and that the telephone company waÂ« to
j furnish all wires and instruments free
It was also demonstrated by Supen # ?or
j Braunhart that it would be impossiblÂ«|for
! the city to create the official position? of
i telephone operators and get suitable fer-,
! sons to fill the same. 'Â¦? \
He argued that the work could be 'Tine
by young girls only and that, as t ?y
were not of legal age, it would be oil of
the question to appoint them to oflplal j
positions. He also claimed that it wgild
not be possible to get men to do the vE>rk j

McCarthy claimed that the telephone I
will be carried out, notwithstanding the
action of the Immensely rich and pros
perous railway corporations. The good
tidings come from Los Angeles that the
citizens of that progressive city have
raised $15,000 to entertain veterans who
may tarry there for a few days on their
way to or from San Francisco. More
over, the Los Angeles Grand Army posts
have arranged to come to San Francisco

LIST OF . CONTRIBUTIONS.
While San Francisco contributions do
not come in quite as rapidly as the com
mittee expected, the collections received
and promised indicate that the necessary
funds will be raised in time to pay the ex

San Francisco to-day 'possesses a na

and nhe owes this reputation not alone
to her beautiful climate and remarkable
situation at the door of .the Orient, with
the wide Pacific lapping her western bor
ders and the maffniflcent bay of San
Francisco on â¢ her eastern shore, but to
the world-famed hospitality of Callfor
nlans, and San Franciscans in particular,
in providing a magnificent entertainment
in any event she may undertake. And by
no means the least feature is the manner

.This arch is the conception of William
R. Hewitt, chief of the Department of
Electricity, and the plans and designs
were worked out in detail under his im
mediate supervision by a most competent
corps of office assistants. This arch will
be the most- remarkable feature of nny
of the Grand -Army's encampments held
in many years. /*_ â¢
The arch is a feat of engineering and it
is remarkable that such a structure can
be erected and finished in all its details
In such a short time. But we are par
ticularly fortunate in entrusting this
work to the Department of Electricity of
this city, which has had charge of all
electrical displays for the last few years,
and to this fact is largely due their suc
cess.
FEAT OF ENGINEERING.

highly ornamented circles, rising from
the base and continuing upward until it
fades away in a delicate scroll, studded
throughout with incandescent lights In
striking effect. From this height the
arch supports a beautiful colonnade of
sixteen columns, resting on a circular
base 50 feet in diameter, all handsomely
and richly ornamented in stucco work
with electrical \,- effects interlaced and
worked out In a striking design with 1500
electric lights. The stucco work of the
circular base; of the colonnade will be
a beautiful frieze of scroll design brought
out in bold relief. Surmounting this colon
nade and extending to a height of 135 feet
above the street line will be*a beautiful
tent-like electrical canopy carrying 2000
electric lights worked in lines of alter
nate red, white and blue, and supporting
a forty-foot flagstaff cairying a 2S-foot
American flag. At the base gf this flag

to a distance of 90 feet below will be a
huge electrical ball seven leet in diameter

in New Jersey. In no other States were
any considerable amount of poles and
wires cut down. The Western Union val
ues the property destroyed at ;i ,000 .COO.
The cash value of the property is con
servatively estimated at $S50,000.
Should the United States Supreme Court
sustain the appeal of the Western Union
from the United States Circuit Court, the
Western Union will undoubtedly bring
euit against the Pennsylvania for this
property destroyed and the damages re
sulting therefrom. On the other hand
should the appeal of the Western Union
be dismissed by the United States Su
preme Court, the Pennsylvania will sue
the Western Union for the expense of cut
ting down and removing this property
from land belonging to the Pennsylvania.
For the year ending June 30, 1902, the
Western Union had 196,115 miles of poles
and 1.029.9S4 miles of wires in operation.
The total amount of property destroyed
was iÂ£3 miles of poles and 10.216 miles of
wire. This is less than one-half of 1 per
cent of the total mileage of poles and less
than 1 per cent of the total mileage of
v.-lres. As the Western Union is still op
erating its svstem in the State of Penn
sylvania along the highway and on pri
vate rights of way, it is said that the loss
in revenue to the Western Union is rather
inconsiderable. Of course it does no busi
ness at stations of the Pennsylvania Rail
road. Apart from that, it is still operated
throughout the entire State. The loss of
revenue to the Western Union will be ex
ceedingly small and will, it is asserted,
not in any way affect the dividend rate

Mrs. Hughlett's Effort to Obtain a

BERKELEY, July 16.â Mrs. Mary
Hughlett, who tried to murder her two
children and kill herself ln Los Angeles,
was a roomer with her children for two
weeks with Mrs. A. L. Huston of 2124B
Center street. She came, looking for a
house large enough for boarders and went
the rounds of the real estate offices. Mrs.
Adelaide Marauand showed her several
houses and she picked out one on Ban
croft way, but after paying a deposit it
was discovered that it had been sold to
other parties. She was disappointed over
this and sailed Sunday morning for Los
Angeles, saying that she might return
later in the vear.
j*'She promised to write to me as soon
as she got to Los Angeles, but I haven't
heard from her," said iurs. Huston to
day. "Her children promised to write to
my children, too, but they have received
no letter so far. She was a lively, pleas
ant woman and the last one in the world
you would think would do the terrible
thing she attempted. She had some little
peculiarities, but they were not especially
noticeable. She was very fond of her
children and always had them with her.
I judged from the way she talked she
had considerable money."
Mrs. Hughlett has a brother and sister
in San Francisco. The sister is Dr. Alice

definitely stated at this time. It is as
sumed, however, that the proceedings vyill
be similar to the Delaware, Connecticut

Pleadings and proof showed that the ap
pointment of a receiver caused the principal of
the mortgages, amounting- to $20.<>OO.lXlO, on
the property of the company to become Imme

NEW YORK, July 16.â Legal compli

the United States Shipbuilding Company.
To-day at Trenton, N. J. f legal sponsors
for the shipyard trust, acting for the
directors and dissenting security holders
who had opposed the appointment of a
receiver, filed an appeal with Judge Kirk-
Patrick. The suit now goes to the. United
States Circuit Court of Appeals in Phila

Judge Kirkpatrlck's opinion that under
the New Jersey statutes relating to solv
ent corporations he had Jurisdiction. The
contention also is made that in the ex
ercise of general equity jurisdiction un
der the rules of the Federal court he
was without jurisdiction, sjid a third con

right to make an order of Insolvency.

As chairman of this committee I wish to
rpe*k a word of praise to the women who did
their part toward raising the mortgage upon
this splendid l>uildlng. During the canvavs hun
dreds of letters came to mÂ« â all letters of royal
good will â not all contained gifts of money by

spirit cf love and philanthropy 4n their heart!
and are anxious and willing to form a link la
the chain of workers who are quietly and
earnestly serving humanity by obeying the

the years that have passed, no society or In

burning question of "what to do with our

I. J. Truman in a humorous speech said
that although treasurer of the association
he never saw the cash, but all he did was

to Henry J. McCoy, for his energy in the
cause of the association, and expressed
his delight at being able to participate In
the Jubilee.
PRAISE FOB ASSOCIATION.
The evening was devoted to a reception
to members and young men in general,
in the auditorium. Rolla V. Watt presid
ed and many gentlemen associated wfth
the work were present on the platform.
It was in every sense a sociable evening.
The music provided by Robson's orchestra
kept everyone ln happy humor, Mies Es
ther Macomber delighted the assemblage
with clever readings and stories, admir
ably delivered and the Knickerbocker
Quartet sang and was encored again and
again.
Dr. R. W. Smith, who was seriously In
jured in the recent North Shore Rail
way wreck, with his left arm still , dis
abled, joined the quartet and received a
rousing reception.
President Watt spoke of the Importance
of the jubilee and the advantages of be
ing out of debt. Edward Coleman, chair
man of the Board of trustees and vice
president of the association, reviewed the
many good things accomplished. He be
lieved It was one of the best schools for
preparing young men for their future
careers, because the association, he isaid.
was founded on sound principles. He said
that it takes preparation for all duties in
life and the Young Men's Christian As
sociation assumed the fitting of youth for
the years before them. Mr. Coleman
could see no end to the good to be
achieved.
Mrs. L. Snider Johnson rendered several
vocal selections, accompanied by Dr.
Stewart. A. A. Macurder led and Miss
Mabel McCoy accompanied the sacred
songs, in which all present joined.
A SOCIAL GATHEBING.
She then spoke of home influence, which
was, she Bald, a great factor in deter
mining the future of youth.
Mrs. Isidor Ix>wenberg delivered an ad
dross on "A Woman's Part in Laying a
Broad Foundation for the City's Future."
in which she referred to the training of
the boys of the city to fit them to hold
responsible positions when the time comes
that their services will be ready for pub
lic life. Mrs. Lowenberg said the one
way to lay the foundation of the city's
future rcEted in the work and influence
of the women and on the strength of
boys who will be the future men of the
city. She hoped to see the plan of a
Boys' Christian Association realized.
Mrs. B. C. Wright spoke of the work

tory of the world when the influence of
th*- association was eo great as' to-day,
and in this respect she could but hope
that the day was near when there would
be an addition to the association where
boys would be given the opportunity of
a manual training. She suggested that
lofty and noble ideals should be placed
in the way of the youth of the country:
that he should be shown and taught their
importance on his future life. Boys
should have their Boys' Christian Asso
ciation. Thousands of boye. she said,
longed for encouragement and hoped for
a kindly word. In such an association,
devoted to boys, they would receive that
kindly treatment and encouragement
which they needed as an inspiration. Mrs.
Brown then instanced President Roose

him In the foremost position of his coun
try. She thought every boy in the land
had that same opportunity to come for
ward and take part some day in the gov
ernment of the Uriitrd States. But she
thought" the boy must be worthy and in
the verv depth cf his soul he must be
true.

OLD RESIDENTS WHO WILL,
CELEBRATE THEIR GOLDEN
WEDDING MONDAY.
Father Sullivan will say solemn high
mass next Sunday morning at 11 o'clock
at St. Patrick's Church.
Father Sullivan was educated in the
College^ of the Sacred Heart and later at
St. Mary's College, and the past five years
he has spent at the College of Lille,
France. He is well known in this city,
was popular with his fellow students and
has a host of friends and relatives. He
is a son of Mrs. Marcella Sullivan, 1010
Howard street, and a native of San Fran
cisco.
The' minor orders of the church and
tho.se of sub-deacon and deacon were con
ferred on Father Sullivan in France, but
Archbishop Riordan, as a special mark of
his esteem, decided to have the order of
priesthood conferred on the young can
didate In .his native city In the presence
of his mother and other members of his
family.
The young priest, with his hands be
tween those of the Archbishop, then
promised reverence and obedience to his
ecclesiastical superiors.
The cermony closed with the regulation
instructions to the new priest and the
episcopal benediction, after which the
clergy retired from the sanctuary, leav
ing the new priest to greet and bless his
relatives and a large number of friends,
who remained ln the church for that pur
pose.
Receive ye the Holy Spirit. Whose sins you
shall forgive they are forgiven, and whose elna
you shall retain they are retained.
Just as the cathedral clock struck the
first note of 7 the priestly procession en
tered the sacred edifice. First came the
attendants, then the priests, followed by
the Most Rev. Archbishop George Mont
gomery, the ordaining prelate. He was
escorted by Father Mulligan, who acted
as arch priest, and Father Hannigan,
who acted as master of ceremonies.
The following priests occupied seats in
the sanctuary:
Father John McGinti ; Father Gallagher. S.
J.; Father P. Heslln, Father Patrick Collopy.
Father Morgan. Father M. Connelly, Father
Harvey. Father John Sullivan; Father Butler,
S. J.; Father W. Butler, Father Barry, Father
O'Ryan, Father Charles A. Romm and six
Christian , Brothers from Sacred Heart College.
â¢ Last came the candidate for ordination,
who was presented by the arch priest.
After the introductory services by the
Archbishop, the candidate prostrated
himself at full length on the floor of the
sanctuary, at the foot of the altar. Dur
ing the prostration the "Litany of the
Saint" was said alternately by the Arch
bishop and the attending priests. At its
conclusion the candidate arose and while

Mr. and Mrs. Fraser were married in
Watertown, N. Y., on July 20. 1833,, and
in 1859 Mr. Fraser crossed the plains, via
Salt Lake, and after enduring many hard
ships arrived at Hangtown, now Placer
vllle. El Dorado County, in August of
that year. He reached this city on Sep
tember 13, the same day that Senator
Broderick was killed in a duel with Judge
Terry. The following: year Mrs. Fraser
arrived in this city, via Panama, with
their three sons. Four children, all boys,
were born to the couple, two of them
only being left and both residing in this
city.
Mr. Fraser was elected a Supervisor for
the years 18S0 and 1SS1. He was chair
man of the Fire Committee and saved out
of his appropriations $40,000 to erect the
present fine brick corporation yard build
ing at 52 Sacramento street for the use
of the Fire Department. He has been
prominently identified with the four-Scot
tish socitles in this city, has been elected
chief nf two of them and held office in
the others. For the last thirty-five years
he has worked assiduously for the best

NATIVE SON WHO WAS YES
TERDAY ORDAINED TO THE
CATHOLIC PRIESTHOOD.
Immediately the .children became 111 and
were seized with fits of vomiting and the
mother knew the poison had not taken
effect. Then she took the emetic. All of
them were sick all night, but no physi
cian was summoned. The mother admit
ted that she would have made another
attempt had she not been found this
morning.
There is no doubt that she Is insane
upon that subject, but upon other sub
jects she is as rational as anv person.
She says she contemplated killing her
children and herself months ago, but the
opportunity was not presented. Her only
reason for wishing their death arid her
own, she says, is because she fears she
will not be able to care for them prop
erly. This fear is groundless because she
has a number of well-to-do relatives who
will provide for her wants.
FAILURE OF POISON.
The little girl demurred because of the
taste of the drug, but the mother urged
her to take it. and the son, suspecting
nothing, took it first to show his sister
that he was not afraid. Then the daugh
ter swallowed her portion and the mother
too what remained.
When the letter was finished the chil
dren were asleep, and when she returned
from mailing it she says she looked at
them sleeping and thought it would be
cruel to awaken them, inasm h as that
was the last natural sleep ihey would
make, as she supposed. She therefore de
ferred poisoning them until Wednesday
night: On that night she produced the
poison, of which she had purchased six
ounces on Monday, and asked them to
take each about one-third of the contents
of the bottle.
Mrs. Hughlett did not try to conceal
what she had done, but told .of her move
ments ever since she left Berkeley last
Saturday. With her children, she arrived
here on Monday. Her purpose in coming
here was to be nearer the home of her
relatives, so they would not have the ex
pense of shipping her body and those of
her children from Berkeley, for she had
made up her mind to end all their lives.
Tuesday night she wrote the letter to her
sister, directing what disposition should
be made of her personal effects.
CONFESSION OF MOTHER.
The police searched all last night for
the little family, hoping that instead of
giving the children poison on Tuesday
night, as she had threatened in the let
ter she sent to her relatives ln Santa Ana,
she had deferred committing the crime.
The three were found early this morning
in a lodging-house on East Fifth street
near the Arcade depot. J. C. Thomas,
proprietor of the house, seeing the news
paper accounts of the woman's disappear
ance and what she had written to her
relatives, recognized her and notified the
police. The three were placed in the care
of relatives and were taken to Santa Ana
this evening. The mother will not be
given another opportunity to kill her chil
dren and it is probable that she will be
examined as to her sanity.
Realizing that her effort to end their
lives had failed, and not wishing to die
without them, the mother love asserted
itself and she prepared and took an
emetic of soapsuds and relieved herself
of the poison.
In her Insane desire to cause their
death and her own she administered more
than two ounces of the poison to each of
the children and then took about an equal
quantity herself. The drug sickened the
children and they threw it up, but the
mother retained it.
LOS ANGELES, July 16.â Only the
ignorance of the mother of the effects of
laudanum and the quantity necessary to
produce death prevented Mrs. Mary
Hughlett from murdering her two chil
dren, Frank, aged 14 years, and Grace,
aged 12 years, and then committing sui
cide.

other mines, followed down and as soon
as practicable began a search for the vic

A question of the highest interest is
whether or not the slight mutual Influ
ences of the planets will 'destroy In the
lapse of time the present general configu
ration of the solar system. It is conceiv
able that the large planets may collide,
or that part or all of them may be pre
cipitated on the sun. or that the eccen
tricities of - their orbits may become so
great that radical changes of seasons will
result from their varying distances.
Thus, if the eccentricity of an orbit
should be reduced to one-half, the planet
would Betnree times more distant at
aphelion than at perihelion, and in the
former case it would receive one-ninth
as much heat and light as in the latter.
A rigorous mathematical answer- to the
question of stability is by no means easy.
What can be legitimately Inferred from
the investigations which have. been made
on this subject? Only thisâ unless there
are other forces involved than those con
sidered the general configuration of the
solar system will remain much as it is at
present for a long time., probably tens of
thousands or even millions. of years. The
statements made In many excellent popu
lar books that the stability of the solar
system for. all time has been proved is
entirely too strong nnd has absolutely no
logical foundation. 1 The mathematical
evidence is no better than that furnished
.by. geology and. biology, and such sweep
ing conclusions cannot' be drawn from
the data . furnished by any science.â New

The Special Senses of Animals.
Dr. Werner of Vienna has lately print
ed the results of his observations upon
the special senses of animals, especially
upon the senses of reptiles and amphibi
ans. He concludes that these latter are
capable of going directly toward water,
which attracts them, so, to say, even at
long distances. .Light acts upon them, in
dependently of heat. In winter they quit
warm lairs to go to sunlight. Their sight
is generally good: and is probably their
most acute sense; yet their vision Is very
limited. Crocodiles cannot distinguish a
man at distances â¢ above ten times their
length. Fish see for only short distances.
The vision of serpents is poor. The boa
constrictor, for example, can see no fur
ther than a third of its own length. Some
snakes see no further than one-clghth of
their length. Frogs are better endowed
and see twenty times their length.' The
hearing of all , these animals Is even
worse than their sight. Most reptiles are
deaf, especially : boa-constrictors. ' "Deaf

ditions under which the new ports are to
be opened.
It may be stated that had the United
States Government cared to pursue a sel
fish policy it might easily have obtained
promises of special privileges from Rus
sia, but Secretary Hay has held to the
broader doctrine of the open door in Man
churia for the whole world.
TATTJNGKAO IS FAVORED.
Respecting the two ports mentioned 'as
likely to be opened, namely, Moukden and
Tatungkao, it may be said that, both po
litically and from a trade point of view,
the latter port is apt Jo prove the more
Important, though the place is so little
known now that the name Is not to be
found on many of the best charts. It lies
on the right bank of the .Yalu River, not
far from its mouth, and it is close to the
Korean town of Weju, an important trade
center, which undoubtedly will prove trib
utary to the new port. At present Ta
tungkao does not amount to much, but
rapid development is looked for as soon
as it becomes a treaty port. At first the
United States Government Bought to have
Takushan made an open port In this part
of Manchuria, but the Japanese favored
Tatungkao, and the United States aban
doned the former when It appeared that
the latter port is open all the year
around, while Takushan is closed by ice
during several winter months.
Moukden Is at the head of navigation on
the Liao River and Is the point from
which caravans start through Manchuria
and Siberia. It is now the largest port in
Manchuria next to Newchwang.
Simultaneously with the promise to open
up Manchuria to the world's trade comes
a report to the Btrreau of Commerce and
Labor from United States Consul Miller
at Newchwang. which thus far is the only
open port In Manchuria, respecting the
cotton goods trade of that province. He
says that the great market for cotton
goods in Manchuria Is attracting the
earnest attention of Russian manufactur
ers at Moscow. They are seeking to cap
ture a good share of the $12,180,000 worth
of cotton goods trade that annually comes
through this port, and are offering tempt
ing Inducements to merchants to go to
Moscow to purchase their supplies. The
Consul refers to a dispatch to the Minis
ter In Peking in which the latter men
tioned that a Russian agent had taken a
number of merchants to Moscow to make
a contract for the importation of the
drills imitating American products. The
Consul reports the return of these mer
chants to Newchwang because the drills
were not quite up to the American stand
ard in quality.

The trial just ended was the second in
which Zidmair was defendant. He was
charged with having shot and killed
George Relder In April, 1901. He was con
victed of murder in the flrgt degree on
his first trial and sentenced to be hanffSd.
He was later granted a new trial on er
rors of the lower court. It is understood
that his counsel will move for a new trial
and that an appeal will then be taken if
an order denying the new trial is made.
â¢ The case has attracted a great deal of
attention, principally because of the de
fense set up. Murderer and victim came
to Montana from Bohemia twelve years
ago and were prosperous neighboring
ranchers. Zidmair asserted that Reider
had ruined his daughter, the disgrace of
which caused his wife to commit suicide.
When he reproached Reider for his al
leged Â¦â¢ misconduct he asserts Reider at
tacked him with an ax and that he then
shot him In self-defense.

spot and no report made of the crime for
a year, which evidently had great weight

FRESNO, July 16.â Edward Pascoe, a
wealthy rancher of Corlew'p Meadows,
Pine Ridge, has mysteriously disappeared,
and his nearest friends express the opin
ion that he has been murdered.
Pascoe came to Fresno in the latter
part of April to transact business of im
portance. While here he purchased a
light spring wagon and a horse, and left
hi? new outfit at a livery stable on April
22, stating he would call for It the fol
lowing morning. On the same day he ar
ranged to take a friend with 'him the
next day to his ranch on Pine Ridge, and
his friend was at the stable in due
time, but Pascoe was not there.
On May 13, according, to the cashier of
the People's Savings Bank, he visited the
bank and cashed a check for J400. He was
told at .the time that Inquiries were be
ing made for him, but he said everything
was all right. He left the bank and has
not been seen since, and so far as can
be learned has been seen by no one ex
cept the bank officials since April 22.
J. F.' Meyers, who owns a ranch ad
joining that of Pascoe on Pine Ridge, and
who was a sort of business partner, as
serts that he is positive his friend met
with foul play. He knows Pascoe had a
considerable sum of money when he came
to this city, and says the man would not
neglect his interests on the ranch for so
long if he were alive. Pascoe Is about
44 years old.

The salient Interesting facts about the
cruiser Colorado, launched near Philadel
phia a few weeks ago, are,: She is of the
new series; will have a speed of twenty
five miles an hour, or that of the ocean
liner; will have a greater number of
heavy rapid-fire guns than any other ves
sel, and, being named after a State, the
average reader will take her for a battle
ship, names of cities hitherto having oeen
used for cruisers, while names. of States
were held sacred to battleships.
At the close of yesterday's session Liv

In reference to a boycott being levied
against the United Railroads by the
trades unions of San Francisco > Holland
said that such a step would mean that
tho company would find it very expen
sive for a while, and that there would be
no immediate profit. He considered that
if the men were to receive an Increase
to $3 a day for nine hours' work it would
cost the company about $700,000 a year
more.
"I think the men in their own hearts
think that their demands are extreme,"

replied Holland.
"Well, supposing you had a strike on

expect this matter to be settled satisfac
torily to the men."
"Do you think, then. thi.t trade unions
are making: wages too high?" he was
asked.
Then Livernash tried to extract from
President Holland his views' on trades
unionism.
"Are you friendly to the Carmen's Un
ion. Mr. Holland?" asked the attorney.
"Yes. sir." Holland replied. He fur
ther exnlained that he understood that
the Carmen's Union was maintained for
the purpose of Increasing the wages of

however, with the remark, "You cannot
President Holland was on the stand all
day yesterday and he did little practically
but Indorse what he had said the day
previous. Once in a while his mind would
wander from the subject of cross-ex
amination and then Attorney Moore
would swoop down and drag him out of
the dangerous going. For Instance. Hol
land stated once that the wages of farm
hands in this State were Ho a month.
"Wait a minute. Mr. Holland: you did
rot understand that question, did you?"
asked Moore. "Please read him the ques
tion again. Mr. Reporter. "You don't
mean to say that farmhands earn $45 a
month and thâ¬ir board, do you, Mr. Hol
land?"
. THOBN FOB LIVERNASH.
'â¢Why no. of course not," responded Mr.
Holland. "I meant that the farmhands
get Ho a month and about J15 of that is
deducted for board and room."
The most Irritating thorn in the side of
Lievraash was the statement by Presi
dent Holland that he could get at any
time 2CÂ»Xi men who would be glad to take
the places of the union platform men and
would work for the old schedule that was
in effect before the strike of April. 1902.
"Where could you get these men, Mr.
-Holland 7" asked Livernash.
"Oh. lots of places." answered Holland
cheerfully. "I am sure that if there was
a strike among the carmen in this city
that farmhands and laborers in the coun
try would flock here to take their places.
I don't like to discuss the subject, as I
don't want the impression to go out that
I am oppossed to or wish to fight the
Carmen's Union."
During the day President Holland gave
the real inside information concerning the
company's idea about the adjustment of
the trouble. He said he thought if the
carmen were given a flat rate of 25 cents
an hour they would be getting a great
â¢ deal more than they really expected they
would get and that they would not think
of another raise. He further explained
that by giving the men the increase It
would establish "permanent industrial
peace."
President Holland evidently has high
hnpes that the board of arbitration will
not grant the carmen's demands of J3
a day for nine hours' work. He laughed
et the demands as preposterous. -Â«*-/ -V
THINKS $3 ZXOBBITANT.
"Now. Mr. Holland, supposing that the
arbitration board awarded the carmen a
wage of 33 1-3 cents an hour, or $3 a
day. would you be willing to pay !t?"
he was asked by counsel for the union.

it is the right expresson on this sub

EUROPEAN criticism of American art of al
most any kind is not as a rule very cheerful
reading for us. Even when they commend us
they do .so with a sort of condescension implying a
belief that we are not in the same class with them-,
selves and that praise given to us means no' more'
than so much patrpnizing approval given to a smart
boy. It appears, however, that in one art we have
really captured Europe and are leading crowned
heads and artists alike in triumnh. behind our vic
torious chariot wheels. That art is the art of stage
dancing. /- : .V ->
The average American has not looked upon stage
stepping of any kind, from the skirt dance .to the
cakewalk, as a source of national pride, but it seems
we shall have to do so if we wish to have any pride
at all. Lontj ago "reports came in "that the cakewalk
had captured Berlin, had been approved with de
light by the Kaiser, and had been danced by high dig
nitaries and stately dames at a court reception. Only
recently it is announced that King Edward, who^has
not many points of sympathy or affinity with the
Kaiser, has agreed with him orTthat one at any rate
and has had cakewalk festivities at Sandrihghanv â¢
The approval of crowned heads is flattering from
a social point of view, but it is worth nothing in the
\ ir!d of art, and. consequently we may note with de
light that artists as well as Kings and Emperors have
found joy in the American. dance and are looking to
it as to the coming. of a new era. in the realms of

had refused to give his sanction to the

the ground that the monthly report -would
contain actual statistics as to the health

to the committee with instructions to
again confer with the Mayor.

AHWANEEâ C. City. The books on
Indian names do not give the definition
of the name Ahwanee. The question
asked was submitted to the Bureajj of
American Ethnology of the Smithsonian
Institution and the reply from there is:
"Your query as to the meaning of Ah
wanee has been referred here and there
for several months, but no one has been
able to give the meaning. '. Inclose- note
from A. S. ' Gottschett. one of dur"lÂ»est
men." The note referred to is as follows:
"I have not yet secured the meaning of
Ahwanee, but think the name was an im
portation from the East." Can any of
the readers of this department give the
meaning of this word, which is the name
of a place in the Yosemlte Valley?
Such are the declarations which the educators of
the country have to make to the American people.
Compared with resolutions that emanate from the
general run of American conventions they are sin
gul2rly moderate and conservative. The demand for
an increased dignity and an augmented appropriation
for the National Bureau of Education is in. line with
the general trend of American<thought. We. are
growing to rely more and more upon governmental
supervision and help. Commerce, agriculture, labor
and ir.ining each and all ask for representation in a
Cabinet department or an independent bureau, and it
is but right that the great work of public education
should also have ample recognition and representa
tion in governmental administration.
The portion of the declaration that will find most
response from the thoughtful elements of the peo
ple is that which calls for a more careful instruction
of youth in reverence for law. Of late there have
been many portentous signs of a growing. lawless
ness in nearly all parts of the Union. Atrocious
crimes committed by mobs under the name of lynch
law are the worst and the most conspicuous of these
evidences, but they are by no means all. Offenses of
violence committed under circumstances that show
a contempt for law are becoming so common as to
create a serious fear that the future of the country
may be one of disturbance and disorder unless some
thing be done to check the tendency. Anything that
the schools can do to inculcate a better tone of pub
lic sentiment in that respect will be a valuable ser
vice to the republic, and it is gratifying that the
teachers have placed such service among the prin
ciple? to which thiy dedicate themselves.
Taking then in the order as presented in the
declaration the principles consist of the following de
mands: â¢ "The Bureau of Education at Washington
thculd be made an independent administrative de
partment, such as were the departments of Agricul
ture and Labor before their elevation to Cabinet
rank. Sufficient appropriation should be made by
the Congress to enable the Commissioner of Educa
tion to extend the scope and add to the usefulness of
his work." Provision should be made by Congress
"by which the people of Indian Territory will have
power to establish and carry on a system of public
schools so that all classes of citizens in the Ter
ritory may have ample educational advantages."
"Teaching in public schools will not be a suitably at
tractive and permanent career, nor will it command
as nv-ich of the ability of the country as it should,
until teachers are prcperiy compensated and are as
sured of an undisturbed tenure during efficiency and
good behavior." "State aid is to be regarded- as
supplementary to and not as a substitute for local
taxation for school purposes. In many parts of the
United States a large increase in the amount of the
local tax now voted for school purposes is a press
ing need if there are to be better schools and better
teachers." "The highest ethical standards of con
duct and of speech should be insisted upon among
teachers. It is not becoming that commercialism or
self-seeking should shap'e their actions or that in
temperance should mark their' utterances." "School
buildings and school grounds should be planned and
decorated so as to serve as effective agencies for
educating not only children but the pepple as a
whole in matters of taste." "It is the duty of the
schools so to lay the foundations of character in the
young that they will grow up with reverence for the
majesty of law. Any system of school discipline
which disregards this obligation is harmful to .the
child and dangerous to the state."
AT the close of the convention of the National
Educational Association at Boston there was
adopted unanimously a series of resolutions
setting forth what the educators of the country desire
and what they, aim to attain. The resolutions were
embodied in what was termed by the convention
"A Declaration of Principles," and are deserving of
attention thro';gnout the country.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
MEN who are well acquainted with Alaska have
repeatedly asserted that- thousands of .acres
of the Territory are sufficiently well adapted
for agriculture during the short summer as to pro
duce food enough for a population running up into
the millions. These assertions have been sustained
in messages by the Governor and in official reports
from various agents of the Federal Government in
the Territory. They have been received by the pub
lic, ignorant of Alaska, with varying degrees of
credulity or incredulity. It would seem, however,
that the experiments in the growing of grain and
of many kinds of vegetables have now been carried
so far as to fully substantiate the assertions of the
Alaskan boomers.
It will be remembered that during his address at
Seattle President Roosevelt, predicted a great future i
for Alaska and asserted that men now living would
see the Territory as populous as some of the largest
American States. Unaffected by reports that furnish
ample justification for the prediction of the President,
the Springfield Republican, like a good many other
New England papers that have no conception of the
Pacific Coast", ridiculed the speech and suggested
that the President did not know what he was talking
about, or else had reached a degree of Western en
thusiasm that rendered him indifferent as to the ac
curacy of what he said.
The mocking words of the Republican reached* in
due til^ie the people of Alaska, and the Bonanza
Record has sent back a reply. The Record says:
''Both the coast and interior of Alaska contain more
agricultural land than the whole population of Mas
sachusetts ever saw. ; It is better and richer land than
ever existed in Massachusetts even in the days when
Miles Standish was fighting Indians ind Roger Wil
liams skipped out for Providence, R. \. The sun does
not hang low in the summer time, but on the con
trary it shines in on "these 'desert' fields of Alaska
and the Yukon from four different directions â north,
east, south and west. Every kind of vegetable that
can be forced into existence in Massachusetts gtyws
here with greater luxuriance than anywhere in the
world. To the local readers of the Record it is not
necessary to enumerate them, but since a marked
copy of this paper will go to the inner sanctum of
the Republican office it might be stated briefly that
the list includes lettuce, radishes, beets, cabbage, po
tatoes, carrots, turnip?, parsnips, spinach, oyster
plant, parsley, celery, cauliflower, onions, cucumbers,
gourds, mushrooms, oats, wheat, barley and several
kinds of hay."
Pausing at that point to take breath and to cut
short a list that began to look like a compendium of
rural products, the editor resumed by saying: "This
U only a partial list, but enough for a man whose
brain is reached by the ordinary avenues for trans
mitting intelligence. There are thousands upon
thousands of acres of such land, and it is as vacant* as
the day Christopher Columbus strode up the beach
of San Salvador or when Julius Caesar crossed the
Rubicon. The editorial writer of the Republican
must have served the most of his life as the hermit
of a 10-acre hay ranch near the town of Springfield."
The exuberance of that language will of course in
cline the reader to srnile, but it is not altogether the
language of exaggeration, unless all Alaskans have
united in a great trust to support and swear to each
other's lies. Again and again the agricultural pos
sibilities of many sections of Alaska have been tested
for a series of years, and the results have justified the
prediction of the President. Gold is by no means
the only valuable mineral of Alaska, and her people
will not always be dependent upon imported foods.
Like the rest of. the Pacific Coast, it is a land of
wonders, and some day it will demonstrate" the wis
dom of those who are trying to develop its resources,
exploit its mines and cultivate its soil. Â¦ â¢

SAN FRANCISCO being the largest port on
the Pacific, and one of the great transfer
points of travel around the world, it is riofsur
prising that frequent attempts at smuggling dutiable
goods are detected here.\
But there is smuggling and smuggling. That
which is regarded as so harmful to the revenues
is purely commercial. Sometimes it is embarked in
by regular importers, and flourishes by collusion
with minor officers of the customs service. In such
cases false invoices, undervaluations and other de
vices are used. In this form of the offense arise such
cases as were exposed here in 1890 and subsequent
years, wherein the invoices called for toweling and
cheap goods, but the cases were filled with costliest
fabrics of France, except one, which bore a private
mark designating it to be sent to the Appraiser's
store for examination as a sample of the whole, and
which contained towels. The silk undervaluation
cases now on in New York, discovered by- Appraiser
Wakeman, are a form of smuggling requiring false
oaths and official collusion or carelessness.
Then there is the bold smuggler, who regularly
enters and clears his ship, but lands valuable and
highly dutiable cargo on some lonely spot on the
coast, where it is hidden for recovery by his land
lubber confederates, who put it on the market and
divide the profits. As we have no efficient coast
guard system this kind of smuggling was formerly
very prevalent here. It dealt principally with opium.
The higher the duty on an article the greater is the
profit in smuggling. When the tariff on opium was
$12 per pound, put at that high figure with the pur
pose of excluding it from the country by a prohibi
tive rate, there was no lack of the drug, but very
little of it came in through the custom-house. It was
landed in all sorts of ways. Sometimes it got ashore
in secluded places in small boats, and sometimes it
was protected from the water and thrown overboard
attached to a buoy or float of some kind, to be re
covered by an innocent looking, fishing-boat. Now
that the opium tariff is greatly kss, smuggling it
does not pay. and it comes through the custom-house.
When it was $12 per pound the smugglers could af
ford to lose every other cargo, since they lost only
the first cost of the drug. But at the lower rate the
profit does not offset the risk, and there is every rea
son to believe that but little of the drug is smuggled.
The guide to all detective work for protection of
the revenue is the tariff itself. The merchandise that
pays the highest duty is sure to be the most smug
gled. Under the high schedules of the Morrill tariff
smuggling flourished. The moiety law was passed,
giving the Collector. Naval Officer and Surveyor of
Customs a moiety of the value of smuggled goods
that they could catch. This enabled them to employ
private detectives and use means of detection that
the Government is unable or unwilling to use. But
the moiety law was repealed, it is believed by the in
fluence of the smuggling ring, which was then very
extensive and very powerful, and the freebooters
reveled in profits for awhile, until our lower modern
tariff more nearly equalized risk and profit,
j Another" form of smuggling, of which we hear the
most, is that of dutiable goods in passengers'/ bag
gage. To understand the prevalence of this it is
necessary to explain that smuggling being wrong
only because it is prohibited, and the act of bringing
in merchandise purchased abroad being innocent in
itself, the conscience does not revolt against it, and
the best people will do a little smuggling with no
sense of its being wrong. The ladies, God bless 'em,
are natural-born smugglers, and not one comes from
a trip abroad without hoping to get some dutiable
knicknack past the customs officers free. This is the
kind of evasion of duty that is rife here and at every
j seaport. Passengers make incomplete declaration of
] their baggage or refuse to make any at all, and when
it is searched it is found stuffed with valuable goods.
The temptation to smuggle valuable Asiatic goods in
this way is* very marked. Ladies cannot resist the
j lure of the darling silk kimonas of China and Japan,
nor of the Oriental embroideries, splendid objects of
art, so cheap there and so dear here. So they scheme
and stitch and hide and lie like angels about it. When
detected they are surprised. Their maid must have
put that stuff in the trunk, or a careless husband is
1 berated for it. Then they offer a tip to the in
spector, and when this is refused resort to tears and
get into the newspapers.
But revenue officers have no choice. They are be
tween the two fires, observation by the secret service
and by legitimate importers, who are injured by the
admission free of any dutiable article. The Govern
ment transports plying to Manila have become con
spicuous for the many attempts at smuggling by their
passengers, and army and navy officers and their
wives have shown the. same desire to evade duty on
fine things that is shown by civilians. When it gets
into the papers this sort of smugglers are indignant
and declare th?.t they have been humiliated. A little
common sense will teach them that every reader of
their supposed humiliation would have taken the
same risks under the same circumstances, for no one
regards smuggling as malum in se.
Terpischore. One of the experts whom the world
listens-to.with attention on such subjects has recently
said* "The solemn, wearisome ballet has existed too
long on conventional lines at Paris, Milan, St. Pe-,
tersburg and Vienna. Efforts have been made to re
juvenate it, but it has lost all expression within thirty
years. Who knows that the American dance will not
be established in the academies of old Europe?" .
In that question we have a promise of the future
that may well cause us to lift up our heads in .the
world of art and -.be not ashamed. The old nations
may look down upon our sculpture, our painting, our
music and our. poetry, but when it comes to dancing
they must do kow-tow. America will be known
hereafter not only as the land of liberty and of gold,
but of the cakewalk and the rejuvenated ballet. That
may not be much, but it is something. We have a
specialty. It is not improbable that in his efforts to
please us the Kaiser may'not only patronize. the
cakewalk, but on some future occasion do a turn at
it himself.

fornia garden scene, with palms, all' the
characteristic shrubbery of California,
orange and lemon trees, bright hued flow
ers and growths of wide variety. Foun
tains, winding paths, etc., will add to
the picturesque effect of the garden scene.
As soon as Governor Pardee has .. re
ceived the plans for the California build
ing and finally approved all the details
blueprints will be made and will be for
warded to Isaac Taylor, director of work
at 8t. Louis. He will Inspect the prints
and it is a foregone conclusion .that, he
will ' approve of the building adopted .' as
typical of California. He will then "a 1s
trlbute the prints among contractors and
eo pave the way for the actual construc
tive work.. One of the California Com-
CAUFORNIA GARDEN.
On the ground floor of the building will
be resting rooms for ladies, smoking and
reading rooms for gentlemen, and also
two offices to be used by the Commission
ers nr as committee rooms. The lower
floor will be devoted to the accommoda
tion of the public. On the upper floor
will be apartments for the Commission
ers and their principal assistants.
As much as possible the interior of the
California structure will be finished in
native woods. The California building
will face the north and will overlook all
the foreign section and the principal
buildings of the exposition. To the east
of the building is an avenue, along which
the higher class attractions of the Mid t
way will be located. At the west end of
the site eelected for the California build
ing there are opportunities for decorative
effects. â¢' ;-L "-"
The harbor and shipping of San Fran
cisco will be depicted with moving ferry

rear will each be SO feet long. The main
front, exclusive of the wings, will be 50
feet wide. With the wings added, the
entire frontage will be 110 feet. The
of the bulldinc will be 70 feet. Even to
the bells the Santa Barbara Mission will
be followed as a type. Frank Miller of
Riverside has a collection of mission bells
which the Commissioners suppose will be
available for the purpose in view. Bells
that sounded originally in olden Califor
nia will rinc anew at St. Iwjuis over the
symbol of new California.
Like its model, the California building
will be two stories high, with tower loom-
Ing above the wings. On the first floor
the cloak and parcel rooms will flank the
main entrance. In the front space will
be a large reception room. Back of this
will be a large hall. In this last men
tioned apartment daily exhibitions will
be given free, illustrative of industrial
life in California. The klnetoscope will
be utilized to reproduce scenes In all por
tions of this State.
PROPOSED DIMENSIONS.
* i â¢
IN accordance with the expressed
wish of Governor Pardee, the Cali
fornia Commissioners to the St.
Louis exposition have decided that
the California State building at St.
Louis shall be, with some modifications,
a reproduction exteriorly of the Santa
Barbara Mission. The style of architec
ture will not be changed. Instead of one
wing there will be two on the front of
the building, of uniform length. On the
rear will be two similar wings, so that
the structure will follow the outline of
a cross. Above the arcade contained In
either wing a balcony will extend the en
tire lensrth of the wing, which will be
supported by columns, as shown in the
accompanying picture, which Is the first
that has been given to the public.
Several designs were submitted by the
Commissioners to Governor Pardee, who
has the final decision In the selection of
the type of building. Governor Pardee
said that the mission type of architec
ture was best represented by an actual
mission structure, and he deemed the
Santa Barbara Mission the best model to
represent California at St. Louis. All
the plans submitted last week have been
returned. Four architects are now con
sidering the problem of interior arrange
ment principally, as the exterior is nxed.
The interior space will be apportioned to
suit the convenience of the public and
will not follow the Santa Barbara Mis
sion.
SALT LAKE, Utah. July 16.â Within
ten days contracts will be let for the con
struction of 135 miles of grade between
Calientes, Nev., the present southern ter
minus of the lines" recently acquired by
the San Pedro Railroad, and Daggett, the
point on the Santa Fe to which the com
pany has track privileges. A statement
to this effect was made by J. Ross Clark,
second vice president of the road, who ar
rived in Salt Lake to-day from New
York. Clark said:
It is our Intention to push the construction
work with all possible dispatch. The specifi
cations will contain a clause requiring the con
tractors to commence work- almost Immediately
and setting a time limit of considerable less
than two years for Its completion.
I believe the contractors will be able to
finish their work within ten months. As soon
as we get work startf-d on these sections con
tr cts S for the remaining lÂ«i miles of grade
will be let. The entire distance will be graded
and tracked and trains' will be running from
th Â£_ clty to ljOB Angelis within two years.
ine material for the construction of the
,2â¢ klch lnclu <Jes 30.0CO tons of rails and
l.. Wi. 000 ties, has been purchased and is being
shipped to. Calientes and Dasgett as rapidlv
as possible. The. equipment for handling ma
terial and carrying on the work at both ends
has also been purchased and is ready for use.
In fact we are now In excellent shape to
push the work along without any delay.
"As I noted, the President Is deeply inter
ested In this proposed legislation, and it Is his
hope and desire that early action may be
taken by Congress to remedy existing financial
conditions."
"An extra session 1e to be called to meet on
Monday, November !>, Immediately following
the fall elections. This session will be called
primarily for the purpose of enacting legisla
tion approving; the Cuban treaty, uhlch was
ratified by the Senate last eprlnir, and the
President hopes that we ehall be able to
take up for early consideration financial legis
lation alone the lines of his messages and
his *j>eeches."
"Did you discuss with the President any
epecinc financial measure?"
"No. not at all. No specific bill was under
consideration. The preparation of a measure
of that kind is the work of Congress Itself.
It was Understood when the Senate adjourned
last spring: that the Committee on Finance
would prepare a remedial financial measure
during- the recess. The committee tow is en
gaged on that work. I assume that the House
Committee on Banking and Currency also will
take up the subject, but I am riot informed
whether Jt Is the Intention of that committee
to begin consideration of the matter before the
extra eeeslon shall convene.
Senator Lodge arrived here this morn-
Ing and passed the day with the Presi
dent at Sagamore Hill. He is a member
of the Alaskan Boundary Commission,
which is to begin its sessions in London
early In September. Before sailing for
England to-morrow on the steamer Cedric
he came to Oyster Bay to consider with
the President among other things the
work of the commission. He left this
evening for New York. Before his depar
ture Senator Lodge gave out a statement
concerning his conference with the Pres
ident. In this statement the President's
hopes regarding the financial legislation
are reflected.
OYSTER BAY. L. I., July 16.â President
Roosevelt Is deeply Interested In proposed
finanlcal legislation. As a student of af
fairs he has noted for a long time the
necessity of financial legislation of a re
medial character and to-day he expressed
to Senator Lodge of Jlassachusetts his
desire that early action upon the subject
be taken by Congress, along the lines of
his recent messages ajid speeches. In
deed, it can be said that he hopes action
Trill be initiated at the extra session of
Congress, which he will call on Monday,
November 9.

HIGH-CLASS HOUNDS TO
COMPETE AT INGLESIDE
In one of the old Christian frescoes. In
dicating a' baptism, a man Is represented
as pulling a fish out of the water. Ram
say tells us that lt was customary In Asia
Minor in the second century f or . the
Christian to use this symbolic language.
It was hardly safe, then, for them to
speak openly '.- of their faith in Christ.
They were accustomed to wear rings with
the fish sign as a signet, much as we
wear symbolic â¢ badges to-day. One day
two men met, neither aware of the faith
of, the other. One, without saying Va
word, traced with his- stick 4 the- figure of
a fish .' In the sand. The other quickly
burst out in assertion of his Christian
faith, for! the fish symbol had declared
the " other's allegiance to Christ.
So tho word "lchthus" came to stand
for a Christian, and it was used as a
mark of Christianity. "It was not only
sculptured on burial monuments, but came
to be used on various utensils. A great
many terra cotta lamps have been found,
especially at Spalato, on which is found
the impress of tun flsh. Many of these
"lchthus" lamps are found also in Rome.
The word "fish" came to be used also
to describe a Christian, and to call a man
a fish was equivalent to calling him a
Christian. . ; '
The symbols upon early Christian mon
uments, of which so many have been dis
covered this last century, are curious and
Interesting. One of the most frequent
is that of the fish. The figure of the
fish is used, and also the Greek word for
fish, says Dr. A. W. Patten, who has
looked into the subject. Ramsay, in his
excavations In Asia Minor, has found
some very Important Inscriptions in
which the fish signs are frequent.
But why was lt that the early Chris
tians used this sign? The reason will ap
pear when we remember that they found
In the letters of the Greek word for fish
an acrostic on the name of the Savior. The
word Is "lchthus." Each letter of the
words in the original Greek begins one
of the words In the following phrase:
"Jesus Christ, Son of God, the Savior."
THE MEANING OF THE
SIGN OF THE FISH
Why It Was So Often Used as a
Symbol by thÂ© Early
Christians.

WE ABE TO HAVE ONE
WOODEN WABSHIP
Farra gut's Flagship, the Hartford,
Sole Survivor of Her Class, to
Be Betained.
Those who delight In war and blood
shed, with their accompaniment of thrill
ing stories of heroic deeds, or those, even
who would have all international end do
mestic controversies settled by arbitra
tion, have reason to rejoice that when
Congress, a few years ago, had inserted
a provision in the Naval Appropriation
bill that repairs to all wooden vessels
should be discontinued, it excepted the
famous old ships Hartford and . Kear
sarge. Since then the Kearsarge has met
the fate of so many other ships, having
been wrecked .on a reef In the Caribbean
Sea. But the old Hartford, In commis
sion, with her officers and crew on board
and in their distinctive and fascinating
uniforms, and the ship with her lofty
and symmetrical masts and spars and her
sails furled, and every rope In place, has
been most interesting to visitors during
her recent visit to the navy yard. 8he
Is now on the records as doing duty in
the Coast Squadron and has left the navy
yard and gone to Annapolis.
The old ship is a different looking ves
sel, so far as the interior is concerned,
from the one which Farragut commanded
at the battles on the Mississippi River! In
1862, and at Mobile Bay In 1S64. And yet.
although there is little left, of the old
ship beyond her keel and frame and
name, she has not lost her outward iden
tity, and any of those who were familiar
with her in the days of the Civil War
would recognize her now. She was orig
inally a steam vessel, or sloop-of-war, of
2900 tons displacement, and was built at
Boston in 1855. She has the same grace
ful and symmetrical lines that she pre
sented on that hot summer day when she
led the wooden fleet past the guns of Fort
Morgan, in 1S64, at the battle of Mobile
Bay, when Farragut won another of his
great victories and coined the phrase
that has gone Â«tlown into history, when
he called out to thd commander of the
Brooklyn (who had hauled his ship out
of the line when he saw one of the mon
itors go down by an explosion of a tor
pedo). "Damn the torpedoes; go ahead!"
The famous old ships have all gone ex
cept the Hartford, and she is destined to
remain afloat so long as she can be kept
In a seaworthy condition, so as to remind
the present and future generations of the
kind of ships and the manner of men
their ancestors were in the days when
men and ships were needed to preserve
the ntition.â N. Y. Tribune.

ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS, N. J., July
16.â After a forty-mile leeward and wind
ward race off Sandy .Hook lightship to
day Shamrock III led her trial horse to
the finish line by six minutes and thirty
seconds and won by only fifteen seconds
less. In the first half, of the race the
cup seeker dropped Shamrock I at the
rate of sixty-live seconds and more to the
mile, but during the run to the outer
mark the older boat was the first to catch
a new breeze, which sent her along at a
pace that slleed nearly three minutes off
the challenger's lead.
It was a clear fluke, which, as usual in
a run before the wind, favored the stern
boat. Shamrock III had beaten the other
by nearly two minutes in the first run to
leeward, so that the challenger must have
lost about five minutes by the fluke. In
all she covered twenty miles of windward
work seven minutes and eighteen sec
onds faster than the challenger. From a
nine-knot breeze at the start the wind
dropped to three knots at tne finish, but
held west-northwest all day. Summary:

CHICAGO, July 16.â Through a sensa
tional stretch run at a time when he
seemed helplessly beaten. English Lad
won the Hyde Park Stakes at Washington
Park to-day by a head from Auditor,
which was the same distance In front of
Flo Bob. Flo Bob was the best horse,
but Wonderly swung him wide on the
stretch turn and he lost more ground
that he was able to make up. Flo Bob
was favorite at 5 to 2, and was heavily
played, while English Lad did not lack

these two. Summary:

Three nice little blngles, coming at the
right time as they did in the sixth round
of yesterday's battle at Recreation Park,
put Uncle's followers one to the good.
After that the Senators never had a look
in, so the game came to end with the
score 4 to 3.
'Twas a snappy contest, full of ginger
and life. The Senators fielded perfectly and
never let a ball get away from them
when it left the bat of the home club
bers. But they were in a quandary when
ever they faced Jimmy Whalen. In only
one round could they do anything with
the stick. Then they made three, but
three were not enough to win out with.
Whalen was In the real form nearly all
the time and pitched ball that would go
in anybody's league. He had a burst of
speed every once In a. while that was the
genuine stuff and his curves broke away
so fast that seven of the Senators hit
nothing but wind in their vain at
tempts to line the ball out of the lot.
With Irwin on third in the fourth round,
Thomas forgot himself long enough to
make a wild pitch, which let in a run.
Then all was tranquil till the Senators be
gan to get into the going during the sixth.
McLaughlln singled and Egan bunted.
Irwln threw the ball wide to Pabst and
McLaughlln scooted around to third and j
Egan alighted on the middle sack.
Sheehan tore a torrid one past Delmas
and both runners landed at the rubber.
Then Hogan made good with another out
to center and this brought Sheehan home
with the last run -of the game for the
Senators.
The home talent made its gallant stand
in its half of the same round. Shay was
given a pass to first, but Meany forced
him at second, and the prospects for three
runs were anything but bright. But Ir
win sent Meany down to second with a
nice drive to right field and Tommy
Leahy brought him home by smashing
the leather to the same place.
Irwin landed on third and he and Leahy
neatly worked the double steal. Pabst's
out by the short and first process scored
Irwln and a moment later Graham let one
of Thomas' swift owa go through him
and this was enough to let Leahy amble
hor. - with the last run of the game. The

The following were chosen by President
Alex Truman to serve as an executive
committee:
A resolution waa also passed which de
clared that a list of those eligible to
serve as delegates from the district
should be presented at the next regular
meeting in order that twenty-five may bo
selected.
Resolved. That this club favors the nomina
tion by the Republican municipal convention
of a Republican of unquestioned party alle
giance as our candidate for Mayor. We makÂ»
thl* declaration, not becauÂ«e of any personal
opposition to any candidate for the office who
may be Identified with Â«ome other party, but
because we belitv* in the Republican party
and In ltÂ» ability to vrisely administer the af
fairs of the government and because we be
lieve no one but a representative Republican
should receive the nomination from this party.
A meeting of the Regular Republican
Club of the Thirty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict was held last night In Hamilton Hall
on the corner of Geary and Steiner
streets, at which resident Republicans of
the district signed the roll of the club,
bringing the membership up to the 400
mark. The following resolution 4 was
passed, as representative of the senti
ments of the club in respect to the nomi
nation for Mayor:
THIRTY-EIGHTH DISTRICT.
There was a full attendance last even-
Ins at ihe headquarters of the United Re
publican League of the presidents ami
vice presidents to the advisory council
and executive committee members to tha
central executive committee from all the
district clubs. During the session, which
lasted for several hours, a series of sug
gestions were made to promote the suc
cess of the league and to insure victory la
every district at the primary election.
The meeting was full of enthusiasm and
the -representatives from each district
were called upon In turn to give a true re
port of the political situation in their
respective districts.
To-morrow evening the Fortieth Assem
bly District Club, affiliating with the
United Republican League, will hold a
rally at Franklin Hall, corner of Fillmore
and Bush streets. An excellent literary
and musical programme Is being ar
ranged. The committee has invited Dun
can E. McKInlay, George H. Bahrs. R. H.
Countryman, P. A. Bergerot, John 3.
Partridge. E. I. Wolfe. George A. Mc-
Gowan. Merton C. Allen, A. Ruef. Daniel
A. Ryan. T. D. Rlordan and Carey Van
Fleet to speak. The well-known singer,
Sam Booth, has promised to entertain In
addition to other singers and musical ex
ercises.
The Republican municipal convention
to be held September 13 will not be short
of material for the ticket. Several of the
present local office holders of the party
are already In the field for renomlnation
and the list of new candidates for the fa
vor of the convention is dally growing
larger. There is promise of an interest
ing contest for the lucrative office of
Sheriff. Indications are that many dis
trict delegations partial to the indorse
ment of Henry H. Lynch will be success
ful at the primary election on August 11.
Mr. Lynch Is well known throughout the
city. He is popular and has influential
friends in every one of the eighteen As
sembly districts. He is openly in the
field as a candidate for the nomination
of Sheriff and If he does not succeed in
winning the prize his supporters will be
greatly surprised. It is common political
gossip also that the party leaders and
organizers hold to the opinion that Lynch
as the nominee for Sheriff would
strengthen the ticket and brighten the
prospects for victory at the polls In No
vember.
UNITED REPUBLICAN LEAGUE.
CHICAGO, July 16.â McChesney will
meet Waterboy, the Eastern crack, in
what practically amounts to a match
race on July 22 at Brighton Beach. E. E.
Smathers, owner of McChesney, received
a telegram from Secretary Boden of the
Brighton Beach track, offering a purse
of $10,000 for a meeting between the two
colts. As match races are forbidden by
the Jockey Club, the rules call for a field
including three-year-olds and upward.
Smathers wired his acceptance.
McChesney was shipped East to-night
to be prepared for the race. Everybody
here thinka McChesney will win easily
and on the day of the big race Middle
Western turfmen will never stop betting
on the big fellow until the starter raises
the barrier. Not in years has any equine
champion so completely won the con
fidence of his followers, and local experts
do not see where Waterboy will have a
ghost of a chance to win. It is believed
that, should McChesney not go amiss in
the East, he will go to the post a top
heavy favorite.
NEW YORK, July 16.â The conditions of
the race between McChesney and Water
boy are as follows:
Championship special at weight for age, for
horfeps three years old and upward, by sub
fecrlptlon of $G<K> each, or $50 If declared out
by i: p. m., on Tuesday, July 21; the associa
tion to add MO.000. WateTboy and McChesney
to start or no race. Good weather and track;
one and a quarter miles.
ab Sam Hildreth, the trainer of Mc-
Ch^Bney, Is In bad standing with thÂ«
Jock?y Club here, Smathers probably will
turn the horse over to Frank \ Taylor.
"Jack" Joyner, trainer of Waterboy,
wagered $10,000 that Waterboy would
Â¦win. A telegram was at once sent to
Chicago notifying Smathers, who wired
to accept and take as much as was offer
ed, the money to be put up to-morrow at
the track.
The Championship Special probably will
be the greatest racing event run in Amer
ica. The betting is expected to be the
heaviest ever known in the ring, as Sma
thers will be offering his money until the
barrier is sprung, starting the two cracks
on their Journey. . >.

Professor Robert Herrick, who writes
books and criticizes, Is not at all perturb
ed by what the lady school teachers at
tending the summer school at the Uni
versity of California are saying about
him. He goes sailing on In his smooth
way, altogether indifferent to the side
remarks and burning thoughts about him.
It makes no difference to him whether a
school ma'am thinks" him too cruel for
anything, for he goes right on picking
the manuscripts to pieces and Haying
their aspiring authors alive.
Professor Herrick has a few favorite
phrases that he uses industriously in his
classroom criticisms. "That is positively
illiterate," "This is ludiorous, indeed,"
"That is the worst ever written."
"I think Professor Herrick Is unneces
sarily cruel," 6ald one of the martyrs,
who does not want her name mentioned,
to-day. "He does not make allowances
for those poor unfortunates who are so
infinitely Inferior to him. It seems to me
it does not become a man teaching Eng
lish to use such a vulgar word as 'cock
eyed,' as he did yesterday. It is certainly
indelicate. Oh, he Is such a cruel man."
Professor Herrick prefers to say any
thing he has to say In the classroom, not
to newspapers, so the dear public may not
know his private opinion, publicly ex
pressed, of the genus co-ed.

When a mere lad I had often heard it
said that the eating of onions and lem
ons was a protection against contagious
diseases, and when about 13 years of age
I had an opportunity to teat them for
myself. I had spent the winter in the
city of "SfiW Orleans, where in the spring
yellow fever of a virulent type made Its
appearance, causing an urgent demand
for nurses, and having faith in what I
had heard of the protective power of
onions and lemons I concluded to take
what my friends called a ghastly risk
and made application at the "Common
Street Hospital" for a position as nurse,
was accepted and entered at once upon
a line of duty, in commencing which I
began the use of raw onions and lemons,
alternating weekly with lemons, always
taking them Just before going to bed.
I took no other remedy, although medi
cine was provided every morning for all
attaches. At the expiration of the tenth
week I was no longer needed, and left
in as vigorous health as when I entered
the hospital.
On taking my departure I waa remind
ed by the head physician that his medi
cine had probably preserved my health.
Nevertheless a number of nurses and at
taches had died of the- fever despite his
vaunted medical ability. Before leaving
the Institution I acquainted the doctor
with the fact I had not used his medi
cine, but had relied solely upon my
onion-lemon treatment, when he said it
was a wonder it had not killed me, and
if it had that I had deserved it
During our Civil War I had a similar
experience with smallpox cases in Wash
ington, L>. C, finding the onion and lem
on a perfect protection to myself and
many of my associates.

A prominent government official who
has returned from a visit to Palm Beach.
Fla., tells about seeing a huge man-eat
ing shark that was captured at that
place. It was one of the biggest sharks
ever caught in Florida waters and was
evidently a sailor of many years. The
animal measured over, eighteen feet In
length, had a sword attachment that was
as long as an arm and was of the leop
ard variety, stamping it as one of the
man-eating variety, a dangerous beast.
The shark was caught by a shark fish
erman. He used a large rope for a line
and had a windlass as a reel. At the
end of the. line was a huge steel hook
and this was baited with a large bright
tin can. The shark bit at the bait and
was entrapped. He was landed after the
roughest time the fisherman ever experi
enced. It was the Interior of the fish,
however, that excited. the greatest Inter
est. When he was cut open a whole por
poise was found in the stomach. There
was also a large piece of partly digested
shark and the head of an ostrich. The
piece of shark Inside the monster was
out of the back and contained the back
bone of the dead animal.
A careful examination showed that the
backbones were larger than the back
bones of the captured shark. A number
of scars on his body ehowed that he had
been in conflict with another shark and
the finding of a piece of the adversary
showed that the conflict had ended in the
death of the opponent: that the victor
had then swallowed a juicy portion of his
adversary. The presence of the ostrich
head in the stomach of the man-eater
was regarded as undoubted proof that the
shark had probably just arrived in Flor
ida waters from Africa and that he had
made the trip In two or three days. The
head was not digested and the process
of digestion had only just begun. -There
is only one ostrich farm in Florida and
when that institution was communicated
with the owners said that they had not
lost an ostrich in a year. The ability of
a shark to pass a fast steamer in one
minute's time is well known to travelers
and there is no doubt that the shark had
been in African waters and had captured
a stray - ostrich or the head of one that
had been killed and then started across
the. Atlantic, reaching the Florida waters
before the ostrich head had begun to di
gestâBaltimore Herald.

W. H. Miller, supreme master workman
of the Ancient Order of United Workmen,
arrived In this city from St Louis, Mo.,
yesterday for the purpose of explaining
to the membership here, and later on to
that of the California Jurisdiction, the
new plan of rates adopted at the recent
session of the supreme body of the order.
He was tendered a reception In Stelnway
Hall last night by a number who were
interested In the matter, but the audience
was not as large as those who had ar
ranged for the reception expected.
The meeting was called to order by
Grand Recorder C. T. Spencer, who Intro
duced Grand Master Workman Dr. F. W.
Browning, who made a short address,
after which he presented the supreme
master. The visitor explained at length
the new plan, which he said had been
prepared after a most careful examina
tion of statistics from all jurisdictions
and applying the results to the mortality
tables. He said that a condition confront
ed the order that made necessary a
change In the manner of conducting busi
ness in order to meet obligations prompt
ly. He said that while the rates had been
increased on those above the age of 55
years, they had been fixed at what it
actually costs to carry the risk, and that
at tne same time the younger members'
rates had been so adjusted as to make
them come within the lines that will
make them bear an equitable share of the
risks.
The supreme master workman denied
the raise of rates was for the purpose ot
"freezing the old men out," but said that,
on the contrary, the Supreme Lodge did
everything to keep- them in by providing
several plans, under each of which they
may retain their membership.
The new system in detail will be sent to
every member of the order.

decided upon it will not be because of
any hope of saving the patient's life, but
simply for the purpose of rendering the
death agony less acute.
"His Holiness had during the night
some hours of sleep, together with short
periods of slight excitement. The level
of the pleuric liquid is maintained In the

Seventy school teachers, who some time
ago filed their notices of withdrawal from
the Alameda County Teachers' Annuity
and Retirement Fund Association, were
allowed to draw out of the organization
to-day, taking with them an aggregate
of about $5000 from the fund. By an act
of the last Legislature they were permit
ted to do this, providing they filed notice
of withdrawal within a specified time.
The board of commissioners, consisting
of Supervisor Mitchell, County Treasurer
Feldler and Superintendent Crawford,
represented by his deputy, met to-day and
considered the list and authorized the
Treasurer to pay out of the fund the
amount each teacher who had filed notice
of intention had paid into It, and war
rants for these amounts, aggregating
$5000, were signed.
The association was organized in 1S97
and had enrolled about 140 teachers, who,
by the rules of the association, paid in $1
a month. At the end of a certain num
ber of years they were to be entitled to a
pension. Between $11,000 and $12,000 has
been contributed with the interest the
money has drawn. The many withdraw
als have cut the membership in half and
left only about $7000 in the fund. . It is
hoped, however, by those remaining In the
organization that the scheme may still
be made a success. Those who withdrew

has arisen among the townspeople over
the arrest of Colonel R. R. Thornton qn
a charge of shooting Frank Pursell. Tqo
residents have taken sides and the opinion
is that there will be trouble because of
bitter feeling:.
The premllminary examination of Col

swer a charge of assault to commit mur
der. His bond was set at $2500. He was
also placed under an additional bond of

In whose saloon Thornton was found aft
er the shooting, and who is very friendly
with the hot blooded Southerner, was held
to answer as an accessory in bonds of
$1000. Thornton's friends declare that he
was brutally beaten by Pursell and one-
White, a brother-in-law of Pursell. The

Is quarrelsome and had goaded Pursell.

On the Associated properties, on the
other hand, all is life and hustle. It is
claimed that there is something doing in
Inner circles of the great combine. It Is
now believed by many well Informed per
sons that the Southern Pacific is Inter
ested in the suit filed against the Asso
ciated by the - Shamrock Oil Company,
and If Harrlman takes over the properties
of the combine It will be because this has*
been settled and Harriman Is convinced
that the association can give a clear title to
all the property held by It on the lease,
whether the same was ratified by all or
only two-thirds of the stock of the com
pany absorbed. There has been some dif
ference of opinion among lawyers on this
point and It is intimated that Harriman
instigated the Shamrock suit to test the
question, which is one of the greatest
Importance, for many of the combine's
holdings are affected.
The canceling of the orders for drilling
on the Southern Pacific property is said
to indicate that the company feels as
sured of a sufficient supply of fuel from
the Associated, which is now drilling
fifty additional wells on Its properties.
That Harrlman has virtually secured
control of the Associated is generally ac
cepted as a fact. When asked the of

question and will not positively affirm nor

BAKERSFIELD, July 16.â The Southern
Pacific has canceled orders issued for
extensive drilling operations on its prop
erty at Kern River and McKlttrick. The
company was contemplating and had
given orders for .drilling twenty-five wells
at Kern River and ten at McKlttrick,
but all this has been called off and it is
eaid that this action is due to the fact
that the Harrlman syndicate will very
Bhortly take over the control and man
agement of the Associated Oil Company,
of which it controls a large part of the
stock.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
In view of these telegrams the opening
of hostilities, which was improbable yes
terday, appears inevitable now.
It seems to me to ask under theÂ«<e circum
stances that the double traitor Ferrera be In
cluded in the exercise of mercy Is the height
of Iniquity. Shaking to you in sincere lan
guage so that you may realize for all time that
I prefer the triumph of the principles of Justice
at all cost, guarantees cannot be granted to
FYrrera by one who upholds above all else
truth. riKht. Justice and e/julty.
Referring to the last paragraph of your
telegram regarding the fulfillment of your duty,
ir is neither for me ncr for you to Judge who
have done their duty: that remains to pos
terity and history. Ycur countryman,
OIPRIANO CASTRO.
The foregoing suggestion does not in any
way involve a manifestation of weakness either
on the part of the self-denying and heroic army
I have the honor to command or on my part,
for If unfortunately we are net able to arrive
at an honorable settlement my army will know
how to do its duty. With epteem, I remain
NICOLAS ROLANDO.
General Castro replied last night as fol
lows:
If you were really an honorable and patriotic
nan >ou would not have entered Into this revo
lution of a most unjustifiable and criminal na
ture, not only because of Its entire lack of
motive, but because of the connivance H has
had with the enemies of the country or, which
is the same thing, with foreigners.
I desire to avoid shedding blood, which must
prove sterile in view of the exceptional circum
stances in which the revolution is placed. After
having agitated the public for upward of two
years it wem* that you have an opportunity
of terminating the long struggle by the exer
cire of a little i>atrloti?m by guaranteeing the
perynnal liberty of General Ferrera. who, ac
cording to Vice President Gomez, is the only
cbftacle. and authorizing the latter to accept
a formal treaty Instead of unconditional sur
render as he desires, which is also another
otstacle.
"Yes. for every one except the traitor
Ferrera. the author of so many tears and
the cause of making so many orphans."
The final period of delay given by Gen
eral Gomrz for a definite answer to his
request for the surrender of General Ro
lando and his followers expires to-day,
but President Castro, wishing to save the
lives of the inhabitants of Ciudad Bolivar
and to avoid the horror which must fol
low the storming of the city, ordered Gen
eral Gomez not to open fire if he is not
attacked, but to simply besiege the city.
The revolutionists, having no provisions,
canm.t resist more than ten days. The
Venezuelan man of war Bolivar has left
for the Island of Trinidad to brine pro
visions for the Government troops. .
Tile armistice expires at midnight.
The United States gunboat Bancroft and
the French cruiser Jouffrey arrived dur
ing the afternoon.
The Associated Press correspondent has
secured copies of telegrams exchanged
between the rebel leader Rolando and
President Castro, with respect to a con
ditional capitulation of the insurgent
forces. The following Is General Ro
lando's dispatch to Castro:
SOLEDAD, Venezuela, July 16.â The at
tack on Ciudad Bolivar by the Venezue
lan Government troops, which appeared
imminent yesterday morning, has been
deferred at the request of United States
Consul Henderaon > Herr Brokmen, # the
German Consul, and the Bishop who
transmitted to President Castro, through
General Gormz. the commander In chief
cf the Government forces, a long tele
gram asking him to be magnanimous and
to show mercy to all if the revolutionists
surrender. It is known that the Presi
dent answered as follows:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Broadway, July 16.
Hurled from a bridge and beaten by
thug?, who robbed him of his money, was
the experience last night of James Can
non, a Livermore farmer, with a trio of
highwaymen, at the Alameda Creek
bridge between Nllea and Centervllle.
The three desperadoes hammered their
victim on the head and face after throw
ing him Into the bed of the creek, and re
lieved him of $15. Then the brutal foot*
pads fled. Cannon's crle* attracted tha
attention of passing ranchers, who went
to the Injured farmer's assistance. Hear
ing his story, they hastened to Nilea and
notified the authorities. Constable Rod
erick went In pursuit of the thugs and
captured two of them on the Irvtngton
road. They gave their names as John
Stearns and Frank Godress, and were
identified by Cannon as of the gang that
had assaulted him.
Stearns and Godress were arraigned be
fore Justice Powers at Irvington this
morning on a charge of highway robbery
and their preliminary examination was
set for Tuesday.
Cannon told the following story:
I had gone to "Silts for a lay off after work-
Ing at Livermore for some time. Meeting ths
men in a saloon. I bought several drinks with
them and later started out on the road and
they followed me as far as the bridge. Sud
denly I was grabbed and pitched over thÂ»
bridge, landing In a heap In the dry bed of thÂ»
creek.
Then the three jumped on me 'and beat ms
terribly. I yelled. "Take my money, but don't
kill me." Passers-by heard me, and the men.
after taking (15. ran off. I got back to Nlles
and went out with the constable to find my
assailants.
Cannon's face was hacked and he had a
dozen scalp wounds.

The second day of picturesque political
maneuvering in the convention failed to
culminate in the final grand surprise of a
winning dark horse, whose coming had
been hinted at and whose followers dur
ing yesterday's pessions t=et the political
manapers to guepsing. Colonel Morris B.
Belknap of Louisville, a wholesale mer
chant, widely known throughout the
country, received the nomination for
Governor on the first ballot. His dele
gates, contrary to predictions, stuck to
him. though how much of their tenacity
can be charged to the announcement In
former Governor William O. Bradley that
he was not a candidate can only be con
jectured.
Bclknap was nominated after an en
thusiastic supporter of Bradley had placed
the former Governor in nomination and
the followers uf Augustus K. Wilson had
tacitly withdrawn the man supposed to
Vie Beiknap's nearest competitor by fall
ing to present his name. The threatened
s-iampede to Bradley was quelled by an
emphatic declaration that he would not
be a candidate, but for some unknown
reason the convention officers called his
name during the ballot and he received
Ji greater number of votes thap Clifton J.
Pratt, who had made an acffve canvass.
The resolutions, after congratulating
the people of the United States upon the
"unparalleled prosperity achieved under
rational Republican policies," says:
ROOSEVELT IS INDORSED.
Â¦*\> Ftand for the continuance of listing Re
publican firÂ»ar.ciÂ»l ..:.: tariff policies.
We txrress our htchrst appreciation of thÂ«?
record that President RoosevÂ»!t has madÂ« in
continuing the grrat work bosun by William
McKlsVy and la himself dealing with the new
j>robleiri* that he has had to solve; la his han
dling of the rhllippine question: in his firm
management of the Venezuelan crisis ; in his
wife and ecurajfeous course with reference to
the anthracite coal strike; In his honest ef
forts to e*eurÂ«- justice to Cuba: in his zeal for
the Panama canal; in his vigorous demand for
official purity and honesty and jiuntehment of
the enrruj't ar.d dishonest; in his resolute stand
bÂ£ainÂ«i the elohintc of Chinese port* to our
trade; in the ruccess achieved bv his practi
cal efforts to enforce the law against unlawful
combination ami by the encouragement he ha*
iriv^n to ilw iaying of a cable across the Pa
oiflc, which brine* us into closer touch with
the Philippines than we w*>re with the Louis
iana territory or with California when acquired.
He has ehown himflf a strong executive, as
to is an ideal cit!zÂ»-n. and we heartily and en
thusiastically are for his nomination for the
J 'residency in 1VKM.
We denounce assassination and lawlessness,
whether in t^rvia or In Kentucky, as de
structive of civilization, and call upon the en
lightened intelligence of the State, through its
legislative, executive and judicial agencies, to
employ rem'tiles to re-establith order and pun
ish crime within our borders.
We especially arraign the present State chief
executive for so exercising the pardoning
power as to eubperve j>olitical and partisan
iwiljtoâ . with the certain effect of encourag
ing crime by virtually rendering criminals of
J'emocraiic political faith immune from pun
ifhir.en'.
BELKNAP IS NOMINATED.
Nominations for Governor were reached
late in the afternoon, when the names of
Clifton B. Pratt and Morris B. Belknap
were offered. Wilson's backers did not
impend when his Congressional district
was called. The surprise came when the
Eleventh District was called and State
Senator Kash arose and sprung the name
of a dark horseâ former Governor Wil
liam O. Bradley. The speech was a mas
terpiece of natural oratory of the fervid
Kentucky style, and moved the delegates
to a wild demonstration. Bradley finally
tiuellfd the tumult by shouting: "I have
declared for four months that I would
rot accept this nomination. I am a man
of my word, and while I thank my friends
1 adhere to my original resolution. I will
rot be a candidate for Governor."
A negro delegate provoked wild enthu
siasm by a word in praise of ex-Governor
"W. 6. Taylor.
When the ro'.l call of counties was start
ed the name of W. O. Bradley was re
tained. As the ballot progressed it showed
that Bradley drew the Wilson strength
and part of Pratt's strength, but failed to
materially affect the Belknap vote, and
by the time three-fourths cf the counties
had been called Belknap had received 1147
votes, or twelve more than enough to
nominate. Many counties that had voted
for Bradley and Pratt then began chang
ing their votes to Bclknap. Just before
the roil call was completed Judge Pratt
withdrew his ramp. The nomination of
Eelknap was then made unanimous. After
his speech of acceptance an adjournment
Â¦was taken, and the rest of the ticket was
completed at the night session.

the Protet arrived here the privilege of ferry
ing visitor* to and from the cruiser xas given
to- one boatman. In return for this exclusive
right the boatman turned over to Commodore
Acilgard a commission on the tolls exacted
jrom passengers, and everything promised well
for the monopoly until the other hoatmen and
French residents and citizens who approached
the cruiser in boats not control!*-! bv the
trust and were turned away showered th-s

modore's commission, it is said, was to be
turned over to the French Benevolent Society
but as never a navy ship of any nationality

they came aboard the charitable feature failed
to appease the wrath of the excluded boatmen
atnd those of thÂ« French colony who had bÂ«Â»n
turced away from the cruiser from their na

him the commodore referred to lhe French
Consul, who in turn referred to the commodore
all that registered kicks at the consulate. The
outside boatmen waited on the Protefs com
mander yesterday for the purpose of coming
to an understanding which would give all en
*qual chance. Thle visit seems to have been
tbm laat straw. The desire to aid the French

STOCKTON. July 16.â Carl Nelson, a
Swede, who recently came here from San
Francisco, commit ie d suicide to-day in
the Receiving Hospital. Nelson bad been
laced in a straitjacket and his arms were
strapped to his sides. Notwithstanding
this he loosened his hanis, unbuckled
the strap, tied one end about the bed
rail and the other be buckled around his
neck. Then he lay down and strangled
himself to death. The body was found by
a hospital attendant a few minutes after
ward.
Special Pispatch to The Call
The bodies of Dr. Rogers and one of the
women have been recovered. Workmen
are searching for the others.
The fire was first discovered at 2 o'clock.
Thirty minutes later there was nothing
except the foundation standing. The
building was three stories high and con
tained sixty rooms. Loss about $20,000.
DR. A. E. ROGERS, the steward.
The flro started in the laundry, at the
west end of the main building, and
reached the roof of the main structure
before it was discovered. â¢ A light wind
drove the blaze into the halls and rooms
on every floor. â¢ The entire building was
filled with smoke before the inmates,
some thirty in number, were awakened.
A nurse, Payne by name, went into the
hall and heard Dr. Rogers calling for
help. Payne broke the^loor open and led
Rogers part of the way down the hall. He
reached the porch only to find that Rog
ers had not followed.' Later it was found
that Dr. Rogers had stopped to save a
woman patient and was himself burned to
death. All those who were burned were
evidently first suffocated, as none was
heard to scream.

noon, with a decline In Alaska Packers to
|149 and rather lower quotations for the gas
stocks. For Bank of California *525 was bid.
The oil stocks, were also dull.
In the afternoon there was some activity In
Spring Valley Water, the stock rising from
$S4 23 to $S6. The company has declared a
dividend of 42c. payable on the 20th. The
special meeting of the shareholders on Wednes
day adjourned until July 29 without voting on
the question of transferring the property of
the corporation to the new Spring Valley
Water Company. There was no opposition to
the proposition, but lt was considered neces
sary to secure a fuller representation of the
capital stock.
An assessment of V, of 1 per cent has been
levied on the 1901 Oil Company, to become
delinquent August 15.

There Is an active general trade, however.
Â¦ and the prospect of a continued good scalping
- market. There Is no important change in the
present conditions. Cables are dulL The
Â¦ yields of winter wheat, with exception of the
> extreme Northwest, continue disappointing,
and to a considerable extent are sensationally
so. Weather in the Northwest is on the whole
favorable to crops and the trade Is coming to
the conclusion that the spring wheat crop will
be less than last year. The movement of
1 wheat to primary markets Is very small. In
â¢ dications are that it will continue so. The ex
. port demand is moderate. On the other hand,
domestic millers are urgent buyers of : wheat
' In the Southwest markets, and to some ex
1 tent, in this market. The premiums for de
1 slrable wheat are stiff and well maintained.
â¢ We see nothing in these conditions- to warrant
; expectations of any great profit for short sell
1 ing. We think we would much rather buy
! wheat on the breaks. The world's stocks are
, extremely small and the accumulation lÂ£ likely

â¢ Provisions.
Chicago was much lower on the day. This
market continued dull and without feature. The
Chicago letter of Bolton, De Ruyter & Co. said:
"The wild advance in Lard at the close was
I an accident. It came through the execution
of large stop orders, which only became oper
ative within the last five minutes of the ses
sion and when it was too late for 'would-be
sellers' to get their orders Into the pit* Gen
erally speaking, there ls.no Improvement In
the legitimate situation in provisions. Receipts
of Hogs are liberal, demand poor. Think they
should be sold-on the rallies."

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. July 16.â The early sentiment in
the wheat pit was bearish, due to the unsat
isfactory condition of the money market, the
weak feeling in stocks and the labor troubles,
and prices responded to selling pressure from
commission houses after a steady opening,
with September Vic lower to Vic higher. Early
n3es were at a decline to 7Â«Vic. but buying
by St. Louis scalpers and Â«ome commission
houses caused a reaction and sent the price
up to 77Vic Sentiment was divided, however,
and on tiie prospect of Increased movement
and good grading of the new wheat crop with
pood weather and absence of foreign demand
the tone became easier again. The close on
September showed a loss of Vac. at 76%c, but
in the race of uncertainty as to the Crop In
the Northwest there was little weakness ap
parent. Trade was active and steady and cf
good volume.
Corn displayed some weakness at the start
on commission house selling, due to the fine
weather and improving condition of the crop.
September being off a shade to VÂ»Â®V4c, but
with the better tone in wheat there was some
good buying by local bulls and the decline was
checked. Movement was not large and there
was some improvement in the cash demand.
Under these influences and with steady cables
the general tone of the market was steady, al
though the close showed September % l SHc
lower, at SO'fec. after ranging between 50V&C
and 50%@50!Â»c. There was a fair volume of
trade.
Oats were generally steady, but were in
fluenced to a considerable extent by the varying
feeling in other grains. Trade was light, with
"calls" selling on a somewhat improved crop
(situation. Local bull?, however, .afforded suf
ficient support to prevent any severe break,
and the close showed September fairly steady
at 33V 4 $33**C. a lors of %@Vac.
There was little demand for provisions and
the market was weak, lard showing a. sham
reaction from yesterday's spurt. The clost
was at a loss for September pork of 50c, while
lard was down 67>4c and ribs 22'4c lower.

cating; here. Eldred Boland states; that

Mrs. Mary E.*Boland, wife of W. F.
Boland, who resides at 408 Cole street,
was found dead in the bathroom of her
fiat by her husband yesterday morning.
Mrs. Boland had retired to her own apart

vious evening. It had been her, custom
to ko to her.husband's room and awaken
him in the morning and, falling to do
this, he went to investigate Â¦ and found
her lying dead on the floor of the bath
room. A strong odor of gas filled the
room and it was found that the gas jet
was turned on about one-quarter; force.

The life of my brother was saddened and
undoubtedly shortened by the troubles In
which ' his sons became involved in this city-
He tried in every way to guide them properly
in their business affairs, but. Richard who
was really in charge of the banks in 'which
the doctor was interested In a financial way
fell in with rogues and they hurried him to
his 'ruin.'. There never was the slightest sus

Donald . personally had anything to do" with

ready said, was foolishly mteled by deslimln*
persons. The father was even dragged Into thÂ»
family trqubles of Dick McDonald? whose Twite
attempted to Â«hoot the doctor. If ever "a man
was deserving of sympathy it was my brother
who found no comfort In the latter days of hli
life and was relieved of his many worries only
when death summoned him.
The doctor did not die suddenly, as first
reported. His death followed an attack of
ptomaine poisoning resulting from his partak
ing of strawberries. He had long anticipated
his death and had made arrangements for his
burial beside the body of his wife in the New
York cemetery.. He had his tomb constructed
and even. went so far as to prepare his own
epitaph. As to his will, all I have heard is
that it is deposited In the Hast He was in
comfortable circumstances, but what the ex
tent of 'his estate' is I cannot say.

In a suit filed late yesterday afternoon
in the United States - Circuit Court, M.
F. Campbell of New York makes a seri
ous charge of fraud against Howard M.
Hough and the Lynde-Hough Company,
and asks for an order of court to re
strain the defendants frcm disposing of
certain mining property of which Camp
bell claims to be the owner.
The complaint sets forth that on Octo
ber 16, 1S99. Campbell was the owner of
the Howard, William and Ryan claims
in Siskiyou County, and of a one-third in
terest in the California Placer mining
claim and the Quartz Hill mine in the
same county, and that Howard M. Hough
owned the remaining two-thirds interest;
that on May 18, 1900, Hough deeded his
Interest to Campbell In those claims and
mines on August 7. 1901. Campbell gave
Hough a power of attorney to sell the
property for him; that on July* 21r 1902,
Hough agreed to sell the same to Raphael
Phillips for $100,000 and 20 per cent of the
stock of a new mining corporation to 5e
formed for the purpose of developing the
property; that two days later Hough de
livered a deed of the property to the
Lynde & Hough Company; that on
February . 24, 1903, the Lynde &
Hough Company executed to Mary J.
Noonan, an employe of the company, a
mortgage upon all the claims to secure
the payment of a promissory note for $12,
000, payable to Mary J. Noonan. ;
The complaint further, alleges that the
transaction was fraudulent and asks that
the conveyance be declared void and that
the Lynde & Hough Company, of which
Howard M. Hough is the secretary," be
ordered to hold the property in trust for
Campbell to the extent of his interest
therein. Campbell also asks for a re
straining order to prevent any convey
ance of the property, and that the Lynde
& Hough Company be ordered to convey
him his interest free.of all incumbrances.

Heretofore all members of the Fire De
partment have been allowed to have pri
vate gongs in their homes free of any
charge if the bells and relay wires were
furnished by those desiring the accommo
dations. Acting on these favorable condi
tions a large number- or. the firemen who
had private homes installed the devices in
their houses.
_As it vis "rumored " among the dis
gruntled firemen, Fire Commissioner John
S. Parryâ who, through his position on
this commission is likewise a member of
the Joint body of Fire Commissioners and
Police Commissioners constituting the
Department, of Electricityâ is responsible
for this action. By his attitude toward
the question of allowing the use of private
fire signals by the members of the depart
mentâfreely expressed before the passage
of .the galling, ordinance by the Supervis
orsâ the ' responsibility for the action is
unanimously traced to his doors.
Yesterday the following communica
tion, sent to all those having the gongs
in their homes, was the first official infor
mation received of the latest work of
Commissioner Parry:
Gentlemen: - Please ' be advfsid "fcu^the

Through his management the Occiden
tal Hotel acquired a wide fame and be
came the recognized hostelry for naval
and military officers and ecclesiastical and
fraternal leaders. Major Hooper's death
is a serious menace to the continued ex
istence of .". the caravansary, ' since the
lease . which he held expired only a few
days before his death and it Is a ques
tion of doubt whether or not the parties
owning the, property will renew it.
Major . Hooper's affiliations were wide.
For years he had been a trustee and
member of Trinity Episcopal Church and
was its senior warden when he died. On
the occasion of the Episcopal general
convention a year ago the Occidental was
used as the headquarters of the visiting
Bishops. He was a member of the stand
ing committee of the diocese of California.
Among the military orders Major
Hooper held a high place. He was a
member of the California Commandery of
Loyal Legion and at one time Its presi
dent. He was also a member of Thomas
Post, G. A. R.

joined the California volunteer regiment
and rose to the rank of major. The reg

Salt Lake, but through his connection
With military affairs Major Hooper laid
the foundation of the wide friendship
with men of the army which came to him
in later years.

PARRY'S TYRANNY
his bell and the pasengers shouted to the
boy to get off the track, but he seemed
paralyzed with fear and paid no attention
to the warning cries. In another instant
the car would have been upon him. Stelz
ner sprang from the dummy and ran for
ward to . rescue the boy, never thinking
of the danger to himself. The gripman
put on the brakes. By this time the boy
had been knocked down by the car and
Stelzner saw only his head and shoulders.
As Stelzner stooped down to seize the
boy he was struck by the car and thrown
to the ground, his legs lying across the
rail. As he grabbed hold, of the scream
ing child one of the front wheels of the
car crushed against his left leg, and with
a heroic effort he swung himself and the
boy clear of the track as the car moved
slowly past him.
Dr. C. H. Carlson, 433 Stockton street,
was a passenger on the car and. he ex
amined the boy, but could find no bones
broken, but thought he might have sus
tained internal injuries. Stelzner carried
the boy to the home of his parents, who
were profuse in thanks, and continued his
trip on the next car and went to the Cen
tral police station to notify Lieutenant
Burnett of the affair. His left leg was
cut and bruised and his trousers were
torn, but he declined to be excused from
duty. When commended for his bravery
he modestly said: "Well, I couldn't see
the boy killed, could I?"
Before Joining the force Stelzner made
an enviable name in the prize ring and
ut that time one of his chief character
litics was his modesty.
VERTIEO SPELL
COSTS HER LIFE
Major Hooper led a varied life. Born
in Richmond, Va., in 1835, he early cast
his lot with the argonauts and crossed
the plains to the West in the first years
of the gold rush. Mining did not tempt
him, however, and he embarked in the
mercantile business on an extended scale.
From a small start the young business
man soon had stores in Tucson, Guaymas,
Mexico, and San Francisco. Later, when
the prospects of business in San Francis
co were at their height. Hooper gave up
his mercantile pursuits and became lessee
and manager of the. Occidental Hotel.
When the Civil War broke out Hooper
With the passing of Major Hooper there
is removed from the sphere of the world's
activities one whose personal worth is
attested to by a legion of friends who
have had the fortune to come under the
kindly Influence of his generous and char
itable nature. There was no charitable
movement of any. creed which did not
receive ready support, from 'him. An ar
dent member of the Episcopal faith, hÂ©
was considered the strong supporter of
Bishop Nichols among the laity of Cali
fornia. His affiliations with military and
naval societies were widespread.
GENTLE LITE CLOSED.
MAJOR WILLIAM B. HOOPER.
for years manager of the Occi
dental Hotel and one of- the
best known and most gen
erally beloved men of this
city, died in his rooms at the
hotel a few minutes . before 11
o'clock last night, after a linger
ing illness of over six months. His wife
and daughters, Mrs. Lieutenant Perry
and Miss Rose Hooper, and his son,
George F. Hooper, who have been ex
pecting the end for many days, were at
the bedside when death came.
The day before Christmas Major Hoop
er was taken ill with kidney trouble and
on the following day the death of his
youngest son, William B. Hooper, Jr.,
served to bow the invalid with an added
grief, until his condition grew serious. An
operation became necessary in the early
months of spring. Though it was a criti
cal one, Major Hooper was temporarily
relieved by it, but so serious was his con
dition that for several months he had
been held a close prisoner by his ail
ment.
POLICEMAN WHO RISKED "HIS
LIFE TO SAVE CHILD FROM BE
ING CRUSHED UNDER CAR.
Roberts will ar>r>ear before Judge Law
lor to-morrow. The crime with which
he is charged is steering W. LÂ». Perry, an
engineer from L*>s Antreles. to 1244 Mar
ket street, where on March 20 he was
tricked out of $80 at a card game.
"I was successful In defeating that writ,
but was promptly served with a writ
from the United States District Court.
Judpe de Haven, who is presiding there,
decided in my favor last Monday, and
that niebt I left Tacoma with Roberts.
His wife was with him all the time and
I could not shake her. She kept the
gamblers of Seattle and this city apprised
of my movements. They put up the
money to keep Roberts in the north. On
the train I learned that a writ had been
procured in the United States Circait
Court at Portland to stop me. I wired
to Detective Day of Portland and he met
me at Klamath. We left the train and
took a beat to Portland, getting off at
a point about four miles from there to
avoid service of the writ. IVe drove to
Orepon Â«.ity to wait for the next train,
but were not long there when Roberts'
friends knew it. They could not serve
the writ because we. were in another
county, but 1 was no sooner on the train
than I learned that a writ had been ob
tained at Grants Pass. I was determined
to keen on the train, and to my great
satisfaction nn attempt was made to serve
the writ upon me at Grants Pass, why
I fion't know."
Ryan aaid that many obstacles were
placed in Ids way by officials and others,
and the only person who assisted him
was Chief cf Police Flagler of Tacoma,
of wfccm he speaks in the highest terms.
"Immediately on rcy arrival," said
Ryan. "I was served with a writ of ha
bt-as corpus, but it went apainst the pris
oner, and I started with him on May 23,
but when I reached lacoma I was served
with another writ from the Supreme
Court. 1 went back to Seattle and had
to wait a month before a decision was
rendered in my favor. The rcmittitur was
held back for a day to give Roberts' at
torneys time to go to Tacoma to procure
a writ from the Superior Judge there, and
whpn I acrain reached Tacoma I was
F*--rved with the writ. I refused to rec
cpnize it. and the Deputy Sheriffs filed
the handcuffs off and forcibly took Rob
erts avrav from me.

Word was received here yesterday from
Chicago that Passenger Traffic Manager
E. O. McCormick, who has been in the
East for several weeks, had started for
home and will arrive in San Francisco
Sunday evening. The prolonging of Mc-
Cormick' s visit in the East is said to have
been due to the threats of the Rock Isl
and officials to cut rates. Up. to the pres
ent time, however, no move ! has been
made' in this direction and the conclusion
has been arrived at by the heads of the
traffic departments -of the Harrlman lines
that none will be made by the rival road.
F. J. Shepard, general superintendent of
the Santa Fe road, arrived from the south
last evening. He is making a tour of in
spection. '
J. S. Noble, superintendent of the Salt
Lake division of the Southern Pacific, and
his bride of but a few days arrived in
this city yesterday and are registered at
the Palace. They are enjoying their hon
eymoon and will remain here several
days. Â¦ â¢ . â¢ â¢
M. D. Shaff, superintendent of the
Cleveland, Cincinnati and St. Louis Rail
way at Indianapolis, and wife are regis
tered at the Palace. They are making a
tour of the West. - Shaff is a brother of
the vice president and general manager
of the road.
ON A HONEYMOON.
The Pacific Coast Railway Club will
hold its regular monthly meeting at the
Palace Hotel this evening, when questions
regarding the care and preservation of
blueprints and tracings will be thoroughly
discussed. The members of the club are
evincing a deep interest in the monthly
meetings, as is shown in the steadily in
creasing attendance.
E. Black Ryan, tax agent of the South
ern Pacific, to whose title his associates
in the railroad building have lately added,
"specialist In franchtsephobia," which the
agent of the road claims Is Infecting the
offices of a number of Assessors through
out the State, departed last evening for
Los Angeles, where the Assessor of that
county is attempting to impose upon the
company a tax claimed to be due on fran
chises of small branches of the Southern
Pacific operated in that section of the
State. The contention of the railroad
there is the same as the one raised here
in .connection with Assessors Dodge and
Dalton's attempt to compel the company
to pay taxes on its ferry service â that is,
that the ferries are part of the entire
Southern and Central Pacific systems'
franchises and that they are therefore
not subject to separate assessments. The
entire matter will be settled before the
State Board of Equalization, which meets
on the 24th.
Among the railroad agents the promo
tions of Buck and Mansfield were expected,
for they are regarded as two of the clev
erest traffic men on the street, and have
through their long service in the Denver
and Rio Grande offices, well merited the
recognition they have received. Buck is
at present local ticket agent of the Den
ver and Rio Grande and Mansfield holds
the position of general agent of the
passenger department of the same line.
RYAN'S TROUBLES MANY.
To-morrow I will make formal announcement
of the changes that are to occur in the clerical
force of my office. I have decided to appoint
Henry A. Buck to the new position of district
passenger agent and will place J. D. Mansfield
In charge of the freight business, with the
official title of commercial agent. The minor
changes that will be made I am not yet pre
pared to elve out until to-morrow.
W. J. Shotwell, who was recently placed
in charge of the offices of the Gould lines
in this city after they were consolidated
by General Traffic Manager A. C. Bird,
returned \ from the East last evening,
where he was in consultation with his su
periors concerning the reorganization of
the business affairs of the companies. His
return has been awaited with much inter
est by the local railroad men, especially
those whose positions were involved in
the consolidation. When asked last even
ing what determination had been arrived
at between the head of the traffic depart
ment â¢ of the Gould lines and himself,
Shotwell said it had been decided that
hereafter the local business of all the
Gould lines shall be transacted through
the agency of the Denver and Rio
Grande, and he added:
GOULD LINE CHANGES.
A. N. Brown, general freight and pas
senger agent of. the El Paso and North
eastern system of the Rock Island road,
who has been a guest at the Palace Ho
tel for several days during his trip over
the coast, arrived at the conclusion that
it would be of benefit to his road to have
a representative here. As a result he
began looking around for a suitable man
for the new position "and finally found
one in the person of C. K. Junkins. con
tracting agent of the Rio Grande office.
Before leaving for the south yesterday
Brown made public the appointment of
Junkins, who will have the title of Pa
cific Coast agent. The idea of an agency
in San Francisco is to build up traffic for
the El Paso and Northeastern through
the El Paso gateway. Junkins is one of
the best known railway men on the street
and his appointment came as a pleasant
surprise to the local agents. He has been
connected with the Gould roads for more
than eight years and was formerly with
the Southern Pacific Company.
