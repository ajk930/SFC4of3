A fact significant of the anxiety pervading the officials at the
Vatican, as well as the Sacred College, is that Marquis Sacchelli,
the high steward of the palace, with his son as coadjutor, and
Comendator Mannucci, who directs the temporal affairs of the
Vatican, are continually in attendance, the last named having the
responsibility of the preparations regarding the summoning of a
conclaVe in the event of the Pope's death.
The condition of his Holiness at 1 1 o'clock last night, though
still grave, was not as serious as late in the afternoon. Dr. Lapponi
administered camphor-caffeine through the mouth, as one experi
ment of injection did not prove successful, Pope Leo saying he
could not bear it. The amelioration resulting from the camphor
caffeine was so marked that the Pontiff called first his nephews
and then his private secretary and adjusted some personal affairs
which are pending.
'Dr. Mazzoni and Dr. Lapponi said at that hour that the
danger of a catastrophe occurring during the night had been
averted. Indeed, they hoped that unless there were heart failure
they would be able to keep their august patient alive for a few
days longer, especialy if he would willingly consent to observe the
physicians-prescriptions. This, however, is the more difficult as
his Holiness preserves his full consciousness and argues and dis
cusses his doctors' prescriptions. The latter, fearing to excite
him by contradiction, are sometimes at jpIoss how to proceed.
Dr. Mazzoni last evening, on his return from the consulta
tion at Pope Leo's bedside, said : .
. "The situation this time is certainly really grave in view of
the great age of the patient and his state of extreme weakness.
However, the case is not yet desperate, especially with a man
having such unexpected reserves of energy and vitality, which, at
the age of 93, are, irfdeed, astonishing. The exact definition of
the Pope's illness is senile adynamic pneumonia, but his
Holiness has not the least idea that he is at
tacked by : any organic disease. In fact, he was not in bed
when- 1 went -to the Vatican, but was seated in his usual arm
chair,' where I am accustomed to see him every time I visit the
palace. He believes the oppression on his chest and the accom
panying difficulty of breathing are merely the results of extreme
power during the interregnum. Later the Cardinal himself went
to the Vatican and had a long conversation with Cardinal Ram
polla. It seems that Cardinal Oreglia will choose as his apartment
the rooms next to the hall in which the Pope usually receives the
congregations of the Cardinals, and which is called the Loggia of
Raphael, from the name of the painter.
Many members of the diplomatic corps called yesterday on
Cardinal Rampolla, including the French Embassador, all
anxiously asking for the latest news.
Baron von Rothenham, the Prussian Minister, showed Car
dinal Rampolla a telegram from the German Emperor expressing
the latter's deepest regret on learning of the Pontiff's illness and
the hope of a speedy recovery, and asking to be kept continually
informed by telegraph about the condition of his Holiness.
Cardinals Gotti, prefect of the propaganda, and Di Pietro,
the prodatary, both had long interviews with Cardinal Rampolla.

respondent: "I expect the catastrophe on Tuesday."
The Pope talked for tzvo hours yesterday afternoon with Car
dinal Oreglia, the Camerlingo, or papal chamberlain, about ar
rangements for the conclave, and it is rumored that Leo expressed a
preference for Cardinal Got Has his successor.
Leo gave injunctions to Cardinal Oreglia until he sank from ab
solute exhaustion. He seemed to be continuing to exhort Oreglia
about the government of the church as he lay almost unconscious,
his voice too weak to make his zvords distinguishable. Oreglia
then formally assumed the government of the church.

SHOOTING IS CONTINUOUS.
Five hundred white men, heavily armed,
are ' marching through 'the streets ' of ' the
city where negroes are likely^ to be found.
Shots are heard constantly.
It is rumored that another negro has
been shot in First street\" '-*
Early" last night, when the mob that sur
rounded the Jail was told that the negro
murderer had been taken away,' a com
mittee composed of five citizens was se
lected to visit the Jail. The mob clamored
for the men,. b,u t the police ; refused to
grant the request. After being in the jail
The steel bars of the Jail windows could
not withstand the rain of blows from the
battering ram of the mob. At 1 o'clock
this morning the crowd swarmed in and
began a search for the murderer. Police
Captain Brennick tried to check their ad
vance by turning the hose upon them.
When he appeared at the window, holding
the nozzle, a rain of bullets was sent
through the window. The captain retreat
ed and no further attempt was made to
keep the mob out.
After the mob had been in the jail only
a few minutes, word was brought that a
gang of negroes was congregating at
Budd Fruit's saloon, at No. 415 Upper
Fourth street, and was' firing from win
dows and the roof upon the whites as
they passed. Â¦
The mob immediately, decided to bom
bard It. A hundred or more armed men.
upon command, fell into* line and marched
from the jail up Fourth street into the
market square, halting in front of Fruit's
place. Negroes were, to be seen at most of
the windows, "but they quickly dispersed
on the arrivel of the mob. Then, upon
command of the leader, a volley of . 100
shots was fired into the building, com
pletely wrecking it. It was known at the
time that there were a large number of
negroes in the saloon. It Is blleved that
many of them were hidden In the large
buildings surrounding the saloon. Several
are reported shot, but no bodies have
been brought In. . ,
negroes are known to have been killed,
and the number of. dead may be .much
greater. One white boy has been killed
by a negro. Among a number of serious
ly wounded victims is a negress. Troops
have been called out and martial law will
be proclaimed. .
The riot started over the killing of a
patrolman by a negro, and later the kill
ing of the white Njv. The mob attacked
the jail and gained an entrance, but the
negro murderer of the patrolman had
been spirited away. Then thousands of
armed whites started in all directions in a
search for negroes. Mobs of blacks met
them at some points and there was
furious fighting, and the colored rioters
overran the poorly protected portions of
the city while the whites were congre
gated on the main streets.
Before the white mob had gathered a
company of negroes armed with rifles
marched through the streets threatening
to kill all whites. They broke into a
hardware store and secured all the arms
and ammunition. Three business men
were fired upon. Then the whites or
ganized for protection and declared they
would exterminate the ' negroes. First
they marched to the prison to lynch the
patrolman's slayer.

WASHINGTON. July 5.â The signifl
"eanee of the gathering of American war
chip; in the Gulf of Pechill becomes more
# r-rarent with the news that Russia has
not less than fifty vessels, including an
entirely new squadron. In that important
.body of Chinese water. While the con
â¢ centraticn of the American naval contin
* gent fn this broad gulf was due primar
ily to the Navy Department's policy to
, keep all naval divisions engaged in
maneuvers, there can be no doubt that
.^this mobilization has a broader meaning
than speaks well for the foresight of
those in charge for the preparations for
any hostile contingency. To say that this
Government is anxious to have trouble
with" Russia over the Manchurian affair
â¢would be far beyond the fact, but it may i
be no exaggeration to assert that the ad
. ministration in Washington intends to
take even' precaution to protect the Far
Eastern interests in which It claims to
â¢have a share.
Bear .Admiral - Koblcy D, Eranr,- com*
mander in chief of the American naval
force on the Asiatic station, has recently
warned the Navy Department that, in his
. opinion, serious trouble is imminent in
China. When the department became
aware that the news of the receipt of
. such advices from Evans was known to
the press, it declined to make any etate
Â¦ ment, but the impression was conveyed
that the anxiety of Evans was with refer
â¢cr.ee to internal uprisings in the vicinity
of Canton and did not extend to a re
newal of the danger of foreign compli
ti,.ions over the choice territory farther
north, upon which some powers have
looked with longing eyes.
. BEAL SCOPE OF WABNING.
Â¦ But. considered In the light of more
recent knowledge, and the concentration
cf practically the whole of Evans' fleet
in the Gulf of Peehili. his feeling of con
cern assumes a clearer meaning. The
i extreme reticence of the naval authori
ty makes it Impossible to say whether
his warning of a coming storm was based
en unrest among the Cantonese or in
Â»formation of intended foreign aggression
in North China, but the suggestions made
by him all point to the latter as the mov
lug cause of his apprehension.
In addition to augmenting the Asiatic
rquadron with the new battle-ship Wis
consin the department is sending to China
the first-class cruisers Albany, Cincin
nati and Raleigh, and significance may be
found also in orders for the armored
cruiser New York, the cruiser Marble
head and the gunboat Bennington, under
the command of Rear Admiral Glass, to
the Aleutian Islands, ostensibly for a
cummer cruise. A glance at the map of
the North Pacific will show how sur
prisingly short is the distance between
the extreme end of the Aleutian group
end- the Gulf of PechHl. The advantage
cf having a squadron in the Aleutians in
â¢the event of international complications
in China would be very great Indeed.
â¢ EVANS' POWEBFUL FLEET.
Evans has in his fleet three separate
rquadrons. two cf them commanded by
Rear Admiral S. Philip Ccoper and Yates
Stirling, and the third, which is the most
formidable, by himself. The squadron
really a fleetâ now in the Gulf of Pechill,
consists of the battleships Kentucky, Wis
consin end Oregon; the monitors Monad -
r.ock and Monterey; the cruiser New Or
leans, the gunboats Annapolis, Don Juan

The interior- of the Vatican during; the early hours of -this
morning testifies ,to the conviction that the passing of Pope Leo is
very near." The courtyard of St. Darriaso- is filled with the car
riages of the Cardinals. Cardinal Satolli drove to Rome from
Frascati:iast, night, the beautiful carriage horses, covered with
dust and perspiration.; In .the cortile are drawn up the- carriages
o f the' Cardi nals and o f : many n otables. Servants and messengers
hurry across -the court with. bundles.of huge, wax tapers and with
the robes of the ecclesiastical "dignitaries who are v waiting : within
the palace. The; antechambers of the palace were all through the
night "j thronged' with princes of 'the {church, ': high noblemen and
members of 'the : diplomatic corps. Telegrams . of inquiry have
been received from several, of ,the monarchs of Europe.

about three hours, until 'excruciating pain brought the dying

was not there-. Dr. William" Gilbert, the
chairman of the committee, tried to calm
the assemblage, but his â¢ voice was
drowned by shouts of "Go, get the nig

the negro had been removed from the city.
The crowd shouted, "Death to the ne

all the negro prisoners Indiscriminately.
The race war started late last night,
when a little boy named Logan was shot
in the leg by a negro. An unknown negro
woman was killed and several negroes
were seriously wounded. The entire po
lice force H stationed at the jail and the
negToes are taking possession of the
town.
The race riot was the immediate out
come of the shooting of Patrolman Mas
sey on Friday night by Lee Brown, a ne
gro. Brown and anbther negro had en
gaged in n quarrel and Brown had sworn
to kill his antagonist. He ran toward
his home to secure a revolver, and Patrol
man Masses', hearing of the trouble, lay
in wait for Brown. As the negro came
back, armed, hunting fcrr his enemy, Mas
sey stepped from a doorway and laid his
hand on Brown's shoulder. Brown turned
quickly and shot the patrolman in the
abdomen. The officer, as he lay on the
sidewalk, fired atxBrOwn .a.nd wounded
him dangerously. He fell ktifT the' two

At 2 o'clock this mornlnR tne crowds on
the streets are increasing and firing can
be heard In all directions. Disorder and
rioting are everywhere and every one of
the thousands on the street is carrying
his life in his hands. The police are be
ing cheered for numerous arrests of the
negroes they are now making. Every time
a negro is taken into custody the police
are applauded and hundreds of people
are following the wagon. A whole patrol
wagonload of nfgroes was picked up on
Water street a few minutes ago and
about 300 shots were fired as they passed
up Main street. The mob Is still going

Whites are looting hardware stores to
obtain weapons. At First and Sycamore
streets an attack was made on the store
of Boetticher & Kellogg. This was re

who declared that the store contained no
more guns. The crowd then passed to

fact that is vouched for by Secretary- of

"When, recently, I traveled^ ,wtth ; the

that they might not even takoyoii?' 1 . '
"The question had never presented it

Dying Pontiff
y ONDON, July 6.â The morning pa

J*'* from Rome concerning the conditlqn
of the Pope. T)ie consensus of opinion of
the correspondents is that the aged Pon
tiff can live but a few hours, though there
is some hopejhat his extraordinary vital,
ity may prolong life even to some days.
The Rome coreepondent of the Daily
Chronicle says:
"Dr. Mazzoni tells me the Pope Is
gravely ill with pneumonia, which affects
the lower and middle lobes of the right
lung. His Holiness is in full possession
of his mental faculties."
Dr. Mazzoni says there is a bare possi
bility of the Pope's wonderful recupera
tive powers saving his life, or at least de
ferring death for several days. Never
theless the physician apparently enter
tained pessimistic forebodings.

ent says an eyewitness returning from the
Vatican at midnight described as a most
moving scene the grandeur of the Pope's
participation in the last sacraments and
the wonderful composure with which the
Pontiff received from the doctors the in
timation of the gravity of his illness. T'ne
Informant said:
"Although ihe Pope himself feels worse
than ever in his life, he is optimistic and
has not entirely given up hope. Noting
the eagerness displayed by the doctors,
his Holiness himeelf ordered the last sac
rament, wishing to play his part of sov
ereign of the church to the last and re
ceive the final consolation while in full
possession of his faculties. Before par
ticipating in the rite the Pontiff bade
farewell to the pontifical courtâ the cen
tral figure in a setting which unfolded
the whole gorgeous pomp of the Vatican."
The London newspapers in their leading
articles this morning unstintlngly eulogize
the dying Pope, "whose bedside, irre
spective of creeds. Is a center of melan
choly interest to the whole Christian
world."
The Daily News says Pope Leo has
done something to bring back the papacy
to the position which it held during the
best days in the middle agesâ the position
of arbiter and peacemaker In Europe. He
is battling against death- with. the serene
and cheerful fortitude which has been the
keynote of his life.
The Daily Telegraph saya:
"His saintly character and blameless
life appealed even to those who most
strongly repudiate his spiritual claims.
He has conferred a luster on his life akin
to that which the office conferred on him.
The whole world prays that he may en
ter painlessly into rest."
Other papers have articles in the same
strain, all accepting the belief that re
covery is Impossible.

ASSEMBLING OF WARSHIPS,
Â«eakneÂ«s. As soon as be saw me,
his Holiness repeatedly* requested me to
turn my attention to the best means of
restoring his strength, which, he said,
uas all he required except a little fresh
air. Now and then the Pope has recourse
to his inveterate habit of snuff-taking,
raying that he finds It very refreshing.
"The weakness of the patients pulse
f.nd his short and irregular breathing,
frraflually approaching to gasping, are the
only external symptoms of any serious
rature, but, as I said before, the Pope
this morning was full of spirit and would
ret take a grave view of his own case.
When I left him his Holiness ea!d:
'* 'Come again, soon. I will try to give
jou a better reception.' "
LAST SACRAMENT GIVEN.
During the afternoon the strength of the
Pontiff began to fail him so rapidly and
hit condition became so critical that it ap
peared that only a few hours of his life re
mained to him. It was. therefore, deemed
wise to advise him of his grave condition,
tnd thit was done with tender precau
tion. Pope Leo was thus prepared for his
la*t communion, which was administered
ftt night, with the participation of all the
Cardinals now in Rome and the whole of
the pontifical court.
The solemn yet gorgeous ceremony of
administering the last sacrament took
X>lace at the bedside of Pope Leo. The
central figure was the dying Pontiff,
whose long life's journey is nearly over,
calmly preparing to enter the dark valley.
His pale and emacifcted face, ajmost as
white as the pillows on which it rested,
ehowed little sign of life except the keen,
glittering eyesâ always his most striking
feature.
Around the bed were grouped the Noble
Guards. In their glittering uniforms; the
Knights of the Cloak and Sword, in their
picturesque mediaeval costume of black
rvith white ruffs; twenty-five of the Car
dinalsâaJl of the members of the Sacred
College who were present In Romeâstate
ly and venerable figures In their sweeping
crimson robes, the whole forming a ecene
of rich yet eubdued coloringâ a fit subject.
for the pencil of Rembrandt. The whole
ct what is called the pontifical family,
headed by Cardinal Rampolla and includ
ing all of the private chamberlains, were
I there. Nearest to the bed stood the im
posing, tall figure of the Cardinal grand
X enitentiary. Serafnno Vannuttelll, with
the Pope's confesor, to hear the last con
fession of tfce departing Pontiff.
SCARCELY A TEARLESS EYE.
The priest apostolic approached, bear
ving the viaticum, to give the last com
munion and the extreme unction, assisted
by the grand penitentiary. Pope Leo
feebly recited the confession of faith as
formulated fcy the Council of Trent, and
â¢ finally tha words of absolution and the
formula of indulgence In articulo mortis
were solemnly pronounced by the grand
penitentiary. The heads of the great re
ligious orders who were present granted
tlie Pope the special indulgences which
ihey have the privilege of conferring.
[ Then came the touching prayers for a
passing soul and part of the Gospel, "The
Lord's Passion." As the last words died
away all fell upon their knees.
The Pontiff, raising his transparent fln
Â£Â«rs with a feeble effort, pronounced in
scarcely audible words his benediction on
the Sacred College and on all present, and
thea sank back on the pillows.
There was scarcely a tearless eye in the
whole assembly; the sobs of the Popes
relatives were plainly heard in the deep
eilence. broken now and again by mur
mured prayers or a pious ejaculation.
In a portion of the loggia of Raphael,
adjoining the papal apartments, were th9
families of Count Riccardo Peed and
deretanding had been reached in regard
to Russian claims In China.
The correspondent adds that a well-in
formed official informed him that the
Chinese policy of Count Lamsdorff, the
Russian Foreign . Minister, is based en
tirely upon detaching America from Eng
land and Japan. This, he said, was no
easy matter at the outset, and now,
thanks to Count Casslni's bungling, it ap
pears to be quite unfeasible. The Russian
Government will now be compelled to
fight or knuckle down, and at no period
In Russian history have the Russians
been less willing for war than now. If
America is resolved to play the part of
slewing partner in the Anglo-Japanese
alliance much Russian money that had
been spent In Chinese and Manchurian
schemes will be thrown away and Russia
must begin anew. Of actual war, the
oniclal added, there was not the remotest
likelihood, however much Russia may lose
at the green-table of diplomacy, v^vi-i

The candidates chiefly spoken of are
Cardinal Rampolla and Cardinal Seraflno
Vannutelli. They are both representa
tives of the conservative policy, but are
bitter antagonists of each other. Cardinal
Rampolla is < a very warm Francophile,

probable liberal candidates are Cardinal-
Bishop Agliardi and Cardinal-Priest Sa-
Thei first question the Cardinals wifl
have to solve will be whether the con

Italy. Â¦Â¦ It is believed that the supporters
of thfe Idea of abandoning Rome will be
even fewer than in the conclave held
after the death of Pius IX, when thirty
two out of thirty-seven Cardinals voted
in favor of Rome. The second question
will be .whether -the nÂ«xt Pope must be
an Italian or a foreigner. It is generally

gation, and now announce it' as their
opinion, that the man was murdered, but
by whom and for what motive they admit
they have not even" the remotest idea:
He was seen onAlameda street by a
policeman, and as the officer approached
him he was suddenly seized with convul
sions. He said he had just taken a glass
of beer in a near-by saloon, but had no
other drinks. He was eating candy which
he said a friend had given him, but did
not say who the friend was. He was hur
ried to the hospital and every effort made
to get a connected story of his move
ments, but before he could tell more he
suffered another spasm and died.
It has been established that his death
wag due to strychnia, and it is believed
the poison was contained in the candy, a
partly filled- box of which was found in
his possession. It Is now in the hands of
a chemist for analysis, and several <*>tec
tlves are trying to ascertain where lÂ»Ion
tljo got it.
It was learned to-day that he had a
number of relatives in this city, and all
of them assert that the deceased was not
a drinking man, that he had a good posi
tion in Riverside and that no known rea
son for suicide existed. If the dead "man
had enemies who desired his death his
relatives do not know It. He had some
money, and one theory of the police Is
that some person put poison In his beer,
hoping to render him unconscious and
then rob him, and knowing nothing of
the strength of the poison, used too much.

President Moyer Says it Will Not Be
Necessary to Call Out thÂ© ./Y1;;
Miners.
DENVER,, July 6.â James B. Grant,
chairman of the executive committee of
the American Smelting and Refining Com
pany, estimates the damage at the Grant
and Globe smelters caused by the,unex
pected strike of the employes at $25,000 to
$30,000. All but (wo of the elefen furnaces
in use were "frozen," and the ore ' will
have to be cut out before the furnaces
can again be used.
President Charles F. Moyer of thÂ©
Western Federation of Miners says that
he does not think it will be necessary to
call out the miners of the State in sup
port of the smeltermen. The failure of
the Legislature to pass an eight-hour law
is given by the strikers as the cause of
the trouble, and the company Is accused
of using Improper means to defeat legis
lation. A large force of police is guard-
Ing the smelters in this city, and no se
rious disturbance has occurred, though
twelve men have been arrested for dis
orderly conduct and making threats.
WHEATLAND, July 5.â The dis
astrous blaze that began here
yesterday afternoon was un
dqubtedy-caused by flrecrack-
Â« ers in the hands of small
boys. The scene this morning was one of
ruin and desolation. Where stood block
after block of substantial brick business
houses and costly homes nothing re
mains but ashes and smoldering debris.
On account of the celebrations held in
this city and at Lincoln nearly all the res
idents were absent and few men were
available to fight the flames. Almost at
the start the water supply, which is fur
nished from large tanks and by pumps
driven \ by electric power forcing water
into six-inch mains, became exhausted
by reason of the power line burning and
the tanks not being filled.
Handicapped as they were, the volunteer
firemen put up a strong fight, but to no
avail. A heavy wind was blowing from
the southwest and burning brands were
carried over the town that was doomed
and soon In flames in many sections. The
entire block, of brick, fronting. along the
railroad tracks,, was destroyed with the
exception of the I. O. O. F. Hall and a
portion of the Farmers' Bank building.
The following are the losses as near as
can be ascertained at this time:

Besides these enumerated, a great many
suffered damage to household goods by
removal and breakage.
Many people are homeless, but are being
cared for by the more fortunate neigh
bors. The town to-day was thronged with
people from nearby towns viewing the
ruins. The burned district will probably
all be rebuilt and some are waiting only
for losses to be adjusted, when building
operations will begin.
building and many landed through the
skylights, but with hard work this was all
extinguished.
The warehouse of cnopius & De Geus
across Third street Jrom the .Devereaux
warehouse was not so fortunate, for the
cinders which fell on the roof soon started
the dry shingles burning.
The next building lost was a small barn
-used by Lee Brothers & Co., truckmen,
for storage of hay. Five dwellings were
the fuel for the flames next! TMe tan
bark sheds, full to their capacity of tan
bark, with D00 cords belonging to the
tannery company, were in the path of the
flames and were lost. The stables of the
tanning company were also destroyed.
Then Santa Rosa Creek stopped the flre.
Across a narrow street to the east of
the Cnopius & De Geus warehouse,
which was burned, were the foundry and
machine shops of F. J. Yandle. When the
flames reached that warehouse the wind,
â¢which had been blowing a terrible gale
from the northwest, changed to a more
southerly course. This was the means of
saving these buildings, together with
many residences in the block. The Santa
; Rosa Tanning Company's plant was
thought by all to be doomed, and if it had
gone the Grace Brothers* brewery build
ings would also have gone, as the two
plants are very close together, but the
, change of the wind was a help in the sav
ing of these.
The California Northwestern Railway's
loss will be $90,000 and consists of the two
buildings, freight and cars. It is under
stood that no . Insurance was carried by
the railroad company. Station Agent Will
Spridgens, who lived with his family in
the second story of the passenger depot,
lost all of his household furniture and
wearing apparel, only escaping in the
nick of time. His loss will be about $1500.
He had small insurance. The Western Ho
tel was the 'property of John Doda of
Fort Ross and the valuation Is placed at
about $8000. It was occupied by B. Cot
tlni. It was insured, for $3000. The loss
at the Devereaux warehouse was only
about $100 and Is covered by Insurance.
The loss Cnopius & De Geus' warehouse
Is estimated at more than $20,000, includ
ing the goods in storage.
The Bruner and Redmond dwellings
were insured- for small amounts. The
dwellings "belonging to the tanning com
pany were Insured for about $600. The sta
ble is a loss of about (500, together with
$100 worth of hay. Tanbark is worth about
$20 a cord an- the GOO cords destroyed
makes a loss of about $10,000. All of the
tannery property was insured for about
one-half of its value. !'"Â£';"*

SANTA ROSA, July 5.â The most
destructive Cre which has ever
visited Santa Rosa occurred here
this afternoon 'and the less will
amount to ever $125,000. It burned
over four blocks of territory. If the wind
had not changed its direction when it did
the loes would have been still greater, as
the large plants of the Santa Rosa Tan
nery and Grace Brothers Brewing Com
pany were In the direct line of the wind
until It changed its course.
The largest loser Is the California North
western Railway Company, In whose
freight depot the fire utarted. The pas
senger deoot was coon In flames, and,
â¢ritb. the help of the strong north wind. It
was not long before the Western Hotel,
across the street, was a mass of fire.
From there the destruction continued un
tii Santa Rosa Creek, four blocks dis
tant, was reached. Only the brick ware-
House of E. W. Devereaux was saved
along this route of flame.
The fire was discovered by children
who notified Conductor Frank Burns at
the passenger depot. He at once ran to
the corner of Fifth and Wilson and
turned in an alarm. In ten minutes the
entire building was ablaze. Much freight
belonging to local merchants was de
etroyed. Five loaded freight cars which
.were etanding on the Biding alongside the
building were also destroyed.
From the freight building the flames
tpread across to the paseenger depot and
there was nothing: left of that in a few
minutes. The scarcity of water retarded
the firemen in their work, and It was not
long before it was evident that the West
ern Hotel was doomed. The next build
ing: in the path of the flames was the
fireproof warehouse of E. W^ Devereaux.

LONDON. July 5.-The reeling on the

be cheerful. A more hopeful situation
which set in duriner the previous week
continued and the whole list showed de
cided Improvement, especially the gilt
edged securities^ which are deriving bene
fit from cheaper money. While the at
mosphere was clearer, the prospects of a
continued improvement in prices, espe
cially of investment stocks, are very good,
the public as yet showing no great de
gree of eaÂ«ernesÂ» and consequently the
volume of business done last wck waj
small.

CHEERFUL TONE PERVADES
LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE
. But. as just observed, a better tone seems to be de
veloping. It was remarked in this column several
weeks 2go that the great New York banks, deeming
ihe long liquidation in Wall street practically over,
were not averse to a i ally, and were in fact rather will
ing to help along a little bull campaign. The fact is,
tile financial interests of the country have swung
from ore extreme to the other, and from being over
sanguine a year or so ago have become pessimistic
to the other extreme. One condition is about as bad
2s_ the other. There is nothing to be pessimistic
about at present, and the future can take care of itself.
The country is still prosperous and likely to remain
'.so with a little watching on the part of its guides
iand guardians.
In this connection Henry Clews, the New York
banker, who is probably as close to the powerful
moneyed interests of the country as any other man
who keeps himself thoroughly posted on the daily
course of the stock and financial markets, and there
fore speaks by the card, says:
"Wall street continues in a conservative and some
what hesitating mood. For conservatism there is
'still good reason, while for the extreme pessimism
that prevails in some quarters there is absolutely now
no justification. The average buyer of stocks forgets
that many of the depressing factors which now influ
ence him have been recognized by shrewd operators
weeks and months ago, and that these conditions
have been largely, if not over discounted by a decline
of 30 to 40 points in many of the leading stocks. -Just
now we are in danger of running into a state of exces
sive pessimism, which is quite as hazardous as the un
reasoning optimism which induced all sorts of excesses
in 1901-2. When desirable securities begin to sell be
low instrinsic values, not good but harm follows from
forcing prices to a lower level; for confidence is un
necessarily disturbed, enterprise checked and disaster
invited which reason and judgment should prevent
What is especially needed at the moment is careful
discrimination. There is rm excuse whatever for an
undue loss of confidence when corrective influences
are actively at work and the financial situation has
been greatly clarified by the enormous liquidation of
the last six months. There are still undigested securi
ties in existence, but these are generally in strong
hands, where they are likely to remain awaiting con
ditions much more favorable to their distribution
than the present." J
There is no change in the important food or mer
chandise staples from a week ago. Adverse weather
is catting down previous estimates of the wheat crop
in Europe and the United States, and last week's hot
north wind has materially altered the aspect' of the
fruit and grain yield in some parts of California; but
ihc general trade situation remains as for some weeks
fcack.
?vstem
IN the liveliest times the Fourth of July week in
trade is always dull and featureless, and last week
\\i* no exception to the rule. Outside of Wall
\treet there was nothing new worthy of comment,
and even in that fecund nest of sensations matters
\vere decidedly xame. There were fluctuations up and
'down. -but as the week advanced the market devel
oped a better tone, though business was lacking.
Private wires received in this city from stock oper
ators there said that the great bulk of the liquida
tion was probably over, that crop news was better,
and that the tone of the financial situation was un
doubtedly much improved.
Still, there is a cloud hanging over the market in
the form of the regular moving of the trops in the
fall, which will require the usual large blocks of cash,
and although the bank?, both at New York and
Chicago and even in the West, have been providing
reserve* for this movement for some time it is recog
nized that th? gre?t bulk of the burden will after all
fall upon the New York banks. This tends to create
more or less anxiety regarding the course of the
money market later on, and causes more or less hesi
tation in finances. This periodically recurring appre
hension over the autumn money market will continue
'until the country adopts a more elastic currency

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
For the time' being, the critics won the victory.
The/play â¢ was a failure from a monetary point of

man culture could becarriqd to this country by Prus
sian lieutenants of the guard and diffused throughout
society by waiters in restaurants. At any rate they
refused to accept the play. They declared it to be
a "sensations stucke;" and advised the German pub
lic and German theater managers to have nothing to
do with it. \ , .. '
"We still cherish a prejudice against American art.
As a Â¦matter: of fact we can hear them say 'And must
this come too' when we recall the sky-scrapers of
Chicago, the ugly "architecture of the cathedral on
Fifth avenue and the transatlantic theatrical pieces
with which we have already become acquainted. On
the other hand we have been aroused to enthusiasm
in this very playhouse.. but .a short time ago when
.MifsrS.arah Duneafc .of OatifdrniVapfpeardrbefore us
and succeeded in elevating to ideality and -the
esthetic the most sensual of all forms of art dancing.
It showed us that even in the country across the
ocean, with its enmity for all fine forms' of art and
its dilettanteism in art. they are beginning to awaken
thoughts and ideals which are new to even the old
lands of culture on this side*. Does it not seem as
fitting for an old Prussian squire to emigrate to
the United States in order to teach the cowboy there
how to manipulate the lasso? Yet it is true that
former Prussian guard officers and lieutenants grace
New York restaurants as waiters to-day. Perhaps
the spirit of culture is conveyed to the United States
and grows there just as the steer is raised in the far
West and we receive canned beef from the New
World."
AMERICAN invasion of Germany began with
an export of wheat and corn. That was,
quickly followed by an "invasion of canned
meats and dried fruits, and ere long we* were filling
their markets with Â¦ manufactured goods. Each suc
ceeding form of the invasion roused a new set of
defenders of the home product, and the fight against
us became more and more vigorous and bitter. Still
the invasion swept along, hindered at times, but
never beaten back, until now we are attacking the
very citadel of German culture by invading their
cities with American art, amusement and entertain
ment.
â¢ The first notable invasion of the latter kind was
the appearance in Germany of the American "Wild
West Show." It attained a triumph that encouraged
other showmen to venture, and soon the American
circus was parading the fatherland like a conqueror,
and American vaudeville stars were illuminating the
nights not only of Berlin and Hamburg, but of all
the cathedral cities and university towns. Their ad
vance was so swift that within a comparatively short
time after their first appearance they won their way
to the innermost centers of culture; and when a'
short time' ago an|American cake walk was given at
the palace of the Kaiser, American genius had a
right to 'say,"! came, I saw, I conquered."
The latest sweep bT the invasion has taken the form
of the introduction of American drama on the Ber
lin stage. This movement appears to have aroused
everything stalwart in Germany, and we learn by re
ports from Berlin that the critics and the high mas
ters of culture and of art are raging like Valkyrs
screaming for slaughter % and urging on the fight
against the insolent invaders of the classic stage of
Germany. The reports inform us that after the first
night of a presentation of an American play in Ber
lin the critics roared next morning that the play is a
proof that American dramatic art is in its swaddling
clothe?, that;-when the situations of the play are not
ludicrous they are pathetic, but not with the pathos
the author intended; and that the whole piece in con
ception, style and rendering is but a barbarism.
The manager of the theater wfio was induced to
give our art a show on his boards deemed it neces
sary, in announcing the play, to make something of
an apology and a plea for mercy in doing so. It is
reported that on the programme for the first night's
performance there was printed a statement running
thus: i ."
A BLAST FROM BERLIN.
The completion of the battleship Mis
souri at Newport News during the pres
ent year, and the Ohio some time during
1904. will leave thirteen battleships-ln
clutllng three! 13,000-ton ships not yet
placedâ to be completed between 1903 and
1&07, in addition to which there are eleven
armored cruisers to be finished within
two, three and four years. Only one bat
tleship, the Connecticut. Is building in the
New York navy yard, two battleships
and three armored cruisers in trust yards
and the remainder are distributed among
six independent private yards, on the -as
sumption that contracts for the three bat
tleships will be placed with Newport
News, Cramps' and the Camdcn yard.
Therefore, if additional ships are to be
laid down during the next two years the
Navy Department will be forced to utilize
the navy yards. An additional battleship
can be built at the New York navy
yard and two at each of the yards at
Boston, Norfolk and Mare Island.
There is a huge gong in the office of the
Chief of the Bureau of Navigation which
has not besn used . for several years, of
which the fallowing good story is told how
a civilian got revenge on a martinet of
ficer: Captain F. M. Ramsay was super
intendent of the Naval Academy from
1SS1 to 1886, and during part of this pe
riod James R. Soley, a professor ln the
navy, was head of the department of Eng
lish studies. Ramsay, while a capable of
ficer, was a perfect martinet, and above
all things delighted to show his authority
over the unfortunate civilians under his
control. Soley had a very unpleasant
life for about a year, when he managed
to set transferred to the library. In a
few years the wheel of fortune brought
about a changed condition, Ramsay be
came Chief of the Bureau of Navigation
and Soley was made Assistant Secretary
of the Navy and at once started in to
get revenue, on his old tormentor. He
ordered a monster gong to be placed in
Ramsay's office with a push button on his
desk to connect with it, and Soley had fre
quent occasion to summon Ramsay up one
flight at stairs to the Assistant Secre
tary's office. It was a loud sounding
gong ringing out with a volume and sud
denness that would startle every occu
pant on the lower floor. Its primary ob
ject was well understood and no one
sympathized with Ramsay for the hu
miliation to which he was subjected dur
ing two long years: .
The outlook for additional ships during
the next session of Congress is not very
promising. /The United States Shipbuild
ing Trust is practically out. for some In
definite period as a bidder on navy work,
leaving only five private j shipyards . at
which battleship building can be carried
on. Of these latter yards the Newport
News has already four battleships and
three armored cruisers under " construc
tion, the Cramps' yards three armored
cruisers, the New York Shipbuilding Com
pany at Camden one battleship and one
armored/ cruiser: Fore River has three
battleships, and Moran Brothers, Seattle,
one battleship. The two last named yards
are taxed, to their full limit with the
work now on hand, leaving only three
yards as competitors for the three 13,000
ton battleships to be contracted tor with
in six months..
The system of paying premiums for ex
cess of speed was discontinued in our
navy, about seven years, ago, and since
then the contractors have been content to
come up to the requirements and making
no special efforts to make records. The
handsome bonus of $175,000 earned by the
Oregon, against $38,500 for the Indiana and
$100,000 for the Massachusetts was earned
through superior design and workmanship
in details of machinery, and chiefly
through the adoption of propellers suit
able for the vessel. The propellers of the
three ships varied in their slip, being
24.85 per cent for the Indiana against 22.64
on the Massachusetts and only. 14.33 per
cent for the Oregon. The incentive to
earn a premium resulted in getting better
ships for the Government than the con
tracts stipulated, but in the case of the
four monitors recently completed it is
rather disappointing to note that the Wy
oming, built by the Union Iron Works,
makes the poorest showing. The vessels
were to make a speed of 11.5 knots on 2400
horsepower, and the trial speed data show
that the Nevada' made 13.039 knots, her
strews having a slip of only 9.57 per cent;
the Arkansas, 12.713 knots and 9-44 per cent
slip; the Florida, 12.4 knots and 24.45 per
cent slip, while the Wyoming made only
11.8 knots, owing to the excessive slip of
her propellers, which averaged 30.07 per
cent. It is safe to assume that Jf a pre
mium of $5000 for each quarter knot excess
over contract had been offered the Wy
oming Would have turned out faster than
any of jfce other monitors, while now she
I* the lowest of her class and detracts
from the*former splendid record of the
Union Iron Works. Similar disappoint
ments may be looked for in the protected
cruisers' approaching completion as well
as in the battleships and armored cruisers
under construction.
The British torpedo-boat destroyer Sy
ren established a record last month for
getting up steam. The boat was lying at
Portsmouth with a fleet of other
destro'yers ' under cold boilers Â¦ when
the admiral signaled "Raise steam
for fifteen knots with all dis
patch." In fifty-eight, minutes the
Syren had steam for speed required, and
the next best vessel did not signal
"ready" until twenty-five minutes after
the Syren was far off on her course. The
Syren is fitted with water-tube boilers of
the Reed type.
The accident on board the armored
cruiser Good Hope two weeks ago, by
which seven men were scalded in the
boiler-roomâ three of whom have since
diedâis believed to have been caused by
heavy gun firing. The concussion Is said
to have broken one of the anchor bolts of
one of the elements In the Belleville boil
ers, lifting it from Its cone and causing a
rush* of heated water under a pressure of
300 pounds into the fireroom. .
When Laughlin arrived all of the In
dtans,had gathered to receive him. They
hail 'appointed several of their number to
receive the officials of the Government
and to present them to the tribe. It was
agreed to give each Indian who is the
head of a family twenty acres of land
and $200 in cash. The land is to be held in
trust for a period of twenty-five years,
and at the end of that time Is to be deed
ed to the holder, with the understanding
that it is to be held ln severalty. The
money is to be paid at once. The Indians
accepted the proposition after a short
conference, and the surveys will com
mence within the next few days.
Reports from EIko County say that
Piute Indians are dying in large numbers
ln the vicinity of the Duck Valley res
ervation. The exact nature of the disease
is not stated, but It is understood to be
some sort of fever.
DAYTON, Nev., July 5.â The passing of
the famous Piute tribe of Indians is
realized more clearly in the recent action
of the Government is opening a greater
portion of their reservation to the public.
When the allotments were made and com
pensation was awarded it was found that
of this once powerful tribe but 100 .fami
lies remain, and a number of these are
dying off from an epidemic In the neigh
borhood of the Duck Valley reservation.
Major Laugblin, inspector of Indian res
ervations, arrived here two days ago for
the purpose of completing an arrange
ment with the Indians for the disposition
of their lands. The reservation is an ex
tremely large one, and a portion of it is
mineral land of a high quality. Owing
to the fact that it has beentreserved for
the use of the tribe miners have been
barred and prospecting or development haa
never gained headway. As soon as it is
thrown open to settlement a boom is ex
pected in the section and hundreds of peo
ple are waiting to take up property. The
opening of the country will throw all of
the mineral land out of the red man's
district. Rich timber land will also be
sold and this section of the State will
be greatly benefited.' A small portion of
the reservation will be reserved for its
original owners. This portion will be
nothing more than grazing and farming
land.
Special Dispatch to The Call
TUCSON, Ariz.. July 5.-At the direct
request of the State Department the
United States District Attorney of Ari
zona has just completed an nvesfation
into what was reported to the Mexican
Government as a plan for an armed force
to invade the State of SÂ° n t ora â¢ * Â£ '" bu Â»:
tering expedition, there to establish an
fSndeni state. with *â¢ *^Â£^
pose of annexing it to the Ln ted States
The request for such an investigation
came through the Mexican Embassador
and was at once referred to % Attorney
General's department and by Wm to the
Federal authorities of the Territorj.
ISenTx was specified as the headquarters
of the alleged revolutionists, and there
and elsewhere the government officials
made a thorough investigation.
What they discovered to bo the cau?-Â»
of all this trouble was that a few months
ago P. K. HIclcey. a well-known business
man. was conversing with friends on the
subject of the treatment of American
railroad men in Sonora. With some
warmth he averred that "some day we
will simply have to go down there and
annex the country to the United States.
Â«e went no further with his remarks;
Indeed, he forgot he had ever said any
thing 1 on the subject. But the words werÂ«
picked up by a passing Mexican, who told
the Mexican Consul, who passed the in
formation along through official channels.
Special DUpatch to The Call
Out of the recent forest fires in â¢ New England
there has come an .extensive- discussion concerning
the best means of preventing any future occurrence
of the kind. : It is safe to say, however, the talk will
pass the summer season, and, when winter comes,
with its snows and its Legislatures, there will be a
complete forgetfulnes"s . of any such -thing as forest
preservation.
In thi? city, therefore, Mr. Mackay will find a cor
dial and sanguine response to his wish that the cable
may prove a useful factor in the commerce of the
United States. We shall work for the realization, of
that wish, and date a new era in our local history
from the completion of this great work of a pioneer
and a native son.
In addition to this feeling of pride we have a deep
interest in the cable by reason of the advantages it
will furnish us in our expanding trade with the East.
All experience proves that the flow of commerce is
westward. Hitherto our trade has gone backward,
as it -.vere. We have looked eastward to the Atlantic
States for our markets rather than westward across
the great ocean of which San Francisco is the natural
metropolis; The daily messages which the cable will
bring us from Manila and the populous lands of
eastern Asia will tend to turn our eyes in that direc
tion, and we shall then seek in those countries a
larger market than the Atlantic States can give. It
may. of course, take years of time to achieve such
markets and to adapt our industries to the needs of
those people, but in the end we shall succeed, and
San Francisco will take rank among the greatest
commercial centers of the globe.
The completion of the cable corresponds with the
coming of a critical moment in the history of the
East and of the world. It can no longer be ques
tioned that Russia is aiming at something like a
monopoly of the markets of Manchuria and of
northern China, and it is a foregone conclusion that
should that monopoly be established it would not be
very long before the force of circumstances would
impel the Russians to even further aggressions upon
the Chinese empire. It is, therefore, altogether for
tunate that at this juncture the United States has ob
tained a means for prompt communication with the
Orient over a wire under American control, for we
are thus put in a position to keep posted on the
progress of events, and to learn promptly whatever
may happen.
To Californians the completion of the cable is more
interesting than to any other people, for it is not
only closely related to our commercial interest?, but
it is due to the enterprise of a California pioneer
nnd the energy of a native son. Every people is
naturally and justly proud of the achievements of
their fellow countrymen. That is one of the instinc
tive feelings of the human heart. It iÂ« associated
with patriotism, and nations erect monuments, to
their great men, not only because of the honor due
to their work, but because of the glory reflected
upon the nation itself. In California we have felt a
high degree of pride in the record made by the men
who founded the commonwealth. We have delighted
in citing their works as an evidence that the men
who came to this coast to build up a new State in the
American Union represented the best elements of. the
manhood oi the time. The Pacific cable will be an
other proof of the vigor and* the sagacity of the
pioneers, and therefore the completion of the cable
is something in the nature of a Californian triumph
in the world of industry and commerce.
BY the message sent from President Roosevelt
to Clarence H. Mackay on July 4 evidence was
given that human energy has at last girdled
the globe with wires affording means for telegraphic
communication round the world. The President's
message made the circuit in twelve minutes. That
speed, which in a former age would have seemed 'like'
magic, will hardly affect the popular mind of to-day.
Indeed some may wonder why the speed is not
greater. We have become accustomed to the achieve
ments of electricity by means of wire, and "now we
have special wonder only for wireless messages and
for the marvels that are being wrought through the
mysterious forces of radium.
Despite the lack of popular wonder, however, the
completion of the Pacific cable is a great step for
ward in the advancement of civilization. The work
is more important than it seems to us, and carries
with it wonderful possibilities. It places us in close
relations to the far oft Orient and opens opportuni
ties of trade that can hardly be even so much as
estimated at this time. That feature of the work was
uppermost in the mind of Clarence Mackay in the
hour of his triumph, and his message in reply to
President Roosevelt was an expression of an earnest
hope that "the Pacific cable, by opening the wide
horizon of the great East, may prove a useful factor
to the commerce of the United States."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 6, 1903.
The hymn "America" is at last to be dressed up in
a new tune. A -New York professor has been given
a "gcld/medal by the Society â¢ of the. Cincinnati for
writing : an acceptable melody. ; The old-fashioned
one,, even though made from imported .goods, has
done trood service and will not be cast. aside without
a tinge of regret. "
The young lady telephone operators at Spokane
have struck in a body,. and one of their demands is
that they-be. accorded the privilege of dressing to
suit themselves. The. outcome will be noted with
interest, 'as woman has been absolute ruler of her
paraphernalia from time immemorial and has guarded
that right jealously.
The Consul at Kehl, Germany,^ reports to his Gov
ernment after a visit to this State that California
prunes and apricots are rapidly supplanting those of
France and Italy.-and that the outlook for v their in
creased sale in Germany is most encouraging. He
reports the California fruit to be better- and cheaper,
and says the only" objection thereto is in the kind of
boxes- used and the delay in transit. This might be
worth investigating by our commercial bodies/
There is a proposition being, considered by the
State .Lunacy Commission to make all supplies for
the State hospitals by the inmates of those institu
tions.-/ While the State hospital is of course a neces
sary-institution, any effort ; toward making the same
self-supporting will be eagerly' welcomed by the tax
payers. The making of supplies to be consumed en
tirely by the makers thereof cannot be regarded as
conflicting in any way with outside labor.
Here's a pretty state of things. Here's a pretty
howdyedo. Any law in restraint of matrimony, is as
much against public policy as a merger in restraint,
of trade. Matrimony indeed is" the suprerife merger.
Without it society could hardly get along. Iy'is a
trust that even divorce courts never bust "without re
gret and lawyers never undertake to dissolve without
charging heavy fees. If the Sherman act itand in
the way of this long established merger and trust it
is high time to begin to think out remedies. Â¦"
Our schools, colleges and universities Jiave just
graduated a large number of young, men' and young
women. The youthful and ardent host* will havt
nothing to do during the summer except look for
mates. In times past the search has been free from
all business complications. No'ryoung, man has had
to begin his suit by asking the summer girl of his
choice whether or no she owns railway stock.
Neither has any girl, ( when asked to answer yea or
nay, been compelled to ask foretime in which to*
consult a lawyer as-tothe legality of the proposed
merger of property. .The result is that the. American
youth is up against a difficulty of 'a new. kind and
has an undoubted right to kick.
â¢ Perhaps the law authority of the Sun is wrong.
Perhaps the Supreme Court, if the issue ever comes
up, will find a means of so the Sherman
act as to,permit a man who owns stock in a railway
to marry a real nicegirl who owns, stock in a com
peting line. Until that construction has been given,
however, it will be well for young men . and women
to -be. careful. Perhaps the safest â¢way, will be Jor.

It Is the rarest thing in the world for
a man to be. necessarily bald. No man
whose hair is not dead at the roots need
be bald if he will use Newbro's Herpi-
cide, the new scalp antiseptic. Herpi-
cide destroys the germ that cuts the hair
off at the root, and cleans the scalp of
dandruff and leaves it In a perfectly
healthy condition. Mr. Mannett, in the
Maryland block. Butte, Mont., was en-
tirely bald. In less than a month Herpi-
cide had removed the enemies of hair
growth, and nature did its work by cov-
ering his head with thick hair an inch
long and ln six weeks he had a normal
suit of hair. Sold Â¦ by leading druggists.

It was learned from another source that
Abbott cabled to England for money yes
terday afternoon, but whera he raised the
necessary funds with which to "meet his
irregularly incurred debts no one but his
friend geemcd'ablc to explain and the
latter wouldn't. In the , afternoon -the

"A night or so after he arrived here Ab

freely of wine. Since then he has been
going the route at a maddening pace. Apr
parently he became impressed with the
idea that he had money enough to choke

like a crazy king. This morning when he
awoke and was iianded a paper containing
the details of his misdoings he concluded
that he had had enough notoriety, for at

i On the train going tast he was devotion

Kages to all his acquaintance*, a?kinK them to
call en me, and in each case thc-y responded,
and we were the recipients of many Rtten

fected and unlmpassioned manner, say
i ingr:
I hardly know exactly what to think about
Mr. McCue. From the moment we were mar
ried until I lert him in the hospital at Fort
Sheridan he was certainly everything a hus
band should be. While we were Ftaying ht-re
at the Palace Hotel v.-e sent out announce

among others he requested me to addrers one
to IILes Ida Weptcott. in Cincinnati, who, he

â¢'Vookp. who does not know whether she is
. a.Tj-ife or not. Bpir.g introduced to Lieu

Occifloaial Hotel, after a week's acqualnt-

: once a hasty marriage was decided on,
. ajd on June 32 they were married by
Judge Lawron at the bride's home, .with
o ifti? full sanction and consent of her fam
, ily. Four days were spent at the Palace
' Hotel prior to their departure for Chi
cago, where the youthful bride's honey
moon was cut short by the astounding
announcement that the husband had been
m'arried previously and had another wife
â¢ living.
Sirs. McCue No. 2, who is only JuÂ«t 18
years old, Js a most attractive and charm
ing girl, and looks even younger than she
fs. Possessing as she does a delightful per
sonality, accompanied by a great charm
i,pt nfanner, it Is quite easy to see how the
youryj lieutenant fell In. love with her.
Y*?Â£terday afternoon, surrounded by all
the members of 'her family, she told the
â¢ strange story in a quiet, simple, unaf-
The numerous sufferers from Injuries
sustained through fireworks and the reck
less use of firearms on July 4 were In
most Instances progressing favorably yes
terday. The Injuries In each case were
painful, however, and in some instances
it will be many days before the wounded
are convalescent.
Gustave Kuhne, who was seriously In
jured while trying to load his revolver
at his residence, 145 Natoma street, is still
lying at the German Hospital in a serious
condition. The surgeons have tried to
find the bullet, which entered his abdo
men, but without avail.
The dangerous use of revolvers on the
public Btreets on the Fourth was more in
practice than on any former, occasion, and
while a number of the lawbreakers were
arrested there were many more who dis
charged firearms without molestation. In
one instance two bullets were . fired
through the plate glass door of Sullivan's
shoe store, in the Pioneer building. An
ugly looking spent bullet was picked up
yesterday morning on O'Farrell street,
near Franklin, in which vicinity a good
deal of the pistol firing was indulged In.
LAWBREAKERS ARRESTED.
There were fifteen arrests for discharg
ing firearms within the city limits, seven
for malicious mischief, six for disturbing
the peace, two for building bonfires with
out a permit and one for carrying a con
cealed weapon. _.f
Besides the victims of fireworks and
pistol' accidents treafed on Saturday, the
Emergency Hospital and the City and
County Hospital surgeons had a few
cases to attend to yesterday, the sufferers
being boys who had been anxious to con
tinue the celebration one more day.
Frank Meehan, aged 11 years, residing
at 10'VicIisburg street, was badly burned
about the hands and face in trying to
send a roman candle" skyward. He was
treated by Dr. McElroy at the City and
County Hospital. ,
William Ilaack, aged 9 years, got his
left hand burned by the discharge of a
toy pistol, the wad of which lodged in
the palm. He paid no attention to tho
wound until yesterday, when it com
menced to give him trouble. An examlna.
tion of the wound convinced Dr. McElroy
that blood poisoning might set in, and
possibly lockjaw, consequently William
was placed in a ward in the City and
County Hospital for observation and
treatment.
MAY LOSE HIS SIGHT.
Oscar Herbst, aged 9 years, was treated
at the same hospital for serious burns
on the face and hands, both his eyes be
ing injured. The unfortunate boy Is In
dnager of losing his sight.
Harry Rice had some burned powder re
moved from his left hand at the Park
Emergency Hospital by Dr. Armisted.
Rice is a visitor from Sacramento, and
while experimenting at the corner ot
Buchanan and Fell streets he sent the
contents of a bulletless cartridge through
the palm of his left hand.
Charles Nelson received treatment at
the same hospital for a slight burn on the
left hand produced by the discharge of a
toy pistol.
Anticipating from past experience a full
crop of accidents on the Fourth, Chief
Surgeon Edwin Bunnell of the Central
Emergency Hospital pressed an extra
ambulance into service, together with two
extra surgeons' and two extra hospital
stewards. Though the number of injured
did not quite equal those of last year,
nevertheless Dr. Bunnell found his aug
mented surgical staff just able, with the
regular medical attendants, to treat all
the cases brought to the hospital.
WEARY OF WEARING
GOOD CLOTHES
"When Dr. II. J. Davenport, professor of
political economy in the "Univorsity j of
Chicago, makes the statement that people
do not wear beautiful clothes because
they are beautiful or artistic, but simply
for the sake of making ostentatious dis
play, he Is, of course, talking nonsense.
The professor did not stop at condemna
tion of the people who wear beautiful
clothes, but went on to denounce those
who ride in highly colored automobiles,
the Salvation Army on account of its
uniform and everything in. the nature of
what he calls display.
The average citizen knows enough to
discriminate between those who seek dis
play for the sake of display and those
who have a real liking or love for every
thing that is graceful, tasteful and artis
tic. The arerage citizen knows well how
to differentiate between the gentleman
and the dandy, the lady and the snob, the
refined and the vulgar. And the average
citizen is not at a loss to distinguish at
a glance the college professor who talks
for the sake of calling attention to him
self from the college professor who talks
because he has something to say.
A love for the beautiful is Inherent in
mankind and womankind. The vast ma
jority of people are fond of beautiful
things and like to be surrounded with
beautiful things, whether they number
beautiful things among their possessions
or not. It would be as reasonable to say
that people keep themselves clear and
neat for the sake of making ostentatious
display as to say that they dress in the
be?t they can command for that reason.
. That there is, always has been and al
ways will be vanity in this world nobody
will deny, but it is far from being the
truth that people In general wear nice
clothes, buy handsome furniture or sur
round themselves with beautiful and ar
tistic things from sheer vanity. Professor
Davenport forgets that there is such~a
thing as the esthetic sense and that in
proportion as it Is developed In men and
women do we find them to be advanced
in all the ideals that make for the highest
intelligence and! culture. . . . ;
The sword and belt referred to by the
young woman are of the finest design,
and on the hilt of the weapon is engraved,
"Presented to First Lieutenant William
K. McCue, First Infantry, by the men of
Company M, First Infantry, In remem-
From hearsay I believe Miss We6tcott thinks
he is crazy, and I understand that she said
she wished him placed in an asylum. If he is
married to her I am sure ha has forgotten It
and that that portion of his life is a Jrtank.
Lieutenant Beecher tcld mo that Miss West
cott had grone to Cuba with Mr. McCue and
that he had understood they were married, but
that he could not vouch for the truth of the
statement. When Mr. McCue was in Manila
he was struck two heavy blows on the head
with a bolo and was very ill with typhoid
fever. Possibly . this may account for his ac
tions. His brain is undoubtedly affected, nnd
if he is not insane now he ia very near it.
As I left the room he called out, "Believe
in me, little one. You are my wife and I have
no other."
THINKS McCTJE DEMENTED.
When my father wired me to come home I
went out to Fort Sheridan, where I was most
kindly treated by Colonel McCaj=key, the com
mander of the post. I was escorted to the
hospital by the colonel and four sentries stood
Kuard near by, as they were afraid Mr. Mc-
Cue might become viclont and try to harm me.
On the contrary, he was gentleness Itself, and
when I told him I was going back to San
Francisco he burst into tears and entreated
me to stay. He was very weak and sick, but
kept reiterating that he had never been mar
ried to Miss Westeott. and said, referring to
her. that "Hell hath no fury like a woman
scorned." lie gave me all his pay accounts and
pressnted me with a beautiful sword and belt
which were civen to him by the men in his
company while he was in the Philippines..
When Mr. McCue returned anfl did not fln<]
me he was almost beside himself with excite
ment and went to every hotel in the city look
ing for me. In the meantime General Chaffee
had been advised 'of affairs and he had Mc-
Cue arrested and taken out to Fort Sheridan,
where he became very ill and was confined to
his bed.
ceremony had been performed in St. Paul's
Church, and this was followed by another tele
gram purporting to come from the priest who
had solemnized the wedding. When this last
telegram came Mr. McCue was out with tome
friends, and I at once communicated by In
formation to the proprietor of the hotel, who
placed mo in the charge of a Miss Bennett, who
was residing there.

Motley in Search of Talent.
With a strong hare to follow in the de
ciding course Flora Belle easily outpointed
Mount Rose and annexed the stake.
Golden Rule fooled the talent by taking
the flag from Semp'ronius, a 1 to 4 favor
ite. Royal Friend looked to have a good
chance to contend for top honors, but fell
a victim to hard coursing.
Judge Creamer's campaigner Lily

In her first trial Flora Belle romped
away from the once champion Wedge
wood and ended the trial without allowing
him a point. Then against Glaucus, Tlllie
R, Reno and Belfast she repeated the per
formance and reached the final with a
clean score.
J. Regan's clever greyhound Flora Belle
won first honors in the classified event
yesterday at Ingleside Coursing Park in
a manner that proved her a courser of
the right sort.
The directors of the Golden Gate Tennis
Club will appoint a committee Thursday
night to wait upon the Park Commission
ers for the purpose of inducing them to
lay out more asphalt courts. The Idea is
to have the courts on the raised ground
in front of the clubhouse of bitumen.
This is an ideal spot for exhibition courts
and could be used as well for practice.
Commissioner Lloyd, who does so much
for the park, players, favors the plan and
there is little doubt but it will, be
carried out.
TJÂ»e drawing; for the handicap doubles
tournament to be played on the park
courts Sunday will be held Thursday
night,-when the entry list will close.
The most interesting singles match was
that between George Janes and E. P. Fin
negan. Janes was a trifle too strong for
his opponent and took two close sets. The
following matches were played:
' Charles Dunlap and George. Baker beat C.
Foley and S. C. Gayness, 10-8, 7-5; J. R. Wll
gus beat W. A. Wilgus, 0-2; Mr. and Mrs. J.

Twiggs, 6-2/ 4-0. 11-9; Teller and Guerin tied
Baker and Routh, 6-3, 4-6; Janes beat Finne
gnn, C-4, 7-5. . <
A fast and exciting doubles was played
on the public courts. The opposing teams
were: Charles Dunlap and George Baker
and C. Foley and Stewart Gayness. The
former team, although considered much
stronger than its opponents, had great
difficulty in winning. The score was 10-8,
7-5.
Another high class match was that in
which Harry Routh and Charles Dunlap
took the measure of Clarence Griffin and
George Janes, the pony team. Young
Griffin is making rapid strides and if he
continues to improve will shortly go into
the first class.
Most of the crack tennis players who
participated in the championship tourna
ment at San Rafael rested yesterday after
the strenuous week's work. The park
courts were as much in demand as usual,
but affairs were not lively on the Califor
nia courts.

CHICAGO, July 5. â Chicago gave the crip

playing and numerous errors. The, game was
stopped several times to allow Injured players
to recover. Brcsnahan was called into the
game from the grand stand and Chicago pro
tested, but the same was allowed to proceed
in order not to disappoint the big crowd. ThÂ«
protest was made under rule 27. section 1,
which requires all players, including substi
tutes who are to take part In the game to be
on the field In uniform at the beginning of the
game.
The condition of the protest is said to be
unique in the history of national championship
playing. Hart of the Chicago management
said the game probably will be ordered to be
played over again rather than allow It to be
given to Chicago. Attendance, 12,000. Score:

"three" at the seventh hole won the
trophy. Miss Chesebrough spelled her
chance for a victory at the elehth hole
in the second round. She required eleven
strokes before she could go on to the last
part of the course.
As Miss Whittell is a member of the
Burlingame Club the trophy will remain
In the possession of that organization
until such time as Miss Whittell wins it
again, making it her property, or the

RUN'S AND HITS BY INNINGS
Two fast double plays kept runs from
scoring on both sides. In the third, when
the Cripple? had the bags full and but
one out. Brashear hit one squarely over
the second bag. It looked like a hit, but
Shay was after It In a twinkling and,
touching the bat, he threw the ball to
first and completed a double play, sav
ing at least two runs.
San Francisco also had the bags all oc
cupied in the fifth, when Kelly hit a liner
right at Baxter. The lloose held the ball
and touched second, making a neat
double and saving his team from a worse
defeat. The score:

Pabst started proceedings with a hit to
the right garden, and Lynch beat out a
bunt. Krugr set the crowd going with a
hit past second, which brought Pabst
around. Lynch landed on second, where
old Peter caught him napping off the bag.
Then Dclmas walked, and Cooper made a
throw to the bag to catch him napping.
Brashear let the ball go past him and
both runners advanced a base.
Kelly hit the ball to second and while
he was being put out Krug crossed' the
pan. After this Ham Ibergr laid one down
to Reilly. The chance was easy", but
Reilly threw the ball about ten feet over
Brashear's head and Delmas came over
with the third tally.
Oakland got its only run in the fourth,
when Murdock was safe on an error by
Irwin. He went around to third on a
Texas Leaguer to right by Baxter and
completed the trip of the bases on Kru
ger'n out.
In a few minutes he returned again and
Bat down on the Oakland bench, but wide
ly refrained from 'making any more com
ment*, as he saw Jack was In earnest and
would not stand for any more of h!s loud
talk from the bench. The spectators all
peemed to approve of O'Connell's action.
They cheered the umpire when he ordered
the noisy magnate back to the shed.
Both Cooper and Iberg pitched pplendid
ball all through the game. There was lit
tle to choose between the work of the
two m*-n. Cooper was unfortunate In the
second round, when the three runs ' were
made, but he kept right on pitching and
had Uncle's bunch blanked after that pe
riod.
The afternoon game should really have
been captured by the Cripples, but they
made two errors in the second round, and
then in the ninth they another
chance when Kruger tried to stretch a
nice double into a triple sacker when no
one was down. Right after this occur
rence Irwin committed' an error that
would have put ar.other run over, but
there wat no one on the bags to take ad
vantage of the play.
Cal Ewing, thcOakland magnate, played
sn important part in the struggle in the
fourth inning, when he became too out
spoken, and Umpire Jack O'Connell
promptly ordered him off the field. Ewing
dodged back Into the clubhoufe when the
special officer came to take him away,
but finally came out and went off the
field.
The series ended evenly for the two
team.*, each taking four games. By the
way it started last Tuesday it appeared
the Cripple? would take about peven, but
their steam seemed to die away toward
the end of the week, and Uncle's tribe
fraved themselves with a strong finish In
the last games of the series.
The Cripples seemed to lose their win
ning grip yesterdaf arid they succumbed
twice to the home team. In the morning
over on the Oakland baseball Held they
went down 8 to 5. At Recreation Park In
the afternoon thÂ«*y were on the short end
throughout the battle and faded away.

BLTLEMEN WILL ENTERTAIN.
Team Which Won the Centennial Ex
hibition Championship to
Celebrate.
This is the twenty-seventh anniversary
of the victory of the California Schuetzen
Club rifle team over riflemen from all over
the world. The members of the club pro
pose celebrating properly in commemora
tion of the event.
When the Centennial Exposition was
held In ISTo at Philadelphia, and the rifle
shots of the world were invited to test
their skill, Phllo Jacoby gathered about
him six members of the California
Schnetzen Club to represent this State in
the contest. These six members were A.
Strecker, A. Rahwyler, William Koenlg.
William Streuly, William Ehrenpfort and
A. Bauer. These men paid their own ex
penses, went to Philadelphia and defeated
all comers, bringing back to California
the world's championship and a handsome
trophy, which they still retain.
In speaking of the affair yesterday,
Philo Jacoby said: "The emblem of our
California Schutezen Club is the bear flag
of this State, and when we went to Phila
delphia in 1S76 it was the first time the
East ever saw It. We captured tho cham
pionship, defeating the next best team,
the Helvetia of Switzerland, by sixty
elght rings. William Hayes, at that time
shooting king of the Bundest. took third
prize with his team from Newark, N. J.
"Mr. Hayes was here last year and lost
his crown to A. Strecker. the present
bundest kins, and a member of the team
which took the championship at the Cen
tennial Exposition contests." Mr. Jacoby
neglected to state that he made the high
est score.
There are but four members of the orig
inal team in this city. They are Jacoby,
Strecker, Rahwyler and Ehrenpfort.
Bauer is long since dead and Komi? is a
resident of Hanover, Germany. Nothing is
known of Streuly.
Each year since 1S76 it has been the
custom of these men to meet on July 6th
and celebrate the anniversary of their
great victory. They will entertain their
friends at a banquet. The affair will take
place to-night at 9 o'clock at the Odeon.

fielding. Burns at second was a feature of
the game, he having a total of seventeen

The Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson ob
served the thirty-fifth anniversary of his
entry into the ministry by addressing his
congregation at Trinity Methodist Episco
pal Church last night, his subject being
"Then and Now."
Dr. Wilson said that those who think
the world Is getting worse have studied
and compared past times with the pres
ent to very little purpose.
In 1803, the doctor said, there was in
this country but one church member to
every fifteen of the inhabitants, while in
1903 there was one in every five. Thirty
five years , ago, he said, the Methodist
church numbered but 1,250,000. It had to
day over 6,000,000 communicants and 24,
000,000 adherents. Dr. Wilson said that
the property of the Methodist church was
worth 5187,000,000. Thirty- five years ago,
he said, it gave less than $1,000,000 a year
to. all benevolent purposes and at this
time it gives more than $3,000, 000 annually.

Mary Gonzales, the young woman who
was so terribly burned through the ex
plosion of a email oil stove at 9 Hlnckley
alley early yesterday morning, died at the
Harbor Emergency Hospital a few hours
later and her body was taken to the
Morgue. She died from shock caused by
the burns. She came from Stockton about
a month ago and was 26 years of age.
Death Ends Her Suffering.
Two horses and a cow and several vehi
cles were taken from the burning barn,
but some machinery and several thou
sand feet of cedar lumber and some doors,
window Fashes and other building mate
rial, which were in the loft, were con
sumed with the barn.
On Saturday* night the grass on the lot
was set aflre several times by fireworks,
but on each occasion it was put out by
Reuben and his brother Herbert. The
damage is estimated at 11000.
The flre department succeeded in con
fining the fire to the place of its origin
and prevented its spreading to the stacks
of timber on the lot.
A fire which threatened the residence,
horses and a cow belonging to F. W.
Kern, builder and contractor, 2449 Seven
teenth street, destroyed a barn in the rear
of Mr. Kern's house, corner of Seven
teenth street and Potrero avenue, at 1:30
o'clock yesterday afternoon. Kern was
away with some members of his family,
the only one remaining at home being a
young son, Reuben. The lad was playing
with another boy near the barn and was
surprised to see flames shoot from the
roof. He sent in an alarm, and before
the engines arrived the flames looked so
threatening that a second alarm was sent
in.

"No, we haven't made any arrests yet."
the great detective told tho reporter.
"You can say this much, however: We
know who the murderer is.
"He is one of four men whom we
have been watching from the first. The
fact that only ono man committed the
crime has been sworn to by witnesses.
"Neither the first nor second of these
four men was present when the shot was
fired. The third man was also away at
the time.
"The fourth man is the one we want,
and we can lay our hands on him when
ever we're good and ready."
"Then what are you waiting for?" asked
the reporter. "Why don't you arrest him
now?"
"Well, said the great detective, "you
see we're not yet sure as to the proper
numbering of these men. We know that
the fourth man is the one we want, but
which of these four is the fourth man?
That's what we're working on now."â

DENVER, July 5.â Christian Endeavor
hosts have already begun to assemble in
this citv and from now on . until next
Thursday, when the international biennial
convention Is to open, large delegations
from all parts of the country will arrive
daily. Nearly 2000 Denver people have
been working for weeks to insure the suc
cess of the coming convention, and plans
have been made to care for 25,000 visitors,
though, hardly a.o many are expected to
come. Fifteen acres of ground near the
City Park have been set aside as a con
vention cajnp. The general meetings -will
be held in a large tent, christened Tent
Endeavor, which will give seating room
for 10.000 people. The big tent is surround
ed by smaller tents and the entire grounds
will be brilliantly lighted with electricity.
Seventeen churches In the city will be
thrown open to the Endeavorers as the
State headquarters during the convention.
The opening session will be held Thurs
day afternoon following a meeting of the
trustees, at which officers for the ensuing
two years will be elected. There Is no
doubt that Rev. Dr. Francis E. Clark,
who organized the first United Society of
Christian Endeavor at Portland," Me., on
February 22, 1881, will be re-elected presi
dent and William Shaw treasurer. The
present secretary is Van Ogden Vogt. who
was chosen by the trustees only a few
months ago to succeed John Willis Baer.
President Clark will formally open the
convention and addresses of welcome will
be delivered by Governor James H. Pea
body for the State, Rev. Robert F. Coyle
for -the churches and William E. Sweet,
chairman for the committee of 1903. The
song service will be under the direction
of Professor W. J. Whlteman. On Thurs
day evening President Clark will read his
annual addrcsa after which a platform
reception will be held by the officers, trus
tees and State presidents.
The four days following will be crowded
with religious services, missionary rallies
and addresses on topics of interest to
members of the society by prominent
clergymen and other Christian workers
from all parts of the country.
The official programme gives an honored
place to Chuco Ogawa of Japan, who will
officially represent the Endeavorers of
that kingdom. There was a steady in
crease In Christian Endeavor membership
this year, and there are now more than
62,000 societies, some of which are in In
dia, China, Japan and other remote coun
tries.

Dynamiters Make Bold
Attempt to Blow Up
Building.
COLORADO SPRINGS. Colo., July 5.-
An attempt was made to blow up the
plant of the Colorado Springs Electric
Company at 2 o'clock this morning by
dynamite. One hundred and fifty sticks
of dynamite. weighing seventy-five
pounds, were piled alongside the north
end of the big building and a fuse lighted.
The explosion of one stick distributed the
other sticks around a radius of 200 feet,
saving the building and the lives of seven
teen employes. The glass In all the north
ern windows was broken and fires started,
but they were quickly put out. It is con
sidered miraculous that the entire load
did not explode, as there .was enough
dynamite to have laid the plant in ruins.
General Manager George B. Tripp has
offered $3000 reward for the man or men
who made the attempt. There is no clew,
and he states there is no trouble between
the company and its employes. In addi
tion to furnishing Colorado Springs, Colo
rado City and Manltou with light and
power, the company is furnishing power
to the Standard mill of the United States
Reduction and Refining Company, where
a strike was declared Friday by the "Wet-t

TRY TO WRECK
A POWER PLANT
Monte Rio Is a new summer resort on
the North Shore and is about eight mile*
south of Cazadero. Many pretty homes
have been built there and at Tyrone and
the adjacent country holds some valuable
farming properties. It was reported to
night that a large quantity of timber has
been destroyed.
The officials of the North Shore Rail
road early this evening sent every avail
able man to the scene, and at midnight a
special train with 130 men aboard was
hurried to Monte Rio to aid the force of
flre fighters already on the ground.
SANTA ROSA, July 5.- A forest flre a
mile wide at midnight to-night is coming
over the hills toward Monte Rio and Ty
rone and the residents of those localities
and of the surrounding country are great
ly alarmed for the safety of crops and
homes.
Valuable Timber Is Already De
stroyed and a Special Train
Crowded With Men is Hur
ried to the Scene. >
The machinery and buildings were cov
ered by insurance to the amount of $650,
000 and the stock was insured for about
$600,000. The insurance on the buildings
and machinery will cover the full amount
of the loss on this part of the plant.
â¢ From the hoghouse the flre spread to
the smokehouse, making a fiery furnace
400 feet long and 520 feet wide. The walls
began to fall about 5 o'clock, but before
that the eastern wooden wall had been
gradually dropping away. The center of
interest was directed to the northeast cor
ner of the building, where nearly 100,000
pounds of oleomargarine, In tierces of 4S0
pounds each, were adding fuel to the
ftre. At â¬ o'clock a large part of the
southern wall fell with a crash. Several
violent explosions had been beard just be
fore as oil tanks burst within the build
ing-.
Within a very few minutes the flames
Â»f re in the hog department, and the car
casses of 4S0Q animals were added, to the
flames. It was in this building that Mil
ler is said to have lost his life.
The fire by 3 o'clock had penetrated to
t he oleomargarine department, which was
at the northeast corner of the building.
The beef beds, egg department and other
departments in the eastern end of the
building, known as the beefhouse, were
soon ablaze. The eastern part of the
building was of wood, built to allow of an
extension of the building in that direc
â¢ tion. The eastern wall was soon a mass
of flames. It burned slowly at first, but
by 3:30 o'clock at began to fall apart,
especially at the north end, where the
oleomargarine department was located.
OIL TANKS BTJBST.
Daniel Smalley, foreman of the car de
partment, fell from the sheds on the
north of the building and suffered serious
injury. The fatalities occurred about 5
o'clock. By that time nearly all the
Vullding was on flre. A man with a hose,
said to have been Fire Marshal Miller,
was seen at one of the windows on the
north side, in the hog department. He
walked back into the building, and a few
seconds later those on the outside heard
t urine cries, which lasted perhaps half a
minute. The man did not appear again
and is believed to have been killed.
Two young men who were in the room
and left a few minutes before said that
t wo men failed to escape, but they did not
give the names of the victims.
The origin of the fire is a mystery.
There was no lire in the casing depart
ment in the eastern part of the building,
where the blaze started.
s, nd 1S00 sheep were burned. Nearly 100,000
pound? of oleomargarine was destroyed.
The contents of the smokehouse were
consumed. The entire north building,
measuring 120 by 4'M feet and ranging in
height from five to seven stories, was
putted. It was with the greatest difficulty
ihat the south building was 6aved.
TWO EMPLOYES PERISH.
The fire started shortly after 2 o'clock,
and by 9 o'clock most of the building was
tone. The greatest danger waÂ« at 6
Â«> clock, when part of the north wall fell
s>nd the fierce flames shot toward the
Nelson Morris building. Though the dense
Fmoke was blown against the big build
ing the work of the firemen saved the
Firucture. Many of the firemen were vol
unteers. There were three of the city
< ompanies at the fire.

An Investigation of the affair was made
by Dtectives Freel and Whitaker, who
found nothing to warrant any other the
ory except attempted murder and suicide.
The Coroner's office was notified and
Deputy Coroner Charles Meehan and Mes
sengers Thomas Davis and James Murphy
responded to the call. The body of Kato
was removed to the Morgue, where an in
quest will be held. The physicians at the
Emergency Hospital are of the opinion
that the woman will recover. The gash
was on the right side of her throat and
did not sever any important blood vessel.
According to S. Tatusano, a partner of
the deceased, he was much worried by
business reverses and had often stated
that he would take his own life and when
he did he would take his wife with him.
Kato conducted a store at 504 Dupont
street but had not been very successful.
The absence- of any bloodstains in the
room occupied by Kato and his wife
demonstrates that he undoubtedly called
her out into the narrow hallway where
she would have but little chance to de
fend herself.
From the statements of the Japanese
who reside in the house and the intimates
of the couple, they never quarreled and
seemed to be much devoted to each other.
A peculiar feature of the affair, and one
that will require explanation on the part
of the woman, is the fact that clenched
in the right hand of the dead man was
found more than $4. How this amount
happened to be in his hand at the time
and how he was able to wield the razor
thus burdened, unless he held the instru
ment in his left hand, is inexplicable.
BATTLE IN THE HALL.
Doctors Ito and Yoshlda responded to
the call and upon examination found that
Kato was dead and his wife still alive.
She was conveyed to her room and by
the use of heroic remedies was saved.
After dressing her wounds the physicians
had her conveyed to the Central Emer
gency Hospital in the ambulance.
The hallway where the tragedy oc
curred is at the head of a short flight of
steps that lead from the street door to
the second floor. There was every evi
dence of a terrible struggle. The wound
ed woman and dead man were found ly
ing side by side. The razor with which
the one life was ended and another jeop
ardized was found lying by the side of
Kato."
FIND KATO DEAD.
The tragedy was enacted at 12 Sallna
Place, the dwelling place of the deceased,
during the absence of the other inmates.
About 11 p. m. S. Saito, who resides in
a house immediately adjoining the Kato
home, was startled by screams. Henry
Nagate, a brother-in-law of the dead
man, was also attracted to the scene and
rushed to the apartments occupied by
the couple. Lying on the floor in a" little
hallway at the head of the stairs lay the
suicide and his wife. Faint and sick at
heart he turned precipitately ajid rushed
downstairs to summon assistance.
Despondent over business reverses and
having become imbued with the Idea
that a continuation of the struggle
against adversity would prove futile Ma
sanosuke Kato, a Japanese merchant,
made an attempt to murder his wife last
night by cutting her throat with a razor
and then feeling assured that he had
been successful in taking her life, drew
the blade across his own throat and bled
to death before the arrival of a surgeon.

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
â¢ â¢ â¢
In the piquant phrase of the moment,
Miss Mabel McKlnley, "favorite niece of
the late President McKinley." and many
other things, "made good," more than
good, at the Orpheum last night. The
event of the week's bill is Miss McKin
ley's debut Into vaudeville, the pleasure
of which was reserved for San Francisco.
Back of It is an unwilling papa, Abner
McKinley, who has a $30,000 distaste for
seeing his daughter behind the footlights
âat least the story goes that the young
lady refused so much rather than give up
her cherished ambition, \ There is al^o a
husband. He Is Dr. Baer, a physician of
prominence, and equally opposed to Mrs.
Baer*s appearance in vaudeville. Then
there is a picturesque small affair of a
$1250 a week salary that also adds inter
est. Then Paris has taught her and
Melba praised. But not these things, nor
the honored name she bears, nor yet her
tiny, piteous crutchesâ that seem indeed
but the odd whim of a pretty woman
are responsible for Miss McKinley's suc
cess of yesterday afternoon and evening.
There was, indeed, a warm friendliness
in her greeting, in which her name count
ed much. There was a shock of sympa
thy for the plucky young woman who
walked in, pink, pretty and smiling, on
crutches. But it was for the singer, for
the engaging personality, that the cheers
went up after her performance. Miss Mc-
Kinley has a full, round soprano, culti
vated and flexible. She uses it very clev
erly, and with an engaging vaudeville ac
cent that is very extraordinary consider
ing her limited acquaintance with the
footlights. Her first number waa the
arditl "II Bacio," Its florid passages han
dled with ease and grace.
In another genre was the second song,
the familiar "My Rosary," that was Bung
very tastefully. The third number intro
duced Miss McKinley as a composer, and
set the audience softly stamping to its
catchy measures. "Anona" is Its title,
and it is all about an Indian maid of
Arizona. The audience encored It lustily,
the singer repeating one of the verses and
afterward giving "Annie Laurie" to her
own accompaniment. She was sympa
thetically accompanied by Oscar Luck
stone in the other numbers.
READY TO GREET
CHURCH WORKERS
SAN DIEGO, July 5.â Three thousand
people to-day witnessed what was â¢ the
nearest to a genuine bullfight that this
section of the country has ever seen.
There had been much advertising of the
exhibition and the trains on the National
City and Otay Railroad were crowded.
The bull pen, or plaza del toro. Is built in
the level country to the south of ,Tia
Juana^ proper. The ring is a little more
than 100 feet across and the Beats are ar
ranged in eight tiers.
There were four toreadors and picadors
from the City of Mexico, who have come
to the peninsula to give exhibitions of the (
kind given to-day. Three of them were in
jured in the contest and one of the in
jured, Manuel Rodriguez, a toreador,
came within about a quarter of an nich of
having his life shut off in the ring.
There were seven bulls brought into the
ring, two of which refused to take part in
the game. The others were ready to fight
the minute they were in the ring, and if a
decision was to be rendered it would have
to be in favor of the bulls. Rodriguez was
hooked in the side of the neck and seven
stitches had to be taken to close up the
wound, which missed the jugular by only
a fraction of an inch.
Francisco Cazares was hooked in the
thigh, but escaped with a scratch, though
he lost a portion of- his pink silk tights.
Antonio Gonzales was thrown "down and
injured in the hip and would have been
gored if the others had not come to his
assistance. The bull ring is built to re
main and exhibitions of the kind will be
given once a month.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Although the carnival spirit has held
full sway on the fiesta grounds for eleven
days the police had but little to do there
in. There were very few instances where
the services of an officer were required,
and these were only for minor offenses.
One of the most enterprising and suc
cessful booths at the carnival is the
country store, conducted by the Gentle
men's Charitable' Association of Alameda.
!i ais booth took In $2300, half of which will
be divided among five Alameda charities
after the expenses are deducted. An ex
press wagon load of flour, meal and other
foodstuffs that remained unsold was do
nated to the California Girls' Training
Home in Alameda and hauled there to
day. Amonsr the workers at the country
store who were on duty for eleven days
were President Arthur B. Tarpey, A. P.
Smiley, Bert L. Fisher, John F. Hanson,
Charles L. Metzger, Ludwig Warnke,

Director General Schlueter, President
F. P. McFeely and Secretary D. A. Sin
clair of the Carnival Association worked
incessantly and the fact that the btg un
dertaking resulted In a gratifying success
!a in a great measure due to the energy
anil efficiency of these officials. Outside
of these gentlemen, two others who were
always promoting and creating interest
in the carnival were Daniel J. Hallahan
and Andy Johnstone.
CHARATIES ABE BENEFITED.
Twenty-five thousand people have vis
ited the fiesta grounds since the open
ing night and have enjoyed them
selves in true Mardi Gras style. Com
pared with the carnival and street fair
held last year, which r: but seven days,
the attendance this year fell 7000 behind.
Last night saw the larce?>t crowd of the
week in the pleasure part, the turnstiles
registering 23,000 paid admissions. The
proceeds of last vear's carnival netted
$15,000. The profits of tl.e fair Just termi
nated have not yet been computed for an
nouncement. Director General Max
Schlueter and his staff of assistants were
busy to-day winding up the affairs of
the carnival, but the benefit to the fire
men will carry their labors over a few
days yet.
"We have not yet completed work on
our financial statement." said Mr.
Schlueter this evening, "and therefore
cannot say at this time how the receipts
of this year's carnival compare with those
of the one held last year. We ran seven
days last year and had 132.000 paid ad
missions. This year we ran the fair eleven
days and the paid admissions numbered
125,000. We are satisfied, however, with
the outcome.
FIGTJBES OF THE FAIR.
Director General Schlueter of the car
nival communicated with a number of
those interested with the result that man
ager J. A. Britton of the Oakland Gas,
Light and Heat Company agreed to fur
nish the lights without cost. J. L. Calla
han will furnish the services of his band
without expense. A number of the best
concessions are still In town and can be
prevailed upon to remain for two nights
more, the proceeds to go to the fund.
All of the booths are still intact and
even if some of the exhibits have been
removed the decorations are still there,
and little will be missed. Mayor Olney
was communicated with to-nicht and
gave his consent to keep the streets
closed for two days longer.
Members of Oakland Lodge of Elks and
members of the fire department have al
ready volunteered their services as spell
ers and ticket men. so that there will be
no cost in this direction. It is expected
that there will be a good sum realized
from the two nights' show. The fair will
not be kept open afternoons.
The Oakland Street Fair will be kept
open for two nights more, the entire pro
ceeds to go to the fund for the relief of
the families of Fireman Frank Parker,
who was killed, and extramen A. A.
Sicotte and D. J. Barr, who were injured
during the burning of the Arcata lodging
house.

BOGOTA, July 5.â In the Colombian
Senate vigorous objections to the Hay-
Herran canal treaty have been made, be
cause It does not bear the signature of
President Marroquln.
There have been stormy discussions
over this point. 1 Dr. Luis Carlos Rico,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, delivered a
two hours' address, during which he.de
clared that the treaty should not bear
the President's signature before final ap
proval.
Former President Cairo, In a speech. In
sisted that the Government should defend
the treaty and not leave the responsibil
ity to the Senate, -câ that juncture the
Senate adjourned, but the discussion is
being continued.
A Delegate In the House of Represen
tatives moved that there be preliminary
debates on the treaty question. The mo
tion was defeated by a vote of 33 to 9,
on the ground that no debates were pos
sible until the Senate had transmitted the
treaty to the House.
It is said that four members of the
House canal committee are decidedly in
favor 'of the Hay-Herran treaty, while
three are against the measure and two
are doubtful, one of whom. Is a Govern
ment partisan.
The canal campaign Is now on in earn
est and indications are that the debate
will be protracted and the decision long
delayed.

dier, to the Central police station yester
day morning and accused him before the
police of having stolen his gold-filled
watch, valued at $5. Policeman Dough

Williams said that Hayes deliberately
took his watch out of his pocket, un

It Is reported by the Greeley Republican
that loco weed is unusually abundant on
the prairies this year. lXÂ»co weed" is a
plant which sets animals crazy; and even
tually causes their death If ita use is con
tinued. But the peculiar thing about it
is the manner in which it upsets the pop
ular idea that animals have an unerring
instinct which teaches them to, avoid all
foods which are harmful. When a horse
or cow has once tasted loco it willwander
over the prairies hunting for more of it
and refusing to eat grass or< any, other
food.'; -.When an animal has acquired the
loco habit it quickly becomes emaciated
and often it runs amuck like a man made
crazy by the use of morphine or whisky.
On the prairie the word "locoed" is ap
plied to men who are Intoxicated of who
have lost their minds, and- it has moved
on to the East, where it is doubtful if
many know its origin.â Kansas City Jour

West Oakland. Parker, Slcotte and Barr
carried a line of hose .into an empty store
beneath the Arcata House and fought the
flames whjch raged in the rear of the
building- . .
They had not been at work more than
five minutes when the entire building
caved in, burying the three men beneath
the flaming mass of beams and woodwork.
Firemen, policemen and citizens bravely
dashed to the rescue of the imprisoned
men. Their cries could be hearA- and
streams of water were turned on the spot
from where the cries came. /
When the fire ensines arrived Chief
Nick Ball did all that was possible to
prevent the fire in the Arcata and the
Waldorf from spreading to the adjoining
buildings. A third alarm was sent in
and all the apparatus quickly responded.
The residents ot the Waldorf, 1 hastily
aroused, just had time to flee for their
lives. Men, women and children, clad only
in their night robes, rushed to the street,
and few of them were able to save more
than a jrarment or two.
ed. They hurried back to the scene of
the fire and awakened tne people sleep
ing in the Waldorf, the rear rooms of
which were burning fiercely.
FIRE SPREADS TO WALDORF.
Sicotte and Barr attempted to set back
Into the burnlnsr ruins to save Parker.
"Let me go," thev both cried as kindly
hands held them In restraint. "Frank Is
in there." they both shouted in what was
temporary mania .as they fought desper

held them. Force was . required to pre

These officers had Just reported ; off

alarm of fire for the Arcata House sound-
Andrews dragged the man Into the
street and the flames then made it im
possible for the police officers to again
enter the place.
From the time the alarm was sent' in
from box 06 until the police officers were
driven out by the flames and could not
further carry on the work of rescue, not
more than four minutes elapsed. For
this reason the officers think it poisible
that some people were- unable to make
their escape from the doomed- structure.
While the work of rescuing the inmates
from the Arcata House was being. carried
on Bimilar brave work. was v belngÂ«done in
the Waldorf rooming-house' by Policemen
C. T. Hunley, Mulgrew, Crossman, Hall
and Williams.
Officer Henderson dashed up to the top
floor of the building but he was only
able to proceed to the front rooms, as the
rear portion of the lodging-house was -a
roaring furnace. Henderson was driven
back by the flames and' smoke and he
managed ' to stagger downstairs and into
the street, where he fell half suffocated
by smoke. He managed to inform Officer
Andrews that there was a paralytic lod
ger lying on the floor of a hall-way and
begged his comrade to go back and save
the man. Andrews again entered the
building and found the unconscious lod
ger on the second floor, to which point
Henderson had brought him from the
floor above.
POLICEMEN SAVE LODGERS.
Officer "W. B. Henderson, night jailer
at police headquarters and Officers Lee
Andrews and James H. Smith were in the
station house when the alarm from . box
06 sounded. They dashed from police
headquarters, ran across the park to the
Arcata House and entered the burning
building.
These brave officers risked their lives
in awakening the inmates of the burning
building, for it was being rapidly de
voured by the flames. Officer Smith was
able to go to the second floor and break
open some of the doors and was assisted
by Officer Lee Andrews. These officers
claim that all the persons sleeping on the
second floor made their escape.
Price looked out of the window across
the park and saw that the Arcata was
on fire from top to bottom and he at
once sent in the alarm for box 56, through
the "repeater." The quick Judgment of
Price resulted in the saving of many
lives, as box 56 is worked by a key and it
would have taken -'precious minutes to
reach the box and send in the alarm
from it.
HOUSE A MASS OF FLAMES.
The discovery that the Arcata was on
fire was made by Assistant Electrician
Dan Hopkins of the police alarm system.
Hopkins waÂ« near the City Hall testing
the wires of the alarm system when he
saw smoke and flames pouring from the
Arcata lodging-house. He at once cried
out "fire" and the sound of his voice
reached Frank Price, the man in charge
of the electric batteries of the fire depart
ment, who was in his rooms In the top
floor of fire headquarters.
Hall, was totally destroyed by
fire at #,o'clock this morning. During the
progress of the blaze Fireman Frank
Parker was killed and A. A. Sicotte and
D. J. Barr, extramen of the department,
seriously injured. The Waldorf rooming
house,' located on Telegraph avenue, was
also badly damaged by fire.
Parker and his comrades, were in the
Arcata when It caved In on them, bury
ing them beneath a mass of flaming de
bris and it was only by heroic efforts
that Sicotte and Barr were rescued and
the body of Parker recovered from the
ruins.
Until the ruins are gone over to-mor
row it is impossible to tell whether or
not any unknown lodgers In the Arcata
met death in the flames and smoke. It
is the opinion of police and firemen that
some of those in the building were unable
to make their escape.
At 3:44 this morning an alarm of fire
was turned in from box 51 for a fire in
the brick building formerly used by the
Electric Light and Power Company," lo
cated at Second and Webster streets.
Eighteen mimutes later the Arcata lodg
ing-house was discovered to be in flames
and an alarm was sent in for the second
fire from box 56. Long before the fire
apparatus responded to the secona alarm,
the Arcata was a seething furnace and
the fierce sweep of the flames jumped
across a space of twenty-five feet and set
fire to the Waldorf building in its rear.

Detectives Recover Weapon
and Learn Name of
the Shooter.
Detectives are puzzled ,over an attempt ;
to take the life of Mrs. Lulgi Romani.
wife of a well-known restaurant man,
residing at Ell Montgomery avenue. Three
shots were fired at the 'woman by an Ital
ian, supposed to be Luigia x^ia, from a
building at 23 Jansen street early Satur
day evening. Each shot passed close by
her bead. The police are on the trail of
.the man who, it is supposed, fired the
s*hots.
Rcmar.I is a partner in the restaurant
conducted hy Colombinl & Romani at â¬30
Montgomery street. His wife was seated
at a window In the rear of her residence
en Saturday evening when she was
startled by a crashing of glass and by
the whiz of a bullet near her head. The
first bullet vras followed closely by an
other and the second by a third. Each
leaden missile passed within an inch of
the woman's head and she sat terrified.
â¢ "When the shooting ceased Mrs. Romani
first awakened her children and then gave
the alarm. Patrolmen responded but they
were unable to discover any trace of the
would-be assassin. The only evidence they
Recured was the glass scattered about the
floor 'and the three bullets imbedded in
the wall opposite. A thorough search
was made, but to no avail. The police at
the Central station were then notified and
an investigation was commenced.
Detective Stephen Bunner took charge
of the case yesterday morning. He ques
tioned Mrs. Romani, but she professed ig
norance as to a motive for the attempt to
destroy her life. Bunner finally diseov
Â«Â»red that the shots â¢wore fired from a
building at 23 Jansen street. The would
be assassin had seated himself in a win
dow and, taking deliberate aim. had fired
upon the woman. He used a Springfield
rifle of the latest type, but his shots failed
of tiirir mark and his intended victim's
life was scared.
Bunner worked until an early hour this
morning. He succeeded in locating the
house and the room from which the shoot
ing was done. Afterward he learned that
Lia occupied the room and started out to
take him into custody. The motive at
tributed by the police is revenge. Bunner
recovered the rifle with which the shoot
i.nj* was done and took it to the Central
Police Station last night. He also found
a. lar^e quantity of ammunition.
A number of Italian resorts were
watched by detectives and patrolmen late
last' night in the hope that Lia might
visit some of them. All the officers in the
North Beach district were furnished with
a description of the suspected man and
were given orders to keep a constant look
out for him.

My sister and her husband roomed at the
Arcata House and they had but little means
I feel sure that If my sister and her husbanu
escaped from the place that they would have
come to me at once for help or send me word
of their condition. I am afraid that they were
unable to get out of the place ana that their
bodies will be found in the ruins.
Late this evening two people were re
ported to the police as missing and it is
thought that they lost their, lives in the
Arcata House. â¢
Mrs. Mary Biltz of Lorin stated that
her sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and
Mrs W. J. Winner, had occupied room
twelve in the burned building. This room
was located in the front of the second
story. When seen to-night Mrs. Biltz
said:
The fire department worked 'hard to
prevent the flames from the Arcata House
and the AValdorf House from spreading
and they were aided greatly by police
men and citizens, who worked like beav
ers. Jack Davis, a lineman the tele
phone company, proved himself a hero.
He saved many people who were in the
Waldorf and went right into the burning
building with a Hne of hose.
The Arcata House was completely
gutted, while the rear half of the Waldorf
Is also a mass of ruins, with the excep
tion of the brick walls.
The body of Frank Parker was recov
ered from the ruins of the Arcata House
by Captain of Police W. J. Petersen, Po
lice Sergeant H. E. Green and James Gal
'lagher, superintendent of line work for
the Gas, Light and Heat Company.
Parker was found lying on his back,
pinned down by Ixavy beams. Tart of
his body was but red, but his face was
'not touched by the flames, being protected
by his hrlmet. which had fu'.len across
his forehead. The body was taken to the
Mcrguc.
MAN AND WIFE ARE MISSING.
POLICE AND CITIZENS HELP.
Slcotte is badly burned on the body,
while Barr escaped with bruises and con
tusions of the body. Barr was able to be
out on the street this evening, but Slcotte
will be confined to his bed for some time.
"Why don't you get in there, you cow
ards, and save him?" was the cry of Barr.
"Here he Is. I've got him," shouted
Slcotte, as he jumped to his feet and then
cried and laughed alternately.
The effect of the awful mental strain to
which Sicotte and Barr had been subject
ed finally passed away and the flrcmen
were conveyed to the hospital, where
their injuries were treated. Then they
were v taken to their homes.
tunate comrade. Parker,
It was stated by one of the interested
parties last evening that Burke is un
compromisingly opposed to â¢ the barones3
having anything to do with the manage
ment of Peter Donahue's estate and that
he is also opposed to having Peter
brought over to this country from Rome
and placed under restraint on his ranch.
To strengthen his opposition it is said
that Burke has demanded of the baroness
her proof of Peter's incompetency, and it
being realized that there actually is little
legal proof at hand that the absent cousin
is really needful of a gnardian. it has
been suggested that possibly it might be
a good idea for one of the family to visit
Rome and secure documentary evidence
in support of a petition *t or letters of
guardianship. In fact, an effort is being
made to induce Jomes P. Donahue to go
to Rome and visit his cousin. His an
swer is being awaited by the others in
terested in the welfare of Peter Donahue.
Yesterday the lawyers concluded that it
would be useless for them to take the
case up in the local courts to-day, so it
was agreed that a postponement should
be asked for.
When the petition of the Baroness von
Schroeder for letters of guardianship over
the person and estate of her 'cousin, Peter
James Donahue, is called In the Superior
Court this morning a postponement will
be askedâ possibly an indefinite one. Ef
forts . of the lawyers representing the
baroness and. Richard Burke of Ireland,
who, in the interest of his children, is op
posing her application, to effect a com
promise, have utterly failed during the
week. James P. Donahue of Davenport,
Iowa, a cousin of Peter Donahue, who
came here at the solicitation of the con
tending parties with a view toward set
tling their differences by accepting the
position of guardian of his relative, has
about concluded that he does not care to
undertake the task, and, added to these
perplexities, is another in the shape of a
report that Peter, disputing the allega
tions of -the baroness that he needs a
guardian for his estate, has encaged a
lawyer here to represent him in a pro
test when the petition- for letters is called
for c hearing.
