A GADDAN GIRL
U1TCLE SAJI'S rapidly expand- I

reputation of being the moat
picturesquely cosmopolitan in
the whcle "world. Just look on the
picture on this page. "Who would ever

tribe among whom she enjoys the
proud honor of being a leading belle,
Itself enjoys the distinction of being

The particular virtues of a scrap box
of the wooden sort, with the sides laced;
together and the bottom laced in. is that
it can always be taken apart and cleaned
and that It can never wear out
All Christmas gifts must have the new
art touch. Last year's Christmas pres
ents are way out of date and they wow
at once that they are not all . that they
should be. The nouveau art fad Â¦ has
struck the realm of 8t Nick and the dc
mestio woman with the talented needle
must learn all tha tricks of the nouTeau
art school. Harnessing her needle with
a bright thread she must work birds and
animals and all sorts of strange- flying
things. And over all and through all soif
must put the touches . of Orientalism^ M
the shape of bright colors and their com
binations. Â¦ Â¦Â¦'Â¦ 'Â¦ ' ;â¢.Â¦ ;' â¢.
Any boy could make such a bo* and, if
he is artlstio or has an artlstlo slst-sr. the
box can be decorated with poker work
or with burnt work of any sort. Those.
who have electrlo light can purchase a
pointed instrument and do some very nice
burnt work." ;â¢ -' Â¦'. . Â» ...-."
These four pieces of . pasteboard are.
laced together at the sides so that. when,
laced, they form a perfect box. .The bot-,
torn is glued in by using very heavy
strips of brown paper on the iiÂ»td*. Or
the bottom can be laced In. The outside
is now decorated wiw watercclor .sketches
or a little rough art work in the way of
application of pretty pictures.
But there are more artlstlo scrap boxes
â¢nd these require the assistance of a
capable carpenter. The material is TeJ|
thin wood, which is a beautiful *fcits Kb
color, or it can be dark If you prefer the
deeper woods. Any color will do. Â¦ The
sides, which are about four inches by ten
Inches, are cut out by the carper. tor and
gradually sloped toward the tc>. so that
the scrap box will be wider r.t the tpp
than at the bottom. The carpenter now
bores holes in the wooden . plecÂ«s. And
finally they are laced together with stout
leather strips, which are as tough as
strips can be. They are laced from the
bottom to the top and tied in a stout lit
tle knot The bottom Is done in the same
way. ... :
To make a scrap box you take htavy
pieces of pasteboard about four inches
wide and gradually widening toward the
top. They can be about twelve Inches
tall. Â¦".'':>. 'â¢â¢
The maklne of a scrap box Is ooe of;

Let them be cut about two ya*Â« long
and rather narrow for the length: and
then, with facile needle, let the woman
who is getting ready for Christmas go to
work upon them. -
The new art table covers are sll re
markable for the fact that their baclr- .
ground is almost completely covered with
handiwork. There are all sorts of strange
figures cut out of the goods and applied
to the covers; and there are strange vein- j
ings and stranger stitches used to hold
them in place.
The beauty of this kind of work, from
the standpoint of the worker, is that it
Is not critical work. Any kind of stitches
will do, for there is no chance to study
any one of the designs critically. All aj* .
mixed In with the general scheme, wl-.Vc"h
is that of completely covering the bacls^
ground.
There Is lass of the actual patchwork
done this year than ever before. The
crazy quilt designs have largely gone out,
but bits of silk are placed together to
make new art covers of a different kind.
A very large "block" Is made and pieces
are sowed on the outside until the "block"
has reached the right size. This is the
up-to-date nouveau art cover, or spread,
or chair back.
*1 vÂ» 4.VB you begun to make Christ
| \ mas presents? If not you are s
I . J little late # even now, for the nen
"V/. Christmas gifts take time, if they
do not take money.
There is one thing about a Christmai
present that it has to recommend it. It
is given and received with the sweet spirit
of Christmas Interwoven into It And
this makes up for a multitude of other
things which may be lacking.
If you are going to give a Christmas,
present, modern, yet without price, you
can take and make a nice little bag,
using sllkollne. It will make up nicely
and on the outside you can embroider a
tnonogram and can pepper the bag with
French knots. It is for fancy work. And,
if you bo desire, 3*ou can work the words
'Fancy work" upon the reverse of the
bag.
Your gift will be preUy. acceptable and
cheap.
But If you want to put a little more
time and a little more money into it you
can get up something a great deal nicer.
Suppose you make a Pareee bag. It should
be eight inches across and twelve inches
long. The Parsee bag is to hold fancy
work, and must be large enough for a
big piece of embroidery.
This bex is unllned and its foundation
Is a piece of satin. You can use cloth.
If you prefer and for this a sort of shiny
faced ladles' 'doth Is good. Let It be thin
and have It of an oriental color.
Good oriental tones are dull brown,
about the shade of strong coffee, deep
red; the color called watermelon pink.
a ripe green and a purple that is rather
too vivid for western ideas of beauty.
Your background does not matter so
much, for you are going to work your
bag almost entirely over with fancy
.stitches and the background will disap
pear;.
Hemember that your Parsee bag is to be
unllned and that therefore Its reverse side
must be done neatly, no long stitches and
no mixed up threads.
If you want to be decidedly oriental
in your work you can get come tiny
pieces cf isinglass and cut them about
the size of dimes. Apply them to the
roods and work a buttonhole stitch
around them to hold them In place. Try
it and you will soon get the kaack. Keep
*C9 working, one row of stitches around
the other, until you have ftiade a great
wheel. You can use gless spangles If you
prtfer. or any tiny, 6hlny bit of em
broidery material.
And little crocheted wheels, made by
crocheting a fancy stitch over little cur-
Xain pole rings, are applied to the bag
BO as to form a pattern. And so you keep
on. working and designing, and working,
until your bag is covered with handiwork.
Run a stout cordâ not a ribbonâ through
the: top and you have a handsome Christ
mas present.
A Decorated Plate.
The day of hand painting has not gone,
but in this latter generation hand paint
ing is done in more sensible ways than
formerly. If you are going to hand paint
a plate, or plaque, or any large object,
you begin not by designing, but by get
ting the plate stamped.
You can take your plate to a decorator

One of the nouveau art plaques was
taken by an ambitious woman to the
studio of a real artist: "Paint me some
angels upon the middle." said she, "and
Co it Quick."
cot too smooth, you can take it to a
clamper's and actually have it stamped.
With your pattern mapped out for you
you go to work to paint You will want
tÂ« p*int in German colors, bright blues
*nd, vivid reds; and you must put tne
new art touch into your work by placing
figures upon it somewhere.
The artist painted a few angels "quick"
and the woman called for the plaque and
put the finishing touches upon it at home.
She made a nice broad curving ' border,
and she did some handsome decorative
scenes In the open spaces.
A large plaque of this kind Is orna
mental when not actually in use. It makes
a charming decoration for the dining
room and is Just the thing for occasional
table use. One hostess insists upon using
a china plate of this kind as a center
piece upon which she piles fruit In sea
son. "Fruit dishes," she complains,' "are
always -too 1 small, but In the Â¦ middle ' of
this plaque I can set a whole ' pineapple
and around it I can pile the other fruit,
making a real harvest home centerpiece."
Another covers the center of her plate
with a doily and uses It for ears of boiled
corn, which; are served to a large family
in this manner. Still ) another reserves
such a plaque for side table use, carving
a watermelon from it
The new art collars and Â° cuffs are well
The latest acquisition to the family of
Christmas table-covers consists of a strip
of heavy ' stuff about a . foot > wide. This
is trimmed at each end with a crocheted
edge, done in colored. twine.
Twine, by the way will be largely used
In Christmas decoration. ., It makes a nice
border; .Instead of fringe, and can be
worked with a crochet hook and sewed
on the material. Again twine is used for,
the : making of small wheels. These are
worth a place in the Christmas work
ers' work basket They are made out of
canvas, or denim, scrim or coarse linen.
The coarser the material the better the
result. And they are cut in the shape of
a wide turn-over band for the neck. And
there are wide turn-over cuffs for the
wrists.
Alter the linen, or canvas, scrim, or
whatever other heavy white material is
employed, has been cut into collar and
cuff shapes the hand of tne worker takes
hold. The collar and cuffs can be drawn
with open work, If desired. But if open
work Is too difficult or too trying to the
eyes, there are other ways . of managing.
I One lovely pair of Christmas cuffs Is
made of very heavy plain white linen, (
deep and beautiful In texture. Around the
edge of the cuffs there is wrought a deep
border In the shape of an embroidered
scallop, with a design below. This is
done In a gaudy red, the brightest pos
sible tone being chosen. The same Is done
for the collar.
A heavy white, canvas turn-over collar
was embroidered with a band of china
blue embroidery at least three Inches
deep and the embroidery was of the
coarse kind with long running stitches.
The collar was a beauty and now lies in
a sachet casket, to come out perfumed on
the day of Christmas giving.
\ The '. embroidered or drawn stock, the
decorated pair of linen cuffs and the
hand-made belt are all numbered very
high in . the list of popular Christmas
etfts. ;-,.Â¦ ' .
; A Christmas art, set makes , a nice
Christmas gift The art set consists of
a white' canvas belt with brass harness
buckle. The belt is an inch- wide and
is worked in cross stitch design. The

and cuffs. The whole set. laid in a pretty
blue paper box, with the name of the
owner lettered on the * outside; makes a
delightfully personal Christmas present.
Nouveau Art Table Cover. ;V '..
"He needs one, good and hard." Amy
eald - tossing her head the least bit "I
have not told anybody else. Jock, but
I'm going to marry Billy if I can ever
make him show himself properly and hu
manly foolish. He's so abnormally steady
going and sensible and settled I should
not dare try to live up to himâ unless I
knew he had a nice, silly streak some
where." . . ;I
''I suppose you wouldn't anyway con
sider me: I'm pretty near all silly
streaks," Jock said dolefully. Amy laugh
ed and patted his arm. saying: "But you
have good sense streaks, too. Jock, else
why should you like me so well? "We'll
always be the best of friends, I know."
"Bet vour bottom dollar on it!" Jock
said, hurrying her along. He was mak
ing for a tumble down summer house,
thickly overgrown with vines, that nes
tled in the very farthest corner of the
lawn. It had a plank floor, rotten and
crumbly, and a dilapidated rustic bench
along one side. A cool, deeply shaded
nook, sweet with roses and honeysuckle.
Amy sprang Joyously inside it. with Jock
at her heels. As they made to sit down
low hollow reverberations came up from
below their feet; there was a dull crush
ingâa giving wayâ then before they could
cry nut a sliding 1 down, down to dark,
dank., unknown perilous depths.
Five minutes later Billy was asking
anxiously of those about the garden chair,
"Where is Amy?" Nobody could tell
him. Presently he spied far out In the
grass one of her little lace mitts. Run
ning away from it were faint footmarks
on the warm turf. Billy followed the
marks, his face whitening fast. "Jock
could not be so cruel as to take her near
that old well house." be said to himself
â then srrnaned aloud: he had come in
sight of the well house, where the crum
bled floor told him the tale.
"Jock! Amy! Answer me! Oh, God!"
he cried aloud, peering over the crumbling
rim into the blackness. No articulate aa
swer came to him. but was it fancy that
down in the deeps of earth he heard low,
gasping moans? He sprang up with a
shout that brought the whole crowd hud
dling about him. Mrs. Brown was. at the
head, weeping and wringing her hands.
"They are lost! lost!" she moaned. "No
body ever came out of that well alive.
It's always half full of choke damp! That
iÂ«j why my father had it built over! Why
didn't I think to tell everybody?"
Billy seemed not to hear. With giant
strength he wrecked the rotten lattice,
clearing the well mouth, then flung off
coat and shoes and prepared to clamber
down. He had already sent for ropea.
"No, I can't wait, with Amy dying," he
said to those who tried to stop him. "I've
got to save her or die with her. Stand
"You may rflnd ! us engaged unless you
hurry back," .Amy flung after them.
Jock laughed aloud. "Let's hide," he said.
"I* know the very place, "Won't- it give
Billy : a jolt to come back and ! find us
missing?"
The fascinations were all very well un
til Amy Peters came. Amy was never ac
counted a beauty, but somehow she put
all the set beauties out of court and coun
tenance. Behold her at the party, trip
ping airily about the lawn, with young
Alanson at one side, Jock Illlman at the
other, and Billy Corliss tagging after,
like the faithful watchdog he was. This
while the other 'young women had less
than a Â¦ beau apiece. You will admit it
was aggravating. Kate Martin, Amy's
best friend, Bpelled upon her fingers
"P-I-G" as the train went past her. But
Kate was not In the least angry or Jeal
ousâshe had Bobby Shepherd all to her
self, although Essie Brown had done her
best to lure the gentleman away.
"Let me tell you about Miss Amy,"
Jock said to the stranger, when presently
Amy was safely enthroned In a garden
chair, with her court still about her.
"She's nearly the only girl in Eastbrldge
you don't have to court, whether or no
you want toâ"
"But you know you always want to,
Jocky, dear." Amy said saucily. Billy
Corliss laughed with the rest, but some
how the laugh did not get into his eyes.
Young Alanson kept up ! the game J brave
ly. ."Can you- imagine a live man not
wanting to?" he asked of the world In
general and Billy in particular. Billy put
on his most reflective look. ."There might
be extenuating circumstances," he . said
diplomatically. Amy gave him a reproach
ful ' glance, and said . loftily: | "I j suppose.
Billy, your extenuating circumstances
.wear frocks. Pray, does it happen by
any chance that the most extenuating* of
them is named Clarissa Brown-?"
. "No," Billy said sturdily, shaking his
head. "But that reminds me, neither Mr.
Alanson nor I have more than said
'howdy* to Miss Clarissa. Jock, you stay
here and keep this Quicksilver young per
son out of mischief .while we scramble
through the decent, thing."'. .

when they saw their plight, came' down
like Trojans to help. It was little short
of a miracle that any of the three g t

But now the faint light shining through
the chinks outlined the cabin door to their
eyes, and Mat soon caught the latetv

horror of the death scene Inside filled her
with dread. The stranger came up the
steps and stood beside her. It was a long
silence. Mat stood with her head pressed
against the door, the unpulled latch

stranger's arm slipped about her waist,
and the girl made no resistance.

ber of the family. All morning he had
been wondering - uneasily for whom
the storm was brewing, and as
her husband - bad gotten out of the
house unscathed he feared that be was In
for it. He was standing by x the window
now, looking out aimlessly, wishing that
It were over and yet not daring to avoid
it, and when she entered * the room In
which he stood, clearing her throat em
phatically, he turned toward her with a
shiver of apprehension. He was a stout
man, with an air of mild .Indecision about
himâ about bis soft sandy hair, about his
broad, rounded shoulders, about even his
easy grayish lace sack coat.
â¢The Idea of marrying that silly little
fool, without a cent to her name, and at
your age, too."
Her brother-in-law had not really bad
an intention of any sort In regard to the
widow; Indeed, he had never bad a de
cided Intention In regard to anything since
Mrs. Dlbbs bad taken possession. Never
theless, he felt mildly Indignant enough
to make a faint report. "Who told you?"
"Who told me?" she burst out. "Who
told me? Why, hasn't the little fool her
self been telling It all around the town
that you wanted to marry her and"â In
a high simpering falsettoâ "that she
didn't know whether she ought to think
of It or not., but that Mr. Dlbbs was such
a nice rr*"". and such a friend to her
poor, dear Arthur, and she would hate
to disappoint himâ oh,. the Idiot!"
Jonathan Dibbs looked thoughtful.- Sud
denly the figure of the widow in ques
tion appeared before bis mind's eye. It
was a neat, retiring little figure, with
soft- brown hair and a small face, slight
ly sunburned, but sweet and tender, and
with an individuality of Its own that only
a patient, conscientious life could have
given It. He compared It with the large
obtrusive face 1 and figure of his sister
in-law, and gradually be began to smile.
A sudden sense of relief came to him In
the contemplation of the little widow, and
a strange, unusual sense of pleasure; the
Joy of the awakening of a desire and a
will In him which : he s had never before
voice, and a tone whose anxiety did not
Â¦ refer to catching the train. . -
. "I don't "know." she began slowly. "I
didn't know we . meant to get married.
But If you wish It very muchâ oh. dear!"
She hid her face suddenly In bis coat.
"Now go," he said after a little, '"be
cause we want to catch that train. And
wear that blue thing you have, with the
white spotsâ you know."
. She smiled tremulously. No one had
ever noticed her clothes before, and she
had always half worshiped him, anyhow,
and now she was very much confused and
very happy.
They managed to catch the train' by
means of a little running for It and they
rode Â¦ gayly and breathlessly away from
borne toward the city. She stole a look at
bis beaming face and after a while gath
ered courage to speak.
"Jonathan," she said softly, "how did
Iâ what did 1 Ao to make you thfn> O f
this?" I never hopedâ"
He laughed. "Call ma Jack." he said
with a blush. They used to call him Jack
when he was a big. slow, good-natured
schoolboy. "And what -you did was to
make a man of, me. that is all," he con
tinued. Then after a while be laughed
again. "We have . my Â¦ sister-in-law to
thank for some "of this." he remarked
slowly, "but," he turned to her and spoke
with sudden emphasis, "but you must not
let it grieve you if we never have a
chance to express our gratitude."
"What a . foolâ what a fool I used to
be!" he thought. "What a fool a man Is
any now to let a woman ride over him at
her />wn sweet will. And to think that I
stood It for twelve years and never
thought of breaking away! It must have
been the widow, bless her heart!" Here
he smiled to himself sentimentally, and
wondered how she would take It, the "it"
In question being the" plan he .was going*
to propose to her.
He -flung the gate of the little yard
wide open and walked quickly along the
path by the side of the house. The widow
was on the porch ' ironing out ; some lace
when he approached; and she looked up
with 'face aglow when she perceived who
It was. He lost no time in announcing
the object of his visit. He took her bands

hands. "You mistook me for him, so we
must look'a little bit alike. But I disown
the likeness. You would not have had to
wait for me. not If the stars had fallen."
"Ahem! Suppose that other girl heard
you now?" Marna said wickedly, her lids
lowered, a naive smile lurking about her
lips. John pressed her band and drew It
upon his arm, saying only: "Keep close to
me, the path Is narrow and I mustn't let
you get wet." But Marna appeared to
feel sufficiently answered. She smiled
more winsomely than ever at him, and
raid, as they came out In the clear lawn:
"Cousin Johnâ we are cousins, you know,
your uncle Is my stepfather aa well as
guardianâ will you do something- for my
asking, and not misunderstand?"
"Certainly," Trevor said, smiling him

then said hurriedly: "Don't say anything
about anything until morning. Poor Papa

him both her hands: "If you'll only run

miss them, but there seemed nothing* else

In this Instance she rewarded Danbury's
confidence by bringing him face to face
with the victoria once more as he emerged
from the Square. By her quick avoidance
of his glance, be saw that the girl recog
nized him, and at the knowledge a sud
den glow suffused him. . He felt as if their
lives were already upon the loom of des
tiny. Without a moment's hositation he
stopped a passing cab, and with a few
hurried words to the driver. Jumped In.
"Do you happen to know the Gran
villes of East Twentieth Street V he In
quired of Bartram, with whom he dined
that night, for he had learned so much
more a poet that # he never attempted to
write verses, drew a sigh of delight. In
some Inexplicable way she epitomized all
the charm of life to himâ the scont of
Cawers â the tenderness of wpmanhoot'.
She seemed the lilacs transmuted into
femininity, and his glance Involuntarily
traveled from her to the blossom in h":s
hand, while hers followed with a little.
Quick, unconscious flicker of appreciation.
The carriage rolled on and he went his
way with thoughts that were but a bliss
ful blur of lilac maidens and lilac bloom.
Under the thick foliage of the trees in
Madison square he sat down to pull him
self together.
"Ridiculous!" he argued sagely. "A
man of SS to lose his head over the
glimpse cf an ordinary girl In a pale
tinted gown."
At last he rose and straightened himself
with a quick, sharp decision of manner
which those who knew him had learned
to recognize as a sign of determination.
She was The Woman! Absurd as it
was, he felt exultantly positive of that.
And for the restâ well, he had a calm
confidence in himself. He would surely
find her and win her.
"But that is my risk." was the answer.
"and I am not afraid. May we call this
beginning of the beginning?" and he
.smiled, down at her with a lowk In his
eyes tnat quickened the beating of her
heart deliciously. Â¦ ,
The end of the beginning came about
a year later. The lilacs "had made their
appearance In the city once more, heaped
upon the push carts at the curb, where
their haughty sistersâ the roses and vio
letsâwould sometimes stare disdainfully
out at them from behind the 'plate glass

been passing through x East Twentieth

ber brownstone residences. The man was
In the regulation tweeds with his gloves
grasped flrml" In one hand, and the girl
was Kowned In lilac of a shade as'elu
sive and beautiful as a memory. #
At the sight of the gorgeously decorated'
carriage that awaited them they half hesi
tated. Then, as a shower of something
fine, white and hard as hailstones began
to patter about their beads, they dashed
down precipitously and gladly availed
themselves of its protection.

waited breathlessly for her to speak. By
her answer he would know. whether he
had read her arieht.
"Oâ oh!" she Â«a id with a little gasp.
"It Is too beautiful!" There was a sus
picious humidity in her eyes, but she
lifted them bravely to his and continued:
"I am not worthy anything ao poetical
and beautiful as this, and when you
come to know me you will find it out.
I should hate thatâ having you discover
what a commonplace Â¦ girl 1 1 am." She
stopped and tried to steady her some
what, tremulous lips. \
So he threw prudence to the winds and
after it diplomacy and convention, and
stood before her the man that he was,
telling her how It had happened how
he had come back to New York and how,
even before he had seen them, the scent
of the lilacs had taken him back to his
boyish days; how she had appeared sud
denly, clothed In the very colors of his
dream. All this he told her rapidly and
earnestly, and as only a clean souled,
natural man could have done. Then he
There was a vague disapproval In her
voice, but not enough to make him de
epair of forgiveness. Besides, her ques

woman, and that in the midst of a. so
ciety bound by precedent she dared to be
herself.
There were several other guests present,
but at the end of a quarter of an hour
Danbury and she were separated from
them by enough space to make confi

And so, before many days elapsed, he

Something had to be settled out of hand

NIGHT CALL AT THE FERRY
-By Helen T. Quig'gYhand, your heart responded to him, eh?
You'ir pardon me, Miriam, but you re
mind me forcibly of the Irishman who
was too tender hearted to dock his -log's
ears at one fell stroke, ho he cut them a

Miriam, winced, reddening. The truth
sounds so different, Btrlppfd of pictur

".You want me to go In with" you, vir

gravely. "At "the. risk .of appearing un

flattering offer. I don't know much about
such things, but It seems to. me. If I
didn't care to go into partnership with a

marry you, for Instance, Miriam, you
wouldn't take it as unfriendliness on my

Her downcast eyes missed the fact that
he was watching her Â¦ narrowly. She
got up.
"I don't know if I've the nerve to do

in his averted face. Bhe sighed softly. A
moment later he heard the swish of ber

his cigar. â¢
"In v . one respect," he groaned, "women

phase of womanhood! Then he smiled
grimly. .
"So, I suppose,' it was your, idea to let
Forsythe down easily by giving him; to
understand' that, although I held your
"Well!" he Eald shortly, "I should think
you could disabuse him of the idea easily
enough.
Miriam's brown eyes widened.
"You must think It Is prime fun, Bart
Graham, to boldly tell a . good friend
right to his face that you. don't care for
him, especially when he's such a dear old
fellow!", she said, with a; little quiver to
her voice. . . â¢ â¢.,-Â¦*'
"That's Just It," she rejoined, hopeless

derstand that I -do care for him, for all
my seeming Indifference. In fact, they've
done nearly all the courting, themselves."
Graham's lips curled.
"Why don't you tell him the truth?" he
said at last "He's man enough to stop
his attentions, if he knows they're un
welcome"

Graham took his feet off the window

"Engaged?" he repeated dubiously. .
Miriam nodded.
s "It's only for a couple of days." she
hastened to reassure him. "Mr. Forsythe
is coming to propose, and I'm at my wits'
end. I haven't a single excuse for refus

nice looking. Mother won't hear an ob

only way is to let him understand, ever
so delicately, that I'm not free to listen
to him. Nobody will know, for he Isn't
the sort to repeat confidences."
Graham lay back in his chair and sur

"If you've no objection to him, why don't
you marry him?" he inquired.
"I thejght I made It clear that I didn't
want to," Bhe explained, with a note of
Injury 'in her voice. "I'm sure. If you
don't wish to help me out, - Bart, you

HER CHAPTER OF PROPOSALS
By Hattie P. Rider
"Why did 70a nrnP Ton might have known yon could not escape me," said her pursuer as he came up.
"Hey?" mused Gottlieb, two weeks lat
er, when his gray-green eyes devoured
four closely printed lines In the personal
bf the Western Prairie Farmer. "Hey,

In the old country the widow had an
oncle. Beventy years of age was the
oncle. and at 70 oncWs sometimes die. To
Gottlieb and to Hans of that oncle she
had often spoken, yah! yah! Eight thou

Ach. but Hans, be haaf dat much, too,

Ohone!" and again the widow sighed.
Truly for this caution the widow had
good cause. Before marriage, the late
Herr Stahl, like the present suitors, had
been weighed In the balance and found
"not wanting." After marriage, a long.
long, practical sermon he had preached,
the text of which bad been "The waste
of precious love." And now, "L<oofe,

widow.** m!t such tings as dat I haaf not

For her man, Gottlieb or Hans, which

Now, to her name the Widow Stahl had

"And would it be so hard, little girl, to

"Yesâ yes !" she sobbed, "but not as

How am I to tell you? What will you
think of me? I ought not to be here to

It was a confession punctuated By sobs

A DRESDEN SHOPHERDESS
- Two hours later Cicelyâ no. not Cicely,
but a Dresden china shepherdessâ who
had stolen away from her own life and
forgotten all Its cares, found herself one
of a hundred or two other gay, fantas

beneath soft lights to the dreamy niuslo

At first it was enough Just to sit there,

THE BASIS OF AN ENGLISH SPEAKING ALLIANCE
&y ; ?/ze> 'm&^^mf^^^^^Wim
\_^E^" ' â¢ J C^5I F the dominating influences that govern our- age none is
?Â£JÂ£?r*^fei'^ more conspicuous than the tendency to great agglomera
i/$'"$**&$ ti 005 based upon an affinity of race, language or creed.
, S E*f<>jÂ£?ls V The Pan-Slavonic movement, which is sp powerful in East
iXtfirt^sk ern politics; the Pan-Germanic movement, which seeks to
*p$k^2$Q gather the Teutonic nations under one rule; the move
rfo53=srsjQdyj ment which made United Italy and which, under the name
of Italia irredenta, aspires to still further absorptions,
are conspicuous instances, and there is little doubt that the two first, at
least, are destined to play a considerable part in the future. There was a
time when it seemed not beyond the limits of possibility that the whole
English-speaking race might be comprised in a single empire, but the blun
dersânot wholly on one sideâ of the public men of the eignteenth century de
stroyed the prospect, and no one now seriously believes that England and
the United States are ever destined to form part of one commonwealth. At
the same time the old jealousies and animosities which once divided them
have in England wholly disappeared and in the United States greatly di
minished, and the idea has been steadily growing that in foreign politics the
very first aim of an English statesman should be to establish close and
friendly relations with the United States, and that one of the most impor
tant aims of domestic policy should be to draw as close as possible the con
nection between the mother country and her colonies. The oid notion that
so long prevailed under the influence of the Manchester school that the
colonies were little better than an embarrassment, a danger and an expense
to be held for a short time under tutelage and* then completely seoarateri
from the mother country, finds now but few supporters. The pride in the
growth and greatness of the empire, and in the manifest destiny of the Eng
lish-speaking nations that are arisinc beyond the ocean, has steadilv in
creased, and at no former period of English history has the moral tie bind
ing us to our colonies been as powerful as at present.
The Constitution of fclhe United States
England and the United States are separate bodies, and in manv re
spects they move upon different planes. Their forms of government arc.
essentially different England posse*. ses in the fullest sense of the word a
parliamentary government, though fhere are 'some signs that the almost
complete omnipotence of the British House of Commons is on the decline.'
Still the Cabinet, though its power in the state is evidently increasing, is
in the last resort the creature of the House of Commons, which can at anv
moment overthrow it The practical power of the House of Lords on aues
tions in which public opinion is seriously interested amounts to little morÂ«Â»
than a brief suspensory veto which terminates when the popular verdict has
been decisively pronounced, and a power of introducing in the interest of mi
norities some modifications or attenuations of the measures which the ma
jority of the Commons has carried: while the power of the crown is still
less and is chiefly indirect. In the American constitution, on the v other
hand, Congress can only act within the limits of a written constitution *
watched over and controlled bv a errat legal tribunal, and the power* of the
â¢President and of the Senate larpelv exceed those of the British sovereign
and House of Lords. England is also by her position in the world an emi
nently free trade country, and so large a predominance of her trade is with
foreign countries that it seems scarcely possible that her fiscal policv can
â¢be very materially changed, while America is strongly protectionist. Prob
ably a more serious fact in affecting the future relations of the. two coun
tries is a growing divergence of racial elements,, for the vast flow of Euro-
pean emigration to America is constantly reducing the proportion of tht
Anglo-Saxon and even of the Teutonic race in* the American population. Yet
with all this there remains a far theater community of thought and feeling
between England and the United States than between England and anv
foreign European country. The English common law lies at the foundation
of the American legal system. Thr two nations have the same language, the
same dominant race, and in a measure the same history and the same tradi
tional sympathies and characteristics. They have -grown up under the in
fluence of a common literature and a substantially identical creed. At thÂ«
very time when politicians were doing most to alienateVthe two great Eng
lish-speaking communities Weslev and Whitefield were laying the basis of a
far deeper and more intense spiritual communion between them, and their
moral type is substantially the samÂ«.
They read the same books, admire chiefly the same qualities, judge bv
the same standards, cultivate the same ideals. With some manifest limita
tions, both intellectual and moral, both communities are very eminently, en-
dowed with the political sense, with the old Roman gift of governmjr men.
England has shown it in. the iuoreme achievement of her Indian empire,
in the skill and power with which in more modern times she regenerated
Egypt; in the success of her colonial enterprises;, in the success __ of her
parliamentary government. America has shown it not less conspicuously
.in the skill with which her Anglo-Saxon people have dominated and assimi
lated the vast heterogeneous elements which European emigration haÂ»
poured upon her shores, and built up out of these discordant and often re
fractory ingredients one of the greatest powers upon earth. In both coun
tries, too, this governing power rests mainly upon the same characteristics
â good "sense- â the spirit of compromise â a strong and persevering yet tem
perate energy â a deep reverence for individual liberty, for religious libertv
and for freedom of discussion, a rare power of distinguishing the practical
and the feasible from showy speculation and rhetorical artifice and hastv
generalizations.
Many clouds hang over the futnre destinies of the human race, but it
is at least a safe prediction. that the part which will be played by the Eng
lish speaking world must steadily grow. It comprises the most rapidly in
creasing, the most progressive, the nxost happily situated nations of the
earth, and if their power and influence are not wasted in internal quarrels,
their type of civilization must one day be completely dominant. They have
hitherto escaped the militarism that is so prevalent on the Continent. Their
civilization' is essentially commercial and pacific, and though it has its
marked defects it is. not too much to say that in no other form has true lib
erty been better understood and a larger and fuller scope been given to
human develftpment and individual energy.
Closer Diplomatic Relations.
Â¦ - ' -
. â¢ The revelation during the South African war of the intense dislike of
England that prevails in the nations of the Continent has powerfully tended
to draw English sympathies to kinsmen beyond the sea. and the succession
of American representatives, in London of very remarkable ability and
popularity has done much to consolidate the two countries. In the great
problems that are arising in the East, the policy of the "open door,"
adopted on both sides of the Atlantic, has formed a new and powerful bond
of commercial and political interest, and the cordial co-operation of the
two nations is an essential condition of success. At the same time the Irish
party in America, which had for many years been the most active agency in
producing and inflaming an anti-English feeling, and which long obtained
a very disproportionate influence both in municipal government and the
press, is manifestly declining, both in influence and numbers.
It does not appear to me probable that the relations of the two nations
will take the form of any general or permanent alliance. On both sides of
the water the feeling in favor of reserving full liberty of action is very
strong, and each country has large classes of interests with which the other
is almost unconcerned. English opinion now cordially acquiesces in the
Monroe doctrine, which places the greater number of American questions
entirely within the sphere of influence of the United States, while America
is happily free from all obligation to meddle with purely European compli
cations. Limited alliances aiming at special objects, such as a freedom of
commerce in the East, may very probably arise, but on the whole the unity
of the -English-speaking races is likely to depend much more on the increas
ing power of common sympathies, common principles and common inter
ests Both countries are essentially democratic, and the broad basis of
popular sentiment must be the foundation of their friendship.
USE OF INCENTIVES IN CHILD TRAINING
SECOND TALK TO PARENTS
By Win. J. iSHearer, A. M. Pd.D.
(i f âA ERY early in life the child learns that certain actions are
''c^PB>*(^^^f followed by pleasant sensations, while others are not. Al
' iS^Jat/ 1 Â® most intuitively he strives to secure the one and to avoid
the ot^ cr - Soon the desire for the pleasant sensations
r\i$Jl/Â£-k becomes so strong that it acts as an incentive to action.
T%gf!af/LQJj As the child grows older the incentives which appeal
ygjS$5^Â£^_ L to V.*m increase in number, grow in power and rise in
character. Consciously or unconsciously they influence
the wilV determine action, fix habits, mold the character, and make certain
the destiny of all, both for time and eternity. Since they do so vitallv af
fect the present and future of us all. much attention should be given bv
parents to the consideration of that influence upon children.
It is a hundred times easier to lead th^n to drive. Too few parents
appreciate the importance of this truth. A still smaller number understand
the proper use of right incentives. In the past too much time and energy
have been wasted in unsuccessful attempts to drive children into right^ ways,
and too little thought given to plans of leading them, by pleasant" expe
riences and anticipations, to prefer the correct paths. All who have studied
children closely will agree that, if started right, most of them can be led eas
ily all the time; that all can be led most of the time, and that few. if any,
need be driven much of the time. Why, then, should a child be constantly
driven if he can more easily be lei most of the time? How important,
then, that we learn to lead when it is possible to do so, arid drive only when
wf must
The Desire for Comfort.
Beginning with the lowest in the scale, the desire for comfort is one
t)f the very earliest of incentives. As before stated, while yet a babe in the
mother's arms the child discovers that some acts are followed by personal
comfort, and others by unpleasant sensations. The one great desire is to se
cure the pleasant and avoid what is unpleasant. This natural desire largely
determines the conduct of individuals all through life.
If the child's treatment is uniform these associations, being made fre
quently, leave their impress, and the child becomes aware of a law of con-;
duct outside of itself.f This is the will of the parent. or other person in au
thority. Very^soon the child learns that it pays "to., avoid all acts- which'
result in pain or discomfort. So' well is this lesson learned that few bad hab
its would be formed if unpleasant results uniformly followed improper
acts. ' Â¦ '"â¢.. \ '.->"Â¦' - : ' Â¦
The fear of some kind of punishment is a powerful. incentive to right
conduct. Though one of the very lowest, yet it is an incentive of. which
most parents must make use 'frequently at first. r .
While it should not be used when it is possible to reach the desired
end by any higher, the fact remains that with far too large a proportion
of children and adults it is the fear of the consequences that generally pre
vents the improper action.
Rewards and Prizes.
The natural desire for some objective recognition of right conduct al
ways acts as a powerful incentive with most children." Considered simply as
such, regardless of their intrinsic value, they may easily be replaced by in
centives of a higher kind. The great danger of prizes is found in the fact
that unless great care is taken the chlld*"will be led to act merely for the
love of the prize. In this, as in- everything else, the child is. a creature of
the present, and if powerfully influenced by the expectation of some little re
ward soon, rather than by the hope of some great reward in the distant fu
ture.
Quite early the young child learns, unconsciously, fro'm the tone of the
mother's voice, and from her smile or frown, that certain acts are an
proved, while others are not. This incentive to proper conduct increases
with the age of the child. So powerful does it become,- if. carefully used,
that scarcely any other incentive of punishment will be needed. Would
that parents would grasp the truth of this statement 1 How dearly do the
little ones prize the parents' approval ! They are not only made happy by
the praise received, but also because of the added pleasure which comes
from the consciousness of having given their parents pleasure.
' The commendation of a stranger is very pleasant to a child; that of a
friend or companion- still sweeter; but the smile of approval, the sympathetic
"Well done," "You are a dear boy," "That is a good girl," or similar ex
pressions of a loved parent, is the sweetest fruit of a child's earnest efforts.
Parents, is it not true that few of us have made use of this incentive as often
as we should? It is not yet too late to prove the power of this method.
From this desire for the approval of the parent there will gradually arise
a desire for the approbation of one's own conscience j then ' of all whose
opinion is valued, and finally that of the Supreme Being.
Confidence of Parents.
If the child can be made to feel that the frequent approval of the lov
ing parent has resulted in securing the confidence of the parent, he will
prize nothing better than the retention of that confidence. No pain will
sink deeper into his soul than the temporary loss of this parental confi
dence.
Influenced by other incentives and various considerations, the child will
gradually form habits of action. These habits of action will tend to repeat
themselves. For this reason they will result in a strong though unconscious
incentive to right conduct.
Slowly there develops the idea that certain things should be done because
they are right, and others avoided for the reason that they are wrong. While
this idea is very weak at first, yet generally by the time the child enters
school it has become apparent. While at this time the child's principal law
of conduct must still be the will of the parent or other one in authority, it
should not be forgotten that embryonic conscience is striving feebly to see
the light of duty. * v .= ;
The pleading of an enlightened conscience is the highest incentive to
which any one can respond. This requires not merely that 4he child see
what is right, but also demands a determination to do right because it is
right. This means the culture of the will, that most important of all ob
jects of culture.
AN EASTERN DIVINE'S STARTLING PLAN WHICH HAS RAISED A STORM

(Hev. Charles VT. Spicer, rector of St. * John's Splacopal Million la Cln
clnatl, Ohio, h&m created a veritable Â¦torm of Olsonuicn and criticism hy his
bold advocacy of church, ownership of saloons. So much, indeed, has been
Â¦aid that the reverend rentteman was constrained to' write the following? over
his own signature to define exactly what his radical remedy does mean.) '
f xâ ---^a 1 MONG the various problems with which the church of to-
Lil^S^&^f ay as to ** ca * t * lcrc ' s none which concerns her more
â¢K^/fa^A â¢ vitally than that of the saloon. She has come to regard
*^^^^a> e Â£a ' oon an( * ' ts accessories as her most formidable an-
tagonist. She sees in it a menace to the moral and spir-
T^Ltv^Â«uv * tua l welfare of the rising generation. Being chiefly con-
Jg&BMzmEJBz, cerned herself with this phase of man's life, she, therefore,
views with jealousy and fear the growing influence of this
foe, while, on the other hand, she beholds with sorrow and sadness the ap
parent loss of her own influence.
A visit to most of our city churches on Sunday will reveal a congrega
tion composed chiefly of women, with a few gray-haired men, while the
young men are notably absent. At the same time drinking resorts, clubs, bil
liard halls and kindred institutions will be doing a flourishing business,. In
the rural districts, where churches are about the only attraction, the situation
is different
The reason for this is not because men no longer recognize the worth
of the church, nor because the church has lost its power or has served its
purpose and is now in decay. The church/ 'Â« Â«fH1 what it has ever been, the
world's supreme instrument of good. If Â«h the same life and power
as of old, and its mission is still unfulfilled,
No, the reason for the church's failure to attract men is not because of
any innate or essential weakness, but because she has failed to employ
adequate means. She has relied too much Â£n her essential power and has
not sufficiently utilized human agency. She has gone on pursuing anti
quated and obsolete methods, while the saloon and allied powers have called
to their aid every means at their command. The result is that .opposing
forces have augmented their attractive influence to such a degree that
young men have been drawn away from the church and no longer como
into contact with her essential power.
- The modern saloon is a palace of superficial splendor, employing all the
most alluring arts in the interest of its cause. Within are to be found recrea
tion, divergence, excitement, amusement, refreshments, freedom, welcome, so
cial good fellowship and all those things which enable man to forget the more
serious affairs of. life and to indulge in a restful sort of pleasure that is sooth
ing, refreshing and invigorating after the intense strain of business. Un
fortunately, in addition to these healthful, and not undesirable, attractions,
when indulged in temperately, there are other influences of an immoral and
degrading character. Here, it seems to me, lies the chief danger of the sa
loon. Eliminate the filth and immorality and substitute moral purity, and
much of the danger will be averted. , .
The time has come when we must lay aside sickly sentiment and Irra
tional theories and take a practical view of the question. The saloon is here,
a fixed institution, in jour political and social life, to which it clings like a
leech. It supplies certain elements which seep to be necessary in man's
life. There is a kind of "nervosity" characteristic of our age which make*
a certain measure of excitement and diversion necessary in human life.
In primitive times, when life was crude and physical force prevailed,
men were content to sit down and rest after physical exhaustion. To-day
brain force is the chief factor in human activity, and when the brain is
weary the active mind seeks rest in change of employment. The saloon of
fers the means of the mental rest which man seeks. And when I speak of
the saloon I speak of it in the broad, general serfse, as the center of various
allied institutions, such as clubrooms. billiard halls, etc, which are included
within its scope.
,. Now, what is the remedy? The evil influence of the saloon, its antagon
gjsm, spiritually, to the church, are facts generally conceded, but how to cure
"the evil is the question.;
We have tried prohibition, but prohibition does not prohibit.
Substitution is now being tried." While this is a step in the right direc
tion, it is not adequate to meett the needs of the case.
There still remains a remedy \ikich as yet has not been employed in any
very general sense, and that is" church control. . Let the church take charge
of the saloon, purify and refine it, eliminating everything of an immoral na
ture and utilize it for its own profit It has already done this with respect to
billiards and pool and certain games formerly monopolized by the saloon,
and it has "been found beneficial. .
Why may the church not be benefited by control of the saloon? Thus
she might establish a business department which in time would meet all "her
running expenses. The time has come when she can no longer pose as a
merely spiritual institution, but must reach out and lay her hands, so to
speak, on all forms of human activity, business, social and spiritual.
She must disarm her enemv. capture his guns, strip them of the insignia
of crime, stamp them with a holier badge and employ them in her own de
fense.
It is less difficult to make men see the folly of intemperance than to per
suade them to the necessity of total abstinence. Surrounded by right in
fluence, they will learn to use these things as they are intended, for the ad
vancement of their higher welfare. Besides, they will be in_ touch with the
church and her spirit, and will gradually become molded in her wavs of
thought and life. , C W. SPICER.fvâ^_^ Vâ4OP. gentlemen, have

CUPID, THE. FLOWER BOY
The woman who has lived in single blest*
edness and single crankiness has uncon
sciously fostered a lot of eccentricities
that have embittered her and given the
cynical tinge to her Judgments of others.
No woman is ever so lovable as when
surrounded in all the glory of wlf ahood,
with its crowning consecration of mother
hood. 'It is then that she Is as near akin
to the angels as mortals ever dare hope
to be*
In the happy home that is Earth's re
flection of Heaven.
A woman may be successful on the
stage, she may become a power in the
literary world, she may be thÂ« exponent
of theories, and a demonstrator of the
most abstruse problems of science, , She
may plead most successfully at the bar,
and thrill her audiences with the magia
of eloquence as she expounds truths that
fairly electrify her and make her a tri
umph on the rostrum: sh* may. be most
successful In the management of business
concerns. In fact, woman has wonder
fully and wondrously proven herself to
be man's eaual in the busy sace of life's
busier world, but, after all, her real glory
lies not in the race wherein she figures
as man's equal, often ms superior, but
she is at her 'best as Nature's ravishing
understudyâ the ' j wondrous mystery of
motherhood.
The woman who poses as "So good,"
and yet who Is often more malicious than
good, knows that her word will not be
questioned, hencÂ© her criticisms are mor*
cruel.
Injustice that oft assails one who hardly
understands it.
The narrow-minded woman can Bay
more mean things and create a more ad
verse impression while posing as a saint
than the unfortunate victim of her malice
can outlive In a lifetime, and this Is the
She Is good herself without being
straight-laced, but her heart 's full of
that charity to which the woman who
poses as being "Oh, so good," Is an ab
solute stranger.
She makes herself agreeable and her
home happy, and therein lies her charm.
She sees no harm In entertaining a man
friend, tete-a-tete, consequently would not
think of remarking an acquaintance who
Indulged the same Informal pleasure.
She Is not handicapped bv convention
alities, nor is she hunting for the bad in
others, wherein to criticise, or, worse
still, to gossip about, preferring to see
only the good that appeals to her.
She may be the subject of remark or
even of gossip herself, though seldom In
dulging In the lack of consideration it
Implies, for, above all, your true woman
of the world Is gracious, tactful and char
itable In her judgments, merciful In her
condemnations, and, being neither a prude
nor a blue-stocking, accomplishes a world
of good by a timely defense of onÂ© whom
the world may judge harshly or even un
justly.
woman, unlefÂ»Â«, o5 course, she be of such
a type as It were almost profanity to call
by the sacred name of woman. One who
has fallen so low, of course, does not
figure among the women whom we' ana
lyze, but even such a one whose record
Is far from being saintly is often a better
companion for a man than other men
may be, because in the majority of in
stances although she knows herself to be
beyond the ken of good woman, yet a cer
tain amount of pride and self-respect Im
pels her to crave the esteem and good
opinion of the one man whose friendship
she prizes above all others.
The woman of the world knows the
vices of men and the frailties of women.
She calculates each to a nicety, while
shutting her, eyes to both.

After a prolonged rummage behind the

the making up of scraps as sure as James
was a foot high.
A bit further on, he concluded, James
was to get out and deliver Halght's roses,
while he, Kelly, would make two stops
down a side street and overtake him.
Haight was No. Â£12, right near St. Cath

James glanced up. "St. Catherine's," hs
repeated.
"Hospital." explained Kelly. "North

"Which gets the most?"

James said It was, and sighed.

a\YF~Z~*$$$i I Â°* tllem - * l was i us ' the place to go for a picnic, but it's been my experience that a fellow does
ls\ .aJy^'/^iv^ I ' n ost of his picnicking before he's married. .
\0r2m ff^T- I Your ma did the. cooking and I hustled for things to cook, though I would take a shv at it
!^vJ*n5>Jsj Â«H ! m y se M once in a while and get up my muscle tossing flapjacks. It 'was pretty rough sailing, you
bet, but one way and another we managed to get a good deal of satisfaction out of it.- because we
had made up our minds to take our fun as we went along. With most people happiness is something that is always
just a day off. But I have made it a rule never to put off being happv till to-morrow. !
I was clerking in a general store at that time, but I had a -little weikness for livestock, even then: and while -I
couldn't afford to piunge in it exactly. I managed to buy a likelv little shoat that I reckoned on carrvinp through
the sqrnmer on credit and Dresentinc with a bill for board in the fall. He was just a pbin pig when he came to us. and
we kept him in a little sty. but we weren't long in finding out that he wasn't any ordinary root-and-grunt pig. The
first I knew your ma was calling him Toby, and had turned him loose. Answered to his name like a dog. Never
saw such a sociable pig. Wanted to sit on the porch with us. Tried to come into the house evenings. Used to run
down the road squealing for ioy when he saw me coming home from work.
Well, it got on toward November and Toby had been making the most of his opportunities. I never saw a pig
that turned corn into fat so fast, and the stouter he got the better his disposition grew. I reckon I was attached to
him myself, in a sort of a sneaking way. but I was mighty fond of hog meat, too, and we needed Tobv in the kitchen.
So I sent around and had him butchered.
When I got home to dinner next day I noticed that your ma looked mighty solemn as she set the roast of pork
down in front of me, but I strayed oft. thinking of something else, as I carved, j and mv wits were off wool gathering
sure cnoucrH when I snici * '
â¢ "Will you have a piece of Tobv. my dear?"
Well, sir, she just looked at me for a moment, and then she burst out crying and ran away from the table.
But when I went after her and asked her what was the matter she stooped crying and was mad in a minute all the
way through. Called "me a heartless, cruel cannibal. That seemed to relieve her so that she got over her mad and
began to cry again. Begged me to take Toby out of pickle and to burv him in the garden. I reasoned with her. and
in the end I made her see that any obsequies for Toby, with pork at 8 cents a pound, would be. a pretty expensive
funeral for us. But first and last she had managed to take my appetite away so that I didn't want any roast pork
for dinner or cold pork for supper.
That night I took what was left of Toby to a store-keeper at the Crossing, who I knew would be able to gaze
on his hams without bursting into tears, and got a pretty fair price for him.
I simply mention Toby in passing as an example of why I believe women weren't cut out for business â at least
for the pork-packing business. I've had dealings with a good many of them, first and last, and it's been mv expe
rience that when they've got a weak case they add their sex to it and win. and that when they've got a strong case thev
subtract their sex from it and deal with you harder than a man.. They're simply bound to win either way. and I don't
like to play a game where I haven't any show. When a clerk makes a fool break, I don't want to beg his pardon
for calling his attention to it. and I don't want him to blush and tremble and leak a little brine into a fancy pocket
handkerchief. -
A little change is a mighty soothing thing, and I' like a woman's wavÂ» too- much' at home to care very much
for them at the office. Instead of hiringwomen I try to hire their husbands and , then I usually have them both
working! for me. There's nothing like a woman at home to spur on a man at the office. .

, "They had the fifth load about half off when Bill says he heard a kind
of a sickish gurglin' noise up in the hay mow. When he'd climb up he found
Percival nearly buried out of sight, with his eyes all glassy, up and gaspin'
for breath. After the doctor'd got him brought around again so he could
stand up and dress himself the boy said he thought he'd go back home and
run- the risk about his constitution. But before he went he kind of sidled up
to Bill and, lookin' at him as respectful as though he'd of been almost a
kirg, said if Eill wouldn't care he'd iust like to shake him by the hand once
before goin' back. There's a boy that ain't lookin' down on the farmer these
cays and goin' around with the opinion that people who can't make a Hvin'
at anything else can always have fermin 1 to fall back on if it comes to a
pinch."
So I wouldn't be surprised if some of them Harvard boys might go back
to their studies almost thinkin' there's some things about farmers that ain't
hardly a lauzhin* matter.
/ Yours for the spreading of knowledge, JEFFERSON DOBBS.
."Bill worked on the wagon when the hay was being loaded and then
pitched it up to Percival in the mow when they'd hauled it in the barn. I
guess it must of been rather close and hot up there, as it generally is, and
Bill probably put the hay up purty fast. Anyway, it seems that Percival's
tc^j;ue commence^ to hang out some after they'd put in the second load, and
he wanted to know if there was any ice water on the place. After the fourth
losrl the boy seemed a little flighty. He said some strange things about
.holin' out when he would go to the cracks in the side of the barn and try
to catch a breath or two of fresh air and Bill says he was a horrible lookin'
tight, with busted blisters on his hands, his wet hair hangin' over his
face, his ears full of hay seeds and a look in his eyes showin' as plain as if
he had spoke the words right out that he hadn't the least hope of ever
Â£>ee:n\ home and mother again. . .
"It puts me in mind of Bill Hopkins, who owns a farm down in Adams
Cocsty, where I came from. I was back there secin' some of the
folks awhile ago and Bill told me about his wife's nephew comin' down
â¢from the city to git a little experience of regular farm life. Bill showed me
the letter the young man wrote. As near as I can remember it he said:
""Dear Uncle William, pa says he doesn't want to put me at work in
the bank till I've had a season's work on a farm to give me the right kind
of a constitution. The governor's a little cranky on the subject, and I sup
pose I will have to do as he wishes. He worked on a farm when he was a
boy. and thinks that's what makes him so robust now. But that's all bosh.
If he'dfcone through the course of college training that I have his constitu
tion would be three times as good as it is. This farm idea of his is the worst
"kind of rot. I can play thirtv-six holes of golf in the hottest kind of a sun
and be ni> and around the next dav as usual, but eighteen holes are as many
as he can stand. That shows what your farming amounts to. But as I sav.
I will have to humor him. so if vou don't mind I'll come down for awhile
and ta+:e the hired man's place, just for the fun of the thing.'
"Well, I s'pose Bill mebbv made it a little hard for the boy iust to take
some of the conceit out of him. but anyway when Mr. Percival got down
there it was right in the middle of the hayin' season.
. ".-Take of? your cuffs and collar,' says Bill, 'and we'll clean up the back
rrrcedow to-day if it don't rain. I'm mighty glad you came. That hired
man I had was no good on earth. He pretended it made him tired just to
milk sixteen cows before breakfast, and he was all tuckered out after he'd
pitched fifteen or sixteen ton of hav- I'll be glad to have somebody to help
that can do 2. regular day's work without lookin' as though he was goin' to
<iie.on \ - our hands.'
. "Jeff," says he. "I honor them boys for the noble stand th'ev made while
they lasted, and I'm one of them that thinks they ought to have about as
much credit for good, honest b'ravery as any of the college boys that went up
San Jtian hill that time when thev were s'posed to be hangin' back fer fur
ther orders. I think it's goin* to be a good thing fer this country, too. What
we need is to have the educated classes and the farmers brought in closer
touch with each other. There ain't been what you might call much touch
between 'em so fur, except when the farmer happened to mingle in a crowd
cf educated, refined folks and didn't keep his hand on his pocketbook. or
ir.ebby. when the farmer raked and scraped to send his boy away to get a
college education and got touched for more money every time the young
can felt like writin' to the folks at home.
"But the bonds between the farmers and some of the college graduates
are goin' to be strengthened after this. They ain't no better way to get
a. man's respect than by beatin' him at something he thinks he can do.
Every one of them Harvard boys that went to Kansas will kind of look uo
to the farmers after this and not think it's a disgrace to be distantly related
to a few of them. V- .
from Massachusetts to Kansas to hclo save the wheat is the
grandest act I ever seen. The charge of the Light Brigade ain't nowhere, al
though I will say that there's something about Sherman's ride that kind of
p^kes me think of the bovs rushin' out to the rescue. Some good willin'
poet ought to take this thing uo and do justice to it, not that I claim there's
rpifch poetry about farm work as a regular thing, but it's the nobleness of
the deed that I look at.

month. There are a number of useful things that those boys might have
been, but being only boys it was up to the old man to fill his hand befors .
When the younger son had arrived at the years generally called discre

the old man a proposition. "Father, dear father," he said. "I have long ob

Then the proud father, with the joy and alacrity of one ascending the
dentist's chair, pried himself loose from a large bunch of trouble and the
younger son got himself away to the land of baked beans and culchaw a la
mode. The elder son rejoiced at his departure with a large thrae-ply rejoio

it stirred his filial soul to a generous rivalry in the noble task of relieving

At last the young man concluded that he had brought the university td
a place where he could safely leave it â a decision in which the unlverslt*
cheerfully concurred â and he came again to his father's door. The old man
saw him â he thought that he might as well see him since he had raised him
once â and went out and fell on his neck and wept, for the dutiful son threw
his poor old father down so hard that it broke a $io bill in the old man's
pocket. The boy picked up the change before the old man had had time
to decide whether he was trying to get off a Broadway car or was officiating
at a church euchre. The youngster hadn't played center on the football
team for nothing and the old man was lucky to get a quarter back. There's
nothing like a big neck and a pair of shoulders to match it fox making people
glad to see you.
That night there was feasting and great joy in that home. The old man
ordered up the best imported headache â made in New Jersey and bottled in
Fulton street â and half a dozen stockholders a la Newburg. When the elder
son drew near and heard the sounds of merriment within he wondered much
and was exceeding wroth, so that he said: "Father, have I not also eased
you of many of your burdens and you never yet gave me even a fatted di
rector. I have stood by you â while you were making your will â I have
made your name a household word â in police stations â throughout the
length and breadth of the city, and you have given me nothing â that I have
not been willing to take." ; *â¢-- !
Then the father made answer something as follows: "Behold, this is my
son who was in Cambridge and is in New York again. He has been through
deep waters and you know how he always hated water. He has eaten husks
â at the Parker, House: I know, for I paid for the husks. Come, feel of
ydur brother's biceps and then let him severely alone."
The envious elder brother was still waxing somewhat wroth, although
the sight of, the rear elevation of his brother's biceps had reduced his vial
ibis supply of wax perceptibly, so that the old man spoke with him more to
the point. "My son, see you not where we come in? This thy brother 13
just the build for the United States Senate. His right arm lead to the }aw
will make him a mighty power in debate and do much to redress the balance
of the North against the South. Besides, it's a good thing to have a Senator
or two in the family. You can never tell when you may need one."
The old man's argument was as unanswerable as a civil service exami
nation and he sent an order to the State Legislature for one United States
Senator, prepaid, that very night. Those who have been admitted to the
secret of making United States Senators are urged to forget it and to re
member, that all things come to him who waitsâ especially to the heavy
weightsâand also that the problem of the overproduction of colleg- grad
uates has been solved at last.

The aurora borealis had passed out of thÂ«

saw her coming, a surly dog in either
hand.. At the approach of these his own
animals waxed truculent, and he favored
them- with the butt of his whip till they
quieted. He had approached the camp up
the wind, and sound was the thing to be
most feared In making his presence
known.,
"Put them. Into the sled," he ordered
when she had got -the harness on the two
dogs. "I want my leaders to the fore."
But when she had done this the dis

Though .Hitchcock plunged among them
with clubbed rifle a riot of sound went up
and across the sleeping camp.
"Now we shall have dogs and In plen

from the 'sled lashings. "Do thou harness
whichever I fling thee and between whiles
protect the team."
* He stepped a. space In advance and
waited between two pines. The dogs of
the camp were disturbing the night with
their jangle and he watched for their
coming. A dark 'spot, growing rapidly,
took form upon the dim white expanse
of ' snow.. It- was . a fore-runner of â¢ the
pack,, leaping cleanly, and, after the wolf
fashion, singing direction to his brothers.
Hitchcock stood In the shadow. As it
sprang . past he -reached out. gripped Its
forelegs In mid-career and sent It whlrl-

came. closer and sniffed, and came yet

Hitchcock,' upreared suddenly, shooting
an. unmittened hand out to the brute's

death in that clutch, and when the man
moved, on. was left broken-necked under
the stars. In this manner Hitchcock made
the chiefs lodge. For long he lay in the
snow without, listening to the voices of
the occupants and striving to locate Slpsu.
Evidently there were many In the tent,
and from the. sounds they were In high
excitement ;
At last he heard the girl's voice and
crawled around so that only the moose
hide divided them. Then burrowing In the
snow, he slowly wormed his' head and
shoulders underneath. When the warm
inner air smote his face he. stopped and
waited, bis legs and. the greater part of
his body, still on the outside. He-could
sea nothing 1 , nor did he dare lift his head.
On one side of him was a skin bale. He
could smell It. though' he: carefully felt to
be certain. On the.;other. side his face
barely, touched a furry garment which he
knew clothed a body. This "must be Slpsu.
Though he wished she would speakÂ»agaln,
Ik resolved to risk it.
He 'could hear the chief and the 'witch
doctor . talking high, and in a far corner
some' hungry child - whimpering to sleep.
Squirming on his side he carefully raised
his head, still Just touching the furry gar
ment : He; listened to -the ; breathing. It
was a woman's breathing; he would

and he was so made that the commercial
aspect of life . of ten seemed meaningless
and bore contradiction to his deeper, im
pulses. - "v
'So he eat silent, with head ( bowed
forward, an orsanlc force greater than
himself as great as his race, at work
within 'him. Wertz and Hawes- looked
askance at him from time to time, a faint
but perceptible trepidation in their man
ner. Slgmund also felt this. Hitchcock
was strong, and his strength had been im
pressed upon them, in the course of many
an event in their precarious life.' So they
.stood in a certain definite awe and curios
ity as to what his/conduct would be when
he moved. to action.
But his ''silence was Ion? and the fire
n|gh out- when Wertz stretched his arms
ana yawned and thought he'd go to bed.
Then Hitchcock stood up his full height
"May God damn your souls to the deep
est, hells, ( you chicken hearted cowards!
I'm done with you!" He said it calmly
enough, Tjut his strength spoke in. every
syllable',- and every intonation was adver
tisement of intention.. "Come on," he'Jcon
tinued, "whack'',up, and in whatevcr^way

camp outfit and mining gear for the dogs.
And I'll throw in my six or seven ounces
and the spare 45-90 with the ammunition.,
What d'ye say?"
The three men- drew apart and con
ferred. When they returned Slgmund
acted as spokesman. "We'll .. whack r'up
fair with you, Hitchcock. In everything
you'll get your quarter share, neither
more nor less, -and* you- can take It*or
leave it But we want the dogs as bad
as you do. so you getfour, and that's
all. If you don't want to take your share
of the outfit and Bear, why, that's your
lopkout. "If you want It you can have it;
if you don't leave It"
"The letter of ' the Â¦ law." Hitchcock
sneered. "But go ahead. I'm w.illing. And
hurry up. I can't get out of this camp
and away from Its vermin any too quick."
The division was effected without fur
ther comment He lashed. his meager be
longings upon one of the sleds, rounded in
his four dogs, and harnessed up. His
portion of outfit and gear he did not
touch, though he threw onto the sled half
a dozen dog harnesses, and challenged
them with his eyes to Interfere. But' they
shrugged their Â¦ shoulders . and Â¦ watched
him disappear In the forest.
A man crawled upon his belly, through
the snow. On every, hand loomed the
moose hide lodges of the camp. Here and
there a miserable dog howled or snarled
abuse upon bis neighbor. â¢ Once ono of
that's all there Is about It It's a way
these people have of doing. It's their re
ligion, and it's no concern of ours. . Our
concern Is to get the dust and then get
out of this God-forsaken land. 'Tlsn't fit
for naucht el?e but beasts. And what
are these black devils but beasts? Be
sides, it'd be damn poor policy."
"That's what I say," chimed in Hawes.
"Here we are, four of us, three hundred
miles from the Yukon or a white face.
And what can we do against half a hun
dred Indians? If we quarrel with them
we have to vamoose; if we fight, we are
wiped out. Further, we've struck pay,
and, by God. I for one am going to stick
by It."
"Ditto here," supplemented Wertz.'
Hitchcock turned Impatiently to ' Slg
mund, who was softly sinking:
"In a yeir. In a year, when" the grar/es are ripe,
I shall etay no more away." . _....-. >
"Well, it's this way, Hitchcock,"- he
finally said. "I'm in the same boat wtfh
the rest. If three-score bucks have made
up their mind to kill, the girl, why, we
can't, help it. One rush and we'd be wiped
off the landscape. And what good'd'that
be? They'd still have the girl. 1 There's no
use in going against the customs of a
people except you're in force." !
"But we are in force!" Hitchcock broke
In. "Four whites are a match 'for a hun
dred times as many reds.' ! And think . of
the girl!" . â¢ v ' "- -. .
Slgmund stroked the dog meditatively.
"But I do think of the girl. And hfer eyes
are blue like summer skies, and laughing
like summer seas, and her hair is yellow,
like mine, and' braided in' ropes 'the size
of a big man's arm. She's waiting for
me out there in the better land. ... And
she's waited long and now my pile's in
sight I'm not going â¢ to throw it away."
"And shamed I would be to look into
the girl's blue eyes and remember. the
black ones- of the girl whose .blood was
on my hands,", Hitchcock sneered; for
he was born to honor and championship,
and to do the thing for the thing's sake,
nor stop to weigh or measure.
Sigmund Bhook his head. "You can't
make me mad, Hitchcock, nor ' do . mad
things because of your madness.- It's a
cold business proposition and a question
of facts. I didn't come to this country
for my health, and further, it's impos
sible for us to raise a hand. If It Is so,
it is too bad for the girl, that's all. It's
a way of her people, and It Just happens
we're on the spot this one time. They's
done the same for a thousand years and
they're going to do it now, and they'll
go on doing it for all time to come. Be
sides, they're not our kind. Nor's the
girl. No, I take my stand with Wertz
and Hawes, and â â "
But the dogs snarled and drew In and
he broke off, listening ' to the crunch,
crunch of many snowshoes. Indian after
Indian stalked Into the firelight, tall and
softly but firmly and felt her start at tho
contact. Again he waited till a question
ing hand slipped down upon bis head and
paused among the curls. The next In
stant a band turned his face gently up
ward and he was gazing into Slpsu's
eyes.
I She was quite collected. Changing her
position casually, she threw an elbow
well over on the skin bale, rested her
body upon it and arranged her parka.
In this way he was completely concealed.
Then and still most casually she reclined
across him, so ti.at he could breathe be
tween her arm and breast, and when she
lowered her head her ear pressed lightly,
against his lips.
"When the time suits, go thou," he
whispered, "out of the lodge and across
the snow, down the wind to the bunch of
Jack pines in the curve of the creek*.
There wilt thou find my dogs and my
Bled, packed for the trail. This night we
go down to the Yukon; and. since we go
fast, lay thou hands upon what dogs
come nigh thee by the scruff of the neck
end drag them to the sled In the curve
of the creek."
Slpsu shook her head in dissent, but her
eyes glistened v.lth gladness and she was
proud that this man had shown toward
her such favor. But she, like tho women
of all her race, was born to obey the will
masculine, and when Hitchcock repeated
"Go!" he did It with authority, and
though she made no answer he knew that
bis will was law.
"And never mind harness for the dogs,"
he added, preparing to go. "I shall wait.
But waste no time. The day chaseth the
night away, nor does it linger for man's
pleasure." f

gingerly in his socks to the firÂ© to thaw
them out. "It's a blessing he's pone," ha
added, "though he was a mighty good

THE singer, dean faced and cneery
eyed, bent over and added water to
a pot of simmering 'beans, and
then, rising, a stick of firewood la
hand, drove back the circling
dogs from the grub box and cooking gear.
He was blue of eye. and his long hair
was golden, and it was a pleasure to
look upon his rusty freshness. A new
â¢ mpon was thrusting a dim horn above
the white line of close packed snow
cepped pinÂ«e which ringed the camp and
segregated It from all the world. Ovei
head. so clear it was and cold, the stars
danced with quick, pulsating movements.
To. the southeast an evanescent greenish
glow heralded the opening revels of the
aurora borealla.
Two men. In the Immediate foreground,
jay- upon the bearskin which was their
bed. â¢ Between the skin and naked snow
was a six-inch layer of pine boughs. The
. blankets were rolled back. For shelter,
there was & Zy at their backsâ a sheet
ef canvas stretched between two trees
and Â»T>sMn.g Â«x forty-fire degrees. This
caught the radiating beat from the fir*
â¢ and flung It down upon the skin. An
other man sat on a sled, drawn close to
the blaze, mending moccasins. To the
right a heap of frozen gravel and & rude
windlass denoted where they tolled each
Cay in dismal groping for the pay streak.
To the left four pairs of snowshoes stood
erect, showing the mode of travel which
obtained when the stamped snow cf the
camp was left behind.
That Schwabian folk song Bounded
strangely pathetic under the cold nortn
Â« era stars, and It did not do the men good
who lounged about the fire after the toll
ef the day. It put a dull ache Into their
hearts and a yearning which was akin
, to belly hung-er, and 6ent their souls
questing southward across the divides to
the* sun lands.

broke off from his song to hurl oaths and

was parted by a fur-clad figure, and an
Indian girl slipped out of the webs, threw
back the hood of her squirrel skin parka,
and stood in their midst. Sigmund and

Her Illusion as to staceland was com
plete; her Interest In it Intense: her ambi
tion In regard to It the strongest impulse
in her impulsive nature.
Daisy Bunton would have been an as
tonished young: woman had she known
that one person was keeping her under
close espionage; that one person had a
fairly accurate list of her matlnee-made
friends, even a notion of a considerable
correspondence she carried on without her
mother's knowledge. But she would have
been more astonished had she known that
thin person was Mrs. John Worthlngton.
Being as stupid as he was proud, the
preat Mr. Worthlngton never learned any
thing, nor gave up an Idea to which he
had once given adherence. This
characteristic was of small Inconvenience
to the men who managed him and his af
fairs, because of the infrequency with
which he originated an Idea. Most of
those Ideas he thought were original with
him were but the .slow growth of sugges
tions planted In Ills mind by the chief
counsel for the Worthington interests,
Caleb Bannister. The latter had a man
ner of treating Mr. Worthlngton as If -he
were a person, not an Institution, and
therefore had more .Influence over , him
than any one else. ;\ But Unfortunately
Mr. Worthlngton was. not wholly an in
stitution; he did ;&4 : rare intervals have

So It was that his. own idea that his eld
est eon should solve the difficulty over
the formation of the Iron combine, by mar
rying the oniy daughter of Isaac Bun
ton." became a fundamental truth in his
mind; an existing, evident fact, to ques
tion which was folly, heresy or madness.
Mrs. Wortfair.glon had never quarreled,
seldom seemed to differ, with her him-.;
Many of these new acquaintances of the
street, were also Westerners, and like
Isaac had come to Xew York with their
families to live. These merry marauders
made up a considerable part of the Bun
tons* social life, and were preferred to
the natives, as seeming to depend less
upon Irrigation and fertilizing than the
native flower of acquaintance. Even
Daisy approved of this element of their
social circle. She met "In It maidens and
young matrons who enjoyed the matinee
with her own degree of enthusiasm; and
when she went to plays In their company,
which she did in preference to going with
her mother, che found no check upon her
growing intimacy with chance acquaint
ances of either sex. These were people
generally associated, or relatedâ vaguelyâ
to people of the stage.

that there was no mystery in Wall street;

the Buccaneers had as many rights and

privateers In those waters,' and proposed
to exercise them.

valuation so fabulous that It was treated
by the /lawver as only another way - of
a grain refusing to sell; and he told Isaao

"your crowd will come to my terms, one

Mr. Worthington was a deliberate man;

will not brook further discussion. I mean,
Bunnlster. that I direct you to draw up

to"
He sank back, his lips moving, but no
sound escaping from them. Bannister
sprang to his side and held him or he
would have slipped to the carpet. Mrs.
Worthington darted to an electric bell
that would have summoned servants. But
she was slopped by the lawyer saying In
a voice of sharp command: "No! j Not a
servant. His condition must not become
known to the publicâ not until the doctor
has been here. Go yourself, quietly, and
telephone for tho doctor. See that no serv
ant ccmes here. Hurry, but" be calm."
When she left the room Bannister, big
and powerful, lifted the unconscious form
and gently laid it on a lounge. Then he
stepped Into the room where a maid was
laying afternoon tea service, asktd for a
glass of water, drank It and asked for an
other. This he walked back with, as if
he had not satisfied his thirst. He quick
ly loosened Worthlncton's scarf 'and col
lar, bathed his temples with water, and
soon was able to give him some of It to
drink. Worthington, staring straight up
at the ceiling, feebly felt for the lawyer's
hand and closed his fingers over It In a
little while he whispered In a low, heavy
voice, "Caleb."
"Yes, John."
"Don't leave."
"No. Don't try to talk."
"Did I fall? Did something strike me?"
He was still staring, . with troubled,
frightened eyes, and spoke so low the
lawyer had to bend close to his lips to
hear.
"You were a little faint. * The doctor
will be here soon."
"Nan?"
"Mrs. Worthington is telephoning.
Bhe'll be here directly."
"Don't leave, Caleb."
"No."
"Friend."
The doctor did not call It apoplexy, but
said something about premonitory symp
toms and ga.ve orders for absolute quiet.
Then he talked with Mr. Bannister, and
told his patient that, as soon as his
yacht could be made ready, he must sail
away on" it for a couple of months, at
least, and avoid even the discussion of
business affairs or of any topic that might
distress him.
"I will obey you," the patient said,
"after I have given "Mr. Bannister one
Instruction.!' Â¦
"If it relates to the subject under dis
cussion when you wereâ overcomeâ I for
bid it," the doctor said.
But he persisted, and told the lawyer
that as soon as the yacht cruise was be

no complaint that his envelope each week
contained a gradually diminishing sum.
He had started their plans In New York
by giving Grace half his earnings, and
when these became smaller he continued
to give her each week seventy-five dol
lars. -
"What shall I do with It ail," she had
said, at first. "If I have it I'm afraid
that I'll spend It all, and that would be
wicked."
"Save it," answered herbrother. "That's
what I propose to do with a lot of my
naif of this boundless wealth."
But they both found a boundary, and
not very far off. Howard's extravagance
was in books. The shops where his be
loved poets were to be found printed on
such piiper ond bound In such leather as
he deemed worthy of them were attrac
tions he could not withstand. And mu

more gratifying use for her good fortune.
It was not easy-At first to find a way to
help the girls she knew were literally

school until they had learned enough of
some kind of decorative work to sup

Howard's advice, and the help of some
of the older students. Grace managed to
nnd a way to help, where pride was
strong and must not be offended. It was
hecauso he knew how Grace was using
much of her allowance and how deep
ly she enjoyed the privilege to do so. that
Howard would not let her know of the
frequent Shrinkage In his earnings. This
was but a temporary trouble, he thought;
there would be more space In v the paper
after the olectlons. He did not at first
avail himself of Proprietor Faulkner's
offer to set things right if ever they
should go wrong, for he disliked to as
sume the role of a complaining workman.
But a change was made In the "make
up" of the page on which his department
was printed, that cut even his reduced
earnings In half. The width of the col
umns on that page were doubled, and the
number of words which had made a col
umn now made but a half a column.
Howard, therefore. In making out his
weekly bill, charged thirty, instead of fif
teen dollars a column. His bill was re
duced one-half by the auditor. He went
to that official and asked an explanation.
"My instructions are that you are to be
paid at tho rate of fifteen dollars a col
umn,"'tne man said shortly.
"But since my arrangement with Mr.
Carson was made, the width of the col
umns on my page has been doubled. It
takes just twice as much of my matter
to fill it."
. "I have no other Instructions than I
have told you."
Howard went to Mr. Carson.
"Well, Paxton, I don't see exactly what
we can do about that," Carson said. "Our
agreement Is fifteen dollars a column,
and a column Is a column."
"And a thousand words are a thousand
words, not . two thousand words," said
Howard.
"Was anything said In our agreement
about a word rate?" Carson asked with
a smile. *"*
Howard, not trusting himself to speak,
turned and left the room of the manag
ing editor, and sought an Interview with
Mr. Faulkner, the proprietor. But then,
and several times later, he was told that
Mr. Faulkner was engaged. So he wrote
to Faulkner, calling his attention to the
fact that his already reduced , pay had
been cut in two and reminding him of
his request .,to : be told If | there was ! any
trouble. In reply Howard received this
letter, signed by Mr. Faulkner's secre
tary;
"I am instructed by Mr. Faulkner to
stale to you thai! it is impossible- for
him personally to attend to the many
minor details of the several departments
of the paper, but that Mr. Carson will
of course abide by any agreement he has
made with any member of the staff."
It took Howard a long time and a great
deal of hard thinking before he realized
what these experiences meant. He had
had so little to do in his life with com
plete rascals that it was like solving a
problem In an unstudied grade of mathe
matics for him to determine the quantity
of villainy he now encountered. The sim
ple and few rules with which his temper
ament equipped him to Judge badness in
man failed to answer this demand, and
he went to Turnbull for help.
"You said one time that Carson was an
honest man and that you knew it, anil he
knew that you knew It. Do you mind tell
ing me now how much of a thief that re
mark implied Carson to be?" he asked
Turnbull one day.
"Did I make that remark to you?"
Turnbull asked, turning his handsome
face toward Howard with Interest, but
no surprise.
"You did."
"Then, of course, I was drunk at the
time."
"You may have been." Howard replied,
deciding that he would be as frank as he
hoped Turnbull would be.
"Have they begun to rob you?" Turn
bull asked, laying down his pen and push-
Ing his chair back from his desk.
"Yes."
Turnbull looked at his Office mate for
some time In silence and then said. "If
you have finished your work let us go
out on the bridge and take a waik. I am
disposed to tell you a storyâ a funny
story."
Tho rush hour on the Brooklyn bridge
hnd not yet begun, and most of the peo
ple on the. promenade, were Idle strollers,
though now and then one was seen who
was plainly trying to steady a wavering
spirit, and with mind fixed by calm de
terminationâor madnessâ take the trou
ble-curing leap over the rail into the
river.* It was mid-October, the still air
was like early June, and the beautiful
sister cities on either' side were radiantly
aglow with sunlight.
"Lovely day," Turnbull remarked, as he
stopped in the arch of the first tower to
light a c!gar. "Too fair a world to leave
while life affords a chance to do a kind
ness to a fellow creature, or continue the
pleasure of the acquaintance of two such
honest men as Faulkner and Carson."
He stopped to glance "at his companion,
but Howard knew the man's moods pretty
well now and patiently waited for him to
come to the story he knew he was deter
mined to tell. Often during the past
months Turnbull had shown a half pur
pose to warn Howard, it seemed, or give
him some advice, but always abandoned
the thought with a cynical shrug; and
now Howard saw that he would speak in
his own time and in his own way, so ho
waited confidently. Turnbull approached
the subject a dozen times, but would turn
from It to call attention to some beauty
of the river or bay or the light clouds
over Sta ten. Island, already beginning to
reflect the fire of the low southerly sun.
At last he put his arm through Howard's
and, walking slowly, said: "I came much
as you did. I had not been copied so
much, was not so well known and was
promised less, but the circum
stances were alike. I was less of
an orange, and sooner squeezed.
They began to rob me; they slowly
killed my capacity for work by a thou
sand petty meannesses, and when I could
not do the work I was employed to do;
when I learned that a man whose name Is
associated with the Chronicle is not
wanted on any other paper; when I saw
that I had no remedy In lawâ for I had
no contractâ I thought with Joy of killing
those two men. . But my, dear old mother,
whose aulet days of peace and rest de
pended upon my work, would have had
no more peace or quiet, if I had indulged
in ; the 'luxury, of killing. So I took the
drudgery work they give even a
squeezed orange; but starve as I might,
and slave as I did, there was the prospect
of my mother starving, too, and It was
"Listen to me, John! Listen to ma a
moment!" cried his wife. "It will break
my heart not to have our first-born go on
with his career. Km, no, hear me. If in
a little timeâ a monthâ I cannot show you
that the woman you have selected for
Jack's wife Is unworthy of him I will
consent to the marriage, will urge it,
"Oh!" he sneered, "that Is a woman's
reason. Is there any reason a man can
understand? Bannister has no objection."
"He has!" the woman cried desperately,
hoping to gain the aid of the lawyer to
her side. â¢
"Indeed? Well, Bannister?"
"I again suggest that we postpone this
subject uritll to-morrow."
"And I Insist that we finish the subject
now," Worthington declared, pounding
the arm of his chair feebly.
"I have no advice to give," the lawyer
said, speaking quietly. "But I make this
suggestion: Let me continue my negotia
tions with Bunton a little longer. We may
find something that will make this mar
riage seem less desirable than It does
now. Your doctor has advised a trip to
the Mediterranean on your yacht. Take
that trip now. In the meantime I will
keep at work with Bunton."
"If any one but you had failed In set
tling the matter with Bunton," Worthing
ton said, "I should hope that it might be
settled. But you have failed. That means
that It is a waste of time to continue on
that line. The delay Is most dangerous.
The opposition to my plan Is Billy. I say
It Is silly! My mind Is finally mads up.
I wish to have Jack Informed, and at
once, of my intention In regard to my
will. If he remains disobedient It Is my
duty to the affairs of the family to put
Rupert at once In touch with the interests
be is to control."
She stopped before she finished the
word, perhaps noting- a signal of warning
In the lawyer's eyes.
Her husband, staring at her with rls'ng;
Indignation, said huskily, "Go on. please."
"I do not deny your right to, make any
change in your will, any departure from
the family custom, for which tLere is a
good reason. If Jack were determined to
marry a woman who was objectionable, I
could sympathize with you; but to say to
him. 'You must marry this one woman,*
Is unreasonable, when it goes without
saying that there are many others as
goodâ betterâ he might marrv. That is
more than an unreasonable limit upon his
choice. It Is an unjust limit."
"The lack of reasonableness, Nan," her
husband said, speaking slowly, though he
seemed to try to hurry his words, "does
not lie with me. You ignore the peculiar
circumstances that make it entirely rea
sonable for me to demand of Jack this
marriage. But what Is all this pother
about?" he cried, a sudden excitement
pivlng him strength to speak quickly and
sharply. "What Is the objection to the
young lady I have selected? Is she not
as desirable as another?"
"No, she Is not!" Mrs. Worthington de
clared, fast losing control or her feelings.
"Why?"
"Her tastes are common!"
Lnjurt! Why unjust? It Is only my
will that makes Jack the princ'pal hatr
and prospective inheritor of my position
as the manager of our interests. Th^ro
is no law compelling me to name our eld
fat son in that relation. As to the jus
tice. Rupert may have a better claim un
der that head than Jack. RuDert surely
resembles me more than Jack, has inher
ited more of mv men'al qualities and
therefore may be sa :d to promise better
at the head cf the family in'er..-Â«ts. when
I am gone, than Jack. Why unjust
Nan?" he demanded, raising his voice.
"Unjust." Fhe replied, struggling not to
let any of the rase she felt show In her
tones, "because Jack has been led all his
life to expect to take the place at the
head of affairs; has been specially edu
cated with that view in mind: because
he is ambitious for that career, and
shows capacity for it: because he hÂ«s
fairly entered urjon that career and is
eagerly pursuing it. so that when he la
in^ full charge he will make the name of
Worthington as much respected and hon
ored as It is now hated or des"
"No, Nan. No. no!" but he leaned on
her arm as he went to a chair, saying, "I
am glad that you are here, Bannister. Â¦ I
wanted to see you. I did not know that
you were in town."
"I did not go to the office," the lawyer
said.
"I know. I lnnulred. I hoped to Â«ea
you. I have had aÂ«talk with Jack. On a
personal matter. But I wished your ad
vice. To give you some instructions,
lather, in the same relation."
He spoÂ«.e with an effort: both physical
and mental, it seemed. His head hung
down, and he appeared unable to lift even
his eyes as he talked.
Mr. Bannister had been nearer than
anyone else to the real human being con
cealed In the shell of lnstitutionaltem en
closing John Worthington. He knew
that such as they were, the soul and
sensibilities which distinguish a human
being from a franchise, or a document of
Incorporation, aspired and throbbed after
a manner within that 6hell; and he had
come, after long years of close associa
tion, to feel a sense-of human sympathy
for themâ a friendly feeling, strangely
tinged with compassion, sprungâ who
knows?â from a consciousness that they
had feebly forced through this bonded,
stocked, syndicated, listed and quoted.
Fhell, and directed toward him. Caleb
Bannister, a living, human sentiment: a
trusting dependence, that makes up In
part the precious "phase of mental dis
position" called affection.
"J think, Worthington," the lawyer said.
'that if you have any business to discuss
we'd better postpone It until to-morrow."
The Great Man shook his head, but not
impatiently, slowly but decisively, and
the lawyer added, "at least until after
dinner. You have been working hard to
day, and look t'red. I'll remain here to
nisht. if Mrs. Worthineton will put me
up."
"I'd like you to remain. Bannister, very
much, but we'll talk now. I'm not 111."
He raised his head with an ' effort. "I
spoke to Jack to-day of my plan for his
marr'age. I wish to sn*Â«ak to you now,
of that: and you. too, Nan." !
"Yes. John: but not now. Let me have
tea served first, and then you lie down
until dinner. Mr. Bannister will stay all
night, and after dinner we can talk when
you are rested," his wife ureed.
They could not move him from his pur
pose to talk then of the idea dearer to
him than nny other he had ever enter
tainedâ h's very own. "J am disposed to
discuss this matter, now." he persisted.
"I wish to speak to you both, for It Is a
matter involving all our Interests: busi
ness and family. I failed. In my inter

"And you. Nan. you understand my de

"I have h^ard what you have said, John
but â it is unjust."
"Because I cannot prove It. Let us oon
â¢14 er the case from Mr. Worthlngton's
viewpoint: Supposing Jack marries Miss
Buntonâ is It certain that he would be
unhappy In the relation? A marriage of
convenience, as you suggested, permits
the husband to seek the society of other
women, for thÂ« recreation his home does
not afford. We have known of such
casrs. you and I, when the world, aware
â¢of the facts, has not been too censorious.
Buch a- marriage would leave Mr. Worth

opportunity to achieve the career you so
earnestly hope for him, and which, I am
fcouhd to say. he shows good signs of
winningâ If he Is given the opportunity."

would not do bo unless you thought me
capable of furthering such a plan. That
â¢ounds like a very hard Judgment upon
me Â«Â« a mother. Mr. Bannister."
Â¦ "Is It unjust?" he asked quietly.
She was eilent for a time and then an

to such a marriageâ urge It If necessaryâ
rather than give up my ambition for my

asks If you are engaged."

When John Worthington entered the
room a moment later they both noticed
his appearance. The lawyer looked at
him keenly, and his wife went toward him
hurriedly, eaying, "Arje you ill, John?"
But he only bowed a grave assent and

and drew on a loose pair of gloves, but
there was nothing In his manner to warn
Carson of the meaning of this, and he
warmed to his subject. "Our society man
tells me that there Is a big story In that

The man of slow wrath was aroused, at
last. Howard's gloved fist shot out. and
Carson staggered back against the door,
and slipped to the floor, his face bleed-
Ing.
Howard, seeing red, sprang at him*
but his . arms were held by Turn
bull, who said quietly, "That's
enough. Paxton, Be quiet, I say! You're
scarred him. That's all you wanted to
do. Not malm him! Not a public scan
dal." Then he whispered. "For your
sister to hear," and Howard ceased to
struggle, and turned away.
"You fool!" Turnbull said to Carson.
"Not* to see what you were bringing on
yourself." He helped him to his feet and
wiped the blood from his cheek.
"You're discharged. Paxton!" Carson
cried. "But that isn't all: I'll have a war
rant against you for this cowardly as
sault!"
"Oh, no, you won't!" Turnbull said.
"Now get out."
Carson left the room, and Howard said:
"Thank you for saving me. I could not
help doing what I did."
"Of course not." Turnbull rÂ»olled_
"Good-by." â¢ '.
He spoke roughly, but Howard made no
reply. "But I'm glad I've found you."
Carson continued. "The chief has or
dered your department work discontinued,
but we've decided to give you a chance on
local stories. Fortunately, I've thought
of a rattling story for you to do."
Howard remained silent, looking at thÂ«
man with contempt, and Carson glanced
from him to Turnbull, a little nervously.
But Turnbull seemed to be writing and
paying no heed to the managing editor.
"I hear from our society reporter" that
you have been a frequent visitor at the
Bannisters."
Howard started a little, and Tumbull
swung round in his chair. "Now, what I
want you to doâ and It will make a big
hit with the chiefâ is to write us a Sun
day page story about that family. Go
Into every detail about their eccentrici
ties."
They went to their workroom, where
Howard gathered his belongings, a few
working books, for he had determined to
quit the office at once. He was starting
for the door with his bundle when Car
son entered. "Paxton, I've sent for you

laughed, for he la clever enough to enjoy
a drunken Joke, and told me so. Yes, be

Bannister hald told me. I got what I

has cost to expose myself to you that you

As Turnbull finished his story, they
reached the Brooklyn pier of the bridge,
and as they turned to walk back his com

they walked on for some time In
silence. Howard spoke first. say-
Ing thoughtfully, "Tell me again,
please, about the money and work you

Turnbull looked up hopefully at the
words, and answered eagerly, "I hold a
whip over the men who. by galling mean
ness and dishonesty, have nearly driven
me to suicide. They have killed somo
men that way. I crack that whip â and I
firmly believe Mr. Eannlster put It Into

"Well, Nora," Howard said, Â«"fflÂ»f bit*
terly as hÂ© saw thÂ© glrl'.i fear. rrÂ«n u
she whispered thÂ© names of Carsoa and*"
Faulkner, "we must not gossip about susa..

"No, sir," she said, "only that's ti-Â«

enough for the rent, and something over

Howard watched her crooked little fljhv
ure hobble down the hall, and then h*>
quietly opened the door and re-entered h!Â».
old workroom. Turnbull was seated at
his desk, his head resting on bis arra>*
as If hÂ© slept, but at the sound of How
ard's step hÂ© said, without looking up,.,
"Come back for something, Paxton?"
"Yes," Howard ar.3wered, laying *> hand
on the other's shoulder. "I've come back
to say that I don't blamÂ© you for uslr<
the Information Mr. Bannister gavo you,
to force these people to let you work, ar-a
to pay for the work you do."
Turnbull raised hla head and nodded
pleasantly, but did not speak. Then How
ard left the oGlce. never to enter It agair?.
He walked briskly and confidently to thj
office of thÂ© Guardian. He had noteu*.
what Turnbull said about no reputable
paper employing a man who had worked
on the utafT of thÂ© Chronicle, but It did? ;
not enter his mind that this rule was
general. He easily understood that sue?
a rule might be Quoted to Turnbull, 'c
save hjs feelings, by a considerate editor
of any paper to whom Turnbull applied"*
for work. When hÂ© was sober Turnbull
did good work and was reliable. BvK
at times, and they were likely to be times
when he was most depended upon, hÂ»
would disappear not only from the office
but from the city, or at least from th'Â©
sight of all who knew hlw. Howard hacj,
more than once sought Turnbull at such
times and taken carÂ© of him. finding him
less difficult to manage than did most
men. This unfortunate falling of th* mart*
was known in all newspaper oCo*# and./
would dose their doors to him, as How**
ard knew; bo he did not apply Turnbull' s
experience in seeking employment to him
self. Â£
With a feeling of elation he had e:*Â»
experienced for weeks, he want to ttts>

to the managing editor. ThÂ© waX- -
ing space for visitor* was sepa
rated from the main editorial rooro
by a rail only, and Howard saw a num
ber of men quietly at work, quitÂ© a dif
ferent class of men from those on th*
Chronicle, working In a very different at
mosphere. Some, whom he had met at >
the club, nodded to him pleasantly,. and '
two or three came to thÂ© rail to speak j
to him.
When he was told that th* managing
editor would see him. he found that gen
tleman. Mr. Prince, seated at a desk in,
the main room. He greeted Howard -i
a way which sent his already refreshed
spirits soaring. "You've not been neigh
borly, Mr. Paxton," Mr. Prino* â¢ said,
pointing to a visitor's chair by th* aid*
of his desk. "Draw up that chairs there's
something I want to *e* yoa about par
ticularly. I'm glad to know you. for you
wrote me a very nice letter from White
River, though your decision wu not
what we hoped for."
"My decision was not based on a yvrr
good knowledge of newspaper offices
here," Howard said.
Mr. Prince looked at Mm sharply tor
an instant, seemed to be relieved at How
ard's confident smile, and continued.
"Let* me explain my especial reason for
wanting to see you, before I forget; n>3
club is to give soon Its annual authcraj
reading night. The committee has asked
me to secure you. There will be no pro
fessional entertainers, you understand,
and you will be the guest of thÂ© club at
dinner, if you will accept our invitation, H
and be asked to read only one or two se
lections of your verses. How does thÂ©
Idea strike you?"
"Very pleasantly," Howard replied,
beaming, "that is, if you think I can -
blunder through my verses acceptably."
"Then that's settled; I'll tell the .com

"That Is what I've comÂ© to speak Jto

Howard saw hla answer before* It waa

came Into Mr. Prince's kindly face, and
ho was silent a moment before ho Said,
lowering his voice, so that It would not
be overheard by others In the roost-:
"Mr. Paxton. I arn sincerely sorry to have
to tell you this; I have not thÂ© power to

There was a touch of pity in his voleÂ©
that was intolerable to Howard and ho'

THE SUNDAY CALL.
. Howard Paxton's position on the, staff
of the Chronicle was not so much altered
during the summer months. Sometimes
a few paragraphs of his comments on
current events were left' out," or somÂ«
verses on which he had done hard work
failed to appear, and his weekly bills
were reduced to the extent of the unused
matter. He never failed to write the tea
10pitilessly for his extravagances. He
would at once give the remaining $500 of
the money In bank to Grace, and before
that was gone he would surely be earning
enough to support her as she bad
been living. Would he? The doubt
chilled his heart! He walked the
streets for . hours, cursing his
stupidity in having made his first step In
New York without advice; questioning,
questioning, how to keep from Grace a
knowledge of this reverse of fortune;
"striving, until his mind became numb, to
fix upon a scheme of ready-selling work
to tide his affairs along until he could
make new connections; torturing himself
with the thought of Grace, her beloved
6tudies abandoned, her pleasant home
given up. struggling with him in pov
erty; sweet-hearted and uncomplaining,
of course, but for that very reason all
the greater reproach to him! He went
to his room and tried to write â anything
âbut Invention was dead. Then he pack
ed his belongings and went out to search
1 for a cheap room to move into, and find
ing one, engaged It but when asked for a
deposit of a week's rent found that the
dollar be had given Nora Day was the
last money he had. "I will call to
morrow." hÂ« said, and walked away.
Mr. Faulkner was Inclined to bÂ« amus
ed at Mr. Carson's story of Paxton's rage
and assault when the angry managing
editor went to the Chief for sympathy.
"But never mind, Carson," he said. "Just
keep Paxton's bills down lower and low
er until he feels the pinch, until he goes
to bed hungry a few times, and then he
won't be so high-spirited about refusing
to do that line of work. The Bannister
story will keep until Paxton's hungry."
"I discharged him." Carson cried tn
alarm.
"Discharged him!" cried the Chief
angrily. "Who told you to discharge'
him? I told you to pull him down until
he was ready to do whatever work 1
wanted him to do. You damned fool!
Don't you know that he's a first-class
special writer? The Sunday editor tells
me he has several times finished stories
that Turnbull left unfinished, and that his
work is rattling good stuff. He's the only
man left on the paper who has any'de
cent social connections in the city, and
we must not lose hhp until he's worn out
those connections. I want that man back!
Do you understand V
"He won't come back." muttered Car
son.
"Why?"
"Turnbull tells me that he was going
anyway, before I discharged him! and
'that he's the kind of man we couldn't
starve Into the work we- wanted of him."
"Bah!" cried the proprietor. "I. could
have done It See that you don't make
another mistake like that, Carson. You're
not the only man. on the paper who wants
the Job you hold now."
Carson slunk out of the presence of the
Chief, glad to get off as lightly as he
did, and the Chief returned to the com
position of an editorial. That work of
his own hand and brain was printed in
the Chronicle the next morning. It
was a passionate appeal for the rights
of the laboring man. It condemned,
scathingly, the heartless employer of
wage-earners who falls to share gener
ously with his workmen the profits of
their toll; pictured the nobleness of labor
la tender and glowing colors; and hinted
that If capital refused to grant the ut
most demand of labor, that refusal was
a Justification for the use of force to
compel compliance.
But the lot of the poor is not always
bs unhappy as the able editorial of Mr.
Faulkner wauld have it appear. The llt
the two-room home of Bessie and Nora
IÂ»ay, and Smiling- Harry, the sea food
man. was not unhappy that- night The
rent was paid and Nora brought home
some meat and tea and bread and butter,
to make such an unusually plentiful meal
that happiness reigned at that family
cupper table, at least
XIVâ IN SOCIETY.
Isaac Bunton's affairs seemed to pros
per; he was an optimist In the stock mar
ket, end, "operating for a rise," as Wall
street phrased it was successful in a
measure th,at gained for him considerable
notoriety. But in the fall of the year,
when Howard Paxton severed his connec
tion with the Chronicle, although there
was a stock market which rejoiced the
"Bulls" generally, there were certain
etocks which Btxanjelv failed to respond
to the common upwanTtendency of prices,
and they were the stocks la which Bun
ton was most interested. His dealings
had been, as usual, based upon a close
Ftudy of conditions, and those conditions
favorably affected many shares, but sel
dom the ones he selected to speculate in.
He was not an unsuspecting "Lamb";
and giving keen attention to a suspicion
that an influence was at work upon the
prices of shares he was known to favor,
he was convinced that his suspicions were
Justified. He knew that there was a pro
cess practiced in the street known as
"shaking out" the holdings of weak or
undesirable operators, but he did not be
lieve, for a time, that the was the opera,
tor aimed at in the depressing Influence
at work on his line of purchases. But
when be made some experimental pur
chases and sales, so openly 'that the
whole street knew of them, they were so
invariably followed by movements in the
prices unfavorable to him that he was
forced to the disquieting conclusion
that he was the marked person. This dis
turbed him greatly. He knew that his
dealings were not of sufficient magnitude
to disturb th* plans of any of the great
powers in the street and his uneasiness
Increased as he sought for a possible mo
tive for these attacks on him. His guilty
conscience answered the question. There
could be but one reason for these as
saults on his finances: to force him to dis
pose of the mining land he had so per
tinently refused to part with.
That subject was seldom out of his
mind, sleeping or waking. A thousand
times he had considered the possibility
of the truth being discovered If he should
take the risk and boldly affix his signa
ture, as owner, to a deed of sale to, the
land. It would end his persecution In the
Btreet; It would at once place him in com
mand of capital to operate on a larger
scale; it would put him in friendly rela
tion with a powerful interest; It would
give him almost an assurance of success
In the field to which his temperament and
ambition led him. But?â his tortured
Imagination invariably dragged him, at
the end of every such thought, to the
scene of the wreck the night he followed
Harry Lawton on the Valley Railroad.
He blamed himself for having made too
ellgbt an investigation of Che charred
and blackened effects found near <Harry*s
body. H* had too readily taken it for
granted that the deed showing that Dr.
Paxton had bought and paid for the min
ing land was In either the coat Harry
wore, or the satchel he carried, and there
for* destroyed. It was possible, he now
thought that Harry might have bought
clothes that required another satchel; the
deed may have been in that and that not
destroyed; the body whose hand clung to
the old satchel identified as Harry's
mlgnt not havÂ« worn an overcoat and
Harry's coat, with tho deed In Its pocket,
might hare been found afterward, scarce-
ly Injured, and be in existence now. Bun
ton recalled some of the mysteries of the
wreckâ a baby taken from a burning car,
asleep, unhuft, its dainty clothing not
even smoke-stained; a half-burned valise
found to contain a bunch of unlgnlttd
matches. Thoughts of these strange
things, all pointing to the possibility of
the deed being 4 still in existence, un
injured, and likely at any time to be dis
covered and come into publicity, racked
his dreams and harassed his waking
hours.
He should have remained at the scene
of the wreck until he had secured the
deed. If it existed, or had proof of its de
struction. Then he would eay to him
eelfâtrying not to say it, but still say
ing it with awful, deliberate calmnessâ
"But you did not intend to conctal the
fact then, did you?" He would not give
himself an answer; but would take up the
possibility of discovery, should he give a.
new, false deed. He would go through a
scene In court, he on the witness stand.
Lawyer Bannister cross-examining him.
He rehearsed answers, even the voice and
look with which he would give them..
Sometimes, for weeks, he would rid his
mind of fear; laugh at the fantastic
Imaginings which had tormented him;
then somethingâ a newspaper story of a
train wreck, with strange escapes; or a
story" of long-lost articles being oddly
foundâ would bring back the whole dismal
flood of doubts and tears, until he won
dered that he could keep from crying out ;
his guilt to the world. During one such
stress of conscience, he made up his mind
that the only escape from bis Intoler
able situation was tne marriage of
Daisy to young Worthington. He Jug
gled with the thought of this plan until
he believed that there would be no sin,
legal or moral, in giving to his own
daughter what he might not. with busi
ness deliberation and intention of profit
eell to another. He clung to. the thought
and hope that there might not be any
necessity for a formal transfer of the
property. Worthington, with his assur
ance that the land was " in the family,"
â¢would go ahead with the iron combine,
and not require that signature to a deed
which would fix a crime on Isaac Bun
ton. Here at last was a way out of his
trouble. He thought of consulting Mr.
Bannister, but shrank from an interview
which might arouse the lawyer's sus
picions. -He would now insist with Daisy
upon which he had as yet only proposed:
her marriage to Jack Worthington. He
spoke to his wife about it. "Carrie," he
said. "I've told you that Mr. Â¦ Worthing
ton favors his son's marriage with Daisy;,
why can't that be brought about 3*'
"Why?" she asked In reply, looking
at him wearily. Her friendless life, her
client sorrow over the loss of her hus
band's companionshipâ his moody ab
straction had killed their companionship
âher unspoken dread about Daisy's will
ful behavior had wrecked her happi
ness. But he did not know. .
"I wonder you ask that, Carrie!" he
said irritably. "Here you are established
In New York society, and happily so.
Through whose Influence? Mrs. Worth
lngton's. Why not fix our place In so
ciety here, beyond any doubt and finally,
through this marriage?"
"Isaac," she said, and in so sad a voice
that he looked at her sharply, and was
annoyed ib see tears in her eyes, "you
are not' deceived about our position,
here?" -
"What do you mean?" he said, his voice
sharpened by sudden suspicion.
"I mean," she said, "that we are not In
society here, "as It Is called. We have
not a friend hereâ I have not You don't
suppose that ail this foolish business of
going to balls and giving them, of going
to dinners and giving them, is having
anything to do with society here? There
la a society here, as there Is in every
community, and a pleasant one, no doubt;
but It is for those born here, those who
have common interests grown up with a
life-long friendship; for those who have
Intimate associations, ambitions, and pur
poses alike. That is what makes so
ciety here, as It does in White Riverâ
anywhereâ there is no difference. We
have nothing to do with thatâ cannot
have. The women I have met -who are
worth knowing give me Just so much
recognition as they are required to by
their husbands, to promote their hus
bands' Interests. There Is not much pre
tense about It. I understand it and they
make no effort to assume that It is oth
erwise. But what have Iâ has any wo
man like meâ to do with the plans, as
sociations, friendships, that make their
real societyâ nothing! The women who
are not worth knowing give me as much
of their time and attention as they de
termine our entertainments to be worth.
There is very little more pretense about
them than the others. Neither class af
fords me or Daisy any society that is
worth the trouble of securing. That is
the place we occupy here; the place every
other stranger equally 'In society* occu
pies, though they may pretend â but never
believe â otherwise."
"Well, I declare, Carrie, you draw a
doleful picture; though It costs enough to
be a better one â to amount to something,"
her husband exclaimed.
"Yes, it .amounts to- something. It
amounts to' this: that I am so lonely, so
friendless thatâ oh, Isaac, can't we go
home? Let us return to White River,
where we arm known and respected for
what we are; where we have real friends
and where your businss does not distract
your mind from everything that used to
make our home happy; where I have In
terests and occupations ' that never, leave
me so lonely that I seem to have lost
both husband and child. Oh, my dear
husband, may we not go home?" she
cried. -
"Carrie, Carrie dear, I didn't know It
was like that Iâ I am very busy, I
know, and affairs are not Just right with
me now; but all that will be straightened
out soon; and then I'll have time to go
around with you and we'll see things and
do things togetherâ I've always meant
that But Carrie, I've not explained all
that I should to you; this marriage will
help me in my. business. Worthington is
the head of a powerful interest here and
with his eon married to Daisy I couldâ
naturally wouldâ go into the iron com
bine under very favorable conditions.
What do you say to that?"
"What can I say, Isaac? Young Worth
ington pays some attention to Daisy, but
no more, I suppose, than he does to many
other girls; no more, certainly, than other
young men pay to Daisy. What do you
wish me to do?"
"Well that is a wonman's business," he
said, taking her hand and patting Itâ and
feeling a knife thrust in his heart seeing
her flush with pleasure at his action.
"You'll be clever about that, as you are
about everything. Can't you bring them
more together? You can't be accused of
fortune hunting, as Daisy will have a
fortune of her own; and youngr Worthlng
ton's father favors the match."
"I'll do what I can. I want to see Daisy
married and settled down. Isaac." she
continued, after a pause, "Daisy's be-'
havior troubles me. She has made ac
quaintances that I don't approve; men
and women she doesn't Invite here and
whom she can tell me nothing about ex
cept that they are 'Jolly people/ who keep
her from being bored to death here. I
don't know how to keep her out of their
company." /
'/By always going -with her, of course,"
her husband replied. *
"If I insist upon that she rebels and
threatens to take her rightful name, Mrs.
Harry Lawton."
Isaac Bunton winced. "Doesn't she for
get that man?", he cried.
"Forget him! She cherishes everything
she has which was once his, -as I would
cherish what had been hers ."If -she were
dead. She loves his* memory â it is the
only thing she does love, I fear," the
mother said with a sigh.
XV-LOVE IS BLIND INDEED.
Another discussion of this proposed mar
riage took place a little time before the
talk between Mr. and Mrs. Bunton. Ca
leb Bannister, in his office in the building
devoted to. the affairs of the, Worthing
ton Interests, sent a clerk to inquire of
Jack Worthington when It would be con
venient for him to see the chief counsel
privately.
In reply to tho message young Mr.
Worthington announced himself.
"I should . have come to you. Jack. In
your father's absence you are the head
here, and you must make us old servants
stand around," the lawyer said.
"I'll let you come to me," Jack replied,
laughing, "when I cease to regard you
as J.he real head here. Is there some
business up to-day?"
"Um. we may decide to call It business.
Anyway, It's private," the' lawyer said,
leading the way to an inner room, where
they were alone. "Jack, you know that
3 our'father has a plan concerning your
marriage." . / .
"Oh", yes!" the young man answered
with a smile, "the haughty beauty from
out of the West"
"Is Miss "Bunton a haughty beauty?"
"She is certainly a beaut>, and looks
haughty. I suppose that does as well as
the real thing. But, Mr. -Bannister, father
didn't speak to me again on that subject
before he started on the cruise, and so I
concluded that he wasn't very serious
about It"
"He did not speak to you again for -the
same reason that we did not tell you the
cause of his Illness.". .â¢
"Mr. BanniBter! You don't mean"â
"I mean that If we had told you the
cause of your father's lflness you would
have gone to him, and that
encounter would have been dangerousâ
as it would have been for him to speak
to you again. Your father considers this
matter very seriously, Jack."
"He told me bo much, sir; but I did not
understandâ Mr. Bannister, what am I to
understand?" \
__ "Your question makes it easy for me to
place the whole situation before you
plainly."
"Which I wish you to d^, sir." He
spoke soberly now, for* he saw that the
lawyer had In truth a serious matter to
lay before him. "What is it, Mr. Ban
nister?"
-"It is this, Jack: your father, for busi
ness reasons which I know you fully un
derstand, for you've had to do with our
efforts to close up that iron affair,. wants
to see Miss Bunton your wife."
"Yes, sir, that I understand. I ex
plained to father my reason for not want-
Ing to try to gal* Miss Bunton's consent
to marry me, If I could do so. What else
is there?"
"What else was there?"
"Nothing. I noticed that father did not
look well, and urged him to go home â
why. it was the very day he was taken
so ill."
"Yes, Jack, It was." Your father talked
the matter over with your: mother and
me when he went homeâ I chanced to be
there. His mind was finally made up
then, and when he recovered he repeated
instructions to me which he had given
before his illness began."
"I assume, from your manner, that
those instructions relate to me."
"They do. Your father has. Instructed
me that, in the event of your noKhaving
offered marriage to Miss Bunton by the
time of bis return, I am to alter his will;
in effect, to provide that Rupert shall
have the control of affairs, after Â¦ your
father's death. Instead of you, and that
you are to be so Informed."
The lawyer made this statement slowly
and distinctly, and apparently with no
more personal interest in the matter than
if it had related to a purchase of one kind
of bonds, rather than another. The young
man was dazed; for a minute he did not
understand the words so calmly spoken.
He was very grave, /when from the con
fused rush of amazement his mind sin
gled out the one big factâ tnat his life's
work, . prospects, ambitions were threat
ened. ' Then he slowly flushed, as he
spoke the first thought that 'came: "Did
my mother approve?"
"There Is no need of my telling you of
your mother's fee line toward you; how
her hopes and ambitions are wrapped up
In your career."
"But, Blr, you do not answer my ques
tion."
"Nor do I Intend to. Jack. It is not my
duty to say one word to influence your
decision, one way or the other. Your
father instructed me to give you this in
formation. I do so."
"You do so as â our lawyer, but you are
more than that to me," the young man
cried Impulsively. "You can't pretend to
be Indifferent to my prospects, you who
have been so good a friend to me since
your own son and I played together.
Why, Mr. Bannister, this Is a terrible, an
unjust condition to put upo.i me. I have
already spent hard years of study and
work, trying to master tho problems the
head of our interests should be familiar
with. You, and our other^ advisers, have
been kind enough to say that I show
promise of succeeding. That has encour
aged me, and urged me on to harder
work, to closer application, to the study
of plans reaching far into the future â
plans that have expanded in many direc
tions (beyond the merely commercial and
industrial limits of our interests, and in
clude many forms of public usefulness
and good, and philanthropy that would
be wise because you have advised meâ
but. all this time there has been no word
that my continuance in this work de
pended on my marrying according to my
father's fancies. Why, Mr. Bannister,
this is trivialâ unworthy, of my father t".
He spoke rapidly and disconnectedly. He
had never before tried to formulate those
things -- plans, opportunities, Ideals,
which made up the seemingly assured
picture of his future. He felt an intense,
sturdy resolve in the big purposes of his
life; purposes which . his nature: would
have formed unaided, but which had been
nourished by the sympathetic ambition of
his mother, and skillfully directed by the
man who now listened to him. "Why,
Mr. Bannister," he continued, after a
pause, as If expecting \ the lawVer to
speak,' "every plan of my lifeâ except one
â is wrapped up in the certainty of taking
up this work for which I have been edu
cated, "and in which "all my hopes and am
bitionsâexcept . oneâ are centered. , But
tha one exception . makes it im
possible for me to agree to my
father's wish." HÂ« paused again, but the
lawyer only bowed, as If to' say that he
was prepared to hear more, If Jack
wanted j* to go on. His attention was
amply paid for. "Do you advise this mar
riage?" the young man abruptly, asked.
_ "I only , advise here on. business."
"It appears that this is to be a busi
ness affair. In that viewâ wiir you ad-.
"Mr." Bannister, Â¦ I expected more friend
liness from you," Jack said warmly. "I
thought you agreed with my . Idealsâany
way, sympathized with my* mother's am
bitions for a greater; wiser use of ' our
fortune. \ Must you be only the lawyer
even to me?" .
The color in Mr. Bannister's face slow
ly deepened a little, but he answered
coolly, "Jack, you have no right to - ask
my, personal views in this matter. I do
not say that I have^ any, but if I had I
should not disclose them, Inasmuch as
your father has a perfect right to give
the Instructions Vas to his will -when 1
have explained to you. The. objections
you have urged here have not been very
reasonableâ not at all so, in truth. >You
protest that It would be unfair to cut
you off from the future on which your
mind and heart, too, set so much store.
Yet you urge no reason why you should
not comply with a'wigh'of your father's
which will assure that future to you."
It puzzled the young man that he was
not understood, but he plunged on: "In-,
sist as you may that you are the lawyer
and nothing else here, I shall consider
you as. something more. You* are the
father of my friend George: you" have
often been my host and seen me in the
company of Miss Gertrude Paxton. I
love her. If I am. so fortunate as to gain
her promise to marry me, I shall con
sider "myself the most fortunate man on
earth. There can be no sacrifice I shall
not cheerfully make, if necessary, to
make her my wife. That is all, I sup
pose, that you require to know, for your
authority to alter my father's will."
The lawyer controlled a desire to con
gratulate the youth who spoke these ro
mantic words, and his heaving calm fea
tures displayed only professional inter
est, and not much- of that, as he -said,:
"No need of anticipating your fate. Jack.
I am not to make the change In the will
until after your father's return. In the
meantime I was only to inform you. The
complexion of affairs may alter. It Is
possible â I "do. not ask for your con
fidenceâthat you may fall to secure Miss
Paxtori's promise. Or have you already
secured it?"
"No, sir," Jack replied, flushing. "I
have nothing butâ hope!" ': -
"The change in the "will would be a
heavy blow to your mother's ambitions,
as well as to yours.".
"To be sure, sir. To take the role Ru
pert was destined forâ and which he
would have been happy Inâ a life of aim
less idleness,' Ib a sacrifice for me. I
would bo more content to start with
nothing but liberty to work; to make a
name; but even that liberty Is ,denled
to Rupert, and will be to me. My father,
for a whim, | deprives . my life of every
purpose, ambition, hope that he can con
trol. But I have . my own, of .which he
cannot deprive me; the hope of winning'
Miss Paxton and the purpose of making
myself worthy of her."
"And If you fall' to win her?" jj
"There." said Jack, smiling, "I. refuse
to consider, failure.. But if you mean to
ask If I have any objections that would
have interfered^Jgifi my father's plans, if
I hod never .;JenoWfc^Mlss Paxton. I as
sure you thatllrhave.no/such objections."
: "Then, 1 ,", said' Mr:'Bannlster, smiling for
the first time, -."your father's plans will be
favored jby Miss^|axtbn's obdurate heart
âIf it is so pecunfrfi as to, remain obdurate
when you : make : your * appeal. " Shall we
leave the matter, In" that": shape?"
"As you,llke,~fsir," Jack said, and went
back to his ownTofflces. , ; ."Â«
A little 'aftesv.4.' o'clock he drove to the
corner of Broadway .' and Twenty-third
street. Leaving his cab there he strolled
west on the street, and had passed Sixth
avenue when he was observed by a young
woman walking toward him, who said in
a tone of surprise that was too great to
be real. "Why, Grace! There is Jack
Worthington strolling this way. Isn't it
funny how often he happens to stroll
along this way. at exactly this hour? I
suppose the shops attract him. What
flower is that in his coat? A little white
chrysanthemum. I've forgot the meaning
of that modest bloom. What is it,! Grace?
Goodness! Don't glare at me as if I'd
done something wicked. Now he's begin
ning to look preoccupied, and see every
mortal girl on the block except you, al
though he saw me miles and miles away."
"Florence Hartley, do stop talking non
sense!" Grace Paxton cried. : ,
"Oh, I'm talking nonsense, am I? In
deed, if my young man-wants to happen
along this way as I come from the school,
I'll thank you not to call it nonsense.' i You
know that Mr. Worthington comes 'to
meet me. for I knew him long before you
did. Now, don't 'blush like .that' You
make me look ridiculous!" ; â¢
"Oh, Florence, do stop, .please, he'll
hear us."
"Do him good," persisted the irrepres
sible Florence. "Now in about three
strides more he'll have the surprise of his
life â he'll discover us."
And in about three strides more Jack
suddenly discovered the* young women,
and managed to look much more sur
prised than the encounter .'. warranted, in
view of the fact that a similar one oc
curred at that place and hour not less
often than three times a week. \
"Oh, Mr. Worthington! You gave me
such a surprise," exclaimed Florence.
"One. so seldom meets any one one knows
this side of Sixth avenue. Were you go
ing down to the ferry, or to see which
way the tide runs in the North River?"
."I'm going to walk back to the avenue
with you, If you'll let me," Jack re
sponded.
"You may." Grace Â»ald. "if you'll prom
ise to do something dreadful to Miss
Hartley." l ;- ;.
"I might buy her some violets. How
would that do?" ;..: ... v
"I'd prefer tea and Jam. if I am to be
consulted about my punishment"
"Oh, could we?" Jack exclaimed de
!!f Â«. d " ' " Tnank you *Â°r the suggestion.
If Miss Paxton admits that you've not
been very bad, I'll make the punishment
tea and violets."
s.'Tve been good," calmiy replied Miss
Hartley, jg "I was pointing out to Miss
Paxton how you always see all the other
girls coming fjom school before you see
us. We are taught to observe closely at
the school, and I call it good to practice
what we're taught"
. ; "Florence. Florence!" exclaimed Grace,
in despair. â¢ "
"Miss Hartley is right," Jack said. "I've
noticed a Â¦' number of the young women
from the school. Is photography a part
of. applied design? Most of them carried
cameras."
"Lunch baskets," .... explained Grace.
"Take the machinery, out of a camera
and the case makes a very good and de
ceptive lunch box. We carry., paper bags.
Miss Hartley and I, not having cameras."
"Nor being proud," added- Florence.
"But how about the lunchroom at the
school?" asked Jack, who was accumu-
latins much Information onjjitf subject"
"Not satisfying," Grace said.
"And -too expensive," Florence amend
ed. "Tomato soupâ always . tomatoâ five
cents: cocoa, five cents, and bread two
cents."
"Expensive," Jack admitted, "and lim
ited." \
"Qh, there's cake once a week!"- Grace
said. "But two hundred and fifty girls,
all hungry, and one cake are out of draw
ing somehow." '
"And, anyway," Florence commented,
"when a fellow has spent five cents for
soupâ always tomatoâ or five cents for
cocoa and two cents for bread a fellow
has gone about as far as a fellow can
afford."
"You are not being a serious fellow,
Miss Hartley." Jack said, looking at her
with a doubtm* smile, "when you say
tnat some of the young women are re
stricted to seven cents' worth of lunch
largely liquid?" /
"Ask Miss Paxton."
"Florence !"â¢ said Grace In a warning
"Oh, bother!" exclaimed plain spoken
Miss Hartley. "What are you frightened
about? Mr. Worthington isn't going to
tell on you. If it were not for Grace
Paxton there would be girls in the school
who would go without even seven cents'
worth of lunchâ without a thing to cook
in their, 'light housekeeping.' without a
room to do that housekeeping in.* There!
I feel better. Mr. Jack Worthington. that
you know at last that such things exist.
It'll do you good to know that there are
honest girls who almost starve to death
trying to fit. themselves to earn' a living."
"It'll do me a lot more good If you"ll
tell me how to help such women. There
arc people in New York who'd feel it a
privilege to help such strugglers. God
knows that weâ that thoseâ whef would
like to give help where it is deserved are
beset by frauds, until we almost despair
of finding the deserving.";
"To be sure," Miss Hartley Bald, "and
if what I said seemed to Imply that you
could do what Miss Paxton ' is doing I
made a stupid speech. Whatever other
means you have, I know that you have
not the means of penetrating their ar
mor of pride. Oh, but they are hard to
help!"
"I suppose,"' remarked Grace thought
fully, "that no one who has not been In
a position where help has been offered
to them can realize the suffer ing such
girls endure even at the thought of be
ing considered objects of assistance. I
don't express myself well; I mean
that It .seems strange to me that
girls I've tried to help won't see
the matter as I do; that they're
doing me a kindness to let me help them,
and .that it makes me suffer when they
let, their pride stand in the way of a priv
ilege. I ask for myself. 1 Do you under
stand 77 she asked, turning to Jack.
"Isn't It falsa pride? I don"t think that
If I were ever to be In. actual need and
any one I believed was sincere wanted to
give me help that I'd decline it It seems
to mÂ« I'd understand." '
She spoke so earnestly and looked so
beautiful as she spoke that Jack felt her
words graven on hia mind. And they
must have been, for he recalled them all
at another Interview with Grace, when it
wrung his bouI to do so. "It seems to
me, rt he said, "that if help is needed and
is offered in the right way by one we care
for It's false pride to refuse It"
"So It seems to me," Grace said. "How
ard has been lovely about this," she con
tinued, i looking up brightly. "He gave
me $500â isn't that lots of moneyâ and told
me to do just what I like with It"
. "Let's . stop talking about things that
scratch one's heart," - suggested Miss
Hartley, "and talk about tea and jam.
If we. don't talk about It Mr. Worthing
ton may forget that he invited us."
"But we can't go," Grace said in an
aside to her friend.
"Oh, yes, we can!" Miss Hartley said
aloud. "I'm six months older than you,
bo I'll be chaperon to you. You are from
the West, where girls go alone any
where, so you ask me along with you and
there you areâ both of us provided against
Mrs. Grundy."
"Come, along," Jack said, laughing.
"Mrs. Grundy permits young ladies to
take tea with me in full afternoon. I've
asked, her."
"That's a fairly good reason for going,"
said Miss Hartley, "but a better one is
that I'm hungry; and besides It Isn t
every day I have a best young man to
show off in the tea rooms."
Miss Hartley was much more amiable
than she pretended to be and walking up
the avenue to the tea rooms she always
lingered longer than her companions
where a window display was to be looked
at; and, after tea, she asked Jack to the
Hartley home, and It was t ever so much
more of a task for her to take off her
wraps than It was for Grace, who was
surprised that she had been talking to
Jack half an hour before Florence came
downstairs. And so. on many afternoons.
After tea some days, while Florence read
in a quiet corner of the Hartley parlor.
Jack and Grace renewed 'their musical
Interests at|d if at times the music lagged
the interest did notâ and Florence read
on. A score of times that bright Novem
berâa hundred, a thousand, ten thousand
times in a single . afternoon â Jack would
wonder if he dared to ask the question
his heart longed to ask; but he would not
risk it until some sign gave him moro
hope. 'Â»â¢'â¢â¢'Â¦'
. And did he see no sign In Grace's eyes?
Love is blind. Indeed.
XVI-A MAN'S FACE IN THE DARK.
For a time. Harry Lawton prospered
and was happy. He was tolerated as. a
character with some privileges In the
district where he first pursued his oc
cupation, as a peddler of sea food. His
popularity with the class of men and
women who 'largely made up the life of
the district late at night assured his Im
munity from police annoyance, for the
police in a way were a part of that class.
Harry's patrons were men and women
the police were paid to shield from the
law, and his association led to a friendly
Intimacy which prompted the police to
grant free to Harry privileges of barter;
something not* Important enough to be
charged for by the police; and, besides,
Harry's trade was not in Itself criminal,
so there was no real reason why tho
police should make him pay for pursuing
Bessie Day was Harry's chief source
of the gossip he peddled with his crabs
and lobsters. Bessie seldom had work,
now. The big playhouses demanded
younger, prefer and sprig-h tiler women
In . the chorus or ballet Bessie had
worked In the best of them, but Illness
had robbed her of most of her attractive
ness, and when ahe did work It was
usually In the poorer houses where
Harry first met her and where the pay
was pitifully small and not very certain.
But in her idle days she haunted the em
ployment'offices where chorus and ballet
were"* engaged and sometimes got short
season work in the back rows of dancers
or singers, where a crowd, or a volume
of sound, was all that the stage manager
sought It was In this manner that Bessie
early heard news which Harry peddled
at night when Bessie had made up his
basks-, of sea food- When Bessie worked,
Nora, her sister, made up Harry*" basket.
This was hard work for Nora, cow that
she was employed, at three dollars a
week, in tha office of the Morning
Chronicle, -addressing envelopes, wherein
were sent throughout the land glowing
pen pictures of the exalted worth of tha
Chronicle as a friend and defend
er - v of. the poor and oppressed.
Often this work kept Nora downtown
until late at night, and she was so tired
when she reached horn* that It was a
struggle to keep awake until the still later
hour when Harry set out; to prepare his
basket, the clean towel to go over the sea
rood, the clean white apron which Harry
must wear and which Nora must wash
and Iron when her poor- back ached and
she could scarcely lift her weak 'hands.
But she did all this, as many women had
done many things for Harry, uncomplain
ingly; and for the same reason â God pity
herâ because she loved him!
But In the district, even in the unwhole
some hours when Harry plaintively cried,
"Sea food! Sea food!" there was a rest
less, a brutal demand, ' for novelty. Ped
dlers of other food, more fancifully
dressed, with Quainter or more musical
cries, came there and bid for Harry's
trade. They .took so much of it that
sometimes Harry cried his wares until
the brightening east foretold the sun and
drove his customers, with other miasmas
of the night, from out the sight of man.
He extended his route to the less popu
lous, side streets, where he sold his food
cheaper and was more often robbed, and
where the police took from him not only
his. stock in trade, If they fancied It. but
demanded small sums of money under
threat of driving him off the streets al
together. Harry knew that It was the
rule of the district, where most of his
customers paid tribute to the "guardians
of the law" for the privilege of defying
the law, so he bowed to the rule of the
fringe, of the district.
But with growing 111 luck, with accumu
lating hardships, with the cold of the
nights biting more savagely through his
thin cfothlng. he always smiledâ "Smiling
Harry!" During the holiday season Har
ry's business languished almost to a van.
ishlng point There were more peddlers
to compete for his trade; his customers
were more prosperous In the easy ex
change of money of the season; so the
sea food man provided only his own un
sold wares at meal times at home. Bessie
was not working, and Nora's wages. If
Mr. Carson had not deducted something
Â¦ from them, were Just enough to pay the
rent. Harry had left the district late one
holiday time night and was crying hts
wares in. a cross street: "Sea food! Sea
food!" -smiling gayly though his voice
trembled with the cold and his frame
shook with weakness. "Sea food! Sea
food!" ho cried, smiling gaily.
"Hey, there, Grlnny!" called a police of
ficer, who stood on a corner, talking Idly
with a thief about a murder that had been
done in the neighborhood within an hour.
Harry obediently stoppedâ he knew
what was wanted-nmd held back the
towel which covered his basket. The- of
ficer selected a crab, which Harry wrap
ped In brown paper, and which the- officer
then slipped Into the capacious skirt
pocket of his uniform overcoat. Harry
covered the basket and started down thÂ»
street. As he did so the thief slipped a
hand under the- towel and drew out a
lobster.
"No, no!" said Harry, "you mustn't
take that."
"Why, you're a lobster yourself," the
thief said, and the officer laughed encour
agement of the witticism. "This Is a
Christmas present from you to me, Orln
"I want it, please," begged Harry. "TvÂ«
a customer for that, and it's the best on*
I have. Please give It back."
"I'll give it to you this way," the- thief
said, and he swung It at him; tho hard,
rough shell cutting Harry's face.
A man none of tha three had noticed.
< but who had paused abruptly a few feet
off. now, with a cry of surprise at the
sound of Harry's voice, sprang at tho
thief, caught him by tho throat and
shook him, as he exclaimed, "You damned
coward!" t
"Take him off!" gasped the thief, "he's
choking me!"
There was a whit* flash of the officer's
club, and the man released his hold on
the thief's throat and sank to tha aide
walk.

The very first trip he made a man in tne
emolflng car asked him where the drink-
Ing* water was. Bullhead, though suffi
ciently gaudy In his new uniform, was
not prepared for any question that might
be .thrown at him. He pulled out his
bo6k. of rules, which he bad been told to
cunsult In case of doubt, and after some
i'v^iy referred his inquirer to the fire
bucket banging at the -front end of the
car. The passenger happened to be a
foreigner and very thirsty. He climbed up
on the Baker beater, according to direc
tions, and did at some risk get hold of the
bucketr-but It was empty.
"Iss no vater bier," cried the second-
what the excitement was. By the time he
had decided what rule covered the emer

half way through the eating-house east
of the depot. Kenyon, after hearing Bull
head's own candid statement of fact,
coughed apologetically and said three
years; whereupon Bullhead resigned per
manently from thÂ« train and ap
plied for a Job in the roundhouse.
But the roundhouseâ for a boy like Bull
head. It would hardly do. He was put
at helping Pete Beezer, the boiler washer.
One night Pete was snatching his custo

away from Bullhead and struck his boss.
In the confusion Peter, who was nearly

About the same time he became Inter

dence chnwerf Callahan his star. It was
the best thing that ever happened, for
the assistant head of the division had an
Impulsive way of swearing the nonsense
out of the boy's head, and when Bull
head confessed to being a detective a fiery
stream was poured on him. The foolish
ness couldn't quite all be driven out In
one round: but Jamie Lyons went to
Goose River fairly well Informed as to
how much of a fool he was. ,
Goose River Junction is not a lively
place. It has been claimed that even the
buzzards at Gooa* River Junction j play
solitaire. But apart from the utter loneli
ness tt ' was hard to hold operators there
on account of Nellie Cassldy. A man
rarely stayed at Goose. River past the
second pay check. When hÂ« got money
enough to resign he resigned; and all be
cause Nellie Cassldy despised operators.
The â¢lunch- counter : that Matt Cassldy,
Nellie's father, ran at : the Junction 'was
Just' an adjunct â¢ for feeding train crews
and > the J few miners . who wandered' down
from Â£ the 'Glencoe: spur.) Matt -himself

like the sugar she began to sprinkle in
his coffee. That was what she wanted;
when he was fairly dissolved, Nellie, Ilk*
the coffee, went gradually cold. Bullhead
became miserable, and to her life at
Goose River' was one* more endurable.
It was then that Bullhead began to
sit up all day, after working all night, to
get a single smile from the direction of
the pie rack. He hung, utterly miserable,
around the lunchroom all day, while Nel
lie made Â¦ Impersonal remarks about the
colorless life of a mere operator as com

and ruining himself on fermented syrup.
On a certain night, windier *Mn all the
November nights that had gone before,
the night operator sat alone In the office
facing a resolve. Goose River had become
Intolerable. Medicine . Bend was not to be

"All right," she said.
"Good! We'll begin by going boating
to-morrow."
"Perhaps," she remarked quietly, and
walked Into the hotel.
She met him at the wharf the next even-

arms bared and the smoke from his cigar
floating behind them In imitation of that
which had drifted from the steamer fun

Through July and into August the les
sons continued. He took her driving,
sailing, walking along the strand. She
began to feel quite as though they were
In earnest, and grew a little Jealous of
the friend whom he devoted an hour - a
day and two quires of paper a week; The
other people gossiped, as people will who
have nothing better to do, and ' they
laughed at the gossip. At last he pulled
her out of the surf one afternoon when
she had been caught by the undertow. .

"The- season begins soon," said he.

"I have had a Jolly time," he admitted.
"And It ends to-morrow."
"To-morrow."
She paused, scanning - the horizon for
the steamer, which was long overdue.
But there was no motion anywhere-ex

"We shall be going on the road again,"
the man remarked, "to stuffy theaters

the girl. Â£p'Â»v.
And then, as he leaned against his chair
and took to puffing placidly, she rose
to ( go. , , .

ON the first night but one of their
mutual vacation they sat on the
porch of an ocean hotel and
watched the sea climb over the
sands at their feet. The last of
the other loiterers had exchanged the
view for the delights of dressing gown
end slippers some ten minutes before,
leaving to them the wide veranda and
an argument begun an hour earlier. A
mile away a small steamer forged on
ward; it* trail of smoke lay drowsily
on the water like a black monster
stretching Itself for a long rest.
"It's ridiculous!" he remarked, staring
reflectively at the lighted tip of a fresh
cigar.
"Well.- she replied, "we find it true of
writers. Nearly every novel is a multiple
picture of the novelist. Why should we
expect a piayer to portray emotions be

"You would make It. necessary for all

Lady Macbeth must have planned mur-'

be at once an educated and a successful
woman."
That is a trifle radical." she urged.
And, as her opponent did not attm to
feel that she had recovered her lost
ground, she added: "I mean merely

time or other have been conscious of the

"Yet we seem to get along."
"No." Ehe answered, thoughtfully, "I

"Yes," she admitted. A man and a
woman somewhere on the beacb were

brought the words to their ears. She
paused an Instant to listen. Finally she
continued: "Neither of us has donÂ« so

vaguest way at some sentimental pas
sage, and many of them may have been
epoken in a fashion that lacked the true
ring. All this might be remedied if I had
ever been In love."
"Why don't you experiment?" the man
queried facetiously.
"Because. I have no one with whom to
experiment. I couldn't very well fall In
love with myself." " Â¦
"It has been done."
The girl laughed and' roÂ»Â« to go. A

was no longer comfortable.
"Hold on!" he said. "I'll be a subject."

AT vSISCON.SE.TT POINT-
âBy Anna iS. Richardson
A Dresden (German) physician, having
addressed a list of thirty-six questions
to seventy-three persons who were more
than 90 years old. learned, among other
things, that all of them are below the
average height; most of them have light
hair and have retained plenty of It. and
none of them has any teeth remaining; all
take kindly to the bath or to fresh air.
There were no rules to consult then. No
vay on earth of getting into the office
in time to do anything: to drag himself
to the lunchroom, twice further than the
station, was out of the question. But
there was a way to reach his key in spite
of all bad thing*, and Bullhead knew the
way. He struggled fast around to the
window.' Raising himself with a frightful
twinge on one knee,. he beat at the glass
with his fist. Clutching tha sash, he drew
himself up with a- hand, and with the
other tore away the bunting, stuck his
head and shoulders through the opening,
got his hand on the key and called the
can on for help: he Just stuck, to the
crawl, grinding his teeth in bitter self
reproach. They traced him, next morning,
when he was past the telling of it, and
his struggle looked the track of a wound
ed bear. Dragging along one crushed leg
and half crazed by the crack on hla fore
heed, Bullhead climbed to the platform,
across, and dragged himself to the door.
He can tell yet about rolling his broken
leg under him and raising himself to grasp
the thumb-latch. Not until he tried to
open it did he remember it was a spring
â¢ock and that he was outside. He felt In
his pocket for his keysâ but his keys were
gone.
The pilot bar of the short line mogul. In
swiping Bullhead unmercifully, had really
made a railroad man out of him. It had
let a great light In on the situation.
Whereas before every one else on the line
"And Bullhead!" cried everybody.
"That's what gets me. Who'd have
thought It of Bullhead!"
When they all got up there and saw
what Bullhead had done everybody agreed
that nobody but Bullhead could have
done it.
Somebody said suicide: but Mat Mullen
suddenly stuck his lamp out of the broken
window, put his head through after It,
and cried out. Setting his lantern down
on the platform, he crawled through the
broken sash and picked up Bullhead.
Next morning it was all over the West
End.
After No. 80 had passed so Impudently
No. 1 felt her way rather cautiously to
Goose River, because the dispatchers
couldn't get the blamed station. They de
cided, of course, that Bullhead was asleep,
and fixed everything at the Wlckiux> to
send a new man up there on Three in the
morning and fire him for. good.
But about 1 o'clock No. 1 rolled bad
tempered into Goose River Junction, and
Bat Mullen, stopping his train, strode
angrily to the station. It was dark as a
pocket Inside. Bat smashed in the door
with his heel and the trainmen swarmed
in and began looking with their lanterns
for the nightman. The stove was red
hot, but he was not asleep In the arm
chair nor napping under the counter on
the supplies. They turned to his table
and discovered the broken window and
thought of a hold-up. They saw where
the nightman had spilled something that
looked like ink over the table, over the
order book, over the clip, and there was
a hand print that looked inky on an open
letter addressed to the superintendentâ
and a little pool of something like ink
under the key.
Besides, what need has a young man
with a heavy crescent-shaped scar on his
forehead that people Inquire about and
who within a year after the Goose River
affair was made a train dispatcher under
Barnes Tracy at Medicine Bendâ what
need has he of a coquette's smiles? His
mother, who has honorably retired from
hard work, says half the girls at the
Bend are after htm, and hla mother ought
to know, for she keeps house for him.
Bullhead's letter of resignation, with the
print of his hand on . It, hangs framed
over Callahan's desk, and Is shown to
railroad big fellows who are accorded the
courtesies of the Wickiup. But when they
ask Bullhead about It he Just laughs and
says some railroad men have to have
sense pounded Into them.

He was a reputable citizen and I could
conjecture no cause for his removal. I
went to the, Postoffice Department and
the First Assistant Postmaster General
Informed - me that tha Auditor of the
Treasury had requested and recommend

said ' he, pompously producing from his
portfolio a letter, which he handed to tha
First Assistant. "That, gentlemen; read

He was at his beat at a dinner table,
where he was the prince of ' raconteurs.

While a member, of the Forty-first Con

a good fellow, but he' was not thrifty and
he would buy anything that was offered
Mmâ on credit. If he happened to have
the money he would pay, but he gener

purchased a meerschaum pipe for $7 from
a tobacconist named Packsher, who kept

creditors who darkened the halls and pas

Mondays, and just as often did he receive
the usual request, "Call n gain." Growing
weary of this constant procession of

Campbell, one Monday morning arrayed
"himself behind a long table covered with
documents and on the next visit of Pack

If Mark Twain had turned his attention
to serious rather than to humorous liter
ature hÂ« would, in my opinion, have
achieved as great a success. His book,
"The Prince and tha-Pauper," is as accu
rate and as interesting an historical novel
as any written by Sir Walter Scott. Mark
must have made a close and careful
study of tha laws, customs and lifu of
England during tha reign of Henry VIII,
and tha idea of a ruler who went to
school to his own laws la as original as it
la alluringly presented.

and was compelled to consume the ears
of a spaniel and drumsticks of a bulldog

Mrs. Fitch presented the third chapter,
describing the home life and education,
culture and thought of a beautiful Ver
mont girl, who was compelled by her
father's loss of fortune and death to come
to the Pacific Coast and seek employment
as a teacher. '
Mark Twain was to write the fourth
chapter, but the day before it was to ap
pear the Occidental suspended and his
part of the book was forever lost to the
world. When questioned with regard to
it he answered: "I should have kept the
compact, but I intended to place that Ver
mont girl in a situation that she would
have found difficult to explain to the sat
isfaction of her friends. I had her dealing

stopped before my turn came, but you
couldn't expect that kind of a paper to be

And Crookneck said on a later day that he stood till he was lame.
Under a beautiful bamboo tree the wedding feast was spread.
And Water Melon ate so much that he was almost dead.
Stewed grass with scalloped leaves and daisies a la mode
Were served in great abundance while wine of. dewdrops flowed.
Salad made of buttercups and milkweed sherbet rare
Were liberally handed out to all who were lucky enough to be there.
After the health of the King was drunk, and also the health of the Queen,
The hosts of subjects loyal and true made merry on the' green.
Policeman Pat Potato had but little time to play, f "
For his duty was to guard the gifts that came on that glad day.
One of the costliest things received was a handsome soup tureen,
And another was a beautiful lamp with a shade of mellow greea.
There were laces and embroideries and forks and spoons and knives
And a thousand other things the pair could keep throughout their lives.
80 many were the handshakes that the King, in some alarm.
Bade the subjects go their ways and let him rest his arm.
The beautiful Queen with graciousness poised her lips to all who came, .
But drew the line on Onion oldâ and for that no one could blame.
The sovereign and bis consort, by the light of the silvery moon.
Slipped away from the palace royal and went on their honeymoon.
They were absent many days, my sweets, and many a place they saw,
And the pair could do much as they liked, for the monarch's word was law.
The joy that reigned when they came back was great and unconfined,
And the 13ng, to show his gratitude, was very good and kind.
He created knights and barons and dukes and counts and squires
And ho kept the sir aglow for weeks with red and yellow fires.
One night the wizard Qrandpa Prone dreamed that far away
Were lands o'er which tbq monarch could extend his wondrous sway.
He told the Kfaff whet he had Man in vision plain and bright,
And the sovereign slapped him on the back and said he must be right.

At a word from General Pippin, who was Master of the Day,
The bridal party started with flags and banners gay.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
. Mr. Hutchinson, from his prominence in
political circles in Southern California,
has a host of friends in this part of the
State who will be pleasantly surprised by
this unexpected breaking of the bonds of
bachelorhood by one of its strongest mem
bers.
Miss Ludlow is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Manford Ludlow, a well-to-do family
of Hanford. She is a sweet singer, who
has often appeared before Los Angeles
audiences in the past and it is not strange
that her love of music should have been
the means of meeting between her and
her fiance. In 1898 Mr. Hutchinson visited
Hanford in connection with a political
meeting and noticed the young lady, who
sang with such an easy grace before the
large assemblage of men. She had been
kept until ' very late by the lengthy
speeches, but awaited her part with no
shqw : of- impatience . and when her turn
came graciously answered to an encore.
Mr. Hutchinson was interested and con
sidered it an outrage to have kept that
girl there, compelled to listen to those
long, dry speeches, and he proceeded to
and out who she was.
Later Miss Ludlow received a note of
apology from Mr. Hutchison for the long
speeches which had kept her waiting. He
Burely would have been fined had his
bachelor brothers known about any such
overstepping of - their vows, but Cupid
works best in the dark and has a fond
ness for sealed epistles. A correspond
ence ensued and a year, later the wily
manipulator, sometimes â¢ailed Fate or
Cupid, arranged a meeting in 1S99 at the
Curtner Seminary, Irvlngton. Miss Lud

Bachelors' Club saw much of each other,
both in Los Angeles and in Hanford, and

known men at the local bar, is to
be married on October 15 to Miss Maud
Ludlow of Hanford. Kings County. It
may seem an inconsistency, but when one
has seen the charming bride-to-be it al
most seems that the penalty should not
be demanded by the club for "such an in
excusable indiscretion" of a supposed-to
be confirmed "bach."

The Government deposits were reduced

A SOCIAL CHAT
NEW YORK. Oct. 3.â The arrival of
over a â¢ million dollars in gold at San
Francisco from Australia and ita transfer
through the treasury to New York
| had a~.- timely effect upon the money
market. The lateness of the corn ami
spring: wheat crops still deters the move
ment of currency to the West. Some hopo
is Indulged in that the deposit of Gov
ernment funds with Western banks may
lighten the pressure upon New York and
that the reflux of funds from the cotton
region may set in in time to help meet
the Western demand, i \ .
Â¦ The ' stock market to-day was narrow
and dull and largely confined to profes
sional operations. The movement was de
cidedly irregular, especially at the close,
when some of the leadlirg stocks ran up
to the top level of the day, notably St.
Paul and New York Central, while others
ran off to the lowest, Erie and Missouri
Pacific being conspicuous. The tone was
somewhat unsettled throughout. London's
influence caused the opening decline and
an effective rally was lost on 'the appear
ance of the bank statement. - {.'
The market rallied well and closed Ir
regular, as above indicated. There was
evidence of some left over liquidation and
the outcome of the Baltimore banking
embarrassments was still a small disturb
ing factor on sentiment. Sterling ex
change was easy, and discount rates de
clined in London with reports of large
arrivals of gold from South Africa. New
York's probable coming requirements
upon London for srold thus promise to
be facilitated. There are signs of con
tinuance of arbitrage operations by the
underwriting syndicate by buying United
States preferred and selling the bonds. /
There has been a considerable improve
ment in sentiment in Wall street during
the week as a result of various causes,
but principally the lightening of,the pres
sure of unexplained liquidation which had
been going on for a considerable time and
followed with an urgency and a disre
gard of prices which stamped it unmis
takably as necessitous. Selling of this
character was still in evidence on Mon
day and made the closing of the market
on that day weak to the point of demor
alization. The next day showed a sud
den and unexplained reversal in the
course of prices. It became very evident
in the course of the day that the strong
est banks and capitalists were buying
stocks at various points in the list for
the purpose of supporting prices and
soothing the fears which were threaten
ing to run into panic.
On Wednesday again there was abun
dant evidence that stocks which had been
bought the day before to support the
market .were being sold again and there
were signs of a recurrence of liquidation
which caused the clouds of Bloom to
gather about the Stock Exchange again.
But when this reselling was accomplished
the market took on a more normal ap
pearance of strength and seemed compar
atively free from forced liquidation. . Cou
pled with the uninterrupted fall in the
United States Steel securities the sur
mise waa formed that the. financial trou
ble centered about the' iron and steel in
dustry.. The closing of various mills and
the admitted necessity for. curtailment of
the.pigiron output. gave additional force
to those, surmises and gave rise to an
apprehension that a coming, industrial
depression and an economic crisis was be
ing foreshadowed by the continued de
pression in the securities market.

For a number of years the Republican
politicians have been at war among them
selves. This has become so bitter that at
times the interests of the Republican
party were in Jeopardy. A short time
ago Harry Edwards conceived the idea
of uniting these warring factions in the
Union League Club, and from the way
all the politicians are flocking into the
organization there promises to be a gen
eral burying of hatchets this summer.
At last night's meeting steps were taken
looking toward the establishment of club
rooms. As soon as 200 members can be
10un4 who are willing to pay 6Q cents a
month headquarters will be opened.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 3.â ThÂ© Union League
Club, the new harmony organization of

now has a membership of about 400 and
is growing fast.' At a meeting last night
seventy-five new members were added to
the list. Under the direction of President
H. J. Edwards and Secretary Fayetto
Mitcheltree, an energetic campaign is be
ing conducted throughout the county. Al
ready in its membership are included
prominent Republicans from all over the
county from Palo Alto to tJilroy. â¢
The organization proposes to harmonize
all the warrlne factions of the Repub
lican party in Santa Clara County. In a
circular being sent out the purposes of
the Union League Club are declared to
be as follows: *
The members of this organisation, believing
earnestly in the principles of the Republican
party and that the best Interests of our coun
try demand the application of those principles
to the conduct of public affairs, locally as
well as in the nation at large, have Instituted
the organization to support and inculcate those
principles; to promote, encourage and sustain
absolute and unqualified loyalty to the Gov
ernment of the United States; to further, and
by social, moral and political Influence, assist
in advancing the cause of good and wise gov
ernment and the honest and patriotic admin
istration thereof; to aid, by the same means
in preserving the political equality of all men
before the law; to aid in eliminating from
our party politics the evils of so-called boeslsm
and to procure the nomination and election
of honest and capable men; to promote har
mony within the party; to persistently and
continuously strive by every means to stim
ulate and strengthen Republican sentiment
among all classes of people. -

Chamberlain holds that the consoling
theory that other countries are ruining
themselves by bounties and import du
ties hardly coincides with the fact that
British exports have been practically sta
tionary for twelve years, while those of
other countries have increased so rap
idly that "if the relative progress contin
ues for a few years longer they will have
left us far behind."
Continuing Chamberlain points out that
the property of the working classes has
increased in greater proportion in the
protected countries than in the United
Kingdom, and says:
Free trade. If It had ever existed, might
have secured for us all that Its
promised, but free imports without free trade
have brought us face to face with problems
which never entered Into Cobden's calcula
tions. AVe know that the Idea of a united em
tire did not appeal to Mm, and that he re
garded the colonies as an encumbrance to b<3
got rid of ae soon as possible. The little Eng
landers who follow his lead are not likely to
t>e moved by eny consideration arisinjj out of
our new found pride and faith In our distant
kinsmen. But' what would Cobden have said
if he had foreseen that the trades unions,
whose existence he deprecated, would be suc
cessful in protecting labor in a score of ways,
tending to increase the rate of wages and to
raise the etandard of living? Would Cobden.
&s the representative of the manufacturing
ciars. have still maintained that while the.
manufacturer was artificially prevented from
ordering labor at the lowest rate, he ought to
icst content when the products of foreign la
bor, untrammeled by any regulations and leg
islation, to which he has to submit, under
sell him in his own market? -Cobden' a scheme
was at least consistent. It was free labor as
veil as free imports; but free Imports, com
binÂ«-d with protected labor, is neither consist
ent nor profitable to any of the parties con
cerned.
Chamberlain does not mince matters.
With aggression he carries the war into
the enemy's camp.
â¢Those who maintain," he writes, "in
a Fpirit of blind obscurantism, the abso
lute Inspiration of an lntiquated doctrine
will have much to explain."
Ills remarks are addressed to union
men of all political opinions, since the
questions now raised are not neceesarily
matters of party politics, nor indeed is
It likely that the issues will be ultimately
decided on strictly party lines. He begins
by Eaying:
It is difficult to believe that the results of
tho investigation will not convince every Im
partial man of the necessity for some recon
struction of the system which has remained
stationary and unaltered for more than half a
century while every other policy has been
modified and adapted to meet modern require
ments.
LONDON, Oct. 3.â "Every other nation
end all our own self-governing colonies
have refused to accept the gospel of Cob
den, and yet, although they ought, ac
cording to lta dogmas, to be in the last
atage of depression and decline, they
have grown during the last twenty years
In wealth, population and trade and in
everything that goes to make up the
greatness of a nation."
That Is the keynote of Joseph Chamber
lain'* manifesto, which will bo published
October 5 in the form of a preface to a
chilling pamphlet, entitled "Mr. Chamber
lain's Proposals: "What They Can and
What We Shall Gain by Them," by C. A.
Vlnce, secretary to Chamberlain's tariff
organization. In view of the vigor with
which the war of pamphleteers has again
come in vogue in English politics, the
publisher has appropriately given Cham
berlain's pronouncement deep red cov
ers, in significant contrast with tho un
decided blue-gray of Premier Balfour's
academic treatise on the financial ques
tion.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 3.â Miss Eva
Goldey, a popular : young woman of this
city, attempted to commit suicide this
evening about 10 o'clock by swallowing
the contents of an ounce bottle of car-'
bollc acid.
The young woman left her lover, Claude
Ream, at Tenth and Â¦ K streets, walked
up near the cathedral on Eleventh and K
and swallowed the poison. She was seen
to reel by two pedestrians, who ran to
her assistance. They carried her to the
Capital City Wheelmen's Club, where Dr.
Hanna was called. She was afterward
removed to the Receiving Hospital, where
everything was done to save her life, and
at this writing Dr. Hanna said she had a
slight chance for recovery.
The young- woman lived with A. S. But
ler, her Btepfather, at Twenty-fourth and
N streets. Her mother and stepfather
were called to the cot of the Buffering
girl, and in her excited condition the
mother said that false publications wera
thÂ£ cause of the attempted suicide.
Claude Ream, the lover, uvas inter
viewed by a Call reporter ana, although
he would say but little about the case,
stated that a private detective named
McTurnan called upon Miss Goldey this
afternoon and agitated her to, a nervous

CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE.
The meeting adjourned with three great
cheers for Henry J. Crocker and the en
tire ReDublican ticket.
This U a business meeting to arrange for a
meeting of business men next Monday nljfht,
ana I will not take much of your time. It
has been remarked that we have been * littlo
alow in our campaign work. It Is b. tier to
go a little slow at first and be aure than to
do the rush aot. Active workers have been
aevlsingr ways and means of effective organi
zation. It will be ehown. when we open
the campaign, that all Interests have been
invited to Join in the work. Broader plans
than those first suggested have been adopted.
The meeting Monday night may be one of the
strongest indorsements or the campaign. It
may lead to wider efforts. V.
The idea of a business administration of
tha affairs of San Francisco Is gaining ap
proval and popularity. I have been a worker
In the ranks of the Republican party through
many campaigns. This is my first experience
as a leader. I propose to give my time and
energies to the work before us. Julius Kahn
will head my campaign. He will be rein
forced by a strong campaign committee, a
capable executive committee and a strong
finance committee. "We have an effective or
ganization. Wo believe that the Republican
party can render San Francisco a great and
enduring service. We believo it to be the duty
of business men. property owners and all oth
ers who are closely identified with the wel
fare of Sen Francisco to stand together now
and give to the people of the city the benefits
of a clean, progressive business administra
tion of municipal affairs. I comprehend the
extent of my individual responsibility in this
campaign. I speak of myself because I know
what is up to me. as your candidate for
Mayor. As I say. this leadership Is new to
me as I have always worked in the ranks
of the party, but I am going right along the
line for thÂ« succers of the .Republican ticket
and the prosperity of San Francisco. If Henry
J Crocker is not elected Mayor It will be be
cause the wrong man was nominated to lead
the party. I know It is up to me to make
a winning fight and I do not propose to lose
any time in getting down to the hard work
of tha campaign. Let us make Monday
night's meeting a demonstration on the part
of the business men of the city.
On motion of E. R. Lilllenthal a secre
tary and assistant secretary were engaged
to oj>en the rolls of the Crocker Club
and obtain signatures.
Julius Kahn asked Henry J. Crocker to
eay a few words. The suggestion evoked
hearty applause. Mr. Crocker, in sub
stance said:
Major J. L. Tharp, Colonel Robert
Welncke, E. R. Liljienthal and Thomas
Brown also spoke briefly.
HBNB.Y J. CROCKER SPEAKS.
A. H. Vail said: "There is no doubt In
my mind as to Mr. Crocker's election, but
we should srct our workers In. the field
at once. Every business man should at
tend the meetine Monday night and pre
pare for active work."
that the labor vote was divided between
Schmitz and Lane.
James McXab maintained that -a busi
ness man of intelligence and energy
should be placed at the head of affairs in
San Francisco. Mr. Crocker was entitled
to the loyal and active support of every
Republican. Reference was made to
Lane's inexperience and lack of business
ability. Mr. McNab is confident that
Henry J. Crocker will be elected Mayor.

The Only Remedy in the "World Ex-

Will Certainly Cure Any
Form of Files.
* .; Â¦/ -â¢Â¦.Â¦-â¢.
The study of physicians, the experiments of
chemists, the loudly advertised pretensions of
quacks, have been for years expended in one
direction; to find a pile, cure that would cure.
The results have been a number of harmless
and In most cases useless ointments, supposi-
tories and even Internal remedies, which the
publio have weighed in the balance of expe-
rience and found -wanting; nearly all of then*
gave eome relief, but nothing approaching a
radical cure resulted from these preparations.
The remedy required Is one which -will Im-
mediately etop the patn so severe In many
cases of piles, and then by contracting the
email blood vessels (capillaries) to their nor-
mal size, produces a radical cure by reducing
and finally absorbing the tumors and healing
the Inflamed, raw mucous surfaces.
Until a few years ago no such remedy had
been produced, but at that time a suppository
was placed upon the nUrket, which has since
proven Itself to be the long sought permanent
cure for this common and distressing trouble;
it haÂ» rapidly become famous throughout the
United States and Canada, and Is now sold
by ail druggists under the name of Pyramid
Pile Cure.
It is now the best known, because lta merit
and eafety have advertised it wherever used.
It has bÂ»en advertised by word of mouth, from
one sufferer to another; people who have tried
everything tlse. even submitting to painful and
dangerous eurgical operations without avail,
have finally found that piles can be cured
without pain and without expense practically,
as the Pyramid Pile Cure Is sold for the nom-
inal price of 60 cents and $1.00 per package.
The Pyramid Instantly stops all pain and
at the same time contains no cocaine, morphine
or narcotics; the acids and healing properties
contained In the remedy speedily remove,
rauxe'a health! ul, natural contraction and ab-
sorption of the tumors, it will cure any form
of rectal trouble except cancer and advanced
fistula, which, by the way nearly always re-
sults from neglecting proper and timely treat-
ment for plles.-

FRESNO, Oct. 3.â A message from
Crane Valley received here to-day by For
est Superintendent C. . S. Newhall states
that 10,000 trespassing sheep have been
caught in the reserve in the neighborhood
of Beasore Meadows by a large force of
rangers. The sheep cams In from the
east side of the range and down toward
the Meadows from the Yosemlto country.
Since the recent decisions by the courts
relative to trespassing stock the instruc
tions to the rangers have been very ex
plicit, and a large force has been em
ployed, with orders to take charge of,
drive out and scatter all .sheep caught
within the reserve. In view of the wide
spread publicity given to the laws the
presence of the sheep in the reserve Is
deemed a willful trespass.
The sheep belong to various people, but
the bands will be driven out regardless of
whether they get mixed or not. There
are rumors of other bands trespassing in
various parts of the reserve/ .- and the
rangers will try to round them up as
quickly as possible. Jj&ggiBun . .

Contrary to general expectation the
Kings County Democratic convention held
in Brooklyn to-night passed oft quietly
and without the predicted bolt of the city
ticket. Resolutions indorsing the nomi
nation of McClellan for Mayor were
adopted, but making no mention of the
names of Grout and Fornes beyond the
indorsement and commendation of the ac
tion of the Kings County delegates in op
posing their nomination in the city con
vention. This was taken as an indication
that the fight will be carried to the polls
and the Tijmmapy candidates for Con
troller and Aldermanlc President will be
generally knifed by the followers of
Hugh McLaughlin. Â£
These nominations were mad?: For Bor
ough President, â¢ Martin W. Litt>eton;
District Attorney, John F. Clarke; Regis
ter, Matthew E. Dooley; County Clerk,
Edward Kauffman.
â¢ An the situation now stands. I think that I
may properly quote these words which I had
penned for my letter of acceptance before the
difficulties transpired: "In this battle, as It
seems to be, there can be no neutrals. He that
â¢Is. not against Tammany Is for It."
As it stands now, four men are being
considered for the office of Comptroller
should Grout be ousted. They are R. Ful
ton Cutting, J. Edward Swanstrom, An
drew T. Sullivan and Henry Hentz. Jo
seph C. Hendrlx and. Julian D. Falrchild
have been dropped.
For the president of the Board of Alder
men three names are being -considered.
The men are Thomas H. Mulry, Steven
Farrelly and Frank C. Travers. Herman
A. Metz has been dropped from considera
tion.
At the headquarters of the Republican
committee also the failure to consider
Metz and Fairchild was announced. It
was learned that Joseph C. Hendrix had
refused to allow his name to be consid
ered.
Mayor Low returned -from Chicago to
day. .After a long conference with lead
ing fusionists to-night at his residence
the Mayor made public a letter written
. by him to-day to R. Fulton Cutting, in
which he expressed himself as being in
accord with Cutting on the attitude ot
Grout and Fornes, and said that Grout a
few days after his nomination had sug
gested that Tammany might Indorse his
nomination, but that In that event he
.would attack Tammany Just the same

sion Mayor Low says:
To-night the situation was practically
unchanged, the rualonlsts waiting: for
their convention on Wednesday, the
Democrats waiting for their opponents to
make the first move before they take
steps to keep Grout and Fornea on the
ticket.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â The feature of the
political situation to-day was Grout's for
mal declaration that he would reÂ«iat all
efforts to force him off the fusion ticket.
What legal steps will be taken by him to
maintain his position, or by the fualonlsts
to compel his retirement, are yet unde
termined.
"He That Is Not Against Tam
many Is for It," Says
Mayor Low.
Grout Declares His In
tention to Remain on
the Ticket.

You can get carpets nowadays for almost any"
price you want to p a y # J3 r ussels, Velvets, Axminsters,
and even the luxurious \\rjltons are imitated â and right
cleverly too â by a class of goods, the patterns of which
are PRINTED on the s ul "f ace > J ust e so much
calico. It is ne e( u ess to saY that these patterns â pro-
duced by printi n g are only on * n e surface and some- :
times wear off long before tne carpet itself is worn
through. Wh en new and viewed on the floor, it is
h a rd to tell printed carpets fâ¢ m genuine dyed in the
yar n goods. But pick up a n cn^ an^ double it over
with your fingers and â pre st Â°l tne imitation is ap-
parent.
The colors of genuine dy ed in the yarn carpets go
clear through to the back an d the patterns will not : .
become brokon by wearing off on the surface.
There is not a single piece, nor a single yard of
printed carpet on the Breunef Carpet Floor. We
therefore can and WILL guarantee every inch of car-
pet we sell to be genuine dyed in the yarn goods.
v Look over these prices, then look at the goods and
compare the QUALITIES with the "wonderfully
cheap ". offerings of the department stores, who con-
tinue to shout in sensational type the bugaboo cry of
"trust â combine " etc.

We have in this report only touched upon
th eoutllnes of the "evils that exist" In tbe
present system " under which the State pilsons
are conducted. We realize that all of thsse
evils car.net be corrected In a day.
All that wo have said concerning .Folsom
prisoa In reference to rrison room Is appli
cable to San Ouentin prison, and our hope Is
that with your aid. co-operation and sympathy,
which we fee! we have, the next Legislature
may make sufficient appropriations to enable
the board to begin the work which will eventu
allr bring about the change so much desired I
and needed. *
In conclusion we wish to say that the me*t i
exTac-dlnary precautions are being taken to
prevent any further outbreak at Folsom prison. ,
still, from the evidenc- taken, the board is ,
satisfied that many of the officers and guards
did not re*oond to the emergency as they i
should, and we are Impressed with the necea- .
sity of a thorough reorganization at Folsi?m i
prison. This Is now engaging our earnest and j
continued attention, and we will accomplish ;
It at the earliest possible moment. The task,
however, is no light cne, and we are under
taking It with the care aad caution that It
demands, realizing that an error of Jf f*ent
cr a hasty act on our part misrht be fatal to the
bTst Interests of the State. We wish to assur
you that we hold ourselves ready at all times
to consult and advise with you concerning the
matters under our charge. Respectfully sub-
FITZGERALD. C. N. FELTOX. J.
H. W1LKINS, DON RAT
Dated September 16. 10CR.
of the Legislature to the urgent need of a wall
around FoJsom orison, but without avail. If
a wall is not provided, sooner or later life will
be eacrlflced in the effort to prevent other pris
on outbreaks. So convinced was your board
of the necessity of a wall that at a meeting of
the board held rrior to the recent outbreak the
Warden was crdered to commence taking out
granite to be used for this purpose, trusting
that the Legislature would make up any de
ficiencies that may bÂ» thus incurred and pro
vide such appropriation as would enable the
board to purchase the necessary cement and
tools, and we hope that cur action will meet
with your approval.
We also wish to caH your attention to the
case of John Martinez, serving a twenty years
sentence for rape, and received at the, prison
November 9. 1S95. Martinez went to the as
sistance of Gatekeeper Chalmers, when be was
assaulted by the convicts, shut the outer gate
and put the key in his pocket and immediately
rang the alarm bell. He also assisted in every
Much has been said and printed concerning
the appointment of trusties at Foiftom prison
and reflecting severely on some. of the trusties
In responsible positions. Whatever may be
the wisdom of there appointments, on this
occasion at least, every trusty who had it
within his power rendered immediate and val
uable services, both at the time of the break
and to those who were so grievously injured.
We desire to call your attention especially to
the case of Joseph Casey, a life termer re
ceived at the prison June .1, 1890, who had
charge of the inner gate. When he saw the
trouble in the yard he immediately closed the
gate as the line wm coming out and kept
within the prison building 500 convicts, thus
preventing what possibly might have been a
general delivery. Casey has been a trusty at
this gate for twelve years, and has never
misted a day from his position. It Is an ex
ceedingly Important position, and >his action
on this occasion deserves the fullest considera
tion and your board unanimously recommends
him for unconditional and Immediate pardon. -
DEALS WITH "TRUSTIES."
The board Is of the opinion, further, that it
was most unwise and imprudent for the War
den and other officers of the prison . to meet
every morninr, as had been their custom.
In the captain' Â« office. Just as the line was
passing out. It afforded the opportunity of
doing just what was done In this case, and
yet It has been the custom for officers to
meet at this same time and place for many
years and while Warden Aull was Warden
of the prison. It furnishes, however, another
Illustration of how easy we can see what
might be done If we always knew what was
goinr to happeiL
So convinced Is the board that It Is the
duty of all officers and guarCs to prevent the
eicape of convicts at every hazart that an
order has been issued making It the Imperative
duty of all officers and guards to prevent
convicts from escaping, whether they have
free men in their charge or not. and when
any each attempt is made by the convicts
the guards must fire. This order applies to
both prisons. ,
The break, however, wag not the result, in
our ODlnion, of a lack of experience on the
part of the officers. Warden WVkinson was
about four year B an officer at San Quentln
prison before assuming the duties of Warden
at Folsom prison, where he has now been
nearly four years. Captain Murphy has been
at Folsora prison twenty-threw- years and Lieu
tenant Kipp fifteen years, and the other guards
and officers captured by the convicts on this
occasion, with the exception of Vertrees and
SÂ«*vey. who were aooolnted In March, 1903.
had been cmDloyed at the prison from one to
ten years. So that many of the officers taken
by the convicts, and wholly surprised on' this
occasion, have had many years' experience at
Fotscm prison and were high la authority,
and their exoerlence. or the opportunity to
benefit by that experience, cannot be Ques
tlcned.
GUARDS MUST DO DUTY.
Tour board Is of the opinion thai ha/1 either
Warden Wilkinson or Captain Murphy refuted
to give the order to the guards not to fire,
when commanded to do so by the convicts,
some of tfce officers and guards in the power
cf the coavicts would ia all probability have
been severely injured, if not mur>red and
In arriving at our conclusions we are not un
mindful of this and fully realize tno position
the officers were placed Â»n. Yet the board
Is unanimously of the opinion that the offi
cers and guards ehou<d have stopped this out
break at all hazards. Unfortunate as it may
be to sacrifice a free man's life. In such a
case we believe that those who accept ruch
positions, where duty sometime makes it
necessary to endanger their lives, this duty
should be fearlewly performed. Your board
!s convinced that had the officer? and guard
who were attacked showed the name during
end nerve as the convicts who attacked them
the convicts could never have left the prison
grounds alive. We also feel that there was
a time when the lieutenant of the *uard could
have stopped the outbreak and prevented the
prisoners from escaping and he should under
rio circumrtances have surrendered" the armory
to the convict*. We do not charge the officers
with 'coward Ice and believe that Â«x!nÂ« com
pletely surprised they acted as they did not
fully realizing the full sense of their 'duty
until the matter was over and tl:e convicts
icon-. It may be well, to add here that Warden
Wilkinson croved that he was not dÂ»>flclÂ»nt In
courage by hit conduct after belnff released
by his captors. While the Imprisoned convicts
were in a etate of wild insurrection he en
tered the building with three officers and per
sonally conducted a lockup at th? Imminent
risk of bis life.
OFFICIATES ARE CENSURED.
We do not think It, necessary to go Into a
more detailed revert of the fact* to you at
this time, as your secretary. A. B. Nye, was
present during all the lnvestlgat:on. and. in
deed, few new facts were elicited In addition
to those airsady published in the pres.Â«.
Tn* gatekeeper. J. Dolaa. was instructed by
the Warden and Captain Murphy to open tte
gate and c* did so. The convicts then took
Dolan with theza and after capturing J. G.
McDoncugh, general overseer, lust outside the
gate, proceeded to the armory, where there
wer* seven or eight guards and Lieutenant of
th* Guard Kipp. Tfce convicts threatened to
blow up the armory with dynamite, whica one
of them carried, unless they were permitted to
tsks arms asd ammunition from tha armory.
Here again Warden Wilkinson and Captain
Murphy, as well as Lieutenant Klpp, ordered
th* guards net to fire, and tbe armory was
surrendered to the convicts. Then the con
victs, after arming themselves, took with them,
in addition to the officers and guards accom
panying them from the yard. Guards W. J.
Hcpton acd L. S. Vertreee. When but a short
distance from tfce prisoa Warden Wilkinson,
Captain Murphy. U. A. Wilkinson. C. H. Ward
end Guard Jolly were released and returned to
tbe prison. Three other officers and guards
made their escape soca afterward. All the
other officers and guards were released the
evening of tfce uce day. No info&nation was
obtained or covid be obtained as to when or
where the weapons and dynamite were ob
tained ty the conrlcts, but as we shall point
out to you hereafter, with the number of of
ficers and guards at our disposal, and the cp
porturaty aSorded convicts to get contraband
goods, and which cannot be prevented under
the presect erstem. It is not at all surprising
that the convicts were able to obtain both the
weapons and dynamite. Of the thirteen con
victs who ezcaped eight are now at large. Al
lison, being wounded at Pilot Hill, committed
suicide. Since that time Convicts Roberts.
Seavis. 'Woods and Murphy have been captured.
We wish here to commend most earnestly the
manly and brave resistance of Turnkey Coch
rane, who. though unarmed, fought the con
victs until be was so severely Injured from re
peated knife thruÂ«t* that he could no longer
continue the fight. The convicts then made
him accompany them through the yard to the
upptr gate, where he fell from exhaustion,
when one of the convicts ttepped out of the
line and violently kicked him in the abdomen
as he lay upon the ground practically dying.
Too much praise cannot bÂ« given Turnkey
Cochrane for his splendid courage and actions
on this day.

PEKING, Oct. 3. â United States Ulnlster
Conger arrived to-day from Shanghai for the
purpose of signing the commercial treaty with
the Chines* commissioners, i
We wish In this report to you to emphasize
the condition and needs of the prisons of Cali
fornia. We have at Folsom prison about four
hundred cells, but" sometimes over nine hun
dred prisoners. At San Quentln prison the
eituation is still worse. No segregation of
prisoners is possible. We are without a prison
wall at Folsom, and eight or nine hundred con
victs are turned loose every morning into an
open field, with nothing but guard posts to con
trol them, and the appropriation made limits
us to the employment of not to exceed forty
three guards. It is impossible to prevent ex
convicts at night from placing on the grounds
weapons, opium, ' dynamite, or other contra
band goods, where they can be obtained by the
inmates of the prison during the day. With
the guard force at hand, the eight hundred
prisoners cannot.be searched twice a day. and
thus I we are slaced at ' the mercy of the ex
convicts and the various prisoners now con
fined at Folsom prison.
We arc compelled in both prisons, for lack
of appropriation, to place trusties in charge of
moat responsible positions, such as bookkeep
ers, telegraph operators, gatekeepers and elec
tricians. The : wonder â¢ Is, . then, we have pro
ceeded thus far with no more serious results.
Tour, board baa frequently called the attention
We favor emphatically In the conduct and
care of the criminals humane and kindly treat
ment, using physical punishment only when
necessary to maintain discipline. But the con
gregate system, where all are together in tho
same yard, young and old. bad and indifferent.
Is what we most complain of and protest
against. This system has been abandoned by
practically every other State In the United
States, but California seems ' content with it,
notwithstanding that under this system, pleas
ant though' It may be for the more hardened
prisoners, she Is educating criminals and is.
as has been well said (though perhaps not real
ized by her citizens), a partner in crime. Cor
rection under this system Is wholly impossible.
Indeed no approach at reformation can be
hoped for while the system lasts. But worsÂ«
than this, the young men are educated crimi
nals before leaving the prison. Under such a
system no officer or set of officers can expect
improvement In any man who Is confined In
either prison. We believe that the congregate
system has been better administered in Cali
fornia, and is being better administered at the
present time, than anywhere else in the world
where It has been tried, and It may be that
because of this fact the system remains, not
withstanding the nrotests and efforts of those
who have the prisons In charge. The condi
tion of each prison has been fully explained,
and protest against the same has been made to
every Governor for the last twelve or fifteen
years, as It waa to yourself prior to the break.
A plea has been made through the resorts of
your board for additional prison room, to
every Legislature for the last ten or twelve
years, but no heed has been paid to these re
ports, because, as has been said to us on more
than one- occasion, "Oh. you are doing very
well, the prisons are getting along all right."
APPROPBIATIONS NEEDED.
SYSTEM IS AT FAULT.
These criticisms, unjust and hasty as we
know them to be, have not In the slightest In
fluenced the action of the board, nor have their
utterance engendered any personal feeling
whatever, for it has always been patent to us
that they have been made either in lenorar.ee
of the facts or by misguided sentimentalists,
and that some day the people of California
would learn the truth about the prisons of this
State, and. when understood, would respond as
piomptly and generously as they have to the
n^eos of ether departmer.ts of the government.
It is to be regretted, however, that personal
abure of prison officials and the death of inno
cent people are r.ecessary to attract public at
tention to the "evils that exist" and the cry-
Ing needs of the State prisons, but such seems
t--> be the case.
It is a sufficiently difficult task to control
the convicts of California under the system in
vogu* in this State, and which your board Is
convinced Is a disgrace to the State, without
the convicts feeling that the public at large
sympathize with them and not with the offi
cers of the law. As you know, the prisons In
California are conducted under what is knswn
as the "congregate system." the same system
which was adopted in this State fifty years
ago. No chance has been made in this sys
tem: it Is the game to-day as it was then. Cal
ifornia has practically stood still In this par
ticular for half a century. True, the adminis
tration of that Fystem has been Improved in
many material respects. For years your beard
has endeavored to eliminate from the manage
ment of the State prisons any political influ
ence cr interference and that is its present
aim. We are pleased to say that we have suc
ceeded in this to a very great extent and wish
to acknowledge cur appreciation of your ex
pressed desire to aid us in this particular. We
do not believe that there is any prison in the
world where prisoners are better fed than in
the prisons of California; and certainly there
are no prisons where they are fed as well for
the same cost. The health and physical condi
tion of the prisoners are most carefully guard
ed, and It has been frequently a matter of crit
icism, made by those familiar with prison
methods In other countries and In other States
of this country, that our convicts are too well
treated.
CRITICISMS ABE UNJUST.
It Is a sad commentary for us to have to
repeat to you that the condition of Folsom
Prison Is such, that because of lack of suffi
cient prison accommodations we have to con
fine prisoners In their cells, who endeavor to
assist the of 2eeÂ«,'* either by giving them Infor
mation of plots to escape or aid the officers
when an outbreak occur*, in order to 'protect
these convicts from the fury and assaults of
other prisoners, who are ever ready to take the
life of any conxict who attempts to aid the
authorities in any way. Such Is practically the
condition in bcth prisons to-day and your board
i* heipless and powerless to char.ge it without
legislative action which will enable the board
to provide for additional prison room.
Many causes have led to the prison outbreak,
not the least of which has been the record of
convicts in other prieens who have become no
torious because of their exploits in breaking
Jai! a.nd taking life after their escape and
while being pursued. Again, there seems to
pervade a sickly sentimentality among sctne
people concerning the treatment of prisoners in
the State prisons of California, which found
voice during the last session of the Legislature,
when It was cade to appear, in pulpit and
rostrum, that the real felons were those who
were ttrivins to control the convicts In both
pr.sons by enforcing the sharp discipline that
experience has proved necessary in dealing
with desperate men. The con\'lcts were made
the heroes; the officers and guards the law
breakers. Since that time unrest has pervaded
both prisons to a greater or less degree.

Electro-Chenistry crrea the old as well ts the young of deafness and all
ear diseases. It cures cases that the older methods of treatment cannot
even help. Any one suffering fron deafness, head or ear noises, dis-
charging ears, are cordially invited to come to the Electro-Chemic Insti-
tute, xiS Grant ave^ and investigate this wonderful new and successful
treatment. A carefsl examination will be made, free of charge, and the
patient will be told just what can be expected from treatment. . When
jk. case it hopeless the sufferer will be told so, end there will be no expense
anvolTed.
The Electro-Chemic X-Ray.
The Elcctro-Cnrmic X-Ray cures CANCER, TUMORS, OLD
â¢SORES. LUPUS. ECZEMA, CONSUMPTION aad CATARRH of the
LUNGS, and it is the only treatment known to science that will cure
these diseases.
Every sufferer is welcome to call for free X-Ray Examination, and
to the skeptical we will give ample proof of the truth of the above claim.
Electro-Chemistry cures diseases of the STOMACH, LIVER, KID-
NEYS and BOWELS. The worst cases are quickly and permanently
cured. Cases which are usually made worse by medical treatments yield
promptly to Electro-Chemistry. Bring a small bottle of morning urine
for free examination,
SPECIAL DISEASES of WOMEN, the kind that usually send the
safferer to the surgeon, are cured by Electro-Chemistry painlessly. No
cutting, no dosing with powerful and poisonous medicines.
The Electro-Chemic treatment for women is absolutely devoid of all
objectionable features, and the most delicate, the most nervous women,
take the treatment with pleasure and delight, and they feel improvement
from the very first application. This is equally so in SPECIAL DIS-
EASES of MEN. In a short time we will publish the testimonial of an
eld man cured of prostatic trouble. This was a case which the surgeon
wanted to operate upon. The old man is so happy over the painless
Electro-Chemic cure that he wants to give us a public testimonial.
We will publish it just as soon as we can get up to it, but we wish
our patients to understand that our practice is sacredly confidential, and
no testimonial is published or asked for except with the free consent and
approval of the cured patient. Our office is arranged with private and
retired apartments for our male and female patients.
HOME TREATMENT.
We loan to outside patiests oar Electro-Cheinic apparatus for home treat-
ment free of charge. We advise all our cctside patients, when it can possibly
be done, to come to our ofr.ee for a thorough personal examination. In. most
â¢ instances the patient can return home the same day, taking the necessary treat-
T-.K:t along. When it is irnt>oss:b!e to visit us, write a careful description of
principal symptoms and fall instructions will be promptly forwarded for home
examination and treatment.

Wong Chink, the alleged murderer of
Wong Yock Chung, who was arrested last
night, and three others were examined
at police headquarters to-day and the
facts learned, it is said, substantiate the
conspiracy theory. Police Officer Allen
brought to police headquarters to-day a
mail garment worn by Wong Chink when
he was arrested. It consists of a number
of thin steel plates, covered with silk
and held together with chains. Officer
Allen says the residents of Chinatown
state that the alleged murderer escaped
from San Francisco some years ago after
the murder of a Chinese in that city in
a manner similar to last night's affair
here. The police of San Francisco have
been asked by telegraph about the mat
ter and the Bertlllon measurements of the
suspect will be wired to the California
city for possible identification. ;

In addition to the troubles in Cripple
Creek, mining has been almost entirely
suspended In the Telluride and Ophir dis
tricts, where about 1500 miners and mill
men were called out in order to enforce
the demand for an eight-hour day. There
have been no disturbances in those placet
and no troops # are stationed there. Hun
dreds of strikers have left the State,
seeking work elsawhere.
DENVER, Oct. 3.â Strikes and lockouts
at the mines in Cripple Creek and other
gold mining districts In Colorado have
already reduced the mineral production
of this State this year at least $2,500,000,
and If the present conditions obtain until
the end of- the year the production will
fall more than $6,000,000 below what It
would have been under normal conditions.
In consequence of the strike 1000 soldiers
of the Colorado National Guard have been
doing police duty in Cripple Creek for
four weeks and as yet neither the mine
owners nor the strikers show any evi
dence, of weakening. The cost to the
State of maintaining a military force in
the field Is estimated at $50,000 a month.
Governor James H. Peabody was made
the defendant to-day in two damage
suits in $100,000 each, filed by Patrick II.
Mullaney and Thomas Foster, union min
ers who were arrested by military of
ficers on duty in Cripple Creek, confined
in the guardhouse fifteen days and set
at liberty last Wednesday after habeas
corpus proceedings were ' instituted in"

IN MANY DISTRICTS.
Considering the Influence of the h!ch price
" "of labor and moierlal en the real estate mar
ket, this is a *Â¦- -j showing and is tha highest
monthly total s:r.co May last. The principal
increase octurn-J la the lOo vara and Western
Addition sections. The dem&sd fcr fine resi
dences in the best portions ol the Western Ad
dition is noticeably heavier, and seema to be a
- marked icrr.e.- i for residences and not for lots
on which to bulid residences. The cost of
erecting residences has deterred even well T to-do
' people from enttrir.g into contracts for their
'erection. In the 100-vara section there 1& an
Increased cc â urd for large warehouse sites
ca the lines of the Southern Pacific llallroad
or the Santa Fe. Many of our larga wholesale
houses are endeavoring to concentrate from
ifaree or four warehouses in various parts of
ibe city to cne larg^ rite on the railroad tracks.
The entrance of the Santa Fe into tha.t portion
of the lw-vara district "south of Channel
ttreet and the application of the Western Pa
cific Railroad for a franchise to do the same
thing, has opened up a considerable area of
thU warehouse property. The figures for tha
other section of the city are up to or exceed
the average for ths past few months. As
every one acquainted with the situation
knows, there has be<n very heavy buying of
real estate in this city for the past two and a
half to three years: heavier than ever before in
our history. Prices advanced steadily, bat thw
buying continued, and net until most of the
available property v.as either bought or placed
by prevailing conditions to a price which buy
ers thought excessive, did the heavy buying
rartially ceese. The salable properties left In
the market are very largely tho&e piece* on
which the buyer rr.uf-t at once erect a modern
structure If he wishes to tet an adequate re
turn on his Investment. The nearly prohibitive
price of building, end the uncertainty attend
ing erection of buildings, have held these buy
ers back and prevented a very large number
of rales of business rroperties. The real estate
-. market has been a good one in *plte of all this
trouble.

When you buy butter do not depend on
chance. Call at Murphy & Paul's modern
creameryâ 123 Sixth streetâ and you can
peep behind the scenes and see that you
take no chances when you use their but
ter. Their modern methods have cut out
the risk and produced the purest and best
flavored butter known to science. â¢/
even private residences are often put out
because local disasters at times cut off
the supply of creamery products. Per
sons that deal wjth this creamery are not
subject to these interruptions for their
supply comes from separated districts and
the product may bo relied on.
Your butter supply is of vital Impor
tance to your family, and you should visit
123 Sixth street, even if you do not buy
one of the tempting rolls you see. â¢ It is
worth something .to say you have seen
a modern creamery, a place where dairy
products are made right and handled
right.
Every part of the Btorage space and
every Inch of the salesroom is permeated
by the clean odor of sanitation, for clean

Imparting a greenlsh^olor to oysters is
another adulteration. An oyster requires
about one month In the bed3 to acquire
the greenish color. As this Is too long a
time the dealers help them along with an
artificial color. The, chemists in the Pari3
municipal laboratories have shown that
tomato Jelly' is adulterated with turnips
and powdered pepper contains a large ad
mixture of powdered hardtack.â Scientific
American.*
Chopped artificial truffles are made of
black rubber, silk or softened leather, and
even Whole trufiles are made out of roast
ed potatoes, which are flavored by adding
ether. They are said to sell well.
Fish spoiled In spite of icÂ© and borax
Is treated with salts of zinc, aluminum
"and other metals. Rubbing the fish with
vaseline to give it a fresh look and color

is also used to Intensify the. red color-of
Inferior crabs.
In Paris snails are popular, and the
adulterators mix them with lungs of cat

snails- are manufactured. The shells, re
coatcd with fat and slime, are filled with
lung and then sold as "Bergundy" snails.
Lovers of fresh rooster combs are Im

Food Frauds} Abroad.
We are telling you. these things because
In a great city the problem of pure food
is not always easily settled, and few buy
ers know how food is prepared, where it
is prepared- and where sold. This is par
ticularly true of butter, for It is- subject
to many ups and downs, and if.;iot prop
erly made and properly kept it soon be
comes very bad.
' It was stated at the outset of this littta
chat that the fresh milk from which this
butter is made comes from a wide area
ten counties. Hotels, restaurants and
Even' householder should know where
to t>uy pure food. But where to buy pure
foodâ there's the rub! Â¦ So this is an hon
est little butter talk, and you can settle
the Question of buying butter by remem
bering what is said here. But before
going further it should be stated that
Messrs. Murphy & Paul have Just" equip
ped a large scientific creamery at 123 Sixth,
streetâ but there's more to say!
At their modern depot they -handle the
product of 12,000 cows, and receive cream
and milk from ten counties, thus insuring
an outDut that floods, trainwrecks and
local disasters cannot interrupt. A good
pointâ but better points follow.
The butter from this product is never
made in a haphazard way. This mean3
that when you buy at 123 ' Sixth street
you buy a delicious, sweet and pure arti
cle. It is made as scientists would make
it â free from injurious germs. And when
it is made it Is not piled in care^ss heaps.
It is put In clean places where thermom
eters record thp purifying temperature of
dry cold. A modern carbonic refrigerat
ing machine carries the saving touch of
Arctic purity to every Inch of the show
cases and cold storage, receptacles. Even
in tho windows that face the fetreet there
is winter: and as you pans you may see
clean and wholesome ' butter by thO ' side
of frosted pipes that carry the purity of
a New Kngland Christmas to every cubic
inch of .the healthful air. That's the way
to keep butter ' right â and If it is made
right the result cannot be wrong. 'â¢= â¢â¢
This great home' of butter is for the
benefit of all the people, and the hum
blest householder may buy 10 cents' worth
of the same quality that is sold to whole
salers. It will Interest you to visit 123
Sixth streetâ and remember that / they
churn there every day.
The food makes the man â even more the
child. .The value of proper food is gen
erally recognized, and sclcntistg.say that
wholesome victuals are responsible for
good health,, long life and brave deeds.
And Pasteurized butter will keep you and
your children well.
Thousands of precautions are now taken
to make the world's food wholesome, for
it Is known that many diseases come from
eating bad food. In view of this truth
no one should take any unnecessary
chances with his eating. You take- no
chances with the Murphy & Paul butter.
Butter Is an Important foodâ and It should
be sweet. Otherwise it poisons the sys
tem and. ruins digestion. If bad It will
spoil the best meal, and no cook has the
cunning to disguise the taste and. over
come the evil ; of Impure butter. Good
butter is the crowning glory of, a. good
meal, and health follows â¢ its use. Since
the days of our grandfathers great pro
gress has been made In the science - of
making butterâ and pure, modern butter
Is both palatable and wholesome.

The |2SQ was returned to Rea and Se
lipman was taken to the City Prison and
locked up in the tanks. A dispatch was
*ent to J. Bassett Jr., St. Louis, on whom
Scligman had drawn the draft for $1500
and a reply was received from him that
â¢ he wou.d not honor any of Seligman's
draft?. Sc'.ipman was released from cus
tody yesterday morning.
The case for which he Is waiting trial
Is for obtaining J7j commission from tt!e
Conservative IJfe Insurance Company on
a: policy that he Issued to ex-Judge
George EL Bahrs under false pretenses.
He represented to Bahrs that he was the
nj.ar.ager of the company and retained
him as counsel for the company at a fee
of C>J per annum, which was the amount
of the premium on the policy held by
Bahrs.
He had a checkered career in the Pug-et
Sound cities before coming here and was
arrested there several times, but his
mother liquidated the amounts involved
and he escaped prosecution.
WILL NOT HONOR DRAFT.
â¢TAKEN TO BEA'S BANXEEL
. Rea thought he would be doing his own
bask, the Itai!an-Axnerican, a good turn
and would at the same time learn of tho
.naaxcial standing of Seligman by taking
â¢him there. They went there and Rea was
gratified to find that the cashier and Se
ligman knew each other.
The draft for 11500 was deposited for
collection and they returned to Rea's of
fice. ' Sellffman cald he urgently needed
S250 and if Rea would advance him. that
amount he would give him a note pay
able on sight. The money was advanced
# aaÂ«l Seiigman wrnt away.
Rea, after thinking over the matter,
became ur.eayy and while at lunch he
asked a friecd if he knew Seligman. The
friend rejjiied that he did and that Se
ligman was "as crooked as a ram's horn."
Rea and his friend went to police head
quarters' and Detective Ryan was de
tailed to find Scljgman. When Ryan saw
Seligman and told him his business Se
ligman said, "All right, I'll go with you
and return the money to Rea." They
were walking along Front street when
Selipman asked to be excused for a mo
ir.er.t. He walked quickly into the office
cf the Western Transfer and Storage
Company, :Â£3 Front street, and came out
s-rnlkr.pr. It was later discovered that he
had borrowed $S0, which he evidently
reeded to make up the 52S0 obtained from
Rea.
Si. Carlton SeJljrman, who is out on
bor.ds awaiting; trial la tho Superior
Coi:rt on a charge of obtaining money by
fa!$e pr*tens<?s, again got himself into
troubla with the police* on Friday. Ho
â¢was arrested by Detective Ryan, but was
released yestexday morning.
. Seligman opened a liquor store >it 217
Clay street about a mor.th ago. It was
acnounced that ho would do a wholesale,
retail and rec'Jfylnar business, but up to
the present time he has neglected to pro
cure the necessary license. The name
over the door Is "H. IC Scllgman & Co."
â¢On Friday morning Sellyman called upou
H. L. Rea & Co.. internal revenue brok
ers, <17 Battery street, and told Rea that
he wasted him to do his brokerage busi
ness. Sellcman talked so glibly about
rectifying liquor end the business gener
ally that Rea come to the conclusion hÂ«
was en experienced liquor nan.
After talking fcr some time Saligman
said he had an uncle in St. Louis who
was backing him in the business and hÂ»
was on his way to the bank to deposit a
. Craft for $1W9 on his unc!e for collection.

JUST TO MAKE A SCORE
MORE HAPPY HOMES
Fine Square Pianos and Some Excellent Used Uprights â 50 to Be
Sold at Less Than Half Valuation by Pommer-Eilers.
You'll be surprised to know how llttlo more room a modern square
piano actually occupies than an upright. Squares are a little out of fash-
ion" in flats and boarding-houses, but. nevertheless, a square piano Is
much better and much more desirable than a.n ordinary, cheap or me-
dium grade upright or one of those "stencil pianos," with dealers' names
on their fallboards, that are so vigorously exploited in certain quarters.
"We received seventeen square pianos in part payment for new Kim-
balls and Deckers and Hazeltons last week. People are moving Into new
homes and want new pianos. Most of them seem to be getting into tho
habit of buying their new pianos here. We told you they would. It's be-
cause we furnish a better piano for less money than can any other dealer
or agency. - -*j -;Â¦Â¦Â¦'
But back to the second-hand piano rooms. It's simply overflowing
with them. We need the room for new Instruments arriving daily for the
holiday trade. Hence this merciless price-cutting:
EMERSOX, fine rosewood case, good tone, $56. Pay $10 down and %K a
month.
VOSE, in quite good order, $28. Pay $8 down and $3 a month.
FISCHER, a beauty, $73. Pay $10 down and $3 a month.
CHICKERING.- the finest we have ever had, and we havÂ© sold hun-
dreds of them, $110. Pay $10 down and $3 a month.
(Just the thing for some big. spacious studio or parlor.)
VOSE. a beautiful carved walnut case, fine tone, $S3. Pay $10 down
and $4 a month.
KIMBALLi square, in excellent order, $S3. Pay $10 down and $3 a
month.
HAL.LET & DAVIS square, a beauty, the old reliable, $S3. Same terms.
CHICKERING, very good order, good tone, $46. Pay $6 down and $3 a
month.f
ANOTHER CHICKERING, not quite so good, $42. Pay $5 down and $3
a month. â¢
And a score or more of good csed uprights at correspondingly low
prices. All on easy terms.
Remember, when It comes to selling new pianos we are In position to
furnish the best Instruments at Idwer prices than can be obtained else-
where. s

A SHIP BRAKE, as the name In
dicates, is Intended to check the
epeed of the vessel and lessen the
chances of collisions. Recent ex
periments have well demonstrated
Its efficiency and we may soon seo its
general adoption, especially for vessels
fclylrg on crowded waterways.
The Canadian Government a short time
-ago equipped one of Its vessels, the
steamer Eureka, with the brake shown in
the accompanying illustration, and very
satisfactory trials of its working were
made on the St. Lawrenoa River, near
Montreal.
Tbe steamer was driven ahead at an in
dicated speed of eleven knots an hour.
Then steain was shut off and simultane-'
ously the brake en each side opened. The
Â¦ vessel came to a full stop within a dis
tance equal to her own length. The
r brakes were then closed and the vessel
Bent ahead until the original speed was
again attained, when Eteam was shut off
and the brakes opened, with the result
that all headway ceased by the time sho
had gone half her length, or about fifty
leet
In maneuvering the Eureka at full
speed she was turned within her own
; length with one brake thrown open. An
examination of her hull and mechanism
after the tests showed no apparent harm
ful strain or other damage, and in ope
rating the brake no Jar or vibration was
observable by those on board.
This new form of brake, as will be seen
from the Illustration, is placed on the
eldes of the hull, and in its construction
and method of attachment to the ship re
sembles somewhat an ordinary rudder.
It extends downward from the extreme
load line of tho vessel to the bilge keel,
convenience of stowing and handling the
necessary area being secured by making
the brake relati'vely deep in proportion to
. Its width. The- "gate." as It Is called,
consists of a stout plate of steel, heavily
reinforced, which is hinged vertically to
the vessel, and normally, when not in use,
Is folded snugly against the side of the
ship. A. aeriea of heavy steel struts are
: plvotlcally attached to the back of the
gate near Its outer edge, and also to a
eeries of Eliding plates which are arranged
to more horizontally In covered ways,
built into the structure of the hull. When
the gate la folded forward against the
elde of the ship, the sliding plates are,
of course, at the forward end of the cov
ered ways, but as the gate Is released and
thrown open by the pressure of the
water as the ship travels forward, the
eliding plates travel backward in their
pockets and Â¦congress tho water that li
contained within the covered ways. At
the rear end cf these ways la a number
of orifices, which allow the water to es
cape gradually as the gate In Opening
pushes the elides backward. The forward
edge cf the gate Is secured in place, when
the brake Is not in action, by a series of
catches arranged on a vortical shaft. The
rod on which the gate Is hinged Is pro
vided with a bevel gear by which the gate
may be started to open. The method of
operation Is as follows: When It Is de-
Elred to stoo the vessel suddenly, as in
the event of a collision, or when making
a landing, the catches that hold the for
ward ends of the gate are released, and
by means of the bevel gear the gate is
clighUy opened. The pressure of tho
water then catches on tho forward edge
of the gate, swings it out to the full-open
position, sudden jar or shock being pre
vented by raeans of the water cushions at
the back of the slices. The movement of
the brake can be controlled entirely either
from the bridge or from the engine room,
as may be desired.

The system of posting and collecting
letters by electric tram? which has been
successfully tried in some of the northern
towns of Great Britain is being adopted
on the electric tramway system at Syd
ney, In New South Wales, but on a more
extensive scale. The schemo Includes the
erection of a Email clearance oSlce at one
of the important termini, and letters as
they are cleared will be sent off by mes
sengers to the general postofflce every
fifteen minutes. In this way. It is be
lieved, communication between the sub
urbs and the city will be greatly expe

i\/i same Â°^ ce - e sees m t^ iem a J 0^ l ot Â°* s i mster Â» secret, dark and midnight purposes, inim-
I If 1 ical to the public welfare, and which can be carried out only by perjury and crime. In the
-*Â¦ ' Â¦Â¦*Â¦ eye of his political mind he sees San Francisco as a political Sodom, in which he is the
one righteous and chosen man.
Mr. Lane is credited with sincerity, and therefore we are sorry that he feels so bad. Sincere
is a good word. It comes from sine cerum, without wax, and was applied by the Latins to pure
strained honey, with no bees' wax. Now we beg to assure^ Mr. Lane that he is not the only honey
in the hive. There be others without wax, and while his opponents may be much mistaken in having
views that he does not approve, they may be just as honest as he. It is not good form to rail at his
fellow-citizens. He may not ride that rail into office. The old world jogged along, and there was
seed time and harvest, marrying and giving in marriage, and equinox and solstice came in their sea
son, before he was born. States rose and fell, dynasties waxed and waned before he came mewling
and puking into the mix-up, and so things will go on after he has done office seeking and has gone to
institute reforms in the sphere of ineffable things. We are sorry that he thinks so badly of the world
and of the people in it, and that he has so poor an opinion of San Francisco, where he has surely been
treated with great kindness. Mayhap the horrid and abhorrent vision that he sees is due to a torpid
liver, and the direful conditions exist nowhere above his own midriff. 4
It is true that Mayor Schmitz fiddles a good deal, but he has not indulged in that pastime over
a general conflagration of the city. He has committed several excesses in the line of musical composi
tion, but there, is nothing absolutely criminal in his thoroughbass and counterpoint. No doubt the
city deserves and will get a less musical and more practical , Mayor, but there is no need to despair so
early in the game. As for Henry J. Crocker, he has gone up and down among us, with his hands
in his own pockets, a reputable business man, working for the gains he has gathered, and has not
invested a dime in a horn on which to trumpet his own virtues, or in a prize vocabulary in which to
decry others. Physically his ground plan and front elevation much resemble the dimensions of Mr.
Lane, and he has existed without the revenues of office. By force of his own qualities and by virtue of
his own exertions he is quite above financial temptation, and would no more touch a dirty dollar than
Mr. Lane would barter his vote for a belly full of steam beer/
It has been intimated that Mr. Lane thinks that Mayor Schmitz has a conspirator's complexion,
and moreover he does not like the way the Mayor wears his hair. Though it is pompadour, we must
insist that the Mayor does not wear his morals pompadour, and it is not fair for Mr. Lane, who does
not wear hair at all, to carry another man's hair into politics. \\*e hope that Mr.'Lane will think better
of his plan of campaign and admit that there may be a few honest men in this city besides himself,
for we want to think well of him, though not quite so well as he thinks of himself.

ENGLAND'S GRBAT PREMIER, WHOSD LIFE, "WRITTEN BY JOHN
MORLEY AND BOON TO APPEAR. WILL, FURNISH THE EVENT OP
THE PUBLISHING SEASON IN LONDON.
The Cincinnati Enquirer has ample illustration of the results of municipal ownership in Ohio.
The towns of Columbus, -Toledo, Hamilton, Xenia, and many others in that State, find themselves
wallowing in a mire of debt and failure as the result of taking the advice of socialist enthusiasts and
going counter to Mr. Thornton's admirable statement of principle : "I am opposed to the intervention
of Government in any class of enterprises which. are in conflict with and opposition to private
undertakings." ' .Â¦
H HE letter of Mr. Crittenden' Thornton, declining a nomination given to him by the dty Demo
cratic convention, is a measure of the wide departure from its principles which the Democratic
party has taken within the last few years. A leader of the American socialists said that the
Â¦ *â¢ . Democratic party v having become the instrument of their purposes, they were inclined to coal
esceHvith it, with the view of leading it further into their programme.
No two principles were originally wider apart than those of Jefferson and Fourier. Jefferson
believed in restricting the authority of government to its purely political functions. Truest has been
claimed that his advocacy of the common schools was socialistic. But jn reality it was due to his belief
that education should be purely secular and that, as the welfare of the state depended upon the intelli
gence of the citizens, it was the duty of the state to give the people a secular education in the common
schools. It is a far cry from secular education by the State to State ownership of all the sources of
profit and all the productive industries.
A recent writer on the socialistic policy of New Zealand, who highly approves of it, says that
the only activities left to individual enterprise are farming, navigation and limited manufacturing.- The
ambition of the people is not to engage in industrial enterprise, but to be employed by the Government
in its various ventures, including banking and insurance. The. system includes a civil pension, so that
the motive for personal thrift is withdrawn. The people use their political power to vote to themselves
wages and salaries as employes of the Government, and have lost the foresight which, by economy,
makes wise provision for the future, and so they live from day to day, expecting to exist on the Gov
ernment pension when they are superannuated.
The Democratic party seems to have entered upon the same policy here, and there is no reason
to doubt that, if adopted, it will lead to the. same result. Here and there a Democrat like Mr. Thorn
ton files a protest, but it has- but little present effect upon the new lights which are guiding the party.
The Cincinnati Enquirer, one of the oldest and strongest Democratic papers in the Central West, an
tagonizes the socialistic tendencies of the party. In a recent editorial that paper said: "In these days
when so many cheap politicians are howling merrily for Government ownership it is good, to print
again, and then again, the observations of so eminent an authority as Charles Francis Adams, who
has thoroughly investigated the question in Europe. In a letter to a Kansas City man he says: 'I can
only say that as the result of careful official investigation on my part I have never yet found in Europe
anywhere a case of municipal or public transportation worthy of an Instant's consideration as com
pared with our own. Whatever complaints you may make of it, private monopoly and all that, we
here in America do things in the transportation line which in Europe they do not even dream of, and
wherever Government lays its hand upon a line it becomes, in comparison with ours, paralyzed at once.
The municipal systems in use in Glasgow would lead to a riot within twenty-four hours if put in opera
tion in Kansas City. The' fact is, when it comes to handling private business, every Government is, in
my opinion, utterly incompetent, whether it is a water system, schools, railroads, telegraphs, postoffices
or what not. Every time private enterprise would do it four times as-well at about half the cost. Please
don't talk to me of doing business through Government machinery; it is one colossal exhibition of
waste, extravagance and incompetence.'
"The arguments in favor of Government ownership are generally specious, and are put forward
by enthusiasts who are unsound on nearly every public proposition. The republican form of govern
ment could not endure under such a system."
The Chicago Chronicle, another strong Democratic paper, takes the same ground, but seems
to be merely crying in the wilderness of socialism, in which the party is groping the way to its end.
The present city administration of San Francisco is in the hands of doctrinaires on the sub
ject of public ownership, and it is amazing that the Democratic platform impeaches that administra
tion of failure and incompetency in all of the essentials of government that are committed to it, and
yet insists that the city take the risk of committing to a like administration which may come in the
future the control of business investments made by the city and amounting to millions !
When the very reasonable- demand is made that such investments be safeguarded by making
the bonds issued in their behalf a lien upon them, and.-not upon the whole city, the organ of the Democr
racy insists that this reasonable security for honesty of administration be rejected, and the door of the
city treasury be .thrown wide open to any raid that a future city government may choose to make upon
the taxpayers, in carrying on a business which the same organ admits will be more costly than in
private hands. __

Rivela was brought to this country as
leader of Ellery's Royal Italian Band and
In every city in which he appeared he
was given a series of ovations. He no
where paraded any eccentric actions ln
order to create enthusiasm, but devoted
all his energies to bringing before the
public the ability of the musicians under
his baton.
Plans have already been formulated for
Rivela to lead a picked band In the Inter
national competition that will be a fea
ture of the St. Louis Exposition next
year.
"California." he said, 'is to be my
home. It is so like Italy and the people
here are bo musical. They love music
here and that is one of the reasons I
shall ireside in California. Look at the
splendid treatment the .people here gave
to my friend, Mascagnl. The composer
will never forget the generosity of Cali
fornia. As to my plans for the future. I
Bhall organize a band of talented musicians
and intend to give a number of concerts
in San Francisco and on this coast. I
had a number of fine offers to locate In
New York, but I prefer California fpr
many reasons."
Rivela is looked upon as the coming con
ductor of the school of music in which
Mascagni. Leoncavello and Puccini are
prominent. He was born ln Salerno,
Italy, in 1S71 and was educated In Naples.
He was the leader of many bands in Italy
and won the first prize at the competi
tions held in Naples and Turin In 1898. At
the Turin competition he competed against
15C bands and won the coveted prize. The
King of Italy personally congratulated
him on his ability and made him a cheva
lier, decorating him with the insignia of
merit.
After a short wedding tour. Chevalier
Rivela and his bride journeyed to Califor
nia and arrived here a few days ago. They
took a charming flat at 3018 California
street and in this cozy nest music and
love hold sway.
Chevalier Rivela was seen yesterday
and admitted that he was a benedict, but
was surprised to find that his secret waa
known.
The young lady and her mother pro
ceeded to Kansas City, where Rivela was
playing, and the musician and the fair
Californian were wedded.
No inkling was given by the young lady
or the maestro that anything more than
an ordinary acquaintanceship existed be
tween them and their secret of mutual
affection was closely guarded.
Rivela went East with his musicians
and two months ago Miss Mills and her
mother informed their freinds that they
were going- to visit friends ln the Middle
West.
Rivela knew but little English, but Miss
Mills was conversant with the Italian,
language and the young couple were able
to discuss art and music
When Rivela was delighting thousands
at the Pavilion by the magic wield of
his baton he was introduced to Miss Net
tie Mills, a talented and beautiful Cali
fornian. Miss Mills, who resided with
her widowed mother in Oakland, was a
leader in musical circles in the city across
the bay and she was attracted by the
talents of the conductor.
When Rivela took San Francisco by
6torm he often declared that he was de
voted to his art and that "music was his
mate." Now Cupid has upset the calcu
lations of the leader and the heart of the
conductor and composer has been cap
tured. .
Chevalier Emillo Rivela. the gifted
leader of the Royal 'Italian Band, who
created a furore when he was heard at
the Pavilion last December, has returned
to San Francisco and is accompanied by a
beautiful bride. - .

Patch"; Miss Anna Jessup gave an amus
ing reading from "Mrs. Wiggs."
In addition to the above there were
vocal selections by Miss Nettville, one
of the numbers being "Calm as the
Night." M. Well lectured on laces, illus
trating his words with an exhibition of
beautiful specimens of the lacemaker's
art. He said that the history of old laces
runs down to the close of the eighteenth
century, laces being at their height in
the seventeenth century. He stated that
a collection of 1S3 pieces had' been sold
ft> the Metropolitan Museum for $100,000.
Copies of Genoese point.' one of the old
est laces now made In Le Puys, France;
of Macrame knotted lace, of filet and
cut laces, some of the earliest known,
were shown. He spoke of the edict of
Nantes which scattered the lacexnakers
all over Europe and of the laws which
forbade the importation of lace into Eng
land, also of the hardships of the lace
makers to introduce their wares Into that
territory and told of the schemes to smug
gle such into the country. He told of
the Pointe d'Angleterre lace and then
dwelt upon Venetian point as one of the
choicest and richest laces, although the
Machlin laces are the rarest, as much as
$140 a yard being paid for lace one inch
wide. He explained that it takes an ooe-

who has a keen perception of the differ

can be proud of.
From the number of men that are dis
charged from the various organizations
ln the State "for the good of the service"
it would appear that there Is not suf

the minimum accept every man who says
he wants to enlist, irrespective of men r

result that undesirable men get into com

spect for themselves retire by securing
discharge on the ground of removal, and
after a time the undesirable men being
found a detriment to the company, .' are
discharged "for the good of the service."

Each man was viewed favorably by the
Board of Prison Directors.' Finally, how
ever, the experience gained by Standley
as an official in handling criminals threw
the balance to his side and a majority of
the board now favors hi* candidacy- 1
Standley is â¢ known as ' one of the most
expert and" unrelenting thelftakers in the
State of California. He has taken part in
many of the notable man', hunts that have
made- the criminal history of . California
famous - and has always -'borne a "gallant
part. ' In 1896 he was severely wounded by.
a bandit he was pursuing. Wells, Fargo
& Co. \ who have often employed Stand*
ley's services -in tracking "down robbers,
threw all its Influence ' in his favor for
the Wardenship of Folsom. The candi
date is a Democrat lh politics and by cus
tom ' the place belongs to a Democrat,
Warden Tompklns of San Quentin being
a Republican. f
The selection was made by the process
of elimination. ' There were numerous
candidates for the place in view of the
fact that Warden Wilkinson could not be
expected to succeed himself. The direc
tors canvassed ' the list thoroughly and
gave full consideration to the claims of
tho various aspirants. They were anxious,
above all things, to secure the services
of a competent man.
' Finally the race narrowed down to a
contest between Sheriff TJ. S/ Gregory of
Amador County, ex-Sheriff J. M. Stand
ley of Mendoclno County and T. J. Fallon,
Treasurer of Marln County. Gregory was
warmly championed by Prison Director
Don Ray and for a time his chances ap
peared promising. Then, despite the sup
port of Director Ray, he was eliminated
from the race and Fallon and Standley
remained. -",';- 5 I
When the Board, of Prison Directors
meets, on November 10 the appointment of
a new . Warden of Folsom penitentiary
will be one of the main subjects of con
sideration. It has been definitely deter
mined that the office shall go to J. M.
Standley, ex-Sheriff of Mendoclno Coun
ty, whose home is in TJkiah. While the
appointment may not be announced at

MONTH OF. SEPTEMBER
Frank *C. Deyae of Mehdodno County
secured ] a j decree of divorce from Annie
DeyoÂ© In the" Superior, Court. He asked
that the order be madÂ© final without fur
ther delay. His petition was > denied : and
he. appealed' to' the Supreme Court' for a
writ of mandamus to compel thÂ© Judge to
comply with, tilg' desires. In this way the
case .was advanced much more rapidly
than - by ordinary procedure. ThÂ© Su
preme. Court* has considered and rendered
an..oplnlon'^on the "matter .within three
months.- . Â¦ : . 'Â¦-- V:' . â¢ ;
PROVIDES AGAOTST EVASION.
The "interlocutory decree" 'divorce law
owes Its existence to the fact that the
publio had discovered a. way: of evading
the previous enactments." The old law
would not permit divorced .persons to
marry In this State for a. yeai\ after the
granting of a decree. People who wished
to-be married again Inside the time limit
took the. train to Reno, Nev., and had the
ceremony performed there. The Supreme
Court in the estate of Wood; held that
euch marriages were valid. The last Leg
islature was then i asked ( to , formulate a
statute^ which "would make, such evasions
of-the law impossible. . The/blll : passed in
accordance with, this purpose . provided
that decrees of divorce should not go into
effect until a year, from . the tlmÂ© of Judg
ment. This, of , course, did away ' with
Reno" marriages "within the- specified pe
riod. , v ...' Â¦:? , ' , - r v',./- ; -:./ ; --:
. Â¦ The principal argument against the new
law. was that It was class legislation. The
Supreme Court says. that It certainly Is a
special law regulating thÂ© practice of the
courts, but holds:that It Is not on that
account unconstitutional. It, is declared
to be the' right of the Legislature to reg
ulate marriages and divorces. A measure
which gives an . opportunity for a recon
ciliation between a husband and wife who
may be'separated is h,eld to be In perfect
accord. with the constitution.'
FINDS NO TECHNICAL ERROR.
Â¦ The appellant contends that the subject
of thÂ© act Is not expressed In the title;
Telying on the , Supreme .Court decision
which - invalidated .the codes nearly three
years ago. : The Justices assert that the
subject is properly expressed In the title. .;
The third and last argument of the ap
pellant is that the new divorce law should
This.. means jtfso that there can be no
Reno marriages within thÂ© tlmÂ© specified.
The' "Interlocutory decree" divorce law
was approved March 2, 1903. Immediately
thereafter.. there were many denunciations
of it. as class legislation. Superior Judges
of San Francisco and of several other
counties In thÂ© StatÂ© declared that the
provision . was . unconstitutional. n It was
decided by thÂ© legal fraternity to bring a
test case/ before the Supreme Court as
soon' as possible,', \
The> various Â¦; Superior Judges of the
State * who" have recently declared that
the , '"Interlocutory decree" divorce' law
passed by the. last Legislature was un
constitutional arÂ« mistaken, and thÂ© nu
merous people who went through wedding
ceremonies relying on such decisions are
riot legally married, according to an opin
ion" rendered by the seven Justices of the
Supreme Court yesterdaj'. Divorces can
not bÂ© made absolute until a year from
the time- of the rendering of theldeeree.

NOTED VISITORS PLEASED.
And now to the last and greatest of the ob
jections formerly urged. Distinguished .vis
itors have come and gone, the honored PrMl
dent of the United States has visited us. and
I have his own word that he enjoyed himself
immensely among us, and that his reception
In Ean Francisco. Including the welcome â¢ ex
tended by your labor Mayor on behalf of all
the people of this queen city of. California,
was second to none accorded him anywhere in
the United States.
Thus have been disposed of all the argu
ments against us except one which I have not
yet referred to and which I now propose to
meet boldly and firmly, for that, too, has been
disproved and has fallen away. It is the old
familiar cry that we are seeking to establish
a class government, and aa we shall undoubt
edly hear much of this In the next few weeks,
let us consider that suggestion for a moment,
for we owe it to the people, now as ever,
clearly to define our position and not to seek
or accept a single vote upon any false repre
sentation or pretense. t
In our former campaign I used the follow
ing language which I reaffirm now in every
particular and which I have conscientiously
endeavored by my every action to live up to
and effectuate. I have honestly endeavored
without fear or favor to represent the whole
people, and to give representation to every

pledge myself honestly and fairly to give equal
consideration and to show neither favoritism
nor prejudice for or against any. element or
class. I believe that in the peaceful union of
the wage-earner, and In his and
friendly affiliation with those who employ him.
lies the hope of the future welfare ot the
masses and the happiness and prosperity of
the community. I believe that the great
masses of the people should, in accordance with
their intelligence, their ability and their ca
pacity for fair and Just administration, have a
voice In the affairs of government and be rep*
reBented equally with the other large elements
of the community. There is certainly no more
reason why capitalist, merchant or employer
should hesitate to vote for a conscientious,
honorable and conservative employe than that
the employe should hesitate, under similar
conditions, to vote for the capitalist or em
ployer, as he has for years past been called
upon to do. . â¢ -
DOES NOT FAVOR CLASSES.
And our platform adopted this year contains
the following frank and open statement on this
subject, which I earnestly, and sincerely in
dorse: 1 '"iiiiilufc'illiniiiM'n i 7 1 j '
The Union Labor party Is not a class party,
and does not' Intend to establish a class gov
ernment. It is true that, . on account of pecu

without dissension, division or - faction. . Even
the petty differences of opinion expressed' in,
our late primary .election, exist no more. -â¢â¢Â¦':Â¦ .
And with -"us .will also, march to the polls
those thousands. upon thousands of our fellow
citizens who also believe with uÂ«s in the fair
and equal recognition of ; all elements -j? our
people, in the betterment of the social and in
dustrial condition of. the masses,- in -a govern
ment for the benefit of the many and' not for
the exclusive* interest of .' the few.
And all who are" gratified at the success of
the experiment * of '.two years ago, who" are
proud of the conservative, honest and business
like administration which we have given them,
notwithstanding .obstacles and interferences,
unsympathetic boards and commissions left by
our. predecessors In .'office, I and an , antagonistic

motto of success, "Equal rights to alland spe
cial privileges to none.". - Â¦â¢ - ' -- J

tlon of our. people, but it embraces and seeks
to comprehend in its membership ail elements
of our population,' Irrespective i- of class, creed
or station. It is essentially, the party of the
plain peopleâ the'party. of those who. are bene
fited by co-operation for the protection and
maintenance . of - their political 'rights. And
while it respects' and protects the rights of all,
it Is at the same. time designed to secure ef
fectively for the wage-earner, for the small
taxpayer, for the larger mass .of our-citizen
ship, the rights and privileges to .which un
der the law they are legitimately entitled, and
which heretofore have only too frequently been
enjoyed by the. few. ' â¢ ' ,
But the 'Democratic ' platform undertakes to
explain why the city- and .the charter; need

people; Gavin McNab.'; who controlled the nom
ination of the Democratic candidate for Mayor
as also-all other nominations on . the Demo

tion. Â¦ â¢ , Â¦. - . .
What do our â¢ opponents of .tho Republican
and Democratic parties say? t
.The Republican committees and the Repub
lican press . are* striving to create the very
ctasB distinctions which they formerly stated
their desire to avert. - They are calling upon
capitalist,- merchant,- manufacturer and em
ployer to organize* and to rally- to the Republi
can candidate' In order to preserve the Gov
ernment and Incidentally to .hold down . the
forces 'of labor. r They are apparently not sat-
Ufled with . the ' existing conditions of peace
and â¢ prosperity, j Their, platform 'ignores the
labor movement' In San , Francisco; they ex
cluded, so .far as It, was possible for them
so to do with the exception of a single'in
cumbent any man known to have â¢ union labor
affiliations and are evidently- welcoming a di
vision of the electors of this city on the very
class . lines to which ' their orators so j loudly
voiced ' unfounded objection' only ' a short time

to his pledge that he represents neither class,
creed nor station, but Is and Intends to be
the Mayor of the whole people and of every
class and element of the people; and it Is
based also upon the reepect which he pre
dicted would be created In the minds of all
our fellow-cltlzons when thry realized, that
self-reliance and ordinary business ability
could be found as well among our wage earn
ers es ftmons our bankers, merchant princes,
millionaires and attorneys at law.
' If re-elected I shall not only serve you and
the whole - people faithfully and zealously
with such ability and energy as I possess, but I
shall also endeavor to leave for future genera
tions the impress of the work which during my
term -we shall have done for their interest. If
I shall' serve a second term as Mayor I will
devote my whole time,. as heretofore, to the du
ties of the office and pledge you that substan
tial and permanent -results will accrue to the
city during my Incumbency. '

WOULD BEAUTIFY - CITY.
If the Droceeda of the bonds recently voted
for should become available prior to the expira
tion of my second term, of which from the pro.
verbial delays of the law I entertain much
doubt. I would see that the first work taken
up should be the erection of a City and County
Hospital for our indigent sick and the con
struction of new schoolhouses for the accom
modation of our children, who. rich and poor
alike, draw equal draughts of learning from our
great American public schools.
As a native of San Francisco I take great
pride. in her public Institutions and in her gov
ernmental administration. I wish to see the
city of my birth attain her destiny not only as
the mc^roDOlls-of the Pacific Slope, but If pos
sible also as the commercial metropolis of the
United- States. I wish to see her grow and
becom* adequate to her new responsibilities
and to be clothed and furnished with every
material, appliance necessary to maintain her
advancing splendor and greatness. I wish to
see her holding In her grasp me commerce of
the Pacific Ocean to the west and the great
American continent to the east, to the north
and to the south. I wish to see her arrayed
in' the glory of her . enterprise and of her
strength. . ; " . , '
I wish to see the new and greater. San Fran
cisco Â» thing of splendid reality and not al
ways' a pleasant but hazy, dream. 5 I should be
pleased to assist further in her development
and progress, and if re-elected to have my name
associated with a period of her greatest promise
and of , her greatest realization.
What can be done with a sympathetic board
may be seen in the work of the School Depart
ment during the past year and a half. That
board has acted In concert with me. and the re
sult Is that teachers are- now appointed on
merit alone and after a competitive examina
tion,'and not as the result of political Influ
ence or political favoritism.
This is a departure which of Itself Is a start
ling though most commendable Innovation. A
new schoolhouse ha* been built In Noe Valley:
new rooms have been added to old school
buildings, and more repairs and Improvements
have been' made in and about school premises
than In nny similar period of time in the de
partment's history.
The school buildings- never were In better
condition than they are now. but they are by
no means perfect yet. n
my vetoes, by which I twice endeavored to
save the city about $100,000 per year In use
less and extravagant salaries. In Oavln Me-
Nab's platform he falsely accuses me of be
ing controlled by corporations, notably the
Spring Valley Water Works. Not only Is
this an absolute He, but the consistency of
the statement la immediately apparent when
it Is recalled that the only part I ever took
In any matter involving the Spring Valley
Water Company was once, when the Supervisors
whom Mr. Gavin M&Nab has renominated
proposed to recommend an ordinance fixing
water rates greatly in excess of existing rates,
and I proposed a compromise rate far less in
amount than the majority of them were wil
ling to allow; and I wish to call especial at
tention to the fact that while under the law
the 'Mayor has absolutely no official power,
either of approval cr of veto In the matter
of fixing water rates, as has been decided by
the courts, and is only by courtesy permitted
a voice In the matter, as it may affect his
administration. Mr. Gavin McNalwhas re
nominated every Democratic Supervisor who
voted for the compromise measure and has by
thus indorsing them absolutely stultified the
declarations contained in his Democratic plat-
But enough of this. What crafty politicians
or self-seeking demagogues may say will In
this campaign cut but smaU figures. Our future
policy will be Judged by what we have accom
pllÂ«hed in the past. ,-â_,
Every pledge taken we have fulfilled to the
extent of our cower. Under the provisions of
the charter a Mayor must be elected twice be
fore he can effectively carry out any defined
policy. He cannot control the policy of the
administration during his first term, becauso
he is obliged to deal with- boards and com
missions of which a majority In each is left
over to him from his predecessor in office and
is as I have learned only too well, frequently
directly antagonistic to the Mayor's policy.
If I should be re-elected I will then for the
first time have majorities in the various com
missions sympathetic with my views and shall
be able to carry out with further success the
policies mapped out during the last campaign.
SCHOOLS ARE IMPROVED.

people? Are they not worthy of moat serious
thought and consideration? These conditions
are neither the accident of events, nor am I
so egotistic as to claim that thÂ«y are entirely
attributable to my own personality. They re
sult from the confidence and trust which the
masses of the people, the wage earners and
those who feel with them have in a representa
tive selected by themselves, one upon whom
they feel they can always rely for fair and Just
consideration, and that is all they askâ end
from the acquired confidence of those who deal
with them that In any event the Mayor â¢ of
the city has lived up -to and ever will live up
And even now. - when another far-reaching
and widespread strike is onâ one which I am
glad to say now also seems . on the eve of
peaceful settlement â I refer to the great tele
phone linemen's strikeâ the peace and quiet
which prevail are- so great that the very ex
istence of t lie industrial difference is scarcely
known or thought of by the great majority
of our people.
Could the- official representative of any other
party have done more? Should he have done
And it vras settled without policemen with
out bloodshed, without violence, even without
bad feeling, and to the undoubted eventual
benefit of both parties to the controversy, to
the approbation and satisfaction of all the peo
r-le and amid the approving plaudits of a
united press, a united pulpit and a united citi
zenship.
TWO STRIKES SETTLED.
Absence of violence in industrial disputes
may be no Just ground for claiming credit, for.
indeed, violence should never dÂ« a feature in
the disturbance <>f any labor condition, but un
fortunately under former administrations not
enly did violence and bloodshed attend such
disturbances, but they were- intensely the prime
features thereof â in many cases, if not in all,
created by outsiders, and in others perhaps re
sorted to in desperation and under extreme
provocation. Such attending circumstances al
ways were- and always will be a distinct detri
ment to the cause of labor, and a distinct detri
ment to the well being of the community In
which they occur. â¢ ."
During our last campaign I took occasion re
peatedly to say that in these matters as in all
ethers I deprecated violence and was in favor
of peaceful measures at all hazards, that I did
not believe in radical action, but favored con
servative, prudent and practical measures, ana
when occasion has arisen during my term of
office to put theea beliefs to the test I have
never failed to carry them out and have never
failed to have Uk result Justify the principle.
When before I had even fairly entered Into
office the most stronjjly organized and most far
reaching strike that ever occurred in Ean Fran
ci.Â«co confronted me. .1 refer, of course, to the
carmen's strike. I was In my official capacity
Jrx-e to face with a problem greater and morn
portentous than any cf similar character which
had ever been presented to a chief magistrate
cf this city. It involved the whole people di
reetly, es well as the men on strike, and the
large vested interests against which they were
contending for recognition of fair demands &
fair day's pay' for a fair day's work
Although no police have appeared on trucks
during my term of office â or on cars â although
no special permits to carry pistols have bÂ»en
given to men specially enlisted to make or pro
voka trouble when labor differences existed,
there has, since I assumed the Â»fflce of Mayor
of this city, been no bloodshed, violence or riot,
even where feelings ran highest and where the
tension was most strained.
ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION'.
In what administration has there been more
peaceful reconciliation of differences between
employer and employe? In what administra
tion has there been manifested more confidence
of satisfactory and peaceful adjustment on
terms both equitable and honorable to both
sides. During my administration I have been
called upon many, manr times to assist In the
settlement of industrial differences, euch as
are Inevitable wherever largo numbers of men
are- employed under distinct and separate em
ployments. Sometimes I have been appealed
to by the employe*, more often the employer
has nought my intervention, and I am proud
to say that on account of the good sense and
conservative disposition of the employe and the
fairness and good Judgment of the employer.
when conditions and Bltuations were properly
set before them. I have succeeded In every
case, great or small, without Intervening riot,
disorder or conflict in harmonizing and recon
ciling the existing differences to the satisfac
tion and advantage of both sides, and of more
importance than all, to the benefit, safety and
peace of the entire city.
Of what other administration can more, or
indeed as much, be said In this direction?
And as to strikes end labor difficulties, what
administration has been more- free from them?
Let us eee. During the last two years and
under the administration of a Union Labor
Mayor. Instead of decreasing 50 per cent, prop
erty values have In many sections of th<? city
Increased 50 per cent and more, 'and In no sec
tion has there been any lall whatever. (And no
real estate agent has yet left the town.) Not a
single bank has closed, new ones have estab
lished thems&lws and the bank clearings have
exceeded by millions nny ether two years of
the city's financial history, and they are to
day In better condition, doing more business
and making more money than ever before.
Instead of frightening away capital, mil
lions of dollars have been invested anj mil
lions more are seeking investment. More build-
Ing and Industrial activity exists, . and has
existed for the past year and a half, than
ever before known, showing trust and confUence
in existing conditions and f.-ith In the integ
rity, conservatism and ability of tho Union
Labor party administration.
Why, even the New York millionaire, who,
because of reported sympathy for the aspira
tions of the present Republican candidate for
Mayor caused to be obliterated a sign an
nouncing my present candidacy, put up by one
of my friends with his agent's consent. Is at
the very scene of that exploit, on the- summit
of Nob Hill, erecting a $1,000,000 hotel as a
tribute to his confidence in the good sense and
sterling Integrity of the plain people, not
withstanding his apparently outward opposi
tion to their candidate.
PROSPERITY OE CITY.

the applause was deafening. Men and

speech at the ratification meet-
Ing, of tee Union Labor party In the Al
.fcÂ«nbra. Theater last night. While the
attendance was not all that might have
'bee? desired by the committee In charge,
the enthusiasm of the audience made up
for what it lacked In numbers. There
were many empty chairs, but before the
meeting vas concluded most of these
were taken.
Mayor Schmltz -was accorded an ova
tion when he stepped upon the platform.
Throughout hla address he was Inter
rupted with hearty applause. He spoke
with great elncerlty and his periods were
punctuated with wild outbursts of enthu
siasm from his followers. The Mayor
apologized for reading his speech and
cald he was forced to do so. as It was the
opening gun of the campaign, and what
fee said might be distorted by those who
oppose his re-election.
In the audience were many ladles, who
applauded with as much fervor as their
escorts. -Mrs. Schmltz occupied a seat In
a -box and she felt proud of the reception
tendered her husband.
. Speeches were delivered by nearly all
the candidates, and their one appeal was
for the election of the entire ticket. All
those who appeared before the gathering
were applauded and cheered. The meeting
from beginning to conclusion was an en

take in the proper upbullilng aad drveleptsent
of ths new Bun Francisco.
l*t us modv-rnlie our city and make her up
to date. Let us have more children's play
grounds; more public parks; let us . have at
once the better \streets and sewers contemplated
by the recent bond election. Let us have the
city not only beautified, but practically and
endurlngly Improved.
I pledge myself to co-operate earnestly along
business lines, and, economically In the accom
plishment of this result.
And let us fcavn a municipal rovenuaent
liberal and broad zalnded In Its Ideas, though
businesslike and economical In Its administra
tion, according to everybody fair and generous
treatment under vrmry regulation and safe
guard of the law In every business and Indus
try which le brought Into contact with the
administration of the .municipality.
With our platform I *s>vor the expenditure
of more of the money raised by taxation for
permanent public Improvements aad for the re
pair and Improvement ct our streets and the
expenditure of less money for extravagant sal
aries or ornamental and unnecessary employes.
I favor also the acquisition and publlo owner
ship of publlo utilities. Including the acquisi
tion of a municipal water supply and the
Geary-street railway, and If any such should
be acquired during my term of office I pledge
myself to a businesslike, economical and hon
est administration thereof.
ENCOTJBA0rES TTNIOIT LABOB.
I am also In thorough sympathy with the pro
vision that, where practicable, all publlo sup
plies should bear the union label, believing
that such designation Is a Just recognition of
skilled free white labor, an Indorsement of
reasonable hours and fair wages and a guar
antee to the public that supplies furnished the
city are the product of skilled American work.
manshlp and honest worth and not an Impost
tlon of Chinese. Japanese, foreign cr peniten
tiary manufactures.
I also strongly and decidedly favor the pro
vision that goods of home manufacture be given
preference In all supplies for public Institu
tions of the city In the Interests of the manu
facturers and merchants of this city, who pay
our taxes and support our local government, aa
against foreign and external manufacturers
and merchants who take their profits hence
and contribute nothing to the support of our
government, our Institutions or our wage earn
ers.
The crying abuses of the publlo contract sys
tem and the despoiling of the municipal treas
ury by dishonest contractors who shirk their
work and with the connivance of a complais
ant Board of Supervisors show little result for
large expenditures f the publlo moneys, lead
to the demand In our platform that aU pub
llo work shall be done by the day.
This Insures fidelity aad better results. I
favor this plank for these reasons and also
because It will tend to the establishment of an
honest day's pay for aa honest day's work.
The money paid by the city will go Into the
homes of Its people. Instead of Into the capa
cious and rapacious pockets of the contractors
and the publlo will be better served. I agree
with the platform that the street sweeping
machines should be owned by the city.
In the matter of civil service, I will follow
the law, the^harter and the decision of the
courts as I have throughout xny term endeav
ored to do so.
As to Chinese and Japanese Immigration I
am thoroughly convinced that the best Inter
ests of our city and State demand the con
tinuance of the Chinese exclusion act and the
Inclusion within Its prohibition of all other
Asiatics and that Its provisions should be ex
tended to all territory within the Jurisdiction
of the United States. This Is In strict accord
ance with the party platform and Â¦ coincide*
with my own personal views on the subject. â¢
LIKES HOME BTJLE POLICY.
As also declared In the platform. I favor the
abolition of the poll tax. It is an unjust and
a disproporttonal tax.
I favor fair and liberal treatment of the
Fire and Police Departments, the efficiency,
courage and real of Whose members are known
throughout the entire country-
I am 'in entire accord with those provisions
of the platform of our party which read as
follows :
"We favor absolute home rule for the city
and county of San Francisco and pledge our
nominees and our party to work tÂ» that end.
"The interference by the Legislature with
the internal affairs of San Francisco, not
withstanding the charter, is costlnsc cur ctty
much meney and Is encroaching upon her rights
of self-government.
"We favor a constitutional amendment which
shall make It impossible for State Boards of
Equalization arbitrarily to raise tho assess
ment of this city, already over-asses*ed, es
pecially as regards Its smaller property holders.
"We also favor such changes In the laws as
will place the water front of San Francisco
under the control of the municipal government,
so that the administration of the water front
may be conducted more with a view to the
commercial advancement and prosperity of the
city than as an asylum for the political refu
gees of the State who are strangers to San
Francisco, not Interested In Its welfare and
ignorant of Its needs."
And I need cot sav that I thoroughly agree
with another provision _of the platform which
reads as follows: Â»
"We deplore the Interference by the courts
In the executive affairs of the city and the
abuse of the writ of Injunction to restrain the
action of public officials honestly attempting
to do their whole duty by the peoplo. and by
such Injunction enabling Incompetent or dis
honest mÂ«n to hold themselves In publlo posi
tion in defiance of the acts of their executive
cuperlors and of the will of the people."
A few words more and I shall have finished.
ThÂ» Union Labor party 'having no party organ
among the newspapers we shall be obliged o
rely on the fairness of the press as matters
of news to report our proceedings correctly,
and' If they do this we shall have no fault to
find with them even if their editorials are
colored by their self-interest or by their adopt
ed policies. .,- â "
If a newspaper refuses to support a labor
candidate because its proprietor la adverse to
the labor element In the community and the
fact Is known to the people its comments caa
do no harm. If another newspaper refuses to
support the same candidate because of its
proprietor's personal ambitions the same resu!Â£
will follow.
Still leas will fencfc comment Injure when.
as In the case of the Bulletin, which but
yesterday Insulted the- worklngmen of San
Francisco by likening. th*"lr party to a fallen
woman. It Is notorious that thÂ» longest sack
has the largest Influence over Its editorial col
umns, and when gloating over the proceeds
of its' own shame and sale It will support any
and every candidate who successfully reaches
Ita editorial pocket.
It Is advocating to-night thÂ» Democratic
candidate- for . Mayor. I would not bÂ« sur
prised, nor would anybody else be. If to-mor
row or next day It should support the Repub
lican candidate for â¢- slightly. higher price \r>
be paid by his friends and supporters Instead
of by the friends and supporters of his op
ponent.
The moral of the Bulletin Is measured -by
the sign of the dollar. I am tempted to say
more on this subject and to give some ex
tended detail. Perhaps I may do %o hereafter.
In conclusion I thank you for your atten
tion. I ask your suppdrt for our entire ticket
and promise you that If elected we shall seek
to Justify your confidence and | friendship â¢ and
will ever strive to maintain in thÂ» high place
to which we have elevated It in the esteem
and regard of the entire people the banner of
the Union labor party.

The game umpire was ufter the pesky
second l,nÂ«=emnn In n twinkling, but bt-rore
he reached his prey a special officer and
Â¦everaj plnyers Interfered and the battle
o<mÂ« to a close. Then the crowd surged
Od the Held and It looked like a free scrap
for the time being.
Wheeler Ftnrted the whole thing by call
ing the umpire pome uncomplimentary
name*. McDonald lfÂ» not the mnn to
ptaiKl for this kind nf thing and llko the*
fighter ho Is went over to nettle It.
Whfeeler got In his punch when Jim wub
.â¢it n flLtadvantage, otherwise he probably
t\<mlil have be*n given a good boating.
Thi fans were lorry McDunnld did not
have a rliance to get his man, for any
player who Is mean enough to call an um
pire names has a thrashing coming. Tho
score:
His only fault was his Inclination to be
wild. During thy game he passed six
men and many of these bases on bails
meant runs for the home players. Aside
fiom thin llttln transgression of tho
pitcher's etiquette the lnd was right and
bfl will easily make glfod.
When tha game wns all over and the
fans were rendy to depnrt Jim McDonald
pud(l< nly walked over In the direction ol
tli<> Ixs Angeles bench. He met Wheeler
iTrnr tht pla*"'? and mude a motion to tnko
ofr Ills mask. In the meantime Wheeler
lilt Jim u punch In the nose.
He showed a big nssortmenl of curve.*
nnd a nice Change of pace. His fast bnll
wus ulways effective and he never lobt
Ills head In tho tight place*. He watched
tho bajaes like an old leaguer and caught
iA'ahy off firpt on one occasion by many
feet.
Charley Iiaum. the Berkeley, boy, who
was elven a trial with Harris last year
nnd who has been pitching with an Ore
con team nil season, did the box Ptunt
for Morley. Ms (showing was crwlitnblo
end with nny kind of support he would
have won out in a canter.
The poor playing of the southern tenm
made the game the bent of the neries.
They handicapped themselves, so to
f-peak, and therefore the native toseera
hnd a chance. Then the home players
put up ft pretty good article of ball nnd
this also aided them In getting away with
the game by a single tally. , !
At last the wreath of victory crowns,
the head of Uncle Hank. All week he
has labored for this and now that it has
arrived no one cares by what 'means lus
secured it. The victory did not come by
fair m'Niis as far ns the work of the Na
tives was concerned, but , rather by .tho
way the Angels performed. In addition
to a native victory the "fanatics were
treated to a little fistic encounter be
tween Jim McDonald and Wheeler, so
cvftry one went away contented. Score,

BOSTON, Oct 3.â For a time this after
noon it looked as if the third game of the
Plttsburg National-Boston American post
season series could, not be played on ac
count of the great crowd that Jiwarmed
Into the Huntlngton avenue grounds. An
hcur before tho game was scheduled to
begin there were 15,000 people inside the
grounds, and standing room writ at a pre
mium. Still people came pouring In, and
finally, at 2:30 o'clock, the sale of tickets
was stopped after 1S.301 had been sold.
This number is the largest that over at
tended a ball game in Boston. Men stood
fifteen rows deep around the diamond, the
roof of the pavilion was thronged and
every Inch of space on the fence sur
rounding tho grounds was occupied. Thou
sands of men and boys clambered over
the fence, and at least 25,000 people were
inside when the game began. Tho force
of fifty policemen was totally Inadequate,
and at 2:30 o'clock a hurry call was sent
for a hundred more men. At that time
the crowd had broken down the . ropes
end a number of women were caught in
the crush 'and roughly used. Some of the
players plunged Into the mob and helped
these women to safe places. . The teams
were unable to indulge in practice, but
when the extra police arrived clubs were
drawn and tho crowd ,was forced back
from the diamond. The ground hose was
manned by some policemen, and using
this as a whip the spectators were forced
back. \ During the game the spectators
broke in on the diamond once, but the po
lice used the hose with good effect and
hustled them back.
Philllppi pitched another superb game.
Hughes of the Bostons was knocked out
of the box in the third Inning:. Young,
who succeeded him. was effective, but

It Is a foregone conclusion that Berkeley
Is going to force a kicking game when the
two elevens meet next month. .With the
ginnt Overall lifting the pigskin fifty and
6lxty yards will be made at a time and
upon every exchange of punts Berkeley
Is bound to gkln from ton to twenty
yards. If the blue and gt)ld cannot force
COMPARISON OF TEAMS.
It Is In strength of line and ut tho punt
in* game that tho cardinal shown its
weakness*. The line men arc light and un
steady Hauvcrman at center is the only
veteran player among them. The ends
are not euro in getting down on their man
when a point is made. Unless tho line
men can open up holes In Berkeley's vet
eran line the cardinal's hurricane backs
cannot make their gains when It comes to
tho big game. In punting no one at Palo
Alto can lift the ball farther than forty
flve yards nt the moot.
On the other hand, Reliance did not put
up Its game by a fur cry.' Cavanuugh,
the big center, was crippled by a iume
shoulder; Captain Atkinson at fullback
was not In sorts and the capacity for
ground-gaining bucks and punts was ma
terially weakened by the absence of
Geisslcr at left half. George J. Macdon
ough, an old Berkeley player; who went
Info the game at left tackle, had both
i'miihh of ills leg broken during a scrlm
mngo in tho second half of the game. and
had to be carried to tho students' hos
pital.
Despite tho fact that some of the strong
college player* were withdrawn In the
game Stanford began tho second half
with tho bull on Reliance's thirty-five,
yard line and nont it through the guards
and tnckles for thirty yards In consecu
tive bucks. Then acting under the provis
ions of the new rulcn, Dansbach, quar
terback, tucked tho oval under his arm
tit tho thirty-yard lino and skirted the
Reliance end for a touchdown.
Stanford's second game With Rellanco
made evident the fact that in the brothers
Dole, with Tarpcy and WÂ«ller. tho big
freshman, the cardinal has a quartet of
backs to pick from which have not been
equaled since Percy Hull nnd "Locomo
tive" Hmith played behind Derkeley's line.
With the exception of Welter they all hit
the line low, and all, including the fresh
man, hit it llko a bullet. On the defense
they back up the somewhat wobbly lino
in great Bhnpe. â¢
PLAYER SUFFERS ACCIDENT,
B-â â Y as pretty and clean a victory
ji9 lias ever been scored, the
Stanford varsity eleven brought
defeat to the Rellanco football
tram yesterday on their cam
pus by the "scorn of 6 to 0.
"When the chance for a score by either
side seemed to have gono a-gllmmerlng
and only a scant ten mlnutP3 of play re
mnlned, Bransbach, the heady little cap
tain and quarterback of tho cardinal
eleven, dnBhed around the clubmen's
rlnht end tor the goal posts. Goschen, tho
nimble-footed loft end of tho Reliance,
made a burst of speed In an effort to
flown the runner and save defeat, but he
foil short. The yells from tho bleachers
told that the pigskin was safely behind
the last white line. Sprott kicked an easy
rorI and the six points were scored
against the clubmen.
The game was a great surprise. The In
vincible line which Reliance had present
ed to Stanford two weeks ago and to
Berkeley la.*Â«t Saturday wan crumpled up
and torn for gain after gain. Stanford's
line, which has been considered the vul
nerable point of the team, allowed Ro
ll&nce to gain Its distuneÂ© on bucks only
three times during the entire game. The
aggregation of eleven men in curdintTI
who had plRyetl without team work two
weeks ugo worked together like a pleco
of machinery yesterday. They \4&vtz
Bteady and quick.

Whenever a sore or ulcer is ' slow in healing then you may be sure
something is radically wrong with your blood. Some old taint or poison
that has been slumbering there for years, is beginning to assert itself,
"and breaks out and becomes a bad ulcer and perhaps the beginning of
Cancer. 1 These old sores are rooted in the blood, and while washes, soaps,
salves, etc., keep the surface clean, they are not healing. A blood

it, and ulcers of every kind quickly yield to its wonderful curative prop-,

of nature's reserve power through mistakes of youth. You need not suffer for this. You can be restored. The very element which
you have lost you can get back, and you may be as happy as any man that lives.

UNION LABOR CENTRAL CLUB.
I We are told that there Is a united Republi
can party. We have also been recently ln-
I formed that there is a harmonious Democracy.
(Laughter.) Well, I am not certain that there
is a united Republican party. I don't believe
that the party of Lincoln, of Garfleld. of Me-
Klnley and of Roosevelt has united on a man
standing for what Henry J. Crocker stands for
In this campaign. (Applause.) And I don't
think you believe it. (Applause.) And t am
equally certain that there Is not a harmonious
Democracy. I think 1 know something of the
IXrnocratlc party. My first vote, my evpry
I vote has been cast for the Democratic Presi-
I dential electors. I know what Democratic prln
i clples are and I know what the Democratic
party has stood for in the upDuilding of our
pood country, the fairest and best country on
the face of God's green rarth to-day. (Ap
plause.) And I know that the Democratic party
of San Francmco Is not and never will be har
m6nlcus under the domination of Gavin Mc-
Xab The Democratic party of San. Francisco
! don"t like the tones of his music, and I don't
! wonder at It. There Is no harmony In the
â¢ Democratic household, and I never could hear
I any harmony in the eo-called music of the bag
! pipes. (Applause.)
Dr. . John. F. Dillon, candidate for Cor
oner, delivered an excellent speech. His
remarks were witty and he held his audi
tors by the skill with which he discussed
ther issues of the campaign. Addresses
were made by Powel Fredrick, candidate
for County Clerk; Miles L. Farland, can
didate for Tax Collector; William G.
Burke, candidate for City Attorney, and
: many of the Supervisorial candidates.
Â¦ There was also singing by the Pierce
quintet, and the meeting concluded with
! cheers for Mayor Schmitz and the rest
| of the ticket.
Disguise It as they may. the conflict is on
and as was broadly stated by one of the. little
coterie controlling the Republican organization
of this city, this is . a proper time to array
capital asrainst labor. If the friends of labor,
if tho laboring men. if the citizen who values
peace In this community, ever needed to be
vigilant, he needs It now. Be alert, be vigi
lant, the rumbling of the battle Is heard In
the distance. Capital â aggressive, soulless
capital is thoroughly organized.' Its plots are
deeply ' laid. It has unlimited resources at
command. Its forces are In battle array and
am marching on proudly and defiantly to the
victory which it think* Is theirs. At the head
of this attacking force is the millionaire
Crocker, the candidate of -the Employers' As
sociation, and every "enemy of labor is march
ing on; on our flank are the Hessians. McXab

interest of all the clacces of San Francisco,'
by the election of a union labor Mayor two
short years ago. (Applause.)
This campaign, which we open here to-night.
Is the most important one In the history of
San Francisco, for by your votes you must
determine one. month from to-day whether
organized labor,, whether this entire commu
nity will continue In lta onward course, ' or
whether we shall at this time take a backward
step. You must determine whether the pres
ent peaceful industrial conditions shall pre
vail, whether that prosperity shall continue
which our Golden Gated city has been blessed
with for the last two years, or whether we
will be again confronted with those alarming
and damaging conditions which prevailed dur
ing the closing days of the McXab-Phelan
reign. (Applause and hoots.)

THE beautiful series of art reproductions,
in color, now being given free as a sup-
I plement to The Sunday Call, will be
materially enhanced in value by the addition of
the magnificent picture to be distributed next
Sunday.
This beautiful picture is the work of the
eminent German artist, Adolph Schreyer, and
is called "The Arab Scout."
THE ARAB SCOUT.
This title, which has been given to many of the pictures of Al-
gerian horsemen painted bv Adolph Schreyer. was never better ap-
plied than to the one which furnishes the subject of; The Call Art
Supplement.
The alert and cautious attitode of the rider and the careful man-
ner in which the horse is shown picking his way through a trackless
waste suggest forcibly that they are on uncertain ground, where un-
seen foes may be met at any moment.
Schreyer was a romanticist. He seemed to regard the horse with
much the same love and respect that the Arabs bestow upon what they
consider God's most precious gift to man.
He also surrounded the Arab with a glamour of romance. The
free adventure of their nomadic lives, their skill in horsemanship and
the use of firearms, the wealth of color and ornament in their cos-
tumes and trappings for their steeds are dwelt upon in his pictures
< with a fond attention which indicates an absorbing interest in them.
Few painters have adhered to a class of subjects â one might say
a s-ntjle subject â as closely as Schreyer.
In his earlv life he painted some scenes in which Wallachian team-
sters or field artillerv of various armies played a prominent part, but
vhen He hz<*- once become familiar with Arabs and their horses he
rarely attempted to paint other subjects.
Adolph Schrever was born in Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1828. He
studied drawine in the Stadel Institute in that city and studied horses
in a riding school. Later he pursued his art studies in Stuttgart.
Munich and Dusseldorf.
In 184S he traveled through Hungary. Wallachia and the land of
the Cossacks with the Prince of Thurn and Taxis.
He accompanied the Austrian army on its march through the
Par.ubian provinces in i8>i. and in 1856 traveled through Syria and
Egym.
In iRfo he visited Aleiers. and from that year until 1870 he re-
sided in Paris. In that rear he went to Kronberg. near Frankfort,
and nntfl his death he divided his time between. that place and Paris.
He received honors in many European exhibitions and is repre-
sented in many oublic galleries. He was a member of the Academies
of Antwerp and Rotterdam: was court painter to the Grand Duke of
Mecklenburg: was Chevalier of t4ie Order of Leopold.
In America his work has been immensely popular. Scarcely a
tvsWic or private collection of any importance is without one or sev-
eral n{ his paintines.
The Vanderbilt. Catherine Wolf. William Astor. August Belmont.
S'ebbins. Drexel. Walters. Morgan. Huntington, Butler and Rocke-
feller collections are a few in which he was. or is, represented bv im-
portant works.
The Chicago Art Institute possesses a most admirable example in
"Horses Fleeinefrom a Burning Stable." in the Munger collection
and Call readers will soon have this beautiful picture free as usual. "

After th!a train bad passed tha logs
were replaced by the vandals, evidently
with the Intention of wrecking tho pas
senger train which left Astoria at 7
o"clock this morning. Again the- work
t>f the wreckers was discovered.
It is believed soldiers stationed at Fort
Stevens are resiKmsible for the act or
vandalism, and uu Investigation la being
conducted, as a collision with a pile of
logs would have derailed a train and
doubtless resulted In loss of life. Ar
rests may be made to-morrow.

ASTORIA. Cr., Oct. 3.â Two attempts

At New Astoria obstructions were
placed on the track last night In an ef
tort to wrÂ«H-k a rock train, logs and old
lumber having been piled as high as ;i
man's head. The rock trains backed
down to the Government Jetty for a dis
tance of several miles and the brakeman
happened to be on the first car, thereby
Â» tuning the obstruction in tlma to pre
vent a collision.

CANAL TREATY
IS STILL ALIVE
Colombian Senate's Ac
tion Upon Conven
tion Not Final.
Lower House May Adopt It
and Send It Back for
Reconsideration.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON. Oct. 3.â President
Roosevelt has not abandoned tho Panama
canal project, nor will he do so until he
has taken reasonable time to learn wheth
er It Is useless to negotiate further with
Colombia or If It Is necessary to turn to
Nicaragua. He will report the situation
to Congress in his annual message, giving
hla reasons for awaiting the final deter
mination of the Colombian Government.
Confidential information from Minister
Beaupre at Bogota. Is said to be more en
couraging than the dispatches which have
been made public. The canal treaty has
not been rejected by the Colombian Con
gress, but only by the Senate. The whole
Congress must act on the treaty, and the
House has not yet considered it. The
treaty la therefore still before the Colom
bian Government and In much the position
of a treaty which has been disapproved
by the Senate Committee on Foreign Re
lations here, but which has not been
taken up by the Senate. It can be taken
up by the Colombian House, adopted and
then sent to the Senate again, or it can
be held until a new Congress la elected
without Invalidating It.
It can be said that the Cabinet and the
Isthmian Canal Commission fully approve
of the President's course in not hastily
turning from Colombia to Nicaragua for
concessions. The Attorney General has
given very careful consideration to the
whole canal situation and has advised the
President that there are several alterna
tives which may be adopted.
BOGOTA. Colombia, Oct 2 (via Buena
Ventura, Oct. 3).â The report on the bill
authorizing "the President to negotiate a
new canal treaty with the United States
will be presented to-morrow. Represent
ative Deroux opposed closing the ses
sions of Congress, arguing that adjourn
ing before the canal question is decided
would endanger the national Integrity.
The majority of the representatives ap
proved his stand.
Woman Drinks Acid.
Mary O. LJvaa, better known on the
Barbary Coast as May Brown, attempted
to kill herself by drinking carbolic acia
in a Paciflc-street dance hall last night.
She had had a quarrel with her consort,
and, determined to end her life, went out
and procured the deadly potion. Return-
Ing to the dance hall she placed the bot
tle against her lips and was about to
swallow the contents when her consort.
H. Hofmelster, seized her and with the
assistance of a friend took the bottle from
her. As she had succeeded In gulping
down a small quantity of the add, she
was taken to the Harbor Hospital, but
the surgeons In charge do not anticipate
any serious results.

Guy T* Butler. When the case was called
before Judge Cook yesterday morning As
sistant District Attorney Porter Ashe
made a motion that it be taken from the
calendar to be replaced when occasion de
manded. The Judge granted the motion.
Ashe has written authority from Butler
to represent him In the divorce proceed
ings, but as the letter contains matters
of a private nature and it would be- nec
essary to spread it upon the court rec
ords, it was deemed advisable to ask But
ler, who is in San Antonio, Tex., to send
Ashe a simple authorization and have the
seal of a notary atached to it. That
was the reason for Ashe's motion. This
was deemed the quickest way out of the
difficulty, as it will only take a few days
to get the necessary authorization.
It is the general opinion that the di
vorce will be granted, as desertion has
been proved and there seems to be no
doubt as to the question of residence.

The merchants have represented to the
Mayor that they are much Interested In
the administration's moves and are anx
ious to give every support possible to the
plans that shall be adopted.
The particular problem In hand is that
of public street sweeping. The city offi
cials are not satisfied with the old fash
ioned brush machine methods, and much
favor is shown the continuous daytime
hand plan, in use in San Francisco.
The Board of Public Works has com
menced experiments and purposes to car
ry on Its effort, according to the Com
missioners, until a system, metropolitan
and effective, has been evolved. All this
Is In line with the general movement to
ward better conditions that the present
municipal administration has In hand.
The Mayor and his fellow. Commission
ers are a harmonious body and have the
co-operation of the City Council.
"Though the city government Is ham
pered much by the lack of sufficient
money to Co that which we would much
like to Inaugurate," said Mayor Olney to
day, "there la a stimulating Influence that
can ba exercised that will, I have no
doubt, bring about many needed public
Improvements. We need to put on a new
suit of clothes and to show what we have
here. We need to make the utmost of
our splendid natural advantages. Civic
betterment, both in government and In
results therefrom, is the present day de
mands. If mv voice and pen. with the
warm co-operation of my fellow officials,
will accomplish anything in stirring our
people I shall feel that my service has
not been lost."
Mayor Warren Olney's crusade for the
betterment of Oakland's thoroughfares
has received the official Indorsement of
the Merchants' Exchange, which has come
to the front with a request to tho Board
of Public Works that the exchange shall
be kept In close touch with the movement
for "Cleanest Oakland."

Miss Kavanaugh came to California In
the summer on a sketching tour and
while In Oakland has been the guest of
her aunt, Mrs. E. C. Hagar. The young
artist's work has been much admired and,
acceding to repeated requests, she has
consented to exhibit a number of Cali
fornia scenes and portraits of well known
people which she has done since her stay
on the coast. Miss Kavanaugh Is excep
tionally clever In figure work and por
traiture. Among the bits of art that will
be on display Is a water color sketch of
Miss Louise linear, which Is not only an
excellent likeness but shows at once a
daintiness and strength in handling that
la unusual.

The office of Dr. Charles J. McCarthy,
2397 Mission street, where the deceased
had repaired for the extraction of several
teeth, was the scene of the distressing
affair. Waugh, accompanied by Dr. F. S.
Emmal of 2663 Howard street, went to Dr.
McCarthy's office shortly after 7 o'clock.
After all the necessary arrangements had
been made tha unfortunate man Beated
himself in the chair and Dr. Emmal ad
ministered chloroform. He had hardly
got under the influence when the physi
cian noticed that^lhe heart action was
very feeble, and Drs. Hughes and Austin
were summoned. Before their arrival
death had ensued.
The Coroner's office was notified and
Dr. Leland allowed tho body to be taken
home. Ho will make a personal Investi
gation and determine whether an inquest
should be held. Deceased was 43 years
of age and resided with his family at
Twenty-fourth and Chattanooga streets.
Dr. McCarthy, In discussing the matter
last evening, said that Dr. Emmal was
a personal friend of the deceased for
many years and had administered chloro
form to him on another occasion without
any ill effects. According to the dentist,
the dead man was only partially under
the influence when he succumbed and no
attempt had been made to extract any
teeth.
While in a dentist's chair last night, In
a partial state of anaesthesia Induced by
the administration of chloroform, II. H.
Waugh, a druggist employed in the drug
store conducted by Dr. Hughes at Twen
ty-fourth and Church streets, was 1 pre
sumably overcome by the drug and the
united efforts of several physicians failed
to savo his life.

LONDON, Oct. 3.â Prime Minister Bal
four has no cosy taak in selecting a suc
cessor to Sir Michael Herbert as Brit
ish Embassador to Washington. It so
happens that all of the eminent men now
on foreign embassies are near the age of
retirement and it is desired to avoid, if
possible, tho making of an appointment
for a comparatively brief term.
It has boen suggested that Ix>rd Cur
ton, Viceroy of India, who married Miss
Loiter of Chicago, possesses some of the
advantages which led to the selection of
Sir Michael Herbert as British Embassa
dor to Washjngton. Furthermore, it is
believed that the Government would not
be Unwilling to replace Lord Curzon In
India, One of tho chief criticisms of his
administration of tho Government of that
country, however, has been his utter lack
of democratic qualities, which would
hardly be a recommendation for the
Washington post. The chances are in
favor of the 'selection of one of the
younger and more promising men in the
diplomatic service

And now barken to a few other special features, which can oalv be
mentioned in brief because there are so many good things b the nex*
Sunday Call.
First, the ."Me-ows of a Kitty" (are you watcnins: those ca*3*V

which will tell you things about the Bonanza Kings of the West that wm
didn't know before, and. oh. ever so many things besides.
Jhst watch for the pictures.
Then there is a Daee of "Half-Hour Storiettes." which treats the
problem from quite a different point of view. There you have four of
the cleverest and most touching romances ever written. '*The Voice and
the Violin" especially and "The Grammar of Love" as well, which is a
story that you will never forget '
Then there is one of Frank H. Spearman's wonderful two-pag*
railroad stories. "De Molav Four." which, if you read it (and of course
you will), will constantly recur to your. mind with a strange thrill ever*
time you see the moon. Why? Because Frank H. SpÂ«arrnan wrote i*
and the moon wouldn't be in it if it were not dramatic.
â¢ *'A woman who refuses to obey might please her fancy bv the mere
declination to follow a custom, yet she might be the quickest to obey
her husband.
"That is where nature is stronger than ideas. Ideas may become
fads, existing for a short while, but nature goes right on.
"I notice that men are triad to get the women they want to mamr
and \the women are equally glad to marry, obey or not. regardless of all
fads land fancies." â
There are so many who differ with the reverend father that what
they have to say forms one of the most interesting pages in the next
Sunday CalL
It is almost that verv same quality of circumstance that forms the
theme of Robert Barr's srreat romantic story. The Kinz Icvesttsates,**
and by perhaps a strange coincidence the problem is solved in a novel
way in the fourth and last installment of E. \V. Townsend's latest and
best novel, "Lees and Leaven." which will appear next Sundav. The
famous creator of "Chimmie Fadden" has made a bis sensation since ap-
pearing as a writer in the Sunday CalL
is still unmarried and her action has set the East by the ears. In
the discussion pro and con (and it is truly Temarkable what stand
the women have taken) Father John Talbot Smith of the Catholic
church was appealed to. He haa given his dictum in no uncertain words.
"To tell the truth." he said. "I do not think it is a practical ques-
tion at all. this one of eliminating the word obey. It is in the nature of
things that the man should command and woman should obev. no mat-
ter how many statutory provisions you make, simply because a man likes
to command and a woman likes to obey.
"What is the vise of statutes against a natural proclivity or condition?

ritual

CHICAGO. Oct. 3.â WltM the opening sales
wheat prices started In a downward .direction
and the decline continued throughout the en
tire session. The opening -was bantly steady
on rather indifferent cables. December being
unchanged to a shade higher at 783 B @78%c.
Local houses with St. Louis connections had
selling orders from the start, and added to
this was the break of nearly 2c ln the De
cember price ln St. Louis. One or two of
the big houses here were on the belling side
early and this started a general liquidation
and values declined rapidly. One of the chief
factors in creating the bearish sentiment was
the large primary receipts, those at 8t. Louis
showing the greatest gain. There was little
demand at any time tn the - session and the
volume of trading was small. Closing prices
were at about the bottom figures, final figures
on December being lÂ®l',4o lower at 77 1 /4@77%c.
Extremely favorable weather throughout the
corn belt, together with the weakness ln wheat,
were responsible for lower prices ln corn.
December closed lc lower at 44Â«ic. Local re
ceipts were 300 cars, with forty-six of contract
trade. *
The weskness in wheat and corn was the
principal factor in bringing out free selling of
oats by discouraged longs and prices slumped
accordingly. The close was weak, with De
cember down %Â®%c at 35%@35%c. ,
There was little doing In the provision pit
and prices were easier, in sympathy with the
lower groin prices. January pork closed at
a loss of 7%e at $12 45, January lard was off
2V,c at it 8T%, and ribs down 2&@5c at

Washington Crop Bulletin
The report of G. N. Salisbury, section di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for the
Washington Crop Bulletin, week euded Sep
tember 2S. Is ta follows:
"There were light rhowors in the eastern
counties during the first part of the week,
which were not sufficient to interrupt farm
ing ooeratlons. There were hÂ«avy rains at
the same period in the Puget Sound btsin. and
during the entire week the rains were heavy
ln the co&ft counties. Thousands of bushels
cf oate^ standing in shocks, were wet ln Che
fcalig County, and considerable in the Round
country. The oats will be discolored, if not
more badly damaged. High winds occurred
on Beveral days, blowing oil a good deal of
fruit.
"In the "eastern counties the weather was.
en the whole, very favorable for wheat harvest
ing. Cutting is finished, stacking done and
threshing :> about three-fourths or more done,
except m the latest localities. Much of the
crop h&E been hauled to the warehouses. Po
tato digging progressed ln districts where- the
rain waÂ« not too heavy. Considerable blight
and core r&t are reported from coast and
sound localities. Hop picking is completed in
th? TaJdma yards and ln the smaller yards of
the western counties. Rain has freatly In
terrupted picking, and" has somewhat injured
the crop. Mold Is reported by some. Sugar
beets are now being gathered Sn Spokane
County. The yield ix good and the test shows
* biÂ«h percentage of 'tugar. Conditions have
not been good for saving the eecond crop of
clover ana much of it is badly damaged.
"Pastures and ranges have been greatly Im
proved by the rains. The moisture has been
beneficial to root crops and to Lite apples.
Th? ac:>ie crop will bo considerably larger ln
consequence. Fall wheat that was pown dur
ing the rains of the early part of the month
is up and growing nicety. Much needing has
been done, although the rround In some places
ie rather dry. Altogether the conditions are
unusually favorable for fall wheat.
"Briefly summarizing the results of the sea.
Bon, we note that the yield of winter wheat,
on account of poor stand, from unfavorable
ronCitions last fall, was only two-thirds of
the average, but of good quality. Barley,
r.<-ar the foothills of the Blue Mountains, was
a cood croi> of excellent quality. Oats were
"r.iy a fair crop In the eastern oour.Uen, but
heavy Sn the weFtern counties, although some
what damaged near the coaft by excessive
raine. Spring wheat, owing to a very back
ward fining and a ehortage of mature dur
ing the growing season, yielded only one-half
to three-fourthfi of a crop, according to local
liy find cultivation, but the wheat was of high
grade. Hops are of fair quality and some
tvhal below the average yield. The hay crop
Â»fcs a good one. of fine quality."

The Fruit market was fairly active, as re
tailers were stocking up for the Sunday trade,
but supplies of all descriptions were ample
and as a rule prices were no higher. Apples
were a leading feature and well packed, highly
Â¦colored offerings were ln brisk demand at full
figures, with occasional sales of exceptionally
fine stock reported at a premium over the
quoted rates. Common Apples were abundant
and dull. Bartlett Pears were ln limited sup
ply and steady. Peaches were ln free supply
and weak and It was difficult to obtain more
tlian 40c per box for the general run of offer-
Ings. A considerable quantity of open boxes
came ln late In the day from Santa Clara and
there was quite a surplus unsold at the close.
The other tree fruits stood about as previous
ly quoted, supplies of all kinds being anrple.
There was an abundance of all varieties of
table Grapes .except Seedless, the season for
which is about over. Prices of crate stock
ranged a little higher under a limited Inquiry
for shipment north on the sound steamer, but
the general run of offerings sold to the local
trade at 60@00c per crate. Wine Grapes were
quiet, with prices unsettled. Some sales were
reported at $24@25 per ton, but there were
about twenty cars on the track and buyers
were holding off In expectation of lower
pHces. Nutmeg Melons and Watermelons were
offering freely and were quiet at previous
prices. Cantaloupes were in small supply and
quoted higher. Citrus and Tropical Fruits had
nj noteworthy change.
Choice lots of Berries were in fair request,
but the market was overloaded with poor
stock. A large portion of the receipts of Ma
linda Strawberries went to peddlera at the
minimum quotation and the canners secured
quite a quantity of Raspberries at the inside
rate. Coos Bay Cranberries were offering at
lower rates and moved slowly. Cape Cod lots
were offering at previous prices and the de
mand was nothing extra.

CORN â The market continues quiet at pre
vious prices. Arrivals from the West have
fallen off during the past week.
The Chicago letter of Bolton, de Ruyter &
Co. says: "The market Is heavy and lower.
Country offerings are still small and the ship
ping demand fairly good, but the market is
evidently adjusting Itself to a new state of
conditions. While last year's crop was large,
exhausted reserves maintain the. price around
60c per bushel. With a fair crop this year It
looks as If prices were shaping for an adjust
ment around a lower level. . Out of the large
crop of last year the country must still have
considerable reserve of corn. Owing to the
sharp recent decline ln the market they are
holding It back: It Is a question of time,
however, when they must adjust themselves
to ruling conditions and the marketing of
corn must become free. We think corn should
also be sold on the rallies, but to avoid the
possibility of small stocks and consequent ma
nipulation we would sell the May In preference
to the December."

WHEAT â Foreign futures were firmer, but
there was no noteworthy news from abroad.
In this market, which Is quiet and weak,
quotations for both cash grain and futures
were lower.
The Chicago letter of Bolton. de Ruyter &
Co. said: "The market' -Is heavy and about
1 cent lower. The strength .noticeable the
past few days has spent its effect. It came
largely from a frightened short Interest. There
was nothing, and Is nothing so far aa we can
see, to Justify these fears. We are Inclined to
the view that there are many bullish factors
which will some, time manifest their effects.
Yet for the next few weeks the load which
speculators must carry ' Is certain to increase
rapidly. Every temporary rally puts us out
of line with foreign markets, which do not
follow us. There is no reason why they .should
follow, because other exporting countries are
supplying them freely with wheat: Every dip
ln this market to a lower point adds our of
ferings of wheat to foreign markets and in
creases the selling pressure. The congested
condition for the December delivery ln St.
Louis has put us about on a shipping basis
to that market and has driven whatever mill
ing demand there Is for No. 2 red wheat to
this market. It is not very great. We are
inclined to the view that St. Louis, as well as
this and other markets, must sooner or later
come to the question of supply and demand,
and that with their prices bo greatly out of
line, they will get all the No. 2 red wheat
they care to buy. We would sell wheat en the
rallies."

When this became known to the crimps
they vowed vengeance and swore that
the men should never be shipped unless
advance money was paid. They collected
around tho office of the Consul, and when
Captain McMillan appeared on the side
walk grew loud in their utterances, and
one of them,- Neuman by name, muttered
in an ugly way to the captain. "If you go
on any further trying to ship your own
crew perhaps before the Nivelle leaves
port she will need a new master."
Captain McMillan has been going to sea
for many years, and Is not the kind of a
man to be Intimidated by threats. He or
dered the new crew ro be at Meiggs
wharf at 8 o'clock yesterday morning,
where they would find Crowley's launch
ready to take them off to the bark, which
is lying in the lower bay ready to sail
north. The crew, bag and baggage, were
there at the appointed hour, but their ar
rival had already been anticipated by the
crimps, who were there in big force to
head them off and prevent them from go-
Ing aboard the launch. For two hours
the wrangle went on. First the crimps
tried to get the crew drunk, then they
used threats and finally succeeded in get
ting three of the men to say they would
quit. At this Juncture Captain McMillan,
accompanied by his wife, came ashore
from his craft. He was received with a
storm of abuse. As he climbed up to the
wharf he was surrounded by the crimps,
who made threats against him. One of
the chief Instigators randished a re
volver and another pulktl a lighted cigar
from his -mouth and smashed it into the
captain's face. One of the crimps yelled
out that the captain gave the crew noth
ing to eat, and that the last time he came
into port on the bow of his vessel was
printed in big letters the word "starva
tion."
In the midst of the excitement the
sailors were hauled' and mauled about,
and finally when the crimps saw they had
the worst end of the argument one of
them gave one of the sailors a terrific
blow that knocked him off the dock, and
he fell head foremost on the deck of th*
launch. This put an end to the fight for
the time being, and the crew were safely
put aboard the bark, while the captain
went up town. He was barely gone
when one of the crimps went aboard and
offered the sailors $20 each to go ashore
with him. The mate sprang forward, and
drawing his pistol ordered the crimp off
the bark.
Captain McMillan needs ten more men,
but how he is to get them is a puzzle.
Consul Bennett Is greatly worked up
over the affair, and if any further inter
ference Is shown he intends using strin
gent measures to protect the men under
his jurisdiction.
cause of the rumpus was the re
fusal of the bark's master, Captain Mc-
Millan, to pay the money demanded by
thÂ© boarding-house keepers for furnish
ing a crew for his vessel. The Nivelle has
been lying In the bay for the last fifteen
months awaiting a charter* Last week
she w%s chartered to load In Puget Sound
with lumber destined for Cape Town at 45
shillings per thousand. Captain McMil
i Ian at once commenced fitting out for the
voyage. "vVhen he came to getting his
crew he found that for each of the twen
ty-two men required to fill out his ves
sel's complement tho crimps demanded
$61. He deemed this an unreasonable
amount of advance money and deter
mined to engage a crew of his own choos
ing, leaving the crimps entirely out of the
question. With this end in view he sought
British Consul Bennett, who had under
his protection twelve of the crew of* the
British bark Wemyas Bay, recently
wrecked at Mazatlan. They were only
too willing to engage on the Nivelle,
thereby avoiding 1 the payment of blood
advance' money to the boarding-house
keepers. They were duly signed before
the Consul at the regular wages of the
port, $25 a month. In addition to this the
captain gave each man $5 as a bonus, and
the English Government fitted out the
men at its own expense.
THE shipping of the crew of the
British bark Nlvelle came nearly
resulting In a riot at Meiggs
wharf yesterday morning. The

MARCHIONESS OF DUFFERIN.
Lady Dufferin, who was" Miss â¢Flora Da
vis of New York, has scarcely emerged
from the Dufferin family mourning . yet.
Her social career Is all before her. With
a prestige indeed rare, the career. is likely
to be a brilliant one. There Is no prettier
American woman. in England than the
new Marquis of Dufferin's wifeâ and tho
Marquis feels that way about it, too. Lord
Dufferin, unlike his distinguished father,
the late Lord Dufferin, is not . exactly
clever/ but he is charming. He met his
wife when he was an attache to the Brit
ish Embassy in Paris, and until the re
cent death of Lord Dufferin the pair were
known as Lord and Lady Clandeboyeâ
that being one of the minor titles of the
great diplomat which he was at liberty to
place at his son's disposal. The Marquis
is small, slight and clean-shaven. He has
a hobby in his bicycle, and particularly
enjoys riding about the most crowded
streets of London. But books and things
of that kind are not in his lordship's line.
It is said that the late Queen, out of def
erence to Lord Dufferin, helped his boys
into the army, else their bad examination
marks would have kept them forever out.
Lord and Lady Dufferin while in town
Miss Gladys Deacon May Be
Proudest Peeress of All.
A most suoerlor person â
and in consequence there Is practically
no doubt whatever that he will be re
warded for his work in India by a rise
In the peerage, becoming a Viscount at
the very least. Besides this, when Lord
Curzon's father dies the much older title
of Baron Scarsdale will descend to Lady
Curzon's husband.
When Lady Curzon comes back to live
in England she will find something pleas
antly familiar" about her husband's .an
cestral home, for Kedleston Hall, Lord
Scarsdale's country' seat, is built in Gre
cian style with many Corinthian columns.
So also is Government House. Calcutta,
Lord Curzon had the privilege of select
ing designs, for that building and with
sangfroid characteristic of him. chose his
own old home in England for the pattern.
One thing omitted from Government
House is the church which is built into
the side of Kedleston Hall. Lord Cur
zon's father. Baron Scarsdale, the Rev.
Nathaniel Holden Curzon, is clergyman
of the flock at Kedleston and has his own
house for the vicarage, his own chapel
guest of the Duke and his sister, Lady
Mary Howard, at Arundel Castle in Sus
sex, one of the greatest country seats In
England. The Duke is a Roman Catholic.
His only child by his former marriage
died recently.
HONORS AWAIT LADY COTtZON.
Ono Is accustomed to think that the
erstwhile Mary Victoria Lelter of Chicago
has already gathered about the biggest
title that Is open to an American woman
in England. As wife of the sub-King of
India she is a sort of courtesy Queen of
a far greater population than that of the
United States and holds a temporary rank
of which even the gentle little Duchess
of Marlborough is envious in a friendly
way. But the glories of India are fleeting,
and when Lord Curzon returns home from
his extended tenn as Viceroy his wife
would ordinarily have to step back down
to the lowest rank of peeresses, for her
brilliant husband is at present only a
common or garden Baron. As the poet
sings, however,
I am Geonro Nathaniel Curzon,
Somewhat similar to this situation in
the Leigh family Is one wnich may pre
vail In Sir William Vernon Harcourfs If
that vigorous old gentleman, on retire
ment from politics, does what he has often
been Invited to do, and enters the peerage.
Lady Harcourt Is an American. She was
Mrs. Ives when Sir William married her,
and her father was John Lothrop Motley,
the historian. Lady Harcourt would be
followed as peeress in the family by an
other American, her daughter-in-law,
Mrs. Lewis Vernon Harcourt, formerly
Miss Mary Ethel Burns or New York,
daughter of the late Walter Burns, one
of Plerpont Morgan's partners.
And of course among the other notable
"possibilities" of rises in the world are
Mrs. Joseph Chamberlain and Miss Gladys
Deacon. People who claim to know say
that, while Chamberlain will not ever
take a title for himself, he desires one
for his wife, and that if she survives him
she will be given the rank of peeress
in her own right. "" As for Miss Gladys
Deacon, should she and the great Duke of
Norfolk, premier peer In England, ac
tually make a match of itâ as rumor In
sistently says they willâ Mlsb Deacon will
step up ahead even of the Duchess of
Devonshire and the Duchess of Marlbor
ough, the Duke of Norfolk having the
highest hereditary rank of any man in

who i3 doing admirable work this season*
will be the Miml. If only some one would
teach this clever singer what to do with
her hands!
It should not be forgotten among Its
notabilities that the performance, while
a cornucopia of fun, stopped always this
side of horseplay.
Tromben's Rosina, though a little fidg
ety, was much the best thing she has
done. She was piquant and charming to
look at, to begin with, vivacious in the
acting, and one saw reason frequently for
her title, "The Venetian Nightingale."
But the little soprano must cease from
the high note abomination. It 13 tearing
that delicate little throat of hers to pieces,
and rapidly spoiling a charming voice.
Even if the hoi polloi cannot be depended

will, and the voice be saved. It's
worth while thinking about. Miss Trom
ben. Tedeschi. who showed at first a sav

be indulging in the habit. To him, also,
one would say "don't." Tedeschi and the
clever Cortesi as Almaviva and Dr. Bar

Gregoretti's Figaro, a superb present
ment of the part, was the event of last
week's opera, Tha Tlvoll'a new barytone
Is eminently the Tivoli'a most successful
investment of the season's new people.
He gave us first an Amonasro second only
to Salassa's wonderfully poetic conception
of the part, then a Count dl Luna and a
Monsieur Duval unequaled here, and now
the best Flraro that we have had. This
week we shall have Grcgorettl in new
vein, in the role of Iago, in which he
will have to challenge comparison with
the historic Iago of Salassa. Comedy
seems to be the barytone's stronghold,
his Figaro the most affluently funny per
formance I have seen of the rdle, but we
-shall see what we shall see.
In its humorous side the tremendous
difficulty of the Figaro role Is frequently
forgotten. The "Largo al Factotum" ia
among the most tongue-tripping songs in
all the range of opera, Gregoretti'a per
formance of it was simply priceless, his
articulation a marveL Not only so,* but
every word of it brimmed with meaning.
You didn't need any score to know what
he was talking about, and it was so
throughout the whole performance. Tho
recitativos in which the opera abounds
were also models of that not easy art.
One remembers gratefully too Trava
glini, whose Don Basilio was another
pleasing effort In a gallery of good things.
Though Travaglini's voice has neither the
opulent fiber nor smoothness of Dado's,
the basso is an artistic and thoughtful
singer. His "La Calumnla" was most
ably sung.

All kinds of plans are in the air for next

And now. for the farewell Tuesday con

novelty pt the afternoon will be H. J.
Stewart's Incidental music to Montexuma
that will then be given for the first time
outside of the sacred precincts of thÂ« Bo
hemian Grove. I hear very good things
of it. This, and the fact of It being the
last concert, with gratitude to the conduc

crowded house- of the season, where all
have been good.
grand opera season, the last named in

an hour and a half even over the two
hour rehearsal of the symphony, for pur*
love of the work and their conductor. It
has meant going without a meal some
times, and working like a horse at all
times, and one should not forget to be
grateful for these things.
The man and the time are both here,
for that Is what this all means. What
it means to the next half of the season
is even more important. Confidence in the
Scheel leadership has led to the full sup

Ho began, deftly shoveling on another
eyebrow the while: "Well, I took up this
business rather as a Joke, would you be
lieve it?"
"The deadly serious business of being
funny asÂ«. Joke!" I protested. "Fie, fie,
Mr. Dpndy!"
"I did, indeed," scotching a fun furrow
round his mouth. "I've only been in the
business five years â since I was 26 "
"Oh, Dandy!" I murmured. I had given
him 40.
"Used to be a commercial traveler
for "
"For? " as he hesitated.
"A delicate matter," he delicately put
itâ "ladies' "
"Ah "
"And waists. I am a dandy on shirt
waists. I studied medicine for nineteen
months before that. But it was because
I told such good stories on the roadâ best
story-teller on the road they called me â
that I came into this. They used to get
me into all the free shows going to per
form, and I thought I might as well get
paid for it."
. "What did you do first?"
"First verse of the Widow," cried
"Frank."'
"You're too pale to-night, Dandy,"
Donaldson's suggestion.
"This wig's not going to stay on," de
spairingly from the comedian. Then he
desperately plastered its edge to his brow,
and slapped the suggested blush on hia
broad cheek.
"Say, she's off," Frank yelled and flung
the comedian into his top hat, coat and
scarlet vestâ the last gilded button of it
finding Its hole as he raced on the stage
in less space than it takes to say "Jack
Robinson." He sang out as parting bless
ing to the poor fellow: "Fix your hat;
there's dirt on It."
"Oh-o-o," I sighed breathlessly.
"Quick work," Frank said, coolly smil
ing. He's uÂ»ed to it. Then he began to
lay out the 25 cents' worth of starch and
shirt that Dandy spoils nightly in the
fountain he wallows in. He put out, too,
the large, white vest, another wig, a pair
of rubber boots and the dress suit that
accompany the occasion. "Thirty-five
cents it costs in laundry every night for
that five minutes," he put it.
"It's worth more," I said, with a remin
iscent" grin.
Then, off with Mr. Dandy, I turned to
Mr. Donaldson, whose reputed connection
with Ibsen had naturally fascinated me.
A fellow of enviable inches this, a big,
breezy, wholesome personality, poles
apart from the Oswald person in
"Ghosts" that Mr. Donaldson tells me is
one of his favorite parts.
"Yes, I know Ibsen very well." the ac
tor replied. "He and my father were
great friends at homeâ I'm a Swede, you
knowâ and that is how I came to know
him. Yes, I think him the greatest liv
ing playwright, our Scandinavian Shake
speare. I've played most of the maip
parts in his playsâ yet here I am in musi
cal comedy," he ended with an uncom
fortable little laugh. "But that's because
it is the rage"â Mr. Donaldson fascinat
ingly says "wage." "I want to play Ib
sen and Shakespeare. Why they don't
play more of Ibsen's dramas is to me sur
prising. But he will be popular when
America gets more serious and thinks net
so much of the almighty dollar. Now,
people must work too hard for the dollar.
They do not want to think at night. They
must be amused. Do you not think so?"
I nodded assent and then told Mr. Don
aldson of our own Ibsen productions, of
Blanche Bates and Nance O'Neil's Hedda
Gabler, and of the latter's Lady Inger of
Ostrat, ending" up by asking whether
' "Gaibler," as the O'Neil has it, or the
"Gabbler" of the rest of us is correct. "
"Gahbler, of course," the Ibsenite cried,
and Nance O'Neil would never do it again
if she had heard his shocked tone.
"Tell me more of Ibsen, though."
"He's a pretty hard proposition," the
Swede Americanly put it. "Looks very
stern, so!"â but Mr. Donaldson had not
the Honlike mane for his pictureâ "saya
bitter, stinging things, many. But he
doesn't mean them. Winks his eye, you
know. I imitated him on the stage once
In Stockholm in a little two-act comedy.
Lord, how the people laughed!"
"What did he sav?"
"Laughed, too, if he heard of It," the
actor said confidently. "Ibsen used to
be a newspaper man at first," he went
on "editor of a daily paper." ,,; :,
''Lovely!" said this newspaper person.
"There's hope yet."
"Then"â but here Mr. Dandy returned.
His nobla brow was beaded with hon
est toll, but he took up the interview
where he left off. "Now, then, where
was I?"
"You had Just been born," Mr. Don
aldson prompted.
"Ah, in Rochester, New York, thirty
one years ago," Dandy Innocently con
tinued.
"Vos you effer in Zinzlnnatl?" I asked
obviously.
"Yes, and a good enough town It is,"
the New Yorker said, "but Frisco's good
enough for me. There's plenty of things
to keep an actor out of his bed here,
even after New. York."
"Praise from Caesar," I murmured, "but
you were telling me about your start in
this business."
"Well, I began in vaudeville," Mr. Dan
dy replied, tossing off a glass of water
with peculiar relish for a brewer, "and
it was no. trouble at all for me to attain
almost the top notch in eight weeks."
"Really!"
"Yes. I did a Hebrew monologue â very
refinedâ and I got my $150 a week on the
Keith circuit in no time. Then I got
an engagement, $150 a week and {ares
both ways, on the Orpheum circuit here.
Why I : didn't get to Frisco was because
they objected then tb\the Hebrew mono
logue in the OrpheunJ, and somehow I
didn't want to come here after that. But
they've had Julian Rose since, who emu
lates my performance very thoroughlyâ
and is lower pricedâ and I hear- he mada
quite a success with the people. If he
did, I should have eaten them up!"â a
real/sizable "I" please, Mr. Printer.
"That I'm sure of, Mr. Dandy," I en
couraged.-
"I always wrote my own monologues
and parodies, you knowâ it was mostly a
musical act mine. I wrote most of the
verses of 'It Was the Dutch,' that I hear
made no success here at all until I
sung it." .
"A fine comic sonjr, and excellently
Modestly resigned then to being the hub
of things generally and of "The Prince
of Pilsen" in particular, the comedian
gave me a chat to that effect. He had
struck me as being a good deal of a hub
in "The Prince of Pilsen," but I never,
never suspected the depth of his hubbi
ness until hÂ© told me all about it him
self.
Comfortably wigged now, the comedian
turned his attention to his eyebrows and
to me, offering first a cigarto the artist.
"I"â a nice' large one, Mr. Printer,
please, even if i myself have to go with
out an "I" to me name, fo'r Mr. Dandy
speaks â "I don't know if I can give you
what you want. It â this â well â is â prac
ticallyâmy first interview."
I expressed the expected surprise with
out difficulty, for Dandy is an unctuously
humored comedian â¢ on stage, and
prompted: "It is just a little chat about
you and your work that I want, Mr.
Dandy."
Miss Fraganza passed me, a flame of
scarlet, lit by two big brown eyes, Ida
lene Cotton's neat ankles and flaming
halo added zest to the scene and the cur
tain of the first act went down on a bil
lowy mass of girl and uniformed man.
;\Ve bade good-by to Mr. Dandy then.
As he said it, wondering If he had been
"I-Ing" himself too much, he recalled:
"I have some photographs of myself that
might be useful. I will let you have them
if you will be very careful of them. They
were taken at 6 months, at 3 years, 4
years and 6 years old. Mother gave them
to me when I came away, thinking they
might come in."
I thought it a pity, too, and said so.
"In other people's opinion, too," Mr.
Dandy said, "in places where we have
followed the first company."
"That's nice," I said, and followed Mr.
Dandy among the butterfly girls floating
about, to his next scene on the stage. I
had a little chat there with Nick Long,
neat, slim, chipper, who was bewailing
the fact that his and Idalene Cotton'3
specialty, "one of the most difficult turns
of the kind in the business," didn't come
on until 11 o'clock.
"You were with the original company?"
I asked the interpreter of the role of the
real Prince of Pilsen.
He nodded an affirmative and volun
teered, "And in my opinion this company
is the better one."
"There is a double understudy for every
part in the company," he informed me.
"There's one of 'em on to-night, the un
derstudy of the English lord. Clifford,
who has the part, broke two ribs falling
down over a piece of peach peel to-day.
The other chap is doing very nicely, but
we're all a bit nervous for him. Of course
it lacks the zip! zip!" and Dandy snapped
his fingers eloquently.
The artist then humbly asking the com
edian to hold still for a second or two

"You don't seem to make much trou

"No, I'm pretty easy-going. And I sel

my cue!''
, He returned later to tell me that I
should have soon to vacate the dressing
room for his change of costume.
"People think," with a comical attempt
to be pathetic, "that ihe theatrical life
is all pie. But I tell you that witn
changing costumesâ I strip to the skin
after the fountain scene â oft a matinee
day, for example, and with everything
else it's a hard eight-hour day we put in.
Donaldson here's had it for a year and
a half now."
"Well, there isn't any immediate cessa
tion of this in prospect," Mr. Dandy
proudly confessed. "I'm signed for three
years with Mr. Savage and am most llke
iy going to Europe with the company In
thi3 comedy. And, of course, since I've
made good in this I've had stacks of of
fers."
"You have an understudy, you told
me?"
"And you're enjoying it?"
"Every minute of it," said the come
dian, heartily. "I've renamed the tour,
with the approval of the entire company,
â¢Henry W. Savage's pleasure 'tour with
salary.' " :
"And after thlÂ«?"
"Every time I take my hat off"â Mr.
Dandy has returnedâ "I have to hold the
wig on. It's awful. It takes away all
theâ"
"Spontaneity â "
"Ease," the comedian preferred, "from
one's playing."
"Does !t make you nervous?"
"Oh, no; I'm of very unnervous cali
ber," he sized himself up. "But I was
telling you how I came to tte here. Mr.
Ransome played this part of mine in the
original 'Prince of Pilsen,' you know.
Then came the time to send out a second
company. Well, Mr. Savage, our man
ager, is a man who doesn't send out bad
copies of the original company, but tries
to Improve on the first, you see. They
got mo?t of the people together, easily
enough, but then came the problem of
filling Ransome's place. Mr. Savage tried
innumerable men. rehearsed dozens and
dozens of 'em before he got to me. Tou
see, there's a peculiar personality re
quired for the part. I fitted it, however,
and here I am."
"Because it is 'nasty,' as the English
say?" the actor asked. "Believe me. Miss
Partington, if I had a young son and
daughter, I would not hesitate to send
them to a-oy Ibsen play. Think of the
lesson of 'Ghosts' to any young man.
Nothing could be more valuable. Then
for political morality there is 'The Pillars
of Society.' All of the plays have some
lesson."
"He is a master of stagecraft, isn't
he?" Donaldson said. "I played most of
them, really. Oswald, in 'Ghosts,' is my
favorite.*'
"We have not had that here."
"What parts did you play under Ibsen's
own direction?" I asked. "What an in
spiration!"
6ung,"yl subscribed heartily.
He rushed out here again and I
"tackled" my Ibsen man, now resplendent
in full regimentals.
WITH THE PLAYERS AND THE MUSIC FOLK
THE SAN FB AN CISCO CALL, PUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1903.
IT was from Mr. Sothern's room, aye,
from Henry Miller's former quarters,
wherefrom, too, the thoughtful face
of Dave Warfield had looked out at
me, that Jess Dandy's voice, sur
mounting the thrilling shirt and gray
trews of 'The Prince of Pilsen's" first
act, t aid, "Come In."
There was no need of introductions.
Dandy off the -stage Is Dandy on. Ex
cept as to the hair. That he held In his
hand. He used the other plump paw to
drag in a chair for me from Miss Fra
canza's room across the alley, for, needs
not be said, this was behind scenes at
the Columbia,
The comedian was making up for the
performance, and troubled about his wigs.
, He had come in late, to find the rubber
band that holds his star wig. on broken. (
With a Quick "You'll excuse me if I
go on? I'm late, and of course things
have gone wrong," Mr. Dandy gave mo
his round phiz in the make-up mirror
and a back view of an opulent plumpness.
"Don't let me bother you," I said, not
sorry for the chance to look about' me.
I noted first that Hans Wasrner'a up
holstery is all Dandy's own, except as
before said, the hair. His own is shy
and darkish. At his elbow Arthur Don
aldson, once of the Tivoli and as a youth
a protege of Ibsen, was donning the war
paint of the Prince of Pilsen. The stage
manager's dog, small, shaggy, blase,
camped under the washstand. Outside,
running up p.nd down the alley, was a
'brilliant flutter of girls, chiffoned and
spangled in all the colors of the rain
bow, and humming, piping and whistling
"The Prince of Pilsen" as if they did
not get it eight times a week and Sun
days. Perhaps this is because they are
all young, wonderfully young, slim -bits
of girls mostly that haven't turned up
their hair yet. An occasional chorus man
â he is rapidly becoming a curiosityâdec
orated the procession, and 'over all was
the warm, electric, unmistakable odor of
the theater.
Mr. Dandy was now trying on rapidly
and critically two other shocks of stub
born, sandy locks, and apostrophizing the
effect in the mirror. "Won't do. What
do you think of that? Awful, isn't it?"
. He returned then to the first; that cat
but loosely upon his moist brow/ and ex
plained: "We had an understudy rehears-
al this morning and my understudy broke
the thins." t . '
"Larger head than yours, Mr. Dandy,"
I suggested. I hadn't seen all around his
I-ness' of Zinzlnnati's then! "Couldn't. it
be tacked on?"
"Or I could fasten it with a string to
my collar button," he laughed good hu
moredly. Then he turned to his ."helper"
â who had half . a make-up on himself â
and cried: "Quick, Frank, ask Mrs. â â¢
to come here and take a reef In my back
hair." Â¦Â¦ v
Â¦_,-': In a moment the black robed, white
aproned wardrobe mistress flew in, and
with a tremblingly threaded needle took
a tuck in the neck of the- wig." while Mr.
Dandy sighed importantly :;_',' Ah, the pub
lic little thinks on what trivial things. a
â¢ great production hangs." 1

of toadstool growth.
Wasn't that a funny coup at Los Ange

Well, from the grilling, roasting, baking,

the mental working of the relic

visits Bhrines. monuments or
other hallowed spots, and who,
though conscious of the sentiments they
Ftar.d fcr, whips out his knife and chisels

breaks off a finger of a statue, or cuts
his r.tme into a beautiful tree? He Is
the text man on our listâ and, by the
way. since Justice Is an Important elt
mer.t in a fair arraignment, let It be
eaid that the crimes of desecration and
vandalism are not of masculine gender,
for. alas! and alack! women are even
guiltier than men. This crime, as well
cs most Eocial breaches, Is entirely sex
less, personality being the only point of
differentiation. But somehow the world
expects more of menâ men of the better
elaes; they have been in touch with the
world for centuries and have therefore
broadened and gleaned definite views on
more or less indefinite subjects. Thus the
znutllaticn of a tree, that or.ee etabbed

pardonable crime. So, too. Is It In a
woman, but her "previous condition of
servitude" has rendered her somewhat
less responsible. Just as It would In a

But what would you say of a famous
jurist cf California whose name Is scrib

of the gorgeous golden vestments and

That the piece cf exquisite tapestry was
not lost from the eanctuary whore It has
lain for a century was because of the
visilar.ee cf the caretaker, who snatched
Jt away from her without much diplo
matic persuasion. And the most singular
part cf thÂ« episode is that the woman
teemed quitÂ© unconscious of the enormity
of her crime and survived the detection
with perfect equanimity.
Likewise at Monterey, on the brow of
the hill, smiling down upon bay and ocean,
Is the exquisite statue erected by Mrs.
Stanford to the memory of the Father of
Californiaâ Junipero Serraâ and would you

Fj the Hobarts are located In London
