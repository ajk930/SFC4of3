nifer in buff and blue should never look

as he spoke,, and the Bight went /some

me since first I had set" returning foot in

He looked vastly disappointed. 4/ But
you will. Jack? Surely, you have not to
think twice In such a cause?"
"As between King and Congress, .you
mean? *Tls no quarrel of mine."
"Now God save us, John Ireton!" he
burst out in a fine fervor of youthful en
thusiasm that made him all the hand
somer. "I had never thought to hear
your father's son say the like!"
Jennifer shrugged in his turn.
I shrugged.
"And why not, pray? The King's min
ion, Tryon, hanged my father and gave
his estate to his minion's minion, Gil
bert Stair. So, in spite of your declara
tions and your confiscations and your
laws against alien landholders, I come
back to find myself still the son of the
outlawed Roger Ireton, and this same
Gilbert Stair firmly lodged In my father's
Â¦Beat."
"Gilbert Stairâ for sweet Madge's sake
I'm loath to say itâ Gilbert Stair blows
hot or cold as the wind sets
fair or stormy. And I will say this for
him: no other Tryon legatee of them all
has steered so fine a course through these
last five upsetting years. How he trims
so skillfully no man knows. A short
month eince he had General Rutherford
and Colonel Sumter as guests at Appleby
Hundred; now It is Sir Francis Falcon
net and the British Usrnt horse officers
who are honored. But let him -rest; the
cause of independence Is bigger than any
man, or any man's private quarrel, friend
John, and I had hoped-: â "
I laid a hand on his knee. "Spare your
self, Dick. My business in Queensborough
was to learn how best 1 might reach Mr.
Rutherford's rendezvous." .
For a moment he sat, pipe In air, star-
Ing at me as if to make. sure -that he
had heard aright. Then: he , dipt my
hand and wrung it, babbling out some
boyish brava that I made haste 'Â¦Â¦ to '. put

Also, she sits; a horse as if "Tared: to the

"A spy, eb? 'Tls cut cut of .whole cloth,
Dick, my lad. I've never took the oath

"Have you bea*d the newest? But I
know you haven't, since the poet riders
canre only this morning. The war has
shifted from the north in good earnest at
last and we are like to have a taste of
the harrying* the Jerseymen have had
el nee '76. My Lord Cornwallis is come as
far as Camfien. they say; and Colonel
Tarieton has crossed the_ Catawba."
"Sof Then Mr. Rutherford is like to
have bis work cut out for him, I take it."
Jennifed eyed me curiously. "Grif
Rutherford is a stout Indian fighter; no
West Carolinian will gainsay that. But
he is never the man to match Cornwall!*.
Well have help from the north."
"De Kalb?" I suggested.
Again the curious eyeshot. "Nay, John
Ireton, you need not fear me, though I
em juet now this redcoat captain's next
friend. You know more about the Baron
de Kalb's doings than anybody else In
Mecklenburg."
â¢â¢I? What should I know?"
â¢â¢You know a <3eaJ-cr else the* gossips
Xie^nost recklessly."
Â£?Â£iiey do lie if they connect me with
the Baron de Kalb, or with any other of
the patriot side. What are they eaying?"
"That you came straight from the Bar
on's camp In Virginiaâ to bee what you
can sec." - â¢
"If you can." he qualified. "But enough
of these 'by your leave, sirs.' I am near
famished, and as dry as King David's
bottle in the emoke. Will you give me
bite and sud before I mount and ride
egain? "Tis a long gallop back to town
on an empty stomach, and with a gullet
as dry as Mr. Gilbert Stair's wit."
It was over the pipes that Jennifer un
burdened himself of the gossip of the day
in Quecnsborough.
"Tour answer, Captain Ireton!" quoth
ray youngster, curtly. "I am not em
powered to give or take In the matter of
accommodations."
"Not so fast, if you please," I rejoined.
"I have no wish to disappoint your prin
cipal, or his master, the devil. Let It be to
morrow morning at sunrise in the oak
grove which was once my father's wood
field, each man with his own blade. And
I give you fair warning. Master Jennifer;
I shall kill yon bullyragging captain of
.Went horse as I would a vermin of any
'fclier breed."
' At this Jennifer flung himself from his
eaddle with a great laugh.
"I might say that I have no unsettled
quarrel with Captain Falconnet," I de
murred, when I had read the challenge.
"He spoke slightingly of a lady, and I did
but "
Having no second to refer him to, I
broke the seal of the cartel myself. Since
ny enemy had seen fit to come thus far
on the way to his end in some gentleman
ly manner, it was not for me to find diffi
culties among the formalities. In good
truth, Z was overjoyed to be thus assured
that he would fight me fair; that he
would not compel me to kill him as one
kills a wild beast at bay. For certainly
I should have killed him in any event;
6O much I had promised poor Dick
Coverflale on that dismal November
rncrnirg when he had choked out his life
In my arms, the victim first of this man's
treachery, and, at last, of his sword. So.
as I say, I was nothing loath, and yet
Z would not seem too eager.
It was but an euphuism of the time, this
formal preamble, declaring that his er
rand had to do with the preliminaries of
a private quarrel between gentlemen.
Yet I cou'.d pcare restrain a "-nile. For
these upcropplngs of courtier etiquette
have ever se*med to march but minclngly
â¢with the free stride of our western back
woods. None the less, you are to suppose
that I made ehift to match his bow In
some fashion and to say: "At your ser
vice, sir."
Whereupon he bowed again, clapped hat
to head and tendered me a sealed packet.
"From Sir Francis Falconnet, Knight
Bachelor of Beauinaris, volunteer captain
In his Majesty's German Legion." he an
nounced, with stern dignity.
John Ireton, some time of his Majesty's
Royal Scots Blues and late of her Apos
toUc Majesty's Twenty-ninth Regiment of
Hussars?"
"Twas a dayfall to b* marked with a
white stone, even in our Carolina calen
dar. The sun, reaching down to tha
taountaln-glrt horizon In the west, filled
all the upper air with the glory of Its
departing, and the higher leaf plumes
of the great maples before my cabin door
wrought lustrous patterns in glided green
upon a zenith background of turquoise
shot with crimson, like the flgurlngs of
sonae rich old tapestries I had once seen
in my fleid marshal's castle In the Mark
cf Moravia.
Beyond the maples a brook tinkled and
plashed over tho 6tones on Its way to
the nearby Catawba; and Its peaceful
brawling, and the evensong of a pair of
clear-throated -wai biers poised on the
tcpraost twigs of one of the trees, should
have been sweet music In the 'ears of a
returned exile. But on that matchless
bride's month evening cf dainty sunset
arabesques and brook and bird songs, I
was in little humor for rejoicing.
The road made for the river lower down
and followed its windings up the valley;
but Jennifer came by the Indian trace
through the forest. I can tee him now
as he rode beneath the maples, bending
to the saddlehorn where the branches
hung lowest; a pretty figure of a hand
some young provincial, clad in fashions
three years behind those I had seen In
London tho winter last past. He rode
gentlemanwise, in Email-clothes of rough
5ray woolen and with stout leggings over
his hose; but he wore his cocked hat atilt
like a trooper's, ar.d the sword on his
thlph was a gt>od service blade, and no
mere hilt and scabbard for show, such as
our courtier macaronis were just then be
ginning to affect.

irirn how to bend the Indian bow and
loose tho reed-shaft arrow in those hap
pier days before the tyrant Governor Try

For a week and a day I lingered on aC

save, that all the world seemed suddenly
to have grown stale and profitless, and
my life a thins of small . account. One
day I would be minded to go back to my
old field marshal and the keeping. of tha
Turkish-border; the next I would ride
over some part of my. stolen heritage and
swear a great oath to bide till I should
come . to , my own Â¦ again. *Â¦ And on thesa
alternating days the storm of black raga
filled my horizons and I became a derelict
to' drive on any. rock or shoal in this un
charted sea of wrath.
-On one of these gallops farthest afield
I chanced upon the bridlepath that led
to . our old Â¦ hunting; lodge ' In tha forest
depths. Tracing the path to its end
among the maples I found the cabtn, so
lightly touched by time; that-: the, mere
sight of - it carried â¢ me ; swiftly â¢ back to
those happy, days when my father and I
had stalked the white- tailed deÂ«r in tha
hill, 'glades beyond, . ; with ,tbis log-built
cabin for a rest camp. I spurred up un
der tha .low-hanging trees. The door
stood wide . and , a . thin wreath of ..'. blue
smoke curled upward from the mouth at
the wattled chimney. <!^SH$Hflp8BM9l

It was well for him that I knew not at

tor. For I was mad enough to have throt

smirking at me with his evil smile. Bnt

His name was Owen Pengarvln. I would
have you remember it.
I shall not . soon forget the interview
with ' tho lawyer, hi which I was told
the .inhospitable truth. Nor shall I forget
his truculent . leer when he hinted that I
had best be gone out of these parts, stnea
it was not yet too late to bring tha sen
tence of outlawry from tha father to tha
son. SBKSflttBI
-To yon of a younger generation, born
In the day of swift mall coaches and well
kept postroads, the slowness with which
our laggard news traveled In that elder
time must needs seem past belief. It was
early In the year '73 before I began tj>
hear more than vague camp fire tales of
the struggle going on between the col
onies and the mother country; and from
that to setting foot once more upon tha
soil of my native Carolina was still an
other year.
What I found upon landing at New
Berne and saw while riding a jog-trot
thence to the Catawba was a province
rent and torn by partisan warfare.
Though I came not once upon the parti
sans themselves In all that long faring,
there were trampled fields and pillaged
houses enough to serve as milestones;
and in my. native Mecklenburg a 'mine
full charged, with slow-match well
alight for Its firing.
Charleston had fallen, and Colonel
Tarleton's outposts wera already wide
spread on tha . upper waters of tha
Broad and the Catawba. Thus It was
that the first sight which greeted
my eyes when I rode Into Queens
borough was tha familiar trappings
of my old service, and I was made to
know that in spite of Mr. Jefferson's bold
ly written Declaration of Independence,
and that earlier casting of tha King's
yoke by the patriotic Mecklenburgers
themselves, my boyhood home was for
the moment by sword right a part of his
Majesty's province of North Carolina.
You are not to suppose that these things
moved me greatly. As yet I was chiefly
concerned with my own affair and anx
ious to learn at first hands tha cost, to
me of my father's connection with tha
Regulators.
Touching this. I was .not long kept In
Ignorance. Of all the vast demesne o2
Appleby Hundred there was no roof to
shelter the son of the outlawed Roger
Ireton save that of this poor hunting
lodge In the mighty forest of the Catawba.

knew all the metes and bounds of It.
As you have guessed, I was Coverdals's
next friend and second in this affair, and
but for the upsetting news of tha
Tyron tyranny In Carolinaâ news which
reached me on the very day of the meet
ingâI should there and then have called
the slayer to his account.
How my father, who, Presbyterian and
Zreton though he was. had always been
of the King's side, cam* to espouse tha
causa of the "Regulators," as they called
themselves, I know not. In my youthful
memories of him he figures as tha feudal
lord of his own domain more absolute*
than many of the petty klnglings I cama
afterward to know In the German
marches. But this, too, I remember, that
while his rule at Appleby Hundred was
stern and despotic enough, he was ever
ready to lend a willing ear to any tale
of oppression. And If what men say or.
the tyrant Tryon's tax gatherers and
law . Court robbers be more than half
truth, .there was need for any honest
gentleman to oppose them.
What that opposition came to in "71 Is
now ' a tale twice told. Taken in ' arms
against the Governor's authority, and
with an estate well worth receiving, my
father had little justice and less mercy
accorded him. "With many others he was
outlawed, his estates were declared for
feit, and a few days later he, with Ben
jamin Merrill and four more captivated
at the Alamance, was given some farce
of a trial and hanged.
When the news of this came to ma you
may, well suppose that I had no heart to
continue in the service of the King who
could sanction and reward such villainies
as ' these of the butcher William Try on.
So I threw up my lieutenant's commis
sion in the Blues, took ship for tha Con
tinent, and, after wearing .some half
dozen different uniforms In Germany.. was
lucky ". enough . to ' come at length to ser
viceable blows under my old field mar
shal on the Turkish frontier.
' Sine* X would not tell my poor Dick's
â¢Cory to Richard Jennifer, I may not set
It down in cold words here for you. It
was an age-old tragic comedy of a falsa
friend's treachery and a woman's weak
ness; a duel, and the wrong man slain.
And yon may know this; that Falcon
net's most merciful role In It was the part
he played one chill November morning
when he put Richard Coverdale to tha
wall and ran him through.
that time there were two lives between
him and the baronetcy ; but with a moth
er's bqueathlngs to purchase idleness and
to gild his iniquities, he was a fair ex
ample of thejeunesse doree of that Ens
land; a libertine, a gamester, a rakehell;
brave as a tiger Is brave, and to the full
as pitiless. He was a boon companion
of the officers' mess, and for a timeâ and
purposeâ posed as Coverdale" s friend, and
mine.
It was in; the: autumn, of the year '64,
as I was coming . of age. : that my rather

dust-veiled barrier. In the distance. -
"Mere'tricks, Dick, my lad; I have had
fifteen years in which to learn them. 'And
these ' were "but 'country yokela ; armed

had little, wit 'to 'use: them."'-' ' - ; -,
There was no cost worth counting. A
saddle horn bullet-shattered for me, and
the back of Jennifer's sword hand scored
lightly across by another of the random
missiles summed up our woundlnga.' Dick
whipped out his kerchief to â¢ twist about
the scored hand, while I glanced back to
aee if any Tory cared to follow.
"Lord, Jack! 1 owe you one to keep
and one to pay back," quoth my young
ster, warmly. "I never saw a swordsman
till this day!" flt*M0WHHHll
Our horses took the barrier in a flying
leap, straining themselves for the race
beyond. When we had pulled them down
to a foot pace we were safely out of rifle
shot and there was epace to count the
cost.
"Over with you!" I shouted, pricking
tbe man who would have mowed him
down with a great scythe handled as a
eword. â¢
It was my first fleshing of the good old
Andrea, and a better oalanced blade I
had never swung In hand-to-hand mel
lay. As we closed with the half-dozen de
fenders of the barrier, Jennifer reined
aside to give me room-to play to right
and left and in the midst of it went nigh
to death because be held his hand to
watch a cut and double thrust of mine.
A line of the ragged horsemen strung
Itself awkwardly across the jj road to
guard the nlmsy barricade and at this
we charged. Btirrup to stirrup. In the
dash there was a scattering volley from
the wood, answered instantly by the bel
lowings of Jennifer's great pistols; and
then we came to the steel.
"Then at them, in God's name. Charge!"
It needed but the word and we were in
th'e thick of it. I remembered my old
field marshal's maxim, "Von Feinden
umringt. 1st die Zolt zu zerschmettern" ;
and truly, being so plentifully outnum
bered, we did strike both first and hard.

I put two and tw-o together.
"So Palconnet la on terms at Appleby

' "Oh. surely. Gilbert Stair. keeps open

"E!r Francis had ever a sure hand with

have bitten my masterless tongue.
"6o?" queried Jennifer. "Then this is
not your first knowing of him?"
"No." So much I said and no more.
We rode on In silence for a little space,
and then my youtrjling must needs break
out seain 1n fresh be#eechings.

may not soil my page here for you.

cri<d the younger of the twain; and then
I took two strides to front him fairly.

should not Ira enough, I smote him in tha

You m*y bÂ« sure I conned these few
brave words till I bad them well by heart;
and later, when my voice waa surer and
my eyes less dim, I summoned Darius and
bade him tell me all he knew. And It
was thus learned what I have here set
down cf my father's end.
The next day. all Indecision gone. I rode
to Queensborough to ascertain. If so I
might, how best to throw the weight of
the good old Andrea Into the P**â¢ 1
scale, meaning to push on thence to Char

Twas none so easy to learn wnat I
needed to know; though, now I sought

developed. One was that thia Ught-horae
outpost in our hamlet waa far in afl-
TSJiee of thÂ» army of lnvaslon-eo far
that It was dangerously Isolated anfl be

secrecy maintained and the holding of
the troop in Instant readiness for fight
or flight
Why this little handful of British reg

Lord Comwallia' main, which was then
well down upon thÂ« Wateree. I could not
guess. But for the secrecy and vigilance
there were good reasons and sufficient
The r&triot militia had been called out

Â°I had this information In guarded whis

and was but a moment free of
the taproom, when I first saw Margery
Stair and eo drank of the cup of trem
bling with madness in Us lees. She was
ridir.Â£. unmasked, down the high road,
not en a pillion as most women rode in
that day. but upon her own mount vmn
a black' groom two lengths in the rear.
I can picture her for you no better tnan
I cou'.d for Richard Jennifer; but this I
know, that even this first eight of her
moved me stransely. though the witching
beauty of her face and the proudness of
It were more a challenge than a becken-
A blade's length at my right where I
was standing in front of the tavern,
three redcoat officers lounged at ease;
and to one of them my lady tossed a nod
of recognition, half laughing, half de
fiant. I turned quickly to look at the fa
vored one. He stood with his back to me;
a tnsn about ray own bigness, heavy built
and well muscled. He wore a bob-wig,
as <! d many of troop officers, but his uni
form Â»as tailor-fine, and tho hand with
whiih Â».e was resettling his hat was be-
Jewt ledâ overmuch bejeweled. to my
taste.
Thereupon, aa you would gueta, X caaae
immediately into some email portion of
x&y kdns-dom. Though Darius was the
patriarch, the other blacks were also ftt
p'.uves from Appleby Hundred} and for
the son of Roger? Ireton there was in
etant vassalage and ' loyal eerrica. . But
be5t of all, on my firat evening . before
the handful cf fire in the great fireplace,
Darius brought me a package swathed
In many wrappings of Indian tanned
o>rrskin. It contained my father'a aword
and more precious than this, a message
from the dead. My father'a farewell waa
written upon a leaf torn from hla Jour
nal and was but a hasty acrawL I here
transcribe It:
â¢My Son: I know not If this will ever
come into rour bands, but It and my
tword shall be left In trust with the faith

" 'Ware the wood!" he said sharply,
and none too soon, for even aa he spoke
the glade at our left filled as by, maglo
with a motley troop deploying Into the
road to surround us.
"Now who are theee?" I asked; "friends
or foes?"
"Foes who will bang you In your own
halter straps; Jan Howart's Tories â tho
same that burned Westcotts in their cabin
a fortnight since. Will your horse take

From that we fell ailent again, being
but a little way from the rendezvous, and
ao continued until, at a sudden turn In
the road, we came in sight of a rude bar
ricade of felled trees barring the way.
Jennifer aaw It first and pulled up short,
loosing his pistols In their cases as he
drew rein.
Jennifer smiled grimly and ; gave hla
horse the, rein. "I think you'd charge the
fall of man to him If that would give you
better leave to kill him. I'd hate to own
you for my enemy, John Ireton." ':â¢:'.
For all our swift speeding we were yet

I think she must have seen that this

surely, I thought it was the very Irony
of fate that I should thus be brought half

with my enemy and his second to share
the burden of me.
"But your father?" I queried, when the
silence had grown overlong.
"My father is away at Queensborough.
so you must e'en trust yourself to my
tender mercies. Captain Ireton. Are you
strong enough to have your wound

She asked, but waited for no answer of
mine. Summoning a black boy to hold
the basin of water, she fell to upon the
wound dressing with as little ado aa if

"Dear heart! 'tis a monstrous ugly

to go about picking a Quarrel 'with Sir

and then I could have curved my foolish
tongue.

She knew not that X was awake and
slaking, the thirst of my eyes upon the

as few ever * saw her, I think, with the
womanly barriers of defense all down.
'Tis -a' hard . test, . and ,' one that makes a
blank at rest of many a face beautiful
enough in action: but though. this lady's
face was to the full aa changeful aa any
April Â«ky. It was never leu than tri

What with the blood lettlngs and the
my : s mother's , portrait,"... the ", room ; .was ' a
counterpart t of iniy ' bed * chamber rat
Appleby I. Hundred.^ There 1. waa ~ even . ;< a '
faint odor of > lavender - in [ the I bed i linen ,
and the sense of smell, which hath \ ever
a better, memory. 1 , than any l othtr, carried
me J swiftly.; back- . to my boyhood and to
the ; remembrance i that ; my mother had
always kept a spray or two of that sweet
herb in* her! linen . closet. ' ; ' . & x
At the bedside there was a claw footed
table, which | also had the look of an old
friend; and on It a dainty, porringer, filled
with cuttings of fragrant sweetbrlar. This
was some womanly conceit, I said to my
self; and then I laughed, though the laugh
aet a pair of wolf ' a Jaws at work on ' my
shoulder. ' " For you must know . that I
had lived the full half of King David's
span. of three score and ten years, and
more, and 'what womanly softness had
fallen to my . lot had been well Â¦got and
paid for.; . , .
I closed my eyes the better to remem
ber, what had befallen, and when I opened
them again was fain, to wonder if the
moment of. back- reaching stood not for
some longer time. In the deep bay of
the window, was a great chair of Indian
wickerwork, and I could have sworn it
had but now been empty. Yet when I
looked again a woman sat in It.
Now of a truth I had i seen this wo
man's face but twice; and once it wore a
smile of " teasing I mockery and once was
full of terror; but I thought I should live
long and suffer much before the winsome
challenging beauty of it would let me
bÂ«ai I had been before I had looked upon
it : Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢_â¢ Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦.. :;,-.:
She glanced up Quickly. w4th .a smile
which might havÂ» been', mocking; or liv
ing; I could not tell which.lt was.
"Did he make you* his deputy, to tell
me so. Captain Ireton?" . â¢ .."
Now I might have known that she was
only luring me on to some pitfall of
mockery, but I did not, and must needs
burst out In some clumsy disclaimer
meant to shield my dear lad. Arid la the
midst of It she laughed again;; '
"Oh, you do amuse me mightily, men
capltaine." she cried. "I do protest I
shall come to see you of tener. ."Its as
good as any play!"
"Saw you ever a play. In this back
woods wilderness?" I asked, glad of any
excuse to change the talk and kÂ»ep her
by me. 'Â¦ "- - >
"No, Indeed. Bat you are not to think
that no one has seen the great world
save yourself. Captain Ireton. What
would you say if I should tell yon that
I, too, have seen your London, and evea
your Paris?" ..v VV ..â¢ 'â¢ -
How is It. that love transforms the once
contemptible Into a thing most highly to
be prized? My eight year* of campaign
ing on the Continent had given, me the
French speech, or so much of It as the
clumsy tongue of me could master, and
I had always held It In hearty English
scorn. Yet now 1 was eager enough to
speak it with her and to take aa my very
own the little cry. of Joy wherewith she
welcomed my hesitant mouthing of it.
From that we fell to. talking in her
mother's tongue of the hardships of those
same Huguenot emigres; and ' , wh ?fL, I
looked not at her I could speak in term*
dispassionate and cool . of , this or aught
else, and when I looked upon her my
heart beat faster and my blood leaped
quickly and I knew not always what It
After a timeâ 'twas when Darius fetched
me my supper and the candles-*he went
away; and so ended a day which saw
the beginning of a struggle fiercer than
any the turbaned Turk had ever given
me ForwhÂ«n I had eaten, and was
alone with time to think. I knew weU
that I loved this woman and ai
ways love her: this In spite of honor, or
loyalty to Richard Jennifer, or any other
thing in heaven or earth.
"The last I will da right heartily. 'Twas
but the simple truth, but it was 111 spoken
in your presence. Mistress Stair."
At this she laughed merrily; and in al!
my world wanderings I had never heard
a sound so gladsome as this sweet laugh
of hers when she would be on the for
giving hand.
"Surely, any one would know you are
a soldier. Captain Ireton. No other could
make an apology and renew the offense
so li-nocently in the same breath." Then
heÂ»- mood changed again in the dropping
of an eyelid, and she sighed and said:
"Poor Dick!" '-J
As ever when she was with me, my
eyes were devouring her; and at the sigh
and the trembling of the swee^ lips in
sympathy. I found that curious love-mad
ness, coming upon me again.": Then I
law that I must straightway -dig some
;hasrn impassable between ' this Â¦( woman
and me, as I should hope to bajjoyal to
my friend. So I said: "He loves you well.
Mistress Margery." ! Â¦â¢/*'
"Why don't you . apeax, sir?" sh*
snapped, flying out at me In a passion for
my lack of words. Â¦ Â¦. . â¢
"What should I say? I have not for
got that once you called me ungenerous."
"You should defend yourself If you can.
And you should ask my pardon for call-
Ing 'my father's guest hard names."
I could' not tell her that, though my
quarrel with this villain was but thÂ»
avenging of poor Dick- Coverdale'a
wrongs, Richard Jennifer's was for the
Baronet's affront to her. â¢ So I bore the.
blame In silence, glad ; enough to bÂ« as
sured that my dear lad was only wound
ed, r . â¢ Â¦ . .-. --.__
Now, In all my surmlslnrs. I had not
thought of this, and truly if ahs had
sought far and wide for a whip to scourge
me with she could have found no thong
to cut so deep.
"God help me!" I groaned. "Has this
fiend Incarnate killed my- poor lad?"
"No. he Is not dead." she confessed, re
lenting. "But ha has the Baronet's bullet
through his sword arm for the sake of
your over-seas disagreement with Sir
Francis." â¢ >
"Captain Ireton, I will know the true
cause of this Quarrel which, faiUn* In
yourself, you pass on to Richard Jenni
fer I" in* cried. "Was It not enough that
you should ret yourself half slain, with
out sending this headstrong boy to his
death?"
With this surmise I was trying to con
tent myself on that evening of the third
day, when Mistress Margery bunt in
upon me, bright eyed and with her ch^f*?
aflame.
After this I saw her no more for six
fall circllngs of the clock, hands, and
grew fair famished for a sight of her
sweet face. But to atone, she or some
messenger of Richard Jennifers brought
me my faithful Darius, and he It was
who fetched me my food and drink and
dressed my wound. From him I gleaned
that the master of Appleby Hundred had
returned from Queensborough and that
there were officers in red coats continual
ly going back and forth, always with a
hearty welcome from Gilbert Stair.
Now, though the master of my stolen
heritage had little cause to love me, I
thought he had still less- to fear me, so it
seemed passing strange that he came not
once to my bedchamber to pass the time
of day with his unbidden guest or to ask
how he feared. But -in this, as in many
other things, I reckoned, without my en
emy, though I might have known that
Sir Francis would be oftenest among the
red-coated officers coming and going.
But stranger than this, or than my
lady's continued avoidance of me, was
the . lack of a visit . from Richard
Jennifer. Knowing well my dear lad's
loyalty to- tho patriot cause, I could
only conjecture that he had finally broken
Margery's enforced truce to go and
Join Mr. Rutherford's militia, which, as
Darius told me, was rallying to attack a
Tory stronghold at Rarasour's Mill.

new and then, as well, though never
mockingly, as of the others. Nay, once
when 1 pressed her on this point, asking
her plainly If my dear lad had not good
cause to hope, she would only smile and
turn her face away and say that of alP
the- men she knew the hopeful ones pleas
ed her best. So I was ihus assured that
if it were a scale for love to tip, my lady's
heart would fail to Richard.
Now 1 took this to be a hopeful sign.
that she would tell me freely of these
her little heart affairs, and seeing her
Â¦O safe upon the side of friendship held
the looser rein upon my own unchartered
passion. So long as I could keep my love
well masked arid hidden what harm could
come to her or any if I should give it
leave to live in prison? None. I thought,
and yet at times was made a very cow
ard by the thought. For love, like other
living things, will grow by what it feeds
upon, and once fuil grown may haply
c:me to laugh at bonds, however strong
or cunningly devised.
With such a fever in my veins it was
little wonder that my wound healed slow
ly. As time passed by. with never a word
of news from the world withoutâ if Mar
gery kn*w auzht of the fighting she
would never lisp a syllable to me â and
with Gilbert Stair still keeping churlishly
beyond the sight or sound of me, 1 fretted
sorely and would be gone.
One mcrning in the summer. Sd of June,
my lady came early and surprised me
pacing back and forth. Whereat she
scolded me as was her wont when I grew
restive.
-What weighty thing have you to do
that you should be so fierce to be about
it, Mor.s.eur Impetuous?" she cried. "FI
done! you'd try the patience of a saint:"
â¢Which you are not." I ventured. "But
truly. Margery. I am growing stronger
now and the bed does irk me desperately,.
if you must know. Besides" â
"Well, what Is there else besides? Do
I not pamper you enough?"
I laughed. "I'll say whatever you
would have me cay â eo It be not the
truth."
"I'll have you say nothing until you
sit down."
She pushed the treat chair of Indian
wlckerwork Into place before the window
bay. and when I was at rest ebe drew
up a low hassock and sat at my feet.
"Now you may go on," she said.
"You have not told me what you would
have trie sav."
'"The truth." she commanded.
What is truth T' 6aid jesting Pi
late,' " I quoted. "Why do you suppose
my Lord Bacon thought the Roman pro
curator jested at such a time and place?"
"You are quibbling. Monsieur John. I
want to know why you are so impatient
to be gone."
"Saw you ever a man worthy the name
who could be content to bide inactive
when duty calls?"
"That is not the whole truth," she said,
half abstntlv. ' "You think you are un
welcome here."
" 'Twas you said that; not I. But I must
r eeds know your father will be relieved
whtn he Is safely quit of me."
" 'Twas you said that, not I. Monsieur
John," she retorted, giving me back my
own words. "Has ever word been brought
>cu that he would speed your parting?"
"Surely not, sir.ee I am still here. But
you must know that I have never seen his
face as yet."
"And is that strange? You must not
forget that he is Gilbert Stadr, and you
are Roger Ireton's son."
"I am not likely to forget it. But still a
vord of welcome to the unbidden guest
Â¦would not have come amiss. And tt was
none' of my seeking â this asylum In his
hcuÂ«e."
"True: but that has naught to do with
any coolness of my father's."
"What Is it. thenâ besides the fact that
I ara Roger Ireton's son?"
"I think 'twas what you said to Mr.
Pengarvin."
"That little smirking wretch? What has
he to fay or do In this?"
She looked away from me and said: "He
is my father's factor and man of affairs."
"Ah. I have always to be craving your
psrdon. Margery- But I said naught to
this parchment-facedâ to this Mr. Pengar
vin. that might offend your father, or
any."
"How. then, will you explain thisâ that
you swore to drive my father from Ap
pleby Hundred as soon as ever you had
raised a following among the rebels?"
" 'Tls easily explained, this thrice ac
cursedâoh, pardon me again, I pray you;
I will not name him any name at all.
What I meant to say was that he lied. I
made no threats to him; to tell the plain
truth. I was too fiercely mad to bandy
words with him."
"What made you mad. Monsieur John?"
â¢"Twas his threat to meâ to taint me
with my father's outlawry. Do you great
ly blame me. Margery?"
"No."
Thereat a silence came and sat between
us. and I fell to loving her the more be
cause of It; but when she spoke I always
loved her more for speaking.
Was ever man so tempted since the fall
of Adam? As I have writ it down for you
In measured words. I was no more than
half a patriot at this time. And love has
made more traitors than Its opposltes of
lust or greed. In no uncertain sense- 1 was
a man without a country: and this fair
ipaiden on the hassock at my feet was
all the world to me. I E aw In briefer
time than any clock hands ever meas
ured how much a yielding word might do
for me; and then I thought of Richard
Jennifer and was myself again.
"Nay. little one." I said, "there has
been no mistake. For their own purposes
my enemies have passed the word that I
am here as the Baron de Kalb's paid spy.
That Is no mistake: 'tls a lie cut out of
wholÂ«> cloth. I came here straight from
New Berne, and back of that from Lon
don and the Continent, and scarcely know
the buff and blue by sight. But I am
Carolina born, dear lady, and this King
George's Governor hanged my father. So,
when God gives me strength to mount and
ride"
''Now, who Is fierce?" she cried. And
then. like liehtnlng: "Will you raise a
band of rebels and come and take your
own again?"
"You know I will not," I protested, so
gravely that she laughed again, though
now there were tears, from what well
rpring of emotion I knew not. In her
eyes.
"Oh, mercy me! Have you never one
little grain of imagination. Monsieur
John? You are too monstrous literal for
our poor, jesting age." Then she sobered
quickly and a-lded this: "And yet I fear
that this Is what my father fears."
I did not tell her that he might have
f*ar>"d It once with reason, or that now
the houseless dog she petted should have
life of me though mine enemy should sick
him on. But I did say her father had
no present cause to drea.d me.
"H* thinks he has. Aud surely there
is cause enough." she added.
I fmiled, and. loving her the more for
her fairness, must smile again.
"Nay. you have changed all that, dear
lady. Truly. I did at first fly out at him
and all concerned for what had made me
a poor pensioner in my father's house^ â
or rather in the house that was my fath
er's. But that was while the hurt was
new. I have been a soldier of -fortune
too long to think overmuch of the loss of
Appleby Hundred. 'Twas my father's,
certainly., but 'twas never mine.".-
"And yetâ and yet It should be yours.
John Ireton." She said it bravely, with
uplifted face and eloquent eyes that one
who ran might read. .
"'Tl? good and true of you to say so,
little one; but there's two sides to .that.
as well. So Â«iy father's acres ! come at
IaÂ«t'to you and Richard Jennifer. % ehall
be well content, I do assure â¢ you, Mar
gery." . â¢
She sprang up from her low .seat and
went to stand in the window-bay. After
a time she turned and faced me again,
and the warm blood was In cheek and
neck, and there was a sort light In her
eye* to make them shine like stars. "
"Then you would have me marry Rich
ard Jennifer?" she asked. ' .
'Twas but a little word that honor bade
m<Â» fay, and yet it choked me and I could
not sÂ«ay It
"Dick would have you, Margery; and
Pick Is my dear friendâ as I am his."
"But you?" she queried. "Were you
my friend, as well, is this as you ' would
have it?"
My look went past her through the
lead-trimmed window panes to the great
oajts and hickories on the lawn; to these
and to the white road winding in and out
among them. While yet I sought for
words In which to give her unreservedly
to my dear lad. two horsemen trotted into
view. . One of them v,-as a king's man;
the other a civilian in sober, blaok. The
redcoat rode as English troopers do. with
a firm spat, as If the man were master of
hi? mount; but the small man in black
seemed little to the manner born, and
daylight shuttled In and out beneath him.
keeping time to the jog trot of his beast.
I thought it passing strange that with
all good will to answer her, these coming
horsemen seemed to hold me silent. And,
Indeed. I did not rpeak until they came
so near that I could make them out.
"I am your friend. Margery, mine; as
good a friend as you will let me be. And
as between Richard Jennifer and another,
I should be a sorry friend to Dick did I
not"
She heard the clink of horseshoes on
the gravel and turned, signing to me for
silence while she looked below. The win
dow overhung the entrance en that side,
and through the opened air casement I
heard some babblement of voices, though
not the words.
"I must go down," she said. " 'Tis com
pany come, and my father -Is away."
She passed behind my chair and. hear
ing her hand upon the latch, I had
thought her gone â gone down to welcome
my enemy and his riding mate, the fac
tor. Bet while I was cursine ,my un
ready, tongue and repenting that I Â¦ had
not given her some small word of warn
ing, she spoke ajtain.
"You say 'Richard Jennifer or another.'
What know you of any other, Monsieur
John?" .
"Nay. I know nothing save what you
have told me: and from that I have been
hoping there was no other."
"But If I say there may be?"
My heart went sick at. that. True, I
had thought to give her generously to
Dick, whese right was paramount; but
to anotherâ
"Margery, come hither where I may see
you." And when she stood before me like
a bidden child, "Tell me, little comrade,
who is that nther?"
But now her mood was changed again,
and from standing sweet and pensive she'
fell a-laughing.
"What Impudence!" she cried. "Ma fol!
You* should borrow Pere Matthleu's cas
sock" and breviary: then mayhap I might
confess to you. But not before."
But still I pressed her.
"Tell me, Margery."
She tossed her head and would not look
at me. "Dick Jennifer is but a boy: sup
pose this other were a man full grown."
"Yes?". . ...
"And a soldier."
The sickness in my heart became a fire.
"O Margery! Don't tell me It .is this
fiend who came just now!"
All In a flash the jesting mood was
gone.' but that which, took its place was
strange to me. Tears came; her bosom
heaved. And then ehe would have passed
me, but I caught her hands and held them
fast* ; - .
"Margery, one moment: for your own
sweet sake. If not for Dick's or mine,
have naught to do with this devil's emis
sary of, a man. If you only knewâ If L.
dared tell you"â
But for once. It seemed. I had stretched
my privilege beyond the limit. She whip
ped her hands from my hold and faced
me coldly. '.
"Sir Francis says you are a brave gen
tleman. -Captain Ireton, and though he
knows well what you would be about, he
hag not sent a file of men to put you in
arrest. And in return you call him names
behind his back. I shall not stay to lis
ten, sir."
With that she passed again behind my
chair, and once again I heard her hand
upon the latch. But I would say. my say.
".Forgive me," Margery. I pray you;
'twas only what you said that made me
mad. 'Tls less than naught If you'll deny
It."
I waited long and patiently, and thought
she must have gone before her answer
came. And this uÂ» what she eaidr
"If I must tell you, then, 'tis now two
weeks and more since Sir Francis Falcon
net asked me to marry him. Iâ I hope you
do feel better. Captain Ireton." .
And with these bitterest of all words to
her leave-taking, she left me to- endure
as best I might the hell of torment they
had lighted for me.
CHAPTER VL
SHOWING KOW RED WRATH MAY
HEAL A WOUND.
It was full two days after the coming
of the Baronet and the ft !tor-lawyer Pen
garvln before I saw my lady's face near
hand again, and sometimes I was glad
for Richard Jennifer's sake, but oftener
would curse nnd swear because I was
bound hand and foot and could not balk
my enemy.
I knew Sir Francis and the lawyer still
lingered on at Appleby Hundred â Indeed,
I saw them dally from my window â ami
r>artus would be telling me that they
â¢waited upon the coming of some, courier
from the south. But this I disbelieved.
Some such like lie the Baronet might
have told, I thought: but when I saw
him walk abroad with Margery on his.
arm. pa'ing back and forth beneath tho
oaks and bending low to catch her light
est word with grave and courtly defer
ence that none knew better how to feign,
I knew wherefore he stayedâ knew and
raged afresh at my own Impotence, and
for the thought that Margery was wholly
at the mercy of this devil.
Yours Is a colder century than was
ours, my dears. Your art has tempered
love- and passion Into sentiment, "and hate
you have learned to call aversion or dis
like. - But we of that simple-hearted elder
time "".were more downright; and I have
writ'the word, I. mean in. saying that my
'love was at the mercy of this fiend.
I know, not how It is or why, but there
are men who ha.ve.thls giftâ some winning
way to tiirn- &; woman's head 'or touch her
heart; and I' knew .well this gift was his.
'Twas not his face,-' for that was some
thing , less tWahjbandsome, tomy fancy;
nor yet his figure, though that was big
and. soldierly enough. It was rather in
some 'subtlety of manner, some power of
simulation whereby in any womanly heart
he, seemed to stand at will for that which
he was not. "Â¦â¢Â¦'. " â¢
As- 1 have said, I knew him well enough;
knew him incapable of love apart from
passion., and- that to him there. was no
sacredness in. maiden chastity or wifely
vows. So he but gained his end he cared
no whit what followed ;after; ruin, broken
hearts, lostsoufs, a man slain now and
then to keep the scale from tippingâ all
were.' as one to- him, or to the Francis
Falconnet Vknew. ' .
And touching marriage, with Margery
or any other,- I feared that love would
have no- word to 6iy. Passion there
might -be- and that fierce desire to have
and wear. which' burns like any miser's
fever in the blood; but never love as lov
ers measure It. Why, then, had he pro
posed to-: Margery?. The answer did not
tarry. Since he was now but a -gentle
man volunteer It. was plain that he had
squandered his estate and so might brook
the marriage, chain if It were linked up
with my father's acres.
So, brooding over: this, 'I wore out two
moat dismal daysâ the first In many I
had had to pass alone. But on the morn
ing of the third the sky was lightened,
though then the light was but a flash and
darkness followed quickly after. She
came again and brought me a visitor; 'It
was .this same Father Matthieu with
whom | she had . jestingly compared me.
and lest I. should take my punishment
too lightly, stayed but to make the good
priest known to roe. , â¢
Now.I, was. born and bred an heretic,
by any ".papist's reckoning, but" I have
ever held it witless in that man who lets
a creed obstruct a friendship. Moreover,
thia'sweet-faced cleric was the friendliest
of men; ' friendly, and yet the wiliest
Jesuit of them all, since he read me at
a glarrce and fell straightway to praising
Margery./:- -. ' * . . -. - Â¦ -.- .â¢â¢ '- --.
"A' truly sweet young Mlemoiselle," he
said, by- waiy' of foreword, no sooner '.was
the door closed behind her, and while.ho
preached a sermon on this text! -grew,
to know -and love him. I . -. T -.
As I have said, I was like any prisoner
in' a dungeon -for ; lack of news.. and-, sp
by degrees I fetched him round to tellihg
me. of what i was. going on- bevond my
window-sight of: lawn and foiest. ' .' ' r
Brave deeds were to the fore, it seemed.'
At Ramsour's Mill, a few 'mites north arid
west. ' some i little â¢ handful of determined'
patriots had bested thrice their, number of
the King's partiean3, and that- 'with
out a leader bigger V than a â¢ county
colonel. Lord "Rawdon", ; in . -"command,
of- Lord . Cornwallis' .van, had come
as" far -as" Waxhaw Creek, but, being
unsupported, bad "withdrawn to Hanging
Rock. Our Mr. -Rutherford was- on his.
v. ay to I the' forks of Yadkln to engage the
Tories gathering under i Colonel Bryan.
As. yet, it "seemed, { wfl ' had - no force of:
any* consequence to, take the field against
CornwalllB." thpugh there were flying ru
mors of -fen' army-marching .from Virginia,
with a. new" appointed general at its head.
As r you may, well suppose, this : news
awoke In me.the lust of battle, and I must
chafe the more, for-having it. And while
my>iÂ»Itor talked .onand I was listening
with Jthe- outward .ear/ my ; brain was busy.;
putting" two and two. together. How came
it that : the British outpost still remained
at Queens borough,: with my Lord Raw
don withdrawn 'and: the patriot' home
guard-- "well Â¦ftown ;upon-its * rear? Some
urgent reason for the stay there must be;
and at that" X remembered what Darius
had told" me .of -Its captain's waiting for
some. messenger from the south.
I : scored - this matter with "a question
mark, putting It aside to think on more
when". I should" be alone. .And when the
priest had told. me all the news at large,
we came again to; speak of Margery.
"I go and come through all. this border
land," he said, when I had asked him how
and why he. came '.to Appleby Hundred,
"but It was mam'selle's message brought
me here. She is my. one ewe lamb In all
this region and I would "journey far to
see her." Â¦ â¢ â¢ -, ; , â¢
I wondered pointedly at this, for In that
day the west was fiercely Protestant and
â¢the mother church had scanty footing in,
the borderland. - .â¢
This put me' keen ( upon -remembering
what had gone before. I thought it
strange, knowing how perilous the time
and place must be for such as he. But
not until' he, rose and, bidding me good
day, left me to myself, did I so much as
guess the thing his coming meant. When
I had guessed it; when I put this to that
âher telling me Sir ; Francis had proposed
for her, and 'this her* sending for the
priestâ the madness of tey love for her 1
was as naught compared to that -anger Â¦
which seized and racked me.
I know not how the hours of this black
day were made to come and go, grinding
me to dust and ashes In their passage, yet
leaving me' alive and keen to suffer at the
end.
A thousand times that day I lived in
torment through the | scene In which the
priest had doubtless come to play his part
of joiner. The stage for It would be the
great room fronting south; the room- my
father used to call our castle hall. For
guests I thought there would be space
enough and some to spare, for, as you
-'know, our Mecklenburg was patriot to the
core.. But as to this, the bridegroom's
troopers might fill out the tale, and In
my heated fancy I could see them grouped
beneath the candlesconces with belts and
baldrics- fresh pipe-clayed, and shakos
doffed; and r-abretaches well in front. "A
man full-grown â a soldier," she had said;
and trooper-guests were fitting In such
case. -...",Â¦. ' . ' .. Â¦ â¢ ' ; :
Fr6m serving In a Catholic land I knew,
the customs of the "mother church. So I
could see 'the priest In* cassock, alb and
stole as he. would stand before 'some
makeshift altar lit with candles. And as
he stands they come to kneel before him;
my. winsome Margery. In all v her royal
beauty, a" child to love, and yet 'an em
press peerless in her woman's realm; and
at her'side. 'with- his knee touching hers,
this ;man: who was 'a devil! â¢ - - Â¦â¢- "â¢ â¢'
What wonder . If .- 1 ;cursed ' and I choked
and cursed again . when t the â¢ maddening
thought of what. all. this should mean for
my poor wouoded Richardâ and . later on,"
for Margery âpossessed me? In
which of these 'hot 'fever-gusts of rage'
the thought" of interference', came, I know,
not. -But that . 'ifcameA -i at lengthâa
thought and plan,* full-grown at; birthâ I
do know. ' t -'; ; , f ' '- i l' Â¦'Â¦ Â¦
The pointing of the plan , was desperate
and simple. It was neither more nor less
than this: J, .khe'w the .house and every.
turn and "passage In It, and. when the hour
should strike'I said' t should go down and;
skulk -among 'the gue'sts," and at the cru-'
ciaKmomehf find .'or seize i"a weapon-atid
fling? myself this as - he
should kneel before the altar.
With strength to bend him back and
strike one blow, I saw not why it might
not win. And as. for strength," I : have
learned this in war: that so -the rage be
hot enough 'twill" nerve a dying man to
hack and hew and stab as . with the
strength of ten. r ] â¢-".: v*"
Although Jt was most terribly bverlong
in coming, the end of that black day did
.come at last, and with it Darius to fetch
my. supper and the candles. - You may be
sure I questioned him, and "If you know
the blacks'you'II smile and say I had my

WLen he was gone I ate a soldier's por

\ At that I capped the candles., and 'tak^

eet myself to watch 1 for the lighting of
the ; great ;room at the front. Thlshad
two windows on my side, and; while,* I
could not see them I knew,, that. I should
see the sheen of light upon the. lawn. ~%:\
Behind the close drawn curtain; 5 though
. I could see, it. not, the virgin forest dark
ened.all the land: and frbm^afar. within
Its .secret depths; I heard., or.- r, thought
I ; heard, the dismal howling of the'tim
ber, wolves. Below the bouse was silent
as â¢ the grave and this -seemed strange
to me. Fpr In the time of?my youth a
wedding was a joyous thing. -Yet. I- would
remember that these present times 'were
perilous; and also that my bridegroom
captained, but a- little band of troopers in
a land butnow become fiercely debatable.
It must have been an hour or more be
fore the sound of distance muffled h'obf
beats r on the. road broke In upon the
chirping ; silence of the night. \ I looked
and listened," straining my .... eye s and -ear.
hearing but little and seeing less until
three shadowy horsemen Issued from the
curtain wall of black beneath my window.
It was plain that, others -watched '-as
well as; I. for at their coming a sheen
of; light burst from the/opened door be
low,'at which there were- sword" clank-
Ings'as.of armed-'men dismounting, and
then a few_low voiced words of welcome.
Followed quickly the closing of the door
and silence: and when my eyes grew onco
again accustomed to the gloom I saw.be
low the horses standing, head to head and
In- the midst a man to hold them. -^ :
5 ."So!".. I thought; "but three in all, and
one of them a servant. 'Twill be a scant
ly guested wedding." Andthen.I raged
within ,.againV : to think'bf how my^love
should â¢ be.' thus-, dishonored in a corner
when, she should have the -world to clap'
Its' hands and praise her beauty. -' \

was | banded | farther on by. two broad -
beams of light;" and then I knew my time
w'as*come.';.'V;. â¢Â¦ Â¦. I " . ". ' _â¢Â¦ Â¦ : : -
1 Feeling my>.way across the- darkened*
chamber, I softly 'tried the door latch.
It yielded. at the touch, but not the door.
I pulled, 'and braced myself . and pulled
again.- 'Twas but a waste of strength.
The" door was fast with that contrivance'
wherewith: my father used to bar me: in
what time I, was a boy and would, go
raccoonlng with our. "negro hunters.- My
enemy wasno fooL He had been shrewd
enough to lockme In against , the chance
of interruption. Â¦â¢ ' *- - . . - "
I wish' you might conceive the helpless
horror grappling with me" there behind
that fastened door; but this," indeed, you
may not, having felt . it -not For one
dazed moment I was sicR as death with
fear and frenzy and I ; - know not what
besides, and all the blackness of the night
swam sudden red before my eyes. Then,
in the twinkling of an eye; the madness
left. me sool and sane, as If the, fit had
been the travail pain of some new birth
of soul. And after that, as I "remember;
I knew not rage nor haste nor weakness
âknew no other thing save this: that I
had set myself a task to do and I would
do It. y : .
My window was in shape .ike half a
cell of honeycomb, and close beside It on
the outer wall there grew ah ancient ivy
vine which more than once had held my
weight whf n I *was younger and would
evade my father's, vigilance. .->
'I swung the casement noiselessly and
clambered out, with hand and foot In
proper hold as if those youthful flittings
of my boyhood days had been but yes
ternight. A breathless minute later I
was down "and afoot on solid ground: and
then a thing chanced which I would had
not. The man whom I had called a ser
vant turned and saw me. Â¦
"Halt! Who goes there?" he cried.
- "A friend," said I, between my wishings
for a weapon. For this servant of my pre
ngurings proved to be a trooper, booted,
spurred and armed. ' \ *'
"By God, I think you He." he said;. and
after that he said no more. â¢" for ' he "was
down among the horses', hoofs and I upon
him, kneeling hard , to scant his .breath
for shoutings. -" "..._. :- â¢ < .
It grieves' me now through all these
years to think that I did kneel tco hard
upon this man. He was. no enemy , of
mine, and did but doâ or seek to doâ his
duty. But he would flght or die, arid I
must fight or die; and so lten-Jed as such
strivings will, with, some grim crackling
of ribsâ and when I rose he rose not with
me.. -.' . . * Â¦, .- . ' .:. . "â¢Â¦
With all the fierce excitement, of ( the .
struggle yet upon me I stayed to knot
the bridle reins upon his arm to make it
plain that he had fallen at his" post. That
done I took his sword as -surer for < my
purpose than : a pistol; .and hugging Uhe
deepest , shadow of -,the wall, .afiproached
the. nearer^ window. It was open wide,
for. the night v.-as sultry warm, ahd-from
within there came 'the ""clink of jrlasses
ami now a toast and now a trooper's oath.
I drew myself by inches to" the case
ment, which was high,- finding seme' foot
hold in the wall; and when I looked with
in I saw no wedding guests," no- priest, no
altar; only this: a table in the midst with
bottles on" It. .and round It five men
lounging at their ease and drinking to -
the King. Of these five two.* the Baronet :
and .the lawyer, were known Â¦ to '. me," and
I have made them known to you. A third
I guessed j for Gilbert Stair. The other
two were strangers.
- -CHAPTER "VTL
IN. WHICH MY LADY HATH NCTPART.
Seeing that I had taken a man's life
for this,! the chance of looking in upon
a drinking bout, you will not wonder. that
I went aghast and would have fled for
verr shame had not a sudden weakness
seized me. But in the midst I heard- a
mention of, my name and so had leave, I
thought, to stay and listen.
It was one of the late comers who gave
me; this leave; a man well on In years,
grizzled and weather beaten; a seasoned
soldier by his look and garb. Though his
frayed- shoulder knot was only that of
a captain of foot, 'twas plain enough he
ranked his comrade and the knight as
weir;-: -. r
"> v^You say you've bagged this Captain
Ireton?.jWho may he be? Surely not old
Roger's son?" . . . .
:*ThÂ« lame." said the Baronet, shortly,
.and would be filling his glass again. He
' could always drink more and feel It less
than any sot I ever knew.
,"But;hpw the devil came he here? The
last, I knew of himâ 'twas some half score
years' agd, though, come to think â he was
a" lieutenant in the Royal Scots." 'Jj'
l * Mine enemy nodded. "So he was. But
afterward; he cut the service and levanted
, tti: tue Continent." . -
.-'.'What. brought him over seas. Sir Fran
cls?" â¢ "iSvas not the grizzled jester who
asked,', but < the younger officer, his com
rade-. Â¦. ,";"â¢
"'Falconnet smiled as onÂ« who knows a
thing. and will not tell and turned to Gll
-bert.Stalr.~ -
."rWhatjwas it, think you, Mr. Stair?" he
said,, passing the question on.
rAt->this. thÂ«y all looked to the master
of Appleby Hundred, and I looked to. He
â¢was not. the man I should have hit upon
in â¢any throng as the reaver of my father's
estate; still less the man who might be
Margery's father. He had the face of all
the Stairs of Ballantrae without Its sim
ple Scottish ruggedness; a sort of weasel
face it â¢was, wlth_pale. gray eyes that had
a? trick of. shifty dodging, and deen-.fur
rowed about the mouth and chin with
lines that spoke of .indecision. It was not
of him that Margery got her firm, round
chin,Vnor. aught of anything she owed a
father save only her paternity, you'd say.
And when. he spoke the thin falsetto voice
matched; the weak chin to a hair.
: f'.'I?, Damme, Sir Franci3, I know not
why The -cameâ how should I know?" he
quavered. ' "Appleby Hundred is mine â
mine. I tell you! His title was well
hanged on a tree with his damned rebel
father I' V
A laugh; uproarious from the three-sol
diers-greeted his petulant outburst; after
: which the^Baronet enlightened the others.
-."As 'you know. Captain John. Appleby
Hundred belonged to the rebel Roger
Ireton, and Mr. Stair here holds but a con
nscator's'title. 'Tia likely the son heard
of the: war and thought he stood some
chance to come Into his own again."
\"0h,"aye: sure enough," quoth the elder
officer, ~ tilting his bottle afresh. And
then:" "Of- course he promptly 'listed with
the rebels when he came? Trust Roger
Ireton's son for that."
My Baronet wagged his head assentingly
to this; then clinched the lie tn words.
.'" "Of course; we have his commission.
He is. on- De Kalb's staff, 'detached for
special duty." "
"A spy!"' roared the jeeter. "And yet
you f haven't hanged him?" â¢
..Sir 'Francis shrugged like any French
man. '"All; in good -time, my. dear cap
tain.: There -were treasons why I did not
care \ -to /knot the rope myself. Besides,
wV.had a:little disagreement years agone
across- the water; 'twas about a womanâ
cb/'.she'was no mistress of his, I do as
sure'you!'' â this to quench my jester's
'laugh : incredulous. '-"He was keen upon
me for .satisfaction In this old quarrel,,
and 'r gave" It him, thinking he'd hang the
easier for a little blooding first."
Here the factor-lawyer cut in anxiously.
"Bat"' you will hang - him. Sir Francis?
You've - promised that, you know."
I did not "hate my enemy the more be
cause, he turned a .shoulder to this little
bloodhound and quite Ignored the inter
ruption.'
""So" we "fought It out one morning in
Mr. Stair's woodfield, and he had what he
came' for. Not to give him a chance to
escape, '-.we brought him'' here, and
as soon as he Is fit to ride I'll
send him" to tha colonel. Tarleton
will, give him a short shrift. I
promise. you, and then" â this to the mas
ter of" Appleby Hundred â "then your title
will, be "well quieted, Mr. Stair."
At this the weather beaten captain roar
ed again and smote the table till the bot
tles-reeled.
' Haying "thus disposed of me they let
me be. and came to the graver business of
the moment, with a toast to lay the dust
before 1L It was Falconnet who gave
the. -toast.,
â¢ "Here's to our bally redskins and their
kingâ How. do you call him, Captain Stu
art? J pconâ Oconaâ " "
"Oconostota is the ChelakeÂ« of it.

' ''Obii "Lord!" groaned Falconnet. "I
say, captain, drown the names In the wine
and we'll drink them so. "Tis by far tha
easiest way to swallow them."
By this, the grizzled captain:* mention
of -the old Fort Loudon massacre I knew
him .for- that same John Stuart" of the
Highlanders who, with Captain Damare,
had so stoutly defended the frontier fort
against the savages twenty years before;

placed him. -.-Â¦ When" I was but a boy, as -I
could; well remember, he had been King's

wars a man the Indians feared.. But now,
as I wad 'soon to' learn, he was a man for
us to fear. ( " < Â¦ "
â¢. â¢â¢ â¢TiS'Carried through at last," he went
qn, when-the toast was drunk.. An then
he stopped .and held up a warning nn

"As â¢!' wa*s saying, the .Indians are at

council- at Echota,' the Chelakees being to
a man fierce enough to dig the. hatchet up.

with some new change of heart. He was
not over-squeamish as I had known htm.
Then I beard the Baronet say:
"But yet the thing Is done?"
"As good as done. The Indians are to
have powder and lead of us. after which
they make a sudden onfall on the over
mountain settlements. And that fetches
us to your part In it. Sir Frank; and to
-yours, Mr. Stair. . Your troop, captain,
will be the convoy for this powder; and
you, Mr. Stair, are requisitioned to pro
vide the commlssa/y."
There was silence while a cat might
wink, and then Gilbert Stair broke in
upon It shrilly:
"I cannot, -Captain Stuart; that I can
not!" he protested, starting from his
chair. " 'Twill ruin mÂ« outright' The
place Is strippedâ you know It well. Sir
Francis â stripped bare and clean by these
thieving rebel militiamen; bare as the
back of your hand. I tell you! I '*
But the captain put him down In brief.
"Enough, Mr. Stair; we'll not constrain
you against your will. Eut 'tis hinted at
headquarters that you are but a fair
weather royalist at bestâ nay. that for â¢
some years back you have been as rebel
as the rest in this nesting place
of traitors. As a friend â mind you. as a
friend â I would advise you to find the
wherewithal to carry out my Lord's com
mands. Do you take me, Mr. Stair?"
The trembling old man fell back In his
chair, nodding his "yes" dumbly like a
marionette when the string has been
jerked a thought too violently, and his
weasel face was moist and clammy. I
knew not what double dealing he would
have been at before this, but it was sure
ly something with the promise of a rope
at ttae publishing of it.
So be and his factor fell to ciphering on
a bit of 'paper, reckoning ways and means
as I took It, while Falcor.net was asking
for more particular orders.
"You'll have them from headquarters
direct," satd Stuart. "Oconostota will fur
nish- carriers, a Cherokee escort and
guides. The rendezvous will be here
abouts and your route will bÂ« the Great
Trace."
"Then we are to hold on all and wait
still longer?"
"That's the wordâ wait for the Indians
and your cargo."
Falconnet*s oath was of impatience.
"We've waited now a month and more
like men with halters round their necks."
The country la alive with rebels."
Whereupon Captain Stuart began to >
explain at large how the northern route |
had been chosen for its very hazards. I
the better to throw the partisans off
the scent. I listened, eager for
every word, but when the horse3
stirred behind me I was set back '
upon the oft-recurrent underthought of
how the gloom did also hide a silent fig
ure lying prone, with the three bridle
reins knotted round Its wrist.
The senior plotter had some map or
chart of his own making, and he was
pricking out on it for Falconnet the route
agreed upon in council with the Chero
kees.
At this cool outlaying of the working
plan, some proper sense of *rbat this p!ot
of savage-arming meant to evÂ«ry unde
fended cabin on the frontier seized and
thrilled me. I knew, as every border
born among us knew, the dismal horrors
of an Indian massacre: and this these
men wcr-i planning was treacherous mur
der of an unwarmed people. All was to
be done in midnight secrecy. Supplied
with ammunition, the Cherokee, led by
th!s Captain Stuart or some other, were
first, to fall upon the over-mountain settle
ments. These laid waste, the Indians
were to form a Junction with the army
of invasion, and so to add the torch and
tomahawk and scalping knife to British
swords and muskets.
It was a Dlot to make the blood run
cold In my veins, or In the veins of any
man who knew the cruel temper of these
savages, and when I thought upon the
fate of my poor countrymen beyond the
mountains I saw what lay before me.
The settlers must be" warned In time to
flght or fly.
But while I listened, with every faculty
alert to reckon with the task of rescue,
I take no shame In saying that the prob
lem balked me. Lacking the strength to
mount and ride in my own proper person. *
there was nothing for It but to find a
messenger, and who would he be in a re
gion at the moment distraught with I
war's alarms, and needing every man for
self-defense?
At that I thought of Jennifer. True,
he was wounded, too; but he would know
how best to pass the word to those in

SCHOLAR IN POLITICS
GIRL WHO SERVED TIME

K ES R5LJJI ever >'bodv smiles when his name is mentioned. To the

1 w? l!XlsJ 8 5C hÂ°Â°l * n a rolling-mil! â interesting, but incongruous.
ll'ffil.. Â¦Tiffin But when B. Franklin's father held that young gentleman
UHBOHaoau over the baptismal font while the family clergyman
sprinkled the front part of his name on convenient parts of the anatomy of
the helpless infant the doom of said helpless infant was fixed for keens.
Names have more influence in cuiding and directing the destiny of the
universe than any other one force, barring the Women's Christian Temperance
Union. It may.be true that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet:
but it is probably equally true that if the human race were to rise uo and de
cide to call or give the name rose to the malodorous and pervasive jimson
weed all the women in the United States would immediately declare they
had always preferred eau de jimsqn to white violet or pink carnation. Most
of us eat, drink and smoke names, paste names all over our religion, fall in
love with names â and call each other names when we fall out againâ and
envelop and pad ourselves with names generally.
Thus it wai that poor Benjamin Franklin was condemned by a heedless
father and a faithless old representative of the church to shy his mitt into
the political arena at the first opportunity. Of course as soon as he reached
the age of convictions he became firmly convinced that all politicians, from
the first serpent to the latest oostoffice clerk, have been shamelessly corrupt,
and alto, of course, he was of the opinion^ that the world had been sitting
around for some hundreds of centuries with all of its legs and arms hope
lessly out of joint waiting for B. Franklin to heave in sight and put a plaster
of paris cast on each of the corners.
In order to prepare himself for this exceedingly delicate operation in po
litical surgery he p u * in many weary hours in college wrapping his three
ply, silk-warp(ed) intellect around John Stuart Mill, Bryce's "American
Commonwealth" and other lieht works designed to give the inquiring mind
an upper hold on the problems of government. He had also taken a lone
course of maxillary gymnastics in the college debating society, doing the vo
cal giant swing and the forensic cut-off on such time-honored questions as the
following: Resolved. That the pen is mightier than the sword. Resolved.
That men of action have done more for the advancement of civilization than
men of thought. Resolved. That the hen is impelled to cross the road by
the unconscious sublimation of her ego; and other subjects more or less
fraught with importance to the human race.
As toon as he secured a firm hold on the little roll of parchment which
signified that under ordinary circumstances he could be depended on to pro
tect himself from the wet. Benjamin Franklin sallied forth to take the tired
old world by the hand and lead it to where it could sit down in comfort and
safety and let its feet hang over the edge. It was so delightfully simple that
he wondered often, far within himself, that no one had thought of saving
the country before he backed in. It hadn't occurred to him then, as it did
later, that the country had been saved, one way or the other, at least once
every two years for the last century or more. The trouble is that it won't
stay saved.
When B. Franklin returned to the city where he had chosen to be born
some twenty-three years previous he found the town trembling on the verge
of a campaign for Mayor. As usual, a great municipality was struggling
to free itself from the grasp of a band of shameless political bandits. Virtue
was out and vice was in; it's a peculiarity of virtue that it usually is out. If it
should ever succeed in getting itself elected to anything and making people
believe for any great length of time that it was the same old virtue they had
voted for, observant critics would begin to look for the curtain to go up on
the first act of the millennium. But unfortunately 'that happy event is al
ways just around the corner.
On his arrival B. Franklin thought that he could hear the city draw a
long breath of relief and pleased anticipation, and he forthwith proceeded to
unlimber his intellect and remove the tension from his vocal apparatus. He
was one of the first spellbinders at the post and got away well in the lead.
Every night he pervaded the stillyâ and breweryâ air with his silvery elo
quence, and every mornine the street-cleaning gang swept up great bunches
of persuasive arguments where B. Franklin had thrown them the nieht be
fore. All the wealth of ancient and modern history and literature was
drawn upon, and such a dazzling light was let in upon the darkened intel
lects of an enlightened constituency that green shades had to be furnished
with each and every address.
In the eyes of B. Franklin he was the whole thing and something over.
If the city could be saved he was the boy to do it. In his wandering fancy
he could see a grateful populace climbing the front steps of the Maison de
Stubbs bearing the thanks of the municipality on a platter. It was true that
there were one or two moments of disquiet. For example, he heard faint
but frequent rumors of what a certain gentleman with a name that ended in
"hooley" was doing for the party, and he had heard him referred to as the
boss, whatever that meant. But the name of B. Franklin, was ringing so
loudly through the cells of that gentleman's cerebellum that he couldn't bo
bothered with such vulgar things as "hooleys" and bosses.
By and bv the campaign came to an end, as. everything does except
Congressional investigations and postal indictments, and B. Franklin had the
limelight turned off and sat down to hear the returns. To his exceeding
great joy his particular brand of virtue finished about two lengths to the
good and vice slunk off with its tail between its' legs. But the thanks of the
municipality came not to B. Franklin, though he waited long and pa
tiently. Finally, in sheer despair, he journeyed down to headquarters to see
who was holding up the civic gratitude so shamelessly. Imagine his sur
prise, when he found out that the pure souled patriots in that stronghold of
political righteousness had never even heard of him. He, B. Franklin, the
silver-tongued orator, the lion-hearted savior of the city, was not even so
much as a name to these distinguished gentlemen. >>.
But while he hung around hoping to find some one who knew some one
who had heard his father's name he was compelled' to -witness the gratitude
that he was sure was marked with his name handed over; to a gentleman
with short hair and a mouth like the front door of, Â» rat trap, who sat in
the rear of a corpulent black cigar and took it all in without a word. This
unprepossessing person had a name that ended in "hooley." Later on B.
Franklin learned how the citv had been saved, and the other, fellow even told
him how much it had cost. Virtue comes high, but we must have it. ;*
B. Franklin monkeys no more, with the political buzz-saw, and he care
fully refrains from speaking except when he is spoken to. His lesson was
rather expensive, but he will never forget that while speech \ may be silver,
when it is entered in the political handicap it isn't even a hundred to one
against a properly gilded and prudently administered silence.

tmsxHam&cm MCE upon a time there lived in the town of Herkimer s
s^j^ieSfejjg^ geezer who possessed a wife named Cordelia and a
ta^B^a' f daughter named Fidelia. His tag read Luuan Lugsworth.
jgJ^^aH]. Lucian ran one of the leading stores in the town. Fact
MÂ£pffi>yÂ«ft is, he really had a shade the best of the other store for
(^igggpfreM the reason that he was more centrally located, bÂ«ing right
â^1_ _ â^ â lj across from the station.
One day after placing his order for fall Roods with
Isadore Rosenstein, who travels out of Cincinnati, Lucian asked him trp to â¢
meet the folks and take pot luck. Isadore, wise to the fact that it wu i
chance to make a three-base hit. accepted the invitation, and at toon a* he
pulled up at the house he began to eulogize Fidelia with such marked en
thusiasm that Cordelia was moved to ask Lucian if he waj sure he had ordered
enough from Mr. Rosenstein.
Isadore saw the opening at once and remarked that he thought Lucian
could use six dozen of those XL percale shirt waists to great advantage.
Lucian said make it three dozen and assort the sizes and patterns as much
as possible without disturbing: the cost mark. Isadore made a note of it on
his cuff and promptly changed the subject.
Then Fidelia gave her imitation of Little Eva. Isadore said that aj an.
imitatrix Fidelia made Cissie Loftus look like an amateur. Â¦ This caused
Lucian to Temember that he had clean forgot to order a dozen, pink bed
spreads. Isadore put it down and then the bell rang for supper.
When Isadore had gone Cordelia blew out the parlor lamp, folded up
the napkins, locked the silver butter dish in the safe and called Lucian into
the back room to talk matters over.
She told him she had been deeply impressed by what Mr. Rosenstein had
said about Fidelia's talents: that she knew every word' he had uttered was
gospel truth, for he was highly educated and a most perfect gentleman.
Indeed, he had simply said what she had always known was a fact. After
sparring along that line for a while, she up and said she had set her mind on
sending Fidelia to one of them boarding schools where girls are taught Latin,
Greek, music, art, expression and citified manners.
Lucian came back at her ,by saying that while the crop reports were
powerfully discomforting and "collections very slow, he warn't going to raise
his voice agin what was for the good of his own child, so Cordelia went to
the bookcase and dug up a stack of catalogue* from the leading thought fac
tories.
After studying the fine points of each school, Cordelia and Lucian came
to the conclusion that the Martha Washington Seminary was the best. The
catalogue -said jo. To prove it, the book called attention to the fact that the
Martha Washington Seminary is ' located 444 feet above the level of the sea
on the very spot where nature has most lavishly bestowed her bounties; where
the birds are moved to perpetual song; the death-dealing germ is a curiosity;
the cuisine is unsurpassed: the salubrious mountain air lingers from Septcm-
Ikrr the 17th to June the 21st, and the daily programme is as follows:
Rise at 7, bathe and dress. Study, 4 to 5.
Breakfast, 8. Gymnasium, 5 to 5:30.
Study, 9 to II. Bible study, 5:30 to 6.
Recitations, 11 to 12:3a Dinner, 6:30.
Luncheon, 12:30 to I. Study, 7 to 8.
Recitation, 1:30 to 4. Prayers, 8 to 8:3a
Retire, 9.
The book went on to say that the Martha Washington Seminary Is
equipped w'ith a chemical laboratory, tennis court and Christian influence.
Well, to get to the point, Fidelia's trunk was packed with sheets, pillowr
cases ( hot water bags, talcum powder, scented soap and other feminine un
mentionables, and she took the cars to the informatory.
â¢ After serving eight months at what she termed hard labor. Fidelia went
back to Herkimer with nothing to show for if except a beribboned mando
lin, a Yale flag, a college yell and a bunch of slang.

'of a 5-year-old. VHe's a' perfect cherub,"

She had reached the mature age of 25

lady In black, coming up with a rush
after painful Indecision In crossing, "how
dared you disobey me? Have you thanked
the kind gentleman properly? Which Is
he, Allena?" M^ Â¦ __
"He's gone!" answered her chars*, with
a wall of disappointment, her glance
roving through the crowd. "Oh, dear! I
didn't even find out his name. Tve got his
picture, though, to remember him by.
See Charlotte."
The governess gazed and bit her lip. "A
pretty hard face," she murmured.
"It Isn't!" cried Allena In wrath. "It
was Just saintly when I kissed him."
"You kissed him! You dreadful child!
Come home at ,once. You! Judge Race

have had consumptionâ orâ or germs. He
may have given them to you!"
"He gave me his picture, anyway, and
you and your old germs can go to pot."
retorted Allena, impolitely. "Say. you
needn't drag me along, Charlotte Spicer.
I can walk."
"Curly" stood Irresolutely In front of
the saloon. The crowd Jostled him, but
he did not move along. A flashily dressed
man seized his arm.
"You're shaky : this morning, boy." he
accosted cordially. "Let's get Inside. I'll
break a small bottle with you. That will
put you on your feet."
"I'm on mv Â¦ fÂ«et now," returned *the

track.
"Curly" did not quit* comprehend how
he had done it Just an instinctive leap,
a clutch at the pink frock, and th* trol

girl from him. with a flash of thought
that he, himself, was gone.
Voices cursing the' motorman, who was
not In the least at fault; voices and hands
applauding hummed In his ear without
meaning, as he straightened up with a
long breath of relief, his eyes on her
grateful, childish face.
"Marry me, eh?" he whispered, mis
chievously, as he dlzlntanfled th* cling-'

pulling from his breast pocket an en

from a rather soiled bunch. "Here! Take

The muscular figure straightened with
a half friendly, half -warning flash in the
gray eyes.
A strong momentary pressure of fingers,
which were quick at dealing poker hands,
and Shipman' s broad shoulders strung
down the street.
"Beats me!" meditated his sporting
friend, and swore softly. "Maybe he la

curly-headed, gray-eyed scamp; bright as

When the visitor emerged from ta* II*
brary after that hour of rapid conversa
tion he went straight to the drawing
room, and his host, with a puzzled vLj
age, pattered upstairs.
Shipman stood under the great chande
lier, a bronzed, well-formed man. the
rings of clustering hair loir on his broad
brow. He trembled at the sound of soft
approaching steps.
"My father said you wished to speak
with me." came a clear voice, as a girl,
tall, bright-eyed and sunny haired came
quickly in without embarrassment, look-
Ing at him keenly.
"I do." replied the stranger. "I have
every day for tea years prayed tor Â«*'Â«
meeting, that I might *frfcnft you."
"Thank me!" starting, "and for what
please? Oh!" sha cried. "Iâ I do know
you, now. You are my picture. X have It

"Of course, I do." Allena's cheeks wer*
glowing. "Let us sit down. Dear me! I
don't even know your name." W
"Shipman. Tod Shipman of Colorado
Springs."
"Oh!" she gazed at him interestedly.
"That day." began the man, his ton*
reverent, "the trustful embrace of a little
child turned my steps. During all my
struggle her face has been ever before me
âan inspiration. I have been true to It.
It has been my one thought to live and
work for this date, this anniversary, that
I might tell her what she did. You do not
seem strange to me. but as I expected to
find you. Good-by! May God bless you."
, "But you will come again!" cried the
girl, giving him her hands as he rose.
"If I do," the deep voice trembled, "you
âyou will understand."
The fair head drooped and nodded al
most imperceptibly. Her fingers tight
ened on his. He bent his lips to them, and
stepped softly away.
"Mrs. Todd Shipman." murmured Al
lena. as the heard the front door dose.
"Quite an attractive name."
"Thank you for that, missy," he said.
as he locked up with tears In his eyes.

ce j., . f ;tn attack.. Two hours had passed
Quietly away vhrn ten Eloux warriors
â¢j'j: : Â¦â¢" the party. They attacked sud
denly Â«nd with whoops and yells, and the
sergeant's guard was thrown Into a panic
s-afi ran away. All rallied after a short
fightâ al! but Hogan. He was thoroughly
frlghic-ned and continued his flight for a
mile. Then his Irish courage returned
and he forced his legs to take his body
back, and he arrived just In time to help
his comrades out of a bad fix. A citizen
ajzi a soldier had been killed and a second
Midler wounded, and Sergeant Davleon
Quaked as he thought of the report he
oust make to his colonel. There was only
cae way to excuse his carelessness and he
seized upon it.
In due course of time Private Hogan
was court martlaled for cowardice. He
bad run away from the enemy and left
his comrades to fight It out. True, they
frÂ«* run also, headed by the sergeant, and
It was also true that Hogan returned at
â¢ critical stage and fought well, but fhe
sergeant riled It on to him at the trial
and made out a bad case against him. He
Bust save his neck by putting the rope
around another's, and the sentence was
that Private Hogan be dismissed from the
irsy for cowardice.
Two weeks later he was escorted to the
gate cf the fort one afternoon and toTd
to go. As he left the rate the disgraced
man turned toward Wolf Creek and
walV:e;l away without once looking back.
Be had made a poor defense, but he knew
that he was no coward and that he had
been sacrificed to save the sergeant. To
be thus dismissed from the army meant
that he must get out of the country. As
a branded coward even the squaws of the
half breeds would be licensed to eplt upon
him.
Tb"ere was but one house at the crossing
cf Wolf Creekâ that of the Widow
Thompson. She had lived there with her
daughter Mary, now a girl of 20. for three
or four years past, furnishing meals to
the teamsters and being the only post
master for marjf miles around. Several
soldiers at the Â»*fort were "sweet" on
Mary, but Sergeant Davleon was sup
posed to have the call over them all. His
terra of service would be out In less thaa
a year and in his own mind be arranged
to marry Mary and settle down on the
ranch. It had been long since the Sioux
raided up Smoky Valley, but there was
- no telling when they might come again,
and a beacon had been prepared by the
soldiers for the women to light In case
they needed help night or day.
When Hogan reached the postofflee he
sat dewn on the doorsteps and let his
chin fall Into his hands and did some
thir.klng. By and by the girl came out
and found him there. She had heard of
his trial and sentence and she pitied him.
"I suppose you despise me, the same as
the rest?" he said as he knew of her
presence, but without locking up.
"You have been drummed out?" she
queried In turn.
"Aye! drummed out and disgraced for
ever. I'm more of an object of contempt
than a squaw man. Why don't you order
rse to go on?"
"See here. Hogan, I'm sorry for you,"
she said as she laid a hand on his arm.
"You ralght have lost your head for a
time, but that wasn't cowardice."
as she waved her hand In gay farewell tha
train pulled out of the station.
The world seemed suddenly flat to him,
"And I didn't get her London" address!"*
he exclaimed aloud, as his stupidity
dawned upon him. "Well, I'll be hanged!"*
Two years later the servants of Fair
acre received notice from their youni
mistress of her Intention of opening the
house for a few weeks. The old place
had been closed since her early childhood.
Tears rose In her eyes as she was driv
rn up to her own door. How well she
remembered the quaint supporting pillars,
Ing to me that you might have made a
stronger defense at the trial."
"Yes, I could have said more," he
mused as he nodded his head, "but a
scapegoat was wanted and I was new to
the company and had no chums. "Miss
Mary, I'm a mind toâ. -6ut let it go.
I'm citizen Hogan, the coward, and will
be till I'm 600 miles away and among men
who'll never hear of this. If they'd only
have sent me to the guardhpuse for six
months and Elven me another chance!"
"Don't fret over it," soothed the girl.
"But to call me a cowardâ me, an Irish
manâand to prove it against me! I can't
abide It. missyâ I can't do it. Jf I only
had another show I'd make 'em sing a
different tune. I'm disarmed and dis
graced and turned out, but I'd go for the
Sioux with a club if the Lord would only
send 'em this way."
"But that can't happen, and I'm telling
youâ"
She was interrupted by shouts and shots
and the clatter of hoofs and next moment
the soldier mall rider appeared around the
bend of the road forty rods below. He
was lying down and clinging to his horse's
neck, and behind him were twenty hos
tiles on their ponies.
"Into the house, missyâ In for God's
sake!" eboutcd Hogan as he sprang up
and pushed her before him and barred
the door.
A Winchester rifle hung on the wall In
the public room and almost before tho
girl and her mother could realize what
had happened Hogan had fired from a
window and tumbled the leading Indian
off his pony. At that same instant the
horse of the mall rider fell at the door
and his wounded owner was flung to tho
earth.
"I've baited the red devils for a, mo
ment." said Hogan to the women, "and
now to get the man In before they lift
his scalp. Take the rifle and cover me
as I make a dash." â¢ . *
A score of bullets were flred at him by
the circling Indians as he sprang from tha
door and seized the wounded man and
bore him Inside, but he escaped them all.
The mall rider was a soldier from his own
company and had been shot in the back
as he rode. When stretched on the floor
Inside and whisky forced between his
teeth he opened his eyes and looked
about him and said:
"^id this Is you, Hogan, the man they
call a coward! Damn me, but there's not
a man in the fort with your pluck! Jt
was thrown away, though, as I haven't
got an hour to live. The Sioux arc on
the warpath again and there's twenty In
the party out yonder. Nothing can save
you hereâ not even the signal flre."
It was 3 o'clock of a June afternoon
when the Indians appeared, and all thn:
long afternoon, with the mail rider lying
dead In the house, Hogan and the women
stood the warriors off. There were three
different rushes, but each one was hand
ccmely repulsed with rifle and revolvers.
But from various points encircling the
house there was a hostile flre, which
made a sieve of the adobe and wounded
all three of the defenders. It was when
darkness was drawing down that the
Coward said:
"When night nets In they'll have Us for
sure. I must light the signal flre. Hold
the door for me, missy, and the mother
must cover me from the window. If I go
down, then God take care of you."
No man could ever figure out how it was
done, with the redskins thick about the
house and on the watch for just such a
move, but Hogan dodged past them and
fired the beacon and regained the house,
though struck by two bullets as he en
tered It. It was Ms end. He looked up
with a smile as Mary held his hand, and
his last words were:
"I wanted a chance, and the Lord gave
it to me."
The Indians fled as the signal flre blazed
up. and half an hour later Sergeant Davl
eon and six troopers rode up to find the
two wounded women weeping over the
dead.
"This Is Haggerty, the mall rider." said
the sergeant, as he looked at the first
corpse, "but who may this be In citizen's
dress and with three or four wounds?"
"That/* said Mary, as she looked up
through her tears, "that Is Hogan the
Cowardâ a better man than you ever will
be."
She smiled into the honest eye*, so like
those bf the child In the picture- "Yes,"
she said, "for the sake of littl* David's
successor."
The last day came, and David walked
over for a farewell visit. Ha found Patty
alone on -the vine-shaded porch. John
was away on business, she explained.
"Never mind." David said cheerfully, "It
Is you I wish to seel" Her clear eyes
were raised to his inquiringly.
"Will you keep your word?" he said
gently, "and take me?"
"My word!" she murmured, wonder
lngly.
"Yes; before I saw you I heard you
tell Lizzie that you were corning down
stairs and you would take me yourself."
There was a mischievous light la Ms eye
now.
Patty's face Gushed. "You know I didn't
mean â " she began.
He Interrupted her anxiously. "But you
will take me. dearâ on trialâ for the sake
of little David?"
"Yes." that's so; but since then" (and
he glanced quickly at Patty) "I've made
other arrangements. My brother and I
are partners and Jim Is willing that X
should have my summer vacation now."
"Oh I" Patty cried. "I'm so glad!
Aren't you, John?"
v "Yes," he said heartily, but this sudden
change of plans made him suspicious.
David made good use of those four
weeks. His grandmother laughingly Ac
cused him of spending half, of his vaca
tion with the Sayblns.
"Twenty-seven," Patty answered, de
murely, and John exploded with laughter.
"No good pretending. Patty," he cried,
"better show him all of my old posses
sions. Including the trundle bed, but we'll
not ask him to occupy It."
The morning of the golden wedding
dawned clear and bright. It was a day
filled with happiness for all who gathered
at the old home. At 10 that night David
Terrell gave John and Patty a full account
of "the gathering of the clans," as he
called It. In conclusion, he said. "I shall
have to ask you to keep me another night,
but after that there will be room for me
at Elm Dale."
"I thought you said you must go to
morrow!" John exclaimed.
Late In the evening they adjourned to
the dining-room for a little lunch. Patty
had forgotten the high chair and Its ac
companiments, and It was with a feeling
of dismay that she saw their visitor's
eyes traveling in that direction.
"Are these things for my use?" he ask
ed laughingly.
"What things?" Patty said Innocently.
"This high chair, tin tray and so on."
"Oh," she said, with a guilty glance
at John. "Those belong to my brother.**
John stared at her In amazement. HI*
face grew crimson with suppressed mirth,
v.hen Mr. Terrell said, "How old Is your
little brother?"
like the little fellow's. "I am glad that
you came." she said hospitably. "My
brother and I are often lonely, and John
will be delighted to entertain some one of
his own axe. I hear him coming now."
and aha rose. and went to the door to
meet him. "John." David heard her say,
"Mr. Terrell la here."
"Mr. Terrell ?" the answer came, "and
who is he. Patty T'
"Hush! He'll hear us; It Is little Da

slapped her hand Into his and led him to
the sitting-room, and in the few min
utes the three young people were on the
short road to friendship.
high chair and trundle bed* were brought
down from the attic and dusted. Lizzie,
the good-natured girl In the kitchen, made
some little. round cakes and Patty frosted
them and put a pink "D" on the top of
two or three. When evening came every
thing was In readiness for the expected
guest. The tin waiter and tiny knife, fork
and plate were on the dining-room table,
and the little rocker held out Us welcom
ing arms in the sitting-room. An old
rocking horse (that had been John's Irmg
ago) waited. patiently for its gallant rider,
and a little woolly dog stood on three legs
with an air of expectation.
The day had been a long one to Patty.
At 7 o'clock she was rearranging: the fur
niture In little David's room when the
doorbell ran*. She went to the head of
the stairs and called to Lizzie.
"Hurry. Lizzie!" she cried, ."they've
brought little David over. Take him into
the sitting-room and amuse hint. I'll be
down in a few minutes." She flitted back
to her work and did not hear Lizzie's ex
clamation of . astonishment when she
opened the door and saw a big. broad
shouldered man standing there. Probably
he had overheard Patty's Instructions to
the girl, for his eyes wero mil of laugh
ter, though he said soberly enough.
"Good evening. I am David Terrell. Miss
Saybln was expecting me, I believe?"
"Y-y-yes, sir," Lizzie stammered, "but
she wasn't expectln' Quiteâ" she paused
In embarrassment.
"Quite as much of me?" he .asked,
laughingly.
Lizzie giggled and led the way Into the
sitting-room. The little chair held out Us
welcoming arms In vain to this guest. Da
vid Terrell's eyea rested at onco upon the
rocking horse and woolly d'osr and his ex
pression momentarily grew more cheer
ful.
"Were theseâ ahemâ these preparations
made In my honor?" fie- asked Lizzie. But
before the girl could answer a sweet voice
came from the upper landing; "Are you
amusing him, Lizzie?"' Lizzie giggled
hysterically.
"Tell her you are." the young man
â¢whispered. "Yes"!:!," she called In muf
fled tone* from behind her apron,
i "Show him the picture books," the voice
went on. "and If the little fellow Is tired
take him up la your lap."
Lizzie stepped Into the lower hall and
turned her laughing face up to her mis
tress. "Please, ma'am, I can't," she said,
â¢Td hate to try."
"I'm ashamed of you!" the Indignant
reply came. "I'll come right down and
take him myself."
Lizzie had fled to the kitchen and there
waa the Quick click of heels on the stairs.
Then David Terrell saw a pretty picture
framed In the wide doorway. Miss Patty
stood there with surprise and. disappoint
ment plainly written on her expressive
face.
"Whereâ where Isâ" she began In a
bewildered way.
David came forward. "I don't know
where be Is," he said. "lf I did. Td get
him for you. Miss Saybln."
"You?" Â«he asked.
"Yes, I'm little David's successor. Will
you forgive me for growing older and
larger. Miss Saybln?"
For a moment the sensitive mouth quiv

she held out her hand and said with a
smile, "I suppose you can't help It, but
you don't look much like your picture."
"Oh, that's ltl Grandmother showed

Patty nodded and smiled again. After
all, this David had pleasant eyes, Quito

"Ten Thousana a Year," the ever popu

which we have read upon the advice of

rus Townsend Brady, the prolific-' writer
of good stories, has recognized in the old
tale matter as well suited to present day,
needs as it was fifty years ago. and has
abridged and raised Dr. Samuel Warren's
book under the name of "Tittlebat Tit
mouse." To the text have been added so
many illustrations from the pencil of Will
Crawford that the good old. story which
made its first appearance In Blackwood's

In an introduction . Mr. Brady. - thus
gives his reasons for giving the old story

"I first read 'Ten Thousand a Year* In

becoming more and more to be merely a

Nobody thought of having an American

under Japanese conditions until Onoto

"a fascinating compound of American
beauty and Japanese , education." as a

"Napoleon Bonaparteâ A History Writ

which first appeared in the American
Boy, will be published at an early date
by the A. Wessels Company. The author
has selected the Incidents which attract
and Interest boys and history has not been
distorted merely to add interest to the
narrative. A number of good reproduc
tions of famous paintings Illustrating Na
poleon's career have been Inserted, which
makes altogether a volume Interesting,
Instructive and attractive.
In "The Backgrounds of Literature,
the latest work to come from the pen
of Hamilton Wright Mabie. is at the
same time a noteworthy contribution to
American criticism and a beautful addi
tion to any library shelf. The work con
tains a series of chapters upon Words
worth, Scott. Irving, Walt Whitman and
others In which Mr.- Mabie endeavors to
follow out In these specific Instances the
esthetic law of the effect of environment
upon art.. He shows how the beautiful
lake country of Westmoreland colored
the genlous of Wordsworth; how Scott
drank in his poetry from the hills and
glades of Abbotsford. What were the
Highlands to Washington Irving and the
hills of Massachusetts, to Emerson are
the questions which Mabie has set him
self to expound In this series of literary
studies. â¢ . â¢
The book Is beautifully printed at the

OWEN KILDARE. ex-pugillst. ex
"bouncer" for Bowery dives and
emancipated street brat, has writ
ten a story in "My Mamie Rose" which is
well worth the reading. It has a unique
place In bookdom In that It Is the only
true picture of the life of the other half
In New York, for it Is written by one
who was of the other half. The author
has only to review his own life in the
slums of the metropolis and thus uncon- ,
sciously give a picture of correctness of
detail v.hich cannot be caught by those
who go down into the tenements, strive
earnestly though they may.
VMy Mamie Rose" is not a novel. It Is
the stralghtf orward Btory of the regen
eration of Owen Kildare, who. at the age
of 30. could not write his name nor read
anything besides the black headlines of
the papers he had once peddled; who had
fought forty-round "goes" with hood
lums In the back rooms of Bowery sa
loons; who had been a "steerer" for con
fidence men and dlvekeepers. It Is a
work of heartfelt appreciation dedicated
to the woman who had used her Influence
In drawing the Bowery tough Into higher
and sweeter planes of life and setting
him upon a career of probity and useful
ness.
Klld&re thus defines the purpose of his
book: "To tell the plain truth about
men and things as I saw them In the
homes of the tenements; to show that
often their hearts hunger more than their
stomachs." With this end in view Kil
dare proceeds to give his reader an un
varnished picture of life in. the East Side
âbrutal even at times, but terribly con
vincing. How the street waif has to
fight for his crust; how the hoodlum has
to "graft" for his dally potions of beer,
the grimness and sordldness of tt all Is
told In a style to which the author had
to school himself when a man almost In
middle life. . ; . . ';
The author tells with touching grate
fulness of his meeting with the little col
lege settlement school teacher, who was
to be the Instrument of his regeneration,
of the healthful influence which she ex
erted over him and finally of the primer
lessons which he learned at her direction.
The story of the death of the woman who
bad led him up from the tenements and
who was within a week of her end to be
his wife, Kildare, tells with a sentiment
which falls from the pen of an ex-prize
fighter with a sweetness little short of
the marvelous.
"My Mamie Rose" Is a strong book.
Owen Kildare is a very strong man. To
him and to his book much praise Is due.

/r Is usually considered a. dangerous
thing for an author to revive a char
acter or write a sequel. Too often
the demand of the book readers
prompts the writer to undo all of his
former success by making a character
"bleed to death." aa some critic charac
terized the fate of Barrle's boy hero In
"Tommy and Grizel." But F. Hopkinson
Smith has given ua that rare old Colonel
Carter again and he Is thrice welcome.
"Colonel Carter's Christmas" Is but a
little story, one of the first of the sea
son's Christmas books; but It Is dainty
and told with all of the skill that Is Hop
kinson Smith's.
Colonel Carter is undeniably the best
of Mr. Smith's creations. Nobody else
save Thomas Nelson Page could draw
such a charming sketch of the rare old
Southern cavalier, penurious In the evil
days which have come upon him since
the war, of unbending honor and yet so
full of genial kindliness and the courtly
grace of the old school. Like Page, Smith
writes of a type fast fading before the
advance of time and circumstance, but
he fixes him as a permanent figure In
American fiction, lovable and dear to the
hearts of the reader as old Colonel New
come.
In his latest story about the old Vir
ginian the author has adopted the trick
of contrast to throw h'.s character into
the light. Opposed to the simple gener
osity and almost childlike ingenuousness
of Colonel Carter is the carefully drawn
portrait of Mr. Klutcbem, the money
blinded, sordid old New York stock gam
bler. Throughout the greater length of
the tale these two characters are brought
Into sharp clash. By the grasping, intol
erant nature of the one, the fiery. In
domitable EPirit of the other Is thrown
Into the fore.
But a Christmas story must not be
unpleasant and from the battle of the
stock exchange Hopkinson Smith there
fore shifts the last chapters of his little
tale to the interior of Colonel Carter's
modest yet cherry little abiding place In
the great metropolis. Here the colonel
Is st bis best and his rare good heart
permits of his receiving as a Christmas
guest the man whom he had formerly
fcwern to call out on the field of honor.
Rarely has any author given a scene
eo simple and yet eo delicate in Its sig
nificance as that of- the lighting of the
Christmas candles. To read this Is to
hope that there are a few Colonel Car
ters In real life whose sterling hearts
beat for all that Is true and noble in what
too often seems a sordid world.

JTRANGE It is that In the revival of
the romantic in story telling, which
had Its inception with Weyman's
first works, the new school did not as a
rule go as far back Into the days of chiv
alry as Sir Walter Scott, their great pre
cursor. We have had stories of Cavalier
and Roundhead galore, tales of Richelieu
and the Bourbons and colonial plots ad
nauseam, out, into the days of , Ivanhoe
our modern * romanticists have rarely
a.pp*Â»Â«1. "Uther and Ingralne," a novel by
Wat ck Deeping, has supplied the va
cant/. . '
Taking the period of the great wars
with the Saxons, before King Arthur's
time even, Mr. Deeping has projected a
stirring story against the background of
rapine and conquest. The hero of the
novel. "Uther," a dim, seml-hlstorical,
semi-mythological personage of the sto
ried valor of a Beowulf, Is displayed by
the author as a figure of striking person
ality, endowed with a heroic sense of
patriotic obligation to his folk. The her
oine Is an Impassioned and beautiful crea
ture, half wild, yet wholly "womanly.
The story of her battle against the tragic
temperament which she has Is stirringly
told.
Movement there Is to the story, ro
mance and action, too, but without any
sacrifice to the dramatic interest of the
tale there Is a subtle,' poetic effect which
brings to mind that other strong tale of
chivalry, "The Forest Lovers." The novel
has a refreshing note of the wild, and
primitive In I* which comes as a pleasant
relief to the monotony of'court furbelows
and colonial Indian fights which has been
these many seasons oppressing us.

"Pa Gladden" Is a story of a simple
man told in a simple style by Elizabeth
Cherry Waltz. Very like "Eben Hol
den"-In ' places, reminding one at times
of "David . Harura," this recountal
of the simple life of a plain old man yet
has something new and refreshing In It.
It breathes of the sweet, God fearing life
of the country, far removed from the
crash and brassiness of the great cities.
Only . a slender thread of plot . . runs
through the book, lust enough upon
Tvhlchito. hang the character delineation
of Pa Gladden. We are shown the sim
ple generosity and. kindliness of the child
less old man and his wife toward all.
"Pa's" harness never galls his horses,
nor Is his door closed to the homeless.
Mingled with his homely humor and sim
ple sentiment there Is a naive belief In
the supernatural which cas^s over the
character the quaint light of old time su
perstition.
"This- is a aueer old world." says Pa
Gladden, "but God made a few of the
folks In It.*-' The world and the Almighty
are the two mainsprings of the old gen
tleman's life. The world for the good
that he, can do in It and the i^mlghty In
whose trust he does it.

Mrs. Mary E. Wllkins-Freeman, whose
"Pembroke," "Jerome," and other stories
are known -far and wide among the best
In the language, has had some curious
psychological experiences In writing them.
For Instance, she once wrote a story of
a man who sat on the church steps be
cause he had a grievance and was too
angry to enter. After it was published
the author was lnformed^to her surprise,
that such an incident had actually oc
curred. Then, again, when Mrs. Wllkins-
Freeman wrote "Silence," which Is a story
of the Deerneld massacre, she learned
after Its appearance that a woman named
Silence- had actually lived In Deerneld
at the time, and one of her descendants
asked Miss Wilklns If the story had been
written of her; but the author had known
nothing about her. Another still more
uncanny example was the following: In
"The Little Maid In the Door," a short
story of the Salem witchcraft period, Mrs.
Wllkins-Freeman had placed a turn In
the road at a certain house described In
the. story, and afterward discovered that
there was a turn In the old road at that
identical point.

Adrian Hoffman Jollne, author of "The
Meditations 'of an Autograph Collector,"
has written another volume of delightful
chat about booksâ of authors, collectors,
fine bindings, odd and curious editions of
sundry works and many anecdotes â which
the Harpers are publishing uniform with
the "Meditations." The new book Is en
titled "The Diversions of a Book Lover."
Mr. Jollne Is a partner in the New York
law firm of Butler, Notman, Jollne Sc
Mynderse. Mr. Butler, now dead, was
the famous author of "Nothing to Wear."
Mr. Jollne is a member of the University,

City Bar Association. He belongs also
to the New York, Virginia and New Jer
sey Historical societies.
with the years, some lose their point by
the change of customs or the trend of
popular thought, but the wit of "Phoe
nlxiana" is as fresh after Its years of
desuetude as it was on the day when it
glinted from the pages of the inky old
newspapers. He has burlesqued even the
medium for the expression of his own
wit â the penny-a-liner â as fruitful a
source of caricature In our own day as
then. He gives us exaggerated literary
and dramatic criticisms. He distorts the
circumlocution of officialism and the dry
grubbings of scientific bodies In a man
ner as spontaneously rippling and fresh
with fun as anything of our modern hu
morists.
"Phoenlxiana" is not like anything else
in American humor. It has not the coarse
ness and horse play of "Artemus Ward":
It depends not upon down East dialect
and seedy grammar for its charm as did
"Eli Perkins": it does not carry a polit
ical sting as do the writings of "Petro
leum V. Nasby," or the classic "Blgelow
Papers" of Lowell. Though not of the
grade of Mark Twain's immortal writ
ings, the papers of "John Phoenix" have
much the same stamp. They depend upon
burlesque and exaggeration for their
mirthful qualities. Like Twain's fun,
the laugh in "Phoenlxiana" is a frankly
hearty one and has no trace of sneer.
The author Is caught In his most prank
ful mood In the opening skit of the vol
ume, which purports to be the report of
Professor John Phoenix upon the recon
noissance of the possibilities of a railroad
route from San Francisco to Mission Do
lores. This uproarious piece of humor
detailing the movements of a surveying
party which marches down Kearny street
as. If traversing a Siberian wilderness Is
not exceeded by anything in American
humor. One feels like lying down and
taking a roll when he reads of the ef
forts of Dr. Heavysterne to compute the
time of day by watching the transit of
the 6un across the nve bars of a grid
iron. Or again the reader goes off into
floods of tears when "John Phoenix"
gravely reports upon the soundings of the
Kearny street mud in bad weather.
With "Phoenix" Installed as the editor
of an Imaginary San Diego Herald, the
reader is treated to a burlesque on stren
uous journalism, of the old school very
much like Mark Twain's Inimitable sketch
of "Journalism In Tennessee." The old
reader of "Phoenlxiana" will tell you that
the persistence of the Jovial army lieu
tenant in dubbing the city of the south
"Sandyago" won him some bitter ene
mies. Perchance some of the encounters
of "John Phoenix," the editor, had more
foundation In fact than would appear at
first' sight. ' '; '.
In fact," the story, Is current that young
Lieutenant Derby came near court-mar
tial as the result of his irrepressible hu
mor. . As the tale goes, when Jefferson
Davis was Secretary of War he sent to
the engineers of the army In California
for suggestions as to the most feasible
method of transporting artillery over the
mountains. The hare brained "John Phoe
nix" forwarded to the fiery Southern Sec
retary a very grave suggestion, illus
trated by charts, which urged that each
private should be provided with a leather
seat to his trousers having a hook at
tachment, so that In emergencies the com
mon fighting man could be. harnessed to
the cannons. .'
Derby escaped with nothing more than
a severe reprimand, however, and lived
to do effective service In engineering work
on the coast of Florida before his death
In 1861. But his lighthouses cannot be
better than his book. Completely rfS ar ;

Â¦ In view of the probable consideration
of the question of financial legislation by
Congress this year, special interest will
attach to Mr, Wilbur Aldrich's new book,
"Money and Credit," published by The
Grafton Press. This is a simple but sci
entific work dealing with the principles
and history of . money and showing the
development of the rise and the nature
of, credit. The laws of the subject are
deduced from their, historical sources, one
by one. In order to establish clearly their
truth and the whole Is done with a terse
ness and lucidity of style that add a
striking merit. For the student, the man
of affairs, the banker and the legislator,
es well as for the average reader who de
sires to gain a knowledge of the underly
ing principles of banking and subjects al
lied thereto, "Money and Credit" is one
of the best works thus far published. As
a treatise on the subject of credit alone,
it is the most valuable work of its kind
In the English language.
Mr. Aldrich has written what he has
to say so simply and clearly that It is
easily within the comprehension of any'
one, whether versed in "monetary lore or
not. The work, which has recently been
revised to bring it thoroughly up to the
needs and conditions of to-day, has al
ready evoked words of approval from
members of the finance r committee of
Congress and from leading financial
journals. The lucidity of the exposition
and the soundness of the argument, to
gether with the simplicity of treatment,
should recommend this book to all think
ing persons, directly or indirectly Inter-;
ested In the economic aspects of finance.

Others imagine tt has been written by

"Little Leaders." : We understand, how
ever, that "The Mills of Man" was really
written by Mr. Philip Payne, a Chicago
newspaper man, who in this book makes
hln entrance into fiction.
The story shows that Mr. Payne Is Inti
mately acquainted with the social and po
litical life of the great city and has the
power. to create characters that live and
move and fix themselves In one's mem
ory. The book Is particularly strong in
characterization, which Is a genuine
blessing : In these days of fictional plots
and counter plots. The reading public
will do well If it distinguishes between

the life of the city.

It was away bactf in the early '50' s that
Lieutenant George H. Derby came to
California with hi? detachment of the
United States Army. First he was
located in San Francisco, but later
was transferred to the army post at
San Diego. Before he had been on
the coast Fix months his fun began
to break through the 6evere restraints
of army discipline and the sketches
of "John Phoer.lx" began to appear
in the pioneer press of the time. By
their bubbling fun and riotous wealth
of humor the skits began to attract uni

books, the once popular volume sank into

"I think I know why. Last time I. was

As be concluded Hailey, was climbing
behind his father into the smoker, j Num

"I think I know why they did It," Bucks
eald slowly, "but! couldn't tell Halley."
"Ed," Halley raised his voice at the
foreman, "will you get those stay bolts
and chuck them into the baggage car for
me on Number Two? I'm going over to
the house for. a minute." He forgot to an
swer Bucks; they knew what it meant.
He was bracing himself to tell the folk
befora he left them. Preparing to . tell
the wifeâ and tha old manâ that he was
out. Out of .the railroad system he had
given his Ufa to help build up. Out of the
position he bad - climbed to by studying
like a hermit and working like a hobo.
Outâ without criticism, or allegation, or
reasonâ simply like a dog, out.
Callahan, with Bucks, tried to figure
what it meant.
Hailey nodded. The bridge foreman took
his pipe from his mouth and dashed it
into the stove. Hailey spoke. . - :
"I'm glad we're up to -high water at the
8plder, Bucks," said he at last. "When
they get it in the Peace River work, the
division will run for Itself for a year."
"Hailey," Bucks spoke slowly, "I don't
need to tell you what I think of it, do 17
It's a damned shame."
Halley rose to his feet. "Where you
going, Phil?" asked Bucks.
"Going back to the Spider on Number
Two."
"Not going back this morningâ why
don't you wait for Four, to-night," sug
gested Bucks.
"Who the hell Is he?" roared Ed. No
body answered: nobody knew. Bucks at
tempted to talk. Callahan lit bis lighted
pipe, but Ed Peeto stared at Halley like
a drunken man. , . . ..
"Did you hear that?" he snorted at his
superior.
Hailey nodded.
"You're out!" stormed Peeto.
" 'H. P. Agnew is appointed superin
tendent of bridges of the new 'division,
with headquarters at Omaha, vice P. -C.
Halley,' Bucks read on. Then he read
fast, looking 'for some further mention
of Halley. Halley promoted, transferred,
assignedâ but there was no further men
tion of Hailey. Bucks threw down the
order in a silence. Ed Peeto broke out
first.
"Who's H. P. Canoe?"
"Agnew."
"Well, well, well." said Halley, open
ing his eyes. "Here's promotions right
and left."
aloud for the benefit of 1 Callahan and
Halley and such hangers-on as Peeto and
an occasional stray dispatcher.
"Hello!" exclaimed Bucks; "here's a
general orderâ number fourteen "
The bovs drew their briers like one.'
Bucks read out a lot of stuff that didn't
touch our end, and then he reached this
paragraph:
" The Mountain and the Intermountain
divisions are hereby consolidated . under
the name of the Mountain division, with
J. F. Bucks as superintendent, headquar
ters at Medicine Bend. C. T. Callahan
is appointed assistant superintendent of
the new division.' '.' '. â¢
fellow, I guess, but we all bated him.
Bucks did the civil, though, and took
Agnew down to the Spider In & Â¦pedal to
Inspect the new work and Introduce him
to the man whose bread and opportunity
he was taking. There wasn't a mean drop
anywhere In Halley'o blood, and he mad*,
no trouble whatever for his' successor.
After he let go on the West End Halley
talked as if he would look up something
farther east, but Bucks told him frankly
he would find difficulty without a regular
degree. Hailey himself realized that.
Moreover, he seemed reluctant to quit tha
mountains. He acted around the cottage
and the Wickiup like a man who has lost
I something and who looks for It abstract
ly. But there -were lusty little Hailey s
over at the cottage to be looked after,
and Bucks, losing a roadm aster about
â¢ that time, asked Hailey (after. chewing It
- a lone time with . Callahan) to take the
place himself and stay op the staff., '
"I know. It doesn't seem Just right,"
Bucks put It, "but, Hailey, - you must re
member this thing at Omaha: Isn't going:
to last. They can't run a road like this
with Harvard graduates and Boston type
writers. There'll ba an entire new deal
down there some fine day. Stay here with
me, and I'll say this, Hailey, if I go

â¢ And Hftlley. sitting with his bead be
tween his hands, listening to hlÂ« wife and
to Buck*, said Â«ne day, "Enough," and
the first '; of ; the month reported for duty
as roadmaster.
Â¦Apieir, meantime, had stopped all con
struction work not. too far along to dis
continue. The bridge at the Spider for
tunately was beyond his mandate; It was
finished to a rivet as Halley had planned
it. Three spans, two piers and a pair of
abutments-solid as the Tetons. But the
Peace River canyon was caught to the air.
Halley's caissons gave way to piles 00
pulled the cost down from UOO.000 to J75.-
WO, and incidentally it was breathed that
the day" for extravagant expenditures on
the West End was past, and Bucks dipped
a bit deeper than usual Into Callahan s

no word. . â¢

Now came an April without any rise;
that April nothing roseâ except tha snow.
"We shall get it all together." suggested
Bucks one night
"Or will it get us altogether?" asked
Halley.
"Either way," said Callahan, "it win
be mostly at once."

We had no winter that year till spring,
and no spring till summer; and it was a
spring of snow and a summer of water.
Down below the plains were lost in snow
even after Easter. After that the snow
let up; it was then no longer a matter
of keeping the line dear; It was a mat
ter of lashing the track to the right of
way to keep it from swimming dear.
Hailey caught it worse than anybody, but
he worked like two men, for in a pinch
that was his way. Bucks leaned on tha
wiry roadmaster as he did on Callahan
or Neighbor. - Halley knew Bucks looked
to him for the track, and he strained
every nerve making ready for the time
tha mountain snows should go out.

moved into construction headquarters at
the Spider, and the first airlock ever
eunk west of the Missouri closed over
the beads of tall Hailey and big Ed Peeto.
The blowpipes never slept; night and day
the sand streamed from below, . and Hal
ley's caissons sank foot by foot toward
the rock. By the middle of September
the masonry was .crowding high-water
mark, and the following Saturday Halley
and Peeto ran trek to Medicine Bend to
rest "a a bit and ret acquainted with
their families. Halley looked ragged and
thin, like the old depot, but immensely
fesppy. ,
Sunday was a day to get your feet- on

Callahan's Cavendish. Bucks would open
the R. R. B. mafl and read the news
The new president, as befitted a very
blc man. received Halley with considera
ble dignity. He listened to the superin
tendent's statement of the necessities at
the Big Sandy River. The amount looked
littge. but the argument, supported by a
ruuss of statistics; was convincing.
Iiaikys budget called, too, for a new
bricst? at the Peace Riverâ and a good
one. Hailey Ftayt-d over to await the de
ctaion. He haunted the general offices un
til the president told him he could have
the money. The wire flashed the word to
the West End. Everybody at the Wick
iup was elad.
So there were many long conferences at
division headquarters between Bucks, su
perintendent, and Callahan, assistant, and
Hailey. superintendent of the bridges,
and afterward Hailey went once more to
general headquarters, lugging all his es
timates revised and all his plans refig
ured.
Halley would talk Spider bridge to a
Chinaman. His bridge foreman, Ed
Peeto, a staving 1 big one-eyed French
Canadian, actually had but two ideas in
lifeâ one was Hailey. the other the Spider
bridge. When the management changed
again, and a great and public-spirited
man took control of the eystem. Ed Pee
tro kicked his little water epanlel in a
frenzy of delight. "Now, Sport, old boy."
he exclaimed riotously, "we'll get' the
bridge."
But tha cost! The directors jumped
their table when they caw the figures. We
were being milked at that timeâ to put it
bluntly, being suckedâ by a Wall street
clique that robbed our good road, shaved
our salaries, impoverished our eq.ulpm.ent,
and cut our maintenance to the quick.
They talked economy and studied piracy.
When Halley demanded a thousand guild
ers for his Spider Water bridge they
laughed and said. "Come, take fifty." He
couldn't do anything tlse; and he built a
fifty-guilder bridge to bar the Spider's
crawL It lasted really better than the
average bridge.
But tha dream of Hat ley's lifeâ this we
all knew, and the Eloux would have sala
the Spider knewâ was to build a final
bridge over the Spider Waterâ a bridge it
throttle It for all time.

that was Hailey. All that Brodie knew
Hailey had from him; and where Brodie
Â«ras weak Hailey was strongâ master of
himself. When Brodie showed the image
he was made In. Hailey hid the shame
best he could, and Brodie, who hated even
himself, showed still a light In the wretk
by molding Hailey to his work. For one
day, eaid Brodie in his heart, this boy

say he wls Brodie's man. And better than
any of their Eastern graduates be shall
be. if he was made engineer by a drunk

tar than the graduates, better than Bro
dieâand to Halley came the time to
wrestle the Spider Water.
' All Brodie knew, all the Indians knew,
all that a life's experience, eating, living,
watching, sleeping with the big river had
taught him. that Halley knew. And when
Brodie's bridge went out Hailey was
ready with his new bridge. It was to be
such a bridge as Brodie's bridge with the
fire-water left out.

Peace.
Not a man in tha caboose was killed.
They scrambled, out of tha splinters and
on their feet, men and ready to do. Ona
voice from below came to them through
the storm, and they answered its calling.
It was Callahan. But Durden, Mullenix,
Peeto and Halley never called again.
At daybreak wreckers of the West End,
swarming from mountain and plain, wera
heading for the Peace, and the McCloud
gangâ upâ crossed tho Spider on Halley'a

men had. reported out. quaking as they
did* in the storm at the Spider foaming
over its approaches. But Hailey's , bridge
stoodâ stands to-day.
Yet three days the Spider raged, and
knew then its master, while he three
whole days sat at the bottom of the Peace
clutching the engine levers in the ruins
of Agnew*s mistake.
',' And, when -the divers got them up Cal
lahan and Bucks tore big, Peeto's arms
from his master's body and shut his star

And only the Spider ravening at Halley* s
caissons raged. But Halley slept.

"Coma on!" With tha words ha pushed
the conductor through the door and was

the caboose. Ahead of it Ed Peoto had

K-' eld, and Inside and outside looked
* much as It did In 15*0, when It was
built. Trampt liked it on account of the
roomy corridor, wnere they were permlt
tsd to lounge in the daytime, and because
tha prisoners cooked their own food. The
raw materials for the meals were passed
Into the Jail through a little window in
an Iron door, and the men took turns In
cooking. The cells were placed above the
corridor an4 at night the Sheriff came
and locked us In until morning. \V e
numbered, all told, nineteen men and
boys, sixteen of whom were court prison
ers who had etood their trials and were
waiting for their sentences. The remain-
Ing three. Including Ruderick McKlowd
and myself, had sbelr punishment meted
out to them by the wisdom of the local
magistrate and were serving it out then
and there.

At last the morning came when Justice
was to take off her bandage, and the
Sheriff told his wards that they must
hold themselves ready to go to the court
room at any moment. He was not sure
himself of the exact time when his Honor
would call for them, but he cautioned
them to be quick in responding to the call
when it came. Every one rushed to his
cell to get his clothes In . order. "Want
the old man to see me In my best," one
eaid, and the others followed him up to
the cell gallery and began to overhaul
their scanty supply of "togs." They dis
cussed tho merits at & patched waistcoat
"the old man" do? The first thing we
heard even before the Sheriff had let us
out for the day was the call from cell to
cell of the men to be sentenced that they
were twelve hours nearer tho appointed
time. Even during the night mutterlngs
reached Ruderick and me. from the men
who had been waiting longest. One night
we heard an old man of 70, who might
have been the grandfather of nearly all
of us, cry out in his sleep: "Make it a
year. Judge; Just an even year!" And he
threw into the words all the pleading and
pathos that he could have commanded
had he been awake.
He was a boy. of 18, called Eddie, who
had been convicted, in . company ' with
an older companion, of burglary./ y
"Kid,"" the mock Judge went on,;- "you'se
started out too fast. You'se too young, to'

Is possible that you need a little training'
to get Into the habit again, and ,1 ehall
send you over to the Sheriff for a 'month.'
If you behave yourselves you wlllVfind'
him an agreeable host." We behaved
ourselves, and found the Sheriff an agree
able host, but he took the most interest
In what he called the "transients"â the;
men whom Justice had weighed In her 1
balance and found wanting to a degree
which she had not yet taken off her ban-'
dage accurately to ascertain. They pre-'
eented a subject of speculation and mys-.
tery which we did not, and in return for
the Interest they gave him the Sheriff
offered them gruff little courtesies, which,
he hoped, would help somewhat to keep
their minds off their coming ordeaL Some
of them were culprits of long standing,
men who had taken their "stretchers," as
they called their terms in prison, regu
larly and without flinching, but none of
them knew what his next "str-tcher"
was to be. Some of them were lads sure
to go to the reform school, and all of
them, men and lads, were to retire from
the world for a certain periodâ but how
long? The limit that each of them could
get was well known, but no one believed
that he deserved or would get the limit.
Prisoners the world over feel that the
fact that they have been caught at all
Is a punishment, and Justifies them In
expecting a compromise with the Judge
who is to sentence them. If detection
itself Is a punishment, any further disci
pline ought to be measured according to
the- disappointment and chagrin which the
detection has caused. This is irrational,
but all men are irrational according to
their opportunities. It was the uncer
tainty as to bow far Justice, In the per
son of "the old man," would be willing to
compromise on this basis that kept the
men on a strain. Morning,. noon and
nifht the constant word- was: What will
or a frayed necktie as women d& the most
delicate finery. "How'd you think th* old
man'll like this?" a man called "Bony"
said, holding up a coat. Â¦ v .,' â¢
."Get it sterilized. Bony; it's full of
Exaybacks. De old man'll give you de
limit if they get to' paradln' around de
courtroom," another remarked, not un
truthfully.
j"How*d youse think this white rag'll
take?" queried still another, dubbed "Jet
Eyes," exhibiting a "boiled" shirt which
he had kept under his pillow for weeks
for fear it would be "swiped!" .' ./-Vj
"Keep it to swing in, Sammy," advised
his cellmate. "It's too good Jus* to get
two years in. Put It in a safety vault till
croakin' time comes."
"In an hour they had all put on their
best, and a dress rehearsal in the corridor
was in order. One of the oldest prisoners
was appointed Judge, and the men lined
up in front of him. This was play, and
in a measure comedy, but not. wholly, so.
The culprits expected to catch from the
mock judge and the mock sentence some
omen of what their fate was to be. The
judge carried off his part with Impressive
dignity and severe eyebrow. . He had bor
rowed a clean collar and a sky-blue neck
tie for the occasion; he had absolutely
refused to officiate except in costume. >T.ie
men practiced attitude and gestures,
which- they expected to use Â¦ with effect
later in the day.
"Hungry," he said in a voice which .was
proper to the majesty of the law, to the
man at the head of the line, ."you .was
caught in de act, wasn't you? Now, that
means bunglln'. Blokes what knows their
business don't get pinched in de act. But

home. I told him to write to his govj nor.
an' get .the thing fixed up. ; I can' tell |

"Don't send me to the Ref, yer Honor;
I bin to the Ref, an' it's nolhin' but a
kids' joint. I can't learn NOTH1N'
there. "
He went through the line of men and
boys, sometimes the scene being comical
and sometimes pathetic. The rehearsal
finished, the crowd broke up into little
groups. Some of them gathered around
the table; others took their stand near,
the iron door. Impatient for- the Sheriff
to call them. Ruderick and I took seats
on a bench in one of the corners, andthe
boy Eddie and his pal strolled up and
down the corridor. His pal urged him to
take ad va ntage of his boyish appearance
and try to get a'reform school sentence.
"You^can run away after you'se been
there awhile," the man said, "an' then
you'se free. See?" .
"Damn" the ref," ; the- lad replied. "I'm
goin' to. the pen." .''Â¦..
"Know.vthat kind o'iiid?"' Ruderick
auKed, nodding in the direction of the two
when they had passed out of earshot. "I
can tead his -future for. you. Did I ever

much of a story to toll at the time; p'r'aps
that was why he wouldn't tell it! "I, found

There was a pause . in Ruderick's
narrative, and 'the bolts of the iron door
of a place "quite another than heaven were
shot back to' remind us how .far from
heaven we were. Every one thought Jhat
the Judge hid ; sent for the men to be
sentenced, but it was a false alarm. The
tiirnkev had a letter. to deliver to one of
the .court prisoners, and we separated into
groups again, and ; Ruderick knotted . the
broken thread of his ; Y?r.ilnIscences. .

Riding in the car. ; one .would never
dream that they were other than the
ordinary walking .boots showing under a
short skirt ; unless I the ; soles were tipped
up, and as there is no occasion for that,
the ! enthusiast : can "don her regalia and

n for the athletic womanl
I \ Her victory over the shopman has
I I been won, and, what ls more "to
~7 the point, won with a vengeance.
In this age and generation she can
go about equipped as she likes best and
not a* torn* clerk behind a counter ad
vises. For she has boots, all kinds of
boots, and more than ' she could have
fancied In her wildest moments.
French heels are pretty and there ls no
use denying It. When a dainty, chic girl
crosses the street with a lot of pretty,
fluff -fluffs the tiny high heel adds a grace
that nothing else can and all the learned
men from now until the crack of doom
can prate and preach on the bad effects '
that Invariably result from their use, but*
used they will be Just the same and the
doctors had far better save their breath.
But French heels are not always the
proper caper. In fact, there arÂ« hosts of
times when they are a perfect ~abominiÂ£j.
tion and more to be avoided than the most
deadly plague. The trim, little trotter that '.
gives any girl such a Jaunty appearance is
positively ruined when .worn with ,- any
but the military or the low, flat heel, and
as society will not tolerate what is termed
as "a flat foot," or more commonly known
as a broken-down arch, there isn't very
much choice left.
The woman who thinks It her bounden
duty to rush to the country, to keep away
nervous prostration, or aa It has come to
be called "Americanltis,';' had I > better
look a little nearer home, for. the reason
of her feet. But If she does deem It es- .
sentlal to her happiness - she can take
along an array of shoes and boots that
will b* ! a constant source of delight to
her. .
There really Isn't any wonder that the i
woman who wears a shoe Just because "it
ls swell" ls* tired y and cross and every- '[
thlngthat Is bad to have about v Etvery
step she takes Is just that much toward
a violent headache that Is bound to come
during the course I of ' the day, for every '
movÂ© Jars her entire body from the tip *
of her head to her toes, and after a series
of shock* her brain refuses to work prop
erly and she goes to bed In self-defense.
"The athletlo girl Is the one that is best
fitted out and every, time she 'puts . her '
foot' do wn to the ground you may depend
upon It that she ' takes solid ' comfort, yet
at the same time she has been ' clever
enough*; to combine smartness " with ease

i the fact ; that she 1* â¢ clad faultlessly from
the ground up. ' â¢Â¦, '
ThÂ« >ery swslleÂ«t and the Very, newest
things in the line of footwear ls what ls
termed the automobile boots. And what
beauties,', theyj are, 'tool ? In the first place^
they are made of a leather that is never
employed in any other shoe, unless it -be*
; the riding boot. A soft, verrety skin, that
looks much like undressed kid, and in a
. way like* fur, for It changes color and
shades from light to dark, according to
the way; It' i*j rubbed.-'.
The sole itself is of msdram weight and

and broad in order . to make a firm toot-*
Ing or to catch in the stirrup, for the two
makes of boots are as much alike as two
peas from the same pod. ;Â¦â¢
Just over the instep is where the rub
comes "and what really . characterizes the
': make ' of ' a'; good ; ; shoe. : .When the boot
' is drawn on ? It â¢ looks ' large and one ls
; apt to say: -.'1 can swim ; ; In this," but

about and Tand her fish as well as tho
most, expert fisherman, provided, of
course, that she has mastered the art of
knowing when she has a "bite," but, as
a rule, unless she has gone Into the sport
pretty thoroughly she would never dreamt
of wasting her money for such an unat
tractive costume.' but rather invest in a
host of bewildering frills and furbelows.
Taken all together, even among tho
athletic women, there are scarcely a hun
dred among a thousand feet that are ever
shod in a way that la sensible and yet
stylish at the same time. The girl* who
delights in the high heel gets them higher
and higher until she Is walking about on
stilts at least three or four Inches high
and sometimes even as many as five,
and the girl who boasts that she Is pos
sessed with common sense gets them
lower and lower until she has reached the
other, extreme.- .
. Every woman wishes pretty feet and
very few, possess them.* ; And it isn't be
cause they pass -over their footwear with
little or no consideration or because they
grudge the money spent ' in: that fashion,
but * It â¢ ls ; simply bÂ«caus* i Mme. Fashion

"I didn't." protested Miss Mlnta, look
ing Inclined to fly for her life. "There
was a great spider on the ball, and In try-
Ing to shake It away and fling it Into the
yard. I accidentally tossed the yarn too "
"It was providential,", aaid the doctor
stealing an unabashed arm about Miss
Mlnta, â¢for the clew led me straight to
paradise.**
â¢Thenâ 0ayb* It was fate, after alL"
The doctor stepped Joyously forward
Miss Aminta turned primly aside.
"Since" you think the role of clergy
man's wife my only fitting oneâ"
"But I don't." cried the doctor, "some
body's been lying like Ananiaa. I thinkâ"
The gleam of light from the door sud
denly widened and a hilarious young mob
rushed out shouting lawlessly.
"Goody, goody." shrieked Mlnta May
.-Aunt Mlnta threw a ball of yarn and
Dr. Ixtveland has found It."
Amlnta's forehead took on a mystified
frown. "I know nothing about any min
ister's slippers; and I should scarcely
think. of knitting them out of crimson
vrorsted If I did. Poor brother Tom suf
fers from rheumatism and wants some
krttted wristlets-" .
"I thought at first It might be fate and
that she was going to be kind," he said
"but I recognlxe the skein of red wool!
andâ of course the minister must have his

Dr. Lorelaod, out on a foot expedition
and caught by the autumn nightfall, had
not taken a short cut through Miss Ap
pleton's V ack premises, the akeln of ro
znance so skillfully tangled by Mrs. Lynd
might have remained tangled indefinitely.
However, the doctor did take the short
cut, and treading gingerly through the
late, crisp grass he stepped upon some
round object that gave pliantly under the
pressure of his foot. A slender, long glim
mer of light came from Miss Aminta's
kitchen and fell upon a Blight crimson
line running to the, door, which arose,
taut, as the doctor lifted the object from
the- groundâ a ball of red zephyr wool
Walking deliberately to the house he
wound the strand of thread as he went
Â«p the etep and onto the porch, where
Miss Aminta stood, a startled look on her
face, which was pale in that yellow light
end four ehining knitting needles In her
hand, from which ran the crimson thread.
The doctor stepped suddenly back, his
face glooming.
Miss Arainta promised to surrender her
premises to the youthful besiegers, and

people are born stars, some achieve the
lofty eminence, and some have stardom
thrust upon them; you were born a star,
I but you really can't act a little bit."

but instead of lacing to the top and end

have what is called an "Improved cuff,"

about the top of the boot and buckle
snugly on the side. VI

After'a dance,. ten to one. the first pe
riod has to be cut because there Isn't
time to prepare the subject, and it's
mighty easy and ever so much nicer to
saunter off on the hills and rest and jab
ber the mornings away. It's a vast im
provement on Chemistry, and is warrant
ed to drive the blue devils and headache
away.
People are always tremendously Inter,
ested In the doings of young people and
there is such a rattling fine opportunity
at a dance to watch unseen, and don't
forget. Miss Lady, that the chaperons
who sit and gossip are responsible for a
generous half of what Is said about your
foolishness.
lessly dropped hint, a partial suggestion
to others or a wistful longing and the
thing is yours to do with, as you please.
It's positively stupid for any girl to
dance six or seven, times .with one chap,
no matter how ;much she might fancy
him, and if they can't do better than that
they had far better stay at home and
shoo the rest of the family Into the back
of the house and then .sit and make
sheep's eyes at each , other where, at
least, ottfers can't have the fun of watch
ing them.
If by any chance this should not do. try
the green-soap method, which rareiy, if
ever, fails. Green soap can be purchased
at ary tirug shop, and, by the way, ft
is not grejen. Indeed, it is about the
color of custard. Bathe the face in hot
water, wringing cloths In hot water and
applying them to the face for about fif
teen minutes. Anoint the face with the
soap, rubbing it well into the pore3 for
about five or six minutes. Rinse the eoap
from the face with more hot water, using
a camel's hair brush in order to remove
all the soap and as many of the black
heads as will come. Dry the face and
anoint with a skin food or cream.- Con
tinue this treatment every night until the
blackheads have disappeared. Either one
of these treatments may sound long and
you may think them irksome, but bear in
mind that this need be kept up only until
they have vanished, when ordinary soap
and water with a good brush and an oc
casional application of green s6ap will
keep your face smooth and clean, for
"Cannenclta"â Obviously there Is but
one way to get rid of blackheads and
that Is by forcing them out of the
clogged pores. Certainly, they cannot be
drawn back whence they came, but in
pressing them out you should be more
than careful tb see that your skin is
properly softened, for an enlargement of
the pores immediately fills up again and
becomes more malignant.
For two or three weeks, until the skin
is thoroughly softened, apply a skin fcod.
If you are not quite certain about a pood
one. I will give you a receipt gladly.
Hake this application at night, after
washing the .face with a pure boap and
hot water. Be sure to rinse the soap out
of the face and dry the skin well before
applying the cream. At the end of such
time your skin should be soft and clean
and a moderate pressure will eject them
readily.
After all is said and done what is a col
lege, anyhow? Nothing more nor lesa
than an overgrown grammar school,
where people, are trained to be useful,
competent and happier In their everyday
life, but trained, nevertheless, as the lec
ture lassie knows full well, that a snug
apartment for two 13 worth an the
bachelor's quarters going; or for that
matter, all the colleges in the world
bunched together, and when it comes
right down to it, a course in metaphysics
really Isn't necessary, although it un
questionably Is inspiring.
And on the other hand, the college girl
may ngt nave been the happiest girl in
her class or tCe most popular one at a
dance, but when It comes down to a mat
ter of life the trained, disciplined mind is
hers and - she goes about the business of
housekeeping as though life held nothing
mor- fascinating for her. And it really
don ., for her practicability has shown hÂ«r
that she may become the Joy of svery
one within the reach of her well kept
home,
School teachers are rarely. If ever, good
housewives, but the college girl has a
practical side to her education and it
has not been blunted by years of routine
work, and besides, as a rule, she is gen
erally well grounded in 0<rhat leads to
health, wealth and-, happiness, or in
plainer words, the culinary department.
You can talk abqut your colleges with
a great, big C and your women with a
great, big W and chatter about the tre
mendous advance in art. science and all
educational reforms, but the fact re
mains Just the same that a woman la
judgfd by her capabilities as a home
maker, and the happiest one on earth Is
she who finds the most congenial work
within her own walls and with her family.
College men are very human and the
brightest men love and marry the girl
who flutters about at pink teas and who
spends the greater part of her time select
ing becoming hats and elaborate what
nots. They want recreation and a rest
and find it in the idle chatter of these
china dolls. â¢
Once in an age you may find a girl who
is genuinely interested in her work and
she is quite another story.
She appreciates the value of time and
when a chap says he has some work to
do trots serenely on her way. and what
Is more to the point, she isn't hurt or
angry either.
Can't you fairly see the girl who always
asks the Impossible and plays the part of
the temptress? She comes tripping daint
ily along with a brilliant idea In her head
and begs you to "Come on. and cut your
work." "But what excuse could I offer?"
"Oh." with an airy wave of the hand,
"say you forgot."
Now fancy a girl with a grain of sensa
actually sitting up and gravely asking
any man to proffer such an excuse. Yet
she docs It all the time and never gives
it a second thought.
But this woman of broad culture knowÂ»
better, for she has been trained In thÂ«
beauty of order, the grace of simplicity,
the value of system In all undertakings
and the wisdom of doing well in all
things, no matter how trifling they
may be.

ETIQUETTE OF THE
COLLEGE GIRLLike a bird with brilliant neck plumage
the fashionable woman looks. Her neck
is encircled with a ruffle of some gay
color, while her gown may be ever so
subdued. The neck ruffles are made up in
scarlet, in blue, In green, in white and In
the tender shades of violet and the soft
tones of yellow. One can hardly get too
gay a ruffle, nor can the style or the ma
terial or the manner of making be too
extreme. Even women of conservative
tastes are wearing the bright colors
around the neck and there are collarettes
that are a mass of fancy coloring.
One thing counted with another, the
taste runs Into brown, and brown is used
in "every material. There are the soft
browns and the heavy browns and there
are browns that run off Into the reds.
Brown is by far the best color of the
year and everything is made In brown
from gowns and shoes to neck ruffles,
umbrellas and hats.
The brown rough goods make up in the
most charming way. There are very
rough zlbellnes with a brown background
and large white spots, and there are
brown camel's hair goods, which are just
the thing to trim with red.
The brown rough goods can be very
becomingly piped with red satin and with
red cloth. And the heavier the goods the
more the vogue for trimming them with
the softer materials of silk and satin.
' One altogether lovely piece of brown
goods, with a long, soft, silky surface, so
ruffles and many shirrings of silk and Is
adorned at the back of the neck with a
Very large chou of ribbon.
Another cape for evening wear Is fash
ioned of silk, and is trimmed with little
ruchlnga of cashmere arranged In rows
along the bottom of the cape.
Still another cape is made of very heavy
grade of peau de sole and is decorated
along the edge with ruffles of silk, while
the remainder of the cape is a mass of
embroidery. This cape is exceedingly
pretty for wearing to card parties and
small, evening affairs where one can wrap
a' scarf around one's head to match the
cape. .. .
The Picture Collarette. Â»
It Is scarcely to be expected that any
ityle could come in this season without
*lts picture-qualities, and the capes are no
exception to the rule that all dress must
be picturesque. There are many of the
cape family .that are more than picture
like, having qualities of decoration that
are positively romantic. Â¦ .
. , Witness a collarette built of black
patln embroidered In red and gold silk,
the'aeslgn being Russian. Trees, strange
animals and all sorts of quaintly shaped
houses are worked into the design of the
collarette, which Is , only shoulder deep
and is Intended- for evening /wear alone.
Along its edges there are ! shirrlngs of
white moussellne.
Another. little cape for evening;wear is
a white satin, embroidered , In gold
The second was made of moussellne
with a very heavy little- niching laid on
along the edges, the niching being of
silk.
ThÂ© third was a very pretty thing In
shirred panne velvet lined with taffeta.
The shirrings were trimmed with narrow
rows of ribbon trimmed with an embroid
ery stitch. And the ends were decorated
with a heavy silk fringe.
All Kinds of Neck Ruffles.
The French modistes this year are say-
Ing to their patrons: "Wear anything at
all so long as you have a becoming little
neck cape." And the patrons are taking
their advice. .They are literally wearing
anything and are throwing over the
shoulders a neck ruffle to dress It up.
Old clothes, summer clothes, faded
clothes, any clothes at all, are worn; and
around the neck is cast the saving arti
cle of dress â the neck cape.
One of the neck capes recently made is
a stunning example of what can be done
with a little- chiffon and a little silk. The
shape of the article is that of a cape cut
in three-quarter length and rather scant.
It is made of taffeta. But^ over the taffeta
there is placed a covering or knife plaited
chiffon which Is finished with a very deep
double ruffle of chiffon. There are two
wide chirrings, of chiffon which trim the
lower edge of the cape. The whole is bor
dered with the same kind of trimming. A
large bunch of roses finishes the back of

to keep the cape around the shoulders.
A shoulder cape. Intended for evening
wear, though not heavy enough for opera
wear with a low necked gown, is made of
cashmere. It is cut In circular fashion,
but is Intended to be worn open In â¢ the
front, falling from the shoulders like a
Hamlet cape. It is trimmed with many

sometimes without slot seams. They are

These suits are built of instep length.
In -fact the most novel of the season's
fashions is the new Instep skirt, which
is as long as its name suggests and which
Is cut off even all the way around. It is
a skirt that is finished with a hem around
the bottom; it is strapped as to the seams
all the way up; it is trimmed with strap
pings of cloth a foot deep around the bot
tom and each strapping Is finished with
a cloth button.
This skirt !Â» tightly fitted around the
hips; It Is fitted, too, around the figure:
It is fitted even around the knees and
the only fullness comes around the fnstep.
where the skirt flares a very little. The
instep skirt Is as a rule unlined and. be
ing made of fairly heavy cloth, it needs
no lining, for Its own weight is sufficient,
and. owing to- the nature of its cut. It
requires no stiffening underneath.
In England, where they call this suit
a trotting suit, it Is worn unlined and
without a long petticoat. But in this
country and In Paris, where women are
wedded to long skirts, a long petticoat is
worn as a rule. The American woman,
like her French cousin, requires a little
fluff around her feet, a little fullness, a
frou-frou, which can be obtained in no
way except from the. silk petticoat.
The coat of the trotting suit is a three
quarter coat, very snug In the back, with
something of the straight front to con
form to the lines required by fashion.
It, too, is stitched and strapped, and its
lapels are mannish to a degree, even
showing the peculiar stitched button hole
affected by imn. The collar turns over
and is stitched and the lapels lie flat upon
the coat.
The sleeves of this coat are of the mas
culine persuasion, with the very slightest
degree of fullness at the shoulder, but not
enough to be called puff. They are long,
to- the knuckle, and they arc trimmed
with three very neat little cloth buttons.
In fact, a tailor, If he were making the
coat for man's wear, could hardly make
It more mannish in its appearance.
But around the neck cf this severely
tailored coat there is thrown a fluffy doh,
so that woman after all, no matter how
mannish she may decide to be, is willing
to make a concession to her femininity.

popularity. One. all width and no langth,

other, with It? stole ends and the trailing

Is meant for the woman who is tall. If
there are ail Miles of women it is true
that there are a!i styles of boas.
A new style from Paris chows a boa
which is made entirdy of knife-plaited
taffeta. The silk is laid in little eide plaits
which run thÂ«= full length of the neck ruf
fle. The stole fronts are long and almost
touch the hem of the dress. The entire
edge is bordered with down to make a
very s^ft, white, fluffy finish.
The flower boa, too. is a French feature,
one that ha* bÂ« en carried over from sum
mer and intensified for winter. This neck
Ceooratlon is now seen, ail a mass of
American Pcauty roses, with the stoles
consisting of l<ng-stemmed roses hanging
bead downward by their stems.

all tv.lPted ar.l hanging this way and

of the valley boa, which is a soft, white,
delicate thing. Intended for debutantes,
and made y.irtiy of chiffon and partly of
fllk t'.<pue and partly of gwansdown,
with the lilies peeping out upon their
Blendr-r etems here and there.
If there Is a woman of artistic tastes,
and a little cluCon and some artificial
roses, an excell?nt neck ruffle can be
fashioned in a very few minutes. The
chiffon can be shirred upon a foundation
or It can be sun-plaited or It can be laid
In tiny ruffles upon a backing of crino
line. The flower's, if they are in good
condition, ean be wwed in little rows
upon the nr-ck ruffle or they can be
strung along its length from end to end.
But if they are fa'Jed and poor they
should be ironed as smartly as possible
and massed at the throat and on the
ends.
A Riernir.K lc?son might be given upon
the freshening of artificial flowers. Roses
of all color*, pinks and even lilies and
geraiiuni.s can be made to look like new.
The petals can be dampened and pressed
with a tiny Iron. And then, with a
brush dipped in water color paints, the
colors can be restored. A little dry rouge
la very good for the tinting of rose petals.

Up Fifth Avenue.
Up Fifth avenue the other day there
came three girls chatting gajiy. All wore
neck ruffles, neck capes or collarettes,
and all were dressed In pretty cloth suits
of autumn with the neck arrangements
thrown around the shoulders merely as
an accessory, not as a necessary article
of dress.
One wore a feather boa, made flat in
abape and sewed upon a foundation of
cloth cut like a cape. The feathers bor
dered each edge and the cape made a
very' comfortable little article of dress.
Another wore the conventional feather
boa. but it was made very flat and there
were three or four varieties of feathers
In Its length. All were of one color; a
very soft brown, and at the throat the
fastening consisted of a very â¢wide piece
of ribbon, tied into many little bows like
a ribbon chou.
The third wore the conventional flat
feather boa, nearly a quarter of a yard
wide and extending over the shoulders
and hanging down the front almost to
the street, where it terminated In many
little fur bulls made up like a fur fringe.
As there three young women went up
Fifth evenue, three others came down
and passed them, all wearing the little
collarettes, or boas, and 'again all three
were different.
One was made of Bilk, cut In circular
eboulrier shape, with a border of fur on
each edge. At the throat there was a
dafp. There weie no stolen ends, but
the whole was shaped and finished like
a yoke collar. .

THE
WINTER
BADIn several critical instances this has had the effect of restoring harmony.
The old practice in Irish officialdom was for the representatives of Eng
lish power to surround themselves only with the "truly loyal," chiefly func
tionaries who fattened on the salaries and spoils of office. The viceregal
lodge, Dublin Castle, and the houss of the "400" generally shut their gates
against any one who dared to question English policy toward Ireland- The
"landlord garrison" was courted, feted and rewarded, while the Irish Na
tionalist was given the "glassy eye" and threatened with the penalties of co
ercion acts if he did not move with "bated breath and whispering humble
ness."

are of much interest. . . . , Â¦.Â¦':' '..â¢'.' .. , . Â¦ -
Without going into tiresome details and giving too many statistics it may be stated that the character of
crime differs with races and nationalities. Apparently murder and assault seem to be the prevalent sins of the colored
convict population in the South, while the Chinese and Mexicans have a weakness for murder When the parents of
the American-born convicts are given a large per cent of them arc foreign-born, due undoubtedly to the fact
that under the new conditions prevailing in this country the foreign parent finds it difficult to -bring up a child mor
ally as well as can be done at home. ; - \ ,â¢*?â¢ . , t t
Â¦ So far as criminal statistics prove anything, "the honest farmer' is a delusion and a snare, as a lar*e number of
criminals are credited to that occupation. Laborers form, by all odds, the vast majority of the criminals. No doubt,
however the occupation is due to the criminal tendency and not the criminal tendency to the occupation, as it is be
cause these men are too lazy or incompetent to be mechanics or professional men that they are classed as labor
ers Some particular occupation, varying according to the locality, seems to be very prolific of criminals. Thus
nearly 12 per cent of the convicts in the Missouri penitentiary are shoemakers, while railroad men are' conspicuous
in Minnesota and chairmakers in Kentucky, and painters and carpenters have the largest representation among
those engaged in the building trades. .
It is also a notable fact that the number of prisoners is much greater south of Mason and Dixon s line than
north of it and in the Wcst.as compared with the East. So far as the South is concerned illiteracy and the nccro
ooDulation'seem.to have a great deal to do with the large criminal population. Thus in Georgia there were 2.Â«i
nrisoners on the 1st of last October, while in Michigan, with a population 200.000 greater, there were only uo.?.
Texas has nearly as large a criminal population as New York, although the population of New York is twice that ot
Texas Pennsylvania reports only 1768 convicts, with a population of 6.000.000, while Cahlorma. with less than a mil
lion and a half has 2241. and Kansas, with practically the same population as this State, only 1025, yet the adioinms
State of Missouri has 2070. New Hampshire has 157 convicts to 300 in Oregon, although their population is about
the same Large as are the figures for the South, it would appear from some of the reports that they should be even
larzer since able-bodied neeroes are sentenced in that section to the county jails instead of to the State peniten
tiary so that their labor can be utilized on the county roads. Undoubtedly the higher percentage of crime in the
West as compared with the East is, du e to the fact that in the West there are pore single men. less home life and a
more unsettled condition of society. Robbery in its various forms is the principal offense committed in the Western
States The percentage of murders is also quite large, but outrages and similar crimes are less common than in the
South One fact however, stands out conspicuously in all parts of the countryâ if we would decrease our criminal
oooulation we must increase our educational facilities. We should insist upon compulsory education in every State
in the Union of every child, regardless of race or color, capable of completing a grammar school course, and we
should insist 'upon their completing such a course before they are allowed to work or quit school

in the way he thould go and when he is old he will not depart from it."
The great trouble is that too many parents act as if they thought the injunction read, "Tell a child how he
should go This is the easiest possible thing for a oarent to do; yet telling a hundred times may onlv end in dis
appointment. Other parents seem to think they should merely "teach the child how he should go." While this is a
step in the right direction, it will not answer. It is not sufficient to explain the way, for the child may not be dis
posed to travel the way indicated. Again, others seem to think that it means "manage the child so he will start in
the way he should go.',' Even this is not sufficient, for he is almost certain to stray from the right way into the by
wty. It is not sufficient to tell the child, nor even to teach the child, nor even to manage the child. Nothing will be
sufficient except a compliance with the injunction to "train up a child." Training may imply telling, teaching and
managing; but it also means seeing that the child goes in the right way. until going right becomes a habit, a second
nature. This . ii no small undertaking. This is hard work.
To all outward appearances many parents seem to care but little for the welfare of their children. Few parents
are just what. they feel they should be as examples for their children, and it is very unpleasant to see their own
faults repeated in their children. Nearly all would have it otherwise. If the truth be known, it would be seen that
almost all would gladly do the right thing, but are ignorant as to just what should be done. Not knowing what is
best the only thing they can do is to act as seems best at the time.
' With but few exceptions parents are intensely interested in the welfare of their children. Their mistakes are
error* of judgment rather than of heart They are the results of ignorance as to the best method of managing the in
dividual child.' It may not be pleasant to acknowledge this fact, but it is none the less true. Nor are parents to be
blamed. Where have they been able to find anything suggestive upon these subjects? No matter how earnestly thev
may have desired light, it was not to be had for the seeking. It is hoped that excellent books upon this subiect of
the training of children may multiply, so that earnest parents may have no trouble in learning the ideas of those who
have given much thought to this all-important problem.
In mental, physical and moral characteristics children are almost entirely the result of two factors. First,
that which they inherit from their parents; second, the training which they receive from their parents and' others.
While accepting the responsibility for the first, too many parents aredisposed to attempt to throw the responsibility
for the second upon the school, the church and the community. Since the parents largely determine not only the
school but also the society and the church under whose influence the child must come, the responsibility is entirely
their own. It is the parents* business to see to it that the child is under proper influences, not only while at home,
but si so when away from home. Heaven has placed this" responsibility upon parents. '
It will be readily seen, therf. that as the children have the parents' disposition, as well as their precept and ex
ample, which are too often antagonistic, there need be no wonder why the chips- do not fall far from the block. If
the chips are not of the sound, sterling oak, parents should examine closely and be sure before criticizing the chips,
that they do not come from a decayed specimen of soft wood.
Mosyyarents have made many grievous mistakes in the management of their children, but, even yet. it may
not be tooWate to save the precious child. The demand with which every parent must comply is, "Train up a child

V(* ~j*v\f!>\|l a co in Dublin, resolutions of thanks were passed to Chief
'''\K~i;%irb : ' Secretary George Wyndham for his great services in
Vr/^^V?** ! "aking the new land bill the law of the land.
r t-e/ ''^SBfik? I Such an acknowledgment of appreciation and grati-
I '-ife^Si^, 1 tude from a body of avowed Nationalists is unprecc
- dented in the history' of Ireland. The Chief Secretary
well deserves it. and next to him thanks are due to his as
f r:,t : or permanent "Under Secretary." Sir Anthony O'Donnell. who is
. credited with bavin jr drawn uo the bill and worked indefatitrablv for its
passage. The new land act took effect on November 1. and lone before
that nrcessary steps were taken for the transfer of great estates all over Ire
land from the owners to their tenants. What was accomplished in France
a little marc than a centurv aco bv means of a bloody revolution will soon
Uc done in Ireland by peaceful, legal means, proving that "peace hath her
victories no less than war." In order to affect this transformation the Brit
ish Government pledges its credit for from $500,000,000 to $750,000,000. and
makes a bonus, or free gift, to the landlords of $60,000,000. which comes
out of the pockets of the taxoavers of the United Kingdom.
George Wyndham had a Herculean task before him when he undertook
to pass this land bill. Gladstone, or any of the Liberal leaders, would not
have dared to venture it because they realized that even if successful in the
House of Commons thev would be overwhelmingly defeated in the House
cf Lords. The Upper House has always been the graveyard of measures
framed to ameliorate the condition of Ireland. Wyndham. in the first place,
had hard work to convince a maioritv of the British Cabinet that his bill
would settle forever the never-ending, vexatious land war and brine peace
and cpntent to Ireland. Colonial Secretary Chambeflain was bitterly op*
posed to the measure, because there is no love lost between him and the dis
ciples of Parne!I. as manv rancorous debates in Parliament bear witness.
The Duke of Devonshire was also ooposed because he cannot forect that
one of his house. Lord Frederick Cavendish, was assassinated in Phoenix
Park.
Wyndham had to encounter opposition sufficient to daunt any ordinary
man in passing the bill through both houses of Parliament. By his success
lie has made a name for himse'f among the great statesmen of the day. In
the recent reconstruction of the British Cabinet he could have had almost any
place he desired, but he preferred to stay at his post of Chief Secretary for
Ireland until he had completed his work. He promised the Irish members
to introduce at the next session of Parliament a bill for the amelioration
of the condition of Irish farm laborers. If the Balfour administration can
Veep together long enough he will no doubt meet with the same success he
<l'u\ with the land bill.
Mr. Wyndham shares his popularity in Ireland with the Lord Licuten-
Rrt. Earl Dudley, and the Under Secretary. Sir Anthony O'Donnell. Lord
! >u.lley has not a seat in the Cabinet, but Wyndham has. and is therefore
virtually at the head of the Irish administration. The Irish Secretary is a
Tttnarkably handsome man. young (not yet 40). tall; slight, with well cut
?e tnres. to which long lashes give an air of gentleness. His dark hair is
now slightly silvered with premature gray. .His whole bearing is sympa
thetically courteous, and he has the knack of ingratiating himself with the

M.yor of Dublin. In dealine with them he does not forget the motto placed

Where he canrot comply he gives his reasons, man to" man, for refusal, and
THE SUNDAY CALL.
To-day the practice is somewhat different. The Lord Lieutenant and hU
Chief Secretary and Under Secretary no longer frown upon or stand aloof
from the masses. Prominent Nationalists, some of whom had to suffer the
plank bed and bread-and-water diet in prison for loving: their country "not
wisely, but too well." can occasionally be seen in earnest conversation with
those high officials. It is said of Sir Anthony O'Donnell when he waited
upon Kin* Edward at the time of his appointment as Under Secretary he in
formed his Majesty that he was not only a Roman Catholic but a!so an
Irish Nationalist The King replied that "it did not matter." All he wishes
was that "his administration should be as successful as when he held a
similar post in India." The Chief Secretary, though an aristocrat by birth
and environment, is one of the most accessible of officials.
George Wyndham married the widow of the late Earl Grosvenor. She
haÂ« a son who is now the Duke of Westminster and is probably the richest
peer in Great Britain. Wyndham started life as a .soldier. He was an of
ficer in the Coldstream Guards and served with honor in the Suakim cam
paign against the Dervishes in Africa. His advent in politics was as private
secretary to Arthur Balfour, the present Prime Minister of England. . His
rise and progress as a statesman have been rapid, and to-day he is recog
nized as the most powerful force in the Cabinet since the retirement of the
late Colonial Secretary. Joseph Chamberlain. His administration of affairs
in Ireland has not been perfunctory or with an eye to personal ambition.
In the House of Commons, in the councils of his party, on the hustings
and in public assemblies, he has again and again declared his sympathies with
the wants and desires of the ereat majority of the Irish people. Why should
this not be so? George Wyndham is a great-grandson of Lord Edward
Fitzgerald, son of the first Duke of Leinster, who sacrificed his life for the
Irish cause in the memorable year 1798- Lord Edward married, in Paris,
the famous Pamela, daughter of the Duke of Orleans. They had but one
child, a daughter, who married General Sir Guy Campbell, and their daugh
ter, Madeline, is the mother of George Wyndham, the present Chief Secre
tary for Ireland.
The career of Lord Edward Fitzgerald is most pathetic and his end very
sad indeed. "What a noble fellow." said Lord Byron, "was Lord Edwanl
Fitzgerald." Now comes the remarkable coincidence that what was one cf
Lord Edward's visions, as a result of revolution like that of the French
Revolution, has actually been brought about, mainly through the instrumen
tality of his great-grandsonâ the overthrow of the effete, feudal system of
landlordism and the substitution of a peasant proprietorship. Remarkable
also is the fact that foremost among the great land-owners in Ireland to
come to terms with his tenants under the Wyndham act for the sale to them
of his vast estates is the young Duke of Leinster. the blood relation of
Lord Edward Fitzgerald. His example is beinar followed all over Ireland,
and there is every prospect that the Wyndham land bill will produce
nearly all the results claimed by its advocates. If so. some future great
chronicler will echo the words of Byron. "What a noble fellow wasâ George
Wyndham.!'

When the novel "Robert Elsmere "
was first published it was the topic oj
tea table conversation In New England
ad nauseam. Mr. Balfne told of a neigh
bor who had a eilver collar duly engraved
and placed on the neck of his large good
catured house dog. When a visitor ex
amined the inscription he read: "Please
do not mention the name of Robert Els
mere Jn the hearing of this dog. H e will
not stand everything."
"Her lover!" That was what her. heart
cried out, and though she would not per
mit herself to say it there was a wild,
sweet bliss in the thought. Subtly she had
known it almost from the first. But a
widower!
She shivered now at the very remem
brance of things that had once thrilled
herâ the unconscious softening of the
keen eyes when they met hers, the elusive
but unmistakable tenderness of his touch
when he helped her over a rough place
or held her wrap. Time was when the
caress of his glance made her blood tin
gle. Now she remembered It with a sort
of loathing. Had his eyes not softened
for some other woman?
Thus she wrestled wuÂ»Â» love and pain
"It can't be trusâ it can't beâ it can't
be!" she protested with a moan. His like
ness rose before herâ tall, broad and a bit
stern of face. Then,, going hot and cold
by turns she sank down upon the divan
once more and burled her head in the
pillows.
and she passed out smiling into the hall.
A moment later she opened the door again
and thrusting her head into the room said
in an enigmatical. manner:
"By the way, Con, be sure to tell Doug
las Stane that when he asks you!" Then
before her cousin could reply she van
ished, slamming the door behind her.
Constance stood in the' middle of the
room for a moment perfectly motionless,
wondering If she could have heard aright.
Douglas Stane a widower! For, of course,
that was what Mary meant. Douglas
Stane a widower!â and in the four months
in which they had been growing dally
fonder of each other she had never before
heard the fact mentioned.
With a quick movement she glided to
ward the door and locked it. Then with
her hands clasped with painful tightness
she stood In the middle of the room and
repeated with growing ", incredulity, "A
widower! Douglas Stane a widower!"
X"For .shame!" she; said, hotly. "For
shame !"\Do you think any woman will
love you better for Ignoring herâ that
"My dear, dear love." He took both of
the small hands in his own and stood
looking down at her, struggling to speak
calmly.
"You. knowâ you. must know," he went
on eagerly, "that you are the only woman
on' earth to me. How I -lived all these
years without you I do not know. I can't
face life without yoo~any longer. I never
knew what It was to live' until I met
you-"
A quick change came over Constance's
face; oven In the dim light he saw it and
wondered, and she wrenched her hands
away. ; â¢ .
"Deserted us. already," he laughed, his
voice a little shaken by the great question
that trembled on his lips.
"Let's hurry and' catch up with them,"
suggested his companion.
"How extremely, unflattering!" came
his answer. "I was Just longing to have
you all to myself."
lie tried to speak lightly, but eagerness
vibrated In his voice. They had emerged
from the grove and stood at the edge of
the rocks.
MJss Singleton seemed bent upon aiding
him for she and her fiance were lost to
sight around a bend of the road. Stane
"hoo-hop-ed" after the manner of . the
cottagers in the neighborhood, but- no an

the foot of the lawn. If Constance jumped
at the conclusion that Douglas Stane was
a widower Just because she had said
"Tell that to Douglas Stane when he
asks you." it was. her own fault.
Meantime that young lady's greeting to
Mr. Stane was a trifle stiff, but r.o one but
her tormenting cousin noticed it. The
gentleman himself seemed utterlv uncon
scious. He had determined to lÂ«arn his
fate, and" in the grip of that mighty re
solve all minor things escaped his notice.
"I just accepted for both of us, because
I knew you would. like to go." Then she
continued under her ." breath, "Poor old
Douglas. Wouldn't Mike to hear what
she says to him. How shall I ever make
ray peace with them, I wonder?" :'
When, the dinner over, they sat on the
broad piazza in the twilight, she half re
gretted her prank and decided to speak.
But before her ' good intention crystal
lized into words, Constance spoke to her,
and at the studied Indifference of the lat
ter's voice and the marked ennui of her
manner, all her love of mischief returned.
"I never before heard you mention that
Mr. Stane Is a widower," she said, pat
ting her lips, with one of her fingers to
discourage a yawn.
"Didn't you?" queried Mary Innocently.'
"Perhaps I never did mention it." Then,
at the sound of footsteps on the gravel,
she addedraiher hurriedly, "Don't- lay it
up against the poor fellow, though."
Two dark figures were approaching from
Constance opened her lips with the evi
dent intention of declining. But before
she could speak her cousin continued
glibly:
until the striking of the clock reminded
her that the dinner hour was at 'hand.
Jumping up, she began to dash cold water
over her flushed face and wet eyes, while
she tried to steady her surging emotions.
"Everything went wrong," she apolo
gized when she> appeared at' the dinner
table,- rather flurrfed and breathless.
"Couldn't get my hair up right-hooks
wouldn't hook and Buttons wouldn't but
ton." f
Her cousin smiled.
"'Methinks the lady doth protest too
much," she thought to herself.
"Dick Just telephoned," she announced,
feeling rather small and guilty, as she
noted Constance's flushed face and fever
ish eyes. "He- and Douglas Stane aro
coming up* after dinner ; to take us down
to the Spouting Rock."
| "You girls with fine sentiments," Mary
retorted teasingly, her hand on the door-
Vr.ub, "r.rs Jur.t the o-vvj to loÂ«k "u* for,"
Her tone implied that the thing was
well-nigh unimaginable, but her cousin
only laughed a bit skeptically and took
the othfr side of the question.
"Do you mean to say that becausÂ« a
person has loved onceâ he or she. for that
matterâ cannot love again without feel
ing that it is a rehash of the old love?"
she asked with a yawn. "My dear girl,
you're all wrong! The second love is
simply a different matter."
"The average human being," she con
tinued shrewdly, "is capable of a good
many loves. I don't at all believe in these
one-love individualsâ the sort who mourn
forever, you know. That sort of thing is
simply emotional poverty."
Having delivered herself of this wordly
observation she glanced at the clock and
began to coil up her loosened hair in a
way that signified that it was time, that
she went to her room to dress for dinner.
"Soulless creature," taunted Constance
with an indulgent, but gently superior air.
'.'Defend widowers if you choose, but none
of them for me!"
"Just fancy." Constance continued with
scornful derision, "being a man's second
choice, listening to a rehash of his first
lovemaking. Gracious!"

Her cousin. Mary Singleton, a practical
young woman, more given to jests than
sentiment, eyed her curiously, but did not
speak.
I otherâ the one who in other years was
*'all the world* to you?"
She stoppod, unable to go further, be
cause the teara were choking her. A look
of blank amazement overspread Stane's
face, and he stared at her with eyes that
were a concentrated interrogation.
"Oh, it seems to me," she went on, pas
sionately, "that If I were a man and had
once loved a woman well enough to marry
her. and she had died, I'd be a little bit
true to her memory! If I wanted care,
companionship, whatever it is that men
remarry for, I'd say so, instead of pre
tending that I had never really loved be
fore!"
Had she been less wrought up by her
feelings she might have noticed that dur
ing this tirade several expressions flutter
ed like shadows across her lover's face.
Astonishment gave way to understanding,
and that in turn to a grim determination.
"I see," he said, slowly, but In a. voice
. whose ring made her look up at h^n with
the conviction that he was no longer a
suppliant for her. favor. "You reject my

"Because you have been married be

"Jealous of a dead woman," he mused,
looking at her through eyes narrowed to
a mere ' silt. ' "Ah. me!" Â¦
Then, as If the episode were closed, he
asked, quietly, "Shall -we return to the
house?"
She felt suddenly terrified, bereft. She
had expected something very differentâ
. expostulationâ self-justlflcatlon. A mighty
struggle' was going on within her. But
above the din of contending feelings she
heard one clear cry, ,"I love htm^ I love
him!" and she held out her hands aa be
seechingly as a child.
"You poor, silly "little girl!" he whis
pered in a voice of great Â¦ content as he
swept her up in his arms, "who ever told

IN SPITE OF PREJUDICE
General Benjamin F. Butler so "hated
shams and hypocrites^n 1 pretenders that
he would sometimes, for the sake of an
epigram, depreciate his own truthfulness
and integrity. "I never," said he on one
occasion, "rtally began to enjoy life until

at his defeat for a seat in Congress by
John Morrissey endeavored to induce him
to contest the election. "Tut, tut, gentle-

opposite political faith gleefully asked
him how he liked the nomination. "Gen
tlemen," said he, "I will answer by tell
jne a little story. In 1849 I was one of
a company of forty co-operative gold
soakers who came around the Horn. Ar

to suit me before.' Well, that's what, aa
a Democrat, I have to say about the nom
ination of Horace Greeley."
I had lost the last scrap of my reputa
tion." His wit was aa keen 'as a razor,
and as merciless. Of Judge Ebenezcr R.
Hoar, Grant's first Attorney General, lie
paid: "ilis most prominent characteristic
is his ungeniality. When he was on the
Supreme Judicial Bench in Massachusetts
his constant grief was that he could not
decide against both the appellant and ap
pellee." Of a Southern denator who was
generally accredited with selling his
vote whenever a. market could be found,
he eaid: "His statesmanship fits the defi
nition that the Chinese give to geometry
âthe science of the how much."
Once, however, Butler was worsted in
repartee. It was during a session of the
House Committee on Reconstruction, of
which he was chairman. There had been
a heated discussion, and General John V.
Farnswcrth of Illinois had bitterly op
posed a radical measure favored by But
ler, who sharply criticized Farnswcrtn for
his alleged abandonment of Republican
doctrine. Farnsworth rtplie.1 txcitedly:
"The chairman questions my Republican
ism. Why, I was a Republican when he
was chasing fugitive slaves all over the
State of Massachusetts." Butler rejoined:
"There are people who prefer Judas Is
cariot to Paul, on the ground that Judas
was the oldest of the original disciples."
"I question the statement," said Farns
worth, "that Judaa was the oldest of the
original disciples and I shall dispute it

Your persistent refusal to enter polygamy

self." "But, President Young, I have
reasons," said Hooper. "Yes,' 1 interrupted
Erigham, "I know all about that, but I
have reasons also. Now there is Sister
Thompson, who died last year, and Sister
Brown, who passed away a nioi.th ago,

"And, woii'-d yon believe it?" said the
subject of this Incident, "Senator Fenton

word in my favor, while Roscoe Conkling

pointment as a personal favor to himself,
and I got the place."'
and often offended his clansmen even
when he served them. A member of the
New York Legislature who had voted for
both Conklir.g and Fenton desired a
small South American Consulship, and he
sought the good offices of both Senators
to stoure the appointment from President
Grant. The applicant went to the door
of the United States Senate chamber and
sent In his card to Senator Fenton. That
gentleman came into the lobby, politely
greeted his constituent, listened to his
story, took his petition, promised to pre

pointment and left the office seeker full
of ho^e. A card was then sent to Sena
tor Conkling, who in a few minutes capie

his constituent, exclaimed. "Well, sir,
what can I do for you?" The gentleman
responded, stating hia wishes, and re
questing the efforts and Influence of the.

unhappy man and. drawing himself to his
full height, exdairm.d: "Sr, your con
duct is indecent. How dare you call a
Senator of the United States from his
seat for such a purpose as this?" and
thereupon the Senator turned bis back
upon the crestfallen applicant and walked
away.
Mr. Elaine was a capital raconteur, and
never suppressed a good story because the
Joke wag on himself. He related on one
occasion how an old farmer had vindi
cated him at a town meeting in Maine.
"The habit that some folks has." said the
old man, "of lyln' about public men' is

FERNANDO WOOD. ex-Mayor of
New York City, and for many
years one of its representatives in
Conpress. was. In graciousness of
manner, in courteousness of de
porimcnt and in costume a gentleman of
the o!d school.
After the strictest of his sect he lived
and tiled a Democrat, but all the darkies
employed sbout the Federal Capitol loved
him for his kindly spirit and for the size
ami Frequency of his tips. Among his fa

associates, collected $SÂ°0. added $200 from
Lis own pocket and presented it to John
son, who, with his own savings was then
the possessor of $800. which he deposited
with Riggs & Co. Mr. Wood next inter
ested hiinstlf to secure for Johnson a

hcte;, from whicii it was estimated that
J*a) could be derived during the season,
thus mailing up the sum cf $1200 necc-s
euiy to purchasa the woman and her

liefore the season opened at Saratoga
Fort Sumter was tired up^n, an extra ses
sion of Congress was cal.ed and Johnson
relinquished his Saratoga lease and was
L"iick in h'.a place a: Washington ready
to wait upon his Cor.sressionai friends.
"This Is too bad," said ilr. Wood, as
he stttied himself in the Larter's chair.
"We will have to nuke up a little more

You haven't spent any of that money,

Wood. The barber applied the lather vig
orously to the Congressman's chin and rt>

mighty cheap befo* dis wah is ovah."
Of all latter-day American statesmen
none so occupied public attention in his
lifetime or died so utterly when he died
as James G. Elaine, lie impressed his
Individuality strongly upon those about
him, but It did not extend to those with
.whom he did not come in personal con
tact. He had quickness of perception to
a remarkable degree, but lacked breadth
and depth and prescience. With every
appearance of unselfish devotion to pub
lic interests, he estimated and dealt with
measures and with men in their bearing
upon his own fortunes, rather than the
public welfare. He did not lower his hel
met when the fight was on. but he did not
hesitate to stoop to conquer, and he was
a lukewarm friend and a placable enemy.
He was a born diplomat. He was power

speech, but his addresses were for hia
Immediate audience, ar.d he indorsed Sir
Eoyle Reach In saying, "What has pos
terity done for us?" His motto was that
of Danton, "L'audace. l'audace. toujours

possessed more robust health he might
have reached the goal of his ambition,

Horace Greeley is a great historic fig

potential id tc rial writer of his genera*
tion. Defeated by tne several managers
for a seat in the Republican National
Convention of 18C0 from. New York, he ap
peared duly accredited as a delegate from
Oregon, and he was a powerful ' factor in
procuring the defeat of Seward for the
nomination. He was the idol of hundreds
ot thousands of voters who were interest
ed in political success, not to secure the
triumph of men, but the establishment of
principles. It is an undecided question,
whether the white hat on the back of the
bald head, the long white coat and the
trousers tucked in the boot leg were de

there was no question as to the power of

y% OGOTA, Colombia, Nov. 12.â President Marroquin
ffâÂ£! has made a strong appeal to the Latin- American Presi
g Jy dents for. support, in a .war to; retake Panama. ' He
declares Colombia 'will resist; by all possible means in
her, power, .the. separation of the isthmus, and adds that the
plentiful resources; and. patriotic blood of the nation will be used,
if necessary, to prevent the independence of Panama,
â¢The publicity of the President's message this morning has
caused intense feeling at the' capital. -On every side the Govern
ment is assured -of" financial support and. banks have offered their
capital to aid in reconquering" the; isthmus. ; Patriotic citizens
have tendered "their wealth , and services and. many committees
have been formed to raise funds to prosecute the campaign.
â¢.^ .There. is the greatest confidence, however, -that General
Reyes' mission will 'meet' with success, t President Marroquin also
is hopeful of favorable Replies to his message from the neighbor

order or by the spirit -which justified -'the 'independence .from

LONDON, Nov. 14.â The news Â©f the
operation on Kaiser Wllhelm was natur
ally followed with keen Interest in medi
cal circles of London, for as the Lancet
says, the feeling of every medical man
on recalling that in a man of 45 years,
whose father died from cancer of the
larynx and whose mother succumbed to
cancer of the breast, larynglcal polypus
had been discovered, was naturally one of
uneasiness.
The Lancet, however, deduces from th*
data made public that a speedy recovery
may be looked for and commends the
courage and good sense of the Emperor
in taking the world* into his confidence
and thereby preventing dissemination of
much sinister rumor and idle gossip. An
other' British medical authority, who, in
days gone by, has been intimately asso
ciated ' with doctors of his Majesty for
minor complaints, has gKen some inter
esting details as to what manner of pa
tient William II is. This physician is
quoted as saying: "The Kaiaer is -not at
all a bad patient when he once thoroughly
understands what is wrong with himself."
The first thing to which he gives his at
tention when a note of alarm is sounded
is to diagnose himself on his own account.
He is of a most embarrassingly Inquisi
tive disposition and piles his physician
with all kinds of questions about his par
ticular ailment, which is said to be pursu
ing him, and as likely as not hÂ« will then
send for a medical treatise on the subject
and read it up. When he has submitted
he becomes a little sterner than usual and
is inclined to fret somewha^ The pre
scription which he most dreads is abso
lute rest and he is a great believer in hla
own ability to force himself to health.
But when once he is In his doctors' hands
he carries out their instructions implicitly
and shows the greatest confidence in their
capability. In reference to Dr. O'to
Schmidt's treatment of cancer the Lancet
has this: "Before Schmidt's theory as to
the exact causation of the malignant dÂ»s
ease can be accepted by the medical pro
fession it will be necessary for very
much more evidence to be produced as to
the exact nature of the parasite or as to
the kind of tumor which was produced
by induction." *
Nothing Irrelevant is said In Dr.
Schmidt's description of parasite. It may
be in a sense comprehensive, but fa want
ing in many details of proof which would
be required by a pathologist before the
validity of any one's claim to be the dis
coverer of the law of cancer can be se
riously considered. However, it may be
conceded that exact proof as to causation
Is immaterial if only Dr. Schmidt can
show that he has In truth discovered the
long sought for cure of one- of the most
distressing of all diseases.

Upon being questioned Otto said that his
confinement in the hospital was caused
by the belief of persons in San Francisco

that it was then a well known Australian

REDDING, Nov. 14.â Elgin Camp, a
well-known young man of this city, met
with a peculiar and painful accident Sat
urday morning. Camp had taken his
shotgun and gone out for a hunt. He
was about three miles from town, and
after shooting several times a wad in
some unaccountable manner became
lodged In the gun barrel and all of Camp's
efforts failed to dislodge it. He decided
to shoot it out and proceeded to do so.
As the hammer struck the cap there was
a terriffc explosion. The gun was shat
tered and Camp knocked to the ground.
When he recovered he was sickened to
see the condition of his left hand. The
flesh and fingernails had been stripped
from the fingers of the left hand and
hung in shreds like tissue. Tho hand
may have to bo amputated as the result
of the accident. The bones are shattered
and leaves the hand a pulpy mass.

The police at once started in to round
up the villainous band. They captured
Burton, McCarthy and Quinn near the
scene of the fight, but the. remaining four
are still at large. The officers are on their
trail and hope- to apprehend them before
many hours. The three men captured
were locked up at thÂ© Southern police
station.
When the murderous hoodlums per
ceived that their victim was seriously In
jured, every one of them made his escape
in a hurry. A passerby heard the groans
of tho suffering man and notified the po
lice at thÂ© . Harbor Station. Kuger was
removed to the Harbor Hospital and later
to St. Mary's. The attending physicians
say there is but slight hope for his recov
ery, as all the wounds are deep ones and
the unfortunate man is very weak from
the loss of blood.
At last Kuger interfered and told them
to be quiet or he would put them out. In
an Instant a general fight ensued, j With a
volley of oaths and vile epithets the
crowd attacked the grocer, and during
the cowardly one-sided fight that ensued
he was stabbed four times, twice in the
breast, once in the abdomen and once in
the thigh. .: â¢
When assistance reached the unfortu
nate grocer his life's blood was fast flow
ing away, yet he retained consciousness
long enough- to tell how the fatal affair
occurred. Between gasps the injured man
said that the crowd entered his place at
12:30. The men were drunk and they be
came abusive and Insulting and began to
break the furniture in the place.
Martin Kuger,' proprietor of a grocery
and barroom at 600 Se.cond street, lies at
the point of ! death in a ward at St.

free-for-all fight started in 'his place by
a crowd of seven hoodlums. Kueer was
stabbed four times. R. T. Burton, John

soon after the fray and locked up In the

their escape. , r
Telegraphic communication with the In

But therÂ© arÂ© more than physical ob
stacles In the way of the approach of an
army upon Panama. The officials do not
care to express publicly their plans, but
It is assumed here that the "army"
said to be marching en Panama was
nothing more than the few men â perhaps
BOO all toldâ who were about to embark
at Buena Ventura a few days ago, when
they wore turned back from the isthmus
by notice of the determination of the
United States naval commanders to al
low no landings in that quarter. These
troops cannot reach thÂ© isthmus by water
and thÂ© officials herÂ© are positive that
they cannot do so by land. The charac
ter of the country is such that there is
.no subsistence for an army on the route
of the wild mountain trails and the pas
sages through the morasses that He be
tween Colombia proper and the isthmus.
Even if there were subsistence, the trails
are bo rough that it would require many
weeks, or even months, for even a small
army to make thÂ© Journey.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â The State
Department has no knowledge of the
march of any army from Colombia upon
the isthmus and the offlciale say that were
any such movement made they certainly
would be informed by their agents In
the south, the cables being Etill open.
These officials Bcout the Idea that any
Â¦uch march is in progress as the Presi
dent of Colombia Is reported to have de
scribed to the President of Ecuador.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â President
Roosevelt embraced the opportunity af
forded by the call upon him of a large
representation of both the Senate and
House to-day to discuss with members of
both the majority and the minority the
situation which has arisen out of the es
tablishment of the Republic of Panama.
The nature of the action, if any, to be
taken by Congress during the approach
ing session on thÂ© Panama Canal situa
tion has' not been determined definitely,
but it is known that it Is constantly the
subject of conferences between the pres
ident and members of- Congress.
. A difference of opinion has been devel
oped regarding thÂ© authority conferred
by the Spooner act upon the President.
It is known that the administration
bolds that the Spooner act supplies am-

to reach her destination to-morrow or
Monday. It is expected that thÂ© cruiser
Baltimore, now In Dominican waters, and
the training-ship Prairie, conveying ma
rines to Guantanamo, will be added to the
fleet on the east coast of the* isthmus.
PANAMA PROBLEM DEBATED.
But it is known that such were the
plans of the naval commanders, and *3
there is no indication of a change '.n
thoÂ»o plans not the slightest apprehension
Is felt here of the â¢ encroachment of any
Colombian army upon Panama.
A brief dispatch from Rear Admiral
Glass announced the arrival at Panama
yesterday of the monitor Wyoming.
There are now seven vessels guarding tne
ir.terests of the United States on thÂ© isth
mus. Of these four are on the Pacific
sideâ the cruisers Boston and Marbte
head, the gunboat Concord and the mon
itor Wyoming. So far as known no other
naval vessels, . except, possibly, ! colliers
and supply boats, will bo sent to tnÂ«
west side of the isthmus for the prejent.
On the AUantlc side ar the- cruiaer At
lanta, the gunboat Nashville and tho
training-ship Dixie. This fleet will bÂ© re
inforced in a day or two by the battleship
Maine and thÂ© President's yacht May
flower. tfi\;*i?-:i
enough has been gleaned from thÂ© in
structions given to our naval commanders
to make ft evident that never again will
the isthmus become the seat of warfare
so long as the United States Government
can prevent it. The difference between
the situation and that which existed last
year, when Commander McLean prevent
ed the troops crossing the Isthmus by
rail, is Just this: The authorities have
now determined to extend the lines of
protection to the railroad. They will not
allow hostile forces, no matter whether
they are Colombian or Panama troops, to
come into collision anywhere near the
railroad, and to prevent such collisions it
will be necessary to extend the neutral
zone clear to the northern and Southern
boundaries of the republic of Panama.
Officials here will not make snch a
statement publicly; they simply say:
"Walt until the emergency arises." i
all possible means within her power. She will not spare the
country's plentiful resources nor the blood of her patriotic sons
in regaining that which is temporarily lost."

Who Take Dr\ Shoop's Restorative
A Montlrat My Risk.
- A
And that is Just what I Â«Ive. \
Not a penny expense to you if myvRestoratlve falls.
With me, It Is Blmpiy, how c*n I get the sick to use Dr.
Shoop's Restorative that they may find out for themselvesâ with-
out riskâ what my prescription canio?
If the sick all knew what I know tt this remedy, then no offer
like this need be made. But some do not. Some may never have
even heard of Dr. Shoop's Restorative. And It Is to Just such that
I make this appeal.
I am enthusiastic. My enthusiasm is due to knowledge â to ac-
tual experience obtained in hospitals and at bedsides with this
prescription. I must reach those not well. I must bring to them
the help they desire, that they, in turn, may" make known to
other sufferers what Dr. Shoop's Restorative has done for them.
And to do this quickly and without delay, I give to everybodyâ
everywhereâ an opportunity to use my remedy a full month on trial.
My past records show that I have failed In only one case out of
each 40 where this month test was made. Just think of that. 29
paid gladly, and. the fortieth had no expense. That Is a record I
am proud of.
Those who know about my Restorative â who have used Itâ care
nothing about my "month's te3t." They keep it in the home con-
Etantly, as a safeguard. When an off day comes a few doses
set things right again. To them It is an Insurance again3t serious
.attacksâ against continued illness. < ,^>
How to Secure Trial Treatment.
Write me and*slmply ask for the book you need. A postal will
do, or sign the coupon. Then I will arrange with a druggist near
you, so that you can secure six bottle3 of Dr. Shoop's Restorative
to make the test. Send me no money. You deal with your drug-
.gist, remember. Use the Restorative a full monthâ then decide. If
U succeeds the cost to you Is $5.50; .if it fails I will have thÂ«
druggist bill the cost to me. Could anything be more fair?
To delay means to forget. Write now, while you have it la
mind. This la Important.

The danger in the use of celuloid arti
cles is greatly, increased. The original
patent having expired, a vast number of
imitation processes have sprung up, and
the public are flooded with combs made
from guncotton compounds by methods
which render them more dangerous than
those prepared under the original patent.
That sqme restriction should be placed
on its indiscriminate use was proved by
the recent case of a girl, 20 years of age,
who was suffering from cullulltis of the
scalp, accompanied by a marked degree
of nervous shock. It appeared that her
head had been set on fire by the sudden
combustion of a comb which she wore in
her hair. Cooking her father's dinner
one Sunday, she happened to bend down
before the fire, when the comb suddenly
ignited and she became enveloped in
flames. Her life was only spared through
the presence of mind of her father, who
immediately enveloped her with the
hearth rug and so extinguished the con
flagration.âNew Orleans Times-Demo

PERSONAL MENTION.
George Owings was so .weakened from
the loss of blood from the gash cut in his
head and is in such a terrible condition
that he may not recover. . The brothers
have not been placed under arrest, owing
to their condition. ,';.
Lewis Owings was hit and dropped out
of the fight while George Owirjgs and
Johnson, both of whom had used up all
of their ammunition, engaged in a hand
to-hand conflict. Although Johnson suc
ceeded in dealirfg Owings a terrible blow
on the head with a branding iron, the
latter overpowered and tied up his op
ponent. He assisted his brother to a
horse and. mounting his own animal, the
two men rode into Willcox, arriving there
in an exhausted condition.
A sixshooter proved too great a tempta
tion in the hands of the old gunmen after
fiv e years' restraint, and they made free
use of their guns in their first fight since
leaving the prison, which occurred
Thursday at the Sulphur Springs ranch.
The Owings boys, after leaving Yuma.
went straight to the ranch of David
Johnson at Sulphur Springs, near Will
cox. Johnson, who had befriended the
two men in the past, employed them as
cowboys on the ranch and everything
went well until Thursday, when he un
earthed a plot which had been fixed up
by the brothers to make way with a
bunch of Johnson's best horses and ride
with them across the Mexican line.
The trouble occurred when Johnson and
several of the other men upon the place
confronted the two Owings with evi
dence of the plot they had discovered. A
few hot words were exchanged, when
both of the Owings drew their guns and
began shootinc. Jchnson and his men
took refuge behind several outbuildings
and Johnson himself, who was the only
one of the party armed, replied to the
fire, while the others fled to shelter.

said that he caught a glimpse of a man

side of the building from Hulse's room.

one Hulse had on when arrested, but the
witness caught only a momentary sight
and when he attempted to follow him he
found the door locked. There was an
exit to the street in front from the room
in which the man fled and he could easily
have escaped there, and there was no
guard there at the time. .
Tower, in company with Sheriff Kelly,
arrested Hulse and told the story of the
prisoner's sudden appearance on L street
when the officers were looking for him,
and his surrender without resistance.
Tower was still on the stand when court
adjourned. The clothes worn by Hulse at
! the time of his arrest were introduced in
evidence to-day. ''â¢â¢ '
BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 14.â The most
important point yet > raised in the 'Hulse
case came up to-day when Sheriff .Kelly
was allowed to state that when Deputy
Sheriff Tibbet was bornÂ© from the yard
of. the joss house he knew that he could
not recover and told- those about him
that "he expected to die. j
When this question waa asked- by At
torney Packard thÂ© defense immediately
objected and the jury was withdrawn.
Packard then stated that he intended to
introduce witnesses" to whom Tibbet' had
stated that Hulse was the man who shot
him and he desired now to show that
these statements were made under fear of
death. Strenuous objection was offered
by the defense, but Judge Mahon over
ruled the objection, saying: "The admls
slbillty of a dying statement is summed
up in the words 'fear of ' Impending
death.' "

HAY WRITES TO PARDEE.

Legation's Complaint.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 14.-Governor
Pardee this afternoon received from Sec
retary of State jftin Hay a telegram call
ing his attention to outrages' upon Chi
nese alleged to have been committed In
the mines of Tuolumno County. The mes
sage reads as follows:
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 14, 1903.-
To His Excellency; George C. Pardee,
Governor of California: .... ,
"It is represented to the Chinese Lega
tion here that Chinese laborers at the
Black Oak mine, near Sonora, have been
driven from their work, and that their

"I have to request that you > will .cause

protection of these Chinese subjects . and
prevent violation of their rights. .
Â¦ "JOHN HAY, Secretary of State."
Governor Pardee immediately caused
copies of the message from Secretary of
State Hay to be taken and' sent to the
Sheriff and . District Attorney . of. Tuo

course of a few. days a report will be
received by the Governor from.those.of

FRENCH DEPUTIES
y ENGAGE HT A DUEL
ROME, Nov. 14.â Dr. B. F. de Costa.
formerly a dJÂ»tlng-ulshed Episcopal minis
ter of Xew Tork, who came to Rome
last January to study with a view to en
tering the Roman Catholic priesthood,
has been obliged to go to Flesole, near
Florence, because of poor health. Dr.
de Costa has become so seriously 11] that
It has been decided to hasten his ordina
tion. He will be made a deacon Novem
ber 22 and a priest November 29.

Arrjftrit'a.T} Minister Who Is Studying
I>TL PE COSTA'S HEALTHPA1LS.
A valuable rind was made, written' in
Latin, giving the text of the epistles to
the Hebrews and epitome of Hvy's six
lost books. This, with other papyri, cov
ering the period 150-137 B. C. threw much
new and valuable light on the history
of the world and marked the recovery
of hitherto classical literature of Egypt.
A quaint Instance of the business methods
In vogue in 137 B. C. is shown In the dis
covery of an amusing contract whereby
a slave boy was to be taught shorthand
for 120 drachmae. The payment was ar
ranged on a. thoroughly businesslike ba
sis. 40 drachmae down, 40 on satisfactory
evidence of progress and 40 on the at
tainment of proficiency.
Accompanied by Dr. Hunt, Dr. Gren
fell found a rich Ptolemaic necropolis at
El Hlbeh. The bulk ef the documents
from the one mound consisted of a collec
tion of sayings of Jesus. They are all
Introduced with the words, "Jesus salth,"
and for the most part are new. The ends
of the lines, unfortunately, are often
obliterated. Apparently all the sayings
were addressed to St. Thomas. One of
the most remarkable Is:
"Let not him that seeketh cease from
his search until he finds, and when he
finds be shall wonder; wondering he shall
reach the kingdom, i. e.. the kingdom of
hi aven, and when he reaches the king
dom he shall have rest."
Dr. Grenfell remarked that enormous
interest would be also aroused by the
discoveries on account of the variations
they disclosed from accepted texts.
One variant of mystical saying, record
ed in St. Luke, "The kingdom of God
is with you." was of great value, as the
saying in the papyrus appeared in quite
different surroundings from those attrib
uted to it by the evangelist and extend
ed far into another region.
According to Dr. Grenfell these say-
Ings formed the new gospel which is tra
<Utionally associated with St. Thomas.
An Interesting variation of the gospel
according to St. Luke, eleventh chapter
and City-second verse, "Woe unto you
lawyers, for ye have taken away the
key of knowledge; yet entered not in
yourselves and them that were entering
in ye hindered." reads in the papyrus,
"Ye have hidden the key of knowledge,
ye entered not yourselves and to them
that were entering in ye did not open."
Another fragment contained a discourse
of Christ closely related to passages of
the sermon on the mount and a conver
sation between Christ and his disciples,
in which Christ answers a question as
to when his kingdom will be realized,
saying;
"When ye return to the state of inno
cence which existed before the fall."
LONDON. Nov. 14.â Many hitherto ua
known sayings of Jesus Christ have been
discovered in Egypt by archaeologUts,
who lave dug up papyri buried since/the
second century. 109 miles south of Cairo.
Dr. Bernard P. GrenXell, t who has been
engaged in Egyptian, excavations, since
ZSH. at the general meeting of the' Egypt
exploration fund held yesterday gave the
following details:
Interesting Discovery Made
by Scientists Near
Cairo.
There were seven Email rooms in the
school, each with Its various kinds of
brick. In one room were found bricks
with grammatical exercises. The scholars
evidently sat on the ground in rows with
soft clay bricks in their hands, painfully
forming the hard cuneiform letters.
Father Scheil says the thumbmarks of
the teacher are to be detected where he
emudged over the scholars' mistakes.
There was a room where advanced schol
ars learned to write the elaborate and
highly poetical forms of adulation often
eeen on Babylonian monuments. Much
Importance was attached to learning
weights and measures, to arithmetic and
geometry, but the chief branches were
grammar, writing and the expression of
adulatory forms.
There la evidence that girls got pretty
zeuch the same education as boys and
Father 6chell found contracts In which
the language and law had been revised
by a learned woman named Amat Baon.
There Is evidence that a pupil was occu
pied with learning to write from seven
to fourteen years.
BEKXJX, Nov. 14.â RÂ«v. Vincent Scheil.
a German priest, making: excavations in
an ancient Babylonian city, has unearthed
a school just as It was 4000 years ago In
the time of King Hammurabi.
It Is a email house of eunburnt brick
and stands in the midst of the most popu
lous district of the city of Seapur, Just
opposite the great temple. It has many
Inscribed brick, from the cuneiform ln
ecriptions on which Father Scheil has re
constructed the life of the ancient Baby
lonian school. One brick says: "He who
learns to write well in the school will
ehlne as the sun."

action was taken on the basis of tho re
port made by Professor Robert Her/ick,
who is ' at the head of the ' rhetoric sec
tion of the university. It was consid
ered to be in ; line with the general trend
of the entire conference.

ThÂ« memorial committee of thÂ© United
Ancient Order of Druids, composed of
representatives from all the local groves
In this city and the circles, as well as the
Past Arch Association and the chapter
branches of the order, held a meeting: In
the Druids* Temple on Butter street last
night and effected a permanent organiza
tion by the election of L. M. Pabbry,
chairman; Mrs. Prances J. Williams, vice
chairman; W. G. Antonovich, secretary,
and D. Bamman, treasurer.
2t was decided to hold the service out
of respect to the memory of the dead of
the order in Golden Gate Hall on the
afternoon of February 3, 1904, and for the
purpose of carrying out the details com
mittees on finance, hall, decoration and
electric effects, talent, printing, promo
tion and publicity and visitation of groves
and circles were appointed.
It Is the intention of the committee on
decorations to -introduce several novel ef

add much to the lmpressiveness of the
occasion, and to present some ! features
that will brinsr out the idea of Druidic
veneration in broader lines than in the

In order Uiat affairs connected with the
settlement of the Fair estate In Califor
nia mlg-ht be readily adjusted, a power
of attorney wu tfven to Hermann Oel
richs by his wife, a daughter of tbe late
Senator Fair. A similar power of attor
ney was sTiven to Mr. Oelrichs by Mrs.
Vanderbilt, another daughter of Senator
Fair. Under the powers granted Mr.
Oelrichs settled up the general affairs of
the estate and resigned the trust. The
resignation was given to Reuben H. Lloyd
three months ago and the powers of at
torney granted to Mr. Oelrichs were then
returned to the ladies in New York. In
reference to this story Mr. LJoyd says:
"There is nothing new in this matter.
Three months ago Mr. Oelrichs resigned
and I then returned to the ladies in New
York the papers conferring upon him the
power of attorney In the Fair estate."
There is gossip in New York to the ef
fect that Hermann Oelrichs has revoked a
power of attorney given to Mrs. Oelrichs.
Mr. Lloyd remarks that such gossip is
devoid of truth. HÂ© fancies that Mrs.
Oelrichs does not hold and never has held
a power of attorney to act for him in
New York, for the simple reason that
there is no necessity for such grant of
authority.
The building of the Fairmont Hotel is
an enterprise in which Mr. Oelrichs takes
a deep interest. In this Investment he
is an absolute half owner and is in a po
sition to act according to the promptings
of his own business Judgment. His sur
render of the powers of attorney granted
to him by his wife and his wife's sister
was voluntary on his part and the tiling
of the papers in the Recorder's office sim
ply signifies that his resignation Is ac
cepted.
Business Properties Still Are
Most Eagerly Sought
Fair Estate Is Settled and
Power of Attorney Is
Not Required.
Realty Doesn't Develop
Sensationally but
Holds Strong.

APPETITE'S GONE.
Food eaten without appetite al-
ways causes gastric disturbances,
because unless the glands of the
stomach are stimulated by a de-
sire for food no digestive juices
are formed. Consequently the
food is wasted and clogs up the
bowels. For Loss of Appetite and
Constipation there is nothing to
equal the Bitters. Try a dose be-

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knwws that charcoal Is the
rarest and aort efficient disinfectant and puri-
fier In nature, but few realize ltÂ» value when
taken Into the human system for thÂ« same
ctouisins purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more you take
of it the better; It Is not a drug: at all. but,
simply ettcrbs the cases and Impurities al-
ways present In the stomach and Intestines
and carries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after emoldna;.
drinking or after eatlns; onions and other odor-
ous intertables.
Charccal effectually clears and Improves the
eotrplexlori. It whitens the teeth and further
acts as a ratural and eminently salt cathartic.
It Lbsorha the Injurious rasea which collect
is tbe stomach and bowels; It disinfects the
mouth and throat from the poinon. of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one form or an-
other, but probably the best charcoal and the
meet for tbe money is In Stuart's Absorbent
Lozenges; they are composed of the finest pow-
dered Willow charcoal and other harmless an-
tiseptics In tablet form or rather in tbe form
of large, pleasant tasting lozenges, the charcoal
being mixed with honey.
ThÂ« dally use of these lozenges will soon
tell In a much Improved condition of the gen-
eral health, better complexion, sweeter breath
and purer blood, and the beauty of It Is that
no pcsslble harm can result from their con-
tinued use. tut, en the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in epeaklng of the bene-
fits Of charcoal says: "I advise Stuart's Ab-
â¢obent Uozerges to all patients suffering from
gas In stomach and bowels and to clear the
complexion and ourlfy the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is greatly bene-
fltted by the dally use of them; they cost but
twenty- five cents a box at drug stores, and al-
though in some sense a patent preparation, yet
I believe I *et wore and better charcoal In
Stuart's i Absorbent Iiozenges than in any of
thÂ» ordinary charcoal tablets.

unfavorably _on a proposition that

termed an "insinuation of extravagance,"
made by Delegate George E. VIncens of

clared the expense of the committee en

FROM SUB-COMMITTEES
CHICAGO, Nov. 14.â With the alleged
refusal of the street railway officials to
answer, a reauest for a "peace confer
ence" sent by their striking employes the
latter asserted to-day that no further
overtures looking to an amicable settle
ment of the strike would be made by the
men. Tbe situation has resolved Itself
into a test of endurance, with no disposi
tion on the. part of either side to yield.
In anticipation of a sympathetic strike
of teamsters every effort was made by
the railway officials to get in an adequate
supply of coal for the company's huge
bins. Furthermore preparations were in
progress on a large scale for sleeping and
restaurant accommodations for the non
union men who the officials announce will
operate cars. Officials of the. company
were kept busy rushing cots to the barns
and power houses and buying cooking
utensils and provisions.
A new method of preventing street
blockades was put Into effect to-day by
the^lice. Whenever cars were passing
from the strike district the thoroughfare
used was temporarily closed to all wagon
traffic. The result was to practically
eliminate attempts 'at interference by
teamsters friendly to the strikers. "Under
practically the game police tactics as were
employed yesterday four cars left the
Wentworth avenue barns in the southern
outskirts of the city at 8:40 a. m. and
headed toward the business district, nine
miles distant. Police attended the cars in
patrol wagons, and, almost cordoning
each side of the avenue, made interfer
ence an undertaking of difficulty.
CROWD JEERS. THE POLICE.
A large crowd about the Seventy-sev
enth street barns Jeered and hooted at
the police and carmen as the cars moved
out, but offered no violence. One hun
dred policemen massed at that point kept
the crowd at a safe distance. Eight to
ten policemen were stationed in every
block and the crowds were kept mov
ing. The first round trip was completed
on practically schedule time and was at
tended by no exciting incident.
Meantime the State-street oable, which
had been kept In motion since the strike
began, came to a standstill as the result
of a walkout by engineers and firemen
employed at the power-houses. . .
The first procession of four cars on the
Wentworth avenue line was soon fol
lowed by a second one of six. Besides
eighteen newspaper men on the first car
making a trip to-day there were four
other passengers, making a total of
twenty-two fares rung up on the trip
downtown. The ether cars carried from
five to six passengers, some of whom
were women.
When the hour arrived to-day which
Manager McCulloch, prior to the strike,
fixed for giving the company's answer to
the employes' demand for arbitration,
McCulloch, President Hamilton. Counsel
Bliss and two directors were waiting at
the company offices, but no committee
from the strikers appeared. Soon, how
ever, a note was dispatched from the
union headquarters to Manager McCul
loch, inquiring his attitude toward the
men and his views with reference to meet
ing the men in the light of events since
the question of arbitration was raised.
MESSAGE NOT ANSWERED.
The message from the employes' head
quarters was delivered by a district
messenger boy to a clerk in the general
offices of the railway company. The clerk
took it to McCulloch and presented it and
returned, saying to the boy:
"Mr. McCulloch says there is no answer
to tbe message."
It was learned later that McCulloch and
Counsel Bliss considered . the note for
some time and then returned this answer.
Secretary Bland of the union declared,
upon receiving McCuIloch's reply, that no
further peace overtures would be made
by the union.
The. note sent to McCulloch was signed
by' President Buckley of the striking
union. It was sent for the asserted pur
pose of ascertaining definitely the senti
ment of the company with Â¦ regard to
meeting the men. It was as follows:
"Robert McCulloch, General Manager
City Railway Companyâ Cear Sir: The
morning papers report that you are ready
and willing to meet our committee. Now.
we have not received any notification or
information from you that such a meeting
is desired, but if you desire to meet our
committee we are ready to meet you at
any time or place you may .designate to
take up negotiations looking to a settle
ment." â¢
Coal .wagons were halted to-day at the
doors of power-houses by union teamsters
and delivery refused to non-union flre-
Glenn Cairns, secretary of the State
Board of Arbitration, who went to Trini-
Cnd to offer the services of the board Â¦ as
a mediator in the strike, has reported
that, while the strikers were willing to
confer with their employers with the Idea
of arranging for arbitration, the corpora
tions declared they had nothing to arbi
trate. Neither the "officials of the'Colo
rado Fuel and Iron Company nor those
of the Victor Fuel. Company would give
the board any encouragement. J
It Is reported that negotiations are
pending for a consolidation of the United
Mine Workers of America and the West
ern Federation of Miners. .President Moy
er of the Western Federation admitted
to-day that the subject was under con
sideration, but would not say Just how far
negotiations had progressed. .

A TEST EXPERIMENT.
Peculiar Power Possessed by a New
Medicine.
, - Of new discoveries there Is no end. but
I one of tbe most recent, most remarkable
and one that will prove Invaluable to
thousands of people is a discovery which
j It la believed will take tbe place of all
; other remedies for the cure of those com
I znon and obstinate diseases, dyspepsia and
etomach troubles. This discovery Is not a
' loudly advertised, secret patent medicine,
. but Is a scientific combination of whole-
* come, perfectly harmless vegetable es-
j fences, fruit salts, pure pepein and bls-
, xnuth.
These remedies are combined in locenre
'form, pleasant to take and will preserve
Â¦ their rood qualities indefinitely, whereas
all liquid medicines rapidly lose whatever
I good qualities they may have had as soon
as uncorked and exposed to the air.
This preparation is called Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets, and It is claimed that one
"of these Tablets or lozenges will digest
from S00 to 2000 times its own weight of
(neat, eggs and other wholesome food.
And this claim has been proven by actual
experiments In the following manner: A
hard boiled egg cut into small pieces was
placed in a bottle containing warm water
heated to ninety-eight degrees (or blood
heat); one of these Tablets was then
placed In the bottle and tbe proper tem-
perature maintained for three hours and
a half, at the end of which time the egg
Â«*as as completely digested as it would
fcave been in a healthy stomach. This ex-
periment was undertaken to demonstrate
! that what it would do in the bottle it
would also do In the stomach, hence its
unquestionable value In the cure of dys-
. pepsla and weak digestion. Very few
people are free from some form of lndl-
eestion, but scarcely two will have the
came symptoms. Some will suffer most
from distress after eating, bloating from
gas in the stomach and bowels; others
i have add dyspepsia or heartburn; others
Â¦ palpitation or headache, sleeplessness,
: pains in chest and under shoulder blades,
â¢extreme nervousness as in nervous dys-
pepsia, but they all have the same cause-
failure to properly digest what Is eaten.
â¢ The stomach must have rest and assist-
ance, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give
It both by digesting the food for it, and in
a short time it is restored to its normal
. action and vigor. At the same time the
Tablets are so harmless that a child can
take them with benefit. This new prepa-
ration has already made many astonishing
"cures, as, for instance, the following:
After using only one package of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia. Tablets I have received
euch great and unexpected benefit that I
.wish to express my sincere gratitude. In
fact.. It has been six months since I took
the package, and I have not had one par-
ticle of distress or difficulty since. And all
this in the face of the fact that the best
doctors I consulted told me my case was
Chronic Dyspepsia and absolutely incura-
ble, as I had suffered twenty-five years
I distributed half a dozen packages among
my friends here, who are very anxious to
try this remedy.

manager and principal owner of the Wool

city since last Saturday, and creditors
are worrying. Woolsey's disappearance
and attachments levied on the property

There have been rumors for several
weeks that all was not as It should be
with the Woolsey Implement' Company.
It was reported that the manager was
selling vehicles lower than the firm could
afford to do, and that the bills against
the firm were not being paid as promptly
as they had been in times gone by.' Last

PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 14.â Mounted on
a bicycle a daring thief yesterday suc
ceeded in robbing Miss Lena Hadaway, a
school teacher, of J03 and a pocketbook,
and Mrs. E. T. Howe of a purse contain
ing $15. He turned the tricks while riding
rapidly, and before his victims could re
cover from their surprise and act he was
out of sight.
The method of the thief is new in Port
land, and each of the victims could
scarcely believe she had been robbed. The
women at first thought the rider had ac
cidentally come bo close to them that his
handlebars caught their purse strings,
but upon reflection decided they had been
cleverly dispossessed of their money.
Miss Hadaway was robbed of her entire
faJary for the previous month. She was
walking down, the street, when the robber
approached from the rear. She heard the
wheel coming, but paid no heed. A3 he
passed her he grasped her purse, break-

"Last May I was so run down I only
weighed 111 pounds, and I realized that I
must 6top smokier, and stuck to it for
about ten days, but was so nervous and
out of oorts my family told me I had bet-
ter ro back to smoking. aÂ» it was Impos-
sible to live with me. It was just about
this lirae rny wife brought a package of
Grape-Nut 8 on the table one morning,
and as I could eat nothing else ehe in-
duced rr,o to try a little of that. So I took
a teaEpoonful of it, and, strange to say.
It tasted good, and by .the time I had it
down I knew it had gone to the right
ei;ot. so I took some more, and it was the
.fiist food I had relished for weeks.
"So I kept up the use of Grape-Nuts,
fci.d as my appetite came back added other
foods, and I am now back to my old
weight of 1S3 pounds, never felt better In
xry We and. strange as it may eeem, I
have no further craving for the tobacco,
end I thoroughly believe that only the
courage and ambition I got out of the
food Grape-Nuts has . given me the
Ftrength to <;qU smoking. If every one
knew the power of this wonderful food
you would not be able to build a factory-
big enough to supply it" Name given

had tried many times to break off from

Improper food creates abnormal tastes,
and there are many cases on the medical
records where the licfuor habit and tobac-

IF it be true that our new million-dollar hospital, for
which bonds were voted, was planned for location on
the Almshouse grounds, now found to be too remote
and entirely unsuitcd, and that a change of location invali
dates the bonds, we have an example of too much baste in
the preparation of the bond proposition and an instance of
immaturity of judgment that will provoke the people. s * "*
Perhaps the new hospital is, next to the sewers, the most
necessary of all the objects of the bond issue. It seems to be
established, b.y the expression of competent engineers, that
the sewer plans are defective and that there is great danger
that the proceeds of the' bonds for that purpose will -be
wasted. With the discovery that the hospital bonds are also
in danger the people will have little cause for pride in, the
skill and precision with which j these weighty matters are
handled by their, local government.
, The new city and county hospital should be one of the
finest in the United States. The money voted for it is am

The formulary . also Includes remedies
for delirium tremens and a disinfectant
for telephone receivers.
According to Dr. W. E. Dreyfus, chief
chemist of the department of public chari
ties and Bellevue Hospital In New York,
the day for razors Is past.
Dr. Dreyfus has finished his prepara
tion of the hospital formulary, which Is
said to be one of the most complete and
extensive In the world. -It is used as a
basis every year for the national formu
lary issued by the American Pharmaceu
tical Association. ! This year the formu
lary contains 3S7 formulas, among them
being some that are unique.
One of them is a formula that consists
of several Ingredients that are to be made
up into a paste. According to the chem
iKt, by allowing the paste to remain on
th* face for about two minutes It will
give a result similar to that of a "clean
shave." The formula Is as follows: 1
Barl! sulphldl, 25 parts.
Baponis pulvls. 5 parts.
Talcl venetl pulvls, 35 parts.
Trttid farinae, 33 parts.
Benzaldehyde, quarter solution.

The doomed man had looked up only In
time to see the monster enter the cage.
The tiger trap was a huge wooden cage
built along this same HnÂ©. The bait was
to be agoat, hung up in the cage's center
by the hind leg. The sound of its bleat
ing was expected to draw the "Striped
Death" to the rpot The cage had been
strapped together in haste and I doubted
Its strength. Ghur.ga, however, who had
built it. assured me that it was strong
enoHgrfc t*Â» frold any tiger. We went to in-
Frxsct it at noontide, meaning to hang thÂ©
jroat In it at dusk, and to wait near for
thÂ© sound that should tell us the door had
fallen shut with the "Striped Death" safe
In the cape.
We had set up the trap in a small clear
injr In the jungle. I still doubted its
Ftrength, so Ghunga (after fastening the
door open) stepped inside and set to
work rendering the willowy bars more
firm In their sockets.
Then, like a thunderclap out of a clear
eky, came the tragedy. â A gleam of taw
ny fur shot from the Impenetrable shad
ows at the side of the Jungle farthest
from ns. Before either Remachunda or
myself could spring to our feet the "Strip
ed Death" had reached the door of the
cage, rushed fearlessly through the prop
p*dr open door and fallen upon Ghunga
Dhass.
There, one day. in the jungle, we eet up
a great trap. It was, roughly speaking
on somewhat the same plan as the mouse
trap wherein hans^? a bait to tempt the
mouse to enter. No sooner does the
mouse** weight press on the floor of the
trap than the door springs shut, leavine
him a prisoner.
For two weeks we worked In vain
Traps, falls and all other sorts of cus
tomary ruses were useless. The brute
pee.mcd. Indeed, to have some of the mir
aculous powers attributed to him by the
superstitious villagers. At last even the
iron nerves of my two intrepid shikarrU
werÂ© almost shaken by the tiger's re
peated escapes from the situations where
in Jt seemed there was no loophole left
ThÂ© "Striped Death" had last been seen
about twenty miles to the north of Rem
achunda's village, where he had slain
sntj partly devoured a half grown goat
herd. Thither we went, acting on the
theory that a tiger thoroughly exhausts
the possibilities O f cne neighborhood be
fore moving on to another.
I convinced him Foon that the profits
would warrant the extra toll and we set
to work on our plans.
"Sahib." said Ghunga, "to shoot a tiger
is easy if one bÂ© brave ar.d wise. To en
mesh him sJlve is like trapping the light
ning. It Is perilous and unprofitable."
Next morning I left Calcutta. I went
Firalght to the village, where dwelt an
old. scarred native hunter of my ac
quaintance, Remachunda Dhass by name.
He and his younger brother. Ghunga
Dhas?. were noted "ehlkarrls" (hunts
men), and feared nothing. By their help I
believed I could do more toward captur
ing thÂ« "Striped Death" than with a
whole regiment of beaters.
I explained my business to the brothers.
When I named the price they were eager
to start at once on the hunt. But when
I stipulated that the ti^er must be caught
alive and unhurt their faces fell.
. It was not only the desire for sport that
spurred me on to this. I had but that day
fcund awaiting me at Calcutta a letter
from a famous European animal dealer
who wanted a large male tiger and who
commissioned mÂ«Â» to 'procure such a one
for him if possible.
These two motives urged me to the
quest.
This was the Etate of affairs when I
reached Calcutta. This was the story
that reawoke In me the hunting fever.
I thought the matter over for a while
th<=n I said to my Informant:
"I don't want to boast, but I think I can
gret this 'Striped Death* of yours. I mean
to have a try at him anyhow."
In a big, heavily barred window at 501
Broadway, New York, during the recent
municipal campaign, a huge tiger paced
back and forth. He was said to be the
largest end finest specimen of his kind in
captivity.
The Order of Acorns had "leased" him
fcr the campaign, as an anti-Tammany
warning, emblematic of the caging of the
Tammany tiger. In front of the window
hung the following placard:
: DO YOU WANT TO TURN HIM :
; LOOSE AGAIN? :
: ITS UP TO YOU! :
Now I, for one, had not the faintest, re
motest desire to "turn him loose again."
For I helped to capture him, and I never
could look on those mighty paws of his
without Fceming to see them, as I had
once before eeen them, stained with hu
man blood.
â¢ â¢ â¢
A year ago last September I returned to
Calcutta from an "up-country" big game
expedition. At my club there "on the even
ing of my arrival I picked up a story that
awoke in me the old hunting instinct,
which is never very soundly asleep in the
heart of a man who has once seen
gigantic beasts fall dead at the light pres
sure of his forefinger on the trigger.
The story in brief was this:
Vor severaJ years the Calcutta district
had been terrorized by a tremendous man
eating tiger. Now whenever a tiger has
killed a tingle human being- the gentle
native always begins to describe the brute
as being several sizes larger than an ele
phant, and tells how he can swallow three
men at a mouthful. So the t'ger stories
gleaned from natives must always be
taken with at least a bushel of ealt. But
tne rumors concerning this particular
tigerâ "The Striped Death." as the vil
lagers had nickniimed himâ were persist
ent and were more than once verified by
l^nclish hunters who had come upon his
human "kills." Several hunting parties
hp.d gone in search of him, but he was
as wily as he was terrible. Lord Curzon.
the Viceroy, had even gpt up a Epecial
hunt, with the "Striked Death" as its
object. But. though many tigers fell prey
to the expedition, the tiger they wanted
was not among the slain.
After this the natives declared that a
tiger which could elude the "divine vice
roy" must be a supernatural being. No
sexoner was this rumor started than it of
curse becam* Impossible to hire "beat
ers" to hunt him. No native would will
ingly face the wrath of the particular
pod or demon who had chosen that tiger's
bedy as his headquarters.

Says a London newspaper: "Perhaps the
greatest tribute ever paid to the Mexican
President was that which hÂ© received
from Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes and some of
his African friends once formed a syndi
cate, representing about Â£10.000.000 of cap
ital, with a view of exploiting Mexican
resources. They sent several experts to
the- country to investigate matters, and
having received their reports decided to
enter into no Mexican adventures. Cecil
Rhodes was asked why he held back and
what was his opinion of the prospects of
Mexico. His answer was: There 13 no
guarantee that when President Diaz dies
Mexico will have any better government
than that which prevails in the other
Central American republics.' "

"The plan was carried out and as soon

A partial rebuilding of the tabernacle
is under contemplation by the first presi
dency of the Mormon church. It is pro
posed to put a new roof on the historic
structure that has been the meeting place
of hundreds of thousands of devout ad
herents of the faith and the object of cu
rious observance on the part of many
hundreds "of thousands of visitors.
Architects sav that the wooden trusses
that support the structure are beginning
to be affected by dry rot, and that the
best way to remedy the defect and put
the tabernacle into an absolutely safe
condition is to put in steel supports In
the place of thÂ© wooden arches which
now support the roof.
When the tabernacle was built. In the
sixties, nails cost such a high price that
the Immense timbers were fastened with
thongs made of deer hide to save expense.
These great pieces of wood have been in
place since 1S67 without a change, the
building having been In course of con
struction from 1S64 to 1S67. In the time
of President Wilford Woodruff the. re
building of the tabernacle was first agi
tated, and Architect Don Carlos Young
was asked to submit plans for the change.
Nothing waa done at that time.
Since then the subject has been taken
up from time to time without results,
and now. under the regime of President
Joseph F. Smith, it is again under fa
vorable consideration. There is a strong
prospect, it is stated, that the improve
ment will be ordered.

for wood In the roof, which will not affect

so bad now as they once were. It says:
"Those who sigh for the weather of
former times may be told by the author
ity of 'The Picture of London for 1819'
that there were then about 203 days In the
year without rain, and 156 on which It
rained or snowed. But of the 203 rainless
days there were between fifty and sixty
on which the sun scarcely showed Itself
to Londoners. At the same time the aver
age annual depth of rain was only nine
teen Inches. The coldest day recalled by
the people of that period was Christmas
day, 173t>. when the Fahrenheit thermom
eter had indicated 34 degrees below freez
ing point, and'the hottest days were some
in July, 1S08, when the thermometer stood
in the shade at from 90 to 103, and In the
sun from 120 to 110 degrees."
Investigation has demonstrated that the responsibility for
the Wyoming Indian outrages rests upon the white offi
cials, whose indiscretions, injustices and tyranny drove the
red men in desperation to revolt. This information is in
teresting simply because it is unusual. It is one of those
isolated cases where the truth is told in reference to the
treatment of Indians by Americans.

"You have heard that . story of the

the old engineer. "Well, I can beat that

'"Years ago I used to have the run be
tween Hawthorne and Keeler on the Car
son and Colorado Railroad over In Ne
vada. You know that is the road about
which D. O. Mills made the remark that
it was three hundred miles too long and
built three hundred years too soon. I
guess that was about right, for the trains
are run when they happen to have any
passengers and on no time at all.
"We left Hawthorne on time one morn
ing. The day was a scorcher. That little
locomotive seemed like old hell itself.
After we leave Candelarla the grade com

ing train, preferring the heat of the day
to tho Increased temperature of the en

"Between Basalt and Summit the road
Is full of curves. We were out on the
ground this day and peacefully strolling
beside the puffing engine. Pete, the fire
man, called my attention to a peculiar
rock formation to the right of the road

note our absence, struck a level stretch

either the brakeman or conductor. I had
one resort left: it waa to run across a

away on the up . grade again. Out of
breath I struck the track again. About
five hundred yards down the rails was my

She had run short of steam or I never
would have caught her. I brought her to

NOTWITHSTANDING the solemn assurance of Solo
mon that there is nothing new under the sun the
credible columns of the Redding Free Press contain
an account of a project in which Shasta County women arc
engaged having a claim to novelty and that will appeal to
the fancy of frugal housewives throughout the length and
breadth of California.
The Presbyterian church in Redding has a woman's aux
iliary which provides the funds to meet the current expenses
of the church.. The women, in fact, are a ways and means
committee. They have been energetic and faithful to their
self-imposed trust. Recently a discussion took place con
cerning the best way to raise needed funds and out of the
discussion came the new thing.
The decision of the women is that they will hold monthly
"sociables." These will take place in rotation at the homes
of. the members. Heretofore the hostess has provided the
luncheon and the house for the entertainment of her asso
ciates in the church work. But now a plan has been adopted
upon which the attention of many women is firmly centered.
A lunch and a social committee has been appointed." The
duty of the first named committee is to supply the luncheon.
However numerous may be those who sit at table at the
monthly gatherings, an inflexible rule, adopted by vote,
limits the amount of money to be expended in total to just
one and a half dollars. The members have determined to
enter into competition to see who can put up the best lunch
eon for the entire auxiliary for that modest sum.
The Redding Free Press makes the assertion that there
are seventy-five members of the Woman's Auxiliary. If
they all attend the "sociables," as they are likely to do with
such a series of culinary contests on hand as are promised
by resolution, the average cost of refreshments per woman
cannot exceed 2 cents. Probably there will not be many
courses at that rate. Labor in preparing the meals must be
eliminated from the expense of preparation. Not necessarily
will there be an absence- of dessert, for clever California
housewives have the knack of "putting up" berries and fruits
and these may be utilized in various ways.
: Light. tea biscuits there will be, as flaky and white as the
snows "that glisten daily on the visible and not distant sum
mit, of lofty Mount Shasta. Butter made at home by the
fair matrons of Shasta County will grace the board. The
fragrant? steam of good coffee may even perfume the cir
cumambient atmosphere. Great will be the triumph of in
genuity and practical housekeeping when the climacteric of
these economical luncheons shall be reached. The idea is
as taking as new. It may figure elsewhere. Redding leads
the way..: â¢
Â¦The promise of Charles Becker, the most infamous and
the* most clever of forgers, that he intends to, earn an hon
est living seems likely of realization. He intends to demand
the thousand dollars reward offered by a corporation to any
person who could alter the figures made, by a patented check
perforating machine. Becker did the trick and.paid several
years of imprisonment in penalty. His nerve appears now
to be equal to his craft.

they make 41-callber guns, which Is trust
worthy, and 38-callber guns, which will
pass. Even a 32-caliber gun In a 44 frame

"Now here I have a 44-callber pineapple
and a 22-caliber prickly pear, but both of
them guns, and if I can cross the prickly
pear with the pineapple or vlcy versy I
may get a 41-caliber pineapple or a* 3S-cali

Three Times and Out.
"There Is a well-known lawyer In this
city, one who Is at the head of his pro
fession," said a former Superior Judge
the other day, "who was admitted to
practice only after he had been up for
examination as to his fitness three dif
ferent times. He was so pleased with the
success of his third attempt that he felt
he must in some way show his gratitude
to the examining Justice. Accordingly he
waited until colirt adjourned and then
went to the latter's chambers. He was
preparing to leave after giving- his thanks
when the Supreme Judge asked tTie
young barrister to convey his regards to
his father, ut that time a brilliant law
yer.
" 'Certainly.* said the young attorney.
'It was only this morning that father was
speaking of you.- In fact, the little con
versation I had with him concerning the
court and yourself had a great deal to
do with my success to-day.*
" 'Is that so?* asked the Justice. In
what way may I ask?' Â¦
" 'Well,* jsaid the disciple of Black
stone, 'he told me I would surely pass
to-day, and when I asked him what made
him think so he said that the Supreme

IN behalf of Lemon Cove the Visalia Times claims the
.banner for sending the earliest carload of oranges out
of the State this season. Heretofore the fame of Lemon
Cove has rested on its capacity for producing lemons, which
fact -is -advertised by its name. But now that favored, sec
tion of Tulare County, as it is described by the Times, "will
be at the' front for its oranges." The reward that generally
attends the first carload of oranges is a fancy price.
Incidental to its congratulations < for Lemon Cove the
Visalia Times tells of the advancement of- the citrus fruit
industry in several parts of Tulare County. The orange crop
of this season in the county is larger than ordinary, but the
ripening r has been delayed. : "The fruit, is perfectly sweet,
but during the past month has put on very little of the
golden color."
"This is the season of the year when it is a delight to
travel through the citrus sections of the county.. At-Por
tcrville many young groves were planted last spring. The
older groves near Porterville have heavy crops. At Lind
say the acreage in oranges has been considerably extended.
The older groves" are heavily fruited and the same may be
said of those around Exeter and Antelope Heights.. The
trees planted this year at Exeter, Antelope Heights, Lemon
Cove and Colvins Point are looking thrifty, arid there is
every, reason to expect that they will be as good producers
as are found in the old groves that have made the county
famous.'V V;-: "Â¦'
The attentive observer will notice that the orange groves
of the land north of Tehachapi arc becoming numerous.
There is .a citrus fruit belt that runs the entire length of
the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys, including" many
choice, foothill Â¦ locations. At the time of holding the
Thanksgiving Citrus Fair in this city there were represented
in the show many counties north of Tehachapi's summit. >
Placer County, in the foothills of the Sierra, claims the
honor of entering the'San Francisco market the earliest this
season, with its oranges.. The date upon which. Lemon
Cove forwarded its first carload of oranges in 1903 to the
East was October 25. The first oranges to reach this city
of the new crop of 1003 were six boxes from Auburn. They
arrived; here October 15. Tulare's claim to being the first
to; reach" the Eastern market in 1903 may be shown to be
valid! . ',
Â¦ The ; saloon men of . New York have raised a subscrip

From this sketch the reader will gather that the republic
of Panama fulfills conditions that were regarded as desirable
but impossible in 1846; that its Government is de. facto and
has been recognized by President Roosevelt under the prin
ciple laid down by Monroe; that we have interests on the
isthmus under our treaty obligations which we must not, ac
cording to the same authority, permit Colombia to injure.
He then. discussed the guarantee of sovereignty and-de
clared that its necessity arose in the sparse population of
the isthmus* being insufficient in numbers and power to erect
and maintain an independent and neutral state. Some civil
government must exist there, because "Neither sovereign
states nor individuals would expend their capital in railroad
or canal construction without some security for their invest
ments, and a civil government must exist there in order to
protect the works that shall be constructed. If Great
Britain, France or the. United States held the sovereignty
over the isthmus other nations might apprehend that in case
of war the Government would close up the passage against
the enemy, but New Granada is a power which wiU not ex
cite the jealousy of any nation."
There is a complete disclosure of the purpose of the treat}'
and of its several guarantees. We did not undertake to per
petuate any special sovereignty over the isthmus, but only to
guarantee that it should be local and not alien. It. is ob
vious that President Polk ha'd considered the advantage of
a purely isthmian state, for he admitted its impossibility at
that time because the isthmus had but few people. Now it
is the sixth state in the republic in population, and in com
merce and enterprise ranks first of them all. Geographi
cally Colombia is a South American state, a continental and
not a Central American country. Panama is the only Cen
tral American province. It is cut off from the rest of the
country by a natural boundary^of impassable mountains. It is
by nature isolated from the other eight provinces. No doubt
the advantages of its geographical situation occurred to Polk,
and no doubt he considered the desirability of a strictly
isthmian state, but was compelled to put the hope aside be
cause the people were so few in number. Time and com
merce have changed all this and have formed the elements
of an isthmian state, able to take from Colombia, as she took
from New Granada, the obligations of the treaty of 1846 and,
execute them. Panama has issued into being as the result
of a revolution, as did Bolivar's original state of Colombia,
and its successor, New Granada, and Colombia again. We
recognized them in turn as Governments de facto and de
jure, as we have recognized the latest heir to their sover
eignty and muniments.
In Iris seventh annual message President Monroe,; who
had discussed the revolt of the Spanish colonies and thc
prevalcncc of revolution in Europe, said: "Our policy is to
consider the dc facto Government as the legitimate Govern
ment for us; to cultivate friendly relations with it and to
preserve those relations by a frank, firm and manly policy,
meeting in all instances the just claims of every po.wcr, sub
mitting to injuries from none."
IT is reported, from Bogota that President Marroquin will
take steps to compel the United States to observe its
guarantee of the sovereignty of Colombia, assumed by
the treaty of 1846. One is at a loss to know what that
means., The treaty of 1846 was made with the republic of
New Granada. That state was a constant scene of seething
contentions, civil wars and riots, and finally was overthrown"
and a revolutionary junta proclaimed the republic of Colom
bia. If there were any guarantee of sovereignty in the
treaty made with New Granada in 1846 it obligates us to
contest now the sovereignty of the state of Colombia, once
the soil that belonged to New Granada.
As the Panama matter is likely to assume the greatest im
portance that has attached to anything relating to Latin-
America since the declaration of the Monroe doctrine and
is quite apt to figure Extensively in the Presidential cam
paign of next year, it is well to examine the clauses of the
treaty that will figure in the discussion. The whole issue' is
included in the thirty-fifth article, which contains .the reason
and real and whole object of the treaty. By it New Granada
agreed that "The right of way or transit across the isthmus
of Panama upon any modes of communication that now ex
ist or may be hereafter constructed shall be open and free
to the Government and citizens of the United States," and
"the United States guaranty, positively and efficaciously, to
New Granada by the present stipulation the perfect neutral
ity of the before mentioned isthmus, with the view that the
free transit from the one to the other sea may not be inter
rupted or embarrassed in any future time while this treaty
exists; and in consequence the United States also guaranty
in the same manner the rights of sovereignty and property
which New Granada has and possesses over said territory."
The rest of the very long document is inconsequential,
being merely the husk, while article 35 is the kernel. If we
undertook to guarantee the permanent sovereignty of New
Granada over the isthmus we failed in our obligation when
that sovereignty passed to Colombia. A fair interpretation
of the language is that the treaty runs with the land and we
agree to respect whatever political sovereignty holds the
land. .
The treaty was made by Benjamin A. Bidlack on the part
of the United States and Senor Mallarino on the part of
New Granada. In transmitting it to the Senate for ratifica
tion President Polk justified our conclusion that article
35 was its motif. He said: "It will be perceived by the
thirty-fifth article of this treaty that New Granada proposes
to guarantee the right of passage across the isthmus of Pan
ama, over the natural roads and over any canal or railroad
that may be constructed, on condition that the United States
shall make a similar guarantee to New Granada of the neu
trality of this portion of her territory and her sovereignty
over the same. Our Charge d'Affaires acted in this matter
upon his own responsibility and without instructions. It
became my duty to decide whether I would submit the
treaty to the Senate and after mature deliberation I have de
termined to adopt this course."
At last the tiger gathered his bulk to
gether for a spring and launched him
self full at the cage. It rocked and
groaned at the impact, but stood firm.
Twice he leaped at the s.tout bars, driven
furious by the frightened cries of the
baby. Then he bit and tore at the wood
and tried to reach the prey with his
claws.
At last, failing in this, he began prowl-
Ing about the cage, looking for an open
ins. He came to the door. We held our
breath. Then we sighed with relief for
he had entered the trap, and the 'door
had cloFrd behind him. He did not note
the falling shut of the aoor, nor the strug
gling iamb that almost brushed his nose
as he passed. His only thought was of
the woman and child that now seemed
almost within his reach. Ho did not real
ize that he was trapped, but leaped mad
ly against the partition in a never end
ing struggle to break it down. That wom
an was the bravest I ever jrw, though
here was the courage of despair and re
venge.
The moment the trap was sprung we
had descended from -the tree.'. A tew
blows of Remachunda's ax made an open
ing In the trap large enough for the
mother and child to creep through.
Then, cunningly and deftly, Remachun
da began to pass 'a hide rope' about the
tiger's wildly struggling body, throug*n
the bars. In half an hour the "Striped
Death" waa bound, enmeshed and help
less.
It had been the. most exciting . night's
work of my career as a hunter.
â¢ â¢ â¢
That night the moon rose over the
Jungle clearing and illumined a strange
sightâ the huge trap, with open door; the
body of a live lamb dangling just within
near the doorway, and farther back in a
sort of cage within a cage the form of a
woman, crouching on the floor, holding to
her breast a fretful baby and soothing its
cries with no more fear in her voice than
If she were safe in her husband's hut.
From a tree top fifty feet away we
watched, silent yet alert, for every sound
that the Jungle breeze bore to us. For
two hours we all waited thus. The
strange, unaccountable noises that run
through the jungle at night now rose,
now fell, as the time wore on. The dis
tant howl of some animal, the nearer pat
ter of feet, the Ecreani of night birds
and at last
There he stood, the "Striped Death." in
the moonlit clearing not 100 feet from the
trap. Each detail of his massive bÂ»dy
stood out clear and distinct. At sight of
the trap and its human bait (which he
had doubtless tracked for miles by scent
and Bound) he flattened himself to the
ground like a cat.ran forward a few steps,
flattened himself once more, and again ran
on. The woman saw him. but not for a
moment did she intermit the crooninjt
lullaby. .
â¢Listen, sahib," she added, turning to
me, "the 'Striped Death' must be caught,
not slain. That would release the spirit
within him. Let him be made captive and
grinned at by the curious in a cage. That
will break his heart and shame his spirit.
That is more than death to such . as he.
Now it is my right as next of kin to catch
him. Do you know why he will not con
sent to enter your traps? It Is because
they are baited with beasts, and he
craves human flesh. It is not that he
fears a trap. He entered when my hus
band was the bait. But he cares not for
beasts. Let the trap be baited with hu
man flesh." x
And then she unfolded her plan. The
trap was to be further strengthened, then
a partition was to be fastened midway
across it. On the side nearest the open
door a lamb was to be hung. Oh the op
posite side she, the widow, was to sit with
her child in her arms. The tiger, enter-
Ing the trap to seize the human bait,
would be caught by the springing of the
door.
There was no real danger to her, as she
would be safely barred from him in the
other. half of the cage. But the idea
seemed so horrible that I shrank from it.
She was determined, however, and at last
Remachunda yielded.
The village wept over the dead man. All
except his wife. She was a beautiful na
tive woman and had adored her hunter
husband. Yet she sat dry-eyed, clasping
to her breast their three-months-old baby.
"It will be time to weep when his slayer
is captured," the said in reply to a query
from Remachunda.
All this had not. taken more than one
second. The tiger sank his teeth In the
dead man's shoulder and lifted him from
the ground, turning to leave the trap as
he did so.
Remachunda rushed forward toward the
rifle, yelling as he came. I drew my re
volver and fired point blank once, twice,
thrice at the tiger. At that range there
was no such thing as missing. But, un
fortunately, with a light caliber pistol
there was no such thing as killing. Yet
our combined attack had Its effect. With
a growl the brute dro ped Ghunga Dhass
and at one spring was back in the jungle.
Remachunda, unmindful of my former
order not to kill, ran into the jungle after
the slayer, rifle in hand. An hour later
he returned, baffled.
His rifle (the only one we had brought
along that day) lay just outside the trap.
It might as well have been a thousaul
miles away for all the use it was to any
of us three at that awful crisis, when
events traveled by fractions of a second.
Ghunga. hero that he was, hurled the
heavy hammer he was using straight at
the hideous, wrinkled face of the crea
ture. The hammer must have weighed
several pounds. It was hurled by a pow
erful man, to whom despair had lent an
added strength. It struck the tiger al
most midway between the eyes. Such a
blow w<juld have stunned an ox or have
killed & man. The "Striped Death" heed

If these things were not duly considered before the bonds
were called for some one has grievously blundered. The
people want exactness, not hurry, in these important mat
ters, and as our public officers seem to be amply paid for the

One of the bright â¢. remarks | of Law
rence Barrett, and one that will- be re
called as long as the stage anecdote is
popular, was that which* he made to an
earnest but somewhat inartistic young
amateur who was a, member of his com
pany. â¢
The 'actor In question is well known to
day and ranks well with the best leading
men of the country. At that time, how
ever, he had not developed the ability
which he now has, and in:" Julius Caesar 1 '
appeared In one ' of Â¦ the scenes ' in' a' white
toga, bordered with red. He had -wound
this about himself most artistically un
til he resembled an animated stick of
utrlped red and white candy. However,
a very different comparison waa suggest-.
ed to the mind of Barrett, the star,- as he
beheld the toga-swathed Â¦; beginder. $
soon as he could get across the, stage in
the vicinity of the young actor and during
the , rendition of the lines of another
principal, -he exclaimed angrily In a loud
whieper:
"For heaven's sake;" get 'off .'the stage
get off the stage!. -You.* look like. a' sore,
finger!"â St. Louis Republic.
Barrett's Observation.
Seldom are we completely happy. When
we think we are there comes a gnawing
knowledge that our Joy cannot last
Germany owns 10.220 miles of tele
trraph cables, or one-twenty-foarth of
the entire system of the world, while
Oreat Britain owns two-thirds of the
total mileage.
Censure from friends and praise from
our enemies are . tho best guides to our
actual condition. t
Some surprising and noteworthy conclu
sions on this point have been reached by
a German naturalist. Werner of Vienna,
who has recently reported the results of
observations that he has been making for
some time on the senses of inferior ver
tebrates. Says the Revue Scientiflquo in
noting these results:
On certain points the conclusions of M.
Werner, are very surprising, and in all
they are worthy of notice. . Werner has
observed 136 individuals, of which one
third were at liberty, and he took all pos
sible, precautions not to let the creatures
know that , they were watched. One gen
eral fact is very evident that reptiles and
amphibians are strongly attracted by
water. They go straight for it, even when
they are at distances' so great that they
could not divine its presence, by -any of
the senses known to us. It seems 'Â¦ really
that a sense of which we have no knowl
edge informs them , of the direction in
which water may be found.
There seems ; to be a sort of . chemical
attraction, says ; M. Werner. But ; how
does this r act, arid on what ; part j of the
creature? This remain's a mystery. \Rep
tiles also seek the light, but independent
ly of heat; they are positively hellotropic,'
and In winter they of ten leave a comfort
able and warm retreat , to seek the sun
light. Sight 1b generally good with . them.
It is probably the finest sense that they
possess, ; but . it would still appear to be
very limited. The caymans and the croc
odiles cannot distinguish a man at a dis
tance of more than six times their length,
according to Werner. In the water fishes
see only ; at very, close rangeâ about half
their own length, i This will seem, per
hapg,"". unlikely : to Â¦Â¦Â¦ anglers, although some
of . them can K cite Instances showing that
fish cannot'see far.: Snakes seem. to have
a very mediocre sense of sight. The boa,
f or '.: instance,; does I not | see at more than
aVquarter Â¦Â¦ or a third â¢ of ' its own â¢ length;
different species^ arc limited to one-fifth
or one-eighth? of their length.' Frogs are
better, off. They see at fifteen or twenty,
times, their, length. -Frog 'catchers' know
this from experience. .'
: Hearing ? Is i much 'i poorer than } sight. â¢ if
possible. Most reptiles are noticeably deaf,,
except caymans, and crocodiles; ;."the boa

According to reports from Europe the
spread of Esperanto, the language in
vented for universal use, has proved of
value to Esperantlsts. At a recent gath
ering In London one of the guests brought
with him a' French gentleman and his
wife and a Czech from Bohemia. None of
the three could speak a word of English,
but Esperanto was found to be a per
fectly facile medium for conversation.
The Bohemian gentleman had had various
amusing experiences while journeying
through Europe. He had taken one of the
Esperanto journals, marked the names of
the secretaries of , the various groups in
tho foreign towns through which he had
to pass, and so, not knowing anything of
the . languages, he; had traveled through
several continental, countries, seeing all
that was to be seen with the help of
various Esperanto friends, and finally ar
rived - In England. He knocked jut the
door of a London Esperantist, who came
down to interview the stranger and
found that he needed a home while in
London, but did not know where to go,
as no one could understand ' him. There
was no difficulty, as both could communi
cate in Esperanto. â Chicago News.
The Spread of "Esperanto."
"But it seems reasonable that there
should be laws, and those laws rigidly
enforced against the practice. The pub
lic maintains criminal courts at enormous
expense to punish crimes, the majority of
which, without doubt, are committed
with revolvers. If it were hard for folks
to get pistols the expense of the criminal
courts would be cut down materiallyâ to
say nothing of the gain in the way of de
creased trouble 'and grief in the world. '
"Of course the effects of such laws
would be plow at first, because of, the
countless number of revolvers scattered
about the country. But as time and con
fiscation - made these - weapons useless
there inevitably would be a heavy falling
off in the number of murders. It ought
to be more, difficult for a man to buy a re
volver than to buy, strichnine. Murder
with strychnine must -necessarily be pre
meditated, while murder Â¦ with , a , revolver
can come on the instant and leave ever
lasting remorse behind.
"Walking the streets of many large cit
ies to-day are thousands of reckless and
quick-tempered youths who have loaded
revolvers in their pockets. There Is no
reason why they should be allowed to
have these instruments of death. We
have overlooked" the remedy too long."â
Washington Star, r ' ;Â¦ .;
"Some one has advanced the argument
in favor of the aale of deadly weapons
that the constitution of the United States
gives the right to bear arms. Maybe this
is good logic If so, then we should sub
side.
l "In these glorious days of liberty every
body down to the email boy ni&y delight

"It Is tolerably hard to buy poison with
which to kill our enemies, for druggists
nowadays are inclined to be curious, but

PARIS, Nov. 14.â It was learned to-day
from a trustworthy source that Japan is
dissatisfied with the progress of negotia
tions between that country and Russia.
The Japanese Parliament will, meet on
December 6,' and the Government | of Ja
pan desires to be able to report that it
has reached an agreement with Russia,
as otherwise the opposition party is cer
tain to attack the Ministry violently,'de
mand war with Russia and inflame pub
lic sentiment to the war. point. It is
pointed out j that negotiations nave
dragged recently, especially while the
Czar and his Foreign Minister,: Count
Lomsdorff, were absent from .Russia.
Baron de Rosen, the Russian Minister in
Toklo, represented that nothing could be
obtained while they were away.
The Japanese claim Russian j tactics
have been dilatory throughout. They point
out that Japan first broached the sub
ject -of the Manchurian convention, and
that when Russia did not fulfill her. pledge
to evacuate the second province of Man
churia, Russia suggested that the nego
tiations be deferred until Lessar, the Rus
sian Minister to China, who was on leave
of absence, returned to Peking., Then Ja
pan renewed her overtureSf and Russia
proposed a further delay until the Russian
"War Minister, General Kuropatkln, had
returned from his visit to Japan. - i The
Japanese consequently expressed the opin
ion that the object of Russian policy had
been to gain time to reinforce the army
and navy of Russia in the Far East so
that she might be prepared for possible
war.

The retirement of Professor Syle from
the faculty of the University of Callforr
nla about a year ago came with an ab
ruptness that was in its method consid
ered coercion at the hands of the regents
and Is deemed by many to have been due
to the differences between Professor Syle
and Professor Charles Mills Gayley, head
of the English department. President
Wheeler took a hand in the controversy
and is said to have taken sides with Gay
.ley in forcing the retirement. Although
he rarely spoke of his tnuble Syle 'was
attacked with spells of melancholia,

ment at a sanitarium. Lately he has
been living at 577 Twelfth street in this

Irofessor Syle was born In British In
dia and was 45 years of age. His father
was an Episcopal clergyman and a chap
lain In the British army. When young
Syle was a mere lad the family moved to
this country and ' Syle entered Yale and
graduated with the degree of M./A. '

His ideals were far beyond what \. the
many attain to and it was this that made
his dramatic criticism in the dailies too
severe to become popular with the peo
ple whose art-was his passion, and the
commercial value of his work in this line
was a failure.
Keen and bright, his analyses and crit
icisms in the classroom were a constant
inspiration to those who listened to his
lectures. He would endeavor to thin out
his classes at the beginning of each term
by an exaggerated picture of the hard
work ahead of those entering for the
work. This was done so thafonly those
would remain that were earnestly seek
ing their own improvement, and to these
he gave the best that lay in his power. *
Professor Syle was a man of rare lit
erary attainments and had established
for himself an enviable and world wide
reputation, both as an author and a dra
matic critic. He made English literature
his special study and Sis connection with
the university was a recognition
of his ability. He wrote a book on the
drama and did some dramatic criticism
and special writing for the newspapers,
but it is not through these that he will
be remembered by the many with whom
he came in contact.
months, his death came as a sur
prise and he leaves a wife' and daughter

this morning and the exertion evidently
overtaxed his strength and stilled the
beating of his heart
The funeral arrangements have not
been completed, but the services will be
held next Tuesday morning at 10:30
o'clock. Professor Syle was for many
years connected witl* the University of
California and will be remembered
throughout the length and breadth of Cal
ifornia by hundreds to whom he en
deared himself in the course of his in
struction. While , somewhat brusque In
his manner and cutting and sarcastic in
his speech In the classroom, those who
penetrated this exterior found a friend

The cases were continued till Wednes
day to enable the District Attorney to
file an answer to the affidavits. He says
there Is r.o necessity for him to file an
answer, the proceedings before a Grand
Jury being secret, as decided both by the
Supreme Court and the Federal court.
Topping in his affidavit averred that
whiie he was testifying before the Grand
Jury the District Attorney had remarked:
"If you were in a criminal court maybe
three or four days in the County Jail
would cause you to answer more rap
idly." The District Attorney had also re
marked to the witness, "Are you dull or
dishonest?*'
In his affidavit the defendant averred
that he had been served with a subpena
and compelled to testify against his will
before the Grand Jury; that he had not
been informed that he was to be sworn
or investigated In any matter concerning
himself or any of his acts or doings; that
he had been asked questions and had an
swered some, but refused to answer oth
ers, as it might incriminate him, and he
was not compelled to be a witness in any
< riminal proceeding against himself; that
all the papers, documents and books of
the firm had been taken possession of by
Henry Wadsworth, the receiver appointed
by the United States District Court in the
bankruptcy proceedings, against the de
sire of the defendant, and Wadsworth
had appointed Arthur C. Platt and James
L. Fields to expert the books of the firm,
and they had testified before the Grand
Jury against the protest of the defend
ant's counsel.
The first shot in the legal battle of the
people against Herman and Jacob Ep
pingcr of the bankrupt firm of Epplnger
& Co.. charged with obtaining money
by false pretenses, was fired by Attorneys
Ach and Dunne on behalf of the defend
ants in Judge Lawlor's court yesterday.
Tbe defendants were called upon to plead
end the!r attorneys promptly filed a mo
tion to quash the indictment against Her
man Eppingcr, which was accompanied
by alildavits by the defendant and W. W.
Topping, a former employe of the firm.
The. motion was made on the grounds
that the Indictment was not found nor in
dorsed nor presented as prescribed by the
Penal Code; that it had been based upon
illegal and Incompetent testimony received
by the Grand Jury; that the defendant,
against his will, was compelled to appear
before the Grand Jury and testify, and
that the District Attorney had been guilty
of improper .and Illegal conduct in con
ducting the investigation that resulted in
the Indictment:
Upson admitted that previous to calling
Drs. Preston and Reynolds to attend* his
wife he had given her morphine to allay
htr pains.
Upson further admitted that he had se
cured morphine tablets at the drug stores
of Olson at Geary and Mason streets and
Bayley at 251 Grant avenue, but he denied
that he had given his wife any morphine
after calling Dr. Preston to visit his wife
last Sunday. " '
Upson insisted that from the time he
called in Dr. Pres'ton last Sunday until
his wife died early Thursday morning
he only gave his wife the medicines
prescribed by Dr. Preston and Dr. Rey
nolds, who were called to see Mrs. Upson
a ipw hours before she died.
Both physicians have stated that they
did not prescribe any morphine for Mrs.
Upson. yet her death is.6upposcd to have
been caused by the administration of
morphine. The stomach of the dead wom
an and the medicines prescribed by the
doctors are now in the hands of the City
Chemist for analysis and the inquest wlil
not be held until the result of th& analy
sis is given to Coroner Leland.
Upson is well known to the police. HÂ«
was arrested a number of times for
printing bogus lottery tickets, but always
managed to escape conviction. Some
years ago he was arrested by the late
Chief of Police Lees on a charge of hav
ing dies for counterfeit money In his pos
session, but again escaped conviction.
If the result of 'the analysis of. the stom
ach of Mrs. Upson discloses that she died
from morphine poisoning and that the
medicines prescribed for her by the doc
tors who attended her did not contain
that drug. Upson will be subjected to an
other examination by the police and Cor
oner Leland.
Captain of Detectives Martin yesterday
secured a statement from Joseph F. Upson,
husband of Mrs.' Irene Upson, who died
early on Thursday morning last, presum
ably from morphine poisoning, under
mysterious circumstances.
Detective Ed Gibson secured the pres
ence of Upson at police headquarters and
the man was submitted to an examina
tion by Captain Martin and Detective
Gibson.

The same, laxity has been noticed In re

the respect that military discipline; calls

there has been too much familiarity. while
on duty between the rank and file and the
officers, the men presuming on personal

and addressing them, no*t by title, but by
their given names, as, for- instance, In

It is "Say, JlmV'^pr "Look here, Tom," all
of which is contrary to military etiquette.
POLITENESS DEMANDED.
There is some talk of usihg a portion
of , the State allowance for the purpose of
putting the quarters of the officers on
board of the Marion in first-class condi
tion.
Company D, San Rafael, Fifth Infan
try, and Captain Grattan's command of
the first battalion of artillery will meet
to-day at the San Rafael . target range
for the purpose of a contest at the three
distances. It is expected that ' it will be
a close match, as each organization has
many first-class shooters. :
The Musicians' Union, having decided
that members of the union may enlist in
the guard, . Captain Bauer of the ; Naval
Militia" is making arrangements to secure
a band for the battalion. V (
The uniform board of the guard Is pre
paring specifications in order to advertise
for bids for new r blouses and caps to
conform to those of the army of the
United States. As there is not money
enough in the fund, for want of a suf

I Colonel Hayes, commanding the Fifth
Infantry, visited " Company H . at Napa
last week. > This ia the company that
was severely criticized by Colonel* Kos
ter his recent report of Inspection.
The colonel i had a heart to heart -talk
with, the officers and men and gave them
to understand what Js wanted in order, to
redeem themselves and put the company
on '"its military feet again. ' Subsequently
the colonel was present at a meeting of
the city and county officials, attended also
by many leading citizens, and at this
meeting the possibility of the company's
being mustered out ' of the service was
discuss? d at length. I The expression of
the citizens was that ' they would do all
they Could to build up the company to
the end that it should not be disbanded.
LOOKING FOR BIDS.
Last Monday night Colonel Wilhelm,
United States army Inspector for the Na
tional Guard of ", California, paid a visit
to the 'Â¦ Ellis-street armory, where he ad
dressed the officers and members of the
First Battalion of Artillery. His remarks
teethe membership were 'in the nature of
a lecture on the -need of officers obtain
ing military knowledge. He said that it
is always ' the duty of the officers to fa
miliarize themselves with that which may
be of , the 'greatest benefit to themselves,
and to impart that knowledge to the men,
so that they may be able to use such
knowledge whenever the opportunity pre
sents itself. *
The officers,; he said, should acquire
knowledge about" the country In which
they are located, and particularly about
the section itt which their "organization is
located, to the end that they may know
how to defend any particular part of the
territory. They should become acquainted
with all methods of travel, railroads,
water r courses, country roads and even
trails, bo that If at any time they are
called upon to move they can do so with
out having to spend time consulting maps
and making Inquiry aa to the most "feasi
ble way to reach a certain point.? They
should have a good general Idea of- the
modes of transportation throughout the
State and, adjacent States, and this knowl
edge snould be Imparted to the men In
such a manner aa to give the information
that will enable them to act and know
where! to go. He spoke of the system In
the: various armies; he had visited, and
told of the manner in which the officers
secure Information and how they Impart
It to the men," also of the Information
they secure to protect various sections of
the territory from Invasion. He dwelt at
some length upon the completeness- of the
German system, which he declared Is onÂ©
of the best that can be devised. The
army of that nation, hÂ« said, Is thorough
ly Informed as to the military resources
of the country, | giving it a decided ad
vantage over armies that are not so well
informed as It is. The Imparting of such
information to the men, he said, has a
tendency to make them more interested
in their duties, and he concluded by tell
ing the officers that before they are com
petent to impart Information they must
obtain it through . personal effort and ob
servation. -

lll^l^lllppip OF WINTER.
The coiiiirig -of winter, with its v icy winds, damp, foggy weather, and sudden .changes
in temperature, will set the old, rheumatic joints to aching and the muscles to.throbbing and
twitching with such pains as only Rheumatism can inflict. Chronic sufferers need no better
weather signals to warn them of approaching storms than their aching bdhes and muscles.
They know from "experience how the damp, easterly winds and night air increase their
misery and rob them of restful sleep. Rheumatism is always worse in winter. Cold and
dampness are exciting causes ; they affect the circulation, stop perspiration, and the poi-
sonous acids in the blood, no longer able to. escape through the pores, settle upon the
nerves and tender linings of the joints and muscles, causing inflammation and swelling
and such terrible piercing pains that no wonder the . , ..
nerves are shattered, the health undermined; and the _. Columbus Ohio, May 10. 1903.

Â¦with' the rulings of the law he can see no
way out but to send the three men back
to their native land..
.They have engaged. the services of At
torney Alfred and intend making a vigor
ous fight to be allowed to land.
- Captain Shell, acting Commissioner of
Immigration, states that their cases are
practically, the same as the case of Ken
neth Harper, who came here under simi
lar circumstances under contract to work
for the Bank of British j North America.
His case was appealed to Washington, but
be'. was not successful in getting the relief
granted, and he- will be deported back to
New South Wales on the steamer sailing
on next Thursday.
'. Mansucta Penvacchl, the third member
of the trio, Is an Italian and 13 unable to
converse In the English language or to
.understand . it, and no interpreter being
present no information could be elicited
from him. The passengers detained with
him j offered the information that he was
a marble-cutter by trade.
"I came to this country with the inten
tion of seeking a position as manipulator
of a diamond drill, for which I expected
to receive $1 per day. I was bound for
Colorado, where a brother-in-law of mine
lives. On arriving at this port I had
about $50 In my possession. I had made
wo agreement to work for. any one, but
came with the Intention of securing work
at my trade, which I understood was not
difficult to do. On being questioned- by
the Immigration Commissioner I Informed
him of all â¢ these facts, and gave him in
no way to understand that I came,under
an agreement or contract to work. for
any one." Â» r
"My reason for coming to this country
was to secure work as a laborer, and I
intended to go to Nevada, where a broth
er of mine lives, who assured me in a let
ter that if I should come I would . not
have . any difficulty in securing employ
ment. I have about $70 In addition to the.
amount I paid for passage. I Informed
the Immigration Commissioner of these
facts and showed him the letter from my
brother,- but did not tell him that I was
under contract, but simply that I intended
to go to Nevada and work for my broth
er, at what or for what wages I did hot
know. -There was nothing in the letter to
suggest that I was under contract."
W. G. Stephens, another of the trio,
says:
William Clarke, W. G. Stephens and M.

land fiotri the steamer Sonoma, The Im
migration Commission, however, claims
that the three men in" question are* con
tract laborers and that they. must be de
ported batik to the respective places from
which they came*. The men in question
deny that they came here under any con
tract, and are indignant that they are be
ing held up.
The Sonoma arrived here from the Anti
podes on the 9th inst., and these particu
lar passengers allege that they were ap
proached by ofilcers of the Immigration
Commission and asked to sign a docu
ment, which they did, without under
standing the import of its contents. It ap
pears from their statements that the doc
ument stipulated that they were contract

"As a rule men who can get good beer
or wine at a canteen will not leave the
reservation for the . purpose & of getting
stronger beverages. A properly conducted
canteen or post exchange, where the sol
dier may play a game of cards with his
comrades, drink a glass or two of beer
or wine, smoke a cigar and tell a story,
is a good thing for the army, and it does
not lead to intemperance."
San Francisco is one of the most im
portant military stations of the United
States and the city Is the home of a large
number of prominent officers on the re
tired list. The army men are reading the
news from Washington with the keenest
interest and the army .women are i on the
alert.', to ascertain what took' place at a
recent court-martial , at the Presidio. It
is the general talk that the promotions:
of Funston and Bell are all right. . It
is claimed, however, that the rule. or prio-!
ci pie should be established that an of
ficer who has' never commanded a. regi
ment fn' the 'field 'should not be commis
sioned as a brigadier general.'
Bliss, Barry, Grant and Carter are
spoken of as worthy men,. but it Is main
tained that they,; have . not rendered ser
vice in the field that justifies their pro
motion over the heads of many other of
ficers. .
"Deserters have increased since tha
canteen was abolished. A mistake was
made by the Government in yielding to
pressure of the temperance people on this
point. 'I do not mean to say. that the
abolition of the canteen accounts for all
the desertions, but while its privileges
were extended to the enlisted men at the
army posts throughout the country the
desertions were not greater per annum
than thirty-six out of 1000. Now 100 men
in 1000 annually desert.' No effort seems
to be made to bring back deserters. Tha
theory that high wages paid to civilians
in. many lines of industrial employment
causes men to desert Is not the correct
Idea, The men simply get weary of
the routine of military duty in gar
rison or elsewhere and leave the ser
vice. ' The canteen, properly con-'
ducted, tends ..to keep the. men in
camp. It ; relieves the monotony.. of mili
tary life. A grievous mistake was made
when it was abolished and It should be
re-established for the benefit, df the army.
Liquors such as whisky, rum, brandy, gin
and absinthe were not sold to the men.
Wines and beer were the bnly intoxicat
ing beverages on sale. The canteen sys
tem is in operation at the National and
State, homes for disabled volunteers. , I
understand that there is only one home
in the United States where "the vending
of whisky at the canteen is permitted. I
stood for one hour in the canteen at Day
ton, Ohio, and saw how it was conducted.
No whisky Js sold there. Veterans can
get beer or wine. in limited quantities. The
sergeants on duty keep a closo watch on
the men and when they observe a tenden
cy on the part of a veteran . to imbibe
loo freely the sergeant steps up and says:
'Fresh air .will do you more good than
another drink. Come, old man, take a
walk.'.'^-,^ . . : Â¦. .
The large number Â¦ of desertions from
the army, as shown by the last report of
the adjutant general, causes quite a deal
of comment In army circles. According
to the synopsis of the report recently
wired from Washington, 5000 men desert
ed during the last yearâ or 10 per cent of
the entire force of enlisted men.
A well-known army officer, retired, in
speaking yesterday of the large percent
age of desertions, made these remarks:

Notwithstanding that the evidence
showed that the policeman on hand acted
hastily In firing his revolver, he was dis
charged.
Mrs. Kavanagh alleges that her hus
band has been a policeman for the last
cloven years and that he has a bank ac
count of ilOOO. She says that he also re
ceives in addition to his salary as an of
ficf-r an income of $23 a month from realty
owned by him. It is also alleged that he
owns an interest In a bowling alley at
Washington and Kearny streets.
Kavanagh, who is knovvn as the Adonis
of the Police Department, about ten years
ago phot and killed a striker at Fulton
and Webster streets. At tnat time the
men employed In the different breweries
of the city had" formed a union, and as
the wages were not satisfactory to them
they decided to go on a strike. Kavanagh,
whose beat was on Webster street, a few
days after the commencement of the
strike, saw two men. who afterward
turned out to be strikers approach a resi
dence in the "vicinity of the National
Brewery, and suspecting, as he claimed,
that they were burglars he opened flre
on them, after ' they had failed to heed
his command to halt. One of the men was.
instantly killed, but the other managed
to escape. The friends of the dead man
at once instigated an investigation with
the result that Kavanagh was arrested
and charged with murder. It developed
at the preliminary examination of the ac
cuseo policeman that the two strikers
had approached the residence intending to
i slip a circular under the door asking the
occupants not to purchase beer from the
breweries which w"ere under the ban,
when Kavanagh, thinking they were
burglars, as he claimed, fired tho fatal
shot.
Charlotte M. Kavanagh, wife- of Police
man James M. Kavanagh, Sled a suit for
maintenance against him yesterday, al
leging that from the time she became bis
wife last September up % to the 9th "of
November, when she left him, he failed
to provide her with the common neces
saries of life. She alleges further that
she was compelled to ask money from her
friends with which to purchase " food and
that she was compelled to borrow bed
clothes from her parents.
the young men arrested on Friday night
oa suspicion of holding up C. 1L Forrest,
conductor, and E. M. Emlet, gripman, of
a Hayes-street car at the terminal on
Plat: van street.
They discovered that they had been
rooming at TSS'/j Market street, and on
examining their room they found false
mustaches and letters sent to Ernest
Good by a girl signing herself "lone,"
Irons- Phoenix, Or. In one of the letters
the girl wajits to know where he was
getting aJJ the money, and asks ff he had
been robbing a bank, lie had apparently
asked her to coir.e here and join him, as
she wrote that as she was only 16 years
of age they would require the consent of
her parents before they could get mar
ried, but she would come and be known
as his sister. One of the letters was ad
dressed to ECS Broadway, Oakland, and
she wrote that his aunt had told her he
was â¢worklns there.
Both prisoners declared that they did
not leave the lodgir.g-house on Market
street on Friday nizht till 7:30 o'clock, but
the landlord told Dinan and Wren that
he saw them leave an hour earlier. They
also told, the detectives that they left Ore

Drama and charity went' hand In hand
last night when "Dream Faces" was pro
duced at Lyric Hall for the benefit of the
Episcopal Old Ladies' Home. Preceding
the production were a series of beautiful
living pictures posed by well-known the
atrical models indicating "Vlttoria Co
lonna," "Lisense," "La Poesie Antique,"
"Laura." "Violetta," "Clemence Isaure"
and Â¦ "Venltenne." .
. The living pictures were exceedingly
good In their way, but the crowded house
wanted the play, and when It came on the
house was appreciative and acplauseful.
The play was a time-honored production
Of T[V"ynn Sillier, brimful of dramatic sug

WILIi- PROSECUTE \ CLARK.
The missive was from Dr. J. Graham,
Clark's partner, and the writer advised
Creely to issue a certificate to ' Clark,
adding that the latter would pay the
sum of $50 for the same. .It went on to
explain what a good chemist and veter
inary Clark was, and wound up with the
Information that any good lawyer in

him no matter, what happened, r .. â¢ j
- As Boon as Creely finished reading the
letter he turned it over to William Ma
gulre, attorney for the association, and
then went before Police Judge Fritz and
swore to a complaint charging Clark
with offering a bribe through the agency
of his partner, Graham.-
Yesterday morning Creely received a
certified check for $26 from Clark, and in
another note to Creely arrived a freight
receipt showing that a package valued at
$100 had also been sent by Clark to the
secretary of the association.
Creely says that lie did not know what
to think of the presents and laid them
aside, for further consideration, when
another letter arrived. This . was . sent
from Dr. Archibald of Alameda, presi
dent of the association, arid when Creely
opsned it he found that it contained a
lejter for him, sent in care of Dr. Archi
bald.
According to Creely, Clark, who is an
old chemist of Fresno, wrote to the as
sociation'about a month ago asking for
a certificate, and adding that he was un
able to be present in this city last Sep
tember when the credentials were award
ed the various legal veterinary, surgeons
throughout tho State.
Creely wrote back to Clark stating
that It was impossible to procure a cer
tificate after September 13 and that he
would have to wait till the following
year. Clark did not seem to take this
answer as final and wrote several other
letters requesting the coveted paper.
RECEIVES A CHECK.
Dr. Edward J. Creely, secretary of the
State Veterinary Medical Association,
swore to a complaint in Police Judge
Frits's court yesterday morning: charg
ing G. F. Clark of Fresno with offering a
bribe. Creely alleges that Clark at
tempted to procure a certificate from the
board by means of money. The offer of
coin was directly made by Dr. J. Gra
ham, Clark's partner, in aletter sent by
the latter to Creely, so the complainant
alleges.
The Right Rev. Bishop Nichols has
called upon all the clergy of his diocese
to join him in retreat to be held the first
week of advent and to continue four days.
From the time the Bishop came into
the jurisdiction it has been customary
to hold an annual meeting of this char
acter and the result has invariably been
to stimulate the clergy in their pastoral
work and to increase and strengthen the
sense of fellowship as well as the spir
itual life of the diocese. The "retreat" of
1903 Is expected to attract a large ma
jority of the clergy and will be' held at
Belvedere, where the hotel will be re
opened for its accommodation.
The services, from which the laity are
excluded, will be in the pretty chapel',
which has just been erected. A commit
tee consisting of Dean William Carson
Shaw of the Church of the Advent, Oak
land; Dr. W. F. Clampett of Trinity, Pro
fessor J. O. Lincoln of Son Mateo, Father
Parrish and Rev. -D. O. Kelley, have had
the arrangements in charge. . One of the
clergy, speaking of retreats, said that
every diocese in" the church held them
some time, or other and that it was an
ancient and general custom. Retreats are
held usually in the solemn season of ad
vent at the beginning of the ecclesias
tical year. The only speaker at Belve
dere will be the Bishop. ~ --Â¦'â¢â¢
The holy eucharist will be administered
early in 'the day before repast, after
which the.clergy will meet in the .chapel,,
when the subject will be announced for,
the hour's meditation. The clergy will
then retire" to their. rooms for prayer and
self-examination. Silence will be kept
by all but the Bishop. In the afternoon
another meditation and in the evening
Btill another. This will continue for four
days, when Â£ parochial work will be re
sumed. Retreats are of spiritual benefit
to the clergy and bring reconsecratlbn
and greater devotion. That of 1903 will
begin Tuesday, December 8. " Â¦ "Â¦ Â¦

FOOTBALL GAMES WON AND LOST.
Continued - on Page 32 i Column 1Â»
THE annual football game be
tween " Stanford University
and the University of Cali
fornia Is over at last and the
fourth tie in the champion
ship series has gone on record. ' The score
represents approximately the relative
strength of the, two "teams, when every
feature, of the game Is considered. Reck
oning without â¢. the kicking of Overall.
Stanford had the better eleven. Had the
cardinal played the game thrpugh as
they commenced, the result would prob
ably have been different. Stanford's
strength and" speed were a revelation^
California's line proved a disappointment. "
.. Bansbach's" long' op and Heitmuller'8
blocking; of .thekfSc were the perform
ances which . resulted in the score, but
both plays were only incidental features
of the * game' and â¢ Indicated â¢ no special
point.of, ability, In ejther team. The real
contest was waged' back and forth across
the center, of " the â¢ field. Stanford's goal
vaÂ» more frequently in danger 'than was
California's. '.The' blue " and gold ', line
failed signally to stop the cardinal backs.
. ,WeIler , seemed good for a" gain ; at any
time. , Overall and Stow and Howard and
HeitmuIIer ,- were * passed without great
difficulty by " the *, big â¢ Stanford freshman.
Then : Dole would be sent through one of
these : ir. en, who Â» were Â¦ commonly sup
posed ; to >be > invincible, and Chalmers
would follow Dole. It looked pretty dark
California's eleven men began the last
half with a Â¦ determination to win or die
fighting. Every man played as though
his life depended on the. result. The blue
and gold was desperate. As the play pro
gressed, Cnllicrnla's play improved until
the end was rear, and then, of course,
the captain took some chances in t the
hope of getting another score.
The blue and gold was penalized sixty
yards. .Stanford lost thirty-five yards for
neglecting ' to observe the rules of the
game. California's backs did well, al
though-they did not seem to make gains
. equal to those of the Stanford men behind
the line. - Overall's line work was no:
above the average and Thompson seemed
toying with California's star man at
times. â¢ The blue and gold captain did
splendidly, however, when he went be
hind the line.
â California's left seemed unaccountably
weak. .' The opposing' linemen seldom
failed to open big holes" at this point. .The
cardinal- line for five-sixths of the game
was as impregnable as. Gibraltar. Time
and. again . the California backs went at
it like battering rams only to be downed
for California after the touchdown by
Bansbach. considering the fact that the
cardinal was putting up a better game.
But- somehow . 01 other, after the first
half, the boys in the new uniform*
slacked up. It seemed they felt safe with
their lead and were only attempting to
prevent their rivals from scoring.
PLAY DESPERATELY.
Captain Bansbach, of Stanford Team,
Is the* Hero of the Day.
Then in the second half came Berke
ley's surprise. The ball was away down
on Stanford's three-yard line, but be
longed to the cardinal, team. Dole dropped
back to punt the oval out of danger, and
as he did so patted Sprott, left tackle,
and whispered into his ear. But the gritty
lineman had been pounded into ' a <daze
and when Dole held out his hands to get
the ball, big "Heiny" HeitmuIIer. Sprott's
opponent, dashed the weakened tackle
out of the way and, springing into 'the
air, stopped the' flying pigskin just from
Dole's boot ! Grappling the" ball, "-he
tucked It under his' arm' and 'lunged
through the sand behind the goal posts.
Then Overall kicked & ticklish goal? and

snapped back and a part of the Stanford
men surged forward as If to open a hole
for the charging backs, when out from
? k 8 JÂ°? gle Ot JÂ°Â« tlln S figures appeared
the lithe form of Bansbach, the Stanford
capUin. About Hudson's end he sped
nestling close up to the men who were
breaking a way for him. Then with only
one supporter, he dashed down the check
ered field toward the goal posts seventy
five yards away. Johnny More the
Berkeley quarter, strained every muscle
to catch the flying figure, but he was
dashed to the sand by Bansbacb's de
fender and the little captain was in a
second lying panting behind Berkeley's
goal with the pigskin hugged to his mole
skin jacket. It was an easy goal to kick
and cardinal smothered the bleachers for
full five minutes.
gridiron struggle between the
two great universities came to a close
with honors even.
That eame out at the Richmond field
yesterday was a typical thirteener. Back
ward a^d forward swung the tide of vic
tory, settling first on the cardinal pen
nants and then on the blue and gold. Any
minute of play might change the Inde
cisive struggle Into a victory. The breath
of twenty thousand people hung pent up
upon the every move of the twenty-two
grimy, bloodied men out there on the
j-quared sand. A slip, a trick, the turn
of a hair might convert one-half of those
twenty thousand people into howling
maniacs and the other half into morose
hypochondriacs. Ob. what a case of
nerves those twenty thousand had!
Both scores w*re made in the wink of
an eye. Both shot unexpectedly out of
the grindfr.g torture of smash upon
*mash of fruitless playing. Each was the
Mgnal for a burst of delirious Joy upon
the part of the rival banks of color which
can only find its equal at a football game.
The ball was on Stanford's forty-yard
line. The cardinal team bent low to the
ground for the next play; the eleven big
men from Berkeley set themselves for a
shock 2a their. mii-iise. The bail wu
YE-B-OW! What a game that

STANFORD'S SHOWING
DELIGHTS DR. JORDAN
PRESIDENT DAVID STARR JORDAN of Stanford
University said in an interview : 'The two elevens
were fairly evenly matched, and the game was a good, sports
manlike exhibition. P:\ery man on the field played straight
football and played it like a gentleman. Stanford played a hard
game and overcame the disadvantage in weight. The work
of our light line men was particularly gratifying. Stan
ford's team this year deserved to win. There have never been
eleven football players who trained more faithfully nor ob
served training rules more strictly than the Stanford team has
this year. To their conscientious training and Lanagan's
coaching the showing made by the eleven this afternoon is
due. At no time during the season has there been anything
done by the Stanford players that could possibly have been
objected to by any of the faculty committees. They have kept
up their college work and strictly observed training rules."

PRESIDENT . BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER of Uni

was an excellent game and an interesting spectacle to wit
ness: The two sides were certainly evenly matched. I may
be prejudiced, but I am inclined to think the Berkeley mate
rial, on the whole, was^ better. The Stanford men showed bet
ter command of some features of organization and strategy
of the game as it is developed in the ,East. /The game was
cleanly flayed throughout by the men on each team. The spec
tators must feel they received ample return for their money.
Personally I wish the game had been decided one way or an
other, and I wish Berkeley had won. I am proud of my boys.

SANTA CLARA, Nov. 14.â WTiile play
ing with a 22-callber rifle this morning
Carl Young, aged 12 years, was shot In
the back by his twin brother, who acci
dentally discharged the gun. The spinal
column was torn partially In two and the
injured lad la not expected to live.
The bullet entered the back between the
shoulder blades at the fourth dorsal verte
bra, penetrated the backbone and en
tered the soft flesh beyond, where the
surgeons were unable to locate it. From
the oolnt of injury to the extremities the
lad is paralyzed, although his mental fac
ulties are unaffected and he seems to suf
fer little pain. He wa3 taken to a sani
tarium in San Jose this afternoon and 13
this evening in a very critical condition.

and scarcely musical; but the bark of the
yells sounded best.
COLLEGE PRESIDENTS ARRIVE.
.As fair omen-to the launching of their
fighting' machine, 1 the Stanford enthusiasts
copied the. christening ceremonies which
the Japanese use for their worships, and
let loose a score of pigeons, each with the
burning red- streamer of LL S.-J. U. flap
ping from its feet. The frightened birds
sailed- over the -gridiron -In crazed dashes
and then trailed off cityward, bearing
their message : of hope to any belated
boarde.r In the Stanford ark who mipht
be swe'aring softly at the blockaded strtet
car- down near the dummy depot.
Golden-hued even down to his obviously
new riding boots, -President Wheeler ap
peared on the field and was warned by
one of the bluecoats that It required a
yellow sideline badge" to stay there. The
Berkeley rooters would riot let their pres
ident be treated badly and they cheered
him to the echo. Then the well-known
broad shoulders of Dr. Jordan appeared
through the press at the gate, and the
cardinal streamers /zig-zagged wildly,
while the cheers jumped out to greet him.
Cleve Baker of Stanford got so heated In
leading the yell that he had to remove
his jacket, and remained in spotless white
as to his upper garments like' any Sadie
girl. -

several times during the game.
The field was slow and the players
slipped on various occasions when, gains
might otherwise have been made. > The
sun had dried up the ground much bet
ter than was expected. The ball did not
get slippery, which saved the contest
from being a game of luck. Fumbles were
rather too frequent. In team play Stan
ford completely outclassed California,
Most of the time the Cardinal machine
worked in excellent shape. The blue and
gold men were not at all accurate lnget
tins Into the plays.
Stanford's interference was vastly su
perior to that of her opponents. Califor
nia seemed to have isuffered a slump, as
the eleven did not play in as good form
yesterday as earlier in the season. There
was little rough play and 'no slugging,
which speaks well for .the spirit of such
a great intercollegiate athletic battle.
The men on both teams tackled rather
poorly on the average. Several times a
player would attinvpt to stop a runner by
grasping him about the neck. The backs,
with the exception of Weller, went into
the line low. He gained distance all the
time, but he would have done better had
he pulled his head down. * t Â¦
GAINS ON KICKS.
Berkeley kicked sixteen times for' 6S5
yards and Stanford'fourteen times for 520
yards. Overall sent the ball cighty-nve
yards once, although it rolled for thirty
five vards on the ground. Both teams
played fast football when they had the
chance. Many men began to be fagged
during the last half and time was called
after every second play.
All of 6tanford t 's men played -a good
game. Bansbach *ls, of course, the hero
of the day from the standpoint of the
Cardinal. Weller did splendid work, and
Clark, Thompson and Chalmers also dis
tinguished themselves. Shields and Ja
cobs Eurpassed in their playing the ardent
expectations of their team's supporters.
Sprott played like a fiend until he was
put out. For the last twenty minutes of
the second half he did not know what he
was about.
California's line seemed weak at almost
ever}' point Demerritt made several bril
liant plays and Hudson worked like a

without gain. There were almost no end
runs In the game.
The Inside tips before the contest were
that California was to punch -holes In
Stanford's line and that the cardinal
backs were to circle the alleged weak
ends of their opponents. The blue and
cold team played according to pro-
Kran>m*s bnt Stanford sprung the big sur
prise cf the Say by playing directly at
what wore generally considered to be
California's strong points. It was Coacji
Lacagan's scheme and it worked well.
BOTH TEAMS SCORE.
Stanford was close up to her forty-yard
line when the p4ay was made which re
sulted in a touchdown. Bansbach took
the ball for a quarterback run and De
merritt on California's left end was mis
led by the rush of cardinal Locks to the
cipofite side of center. So Bansbach had
It pretty much all" his own way when he
xvRP fairly started. It was straight foot
ball but it only happened to result for
tunately a? quarterback runs are not on
the regular schedule for securing touch
down at long distance. Had the men of
the opposing team played as they have
been coached Daubach might have made
twenty yards, but never seventy.
Theblue and gold eleven won its touch
down through the individual work of
Heitmuller. The tackle got in front of
the ball and dropped on it. The unpleas
p.nt feature of this play was the fact that
thÂ«Â» man whose business It was to stop
Heitrauller was as groggy as a beaten
pugilist. Sprott was laid out time after
time in the liret portion of the second half
end he had to be helped to his feet and
fteered to his place in the lice after al
most ever>' Play. His face was as white
as chalk and he should have been taken
to the 6ide lines.
On account of Sprott's condition Dole
was cornmlEtsoned to do Stanford's punt
ir.g. When the cardinal had the ball
c!cse to her own goal line, a kick was or
dered. Heitmuller went through Sprott
as if there were no man at that point,
blocked the kick in splenflld shape and
finished up the- job by failing on the balL
California's goal was rather more dif
ficult to kick than Stanford's.

the opposing lineman was overwhelmed.

of the unprejudiced- onlookers seemed to

Coach Stagg Administers. Electric Treatment Daily to His Unbeaten Maroon Eleven â This
"Chain Lio'htninsr" Adds Snao and^Viffor to the Play.
BY JOHN FRANCIS BYRNES.
Electricity has taken another stride for-
ward, and this time It ha* been used so
Fucccssfully that there is little doubt that
predictions that have been made as to Its
efficiency in human ailments will be ful-
filled far beyond the expectations of its
predictors.
Coach Stagg cf the University of Chi-
cago has been using electricity on his
football squad with good results, and now
coaches of other football teams are adopt-
ing the same methods.
It is claimed that his mode of treatment
far surpasses anything that has ever been
used In conditioning athletes for strenu-
ous work. It seems to Invigorate every
nerve and muscle and the result is more
ginger and wisp are perceptible in the
movements of the men who have been
put through this course of treatment.
There is no doubt that this treatment
was suggested to Mr. Stagg by the exper-
iments of the noted Professor Loeb, who,
Â¦when connected with the Chicago Uni-
every instance, made them as strong and
vigorous as ever. Among the number are
Tommy Ryan, Young Corbett, Terry Mc-
Govern. Dave Barry and many others
whom it would take up too much time to
enumerate. My treatment has not been
confined to pugilists alone, as I have on
my list baseball players of prominence,
and many who have won honors in other
branches of athletics.
' "Now take the case of Tommy Ryan,
i for instance. He was a man who had
reached the highest pinnacle in the prom- ,
inence of a pugilist, and just after attain-
ing this point he found that the exces-
sive, training he was accustomed to go
through and other causes sapped his vi-
tality, and he was in a fair way to break
down. â¢ He had tried many remedies, but
none of these seemed to do him any good.
Ke came to me as a last resort, and
from the very first application of my
electric appliance his health began to im-
prove, and now he Is as vigorous as ever,
and here la a. letter which I recently re-
verity, experimented successfully with
electricity, and proved, without doubt, to
the world that electricity is what consti-
tuted life, and without It we could not
live.
It will bÂ« remembered that his letters
in &11 the newspapers were eagerly read
and commented upon, and that Dr. Mc-
Laughlin, the famous electrical expert,
claimed that he. and not Professor Loeb,
was entitled to the honor of being the
discoverer of this principle, and backed
his claims by producing books that he
has written and published several years
before Professor Loeb's announcement,
containing the same arguments and rea-
sons why Electricity was responsible for
our living.
la view of this. I was anxious to secure
for publication Dr. McLaughlln's opinion
on this subject, and my interview with
him will undoubtedly - be read with in-
terest.
The doctor emlled when I Inquired if he
had read the articles that appeared in
the newspapers on the use of electricity
as an Important adjunct to the training
of athletes, and he said he had, and add-
ed that, as usual, I was several years be-
hind the times in seeking Information
from him, and. as on previous occasions,
he was going to prove to me what now
Â¦eemed new to me had actually been in
use by him for a number of years past.
I told him I would appreciate It very
much if he would give me as much infor-
mation as possible on the- subject, as I
thought it would prove of vital import-
ance to the world at large. He then said:
"Nothing gives me more pleasure than
to bear of some person of prominence be-
coming an advocate of electrical treat-
ment, for, as you know, it has been my
life-long Etudy. and when a man like
Stagg, who has a reputation for condi-
tioning athletes second to none In the
country, comes forth and says that he
recognizes the value of Electricity as a
strength builder, it assists me materially
in proving what I have, been advocating
for the past twenty-two years.
"I have had a host of athletes who
have coma to me la a debilitated state
from one causa or another and I have,' In
ceived from Tommy. You will note that
he Bays that he would not think of train-
Ing again without the use of my electric
appliance."
The doctor here showed me a letter
from Tommy Ryan, which I read, and it
certainly was a strong recommendation of
the doctor for his. electric appliance. He
in turn handed me letters written him by
Corbett, McGovern and many other ath-
letes of prominence, and they were all
equally as strong in their commendation
I of the doctor and his method of treat-
ment. . -
I then said: "Doctor, how is this ac-
complished by your Electric Appliance?"
and he replied: \y. <- ? ;
"By restoring: Nature's vitality. I flnd 1
the physical system wanting in the vital
energy which nature intended it to have.
This vitality has been wasted in one way
or another and I restore it Excessive
waste is due to overtaxation of the vital
forces, and may be caused by hard work
mentally, grief or worry, extra physical
exertions, severe fevers and many other
causes, which drain away vitality and
leave the system in a debilitated condi-
tion.
"The electrical heat generated by the
consumption of our food should 1 keep
healthy every vital organ of tho body.
Debility of the vital organs arises when
the waste is greater than the repair;
when the stomach is not able to generate
Eufflcient electric heat to supply the de-
mands of the vital organs the natural re-
sult is a lowering of nerve, organic and
muscular powerâ general debility. Then
an artificial agent must be used to assist
the stomach.
"That agent is electricity and the only
successful way known to science of ap-
plying it is by the aid of my Dr. Mo
Laughlln Electric Belt."
"But. Doctor," I said, "will not elec-
tricity applied In other ways do this?"
and he replied:
"No, there is but'one way of applying it
Intelligently, and that is my way. The
current supplied by my appliance enters
the body in a glowing stream of vitalizing
heat, bo gentle that the nerves and vital
organs absorb It freely. This force is
added to the natural power generated by
the stomach; it saturates every vital part
and soon transforms" the debilitated body
Into a natural storage battery, which gen-
erates Its own health and closes the doors
forever to disease and debility.
"The wide range of troubles which can
be reached by restoring vitality would
surprise you. Head this letter from Mr.
M. O. Rollins, box 846, Bisbee, Arizona.
He says:
I have worn the electric Belt three months,
and the good ft has done me has been continu-
ous. My stomach is In good order, the heart
action all right, my varlcocele is rapidly disap-
pearing- and every complaint gradually yield-
ing. My condition was very serious when I
commenced your treatment, and it does not
seem possible that in so short a time bo great
an improvement could be brought about. I
have sooken to several men about the Belt,
and they are surprised to Know the great
range of troubles this form of treatment
reaches, but what it has done in* my case is
eufflclent to prove to them its efflcacy, so I
hare no doubt but that you will hear from
some of them.
"You take a man who Is thin, puny and
unnourlshed in appearance and pour this
electric life into his body every night for
a few months, with the proper exercise
to draw it- into the muscles and tissues,
and you can add twenty-flve pounds to
his weight, double his strength and vi-
tality and transform him into a giant In
strength, as I have often done.
"An example of what I am doing In this
respect is the case of Mr. A. Hubbs,
Callstoga, CaL. who says that he has
gained eight pounds, that his strength 13
restored and all aches and pains have left
him since he got the belt.
"Look at the men who have worn my
Belt and you will see men of force, men
of power and confidence, men who re-
spect themselves and are respected and
admired by their fellowmen.
"Poor digestion, inactive liver, consti-
pation, sluggish heart, slow thinking, dor-
mant energy and laziness are all due to
the lack of electricity. Understand that
electricity is the motive power of the
human machine, the power- that keeps
the organs active, and you will see what
I mean. In such cases you can see bow
my Electric Belt will pump action into the
body. ' It renews the electric life and
transforms the sluggard into a bundle of
vigorous energy.
"It Is truly the foundation of youth to
men who have begun to feel older than
they are. and It la a fine thing for an
eld man who wants to feel young. It ,*s
over two years now since I got a letter
from Mr. A. Crawford, of Pokegama,
Oregon, in which he said: 'I asked you
to send me something to make an old
man â¢ young, and you did. I have worn
your belt three months, and am as vigor-
ous as I- was when a young man. I am
seventy years old and can do as much
work as I could at thirty-five.' .
"That sounds pretty good, and to show
you how remarkable It Is here Is a letter
that I received from Mr. Crawford the
other day:.
In reply to your letter I am glad to say that
I am just as much In favor of your Belt as I
ever was, for It has been a remarkable hÂ»lp to
me. I am 72 years old, but I do not look any
more than 6a Am enjoying perfect health and
will continue to recommend tne Belt, as I have
been doing right along, as I realize that but
for It I should have bÂ«Â«n dead and burled by
this time.'
' "This agitation of the subject Is going
to prove of incalculable benefit to the
future health of our race. Just satisfy
the -people that they can procure a re-
newal of bodily vigor and health by sim-
ply renewing the electricity In the body
and you have given them what they hare
always prayed forâ a relief from noxious
Â¦ drugs. Convince a suffering man or wom-
an that* drugs will not cure them, and
that all they need is a new supply of
electricity, and you - have mads them
happy.
"So many people suffer from pains and
aches, called rheumatism or lumbago cr
neuralgia, due to impoverished nerves,
crying for aid. The life of these nerves
is electricity and nothing else will cure
them. I can send a gentle current from
my Electric BÂ«It so that It will convey
the life direct to the ailing part and re-
lief is often felt In an hour. I frequently
cure such cases in ten days.
"Here Is a case to Illustrate tho point:
Mr. Jostph M. Elsing, 72a Park Are., San
Francisco, says: *"*Â» *"
I am rlad to tell yoa that I am cored of my
rheumatism. For Tears I was not able to
dress myself without help and suffered terrible
pain, bnt had I taken your treatment I ml*-ht
have saved myself all th!s suffering years ago.
The money I spent paying doctors" bills was all
thrown away. Your Belt has donÂ« for me In a
few months what doctors could not do In three
years* continual treatment. I am glad, to recom-
'mend the treatment to any one sufferlns with
inflammatory rheumatism.
"Suppose we take a man who has in
one way or another overtaxed his system
until it is in a state of abject debility.- the
brain sluggish, all ambition gone, and an
ever present feeling of despondency, a
disposition to give up the fight.
"In that case the electrical force has
been reduced, and there we have the
cause of the debility. Now. replace that
force and you have a rejuvenated man,
aa good as ever.
"Here is a case which Illustrates: Mr.
TV. H. Smith of Acampo. CaL, says:
I am Improving all the time; my nerves are
better and I am better than I have been for
years. I am sure that-, tho Belt is a Godsend

say enoturti for It- SomÂ« poopl* to whom I
speak of the treatment think It is * swindle,
and say that they have been frequently ra' 9 *
led In the past by so-called remedies, but my
cure certainly convinces them that your Belt

"I could cite thousands of similar IncJ- -Â«
dents. -When you see that I have fifty
thousand voluntary testimonials and tnat
there is not a hamlet m this country-

guise, as well as every other form of pain.
"I am an enthusiast, you say! Why-
should I not be? I have the gratitude of
thouaands-of people who have been cured
by my Electric Belts after the failure of

I then thanked the doctor for taking tip
so much of his time, and before leavmr
he handed me a book that he published

Assessor Dodge to Secure Evidence
From Taxpayers to Present to
Equalization Board.
Assessor Dodge yesterday began the is
suance of notices to taxpayers with a
view to securing evidence to combat the
announced intention of the State Board of
Equalization to again raise real estate
valuations in this city next year. Dodge
cays that the 23 per cent raise has result
ed In assessing property at Its full market
value and in many cases theceof Dodge
wants to systematize and tabulate the ev
idence so as to make it effective against
the assaults of the State board. The no
* Uce Kent by Dodge follows:
"The tax bills for the current year are
now ready for deliv*-y at the Tax Collec
tor's oflce. Those taxpayers who have
already secured their bills are aware that
the assessment of their property this year
is 20 per cent greater for State purposes
than it was last year. This la the result
of the recent action of the State Board of
Equalization, taken at Sacramento, and
has resulted In a. large Increase in the
amount of your taxes. In numberless
cases this great Increase made by the
State board has resulted In the assess
ment cf property at a figure e<jual to, if
not In actual excess of, the full market
value of the property assessed. It is" ru
mored that unless the undersigned in
creases the assessment of San Francisco
this year by orer $100,000,000, the amount
which the State board added to our as
sessment, that this board Intends next
year to again raise our assessment. With
a view x>l gathering accurate data for the
purpose of thowlng the injustice of such
action, I request all taxpayers to present
at my office In the City Hall- such data
and evidence as they have, which. would
tend to show the injustice of the recent
raise of their assessment, as made by the
State board. I am satisfied that the tabu
lation of such data will convince even the
most skeptical that San Francisco County
is paying taxes on a larger percentage of
the valuation of Its property than is the
rule throughout the rest of the State."

Princeton could not cope with Yale's
stonewall defense and the play was
Jargely in orange territory.
In the second half, as In the first, Yale's
superiority of offense was apparent. Cap
tain RafCerty's men. rushed the ball with
irresistible ; force toward the orange goal
line and twice, with touchdowns in sight,
the sons of Yale fumbled grievously.
The battle was waged furiously and the
Yale men were the first to show the ef
fects of the struggle. Princeton resorted
to the kicking game, and with but five
minutes to play, another Yale fumble
placed Yale In serious trouble near
her goal line. Luckily for Yale, one of
her own men fell on the ball, but Bow
man, the Yale back, was^ forced to kick
from behind his own goal line.
He punted well to Yale's 42-yard line.
Vetterlein, who was playing back for
Princeton; caught the ball and with great
presence of mind heeled the catch for a
kick from, placement. With the score still
C to 6, the great crowd was breathless
while Dewitt prepared to try for goal at
a slight angle. The distance seemed for
bidding, but Dewitt was superbly equal
to the occasion and shot the ball between
the goal posts in masterly style, thereby
insuring Princeton its first victory in
football over. Yale since 1S99. The game
afforded something of an anomaly. In
view of the fact that Yale, the defeated
team, gained the greater distance both in
bucking and in rushing. Mitchell, the
Yale back, outpunted Dewitt unmistak
ably. Indeed,- Princeton's captain ap
parently had an off day. He punted poor
ly and three tlme3 failed dismally In at
tempts at drop-kicking. In rushing Yale
was much superior. Princeton, however,
was able to handle the ball more cleverly
and was never slow to take advantage of
Yale's mlsplays. â¢
The play was clean throughout and no
penalties for roughing were imposed.
Yale was penalized four times for offside

Yale went down, to defeat be
fore the men of Princeton to-day
In the annual football game on
Yals field by a score of 11 to 6.
The contest, which was one of the most
spectacular ever witnessed on Yale's grid
iron, was stubbornly fought throughout.
Until the last five minutes of play, when
Dewitt, the Princeton captain, kicked a
marvelous goal from placement and
broke the tied score of 6 to 6, the result
was in doubt.
Within fourteen minutes from the time
play began Yale had torn through Prince
ton's line consistently and had sent Ho
gan across the line for a touchdown.

Umpire Dudley Is
Pleased "With
Players.
Says Men Showed
Fine Spirit in
Game.
UMPIRE DUDLEY of Yale, who
assisted Referee Ben Dibblee of
Harvard In yesterday's struggle
on the gridiron, was particularly
pleased with the fine spirit displayed by
the members of both teams throughout
the contest. The officials proved impar
tial in their decisions and were highly
complimented by the captains and by the
coaches of both elevens.
"The teams were evenly matched," said
Umpire Dudley after the game. "Stan
ford displayed the better team work In
the first half. Berkeley was a little faster
Individually In tho second half. The game
was a clean one. The penalties were
never severe and were never given unless
the teams were guilty of offside play or
holding in the line. I did not know the
score until after the game was over. I
was so busy watching the players. Both
teams played a gentlemanly game.
"The feeling was of the best all the
way through. It was a fast game and I
am of the opinion we have good football
material out this way. I cannot Individ
ualize the playing of the men. as I don't
know their names. The. kloklng was fine,
especially in the second half."
Referee Dlbblee proved an activÂ© of
ficial. He was remarkably fast on his
feet and was close to every play and
sounded his whistle when the ball was
downed. At the close of the game he
expressed his high approval of the teams.
He did not care to make comparisons, but
thought the men on each team were
worthy to try for places on the elevens
put forth by Harvard. Yale. Princeton
and'Comell. He also spoke highly of the
spirit displayed by the men In the heat
of contest.
.Dr. A. C. SteckJe, timekeeper and lines
man, was an Interested spectator of the
game. By reason of his long footBall ex
perience he was able to see the strong
and weak points of both teams. In dis
cussing the game, he said:
"I thought it was a most Interesting
game. Stanford had it over her opponent
in the first half, but Berkeley evened mat
ters In the second half. It was a good,
honest, clean contest. I was surprised at
Berkeley's weak defense. Stanford was
strong in her offensive playing. I thought
Berkeley's line would hold better. Bans
bach's run was particularly fine. Ills
teammates backed him up clerverly and
made the touchdown possible. Overall's
kicking was a little bit off color. He made
some good kicks, but on the whole I
thought he would do better. The penal
ties inflicted on both teams were all right.
Both elevens were eager and as a con
sequence were frequently off-side."

Bunton. Tho handicappers figured the re

Scott, and neither had a finger in the pie.
Burnie showed unmistakable signs of
soreness, and this caused trye books to lay
3% to 1 against her chances. John A.

Ly hfr stable connections end the publio.
With seeming impatience the crowd
watched the first three races run off.
The Mp handicap was plainly the attrac
tion. The gross valuation of the stake
was 52400, of which amount J2S00 went to
tha first horse. It was a plum worth
reaching for, and fifteen owners conclud
ed to take a chance on shaking the tree.
In fact, the field was too bulky and un
wieldy, especially as the distance was
only a mile* and It is regretable tUat it
could not have been reduced to, eay, ten.
Harry Stover's Kenilworth. carrying tliia
top weight, 119 pounds, caught the pop
ular fancy and wan installed favorite at 3.
OONCE before Caesar Young's
mare* Eonic, which captured the
rich opening handicap at 25 to 1
from Schwalbe and Ke'nllworth,
furnished a sensation for the turf world.
The danghter of Eon and Mermaid was a
despised outslfler for the Burns handicap
of 1901 and with Lee Jackson and nine
ty-eight pounds to carry 6he led P.
Ryan's JConÂ«s and a big field out for the
richest prize cf the California turf. Since
the close cf racing hero last spring
Eonic has put In a â¢eason of Inactivity
and -though che negotiated miles In 1:40
over the Loa Angeles track recently, this
fact remained a stable secret.
Something of a panlo occurred on tha
ferryboat Bay City, laden down with pas
sengers returning from the races. In
leaving the Blip at the Oakland olds tha
tida caught her and tilted her badly to
port. The frightened women and a few
men on the upper deck immediately mada
matters worse by following the list. Soma
one with more caution than sense ripped
down the slats containing the life pre
servers and started to distribute these
among the passengers. Tho captain
speedily calmed the fears of tha excited.
The boat speedily righted herself and the
alarm died out.
The track was fetlock deep In mud.
After the first race the jockeys came
through the paddock gate splattered so
badly with mire that It would have taken
a chemical analysis to determine
which was the rider and which the mud.
When the sun came out from behind a
bank cf murky clouds It brightened up
the occasion, although It could make no
Impression on the heavy track.
It was a typical race crowd that at
tended the opening. One* who had el
bowed his way through- tha betting ring
or exchanged greetings on the closing
day of last year might have easily Imag
ined racing had never seen an Interrup
tion In California. The familiar figures
were all there, with here and there a
conspicuous outsider. In tho betting ring
there were strangers who are known em
plungers on the big tracks both East and
West. Plenty there were, prominent In
business and professional life, who
thronged the stairs of the grandstand or
made themselves Into rallblrda and took
the spatter from tho track as they
watched the finishes.
Every train was crowded going to tha
track. Despite the football game and
other attractions, there was not a train
on the Berkeley division that did not
belch Its load at the Emeryville track,
continuing until after the second race had
been run.
, V big football game, deprived tha
optnlntf flay of tho New California Jock
ey Club winter race meeting, at Emery
ville, of the usual brilliant Inaugural at
tendance. There were people In plenty
there, the turnstiles having clicked over
the 7000 mane, but from the clubhouse to
the paddock there was lacking the pic
turesque features that ordinarily mark
the opening da/ of the season. No equi
pages dotted %hn Inside field from, which
pretty society women waved dainty greet
ing to the winning horses and their rid
ers. The clubhouse bore a quiet air, al
though the grandstand was fairly filled
with well gowned women and well dre3sed
men.

It Is coming generally to be admitted,
even In Germany, which Invented the
sanatorium, that its main role in the
treatment of tuberculosis is educative.
Curative it may be, but It Is far more
valuable as a means of Imparting knowl
edge about prevention. Until an anti
tuberculous serum Is discovered preven
tion remains the only efficient means of
dealing with this malady, and It is almost
a pity that its importance should have
been obscured by the "fresh-air" cure.
Of "fresh-air" prevention we cannot hear
too much. With open windows, especially
In the purer air of night, and sufficient
food, one may defy tubercle bacilli. When
the responsible members of the Go%'ern
ment follow the advice of every living
hyglenist. rather than their own Igno
rance, and prohibit public expectoration,
there will soon remain no tubercle bacilli
to defy. Meanwhile a tuberculous patient
dies every seven minutes in this coun
try.âLondon Chronicle.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
Shipping Merchants. '
NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
Black cats arÂ« singularly fated to cross
paths. Can you recall a single instance
when a cat of that description ever turned
back or could be frightened into retracing
her steps? She may make a long detour,
but at some point she Intersects your in
tended path, on the scamper, knowing
well her harmful errand. Her apparently
perverse fixity of resolution is, of course,
not her own. In her bosom, as in that
of all feline creatures, burns a spark
from the pit.
The black cat is tha familiar of the
witch and the witch is one of the minis
tering earth-myrmidons of the powers of
darkness. That cat but does the will of a
higher, mind. Black cats are a race apart
from other cats. Did you ever see a black
cat on a dark, night sitting on the fence
top or the coal shed or anywhere, wasting
precious hours in foolish serenades? You
never see anything but white or gray or
tortoiseahell, perhaps mottled cats, en
gaging in such nonsense. No black cats
visible. The black cats are out on their
mission of malevolence, and a swift and
passing glare In the" darkness about as
big as a gooseberry alone betrays their
presence. They have no care to plague
their enemy, man, by merely irritating
his ears when they are the trusted mes
sengers of more dread afflictions.
Other cats travel in line parallel with
your own direction of progress; they play
fully disport along the walk or perhaps
Just inside . the 1 fence, following - you for
blocks, gratefully and affectionately. But
a black cat crosses your path at the first
opportunity. It knows its business.â St.
Louis Globe Democrat. * Â¦,
Every traveler - who hasn't an accident
policy will Indorse Engineer Bittman of
the Lake Shore fast mall, who wouldn't
take his train out until a black cat that
had hidden under the engine was captured
and prevented from running across the
track In front of the pilot. The train
was delayed eleven minutes until the cat
could be taken Into custody, but had it
required an hour to deprive her of liberty
the passengers would have cheerfully sat
there, the men smoking their cigars and
the women opening their handbags and re
adjusting the contents two or three dozen
times more. It doesn't so much matter
what the . signs and portents are after
you are fairly Btarted, but it is the first
evil foreshadowing before the Journey is
begun that is freighted with the deepest
dread.

As the park players have become so
numerous of late, it would be well ' at
this time to reclassifj' them. There are
some In the so-called first class who
should be put down a class. With such
men as MacGavin and Smith in the first
class, many of those who have heretofore
figured in it would be completely out
classed. The same may Se said of the
other three classes. As there axe more
than a hundred players who participate
in the tournaments, it is Impossible to
put them Into but four classes. At this
time there should be at least six or eight
classes.
Entries for all the classes will close on
the ISth lnst. The entries for the mixed
doubles will close on the 24th.
The next event on the California Club
courts will be a handicap singles tourna
ment, which will be open to club mem
bers only. It will be played on Thanks
giving day. The tournament committee
is making arrangements for an open
mixed doubles tournament to be . played
on the club courts. The . annual class
singles tournament will be . played . on
New Year's day.
The Golden Gate Tennis Club has sent
out announcements for two events to be
played the latter part of this month. The
first will be a class singles tournament.
Owing to the large entry list the first and
fourth classes will be played on the 22d
lnst., and the second and third classes
on the 29th. On- Thanksgiving day there
Â¦will be an open mixed doubles event. All
of the good players on both sides of the
bay are expected to participate in this
event.
Most of the balls will be played to Ches
ter Smith. If he handles them as well
as he did last Sunday his team has noth
ing to fear.' Grant Smith was hardly at
his best a week ago, and will play a much
better game to-day. Schmidt had. a good
day last Sunday and played a brilliant
game. He was ably assisted by ; hls
steadier but less brilliant partner; The
match will be three sets out of flv*. '
The event of the week on the tennis
courts will be the final match of the hand
icap doubles tournament commenced on
the California Club courts last Sunday.
It will be played to-day at -2:30 o'clock,
weather permitting. The contestants will
be Herbert Schmidt and Harry Rolfe and
the Smith brothers, Grant and Chester.
The former will play from scratch, while
the latter will be "4-6" back of that mark.
Both teams went through . their
matches rather easily. In one case
Schmidt and Rolfe had some difficulty in
winning. The Smith brothers did not lose
a set. and none was closer than 6-3.
Rolfe and Schmidt beat MacGavln and
Mitchell with odds of "owe 15" in straight
sets. As the Smiths give but "2-C". less
than Mitchell' and MacGavln" did, the
young cracks appear to have. an excellent
chance of winning. Smith and, Smith
went through the Davis cup tournaments
in clever fashion, and won the last four
events straight. They seem to understand
the handicap game thoroughly, and man
age to pull out, no matter what'the odds
against them may be.
When the season opened there were 147
names on the list of players. A week
later ten names were added, and during
the past week eleven more players have

At the last executive meeting of the
California Association Football Rererees'
Union the question of dividing the ref- j
erees into grades was discussed, and
though it Is- felt strongly by some that
this course ought to be followed the com
mittee decided against It by a unanimous
vcte. All the referees In the union will
have the same standing. Arthur Robin
con cpoke strongly against the plan of
classification, and Harry Roberts support
ed him.

2:30 p. m., the Albion Rovers wi9 play
the Thistles. In the match played last
Sunday on the Presidio Athletic
between these two teams the Thistles won
with ease, the Rovers not securing a sin
gle goal. The large score made by the
Thistles was almost wholly <due to tho
Rovers' lack of a competent goalkeeper.

kept goal most efficiently last season, will
be in his old place, and a much closer
contest is expected.

Interesting Fact3 Concerning
Publications in tha Past
Four Centuries.
./The treasures of newspaper history, in
which the British /Museum is so rich,
will. It goes without saying, abide where
they are. Nobody is likely to be consult
ing the Mercurlus Gallobelgicus of 1533,
in the sense in which files are being con
sulted. That copy of the forerunner of
newspapers, as it is regarded, stands by
itself.- strange curiosity. So does the
spurious* English Mercurle of about the
same period, and the Weekley Newes of
fully thirty years later. The Mercu/i:iÂ«
Pollticus of September 2, 1658, had an
account of the death of Oliver Cromwell.
By January. 1661, the Mercurlus Publl
cus was describing the hanging of the
bodies of Cromwell and Ireton.
Between times the restoration had
come, and on May 30. 1660. the Mercurius
Publlcus reported the oroclamation of
Charles II as King. Then Sir .Roger
L'Estrange was editing the Intelligencer,
in August. 1663, and by , 1663 the Oxford
Gazette, which afterward became our
trusty London Gazette, was being issued.
It does not describe fires nowadays, but
in Its eighty- fifth number it gave an ac
count of the great fire of London.
They have 1-cent papers in America,
but there was a London Farthing Post
at so remote a date as December. 1713.
If that was the first farthing newspaper
the Daily- Courant of March. 1702 or 1703.
is believed to have been the 'first daily.
You might read the story. of the stamp
act and its abolition on the face of the
newspaper files at the British Museum.

years after it had begun to appear, re

In 1900 the author of such sets ' con
tributed by London was 1226; by provin
cial England, Wales and the Channel
Islands, 1G64; by Scotland. 2S8. and by Ire
land, 222. These figures show a total of
3400 sets, representing 220,369 single num
bers of papers and kindred publications.
The number of sets in 1890 was 2472. and
the- single numbers of papers 170.833â a
striking increase in the ten years. For
1901 the sets numbered 3170. and the single
numbers 208.5S2. Last year the number of
sets was 3222, comprising 199,067 single
numbers. It is worth noting that of these
sets rather more than a third were pub
lished in London and the suburbs. When
colonial and foreign newspapers are added
It will be seen what a harvest flows to the
museum. Every twelve months It liter
ally gathers into its now well filled vast
ness huge loads of, printed paper.
Yet so carefully kept are the files that
they can readily bo consulted, even when
they are purely local papers. The gen
eral reader does not want them, but it is
interesting to learn that perhaps they
are most frequently needed for their re
ports of law cases.

at Bloomsbury, and this building ia nec
essary at Hendon for the storage of
"newspapers and other printed matter"
rarely required for use.
â¢ That Is the definition which a parlia
mentary statute applies to the purposes
of the Hendon annex. It also requires
that the "newspapers and printed matter
so removed" shall be made available on
due notice being given ,at the museum.
In other words, the newspapers at Hen
don will be brought to London for refer
ence when they are needed. Needless to
say, the files that are constantly being
needed will not go there at all.
Under the copyright act copies of news
papers and periodicals, as of books, must

duced can, in the trite phrase, better be
Imagined than described. In fact, it could
not be described, because much of it Is

newspapers and fortnightly and monthly
publications received there are, however,
sufficiently eloquent.

: In other words, the poultry yard, to a
great extent, is somewhat contemptuously
regarded as a mere incident of his general
business. Sometimes his wife or one of
his children will take hold of that neg
lected . branch and put him to shame
by making it the most profitable feature
of the whole establishment. Yet a delver
in census returns, working for the Brook
lyn Eagle, informs us that last year the
poultry and eggs produced 'and eaten In
the United States were worth more than
all the gold and silver mined in the
world during the same year. Except for
the year 1900, the egg product of this
country has exceeded in value that of its
combined gold and silver output for every
year since 1SS0, which takes in the entire
bonanza period of our history. That, with
the poultry product, also exceeds in value
the = wheat crop of twenty-eight of the
most fruitful ; States and Territories.
Reduced to concrete terms,' in 1S99 the
egg record of this country was 1,290.000,000
dozen. There are\ thirty dozen to a crate,
and 400 crates to a car. so a train of cars
sufficient to accommodate the transporta
tion of all these 1 crates would reach from
Chicago to Washington, a distance of 863
miles, and then . there would remain sev
eral , cars of eggs to spare. In 1900 Iowa
produced 89,000,000 dozen and Ohio 91,000,000,
having a value of over $10,000,000 for each
State. Of course the incubator has con
siderable to do with poultry production,
but' incubators do not; lay eggs. In -a
single ;, year f the value of , the : eggs and
poultry of the country has been as high
as 1280,000.000. ... .>
Think what a hullabaloo has been raised

industry. :. It is only. In quite recent years

Probably the* principal interest ' : felt in
the egg industry by;the average American
citizen lies in the: fact that within the
past six weeks eggs have been working up
from about 30 cents a dozen for the best
quality to close on to 40 cents, to the pur
chasing consumer. This, however. Is not
paying the American hen the respect that
Is her due. She is not only an Important
but wonderfully potential factor of the
agricultural industry of the United States.
Yet even the average : farmer considers
her almost beneath his notice. He leaves
her ' to the women ' and children and be
grudges her almost everything that
makes even the slightest Inroad upon his
ordinary crop : products. To her is as
signed the "stunt" of providing; her own
living, and she must do that by gleaning
behind every regular harvest. After he
has dug and garnered and threshed and
closed his account with each particular
item of productionâ provided he keeps
such ; an accountâ the hen can find her
subsistence in what he has overlooked.

The United States mails are carried ev
erywhere. It would be almost a physical
impossibility for a man to hide himself In
any remote corner of the wor'd without
being discovered at last by some inslgnifl
cact agent of a world-wide service, the
machinery of which operates quietly and
with clock-like regularity. If a bird's-eye
view of the different railroad and steam
ehlp lines which carry the mails could
be taken the giant spider's web thus
formed would appear woven in a pattern
so Intricate that the mind would balk
at the mere suggestion of unraveling It.
And besides the regular steamship and
railroad threads of this maze would ap
pear tens of thousands of cross-lines, rep
resenting pony routes, dog-and-sled
tracks, swift courier and runner "trails"
and even reindeer, whaling-ship and canoe
lines. Every sort of vehicle and beast of
burden and nearly every invention of
man for quick transportation have been
pressed into the postal service, and it is
possible for a letter to go around the
world under conditions so strange that the
mere history of its Journey would form
a story of thrilling interest.
If a man should start from New York
and travel northward to Alaska, then
down the coast to California and take
ehip to Manila, and follow the lines of
travel to Hongkong, to Singapore, to Can
ton, to Tokio, to Vladivostok, to St. Pe
tersburg, to Vienna, to London, to South
Africa, and finally to South America,
touching on the way at several Pacific
<ind south Atlantic islands, and thence
tack to his starting point, he could travel
a distance several times greater than the
circumference of the globe. If he ordered
his mail forwarded to him, and left cor
rect addresses behind at each place, the
letters would dutifully follow him and
finally be delivered to him in New York
a few days after his own arrival there.
All that he would have to pay extra
for this remarkable Journey would be a
dollar or two in tolls, which would rep
resent the charges for forwarding exacted
by come of the countries through which
It passed. There is in the PostoCice De
partment at Washington the envelope of

"An expedient presented itself to the
King by a swarm of bees on the outside
of a window which he ordered opened.
The bees rushed in the court and alighted
on one of the wreaths, while not a single
one fixed on the other. Sheba was baf
fled and was convinced of the wisdom of
Solomon. Such is the story handed down
that the bee only rests on the natural

"The Queen, owing to the splendid repu
tation of King Solomon, whose power and
wisdom had spread to the remotest parts
of the world, visited him at his own court.
Presenting herself at the foot of hla
throne, in each of her hands she held a
wreath of flowersâ one composed of nat
ural, the other of artificial. Art in the
labor of the mimic wreath had exquisitely
emulated the lively hues of nature, so
that at the distance it was held by the
Queen to exercise the sagacity of the
monarch for his judgment it was deemed
impossible for him to decide which wreath
was the production of nature and which
the work of art. Solomon was for a mo
ment perplexed, yet to be vanquished by
a woman irritated his pride.
"Here Is the legend of the visit of the
Queen of Sheba to King Solomon," said
the Pascagoula Diogenes in the rotunda of
the Great Southern Hotel at Gulfport Sun
day. "The Queen reigned over a people
that lived on the border of the Red Sea
who were the richest In Arabia. They
were represented leading an idle life, ow
ing to the abundance of natural produce
of their country, which afforded the sus
tenance of life, and also frankincense,
myrrh, cinnamon and balsam that gave
them an extensive commerce with other
nations.

United States Consul Langer at Solin
gen, Germany, says in a report to the
State Department , that an Inquiry has
been received by the Solingen Chamber of
Commerce at Glessen as to the effect of
the establishment of the German-Ameri
can Petroleum Company's tanks at Solin
gen upon the wholesale and retail dealers
of petroleum, and also as to the manner
in which the petroleum Is ' sold " by * the
company. Through t-Js inquiry the fact
seems to havÂ« been established that the
German-American " Petroleum Company
has attempted, by means of its tanks, to
monopolize the local market,- but thus far
has not been entirely successful, because
quite a number of the local. wholesalers,
although at great sacrifice to themselves,
have steadily opposed the company. The
sales of the German-American Petroleum
Company to the retailer are effected by
means of street tank wagons, and the re
taller is supplied with petroleum-measur
ing apparatus free of <*harÂ«e, which; how
ever. Is kept locked by the company, thus
compelling, the retailer to , use ,the . com
pany's oil. The German-Amerlean Petro
leum Company make* no sales directly, to
the consumer.â Washington Star. .

â¢"The sensation of sound and motion
takes Ihe place In the dreams of the
blind of the objects which appear In the
visions of the night to those who can see.
J Fpeak of those who have been blind al
ways, for, of course, with those who once
.could see, their dreams may be filled with
visions of people and places which their
waking r yr-s cannot now behold, but
which may appear vividly to. them in
f > f p. But one who has been blind al
ways cannot dream of peeing." â Answers.
A man blind from birth, epeaking of the
mental pictures which unfortunates like
himself have of external things, said:
"We get some Idea of shape, more than
we do of size. Of color we have an Idea
cf black and white and of red, but I
think few, if any, of us can comprehend
tiny other hue. We picture the sun as an
immensM* mass, with red rays shooting
about it. and daylight as a million whita
Khafts floating above the earth.
"When a blind man dreams his. dreams
are not like those of other people, but
consist almost entirely of sensations of
sound. He cannot dream of scenes and
places, for he has never 6een them. . For
instance, when we dream of hearing of
our friends we dream of bearing their
voices.
With the Mind's Eye.
Electrical publications j have had their
say about the little thought of difficul
ties that beset an occupation new to the
Industrial world, entered upon with little
or no preparation, yet charged with tre
mendous responsibilities. The care and
nervous strain of the railway engineer
form a hackneyed theme, but no one has
ever, framed the sympathetic side of the
motorman's lot. Yet probably the en
gineer In eight or nine hours' run has
little. If anything, more to wear upon his
nerves or enchain his ceaseless attention
than the man at the controller as he
pushes | his car along the crowded street
with Infinite care, yet with all possible
speed. Danger confronts him every mo
mentâIn the treacherous rail, the weak
but unsuspected axle, the imperfect
wheel, the chance obstruction of heedless
human beings, terrified animals or hurry
ing, unseen vehicles. Perhaps It is a won
der that so few street car accidents oc
cur when ; we consider the", baste with
which the" busy populace demands to be
carried from point to point, the opportu
nities for mishap in equipment or rolling
stock, the always present element of
human error and 'the painful awkward
ness of so many persons in boarding and
leaving cars.â Washington Star.
Trials of the Motonnan.
These labels, it appear*, had no incon
siderable success in game-preserving dis
tricts, and, thanks to the red-ink inscrip
tion, the railway officials were by degrees
Betting Into the habit of forwarding some
thing like the full complement. But,
alas! this state of things was too good to
last, and the labels are now forbidden.
Packages thus decorated are' refused at
the railway stations. It is not, as one
might Imagine, by order of. the railway
authorities, angry at being defrauded of
their prescriptive right, but by command
of the : bureau - of postes et telegraphes,
which has solemnly decided that the
printed warning is a communication In
the nature of a letter, and, therefore, in
admissible. Sportsmen as a body are
appealing for redress against this surpris
ing decision. ~Pall Mall Gazette.
This shooting season a happy Idea came
to a certain firm of printers,, who forth
with designed and issued a new form of
label for the use of generous sportsmen
who might wish to send presents of game
to their friends. It was a good label,
and.unless actually In use In England (as
it may be, for all I know), some enter
prising tradesman might see fit to Intro
duce It. It bore down one side a list of
various sorts of game, with compartments
opposite in which the sender might add
the number of each kind that the box or
basket contained. Underneath was print
ed, in red letters, a warning to verify the
contents.
Departmental red tape Is not wholly pe
culiar to England. It may be discovered,
now and again, on the other side of the
channelâ yes, even In republican France.

The boycott declared by the State Board
of Health of Ohio against the toy pistol
Is one boycott In which all citizens will
uniteâ with the possible exception of the
dealers In the article. Under recent de
cisions of the Supreme Court of the State
the powers and prerogatives of the State
Board of Health are vast and not to be
interfered with in steps it may take to
prevent or to stamp out disease. The
fact that the board has resolved that It
is the duty of Itself and of local boards
of health to prevent the sale of the toy
pistol and like deadly explosives means
business. The facts which moved the
board to its action were found in the
statistics of deaths and accidents arising
from the sale of the toy pistol on July 4,
1903. The statistics, while sufficiently ap
palling, are below rather than up to the
facts, for, in numerous instances, no
answer was returned to the inquiries
sent out to municipalities and to Coro
ners. But from the answers received' it
is shown that more than 600 men and chil
dren were killed on last Fourth from the
use of toy pistols, lockjaw resulting with
death in most horrible agonies; more than
100 persons were made totally blind and
more than 1000 more or less severely in
jured. Under the resolutions adopted by
the board the secretary is directed to
take the proper steps to prevent future
sales of toy pistols, and much good is to
be expected from the important step Ohio
has taken.â Cincinnati Commercial Trib

Legitimate Boycott.
There was a time when the experience
which I am about to relate seemed funny
to me. Indeed, I sometimes used to tell
It on occasions when funny stories seemed
t<> be expected of me, and people used to
laugh at it. But now, as you will proba
bly agree, it is eheer commonplace. The
difference is that In those days only one
particular clas s of citizens made a prac
tice of subletting jobs, whereas now It is
rare that the person who takes the origi
nal contract does any of the work under
U.
In the Einali Western town where I lived
1 leased a house to a man who was In
haste to move in. I had promised to have
the floors scrubbed that day for him, so,
going down town. I found a darky named
Green sitting on a dry goods box in the
â¢un. He eeÂ«med glad to get the job, and
Â«aid he would do it for $2 50. An hour
later I came that way again and found
Green still sitting en the dry goods box.
"See here," said I, "if you are going to
scrub those floors you'd better be about
it. They must be done to-day."
"Oh, dat's all right, suh. Dey's being
Bcrubbed. I done sublet de job to Mistah
Jackson."
A block or bo farther on I met Jackson,
going toward the river with his fishpole.
When I spoke to him about the floors be
eaid:
"Tas, sub, I took de Job fm Mistah
Green, but I done sublet it to Mistah
Meadows."
WelL to cut a long story short, I^met
eo many subcontractors that I deemed it
prudent to go to the house and see for
myself whether the work was being
done. There I found a woman bcrubbing
the floors.
"Who hired you to do this work?" I
asked.
"Mistah Ternary suh," ehe answered.
"How much does he pay you for -it?"
"Fifty cents, suh."
\\ un a view to letting future contracts
to the person who would actually do the
work. I asked the woman her name.
"Ise Mrs. Green. Buh," said she.
Sure enough, she was the wife of the
original contractor. The Job had been
sublet four times, each middle man rak
1ns off as much as was paid to the wo
man vrho did the work. That sort of
thine: was so uncommon In those days
that it really seemed funny, but now it
Is the thing you expect when you let

PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 14.â The will of
th* late William 1* Elklns, the multi-mil
lionaire traction magnate and financier,
was liled with the Register to-day. The
estate is valued at $10,000,000 and upward,
but Is believed to be worth 530,000,000. A
codicil provides for the establishment of
an orphanage in this city for the female
orphans of Free Masons, to be managed
by the Masonic Home of Pennsylvania.
The sum of $240,000 is to be expended on
the buildings. No mention of an endow
ment appears In the wilL
Mr. Anderson added that unless such
Improved service is secured California
cannot long hold her own, as other horti
cultural districts nearer the large East
ern distributing centers are endeavoring
more and more to secure and hold those
markets.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 14.â Lieutenant
Governor Alden P. Anderson announced
to-day that at the close of the present
fruit season he will retire as manager of
the California Fruit Distributors and will
hereafter devote his entire attention to
his orchards and dried fruit interests. He
said there is no question as to the con
tinuance of the organization next year,
as all interests recognize its value and
necessity.
Mr. Anderson declared that the decidu
ous fruit shipping season now closing has
witnessed the largest shipments by sev
eral hundred carloads ever made in one
year from this State, and at the same
time there has been received for the fruit
at sales in the East the best average net
returns, lls said this was the first time
the destination of all shipments has* been
determined and controlled absolutely from
California, and he expressed the belief
that the propriety and advantage of di
recting the shipments from the California
end will never again be questioned.
Mr. Anderson says the most serious
question to. be solved now is that of
transportation; beside it, he declared, all
other considerations pale Into insignifi
cance, and little more can be done toward
systematizing and perfecting distribution
or increasing the volume of shipments
until it is solved. The transportation
companies, he declared, must cater to the
necessities of the fruit business, even at
the expense of the passenger service.

"You are making a serious error," said
the man. "I am merely seeing my sister
off and shall return later."
"Don't make explanations to thisâ thisâ
underling," said the woman. "Report
him to Captain Tumbridge. And for you,"
she continued with another of \ those
glances, the very memory of which makes
the clerk shiver, "your conduct is ob-ob
obstropulous!"âBrooklyn Eagle.
Comparative philology is a most inter
esting subject. The growth of language
is the key to national history and develop
ment. Every contribution of value should
be received with gratitude. Here is such a
contribution from the Hotel St. George,
which deserves recognition and record:
At 12:30 o'clock last night a man and a
woman, dressed for traveling, valises in
hand, came down the elevator and started
to walk out of the main corridor Into the
street. The clerk was dozing, but the un
erring instinct of danger waked him with
a jolt. Summoning a bell boy, he sent a
hasty but courteous summons to the de
parting guests. They came before him
disconcerted, but indignant.
"Isn't this a little unusual?" asked the
clerk, uneasily.
"Slr-r-r!" said the woman with a
withering glance. (The clerk says "with
ering" and the Eagle isn't responsible.)
"What do you mean to insinuate?"
"Nothing," said the clerk, "except that
it isn't customary for our guests to leave
us without notice and withoutâ ahemâ
previous arrangement, at midnight, you
know."
By this time several auditors had gath
ered about the group.

FRESNO, Nov. 14.â There Is little
change In the raisin situation. While or
ders are coming in every day, they are
very light, and no pronounced activity Is
expected for .the present, at least. So far
as deliveries are concerned, this is the
heaviest year in the history af the asso
ciation. Up to date there have been re
ceived 46,000 tons, and deliveries are still
corning in. This is 550 cars in excess of
last year's deliveries, which amounted to
40,050. Last year the deliveries making
up this amount kept coming until well
along in December.
The financing of this year's crop has
been a very difficult proposition on ac
count of the heavy shipments, rushed in
one might say almost at once, and owing
to the comparative slowness that the
East has taken the goods.
Up to October 24 the directors have paid
the 8-cent advance on sweatbox weight,
amounting to about 3.13 cents on packed
out goods. This has amounted. in money
to about 12,400,000. â¢ The directors are now
arranging to make payments on the bal
ance of the deliveries to date.

The hue and cry is always great that
France is spending too much for her
army and that the sum exceeds that
spent by other countries. Now, since
1S91. the money spent on the army has
decreased every year, and of all the great
European powers FrancÂ© is the one that
spends the least, and the 68S.000.000 francs
would be lessened one-third if the Min
istry of War did not have to pay for the
gendarmerie and the colonial troops, who
have nothing to do with the national de
fense. Statistics prove the while France
spent 1,000.000 francs, Italy spent 2,583,000,
Austria 9,730,000, Germany 18,333,000, Rus
sia 23,000,000 and Great Britain 35,333,000.
The financial position in France shows
that It is the best in Europe, and for the
last twelve years she has 'always been
ready, to lend millions of francs to foreign
cotmtriesfrom a well tilled and ever ' re
plenishing treasury and a statesman said,
while talking of the great : amount '.':; of
money made in "America, "It is; not what
a nation and a man makes that tells; It
is bow they spend and save their money
If a laborer makes S3 a day and spends
the whole of It he is not so well off: as
the one who makes a dollar a day and
saves a quarter of it"-^Brooklyn Eagle
France's Economical Army.

cure the position s held- by.."" Professor

Professor Brooks was seen last evening
and said that he had. no intention of re
tiring in i the near future, and that if he
did decide to retire . he . would not do so
for one year, or possibly for. two years. "I
have served in the city schools for. twen
ty-nine,years, 1 " he said, "and the question
of my retiring from active work has nat
urally been discussed by myself â¢ and -. my

be for a year and it may not be for, two
years." 'â¢;?; ;' ' ; , --;Â¦.,-, . . . :'~-: ;
The rumor that Professor Elisha
Brooks, principal of the Girls' High
School, Intends to resign shortly from his
position Is apparently untrue. For some
days City Hall circles have discussed it
and the further one that School Director
Cecil W. Mark was building his political
fences in order to secure the coveted po
sition.

Fifty years ago the London Times spoke
of telegraphic experiments being made at
Portsmouth. England, with perfect suc

which', with an operating battery on one
side and V dial on the other side a tele
graph message was conveyed through the
water without the aid of connecting wires.
An electric wife ; was submerg ed, : termin

"It is contended that in the same man

How Tolstoi Caught the Lady.
Â£ An . amusing incident occurred during
Tolstoi's recent visit to the Crimea. A
rich American arrived in his yacht, ac
companied by a party of friends, and
asked permission to see the great Rus
sian, who was HI, promising that they
would be content with a glimpse tnd
would not trouble him with talk. Leave
was granted. Tolstoi saf upon his bal
cony, and the whole party of Americans
slowly and silently walked before him.
One lady, however, refused to be boun.i
by the contract She stood still for a
minute and shouted: "Leo Tolstoi, all your
noble writings have had a profound In
fluence upon my life, but the one which
has taught me the most is your " Hero
she forgot the name of the work. The
sick author leaned over 'the rail of tlio
balcony and whispered, with a smile:
"The Dead Souls?" "Yes, yes." she re
plied. "That book," said Tolstoi, "was
written by Gogol, not by me."â Leslie's

to permit it Mr. Jorkins, In fact, says
we have lost so much ourselves in the
transaction that we cannot afford it My

point Mr. Jorkins is immovable. If it

tion to resemblances between the effects
of lightning and those of the electrical
machine for generating sparks. "Wlnckler
next argued for the Identity of the two
kinds of power. Franklin followed up the
argument by experiments in 1745-50. Act
ing under Franklin's Instructions, Doll
bard, in France, on May 10, 1752, obtained
sparks from an iron rod forty feet high
and charged a Leyden jar with electricity.
Franklin did not make his kite experiment
until the 15th of the following June. He
did not then. understand or rightly Inter
pret the experiment which gave him his
electrical reputation.
His experiment excited great interest In
Europe, and while Professor Rlchmann of
St. Petersburg was explaining and demon
strating to a companion the construction
of. some of Franklin's apparatus he was
killed by a large spark discharged from
the machine. *
The v French Academy of Sciences
awarded to ; Mr. Romas the merit of in
venting the electrical kite a year before
It was ; employed by Franklin. The kite
made by Romas was seven and a half
feet high, three feet wide, and had a sur
face of eighteen square feet. .The kite
was ' sent up 650 feet Electrical , sparks
were obtained and shocks of great vio
lence were witnessed. ' ,
In 1753 the Abbe Mazeas, by means of a
wire 870 feet long, attached to a steeple
at Malntenon. proved that electrical action
is excited not only in storms, but In dear/
dry. and especially in hot weather, at all
hours between sunrise and sunset N
First discoverers seldom get things quite
correct -When Columbus discovered land
at the end of his - famous voyage he
thought he had arrived at India, and was
looking out for the . towers of "Fair
Cathay." He never . discovered that his
discovery was not India, but a new con
tinent or the Islands belonging to It.
Two astronomers.. by a lucky miscalcu
lation, both discovered, the planet Nep
tune. The discovery was very hotly dis
cussed. 'Although' if the reasoning of the"
two scientists had been correct : neither
would have found the planet still the
planet happened to be where they thought
it , was, and the world now knows all
about it "
: In . the same w^r Franklin - was away
off in his reasonhig afibut^ electricity,; but
he has been" credited ' with the discovery
of how to bring lightning, down from
heaven. . -
It only remains now. fafr some exploring
philosopher. to prove that the trick of the
ancient â¢; and , mythological â¢ Prometheus Â» In
bringing down - fire from heaven was done
by an " anticipation of :. the f modern : light

ABE ENDEAVORING TO
HAVE PRISONERS PAROLED
"If a' person were confined in a' room
with purple walls, with no color -tout pur
ple around him." we are told, "by the end
of a month he would be a madman." And
no wonder. It is easy to see how a per
son compelled to look for a whole month
at purple walls, purple celling, purple
landscapes, purple cows, purple fountains
and purple bedding, and to partake of
food composed only of Concord grapes,
preserved beets and thin coffee, to write
upon purple paper with violent ink, to
read purple novels and to think purple
thoughts, would get purple in the face,
swear purple words, and get purply mad.
But this is not all of It-
Scarlet is as bad, and its effects are
even worse. It produces a madness that
causes its victims to murder their nearest
friends. Scarlet has a terrible effect even
upon animals. It will drive a bull or a
tiger to desperation. And then there is
blue. Blue Is depressing. It acts like a
drug on the brain. It gives one the mully
grubs. Hence the blues. The effect of
too much blue in your surroundings is ter
rible. Taken in moderation, however, as,
for instance, in the way of huckleberry
pie, it is not so very hurtful.
But greenâ "green is the k(ng or colors."
It Is soothing in its effect, if) not taken in
ternally in the shape of early cucumbers.
It Is balm for the brain and for the eye
sight. Not alone In its singular number,
but in its plural also, as, for Instance,
greens. It is uplifting to the entire system.
Even green apples are not so bad. They
are splendid correctives for thoughtless
boys. The sky is really green, although
it looks blue. The sea Is really green, al
though it seems to take on other hues at
times. Green is so soothing that it helps
the system to fight disease, and therefore,
our authority says, all sick rooms should
be papered or painted green. Sage green
is the most soothing green of all.
Next to green, yellow is the best of col
ors, but. alas! solitary confinement In a
yellow room, particularly if the prisoner
be compelled to read yellow newspapers,
hopelessly wrecks the system and pro
duces hysteria.- The yellow newspapers
have been known to do this, however,
even to persons who have not been In
solitary confinement There may be some
variety, of course, with green for a foun
dation, a little purple here, a dash of
scarlet there; here a flash of yellow/- and
there a dab of blue, would not hurt, but
we cannot be too careful of our minds,
especially If they be weak.
Those who are wrapt up in the home
beautiful movement, we are sure, , will
thank ua for directing their attention to
what seems to be a timely note of warn
ing sounded by'the'eurrent issue of Medi
cal Talk for the Home. According to this
authority, the prevailing fad for red
rooms, blue rooms, yellow rooms, green
rooms, etc.. Is likely to lead to sad re
sults unless subjected to intelligent direc
tion and restraint. The influence of color
upon the human mind Is so strong, It
seems, that Ipnorant and careless persons
are liable, while making the home beauti
ful, to wreck some <Jf the noblest intel
lects beneath its roof. Purple, for ex
ample, is put down as a most dangerous
color, its effect upon the gray matter of
those coming under Its constant influence
being of a disturbing and even of a fatal
character.

Scai-let Excite* to

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
Desquesnes is not so difficult as it looks.
Dekane would pass muster, and you may
also come across Dekann. Regarding
Charteris and Sandys, you will win ap
proval in high society if you stick . to
Charters and Sands; and those individuals
known as Jervis, Berkeley. and Derby like
to hear the first "eV. tarried Into "ah."
Why, It is difficult to say.
Spare a Welshman's feelings by saying
Aberganny, and not.Abergavenny, and, if
possible, don't attempt to pronounce
Amwich. If you are English it is beyond
you. A fairly successful way is to start
with "Am" and leave : the rest to luck.
If you are going to Dolgelly: for your
holidays, ask for a ticket to Dolgethly;
and if you are a cyclist, don't inquire the
way to. Llanelly. If : you ; do, you .will
probably never get" there. The rustic
would Vbite" at Llanethly, however.
Don't think of some dimunitive maiden
when you speak of/,Wemyss; "call, it
Weems " and you - may be taken for a
Scotchman; and if you are over the bor
der, don't ; forget that Kirkcudbright is
pronounced, Kurcoobree.
- The- celebrated : news agency is called
Roiter's not Rooter's; 1 and the produce of
flve finger exercises for budding musicians
â Czernyâ Is called Chernee. That famous
Italian, Boccaccio, was simply known as
Bok-kart-cho. not half ? bo disturbing as
the number of "o's" would suggest .'Â¦
There is no need to look up Beauchamp;
it Is merely a playful rendering, of the'fa
mous maker of pills. Duchesne has such
an awe-inspiring appearance it is a pity
we must pronounce it Dukarn. Heathcote
is shortened into Hethcut, and Dlllwyn
has quite an Irish flavor when pronounced
Dillon. - -
Some people are much annoyed if they!
art not addressed in .' their own special I
way. Mr. St. John likes to be called Sin Jin '
but as a geographical term he doc:i not
mind you saying Saint John. Anstruther is
doubtful," but often shortens into Anster.
The "Macs" also are very susceptible re
garding, their surnames. If you want to
be friends with McLeod and Maclean, call
them Makloud and Maklane, and if you |
have intentions regarding Mr. Strachan's j
daughter, don't call him Strakan'if you
value your chances, but Strawn. Follow
ing these good intentions, you must'ad
dress Beauclerk as-Beauclare and Beau
volr as Beever. j
In case you ever move In ambassadorial !
circles or make friends on the Riviera, i
don't forget the Baron de Longuevllle Is |
called Loneveal. M. St. Cyr will answer i
you if you say Sanseer, and Strous would j
be a good rendering of the name of the j
eminent composer of waltzes. Markyar- j
velee will be. as near as you can get to '
Machiavclli. but possibly. you may, be able
to avoid this distinguished personage.
A couple of "Saints" are rather puz
zling. St. Clair should be rendered Sin
clair, and if â¢ you would, win a smile of
approval pronounce St. Leger Bellinger or
Selleger."
We usually laugh at the foreigner's ef
forts to master the pronunciation of our
mother tongue, but most of us are nqt
without doubt when we come to pro
nounce certain proper nouns. Any number
of surnames and geographical names re
ceive as many as four different render
ings, and it is quite possible to persuade
any, one that his or her way is' not the
correct one." Some surnames are so mal-.
treated as to be quite unrecognizable
from the spelling. No wonder the average
individual finds an English dictionary in
dispensable. V
Probably the most remarkable quartet
are Colqohoun, Marjorlbanks, Cholmonde
ley and Bagehot. ~They look much less
impressive when spelled" as pronounced-p
Cohoon, Marshbanks, Chumley and BaJoC.
Phonetic spelling deprives many names of j
their terrors. That awful name/ Geoghe- j
gan would become simply Gagan;" Ruth- |
ven would be Riven,' and Cockburn Ko- j
burn. !

1 Suit for (25,000 damages was begun to
day against S. T. Alexander, the Ha
waiian sugar king, by A. J. Fulmer, a
tenant of Alexander, who alleges I that
he has been falsely imprisoned and also
robbed of his good name thrpugh the ac
tion of Alexander and his foreman,
George W. Burtner. Fulmer alleges that
Alexander, becoming dissatisfied with a
bargain he made with him in regard to
the purchase of a ranch in Shasta Coun
ty, used unusual means to gain his ends.
The action is based upon the arrest of
Fulmer by the alleged connivance of the
defendant, Alexander, on November 30,
1902. Fulmer says he leased a ranch in
Shasta County from Alexander with an
option of buying it for $13,000. Afterward,
he eays, Alexander became dissatisfied
with the arrangement and tried to have
his foreman. Burtner, oust him forcibly
from the premises.
Fulmer says that he saw an attorney
In regard to the matter, who told him
what his rights were and advised him. to
stand his grounds. "When Burtner called
the second time, he resented the intru
sion and drove him off his land. The
next Sunday, while on his way to church,
Fulmer was seized by the Constable and
handcuffed and taken to Anderson Jail.
He says he was humiliated before his
acquaintances and in support of his al
legation of animus eays that when the
case came up before the Justice of the
peace for. the preliminary hearing, no one
appeared to prosecute him" and he was
discharged.

the Lake Superior Consolidated Company,
was a little boy in Maine, playing about
the lumber wharves in Bangor, he gave
promise of his ability at financiering, his

WHEAT â The foreign markets continue quiet
and not materially changed.
Chicago was higher, but cables were unre
sponsive and the world's shipments large. The
Flour market was active, all mills reporting a
blÂ£ buctine&8. . â¢ Â¦ Â¦ -
The Chicago report of Bolton, de Ruyter &
Co. said: "As heretofore when - the market
has turned strong, there is a good deal of bull
ish sentiment and a good deal of bullish talk.
We do not ourselves, however, see any mate-
rlal change from those which have . controlled
prices during the recent past. Primary re
ceipts are practically the eame as a year ago
and the export demand is less. Another large
Increase in the visible is likely on. Monday,
World's shipments will be about' 12,000,000
bushels. With these, coming every week and
with the favorable Argentine crop prospects
we are very skeptical about Europe following
any advance here, and unless they do, the ad
vance cannot be maintained. There Is more or
less talk of a lighter movement in the North
west, but every fall we hear the tame thing, Â¦
and the Wheat usually keeps coming. If noth
ing else brings It, the premiums In the North
western markets are very likely to do so. Ex
port business for the day Is small, but Minne
apolis reports a large trade in flour, partly
for exoort." â '

unchanged aa to cash grain. Considerable

To the person who knows nothing about
bees they represent the supreme type of
industry. But even the bee communities
are disturbed by those of their own kind
who break through and steal. Robber
bees are always a source of anxiety to
beekeepers, and at this time of year the
marauders seem particularly active. Hav
ing gathered no honey, or. at any rate,
an insufficient supply for themselves, they
will descend upon a hive, kill its indus
trious occupants and carry off the golden
treasure in an astonishingly short spara
of time. "We know of a recent instance in
which the attack was developed and the
home bees' killed in a couple of hours.
Sometimes hive will attack nelshborinR
hive. In such cases the old straw "skip"'
was better than the modern arrangement,
for a knife thrust through the top would
break the comb and set the honey free, at
which the thieves would instantly return
to seal up their own, store. It is not pri
marily in their industry that bees are
human.â London Chronicle.
Hobber Bees.

Thfl continued wet weather had a depressing
effect on the fruit market and trade, which is
usually brisk on Saturday, was very quiet.
Berries did a little better under moderate re
ceipts, but all kinds of tree fruits were in free
supply and prices stood as previously quoted.
Fresh arrivals of Grapes were light, but there
waa an abundance of carried-over stock on
hand. There was. some little Inquiry for choice
stock In crates for shipment on tho Portland
steamer, but supplies were too heavy to permit
any advance In prices. The Apple market was
In good shape and' fancy stock was steady.
Dealers were still asking $2 25 per box for fine
Spltzenbergs from Oregon and Humboldt Coun
ty. Choice Winter Nellis Pears were In limited
supply and firm, while common offerings were
Â¦plentiful and dull.' Figs and Nutmeg Melons
were still on the market, but. attracted very lit
tle attention.. Pomegranates, Persimmons and
Quinces wero plentiful and In fair request.
The feature of the Citrus market was the ar
rival of a car of new crop Navels from Porter
yille. The fruit was of good quality and size,
but lacked color and found no buyers. . Other
wise there wan nothing new to report.

Numerous other considerations might be
cited to .show that, whether it be practica
ble or not to attain 100 miles an hour in a
burst of speed, it is npt practicable on
railways carrying a general traffic to run
trains at speeds very much in excess of
the highest now attained. If trains are
to be run at 100 miles an hour, then.it
must be on a road built for them alocc,
from which all other traffic Is excluded.
Numerous attempts have been made to
show that such a railway" would be a
paying enterprise, but the capitalists have
never been convinced. The mere fact
that the Germans have attained over 100
miles an hour on their experimental road,
therefore, proves nothing as to the prac
ticability of adopting such speeds.âEngi
neering News. .---â¢-
But trains are run a large share of the
time when the signal cannot bo made out
at 1000 feet, or anything like that distance.
They are often run when a semaphore
cannot be clearly seen till one Is within,
say, 200 feet. Under such conditions the
engine runner would have Just one and
one-half seconds to decide whether hia
train were dashing: on to safety or de
struction-
IUis well known that If trains are to be
run with safety under tho block signal
system the spacing of the distant signal
from the home must be proporUoned to
the speed of the fastest trains. "The dis
tant signal tells the engine runner that
the home signal stands at danger and
that he must stop his train before reach
ing it. and the faster tho train is running
the further back must this information
be given him. With present train speed3
it la not uncommon to place the distant
signal 2S00 feet back of the home; and if
this is a proper distance for stxty-mile-an
hour trains, then for 100 miles an hour
the distant signal ought to be placed at
least 7500 feet back. ,
The German engineers are spending a
large amount of time ana money on expe
riments -whose aim is the production of an
electric or steam locomotive which can
run 100 miles an hour. According to a
cable dispatch they succeeded last week
for the first time In reaching 100 miles an
hour speed; but the question which natu
rally suggests Itself to railway engineers
In the United States Is. who wants to
travel at 6uch speeds? Side by side with
the speed records of this German experi
ment we would set the discussion which
took place on the location of distant sig
nals at the recent meeting of the Railway
Signaling Club, reported in our last issue.
The signal engineer of a leading rail
road there stated that he had not been
ablo to work satisfactorily a mechanical
signal with a greater length of wire than
2000 feet.
The New German lOO-Mile-an-Hour
Trolley Said to Be Im
practicable.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Nov. 14.â There was a good com
mission house demand for wheat and the mar
ket ruled firm after a slightly easier open
ing. Continued favorable weather In face of
predictions as to the contrary and rather dis
appointing cables caused some selling at the
start, and Initial 6ales of December were un
changed to V4c lower at 70%@76%c. Outside
markets were all higher, however, and this
fact soon resulted fn creating a better senti
ment here. Minneapolis reported sales of flour
there yesterday and excellent demand for cash
wheat, and in consequence the Northwest mar
ket showed decided strength. Cash demand
here was also good. Neyw York reported the
December option strong and prices at St.
Louis showed big gains. All these Influences
were factors in causing a better demand. De
cember sold up to 7~Mc, closing at 77H@
77 He, a gain of *J@'?8C.
Corn bad to contend with weather condi
tions which were most favorable for curing
the new crop. December closed *4@Vic lower
at 42Hc.
Oats ruled steady on a fair demand from
commission house and shorts. December
clceed a shade lower at 53%c. . i
Provisions were firm, with a good deal of
covering by local shorts in evidence. Buying
of lard wae the feature. January pork and
ribs closed Fc higher, lard was 2^ic higher
and ribs uo re - v V

--Chicago was slightly lower, but showed a
better undertone, with light receipts of Hogs.
This market continued quiet. â¢
The Chicago report of Bolton. de Ruyter &
Co. said: "After a long season of dullness and
decline, ' the action of the market and Its gen
eral tone are, we think, better. Stocks are not
large. Receipts of hogs are considerably below
lapt year and the rather inferior quality doea
not Indicate that they are being held because
of unsatisfactory prices. Cash demand Is fairly
good, and for Lard particularly good. Packertj
have succeeded In working down the price ! oi
live Hcgs to where further efforts lrt that direc
tion cannot to any great extent be profitably
pursued. Think they are more likely to look
for the profits on the higher prices of products.
Think we would rather buy proYislons on the
weak spots."

Felt Sale With Franklin.
In the middle of the severe electrical
storm of a recent Sunday afternoon a re
serve policeman, at Ninth and Chestnut
streets, found a young negro boy shiver
ins and wet to the skin clinging to the
base of the Ftanklln statue in front of
the Postofflce building. The street was
deserted by everybody else. The police
man went up to the lad and asked him
why he was standing out in the rain.
The little fellow replied: "Gee. boss, I'se
orfully afeared of llghtnln*. and Franklin
lnvenshuned the llghtnln*, didn't he? Di3
am de safest place foh dia chicken."
The policeman passed on.â Philadelphia

speech In England that "In no eountry Is
it so true that there are only three gen
erations between ihlrt sleeves and shirt
sleeves. We have no laws of, prtmogenl
uzre'to-keep tha fortune In the family ;

The fact.- however, is substantiated by
thorough Investigation that not one cf
the big millionaire families cf New York
ox America has returned to tha shirt- i
eleeve stage.
Chauncey M. Depew has seen five gen
erations of VanderbUtsâ "the" commo

G wynne and the baby. While there are j
no laws by which a multi-millionaire

J.*D. BOCKEFEXiEE-'S ESTATE.
At the present rate of the concentration
of wealth, in fifty years fifty families will
own the value of fully one-half of the
United States, and the billionaire will
have arrived long before the passage of
that period.
In the race for ten figures the Rocke
fellers have a long lead, and If John D.
Rockefeller Jr. lives and carries out the
plans cf his father fce*wlll probably win
the race.
The Rockefeller wealth Is now estimated
fat H00.00O.CCO. The only rival to the oil
! king wu the steel king, Andrew Carne
gie, who took ofi his crown at COO.WO.QOO.
of which amount he has given away one
third. But Andrew Carnegie has no son,
one little daughter only having been born
to him. His close friends say he would
have acted different had a son been born
to carry on the name at which the steel
king Is so proud. v
John D. Rockefeller Jr. \3 being trained
by his father to rule the Standard Oil
trust so that there may be no break in
tne management at the time of the pa
rents* death. While the Rockefeller girls
will not be forgotten, they will receive
only a few millions apiece. They have
married well, are proud of their father
and acquiesce in his plan to make his
namesake his chief heir.
John D. Rockefeller Jr. has never been
pampered by his father. In college days
"he spent no more than the son of one of
his father's clerks, and he became* a clerk
himself. Until he showed that he wa3 his
father's own boy In the way of finance
he was kept on a small monthly allow
ance. To show what a good boy he was
he kept within the appropriation,
THE ASTOB ESTATE.
The Astors represent . the oldest of
American families of wealth and the idea
of primogeniture has been carried through
! the many years since the first John Jacob
I Astor covered up his shirt sleeves. At
( present there Is no indication that any
member of the family is about to take
off his coat.
The heads of the two branches of the
familyâ "William Waldorf and John Ja
cobs â have pooled their issues at times,
notably in . the case of the Waldorf-As
toria HoteL William Waldorf, the Eng
lishman, is rated at $lj6.â¬a>,CGa. John Ja
cob at JlS^OO.fiCOâ all In Xew York realty.
The heir of William Waldorf Astor
bears the name of his father. He is *l
years old. Next to hfra comes Pauline
and then John Jacob. On the American
side of the family John Jacob has one
son onlyâ William Vincent Astor. now 11.
but the coming Astors are William W.
'and William V.. and together they will
[represent SZX*,<>XO,GCQ of land wealth.
THE GOX3XD ESTATE.
Jay Gocld had one central idea in mak*
lag hl3 will, and that was to keep the
money in the family and make his eldest
son. George J. Gould, the manager of the
estate. This has been done, and could
the shade of the founder of the Gould
family revisit the earth it wotild see that
the plan has worked admirably, in the
main.
William C. Whitney has coÂ£ waited for
dissolution to pass aiocgr his tiOX'JQ&Q to
Harry Payne "Whitney, but has given its
management to him while he could di
rect him as to the best uses to which that
fortune could be pot. t
When Mr. Whitney announced that he
would retire from business he added that
his son would be his successor. One by
one the father's directorships have been
transferred to the son. Although "William
C. "Whitney keeps & sharp eye on things,
his son is virtually in charge of the Whlt
new interests.
J. P. M0BGAITS ESTATE.
The most clnsire of all the millionaires
Is John Pierpont Morgan. It la impossi
ble to give any estiz&ate of - his ' wealth,
because, to? one reason, he does not pile
It up, but keeps It moving. *HIa great
power 13 hla control cf other people's
money and of this he has core than any
other man in the world. Mr. Morgan Is
a potent factor in the administration of
properties amounting to S4,C00JJG0,CQ0
Mr. Morgan has trained hi3 son* and
namesake, his only boy, to carry on the
great backing business by and with the
assistance of a host cf ,partners. The
third generation appeared In 1S92 In the
person of Jonios Spencer Morgan. -
Edward H. R. Green will . Inherit ' the

"Dan" R. Han&a has the confidence of

! Golden GatÂ© Circle of . the "Women of
Woodcraft has arranged an "at hornÂ©' 'to
be given on next Friday evening in thÂ©
Women of Woodcraft.
j Owing to lack of work in the School De
partmaat repair shop the Board of Edu
cation yesterday notified the Board of
Public Works that It will be obliged to
dispense with the services of two paint
em, two carpenters, three helpers and
three plumbers, thÂ© same to take effect
at once.
Lays Off Tea "Workmen.
The board is of the opinion that some
Â¦ort of action should be taken In the case,
es It fears that the discipline of the de
partment will suffer unless something is
done. The majority of the board Is disin
clined to take drastic measures against
Miss Murray, as it is believed that she
used the objectionable language regard-
Ing Mrs. Ostrom under stress of great ex
citement. The school directors, however,
feel that an apology at least Is due from
Miss Murray to Mrs. Ostrom. and In that
â¢vent the Incident in all probability will
be closed.
The exclusive publication In yesterday's
Call of the story that Miss Elizabeth
Murray, assistant supervisor of drawing,
had threatened Mrs. L D. Ostrom, a
teacher in the Fremont School, with bodi
ly violence, created a sensation In school
circles. One important point that was
Inadvertently omitted In the article was
the fact that Miss Murray acknowledged
*rterward to the entire board that she
had used the offensive language which
President Woodward first heard.
Tbe board fears that If a rehearing Is
printed to Mrs. Greenan such action will
have the effect of restoring her to her
standing In the department, as otherwise
â¢the board would have no jurisdiction over
her. In that event Mrs. Greenan would
thaw salary without any corresponding
*ervlees. The point is a fine one and may
be referred to the City Attorney for ad
judication. In the meantime the board
Brill issue notices to the parents and oth
ers interested In the case to appear on
fome date yet to be designated and show
cause why Mrs. Greenan should not be
granted a rehearing. Should the prepon
derance of evidence on that point be
against Mrs. Greenan, then the board
would feel Justified in not granting her
petition.
MISS MTJBBAY TO APOLOGIZE.
OBJECT TO BETBIAX.
Another former principal against whom
certain parents have objected to the
board is Mrs. Rebecca Greenan, ex-prin
cipal of the John W. Taylor School, who
has petitioned for a rehearing of the
t harg^E upon which she was dismissed
from the department some two years agro.
Several parents of pupils of the school
named waited on the board Friday and
forcefully oppostd the granting of Mrs.
Greenan's petition. They argued that the
matter had been disposed of and should
be allowed to rest.
The parents of pupils attending the
South End School have filed a petition
with Superintendent of Schools Langdon
requesting that Mips Jean A. Dwyer, act
ing principal of the school, be removed
from her position. Miss Dwycr was re
cently accorded a public hearing on a
charge of having severely punished a
pupil and the Board of Education has the
case under consideration and is expected
to render a decision in a few days.
With the evident desire to prevent a
decision favorable to Miss Dwyer the pa
rents to the number of twenty-five have
appealed that she be transferred to some
other ephere of usefulness in order that
peace may descend on the school. In
their petition the parents allege that
MIfs Dwyer's trial demonstrated that she
is possessed of an ungovernable temper
and that it would be for the best inter
ests of the pupils that she be removed.
The Board of Education is in a quan
dary as to what disposition to make of
the case. Miss Dwyer is only an acting
principal and is destined to retire from
the place on the return of thÂ© regular
principal. Miss I. E. Coles, who Is now oa
a leave of absence, and will assume her
duties et the beginning of the new year.
It is understood that Director Woodward
does not think that Miss Dwyer should
be harshly dealt with on the cruelty
cliarge. while Director Roncovieri thinks
otherwise. Directors Mark and Walsh
are non-committal, but it Is quite within
the bounds of likelihood that there will
be a deadlock when the matter comes to
a vote.
Assistant Supervisor of Drawing
Murray May Have to Apologize
to Teacher Whom She
Threatened.

The Mutual Company is in the field to
stay, said Mr. Keefe, is in a prosperous
condition and is not for sale, especially to
the Portland concern.'
The feeling of every member is that the
trust will carry Its bluff into execution.
Daniel F. Keefe, manager of the Mutual
combination, has declared . that the big
trust Is circulating, j rumors that the
smaller concern has. offered to sell to Its
competitor solely for the purpose of dis
couraging the stockholders. Mr. Keefe,
in speaking, for his* company, says that a
slash In prices ' would help the local deal
ers. "'':Â¦'Â¦ '- ; \ â¢Â¦Â¦ ,--LL^- 1:... '".
The Mutual Company Is composed of
local grocers and was organized for the
one purpose of fighting the trust in Its
heavy raise In prices.
A dispatch from Portland was published
yesterday stating that the Impending bat
tle would be directed against the Mutual
Biscuit Company of this city and would
be fought until the local" concern was
forced to the wall.
The threat made by the Pacific Coast
Biscuit Company, the headquarters of
which Is at Portland. Or., that It would
slash prices and wage war with San
Francisco dealers Is looked upon by local
grocers as a big bluff on the part of the
combine. -â¢'":'

PARIS, Nov. 14.â A competition opened
by two Paris newspapers, the Matin and
the Journal, to find treasures in the
shape of medals and tubes containing
sums of money, is becoming * a craze.
Thousands throng the public parks and
squares and devastate the flower beds
in search of the treasures. There was a
riot in front of one ofilce Sunday, a crowd
declaring that a man who had found a
treasure was really an emissary of the
paper. The Petit Parisian's offer of 250,000
francs in prizes to persons who guess the
number and weight of grains of wheat In
a bottle permitted a smart Parisian to net
a nice sum by hiring out for 50 centimes
(10 cents) a bottle, which he declared was
similar to the Petit Parisian's bottle.

very high and mighty indeed.
Dr. Sylvester has a big house in Berlin
in the most fashionable quarter, near the
Thlergarten, where he has big flunkeys in
gorgeous knee breeches to open the doors
and usher you in upon magnificence. One
room after another stretches before you,
each one seeming to be as grand as it
could be and filled with as beautiful fur
niture and ornaments as you ever saw
in a private house. And in each one there
are gifts which the Kaiser or some mem
ber of the Imperial family has given the
dentist. To the persons whom he wants
to honor the most, the Kaiser gives a
marble or bronze bust of himselfâ and he
has given Dr. Sylvester three or four of
these keepsakes.

without ceremony. One day, when he

palace and the Prince saw him from the

And it seems to cave been an accepted
fact that an American fills the bill much

recognized in Europe as being the best in

It is true also that an American dentist

In Vienna there has been for many
years an American dentist. Dr. E. W.

ITALIAN OPERA SINGERS FORGET THEIR TRIALS FOR AN AFTERNOON AND INDULGE IN THEIR NA
TIVE DELICACIES AT A BOHEMIAN RESORT IN THE LATIN QUARTER, WHERE THEY EAT, DRINK
AND TALK SHOP.
Let one ask the foVeign actor wherein
he considers lies the chief basis of hopÂ©
for the American drama and he will in
variably reply: "In your excellent stock
theaters," not only as the nearest ap
proach to the subsidized people's theaters
of Europe, therefore the chief means of
educating the popular taste, not only as
schools of actingâ the best now obtain
able, but also as the most valuable out
let for the energies of the American
dramatist. E. S. Wlllard has lately been
expressing himself on the subject in Lon
don, with a large meed of praise for the
work of stock companies. There is evi
dent, comically, a pretty jealousy of Wil
lard's favorable opinion of American
dramatic conditions in the London papers,
by the way. They "get even" by hoping
hopelessly "that America has not coarsen
ed tho art of one of the most polished
actors on the English stage"â as they pro
fessed to find it had done in the case of
Mrs. Campbell.
Certainly it had not done so when Mr.
Willard was here to any appreciable ex
tentâwhich, however, is neither here nor
there." What is to tho point is that to the
actor's possibly vitiated taste the Amer
ican stock company is a most hopeful and
admirable feature of American dramatic
life, and our local Lyceum, the Alcazar,
an excellent example of the class, as Mr.
Willard said while here. Ben Greet said
the same thing, with admiring iteration.
There was little that the famous London
manager missed during his recent visit
here. From the Chinese drama to the Bo
hemian Club play, "Montezuma," Mr.
Greet was to be found everywhere where
his art was concerned. But first and last
the actor-manager instanced the Alcazar
and the Tlvoli as the most remarkable
features of local theatrical life. For the
work of the Alcazar, in particularâ being
himself more concerned with dramatic
than with operatic mattersâ the manager
expressed both respect and 'surprised" ad
miration; for the resourcefulness, enter
prise, energy of the company,' that pro
duced adequately, week by week, new
plays drawn from the best dramatic liter
ature, and including j almost every phase
of it. And Mr. Greet has a trifle of
twelve companies himself.
I think the London manager would be
even more pleased with the company now

first brought out in the United States last
year at the Criterion Theater, in New
York, where it was booked for four weeks,
but it. soon became so. popular that Miss
Harned's engagement was extended there
for almost five months. "Iris" is a prob

others. Miss Harned cornea to San Fran

had seated himself by me. â¢

Travaglini Interrupted his stately peri
ods with: "If you want to say anything
come to me. I say it for you!"
"He Jork much, very comic," Benedetto
laughed. Then with her gracious little
bow said: "Win you now excuse me? I
must go to rest for this evening. We
have been very glad to have you here."
Pasquale appeared beaming a moment
later in a brilliant collar and the freshest
of ties. I wish I could do Justice either
to them or to Don Pasquale's bow. He
is a comedian born, and the little inci
dent so impossible In an Anglo-Saxon set
ting was only amusing among these de
lightfully un-self-conscious Latins.
Mme. Cortesi was meanwhile supplying
every one bountifully, and as she brought
in some broiled steak and Implored me
to eat It, "for it make you very strong,"
Gregoretti arrived.
The famous baritone looked tired and
was. He has sung every week since he
came, and there had been a long and tir
ing rehearsal of "Zaza," which is new to
all the singers. He came up to shake
hands, and welcomed me in elaborate
English.
"I am so sorry," I stammered.
"All right; very good; I lak it," ap
proved his wife, who was trimness itself
in her neat blue gown, v.ith its white

And I simply couldn't explain.
"No good?" he laughed, and pointed to
his neck. He has the merriest laugh
imaginable.
Thinking he meant the collar, I said
emphatically. "No, no cood!"
But Don Pasquale Jumped up from the
table and vanished in a twinkling into an
inner room.
"Yes, a place where one can take off
one's collar," I put it, then discovered
miserably .that Don Pasquale's plump
neck was collarless!
"No, Italian now," Benedetto contra
dicted gracefully. The soprano has a very
pretty and tactful fashion of compliment.
Then after a "Thank you, Carlotta." for
her black coffee, she began to tell me
in her pretty lingo how Cortesi's was

"Good man. not boy," corrected Bene
detto prettily, and she looked over kindly
at the "boy tenor."

brum-brummed again, then said: "It was

Ischierdo commented: "They think al

â¢Poor Travaglini!" said Pasquale, and
explained to me: "He was in big crowd
at Sutter street, and one look In his face
last night and steal him 53."
"In Awstrawly (Australia) once also,"
Travaglini added: "I sing there many
month?, at Christmas."
"Is there much merry-making at Christ
mas in Italy?" I asked.
"Good time," said Benedetto, smiling
tenderly at her memories.
"Eat big," Travaglini added, with a jov

There might have been all the time in
the world from the leisurely fashion In
which the artists were discussing the
menu. Cortesi told me afterward that
they not seldom ate and talked from 2 un
til 5 o'clockâ worthy descendants of an
cient Rome! Neither is it a matter of half
e.n hour. look you. to wander through a
menu of the Cortesi kind, as nearly as I
tan - remember, including these things:
Salmon salad, 6oup, sliced raw ham,
stewed chicken, broiled steak, boiled beef,
peperone. Tag-llarinl, spinach, cake, fruit,
coffee, Chianti and apricot brandy, of
which all are expected to partake not
only once but twice, or even three times.
Benedetto, who sang Leonora in the
evening, took only soup and steak. "That
is. best for the voice," she explained, look-
"Two o'clock was the hour set, as the
t-ingers dine then and eat no more until
Bfter the, performance in the evening.
Two o'clock accordingly found the artist

the door opened. A kind-eyed, bare

however, to our explanations, and we took
our way up the stairs, led through the
corridors at the top by the warm and
tpiced odors of the cooking.
Mine host was not In evidence, and the
lady of the door looked bewildered as we
again explained our presence. But there
was the sightly and fragrant steam issu
ing from a kitchen, spacious and darkly
rich, to the left of us, and the
round Italian laughter and clink of
knives and forks from the door fac
ing us. We were certainly at "Cortesi's,"
and not to be deterred. At length one of
the diners came out, and and I discovered
our f ri< nd of the door was Mme. Cortesiâ
familiarly "Carlotta"â and "not used to
the English." A moment more and we
were at the table in the tunny dining
room, the center of hearty greetings.
Ccrtesi himself had not arrived, neither
Gregoretti, nor Travaglini, the "Zaza"
rehearsal claiming them. Mme. Bene
detto, plump and placid, headed the table.

madame smilingly explained. was
"very bad." "Carlotta" waited on her
guests with an ever ready quip and smile,

was a little disappointed that Cortesi him
self had not done the cooking, for he Is
us good a chef as he is a Beppo in "Fra

S "Had any ripple of vanity ever stirred
the calm depths of this woman's soul?
It was doubtful. One might Imagine tho
youthful, strong Maxine Elliott fifteen
years back gazing into her mirror, indif
ferently estimating her loveliness as a
possible factor In the. assets of a future
stage career. It is conceivable, too, that
she may have graciously smiled at the
rapturous admiration of a lover. But tho

" 'It is no help for a woman at the be

a so-called stage beauty. It challenges

" 'If,' she continued, 'the young actress

any beauty In the world, but their beauty

the founding of the Theatrical Manners'
Association, though the need of such a
society had before been freauently and
painfully demonstrated. Before the asso

The musical season in New York opened
on Friday evening last, when Hermann
Wetzler gave his first orchestral concer*.
which was also the debut In this country
of Jacques Thibaud, the celebrated
French violinist. The latter was heard fan
the Mozart and Saint-Saens concertos,
and before he had played many bars it
was evident .that he was worthy of the
great praise that had preceded him and
that he is an artist of the first rank. Per
sonally Thibaud is tall and slender, with
long hair hanging from either side of his
head and cut square at the end, after the
style of the old masters. His manner is
easy, natural, unembarrassed, yet unas
sumingâthe pose of an artist who Is sure
of himself. In addition, he is extremely
good looking.
His playing has polish, delicacy and
beauty of tone. "In the Saint-Saens con
certo he was the brilliant technician." said
the New York Tribune; "nervous, energet
ic, firm, masterful, holding the elements
of his art in a conquering grasp. In the
Mozart concerto he was the poetic inter
preter of an exquisite artistic proclama
tion, swayed by lovely and lofty emo
tions. His tone is true and pure. Tha
best oroof of the genius of Thibaud is
that he seems more anxious to win af
fection than to compel amazement and
this is one of the finest proofs of genlu3."
Thibaud's debut was an auspicious open- '*
Ing of the musical season. He is an
nounced for his first recital In Carnegie
Hall on November 20. Before that, how
ever, he is to play with the Xew York
Philharmonic Society at their first brace
of concerts on November 13 and 14, when
he is to play the Lalo concerto under tho
direction of Edouard Colonne, the fam
ous Parisian conductor, who was tha
first to discover the genius of Thibaud.
while this latest idol of the New York
public was playing in a cafe of tho Latin
quarter of Paris some eight years ago.

Carl Reinecke, the amiable and charm- .
ing composer, has recently paid a very
pretty compliment to a local musician, Sir
Henry Heyman. A few days ago Sir
Henry received a small roll of music from
Leipzig that turned out to be a "Ro
raanze" for violin and piano by Relnecke.
Sir Henry was naturally pleased with thÂ©
attention, but a little puzzled as to Its
particular bearing. Further examination,
however, revealed the pretty fact that
Relnecke had dedicated the "Romanze"
to his San Francisco friend. In memory
of a little talk the two had had eight long
years ago. At that time Sir Henry was
ip Leipzig and a visitor one evening at
Relnecke's house. They were talking mu
sic, inevitably, and the local man asked
Relnecke why he did not write somthing
for the violin that the average violinist
might look at without winking. This was
apropos of gome then new and difficult
violin movements by the composer. Rei
necke replied that he supposed the thlng3 ;
were difficult, and that some day \ig%
would "see." That he has "seen" ap
pears from the "Romanze," a graceful
and musical fancy that lies easily under
tho fingers, and better, the veteran writer
â Reinecke is 73 years oldâ has charmingly
shown that he has not forgotten tha Uttla
chat that perhaps led to its writing.

This is not moant for a temperance lec

self in a bad light on the Del Monte flyer
recently by pulling out a cigarette case.
Of course, she only glanced at the cigar
ettes and replaced them in the bag with
other things; but it gave those who did
not know her a bad impression. Some
gentleman (?) attracted by the cigarette
case looked her over. You know men,
for some unaccountable reason, think
they have a right to stareâ usually to
their heart's discontent. As she settled
down comfortably and crossed her feet
he noticed that her stockings were red,
with clocking at the sides. A few days
later he met some one he had seen before.
It was she of the red stockings, and upon
learning her name the first impression
made upon him was corrected

A stimulant only increases the blood
