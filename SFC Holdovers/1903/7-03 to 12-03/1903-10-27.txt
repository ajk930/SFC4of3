In sympathy with the present views of

er with the fact that your niece and her
mother received less than was expected,
seems to have influenced that branch of
the family to attempt to defeat the plain

Disappointment can also account for the
half-brother's willingness to defeat the
will, but as my proposed arrangement
gives you practically as much as yoa
could secure by attacking the $50,00!) (I
voluntarily offered you the income on
about $20,000, as long as you needed It

say, you could profit bat little.

his rifle was never discharged. He also
states that he did not hear a single shot

SANTA ROSA, Oct. 28.â Justice of the
Peace R. B. Brown of Redwood township
has been arrested on a warrant sworn to
by District Attorney Charles H. Pond on
a charge of manslaughter. This is the
outcome of the killing of a man named
Patrick Weir or Patrick O'jHara at
Guernevllle recently, when three armed
men were attempting to arrest him.
Weir was asleep when he was shot, and
the evidence taken at the coroner's In
quest showed that he had no chance for
hl3 life. Weir had had a few words one
afternoon with Charles Hanson, and the
latter swore to a warrant for his arrest.
Brown, although not clothed with author
ity to make an arrest, started out to find
the man named In the warrant. Hanson
accompanied Brown and they also se
cured the assistance of Elisha Shortridge.
All of these. men were armed, and when
they came upon Weir he was asleep on a
bed of straw In an abandonod cabin in
Oregon Canyon. After the shooting Weir
staggered to the door and fell, begging
the men to take him to a doctor. Ho died

SHERIDAN", Or., Oct. 26.â Three rob
bers blew cpen the vault in the banking
house of 6crog-gins &. Wortman here this
morning at 3 o'clock, secured $7000 in gold,
silver and bank jK)tes and then escaped
while the . ayor of the town emptied a
rifle in the direction of their retreat. The
fcardlts are supposed to be the same men
who la Ft -week made a desperate attempt
to loot the bank at Kewbergr. thirty miles
from here, arjj who kept the aroused citi
zens of that place at bay with rifles.
The bank here is situated In a brick
building In the center of town and was
established twelve years ago. The prin
cipal depositors are the' farmers of the
surrounding country. The robbers took
the most opportune hour for their work;,
as the town was deep in slumber and en
veloped in a dense fog. No wntchmah
was on duty. &s there never has been any
reed of guarding property.
The quiet manner in which the men
worked enabled them to force the front
3oors of the bank f and drill a hole near
the combination sufficiently large to in
sert a charge of giant powder. This
rharge was heavy enough to blow the
3oor of the Fafe from its hinges, but did
not wreck the building.
The shock of the explosion awakened
Mayor E. H. Eakin. who resides over h!s
Â«=torc. diagonally across the street from
ihe hank. At first he was in doubt as to
the cause of his sudden awakening, but,
upon looking from his window, saw a
man standing a short distance from the
Dank. Just as Eakin noticed a bright
light showing through the fog from the
Sank building the man. who was evidently
Â¦tanfiir.K puarn. quickly joined two cora
par.ions^nd the entire party jumped into
a vehicle "Jujd^ started to drive toward the
louth. ,
In an instant the Mayor realized that
the bank had been robbfd. He grabbed a
rifie end fired thrfe 'shots at the men as
;hey disappeared down the road. The fir
tXK of the rifle and the screams of Mrs.
Eakin quickly rous<-d the citizens and in
a few moments a number of armed men
were on the streets. A hurried inspection
aisclosed the fact that the robbers had
made a clean job of their work, but had
taken nothing- from the safe but money.
Many valuable paper? were left intact.

The plaintiffs ask that they be adjudged

Campbell left an estate worth about $S,
(00,000. In his will Campbell devised one
third of hjs personal property to his wife,
in 'lieu of her dower In his estate, and all !
the'rest of the estate. he devised to . his !
wife and to Joseph D. Carter and Cecil
Brown as trustees, to hold as a trust to
provide a safe Income for the wife and
for the children and grandchildren. Their
authority was to continue during the, nat
ural lives of the wife and of the children
or grandchildren who might be living at
the time of his death. The will was pro
bated in 1!XX). the widow was appointed
administratrix on December 30, 1901. and
under an order of court the St. James j
Hotel property was sold. ;
It is pet forth in the ccmplaint that the i
trust provision is null and void under the j
laws of California, in that it extends be
yond the lives of the beneflrfarie;!. Â¦ In
order to defeat a contest In this State It ]
Is charged 'that prior to August Â», 1902, J
the defendants conspired to deprive the j
plaintiffs of their inheritance in the hotel (
property and to have it appear that the !
legal title to the hoteH should be trans- !
f erred to the widow and from her to the \
other defendants as trustees, and to have
the property converted into money, to be '
nominally distributed as such, in order :
that the money might appear to be taken j
to Hawaii, outside the jurisdiction of the !
Superior Court in this county. v ;
"In pursuance of such conspiracy," j
plaintiffs say. "the 'widow procured an ;
order of sale from the court and procured j
from her 'daughter. Alice K. Campbell, ;
residing at Honolulu, a nominal bid for j
the hotel of $163,250, although she' had no i
means with which to make the purchase. Â¦Â¦
The sale was confirmed, and the widow j
procured a nominal decree of distribution j
to the exclusion of the rights of plaint- j
iffs." It is claimed that Mrs. Campbell i
advanced the money .to her daughter to j
make the purchase. i
Besides the sale of the St. James Hotel i
for $1C6,25O, it is alleged that some $20,000 j
for rent of hotel, etc., came into the J
hands of Mrs. Campbell-Parker, making]
a total of $152,572. It is alleged that this |
money has not been turned over to the |
trustees, also a receipt for the same has j
been given to Mrs. Parker. The complaint j
states that Alice K. Campbell has since j
conveyed the St. James property to the
other defendants, "with the view of de
priving the plain tiffs of their rights
therein." They say they were ignorant
of these facts until it was too late to
obtain adequate relief in this court from
the sale and decree on the ground of
fraud.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 26.â A sensational suit
charging fraud and conspiracy in the
sale and transfer of the St James Ho
tel In the estate of the late James Camp
bell, the Hawaiian millionaire, was filed
to-day by Attorney H. L. Gear of San
Francisco. A short time age Gear was
appointed attorney ad litcm for Mary and
Muriel 'Ctmpbell. minor children of the
deceased, and at that time a contest of
the decree of distribution of property in
this city was started. To-day the appoint
ment of Gear in that matter was up on a
motion of C. T. Bird, attorney for Mrs.
Abigail Parker-Campbell, the mother of
the children, for a dismissal on the
ground that the time of appeal had ex
pired. This afternoon Judge Hyland
granted the dismissal.

! bruised and scarred by the fingers of the

j and motionless mother gazed and. looked
her last upon eachi.from the little seven
| months-olti bnbe to the oldest girl, whose
lacerated" throat bore evidence other fu
. tile struggle for life. Â¦ g . j
All day long a stream of sorrowing and
sympathizing friends and relatives havo
gazed upon the lifeless bodies of the chil
dren and nothing but deepest sympathy
for the husband and father and pity for
!' the hapless mother 1 Is heard on all sides.
Mrs. Iverson, who is about 32 years of
age, was a member of the Danish Lutheran
church and was very religious. Since the
j birth of her last child she has been fall
ine in health.
The funeral of the three children will be
held to-morrow afternoon. Services will
be held at the Danish Lutheran' church,
after which the bodies will be interred in
the Odd Fellows' Cemetery.
Calmly and coldly the woman related all
the details of the successive struggles
with' the little victims of her mania.
When asked her reason for her acts Bhe
stated that it was the work of a superior
will and- that she was powerless to resist.
She stated that for a long time she had
felt that she was drifting away from re
ligion and that some sacrifice was needed
to bring her batik.
During her examination Mrs. Iverson
would break off in her recital and ask
that her children be brought to her and
she repeatedly inquired if some one had
gone to thjC sanitarium for them. Â¦ After
listening to the recital the attending phy
sicians pronounced her insane and Judge
Sargent committed her to the Slate hospi
tal at Agnews, to which place she was
taken on the noon train to-day by Sheriff
W. Â«J. Nesbitt. On the road to the depot
she asked to be taken to see her children
and the sad party stopped at tho under
taker's where, supported by her grief
stricken husband, bowed almost to the
verge of madness with the horror and
griff of his bereavement, the dry-eyed un
fotunate beheld the victims.
Mrs.- Iverson refused to believe that the
childre-n were dead, but' claimed that they
were in a trance and would j in time
awaken. She demanded that some one go
to the Salines Bantarlum and get them
and bring them to her so that she might
awaken them. ; â¢ â¢ Â¦
The ; demented woman related to the
physicians the details of the horror and
described how she had takrn the children
one at a time, beginning with the oldest,
Louise, aged 12 years,/ and had choked
them until death stopped thoir struggles.
She described how the oldest girl' hnd re
sisted and scratched her face in efforts to
break away from the death grip upon her
throat. â¢â¢
This morning one of the final scenes was
enacted and those who were present at
the examination of the unfortunate
mother will never forget the impression
made. The examination was held at the
Iverson â¢ residency by Judge B. V. Sar
gent and Drs. John Parker and Elizabeth

There wa3 a dramatic quarrel between
Roberts and Seddon in the witnesses'
waiting room to the Grand Jury. Roberta
bad heard that Seddon had denied the au
thenticity of an interview with him to
which he (Seddon) had admitted that
when Robert3 had first told blni of Blair's
wrongdoings, he had at first discredited
them, but subsequently verified their
truth. Seddon's only reply to Roberts
was: "I have nothing to say."
Judge Seddon, Blair's former partner
and who succeeds him as general counsel
of the World's Fair, was before the Grand
Jury. News of his revelations can be only
conjectured. James Campbell, a broker,
was another witness. He is supposed to
have been Questioned as to the truth or
falsity of the story that he came to
Blair's assistance in settling up an alleged
shortage in the Blow estate, of which
Blair was trustee.

It Is further asserted that Receiver
Smith will ask the court to give its sanc
tion to the bringing cf suits by him
against Charies M. Schwab for the recov
ery from the latter cf stocks and bonds
cf the shipbuilding company to the
amount of more than CO.CCCCOQ, on the
ground that he did not get them In a
manner within his rights and in keeprng
with the rights of the other stockholders.
NEW YORK. Oct. 26.â The report cf
former Senator James Smith Jr. as re
ceiver for the United States Shipbuilding
Company will be filed with Judge Klrk
patrick of the Xewark Federal Court be
fore Wednesday. It contains about *Â».00O
words, according to men familiar with
the details, although Senator Smith to
day refused to speak about its contents
or magnitude. Several weeks were em
ployed In Its preparation. Senator Smith
has received the completed typewritten
copy cf his report and has turned it over
to K. V. Lindabury of the law firm of
Lindabury. Dupue & Falks of Newark.
Men familiar with every phase of the
affairs of the shipbuilding company for
the last six or eight months say that Re
ceiver Smith's report can tell only of the
muddled, disorganized and money-losing
state in which he has found all. or nearly
ail. of the subsidiary companies, and that
he will Insist upon compelling the releas
ing of the immense profits of the Bethle
hem works for the purpose of rehabilitat
ing the other concerns and putting them
all on their feet again.
The facts produced In court thus far
and additional information said to be
within the knowledge of Senator Smith,
in his capacity of receiver, it Is said.
show that the money earned by the Beth- 1
lehem plant has been celd up. and that
but for the action of C. M. Schwab and
others concerned in that operation the
collapse of the monster parent company
would not have occurred.
It is also declared to be almost a cer
tainty that Smith will demand that a re
ceiver be appointed for the Bethltnem
plant In ordÂ«r to get the money which Is
being held a:? there. He cannot charge
that it is an Insolvent concern, but he
may aek to have It placed In the hands of
a receiver on the ground that the conduct
cf Its affairs has been of a fraudulent
nature and in violation of the rights of
the stockholders of the shipbuilding com
pany, which Is entitled to the profits.

President William Scallon of the Ana

proposition made by Hcinze for a <Ieed
to five- thirty-sixths of the Nipper stock
In controversy between the Anaconda
Company and Heinze and the Parrott
Company In return for the sale of the
block of ICO shares In the Boston and
Montana and 130 shares In the Parrott
Company owned by John MacGinniss. "
. President Scallon characterized 'the
proposition of Heinze as astounding and
ridiculous and unworthy of. consideration.
In a statement issued to the press to
night Scallon says these offers may look
Innocent enough on the face, but tn real
ity they amount to a refusal to settle the
MacGinniss cases. They are a. turning
down cf the Miners* Union proposition.
because the conditions cf Helnze's offers
are so unreasonable and exorbitant that
they are Impossible of acceptance. .'
"As to the proposed arbitration." Scal
lon says. **it is one not recoenized by
law; it would not be and could not be
made binding en Heinze and, unfortu
nately, would settle nothing, but cc-nld
only lead to more prolonged \ litigation.
The Amalgamated people are not indis
posed to settle these controversies, and
any effective method of doing so would
receive consideration; and I would sug
gest that the best way to settle any diffi
culty Is for both parties to try to be fair.
If Heinze would try to be ftir doubtless
a reasonable settlement would . be
reached."

After his address Heinze had thousands
of printed circulars distributed upon the
streets of the city. The circular, which is
Identical in substance with the oral prop

made by Heinze to a mass meeting: of

High Class Druggists
AND â OTHERS.
The better class 0! druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devote their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known value, in accordance with physicians' prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better' class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts "of a first-clas3 pharmacy and^ the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long yeara of study and many hours of daily toH. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of cold3 and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there i3 no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction. ;
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there^ ara
individual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have the name â " Syrup of Figs" â or <r Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name ol
the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should -be rejected because they are injurious to the system.^ In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer pas3C3
o2 on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs'* or **Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the fall name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate a3 to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling ol
physicians 1 prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom i: may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company-
California Fig Syrup Co*â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the,
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class ot
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the'best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

/nr^Â° the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir:
1 The article published in the Sunday Bulletin with reference to the conversation of Mr. Ed Casey
JL and myself is absolutely incorrect. j
Not one word was spoken between us relative to the Mayoralty fight; I never said one word about
Mr. Herrin or Henry J. Crocker. . _ , ;
The only conversation that took place between us was relative to the fight for County Clerk. In this
fight Mr. Casey is greatly interested. Mr. Casey asked me my opinion and what to do.
Mr. Casey told me that Ruef was interested in the fight of Powel Fredrick, and also asked me my
advice -what to do about this fight. 'I told him that I would see what I could do. I , also told him that I
was greatly interested in the fight of Johnny Greif and in the fight of Henry ! JÂ« Crocker, and that I was
for the Republican ticket. .^
Our conversation had absolutely nothing to do with the Mayor, or with Mr. Herrin. The only
reference that I made to the Mayor was that I said I was interested in the fight of Crocker for Mayor.
I am a Republican, and I intend . to vote . for Crocker Â¦ and : for the Republican ticket.
,1 have had no conversation with Mr. Herrin for months in reference to politics, and I may say that
I am a friend of his, and that he has never asked me to do a single piece of work for him or to vote for
any candidate.- 1.
My conversation with Ed. Casey related absolutely to Johnny Greif for County . Clerk, ; and no refer
ence was made to the Mayor, or any other candidate. .:. Â¦'Â¦'."
I am for Henry J. Crocker and the Republican ticket. L. H. BROWN.

UNEQUIVOCAL DENIAL IS GIVEN
TO A SILLY CAMPAIGN FALSEHOOD
CROWDS GBEET SCHMITZ.
Mayor Delivers Speeches Before Two
Big Mass Meetings. Â¦
Mayor Schmltz spoke before two large
gatherings last night, one at Harmony
Hall, 1749 Mission street, and the other at
Manzanita Hall, on Perry street near
Fourth, In both instances the halls were
crowded so that available standing room
was at a premium.
As the candidate for Mayor walked into
the halls cheer upon cheer greeted him,
and during his speeches he was interrupt
ed time and again by cheers and cries of
"God bless you. Schmitz." ,
At Harmony Hall John W. Rogers, pres
ident of the Civil Â¦ Service Commission,
presided and delivered the opening ad
dress. In part he said:
The opposition realizes that its fight is lost,
and in this the last week of the campaign, a
desperate effort will be made by Insinuation
and vicious falsehoods to prevent the election
of Schmltz by undermining the -loyalty and
confidence of the people. But the people are
satisfied with conditions as they are. These
political scarecrow stories do" not frighten
them. They recall that two years ago terri
ble, blood-curdling" predictions were made as
to the awful calamity that would overtake oui"
beautiful city In case Schmltz were elected
Mayor. A noted and brilliant Democratic at
torney, in a large public meeting, while the
audience eat breathless and spellbound, tlrew
a terrible word picture. He pictured the
streets of San Francisco overrun . with wild
mobs, pillaging and murdering as they went,
and while the city was burning and in ruins
Mayor Schmltz. like Nero of Rome. Indiffer
ent and unconcerned would be found playing
his fiddle at the City Hall. As an orator this
distinguished gentleman was a, great success,
but as a prophet he was a rank failure.
We were also told . that if Schnjttx were
elected Mayor, a period of business depression
and hard times would ensue, the building in
dustry would be at a standstill, and Eastern
capitalists would be afraid to Invest -their
money here. What are the facts? It is
truÂ« there have been labor difficulties, but they
have been settled peacefully and with honor
and satisfaction to both sides. Â¦ -
Mayor Schmltz has endeavored to treat both
sides with equal justice and fairness. He has
Impressed upon labor that, capital has rights
which they must respect, that their Interests
are mutual and Interdependent, and that the
welfare and prosperity of the country depends
upon the maintenance and continuance of
friendly relations between capital and labor.
Are you satisfied with conditions as they
are? If you are. then stand and vote to
gether, and our next Mayor will be Eugene
E. Schmlti. . , .
Mayor Schmltz then responded and held

At first it was believed that Hugh
McLaughlin. the veteran leader of the
Kings County Democrats, had approved
the action of the committee of fifteen,
but the following day he made a long
statement in which he declared his con
tinued opposition to Tammany Hall.
After th*? meeting of the committee of
fifteen McCarren took charge of the
Democratic campaign in Kings County.
The places of Grout and Fornes on the
fusion ticket were taken by Helnricks
and McGuire. respectively.
In the West the liveliest contest is
in Ohio, where Myron T. Herrick and
Tom L. Johnson, both of Cleveland, are
the leaders on the Republican and Demo
cratic tickets, and Marcus A. Hanna and
John H. Clark are struggling for mem
bers cf the Legislature which will elect
a United States Senator.
In Iowa Albert B. Cummins is making
his second race for Governor, his oppo
nent being Jeremiah B. Sullivan, who is
depending on the Democratic vote, the
Populists having their own State ticket
in the field.
Governor Beckham Is seeking re-elec
tion in Kentucky, the Republican candi
date being Morris B. Belknap, who is
making a very active canvass.
The Democrats will have a walk
over in Mississippi, neither the Republi
cans nor any other opposition party
having put a ticket in the field.
The contest In Nebraska is for a Jus
lict of the Supreme Court. The Repub
lican candidate is John D. Barnes, the
I^cmccrats and Populists fusing on John
D. Sullivan. Two Regents of the State
University are to be chosen.
In Colorado the Democrats made a
straight nomination for Judge of the
Supreme Court, the Populists putting up
â¢jne of their own party.
The following are the tickets nomi
.^r-ted by the different parties in the
eleven States:
Owing to the split between Tammany
jr.d Hugh McLaughlin the Brooklyn or
ganization, though it indorsed McClellan,
at first refused to include Grout for
Comptroller and Forms for President pf
the Board of Aldermen in its resolutions
ratifying the ticket, because they had
.been th<Â» fusion nominees, having been
Cropped by the fusionists when the Dem
ocrats indorsed them. Hugh McLaughlin
<!o< la red that these men were not Dem
ocrats Â«nd that he would not support
th*m. The fight in their behalf was
made, however by State Senator Pat
rick H. McCarren, and at his request a
meeting of the Kings County Committee
mi called to consider a resolution pro
posed by McCarren declaring for the en
tire Democratic ticket, including Grout
and Kornes. This resolution was lost by
a vote of 141 to 1*8. but the subject was
referred to a committee of fifteen, and
this committee, after several days' con
sideration, met and adopted a resolution
pledging support to Grout and Fornes.
Mclaughlin not placated.

Pennsylvania will elect an Auditor Gen-
Ttil Treasurer and two Judges of the
Superior Court.
Court of Appeals Judge is the only State
office to be voted for in New York. Judge
Dermis O'Brien, Democrat, will have the
:ace to himself, having been indorsed by
the Republicans. The interest in New
; York will center in the municipal and
county contests in Manhattan and Kings
boroughs. Seth Low. the present Mayor,
*s the fusion candidate, and' George B.
McC'.ellan the Democratic nominee. Ex-
Deputy Police Commissioner Devery is
nr. independent candidate, and the Prohi

party in threeâ New York. Massachusetts

one State. Nebraska, though the Repub
licans* of New York indorsed the Demo

The most interesting contests in the
East arc the State elections in Maryland
and Rhode Island and the municipal and
county contests in New York City.
In Maryland the offices of Governor,
Comptroller and Attorney General will be

Abe Ruef could not get the Republican party
behind him in his political schemes, so he
has got something else.
My friends, this appeal which I am making
to you to-night is not. an appeal to elect me
to the honored office of this municipality for
any personal gratification nor for any glory.
I simply aeek to be elected that I may devoto
myself to the welfare of this city.
I am perfectly willing to put aside- and sac
rifice, any personal desires, even the practice
of my profession, that this community may
have the benefit of my services in the care
and consideration of its government.
No Mayor of this city can devote but six
hours a' day to the fulfillments of his duties.
He must devote twelve hours a day.
I beg you all to break away from partisan

us have a government mat is honest, fair,
square and true. -Let us have & government
whose chief officials are not hound* tied and

Fpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 26. -Election
betting was exciting to-day on
the Broad-street curb. About
$25,000 was wagered at Taryttt*
odds, mainly In favor of liay-
or Low. At one time even
money was placed in considerable quan
tities on the Tammany candidate, but
the preponderance of fusion funds again
forced the difference.
The various preliminary forecasts did
much to unsettle betting and this made
Tammany supporters more confident.
The result was that the opening wagers
were at odds of 10 to 9 on Low, where on
Saturday 10 to 8 was offered without tak
ers. Considerable money was placed at
10 to 9.
Tammany's confidence that it will have
a chance once more to give to the city a
"good, honest government" Increases Just
In proportion as Tammany's election day
fund grows, and the election day fund ts
large enough to burst the hoops of a bar
rel. What the fusion orators describe as
"the contractors' trust" has scored with
a vengeance. Even the contractors on
the subway have been influenced to con
tribute to the fund which Tammany ex
pects to count for much on election day.
What is Tammany going to do with the
money? Why should a contractor under
a fusion government give checks to Tam
many? These are some of the questions
the fusion orators are preparing to ask
in the last hours of the battle.
The campaign went on to-day with
great vigor. Mayor Low made a tour in
an automobile and spoke a half-dozen
times. McClellan made many speeches,
in all of which he denounced fusion as a
sham. District Attorney Jerome spoke
several times and was listened to with
enthusiasm.
Masterson's Illness Delays Case.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 27.â Henry Chris

connection with E. F. Masterson. with
swindling the Continental Building and
Loan Association of San Francisco out of
$1427 on an application for a loan pur

court this morning. When the case was

asked that the setting of it be postponed
until the arrival of E. F. Masterson from

would be one of their most important wit

the hay market Mr. Crocker visited thÂ«
box factory of Carrick & Williams and
Masterson & Hickman's lumber yards,
where he was warmly received by from
250 to 300 men. Later he visited the Union
Feed Company's works on Berry street,
and a good many men from the Stude
baker'works came over there to meet Mr.
Crocker. Then he looked around through
the Pacific Coast Glass Works. A large
number of men there and elsewhere came
up and declared themselves for Crocker.
They wished him success, and to quota
the words of a workman, "made him feÂ«l
that they were behind him in the fight."
Things are evidently propitious for the
Republican nominee among the men of
the docks and workshops. Among other
places visited by Mr. Crocker yesterday
were the works of the Lonr Syrap Com
pany, Stuparich Manufacturing Company.
Dow Pump Company, James A. Railing &

CROCKER AND LYNCH.
JeromÂ© Bassity's Bears Axs ox* the
Winning Side.
Have you seen the "Jerome and Bas
sity Bears?" Of course you have; two
little cubs, one a Crocker bear and tho
other a Lynch bear. If you haven't Just
rubber up and down Market street any
day from now until election and you'll see
the animals bearing the banners of two
of the Republican ticket that are golnj
to be elected In November.
Jerome Bassity tells an interesting story
oi how the bears proffered their services
in behalf of the good old party.
One day last week when Jerome's house
was In its busiest .hour a small boy camÂ©
trooping In with two bears on the end of
a string, both walking upon their hind
legs. The crowd, about to spend some
money in the house, all turned to see the
new arrivals, and during a momentary
vision of lost patronage Bassity ordered
the kid out. Instead of going the boy
presented him with the following letter:
Friend Basatty â Accept the accompanying
â¢â¢packages" with my compliments. They are
very tame- have been raised on a bottle sine*
they were* three days old. They have eaten
no meat; so far only old fruit, bread and such
Uhlnss Put them to work. Tours truly,
tnmgs. nÂ» w HODGES.
For a few hours Bassity had a couple of
beara on his hands, and they may as well
have been elephants as bears, for they
were as much in the way. The happy
thought then struck their new owner and
he decided to enlist their services in the
interests of the Republican party. The
bears were willing and that's why you'll
see them every day doing duty getting
votes for the "Grand Old Party."

Franklin K. Lane addressed an audience
of voters of the Thirty-seventh Assembly
District last night that packed Devlsaclero

the theme of his discourse non-partisan
ship, and said in part:

James A. Devoto made a stirring ad
dress and was greeted with a great deal
of applause. Many other labor candidates
addressed the meeting.
The second meeting, at Manzanita Hall,
was as largely attended as the first and
the ovation given the Mayor and other
speakers none the less stirring.
A man never knows what a blackguard he
has been the most of his life until he enters
politics. I have been surprised to learn what a
bad man I have been and what a bad adminis
tration I have given the city. One of the
city's dally papers in an editorial about eight
months ago said what a queer Mayor I hau
made. I had carried out everything that l
had promised at the time of my election, i
have no newspaper to back me in this right,
possibly because they cannot control me. l
want to say right here that no newspaper or
any body of men can control me when I be
lieve I am right, I am sorry for the papers
of San Francisco, not for what they have done
against me, but what they have done against
themselves. It shows that In their prior com
mendation of me they were either lying or that
in blackmailing me now they are lying.
I beseech you to pay no attention to the
newspapers or the lying circulars that are be
ing passed around, as one would stab a man
in the back and give him no chance to defend
himself. It was in order to see fair play that
the United States went to war with Spain, to
protect a weaker people that were being op->
pressed. It is for the same reason that I want
to be elected," bo thai the plain people will not
be oppressed by capital, or that- the capital
shall not be oppressed by labor. I shall give
fair play to all and special favors to none.
I have nothing to stand upon but my past
record. I" have been Mayor for all of the peo
ple, making no distinction for color, race or

Drop all partisanship and vote for the men
whose names are known and who you know
wtll serve you and yours to the utmost extent

men who will see that the future of this great
municipality is fully protected, and In doing
this you will be true to yourselves, true to
your country, true to your city and true to your

I now appeal to you. my Republican fellow

to you to ask you to vote for the Supervisors
that the bosses have placed upon your Republi

CANDIDATES FOR THE MAYORALTY OF GREATER NEW YORK AND
HEADS OF RIVAL. TICKETS IN THREE STATES WHERE VIGOR
OUS CAMPAIGNS ARE NOW DRAWING TO A CLOSE.
ON Tuesday, November 3, elections for State officers will be
held in eleven and municipal officers will be chosen
in Greater New York, San' Francisco and Salt Lake.
Greater interest, perhaps, centers in the contest in the former city
than in other that is to be decided next Tuesday.- Although
the issue is localâ Tammany vs. fusion reform forces- â the result
may Have an important bearing , upon the national election in
1904. .Of- the State elections those in Ohio, Maryland and Ken
tucky will be watched with keen anxiety by leaders of both par
ties. The campaigns in these three commonwealths have been
fought bitterly, on national issues, and in the latter two States the
result is in doubt. Senator Hanna is striving in Ohio to "capture
the Legislature, which is to name his successor, his Democratic op
ponent bqing John H. Clark.- Reports of the progress- of the cam
paign in Ohio leave no doubt of a Republican triumph.

Unicn League Club. Every seat was oc
cupied as early as 8 o'clock, and fcefore
thÂ« meeting had teen In. progress fifteen
mintites every aisle was crowded and
erery Inch _,of avaSaale apace was
pressed Into service to accommodate the
tremendous gathering.
The fair sex was present ia large num
ber and the ladies enjoyed thÂ« speaking
as much as their male escorts- -The plat
form was crowded with members of the
Unicn Leagre and Dlriro clubs. The lat
ter marched " Into the hall during thÂ«
progress of the meeting and their slogan
echoed through the strcctTire- One hun
dred and nfty voices were nis*^ in the
dub cry. which ran something like this:
Wxa whoo wai!
Walt whoo was:
DtrtgoT DMrÂ»*-
Wah. whoo wah.!
C-r-o-c-k.-e-r!
The Union Leagne QtÂ»rtet sang cam
paign Â«o=ga and Bennett's band rendered
patriotic melodies throughout the even
ing- Shortly before Crocker was? Intro
duced to the big audience seven members
of the Bohemian Club appeared and sang
two songs that created a great &eal of
enthusiasm. Their sirging j was la per
fect harmony and the audience, could not
get enough of It. j Chairman* Stone quiet
ed the audience fcr a few seconds while
Introducing the standard bearer of the
party and taea the pent-up enthusiasm of
thÂ« gathering trcke loose again and the
plaudits could be heard a block away.
The very rafters rang with cheers. Every
mas in the audience yelled and waved his
hat. The fair sex added their shouts and
waved their handkerchiefs at the popular
candidate. The scene was a spectacular
cne. Mr. Crocker's reception and the ap- ,
plause accorded the various rpeakera left
no doubts ia the minds of the auditors
that the Republican ticket would be suc
cessful at the coming municipal election.
Carey Van Fleet made his bow as aa
eratcr and proved himself a wit of high
crder. Els sarcastic criticisms on the
candidates struck home and were heartily
enjoyed. Duncan McKinlay was the ora
tor of the evening and his impassioned ut
terances were received with tremendous
applause. The members started to de
part wfcen Mr. Crocker concluded " his
excellent tpeech, but returned to their
seats whea Judge George H. Bahrs was
Introduced. The fame of this whirlwind
campaigner bad spread and all seemed â¢
eager to hear him. He did Dot disappoint '
them. His speech was delivered | with
great vigor. All hfs assertions were loud
ly cheered and when he denounced the
story which appeared in" aa evening paper
that Schmitz asd himself had entered
into a. compact the assemblage became
wildly enthusiastic Judge Bahrs gained
many votes and his confidence la his own
ability to defeat the 'Invincible" candi
date who seeks a third term filled the
bieasts of sis' friends with the same feel-
Ing and they left the hall positive that be
win be elected " and determined to bring
about that result.'

withstanding all the ranting and tumult
cf the Democratic meminr Â«" rt evenins
râ¬*Â£;Â£r*?rs it is an even betting- prcpo
siticn that L*n* will not carry any ether

A clcs* nsit in thÂ« Fcrty-fcurth Dis

shJtowe-1. The district is larp?, ccntain

publican ticket is concerned. If wÂ»ak
sjsd wavering Republican business men
can be faded into the n<?tica cf votinsr for

the result will bÂ« the triumph cf Schmitx.
So far as any chance cf party success
is concerned the Democrats are net in the

surely a vote for Sehmitx.

The football season is in , full r blast. \ From hundreds of
college fields come the cries of victor and janquished and
the giants of the gridiron are the heroes of the day. In.a
galaxy so brilliant it -is: difficult, -if not invidious, to choose
the most distinguished; but, everything considered, Annapo
lis seems easily to have the best of it. In a recent game
one of the players was crushed and mangled and died on
the field with his honors about him.

Rough on the Ladies.
Maybe if women were not so busy with
their mouths in another way they would
really learn to smoke.
When a woman aaya a man treats her
brutally she means she can't make him
give in in an argument even.by crying.
When a woman brags about a thought
ful, child she has she means he forgot to
pull its talfcout of the cat that morning.
The man who got up the theory that
you can save money by being married
must have been the same idiot who start
ed the fiyinz machine Idea.
Nothing makes a man feel so queer
when the minister calls as to hear his
wife tell him all the signs their father

WITH the recent organization in New York City of
a Postal Progress League, enthusiastically indorsed
by many of the leading merchants and publishers,
a notable step has been taken toward attaining the desired
parcels service... A campaign will be vigorously prosecuted
both in Congressional halls and out in the interest of the
establishment of a* domestic parcels post department of the
United States Postoffice similar to those now in operation in
over thirty countries of the universal postal union. Opposed
to the movement will be the united strength of the express
companies, who see in the proposed addition to the work of
the postal service a measure prejudicial- to their interests/
Judging by the success of the parcels post system abroad,
the United States Government, with its lack of a parcels
post, is distinctly behind the times. ; In 1880 Germany estab
lished a domestic system and then called a congress of repre
sentatives of the leading powers to form an international
parcels post union. The union was formed, and from time to
time new members have been admitted until at present there
ire thirty-five nations in. the league. Within its own boun
daries Germany fixed a charge of 6 cents for any parcel
under twelve pounds for: transportation of not more, than
forty-six miles: for 12 cents, a like weight can be delivered
to. the farthest limits of Austria. ." Switzerland went still fur
ther, carrying eleven pounds to any place in the republic
for 8 cents and providing an indemnity of not over $3 for
delays in delivery. \
So long as the United States Government contents. itself
with parcel post treaties with Germany, a few English de
pendencies and republics in Latin America, to the exclu
sion of the system from its own territories, just so long does
it remain a laggard in postoffice efficiency. By combination
among themselves the private .express companies who now
handle parcels are enabled to demand air the traffic will bear
without let or hindrance. The efficiency of their service de
pends entirely upon t^jeir^respectrVe. managements. In
sparsely settled communities their service has little or no re
liability. -,...'- ; -
The Government alone can insure a safe and i fair parcel
delivery. It is for Congress to decide upon the last step
which will place the United States. Postoffice upon a par with
those of the powers of Europe.

A Reporter's Late
Detail Proves Itself
a Dead One
T T 7 HILE Mr. Randolph Hearst is making a tour of
\/\/ the South and giving his own opinion of his own
V Â¦â¢ merits in his own newspapers Mr. Arthur Pue
Gorman is working like a blacksmith to hammer out a
Democratic issue for next year upon which he will ask for
the Presidential nomination.
It- must be confessed that Mr. Hearst's campaign re
sembles that of John Alexander Dowie. He may be called
the Dowie of American politics, since he continually puts
his preposterous personality forward and languishes in his
own arms, intoxicated with his own charms and absorbed
in petting himself. But Mr. Gorman is not that kind of a
politician, for he is not compelled to buy newspapers that
he may see his name in print. He knows a lot about poli
tics, and one thing, well learned in his interesting career, is
the value of prejudices as an influence upon the American
voter. â¢
... Senator Bob Toombs said to a young friend who was
ambitious to enter politics,. ''Remember,. Jimmy, that in
getting votes one prejudice is worth a thousand reasons."
Mr. Gorman needs no instruction on that point, and, after
looking at all the shelf-worn goods in the Democratic store
of issues, concludes that there is another campaign in the
"color line." He will take high ground for a white man's
government, and appeal not only to the South but to .the
Northern States where there are negro voters. He thinks
that the campaign should be a personal one, aimed at Presi
dent Roosevelt.
If the Democratic party have friends, they should pray
for its delivery from Mr. Gorman. The issue he proposes
is not one of reason and principle, but of prejudice and ex
pediency. It of necessity brings Senator Tillman forward
as the chosen party leader, for he has made the issue in ad
vance of Mr. Gorman. He has declared that if necessary
every negro in the South must be shot, "just to teach them
their place." What steps will Mr. Gorman The
negro is now efficiently disfranchised in the South, and the
Supreme Court has held that the question is political and
not judicial. That being true, there seems to be no way
in which the disfranchising clauses in the constitutions of
the Southern States can be reached by any external author
ity. So what does Mr. Gorman, propose, except a campaign
of abuse and prejudice against a defenseless race that is
already deprived of political power?
Does he want to follow disfranchisement with massacre?
Or does he want to deport the race and get rid of it finally
and forever? " He may rest assured that the country will
not listen to a campaign of personal abuse and misrepre
sentation of the President, nor will it be diverted from the
great problems of government by Tillmanesque tirades
against "niggers." If the Democracy have a pojicy in re
gard to the negro question, let it be stated, that it may be
judged on its merits, as a policy, to be, passed on by the
people. If Mr. Gorman can phrase such a policy to go into
the platform let him do so. The country is in no temper to
indorse the Tillman issue, nor to back a party that appeals
to prejudice and tl\c spirit of lawlessness and disorder.
If nothing better than murder can be offered as a_solu
tion of the race question, and murder is what . an ; appeal 'to
prejudice will mean, Mr. Gorman ; would better strike' work
on his new issue'and quit his job right where it is.

**>OXING is more than an accom-
A^[ plishment. It is a necessity. The
* ~ boy who has not learned to box
has not yet made his own acquaintance.
In other words, he is igT.orant <>f his own
muscles, hjs own powers or limitations,
and even of his own temperament. For
boxing teaches all these things. It
strengthens and lends deftness, speed and
endurance to the body; it teaches the
brain to think and to think quickly. It
teaches courage and coolness, and, above
all, it teaches the art of controlling one's
temper.
It you. as a boy, do not care to acquire
eil these advantages and many more
which follow in the train t)f boxing, then
I advise you not to study these lessons.
They will not interest you. But if you are
earnestly desirious of learning to box I
will gladly teach you. If you conscien
tiously foilow all the instructions I shall
give in these articles I can promise you
that you will be a clever boxer and that
you will, moreover, find yourself in far
better condition both physically and men
tally. Should you have any questions to
ask I shall be pleased to receive them ar.d
will answer promptly by mail. I shall be
very glad indeed to clear up any doubtful
points or give additional advice to all pu
pilÂ« who will take the trouble to send me
ruch queries. I shall also be most inter
ested in hearing of any Improvement.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Before I begin on our first lesson I have
a word or two to speak to the parents of
my pupils.
I can almost hear %ore than one gentle
mother protest:
"I can't bear to have my boy learn to
fight. It's so vulgar and brutalizing."
My dear madam, 1 am not teaching
your boy to fight, but to box. There is as
much difference between scientific spar
ring and rough-and-tumb'e fighting as
there is between the music of a piano and
the music of back-fence cats. Moreover,
I have no Intention of allowing your boy
to become^ brutalized through these les
sons of mine. He will learn control of
body and temper, will learn to take defeat
and victory alike philosophically and will
learn to avoid rather than seek quarrels.
Is thtre anything vulgar or brutalizing
about that?
Or I can hear pome father scoff at the
idea and complain that If the boy learns
how to usre his hands he'll be in a fight
every day at school, with an attendant
bill for replacing torn clothes, as a cli
max to thÂ» orgy. As I have said, the lad
who thoroughly understands boxing has
usually enough Eclf-confldence and self
control to keep him out of unnecessary
rows, and the boy who is known to pos
sess-such science is sejdom forced into
a fight.
Or come man whose memory dates
back to the middle of the last century
vill recall with disgust the "boxing
matches" of that day, wherein men play
fully bit off each other's ears, b'roke bones*
r<nd in other ways demonstrated their
.!t!e to membership in the brute creation.
That boxing in those times was brutal no
one can deny. That it is brutal to-day is
;alse. Even prize lighting. (a far cry, by
the way, from friendly boxing) Is in
finitely less brutal Â¦ under modern rules
than is an ordinary football game. Three
men are killed or permanently injured on
the football gridiron where one receives
:\ Jike fate in the prize ring.
Let your beys take my lessons. You
owe ft to them to allow them to develop
their bodies to the highest decree. In
no other way can this be done as readily
and as surely.
And now let me go back to my boy pu
pils.
No boy who is not a bully will seek a
fight. But no boy who is not a coward
will elink s^way .from a fight when he
cannot hoijorkljly avoid the conflict.
President Roosevelt, who fought his
way to the top of life's ladder, has crys
tallized this idefl in a speech he made
Fome time ajro before a mother's conven
tion. He Â«ald: *â¢
"If any of you mothers have a boy who
Â¦will not fight on good provocation, that
boy is not worth his salt. He is a cow
ard. Train your boy to use his fighting
instincts on the side of righteousness.
But punish anything like cruelty. Punish
him when he abuses his strength."
That is better advice on the subject of
self-defense than L: could have written In
ten pages. *
And now let us stop lecturing and get
down to work. In the first place, you
cannot be a good boxer unless you also
go through a few other simple exercises,
observe a few health rules and map out
your day Into a regular routine.
In the first place, you must leave to
bacco alone. . Second, you must drink no
alcoholic liquors. This is not mere advice.
It is a hard-and-fast rule. If you break
it you can never hope, to be an athlete.
Tobacco will ruin your wind and shake
yi>ur nerves. . Liquor has no equal as a
wrecker of constitutions. This isn't mor
alizing, but a fact that universal expe
rience has borne out.
Eat heartily of plain, wholesome fare.
Avoid fried or fatty foods, eat sparingly
of sweets. Sleep at least nine hours (ten
hours would be better) out of the twenty
four. Go to bed by' 9 p. m. if possible.
See that your bedroom is well ventilated.
Take no violent exercise for half an
hour after eating. Avoid anything that
can weaken or injure you. So much for
health rules. (But bear them in mind, for
each is important.) \
Now for exercises: When you get up in
the morning, go through the following
simple calisthenics: Lie flat on your
back, rise slowly until almost at a sitting
posture, then let yourself sink slowly
back to the ground again, repeating tins
maneuver ten times. Then, standing up
right, rise on the toes twenty times.
Next, bend forward as far as possible
(keeping the heels together all the time)
without losing your balance. Do this ten
times. Then lean backward as far as pos
sible the same number of times, and
then for each side ten times.
You may, if you wish, also go through
a five-rr.lnute maneuvering with very
light dumb-bells or Indian clubs. All this
time take long slow breaths with the
mouth closed. Then, at the conclusion of
these exercises, take a cool (not ice cold)
bath, remaining in the water only two
minutes at the longest and "rubbing
down" with a rough towel. Dress qu'ckly
to avoid taking cold. Go through same
calisthenics just before going to bed at
night. Later I will give you fuller direc
tions for exercise, diet, etc., but the fore
going will do for the present, as I sup
pose you are anxious to get the gloves
on. *"-â¢
Find some other boy of about your own
age and size and make him your "spar
ring partner." In this way you will both'
learn more quickly. Box together, giving
and taking friendly criticism whenever a
false move is made, and studying to im
prove yourselves and each other.
For outfit (if you do not care to buy a
gymnasium suit) wear an undershirt, an
old pair of trousers and a pair of rubber
or canvas soled shoes. You can buy a
good set of boxing gloves (eight-ounce
gloves are best) for anywhere from $1 50
to Â£5, and as your partner shares the ex
pense this is a remarkably cheap price
for the fun and instruction you will get
from them.
Having secured your outfit, you will be
ready for the first lesson, .which will ap
pear in next Friday's issue.

me with the announcement that she
wanted a divorce from her husband, who
Incidentally is a great friend of mine.
"She asserted demurely that he was
cruel to her in that he kissed her too
much. I was dumfounded, but grasping
at the chance that the tingle of the

acute as to cause annoyance, I asked if
the caress was painful. She smiled a
sweet 'no.' I then inaulred If he failed

negatively again. I had to pass.
"She finally averred that her spouse's
aggravated osculatory, habits were' having
the 1 effect of destroying, the Grecian
curves of her lips. I Informed her. in
refusing totake the case, that no sober
minded Judge would condemn her hus
band for doing what was irresistible. And
I'll guarantee that she only wanted to
have the matter come up in court so
that she could show those same rosebud
lips to the public through the news

/N the study of nature as elsewhere, familiarity
breeds contempt. The most effective natural forces
â¢work so silently and so constantly that we are in great
danger of not being: properly impressed by the magni
tude of their operations. A drop of water is. a small thing,
and each one accomplishes but the tiniest amount of
work, yet, as a "continual dropping" will -wear a stone, and
as the drops of -water which fall upon the earth are in
numerable and come down in constant succession, the to
tal work accomplished surpasses the highest flights of the
imagination.
The amount of water which falls from the clouds and
flows down to lower levels in river beds and torrential
;- 4. streams varies greatly in different parts of the world,
snd in each locality is greatly affected by special conditions. In a moun
tainous country the slope is so steep that nearly all the rainfall finds its way into
the stream beds, and comes down to the plains in torrents after every shower 1 or
every melting of the snow upon the summit. The effect of these torrents is pro
digious. Stones many feet in diameter are rapidly rolled down the steeper slopes
and even carried far out upon the plain, ar.d deep gorges are rapidly worn in the
solid rock. One will find great accumulations of bowlders spread out upon the
lowlands about the mouths of all mountain streams.
The most impressive of all gorges produced by* river erosion is that of the
Grand Canyon cf the Colorado, which for 300 miles flows in a channel of Its own
cutting 6,000 feet (or more than a miie) deep; while tributaries from either side en
ter it through narrow gorge? of equal depth. On the Pacific slope there are many
other river gorges approaching; this in magnitude.' Both forks of the American
River have cat gorges through FOlld slate from 2,000 to 3.000 feet in depth. The
oanyon of the Merced River, where it flows through the Tosemite Valley is bor
dered with perpendicular granite cliffs from 3.000 to 5,000 feet in height; while the
Grtnd Canyon of Kings River is from 3,000 to 7,000 feet in depth, which the river
has cut in hard granite.
We have been accustomed lo speak of such gorges as produced by "convul-'
sions" of nature; and there are many chasms in the earth's surface -which have *
been produced in that manner, of which the valley of the Jordan is a conspicuous
example. But the lmnressiveness of canyons produced by the steady action of
e lower causes is even greater than that of those produced by a sudden convulsion.
When one reflects upon it, however/ the process seems very simple, and the ef
fects not at ell extravagar.trfor geological time is long. If a river saws, down
through the rocks and lowers Us bed a foot in a thousand years (which is almost
Inconceivably slow) it would produce a gorge 1.000 feet deep in l.OOCMWO years;
whereas if it lowered its bed a foot Jn 200 years it would produce a canyon 5,000
feet deep in 1.000,000 years. We can easily imagine the rate to be many times
n:ore rapid. In comparision with, the river gorges which we have mentioned that
below Niagara Falls seems very insignificant and of very recent date.
The Niagara gorge, extending from Lewiston up to the present cataract, is
bat seven miles and a half long and about 300 feet deep; yet this is all the work
that has been done by that mighty river since the drainage of the great lakes
began to flow in that direction. Recent surveys have shown that the falls are
wearing back at the rate of nearly five feet a year; thus showing that. If the
present forces have been in operation constantly, this cataract cannot be over
7.000 or P.O00 years old. The Falls of St. Anthony at Minneapolis have worn back,
for the Mississippi River, a narrow gorge of similar length and dimensions and at
about the same rate. If the other gorges mentioned show by their vast extent
the great length of geological time, these gorges Illustrate by their diminutive ex
tent the rtcency of some of the most marvelous events in geologic history.

Boxing While They Are Yet Undeveloped
CAPTAIN JIMMY MILLER, bar pilot, denies it.
The qther pilots, however, take their shipmate's de
nial sadly and, with right hands raised, aver that
only Miller's modesty stands in the way of a frank
acknowledgment. - *
It happened, or didn't happen, according to whether
Miller or one of the other nineteen pilots tells the yarn, on
board the saucy cruiser Pathfinder, on which Miller makes
his cruises. v >">.-
Captain Miller prides hifl%aelf >a his strict attention to
business and on his methodical habits. When he goes to
Bleep at sea, in order that there may be no standing on
the order of his acting should circumstances require his
presence on deck,. the pilot so disposes of his wardrobe
that he can shift from pajamas to pea Jacket without any
undue waste of time. To. save the time necessary to pull
on boots or shoes Miller has provided himself with a pair
qf wooden sabots which on retiring he places in a parttcu-^ ,
lar spot at a certain angle so arranged that his feet fall Into place as he clamber^
from his bunk. \
The night of the occurrence or non^occurrence, according as before mentioned.
to who tells the yarn, Miller had been speaking of the perfection to which he had
brought his plan for making the quick change. He praised himself gently, then
Jess restrainedly, and was fairly beaming with self approval when ho rolled in be
tween the blankets and lost himself in dreamland.
"Come on deck quickly, we are in trouble," rasped in through Miller's dreams.
A strong hand shook him until the shaker was assured of the shakee'a con
sciousness. Miller was left alone. i
A few minutes later those on deck heard a/ hoarse, fear-stricken cry gurgla
from the depths of the cabin and float out into the night.
"Help! I'm paralyzed. For God's sake, help! help!"
All hands hastened below 1 . Miller was standing- by his bunk clutching a pair of
pantalod^r He was pale and serious. Cold perspiration rolled down his rugged
cheeks, corncob pipe lay lifeless at his feet.
"\ '<Boys, ; I'm done for. Can't lift a foot. Can't move an inch. Am all right
from the waist up. It's paralysis."
"Lift your foot out of that wooden shoe, Jimmy," volunteered a grinning pilot.
% What Miller/ said when he found that his wooden shoes had been secured, to
the deck by three inch screw nails is better described than, ( repeated and better
imagined than described.
Miller still denies that It happened.
The other nineteen raise nineteen weather-beaten hands and in chorus say,

SAN FRANCISCO has been in anti-Republican hands
for sev?n years. Every candidate for Mayor elected
in that time has been supported by the Examiner.
That paper has not always supported the Mayor after ins
election, for sometimes the Mayor has refused to give it
what it wanted, and then it has snapped gild snarled at his
heels. But for that period the Examiner has in one way or
another supported every Mayor that has been elected, and
to get for him votes has emitted a string of promises as
long as a comet's tail and as easily seen through. -
That paper is again in the same business at the old
stand. Not content with making promises it has descended
to a vile personal attack on Mr. Crocker. We use the word
"descended" for convenience merely. It is not descriptive of
the Examiner. That paper does not have to descend to do
foul things. It merely has to stay where it is. On Satur
day it professed the greatest anxiety for the closing of pool
rooms, of side doors to saloons,' of back rooms in drink-*
ing places, and declared that this will not be done if Mr.
Crocker is elected Mayor, but that he will continue to make
of San Francisco "a city of saloons and gambling joints and
brothels."
. In the. first place, it is in order to ask why any work in
the moral administration of the city is left undone after we
have been seven years under Mayors of the Examiner's
choosing? The Examiner says "the . struggle is still on."
Why should it be? Why have morals made no headway, in
the last seven, years, with Examiner Mayors in office, and
the whole city administration in their hands? Instead of
libeling a decent citizen the Examiner should be giving an
account oft the stewardship of its Mayors and explaining why
a single back room and side entrance is left as a lure to the
innocent and unwary. â¢
The Examiner's man, Schmitz, has been Mayor for two
years. Nothing has surpassed the cordiality of his relations
with Hearst and the Examiner. He even went into the
campaign for Hearst in New York fevhen he was the candi
date of the stews and slums for Congress, the favorite of the
bawds and cullies. Now Hearst says that Schmitz has
left the town wide open arid that Crocker will. leave it so,
while Lane will close it, airtight. AH that is one side of
Mr. William Randolph Hearst's attack on Mr. Henry J.
Crocker. But there is another side to it that i tnay.be treated
with less patience. Mr. Hearst closes his personal attack
on Mr. Crocker with this paragraph:
"Now which do the voters want? The choice is' with
them. Mr. ; Crocker has made his promise .to the tender
loin. Mr. Lane has made his pledges to the home. What
do the moral teachers of the city think of the situation?
How will ihey advise their followers to vote? The Exam
iner does not believe San Francisco is ready to surrender
itself to the gamblers and brothel mongers. We do not
want a wid^open town. If you are for decency and moral
ity, for right living and home protection, Lane's the man."
Men whose children bear their names and are not reared
by the actors' or other charity fund need no moral guardian
ship by Mr. Hearst. Mr. Crocker is a decent and upright
citizen, Whose domestic.- virtues stand out in sharp contrast
with the practices of Mr. Hearst. Their paths lie apart, as
have their practices. Mr. Crocker's leads to .his home, his
accuser's to the nasty trail of a moral leper. " /â¢-.->
The people of San Francisco know the effects of evil
example, and they have not forgotten that all good fathers
and mothers breathed freer when the worst moral pustule
we ever had burst in New York! They do not look to that
source for moral guidance. They have tried Examiner
Mayors for seven years, only to have that paper warn them
as an expert that the city is morally fiithy and can only be
saved by electing anfcther Examiner Mayor. They want no
more of that kind, and will resent this virulent and libelous
attack on Mr. Crocker by. making his majority the largest
that has been cast in a city election.
PRINCE VICTOR NAPOLEON, pretender to the
throne of France, has sent out from his so-called court
at Brussels a plaintive plea to be allowed to-shift from
his shoulders the claim to sovereignty which is his and to
return to the land of his birth, there to die as a citizen of
the republic. He declares that, though he may be the head
of the Bonaparte. family, he has no rights to dispose of, for
it is only' through' the will of all France that he could ever
mount the throne; he is only the natural candidate for an
Emperor. Now that the misfortune of birth has condemned
him to eternal exile, which can only be commuted by the
grace of the French Government, the homesick Prince would
feign put away foreve'r the dim shadow.of the first Napoleon's
ermine if that would propitiate the pmvers of France.
Just one hundred years ago Napoleon Bonaparte wa3
First Consul â¢ of France. Arcola and Rivoli had been
fought. The St. Bernard Pass had been crossed. Mantua
had fallen and the puissance of Austria brought to dust at
Marengo. Already the terrible hand of the little corporal
had begun to mold the map of Europe. England across
the channel was frantically building her wooden walls to
keep the Corsican from leaping /the ditch. Master of the
finest army in the world, complete despot of a country in
toxicated with the delirium of military success/ and, like
Alexander, believing himself to be. a god, Napoleon, was
already reaching for the purple of supreme empire- (
Now with a century gone the world is treated to the
pitiable spectacle of a shadow man seeking to. renounce a
shadow throne. Mewed up in Brussels with a handful of
faithful followers, having scarcely enough cash to keep the
kettle on the fire', hungering for a sight of the Paris from
which he is interdicted^ the last Napoleon becomes the
humble suppliant. Prince Victor never saw a battlefield; he
knows not the least rudiments of government; he is a stran
ger to the French people. He knows grand 'opera, how
ever, and can be at ease in a literary salon. They say he
can ride with grace. But the weary years of waiting and of
hoping against hope, hoping for one of France's sudden po
litical changes of heart which might carry him to the throne,
have at last broken this unfortunate wisp of a pretender and
he has now given up the fight. '
It is not at all probable that Victor's piteous request will
be granted by the Deputies. From the time when. Louis
Napoleon resigned his position/ on the London police force
and went over to the coast of France, there to let fly a
moulting eagle and draw his grandfather's sword, French
republicans have been distrustful of things Napoleonic. It
would seem, however, that they need have no fear. The
Bonapartist faction is about dead through senile decay. So
long has the Third Republic now-stood. on its feet that what
was accepted as a compromise in the dark days of the Com
mune has grown to be a reasonably stable Government. The
unfortunate Victor would probably cause less commotion on
the Parisian boulevards than an American millionaire seeing
the town.

publish them, nor do they perform their
kindnesses In that manner. During the
campaign nsÂ«* like counsel for the con
testants declared that I did not know the
law, that I was no lawyer at all. bat now
he has just paid me the compliment of
sayin- that I am a lawyer. Let htm make
every presumption that can be alleged
â¢gainst a lawyer In such a situation.
There Is no evidence that Mr. Bennett
ever consulted me upon law matters.
Our friendship was personal, political and
tn the way of business."
In the remainder of bis speech- Bryan
discussed Bennett's iseturn to New York,
where he executed the win. placed It In
a *axe deposit vault and left It there
without alteration for three rears, al
though he had every opportunity to make
s^cb. changes as he might have desired.
He concluded bis speech of more thaa aa
hoar's length wttb. a trCmte to Be&nett's
character and to his memory.
"It Is Inctnnbent npon me to respond to
s<j nrnch of the arstiment as comes un
der thÂ» brad of facts. There has been
ncthlng of the presentation of evidence
to justify ns In the expectation that the
will would be attacked en the ground of
undue faith. If It had been known mat
that point would be presented we should
have presented testimony on that point.
There was no such Intimation In the tes
timony. But I am not surprised at the
language csed by Jodge Stoddard, nor
surprised that he has sought to draw spch
Inferences as he has. I wrote the widow
the letter that I did becaase I believed
In other causes than law. I aia not stir
prised that he falls to comprehend the
Interest In my principles which my friend
Bennett felt.
Bryan arose to his feet as Stoddard
concluded, and In stillness that was all
most oppressive began speaking. He
said:
â¢That sealed letter speaks falsely, for
It do*s not tell the truth of the arrange
ment between Mr. Bennett and Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan. A solemn letter addressed
to the wife of Mr. Bennett secretes from
her the fact tiat JM.OW was going to the
wife of this man. Why was It? Did It
enter Into their calculations tiat Mrs.
Bennett might object? Mr. Bryan knew
perfectly well that the provisions of that
section of the will are proscribed by law.
In the Ehadow of her husband's death Mr.
Bryan made an offer to Mrs. Bennett tiat
when, as trustee, she should pay to him
the JS).W> bequest he would do certain
things set forth in his letter to her, read
In the testimony a few days ago- He
said he did not expect a contest. That Is
incredible In a lawyer writing himself
heir to $5>.â¬0*> In a friend's win. The let
ter which he wrote foreshadows that he
feared a contest. That letter introduced
here to-night, after the contest had come.
when it was apparent tiat he was not
going to ?etÂ»that money, caused him to
make one last despairlne effort to get
that widow to permit him to do as he
pleased with the S9X.CO7.
"Except I saw It under his own hand
writing-. It wculd be Incredible that any
lawyer could write such a letter as this.
What ri?ht has Mr. Bryan tr> Intimate
that I am unfaithful to my client or that
I am unfair to my oath because of some
miserable difference tn political beliefs?
Why does he go behind my back and say
this to my client? He makes reference
to attorney's fees. To my mind. It marks
the morality of the man. It shows how
desperately he wwas driven In avarice to
get this S30.CC0.
"Another branch of the case Is abso
lutely decisive, and that Is the le^a!
phase of the question. This sealed letter
feature is a device that brands the whole
transaction. It won't answer under the
law that Mr. Bryan did not ask for the
gift."
"Is it any wonder then that when Mr.
Brvan found himself confronted wtth this
situation, when thtÂ» matter came up be
tween himself and Mr. Bennett, he would
not permit Mr. Bennett to make provis
ions directly to his family? But this
sealed letter does not state Mr. Bennett's
wilL It states Mr. Bryan's will. It waj
to Mr. Bryan's desire that Mr. Bennett
yielded. Why, no man knows.
"Mr. Bryan would not have it and tie
reason is plain. Mr. Bryan Is a lawyer.
It has never b>een In this State, nor where
the Law controls, that a lawyer can
write himself br'r to a considerable for
tune in the will of his friend whic^i he
prepares. To permit It would be a dis
grace In any system of jurt3prudence.

ence which he exerted was not undue.

cited law In support of the contention
that the will as found was valid in law,
and that o:her forms called for by rtat
ute had b*en followed.
Attorney Stmidard then began his argu
ment. After reviewing Bryan's tsstimeny.
?tven last week. Stoddard referred to
Mrs. Bryan's training in law and to tHe
fact that both Mr. and Mrs. Bryan are
lawyers. He said tn part:
"Mr. Bryan and his wife, with Mr. Ben

you that we consider San Francisco the

To CBt down the time cf actual per

A^ostino sang the music appreciatively

There was no opportunity to make a dull
performance with t<**Â« combination; in

contrary, it gained steadily after the first

"Un Balic in ilaschera" is at once, a dra

The post cf â csor naturally fell to
Gregoretti. who has the most dramatic

Â¦ Sold by All Reliable Dealers.Major Ducat reports that the First
Regiment, encamped at Santa Rosa, did
Its work j well. He noted that the Fifth
Infantry, at Camp Warfleld, Healdsburg,
appeared to fair advantage, although the
camp was a little untidy, and the soldiers
had no chaplain, no target" practice and
no practice marches. Hats were worn In
all shapes and positions and the men were
noisy In town. .
These faults, he pointed out, â¢ could be
corrected '. by the officers. , He remarks
that the Idea of serving claret punch to
the men after drill was an excellent, one
and there was no drunkenness. The ma
jor says Troop D, Cavalry,' encamped In
Los Angeles County, is an excellent com
mand. He also compliments the First
Battalion, Coast Artillery, which was en
camped at Stockton, but thinks the men
should do their own cooking and not hire
servants to do it. He says In physique
the National Guard Is not up to the stand
ard of the regular army. The report,
while in places slightly censorious in tone,
nevertheless generally compliments the
militiamen for being of excellent material.

NEWPORT, R. I., Oct. 2G.-Mr. and
Mrs. Peter D. Martin ran the risk of a
serious accident to-day to save a care
less wheelman from being oadly hurt. In
their automobile they dashed upon the
sidewalk opposite the Casino, escaped a
stone wall by only a few inches, and
while Mrs. Martin in great fear clung
to her husband's neck, lest she be thrown
from her seat, he guided the machine
safely around the bicyclist until he
reached the middle of the street again.
Mr. and Mrs. Martin were riding up
Bellevue avenue In their automobile when
a runabout . got In their way. Martin
turned out sharply to avoid It, but only
to find In; his path a man on a 'bicycle,
riding, so close to the vehicle that he
had not been seen. The runabout, the
automobile and the bicycle were going
so fast that neither could stop and there
was nothing for Martin to do but make
another sharp turn to the left, which
carried his automobile up over the curb
stone.
The machine struck the curbstone with
a hard bump and air. and Mis. Martin
were nearly thrown out. The* bicycle
rider' did not stop, so his name could
not be learned. Those who saw the affair
gave Martin much credit ror his plucky
and skillful handling of his automobile.
Mrs. Martin 'Vraa formerly Miss Lily

Says Stanford University Is Unpre
pared to Make Exhibit.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 26.â
The board of trustees of Stanford Uni
versity has decided not to make a uni
versity exhibit at the St. Louis fair: at
least, if Stanford is represented, it will
not be through a general exhibit, but one
dealing with some special feature of the
work here. President Jordan when asked
to-night in regard to the reasons for this
decision arrived at by the board said:
We have never exhibited and I have no
funds at my disposal for that purpose. "We
are not ready yet to make an exhibit that
would do justice to the institution, and shall
not be until the buildings are completed.
I referred the matter to a committee of tho
board of trustees and they thought it best not
to make such an exhibit until we are thor
oughly prepared to tiw so. I asked the com
mittee to consider the possibility of doing jus
tice to some feature of the university without
making a general exhibit, but the committee
has not reported a* yet.
There has been no formal refusal on our part
to exhibit except by way of default, if that
can be no considered.

ST. HELENS, Or.. Oct. '26.â The ship
Two Brothers, which left here for San
Francisco a few days ago with a cargo
of lumber, is In bad condition, although
she will probably be able to reach her
destination safely.
The Two Brothers was at Vancouver,
Wash., for nearly two months, taking on
lumber. Finally it was decided to bring
the vessel to St. Helens and complete her
cargo, but a large part of the lumber had
to be unloaded to enable the vessel to
be moved. The vessel draws eighteen
feet and two towboats drew her along
the bed of the Columbia River where the
water was sixteen and a half feet deep.
After the vessel had been anchored here
for about three weeks it was discovered
that she was leaking, but the break could
not be located. The vessel then made
ready to pull out. although she lacked
about 200,000 feet of having lumber enough
to complete her 1.500,000 feet cargo.
Vessel Sticks in Mud on the Co
lumbia and Begins
Leaking.

The Polytechnic High refused to play
Lowell yesterday at the Presidio athletic
grounds. The "Pollys" claim the sub
final championship and therefore forfeited
the game. At a meeting Saturday morn
ing it was decided that Lick, Polytechnic
and Lowell should cast lots to see which
should play first. It fell to Lowell to meet
Polytechnic and the winner to play Lick
to-day.
The "Pollys" agreed to play, but pro
tested on the ground that they were en
titled to the sub-final championship. Her
bert Gould, president of the Amateur Ath
letic League, advised the team not to play
Lowell, as by so doing it would forfeit Its
protest. Mr. Gould, it is -said, exceeded
his authority considerably by such advice,
for, it is claimed, Polytechnic has lost to
Lowell whether its protest is accepted or
not.
The referee called game and the Lowell
team kicked off to empty fields.
Lowell and Lick will meet this after
noon.

Former to Enter Professional Bing
at Beliance Club.
Local ssortdom. Is Interested in the
meeting to-night at the Reliance Club,
Oakland, between Joe Millet and Al Wei
nig of Buffalo. They will box fifteen
rounds and the outcome will be watched
with Interest, as the winner is likely to
be matched with the victor of the Fltz
simmons-Gardner contest. /
Millet is well known In local affcletic
circles and he appeared In many contests
here before he went to Honolulu. His
appearance to-night marks his advent In
professional circles and the bout Is sÂ«re
to be a lively one, as his opponent is
known as one who can stand plenty of
punishment.
Millet and Weinig have trained faith
fully for the contest and there has been
plenty of betting. Most of the wagers are
at even money and it is doubtful if odds
will be offered either way.
The first preliminary to-nrght will be
between Jack Evans and Fred Turner,
the bout being for four rounds. The prin
cipal preliminary will be a ten-round con
test between George Brown of the West
Oakland Club and George Carter of
Stockton. Both men are looked upon as
clever and aggressive fighters and a lively
go is expected.

AQUEDUCT RACE TRACK. N. Y.. Oct.
2ti.â The racing Ht the newly built mile
and a quarter track at Aqueduct to-day
resolved itsolf into a carnival of long
shots. At 100 to 1 Athlana won the first
race, which was a six furlongs handicap.
Id the second race the SO to 1 shot. Mel*.
terslnger, was third. In the fifth a 40 to
1 shot von, a MO to 1 chance was second
tl.r.d at 300 to 1 AriFkany was third. In
fact the laÂ« named entry was beaten
only by a few feet by the winner. If
Artekany, which Is a cast off from John
BanfortTa stable, had come home first
the famous May G affair of a year ago
at tho same track would have been ay
luoached.
Sl-edal IHypetrh to ThÂ» Call
A mile and a quarter selling run, for
which Chub ruled favorite, concluded the
sport. Cambaceres cut out a merry clip
for more than a mile. Then, under Pow
ell's urging, Chub responded, finally being
returned a shifty winner over El Oriente
in 2:07. Erne was never a contender.
F. E. MULHOLLAND.
The judges took cognizance that things
supernatural were doing, sent the horses
back to the paddock, ordered Dwightway
watched and gave -the ring twenty min
utes to make a new book. Later Charles
Goodman, the colored trainer and ex
steeplechase rider, the gelding's trainer,
was ruled off the turf. lie will now have
time to study up on prescriptions.
It was ladies' day again, but the attend
ance was not as large as usual. There
was no harness event and of the six run
ning races favorites took four.
Iva Powell is the Odom of the game
down here and about every mount of his
is installed favorite by the bookmakers.
He had the leg up on Ismad, a brother to
Dr. Shorb, .in the opening event and at
odds'of 3 to 2; the gelding displayed about
as much speed as a legless man climbing
Mount Lowe. Connell played a one-night
stand out in front and then retired. In
the run home j Martin Brady, the second
choice, ran circles around his field, beat
ing Honduran and Bicycle six open
lengths. This marks Schreiber's first wins
at the meeting.
Miss Vera, piloted by Powell, captured
the seven-furlong affair next decided. On
dope her chances did not look so easy, but
Powell used excellent Judgment, landing
the mare an easy winner over Iras and
Teufel. Achilles received wise backing,
but disappointed his admirers.
On the strength of her handy third to
Kenilworth and Blissful in the Pasadena
stake, Durbar looked a good thing for the
third number, a five and a half furlong
spin, and was held an even money
chance throughout the betting. The start
was not one of Duke's happiest efforts,
but the favorite was so much the best
she won any way. Big Bill Knapp skirted
the bunch, and catching the leaders at
the end of the stand scored almost easily
from Metlakatla. Step Around was left
and Nona B finished third. Â¦
Heather Honey, the cheap purchase
made at the Chinn and Forsythe sale last
spring, is quite a filly these days. She
was made a 1 to 2 favorite for the mile
selling affair and after a none too pleas
ant voyage took the front position In the
string, and, with Kunz doing his worst,
won by two lengths. Knapp brought Mir
acle H from behind, disposing of Dug
Martin for place honors. Position had
some early speed.
There was no pronounced favorite for
the five-furlong scramble, fifth on the
programme. It resolved down to a drive
between Mary Nance and Neti.e May,
arid See on the former mare outgeneraled
Kunz, getting a â¢nose verdict. Roltaire
finished third and with better racing luck
could have won.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26.â More than
likely the record of Dick Welles would have
gone a-glimmerlng this afternoon at Ag
ricultural Park had the judges permitted
Dwightway to have started in the second
race. It took three men to lead him on
the track and he had all the appearance
of a four-year-old gelding that had been
given the reserve barrel of a pneumatic
dope gun. ' Hilderbrand was scared and
slid off the animal's back.

ClementÂ© Pierce yesterday engaged
stalls for Charles Dwyer, who will leave
New York In a fortnight with all of his
string excepting the great Africander,
Â¦which has been on the shelf for the last
month or two. This will make an im
portant acquisition. to the racing material
that will be on hand this winter.
The members of the committee have given
this question a great deal of consideration and
we are of the unanimous opinion that the con
tention of the committee of the National Asso
ciation with respect to this matter Is not Jus
tified by any provision of the national agree
ment nor by any action of the representatives
of either party to Its discussion at Buffalo and
Cincinnati previous to its final adoption.
Regarding the contention of the committee
representing the National Association relative
to sales, agreements, purchases and contracts
for and with players for 1904. made prior to
September 11. 1903. It is contended by Messrs.
Powers, Farrell and Sexton, the committee that
represented the National Association when the
national agreement was adopted, that all sales,
agreements and purchases and contracts for
and with players for 1904 by club members of
said association, made prior to September 11,
1003. the day of the adoption of the national
agreement, are binding and cannot be disturbed,
and that article 6, Bectlon 6 of the national
agreement providing for the drafting of play
ers does not apply to these cases.
Rule 23 provides that there shall be no
purchases of releases of players made
during the drafting period and that such
purchases would not be allowed as
against the draft of any auch players. It
was held that section 8 of the national
agreement was conflicting with section 6
and a definite Interpretation was made so
that the drafting period will -be from Sep
tember 1 to October 15, with no sales per
mitted during that time.
After the commission adjourned the fol
lowing official document was given out:
The most important work of the day
was the decision establishing the absolute
right of the major leagues to draft play
ers from the minor leagues, and when
this matter was settled It carried with it
results affecting most of the twenty-one
contests presented for players.
Two additional rules. Nos. 24 and 25,
were added to the national agreement.
Rule 24 provides that each club must
send to the secretary of the national com
mission before August 24 in each year a
list of Its purchased players and that no
one on such list can ever be claimed after
that date.
Among those who appeared before the
commission during the day were H. W.
Lucas, president of the Pacific National
League; H. M. Sexton, president of the
Western League, and R. R. Burke of
Denver.
CINCINNATI, O., Oct. 26.â The national
baseball commission, with Chairman Au

The Board of Supervisors yesterday
granted a soecial permit to the San
Francisco Athletic Club to bring off a
boxing contest In this city on November
10. The only member thui voted against
the permit waa Supervisor Brandenstein.
The permit waa granted In order to al
low Jimmy Britt, the local lightweight,
and Charley Seiger, the Italian boxer, to
battle. They were scheduled to meet last
month, but a week before the contest
Britt Injured his foot and the bout had
to be declared off. In order to bring about
a meeting of the pair friends of Britt and
the club secured the special permit.
Britt has recovered from his Injury and
is now in training. He played handball
at the Olympic Club yesterday afternoon
with Sammy Berger. the crack amateur
heavy-weight, and beat him In clever
fashion. Britt wore a rubber stocking on
his foot and plaved the violent game
without fear of hurting the member.- He
says It Is in perfect shape and he will be
able to keep his engagement with Seiger.
Jimmy weighed in at 133 pounds after
exercising. He will go over to Croll's
Gardens to-morrow and begin training.
Seiger has been working at the Beach
and as he is down to weight he will be in
splendid shape when the meeting takej

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 26.â According to
Major A. C. Ducat of the Seventh In
fantry, United States army, the National
Guard of California is in good shape, but
needs a bit of instruction in camp duties.
Major Ducat, who was detailed by the
adjutant general of the army to visit the
encampments of the California militia,
to-day filed a voluminous report with
Governor Pardee. He chides the soldiers
for military sins of omission and com
mission, running from failure to air their
blankets to appearing In front of a fash
ionable hotel at Coronado in ridiculous
costumes.' ..
With respect to the Sixth Regiment,
camped at Santa Cruz in August, Major
I>ucat said the drills were not good and
the arms generally were in bad condition.
Tents were defaced by names and marks
and is some cases the men wore on their
blouses no less than three kinds of but
tons.
The major discovered that the officers
of the Second Infantry had : a sideboard,
where they could get liquid refreshments
by paying for them pro rata, but there
was no canteen for the men. j

Rheumatism
p Is Not a SKin Disease.
Most people have an idea that rheumatism ia contracted like a cold, that the
damp, chuly air penetrates the muscles and joints and causes the terrible aches
and pains, or that it is something like a 6kin disease to be rubbed away with lini-
ment or drawn out with plasters; but Rhuematism originates in the blood and is
caused by Urea, or Uric Acid, an irritating, corroding poison that settles in mus-
cles, joints and nerves, producing inflammation and soreness and the sharp, cutting
pains peculiar to this distressing disease. _

No harm ! It leaves the
skin soft like a baby's ; no

none,
What is bad soap ? Im-
perfectly made; the fat

Captain Mclntyre and a number of the sur
vivors of the wrecked steamer South Portland
are coming here Â¦ from Bandon on the steam
schooner Chlco. which Is due some time to-day.
Conservative men of the shipping world are
Inclined to reserve their Judgment on Captain
Mclntyre's conduct in making his own safety
the first consideration, but on the facts so far
known he will have a hard time explaining
the curious part he' played In the abandon
ment. In discussing Mclntyre frequent ref
erence is made to brave Captain Ward of the
steamship Rio de . Janeiro, whose death was a
fulfillment of the noblest traditions of the
sea. After tbe Rio struck Ward used -his au
thority to maintain discipline and to his last
heroic efforts many passengers on the Ill-fated
liner owe their lives. Of his own life ha took
no account. When he had done all he could
he retired to his cabin and when the Rio sank
her skipper was still at hie post.
Not Like Ward of the Rio.

The news that the old brig Tanner had gone
ashore at Port Angeles and probably would
prove a total loss was received yesterday In
the local shipping world with considerable in
terest. The Tanner was about the oldest and
one of the most picturesque vessels on the Pa
cific. In 1S55. when she was launched at
Smlthtown, N. Y., she was as tight and saucy
a brig as ever flew the stars and strlpea. For
ty-eight years of sea service, however, trans
formed the Tanner Into a floating sieve in
which no sallorman less brave than her
ekipper and' owner. Captain Newhall, would
have dared to venture beyond easy reach of a
life-saving station. The Tanner was equipped
with an enormous windmill which operated a
pump that, aided materially In keeping her
afloat. When the windmill got out of order
the ordinary hand pump lacked the capacity to
handle the water that leaked through her
eeams and the Tanner was in constant trou
ble. In spite of her age and openwork hull,
however. Captain Newhall kept his old brig
In active commission and made long ocean
voyages in her long after the surveyors had
gl\en her up as a hopeless derelict. Captain
Newhall who managed to escape with his life
in this "latest mishap to the brig. Is an old
man. Years ago he gave up the command of
the bark Amelia at the solicitation of his
daughter, who thought her fathtx, .at that
time too old for the rigorous life of the sea,
He said good-by to the ocean and became ln
teieÂ«ted in the logging business. Life" ashore,
however proved Irksome to the ancient mari
ner and' when the opportunity presented Itself
he bought the Tanner and has stayed with her
ever since.
Passing: of the Brig Tanner.

The British ship Peter Iredale was cleared
yesterday for Ipswich. England, with 07.521

at ?1575 and consisted .of 718 ctls barley,

Stanford University may not be repre
sented . at the St. Louts Exposition. The
University of California, Its rival, will
have a large, exhibit, illustrative of Its
situation, its proposed extensive building
scheme, its present institution, its work
and all appertaining to it.
Professor Furlong, who Is authorized by
the California Commissioners to the St.
Louis Exposition to collect educational
exhibits, has received a letter from Presi
dent David Starr Jordan in which the lat
ter says, in substance, that to advertise
the university would not be In accordance
with the wishes of one of the founders.
This letter has excited consternation. The
glories of Stanford University have shed
luster on this State, and all university
life In California has been brightened and
intensified by the Institution of a rival for
the State University at Berkeley. Profes
sor Brown of Berkeley has written a let
ter to President Jordan to see If Stanford
will not exhibit.
Professor Furlong Is hopeful that some
way will be provided to have Stanford
make the showing at St. Louis of which
It is capable. The matter is still undecid
ed, so far as Professor Furlong was in a
position to speak yesterday. There are
thousands of graduates of Stanford who
will regret It if their university keeps out
of sight at St. Louis. This regret will be
shared by the people of the whole State,
who see In the existence of Stanford a
great attraction to draw people to Califor
nia.
President Says a Display
Would Displease One
' ? S , of the Founders.
Stanford Will Probably
Not Be Represented
at St. Louis.

I Save $18
9 Going East. ;
I Here are some figures .which show how much f
1 money is saved by traveling in a tourist sleeping car. \
I The first-qlass rate California to Chicago is $62.50;
1 berth in standard sleeping car, $14.00. Total, $76.50.
B Second-class rate $52.50; berth in tourist sleeping
I car, $6.00. Total, $58.50. Saving $18.00.
I To points east of Chicago, the difference is still t
H greater; to points west, it is a little less.
H When you consider that no sacrifice of self respect Â£
i is involved in "going tourist" and that you have almost
H all the conveniences and comforts of a standard sleeper, |
I it is easy to realize why 80 per cent of the people who
1 cross the continent, make the trip in a tourist sleeper. .

the building:, and the Ralston Iron

The cool, foggy weather added to the dull

had but slight r variation. Receipts of Grapes
In small packages were rather light, and some
exceptionally, fine lots In crates, sold up to 75c.

of *urMciouis inquiry into banking and trust

the- oi.'trators In Hocks are encouraged from
this to feel a confidence that other failures

Most kinds of Vegetables arrived too late
for tbe recular trade, but there were ample
supplies of carrled-over stock, which moved
off well at steady rates. The canners were
not buylns Tomatoes and as a result there
was tiulte a surplus unsold at the close.
The Potato market was liberally supplied
and quiet, and Salinas Burbanks were quoted
at a wider range. There w-v some inquiry
for low priced river Burbaf.kn for shipment
to the Southwest, but as there was no such
stock available there was no movement in that
direction. Sweets were plentiful and ea*y.
Two cars of the Merced article were on sale.
Onions were abundant and only fancy stock
was in demand.

FAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 26 â 5 p. m.
Weather Report.
CHICAGO, Oct. 26. â The opening in wheat
gave promise of a bulge, Liverpool cables show
ing better prices and a big advance being re
ported at St. Louis. There was good general
buying of both December and May at the start,
the former month opening and % to % and
% higher at 81%c to 81%c, with May about
steady. A eood deal of long wheat came out
on the advance, and there was also selling for
short account, and when a break occurred at
St. Loul3 the market here also declined. Large
world's shipments and favorable weather were

The continued liberal shipments from Rus

wheat from Australia, which country has been

were the hot bear factors. December declined
to 81c, but a rally in the last hour recovered
much of the . loss, December closing with a
gain of %OVic, at Sl%c.
Support was lacking in the corn market and
prices ruled weak. The excellent weather was
the principal bear factor, December closing
%c lower at 44%c.
Oats also suffered from lack of trade and
in sympathy with corn. December closed with
a loss of %c. at 36*ic.
Provisions had an easier undertone, due to
selling by packers in the absence of any ma
terial support. The close was easy, with Jan
uary i>ork 7%c lower, lard off 2%c and ribs
down 2%c.

particular change. The world's shipments for
the week were as ! follows, in quarters : . : Rus
sian. 024,000; Argentine, 15,000; Indian,
231,000. The American visible supply in
creased 1S9.000 bushels.
Chicago was firm, but not materially
changed. The export demand was reported
improving, with a brisk foreign demand at
Duluth and 30 loads worked at New York.
In this market futures were higher, as the
December shorts were getting anxious over
the outlook and were buying to cover. Cash
grain j was firm, but unchanged. The ship
pers are not doing | much in the interior, as
growers' views are above their limits, and
they are mainly confining their purchases to
moderate lots for stiffening ships.

American Adaptabaity.
Lady Curxan. the vicerine of India,
stands as a shining example of the facil
ity and the adaptability of the American
woman. Occupying a position which
brings her fn. continual contact wita roy
alty, she bears herself with as much dig
nity and distinction as if she had been
born to the purple. No daughter of the
reigning house of Great Britain eoxxM
sustain herself in the place of Lady Car
son with more admirable poise than she
exhibits in all of the great functions In
which she is caHed to figure. Lady Cur
zon belongs to what would be called a
new" family, even la America. She has
not behind her the. generations of culture
which many American women can point
to. She was brocgbt np fn Chicago, a
town that is consplcuoaaly associated
with the commercial idea. Her acqfuirf
tlocs were not aided' by '-he influence of
hereditary culture.. Her achievements are
the fruit of a keen and active mind and
an agreeable personality under the spar
and encttarag'effient of liberal advantages.
Her accommodation to the requirements
and the opportunities of large riches
shows thÂ« difference between the British
and the American systems. In England It
requires centuries to manufacture the
sort of . ladles and . gentlemen who are
often developed ia this country ta a "'sin

Almost Every Part cf the Costume
Host Be Adorned With
It is only a very few years ago that it
was considered bad taste far women in
English society ta wear jewelry in tee
daytime, says thÂ« London Express. Now
it is fash icnabte to wear not only dia
monds and pearls with afternoon costumes
but at33 a variety of other rems. The
craie.fcr barbaric jewtlry was perhaps
accountable for this departure in the first
instance. \
At any rate, at any society fenctian
nowadays a full dres3 costtane is not com
plete without a dlamcnd chain cr pearl
collar/ while breeches, pendants and
trinkets of turquoise, sapphires, rsbies
or emeral-i* in conjtincticn wtth the dain

turquoise bcttaos are always to be seen.
Even for momins wear tie simpZe skirt

Jeweled hatriru are popular wedding
gifts. Jeweled waist belts and hanging
pcrses are also mnch in vocze. while the
long- picture earrings, which have been
in fashion barely one season, are cftea
seen in the daytime as well as at even
ing i?artfe3.
Tnrq[Tioises of every conceivable size and
irresroiartty and pearls of all shapes have
been the fashion for some time Bast.
A new stana for day wear is the New
Zealand stone, which, as an adienct ta
the barbaric pearl so much fcs favor, is
charmhrg wear.

One hears cften cf this or that town
cr cf certain sections that are "sreat
manufacturing centers." and the public
is apt to associate manufacturing , -with
provincial areas filled with immense fac
tory buildings, with nearby "quarters" or
tenements' or boarding-houses for the
operatives. And there Is an all too com
mon notion ta this country that city ii'a
Is "all ptoy and no work." But the big
gest cities are- by far the greatest "manu
facturing centers'* In this country, the
greatest tivea of toil in the world.
Take Chicago, fcr instance. One hun
dred and sixty thousand women in that
city "go to business" or work every
morning. It Is a great army of "em
ployes in petticoats." Against this army
in s&Irts is an army of S0O,CtiO men In al!
lines of professional and manual work.
But steadily the_anny in skÂ±rt3 Is galn

is scarcely an employment open to man

A wild, Txareasosing panic often seizes upon men fn the presence ef
danger, or even when danger is only imagined. A&ang the lower ani-
mals the greater the intelligence they possess the mere they are scb-
ject to terror. It is said that elephants tremhle at the sight of a monse,
and horses, which are credited with more intelligence than most doaes-
; tic anJTTinls ? show mere fear.
In the picture cf Adolph Schreyer, reprcdTiced in The Call art Â«xrp-
; pi ement. there is vividly depicted a stampede cf terror-stricken horses
from a Burning stable. In their blind gallop into the darkness they have
crashed into a barrier and are plunging and straggling in confusion,
t seme entangled in the splintered wood, while others crowd upon them. It
j iÂ« a scene which gave the artist abtmdant oppcrtnnity for dramatic effect
and vigorous action. He hn^ also displayed his ability as a colorist. In
its variety and richness of color the greatest merit lies, and its color
makes this picture cne of the artist'* masterpieces.
Bomantic tendencies are strong in all cf Schreyer's painting, and
sentiment, color and effect were more important to him than accurate
draftsmanship. He possessed the power to express strongly what he felt
more than the ability to depict truthfully what" he saw.

Morrow confesses that he never thought
of comparing his returns from Alcatraz
with those from Washington, and that
felons might have forged their way to
freedom for an indefinite period without
his knowledge. He says he inought his
clerk kept such matters in his head.
It is rumored at Washington, D. C.
that an investigation of the escapes of
the Alcatraz felons will be conducted by
officers not connected with this depart
ment. It is rumored also that some local
army officers may lose their commissions
as a resuUt of the affair.
"I cannot give you those names," said
Colonel Andrews yesterday. "I am not
at liberty to give you that list of men,"
said Major Morrow.
To what extent fraudulent documents
havÂ© been .passing through the offices of
Andrews and Morrow Is only a matter of
conjecture. Officers not involved in the
scandal hint that the prospective investi
gation will show that the practice of re
leasing convicts on fictitious documents
has. been going on for some time. It Is
not thought that the heads of any local
army offices have been guilty of criminal
action, however.
The methods of conducting Government
business in local army offices has resulted,
it is believed, not only in the release of
convicts Stokes, Moore, White. Darling
and Williams from Alcatraz prison but
many more desperate criminals. The of
ficers at army headquarters in the Phelan
building refuse to furnish any information
relative to the jail delivery.
It is a fact, however, that counterfeits
of Government documents have passed
through the offices of Colonel Andrews,
assistant adjutant general, and of Major
Morrow, judge advocate. These officers
decline to state thÂ© names of thÂ© convicts
that have been released from Alcatraz
within tha last ten months. A compari
son of these names with those ordered re
leased as shown by the Government
records at Washington would establish
the number of, prisoners that escaped by
means of forgery, but the names are be
ing withheld by the local officers.
Judge Graham also granted a divorce
to Heien B. Lewellen from Sidney Lewel
]en for desertion, and Agnes Bokaritz
from Peter Bnkaritz for cruelty. Judge
Troutt granted Lois Matthews a divorce
from W. A. Matthews on the ground of
cruelty. Matthews is a clerk in "the
freight department of the Santa Fe Rail
road. He was extremely jealous of his
wife, the testimony shows, and one night
after a wordy war at their home over her
conduct at a dance, he put her out into
the street. She was compelled to* remain
rut several hours, though clad only in her
n!pht dress.
Divorces were also granted to Delia
Wise frcm David Wise for desertion and
Maud Isabel Bradford from Frank Brad
ford for desertion.
Nicola Leone, who on June IS last was
â¢married to Alfonslna I^eona, wants the
marriage annulled. He says that after
the defendant became his wife he discov
ered that she was mentally incompetent.
Suits for divorce were filed by Mary E.
Robinson againct W. Robinson for cru
elty, O. M. Allen against L. B. Allen for
neglect. Albert W. B^nseman against Ju
lia Benseman fcr cruelty. Edward J.
Preston against Mary L. Preston for de
sertion and Joseph C. Lcw!s against Mary
E. Lewis for desertion.

Agnes Moran, who was but 16 years of
.sg-e when she married James Moran, a.
railroad man, at Ogden two years ago,
was granted a divorce from him by Judge
Graham on the ground of cruelty. She
.-was also awarded the custody of their
'child.
Howard saj-s he was as nice as could
be to the old lady, allowing her to eat
at his table several times a day. notwith
standing that her presence galled him.
Finally, he ?ays, when he could no longer
brook her interference in his family af
fairs, be. as gently as possible and with
due regard for the old lady's age and
sensitiveness, picked her up bodily and
carried out of the house.
Whether she returned is not stated by
Howard. Continuing, he alleges that his
married life has been made most miser
able by the conduct of his wife. He says
she persisted in associating with women
of loose character, even after he had
deeded to hrr their household effects, she
agreeing at the time the d^ed was made
to forsake the ways of her companions
and become once more a loving wife.
Howard says she has not kept her prom
ise and he wants, therefore, to be di
â¢vorced from her and the deed to the per
sonal property annulled.

Cuen, a vitopathist. A fÂ«Â»w weeks sfter
Xh* arrival Qsborne and McCuen eventual
ly went to Stockton to practice vitopathv.
When Osborne returned to San Mateo, he
alleges, he discovered that his wife had,
in hip abs^noe. been receiving the atten
tions of Gilbert Chance, an employe cf
the Western Meat Compary. All the par
ties are well known in San Mateo and
South San Francisco.
Howard speaks very unkindly of Mrs.
Howard's mother in his cross-complaint.
He says that despite his objections Mrs.
Howard insisted upon having her mother
â¢round. He says that when he, for the
sake of peace, ordered hÂ«r to leave their
house at 42 Stelner street she took a
room next door and then visited her
daughter from 7 a. m. to 9 p. m.
WAS NICE TO HEU.
Too much mother-in-law is alleged to
be the cause of the matrimonial difficul
ties of Grace L. and W. D. M. Howard.
This Is the condition set forth in thÂ© di
vorce' proceedings instituted by Mrs.
Howard some months ago and also in
the answer and cross-complaint filed by
Howard yesterday. The mother-in-law
figures in both Instances, Mrs. Howard
claiming that her husband, by treating
her mother in a brutal manner, caused
her great suffering. Howard, on thÂ© oth
er hand, claim e that he was compelled
to do as he did because of his mother-in
law's habit oiT forcing her presence
where she was n ot wanted.
There are othex charges made by Mrs.
Howard that arc denied by Howard, and
in his cross-complaint he makes a few al
legations tending to show that he is a.
much-abused individual. Howard, who Is
& mining engineer, denies that he was
ever cruel to his wife, or was ever guilty
of conduct unbecoming a gentleman. He
cays he never abused Mrs. Howard or
her mother in public or in private or ever
caused cither of thttm a minute's suffer
ing; In fact, he denies that he is other
than a loving, dutiful husband.
He alleges that Mrs. Howard has been
the cause of their unhappiness. He
charges her with being intemperate; that
ehe once assaulted him with a rifle and
that on another occasion she struck him
Â¦with an umbrella. She also struck him
with a hand mirror, he says, and often
kicked and scratched him.
The cloak manufacturers and ladiea'
tailors of San Francisco have taken* the
initial step toward making a great combi
nation that may eventually take in all
the cloak manufacturers and ladies'
tailors on the Pacific Coast. Much secrecy
has attended the proceedings. The work
of bringing the movement to the point it
has reached has been done by A. L>
Friedman. He refuses to give any infor
mation and the facts of the proposed com
bine were gathered among the cloak man
ufacturers and others.
The name of the combine will ba thÂ©
Cloak Manufacturers' and Ladles' Tallcrs'
Protective Association of California. It
was thought best to first confine- th* or
ganization to thia State and to widen its
scope later. All the cloak manufacturers
and many ladles' tailors of this city are
reported as members and the next step
will be to get thÂ© two lines of business in
Los Angeles. Sacramento and other cities
enlisted. The association wlli bÂ« incor
porated. Among the larger cloak manu
facturers who have Joined thÂ© combinÂ©
are Slminoff, M. Welnstein & Co., H. Rat
ner Cloak Manufacturing Company. D.
M. Davidson & Co. and thÂ© Kragen-Bam
berger Company.
A part of the board cf directors has
been selected. Those already named arÂ»
M. Weinsteln, G. Loewenthal, A. Goodman,.
S. Kramer, A. Cailleau and E. Messager.
The purposes of the combine, as they are
semi-offlcially described by onÂ© of thÂ«
members, are "to provide uniform busi
ness methods if possible; to counteract
Impositions upon the tradÂ© and to make
a mutual protective association to thÂ«
fullest extent." The officers have not
been selected. They will be named as
soon as the board of -directors Is complet
ed. A. L. Friedman is acting as thÂ© sec
retary.

The Board of Supervisors finally passed
yesterday a number of ordinances de
signed to put Into effect the provisions of
the new sanitary code recently adopted
by the Health Board. The ordinances
provide regulations for the maintenance
of public laundries, for the plumbing and
drainage of buildings, for the use of re
ceptacles for beverages, for the main
tenance of stables, for the labeling of
packages containing substances for hu
man consumption and for prohibiting the
pollution of water wells.
Two ordinances regulating the establish
ment, maintenance and inspection of
homes for children, maternity hospitals
and lying-in asylums were passed tn
print. The ordinances place the super
vision of such institutions in the hands of
the Board of Health.
A number of ordinances were finally
passed repealing all orders which were
supplemented by new laws to comply
with the charter. "Wilson objected to the
repeal of any old ordinance unless a new
one was enacted as a substitute. Bran
denstein explained that the Judiciary
Committee had recommended thÂ© repeal
of certain orders that were clearly un
constitutional and that others were re
vised in accordance with the charter pro
visions.
About 4 o'clock Bruder reached the sa
loon at 1126 Dupont street. Demeny and
his. sister, Maggie Demeny, who was di
vorced from Peterson about three weeks
ago, were in the saloon and Demeny asked
him to treat. He put 25 cents on the bar
and they had a drink. Demeny asked him
whether he and his sister or Peterson had
treated him best, and he replied that they
had all been good to him. Demeny called
him an offensive name and- struck him.
Demeny's sister tried to pacify him, but
he made for Bruder again, and Bruder
pulled the revolver out of his pocket and
fired two shots. He claimed that he had
no intention of shooting Demeny.
It was known that there had been bad
feeling between Peterson and Demeny for
some time prior to Peterson's divorce
from his wife, and this fact, together with
the fact that the shooting was done with
Peterson's revolver, gave rise to the sus
pision that Pe'terson might have instigat
ed the shooting, which led to his detention
In the prison.
Bruder was arrested by Policeman Sil
ver and Corporal Fraher. John Peterson,
proprietor of a restaurant at Pine street
and Belden place, was subsequently ar
rested by the same officers.' After Detec
tive T. B. Gibson and Corporal Fraher
had made an investigation and report to
Captain Martin Peterson was released
from custody. ;
According to Bruder's admission hÂ© was
drinking heavily on Sunday night, and
after quitting work at Peterson's restau
rant, where he was employed, he visited
different saloons on Dupont street. About
2 o'clock yesterday morning he returned
to the restaurant and going behind the
counter took Â¦ Peterson's revolver, which
he put in his pocket.
As a result of a drunken row in Pun*
nella & Tardita's saloon, at 1126 Dupont
street, about 4 o'efflck yesterday morning,
George Demeny, a laborer living at 635
Vallejo street, is at the Central Emer
gency Hospital with t a bullet in his abdo
men and J. H. Bruder, a waiter. Is in the
City Prison on a charge of assault to
murder.
E. P. E. Troy filed a protest with the
Supervisors against granting the Geary
street Railway Company a temporary
franchise. It was referred to the Public
Utilities Committee.
The petition of the merchants in the
vicinity of Market. Fourth, Ellis and
Stockton streets that they be permitted
to erect, at their own expense, for presen
tation to the city a concrete transfer
safety station at the Intersection of the
streets named was referred to the Street
Committee.
F. S. Shadburne, president of the St.
Mary's Square Association, argued that the
city should pay the judgments as a mat
ter of honor and equity. Chairman Bran
denstein contended that the fact that the
proposition to issue bonds for the square
had been defeated at the recent election
had demonstrated that the people did not
favor the improvement. F. J. Castlehun,
representing Colmann, said that It wquld
be unfair to abandon the proceedings, as
his client had been put to a great ex
pense, since he could not sell his property
while the condemnation proceedings were
pending.
Shadburne said there was $57,000 in the
St. Mary's Square fund which was sacred
and could not be used for any other pur
pose.
"If yon pay these Judgments," said
Shadburne, "we will promise to raise the
remainder of the money to purchase the
rest of the land necessary for the square."
The demands for paying the Judgments
were immediately drawn on the city
treasury.
The petition of the Southern Heights
Improvement Club that a flre engine Â«and
hose company be established a"t the cor
ner of Connecticut and Twentieth streets
was referred to the Finance Committee.
The Fire Commission asks that the sta
tion be established and that an appropri
ation be made for paying the salaries of
additional firemen required for the new
station, as the present appropriation is
barely adequate for the maintenance of
the department as now constituted.
Chief Engineer Sullivan suggests that
property owners be urged to secure such
changes in the grades of Twentieth street,
from Wisconsin to Vermont, as would en
able an engine to reach the latter point
without making a detour of a mile, and
likewise on Mississippi street, from Twen
tieth to Twenty-Second.
The \ Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted the recommendation of the Su
pervisors' Joint Committee on Finance
and Judiciary, favoring the payment
of two judgments obtained in the Superior
Court in the matter of condemnation pro
ceedings for St. Mary's square. The
judgments are in favor of Martin Col
mann for $9504 and Joseph Musto, $11,502, >a
total of $21,006. "

Dr. and Mrs. Joseph W. Henry have

To-morrow at 3 o'clock in St. Mary's
Cathedral Dr. Francis F. Knorp and Miss
Elsie L. Moraghan will plight their troth.

Charles A. Moraghan, and will be at
tended by her sister, Miss Eugenie. Mor
aghan, as maid of honor. George Knorp,

best man.
A charming affair was given by the
O. D. Baldwins on Saturday afternoon,
when they entertained about 150 friends
at an informal "at home" in their beau
tiful new dwelling place. The flowers
that graced the drawing-rooms were of
the rich autumnal yellows, reds and
browns, while the hall became a wood
land bower of huckleberry. Somewhere
from its dark recesses sweet music came
and softly tilled the air.

: Much interest has been manifested in
the announcement of an engagement be
tween the dashing Mrs. Louise Cather
wood Montagne, daughter of Mrs. John
A. Darling, and C. E. Maud, the young
Englishman who plays golf so cleverly.
Mrs. Montagne in 1892 wedded Dr. Ern
est Mo'ntagne and went with him to New
York City. There they maintained a fine
establishment at 114 East Thirtieth street
and entertained considerably, but some
how there came a rift in the lute of do
mestic bliss and a separation followed
last spring. . â¢
Mrs. Montasne then came on a visit to
her mother at her beautiful country seat
at Rutherford, In Napa County, making
short visits to Monterey during the sum
mer. It was there that the attachment
between the belle of the house of Hast
ings and the handsome golf player sprung
up. Tha date of the nuptials has not
been given out. Perhaps it has not been
settled upon. â¢Â»
The young soldier will not take his
bride immediately to the post at Chey

in California. They will, after a short
trip, return to San Francisco to remain
until the expiration of the officer's leave.
Miss Anna Sperry will assist the bride
as maid of honor, while Dr. Harold
Greenleaf, U. S. A., will officiate for the
groom. Harry C. Rodgers, J. Brockway
Metcalf, Lieutenant Edward Shinkle, U.
