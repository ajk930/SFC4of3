CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 15.â Secretary
of the Treasury Shaw has definitely de
cided to withdraw the Government! de
posits from all banks reducing their cir
culation to take advantage of the high
price of United States bonds where such
banks are already designated as United
States depositories. Furthermore, he will
refuse to grant .applications from . new
banks desiring to become Government de
positories unless they agree to maintain
their circulation at the present figures.
This, the Secretary hopes, will put an
end to the perplexing situation brought
about by the clamor of many banks for
increased- deposits, while at the same
time they are doing their. best to reduce
the volume of currency available for; busi
ness by retiring circulating notes based
on United States bonds.
While the treasury 'officials, as well as
oflicers of : national banks,, believe that
such "an anomalous situation/ is due more
to the .'system than to the action of the
banks, themselves, -Secretary Shaw be
lieves It is tlmato put an end to it, if
possible, and will make use of his discre
tionary . power in _namlng depositories to
show his : disapproval of retiring circula
tion for the purposes of bond speculation.
: Although no official ~ announcements
iiave been or will? be made on this inten
tion of Secretary Shaw, it can be said on
the highest authority that the action will
hÂ«' taken/- :.;'Â¦ ,

The doctors, then decided to give the
child an electrical spray bath. This was
done with a static machine, and when it
was completed the youngster was to all
intents as healthy as any other child less
than two hours old. Since then it has
continued to thrive.
ESSEX, Ont., Sept. 15.â Drs. James Brlen
and W. C. Doyle, physicians in this town,
were called last week to attend Mrs.
Frank Wagner. A child was born to her
of unusual size and giving no signs of life.
The physicians worked more than an hour
in a vain attempt to bring to life tho
child with hot and cold water baths, in
flating the lungs with a tube, artificial
respiration and every other means known,
and they finally decided to use electricity.
The house where the baby wjfe born is
three blocks from the physicians' office.
The doctors wrapped the child in a blank
et and carried it to the ofHce, where no
time waa lost in alternately applying a
Faradic current and a galvanic current
The negative pole was placed at the base
of the brain and the positive pole to the
abdomen. The physicians administered a
current of 120 milliamperes to the body.
Fifteen minutes after they had com
menced the treatment the child gave a
short gasp. This encouraged the physi
cians, who Increased the power of the
electrical current to 200' milliamperes, the
positive pole being changed to the base
of the brain and the negative pole to the
abdomen. Every moment the little one
showed increasing signs of life, and
within, ten minutes it was breathing nat
urally.

"I think the public is so deeply inter
ested in Sir Thomas and his welfare that
all there is to know should be given out."
said Alexander H. Revell. "It is true that
there are serious Indications of inflam
mation, and we are all pretty much wor
ried. Everything Is being- done, and an
other consultation will be held in the
morning. In the meantime Drs. Thomas
and Webster and myself will be in con
stant attendance on Sir Thomas."-
During the day Dr. Homer M. Thomas
had been In attendance on the distin
guished patient. In the evening the Baro
net's condition became suddenly worse,
and it was decided to call eminent spe
cialists into consultation.
For more than an hour Drs. Senn, Web
ster and Thomas were engaged In their
examination, concluding with a diagnosis
that unmistakable symptoms of inflam
mation of the stomach and bowels were
in evidence. Up to that time his ailment
had been diagnosed as acute Indigestion.
When the physicians emerged from the
sick room they declined to discuss Sir
Thomas' condition further than to make
the briefest statement. Neither would
they say whether they thought his chance
lor recovery was good.
CHICAGO, Sept. 15.â Sir Thomas Llpton
arrived in Chicago to-day too 111 to meet
any of the engagements arranged for him,
and was pronounced late to-night to be
suffering from inflammation of the stom

SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 15.â In the tangled
kelp that brushes the shingle below the
trown bluffs on the ocean drive, or per
haps fathoms deep In the cold embrace
of the "mother and lover of menâ the
sea," the body of Miss Hertha Page of
San Jose is believed to rest to-night.
The young society belle's black velvet
jacket, her hat and her tan gloves were
found to-day in a coign of the cliffs not
very far from the point where the electric
railroad has Its terminus. She was seen
near the spot yesterday gazing wistfully
over the illimitable expanse of ocean, and
It is conjectured, with abundant reason,
That she destroyed her life by leaping
into the surf below.
Although she had been here for more
than a day and a night, Jt is not recorded
that she stayed at a hotel or lodging
house. She had not even been seen about
town, and it is probable that when she
left the train the wandered out on the
cliff drive nnd in <be midst of the fire of
flowers and glowing grass sorrowed over
the misery of her young life and nerved
herself to the desperate business of self
destruction.
FINDING OF A JACKET.
The ciothing was found shortly before
21 o'clock this morning by L. D. Rlther
ma:i of Denver. Sheriff Langford and M.
EL Page, the young woman's brother,
who had been in comunication with Chief
of Police Clark and Sheriff Trafton. had
inadÂ» a thorough search of the hotejs and
boardlr.g-houses, but without success.
They ascertained, however, that the wom
an had arrived on the narrow gauge train
Sunday evening at 8 o'clock.
Early this morning the brother arose
ft&d at 6 o'clock went to the Catholic
church and to other churches, as once
l><-fore in San Jose Mi.-s Page had been
found lying on the steps of a church.
Nothing was seen of her by the brother.
end he then went to Capitola to search
the coast line for four miles, while Sher
iff I^angford of San Jose and Sheriff
Trafton went up the coast to hunt be
tween Moorrs Beach, four miles from this
dry, and the beach here.
When the Sheriffs were near the mu
ffum on * h Â« cliffs Ritherman approached
with the woman's wearing npparel. He
tvas a visitor In the city. He had gone
to the end of the electric car line on a
Fiphtsc-cing tour and was walking along
the drive when he found a jacket lined
with pink silk. Upon it were a couple
f)f dahlias. He al?o picked up the tan
Kloves and the v.Hte hat edged with
white lace and trimmed with blue forget
me-nots. This is e hat which was worn
by the young lady when she left San
Jose end which was Immediately recog
nized as hers by Sheriff Laneford.
BOCK OF A CHUECH.
The place where the articles were found
is within a few hundred feet of the end
of the electric car line, near Garfleld
Park and close to the cliff museum. They
were on a email shelf of earth Just above
a cliff that overlaps the surging waters
f)f the ocean. This particular cliff is
known as Christian Endeavor Rock and
on It is carved a large cross. The rock
was dedicated and named by the En
doavorers of the Christian church of Call
fornia, and yearly when their conven
tion Is held at Garfield Park a sunrise
prayer meetins Is held there.
Apparently It was from that rock that
the girl leaped to end her life. The wa
ter at that point Is the roughest along
the coast and there Is a perilous under
tow. The high waves come together In
three directions. The cliffs are honey
combed and the waves reach under the
:oad for a couple of hundred feet, mak
kig several natural arches. There is a
possibility that the body might wash up
i:: one of these caves. Near this point
is & monster bed of seaweed and kelp
and there is a strong possibility that the
human form Is entangled In the meshes
ui the sea. flora.
VIGIL AT THE SEA.
It is thought that Miss Page ended her
life early this morning. Yesterday after :
i:oon Mrs. J. A. Moore, wife of the pro
prietor of the cliff museum, saw the lady
lcr three hours at the point where the
v. < aring apparel was found. Mrs. Moore
did not think It strange, as from this
!>!ace one of the finest views along the
coast can be obtained of the waves as
they dash their spray against the cliff,
and It Is no unusual thing for people to
remain and watch by the hour. Mrs.
Moore says she saw the young woman

however, it is declared that the only step

If it has not been deliberately fostered, cer

notion that Mr. Low Is approved by the Presi
dent and that the President's influence Is be
hind him. and each day this Idea Is hurting
a man loved by many who are opposed to him
politically and in a State where, in his own
time of trial, he will desperately need every
friendly influence he can have. I do not mean
that the President, as an individual, disap
proves of Mr. Low or his candidacy. I have
no authority or information to speak on such
a subject, but I have excellent reasons to be
lieve that the President, with perfect appre
ciation of the dignity of his position, has ab
stained wholly from any expression of approval,
even to Mr. Low himself.
The weakness of. Mr. Low as a mayoral
ty candidate Jerome attributes to "ego
tism, self-complacency and limitations."
Low's recent letter accepting the indorse
ment of the fusionlst conference. Jercme
says, "is destitute of every Indication of
leadership." As for the attitude of Pres
ident Koosevelt toward the municipal
campaign, Jerome says:
I have potlsflcd myself by careful inquiry
thBt the irrent mass of people to whom we must
look for support In the coming campalta be
lieve that Mr. Low cannot be re-elected, and
that while they may give a half-hearted sup
port to him for the Fake of the cause they
cannot overcome their dislike and disgust for
him.
The voting during the <"ay was remark
ably free from trouble. There were no
more than fifty arrests during the entire
seven hours of voting. All of thesa cases
were attended to by the city magistrates
and a great majority of them proved to
be errors on the part of the complainants
and the men were discharged.

ABANDONS CHAMBERLAIN.
Were I proved to be wrong, my opinion on
thÂ« fundamental question would remain un
changed. Where we fail, others may succeed.
It cannot be right for a country with free
trade Jdeals to enter Into competition wltn
protectionist rivals, self deprived of the only
Instrument whereby their policy can conceiv
ably be modified. The rnont essential object
of our national efforts should be to get rid of
the bonds in which we have gratuitously en
tangled ouraelves. The precise manner In
which we should use our repalned liberty la
Important, yet. after all. only a secondary
lisue.
Balfour declares that the optimists who
advocate a continuance of the free trade
policy in spite of the injury worked by
protection on Great Britain's Interests
are foolish and their arguments little
short of reckless. The only possible hope
of a mitigation of the evil is through
negotiation, which, he says, can only ap
peal to self-interest In foreign protected
countries, and In the case of the colonies
to self-interest coupled with sentiment.
Balfour concludes:
Balfour says the mistakes made by the
free traders half a century ago have left
Great Britain bearing all the burdens and
enjoying only half the advantages which
should attach to the empire. He devotes
much space to the effect of protection
upon combinations In countries in which
protection exists. This, the Premier
points out. is to the disadvantage of the
British manufacturer, who is , unable to
compete with, the manufacturer who is
able to sell abroad at a lower price than
he charges for the same article at home.
He gives an Instance of German steel in
this particular, saying that* it" is selling
cheaper in England - thaji the 'â¢ English
manufacturer can possibly produce it for.
JOYS OF FREE TRADE.
The arguments presented throughout the
pamphlet vary little from those already
enunciated, but the Premier points out
that as a result of England's retaining a
fiscal policy made for a free trade coun
try in a world of free traders, not for a
free trade country in a world of pro
tectionists, the rate of her export trade
has not increased and in fact has seri
ously diminished. Â¦
Compared with past years some depart
ments show no increase, while others
show symptoms of decay. ,The Premier
asserts that there is no reason to expect
an improvement. Meanwhile Germany,
America, France, Russia and even Great
Britain's self-governing colonies continue
to build up a protected interest within
their borders.
Balfour says he approaches the subject
from the standpoint of a free trader aa
far as contemporary circumstances will
permit. He continues: i
I am a free trader, but not of the pattern
which holds that the doctrine of free trade Is
so universal In its application and Is capable
of such exact expresston that every conclusion
to which It logically leads must be accepted
without hesitation and without reserve.
LONDON. Sept. 16.â Premier Balfour
Issued last night the advance sheets of
a pamphlet on the subject "Insular Free
Trade," in which he presents at length
arguments in favor of a change in Great
Britain's fiscal policy. In introducing the
pamphlet Balfour says his purpose In is
suing it is that It would be impossible to
put all the Important points of this ques
tion within the limits of a single apeech;
therefore the pamphlet may be a fitting
preliminary to the. speech which he will
shortly make. This undoubtedly refers
to the speech Balfour will make at Shef

perhaps that of the Duke of Devonshire,
will be announced, although nothing cer
tain is known, and the Standard, a Con
servative organ, contends in its editorial
article that this is no occasion whatever,
under the existing understanding, for any
member of the Cabinet to withdraw.

HONOLULU, Sept. 15.-United States
District Attorney Breckona has com
menced an investigation of the disbar
ment of Attorney George A. Davis, who,
with Circuit Judge Humphreys, was ac
cused and found guilty of unprofessional
conduct in the case of John Sumner. who,
it was alleged, was mulcted out of J30.000 j
in fees in a few short months. Breckons
recently commenced proceedings for a re
hearing and pending a review of the evi
dence against him by the Supreme Court
he was restored to hla rights and permit
ted to resume his legal practice in these
islands. District Attorney Breckons has
now become Interested In the case and
will make a thorough canvass of the en

disbarment.
It is reported on good authority that
the action of the United States District
Attorney is Inspired by Attorney General.

In short, the great question of free trade
versus protection, so far as the Cabinet
Is concerned. Is still undecided. What will
be Colonial Secretary Chamberlain's atti
tude is the burning question of the mo
ment. The most striking feature of Bal
four's pamphlet is that from the begin
ning to the end it does not refer to Cham
berlain's proposal. There is not a word
about the threatened breaking up of the
empire or preferential tariffs, and the
colonies are scarcely mentioned. On the
contrary, the whole line of Balfour's rea
soning is opposed to tariffs for purely pro
tective purposes. . Hence Chamberlain is
faced by the alternative of either aban
doning preferential tariffs or prosecuting
his campaign unsupported by Balfour.

It was e o'clock when Bhe left home
and Bhe had but little time to reach the
depot and catch the train at 6:25 to San
ta Cruz. s She rode a block or two in the
direction she said she was going and then
evidently .turned and went straight to
the depot. She left her bicycle at a
warehouse near there.
It is believed she realized the step she
was taking. Trainmen were attracted to
the young lady as she appeared distress
ed and at times was In tears and sobs.
On the day of her disappearance mem
bers of the Oratorio Society, of which she
was assistant secretary, received postals
from .her announcing the renewal ot
meetings of that society and the tak
ing up of "The Bohemian Girl." Miss
Page had written these postals the day
before her disappearance. -
Sheriff Langford returned this evening
from Santa Cruz. MiltÂ»n Page, a brother
of the missing girl, will remain there to
continue the search along the beach.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 15.-There Is no doubt
now that Hertha Page, the pretty so
ciety girl who so mysteriously dU-ppear
ed frt her home here Sunday evening,
has committed suicide. The finding of
her body is believed to be but a ques
tion of hours or days. Her hat. jacket
and gloves, found on the rocks on the
cliff drive at Santa Cruz, have dispelled
all hope of her being alive and her fam
ily is convinced she is dead.
Insanity caused by sickness and ner
vous prostration lured her rrom the com
forts of an elegant home. Friends of
the gill are now sure that she had been
suffering for weeks. Everything now
points to a deliberate attempt at suicide.
When Miss Page rode from home she
evidently intended going to Santa Cruz
to end her life. She took what money
she had with her. The announcement that
she Intended to call on friends, is be
lieved to have been for the purpose of
not arousing her family's suspicious.
Friends of Miss Page Believe That
She Committed Suicide.
SORROW IN SAN JOSE.
â¢ The brother, on his return from Capi
tola. Identified the clothing. The entire
afternoon has been spent by young Page,
Sheriff Langford, Sheriff Trafton and
William Barnes of San Jose in patrolling
the coast and keeping a lookout.
Up to a late hour this evening the body
of Miss Page had not been found. Al
though there Is a slight hope that she
wandered away after leaving her wear-
Ing apparel on the rocks, all Indications
point to self-destruction. It is known
that she had expressed a wish for death.
The body may come ashore any hour or
may take days. A watch will be kept all
night
near the museum. She was holding the
rail and swincine.
This morning shortly after 6 o'clock the
daughters of Mrs. Moore walked along
the edjre of the bluff above and there
were no clothes there, so It must have
been after this hour that she again vis
ited the spot where she spent the several
hours yesterday.
STEAMER LOST
IN FLORIDA GALE
The meeting of the commission to-day
ended shortly after 4 o'clock. Attorney
General Finlay to-morrow will resume the
presentation of the Canadian case.
Lord Alverstone's ruling: was regarded
by American counsel as being a point in
favor of the United States.
The Attorney General went on at such
length that Lord Alverstone reminded him
that the tribunal was familiar with the
documents In the case, and suggested that
he simply cite the pages and volumes in
which his references were found.*
Attorney General Finlay remarked that
this was a "subtle'dlstlnction," and Chief
Justice Alverstone ended the discussion
with saying that it made little difference,
as It was "merely the direction of the
surveyors. ,
While Attorney General Finlay was
speaking Chief Justice Fuller, accompa
nied by Embassador Choate, entered the
chamber. They were conducted to a table
directly facing the Commissioners. The
Attorney General briefly described the
historical aspect of the question and took
up the treaty under which the commis
sion was appointed. He then presented
the Canadian contention, each point of
which has already been stated In the
argument of Clifford Sifton, the Canadian
Minister of the Interior, and urged the
Commissioners to confine themselves
strictly In considering the questions to
the terms of the controversy between
Great Britain and Russia of 1S23, and not
to depart therefrom.
The interest of the Commissioners grew
as Attorney General Finlay proceeded
with his analytic study of the question.
Speaking of the location of the. line along
the coast from the head of Portland
channel, a3 fixed by the treaty, the At
torney General pointed out that the re
port of the United States coast survey In
1S93 showed that the Washington Govern
ment had adopted the view that the line
should follow the "general trend of the
coast." which supports the Canadian con
tention.
Senator Turner at this point interrupted
the speaker, saying that the report re
ferred to the "trend of the general coast."
LONDON, Â§ept. 15'.â "When the Alas
kan Boundary Commission ad
journed this afternoon the Cana
dians were gratified at securing
Â¦what they believed to be the first
good point. During the afternoon session
the Attorney General sought to establish
the position of Portland channel and fix
the entrance thereto. He Interpreted the
words "a la hauteur des" In the Russo-
Brltlsh correspondence leading to the sig
nature of the treaty of 1S25 not as show
ing that the boundary lies "on the same
parallel" and the lower end of the Prince
of Wales lsland < as claimed by the United
States, but "off of." as asserted by Can
ada. The effect of this would be to fix
the line at 54 degrees 45 minutes, as
claimed by Canada. Chief Justice Alver
stone agreed wiht Attorney General Fin
lay.
When American counsel have the oppor
tunity to speak they say they will show
that the Canadians themselves have given
various Interpretations of the phrase, and
they are Inclined to minimize' the Im
portance of Lord Alverstone's statement.
The commission reassembled at the For
eign Office to-day and the oral arguments
began. Additional interest was lent to th-3
proceedings by the statements attributed
to some of the Canadians that their coun
try would seriously resent an adverse de
cision. " Nevertheless only a few specta
tors, Including the wives of the. Commis
sioners and of counsel, were present when
Attorney General Finlay rose and com
menced the presentation of the Canadian
argument.

APPAREL NOTES
Men's Business Dress
CL It seems after all that the single-breasted sack suit
is the favorite style for general business wear among
men who are noted for good taste in dress.
<L Next in favor is the three-buttoned double-
breasted sack, with narrow, curved collar and long,
well-shaped lapels, with the buttons so spaced as to
give a very broad-chest effect to the wearer.
C Either a soft hat pr a Derby, .in black or the
popular shades, is the proper hat to wear with a sack
suit. The shirt may be a soft or stiff bosom, in
fancy colored pattern.
tt The proper scarf is either a two-inch four-in-hand
or an English square. A white or fancy waistcoat is
always in good taste with black or dark coat and
trousers. .

To-night the most elaborate social fea

for the representatives was given in the
Kiesel building, consisting of a reception
and ball given by President Clark and
the citizens of Ogden.
Senator Burton Introduced tho-following
resolution, which was received with con
siderable enthusiasm:
Resolved, That it la the sense of this con
gress that the storage of water in the extensive
catchment of the streams for the prevention of
floods, as well as for power and irrigation, is
both possible and practicable, and that the
Govermcnt can accomplish as much, or more,
toward the preservation of life and property in
the lower reaches of the stream by directing Ita
efforts In this way toward the prevention of
floods than it can by its present method In try
ing to control them by the levee system, and
the waters thus conserved would be of inesti
mable value, a blessing to the people In the
arid and aeml-arid district. We believe that
irrigation and flood prevention are twin ideas
to be developed together.

first formal address of the congress. His
subject was "Irrigation and the Conser

Floods." Senator Burton made a strong
plea for the control of the floodwater at

HONOLULU, Sept. 6.â United States
District Attorney Breckons is making an
investigation Into the local Japanese gang
of procurers and has discovered startling
facts In connection with the importation
of women from Japan for Immoral pur
poses. The Japanese have the business
on an organized protective basis. Several
of them have been arrested and are held
to await the Federal Grand Jury.
In a raid last night Vnited States Mar
shal Hendry and others were attacked
by a crowd of Japanese and some of them
threw a brick, which narrowly missed the
Marshal's head. The officers were after
one Wada, alleged to be a member of the
association, and succeeded in arresting
him. It Is said that the evidence in court
will Include contracts for the sale and
purchase of -women, use of husband's
names to pass the immigration officials
and the book records of the protective
association of Japanese.

NEW YORK, Sept. 15.â In the best-in
formed circles it is accepted as settled
that at the atinual meeting of the stock
holders of the New York. New Haven and
Hartford road in October President
Charles H. Mellen of the Northern Pacific
will be elected to succeed President Hall,
whose resignation is expected thia week.
There Is much surmise as to the ..suc
cessor of Mellen on the Northern Pacific,
should he change his official relations. In
the natural line of promotion is the vice
president and general manager, J. M.
Hannnford, who has been with the North
ern Pacific road for about thirty years.
Daniel S. Lamont, who is first vice presi
dent of the cempany, is likely to remain
in that Dosition.
The Migeestion is made that F. D. Un
derwood, r-iesldcnt of the Erie Railroad,
will be offered the Northern Pacific presi
dency, but in well-informed circles it is
thought that Charles W. Bunn, general
counsel of the Northern Pacific, will be
the successor of Mellen.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Several Minor Changes Made Among
There is nothing In the constitution of thiÂ«
State which upholds the proceedings of the
military since they have come into the dis
trict Under the constitution the military of
this State is given a very limited scope. Even
now General Bell is amenableto the civil law
for his actions.
Th<* Pennsylvania decision, which evidently
guides General Chase tn makinc arrests of
union men, may he good law in Pennsylvania,
but when it conflicts with the constitution of
this State, as it certainly does, it can have no
effect here.
County Commissioner Patrick J. Lynch
and Justice of the Peace W. P. Reilly,
who were arrested by the military last
night and subsequently released, an
nounced their determination to bring civil
suits for $100,000 damages for false im
prisonment against Governor Peabody,
Cenerals Bell and Chase and others con
nected with their arrest, Â¦whom they will
charge with conspiracy. Lynch and Rell
ly were charged with having criticised
acts of the militia and counsele\mlners
not to return. Former Attorney General
Eugene Engley, counsel for four union
leaders who are held prisoners in the mil
itary guard house, and Attorney General
J. H. Murphy of the Western Federation
of Miners consulted together to-day with
reference to protection -of the union men
from alleged aggressions of the military.
After the conference Murphy said;
A meeting of county officials was held
to-day for the. purpose of trying to de
vise means for ascertaining just how far
the military authorities can go in the ar
rest of citizens without warrant -of -law.
There were present Sheriff Robertson,
Deputy District Attorney Cole, Chairman
of the Board of County Commissioners
Lynch, County Commissioner Pfeiffer and
ex-County Attorney Hangs. At the con
clusion of the meeting It was announced
that no action so far had been decided
upon.
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., Sept. 15.â A
Consignment of 1000 Krag-Jorgenson rifles
from the United States Government ar
rived in camp to-day and they were im
mediately distributed among the troops
on duty here. Besides the new rifles 60,
000 rounds of ammunition were als.o re
ceived. This is the first new equipment
to be sent to Colorado under the Dick
bill, '
HAVANA, Seat. 15.â The captain of the
steamer Vicllancia, which has arrived
here, reports that many wrecks were
sighted on the Florida coast, one of them
being ten miles north of Jupiter, where
a schooner was wrecked. Her crew Is
ashore. Farther south a Standard Oil
barge was stranded and thlrtv miles
south a Spanish steamer from Balbao was
broken In two. Still farther south a
schooner was stranded.
JACKSONVILLE. Fla., Sept. 15.â
Further news of the storm continues to
arrive, though a large part of the storm
swept area has not yet been heard from.
Wires are still down and it is impossible
to pet trains through on account of wash
outs.
/Three negroes were killed by falling
timbers at'the camp of the Cummer Lum
ber Company near Gainesville. Another
was probably fatally hurt. Several
houses were wrecked.
At Mulberry the phosphate mines are
said to be sreatly damaged. They have
been compelled to shut down on account
of the high water. From all parts of the
State great damage to the turpentine In
dustry is reported.
Wire connection was made to-night with
Arcadia, in Desoto County, about forty
miles south of Tampa. A special from
there says the damage to orange groves
is very great. Orange men estimate the
loss to the crop from 25 to 40 ptr cent.
Many houses were blown down, but only
one man was killed. \_
CHICAGO. Sept. 15.â Mrs. Rosie Lamen
strof. the California woman who .trav
eled half way across the continent In the
endeavor to regain the children who were
lost to her, to-day lost again her eldest
son, Charley, whom she had kidnaped
from school yesterday. The entire neigh
borhood knew the boy had been kidnaped
by his mother and was working In the
endeavor to find him.
Not satisfied with getting back but one
of the children, when there were two that
in her California home she had rocked In
her arms, the mother returned to the
neighborhood for the other child. She
went to the Anderson school at Lincoln
and Division streets to-day, just around
the corner from the present home of her
former husband, Joseph Lamenstrof, and
waited for the school children to pass.
With her was her son Charley, whom the
day before she had led away with prom
ises of candy and new clothes.
Tho boys and girls of the neighborhood,
seeing Charley Lamenstrof with the
woman they had seen walk away with
him the previous day carried the news
to Mrs. Lamenstrof No. 2, who hastened
to the corner near the school and catch
ing Master Charley by the hand dragged
him away amid the cheers of the school
and before the mother realized what had
happened.
Now the two children are safely lodged
in their home and will not be allowed to
venture on the street until after tho
mother has returned to California.

tion is already under way. Up to this
afternoon El Paso, Texas, apparently had
almost a walkover, but late in the day
the Idaho delegation, one of the largest
of the congress, unanimously resolved to
support and fight for Boise for the honor.
Rrno, Nevada, is also making a brisk
flg-ht, while Portland has many friends.
No opposition to the present officers of
the congress has developed, and the sen
timent seems to be unanimous for the re
election of President W. A. Clark and tLe
other officers.
President Clark this afternoon caused
considerable joy by declaring his inten
tion of limiting the speeches to ten min
utes, if possible.
Among the speakers will be United
States Senators and Governors of a half
dozen States of the West. Government
experts in forestry and irrigation and rep
resentatives of many Western commercial
organizations and colonization move
ments.
Delegates continue to pour into the city,
every train arriving this morning bring
in? in hundreds Interested in the work of
the congress.
DELEGATES ARE WELCOMED.
Although the first meeting was sched
uled for 9:30 a. m., it was considerably be
yond that time when President W. A.
Clark ascended the platform of the Tab
ernacle, In which the meetings are to be
held, and rapped for order. After Invo
cation Governor Wells of Utah warmly
welcomed the delegates In behalf of the
pioneer irrigation State. A welcome to
Ogden was then extended by Mayor Wil
liam Glasmann.
President Clark then responded In be
half of the National Irrigation Congress.
He said In part:
No act of the Xational Congress since that
providing for the construction of the great
Pacific railroads has meant so much for the
great West as the one providing for the rt-cla
mstlon cf the public lands."' It opens up a
new era of nrosperlty in sixteen States and
Ti-rrltorie?. It provides the means for over
coming the aridity, the great obstacle that re
tarded the settlement of more than onÂ«-thlrd
of the area of the republic. It is estimated
that ihere remains in the arid and Â«emi-arld
zon<; about MXMiCO.OOO acres of vacant public
land and that there is sufficient water avail
able under the storage system to irrigate about
one-nixth of It. The area already occupied
and irrigated Is 6,500,000 acres. If in the next
thirty years the Government should provide
reservoirs sufficient to reclaim 20,000,000
acres at an expenditure of $10,000,000 annu
ally, which is a very conservative estimate, 'as
that amount will be easily realized from the
!-alÂ« of land, the laYid reclaimed will provide
homes for at least 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 of
people, which with the Immense property value
mcensarily created will constitute a magnifi
cent contribution to the wealth and glory of
tho nation.
Letters were read from President
Roosevelt and Secretary of the Interior
Hitchcock.
WILSON IS INTRODUCED.
Committees on credentials, permanent
organization and resolutions were pro
vided for, to consist of one member from
rach State and Territory represented, and
adjournment until 1:30 p. m. was taken.
Just previous to adjournment Secretary
of Agriculture Wilson was introduced,
amid much cheering.
It was 2:35 p. m. before the delegates
convened for the afternoon session. The
roll of Btates was called and the various
committeemen named. The rollcall de
veloped the fact that twenty-six States
and Territories were represented at the
congress, the largest number ever tak
ing part In the movement. The following
message from President Roosevelt, re
ceived this afternoon, was then read:
OTSTER BAY. N. Y.. Sept. 15.â The passage
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
United States Senator Burton of Kan
sas was then introduced and delivered the
The Irrigation development of the arid West
cannot stand alone. Forestry is the companion
and the support of irrigation. Without forestry
irrigation must fall. Permanent irrigation de
velopment and forest destruction cannot exist
together. Never forget that the forest reserve
policy of the national Government means the
use of all the resources of the forest reserves
There is little profit In destruction compared
with use. The settlement of the great arid
West by the makers of homes is the central
object both of the irrigation and the forest pol
icy of the United States. In forestry, as in ir
rigation, the immediate private Interests of
some individual must occasionally yield to their
permanent advantage, which Is the public good.
The benefits of forestry are not only for the fu
ture, but for the present. The forest reserve*
are for all the people, hut first for the people
In the immediate neighborhood for whom sup
plier of wood and water are among the first
necessities of life. With the wiser and j more
skillful management of the reserves by trained
men the greater obviously will their usefulnes*
be to the public. We must never allow our
chagrin at temporary defeat and difficulties in
the management of the forest reserves to blind
ys to the absolute necessity of these reserves to
the people of the West. Support of the forest
reserve policy has grown with wonderful rapid
ity In the West during the last few years It
will continue to grow until the last vestige of
opposition, now almost gone, has wholly disap
peared before their understanding of the object
and the effect of the forest reservation. The
greater the support of the forest reserve by
the people of the West the greater the assur
ance that the national irrigation policy will not
fall, for the preservation of the forests is vital
to the success of this policy.
FOREST RESERVE POLICY.
Vast though the benefits of the reclamation
law, there will be many disappointments, which
necessarily await both the advocate of special
projects and the men whose desire for accom
plished results outruns the slow and steady de
velopment of theEe great undertakings. It
should be borne In mind that a broad survey of
all possible projects gives the conception of
their relative value and that a work of prime
Importance to one group of men may seem less
desirable in the light of wider knowledge. Nor
is it wise in large affairs to begin construction
first and elaborate details afterward. Each Im
portant point must be carefully studied In ad
vance and the whole plan teeted and approved
before work can begin. Yet If we proceed both
cautiously and persistently under this benefi
cent law we may confidently expect the largest
possible development of our arid lands and their
settlement by Industrious, prosperous, self-re
specting men and women, who will exchange
the products of irrigated agriculture for the
products of mills and factories throughout the
United Btates. Communities flourishing in
what is now the desert wljl finally take their
places among the strongest pillars of our com
monwealth.
Great care and the highest engineering skill
are required to plan and build such works,
which are among the most difficult undertak
ings of mankind. They must be built for per
manence and safety, for they are to last and
spread prosperity, for centuries. To design
and build such work* a body of engineers of
thÂ« highest character have been brought to
gether In the reclamation service, for only
mtn Impartially selected for capacity alone are
capable of creating these gTeat structures.
Merit must govern, not only In the selection of
men. but still more in the selection of the pro
jects. Every reclamation project selected for
construction must possess the qualities which
commend It as a national undertaking, certain
to reclaim large tracts of arid land and to
support In well being a dense and vigorous
population.
TO LAST FOR CENTURIES.
is an accomplished fact it must be given effect.
To that end the reclamation service org^nlz^d
under the national Irrigation law of June 17,
1X92, has been pushing Its surveys and exam
ination of possible Irrigation projects ener
getically in each of the thirteen States and
three Territories named In the act. Some of the
projects which promised bo well at first are
found on careful study to be Impracticable;
eithÂ»r because of scanty water supply or of
great cost, others must await higher values
In land, while still others stand the test and
are ready for Immediate construction. The
feapible projects are always large and costly,
because private enterprise has already seized
upon the smaller and less expensive ones, leav
ing to the Government great workB which are
to be an essential rart In bringing the na
tion to Its full development.

An International aspect was lent to the
proceedings by the presence of two rep
resentatives of foreign governments-
Mexico and France â while the Govern
ment at V.'ashington was represented by
Secretary of Agriculture "V\'ilson.
At both the morning and afternoon ses
sions the building was packed with inter
acted delegates and the keynote of the
present congress as expressed both by
Governor Wells of Utah la his speech of
welcome and President W. A. Clark in
his response, that "the time has come to
do things," was heartily cheered.
BURTON EVOKES ENTHUSIASM.
Important results beneficial to the cause
of Irrigation are confidently anticipated
Tn- both delegates and officials from the
present congress and lhe> first resolution,
introduced by Senator Burton of Kansas,
favoring the conserving of the flood wa
ters cf the great rivers as a part of the
scheme of irrigation of the West, was re
reived with so much favor that there
teems to be no doubt that such action
will be overwhelmingly favored.
Other resolutions, outlining a distinct
plan of forest preservation, are expected
to be adopted beiore the sessions of the
congress close.
To-morrow the subject of "Coloniza
tion" will be taken up and discussed by
men prominent in railway and sociolog
ical work.

Tromben in the role of Amlna triumphed.
The little lady sang Bellini truly arid act

duet, "Prendi l'Nel," with Elvino, Trom
ben showed not alone vocal capacity, but
also intense' dramatic emotion.
And the youthful Alfredo Tedeschi,
with the figure of the boy and the aJr of
the shy studentâ what a kindly surprise
he, too, had in store, for it is true his
voice gave to the melodiesâ solo and duet
and in , the concerted numbersâ a pure,
fine clearness of tone that won for him
tremendous applause in each, of the three
acts.
Signor Augusto Dado looked the ma

John Joe Loses $4000 in Coin, Which
Disappears From Wagon Near
San Bruno Road.
John Joe, a member of the band of gyp
sies at present camping out near the San
Bruno road, reported to the Mission po
lice station last night that he had been
robbed of $4000, but could give the officers
no information that might lead to an ar
rest.
According to Joe's statement, he had
the money, which represented coin from
many countries, in several sacks and
stored away in a wagon. He went to get
it last night, and to his surprise found
that some one had made away with it.
He believes he . was followed by some
crook about town and that the latter sa.w
him deposit the sack and then awaited
his chance to steal it.
The police are of the opinion that Joe's
money was stolen by some one of the
other members of the band. Detectives
Coleman and Cody and Corporal Calla

Claims He Was Imposed Upon.
William Ryan, aged 63 years, is suing
his wife, Kate Ryan, to set aside a deed
to property on I street, near Twelfth
avenue, which he claims he made while
under the Impression that he was simply
making a declaration of homestead. In
his complaint, which was filed yesterday,
he claims that he was imposed upon by
a Mrs. Eugene Avey, who, he says, im*
portuned him to sign the document just
Vto , make Kate feel all right." He says
that he signed the deed in ; August, 1901.
and did not learn of the alleged deception
until a few dayg ago. He demanded that
the deed be destroyed, but his wife re
fused to do so.

POPULAR YOUNG ATTORNEY WHO WAS UNANIMOUSLY CHOSEN TO PRESIDE OVER THE REPUBLICAN
MUNICIPAL CONVENTION AND SOME IMPRESSIONS OF PROMINENT DELEGATES DRAWN BY ONE
OF THE CARTOONISTS OF THE CALL'S STAFF.
SACRAMENTO. Fopt. 15.â For the sec
ond time ia the rece'nt past a member
of the National Ouard of California has
been denied the prlvilepe of belonging to
i!k Painters" and Decorators' Union of
Bacnunento because of his connection
with the State militia. The present in
i idem has created Quite a stir in mili
tary circles in Sacramento and Kl Dorado
ro unite*.
Waldo Walling, a young painter, a mem
ber of Company H. N. G. C, of Plaoer
.illo, came lo Sacramento the other day
to go to work at his trade. I'pon mak
ing application to the local union for
membership he was informed that he
mu^t sever his connection with the Na
tional Guard, as do member of the union
<-ould be permitted to belong to the State
soldiery. Walling lias secured his release
from the National Guard on tbe ground
of removal from Placerville. and so will
be taken into the union without further
objection.
In a statement J. A. Xicholaus. prÂ«si
Â«1ert of the local Painters'. Decorators"
and Pa pÂ«.r hungers' Union, declares that j
the provision in the constitution against!
a member of the union belonging to the ;
National Guard was adopted by the na
tional body in convention, and that the
local unions have no alternative in the
matter. He said the local unions could
make their own by-laws, but could not j
override the constitution, which says that
no mf-mber of the union shall be connect
â¢ '1 with the constabulary or militia or in
way serve as aa officer of the law. He
said he know of no other union that has j
this provision in its constitution.
i^cial Dispatch to The Cail
For forty-two years, with but a single excep
tion, the destinies of this country have â¢ been
committed to the care and keeping of the Re
publican party. The exception I should not
nÂ«-ed to refer to. if it were not so recent and
eo dieaKtrouK to many of us. I refer to the
time when there were nouphouses In New York
and a dollar a day Dewey boulevard conditions
In the city of San Francisco. I'nder the guid
ance and wisdom of the Republican party the
wage worker of this country la better housed,
better clothed, better fed, better, educated and
Chairman Riordan recognized ex-Sena
tor A. P. "Williams, one of the leaders of
the United Republican League. He paid
Senator Williams eome high compliments
for the excellent work he had done in
the past and told of his earnest efforts
to brfns about a united party In San
Francisco. He invited Senator Williams
to the platform, and when that distin
guished Republican took his place along
side Mr. Riordan the delegates heartily
applauded him. When the outburst had
subsided Senator Williams addressed the
delegates as follows:
Mr. Chairman of the Republican County
Committee of San Francisco, members of the
Municipal Convention and centlemen: I
thank you for your cordial reception. I am
not egotistical enough to Â»uppoi=e that It is
intended for me. but rather as a compliment
to the ITnitod Republican League of Pan Fran-"
Cisco (applause)- and as tuch I will receive it.
The Republican League of San Francisco,
which haÂ» epoken through Its governing body.
has made no statement, has promised nothing
that It has not religiously kept and intends
to keep in the future. The result of the ef
forts of that magnificent organization is be
fore me in one* of the grandest and bwl con
ventions of Republicans that it has ever been
my privilege to see. .
Under our form of government political par
tlen seem to be necessary. Almost 'from the
beginning of the Government the voters have
aliened themselves Into two .great political par
ties. Our personal friends, but political oppo
nents, of the Democratic i>arty have prin
ciple* and Dollcies that to them seem best for
the government of the country. We take Is
sue and think thpy are not for the best. The
Republican party has principles and policies
that to It are dear, and we bellevÂ«. them to
be the best for the country. The Republican
party is the party of protection â protection to
American interests. American workingmen,
American labor and the results of Americau
labor.
CHEERS FOR WILLIAMS.
Clifford McClellan. secretary of the
County Committee, read the. call for the
convention and when he' concluded Mr.
Riordan announced that William R. Xu
nan had been appointed sergeant at arms,
and that his assistants were M. Bannon,
Samuel Davidson, William Richardson,
John Connelly. L. V. Manville. Thomas
Lyons. Lewis Meyerback, A. C. Adams
and Henry Miller.
During the roll call the names of promi
nent deleeates were applauded by those
present. There were few absentees noted.
The delegates looked intelligent and pre
sented an excellent appearance.
Gentlemen of the Convention: As chairman
of the County Committee and as a delegate to
the convention <!aug:iier). I call this conven
tion to order, and now declare the convention
duly oyened for the transaction of business.
It it not my preroeative at this time, nor is it
my wish it it were my prerocative, to make
any remarks. (<"at calle in thp rear of the
hall.) The sergeant-at-arms will eject any
one who indulges in cat calls. This is not a
Pemooratic convention. (Laughter and ap
jiiaui?!-.> 1 v.-as about to pay, gentlemen, that
while il is not my U.:s?ir<Â» to make any remarks.
I may be pfrmitted at this time to say that we
have been convened for the transaction of ex
tremely lmrortant business, and th^rs is very
carnojit and jerlcus work before you, and your
deliberation:- should be conducted !n a spirit
of harmony. It is your duty a? good Republi
cans, elected at the last primary undsr the
auspices of the United Republican League, to
work in harmony, to ust- your best endeavors
to assist the chairman cf your convention and
your secretary in conducting the deliberations
and proceedings of this convention In an or
derly manner, and to maintain that degree of
decorum which is always characteristic of a
Republican convention. (Applause.) If you
will co that I am Katisfi^d that at the con
clusion of this convention you will have pre
nared a ticket composed of nominees that will
be a credit to the convention and that will meet
with the unanimous indorsement of your con
btitucnts.
Th*- secretary of the County Committee will
now r^ad the call for the convention.
Thomas D. Riordan, chairman of the
Republican County Committee, called the
convention to order. He created some
laughter by his sarcastic allusions to the
stormy session of the Democrats the pre
vious evening. He also made quite a hit
by announcing that he opened the con
vention as chairman of the County Com
mittee and also as a delegate. He Spoke
as follows:
man by Acclamation.
John S. Partridge Is Elected Chair-
DOINGS OF CONVENTION.
It is obvious that the delegates have a
free hand- There are indications that the
principles of home rule will be recognized
by giving to each district the opportunity
of naming one nominee for the Board of
Supervisors. The prediction is freely
made that Tax Collector Smith. Auditor
Baehr and Treasurer- McDougald will be
renominated for the positions they re
spectively hold. Many delegates consider
that thrre is a popular demand for the
re-nomination of men who have shown
exceptional fitness in the public service.
The contest for Mayor is wide open to
Republican?. In this instance there is
something like "the office seeking the
man.'" For Assessor there appears to be
a strong current in favor of Charles S.
Laumelster. He is one of the most popu
Jar of citizens and a campaigner of ex
traordinary enterprise. Former State
Senator Thomas C. Maher seems to be
well in the lead for nomination to the
office of Public Administrator. Last even
ing it was announced that William E.
Lutz of the Thirty-ninth District had en
tered the race for Administrator and
rallied many supporters. The convention
will not meet again until Wednesday
evening. September 23. During the recess,
however, committees on platform, order
of business and credentials will frame re

fied style to organize according
to the requirements of law. There was
no confusion or tumult. The speakers of
the evening gave expression to sentiments
of national, State and city pride. The
chairman's place on the platform was
adorned with national flags. Pictures of
Lincoln, Grant. McKinley, Roosevelt and
Pardee were displayed. Spectators re
marked that the convention was as fine
a body of men as ever assembled in San
Krancisco. The van audience of onlook
ers in the gallery did ' not offer
the slightest interruption to the
business of the session. Reference
to the service of eminent Republi
can leaders evoked applause, but there
were no great demonstrations of enthu
siasm. The talk of the speakers was of
the practical, common sense sort, free
from Hlckey, hifalutin and big "two
dollar-and-a-half words." Suggestions for
the advancement and betterment of San
Francisco were offered. The delegates
were advised lo nominate a good ticket
throughout and trust to the intelligent
judgment of the people for indorsement of
the work.
DELEGATES to the Republican
local convention assembled at the
Alhambra Theater last evening
and proceeded in orderly, digni-
the slogan of the Republican party this year
should be. "A new and better San FraneUco."
(Renewed applause). We have, an administra
tion back In Washington, headed by the great
est man living In the world to-day, Theodore
Roosevelt. (Cheers). Under his administra
tion this country has risen to a height of
prosperity such as In the days of Democratic
misrule would have seemed like the fitful fancy
of a fevered dream. You have In Sacramento
a Republican administration beaded by George
C. PanJee (applause), a man who In less than
one year has placed himself alongside of the
greatest Governors of the most ancient com
monwealth. Under his administration Califor
nia has progressed In gigantic stride*, in popu
lation, in wealth, in all material, spiritual and
every kind of well being. But Ban Francisco,
too, is, and of right ought to be. Republican
from North Beach to the county line,- and
from tide water on the west to tide wat?r on
the east. And I say that San Francisco, being
Republican, as she Is, being the most beauti
fully situated city in the world,' ought to be
famed for the parks that t-hould crown her
hills; ought to be famed for the magnificent
buildings that should line her streets; for her
schools where children of the rich and poor
alike might gain that education that would
fit them for the struggle of life: ought to be
famed for a trade extending: wherever com
merce extends, and for the busy, hum of fac
tories that night and day give employment
to countless hordes of happy -and peaceful
artisans. But such a condition of affairs pre
supposes, above everything else In the world,
a high and enduring standard of civic and
political ' virtue and morality; It presupposes
men in every department of the city Govern
ment who will place civic virtue and the good
of this municipality far above- selfish politics
or the aggrandizement of - themselves. We
ehould, therefore, nominate only such men for
office In this city and county; and . If . you do
that, I can see San , FraneUco progressing by
leaps and bounds; I can see her people press-
Ing upward, unafraid for their destiny; I can
We are like an old fellow I used to do busi
ness with over in the old Thirty-third, now
the Thirty-second District. He was a good
friend and great flshter.' and he always took
his whisky straight. I'pon one election day he
started out early in the morning, and the very
rirst thing he did was to fall off the car, knock
the skin off his nose and get into a scrap wltn
a big Democrat and get one eye blackened.
Two or three times durlne the day he got
mixed up with the police for getting too en
thusiastic within 100 feet of the polls. And
then as the shades of night fell around him
he dropped into a little drink emporium out
there to rest and refresh himself after the
cares of that fatiguing day. He called for
Bourbon and filled his glass up to the top, and
somebody asked: "Don't you take any water
in yours?" "Water!" he said: "water! havn't
I had troubles enough for one day? (LAUghter.)
And so it is with us Republicans this year.
In past years we have had troubles enough,
and now our trouble is -to fight the common
enemy, without ever a word to say against
one another. (Applause.)
SLOGAN OF PABTY.
The Republican party this year, for the first
time within my short recollection, is practl
cully a unit. 1 know that there were contests
for delegates in certain districts, but they were
friendly contests, and brother Republicans have
shaken hands, and they will bury their dlffer
f-nceiÂ« deep and stand shoulder to shoulder, arm
to arm, hand to hand, for the success of the
ticket that you will nominate. (Applause.)
Gentlemen of the convention. I thank you.
Last year it was my privilege to preside over
a Republican assemblage like this, and we
nominated a ticket, some of the members of
which we brought under the wire, and unfor
tunately a few of them are running yet.
(Laughter.) Uut this year, because never be
fore in the history of this city has our party
been po harmonious: because never before have
the people realized so fully that Republicanism
means a continuance of prosperity; because
lubor and capital alike realize that their only
chance for fair play lies In the Republican
party â for all these reasonii this year I say we
ought to elect our ticket from top to bottom.
(Applause.)
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS.
Edwin M. Ritter of the Thirty-fourth
Assembly District seconded the nomina
tion in a pleasing- speech, and there being
ho further nominations Partridge was
elepted by. acclamation. Messrs. Beatty
and Ritter escorted the chairman to the
platform and Mr. Riordan turned over
the gavel to him. Partridge had to wait
until the hearty applause had subsided
before he could speak. He then addressed
the convention as follows:
Gentlemen of the Convention: The campaign
that is now about to open is probably the most
serious and presents perhaps the largest Issues
cf any municipal campaign that has yet opened
in the city and county of San Francisco. The
Uuty that will devolve upon this convention Is
to nominate a ticket to uphold, In the words of
the previous speaker, the principles of our
party. Unlike the Democratic party, we have
not only principles, but we have principle, and
we Ehall uphold that principle by nominating
a ticket that shall go to victory at the polls.
We shall nominate a ticket that will drive the
I>â¬mocratic ticket te political oblivion; and I
might add that we shall drive It in the scav-'
enging wagons of the Democratic party to the
tune of the immortal bagpipes.
The first duty that we have to perform here
is the election of a chairman, one who shall be
fair and impartial in his rulings on the deliber
ations that we are about to undertake ; one who
owes allegiance to no faction, who has no af
filiations with any leader: a man in whom we
can place the most implicit trust. I 6hall not
Oetain you further, but shall place in nomina
tion a man whose qualifications are pre-emi
nently those that I have Just described. Gen
tlemen, I nominate Mr. John S. Partridge.
Nominations for temporary chairman
were then declared in order, and H. O.
Beatty of the Forty-first District ascend
ed the platform and nominated John S.
Partridge. He spoke in part as follows:
Hut we come to San Fraiscisco; San Fran
cisco, the queen city cf the* Pacific, standing
at the gateway of the Orient, i in my judgment,
is to bt'L-orhe rnc of the great populous, busi
ness, commercial and financial centers o" the
world. The policy of the Republican uarty
has been to plant that olii flas upon the islands
of tiie ocean, carrying liberty, intelligence,
moral worth and justice to other people â and
1 say, by the way. that the party that planted
that flas there has planted it to stay, and it
will never, be hauled down by any act of a
Republican administration. (Applause).
Kan Francis ?o! Progressive fc-an Krancisco!
The signs of the times can be read by any of
you tf'at we must progress-, that we havÂ» got
to make this city what it ought to be and
what wesjio^ie it will be. San Francisco needs
;nany thines. She needs good school houses
and plenty of them, that the boys and Klrls
that are coming ui> now tr take your dace
and mine may be equipped with that mental
training eo necessary to battle with the vicis
situdes of life in the world. She needs better
cewers, better health' facilities, that the death
rate may be lowered and tho health of the city
tie improved. She needs better hospital-* for
the unfortunate: she needs parks and breathing
places for the- laboring man. as well as every
other: but above and beyond all. San Fran
cisco needs an intelligent, honest, economical
government of her affairs. (Applause).
Gentlemen of the municipal convention, you
have been elected . free and untrammeled, ; no
obligations expressed or im^'Ied. It is in your
power to trive the voters of this city such a
ticket a* will merit and. receive their supoort.
If >ou will do that â and it is In your hands
to do Itâ I believe that' you will elect the en
tire ticket from t&p to bottom. (Applause).
When the enthusiasm had subsided "Wil
liam S. Wood, the well known attorney,
arose and moved that the thanks of the
convention be extended Senator Williams
for his splendid services. The motion was
adopted with a unanimous vote by the
delegates.

country on the face of God's preen earth. (Ap
plnuse.) The wonderful prosperity of this na
tion, the wonderful prosperity of this State,
the phenomenal prosperity of this city, in our
judgment, are very largely due to the policies
and ;>rincir>Ies of the Republican party. A
dittin^uished gentleman, speaking last night,

Mr. William White of 502 Powell street, well

Â¦ half years ago by several physicians as
throni<: Brighfs Disease. Grew wors^
rapidly, and a year later had to give up
his position Went to Byron Springs;
then to St. Luke's Hospital. Remained at
tie latter six weeks, and becoming dls-

ally worse, he then went to the Waldeck
Sanitarium, remaining three weeks. Then

Bulgaria Must Choose One or the
Other Alternative.
SOFIA, Bulgaria. Sept. 15.â Following
are some of the points in the note which
Bulgaria has just presented to the pow
ers:
What the Bulzarian Government had fore
seen, as expressed in its note of June 29, of
the development of nflajrs in Turkey has be
come amply verified. The Turkish Govern
ment is systematically annihilating the Bul
garian people.
The mobilization and concentration of such
great forces in European Turkey, under the
pretext of suppressing the revolution, give
liulfraria. reason to furrvjf^ that at an oppor
tune moment she will be attacked by Turkey.
The Uuicarian Government can no longer
remain indifferent to the presence of f=uch a
situation, which is of a nature calculated to
Â»>rir.g about a hostile cc!lii-lon between Tur
k< v and Uulcaria.
If the great powers do not take measures to

of moderation the Bulgarian Government will

Replying to notes of the Turkish repre
sentative here, in which it was alleged
that the insurrection in Macedonia was
the work of Bulgarian bands which had
crossed the frontier, the Bulgarian Gov
ernment on Saturday last made answer
refuting ' the - accusations, reviewing the
histroy of the Insurrection and claiming
that the outbreak was the direct result of
Thc latest nnws from Constantinople says the
Porte is mobilizing the last line of reserves, in
cluding men about 50 years of age.
Yesterday came a telegram from Burgas eay-
Ing that a company of Turkish troops, while
passing near a frontier post. Â¦ was saluted by tho
Bulgarian guard, but the Turkish officer did not
acknowledge the salute, turned his back, and
afterward remarked to the Bulgarian officer In
command: "Wnen we have finished here . we
will come and pep you." Reports have also
been received of Turkish troops crossing the
Bulgarian frontier, carrying off sheep and com
mitting Â«-ther depredations.
. Confronted by 6uch conditions, Bulgaria is
forced to the conviction that Turkey intends to
attack her. and the Sofia Government has taken
this last etep of asking the powers to intervene.
Otherwise Bulgaria must take measures for her
own protection.
The Porte was only too anxious to have a
pretext for continuing the massacres and the
extermination of the liuj&arian people. Turkey
hag now concentrated .''.(M.OOU troops in Mace
donia, only about "5,000 of whom are engaged
in thc suppression of the revolt. There is no
attempt to light the insurgents, but the troops
attack Innocent women and children. The Bul
garian Government is forced to perceive in this
excessive mobilization a clear sign of Turkey's
desire, after she has succeeded in suppressing
the outbreak In 1 Macedonia, to attack Bulgaria
and exterminate the Bulgarian race. All our
latest Information from Macedonia and Con
stantinople confirms this view.
Hilinl Pasha, the Vali of Salonica, has openly
declared that war with Bulgaria is the only
way of settling the 'Macedonian question. The
Constantinople press, which Is under the most
severe censorship, was recently allowed to pub
lish the most sensational reports, with the ob
ject of increasing the Mussulmans' fanatic hat
red of. the Bulgarian Christians.
It has been from the first plainly evident that
the policy of Turkey was to hinder the develop
ment of the Dulgarian race in Macedonia,
which was the fctrcugt-st national element there.
With this end In view the Turks proceeded to
devastate the country and kill the Bulgarian
Christians, driving the survivors into the moun
tains and forests, where they would either per
i?h of hunger or gj across the Bulgarian fron
tier and become a burden to the Bulgarian na
tion. In the meanwhile the powers paid not
the. Â£lightet>t attention to the Bulgarian note of
June 'M, but rather encouraged the Turks, who
adopted the moFt severe measures to suppreRS
the outbreak. The Bulgarian Government is
now compelled to protect not only Uulgarla
itself, but also the Bulgarian element in Mace
donia. It Is further evident that Turkey' hos
dirt-etly encouraged the revolution, as, with ten
times as mdtiy guards on the frontier as Jiulâ
gariu employed, the Turks never stopped a sin
gle revolutionary band nor an individual cross
ing the frontier.

LONDON, Sept. 16.-The St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Daily Telegraph
claims to have the highest authority for
Â«sa>-ing that Russia's Balkan policy is to
isolate Bulgaria by refusing to stop the
Macedonian massacres and inducing tho
powers to remain; inactive. Then, when
Turkey has defeated Bulgaria, Russia
will insist on stepping in and occupying
Bulgaria. under the pretext of protecting
her. Thus Bulgaria would 1 become Rus
sia's vassal. Minister White's removal,

Mrs. Smith Sent to Jail.
The charge of assault with a deadly
weapon against Mrs. Annie Smith was re
duced to y battery by Police Judge Slogan
yesterday and she was sentenced to serve
six months in the County Jail. During a
fight in the Wilcox House, on Stevenson
street, on August 19, Mrs. Smith cut John
Donnelly of 1SD Fourth street on" the
hands and face with a knife.
Mr. "Woodworth expects to have the
case ready for presentation to the Grand
Jury by the latter part of next week.
Regarding new developments, if any, ho
declines to speak.
Tom Yung, the Chinese merchant ac
cused by the substitutes of having bribed
them with $C0 each to take the places of
the escaped prisoners, has engaged Bert
Schleslnger to defend him In court. Ho
denies totally the statements made by the
substitute*. ;::..,
the bureau to interfere unless directly
ordered from Washington so to do.
Such is undoubtedly the case, and the
more's the pity. The experience of the
past should suggest to the head of the
Immigration Department at the Xatlonal
Capitol the necessity of providing for the
proper identification of every Chinese per
son taken on board the steamer to be de
ported or remanded.
Chinese Inspector Boyce was put to
work yesterday on the records In the of
fice of the clerk of the United States Dis
trict Court owing - to certain Information
that Â¦ had been conveyed to the Chinese
Bureau. Here are kept all the records
of - habeas; corpus or remand cases, and
also of Chinese found unlawfully in the
country' and ordered deported. It has
been observed that for the last two years
the clerk's office has been resorted to by
Chinese who are engaged in securing the
landing of : their countrymen by the ha
beas corpus route. They have . made a
Gamble's confession stamps as untrue
the statement of Hackdriver Martin, who
claims he received the Chinamen at thc
County Jail, but this is denied by the
deputy marshal, who says he engaged
him to drive the substituted ones from
the Appraiser's building to the Mall dock.
It is expected that more arrests will fol
low to-day, as It is known that the Gov
ernment officials have gathered a mass
of evidence showing that a wholesale
conspiracy existed to defeat the matter
of deporting Chinese.
When asked if he realized the chances
he was | taking when he entered into the
conspiracy, Gamble remarked: "We never
dreamed of being caught. It was so
easy., so. well arranged, that we did not
think tha.t there was the least chance
of ' being discovered." From these re
marks the secret service men are inclined
to believe that Gamble is not telling:
everything in connection with the scheme
and Is anxious to shield other persons
who are equally guilty.
After a short investigation he satisfied
the officials that he was innocent and
was released.
Yesterday and last night Gamble was
busily engaged in Chinatown, supposed
ly endeavoring to gather evidence to as
sist the cause of the Government. This
is taken as an indication that he has the
assurance of the officials that he will not
be severely dealt with If he lends his aid
in exposing the conspiracy.
Yesterday the Government detectives
arrested a well known Chinese named
Tom Young on suspicion that he was a
party to the deep laid conspiracy to de
feat the ends of the exclusion act.
ABBESTED AND RELEASED.
Gamble declared to District Attorney
Woodworth that only the two Chinamen
who were with him in the deal knew any
thing about the substitution of tho old
Chinese for the ones who were unjder sen
tence of deportation. Notwithstanding his
positive statement the secret service peo
ple are industriously working on the case
with the hope of enmeshing others in the
dragnet, as they are satisfied that other

Federal Grand Jury Report
The Westminster Gazette says: "All old season's
jams have gone up twopence a jar, and the new sea
son's is half as dear again as it was this time last
year, and the prices are rising. Lucky the house- ;
keeper who lays in a store at once, for there are dark
hints abroad about the future supply â extraordinary
prices are prophesied."
Jams and jellies are not the only delicacies of the
kingdom in which there will be a shortage by reason
of the heavy rains. A British rural paper, "Country
Life," says: "Of those who have suffered most from
the excessive moisture of the year the bee master has
the strongest grounds of complaint- In the south
every, show of blossom on which the apiarian rests
his hopes -appeared, only to be drenched and de
stfoyed with new showers of rain. Near the moors,
where a second harvest is expected from the"neather,
things are still worse."
In the face of the losses thus inflicted by the heavy
rains to which the islands are liable at every
season, the present high price of fruit is encouraging
many laud-owners to undertake the plantation of fur
ther orchards. One authority says: "The industry is
being extended, and planters are paying more atten
tion, to the claims of dwarf trees and"salable kinds.
The demand for choice fruit in the wholesale markets
throughout the United Kingdom is limitless, and at
excellent prices. I calculate th; t the financial re
ceipts from British fruit farms range from Â£3,000,000
to Â£6,000,000 a year. The smaUness of the total is
due to the fact that the poor returns from the almost
countless numbers of useless trees which Jncumber
the ground tell upon the average." v *- â¢
It is of course natural the British jam-eater should
look t<~. the orchards of his own country to furnish
the fruit from which the. delicacy is made, but he
would be wiser to look to California. With a better
transportation system and with more equitable rates
for hauling across the continent California could fur
nish the British market with a sure supply of fruit,
cheaper than it can be produced in England and of
a much better grade. Sir Thomas Lipton is now in
this country on a yachting expedition, but before he
goes home he would do well to come to California
and study the probable profits that would result from
establishing here a manufacturing plant for putting
up every kind of fruit preserve his British public de
mands. It is the safest source of supply, and will as
sure the Briton of jam, for breakfast no matter how
the rains may pour down upon his native island.
LONDON papers in dealing with the recent in
crease in the price of jam, a serious question in
Great Britain, do not attribute it to any ar
bitrary action on the part of Sir Thomas Lipton or
of any combination of manufacturers of fruit con
serves; but to the well nigh universal shortage in the
supply of fruits out of which jams are made. The
shortage of the crops is due to excessive moisture
which appears to have affected all parts of the British
Islands and a considerable part of the Continent.
BRITAIN AND HER JAM.
Yesterday was the busiest of the year
in the Custom-house, the receipts being
PS 000 whereas the usual day's receipts
seldom exceed $15,000. The getting out of
"general orders" for the Chung Wo and
the Hongkong Maru, and the settling of
duties on the cargoes of the same caused
considerable additional labor. Acting Col
lector Hamilton abdicated his thro:o on
tho third floor and took his Special Dep
uty desk on the second floor and lent a
hand in the work. Cashier Perkins kept
his office open until 3:J3 p. rn. to accom
modate the brokers, and every clerk in
the Custom-house was impressed into ser

The people of Illinois appear to be utterly lacking
in a sense of the spectacular. The authorities of the

efforts to secure man hunters to capture a desperate
murderer. Let California's glorious example be made
kyown. Turn out the militia, let the bands play to
the accompanying cheers of men and the lan
guishingsmiies of women. Give everybody a thrill,
and if Illinois bad men are like California bad men
they won't mind it in the least, but will pursue the
even tenor of their murderous way.
A wedding that means much to Califor

Miss Georgia Sullivan, the winsome sister

White, Miss Adah Sullivan and Miss Fan

The young lady went East three years
ago to pursue vocal studies, and while a

daughter of the West and the son of the

almost upon the eve of the bond issue
election, wide interest attaches to the
subject. Surely few are better fitted by
education or temperament to discuss the
subject than Mr. Keeler. who not only
sees things in his travels, but who can
tell what he sees. Mrs. Thomas W. Col

has contributed liberally to the entertain

The Women's Press Association held its
first meeting on Monday afternoon at
Century Hall and the excellent attendance
bespoke the value of a period of summer
inactivity. The club ha3 outlined many
interesting afternoons for the entertain
ment of its members and friends, the first
of which takes place on September 23.
The absence of the president, Mrs. Flor
ence Percy Matheson, i3 much regretted.
but her efficient corps of officers is doing
excellent work in the matter of stimulat
ing interest in the club's doings. It has
been facetiously said by the cynics that
in prdÂ«r to become a member of the W o
men's Press Club one shall not be a. wri
ter, but a perusal of the roster eliminates
any such accusation from the domain of
truth. Mrs. Matheson will return from
New York next month, when her visit to
her mother, Mrs. Akers (the author of the
poem "Rock Me to Sleep, Mother") will
have terminated.
A wedding of much interest will take
place to-day in the picturesque town of
Woodland, when Miss Loui3e Stevens will
wed Dr. M. W. Plummer of San Fran
cisco. . â,
The Rev. O. P. Shrout of "Woodland will
perform the ceremony, which will be wit
nessed only by the immediate relatives.
The families cf both bride and groom
are among the oldest and most esteemed
in their respective communities, the fatn
er of the groom, the late Dr. R. W. Plum
mer, being affectionately remembered by
hosts' of old families in San Francisco as
physician and friend. The family of the
bride has been identified with the prog
ress of the Sacramento Valley for many
years, and the loss to domestic social cir
cles of so charming a member will be
keenly felt. The prospective bride â¢ is
statuesque in figure, of intellectual bent
and possessed of the culture and poise
that is developed by travel.
The groom resides at the Hotel Pleas
anton. but the future residence of the
couple is as yet undetermined.
The California Club met yesterday aft

sense in children was effectively discussed
and the best method to obtain desirable
results was decided to be through the
medium of wholesome, artistic pictures.
The members gathered in the f ulb pano

aftermath in the tearoom followed. Mrs.

Next Tuesday the day will be given over

of an informal reception, and It Is a safe
prediction that no able-bodied member
will fall to greet Mrs. Smith in the man
ner befitting her exceptional work of con

At high noon yesterday Mrs. Phoebe
Hearst gave Into the keeping of Dr. Jo
seph Marshall Flint her favorite niece,
Miss Anne Apperson. The ceremony was
performed by the Rev. N. S. Gallwey in
the presence of seventy-five guests, many
of whom journeyed from the East to
witness the happy event. The maid of
honor. Miss Ella Woolworth, was a
schoolmate of the bride in New York.
F. R. S. Balfour officiated as best man.
Hacienda del Pozo de Verona is well
adapted for impressive ceremonies and in
its spacious dining hall an elaborate
breakfast was served. In the afternoon
the young couple left for Wyntoon, Mrs.
Hearsfs charming home on the McCloud
River. Here in this ideal spot the honey
moon will be passed.
Second â Now as to the simplicity and rea
sonableness of the American system. The
children are first taught to sing the major
scale, applying the syllables, do, re, mi, etc.,
as above. This practice is for the purpose of
establishing the relationship of the tones of
the scale as to the intervals, including larger
Intervals of Â¦which chords are composed. Thin
Is of paramount importance. Jt is the founda
tion work for mental training, to think the
tones, to know the exact pitch of any tone
reckoned from the ionic or one. With this sort
of practice it becomes very easy to change
the key by establishing (mentally) any pitch
or tone as the tonic, from which the singers
proceed with ease, accuracy and success.
After having learned the order of scale in
tervals, "starting with do (do, re, ml. etc.). -It
is, indeed, very difficult to pass over the game
ord^r of Interval* (whole steps and half steps)
with the syllables re ml fa. mi fa Â»ol. etc.
It ia tedious. illoKical and inconsistent. It is
like learning another language or another
alphabet. If the fixed Vdo" is to be the sys
tem the "do" and all of the other syllables
should be eliminated, as they are .tnincum
brance, a burden and a stumbling biock, and
the attention should be given entirely to in
tervals, os from C to D (a whole " steo or
major second). D to K, the same; C sharp
to I> (a half-step or minor second), etc.. which
is not elementary or primary, but belongs to
more advanced steps in a course of sight
Pinging, such as 13 most suitable and de
manded in the public schools.
If is difficult for those wno have learned
to ying the scale by the usual syllables to
dissociate the syllables from the scale tones
and the more surely this Is established â a
fixed factâ the better sight readers we shall
have among the singers who come from the
public school*. Again, such a system should
be taught that will, as a consequence. Implant
in the mind and musical sense melodic ideas.
For instance, do re mi fa. as a melody,
does not produce the same effect, melodlcally
or harmonically, as sol latl do, and yet the
interval are the same. The first suggest
movement or unrest, and the second repose.
The American system establishes this to a
certainty. The ' "fixed do" would be all right
if absolute pitch were to be learned, but
that is Impracticable. The game would not
pay for the powder. School life Is too short.
In this connection 1 must adviae those who
teach music in the public schools against the
too common practice of rote singing. It is
a waste of t'me and money, for It does not
teach intervals, the relationship of tones in
the scale nor the melodic idea, as aforesaid.
Furthermore., it Is a waste of time to teach
the tonic-sol-fa notation because It is ephe
meral, while the staff notation Is universal â
ag s "written language." School directors
should be wise enough to appreciate this point.
Not one system of reading for children and
another for adults. Mr. Roncovierl says: "No
"one who champions the (movable <2o> system
has ever done anything in mus.ic.that has
been heard of, while of those who stick
to the old-established method have climbed
to the top of the ladder in the musical world."
I understand that he means any "'movable do"
system. If so his information is painfully
limited, as there are thousands of them In this
country, from before Lowell Mason's time to
the present. ' and they have be*n the real
musical educators of the people. To them be
longs the credit of advancing the cause and
a knowledge of music at a rapid pace. They
have laid a good and abiding foundation upon
which the musical structure is gradually and
surely being erected.
Again he says: "It is a complex method."
Not so. It is the simplest method ever de
vised or system ever formulated. The "fixed
do" ia superlatively complex â the clow coach,
lumbering system of. the distant post. It has
no place in these times of creat speed, rapid
progress and quick conclusions. But to fritter
away time, even In the primary grades of
our public schools, with the ton'.c-sol-fa no
tation is the pinnacle of folly. It is teaching
two written languages, or musical notations,
when one (the staff) answers the best and
every purpose -for the pictorial representation
of music. This subject is of vital moment and
should be thoroughly studied and wisely acted
upon by Boards of Education, supervisors of
music and those who are entrusts with the
teaching of sight singing In our public schools.
H. S. PERKINS.
The history of the -"fixed do," when coming
in competition with the "movable do," has
always bten that the former takes a back
seat or retires. And why? Because It is slow,
tedious and lumbering. It la like a Mexican
cart compared with an American vehicle con
structed for a similar purpose. The Yankee,
go-ahead idea will not tolerate any slow,
tedious process when a shorter cut can be
made with equally as good or better results.
We do not progress backward. The "tonic
pol-fa" system, which the article says Miss
Carpenter introduced into the San Francisco
schools, is the American method in so far as
the tonic or one of the major scale Is always
"do," and one of the minor (the related
minor) is always "la." That is all. The no
tation (without the staff) is the objectionable
feature and its life will be short and sectional
in this country.
Miss Glover, a school teacher in England,
first introduced it there for the purpose of
having an easier, simpler and more successful
means of teaching .the school children than
the "fixed do" In the Government schools- un
der the general superlntendency of John Hul
lah. She had sufficient genius to discover that
it was much easier, more logical and sys
tematic to sing the scale In every major key
just the same, thus: Do, re. ml, fa. sol. la. tl,
do. Hev. â¢ John Curwin, also a philosopher,
logician and educational expert, formulated the
scheme of Miss Glover and introduced it into
the schools of England, where It has almost
entirely supplanted the fixed do.
When in London several years ago It was
my privilege to listen to an exposition of the
two methods in the public schools in company
Â¦with the two Kreat leaders. Mullah and Cur
win; also to great demonstrations at the
Crystal Palace. The. tonic sol-fa-ists were
by far the better sight singers or readers.
Mr. Curwin, however, stated that he should
have introduced the American system â the
movable do, with the staff notation â had he
been familiar with it.
Dr. Perkins, whose communication on
the "Sliding Do" appears below, 13 director
of the Chicago National College of Music.
He is a well-known editor of church
music, and has always taken great in
terest in teaching music in the public
schools. He has been well known as a
musical critic for more than a quarter of
a century. He was for fifteen years
president of the Illinois State Music
Teachers' Association and many years
the secretary of the National Association.
His communication on a topic of local in
terest is as follows:
CHICAGO. Sept. 8. 1903.
Editor San Francisco Call: In the August
24 Issue of an evening newspaper of your city
I have read a dissertation upon the "Sliding
Do," which is an exposition of the views en
tertained by Mr. Roncovlerl. one of your
public School Directors. In Its relation to the
teaching of singing or "sol-fa-In*." The ar
gument, text or declaration is put In the form
of an interrogation, thus:
"Shall the note 'do" as used by singers re
main stuck hard and fast on the" first line
below the staff at C. or shall it go sliding
up and down the scale at the pleasure of
whatever key the singer desires to pitch the
tune?"
If the concensus of public opinion were to
settle the question the decision would be In
favor of the "sliding do," especially from
singing class teachers and those who read vo
cal music at sight or without the aid of an
instrument. Although this matter baa been
thrashed over many timea and as many times
settled in this country. thÂ«re is a small minor
ity In favor of tfcs "fixed do." This ques
tion, however, being of public interest I desire
to rewly, and must take issue with Mr. Ron
covierl. . ;-'
First, the "fixed do" Is a foreigner and the
"movable do" la an American. That settles
the question. If not the controversy. It has
been settled in this country for over one hun
dred years. If it were true that the rank and
fll3 of singers in Eastern countries, including
Italy, are as good sight readers as Americans
who have studied singing from the movable
do method it would not Â¦ be a sufficient rea
son for changing the American system and
substituting the foreign. It will not be
changed any more than our republican form
of government will be changed to monarchical.
A few teachers 'may advocate the "fixed do,
and, possibly, a few cities may adopt it. San
Francisco may be one of them, but it will
have a short life.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Sept. 13.â Dr. Iv
roy Anderson, the director of the State
Polytechnic School here, announces that
owing to some delays in the completion of
the buildings the school will not be able
to open for students upon the date fixed
for the opening, September 13, but that
the date for the opening ha3 been post
poned until September 30. The contract
ors are finishing their work as rapidly as
possible and It 13 confidently expected
that the school will be ready to receive
pupils September 30. However. It la not
expected that the recitation building will
be fully completed at that date, but a
number of the rooms will be ready for
occupancy at the time set and the dor
mitory will be ready for students.
Applications for admission are being
daily received and the school will start
under the most favorable auspices. It
Is understood that the curriculum as ar
ranged is quite comprehensive. Besides
instruction in thÂ© academic branches,
training will be given in the arts and sci
ences which deal peculiarly with the Ufa
of the home, the farm, the orchard, the
dairy and the shop.
The school is not desljned, to occupy
a place in the regular school system of
the State as that system U generally un
derstood. Its course of study is arrang
ed solely in view of the needs of the boy
or girl who is going to earn a livelihood,
after eompletins Â«" course and prepare
them for industrial life.

PUBLIC UTILITY ' BONDS.
THE TERRIBLE TURK.
EVERY ONE will concede that if public utilities
are to pass into public ownership and adminis
tration they should be in every way safe- :
guarded to secure honest, economical business man
agement. Such management is impossible when the
consequences of a lack of it can be concealed by
merging the business with the purely political part
of government. . . - *
Herbert Spencer, the English philosopher whose
works have for forty years formed and directed hu
man thought in the great affairs of life, says: "Of
ficialism is habitually slow. When non-governmental
agencies arc dilatory the public has its remedy; it
ceases to employ them and soon finds quicker ones.
Under this discipline all private bodies are taught
promptness. But for delays in public business there
is no such easy cure. Officialism is extravagant.
Public agencies are subject to no such influence as
that which obliges private enterprise to be economi
cal. Traders and mercantile bodies succeed by ( serv
ing society cheaply. Such of them as cannot do this
are continually supplanted by those who can. They
cannot saddle the nation with the result of their
extravagance, and so are prevented from being ex
travagant."
These philosophical principles apply everywhere
to the attempt of government to go into business.
The Gas and Electric Light Commission of Massa
chusetts reports: "Eighteen cities in Massachusetts
own and operate their lighting plants. Of these fif
teen are electric plants only, and three operate gas
and electricity. The expenses of these eighteen
cities in operating their plants for the year ending
June 30, 1900, were $148,364 21 greater than their in
come, and that sum was charged in the taxes to the
cost of street lighting. The balance-sheet of the
lighting plants of these eighteen cities showed a de
ficit for the year of $157,641 25."
Yet when the people of those cities were being
urged to have them go into the business of selling
light they were lured by the promise of great cheap
ness and great profit. In the case of most of them
it is probably true that the taxpayers would be in ig
norance of the loss in the business charged to them
as taxes were they not informed by the State com
mission. The bonds issued to acquire the lighting
plants were made liens upon the taxpayers, who pay
interest and principal and make up also the deficits
due to wasteful public management. When the city
of Worcester was urged to go into the lighting busi
ness a committee of experts examined the results in'
the other towns which are in that business. The
finding was that under public ownership the cost
of light to the citizens averaged twice as much as
under private ownership. But part of it they paid
as ratepayers and part as taxpayers, and the latter
was concealed in their general tax receipt, and they
were robbed by public ownership without being
able to detect it.
Turn where one will the story is the same, and it
admonishes the people of this city and Oakland to go
slowly and wisely in entering into a scheme of public
ownership. It is useless to say that here the policy
will succeed under conditions that have been present
in Its failure everywhere else. We can at least start
right by voting down all propositions to make pub
lic utility bonds, a Hen on the city and insisting that
they shall te Jie.ns only on the plant that they create,
and that all such plants shall support themselves and
no deficit? shall be charged off to the taxpayers or
paid out of the general fund. \
If the Geary-street Railroad will pay its cost and
expenses its bonds need not be a lien on the city,
for it can carry them. If it cannot be so operated
Â«$ to pay its cost and expense of operating, the defi
cit should not be charged off to the taxpayers, but
should be met by an increase in fares paid by those
who patronize it. That is the business way to run
business, whether by public or private agencies, and
so far no valid objection to it has been suggested by
the advocates of public ownership. If they believe
that public utilities can be run cheaper, better and
more profitably by the city, they should be eager to
prove it by basing the funds on the plant and keep
ing the business separate, so that it can prove with
out doubt the superior virtue of public ownership.
A San Diego man who was on trial recently for
murder presented in his defense the fact that the
man he killed had six notches in his gun and was
feared as a very bad man. What a change has come
over the spirit of California life. The time "was when
a man with only six notches in his gun had yet to
learn the gentle art of murder in the wild and
woolly West.
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE.
In the approaching election in New York both
Democrats and Republicans have united upon one
man for re-election to his position, as a member of
the Court of Appeals, thus insuring the continuance
of his sen-ice to the State. It is seldom that in this
manner American politics subordinates itself to prin
ciple and in doing so exalts and dignifies its appeal
to partisans.
Several Montana robbers attempted recently to
carry off a safe and failed. They have evidently neg
lected a very necessary apprenticeship in their pro
fession. A short residence in California will convince
them that the theft of a hot stove is no more un
usual than the j rifling of the quarters of the police in
the Hall of Justice, and both are accepted as ordinary
incidents of the art of pilfering. It requires in Cali
fornia the theft of an entire town, as was done re
cently in Alameda County, to excite even the cu
riosity of observers.
THE Turk has a bad name, but it is as well not
to accuse him of sucking eggs on insufficient
testimony. The daily reports sent through va
rious news channels of wholesale slaughter and moun
tain sides slippery with the blood of the innocent may
be taken with caution. In the beginning of the pres
ent revolution the Christians burned some Mahome
tan mosques full of worshiping followers of the
Prophet, and no doubt there have been retaliations.
All revolutions exalt the imagination and are at
tended by reports of remarkable atrocities. One
needs but to go back to the tales and fables told by
both sides during our Civil War to appreciate this.
The world has become accustomed to stories about
the inhumanity of the Turks and their fanatical
hatred of Christian?. But the fact is that there are
many Christian Turks and many of them have held
high places in the government and confidence of the
Sultan. He has been represented here by a Minister
'.vho was a Christian, and until this country puts in
such high places some of the able Chinese Buddhists
end Confucians who are our fellow citizens it is not
in order to gird at the ugly man of Stamboul.
A few years ago we were much excited over the
Armenian massacres. Daily reports were made of
the number slain. Our Congress got excited, and
one Senator made an impassioned attack on Presi
dent Cleveland because he did not send our navy
"into the Golden Horn to throw hot shot through
the grand Seraglio.-' â¢ Finally one gentleman, who
had a turn for mathematics and statistics, collected
the reports of slaughter, and, putting them together,
discovered that, according to them, the whole pop
ulation of Armenia had been exterminated ten times.
The news makers had reported the murder of ten
times- as many people aÂ» were in the country. So
it appeared that every Armenian had been killed ten
times, slaughtered, butchered and done away with
ten times. Yet that more than cat-like population
seems to be alive and active to-day and able to burn
mosques and roast Mahometans to a turn. It
is said that Government officials so well understand
the capacity of the correspondents for murdering
Christians in their imagination that they keep their
own bureaus of information and are able to properly
discount the number slaughtered by telegraph.
It is no doubt true that a good many people are
getting killed. That is a common and, let us admit,
a necessary feature in revolutions. Turk and Chris
tian go down in a common fate, and the ex-bandits
who have been transformed into Christian revolu
tionists are no amateurs at butchery. It is probable
that dishonors are ea=y. No one would object to the
success of the revolution. If Bulgaria and Servia
would join and make a combined attack on the Turk
he would find his hands full, and the woman slayers
of Belgrade would find a congenial occupation.
The whole matter is a revolution, as. much so as
the French revolution of 1793, and so far much less
bloody than the Reign of Terror. American interest
in it is limited to the protection of our nationals who
may be in the zone of disturbance". If we doathis, and
otherwise keep cool and drive in the middle of the
road, our full duty is discharged. We have no mis
fion to convert the world, drive t.ie Turk into Asia
or do any of the extraordinary things demanded of
our Government by the excited people who think
that the criminality of an act exists only in the re
ligion professed by the actor.
DESPITE reports from time to time that the
United States Commission on International
. Exchange has had but little success in Eu
rope, it appears there has been accomplished about
as much as the Commissioners hoped for, and that
the prospects of permanent good resulting from the
various international conferences are decidedly
bright. In fact, Commissioner Jenks in a recent let
ter on the subject says: "The mission has been en
tirely successful."
Reports of failure on the part of the commission
were due to a misapprehension of its purpose. It
was generally believed to have for its object the for
mation, of an agreement among the powers to "do
something for silver." No such object, however, was
entertained. Commissioner Jenks says: "The pri
mary purpose of the Commission on International
Exchange has been to promote the extension of the
gold standard to China and other silver-using coun
tries. It has been in this sense distinctively a gold
commission rather than a silver commission."
The 'republic of Mexico, while preparing to put
her own currency on the gold basis, thought proper
to ask other silver-using countries to join her in the
lask. Most of such countries are in a position to
act for themselves, but in the case of China it was
recognized that outside influence would have to be
brought to bear. Had any single power undertaken
to reorganize Chinese finance the jealousy of other
powers would have been aroused and serious antag
onism would have interfered with the progress of
the work. It was, then, for the purpose of' clearing
the way of diplomatic obstacles that the Commission
on International Exchange decided to confer with
the powers of Europe. . Â¦ â¢ 'Â¦ '"-Â¦ â¢ <."Â» vs.
The time is propitious for a movement toward put
ting China on a gold basis because of the fact that no
less than three nations are now introducing the gold
standard into' their dependencies in the Orient, and
considerable progress has been made by each. Our
own Government has provided. for the currency of
the Philippines, Great Britain has taken preliminary
steps for carrying out the reform programme in the
Straits Settlements, and France has done the same
for her possessions in Indo-China. With these

movements going on around her it is certainly de
sirable that the coinage 'of China be brought into
harmonious relations with the currency of other
countries. â¢
In reviewing the work of .the commission Mr.
Jenks says: "The advantages of the plan are so ob
vious that the European powers when consulted have
one and all agreed that the establishment of the
gold standard in China is desirable and practicable.
The mission of the Mexican and American commis
sions has been entirely successful. It is only one
step, but an important one, toward dowering China
with the gold standard of other civilized nations.
The methods by which the gold standard is to be
introduced may be subject of some difference? of
opinion. It is not possible in the space assigned to
this note to discuss them all in detail. It is sufficient
to say that the method proposed has been in suc
cessful operation for twenty years in the Netherlands
and the island of Java; was introduced into British
India in 1897, and has recently been sanctioned by
the Congress of the United States for the Philippine
Islands. * * * In the Philippines and in China
it has been felt that it would not be practicable to
introduce a large gold circulation, because wages
range from ten to twenty cents a day in gold, and a
sovereign or a five-dollar gold piece would repre
sent nearly the earnings of a month. The subdivi
sions of transactions are so minute that a large use
of silver is necessary. That silver it is proposed to
maintain at a gold parity by maintaining a gold re
demption fund in the manner proved best by the ex
perience of other gold standard countries."

740 Market StreetCaptain George "Washington Ruthers, U.
S. A., intends to contest the suit to an
nul his marriage brought by his wife,
Gladys Gray Dorsey Ruthers. S. S. Spll
man, his attorney, filed an appearance for
him yesterday. Mrs. Ruthers is the
daughter of Attorney John Webster Dor
sey and Mattie Brinkerhoff Dorsey, whose
matrimonial troubles were aired in the
courts just a few weeks prior to her mar
riage to the army officer. It was a run
away match, and was followed by a trip
to the Orient. Mrs. Ruthers returned
alone a few months after the marriage
and instituted annulment proceedings,
claiming that when she married Ruthers
she was under age and had not secured
the consent of her parents.
Suits for divorce were also filed by Dan
iel Hawley against Lottie Hawley for de
sertion, Augusta McCormlck against John
F. McCormick for' desertion, Alice Ben
jamin against Louis Benjamin for neglect
and Lizzie Shepard against George H.
Shepard for cruelty.
Divorces were granted to Sara Soracco
from F. W. Soracco for cruelty, Charles
T. Quirey from Mary Quirey for deser
tion, Lucia Jenkins from John . C. Jen
kins for desertion, Frank S. Gray from
Mattle Gray for desertion, Sarah E. Gary
from Edward E. Gary for neglect and
Mary J. Smith from George S. Smith for
neglect.
Alphonse Smith, a machinist, residing at
2631 Harrison street, is being sued for di
vorce by Catherine Smith on the ground
of cruelty. Smith's appetite seems to be
the cause of their marital unhappiness.
Mrs. Smith says that he is a "good eater"
and demands that his table be abundant
ly supplied with all the delicacies of the
season. She claims that she has always
endeavored to cater to his likes and dis
likes in the food line, but somehow fails
to please him. She says he abuses her
and accuses her of extravagance.
Captain Theodore .Schmolholz, for many
years a prominent member of the Na
tional Guard of California, appeared in
Judge Troutt's court yesterday, carrylns
a baseball bat, a number of sticks of
wood and a torn and tattered picture of
himself in full regimentals. He was the
defendant in a suit for divorce brought
by Sophie Schmolholz, and the bat, the
picture and the sticks of wood were In
tended by him to serve as mute evidence
of the tyranny and cruelty of his wife.
They were accepted as evidence and duly
marked defendant's exhibits A, B and C.
They did not serve their purpose, how
ever, for Mrs. Schmolholz outflanked the
captain and backed by the testimony of

Accused Burglars in Court.
Most of the COO who have filed on claims
and not yet proved up will offer their
proof and pay their money, relying on
the former interpretation of the word
â¢â¢speculation" being continued in force
EUREKA, Sept. 15.-A recent ruling of
the General Land Office, which, if not re
versed, will practically withdraw all
Government timber land from entry, has
caused great excitement and alarm here
among timber, locators and applicants
and dealers in timber lands.
The department at Washington has giv
i-n a new interpretation to the word
"speculation" in the timber and stone
act cf 1S78 end holds that any one who
takes up a piece of timber land expecting
at any future time to sell it at a profit is
a. speculator within the meaning of the
a.c" and not qualified to purchase. The
only persons who are permitted to pur
chase under the new ruling are those who
will swear they have land in the vicinity
of the timber land sought to be bought
from the Government and that they desire
the timber for personal use. A rancher
who is *o far removed from a mill or
lumber yard that he cannot buy sawed
lumber is the only person who can con
scientiously swear that he needs the tim
ber for personal use. If an applicant
swears that he will manufacture the tim
ber into lumber, expecting to make profit
out of the sale of the lumber, it is held
ihat his purpose is speculation and he is
excluded from the benelits of the timber
and stone act.
The new ruling is not only being applied
to entries upon which final proof has not
yet been made, but over KW patents in
this district alone are now held up in
Washington because the applicants, rely
ing on the decisions of the United States
courts, have stated in their final proofs
that at tome future time they might sell
their claims at a profit, or in other words
receive fcr them more than 52 DO per acre,
th# Government price.
LOANS MAY BE LOST.
Husiness men in the community are also
greatly interested in the ruling, though
;hcy have not lileO on claims. Many of
ihern have loaned large sums of money
to persons riling to supply the purchase
price of $400 for each claim. They have
taken mortgages on the land for security.
If patents are refused their security will
be gone and the Government will appro
priate the money. This is felt to be un
just, for it has always been held to be
an entryman's right to mortgage or sell
his claim after proving up so long as
there was nothing- fraudulent in the
transaction. The Government has in its
vaults $200,000 secured from citizens of
Humbcldt County for land which it now
refuses to patent. Over $200,000 in addition
will be paid to the receivers of this land
district for other timber lands within the
next few months-
Srectal Dispatch to The Call.
.Large Sums of Money Loaned to the
Enterprising Owners of Govern
ment Claims Now May
Never Be Repaid.
Why are parties stationed In every district
land office in the United States every day to
take a list of all the filings and provings on
each and every tract involved? Why are they
paying locators and others to get contests up
to test claims and furnishing the necessary
funds to do It? How is it that in many of the
large firms where timber lands are pledged and
hypothecated as security that reports are fur
nished from the land offices every day as to
what has been done? Under whose instruc
tions Is this done, and why Is It that no com
plaint is heard? Or why is it that inspectors
and others do not inspect? Why is It that ln-
Bpectors and special agents 6pend more time In
matters not conducive to good health or good
morals than investigating thp actual facts as
they arise? And they still aro the trusted rep
resentatives of the Government. What is the
reason for it?
Did It not become imperative on the part of
the scrip holders to buy and own parties who.
could assist them in securing lands, and Is not
the contemplated act of the next Congress tlie
reason why the scrip holders are fighting to get
all the land possible? Has not /some seventy
five thousand acres of land been gobbled up in
the Kureka Land Office district In the past
month? Will not one hundred and twenty-five
thousand acres more be gobbled up this month
and is not the effort made to throw out or tie
up each and every claim that can be possibly
upset by hook or crook? It has been truly
stated that no patents are issuing. Why? That
Is the question, and the one who can answer
thin has the key to the situation.
Is it not a fact that this ruling was made for
the exclusive use and benefit of the combination
who own and control the scrip Issued by the
Government?
Is not all the scrip owned and controlled by a
few wealthy concerns, and are not the banks
the depositors of scrip in question? Can you
not find scrip In banks adjacent to every local
land office sent by banks In Chicago, St. Louis,
San Francisco and other large cities? All this
Is perfectly legitimate unless used for collusive
and corrupt purposes.
Every applicant is compelled to answer
these questions on cross-exxamination.
The special agent who is active In holding
up claims in this district is a son of Con
gressman Wade of the Springfield, Mis
souri, district and a protege of Secretary
of the Interior Hitchcock.
The Evening Herald charges the ruling
was made in the interest of the scrip
syndicate,, in the following language:
SYNDICATE ON A GRIDDLE.
Do you Intend to cut the timber on the land
yourself or do you expect to have someone else
cut It, or do you intend to tell the timber?
At the time you made your application for
this timber claim was it your intention to
make use of the timber or stone on the claim
yourself or did you merely intend to purchase
the land for the purpose of selling it again for
a higher price?
Is the land so situated that considering your
occupation, circumstances and conditions in
life, you can make use of the timber and stone
on the land yourself, so as to make it possi
ble or practicable for you to use It for your
own exclusive use and benefit?
Do you own any real estate In the vicinity
of your claim or in this State, and if so, state
where?
Have you any personal use for the timber
or stone on the land?
Whv do vou purchase this tract of land?
How long do you expect to keep the land?
Do you expect to sell the land or the timber
thereon at a profit?
In another part of the letter is the fol
lowing:
"I desire to state that the department
has held large numbers of entries for sus
pension where it was shown in the testi
mony 'that he had no personal use for
either thp land or the timber and that he
exnects to sell the same at a profit,' which
will show you that an entry made for the
purpose of taking the land with a view to
selling it is purely speculation."
The new policy is shown in the follow
ing additional questions now being asked
applicants by special agents:
What do you expect to do with the land and
the timber thereon after you acquire title?
SPECULATION SUSPICIONS.
Office in the timber and stone case feported
on in tbe Susanvtlle, Cal.. land office by epe
cial Agent High, and acted on by such com
missioners as above stated. -.deciding that an
entry must -'not for the sole use of the claim
ant lent for the purpose of selling the tim
ber or land at a profit. Is speculation, should
bf- KuJficlent notice to you, as well as any other
M>.<ial agent that where the testimony jhows
that *uch is the intent of the applicant, said
special agent should report iuch entry for sus
pension or cancellation."
It Is clearly aurarent thjt where a timber
1 entry Is made for the purpose of making profit
out of the same, without the applicant having
any use for thÂ« timber, and that tt Is the pur
pose and Intent of such applicant to sell the
timber, or land in the future, that such an
entry is not made for the benefit of the appli
i cant lent for Xha benefit of anothed party, who
expeeta to use and utilize the timber on the
land- and no entry of that kind is made in
good faith, but without doubt for speculation,
j and it is f - held by the department. ,

It was decided to appoint a committee
to wage a campaign until the time of
the bond issue election, the committee
to be named by the chair, and its mem
bers to collect funds and send literature
to every voter in the city, requesting sup
port for the entire bond issue.
The name selected for the organization
is the Civic Federation of San Francisco
and its next meeting will be at the call
of the chairman. Thirty-three improve
ment clubs and civic organizations were
represented last evening by the following
named:
Those who took part in the discussion
were Mayor Schmitz, M. J. Keller. N. B.
Greensfelder, Walter Macarthur. Miss
Catherine Hittell, F. C. Selfridge, George
Alpers, John B. Bren, H. Mulcrevy,
George Renner, Rev. Father Wyman, W.
M. Weil, lsidor Gutte and Mrs. C. Till
man.
Representatives of the various Improve
ment clubs and civic organizations held
a conference last evening in the Super
visors' chamber in the City Hall to take
steps to indorse the bond issue for public
improvements on which tbe citizens will
vote on September 29.
Mayor Schmitz called the meeting to
order and M. J. Keiler was elected chair
man, C. F. Jones being selected as sec
retary.
While some of the speakers were In fa
vor of only certain of the improvements
for which bonds are to be voted on, the
general opinion was that the entire bond
issue should be supported. All the speak
ers were unanimous in declaring for a
bond issue for a new city hospital,
schools and sewer system. Others
thought that while these improvements
were needed as soon as possible, new
parks and a public library might be class
ed as luxuries and their establishment
could be postponed for a time.
The position of the department on the
question is clearly shown by the following
extract from a letter from the special
agent at Roseburg having charge of Cali
fornia and Oregon to Special Agent M. A.
O'Conor:
It is the duty of a epeclal airent of the Gen
eral Land Office to follow strictly the actions
of the department, and the decisions of the
honorable Com mi p? loners of the General Land
The first person who has been made to
feel the consequences of the ruling is
Mrs. Eunice J. Seidell of Arcata, Cal. She
proved up on her timber claim on August
29. She swore that she took the land for
her own exclusive use and benefit and
would nay for it with the money she had
received from her father as a Christmas
present last year. Her proof was a good
one and no taint of fraud could be sus
pected. Special Agent Wade cross-exam
ined her and won from her the admission
that =he had no present use for the land
or for the timber growing on it. She ad
mitted she would sell itvsome nme in the
future if she could do so to her own pro
fit. This. Special Agent Wade held to be
a speculative entry, contrary to law, and
asked that it be held up. It was done and
the proofs were sent to Washington ask
ing for a ruling or decision on the points
raised. When the ruling comes the local
officers must be governed by it, whether
it deprives the entryman of the benefits
given him by the timber and stone act or
not. until the courts decide what "specu
lation" means as used in the actâ whether
the Interpretation that has governed for
twenty-five years or the new interpreta
tion is the correct one.
WOMAN AND THE LAW.
That is the plain, flat oath every per
pon has taken but it was never before
held by th<? Ge'neral Land Office that the
words "exclusive use and benefit" could
be construed to mean that a person could
not reap the benefit of his claim by at
some future time selling it at a profit.
By the new construction an entryman
woul.5 have to Hi the timber in his own
building operations, or else build a saw
mill and cut it into lumber, and then by
a strict construction he would be pre- ;
vented from selling the lumber.
The General Land-Offlce. however, has
formulated no rule to prevent the s?crip
per from placing his script on this same
land withdrawn from the individual pur
chaser of ICO acres, but allows the scrip
per to make from 200 to COO per cent on
his purchase. The people are asking
themselves what is the motive of thp de
partment. If the new rule is upheld by
the courts within a few months every
acre of the Government timber lands will
be appropriated by wealthy lumber firms
and script holders generally.
The first intimation that the local office
had of a change in policy by the General
Land Office came to Special Agent M. A.
O'Conor from the special agent at Rose
burg. Oregon, who has charge of Oregon
and California. The change was so ab
surd to O'Conor and so radical that he
did not question with severity along the
lines indicated in the new, instructions,
and applied for further information. He
was summarily dismissed and no reasons
were given for dismissal. His work in
other Tesnects is known to have been ex
cellent and his dismissal was caused by
the fact that he could not swallow the
new policy. His place was given to Spe
cial Agent Wade, who is carrying out the
department's wishes in every detail.
TROUBLE FOR ENTRYMEN.
and the r.ew rule being reversed. Secre
tary of the Interior Hitchcock's new rule
will be tested at once in the United States
courts. It practically, repeals an act of
Congress, and it is argued cannot stand
a judicial test.
The timber and stone act has been in
effect for the- last twenty-five years and
the Government has parted with many
millions of acres of land under its pro
visions. In all cases the entryman has
sworn "that I do not apply to purchase
the land above described on speculation,
but in good faith to appropriate it to my
own exclusive use and benefit, and that
I have not directly or indirectly made
any agreement or contract in any way
or "manner with any person or persons
whatsoever by which the title I may ac
quire from the United States may inure
in whole or in part to the benefit of any
person except myself."
SUISUN. Sept. 13.-Under Sheriff Tom
Grennan, Deputy Sheriff T. J. Lenahan,
Constable Charles Downing. Town Mar
shal L. J. Chrisler and District Attorney
Tom Gregory of Suisun, accompanied by
four peace officers from Benicia, went to
Dintons Landing yesterday afternoon and
arrested John Tlllas, G. Dinnelli. Philip
Louis, Chris Varillo. Annie Varillo and
Jake Uncoil as accessories to .the mur
der of Fred Potter by George Pensacola.
The officers arrived here with the pris
oners early this morning and this after
noon the latter were arraigned before
Justice A. F. Hitchcock and each put un
der bonds of J200. Sworn statements were
taken from each of them, but no addi
tional light was thrown on the crime.
VALLEJO, Sept. 15.â As he walked off
a steamer here this evening Mlchaelo
Cornelius was arrested by Chief of Po
lice Stanford and Deputy Sheriff Line
ham. George Pensacola. who was caught
in Westminster. B. C, Monday by Sher
iff Keys of this county, says that Cor
nelius was the chief instigator of the
murder of Fred Potter, who was stabbed
to death and thrown into Suisun Bay
several weeks ago. 1 he officers have been
in quest of Cornelius for several days.
"I have not seen him for several months
and I have no idea what has become of
him. I do not know where he was stop
ping, nor anything at all about him. He
was always rather erratic and queer, and
he may have committed suicide for all I
know. No, he never threatened his life
In my presence, but then he Is liable to do
most anything."
Mrs. Miller on Sunday made diligent In
quiry in San Francisco among Venter's
friends and office associates, but none of
them could give any trace or clew to his
whereabouts. In view of his letter to
Marcuse they fear that he has carried
out his threats. Late Saturday night, on
the last trip of the ferry-boat Oakland to
San Francisco, a man either accidentally
or Intentionally fell overboard from the
upper deck. Passengers had noticed him
acting queerly before he went over the
rail. A boat was lowered but no trace of
him was found. Venter was an adjuster
for the express company. He was 4C years
old, but appeared many years older, be
ing bent and haggard.
Peter Venter of Oroville, a brother of
the missing man, is at the Golden West
Hotel in this city, where he is ill. When
seen last night Venter said that he knew
nothing at all about his brother, and in
sinuated that be cared much less. He
said:
According to Mrs. Miller, Venter had
been moody for more than a year. He
had proposed marriage to her more than
a year ago and procured the license. Mrs.
Miller says her reason for postponing the
event was because she believed Venter
was not mentally sound. About the time
of his proposal, she said, he took a
broomstick one day and struck one of her
children on the head, threatening to kill
it. A .moment afterward he became clear
and had apparently no recollection of his
act.
Many circumstances of the case add to
the mystery, though Venter Is said to be
a peculiar man.
Mrs. L. E. Miller, with whom Venter
has been boarding for three years at
Golden Gate and who says she was his
Intended wife, has notified the .police that
Venter has acted strangely for a year,
and she fears he has taken his life.
Venter sent a letter on Friday to J. H.
Marcuse, proprietor of the Auzerals cigar
store, southwest corner Ellis and Powell
streets, San Francisco, saying that he
would never again be seen alive. That
day Venter wrote to his superiors in the^
express company's ofiico that he was
at home sick. He was seen last at Golden
Gate Friday evening by a Southern Pa
cific Company flagman, of whom he in
quired the way to Berkeley. He acted so
strangely that attention was called to his
conduct.
J. C. Venter, for 25 years Jn the employ
of Wells Farffo & Company's express
office, this city, has disappeared from his
homeâ 5SG7 Marshall street, Golden Gateâ
and from his office in San Francisco.

was over a heavy track, which is not his

WESTERN horsemen are of the

Uncle's collection also went a little In
their half of the first. Keefe was wild
and passed Lynch and Meany, the first
two* men up. Irwln tried to sacrifice, but
he forced Lynch at third. Then Leahy
clouted the ball Into left field and Meany
arrived. Pabst walked, Krug got a life on
Sheehan's error and the bags were filled.
While they remained so Mr. Delmaa wag
thoughtful enough to tear off a two-cush
ion Swipe that sent everybody home. It
might have been even more runs had not
"Del" been caught trying to go to third
on the hit. After this inning the home
gathering had no trouble in alighting on
the shoots of Keefe and his own wildnesa
did the rest." The score:
" San Francisco â I SacramentCM-
at the Oakland lot. The home team had
.them going in every inning and it did not
require much energy or a whole lot of
ginger to make Mike ' Fisher's followers
look like a bunch of selling platers.
Score: San Francisco 9, Sacramento 4.
Although the game abounded in runs
and long hits, it was fast and consumed
but an hour and twenty minutes. Most
of the fielding was clean and the players'
did not waste any valuable time in mak
ing useless talks to the umpire, though
there were instances where they might
have yelled.
Uncle brought forth his newly acquired
shortstop, "Teeley" Raymond, the lad
with the auburn locks who has been
bushing it in the up-country leagues for
a few months past. The lad was played
at short and he did well. He took three
out of his four chances, and then. Just to
show the fans he was there, he cracked
out a long three-bagger to the right field
fence in the eighth inning.
' The Senators began to start something
in the first inning. After two were gone
McLaughlin smashed out a hit past third.
He then stole nicely and Eagan scored
him with a drive to center. Eagan also
pilfered second and he likewise arrived on
another hit by Townsend. Tommy Shee
han kept up the walloping and succeeded
in bringing Truck over the plate with an
other timely bingle.
Uncle Henry, with that made-over base
ball team of hla, was fast enough to hand
it out to the Senators yesterday afternoon

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 15 â
The first football Une-up of the season oc
curred yesterday afternoon, when Coach
Lanagan pitted two freshmen elevens
against one another. Only a few minutes'
scrimmage work was allowed, but It was
sufficient to show the rooters on the
bleachers that they may look forward to
supporting a good first-year football team.
To-morrow- afternoon the freshmen will
meet the Palo Alto High School eleven in
the first game of the season, and a lively
contest may be anticipated. The baby
class numbers some of the most promis

men who lined up yesterday afternoon
were G. E. Dole. Weller, Stott. Kellogg.

CHICAGO. Sept. 15.â Don Domo, the
"gray streak," from J. V. Newman's sta
ble, met defeat In the Test stakes at the
opening of Hawthorne to-day, the race
going to Copperfield, for which J. B. Res
pess recently paid JSOOO and which, it was
believed, was a "gold brick." Don Domo
was always favorite at 3 to 2. Instead of
going to the front and setting his field
dizzy with speed, Ferrell evidently had
waiting ordfrra and Alllsta was allowed to
set all the early pace, with Don Domo
second under double wraps. Turning for
home, Don Domo passed Allista and ap
peared to be winning, but he could not
stall off Copperfleld's rush and lost the
verdict by a neck.
The track was almost a river of soft
mud, over which fairly good time was
made. The weather was clear and boil
ing hot and the attendance good. Sum

Special Diepatch to The Call
The fight started with a rush and early
gave the Impression It would not last
many rounds. . McVey forced the pace
from the beginning: and kept Denver Ed
stepping lively. Martin was the first to
lead, using a left hook, which McVey
cleverly got under. McVey missed two
attempts with his right hand for the jaw
and took a straljtht left from Martin on
the- face. This was the only clean blovr
Martin landed. McVey forced Martin to
the ropes and at close quarters sent in a
powerful short-arm jolt over the heart,
Blmllar to the one with which Jeffries
ended the recent championship battle at
San Francisco. Martin unwisely attempt
ed to mix it with McVey and got another
right-arm jolt In the stomach. He slipped
to his knees, but was up Immediately and
after McVey. t ;
McVey met him. avoiding his straight
left for the face and sending in two right
hand body blows in qutck succession.
They were at such close quarters that as
Martin fell forward he clasped his arms
about McVev's shoulders. McVey shook
him loose and Martin went down, rolled
over on his face and lay perfectly still.
He was counted out. but did not get up.
His seconds climbed through the ropes
and administered the usual remedies in
the case of a knockout. After about a
minute Martin was lifted up and placed
In hla chair in his corner. As usual in
cases of a quick knockout there were
cries of "Fake" from some of Ihe specta
tors. From an impartial view point it
appeared Martin had been severely pun
ished, and while he might have made
some attempt to regain his feet he re
allzed he was a defeated man and to
have made another stand would only
have momentarily postponed the end.
Time of fight two minutes and thirty
seven seconds.
LOS ANGELES. Sept. 15.-Sam McVey,
the big colored boxer from Oxnard, made
short work of Denver Ed Martin to-night
at Hazard's pavilion. Martin wad knocked
out In thÂ«^ first round. Three short-arm
right handed blows, delivered at close
quarters, landed in the region of Martins
Â¦olar plexus and the colored man. who
was once a leader in his class, went dowft
on his faca and was counted out.
The football games preliminary to thÂ»
annual Intercollegiate match between
Stanford and Berkeley on November H
will be unusually interesting this year.
Manager "Pete" Smith of the Reliance
team Is building up a powerful eleven for
the trial games. He had twenty-three
men out for practice last night at tho
San Francisco Riding Academy, on Pa
cific avenue. In other seasons he has
found It difficult to get a sufficient num
ber of men out, and his team bad but lit
tle actual football practice.
It is possible the college teams will each
play one game on the other's campus b<"
fore the big game. This would give the
students an opportunity to compare the
elevens and secure a line on their relative
strength.
Among the players who will Â¦wear thÂ«
Reliance uniform this year will be Atkin
son, who has captained the team for sev
eral years, lie will play fullback. Cava
naugh. who weighs 260 pounds a*, present,
will play center. He played thla position
on the University of Chicago team In 1S3S.
The Fame year he was named for substi
tute center on the All-American team.
Smock, who played center for the Uni
versity of Illinois in 19*30, will play guard.
Holt of the University of Willamette or
Evans will play quarter. Wooldridge, a
halfback, has played on the Vanderbilt
University and .the University of Texas
elevens. Gelsler of Stanford and Mueller
of Purdue are also halfbacks. Graham,
who played fullback for Santa Clara last
year, is in the Une-up. Mc<Â«ilvray. a Stan
ford man, is expected to appear for prac
tice next week. Among the other candi
dates for gridiron honors are Magee of
Stanford. Gaffey of last year's Reliance
team. McDonough of Berkeley, Kenneth
Hamilton, Lewitt, St. John. Thomas.
Martin, Erwin, Beckett, Ooshen, Fleck
and Ray Falk.

GRAVESEND RACETRACK, N. Y-.
Sept. 13. â There was only one stake on
the programme to-day, and it Is very
doubtful if the best horse won when
Frank Farrclls King Pepper passed the
jiost slightly in advance of Irene L.ind
f!,;-, with Mamie Worth third. The name
of the stake was the liayshore. with sell
ing allowances, worth J1H95 to the win
ner. A large field of fast racer? went to
ihe post. Boon after they were sent away
Irene Lindsay and Mamie Worth drew
out from the others. After passing- the
half-mile pole Mamie Worth, ridden by
Hicks, suddenly fell back, causing ob
herver* to claim that she was shut off
by Irene Lindsay. Even though Mamie
Worth's jockey was compelled to pull her
up almost to a standstill, the filly was
not out of it, as she came on after the
pacemakers, Irene Lindsay and King
lVpper, and was beaten only by a small
margin. Summary:

the Department of Electricity that he
does not find any direct authority for the

for the Supervisors to authorize such ap
pointments by an "affirmative vote of
fourteen members of the board after the

the necessity for such appointments. The
opinion is the result of the desire of the

ployes at increased salaries under the
heads of cashier, clerk, stenographer,
etc.

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 13.â The execu
tive comrriittee of the State Anti-Debris
Association to-day refused to grant an
application made by representatives of
Eastern capitalists to work the Blue Point
mine In Tuba County. The mine, which
is owned by Patrick Campbell, is now
rlcsed under an injunction. It is desired
to work the mine by a new process and
to install some new machinery, but be
fore doing so a certain slide of gravel,
amounting to about 800,000 cubic yards,
muÂ«rt be removed by the sluice process,
and the petitioners sought to get the
consent of the association to its removal
so that the parties removing it would not
he in contempt of court.

barriers now being constructed by the
Federal and State governments near Da-
Ruerre Point, on the Yuba River, and for
which work the Federal and State gov

Heavy Fine for Hammil.
Judge Seawell in the opinion handed
down with the decision did not go into the
merits of the bootblack's contention that
the board's refusal to issue him a permit
and the Tax Collector's refusal to issue a
license were invalid acts. He simply held
that because Gheggeri had no license he
could not afford him relief, If these of
ficers improperly refused to grant the
plaintiff a permit or license, says the
court, his remedy would be a suit for a
writ of mandate compelling them, to do so.
The application of Giovanni Gheggeri
for an injunction preventing the Board of
Public Works from removing his boot
black stand, at the southwest corner of
Pine and Kearny streets, was denied by
Judge Seawell yesterday. Gheggeri had
no license to maintain the stand, having
been refused one by the Tax Collector,
and the court held that because of this
the Board of Public Works was acting
clearly within its rights in ordering the
removal of the stand.
Judge Seawell Refuses to Issue an
Injunction Restraining Board

Leopold Juzix, a stevedore employed in
unloading the steamer Uarda, lying at
Broadway pier No. 2, was struck and in
stantly killed yesterday afternoon by a
falling iron hatch beam, weighing about
700 pounds, and J. Green, a fellow laborer,
sustained a fractured skull, which may
prove fatal.
The accident occurred about 4:30 p. m.
as a 'quantity of saltpeter was being
hoisted out of the hold. The two men
were working in the hold of the vessel,
directly under the middle hatch, and as
the load ascended it came in contact with
the massive iron beam and dislodged it
from the grooves In which it rested.
"Without warning, the ponderous weight
fell into the hold through the open hatch,
striking Juzix and breaking his back.
Green was struck on the head and mirac
ulously escaped instant death. Willing
hands tenderly conveyed the two bleeding
forms to the deck, but upon examination
Juzix was found to be dead. Green was
conveyed to the Central Emergency Hos
pital, where he now lies In a precarious
condition.
Juzix was unmarried and resided at
22S>Â£ Bighth street. An investigation will
be necessary to determine the responsi
bility for the accident.

PERSONAL MENTION.
OAKLAND, Sept. 15.â The Rev.
Father Thomas McSweeney, pas
tor of St. Francis de Sales Church
of this city, addressed the Men's
League at the First Congrega
tional Church, corner of Twelfth anC Clay
streets, to-night on the "Pope and the
Cardinals in the Vatican, Rome." The
occasion was the regular quarterly meet
ing and banquet of the league. The as
sembly room was well crowded with an
appreciative audience. v,
In introducing Father McSweeney, Pres
ident Warren Olney Jr. of the league said
that there had always been a feeling ?f
pympathy and' respect between the va
rious sects' and that Father McSweeney,
regardless of the difference in. religion,
had graciously agreed to come and give
them a. talk.
Father McSweeney in brief said:
I will tell you something of the cardinals and
the Pope. During the second and third cen
turies, when Christianity in Rome increased,
branches of the church were formed in various
parts of the city. These were known as par
ishes and were the dwelling; places of some
Christians. There are seventy cardinals in the
Roman College and every one bears a title.
This title is taken from some original parisn
of Rome. Each cardinal descends from som*
parish and is known as the cardinal of that
parish. The cardinals are men from all over
the earth, men of known worth, of honor, for
they are the men from whom the Pope's suc
cessor Is chosen.
The, Pope never leaves the \atican. Toil
may ask why. Ever after Victor Emmanuel,
with his troops, entered Rome, Pius IX stayed
in the Vatican. For twenty-six years Pope
Leo XIII. never stepped out of the Vatican.
The Popes do not reoognlze the presence of the
KinB They look upon him as a usurper â as
bMng on the throne unjustly. That is why
the Pore stays within the walls of the Vatican.
He knows that he has a throne in the hearts
of his three hundred million people. His word
is their law. and they look to him for guidance
in their faith and morals.
One of the most remarkable men of this age
was Pot>e Leo. He waÂ» a wonderful man, a
man with a biz heart, a remarkable disposi
tion His one desire was that the men of all
nations should live in peace, harmony and hap
piness. Our present Pope, Pius X. is alao a
Brand character and well fitted to rule his vtst
religious army.
Father J cSweeney closed with a short
talk on the Catholic view of education.
The $6oO,OQO estate of David R. Jones,
the pioneer lumberman, who died a few
days ago, was disposed of by the de
ceased in a will made by him just one
month prior to his death. .The document
was filed for probate yesterday. Accord
ing to its terms Beatrice Jones and Ma
bel Dodge, grandchildren of the deceased,
are each to receive $75,000 and the resi
due of the estate is to go to C. C. Bemis,
executor of the will, in trust for John R.
Jones, Lillle Butterfield and Anne B.
Cookson, children of the deceased. They
are to share equally the income of tlie
trust and in the event of their deaths
it is to go to their children.
Jones' estate consists of the lot on
which is erected the building occupied by
Hale Bros., a house and lot on Army
street, realty in Homer's Addition, a
promissory note for $12,000 and $05,000 in
cash.
Beatrice Jones and Mabel Dodge Re
membered in the Will of David
R. Jones, the Lumberman.
He bequeaths all his jewelry except a

two-Sixths to his uncle, Judd Fairchild;
?nd one-sixth to his father. Elbert D.
Ruckman. He appoints George V. My

Arimmimi complained to the police and
on Monday he pointed out Greenberg and
Metzger as the two men who had tricked
him. They were arrested and yesterday
Arimmimi swore to the complaint against
them.
Joseph Greenberg. a "spieler" for a
pawnshop on Kearny street, near Clay,
and Leon Metzger, employed in the same
capacity for a shooting gallery under the
New Western Hotel, were booked at the
City Prison yesterday on a charge of pet
ty larceny by trick and device. The
complaining witness against them is Isi
dore Arimmimi, a visitor from San Luis
Obtspo.
Arimmimi alleges that he met Green
berg on Washington street a week ago.
Greenberg told him that his father owned
Llchtensteln'a pownshop and if he wanted
to buy anything it could be got cheap.
Greenberg took the stranger to China
town and, it 13 alleged, borrowed $5 from
him. Then he took him to the shooting
gallery under the New Western. wherÂ»
Metzger Joined them and wanted to know
if Gresnberg was willing to pay $10 for <*.
ring he produced. Greenberg said he
would only give $7 50 and he induced thÂ«
stranger to buy it. Experts say the ring
is worth 25 cent3.

CHICAGO, Sept. 15.â Between 3000 and
4000 persons passed through Chicago to
day on their way to seek homes in Okla
homa, Indian Territory. Texas. Louisiana,
California and other States. The move
ment was the largest of its kind ever re
corded in a single day in the history of
Western railroads. The occasion was the
first day of the homeseekers' rates to the
West and Southwest, the rate to Califor
nia and return being $33 and the rates to
other States considerably less than one
fare for the round trip.

Still believing that he has the right to
work, Oakes says he Is obeying the law
by^Jwearing his protector in full view of
any one interested enough In him to ob
serve the weapon.
Chairman Davis' query has been re
ferred to the City Attorney for an opin
ion.
Oakes had been the tarket for a fusillade
of rocks and vile epithets. Believing that
he had a right to work, he decided to as
sert himself and he accepted an invita
tion from Jhe crowd to come down the
pole. While he was descending Oakes
drew a loaded revolver from his pocket
and served hotiee that he would kill the
first man that molested him. On the
ground in the midst of the crowd he
backed himself against a wall and with
revolver pointed into the yelling and hoot
ing gathering sternly held his place. Some
of the disturbers found a policeman, who
arrested Oakes for carrying a concealed
weapon. He was technically guilty and
was fined S10.
The spectacle of a telephone company
lineman going about his everyday work
with a serviceable pistol hanging to a
strap belt outside of his garments, in
plain and suggestive view, has aroused
the ire of the telephone company's strik
ing linemen.
Edward Davis, chairman of the strikers'
grievance committee, has gone before the
Mayor to ascertain whether this armed
workman is not violating the law touch
ing the carrying of concealed weapons
when he openly exposes the revolver so
conspicuously.
Investigation disclosed that the employe
about whom the inquiry was directed was
W. Oakes, a lineman, who had been ar
rested two weeks ago and fined after he
had drawn a pistol upon a crowd of sixty
or seventy men that had gathered In
force at the foot of a telephone pole upon
which he was working.

If we cannot eet the alarms straight the
fire-ftghtins facilities of the city will be handi
capped and rendered far from efficient.
The estimate prepared by Mr. Babcock
places the cost of the improvements at
$14,500. Even if the recommendations are
allowed at once it will be several months
before the new apparatus can be com
pleted and the storage batteries installed.
Owing to the chemical action of the salt
breezes blowing inland the wires corrode and
become useless very quickly. Copper wires are
being substituted on West Seventh street. In
the up-town districts where the bay winds do
not strike to forcibly because of their more
sheltered position, the wires last longer, but
they will eventually have to be replaced with
copper, which more effectually withstands the
effects of the elements.
The City Electrician has this to say re
garding the matter:
SALT AIR CORRODES WIRE.
Many of the old lines of iron wire are
little better than streaks of rust, and
they are continually breaking and caus
ing trouble, and as they will soon have to
be replaced Mr. Babcock wishes to sub
stitute copper for the iron wire now in
use.
The CHy Electrician has prepared an
estimate of the cost of a number of
changes nectssary for the betterment oi
the fire alarm system, among which is the
substitution of storage batteries for the
bluestone gravity cells now in use. If
this change is made it will result in an
annual saving to the city of $S00. To re
lieve the present overload on the wires
running into headquarters it will be nec
essary to install a new Gamewell switch
board of twelve boxes and twelve striking
circuits to take the place of the board of
ten box and eight striking circuits now in
use.
CHANGES NECESSARY.
City Electrician Babcock spent the day
trying to locate the source of the trouble.
He has not yet been able to make an esti
mate of the damage, but it will probably
amount, to more than JCOOO, as it will be
necessary to install an entirely new set
vt fuse boxes, as well as to repair the
damage done to the relays, gongs and ca
bles. â¢
The fire alarm system and the police
telephones were seriously impaired to-day
as the result of a live wire somewhere in
East Oakland crossing with one of the
fire alarm wires at 4 o'clock this morning,
and burning out nearly every fuse in the
entire systems.
The current thrown into the fire alarm
wire? must have been heavy, as it jumped
the protecting fuses at the houses of En
gines 4 and 6 and burned out the gongs
and cables and put two relays out of busi
ness at the headquarters on Fifteenth
street. The police te!ephone system re
ceived its ehare of the "juice" and a large
number of the boxes are out of order, ne
cessitating the use of the public telephone
service by the officers. ...

Sentence was then pronounced against
him in accordance with the verdict
brought in by the jury which convicted
him, fixing his punishment at life impris
onment. He was then remanded into the
care of the Sheriff and later taken to San
Quentin.
"If that is all," replied the Judge, "all
that I can say is that I do not believe
a word of your story, but 1 do not wish
to discuss It." i
Victor Walkirez was sentenced to-day
by Judge John Ellsworth to serve fhe
remainder of his natural life in San Quen
tin prison for the murder of aged Eliza
beth l>eroy, whom he killed on May 4.
As soon as his sentence had been pro
nounced Walkirez. was taken to the Coun
ty Jail, where he packed his few belong
ings and. in the care of Jailer Harry
Clark, took the first train that would con
nect with the stage for the prison.
The ceremonies attending the sentencing
of "Walkirez were short and there was
nothing to mark the proceedings as un
usual other, perhaps, than the crowded
state of the corridors leading to the court
room and the room itself. Jurors wait
ing to be called in other departments and
others gathered to see the final act neces
sary to make the legal proceedings com
plete.
Walkirez showed little nervousness, and
when Judge Ellsworth asked him if there
was any reason why the sentence of court
should not be pronounced against him
he said: "I don't remember having done
what they say 1 did and 1 don't believe
1 did it."

They declare that however beautiful
Rock Ridcre Park might be much of its
attractiveness is spoiled because of the
proximity of Mountain View and St.
Mary's cemeteries.
On the other hand the Rock Ridge con
tingent claim that the Syndicate proposi
tion involves a saving of many thousands
of dollars to the club in purchase of lands
and is amply large for all the purposes
for which the exclusive organization haa
been formed.
Whether the recently organized Clare
mont Country Club, rival in outdoor
sports to Burllnsame, shall stand by the
original plan of establishing Itself at
Claremont on the lands owned by E4son
F. Adams or shift its headquarters to
the 100 odd acres northwest of Mountain
View Cemetery, known as Rock lUi'.ga
Park and owned by the Realty Syndicate,
is the question that has caused a wide
rent in the hitherto harmonious prelimi
naries of organization.
The board of directors has called a
meeting for Thursday night for considera
tion of the Realty Syndicate's proposi
tion, as advanced by Frank CL Havens,
manager of that corporation. Meantime
the partisans of the original project and
the friends of the Adamses on the di
rectorate and the followers of the Haven*
ayndicate proposition are lining up for
the fray.
At this point in the controversy which
has apparently taken first place In thÂ«
club's affairs neither the Adams nor the
Havens factions have determined Just
what Is their strength. Those who still
favor the Claremont site justify their ar
guments by pointing out its superb nat
ural attractions and its accessibility from
street car lines soon to be constructed.

LARKSPUR, Sept. 15.â The people of
Larkspur, and particularly Attorney Rob
ert D. Duke of San Francisco, who has
a summer heme here, are complaining
about their town water supply. Lark
spur Is supplied with water from creeks
in the adjacent canyons and the Ameri
can Land and Title Company of San
Francisco owns the appurtenances and
furnishes consumers.
Owing to the poor quality of the water
many of the consumers have recently
been compelled to either have it shut off,
use filters or purchase enough for house
hold purposes from neighboring wells.
Mr. Wright, the local representative of
the corporation, gives as a reason that
the poor quality of water is due to the
inadequate supply occasioned by the lack
of water in the streams. At. any rate,
Mr. Duke has brought suit against the
company and asks the courts to award
him heavy daraaces.

Captain James Brown of the treasure
hunting schooner Hermann was brought
before United States Commissioner Hea
cock yesterday morning for identification
as the person charged with having as
saulted on the high seas R. Karashino,
the steward of the schooner. Ball was
set at $2500. Brown's counsel applied for
a reduction of bail, and Juu.se Heacock
Baid he would pass on the application to
day and would probably grant the re
quest. The Japanese was not present, and
it was stated that he would not appear
to prosecute.
Captain Brown Identified.
If thtrc Is a sufficient supply of wrter
to nccomodate the needs of several regi
m--'i)*s, San Diego wili be selected a.i the
render cus. Officers at Fort Rosecran.s
will be ordered to make a thorough in
spection of the ground, and to make a re
port to the department commander. This
will be done immediately and if the re
sults are satisfactory Getferal MacAr
thur will make the necessary recommen
dations to the War Department.
The general â¢ then proceeded to* Fort
Rosecrans, San Diego, and inspected the
troops and the fortiScatlons at that'point.
He found everything in satisfactory
Bhape, but expressed some disappoint
ment that the work of constructing new
quarters for the troops was not progress
ing more rapidly.
The party was entertained at Los An
geles by General Harrison Gray Otis and
Major Norton of the Chamber of Com
merce. On Monday General MacArthur
visited Sargent's, a short distance from
Gilroy. and inspected the target practice
of the batteries of light artillery.
The most important feature of the trip,
however, was the unexpected discovery of
an ideal camp near San Diego for the
temporary location of large bodies of
troops. General MacArthur has been
searching anxiously for a place where the
projected maneuvers of the combined
department and .National Guard forces
might be held. Near San Diego he foun-i
a great Ftr^tch of country not under cul
tivation and well adarted for the great
war game which is planned.
Major General MacArthur returned yes
terday from an official inspection of mili
tary stations in the southern part of the
State and from a short pleasure trip to
Arizona. He was accompanied on his
journey by Mrs. MacArthur, Lieutenant
MacArthur and Captain Parker W. West.

the charts. The plane of reference Is tbe mean
of tbe lower low waters.
The publication in the Recorder of the
calendar of Judge Kerrigan's court was
the first inkling had by the attorneys for
the heirs that proceedings were being
taken. From information received from
McNutt they knew of the wilt and under
stood that no action would be taken by
him until It was filed, or at least until
the arrival in this city of Mrs. Strohn.
When the case came up for hearing Mon
day ex-Judge- C. W. Slack, Â¦who repre
sents Mr3. Strohn. and M. M. Michael,
attorney for Mrs. Hart and Mrs. Carter,
the other sisters of the deceased, ap
peared and opposed the petition. Judge
Kerrigan, scenting vigorous opposition.
Instead of complying with the wishes of
the McNutts, promptly acknowledged
that he had made an error in assigning
the case to himself and reassigned it to
Judge Coffey. "I did not Know there was
any opposition to the petition," he said,
"otherwise I would not have assigned it
outside of the two departments wherein
probate matters are heard."
McNutt has thirty days In which to file
Miss Clark's will and until that is done it
is not probable that any further action
-will be taken.
PETITION 'IS OPPOSED.
The estate of Miss Clark has been the
cause of considerable speculation since
her death. This is due to the tactics of
the McNutts, father and son, since her
death. It 'began when young McNutt,
acting as his father's attorney, petitioned
the court for the appointment of Dr.
McNutt as special administration of the
$500,000 estate of the deceased. He ap
plied to Judge Kerrigan for the appoint
ment, informing him that Miss Clark had
left a will bequeathing most of her es
tate to her sister, Mrs. Roys N. Strohn,
and naming his father as executor.
Judge Kerrigan, who believed the matter
to bo simply a formality and ignorant
of* the fact that there were other heirs,
assigned the case to his own court and
set it . for hearing Monday afternoon.
This happened Friday at noon and the
petition was not filed until Saturday
evening, five minutes before the closing
of the County Clerk's office, and only
after Probate Clerk Casey had Informed
the Judge that the proceedings were en
tirely irregular. The petition should have
been tiled before being taken up to the i
Judge for assignment, or Immediately
afterward, as there are fees to be paid
and assignments to be entered.
ACTION OF McNUTTS.
The determined opposition to the ef
forts of Dr. W. F. McNutt to obtain spe
cial letters of administration upon the
estate of the late Isabella D. Clark, the
wealthy woman who committed suicide
at hia hospital, on the 9th had It3
effect yesterday. The petition for spe
cial letters filed by McNutt several days
after the woman's death was withdrawn.
The withdrawal waa made by Attorney
Maxwell McNutt, son of the petitioner,
in Judge Coffey's court when the matter
was called for hearing- He made no ef
fort to explain his action, but simply In
formed the court that he wished to with
draw the petition. Consent to do so was
readily granted, and the case was strick
en from the calendar.
Military Â¦ Affairs in South

ULAR RUN BY THE EKD OF THIS MONTH.
City Attorney Lane Is looking up the
Ir.w as to whether the higher valuation
si plies to the city's tax rate, and he will
probably give an opinion as to whether
the Board of Supervisors has the power
to so reduce the rate as to prevent the
ocessive collection of Jl,250,0G3, based ca
the raise by the Board of Equalization.
I conclude from these provisions that the
r.oard of Supervisors must in June determine
the amount of money to be raised for mu
ii-<-il<al purposes. This has been done. The
tate could not be determined till after thÂ«
Ftate Board of Equalization had met and fixed
the valuation. If T.e must construe the above
la:i?ruag* of the charter as compelling the
Uoard cf tfupervitors to fix the rate in June
each a provision would be In conflict with
cenc-rai law ar.d void. But I do not think it
nectEsary to so construe the lanruage of the
ffcurter. The Board of Supervisors complies
r-jth the charter when they fix the amount
of money to be raised. That amount can
nc< be lncr^ayd by any action of the State
licar.J of Equalization. I conclude that such
a rate must now be fixed by the Supervisors
Â«* wii: collect the amount cf money hereto
fore determined uion. and no more. A higher
rate on the Increased valuation *h!ch would
raise more money than was determined neces
sary would. !n my opinion, be unlawful. You
should wait till the Supervisors act.
MAY FIX TAX BATE NOW.
You ask lor my crininn regardingr the In
<â¢< > r d \a!uatlon recently placed upon the
property of this city and county by the State
liuard of Equalization and its application to
municipal taxes. That the 'ooard had the right
to inor^sif? the valuation is shown by section
â¢>. article 13, o* th<? constitution. That there
can be but cne valuation for both and
municipal purpoyes was decided in the case of

f.Â»iÂ« ojierate in connection with our chaiter

Baehr is of the opinion that the Super
visors hnve the power to reduce the rate.
<>: rather to fix the rate, next Monday,
according: ty State law. He holds that
the- charter requiring the rate to be fixed
in June conflicts with the State law and
is therefore unconstitutional, and he is
borne out in this opinion by that of his
attorney, which follows:
ONE VALUATION ONLY.
Auditor Baehr himself believes that thl3
*vould be the logical way out of the diffi
culty, as he is firmly of the opinion that
the higher valuation only should be car
ried out on the assessment roll. In order
to collect only the amount to be raised
from taxation, exclusive of revenue from
oiher sources, the Board of Supervisors
would have to reduce the original rate of
HXC53 on a valuation of J422,OO0,O00 on the
$30i> assessed valuation. This could be done
on the third Monday in September, as the
State law requires. The rate of 82.72 cents
could then be calculated on the higher

;zalionâI54Â».C Â«â¢/Â«)â and thus thr additional
tax collections not contemplated by the
municipal budRft need not be raised.
Auditor Baehr received an opinion yes
i> rday from his legal adviser, William H.
Colib, to the effect that there should be
1'Ut one valuation for State and city taxes

with Northwestern connection. Armour and
local shorts, bought. Receipts were fair, but
offerings became limited and the market soon
reacted. December going to 83 Vic. At that
price there was profit taking on a large scale
and a part of the advance was lost, the close
showing Decertber back to 82%!fi)%c, a gain
of Vtc. Trading was active and on a large
scale.

the whole traders appeared to be holding off
until conditions can be more accurately judged.
December closed at 51*4c. a loss of %c.

WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Are about as prevl- 1

tions. The chartered wheat fleet in port has a
registered tonnage of 51.700. against 52.000 tons

400 tons, against Â»H).000: on the way to this
port. 207,000 tons, against 227.C50.
WHEAT â The foreign markets showed little
change. Chicago reported the export demand
poor, but the domestic demand good, and ad
vanced in sympathy with a sharp rise In the
Northwestern markets. The weather In the
Northwest, continued very bad, excessive rain*
having flooded the harvest fields. Europe
wants wheat, but Is evidently getting It else
where.
This market has ehown no change of any
consequence for several weeks. The feeling Is
rather easy for cash grain, except on milling
account, while futures rule firm.

; NEW YORK. Sept. 15. â Extensive short â¢ell
' ing not unmixed witri some liquidation was the
feature of the day's stock market, particularly
during the early session. Much of the selling
was based on '.unfavorable crop reports. While
the market movement was governed largely by
this factor, others almost as depressing exerted
no Inconsiderable influence. London advices re
ported that the Macedonian situation had as
fumed a graver 'aspect and this, together with
the probable crisis in the British Cabinet bring
ing increased weakness to consols, all made for
lower price*. A further hardening of discounts
in London and Paris was _ reported, though
Paris exchange oh" London was easier. For all
that London lÂ»;urtt perhaps 5000 shares on bal
ance, chiefly AtcKlson. Southern Pacific and
Erie. It Is quite probable that' all of these
transactions were of the arbitrage sort.
The local market opened with rather more
than the recent amount of activity, giving
promise or a bui-:y day. A rally soon followed
under the lead of Atchison. Other features of
strength at this time were St. Paul and Read
ing. A number of inactive issues. Including
General Electric, National Biscuit and Carolina
Chemical, were traded In moderately at all de
clines. The Steel stocks held barely steady,
| and the Ftreet was inclined to take a pessimie
i tic view of the call issued by the syndicate to
carry out the bond conversion. The heaviness
! of Amalgamated Copr<er reflected a drcp in Rio
I Tint'ss abroad. The market continued compara
| tively narrow and irregular, but in the late
| trading prices moved up and there was consld
j eraMe s,hort covering. A decline of 314 per
I cent In the Sttc-1 5 per cent bonds was In etrik
t Ing contrast to the material improvement made
I in the final trading by the grain carrying roads
, also by Union Paciflc and Southern Pacific.
Private advices indicating that early reports as
to crop damages had been somewhat exagger
j ated were largely responsible for the compara
1 tive strength of the market at the close. The
Erie statement of the quarter ending June 30
I was Ifsued. showing an increase In net earnings
I of more than $1,500,000 and a surplus increase
1 of $2.10,000. An increase of $222,000 in net
I earnings for the year was shown by the Chi-
I cago. Indianapolis and Louisville road

COMMERCIAL NEWS
Continued From Page Eleven.
M. Batelli of Geneva, by combining mas
sage with electrization, has revived dead
dogs and kept them alive for as much as
twenty-four hours.
The new concern has selected as Its
point of shipment Los Medanos, the
Hooper Company's property In Mendocino
County, covering 100 acres and contiguous
to both the Southern Pacific Company
and the Santa Fe lines as projected into
the redwood country. The site has 2C00
feet of deep water frontage. â¢
Here will be assembled many millions
of feet of redwood, a stock sufficient to
meet all demands, and here will the lum
ber be handled for shipping as the orders
are given.
The projectors of this Important move
in the lumber field look upon it as the
solution for the hitherto unsettled con
dition of the trade touching the constant
calls from the East for redwood that
could not be satisfactorily met because.
It is explained, no individual pro
ducer had the necessary supply to meet
the demands of Eastern consumers.
Plans of the new company contemplate
the establishment of the headquarters at
Los Medanos at once, that progress may
be rapid toward the accumulation of
stocks. As rapidly as the mills produca
the yards will be furnished, and it is
expected that long before the new rail
road lines into the lumber region of Men
docino and Humboldt counties shall have
been completed the new supply com
pany will be ready for extensive opera
tions. From the lumber men's point of
View this organization is considered one
of the best projects of the day. They
have been watching the growing interest
of the East In redwood with no little
interest and concern, realizing that the
ability to handle the business was. to
say the least, extremely confined. For
some time the plans for the combination
that culminated yesterday have been
under serious discussion, and those
concerned are more than satisfied wltn
the ituation. By uniting their Interests,
their combined efTorts. they are satis
fied, will give the trade a tremendous im
petus abroad.
An organiration of redwood lumber
merchants and manufacturers of Califor
nia, representing millions of capital and
composed of the heaviest mill and ship
ping corporations in the lumber trade,
was'perfected yesterday at the headquar
ters of the Mendocino Lumber Company.
40 California street, for the purpose of
handling for the Eastern market the
enormous demand for redwood lumber
that is coming from that portion of the
United States landward of California, the
home Â«f the famous sequoia and semper
virens. S>>VvE
At this meeting yesterday organization
of a company with a capital of $1,000,000
was effected, in which all of the stock
has been subscribed by eight or ten of
the largest producers of redwood lumber
In the State. Among those corporations
that have entered into the new concern
for the purpose of facilitating the East
ern trade are the Hammond Lumber
Company, the Pacific Lumber Company,
the Union Lumber Company, the Charles
Nelson Lumber Company and the C. A.
Hooper Lumber Company.
The Mendelssohn overture to the "Mid
summer Night's Dream," gracefully ren
dered, felicitously opened the. programme.
A notable delicacy was achieved in the
handling of the gossamer beauties that
abound in the overture. Mr. Scheel . was
quite Italian in his enthusiasm in the
"William Tell" overture that closed the
afternoon in a highly spirited fashion.
But the chief applause of the day was
reserved for the Grosso Concerto of Han
del, that Mr. Scheel graciously repeated
from the last concert. It was doubly
charming on its second seasonable hear
ing and roused a quite unsymphonic sort
of noise among the again fine audience.
Next week the fifth symphony of that
"very good little man. Papa Haydn" â as
Mr. Scheel calls himâ will be given, with
the Beethoven "Coriolanus" overture, and
as chief novelty a "Serenade" by Rich
ard Strauss, for two flutes, two oboes,
two clarionets, four horns, two bassoons
and one contra bass.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Another feature of prominent interest
on the programme was the "Parsifal*
excerpt, "The Bells and March of the
Knights of the Holy Grail." Its fascinat
ing phrase is the last thing that stays in
the ear, and found such welcome yester
day that it had to be repeated. The
movement has all the wealth of orchestral
color, the dramatic value, that one has
come to associate^ with "Wagner's name,
and its appearance at this stage of the
"Parsifal" controversy was peculiarly
apropos.
Fritz Scheel with a Brahms symphony
before him is Fritz Scheel his most.
Yesterday afternoon's symphony concert
so showed him and also found his men In
their ever finer fettle.
Giving Brahms symphonies is not the
easily graceful task of lilting: a "New
World" symphony, nor of echoing the fa
miliar majesty of an "Eroica." He who
preaches here the gospel of Brahms Is
still as a voice crying In the wilderness.
Nor are we in worse case than was Phil
adelphia ! before the conductor so lately
undertook its conversion to the Brahms
creed. There he haa hammered in the
doctrine in the face of opposition and in
difference until the place is now known
as the stronghold of the faith in America,
with Scheel as its defender. Nor would
it have been Scheel had he neglected to
preach the gospel of the greatest modern
symphonist while he was here. All of the
four symphonies were given by the con
ductor during his sojourn among us, and
yesterday afternoon's was only another
pioneer effort at our proselyting.
The hardly more than courteous ap
plause that greeted the particular sym
phony of yesterday (D major) shows thai
there is still much proselyting in tITe
Brahms cause to be done. The local ap
preciation of the composer Is surely juster
and more generous than when Mr. Scheel
was here last, but it is still far from the
Philadelphian standard. Can't be other
wise with Brahms almost a dead letter
orchestrally here, and the symphony or
chestra itself usually almost deader. But
these concerts give one again the ready
hope, evoked first by Maestro Mascagni
last spring. That the local material can
do what Mr. Scheel made it do with
Brahms yesterday and the local audience
give such deeply respectful, even, if not
yet affectionate attention to the com
poser, is surely ground for modest confi
dence in our future. For it needs brains
as well as heart to get at Brahms, and
you begin with the brains. To Scheel,
who has thus preferred to add to the
gray ions under our cranlums, instead of
luring the easy hand by tickling an ac
cvfstomed, ear, much gratitude should be
going.
And, oh, the harmonic wealth, melodic
grace, fertile fancy that Brahms has here
for us in the D major symphony! His
thematic fecundity reminds of Beethoven,
his fluent polyphony of Bach. Of these,
his true artistic ancestry, he has inherited
the noblest 'traits, and to them added a
lofty charm all his own. It is pure music,
offspring of a spirit that never descended
to compromise with the day's cheap
nesses, that never for a moment consent
ed to lower its exalted standard. Austere
of approach it become sweetly genial on
acquaintance, but everywhere of superb
dignity and Individuality.
The first movement of the D major lets
one right into the heart of the Brahms
realm. And well, Indeed, Mr. Scheel led
his men over its rhythmic hurdles and
thematic jungles, its massive movement
swinging Instantly into the right ele
phantine stride. The adagio was also
nobly done, its fine countours cleanly
drawn, its varied tints most sympatheti
cally felt. There was youth and delight
ful gayety in the handling of the charm-
Ing "grazloso," and the finale, with its
insistent, chiming phrase, varied with su
perb skill, went also to the tune of com
plete triumph for the conductor.

A legal wrangle was participated in be
tween the attorneys for the prosecution
and the defense, in which Judge Cabaniss
was umpire. The attorneys for the ac
cused women took advantage of every
technical opportunity to file objections to
questions propounded by the prosecuting
attorneys and by Judge Cabaniss. Most
of the objections were overruled.
The witness then testified that on some
date in August, between the 19th and 21st.
Mrs. Sutton came to the drus store and
presented a prescription reading, "Arse
nic. McLaughlin, M. D."
"Did you converse with Mrs. Sutton?"
was asked of the witness by the prose
cuting attorney.
"I did." was the reply. "I asked her
who wrote the prescription, and she said
Dr. McLaushlln had. I afkod her what
the arsenic was to be used for, and she
said she did not know. I then asked her
what quantity of arsenic^-^vaa required,
as no quantity was mentioned on the
prescription, and she again replied that
she did not know. .She said any quantity
would do_ and I gave her an onnce of
arsenic. I did so with trie distinct under
standing that she was to give the arsenic
to Dr. McLaushlin."
LAWYEB DBUBY SCORES POINT.
Attorney Drury, for the defense, put
the witness through a rigid examination.
He took advantage of every opportunity
to prove that the 'witness did not pos
sess sufficient memory to connect Mrs.
Sutton with the person who presented the
forged prescription.
Under the questions plied by Attorney
Drury, the drug clerk admitted that he
was unable to say how Mrs. Sutton was
dressed at the time she presented the
prescription. He could not remember If
she had her hat on or oft or if it was in
the morning or evening when she visited
the drujr store.
"You cannot remember these important
matters," said Attorney Drury, â¢'yet you
claim to be positive in your identification
of Mrs. Sutton, whom you say you had
never seen before she presented that pre
scription."
The witness assented to the propounded
question, and then admitted that he had
identified Mrs. Sutton as the woman who
visited the drug store when he saw her
at the office of Chief of Police Wittman
two days after the death of Bowers.
In the examination of the drug clerk
Attorney Drury scored a victory over the
prosecution, for *he brought nut the state
ment of the witness that from his own
memory he could not remember the exact
date when Mrs. Sutton Is alleged to have
presented the forged prescription for the
arsenic.
Detective Thomas L.. Ryan testified that
he located the forged prescription at the
drug store at Fifth and Folsom streets
on the night of August 27, two days after
Bowers died.
The further hearing of evidence was
The witness did not have his file of the
drug store prescriptions with him. and
while he knew that- the forged prescrip
tion had been filled on a certain date,
owing to the dated number upon it, the
defense would not allow him to testify
by that meai*?. They insisted that he
testify as to the date the prescription was
filled, relying 1 solely on his memory, and
the drug clerk under these conditions was
unable to fix the exact date.
Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Hanley
showed the witness the forged prescrip
tion and asked him if he recognized it
"I do," was the ready response of the
witness.
DRUG CLERK CAUSES WRANGLE.
When the drug clerk testified that Mrs.
Sutton had presented the forged prescrip
tion calllnc for arsenic and Yixed the
time as being between the 19th and 21st
of August last, the attorneys for the de
fense piled one objection after the other
before the court.
J. C. Peterson, the drug clerk at the
store of J. Askenasy, at Fifth and Fol
som streets, was then called to the wit
ness stand.
to die at any time, but the witness posi
tively denied that she had made any sug
gestion. She stated that on the day be
fore Bowers died Mrs. Sutton had re
quested her to accompany her and Mrs.
Sutton had purchased the mourning dress
for her sister.

Removal Notice.
"Mrs. Martha Bowers," said the wit
ness, "told O'Leary to go to her house
and make the bed and clean the lamps
and that she desired him to stay at the
house with her."
Attorney Drury. for the defense, sought
to elicit from the witness that she had
suggested to Mrs. Martha Bowers and
to Mrs. Sutton that it would be as well
for Mrs. Martha Bowers to buy a mourn
ing dress, as Martin Bowers was "likely
The sister-in-law of the deceased then
testified that after Bowers died at the
German Hospital she accompanied Mrs.
Martha Bowers to the residence of Mrs.
Sutton, who ~was informed that Bowers
was dead. Mrs. Sutton then asked Mrs.
Martha Bowers to try on her mourning
dress and the accused woman did so.
From the residence of Mrs. Sufton the
witness had gone with Mrs. Martha Bow
ers to a saloon on Taylor street, where
the accused woman had called on Wil
liam .O'Leary and informed him of her
husband's death.
Strong links in *he chain of evidence
against Mrs. Martha E. Bowers and her
sister, Mrs. Zylpha C. Sutton, charged
with the murder of the former's husband,
Martin L. were presented yes
terday in the hearing of testimony before
Police Judge Cabaniss.
Positive proof was produced that the
death of Bowers was due to arsenic, and
the principal witness of the day. Drug
Clerk J. C. Peterson, furnished the evi
dence showing that Mrs. Sutton presented
a forged prescription to him and obtained
an ounce of arsenic some days previous
to the death o' Bowers.
The attorneys for the defense made an
effort to exclude the evidence of Peterson
and their objections were presented with
rapidity. Every question asked of Peter
eon by the prosecuting attorneys was
quickly objected to by the defense, but
Judge Cabaniss was tirm and ruled that
the witness should be allowed to give his
evidence.
The accused women appeared in court
dressed in black and wore heavy seal
skin coats and black veils. The damag
ing testimony against them was listened
to without apparent emotion, and to all
intents the accused women might have
been ordinary spectators. * .
AUTOPSY SURGEON TESTIFIES.
Autopsy .Surgeon Bacigalupi was the;
first witness called yesterday, and he de
.tailed the holdinsr of. an autopsy on the ;
body of Martin L. Bowers oh August 26
last. The surgeon the condi-'
tion of the organs of the body and told
how he found the liver and kidneys
affected by fatty degeneration. He had
removed the stomach and a portion of
the brain for analytical examination by
Professors Green ana Morgan. The wit
ness identified his report of the autopsy,
which stated the cause of q\eath to be
due mainly to fatty degeneration of the
kidneys. . - â¢
The autopsy surgeon further testified
that the fatty degeneration of the kid
neys could have been caused -Â»y the ad
ministration -of-arsenic, -and- in -reply -to
a auestion by the defense said that the
same conditions might arise from other
causes.
Mrs. Harry Bowerr, sister-in-law of the
deceased man, was called to the witness
stand and testified that she visited Mar
tin L. Bowers from August 16 to the day
of his death at the German Hospital on
August 24.
She told of the weak condition of Bow
ers and how he suffered from constant
vomiting spells and was unable to move
his limbs. The witness further testified
that during the time she was at the resi
dence of her brother-in-law his medicine
was given to him by his wire, with the
exception of one occasion, when Mrs.
Martha Bowers asked the â¢witness to pive
the sick man one of the pills prescribed
by the doctor.

in the vicinity by the fumes from the
smokestacks of the works. Mr. Price has
been engaged as a witness for the Govern
ment in the trial of the suit of the Govern
ment against the Mountain Copper Com
pany (Limited), to enjoin it from further
destruction of vegetation there. He will
testify that certain improved machinery
has been introduced which will convert
the fumes into sulphuric acid, which will
be saved and utilized.
This improvement will cost from $60,
000 to $70,000. As the plant is valued â¢ at
several millions and as the sulphuric acid
will be a' profitable by-product Mr. Price
thinks that it will be economy to intro
duce the improvement. \The pending liti
gation has for its object the perpetual in
junction of the copper company from al
lowing the fumes of its works to escape.
The case will be on trial October 19.
Improved Machinery for This

ance with a decision of Acting Attorney
General Hoyt declaring that the subpena
served on the Postmaster General yes
terday to appear at the hearing in New
York to-day of the case of George W.
Beavers, the former head of the salary
and allowance department. Postofllee De
partment, was void, the Postmaster Gen
eral has designated Postoffice Inspector
Lawrence Letherman as his representa
tive at that hearinr.
Postmaster General Payne said to-day
that It was a physical imnosvibility to
comply with the subpena in any event,
aside from the law in the case. Jhe sub
pena, he pointed out, called for papers,
documents and records covering years
of operations of the department to be
produced before the United States com

use in connection with the investigation
of the poBtal service and are scattered
throughout the country in the hands of
inspectors.
The Grand Jury has been deliberating
over the case of a former Assistant At
torney General, who at one time was
prominent, and much evidence \ has been
submitted by postoffice inspectors and
others. This case is connected with that
of a former law clerk. Manager Bow
man of the Southern Mutual Investment
Association and others testified before the
Grand Jury in this case. It is expected^
that the Grand Jury will take early ac
tion on both cases. There are in the
neighborhood of half a dozers other in

ing. Hon. Rafael de Zayas Enriquez, the

tion at Mechanics' Pavilion, and they will

MEXICAN CONSUL. GENERAL,
WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN
THE CELEBRATION.
t'pon the request of counsel . the ar
raignment of McGIehan and Huntlngtoi
was adjourned until September 23.
The defense and prosecution offered U
submit memorandum on the point raisetf
giving the decision in support of each o!
their contentions, and the Commissionei
then adjourned the examination unti
September IS, at which time he will give
a decision on the point at issue.
After placing Officer George Russell on
the stand and having him testify in elab
orate detail to charts of the scene of the
assault in the Marriott house. Attorney
Dunne called Police Sergeant Lionel
Shaw. Shaw testified that he called at
the Marriott house a few minutes after
the shooting, and that at the time Mrs.
Marriott told him that five shots were
fired In all, that she was in the nursery
until three of the shots had been fired
and that it was a short man in gray
clothes and wearing a mustache who did
the shooting.
In the cross-examination Johnson suc
ceeded in making a somewhat sorry spec
tacle out of Shaw. He forced the witness
to admit that he never made a report of
Mrs. Marriott's statements to his supe
rior, and, in fact, never told any one about
them until questioned by Dunne during
the course of the criminal trial in Judge
Cook's court last December. Officer Jo
seph Lycette and Sergeant of Detectives
George McMahon, who were at the Mar
riott house on the night of the shooting,
repeated the same speech of Mrs. Marri
ott and were subjected to the same severe
cross-examination.
The hearing of witnesses for the defense
will continue this morning.
ment, under indictments returned against
him by the Federal Grand Jury of Brook
lyn, charging him with conspiracy to de
fraud the Government through complicity
with the Brandt-Dent Manufacturing
Company of Watertown, Wis.. was com
menced to-day before United States Com
missioner Hitchcock. The defendant was
represented by his counsel, Messrs. Mor
gan and Seabury, who were reinforced
by a third lawyer. Max Stauer, who con
ducted the examination. The defendant,
looking worried, though attempting to ap
pear at ease, sat behind his counsel.
At the beginning of the examination
Stauer moved to dismiss the proceedings
on the ground that the facts as alleged In
the complaint were insufficient and that
no proof had been presented for the Com
missioner's consideration in support of
the indictment and complaint, as re
quired by law.
Mrs. Marriott took the stand in the
morning to testify to her knowledge of
the assault upon her husband by Beale
and Williams. She maintained, as at the
former trials, that she rushed from the
nursery upstairs when she heard the
sound of scuffling in the hall below, and
that she was standing on the turn of the
stairs when her husband rushed past her
and Williams, at the newel post in the
hall below, :ired three shots at the fleeing
figure. When asked whether she had not
stated to Sergeants Shaw and McMahon
and Patrolman Lycette of the police
force and to Bernard Jeffrey Jr., and Fred
erick Bishop of The Call staff that she
was in the nursery when she heard three
shots fired and then rushed on the stair
way, where two more detonations fol
lowed, Mrs. Marriott made denial with
the strength of speech stated above.
Upon questioning his witness Attorney
Hiram Johnson sought to have her admit
that Detective Tcm Gibson repeatedly
sought her after the shooting, each time
with a different story, which would be
calculated to confuse and mislead her in
the presentation of testimony before the
courts and thus assist in clearing the de
fendants. Attorney Dunne immediately
objected strongly to Johnson's question
and the Judge' ruled it improper.
The brief testimony of Mrs. Mary E.
Bucknall, mother-in-law to the plaintiff,
clcsed the case for the plaintiff.
The early part of the afternoon was
given over to the arguments of the attor
neys upon the merits of the amended
amendment which Dunne had made to his
answer. After going over legal prece
dents the lawyers submitted the case to
the Judge and his Honor ruled in favor of
the defendants. The demurrer of the
plaintiff was overruled.
"I swear it by the love which I have
for my baby!" was the dramatic empha
sis which Mrs. Mary t Marriott put upon
one of her statements yesterday when she
was testifying in behalf of her husband,
Frederick Marriott, in the damage suit
against Truxtun Beale and Thomas Wil
liams before Judge Sloss. Her strong as
sertion upon the crucial point of her tes
timony did not seem to convince Attorney
Peter Dunne of the defense, for later he
produced three witnesses to contradict the
statement made by the wife of the editor.

BEAVEES IN COURT.
The names of Harry A. Seger, Henry
Nunez, Charles F. Boss and A. M. Mc-
Bath. inspectors and clerks in the Post
master Genc-rals office, are also affixed to
the warrant.
The warrant of arrest was issued in
Washington by Judge Harry M. Clabaugh
of the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia. Affixed to the document are
tlif* names of thf> Â¦witnesses upon whose
testimony the indictment is based. Among
them are D. S. Richardson. C. L. Way
land and C. F. H. Uirdseye.
Krwin was in a composed frame of
mind yesterday and felt sure of the im
mediate vindication of the charges pend
ing against him. He was deluged with
friendly messages from all parts of the
country and said he was overwhelmed by
the interest that his friends had manifest
ed in his welfare.
His attorney, Samuel Knight, is of the
opinion that possibly this step may not be
necessary.
What will follow is of course a matter
of conjecture. The accused is fully ready
to surrender himself to the demands cf
the Government and is prepared, if mces
*ary. to leave immediately for Washing
ton. I>. C.
It is further charged that Machen cor
ruptly passed as correct bills for said
devices at unreasonable and exorbitant
prices, and that the three indicted per
pons corruptiy divided the money so
obtained among: themselves.
It is charged also that on August 1, 1901,
S4S7O was collected for 520 time indicators
No. 1 at J4 2j each, and 4S0 No. ;: .it Ji ."0
each; that on December 1, 1301, they con
spired to purchase another 1003 for $416S 23,
being S73 of No. 1 at $4 each. ISO No. 2 at
$â¢ -j each and 2*>j No. 3 at 14 50 each, and
that on January 1, 1902. they conspired to
purchase 1000 more.
Krwin, in anticipation of the arrival of
the warrant, presented himself at the of
fice of the United States District Attorney
at 1 o'clock yesterday. lie was accom
panied by Willis G. Witter and Thomas
Rickard, who were prepared to act as his
bondsmen. As no sum was stipulated in
the document, a telegram was sent to
Washington for further advice.
Attorney Woodworth at once began to
prepare the removal papers and they will
be ready by 10 o'clock this morning, when
Erwin will present himself at the attor
ney's office to accept notification of ser
vice.
The indictment charges James W. Er
win, August W. Machen and George W.
Beavers with conspiracy to defraud the
United States, on July 13, 1901, by giving
to and obtaining for a Postal Device and
lmproveiat-nt Company, in a manner con
trary to law, the exclusive opportunity
for the business of furnishing to and for
the free delivery service certain articles,
tupplies and equipments at unreasonable
rnd exorbitant prices, and far above the
ordinary : cost of manufacturing and fur
nishing such articles, and at prices much
higher than the pricos at which those ar
ticles or their equivalent could have been
obtained if they were procured by honest
mtans and in a lawful manner. It is
charged that the company supplied 100 of
the time indicator devices, and the con
tpiracy was to be effected by Machen
oourary to his duties and the trust re
j'osed in him.
It is charged also that Machen neglect
ed to advertise for proposals, and so con
cealed the fact from the public that these
articles were to be purchased, and that
Machen knew that public exigency did
not require the immediate delivery of
those articles.
The warrant charging Postal Inspector
James W. Erwin with conspiracy to de
fraud the United States Government ar
rived yesterday at noon. Aradng the
principal names attached to the document
it that of D. S. Richardson, and It is ap

With St., N.Y. City, adds her tes-
timony to the hundreds of thou-
sands on Mrs. Pinkham's files.
When Lydia E. Pinkham's Reme-
dies were first introduced skeptics
all over the country frowned upon
their curative claims, but as year
after year has rolled by and the
little group of women who had been
cured by the new discovery has
since grown into a vast army of
hundreds of thousands, doubts and
skepticisms have been swept away
as by a mighty flood, until to-day
the great good that Lydia K.
Pink ham's Vegetable Compound
and her other medicines are doing
among the women of America is
attracting the attention of many of
our leading scientists, physicians
and thinking people.
Merit alone could win such fame j
wise, therefore, is the woman who
for a cure relies upon L.ydia E.
