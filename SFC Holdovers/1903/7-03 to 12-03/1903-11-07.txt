Importance of the concession to the . commercial and , polit
ical interests of. the United States cannot 'be overrated. The
route by t the Isthmus of Panama Is 'the shortest between the
two oceans, and from the Information "herewith communicat
ed It would seem . to be the most practicable \ for a railroad
or canal. Thft.Vast advantages to our commerce which would
result from such a communication, ' not only from* the west
coast of America,, but .with; Asia" and 'the islands of the Pa
cific, are too obvious to require any ; . details . Such a passage
will save us from a . long ' and " dangerous navigation of more

America comparatively easy .; and; speedy: .'The,; treaty does
not propose ' to ; guarantee ' a " treaty to a' foreign nation In
which the United ' States wlH have no common'; interest with
that nation. 'On the .-contrary, "we 'are more' deeply and di
rectly Jnteres'ted In the : subject 'of j the guarantee than - New
Granada herself or' any other'country.'
"These considerations, : the -\ controlling nature of which
were at onco recognized so long ago) have, become' more and
more Important in every. year, that has elapsed since the treaty
was . written.. Ouf*> acquisition of Hawaii "and the Philippines
has given them a greatly enhanced, validity. The control, in

"This; Is a right which we acquired by the treaty, not

Granada by the present' stipulation the perfect neutrality of
the before-mentioned isthmus - with ". the view that the- free
transit from the one to the other sea may not be Interrupt
ed or embarrassed â¢ in any future time while this treaty ex

matter is not only in the strictest accordance with
the principles of justice and equity and In line with all the best
precedents of our public policy, but it was the only course he
could have taken In compliance with out treaty rights and obli
gations. By our treaty, entered into with New Granada in
the year 1846, New Granada guaranteed that 'the right of
way or transit across the: Isthmus of Panama, upon any
modes of communication that now exist or that may be
hereafter constructed, shall be free : and open to the Gov

IT W Q ASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â The Secretary of State to-
U M jf day made the following statement in regard to af

Secretary of State Explains the Attitude
of the American Government.
"The right to this control we have never forfeited by any
laxity of our own, either in the assertion of our rights or In
the performance of our duty under the treaty. â¢ In 1S33 Mr.
Everett assured the Peruvian Minister that we should not
hesitate to maintain the neutrality of the isthmus in the case
of war between Peru and Colombia. In 1864 Colombia, which
has always "been vigilant to avail Itself of Its privilege con
ferred by the treaty, expressed Its expectation that in the
event of war between Peru and Spain the United States
would carry Into effect the guarantee of neutrality. .
"There have been few administrations of the State De
partment in which thi3 treaty has not by either one side or
the other been used as the basis of more or less Important
demands. It was said by Mr. Fish in 1871 that the Depart
ment of State had reason to believe that an attack upon Co
lombian sovereignty on ithe Isthmus had on several occasions
been averted by warning from this Government. In 1SS6,
when. Colombia was under the menace of hostilities from
Italy In the CerrutI case. Mr. Bayard , expressed the serious
concern that â¢ the , United States could not but feel that a
European power should resort to force against a sister re
public on this hemisphere, as to the sovereign and uninter
rupted .use of a. part of whose territory we are guarantors
under the solemn faith of a treaty. The United States has
not only constantly . protected Colombia from foreign
invasion on the" â¢trength of the rights and "duties cre
ated by the treaty of .1846, but has time and again Intervened
to preserve the freedom of traffic from disturbance in the
course of domestic dissensions. In these cases we have In
tervened sometimes at the suggestion of Colombia, some
times on ' our own* Impression of the necessities of the case,
but always to the profit of Colombia as well as universal
commerce. The position of the United States was clearly set
forth by Mr. Seward in' these words:
UNCLE SAM WILL BE NEUTRAL.
. " 'The United States have taken and will take no inter
est In any question" of internal revolution In the State of
Panama or any State of the United States of Colombia, but
will maintain a: perfect neutrality in regard to such domestic
controversies. - The United States will, nevertheless, hold
'themselves ready to protect the transit trade across the isth
mus against "invasion- of either domestic or foreign disturbers
of the peace of j'the. State of Panama.'
"There has never been any doubt' of the validity of the
treaty of 1846 to guarantee free and open transit either for
American citizens or for the Government of the United States.
We have used the Isthmus for the transit of troops and of
fugitives - from justice, and a protocol was signed at Bogota
on the 22d of February, 1879, acknowledging this right of
transit for. troops . and extradited fugitives belonging to the
United States, a right as- is declared in the' protocol, 'which
is established in compensation for the guarantee of the sov

WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.-Convicted by
court-martial of having hazed underclass
men at the Naval Academy, Midshipmen
Joseph Drummond Little of Ohio. John
Henry Lofland of Iowa and Worden Chaf
fee of Wisconsin were to-day ordered dis
missed from the service by Secretary
Moody. They will never be eligible for re
admission to the Naval Academy, al
though their offense was mild in its ef
fect on the "plebes" who were hazed.
Captain Brownaon, superintendent of.
the Naval Academy, who brought tha
record of the court-martial to the Navy
Department this afternoon, expects this
drastic action to have a signal effect in
exterminating hazing at the academy. Th<j
unusual part about thfs case is that the
midshipmen dismissed are all members of
the first or senior class, members of
which generally hold themselves aloof
from "running" underclassmen and whose
assistance In the preservation of disci
pline has been so great during the past
year that the anti-smoking rule was ab
rogated In their favor.
Â¦ It was evident that these seniors, how
ever, were unwilling that the academy
should be robbed of the traditional hazing
practices when the second and third
classes were both pledged not to annoy
"plebes."

CHICAGO, Nov. 6.â Goven, While in this
city, was connected with the Provision
Dealers' Dispatch Company and was also
private secretary to Henry Botsford, a
wealthy business man. He had the entire
confidence of his employers and large
sums of money passed through his hands.
He disappeared one day and an exam
ination of his accounts revealed a short
age of about 125,000.
Gradually running short of funds, Goven
still made a great attempt to keep up ap
pearances. He took a room* at the Hotel
Portland on the European plan. He paid
for It with his last few dollars. Then he
saw Plnkerton and decided to end it all
and face his former employers,
i Pinkerton did not know if the Botsford
Provision Company wished his arrest at
present but wired to find out.
Chief O'Neill of Chicago telegraphed the
Portland police to arrest C. C. Cloven on
a charge of embezzlement. So Detectives
Day and Weiner took the Chicago man
In charge yesterday afternoon. His at
tire was impeccable, his manner was ele
gant, but the man wanted for the embez
zlement of $25,000 had but a two-bit piece
in his pocket. When the question of a
route to Chicago was brought up Goven
at once requested that he go by way of
San Francisco that he might see his wife,
who is seriously 111. Ho will probably be
humored.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 6.â With only 25
cents in his pocket, Charles G. Goven,
who embezzled $25,000 from the Botsford
Provision Company of Chicago two years
ago, yesterday surrendered himself to
William A. Plnkerton, the well known de
tective. Pinkerton was a guest at the
Hotel Portland and Goven also was stay
ing at the house.
"I'm tired of wandering around. I'm
sick of this, and I am willing to go
back to Chicago," declared Goven. "I
just saw you sitting here and I said to
myself that the best thing I. could do
was to surrender to you. and tell you who
I was. I'm about out of money."
Since Goven left Chicago two years ago
he has been In almost every part of
North America. For a time he took part
In a revolution in Nicaragua. Then the
homesick feeling forced him back to the
neighborhood of Chicago. The fear .of
detection and arrest drove him westward
and his next stopping place was Butte,
Mont.

GANG OF ROBBERS
RENO, Nev., Nov. 6.â With her â¢ head
badly crushed Margaret Mlrot, a young
French resident of the half-world, was
found unconscious at an early hour this
morning and died at noon. Neighbors
heard her quarreling with some unknown
person last evening, but thought nothing
of it. When her room was visited about
2 o'clock this morning by one of them
sho was found on the bed, where she had
crawled after the murderous assault.
The weapon was a five-pound stone tied
up in a handkerchief.
The fact that she had tied a towel about
her head, instead of giving an alarm,
gives color to the theory that the crime
was comitted by some one whom she
wished to shield. â¢

NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â Sam Parks was
to-day sentenced to two years and three
months in Sing Sing Prison. . The sen
tence was passed on the charge of ex
torting $500 from the Tiffany Studios.
It was alleged that Parks as walking
delegate of the Housesmiths' and Bridge
men's Union forced the Tiffany Studios
to pay him $500 to call off a strike. This
was Parks' second sentence for extor
tion. He was released from Sing Sing on
certificate of reasonable doubt after his
first sentence. In imposing sentence to
day Judge Newburger said he took into
consideration the physical condition of
Parks, who is said by physicians to be
suffering from consumption in an ad
vanced stage.
Parks, whose customary air of defiance
has entirely deserted him, heard the sen
tence without a movement of feature or
outward suggestion of emotion.
Former District Attorney James W.
Osborne, Parks' counsel, said * that he
would in all probability appeal, but that
no certificate of reasonable doubt would
be' applied for.
Sam Parks was taken to Sing Sing
Prison this afternoon.

happened to her, and she telegraphed her
relatives In this city to meet her, which
they did. What the motive for the kid
naping was, the girl cannot tell.
According to the story told by Miss Cof
fin she was abducted while under a hyp

strangers. The woman, she says, met her
on the street in East Orange ,and exacted
a promise from. Miss Coffin that she
would meet her at a certain place in East
Orange. She could not resist the woman's
influence and kept the appointment.
Miss Coffin was met by a man, who
placed her in a carriage and took her to

Bishop Fowler predicted that the Mor
mons In a few years would have a de
ciding voice in the politics in Utah, Wyo
mnig, New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada,
and that the question would present a
phase more serious than did slavery half
a century aj;o.
"Conditions in Utah, with the probable
exception of Ogden, are most unsatisfac
tory," said the Bishop. "As far as I can
see, there are two factions Jo blame.
First, ourselves, as the committee of
church extension, and, second, the general
committee of the missionary society. The
pittance given Utah has been so small
that the superintendents have been com
pelled to pick up 'two by four' men to go
into that field."
Bishop Fowler's statement was brought
out during the discussion of the amount
of monev that should be authorized by
the Methodist church for the extension
of its work in Utah. He followed Bishop
Cranston, who said that the church had
practically failed in its work in Utah be
cause of the need of money.
The Dev. Dr. T. C. Iliff. now a field sec
retary, but for twenty-five years superin
tendent of the Utah mission, supported
Bishop Fowler's plea for liberal appro-;
priatlon, but resented the insinuation of
inefficiency of the workers In that field.
No change was made in last year's ap
propriation for Utah.
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 6.â During an ad
dress before the general committee of
church extension of the Methodist Episco
pal church to-day Bishop Fowler said
that the Methodist "church ought to pay
more attention to the extension of its
work in Utah and the Southwest, where
the Mormons have churches, and endeav
or to convert as many people as possible
to Methodism in order to offset the power
of the Mormon church.

Mr. Schwab was not reached as a wit
ness, Mr. Untermeyer spending the after
noon in examining Mr. Nixon about the
alleged false statements and misrepre
sentations to the public during the pre
liminaries to organization.
Mr. Untermeyer took up the direct ex
amination ot tho witness, asking first of
the agreement made between Nixon, Mr.
Dresser and Mr. Schwab for the purchase
pi the Bethlehem plant. Mr. Pam, Mr.
Nixon said, had charge of the negotia
tions thereafter, and Charles M. Schwab,
whose personal counsel Mr. Pam is, was
regarded as the_ dominant figure in the
negotiations. Mr. Pam prepared most of
the papers drawn up, a few being pre
pared by Mr. Alexander of Alexander &
Green.
Mr. Nixon declared that when the mort
gage covering the plants of the Ship
building Company outside of the Bethle
hem plant was drawn up at the time of
the organization, he had merely glanced
at it. but had not read it through care
fully, having confidence in the men who
prepared it and being without expert
knowledge of mortgage forms. The sec
ond mortgage, covering the Bethlehem
plant and as a second mortgage on the
other plants, was also merely glanced
through by him and ho had only a gen
eral knowledge of its provisions, knowing,
however, of the provision that the bonus
provided for by it should . have equal
voting power with the stock. The two
mortgages, he believed, were presented "to
him for execution, the first by Alexander
and the second by Mr. Pam.

PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 6. â Dissatisfied
members of The church of John Alexander
Dowle, the self-styled Elijah II," are
coming to Oregon to found a new com
munity. Seven former followers of the
"Prophet" were in Portland last week
seeking a location. They are men of
means, who expect to secure about 5000
acres of land and to bring from Zion
City, 111., about 150 families.
The creed of Dowie has been revised,
but not to the liking of all Zionists, and
there Is friction in the "City of the
Righteousness." The dissatisfied ones de
clare that Elijah has failed to make good
his promises, and they are through w.Hh
him and his rule. Here in the Northwest
they expect to establish . a new colony,
in which any good Christian may reside so
long as he observes the laws.of the place.
It is to be a new Zion, a reformation of
Dowieism. the following out of the orig
inal representations of Chicago's "Eman
cipator of the sinner slaves."
â¢Dowie knows nothing of the plans of
the colonists, say their representatives;
but on the other hand, they declare he
would be pleased to rid himself of his op
ponents, as he holds that all not for the
prophet are against him.
P. L. Rogers, a building contractor,
leads the party. With him were W. J.
McCann, John Loud, Charles Brown.
Alexander Reside, I. K. Miller and H. A.
Steek. They made money in Zion, but
being at outs with the leader of. the
church, they are practically ostracized,
as work is denied them.

SAM PARKS GOES
TO SING SING
"The decision of Judge Cleveland in
the Bennett will case is in rav favor on
all the moral questions raised by the heirs
and against me on the technical law
points only. The Judge finds that no un
due influence was exercised on Mr. Ben
nett and that no injustice was done ,to
the relatives. He holds, however, that
the letter to Mrs. Bennett cannot be pro
bated with the will, but, he expret-sly dis
claims any intention to decide whether o'r
not the twelfth section can hereafter be
held operative in establishing a trust; he
eays that .the (*onstructon of the will is
not in qu'es'tion at the time of the probate.
The court in effect declares that the be
quest would have been good If it had been
made direct, as Mr.'' Bennett suggested,
but that under the decision the latter
cannot be probated in the absence of
proof showing that it was actual'y in ex
istence at the moment when the will, was
executed. If the beo.uest fails it will not
be the fault of Mr. Bennett, but my fault,
and this point will be determined by the
higher court, although my attorneys have
not yet decided on what form the ques
tion will be raised. I am much better
pleased with the decision than I would
have been if the court had decided for me
on the legal point and against me on the
moral questions involved. His decision on
the question of undue Influence is full,
emphatic and all that could bnr desired.
It is a complete answer to all the
sinuations of the unfriendly papers.'
Judge Cleveland to-morrow win hear
motions from the attorneys for Mr. Bryan
and for Mrs. Bennett and the heirs upon
the form of the decree to be entered.
The motion for an appeal to t*e Superior
Court will then be made by Mr. Bryan 3
attorneys. 'They are In conference with
him to-night in regard to the nature of
their claim for an appeal.
Judge Cleveland, In rendering the opin
ion, said:
"I find that the question of whether the
will was properly executed was not
raised. ' I find that it was properly exe
cuted and I find that tho testator had
sufficient testamentary capacity.
"I find that there was no undue in
fluence by Mr. Bryaxi over Mr. Bennett.
It was claimed that the sealed letter I
should be incorporated In the will. I find !
that reference in the will was sufficient
as to the sealed letter, yet the language
In the document itsHf plalnlv Indicated
that the will was executed before that
letter was executed. There was in ex
istence before the will was executed a
duplicate of the sealed letter. That is
considered In support of the contention
that that paper was a part of the will.
The sealed letter was. found with the will.
I find that there was no undue Influence,
but that the soaled letter was net incor
porated in the will."
The court further said that he ex
pressed no opinion as to whether the
sealed letter which gives $50,000 to Mr.
Bryan and' his family can be incorporated
in the will.
"It may be urged," he continued, "that
it ran be used, but as to that the court
has no opinion to express."
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. Câ W. J.
Bryan reached this city late to-day from
Lincoln. Nebr., and at once went to the
offices of his attorneys, where he read
the decision in the Bennett will contest,
which Judge Cleveland handed down
earlier in the day. After Mr. Bryan had
conferred with his lawyers he made a
statement as follows:
SAYS HYPNOTIST
WAS A KIDNAPER
The visit of President Ripley of the
Santa Fe early this week Is excuse for a
renewal of the talk in connection with I
lhat company. There is now a generally
accepted belief that the Santa Fe inter
i f sts. which have fnr a year had survey
ing parties on the I'pper Gila In Eastern
Arizona, propose to run the main line of
their road from a point in New Mexico
through Clifton or that vicinity, down the
Gila River to its confluence with the San
Pedro, whrre it wiil join the Phoenix and
Eastern, now building, and which would
then.be taken oVer, bringing the Santa
Fe into Phoenix. From here it would run
via' thÂ«> present S. F., P. and P. tracks to
Congress, thence northwest over the des
ert country to the Colorado River, meet
ing th* 1 present main line at a point west
of Needles. That line if built would elimi
nate many excessive and expensive grades
now on its main line and probably would
not be longer than at present. That it
will be built sterns almost certain and
that it will be in the near future Is pre
dicted by well informed people. The capi
tal of Arizona will then be on the main
line of two transcontinental railroads.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 6.â The an
nouncement to-day that the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company had acquired full
ownership of the Maricopa, Phoenix
and Salt River Valley Railway has put
new enthusiasm into railroad affairs. The
Maricopa and Phoenix has always been a
Southern Pacific property to the extent
that that company owend 51 per cent of
it, but its operation was by an entirely
separate company, with headquarters here
and in San Francisco, the late N. C. Mas
ten, Francis Cutting and other California
men being prominent in its management.
P. I. Kendall is the secretary of the com
pany.
For years there has been talk of a rail
road from San Diego to Phoenix, pass
ing up the valleys of the Gila and Salt
rivers and through a rich section of agri
cultural land under the Buckeye irrigat
ing canal. It is believed here that the
taking over of the Maricopa and Phoenix
is the first step on the part of the South
ern Pacific in changing its main line
through Arizona, so as to have it pass
through Phoenix, leaving the present line
at Sentinel, passing up the Gila River to
Phoenix and thence to Tucson, or
some point this side of there, using a
part of the Maricopa and. Phoenix track
for that line. The main object, however,
would not be 'the securing of the short
piece of track, but the placing of Phoenix
on the main line; the development of the
Buckeye country and probably the influ
ence early building would have in keeping
out competition.
Secretary Kendall recently visited the
Buckeye country and it was rumored then
that his purpose was largely in connec
tion with thtse changes, though he would
not commit himself to any such state
ment.

SAX MATEO. Nov. 6.â The sensation of
the hour in San Mateo is the resignation
of W. B. Hamilton as private secretary
to Charles W. Clark and the further an
r.ouncement that before Jeavir.gr the prem
ises Hamilton had roundly thrashed Jo
peph Dyer, head coachman of the Clarks.
The two occurrences coming together
Â¦were supposed to be incidental, but it has
been learned that they were quite inde
pendent. From Intimate friends of Ham
ilten it is learned that he sent in his res
ignation more than a month ago, but it
took effect only yesterday.
When Dyer learned that Hamilton was
leaving it is said he mada himself ob
noxious in 6ome way and was promptly
punished. A doctor was called in and
Dj'er's Injuries were found to be triv
ial. The secretary was untouched. The
demands of his private affairs here and
In Montana are the reasons given for
Hamilton's resignation. He and Clark
went to San Francisco together to-day
and are on the best of terms. They have
been tocether for fourteen years and
Clark parts with Hamilton Â¦with great re
luctance. Hamilton is said to have
arawn a. salary of $o00 a month. It is said
that Hamilton's resentment to Dyer was
on account of the latters persistent mis
represenattions concerning Hamilton's
management of matters about the Clark
premises.
The other coachmen condemn Dyer and
: Ida with Hamilton. A story that Mre.
Â«iark gave preference to the .coachman
over the secretary when it came to an
alternative as to which should go is de
nied on all rides. Mr. and Mrs. Clark
leave for the East to-morrow. Mrs.

The Hurt home presents a sorry appear
ance. * The ground is charred and bar
ren, and Tieaps of ashes mark the spots
where some of the furnishings were sent
up in smoke. All the windows have been
smashed and suspended sheets cut out a

at a fever heat because of the doings of
the "rollers" a crowd of boys stoned the
building and broke the windows.
When asked how it would be possible
for him to distinguish "saved" persons
from curiosity seekers, he replied that the
leaders would receive word from Christ,
and if not, the candidate would not be
eligible. Continuing, he said: "We have
already established a church at the Hurt
home, and our membership will spread,
for we have the pure religion. It is the
old religion from the time when Christ
was on earth. Creffleld is an apostle, en
dowed with the power of the apostles of
Christ."
"We take the Bible in Its entirety,"'
said an apostle to-day, "and do not, like
othpr churches, admit a member because
he pays the membership fee. In order
to become a member of the church one
must be saved."

WWO C/UOtOT BE CURED.
So tmifonaly successful has Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription proven in all forms
cf Female Weakness, Prolapsus, or Falling
of Womb, aad Leucorrhea, th^, after over
a third of a century's experience in curing
the worst cases of these distressing: and
debilitating ailments, Dr. Pierce now feels
fully warranted In offering to pay $500 in
cash for any case of these diseases which
be carrot cure.
It Staitos Al/MffE.â The "Favorite Pre-
scription 1 ' stands alone, as the one and
Â°Â°lr rraedy for these distressingly com-
mon forms of weakness^ possessed of such
positrrely specific curative properties as to
warrant its makers in proposing, and
bmdiay themselves to forfeit, as we, the
cadersiffned proprietors of that wonderful
remedy hereby do, to pay the sum of $vx>
in legal money of the United States in any
case of the above diseases in which after a
fair aad reasonable trial of our treatment,
we fell to core. No other medicine for
the eyre of woman's peculiar ailment is
backed by 6uch a remarkable guarantee ;
no other medicine for woman's ills is pos-
sessed of the unparalleled curative prop-
erties that would warrant its manufacturers
in making such an ofier ; no other remedy
has such a record of cures on which to base
euch a remarkable oQer.
Therefore, insist on" having Dr.Pietce's
Favorite Prescription and turn your back
on any rnscrupulous dealer who would
lasolt your intelligence by attempting to
foist upon you some inferior substitute,
under the plea that Â«it is just as good."
Insist on having the article which has a
record of a third of a century of cures and
which is backed by those willing to forfeit
5500 if they cannot cure you.
In cases attended by a leucorrheal drain

should be used conjointly with the use of

THE HAGUE, Nov. 6.â Solicitor Gen
eral Finlay concluded his argument in be
half of Great Britain before the Venezue
lan arbitration tribunal to-day, arguing
that the war was entirely justified, that
all the documents showed that it was only
under the pressure of blockade that Vene
zuela consented to guarantee the block
ading powers 30 per cent of the customs
and that preferential treatment of the
claims of the powers which took part in
the blockade would in no wise prejudice
the rights of the other powers
"^ni HAGUE - Nov - 6-Messrs. Cohen
and Richards, for Great Britain, followed
Solicitor General Flndlay.
Mr. Cohen maintained that Venezuela,
having recognized the justice of the
claims of the blockading powers in the
protocol of February 13, which was the
basis of the present arbitration, could
not now plead that their claims were un
just. He said an annual distribution of
the 30 per cent of the customs would be
unfair to the allied powers, which had
incurred great military expense
Mr. Richards held that the negotiations
looking to raising the blockade having
been conducted between Venezuela and
the other blockading powers, the other
powers which took no part in the block
ade could not object to preference being
given to the former claims.
President Plerantonft followed in be
half of Italy. He upheld the right of the
powers to protect the interests of their
subjects in Venezuela.

CONSULS AT CEREMONY.
COLON. Colombia, Nov. 6.â Shortly
before the flag of the republic of
Panama was formally hoisted over
the prefecture here this morning the new
civil and military governor, Porforio
Melendez, delivered an oration. He said:
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â The Panama
Railway and Steamship Company and
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company have
received dispatches from Panama con
firming the reports of the evacuation of
Colon by the Colombian troops. The ad
vices received by the Panama Company
give additional particulars of how nar
rowly a conflict betv.-een the American
marines from the gunboat Nashville and
the Colombian troops under Colonel
Abajos was avoided.
According to the dispatch the marines
were landed in the morning and threw up
Intrenchments near the steamship pier.
They were further protected by freight
cars near the trenches. Some 400 Colom
bian troops were drawn . up near the
American lines and things looked threat
ening for the handful of Americans. Col
onel Abajos jumped out before his troops
and ordered them to advance on the
Americans. The Colombians had no de
sire to. Impale themselves on the bayo
nets of the marines and refused to ad
vance. They retreated and were fol
lowed by the fire-eating commander after
he had broken his sword across his knee.
Fifty American residents of Panama had
been armed in the meantime and the lieu
tenant in command of the marines sent
word to the Colombian camp that while
his men were there simply to protect
American property, they had no Intention
of dodging any trouble that might come
their way.

The last information is regarded by the
officials here as being most Important.
as showing no disposition on the' part of
the new republic of Panama to repu
diate the canal or other property rights
acquired from Colombia,
A few irresponsible newspaper critics
criticize the United States and show ig
norance of the French Government's po
sition by asserting that warships will be
pent to Panama "to restrain the Ameri
can plans." These views are not shared
by the Government or by the more seri
ous element of the press and public. The
official sentiment is distinctly sympa
thetic to the United States.
PARIS, Nov. 6.â M. Jusserand. the
French Embassador at Washington,
promptly communicated to Foreign Min
ister Delcasse the details of a conversa
tion he had with Secretary of State Hay
Thursday evening, in which the latter
gave assurance that if the United States
concluded a treaty with the republic of
Panama for the construction of the canal,
the French Panama Canal Company
would receive the $40,000,000 agreed upon
for the purchase of the French rights.
M. Delcasse's reply to the Embassador
has not been announced, but there is rea
son to believe that it was most cordial
and contained the assurance that France
will not do anything to hinder the recog
nition of the new republic.
The news of the recognition of the new
republic of Panama by the Government
of the United States arrived so late to
night that It was found impossible to ob
tain an authoritative official statement.
Indeed, the French Government has de
termined to formally announce its recog
nition of the republic of Panama, but it is
not likely any statement will be made re
garding its intentions. The tendency in
official quarters, however, is toward leav
ing: the United States untrammeled in its
attitude. If the Government of the new
republic should prove to be firmly estab
lished, able to maintain order and protect
the property interests of the French resi
dents, there is every probability that
recognition by the French Government
will speedily follow. The action of the
French Consul at Panama in advising his
Government that the young republic has
assumed responsibility concerning the
treaties entered Into with foreign coun
tries by the Bogota Government and all
the legal obligations of Colombia In so far
as the isthmus is concerned has removed
the principal objection that France might
have to the new regime.
of revolution, nor has the revolution thus
far spread to other provinces.
"The new state assumes all the former
treaty and legal obligations of Colombia."

"The suggestions which have been made to this Govern
ment since the failure of the treaty in Bogota, of a renewal
of negotiations, have been too vague and too extravagant to
merit the serious consideration of the United .States: and they
were such as to create the impression in the minds of the
people of Panama that there was no reasonable prospect of
the accomplishment of the object upon which their hopes and
desires had been set for many years.
"This brings us to the sudden and startling events which
have so recently attracted the attention of this country and
of the. world. Although there has been no lack for many
years past of numerous causes of discontent and anxiety
umong the people of Panama, it appears that the failure of
the canal treaty convinced them that there was nothing more
"It was too great for Individual or corporate enterprise.
it could only be Initiated and carried to a conclusion by a
government of, great power and vast resources, and the only
government to which it was a possibility was that of the
United States. By authorization of Congress the President
entered into a treaty with the Government of Bogota for the
construction of a canal by way of the . isthmus of Panama.
Wishing to show every consideration to the Government of
Colombia, the treaty contained provisions of extraordinary
liberality. A large bonus was given for the privilege of con
structing the canal, a liberal annual lease was added, and all
this was in addition to the numberless benefits which would
accrue to the Colombian Government and people from the
construction on their territory of this colossal work. ' The
treaty was promptly ratified by the Senate of the United
States and rejected unanimously and without consideration
by that of Colombia.
THE TREATY AND THE CANAL.
pendent for its efficacy on the personnel of the signers nor
the name of the territory it affects. It is a covenant, as law
yers say, that runs with the land. The name of 'New Gran
ada has passed away; its territory has been divided. But as
long as the isthmus endures the great geographical fact keeps
alive the solemn compact which binds the holders of the ter
ritory to grant us freedom of transit, and binds us In .re
turn to safeguard for the Isthmus and the world the exer
cise of that inestimable privilege.
"It is therefore too clear for discussion that when, at the
repeated solicitation of the Government of Colombia, a treaty
was entered into between that Government and the United
States for carrying into effect the long considered plan 'of a
canal across the isthmus, to be owned and controlled by the
Government of the United States, it was no new proposition
that was being adopted, but rather"the carrying out of a long
cherished plan of both countries and the assertion of a right
which had been long 3ince conceded in principle by the Gov
ernment of Colombia. It was the universal conviction that
the time had come for this gigantic project to be carried out
"Having regard only to the crisis and the needs
of the hour, no plainer duty was ever imposed upon a chief
of state than that which rested upon the President of the
United States in the Interest of the isthmus, the people of
Colombia, the people of the United States and the commerce
of the world, to preserve for the benefit of all free transit
over the isthmus and to do all that lay in his power to bring
a permanent peaTe to its people."
. "He also directed our Minister in Bogota to inform the
Colombian Government that we had entered into relations
with the new provisional government of Panama, and he took
occasion, relying upon the ties of friendship and the valu
able services which we have so often rendered to the people
of Panama and the Government of Colombia, to commend
to the respective governments the peaceful and equitable set
tlement of all questions at issue between them. He took oc
casion at the same time to give notice to the world that not
only our treaty obligations but the imperative demands of
the interests of civilization /required him to put a stop, which
we hope and believe will be a final one, to. the Incessant civil
contests and bickerings which have been for so many years
the curse of Panama.
"The course of the President in this conjunction was
marked out in advance by all our principles and precedents.
He gave orders that traffic from one side of the isthmus to
the other should be kept unimpeded by either party and
charged bur officers on the isthmus to use their utmost in
fluence to prevent any attack by one of the contending fac
tions upon the other which would be calculated to cause a
disturbance of traffic. When it was reported to him that a
government capable of maintaining order had been established
and was working without opposition, he did what is always
done under such circumstances. He directed our represent
ative at Panama, as soon as he was certain that a govern
ment capable of maintaining the public peace had been es
tablished by the consent of the people, he was to enter
into official relations with it.
PRECEDENT SUPPORTS OUR STAND.
to be hoped for in their connection with the Colombian Gov
ernment, which had never proved entirely satisfactory. They
went "to work with that talent for prompt and secret organ
ization to which there is no parallel among people of North
ern blood; they prepared the machinery of revolution in ad
vance, and suddenly, in a single day, without the firing of a
shot, with the exception of a few shells that were thrown
into the city from a Colombian steamer in the harbor of Pan
ama, they accomplished their independence. A government
consisting of the leading citizens of the State was at once or
ganized .and proclaimed to the world, a part of the Colombian
forces Joined the revolution; the rest returned to Colombia
and, so far as we are able to Judge; the new republic begins
Its career with no organized opposition throughout the entire
extent, of the isthmus. .

Senator Morgan Says the Colombian
Treaty Has Been Violated.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 6.-Senator Mor

convenes In extra session he will Introduce
a resolution calling on the Foreign Rela
tions Committee of the Senate to obtain,
from the State Department a detailed re
port of the relations between the United
States and Colombia under the treaty of
184U. According to Senator Morgan the
attitude of this country is not JuÂ«lf.cl
by a careful construction of the provis
ions of the treaty and is at variance with
precedents laid down by the United
States. In discussing the situation to
day ho said:
"This is the fourth time the United
States has landed troops on the isthmus
under the cloak of the treaty. Hereto
fore it has been for the suppression of
the rioting and for the protection of Col
ombians. Now that it is against the wish
of Colombia it undoubtedly will provoke
a just protest.
"Colombia means war. Of that I am
certain. The GovernmentVlll find that it
will have a series of complication* on
its hands not unlike that offered by the
Indians when they were met with terri
torial aggressions of this Government,
and the trouble the Colombians will make
will be similar to that of the Filipinos,
with the conduct, of warfare far more
difficult. I believe, however, the admin
istration will not have this matter to de
cide. It is a question for Congress, and
that body la not likery to shirk the re
sponsibility."

Diet after a brief skirmish with the ob

The latter turned on his tormentors and
exclaimed:
"You may shout me down, but you shall
not silence the truth. Fighting: with such
weapons only betrays the weakness of
your position."
The obstruction suddenly ceased. Count
Tisza appealed to all to remember that
they were Hungarians and to consider

yy WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â The con- i
IMJterence at the White House last
night was followed by an extend
ed discussion of the situation on the
isthmus by the Cabinet at Its regu
lar meeting this morning. There was
general satisfaction expressed at the
peaceable solution of the trouble on the
isthmus. The manifesto issued by the
provisional government has made a great
impression on the administration. It is
regarded as practically certain by the
administration officials that the negotia
tions for the construction of the Panama
canal will be opened as soon as a perma
nent government is founded, and that
Panama, instead of Colombia, will get
the $10,000,000.
The United States is willing to pay for
the canal strip. The stripping of the
isthmus of all government troops by
evacuation/ so greatly assisted by the
good offices of Commander Hubbard,
commanding the gunboat Nashville, con
vinced the administration that it was
time to take some action in the direction
of entering into relations with the de
facto government.
As a matter of fact United States Vice
Consul Ehrman at Panama, United States
Consul Malmros at Colon and the Ameri
can naval commanders have been recog
nizing the revolutionary government in
numerous conferences necessary for an
agreement as to the preservation of tran
sit on the railroad. It was announced
that the administration did not consider
it had yet formally recognized Panama,
but It was admitted that this formal rec
ognition would come later.
Rear Admiral Coghlan, who regularly
commands the Caribbean division of the
North Atlantic fleet, but whose flagship,
the Olympia, Is undergoing repairs at
Norfolk, was called to the Navy Depart
ment to-day and ordered to prepare to
go to the isthmus to assume command of
all the naval forces on the Atlantic side.
The Mayflower, Commander Gleaves, Is
now at Washington navy-yard and will
probably sail on Sunday. He will be ac
companied by Mr. Gudger, who will be
the senior consular officer on the Isthmus
when he arrives at Panama. Rear Ad
miral Coghlan and Mr. (Gudger will re
ceive the most explicit instructions from
the President. Rear Admiral Glass, com
manding the Pacific squadron, is Rear
Admiral Coghlan's senior.
The Navy Department received a cahle
to-day from Commander Delano of the
Dixie stating that the ship arrived at
Colon Thursday evening and landed a
force just after all the Colombian Gov
ernment troops had ieft on the royal mall
steamer Orinoco for Carthagena. This
landing force found an independent
party in possession of Colon. Panama and
the railroad. The Nashville had with
drawn its force. The commander of the
Merriam Is now on his way to Believe
Commander Delano, who is lrf 111 health
The change of command of the Dixie will
be accomplished at Colon.
The following telegram was sent by the
State Department to Mr. Ehrman, the
Acting Consul General of the United
States at Panama:
"The people of Panama have by an ap
parently unanimous movement dissolved
their political relations with the republic
of Colombia and assumed their independ
ence. When you are satisfied that a de
facto Government, republican in form
and without substantial opposition from
its own people, has been established In
the state of Panama, you will enter Into
relations with it as responsible Govern
ment of the territory and look to it for
all due action to protect the persons and
property of the citizens- of the United
States and to keep open the Isthmian
transit in accordance with the obligations
of existing treaties governing the rela
tions of the United States in that terri-
Immediately afterward an instruction
was sent by telegram to Mr. Beaupre, the
United States Minister at Bogota, in the
following terms:
"The people of Panama having by an
apparently unanimous movement dis
solved their political connection with the
republic of Colombia and resumed their
independence, and having adopted a gov
ernment of their own, republican in form,
with which the Government of the United
States has entered into relations, the
President of the United States, in accord
ance with the ties of friendship which
have so long and so happily existed be
tween the respective nations, most earn
estly commends to the Government of Co
lombia and of Panama the peaceful and
equitable settlement of all questions at
issue between them. He holds that he Is
bound not merely by treaty obligations,
but by the Interests of civilization, to see
that the peaceful traffic of the world
across the Isthmus of Panama shall not
longer be disturbed by a constant suc
cession of unnecessary and wasteful civil
wars."

People Grow Enthusiastic When the
Colombian Troops Depart.
PANAMA, Nov. 6.â General H; O. Jef
fries, a graduate of West Point, who yes
terday was appointed commander of tha
Pacific fleet by the provisional Govern
ment of the republic of Panama, left here
last night on board the gunboat Padllla
with orders to capture the Bogota. It
was reported that the latter had arrived
at Buena Ventura, but later the report
was contradicted.
Nearly all the munlcipalties of the isth
mus have now joined the republic.
General Guiterez, who arrived yesterday
at Colon and who came to replace Gov
ernor Obaldia, brought with him several
secretaries and a staff of fifteen, all Co
lombians, to replace the Isthmians. This,
it is pointed out here, shows how Panama
was considered at Bogota.
As up to late yesterday afternoon the
Colombian troops at Colon had not de
cided to leave the city, a division of
troops of .the republic of Panama was or
dered to attack them and was- on its way
when a telegram announced the departure
from Colon of the royal mail steamer
Orinoco with the Colombian troops. Gen
eral Tovar and staff, who had been quar
tered here, did not have time to leave,
as the steamer would not wait.
When the news of the departure qf the
Colombian troops became known here the
enthusiasm became unlimited. Thousands
of persons, with flags, torches and fire
works, headed by two bands of music,
marched through the town.
As the procession passed the United
States Consulate "The Star-Spangled
Banner" was played and the crowds cheer
ed wildly for the United States, President
Roosevelt, Commander Hubbard of the
Nashville, Secretary Hay and Acting
Consul' General Ehrman.
The procession went to General Huertas'
headquarters, and with the general borne
on the shoulders of four patriots, marched
through the town again. Dr. Amador, the
Minister of Finance of the provisional
Government, and the revolutionary junta,

TACOMA, Nov. 6.â According to news re

Trunk Pacific survey parties, are. working
around Port Simpson, not only, ashore
but in the passages leading to the port.
These waters were examined with a view
to ascertain the most feasible and con
venient route to the ocean in preparation
for the Grand Trunk's Trans-Pacific traf
fic. The surveyor assigned to this im
portant duty returned on tho Tees, and
from parties who arrived by that ship it
Is learned that his decision rests in favor
of Browns Passage. This is the water
to the south." of South Dundas Island, and
in a latitude probably twenty-five miles
south of Port Simpson itself. Vessels
using this passage can either come in
from sea by way of Queen Charlotte
Sound and Hecato Strait or to the north
of that group by the way of Dixon en
trance. The latter Is the most . direct
route to the sea, and one, therefore,
which will most likely be the course taken
by all Trans-Pacific ships. It is the chan
nel which separates Prince of Wales Isl
and from the Queen Charlotte group and
which connects Hecate Strait to the east
of the latter. Browns Passage is situ
ated at the meeting of the two.

HEW OBSTACLE
FOR CHAMBERLAIN
The Canadian Bank of Commerce began
suits yesterday against tho different
banks which had accepted checks alleged
to have been forged by E. F. Mattison,
and which checks had been subsequently
sent to the plaintiff institution, as banker
of the Continental Building and Loan As
sociation, and "honored by it.
The checks in question were issued by
the Continental Building and Loan Asso
ciation and sent to their agent, E. F.
Mattison, in Los Angeles, to be delivered
to different clients. Instead of passing
the checks to. the parties' for which they
were Intended, Mattison, it is alleged,
forged the names of tho different clients,
cashed the checks at the defendant banks,
pocketed the money and then boarding
one of the Kosmos liners, skipped away
to Germany.
The following banks are defendants in
the suits: Wells, Fargo & Co., $10,516 SÂ«;
American National Bank, ,$13,353 80; Neva
da National Bank, $27,608 90, and San
Francisco National Bank, $20,680 21.
Mattison was caught in Germany .and
now, under extradition papers, is being
returned - to the scene of his alleged
wrong-doings. The case, when it comes
to trial, will undoubtedly develop a great
deal of public interest and will be fought
bitterly on both sides.
Smith & Pringle and Gavin McNab
are attorneys for the plaintiff.
The Jacobs shop Is on East Twelfth
street, near Fifteenth avenue, and It has
been a source of great annoyance to thÂ«
police. Reuben Jacobs, the woman's hus
band, only recently was released from thÂ©
County Jail after serving a sentence for
the -theft of pipe from thÂ© Contra Costa
Water Company.
Mrs. Jacobs was ordered to appear Mon
day morning for sentence.-
It came to trial to-day before Judga
George Samuels and a jury. The woman,
made a hard fight to save herself, having
two attorneys employed. Prosecuting At
torney A. P. Leach conducted thÂ© prose
cution.
The particular offense was thÂ© buying
from Albert JLaviUe, 7 years old, of a
quantity of bottles. There wa3 only 10
cents involved, but the case was one that
the police had long been trying to fix on
the woman because of the unsavory repu
tation of her place of business. Patrolman
Fred Schroeder arrested Mrs. Jacobs on
August 1, but the trial had been postponed
from timÂ© to timÂ© for various reasons.
Charged by the police with conducting
a notorious "fence," where youthful
thieves might easily dispose of stolen
plunder, Mrs. Sarah Jacobs, a dealer In,

In "The Torch," a new novel that, has
! just come from the pen of Herbert M.
I Hopkins, formerly instructor of Latin at
\ the University of California, some of trfc
Â¦ recent history at this and Stanford Unl
! versity is ro thinly disguised behind a
, veil of romence that all the faculty mem
! bers fortunate enough to. get hold of the
bock are talking about it. The new novel
Â¦ only arrived a few days ago in the hands
! of a favored few, but already there is a
â¢ deal of chuckling going on and almost
I everybody who is anybody knows all
I about the most significant references. The
i very name of "The Torch" conveys the
} idea of burning, torture, murder, and it
! is said the reader }s never disappointed.
The author denies in a letter to a friend
j that he gathered his material from the
two California universities and declares
that the references in his book to a West
ern university comprehend a university
i in the Middle West. This may be, but
t readers of "The Torch" cannot help Bee
ing that there is a striking similarity be
tween the events that occurred subse
! qucnt to the retirement of the late Martin
; Kellogg from the presidency of the uni-
I versity and the Ross affair at Stanford
' and the events as narrated in the book.
The story begins with the retirement
: from the I'niversity of Argos of a pres
â¢ id^nt old and revered, in whom some will
I recognize a vivid likeness of the late Dr.
â¢ Kellogg. This president is succeeded by
1 a younger man from an Eastern univer
i sity, one carrying a reputation as an ath
! lete, Babington by name, which eome
1 think is only smother name for Wheeler.
The new president is expected to revo
j lutionize the economy of the university
and build it upon broader lines. But his
1 selection arouses the resentment of the
Â¦ older members of the faculty, who con
j sidered themselves entitled to promotion
I to the president's office, and some of
! them make such a show of feeling that
! the new president peremptorily dismisses
j them. The younger professors take ura
| brage at this quick method of dealing
' punishment and several of them resign,
' which, of course, makes a scandal. This
! laÂ«t incident is supposed to refer to the
1 Ross affair at Stanford. The result of
I the embroglio Is that the faculty at Ar
gos is completely demoralized.
"The Torch" was recently commented
I upon in the book reviews of the New
I York Times in the following manner:
The Torch strikes an unusual if not entirely
- new uoie in fiction in offering as its theme tha
\ inner wr.rking of a Bute university in tho
; "West. And, considering that in this case it is -
I not the students but the faculty that form the
! personnel of the story, the author succeeds in
developing some quite unexpectedly lively
eveuts among the staid dwellers in academic
grovts.
Much the Fame state of affairs is pictured
by Mr. Hopkins as is actually known to havo
i existed recently in a certain proprietary lnstltu
j tlon on the Pacific slope and the same results
; follow, much to the detriment of the univergi- Â¦Â¦
t ty's working force. It eeems strange that In a i
> State Institution euch as the author describes Â¦
po lsx a rein should have been held by the gov
; f-rnir.jj board and so much left to the diccretion
; of cne man In the management of two hundred
[or more teachers employed, but. If Mr. Hopkins'
j bock i? to be regarded as in any way authorita
tive, there are stranger things than that in the
management of State universities.
The main interest of the story lies in the au
thor's clever delineation of the president's
character and of the process by which he was
gradually stripped cf his assumptions and re
vealed to his associates in his true guise, but
there are several other exceedingly well drawr
characters, and the situations in which they are
involved, as events proceed, are both amueing
aril interesting. 1
The necessary tcuch of romance Is supplied
by a fascinating widow, who is of that coquet
tish type naturally fostered in a college town,
and ehe requires the whole book to reach a de
cision as to the conferring of hfr valuable af
fections. The general impression conveyed by
Mr. Hopkins is that the chief aim of such In
stitutions as that at Argoe is to win popularity
and students at the sacrifice of everything else,
and that neither the heads, the directors nor 1
the teaching force compare very favorably with I
those lÂ»"Ef> intimately connected with politics
ard patronage.
Mr. Hopkins, the author, is now an ln
i structor in Latin at an Episcopal acad
emy in Hartford, Conn. He left the Uni
versity of California two years ago.

POINT RICHMOND, Nov. 6.-The
women of the new and growing
city of Richmond have Organized
a club for their benefit and the
benefit of the city. The member
ship is already large, and it Is expected
to make it include the greater part of .the
women cf this district.
The women of Richmond began to feel,
as the town grew and prospered, that
they were a factor in its development,
and some weeks ago the first meetings
were held to organize an association that
would not alone aid in the development
of the individuals but of the. town. Other
cities have organizations of women who
work for the advancement of the cities
they represent .and Richmond felt that
they could do as well. The result was
the organization of the Woman's Club
of Richmond. Several preliminary meet
ings have been held and the following
officers have been elected to serve through
the first year of the existence of the new
organization:

With his party President Ripley has
just completed an extended trip through
Texas and Arizona, where he mads a
careful survey of different territories
through which the company 13 contem
plating the construction of branch lines.
Among the plans which the company has
under consideration is the building of a
branch road from Mesa City to Goldfleld,
In Arizona, a distance of about twenty
miles, and the extension of its main line
from 6ome point in New Mexico through
Gila and Salt River Valley and Phoenix,
thence in a northwesterly direction to the
Colorado River and thence south to Nee
dles. This new line, it is figured, will
overcome the present heavy grades on
that portion of the system extending
through the northern part of Arizona.
It Is not likely, however, as was ex
plained by one of the officials of the road
last evening, that this work will be un
dertaken for a year or so, for the com

country, is planning economy, and while
not retrenching on as great a scale as

large expenditures of money for improve

SAN JOSE, Nov. 6. â The loose manage
ment of Folsom prison was sarcastically
referred to by Judge Leib of the Superior
Court this morning while sentencing John
Crane for grand larceny. Crane had
asked that he be sent to Folsom prison.
"I shall send no one to Folsom orison,"
said Judge Letb, "until there la a change,
in the management, as I feel that any one
sent there may get away." Crane was
sentenced to two years^imprlsonment at
San Quentln. Crane was arrested a few
days ago for stealing a wheel at Alvlso
from Frank Topham, his employer. The
wheel was sold to a saloon-keeper and
after. Crane had drank up the proceeds
he stole the wheel and sold it to another
saloon-keeper. He pleaded guilty to the
offense and asked that he be sentenced
at once.

The Alder Mining Company ia now con
structing the most extensive mining plant
in Southern Montana, and with all the
new buildings, the piles of loose lumber
and the- dry wood and shavings every
where it is a wonder that the whole plant
was not consumed by the flames.
As soon as the news reached Virginia
City every one hurried to Summit.
County Attorney Duncan and Acting Cor
oner N. D. Johnson started out to hold an
inquest on the body of John Tobin and
remained to perform a like duty over the
bodies of the others. Superintendent Tur
ner had a wife and one child, a boy, who
arc living at the mine.
About 5 o'clock this morning fire was .
discovered issuing from the tunnel-house ,
on tunnel No. 1. At the time the flames !
were discovered the timbers in the tunnel ;
were ablaze. How the fire originated is j
not known, but at the first alarm all the ;
miners, carpenters and laborers, 150 in all,
hastened across the gulch to aid in sub- I
duing the flames. Superintendent Turner, |
whose temporary quarters are high on"the Â¦
hill across the right fork of Alder Gulch
and but a short distance from the burn-
Ing tunnel-house, at once went to the
scene and assumed the direction of af
fairs and of giving orders in regard to
the work of extinguishing the flames with
the others. He entered the tunnel
through the fire and smoke to give warn
ing to the entombed miners and to aid in
their escape. Near the mouth of the tun
nel they stumbled over the dead body of
John Tobln, who evidently had made an
effort to escape, but was driven back by
the flames and smoke. They carried the
body to the surface and once more re
entered the workings to rescue their com
rades if possible. According to the story
of a miner named Hurley, he, with Turner
and another man, entered the mine behind
i him by descending through the airshaft.
Hurley was the last of the three to. de
scend. After going some distance through
the airshaft. thick with smoke. Hurley
heard a cry and then thuds, as of bodies
striking timbers, which was followed by a
smothered splash in water.
Hurley tried to go farther down the
shaft, but was compeled to retrace his
steps. Up to a late hour this afternoon
the bodies of Tobin, Powers, Fleming and-
Donnelly were all that had been recov
ered.
Mr. Turner had been connected with
the company for several years as super-
I intendent of the Kendall mine and then
! of the Kearsarge, and' it was due to his
I management that the latter mine has
become one of the best known mines in
I Southern Montana. He was the junior
j member of the firm of Mitchell & Turner
of Butte.
TWO UNKNOWN MEN.
All the dead miners were from Butte
and were single men. The Kearsarge is
one of the principal gold mines of the
State and is considered very valuable. 1 It
is operated by the Alder Mining Com
pany.
BUTTE, Mont.. Nov. 6.â A Virginia City
special to the Miner says a fire In the
Kearsarge mine, six miles from Virginia
City, early this morning killed nine men.
The damage to surface buildings is slight.
Among the dead is Superintendent R. B.
Turner of Butte, one of the best known
mining men in the Northwest- Four
bodies have been recovered up to to-night.
The dead:
R. B. TURNER, superintendent of the

TACOMA. Wash.. Nov. 6.â Klondike
winter meat prices have been greatly
Towered by the resumption of navigation
on the Tukon last week, which permitted
t!:ree independent meat companies to rush
forward frexn While Horse shipments of
cattle and meats which had beaa caught
there by the unexpected closing of nav
igation. These dealers chartered the in
dependent steamers Casca Light, Tyrell
and Crimmin, to load at White Horse and
pick up scow loads farther down the
river. Their cargoes are now safe at
Pawson, though the Crimmin lost live
stock worth nearly $5000 from two of her
wowi at Hootalinqua. The Pacific Cold

ing been caught on the sandbar near
Circle from September unt:l late In Oc
tober.
Special Disoatch to The Call.
Walter L. Rees, a., nephew of the Lewis
brothers, testified that he took up a
quarter section of land unsolicited by any
one and that he paid his own traveling
expenses and those of his wife. He went
to Marysville expecting to borrow the
price of the land from Mr. Engle, whom
he expected to find at that place. He
had, however, sufficient money on deposit
with the Loyalton Lumber Company, due
him as wages, to pay for the land. His
wife borrowed from Engle $460. On ; the
suggestion of Engle the witness deeded
his land to Captain Roberts a month later.
Engle gave the witness $100 over and
above the note and mortgage on the land.'
On cross-examination by Mr. Schlesing
er ' the * witness stated / that on making
final proof before the land register . he
had truthfully sworn that he had- bor
rowed the purchase money from ; Mr.
Engle. The defendants had not requested
him to make the -application or to swear
to anything in it. .The witness added that
all the statements, sworn to, by him in
his \ application for the - land were true.
An adjournment j>f the court was then
taken until Monday morning at. 11 o'clock;
ENGLE LOANS MONEY.
James W. Larison testified that Arthur
TV. Keddie asked him one day whether he
would not like to locate 160 acre3 of tim
ber land. He told the witness that he
would furnish the money to Day for the
land, would find a purchaser and that
"there would be $100 in it" fcr the \vitne3s.
Mr. Keddie furnished him the money for
his traveling expenses. The witness' de
clined to make final proof and when at
the Russ House in this city In December,
1901, Keddie approached him and said:
"Hello, Jim: I understand that you and
Special Agent Cullom are putting up a
job to get me behind the bars."
"Did you receive any money from Mr.
Cullom?" asked Mr. Banning.
The objection to this question was sus
tained. On cross-examination by Mr.
Schlesinger the witness admitted that he
had not examined the land for which he
had applied, although in his. affidavit In
the land office he had sworn that he had
done so. But he had been over the land
very often before that and was familiar
with it. All the facts that he had sworn
to in the affidavit were true, he said.
MATTER OF SPECULATION.
Hiram Reed was the first witness. He
testified that on May 1, 1901, he went to
the house of R. H. Lewis In Loyalton on
Invitation of W. O. Peck. R. If. Lewis
W. S. Lewis, Bert Parker and W. O.
Peck were present and it was suggested
to him that he could take up a certain
section of timber land. Nothing was said
to him as to defraying: his expenses or
as to Belline It ,to others. The witness
examined the land and went to Sacra
mento on May G and made application at
the office of the United States Land Reg
ister at Sacramento for the land. At
Boca Creed T. Hill, foreman of the Loyal
ton Lumber Company, gave him $15 for
his expenses. The Intention ot the wit
ness was to sell the land afterward on
speculation. In order to pay for the land
he borrowed $475 from Mr. Enjfle on the
same day on which he made his final
proof, and a few hours after he had paid
for the land he sold it to Engle for $575.
The witness said that all the facts sworn
to In his application were true and that
he had made no contract or agreement
whatever with any persons for the trans
fer of the land.
Mr. Banning in his opening statement
to the jury said that he would prove that
a contract or agreement had been made
between the defendants and certain resi
dents of Loyaltort. whereby the latter re
ceived $400 each to buy a quarter section
of .timber land, $60 for expenses and $100
for profit on deeding the land to the de
fendants, and that Engle, as a real estate
agent, was to receive a commission of 50
cents for each acre turned over to the
defendants.
WITNESSES IN HIDING.
Judge de Haven remarked that motions
of that kind were never considered unless
made in the form of an affidavit, and the
trial went on.
The Indictment charges that in May and
June, 1901, the defendants procured Hi
ram Reed, Stephen L. Whlttelsey, George
R. Stimers, Creed T. Hill, James W. Lar
ison, Mrs. Corolynne E. Battelle, Walter
L. Rees and Helen Keddie to appear be
fore the registers of the United States
land offices of Plumas and Sierra coun
ties and swear that they were not apply
ing for the timber land for the use or
benefit of any person other than them
selves and that they were not buying It
for 4he purposes of speculation. It was
alleged that the defendants advanced to
each of the nine persons named $400 to
pay for the land, $60 expenses and $100 as
their commission. - '.-
When Bert Schleslnger announced that
the defendants were ready for trial Mr.
Banning asked for a continuance on the
ground that the United States Marshal
had been unable to serve subpenas upon
George Stimers, Mrs. Corolynne E. Bat
telle. Creed T. Hill, Steve Whittlesey,
William S. Mead and Mrs. Jennie Ens
coe. He added that these witnesses were
in hiding because the husbands of Mrs.
Battelle and Mrs. Enscoe had informed
the Marshal that they did not know
where their wives were or what they
were doing. The family of William 8.
Mead had professed also not to know
where he could be found.
Whether the United States Government
intended that the timber lands open for
sale should be acquired only by agricul
turists owning adjacent" ground . and \ for
their own exclusive use only, or whether
It was intended that the timber resources
of the country were to be developed ir
respective of the personality or numbers
of the developers. Is the issue now on
trial. In the United States District Court.
The case is that-of. the United States
against James H. Engle, William S.
Lewis, Richard. H. Lewis and Arthur W.
Keddie, the wealthy owners of the Boca
and Loyalton Railway Company and of
the Loyalton Lumber Company in Sierra
County. The Federal Grand Jury had
found four Indictments against the de
fendants charging subornation of perjury
and conspiracy to violate an act of Con
gress by acquiring timber lands through
their agents.
Two of the indictments were quashed
several months ago and | the defendants
were discharged. The trial began yes
terday upon one . indictment charging
subornation of perjury.

California quicksilver. The various quick

'At former expositions the exhibits of minerals
and ores made by State commissions have not
been as comprehensive or as representative as
they f-hould have been. Neither the mining; en
gineer of to-day nor the 'general public ia im
pressed with seeing: large specimens of ores es
pecially delected for exhibit What the engi
neer desires to see â and It Is on his informa
tion that capitalists make Investments â is an
exhibit which will illustrate not only, the aver
age richness of the deposit, but which will
show the country rock contiguous to such de
posits. - The country rock is the basis upon
which the mining engineer makes his Investiga
tions, and If the above plan Is carried out by
the various State commissions he will have an
opportunity Of examining the country rock of
the famous Tnines of one State and of compar
ing and contrasting them with the country rock
of mines in other States. We are endeavoring to
have this Idea carried out in its fullest detail,
and Â¦ ask the co-operation of the commissions
from the various mining States with this end In
view and we trust that you will aid us as far as
may be possible.
Relief topographical/ models of States
and countries will be used to show the
difficulties of mining in any particular
section and all . problems .connected with
the . mineral and ore deposits and their
development. The entire subject of min
ing, to condense the review, will be con
sidered from all points. California will
contribute some of the most interesting
features to be found In the mines build
ing, an estimate of which must be re
served until State Mineralogist Aubury
has completed the work of making the
California collection for display.
A letter has been received from Joseph
A. Holmes, chief of the Department of
Mines and . Metallurgy at St. Louis, In
which are contained several hints that
may prove valuable to the miners In con
tributing their ores and mineral sub
stances. This, in part, is as follows:
The literature and scenic aspect of min
ing will be Illustrated. Each State or
country is supposed to furnish at least
one map showing the age and extent of
the geological formations of the State or
country. Each will also provide a large
map upon which can be shown by sym-
bols or colors the distribution of all the
valuable mineral or ore deposits. Smaller
sized maps are to show the distribution
in any State or country of one important
mineral. One such map will show the
distribution of the gold deposits, another
the iron or coal or copper; others "will In
dicate the distribution of surface or ar
tesian waters, water powers, irrigation
reservoir sites and the like.
This group will show the equipment and
processes for the handling and prepara
tion of 'ores, hand sorting, storing,
sampling, "crushing ana pulverizing,
screens and screening, concentrating, ele
vating, conveying, dryings etc., amalga
mation, cyaniding, smelting of ores, the
treatment of iron ores and the manufac
ture of iron and steel In ingots and in
commercial form, the processes used In
the metallurgy of copper, of gold and sil
ver, of tin, zinc, nickel and cobalt, alumi
num, etc.
THE SCIENTIFIC VIEW.
The exhibits, so the mining public is in
formed, will be classified under fifteen
separate departments, each of which has
in rutnbeen subdivided into groups and
classes. In the mines and metallurgy de
partment, there will be five groups and
fifty-three classes. In one group will be
shown the Â¦Â¦ equipments and methods for
geological . surveys, prospecting for min
eral veins and deposits, assaying, analyz
ing and testing ores; drilling, cutting or
otherwise breaking down rock or other
mineral in â¢ open quarries, open cuts or
mines; sinking shafts, opening galleries,
drifts or tunnels and timbering; electric,
compressed air or other motors for use in
opening and operating mines and quar
ries and for operating equipment for
handling ores or other minerals; explo
sives and methods of placing and firing
the same; equipment for the underground
handling and transportation of ore, etc.;
machinery and appliances for draining
mines and quarries; pumps for oil wells:
equipment for and method of ventilating
mines; the methods and equipments for
lighting mines; safety cages, signals and
other appliances for safety; methods and
equipment for handling mining products
and for their above-surface transporta
tion; the machinery and appliances for
the working of salt mines, petroleum
wells, metalliferous sands, gravels, etc.,
and the methods and equipments for quar
rying stone.
This group has possibly the most at
tractive features for the spectators from
all parts of the world, who will take a
sort of hasty and primary educational
view of the mines and minerals and the
great variety of means that have been
devised to make up modern mining
processes. There is, however, a group of
even greater interest to persons conver
sant with mining in its economical as
pect.
Bordering the great mines building
along the southwest side a space 200 feet
wide by 750 long has been set aside . for
working exhibits in mining, metallurgy
and electro-chemistry. Tunnels for under
ground I mining will penetrate the hill that
faces the building on the southwest side.
On an extension of this out-of-door area,
lying to" the south and southwest of the
building, will be located the ore and quar
ry yards, the derricks for deep drilling
outfits, equipment for placer mining and
kindred exhibits In operation. The area
of .this adjacent ground for working ex
hibits is from ten to twelve acres, making
the total area provided for mining quar
rying and metallurgical exhibits about
twenty acres in total.
SOME CLASSIFICATIONS.
The general scope of the mines and min
erals exhibition to be made at St. Louis
is defined by a publication Just out which
Is of more than ordinary interest to the
miners of California who are now provid
ing samples of the ores of this State to
be taken to the great world's show to be
compared with what other States and
countries can display. The mines building
covers an area of nine acres, being larger
than any structure provided for a like
purpose in the history of world's fairs.
It is divided into eight nearly equal oblong
parts, 'over each of which is a glass cover
and ventilated arcade thirty to fifty feet
wide, which will furnish abundant light
for the exhibits below.
General Greely recommends the pur
chase of Eurplus submarine cable among
the other war materials. Adherence to
the International Telegraph Union Is
urged. It !s said to be a matter of the
utmost importance that signaling ap
paratus be Installed, so as to permit of
inter-communleatlon between the army
and navy on the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts.
The value of the telegraph and tele
phone business transacted by the corps
in the Philippines is estimated at $1.5W.w
friO, and it ?a al*o stated: "The entire cost
of the Signal Corps, including pay, cloth
ing, rations, transportation, cable ship ex
penses, etc., are believed to be well within
$400,000. so that the SJgnal Corps of the
army has rendered sut vices in the Philip
pines whose value exceeds by more than
$1,000,000 the entire expenses connected
with the corps.
"This has simply been done by over
working the men of the Signal Corps anu
by their underpayment, as elsewhere
stated."
WASHINGTON. Nov. 6. - General
Greely, chief of the signal office of the
United States army, in his annual report
to the Secretary of War, shows that dur
ing the year the system of military tele
graph lines and cables in Alaska author
ized byy Congress has been completed and
c-onsirt of 1740 miles. General Greely
commends very highly Captain Burnett,
who was in charge of the telegraph con
struction work in Alaska, and his assist
ants. Captains Mitchell and Ginners. Ho
speaks of the extreme difficulties encoun
tered in running telegraph lines in the
far north. Of the enlisted men of the
Signal Corps, who made up the construc
tion parties. General Greely says:
"It is doubted whether in the peaceful
annals of the army there have been met
with -nobler fortitude by the enlisted men
under equal conditions such hardships
and privations."
Tribute also is paid to the line of the
army for its service in connection with
the telegraph construction in Alaska.
General Greely says efforts are being
made, with prospects of success in 1904, to
estabJish communication by wireless teleg
raphy between St. Michael and Nome,
across Norton Sound, a distance of 108
miles. The general says the main Alaska
telegraph lines entail a heavy burden on
the Signal Corps and on the garrisons in
Alaska and recomemnds that the four
companies stationed at Fort List-urn, Gib
bon and St. Michael be increased to 100
men at the earliest practicable date.
The connection by submarine cable of
the detached system in Southeastern
Alaska with that of the Yukon district is
recommended; also an increase In the en
listed strength of the corps in order that
unduly prolonged service on foreign sta
tions may not be necessary as now, and
further that an additional colonel be au
thorized for the corps.

CARL MUCKE'S FAMOUS PICTURE, "THE BETROTHAL."
THE BETROTHAL.
Sunday Call Art Supplement
A great artist once said that the most successful
genre pictures have always for their subjects some-
thing relating'to love or war. It is only natural that
love, which every living being is destined to experience,
should . furnish subjects which attract, and the only as-
pect of the contrasting emotion of hate which is not
despicable is war, and even that is ennobled only by a
love of country or a love of right.
Carl Mucke's picture, "The Betrothal," depicts the
" action which is a formal acknowledgment of the exist-
ence of love, but at the same .time the attitude of the
figures of the young nan and woman, their expression %
and their regard tell more than actions of srivine and
accepting the betrothal ring, which is but a symbol.
The fact that the principal roles in the scene are
â¢ played by a humble Dutch fisherman and his dulcinea
' only serves to strength the sentiment of the picture be-
cause the sentiment -of love is generally conceded 'to
have a stronger hold on the simple minds of the lowly
"than upon' minds" distracted "by" multiplicity of consid-
- 'â¢-Â¦ eratibns which beset people in- higher' walks, of life.

ford University and the University of California elevens
draws near the prospects that the opposing teams will be
evenly matched grows correspondingly brighter. Early in the
season it seemed the gridiron experts from the State Univer
sity would have matters all their own way when it should
come to the big game, but the supporters of the Cardinal have
become amazingly strong meanwhile. Unless there should be
some wholly unexpected developments within the next week
California will go into the game with the stronger line, while
Stanford will have an advantage in the backfield. From present
indications it would appear that the Cardinal should make most
of her gains around the end and the Berkeley boys should ad
vance the ball more advantageously through the right of their
opponents' line. On exchanges of punts Overall, for the Blue
.and Gold, will gain many yards. Through the prowess of this
same redoubtable kicker California will have a better chance
for field goals. Clark, Smith and Stevenson, of Stanford, are
in every respect the equals of California's ends. The quarter
hacks are evenly matched. Dole or Tarpey, Chalmers and
Weller are probably superior to the Blue and Gold backs, al
though Mini iÂ§ playing a brilliant game. A rainy day and a
sodden field will bring both teams down to a dead level with
every chance for either eleven to win.

The Scottish bowling tournament, which
has been In progress at the.Golden Gate
Park rinks for some months, will be com
pleted next Saturday. There are but two
matches left to be played. The semi-final
match, between James Gray and J. Mc-
Lachlan, will be played this afternoon.
The winner will meet J. C. MofT.it in tho
final next Saturday afternoon. The three
remaining players are evenly matched and
the two matches will surely be close and
exciting. The defeat of Joseph Gray at
the hands of McLachlan on last Saturday
was a surprise; in fact, there have been
numerous surprises all through the event.

SETTERS.
AN entry of thirty-two high class
sporting dogs has been received by
Secretary Albert Betz for the twen
ty-first renewal of the Pacific Coast
Field Trials Club's Derby. Of the high
class dogs entered seventeen are setters
and fifteen are pointers.
Ten sections of land on the Haggin and
Tevis property, near Bakersfield, j have
been set aside for the trials. They are
being carefully patrolled, and the keeper
reports fully three times as many birds
as last year. The cover Is excellent.
R. M. Dodge is working a string of
twenty dogs at Lakeside. Coutts and
Lucas are also on the ground with a
number of dogs. William Dormer will be
on hand this year. He has his string at
Monterey at present. The trials will be
gin on January 11, 19(M. The entries fol

Raymond is a born ball player, yet no
one ever heard of him till he was given
a chance by Harris. Morley considers the
youngster the best pickup of the sea
son. Next year he will in all probability
be the steady second baseman of the
southern aggregation.
It seems the Portlanders will be well
entrenched in fourth place by the end of
the week. If they once land there they
are sure to stay and then Mike Fjsher
may be compelled to do some hot footing
In order to uphold the dignity of the third
place position, for the Brownies are good

winning gait.
The San Francisco ball team has been
without doubt the greatest disappoint
ment of the year. When the season start
ed Uncle Hank really believed he. had
corraled the fastest minor league ball
nine in America. Some of the fans may
have been possessed of the same notion
then, but 90 per cent of them will now
affirm that Uncle's aggregation would not
do for the Oregon bush league.
It is to be hoped we will have a ball
team next year that will be a credit to
the city. San Francisco Is the greatest
ball town in all America, taking every
thing into consideration, and it is a shame
the baseball public cannot have the pleas
ure of pointing with pride to a collection
of stars that would uphold -the dignity of
the city. Instead of a forlorn bunch which
keeps sliding down the toboggan as the
season advances.
each other as to whether San
Francisco or Oakland will run last It
is a good even money bet, as both the
Natives and the Cripples are pretty flun

a license to be the tail ender.
NOW that the baseball season is
fast coming to a peaceful close the
fans are busy making bets with
The handicap singles tournament, which
was finished on the park courts Sunday,
was the largest ever held In the city. It
was easily the most successful event held
by the Golden Gate Club. Clarence Grif
fin, the young player who so cleverly won
the event, displayed wonderful cleverness
for so young a boy. He has made rapid
progress since he took up the game two
or three years ago, and among the youns
er players is easily the most promising on
the coast. Will Allen Is another man who
distinguished himself in thla event. He
was Griffin's opponent in the finals and
made an excellent showing.
The Golden Gate Club will hold a mixed
doubles tournament at the park oÂ»
Thanksgiving day. On the Sunday follow
ing there" will be a class singles event.
Many teams are expected to enter to
morrow mornins. The handicapping will
be done by the tournament committee,
which Is composed of Frank Strlngham,
Will Allen and Chester Smith. The handi
capping will be carefully done, with the
Idea of giving the poorer players a better
chance than usual. The cups are to be
won three times, not necessarily in suc
cession. All matches but the finals â¢will
be two sets out of three, finals three out
of five. Play will be called at 10 a. m.
Entries will close at 9:30. Those not on
hand when play is called will be de
faulted.
The following teams have already en
tered: Frank Mitchell and J. D. Mao-
Gavin, Will Allen and I>r. Hill. , Herbert
Schmidt and Harry Rolfe. George Muel

Chester Smith, Sidney Salisbury and

There will be a handicap doubles tennis
tournament on the California Club courts
to-morrow. It Is the second of a series, of
handicap event9 for the new Directors'
cup. The first tourney brought out a fair
sized entry list, but the one to-morrow
will have many more teams. All of the
best players will compete, as will the
poorer players. The holders of the cups
are Will Allen and Dr. H. P. HilL
The two scratch teams that figured in
the first tournament have split up. In fu
ture Frank Mitchell and Drummond Mac-
Gavin will play together in the cup
events. Grant Smith will Join forces with
his brother Chester. They made a strong
combination in the last series for the
Davis cups, which they won handily. They
will probably be more heavily handi
capped in future. Sidney Salisbury and
Frank Stringham will bo one of the new
teams that will be hard to beat. Both
men play good doubles â in fact, much bet
ter than singles. They will be on tho
mark with Hill and Allen and tho Smith
brothers.
Second of the Series for the California
Club Directors* Cup Will BÂ«

The Stanford team, with the possible
exception of two or thr* e positions, can be
named at the present time. At the ends
of the line Veteran Left End George
Clark '04 and Smith '06. a new man. will
be in the initial line-up, barring accidents.
Sprstt '("6 will hold down his old position
at left tacklp and will probably do the
kicking for the eleven. Right tackle is
one oT the positions etill open. The place
lies between Shields '04 and Stillman '05,
with chances slightly In favor of the
former because of his greater weight.
Big Thompson, who played guard on the
â¢ni varsity, will line up at left guard
against California on the 14th. He is the
heaviest man In the line and can be
counted on to give Captain Overall,
whom he will oppose, a good, hard tussle
during the entire game. The position of
right guard, like that of right tackle, is
not settled. Jacobs '04 and C. E. Hyde
â¢(â¢4 are the leading candidates for tho
place, with the chances at present slightly
in favor of the former. Hauverman, the
veteran center, has his position cinched
and can be depended upon to play a con
sistent game.
Behind the line three positions can be
considered fairly well settled. Captain
Bansbark at quarter, "Savage" Dole at
left naif and "Jim" Weller at full. There
are at least three other men trying for
these positions who are almost as good
an the three named, but the Initial line
up will probably be as stated. Freshman
Stott 1* considered the equal of Captain
Bansbach, although he has not. of course,
had the varsity experience. Dave Tarpey
has been playing a emavhing game at left
half and if Dole has, for any reason, to
be taken from the game, the loss by sub
stitution nil I not be noticed materially.
Both Scholflcld '06 and Shine '06 have been
playing fullback in good form. At right
half Chalmers, a freshman, is the leading
candidate, although Brennan '07 and
Chancier '04 are pressing him hard for the
position.
Secret practice is the order on the grid
iron now and the results of the next few
days' work will be anxiously awaited by
the rooters. A great many rough edges
have to be worn off the team work, the
signals have to be learned much better
and fumbling must be eliminated during
the next four practices if Coach Lana

;. gainst Berkeley. Of course. Stanford
will havf had the advantage of an extra
week of practice and therefore compara
tively should put up a little better game
than California did laet Saturday. _^
If Captain Overall had played his four
years and left Berkeley the Stanford
rooters would be willing to wager their
next semester's college credit that Cali
fornia could not beat Stanford by a larger
score than 6 to 0, if they were able to
score at all on the new cardinal aggrega
tion. But with "Ovie" in the game, be it
football or baseball, it is an uncertain
proposition as to what the score may be;
wondering what chances for vic
tory the Stanford team has and whether
history will repeat itself along the line
of the reversal of form displayed in this
year"B freshman game. Most of the car
dinal adherents are hoping and yet ad
mitting that such a big streak cf good
fortune can hardly be expected in one
year.

It eeems to be definitely understood that
"Johnny" More will fill out again in his
old position at quarterback. Belknap lost
so much practice through injuries that he
is not in the best form, and Geary, who
plays a good game, is a little too light for
the position.
The line will be about the same as it
has been all season, the only likelihood of
change being in regard to ends. Hudson
is on his feet again, but If he goes into
the big game it will only be for a short
time, as his mending leg will not stand
much of a strain. Oliver seems to be till
ing Hudson's place satisfactorily. Clary
has been displacing Demeritt at left end
part of the time this week.
A. good deal depends on the way the
men play against the University of Ne
vada eleven to-day at Berkeley. Who
ever shows up well In this game will be
sure of a place. A special scrutiny will
be made of the halfback playing. .
Trainer Walter Christie announces the
weights of the men of the football squad
as follows:
the news that he is on the short
end in the betting. It shows him the pub
lic is discounting the value of the article
he is putting up and it hurts his pride so
much that he immediately resolves to re
verse the opinion of the spectators.
The men of the University of California
football eleven got a taste of this adverse
opinion of their wares this week through
the reports of the state of the odds that
have come floating across the bay. The
rumors that bets were being made at
6 to 5 and 5 to 4 and even at greater odds
carried their etlng and the effect on the
team has been wholesome. The men
played together better than since the sea
son began and the individual effort at the
same time improved wonderfully, so that
things look more hopeful for a a good
fighting machine than they did a week
ago. when the team eeemed demoralized.
A good deal of speculaton is going on as
to who the backs will be. It is pretty cer
tain "Jim" Forse will be the fullback, be
cause there is no other man on the squad
of all those .that have been tried out who
can fill the bill so well. But as to the
halfbacks they are all evenly matched
and none has any particular advantage
over the other. , Mini, "Jack" Whipple.
Snedigar. Muther. Kittrelle and Rlsley
are all fairly good at the game, but they
are not stars of the caliber of Hall or
"Locomotive" Smith. The chances are
that Mini and Whipple or Bnedigar will
be put in first in the intercollegiate game
and then the others, according as the
game goes.

The California greyhounds made an ex
cellent showing at the Waterloo and In
other events on the coursing circuit of
the Middle West. Rubber Ankles was the
bright star in the Waterloo, winning that
classic in decisive style. Among the other
California greyhounds which started were
Laughing Water. Talk To Me. Consort,
Rector, White Hat, 'Cloudburst, Sweet
Emma, Real Article, Lord Brazen, Craw
ford Belle and Frisco Lad.
The officials of the Los Angeles Cours
ing Club have inaugurated a Southern
California Futurity stake for puppies
whelped on or after January 1, 1903. They
must be the property of a member of a
club represented on the California Cours
ing Committee. To be eligible puppies
must be registered with Secretary Cham
bill before January 1, 1904. The fees are
the same as those of the Inter-State
Coursing Club's Futurity. The club will
add $300 to the stake, which will be run in
September, 1904. It will not conflict with
the California Futurity. Many nomina
tions are expected, as It increases the
value of a puppy to have it eligible.
Coursing is being revived at Chicago In
a modest manner. A twenty-dog stake
was run recently under the auspices of
the Chicago Coursing Club. Greyhounds
from, St. Louis carried off all the honors.
E. J. Brown of St. Louis judged, while
Michael Allen handled the leash.
Coursing has been resumed at Butte,
Mont^. under the management of Peter
Teague, who has leased the grounds of
the Montana Coursing Club. Jack Wes
son is acting as judge and Harry Corbls
as slipper. Among the California dogs
running there are Warpath, New Moon,
Lear King, May Be Kind, Might Be Keen,
Fred Freedom and Parader.

the yachting season of 1D03 will take
place. It is high water at 1:04 p. m. at
the entrance to San Francisco harbor,
but the tide will run flood for an hour
longer in Tiburon cove.
The arrangements for raising the bridge
will be in charge of Port Captain John H.
Keefe of the Corinthian Yacht Club.
Towed by puffing but willing launches and
by heated mariners in small boats the
yachts will be ushered Into the quiet
waters, where they will be anchored se
curely until early In April. 1004. The new
bridge that is to span the entrance to the
cove is not yet complete, and the creak-
Ing timbers of the old bridge will be
raised high in the air once more before
going out of business altogether.
Not only will most of the yachts of the
Corinthian Club be taken into the lagoon,
but some craft of the San Francisco
Yacht Club and others that do not fly the

6NOTED MOTORISTS AND THEIR POWERFUL CATJ3 WHICH PLATED A PROMINENT PART YESTERDAY AFT
ERNOON AT INGLESIDE TRACK IN SEVERAL EVENTS AT THE GREAT RACE MEET HELD UNDER
THE AUSPICES OF THE AUTOMOBILE CLUB OF CALIFORNIA.
With one withdrawal, there were three
starters in the first race, for gasoline cars
only, 6% horsepower and under, at two
miles. It proved an easy victory for- W.~
S. Hunt, who drove his Oldsmobile home
first in 3:27 1-5. C-. S. Luckhardt finished
second with his Rambler in 3 31 1-6, and
W.H. Kellogg third with a buckboard In
3:40 3-5. The first prize was $50, the second
a silver cup.
Next ) came a five-mile open event Â¦ for
cars | weighing 1200 pounds and over, the
first prize being $100, the second $25. W. F.
Winchester \ went \ away ; In the : lead with
his Franklin car and stayed there, com

Oldfleld lapped all of his competitors in
the ten-mile race, the first prize for which
was $400, but in the five-mile open event
he met defeat with his "Baby Bullet" car,
when the smooth running White racer!
driven by Walter Grothe, glided away
from the others after the second mile,
winning in 6:04 2-5. the fastest time made
during the afternoon.
Next In point- of attraction was un
doubtedly the big $12,000 Mors racer, own
ed by George P. Whlttell, and driven by
Pierre Desmet. This car figured in the
great Paris-Berlin race, and with Its
sputter and tireless chug, chug, chug.
pounding like the explosion of a million
Chinese firecrackers, could be heard com
ing a block away.
Barring one or two unavoidable waits
due to broken chains or valves, the ar
rangements were -perfect. The judges
were J. D. Spreckels, R. p. Schwerin and
S. G. Buckbee. Referee, I* P. Lowe. W.
W. Everett acted as chief "docker," aid
ed by Captain L. R. Burgess, John Ham
mersmith, Edwin Mohrig, C. E. Matthew
son and others. R. C. Lennie acted as
clerk of the course and H. C. Brown and
L. C. Lowe were the umpires.
Jack Gleason set a new fashion for
starters to follow by appearing in a
Prince Albert coat and gray trousering
and wearing a tall hat. His ; excellent
work with the ' red flag would indicate
him to be a veteran at the game.
Frank Thompson with his musical
basso, made a splendid announcer, con
tributing much to the pleasure .of the
day's sport. Â«.
Previous to the calling of -tfe* first race
Barney Oldfleld started off on '^-record
breaking stunt,. but after covering; a. mile
In 1:04 2-5 he concluded the track was a
trifle too cuppy and slowed, down. The
record for a mile over a circular course
Is 55 4-5 seconds, made by Oldfleld at the
Empire City track.
EASY VIOTOBY FOB HUNT.
OLDFIELD LAPS OPPONENTS.
All noted men have their peculiarities
and Oldfleld has his. Before every ap
pearance on the track he must needs light
up a fresh cigar, which is so tightly
clinched between his teeth that a Kan
sas cyclone would not disturb the ashes.
As Barney whizzes by the stand, seated
low In his red Bullet No. 2 racing car of
120 horsepower and weighing 2040 pounds,
coatless and hatless, his long brown locks
flowing In the wind, he looks every inch
like a young man started on a trip to
Mars astride a skyrocket.
Needless to remark, Barney Oldfleld, the
champion motorist, was the cynosure of
all eyes and the bright twingling star of
the occasion. Barney haB broken many
records during hia epeedy career as a
motor driver and a rib or two as well In
accomplishing the same.
It was freely predicted that the ambu
lance corps from the Park Emergency
Hospital would be rung- up before two
events were over, but the sport itself was
not marred by hitch nor accident.
9:15 1-5. C. S. Luckhardt with a Rambler
pulled up at the start and was left.
Eight started in the five-mile handicap
for motor cycles, the prizes being hand-
Bome diver cups. Although E. SI. Coffin
with his Duck cycle made the best time,
7:26, starting from scratch, first prize
went to Thomas A. White, with a 30-sec
ond handicap and whose official time was
10:16 3-&. Then came H. Swanton in his
Indian in 10:51. and E. M. Coffln, 10:56 4-6.
A. H. Thompson, George Dunn, W. A.
Swan and Montie Fink were also con
testants.
In (the five-mile number for gasoline
cars only, twenty-four horsepower and
under, there were only two starters. The
big Toledo car resembling the prescription
counter in a drug store and driven by W.
E. Saunders, with a chauffeur for ballast,
who threw himself out on the inside step
at the turns, looking like the spinnaker
of the Reliance, made quick work of the
Franklin, with W. F. Winchester at the
wheel. The latter was indulged with the
lead in the second mile, but only for a
one-night stand. The winner's time was
6.46 4-5. Time of the Franklin, 6:52.
The fifth race, an open event at five
miles, for cars 1S0O pounds and under,
with the first prize $200 and the second
$50, marked the first appearance of Cham
pion Oldfield in competition. lie drove his
baby Bullet car, which proved no match
at all for the steam White car, the latter
leading the last three miles and winning
off in 6:04 2-5. Oldfleld was second in
6:17 4-5. Then followed H. D. Ryus with
another White in 6:28, and the Mors in
7:22 2-5.
FAST FIVE MILES.
Then followed another five-mile race
for cars irrespective of power or weight,
the two prizes being silver cup3. The
Toledo car, driven by W. E. Saunders.
with its outrigger chauffeur, again turned
up a winner, leading after the first mile
and finishing the route in 6:25. F. A.
Garbutt was second with his White steam
car in 7:13, and the giant Mors third a
fifth of a second slower. W. F. Winches
ter, driving a Franklin, drew out on the
first mile and H. T>. Ryu's White blew out
a cylinder on the last lap.
It was awful what Barney Oldfield did
to the other four starters in the ten-mile
race. Oldfield contented himself with per
mitting William Graham in "baby Bul
let" to set the pace for nearly five miles,
then he cut loose with Bullet No. 2. One
mile was covered in 1:001-5, the ten miles
in 11:15 1-5. Graham finished second i in
11:513-5; W. Grothe, with a "WTiite, third
in 13:44, and Desmet, with the Mora, car,
fourth in 14:24 3-5. No time was take'n of
the Toledo, and as W. E. Sanders, who
drove the car, claimed to be entitled to
.third prize the matter was left to the
referee. '
A five-mile handicap open to all cars
legitimately owned on . the Pacific Coast
concluded the day's sport, making In all
eight races. C. C. Eib, with an Oldsmo
bile, finished first from a two minute and
thirty seconds handicap In 8:46 2-5. The
Mors car," with a forty seconds allowance,
was second. W. H. Kellogg, F. R. Luck
hard t, C. S. Luckhardt and W. P. Win
chester also operated cars In the race.
The : first prize ' was $100. the . second $30
and the third a silver cup.

THE initial day of the race meeting
held under the auspices of the Au
tomobile Club of California at In-
gleside track yesterday was attend
ed by fully 3000 devotees of the horseless
vehicle.
The grandstand was well filled with a
fashionably attired gathering of both
sexes. Wealth and beauty graced the
clubhouse verandas and for fully an
eighth of a mile automobiles and auto
cars of every make and description filled
with people of prominence in the society
world lined the fence on the inner field.
For the nonce the poor horse was forgot
ten. A careful scrutiny through a pair
of powerful binocular field glasses failed
to discern one within a radius of seven
miles.
But, yes, there was one. Hidden away
in the recesses of the shed wan a black
trotter driven to the course by Starter
Jack Gleason, and for this glaring breach
of automobllistlc etiquette the Olympic
Club's leader was frowned upon the whole
afternoon.

SUMMARY.
The two teams should have been play
ing ball yet- Both pitchers were throwing
overything thÂ»y had, and the batters on
both sides were swinging their heads on*
trying to locate a few of the mysterious
curve* that came floating up to the plate
or else broke away long before the men
with the sticks were ready to clout 'em
out.
The only run wa? negotiated during the
progress of the second. Krug drew a pass
and Lynch bunted along the first base
line. Thielman fielded the ball to Free
man, but :he latter neglected to plant
his foot on the bag, so Lynch was safe.
Pabst advanced them both with a sacri
fice. Delmas hit to Francis and Krug was
headed off at the plate. This mado two
out. and it seemed about over. Delmas
then made a dash for second, and at the
i-ame moment Lynch started for the plate.
Sh^a was just bad enough to throw the
*>all to Holling-sworth. and Lynch was
speedy enough to beat the return peg: to
the plate, so that is the story of the only
run, whirh Shea allowed to register by
lir.iry? the ball away to catch a base-run
ner when all hands should have played
fur the batter. The score:

CHICAGO. Nov. 6.â The stewardif'of
the Western Jockey Club to-day
defied the political influences
which compelled the Harlem
Jockey Club Judges to reinstate
Turfman D. J. Lynch. They ruled him
off the turf for life. Punished with
Lynch are Trainer C. Llnd and Jockey
Treanor. AH were concerned in the al
leged doping of race horsea at Hawthorno
and at Harlem tracks.
When Owner Lynch and his trainer and
Jockey came unrter the ban at Hawthorne
the Harlem officials also barred them.
The judges at Hawthorne refused to take
official action when pressure was brought
to bear to reinstate the men, but a prom
inent part owner of the Cicero track
caused a statement to be Usued that the
suspension had been lifted. The Harlem
Judges. Colonel Hamilton and Martin Na
thanson. Usued a statement which caused
a tempest in turf circles. It stated that
certain Influences which the Harlem
Jockey Club had neither the power nor
the inclination to defy had compelled the
reinstatement of Lynch. A storm of crit
icism over the reinstatement of a turf
man who had not been cleared of the>
charges against him, threw the whola
matter into the hands of the stewards of
the Western Jockey Club. Under the
terms of the constitution anri by-laws of
the turf governing body, the summary
punishment of Lynch and hia colleagues
for the "good of the turf" was permis
sible.

HABEY TENNY OUTPOINTS
CLEVER BABNEY DBISCOLX*
Little Men Furnish a Four Bound
Boxing Bont Full of Exciting
Incidents. .
Harry Tenny upheld bis reputation as Â«
great little fighter last night when he out
pointed Barney Driscoli in a fierce four
round bout, literally cutting the latter'a
face to ribbons. The little men furnished
the main event of the Lincoln Club's
monthly exhibition, and it brought out a.
packed house. The remainder of the pro
gramme was fairly good, but the star at
traction classed Away above any amateur
bout that has been witnessed for a lonjr
time.
In every round Tenny had thÂ» better ot
his man and was the aggressor from tha
outset. He nearly severed Driscoll'a right
ear, and the rest of the tatter's face also)
bore marks of terrific punishment. Threa
times during the bout Driscoli went down,
but he showed hia true gameness to tha
last and would never give in. Tenny was)
not punished in the slightest and appear
ed as fresh at the end of the bout as ho)
did when the gong sounded for the battle.
Frank Mannasso, who would be mis
taken for Jeffries by many tenderfeet,
was pitted against Ike McLaughlin. tha
big man from Butchertown. and lost tha
decision. Mannasso knew nothing about
the game, and did not seem to be pos
sessed of great strength for such a giant.
In fact, neither man did any fighting, but^
the decision was given to McLaughlin oa
general principles seemingly.
Jim Linegar put up> a game battle
against Bob Lundie, but finally succumb
ed to a few strong body punches in thÂ»
fourth. Harry King, a lad who looked
fat enough to be a pork butcher, had to
stop in the second round of his bout with,
Charles Augustus. Jack Doyle outpointed
William Desmond and Joe Kelly was
awarded the decision over "William FrieL

day with Its presence. The day was
an Ideal one, and the members of
the fair sex appeared in large numbers.
The inner track was filled with runabouts,
in which were well-known people of the
smart set. The ladies presented a strik

A writer in the current Harper's Week
ly reports an amusing new anecdote
which Bishop Potter tells on himself.
"When one has lived for years In Ameri
ca without any special title in ordinary
conversation," says the Bishop, "It is not
easy to become accustomed to being hail
ed as 'my lord' whenever any service id
rendered. .- During "my various trips' to Eu
rope I found it , impossible to, go any
where or do anything . without being
'lcrded', right "and", left. At' last I was in
a fair way of becoming spoiled, ' when a
little occurrence mercifully delivered me.
I had reached home, after a- run abroad,
and while descending the gangplank met
a mend, an old vestryman of mine. He
was hurrying on board to receive his wife
and daughters. Pausing midway up the
plank, he grasped my hand and shouted:
" 'WhÂ». hÂ«Uo. J3iÂ»H! Wnnr ua ytatxT ."
Against His Dignity.
A young man, ' reputable, self-supporting, industrious and
otherwise worthy, arrived a few days ago from Australia and
was immediately pounced upon and deported as a contract
laborer. He came here assured of a good salary as a bank
clerk in one of our local institutions. V The ; idiocy of our
Federal laws in such matters is emphasized by the interesting
fact that hordes of coolie "native sons" have cheated the
Government and are eluding the barriers to a successful ad
mission to this country.
The desire to escape seems to have become a habit at the
Folsom penitentiary. This follows inevitably as an effect
from a cause. If some of the jailbirds had been &ot to
death in their first effort and those subsequent
had been promptly hanged the prison would now be a model
of right behavior. Fear, not reformation, is the guide to
sweetness and light in a penitentiary. >â¢
In speaking of the origin of the use of
signs it must never be forgotten that in
past times they were not confined, as now,
almost exclusively to. public houses, says
the Liverpool Post. We have stUl the
sign of the pole for a barber, the black
boy for a tobacconist, the rod and fish
for a tackle dealer, the golden balls for a
pawnbroker, and some others; but for
merly almost all houses of business dis
played their signs, just as Inns and
taverns do now. Evidence of this fact -is
afforded by the imprint of almost any old
book published in the seventeenth cen
tury. Such books were generally either
printed or sold by an individual dwelling
at the White Hart, the Red Lion, the
Green Dragon, the Golden Tun, or some
such sign. Most of Shakespeare's works,
it may be noted, were first issued from
above, and situated In or near to St.
Paul's churchyard. The various devices
used as signs are of infinite variety and
varying degree of Interest,' from the
heads, or portraits, of modern political
naval or military celebrities, to such
signs as the Rose and Crown, the Fluer
de-Lys, the Spread Eagle, the Cross Keys,
our numerous arms, fantastically colored
animals of all . kinds, and many other
similar devices. Signs of the former kind
require little .or, no explanation; they are
usually modern and uninteresting vulgar
isms,: and their meanings are self-ap
parent. With signs . of the latter class,
however. - the .; case Is generally far dlf-
Xerent, and a search for their original sig-
Trade Signs.
The New York woman cashier who traveled the prim
rose path, struck life only in the high places/squandered
money and was. generally a^ "good fellow," ended her
erratic career as a defaulter in the sum of thirty-seven thou
sand dollars. It is only occasionally that the gentler sex
will consent to pose as an awful example to giddy youth;
but when it does it shines superbly in comparison.
The statistics of the army subsistence
department show some interesting sources
of supply. San Francisco supplied the
largest portion of the articles of the ra
tion and many sales stores. Chicago fur
nished the bulk of the salt meat and meat
products, while Kansas City and Omaha
were also drawn upon for packing-house
products. St. Louis furnished a few
articles which that market could most
economically supply. New York furnished
the ' greater portion of the articles for
sales to officers and enlisted men. The
policy of the subsistence department is to
purchase in the most advantageous mar
ket, considering cost and quality and the
Interests of the Government, and always
favors the home or local market, every
thing being equal. In pursuance of Â¦ this
policy the following articles were pur
chased at Manila: French beef, fresh mut
ton, rice, potatoes, onions, teas, issue
sugar, ice, matches, butter, cheese, cigars,
clotheslines, ginger ale. Australian milk.

The Call regrets that its literary page
for next week Is already in the forms, for
otherwise It would be delighted to place
the following- remarkable contribution,
from an unknown poet. In tho forefront of
the literary gems of the age:
THE defeat of Mr. Johnson in Ohio, his overwhelming
failure to spread himself over that State, to inoculate it
with the fads of which he proposed to make Cleveland
the victim, has a greater significance than an ordinary politi
cal reverse. He had made himself the chief champion of a
revolution in the function and purpose of government by
proposing that public ownership. and administration of all
public utilities should extend from municipalities to the Fed
eral Government itself.
In the course of his propaganda he rejected all precaution
and safeguard. Experience has shown the wisdom of the
law of Massachusetts, which is the law of England, that when
municipal ownership of a public utility is undertaken it must
begin by taking over to public ownership first the private
plant of that utility already in existence. This is in con
formity to justice. It is against public policy to destroy pri
vate property and obliterate capital invested without compen
sation, and it is unsafe for the more expensive public admin
istration of a utility to enter into competition with a more
economically managed private property. In addition to this
wholesome safeguard of the public interest is the other prim
itive and necessary obligation to leave the general fund of a
city free from the imposition of any burden imposed by pub
lic ownership of a public utility. This can be done only by
making the bonds that create such utility a lien on the plant
and not on the taxpayers.
But in these two prime principles Mr. Johnson threw all
prudence and caution to the winds and proposed to plunge
cities, States and the Federal Government into public owner
ship in competition with existing private plants and to put
the financial burden upon the taxpayers and not upon the
plants, Â¦ -
Fortunately Ohio had the benefit of sore experience in
public ownership in Xenia, Columbus, Toledo and other
cities, and while Johnson was callous to the lesson the people
heeded it and wisely took it as a. guide. They rejected him
with a majority that should jolt even him back to a condi
tion of business sense.
The result is useful' here, where so many theorists are en
thusiastic to the verge of fanaticism on the subject of public
ownership. The known evils of private ownership were in
favorable contrast in Ohio with the known evils of public
ownership, and the people of .that. State will settle back to
the conservative position of wise and honest public regula
tion of public utilities .in private ownership and will, not
embark upon municipal trading except under the necessary
conditions of absence of competition and freedom of the tax
payer from any burden undertaken in behalf of public owner
ship. -
TOO MUCH JOHNSON.
Having discovered to her own satisfac
tion that ants are the breeders and dis
seminating agents of all noxious mi
crobes which destroy life, there Is In the
city a woman who sits for hours dally on
the hillsides of the Western Addition col
lecting ants. This lady carries two fruit
jars with her when she starts out to make
her collections. Into one jar she will
place the white ants and into the other
the brown ones. These little mites of
creation she picks up by the aid of a
pair of tweezers and places In the Jars.
When tired out with her laborious task
she returns to her home and empties the
contents of the Jars Into two larger fruit
jars, which she corks with glass stoppers,
thus confining the agents of life destroy
ers. In her hallucination on this subject
she believes that the white ants poison
the lungs and bring on tuberculosis, while
the brown ones convey typhoid and other
fevers destructive to the human family.
Her reason for placing them In the jars
and keeping them in confinement is that
it is the only way in which they are con
trolled and prevented from disseminating
the poison they contain. If burned, she
holds, the germs would be equally as de
structive In dust and ashes. How long
the demented woman has been engaged
in this harmless pastime is not known,
further than that the accumulation of
ants which she has collected fills four
quart jars.
A Friend of Mankind.
"That's what I did," flippantly retorted
the editor as he touched the bell. He was
yanked out of his chair and for five min
utes the indignant citizen mopped the
floor with him and finished by throwing
him In a heap In a corner.
A few minutes after the indignant citi
zen had left the bodyguard returned. He
pulled the editor to his feet and was
greeted with the remark in a feeble voice:
"Where in thunder have you been?
You're docked three dollars."
Happy In the consciousness that he was
amply protected against personal violence,
the editor continued to sling mud and
party feeling ran high. He received sev
eral calls from outraged citizens, but thÂ©
bodyguard was always there at the tinkle
of the bell and saved him from punish
ment. The bodyguard fully earned his
salary of $3 per day.
No demand for retraction had been
made for two days and the bodyguard
thought he would have time to Join a
friend for half an hour in a saloon a few
doors from the newspaper office. While
he was gone an indignant citizen entered
the sanctum, and pulling a copy of the
paper out of his pocket, pointed to an
article and sternly asked: "Did you write
that?"
A well-known newspaper man got tired
of the strenuous life of the city and ac
cepted the position of editor of a paper
in a mining town. It was just prior to
an election and his instructions were to
sling mud, and lots of it. at the opposi
tion candidates. At his request he was
supplied with a bodyguardâ a big, strap
ping Irishman, whose duty it was to sit
outside the sanctum while a visitor was
paying his respects to the editor and rush
in when he heard the editor's bell ring.
Mistakes Will Happen.
According to the most moderate calcu
lations the crystalline mountains sur
rounding the Mississippi basin on the
north and east (which constitute the old
est land in the world) began their work
of filling up the Mississippi basin about
30,000,000 years ago, and all that time has
been necessary to prepare America for Its
present remarkable leaps in civilization.
If In times past the same rate of erosion
has been in progress that is going on now
1.500,000 cubic miles of sediment has been
handled In this work of preparation. This
would make a mountain twenty mileÂ«
wide and a mile high and ' 75 000
miles long, or enough to reach around
the world three times. Great as Is the
amount â¢ of sedimentary rocks in the
world, so industrious and efficient are the
running streams dt water that it is cai
culated by Alfred Russell Wallace that
the entire work of its removal and deposi
tion could easily have been accomplished
in the limits set above to geological time
â¢>- â¢-. -â¢
What is going on thus at the present
time helpfl us to appreciate the vast ex
tent of similar work which was accom
plished during the long geologic ages. In
early geological time the whole Missis
sippi Valley, from the Rocky Mountains
to the Adirondacks, and the range of
\Archean rocks, extending southward to
North Carolina, was a vast open sea,
into which were pouring rivers from the
land on the east and the north which had
already risen above the sea. TheÂ«e
rivers, like those already described at the
present time, were bearing into this Â«ea
their burdens of sediment and spreading
it out over the bottom until It became
full. The Mislsslppi is but continuing- this
work in filling up the Gulf of Mexico. All
the rocks of the Mississippi Basin are of
sedimentary origin. Their total thickness
Is many thousand feet. The different
etrata lie one upon another, like the
leaves of a book, each containing some
fossil marks of life to indicate its relative
age.
The Euphrates and Tigris have filled up
the head of th e Persian Gulf with their
rediment until Ur of the Chaldes, the
former residence of Abraham, is now
seventy or eighty miles Inland. The delta
of the Mississippi is more than 200 miles
Jong, and, on the average, sixty miles
wide, covering 12.000 square mllfs; while
the deposits of the river are pushing it
out into the Gulf of Mexico one mile far
ther every sixteen years. Toward the
lower p ar t of it? course this sediment is
known to be several hundred feet In
<3frpth. The extensive plains of Eastern
and Southern China are all deposit* of the
Hoangbo and Yangste-Kiang. Outside
of the glaciated region in the northern
hemisphere all lake basins, with few ex
crptlons, have been filled to the brim with
pediment brought into them by incoming
streams, while in the glaciated region,
Â¦where the lifetime of the lakes has been
much shorter, they have been largely
filled with sediment, and so , are under
going a rapid process of extinction. The
Â¦western half of Lake Erie, for example,
will be converted Into solid land in a
few thousand years.
â¢ .""> â¢'. , â¢
The rapidity with which these accumu
lations of sediment take place is some
what astonishing. Within historic times
w know that many famous cities which
were once seaports are now far inland.
The city of Adria. in Northern Italy,
wheih was at the beginning of the Chris
tian era so famous a seaport that it gave
its name to the Adriatic Sea, is now six
teen miles inland, the Po and the Adige
having extend**! their deltas that distance
since the city became famous. Paoto. on
â¢ he Peiho, 5n China, was on the shore of
ti*m Yellow Sea 200 B. C. It is now forty
mi!e>s inland. A* late as 500 A. D. the sea
was eighteen miles nearer Tientsin than
it is no*. All along the head of the Tel
low Sea, into which great Chinese rivers
are flowing, c^he land is gaining on the
water at the } rate of about 100 feet per
annum. In approaching Shanghai, across
this pea. one rmeets the turbid water along
a clearly marked line forty or fifty miles
out from the ghore. So sharp is this line
that in crossing It half of the ship would
Â¦till be In the blue ocean water while the
other half is Wunging Into water made
turbid by the fent brought down by the
Hoangho.
When the question arises. What becomes
of all this sediment which is transported
Into the sea? the answer is not difficult to
find. The wash of the hills is constantly
being ppread out over the bottom of the
lakes, the bays and the seas into which
the rivers empty, Â¦where are accumulating
the beds of mud, sand, gravel and peb
bles which under proper conditions may
he transformed into elatestone. sandstone
and conglomerate rock, while the lime
held in solution is furnishing material out
of which corals and fhellfish of various
kinds will construct th^ir personal habi
tations and leave thorn to form vast beds
of limestone rock.
Among the ecti\-e but often despised
agencies assisting running water in its
work of planing down the continents an
pleworms have a prominent place. This
they do by preparing the material and
making it accessible. Darwin has dis
cussed their work in a very Interesting
and conclusive manner. According to his
estimates there are on the average 26,000
angleworms to the acre, weighing 17b
pounds. So active are these animals In
working over the surface soil that they
annually to the surface about seven
tons of solid material, which is in condi
tion to be easily washed away by the fall
ing rains. From this it can be learned
that wÂ«e should not de?pise the day of
f?ma}l' things, nor forget when we tread
en a worm that we are destroying an Im
portant geological agency. Numerous
other aids In preparing material for water
transportation exist, such as various
other forms of animal and vegetable life,
and the action of heat and cold In pulver
izing the rocks and of Ice In starting them
from their foundations. But these deserve
treatment by themselves and we will for
the present pass them by.

A proper, comprehensive and comprehensible exhibit of
San Francisco at St.. Louis is a master step in the processes
by which we can draw to us the international enterprise of
the world and fix upon us the permanent attention of our
own hinterland. ...
The raised map proposed by Mr. Mills is a capital feature
as a foundation. The eye is caught by that which is graphic.
It prepares the mind for the study of details which are largely
statistical. In the same line is the moving picture, which
fascinates and attracts beyond any other method of graphic
illustration. By that means we can show the crowds and
life of our streets, the movement of" ships on the bay, the
flowing tide of trade on our docks; our industries in motion,
not only on our wharves and in our warehouses and manu
factories can be exhibited, but our rural industries, our lum
bering, mining and our harvests can be cast in motion upon
the screen. In like manner we can show our moral and edu
cational position among the cities of the world. The
church and school going crowds can move on the canvas to
show our devotion to the higher things of life, and as a back
ground our church and school architecture. As practically
a part of the life of this city our two universities can be en
listed in such an exhibit, and Berkeley on the campus and
Stanford on the quadrangle will make an impressive feature
in the great panorama.
With unity of effort this- city can make an impression that
nothing will efface. We will enjoy the advantage, too, of
having in every audience that will see it people who have
visited us. Our position on the highway around the world
has brought here in transit vast numbers from every nation,
largely of that class which will go to ft. Louis. Hundreds of
thousands of our own countrymen have seen us in our
actual life. No graphic illustration of this city can be shown
without meeting the vision of some of these, who will be our
vocal advertisers to certify, to all who hear, the fidelity of the
picture.
We should by no means omit to implead our climate. With
the facilities offered by Golden Gate Park and many of our
fine private grounds we should justify our claim of being a
winterless land by showing the January aspect of nature, the
tropical and semi-tropical flora that flourish here, the palms
and the bamboo and others which to all men express clem
ency of climate and the absence of harshness and rigor dur
ing the winter months. Such an exhibit gives vitality to the
official records of our temperature and sunshine.
Urged forward with energy this exhibit can give imperial
prominence to San Francisco and make this the most attract
ive city that will be before the world's eye at that great
parliament of combined civilization. P;^-:
THE mercantile bodies of this city have taken highly
commendable action to secure a proper exhibition of
our place in the commercial geography of the world
and of the use we have thus far made of our advantages.
There is much evidence that the geographical position of
a city is not all there is in determining its fate and future.
The trade relations of the Atlantic seaboard being with
Europe, New York has not the best location to take advan
tage of them. That was an attribute of Boston and that city
had a long start of- New York. But the hinterland of a city
plays a great part in its rise and progress. The building
of the Erie canal gave New York a direct connection with
the interior by a water line extending from the Hudson
River to the great lakes. It tapped for her the whole basin
east of the Mississippi River and made the shores of Lakes
Erie, Michigan and Superior her hinterland. As rapidly as
settlement overtook the wilderness in all that region its sur
plus products drained through the water line of communica
tion and the great point of exchange was established in
New York City, whose supremacy was assured by that con
quest of the transportation to her warehouses of the com
merce of a vast region.
Before railroads were thought of as practicable rivals of
waterways New York was advanced beyond any possible
rivalry. Boston, situated nearer to Europe with ample sea
port facilities, could not get to the West by water and drop
ped hopelessly behind her great rival. When railroads were
built they naturally sought such a placement as would enable
them to compete for trade already established, and every one
aimed at New York as its seaboard terminus. In the fur
ther development of her transportation system New York
tapped her rivals by rail, and Boston, Philadelphia and Balti
more became contributors to her supremacy and depended
upon commercial connection with her facilities for their own
progress.
It is shown beyond dispute by Mr. W. H. Mills that when
the isthmian canal is built San Francisco instead of losing
by her position will gain. We cannot penetrate our hinterland
beyond the mountains by canal, but we already reach it by
rail, and we should co-operate in fellowship and with
eager earnestness with our existing and all proposed railway
systems in every project that brings every point of commer
cial advantage in our transalpine region within reach of this
city by rail. Federal irrigation is to extend production in
that region. It is to plant productive farms where now is
the desert. It is to build towns, incite manufactures and
create industry which must have for its output an outlet by
sea. We should leave no expedient untried that will make
San Francisco that outlet. Our great commerce in the fu
ture is to be Asiatic. Let this city be to that trade what
New -York is to the trade of Europe. Let us attract hither
the international merchants and financiers, whose enterprise
seeks all over the planet the foci of commerce, on every con-
"The party broke up* In a hurry, but
several months later the couple again
appeared before the minister and all went
merry as a marriage bell until the hus
band-to-be was asked if he took the lady
to be his lawful wedded wife. No doubt
as a measure of retaliation he said 'No/
and when pressed for the reason said:
'Well, I've taken a sudden dislike to her/
"The couple patched up their differences
and once more repaired to the minister,
and this time they each agreed to take
the other for life partners.
"At this point the minister said: 'Well,
you can both go home, for I will not
marry you.' The surprised couple there
upon asked the reason for the minister's
decision and the latter replied: "Well.
I've taken a sudden dislike to both of
you.' "
"Probably the queerest matrimonial
venture that ever came to my notice."
said "Cupid" Danforth, the marriage
license man, "was that of the couple who
made three ineffectual attempts to get
married on tho same marriage license and
then gave it up in disgust. When the
couple came to me for the license they
both acted In a rather excited manner
and the young girl appeared to be an un
willing party to the proceedings. How
ever, they went away with the license
and the sequel to the affair was told to
me afterward by the minister who was
asked to tie the nuptial knot.
"It appears that the couple went
through the ceremony without a hitch
up to the time that the lady was asked:
'Do you take this man to be your wedded
husband?' After a long pause the lady
sharply said 'No.' When asked for her
reason she replied: 'Well, you see, I've
taken a sudden dislike to him.'
Comedy of Matrimony.
MORMON COURAGE.
Polygamy is an expression of social atavism, the recur
rence to a past and lower type. No doubt polygamy was a
great improvement upon the casual and entirely promiscuous
system which preceded it. But in the evolution of morals
and civilization monogamy has superseded it and a step back
ward is unthinkable.
The apostles may be sure of this, that no temporizing of
politicians, nor moral laxness, no desire for peace will per
manently restrain the American people from applying the
besom of their wrath to sweep polygamy out of Utah, though
to do it the doors of the temple have to be opened by can
non and the secret ceremonies behind its walls have to be
baned by the law. -hlX'-'
Whn Senator Frank Cannon, a Mormon monogamist, was
a candidate for re-election his church opposed him. This
opposition nagged him to desperation, and in a speech in
Salt Lake he denounced the hierarchy of his church for bad
faith with the Union in regard to polygamy. Of course that
cut him off from all chance of political preferment in Utah.
But it was a voice from the inside, an utterance from behind
the secret ceremonies of the church, that lie behind the
locked doors of the beautiful temple that is closed to all but
the faithful. Now the lapse of time, the constitutional inde
pendence of Statehood, success in controlling the politics of
Utah and Idaho and the hope to soon do the same in
Wyoming and Nevada and in New Mexico and Arizona, have
made the church bold, and Apostle Grant does not scruple
to confirm the charge of- Senator Cannon.
It presents a serious issue. It is. quite difficult to get the
American politician to consider an abstract question of mor
als as more important than the success of his party at the
next election. We are familiar with all the arguments in
favor of polygamy, that was divinely ordained for the Jews
and is the natural condition of man, and that the vices of a
monogamous people are pleaded as its excuse. The answer
is that the monogamous nations are the strong nations.
Among them art and science and civilization have had their
latest rise and their greatest advance. The polygamous and
polyandrous people? have halted in the march and lag hope
lessly behind. All this is in spite of the handicap of vice
and incontinence of which the Mormons have preached so
glibly.
The polygamous Mormons who were punished under the
Tucker-Edmunds law filed a valid claim to the respect of
men by frank admission of their guilt of plural marriage,
their patient acceptance of punishment, their obedience to
the law by selecting one wife and"their provision for the care
of the others and of their children. That feeling of respect,
deepening in some cases into sympathy, was the cause of the
tolerant sentiment which enabled the admission of Utah into
the Union. The first presidency of the church proclaimed
the end of polygamy, and it seemed as though the Mormon
community had put itself in line" with the sentiment of the
Union. Everybody was pleased to believe the issue closed,
for there is much about the Mormons, as a class and individ
ually, to attract the respect of their fellow citizens, and all
good men were glad that the obstacle to the free play of that
respect had been removed.
IT is an interesting coincidence that our reference to the
Mormon church in politics and its desire to fortify
polygamy by colonizing and controlling the intermoun
tain States was concurrent with the pro-polygamous speech
of Apostle Grant to the alumni of Utah University.., He
boasted frankly of his two wives and of his ambition to make
it three. - v./-;^'- ;V-Â£tf
But perhaps, after all, Jhe most remark
able and interesting thing about the cells
is that despite their Infinitesimal size and
stupendous number each Is a separate and
to some extent an independent being.
Each is a living creature, which is born,
grow*, reaches its prime, does its work,
reproduces others like itself and then dies.
Each cell has Its special duty, and In the
performance of that duty displays a cer
tain amount of what must be called In
telligence.
But the history of the individual cell,
birth, growth, reproduction and death,
we will discuss In another article.
To look at a tooth, for instance, one
would imagine It to be a solid, homogen
eous maps. Examined under a micro
scope, however, we find the tooth to be no
more homogeneous than a brick wall, be
ing constructed of hexagonal prisms
standing on end and firmly cemented to
gether, and presenting a surface not un
like a tiled floor. Those prisms are ar
ranged eo as to beet withstand the me
chanical strains to which they are sub
ject. They are so minute that It would
take many thousands of them placed end
to end to extend a distance of one inch.
The mucous membrane which, beginning
at the eyelids, nostrils, lips and other or
ifices of the body, lines its entire internal
surface, seems to the unaided eight and
touch a perfectly firm, smooth surface.
Kxamined under a microscope, however,
the mucous membrane is seen to consist
of cells of various shapes, arranged in
a kind of pavement ' like cobblestones,
Belgian blocks or tiling. .
The skin is closely allied to the mucous
membrane; in fact, both are formed of
what are called epithelial cells, modified
to suit their differing requirements. The
skin consists of several layers of epithe
lial cells, the outermost layer being called
the epidermis or cuticle, the Inner the
true skin or cutis. This lower layer of
the skin consists of living cells, which
are constantly being reproduced. These
cells as they grow older are pushed up
ward and outward by the newborn cells
beneath. The cuticle or outer skin, there
fore, consists merely of the dead or dying
epithelial cells, which have been displaced
by their own ungrateful offspring. In the
last stage of mummification these cells
are thrown off from the surface of the
skin. Friction or strain of any kind causes
the cells to retain their vitality longer,
hence the ekin at such points is thicker,
as. for instance, at the palm of the hand
and the sole of the foot.
* ' } *
To describe even thy little known about
the cells and their a^ivlties would fill a
volume. It may b* '.id briefly that each
organ and strue*-' t- of the body is com
posed of some jpu '?ular kind or kinds of
cells, the fot,n A^ vvhich is that best
adapted to thf work, to be done. Thus in
the teeth, as we have seen, and In bone
we have solid, brlckllke structures, firm
ly cemented into place, in the mucous
membrane an elastic pavement or tiling
and in the skin a complex system of self
renewing pavement, beautifully adapted
to meet the varied requirements of a pro
tective covering, a basis for the Insertion
of hair follicles and tactive nerve endings,
and a medium through which certain
glands, many millions in number, may
pour out through tiny tubes their secre
tions filtered from the blood.
The cell doctrine, In a word, Is the re
alization that all living bodies, both an
imal and vegetable, probably mineral,
too, for that matter, are merely clusters
of infinitely minute bodies, called cells.
These cells are for the most part so small,
so delicate and so translucent that they
can be studied only by one fully equipped
with microscope and other apparatus,
chemicals for staining and some degree
of technical skill. Therefore it is quite
natural that the average reader is sur
prised to learn that his body is no more
homogeneous than a stone house, a tiled
pavement or a river full of floating logs.
Naturally man's first conception of his
own body was that of a solid, non-divisi
ble organism. Just so the child's first
idea of a brick house is that it Is a solid
homogeneous whole. Later he learns that
the brick house is in reality a mass of
small particles fitted together and so
making up a perfect whole. And in the
same manner man, studying his own and
ether bodies with the old microscope, dis
covered m the early part of the last cen
tury that certain parts of the body were
made up of smaller bodies. And from
this modest beginning grew that splendid
system now known as the cell doctrine.
Tnunlty, Is one thing. In the truest sense
the body Is not one, but manyâ a compos
ite made up of millions of millions of
Email particles. These particles are called
cells. The body which seems bo solid and
indivisible is, in reality, nothing more nor
less than a mass of cells; and the life of
the body In all Its many manifestations
is merely the result of the aggregate ac
tivities of the cells forming It. So far
from being a solid unit the body may
rather be likened to a vast army of work
ers divided into regiments and corps, each
division having its special duty. Each
division Is composed of countless millions
of individuals. Take, for instance, the
carriers of the body, the erythrocytes, or
red blood cells, each of which is 1-3200 of
an Inch in diameter. In a cubic inch of
blood there are 70,000,000,090 of these min
ute bodies. In the body at any one time
there are about thirty millions of mil
lions (30,000,000,000,000) of these workers.
So much for one of the smallest of these
divisions!

r A Great Work,
One of the most extensive, successful
and Interesting philanthropies In the
world is that conducted by Dr. Barnardo
in London. Dr. Barnardo is devoting his
life to the rescue and training of destitute
children. He Is the executive head of a
great incorporated society, founded by
himself, which has dealt with over 50.000
street waifs. The society receives only
children who are absolutely destitute. Tho
children are trained In the society's homes
or placed In private families. A careful
record Is kept of the career of every child,
and the books of the society show that
an overwhelming majority of the rescued
Â¦waifs become self-supporting, respectable
members of society. The records show
that less than 3 per cent of the children
go to the'bad, 10 per cent fall to maintain
themselves, 30 to 40 per cent become trust
worthy servants or laborers, 40 per cent
become successful farmers or mechanics
and 6 to 10 per cent enter the professions.
These figures furnish convincing proof of
the social value of Dr. Barnardo's rescue
work.

Application has been recently made by
A. H. Gilmore, formerly business man
ager of one of the papers at Newport
News, to cover an Invention worked out
by that gentleman by which he says
he can Increase the speed of steam ves
sels by about double at one-half tfie
operating cost. He proposes to put the
propellers In the bow instead of the
stern. This will necessitate some
change In the lines of such boats as com
pared with those at present in vogue, and
until his ideas are fully protected by pat
ents, Mr. Gilmore refuses to give the de
tails. He says: "It Is a well-known fact
that it is easier to pull a cart than to puÂ»n
it. Why does not the same apply to ves
sels? I know that it does. I have experi
mented with a small craft in the waters
around Newport News and have found
that there are excellent grounds for my
statement." After securing his patent*
Mr. Gilmore will Immediately arrange for
the construction of a boat on the lines of
his Invention and make public demonstra

The letter in part is as follows:
It is hoped that a strong representation of
California dairymen may fce made in St. Louis
and that the dairymen of California may meet
the delegates to the National Butter-makers'
Association at the St. Louis convention and ini
prefs upon them the desirability of California
for 1905. If the number of those desiring to go

SOCIETY PAYS
RESPECTS TO
NEW ARRIVALS
John Demanne, a waiter, who has been
employed in the various French restau
rants in the city, while a passenger on the
steamer Redondo, bound from Los An
geles, became suddenly Insane and tried
to commit suicide. He was restrained by
Captain Tallaksen until the vessel arrived
in this city, when he was turned over to
the authorities. He will be examined by
Dr. McGettigan this morning. He Is now
confined in a cell at the detention hospital
for the Insane at the City Hall.
Passenger Becomes Insane.
E. A. Er.gleberg. a lumber dealer of
this city, and who until two years ago
was vice president of the of Till
mann & Bendel, was arrested at the ferry
building last evening while attempting
to murder his wife. The lumberman had
drawn a revolver and was about to use
it when Policeman James Cook seized
his hand and prevented a tragedy. En
gleberg was then taken Into custody and
two charges were entered against him at
the Central Police stationâ one of as
sault to murder and another of carrying
concealed weapons. Engleberg had two
weapons on his person and was drunk.
Engleberg married his present wife
about twelve years ago. She was a Mr6.
Dugan For some time they have been
residing in Sausalito. Life during the
last few years, has not been tranquil,
owing to the fact that both drank. Yes
terday Mrs. Engleberg came to the city
in the morning and her husband fol
lowed her about noon. He consumed
much, liquor during the afternoon and
says he followed his wife about the city
and to* the ferry as she was about to
catch the 5:15 boat.
Policeman Cook's attention was first
attracted by a woman's shriek. lie ob
served Mrs. Engleberg rushing In- the
direction of the gate and an instant aft
erward her husband rushed after her.
Cook started toward the -pair and saw
Engleberg draw a revolver from his
pocket, point it at the woman and try
to seize her. Then the policeman grasped
his hand and disarmed him. Mrs. Engle
berg cried that her husband had another
weapon, and when he was searched this
Â¦was found to be true. From a conver
sation which followed in angry tones the
cause of the difficulty was learned.
Engleberg told the policeman he had
followed his wife during the day and had
found her In the company of other men.
This exasperated him and he proposed to
kill her. At the City Prison he attributed
all of the difficulty to drunkenness. Mrs.
Engiebcrg insisted upon being left alone,
snd teÂ»!d the policeman that she proposed
to separate from her husband and would
shortly bring action for divorce. She was
permitted to go on her way, and took
the next boat for Sausalito.
The robbers then ran down Sutter
street, followed by their victim, who wÂ«.s
shouting an alarm. Policeman Brady re
sponded first, then several other guar
dians of the peace answered police whis
tles, and before several blocks had been
covered an excited mob rushed after the
highwaymen. The latter turned Into
Montgomery street and after quite a race
succeeded in disappearing down California
street. A thorough search was made of
the neighborhood, but they could not be
found. The police have good descriptions
of the two men.
According to the story told by Dr. Far
ley, he went into one of the saloons on
Grant avenue about 2 o'clocK in the morn
ing with a friend to get a drink. He no
ticed that two nesroes observed him when
he took a purse from his back pocket and
extracted sufficient money to pay the bar
tender. After he left the place the ne
groes followed, and when he had gone but
a short distance they caught up with him.
Their first request was for 25 cents with
which to purchase supper. This request
wa.s refused, whereupon the two thieves
crowded him into a doorway and took the
purse from his pocket.
Two burly negroes held up and robbed
Dr. J. Farley of S19 Market street near
the corner of Grant avenue and Sutler
street early yesterday morning. After
theÂ«crime had been committed the phy
sician pursued the thieves for several
blocks, and the chase became txcitlng
after several police officers and many citi
zens had joined In it. The robbers made
their escape on Montgomery street. The
detective department now has charge of
the case.

The day's work opened at 10:25 a. m. in

to o!T-;r the prayer.
The address of welcome was given by
Mrs. A. E. osbourne. vice president of the
..:.-irict. Mrs. Osbournes words reflected
a charming personality, as well as a close
sympathy with and knowledge of the
clubs of her district. Then followed the

made a charming reply, and thus were

Mrs. Lang followed him several blocks.
She reported the matter to the police
and gave them a good description of the
man.
She rushed back to find the purse and
claims she saw a young man yick it up.
Although she accused him of having
picked up the purse hÂ«Â» refused to return
anything but a memorandum book whicb
was in the purse. He denied having found
anything else.
She reported the matter to the police.
The bag contained jewelry valued at
$1500, comprising six gold rings with dia
monds, pearls, opals and ; emeralds; a
diamond and pearl brooch, several gold
baby buttons and an order for $25 en the

Mrs. William Lang of 1710 Golden Gate

A hurried search failed to reveal the
missing article. , No one was in sight but
two women runnins for a car. One of
them, Mrs. Duffy says, must have found
the bag, for they were the only ones
around.
Mrs. D. M. Duffy, wife of Attorney

child cried for her chatelaine bag. She
gave it to the baby and proceeded a

How Coffee Sets Its Grip and" Is
Never Suspected.
Jt is surprising how many people never
suspect that coffee la causing all their
trouble until they are finally knocked out
or some disease caused by coffee has be-
come chronic and almost incurable.
Even In chronic cases the chances are
a shift from coffee to Postum Food Coffee
will build the eick one up and In time ef.
feet a cure.
Sometimes this happens with surprising
promptness. A lady of Syracuse, Neb.,
rays: "LaFt eprtng a year ago my doctor
to'.d me I would have to stop drinking
coffee. I had heart trouble bo bad that
the least excitement would cause me to
choke up so I could scarcely get my
treath, and I was so nervous I could not
bear to have the children move around
the house.
"Doctor told my husband to gret Postum
for me, but before he did bo we moved to
the country ar.d I fell back on milk and
water, but even such exertion as climb-
ing a Cight of stains caused my heart to
f:urt me bo I would feel sick and faint.
"This continued all summer, until In tha
fall we eg-ain moved to Syracuse. There I
;ct 8omePc*tura and began to feel so much
setter after using one package that I con-
Mnued Its use altogether, and I am now
oetter In health than I have ever been
:>efore in eight years. I am stronger and
3eshier than I evr-r was and have not had
the headacha but three times since I be-
fan to use Postum a year ago. The
thanga certainly eeemB wonderful, for I
save had no return of the heart trouble
it all, and I never get tired telling what
Postum has done for me." Name given
>y Postum Co., Battle Creek, Mich.

shifted, causing her to list heavily to
starboard and adding considerably to the
vesse-1's danger.
Henry B. Hyde's Cargo Shifts.
Among those examined yesterday was
William Hughes, seaman. His testimony
was in the main a verification of that giv
en by the officers. He bears out Ravens
in his statement that four people were
lost by the capsizing of the starboard
boat. He says the boat was made fast
after it capsized, but he did not know
who let the boat go adrift. He says the
engines were going ahead and corrobo
rates the statements of Bruce, the first
officer, that the after tackle of the port
hoa"t jammed and caused it to capsize.
Still he admitted that if the ship., had not
been moving at the time of the launching
the boats would have been launched suc
cessfully. Hughesjstated that the weather
wa.s moderate, the fog thick.
Thomas Pizzotri, the second assistant en
gineer, testified that no bell was given to
stop the vessel after she struck. He saw
the starboard boat capsize and was sure
there were some people in it at the time.
He said that the ship was going ahead
when the boats were launched, running
perhaps five or six knots an hour. He
verifies the second mate's statement that
the painter was made fast and thought
that it was Fred Johansen who did it.
John Riemer, seaman, testified that he
was in the bow of the port boat and saw
Mate Bruce put life belts on the women.
He said the captain did everything In his
power to get back to the ship and save
the lives of those in the water, but was
unable to do so, having but one oar to
row with. Before they could rig up the
boat's mast as an oar the vessel was out
of sight.
Reimer said he did tricks at the wheel
and generally steered "off shore" by the
captain's orders.
. Charles Blombak, a seaman, proved a
poor witness. He knew very little about
shipimatters. He answered questions stu
pidly. .All that -the inspectors were able
to giban from his talk was the fact that
the weather wes moderate, the fog thick
and that he had heard Second Officer Ra
vens tell men to get In the starboard
boat and to hold her away from the
ship's side. . ../.â¢-.
Manuel Pethlmanis, chief cook, threw
little light on the investigation. He had
never "known his station in case of dis
aster, but was sure that he saw Mate
Bruce place life belts on the women.
Fred Johansen, the only seaman left to
testify, is the man the inspectors most de
sire to hear from. He was at, the star
board boat at the time of its launching
and Is said to be the man who made it
fast by the painter, and he may be able
to tell how.it got loose. He will be sub
penaed to appear on Monday, j After his
testimony the ground will be gone over,
the ; facts made known and the blame
placed where it belongs.
The discrepancies between the reports
and the testimony are many, and when
these men are again placed on the stand
the -truth will doubtless be forced from
them.
The main line of investigation next
week will be based upon the written re
ports of the officers made prior to the in
vestigation, and their testimony on the
stand.
Did the second officer really have nine
men on his raft, as he said in his report?
or is he trying to protect himself from
culpability for the loss of the four pas
sengers from the starboard boat by con
tradicting his report? or were these men
lost from his raft and not from the star
board boat?
The mass of evidence taken at the in
vestigation has been but a series of ad
missions and contradictions. All endeav
ors to find out who launched the star
board boat and who was responsible for
her getting away have proved fruitless.
Those examined knew nothing about it,
for most of them were on some other part
of the ship when this occurrence hap
pened. No one seems to have been near.
The testimony of the seamen has been
irrelevant and each man examined showed
a tendency to shield his superior officers.
The time consumed in the investigation
has given the ship's crew time to get a
hint of the inspectors' line of investiga
tion and fortify themselves against ad
missions that would tend to incriminate
themselves.
The questions now confronting the in
spectors are how the ship came to run
ashore and whether or not Ravens is
truthful when he says there were four
passengers lost from the starboard boat?
It is not believed that there were more
than thirty-nine men on board when the
ship struck. Ravens says there were
nine men on his raft. Four of them, in
cluding himself, were seamen and were
saved. The other five, who, he says, were
passengers whom no one knew. They
were lost.
Second Mate Ravens said In his report
that he launched the starboard lifeboat,
but in his .testimony he contradicted him
self by saying that it was never launched.
He claims that when the boat capsized
four passengers were thrown out and
drowned. Figuring these men with the
others on board brings the ship's list to
forty-three passengers.
The facts most apparent thus far are
that the vessel was running ahead almost
at full speed when the boats' were launch
ed; that the women had life preservers
on; that the weather was mild, though
the fog was thick.
It has also been shown that both life
boats were capsized, and that if they had
not been launched while the ship was
plowing through the sea they could have
b'een launched successfully.
Mate Bruce says he gave the engineer
a bell to stop as soon as the vessel struck,
but Captain Mclntyre and two of Jhe en
gineers had already stated that the ship
was never stopped after she struck.
Thomas Pizzotti, the second assistant en
gineer, yesterday testified that he was in
his room right next to the gong of the
engine-room when the ship struck,' and
that there was no bell to stop the vessel.
The engineer on watch got but one bell,
and that was to slow down.
It Is strongly intimated that charges
of perjury will be preferred by United
States Inspectors Bolles and Bulger
against several of the prjncipal witnesses
that have testified at the South Portland
investigation. That the inspectors have
been badly handicapped in their efforts
to determine the responsibility for the
loss of the vessel is apparent to the most
casual observer, and that the witnesses
have repeatedly contradicted themselves
while testifying is shown by the records.
Some important disclosures may be
looked for when the investigation is re
sumed next week.

Grave anxiety is felt for the British ship
Vanduara. now out flfty-six 'iays from
Puget Sound for San Diego. Three weeks
would be a long time for this voyage.
The Vanduara has been out eight weeks.
Ten per cent reinsurance was paid on her
jegterday. Considering the length of time
she is out this rate is considered ex
tremelv low, and If the vessel is not reÂ«
ported to-day the rate probably will be
advanced a number of points.
The rate of reinsurance on the Will
komroen was reduced to 10 per cent. The-
Charlonus, Verajcan and Paris are also
Quoted at 10 per cent. The Tifeshire re
mains at to and the Daisy at SO per cent.
Three years ago she collided with the
liner Empress of Japan off Flattery. She
was formerly the British ship Blairmore,
which turned turtle two years ago in San
Francisco harbor, drowning some of her
crew.
The bark's hull is not damaged.
Captain Johnston threw several bottled
messages overboard, for he and the crew
did not expect to reach shore. Twenty
hours after the vessel was dismasted the
steamer Vermont was seen. The Pal
mer will be libeled for $30,000 in a sal
vage claim to be made against her by the
Vermont.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 6.â Dismasted
and almost a wreck, the American bark
Abby Palmer, owned in San Francisco,
and twenty-two days out from Honolulu
in ballast, was towed Into port this morn
ing by the British steamer Vermont, load
ed with cargo from Portland for South
America, which picked her, up 140 miles
southwest of Cape Flatten'. She was
drifting helplessly before the wind. The
Palmer ran into a furious gale on Tues
day, which dismasted her.
Jimmy Britt is receiving all sorts of
letters warning him that Charley Seiger,
the "iron man," whom he fights next
Tuesday night under the auspices of the
San Francisco Athletic Club, is a dan
gerous customer in the ring. Britt is
heeding the warning and is redoubling
his efforts to go into the ring in perfect
condition. Jimmy has been working hard
at droll's Gardens, Alameda, and is on
edge. His injured foot does not bother
him. He is fast on his feet and his spar
ring partner is ready to vouch that- Britt
punches harder than ever.
Britt will apparently have his hands
full with Seiger. The Italian is one of
those boxers who is always on top of his
man. He keeps coming all the time and
nothing seems to stop him. Joe Gans
tried to do so and Rufe Turner knocked
him down many times, but the "iron
man" was back again fighting as hard
as ever. It remains to be seen whether
Britt can stop him. There are many peo
ple In this city who believe he cannot.
Seiger is a dangerous man to go against.
He possesses abnormal strength and vi
tality. His punching powers are great.
His sparring partners complain that he
hits too hard and they are delighted to
learn that Seiger will box no more w"hile
training.
The betting on the contest is 10 to 6
with Britt favorite. There will be a large
amount of money put up on both men, as
they have large followings. Seiger has
won many admirers during his stay in
this city. The talent realizes the fact
that he made 133 pounds readily and was
as strong as ever, and they are ready to
place a bet on him.
The preliminary bouts should be inter
esting. Dave Barry, the fighting Irishman,
who is training George Gardner for -his
engagement with Fitzsimmons, is match
ed to go ten rounds with Maxey Kane.
"Spider" Welch and Frank Rafael are
also matched to go ten rounds.
The advance sale of seats is large and
everything points to a big attendance.
Eddie -Graney has been selected referee.
The Emperor's views regarding the ad
vantage of the race, as they have been
outlined to naval officers, are that yachts
of the cruiser type are of greater utility
than racing models, and that the strength
of construction, discipline of the crews,
variations of weather and skill in sailing
under what may be called service condi
tions are best tested in a trans-oceanic
race. The Meteor was constructed par
tially to that end.
Emperor William is said to have liken
ed a racing yacht to a racehorse as "no
good for every day pleasure."
BERLIN, Nov. 6.â Emperor William's
schooner-yacht Meteor will go- to the
United States in the spring to take part
in the ocean yacht race for the Emperor's
cup. Several changes have been ordered
in the Meteor's rig, the most important
of which is reduction of her sail area, so
as to avoid being heavily handicapped.
The Meteor was sailed by an all-English
crew two seasons ago and by a crew
about half-English and German in the
races last season.

The Weekly CalL
61 per Year.NEW YORK. Nw. 6 âThe rtock market wa>
rubmergfcd again to-day under a deluge of
I'nited States Steel stocks. Tbe general list,
however, responded much less readily to the
pressing influence of the steel liquidation than
Â»aÂ« the case yesterday. Whenever thÂ« severe
pressure on the steel stocks was suspended, as
happened at interval*, the railroad stocks ral
lied easily, so that their level of prices was
above lafi night for about as much time as It
was b*low. The market closed In one of the
. Irtervals when there was no pressure on eteei.
to that prices elsewhere were rising and were
well above last night. Union Pacific and Penn
sylvania ibow a gain of a point on the day and
a number of the New York corporation stocks
somewhat more. The early liquidation In the
tneel shares was very violent, as Is shown by
the fact that the rsJen of the prefenM fcr tha
first hour alone were above 100.000 chares. It
1* not to be supposed that this enormous volurr.*
of dealings was wholly liquidated. Tbe room
proff-Miena.1* traded in these stocks on a ve-/
Urre scale ail day. I was said cf one tradff
who man v~y aeUvc Â«n the stock all day thai
be was nettli-r lcnÂ«r r>T short for more than ten
minutes at a timr. sfMto the aggregate of his
Individual dealings amounted to many thou
sands of fharw. The low price touched for the
t common stock was 10%, for the preferred C2.
and for the band* 65%. The relatively greater
weakness of the preferred stock than the bonds
waji noticeable in view of the euppomd conver
sion of operations by ihe syndicate which would
Involve the purchase of preferred Â«tock for con
version into bonrti which would in consequence
be for eale. The heavy felling of the 6teels
*u the expression of a fear that the announced
cut of $4 per ton in the price cf steel billets
waa a preliminary to a reduction of prices of
all thÂ« products and a general process of con
traction throughout the trade. There were
Â«onÂ»e rather epÂ«clfic allegations also that oojne
ef the sailing was traceable to sources from
wtich It/ might be prompted by changes in the
executive department of the corporation. The
stock-market seemed to fÂ»ce with equanimity
trÂ»Â» prospect cf another poor bank showing to
ra^ow. In addition to the losses to the sub
*o*>aiiury of $7,091,000. the banks have made net
" dfc.Pfnent* by Â«5Irect express to the Went and
po'-ih of upward of 13.000.000. Tbe Indicated
r Â»*h decrease of mere than 110.000,000 Is about
eqtfcl to Burp'ue renerve* shown by the banks
Is laet week's statement. Tbe stock market
Mmmanity seemed to rest in a sense of Mcuri
ty that this threatening showing somehow

Two more cars of Eastern Cranberries were
received yesterday. The .demand was fair and
ail descriptions were firmly held. Receipts of
Matinda Strawberries from Watsonvllle were
light probably on account of the recent rain,
and "prices ranged higher. Longworth Straw
berries and Raspberries arrived freely and
brought good prices. Huckleberries were of
fering agalq and met with steady demand.
There was a good demand for fine Apples,
Persimmons and suitably packed Grapes for
shipment on the Honolulu steamer, out to
day, and * the market for those descriptions
was quite active In consequence. Tokay and
Isabella Grapes were steady at the maximum
quotation, while 65c was the top for the other
varieties. Receipts of large open boxes con
tinued light and cleaned up well at firmer
rates. Small quantities of Figs were received,
but attracted very little attention. Stocks of
other deciduous fruits were heavy and prices
Â¦were without quotable change.
Valencia- Oranges are well cleaned up and
firmer. The Honolulu steamer, which sails
to-day, will (take out some large shipments.
New crop Navels are offering at $3@3 M) per
box, but are too green to Invite custom. Limes
and Lemons are plentiful and easy. Ripe Ba
nanas are scarce and firm. The recent arrivals
from Honolulu are still in the cellars and ma

St. Louis Wool Market.
Thers was a temporary scarcity of fine
creamery Butter yesterday, which enabled
those houses carrying light stocks to advance
their prices, which most of them did. Such
houses quoted 31c. But the heavy handlers
did not change their previous quotations, on
the ground that thrrp steamers, one bringing
a double quantity, fall due from the northern
coast between now and Monday, and that there
would be plenty on hand again at the begin
ning of the week. These different procedures
rendered the market more or less nominal, and
made accurate quotations difficult, especially
as some houses, which had no stock to speak
of, quoted even over 31c. The prices quoted
below are as close as the market can be given
at the moment.
CheÂ«s<s continues weak, with heavy supplies.
Dealers still complain of the alow demand
for Eggs. Prices remain unchanged. Receipts

The bÂ«st grades of fresh Batter ar* rather
scarce, but tha abundance of packed -goods
prevents any advance In prices. Cheap grades
are plentiful. Fine ranch Eggs are more plen
tiful than they have be#n for some weeks
and orlces axe rtill lower. Cheese and Honey
stand exactly the same as quoted last week.
Meats, Poultry and Fish are In good supply
and are selling at the familiar quotations.
Game la coming in freely and wild Ducks are
much cheaper.
Seasonable varieties of Fruits and Vege
tables are in normal supply, with price* reas

CBTJELTY. CHABGES PROVED
BY MBS* JENNIE M. BBOWN
NEW YORK. Nov. 6.â Dradstreet'3 to
morrow will say:
Trade and Industry are quieter on the
whole. _ Unseasonable weather affects re
tail trade at many centers, and conserva
tism In providing for future requirements
restricts jobbing trade. Relatively most
activity is found in the South, where the
growth of the cotton movement at. the'
high prices ruling stimulates business at
many centers. In* industrial lines reports
of curtailed production are evidences of
new demand not pressing as sharply as
heretofore. Food products are easing off,
and finished Iron and steel are leading
the downward movement of manufac
tured goods, but signs of reawakening
foreign and domestic demand lead to the
hope that tire automatic check to demand
long exercised will be removed.
Iron and steel cars are active and West
ern jobbers make $3 per ton by filling
orders from store rather than from mill.
Lumber is steady as a whole-
Wheat, Including flour, exports for the
week ending November 5, aggregate 4,340.
281 bushels, against 4.094.S73 bushels last
week and 5,715,555 bushels this week last
year.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ended with November 5
number 216, against 217 last week and
148 in the corresponding week last year.
In Canada, failures for the week num
ber 19, as against 25 last week and 24 In
this week last year.
R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly trade review
to-morrow will say:
Unseasonably mild weather Is making
It possible for, farmers to secure much
late grain and cotton that seemed doomed
by early frosts, but on the other hand
the trade Is dull In heavy wearing ap
parel, fuel and many lines that should
now be made up, and .the nation will be
benefited by the Increased crops. The im
mediate effect is unfavorable. Manufac
turing activities have increased at cotton
mills, and several minor industries, but
in iron and steel there are more idle fur
naces and mills. Building permits are de
creasing and structural work Is not prose
cuted with the vigor that was seen last
year. The lumber trade is firm, despite
the moderate demand. '. .
Disappointment has been experienced
by those who bÂ«lleved that Quotations
for Iron and steel would go no lower.
Hides have declined In a few cases, but
the general Impression Is that the market
has reached bottom.
There were 246 failures this week In the
United States, against 235 last week and
279 last year. In Canada there were 22
this week, against 15 last week and 2S
last year.
Conditions of Weather

P. H. Bernays, manager of the Pope
Manufacturing Company, makes the
statement that manufacturers who have
not registered their trademarks in Japan
are threatened by a most serious state of
affairs, owing to the actions of certain
parties in Japan, who have recently reg
istered a number of the most famous
American trademarks. "This," says- Mr.
Bernays, .'"has resulted in a., practical
standstill in the business of articles cov
ered by such registrations, as the trade
has been warned that any one will be
prosecuted for selling goods under these
trademarks except when purchased
through the parties who are carrying out
this scheme.
"Owing to the severity of the Japanese
law respecting trademark infringements,
the dealers In Japan are In a very much
disturbed condition as to their status in
the matter. Those having stock are afraid
to sell and those without goods on hand
naturally refuse or fear to buy while such
a serious question is pending.
"This appears to be nothing less than
blackmail. It is very important for the
protection of. American manufacturers
that they should at once register their
trademarks in their own names. This
costs about $30 and the registration re
quires a resident agent, who only repre
sents the manufacturer before the Pat
ent Office,, and need not necessarily han
dle the goods. In fact, it is desirable that
the commercial Interests and the matter
of trademark representation be kept sep
arate.
"The Japanese are great imitators and
it is* very, important that manufacturers
should properly protect their trademarks
without further delay, for tliis is con
sidered by those best informed as but an
entering wedge in what may prove to be
a matter of great moment. The situation
is so oerious that there is no question of
the necessity for immediate and 'united
action on the part of all manufacturers
interested in the Japanese trade."
Unless Registered They
Are Usurped in
Japan.
AMERICAN TRADE
MARKS IN PERIL
Rabbi Jacob Nieto, pastor of the Sherith
Israel Synagogue, inaugurated his Friday
evening lectures last evening by deliver
ing a splendid sermon on "Religious In
struction." He discussed Its limits and Its
functions in an able manner, and made an
appeal to his auditors to defend the tra
ditions of their faith.
"At the present time," he said, "there
seems to be a great deal of .doubt as to
how far instruction may be imparted
from the pulpit, and the nature of that
instruction itself. There seems to be a
tendency to receive from the pulpit not
instruction, but what I would term
amusement. There seems to be a sort of
a desire among some of the community
to attend only such lectures as are an
nounced with sensational headlines.
"I call to mind a remark which was
once made to me by a thoughtless young
man, who did not reflect and who lacked
good judgment. He said, 'Tradition is
ruining us all.' Fancy what that means.
Tradition is ruining us all! tradition has
made us what we are. We cannot any
more escape our condition than we may
hope to escape our judges. Tradition has
come down to us and has helped to fash
ion and mold our inner selves, Â«nd we
are following traditional' thought and
ideas and are not conscious of doing it.
Tradition has made us what we are.
There is a. difference, however. We ac
cept traditions, but Interpret them differ
ently. Tradition antedates history.
"We are doing to-day what was done
2000 years agoâ we are simply interpreting
traditions and giving them that moral
value which we concei\'e to be necessary
in the time we live. The story of the
patriarch as a mere tale has no value.
The redemption of Israel as a mere story
has no value, but the practical moral ap
plication which is made of them makes
them, invaluable and priceless. Now, we
have had all these things handed down
to us by tradition first,' then collected and
endowed."
Dr. Nieto then took up the discussion
of the relation of the pulpit to the people.
He thought it was within the province
of the pastor to enlighten his congrega
tion' on all matters pertaining to their
welfare.
"AH matters science has under Its"con
trol." he said, "and which don't affect the
condition of , men morally, socially or
spiritually are outside the sphere of the
pulpit, but those things that science stud
ies and reveals to the world and gives to
it the benefit of Its investigations â psy
chology, for Instance, and all matters that
pertain to men and the disposition and
character of menâ those things that must
be studied and understood, learned and
apprehended, by those who wish to lead
and those who desire to be led, come
within the sphere of the pulpit."

AGED MASHER FROM LOS
ANGELES IS ARRESTED
A. C Dennison Follows a Young
Lady Till She Beaches Her
Uncle's House.
A. C. Dennison, a masher from Los An-
geles, about Â£Â£ years of age. appeared be-
fore Police Judge Conlan yesterday on a
charge of disturbing the peace. After
hearing the evidence the Judge convicted
him and ordered him to come up for sen-
tence this morning.
The evidence showed that Mis3 Mabel
de Long was walking past the Central
Theater on Thursday night on the way to
the house of her uncle. J. Wilson, on Clem-
entina .street, near Sixth. Dennison was
standing at the door of the theater, and
I the young lady noticed that he was fol-
lowing her. He kept close behind her
while she walked along Market street.
i down Sixth street to Clementina and
along Clementina. When she entered her
uncle's house she told him about the man
following her, ar.d he found Derfnison
standing on the steps- A policeman was
called and Dennison was arrested.
Dennison made the excuse- that he was
out for a stroll and walked behind Miss
de Long just to kill time. He said he had
no intention. of annoying her.

IN A STREET CAR in New York City the other day two women,
about equally well dressed, were seated side by side, one with a
dog on her lap. the other with a baby. It was hotand both women
were uncomfortable. She with the dog was meekly sacrificing her
"comfort to its comfort, and it was sitting there cool and dean and
cheerful. She with" the baby was. shifting it this way and that, looking
crossly now and then at its peevish face^ â who wouldn't be peevish if he
were tied up in a mass of warm clothes on a hot day, and had a cap
strapped over his head and fastened tinder the chin with strines that cut
into the flesh?
â¢ * It was apparent at a dance that the woman with the dog had studied
the habits, needs and nature of dogs and had diligently applied what she
had learned. It was apparent at a glance that the woman with the bibv
had never thought seriously on the subject of the peculiarities of babies.
These are the kinds of sights that bachelors love to talk over as they
sit in .groups in their clubs.
The above incident, which is being quoted far and wide, is an indi-
cation of a peculiar state of affairs that will soon be agitatinsr this citv.
It.mav seem to have no connection whatever with school teaching, but
nevertheless New York is iust now embroiled in a campaign against
â¢ married women as school teachers. The war of discrimination has spread
and spread, even tb England, and promises to be taken up here in no
less startling manner before long. And yet, "Why should not the school
teacher marry?" That is a question that even some of our own teachers
have answered with amazing variance of opinion in the^-next Sunday
Call. Meanwhile New York declares married women are entirely unfit
for teaching, and is rigidly enforcing a new rule against them. And
now can you conceive how that street-car incident quoted above has
anything to do with this remarkable war of polite extermination? Well,
it has, and every woman in the West, whether married or single, will
want to read it next Sunday.
Besides this there are many other things, that not only the women
but the men as well will want to read. For instance, the "Art of De-
signing as a Christmas Money Maker for Women." There is an article
to bring you good cheer while the wave of prosperity is receding.
Then there is the "Etiauette of the Swimming Girl." (You'll watch
for those photographs.) 1 The Me-ows of a Kitty, which gives every
woman an excellent chance to bring discomfiture to her recreant
lovers. "The Art of Posing." by Boye. (There's a gem of a full page
picture to go with this, a picture that every woman will talk about.)
"The Nursing of Cowslip." which is the strangest story vou ever read.
A page of photographs of the new winter shirt waists. The latest in-
stallment of "The Golden Fetich," which tells what actually was found
in the white ant's nest at the end of the l^iiibow in the land of the
Batoncas. and what became of the "Queen' of the Silver Sunrise." And
there is a new book page and^ â in point of fact there are pages on pages
of everything that is new, too numerous to mention in this limited
space. Anyway, you're going to see it all for yourself next Sunday,
especially the pictures.

Mrs. Beth, wife of Adolph H. Beth, one

The prune situation at the present time is a
striking illustration, where, with less than half
a crop in the world, a few speculators arbi
trarily fix a price far below its market value
and, before the crop is grown, send broadcast
over the world printed circulars quoting the
prices they had arbitrarily fixed. Thereupon
the prices dropped, and all the great markets
buying at a 3-cent basis dropped to the lower
quotation and prices tumbled the world over.
Sales being negotiated In London on a 3-cent
basis were called off, and In America the same
conditions followed, resulting in a demoralized
market, brought about and maintained by a
combination of speculators, packers, brokers,
local buyers working in tbe interest of the
speculators, transportation companies, man
agers of local associations, more closely affili
ated with the speculating element than with
the growers â all combined to hold down the
prices and oppress the growers. .
j It is an unequal struggje for the unorganized
growers, needing money, against this combina
tion of organized, monied, monopolists; yet a
few loyal growers are maintaining this unequal
struggle as never before in the history of this
State, and are going to win a 3-cent base. It
is a beginning of a better era to the growers.
And now may I ask that your lines of opera
tion be broadened, so as to embrace the prune
growers In their crusade foryfair prices: such
prices as will bo determined by the law of sup
ply and demand, and having secured this, then
demand an exact statement of the sales and
prices of the fruit later.
First having secured a price worth contend
ing for the prune growers can be relied upon
as reinforcements for the balance. Don"t fool
with the.spigsot until you have stopped the
waste at the bung.. .
â¢ The creating of artificial conditions to control
the markets, by inflating or depressing prices,
as best suits the interest of the speculating
buyer, is doing more injury * to the growers
than the false returns referred to In your
letter;
An open letter addressed to thÂ» editor
of The Call has been received from C. D.
Harvey, manager of the California Fruit
Exchange, in which the needs of the fruit
growers of California are discussed. The
text of the letter is as follows:
Your Dote of Inquiry as to tbe advisability of
sending on agent to the various markets where
California fruits are Bold to determine how far
tho portlucer obtains an exact statement of the
sales, and tbe prices of his fruit, has been
placed in my hands, with a request that I in
terest myself in the movement.
Having spent much of the last year in study
ing this problem, and investigating the subject
of distribution and sale of the growers" prod
ucts, I am interested in any movement tending
to relieve the growers from the speculating
conditions which have been forced upon them.
Both as grower and shipper I am familiar
with the methods employed in the distribution
and salo of elecldoua fruits, and took part in
organizing the Decidoua Growers' Shipping Ex
change, ' which brought the desired relief to
the erowers of decidoua fruits, and is to-day
the third largest fresh fruit shipping exchange
in tbe State. Turning from that field I have
the past year studied the dried fruit marketing
system of sale and distribution, as practiced
by the packers, brokers, Jobbers and managers
of the local associations, where the establish
ing of a fair market price is quite as import
ant, in my estimation, as "obtaining an exact
statement of the sales and prices of the fruit"
after the sale is made.

the entry of the American troops. , A mon

Superintendent McLaren filed his report
for October, which showed that work was
progressing rapidly on the new lake to be
used â¢ for sailing model yachts. The re
port also dealt with the. object of boring
for water in the park. Commissioner
Lloyd favored the plan to bore for water,
but objected to doing, so because of the
advice secured by means of a "divining
red," which the Commissioner designated
as "flim-flam." '
The Commissioners unanimously voted
that, an artesian ' well be bored, the esti
mated cost, of the work being $750. It is
expected. that a large body of water will
be found 600 feet down, and If this is done
considerable saving, will be made In the
cost of, water .for.' the ;park.
Commissioner 1 Lloyd suggested that re

George 13. Dow, president of the Dow
Engine Company, when Informed of the
charges filed by the Blerce-Stllwell Com
pany, said:
"I am surprised that Brown or any one
else should make such charges. The pump
at the Dutch windmill was in course of
construction by us for six months before
the Park Commission ever thought of
erecting the Dutch windmill. It was a
stock pump. "As to the statement Brown
claims was made by our George A. Dow,
there is not a word of truth. in Brown's
assertion. We treated him well while he
was with us, but Brown acted strangely
at times. This matter is spite work and
nothing else, and we will certainly ap
pear before the commission to refute the
claims put forward by Brown and his as
sociates."
The Park Commissioners discussed at
some length the model for fountains
which may be erected in the park and in
tlie downtown breathing places. The de
sign as accepted will be duplicated in the
erection of the drinking fountains in order
to save expense of having separate de
signs submitted.

"We let this contract to the Dow En
gine Company because Its pump was of
home manufacture; it was superior In
every way to any others, and it could
readily be repaired, as it was made in
sections. We took all these things into
account in awarding the contract, and
we were not bound to award the contract
to the lowest bidder, as you claim.
"Now, as regards these statements that
the Dow Company was building the pump
before the contract was awarded to them
and the insinuations that this commission
or some of its employes acted In collusion
with the company, we demand the fullest
investigation.- If there is fraud I want to
know it. I move that this matter go over
for the next meeting and that George A.
Dow and other members of the Dow Com
pany come here and refute these
charges."
Brown* Gafney and their lawyer then
offered to withdraw the petition, but the
Commissioners would not allow the step
to be taken, and the matter will come up
at the next meeting of the commission.

Herewith please, find. Bill No. 1211, entitled
"An ordinance requiring labels on packages
containing substances intended for human con
sumption," returned without my .approval for
the reason that, while this proposed ordinance
is apparently designed to prevent the use of
deleterious ingredients In the preparation of a
certain claps of manufactured articles, its terms
are so general and comprehensive as to be al
most prohibitory of all industries involving the
use of -packages, boxes or bottles containing
substances or fluids for human consumption.
It might be suggested that the objection men
tioned could be avoided by employment of more
particular and precise language and thereby
accomplish tbe specific purpose of this ordi
nance.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday vetoed the
ordinance requiring the placing of the
names of the ingredients on package's con
taining food for human consumption. The
Mayor took action as a result of the
protests of the local druggists, as it would
compel the manufacturers of patent medi
cines to put the formulae thereof on tile
bottles. In all likelihood the Board of
Supervisors will sustain the Mayor's veto,
as Dr. D f Ancona said at the last meeting
he would so recommend, as the Ordinance
was not designed to apply to medicines,
but only to 'foods preserved by artificial
means. In his communication' the Mayor
says :
Says Measure Would Be Prohibitory

Among those who will secure comfort
able billets in the city's employ cwlng to
Mayor Schmitz's re-election are John N.
Elbert, who stands a good chance to be
superintendent of the City and County
Hospital to succeed Resident Physician
McElroy. now in charge of the institution.
Elbert was superintendent for one year,
but was oblipred to pive way to McEIroy
as the Health Board desired to have a
physician at the head of the hospital. â¢
John Daughney, who was once defeated
for Tax Collector, may be appointed su
perintendent of the Almshouse to succeed
JV. J. Kelly. *
In aJ! likelihood Morris Levy will suc
ceed O. M. Tupper as light and water In
epector on or after January 8. The posi
tion pays $130 per month and is not under
civil, service.
The Mayor said yesterday that the char
ter prevented him from appointing pres
ent Election Commissioner Thomas F.
Bo.vle en the Board of Public Works to
eucceed Manson much as he would like
to appoint Boyle. The charter provides
that an election commissioner cannot hold
SLATED FOR POSITIONS.
Several subordinates whose salaries
were increased by Commissioners Casey
and Manson without authority from the
Board of Supereiisors are likely to suffer
a reduction to the original figures.
Mayor Schmitz will also put his re
trenchment policy into effect in the
Board of Health as soon as his commis
sioners are in the majority in the board
named. The employes who are liable to
be affected include one assistant secre
tary, $1500; one clerk in main ofhee. $1200;
one statistician, $1800; one assistant chem
ist. $12)0; one toxicolopist, $1200; one chief
sanitary Inspector. $1800; two assistant
sanitary inspectors, $2400; one assistant
plumbing inspector, $130S; five assistant
food inspectors, $5400; one market in
epector, $10S0; two assistant emergency
Burgeons, $2400; secretary to the commis
sary at the City and County Hospital,
$1500.
Mayor Schmitz stated yesterday that he
would not begin to consider the appoint
ments on the various commissions and
boards until December 13 next. â¢
The positions that will be directly af
fected by the new regime, together with
the yearly salaries attached to them, are
as follows:
One clerk in the general office, $1300:
one messenger, S900: one stenographer and
clerk of the bureau of buildings, $1500;
one clerk In the bureau of streets, $1300;
three clerks, bureau of streets, $4500; one
keeper in the corporation yard, $300; two
carpenters at the corporation yard, $2100;
three inspectors, bureau of architecture,
$3900; certain employes in the bureau of
engineering not specified, but considered
unnecessary by the Mayor, $10,000.
PLACES IN JEOPARDY.
The foregoing statement from Mayor
Behmitz outlines his intention to effect a
complete reorganization of the Board of
Public Works, and as a result many em
ployes In the department named are de
cidedly uneasy as they fear the Mayor's
wrath will fall upon them.
The first thing that will occur on Janu
ary S. 1?C<4. according to the Mayor, will
be the election of a new president of the
board to succeed Casey. The new presi
dent will be cither Herbert Schmitz or
the new commissioner to be named by the
Mayor. Then his Honor will Â«icpend on
the two commissioners to carry out his
policy as expressed in his message to the
Board of Supervisors last June. In that
event no less than twenty employes will
euffer the loss of their -positions owing
to consolidations the Mayor proooses to
effect.
"One of my first official acts after tbe
eijrhth day of next January will be to
begin the reorganization of the Board of
Public Works, with a view to lopping" off
unnecessary expenditures in that de
partment. This board has always come
In for much unfavorable criticism, and it
shall be my endeavor. If possible, to lm
rrove the conditions. The fact that next
year Z will have two friendly Commis
sioners on the board will enable me to
carry out the policy of retrenchment
which Z tried without success to have
the present Board of Supervisors put
Into effect when it adopted the budget
last June. Z think now, as I did then,
that there are many unnecessary posi
tions in the Department of Works and
that some salaries yre too hijrh and
should be reduced." â Mayor Schmitz in
an interview.
Considerable indication wa3 expressed
by the members of the Park Commission
yesterday when an attempt was made
to charge the members of the commis
sion with fraud in the letting of a con
tract for the pump for the Dutch wind
mill on the ocean beach.
At the meeting of the commission a
protest Â¦ was presented by an attorney
named Brownstone, on behalf of the
Bierce -Stllwell Company of Ohio, the pe
tition reciting that the commission had
not accepted the bid of the company for
a pump, its bid being the lowest, and fur
ther charged that the Dow Engine Com
pany, which received the bid, had built
the pump before the contract was let,
the inference being that there- had been
collusion between the commission and the
Dow corporation.
The commission was startled by the
charges in the petition and was greatly
surprised when two nien, named Brown
and Gafney, were brought before the
commission, to try and substantiate the
charges.
President A. B. Spreckels and Commis
sioners Reuben H. Lloyd, Jasper Mc-
Donald, A. Altmann and Frank J. Sul
livan were determined to Investigate the
causes that led to the charges of the
petition, and examination of the witnesses
showed that Brown was the prime mover
in the affair.
It transpired that he had formerly been
employed by the Dow Engine Company,
but was now an employe of the Bierce
Stilwell Company.
FLIMSY STORY OF BRO^N".
Brown's demeanor before the commis
sion was impertinent and he was repri
manded a number of times by members
of the commission.
Brown's story was that in October last,
while he was working for the Dow Engine
Company, he Jemarked to George A. Dow,
a member of the firm, . that the Park
Commission was to ask for bids for- a
pump for the Dutch windmill.
"Dow said to me." continued Brown.
" 'Why, we. are building the pump now
and you are working on It.' "
Brown claimed that this conversation
took place on October 1, while the com
mission let the contract for the pump on
October 9. He further claimed that when
he went to work for the Bierce Stllwell
Company he told the manager of
that firm that it was no use to bid for
the Â¦ contract for the pump because the
Dow Company was already building It.
Brown," was repeatedly asked by the
Commissioners if George A. Dow or any
member of the Dow Engine Company had
informed him that the firm was building
the pump on account of any. understand
ing with any member of the commission,
or any park employe.
Brown would not answer the question,
"yes or no," as demanded,. but went into
long rambling explanations. He was final
ly forced to admit that no such Intima
tion had been conveyed to him.
The attorney who appeared with Brown
and Gafney then tried to explain that
Gafney was a stenographer and had
drawn up the protest and that no in
sinuation of fraud was meant. Â¦ -
COMMISSIONER LLOYD iuJGRY.
Commissioner Lloyd â¢ waxed wroth at
this statement and said:
"This petition distinctly charges fraud
against this commission, and you even

Several cellars in Chinatown were con
demned as unsanitary and ordered to be
torn out.
The Health Board yesterday rescinded
the resolution adopted June 15, 1900,
recommending the Almshouee tract as a
site for the new City and County Hos
pital. On Dr. Buckley's motion the pres
ent site of the hospital was recommended
to the Board of Supervisors as the proper
location for the new building, for which
bonds have been voted. The members of
the board present . were unanimously In
favor of the existing site, as they believe
that the Almshouse tract is not properly
situated for & hospital, owing to the bad
climatic conditions. Dr. Buckley held
that the old site is more accessible, nearer
to the city and In a warmer zone.
The suspension of William Ross, com
missary at the Almshouse, by Superin
tendent Kelly for alleged abusive lan
guage was referred to the Almshouse
committee.
The detectives learned that the negro
had pawned the gun at a Paciflc-sjreet
establishment, and while working in this
neighborhood connected him with tbe Pa
cific-street robbery. They then ascer
tained that the mistress of the thief re
sided at 225 Townsend street and they
watched the house. On Thursday night
the detectives were occupied in another
portion of the city and Policemen Cronln
and Tobln relieved them. The policemen
had been at the place but a short time
when the negro appeared and was taken
Into custody. "When put through the
sweating process he admitted both crimes
and was locked up to await trial.
Harry de Redd, colored, an ex-soldier,
confessed to a charge of burglary and one
of grand larceny at police headquarters
last night. He was immediately locked
up in the City Prison and charged. Three
days ago he forced an entrance to the
residence of Mrs. Sadie Sullivan at 102
Silver street, and on October 22 he robbed
a laborer named John Slater in a Pacific
street dive of $300. The confession was
made to Detectives Ryan and Taylor.
Mrs. Sullivan employed De Redd to
move her furniture to the Silver-street
residence a few days before the burglary.
She occupied the upper flat and he was
not seen in the neighborhood until the
day of the crime. He then called upon
the people that reside below and asked
their permission to upe a ladder in the
yard . for the purpose of entering the
place. He said that Mrs. Sullivan had
lost her keys and that she desired him to
open the door from the inside. He set
the ladder against a window, pried the
sath with a jimmy and entered. While
Inside he took $6 50 in coin and a revolver,
then escaped, but the police were soon on
his trail.
