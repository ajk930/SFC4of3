HARTFORD. Conn., July 22.â By means
of his wireless telephone A. Frederick
Collins to-day successfully transmitted
speech between this city and East Hart
.forcS, with' the Connecticut River. Inter

ventor had been made from one Hudson
River ferry-boat .to another, and they
were fairly successful. The Instruments
which were employed to-day were used In
transmitting messages In the experiments
made at Rockland Lake, where articulate
speech was communicated a distance of a
mile., The wireless telephone partakes of
the nature of both the wireless' telegraph
and the- ordinary Â¦* telephone, although
there are several differences in ;â¢ detail.

LONDON. July 23.â The delicate, not to
cay critical, situation In the Far East,
arising from the rivalry between Russia
and Japan and involving the Question of
peace or war between those powers, is
causing rjo little anxiety to the British
Government. The Foreign Office received
two or three days ago from the British
legation in Peking dispatches represent
ing the situation as one of considerable
danger. The question was the subject of
<5ellbe.rat.fon by the Cabinet yesterday and
late last night very urgent news dis
patches were tent to the British Charge
<3'ACair<es in Peking.
Investigations in well informed Quarters
In London confirm the statements that
'Japan Is firmly determined to oppose to
jthe utmost of her ability what she re
gards as Russia's aggression in Korea,
for It Is thrre rather than in Manchuria
that Japan's sensibilities are touched.
'Buesia's operations in the timber forests
Â¦ct the Yalu Valley, though they are os
tensibly commercial, are viewed in a very
different light in Tokio, where they are
rcgardÂ«;d as definite military occupation.
Rath/er than acquiesce in such a situa
tion. Jji'pan is prepared to go to war. She
Is not disposed to carry on diplomatic
correspondence for an unlimited time,
end. feeling herself ready to put the mat
ter to a final test of arms, she does not
ehrinlc from meeting the ordeal. The
contempt of Kuropatkin. the Russian
Minister of War, and other high Russian
officials, for Japan's military organization
endangers the Fituation, especially as
Â«ach country considers that further de-
Jay in settling the question tends to bene
fit Its rival.
Certain incidents that can be observed
here 5Â»dica.te that the British Government
realizes that the situation holds a serious
posEfbtlity. In this connection it is re
marked that the admiralty recently has
beÂ«n unusually silent regarding the move
ments of the British squadron on the
China, station, while it is known that
enormous stocks of coal have been going
to the Far East depots for weeks past,
concurrently with the issuing of orders
lo k*ep the stocks renewed to the fullest
capacity.
In view of these developments it may
be relevant to remark that the reasons
alkjjed for the abandonment of Earl Rob
erts' visit to the United States appear to
be curiously insufficient. A section of the
British press lately called attention to the
fact that Sir Ernest Satow. the British
Minister to China, who was returning to
Peking from his leave of absence, which
he spent in England, stopped in India and
raade a Journey to Simla to confer with
the 'Viceroy and the Indian Government,
arwl it was inferred that he went to dis
cuss possible contingencies in the Fir
E*Â«. Whether the incident bears Â«uch
an interpretation can be ior the present
only conjecture, nor can any confirmation
be obtained of a rumor current here to
the effect that in the event of certain cir
cumstances arising in the Far East the
United Stales squadron now at Lifbon
-will go to Chinese waters b: way of the
SuÂ£* Canal. .' (

t PEKING, July 23.â Prince Ching. the
president cf the Foreign Office, has writ
ten to United States Minister Conger, re
fusing to open towns in Manchuria, la
Q".la letter lie dwells upon the impossibility
te>? China -opening to foreigners towns
."which are net in her possession, but
which are held by Russian troops, and
points out the complications which Â¦would
i>e likely to fellow.
Â¦ It If bÂ«'!:eved here, however, that a
â¢compromise may be reached by including
one townâ Tatur.gkaoâ in the new com
mercial ticaty.
WASHINGTON*. July as
the Chinese Government very recently has
expressed its willingness to yield to the
desires of the United States for open
ports la y^nchuria the cSlcials here are
fit a loss to understand the communica
tion sent by Prince Ching to Minister
Cor.ger, refusing this concession. They
have received no advices en the subject.
bSQXKSSed by the heretofore expressed
willingness of China to cpÂ«n Manchurian
ports, reinforced by the assurances given
to this Government by Russia alcr.g the
came lints, the officials continue firm in
their belief that the situation ultimately
will be clarified and the effoits cf the
United Sta:es be rewarded. In some quar
ters the objections urged to the opening
cf ports in Prince Chings communication
tre regarded as a mere diplomatic quib
ble cesiET-.od. perhaps, to placate Russia.
China, which is here retarded as the
Movfreign power in placet uria, made a
pledge to open Manchuria and tfce United
States Government fully intends that it
shall be tee^t to the letter.
"Altogether the improvements which
the company proposes will cost In the
neighborhood of $1,000,000. all of which
amount will be expended in and around
Alameda. If the attitude of the City
Trustees in delaying our franchise Is re
ceiving, the support of the public of Ala
meda we want to know it. If the people
of that place do not want us. we shall be
obliged to withdraw. We do not want to
da this, but the attitude of the Trustee*
13 forcing us to shape our plans to that
end.
"A franchise for any less term than
fifty ' years will not be accepted by the
Southern Pacific Company, as the outlay
for Its proposed improvements Is too large
to justify going ahead without a guaran
tee- of a long term In which we shall have
the privilege of operating. "We are, loth
to abandon the present terminus, but
there seems to be no other alternative.
"In case it shall appear that we can
not secure the franchise we have asked
for we shall withdraw from Alameda al
together. This will not work any partic
ular hardship On the company, but It will
be a severe blow to Alameda. Our with
drawal will mean a heavy depreciation
of property values throughout the sec
tion we traverse and will cause the re
moval from that place of many thou
sands of people who now make their
homes there on account of the methods
of transportation we furnish.
"All that Is necessary for us to do 13
to construct a branch from West San
Leandro to the main line and make our
terminus at Oakland pier. This plan has
many advantages from a railroad stand
point. The cost of constructing and op
erating the line will be very much less
than the price of completing the improve
ments at the Alameda mole and at the
same time It would tend to center the
business of the company at Oakland, by
which operating expenses would be great
ly reduced.
"As I said, we have no desire to with
draw from Alameda. but If the people do
not want ua, there, we are prepared to
find, another outlet for our business. It
rests entirely with them and we hope that
for their own Interests they will recog
nize the necessity of retaining the road
and force the Trustees to grant us the
only franchise under which we would feel
justified In continuing our work there."
telephone will work at present Is limited,
but the Inventor is confident that in time
this difficulty will be overcome. The ap
paratus operates m the open air. but not
to any appreciable distance. The most
successful experiments have been mads
on the water.
This new system is said to be especially
useful for ferry-boajs and other harbor
craft, as by means of It messages may
be readily sent from one to another.
As energy from the wireless telephone is
radiated In every direction, this feature Is
not objectionable, as In a harbor the
various vessels should be aware of the
presence of one another. It is the con
tention of "the Inventor that there has
been no real improvement in the mean*
of signaling craft since the Introduction
of the steam wfcistla.
"It Is true we contemplate stopping all
work on the proposed new depot at thÂ«
Alameda mole. The Southern Pacific
Company- does not feel Justified in going
ahead with Us plans on the narrow-gauga
road and incurring the great expense en
tailed in their completion unless it is as
sured of a fifty-year franchise. So far
the City Trustees of Alameda have not
acted on our petition for a franchise and
until they do nothing further will be
done toward the completion of the depot
and the standardizing of the track to
Santa Clara.
It is officially announced that thÂ« work
of reconstructing the pier and depot at
the Alameda mole will be discontinued by
the Southern Pacific Company until such
time aa definite action has been taken by
the City Trustees upon the two applica
tions for fifty-year franchises for its lo
cal roads filed by the corporation.
Some of the workmen employed at the
pier and depot site were laid off indefinite
ly yesterday morning without being given
any reason for their discharge. There Is
much to be done before- a pier and depot
to replace those destroyed by fire nearly
a year ago are ready for use. Thus far
only the preliminary work of clearing
away the debris, pulling up damaged piles
and framing some of the lumber to ba
utilized in the structure has been done.
Since the citizens of Alameda have by
a petition placed themselves on record as
being in favor of granting the Southern
Pacific franchises for five years, instead
of the fifty-year privileges the company
seeks, the management is somewhat
perturbed over the situation and ha3 de
cided to move slowly in negotiations and
proposed improvements in that city.

tendent of the road, when seen last night
at his home in thi3 city, said In relation

man of the Government printing office,
whose dismissal from that office the Pres
ident recently revoked, is permitted to re

day sent a communication to Secretary
Corulyou of the Department of Com
merce and Labor strongly expressing
their position against Miller's reinstate
ment. The union also gave out a state
ment reciting the developments in the
Â«-ase and charging Miller with using scur
rilous language about those employed un
der him. and slandering the bookbinders'
organization, in which he was a member.
The statement recites:
Our oreanization does not or cannot dictate
the policy of conducting the affairs of the
bindery in the Government printing olflce. The
rules are the same as control all the union
ehope in the United States.
That Mr. Miller had cheapened any class
of work for the Government and tliat that
was the cause at his suspension and expulsion
I* not true. Miller's methods were the most
unbusinesslike of any foreman ir. the office
and his tactics In punishing men under him
were contemptible. In the office and public
]ilace fi he made use of scurrilous and in
*ultlnÂ« rezn&rke about employes, causing a
distrust in his division as to permanence of
eaiplojment.
The statement closes as follows:
The unions havt never requested Mr. Mil
ler's discharge from the Government printing
office. It chould be noted, however, that our
constitution forbids us to work witii a eus>
r*nded or expelled member. \\> learned that
Mr. Miller had been discharged on legal
charges preferred by the public printer in
accordance with the civil service law. Our
evidence clearly demonstrates that he had con
tinually abused the public printer in public

REINSTATEMENT
WASHINGTON, ' July 22.â Charles
Hedges to-day was removed from the of
fice of superintendent of free delivery of
the Postofflce Department on the charge
of falsifying his diary and loaning his
traveling commission. It is charged "that
he reported himself at various .places,
when, in fact, he was not at those places
on the date's mentioned, in some instances
being hundreds of miles away. Hedges,
while making no general denial of the
charges, contended that they were not suf
ficient justification for removal.
Ervin Thorpe, postofflce inspector In
charge at New York, who has been assist
ing in the administration of the free deliv
ery service since the Inception of the in
vestigation, has been designated acting
superintendent in place of Hedges. The
official statement in the case made public
to-day by Fourth -Assistant Postmaster
General Bristow says in part:
On October 25, 1900, Hedges states under oath
in his diary that he was at Joplin, Mo., on
"extension of free delivery service." when In
fact he was In Mansfield, Ohio, attending the
funeral of former Secretary John Sherman. On
December 7, 1899, he reports himself at San
Antonio. Tex., "investigating carrier service,"
while in 'act he was in Mexico on a mining
property. In the month of October, 1889. A.
W. McBean. superintendent of free delivery,
was sick with typhoid .fever and Hedges was
at the department, acting as superintendent.
In his diary he states under oath that he was
at various places, namely New York. Philadel
phia. Bridgeport. Conn.; Camden. X. J.. and
elsewhere, "actually engaged In traveling on
the business of the free delivery service." As-
Fistant superintendents of free delivery are al
lowed a per diem of $4 in lieu of expenses for
each day actually traveling on business for
the department. Hedges' false statements as
to his whereabouts were manifestly for the pur
pose of collecting per diem to which he was
>iot entitled.
There are many other Instances of similar
falsifications. The facts were submitted to th*
Postmaster General some days since, who di
rected Hecrcs* removal for the reasons above
set forth.
BEISTOW INFORMS HEDGES.
The case was worked up by Postoffice
Inspector George Sutton, assisted by In
spectors Bennett and Johns. There were
several charges on file against Hedges,
but none of these constituted the basis of
hi* dismissal. The acts which led to his
removal were discovered by the inspectors
in the course of their general investiga
tion of the records of the free delivery of
fice. 'The case has been under investiga
tion for several weeks. Bristow sum
moned Hedges shortly before the close
of office hours this afternoon and notified
him of his dismissal.
Hedges was appointed to the postal ser
vice from the Tenth Congressional Dis
trict of Texas on July 1, 1898, and was ap
pointed superintendent of free delivery
July 1. 190L His salary was $3000 a year.
He had charge of the delivery service In
the cities, the rural free delivery service
being under another superintendent, and
both being under the general supervision
of August W. Machen.
In a statement to-night Hedges said: .
While I was aetUtant superintendent of free
delivery, with headquarters at New York. 1
was called to Washington to take charge of
the entire service while Mr. Machen was 111
with typhoid fever. While so acting I got $2000
?Â¦alary as assistant euperintendent, while Mr.
Machen received $3500. It was necessary tor
me to get the per diem allowance to make the
services and the compensation equal. It has
been the practice of the office for the party tak
ing the place of the head of the ten-ice to'
claim oer diem in some form. In my case I
was also supervising the Eastern division while
officiating a!? general superintendent here.
NAMES THE INFORMANT.
Herbert W. Valentine, now in the New York
postofflce. and formerly stenographer there un
der me. surrendered private letters and notes
to the inspectors which gave them this Informa
tion. I used to drop htm a line when I was
traveling to keep him posted on my where
abouts. Valentine Is the one who used this
postofflce commission. It was used with the
knowledge of General Superintendent Machen
and of First Assistant Postmaster * General
Johnson. Valentine was anxious to go out on
field work. Bristow refused to allow the issu
ance of a commission for Valentine on the
ground that he was a clerk and not an officer.
Machen. however, held that as Valentine was
engaged on the work of the office his use of the
commission was not Illegal. As to the San
Antonio reference. I waa in Mexico, but not ex
rminlng mining property. I did not see this
mining property. In making my reports I never
put down towns that I had not visited, nor
did I put down all the towns that I visited, as
I was permitted to do. Thus I omitted men
tioning the Mansfield visit, because I had no
official work there and JopIIn was the last
place where I had had official work. I elmply
prolonged the time on the list.
Bristow declined to-night to' say any
thing as to the status of Valentine, who
Hedges said traveled on his commission.
/It has been stated that Cannon is op
posed to. any agitation of the financial
question and that he would exercise his
power as Speaker of the House after elec
tion to prevent any legislation looking to
changes In the present currency system.
These statements, it is said, do not re
flect his views. He does not approve of
some of the financial- measures, but he
indicates that if there* be a substantial
sentiment next fall in favor of currency
legislation he will not be found standing
In the way of it.
Senator Platt said after his call on the
President t_at he would come to Oyster
Bay to conclude a conference concerning
jiome present matters in New York Stite.
These matters, he added, were not in
shape at present for public discussion.
Jo... part, they related to appointments to
be made HSy the President.
Platt declared that every Republican In
New York was supporting the President
freely and enthusiastically and he had
no more doubt of his election than he
had of his nomination. As to the or
ganization of the Republican National
Committee the Senator said that Senator
Hanna, in his judgment, would be re
elected chairman, and he had no doubt
Mr. Hanna would consent to serve again.
OYSTER BAY, July 22.â While ad
mitting before he left for New York that
proposed financial legislation was under
consideration to-day. Representative Can
non Insisted that his call upon the Presi
dent was principally social. Matters of
legislation, .both financial and general.
wer% discussed briefly and informally, but
no definite conclusions were reached.
Cannon said it was not certain whether
or not the House. would take up for con
sideration financial legislation at the ex
traordinary session in November. That
could be determined finally only by the
House 'iiself. '

IMPRESSIVE to a marked degree was
the solemn requiem mass offered up
yesterday morning at St. Mary's
; Cathedral for the repose of the. soul
of the late Pontiff, Leo XIII. In acordU
ance with the request of Archbishop Rlor
dan, the exterior and interior of the sa
cred edifice had been draped with suitable
emblems of mourning. The main doors
of the cathedral were shrouded in black
cloth, hiding . the elaborate carvings of
marble. Around the galleries were draped
widths of black velvet edged with a nar
row strip of white lace, j The front of the
organ loft was similarly hidden, but the
main emblems of grief were displayed on
the altar and sanctuary. The Â¦; lofty,
stained-glass window back .of the altar,
representing the assumption ofthe Blessed
Virgin, was eo~rapletely hidden by grace
ful folds of black crepe. The ornaments
of the altar had been removed, and only
the ' massive candelabra lent a tinge of
color to the white marble. The candelabra
were draped in black cloth, and the same
material covered the front of the altar,
upon which appeared a 'Latin cross in
white. vel vet. ,The tall pillars on each side
of the sanctuary were completely covered
with black cloth, and the pulpit waa sim
ilarly treated.
The solemn mass commenced at 9
o'clock, and for an hour previous the big
bell of the <athedral was tolled. The im
pressive service for the dead was intoned
by the Vicar General, father J. J. Pren
dergast, assisted by Father J. B. Hannl
gan, deacon; Father Charles A. .Ramm,
sub-deacon, and Rev. George Inglefield,
master of ceremonies. . , *
â¢ To the soft tones of the organ the-of
ficiating priests advanced to the front of
the altar, upon which burned six tall can
dles. The candles on the side altars were
not burning, as a sign of mourning for
the Pope. .
Archbishop Rlordan, wearing his robes
and supported by Father Mulligan, occu
pied the throne, while Coadjutor Arch
bishop Montgomery also took a place at
the altar.
The Intoning of the requiem mass by
Vicar" General Prendergast was most im
pressive and the solemn ceremony was
listened to with rapt attention by the
worshipers present.
The musical portion of the service con
sisted of the "Requiem" by Schmidt and
Cherublnl.
A death-like stillness pervaded the in
terior of the cathedral at that portion of
the service consisting of the elevation of
the host. The officiating priests and the
acolytes knelt before tho altar, while the
commanding figure of General
Prendergast towered above all. The con
gregation knelt and the solemnity of the
occasion was felt by all who took part
p In it.
At the close of the service Archbishop
Riordan addressed the congregation and
announced that the consecration of
Bishop-elect Liebert of Honolulu would
take place on Saturday morning at 8
o'clock. The Archbishop said that, though
the Catholic church was in mourning for
the late Pontiff, the work of consecrating
the new Bishop was a necessity.
His Grace also Invited all present to
take part in the pontifical requiem, mass
for the departed Pontiff which will be in
toned on Sunday morning next at 11
o'clock. He said that the hour would cor
respond with the time that the body of
the dead Pontiff would be interred In
Rome.
In concluding his brief address the
Archbishop, asked the prayers of all for
the soul of Pope Leo XXII and also that
divine inspiration might rest upon the
conclave of Cardinals, upon whom de T
volved the duty of electing a supreme
head of 'the Catholic church. The Arch
bishop said in conclusion that all Catholics
would pray that God would guide the Car
dinals to select another Pontiff to take
the place .of the one who is mourned all
over the world.
ST. PAUL, Minn., July 22.â To-day's ses
Â¦ Ion of the dairy and food convention was
enlivened by a spirited controversy grow
ing out of the discussion of the food ques
tion from the manufacturers' standpoint.
T. M. Frailey of Camden. N. J., intimated
that dairy and food authorities should not
take .as active a part in legislative mat
ters' as they do. It was enough if they
enforced the laws, he said, without going
out of their way to frame laws on their
own responsibility.
Hon. C. "W. Scoville of Kentucky took
exception to this part of Frailey's state
ment. â¢ He thought Frailey could not have
meant just what he said and thought an
explanation was due. B. H. Warren, the
commissioner of Pennsylvania, also said
that the remarks were unwarranted and
should be withdrawn. But Frailey neither
withdrew his remarks nor made an ex
planation. R- J. Mauck of Columbus
arose and held aloft a circular which he
shook fiercely, declaring that it was an
outrage and a cowardly attack upon the
dairy commissioner of every State.
"It is a base insinuation," said he.
"against Dairy Commissioner McConnell
and evefy honest official."
The circular was a letter addressed to
dealers and signed by Frailey. In which
the dealers were told not to fe^ar the
dairy and food officials who pretended to
know a great deal about law, as they
were generally overstepping their author
ity and half the time had no authority of
law for their action. It urged in an in
sinuating manner a defiance by dealers of
the food N commissioners* regulations.
The matter was dropped without action
being taken.

REPORT OF THE AUTOPSY.
ROME, July 22.â Dr. Lapponl this morn
ing presented to Cardinal Oreglia the of
ficial report of the autopsy performed ye.s
terday on the body of the Pope, which
was conducted so far as permissible in
connection with the embalming. The re
port Is chiefly important in disproving the
presence of cancer or nephritis. The text
of the report follows:
We began by injecting: Into the thigh more
than five liters of special preserving liquid.
Having opened the abflomen, the lower, viscera
were extracted and round to be perfectly
healthy.- The spleen and kidneys were also ab
solutely normal. In thÂ« latter the cortical cub
stance was well, preserved and of a pale pink
color. After, opening the thorax It was found
that the heart, the aorta and the carotid ar
teries were healthy, except that In the arch
aorta was found an atherometus excrescence.
Nothing was found In the pericardium. The
pleura on the left side was quite normal, but
on the right side the pleura was full of liquor
of an orange-yellow color 'above and bloody at
the bottom, with a Urge clot of flbrlnÂ« float-
Ing? More flbrine was on the free surface of
the rleura toward the ribs, with a slight
scraping of flbrine easily detached, allowing a
view of the surface t erum.
'The upper superior part of the right lung
was quits normal, but the upper lower part
was somewhat hard and cracked at the touch,
and while cutting a whitish frothy liquid oozed
out. . The Inferior lobÂ« had partly adhered to
the wall of the thorax and when this was cut
a dirty-white 'abundant liquid oozed out. show

This report was accompanied with an
anatomic diagnosis made by all the doc
tors participating in the embalming,
which say a there was found a round gray
hepatlzatlon of -the right inferior pulmo

incision made for the examination was sewed
up and the body put In order.
WASHINGTON, July 22.-The State De
partment haa issued a warrant for the
surrender to the - Danish authorities of
J. A. Joergensen, charged with embez
zlement from a firm that employed him
as bookkeeper. Joergensen eloped from

ROME, July 22,-The first of the
great ceremonies of Pope Leo's
funeral commenced to-day, when
â¢ the body lay In state In the throne
room of the Vatican from 9:30 a. m." until
1 p. m/"- All the diplomats accredited to
the Vatican, the Roman Princes, Dukes,
Barons and other representatives^ of an
cient families remaining faithful to the
papacy; all the high dignitaries of the
church, the Archbishops, Bishops and
heads of the religious orders, passed in
solemn procession before the bier.
The papal throne had been removed,
and in its place under the famous red
silken canopy on a small bed lay the body
of Leo. Over the bed was thrown a red
damask covering, on which the body re
posed, robed In white vestments, with the
red rochet and camaure hood and on the
feet slippers embroidered with. gold. ThÂ«
thin hands, clasped over the chest, held
tightly a small ivory crucifix. Around this
was entwined a rosary of mother of pearl
set in gold. On the third finger of the
right hand the huge emerald pontifical
ring sparkled.
In striking contrast with the pale face
was the purple hood, drawn down over
the .head almost to the eyebrows and
over the ears. The sunken . cheeks and
jaws brought the nose and chin nearly to
gether on the mouth, which was reduced
almost to nothing, though no signs of
agony were visible. It was the body of a
man who might have been dead fifty
years.
NOBLE GUABD HOLDS VIGIL.
On either side near the shoulders stood
a member of the Noble Guard, erect and
motionless, only a faint quiver of the
drawn swords giving any indication that
they were not mere statues. The ordeal
of the soldiers In the heated chamber is
so intense that they have to be constant
ly relieved.
At the four corners of the bed stood
lighted candles ten feet high. On the right
of the body, close to the bed. was a' small
table covered with a white linen cloth, on
which were two candles throwing a glim
mer of light on the crucifix between them.
At the foot of the cross was a crystal
bowl filled with holy water from which
each Cardinal ' whenever he passed the
body sprinkled it and uttered a benedlc-.
tlon. Beside this were the devotional
books used by the Pope.
The silence was unbroken save by the
solemn chanting of six of the Franciscan
penitentiaries, who, kneeling or standing
at a ben'ch at the fQot of the bier, con
tinued their Incessant supplications.
To the left and right on the walls two
great, gold and marble brackets supported
many tranches of candelabra, but these
were not lighted, nor were the lamps on
the marble columns at each corner of the
throne room. The only light thrown on
this solemn scene came from the candles
beside -the body and from the faint rays
of sunlight which filtered through the two
windows.
The red damask tapestries with which
the room was hung gave a touch of royal
splendor to the surroundings. -Otherwise
it was an almost simple scene for the
death rites of a Pope. There was no car
pet on the marble floor, and not a flower
was to be seen, according to the strict
ritual of the last honors of the church to
a Pontiff. .
LAST LOOK AT THE DEAD.
As each lay or clerical dignitary entered
the throne room he advanced slowly to
the side of the bed, took one last look at
the body and then withdrew. Some knelt
in momentary prayer and. crossed them
selves. It was the last tribute of devo
tion and affection, rather than mere out
ward homage, to the head of the great
church.
Outside the throne room the long corri
dors of the Vatican presented a brilliant
spectacle. At the entrance of the* court
of St. Damaso pontifical gandarmes ' were
drawn up and rendered military honors
as each carriage drove in. The diplomats
were In full uniform and the Princes and
others were dressed In black.
From the St. Damaso court they passed
up the marble staircase into the Clemen
tlno Hail, where the Swiss Guard was
ranged in double columns on either side.
Next they entered the hall of. Palafre
mlrl, where twenty-five grooms In red
livery led the way to the hall x 6f the
Swiss, where a company of gendarmes
stood on guard at the threshold of the
antechamber, containing a platoon of
the Palatine Guard. Farther along they
passed through the hall of Tapestry and
the chapel of the Pope. The Noble Guard,
in full scarlet uniforms, glittering brass
helmets and, silver sashes, the latter cov
ered with crepe, kept the last watch at
the door of the apartment of their dead
master.
Outside the Vatican an interested
crowd, including a number of Italian sol-
Miers, watched tho coming and going of
the privileged mourners.
In the meanwhile the congregation of
Cardinals met in the hall of the Consis
tory, under the presidency of Cardinal
Oreglia. It was determined to arrange
for the accommodation of the Cardinals
during their enforced seclusion at the
conclave in exactly the same manner as
when Pope Leo was elected.
Monslgnor Merry del Val took up the
duties of secretary of the con/lstorlal con
gregation.
TRIBUTE FBOM EBIN'S SONS.
Cardinal Oreglia received the following
following telegram:
HOUSE OF COMMONS. WESTMINSTER,
July 21.â At to-day's meeting of the Irish
Parliamentary party, on motion of John Red
mond, president, supported by John Dillon, as
representatives of a people who by so many
centuries of suffering . bas attested its fidelity
to the Holy See, we hasten to associate our
selves with the people of Ireland In their sor
row for the event which has agitated the Cath
olic church, throwing the entire civilized peo
ple in mourning. If anything can alleviate
the pain which every Catholic roof supports
in thÂ« loss of our glorious Pontiff, it is the
consoling remembrance of the noble, saintly
life of the Holy Father, his serenity In the
midst of universal anxiety, his devotion td
duty and his marvelous life, which has ren
dered the influence of religion stronger through
out the world, thus alleviating human life.
-We pray Sir Thomas Esmond* and Captain
Donelan to be the interpreters of the profound
condolence of the party on the occasion of the
funeral of his Holiness. JOHN REDMOND.
Cardinal Oreglia received the following
,from King Edward: I
I LONDON. July 21.â Hlg Majesty received
the news of the death of the PopÂ« with pro
found grief and orders me to transmit to your
Kminence assurances of his sincere sympathy.
His Majesty will always preserve a grateful

where the chapter and clergy of Sti
Peter's awaited the procession, the. lat
ter formally received and took possession
of the body. The torch, mace and cross
bearers started forward, giving an op
portunity to the chapter to take up appo
sition" immediately preceding the bier.
INTO THE . OBEAT BASILICA.
The final stage of. bearing "the prisoner
of the Vatican" to his resting place then
commenced. From the SIstlne Chapel the
procession- wound. oiit around. the Loggia,
immortalized by Raphael; encircled . the
court of San Damaso and descended the
private* Staircase, still chanting, into the
basilica. .
The moment the flaring torches, which
still led the cortege* entered St. Peter's,
the choir, which wasi waiting there, com
menced to sing ;in cadence
"Libera de Domlne.". Monslgnor Car
cani. the canon of St. Peter's, solemnly
sprinkled holy , water^ upon Leo's body
and pronounced absolution. As the body
was borne across the threshold the
cathedral choir, .still singing, took the lead
of the now lengthy procession. The in
tense silence that prevailed was broken
only by the chanting that 'echoed and re
echoed from the huge dome and deserted
aisles of the chapel as .the body was
borne down the nave to the Chapel of the
Sacrament. There candles burned bright
ly-;' At this chapelle ardente the body was
reverently stretched behind the iron gates
and two members of the Noble Guards
took up-posltions on either side of. the
bier.
The procession then \ reformed and re
turned to the Vatican,' leaving the body
of Leo XIII in the greatest church In the
world alone, except for the faithful
guard and, penltentlalrles, â¢' whose ; pray
ers could be heard in .the Immediate
vicinity of the Chapel of the Sacrament.
Throughout the remainder of the vast
basilica silence reigned. '-
The body of the dead Pope to-night
rests on j the ; high catalfalque. with the
slippered feet protruding through the
gates to be kissed by the falthfulwhen
they will be admitted In the church to
morrow and the following two days.
â¢ANCIENT KEY IS LOST.
While the remains of the Pope were be
ing carried into St. Peter's this evening
the private ceremony of depositing the
urn containing the viscera in the. Church
of SS., Vincent and Anastaslus was tak
ing, place
A curious hitch occurred when the sol
emn procession arrived at the door of the
special depository in the crypt. It was
stopped, as the key was not to be found.
The attendants hunted high and low and
finally were obliged to break down the
door. The depository had not been opened
since 1846, as, contrary to custom., the
viscera of Pius IX are at St. Peter's. The
rector of the Church of SS. Vincent and
Anastasius will ask that the viscera of
Pius IX be' transferred to his church in
order to make the sequence complete. "'
The will of the late Pope is still un
opened, as proved by the fact that his
apartment is sealed. Otherwise the ob
jects there would have been t distributed.
It was the Instruction left by him. Leo's
intimates say, . however, that, they know
that the testament begins with advice
about religion and morals and that it de T
Clares his firm intention to leave all he
possessed to the church, Including pres
ents, which might appear to be personal
property, on the ground that no one. could
claim anything he had during- life, as he
had generously provided for those bound
to him by the ties of blood and affection.
The report published in the United States
on the authority of the Tribuna here to
the effect that the will had been opened
by Cardinal Oreglia and that it showed
the Pope had left a private fortune of
$15,000,000 was premature, and was retract
ed in a later edition of the Tribuna itself.
BULES IFOB THE CONCLAVE.
At this morning's session of the congre
gation, when Cardinal Oreflia asked if
the conclave would be held in Rome, it is
said only Cardinals Martlnelll and Stein
huber objected on the ground of possible
influence of the Italian Government. Car
dinal Oreglia, who himself at the time of
the death of Pius IX had favored holding
the conclavfe outside of Italy, to-day de
clared that interference by the Italian
Government was impossible, and the pro
posal to hold the conclave in Rome was
carried unanimously. The congregation
decided that all participating in the
clave should not be allowed to hold com
munication of any kind with the outside
world.
In 1878 Cardinal Hohenlohe was permit
ted to have his meals sent from home,
through which medium, it has been al
leged, he notified Crispl, then Minister of
the Interior of Italy, and Prince Bismarck
about the proceedings of the conclave. '
It has been decided that cells occupied
by each Cardinal In the conclave shall be
chosen by lot.
Preparations for In e conclave have al
ready begun in the SIstlne Chapel, where
the balloting will take' place.
It Is said that an agreement has been
reached by the ecclesiastical and Govern
ment authorities to have the Italian
tioops enter St. Peter's should, any dis
turbance occur during any of the three
days 'that Leo will lie in state In the
chapel of the sacrament.

weeks more will see the organiza
tion that is doing so much to promote the
Interests . of Fresno' County and herald
her resources and opportunities abroad
comfortably installed in quarters of which
it may justly be proud.
For many years the chamber has talked
of having a building of its own, but it
remained for the present executive com
mittee, the most enterprising and ener
getic ever in control of the chamber, to
take up the actual work. This committee,
consisting of John A. Neu, president; G.
M. Boles, vice president; A. Frank Neate,
secretary; Leopold Gundelflnger, treas
urer, and C. F. Wyer, L. R. Payne, Wil
liam Robertson and C. Allison Telfer, was
elected last January and has accomplish
ed more In the six months it has been in
office than was accomplished for the
Chamber of Commerce in all the previous
years of- Its existence. . .
When the committee first went into of
fice the total membership of the cham
ber was less than 300. A membership
campaign was atonce instituted, with the
result that at present the list numbers
more than 700 names. Several big adver
tising schemes were inaugurated, the
principal one and one Involving, too, the
expenditure of several thousand dollars,
being the placing around every carton of
raisins shipped from here of a sheet of
raisin recipes with a wrlteup of Fresno
County on the reverse side. Exhibits were
â¢established and maintained in the San
Francisco ferry building, in Los Angeles,
in Chicago/one even as far away as Swe
den, and one also from which results have
already been felt,' at the recent national
encampment of Modern Woodmen at In
dianapolis. â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ .
But the most Important work undertak
en by the committee was the erection Of
this new bullding.^and the success of its
efforts Is shown by the handsome struc
ture now being built. The cost of the
new. building is upward of $10,000, all of
which was raised in a week's time by
popular subscription among, the business
men.- The- site selected is- In- the , city
park, adjoining the Southern Pacific de
pot, where the building will be surround
ed by a splendid lawn and; a. garden of
palms, shade trees, flowers and. shrub

The building faces on H street. It Is
in the Spanish mission style of architec

and is . of â¢ brick cemented with a yellow

devoted principally to the exhibit room,
where a fine display of the county's prod

On the trip out from San Francisco,
from which port the Ventura sailed on
June 4. the liner carried the London mails
cf May 23. The Ventura arrived here on
June 10 and landed the London mails in
Auckland on June 21, breaking the mail
transportation record from London to the
Antipodes by a considerable margin.
The return trip from Auckland to this
port was made in fast time and the com
mander of the Ventura expects to land
the Australian mails to San Francisco
on next Monday. The Ventura carries
133 passengers to the mainland. Great
inconvience and loss of time waÂ» cauced
here by reason of the fact that but four
inspectors were available to search the
baggage of passengers. Great indigna
tion is expressed at the treatment of the
passengers and the matter will doubt

LOS ANGELES, July 22.â The proposed
merger of the Farmers' and Merchants'
NatlonaTand the First National banks of
this city, the announcement of which last
Thursday created a commotion In Los An.
geles financial circles, is off.
The directors of the First National met
this afternoon and decided to abandon the
plan outlined in the circular, issued to
stockholders of the two banks last week.
This action was taken, it is said, in def
erence to. the objections made by some of
the heaviest stockholders to the proposed
consolidation. Vice President Kerckhoff
of the First National said to-day:
"We simply have ascertained that It is
the wish of our 'stockholders not to go
into any merger, and as directors we are
bound to regard their wishes. There will
be no consolidation."

Sumner on his return from ..Tahiti last
year was obliged to defend himself
against the attacks of relatives, who de
clared that he was insane and unable to
manage properly his large estate. Many
attorneys were engaged in the case and
prominent among these were ex-Judge
Humphreys and Frank Thompson. Sum
ner won his case, but was obliged to pay
$10,000 to the attorneys. Circuit Judge 'tie
Bolt in rendering his decision character
ized this phase of the suit as scandalous,
it having been alleged that Sumner's
money went to the lawyers who opposed
him as well as to those who represented
his interests. Disbarment suits were
brought against Humphreys and Thomp
son and the Supreme Court is now con
sidering the evidence submitted.
HONOLULU. July 22.â The scandal in
legal circles In connection with the Sum
ner case threatens to involve other attor
neys than those already Implicated. It is
stated that disbarment proceedings will
be instituted against a number of law
yers who drew large fees from John K.
Sumner. the aged capitalist, while he was
endeavoring to establish in the courts
fits competency to manage his affairs.
and the First National banks are the two
largest banks In Southern California, and
a consolidation, if It had been carried
out. would have given the consolidated
bank a capital of $2,000,000 and resources
of ttS.000.000.

ATTORNEYS FACE
GRAVE CHARGES
SOUTHERN BANKS
WILL NOT MERGE
One ground upon which Justice Caron
decided the merits of the controversy was
that the case Involved mere conspiracy;
that however serious ' the substantive
crimes were, the real charge upon which
the men had been tried here, and which
was Involved in the complaint preferred in
Canada, was conspiracy to commit the33
crimes and that conspiracy was not an
extraditable offense under the treaties.
Counsel for the United States earnestly
contended against this view, arguing that
the facts and the charges show that
Creene and Gaynor were actual partici
pants in the fraud of Captain Carter and
these substantive offenses and partici
pation in them were clearly covered by
the provisions of the extradition treaties
with England and by the laws of both
the United States and Canada. It is be
lieved that the Privy Council will sustain
this contention also.

sta.tir.tf that the application to the Privy
Council of England for leave to appeal
from the decision of Justice Caron cf
Quebec, discharging the accused, hai
been granted. The cablegram said that
the Lord Chancel. or in granting leave to
appeal stated that one Judge could not
Interfere with another In proceedings i;i
h seriou3 and important matter of th.3
iiature: that the offenses were clearly ex
traditable, and that while there was con
spiracy there also was something more.
Pending the examination of the accused
before an extradition commissioner ia
Canada, who was fully clothed with juris
diction, the ca^e was withdrawn from him
under applications of habeas corpu3 ani
was finally decided by Justice Caron anJ
the accused discharged. The L'niteJ
States. contended that the proceedings be
fore the extradition Judge could not thus
be Interfered with, and that view has
been sustained.
LONDON. July 22.â The case of tha
United States for extradition from Can
ada of John F. Gaynor and \V. D. Greene
came up to-day before the Privy Council
on the petition of the United States for
leave to appeal. Sir Edward Clarke, for
the petitioners, presented the case. Coun
sel, instructed by Charles Russell for the
respondents, said Important law poinU
were involved. The respondents noc only
welcomed but were anxious to have the
matter finally disposed of. though they
did not admit the statements in the pa
pers. The Lord Chancellor granted leav*
to appeal.

elected to the Kentucky Legislature. In

conventions that nominated General Har

died yesterday of ptomaine poisoning at
the home of her aunt, Mrs. Henry. Ter
ste&ge, on Sliver Hills, New Albany, op
posite to this city, on the Indiana side.
Mrs. Lake's death was directly due to
eating cherry pie on a dining car on June
30, just after leaving Seattle. She was at
the time proceeding from the coast to
New* Albany. Mrs. Lake at once became
ill, and the trip to Chicago was one of
intense agony. Mrs. Lake stopped there
for medical attention, but on July 4 start
ed, for New Albany. Her tongue and
throat were in such condition that she
could not talk. She steadily grew wcrse.
Mrs. Lake's mother, Mrs. Alice Layton,
of Reno, New, wired to-night to send the
body to Cincinnati for cremation.
It developed in the trial that Murphy's coun
sel will put in the <Iefcr.se that the funds he
ia charged with stealing were net leBitimate
riues and fines of the organization, but extor
tion money wrung from builders and contract
ors under threat. Counsel made thÂ« assertion
that one builder in Brooklyn bad beÂ«n forced
to pay the union men $10,001). Questions were
put by defendant's counsel to make it appear
that counsel was in possession of information
that in the l*st year over $200,000 baa been
paid to unions in this city by bosses and em
ployes for fines, assessments and "expenses."

together, when Thorman drew out, five
railroad bonds of ?100Q each and < said
he'd like to raise some money on them.
"McCoy volunteered to make the deal
and took the bonds," Goldsmith went on,
"but after that my client never saw him
again, _ although we went to his Broad

cently he learned that McCoy had put
the bonds with an automobile company
as security for a $3000 machine. "We got
the' summons only to-day.* If we can't
serve It to-night" we'll get a warrant to
morrow. We heard that the 'Kid' Is go

LECTURES ON POSTER
ARTISTS AND THEIR WORK
Barnett Franklin Gives Interesting
Talk Before the San Fran
cisco Architectural Club.
"Poster Artists and Their Work" was
the subject of a lecture last night at the
San Francisco Architectural Club In their
rooms at No. 14 McAllister street.
Barnett Franklin was the speaker of
the evening. He handled his subject In
a forceful manner and evidently with
thorough sympathy of the topic In ques
tion. He referred to the creations of
many of the famous poster artists,
making especial reference to the works
of such men a3 Mucha. Cheret, Penlield,
Nicholson. . Grasset ah^ that highly In
dividual and eccentric figure of the ar
tistic world. Aubrey Beardsley.
He said In part
"A poster is an epigram in color. The
greatest examples of architecture are the
ancient temples of the Greeks, and their
greatness lies in their, simplicity. So It
Is with the work of the true poster artist.
Simplicity, is the' keynote of the poster
art.. . ' Â¦ - ; ' . Â¦ " \t '- \:'. ] ''Â¦
"Posters have now come to enjoy a
commercal value. This has inspired the
poster artist to put forth his best en
deavors, and the result is the creation of
great beauty In design. that we now see
for the first time.. Until the poster vogue
set in art and commerce were far apart,
but now through this : poster medium
they are walking hand in hand to the
neutral advantage of both."
The lecture was Illustrated with some
fine reproductions of works j of famous
poster artists, and the talk was punctu
ated with humorous anecdotes, _ Inspired
by ' recollections of different prominent
artists Interested In the work. About
seventy-five' members of the club were

felony embezzlement, and was booked at

had embezzled $125.

possession signed by E. Hayden for the
amount. His son left the city at the time

Hayden should ask for Rosenthal's arrest

electric system about J150.000 would bâ¬
needed and that In order to get this
e mount of money it would be necessary
Hardly had the new schedule been In
augurated before the accidents occurred
and then the stockholders began to tflck.
As might naturally be expected, on Mana
ger Rank was laid the blame of the un
fortunate affairs which have utterly
spoiled the prospects of dividends for
many months to come. Stockholders,
without thoroughly Investigating the ac
cidentF. readily assumed that they were
due to T-oine mlsmary* gement. and Presi
dent Martin Is said to have also made
some remarks that were not pleasing to
his rnanacer.
STOCKHOLDESS INQUISITIVE.
The outcome was that Manager Rank,
supported by other officials of the road,
who thoroughly understand his position,
reminded Pres-ident Martin of their pro
test against his introduction of a new
time schedule and promptly passed the
rr.tire matter up to him. It was about
this time that the individual stockhold
ers were making Inquiries on their own
account as to why the road should have
been visited with so much misfortune.
With unpleasant feelings they recalled the
career of the road under the long admin
istration of J. B. Stetson and failed to
find in its hlstcry so many bad accidents
es had occurred during the very short
time the road had been in the hands of
its new owners.
Certainly, they Insisted, there must be
some cause for these accidents ajid in the
absence of some more satisfactory solu
tion they turned the blame upon Man
ager Rank. When, however, the man
ager and his assistants explained that
they had persistently opposed President
Martin's plan for faster trains and made
it apparent that they had been exerting
the bet=t possible care In the operation of
trains over the badly used roadbed, the
s-tockholders turned to President Martin
lor an explanation and then the quarrel-
Ing is said to have begun.
OPPOSED TO ASSESSMENT.
According to the story that Is going thÂ«
rounds. President Martin, eager to facili
tate traffic on his road, was the first to
suggest the change In the running sched
ule of the trains, which would decrease
the time from the terminals materially,
but the plan was strongly opposed by the
subordinate officials of the road on the
ground that the condition of the latter
would not warrant the Increasing of the
ppeed. Their opposition, however, was of
no avail and the new time schedule was
put In force against their protests.
A rpecla.1 meeting of Oe directors of the
North Shore road is called for this after
noon In the offices of JTesident John Mar
tin, In the Riallo bui'ding, and Its results
Â«re looked forward a> with deÂ«p Interest
by the heads of the different departments
of the road In this city. For several days
It has been comm-'n talk In railroad cir
cles that perfect harmony does not exist
among the directors as to how the rail
road across the bay should bo managed,
and it is also veil understood that Presi
dent John M: rtin and his assistants in
thÂ« operating department are also at va
riance upon Jie same subject. In fact. It
is learr.ed from a very reliable source that
Manager Rank has threatened to resign
and to this bit of Information has been
added the 6tory that President Martin,
anticipating such a move on the part of
his manager, has been quietly negotiating
for a competent man to fill the possible
vacancy. The present troubles are said
to antedate the recent series of accidents
along the road, but came to a climax
when the mishaps occurred.

BY the capture of Ciudad Bolivar Castro
has suppressed the last outbreak of rebellion
in Venezuela. He is now supreme, with no
one to dispute his power. Matos, who organized the
revolution, is a fugitive, and there is nothing in sight
to disturb the Monkey of the Andes in his career as
supreme dictator. His misgovernment, which is
acute, cannot be ascribed as the cause of the late
revolution, though it gained recruits for his enemy.
Nor was there any patriotism in his defense, since it
was put forth onl;- to protect himself and not to save
his country. Taking power by revolution himself,
he sought it not to better administration of the gov
ernment, but to enrich himself. Those who lately
fought against him had the same motive, and whether
they won or lost, the country had no hope of bet
terment.
This is the cheerless feature in the history of most
of the Latin-American states. When a revolution
starts in any of them our people are alert and sym
pathetic. The revolutions among Anglo-Saxons
have nearly always been for the advancement of
principles, to make the people more secure in their
rights of person and property and to give them a
larger share in the government. In this way liberty
was advanced to the far frontier that was reached
when our Revolution of 1776 ended in the establish
ment of a self-governing republic. But the Latin-
American revolutions are simply robber raids, land
piracy on a considerable scale, and are not intended
to make government any better, but usually make it
worse. Castro's rule in Venezuela "is the most cor
rupt that country has had. He is" a villain of the
worst kind, but he is typical of the rulers of most
of those states.
A recent writer in the .North American Review
has defended him by admitting all of his scarlet
crimes, but showing that he is no worse than kings
were in Europe three centuries ago. That is no de
fense. In the sixteenth and even the seventeenth
century government was monarchical; the doctrine
of divine right of kings was everywhere held and
believed, and .the appalling cloud of the dark ages
had not yet passed away. Since then the doctrine
of divine Tight is discredited and government every-
CASTRO'S VICTORY.
Oakland is making determined and thus far suc
cessful effort to rid herself of grogshops and evil re

shore.
FROM Washington comes the report that the
Government has established in the center of the
cane-growing district of Georgia a plant for the
purpose of teaching the Georgians how to make cane
syrup. It would seem that in this venture the Agri
cultural Department is undertaking to teach its
grandmother to suck eggs. Georgians of the cane
district were making syrup, from cane juice not only
before the Department of Agriculture was born, but
before there was any United States Government to
beget such a department. It happens, however, that
in the development of the new-fashioned scientific
way of making sugar the Georgians lost the art of
making a really good molasses, and now the Gov
ernment has to go down to the cane lands and teach
the present generation the lost art of their fathers.
Genuine cane syrup when served with hot cakes
or waffles makes a dish fit for gods. There is a
story that a distinguished French statesman, diploma
tist and epicure was once entertained at the White
House and given a breakfast composed principally of
waffles made by Dolly Madison herself, then the pre
siding lady at Washington, and he was so delighted
with the delicacy that he then and there swore by the
blue ribbon of the great chefs that France and Amer
ica should be friends forever.
Old-fashioned cane syrup vanished before the in
vention of a process of extracting virtually all the
sugar from the cane juice, leaving none for the syrup,
and before the deadly competition of the sophisti
cated syrup made of glucose and sulphuric acid. Men
who can remember the good old syrup of bygone
times have regretted the loss of it more than any
other loss brought about by the advancement of
science and the decadence of humanity. Ill fares the
land, to hastening ills a prey, where frauds accumu
late and pure foods pass away.
The Government is doing a great service in un
dertaking to revive the pure cane syrup industry.
When that has been accomplished there will remain
one thing more for the Department of Agriculture
to do, and that is to revive the ancient industry of
making wholesome hot cakes. The men and the
women of future generations will rise up and call us
blessed if we preserve from destruction those high
bred delicacies of the great days of the republic when
Presidents wore knee breeches and when the mis
tress of the White House, renowned for beauty, wit,
elegance and taste, could with her own hands bake
waffles for gallant gentlemen from the courts of
Europe. .

to make local politics sizzle. A
month ago It would have been impossible
to predict who would be the next Mayor
of Sacramento. That was when Mayor
George H. Clark was still undecided as
to whether he would enter the race for a
third term or would accompany his busi
ness partner, A. P. Booth, to San Fran
cisco.
But things have greatly changed since
then. Clark will soon become a resident
of San Francisco and his unique personal
ity will cease to figure in Sacramento pol
itics. If Clark had stayed here and sought
a third term as Mayor he would have
run as an independent candidate, as he
did two years ago. And he would havo
given his opponent a run for his money,
there Is no doubt of that, even in the
minds of his political enemies. For
Clark's personality is engaging and he
has long been credited with the ability
to smile away the most threatening op
position.
But now Clark Is out of the running,
and the field seems clear for the prospec
tive Republican and Democratic â¢ candi
dates. Tho former, It is believed, will
certainly be Albert Elkus, present presi
dent of the Board of Trustees. To Wil
liam J. Hassell, the last Democratic can
didate for Railroad Commissioner and an
esteemed citizen, will, from present indi
cations, fall the honor of leading the
Democratic forces. As the town Is largely
Republican the chances favor the elec
tion of the nominee of that party, and so
Elkus is brought prominently to the
front. Clark is in the East now and El
kus is the acting Mayor. He has taken
hold of the reins with a firm grip and his
course will be watched with interest. He
has made a splendid record as Trustee,
having been to the- forefront in every not
able reform and having performed his
duties with a seemingly total disregard
for the enemies he might make among
those who like to wield hammers around
election time.
A rather unfortunate condition of af
fairs exists in the Board of Trustees,
without whose aid, under the existing
charter, the Mayor is powerless to act.
Every important move of the Mayor must
receive the indorsement of a majority of
the Trustees before it can become ef
fective. There should be, under the
charter, nine Trustees, one from, each
TELLS OF HIS LABORS
AT NATIONAL CAPITAL
SACRAMKNTO. July 22.â Hundreds
of people are upending the sum
mer at the seaside and mountain
resorts, but there are" plenty left
WITHIN* the last month two negroes have
been lynched by negroes, and one barely es
caped the same fate.
In Wyoming two white murderers were lynched by
ranchers, who in the haste of administering that sort
of justice killed a deputy Sheriff. The ranchers
pleaded the law's delay and the fear that the red
handed men would finally go free. One of the vic
tims had murdered his own brother and the guilt was
fully established, yet they fattened in jail while tech
nical attorneys used the resources of the law to get
them off.
The most interesting fact in these late developments
is the tendency of negroes to imitate white men in
Uk-r.g the law into their own hands. It is an ex
tension of the demoralizing tendency of the prac
tice, if it spread among the negroes a new element
is added to the problem, for they meet but little op
position from the whites when they desire to wreak
v?r.j;e.:nce upon their own kind.
The lynching ranchers of Wyoming can point to
many precedents for their acts. The delays of jus
tice in Cincinnati had become so notorious that not
many years ago a mob in that city cleaned out the
jail and wrecked the courthouse, not only executing
several condemned murderers but chasing their at
torneys out of town. In looking for proximate
causes of lynching delays in justice must be con
sidered. An accused man is entitled to a fair trial
and full defense. But when he has had these the
prolongation of his case by resort to legal technicali
ties tends to exhaust public patience and lead to re
sults which create disrespect for all law. When a
condemned man whose guilt is proved is the bene
ficiary of an undotted i or an uncrossed t in his in
dictment, or is given a new trial for mispunctuation
in the Judge's charge, the principle of a fair trial
is stretched to the limit. Yet such prolongation of
the defense is common, and there is a class of law
yers who seek to prove their mettle by a resort to
Bach methods.
When considering the problem of prevention oJE
lynching it is well to include in the discussion such
revision of our criminal laws and court procedure as
will define more clearly the rights of a* condemned
man 2nd so limit them as to be consistent with justice
to him and also to the public affected by his crime.
Criminal practice is one of the great specialties of
the legal professron, and the increase of crime renders
it of first importance to the community. Surely it is
possible to make full and complete defense of an
accused man consistent with the rights of society.
Those rights are abridged by the present system of
delay by technicality. It is to be noted that the
cases in which technicality is resorted to are usually
those in which the guilt seems to be most plainly
proved. Given such a condition, and all the mate
trial is supplied for exhaustion of public patience and
such a degree of exasperation as leads to the awful
It is true that the lynching habit, once started, soon
reaches a point where the law's delay cannot be
pleaded, for the law has had no chance at all. If the
crime is brutal and exasperating it is expiated on the
spot by the act of a mob. This is especially true of
Southern lynchings, in communities where justice
would be swift and delays by technicalities would
not be permitted. The orderly way of reaching the
whole solution is, however, in establishing speedy
justice in place of the habitual delay. When this is
done, and one cause of lynching is eliminated, the
other elements of the frightful problem may be taken
tip in their order. One of th?m is the visiting of
prompt punishment upon ilie lynchers, when it is
possible. But we have found out in the Modoc cases
in this State that when a whole community is in
sympathy with ths crime, and the State is denied
a change cf venue, punishment of the t guilty is im
possible. In such cases perjury is resorted to to
shield the guilty, with general public approval. Such
communities may have to be left immersed in their
semi-barbarism until immigration or education works
their reform.

the whole range of Western interests, but attention,
will be directed mainly to the commercial relations,
of the Pacific Coast with the Orient, and conse
quently California will be largely concerned in the
proceedings.
It is the desire of the executive committee to make
the congress thoroughly representative of the West,
and accordingly the call for delegates is liberal. Con
cerning representation the official circular says:
"The Governor of each State or Territory may ap
point ten delegates. The Mayor of each city one
delegate and one additional delegate for each 5000
inhabitants; provided, however, that no city shall
have more than ten delegates. Each county may ap
point one delegate through its executive officer.
Every business organization one delegate and one ad
ditional delegate for every fifty members; provided,
however, that no such organization shall have more
than ten delegates. Governors of States and Terri
tories, members of the United States Congress and
ex-presidents of this congress are ex-officio delegates,
with all privileges of delegates except those of vot
ing. Lists of delegates should be addressed to
Arthur F. Francis, secretary, Cripple Creek, Colo
rado."
During the last decade these congresses have oc
cupied an important place in current history. They
have had a marked influence in promoting Western
interests a'nd in advancing legislation designed to
benefit the great region west of the Mississippi. With
the prestige acquired by past labors and successes
the future of the' congress will doubtless be even more
notable than the past; the spirit of Western co
operation will of course be increased by the associa
tion of leading men in these assemblies, and the in
fluence of the congress will correspondingly augment.
It is to be hoped that California will be strongly
represented at the Seattle meeting. Our interests in
the trade of the Orient are larger than those of any
other State, and, moreover, we are directly con
cerned in every movement that tends to upbuild the
Great West. The Trans-Mississippi Congress has es
tablished itself as a distinguished factor in Western
development and should have the cordial support of
California as well as of other States west of the
TRANS-MISSISSIPPI CONGRESS.
. Some of the reports from the Orient indicate that
China, in her affairs With her foes, is treacherous as
well as weak. This discovery should be gratifying
to the nations that are not in the robber class, as it
proves at least that the Celestial Kingdom is not al
together helpless. Treachery ought to be a legitimate
weapon against brute force.

IT was feared that Mr. Bryan was to be lost to cur
rent politics as a picturesque feature. This fear
has passed. He has been the guest of the Chi
cago Democracy at a sort of park picnic, and has
poured the vials of his vitriolic wrath upon Cleveland
and all his works and friends and record, and upon
all his friends' friends and them and their record.
The occasion seems to have been made exclu
sively for Mr. Bryan, for it was on July 18, not a
saint's day in the Democratic calendar and a date
not brought into historical prominence, except by
one incident. It is believed to be the day on which
Eric Raspe died. The name Raspc suggests nothing,
until the reader is informed that he was the author
of "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen." Prob
ably none of the officers of the Chicago Democracy
were aware of this coincidence, but sometimes events
order themselves regardless of the actions of man,
and there is, after all, something appropriate in
bringing Munchausen and Bryan together.
In his speech he delighted thousands of listeners
by lathering Mr. Cleveland with aquafortis and
shaving him with a handsaw. In the hot Chicago
air he "put the spur to metaphor until it sweat like
a carthorse hauling a load of coal, and worked in
vective until that oratorical resource looked sway
backed under the burden. His political bile was of
some weeks' accumulation, and the Iowa convention
seems to have been the liver pill that started it
flowing with a freedom that threw his audience into
spasms of admiration and approval.
Even the fact that at that very moment Mr. Cleve
land was engaged in the parental formality of receiv
ing an addition to his family, and a son at that,
failed to stay Mr. Bryan's pointed tongue. He per
haps took it as another evidence of the ex-Presi
dent's subservience to Republican teachings, inas
much as it seemed to be an indorsement of Presi
dent Roosevelt's ideas on race suicide. So he smote
his former leader and bruised him hip and thigh
through the hot afternoon.
He declared that Mr. Cleveland's last administra
tion had not been disinfected by time, but is still a
stench in the nostrils of the people, and that it was
more subservient to Wall street than any Republi
can administration that had preceded it. Its odium
was declared the cause of the speaker's defeat for the
Presidency in 1896. By set forms of speech he cast
Cleveland and all who follow him into outer dark
ness. He said that he repudiated the object of his
wrath in 1896. but complete as that solemn act was
it did not thoroughly disinfect the party. His
speech abounded in "bulwarks, entrenchments,
threats, paralysis, monopolists, barons, millstones"
and other oratorical ammunition of the most destruc
tive sort. He was followed by Mayor Reed of Kan
sas City; Sullivan, the party candidate for Governor
of Iowa; Mr. Campau of Detroit and Mr. Ryan of
Wisconsin, all of whom, it may be taken for granted,
indorsed and approved his dish of vitriol.
This event seems to destroy the last hope of get
ting the Democratic party together, for it seems to
have been the deliberate intention of Mr. Bryan to
serve notice that he is, for inharmony first, last and
all the time. As far as the country is concerned it
is notice that under no circumstances can the gov
ernment be given, to a party that is at such bitter
and uncompromising war with itself. When a man
goes around exhibiting his imperfections and inflict
ing wounds upon himself he is not employed by
others in a position of trust. So it is with an organi
zation. When it bawls to the world that in its own
opinion the last time it was trusted it became a
stench and a public nuisance and menace so pro
nounced that it is not disinfected after being six' years
in quarantine and under the fumigation of Mr. Bry
an's verbal formaldehyde, no amount of reorganiza
tion is able to fit it to receive public confidence and
have put upon it another great trust.
It will furnish the comedy in the next campaign;
for which, thanks. It is not well to be too serious in
our politics, and though Mr. Bryan casts himself
for tragedy parts, he is' the clown and comedian to
relieve the situation by doing political 'comedy. By
all means let him stay in political vaudeville, so
that we may have a laugh as we go on with the se
rious business of keeping the Government in good
and safe hands.

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 23, 1903.
There has been a general awakening
along progressive lines in Sacramento and
the people are demanding that the of
ficial positions shall be filled by men of
force and ability, who can aid the city
in the forward movement.
These questions were gone over very
fully at a recent meeting of the West
End Improvement Club and several prop
erty owners spoke of the need of having
the ward represented. It Is true a new
member would in any event take his seat
in six months, but the residents would
prefer to have a man appointed to the
place now who would indicate, between
now and election time whether he should
be retained by their votes. ,.-,*
Among the candidates for election at
the polls for the trusteeship from the
ward are Edward Leitch and George
Radovich. The Kent family are among
the oldest and best respected residents
of the ward and should Mayor Clark ap
point one of the brothers of R. E. Kent
to the place the appointee would, it is
thought by many, stand a good chance
for retention in the office by the voters
of the ward.
â¢ward. This number was chosen at the
election, but for several months the Sec
ond Ward has not been represented, ow
ing to the continued illness of Trustee R.
E. Kent. His term will expire on January
1 next and It Is not thought that he will
reclaim his seat meanwhile.
This leaves a populous ward of the city
unrepresented at a time when many Im
portant measures concern it. A plan, was
recently put into effect isolating the fall
en women resident on a certain street in
the ward and this has brought to the
surface several questions in which the
people of the ward are concerned. Again,
a movement is on foot to declare open
several miles of streets in the Second
Ward, which have long been closed to the
public, and a representative of the ward
in the Board of Trustees would wield
great influence In behalf of the people in
the matter.

City Engineer Grunsky completed plans
yesterday for the repair and Improvement
of accepted streets, for which work the
question of Issuing bonds is to be sub
mitted to the electors In September. It
Is estimated by the City Engineer, that
$1,621,000 will be required for the construc
tion- of. the required modem pavements.
The following statement in connection
with the plans was Issued by the City.
Engineer:
It Is proposed to replace the cobblestone
pavements on streets -of light gradients, as
well 'as 'the worn-out pavements, notably those
in the downtown or business section of the city,
with new pavements.
' The work of pavement repair and reconstruc
tion will not, however, be conrtned to any par
ticular district. Although most of it lies east
of Van Ness avenue on the north side of M5r
kct street and east of Ninth street on the south
elde of Market, some of it will extend far out
from the business center of the city on main
lines of travel.. To the extent that traffic con
ditions will : permit, the smooth-surfaced as
phalt or bituminous . rock pavement Is recom
mended , for use. "
A list of the streets to be repaved or repaired,
showing type of pavement to be used, forms a
part of the City Engineer's report. Among the
streets enumerated, aside from those of the
business section of th* city, may be named:
Valencia street from Eighteenth to Mission,
Sixteenth street from Folsom to Valencia,
Golden Gate avenue â¢ from Market^ street to
Cough and from Laguna to Scott. Fillmore
street from Bush to ' California, Montgomery
avenue from Washington street to Filbert, Van

money received from the State, the city
and individual contributors are published.
Sums allowed for the several functions,
parades and for the decoration and Illum
ination of the city are specified. The
allowance of $20,000 to execute W. R. Hew
itt's magnificent design of a grand arch
was made on the principle that the beau
tiful spectacle would afford universal de
light to men, women and children of 'the
city anil to all visitors. The argument
was, "The people expect a splendid fea
ture which will not be reserved for the
privileged few, but one which all may
view." It is the Judgment of electrical
experts that the arch. In point of mag
nitude and harmony of design, will sur
pass anything of its character ever pre
sented in the United States.
In order to render the scheme effective
and as a precautionary measure against
an Immense and constant crush at "news
paper corners." Market street for sev
eral blocks on either side of the grand
arch should be illuminated. An additional
sum of $5000 may be required for support-
Ing illumination.

Passenger agents of the different trans
continental and connecting roads report
that the travel expected for the approach
ing encampment will be the heaviest ever
known, and will tax every road to the ut
most of its capacity. More special trains
have been chartered for the event than
has ever been known. Even the delega

arranged to have their own specials, and
in some instances it will require qu'ito a
large train to accommodate delegation*
from the most distant points.
The Department of Oklahoma has se

OKLAHOMA HEADQUARTERS.
Katzauer served a term of eighteeen
months in San Quentln for smuggling, so
the records at police headquarters show.
He was* received at the penitentiary on
February 17, 1896. having been convicted
in the United States District Court.
in which he calls attention to the fact
that it is necessary for as many comrades
to attend the National Encampment In
San Francisco as possible. Delegates who
may be prevented from making the Jour
ney are instructed to at once notify the
assistant adjutant general In order that
an alternate may be notified to take the
place. The Illinois Central to Omaha
has been selected as the official route for
the department, going to Denver, Salt
Lake City and San Francisco via the
Southern Pacific, arriving here at 10 a. m.,
Friday. August 14. Comrades will Join
the headquarters at all points on the Illi
nois Central and those arriving at Oma
ha on other trains will join the special
leaving Omaha at 11:30 on Saturday even-
Ing, August 8. There will also be a spe
cial through Grand Army train of Pull
man tourist sleepers, which will be ac
companied by Assistant Adjutant General
George A. Newman, leaving Des Molnes
August 10 over the Chicago, Rock Island
and Pacific, connecting at Denver with
the Denver and Rio Grande to Salt Lake,
thence to San Francisco. Department
Commander Raymond thus appeals to the
veterans, urging them to Join In ihe Dil
grimage to California:
Comrades, this Is to be a memorable encamp-'
ment In more ways than one. It is tb; 's&t
probably that will be held on the Pacific Coast,
and the comrades in San Francisco are making
arrangements that are perfectly dazzling in
their magnificence. Headquarters will be
opened at the Palace Hotel, August 17, where
all comrades and visitors will receive a cordial
welcome.
Detective Ryan was called into the case
and he and Lewln visited Katzauer's
store with a search warrant and found
a lot of cigars of both the stolen brands.
When Katzauer was questioned he said
he could not remember the man from
whom he purchased the cigars and ex
pressed ignorance of any knowledge that
they had been stolen. His explanation
was unsatisfactory and he was placed un
der arrest.
On April 8 a case was stolen from a
car containing 1000 cigars of the brand
"S. P. Hotel Favorites" and 1000 "L*ne
& Connelly Victors." These were manu
factured exclusively by Lane & Connelly
for the S. P. Hotel at Yuma, Arls. On
Monday a visitor from Yuma dropped Into
Katzauer's store and bought a cigar. He
was surprised to see it branded "S. P.
Hotel Favorites," and expressed his sur
prise to an official .of the railroad com
pany.
Ever since February cases containing
many thousands of cigars have been oc
casionally stolen from cars on trains go
ing out of the city. All . the Southern
Pacific detectives on this division have
been engaged for months in an endeavor
to trace the thieves, but they failed.
Employes of the company were the sus
pects, but the thefts were so cleverly
done that no trace of the culprits could
be found. v'Â»:
Max Katzauer, proprietor of a cigar
store at Third and Townsend streets, was
arrested yesterday morning by Detective
sergeant Ryan and Detective Lewln of
the Southern Pacific Company, and book
ed a* the City Prison on a warrant from
Police Judge Conlan's court charging him
with receiving stolen property. Ho was
released later on $200 cash bail.
Attorney Johnson has another story to
tell, however, of the connection between
Balfour, Guthrie & Co. and the Howard
warehouses. He says that he expects to
be able to prove that the warehouse man
agement is in the habit of disposing of
the grain recovered from the sweepings
to Balfour, Guthrie & Co. at prices much
below the market quotations and that it
presumably shares In the profits of these
transactions by which the customers are
deprived of proper returns on the recov
ered grain, which rightfully belongs to
them.
Balfour, Guthrle & Co. are named as
co-defendants in the case and Attorney
Johnson states that they were included
because it was believed that they were
the actual owners of the warehouses in
question. This is denied at the offices of
the latter firm, who say that they own
considerable stock In the warehouse com
pany, but have absolutely nothing to do
with its management.
When cleaning up time comes we dispose of
the sweepings and divide the amount received
pro rata among the customers who have had
grain in our warehouses . during the period In
which the sweeping accumulated. We em
ployed the usual procedure In regard to the
barley deposited by Horst and tendered him a
check for his share of the recovered grain
which he refused to accept. That is all there
Is to the case and the bringing of this suit Is
not worrying us In the least. *
John L. Howard, president of the How
ard Company admits that two pounds of
grain was abstracted from every five
sacks to cover leakage and said that the
custom was universal among grain ware
houses. He added:
HOWARD TVrATnre DENIAL.
As a matter of fact. Instead of a warehouse
abstracting grain from the sacks of its de
positors "as a matter of protection," It should
allow them to share in the increase, which I
am informed accrues to all grain In warehouses.
As far as. I can see there can be no actual loss
in grain when it is once In a warehouse. Ther*
tnav bÂ« a certain percentage of leakage In the
sacks, but all this is regained In the sweep
ings, which are appropriated by the ware
houses. Hence any loss In the weight of the
sacks Is regained in the sweepings, which In
large storage runs up into tons and tons of
grain.
Whether or not It Is a custom for warehouses
to make deduction from grain actually deliv
ered to them "aa a matter of protection," to
quote Mr. Howard, I do not know, but if It is,
then the custom Is Indefensible. My client's
attention was first attracted to the shortage
in weights reported by the persons to whom
he sold the grain. Then he began his Investi
gation and satisfied himself that barley had
been abstracted from the sacks stored by him
in the Howard warehouses. 8lx months after
he had ceaced to do business with the Howard
Company and after repeated solicitations on his
part for an equitable settlement of the short
age, he was tendered a check for $12U0, which
he refusrti. Then the suit was commenced.
After obtaining this Information my client
approached John L. Howard, president of the
defendant corporation, and demanded restitu
tion for the grain of which he was unjustly de
prived. Howard then admitted to him that
two pounds was deducted from every five sacks
of barley in the returns on the weighing In of
the grain and gave as a reason for that ex
traordinary noceedlng that such was the cus
tom among warehouses "as a matter of protec
tion."
. CONFIDENT OF OUTCOME.
1 We have brought this suit after a thorough
investigation by my client, lasting over a pe
riod of six months, during which he has satis
fied hlmeelf that he was defrauded out of large
quantities of craln deposited by him In the
warehouses of the Howard Company at Oak
land. How and where he obtained his Infor
mation we do not deem It advisable to disclose
at this time, but It Is of such a positive char
acter as to lead us to believe that we shall be
able to prove our contention without the
shadow of a doubt when the case shall come to
trial.
Hiram Johnson, attorney for Horst, de
clares that the investigation instituted by
his client and extending over a period of
six months has shown that the Howard
Company in its warehouses in Oakland
removed from the sacks of barley placed
In storage there by Horst an average of
3.43 pounds from each sack and appropri
ated this grain to lta own, use. Attorney
Johnson said yesterday: }
The amount we sue for represents $4500 worth
of barley removed from the sacks belonging
to my client, together with $900 for weighing
charges, which we repudiate because the re
turns on the weighing were admittedly false,
and $600 expended In ascertaining- these facts
and bringing suit against the Howard Com
pany. From the information In our possession
we are satisfied we can prove In a court of
law our right to the foregoing sums.
Following so closely upon the heels of
the Epplnger scandal, the suit brought
by H. Clemmens Horst, the dealer In hops
and barley, against the Howard Company
for alleged shortage In .weight In 88,000
sacks of barley delivered to the ware
houses of the defendant , company, by
which plaintiff claims to have been dam
aged to the amount of $G000, has created
consternation among those who make a
business of Belling, buying and shipping
grain. If the contentions of the plaintiff
in the present suit can be sustained
grain men will be likely to lose altogether
that childlike faith they have held in
warehouses and their system, the fallibil
ity of which was severely tested by the
scandalous disclosure in the Eppinger
failure.

"HOME, SWEET HOME."
The Old Homestead.
BY HENRY P. SMITH.
Free Oil Painting
With Next Sunday's Call.
There is nothing in the wide, wide world quite so appealing as home.
Be it ever so humble there is no spot like the habitation of the individual
man. Rich or poor, high or low, good or bad, prince or pauper, the in-
clination is for home, and any picture that represents home ties or home
features touches the warmest spot in the hearts of all men and women.
Apropos of this, The San Francisco Call presents as its art supple-
Â¦ ment next Sunday an oil painting which is a perfect reproduction in color
of the celebrated picture by Henry P. Smith entitled "The 'Old Home-
stead." It represents a New England farmhouse and possesses artistic
qualities of the highest order. Its composition is well balanced, its color
harmonious and there is a satisfying fidelity in the completeness with
which the details are elaborated. There is an element of outdoors in the
whole beautiful scheme. The farmhouse, with its antique, cozy character,
\ its great elm tree in front, its rich greens surrounding and its sir oi
s shade, comfort and coziness are peculiarly attractive.
Smith, the artist, is one of the most successful of New York pic-
ture-makers and he is one of the most cultivated men in the art world.
Hitherto he has devoted himself largely to Venetian scenesâ pictures of
architectural wonders of the Old World. The present effort is an innora*
tion; it passes from the grandeur of Granada and Seville to the homely
comforts of a New England homestead. The change shows great versatil-
ity in the artist and has in it an atmosphere that is peculiarly graceful
and charming.
California readers will be especially interested in this attractive pic-
ture of Eastern homeliness and natural luxury, conveying as it does a de-
licious sense of coolness that seems to exude from the canvas,

ELASTIC POINTER WINS
RICH STAKE AT. DETROIT
fight. ' \
"From what I have read and heard of
the Jeffries-FitzBlmmons fight," said
Ryan yesterday, "I am' led to believe Jef
fries has gone back 100 per cent. Fitz
simmons hit him at will, which he could
not do in their previous fight.
"He does not seem to be training for
speed at the present time,- although he
requires that quality more than any
other. In his New York fight with Cor
bett he was trying his best all the time
and was outpointed up to the time he
landed the knockout blow. With Corbett
vastly Improved and Jeffries apparently
not as good as he was at that time I can
see but one outcome to the tight."
Ryan has been a sufferer from stomach
trouble for some years and will try the
curative qualities of some of the" mineral
springs for which this State is celebrated.
Corbett weighed 185 pounds in ring cos
tume yesterday after he . had . gone
through his morning's work in the gym
nasium. He counts on ., Jeffries, trying a
slugging style in their fight. .'He will 'not
carry the fight to the champion, but will
devote all his energies to outpointing him.
To this end he is training to keep on the
move every instant of the time he is in
the ring with Jeffries. This, will- afford
the latter a difficult mark at which to hit.
\, It is generally understood Â¦ that Ryan,
who has no superior in ring generalship,
will be Corbett's \ chief advisor when he
meets Jeffries in the ring on. August 14.
He is the man who is credited with hav
ing made the greatest improvement in
Jeffries when he was training in the East
for some of his most important battles.
The two champions then had a disagree
ment, but Ryan says this does not give
him a biased point of view of the coming
Tommy Ryan, the middleweight cham
pion boxer, was the star visitor yesterday
at James J. Corbett's training quarters at
Alameda. Ryan was amazed at the im
provement in Corbett's physical condition
and came away wlth^the firm conviction
that he will defeat Jeffries.
Sixty-four greyhounds will go into the

BRIGHTON BEACH. July 22.â The Mon
tauk stakes, for two-year-olds, worth
5C335 to the winner, went to Longshot.
from the stable of Julius Fleischmann.
The colt was unbacked, however, it is
said on excellent authority, because it
was believed that the distance was too far
for him. Longshot, which is a good-look
ing son of Indio, was lucky to win, be
cause The Southerner, after having been
bumped at the start by \ Juvenal Maxim,
thereby losing ten lengths, was beaten by
only a short head.
Odom 6a- ve admirers just cause for
another demonstration in his favor after
his hard-earned success on Andy Wll
l;ams, which repeated his victory of the
dav before. To be sure, he had two in
experienced riders in little O'Brien and
Connell flanking him on the left and
light, respectively, yet it required Odom's
Lest efforts to land his mount first by a
ehort head, with Daisy Green second, the
eame distance in front of Lady Potentate,
which was forced to make a rather wide
turn into the stretch.
Tribes Hill, one of the beaten horses,
was claimed by William Midgely for *17M.
In the last race of the day Gaviota, the
clever California lilly, earned brackets for
hÂ«-r owner, a daughter of "Billy" Oliver.

SUMMARY.
Even Dolly, with all his strength, size
and motion, did not make good to any
alarming degree. He got his bumps and
got them hard at times. So hard wms he
hit in the seventh and eighth that flvo
tallies and seven good bingles resulte<l
and. after that the game was at an end
and the Angels outside the money limit.
Little Lindsey was not what he was
expected to be. Uncle had been savin?
him for weeks, so that he could go in and
mystify the men from the south, but
vlth the mysteries he was not there.
Tbey found him and found him hard at
times. _But good batting rallies came to
the rescue of the tiny southpaw and they
saved him when he seemed all but In.

Mr. Drinkwatcr started to do the toss-
Ing up act for the crowd from the trop
ics. He could not go the route after the
fifth spasm had opened with a storm oC
base hits and runs threatening, so Di
rector General Dillon ordered the young
man to scat himself beneath the bench,
and Dolly Gray was trotted out to stay
the tide.
STANDING OF THE CX.UB3.
(Pacific Coast League.) u p
There were enough base hits torn off
yesterday and enough runs coming con
tinually over the rubber to win many ball
games. In fact, the way the game pro
gressed came as a gentle reminder of tha
old days when runs and bingles were far
more plentiful than they are In these ad
vanced times. None of the fans were
sorry even If a gigantic score was rolled
up, for Uncle's tribe landed oftener than
the stars of the southern climes and were
winners, 9 to 6.
It was the first game of thirteen be
tween the topllners of the league and It at
tracted much attention among the lovers
of the national pastime. The members oÂ£
both teams were more nervous and anx
ious than they generally appear, but
withal they handled themselves with
more than ordinary grace. What -was
lacking in coolness was made up in ag
gressiveness and gameness.
To Meany. Irwin and Leahy belong tha
credit of the palm of victory. At every
available moment, when an anxious play
er rested on the bags and longed to cro^ss
the rubber, one of these gentlemen was
willing and anxious to come through with
a base hit and gratify the wish of the
base runner. Of the thirteen hits made
by the home team, four are credited to
Leahy and three each to Irwin and
Meany.
Danny Shay was also in evidence, es
pecially on the bags. Danny got to first
on passes twice and each time completed
the circuit. The remainder of the seven
runs 'were scored by Meany, Irwin and
Leahy, so they came near being the real
cream cheese all the time.

Whenever a sore or ulcer is slow in healing then you may be sure
something is radically wrong with your blood. Some old taint or poison
that has been slumbering there for years, is beginning to assert itself,
and breaks out and becomes a bad ulcer and perhaps the beginning of
Cancer. These old sores are rooted in the blood, and while washes, soaps,
salves, etc, keep the surface clean, they are not healing. A blood

A fire that entailed a loss of fully $5000
broke out shortly after 7 o'clock last night
in the establishment of the Pacific Cloak
and Suit J House at 1142 Market I street.
The blaze had Its lnclplency in the west
eide of the basement among a large num
ber of fancy suits and the greatest loss
was occasioned by smoke and water. An
alarm, was sounded from box 95 and upon
the arrival of the firemen at the scene
an Immense volume of smoke was issu
ing from the basement.
Several streams were soon playing upon
the names and the fire was under control
in a short time. The origin of the fire
can only be a matter of conjecture, but
it is supposed that a lighted cigarette,
thrown away by a careless employe, was
the cause. M. Slrninoff is the proprietor

BERKELEY, July 22.-Mrs. James T.
Landregan, proprietor of the California
Hotel, thinks she is the victim of a plot
to kill her and blow her hotel into smith
ereens. She says that last Sunday morn
ing about 3 o'clock some one entered her
doorway and iinscrewed the . gas pipe
leading to the pas Jet there, thus allowing
the gas to escape in copious quantities.
Fortunately for the hotel and its thirty
guests, Mrs. Landregan heard a noise and
upon investigating found the break. The
services of, a plumber were soon after
ward obtained and the leak plugged up.
Mrs. Landregan thinks the pereon who
unscrewed the pipe did it in the hope of
filling the hotel with gas and having her
guests asphyxiated by the wholesale or
having the gas ignite and blow them to
pieces. She believes also that the mis
creant is the same person who tried to set
fire to the hotel a while ago, after some
trouble with him.

To-night the streets were given up to a

The teacher should have an already accu
1 Emulated wealth of knowledge, constantly ac
cumulating. He ought to be master of his
subject. I have to work hardest on the things
I don't Â«ay. I never teach up to the edge of
my eubject for fear of falling off. The con
vene* of the teacher creates the Impres
sion of largeness in the subject and he must
work with a big background. I was not con
vinced that there should be & graduate school
at Harvard until President Eliot said that
â¢the teaching here will never be satisfactory
until the students are convinced that there Is
no limit to the teaching." The graduate
school has been the most ennobling factor that
has ever come to Harvard. .
The po w er of ennobling through life is es
sential. Knowledge buffets. Every fragment
of knowledge is repulsive, yet this fragmentary
condition is inevitable. A child can not un
derstand this and his confidence In knowledge
â¢ must fcÂ« restored by the teacher.
The teacher inurt train himself to forget
himself. The desire for praise is common but
it certainly can have no place In the makeup
cf the teacher. The teacher is a colorless
medium through which the child Is brought to
i look on truth. It Is the teacher's greatest
compliment to be passed by. It Is futile for
i attempt to trace results. The teacher casts
1 his bread upon the waters â It may return.
Vicariousness must be wrought in the teach
er's moral fiber. He must not enter teach
ing because he loves books, for a teacher's
work is not in obtaining knowledge. <but im
parting it. '"Thought transference" 1b what
1 mean â getting hold of others' minds. It is a
double-ended process. You must discover
where the truth risesâ scrutinize its genesis â
and also where it fails. Find the line of l*ast
resistance where knowledge may enter. The
teacher must have an imagination and must
be. busied -with It all the time. He must get
rid of his condition so he may enter into that
of his pupil's. He must be an altruist â to bÂ«
able to bear the burdens of his weakest pu
pil. His imagination should be artistically
trained, for this is his great business. It Is
to be able to appreciate, other minds than our
own. It is to reach the child's innocent point
of view.
A characteristic of the art product Is that
It never can be qclte complete. The essential
artistic tralu In a. teacher'* work are fourâ
aptitude for \icar1ou5ness. an already accu
mulated wealth of knowledge, power of en
nobling throurh life, readiness to be forgot
ten.
Professor George Herbert Palmer of
Harvard University had "Teaching as a
Fine Art" as the subject for the address
he delivered this afternoon in Hearst Hall
at the third of the university meetings
for summer school students. Teaching he
characterized as the best of the fine arts,
for it takes the crude, raw material and
molds it into something wonderfully great
and complexâ Into a man. The true art
ist takes h!s clay and shsrpes it into
forms of beautv, not for gain, but for
its own sake; not for selfisn or social re
sults, but to express' himself. This is the
kind of art and artist he would have In
the schools, the artist who enjoys what
he helps to create and delights in shap
ing the product under his control. In part
he said:

At the conclusion of the mass the miter
will be blessed and placed upon the head
of the consecrated Bishop, who will rise
and give his right hand to the consecra
tor. while the" first of the assistant Bish
ops will take him by tne left hand, and
thus he will be enthroned. -
Finally the consecrator will intone the
"Te Deum Laudamus," and some rubrics
will close the imposing ceremony.
At the conclusion of a prayer the chan
ter will begin the litanies, following which
the consecrator will take the book of the
gospels and place it on the forehead of
the elect, while the Bishops touch his
head with both hands. The consecrator
will follow the actions with the words,
"Receive the Holy Ghost." Then the con
secrator will read the "Propitiare," and
will subsequently intone the "Per Omnia
Saecula Saeculorum." Then will come the
recitation of the "Veni Creator Spiritus."
according to the custom of the .ordina
tion of priests.
The anointinsr of the hands will fol
low with the oration. "Sustentator." and
the consecrator will bless the elect with
holy water, and then for the first time
he will be given the pastoral staff.
The ring will then be produced and
blessed by the consecrator, who will place
it upon the third finger of the right hand
of the elect, at the same time giving into
his keeping the gospel.
ANOINTING HANDS.
The notary will then take the mandate
from the Bishop's hand and will read it in
slow and measured tone from beginning
to end. At the conclusion of the solemn
reading the consecrator will exclaim, "Deo
gratias."
After a preamble by the consecrator the
elect will rise and with head uncovered
and in answer to each question in regard
to Scripture,, tradition, morals and so on
will say, "Yes, with all my heart I desire
to assent to all things and obey In every
thing."
The senior Bishop will answer in the af
firmative and the consecrator will request
that it be read.
The elect with his face toward the con
secrator, the older Bishop to the right of
the elect, the Junior to his left, but in
such a manner that the two Bishops shall
face each other. Thus being placed, and
after a short interval, they will rise, the
elect without his berretta and the assistant
Bishops without their mitres. At this
moment the senior assistant Bishop, turn
ing toward the consecrator, will say:
"Most reverend father, the holy mother,
the Catholic church, asks that this present
presbyter you should raise to the burden
of the episcopacy," whereupon the- con
secrator will ask. "Have you the apostolic
mandate order?"
READING MANDATE.
There must be at least two Bishops in
attendance on the elect, each clothed In
the rochet and with the white mitre.
The church dignitaries who will attend on
this occasion will be'the Right Rev. Bish
op Grace of Sacramento and the Right
Rev. Bishop Conaty of Los" Angeles. At
the convenient hour, which has been set
at 8 o'clock in the morning, the elect,
with the Bishops, will enter the church and
the consecrator after prayer at the altar
will put on his vestments for the occa
sion, the elect, with the assistant Bishops,
retiring to their chapel in the meantime
also to clothe themselves in their vest
ments. When ready for the ceremony the
Bishops, with the elect In the center, will
enter and proceed before the consecrator
and bow low to him. They will then take
seats before him in the following order:
The forms attending the ceremony of
consecration are interesting, not only to
the clergy, but likewise to the layman.
There is around the whole ceremony a
profound atmosphere and marked solem
nity. There are regulations to be ob
served which are not jonly religious but
sternly official.
First of all, the consecrating Bishop
must know of the commission, either
from the Pope or otherwise, and the con
secration must be performed either on a
Sunday or on a feast of the Apostles, or
on any other festal day assigned by the
Pope. Saturday^.the day for tne conse
cration of Bishop-elect Libert, will be the
feast of St. James. .
ARCHBISHOP CONSECBATOR.
It is something like seventeen years ago
when Archbishop Riordan consecrated the
Bishop-elect's predecessor, the late Bish
op Gulstan Ropert, and his Grace per
formeTPa similar office when the present
Archbishop Montgomery wis appointed
Bishop of Los Angeles in 1894.
, Although many well-known priests of
San Francisco are away in Europe and
various parts of the country on summer
vacation there will be a large attendance
of clergy. As it is seldom that such an
important function as the consecration of
a Bishop has been performed in this city
a big congregation is expected to be pres
ent.
Preparations are being made for the
consecration of the Rev. \ Father Libert
Hubert Boeynaems, recently appointed
Bishop of Zeugma by the late Pontiff,
Leo XIII, at St. Mary's Cathedral on Sat
urday morning. A general invitation to
attend the ceremony has been Issued to
the clergy by his Grace Archbishop Rior
dan, who will be the consecrator.
Dr. C. F. Gladding, the autopsy physi
cian, who first believed, from the fact
that the skull 'was fractured, that the
man had been murdered, now says he has
come around to the suicide theory. He is
of the opinion that the fracture was
caused by the fall after the man shot
himself.
What makes me think it is Crandall all thÂ«
more strongly la that he was always talking
of investing his money in property around .the
bay and he, may have been in Berkeley for
that purpose. Besides that the Index finger
of his right hand was crooked on account. of a
felon he once had and the man In the Morgue
was afflicted In the same way... , -
This mysterious woman bore evidences
of having come a long way. She gave
her name to the officers on their promise
that her statement would not .be coupled'
with her name, arid ' that ""'her Identity'
would not be made public.;"
James Soufraine, a San Pablo-avenue
restaurant keeper, thought t6-day that
the man was one who had eaten a break
fast at his place last Friday, but he was
not sure of it. The man he had in mind
paid for the breakfast, which is another
proof that the man had money. and may
have been murdered for it.
The man was the former husband of Mrs.
Wallace Detro of Vina. Tehama County, from
whom he was divorced ten years ago. They
have a. child 10 years old and Mrs. Detro has
been keeping track of him on account of their
child. He had a- son 25 years old by a former
marriage. - ...
I am sure it is Crandall. He looks as he
did when I saw him last and I fear he was
murdered.
The Berkeley Morgue was visited by a
number of people to-day who thought
they might Identify the man who was
found dead at the Brennan barn last
Friday. â¢ Of this succession of would-be
identifiers but one, a woman, was rea
sonably eure that the man on the slab
was the man she expected to see.
A mysterious woman, who refused to
give her name, came to the Morgue to
night and said she thought the man was
Cranston Bertram Crandall. though shf>
could not say positively it was he, as she.
had not seen him for six years. She said:

j . Following is the detailed description of
the lines of railroad which, the Mayor
says, should be assessed in part by the
city of Oakland and in part by the
county: ' Â¦
* The railroad known as tb*- Seventh-street
Local, consisting of two main tracks and com
mencing at the western end of the Oakland
Mole. 4a Alameda County, and running thence,

ewltchen, and commencing at Ships Channel,
In the Bay of San Francisco, j and running
thence eastwardly along the narrow gauga
mole to the highland In^Alameda City, thence
eastwardly along the southern shore line of
Oakland Harbor to a point directly opposite the
foot of Harrison street in the city of Oakland,
thence northerly crossing said Oakland Harbor,
thence curving" northwesterly across First

The railroad operated exclusively in Alameda
County.- known as the Berkeley branch road,
consisting of two main tracks and commencing
at a point near the Berryman tract in the

tion as having been one-main track and no ,
mileage within. the limits of the city of Oak-,
land south of the town of Emeryville.
All these railroads are operated wholly within
the County of Alam*da and therefore should,
under, the constitution and laws, be assessed
for purposes of taxation by the local assessors.
Th? city of Oakland respectfully and earnest
ly protests against any, further assessments of

left swings to the body, but was content
to let Corbett do the worrying. -For five
rounds the bout was slow, Corbett simply
stabbing with his left, trying to get near
enough to reach over with his right; but
he never got a chance, as Briggs was
ready to back away or duck under the
powerful blows. The champion was
faulty In measuring hia distance., as many
of the swings upon which he depended
fell short or his wildness carried him Into
the ropes.
The seventh was the most vicious
round, as Corbett at this point mixed the
fight and endeavored to finish it. Briggs.
by avoiding Corbett's rushes and keeping
his head, stood the gaff well. The re
mainder of the bout lacked interest, as
Corbett needed steam and Briggs was
playing a waiting game.
BOSTON", July 22.â While Yotrny Cor
bett, champion feather-weight of the
world, got the decision over Jimmy
Briggs In their ten-round bout to-night
before the Tammany Club, the Boston
boy gained considerable prestige by stay
ing the limit. It was the second time the
two had met, and each time Briggs man
aged to stay with the champion the full
length of the bout. An agreement to
break clean was costly to Corbett, who
does his greatest execution when fastened
to his opponent.
Briggs exercised excellent ring general
ship and kept away from Corbett's
swings or ducked when he- was in close.
As a consequence Corbett failed to land
any damaging blows and Brigs* was
fresh at the finish.
The railroad people write they will pur
chase or will exchange for another piece
"better situated for the interests of both
rarties."'
Mayor Olney has referred the matter to
City Engineer Turner for a report.

~~ "SUMMER FOOD"~
Has Other Advantages.
Mary people have tried the food Grape-
Nuts simply with the idea of avoiding
the trouble of cooking food In the hot
months.
All cf these have found something be-
eidrs the ready cooked food idea, for
Grape-Nute is a scientific food that tones
up end restores a sick stomach, as w*ll
as reoairs the waste tissue In brain and
nerve centers.
"Fcr two years I had been a sufferer
from catarrh of the stomach due to Im-
proper food, Â«nd to relieve this condition
I had tried nearly every prepared food
on the market without any success, until
cix months ago my wife purchased a. box
of Grape-Nutn. thinking it x would be a
desirable cereal for the summer months.
"We soon made a discovery; we were
rnchanted with the delightful flavor of
the foe/J, and to my surprise I began to
pet well. My breakfast now consists of
st. little fruit, four tcaspoonfuls of Grape-
Nuts, a cup of Postum, which I â¢ prefer
to coffee; graham bread or toast, and two
bo'led eggs. I never suffer the least dis-
tress after eating this and my stomach
is perfect and genere.1 health fine. Grape-
Nuts is a wonderful preparation. It was
only a little time after starting on it that
wife and I both felt younger, more vig-
orous and in all ways stronger. This has
been our experience.
"P. S.â The addition of a little salt in
place of fucar seems to me to improve
the food." Name given by Postum Co.,

Ceased During
Fainting Spells.
Revived by Artificial
Respiration.
Dr. Miles' Heart Cure
Cured Wife.
Faintis; spells are- Â» sure indication of a
weak heart. The heart cannot do the work
required of it and stops beating. If it ceases
for more than a minute death ensues. Weak
hearts must have aid from the outside, sttch
as Dr. Miles' Heart Cere - alone can give. It
is a heart tonic It regulates the pulse, en-
riches the blood and improves the circulation.
â¢ "For two years my wife was in very poor
health, s . At first her back troubled her *
great deal, then she had shortness of breath
and irregularity of the periods. The pain
in her back grew worse and extended to ths
connection of tne spinal cord at the base of
the brain and from there to her heart. She
had two very bad sinking spells, when the
pain in her heart was most intense and her
breath stopped. The second time we had to
resort to artificial respiration to revive her.
We were advised to give Dr. Miles' Heart
Care a trial and 1 bought a bottle and began
giving it as directed. We found the doses
were too- strong, so I gave her half dose j
three times a day, and she began to improve.
After she had taken two bottles the pains
were all gone and she was feeling like a new
woman. She continued the Heart Core in
small doses for several months and is now
enjoying -better health than for the past six
years."â M. J. Thompson, Dept County
Clerk, Klamath P. O, C*L

Pacific Mail Company's steam
1 ship Newport arrived yesterday
II from Panama and way ports. She
** brought the usual cargo and a
score of passengers, of whom five
were Chinese. A. M. Garland, the Pacific
Mall Company's special coast agent, came
up from Guatemala on the liner. He re
ports conditions quiet all along the coast.
He says the coffee crop has been all gath
ered and that it proved plentiful, as had
been expected. In Guatemala the crop
was unusually good, and but for the de
struction wrought by Santa Maria would
have exceeded all previous record?. The
loss of coffee directly caused by the visi
tation of lava and ashes is estimated,
eays Agent Garland, at about 20,000 tons.
Under the circumstances Guatemala came
out very well, and had it not been that
the military service absorbed much of the
republic's labor material the shortage
caused by the volcano would hardly have
been noticed.
NEWPORT. R. I.. July 22.â The last
run cf the New York Yacht Club on the
cruise back from Vineyard Haven to-day
was not as disappointing as that of yes
terday*, at least so far as the SO-footers
were concerned. Within a mile of the
start the Reliance and Columbia struck
bottom on the eastern end of the middle
ground in Vineyard Sound, and only the
quick turn of the wheel saved the Con
stitution. The Reliance came off within
two minutes, while the Columbia, held
on the shoal by a strong tide, struck
there for over an hour, being finally as
sisted cff apparently uninjured, but of
course out of the race. The other two
boats kept on. but on getting out be
yond Gavhead a strong puff of wind
snapped off the topmast of the Consti
tution. After the wreck had been cleared
away she proceeded and crossed the fin
ish line nearly three-quarters of an hour
after the Reliance, eo that the latter boat
had practically a walkover. The cruise
ends with two wins to the credit of both
the Reliance and the Constitution.
A drver examined the fin of the Re
liance after her arrival in port, but could
discover no damage, so that probably
Ehe will be in the race to-morrow. The
Constitution procured a new topmast this
afternoon and will also start. The Co
lumbia arrived in port half an hourafter
the Constitution, apparently uninjured.
The event to-morrcw is the annual race
for the Astor cup, but as neither of the
tup yachts has been measured under the
new rules they will not compete for the
trophy given by Colonel John Jacob As
tor, but will sail for a special cup.
Quick Turn cf Wheel Saves Constitu
tion From Shoal.
RELIANCE GOES AGROUND.
Half an hour after the start, when they
tacked, the , challenger led by an eighth
cf a mile. Three-quarters of an hour
later the wind suddenly shifted and the
â¢ Id boat, belns to windward but astern,
gained a minute by It.
The wind freshened to nearly fifteen
knors, with a short sea running, and the
boats fairly flew to the turn. With spin
nakers set. they started for the finish at
thirteen knots an hour, but had run only
half an hour when the fog enveloped them
and the race was cff.
The yacht has a spare gaff at the Erie
B&sin and it will be in place in time for
to-morrow's race. A dense fog shut down
on the racing yachts when they had sailed
about five miles of the last leg of the
course, putting an end to the racing. For
an hour afterward they sailed for the
lightship,, each hidden from view of the
â¢ ither and both out of sight" from the
L'rin. They had reduced sail, but it was
dangerous running, the precious challeng
er in the pathway of the trans-Atlantic
liners. The creat Majestic passed the
lightship and disappeared in the direction
from which the tShamtock HI was coming
long before the challenger reached the
lightship, but passed her without mishap.
Shamrock III had been heading the older
boat by five minutes when the fog shut
down, so that when Shamrock I was the
first to appear at Sandy Hook lightship,
where the Erin waited, the anxiety on
the Erin was increased. The Erin's whis
tle joined with that of the lightship as a
guide to the missing boat and ten min
utes after the old boat appeared, sailing
under her jib only, and was taken in
tow of the Erin. Shamrock III had beat
en the old beat 3 minutes 45 seconds to
the turn and was fi%*e minutes ahead
when the fog rolled in. The course was
a beat to windwaid. fifteen miles south
southeast, from Sandy Hook lightship,
and a FDinnaker run back.
ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS. N. J.. July
2*J.â Sir Thomas Liptoa watched anxious
ly from the deck of the Erin to-day
while for an hour his -priceless cup chal
lenger was temporarily lost to his vision
behind a wail of fog. When the beauti
ful yacht tame limping out of the fog
with her caff breken Sir Thomas was so
pleased to see her safe that the accident
was of little importance to him. The
steel saff *'*s bent and the rivets pulled
out about ten feet from the mast, as the
yacht jumped into a sharp tumble of
eea. It did not break entirely in two.

Hart North Suggests
Way of Doing It
Effectually. \
Says No Writs of Habeas
Corpus Should Issue With
out Examination.
United States Immigrant â¢ Commissioner
Hart North makes the following state
ment with reference . to the proposed de
nial of the writ of habeas corpus to Chi
nese immigrants In certain cases: .
It is reported to me that the United States
Attorney is in receipt of a letter, from the
Commissioner General or Immigration request
ing that writs of habeas corpus be not Issued
on behalf of Chinese persons arriving at this
port and claiming to be native born until their
landing has been denied by this office.
In -this class of cases it has been customary
for the courts to issue writs regardless of the
question as to whether or not the examinations
conducted by the Inspectors employed in the
tnforccment of the exclusion acts have been
completed, and in some cases even begun, anfl
such practice has often resulted in both unnec
essary work and humiliation for this office.
It is my opinion that if the- courts would re
quire evidence of a denial by the immigration
officers as a prerequisite to Issuing the writ
more satisfactory results would ensue, as this
would make it possible to secure the evidence
not only of the applicant but also of his
witnesses before an opportunity was given them
to make their stories tally, this having been
proved to be the inevitable result of the appli
cants being taken from our custody by writ.
Such a step would not be a suspension of the
writ of habeas corpus within the meaning of
the constitution, but would merely require the
applicant to show himself entitled to- the writ
in advance, and such a requirement is placed
by the statutes in the discretion of the court.
If. on the other hand, the courts In their
wisdom desire to handle all cases of alleged
native born Chinese without regard to an ex
amination under the Immigration and Chinese
exclusion laws, no doubt the proper instructions
could issue to that end, thus relieving us from
all examination of such Chinese.
BRITISH VICE CONSUL :
TAKES HAND IN GAME
Swears Out Warrant for T. J. New
man's Arrest for Disturb
ing the Peace.
Wellesley Moore, the British Vice Con
sul, secured a warrant from Police Judge
Cabaniss yesterday for the arrest of T.
J. Newman, proprietor of a sailors' board
ing-house at 76 Jackson street, on a charge
of disturbing the peace. He said New
man had been making himself offensive
at the consulate for some time,' and had
become a nuisance. He went to the con
sulate yesterday morning and raised the
final disturbance.
Newman was arrested last Monday on
a charge of battery .upon Arthur Cham
bers, a clerk at the consulate because he
was ordered out while some British sail
ors were being paid. The case came up
before Judge Cabanlss on Tuesday and
was continued till to-morrow. Yesterday
morning Newman abused the officials at,
the consulate for having him arrested and
made statements which the Vice Consul
says are absurd and without the slight
est foundation.
Unable to Hold Zimmerman.
The police have been unable to connect
Fred Zimmerman with the attempt to rob
Mrs. Jennie Hughes at 314 Gough street
about two weeks ago. After being shown
to the different watches on Tuesday and
yesterday he was booked at the City Pris
on on a charge of carrying burglar's* tools,
which were found in his possession when
arrested several days ago. , . ;

Receipts of new Potatoes were light and as
offerings were generally of good quality the
market cleaned up quickly at firmer prices.
Sales of fancy flock were reported above the
quotations, eoine desirable lots in boxes sell
ing up to $1 HO per cental. Ths low prices
that prevailed during the past few days have
had the effect of checking the movement ct
cheap and green stock from the river districts.
Old potatoes â¢ were unchanged, with trade of
small volume. Receipts of Onions were com
paratively light, but the market eontinueJ
weak with stocks steadily accumulating.
Trading In vegetables was brisk, but as
receipts were large, prices of most kinds ten
ed downward. Fancy Green Corn was steady
at. full figures, but poor and wormy stock
was in abundant cupply and neglected, hence
the wide range in prices. Green Peppers, Okra
and Egg Plant arrived freely and prices were
shaded. The demand, however, was steady.
Cucumbers in small boxes were practically
unsalable, owing to the abundance and low
prices of large boxes from around the bay.
Lima Beans and Summer Squash were slight
ly firmer. String and Wax Beans were in
free supply and dull except for strictly fancy
offerings. Tomatoes were in heavy receipt and
there was a sharp drop In prices.

fAHTIAI, EXPLANATION OF THE RECENT
MYSTERIOUS DECLINE.
TJse ICew Tork dnruJar of Henry Clews, on-
Cer fiate July 16. saye: "Another weak of heavy
end mysterious liquidation has taken place.
Further leases were ft course Incurred, and
ruTnere of embarrassment were more or les*
current, which invest lration proved to have
little foundation, for the reason that Injuries
have fallen upon the strong rather than upon
tije m-eek. There was not much in the way of
new explanations for the decline. The old
reactionary forces, though still at work, seem
ed to havÂ» tfajporarily exhausted themselves.
UT.tll tne bear contingent, encouraged hy past
success discovered fresh point* of weakness
that yielded to attack. As a result of the Ut
ter operations prices ajraln touched the !owe*t
roir.t in the present movement, end good rup-
P'-Tt was entirely lacking at time*, except
vhen symrtotne seemed panicky. Whenever
panic, however, â¢eemed Imminent it was ob
tei-x'ed th* decline was stopried, and In high
financial cl-cleÂ« the absence of concern at the
market's r>TÂ«tions was very noticeable. An
other *!r.gular feature was that tbe decline*
were Just as severe In h1ph-c!ass pecurltie* a*
in thoee of Indifferent character, and the sell
ing of these could not always be attributed to
l:qulÂ£arion cf weak accounts or to short ealee.
To be brlÂ«-f. a new element was discovered in
fluencing the market, and that was the money
situation.
"IistsfiiH quantities of railroad paper are
In the. market, the Mg railroad* being borrow
ers In th!Â» form to an altogether unprecedented
degree. Pennsylvania'* heavy borrowings will
roon ceaee to be a factor in the money market,
that corporation havlrg been more successful
thar. other* in changing its loans into fixed cap
ital, but Lake Ehore. New York Central. Hock
lr.K Valley. Burllngtcn end finally Union Pa
cific have all been, or will be. heavy borrowers
within a ehort period of time. To what extent
ether roÂ«As are lncreastne tbeir floating debt
is cot known, but it ts considerable. These
*un<Is are. usually, imperatively needed for lm-
Vrovemer.u to meet the urgent demands of
(rrowir.g traffic. As a rule these proposed ex
penditures are necessary and Justifiable: they
ere the natural demands cf growth. But in
the rre*ent congested state of the security
rr.arket It is impossible to market any such
eraourts cf new stocks and bonds as would
cover these outlays except at unnecessary *ae
rlSces. It is better f.nar.ring to borrow money
for such Improvements rn nctes, even at 6 per
cer.t. for one or two year*, and issue bends or
rtocks at a later and more convenient opportu
r.lty. If issued now. sucrh securities would
either have to be offered below par or pay
more rearly the ordinarj' rate of Interest.
"It Is quite evlrtent that far-eighted finan
cier* anticipate good rates for money for some
time to come. A year a^o gwl stocks were
relling en a 4 per cer.t basie and bonds on a
Â£63% barls. .Mor.ey at 6 per cfÂ»r.t means a
very' contlderable fall in such recuritles. and
this haÂ« been more of a factcr In the last
decline than is generally recognized. Wealthy
Inrtttutloni' have sold considerable of their (rtlt
eÂ«gÂ» rtock* In order to tÂ»ke the new offerings
cf railroad paper, which are an even Â«afer In.
Â¦*-e*trnect and yield better returns. â¢ Eorne of
thi* selling was. of course, supposed to 'be
further forced liquidation, and it wÂ»e this
Â¦untferrtandlnB: of the rnovement that explained
the comparative ahsenre of <3irtru*t In bank
'ng circles. Indication* are that the worst of
the decline is over, and the market eeems fully
?ntltled to a fair raily, but it Is net T**t clear
that the readjustment is complete. Some weak
ppot* remain, and the higher rates for monev
feera likely to put a further restraint upon
rpe<rulatlve end unsound enterprises. Briefly
vtatei*, Wall street hac used up all its available
capital Jn promoting and underwriting schemes.
and now that the legitimate demand* of busi
ness and Ir.durtry apsert themselves, the market
If obliged to wrlÂ«rle out of ltÂ» predicament In
the best fashion that it can. Our troubles thu*
far ere strictly financial. Whether they are
Â«>nfled. end whether they will extend to general
business cr not. It is altogether too premature
to say.
"A favorable feature of much significance if
the foreign buying of our eecuritiee, as well
tF the disposition of Europe to renew our cred
its abroad after the prompt payments made last
rrirlng. It is probafcle that nonrtderable of the
rallmafl borrowing* referred to above will be
jlaced abroad, and these two influences have
c!rea<5y lnCuced a heavy break In sterling,
which put* en end to all roid exports for the
r>r*wnt- Evidently we eha!l be obliged to look
to Europe for relief in case of monetary strtn
crency. and fortunately it Eeercs likely to be
available. As eald above, the worÂ»t of the de
cline' seems to be over, and the best ctockr
ehould be a purchase on the scale downward. "â¢

CHICAGO. July 22.â The effect of yester
day's bullish Government crop report stimu
lated the opening In wheat and caused some
early strength. September was a shade lower
to a shade higher at 76%@70?4c and sold up
quickly to 7C%c. . Gn the advance, howtver,
the pit traders sold freely and support was
lacking. The result was an easing off ni
prices, which was furthered later In the session
by the unloading of long lines and by. selling
orders from fit. Louis. September went down
to 759ic where commission houses checked the
decline and carried the price back'%i3%,c.
the closing figures being 75%@75%c.
There was a good country ana oommirslnn
houÂ«e demand for corn early on increasing re
port s cf uneven crop and the market' showed
strength. September closed steady with a losj
of %c at 49%c. after ranging . between 40%c
and 50%c.
Trade In oats was largely local and prices
were somewhat better. A continued support
by local bulls on unfavorable crop advices
saved the market from a severe break and the
close wu at a gain of %c for September at
32^<&32%e. with a range for the day from
32%c to 33%e.
Provisions were strong, due to fair local
buying and an absence of outside liquidation,
together with a better feeling In hogs. Trad-
Ing was rather quiet and featureless. Septem
ber pork closed unchanged, lard 10&12%c
higher and ribs up a shade. ,.

-EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July 22.â ThÂ« price lev#l of
securities made ecme recovery to-day In a:i
irregular market. ThÂ« opening rise met re
newed selling, especially in the United Stare"
Steel stocks, which caused a wavering In the
whole list. With a relaxation of the urgent
pressure upon these stocks the market took on
a better tone and started more steadily up
ward. There were occasional slight reactions,
but the trading fell away to nominal propor
tions at the recessions until the last hour of
the session. At the time the market paused
for a time and then turned downward on a
growing x-olume of selling and closed easy.
The principal active stocks had bten lifted
from 2 to 3 points over last night's close an.l
the reaction left them not more than' half
of the extreme gain?. The upward movement
of rrices was accompanied fcy as little news
as the recent eevere declines but the pres
surt. to sell was not felt, and a partial re
bound was normal. The demand from the
ehorts ww an important element in. the buy
* Â«". n as a matter of course, after so violent a
decline as that which has been occurring. No
other .inducement to cover shorts was needed
than the failure to dislodge stocks with the
recent curtotnarv ease. The alarming rumor.*
of financial difficulties which were numerous
yerterday all failed of corroboration to-day and
this f jrmÂ«d a negative influence on the buy inn
eide of the market. Some of the commlnlon
houses profetu. to have some buying orders of
an investment character. Theee were not In
large amounts and they did not follow the
market far on any advances.. The rise in the
<Jlvldend rat* on Erie first preferred from a 3
to a 4 p*r cent basis hade Itself felt to sonv
extent In the market. Many past hop<s of divi
<Jend increases, raised by the large surplus
earnings rer>orted by various railroad compa
nies, have been held in abeyance Â«lnce the
period of putting surplus earnings back Into
Improvements, and sometimes in addition issu
ing bonds fir additional improvement funds.
Some of the high prices of last year In stocks
were based upon probable dividend tncreanes,
which were confidently counted upon and com
paratively few of which were realized. The
Erie Increase â¢Â« the first Incident to revive any
hope that some of these expectations may b<Â«
realized later. In epite o f the prevalent com
petition for ready funds among railroad cor
porations. The early strength In the grain
mtrket was logically against stocks but It
was Ignored, and the late reaction in grain fail
ed equally to ho!4 stocks at the top level
There was a notable falling off in the num
ber of inactive stocks to show wide declines
on the marketing of small blocks. Colorado
Fuel preferred was the only notable example
100 shares of that stock selling 2 points lower
than the last preceding sale.
The active bond Issue* were firmer but the
market was Irregular. Total sales, par value
$2,175,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.

LIVERPOOL.
Local dealers report & very fine interior and
city demand for Hay, and says that the con
sumers are making the market more than
for years back. They say that the present
firmness is not at all due to speculation, but
to a genuine demand for the goods. The feel
ing is firm at the advance already noted. The
circular of Somers A Co. says: -
'"Hay continues to come in quite freely, the
total for -the week Just ended amounting to
3600 tons, one-quarter of which arrived by
water. Although cars are a bit more plenti
ful, still we are not yet getting the Hay that
is awaiting transportation at the principal
shipping centers.
" The market Is In rather a disturbed con
dition, for buyers and pellers are considerably
apart in their ideas of values. It Is generally
conceded that the State has a fair crop, but
the outside demand is so heavy that gradually
quite a portion of the crop In the country ts
being bought up for shipment elsewhere. This
has stimulated the buying on the part of the
San Francisco dealers and many of them In
their eagerness have paid considerably above
the present market here. Just how they will
come out on thia remains to be seen, although
we* Incline to the opinion that as many sec
tions of country close at hand will be In the
market for hay throughout the season, this
alone, will tend to keep prices up to a high
range throughout the year. Some look for
lower prices before the rains, while others
prophecy very high figures during the Winter.
One thing we do know, and that le that quits
a bit of the crop is being bought. up at high
prices, and to enable the purchasers to come
out the market must rule at considerably above
the present price list.

above present quotations, but matters are
irather quiet with most kinds."

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ The foreign markets were dull
with lower futures. .
Chicago was lower again, in spite of the
bullish cast of the Weekly Government re
port, which showed disappointing returns from
the threshing of Winter Wheat and an im
paired condition of the Spring Wheat crop.
IlradRtreet'n report showed a decrease of 2 â¢
200.000 bushels In the world's visible supply
Futures in this market were weaker. The
marked' rise of Monday and Tuesday is ascrib
ed to short stocks in the State,' the existence
of many buyers and but few sellers In the
local market, and vague rumors that Japan
may enter this market as a buyer. Australia
is not figured on much now, as it said
that Argentina can supply her wants $.1 t>er

August A- meeting of representatives' of the
various lines operating [Â£Â«Â» PuÂ«t Sound . and
Portland was held iiv Seattle _\Y ednesday, at
which an agreement to this waB made.
The rate on wheat remains at $5 per ton. The
13 flour rate was originally put into effect
1 for the- month of June to meet the rate mads
by the China Commercial Company, a . new
concern operating ' out of San Francisco. . The
cut was 'then extended' through July, and la
now continued: through Auguat. : Oriental buy
ers are said, to have hardly anticipated a con
tinuance of the cut rate, having made heavy
purchases of : flour, expecting: the old rate to
Receipts of most descriptions of deciduous
fruits were ample, but supplies of choice ripe
stock were comparatively light and prices for
such offerlnes were well maintained. There
was a fair demand for choice Plums, Prunes
Peaches and fancy Gravcnstein Apples for ship
ment on the Portland steamer, and these fruits
were quite steady in consequence. Receipts of
fruit in baskets from the river sections con
tinued light and prices were well sustained.
Bartlett Pears and Plums from those Bectlona
arrived freely and choice offering! moved off
well. The canners were in the market for
both descriptions and bought freely of. the best
offerings at the prices quoted below. Apricots
in small packages were steady, but bulk stock
was easy. The canners were Indifferent buy
ers and would not pay more than $25 per ton
except for Rllt-edged stock. As high as *55
Â«ag obtained from the regular trade in a ped.
dllne way. Gravenstein Apples in 4-tler boxes
were In demand at $1 25@1 35 per box, but
cheaper grades were dull. Figs were scarce
Â»nd firmer. Shipments from Stockton have
about ceased. Fancy Seedless Grapes moved
off well, but the other varieties were generally
'sour and moved slowly. Watermelons are not
coming In as freely as heretofore and the mar
ket is gradually cleaning up. Other Melons
stand about .the same, with supplies plentiful.
Attractive lots of Berries cleaned up quickly
and prices of Strawberries and Loganberries
ranged higher. Receipts of the latter were
very light. Currants were in limited supply
and sold by the drawer at firmer rates.
Citrus and Tropical fruits stood about as pre
viously quoted. Two carloads of Central Amer
ican Bananas came in and there were liberal
recelnta of the Hawaiian article.
STRAWBERRIES â $5@7 per chest for Long

Butter continues unsettled, some houses be
ing weak and others steady. Stocks are ample
for all immediate needs and the market Is
quiet.
Cheese is quoted quiet at the quotation- be
low, with enough on hand to keep buyers well
supplied.
The advance in Egga to 27c was rather hasty,
but dealers are not disposed to shade the mar
ket, though trade Is dull. Stocks are ample

WBIT IS ISSUED, j
A writ of subpena In ; conformity with
the prayer of the bill was issued. and the
defendants were ordered to appear in
court on the first Monday in September.
A gentleman who is conversant with the
history of the case said that the litigation
In the matter of the United States Ship
building Company began several weeks
ago, when a minority of the stockholders
complained that the Bethlehem works
were greatly overcapitalized, that no pro
vision had been made for the payment of
the bonds, that the money of, the ship
building company had been expended in
the purchase . of plants and that there
were no reserve funds for-ihe purpose of
carrying on the. business. They brought
an action before United States Judge
Kirkpatrlck In New Jersey to have a re
ceiver appointed to marshal the assets
and â¢ to Btralghten up^ the affairs of the
company. '*'.V :
The distinction between that case and
It is also set forth that on. July 1,1903,
the semi-annual installment of interest
amounting to $400,000 became due and that
payment of the same was refused by the
United States Shipbuilding Company;
that the annual installment of $200,000 to
be applied to the redemption of the bonds
became due on July 1. 1903. and was re
fused payment by said defendant. Then
the bill goes on. to .say .that on June 30,
lÂ«03. the United States Circuit Court for
the district of New Jersey, in a suit
wherein Roland R. Conklln and others
were plaintiffs and the United States Ship
building Company was defendant, ap
pointed James Smith Jr. as receiver, "by
reason of which appointment of a re
ceiver the right of the Mercantile Trust
Company to proceed with the foreclosure
of the deed of trust has become absolute
without waiting for a continuance of the
period of default."
It Is then alleged that the. United. States
Shipbuilding Company has become In
solvent and unable to pay its obligations.
It is stated further that on August 11.
190** the company defendant leased to the
Union Iron Works all its property in Cal
ifornia. .
The complainant prays that the mort
gage or deed of trust may be decreed to
be a Hen upon all the property men
tioned; that the United States Shipbuild
ing Company and Receiver Smith be de
creed to pay to the. petitioner whatever
sums may be due upon the bonds, with
all costs and expenses, and In default
may be barred and, foreclosed from, all
equity of redemption or claim of any of
the property; that the__property may be
sold under a decree of the court, and that
the master appointed to make the sale
may be directed to execute a deed of con
veyance; that the United States Shipbuild
ing Company, the Union Iron Works and
Receiver Smith may be commanded at the
option of the purchaser either to Join in
a <leed or to execute a deed of conveyance
to such purchaser covering the property
described in the deed, of trust; that a tem
porary order be made restraining the de
fendants and all other persons during the
pendency of the^case from selling, trans
ferring or disposing of any of the prop
erty; that subpena be issued commanding

Whitelaw Flcrunders at
Mercy of Pitiless
Inquisitor.
Bernard D. "Whitelaw had a bad hour
of It on the witness stand in Judge Cook's
court yesterday afternoon, when he was
given an opportunity to try to clear him
self of the charge of being one of the
three thugs who assaulted Mrs. Mathewa
and robbed the house at 543 Halght street
on the afternoon Of March 4. His expla
nations, given glibly enough on the direct
examination by . his attorney, W. S.
Barnes, were so thoroughly punctured by
the searching cross-examination of Dis
trict Attorney L. E. Byington that the
accused thief stood practically condemned
by hls'own'words.
By the severe grilling to which he ttos
put,- by the- prosecuting attorney it was
developed; that persons whom Whitelaw
claim to be able to clear him from the
charge " for which he is being tried have
cither' slipped his memory altogether or
have: not been subpenaed on account of
absence from the State. Upon being cor
nered, the accused was forced to admit
that two individuals -who misrht assist
him in establishing an alibi are now in
the City Prison, one under the charge of
murder.
Whitelaw took the stand in his own be
half with a. confident air and rattled off
an easy tale, which was to prove that at
the hour when the cowardly assault was
made upon Mrs. Mathews he was two
miles from the scene of the crimeâ at
Third and Townsend streets station in
fact, on urgent business for his father.
On Murch 2, the day upon which the po
lice say he visited the home of Mrs. Tut
le and her mother. Mrs. Mathews, Whlte
aw sciifht to prove that he was busy es
ortins his mother and sister to the San
Â¦a Te train at Point Richmond. He de
ilared that he did not return to the city
intll* afier' 12:30 o'clock, the hour when
he is alleged to have helped rob Mrs.
ruttle; ljut Mrs, Mabel Kearney of 1203
gutter street, who accompanied "White
law end his people to Point Richmond,
sai'J under oath that they returned at 11
o'clock.
. On the day on which the assault took
place Whitelaw told a story which was
torn to â¢ shreds ' by the cross-examination
of Attorney Byington. He said . that in
the morning , he went to the room of a
party" to get a suit of clothes
for another "certain party," who lived
on O'Farrell.' street, between Hyde and
Mason. Under the whips of Byington's
searching cross-examination the squirm
ing witness was forced to disclose the
fact that the "certain party" for whom
he procured the clothes was Ned Lupton,
alias Milton, now awaiting trial for the
murder ; of 'James Gilleece, the aged sa
loon-keeper, on April 14, and that the
other "certain party," whose name he had
forgotten.' was also in the City Prison at
the present time. y> 'â¢:
At .., the .hour upon which the assault
took> place Whitelaw was. according to
his own statements, trying to find a myth
leal James Hesslewood at the Third and
Townsend streets depot. He claimed that
three reliable witnesses could testify to
the: fact that he was talking to them
there. To refute this Attorney Byington
produced the affidavit which Whitelaw
had sworn to â¢ in his efforts to have " his
trial . postponed until July 20. This affi
davit stated that the witnesses were then
outof the State, but would be In the city
to testify by that date. Upon being pressed
Whitelaw admitted -that he never saw
the men to warrant his statements in
the affidavit and did not even know their
names. - Thus Whitelaw's mainstay was
knocked from beneath -his feet
Ruby Grills retold her story as related
in J the testimony of the Docia Nolan
trial.. H. H.; Johnson, the real estate
dealer; Detectives Wrerr and Dinan Po
lice ': Officer O'Connell. Theodore Kytka,
