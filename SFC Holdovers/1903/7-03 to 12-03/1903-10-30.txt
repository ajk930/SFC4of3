Fenelon, Nev., this morning at 7 o'clock.
The Limited was running behind time
and a work train took the main track
and tried to make a siding a few miles
from Fenelon before the Limited was
due, but the passenger train had gained
some of her lest . time and crashed mto
the work train going at a high rate of
speed. Both engines were derailed and
badly wrecked. The passenger coaches
all stayed en the track. A few passen
gers were slightly cut and bruised by be-,
ing thrown from their berths.
The work train was light, pulling but a
few empty cars, and Is s. total wreck.
There were about forty men on board *he
work train, and three whose names have
not yet been learned were killed. Four
were seriously Injured and will probably
die, as they have "not yet regained con
sciousness. The; baggage and * express
cars of the Limited were telescoped and
had not the messengers and postal clerk3
jumped they would have been killed. The>
cars were so badly smashed that 'they
will have to be loaded on flat cars for re

day. and got the track cleared at a late
hour to-night.

FRANCE TO TAKE A HAND.
Eastern Mover- ?nts.
PARIS, Oct. 30.â The dinner given at the
ElyBee Palace last night in honor of Count
Lamsdorff was an exclusive affair, the
guests being a few high French officials
and the Russian diplomatists.
The Figaro this morning says it has
reasons to believe that one of the results
of Count LamsdorfTs visit will be that
France will exercise an influence In the
Korean situation along paraiiel lines with
that of Russia and for the interests of
peace.
According to the Echo de Parts, Count
Lamsdorff has practically declared that
It is desirable to cast the entire weight
and influence of the Franco-Russian alli
ance upon the enterprising spirit of Vice
roy Alexieff, whose warlike Intentions the
Russian Chancellor fears more than the
preparations of Japan. This paper also
says that there are reasons to believe that
the Japanese Minister has made overtures
in view of the fact that Count Lamsdorff
and M. Delcasse are considering the
question of submitting the Korean differ
ences to arbitration.
Count Casslni. the Russian Embassador
to the United States, who is now in Paris,
was not surprised to hear that the Rus
sian trcops had re-entered Mukden, in
â¢view of the conditions there. He said
that the experience of the Russian au
thorities was that as soon as they sur
rendered a district to the Chinese the lat
ter are unable to preserve order; disturb
ances occur and foreign interests are men
aced. The Embasrador added that the re
turn of the Russian troops did not affect
the status of Mukden as an open port in
accordance with the treaty between the
United States and China.

The rest of the report was Â¦', the same
story as has already been told. ' Chief
Officer C. C. Bruce's^statcment was prac-"
tically the same as the captain's.
Second Officer Arthur Raven's report
said that he was on watch at 8:3&'o' clock
the night preceding the .wreck, 'when] the
captain' asked him ' where he * thought : h*
"There were five feet of crater in the
hold. I ordered the boats lowered and
put ten passengers, two saiiors. t*e
steward, cook, two firemen, two sailors,
one waiter and a stowaway in the port
boat. The starboard boat was capable
of carrying the' rest of the crew. Hie
chief. officer and myself wero satisfied
that the two* boats would carry all of the
people aboard." - *
At the opening of the investigation the
reports of the captain and the first and
second officers were read. Captain Mc-
Intyre's story was as follows:- "We took
a cast at 4 o'clock, getting seventy-five
fathoms. I then ordered her hauled .south
by east, half east. We struck at 4:10 a.
m. I immediately came on deck and or
dered the mate to put the wheel hard
sport and stop -her. He replied that he
had already done so. I then started her
slowly to keep her head to sea.
ABANDONS THE SHIP.
During a vigorous questioning by Cap
tain j Bolles the master of the South
Portland admitted that he had never
had any regular lifeboat drill; that the
members of the crew had no knowledge
of the positions they were to occupy in
case of sudden disaster: that although
he knew that the ship was. doomed, he
left the deck and Instead of attending to
the lowering of the lifeboats, went to the
engine-room twice to see whether or. not
the ship was making water. The master
further admitted that although .ho occa
sionally had a station drill, the seamen
were not numbered or designated to any
particular station, but had to depend on
the officers^ to know where to go. Witness
also made the admission Chat tha boats
were not fastened to the ship by. their
painters at the time of their launching,
and that he left the shia before ill the
people aboard had gone. *jV
'Two or the passengers gave t-s:lm(>::y
that they saw but little of thecaptnin;
one of them, although he was on the deck
all the time, saw the master bui o-ice.
Both agreed ; that there were not. many
life preservers available for the use of
the passengers, and one of them "said
he saw no provisions put into one of the
boats. Also they stated that the captain
left the ship in one of the lifeboats and
allowed the iest of the crew to look after
themselves. . :

to the boats?"
'"I had a two, three, four or five minute

".When did you have station drills?"
"I never had any regular station or fire
drill. I had a fire drill once on the first

two months."
"How were the men stationed In case of
disaster?"
; "The second officer at the starboard
boat, the first officer at the port boat, the
chief engineer and his crowd at the life
raft."
"How manv seamen were there at each

"Two; they knew where they .were

Captain Mclntyre then asked for the log
book and repaired to the cabin. In a few
minutes he returned and said he thought
they would clear Cape, -Blanco by '.ten
miles. He was off watch when the ship
struck.
On cross-examination- by Captain Bolles
and Mr. Bulger, Captain Mclntyre said he
did not know how many persons were on
the ship, though he thought between'"thir
ty-nine and forty-oneJ The steamer was
drawing: 16.9 feet and was quite heavily
loaded by the bead.- - ;
"I was in my; room when she struck,"
he said, "and knew that we had struck a
rock, this by the kelp around the' ship. I
went down into the engine-room and took
off a plate to see if we were making any
water. There was no water there."
The following questions and - answers
give an idea of the course of the examina
tion and the facts, admitted by Captain
Mclntyre:
. "Did you sound any signals of distress?"
asked Captain Bolles. .
"No: Iihad a whistle that could -be
heard but a very little distance."
"Did you sound for water in other parts
of the hold?" . . .
"Yes," we got ten feet forward; she was
very much "down in the head."

there was something wrong and to put
on the air brakes. The engineer did so.
The fireman, realizing his danger,

GILROY.- Oct. 23.â The Del Monte flyer,
due here at 5:22 p. m.. was ditched in the
slough in front of the Catholic church,
about a mile from the Gilroy depot, this
evening. Considering . the location and
the rate of speed at which the train was
going at the time it seems a. miracle that
no one was killed and that only one man
was injured and he not seriously.
The train consisted of a mail, a bag
gase, a Pullman parlor car. a smoker
and two chair cars and was in charge of
Conductor Green. The engineer was J.
McCray, an old hand, and the fireman
Charles Dunbar, formerly of San Luis
Obispo.
The bridge over the slough was In
course of repairs. It was too weak to

Special Dispatch to The Call
The Russian announcement of the reoc-.
cupation of Moukden caused the Japanese
Minister, Kogoro Takahira, little concern,
but no confirmation could be obtained
from him of the report ' that ?a agree
ment had been reached whereby Japan
would net oppose Russia's continuous oc
cupation of Manchuria.
To all outward appearances the situa
tion In this regard is not bothering the
State Department. It Is declared that no
advices regarding the Far Eastern situa
tion have been received there for many
days.
This significance is deepened when *It Is
remembered that Russian Admiral Alex
ieff, at Chefu, was not disposed to discuss
the opening of Moukden as a treaty port.
The question precipitated by the reoc
cupaticn of Moukden Is: "Does Russia In
tend to oppose the opening of Moukden
by the operation of the Chinese-Amer
ican treaty?"
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 29.â An official
dispatch from Moukden, Manchuria, says:
"A detachment of Russian troops entered
the town yesterday and reoccupied the
guardhouses. This action was in conse
quence Of the weakness displayed by the
Chinese authorities, who do not fulfill
their promises, and owing to the general
ferment prevailing here."
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29.â Russia's reoc
cupation of Moukden, as announced by
the Foreign OfSce In St. Petersburg, Is
regarded as one of the most Important
recent developments In the Far East. It
is not reassuring to the United States,
for Moukden and Antung are ports to be
opened when the Chinese- American com
mercial treaty Is ratifled. The adminis
tration has emphatically made It known
that it will not take a hand In the Far
Eastern tangle unless Its treaty rights
are interfered with, but that It will re
cent any effort to close the. "open door"
at Moukden and Antung.
The movement of troops Into Moukden
is especially significant, when compared
.with dispatches from Manchuria on Oc
tober 20, which stated that Russians were
indignant at the attempt of the United
States to make Moukden an open port and
declared that they would complain' to
the St. Petersburg Government Â«"ri Mouk
den would never be opened.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Parks, while in poor health, seemed to
be full of energy throughout the day's
ordeal. Several times the prosecuting
lawyers attempted to get on record the
fact that Parks had a bank account of a

was overruled or cut short through the
strenuous efforts of counsel for the 4*~

The International executive committee
estimates that 10.0CG iron workers will be

The trial of Samuel J.' Parks, walking

tortion probably wilt be concluded to
morrow. Judge Newburger, before whom
the defendant has been on trial since
Monday, said this evening that he would
endeavor to bring the trial to a conclu
sion before Saturday.
Parks was a witness to-day. While he
admitted that a good deal of testimony
given by the witnesses for the prosecu
tion was true, he declared that many of
the accusations made against him mis
represented the facts. Two or three
times Assistant Attorney Rand gave hfm
a severe cross-lire of questions, and ap
parently had Parks in an awkward place,
but Osborne and the other lawyers for
the defense were very watchful. Â¦ and
their persistent objections to leading
questions were Invariably sustained by
the court.

After the building was cleared the fight-
Ing was continued in the street, the mob
peizing bottles and tables from near by
cafes for weapons. Shops were hastily
closed to avoid being pillaged. After the
battle the ground was strewn -with hats,
broken bottles, chairs and marble table
In the meantime showers of broken
glass. Inkstands, cuspidors and bottles
Â¦were bting hurled from neighboring win
dows. Some of the police were injured.
This shower of missiles made it necessary
to take the building^by storm and the
light which followed was desperate. The
police were armed with drawn swords and
the demonstrators in many cases wore
knuckle dusters and carried knives.
The Prefect of Police personally con
manded the operations at the Bourse de
Travail. The display of force made In the
afternoon was much greater than that of
the morning and Included the mounted
municipal guards, of whom 100 were
drawn up before the doors of the Bourse
when the meeting concluded. At first
those leaving the building w<re fairly or
derly, but they soon 'became boisterous,
whereupon Lepir.e, the Prefect, ordered
the municipal guards to station them
selves in puch a way as to force the
demonstrators to break up Into small
groups. This maneuver retarded the dis
persal of the crowd and the men then
began to Insult the police, who were
rapidly losing patience. Insults were fol
lowed by 6tone-throwlng and the munici
pal guards drew their swords.
The prefect of police says forts'-five
policemen were wounded and that more
than 100 rioter% were injured, a number
of them seriously. Thus far 100 arrests
have been made.
A terrible conflict ensued. Encouraged
by the resistance of those inside the
building, their sympathizers outside at
tacked the police. The forces of the mu
nicipality finally were victorious and
now occupy the Bourse de Travail.

BIG ATTENDANCE AT LAST
RENDITION OF "EVERYMAN"
Gentlemen's Sodality May Consider
Advisability of Repeating Presen
tation of Morality Play.
An Immense audience attended the sec
ond and last night of "Everyman" at St.
Ignatius College Hall, where"*the morality
play has received a perfect presentation
by members of the Gentlemen's Sodality.
The actors were well cast, the stage ap
propriately arranged and the music dur
ing the progress of the play and the In
tervals was befitting the scholarly work.
The philosophy of the play was admirably
interpreted by the Intelligent actors, and
the serious and quaint atmosphere was
fully realized throughout the perform
ance.
The enormous success that attended the
presentation of "Everyman" has suggest
ed to the Gentlemen's Sodality the ad
vieability of repeating the production of
the play, possibly some night next week.

city on a visit on Wednesday morning.
He had lots of money and wanted a good
time. As he was walking out of the de
i>ot at Third and Townsend streets he
was accosted by a well dressed stranger,
v.ho asked him to cash a check for $40 on
Dexter Horton & Co. of Seattle. The
stranger explained that he did not have
i, me to go to the bank, as he was to leave
on the next train. Ralston gave him the
money and pocketed the check. He went
to a "bank, but was Informed that the
check was worthless.
Yesterday morning Ralston happened to
be at the ferry and discovered the well
dressed stranger, who was going over to
Oakland. Ralston called a policeman,
who went on the boat and placed the
stranger under arrest. He was taken to
police headquarters, where he said his
name was John R. Talbot and that he
came here from New York recently on
business. He refused to say anything
about the check. He was locked up in
"the tanks" pending an Investigation as
to his antecedents. As he developed
symptoms of delirium tremens he was

Guy Huff, a bartender at Eugene, is
charged with forgery of dummy home
steaders' names by affixing them to final
proofs, which were forwarded to Wash
ington. A warrant will also be Issued
shortly for his arrest.
According to the Government theory
Mrs. Watson is the party to the con
spiracy through whom the ring came into
possession of the six homesteads. Where
Mrs. Watson is at this time the officers
do not know, but a warrant will be issued
for her arrest to-morrow.
John Doe is the officers are at this time
not prepared to say, even ir they are in
possession of the information.
The charge against Mrs. Emma L. Wat
son, who also has been Indicted, is that
of being jointly concerned with Miss
Ware, McKinley and Puter in the alleged
plot to defraud. She is Indicted as a
conspirator and the evidence considered
by the Grand Jury is to the effect that
it was she who appeared m the role of
the purchaser and bought and paid for
in the sum of 51 each the six homesteads
pretended to have been taken up and
proved upon by Robert Simpson, James
E. Warwick and four others, whose al
leged fictitious names have rigured In con
nection with the investigation of these
cases. Â¦ .Â¦..., .
Arrivals of carloads at a time have been
reported, and many of the members of these
parties were 'women. In one or two cases
during the vacation period of last summer en
tire carloads of female schoolteachers, hailing
from the ' middle Western States, made tours
to the coast and all entered lands. In other
instances entire families, of four or five per
sons each, have come in from the outside and
have made entry of lands.
So far as known no evidence of fraud has
been discovered in these specified cases, but
the officials of the department contend that.
In view of the fact that more than $400 is
required to complete the acquisition of titles
under the timber and stone law, some of these
entries are at least suspicious. - .
In other cases entries have been made in the
names of surely fictitious persons. The con

Nothing except that the ball gees rolling: on.
There have been seven indictments within a
week and there will be many more. Our suc
cess to the present time indicates pretty clearly,
I think, that our investigations have been quite
thoroughly conducted.
So far most ol the prosecutions have be^n
directed aealnst those engaged in fraudulent
proceeding*; under the timber and stone act,
and it now appears that many flagrant Irregu
larities have been* discovered in that connec
tion. Innumerable Instances of the evasion of
public land regulations by people in large
companies . have been reported to the depart
ment from day to day for the past year and
more. In many instances people have gone
to the Pacific Coast States from the States
farther East to enter lands under the timber
and stone law.

-PORTLAND. Oct. 29.â The Federal
Grand Jury to-<lay returned an indict
ment that brings to light for the first
time evidence of what rnsv have been
one of the most foul double murders ever
committed In Oregon.
The Indictment lodges against Norman
Williams a charge of forgery in affixing
a false signature of Miss Alma Nesbeit
to a reiir.quishraent of a homestead claim.
but underneath the whole procedure lies
evidence of a circumstantial nature that
murder followed in the track of forgery
or preceded it to cover up tnat crime.
Known details of the supposed tragedy
show that years ago Norman Williams
and Mis? Ain:a Nesbett were friends at
Omaha, Nebr.. and came West together.
They took up homesteads in Wasco Coun
ty end lived en adjoining claims for about
a veax. Then Mrs. Nesbett. mother of
Aliaa, came out from the East.
One stormy night in March. 19W. Wil
liams enraged a rig at Hood Rover for
the purpose of driving Mrs. Nesbett and
her daughter to their homestead, about
twenty miles. The trio dlc^pv^ared in the
dark with na evidence of the mysterious
eÂ»*quence to the ride. Williams returned.
but of the two wotacn who rode away
with him in the wild night r.o one has
heard the slightest thins:. That they were
murdered there Is in the nilnds of the
officers who hav* worked on the case no
room for doubt, and that their murder
vh deliberately planned by Williams to
gain possession of the homestead adjoin
ing his own Is their theory. The daughter
was murdered for her pr<n> c rtv. the offi
cers think, and the mother to cover up
the plot of forging the relimuishment to
â¢the homestead.
The case attracted much attention
locally. Searching parties were organ
ized, the country was scoured, but never
a trace of the missing women came to
light. Officers took the matter in hand and
attempted to work up the case, but their
efforts, too, were unsuccessful. Williams
is -thought to be In Canada, and if he can
be found the Â£5tate authorities will lodge
a charg-e cf murder against him.

FRESNO. Oct. 29. â The second day's
session of the Baptist State Convention
for Northern California and Nevada be
gan this morning at 9 o'clock with song
and grayer. The session this morning
was devoted to reports of committees
and officers. Treasurer R. H. E. Espey
presented his report, showing about
J4000 raised in the field for the exten
sion of mission work in this State.
Secretary E. R. Bennett presented 'a
report of the spiritual condition of the
work throughout the State and the
growth of the missionary fields. His re
port showed an encouraging condition of
the Baptist work in this State. A par
tial report of the committee on enroll
ment showed 119 delegates present.
Next followed the report of the com
mittee on home missions, which was
read by N. L. Freeman and showed for
the year a force of 1310 workers engaged
in mission work in North America. 120
new churches, 58S3 new converts. 55,000
addition to the Baptist church member
ship, h8,S33 attending mission Sunday
schools, 7000 scholars In schools for ne
groes and Indians and contributions
amounting to J621.387 32.
Then came the chief address of the
morning, on '"Home Missions," by Rev.
Francis Hope of the Healdsburg Church,
whose controlling thought was the prob
lem of immigration confronting this na
tion.
The shooting took place on the main
business thoroughfare and was a â¢ result
of a quarrel between Evans and the ne
gro. On Wednesday night Evans used
the negro roughly during an encounter
and "Shine" had him arrested this morn
ing. The negro armed himself with a re
volver and when the two enemies met this
afternoon the shooting was a natural cul
mination of the affair. Evans beat a has
ty retreat into the saloon when the negro
drew his weapon.
There was much excitement for a while
and talk of lynching the negro, but cooler
counsel prevailed. The negro was taken
to Fresno and placed in the county jail
for safe keeping.
SELMA, Oct. 29.â "Will Jordan, a saloon
keeper, was shot late this afternoon by a
negro, who was out gunning for another
man. The negro, a local character called
"Shine" because of his avocation as a
bootblack, shot at W. H. Evans, a livery
man, but the bullet went wide of the
mark and struck Jordan, who was in his
saloon. Jordan was wounded In the shoul

Jugular vein In its course. The physi

get together and work as one man; Pro
fessor - Frank Soule dwelt upon thesim
portance of : team work, which, he said,
was the best way to produce the biggest
noise; Roy Smith, ex-yell leader, gave a
few exhibitions showing how to get the
most noise; Sam Stow, varsity left
guard, said the team couldn't win unless
it had the support, of* the whole band of
"rooters." Assemblyman \V. H. Waste
declared he had come to "rub it into"
the" students for lack of college spirit,
but the enthusiasm to-night demonstrat
ed ' that th*ls was unnecessary. J. E.
Roadhouse-was the chairman ..of the
evening and Philip Carey the yeil leader.
This was "pajamarino" night at the

grotesque spectacle.
The "rooters", were dressed according
to their class. colors. The seniors wore
red, the juniors came in green, the soph

freshmen In blue and gold. After the

"serpentine" and â¢ twined 'innumerable

round they went, crowding and pushing,
until after a while they drifted -away

"Have you ever thought about the one
legged man. how numerous he is. what
he. does for a livelihood?" asked an ob
servant man. "Well, I suppose you have
without paying much attention to what
you were thinking about. You will find
many men who are thus afflicted quite
as well off in the affairs of the world aa
men who still retain both of their lower
limbs. Many of the brave soldiers who
took cart In the little skirmish of the
sixties left the fighting: with one leg, or
they were wounded in such a way that
they lost the limb afterward because am
putation Â¦ became necessary. Frequently
this condition â¢ confronted the wounded
soldier many years after the war. So
there are many one-legged men who are
prominent in all the professions and in
all the business affairs of the country.
"But I was thinking of another class
of men, men who are not, for one reason
and another, fitted for the more respon
sible positions in life, the class of men
who perforce fall into the moat conven
ient grooves for the aims and responsi
bilities which beset them. He Is a boot
black now and then, and we find him
lounging on the corner, waiting for some
good customer who will give him the us
ual allowance for a shine. Sometimes
we will find him at other things which
do not reaulre too much leg work.' as
the saying goes. But I had in mind a still
more curious fact in connection with the
calling of â¢ the one-legged man. - Did you
know that fully 90 per cent of the rall-
Toad flagmen in the United States are
one-legged men? Did you know that fully
90 per cent of the men who sweep out
the srooves and who grease them, at the
curves on street railway lines are one
legged men? It is a fact, whether you
know it or not. and a little closer ob
servation will convince you of It. So you
find â¢ the one-legged man at crossing of
the roads, ana your lifers often In his
hands. If he naus he may whiff your
candle out. Or if he should give a false
signal for some reason something might
happen to a whole trainload of people.
So true Is it that the one-legged man iÂ»
the flagman In all the plays where It
has been necessary to introduce him. the
flagman is one-legged. The verdict of the
stage Is not always good, but in this re
spect I am inclined to think that no mis
take has been made. So. after all. the
one-legged man plays an important and
responsible Â»art in the affairs of thÂ«

in regard to athletic contests. One
of these is that the Intercollegiate foot

to be played at Berkeley. The other Is that
the freshmen play three games instead of one.
and these to be played In February of each

baneball and track events, which thÂ« commit
tee* think ought to be held. The fourth change
bears on the colors to be worn by the football

As soon as they were out of sight tha
alarm was given and the brideless groom
was told that his wife had been stolen
and carried away in a hack. He thought
at first that she was hidden in the house,
but after a thorough search, found that
she was not there and, securing another
carriage, started In pursuit of the kid
napers. They had a long start, however,
and were not overtaken and the groom.
after, a search that lasted until Ions after
midnight, returned to the desolated home
to report the failure of his quest. As ha
entered the house he was met by his
'kidnaped' wjf^ who, demurely asked him
where he had been spending the evening.
The bride is the daughter of the late W.
T. Jones, a well known mining man of
East Oakland. She Is a sister of Mrs.
W. J. Webber and Mrs. W. Reid Plunkett.
The groom's home Is in Portland. Or.,
and he is a well known and popular aa
sayer. The young couple' will probably
make their home in this city.

HIS Broadway, Oct. 20. i
To have his bride kidnaped and earrie*
off less than an hour after being married
was the misfortune that befell Harry
Dunning Lee, chief chemist of the Con
fidence cyanide plant of Tuolumne Coun
ty, last night. The youjig man had Just
been joined in wedlock to Miss Geneve
Jones of 1529 Ninth avenue, and while
friends were congratulating the bride, the
youngr husband stepped Into another
room for a moment to speak to his moth
er-in-law, Mrs. W. T. Jones.
While he was absent the bride was en
ticed to the front door on the pretext
that fhere was a message for her, when
a shawl was thrown over her head and
she was picked up by Dr. B. D. Williams,
who carried her to a waiting carriage.
Miss Helen Lloyd, a cousin of the bride,
and Fred Le Balister entered the carriage
with them and they were quickly driven
away.
After a chase half around the world
and the capture of Julius Jorgensen, ac
cused of absconding with $8000 of the
funds of a bank in which he was em
ployed in Denmark, word has been re
ceived that he is apt to go free, as the
evidence against him Is not sufficient
without the testimony of Johanna Mul
ler, the bank stenographer who eloped
with him, and who is now living at
Golden Gate with her child. She refuses
to return and testify against him. and
the Danish Consul now fears that the
prosecution will fail in Denmark.
When Jorgensen left here to return in
company with the officers he stated that
he would come back as soon as possible.
The maximum punishment for the crime
of which he was charged is very 'light
there and it was argued that as the sen
tence begins as soon as the person Is
taken into custody the months spent in
Jail here would leave him less than a
year to serve. Miss Muller is living here
and waiting for his return.
In explanation of his act, Jorgensen
said his married life had not been a suc
cess and he, ran away with his type
writer. He also took" his two children
with him. They came to this country
and traveled through the East and
finally drifted to Oakland, to which place
the officers tracked them by their bag
gage. His two children, a girl and a
boy. were sent back with him. While
here a child was born to Miss Muller,
and when he left she was given an op
portunity to earn a living for herself and
offspring. They had spent less than
$2000 of the money, and there is still
something more than $6000 in two of the
local banks here, which he deposited and
which has been tied up. by the courts.
Information brought here at the time
of Jorgensen's arrest was to the effect
that his peculation had been very clev
erly covered up by his bookkeeping and
that wit,hout^the stenographer's testi
mony it would be very difficult to fasten
the taking of the money upon him.

Charles McCondah, were both drowned
in the accident to the little craft, which
was caught in a. Jieavy blow while on
the way from San Francisco to the-Mor
gan Oyster Company's beds at Millbrae.
The schooner was loaded with ice and
packing boxes, piled high on the - deck.
When the heavy wind struck her she cap
sized, and sank before . a , move could be
made by Captain Gustavsen. The four
men in the crew went down, the fourth
man. being E. M. Mikkelsen, the. mate.
The captain and mate clung to the small
boat, but Larsen and McCondah sank al
most immediately.
The dav of the disaster Mrs. Larsen
and the Larsens' three children arrived
in England, en route to Sweden to [ visit
the old home. Larsen was about 35 years
of age and had long been in the oyster
company's employ, j He was well known
along the water front in San Francisco.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
OAKLAND, Oct. 29.â Petition was filed
to-day for permission to change the
name of the Brooklyn Banking Company
to that of the South Berkeley Bank. The
location of the bank Is to be changed
from that part of Oakland known r.s
Brooklyn to South Berkeley, where tne
majority of the stockholders live.
Bank Changes Name.
Cuvellier and Wallace spoke at length
ia favor of the test, as did Councilman
Howard, who argued that the plan pre
sented a solution of the problem and
would settle the controversy.
A special meeting of the street com
mittee has bee^ called for Thursday
evening, November 5, to consider the pro
posed Improvement of Telegraph and
Sen Pablo avenues.
Councilman Elliot of the Second Ward
spoke against the resolution, declaring
that the argument of the protestants was
simply one of sentiment against the ex
ihtence of the crematory.
**If some one must be sacrificed for the
general g-ood, as suggested by Mr. Good
ffilow;" 6ald Elliott, "why- not build the
crematory of marble and put it in the
heart of the city or In the lakeside dis
trict? Make It a sacrifice fit for the
gods. Don't compel a few poor property
owners to puffier."
Councilman Cuvellier uncovered the
fact that P. A. Sexton, onÂ© of the hard
est protestants, had sold some of his
property to ttie Incinerating company.
"That Is so?" Queried the Councilman
of Sexton, who was in. the lobby. "Yes,
but I have more property out there." re
plied Sexton, "and I am still against the
crematory-"
OAKLAND, Oct 29.â The ordinance
and Judiciary committee of the
City Council to-night by a vote of three
to two recommended that Councilman
John L. Howard's resolution to give the
Pacific Incinerating Company's plant a
thirty <5ays* test be adopted. The vote
Ftood: For the resolution, Cuvellier, Wal
lace and Howard; against, Elliott and
XlcAdams. It was not without a hot pas
sage of words among representatives of
the company and the protesting Second
Warders that the resolution reached a
vote. Attorney J. IL Creeley, for the
Protestants, declared that if the plant
should be opened he would immediately
p<> to the courts.
"You have no right," announced the
lawyer, "to run this crematory in a resi
dence district. It is a nuisance of itself
tind I am prepared to go Into court and
stop its operation If we can."
W. S. Goodfellow. appearing for the
first time as counsel for the incinerating
company, said: "We are perfectly willing
to meet the protestants in the courts.
What harm can be done by making the
V>et? If It be a nuisance then the test
will settle It for all time. If It be not a
nuisance the people ought to be satisfied
to know that."
The attorney declared that the old con
tract, under which the plant had been
built, was a valid one, and that the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals In
the San Francisco Reduction Works case,
recently decided, had established the law
so strongly thai the contract was abso
lutely upheld. He suggested that the
new contract presented by Mr. Dornln
was in the nature of a compromise and
was acceptable to the company, which
would concur with its terms to bring
about a friendly feeling.

cinerating Company

City Attorney Simpson also persuaded
the lawyer for the Southern Pacific to be
satisfied with the three switch tracks in
use at the west end of Pacific avenue, al
though the management asked to be per
mitted to have five tracks there. In ad
dition to this Mr. Simpson was assured
by Mr. Herrin that his company would,
after taking up Its tracks on Railroad
avenue from Eighth street west, repair
and macadamize that portion of the thor
oughfare now occupied by the -roadbed.
"Bald grantee shall not use any portion
of the main line of said railroad herein
described/ except that portion extending
from the Harrison-street bridge to the
roadway between Webster street and
Eighth street In the city of Alameda, for
the transportation of freight other than
freight destined to or from Alameda."
In the draft of the franchise for the
south side line the freight clause reads:
"No freight except that destined to or
from the city of Alameda, or to or from
points on the railroad of said grantee ex
tending from the city of Alameda to the
city of Santa Cruz, shall be transported
over the main line herein described be
tween the eastern boundary of the city of
Alameda and Alameda Point."

OMAHA. Nebr.. Oct. 23.â From Rock
Island officials in this city it Is learned
that the decision of the executives of the
Santa Fe to construct a $10,000,000 cutoff
near Albuquerque, N. M., arises from. the
failure of the two railroads to reach an
agreement for the Joint use of the Rock
Island tracks in Kansas and New Mex
ico. The Santa Fe proposes to build SO
miles of railroad to shorten Its line five
miles-. The project Is of more Interest
and importance than any of recent years,
because It .will result in the shortest line
from. . Chicago to Los Angeles and San
Francisco and the saving of $*XU>JO an
nually on operating expenses.
The five miles which the Santa Fe la
paying $10,000,000 to avoid Is close to Albu
querque. Half a mile Is between that
city and La Junta. This short distance
of the work will take nearly all the
money. The other four and a half miles
are not considered material. What counts
is thÂ« 2000 feet difference In altitude be
tween the Raton 'Mountain, the highest
point ! on the present line, and Abo Pass.
the highest point en the proposed cutoff.

To justify the expensive " charge ~Â± 9
Santa Fe must save in its operator ex
penses at least 4 uer cent Interest oa
$K>.<X3Q.Â«X>. This Is $400,000 a year, or about
S3 a day for each exile of tha road be
tween Albuquerque aad La Junta. The
fuel to run the engines over the proposed
cutoff must be abcu: 330 tons less si day
than at present is ecssused to cove the
same amount of freight. All this has been
carefully figured out by the 3antaÂ»"Fe
experts. - The ccst has* been counted'' and
the road will be tui'.t.
Southwest was mere successful m secur
ing. traCc To be a competitor the Santa
Fe j realized that It zaust eliminate - the
mountain climbing.
As It is the freight - traffic, which en
ables a road to pay dividends, as long
as the Santa Fe Is obliged to haul thou
sands of carloads of through freight over
the 350 miles of steep grade between La
Junta and Albuquerque it was wasting
Immense sums of money ta fuel, repairs
and general , operating expenses which
stockholders might 'as well receive. Not
only that, but the- Rock Island with Its
tangent line across the tablelands of the
climb . of 1S3. These grades are
at Abo Pass only. The rest of the road
is over the level New Mexico prairies.
Industrially the construction of the cut
off Is of even greater Importance. It will
give Kansas City a second MOO-mlle track
into the heart of New Mexico and will
open up a new cattle grazing country of
great promise. With Irtue or no differ
ence in the grades of the respective roads,
the Santa Fe win have thÂ« shortest line
between Chicago and Los Acgeles by
nineteen miles: between Chicago and San
Francisco by 1SS miles, and between Kan
sas City and San Francisco by 129 miles.
But the Rock Island wul still retain the
shortest line between Kansas City and
Los Angeles by forty miles and between
Kansas City and El Paso by 143 miles.
The Santa Fe will have the advantage on
the long hauls, but L~e Rock Island sur
passes its rival on the short hauls.

POKTI*ANI>. Or., Oct. 23.â The giant
blast fired at the Br^by quarry yester

was an. expensive proceeding: for all con

wrought unexpected havoc
In the first place, instead of simply
shattering: the rc*ck without moving it
any considerable distance, the explosion
threw the side cf the mountain so far out
that GcvenMuent engineers estimate that
fully 50.C00 tons of rock fell into thÂ© Co

worth nothing.
In addition to this the tracks of the rail

HENRY J. CROCKER, AT THE NOON HOUR, SPEAKS TO WAGE EARNERS AT THE PACIFIC MAIL DOCK.
AS tee campaign draws to a close
Henry J. Crocker is developing
greater strength. Wherever he
went yesterday he was received
with great enthusiasm. His voice was
heard by thousands and his hand
was grasped by enthusiasts who prom
ised to vote for the man who represents
clean government and who promises the
'people of San Francisco " two years of
hopest service.
The Republican standard-bearer at
tended four meetings last night, and his
speeches won many votes for himself and
the rest of the ticket. Wherever Mr. Croc
ker went he was greeted with great en
thusias-m. In Ruef's supposed stronghold,
the Forty-fifth Assembly District, the
Republican nominee for Mayor addressed
1000 voters. The statement had been
made by the opposition that when Mr.
Crocker attempted to hold a meeting in
that district he would only have fifteen
people in the halL This was disproved
last night by the Immense crowd which
filled Washington-square Hall. There
are hundreds of good Republicans over
there as well of Democrats and Union
Labor men. That the Democrats and
T'nion Labor men will desert the stan
dards of Schmitz and Lane Is certain.
Crocker buttons were proudly worn by
men who toil, and their cheers were loud.
After hearing his voice and heeding the
sincerity of his promises they came
away, like the others, determined to
stand by Henry J. Crocker.
Manzanita Hall, Teutonia Hall and
Mangel Hall were also crowded with cit
izens, who waited patiently for the com
ing of the next Mayor of Ban Francisco
When he did arrive he was greeted with
great cheering.
The various other candidates on the
ticket were also given splendid receptions.
General E. S. Salomon, William E. Lutr,
Percy V. Long. Judges Joachimsen and
Sweeney and George H. Bahra were
heard at all the meetings and won lots of
.votes. Judge Bahrs was given a fine re
ception in the Forty-fifth District, where
he was born and educated.
VOTERS CHEER FOR CROCKER.
The meeting in the Forty-fifth Assem
bly District last night was a pronounced
victory for the Republican party. Wash
ington Square Hall, corner Stockton and
Green streets, was packed to Its doors.
Hundreds of voters who were unable to
find seats etood for an hour for the priv
ilege of listening to the addresses of the
various candidates. This district has
been claimed by Abe Ruef, and, despite
the" fact that Mayor Schmitz was hold
ing a meeting In the vicinity, the voterri
of the district came to' hear Henry J.
Crocker, the man destined to become the
next chief executive of this municipaVty.
The reception tendered to Mr. Crocker
was a flattering one. His arrival in the
ha.Il was made apparent to the residents
in the vicinity by loud cheering. The band
attempted to play something at this Junc
ture, but the plaudits for the Republican
nominee drowned the blare of trumpets.
Tn> meeting was one of the best held in
the district and proved" to- many that
Henry J. Crocker as the representative of
the party of Roosevelt Is worthy of the
hieh honor accorded him.
There were hundreds of ladles in the
hall and the fair^ex joined in the acclaim
for the clean-cut candidate who appear
ed before them. Mr. Crocker's speech
was without frills. He talked to the as
sembled citizens in a language they
. 7~Serstood. He did not make Idle prom
ises nor did he indulge in personalities.
He told of the needs of the city and of
the vast sums of money to be spent in
improving and beautifying it and he mod
estly set forth his claims as the right
man to fill the Important position of over
seeing the expenditure of the money.
John S. Partridge opened the meeting
with a stirring speech. "On behalf of the
campaign committee of a united and
â¢whole-Fouled Republican party.'.' he said.
'â¢I des=lrÂ© to thank you for this splendid
outburst of patriotism to-night. I have
gone from one end oC the city to the
other; I have gone from the Thirty-fifth
District to the Forty-first on the north;
from the Thirty-ninth on the west to the
water front, and never In my life, no mat
ter what the issues were. I .have never
â¢sen such a determined idea that a man
would win as I have found for your
standard-bearer, Henry J. Crocker.
(Great applause.)
"Your enthusiasm is an earnest of the
way you are going to tvote. There are
three candidates in. the field, and I have
not heard a Republican say one solitary
word against either of* the other candi
dates, but I do say that the Republican
Municipal Convention went forth into the
.highways and byways of this city and
county and looked one man over and an
other man over, and finally out of the
great press of good men we Just found
one man who could lead this city out of
the Elough of despond, and we found such
a man in that little giant of the West,
that Theodore Roosevelt of the Pacific
Coast, Henry J. Crocker. (Applause.)
"He stands before* you, and any nian
may look upon him. Ho Is the repre
sentative of all that is best in American
manhood. His whole life Is an open book.
On behalf of the campaign committee I
make this pledgeâ If you elect Henry J.
Crocker Mayor this city will take a for
ward movement and will take her place
as the queen of the Pacific. If you elect
Kenry J. Crocker you will have a
straightforward government, and there is
going to be an end, thank God, of graft
forever. , (Applause.) Ladles and gentle
men, on behalf of the campaign commit
tee I take pleasure in introducing Dr.
Campbell Ford, chairman of this meet
ing." (Applause.) . s?Vc^
Dr. Ford said he appreciated It a great
honor to preside at the meeting, as it
â¢was the biggest ' Republican gathering
ever held in the district. He introduced
Percy V. Long as the next City Attorney
of San Francisco. Mr. Long spoke as
follows:
CROCKER WELL RECEIVED.
"You will not hear a speech from me,
as I am eiraply here to bo Introduced to
you collectively. . I know many of you
personally. While I do not Intend to
make a speech, I want to call your atten
tion to a few things that every voter in
San Francisco ought to bear in mind. The
voters of San Francisco for the last eight
or nine years in national politics have
shown their allegiance to the Republican
party; have shown their 'belief. In the
policies passed by. the party in the halls
of legislation; and it seems to me, when
this city is about to expend a great deal
of money for its improvement, that the
Republican party is the party to handle
these larce suns which are to be ex
pended." ; v

Theodore Lunstedt and Robert Vance,
candidates for Supervisors; John J.

Judge Bahrs, candidate for Assessor,
were represented at the meeting and
their friends did excellent campaign
work in their behalf.
The largest meeting was at Garibaldi
Hall. .Alfred Roncovieri presided and
many of the labor candidates made
speeches. Mayor Schmitz was greeted
with cheers and made a brief speech. He
dwelt upon his record, saying that it
was all that he had to stand on in this
fight for re-election. Peace, he said, was
what the laboring man wanted. He had
given. them peace during his administra
tion and would give the same if elected
again. He denounced the papers for say
ing that his meetings were composed of
hoodlums, and said that if that was the
case he was proud of his associates. The
Mayor gave special thanks, to the ladies,
saying that they could assist him a great
deal by taking up his fight.
In closing he said: "Vote for. me on the
Sd of November and roll up the biggest
majority that the city has ever seen, and
it will be heralded throughout the United
States that San Francisco, unaided by
any newspaper, has triumphed for the
cause of justice and right."
During the Mayor's speech he was re
peatedly interrupted by shouts from some
alleged funny men in the 1 audience, emu
lating a habit that has proved distasteful
to the people who have been attending
the Schmitz meetings. The crowd was in
terspersed with numerous boys and hood
lums, who were endeavoring to make as
much fun of the meeting as possible.

the Mayor and other candidates. The

At Garibaldi Hall James A. Devoto. the
orator of the . labor . ticket, in scathing
terms denounced Lane and Crocker and
dwelt on the fancied vices of these two
candidates, and did not attempt to say
anything that would tend to elevate In
the minds of his audience the characters
of the party candidates that he is work

Tenth, last night. Ex-Senator Ed
win I. "Wolfe was the orator of the even
in?. In the course of his address he said
the Republican party was united and that
the nominees of the convention were men
who stood high in the community and
were entitled to the support of all good
citizens. He said If Mr. Crocker was
elected Mayor of San Francisco he would
be his own master â that no one would
own him. He said he was a man of busi
ness experience and represented the "high
est type of manhood. He spoke of his in
tegrity and honesty of purpose, and as
sured the voters that he was not an aris
tocrat and would treat all with whom he
came In contact with fairness and impar
tiality.
Speeches were also made by Joseph Ny

Morris I* Asher, candidates for Super
visors: Judges Joachlmsen and Sweeney,
candidates for Police Judges; William E.
Lutz, candidate for Public Administrator.
and General E. S. Salomon, candidate for
District Attorney.
Mr. Crocker's entrance was the signal
for hearty cheering. Throughout his
speech he was applauded, and when he
departed for another meeting the audi
ence loudly pheered him. In his speech to
the voters present he said: â¢
"I see a good many of my friends here
to-night and some who are for other can-'
didates in the field. That la perfectly
right. I want to say this for the other
candidates: They are my personal
friends. I have never said a word against
them in this campaign and I want to say
they have treated me with respect. I,
know the campaign i3 drawing to a close.
We are all getting a little bit excited. I
am reported to have given up the fight,
but I am still on deck and will be on
deck until the end of the campaign and
thereafter. (Applause.) I want to thank
the people of this city for the honor they
have conferred upon me. This is the first
time In my life that I have been out of
employment and I want you people to
hire me, and if you do I will give you a
good return for the investment. (Ap
plause.) If you will place me In the
Mayor's chair and honor me beyond my
deserts I assure you I will give you a
good administration. I was brought up
in this city. Everything I own In the
world I owe to this city. If I have been
successful it Is due to my effort*, i Let
me tell you I am no class nominee. You
boys and many of the men here know me
from the ground up.
"I am accused of being an aristocrat
and a steam beer campaigner. They
don't go well together, but I seem to
embody both these elements. (Ap
plause.) IÂ£ I am an aristocrat, ladies ami
gentleman. I shall do honor to tha posi
tion of Mayor of San Francisco. If I am
a steam beer campaigner I give you my
word that when you come up to tha
City Hall you won't have to knuckle tr>
some side-show to learn if the Mayor is
in. There will be no intermediary.. I
will do the business of this city for my
clients, who are the people of San Fran
cisco. I guarantee that every dollar shall
go to the worklngman for a good days
work, and In return it shall be seen that
these worklngmen give to the city a fair
return for the money received. (Ap
plause.)
"You want sanitary conditions In this
city. You want to see your children
grow up and the death rate lessened, and
that is the reason why you have voted
for the bonds to build new sewers."
The speaker promised to treat all peo
ple with equal justice and promised a.
clean administration. Other speakers,
followed and the sentiments expressed
were applauded.
"When 20.000 of you men signed a peti
tion and sent It to the Mayor asking him'
to appoint David I. Mahoney a ! Police 1
Commissioner did he do it? No! Abe
Ruef wouldn't let him, because Ruef
wanted his friend Drinkhouse put In that
position, so you 20,000 were turned down
because the boss ordered it so.,
"That appointment was made to build
up a political scheme. Do you want Abe
Ruef to run this city? If you don't, vote
for me. If you want a Mayor who will
give you a clean government and be. ready
to receive and listen to every class of peo
ple on exactly the same terms, then you
can cast your ballot for* me."
Daniel Harrington was chairman of the
meeting. Addresses were also made by
Carl Westerfeld, Dr. Dodge, Judge Ca
baniss, T. Carey Friedlander, Judge Mo
gan and P. J. Curtis. . . -.
Lane next spoke to the voters of the
Thirty-first Assembly District at the Po
trero Opera-house on Tennessee street,
near Eighteenth, lie said he .saw many
in the audience he had seen in the same
hall five years ago when he first started
in to make his political speeches in this
city. He thanked them for the support
they had alway9 given him, and felt and
knew that they took a friendly interest in
him and he was assured he would have
their aid in the battle on Tuesday next.,
"I want to thank you, one and all," ha
said, ."and I want you all to know that I ,
appreciate what you have done for me.
I have always tried to pursue a straight
forward, honest and manly course and I
think and am sure you believe me. . I
want you to lift yourselves away from
partisanship and stand up for rood gov
ernment. Be true to yourselves and you
will be loyal to this great city of .San
Francisco, which you all love so well and
of which you are all so proud. To do this
you must get away from Abe Ruef and
his factions and for the welfare of the
city you must be patriots and rise, above
any political machine and any political
boss. Wipe out class lines. Vote for the
men who will give you a clean adminis
tration.
"There never have been such meetings
as I have attended the past few days.
Everywhere I have talked to the capaci
' ties of the different hall3 In which I haw
spoken, and I have seen in my audience
men of every class and station in life an<S
all have given strict attention to what I
have said in regard ! to good government
and the parties that are governed by a
political | boss.
"When I started out on this campaign
the word was passed around on every
side, 'Lane isn't In it.* There I3 a mighty
different sentiment In the land now, for
'Lane 13 very much In it.'
."People on every side are now rallying

Franklin K. Lane addressed three big
meetings last night and at each was re
ceived with enthusiasm and applause.
He first spoke to the voters or the Thirty
second Assembly District at Masonic Hall
on Fourteenth street, near Railroad ave
nue. He began his remarks by thanking
the ladies who filled the galleries for
coming to listen to him and begged them
all to take an earnest interest in the
coming election. He said in part: "You
have a great stretch of i water front out
here, and. what are, you go:ng to do with
it? Do. you realize . the great value of
this waterway? The heart of the water
front is now almost completely monopo
lized by corporations, watch your water
front here. It will be a tremendous asset
within the next twenty years to all you
holders of property in this district.' Every
foot of it should be reserved for the ben
efit of you and yours and not be allowed
to pass into the control or corporations.
None of this waterway should be tied
up in a monopoly. Many of you j here
were leaders in the Union Labor party
and it was your idea and wisn that this
party, should represent, you and your
views', but to-day, you know it does not.
It represents the views of a*, boss and
that boss is Abe Ruef. You tried to es
tablish a , third party, .which was to be
essentially a party, to represent the labor
man, and you wanted to show the people
that , the laboring men were capable of

affairs a clean and high-class government.
You wanted the country to know that the

Mr. Long then paid a high tribute to
Henry J. Crocker and the other candi
dates on the ticket.
Henry H. Lynch, candidate for Sher
iff, was also given a hearty greeting when
introduced. He said he was not a speech
maker, but if elected" he would do his ut
most to conduct the office In an honorable
manner and would give equal justice to
all men.
George Dletterle, candidate for Super

for many years and was aware of the
needs of the community. "This Is the
first time I have, been a candidate for

shall do my duty to the people who placed
me in office." . ,
Morris Asher, another candidate for Su

a warm welcome by his many friends in
the audience. Mr. Asher was for many
years a resident of the North Beach and
is well liked by the residents of that
section of the city. In behalf, of his as
sociates on the ticket, he said they were
men of integrity and would do everything
in their power if elected to assist Mayor
Crocker in giving the city a clean ad
ministration. .
Mr. Crocker was presented at this time
and the cheering was renewed. The re
ception to the standard bearer was a
whole-souled one and warmed the cockles
of his heart.
""Before I start in speaking to-night.'
he said, "I would like to ask a question.
Are the people of this district used to
seeing ghosts? (Laughter.) Do I look
like a ghost? I met the Democratic
nomjnee for Mayorâ excuse me. I met
Gavin McNab (laughter ana applause) on
the street the other night and I said,
'Gavin, you are not treating me right.'
'How is that, Henry?' he said. 'You
burled me and laid me quietly to rest,' I
answered, 'and I don't think you ought
to disturb me.' 'Unfortunately, Henry,'
paid McNab, 'you are onÂ© of that kind of
people who never stay dead.' (Laughter,)
"Ladles and gentlemen, â¢ you have no
doubt watched this campaign with a
great deal of interest. You have watched
the candidates and -have become ac-Â«
quainted with them; you have got to
know them; you, know what they say

the time when you have got to say,
'What are we going to do?' I know what

"For the past twenty- six years I have
worked for a man and his name is Henry

help him forward and keep him clean
before the world and maKe him a man
of integrity."
. When Mr. Crocker concluded he ' left
the hall and on his way out he was
cheered and his hand was grasped by
scores of voters, who pledged their sup
port. . .
JUDGE BAHRS SPEAKS.
Judge George H. Bahrs, candidate for
Assessor, was the next speaker ; intro
duced. This whirlwind campaigner had
lots of friends in the hall, judging by the
reception he was given. Every chance
they had the voters of the district cheered
Judge Bahrs. They laughed 1 at his clever
shots at his opponent and applauded his
statements. He was born in the district,
educated in the public schools, acted as
Janitor in those schools, worked as a
soapmaker and by .dint of hard- work
gained the approval of the people who
placed him in office.
"It was in this district," he said, "at the
grammar school on Filbert strept, that I
was educated. On Powell and Vallejo
streets I spent a great many years of my
boyhood. This is not the first time I have
been engaged In a campaign, and let me
tell you the voters of the Forty-fourth
and Forty-fifth districts have always
given Judge Bahrs the highest vote. If
you will look back at the records when
Judge Bahrs was running for Superior
Judge, he received more votes for the of
fice than any other* candidate on the
ticket. Is it at all strange that I feel
proud to bo before you to-night? I am
supposed to be the candidate who .'. en
tered this campaign .without a ghost of a
chance. They thought I was getting, a
gold brick, but they reckoned without
Judge Bahrs and without his friends, for
the moment it was announced that Bahrs
was nominated his friendsâ and he num
bers them" by the thousands on North
Beach â began to roll up this little
snowball day by day until now it has
reached such proportions that Dr. Wash
ington Dodge is growing hysterical over
the proposition. He is practically being
smothered. (Applause.) He is practically
being smothered by' the friendship that
has been rolled up for Judge Bahrs.
"The Examiner accuses me of making: a
gutter campaign. If making a gutter
campaign is going over to the Union Iron
Works and meeting the workingmen and
grasping each by the hand and thanking
them for their support; if visiting the
sugar refinery at the Potrero and meeting
the men employed there; if It la going to
the Fulton Iron Works and securing the
support of the worklngman, then I am'
making a gutter campaign and I am
proud of it" (Great applause.)
. The Judge declared that he did not say
he had the German vote in his vest
pocket, as a morning paper reported him
saying, but that he had reason, to believe
that he would, have the German vote to a
man and that the French, Italian, Greeks
and; other races would vote for him, and
his election was assured. A man in the
audience assured him, he had the Swiss
vote and others made like assurances. â¢;.

BOSTON. Oct. 23.-On arrival of the

dock to-day Vehtan Krikorian, an Arme

Scotland Yard on a charge of being ac
cessory before the fact of the murder of
Sagatel Sagoual on Tuesday. Krikorian
claimed that his object In coming to this
ccuntry was to attend lectures at Har
vard, but on being searched only 35 was
found In his possession. He will be ar
raigned before a United States Commis
sioner to-morrow.
The police deem the arrest of the utmost
importance. The prisoner denies any
knowledge of a conspiracy to kill SagounI
and appeared surprised to hear of the
tragedy. He admitted that he knew the
murdered man and that he had attended
several meetings of the Revolutionary So
ciety in London before bis departure for
this country. He denied that he belonged
to any revolutionary society.
Krikorian said he was a) years old and
a graduate of the American College in
Constantinople. For the last three years,
he told the offlcers, he lived In London,
maintaining himself by Journalistic corre
epecfleace and other writings. He ex
pected to cover his expenses at Harvard

Voters of San Francisco Grow Enthusiastic for the
Republican Nominee.
THERE Is not the slightest doubt
that Peter J. Curtis obtained the
Union Labor party nomination
for Sheriff on an agreement to
surrender one-half or a good share of
the patronage of the office to Schmitz
and Ruef. The latter had absolute con
trol of the Union Labor Convention. All
that Ruef had to do In the execution of
a programme was to tell Schmitz what
he wanted. The Mayor then pressed the
button and Tom Eagan "did the rest."
The Democratic Convention made a hard
and fast rule that not one of the nomi
nees should accept a nomination from
another political party. Candidates were
pledged to abide by this rule, but the
pledge did not deter Curtis from dicker
ing with the manager of the Labor con
vention.
A story now comes to light to the ef
fect that a well-known resident In the
city, who was strongly In favor of
Schmitx for Mayor In the campaign of
1901, but who Is now supporting the can
didacy of Henry J- Crocker, was waited
assertion. "I am gaining every day," by
saying, "Yes, I know you are. and I am
glad to hear it and wish you success."
Among others greeting Mr. Crocker was
Charles Mlnert, president of the Sugar
Workers' Union. The candidate made a
favorable Impression on the union man
as evidenced by bis remark. "IÂ£ they
were all like you we might equalize
things and come together better." Some
times there were a large group ot busy
workmen together. Mr. Crocket was In
troduced to several of these with the re
mark. "This is Mr. Crocker, boys, aon't
forget him." The answer came in a
prompt and emphatic way, "We'll not
forget him." From, a group :n the en
gine-room came the open expression of
confidence. "We'll vote for you. all
right."
GEBMA1TS ABE FOB CBOCKEB.
The Germans are for Crocker. There
is no doubt that his genuine heartiness of
nature is akin to that for which they are
noted. Crocker asked one German how
he' liked the rousing meeting held the
night before in the Potrero. "It was all
right. Lots of the people changed their
opinion and their vote after you spoke."
came the answer. Another said. "I be
lieve you are our friend, and I'll give you
a vote, anyhow."
When Crocker left the works he called
"Good luck" to the busy men around
him. and they cried, "The same to you.
and we hope to see you elected." That Is
plain enough to show which way the
wind is blowing. t A young teamster lead
ing the works with his heavy wagon was
made happy by the next Mayor tumbling
In behind and riding as far as the Union
Iron Works with him. a i'Â£'> Â¦â¢'.. ' Â¦_
The^atter place, with Its more than 3000
men, was reached about noon, and the
men as they came out for lunch recog
nized Mr. Crocker and many of them
stopped for a word and a handshake.
This was but the opening for a reception
later, which proved that the first- visit
made to the works some weeks ago by
Henry J. Crocker has been remembered
and borne good fruit. His visit yesterday
but marked a successful climax. After
luncheon at the yards dining-room Mr.
Crocker visited several of the ships In
course of construction. From the hatch
ways and turrets of the Ohio and the Ta
coma came the men. glad to give a mo
ment from their tasks to show their lik
ing for Crocker and their pleasure to
greeting him. Crocker buttons were in
demand and many of the men were wear
ing them. It was noticeable throughout
the day's trip that' those wearing Schmitx
buttons were mostly minors. Lane but
tions were" not numerous. As one
man remarked; "Lane and ScbmltzUl split
the vote- between them all right, and
there'll be plenty of room for Crocker to
get In." One man came up with" the re
quest for a button with .the remark: "I
bad my little girl cheering for you at the
meeting last night. Mr. Crocker." He got
a gilt-framed button. ,sent by the candi
date himself to the little lady. One man
called out: "Mr. Crocker, the fire boys
all over town are putting in a good word
for you. And I'll give you one good vote
If you never 'get another."
'Tim Rlordan, treasurer; of the Pipe Fit
ters* Union, was out yesterday , at the
works In favor, of Lane, but the most he
seemed to accomplish was to get into sev
eral scraps with some Schmitx men.; In
the molding shop things were almost solid
; for Crocker. * and he.: was greeted with
warm assurances of. support by the men
on this, "his second visit to them. Said a
man*,there::"You're agood man. and we
want <J to see Â« you walk ' right In. Things
look " mighty good for you here now. and
If -; we can't i hold "out a few days longer
; we're .not much good." ; # -
< MEETS ; OLD .. ACQTJ AIBTTAirCE.
j . In 'one department Mr. Crocker ' had : a
i pleasant meeting . with Â¦ Jake ;_ Holton. : a
, lumber tailier." whom; he had known
twenty years ago and whom he recog
nized. Holton turned to a fellow work
in gman as Mr. Crocker moved away and
said: "Henry was always a nice, whole
souled fellow, and success has not
changed him." And that's the way many
of these men who toll think of Henry J.
Crocker. And that thought of him will do
much to bring him many -of their votes.
"After the reception of yesterday the
hand of the Republican candidate looked
a duplicate of that of the hardest worker
In the ranks. Almost everything had
touched it, from sugar to soot. Crocker
does not mince matters in handshaking.
From the Union Iron Works the Risdon
Works were next visited, and the same
greetings, marked by the same good feel
tEgs, were exchanged by the. men with
Mr. Crocker. Not one man out of the
hundreds employed there but wa3 glad to
see him. That finished up the ten miles
of greetings, and it was well along In the
afternoon before Mr. Crocker regained
his office, tired but thoroughly pleased
and satisfied with his day of campaigning.
The Norwegian Club Fram is not sup
porting Lane. John Ferem. president of
the club, is Indignant that such a thing
has been said of it. even by an unreliable
evening paper. Mr. Ferem said yester
day: "icis not true that the Fram Club
is indorsing Mr. Lane. I shall call a
meeting of the club for the express pur
pose of having the members of the club
say so. Bach member of thÂ« club Is at
liberty to declare for himself, but I can
say they are not for Lane. The club Is
almost entirely a social organization, any
way."

Counting- cf Straight Ballots.
Registrar Walsh has issued Â«peci3c in
structions to election officers that thera,
most be co sorting of the ballots fcr the
purpose of counting them at the close of
the polls next Tuesday. Under farmer
laws the straight ballets were strung to
gether and counted as such, but under
the Australian ballot law but one ballot
may ' be taken from the ballot be i and
each name voted far thereon most b*
counted and strung before the next bal
lot Is taken from the box. Inspectors of
election are being cautioned to sea that
the law ia this resject U atrtcUy ' ewaÂ»Â»
riled wltX
upon by an applicant for a position In f
the Sheriff's office. The applicant, sap-
posing that the man he was addressing f
was still in the SchmiU fight! said:
-I want you to give me a letter of In-
troduetlon to Mayor. Schmitx- I caa get
a position in the Sheriff's office if Curtis
Is elected, provided I can get the In-1
dorsement of SchmiU and Ruef. because
Curtis got the Union Labor nomination
on a deal to give Ruef half the patron-
age rn the office." !
The man to whoa the request for the â¢
letter was made frankly said that he {
supported Schmitz two years ago, but in
this campaign he was standing In for
M' Crocker. He remarked, however.!
tha't his personal relation with the
Mayor were agreeable, and therefore he
would give the letter of introduction as
desired-
Subsequently the letter was written
and thÂ» annlica"t for a Dosition In the
Mayor Schmitz. The Mayor read the
communication, discussed the political
situation, referred to his own campaign
and remarked that Curtis, having two
nominations, stood a grjod chance of win
ning. The interview ended by the Mayor
giving the applicant a letter to Curtis
and a letter to Ryef. Later on the ap
plieant reported that Ruef and Curtis
told him that everything was all right
and advised him to get out and b-lp.
Curtis-
Ruef and Schmitx are evidently play
ing a cunning political game. The word
*&** Â°Â« passed "along the line" that
Ruef is for Henry H. Lynch, but a Aezl
was made all the same with Curtis and
the Democratic candidate got the nomi

There is no doubt that this satisfactory
state of mind on the part of the "working

the personality of the man who yesterday
went among them as one of them, and as
a man offering them "a square deal and

Henry J. Crocker scored ten miles of
enthusiastic greetings yesterday in one
of the biggest days of his campaign. He
rushed everything before him at>d tamed
up serene and fresh at four meetings at
night. By 10 o'clock in the morning Se
was going through the maze^of buildings
comprising the great: sugar rtrtneries of
the Potrero. To go , through these, ac
cording to the foreman who escorted Mr.
Crocker, means a. walk of at least live
miles. This five miles was Â¦ marked by
many open avowals for Crocker, and the
expressions of good will on all sides as
the candidate extended his hand suggest
ed the fact that never before in the his
tory of city politics has a Republican can
didate met with such hearty expressions
of support and liking in. the section''com
prising the Potrero and South San Fran
cisco, taken as a whole.
"I have never authorized any person to
quote me as preferring Mr. Lane to Hen

have never publicly expressed my pref

both good citizens. My preference will
be expressed on next Tuesday, when I go

and when my party places good men on
the ticket for public offices, everything
being equal, it has been my practice and
it Is my duty to support the ticket. I
know of nothing at the present time that
will cause me to deviate from this rule.
Thi3 Is all I care to say on the subject
just now, further than that I most posi

The Republican compaign committee.

for the party and the people will be won
next Tuesday In the election of Henry J.

The Crocker Rough Riders will form on New Montgomery street, facing Market. In the
column will be the Union League, the Dirigo and the Greater San Francisco clubs, which will
follow immediately the mounted escorts, followed in turn by various clubs, organizations and
friends of candidates. The Bahrs Volunteers and the Lynch Invincibles have informed the mar
shal of their -intention to turn out. To-day friends of other candidates will make known their
wishes to participate. The formation of all these will be announced to-morrow.
It is desired that all clubs, organizations and friends of candidates who desire to partici
pate in this gathering report to Captain R. P. Hurlbut at his offices, Thurlow block, Kearny
street, near Sutter, as soon as possible to-day, that he may assign them their position in the
line.
Mr. Crocker and other candidates will address the people at various points along the

large to accommodate the people, it has been proposed to have outdoor meetings on Satur
day efemng at various points on Market street. .
A ntunber of organizations and friends of Henry J. Crocker and of all the candidates
have tendered escorts to these gentlemen, and in order that there may be some uniformity it has
been deemed best to form all these organizations and friends into divisions and march along
Market street from New Montgomery street to Ninth, going up on the north side of the street
and countermarching on the south side. The head of the column will move at 8 130 o'clock from
the corner of Market and New Montgomery streets under command of R. P. Hurlbut, grand
marshal, and Albert E. Castle, chief of staff.
All organizations and friends of candidates desiring to name aids to the grand marshal

IT is now admitted by the Democracy that it will make
the Presidential race next year a maiden stake and will,
run a colt, not expecting to win, but to make a juvenile
record that will admit him to the track in 1908. With this
view Mr. Carter Harrison, called by his party paper, the
Chicago Chronicle, "the mushy Mayor," will try for the
Presidential nomination next year, with the intention of
making a record in his yearling form that will let him into
the handicap of 1008. But that is Hearst's plan, too, and he
enjoys the advantage of being a member of Congress, and
will be present right. in the political center to put himself in
shape for the race.
Of course the nomination of cither will be a confession
that the party' has no man fit for the Presidency now, but
that it 'as 'opes of having one later on in the century. The
country will not be in sympathy with the proposed colt race,
for it is trifling with a great matter. The people look upon
the Presidency' as too important to be treatedas a kinder
garten affair. Parties arc expected to name for that great
candidacy seasoned and experienced men, whose claims rest
upon their exalted character and their fitness now to deal
with our vast domestic ; interests that converge upon the
executive office,, and with our! international concerns, which
now * are planted -in .every capital and in every part of the

quit chewing its tongue and making strange signs and nomi

fight for him on lines consistent with. fidelity to the consti

Answers to Queries.
THE demand upon our American forests for paper
pulp and railroad ties is alone sufficient to exhaust
them within one lifetime from this date. Each day's
issue of American newspapers requires the destruction of
square, miles of forest. ~The paper-makers have ceased to
explore and experiment with other sources of supply.
The processes for reducing trees to paper arc so perfected
and the reduction is so convenient and so profitable that it
is safe to say that no effort will be made to seek another
supply until this is exhausted.
What is needed is the discovery of something that
makes an annual crop, from which paper may be manu
factured. Trees are a century cropland when destroyed
that source for all present, practical purposes permanently
disappears. If science could take an annual crop, for in
stance the corn stover, the stalks of that plant, and, by
digesting the silicate in them, produce a paper pulp, an
enormous bulk of vegetable matter, now used only for in
different fodder for animals, would be found equal to the
entire. demand for paper, and the corn-growers would add
to the profits of that Crop. But, as far as known, no one
is seeking a substitute for wood pulp. ThÂ« page on which
this is printed was only recently part of a green tree,
growing in the forest, with flowers blooming in its shade
and birds singing in its branches. The transformation is
the work of only a few -hours/
Recently in a German wood pulp factory a test of speed
was made in the conversion of a standing tree into a
printed newspaper. The trees were felled; at 7:35 a. m., the
bark was peeled and the wood sawed into 12-incli cuts,
split, put into the defibrators, whence they issued as pulp,
which was. sent to the vat and passed to the paper machine;
at 9:34 a. m. the roll of paper. was finished. The whole
process from standing tree to paper ready for the press
consumed only one hour and fifty-nine minutes. The paper
roll was carried two and a half miles to a printing office, and
at exactly io o'clock appeared a fully printed newspaper,
making just two hours arid twenty-five minutes from the
tree to a paper ready for the mail! As long as the raw ma
terial is in sight for such rapid reduction it is perhaps use
less to expect a substitute.
American railroads use annually 110,000,000 ties to re
place those that are worn out,, to say nothing of- the de
mands for new constructions There" is no substitute for a
wooden tie. Metal, stone and concrete have been tried,
but they present an unyielding resistance that finally dis
integrates them and is reflected in the wear and breakage
of the metal parts of the cars.
Mr. Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture, is conducting ex
periments to increase the life of railroad ties. His forestry
bureau expects to be able to suggest chemical treatment, at
low cost,, that : will 'double the durability of the wood. As
each year added to the life of ties saves 110,000,000 ties, it
will be seen that the life lease of the timber to supply that
many ties js correspondingly extended. This effort of the
Secretary, reveals the all-round usefulness of scientific for
estry, which is directed to preserving what forests we have,
to planting more* timber, and to increasing the durability
of timber after it has been reduced to economic uses.. ? We
may hope that as a further measure "in the interest of forest
preservation the Secretary of Agriculture may stimulate. the
search for ah annual crop that will take the place of wood
pulp in the production of paper. -

human operators, that a large saying in
line expenses is effected.
The tape which sends the message is
prepared for the transmitter by operators,
many of them young women, who, by
means of a perforating device, punch
holes through narrow paper ribbon. The
holes on one Fide are for the dots and
those on the other side for the dashes
of the Morse alphabet. When the per
forated tape with Its punched message is
ready for the transmitter it has three
lineE of neatly cut holes extending Its en
tire length. The perforations of the out
side lines are spaced irregularly, but the
smaller holes in the center are at regular
intervals, for they "feed" the tape
through the transmitter. The tape, run
ning through the "mill." as the boys call
the sending device, permits litvie pins to
work up through the holes. The pins,
through a system of levers, operate "con
tact points." which open and close the
circuit each time a pin pops Its head
through a hole, and every time a contact
point makes a contact a "pulse qf cur
rent" is sent over the wire. The varia
tion of time intervals between the pulses
make the telegraphic dots, dashes and
spaces.
At the receiving end the Instrument
works the other way. In it the pulses
of current energise electro-magnets which
move an Ink wheel or syphon pen up and
down over a running paper tape, and the
electrical dots and dashes are made visi
ble on the ribbon. Typewriter operators
take thf Inked tape and transcribe the
messages on to ielegraph blanks. This
completes the operation.
Up to the point where the pulses of
current arrive at the receiving end the
Buckingham system is like that just de
scribed, except that a different arrange
ment of dots, dashes and spaces is used.
Every one of the twenty-six letters and
four punctuation characters printed by
the "buck" requires six pulses of cur
rentâthree ncsitU-e and three negative.
When the current pulses arrive at the
â¢â¢buck" they are somewhat weary with
their long journey, but they have enough
animation in reserve to "work" a "relay"
which catches the fatigued pulsations and
sends them forward with renewed life.
This relay Is an electro-magnet, so sensi
tive that even a feeble current is suffi
cient to energize It. As the recurring
electrical pulsations magnetize and de
magnetize the relay its armature moves
back and forth, faithfully reproducing the
dots and dashes arriving from the far end
of the line. The armature operates as
a switch to open and close a strong local
circuit and over this local circuit the pul
sations are led to a glass covered, mys
terious affair, called a "sunflower be
cause it has six little switches or "con
tact points" that radiate from a stem
something like the Petals of the floral
sunburst.
The "sunflower" performs a most Im
portant office-it separates the groups of
current pulses into Individual flashes of
current, literally dissecting each letter
Into its six parts and sending each part
forward as an Independent pulsation.
Suppose the letter A. which in the
Buckingham system Is composed of a
dash followed by two dots (â ---) comes
into the "sunflower."- It has six pulses
of current, one for the dash, two for the
dots, two for the spaces between the
dash and the dots, and the last, or sixth,
for the space following the letter. The
group of pulsations Is split up. each pulse
going to one of the, six contact points.
Each point Is a little switch, connected
electrically with Ha "relay." which in
turn Is in circuit with an electro-mag
net under the printing device.
The pulse of current for -the dash in
the letter A goes to the> particular relay
whose wire, springs, kind of winding,
etc., are so nicely proportioned and ad
justed that only a pulsation of the length
and, character represented by -the dash
will put it In action. On the instant the
armature of the "dash" relay moves a
current flashes around the connecting
electro-magnet In the printing device.
That particular magnet moves a little
ptcel arm. which in turn moves one of a
series of horizontally arranged levers, and
It Is these levers which push forward and
pull backward and turn the type cylin
der.
There are five levers with their five
pairs of electro-magnets In the printing
machine. There are five of the relays
which select their corresponding electro
magnets In the printer. , The order : In
which the first five of . the six pulses of
current for each lettei^ come -over the
wire from the sending â¢ end Â¦ determines
the combination of relays, contact points,
magnets and levers which moves' the type
cylinder forward and twists It around un
til the right letter for that particular
combination Is under the hammer. ...Then
comes the sixth pulseâ always a long one.
It actuates its magnet, the little hammer
flies against the paper, and the dash and
two dots assume tangible form in . the
shape of a purple colored "A on the tele
graph blank. The message "written." It
is slipped from the brass arm and while
the Â¦Â¦Â¦ operator, is sending the completed
message to be copied, etc.. the "buck" is
"writing" another one, the little hammer
tapping the letters out more rapidly than
[the most expert ot human typewriters.'
BT MAIyCOLM McDOWELL..
New 'Automatic Recorder.
It is not our affair, but we express- what many gentlemen
think in saying that Lane's set and thorough repudiation of
his friend McNab is an odious proceeding. It is known to
every politician in the State that McNab was Lane's wet
nurse in politics. He taught the young man the alphabet of
politics, picked him up in his first political panties, led and
nurtured him into knickerbockers and out of them into
long trousers. If ever one man was under obligation to
another Lane owes what he is to McNab. Therefore it is
painful to see him, at the dictation of the Examiner, stand
up and kick his friend in the face and break his political
nose and treat him as a man of such ill repute that associa
tion with him is contaminating. It is a high price to pay
for the office of Mayor, if it were possible for Lane to be
elected. All men know of McNab's sturdy and steady
friendship for the ambitious young man, and all who know
it feel that Mr. Lane has belittled himself by declaring that
the Examiner's" estimate of his friend is correct, and that
he is properly on that paper's blacklist and is a man to be
shunned.
A man of spirit' would not have done this. Mr. Lane
will never be a success in politics, and we fear that this
perfidy to his friend indicates his failure in everything, for it
is the first requisite to success that a man stick to his friends.
He may be mistaken in his estimate of them, but all men re
spect him for fidelity to those who have befriended him!
The politicians are aghast at this latest caper of Mr. Lane.
We have had various bosses and syndicates of bosses in this
city. They have worked politics, and in that work have
done grievous and questionable things. ..They have all de
clined and passed to make room for. others, but in the case
of each his fidelity to his friends is remembered as a virtue
that condoned many vices. It is noticed that even when
Chris Buckley comes to town his walk through the streets
is hindered by citizens, who greet him respectfully. They
know he bossed us with a heavy hand and trod us with a
hard heel, but that is forgotten, and men remember that,
with it all, he was faithful to his friends. It is a virtue that
he shares in common with men who never brought wrath
I upon them by bossing in politics, and is the one touch of
nature in which men who opposed and fought him fellow
ship him now.,
Mr. Lane puts himself in a class superior to Buckley,
but we wish to remark that in this respect of fidelity to a
friend he is Buckley's inferior. McNab is denounced by
the Examiner and blacklisted as a boss, but we know of
I no instance in which he has betrayed, belittled and repu
diated a friend. It is his fault that, as Mr. Lane's school
master, guide, philosopher and friend in politics, he did not
teach him fidelity to friends as the-first essential to success.
Perhaps he took Lane at his own estimate, and when he
appraised himself as a gentleman regarded this quality of
fidelity as a necessary element in that character. But he
pays dearly for assuming that much, for now Lane butchers
him to make an Examiner holiday. -This proceeding makes
Lane a preposterous candidate. It is the bending of his
neck to the Examiner yoke, which even Phelan's political
muscle found a burden too heavy to bear. :
it * R. LANE has furnished the surprise of the cam
/\/\ paign" He. has publicly repudiated and unloaded
1 V 1 M r/ McNab. He states in his unloading- speech
that he has not now never had anything to do with
McNab. To make his repudiation retroactive he declares that
he was under no obligation to McNab for his nomination
to the Governorship, and that he also nominated himself
for Mayor. To further clinch it he shoves his self-adminis
tered purgative still further back and tells the stdryof his
nomination for City Attorney, which he says he secured
by getting pledges of a majority of the delegates his own
self. One part of the whole repudiatory revelation is of
interest, for it makes it perfectly, plain that Mr. Lane did
not wait for any of the offices to which he has been nomi
nated or elected to seek him. He did not shy, side-step nor
run and hide. Quite otherwise. He went out and hunted
the office every time and ran it to cover and caught it, with
out any help from McNab or anybody else. He is the glow
worm of politics, and does not conceal himself, but lights
his lantern and gleams in the political grass to attract the
job which he covets. _ < . .
The Examiner has not only made this repudiation of Mc-
Nab necessary, but it is probably a condition of that paper's
support. In unloading McNab,- and dumping him in the
political go-down as so much chuckage, he loads up with
the Examiner. He has not escaped a boss, but has merejy
traded bosses, and the people, when they vote, must give
careful consideration to the exchange. Every citizen must
make up his mind whether the city government will be
cleaner and more decent if bossed by the Examiner instead
of by Mr. McNab.
Sensational newspapers, in the interest of the scrippers'
raid, have been parading tens of millions of dollars as the
amount involved in the frauds now under examination. But
the Secretary of the Interior says that a comprehensive
examination by experts has resulted in finding that only a
million acres needs to be investigated .for fraud. Such
cases are constantly under examination, and a percentage of
these to which public attention has been recently called are
not of recent origin. The rights of the Government never
lapse, and the statute of limitations does not run against
sovereignty, and these land cases lie for years in the hands
of the fraud division of the General Land Office until they
can be efficiently examined. There is now a proper dispo
sition to clear them up. and the well-known views of the
President upon righteous administration satisfy the people
that he will see to it that the truth is known and the guilty
are punished.
THERE is something suspicious in the effort to inflate
the land frauds into a gigantic measure. The holders
of land scrip have an organized campaign to procure
the repeal of all existing laws by. which public land, may
pass into private' ownership. ... If' this is done the outstanding
land scrip becomes very valuable, since by. its location only
can land, be secured. The best way to procure the repeal
of the land laws is by making the country believe thatthey
are the means of fraud. To this end the preposterous theory
is propagated that when an owner sells land that has been
patented to him that act is evidence that his intentions were
fraudulent! It is known that there are instances of mis
use of the land laws by the employment of dummies to
make the entry and get the patents. But such misuse of the
law. has occurred wherever there was public domain.
The same sensational charges that are made now. were
made in all the older land States. It is undeniable that the
laws may be guarded against misuse, and should be amended
for that purpose:^ It is also proper policy, if feasible,. that
desert and arid lands that, may be irrigated under the Fed
eral law may be withdrawn from entrv. under any of the ex
isting laws and held in reserve for actual settlers when
water is ready for them. This is necessary in order that the
Government may get its money back into the revolving
fund, to be applied again to irrigation works. But in order
to safeguard the laws by wholesome amendment, or to
carry out properly the irrigation policy of the Government,
it is Â¦ entirely unnecessary to lampoon^the whole Western
country and make the Eastern people believe that we are

were able to learn much that will be of
value to them in their respective studios.
The association had its inception In the

LONDON, Oct. 29.â Sir Thomas Lipton
has definitely withdrawn his offer to pre
sent a cup for a trans-Atlantic yacht race
in 1904, and has made way for Emperor
William,"' who 'will present a cup through
the New York Yacht Club or the Atlantic
Yacht Club. The result was attained by;
the following interchange of telegrams: j
From Sir Thomas Lipton to Emperor j
William, October 27:
1 hear . f rcm the Atlantic Yacht Club your
Majesty contemplates offering a cup for a trans-
Atlantic i yacht race in liÂ«u, but that some!
question has arisen on account of a similar of- Â¦
'fer by myseir. In the best Interests of the i
sport of which your Majesty has always been I
an enthusiastic exponent. I am only too willing ;
to ask the consent of the Atlantic Yacht Club
to -withdraw my offer for 1004 and most re
spectfully and heartily tender your Majesty
such support as lies In my power to mane a
trails-Atlantic race for your cup In 1W4 a thor
oughly representative, international event,
which, under your imperial auspices, it could
scarcely fall to be. Iwo trans-Atlantic races 1
the game year would hardly bÂ« satlstttctory to .
the contestants, nor provide an efficient test of I
the highest yachting skill, endurance and work- i
manshtp. X i feel certain that these reasons I
which prompt this offer of withdrawal would
ui>i><al to the authorities or the Atlantic Yacht ;
Club, and that they, jointly with the New York i
Yacht Club officials, would gladly carry out suchj
arrangements as your Majesty might suggen )
and agree with me in desiring to do everything i
possible to show keen appreciation of the gen
erous- Interest* your Majesty has repeatedly ,
tv.n-.-ed In the advancement of yachting in all
countries. , .
Upon receiving your distinguished approval
I will cable to New York a definite withdrawal
of my offer for 1004. THOMAS. J. LIPTON. ,
From Emperor William:
NEW PALACE, Germany, Oct. 23.
Sir Thomas L/pton. LCndon: '
I am most grateful for your kind telegram.
My olfer was not made earlier, as 1 was unable
to find out whether you intended to build for
lSKU. Consequently I feared to disturb your
plans in case you were preparing a new chal
lenge for the America's' cup. I was informed
by my Kmbassador, who will offer my cup to
the two clubs, that a similar offer had been
made by you. I at once resolved to leave It to
the officers of the Atlantic Yacht Club and the
NÂ«-w York Yacht Club to decide which offer
would be acceptable to them, as I fully agree
with you that two trans-Atlantic races In the
satoe year would hardly provide a satisfactory .
sport or results; ! Your resolve to withdraw j
your offer for my Bake has deeply touched me ,
and I hasten' to thank you for your generous
Intention and accept your proposal.
1 was prompted to offer a cup In hopes of en
couraging ocean racing with a view to stimu
latinr designers and builders into producing a
clasa capable of keeping the open sea easily and
combining seaworthiness with safety and com- j
fort, without sacrificing speed, and to develop
a sound type of schooner.
I believe this class of yacht would most ap
peal to those who love the sea and who do not
wish to use their craft exclusively for racing
purposes. -
With your generous withdrawal, you havs
magnanimously tendered your support to make
a race for an Atlantic cup a success, thereby
curving the great cause of yacht racing, the
finest sport In the world, the development of
which I have so much at heart.
Once more my most sincere thanks,
WILLIAM, I. R.

PITTSBURG. Oct. 29.â The verdict of
the Coroner's jury on the death of ex-
City Recorder Owen Brown was reached
t^-night after thirteen sittings. The Jury
found that Brown came to his death sud
denly at his residence on Sunday after
noon. March 15. 1303, from poison admin
istered by some unknown person or per
sons.
. The drath of Recorder Brown occurred
H few days after his resignation as City
Recorder, at the close of a year's bitter
factional fighting in local politics.
There were vague rumors of suicide at
ihe time, but the death was generally at
tributed to collapse from overwork and
mental stress. The suicide rumors, how
ever, reached the ear of J. P. R. Brown
of Nebraska, a brother of the deceased,
and he cam*? here to investigate. On April

IS YOUR STOMACH ON A
STRIKE?
There Is Nothing to Prevent You Em-
ploying a Substitute to Do Its Work, j
There Is such a thing as forbearance I
ceasing to be a virtue, even in the case of j
one's stomach. There is no question but j
that some stomachs will stand . a great j
dear more wear and tear and abuse than :
others, but they all have their limit and ',
when that limit Is reached . the stomach!
rnust' bo reckoned with as sure as fate. I
The btst way and really the only effec- !
tlve -way to treat your stomach when it !
rebels is to employ a substitute to do its .
work. This . will givp the weakened and j
worn-out organ an opportunity to rest and !
regain Its strength and health. I
Stuart's Dyspepsia - Tablets relieve the !
stomach of i its work by j taking up the i
work and doing it just as one set or [
shift of,' workmen relieves another. They !
actually digest the food in just the same j
manner and just the same time as the j
digestive fluids of a sound stomach do. In !
fact, when dissolved In the stomach thpy
are digestive fluids, for they contain
exactly the same constituents and ele-
ments as the gastic juice and other di-
gestive fluids of the stomach. No mat-
ter what the condition of the stomach is, I
their work Is Just the same. They work*
in their own natural way without regard
to surrounding conditions. .
The stomach being thus relieved by
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, . Is restored
and renewed by nature and the rest of
the â¢ human body does not suffer in the
least by -reason of its failure to perform
its work.
;A Wisconsin man says: "I suffered the
pangs of dyspepsia for ten years. I tried
every known remedy with indifferent re-
sults until I was told of the remarkable
cures of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I
bought n box, began taking them and
forgot. I had a stomach. Three, boxes
cured me completely. I have had no trou-
ble whatever for a year and have an ap-
petite like a harvest hand and can eat
anything that is set. before me without
fear of bad results."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for sale
byall druggists at 50 cents a box. The
druggist never falls to have them in stock,
because the demand for them is so great
and Iso pronounced that he cannot afford
to be Y without them. People who ;Â¦ could
not get them of one druggist would go
to ; another and would get in the habit of
buying v their other drugs there as well as
their, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.

STARTS FOR CALIFORNIA
Hundreds of veterans of the Grand
Army of the Republic were the guests
last evening in Pioneer Hall of Seven
Pines Circle of the Ladies of the G. A. R.
The occasion was a camp fire given by the
ladies. After a pleasing entertainment
there was a supper in the banquet hall,
such as used to be served in the army
In the days of the CiVil War. The fea
ture of the supper was baked pork and
beans,* served on tin plates, . with coffee
in tin cups. Pipes and tobacco were pro
vided for those who cared to smoke. In
addition to the "vets" and the ladies of
the circle there were many ladies and
gentlemen who are not members of either
organization, but who always take an
interest in social functions given by them.
For the pleasure of the assemblage there
was presented a programme made up of
the following numbers: 2
Overture, orchestra: address. National Presl-"
dent Mrs. B. S. Bailey: specialties, Ethel and
Arnold Grazer; recitation, "An Order for- &
Picture," Comrade J. H.. Roberts: Occidental
Quartet â First tenor. Harry Dowdell; second
tenor, Fred Keser; first bass, James Lewie;
second bass, Gus Dorn; specialties. Miss May
Pettee: recitation. "St. Peter at tha Gate."
Miss Josephine WaJworth; "The Man Who
Lead* the Band,". Frank Pohl, drum major.
This" very agreeable reminder of the
long ago, which closed with dancing, was

Geary the accused men quickly crossed
over from the opposite side | of Kearny
street and attacked him-
Frank states. that they struck, him sev
eral hard blows in the face ! and when
he had succumbed to their { beating the
pair went through his pockets and robbed
him of $7 30, all he'had. iTrankls badly
beaten about the face, but none of -the
money he is alleged to nave lost was
found in the possession of either, of the

SUMMARY,
The eame was fast and much better
than the talent has been handing, out
during the last few weeks. The Cripples
registered their first tally in the fifth
'round. Devereaux started it with a dou
ble to' the center field fence. The next
two j men did not make good, but Willie
O'Hara shoved one into right and the red
top scampered home. Hogan threw the
ball away at second and O'Hara kept
on going till third was reached. Then
Rockenfield continued the good work by
rapping out one over Egan's head, mak
Â¦ing the second tally for Peter.
Keefe's triple over third, followed by
Hlldebrand's single brought home the
only- Senatorial tally in the eighth. It
might have been more, only. Kruger got
under McLaughlin's drive out to the left
field fence and therefore cut off a triple.
The Cripples opened up again during their
half of the eighth and batted in "two
more. The score:

steered the Cripples to victory again yes
terday afternoon at Recreation Park. In
every Inning the blonde topped left-hander
was the goods and he kept the Senators
away from the rubber till the eighth,
when they managed to squeeze one over
and thus save a shutout. Score, 4 to 1.

Step Around Jurned out a Fad mistake
as one of the choices in the concluding
mile selling affair. She led for three
quarters of the route and then sent her
regrets. The winner turned up in Erne, a
4 to 1 outsider, which led Marelio, the fa
vorite, over the mark with something to
give away. F. E. MULHOLLAND.
If any account whatever Fox Lake
looked a good 4 to 5 chance for the six
furlong run, next decided. The ring laid 1
8 to 6 about the two-year-old and he
won, but it proved no lay down. Big Bill
Knapp waited on Dollie Welthoff and
Nona B to the stretch, where he picked
up the running, and, in a driving finish,
downed Our Pride half a length. Ultruda
ran third and should have been first.
It looked as If Frank Pearce might have
been the compromise candidate in the
seven furlong selection. He was well
played and won all the way. Iraa, in a
drive, downed Adrea a head for place
honors. Waterbury, astride Dr. "Worth,
made a bad mess of it.
Chandler had the mount on Roltaire in
the flve-f urlong scramble following,' lit
tle Lewis not being considered persuasive
enough. The Texas-bred trick ruled a
3 to 5 favorite, and, leading from the
Jump, was all out at the wire to beat Isa
belllta half a length. Ismad, at 6 to Li
displayed more speed to-day, ending up a
good third.
LOS ANGBUES, Oct. 29.â A threadbare
card, entirely,- f eatureleets, attracted only
an ordlnary-Blzed crowd to the track this
afternoon and 'the betting was dull and
listless. , Roltaire, Fox Lake and Frank
Pearce were thÂ© winning, favorites. Five
heats were necessary to decide the 2:17
trot, which finally went to Mamie Eliza
beth, driven by Walter Maben. Lady
Zombro, the favorite, with two heats to
her credit, lost the fifth and deciding one
by a narrow margin.
Lady Lusk, with L Spencer up, and
Flea, ridden . by Hilderbrand, fought It
out in the first running event, a four and
a half furlong run for two-year-olds.
Flea at first had the footing over the
filly, but she passed him in the run home,
receiving a nose decision.- Lady Belair
was third. El Corteza, from the Baldwin
stable, opened an odds-on choice, re
ceded to even money and ran back in the
ruck. . . ,

AQUEDUCT, Oct. 29.â Hermis, winner
of the Brighton Cup, attested his versa
tility to-day by winning the Edgemere
stakes at nine furlongs in 1:53. which
.lowered the truck record try one second.
The nine furlones of to-day were run
wi^h only one turn, whereas the previous
holder of the record. Articulate (now
dead), ran his race with two turns, one
of which was very sharpâ that at the
paddock end.
At one time to-day Stolen Moments ap
peared to have Hermis coing his best
and the performance of this filly, follow
ing so closely on the heets of her hard
race on Tuesday, reveals that she is a
.g-ocxl one. though very unlucky in several
of her etarts.

Notwithstanding the 'active, effort*, of *he

have 'come forward during the last year.
; And the woman, carried away by sheer
admiration for her ,' audacity, gave her a
quarter.â New York Times.
"I'm not so sensitive as some folks "
she said. "I don't mind if people do con
sider me a servant." ,
"When the work was at last finished the
girl braced back and looked at the woman
steadily. 'Â£$%& â¢
"I think it strange," she . said, "that
self-respecting people who have a good
position should so demean themselves as
to accept, contributions from strangers in
that way.' If the people for whom I work
should offer to tip me every time I drew
an extra breath I should feel insulted. I
should imagine that they considered me
a mere servant."
, Employes in various lines, of business
who are out for tips are not easily in
sulted by chance or premeditated re
marks of the people from whom the tips
necessarily come. One woman who has
had her pocket book drained and her soul
tortured by the insidious but persistent
demands of such attendants had that fact
impressed upon her early In the week.
She was a visitor in an up-town mani
cure* rarlor. She had been. there several
times before, and each time had courage
ously gone away. without paying anything
in excess of the regular taxation/ On the
occasion of her latest visit the girl who
took charge of her hands adroitly intro

EMPORIA. Kans., Oct. 23.â A warrant
was Issued to-night for the arrest of W.
C. Ilette Santa Fe agent at tfiJs place,
charging him with discharging from tne
employ of the road Leigh Petit, a mem
ber of the local Kansas National Guard
company, because he left his work to at
tend the maneuvers at Fort Rlley. Petit
was ordered with his company to the
maneuvers and claims he was told by
Ilette that if he went he could consider
himself discharged. Ilette says he had
decided to dispense with Petlt's services
before he heard of the maneuvers. A test
case will be made of the matter.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 23. â Another change In
the hsad of the local office of the United States
Engineers' Department has been ordered by the
Government. Major J. H. Wlilard, who cam*
here last June to saccesd Captain Edgar Jad
wln. has been ordered to Newport. It. I., and
Charles H. McKlnrtry. lately stationed at thÂ«
Washington Barracks. Is to be placed In ehargo
here.
Mr. Roath says that since 1SS3, when
he retired from active life, he has travel
ed over much of the continent. His home
has been in the summers in Norwich and
in the winters in Chicago and In a sani
tarium in Michigan. â N. Y. Commercial.
Like that character of fiction, Mr.
Roath has been found to be fond of giv
ing Bound, homely advice.
"JLet me give you one piece of advice.
young man," he said to a caller. "Don't
invest in anything you can't eat. People
must eat always, but in hard times they
doii't put up big buildings, and they don't
buy any luxuries. .Don't borrow money.
I know a man who was worth $6,000,000.
He wasn't satisfied and borrowed as much
more to be used in speculation. In the
panic of 1573 that man was Just wiped
out.
"I have saved money every year of my
life since I began working here in a gen
eral store for $6 a month," the old man
said, in a brief review of his business
career. "A young man, to succeed, must
do that. Then I put the little I had saved
out at interest."
He told how he commenced life in Chi
cago in 1S33.
"It is true I had exceptional opportun
ities. Chicago, when I went there, had
SOOO people, and now it has 2,000,000. But
opportunities are to be found anywhere,
and at the present time."
-Many eccentricities of the old man are
told. It is known that he would haggle
with a hackman in Norwich, and would
refuse to pay more than a quarter for a
ride. In his trips to other cities, which
he has visited often in the years of his
leisure, he always put up at the dollar a
day hotels and quarreled with bootblacks
and barbers if he thought they over
charged him.
That the cash will be thrown away no
one in Norwich expects. The relatives are
frugal and industrious, and have never
been dependents, as they have never been
spendthrifts. They, in common with the
other residents of the New England city,
have not yet recovered from the shock
given them by the sudden revelation of
the true character of Mr. Roath. All
his life he was regarded as a close, im
penetrable money getter. No one knows
how to take him now. He is David
Harum outdone, they say, and they can
not venture any further. -
"I got it all fixed." he chuckled to him
self, discussing the matter, "and then I
sprung it on them. Now I'll wait around
and see what they do with it. Yes, I
gave it to them without a single reser
vation. They can throw it away if they
want to. I'll Just wait and see."
Stories are still coming from Norwich.
Conn., of the ways of Stephen B. Roath
of Chicago, who last week distributed
$1,000,000 among his relatives. Mr. Roath's
personality has been the subject of many
character sketches, and there is much
speculation as to what use the recipients
of his gifts will make of their money.
Mr. Roath is depicted as sitting on the
porch of the home of his sister, Mrs. Ma
thilda Randall, enjoying the prospect of
seeing how his relatives, formerly poor,
be*have themselves in their new affluence.
Hitherto Regarded as a Close-Fisted
Money-Getter Gives Away a

ECCENTRIC CONDUCT
OF NORWICH TVrrTTJONATRE
Seiger ran up some ten pounds in weight
during the let up in hfs training. This
must all come off. so he has settled down
to his work again in earnest.
It is claimed Jeffries woald beat down
Johnson's guard quickly and would soon
nave him at his mercy. Although John
son beat McVey the boxing men believe
the latter would give the champion a
harder argument than would Johnson.
The Yosemlte Club officials will pull
all thÂ« wires in an attempt to secure the
leading heavy-weights for a championship
bout early in the new year.
George Gardner has secured Harry
Foley as a sparring partner and has
settled down to hard training at a Marln
County resort. Fitzsimmona Is training
at Croll's gardens. Alameda. but he has
been unable to secure a boxing partner
Sam Berjjer is anxious to be restored to
amateur standing and will not jeopardize
his chances by assisting Fltz-immona
Jimmy Britt is back at Croll's. His in
jured foot is not giving h:m any trouble.
Britt's recent training has all tended
toward the development of speed in box
ing, which seems a mistake, as it is hi3
hitting power upon which he must rely
for victory. It Is the man with the punch
who has been bringing home the money
in the recent fights.
The Colma Athletic Club is first in the
fle-ld for a match between Jeffries and
Jack Johnson. It can go any number of
rounds. An offer has been made of a
CO.OOO purse or 73 per cent of the gate
receipts. The new pavilion of the club
will seat 5000 people and the managers
estimate an average price of $10 per head.
of the boxing experts figure that
Johnson has a chance against JeKrles al
though they all concede he is a careful
boxer, who never takes a chance. Host
or the men of his race are witling. to let
well enough alone. If they obtain a lea.l
they do not rush In and risk receiving a
wild swing, but take matters easy, being
sure of the outcome.

Herrera. the lightweight pugilist, to-night
knocked out Eddie Santry of Chicago la
the thirteenth round of what was to have
been a twenty-round go.
Herrera was the favorite In the bet
ting during the first five rounds, when
Santry's backers offered odds on their
man. with few takers. Santry had all tha
best of the fight up to the last round,
breaking through the Mexican's peculiar
guard as no other fighter has been able
to do. Santry fprced the fighting through
out and was plainly Herrera's superior in
science, but seemed unable to deliver a
knockout blow. While mixing it flercely
ln the thirteenth round Santry received a
terrific short-arm Jolt behind the ear and
went down and out.

STEAMSHIP SINKS
AFTER COLLISION
The new conductor comes from a mu
sical family. His grandfather and his
father were both talented musicians and
composers and two of his brothers
are distinguished musicians. Another
brother is a high Government official and
a wonderful linguist.
Chiaffarelli Is liked by the members of
the band because of his quiet, unassum
ing manner. He is very much wrapped
up in bis work and is a great student.
He Is also a composer of rare ability and
one of bis compositions will be played by
the band in 'this city.- He is possessed
of great talent as a musician and can
play nearly every musical instrument.
CHIAFFARELLI, the new leader
of the famous Royal Italian
Band, soon to be heard in this
city, is said to Be one of the
most modest of leaders, and his
style is entirely different from that of a
great many of the famous conductors
now before the public He has made a
good impression in every city where the
band has played and the public of this
city will surely be charmed with his
style.
The unfinished tieadgear is now ready ;
for the pressing room, where It Is put un- ;
der pressure on machines, which process
gives Jt an even finish. In the â¢ pressing '
room there are twelve hydraulic presses
and twenty-six steam presses. Hats that j
require a smooth, finish are placed under j
hydraulic presses, and when the rough ef- I
fects are wanted the hats are placed un- '
der the eteam machines. The work cf j
blocking and pressing Is all done by men.
The metal dies or patterns used in the
blocking and pressing, are also made j In
the molding or block shop in the base
ment.
The next step is to give the hats a light
coat of varnish to brighten them. The I
hats are then wired and lined. After this I
Is done, and if the factory is not going to j
put on trimmings, they are ready for the
marketâ for the milliners. However, this
factory does Its own millinery work . on
many of the hats, so the, headgear to be
thus treated is sent to the trimming de
partment, where tailor-made effects : are
addedâ that Is. the decorations of . silks,
quills, cords, Â«tcâ Washington Star.
From this department the hats go to
the sizing room, where they are stiffened
with a preparation of glue. They then go
to the hat room, where they are dried
out. While the hats are In the chapes of
the style desired, they must pas3 through
several other stages of preparation before
they obtain a perfect and lasting shape.
For Instance, in the blocking room they
must be blocked on blocks that are heat
ed by steam or gas.
FINISHING TIP.
The sewing machines In use are not the
ordinary kind, but are more complicated
and costly. Each runs iOOO revolutions a
minute, a stitch to every revolution, and
the stitches are a good Imitation of the
hand-made stitch.
From the dyeing department the braid
ed straw is taken to the stockroom.
where It is stored In large boxes and riles
awaiting use as needed. The next step in
hat making Is to sew the straw togrther
into the shapes desired. This work is
dene in the sewing department, an im
mense room la which 20") or more women
preside at as many sewing machines.
They also do much of the finer work by
hand sewing. The straw is sewed Into
the shape desired by patterning the hat
after blocks of plaster cf parts made into
the form of the style desired. These
blocks are made in the molding depart
ment in the basement of the building. In
cidentally It should be stated that the
styles for women's hats nearly all come
from. Paris.
SEWED BY HAND.
The Cleveland factory does a great deal*
of this Importing itself and buys also ;
from the big importers In New York. For â¢
the ppring hats over 100 different styles ]
of braids are used. The braided straw ;
comes In Ira natural color, and the first
step in the process of â¢ manufacture Is f
when it Is sent to the dyeing department, \
where It Is colored black, white, brown j
cr whatever color Is desired.
As far back as last October this factory
began to make spring and eummer hats
for women and the work of turning out
such hats will continue until next June.
Then in July the work of making hats
for fall and winter wear will be begun,
and will continue until the following Oc
tober. All kinds of hats are made, straw,
felt. bÂ«aver, plush and velvet.
The braided cr plaited straw from which
the hats are made Is Imported . from
Japan. Italy, Switzerland, France* and
Germany la the shape of long and nar
row 6trips an inch or more wide. The
most of this material comes from Japan,
for the Japanese have made great strides
in making excellent braids of straw. The
straw cf Japan is of fine quality, durable,
clean and bright and cf light weight. The
chip braids made from trees also come
from Japan.
Then, too, tne fact that each hat while
in the process of manufacture passes
through many hands. Including the vulgar
hands cf men, and is glued, varnished,
steamed, blocked and subjected to treat
ment at many machines, is not nice to
think about. But the plain truth Is that
all women's hats are machine made, and
the majority of them are even fully
trimmed, ready for wear, in the factory.
To supply the feminine demani for
headgear many big factories in this coun
try are in operation all the time and give
employment to many thousands of women
and men. One of the largest of such fac
tories in the country is located in Cleve
land. Its output is from 400 to 500 dozen
finished hats per day during the busy sea
son of eight months in the year.
SWITCHING THE SEASONS.
Few women kne-w how their hats are
made. The majority of the sex. when in
the millinery store selecting a new hat,
probably unconsciously think that the
beautiful hats that they see there are the
particular creations of that store, and lit
tle realise that all these hats â at least
their bodies â are factory made. \ No doubt
the feminine mind would rather not know
this, for it does seem kind of plebeian and
vulgar to think that such pretty head
gear is factory made, that the hats are
made bv machinery and hand work com
bined.

Naval oflJcers and navy men in general

paragraph which was sent all over tie
country a short time ago to the effect
that the Navy Department has it in con
templation to "substitute pajamas for
night shirts" for the use of the enlisted
men In the* United States navy.
The nub of their fun Is the night shirt

enlisted man in the navy ever did, and it
is virtually a 100 to 1 proposition that no
enlisted man in the^ navy ever will, wear

The Oregon was out ninety days from
Newcastle and brought .2000 tons of coal
for the local trade. A French bark was
passed in latitude 37.59 north. longitude
130 west, but her signals could not be de
ciphered.
SAIXOBS LAT7GH AT
IDEA OF PAJAMAS
"We had calms and light winds
throughout the passage and nothing out
of the ordinary occurred until September
12, when we were in latitude 15.43 south,
longitude 152.06 west. There was a moder
ate breeze from the north when the sin
gular phenomenon occurred two miles
astern of the ship. The water was rush
ing and foaming up to an astonishing
height. It crossed the -wake of the ship
and we could see" the water rushing up
to the clouds in a spiral column- about
six feet in diameter.. At the base it looked
like heavy breakers about a mile around.
It finally disappeared to the westward.
If it had passed over the ship it would
have torn the masts and yards out of her
and finally swamped the vessel. It was
seen by all of the hands."
It is regarded as providential by the of
ficers and crew of the bark Oregon, which
arrived here yesterday afternoon with a
cargo of coal from Newcastle. N. S. W.,
that the vessel and all hands are not now
resting -in the unfathomed depths of the
Pacific. The vessel, while in latitude 15.43
south, longitude 152.06 west, on September
12, narrowly missed a colossal waterspout,
which, according to the master's report,
was of such gigantic proportions that the
pinnacle, like Jack's famous beanstalk,
was lost to sight in the clouds.
Captain F. O. Parker's narrative of the
wondrous affair Is as follows:
The jackles turn Into their hammocks in
their Government-straight navy blue un
derwear, and when they're prodded out
of their hammocks, on sudden ship's calls
or on sudden calls to watch, all they've
got to do is to slip on their bell-bottoms
and their shoes â an operation requiring
about forty seconds â and there they are!

Samuel's fleet of frigates? Ask them.'â
Washington Star.
jumping into their uniforms in crder to
report in proper cniform. rig at their fire

Then, agaig? It would be something
highly hilarious to see an old shellback
of thirty years' service, a man who had
been up and down in the world in men-o'
war ever since the days of his apprentice
ship, crawling out of his hammock In a
nightshirt when poked awake and notified
that It was time for him to> prepare to
stand watch, alow or aloft! The very
suggestion of such a thing would make a
sailorman attached to Uncle Sam's line
of packets shake to the center of his mld
â¢ riff with laughter.
Nor Is there the slightest probability
that the bluejackets of the United States
navy will ever wear pajamas, either.
Even if the pajamas are dished out to
the flatfeet by the paymaster's jack-cf
tfae-dust. that won't make the sailors
wear the things. The pajamas would
have to be doffed by all hands at a sud
den call to quarters In the middle of the
night, or when the regular watches were
turned out of the swinging bags, and
when a man-o'-war's man gets piped out
of his hammock he hasn't got any time
to slide out of a cute little suit of pa- Â¦
jamas, roll them up and stow them in
dittybag or locker. By the time he got
through with such an operation as that
he would unquestionably be yanked to
the mast by the master at arms and hot
footed into the ship's brig or punished,
at any rate., with extra duty, for dilatort
ness.

ITEMS OF INTF-REST.
The solos of Franko, the concert meis
ter, occasioned a regular furor. He was
obliged to substitute for the set opening
number the "Air Russe," by Wleniowskl.
which with variations brought out an ex
hibition of remarkable technique and also
showed the artistic side of Franko. To
satisfy the audience he was compelled to
play the "Prize Song" from the "Meis
tersinger," and the Moskowski "Sere
nata." Franko also played an obligato to
the "Prelude du Deluge" very cleverly.
When all the other entertainments in
the city were out the Duss orchestra was
still playing and -the audience was ener
getically applauding. This, considering
that an orchestral concert was the at
traction, tells the full story of success.
This afternoon Nordica and Franko and
the orchestra will be heard.
The soloists were Mrs. Katherine Fisk
and Franko. Mrs. Fisk's first song was
an aria by Saint-Saens from "Samson
and Delilah." This took so well that two
other songs followed as encore pieces,
not ambitious in scope, but excellently
adapted to fall easily within Mrs. Fisk's
register and to give scope to sympathetic
expression and daintiness- Later she

made her best success of the evening by
giving the old ballad "My Love Js Like a

ready mentioned and the "William Tell"
overture and some other pieces as en
cores. "William Tell," as explained by
the accommodating Conductor Duss, was
inserted by request. Whoever proffered
the request made no mistake, for the
overture went off all right, tinged with
all the colors that Its scope admit of. The
orchestral work was good all the even-
Ing, splendidly so in an accompaniment
to a violin solo by Franko. If it was not
always an ardent appeal to the emotions
it was always scholarly and technically
perfect, sane and completely balanced.
MBS. FISK POPULAB.
The "Rienzl" overture led the way
auspiciously. Then followed the sym
phonic po*?m, "Don Juan." by Richard
Strauss. This is not a composition to
awaken very deÂ«p emotion, but it ,Js the
work of a virtuoso and has tonal variety
and grace of movement that, with clever
orchestration, entitled It to the rapt at
tention that it received. The other or
chestral numbers were the "Dream Pan

reflectively treated; the "Rhapsodie Hon

MUSIC THAT WON.
The certainty that every player would
follow the baton; that every orchestral
tone would be pure and unmixed; that,
in a word, every individual man and the
woman who maniculated the harp would
play artistically, with perfect regard and
respect for ensemble, made It only a
question of selection In deciding what the
audience would like.
The particular thing about the Duss
orchestral concert In the Alhambra last
evening was that It was' completely tip
to-date. Nothing on the programme an
tedated the "Rienzf* overture by Wag
ner.' Salnt-Saena was represented In the
prepared musical offerings twice; Rich
ard Wagner twice; Humperdinck, Rich
ard Strauss, Goring Thomas and Waller
once each. The name of Waller may not
at once attract the full apprehension of
the reader, but he figures as the com
poser of the "Dance of the Sunfeast,"
a humorons, semi-musical tone picture
of a pow-wow of American Indians of
some indeflnltely indicated trlbÂ«. With

generation or so with preliminary mock
and the most raggy of all
ragtimes syncopating the drums and
some other . instruments amazingly to
their too notch speed later on.
When the fact is mentioned that all the
music was essentially modern the next
statement due is that the orchestra
cohered as solidly and scintillated as
certainly as a block of ice. That is not
to say that it was coldâ far from that;
but that it had an unmistakable oneness
and sympathetic glitter that ran all the
gamut from the concert meister and his
singing violin down to the nethermost
depths of the double bass and the bell
mouthed tuba, taking in. on the way, the
trumpets that cut the air as keenly as a
razor, on occasion.

The Supervisors' Street Committee yes
terday reported in favor of. referring 'to
the Finance Committee the petition of
the Southern Heights Improvement Club
that a fire engine house be erected on
Twentieth street, near Missouri, together
with the^ necessary apparatus,, with the
recommendation that an .appropriation
for the purpose be made in next year's
budsec.
The committee rescinded Â¦ the resolution
granting a permit to J. H. McKay to
maintain a boiler on Clement street, near
Fifteenth avenue, in response to a pro
test of the Point Lobos Improvement
Club,
minutes later than at Fort Point; the height
of tide is the same at both places. '
BETTER FIRE PROTECTION.
The committee again postponed action
on the petition of the Western Paciflc
Company for a franchise along Sixteenth
street, from Kansas to the water front. :
The committee thereupon notified Gray
Bros, that in future if they exploded any
more blasts on Telegraph Hill without
making application for a permit it would
rtcommend the passage of -an- ordinance
prohibiting rock crushing and quarrying
in that locality.- George Gray said that
if removing rock is quarrying It would
prevent building operations, as it would
be impossible to grade property.
- The Santa Fe and Southern . Paciflc
companies were notified to appear at
next Thursday's meeting to answer the
complaint of the City Front Federation
as to the alleged impassable condition of
Sixteenth street, between Kentucky ajid
Illinois, owing to constant 'traffic on
fourteen tracks. .
The Supervisors' Street Committee yes
terday concluded the investigation Into
the alleged violation of the 'ordinance pro
hibiting blasting by Gray .Bros, on Â¦ Tel
egraph .Hill. A number of property own
ers repeated their previous evidence that
blasting had been done oh September 28
and October 8. They claimed that. Gray
Bros, had broken faith with the Board of
Supervisors, as they had promised not, to
blast on Telegraph Hill In return for be
ing permitted /to operate their rock crush
ing machine.
Gray Bros, contended that they had
kept their promise and had not exploded
blasts on the hill. They had a contract
to grade property on Lombard street in
preparation for the foundation of the
Merchants' " Ice Company building. Ed
Roman, foreman for Gray Bros., admitted
that he had exploded some powder to
break boulders loose. ' â¢
Supervisors' Street Committee Noti
fies Gray Bros, to Cease Alleged
Violation of Ordinance.'
MUST STOP BLASTING
ON TELEGRAPH HILL
The ordinance will be redrafted in or
der to encompass its sole design to let
the public know if a preservative is U3ed
in foods. Its provisions will therefore not
apply to medicines or other compounds
to cure disease.
D'Ancona agrees with the < . druggists
who characterized the ordinance "as ob
noxious, inasmuch as* it would '" compel
them, to divulge the secrets; of. the trad 1 '*.
A committee of druggist3 urged "Mayor
Schmitz to veto the ordinance, but this
will not be necessary, in view of the fact
that the Board of Supervisors ' will re
scind its action in passing' the ordinance
to print.
Supervisor D'Ancona, chairman of the
Health and Hospital Committee of tfie
Board of Supervisors, sent' a communica
tion to Mayor Schmitz yesterday request
ing: him to withhold his signature irom
the ordinance requiring the names of the
ingredients of all foods intended for. hu
man consumption to be placed on the
package containing them, in order that
the board may withdraw the ordinance
and repeal its passage.
D'Ancona stated', in his communication
that the ordinance was introduced
through a misunderstanding and was not
designed to compel manufacturers of pct
ent and other medicine? to print ' the
formulae of the compounds on the pack
age. The only Intent of. the . ordinance
was to require the name of any preserva
tive used in foods to be nut on the labels.
D'Ancona Asks Mayor l to
Withhold Signature Un
til Next Monday.

' Many of California's stage lines are in
dependent and 'would suffer if the Rail
road Commissioners exercised control over
them. A large number of the lines are in
a. combination, however, and experience
has demonstrated that where corporations
are of considerable size it is not detri
Â¦mental to them to be controlled by a
State board.
At present county and town authorities
handle the work which the State board
desires to assume. Attorney General
"Webb has not yet taken the matter un
der consideration, but expects to get ! to
it within a week or two.
The law on the subject Is somewhat in
definite. The Beard of Railroad Commis
sioners is. empowered to regulate tariffs
on State transportation lines. Stages in
the country occupy a position correspond
ing to that of the railroads in the more
thickly populated districts. Hence it is
argued that the board has a right to is
sue its mandates to the stage companies.
The corporations have not yet learned
that the Commissioners are preparing for
an attack, but legal battles may be ex
pected if the board attempts to carry out
its plans. If Attorney General Webb de
cides that the commission Is legally jus
tified in assuming jurisdiction over the
etage lines, the State officials will lmme
diatf-ly take action accordingly.
The State Beard of Railroad Commli
eioners is attempting to secure jurisdic
tion over ail the stage lines In California,
â¢A move to this end was made recently by
requesting an opinion on the subject from
Attorney General Wetib. The question
has never before been raised.
The commission cites constitutional pro
vjslons tending to show that its position
is correct. The various stage lines of the
State are valued at hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
Important Matter Referred
to State Attorney
General.
Bailroad Commission Is
Preparing for a
Battle.

j of any prominence being the larger receipts at
| Minneapolis, with predictions of still further
i Increased ..arrivals. Opening prices were about
*teady. December being unchanged to V&c lower
at SO*i@SO%c. but with lower prices in all
outvfde market* and continued fine weather
!^hÂ«Â»re was much selling: early of the December
{ option, and the markVt started on a downward
course. Trading was quiet with the 'fjreater
portion of the business of a scalping nature.
ThÂ» fact that the "deal" still existed at St.
IxhiI.s. restricted speculation and helped keep
down " price*. After December had reached
"$â¢â¢*<.â¢ toward the middle of the sesslf.n a sll^lu
tally was experienced, due mainly, to reports
of a fair fhlnDln* dÂ«mand, and December
I closed at SO^ig'SO'ic, a loan or J ,*fHÂ»<\
Corn was Uecidedlj' quiet the entire session
and a weak tone prevailed. No special effort
was made to renew the bull enthusiasm of
Â¦ yesterday, the continued fine weather having
i a bearish Influence en traders. December
closed *se lower at 43?ie.
About the only feature in the trading in
rats was aotne buying of the May delivery by
local traders, but the demand was not sufficient
to prevent a decline In prices along with other
grain*. Outside of this business trading was
very small. Decembrc. closed off >ic at 3&\
Provisions shared with eralns the extreme
dullness, but, considering the surroundings, the
market httd firm. Ix>cal packers and scalpers
were on th'' buying side and cauced a email ad
vance In prices in smite of a decline at the
yards. January pork closed 3c higher, lard was
up 7 l ic and rib? a s^ade higher. , . '

Of course you haven't felt the thrill yet, for the new "whizzers" have
not yet reached San Francisco. But they are comingâ coming fast now
â and next week the town will be full of them. And if vou don't know
what a "whizzer" is like it is a foregone conclusion that you will buy the
next Sunday Call, which willprint two full pages telling you all about
themâ where they come from, why they are here and where the> are
going and, best of all, what keeps them always in such a tremendous
hurry, and why they sing so as they go. Indeed the new "whizzers"
will simply fascinate you.
Almost as remarkable as the "whizzers" is the new artillery drill now
performed by Uncle Sam's boys in blue stationed in the West. Just
think of seeing a battery of light-artillery go clattering and bumping
over the ruts of a stubble field and after careening madly around a shock
of new-mown hay come into action, shoot holes into a dense fog and
knock into the kneeling figure of a man four miles awav.
which they could not see by a good two miles. And yet it is not so much
what they do as the way they accomplish such remarkable shots that
makes the new, field drill truly wonderful. Just see the pictures in the
next Sunday Call.
And still there is more to interest you. For instance, there is the
third installment. of the "Golden Fetich," which tells vou more of the
Africa of to-day than has been revealed by any explorer since the great
Stanley gave his discoveries to the world. Then there is "The Cough in
Lower Seven," by Frank H. Spearman, which is as fascinatingly myste
rious as the title itself, and â but of course you know what excellent
railroad stories" Spearman writes. Then there are the "Me-ows of a
Kitty," clever, witty, charming little bits that you will quote to all vour
friends â and yojur lover. And the "Drawing-room Gowns for Winter";
and the beautiful "Child ModeL" (This is a full-page picture that will
make the same strange appeal to you that it does to everyone else who
has seen it.)
Butâ and here is genuine news for you â do you know about the big
golden jubilee of the Catholic Church that will be celebrated in this
city next Sunday. It will be one of the most notable events in all the
history of the church in this State. This article has been written
specially and exclusively for the Sunday Call.
*1 AVE you ever seen the new "whizzers" and felt the almost mad-
Lâ \ deninjr thrB^of seeing them ko flying by like meteors? The
X'- I sensation is strange beyond description, as strange as the new
%y "whizzers" themselves.' which are monsters of the most freakish
sort â monsters the like of which never were seen before. And how they
sing as they go! And with what terrific speed they cleave the air! Just
think of annihilating distance at the rate of less than a mile a minute!
That is how the "whizzers" go. Long, lean and low like a gray wolf
some of them are, while other's speed on their way like ghostly wraiths â
but with such catapult swiftness that the senses are first bewildered and
then intoxicated. It is a sensation that nobody ever escapes. If you do
you will be as superhuman as the new "whizzers" themselves.

Bechtel was a single man, 30 years of
age. He was a laborer and had been a
policeman. He had been a hard drinker,
and when intoxicated was easilyarigered
and prone to fight
The funeral of the murdered girl took
place this afternoon, the services being
held at her late home. As the girl lay
In her coffin her appearance told its own
story. Both eyes were discolered, as
though they had been struck with a
clenched nst. There was a big bruise on
the nose and several smaller ones on the
cheek and ear. The. worst injury, that
on the forehead, was hidden by the hair.
On a flnger was the engagement ring
given to her by Alfred Eckstein.
The suicide of Thomas Bechtel was
followed by the police officials telling
the story of the murder of Miss Bechtel,
as gathered by them. It starts with last
Thursday, when Eckstein > accompanied
Miss Bechtel to Philadelphia. He left
her there and returned. "Weisenberg met
her in Philadelphia and accompanied her
to Allentown. They were together until
midnight. Thomas Bechtel heard of this,
and, being opposed ' to Weisenberg, he
met the girl on her return. He struck
her a powerful blow on the cheek, caus
ing her to fall against a bureau^dead.
Members of the family held a' council
and decided upon the story made public
on Tuesday and upon the disposal of the
body and clothing as found. Charles
Bechtel later used a hatchet in striking
the girl, to give semblance to the story.
This .occurred . immediately after mid
night The body was concealed in the
home until Monday night, when - it. was
placed in the area way. w,here it was
found on Tuesday morning.
Eckstein knew nothing of the murder,
the police say..
AL.L.ENTOWN, Pa.. Oct. 29. â Thomas

With Schrcycr's Marvelous Picture
"FLEEING FROM THE FLAMES"
"FLEEING FROM THE FLAMES."
A wild, unreasoning panic often seizes upon men in the presence of
danger, or even when danger is only imagined. Among the lower ani-
mals the greater the intelligence they possess the more they are sub-
ject to terror. It is said that elephants tremble at the sight of a mouse,
and horses, which are credited with more intelligence than most domes-
tic animals, show more fear.
In the picture of Adolph Schreyer, reproduced in The Call art sup-
plement, there is vividly depicted a stampede of terror - stricken horses
from a burning stable. In their blind gallop into the darkness' they have
crashed into a barrier and are plunging and struggling in "confusion,
some entangled in the splintered wood, while others crowd upon them. It . .' .
Pis a scene which gave the artist abundant opportunity for dramatic effect
and vigorous action. He has also displayed his ability as a/colorist. In
its variety and richness of color the greatest merit lies, . and its color
makes this picture one of the artist's masterpieces. . : i .
Bomantic tendencies are strong in all of Schreyer's painting, and
sentiment, color and effect were more important to him . than accurate
draftsmanship. He possessed the power to express strongly what he felt
more than the ability to depict truthfully what he saw.
"Fleeing From the Flames" is owned by the Chicago Art Institute,
and is included in the splendid collection bequeathed to the museum by
the late Albert A. Munger iiv 1898. - .. " .
Reproduction of one other picture by the same artist, "The Arab
. -. â¢ ... , scout," -has been issued by The Sunday Call, and biographical notes
have been published. : "';vi*

Dear Charley :f I expect to do something that
the world -looks on as a crime and ask you to
be -In at. the finish. ..The last time you saw me
that sore on my face seemed to be well; since
then it has broken out again and is larger than
ever.: and a month a?o I was taken clck with
stomach trouble and have not been able to go. to
work yet. and: I think there,. is a sore In my
stomach thf same as on my face. So I have
made. up my mind to end tt all. I intend to go
to the city to do It, and if successful want you
when my^body ]s found to turn it over to an
undertaker and have it cremated at as little
expense as possible. I will inclose a money or
der to. you which I hope will . cover the cost.
Now. Charley. Â¦> look on it as I do. I don't see
anything before me but misery, but the sooner
It is" ended the better. I have written to my
sister and Mrs. Church." I don't do it here, as
there is no man in the Church family to attend
to it. and we have always been such goud
friends I thought I. could count on yon to fin
ish me up. Bid .the " family good-by, for me.
Good-by and success to you 'in all your under

Rather than suffer a lingering death
from cancer Andrew W. Harvey, a post
offlce mail clerk of San Jose, took "the
open door" of. the Stoic philosophers and
voluntarily ' went out of life. His dead
body with a bullet" wound In the right
temple was found yesterday morning by
Policeman James Foley in the shrubbery
north of the buffalo paddock and south
of the aviary of Golden Gate Park. A
cheap bulldog revolver lay on the ground
near the right hand of the dead man.
In the pockets of , the clothing were
found two . sealed letters, one addressed
to Dr. Charles M. Troppman of 452 Sixth
street.' San Francisco, Â¦ and the other to
Mrs. J. B. Church, 178 E. St. James street,
San Jose. The letter to Mrs. Church re
lates simply to the disposition of his
â¢body. That to Dr. Troppman reads as
follows: , :

tered down the door Of Kagal's bedroom.-
He attacked Nagai with the hatchet and
Nagai'B wife rushed into the. street. and
blew a police whistle. Policeman Herjlhy
responded and when he entered the bed
room found the two Japanese locked in
a deadly embrace and blood pouring from
Nagal's head.' It is not expected that Xa
gai's wounds will prove fatal. .
Marchimago was . Instructed before Po
lice Judge Fritz yesterday and the case
was continued till to-morrow.
Sada Xagai, proprietor of a Japanese
restaurant at 619 Sacramento street, is at

about 4 o'clock- yesterday morning he
knocked at the door of the .room occupied
by Xagai and his wife and demanded
more money, although he had been paid
his wages in full on Wednesday. Nagai
told him to go to bed, as he would not
get any more money.

Many were the little quips that ; crept
Into these toasts, but they were solemnâ
undeniably solemn. .Â¦. ;.. : -
But it must be remembered that women
have toyed with toasts only -a very few.
years and they haven't yet' got on fa
miliar terms with them. .,
The luncheon, taken all in all, was an
eminent, success.^.; The menu, was excel
lent and the place. cards possessed an ar-.'
tistic value all ; their, own. They s were
cleverly executed ' in ' water .{ colors and
were twelve . inches \ long ; by Â¦ ten * wide.
Pretty souvenirs they made of a very
pretty occasion.
The first toast was "Up-to-date He
roes," by Mrs. George Law Smith, presi
dent of the California Club. With rather
an unpromising subject (why will women
select such solemn toasts?) Mrs. ; Smith
did admirably. Her voice was good,'like
wise her enunciation, and what she had
to say carried to the farthest end of the
room. She dwelt on the evanescence of
honors, saying that the hero of yesterday,
was ofttlmes a shattered idol oftQ-day.
She spoke of the early worship of Dewey,
Miles and other wartime heroes, .who later
fell under the ban of public displeasure
for reasons Inexplicable. Altogether Mrs.
Smith's .talk was one of the cleverest
givenâ many of the guests pronouncing* it
to be the' bestâ and there were many
rather clever replies to toasts, If not
startlingly brilliant.
Mrs. Smith was followed by . Mrs. - Ella
M. Sexton on "Ragtime"; '.'Woman's
Weapons," by Miss R, Abel; "The"Stren
uous Life," Mrs. Horace Wilson; "Beaten
Paths," Mrs. Julius Kahn; "Femlnini
ities," by Mrs. Josephine deGreayer;
"Social Diplomacy," Mrs. G. W. Haight;
"Points of View," Mrs. A.'- L. Lengfeld ;
"Americanisms," Mrs. F. G. Sanborn;
"The Literary Guillotine," Mrs. . T. . W.
Collins; "The Bachelor Girl," Mrs. L.. L.
Dunbar; "The Stars and Stripes," Mrs.
W. R. Parnell.
Mrs. Lowenberg, gowned in a gray silk
frock, welcomed her guests with a few
gracious remarks and introduced' her
daughter, Mrs. Brown, as toastmasterâ
and a clever one she proved to be. .
The guests were graciously received by
the hostess, assisted by her daugttter,
Mrs. A, L.- Brown, and Mrs. M. J. Bran

Eva Wineburgh.
At 1 o'clock the ladles . sat down to
tables aglow with roseate lights and
bearing blossoms in prodigal profusion.
Pink prevailed, but green, the color be
loved by nature, was much in evidence.
And when the guests were seatedâ what
a kaleidoscope of color prevailed ! j There
were gowns whltp and gowns pink and
gowns blue; likewise was there black
and gray and ruby red. And such millin
ery! To place a financial estimate? upon
the assembled headgear would be traitor
ous and unwomanly, but the artistic esti
mate can be summed up in a word â it
was. stunning.

Two employes of the F. Thomas Paris
ian Dyeing and Cleaning Works at 27
Tenth street were painfully burned in an
explosion of benzine yesterday afternoon.
The accident is supposed to have been
due to igniting of matches in some of the
clothes that were being put through a
cleaning machine.
The two iniured men, J. W. llarp of 2C
.West Mission street and J. ViessTt of
87 Stevenson street, were woiking near
a cleaning machine which J conlaii ed a
benzine tank with a capacity of twenty
five gallons. When the explosion occurred
the blazing fluid was scattered in all di
rections. A quantity of it struck the two
men and burned their arms and faces se
verely. They were taken to a drug store
in the neighborhood, where temporary re
lief was given, and they were then sent to
the Central Emergency Hospital.

The committee asked Platt if the trans
fer privileges with the Market street road
could - not : be\ continued, ... but Â¦ Platt said
that the .; priceâ $4000 monthlyâ asked by
the United Railroads Was prohibitive.
E. P. E. Troy argued that Platt was en
titled to no consideration from the board,
because a circular had been.issued slan
dering public officials, and that Christo
pher A, Buckley's guide had boasted, that
the former: Democratic boss had used
money . to . buy votes against the proposi
tion^ of the city ownership of the Geary
street , road.** Troy was told . to go to - the
Grand Jury with his plaint.
Platt stated- that the fact that the
United Railroads had' discontinued its
transfer privileges ' would materially re
duce the receipts of the Geary street road.
The Â» big corporation offered continue
the privileges for $4000 per month,'an-in
crease of $3000 above the existing contract,

The Geary Street Company does not consider
the temporary permit as a 'franchise and ad
mits . that it is > revocable at the pleasure of
the board, the object of both the company and
the board being to accommodate the traveling
public . pending the necessary delay incident
to the granting of a new franchise.
The company does not' claim any right to
operate Its cars after the Â¦ expiration of Its
present franchise and - will attempt in no way
to misconstrue Into a franchise this temporary
operation. - /< ~ <
This company - will keep in repair all that
portion of the street between the rails and

1, 1904, providing the company enter into
a written stipulation waiving all rights to
a franchise to operate the ". road and. all
rights to the roadbed and agree to pay 5
per cent of its gross receipts to the, city.
The City Attorney was also asked to
advise whether such a resolution will
jeopardize any of the rights of the city
and could be construed as recognizing or
conferring any right whatever on the
Geary Street Railroad; or its bondholders
or creditors, after February 1,1904.
"Our franchise expires on November 6,"
said .Horace G. Platt, president' of the
company," addressing the committee, "and
we do not claim any rights to run a car
after "that date. In order not to inconve
nience the public we would like to con
tinue operating the cars until a new fran
chise is granted. I state unhesitatingly
and unqualifiedly that the company will
not construe any. temporary permit into a
franchise, privilege. The board of direct
ors of the'eompany will sign a stipulation
relinquishing any rights it might. have in
the premises." i\\

. A. M. Cox, superintendent of the city
delivery department of the San Francisco
Postofflce, was called to testify as to the
utility of the invention.- He said that it
was useful in the - business district,
where the mall was collected by
pestofflee " employes who did nothing
else, but, it was not of much use
In the residence part of town, where
the mails were collected less frequently
and by the same men who delivered the
mails. Mr. Cox admitted that he was a
stockholder in the Montague-Richardson
company. He added that he had made
las statement of all that he knew about
the matter to Inspector Wayland two or
three months ago. and that he had also
told Mr. End-in as to wnat his testimony
would Â£>e regarding the utility of the time
indicator.
UNRELIABLE PAPER REBUKED.
The witness was at this stage of the
proceedings confronted, by. Mr. Knight
with an interview published in an even-
Ing newspaper on June 24," 1903, in which
Mr. Cox is represented as having- highly
praised the device in Â«n<juaUfled terms
"Is the testimony that you have given
here practically the same as that given
ty you before the Grand Jury in Wash
ington?" asked Mr. Knight.
"Yes, sir." was the reply.
."You testified as fully and completely
regarding Mr. Erwin here as you did
there T
"Yrg."
. ".Your examination by the District At
torney here was as complete as it was
by- the prosecuting officer in Washing
"Dld any of these persons on the back
cf this indictment know anything about
Mr. Erwin in these transactions?"
*'I don't know."
"Did Erwin ever advise or consult with
you relative to any stock being given to
Beavers or Machen?"
"Xo. sir."
"Did he have anything to do directly or
â¢Indirectly with the giving of that stock?"
"No."
"He never planned the giving of that
stock with jour*
"No."
"Did Erwin have anything to do with
j-t-u relative to the terms under which
these devices would be shown to the Gov
ernment?"
"Not that I know of."
EEWIFS INNOCENCE SHOWN.
The witness stated In answer to fur
ther questions that Mr. Erwin had noth
ing to do with the negotiations between
the company, and the Government for the
adoption or sale of the de\-lces. He had
assisted in gathering data as to the cost
of manufacture of the time indicators
He thought that Mr. Erwin believed that
the device should receive favorable con
sideration by the department on Its mer
lta. The witness went on -to state that
In June. 1900. Erwin went to Washington
en official business and the Richardson
"memorandum which he took with him
was simply Incidental business. "We as
sumed that we would have to pay the
freight," resumed the witness* "but there
was no understanding with the Govern
ment with reference to that matter." He
could not say why the Government did
not advertise for bids for the time Indi
cator. He supposed that it was adopted
on its merits.
In reply to a question by United States
District Attorney Woodworth Mr. Way
land eald that the Government was not
receiving any more of the Richardson de
vices. Two thousand of them were In
the storehouse at Reading, Pa., and 40tX)
more were in another storehouse, the
Government not having paid for any of
them.
Daniel S. Richardson, who still holds
the position of superintendent of the San
Francisco postofflce. was called to the
stand for cross-examination by Mr.
Knight.
DEVICES ON THE SHELF.
Mr. Knight asked whether the witness
knew of instructions having been given at
Â¦Washington, D. C, to have all mail ad
dressed from that city to Erwin and from
Erwin to persons there opened and in
spected.
The witness replied that no such order
had been given; that the Postmaster
General himself would not have had any
authority to gi\*e such an order, which
would be in plain violation cf the law.
. "When asked as to whether Mr. Erwin
Had not made a statement to the witness
freely and voluntarily, Mr. Wayland re
plied that when he called upon Mr. Erwin
for an explanation the latter did not seem
to know much about the matter, especial
ly with relation to the Government hav
ing been obliged to pay the freight on the
machines and about the increase in the
price from $4 and 54 25 each to $4, $4 50
and (5 for the different sizes. It was then
that" Erwin produced the memorandum
that had been introduced in evidence.
"There was quite a lot of information
that he ought to have given us, but he
d'^n't teil us at all," continued the wit
ness. "We asked him if he had ever writ
ten a letter to Machen, dated February 19,
1300. and he said that he thought that he
"had not written it, but when I produced
the letter he said, 'Yes, that is my signa
ture; I have written that letter.' He
probably never volunteered or told us
anything material about the case until we
had told him that we knew about it, and
then he would tell us about it. Richard
son, as president of the company, gave us
the papers concerning the whole transac
tion."
- PostofficÂ© Inspector C. L. "Wayland of
Washington. D. C, contributed some fur
ther Interesting information before United
States Court Commissioner Heacock yes
terday afternoon with regard to the ways
2nd means by which Daniel S. Richard
son and his associates prevailed upon
August W. Machen and George \V. Beav
ers to adopt tiie time indicator letter box
device without advertising for bids and
without considering the merits of other
devices that had been offered to the Post
office Department at less than one-third
the cost. This information was brought
out on the cross-examination by Samuel
Knight, attorney for James W. Erwin,
the indicted postal official.
Â¦ Mr. Wayland swore that some of the
devices xm file in Machen's office in Wash
ington ' were automatic, and nearly all
were simpler than the one put on the
market by" the Montague- Richardson Com
pany. Some of the devices had been test
ed by the Government, he said, but he did
not know why they had not been accepted.
V- WHAT ERWIN KNEW.
In the Cross Examination Attorney
Knight Brings to light Some Very-
Interesting Tacts in Post
office Scandal.
Â£new Little Concerning the
Sale of Mail Boxes to
Government.
The cases came up for trial, ' but were
never finished, a compromise being ef
fected. The trust company agreed to al
low the deeds of the realty to stand and
withdraw its charge of undue influence
provided the Brundages would give up all
claim to the personal property. .This of
fer was accepted by .the- Brundages ; and
in June,. 1900, all the x sults were dismissed.
Later the property was distributed.
It is now claimed, by the Park Commis
sioners and the other plaintiffs in the
present actions that they were not parties
to the compromise. The Commissioners
especially oppose Â¦ the settlement on the
ground that by the retention, by the
Brundages of the realty the park Is de
spoiled of the . wherewithal to carry out
Sweeney's plans as made by him when
he was mentally capable and which he at
that time provided for in his will.
INTERESTED IN PARK.
The Park Commissioners' interest in the
estate of Sweeney is. due to the fact that
Sweeney during hia life showed a'decid
ed Interest in Golden Gate Park. It was
at his expense, that Strawberry Hill was
beautified and he also defrayed the cost
of the erection of the observatory on it3
summit. He frequently stated that he
would complete the building and told
several of his friends that in the event of
his death his relatives would carry out
his plans. In 1595, while the building was
in course of erection-, Sweeney' made his
will, and when it was offered for probate
after his death in January, 1900, it showed
that he had fulfilled his promise. The
will contained a clause bequeathing to the
California Title and Trust Company, ex
ecutor of the will, in trust for. the Park
Commissioners, a block of land south of
the park. The will directed the executor
to. use the' realty for the benefit of the
Strawberry Hill project and empowered
it to make such disposition of it as would
best enable the Commissioners to carry
out his plans. The property was never
distributed according to the terms of the
will, however, as Mary Ann Brundage,
sister of the deceased, and Charles S.
Brundage, her husband, came forward
with deeds executed by Sweeney in Oc
tober, November and December, 1S99, giv
ing them all the property he had previ
ously disposed of by will. All the deeds
were executed within three months of
the death of the testator, at a time when,
It. Is alleged, he was mentally, incompe
tent, and suits to cancel them were im
mediately begun by the trust company.
The , Brundages also brought suits, they
asking for a decree declaring the title to
the land, to be vested in them.
BRTTNDAOES TAKE BEAXTY.
The Park Commissioners' suit to set
aside the judgments obtained through the
compromise of the stilts over the estate
of Thomas U. Sweeney , was partly heard
yesterday by Judge Seawell. The suit Is
one of the four brought for a similar pur
pose, the other three being by W. E. and
C. C. Lane, brothers-in-law of ' Sweeney,
and Lucy Clark, his sister-in-law. The
defendant in each action Is Charles S.
Brundage, Sweeney's brother-in-law, and
owner under the compromise of several
blocks of land &outh of. the park. The
suits are brought on the ground that
neither the Lanes nor Mrs. Clark^nor the
Park . Commissioners were parties to the
compromise and on\ the further ground
that Sweeney was of unsound mind at
the - time he conveyed to Brundage the
property in dispute. A number of wit
nesses were examined yesterday by for
mer Superior Judge Dalngerfleld, attorney
for the Commissioners, arid they all tes
tified that Sweeney was undoubtedly
mentally weak during the last year of his
life. Their acquaintance with Sweeney,
they said, extended over a period of ten
years or more, and they each related
many Incidents tending to prove the Com
missioners' claim that he was incompe
tent. Several of them testified also that
Sweeney's hobby was the upbuilding of
Golden Gate" Park and In particular
Strawberry Hill, upon' which he had par
tially erected an observatory. The wit
nesses were Cyrus Hault, N. W. Hanks,
Henry Beaver, Dr. F. W. Harris, V>\ O.
Scott and George B. Mackrett.
