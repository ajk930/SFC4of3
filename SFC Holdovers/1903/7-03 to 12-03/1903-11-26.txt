SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, NOYEMBER 26; 1903.
It was several minutes later before
the two women recovered sufficiently
from their fright to fully realize the
situation, and then they quickly turned
to the unfortunate victim, who was
lying on the floor, apparently in a life
less state.* Their first thought was for
Major -McClung's comfort, and a hur
ried summons for medical assistance
was responded to . by Dr. George, vF.
Shlels, a resident of the hotel. A quick
examination of the major's wound,
which was at the lower . end of the
breastbone, satisfied the surgeon that
the casÂ« was serious, and at his sug
gestion an ambulance was telephoned
for and the injured man. was hastily
conveyed. to the Waldeck Sanatorium.
Strangely the tragedy did hot be
come known to the other guests and
,the management , of the Palace until
the hospital stewards, bearing the body
of i McClung," quietly carried : It .on' a
stretcher down the New Montgomery
street side of ,the i hotel and placed It in
the ambulance awaiting them on Jessie
street." It was then J that . the. assistant
manager of the hotel Instituted.an^nj
vestlgatlon and,*faillng to glean a sat :
Isfactory - explanation of. the 'affair,
promptly " summoned the, police, who
took I charge of ' the Â¦ case. One of. the
first Â«' moves "(jnade was to obtain from
McClung ; at :< the .Waldeck hospital . a
statement -of â¢_ the shooting and' the
name i of .the ' man who was : guilty of
the > v murderous assault! Then ; the
search' for : Garnett was begun, . but up
to an* early hour* this morning "the, de-
ter 5 o'clock in the apartments of Mrs.
Colt on the third floor 'of the Palace
Hotel and was .witnessed by the fright
ened lady- and her maid. Immediately
after the affair Garnett hurried from
the scene of the shooting and . slipping
out of the hotel made his escape in the
darkness of the evening, which was
rapidly enshrouding the city.

Fearing that Hays would transfer his
property the company placed a special

papers. When Hays' grafting was dis
covered he executed a deed to the
company and agreed to deliver it to a

then Hays has delayed the delivery of
the deed, and until delivery it was," of

CHICAGO. Nov. 25.â Although a ba
sis of settlement of the strike of the
employes of the Chicago City Railway
Company was decided upon at 1:30
o'clock this morning and the agreement
was ratified by the men a few hours
later, not a single car is in service on
the entire system to-night. The only
cars operated to-day were manned by
non-union crews and "the same condi
tions have prevailed since the institu
tion- of the strike a week ago S last
Thursday.
For'; some unexplained reason the
management of theChicago City Rail
way was not officially notified until to
night that the strike had been 'declared
off. While the men were. ratifying the
agreement decided upon early, this
morning, by which the men Â¦ were to
return to work, the company continued
to operate its cars under police pro
tection on the five branch lines that
had been opened for traffic since the
beginning of the strike, and as no offi
cial notice of the cessation of hostili
ties had been received by the officials
of the road at 5 o'clock to-night, the
usual time of abandoning the service
since the trouble began, arrangements
were made for the cars to run to-mor
row, guarded by the police. To-night,
however. Assistant Chief of Police
Schuettler, who has had charge of the
police: who have been guarding the
cars, was notified that his services and
those J of his men would no longer be
required, as word had been received by
Manager McCullough from President
Mahon of the strikers' union that the
strikehad been declared off.
-" The^trainmen have been ordered to
return for duty at 4 o'clock to-morrow
morning. The electric linemen, firemen
and engineers, cable splicers and coal
teamsters returned to work to : nlght

There seems no escape from Congres
sional investigation into the armor
plate bids, it is said. The agreement
between Louis Nixon and Daniel Le
Roy Dresser in behalf of the shipyard
trust and C. M. Schwab for Morgan &
Co. was brought out in the testimony
for the first time and confirmed the re
port of Morgan ownership Much was
made to-day also of proof of misrepre
sentations by C. M. Schwab when . he
sold the Bethlehem Company for Mor
gan & Co. He turned it over, claiming
it had a surplus of $4,000,000.
The testimony showed that a month
before its sale he received a report from
Jones, Caesar & Co., his own account
ants, telling him the surplus was $250,
000 less than the $4,000,000 claimed.' A
month after the sale this $250,000 was
formally written off, and two months
later the surplus was reported to the
Stock Exchange as still $4,000,000. This
will, it is said, be made the basis of a
formal charge of fraud. +$
NEW YORK, Nov. 25.â Should J. P.
Morgan & Co. by any chance succeed
In effecting the compromise so earnest
ly desired with the United States Ship
building Company contesting" bond-,
holders, a new suit is to be begun that
will place all further suppression of
facts out of the question. James B. Dill
will conduct it.
This â¢ was the report current to-day
and it was accompanied by rumors of
an arrest soon to be made in the.ship
yard case.
The idea that Morgan & Co. should
effect any compromise was ridiculed by
attorneys for the bondholders. Sam
uel Untermeyer, who, with Henry
Wollman, is conducting the case for the
bondholders, stands un the statement
made bv him two weeks ago that no
money consideration can ever effect a
compromise, but that only an honest
plan of reorganization can stop pro

Speciai Dispatch to The Call,
Governor Peabody and Adjutant Gen
eral Bell have received threatening let
ters within the past few days. One of
the communications to General Bell
says:
"You will be popped off if you ever
come to Cripple Creek."
Another 'letter warns the officials of
the existence of a plot to blow up the
wing of the Capitol where the Gov
ernor's and 'adjutant general's offices
are located. All such letters are turned
over to the PJnkerton agency as fast
as received. No attempt has been made
to guard the military offices, because
no fears are entertained that any vio
lence will be attempted in Denver.
General Bell was in communication
with the Sheriff of Las Anlmas County
for more than an hour to-day, and the
report was In circulation that troops
were being placed in readiness to move
to the coal fields. The reserve force
numbers 500 men, and they will be fully
equipped within the next few days.
General Bell -called his stenographer
Into his office this afternoon and dic
tated the following statement for pub
lication:
"We will fight it out in Colorado if It
takes every able-bodied man in the
State, and some who are disabled, to
the end that law and order be main
tained and socialism, anarchy and
Moyerism are wiped off the earth and
there isn't a grease spot left to assas
sinate, dynamite, molest, disturb or In
any manner interfere with the commer
cial conditions and the peace of.illus
trious Colorado."
General Bell has given orders to^have
two more regiments formed in the.Colo
rado National Guard, and in the course
of the week he expects to recniit 600
men.

DENVER, Nov. 25.â Startling discov
eries have resulted from the investiga
tion into the blowing up of the Vindi
cator mine, in the Cripple Creek dis
trict, on Saturday, according to Adju
tant General Bell. He says that those
Â¦who caused the explosion which killed
Superintendent . McCormack and Mel
vin Beck also plotted to blow up the
Gold Coin, Findley, Golden Cycle, Strat
ton's Independence and several other
properties.
General Bell learned that the revolver
found at the scene of the explosion was
one sold by the manufacturers to s the
San Juan Hardware Company on Octo
ber 2. A partial description of -the man
who bought the revolver was obtained.
General Bell is sure that the man is
one of the sixteen now being guarded
in the military lines at Camp Goldfleld.
He is certain that all of those con
cerned in the Vindicator affair, with
one exception, are in custody. One of
the .men wanted succeeded in getting
out of the district before a cordon of
soldiers was thrown around the camp
and I* on his way to Seattle, according
to information which has been gath
ered since his departure. It is believed
that he will escape.
M'KINNEY GIVES INFORMATION.
Of the sixteen men now being held at
Camp Goldfield about a dozen are
charged with having been principals
or accessories In the* Vindicator affair.
The remainder are held In connection
with the attempt to wreck a Florence
and Cripple Creek train a few days
ago.
It is generally believed that Charles
McKlnney, the alleged train-wrecker,
who was spirited out of the district to
the penitentiary for safe keeping, is. the
person from whom the authorities have
obtained much Incriminating evidence.
One proof that violence was plotted
Is the fact that non-union miners at
work on the properties said to have
been included in the doomed list have
been receiving mysterious warnings not
to work upon peril of bearing the con
sequences.

COLON, Xov. "25.â The " local corre
spondent of the Associate* Press to
day received a telegram from Bogota,
dated November 21,. saying that the
Government had Issued orders to raise
the army footing to 100,000 men. in the
event that General Reyes" mission to

subjugation of Panama is given as the
reason for the Government's action-
German and Italian steamships ar
rived here' to-day from Cartagena and
SavanilJa. They report^ everything
quiet at those places, but that the peo
ple are still Indignant over the seces
sion of Panama. The captain of an
Italian steamship was offered 100,000
francs to carry 500 Colombian troops to
Colon. â¢
The Colombians are building great
hopes on the mission of General Reyes
to Washington, believing he will be
able to make some arrangement by
which Panama will re-enter the Colom
bian federation.
The American warships Maine, At
lanta, Dixie and Mayflower and a col
lier are in the harbor. The Mayflower
is alongside the collier, fiJJinjj her
bunkers.
It is proposed, when the messenger
bearing the Panama canal treaty
reaches Colon on December 1. to have a
Fpecial train ready to transport him
across the isthmus to Panama, where'
the treaty undoubtedly will be signed
by the members of the junta. ; The
train, meantime, will be kept waiting.
and, when the treaty is signed, its
bearer will be brought back to Colon.
The steamship Yucatan, scheduled to
call on December 1 for New York, will
be delayed until the "messenger arrives,
when he will embark on the Yucatan,
thus starting for New York on the day
of his arrival hero.
This proposal is meeting with some
opposition, those desiring to discuss" the
treaty at length fearing that its terms
will be too favorable to the United
States. It is probable, however, that
this opposition will be overcome.

bitter fiscal warfare with our cousins,
the United States, as the result of
which Great Britain would lose every
thing and gain nothing. It would mean
a practical severance far more deplor
able than a fiscal severance and would
blight the fairest hope of the two na
tions."
In summing up Lord Jtosebery said
that Joseph Chamberlain had not
proved his case and that the evils of
which he complained existed only In
his Imagination. A real remedy for Â«ny
adverse conditions could be reached by
stimulating practical, technical and
commercial education, reducing the na
tional expenditure and the drink bill of
the people, encouraging the growth of
cotton within th? empire, teaching
commercial travelers how to study the
tastes of the people they visited and
through other simple and practical
steps "which would .be better training
for race competition than mandates for
negotiation with foreign countries."
LONDON, Nov. 25.â Lord Rosebery
spoke.to 3000 persons on the fiscal ques
tion^ at the Surrey Theater to-night.
William J. Bryan was in the audience.
There, were 20,000 applications for tick
ets, the issue of which had to be lim
ited: to the capacity of the theater.
Lord Rpsebery^afterward addressed a
large overflow meeting. At both meet
ings he was given an enthusiastic re
ception and all througn his speeches
he was heartily cheered. His Lord
ship's,remark3 were for the most part
devoted to ridiculing Joseph Chamber
lain, and hisTTolicy.
."After last night's meeting at Queen's
Hall, which was attended by seven
members of Lord Salisbury's Govern
ment," said the speaker,, "little can be
added. The fiscal question must be
solved and finally settled, and unless
it is settled the dissolution of Parlia
ment; cannot be long delayed."
Lord Rosebery referred to Chamber
lain ae "a modern Jeremiah, whose as
sertions that the country had been des
olated were refuted 'by the facts."
Chamberlain \sald the country was
ruined, while Balfour. on the other
hand,' said the country was extremely
prosperous, but soon would be ruined.

ever, had decided against both of these
contentions. The speaker said that the
condition of the people generally had
been improved, while, the worklngmen
were enjoying greater prosperity. If
distress. existed In the country it was
because of the unwise expenditures of
the Government, which during the last
decade had increased 62 per cent, while
during tbe previous ten' years there had
been an increase of only 7 per cent.
"Instead of curbing -this growing ex
penditure," said Lord Rosebery, "Mr.
Chamberlain discovered a disease which
had not existence ana proposed a rem
edy which"* would make the disease
worse â namely, the increase in the cost
of every commodity."
. The real outcome of M^v Chamber
lain's policy, said Lord Rosebery. would
be a state of socialism. The cry of
"dumping" applied to the large empo
riums in this country which had killed
the small traders. During recent years
Canada had dumped into Great Britain
nearly as much iron as all the dumping
countries put together. A committee of
experts, said the speaker, would have
to d'stinguish between foreign and im
perially dumped and "sweated" goods.
"The flrstresult of. Mr. Chamberlain's

FIBE COMPANY FAD.
Mrs. Colt was In the early '60's one
of the prominent figures in San Fran
cisco and was w.ell and favorably
known Â¦ in* the society of forty years
ago. When she was Miss Hitchcock she
had a mania for running to fires, and
whenever an alarm from any of the
twelve districts which the city was di
vided into at that time was sounded
from the tower on the old City Hall
she was among the first to run for the
district, \ and She never missed an; op
portunity to take a place on the rope,
for in those days the engines were
hauled by the members of the compa
nies. Her favorite company , was
Knickerbocker No. 5, located on Sacra
mento street, opposite her father's pro
fessional office.
In time she was enrolled as an hon
orary, member of the company, and is
the only woman whose name was in-,
scribed on the roll of the Volunteer Fire
Department.
She had many suitors' for her hand,
but none were up to her ideal for a hus
band, until she met handsome Howard
Coit, caller of the San Francisco stock
board during the great mining boom,
and she married him.
After she became his widow she pur
chased a site in Larkmead, Napa Coun
ty, where she had erected'a'magnifi
cent home, and there she has spent the
greater part of her widowhood. In he*;
retirement she has never forgotten the
Knickerbocker Fire Company, for every
year on the anniversary of .its-organ
ization she has sent to the association,
composed of surviving ' members, a
handsome floral piece.
Major McClung. who was grie-qotisrty
wounded in protecting Mrs. Coit belongs
to what is known as the Southern set
of local society. He married a daugh
ter of the late Dr. R. Beverly Cole: One
of his brothers was In the City Treas
urer's office during the administration
of Colonel Brooks.
CAUSES HUSH, AT BALK
The opening- ball of La Jeunesse took
place last night,, and Mrs.-. McClung
was expected' to be one of the patron
esses. When she did not appear at the
appointed " time surprise was on the
face of every one, as Bhe has always
been noted for being exceedingly punc
tual. Suddenly the news of the shoot
ing was quietly whispered about the
ballrbom and it caused a tremendous
sensation. In fact, for the nonce,
dancing was entirely suspended and
all talk given over to the subject of
the shooting. â¢,
Later it developed that Mrs. McClung
had not learned of the* shooting, and
that the cause of her absence from the
festivities was due to the illness of her
daughter, who is an inmate of the
Children's Hospital. â¢ ...
Mrs. McClung's daughters , have al-.
ways been great favorites in the soclial
world and have hosts of friends.
It was only natural- that the event
should cause a great sensation. For a
few minutes the ballroom was practi
cally deserted, and it, was only when
the reassuring news came that Major
McClung's wound had not been fatal
that the gay festivities of the evening
were resumed. , ; . '
DBANK EXCESSIVELY.
The search for Garnett by Detectives
Bryan and Bailey, in whose -charge the
case was placed by Captain of Detec
tives Martin, lasted until long after
midnight and was finally temporarily
abandoned by the sleuths, who are con
fident that they will be able to arrest
the missing man to-day. Inquiry at
the Brooklyn Hotel late last night de
veloped the fact that Garnett had not
been seen there since early in the day.
Several months ago Garnett reported
to the police that he had been waylaid
early in the evening near the entrance
cf the Brooklyn Hotel and robbed of a
small amount of money. He told a
story of how he was knocked down and
his pockets rifled, but an investigation
by trie police resulted in the conclusion
that he had been drinking heavily arid
had fallen while trying to reach his ho
tel. Since then Garnett is said to have
been on frequent sprees.
Garnett Is of medium size, about' 50
years of age, arid of late has appeared
morose. He was in the habit of walk
ing about" town alone, except when Mrs.
Coit was here, and seldom recognized
former acquaintances. He is not, how
ever, supposed" to be insane. .Â¦"[â¢.?, ,^
Mrs. Coit agrees with Major McClung
that Garnett's act was simply the re
sult of excessive drinking.

Dr. George F. Shlels, Major Mc-
Clung's family physician, was sum
moned to attend the Injured man a few
moments after the shooting. Dr. Shiels
says the call for his assistance came
about 5 o'clock. He. hurried with, all
possible speed to the apartments of
Mrs. Colt, where he found Major Mc-
Clung in an unconscious condition.
"I. found the major to be in a very
weak condition when I arrived," said
Dr. Shlels. "He was unconscious and
the blood was flowing profusely from
a dangerous looking wound in the
breast. Luckily none of the vital or
gans were touched by the bullet, still
the wound is a dangerous one and
likely to result fatally.
"From what information I could
gather the shooting was the result of
a drunken man's craze for vengeance
for imaginary wrongs. Major Mc-
Clung had called at Mrs. Colt's apart
ments for the purpose of making a so
cial visit. He was In the . room but a
short time, when a noise was heard out
side and Garnett* entered the apart
ment unannounced. . Â¦ . /
"From what I understand Garnett
was very much under the; Influence of
liquor. ; He* greeted the lady in a gruff,
Having first looked to the comfort of
her wounded friend, Mrs. Colt and her
maid locked themselves in their apart
ments and for a long time pondered
over the proper course to pursue, for
they both realized that the affair would
give them a lot of notoriety. Finally
Mrs. Colt appealed to several of her
friends for advice and learning for, the
first time of her unfortunate predica
ment they were quick to go to her
rescue. '
It was not until after 8 o'clock in the
evening, three hours after the occur
rence of the shooting, that it became
generally known about the Palace Ho
tel, and then it creates a great furor
among the guests, the majority of
whom are acquainted with Mrs. Coit
and were deeply in sympathy with her
In her sudden trouble.
DR. SHTELS* STATEMENT.
NEWS BECOMES KNOWN.
Realizing the horrible deed that he
had committed,* Garnett again con
cealed his weapon,' and. glancing
toward. Mrs. Coit in a manner that
might have been interpreted as a warn
ing to her to makf no outcry or follow
him. he made his scape from the room.
The apartments of Mrs. Coit are lo
cated on the New Montgomery-street
side of the hotel and yesterday the
rooms adjoining were unoccupied, a
fact, which may explain why the re
port of the pistol shot attracted no at
tention and aided the murderous Gar
riett 1 to make his escape.
Quickly perceiving the danger of the
defenseless woman, Major McClung
sprang forward with outstretched
arms, with the intention of grabbing
Garnett an'd preventing him from car
rying out his murderous threat. Quick
as he wa* however. Garnett noted his
move and suddenly turning the pistol
in* the -direction of the major he fired.
With a gasp, McClung fell forward
uptrn the floor and then rolled partly
over on his back. , -.
. Stung by the conduct of the man
whom she had 60 long befriended, the
lady ordered him from her apartments
and told him that he. need never return
to them. On. several occasions since
tlils affair Garnett had tried to obtain
a hearing Avith Mrs. Coit, but she had
denied him the privilege; He men
tioned'the fact to his attorney, who ad
vised him to keep away from her, and
she heard no more from him until his
visit yesterday afternoon.
At the time Mrs. Coit was entertain
ing Major McClung, an old friend of
her family and one of a number of
gentlemen who have for nearly twen
ty-five years been frequent caller^ at
her rooms while she was in the city.
It was during a friendly discussion of
old times that Mrs. Coit and her guest
were suddenly startled by a terrible
noise at the entrance of her apart
ments, and a second later Garnett,
looking like a crazy man, bounded Into
their presence. ' '... ' .
. Evidently tbe fellow had not expected
to meet any one other than Mrs. Hitch
ccek Coit in the rooms, for he suddenly
paused as his eyes fell on Major Mc-
Clung, and for several moments he did
not utter a word. Then suddenly ap
proaching the lady, who had risen from
her chair, he boldly told her that his
mission, was one of murder. Drawing
a pistol Garnett started toward Mrs.
CoitÂ» shouting as he approached:
"i am going: .to kill you!" ..
MAJOR SPRINGS FORWARD.
ORDERED FROM ROOMS.
The motive of Garnett in attempting
4o kill- Mrs. Colt is believed to have
its origin In .her . recent refusal to
further "tolerate .' his presence In her
apartments, or in any way ehare with
him her confidence, which he had been
enjoying for many years." Garnett had
been dependent on Mrs. Colt for a num
ber of years and had received bountiful
charity from both ' herself and her
mother, who passed I away several
months ago. He toad been intrusted
witU the transaction of small business
matters connected with the large in
terests of the _lady and in the perform
ance of these trifling duties . Garnett
had finally come to be known as the
financial agent of "Mrs. Coit. Among
the # ladyfs properties Is the old Brook
lyn" Hqtel- building on Bush street and
thfere ehe. provided for him a comfort
able room. . '
For some time Garnett has been
drinking heavily, a fact which came to
his relative's knowledge when she re
turned from a Jong absence abroad.
After her return Garriett, as had been
his "custom for many years, was a daily
frequenter of Mrs. Coifs rooms at the
Palace Hotel, and often, in the after
noons, she and he. would pass an hour
or so in~playing a favorite game of
cards.' Last week he visited her rooms
in anything but a pleasant mood, and
noticing this fact the lady, who is of an
amiable disposition, suggested their
usual game. Garnett had been drink
ing earlier in the day, and the sud
deh turn of the game of cards against
.him provoked him. When his bene
factress Â¦ remonstrated with him for
his . ungentlemanly conduct, Garnett
turned upon her and Insulted her in a
brutal manner.

LIVED AT OCCIDEJTTAL.
A close friend of Mrs. Coit said:
"Alex Garnett, as he is generally called,
has been practically dependent on Mrs.
Coifa bounty for many years. He lived
at the Brooklyn Hotel, which is one of
her many properties. It was his cus
tom to occasionally spend the evening
at her rooms in the Palace and join
in a social game of cards with her.
Last* week he called, and while they
were playing crlbbage he suddenly be
came very violent in his language, and
Mrs. Coit was compelled to have him
removed from her apartments. He took
this treatment very much to heart and
wrote her several letters of apology,
to which she declined to reply. V ,
"Yesterday afternoon Major McClung,
who is an old time friend of Mrs.
Colt's family, was calling, when sud
denly the door to the drawing room
was burst op^n and in rushed Garnett,
very much under the influence of li
quor. He tore open his vest and-pro
duced a pistol and was about to level
it at her head, when Major McClung
jumped in between the two and while
endeavoring to divert Garnett's aim,
received the bullet.
"McClung fell to the floor and Mrs.
Colt, with a shriek of terror, rushed
toward the telephone with the idea of
calling a physician, but before she
could get to the pftone, Garnett antici
pated her movements and tore the
wires down. He then grabbed Mrs.
Coit by the throat and placing the pis
tol at her breast threatened to shoot
her, but suddenly a gleam of-intelli
gence struck his befuddled brain, and
he "relaxed his hold and dropped his
weapon." -. -.
"Major is by no means a
young man, still he has health and a
vigorous constitution, which may save
his life. He will be kept In seclusion
and no one will be allowed to disturb
him, for he needs rest and quiet most
of all. A change for better or worse
should set in shortly, so that it will
soon be known whether or not the in
jured man will survive his wound."
While Dr. Bhiels holds out hope for
the recovery of the wounded man, still
by his manner and his speech he plain
ly shows the anxiety he feels for his
patient. His manner, more than his
speech, would lead the observer to
think that he believes the injured man
will not survive, though he will not ad
mit this as being his opinion.
The wounded man is being accorded
every possible care at the Waldeck
Sanatorium. He is being treated per
sonally by Dr. Shlels and a special
nurse waits constantly at his bedside,
ready to administer to him at any mo
ment. He rests calmly and his symp
toms are favorable, but- still he is ex
ceedingly weak and unless he gains in
strength within the next few hours
death is likely to ease his sufferings. .
TRIES TO SHOOT HER.
WOUND A DANGEROUS ONE.
"Mrs. Coit was seized with fear and
was too frightened to make an outcry.
In the meantime the major sprang
from his seat and ran between the pair.
In an instant he shoved the inebriated
man aside and was about to eject him
from the room, when the latter coolly
turned his revolver on the major and
fired point blank at his stomach.
"With a groan, Major McClung fell
to the floor. The assassin replaced his
pistol in his pocket and walked from
the room. As eoon as Mrs. Coit re
covered her self-possession she ran for
aid. I was summoned and arrived on
the scene a few minutes after the shoot
ing happened.
"The major was directly facing his
assailant when the shot was fired. The
bullet entered at the breast bone, but
fortunately it did not penetrate any of
the vital organs. Major McClung bled
profusely, and at the present time he is
exceedingly weak. I had him removed
immediately to the Waldeck Sanato
rium, where everything possible is be
ing done to save his life. Â»Â¦ \
"Yes, there is a good chance for^his
recovery if complications do not set In.
When last I saw the major he was in
an unconscious condition, but resting
easily. The wound is a very dangerous
one, and what results will follow I am
not prepared to say. I will state, how
ever, that Major McClung is in a crit
ical condition, yet I have hopes for the
best, though a relapse may come (-at
any moment.

sation followed. Then Garnett sudden
ly arose and Mrs. Colt followed Iiis
example. The wild eyed, drink crazed
man, without any warning whatever,
pulled a pistol out of hl3 hip pocket
and in a loud tone informed Mrs. Coit

PITTSBURG. Nov. 25.â Panic en
sued at a fire In the Avenue Theater
tihs afternoon, which communicated to
the audience in the Grand Opera
House, next door. Fifth avenue was
jammed by people rushing out of both
buildings and the firemen and crowd
rushing to the scene.
George McKenzie was operating the
cinematograph, the last act on the
vaudeville bill -at the Avenue. The
house was about one-half filled, as
many had gone out. The first scene
was thrown on the canvas and the next
was a fire scene â but it took place be
tween the second and third galleries.
An electric spark Ignited the cellu
loid box and film In the cinematograph
machine and the flames ignited window
frames and the third gallery. The
brjRht flash did not alarm the audience
until some one in the gallery cried
"Fire" and made a rush for the stairs.
The audience got out in fairly orderly
shape, but.many hats, wraps and coats
were found in drenched condition later.
Stage hands rushed forward with hand
grenades and extinguishers and fought
the flames until the firemen gained an
entrance from windows, as the crowd
below kept them out. MacKenzle, the
operator, was the only one injured.
Before the fire was extinguished
Harry Davis, the owner of the theater,
had a banner out on the street:

"Are the reports true that Senator
Platt is out of it altogether?"
"Senator Platt," the Governor re
plied, with great solemnity, "should be
regarded as-the State leader as long as
he lives."
"J do not care to say anything fur
ther about the conference," he con
cluded, "except that it resulted in har
monizing matters which were In a
badly strained condition last week,* and
that the result was attained by bend-
Ing on both sides. We are all united
now for the success of the party in this
State."
"How about the vote of this State in
the Republican National Convention?"
"I have never expressed any doubt
tnat it would be given to Roosevelt i
When his attention was called to the
reports from Washington th&t Senator'
Platt had conceded everything and
I turned over the leadership to him, the
j Governor smiled and said:
â¢ "Well, I would not put it so strongly.
I may say, however, that the result of
the conference was eminently satisfac
tory as far as I am concerned. I may
add that in the future I will be more
active in politics in this State than I
have been."
"You have 'been pretty active all
along:." was suggested.
"Yes," replied the Governor, "but I
will be more active in future. You
may draw any inference you please
from that."
"Will your activity extend to New
York City politics?"
"Yes," was the reply, "I think the
local Republican organization can be
improved and I have my ideas about
putting it into better shape by next
year."
NEW YORK. Nov. 25.â Governor B.
B. Odell spent a few hours in this city
to-day on his return to Albany from
Washington, where he conferred yes
terday with President Roosevelt and
Senator Thomas C. Platt about the
conditions in the Republican party in
this State. Odell said the conference
had brought about harmony in place of
the badly strained relations which had
existed; that Senator Platt was still
the leader of the party in the State,
but he himself would hereafter take a
more active part in its management;
that the restoration of cordial relations
had been brought about by concessions
on both sides, and that further details
of the conference "were not of interest
to persons, but to the party."
In regard to the vote of this State
in the Republican National Convention
he said that he had always expressed
himself as believing that it would be
given to President Roosevelt.
"Do you care to make any formal
statement about the result of the con
ference at Washington yesterday on
the condition of affairs in this State?"
the Governor was asked.
"No, there is nothing I can say in
that way," he replied. "We simply
had a conference and arranged mat
ters in a way satisfactory to both
sides. Senator Platt is still the leader
of the party in this State. There has
never been any disposition to take the
leadership from him."

The Tribune to-morrow will say:
"Friends of Governor Odell, In position
to speak with more than usual knowl
edge in regard to the Governor's views
and plans, said last night that the
Governor's programme for a reorgani
zation included the following shifts:
"William Barnes Jr. to be chairman
of the Republican State Committee, in
place of George W. Dunn; William C.
Warren of Buffalo to be member of the
Republican National . Committee, in
place of George R. Sheldon; Charles Hr
Murray or Alexander T. Mason to be
president- of the Republican County
Committee, in place of Linn Bruce; a
new secretary of the County Committee
in place of George H. Manchester; new
district leaders in the places of at least
a half dozen State place holders whose
districts have shown a growing tend
ency to become hopelessly Democratic;
a Bhift of the Republican State head
quarters from the Fifth Avenue Hotel
to the Republican Club. â¢
"Yes, Odell believes that Roosevelt
will get the delegation, as does every
one In the Republican organization."
MANY HEADS TO FALL.
"In what direction?"
"I don't care to say." the Senator
replied, and he also declined to commit
himself when asked what means would
be adopted to bring about the changes
suggested by Odell.
"Was Governor Odell correct in
stating that Roosevelt will get the New
York delegation to the next national
convention?" he was asked, In con
clusion.
There was absolutely nothing In the
report that Federal appointments
would hereafter be arranged by the
Governor, he said. -
"In regard to the political situation
in this city, Odell says it needs re
form," said the interviewer.
"Yes, he has been saying It all
around," replied Platt.
"Do you thinlc it needs reform?"
"Yes."
and I do not like repeated questions on
that point," he replied.
PLATT'S VIEW OF SITUATION.
Senator T. C. Platt, on his arrival
here late to-day from Washington, con
firmed Governor Odell's statement that
harmony In Republican politics In New
York State had been restored as a re
sult of the conference with President
Roosevelt in Washington. He was
asked about Governor Odell's assertion
that there had been a very strained
condition of affairs in the State or
ganization, but replied that Odell would
have to explain what he meant there
by.
"I have seen accounts of what took
place at the conference yesterday," said
he, "but I do not care to make any
statement about it. There Is no public
Interest in it. We had^a very pleasant
time with the President, and entire
harmony was restored. Yes, I am still
State leader, and I don't know of any
one In authority who disputes it."
He listened with interest to an ac
count of Governor Odell's Interview,
but made no comment, and when asked
about the Governor's statement that
he would participate even more active
ly in politics In this State hereafter,
said:
"Yes, Odell will take a more active
part. 1 *

BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 25.â The Jury
in the case of the People vs. Alfred
W. Hulse was discharged at 4 o'clock
this afternoon after having been out
twenty-two hours. The jury stood
evenly divided. The defense requested,
and the prosecution agreed, to sixty
days' time before further action is
taken. Attorney Packard stated to
day that the case will be tried again.
When the jury retired last night the
first ballot stood seven for conviction
and five for acquittal. Two Jurors sub
sequently changed their votes and un
til late tlils afternoon each succeeding
ballot showed a vote of seven to five
for acquittal. On the last vote, how
ever, one juror changed, and the last
ballot showed six to six. â¢
Hulse -was very pale when the jury
came in, and although it was known
that there had been no agreement, he
scanned the face of each man eagerly.
In addition to having to stand a second
trial for the alleged murder of Tib
bet, there is a charge against Hulse of
having murdered Marshal Packard. If
both these cases fall there is still the
charge of harboring an outlaw, which
Hulse has acknowledged many times.
On account of prior convictions a sen
tence of ten years can be imposed Jor
the latter crime in the event of a con
viction being secured. Jennie Fox, the
French woman who was in the Joss
house during the fight, is still held In
jail as a witness, although she was not
called by either side. She twice testi
fied under oath that Hulse and a third
man were in the building and assisted
McKinney.* Later she retracted every
thing and the case was much weakened
by her defection. The defense was also
afraid to use her, as her ' statement
would be impeached by her former tes
timony.

SAN JOSE, Nov. 25.â The abrogation
of a contract and the tearing up of a
third rail has precipitated what prom
ises to be a bitter legal fight between
the San Jose and Santa Clara-Electric
Railway and the San Jose- Los Gatos
Interurban Railway. A short time ago
both roads were granted franchises on
North Market street from Santa Clara
street to the broad gauge depot. In
order to protect the street and save
expense an agreement was entered
Into between the companies by
which a third rail was to be laid in
the Interurban tracks for the San Jose
and Santa Clara line, which is a nar
row gauge. The rails had been laid
and the road completed with the ex
ception of putting on the cement. The
Interurban repudiated its contract with
the other company yesterday and tore
up the third rail. Work was at once
rushed in putting the cement work
back in place.
The San Jose and Santa Clara Street
Railway obtained an injunction in
Judge Hyland's court this afternoon
stopping the work of the Interurban
company and applied for a writ of
mandate to compel the Interurban
company to carry out its agreement.
This, ties up the work until a hearing
pn the matter, or until the third rail
is again laid.
The trouble between the companies
is said to be caused by the Germanla
Trust Company of St. Louis, which is
to purchase $500,000 of the Interurban
company's bonds, objecting to the
agreement both roads entered into. By
the agreement the tracks in question
would be practically under joint own
ership, and the trust company did not
want bonds on such'a line. In order to
secure the money the Interurban com
pany decided to break the agreement.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 25.âBe
cause of the results of the decision of
the Alaskan boundary tribunal/the
Dominion Government has definitely
decided to build an all-Canadian rail
way to the Klondike. This decision
Â¦was announced for the first time in
Vancouver to-day by the Hon. R. G.
MacPherson, M. P., who said:
"You may unreservedly announce
that an all-Canadian road to Dawson
City will be built without loss of time,
the project to be backed by the Do
minion Government. There are three
ways by which the road could be built
and one of these will be adopted at
the next session of the House of Com
mons. According to the plan -of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier and his Cabinet: First,
the Government may guarantee the In
terest on the bonds of the syndicate
building the road; second, a certain
stated bonus may be given to the con
struction company, and third, the Gov
ernment may build the road itself and
operate it as a state undertaking. The
road will start from Kitimat Inlet, on
the Western British Columbia coast,
600 miles north of Vancouver, and will
run through the northern part of the
province, thence down the Y.ukon to
Dawson. The terminus will be no fur
ther north than Kitimat, because the i
Government wishes to keep the line as
far removed as possible " from United
States territory. Construction will
probably start May 1, 1904."

DOUGLAS, Ariz., Nov. 25.â The bor
der bandits, led by Gregorlo Sanchez,
a once wealthy rancher, who recently
raided the town of Bacoachi, in North
ern Sonora, and then fled north across
the American line, have been driven
back into-Sonora by the Arizona rang
ers and officers. They continued their
hurried flight until they reached the
Bacoachi country. The authorities of
that section now have appealed to
Arispe and Cananea, saying that the
bandits are camped in the mountains
Just back of the town. The small
forces at hand are unable to resist the
bandits, who continue their raids In
open defiance of all the rurales and
officers which the place can muster.
When Sanchez and his band* raided
the town and killed his brother-in-law.
Guidino, a 'merchant in the place, it
was thought that the leader had satis
fled his vengeance and would not care
or dare to return. In consequence no
provision was made against a second
attack. It was thought after he
had crossed the line he was gone for
good, but Sanchez evidently knew his
men. He knew the inevitable result of
a meeting with the determined force
of Americans and when he found the
Rangers had taken his trail he slipped
his band back into Sonora by night
marches and then crossed the line just
in time to avoid a flght. Colonel Kos

for five minutes. Going out to sea, the

The point where the dredging, was
commenced to-day and where it will be
continued is along the south channel,
which Is the most narrow section of
the bar. There the obstruction Is less
than , a mile and a quarter wide, and
the real Bhoal or crest of the bar is
about three-eighths of a mile in width.
As it will require about forty minutes
for the Chinook to dredge across the
bar, dump her load at sea and return,
it is expected that five trips can be
made and 10,000 tons of sand taken out
on each tide worked. . . .

history. Shortly before high tide, the
Chinook was -headed across "the bar at
a speed of about six miles per hour.

the shoal, and in that time 487% tons
of sand were pumped into her bins, a
rate of thirty-five tons per minute.

to break the will of Alexander Duns
muir, the Canadian coal king, who
married the petite operatic artiste's
mother, Mrs. Josephine Hopper, in this
city in 1899. The clergyman officiated
at that wedding, which was a very
quiet affair. Besides the principals and
the minister only the two witnesses re
quired by law were present. ,
Dr. Shaw has declined to talk about
the case. His testimony will be taken,
it is expected, on the question of Duns

that her stepfather was mentally in

The ladies' night of Islam Temple of
the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles
of the Mystic Shrine in Native Sons'
Hall last evening was one of the most
delightful and charming functions ever
given by this association. The hall was
most lavishly decorated,- the prevailing
hue being pink, relieved with garlands
of bright green and baskets of ferns.
Over the stage, where the orchestra of
twenty pieces was concealed behind
banks of flowers, was, in electric lights,
the well-known emblem of the order.
The programme was in the -form of a
camel and was a novelty in the way of
a souvenir. There were nearly 500
dancers on the floor, the ladies in ele
gant evening costumes and the gentle
men in full dress suits, each wearing
the red fez. Not a few of the young
ladles wore jaunty white fezes, each
bearing in gold embroidery the name
"Islam."

function was under the direction of the

He now asks that the default Judg
ment be set aside and that he be al
lowed to answer the suit. He claims that
as soon as he heard of the divorce he
set out for Oakland. He was ship
wrecked on the Yukon River and de
layed at St. Michael, but notwithstand
ing the difficulties he is at length la
a position to refute his wife's charges.
A month ago Mrs. Beckwith was
given a default Judgment against her
husband, and the matter was referred
to the Court Commissioner for the pur
pose of taking the evidence. Beckwith
claims that the entire matter has been
conducted through fraud and misrep
resentation, and that only by chance
did he come to know of the action
against him.
Beckwith says he left here last June
for Dawson City, to be gone for six
months. He says hia wife aided him
in his arrangements to leave and wrote
to him during his absence in answer
to letters written by him, but never a
word about the divorce. Thirty day*
after he left the complaint was filed,
she claiming that he failed to provide
for her.

Dr. Herzl, mentioned in the letter, is
a leader of the Zionist movement in
Vienna and presided at the latest con
gress of delegates in August last at
Basle, Switzerland. He read at the
congress a written promise from Min
ister Plebwe, acting for the Russian
Government, that Russia would support
the project to secure a concession from
the Sultan of Turkey for the occupa
tion of Palestine. Dr. Nordau is a fa
mous alienist and pathologist and is a
leader of Zionists in France.
Both men named in the letter ad
vised consideration of another offer to
Zionists for a grant of a tract of 50,000
square miles in a British protectorate
in East Africa for the founding of the
contemplated Jewish hierarchy. This
scheme is now being investigated by
scientific explorers.
In his letter to the Russian Minister
Wiener intimates that Great Britain is
backing Dr. Herzl and Dr. Nordau.
This Is denied by Zionists in this city.
NEW TpRK, Nov. 25.â Here is a
translation of a letter from the secret
archives of M. Plehwe, Minister of the
Interior of Russia. The original, writ
ten in German, bears filing marks and
reference data of the office in St. Pe
tersburg, showing the date of its re
ceipt and the index number of the sub
ject matter:
NEW YORK. Aug. 27. â Excellency:
Several months have gone by since I laid
before his Excellency Count Cassini,
Russian Embassador at Washington, my
views about Rabbinical Judaism and
Zionism and offered him my services to
combat this danger and to disclose this
world swindle. The course of events
must have shown your Excellency how
risrht I was.
"Zionism is a political experiment on
the part of England, and Dr. Herzl and
Dr. Nordau are in English pay. Hav
ing been unsuccessful ip regard to Pal
estine, they have hit upon an exodus to
Africa and the above named leaders are
unscrupulous enough to lead their
brothers to destruction. I have a great
desire to write a whole book about the
business, which would completely justi
fy the conduct of your government, but
without your support I can do nothing,
as his Excellency Count Cassini will
confirm. In all devotion.
WIENER.
As the letter makes plain, an offer ,
is made covertly to supply information
to the Russian Government which may
discredit the Zionist movement and
justify the agents of the Czar in any
attitude they may assume toward
friends of the movement, which has for
its object the re-establishment of the
Jews in a country of their own. In an
interview the writer, under the misap
prehension that he was talking to an
emissary of the Russian Government,
not only made plain that it was his ob
ject to disclose alleged secrets of the
Zionists, which he said he was qualified
to do, but went further toward opening
negotiations for a supply of informa
tion.
Special. Dispatch"' to The Call.
Harriman and party, at the conclu
sion of to-morrow's ceremonies on the
cut-off, will go to the coast, inspecting
the improvements on the Southern
Pacific, especially between Ogden and
Reno. Nev.. long stretches of which
have been practically rebuilt.
"When this work is completed." 6aid
he, "the running time between Salt
Lake and the Pacific Coast will be about
twenty-two hours, and fifteen 'hours
will be about the time between Salt
Lake and Los Angeles when Senator
Clark's road is completed. Incidentally
these improvements have cost a little
money. During the past three years
there has been spent for improvements,
outside of rolling stock, a total of
$15.3.000,000."
At the Alta Club to-night Harriman
spoke briefly concerning the Great Salt
Lake cut-off and also referred to the
improvements made by the Union and
Southern Pacific systems.
The party was Joined at Ogden by
General Manager Julius Kruttschnltt,
General Passenger Agent E. O. Mc-
Cormick of the Southern Pacific and
General Passenger Craig of the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company.
On arriving in Salt Lake the party
was taken by a committee of business
men for a tour of sight-seeing and at
6 o'clock attended a muslcale at the
Tabernacle. The party was given an
informal dinner, at the Alta Club and
the train left for Ogden at 10 o'clock.
The Lucin cut-off will be dedicated at
noon to-morrow.
SALT LAKE, Nov. 25.â President E.
H. Harriman of the Southern Pacific
arrived in Salt Lake on a special train
at 2 o'clock this afternoon. Accom
panying him was a party of prominent
railroad officials of the country, among
them being President Burt of the Union
Pacific, President Farllng of the Mil
waukee, President Wilcox of the Del
aware and Hudson, Vice President
Faithorn of the Chicago and Alton,
Vice President Harahan of the Illinois
Central and General Manager Gardner
of the Chicago and Northwestern and
General Manager Holdredge of the
Burlington and Missouri River Rail
road.
Concerning the Aleuts, who inhabit
the Alaskan peninsula and the adjacent
coast and the Aleutian Islands. General
Funston says that, although he never
visited their country, he is advised that
they are decreasing in numbers, owing
to the spread of tuberculosis, their
fondness for liquor and the hard condi
tions of their life, due to the scarcity of
game.
The Yukon Indians are described to
be in a primitive state, but are honest
and industrious. About the only re
ports of destitution among the natives
of the interior of Alaska, have been re
garding those on Copper river, but his
information was that these Indians
were trifling and worthless.
Concerning the Alaska Eskimo, Gen
eral Funston says, his existence has al
ways been a precarious one, dependent
upon his success in hunting and fish
ing. After the Eskimos obtained
breech-loading rifles from whalers in
the seventies, caribou were slaugh
tered in the most reckless fashion.
There is now. General Funston says, a
certain amount of destitution and occa
sional starvation among the Eskimos
of Bering sea and Kotzebue sound, but
it is duf to conditions which prevailed
years before the miners came to the
shore of Bering sea. The natives all
but exterminated the caribou and also
killed the walrus with the same reck
less regard for the future.
General Funston says that under fa
vorable conditions the reindeer enter

WASHINGTON. Nov. 25.â Brigadier-
General Frederick Funston. command
ing the Department of the Columbia,
has submitted to the Adjutant-General
of the army a report reviewing the re
sults of his investigations of reports of
destitution among natives of Alaska.
General Funston says his investigation
was made in the summer season and
that, as the destitution complained of
occurs only in the winter, the data he
obtained -was mostly from conversation
with traders, missionaries, miners and
other residents of the country. Most
of the natives along the coast of
Alaska. General Funston says, belong
to the Thlinket race. They are Indians,
not Eskimos, and he says there" never
has been any general destitution among
them. But despite their general pros
perity. General Funston says, there are
some discouraging features regarding
their condition, the principal ones being
tuberculosis and liquor.
Seeking an Investment for Alaskan
gold, Evans was induced to take
charge' of Ferndale Springs. Mrs.
Evans wag to have general supervision,
the Misses Evans to care for the com
fort of the guests, while the son was to
drive the bus. The waters, it was rep
resented, he could sell for Jl a gallon.
Evans said that he sold one meal for
35 cents to a traveler who had lost his
way and that represents the income of
the place for several months. He dis
charged the Chinese cook after the first
week and the family tried to even
things up by drinking the $1 a gal
lon water.
Finally Mrs. Evans became sick and
the doctor said it was from drinking
Impure water. A divided reservoir,
from one side of which was said to
come sulphur and from the other
water with the properties of magnesia,
was cleaned out and the spring imme
diately went dry. While there was a
spring on one side, the water had to
be poured into the other, and Evans
stated that his wife had been drinking
water many weeks old. This. satisfied
him, if more proof were needed, that he
had purchased a "gold brick" and he
instituted suit to recover $350 rent paid
out and $1500 damages.
John R. Evans, late lessee of the
Ferndale Springs Hotel, near Martinez,
Contra Costa County, told Judge Mel
vin to-day how it felt to be "mine
host" at a guestless hotel. He rented
the place from Benjamin F. von Ama
range, who, the complainant pleads, rep
resented the place as "a populous cara
vansary in the good, old summer time."
He also told how mineral springs were
made and the public fooled. The stock
of $1 50 whisky that Evans had laid in
he drank himself while waiting for the
summer horde of visitors that failed to
materialize and now Evans wants his
money back.

where he fell, ArchI Kai, a Japanese,
â¢ was discovered to-day, more dead than

Jackson, 1S25 Clinton avenue. He was
removed to the Receiving Hospital in
Oakland, and the surgeons who attend
ed him believe that he has a chance of
recovery. They were" unable to extract
the leaden slug, which plowed through
the nasal bone and lodged close to the
brain. -
Kai was employed at the Jackson
residence for' two weeks. He was first
missed Monday night,, and members of
the household thought that the Japa
nese had become dissatisfied with the
place and left without notice. This
morning Miss Maude Jackson was
alarmed by moans Issuing from the
servants' qparters, and notified the po
lice. Patrolman Theodore Anderson re
sponded, and found Kai lying in his
lodgings, Veak from loss of blood and
unable to help himself. Anderson sent
the injured Japanese to the Receiving
Hospital in the city ambulance. Beside
the wounded man lay a 32-callber six
shooter with one chamber discharged.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Giving force to Mr. Richardson's testimony
Mr. Errrin's explanation of the signing of thla
report by him under the circumstances stated
Mr. Richardson's testimony before me is a
fulj confession that he offered and caused the
delivery of the stock to Beavers and com
pletely exonerates Mr. Erwin frotn any com
plk-ity with these stock transactions.
There Is no act, as far as disclosed by the
testimony, on the part' of Mr. Erwin upon
this trip to Washington, that is. In my opinion.
In itself wrongful. Therefore If the testimony
of Mr Richardson is true there Is no evi
dence 'connecting Mr. Erwin with the con
rplracy as to matters transpiring at that time.
This presents two prepositions: K*m. does
the evidence warrant the conclusion that the
testimony of Mr. Richardson In regard to the
events which transpired upon saM visit Is not
true, that Mr. Erwin did know of such stock
transaction and lent his . Influence to the
furtherance of the same? Second, If the tes
timony does not warrant such conclusion and
Mr. Erwin Is found not guilty of participating
In the alleged conspiracy at that time, does
the testimony show that at some subsequent
time Mr. Erwin. having learned of the un
lawful character of the transactions connected
with the ordering of these device* as afore
said Joined in the conspracy and participated
therein, with the Intent to defraud the United
States? * â¢ â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢
A FULL CONFESSION.
The conspiracy charged had Its Inception,
at least so far as it involved Mr. Machen,
upon this trip to Washington made by Mr.
Richardson and Mr. Erwin In November of
l&O. It vu at that time that the offers of
stork were made to Beavers and Machen. as
appears from the testimony.
In a matter of this nature men do not usually
violate the law without some incentive to do
so by way of personal gain. The acceptance
by Mr. Machen of 1000 shares of stock as
aforesaid presents a direct motive In this case,
and is the only financial consideration shown
by the testimony to have been received by
him in connection with the aforesaid orders
for the device In question.
Although It appears from his own evidence
that he is a co-consplrator with Beavers and
Machen to defraud the Government, whose in
terest as an officer he Is sworn to uphold
and protect, no Indictmnt hangs over him;
he may voluntarily Incriminate himself with
out fear of punishment, while Incriminating
his co-conspirators; since he is ypoesesÂ»ed of
such knowledre and thus free to reveal the
whole truth.
RICHABDSON CHABGED.
In speaking of D. S. Richardson, the
principal witness for the prosecution,
Judge Heacock says:
There is nothing wrongful in Mr. Erwin
taking euch Interest In the device or desiring
to see Its adoption by the Government. These
facts taken alone cannot militate airalnu the
defendant. â¢ â¢ â¢
That Mr. Erwin took a very active Interest
In Mr. Richardson's device, studying its de
tails and making suggestions with a view of
improving the same, and believed the device
to be useful and of great benefit to both the
public and the service, and that he was de
sirous of having the same adopted by the
Government, fully appears by the evidence,
and to such effect is the testimony of the
defendant himself.
Judge Heacock then discusses the in
dictment and expresses the opinion
that the time indicator device is both
useful to the public and of benefit to
the service and adds:
The essential and material <jueÂ«Uon to be
determined Is: What does the evidence dis
close that the defendant Erwin did. or assist
in doing, Â¦with intent to defraud the United
States, that eo Induced Mr. Machen to violate
his official duties by ordering these devices
without previous advertising for bids as afore
said? â¢ â¢ â¢
CASE BITTERLY PROSECUTED.
The opinion occupies about S000
words and enters exhaustively into a
discussion of the testimony. The fol
lowing are extracts:
I have patiently examined and considered
the evidence submitted in this cause ar.d the
more so because, on the one hand, of the In
sistence and vigorous prosecution of the United
States Attorney and as appears in his brief
filed before me. the Attorney General's urgent
request that the defendant bÂ» held for trial,
and also, as appears in evidence, the yummary
dismissal of the defendant from office; and
upon the other, lest by my decision I do an
Injustice to the defendant, who. it appears,
has been a trusted officer of the Government
for upward of fifteen years, and wl.ose char
acter has been hitherto, as admitted by the
United States Attorney, without reproach.
The defendant was visibly affected
when Judge Heacock. toward the close
of his lengthy opinion, pronounced the
words that made him a free man. Mr.
Erwin's friends crowded around him,
shook his hand and congratulated him.
United States Court Commissioner
Heacock yesterday rendered his decis
ion in the matter of the removal of
James W. Erwin to "Washington to
stand trial on an indictment charging
conspiracy with W. W. Machen and
August Beavers to defraud the Govern
ment by selling to it the Montague-
Richardsdn time - indicator for letter
boxes.
Commissioner Heacock decided that
Erwin was innocent of the charges and
discharged him.
BUTTE, Mont., Nov. 25.â Captain Roo
ney, a well-known pioneer in Montana, is
dead in St James Hospital, where he
has been lying for two months, suffering
from the effects of a severe beating at the
hands of robbers who trfed to steal from
him the proceeds of a mine sale. Captain
Rooney participated in the famous battle
of the Merrimae and Monitor, being on
the Confederate ironclad.
Victim of Brutal Bobbers.
I cannot hold the defendant on the as
sumption that there Is other evidence which
was presented to the Grand Jury or la In pos
resslon of the Government, which. If the same
had been adduced before me. would have been
sufficient. I find that there Is not sufficient
reason to believe the defendant guilty of the
offense complained of and order him dis
charged.
While Mr. Erwin did receive 500 shares of
stock. I do not flnd that such stock was re
ceived for any unlawful acts on his part, or
that the *amÂ« was out of proportion to the
services Mr. Erwin rendered to the company,
if the same were given without knowledge of
the fraud or Intent to defraud the Govern
ment. â¢ â¢ â¢
EARNED THE SHARES.
For some reason, by wMch. In the opinion
of the prosecuting officers, the ends of pub
lic Justice would best be subserved, Mr. Rich
ardson was not indicted in connection with
the alleged conspiracy. It would seem that
this reascn can be none other but that the
Government expects by the testimony of Mr.
Richardson to prove the charges against the
other alleged conspirators. In view of these
circumstances and that Mr. Richardson Is free
to tell the whole truth In regard to all these
matters. I do not feÂ«I Justified in discrediting
hl.< testimony in regard to the most vital cir
cumstances in this case, and I can reach no
other conclusion but that Mr. Erwin was not
concerned at the time of his visit to Wash
ington in the Inducements held out to Mr.
Machen which caused him to violate his offi
cial dutlÂ»s by ordering these devices in vio
lation of the regulations of the department.
I do not find in the evidence sufficient 'reason
to believe that after that time Mr. Erwin
became a party to the conspiracy. I flnd n/>
evidence of any Incentive or overtures made
by Mr. Erwin to Mr. Machen. or any act on
th* part of Mr. Erwin that was Intended to
Induce him to violate the duties of his office,
or that, 'With Intent to defraud the United
States, Mr. Erwin assisted others in further
ing this conspiracy or Inducing Mr. Machen
to violate his official duties r.s aforesaid.
PROSECUTOR NOT INDICTED.
and his want of knowledge as to some of the
matters contained therein- appears to me to
te reasonable. â¢ â¢ â¢
- PAID FOB SERVICES. .
-, Mr - Erwin states that he understood the
nrty snares in the original companv were given
to htm for suggested improvements in the
oevlce and Mr. Richardson's testimony Is to
the same effect. Upon thf~ urbanization of
the new company the capital stock was In
creased from 20,000 shares to 40,000 shares
and Mr. Erwln was given 100 shares In lieu of
his fifty shares in the old compuny.
ThÂ«? 50O shares voted to him after the re
organization. Mr. Erwin states that he was
also told were given to him for the suggested
improvements in the device; that he never
a*ked for any stock: that his. services were
riven purely as a' matter of friendship for
Mr. Richardson, and that the 500 shares were
offered to him and ' he accepted the same.
There was no concealment as to the stock
given Mr. Erwin, or that criven to Mr. Thrall
who. it appears was als>o riven 500 shares.
It docs not appear what services were ren
dered by Mr. Thrall, who Is also connected
with the Po6toffice Department in advancing
the interests of the company, and there Is no
contention that the stock voted to him was
for any influence in connection with these
contract*. While it appears that Mr. Erwin
had taken a very active interest in Mr. Rich
ardson's Invention, and had put himself to
inconvenience at Mr. Richardson's request to
KCUrfl the adoption of this device by the Gov
ernment, if his actions were Innocent In re
pard to the adoDtion of said device by the
Government I see nothing unreasonable In It
self in the presenting: of this stock to Mr.
Erwin for his services to the company.
Richardson's testimony before me is a full
confession that he alone, without the assist
ance of Mr. Erwin. offered the stock and
caused t^e delivery of the same to Beavers
ani Machen. and throughout the evidence in
this case he substantially corroborates the tes
timony of the defendant.
new development in criminology he
puts a new attachment on his safe to
protect it against the designs of the in
ventive safe-crackers. On the night of
November 21, which Avas last Saturday,
the inventor drew six days' wages as
a fresco artist and went out in the by
ways to find new criminals to gain in
formation for the further protection of
his burglar-proof safe. On Kearny
street, he said, he met three men whom
he knew for safe-crackers. In company
with them he went to an opium place
at 522% Pine street, where he hoped to
have them,divulge new secrets in regard
to electrical drills and other matters
that have followed in the wake of crim
inal scientific Investigation. When he
came out of the hop Joint several hours
afterward he discovered that the sup
posed safe-crackers also knew how to
filch from a well-guarded pocket. He
was a loser $33, which he had failed to
protect with one of his burglar devices.
He told a policeman his troubles and
the "hoo. Joint" was raided. Charles
Bacigalupi was the only one of the
smokers whom the Inventor could even
partly identify, and he was taken into
custody on the charge of robbery.
Judge Mogan listened to the story in
extenso and intimated that the com
plaining witness' story "sounded off
pitch to him," and then drifted off into
humming, a popular tune. Bacigalupi's
record will be looked up, and if it is
not entangled with the criminal history
of the world as set forth in the police
records he will be told to go his way
in the paths of rectitude.
Judge Mogan stood forward on the
outward battlements of his judicial
castle yesterday and ba> v led a warning
to those who take advantage of a party,
telephone line to abuse their .neigh
bors. Emma Brandt v.-as the defend
ant in the case and she lives at Jones
and Vallejo streets. Whenever ,-s.he
found that MrsT^Whalen, who llves^at
518 Vermont street, was trying to com
municate with the butcher, the baker
or the candlestick-maker she would
pull the telephone off the hook and
pour forth a flood of vindictiveness
that would appal the Whalen house
hold. From the testimony the Judge
concluded" that Emma Brandt was
guilty, and he told her: "The mean
est and most cowardly manner of
aration is abuse over a telephone. The
present charge, against you has been
proved to my satisfaction, but I feel
that you are entitled to a postponement
of thirty days. In the meantime if any
proof is presented to me that you have
resumed your' abuse over the telephone
I will be compelled to inflict a severe
penalty."
The preliminao' hearing of Police
man Joseph Fell for the murder of his
father-in-law, Fritz Dirking, on the
night of November 3, occupied the en
tire attention of Judge Fritz's court
yesterday. Among the witnesses was
a son of the slaughtered man, who tes
tified on cross-examination that he had
secured a revolver and endeavored to
kill Fell during the course of his inva
sion of the home. From the trend of
the questions asked on cross-examina
tion it was apparent that Fell intends
to introduce self-defense as an excuse
for manslaughter.
The San Francisco retail grocers have
secured the backing of the Board of
Trade, the MiMmen's Association and
the Wholesale Grocers' Association In
their movement against trading
stamps. As a result they report that
all their members and most of the few
grocers who are not members of their
organization have given up the use of
this peculiar system, against which the
merchants are warring.
The retail grocers have asked the co
operation of the Merchants' Association
in a letter, in which they say that the
customers who collect trading stamps
r'>y a very high price for what they
think they are getting for nothing. The
Merchants' Association has taken the
matter up, and the ultimate result may
be that the merchants of this city, as
in Oakland, will give up the use of
trading stamps. The letter of the gro
cers is as follows:
Merchants' Association of San Franciscoâ
Gentlemen: ThiÂ» organization fcaa taken up a.
movement which Is In line with similar move
ments all over the United States. There is
Y...- :~.y a community In this country but that Is
differing from the Infection cf trading stamps.
This is a device Tchich savors largely of black
mail. 6ince it forces merchants to fpend money
ttalr.st their will lor wbich they secure no ade
quate return or imposes upon them the necessi
ty r,f uÂ«:n* tome other premium scheme, all of
which art very expensive.
While this echeme co^tf far more than it Is
worth to retail merchants. It also costs far
more than it Is worth to consumers.
When only a few dealers gave stacsps they
possessed enough of advertising value to trar
rar.t tiie merchants counting this expenditure
t .- advertising expense.
When the ure of trading stamps and other
premium pchenies induced by trading stamps
twijne general, their value In drawing trade
Â¦was lost. The merchants using them found It
reefssary to advance their prices. This ad
vance i* usually enough not only to cover the
cost cf .the e.tair.ps â which in ecme stores is
over J"..v> per month â but also to give the dealer
a profit on his investment. In this way the
consumer, who has filled a book with 1000
stamps, for which the dealer has paid the
trading stamp company $5. has paid the dealer
fer in excess of $5 lor the stamps. But they
find en going to the trading stamp company
that they are entitled to a cheap vase worth
cbout 11 75, cr seme other similar article cf
â¢Fuch evident cheap value that the stamp col
>^tor is usually disappointed at her own fooi
!Â«hr.ees in wasting the time she has been de
iÂ»ye<" in waiting for clerks to give her stamps
WÂ« explain this matter fully because we feel
that the members of the Merchants" Associa
tion owe it not only to themselves, but to the
city of Ban Francisco to lead the weight of
their ir2uer.ee and resources to a movement
to rlfl the city cf this pest which Is hurtful to
all who are concerned with It in any way
*>xcppt the clever schemers who make use of
it to grow wealthy at the expense of the ren
ersl public.
our organization has undertaken the move
tr.fr.t to secure the abandonment of trading
ttarr.ps trees* the retail grocers. We havÂ«
progressed very satisfactorily. "vVe feel how
ever, that the permanency cf our success de
pends upon our being able to render It un
profitable for the trading stamp companies to
continue In business in San Francisco
This can only be dene if merchants of all
elates g:ve up the use of trading stamps as
they have done In Oakland since the machine"

During the interval that the youth
and the burglar stood eying each
other, however, the youth was enabled
to gather a good description of the fel
low.
"He wore gold-rimmcd eyeglasses, a
brown coat and trousers, with stripes
up and down and cross-wise," said
young Morgan, "and I got a good look
at his face, so that I think I would
recognize him if I saw him again. He
wore a red beard, but I think it was
false because the rest of his hair was
brown. He had a derby hat on his
head and white tennis shoes on his feet,
so that he wouldn't make any noise."
The burglar carried with him when
he jumped out of the window a silver
watch and a Berkeley High School pin,
but in his Hisht he dropped the watch.
This was afterward found hanging on
a rose bush in the garden. So that all
the burglar got for his trouble was the
pin.
This is the second time the Morgan
home, of which George W. Morgan is
the head. ha3 been robbed within eight
days. A burglar entered the house last
Tuesday night while the family was at
dinner and carried away some $800
worth of valuables.
The burglary to-day was committed
while there were seven people in the
house. Mr. Morgan was taking a nap
downstairs, one of the three Misses
Morgan was in her own room upstairs,
and the other two were going about
downstairs, the two younger boys were
downstairs too, attending to various
duties. The Japanese cook was in the
kitchen. Nobody suspected the pres
ence of a burglar in the house, particu
larly so soon after the robbery of a
week ago.
George C. Morgan, t a youth of 12
years, came upon a burglar a.t work in
an UDStalrs room of his home at 2326
Cottage avenue at 3:30 o'clock this aft
ernoon. The youth and burglar saw
each other at the same time and each
was so frightened for a moment that
he did not move. The burglar gath
ered his wits first, however, and hurry
ing to a window let himself down by
means of the veranda , uprights and
hurried off. By the time young Mor
gan had alarmed the other members of
the household there was no burglar In
sight. . '

When William Coffey was called be
fore Judge Cabaniss on the charge of
drunkenness yesterday morning, and
the arresting officer testified that Wil
liam -was disturbing the peace of pedes
trians on Kearny street, the defendant
said he was perfectly sober. "I had
only taken about a dozen drinks," said
fhe. defendant, "and .that would even
start me."
â' "It doesn't particularly matter to me,"
said the modern philosopher, "whether
you had taken one drink or twenty. In
Police Courts we are greatly hedged
around by statutory provisions in dis
position of cases. I believe the charge
against you should be that of disturb
ing the peace. However, it would be
exceedingly difficult and expensive to
the taxpayers of this city and county
to summon before this court all of the
men and women you disturbed on
Kearny street after you had taken only
twelve drinks. Accordingly I will find
you guilty of being drunk and commit
you to the County Jail for three
months. When a man has drunk too
much he is drunk, and should realize
it and find some place to sleep It off
without annoying those who are more
careful In their indulgences."

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
SPJQWW for WOMEN
WHO CANNOT BB CURED.
Backed up by over a third of a century
of remarkable and ' uniform cures, a
record such as no other remedy for the
diseases and weaknesses peculiar to
women ever attained, the proprietors of
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription now
feel fully warranted in offering to pay
I500 in legal money of the United
States, for any case of Leucorrhea, Fe-
male Weakness, Prolapsus, . or Falling
of Womb which they cannot cure. All
they ask is a fair and reasonable trial of
their means of cure.
The Vice-president Independent Order
of Good Templars.
An experience which many women have was
related by Miss Ae-aes Stebbings, of 231 East
30th Street, New York City, aa follows: "I
had verv poor health for a year until life
looked dark aad dreary to me. Had head-
cches. . backache, also paia. my deep was
broken asd fitful. I longed for health. Tried
several medicines bat none were of any last-
ing benefit until I took Doctor Pierce's Fa-
vorite Prescription. I . soon realized that I
had found the right reaedy. It helped nature
to throw off the poisons that saturated the
system, removed ail pains and strengthened
the digestive organs, and brought the roses of
health back: to my cheeks. This medicine if
taken occasionally keeps the system in perfect-
condition, helping it to throw off the disease
and consequences of exposure to dampness. I '
am pleased to give it my endorsement."

that she did not go to her mother's

$66, Auditor Baehr yesterday withheld
payment of a demand in favor of the
company for $70 68 for electric current
furnished the Fire Department corpo

a charter provision that "no demand
shall be allowed by the Auditor with
out first deducting the amount of any
indebtedness of which he has notice."
Smith says that the Pacific .'Gas'Im
provement Company, v which was ab
sorbed by the San .Francisco. company,
refused to pay license for the quarter
beglnningOctober 1 on the ground that
it is now under a different: manage

willing to pay its own license, , but
Smith, holds that; license for the Pa

The protest against the paving of
Clay street, from Cherry to First ave

was sustained.
Rev. * Father Mulligan, ' secretary to
Archbishop ' Rlordan, appeared before
the board and urged that the permit
for a spur track on Filbert street be
granted to connect the Gibraltar ware
house with, the belt road. The board
refused to grant the \ permit, because
the Labor Council has filed a protest
against the privilege being granted by
the Board of Supervisors.
% Through the generosity of property
owners on H street, from Forty-fifth to
Fortyeighth avenues; in Oceanslde,
the city will he saved- an - expenditure
of $2,500 for grading the three blocks
described. Petition had been made '.to
the Board of 'Works by Sol-Getz and
others to grade the street, ; ; but they
were .informed that there were no
funds available to grade the city's por
tion 1 ,- the .cost .of which was estimated
by the City Engineer at $2,600. ' : ;/
\ At . yesterday's meeting" of ,the /board
Getz 1 stated that the . entire;- expense
would be* borne by the property own

G. F. Chapman, general . manager, of

against the proposed change of grade

Chflpman said the proposed maximum
grade, of 5.42, per cent will, make it'inf
practicable 'to; operate cars* with the

gave the corporation one year's time to

The contract includes subsequent ap
plications of oil and the maintenance
of .the roadway for a period 'of three

Regarding the abolishing of sidewalk
widths; on Sixteenth street, easterly
from Seventh, the City Engineer recom
mended that those on the southerly
side of the street be fixed at eight feet.
In' the Southern Pacific franchise bill
now .before the Supervisors it Is pro
vided that the outer edge of a viaduct
on -the north side of Sixteenth street,
between Seventh and Illinois streets, is
to conform to the official curb line
thereof. The roadway, of
Sixteenth street cannot be widened on
the northerly side without further con
cessions are made by the company and
other property o\vner3 along the street.
Arrangements have been made to se
cure the widening of both Kentucky

quired. Grunsky says It would be well
to extend the proposed . widening of.

Pierce saidthat he and a former dep
uty poundkeeper. F. Dantz, who had
previously given damaging, evidence
against Irwin, had divided money for
releasing cattle on the road and no
receipts had been given. Pierce said
that Irwin was unaware of the wrong
doing.
Irwln was put on the stand In his
own defense, and testified that he had
not received any money from M. Marty
for releasing twenty- three cattle be
longing to. the latter. Irwin said A.
Kenny had" told him he was going to
drive Marty's cattle into his own field
in order to get damages from. Marty.
Irwin said he issued unofficial receipts
as duplicates of the official receipts and
he turned ail the money he received
Into the city treasury/ He said he did
not ' know he' was violating the law
when he issued unofficial receipts, but
had discontinued the practice since the
beginning of the' investigation.

of animals at the request of Abe Ruef

Brandensteln's question as to whether
he was not violating his duties as
poundmaster in so doing. Brandensteln
said the fact that Irwln had refused

IS UNDER FIRE
The f oer was dense and the captain
could see nothing and could barely
hear the fog bell on An gel Island. Th e
ship was running at half speed at th*
time, otherwise the mishap would hav?
heen far more serious. Â»â¢ - TÂ«?>
. Captain Lucky has been in command
of the Sausallto for a year and & half
and has been commanding different
vessels In the harbor for the last thirty
three years. He was at the helm at the
time the accident took place.
Bolles and Bulger, the .United States
Inspectors of steam. vessels, will make
a full and complete inquiry Into . the
cause of the mishap and the manage
ment of. the North Shore Railroad will
also institute a careful and searching
investigation to try to ascertain' the
cause of the accident, which might
have caused serious loss of life, and
also the possibility of the destruction
of the vessel herself. The Cazadero and
the TamalDais will be in commission
during the time the Sausalito Is under
going repairs.
COTTLD BARELY HEAR BELL.
The vessel's rudder and sternpost
were twisted awav like a pipe stem,
while thirty feet of her keel Is smashed
into splinters and her dead wood looks
like a bunch- .of kindling wood. She
was only leaking slightly. The repairs
will probably necessitate her being on
the ways for. a week at least. A con
servative estimate of the damages
would be 510,000.
Captain John Metcalfe. Lloyd's ma
rine surveyor, was on hand when the
vessel was pulled out of the water and
gave orders that all the damaged por
tions be stripped away.
Captain Lucky reiterates the state
ment that he saw a scow in his way
and was compelled to suddenly change
his course to starboard and that when
he had passed the obstacle he changed
his course back to port. In the mean
time he thinks he "was struck by' the
heavy tides that run In that channel
and he thinks his vessel must have
taken a sheer that he did not calcu
late on. Â£?,aÂ»Â»
DAMAGE IS $1O,OOO.
It took exactly fifteen minutes to haul
her out of the water after the props
to the ways had been adjusted. Upon
examination it was found that she had
been ; far more seriously Injured .than
was at first supposed. Instead of run
ning into the sand, as was reported,
it appears from her damaged state that ,
she must have struck rocks, and it is^
not at all surprising that the passen
gers rebelled when they heard that the
captain intended to back her off- and
start for Sausalito. ... ".__

While on his way here the Viceroy of

He made a significant speech, reaffirm
ing Uje intention of Great Britain to
maintain her- supremacy in the Per
sian Gulf, and declared the Government
adhered to its policy of guardianship
and protection of the chiefs. The Vice
roy reminded the chiefs of their en
gagements not to enter into agreements
cr correspondence with any other power
than Great Britain, not to admit agents
of any other government and not to
alienate any part of their territory. . If
the chiefs adhered to these engage
ments, as they had done in the past,
no one would be allowed to tamper with
their rights and liberties. The Viceroy
concluded with emphasizing that the
influence - of the British Government,
which' maintained the. independence of
the chiefs and made the gulf- secure to
the. ships of all nations, must remain
supreme. t -

to have alienated Vlasto's affections
and to have damaged Mrs. Vlasto to

more, than merely take a defensive at
titude was made plain to-day by her
attorney, who. represents her in her
action for divorce against Dr. Cutvir
and has for a long time been Senator
Clark's counsel In this city. _ . i

her .brothers and her husband all call
him' "Unc!e Solon,' K or "Uncle yiAsto,'*
and < he, Is on terms of friendship and

and make himself generally useful and
agreeable and he helped Mrs. Culver to
entertain her friends. He knew he was
welcome In Mrs. Culver's home on this
account and he doubtless was glad Of
the opportunity to meet many agree
able people there. He was so well known
to Senator Clark and so well liked by

SAN DIEGO. Nov. 25.-It is among
the possibilities that the franchise
asked for by the San Diego Union Rail
way and Steamship Company may not
be accepted. The reason for. the dec
lination on the part of the petitioners
is found In the fact that the Harbor
Commission does not propose to give a
wharf franchise for a longer period than
the length of time that the present
franchises have to run. The youngest
franchise lasts for five years more and
as new applicants come in the fran
chises arc made to expire at the same
time. The terminal company proposes
to expend several thousand dollars In
the construction of its wharves and Its
officers say they cannot afford to put in
the wharf if assured of its use for only
five . years.

Newlands, . in defending his resolu
tion for Cuban statehood, said that
Cuba was to be invited to become a
State of the American republic on
terms of equality with other , States
and that the question was to be de
cided by the people of Cuba by popu
lar vote. " He suggested that the ques
tion of statehood, becoming a military
dependency or an Independent sov
ereign government could be si/bmitted
to the people. ;
Concerning the financial arrange
ments for the island which could be
made If the island entered the repub
lic as a State, Newlands said that the
proposed, bond issue .of J35.000.000 for
the payment of Cuba's army of freer
dom should be reduced in Interest from
5 to 3 per cent and guaranteed by the
United States. Thi3 plan would enable
the sale of the bonds at par, thus sav
ing the proposed discount of 10 per
cent, aggregating. $3,500,000, and a sav
ing in Interest of $700,000 annually,
amounting in forty years, the life of
the bonds, to $28,000,000.
Newlands said that union would
mean free trade, without the payment
of the American duty now paid on Cu
ban sugar, and Cuba would annually
receive $35.000,000 , more for her sugar
than at present. All of . this, he
claimed, would mean unexampled pros
perity for Cuba, as well as the unparal
leled dignity and liberty of a State.
The first speech on the merits of the
Cuban bill was made by Carmack (D.)
of Tennessee, who opposed the bill and
said that nothing less than general
tariff revision would give the relief
needed.- There was further debate be
tween Hale (R.) of Maine, Teller (D.)
of Colorado and Newlands on the New
lands resolution, in which Newlands
further outlined his views, and Hale
deprecated all agitation on the subject.
Teller declared that Cuba, was in no
sense a dependency of the , United
States. â¢ â¢

ate to-day completed the appointment

The report states that the regular es
tablishment coast artillery consists of
125 companies of an aggregate m,axi
mum strength of 525 officers and 13,734
men. General Randolph believes it to
be essential to efficiency in war times
that the regular coast artillery estab
lishment be ultimately increased to 751
officers and about 22,000 enlisted men
for existing armament. General Ran
dolph says it is a problem how to se
cure efficient support by the militia in
the mobilization of the coast defenses.
"The chief of artillery," the report
adds, "is fully alive to the necessity ana
desirability of fixing the relations of the
organized militia to the coast artillery'
for the manning of the coast defenses,
and anticipates the development of
marked efficiency in the militia and a
corresponding sense of satisfaction and
security in the artillery corps as soon
as these relations are established. 1 It
Is believed that the militia can find Its

WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.â A Etrong
picture of conditions in the Jolo group
of the Philippine archipelago is con
tained in a letter from Colonel H. L.
Scott. Governor of that group, to Col
onel Clarence Edwards, chief of the
insular bureau of the War Department.
The letter, which is dated September 23,
is made public as an explanation of the
campaign now waging In the Jolo
group. In It the writer says:
I find that the condition is one of
peace so long as the big Moro chiefs are
tllowed to have their own way unre
p-rvedly â to rob and to steal and en
slave. The Sultan is a man of no power
of his own and must depend on the
chiefs, who may or who may not do
what he wishes. They are all surround
ed by gangs of ruffians who do no useful
work but who live through robbery and
by fining both sides in a case, irrespect
ive of who may be guilty, the full
amount of their ability to pay. If the
victim refuses to pay he is enslaved. No
peace or order can be maintained In the
Philippine islands so lone as these con
ditions exist. Movable property is al
ways on the move without the desire of
the owner; men say they will not work
aiid accumulate property which they
will not be permitted to enjoy, and there
are constant turmoils, murders and en
slavements going on.
No one is allowed to go beyond the
outposts here without an armed guard
and it is even advisable to go about the
streets here armed on account of Jura
mentados, one of whom got through the
gate past a sentinel about four days ago
with his arms, ran through the barrack
yard, slashed a soldier across the back
and fell dead on the main plaza. and in
front of the commissary office, shot
seven times by a fusillade from our sol
diers, which killed also a trumpeter
who was g-ctting ready for guard duty.

Under ordinary circumstances the

light ship was keeping an all-night
watch for the Cedric, but up to 11
o'clock she had not been sighted.
KIDNAPED CHINESE GIRL
BEING HELD FOB RANSOM
NEW YORK, Nov. 25. â The report
that the Cedric had been lost created
the wildest excitement in this city and
hardly had it gone abroad before the
White Star officials were besieged by
anxious inquirers. There are in all 290
saloon, 160 sect J cabin and 540 steer
age passengers on board the liner, and
friends and relatives of these who
heard the report that tne vessel had
been sunk in midocean by collision with
the Titian dropped everything else to
make agitated inquiries as to the safety
â¢of the ship and her many voyagers.
Manager Lee of the White Star line
did all he could to reassure anxious
callers and pointed out how well nigh
impossible It was that there could be
any truth in the report. But it was
not until the cables brought positive
news to the Maritime Exchange that
the Titian had arrived out and that
not only had she not been in collision
with the Cedric. but had not seen her
at all, that the tension was relieved. -.
A glance at the plan of the steam
ship's hull, showing _ the numerous
water-tight compartments, is enough to
reassure any one, particularly as one
cannot find there any section where an
injury would not be locally confined.
LIVERPOOL, Nov. 25.â A rumor was
circulated in this city on Sunday last
to the effect that the White Star
steamer Cedric had been sunk in mid
ocean in collision with the Lamport-
Holt steamship Titian. As a careful
investigation showed that the report
could not be tracejl to any responsible
source, little heed was paid to it.
The steamship Titian arrived in due
course of time off the Irish coast yes
terday. She was reported at the Head
of Kinsale and- gave no signal to in
dicate any important experience during
her voyage. This morning she arrived
in the Morsey and proceeded through
the Manchester Canal to Manchester,
her destination. Her owners, as well
as the White Star steamship officials,
all ridicule the story of the rumored
collision. They denounce it as the in
vention of an irresponsible news
agency.
JOLO ISLANDS
IN A BAD WAY
BERLIN, Nov. 25.â Emperor William
has changed his voice, modulating it
so as to reduce the pressure on the
vocal chords. He now speaks in a
somewhat lower pitch, his utterances
resonating against the cavities of the
mouth. He has not trained himself
fully and he may take the services of
a teacher so that he can appjy cor
rectly the method taught in voice cul
ture. His throat specialists have ex
plained to him the theory of voice pro
duction, which he has practiced with
considerable success. The EmperoT
heretofore has been using his larynx
in the ordinary fashion; that is, ex
pelling the air against the chords with
out counter pressure produced by a re
bound from the resonating cavities.
It will be possible, when the Em
peror's voice is trained completely, for
him to speak easily, more- clearly and

* Â» *
What 1 refer to Is the feeling on the
part of the husband that the money he
earns is his, and that each penny he
doles out to his wife is given In the
light of a benefaction, and to the idea
of many a wife that she is a far better
Judge than her husband as to the per
centage of his income. he can afford to
give her.
The idea of business partnership
alone can keep this particular serpent
from the domestic Eden; can prevent
the harmonious menage from degener
ating at times Into the discord of a
menagerie.
By this I do not mean the slenderness
of the family purse, which enforces
mutual economy. In cases of that sort
true lovers are often drawn far more
closely together than were they multi
millionaires.
Another rock whereon many a good
ly married partnership has come to
grief is the subject of money.' I truly
believe that the greatest drawback to
married happiness between persons
who love and trust each other Is lack
of money.

Fax more does it wear down both
nagger and naggee In the married
"firm."
The sooner husband and wife learn
that it is better to waive a point than
to carry that point through a storm of
tears and in the face of a blast of hot
temper the sooner will real conjugal
happiness dawn for both.
It is hard to understand why the
early fathers did not enlarge the list of
seven deadly sins to eight, in order to
include nagging. Perhaps because the
example of Samson's fall through much
nagging was then so much fresher in
the people's minds as to render a sepa
rate warning on the subject less neces
sary than now. It is a sin that brings
its own punishment. Note Kipling's
warning to his countrymen, who are
prone to nag and worry the Hindu:
For the Christian riles
And the Aryan smiles.
And it. weareth the Christian down.
If" two people truly love each other
mere difference of opinion on a few â or
many â subjects is no bar to happiness.
The little differences of opinion amount
to no real difference, and with a tactful
hand at the helm it is easy to steer
around the rocks. These rocks are,
after all, usually nothing more formid
able than pebbles.
True marriage should be a joint part
nership, in which "the party of the first
part" and "the party of the second
part" should (as in regular business
firms) be permitted to do as he or she
pleases, allowing r to the other member
of the firm the same privilege, so long
as neither does anything to endanger
that firm's strength and integrity.
Two men who enter business partner
ship do not quarrel daily as to which
shall rule. There is no question of su
periority or mastery. There is equality
and the harmony that nothing but
equality can bring. Nagging, too, is a
conspicuously absent 'quantity in the
equation. Were two men to plunge
into endless disputes as to which was
really the ruler, and were they to seek
to win each point by nagging, such a
firm might, with rare good luck, endure
for "one consecutive day."
Yet husband and wife who resort to
the same unpleasant tactics are expect
ed to remain as one until "death them
do part."
It is essential if they would avoid
misery that married "partners" should
remember that If a thing cannot be had
without nagging it would better not be
had at all; that when two people mar
ry neither merges forever all individu
ality, but that both still have an in
alienable right to their own ideas, be
liefs and opinions; that it is a mistake
to try to force each other into any ac
quiescent state* of mind.
â¢ * â¢
For only by following out the con
tract idea and the partnership clause
therein implied can marital happiness
be made certain and permanent.
Sentiment in married life is very
beautiful. Without it such life is like
scng woA without music. But when
sentiment ignores businesslike manage
ment of domestic life it lapses from
sentiment (which is the essence of love)
Into sentimentality (whose first letter
is i's only connecting bond with "san
ity").
Despite a halo of veils, orange blos
soms, vows of devotion, Lohengrin pro
cessionals, Mendelsohn recessionals and
"The Voice that Breathed O'er Eden"
as a voluntary, the marriage service is
as much a business contract as is one
formally drawn up in a dingy office and
decked with red seals , and sprinkled
with dreary references to "the party of
the first part" and "the party of the
secend part."
Nor does the marriage state lose one
iota if its solemnity and beauty by be
fng a business contract instead of a
mere go.den thread of very fragile and
fragible love" vows. '
All the sentiment in the world does
not mask the fact that marriage is a
contract.

Marriage a Partnership.
For instance, the thought of food or
the eating of food causes an increase
in the caliber of the blood vessels
(arteries) going to the stomach. This
Increase means more blood to the part,
and the glands of the stomach, which
produce the gastric juice from the
blood, receiving more blood, be
gin to pour out their fluid. It
is estimated that the amount of gastric
Juice bo poured out is usually not less
than ten quarts a day. The quantity
of FHliva is probably from one to two
quarts, an?l that of intestinal Juice,
while not exactly known, is probably
quite equal to the amount of gastric
Juice. Then there is the bile, of which
there is produced from the blood from
one to two quarts. All this fluidâ
about five gallonsâ Is withdrawn from
the blood and returns into the blood
These fixed fluids, however, are much
less important and much less interest
ing than the fluids which fluctuate
through the body. Of these the one
most essential to all the life processes
is the blood. The blood is the center
of all activities of the body. Into the
blood enter the oxygen from the lungs
an<* the digested food, while out of the
blood are filtered the other fluids or the
material from which they are made.
The total amount of blood is about one
eighth of the body weightâ that is,
about eighteen pints (nine quarts) in a
person weighing 144 pounds. The blood,
while in constant motion from before
birth to death, varies somewhat in its
distribution. As a general thing it may
be said that of all the blood in the
body one-fourth is in the heart and
great blood tubes near the heart, one
fourth in the muscles, one-fourth in
the liver and one-fourth in the rest of
the body. By a marvelously beautiful
and complex arrangement of the. ner
vous system the caliber of the blood
vessels is regulated in accordance with
the requirements of the system.
Through the action of the nervous sys
tem the arteries (blood vessels) of the
part used or to be used are increased
in diameter. By this increase in cali
ber the part receives more blood, and
the glands (which are merely filters)
have more material out of which to

Two interesting fluids are the tears
and the meibomian fluid of the eye. The
lachrymal fluid (or tears) is produced
and stored up in two little. glands, one
on the inner Fide of each-eyeball. If any
foreign substance lodges in the eye the
pland is informed of the fact by a deli
fate telegraphic arrangement, and a
flow of tears is poured out for the pur
pose of dislodging the intruder. The
apparatus as a whole is one of the most
delicate and beautiful in the body.
The meibomian fluid is formed by a
system of t;ny plands situated on the
under surface or the eyelids. On the
upper lid there are about thirty of these
glands, while the lower lid contains al
most as many. The ducts of these
glands open on the inner edges of the
eyelids ar"l pour forth fluid which pre
vents the lids from adhering, to each
other or to the eyeball.
There is perhaps no fact about the
human body so surprising to him who
bears it for/ the first l;me a? that the
body is practically a sack of circulating
fluids. A man weighing 150 pounds
contains about 110 pounds of \vater,
most of which is combined with other
elements to form ;:^lui~s thicker and
heavier than water. If the weight" of
the water, then, in th<Â». human body is
nearly three-quarters of the total
weight, the wtlght cfOthe fluids of
which that water is a part is considera
bly greater. We may mention, for in
stance, that nearly half of the blood, by
weight, consists of solid matters, the
cells, and that the blood as a whole \%
from 5 to S per cent heavier than water.
Still more interesting^ the fluids of the
body are all in constant motion. 'The
body is a. collection of fluids all moving
in tides round and round, back and
forth, in and out. All these fluids are
manufactured in the body mainly by
the glands, the work oL which will be
described in a forthcoming article.
Rome in smail quantities; some are used
up quickly, others are so slaw in being
used up an i replenished that they may
be called "the fixed fluids." Some of
the tides in the body's fluids move like
Niagara; others like a glacier.
Of the fluids o', the body about
twenty-five have been reeogrrzed and
studied. That there are more than this
we know; how many rnore we do not
know. There has been discovered- quite
recently a new fluid (the -adrenoxin" of
Sajous), knowledge of which elucidates
many physiologic operations hitherto
but imperfectly understood. ,-
In a general way the. fluids of the;
body may be divided into t*e fÂ»xed and
the tidal. This distinction is. in reality,
quite arbitrary; for tue_fixeJ fluids are
always slowly dying arid passing out of
the body, -.vhile at the same time 'they
are being constantly renewed. Among
these 'â¢fixed* fluids may be mentioned
ihe serous. In many places in the body
there are surfaces which constantly
play upon oach other, as. for instance,
the lungs against the chest walls in
respiration. In situations like this we
often find a closed sac so disposed that
it covers both surfaces; as in the chest
the outer surface of the lungs and the
inner surface of the chest are covered
by the pleura, which is a closed sac
containing a serous fluid, which moist
ens the surface and prevents undue
friction during respiration.

But, above all, we are grateful that this is a land of hope,
in which the man who is down to-day may be up to-mor
row because of the abundance of opportunity and the ease
with which nature yields to the honest toil of man.
So, let us enjoy the spcial, spiritual and brotherly oppor
tunities of the day, spill greatly of our abundance into the
laps of those less blessed, and, fellowshipping, all men be
thankful.
THE old Puritans were a stern and unimaginative
people. Life for them had been a series of hard
, knocks, and their natures were armed for aggression
and resistance. They had a definite idea of the rights of
j human reason and human judgment, joined to a strongly
! superstitious faith. They were willing to become wanderers
on the face of the earth to find a place that they could
exclusively people and where they could found and de
fend a theocracy in which they would be free.
The enfranchisement sought for themselves was regarded
as a birthright which they were unwilling to share with
others. Long persecuted, reaction and resentment made
them the persecutors of others. But in their splendid self
will and independence were exactly the qualities needed for
the work they chose and for the foundation of the common
wealth which grew under their hard hands. No other people
in the world at their time could have mastered^ the task
they set for. themselves. The generations which have Jol
lowed them have been the beneficiaries of their character
and work, and out of" the Puritan nature the hardness and
exclusiveness have been leached until gentleness joins
firmness of purpose and both are gilded with the spirit of
universal liberty.
They founded Thanksgiving day as a substitute for Christ
mas, the observance of which, with elaborate ceremony and
ritual, they identified with their persecutors. But Thanks
giving had not long been constituted before it took on the
cheer and hope, the social expression and sentiment of
peace on earth and good will toward men which their Eng
lish ancestors had put into the observance of Christmas.
The descendants of the Puritans now observe both days
with equal respect, and both have become holidays na
tional in their character. Formerly Thanksgiving was pro
claimed by the Governors of States exclusively. The*first
proclamation of the holiday by a President was by Mr.
Lincoln, and it made a great stir. It was denounced as
another act of Federal usurpation and a blow at the sover
eign rights of the States. Opposition Governors were in
clined to proclaim a different day, and a decidedly thankless
feeling was engendered among those who at that time were
interested in making capital against the administration.
After the war for a considerable time the day was felt to
be identified with Northern sentiment. Its remote Yankee
origin was against it, and it was therefore quite generally
ignored in the South. Now, we believe, this has all passed
away, and throughout the Union there is observance of
the holiday. It is everywhere a day of family reunion, of
pilgrimage of children far scattered to the old home; and
when that is impossible members of families gather and
greet in social intercourse and enjoyment.
It has become a day for remembering the less fortunate,
not in charity, but in fellowship. The plenty that blesses
the prosperous overflows upon the tables of the poor, and
the brotherly spirit moves all who can to see to it that
every one has occasion to be thankful. So, as a day of fel
lowship and good feeling, it levels all classes and removes
the distinction between rich and poor. This spirit makes
the world brighter and fulfills the command to remember
our neighbor.
In the hardest times we of this new nation and strong
are not left without cause for thanksgiving, since our worst
estate has in it more than others enjoy at their best. We
may see trade slacken and industry slow down, and tables
grow lean, but the earth yields in abundance, and it may
be said truly that the American spirit desires that none
suffer for food and shelter. This spirit goes out even
to those in bonds, and every one reads with pleasure al
ways that prisoners all over the United States have their
better sentiments and their early recollections of innocence
and uprightness aroused by having brought to them some
of the cheer of Thanksgiving.
California felix, land of the great happiness, has always
cause for thanksgiving. Her landscapes are poems, her
climate a blessing, her richness abounding. To live here is
to dwell in a perpetual romance, and if there were no formal
proclamation human nature would agree upon an occasion
for the enjoyment and sharing of our abundance and the
expression of a thankful spirit. Our tables are spread as
none other. Vineyard and orchard send to them the orange
and grape freshly harvested, and fig and berry and all green
things growing in our perpetual garden, garnished by. our
ever-blooming flowers, make this , a day for emphasizing
our winterless land and the fruitfulness of a soil that never
rests but gives up its wealth to man every day in the year.
Grant that the snow and frost of the East bring their
substantial pleasures and supply the charms of contrast,
yet one cannot help feeling that if the Pilgrims had landed
here New England would still be as wild as Labrador, and
their rugged souls would have been sooner softened by our
sunshine and scenery. California has every material blessing
to be thankful for; but there are things of the spirit here,
in the fraternity, charity and ineffable graces of life that
are inspired by nature's gentleness and majesty, without
which merely material prosperity would be as sounding
brass and tinkling cymbal.. In these beatitudes of the spirit
Californians share with their Eastern friends . the graces
that money does not buy nor wealth express, but which
are the common inheritance of rich and poor. < Here with
peculiar persistency we hold as our social creed that
"A man may have an honest heart,
Though poortith hourly stare him;
A man may tak his neebor's part, ; 1
Yet have no cash to spare him." r

THERE is some indulgence in gloomy anticipations
about the Colombian debt and the probable refusal
of Panama' to assume a proportion of it. We believe
the bonded debt of Colombia held in Europe amounts to
$10,000,000 in gold. Panama claims that her local revenues
have been appropriated by the Bogota Government to the
amount of about $8,000,000, no part of which has ever
been repaid. The new republic is willing to let this go,
but is disinclined to assume any part of the national debt.
As far as the revenues of the isthmus seized by Bogota
are concerned, Panama may as well consider it a permanent
investment;- for if there is anything that disgusts a Central
American Government it is the idea of ever paying any
thing. The rule, in case of assuming or changing sover
eignty by revolution or conquest, is that debts do
not go with such change. For instance, when Texas
by revolution became independent of Mexico in 1836
and set up the Lone Star republic she assumed
none of the national debt of Mexico. If the Con
federate States had achieved their independence < none of
the holders of the bonds of the United States would have
looked to the Confederacy to pay a proportion of them.
An exception may be made in Panama because of the
interest of the United States in the independence of the
isthmus and the safety of the canal. The expectation 4 of
Bogota that we will recede is vain. Colombia has sowed of
the wind and must reap of the whirlwind. As the British
bondholders feel that their security is impaired, there is no
doubt that the United States, asan act of amity, : will ad
vise that Panama assume as much of the Colombian debt as
her 300,000 people should pay. Even if this suggestion be not
adopted there* will be no European complication and no
war upon t either Colombia or Panama, for the issue pre
sented is for The Hague court. It is a question of equity,
and not law, and that court can be trusted to decide it.
The process will be a joint action of Panama, Colombia
and the* United States, by protocol agreeing to arbitrate at
The Hague, naming the arbitral /issues and pledging them
selves to abide by the award There is no <ioubt that if
Colombia would quit- thumping h'er chest, tearing her hair
and yowling about her honor and institute good govern
ment,' peace and prosperity among her people she would
beable to pay her foreign debt and return the millions she

According to the observations of a
titled European diplomat Pius X has
violated another rule of pontifical eti
quette. The latter has prescribed that
the occupant of the chair of St. Peter
should never make use of a watch, and
although Leo XIII had received hun
dreds of watches, many of them adorn
ed with jewels and of great value, he
was always obliged when he wished to
know the hour of the day to inquire
for the information from one of the
prelates in attendance. Pius X, how
ever, will not hear of any restrictions
of this Byzantine character, and per
sists In carrying and in making fre
quent use of the cheap nickel watch
which was his inseparable companion
when he was Archbishop and patriarch
of Venice. Perhaps the reason for its
remaining with him was Just because
it was. of no monetary value and would
have fetched nothing at the Mont de
Piete or pawnshop. For at Venice he
was so freehanded in his charities that
he was always in financial straits, hav
ing even pledged his archiepiscopal
ring in order to give the money raised
thereon to some deserving case of
charity, within three months before his
election to succeed Leo XIII as Pope.

Unusual Decision.
THE installation of a new ferry to Oakland should
stimulate settlement on the east side of the bay.
Whenever a new facility appears that is its natural
result. The land lines on the other side which connect
with the new bay route tap districts splendidly adapted to
residence purposes and which will soon be sought by
thousands of people who do business in San Francisco but
who prefer for all or part of the year the change afforded
by the Contra Costa Mountains and the suburbs of Oak
land, Berkeley and Alameda. The scenic, advantages are
unequaled. When the new tunnel was opened through
the mountains to connect Oakland with Contra Costa
County it was discovered that the road to it is a scenic
boulevard of the greatest charms, perhaps second only to
the mountain road that climbs Tamalpais. People cannot
be kept away from such fine locations for homes except
by extraordinary circumstances affecting access to the spots
which so allure the fancy.
Only one thing, can spoil the prospect opened to the
east shore of the bay. by additional ferry facilities. The
new line challenges the Southern Pacific ferries to a trial
of speed. The history of the latter system furnishes evi
dence that safety has been its first motive. While com
muters occasionally growled about speed, they were a unit
in commending the provisions for safety. Now, if rivalry
sacrifices safety to speed, the effect upon the eastern shore
will be disastrous. We get frequent reminders of the need
of consulting safety first in the accidents, usually without
casualty, that occur in the bay fogs. It is a maxim in all
transportation that as speed rises safety declines. San Fran
cisco is interested in building up her tributary territory.
The more attractive the eastern shore is made the better
for this city. Thousands of people will come to settle there
who do not care to live on this side. But from the moment
of their settlement there they become tributary to this
city.' They wish to cross the bay â to go and come at will â
and the opportunity to do so is one inducement to settle
there. But get among them the idea that speed has over
taken safety and settlement will cease.
It is an age of enterprise and progress and adventure.
The prosperity of the last few years has equipped thousands
with ability to live where they please, to cast their lines
in places pleasant to them. But they will not in doing so
take on risks and anxieties that offset the advantages which
attract them. Let us have a safe ferry service first, and
sacrifice not a bit of it to speed.

of the St. Louis "World's Fair in the
way of a whale farm, to be conducted
on a water covered pasture, the whale
milk to be sold instead of the milk of
cows or goats. He puts the suggestion
in this way: ,-â¢:
"My proposition is to catch fat,^Â£resh
whales, bring them up to the World's
Fa,lr ground by way of the Gulf of
Mexico and Mississippi River to a wet
pasture, this pasture to be suitable for
the maintenance and the milking of
these animals. Now, in order that you
may understand the commercial value
of this undertaking, I will give you
some figures.
"Suppose we obtain thirty whales.
Each whale has, according to the en
cyclopedia, thirty breasts; each breast
will supply. eleven gallons of milk twice
daily; each-graJlon Is worth $0 so that
the sum total per day would be
30x30x32, or $19,800. Each whale is good
commercially for 100 days. At the end
of such period the magnificent sum of
$1,930,000 would stand to our credit."
"The astuteness and resourcefulness
of a number of criminal lawyers in this
city," said a Superior Judge a few days
ago, "have kept many a guilty man
out of Jail. There is one lawyer here
' who secured an acquittal of a man
charged with a forgery a few years
ago under circumstances that, to say
the least, showed him to be a trickster
beyond compare.
"The man was guilty beyond a
shadow of a doubt and the Jurymen
who were to decide his fate thought so
to a man up to the time this attorney
presented his case to them. Then he
shattered the prosecution's case to
atoms, and he did it simply by calling
the Jury's attention to the hands of
his client. 'Look at this man's hands.*
he said, with all the force of a trained
orator: 'could they, tnlck and ungain
ly, calloused and stiff as they are, wield
a pen with such skill as must have
been the skill of the man who wrote
the signature on this check? It is pre
posterous to suppose that such hands
are capable of performing such a deed."
"Well, the Jury brought in a verdict
of not guilty after being out little more
than an hour. It developed the next
day that the accused during the en
tire three months that he was confined
awaiting trial had for hours at a time
paced ud and down in his cell rub

An agreement was reached that "the company sell to the

made by purchase of land or by sale to an actual owner
of land. The proposition met -with favor 'immediately, and
within a few minutes the business people signed contracts
covering a thousand acres of land."

significance of the enterprise was indicated by Professor
Fortier of the University of California, who estimated that
the water in the ditch would irrigate- 200,000 acres in May,
62,000 acres in June and 17,000 acres in July.

He proved his great strength in the
board by having David. Scannell elected
Chief. Scannell was a devoted friend of
Rainey's, and. like the deceased, was
a born fireman. Powerful influences
were brought to bear upon the board,
but the outside influences could not de
feat Rainey's nominee. David Scannell
was elected Chief and proved to the
whole world that his selection was a
Â¦wise one.
Later on Ackerson won. When J. J.
Kennedy. John Rosenfeld and Martin
Bulger got on the board by resignation

nell was made Chief.
Early in his career he showed an ap
titode for leading men. He was se
lected a delegate to the Board of Dele
gates, which then looked after the des
tinies of the volunteer fire department.
This board subsequently gave way to
the Board of Fire Commissioners. In
this board Rainey did excellent work.
He then saw the necessity of a strong
Democratic organization and began to
develop one. With the Fire Depart
ment as a nucleus, he surrounded him
self with men that took his orders and
did his bidding and he soon became
a power. He was elected In 1S68 a
member of the Board of Fire Commis
sioners and for four years was recog
nized as the master of the board.
When the Legislature was Demo
cratic a bill was passed recognizing
the Fire Department, and Torrey and
Merrill, the fire underwriters, were put
out. but regained their positions again
in 1S72. Rainey and Reynolds were re
tained, and when the Legislature ad
journed they were in the minority for
McLane and Curtis. The Democrats,
however, refused to stand with them.
For six months Rainey and Reynolds
voted for J. E. Nuttman for chief of
the department. Curtis and McLane
stood for Ackerson and B. H. Freeman
for Whitney.

led the best methods to improve the
service. His ideas and suggestions were
always considered and often adopted
by those in authority. His whole aim
was to give this city one of the best
departments in the world, and he lived
long enough to see It under splendid
discipline, commanded by an ideal fire
fighter. Chief Dennis Sullivan, and the
men placed on a salaried basis.
Chief Sullivan yesterday paid a high
tribute to his friend. He was greatly
affected by the news of his death. He
said Samuel Rainey was the, best
friend the department ever had and
every fireman will mourn his taking
off, because he was always devoted to
their interests. He recalled Mr.
Rainey's good deeds and kindly ways.
He was affected by the news and those
around him were likewise - depressed.

Friends crowded the home of sorrow

Chief Dennis Sullivan of the San
Francisco Fire Department, Edwin M.
Graney, Colin M. Boyd, George Max
well and Fisher Ames were numbered
among his closest friends. Graney's
sorrow at the death of his friend was
so great that he tried to get out of
refereeing the contest between Fitz
slmmons and Gardner. But for the
fact that the contest might not go on
if he was not In the ring, Graney would
have declined to officiate.
When the new charter went into ef
fect the power of Rainey was some
what crippled, as the various patron
age offices were put under civil service.
Rainey was greatly disappointed when
his life-long friend, George Maxwell,
was ousted as secretary of the Board
of Fire Commissioners and he blamed
Mayor Phelan for the downfall of his
friend. Despite this removal, Rainey's
influence was still strong, and It con
tinued so up to his death. The Board
of Fire Commissioners appreciated his
services to the department to such an
extent that at one of its meetings it
drafted resolutions of thanks to him.
Mr. Rainey was a member of the
Olympic Club. He used to visit the
athletic institution daily for a swim.
He was always cheery and delighted to
meet the young athletes. He was very
popular with the club members and the
news of his death will be deeply re
gretted by them.

1S95 the "bosses" dissolved partnership.
The Quarrel that brought about the
split-up between the two leaders was
the effort on Buckley's part to give Jo
seph Dimond the Mayoralty nomina

put forth the name of James D. Phelan.
As usual Rainey's Judgment prevailed.
Mayor Phelan was nominated and was
elected.
Dr. Bedloe went to the Orient sev
eral months ago as the representative
of a newspaper syndicate and reached
Japan on October 8, the- day on which
It was expected that the outbreak be
tween Russia and Japan would occur.
Naturally he was disappointed over the
turn of affair?. For a number of years
he was American Consul at Amoy and
Formosa and is familiar with the Chi-
I nese and Japanese people. He Is of the
j opinion that the latter are eager for
1 war with Russia and says that the lit
j tie brown men have no fear of the re
j suit. He claims that the Japanese are
stronger as. a naval force in the East
i than Russia and are steadily strength- j
ening their fleet- by converting a num
ber of mail steamers, recently pur
chased, into armored cruisers.
Dr. Bedloe regards the alliance be
tween Great Britain, Germany and
Japan as one purely defensive and ln
| dlcates that England will not permit
I any nation to make war on Japan.
John Goodnow, United States Consul
General at Shanghai, and Dr. Edward
Bedloe. for many years in the Amer
ican consular service in the Orient,
were among the passengers on the
steamer from China and Japan
ports yesterday. Consul Gen
eral Gootlnow is on a leave of
absence of sixty days, the greater por
tion of which he purposes to spend
with relatives, in Minneapolis. He goes
first to Ann Arbor to meet his son, who
is a student there. From Minneapolis
he will go to Washington and thence
to New York. The American represen
tative does not look for war in the
Orient, but, believes that the existing
trouble will be satisfactorily settled
between the contending nations. He
expressed himself as highly pleased
with the new Chinese treaty, which he
declared is of great importance to the
United States.
REDWOOD CITY, Nov. 25. â The
taking of testimony in the McDermott
will contest was completed this morn
ing. The arguments will be made by
the attorneys as soon as the short
hand reporter writes up the te&timony.
Mrs. Mary Anne Burns, who takes
practically all of the estate under the
will, was called to the stand this morn
j ing for cross-examination. She said
that she had given up all hope of
finding a will at the time it was dis
covered by Mrs. Foye among some
things taken from the McDermott
house on the night of Mrs. McDermott's
death. She was shown the will and
made the statement that she never saw
it before. She said she was not pres
ent at Mrs. Foye's when the will was
found and that her husband took it to
her attorney in San Francisco upon its
being given him by Mrs. Foye.
John Burns testified that on May 13
his wife asked him to go to San Mateo,
they living in San Francisco at the
time, and get some clothes left with
Mrs. Foye by Mrs. Burns some months
previous. He met a friend named Don
nelly and asked him to accompany him.
Burns took a large hafhper with him
in which to pack the clothes. As soon
as they arrived at the Foye residence
Mrs. Foye brought out a basket and in
transferring the things from the basket
to the hamper she found the will. Burns
was closely examined about this cir
cumstance by .the contestants and
asked if it was not all prearranged
that the will should be found in just
this way, and if he did not slip the will
Into the basket when Mrs. Foye's at
tention was distracted. This he in
dignantly denied.
Donnelly gave similar evidence as to
the finding of the will and denied that
he had any hand in placing the will in
the basket.

Husband of Legatee Tells of
Finding of the Disputed
Document.
Deceased was 63 years of age. He
was a native of Philadelphia and was
bora there August 3. lÂ£Â«0. He received
a common school education, and at the
age cf 15 years accompanied his parents
to California. He arrived here in No
vember, 1E55. After his arrival Rainey
went to work In the Union Iron Works.
He served his apprenticeship under the
late Peter Donahne. He became an ex
pert machinist and worked at his trade
for many years. Rainey was a sober,
studious young man, and he improved
his mind by reading and study. Like
other young men. In 1S60 he Joined the
old volunteer fire department, and the
records show he was attached to En
gine 6, which was stationed on Sacra
mento street, near Sansome. Sub
sequently he was attached to Engine
10, on Pacific street, near Kearny.
In 1867 Rainey became engineer of
Engine 1, which position be filled until
he was elected Fire Commissioner in
1SCS.
He was a born fireman. He loved the
He enjoyed sport and often he at
tended the races. He loved a good
horse. andQiothlng delighted him more
than to thoroughbreds in action.
He was also interested in a "book" at
the track- He occasionally bet at the
races, buir never heavily.
Samuel Rainey s career in politics
Â¦was an interesting one. It started in
1Â£M and continued up to his death. He
had his victories and. his defeats. He
never lost courage when adversity
overtook his side, but only bent his
resourceful energies to perfecting the
organization that it might be success
ful the next time. In the carspaipn
just closed Samuel Rainey eucceeoted in
carrying two districts, the Thirty
eighth, where he lived, and the Forty
third. He was opposed to Gavin Mc-
Xab and the county organization, and
despite the efforts of the friends of Me-
TCab carried the districts at the pri
mary election and went into the con
vention with colld delegations. He
Joined forces with the "Horses and
Carts." as the minority was called, and
tried to secure his share of the patron
age offices. McNab checkmated him,
however, as he had the highest number
cf votes in the convention. Rainey was
opposed to Lane's nomination and
swung his support to Mayor Schmitz.
It was due to his efforts that the Fire
Department voted solidly for the re
election of the Mayor.

betrayed a confidence and was never
accused of doing so. He had enemies,

dealt fairly with the men who sought
to injure him. and those who did him a

POPULAR WITH ALL MEN.
He was extremely popular with all
classes-^f men. Despite the tremendous
powers"^he wielded he never lost his
head. He %Gs always the same, always
approachable, was hot given to

late delegates so that they would vote
for candidates friendly to his cause. He
was able to swing votes at will, and
even up to the time of his demise was
a leading factor in politics.
In his death the San Francisco Fire
Department loses a true friend. He
was a fireman in his younger years and
was devoted to the brave men who risk
their lives to save property. All his
energies were devcted to the work of
improving the department, and this

Uncle Sam
Has Dyspepsia,
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Are a Positive
and Permanent Cure for the
National Disease.
As a people we eat too much and the
wrong kind of food. Because it tastes
good we crowd the stomach with rich,
unnutritious food and drink. We over-
tax the digestive apparatus to such an
extent that it refuses to perform its
duty and a conglomerate mass of half
chewed, undigested material lies in the
stomach until it rots, causing the forma-
tion of acids, gases and ptomaines,
which produce the painful condition
which we 'know as dyspepsia.
For business men. office men and
clerks, and in fact every one engaged in
sedentary or indoor . occupations, grains,
milk and vegetables, with a moderate
meat allowance," are much more health-
ful than a heavy meat diet.
Only men engaged in : severe outdoor
manual labor can. live on a, heavy meat
diet and continue in. health.
It is- a well-established truth that
nine-tenths of all diseases originate. with
a breaking down of the digestion. -A
weak stomach weakens and impoverishes
the system, making it easy for disease
to gain a foothold.
Nobody need fear consumption, kidney
disease, liver trouble or a weak heart
and nervous system as long as the diges-
tion is good and the stomach able to as-
similate plenty of wholesome food.
Thousands have some form of stomach
trpuble and do not know It. They as-
cfibe the headache, the languor, nervous-
ness, insomnia, palpitation, constipation
and similar symptoms to some other
cause than tho true one. Get your di-
gestion on the right track and the heart
trouble, lung trouble, liver disease or
nervous debility will rapidly disappear.
Nothing is more certain than that the
use of so-called tonics, stimulants and
medicines, which depend upon alcohol for
their effect, Is injurious to health in the
long run.
Many liquid patent medicines derive
their effect entirely from the alcohol
they contain.
Alcohol and medicines containing it
are temporary stimulants and not in any
sense a true tonic In fact, it is doubt-
ful if any medicine or drug is a real
tonic.
A true tonic is something which will
renew, replenish, build up the exhausted
nervous system and wasted tissues of
the body; something that will enrich the
blood and endow it with the proper pro-
portions of red and white corpuscles
which prevent or destroy disease germs.
This is what a real tonic should do and
no drug or alcoholic stimulant will do it.
The only true tonic in nature is whole-
some food thoroughly digested. Every
particle of nervous energy, every minute
muscle, fiber and drop of blood is created
daily from the food we digest.
The mere eating of food has little to
do with the repair of waste tissue, but
the perfect digestion of the food eaten
has everything to do with it
The reason so few people have perfect
digestion is because from wrong habits
of living the stomach has gradually lost
the power to secrete the gastric Juice,
peptones and acids ln sufficient quantity
To cure Indigestion and stomach trou-
bles it is necessary to take after meals
some harmless preparation which will
supply the natural peptone and diastase
which every weak stomach lacks, and
probably the best preparation of this
character is Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
which may be found in every drug store
and which contain ln pleasant, palatable
form the wholesome peptone and diastase
which nature requires for prompt diges-
tion. Â¦
One or two of these excellent tablets
taken after meals will prevent souring,
fermentation and acidity and Insure com-
plete digestion and assimilation.
ptuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are as
equally valuable for little children as for
adults, as they contain nothing harmful
or stimulating, but only the natural di-
gestives. â¢
Â¦ One of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will
digest 1800 grains of meat, eggs or other
wholesome food, and they are ln every
sense a genuine tonic, because they
bring about in the only natural way a
restorative of nerve power, a building
up of lost tissue and appetite, ln the only
way it can be done, by the digestion and
assimilation of wholesome food.
The root of the matter is this, the di-
gestive elements contained in Stuart's
Dyspepsia : Tablets will digest the food,
give , the ' overworked stomach a chance
to recuperate, and the nerves and whole
system receive the nourishment which
can only come from food; stimulants and
nerve tonics never give' real strength;
they Â¦ give a fictitious strength. Invaria-
bly followed by reaction. Every drop of
blood, every nerve and tissue is manu-
factured from our daily food, and if you
can insure Its prompt action and com-
plete digestion by the regular use of sÂ«
good and wholesome a remedy as Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets you will have no need
of nerve tonics and sanitariums. â¢-
- Although Stuart's Dyspepsta Tablets
have been In the market only a few
years, yet probably every druggist in the
United States. Canada and Great Britain
now sells them and considers them ; the
most popular and successful of any
preparation for stomach . trouble.

ered with a cold.

Round 4â Fltz immediately swung . a
right to the Jaw arid they mixed It, Bob
ducking and blocking "cleverly. Fitz

right to the Jaw and Gardner went to
the floor. He came : up and Fitz plaritr
ed several frightful lefts and rights to
the face and body that'sent the; Lowell
man to his corner groggy. ' The , tumult
for Fltz at this stage was tremendous.
Fitz very cool. He nearly had Gardner
out twice. . .Â¦ .
: Round 5â Fitz landed a left; swing to
the Jaw. and Gardner went'! down for
the count of nine. Fitz chased him
around the ring and' had' Gardner
great cheer arose, and it increased in
volume until the Cornishman stepped
into the ring. He looked like a rain
bow. He presented many colors to the
waiting spectators. His red hair topped
off a sweater that was a cross between
sky-blue and dapple gray. He wore
purple trunks and lavender socks. To
cap the climax he started to put on
green gloves, and before the flght had
started Gardner was color-blind.
Gardner came in immediately after
Fitzsimmons. He had a bathrobe over
his phoulders. He walked over to the
northwest corner of the ring and was
made ready for the fray by his seconds.
Gardner had Alec Greggains, Billy
Pierce, Dave Barry and Harry Foley
in his corner. Fitzsimmons had Billy
Delaney, Sam Berger, Joe Kennedy and
Johnny Croll Jr. in his corner.
Gardner's costume consisted of green
trunks and green socks. A green belt
was fastened around his waist.. Fltz
had a belt of American flags. When
the pair were called to the center of
the ring by Referee Graney Gardner
looked small alongside his big chested
opponent. He was pale and nervous.
Fitz looked more rugged than Gardner.
Fitz was Introduced as the only mid
dle-weight champion of the world. Cap
tain of Police Mooney stepped Into the
ring to see that neither fighter had a
horseshoe In his gloves for luck, and
when Jack Johnson made his bow Billy
Jordan raised his voice and announced
that the battle would be a twenty
round contest, Marquis of Queensberry
rules, and. the. men would protect them
selves in the breakaway and break at
the order of the referee. He then yelled.
"Let 'er sol" and the gong sounded
and the men started on their-unsatis
factory twenty-round Journey.
i BOXERS ARE PUNISHED.
After the^flght Fitzsimraons sat in
his dressing room with a puffed lip and
swollen hands. He complained of bad
"mitts" and Dr. Clarence F. Tillman,
the club's physician, examined them.
He <advlsed Fltz to keep the adhesive
plaster on untllhe reached his rooms,
where' special attention could be given
him. Fltz received the congratulations
of his friends in a modest manner. He
thought he had done well for an -old
man. He gave strict orders that the sil
ver cup presented by F. H. Lynn, W.
Flske and James Hammersly, members
of Local. No. 6, Independent Order of
Electrical Workers, be taken to his
room.
Gardner was surrounded by sympa
thetic friends. George did no talking.
He was downcast because he had not
won. His face was badly swollen and
he had a cut over his right eye. . He
was able to dress himself and went to
the Hammam baths. . \
The management of the fight was ex
cellent. Every seatholder got his seat.
There were lots of ushers 'In attend
ance and Plnkerton detectives saw to
It that interlopers were kept out of the
boxes. The contests , were brought off
as scheduled and Manager James Cof
froth deserves praise for the excellent
Judgment he used.. ..
The receipts of the house were a little
over $16,000. This fell short of the
club's calculation.
Robert Fitzsimmons deposed George
Gardner as the light heavyweight
champion boxer of the world last night
in their fight at Mechanics' Pavilion,
which lasted twenty rounds. The fight
â¢was disappointing, as Gardner made no
stand against his veteran opponent un
til the last two rounds.
He was outclassed from the start and
was palpably suffering from stage
fright. His blows, when they landed at
Infrequent intervals, had no sting In
them and until the last two rounds they
had no effect on Fitz, being shed off by
his big freckeled arms or shoulders as
a duck shakes water from its back. In
the nineteenth and ' twentieth rounds
Gardner's courage seemed to revive and
he went at Fitzsimmons with the body
blows with which he whipped Jack
Root twice. These stung the Cornlsh
man and left him a tired boxer when
the gong sounded the end of hostilities.
For round after round It seemed Fitz
fimmons could end matters any time
he wished. He held off and let Gard
ner recover when the Lowell man
seemed about to go out. The specta
tors did not approve of these tactics
and Jeered the boxers. Some men at
the ringside went so far as to intimate
that the fighters had an agreement
that one of them was to go out and
that the one nominated failed to live
up to his agreement. If it were possible
for Fitz to have entered- Into such an
agreement it would have been Impos
sible for him to have carried it out, as
he did not receive a blow which had
force enough in it to appear to stop
him.
FITZ'S HANDS DAMAGED.
Alter the fight Fitz showed a pair of
badly damaged hands In explanation
of his lack of effectiveness In punching.
He knocked Gardner down with a ter
rific left to the head in the .fourth
round, putting his left hand out of
commission. Gardner was down six
ppconds. "When he stood up Fitz rushed
him to the ropes and sent right and left
to the head In rapid succession. Fltz
font one particularly hard right to the
hf ad and followed this with a right
uppercut. The force of the latter blow
'.vas so sreat that Gardner was flung
half way across the ring, landing on
his back. Gardner hung on to avoid
further pimishment until the end of the
round. TH<? house, which wae evidently
with Fitz from the flrst, was in an
uproar, as it seemed Gardner would
prove easyprey for his opponent.
Gardner was still dazed when he
came up for the fifth round. Another
left to the head and Gardner Â¦ went to
his v knees for nine seconds. For the
major part of this round Fltz played
â¢with Gardner as a cat plays with a
mouse. He let Gardner hit him and
did not try to hit back. It waa at
this point that Fitz made the fatal mis
take which coat him a clean-cut vic
tory- He let Gardner recover and was
roundly hissed for his tactics. Gard
ner's right eyeÂ»was badly cut in this
round. Â¦' , -V
Fitz started to rough it In the seventh
round, giving Gardner the elbow, at
which the spectators showed their dis
pleasure. Toward the end of the round
Gardner was Improving and Fitz was
not altogether happy. He was better
again in the. eighth and tried all he
knew to win.
GARDNER KNOCKED DOWN.
Gardner was down again in the four
teenth round for fl-ve seconds. He was
dazed and hung on to save himself
from punishment. .
Gardner was wrestled 'to the mat
early In the nineteenth round. Fltz
complained that he -was hitting l(rw,
but the claim was not allowed. For
the first time Gardner began to rip In
rights and. lefts to the body and Fitz
was sorely troubled. Gardner contin
ued these tactics In the last round and
Fitz seemed very tired. He had
strength enough to 6end his left to the
head, staggering Gardner. When the
gong sounded Referee Graney pointed
tc Fitz as the winner. The crowd did
not disperse, but stood and cheered the
jcreat fighter. They demanded and re
demanded a speech, but all Fltz would
Ray was: "Haven't I done enough for
one night?"
Fitz showed the most consummate
ring generalship. His every move
seemed to have been studied out and
he hardly wasted a blow. He kept the
Frectators guessing throughout as to
his condition. He needed but little at
tention from his seconds and was smil
ing at all times. He was waiting all
the time to send his right across to the
jaw. but could not make connections.
LOWELL MAN FRIGHTENED.
Gsrdner v.as obviously frightened
from the start and did all his fighting
at long range. He was not sure of
himself, although he showed gameness
throughout in going after Fitz.
While waiting for the big men to
corno Into the ring. Announcer Billy
Jordan presented "Philadelphia" Jack
OBrien. O'Brien was given a hearty
reception, and in answer to cries for a
epeech told the announcer to say that
hÂ»> was no speech-makÂ«?r, but was will
ing to meet any man in the world at
358 pounds. "Sandy" Ferguson, the
heavyweight boxer, modestly rushed
into the rins and was joshed by the
pallerj-. Ferguson wanted It known
that he was to fight Jack Johnson, but
the crcxv<! paid no attention to him, as
lie fs not taken seriously as a fighter.
It was 9:C5 when the tall form of
FKzslir.mons was observed' by the
crowd coming toward the ring. A
FIGHT BY ROUNDS.
Fitzsimmona Has Gardner in Hand
at All Stages'.
The following is the fight by rounds
as seen by an expert at the ringside:
Round 1â The men went to the center
Round. 16â Gardner, got in a left and
right on Bob's face and forced him to a
corner: Fitz came back with a stinging
straight left f orC the face, j Fitz , nursed
his strength "carefully arid made no un
necessary, moves. Â¦â¢; Fitz. swung â¢ hard
with right for the jaw, but Gardner
Round 13 â Fltz missed a left swing
for the Jaw and received a straight left
on the mouth. - Gardner then poked
Fitz in the stomach with a straight
left and chased Fltz into a corner. They
danced around the ring for fully a min
ute without a blow being landed. Gard
ner kepj pegging away at Fitz, but the
latter .easily got out of harm's way.
Finally Fitz brought his left to the
body and a left to the nose. Gardner
sent in two straight lefts to the face
and a light left to the body, but there
was little force In the blows. Just as
the round closed Fitz- swung a hard
right to | the Jaw, sending Gardner to
the floor. He was up within two sec
onds and" showed no effects of the blow
as he took his chair.
Round 14â Gardner was short with a
straight left for the body. Fitz feinted
with right and sent two left to the
Jaw. He followed "it. with "a hard left
hook to the Jaw and a hard right to the
body. Swinging fiercely, he sent the
Lowell man to the floor for five seconds.
Fltz then missed a fearful right swing
for the jaw and chased Gardner against
the ropes, trying to 'put In a finishing
blow, but his efforts were wild. Gard
ner looked groggy and stalled repeated
ly. J The' blood was streaming from his
nose, and as they went to a clinch the
crowd hissed Gardner for hitting. Fits
swung his right to the Jaw and sent
Gardner against the ropes. He followed
him around the ring and missed -a right
swing that would have ended the fight, 1
had it landed, as the bell rang. Gard
ner went to his corner groggy. Fitz
appeared cool and smiled at his friends.
Round 15 â Fitz missed a . left swing.
Then they went to a 'clinch. Emerging.
Fltz missed a hard swing for the jaw
<and Gardner . succeeded in .getting a
glancing left to the Jaw. Fltz drove his
right ; to. the, body and then shifted it to
the head and cleverly evaded counters.
Fltz fought carefully- and made his
.blows count .when . he reached the
Lowell man's anatomy. Fltz landed a
left and rlgb.t swing to the jaw and just
missed another, for the same place. Fltz
Jarred Gardner s with a hard right swing
to the jaw and a left hook to the. body.
Gardner again stalled,-; Fitz missed an
other .right swing for.the jaw, and as
they : came together Gardner got In a
straight: left to the face lightly. This
was Fitz's . round.
in as the latter tried a straight left for
the Jaw. The pace again slowed up
and the crowd yelled at the contest
ants. Fitz shifted and brought a' hard
left swing to the jaw. He tried to fol
low It with a right, but missed his
mark. Fitz then swung clear around
from a missed right upper-cut. Gard
ner landed a few light blows on Fltz.
but Fitz took them, at the same time
trying to bring his right to play. Gard
ner's blows were very light. As yet he
had failed to land a telling blow on the
lanky Australian.
The fight was the worst I ever
refereed. Fitzsimmons was
justly entitled to the decision, as
he had Gardner in distress *
throughout the battle. Gardner
did no fighting until the last
three rounds, when he sailed in
and tried to win. Gardner
fought like the veriest amateur.
He was either mortally afraid
of Fitzsimmons or had a very
bad case of stage fright. I could
not make it a draw. I am sure
my decision was a good one.
Even "Billy" Pierce, manager
of "Gardner, was satisfied. Gard
ner was lucky to stay the dis
tance, /fitz was too big and
strong for him. In the middle
of the fight' I told the two to
go in and fight. I could see
that Fitz was troubled with bad
hands and that Gardner was
in fear of a heavy punch. Fitz
in my opinion was out of con
dition. He showed . it repeat
edly. He was as slow as an ice
wagon^and had no steam in. him.
Had he been the old-time Fitz.
he would have won in three
rounds. Personally, ., I was in
ill health and was depressed by
the 1 death of my good ' friend,
Mr. Rainey. I did not want to
referee the contest, but had to
do. so to prevent a postpone
ment. â Edmund M. Graney.
Graney Declares
Fight Was Very
Unsatisfactory
, Round Fltz, as ,; usual, baeked
away.' 'â¢ They came together In a mix-up
but " no ' damage was ' done. â¢ Gardner
Jabbed a left into Fitz's face and closed
rrrz smiles at friends.
Round 11â Fitz caught Gardner with
right to the stomach and then hooked
him viciously with a left on the wind.
Fltz fought hard, but Gardner blocked
him. Gardner's punches seemed to lack
force. -Gardner swung his. left' to i the
body and backed away from two left
swings. for the face. Fitz Jolted Gard
ner with, a straight left to the stom
ach, and Fitz cleverly blocked ". Gard~
ner's attempts. ', Fitz . took ' most of the
light blows, but blocked the harder
ones. ; Gardner sent a straight right to
the face, but Fitz sailed In 'with a left
swingsto^the Jaw,- staggering Gardner.
The gong rang at this stage. Fitz had
the advantage of the round.
Round 8â Both were short with lefts
for the face. Fitz feinted with right
and put a good left to the face. The
Australian was backing away, allowing
Gardner to do the leading. Gardner fin
ally planted left and right to the stom
ach and a left hook lightly t<5 the face.
Gardner blocked a vicious left for the
Jaw and sent a straight left' lightly to
the face. Fltz missed left and right
swings the body, and they came to
a clinch in Gardner's corner. Fitz sent
Gardner against the ropes with left and
right to the jaw,, and then put a left to
the Jaw and a right to the body. Gard
ner then clinched and blocked a riglit
and left upper-cut for the jaw. Fitz Im
proved again in this round and the
advantage was his.
Round 9â The Corrilshman backed
away, allowing Gardner to do the lead
ing. Gardner was short with left for
the* head and missed a right swing for
the body. Fitz then met him with a
left hook to the Jaw and danced away
as the Lowell pugilist chased him
around the ring.' Fitz missed a hard
left swing for the body. Gardner con
tinued to chase Fitz "around the
ring, but did not succeed In
landing. Fitz finally* waded in and
forced Gardner to the ropes, but more
from wrestling than by blows. Gard
ner swung a good right to the kidneys
and swung a right to the Jaw as the
bell sounded, but it was a glancing
blow and Fitz only smiled. Fitz has
slowed-up considerably, but is evidently
laying for his famous knockout punch.
. Round 10â Fltz J missed a fierce right
hook for the head and Gardner was
wild with a right .swing. Fitz backed
away and '.- contented himself with
blocking Gardner's leads. Fltz jolted
Gardner' with' a left to the' Jaw, but
Gardner retaliated with a hard right to
the Jaw. Fltz hooked his left to the
face and they came together. Fitz
broke the clinch with a left hook hard
to -the* stomach and Gardner jabbed
Fitz's mouth three times with left,
drawing blood. Fitz crossed left to the
face. Gardner kept Jabbing with left
to the mouth and tantalized the Austra
lian. Fitz, however, took the blows
with a view to getting in a good punch.
They came together with considerable
force at the close of the round and
Gardner slipped down. He was up
quickly and went" at once to his cor
ner. Â¦
missed a left swing for the Jaw. Both
men looked very tired. They got to
close quarters and both. tried lefts. and
rights for the body, but â the efforts
were futile. The gong found both men
fighting tamely, with the crowd Jeering
and urging them on. Fitz appeared to
be losing his speed and seemed content
with acting more on the defensive.
GARDNER USES LEFT.
It was simply an old man
against a good young man.
Gardner is a tough nut to crack.
My hands were gone and I could
do nothing. The first time I
knocked Gardner down I dislo
cated the knuckle of my left
hand. I "kidded" him all the
time and was really ashamed to
hit him. I got t;ired and hurt
my hands, and it dawned on me
I would have to fight for a de
cision. I wanted to go in and
finish him, but my seconds
begged me to stay away. When
I went into the ring I was a
sick man. I wrote a letter to
George Dawson to-day, telling
him I would be lucky if I won.
I wanted to fight, although my
friend, Maj'or McLaughlin, was
willing to have it postponed. I
was opposed to putting it off, as
I was confident I would win.
His punches never bothered me.
The blows he sent in were
usually caught on my arms. His
jabs were easy and never wor
ried me. My hands hurt me
more than Gardner's punches.
They were knocked -out on Jef
fries ,and they got bad before
many rounds. Pretty - good
showing for an old man, eh? â
Robert Fitzsimmons.
I think I should have had the
decision. Fitz . is the hardest
propositon I ever went up
against. I did all the leading
and .'forcing throughout the
twenty rounds and outpointed
him. The only time I- was in
distress was in the third round
and his punches made me
groggy. He is very tricky and
kept me away by his dangerous
swings. I tried to finish him the
last three rounds, but he stalled
all the way through.' I tried
hard' to knock him out, but my
blows seemed to land on his
arms and shoulders. He is too
big for me, I guess. I have no
complaints. to make. My condi
tion was good. I went in to get
him, but he was able to take the
punches I landed.. The short
lefts I landed bothered him very
greatly. I kept poking it at him
in the hope of getting close
enough to land my right, but
he avoided me. I made him
sidestep and break ground
throughout the contest. I know
I did not put up my usual bat
tle. It must have been due to
the peculiar style my opponent
had of boxing. Fitz used rough
tactics. - He -provod stronger
than I and was able to keep me
back. He had me "buffaloed"
early in the fight. After I got
over roy nervousness I went
right at him and kept after him
for ten rounds. Fitz had the
best of it for ten rounds, but I
think I was the better man in
the last half of the fight. That
is why I think the decision be
longed to me. â George Gardner.
Fitzsimmons Says
He Was Sick and
Hands Pained Him
Gardner Believes
He Was Entitled
to the Decision
John Ritchie, a has-been, was trotted
out to go four round* with Georgre
Curran, an ex-amateur. After Ritchie
ha"d been knocked down a few times
the crowd wondered how he had nerve
enough to come out here and seek a
battle .with Frankie Neil. Ritchie may
have been a good man In his time, but
his clock has stopped. To use. a ring
term, he is "all in." He seemed to be
bewildered and woefully out. of form.
He thought he had a snap and went at
Curran with that thought In his mind.
This idea was suddenly lessened when
Curran let fly a "hay-maker" and
Ritchie hit the carpet. He then tried
his left and caught Curran on the Jaw.
In the second round Ritchie held on
and put lefts and right to Curran's body.
Curran liked the game and came back
with heavy punches on Ritchie's head.
Manager Coffroth carried out his
promise to have the men in the ring
on time The first preliminary, be
tween Mauro Herrera and M Billy"
"Welch of Portland, proved a farce.
Herrera was afraid and "Welch knew
nothing whatever about the art of box-
Ing. The first round was slower than a
funeral and the crowd wondered what
the two men were trying to accomplish.
Herrera put on style and Welch Imag
ined he was trying to hit a friend in
the gallery. The first round was so
bad that Referee Kretlng wanted to
call in the police to have the men ar
rested for obtaining money on false
pretenses. He gave them another trial
and allowed them to bore the specta
tors for half a round more. Herrera
tried shifts, upper-cuts and wild
swings in his endeavor to make an Im
pression on the atmosphere. Welch wa3
worse. He could not punch and did not
know how to step around. After half
a round had been wasted Kreling tap
ped "Welch on the shoulder and in
vited him to go "away back and sit
down." "Welch was glad to do so and
Herrera was given the long end of the
purse, which was enough to buy him a
few lessons in boxing.
PRELIMINARY BOUTS.

weak.

the ring, missing left and right swings
for the Jaw. Fitz tried a left swing for

tried a right hook for the body, but
Bob blocked it. Gardner swung right

face and both missed rights for the
body. Fitz was short with a straight

which the Australian did some clever
blocJting. Gardner got his left high on
the body and Fitz missed a left swing
for the Jaw and another for the body.
Gardner sent In a hard right to the
Jaw at the end of the round. It was
the hardest blow Gardner had turned

face. Gardner then hooked his left to
Fitz's stomach. Fltz caught Gardner
on the head with a hard right swing.
Gardner swung right to the Jaw at the
-end of the round, but the blow was
very weak. Gardner has been putting
up a very disappointing fight, possesses
no strength and boxes very clumsily.

The fieldintr was weak for the most
part. Shay was out of the game, so
Lynch played short and Lindsey was
sent out into the left garden", lie exe
cuted a few nice catches, which were
about the only bright features to an
otherwise dulland listless exhibition.
The score:
The Cripples and the Natives went
for eix and one-half rounds yesterday
afternoon. Then the fog banks began
to loom ud in the horizon, and it was
ell off with baseball for the day.- ; The
Cripples had everything while the strife
lasted, and 'twas easy for them to win.
Score, 6 to 2.
The ball could not be seen after tho
third inning, and as there were no lan
terns handy to hang on the sphere .the
only thing to do was- to stop playing.
Doth pitchers worked well for a while.
Then Cutter's support began to weak
en and he was walloped some. The Na
tives never could reae'r. Cooper much,
so therefore they were shy on runs.

While surprises Â¦ were lookad for at
Oakland yesterday, owing to the heavy
and holding condition of the track, the
result of the slxV furlong handicap came
almost in the nature of a shock to the
talent. < Because' of some good early
morning trials, John ' A- .Scott,\ allotted
110 pounds, equal weight -with. Burnle
Buntpn, was made favorite : at 6 toi 5.
His odds '. later, receded a point and the
2 to 1 at first offered about Burnie Bun
ton lengthened, to 2%. < The favorite
raced on almost equal, terms. with Cap
tivate to 'the stretch and there* retired.
Just before the curtain 'fell; Jack Mar
tin slipped along, on" the outside with
the 8 to' 1 ehojt Evea G, winning easily
from Muresca," against which 12 to. 1
was laid; There' are thirty stable' boys
on the track. that could have furnished
a better exhibition '-- ot^> ability, than^ 'did
Ferrell on Burnle Buntoii, whiqh niare
ran fourth. '.' *' '' '
Four first, choices, in Mr. Dingle,
John A. Scott, Matt Hogan and Plucky
were bowled '.over. Â¦bjut-V-a.a the betting
was only moderately, heavy -the ring
reaped.no harvest. , Twenty-one ; books
cut in and the blockmen are prepared;
for. the expected bombardment " this
afternoon. The card -was only a .fair
one, but attracted the usual crowd of
regulars.
Lemasney Bros.' entry, Silurian, was
played down to slight favoritism B.
the speculating on the first race, a Fu
turity course selling sprint. Well han
dled through the stretch by Foley, the
brown gelding split Toto Gratiot and
Ora Viva, beating the first named a
neck. With more experienced handling
Ora Viva could have won. Amasa quit
after showing early speed.
Sol Smith kept up his reputation as
a mudlark by capturing the seven
furlong run for two-year-Olds about
as he pleased. The colt closed favorite
at 2 to 1, and In front almost from the
start, finished nearly three lengths be
fore Avenger. Crosswaite landed
Charley Schweitzer in the show at odds
of 100 to s 1. Hall had Dorice in the poor
going and collected nothing.
Mr. Dingle was fifteen minutes the
best of those starting in the third chap
ter, another seven-furlong affair, but
indifferent handling worked his down
fall. Jimmy Booker had his first try
at the game, but was not on to the
shoals and sandbars, and Loyal S, rid
den by Powell, beat Dingle half a
length. Constellator died away the
last eighth, after looking all over a
winner at one time.
If Waterbury, who rode Matt Hogan,
favorfte for the fifth event, a'Futurity
course Jaunt, does such a funny turn
again he should be furnished with a
ticket and sent to his home way down
on the Wabash or some other inky
stream over the old . reliable Tin Can
route. It was a dazzling exhibition,
even "on a muddy track. Matt Hogan
finished fifth. Nervator, a 15 to 1 shot,
nicely ridden by Larsen, outlasted
Florinel In the run home, disposing of
the little fellow by half a length.
Berendos ran third, several lengths in
front of Alta G.
James Curl's, Erne proved a good re-,
peater by taking the closing number
at a mile from a shifty cluster of
"mudders." When C. B. Campbell and
Lady Kent had played out their string
Knapp brought Erne along on the rail,
getting the decision from Billy Moore
by half a length. Pluck, the favorite,
ran a cheap race.

; Fitzsimmons Â¦Â¦ and . Gardner experi
enced no difficulty in . making the re
quired weight. They were at Harry
Corbett's T yesterday, in advance of the
required time and without any delay
proceeded to the business in hand. .;
Each man was so 'sure of his weight
that he removed only his outer gar
ments. The weights were adjusted at
the 168-pound, notch and neither man
moved the .bar.. When they had dress
ed for the street | again Referee Graney
took! them to one /side and. they dis
cussed the matter of bandages.,; It. was
finally agreed . that ordinary' surgical
tape be used, with the application of
collodion or any : liquid which would
have a hardening effect. The bandages
were to be inspected in the dressing

of ' the greatest friendship . for many
years.
When i the referee heard of the death
of his friend he positively refused to
appear in the ring and asked that
some one else be chosen. Gardner was
willing, but Fitzsimmons , would .not
listen to it, saying he would not fight

FIGHT HANGS IN BALANCE.
Johnny was glad to break ground.
Curran was wobbly on his pins, when
he went to his corner. In. the third
Ritchie had Curran down for the count.
Curran was game and came back for
more. He played possum and kept his
right / poised and whenever Ritchie
came in he would let fly and always
catch the Eastern bantam on the jaw.
Curran was very .weak on. his pins
when he went to his corner. Ritchie
tried - to finish Curran in the fourth,
but was nearly put out himself. He
bled from ear. and nose and was at sea
from the : heavy wallops . on the head.
The decision of a draw was well re
ceived by the crowd. .Champion Neil
could finish either Curran or Ritchie in
one round. Â¦Â¦;Â¦â¢
from the time the first wager was laid
a week ago.
'The first bets were made at odds of
5 to 10 with Fitzsimmons favorite. The
Gardner adherents took kindly to this
until the. odds quickly reached 9 to 10.
This was partly brought about by the
unfavorable reports from the Fitzsim
mons camp. On Tuesday the odds
hovered about 8 to 10. '.When weighlng
in time came yesterday Fitzsimmons
appeared in such fine condition that the
odds went to 7 to 10. The heavy play
of the people who liked Gardner's
chances changed these odds until when
the men entered the ring it was even
money and take your pick.

The Golden Gate Tennis Club will
hold an open mixed doubles tourna
ment on the park courts to-day. The
entry list will be small, but some of
the best players from Berkeley will
compete. The entry list â¢yill not close
until thi3 morning, when It Is thought
the players will get together and make
up teams. It Is a difficult matter to
hold a successful mixed doubles, owing
to the scarcity of women players of
even ordinary ability. George 1*. Baker
and Miss Hazel Hotchkiss of Alameda
County will probably be the strongest
team, although It 13 doubtful If they
are stronger than Charles Dunlap and
Miss Ethel Ratcliffe. Guy Lytton and
Miss Mary Ratcliffe will play together.
G. W. Finch and Miss Lulu Wegener
have joined forces. Mr. and Mrs. R.
N. Whitney have also entered.
Herbert Schmidt (owe 1-6) and Ray
Cornell and Harry Rolfe (scratch) are
all playing well and their chances are
good. Cornell at times lately has play
ed a remarkable game. When he gets
a streak he is danserous. but ordinar
ily he is very wild and erratic. Rolfe
plays an excellent game in practice,
but seems to go to pieces in tourna
ments.
Herbert Long and Alexander Bey
fuss, with odds of 4-6, should cut quite
a figure. Long is uncertain on account
of his unsteadiness. At times he plays
a brilliant game, but his head work
Is not good. Beyfuss is somewhat out
of practice, but Is at his best in a
tournament. He will, make his oppo
nents play to win with these odds.
Kuehn and Punnett also get 4-6.
I Of the lower class men A. W. Worth
lngton seemed strongest to the handl
cappers. He is given 15 3-6. while Br^
Lovegrove. W. F. Bull and W. S. Dole
are given 1-6 morn. Of the men placed
on the "SO" mark Daniel Volkmann and
Herbert Gray appear to bÂ« the strong
est.
Play will commence at 9:30 this morn
ing. All matches except finals will be
two sets out of three: finals three out
of five. The club has offered four
handsome silver trophies to thoao
reaching the semi-finals.
The drawing and handicaps follow:
The feature on the tennis courts to

players of the club, with the exception
of Grant'Smith, will compete. The most
heavily handicapped men are Drum
mond MacGavIn, Will Collier and
Frank Mitchell, who will play from 15

on the owe 4-6 mark. Collier and Allen
are steady players and their chances of
winning are considered good.
Joseph -S. Tobin. an ex-champion of
the coast in doubles and ten years ago
one of the foremost players in the
West, has entered. Tobin has been
practicing of late and as he has mod
ernized his game somewhat he is play
ing better than ever. The handicapping

Tobin's ability when it placed him on

people of that church and the First
Unitarian Church will unite their ser
vices. The sermon will be preached at
11 a. m. by the Rev. George C. Adams,
pastor of the First Congregational
Church. His theme will be. "Why Seek
a Better Country?" The choirs of both
churches have been combined and the
following music will be rendered: "Sing
Unto the Lord," Dr. H. J. Stewart;
"Fear Not Te, O Israel" and "O Lord,
How Manifold Are Thy Works." by the
choir; Mrs. Winchester, soprano of the
Unitarian Church, will sing for the of
fertory "With Verdure Clad." The or
ganists are H. Bretherick and Samuel
D. Mayer.
The people of this glorious State as a
whole can say to-day as Robert Burns
did in one of his pretty little poems:
Some hae meat and c&nna eat.
And soir.e would eat that want it;
But we hae meat, and we can eat,
fcae let the Lord be thankit.
though some may even think that of
<lod's goodness they have not received
their share. It Is well to remember
that there is always some poor soul
worse off than we.
Every one should give thanks to-day.
Every year since the Pilgrims of the
Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock in
1620 a day of thanksgiving has been
observed with fitting services in the
churches, the sentiments of the people
being voiced in . the, little verse by
Thomas Miller:
Kept by thy goodness through the day.
Thanksgivings to thy name we pour;
Nl?ht o'er u*. with its tears, we pray
Thy love to guard us evermore.
In grief console â in gladness bless â
In darkriCFs guide â in sickness cheer â
T:!!. in the Savior's righteousness.
Before thy thrcne cur souls appear.
The city of San Francisco has been
extremely fortunate in receiving such
a vast share of blessings. Times have
been prosperous and the city has been
devoid of calamities.
This day of Thanksgiving no one. no
matter how poor, need go without a
turkey dinner. For those who are too
poor to provide the necessaries for a
dinner, those who are suffering from
the cold and sickness, the ladies of the
city and others have organized relief
â¢societies for the collection of food,
clothing and medicine, which have been
and will be distributed to the city's
poor in order that they, too, may give
thanks on this day of appreciation for
God's many works.
And taught' by thee the church prolongs
Her hymns ol high thanksgiving stili.
â Keb>.
The various churches about the city
will hold special services to-day and
jnve Â¦ thanks to God for his bountiful
goodness during the year. The closing
year has been a particularly prosperous
or.e for almost every one. Few cases of
extreme poverty and want have come
to light. Work has been plentiful in all
lines of business, and every one who
would work has enjoyed a good living
in a climate and under conditions un
surpassed anywhere In the United
States.

The British steamship Moana from Sydney,
while entering the Victoria quarantine station
at William Head on Tuesday night, struck on
the rocks where she remained several hours.
She carried away her rudder and sustained
some damage to her hull. The Moana be
longs to the Union Steamship Company and
formerly ran between the Antipodes and thi&
port in connection with the Oceanic Steam
ship Company's Alameda and Mariposa. Cap
tain Carey, the Mo&na's commander, stands
high as a navigator and when coming to this
port was famous for his skill in getting his
ihip alongside the wharf. With the exception
of Captain Seabury. commander of the Korea,
Captain Carey had no equal in this accomplish
ment. He has ripped apart many feet of
Mout wharf structure in his day and has had
Innumerable close shaves, but whatever hap
pened he found his comfort in telling his critics
"You cannot handle a ship unless the is mov
ing. The faster she moves the better she
handles^ and she cannot handle too well Â¦ to
suit me."
Moana Strikes Rocks.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamship New
port, Captain Saunders, -which arrived yester
day from Panama and way ports, left the isth
mus the day before the new republic declared
its Independence. Although the impending rev
olution was casting its shadow over Panama
when the liner left, the Newport's officers had
no idea the change was to come so soon. "You
will hear something from Panama by the time
you get to San Francisco," was as much light
aÂ» the Far.aroaiane volunteered on the subject,
and the story of the revolution, now ancient
history here, was news to the people on the
Newport when they arrived yesterday.
The Newport brought 701 tons of cargo and
treasure valued at $38,475. She brought thirty
five passengers, among whom were the follow
ing named:
Hee Sang, Leon Jim Chow, On Ling, Emma
L. Miller. Maria W. Mather, Victor Mather,
Panteleona Glos, Harry H. Taft, Edith A.
Taft.
Newport Arrives From Panama.
The Japanese steamship Hongkong
Maru, Captain Filmer, which arrived
yesterday from the Orient, was to all
appearances lightly laden, but in splto
of the bulk of her that loomed out'of
the water her hold contained 3000 tons
of valuable merchandise. Of this the
most precious was a shipment of riw
silk, 949 bales of it, worth more than
$600,000. She also brought from Manila
2900 bales of hemp and the second con
signment of the Philippine exhibit for
the St. Louis exposition. This latter
consists of fine hard wood, carved and
modeled sections of a Filipino house,
all ready to be put together by the na
tive artisans already in St. Louis. The
Hongkong also brought from Japan
some similar material for the exposi
tion. Of the Filipino exhibit about 1000
tons more is still to come.
While at Hongkong the liner under
went her Government trial and proved
herself .778 of a knot faster than the
official requirements. She made 17.778
knots and passed a satisfactory inspec
tion in every other respect.
O. G. Freeman, who was purser of
the liner when she left here, resigned
from the service and remained at Ma
nila, where he is now in charge of tho
shipping department of Castle Bros. &
Wolff. Freight Clerk Roberts as
sumed Freeman's duties on the liner
and proved* himself a worthy successor
to one of the best pursers that ever
sailed between here and the Orient.
The Hongkong's passengers included
the folowing named:
From Hongkong â F. E. Eltonhead, ! Lieuten

The circular of Somers &.Co. says of hay:
"Because of tho stormy weather, shipments
of hay have been quite light during the past
week as has also been the demand. The
total * arrivals amount to but 1500 tons. 100
tons lcÂ«s than for the week preceding. The
dealers congregate at the hay cars "each
morning, but most of them go away without
purchasing, preferring to clean out their barns
before buying at the present range of prices.
We cannot but bellevÂ«. howewr, that there
will be no decline for some time to come. Tho
car shortage will bo a very important factor
in maintaining price*, and when cars are sup
plied after the first of the year it is but
reasonable to suppose that the demand will
have been bo improved as to still keep prices
from declining. This, of course, in view of
the fact that country stocks are none too
plentiful to supply our needs until the ad
vent of the new crop. The Government has
Just advertised again for 6000 tons of hay for
Manila. The last order was placed at Seattle,
so it Is expected that this order will be pierced
here In any event our market will probably
bo benefited by the shipment, for in all prob
ability if Puget Sound supplies the hay they
will have to come here to help replenish their
stocks. From all reports, therefore, it would
seem as though the future of the market will
be established at perhaps even higher figures
than the present quotations.
Alfalfa shipments â¢ have about stopped by
w*ter arrivals by schooner now being chiefly
grain- hay from the bay warehouses. Good
wheat hay constitutes the majority of the ship
ments by car with a scarcity of stock hay and
the cheaper grades of horse hay."

tailers were too busy with Turkeys to pay
much attention to fruit. Apples and Pears
moved glowly and other tree fruits met with a
sluggish demand. Small packages of Grapes

ranged lower. The top quotation for crates was
obtained only for strictly fancy lots of fresh
stock. Considerable quantities of carried over
stock were up to peddlers and others
at 40c r<?r crate. Large open boxes from 'Mar
tinez arrived freely and were offering at $1 25fJ
1 M> per box. but did net clean up, having ar
rived too late for the regular trade. Choice,

a fair demand at good prices. The receipts of

offered as low as $2 per chest.
Mexican Limes were reported easy and a

CHICAGO. Nov. 25.â Trading in the wheat
pit to-day was of an evenlng-up character. In
preparation for the holiday to-morrow, and
while there was little general commission
trade there was much adjustment among local
trader*. The only bull news of importance
was the report that there had been general
rains in Argentina and that the Northwest
receipts were lighter than a. year ago, but
this was sufficient to cause a little firmer
feeling early in th* day after a steady open
ing. May was unchanged to Uc lower at thÂ«
start, opening at 7014c to 70%c, and after
hellfng up to 79%c the market became easier
on realizing by local traders. The sentiment
in tho pit was rather bearish the latter half
of the session, the influence belnsj the larger
primary receipts and the easier tone In out
ride markets. There was some selling by yes
terday's buyers and the demand was scattered.
May declined to 7!>c and closed H&He lower
at 79HC December clOBed %c lower at 7!Â»^ic.
Oearances of wheat and flour were equal to
605,100 bushels. Primary receipts were 1,466.
400 bushels, against 1.175.400 a year ago.

ceipts of 7fÂ»G cars, against 61S laet week and
829 a year b;o.
Corn was stronsr for a. few momer.ts Â«t the
Ftart. but there, was too much for sale and
prices soon yielded, the December option be
ing the weaker. May ranged between .41ifce
and 42Hc, closing Â»*<gVic hlcher at 41%(g41%c.
December closed ii(fi%c lower at 4l%ff41%c
Local receipts were 204 cars, with 10 of con
tract grade.
Â¦A slow dragging market, with prices most
of the time under last night's close, was the
order- of the day in the oats pit. May sold
between 34%c and 35%c. closing unchanged
at 35%c December closed a shade lower at
34 1 ,4Â«734%c, lyjcal receipts were 89 cars.
Liberal selling of January lard and ribs by
broken!, supposed to be for the account of
local packers, caused weakness in provisions.
January pork closed 22%c lower, lard was off

The board will be . closed to-morrow on ac
count of Thanksgiving. : â¢

changed rates. Fine grades were firm, but
low and faulty grades were slow and in buy
ers' favor. A good supply of crossbreds was
taken, chiefly by the home trade. Cape of
Good Hope and Natal sold briskly.

Game arrived freely and continued dull at
easy prices. Most of the receipts came to
hand In . poor condition, being 1 more or less
tainted owing to the moist, close weather.
ThÂ« Turkey market continued active despite
thÂ« high prices and the top quotations were
easily obtained for choice lots of live and
dressed stock. Dressed came to hand in all
kinds of packages and it was difficult to arrive
at the exact quantity received as the receipts
were unevenly distributed and came in at all
hours of the day. A conservative estimate
places the receipts at about 125 tons. Some
heavy shipment* that were delayed by an acci
dent to the steamer Solano at Port Costa came
to hand late in the day, but there was no dis
position on the part of dealers to reduce
price*. Small-sized birds constituted a large
portion of the receipts and some very poor
lots were sold below the quotations. There
was very little call for other descriptions of
Poultry and all prices were unchanged and
largely nominal.

tained no surprise for those conversant with
the company's affairs. It may be taken* for
grantM that a well-organized party skillfully
directed the' attack on these tecurities. The
quick -ebound In their prices was sufficient
evidence of this in itself. But there is no
res son to doubt the current reports of a gen
eral sweeping; out of collateral in loans of In
Â¦lustrial i^H^oritiefl, especially of the newer un
digested plaFs. It is fair to bear in mind thfit
the disfavor with which money lenders view
these securities has to do with the readiness
of thÂ» market for them as well as their in
trinsic value and soundness. Many of these
securities have nPV er had a wide market and
â¢Mfcors have loÂ«t much of what they ever had
during the recent period of distrust over the
whole industrial outlook. There Is apparent
also an Intention to adjust the basis of r'lcea
of the whole body of industrials to that of tne
stocks which h.ive already been severely scaled
down. A relative firmness, growing into
ftrensth of thp United States Steel stocks and
of Anialeamtftetf Copper were consonant with
this view. United States Pteel was probably

Potatoes were in ample supply and although
the market was quiet all descriptions of Bur
banks were firmly held at unchanged prices.
The market was overstocked with Sweet Po
tatoes and there was a sharp decline in prices.
Seven carloads came in from Merced. Oniona
ruled firm, at previous rates under light re
ceipts and a steady demand.
There were liberal receipts of vegetables
from Los Angeles and prices of Peas and
Beans ranged lower. Most of the Peas arrived
In poor condition, having been overheated In
transit. Summer Squash, Cucumbers and To
matoes from the same section were in mod
erate receipt and continued to sell at good
figures. With the exception of Tomatoes, the
arrivals of bay Vegetables were moderate and
the previously quoted rates were well sus
tained. There was very little call for To
matoes and there was quite a surplus unsold
at the -close.

Tax Collector Smith yesterday sus
pended W. F. Reardon. a deputy in his
office, for a period of thirty days for al
leged neglect of duty. Reardon's neglect
consisted in failing to stamp as paid

sion followed. Smith says the money
for the taxes was turned over to the

THE LADY'S STOBY.
Miss Dickson freely told her story
last evening to a Call representative,
Â¦who found her at her home, 1112A
In the Federal civil service code there
is no provision that could logically be
interpreted to prohibit fistic resentment
of an oral insult, and knowledge of that
omission may have nerved the good
right arm of Miss Carrie L. Dickson
when she dashed her clenched fist
against the countenance of Tom J. Gil
lispie last Friday evening in the office
of Postofllce Station O, on the mezza
nine floor of the Emporium.
Miss Dickson is the superintendent
of Station O, and Mr. Gillispie was one
of her deputies when the alleged insult
vas punished with the positive assault.
For the lady does not deny that she
emote Mr. Gillispie promptly and hard
just as socn as he had ceased address
ing to her an epithet which is unfit for
publication. And her statement is cor
roborated in every detail by Oscar
Schutte, Miss Dickson's other deputy,
who took up the castigatory exercise
â¢when she ceased and remained in
earnest and active pugilistic argument
with Gillisr>le until that person was
figuratively down and out.
Gillispie confirms the tale of attack,
but pleads tha< his punishment at the
hands of Mis; D'.ckson and Mr. Schutte
v.as utterly unprovoked by anything he
eaicl oi' did. He declares he did not by
either word or deed convey to Miss
Dickson anything thit a sane and tem
perate minded person would construe
as offensive, much less as insulting.
From the three-cornered fabric of
conflictir.gr testimony thus adduced
Postmaster Montague formed his own
conclusions, and vindicated the Diek
pnn-Schutte side of the controversy to
the extent of transferring Mr. Gillispie
to another station.

they had a disagreement October 20,

returned to his folks. The quarrel was
caused by Ncidt's refusal to give up his

rNTERLOCTJTOItY DECREES.
The Kellys live at 357 Hayes street.
They have five grown children. Michael
Kelly, the defendant, is a well-known
retired merchant. From one end cf the
State to the other and all through Ne
vada he is known as "Whisky" Kelly,
a name given him during hi3 connec
tion with the firm of Kelly & Eagan, a
wholesale ilquor concern that existed
here in early days, and out of which
Kelly made a fortune estimated at
$200,000.
Mrs. Kelly also claims that she is
badly in need of the attentions of a
dentist, but that Kelly refuses to allow
her the means. He refused to pay the
bills she had already contracted at a
dentist's and she was compelled to al
low her mouth to remain In a very
sore and distasteful condition. She
asks for a divorce and $230 a month
alimony, claiming that her husband's
wealth is community property.
Five months ago the fortieth wed
ding anniversary of Catherine T. and
Michael H. Kelly was celebrated. Yes
terday Mrs. Kelly commenced divorce
proceedings, charging the man to
whom she was married on June 10,
1863, with treating her cruelly. She
says that for the last three years she
has been an unhappy wife because of
Kelly's brutality, his manner of living
and his lavish expenditure in riotous
living of the fortune he amassed by
years of toil.
The plaintiff alleges that for more
than a year Kelly has not provided for
her and that he has spent his money
lavishly and given vast sums to re
ligious institutions. She says that it
was, in January, 1901, that he first mis
treated her, and that since that time
he has been harsh, cruel and abusive.
She avers that he struck her and
knocked her down then and used vul
gar and insulting language. In Sep
tember of last year, she says, he struck
her because she asked him for J5, and
on several occasions since then has
treated her meanly. She also charges
that though her husband knew that
her eyesight was failing and that she
needed the attention of an oculist he
refused to defray the expense of such
treatment. Informing her when she
asked him to give her money for that
purpose that "she could see too much
already."
ASKS HEAVY ALIMONY.
Miss Dickson volunteered the infor
mation that she had slept very Ht-
In explanation of her request Miss
Dickson stated that the rules . of the
department prohibit fighting within a
postofllce.
"Although," remarked Mr. Schutte,
"the department Is not likely to take
any further notice of an affair In which
a lady simply resented a 'filthy attack
upon her character."
SHE LOSES SLEEP.
"Oh, he got no worse than -he- de
served," Miss Dickson remarked, "and
a little more of the same sort might
not have been superfluous."
Miss Dickson resolutely refused to
disclose what Mrs. Gillispie had said
about her, further than to hint that It
would not look very nice in print.
"I am awfully sorry that the press
has got hold of the miserable incident,"
said Miss Dickson, "and I hope The
Call will Btate very plainly that the
fight did not take place in the office,
but outside in the corridor."
* "Where I dragged Gillispie to," hast
ily put in Mr. Schutte.
"Well, he was as good as put out,"
responded Mr. Schutte, relaxing his
bended arm. "When I let him go Â»he
staggered Aver to the rail and held on
to it, gasping." : \ : -'l r -; Â¦-Â¦.'.
"Of course," resumed Mr. Schutte,
doubling up his right arm and proudly
surveying a bulging bleep, "I knew
that Gillispie was no match for me
physically, so I - satisfied myself by
grasping his throat and shaking all the
combativeness out of him.''
"Did you knock him out?" queried
the interviewer.
"Perfectly right," was the soothing
answer. "Well, when 1 saw him at
tempt to strike back at her I jumped
in and grappled with him. I clutched
his throat and dragged him out of the
office " 'v.v,'
"You did Just splendidly!" exclamed
the lady.
Mr. Schutte coughed modestly as he
took up the narrative.
"It was time for me to interfere," he
said, "and any man worthy of the name
would have interfered. When Miss
Dickson first spoke to Gillispie his
countenance assumed such an expres
sion of rage that I was hardly surprised
when he opened his mouth and spat out
a string of vile epithets. I was about
to interfere then, and had taken a step
toward the fellow when Miss Dickson
struck him "
"Didn't I do right?" eagerly inquired
the lady.
MR. SCHXJTTE'S TALE.
"In the most ladylike manner possi
ble," said Miss Dickson. "I requested
Mr. Gillispie to inform his wife that I
did not want her to visit him at the
office any more, as it was against the
rules to allow strangers to enter there
and because I heard that Mrs. Gillispie
had said some unfavorable things
about me. My language was refined
and my manner courteous as I uttered
the request, and I was about to turn
away, regarding the incident as closed,
Â¦when my ears were assailed by a tor
rent of abuse so filthy lhat impulsive
ly I swung around and struck Gillispie
on the face. Oh, I don't deny that I
struck him as hard as I could, nor do
I hesitate to say that I would do the
same thing again under similar provo
cation."
'How often did you strike him?"
Miss Dickson was asked. '
"I don't know," she replied. "You see
I was so enraged by the foul names he
hurled at me that I struck at him un
til he began to retaliate in kind, and
then Mr. Schutte took the fight off my
hands. I was terribly excited, but I
remember hitting him good and hard
at least once."
"Did he succeed in hitting you in re
turn?"
"I can hardly remember, I was so
excited. But he was coming after me
with both fists clenched and I don't
know what might have happened if Mr.
Schutte had not interfered."
Leavenworth street. In the midst of
her recountal Mr. Schutte dropped in,
and he contributed salient points to the
narrative as It went along.
The police were notified and Detec
tive Gibson placed Ethel under arrest.
Gibson is making inquiry to see if she
has been victimizing other storekeep
ers. She told Gibson she had been liv
ing with a. waiter on Third street, but
declined to give his name or address.
The girl had been employed as a do
mestic by Mrs. A. S. Lichtenstein, 1443
McAllister street, but left on November
1. Two days later she called at the
Lace House, 233 Sutter street, and said
she had been sent by Mrs. Lichtenstein
to purchase some goods. She did not
make any purchases that day, but re
turned on November 5 and selected
goods of the value of $22 90. The sales
man telephoned to Mrs. Lichtenstein,
who said she did not authorize any one
to get the goods for her. The girl asked
to be allowed to speak to Mrs. Lichten
stein, and she so arranged her ques
tions and answers as to convince the
salesman that he had been mistaken,
and she got the goods. The bill was
sent to Mrs. Lichtenstein, and she de
clined to pay it.
Yesterday morning Ethel called at
the Emporium and said she had been
sent by Mrs. Oppenhelmer, Mrs. Liech
tenstein's sister, to buy certain articles.
Mrs. Opperiheimer was called up by
telephone and denied she had sent any
one to make a purchase for her. The
Emporium people had been notified of
the transaction at the Lace House, and
Special Officer Allen took Ethel there
and she was at once identified as the
srirl who had purchased the goods on
November 5.
Ethel Britton, a pretty girl, 19 years
of age, was arrested yesterday morn
ing by Detective T. B. Gibson and
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of obtaining goods by false pretenses.
Her mother lives at 813 Thirteenth
street, Oakland.
The unfortunate young man had
climbed a pole and stood on the sec
ond bracket from the bottom while he
proceeded to adjust some telephone
â¢wires, the electric light wires being be
low him. "While standing on the brack
et he turned aside as if to expectorate
and in so doing moved one of his feet
and touched a live wire. He fell across
the wires and his lifeless body hung
dangling in the air, his knees resting
against the pole and his white face
turned toward the sky. A small cloud
of blue smoke arose from a shower of
electric sparks where the live wire was
in contact with his back.
Mrs. F. "W. Reed of 823 Union street
â¢witnessed the accident. She is the wife
of a lineman and as soon as she saw
what had happened she ran Into Inr
house, got a pair of rubber gloves and
a ladder and placed the ladder against
the pole. Her husband and George Do
lan climbed the pole and took down
the body.
Shortly before Ross was killed and
while he was climbing the pole Mrs.
Reed was talking with Mrs. M. L.
Spine tti and Mrs. Frank Morris, who
were watching Ross at work. One of
the ladles remarked that the business
of a lineman was very dangerous, and
Mrs. Reed said that there was no dan
ger where the workman understood his
business. The words were hardly out
of her mouth when Ross fell dead
across the wires.
The young man was unmarried. The
body was taken to the Morgue.
Bert Ross, a lineman, 2S years of age,
was instantly killed by an electric cur
rent from a live wire on Union street,
between Mason and Taylor, at 9 o'clock
