ROME. Dec. 27. â News has been re
ceived here that Captain Bisco, com
mander of the Italian squadron in
Somaliland, arrived at Obia on the
flagship Cristoforo Colombo, from
which point he sent emissaries to the
interior, having been given to under
stand that the Mullah was disposed to
treat with Great Britain through the
Italians.
The Mullah is believed to be. in an
almbct desperate condition, owing to
the lack of a good base of supplies.
There is, however, no belief in the
pood faith of the Mullah, as it is
thought his alleged disposition tÂ© treat
with Great Britain through the Ital
iÂ«m officers is merely a strategem to

The Times* Peking correspondent,

Japan's activity in the acquisition. of

The Dally Mail's Kobe correspondent
asserts that the Japanese army : author-

when asked concerning the alleged
statements attributed to him, which
were given so much publicity recently
by Colonel Jones, regarding the pro
phecy he had made In Honolulu of a
clash of arms between the Unitell
States and Germany in the near future,
his manner suddenly changed and,
drawing himself up to his full height,
he firmly said: "I positively decline to

his hand, he dismissed the subject and
swept It aside as a thing of the past.

General MacArthur was much in

and one . of his first questions was:
"What is the latest news of the Japan
war question?" When Informed of the
situation, he changed the subject with
out comment and went on with a fur
ther account of his visit to the islands.
When asked if there was any truth in
the report that his visit to the islands
had been cut short, by reason of the
Government cabling him to return to
his post to be,in command here, should
the affairs in Panama come to a crisis,
he replied: -

The Roses came to this city from St.

was without employment, and the cou
ple are said to have quarreled fre
quently.
SALT LAKE, Dec. 27.â With the
statement that he had murdered his
wife, Frank Rose, a barber, surrendered
himself at police headquarters early
to-day and asked that he be locked up.
He raid that he had killed his wife on
Christmas afternoon, and that the body
â¢was still lying on the bed where tthe
Tveman had died, after lingering fot
two hours with a pistol bullet in her
brain.
An investigation by the police re
vealed a deplorable condition of affairs
at the scene of the murder. Lying un a
bjs-A in a miserably furnished Third
South street shack, the body of Mts.
Rose was found, clad in her undergar
ments, and by her side was the
woman's 2-year-old son, the baby's
clothing being saturated with the
mother's bl^od. It was at first thought
that the child Â»as dead, but when an
officer attempted to release the little
arms fnftn around the dead woman's
Epck, the babe began to ciy and plain
tively told the policeman that some
thing nas the matter with its mamma,
ar.<i that "she won't wake up."
For almost two days the child had
been locked in the cold room with the
murdered woman, without food or at
tention of -Â«ny kind. The child is in a
serious condition, but, it is thought, will
rÂ«Â»cover.
So the Finance Committee passed the
bill more than a week ago. and the
board itself passed it, but it did not es

REPORTED TO ASSESSOR.
That the City Council of Oakland was
not trapped as was the Board of Su
pervisors is due to Chairman John L.
Howard of the Finance Committee of
that organization and Chairman Dor
nin. These two gentlemen thought that
they. discovered a "nigger in the wx>d
pile" and refused MacMullan's offer.
MacMullan wrote some letters to the
Council that Dornin and Howard re
fused to receive on the ground that
they were scurrilous in their nature,
and at that moment MacMullan's prop
osition went a-glimmering. Now the
Councilmen are happier than the Su
pervisors.
While the story did not leak out from
the Supervisors until yesterday, the
matter has been under investigation by
them for more, than a week, and the
members of that board have been ap-"
palled at the position in which they
found themselves. The bill that broke
the news to them so forcibly was pre
sented more than a week ago. It -did
not. take the men who are so well ac
quainted with the affairs of Alameda
County very long to discover that they
would have something more to face
than the mere bill of $1099 15 then be
fore them. They sent for District At
torney Allen and County Assessor Dal
ton to appear before the meeting of the
Finance Committee one week ago yes
terday, but they. got very little comfort
from either official.
District Attorney Allen told them that
they would have to pay the bill.
Then they asked County Assessor
Dalton how it was that $5,000,000 worth
of property had gone unassessed for
years and whether he had placed this
property upon the rolls as the result of
the labors of MacMullan. The County
Assessor replied that It was upon the
information furnished by MacMullan
that the property got upon the rolls,
and that the property had been so deft
ly hidden that with the limited, force
and limited time -at his command he
had not been able to discover it him
self.
The Supervisors and various county
officials of Alameda County are begin
ning to wonder where an apparently in
nocent agreement entered into between
C. S. MacMullan and the Board of Su
pervisors is going to lead them. The
indications are that it will lead them
to an enforced payment of something
in the neighborhood of $33,000 to Mac-
Mullan, though they all say they did
not expect that he would make more
than a few hundred dollars at the most.
But while the Supervisors are trying
to explain how they were trapped into
this.agreement the City Council of Oak
land is felicitating itself upon the fact
that It did not fall into MaoMullan's
trap and that they refused to accept his
offer whenÂ»he made it to them at about
the same time he made it to the Super
visors. Had the City Council done as
did the Supervisors, MacMullan would
have had claims against the city, and
county aggregating more than 560,000
for a few weeks' work.
But this is not all of the scandal that
is likely to aiise from this matter.
There are hints of actions that are usu
ally described by the ugly word "black
mail," and one member of the Board of
Supervisors b.asJ t eÂ«Â£ers in. his possession
from the highest^ officials of the South
ern Pacific Company that go to show
that this information,' which was sold
to the county of Alameda upon
a percentage basis, was. offered to
that corporation. When it is consid
ered that the bulk of this alleged "un
assessed" property consists of the fran
chises of the Southern Pacific Company,
Oakland Gas Light and Heat Company,
Contra Costa Water Company and like
corporations and the personal property
of the same corporations, the opportuni
ties for such actions are manifold.

"It has been trouble, trouble, for a
long time over money. It began four
years ago, when Mrs. Garth refused to
mm against her sister, my wife, in the
settlement of their father's estate. Sile
stood for what was right, for the pro
tection of her own interests and her
sister's, and she won her battle. A
week ago last Friday the suit was de
cided in her favor. The next day Mr.
Garth left- New -York, a disappointed,
defeated man. Providence, I believe,
has acted as the highest court."
Alexander A. Orr. vice president of
the bank, said to-day that for some
time past Garth had been far from
well and within the past few weeks
had seemed to be on the verge of men
tal prostration. For this reason the
board of directors passed, December
14, a .resolution urging Garth to take
a vacation of four months. To thl3
Garth assented and sailed with a com
panion on* the Denver on December 19.
The bank had continued to prosper
under Garth's management, Orr said.
and his death was solely due to mental
anxiety of a purely personal character.
"Possibly; I don't know. But what of
that? I have bought property in other
persons' names, and so has almost
everybody else. I bought a farm on the
coast of Maine last year in another
man's name because there were busi
ness reasons for doing so. It was or^
might hive been the same case with
Mrs. Garth.

NEW YORK, Dec. 27.â The Mechan
ics' Bank directors having declared
President Garth's suicide due to pure
ly personal troubles, friends -of the
bank president are at a loss to account
for his action. The only trouble of any
domestic nature concerns the discharge
of Hubert Hartigan, a handsome young
riding master, who was employed by
Garth to handle his horses and give
riding lessons to Mrs. Garth, who un
der his tuition has become a daring and
accomplished horsewoman. After Hart
igan's discharge he purchased a fln^
farm near Morristown, N. J., paying
for it a large sum. He had not been
regarded as a man of means.

own name, having inherited several
millions from her father. McComb, a

so. There was some trouble with the

CHICAGO, Dec. 27.â Preparatory to
leaving for Australia, John Alexander
Dowie bade farewell to his' Chicago ad
herents at a meeting in the Auditorium
to-day. Standing-room was at a pre
mium. After an all-night "watch meet
ing" in Zlon City New Year's eve Dowie
will leave for New Orleans and will
travel to San Francisco via the South
western route, stopping at various large
cities en route. He intends to sail from
the latter port January 21' and 'counts
on being back in Chicago next June.
"I am going to leave everything in
Zion City and not steal away with either
the lace works or the temple," said
Dowie. "That was a malicious lie about
my wife taking $7,000,000; but I am fool
ish to deny it again. I will take only
enough cash for spending money."
J>OWIE STARTS ON
TIIIP TO AUSTRALIA
Meanwhile MacMuIlan stands upon
his assertions that the tlaim is legal,
and he frankly says that his total
claims will be in the neighborhood of
$35,000, and if he don't get : the money
he is going to' sue for it.
Some of the "discovered" property
consists of the so-called franchise upon
the ferry system of the Southern Pa
cific Company. This was struck off the
rolls of Alameda County, but was al
lowed to .stand upon the rolls of San
Francis6o County. Mr. MacMuIlan
calmly announces that if the assess
ment is sustained by fhe courts of San
Francisco he is going to sue Alameda
County "for his half of the taxes 'due
this county, whether it collected the
taxes or not. " Â¦â¢>" ' .*â¢â¢Â¦â¢â¢
Meanwhile the people are wondering
why it is- that it is so easy to slip
schemes of this kindt through public
bodies, and it is very^evident that the
Supervisor* will havejto make a com
plete Investigation -in "order to furnish
a proper explanation.
The attention of Auditor Bacon -was
first called to this claim by the First
National Bank of Berkeley, which tele
phoned to him and asked him if such a
claim would be allowed if 'presented.
vAuditor Bacon scented a mouse and
informed the bank that he would not
allow it. It then transpired that Mac-
MuIlan had been endeavoring to dis
count the claim at several places, that
he had applied to J. B. Lanktree, who
refused it, and then he tried the Berke
ley bank, which telephoned to Auditor
Bacon and then refused to handle it.
BANK NOT, SATISFIED.
I certainly did not'Â«<jtpÂ»Ct that MacMulIan-n
I claim would amount to-tso large a figure. 'When
his proposition first cam*' before us. and";! am
| not prepared to say at this timÂ» what- will be
| done. I was not present at the meeting of
j'th? finance committee that passed the bill
'and whm I voted for it I "undertstdod that It
' had beÂ«-n checked up by the county -eacrjert and
; thrtt Distrirt Attorney All^n said that we had
| to pay it and Coynty Assessor D^Hon hadvip-
I proved it as legal.â The matter will have to' be
investigated. .
Supervisor J. M. Kelley is another
.whoLdid not expect that MacMuIlan was
going to make'sjo large an amount as
?35,000. He says:. I
There has been a trap laid somewhere.': arid
if there has been >.">.00<j,0O<> worth of property
in this rounty escaping taxation we ousbt tu
kni.w XYhr-" ' V '
Supervisor H. X). Rowe says that
when the MacMuIlan agreement was
presented it. was not expected that his
commission would .amount to more
than $500 or J6Q0, but he is Inclined to
think, the county can be. held- for the
claims. He said:
I am- afraid vre will be bound by our apree
â¢ment, either as a Board of Suivrvlsors or as
Individuals. We- certainly made an agree
m'nt wittr "Mr. MarMu'lsn, ' though I must
confess I did not believe at the time that he
would maice more, than $r>00 or $600 out of it.
We only aKrted to.jrive him half of the taxes
upon property that he discovered had escaped
taxation for three years or moro. â¢ In this
refpert he was a eort of county exr>ert. who
checked vp books. We called "Mr. Daltcn. the
County Anecpor. before us. and he said that
Mr. MacMuIlan's claim was correct and that
â¢the r,ronÂ»rtjr that MacMuIlan had discovered
had escaDfd his notice. I am afraid that we
owe the money, though I have no idea as to
the amount. i Â¦
pascage would furnish a basis for the payment
of others. The other bills will be most .care
fully examined into. The understand in >r that
I had of thÂ«* contract with -MacMullan was
that he was to report all discovered unas
Â¦r s^ed properties to the Board of Supervisors,
and if wu considered that they were genuine
discoveries w^ irouM allow him his commis
sion upon the taxes collected. Instead of that
he has retxjrtfd rII these 83-caJled discoverteH

CAUSE OF. LITIGATION
The present -expectation at the Treas
ury Department is that tlÂ« banks will
be drawn on for a considerable part of
the cajial money. The payments prob
ably will be made just at the season of
the year when thÂ»* funds withdrawn
from the money centers for crop mov
ing purposes- are flowing back in large
volurijS? and when, consequently, a de
crease in the Government deposits in
the bjanks can be made with the least'
disturbance to business.
As '-a matter of fact, if the payments
are me6>e at a time when Europe owes
the United States, the purchase money
will not be immediately withdrawn from
circulation in this country. The pay
ments' to the French company and the
republic of Panama will be merely
transactions in the International ex
change market.
With an available cash balance of
$226,803,i:S at the command of the Sec
retary Of the Treasury, with $165,132,955
of this amount loaned to banks without
ir;tÂ»*Test, and with the current receipts
of the Government running ahead of
the expenditures, it is not probable that
the administration on the eve of the.
Presidential election will yield to the
Â¦wishes of certain financial interests and
increase the interest-bearing debt of
the Tnited States $50,000,000 to meet
the Panama canal payments. These
payments- of. $40,000,000 t> the French
car.al company and $10,000,000 to the re
public of Panama will be made imme
diately after the ratification of the
pending -treaty. . by the United States
Senate. â¢ *" Â¦ -
Though- Secretary. Shn'w has ( not.yet
made any statement as to how he pro
poses to make the payments, it can be
said ihat'he has no present intention of
if suing' bonds. On the contrary, he has
already begun preparations for mak
lr.g v the payments direct from the Treas.
tiri". His first step was to augment the
available cash balance by gradually, re
ducing the funds set apart to the credit
of the various disbursing officers of the
Government, which were far in excess
of their immediate requirements. .' In
this way about $3,000,000 has been added
to the available cash balance. This
pmcAss will be continued until at least
510.000,000 more shall have been added to
the. available cash, bringing it up to
abrt'u't 5236,000,<OW. s

; VICTORIA. . B. ' C, Dec. Â¦ 27.â The
steamer Shinano Maru which arrived

Singapore/ which is vouched for by
Shanghai papers, of. the narrow escape
of the .German mail" liner Prinz Hein
r.ich, frorrr being blown up by a subma
rine mine.
â¢ When the steamer was leaving Singa
pore during the early part of Novem
ber 1 a steam launch with a large party
of British naval bfflcers on board
steamed toward her, and the British
naval men shouted excitedly:
"You are in great danger. Right be
fore you is a submarine mine. For
God's sake go astern, full speed!"
Captain Heintzer, realizing that his
vessel had too much way to stop, quick
ly steamed ahead, hoping to get over
the danger spot. Suddenly the mine
exploded abdut two lengths astern with
a tremendous roar, throwing up the
water with a great splash.

The present first class of the United
States Naval Â¦ Academy, consisting of
sixty-fK'e members, is to come up for
examination for graduation on->Febru
ary 1, which' is four months earlier than
usual. It is a foregone conclusion that
the entire class % will p&as 'and be as
signed to service on cruising ships, as
the navy is short of junior officers. Two
years hence they will be examined for
promotion to ensigns, the interval being
a probation-to establish* their fitness for
the service. On March' 1 there >will be
250 vacancies at the naval ac'ademy, fdr
which there Will be no less than 1000
candidates, and the "cramming" schools
are doing a good busines in Washing
ton and other large cities at rates vary
ing, from $2 to {I, an hour. Some im
portant ch'anges in thie regulations for
admission to the naval academy will go
Into effect in 1904. â¢* The minimum age
is raised from 15 years to 16 years, but
the maximum remains at 450 years. The
minimum height was hitherto five feet
regardless of age: now the candidates
who are between 16 and 18 years ofd
must be flve'feet two inches, and' those
between 18 and 20 years must be five
feet four inches in height. y
There will be twenty retirements qn
account of age in the navy during 1904,
namely, eight rear admirals, one com
mander, one medical director, three
pay directors, one naval constructor,
The armored cruiser Victor Hugo, a
duplicate of the Leon Gambetta, is be
ing rapidly built at L'Orient dockyard.
The keel was laid last March, and the
ship is calculated to be completed dur
ing 1905. Its cost, including armament,
is $5,800,000.
The Turkish cruiser Abdul Medjid.
built by Cramp's, made a successful
trial December 19, making 22.4 knots in
one hour and averaging twenty knots
during a run of six hours. The latter
performance just covers the contract
stipulations and is all that could be ex
pected. In the General Information Se
ries issued by the office of naval intelH T
gence. Washington, it was erroneously
stated that the speed of this cruiser
was to be twenty-four knots with 12,000
horsepower. The official who compiled
this data evidently overlooked the fact
that a vessel of 3200 tons required not
less than 16,000 horsepower to drive her
at a- speed of twenty-four knots, as
shown in the trials of the Russian
cruiser Novik. The Abdul Medjid is
3277 tons displacement, 330 feet length,
42 feet beam and 15Â»4 feet draught, car
rying two six-inch, eight 4.7-inch and
six 1.8-fnch guns. The speed of nearly
22 1 /& knots is a, creditable performance;
not likely to be exceeded by the Abdul
Hamid, a sister ship, under construc
tion at Elswick, which was launohed
two months ago.
NEED OF JUNIOR OFFICERS. ;
The French Minister of Marine lias
obtained consent of the Chamber of
Deputies to materially change the de
sign of the Ernest Renan, an armored
cruiser, to be built by contract at La
Seyne. As first planned this ship was
to be a duplicate of the Leon Gambetta,
building at Brest, which is of 12,550
tens, 26,000 horsepower and twenty-two
knots speed. The new plans provide
for a vessel of 18,562 tons, 28,000 horse
ower and twenty-three knots speed,
and a main battery of two 9.45-inch and
twelve 6.48-inch guns, against four 7.63
inch and sixteen 6.4S-inch carried in the
Leon Gambetta. The cost of the latter
is estimated at $5,720,000, which will be*
increased to $6,200,000 in the new ship.
Thornycroft at Chiswick. England, is
building four large tornedo boats for
the British navy. The first of. these,
named Kennet, was launched December
4. The boats are 540 tons displacement,
7000 horsepower and contracted to aver
age 25!4 knot3' during, a.,, four-hours'
run, carrying a load of 125 tons. They
are Â£25 feet in length, 23 feet lO 1^ inches
beam. and 10 feet 2 inches draught, and
carry an armament of one 12-pounder
and five 6-pounder.s. . . .,
The totals include ships* building. The
chief conditions would work out- as fol
lows: Great Britain and Japan, 74
ships of 974,000 tons, against France and
Russia combined of 6S ships of 741,000
tons, or Germany and Russia 65 ships,
of 745,000 tons.
In the purchase of the two Chilean
battleships, Constitucion and Libertad,
the British navy has acquired* ships
that are superior to any turned out in
any navy on a like displacement. The
new ships, although only of 11,800 tons,
are far superior to' the Canopus class
of six shins of 12,950 tons, built two
years ago, which averaged in cost ?4,
500.000, with guns aboard and ready for
sea. The price paid for the two Chil
ean ships was $4,680,000 for each. The
trial speed of the Canopus class aver
aged 18.25 knots, whereas' the Chilean
ships made 20 knots' and one of them,
tile Libertad, steamed at an average
speed of 17Â»4 knots for twenty-seven
consecutive hours. The Constitucion
was built at Elswick and the Libertad
at Barrow. The ships are identical in
all essential particulars, carrying main
batteries qf four 10-inch and fourteen
7.5 inch guns, while the Canopus class
of vessels each have an armament of
four 12-inch and twelve' 6-inch guns.
The armor belt has a maximum thick
ness of 7 inches in the Chilean ships
against 6 inches in the Canopus class,
and the coal capacity of 2000 tons ex
ceeds that of the British ships by 150
tons. .The Constitucion and Libertad
will probably be sent to the China sta
tion, for which service their draught
of less than twenty-five feet makes
them preferable to larger battleships.
FOUR BIG TORPEDO BOATS.'
The aim of Great Britain to possess a
battleship navy equal to that of two
other powers is Â¦ involving a vast out
lay of money, but the position is as
sured, for the time being at least, by
the purchase of the Chilean vessels
Constitucion and Libertad. The pres
ent relative standing of the several
navies in battleships and tonnage dis
placement is' shown in the foregoing
table: â¢
The time is not " far off when the
navy will require a number of high
speed cruisers. It is probable that Con
gress will authorize the building of
three battleships which, when com
pleted in 1908, will give us twenty
eight battleships. These, with the thir
teen armored cruisers, including three
erroneously classified as protected
cruisers, will constitute quite a for
midable fighting fleet, but in the mean
time no provision is being made for im
proving and increasing the cruiser
class. The present lot is an illy assort
ed number. . of vessels of different
types and out of date, wliich require
almost entire reconstruction in order
to be as efficient as those of other
naval powers. The Atlanta and Bos
ton are nearly twenty years old; the
Baltimore, Newark and San Francisco
were built about fourteen years ago;
the Cincinnati, Raleigh, Columbia and
Minneapolis, were disappointments as
to speed; the Albany and New Orleans,
bought abroad, while .good ships, do
not compare with similar types built
in â¢ Germany, which are two knots
faster, and the Denver class of six
ships have no . counterparts in any
bther navy where six knots greater
speed has been obtained on a like dis
placement. Nineteen ships, consti
tuting the protected cruiser class, is
divided into nine distinct types, only
three, of which the Olympia, Albany
and New Orleans, may be counted on
as being able to- make twenty knots for
a brief run at an emergency. The other
cruisers "range from fourteen "to
eighteen knots, which. When compared
with English, French. German, Ital
ian' and Russian-- ships of that class;
places the United States navy at the
foot Of the list. *

PHOENIX,- Ariz., Dec. 27.â Two das
tardly murders are reported from
Brush Hollow, near Glsela, in that sec
tion of Gila County known as Tonto
Basin, the scene of .the bloody war
some years ago between -the cattlemen
and sheepmen. One of the victims is a
24-year-bld Bon of a sheepman named
Berry, and the other is a Mexican boy,
aged 17, son of a sheep herder with the
Berry outfit.
The men were alone at the time,
though a third man witnÂ°ssed the sup
posed murderer riding a*\ ay from the
place. A goat herder in that vicinity is
suspected by some, but more people in
cline to; the belief that the crime was
committed by some offended cattleman.
Hundreds of themsands of sheep are
driven each winter from Northern Ari
zona to the vicinity of Phoenix for
shearing and driven back in the spring.
Most of them pass through the Tonto
Basin, the cattlemen contending to tlie
detriment of their ranges. In the Tun
to Basin war fifty lives are known to 1
have been sacrificed, and many proba
bly were killed of whom there >vas
never official knowledge. Both sid'is
lost about equally.
Clashes between the factions have
since occurred but seldom. It was
thought the situation has been that of
an armed truce, and fear is expressed
that this incident is another outbreak
against the sheepmen, there bein^
known Jiere no local cause for the
tragedy. Officers of that locality are
active and the murderer may now be in
custody, as it is a hundred miles from
a telegraph station. The murders oc
curred December 22.

OREGON CITY, Or.. Dec. 27.â The
alleged theft of a silver spoon from a
local saloon late last night very near
ly delayed the departure from thi3 city
of the Starrford University Glee and
Mandolin clubs. Following the enter
tainment by the collegiate organiza
tions at the armory and while the
members were awaiting the departure
of the last car to Portland, some of
the collegians entered a saloon and
ordered a round of drinks. Simul
taneously with their departure an
ornate silver spoon disappeared.
The enraged saloon man gave chase
and overtook his customers at their
hotel. He demanded that they pro
duce the spoon, but they did not and
would not try. A policeman appeared
on the scene and the saloon man Indi
cated the student who had been hand
ling the spoon at the bar. The police
man searched him against the vocifer
ous protests of the other musical col
legians, but without; avail. The liquor
dealer insisted that the whole glee
club be searched, claiming that his
bartender had seen them take ' the
spoon, but the policeman refused to
undertake the job and the musicians
departed on th'eir train. i

turned out, some cm foot and others on
horreback. but carriages were conspic
uous by their absence.
The Chinefe Masons made arrange
ments for 350 carriages at *ihe rate c f
f7 each, but at the last minute the
harkmen raiped their prices. A con
sultation was held and the Celestials
decided to walk rather than stand the
additional tariff.
RICH DISPLAY OF COLOR.
The remains of the late Kow Kan
Gouey, vice president of the Chee Kong
Tong, or Chinese Free Masons, were
laid to rest yesterday afternoon with
Oriental ceremonies befitting a man
of his rank. The funeral services were
of an elaborate character and were par
ticipated in by thousands of Chinese,
many of v.hom carne from distant
places to pay homage to a man whose j
name was familiar to every Chinaman
from Maine to California.
For thirty days the corpse of Kow
Kan Gouey lay in state at the head- J
quarters of the powerful association !
in Spofford alley. During that time :
thousands of his countrymen viewed j
his remains, and music was played at !
his casket end punks were burned j
there day and night, so that the infiu- ;
ences of the evil spirit might be ban- J
ished forever.
Kow Kan Gouey died nearly a month |
ago at the age of 71 years. His life :
i had beon an ideal one, according to the ;
idea of the Celestial, and during his i
long: reisrn as an officer of the Chinese j
Free Masons and a Chinatown mer- j
i chant his reputation traveled to other !
I climes and other lands, and accordingly, j
; trhen he was called by death, his loss j
j was felt throughout the length and
i breadth of the land.
It is the custom of the Chinese to do
! great honor to their dead, and when
j the news of the demise of Kow was
! spread over the country many of the I
j prominent Masons in the larger cities
i Ficrnlfled their intention of attending
i the funeral services. It was impossible I
for them to make the long trip at that
: time, so, after a d^al'of consultation,
it was finally decided to postpone the
funeral service for one month, so that
Chinamen in other States might have
a chance to attend.
MAXY NOTABLES PRESENT.
Nearly every State in the Union was
represented at the funeral. Large dele- '
nations came from all the cities of the
Northwest and Canada. Some came
from as far as Mexico, while numbers
made the journey from New York and
Chicago. In all, several hundred prom
inent Celestials from all over the coun
try took part in the burial services.
The hour set for the big parade to
start from the headquarters of the
long was 11 o'clock, but by 9 in the
morning the streets near the place were
thronged with Orientals and Occi
dentals all eager for a glimpse at the
gaudily robed Masons as they passed
in and c-ut of thÂ» building.
When the hour of noon was at hand
Chinatown was crowded as 't has not
been in >-e-ns. Every street where the
j>rooofsion was to pass was iiikd and
an extra squad of police was n<>ces
t-ary to keep the immense crowd in'
chtck.
In the grave with the coffin were low
ered a large portrait of the dead man.
together with several packages of
charms, all of which are supposed to
drive away the evil spirit. Before the
body was lowered into the grave n.11
the mourners advanced near the coffin
in pairs and bowed in prayer.
The parade took in all the principal
streets of Chinatown and was more
than an hour passing along its route
there. It then wended its way down
Kearny street to Market, but by the
time the latter thoroughfare was
reached most of the paraders had
dropped out and only a small number
followed the coffin to Fifth and Market
streets, where it was put on a car and
sent on Its way to the Chinese Cemetery
below Colma.
A peculiar feature of the funeral was
t^at very fev,- of the mourners followed
the body to the grave. Less Â¦ than a
hundred persons made the journey,
most of the mourners^Jjeing apparently
content with participating in' the pa
rade"* and the ceremonies at the head
quarters of the tong. '..â¢.".
The cervices at the grave were long
and imposing. The remains were taken
to the highest point of the cemetery
and "there laid to rest- with the usual
ceremonies that attend a Celestial of
note. The roast pig and the burning
punks were laid by the coffin and the
death prayers were chanted by the offi
cers of the order.
Then followed warriors bearing huge
spears, guns and battle axes. Behind
them marched more musicians, and the
rear of this wonderful procession was
made up of Chinamen in the ordinary
walks of life who simply marched
along, chattering among themselves as
they went.
MARCH THROUGH CHINATOWN".
Behind the hearse marched another
delegation of honored citizens, all car
rying lighted punks and banners.
Others blew notes on weird horns and
still others clanked their cymbals and
beat uncanny tunes on Oriental drums,
so that the evil one might be kept at a
distance.
and was several blocks long. It was
headed by an American brass band,
playing a death march and next in
line was a Â«ruard of honor on horre
back. the riders clad in flowing robes of
wondrous colors and carrying immense
flaps and emblems.
Then came a detachment of promi
nent members, of the tong cm foot.
There, like the riders, were gowned in
striking costumes, some carrying fans
and others flags, banners and shiskls.
After these marched a Chinese band,
playing a death march accompanied by
the clang of cymbals.
Then followed the riderless horse, an
immense black steed, the head of which
was completely covered with black
crape. The steed was followed by an
other band and more riders and after
these 'the hearse, drawn by six coal
black horses.

j WASHINGTON. Dec. 27.â It is said
\ here that the reason for the removal
at this time of the body of the founder
of the Smithsonian Institution from
Genoa to this country is that a stone
quarry .has encroached on the English
cemetery at Genoa to such an extent
that it has become necessary to remove
the remains interred there. Bell left
this country a little more than a week
ago. Congress has made no appropria
tion for the removal of Smithson's re
mains to this country, and it could not
be learned to-night, owing to the ab
sence of Professor Langley from the
city, whether the regents of the Smith
sonian Institution had voted money for
this purpose or Bell was acting on his

âA gang of five bank robbers looted
the bank in Kiowa, a small town six
teen miles north of here, at 3 o'clock
this morning and escaped after several
hundred shots had been exchanged be
tween the robbers and a posse of fifty
citizens cf Kiowa.
The robbers dynamited the safe and
secured about J2S00 In cash, some of
which is believed to have been muti
lated by the explosion. The bank
building was partially wrecked, the
damage to the building being about
51500. . Â¦ â¢ .-
An entrance to the bank was gained
by the use of crowbars through a rear
window. While two of the men did the
work of blowing the safe, three stayed
outside as guards. The first explosion
was a failure, making a loud report
but doing little damage. The citizens
heard the noise and, arming themselves
with revolvers and shotguns, hurried to
the bank. At the command of a leader
of the citizens a volley was fired at the
robbers, who were visible through the
shutters. The fire was returned by the
guards secreted on the outside.
While the two men on the inside
worked, the three men on the outside
kept up a steady fire with the posse
of citizens. It took three explosions to
open the safe.
After the last explosion the burglars
gathered up their tools and, leaving
through the front of the bank, got
away in the dark. The posse followed
the gang for a distance but lost the
trail. While some of the citizens be
lieved one robber was injured, not one
of the citizens was struck. The latter
were protected from the fire of the
robbers by stock pens in the rear of
the bank building.
A posse of United States marshals is
in pursuit with little chance of imme
diate results, as the men had several
hours' start.

An explosicn of illuminating gas at 3
L.ily terrace last night at 7:30 o'clock
caused an alarm to be turned in from
box 133. After the incipient blaze had
been extinguished Joseph Keating was
found cold in doath by Ms mother, as
the result of gas asphyxiation.
Shortly after 7 o'clock last night Mrs.
M. Keating: and Miss Virginia Keating,
her daughter, returned to this city
nfter a visit of several days wi'.h
friends in Pinole. Arriving at their resi
dence. 3 L'ly terrace, they opened the
front d^or and detected the odor of ga.s.
Mrs. Keating instituted a search and
found the odor to be strongest near thvÂ»
door to her eon's room. Striking a
match shÂ» opened the door and a deaf
ening explosion followed. Henry "Vas
ter, who resides in the immediate vi

The department promptly responded
and extinguished a blazing curtain and
pome smoldering woodwork. After the
departure of the firemen Mrs. Keating
and her daughter visited the 6cene of
the explosion and were horrified to find
the body of the son and brother lyins
dead in bed.
Apparently he was in bed when over
taken by death, as his clothes were
found neatly arranged on a chair n?ar
the bed. It is supposed that the un

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 27.â In a clump
of bushes which screened it from view
from every point except to within a few
feet away, the body of a man waa
found near .the northwestern boundary
of the city this morning by two small
boys who were hunting rabbits. At
first it was supposed that it was the
body of a suicide, but investigation by
the city detectives, to whom the boys
reported their find, disclosed unmistak
able evidence of murder. Who the vic
tim was. what the motive and who
killed him are matters which have not
as yet been established and the case la
surrounded by mystery.
The body is that of a man of about
forty years of age and he waa evi
dently a laborer, for it was rough
ly dressed and the hands were rough,
indicating that the man had been
accustomed to hard work. There was
not a scrap of paper in his pockets or
anything else by which any clew to his
identity could be discovered. Had the
crime been committed by a maniac,
greater butchery could not have been
done. The weapon used -was evidently
an ax and with it nearly a dozen blows
were delivered, any one of which would
have been sufficient to have caused
death. ' The head of the dead man was
literally chopped to pieces.
The right arm was broken and there
were bruises about the body showing
that the man had made a desperate re
sistance and that it was only after he
had been knocked down that the mur
derer finished him with blows on the
head.
The scene of the murder is in a sec
tion of the city in which there is not
a house within a quarter of a mile.
Near the body were found torn scraps
of an envelope which when pasted to
gether gave the detectives a name and
address, but what it is the officers have
refused to make public.
The pockets of the dead man were
turned inside out and there was no
money on the body. The officers are
not yet ready to accept robbery as the
theory of the murder because no rob
ber wculd have found it necessary to
chop his victim to pieces in the manner
in which this murderer did. The man
had been dead less than twelve hour*
but no person has been found who saw
strangers in that part of the city last
night.

THANKS ARE GIVEN.
The question has often presented itself- to
me, "Do we think enough of the men who
foueht and bled and died for that flag?" and
It is with deep regret that I am compelled to
answer "So." Many of us have forgotten that
these men who fought for the cau:-> e have a
great claim upon this country whose unity
they preserved. They faced danger and en
dured hardship without a murmur, thinking
always of the flag under which they nerved.

the Emperor, who had been shot in the heart

touching incidents of the Civil War
which had come under his personal no

wherein the nation's dead may aleeo undis
turbed beneath the Stars and Stripes, ' under
which they fought and for which they gave
their lives. I also wish to thank Captain
Ludwig Slebe, who save the flag which will
be raised during the exercises to-day. The
flagstaff was secured by Appomattox 1'ost and
is set In seven feet of concrete. It will last

John Hancock, Samuel Adams and Robert
Treat l'alne, signers of the Declaration of In

who built the cradle of liberty at Boston,
and from the grave of our third martyred
President, William McKtnley.

The most of the sell used in the cere
monies was collected by Major. Edwin
A. Sherman, who sent a letter express
ing his regret at being unable to be
present at the dedication. The letter
was read by Captain 'Thomas. After

OAKLAND, Dec. 27. â After she had
passed the half-century mark and had
launched into the world a family of
children, Mrs. Ann Healy decided to
day that she would lay down the bur

have been prettier than the living "buds" who,
garbed lti dainty frocks of every hue, pre
sented a most attractive picture.

"heart" and the "Santa -KJiavta." The. favors
for the first figure were small wand*, with

EVENTS IN SOCIETY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY.
The westbound engine drove through
No. 6"s engine like a wedge, separating
the gear from the boiler and standing
the latter on end like a broken, twisted
shell. The running gear was crumpled
up like so much twine. Great cast steel
side rods were bent into many shapes,
and even the steel tires of the big driv
ing wheels were split and sprung from
the wheels, landing in some cases ten
feet from the engine. The boiler of en
pine No. 297 turned over several time?,
and the very force of the twisted impact
seems to have been the means of so.v
ing the life of Engineer Waterman- He
was flung forty feet over the fence at
the edze of the right of, way. Moon,
his fireman, was sitting on the opposite
side of the cab, and he, too, was thrown
clear of the pile of wreckage.
As the trains came together the
steam domes of each boiler blew oil,
releasing their contents, else there
would have been added horrors from
the blistering steam.
No. 6, cast bound, was composed of a
mail and baggage car, combination
6moker, buffet parlor car, day 'coach
and diner. The baggage car. caught be
tween the engine and heavy train, was
crumpled like pasteboard, only the roof
remaining partially unbroken. The big
blind mail coach, heavily bulkheaded,
took the brunt of the blow, but with
stood the crash and communicated It to
the smoker next to it in the rear. The
smoker was swept clean, as the mall
car telescoped its entire length . and
turtied over at the north side of the
track. The smoker In turn crashed .sev
eral feet into the parlor car and it was
at the rear end of. the smoker, and. for- 1

The wreck is charged to the hi?h
wind, which extinguished the red sig
nal light in the 'â¢order" board at Mc-
Cords Station, where the westbound
train was expected to stop and receive
orders. When train No." 5. bound west,
whizzed past McCords instead of step
ping, the frightened operator notified
the dispatcher and then found that his
red liKht had been extinguished. He re
ported this fact, and then there was
tut ore action to take. The collision
vras Inevitable. The dispatcher's office
called for medical aid and gave orders
to hold the train over the Saginaw
branch at the station and get the
wrecking outfit under ste.im. It then
waited for the word it knew must coir.e.
There was no chance of the fast run
ning trains to see each other through
the driving blizzard in time to even
'siow down, and in Â» few minutes word
come from the conductor of No. 5 that
they had clashed together, and that
there was an awful loss of life.

NAPA. Dec. 27. â Eight carloads of
sixty-two-pound steel rails have ar
rived at the Napa depot. At first it
was suspected that they were for the
use of the new electric road between
Benicia, Vallejo and Napa. for which
eight carloads of ties have already ar
rived. It develops that the new rails
are for the Southern Pacific Company.
Considerable repairs will be made on
the Napa Valley branch of the rail

CHICO, Dec. 27.â The mysterious dis
appearance of a young man named
Leonard McNab, timekeeper on con
struction work of the Butte County
Railroad between Magalia and Love
lock, in this county, was reported here
to-day. McNab had been at work for
some days.
On the day before Christina's he went
on horseback to Magalia to cash a time
check and get his mall. Getting the
money, amounting to $30. and the mail,
he left for the camp. That night the
horse, riderless, appeared at the camp.
Search was immediately made for Mc-
Nab, but so -far with no success.
The locality is infested with thieves
and hold-up men and it Is feared that
he has been murdered for his money.
McNab recently came from Halifax, N.
9., where he has wealthy parents.

TACOMA, Dec. 27.â Because Santa
Claus* whiskers caught fire last night
the Christmas .entertainment of the
Union Sunday school at Oakville came
very near having a disastrous ending.
Edward O'Neill was chosen to imper
sonate Santa Claus. He wore long
white wool whiskers and his clothes
were covered with cotton to represent
snow. In some way the cotton became
ignited and instantly he was enveloped
in flames. He became frightened and
started -on a run for the door, to the cha
grin of the Sunday school children, who
thought that Santa Claus should be
proof against fire, inasmuch as he
spends most of his time going up and
down chimneys.
Several men near the door caught
O'Neill and pulled off the inflammable
material before he was badly burned.
Women were frightened, babies cried
and there was a small panic until the
fire was extinguished. A light dress
worn by one little girl caught fire, but
this was ouick&r extinguished.

CHICAGO. Dec. 27. â In reviewing
the year's work of the United Stateu
army in the Department of the Lakes,
Major General John C. Bates, com
mander-in-chief of this territorial
division, says that the character and
appearance of recruits is not up to the
standard as compared* with those of
former years, the number of unde
veloped youths being especially no
ticeable. According to the report the
"Baby Blue" facings for infantry is
unpopular and without exception is
opposed by all infantry officers and a
return to the white facings is univers
ally desired, as is also -the retention
of the officers* blue overcoats in lieu
of the new olive drab overcoat. The
general mess system In operation
throughout the department is declared
unsatisfactory and a return to com
pany mess system is recommended.

WEDDINGS.
their parents and teachers, look for
ward ' with hopeful anticipation* from
the first preliminary hint of the holi
days, and It has never failed- to Â¦ draw
a crowded house. The pupils themselves
make, up* a pretty big asemblage, and
when their fathers and mothers - and
sisters and brothers and other relatives
and well-wishers add their numerical
strength to the congregation there Is
sure ( to be a demand for even standing
room.
The jam in the spacious schoolroom
showed this yesterday afternoon, when
Archbishop Montgomery, assisted by a
number of priests and Sisters of Mercy,
began distributing the rewards Â¦ of
merit. On the platform with the Arch
bishop were Fathers Prendergast,
O'Ryan, Dempsey and Hannigan and
several Sisters of the Holy Family, un
der whose management the school- has
attained such a large popularity. Sur
rounding them* were the prizesâ great
stacks of books and pictures and boxes
of candy â and facing them sat Â¦ the
teachers and pupils. . No effortjwas
made to preserve the Sunday-school at
mosphere or. to restrict the eager spirits
of the youngsters so long as> they did
not approach actual disorder.
DISTRIBUTING THE PRIZES.
The proceedings were opened with
a hymn, and then. the Archbishop and"
his aids took their respective positions
amid the wealth of gifts and began the
distribution. Superintendent A. D.
Kenniff was summoned to the , front
and given a picture so big that he
could hardly carry it away, and then
Chief Usher Gomez was made Jhe re
cipient of a chair so heavy 'that lie did
not attempt Its removal. Each of the
presentations was lustily applauded by
the children. Then the teachers .were
called up, one by ; one, and given a
handsome book, a box of candy and a
kindly 6mlle by the Archbishop, and
as each lady accepted the gift she was
tenedered a shrill ovation by her pupils.
After that the boys who had won prizes
â two of which were awarded to. each
classâ went up to the platform empty
handed and walked away from it bear-
Ing each a picture or a book and a box
of candy. The girl pupils were simi
larly treated, the very little ones re
ceiving dolls instead of books, and then
every child in the chamber was given
a remembrance of some kind and the
Inevitable box of candy. *
The ceremony consumed about two
hours, and the Artfibishop, the priests
and the sisters seemed to enjoy It every
whit as much as did the children.

The bell has been located and the

cover It. Another, dated 1812, has been
traced to an abandoned schoolhouse at
Watsonville. Is American sentiment
still a living thing?
Another relic has been locatedâ one
that should Interest every lover of
Californiaâ the baptismal font of
Father Junlpero (Serra) of sainted
memory. It stood for over half a cen
tury in a stone recess at Carmel, but
one day there wandered Into the sanc
tuary a sightseer in the person of the
then Secretary" of State. Without any
hesitation but that caused by the re
sistance of the cement, he wrenched
the font loose and caused it to be
carted off. It finally degenerated into
a flowerpot In the long-reaching Secre
tary's back yard and is now In Santa

The huge, double-lidded copper bap

has made some interesting discoveries
In the line of the prehensile proclivities
of the species of man known as the
"vandal."'
The league has Just completed re
building the five foot thick walls of the
beautiful olfi Mission of San Antonio de
Padua, in Monterey County, and had,
before Interfered with by the, rain, re
built the roof, thirty feet of which is
completed, while the rest had to be pro
tected by sheathing until spring.
That done, the league has been cast
ing about for the furnishings of the
sanctuary that is older by four years
than our nation, but that is the lesser
of the claims it has upon our loves.
The doors, big, hand carved affairs of
cedar, had been carted off by an emi
nently respectable woman to adorn her
home in this city. And so they wouldn't
be lonely in exile, she tore off several
rings from the altar rail, while a less
strenuous companion bore oft a bell â a
blessed old copper bell that long had
swung from an oak tree, calling' the In
dians to matin hymns and to vespers.

It was the morning after Christmas.
The children of a prominent merchant
who resides in the Western Addition
were sitting about the large open fire
place around which the night before,
hopeful and expectant, they had hung
their'stockings. The stockings were now
on the floor, while strewed all about
the room was ample evidence that
Santa Claus had not overlooked the
little ones.
The youngest one of the four children,
a little girl, barely twp years of age, sat
a little apart from her brothers and
sisters. Her lap was full of toys and
the pretty little things that^go far to
make glad the heart of a child. But
she did not seem to be as joyful as the
others. Her little brow was puckered
and she seemed to be in deep thought.
Finally her father noticed her lack of
cheerfulness and picked her up in his
arms. "What's the matter with my
little pet?" he asked her. "Aren't you
satisfied with what Santy brought
you?"
"Yes. papa," the little one replied. "I
was jest wondering why we don't wear
stockin' on our handses."

It is a significant indication of thÂ«
present condition of hard times in the
theatrical world that in New York
alone 3,000 actors are without employ
ment, and that SOO companies have Â«iia
banded for the season. An Interesting
article by W. W. Harrison on this un
usual situation is published in the cur
rent Harper's Week*ly. It seems that
art and rubbish have suffered together;
neither Shakespeare, with one of our
most popular actors in the cast, nor
the kind of farces and musical come
dies which have usually appealed to the
publio, have met with success. It is
said that the receipts for one night's \ >
performance of "A Midsummer Night's^
Dream"," with Nat Goodwin as Bottom,
ran as low as $7.00. "The fact is," con
cludes Mr. Harrison, "that people are
not in a theater mood, and that the
plays which are called triumphs this
year are playing to only small houses.
Nowadays to pay expenses is a matta*
of congratulation."

Taken as a whole the" official statements with the ac
companying statistics make a striking showing of the
rapidly increasing wealth of the district. It is now cer
tain that it is to be something more than a mining and

porting a large population, and experience has shown
that the climate is by no means too severe for' the estab
lishment there of a high degree of comfort accompanied
by all the accessories of modern civilization.
ernor's 'annual report."
GOVERNOR BRADY'S report on the affairs of
Alaska consists almost wholly of a vigorous de
mand upon the Government for a b.etter treat
ment of the district in every department of govern
mental; work from transportation to the erection of the
district into a self-governing State without compelling if
to pass through a probationary condition as a Territory.
The report is, in fact, a good boom document for the
district, while at the same time it conforms strictly
enough to the common form of official reports.
All along the line Governor Brady sees our Govern
ment neglecting in Alaska interests which the Canadians
are promptly and liberally fostering in their Yukon ter
ritory. The difference between the two Governments is
strikingly shown in the matter of providing transporta
tion, for while the Canadians are undertaking vast works
to open up the Yukon and connect it with the ocean,
very little has been done to provide transportation in
Alaska. Fortunately private enterprise on the American
side is doing much to provide railways in some portion
of the district, for were it otherwise we would hardly
be able to make any showing at all to o."set the big en
terprises which' Canada has under way to bring the
whole Yukon into close relation with the rest of the
Dominion.
Another notable point of difference between American
neglect and Canadian care is pointed out by. the Gov
ernor in reviewing the outlook for mining. He says:
"If a stranger comes into the country seeking informa
tion he cannot be directed to any Government office
where he can obtain accurate and reliable information
on the mining enterprises in this district, but if he should
stop at Victoria, British Columbia, and make the same
kind of inquiry, he would be directed to the office of the
Minister of Mines, where he could learn every important
fact concerning any kind of mining in any district of the
Province."
The Governor himself does not undertake to give, a
complete review of the mining industry of the district,
but contents himself with saying: "From the length and
breadth of the land, from Ketchican through to Cold
foot, beyond the Arctic circle and down to Nome, come
encouraging reports. Capital is coming in from various
States and we hear of a Georgia, Minnesota, Indiana,
Tennessee. Pennsylvania and Ohio company. It is not
possible any longer to give an adequate and true de
scription of development of this industry in the Gov-

With a warning "Bhsh" he walked
over to the corner of the operating
room at the Central Emergency Hos

a moment, and then with head thrown
backward and arms stretched above
his head, he leaped into the air. He
came down on all fours, rose to his
feet, and then with arms raised
again and his head bent backward to
an amazing degree, he ran to the other
corner of the room and again jumped
ceiling-ward. Again he fell, and then
once more, in -a different corner he re
peated the jump.

he regained his feet, "to keep these tur

A lingering suspicion has found late expression in
the wise men who direct the destinies of China that if
Russia and Japan go to war .the Flowery Kingdom will

known for a long time. To a man doomed to death a
reprieve should be some consolation.
The canal connecting the Bay of
Cronstadt with St. Petersburg is a
work of great strategic and commercing
importance to Russia. The canal and

channel about ten miles, and they to
gether extend from Cronstadt, on tho

The next of the great 3hip canals con

Corinth with the Gulf of Aegina. Tho
canal reduces the distance from Adri
atic ports about 175 miles, and from
Mediterranean ports about 100 mil<-3.
Its length is about four miles. â Har

The Suez Canal is usually considered
the most important example of ship

A thousand other things bring on
quarrels, and sometimes they just seem
to come on of tnemselves.
It would be sublime if people never
did quarrel; but they doâ and therefore
it is a matter of the gravest importance
that they should know how to "make
up" afterward. No quarrel is ever
rightly "made up" without downright
confession and whole-hearted forgive
ness. They are "patched up," but not
"made up." The wound is hidden, but
not healed â unless the offender gets
down on his marrow bones, and the of
fended one bestows a gracious pardon.
It is psychologically impossible for it to
be otherwise. You might as well try to
heal a sword gash without bringing the
edges together: or solder lead pipes
without rosin. God has ordained and
decreed it to be as it is, and quarrels
that are not settled by confession and
pardon ieave the barb of the arrow,
even if the Â«Â»haft is drawn. This fact
is Rot understood or else U is ignored,
and the result is bitternes?, agony and
oftentimes divorce.
The confession of a wrong is a neces
sity, both to the soul that perpetrates
it and to the one which is its victim.
You may wish it was not so. People
wish they could escape toothache with
out filling or extraction, but nature has
billed it otherwise. No wrongdoer ever
feels a true self-respect without con
fession. He realizes that he ought to
admit his error and that nothing but
obstinacy restrains him. It is ignomin
ious and cowardly not to do it. and he is
ashamed of himself. This mortification
must be repressed in order to his men
tal rest, and so he puts on a bold front
and bluffs it down, an act which stimu
lates his egotism and hardens his heart.
He becomes proud, cold and brutaL All
his finer feelings die.
Confession is also a necessity for the
injured one. We are so made that in
jury hurts. The soul suffers as the
body does. Pain is the fundamental
element in self-preservation: If it did
rot hurt to be insulted and wronged
r.e should become the passive victims
of injustice and wrong. It does hurt,
and this hurt has but a single healing
lotion. We dream of relief through
revenge, but it is only a dream. Re
venge embitters and hardens. There is
only one balm, and that is the ac
knowledgment of the wrong by the one
v.ho his inflicted the wound. Nothing
Is more myFierious and wonderful than
the curative power of confession. It
6oothes the pain and draws the poison
from the sere. It is water on fire and
oil on water.
But forgiveness is as imperative a ne
cessity as "confession." it is passing
ctrange. but Â¦ It is unequivocally true
that a cuarrd cannot be made up
without a free pardon. The heart that
hae been hurt can be relieved and
restored to its. original state of good
will only when that divine sentiment
has exeded. as gums exude from
v.ounded trees. The bitterness is
drained cut by the act of pardon. If
you refuse to forgive you will feel un
worthy and be unhappy. And as for
the one who has acknowledged the
feult. nothing is more certain than that
he will be exasperated by your not for
tUxfng him. It is humiliating enough to
confess, but it is maddening not to be
forgiven. And yet in *pite of this psy
chological law some people pride them
selves in being vindictive. "We forgive
but we never forget," they sayâ too
stupid to perceive the contradiction. To
forgive is to fc-rget. The soul that
freely pardons gradually) loses the
memory <or at least the painful mem
ory) of the wound.
, This /spiritual "confession and par
don" is the most beautiful phenomenon
In nature. It is the cure for all men
tal unhappiness. Hearts capable of
performing these two sublime acts will
lave forever. The. deepest and . sweet
est experiences of their lives will be
"making up" thvir quarrels. Just as
divided ol<:ctric currents reunite when
passing through two poles of a battery,
their love will mingle through confes
sion and pardon. And so when you and
John read this article by the fireside
open your hearts to each other. Con
fess the sin, forgive the wrcms and
Worry bring? <m quarrels. If John
has a note coming due, or has just re
ceived a bill which he had forgotten all
about, or has had a strike on in his
mill, he hardly know? the difference be
tween a kiÂ«s and a cuff. So don't
worry.
I have heard married folks affirm with
great solemnity. "We have never had a
quarrel." But. I always wonder if they
do not mean a 'fight." That is easy
rnough, of course; but a "quarrel!"
How in the world can two people with
any fore* of character and any Ftrong
convictions about life get along for a
quarter of a cntury or more without
some sort of clp.sh that produces es
trangement ar.d altercation? They
sorely mupt ha angels â or rabbits!
Fatigue brings on quarrels. So don't
set overtired unless you have to. The
whole world looks so dark to a woman
when she has washed and ironed and
bakcd.'all in the same day. Every bone
in h*>r body aches. There Is a numb
ness in the ba?e of her bra<n. Her head
throbs. The slightest noise goes

might be some feeling shown by these
caterers for the reason that none would
care to be classed second. But there
should be a way out of it, and ther*Â»
should be at the bottom of the bill oT

Certainly, there should bp some rem

But most men "Tfre gentlemen, if
treated as such. If a woman is uni
formly courteous to a man, he isâun
less under all his polish, of the stuff
of which beasts are made â usually cour
teous to her. This being true, she will
overlook his occasional lapses into ir
ritability, and meet them with the
silence that is golden. Not with a sulky
silence, but with the gentle quiet that
se-ems to throw a mantle of charity
over his ill humor and condone it be
cause it is such an unusual thing.
Then, when oportunity offers, in other
words, when her husband pauses in
his complaints, she will cheerfully talk
of something else and distract his at
tention from the point at issue.
But suppose he is at heart the beast
above suggested. Only one course re
mains. When wifely tact, love and
pleading, followed by judicious silence,
have availed naught, let the wife sys
tematically set about learning not to
care.
I see the. shudder of shocked dismay
with which the model matron meets
this suggestion. But I still maintain
my stand. When a wife has done her
duty toward her husbandâ failing in
nothing that can make him happy and
comfortableâ and he still treats her
brutally, complains continually, is per
versely unjust to her and eternally
nags at her. let her summon all her
tact to avoid occasions for "the enemy
to blaspheme," continue to do her duty
and then gather up what is left of her
life. There is something in life besides
a husband and a husband's approval.
First, and above all else with which
God blesses women, there are the chil
dren. Let our disappointed wife live for
them' and in them. Let her allow the
side of her heart wijh which she would
grieve over her husband's injustice be
so full of that which is worth all of life
that she cannot take time to brood over
her great sorrow. She still owes the
man her duty, her fidelity and, if she
be a good woman, she will pay what
she owes to the uttermost farthing, but
let her not cast her pearls of loveÂ»and
feeling before swine, or waste her
heart's blood upon that which proflteth
not. She may be one with her boys and
girls, she may read, study, enjoy her
friends, keep her sympathies fresh, re
joice with the j6yful, grieve with the
sorrowing.
Can she be happy? That depends
upon the woman. If she begone of the
women of w^om the Irishman spoke as
"three-halves mother'^ she will be al
most content. The part of her that
longs for husbandly symrathy, for the
ideal understanding that may and does
exist in some lives, will go to her grave
hungering. Many widows know the
same longing, the same heart-hunger.
To the sensitive soul their lot may seem
easier than hers; Ah, well, ; for both
there is a world that sets this right!
"Dear, you know that I love you, and
that I would bear anything that was
necessary for you. But there is one
unnecessary thing that I cannot prom
ise to bear, and that is rudeness. I
am not used to it. I married a gentle
man, not a boor. So, John, dear, you
must not speak to me again as you did
to-night, if I am to continue to love
you and respect you. You and I are
equals, husband and wife, not master
and slave. I know you did not mean
what you. said. But you cannot say
such things to me. I could not resent
it where our guests were. But it cut
me â and, dear, it disappointed me. I
am sure, knowing this, you will not
make that mistake again."
Being a gentleman, he never did.
Had he not been a gentleman at heart,
he might have answered brutally. In
which case, silence on the part of the
wife would have been the only wise
course. She should then have walked
until some more propitious time before
speaking again of the matter, or, had
the offense never been repeated, not
mentioned it again.
And as he, wondering at her gravity,
followed her suggestion, she continued:
The thoroughbred wife controlled
all evidence of agitation except her
rising color. Tactfully the
subject, she chatted pleasantly on until
the last guest had departed. Th#>n, as
her husband, forgetful of what had
happened, and quite his usual good
naturtd self again, turned to her with
a smiling remark, ehe said quietly:
"John, dear, there is a little matter
I want to talk to you about. Sit down,
please, here on the sofa, by me."
The savage, latent in every man,
sprang â as is frequently the case, with
out sufficient causeâ to the front.
"Mistaken! You are not only 'mis
taken, but you ari^talking like a fool!"
To attain this end she will discourage
at the outset any rough language. One
bride within a month of her marriage
showed with gentle dignity that she
would allow nothing but courteous
treatment from her liege lord. They
were entertaining a few friends in their
now home. The bride made a statement
which the husband contradicted. She
hesitated a minute, then said gently:
"John, I think that was the way that
happened. 1 may, however, be mis
taken."
The main noint is not what is asked
by the man, but how it is asked. We
have not so much to do with the matter
of the demand as with the manner of
it. Every dutiful wife has the right to
exact a courteous manner and gentle
manly speech from her husband.

What about the man who is master
ful and domineering? How is his wife
to treat him?
If she would not lose her own and
her husband's respect she will not
quarrel, will not scold, will. not nag. She
need not resort to means which are be
neath the dignity of a refined woman.
Let the wife appreciate that she is
her husband's equal, his friend, his
partner â not his slave nor his toy. She
must also have such love for him that
when an issue of no import arises. and
he asks in a kind, considerate *vay that
he have thinjrs as he wishes tiiem, she
will gladly yield to his desires. It is a
safe rule for married life that, except
in a matter of principle, if one must
yield it should be the wife. But let' her
do it through love, not through slavish
obedience, and let it be only in mat
i ters in which the man has a right to
! make demands.

"Newspaper men. It's reported that
Joaquin Miller is dead," was the reply.
"Dead!" came a husky exclamation,
quickly fallowed by a command: "Come
in."
It was from the shaggy Californian
himself. Wrapped in his bear robea
and. lying prone upon his cot, the poet
wa s seen by the flicker of a candle
flame. Joaquin almost shouted:
"Dead! Who said I was dead? I'm
not dead, and I want you to go back
as quickly as you came and pay so.
Good night."
That was all. But the bulletin had
been wired throughout the Eastern
State3 and it was too late that night to
correct it there. When the mails brought
many of the cross-mountain journals to
the coast the poet had the unusual ex
perience of reading some very enter
taining if not altogether accurate ac
counts of his passing across the great
divide.
"Who's there?"
"Joaquin Miller died to-night at Oak
land" was the brief but startlingly
newsy bulletin flashed into the San
Francisco newspaper offices one night
not long ago. There was a bustle and
rush from telegraph editors to the news
editors, thence to the city editors. The
city editors promptly called on their re
spective 'cross-bay correspondents.
Along about midnight a procession of
reporters headed for "The Heights" in
the Fruitvale foothills, where the verse
writer makes his domicile. The news
paper men v:ere out to verify the story,
which was a "big" one from the news
paper point of view. About 1:30 o'clock
a. m. the crowd arrived at Joaquin's
picturesque habitat. Knocks at the
door. No response. More knocks, and
then a gruff:
CONDITIONS in trade last week were rather
mixed, but on the whole satisfactory. It being
Christmas week there was naturally little doing
in wholesale lines, nor will there be until after the turn
of the year and perhaps well along toward the end of
January. Business is always quiet at this season.
With the turn of the year comparative statements from
the different lines will begin to come in and we will then
know definitely how 1903 stood as compared with 1902.
It is not expected to make the brilliant showing of 1902
â the banner year, whose record will probably stand for
some time to come. Commodity prices â¢ have shrunk
moreVr less this year and there has be.en a vast decline
in the stock market, which will cut down the aggregate
figures from those of 1902, but the situation now-is really
better than last year at this time, according to present
indication?. Then we were looking with apprehension
for the appearance of some kind of financial or mercan
tile storm, the consequences of which could not be fore
seen, but which would create more or less disturbance.
The storm came as expected, but fortunately was con
fined to a decline in the stock market, general trade be
ing little affected, and then only at the close of the year
and onlj' indirectly. Now that the storm has gone and
the inflated and abnormal conditions in Wall street have
been corrected we are on a sounder basis than at the
close of 1002. The annual figures when they come in
may show smaller totals in many lines, but the shrinkage
has not been serious and has been a benefit rather than a
detriment to trade. Hence we may look forward to a
good though perhaps quieter year in 1904. At any rate,
as far as present signs go, we will feel less uncertainty,
except from the shadow of the Presidential election,
which is now appearing on the horizon of trade. ,
Private reports from Wall street received at the close
of the week said that the January disbursements for
dividends, interest, etc., would fall about $2,000,000 below
those of the preceding 3'ear and that they would prob
ably not be over $134,000,000, whereas $145,000,000 had
been expected. This of course is surmise. The amount
will be large in any event and will tend to still further
ease an already easy money market. In fact the predic
tion is now being made that money will presently be a
glut. Whether this prediction will provd true or not,
the course of the money market since last summer has
been an agreeable surprise in all quarters. A serious
stringency had been feared during the crop moving
period, but it not only did not appear, but money was
actually easier than for some preceding years. We are
well supplied with funds everywhere, no particular tight
ness being reported from any quarter.
General trade conditions show little change. One en
couraging leature iast week was an improvement in col
lections, but against this it was noted that the suspen
sion of manufacturing plants for the annual stock "tak
ing, repairs, etc., was more pronounced than for. some
years. The failures for the week were 284, against 209
last year, while owing to the decrease in speculation the
bank clearings at New York were 16.7 per cent behind
those of 1902. The iron and steel industry reported a
better outlook all along the line, with the general opin
ion among the controlling interests in the trade that fur
ther reductions in quotations were no longer necessary,
especially as orders for the early part of 1904 were
showing an increase. From this it was inferred that the
lower prices had begun to stimulate trade.
The showing in cotton was sensational. Although the
high prices for the staple checking the demand and
the mills are buying no more than is positively neces
sary to fill current orders and are steadily decreasing
their output, and the Chinese and other export demands
have fallen off sharply, the volume of business in this
staple during the past two months has been enormous.
The price has advanced above all records for a quarter
of a century and option trading to the amount of a
million of bales per day has not* been unusual. -Again
in November, while our merchandise exports aggregated
$160,000,000, or $35,000,000 more than in November, 1902,
nearly the whole of this increase, or $32,000,000, was in
cotton and was due to high prices and the backwardness
of the crop. Conservatism now characterizes every de
partment of the cotton goods market.
As to the general export movement, while our No
vember exports were only twice exceeded, our imports
amounted to only $77,000,000, compared with $85,000,000
last year. This left an excess of exports this year of
$83,000,000, against less than $40,000,000 a year ago. So
favorable a trade balance easily explains the recent in
flux of gold and suggests its further continuance for a
period, the present tendency being for diminished im
ports regardless of the export movement, although the
latter promises good results for the current month.
The New England footwear factories are receiving
few new orders, but Eastern wool buyers have reap
peared in the market and are purchasing with more free
dom and the wool market is accordingly showing more
activity. The purchases by tanners have absorbed th*
moderate offerings of hides and the lower grades of
leather are reported firmer. Provisions remain about
as they were during the preceding week, with supplies
ample for all requirements and the market showing no
especial activity.
The far Western railroads are moving over 10 per
cent more tonnage than a year ago and the decline east
of the Mississippi is not over 5 per cent, so there is still
a net gain of about 6 per cent for December over 1902.
The reports sent to the mercantile agencies by the
different cities of the country continue cheerful and are
accompanied by confident expectations of another good
year- in trade. The reports from California, notably San.
Francisco, tell of excellent conditions in the wholesale
trade. The southern part of the State is sadly in need
of rain and if it does not get. a good wetting soon the
bean and cereal crops down there may. turn out short
next year. The State north of San Francisco has thus
far received plenty of moisture and reports farming op
erations proceeding as usual, with cheerful indications
everywhere.
To summarize, the condition of trade in the United
States at the close of 1903 is satisfactory > and there are
no sinister signs apparent anywhere. Prosperity is still
with the country and on a more stable, even if quieter,
basis than in 1902.

The product of the strictly temperate zones less at
tracted the attention of Junipero Serra and his followers.
It remained for the later comers to the land to attempt
the cultivation of the apple t on a large scale.
Now the Monterey New Era, after' an investigation
of the apple producing capacity of Santa Cruz- and
Monterey counties, announces that Carmel- Valley is
"the ideal place for the growth of apples." Of course,
there are localities that will challenge the claim of
the New Era that Carmel Valley is superior to . all
others, but at the same' time its excellence will be
generally acknowledged. Ideal spots are manifold.
The New Era describes Carmel Valley, where one of
the most picturesque of the early missions still stands,
and -says "that the entire valley will be planted to apples
at no distant date may be deemed certain and all who
engage in apple growing here may congratulate them
selves, for the lot of the apple grower is happier than
that of any other tiller of the soil. Trees .bear abun
dantly here and a tract of fifteen acres will afford a
good living for the average family and permit the sav
ing, of a good sum of money every year. Here the grow
ing of apples is yet in its infancy, and although great
quantities of this fruit are shipped annually to all parts
of the world, there is still unplanted a large area of land
suitable to apple culture. The section offering the prob
ably the greatest opportunity, for the growth of apple
production in California is the Carmel Valley."
There" 1 is no more picturesque spot along the coast
of California than the Carmel Valley. If the predic
tions of the New Era are fulfilled concerning its prolific
production of the apple the entire State will be glad.
The apple industry cannot be overdone in California
for many years to come, as the demand for the fruit is
enormous. . .

The Orpheum road show continues
to be popular this week without any
change of programrry?. The common
opinion is that it is the best that has
been on the Orpheum stage for many
a day and the packed houses bear this
statement oi*. Albertus and Millar,
with their spangled clubs; Elizabeth
Murray, tho Iri3h songstress; the Me
lani troubadours, and the muscular
Nightons are still the drawing cards
that they were a week ago.
* * *
It was a laugh from beginning to
end at the California last night. "Are
You a Mason?" was presented by a
first-class company and the show was
heartily enjoyed. Each of the charac
ters was sustained Hn a manner that
more than pleased the large audience.
The farce is a solid entanglement of
fraternal matters with domestic com
plications thrown in. The father of a
family attempts to allay the sus
picions of his wife caused by his ir
regular hours by announcing that he
is a Mason, and he meets several pros
pective son-in-laws who are practicing
the same deception. Three acts are "re
quired to straighten matters out, but
before the curtain drops felicity reigns
and every one is happy.
William Robert Daly, stock broker
and former actor, sustains a dual char
acter. Edward Kellie, who plays papa
in the show, makes a hit and introduces
much that is new in the comedy line.
Misses Adelaide Wise, Georgia Hart
and Mary Faber are exceedingly clever
in their roles, and Miss Jessie Church
makes an excellent mother-in-law.
Louis R. Grisel and Miss Valbourg
Hermann appear 'as a country couple,
and Thomas David is good in the char
acter of a lover caught in the meshes
of Masonry. Charles Kennedy does
Hamilton Travers, usher in a music
hall; Thomas V. Emory makes himself
a favorite as a young architect, and
Edward Marshall is on the bills as a
policeman. Miss Mamie Johnstone, as
cook to an aristocratic family, and Miss
Estelle Lewis, as Fanchon Armitage,
a cloak model, also add much to the
fun.
Brian Parley, a sterling actor, played
the part of the old minister with dignity
and pathos and the comedy lines were
well looked after by Harry B. Reid,
Charles L. George; R. Dinsmore, Will
J. Morton, Agnes Lane,and Louise Fos
ter.
The staging of the play Was very real
istic and the Grand Opera-house, man
agement is to be congratulated in se
curing such a splendid attraction as
"The Minister's Son" for the amuse
ment of its patrons.
The entire company appearing in
"The Minister's Son" is to be commend
ed for its mqst artistic work. There is
no straining after effect or desire to.
earn applause by stilted situations.
The actors and actresses are natural in
all the scenes and they hold their audi
tors with* keen interest through the en
tire play.
"W. P. Patton is certainly entitled to
star in the character of the son of the
persecuted minister. He* has a quiet
and quaint method that draws tears as
well as laughter and proves himself to
be a clever actor.
Kathryn as the wronged daugh
ter of the minister won all hearts by her
womanly portrayal of the role. There
was a true ring in her delivery of the
lines that showed she had fully grasped
the author's conception.
George Kenneth as the villain was re
warded with hisses by the audience,
which is the best compliment that can
be paid to an actor in such roles.
Two large audiences gathered at the
Grand Opera-house yesterday to enjoy
th* charming play, *;The Minister's'
Son," as presented by W. B. Patton and
his excellent company.
Not since the time that Sol Smith
Russell appeared in this city had the
theater-going public had an opportuni
ty of witnessing a play jn which pathos
and humor are so delightfully blended
as in "The Minister's Son."
While the play has nothing that is
new in the way of stagecraft, the man
ner of its portrayal is its chief merit.
It tells a story of villainy combated by
virtue and right and the character of
the son of the minister is most cleverly,
drawn and played.-
The quaint humor of Simon Ray
reaches the hearts of the audience and
one cannot but feel that his good quali
ties are not those of the stage, but of
real life.
In many other places of worship
Christmas musical services were held
yesterday morning and last night. The
choir at Trinity Church, under the di
rection of Louis H. Eaton, rendered
a programme which was in every essen
tial as beautiful as that given on
Christmas day. At St. Luke's Church
there was an evensong and at St. Paul's
Episcopal Church there was also a
grand musical service devoted to
Christmas carols.
At the First Congregational Church
there was a Christmas musical service
both in the morning and evening and
at the Third Congregational Church an
augmented choir rendered Gaul's ex
quisite cantata, "Prince of Peace." At
Grace Methodist Church there was also
a Christmas song 'â¢ stival, as was the
case at the Howard Presbyterian
Church, the First Persbyterian Church
and the First Unitarian Church. The
choir of the Cathedral Mission repeated
the Christmas day carols.
The Fourth Congregational Church
had an elaborate Christmas song festi
val in the evening ana at Simpson
Memorial Church there was a pro
gramme of Christmas music and song
at both the morning and evening ser
vices. At St. Mary's Cathedral the
music' was exceedingly fine and at St.
Dominic's Church the beautiful Christ
mas day musical programme was re
peated yesterday.
The churches were crowded at morn
ing and evening services. The decora
tions at all the churches were very
handsome. M-%$
The orchestra played the first, second
and third parts of tne cantata, "The
Night of Glory," and the service ter
minated with the congregation singing
the anthem, "My Country, 'Tis of
Thee.",
The Rev. Mr. Gibson delivered a
powerful sermon before the singing of
the anthem, his subject being "Peace,"
in which he asked all men to remember
that peace did not mean the ending of
battles or the withdrawal of soldiers
from the field of carnage, but what was
meant by the peace given by the savior.
The peace hn meant to be understood
and practiced was the individual peace,
peace for the person, for this land and
that land and every land. It was the
peace that makes peace. It was that
peace that rrust be fii the hearh of man
that he may understand his duty of
peace to the world. Christ, said the
Rev. Mr. Gibson, came that night and
asked for peace â it was a message from
God between himself and those he had
made.
The orchestra was composed of the

PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 27.â H. K.
Pancoast, skiographer of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, has discovered
that it is possible by means of the
X-ray to bo bleach the skin of a negro
that, to all intents and purposes, the
subject becomes a white person. The
condition of a person so treated is ap
parently permanent.
This discovery was made incidentally
while Â¦ negroes were being treated in
the university for cancer and lupus,
and while r.o attempt has been made
so far to experiment with the skin of
a healthy negro, Dr. Pancoast says it
is possible to change the color.
The skin of a negro who has been
under the X-ray is quite like that of
the ordinary white man and presents
a perfectly healthy appearance. The
skin is natural, despite the fact that
the rays have destroyed the pigment
which caused the coloring.

Philadelphia Scientist Says
He Can Alter the Human
Skin From Black to White
He went on the road in thd morning
and lounged about during the after
noon, keeping as much as possible out
of -(he public eye. He gavs out his
weight as 13O',i pounds. He. expects to
retire to-night at weight and counts
on being a pound lighter on Tuesday
morning. This is all the leeway he
wants in order to make the required
weight at 6 o'clock Tuesday evening.
Corbett has changed his point of view
of life noticeably since his last visit
here. Cupid, the god of love, is said
to have taken a hand in shaping his
future career. He has set his heart
on winning this fight and, possibly, one
other on this coast. He expects New
York to be open to the boxers next
winter and sees a golden harvest to be
garnered there if he can retain his
premier position among the little men.
Five miles on the road in the morn
ing and two hours of light work in his
gymnasium in the afternoon was the
extent of Eddie Hanlon's training at
his camp in Alameda. He took his
early spin in company with Harry
Foley, who has watched the little fel
low's training: with an eagle eye for
the last five weeks. In the afternoon
Eddie was visited, by. 500' persons from
this side of the bay. He punched the
bag, skipped the rope and knocked cut
imaginary Young Corbetts for their
entertainment, and was then given his
usual rubdown. Hanlon will do noth
ing in the training line to-day outside
of, light roadwork. To-morrow he will
again take to the highways for a
breathing spin, and after returning will
rest up until it is time to start for this
city. ... . . .
The opinion of betting men is that
Corbett will be a six to ten choice to
night when \ragering ceases. They base
this opinion on the ease with which *he
has made the stipulated weight, thus
guaranteeing that he is in condition for,
a hard fight. Then there is the con
stantly^ recurring question of "class."
This is defined as a quality which gives
to the man, horse or dog possessing it
the ability to do a little better than
an opponent at" a critical stage of any
contest. Since he won the champion
ship Corbelt has shown this "class" in
a marked degree. â¢ It mattered no^ how
Champion Corbett and Eddie Hanlon,
challenger for the coveted title, were
the center of admiring throngs yes
terday at their respective training
quarters. Hanlon, with his epacious
gymnasium, was able to give his
friends a view of him in action. Cor
bett was unable to do this, as he was
afraid his visitors might wreck his
quarters.
The dogs which ran into 'the big
money were required to show great
stamina, as all the trials Were severe
and furnished exciting sport. The at
tendance wa3 large and the betting
spirited throughout the day. The

ALAMEDA. Dec. 27.â Xot once did
the Occidentals have a chance to
store a goal in their game with the
crack Thistles in the association foot
ball game played this afternoon on the
Webster-street field. The losers
were outclassed and at times their
opponents toyed with them. When
the referee sounded his whistle for
the close of the second half the Occi
dentals were the possssors of a goose
egg and the Thistles were five to the
good. Two of the victors* goals were
kicked in the first half and three in
the second half. The clever passing
and team work of the winners was
the best witnessed on the srounds this
season. So systematically and scien
tifically was it done that the Occi
dentals wore often puzzled and be
wildered at their, opponents' tactics.
At no stag-e of the play was it neces
sary for the Thistles to extend them
selves and they kept the pigskin
sphere constantly in the Occidentals'
territory. It was the first appearance
of the Thistles on the Webster-street
field and their brilliant work highly
pleased the large crowd that watched
the contest. The elevens lined up
as follows:

Although Mr. Carolan scored no goals,
his play was unusually fine and he add
ed must strength to his side. It was
evident neither Driscoll nor Dunphy
was in his best form, for the odds were
in favor of their side w inning.
The game was umpired by Mr. Ezra,
a noted player from India, who en
forced the latest English rules, the first
time they have been used here. The
sides were as follows:
Whitesâ F. J. Carolan, R. M. Tobin,
C. Raoul-Duval. J. Lawson.
Redsâ Charles Dunphy, T. A. Driscoll,
E. W. Howard. Lawrence McCreery.
If enough ponies are available three
teams will be entered for the big New
Year's event to come off next Friday.
That the Whites' score was not larger
was due chiefly to E. W. Howard, who
Etopped the ball frequently just at their
goal. Tobin and Lawson made two
EToais each for the Whites, while the
two for the Reds were made by Law
rence McCreeryJ
The holiday po!o match on the private
Held of Francis J. Carolan, master of
Crossways, yesterday, was marked by
unusual severity of play and by d. stub
born contest for supremacy. There
were six periods of ten minutes each
scheduled, but by an oversight of the
timekeeper most of them were consid
erably longer. This made hard work
for both players and ponies.
The score was four goals to two in
favor of the Whites.

Francisco defeated the Vampires of
Alameda two goals to none yesterday
on the Presidio Athletic Grounds.
The ball was kicked off at 2:35 p. m..
the Vampires defending the north and
the Independents the south goal. The
Vampires had the wind in their favor.
but the sun was in their faces. From
the start the Vampires played a fast
game and ke?t the ball in their op
ponents' territory most of the time.
Three fine shots were pent straight for
the middle of the goal, but Forbes kept
them all out. After fifteen minutes'
play the Independents rushed the ball
down the field and scored a goal from a
scrimmage.
In the second period the Independ
ents had the best of the play, getting
several corner kicks and keeping the
Vampires' goal constantly In danger.
About the middle of the period one of
the Fay brothers made a shot at goal.
Airth touching the ball with his fingers
but being unable to save. Neither std^
scored again and thf* match ended
thus: Independents. - goals: Vampire?,

work in the back line, Nolan on the
halfback line and Mechels and the Fay
brothers in the forward line. For thÂ»
losers Pcterscn. Harwood. Langdale
and Wilding were most conspicuous.

CINCINNATI. Dec. 27.â The packet
steamboat W. H. Graham was sunk at
the public landing here to-day by an
ice gorge, being the second boat sunk
here by ice within a week. With mov
ing ice ten feet thick, other craft and
wharf boats are in danger. The loss
of the Graham, including cargo, la
about $10,000.
The rise in the river in connection
with heavy ice from the gorges caused
more than $100,000 of other damage In
this harbor to-day. The largest loser
was the Cincinnati Gas Company.
Twenty-five of its barges loaded with
coal were broken from moorings, eight
of which were caught and seventeen
lost. Seven barges at the new city
water works were also carried away,
but afterward caught.
Thft Idler, a pleasure excursion
steamer owned by a club, was ground
to pieces by the ice here to-night, after
having broken from her moorings. Loss
$5000.
As the ice i3 passing out nearly all
the coal fleets have lost barges. Still
greater damages are expected in the
lower Ohio. The greatest gorge in the
Ohio is at North Bend. It la many
miles long and when it breaks the
craft in the lower Ohio will be in dan
ger.
PITTSBURG. Dec. 27.â The recent
cold snap has made dangerous the ice
in the Alleghany River. At Rosston
the gorge is an immense affair, being;
packed to the bottom and extending
fifteen miles up stream. It was formed
during a thaw; and the ice breaking
into small. pieces has packed all the
way to the bottom, offering resistance
that can scarcely be overcome. The
water is now backing up and spread
ing over the lowlands.
The gorge at Springdale still holds
and but little ice is floating in either
the Alleghany or Monongahela rivers.
The event of the day at Shell Mound
Park ranges yesterday was the final
shJot for the year of the Golden Gate
Rifle and Pistol Club.
/ s the maker of the best bullseye
would be declared king of the club for
the ensuing year, chief Interest centered
in this competition. The honor fell to
Otto Bremer with almost a center shot.
Frank E. Maeon led all competitors In
the expert rifle class with the fine score
of 2240 rings in his best ten-shot scores
for the year. He was closely followed
by Al Gehret with 2209. In the expert
pistol class J. E. Gorman was far la
the lead with 911 rings, his nearest fol
lower, being J. Kullman with 876.
In the- re-entry match among the ex
pert riflemen Al Gehret stands high
with 2273 rings, D. B. Faktor 2253 and
CM. Henderson 2245 for their best ten
strings.
In the monthly re-entry match D. B.
Faktor did great work with the rifle,
making 22?, 228 and 223 in his three ten
shot scores, being the best three con
secutive strings made during the year.
The club terminated the yearly con
test by giving a banquet in the large
hall of Shell Mound Park. M. J. White
acted as toastmaster and distributed
the prizes to the fortunate winners. W.
F. ' Blasse Â¦ was presented with a silver

The handicap doubles tennis tourna
ment commenced on Christmas day at
the California Club courts was com
pleted yesterday down to the finals.
The matches were all so long and so
hard fought that the players reaching
the finals were unable to continue. The
successful teams were Herbert Schmidt
and Harry Rolfe and Will Allen and
Dr. H. P. Hill.
The matches of . yesterday were the
closest and most interesting seen in
the club courts in months. The last
match of the day was by far the best.
All three sets went to deuce-vantage.
The contestants were Allen and Hill
and Ray Solivalo and Ray Cornell. The
latter received a handicap of "owe 5-6."
"With the same odds they had previous-'
ly beaten Will' Collier and C. J. Smith,
and were expected to win.' The handi
cap men after having a lead of 5â2,
which they lost, finally pulled out the
set, S â 6. In the second set they again
led at 5â2, and in the eighth game the
score stood owe 15 and 30 â 0 in their
favor. Allen and Hill by clever playing
soon ran the score up' to 5 â 5. At 6-^3
and 40-30 the match looked over, when
Cornell, through overanxlety, smashed
a short lob into the fence. Allen and
Hill won this set, 8â 6. In the third set
the scratch men led at 5â2. The handi
cap men, to the surprise of the specta
tors,, evened up the score at 5â 5 and led
at 6â5. Allen and Hill again ran out
the set, 8â6. Splivalo was tired in this
match and his partner was forced to
cover most of the territory on his side
of' the net. Both men played better
than ever before, but Splivalo hugged
the net too closely.
Another good match was that â¢ be
tween Harry nolfe and Herbert Schmidt
and Sidney Salisbury and Frank String^
ham. The former received the trifling
odds of '"owe 1-6." Like the foregoing
match, this one was full of long rallies
and the-outcome was in doubt until the
end. Splivalo and Cornell had a hard
time beating Smith and "Collier in the
first rotund. Collier played i-ather a
weak net game, and got short lobs
back instead of killing them/ Splivalo
and Cornell played a fine defensive
game, their lobbing being excellent.
Allen and Hill allowed Dan Volk
mann and Herbert Gray an extremely*
large handicap and just managed to
win out, the last two sets being close.
The final match will be played Sat
urday afternoon and should be a good
one. Schmidt and Rolfe -will receive
odds of "owe 3-6." They reached the

The address of the retiring president,
T. C. Hocking, set forth that to the
board belongs the credit of the cele
bration that will be held in April. A
part of Mr. Hocking's address is as fol
lows:
"The value of organization has been

not as effective or expeditious as other
internal parasites, still, it i3 a valuable
enemy o? this scale. We sent out coio
nfes of this parasite during the end of
May and early in June.
KILLS THE KATYDID.
Twenty years ago the large green
katydid did much damage to the blos
som twigs of orange trees in the south
ern counties. It is very rare now,
owing to a very interesting parasite
that attacks its eggs. The katydids
are large and voracious feeders and
would be destructive pests were it not
for the work of our friendly Eupelmus.
What has been accomplished by the
South African parasite of the "black
scale," Scutellista cyanea, will be inter
esting. This parasite was introduced
through the kindness of Professor
Charles P. Lounsbury. Government En
tomologist of Cape Colony, two years
ago. Several colonies were sent by Pro
fessor Lounsbury to E. M. Ehrhorn,
Horticultural Commissioner and Ento
mologist of Santa Clara County. He
bred a colony In confinement, but
did not succeed in establlshlns them,
out of doors.
On October 1, 1901. Professor Louns
bury wrote me that he would send me
on the following day two boxes con
taining parasites. The packages toek
thirty <Â»avs to reach us and we bred
seventeen ScutelHsta cyanea. and a ftrat
secondary parasites. The latter we de
stroyed. Only four of the true para
sites were females and unfortunately
one of those was killed by a small
spider, leaving but three with which to>
stock the State. On February 17, 1002.
the Scute'Usta began to i*sue from th?
scales and the descendants of thoso
three have increased to millions and
wonderful work has been accomplished
by them in this short time.
During July I made an extended tour
of the southern counties and reported
my observations of the work of the
Scut<Â»I.'isla to State Cornni'33'.or.or â¢Â¦Â£
Horticulture Cooper. Since then ve
have had most encouraging reports
from County Horticultural Commis
sioners, orchardists and others, show

that will be of incalculable value to ths
fruit growers of California.
Dangerous Scales Meet
Their Deadly
Enemies.
Friendly Insects Are
Found to Do the
Work.
No member of the late Board of
Horticulture, or the Commissioner of
Horticulture, or any one â¢ connected
with his department, has ever advo
cated the "let alone policy" with re
spect to the control of injurious in
sects for which we have no parasite
or predaceous insect enemy. It was
only after very heavy loss \ and ex
pensive experience that we determined
to try nature's method and introduce
the insects that keep such. pests under
control in their native country. -
The pioneer orchards of California,
those planted before 1849, were mostly
When Californlans first suggested
the idea of controlling the injurious in
sect pests of our orchards by the aid
of beneficial or friendly insects, some
of the prominent entomologists of the
country ridiculed the proposition, and
one even advanced the statement that
few pests meant few parasites. Cer
tainly if there were only few injuri
ous insects, they could hardly be con
sidered pests, and few parasites would
be required to keep them in subjection.
It is now a well recognized fact that
injurious insects are those that have
no parasites to keep in check their ex
cessive increase.
Insects that live at the expense of
growing plants, trees or shrubs, must
be considered injurious and the greater
their numbers the . more destructive
will their presence be to the trees at
tacked. Some injurious insects are
more or less restricted in their food
habits or tastes, and again others at
tack a great variety of plant life and,
on this account, are difficult to control
by artificial methods, such as poisons,
sprays or fumigators.
Artificial methods have in no in
stance exterminated or even prevented
the spread of insect pests when once
established in a district. Their too
rapid increase and spread have been
checked to greater or less extent by
such remedies, and it would be the
height of. folly to await the advent or
introduction of a parasite or beneficial
insect to destroy the pest, when it can
be destroyed in great numbers by
either spraying or fumigation. Exter
mination Is out of the question with
either method, and the work has to
be repeated at least once a year and,
in the case of certain insects, from two
to six sprayings are necessary in
order to save the crop (as with apples
and pears) from destruction by the
codling moth. '^ ,
METHODS OF XATURE.
BY ALEXANDER CRAW.
grown from seedling trees or propa
gated from locally grown trees and
were free from pests. The orange and
lemon trees were bright and free from
smut. The bright and thrifty condition
of the trees Induced our pioneers of
the fifties and sixties to bring or send
for new varieties. . The soft brown
scale was introduced into \he orchards
and gardens of Los Angeles and spread
with alarming rapidity. Orange trees
were killed by that scale and orange
planting was stopped. .Tears passed
and the parasites of this scale were un
intentionally introduced upon other
plants and now this scale is not classed
as a pest unless where the constant
presence of ants prevent the parasites
from accomplishing their destruction.
The parasites of the soft brown are
both chalcid files.
One is parasitic of the small scales
and the other attacks the full grown
scale. One deposits but one egg in each
scale and the other from one to eight,
and each egg develops into a maggot
and then into a perfect fly all under the
scale. They are exceedingly small in
sects, each with four wings, six legs
and two antennae. The orange growers
overlooked such diminutive insects and
their valuable work was ascribed to
some mysterious disease, or, as several
growers stated, "the scales had run
their course and were naturally dying
out."
BLACK SCALE KILLER.
[ The next serious scale that was in
troduced was the "black scale." This
is a more general feeder, and besides I
olive trees it also attacks orange, lemon,
lime, plum, peach, apricot, pepper, ole
ander, crataegus, pittisporum, abutllon,
pelargonium, photinias and a variety of
wild shrubs and weeds. We have a
native internal parasite that in some
seasons destroys from twenty-five to
seventy-five per cent, but as each scale
produces from 1500 to 2500 eggs, it will
be readily seen that the parasite alone
could not cope with such a pest, as It
has but one generation each year.
The black ladybird was introduced
from Australia by -Albert Koebele when
collecting beneficial insects for the
State Board of Horticulture of Califor
nia. Twenty of these valuable beetles
â¢reached us alive, and they have been
of great service in cleaning out the
black scale in the coast regions.
In the southwestern portion of Ala
meda County William Barry, Horticul
tural Commissioner of that portion of
the county, made a canvass in Wash
ington Township of the orchardists
having five acres and njore and learned
that since the Introduction of this bene
ficial Insect nine years ago they have
saved over 5171,000 in disinfection. The
"black ladybird" breeds the year round
and destroys the eggs, larvae and adult
"black scale." Unfortunately they do
not appear to thrive away from the sea
breeze. At Ellwood, in Santa Barbara
County, Mr. Cooper before the intro
duction of this ladybird spent from
$3000 to 55000 per annum in spraying his
orchards with kerosene emulsion. Since
then he has relied upon the ladybirds
and his trees bear better and cleaner
olives.
THE COTTONY CUSHION.
The next serious pest introduced was
the "cottony cushion scale." This came
on trees brought Into Menlo Park from
Australia in 1863 and in the eighties it
had spread over a great portion of the
State and it was such a destructive in
sect that the orange industry was
threatened.
Two years after it attacked the Shorb
groves at San Gabriel. It reduced the
crop from fifty carloads per annum to
six cars of inferior oranges on that es
tate'alone. .The expensive fight made
against j this pest in California with
sprays, fumigators, etc., resulted. In
more advance in the study of economic
entomology .than any other one thing
and was the cause of our belief that na
ture had a more efficient and cheaper
used. On alfalfa feed cows well-con
ditioned should give 200 to 350 pounds
of butter annually, but where native
feed only is had the return per cow
ranges from 125 to 150 pounds.
The matter of increase In calves is
important. Dairies are renewed from
the young stock. The dairyman has
his hogs, which are fed and raised on
the skim milk. These sources bring
considerable additional revenue. Cows
properly cared for will yield a return
of $5 to $7 per month each, or $60 to
$S5 annually.
HELPS THE FARMER.
The San Joaquin Ice Company at
Fresno a few years ago secured a herd
of high-bred cows, Holsteins and Jer
seys, and inaugurated the policy of sup
plying them on lease contracts. Any
farmer owning his farm or who has
made sufficient payment on a purchase
of land or invested enough in improve
ments to class him as a permanent set
tler can on application to the company
secure as many cows as he can prop
erly care for, be it five or fifty. The
purchase price is stated in the lease.
The farmer has full possession and
control, with the increase. He con
tracts to care for the stock well, to de
liver all the eream or butter fat â except
what is necessary for home require
mentâto the creamery and to permit
one-half the monthly returns to be ap
plied as part payment on the contract.
From actual experience it is shown that
the majority of cows put out on lease
are fully paid for in two years. The
farmer has his monthly income,
amounting to one-half the yield from
the cows, all the increase and the hogs
he has been able to support meantime.
With ordinary care cows are profita
ble for dairy purposes until they are
from ten to twelve years old, and can
then be fattened and sold for beef.
This industry affords wide opportu
nity for men of moderate as well as
men of large means. The dairyman
who delivers the product of five cows
to the creamery stands on exactly the
same footing as to price. and other con
ditions as one who has fifty or one
hundred cows. In this business there is
no partiality or preference. The farm
er has success in his own hands, and
the measure of that success is his in
dustry, economy and business capacity.
remedy where the scale was a native
than our artificial appliances.
\ Once started in this direction, our or
chardists held meetings, in Los Angeles
especially, and discussed ways and
means to have an expert sent to Aus
tralia to make a search for the parasite
that prevented the great Increase of
that scale in Australia and introduce it
into California.
Frank McCoppin of San Francisco
was appointed United States Commis
sioner to the World's Fair in Melbourne
in 1888 and generously put aside 52000 of
the funds allowed him for his expenses
to defray the cost of an expert ento
mologist to be attached to his retinue.
Albert Koebele was selected and he dis
covered and sent us the Vedalia cardl
nalis, a lady-bird that was hardly
known by the entomologists of its na
tive country.
Since then the State Board of Horti
culture has taken the precaution to
keep a stock of this valuable lady-bird
under propagation in confinement in the
San Francisco office. In this way we
can generally furnish colonies promptly
upon application of our orchardists.
Colonies have also been sent to Cape
Colony, South Africa; Egypt, Portugal,
Mexico, Hawaiian Islands; Society Isl
ands and to Florida.
When sending colonies of Vedalia
within the State we request the appli
cants to send us a box of scale Infested
twigs at our expense. In this way we
secure food for our colonies In our
breeding jars. Besides the Vedalia we
have three Australian lady-birds that
prey upon this scale alone. We have
also two internal parasite flies. With
such a list of active workers you can
readily understand that the "cottony
cushion scale" has a hard struggle for
existence in California.
OTHER VICTORIES WON.
Another foreign pest that has done
serious injury to orange and lemon
groves is the "yellow scale." L. J. Rose
of San Gabriel purchased a small Jap
anese orange tree and planted it on
his Sunny Slope estate. The existence
of scale was overlooked, at the time.
The scale spread to other orange trees
in the vicinity, and soon after the cele
brated avenue of four rows of grand
old trees appeared to be hopelessly
ruined.
Mr. Rose ordered the trees cut back
to the trunks and the latter scrubbed
with soap solution, but even such he
roic measures failed to check the
spread of the pest, for as soon as the
trees again sprouted the leaves were
found to be again infested. This was
in the early seventies.
The effect of this scale was to cause
the leaves to turn yellow and droop and
thus injure the health and productive
ness of the trees. In 1889 I called the
attention of the orchardists to the ex
istence of an almost microscopic inter
nal parasitic fly that was reducing ttw
numbers of the yellow scale at Sierra
Madra, and advised that no spraying or
fumigation should be done in that
neighborhood. Colonies of the parasite
were sent to other infected districts
and now the yellow scale Is rare- in the
seven southern counties. The horticul
tural commissioners of Los Angele3,
San Bernardino and even* Riverside al

most efficient. This parasite, llke^ the
scale,' is a native of Japan.
A hard fought battle was waged
against the so-called San Jose scale.
Although It has a local name, it is
nevertheless of foreign origin, and, ac
cording to Professor C. L. Marlatt, it is
a native, of China. The late James
Lick was a great lover of and experi
menter with trees and plants from
other countries, and it is claimed this
scale was first observed in his or
chard. The San Jose scale 13 not plai
tiful now in California, owing to an in
ternal parasite, Aphellnus fuscipennis,
assisted by the "twice stabbed lady
bird," Chlloccru8 blvulnerus and Rhlzo
bius toowoombae. Professor W. G.
Johnson records having "bred 1478 In-,
ternal parasite, Aphelinus fuscipennis,
in Maryland from a peach shoot four
inches long, that was seriously Infested
with San Jose scale. As each parasita
destroys the scale it' attacks before the
scale reproduces, it' cannot long remain
in injurious numbers.
The brown apricot scale'was a very
filthy pest on prune, apricot, peach ar.d
plum trees, owing to the great amount
of honey dew exuded by the insect-3.
The leaves and fruit were consequently
badly attacked by black smut. Since
its parasite became established in In
fested orchards it Is not so troublesome.
It takes two years to thoroughly stock
an orchard when 90 to 98 per cent cf
the scales are killed by its parasite.'
There Is but one generation of this
scale and its' parasite, so its work Is
According to the Modesto Herald a

Dairy herds in California are being
constantly improved. The day of na
tive cows with long horns is past.
Shorthorns, Jerseys and Holsteins have
come to remain. Alfalfa, which a few
years ago was not regarded as suited
to the making of high class butter. Is
now recognized as the ideal grass for
dairy stock, and the peculiar advantage
that a dairyman has in an alfalfa dis
trict is in the greater number of cows
that can be maintained. On alfalfa
fields the quantity of milk per cow is
greater than under, other conditions.
While ten cows and their increase can
be maintained well on. fifteen, at. most

IMPROVEMENT THE RULE.
The largest" creameries in the State
are in Los Angeles, Fresno, Stanislaus,
San Joaquin and Sacramento counties,
with capacity ranging from, about 325,
000 to 900,000 pounds of butter an
nually. The output of these institu
tions js capable of large increase with
out enlarging present manufacturing
capacity.
In cheese production the dairies and
creameries of the State have not
gained the high reputation earned for
butter. A large portion of the cheese
made is of ordinary quality, lacks rich
ness and flavor, and is marketed be
fore it is sufficiently aged to give it
the merit of Eastern product. The
quantity of cheese manufactured here
for the year 1902, according to the re
port of the State Dairy Bureau, aggre
gated but 6,503,441 pounds, represent
ing a value of $702,371.
Experiments have been tried in the
manufacture of the description of
cheese known as Chedder by such
dairymen as Dr. Flint of San Juan and
E. A. Davidson of Gilroy, but these
did not give satisfactory financial re
sults and were discontinued. Cheese
equal in merit to the Eastern product
was made, but the commission men in
San Francisco market preferred the
Eastern product because it could be
handled on a better margin of profit.
Consumers also gave preference to the
Eastern cheese.
One creamery is operating at Selma,
In Fresno County. The management
proposes to demonstrate the ability of
creameries here to compete on merit
with the Eastern product. None of the
Selma cheese has yet been placed on
the market nor will it be until It has
been aged at least six months and is
well matured. This product is aged
under the cold curing process.
The dairy industry in California is
largely in the hands of men who have
been bred to the business, Danes.
Swedes. Italian-Swiss and Portuguese.
Americans control about one-half the
dairies In the State. The business is
open to all, and there is no reason
why any class should be more success
ful than any other, with equal intelli
gence and experience. Near Sacra
mento, San Jose and Fresno the busi
ness is largely in the hands of Amer
icans. The number of American
farmers in this branch is rapidly in
creasing, particularly in the irrigated
districts and where the dairymen are
owners of the land, not renters.
Where the foreign element predomi
nates they are generally renters. .
GREAT PRODUCTION.
The tendency in butter-making is
more and more to creameries, but
there is a" disposition to decrease
rather than increase the number
of these factories. Experience seems
to demonstrate the claims that
large institutions can minimize the
cost of butter-making, and that un
der good business management, such
as is necessary to successfully con
duct large operations, dairymen secure
better results than by making butter
on the farms or working through
small creameries. Centralization of the
industry .in the respective districts
gives uniformity to quality and' to
some extent prevents unprofitable
competition in marketing the product.
standard in quality of the California
product and is usually sold at prices
slightly below the market for State
product
Prices of butter in San Francisco are
uniformly maintained on a higher basis
than are obtainable for creamery but
ter in the Middle West, and for this
reason under ordinary conditions deal
ers are able to make a fair profit on the
imported article, even when marketed
here at lower prices than the State pro
duct commands. This business is, how
ever, more or less speculative, and at
times Is attended with considerable
loss.
BY ARTHUR R. BRIGGS.
The dairy industry of California is
of all the first to give returns
to new settlers and is therefore en
titled to first consideration by home
seekers. The impression prevails that
there i s much to learn in farming in
California before one can hope to se
fur e a comfortable living and enjoy
the benefits which have been presented
to him as an inducement to come to
this State, but with the opportunity
for making a good living at the out
let, such as is presented in dairy farm
ing, the newcomer has time to make
himself familiar with the new condi
tions and enjoy a fair return from his
labor while he is studying the methods
<'f fruit growing and other branches of
farming.
The State Board of Trade has occa
sion to answer almost daily, "How can :
a living be made the first year?" and
â¢What investment is required for one
to establish himself on a profitable ba
sis in a new home?" The first ques- :
tion is already answered. The second
can only be answered in a general way,
but the following estimate of cost
should enable the average man to reach
a fairly correct conclusion of what is
necessary for him:
A FORTY-ACRE FARM.
Forty acres of land (with water
right) $2000
Buildings â house, barn, sheds,
fences, etc 850
Dc-mestic animals, horses, etc 400
Ten acres seeded to alfalfa first
year 100
Trees and shrubs about his house
and for family orchard and vine
yard 25
Farming utensil? and implements.. 75
Tota 1 53430
In the purchase of land it is not
necessary to make the full payment
the first year. One-third payment, or
say $e^0 to $700, is generally the rule,
and the balance can be carried one,
two and three years in equal amounts,
so that the actual cash outlay at first
need not exceed the sum of $2000 to
J25f>o. With this capital the intelligent,
ir.duptri jus and economical farmer may
safely establish a new home on forty
acres of land in California.
The dairy interest in California is
both interesting and important â inter
esting by reason of its possibilities, and
important from its present magnitude.
Dairy farming in this State may be
classified into the following principal
districts, viz.: The Humboldt district,
which comprises Humboldt and Del
Norte counties; the coast district,
which comprises the coast counties
from Mendocino on the north to Santa
Barbara on the south; the Sacramento
Valley district, which comprises the
country north of Stockton to Shasta
County; the mountain district, which
comprises Lassen, Plumas, Sierra and
Piskiyou counties; the San Joaquin
Valley district, which comprises the
territory from Stockton on the north
to the Tehachapi Range on the south,
and the Southern California district,
which includes all that part of the
State south of the Tehachapi Range.
DIFFERING CONDITIONS.
Conditions differ widely in these vari
ous districts, and yet generally the
quality of the butter produced is fairly
maintained at the average high Btan
dard for which this State is famed. Ac
cording to the last biennial report of
the State Dairy Bureau the quantity
of butter produced in the year 1902 was
21,525,762 pounds, representing a value
of 57,541,792, of which 21,593,021 pounds
was from creameries and 9,935,741
pounds from individual dairies, against
:*.678.439 pounds in 1897, of which 10,
Â£66,646 was from creameries and 17.811,
793 pounds from individual dairies.
This illustrates the growth of the in
dustry and the tendency of dairymen
to operate through creameries rather
than attempt to compete with these
institutions with butter made on the
farm, which is not as uniform in quality
or as high in grade as the creamery
product.
One of the principal features of dif
ference In the districts mentioned is the
character of feed. In the Humboldt dis
trict the industry is about stationary,
and the available range for cows is
pretty well occupied. In this district
there are about forty small creameries,
and most of the butter in the district
is manufactured by them. On the coast
there are but few creameries. This
district is not holding its own in butter
production owing somewhat to disad
vantage in feed, but also to the de
mand of San Francisco for milk, which
Is supplied from this source. The Sac
ramento Valley district is on the In
crease. Woodland, the vicinity of Sac
ramento and the reclaimed islands are
among the principal producing points
in thÂ« State. The mountain district,
though less important in point of quan
tity, holds its own. The San Joaquin
Valley district' exhibits rapid growth,
tbe estimated gain being 30 to 33 per
cent in 1903 as compared with 1902.
Here is a wide area in alfalfa, and this
in increasing largely from year to year.
Dairy herds, and dairy farming increase
in like ratib. The southern district de
nends on cultivated crops and alfalfa
[or feed.
INDUSTRY ESTABLISHED.
The industry as a whole is well es
tablished on a profitable basis through
out the State, though it has not yet
reached the limit of coast consumption.
Tal-en as a whole, the Industry now
represents a value, including the in
crease, begs. etc.. of upward of 518.
fOOOOO annually. The State Board of
Trade predicts that it will develop rap
dly in the future until California will
be shipping extensively toward Eastern
n:arkets. instead of standing In the list
Of dairy States as an importer.
At certain times in the year, when lo
cal conditions favor it. large quantities
of Eastern- made butter are now
chipped to the San Fra-ncisco market.
This butter does not come up to the
The Sacramento Union says of the
Sacramento Valley citrus fruit crop of
1903: "Oranges are being shipped in
large quantities from Sacramento Val
ley orange districts. The orange season
of this part of the State is now well
advanced and reoorts indicate a good
crop. The Oroville district reports spe
cial orange trains, the business exceed
ing the capacity of the regular trains.
The California Citrus Union, which is
handling the crop of the valley dis
tr cti?, is labeling the fruit v.ilh thÂ«
name of the locality where it is grown
in accordance with the law enacted by
the last Legislature."
The San Bernardino Dally Times-
Index says regarding the southern or
ange crop: "Unless all signs fail.
SoutheAi California will this year mar
ket the largest and best crop of oranges
In its history. Present conditions war
rant the prediction that the crop will
be from 25 to 50 per cent, larger than it
was last year, when 22.390 carload3 were
sent to market. The most conservative
growers and shippers estimate the crop
of 1903-4 judged by present conditions
and counting on fairly good weath-r
throughout the season, at 2S.00O car
loads, which is an increase over last
year of just about 25 per cent. Others
predict that 23,000 carloads is not too
high an estimate, if the weather con
ditions remain right for the next few
months. This would be an Increase of
nearly 50 per cent, over last season's
crop, and some optimists say prolonged
warm, growing weather and absence of
frost would expand the crop probably
to 35^000 or 36.000 carloads. Few are so
optimistic, however, as to anticipate a
crop of such enormnu3 dimensions."
According to the Merced Star, the
orange trees about the Courthouse
park in Merced produced 250 to 300
boxes of fruit.
A comprehensive plan of tree plant
ing has been proposed for Bakersfield
and Kern.
A first-class commercial hotel is to be
constructed at Redlands. The real es
tate men of the city are back of the
movement, so says the Redlands Facts.
The following figures of the shipments
in carloads of green aad dried fruit
from California for the season of 1902-3
arc published by the California Fruit
Grower:
Canned fruit, 7000: citrus fruit, 23,871;
dried fruit, 3812; prunes. 6567; raisins^
3600; fresh fruit. 8367; total. 53.217.
That is over 1000 cars per week for
every week in the year.
Other important shipments of farm
products' are as follows:
Almonds, 327; beans, 3300; beet sugar,
6100; canned vegetables, 1500; honey,
183; tomatoes, 2000; green vegetables,
5800; walnuts, 857; wheat, 50,000; total,
70,267.
Barley, oats, wine and other products
are not included. But even this is an
average of about 1350 cars per week,
or 225 cars per day.
The figures are calculated to staggor
even a Callfornian. At this rate we
shall before many years be shipping 500
cars per day, on an average, of prod
ucts of our farms and orchards.
TheColusa Sun says that free weekly
excursions to Colusa from Sit-is will be
given by the merchants of Colusa to
promote better acquaintance between
the people of the county.
The Santa Rosa Press- Democrat says
that the Supervisors of Sonoma County
will sell franchises for rural telephone
systems. Applications have been made
for franchises for telephone systems
for the .Russian River, Windsor and
Forestvllle sections.

Captain Smith. In command, reports
that when they were four days out from
Yokohama they ran into a series of ter- â¢
rifle squalls and storms which lasted for
ninety-six hours. The sea lashed itself
with furious force against the ship's
sides, and Purser Jerome says that
great seas forty feet high towered up
above the steamer's stern. The vessel
behaved admirably and rode the moun
tainous waves like a great duck. No
damage was done to the vessel herself*
but in the height of the gale a sea
struck one of the Chinese crew, swept
him across the deck and hurled him
with great violence against the rail,
breaking his lerr near the thigh, besides
otherwise bruising him and nearly scar
ing the life out of him. From Honolulu
on the weather was delightful. . . .

The formal announcement of the en

made yesterday by the young lady's
mother and was accompanied by the
statement that the marriage would be
celebrated during the early part of the
new year, probably ab.out the" middle
of February.
That Miss Mabel Cluff would soon
follow the example of her sister, who
was only recently married, was little
dreamed of by those who attended her
sister's wedding, and consequently
there was no little surprise expressed
when the engagement was made public.

and found Joseph Ramos and five
children, whose ages are 14 years, 5

Ramos said he had been a wood

and his wife had been committed to an
Insane asylum there. The county of

rent for his room, but had \*ery little
means left.
~Ramos said he had been unable to
search for employment, as he could
not find any one to look after his ba

Lebanon Presbyterian Church, cor
ner of Twenty-third and Sanchez
streets, held its Christmas services
yesterday. Rev. R. Logan, the pas
tor, preached the sermons morning
and evening. An excellent musical
programme was rendered and many
pretty anthems were sung. Among
the anthems given by the church
choir were: "Behold, I Bring You
Good Tidings" (Lyon). "Noel"
(Adam), 'Sing Unto the Lord" (Bier
ly), "Jesus, the Son, Is Born." ,
The text for the evening service was
taken from Luke, chapter 2, second
verse, and was as follows? "The
heavenly babe ir. swaddling clothes ly
ing in the manger." The Rev. Mr.
Logan delivered an excellent sermon.
He said the highest good js often
found in that which appears to be
mean and contemptible. He referred
to the examples of great men of the
world, and especially of some in this
country, who had risen from lowly
birth. He said: "In the babe of
Bethlehem. we see a union of the di
vine and human. It is sometimes dif
ficult to find the point at which the
natural and the supernatural meet.
That which seems to be accidental is
a part of God's plans. The long chain
of events in the Roman Empire and in
the Jewish history culminated in the
babe of Bethlehem. There are no ac
cidents in God's government; there is
a destiny that shapes our ends." The
last point brought out by Dr. Logan
was that "there is strength in appar
ent weakness."
Christmas Sermon Preached by the
Rev. R. Logan nt Sanchez and
Twenty-Third Streets.
LEBANON* PRESBYTERIAN"
CHURCH HOLDS SERVICES
I At the Howard-street Methodist
Church last night the pastor. Rev. A.
C. Bane, preached a sermon on thn
evils of gambling. The speaker used the
case of the .defaulting secretary of the
State University as an illustration. He
condemned not only the bookmakers
and managers of the tracks, but also
the city authorities who permitted gam
bling to be carried on openly. The vot
ers of the city also came in for a share
of criticism for failing to crush the
racetrack at the polls. Mr. -Sane said
in part:
The example before us is a deplorable one â
that of a young man who has ruined his career
confessedly for the sole purpose of squander-
Ing his earnings at the race track, yet public
i morals an 1 a; such a low ebb that the chances
! are he v.li? not be prosecuted ss strongly for
! the theft of upward of 540,000 as he would
be had he. taken but a $5 piece. It doÂ«s seem
as though the more a man steals the less
likely 1<Â» Is to ba punished. *
I read recently that as a result of this
theft the racing period Is to be shortened, not
stopped. â¢ We have laws providing that every
possible be used to exterminate chol
era, smalipox and bubonic plague, but these
have not claimed a hundredth part of the vic
tims the race track has. Who would ever
dream of the Legislature limiting the number
of days during which cholera should be per
mitted to rÂ»ire unchecked in our -midst? It is)
'â¢ truly a sad state of affairs when more atten
tion Is paid to the physical than the moral
man.'
After a hard fight by the press and pulpit
a short stop was p"ut to track gambling. Yet
a short tlnvÂ» afterward the people of this city
put the stamp of approval upon Rambling l>jr
re-electlnr the Mayor and Supervisors whu
favored legalized gambling. To say that rac
ing is permitted because of the horse
is nonsense, as the managers of . the
track admit that It would be profitless with
out gambling. The reason it exists Is because
It la able to pay to exist. McKowen says the
races are not conducted honestly. He should
know, because he has been there.
The liquor Interests and the racing Inter
ests seem to go hand In hand. It Is never
theless" a fact that many young men receive
their first lessons In gambling In what pur
port to be Christian homes. A game of pro
gressive euchre for a prize ts a gambling game
and .mar Implant In the breast- of some Chris
tian young man or woman an unconquerable
desire to play for higher stake*. This is not
only dangerous, but sinful, yet I learned re
cently to-, my dismay of a case of this kind
among my own congregation."
The speaker concluded his remarks by
urging young men to stay away from
cigar stands where wagers are taken
on the races or dice shaken* and from
the back rooms of saloons, where there
is always a temptation to engage in a
game of cards.
Pastor Takes Stand on Duties
of Wedlock Like That Pro

Â»
"Marriage" was the subject of a, ser
mon delivered at St. Mary's (Paullst)
: Church at the 11 o'clock service yester
day by the Rev. Father H. H. Wyman,
the rector.
Father Wyman dealt with the respon
sibilities of -wedlock and scored those
â¢who looked to the club and fraternal
eocicties for their life'8 pleasures.
Father Wyman in part said:
God bestows thÂ« highest of natural happi
:rÂ»ss in man when h* gives him a. family to
ilove and work for nnd to depend upon in his
â¢old arc. Those who give up marriage and
:tho lo\r of a family for ttM harrÂ«-n and fruit-
J3*s* i>lesÂ»urfs of the clubhouse and bachelor
â¢â¢apartment cheat themselves of th<? sweevast
Â¦natural joys that God can Rive to man.
. When rnpn substitute for the natural and
â¢ divinely instituted social life of the family
?ThÂ» artificial companionship of the club or
ffrarernlty they arÂ« Fimpiy 6i v :np "P the EUb
1 Fiance for the shadow of Joy. They are not
Â«nly pursoir.K a phantom, but are losing and
â¢ Trillins tKx> very object which was created to
fÂ«*tlsrfy their wants.
The root cf this evil '.Â» simply selfishnessâ
the desiri* to avoid labor and sacrifice, whereas
â¢ nature can give no real satisfaction or happi-
( T>ess !n anything that is not the fruit cf
iboth toil and w.If-drnlal.
This principle unlortunafly is utterly lc
rnry-d by many mrn of the world to-day. ThÂ«
'rby> t l=al comfort of the parsing hour is rrÂ«
'ferred toy tbt-in to tl** solid happiness which
,ji*ver diminishes. The human race is by
r.atur* a, family, rot a mere conglomeration of
: Individual with diverse interest.*. The weatk
.nesse-s and helplessness of childhood have to
[tM sustained by the etrrnsth and vipor cf
parents. h*>nre God fn the beginning estab
lished matrimony, bulldlne it by thÂ»> produc
tion of offspring of one blood with both father
And mother. â¢
Children, therefore, are man's most precious
â¢ j*pacy. They perpetuate npt only his name
â¢tat his own flcEh and bloodâ his very life.
Furthermore, marriage was instituted by
'<ir4 net merely for utility and convenience.
fr<it for the proparatfon of the human family.
*O<xS waid to our first par<\r.tÂ«. â¢â¢Increase and

{therefore. is the nursery ground of Christian
ity, ordained to fill the earth with 1Â«>I lever*

heaven.
Matrimony iÂ». as St. Paul Fay*, a. sreat

Shortly before noon yesterday the
two Japanese opened the iron door of
the chimney shaft and proceeded to
place the waste from the theater inside
the shaft- A back draught suddenly
get fire to the heap of rubbish and a
wave of flame enveloped the men.
Harry Campbell, treasurer of the
opera-house, and Mr. Van Eyton,
doorkeeper, rushed to the aid of the
Japanese. Campbell was burned on
the right hand in putting out the fire
that was consuming the clothes of
the two unfortunate men and Eyton
aJso suffered injuries.
Medical aid was summoned and the
Japanese were given every attention
and then sent in an ambulance to the
Central Emergency Hospital. They
were severely burned on the face artd
body and it is feared that both may
lose their eyesight.
The management of the Grand
Opera-house did everything possible
to aid the men who were burned and
will lee that all attention is given to
them.
I. Doi and C. Kawaguchf, Japanese
employes of the Grand Opera-house,
Â¦were severely burned yesterday -while
engaged In disposing of rubbish swept
from the interior of the theater.
The two men had gathered a quan
tity of paper arid dirt and conveyed
It to the base of the chimney of 'the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Works
on Jessie street, adjoining the theater.
It has been the custom of the Japan
ese to place the dirt ' inside the big
chimney shaft, where the flames and
