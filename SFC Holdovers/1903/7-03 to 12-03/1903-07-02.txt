as follows: " â¢
"The. Russian Government most posi

f ered any .explanation to the American
Government, either through- the Russian

embaesy at St. Petersburg, regarding the

feel called .upon to offer to the United

which no. other than Russian subjects
were concerned.
PRESIDENT STANDS FIBM.
The position of ' the administration re
garding the proposed transmission of the
petition" of Jewish citizens of the United
States to the Russian Government was
made clear and positive by.a "statement
issued by the StatÂ« Department to r niglit.
This- statement was inspired by the an
nouncement reflecting the attitude of the
Russian Govcrnment'in the'evcnt.of the
presentation of such a petition through
the . medium of. the United States' em
bassy at" -St. Petersburg. The Russian
statement .was cÂ»ven very careful con
sideration both here arid at Oyster- Bay.
befo'ro a:dcclsloh- was -reached to" make
any. declaration" regarding the question.
To-night the' following was -given out at
â¢the Stete .Department: . " ' .. â¢ â¢ "
"At the State Department it : was stated
by a high official, "In the absence. of Sec
retary Hay, that the delay In. forwarding
the petition of. the American citizens of
the Jewish faith as to the. Ill-treatment
of their â¢ coreligionists In Russia, was
due solely- tp the- petitioners' delay In pre
senting the address to the State Depart
ment. The. State Department, of course,
would pay no â¢ heed to ahy \ statement
purporting to emanate from, the Russian
Government unless" such' statement were
ma<le officially, in some form or other,
to our-." Government. . .. â¢
"The -State ."Department has been
especially careful to act only in accord
ance with all requirements, of -official pro-'
prlety, .but- .within | .the Ijmits* thus - laid
down It- will most certainly not. hesitate
to give expression to the' deep sympathy
felt not only by the admlnlstratiori, but
by all the American* people, for the un
fortunate', Jews who.. have been the-vk:
tims in. the ; recent appalling- massacres
and outrages. : . .. " â¢
EEBUKE TO THE CZAB.
"In this connection It wati- pointed by
another. . official,.- who disclaimed any pur-'
pose to speak Ixi. his j o'fflcial ' capacity,
however, .that it . seemed somewhat
strange, to say the least, that the Rus
sian Government should Choose this par
ticular method of Making a .statement .to
the American pepple/at the very time
when, by methods .which are certainly the
reverse of, friendly to the United. States,

BALJA' SHANNON (The Starting Point
of Gordon Bennett cup race), July 2, 6:10
a m ._ it is a fine morning for the'inter
national automobile race, though rain
threatened to . fall .at 1 one time. L. P.
Moers, the American racer, was the first
to arrive at the starting point. He ex
pressed his satisfaction with the treat
ment of the roads. In some places the
oil used to lay the dust lies in pools,
while elsewhere the motors raise clouds
of dust. Large crowds are . gathering
here. â¢
The, four competing teams will be as
follows:
Englandâ S. F. Edge, C. Jarrott and J.
W. Stocks.
Franceâ Chevalier. R. DekniftV M. Ear
man and M. Gabriel, p- â¢
Americaâ A. Winton, Percy Owen and
L,. P. iloers. 1,
Germanyâ Baron de Caters, Foxhall
Keene and M. Genatsey.
The' complicated system of stopping 1 the
cars at entrances of towns of Carlow,
Castle Dermot, Athy, Klldare. Monaster,
Evan and Stradbaly and deducting time
taken in passing through the towns, the
epeed in which must not exceed about
fourteen miles an hour, was shown by
experiments to-day to result in great
confusion and unless the race is better
managed than to-day's rehearsal the
winner will not be known until Friday.
Messrs. Winton, Moers and Owen are
regarded as the" dark horses in the race,
but neither of them is much fancied.
Jarrott and Gabriel (the latter made' a
new automobile record from Versailles to
Bordeaux, in the recent' Paris-Madrid
contest) generally figure as the favorites
although there is little or no betting.
Foxhall Keene. In his German car, is ex
pected..-to take all the chances that the
extraordinary roads and the numerous
curve3 afford.
There was the. usual difference of opin
ion as to Hanlon's future. Some experts
believe l he will never be a champion,
while others think; there 13 nothing to
stop his progress to that goal If, he can
learn to hit effectively. His attack is
lamentably weak, as he depends entirely
on swinging and not on straight hitting.
Hanlon did not have the royal chance of
winning ho' had with Young Corbett, but
at* 'that .'he would have made a better
showing had he gone in and mixed mat
ters more freely from the start.
It is a question if he is not subjecting
himself to too much punishment. He is
still under 20 years of age, and can ap
parently assimilate any amount. Not only
in the actual fight, but also In training,
he : taTtes an Incredible punching. v Nature
may. stand these overdrafts on his stock
of vitality for a time, but there must
come a day of reckoning if he continues
his present system of training and fight
ing. â¢â¢ â¢Â¦ Â¦ - - *
Frank Nell, the 115-pound wonder, offers
to fight either man at catchweights.
Yanger's right hand was puffed up from
the effects of a sprain sustained during
the fight, and gave him some concern.
The Injury was not evident during the
fight, the little Italian apparently not try
ing to spare the Injured member. He also
complained of a strained back, which he
said prevented him from leaning over In
the mixups. He will spend some time -at
the springs and may be seen in competi
tion here again.
Eddie Jlanlon and Benny Tanger were
about town yesterday, and both showed
the marks of their encounter on Tuesday
night.

Miss Edwards took the first set easily;
from Miss Coffin, but the second was long
and close. In this set Miss Coffin needed
" ; * court?, San Rafael. Ten of the
best players in. the northern part of the.
State competed. Of,. that number but two
were left at the ehd -of tVie day's play.
The successful tones Â¦were. Miss Eva Var
ney of. San Francisco and liiss Miriam
Edwards of Berkeley, j - Â¦ -
Although the. Sutton sisters were not
among the competitors, the tournament
was not lacking in class. The matches
were interesting and much closer than
usual. The best matches were those in
which Miss Varney beat Miss Hoffman
and Miss Edwards beat Miss Coffin of
Newport.
Miss Varney won the first set from Miss
Hoffman without the loss of a game, jane
it looked like a walkover for her. In" the
next two sets Miss Hoffman settled down
to Fteady play- and the match was ex^
ceedingly close. Miss Hoffman won the
second set, but the third and deciding one
went to Miss Varney. who maintained a
slight lead throughout.

ADHERES TO "IOWA IDEA."
I cannot allow this occasion to pass without
a~word respecting some differences cf opinion
in the Republican ranks as to the tariff and
reciprocity. We all stand firmly Â¦ for the pol
icy of protection. It is the fundamental
economic doctrine of the Republican party, .and
every Republican must believe in It. Btand for
it and advocate It. else he is not a Republican.
When, . however, we approach tha application
of the policy to our industrial affairs thtre is
room for honest differences of opinion, inil I
for one neither discmirage nor condemn the
fair, honest and frank expression of these dif
ferences of opinion. Some may believe that
there are schedules which should be' changed
now, some may believe that there are sched
ules . that should be changed next year, and
there are Â¦ others who may believe that the
schedules should ; not be changed at all: and
still they are loyal to the party and present a
united front to the common enemy. Â¦ *
The "stand patters"' secured control of
the committee on resolutions by a vote of
6 to 5. but in the committee on perma
nent organization the Cummins men con
trolled and elected N. E. Kendall of Albia
permanent chairman.- Kendall received
six votes to five for Secretary of Agricul
ture James Wilson, who was put forward
by the "stand patters" as a candidate
upon whom all should be able to agree.*
In his address accepting the nomination,
Governor Cumlmns said: # â¢ .
CONTROL OF COMHHTTEJIS.
The tariff plank adopted was one-pre
pared by ' Senator Allison . after " confer
ences with representative Republicans of
the State. Xo objection was. .made toit
in the committee on- resolutions nor on
its presentation to the convention.
Governor Cummins. In his speech "ac
cepting renomlnatlon. .approved the plat
form in. its entirety, but announced tb.at
he would continue to hbld.^o all the-vlews
expressed in his speeches within the past
two years. Senators Allison and Dolllver,
who made, speeches, -indorsed the platform
as- a correct statement "of -Republican
principles, but Congressman Lacey of the
Sixth District and Congressman Cousins
of the Fourth District spoke, in opposi
tion to tariff changes. â¢ â¢
While the action of the convention; was
entirely harmonious; both, wings of. the
party are claiming victory to-night, Gov
ernor Cummins and his supporters say
that to-day's tariff plank contains ln..s,ub
stance all that is found jn . last year's
plank, while the "stand patters" are con
gratulating themselves upon the Â«"j.miria
tion of the "shelter to the trusts" clause,
which attracted so much attention to the
Iowa platforms of 1901 and 1902.
There .were but two contests to-day in
volving the questions of relative strength
of the two wings of tfce party and th.cse
ended with honors even.

Tlie essence of ,free government Is govern

President of -the. United' States in his recom

IOWA PLATFORM HARMONIZES IDEAS
I- have listened,* as. you all have, to* the plat

It must be expected that 'If -a few of us

fore It Is that I ehall expect to do what I can
to properly promote the -polities which wo
have promulgated here fo-day.
Congressman Cousins was next called
on and 'in a speech strongly upheld the
Dingl^y-law. - '
Calls for Lacey brought tnÂ© Congress
man from the Sixth district to his feet
and he spoke, as follows:
â¢ Like my- friend Cousins. I am a "stand
patter from' Stand-PattersvJUe." . I am not
here to apologize for the.IMngley law. but to
promise- that none of its .material benefits to
this country shall be disturbed by my votÂ».
But I recognize that other gentlemen', some of
whom do not have the same responsibility to
vote upon the question, would perhaps do
otherwise. . ' â¢
â¢Then- ensued -thÂ« .most remarkable

he was slttlrg and made his .way across. â¢

Without taking his relatives 'Into the
secret, William W. Hush, son of Mr. and
Mrs. Valentine Hush of Fruitvale, leaders
In exclusive society circles on both sides
of the. bay, was married last night to
Miss Julia X. Talbot, a daughter of . W.
IT. Talbot, residing at Jackson and Scott
streets. So secret was the affair that the
members cf the Hush family declared-last
night that they did not even have the
slightest acquaintance with' the bride,
had never heard of her, and were â¢ com
pletely at sea about the matrimonial em
barkation of the young man.
According to . the < benedict's ! relatives
they were given a surprising shock yester
day afternoon by the announcement In
the press of the engagement of young
Mr. Hush and Miss Talbot. It was evi
dent * from later developments that the
announcement -was but a forerunner of
a well-planned secret wedding. I,at<! las;
evening Mr. Hush made application to
Deputy County clerk H. E. Maglll of
Oakland for a marriage license for him
self and Miss Talbot. As soon as the
after hours document could be prepared
the expectant groom and his bride-to-be
repaired quietly to the parlors of the First
Presbyterian Church, Oakland, where the
Rev. Dr. John Rich officiated at the mar
riage. The bride and groom departed at
once, without leaving word of their des
tination, which, however, is known to be
this city, and at midnight* had failed to
notify the Hush family , of the nuptial
ceremony."
In the engagement announcement which
was so startling to the Hushes the bride
prospective was pen pictured as a charm
ing and talented young woman, possessed
of rare musical ability. It was averred
that she had declined many flattering of
fers to take up a professional career, but
had resolutely put aside the ambitious
proffers because of parental objections.
FurtheV It was declared that the wedding
was to take place In -August or Septem
ber, to be followed by a tour abroad. But
the. Hushes, as a result of last night's
developments, believe that there was pur
pose to mislead them in the announced
time for the event.- Â»

made by Willis S. Hall; a prominent so
ciety leader and an intimate friend of the
young groom. Hall visited Earl S. Blng
ham, superintendent of the First Presby
terian Church Sunday-school, and asked
for permission to use' the edifice for the
ceremony. Being Informed that the-regu
lar pastor was out of the city, he made
inquiry concerning others, and Rev. Dr.
Rich, who has retired from the ministry
and who resides at Tenth and Alice
streets, was recommended to him.
Hall brought Dr. Rich, to the church,
where Miss Talbot was waiting. A li
cense had been secured in the meantime,
and the ceremony proceeded, with none"
but. Hall and Bingham as witnesses.
Hush's relatives had gained an inkling of
the prospective wedding and searched the
city, to interfere.
But the 'groom, with the assistance, of
his friondi cleverly outwitted them, and
after the benediction had been given the.
couple. took a boat for this city. Hush's
relatives declare that they know nothing
of his wife. They say the affair was 'a
surprise to them and that they had no
knowledge of the announcement or of the
ceremony. ' . Â¦ *

CURVATURE OF "fHE EARTH-G. S..
City. The curvature of the* earth # 's sur- ' â¢
face cannot be perceived . by the 'eye in).
merely- gazing upon if from. an Â«levatibn; {
this is because the vision -Is, not capable â¢'
of "the comparison of height^ etc.. neces- j
sary to pferceive this* curved surface. -"But k
comparison of the height- of objects at va
rious distances will prove -the"' .fact of â¢
curvature plainly. For a statute mile the
curvaturfe is 8.99 inches.; for a geographi- . .
cal or nautical mile if is 7.633 inches. Its
effect upon the visibility of objects may 'â¢
be thus illustrated: " it a pane of glass is
held- against a globe the objects, will touch '
only at -one point, the. globe" surface con-- !
tinually falling away from the glass. Sup
pose the ocean to be" calm and froxeh and
a great level sheet of gla'ss be'. lajd upon
it. At one mile from the tangent point
the ocean fall* nearly eight- Inches below
ths glass:, at three miles, six feet;at nine
miles, more than fifty-four feet.' and so
on.- The number of feet of depression is
equal to. "two-thirds jof (he square of the I
number of miles ;for any observable -dis-.
tanci>. But in estimating. the visibility. of
objects it must be -noticed .that this de
pression is partially eanceledby the'phe
nomena of refraction, :whlch. cause ob
jects to appear higher than they would if
there was no atmosphere." Careful meas
urements have showft that, the, errors
from refractWn average rather more fhan"
one-seventh of ' that" from curvature. The
rule, therefore, commonly, used for- correc
tion ot -and. refraction ' is":
Square the number. of miles and take"
four-sevenths of it for the correction fn .
feet... Thus, if an object" is visible at a
distance of five miles, we may know that
Its height is about- fourteen and one-third
feet. Or, if the height of a visible object
is" knownâ say 100 feetâ take one- fourth of
this, mult.ip.ly by 7. and take the square
root of this product, which gives the dis
tance of the object, in. this case 'a frac
tion. morÂ£: than thirteen miles. The error
frequently made In computations* of this*
kind is that there is not- taken tnto ac
count the elevation <>f the observer as
well as of the! object observed. .* A man
swimming on the surface of the -water .
can perceive a tower 200 feet high and
nineteen miles. away as a mere speck on
the horizon, but if the man were elevated
100 feet above the surface of the. water he
could -plainly^ perceive a tower' half the
height of 'the other;-on a horizon : fully
twenty-six miles distant.

LAST year the country began about this time to
be disturbed by that drifting of money from
New York to the West and South that even
tually produced a money stringency in Wall street
and brought about a condition that forced the Sec
retary of the Treasury to use the money of the na
tion to relieve private business. When the flurry
was over last fall we were told it would not* happen
again, that the bankers would take proper precau
tion?, and even-thing would go smoothly in future.
Reassurances of that kind were given last .winter
when Congress failed to enact the desired currency
legislation, and all through the spring they were re
peated v.ith equal emphasis from Washington and
from New York; but now that the crop moving sea
son is at hand we get another story.
Only a short time ago the Chicago Tribune stated
that Chicago banks had prepared for the Western
demand for money by withdrawing upward of $20,
000,000 of their deposits from New York banks, and
went on. to say: "The funds taken from the East
last fall and since that time have not been returned,
and when the money firmness arrives this fall the
Eastern institutions will be saved .withdrawals to
the amount mentioned. At the same time Chicago
banks are building their reserves to a higher point
than they were at this time last year, and are expect
ing to go into the autumn demand with 30 per cent
ot cash. While Chicago has drawn on its New
York balances, "country correspondents of Chicago
institutions have been doing the same thing here,
and the West now has its surplus funds well* dis
tributed."
A similarly cheerful view was presented a short
time ago by the Omaha Bee, which in a review of. the
situation said: "It appears from the last report of
the Comptroller of the Currency that the chief finan
cial centers representing the West â that is, the finan
cial region this side of the Central States â have on
deposit almost $220,000,000. a figure which New York
would hare not much more than matched only, a few
years ago. U therefore appears that money, is plen
tiful in the West, and, according to the statistics,* is
being" used to goad profit, since the banks which
are made the basis of comparison report unusual in
dividual profit*."
Such reports arc excellent, but unfortunately the
Eastern reports do not confirm .the cheerful outlook
of Â»he West. A recent despatch from Chicago to

IT is not pleasant to read that the Atlantic steamer
lines propose a rate war on steerage tickets from
Europe. The low rate already charged, which
is about $8 from Hamburg, has greatly influenced
the enormous and unwelcome immigration to this
country from Southeastern Europe. To make a lower
rate will simply make it easier for Europe to sewer
upon this country the crime, disease, disorder and
lawlessness of the continent. Time was, when the
tillable land on the public domain was open to set
tlement, that we were benefited by the coming of
immigrants from Northern Europe, who were intel
ligently attached to our free institutions and were
willing to go into the fertile wilderness and make
farms and assimilate with us. That immigration put
a strong and useful strain into our blood, and those
descended from it are now among the best of our
citizens.
But tho-se lands on the public' domain are all taken.
The immigration we are receiving now adds pain
fully to the congestion of our great cities, packs the
tenement quarters beyond the -possibility of proper
sanitation, and festers in the vices of an overcrowded
population. While this is going on Americans are
going by thousands into the Northwest Territory of
Canada, taking up good farming. and grazing lands
and doing for the Dominion what the immigration
from Northern Europe did a half century ago for the
United States. , / _, "
" It requires no wizard to see what will happen to
this country if we continue these two processes. The
spring that loses clean water and gains dirty water
steadily sooris becomes a 'foul fountain! It is* a com
mon experience to read of great bodies of non-Eng
lish speaking foreigners, in some part of the coun
try, who are banded together in* labor strikes and
are defying the law. destroying property arid'com
mitting murder, and who "can be -controlled. only by
the strong military' arm of the Government. They
fill the places in all occupations that should be occu
pied by our own oncoming generations, and are a
nterely physical increment, dangerous to the peace
of the country.^ If the _ Atlantic s,teamer lines propose
to lure more of them by cheaper rates, there ought
to be American statesmanship enough in Congress
to narrow the . gate through . which this - unwelcome
stream is pouring, and check it until digestion and
assimilation have got through with the overload that
we have already taken in..

MRS. WILLIAM WESLEY BUR
NETT. WHOSE WEDDING
WAS ONE OF NOTE.
It may be that at some date in the far distant future
the people of the United States will devise some fitter
and more worthy means of celebrating the glorious
Fourth, but the change is not likely to come in our
time. With us the day will remain chiefly a day for
the glory of the small boy. The orations, the pa
rades and the poems will count as but decorative
features of a theater mainly occupied by a host of
patriotic and exuberant boys exulting in the roar of
firecrackers. So we must do our best to make that
form of celebration as safe as it is joyous. If every
householder will but take care of his own premises
there will be do danger for the city. It will not be
difficult to exercise the simple precautions required
for such care, and it is to be hoped they will be duly
observed by all.
SAN FRANCISCO has never had a great fire.
No Fourth of July celebration has ever been
marked within our confines by any conflagra
tion big enough to be called a calamity. Conse
quently we approach the great holiday with little or
none of that anxiety that is felt in almost every big
city in the East. It is nevertheless worth our while
to give some heed to the issue and exercise precau
tion against probable dangers.
We have good ordinances regulating the sale and
the use of fireworks of all kinds during the holiday;
we hsve a good police force to see that the law is
obeyed and a good Fire Department to meet any
emergency that arises. . We rightfully enough repose
confidence in what has been done in that way by the
city authorities to prevent the occurrence of any
such disaster as some that have well nigh swept away
towns and cities in the East. The city, however,
cannot do everything. The citizen should do some
thing. A little carefulness on the part ; of every
householder during the next few days will not entail
much of work or trouble upon any one, and yet it
may be the means of avoiding serious fires.
TIME FOR PRECAUTION
Another amusement has been added to the already
long list of summer attractions 'of Monterey County.
In the San Lucas mountains some campers discovered
a lion which,' after' whipping, tlieir dogs, ; attacked
one of their own. number. The dispatch says the
man wa., armed with an antiquated revolver and that
"when the lion rushed upon him lie shoved the
weapon down its throat, but as he had not cocked
it in the excitement it did not go off." At this junc
ture the man's companions, probably wishing to save
the revolver, slew. the lion and extracted the pistol
from its threatened oblivion."

PERSONAL MEtNTlON
REDDING. July 1.â The wild man, who
has bcerr terrorising residents east of the
river from Redding, has- been captured
and now occupies a cell In the County
Jail. His name is J. S. Tratler. When
found he was lying in a hole beneath the
overhanging vines" on the bank of -the
river and from all appearances he had
been there several days and had sub
sisted entirely on fruit. He talks in a
rambling way. When asked why. he left
Keswlck he said that - they vvexr' trying to
throw him into the molten slag on thi
slag dump. ' He said that there were more
than 200 men buried beneath the molten
Blag and that they were thrown there to
be got out of. the way.

trymen. . .
win. but to be regarded as worthy of reward, which
has not" always been the case with party chairmen
who have led. a successful fight. He entered the Sen
ate, new to legislation, wearing as a badge of honor
the spiteful detraction of the opposition, his literary
quality unknown, and no one surethat he could
.think and talk on his feet. He was known only as a
business man who- had been from his youth the
busiest of men. But in the Senate he stood with the
leaders and has presented not merely an interesting
but an engaging personality, has sustained himself
in- running debates and has highly uttered the politi
cal principles fostered by him when his leadership
was young. He has retained to a remarkable degree
the confidence of the sound money men of the coun
try with, whom he allied in 1896. In 1000 he did not
have to conjure" them into new activity. They came
as volunteers.
IT is given out, apparently by authority, that Sen
ator Hanna will resign the chairmanship of the
Republican National Committee and .leadership
of the party next year. This is to' be a wholly volun
tary act on his part, and the organiration will have
the benefit of his experience and his continued inter
est in the coming campaign.
The Senator's career in politics has many remark
able features. Long a close personal friend of Major
McKinlej', and a believer in his star, he was unknown
in politics during all the years in which his friend was
achieving a career in Congress and making himself
known as one of the strong men to whom the coun
try would likely turn in an emergency. In the na
tional convention of 1806 he had charge of the Mc-
Kinley forces at the beginning of the deliberation of
that body, and. at the end his friend was the party
candidate for President and he was general in chief
of the campaign.
He was the first to perceive the direction of.pub
lic sentiment to be toward the currency issue, and he
immediately put the party upon high ground on that
question. In this it is known that he acted against
the advice of men older in leadership than he. They
trembled and turned pale at the threat of Senator
Teller to lead a bolt if the party declared for the gold
standard. But he wanted Teller and those who
stood with him to bolt. The Republican party had
been turned so far toward free silver and unsound
money that it needed the affirmation of its sound
money position by just such a bolt.
Looking back at that time of trial one sees now
very, clearly that the Teller bolt caused the Gold
Democratic organization and created the bond of
fellowship that joined all the sound money men of the
country 'together. â¢ Mr. Hanna knew that parties are
like men, not always trusted when they shout their
own virtu.es, but sure to be when others call those
virtues vices and go forth to accuse. When others
wanted o the campaign made on the tariff he, made it
a campaign of education on the money question,
not merely to win, but to keep promises after win
. No such campaign w:as ever seen before, nor will
its like be seen again. In the perspective in which
those days are seen now it is perfectly plain that Mr.
Bryan would have been elected if Mr. Hanna had
permitted the ignoring of the silver issue and/ made
it a tariff campaign. His \vas great generalship. It
had the effect of turning the fight upon him person
ally, and no part}- leader has been as much abused.
The leading Bryan paper in New York went far be
yorrd partisan abuse and wallowed into libel of the
grossest sort, in the hope to provoke a damage suit,
in order to pose as a martyr. But Mr. Hanna had
other work than personal punishment of liars, and,
with his usual keen perception of the reality of
things, knew that to win was the proper way to dis
cipline the journalistic brutes who have no higher
conception of politics than as a game of deception.
Mr. Hanna had the singular fortune to not only
NEW LEADERS AND OLD.
CAPTURE WILD
MAN AND LAND
HIM IN PRISON
the Ne>v York Evening Post stated that there are
more borrowers seeking money than money seeking
borrowers in Chicago, and that a like condition pre
vails in most of the Western centers. It is further
stated that while the reports of the Comptroller, of
the Currency show that in Chicago bank reserves
were larger in percentages on June 9 than in April,
they were less than" in July last year. In St.
Louis they were larger than at either" date, but the
excess over last July was very slight. In Detroit the
percentage of reserve was only a trifle larger than it
was last July. In Kansas City, Kans., it was less.
In Cedar Rapids and St. Joseph the percentage of
reserves was smaller on June 0 thanin- April, and in
the last-named city it was less than in July last.
It thus appears' that we are likely to have "another
proof of the importance'bf providing an clastic cur
rency to meet the requirements .-of- our annual crop
moving season. There is no' danger' of a serious
stringency, but there will be some pressure upon the
banks, and were it not- for the prosperous condi
tion of the country the pressure might be harmful.
As' we cannot tcount on prosperity all" the time/pru
dence dictates. that- we take-advantage of the present
season to put our currency system in proper, shape
to resist disaster when it comes.

Attorney General Knox
Renders an Opinion
of Interest
Immigration Laws Apply to
Chinese as Well as
Others. -
An Important opinion was received from
Attorney General Knox yesterday by
United States Immigration Commissioner
Hart H. North in the matter of the denial
of the landing of Wong Joe Jun, who ar
rived on the steamship Siberia on May 15.
Wong claimed to be the son of a mer
chant domiciled in the United States and
on that ground claimed tb^e right to en
ter. The Immigration Bureau, finding
that he was afflicted .with a contagious
disease, took the matter out of the hands
of the - Chinese Bureau and denied him
admission under the act providing for. the
exclusion of all aliens having such dis
eases. Alfred Worley, attorney for, Wong,
appealed to the Secretary of the Treasury
and contended that the general immigra
tion laws did not appjy to Chinese, and
that their admission or rejection was to
be determined solely upon the provisions
of the exclusion act.
The following is a quotation .from the
opinion: â¢Â»."'.
One of the classes of persons intended to be
excluded from the United States by this act
is composed of "aliens afflicted with a loath
some or with a dangerous contagious disease."
There is nothing in the laws specifically relat
ing to the immigration of Chinese persons pro
viding for the exclusion of a merchant or mem
ber of any other excepted class, although he
may be suffering from a loathsome or dan
gerous contagious disease; and unless the act
now under consideration is applicable* to him,
such person may enter the United States with
impunity and the public must suffer the con
sequences. I can see no valid reason for con
cluding that the Congress intended ' by the
proviso in question, to imperil the public safe
ty by allowing a diseased person, because of
his Chinese descent, to enter, when the very
law In which this proviso appears had. as one
of its special purposes, the further and more
effective protection of the public from the
evil consequences to be expected as a re3ult
of the presence of one so afflicted and to this
end prescribed his exclusion. The -history of
our lav.-s relating to Chinese immigration for
bids the conclusion that the coming of any
persons of that nation into the United States
was regarded as more to be desired than that
of other aliens, or that special favors were
Intended to be shown them.
To admit a Chinaman known to be suffer
ing from a contagious , disease, when another
alien not bo descended would be excluded be
cause affilcted with the same disease, would,
to that extent, defeat the legislative intent
made clear by the terms of the act. and ap
parently lead to unjust and unexpected re
sults.' "Nothing Is better settled than that
statutes should receive a sensible construction,
such as will effectuate the legislative intention
and. if possible. 'so as to avoid an unjust and
absurd conclusion." (Lau Ow Ben vs. United
States, 144 U. S.)
I am unable to conclude that the proviso in
section 36 was intended to entirely prohibit
the application of said act to persons of Chi
nese descent. The object of this proviso. I
think, was to prevent misinterpretation of the
repealing clause in the same section, and to
forestall any attempt to secure the admission
of Chinese theretofore prohibited from enter-
Ing the United States under a claim that this
act alone was Intended to contain all pro
visions regulating the immigration of aH
aliens and expressly repealed all laws in con
flict therewith â the Chinese exclusion laws
among them. The language of this proviso is
radically different from "that this act shall
not apply to Chinese persons," the term usrd
In the act of March 3. 1903. and this chango
tn language Is indicative of a like change of
purpose. "_;Â¦ "
I therefore advise you that Wong Joe Jun,
the applicant for admission. If found to bo
suffering from a dangerous contagious diseaso
In the way specified In the act. belongs to one
of the classes of aliens which should be ex
cluded from the United States under the terms
nnd provisions of the act of March 3. 1903..

HARRY WALTERS
AGAIN IN JAIL
A number of artists who have made
reputations for themselves while Illus
trating the newspapers and magazines of
San Francislco will give an exhibition of
their work in the Maple room of the Pal
ai-e Hotel, the date for which is not yet
fixed. In all respects this picture show
will bo more comprehensive than any of
a similar nature given heretofore. While
newspaper illustration will be largely ex
emplified, the scope will be sufficiently
wide to demonstrate that the illustrators
compare favorably with their brethren of
the studios in ability.
It has been arranged to have all the
pictures matted and put up for exhibition
in good shape. In addition to work that
lias attracted public attention when re
produced in the public prints, -there will
be art works of an elaborate sort spe
cially prepared for the exhibition. The
process of reproduction as employed in
the newspapers and magazines will form
a special feature of the exhibition, the
scope being from the beginning to the
end. Among the artists who will exhibit
are the following named:

DELIGHTFUL ENTEHTAINMENT
FOR AMELIA BINGHAM
: Martiniana Belosa, a Filipino merchant,
who has been living at 1459 " Franklin
street, was robbed of nearly lA/00 in jew
els and coin by his valet,- Zacarals. Reyes,
on Tuesday. Captain of Detectives Mar
tin and Detective Ed Gibson landed the
thie-t in the City Prison last night and
recovered most of the stolen property.
Belosa, who is wealthy, came here a
short time ago for the purpose of plac
ing his children in schools. He brought
Reyes with him and never suspected the
integrity of his tervant. Much to his
surprise the valet disappeared on Tues
day afternoon and when he did not re
turn yesterday morning a search was
made and the coin and Jewels were found
to have gone with him. Among the articles
were a buffalo horn ring set with four
large diamonds, two large diamond studs
and two smaller ones, $140 in Filipino coin,
$125 in foreign gold, $112 In Spanish gold
and about $70 in Spanish silver.
Captain Martin and Detective Ed Gib
son soon located the valet and j brought
him to the Hall of Justice. He returned
a portion of the coin and all of the dia
monds. Some of the money went to pur
chase him a ticket to New York and more
to satisfy his vanity. He had bought. a
gold-headed cane, a watch and chain and
some expensive neckwear. It was hi3
intention to depart for the East as soon
as he could leave this city in safety, but
the detectives nipped his plan in the bud.
YOSEM1TE VALLEY, July 1.â Ben Gar
ren of 416 Mason street, San Francisco,
was found to-day after being lbst for
more than thirty-six hours In the can
yons leading off toward Little Yosemite.
Garren left the Glazier Point Hotel yes
terday morning on a fishing trip up the
Illilouette River above the falls, and, be
coming confused in the labyrinth of the
valley that branches off from the south
east portion of the Yosemite he lost his
way and wandered around all night hunt
ing for the way out. Searching parties
were organized by Guardian Stevens and
late to-night Garren was found and re
turned to the Glazier Point 1 Hotel. His
clothes were torn to shreds by* his weari
some scramblings over the sharp rocks
and his flesh badly bruised. K/.'-^.v*
Another story of the trouble leaves Les
lie out entirely and makes Roach the at
tempted peacemaker. It is said that Gil
son fired at Roach and struck him, not
withstanding the fact that- the bullet
glanced. ,
Detective Bailey investigated the mat
ter and landed the men in jail. Roach
was taken to the Emergency Hospital.
Mrs. Boyce suffered considerably from
the shock and was too ill to leave her
room. She w'as formerly the wife of a
saloonkeeper.
During a row in the Elite . lodging
house at 207 Kearny street last evening
James Roach, a Morse policeman* doing
duty in Chinatown, was shot .in the leg
by James Gllson, a furniture polisher.
The bullet in its flight passed through the
fingers of the landlady, Mrs. M. A. Boyce,
over whom the row occurred. Gilson was
arrested and with him John Leslie, a
messman on the steamer Columbia, who
was present when the shot was fired.
There are two Versions of the affair.
Gllson was extremely jealous of Mrs.
Gllson and this -mood was intensified by
liquor he had been drinking for three
weeks. Both he and Leslie are rpomers
in the house and the two were in a room
with the woman when Gllson grew ugly
and started a quarrel. Roach, who is also
a lodger, came In to pay his rent and re
mained in the hope of pacifying the quar
reling men. . ; -Â¦ '
Gilson finally threatened to do harm to
the woman and reached for his back
pocket. Leslie is said to have interfered
and Gllson attempted to fire in his direc
tion. The bullet, however, struck Mrs.
Boyce on the knuckle, glanced off and
hit the Morse patrolman in the leg. The
latter's injuries are not of a serious na
ture.

AN INVESTIGATION
The purchase of gloves and gauntlets
has been part of the work of the division
of the quartermaster general's, office", of
which Colonel "William S. Patten is head.'
Colonel Patten %aid to-day that he re
membered very well the. Lyon contracts,
and that Lyon had been the contractor
for these supplies for a number of years.
He declared, however, that Representa
tive Littauer had never, to his knowl
edge, sought to Influence the awarding of
any contract.-. Â¦ ' Â¦
It is said that there 1? no doubt that
proceedings can now be Instituted under
the law to recover the money paid to
Lyon. for goods which he supplied, and
which, it can be shown, came from the
firm of Littauer Bros. Any. prosecution
of Representative Littauer for violation
of'vthe statutes prohibiting members of
Congress from . being interested in con
tracts with the Government " will depend
upon the result of the investigation.

They hare done wonders for me. I was a '

have my share of the aches and pains from
the hardship that usually, falls to the lot of
the soldiers who saw service. "Anti-Pain Pills
never fail to relieve the rheumatic twinges,
headache or other pains. A number of old
comrades in this vicinity who have used Dr.
Miles' Restorative Tonic, Nervine and Nerve

Rheumatic . twinges, headache, and the

are affected too seriously to right themselves,
and prompt treatment is necessanr. The best
treatment consists of Dr. Miles' Restorative
Nervine, which restores vitality to the nerves
and helps them to throw off various disorders
which bring about pain and suffering. There
is nothing so good tor the stomach and bow-

TO the sound of martial music
played by the band of the Twelfth
Cavalry, stationed on her prom
enade deck, theâ army transport
Sherman. Captain Bruguiere in
command, left Folsom street wharf yes
terday promptly at noon and commenced
her long voyage to the Philippines. As
she drifted into the stream a regiment or
two of army girls wigwagged good-by
from the wharf, and with smiles and
tears on their pretty faces gave the big
trooper and her soldier passengers as
handsome a send-off as feminine America
ever accorded to anybody.
Â¦ . The Sherman, looking spick and span
in her clean, white paint and shining
brasswork, is taking to Manila a large
number of passengers and a big load of
army freight. She has on board the
third squadron, headquarters and band of
the Twelfth Cavalry and the Seventeenth
United States Infantry-. Captain "William
T. Bittebrant is in command of the cav
alrymen, and Colonel D. J. Craigie is in
charge of the foot soldiers.
In addition to the abover^the Sherman
has 127 cabin passengers. These include
the officers accompanying the troops, the
wives and families of some of them, other
army officers and army families going to
join their commands or on special duty, a
few. navy officers, 'some civilian employes
and a few young ladies going out to be
married.
Following is a complete list of the cabin
passengers:

Do You Want a Trunk Â»
SAN FRANCISCO. June 10. â Dear Otto:
When "you | receive tills letter I will be no
longer among the living, for through my dark
thoughts during the last month I have become
callous to everything. With deepest affection
for my . daughters I hope they will not grlÂ«ve
over me when I am gone.
From memoranda found in the pocket
book of the dead man it appeared that his
name was G. Warricker and that he had
come to this country from Germany nine
years ago. Later in the day M. J. Green
way, who works on the \ ferry steamer
Berkeley, identified the remains as, those
of OttoWarkanie. He said that Warka
nie was 68 years old, that he was sepa
rated from his- wife and that he had a
daughter in this city.
To My Daughters: "Why did you let mt
come to America, now that you have taken
my mean3 of existence over there away? I
must go }nto another country to all of us un
known up to this time. Think of me In sor
row, for painful is the horror of death. Ter
mlt the departed one to enjoy his peace, and I
will grant you my thanks.
Without receiving assistance I have now to
receive death, and the exile which you have
given me is ' worse â¢ than death by water.
Minna alone is the cause of my death.
The dead body of an' elderly man was
found yesterday morning hanging by the
neck to a beam In the rear of Fulda's
Mill, 32 Spear street. Two notes, writ
ten in German, of which the following
is a translation, were found on hia per

â¢.lie rate had no other -effect than a moderate
recovery fmm tlie earlier deprcBEion in the
market, due to covering of shorts by profes
sional tAirSers, The recovery hailed at about
law night"* hivt\ and the closing mas rather
: heavy. rVesttrday's suddan advance of over 2
.points In United St&te-i Steel jn-cferred. which
â¢ was coincident â¢with the return to the; street
after a long absence of a noted o-jeratof. con
sp'icuousMn the flotation period of the United'
States fo'eel securities, -had some hope that a
new bull campaign was to be undertaken in
tlio*>e fcM'uritir-p under syndicate auspices, but
the 'inert ia of the preferred stock in the neigh
borhood *â¢}{_ 62. which is the subscription price
. offered t;> "employes, strengthened the surmise
that that price level was the objectlvrfof yes
terday's ?npvement. Xcwb of the corporation's
affairs caused a hope that the recent pressure
of liquidation has not been completed and
there were rumors current that the holdings
'recently â¢ In ctrurse of liquidation had been
taken care of.
' The second mortgage bonds were lifted about
a point during the 'morning, but did not hold
Â»â¢â¢',!. London was a conspicuous seller during
the morning and. this was a considerable fac
Â¦f-r In the heaviness of the market. Some re
covery' In the exchange market also resulted
and an advance In the price of American gold
coin In Loudon was also noted. To-day's
-clearing-house balances footed up |24,597,40O.
which is close to the high record level and Is
a â¢ reflection of yestirday's heavy financial
transactions incident to the turn of the fiscal
ytar Tbe renewed strength In the cotton mar
ket-, disappointed the hopes' that the violent
speculation there* was not a culmination nnd
tne firmness of the corn market was aUo a
detriment to stocks, although the sharp reac
tion In wheat was favorably .regarded. Atchl
son and Southern Pacific were carried a iwlni
under la'st night at one time. The weakness
ofiColorado Fuel was due to the existence of a
large order In liquidation. Sugar suffered frJrn
tne marking down of the price of the produc
tion and thÂ« weakness In the London copper
market affected Amalgamated.
The bond market was quite firm, but not ac
tive outside of United States Hteel- second 6t.
Total -sales, par -value, $2,330,000. United.

â¢ NEW TORK, July 1. â The vewly awakened
jiope on the part of commission brokers of a
tevlval speculation which prompted the Ex

"received a j-etback to-day. All the anlmatio.i
â¢was gone from the market and the apathetic
"Â¦onditioijs of la.Â«t -week seemed to be rene*el

sion houses, together with the advance in corn,
caused a flrmfr feeling early â¢ In the day and
the price advanced gradually to 7t>Hc but later
reacted again on a less urgent demand. The
weakness at St. Louis, due partly to the ar
rival there of several cars of new wheat, was
a bear factor late in th<Â« day. After selling
at 75>4c September closed -"4c lower at 7&'<.1jÂ»

The fruit market was in fairly good shape,
good stock moving oft* well under a steady lo
cal demand. Receipts of fruit In baskets from
the river were light anÂ«l prtcÂ«-s for such stock
were firmer particularly Peaches, which made
a sharp advance. Apricots and Peaches, in
small shipping packages were firmer also un
der limited supplies but Plums. Prunes and
other fruits similarly packed were In free sup
ply and easy, except for the very best stock.
Figs were slightly firmer, offerings being of
better quality than .previously. There were
heavy shipments received from Vacarllle late,
in the day that were held over for to-day's
market. Apricots In bulk from the river sold
off well, the canners being the principal buy
*rÂ». Occasional lots of the- best stock sold to
the trade at H per box. A car load of Water
melons and one of Cantaloupes came In from
Coachella and moved off well, the demand be
ing good owing to the warm weather. Berries
and Currants were in free supply and -easy for
the general 'run of offerings. A few chests of
fancy Raspberries from Hay ward." sold at $0
per chest and strictly fancy Blackberries gold
In a small way at $4.
The Orange market was well supplied with
old stock that was being repacked and was
gradually cleaning up. Lemons wsrÂ« offering
freely and.wer* very dull, and prices -of fancy
stock had a sharp decline. Prices' of GrapÂ«
Fruit" are largely nominal, there being very
little good stock on the market. Â¦ -. '

tinued to tend downward. Rtrlns and Wax

O'Brien drew first blood. He cut Carter
over 'the eye in the first round and later
started his nose bleeding. The Fhiladel
phian received most of Carter's blows on
the body. The Brooklyn man put up a
vicious fight, but the Philadelphia boxer
was able to avoid Carter's onslaughts by
clever footwork. O'Brien managed > to
dodge nearly a dozen blows any one of
which would probably have ended tho
fight.

GERMAN EMPEROR'S METEOR
NEWPORT. R. I., 'July 1.â The three
cup yachts ; raced again to-day over a
thirty-mile^ windward and leeward course.
Once more the Reliance demonstrated her
superiority over the Constitution and the
Columbia. The 1903 boat^ defeated the
Constitution. The latter was beaten 19
seconds by Mr. Belmont's craft, but is an
easy winner over her on time allowance.
The time of three hours four minutes
and twenty-seven seconds made by the
Reliance betters the new cup course rec
ord of three hours nine minutes and fifty
three seconds made on Monday by the
new boat. \ The Constitution came within
four seconds of the time made Monday.
The. old ' defender was but twenty-three
seconds behind it.
Not only was the beat to windward
made in remarkably fast time by all tho
contestants, but on the run home, with
spinnakers and ballooners pulling like
mad, the three sloops fairly flew. The Re
liance again excelled the Constitution at
this kind of sailing, covering the fifteen
miles in one hour eleven minutes and four
seconds, better ' sneed than most steam
boats can make.. The Constitution outran
the Columbia very little.
Three employes of the postoffice at Mo
bile have been removed. B. B. Cox and
James T. Peterson weje charged with col
lecting money from other employes for
political purposes, of improperly hand
ling civil service examination papers and
of false statements before postofflce in
spectors. The third man removed was
George B. Crane, the specific charge
against him being the giving of false; tes
timony before the inspectors. . . '
Additional clerks and promotions be
came effective to-day in practically, all
of the first and second class postoffices in
the country, the highest two of the Presi-!
dential grades. The additional, clerks' al
lowed aggregate approximately 3000. and
the promotions of clerks already employed
make an aggregate increase of more than
$1,000,000 in the salary rolls. Exactly .SM
new rural free delivery routes were put
into operation to-day, the first since the
establishment of new routes was suspend
ed In view of the deficit on that account
for the fiscal year just closed. They bring
the total number of routes in^ operation
to approximately 16.000.

Hallenback. Herman said, offered him.
if he wou!d withdraw his bid, WO a week
and a'large part of, 25 per cent of the net
profits of his business, which he would
guarantee to be at least 53000 a year, in
addition to his salary. He said -Sir.
Tooker of the Metropolitan Printing Com
pany offered to pay him $5000 if he would
agree to execute the contract on that
establishment and let them share in the
contract and to make a contract for five
years to pay him $100 per week salary.
These propositions were rejected.
Postmaster General Payne to-day
awarded the contract for printing the
money order blanks of the Government to
Paul Herman of P.utherford, N. J. Her
man was the lowest of fourteen bidders,
and the award of the contract, which In
volves the payment of between $300,000
and J350.000 during the next fiscal year,
will effect a saving of nearly $45,000 tn the
four years' contract. Herman's bid was
opposed by the present contractors, the
Wynkoop-Hallcnback-Crawford Company
of New York, and by the United Typo
thetae of America. Superintendent Met
calf of the Money Order Bureau was dis
missed some days ago on the charge of
indiscretion in seeking the withdrawal of
Herman as a bidder in favor of the pres
ent contractors. At a final hearing be
fore the Postmaster General to-day Her
man furnished an affidavit that he had
been employed by the present contractors
for nearly ten years and had no idea of
competing with them when he l*Â»ft their
employ, which, he said, was. before .the
specifications were taken up. He noade
search for work and says that he- con
cluded he had been practically blacklisted
in the trade and thereupon decided to
start out for himself on a financial back
ing proffered by an Intimate friend. "He
submitted other evidence to show that he
was not a straw bidder, as alleged, and
swore that he has not, directly or Indi
rectly, assigned any interest whatever" In
the contract. He testified that the firm
which objected to his securing the con
tract offered to re-employ him, after the
bids had been opened, at an increased
salary provided he would withdraw his
bid, which offer he rejected. â¢"-.; v. .
REFUSES BRIBES.
WASHINGTON, July 1. â Postmaster
Genoral Payne to-day issued an order
abolishing the position of physician in
postofBces at the close of business on
June 30. 1903. This order wipes out a
small list of officials, whoso employment,
without specific authority of law, has
caused wide discussion in connection
with the postofflce investigation.- Some,
at least, of these offices paid *1700 a year
and were sinecures. One man was car
ried on the rolls of thÂ« Washington post
office for more than a year at that salary
and had practically no duties to perform.
The office finally was abolished and re
cently the Postmaster General held that
the employment of physicians should be
allowed only at offices in cities of 500,000
or more population. The postoffices em
ploying physicians up to the closÂ© of the
fiscal year, which expired last night,
when the proclamation took place, are
New York. Chicago, Brooklyn, Philadel
phia and Boston.

There is reason to. believe that the faH*.
ure to effect the transfer of the Oregon

Lake City has some bearing on the locaV
street railway situation.. It was evidently
planned at the outset to have the transfer
of the traction properties take- place at
about the same time as the Short Line
transfer. Whether or not the- Napoleon?

The fact that the company already has *S
tablished lines at Richmond iff In itself sug
gestive of the possibility of the road from Eu
reka ending near there, if It is decided to be
practicable from an engineering point of view.
The building of this road is an Important un
dertaking and one that necessarily demands
the most careful consideration before work is
inaugurated. The surveys now being . made,
while mainly of a preliminary character, will
in fact be part of the whole survey which we
will be guided by in the construction Â¦ work.
Just when that will begin I am unable to say,
but we will rush matters as fast as possible. .
Clinton Jones, who was for a quarter of
a century local agent of the Hock Island
road, but who resigned his position sev
eral months ago. retired yesterday to pri
vate life. His resignation was to -have
taken effect two months ago, but, on" the
urgent request of the Eastern officials of
the company, he consented to remain un-'
til July 1. C. A. Rutherford of 'Omaha;
who was appointed Jones' successor last
week, is expected here by July 15. . " ;
"At present the only Information I have re
garding the plans of the company is what I
have obtained to-day during a conference with
Captain Payson and Mr. Bissell. As soon as
my forces are organized it Is ray intention to
make a trip over the territory through which
the new road is projected. I know little about
the country over which the road is to extend.
In fact it has not yet been definitely deter
mined Just what the route will be. In. trying
to select a route the surveying parties now in
the field have been confronted with serious
problems, which are hard to overcome. There
arrt three parties making surveys and it is my
Intention to materially Increase this force at
once, in order that I may gain certain im
portant data before fall.
Although it has been generally under
stood that the road would be built direct
ly south to a point somewhere on the
Marin County bay shore line, it Is possi
ble that this plan may b& abandoned and
the southerly connection' made with the
Santa Fe line at Richmond. Upon this
point Engineer Storey said:
W. B. Storey, chief engineer of the
Santa Fe, who Is to superintend the con
struction of- the company's new road
from Eureka to San Francisco Bay, ar
rived from Topeka yesterday. He pur
poses to organize immediately an office
and secure suitable quarters, where the
Important work which he is to undertake
m^y be properly handled by a corps of
competent engineers. In discussing the
project yesterday. Engineer Storey said:
- Contractor Taylor, who was recently
given a contract to do some whitewashing
on the water front, protested vigorously
against paying $10 to a surety company
for a bond. He offered such gilt-edged
sureties as James. Wilson and Hanna. The
Commissioners, while admitting that Wil
son and Hanna were responsible . and ir
reproachable, still insisted that the speci
fications . required the regular surety
bond, a fact which the contractor should
have noted. The contractor lost his pres
ence of mind -and insinuated that the 1
surety requirement was a "graft" in
which the Commissioners were interested
He was rebuked by President Spear and
directed to furnish the bond called fgr by
the specifications. * Â¦
F. J. Cunha of Contra Costa County

F.McGovern, term expired.
It was reported to the board that the
west half of sea wall block No. S had
be.en fenced In. by private parties. . The

concerning the. rights of the State. In the
premises.
The wages of the belt railroad employes
were advanced to conform *o the schedule
of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe.
The Increase Is 10 per cent, on the eight
hour basis.
D. J. Walker, on behalf of the Santa Fe
Railroad, signified to the board that the
company would â¢ consider the proposition
of making repairs to the Main street
apron if the Commissioners would make
some reduction on the monthly charge of
$1200 laid against the company for the use
of Main street wha:f and approaches
thereto. The subject was referred to the
committee. The secretary was Instructed
to arrange the data to show at a glance
the total amount paid by the State during
the last year for repairs to the apron.
Â« The Chief Engineer informed the com
mission that the cement required for slip
A would cost less than $3000, hence It
would not be necessary to advertise for
proposals. Informal bids will be Invited.
The subject of new insurance was con
sidered and referred to the Chief En
gineer. It was suggested that $25,000 be
placed In the new drydock; J4000 on the
Oceanic Steamship office and $15,000 on
the shed of Broadway No. 1.
MUST GIVE SUBETY BOND.
The contract for building the wharf was
awarded to the lowest bidder, the City
Street Improvement Company, for $13,697.
The contract for building. the shed was
awarded to Fred Muller for $4533. These
two proposals amount in the aggregate to
$18,230, the sum tendered for the lease of
the wharf,' exclusive of dockage and tolls.
'The Pacific Coast Steamship "Company
was permitted to withdraw Its own low
bid- of $3818 50 for constructing the shed.
In regular form the bid was rejected and
the contract given to Fred Muller. the
next lowest bidder.. The difference be
tween the two bids is embraced in the
steamship company's tender of $18,230 for
the use of the premises.
NEW INSURANCE.
The Board of State Harbor Commis
sioners met yesterday and awarded to the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company a lease
for 144 months of 200 feet outer
extension of Broadway wharf No. 2. The
company's certified check for $18,230'given
in consideration of the lease was ordered
cashed and the amount paid into the har
bor improvement fund. The Pacific Coast
Steamship Company was the only bidder
for the lease.
Beginning next week the" executive com
mittee will report for publication the list
of Individual contributors . to . the fund.
Letters and telegrams at headquarters in
dicate that a legion of Eastern people will
avail themselves of the reduced -railway
fare and visit San Francisco next month.
The executive committee, Thirty-seventh
National Encampment of the Grand Army
of the Republic, met last night and for
two hours discussed tne plans of street
decoration and Illumination. Horace "Wil
son, chairman of the subcommittee,
strongly favored the -acceptance of the
Hendy bid of $21,565 for the grand arch
designed by W. R- Hewitt. There were
several other bids. One from the Stand-'
ard Electrical Company was lower than
the Hendy proposal, but it did not con
tain a check to guarantee faithful per
formance of contract. .V, , :
In discussing the question of Illumina
tion and decoration the committee took
into consideration the amount of money,
already contribtued to the fund and the
amount of probable future contributions.
Every veteran speaking to the subject
paid tribute to the beauty and grandeur
of the Hewitt design, but when it was
considered that street illumination from
Second to Tenth street on Market and
day decorations over the same area would;
bring the total expense, exclusive of the
city contribution of poles, vo $23,000, mem
bers were compelled to ask for a, reduc
tion of the estimates. As time is an im
portant element in all calculations re
specting the grand arch. It was decided
that the executive and finance committees
should meet again this evening. It was
resolved on motion of E. S. Salomon that
George Stone, chairman of the general
committee, and Horace Wilson, chairman
of the â¢ sub-committee, should confer to
day with J. S. Hendy to ascertain if the
grand arch scheme of itself could be car
ried out and the current supplied for the
sum of $20,000. If money comes in later on
to justify .further disbursement. Market
street, for several- blocks on either, side
of the arch, may be illuminated.
Theodore B. Ross, financial secretary,
submitted a statement of collections and
subscriptions, which give encouragement
to. members of the committee who favor
the execution of elaborate plans or Illumi
nation. In view of this forecast the com
mittee decided to reject a motion; limit
ing the cost of decoration and illumina
tion to $15,000. - . . -
i To avail himself of Â¦ the provisions of
the new' act McComb must be appointed
Jus,tice'q clerk In accordance with its pro
visions. :
; For these reasons the petition fails to state
grounds sufficient to authorize the Issuance of
Â¦a writ, of mandate; and it is ordered the de
murrer be sustained. â¢â¢-..;â¢
Waiving the question of the constitutionality
of the act of 1903 I think the plaintiff cannot
avail himself of the provisions for the reason
h> does not allege an appointment under It.
The said act does not purport to amend- the
sections of the Code of Civil Procedure under
which the plaintiff was appointed, nor In any
way to alter them. There is nothing In the lan
guage to indicate that its intent was to in
crease the salary cf the Justice's clerk already
holding office, or to make any other change in
the provisions of law regulating such clerk. On
Its face the new act creates an office. If such
office was intended to take the place of the
Office formerly provided for by the Code, of
Civil Procedure, the result would be that the
office to which the plaintiff was appointed in
March, J0U2, was abolished J>y the act of 1903
Under the provisions of the latter act, repeal
ing all acts inconsistent with it, and with such
abolition .of the office, the plaintiff's right to
any salary would necessarily fall. If, on the
other hand, the new act creates an office, sepa
rate and distinct from that which existed un
der the- Code of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff is
not. entitled to the emoluments of the new
Office,- not having been appointed to it.
Judge Sloss handed down yesterday a
decision in the case of George S. Mc-
Comb, clerk of the Justice's Court,
against Harry Baehr, Auditor of the city
and County of San Francisco, sustaining
the demurrer filed by the Auditor's attor
ney t It appears that the last Legislature
passed an act Increasing McComb's eal
ary from $2400 to $3000 a year. McComb
attempted to collect the latter sum last
month, but Auditor Baehr declined to
pay it to him, upon the ground that he
had not been appointed under the new
act. McComb thereupon petitioned for a
writ of mandate to compel the Auditor to
recognize his demand. The Auditor's at
torney filed a demurrer to the petition
and- in sustaining it Judge Sloss says:
â¢ Plaintiff alleys that on March 24, 1903 he
was appointed Justice's clerk of the City and
County of San Francisco, pursuant to the pro
visions of section SÂ« of the Code" of Civil Pro
cedure. Section 97 of this code in force at the
time of the plaintiffs appointment fixes the
salary of the Justice's clerk at $2400 per year
Ah act of the Lezislature. approved March 2o|
1&03, fixes such salary at $3000 per year. The
purpose of the present proceeding is to com
pel the Auditor of the City and County of San
Francisco to allow the demand of the plaintiff
for ealary for the month of May at the rate
fixed by the act of 1903. The. act of 15KH re
peals all other acts, so far as they conflict
with it. The plaintiff contends that he is en
titled to receive the salary fixed by the new
set.

ETROIT. Mich.. July 1.â The Sab
bath question, one of the most
Important matters now before
the Jewish people, was taken up
at to-day's session of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis. Rabbi J.
Voorsanger of San Francisco, chairman
of the Sabbath committee, appointed at
the last meeting to consider all phases
of the Jewish Sabbath and the question
of changing it from Sabbath to Sunday
presented the report of the committee.
The reading of the report was attended
with scenes that bordered on the sensa
tional at times. Sharp comments, pun
gent criticisms and decided objections fol
lowed the reading of each section and
After' some discussion the report was
referred to a committee of five for fur
ther consideration, the committee to re
port Friday. Â»
I Before the Sabbath question was taken
up Rabbi Philipson presented the report of
the committee on relation between rabbi
and congregation.
The commission also reported that, while
historically they could not find any argu
ment to declare a change from Sabbath
to Sunday schismatic, they would pre
fer to relegate so important a question
to any future authority properly consti
tuted to decide It. Immediately after the
report was read the rabbis went into ex
ecutive session to consider it and an
nounced that at its close they would issue
a statement on the deliberations.
several times Dr." Voorsanger was Inter
rupted by the ; critics, of the report. The
committee, after â¢ a most careful consid
eration, decided, that- it had no Jurisdic
tion to recommend anything in the nature
of legislation. looking toward any change
and declared that the conference was in
competent to : legislate any fundamental
Jewish institution out of existence, ii
The commission reported that a .'defini
tion of the religious authority that should
regulate the authority and discipline of
the Jews was . paramount: to any , other
question. They., recommended' the crea
tion of a national conference, composed of
rabbis Â¦ and laymen, constituting an au
thority to which all rituaP and discipline
questions might be referred. This plan is
in effect a scheme to consolidate the Con
ference of American i Rabbis and the
Union of Hebrew Congregations for the
purpose of creating an organic union be
tween both bodies.
