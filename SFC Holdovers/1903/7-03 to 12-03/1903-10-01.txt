counter between the police and striking
car men took place here to-day. Revol
vers.were used on both sides and many
persons were. wounded, . several "mortally.

The. remarks of- the. Austrian Premier
which has most Irritated the Hungarians
consisted of his statement in the Reichs
rath .that . Austria was prepared to go
to war . in defense of Emperor Francis
Joseph's declaration against the demand
that the Hungarian language be used In
orders given to soldiers ,7 the Hungarian
contingent Â¦ of the Austro-Hungarlan

- Francis Kossuth, the opposition leader,
is in favor of a peaceful policy, but Herr
Barabas, who heads the majority of Kos
suth's'followers, is inclined to push the
agitation to extremes.
The . House ultimately adjourned pend
ing the formation of a new Cabinet. Herr
Kublnyi, Ministerialist, declared, in be
half of the Liberals, that they would sup
port no- Cabinet which refused. to repel
the attitude of Dr.' von Koerber, "whose
remarks violated the rights of Hungary."
Francis* Kossuth, after expressing sur
prise, at the fact that the Ministry should
have "struck,", said he hoped a Premier
would be . appointed who would vigor
ously contest the interference in Hun
garian matters of Dr. von Koerber, the
Austrian Premier.
Hedervary asked the House
to adjourn pending , the constitution of
a new Government. . Immediately, after
ward Count* Hedervary, with the other
Ministers, left the House. The President,
however, ruled that, the resignation of
the Cabinet was not sufficient ground for
an adjournment and, invited the House to
continue its ' work.

NACO. Ariz., Sept. 30.â J. W. Dooley
was knocked on the head and robbed by
highwaymen aÂ£ Naco on Tuesday night
and then carried to the railroad tracks
near by. The murderous thugs left him'
lying in an unconscious condition across
the rails, expecting him to be killed by a
train and his remains mutilated, thus con
cealing their crime.
Dooley was struck by the first train
which passed and dragged 100 feet, but
miraculously escaped twing killed. He
was picked up by the train crew and car
ried into Blsbee, where he was placed in
the- hospital. One arm and Â«. leg had to
be amputated and he is Injured internally.
At last accounts he tvas reported to bÂ«
dying, but had recovered consciousness
long enough to tell his story.
Dooley owns a small ranch at Lowell,
near Bisbee, and had gone to Naco for a
good time. After winning a sum of mon
ey, which as far as he remembers was
about $350.' he left the gambling hall to
find a stopping place for tha night and
was followed by two of the murderous
thugs of the border, who hit him on the
head and took his money while he lay un
conscious. He does not remember any
thing after being struck on the head ex
cept that while lying on the rails he re
covered consciousness for a few minutes
and long enough to realize his horrible
position, for he was unable to move. HÂ»
must have lain on the rails six hours be
fore the train which struck him came
along and picked him up% *

NEW ORLEANS, Sept. ' SO.â According
to information received in this city a plan
to invade San Salvador has bften under
consideration for some time by President
Manuel E"stra'da Cabrera of Guatemala,
who in pursuit of this ideai endeavored to
enlist tfee* aid" of the Hondureart Govern
ment in.war. ' Honduras lies on. the south
and east of San Salvador and Guatemala
T?n. the * : north, and an expedition from
each of these countries wpuld c.atch San
Salvador between two fires and plaoe the
rep'ubiic in an interesting predicament. ,
â¢ According to the plans it waa Intended
that Guatemala was to have moved on
San Salvador at the close of the rainy
season, which would havejmade the date
for the! move # eome , time this nionth.
However, the* contemplated combine with
Honduras appears to have* fallen through
owing j to the refusal of the President of
that republic to join hands with Guate
mala in the attempt. The project Has by
no means been abandoned by : President
Cabrera of Guatemala, and consequently
news of an expedition is momentarily ex
pected.
San Salvador is more closely eonnected
with Guatemala than any other Central
American country, and is most easily
reached by troops, thus making it the
natural objective point for expeditions
from that country. Honduras is sepa
rated from Guatemala by a range of
mountains, which would render the trans
port df soldiers" a matter ' attended by
much difficulty, but in the case of .' San
Salvador only a tableland about thirty
miles in width separates the two' coun
tries. It is .possible to travel in a day on
horseback from the capital of Guatemala*
into , Salvadorian territory, and there
would be no trouble attendant upon the
entrance of an army into the latter re
public. ,
President Cabrera of Guatemala * has
from. time to time massed troops. on the
frontier, of Â¦ the â¢ two t countries. At one
time,, it is understood, he had 14,000 troops
camped on, the frontier, and; at the-pres
ent moment it Is estimated that there are
from ; 6000 to 7000 soldiers located at va
rious points.
The. reasons for the contemplated inva
sion "of San Salvador are numerous and
largely concern- the internal affairs of
Guatemala. The incumbent of the Presi
dency; is one) of the most unpopular ' of
Central American Presidents.

port nearest the Abyssinian frontier. We
expect to have a g^iard of marines from
one of the warships of the European fleet
and it will be necessary to employ many
natives to care for the pack animals. The
expedition will be organized at Harrar.
"I am earning, on a silver platter, as
it were, an invitation for King Menelik

Sir Michael had been at Davos-Platz
about five weeks. When he returned to
London 'from- America he confessed that
he felt far from well, but hla physicians
still held hooes. of his conquering the con
sumption. The Embassador. expected to
leave Davos-Platz a week or so ago, in
'order to greetthe Alaskan commissioners
here, but he contracted bronchitis. Of
this he wrote only a few days ago quite
slightingly, saving' it was only ' annoying

SIR MICHAEI/S ILLNESS.
Solicitor General Carson followed and
the commission quietly broke up until
to-morrow.
Â¦ Friends of Sir Michael Herbert came
hurrying along the . Foreign Office corri
dors to ascertain if the news were true.
On all \ sidesâ American, Canadian . and
Englishâ genuine sorrow was exhibited,
which was evidently actuated by a sense
of deep personal loss.
In the meanwhile Embassador Choate
had ' entered. He had Just come from Lord
Lansdowne's room, where he haU learned

.. The intense silence which followed the
delivery of Lord Alverstone's tribute was
broken by Jacob M. Dickinson of Ameri

sorrow and. proposed an adjournment of
the commission. Â¦;.-Â¦-
A second later the counsel, â¢ secretaries
and spectators sat spellbound as Lord Al

coursing down his. cheeks, announced that
Sir Michael Herbert was dead. Maps and

cannot trust my self- to express the feelins of

Tho Czar in replying said that the Em
peror's words of welcome had touched
him deeply. He had accepted the invita
tion with exceptional pleasure and was
happy to be able to express his personal
feelings. The cordial understanding be
tween Russia and Austria and the com
plete harmony In the action of their gov
ernments constituted a' valuable pledge
for the success . of the great work of
pacification on which they were mutually
agreed.. The,- humanitarian aim pursued,
continued tbe Czar, 'excluded all partial
ity and must be attained with . firmness
and perseverance by methods which were
most fitted to insure a real and perma
nent pacification. He hoped, he said, that
these efforts would contribute', to the
strengthening of general peace.
After luncheon the Emperors, accom
panied by Grand Duke Francis Ferdinand
and a number of guests; drove to the sta
tion near Vienna, where they took a train
for Muersteg on a hunting expedition. In
the course of which, it is expected, the
Balkan situation will be discussed.
? The Emperor's reception,- however, was
respectful if not as enthusiastic as might
have been expected. The thoroughfares
through which the Czar and Emperor
Francis Joseph drove on their .way. from
the station to Schoenbrunn Castle were
effectively decorated, but the city proper
showed almost no evidence of welcome.
This may be accounted for by the fact
that the royal procession did not touch
the main section of Vienna.
The Czar on his arrival Eeemed tired,
and on the way to; Schoenbrunn Castle
gave little evidence of Interest In the ar
rangements for his reception. The police
precautions were extraordinary. Almost
half the Vienna force was concentrated
along the route from the station, where a
great number of detectives were gathered.
At the state luncheon Emperor Francis
Joseph proposed the health . of the Czar
and expressed his pleasure at welcoming
him. He said that the acceptance of the
invitation was a fresh proof of the friend
ship, which he (Emperor Francis Joseph)
highly esteemed. The cordiality of their
personal relations had already repeatedly
exercised a beneficial influence on the po
litical relations between the two countries,
and he hoped, continued the Emperor,
that their perfect accord of views arid
considerations regarding the regrettable
occurrences in the . Balkan peninsula
would again contribute to the success of
tho action the two countries were jointly
taking there in the interest of European
peace.
VIENNA, Sept." 30.â The arrival of the
Czar here to-day was not marked by the
same popular enthusiasm as was shown
during the visits of King Edward and'Em
peror William. This was probably due to
the "military and police precautions, . as
both sides of the streets were lined with
Infantry, cavalry and artillery, and be
hind the hedge, of soldiers was a thick
line of police facing the populace.

"WASHINGTON". Sept. 30.â Ellis H.
Roberts. Treasurer of the United States, i
has submitted his report to Secretary
Shaw on the condition of the treasury 'â¢
on June 9. 1903, and its operations dur- .
ing the fiscal year. The total net rev-?
enues for the year were $560,396,673, an
increase of J3S.JÂ»3S.43O over the year pre
ceding, and the total expenditures $506,
099.007. an increase of $35,731,034. Tho
surplus was J54,'2D7.667. as compared
with |91. 287,375 in 1902. In the receipts
there was an increase of more than $30,
000,000 from customs and a falling off
of over 1 11.000,000 from internal rev
enue, the latter being the result of legis
lation enacted with that object.
On the side of expenditures there was
an increase in every important account
except pensions and interest in which
there were slight savings. The expendl- 1
tures for the two military departments,
which together amounted to $191,227.
554, forming by far the heaviest outlay
for. any single purpose, were more than
$21,000,000 greater than the year before. :
The aggregate income, including, besides
the revenues, the receipts from bonds,
notes and coin certificates, was $1,211,
394,097, and the aggregate outgo $1,122.
647.665. - At the close of the year the
treasury held $893,063,869 of gold and
silver on deposit against outstanding
certificates and treasury notes, besides
the $150,000,000 in gold which forms the
reserve against United States notes.
Treasurer Roberts places the monetary
stock of the country on June 30, 1903.
including gold and silver. United States
notes, treasury notes and national bank
notes, but not certificates, at $2,683,149.
621. an increase of $124.S32,963 for the
year. The increase in gold was $60,137.
401. and in national banknotes $58,
99S.559.
Tho total estimated stock of gold was
$1,252,781,990. constituting nearly 47 per
cent of the whole. The gold m the treas
ury amounted to $631,420,789. after a
gain of $71,220,430 in twelve months.
During the year $126,715,723 in gold was
deposited at the mints and assay offices.
Of the receipts from customs at the port
of New York, constituting 67 per cent
Of the whole, 8 S per cent were in golJ.
The proportion of gold at other ports It
about 80 per cent. The Imports of k,t
were $44,082,092 and the exports $17,
090,595. The increase of the money i
circulation during the year was $121.
740,252. of which $59,776,462 was in go!
certificates and $54,520,193 in nation*
bank notes. The share of money foi
each person increased 89 cents and th<
proportion of gold to the whole rose t
42 per cent, the highest ratio ever re-'
corded.
There has been a continued increase
In the proportions of paper currency of
the denominations of $1Â© and under in
circulation, but the growth hardly keeps
pace with the demand. TTia supply can
be Increased if Congress will authorize
the issue of gold certificate- for $10 and
remove the restriction on the issue of $5
notes by national banks. To meet the
constant pressure requires strenuous eX
fort in the preparation of the currency
Issue. The national bank notes pre
sented for redemption during the year
amounted to $196,429,621. or 51 per cent
of the average outstanding. Of the $5
notes the redemptions were 55 per cent,
of the 10's 46 per cent, of the 20's 49
per cent, of the 50's 61 per cent and of
the 100's 73 per cent. These figures
show that the tens and twenties remain
in circulation longest.

If you want a fighter to lead I am with you
In the coming campaign. (Oreat cheering and

fight, because you men are coming atcund me.
When I speak to you as members of this con

name a Board of Supervisors, eighteen men
who would for decent things, who would
bÂ« loyal to the city, who could not bÂ« bought,
and whose Integrity would be beyond question.
You have named such a board. (Applause.)
Those men and the Mayor of San Francisco

So far as the trade is concerned, whole
salers are compelled to replenish their
stock on almost any terms demanded. In
one of the London hospitals devoted to
the treatment of pulmonary diseases the
use of cod liver oil has been abandoned
and petroleum emulsions substituted,
with satisfactory results.â London Times.
! The failure of the cod liver oil crop for
two years has caused the Norwegian Gov
ernment so much concern that official bul
letins have been Issued about it. The
failure ls not altogether in the supply of
cod, for about the same number are taken
from, the sea each year, but the cod that
are caught lack nutriment. Most of them
are half starved and do not weigh one
third as much as they should. Some of
them are so thin that the livers (from
which the oil is taken) are barely dis
tinguishable.
The coldness of the sea has killed the
smaller fish on which the cod subsist.
Cod, as well as seals, have been living on
short rations for a long time. Hundreds
of cod caught with lines are found to
have been bitten by hungry seals. . A bul
letin recently issued by* the Norwegian
Government says:
"The condition of codfish is worse than
ever. They have no livers to speak of.
It ls now requiring 40,000 fish to make a
barrel of oil. This is without parallel In
the history of our fisheries."- ' *

SALEM. Or.. Sept. 30.â B. C. Parsons,
for the past three years a trusted em
ploye of the Insane asylum, was yester
day suspended from duty pending an In
vestigation. Parsons' wife yesterday filed
a divorce suit and in her complaint alleged
that her husband had stolen blankets
and other supplies from the asylum and
concealed them In their house. When the
papers were filed the asylum authorities
searched the Parsons home and found
the stolen goods. Parsons denied his
guilt, but the blankets showed that the
asylum mark had been clumsily removed.
The divorce suit ls responsible for
bringing 1 the theft to light and a. thorough
investigation may lead to further develop
ments at the asylum. Parsons ls well
connected here. As his wife is believed
to have known that the goods were stolen
at the time the thefts occurred It may
develop that she will be held as accessory.

aYid the average payment is about $2 a
week to each person. The figures given
by the Government show, that the amount
of the pensions is slowly creeping up on
the income of the company, despite the
fact that the income is also on the rise.
Thus far no attention has apparently
been paid In the workings of the scheme
to the, fact that a certain amount of
money should be Invested and held In
reserve to pay the annuities already on
the books.
The British critics of the plan, mainly
rival merchants, argue that if the 5000
widows are really pensioners on the books
the firm has a liability to them in the
future of. not less than $10,000,000. Lately,
to extend the . business still further, it
has been announced that any ( woman al
ready a widow may "earn a lifelong pen
sion ..by purchasing, a. half pound of tea
weekly for ten consecutive years. This
pension amounts to 10 shillings a week.
The boom , that follows this new depar
ture ls expected. to hold up the company's
end for some time on the old plan, but
the mathematicians of the Industrial in
surance companies which have , been de
prived of their weekly premiums by the
insurance "with a little tea\ In it" plan
and the tea merchants who have been de
prived of : their; trade, both say that the
time of failure of the scheme is not' far
off for. tho. tea; company.': \
A curious situation has arisen in London
over the advertising scheme adopted by a
tea store. The plan was this: Any mar
ried woman who bought tea in any quan
tity, however small, from the firm regu
larly every week for flf ty-two consecu
tive weeks, became entitled. If her hus
band died after that time, to a life-long
pension. The pension, of course, was
small. ,
The idea took, and the business of the
company leaped up to an astonishing fig
ure. For the first two or three years the
outlay for pensions was almost nothing
compared with the income. Of courso the
number of widows increased gradually,
but for some time In no noticeable dis
proportion to the new volume of business.
The scheme did not very clearly come un
der the supervision, of the Government
insurance officials and the company had
merely to report the status of its business
and the amount of pensions paid. The
annual Insurance blue book of Great
Britain -contains . this year for the first
time tl printed statement of this plan.

Other important questions affecting legisla
tion were taken up. and on behalf of the In
ternational Bookbinders' Union the Miller case
was discussed. The executive" council brought
to the President's attention the manner in
which his decision had been quoted, and in ad
dition to the relationship of Mr. Miller to the
Bookbinders' Union Â» as brought forth in the
charges against him. the "open . shop" Idea
was Â¦ carefully considered. Replying to state
ments on the subject President Roosevelt set
forth that in his decision he had nothing In
mind but a strict compliance with the Federal
etatutes, including the civil service law, and
that he recognized the difference between em
ployment by the Government circumscribed by
these laws and any other form of employment,
and that his decision in the Miller case should
not be understood to have any other effect
or Influence than affecting direct employment
by the Government In accordance therewith.
He furthermore made plain that In any form
of employment excepting that bo circumscribed
he believed the full employment of union men
was preferable either to non-union or "open
shops." " _
Because of the wonderful Improvements m
the methods of wealth production, by which
the needs of men and the luxuries of life can
be- created In a work day of eight hours, we
demand enforcement of the eight-hour day, not
only In private employment, but also on all
work performed by or on behalf of the Gov
ernment, whether the employment be directed
by contract or sub-contract.
While we seek to avoid and avert strikes and
industrial disputes, any attempt to cripple the
right of labor as a last resort to strike In de
fense of our rights simply means labor's en
slavement; for industrial tranquillity by agree

fair arbitration ls only possible and attainable
when the workers are organized and have the
liberty to exercise their constitutional rights.

The conference with the President con
cerning desired legislation and the Miller
controversy is treated 33 follows:
In connection with -the meeting of the ex
ecutive council, and by appointment, a con
ference was held -with the President of the
United States for the purpose of discussing
labor legislation. The eight-hour bill was con
sidered at length, the President stating that
hla mind had not changed on that form of leg
islation since he had favored it as Governor
of New York State, and therefore he was fa
vorable to the passage of the proposed act.
On the antl-lnjunctlon bill. In response to
questions submitted, the President replied that
the subject would have his most careful and
earnest attention.

The letter of resignation of Lord George
KamlHon, the late Secretary of State for
India, was also published to-night, accom.
panled by a letter to the chairman of the
Conservative Council of Ealing, which
borough ho represented in Parliament. In
which Lord George says that he wrote
*!s resignation on the afternoon of Sep
tember 15 in ignorance of Chamberlain's
resignation and the consequent elimina
tion of everything relating^ to preferential
tariffs from the Government programme,
thÂ© first Intimation of which reached him
through the morning paper? of September
IK which also contained the announce
ment from the London Gazette of the ac
ceptance of his own resignation.
The lettor of resignation defines Lord
George Hamilton's views, and says that
anything: tending to raise the price of
production in Great Britain is injurious
to trade, and the interference with or re
versal of the policy of free imports must
operate in that direction. He fails to see
how recourse to protection or retaliation
can be of advantage to the general 1m.
port trade, and says he cannot be a party
to the reversal of the principles of Great
Britain's fiscal policy. He believes that
the system of preferential trade within
the empire and retaliation outside will
be detrimental to the commerce and in- :
dustry of India,
Lord George Hamilton expresses the be
lief that the gTeatrst danger to British
industries are the economical and scien
tific methods of production which their
foreign rivals are introducing into the
manufacture of articles in which Great
Britain was formerly superior. He points
out that the country has borne with sur
prising ease the heavy load of taxation
necessitated by the South African war,
End has emerge from that ordeal with
unimpaired credit.
The Midlothian (Scotland) Liberal Asso
ciation has adopted Lord DalmÂ«?riy. eldest
eon of tlie Earl of Rosebery, as its can

election. Lord Dalmeny, in his addresa |
accepting the nomination, said he was !

Jain's preferential trade proposals.

daughter: "While walking along the street
one day the child, who had (he happy
faculty of looking on the sunny sidu of
things, saw a wagonload of sheepskins.
"What are those things, papa?" shÂ«
asked. "Sheepskins, my dear." "But
where are the sheep, papa?" The father
explained that the sheep had been killed
for food. Looking after thÂ« wagon, with
the tails of the sheepskins wagging as
they dangled over the side, the child re
marked: "Well, papa, the sheep may be
dead, but the tails seem to be having a
good time."
The little home on the morning after her
death was besieged with visitors, both
white and colored, all of whom knew thÂ«
old soul during the later years^of her life,
and who had taken much Interest In her

A curious relic of the Baldwln-ZIegler
polar expedition, which returned last Au
gust, haa been received by the American
Consul at Bergen, Norway. It is a mes
sage from Mr. Baldwin, dated June 11,
1902, from Camp Zlegler, Franz Josef
Land, asking for more coal, hay, fried
fish and sledges.
This message, neatly written on a small
piece of parchment, was Inclosed In a cop
per tube, which was inserted In a large
cork, shaped like a top, -with a copper peg,
which made it float like a miniature buoy.
The cork top was picked up at Vopua
fjord, Iceland, by a farmer, who handed
It to a merchant, and the latter, carrying
out the instructions conveyed in the mes
sage, forwarded it, under date May 20,
19G3, to E. S. Cunningham, the United
States Consul at Bergen.â Public Ledger.

Gossip has already bejjun over the meet
ing of Fltz?immons and Gardner the
trickiest fighters in the business. A ques
tion has been raised as to Fitzsimmons*
ability to make 168 pounds. On the day
after he arrived here from Chicago be
fore the Jeffries-Corbett fight he weighed
200 pounds. He wore a silk hat and frock
cult. Allowing fifteen pounds for the
Â¦weight of his clothes, it would still leave
him seventeen pounds to take off. It is
not supposed for a nr.oment that a man
so crafty aa Fitzsimmons would bind him
self to make a weight lower than he could
do. He worked on Gardner to sign "win
ner take all." but the Lowell man would
not asrree to this. They finally settled
upon 75 and 25 per cent.
Eddie Hanlon was about town yester

Efter his sensational fight with Yanger

The amount of punishment Hanlon has
takm in his important rights must in
evitably tcrÂ«d to make his career in the
ring a short and a bri'liant one. It was
the consensus of opinion yestrrflay that
the man who whips Hanlon must devote
all his attention to his head. He has a
perfect defense for the body and few
blows get beyond his arms or his elbows.
It is expected his next opponent will
be Young; Corbett. While the latter had
money he would not talk fight. Having

of thair studies they should return to

the Judge, who comes here as a student

Among the bankers i and financial men of
the city no man was better known than
was "Chris" Curtis. In the early 'SO's he
was the friend and business confidant of
Senator Stanford. Flood and other capi
talists of the time. Everybody who had
dealings with the banking concern with
which he was connected knew Curtis even
better than the higher officers of the
house, and on . the street he was a fa
miliar figure among the stock brokers and
moneyed men. Dressed in his uniform of
vault clerk, Curtis was seen daily in the
company of men who can sign their check
for a sum up in the six figures.
Curtis was born in Brunswick, Me., in
1S52, the son of John Curtis, a famous sea
captain of the New England coast. At an
early age he went in his father's ship to
France and there received his early edu
cation. Quitting school at the age of 16
years, young Curtis traveled extensively
in his father's ships until he reached
young manhood, when he found himself
in San Francisco. Being temporarily em
barrassed, Curtis obtained employment as
a postoffiee mail carrier until he entered
the service of the California Safe Deposit
and Trust Company, in 1S80. The position
of vault clerk he obtained at that time
he filled without any break until his
death.
Besides his reputation in financial cir
cles Curtis was a prominent figuro in fra
ternal lodges. He was a member of King
Solomon Lodge of the Free and Accepted
Masons of this city, a member of the Na
tional Union and also a conspicuous fig
ure in Fidelity Lodge, Ancient Order
United Workmen. The local lodge of Ma
sons of which Curtis was a member will
conduct the funeral services from Masonic
Temple on Friday.
Curtis leaves a wife, residing at the
family home, 1516 Masonic avenue, besides
Fix childrenâ John, Letitla, Sadie, Mazle,

EAELIEST KNOWN USE
OF FORKS FOR EATING
They Were ' Not Very Common in
England : Before the year
1815.
It seems strange that the use of forks
began only with our easily remembered
forefathers; that the Greeks and Romans
did not know anything about them, and
that In the Far Eastern countries their
use is still unknown. Up to the fifteenth
century they were known only in Italy.
Elizabeth had three "forks garnished
with gold slelghtly," and with "lyttle
perles pendant," but they were consider**
as curiosities and never used. Indeed, in
that era it was considered bad form, and
ministers contended that to use them was
an insult to God. What were our fingers
for? In Thomas Coryates'. "Crudites,"
published originally in 1608, is this:
"I observed a custom in all those Ital
ian cities and towns through which I
passed that is not used in any other coun
try that I saw in my travels; neither do I
think that any other nation- in Christen
dom doth use it but in Italy. The Italian,
and also most strangers,, do always at
their meals use a little forke when 'they
cut their meats. For while with their
knife, which they do . hold In one. hand,
they cut the meate out of. the dish, they
fasten the forke, which they hold in the
other hand, upon the same dish; so what
soever he be that, sitting in the company
of others at meals, j should inadvisedly
touch the dish of meats with his fingers,
from which all the table do cut, he will
give occasion of offense to all the com
pany, "as having ' transgressed the laws
of good manners, in so much that for his
error he shall be at the least browbeaten,
If not reprehended in wordes. This form
of breeding, I understand, generally used
in all places of Italy, their . forkes being
for the most part made of iron, steele and
Bome of sHver; but these are used only
by gentlemen. The reason for this curi
osity is because the Italian cannot by any
means lndure to have his meate touched
with fingers, seeing that all men's fingers
are not alike cleane."
Not until the' middle of the seventeenth
century did England's nobility begin the
use of forks, but they came into use
slowly," and even- In the early; part of the
eighteenth century gentlemen who travel
ed carried a knife and fork, because the
inns were not likely to have them. About
1815 forks. became quite common In Eng
land and In Europe and soon became to
be considered generally as a necessity.â

PLAINTIFF'S CASE CLOSED
IN MADERA LIBEL SUIT
Yesterday Andy Meehan, whose name is
on the deed as a witness, denied that he
ever affixed his signature to any such
document. Several other witnesses were
examined as to their having seen Duffy in
Nome and as to their knowledge of the
steamer on which Duffy left the Arctic
regions in the year In which the alleged
deed was made. They denied point blank
having seen Duffy on the vessel which
the defendants claim he left Nome on.-
Further evidence will be taken in the
case to-day. â¢ . â¢
Duffy's testimony was a flat contradic
tion of the evidence of the miner and the
well-known attorney. He said he never
made any deed and that the signature on
the document shown him was not his sig
nature, t-.'i ~
The supposed deed was made, according
to the evidence so far adduced, In the of
fice of Attorney Metson at Nome. Duffy
was paid $20,000 for his interest, receiving
the money from John Brynteson, one of
L.indeberg's partners. A few days a^o
Brynteaon Identified the deed, when It vrug,
offered In evidence, and testified to hav
ing carried the purchase price of the mine
from the office of the Pioneer Mining
Company to the office of Attorney Met
scn and there paying It over to Duffy in
exchange for the_deed. Attorney Metson
testified in a like* strain and also identi
fied the deed.
The suit Involving valuable mining
property on Anvil Creek, near Nome,
Alaska, which is now on hearing in Judge
Graham's court. Is attracting considerable
Interest because of the mass of evidence
that is being offered, by Campbell, Metson
& Campbell, the attorneys * representing
Jafet Lindeberg, the defendant In the
suit. It all tends to prove that Llndoberg
Is the owner of the disputed property, and
that It was deeded to him by Thomas
Duffy, though the latter, who is the plain
tiff in the action, claims that he never ex
ecuted any deed and that he is entitled to
a share of the gold dust that Llndeberg
and his four associates took out of the
mine, v -
"Twice the crew wanted to mutiny, and
Â¦when thpy were not planning to rebel
epainst the majesty nf the British mari
time laws our' minds were dwelling on
the prospect of the ship going to the bot
tom. I had a delightful time." and Bishop
shuddered as he recalled his twenty-eight
<layÂ« on tfre old ship ard the many expe
riences that developed out of them.
"Not for me," was his emphatic asser
tion when asked last. n5g:ht whether he
was planning another Journey by the wa
ter route.
Young Bishop briefly explained his un
expected return l>y saying- that the cap
tain cf the Gnntock Rock was not long
In realizing that his American apprentice
wÂ«s not of the rinht material to make
a deep sea sailor and readily released his
cabin -bey when the -ship reached the
Bound. In twenty-four hours Bishop was
aboard a train bound for this city and
makin? all kind of resolutions not to
erain venture bej-ond the guard rails of
the harbor wharves.
Then followed a long sick spell, during
tvhich he was confined to his bunk In
the dingy forecastle. Meanwhile his
many. Eyxnpathiztng friends in this _city
vrere speculating as to his whereabouts
en the ma. for the--Oantock Rock Is a
flow going vessel and had made poor pro
gress up the coast. Four weeks passed
and no word was received from Bishop
by his friends, who began to be alarmed
at'the failure of the Oantock to report
afher northern destination. Finally, aft
er* twenty-eight days of uneasiness, the
welcome news came that the ship had
reached the Sound. Still there was .no
message from Bishop and his fate was
Ufe subject of discussion among acquain
tances up to a late hour last evening,
â¢when the joyful tidings flitted over the
local telephone wires that connect the
bachelor Quarters of a number of his
friends that Charley Bishop was again
in- "San Francisco..
Locking much the better for his sea
trip, Bishor> came down from tlie north
<rz. the Orecon express last night and
quietly boardlne a car hastened out to
the borne of his parents, where It Is need-
Jess 'to etate a rejentinp father pladly
wc-lcomed the son back to his fireside.

Chcxles Bishop, son of Ira Bishop, one
cf this city's leading business men, Is
aeain warming his feet at tho . parental
fireside after a month's absence on the
fcigh seas, and If "present signs count for
anything there will be no more mariner's
adventures in the future Itinerary of this
young man. On August 22 young Bish
op after a disagreement with his father,
resultant of his failure to haeten the har
visting of his wild oats, the son appren
ticed himself aboard the British Bhlp
Gr.r.tock Rock as cabin boy, and the fol
lowing day the soggy old vessel, buffeted
about by the high rolling seas, was mak
ing her way slowly northward along the
coast en route to Puget Sound.
The voyage upon which Bishop had em
barked was to terminate at the end of
fourteen months In Liverpool, provided
the vessel was fortunate enough to ; keep
above sea, which many feared was not to
be her fate, and during that long period th6
American apprentice was to faithfully
serve his master, and for that matter,
every one else on board, in the capacity of
assistant to the chip's cook. Two days
at his new taEk furnished Bishop, who
bad been accustomed to all the comforts
that a rich man's Bon can expect, with
enjough experience as a mariner to last
lilm for the balance of his life and started
Trlthin him a strong desire to again tread
the marble floors of the Palace court and
the bituminized pavements of his native
city. As be sadly contemplated his mls
Â«rable lot during his hours off watch in
the forecastle and heard the balance of
the vessel's crew plotting mutiny, Eish
cp's longing- for home grew with the
nauseating feeling that overtook him as
the ship rolled and cre-iked on her north
ward voyage.

with . having robbed . a man and using a
hatchet as a weapon. To the desertion of
his wife, whom he professes to love more
than his own life, he attributes much of
his hardship.
Ilashlm" was in a starving condition yes
terday, .morning when he sent word to
Isaa : M. Cohen of 629 Sixth avenue, who
sells jewelry and does a pawnbroklng'
business. Cohen went to 224- West Thirty
eighth street, where Hashim rents a fur
nished room. No sooner had Hashim
closed the door than he locked It. Cohen
.says, and taking a hatchet from a closet
he" brandished It. over Cohen's head and
threatened to kill Mm unless he gave him
a gold watch and a $300 diamond ring
which belonged to Hashim and which Co
hen had fin his possession. The Jeweler
â¢says he did as he was requested, as he
feared Hashim would kill him. Quickly
opening the" door Hashim ran Into the
street, followed by Cohen, who shouted
for help.~ Hashim started for Broadway,
a "crowd at his heels. At Thirty-sixth
street he turned, and Policeman Rlnn and
George Lawlor, a special policeman,
caught him.
Hashim was born in Egypt and Is high
ly educated. He was married to Maude
Gertrude Rice In San Francisco. For sev
eral years he was Interested in theatrical
ventures with hi3 brothers, Najlb and A.
A. Hashim. At one time they managed
the Academy of Music In Washington,
the Park Theater in Philadelphia and
Koster.& Bial's in this city. Recently
they had the St. Nicholas Rink. Hashim
said he lost $40,000 in four years in his
ventures. Magistrate Pool held him In
$3000 bonds for examination.
Newspaper Artists Claim P. Howard
and Edward Bostwick Collected
Without Authority.
P. Howard, a race track follower, and
Edward P. Bootwick, alias E. J. Hughes,
were arrested last evening by Detectives
Freel and Bunner. Several days ago com
plaint was made to the police by Manager
Leggett of the art exhibition to be given
by the Newspaper Artists' Association of
San Francisco at the "Palace Hotel on Oc
tober 6, that the two men in custody had
been circulating among the leading men
of this city and securing subscriptions for
the purpose of placing pen and Ink
sketches of them at the exhibit. Mr. Leg
gett maintains that they were acting
without authority and he intends to pros
ecute them on charges ot obtaining: monay
on false pretenses.
A circular received from the American
Cartoonist Magazine of Denver, Colo., of
fers a reward of $100 for information that
will convict Howard and Bostwlck. who,
it is claimed, were operating in that city
with the same kind of a swindle.

THE COPPEB INDUSTRY
OF THE UNITED STATES
Production Heavier Last Year Than
in 1901; Also the Con- >
sumption. Â¦ â¢â¢
In his report to the United States Geo
logical Survey on the production of cop
per in 1902, Charles Kirchhoff says that
the coppef mining industry of the United
States suffered during 1902 from the reac
tion which followed the unsuccessful at
tempt during 1901 to maintain the value of
the metal at an artificial level. The col
lapse which came toward the close of 1901
left many producers committed to sales
covering a long perio'd,. at low prices,
with the menace of heavy accumulations
of metal constantly over the market. Yet
production was heavier during 1902-'than it
had been in 1901, because some of the im
portant mines were worked to full capa
city and because some of the., enlarge
ments and improvements previously be
gun became .effective during' the year.
Furthermore, a number of new enter
prises first produced important quantities
of metal. On the other hand, accidents
and. labor troubles cut down the outputs
of some of the larger undertakings. Un
less unforeseen events cause widespread
or prolonged stoppage of -operations at
the mines, Mr. Kirchhoff thinks that the
production of copper in the United States
will be considerably larger in 1903 than it
has ever' been. , The Lake Superior dis
trict.will yield, considerably more copper;
-Arizona is expected to return a consider
ably larger product; Utah may reach a
total of 35,000,000 pounds, and Wyoming,
Nevada, Colorado, New. Mexico and the
Southei-n States will report an: increase: ,
Tho consumption of copper in the United
States .was enormous in 1902. It was
larger also in other leading industrial
countries. "
As compared with 263,782 long tons in
1901, the total production of copper in tho
United States in 1992 was 2'J4,423 long tons,
of which the Lake Superior district pro
duced 76,165, or 25.9 per cent; Montana,
12S.975 long tons, or 43.8 per cent, and Ari
zona, 53,547 long tons, or 1S.2 per cent.
This is an increase in the total produc
tion of 25,641 long tons, or nearly 10 per
cent, as compared with 1901.
Utah is forging to the front as one of
the most important copper States, and it
is notably in' the Bingham camp that de
velopment has been most rapid.
Only small .quantities of copper ore
have been shipped from Alaska to Puget
Sound smelters, but it is known that
large deposits of, .copper ore exist, whoso
development is being taken seriously in
hand.
The imports of copper ore In 1902 were
valued at $7,:>zl,G41, as compared with $14,
394,663 in 1901, and the imports of copper
in bars, ingots, pigs and in manufactured
forms were valued at 512,804,021, as com
pared with $11,820,439 in 1901. The exports
of domestic copper in . different forms
were valued at $46,811,729 in 1902, as com
pared with $36,071,448 in 1901. The exports
from Baltimore, Md., increased from 54,
377,355 pounds in 1901 to 103,607,256 pounds
in 1902, and from New York the increase
was from 133,540,150 pounds in 1S01 to 238,
622,515 pounds in 1902.
In the . aggregate the reporting mine*
had a stock of 155,665,652 pounds of copper
on January 1, 1903, as compared with 282,
014,297 pounds on January 1, 1902, a decline
of over 126,000,000 pounds during 1902.
The estimated consumption in 1902 was
551,688,191 pounds, as compared with 3S2,
761,014 pounds in 1901, and with 356,891,121
pounds in 1900. The average selling price
of lake copper during 1902 was 11.86 cents
per pound. ;] y Â¦-Â¦''

She was a sharp-eyed, independent lit

a reader of character he would have

She; had ridden two blocks before- the

said. "I'll get off here." \V .;
"But you can't get off without paying

"I. can't, eh," she answered. "Well, let
me see you collect it."
She made for the door, but the conduc

the bell rope.
"You stop this car or you'll be sorry
for it," she exclaimed angrily.
After a couple of blocks more the con

"You must pay your fare before you

That was all he could think to say.

herself down in a seat again. "I guess I

"You might^s well get off here, then,

The woman stepped haughtily to the

Longevity in the United States.
The United States census for 1900 finds
2S3C persons In the United States who are
300 or more years of age. The value of
these figures may be questioned and per
haps may be best estimated by the fact
that T2.8 per cent of the whole number are
negroes, many of whom have no reliable
evidence a* to the date of their birth.
They are but 11 per cent of the total pop
ulation. It seems Improbable, too, that
this country should have over 3500, when
Germany, with a population of nearly
65.000,000. has only 778. and England, with
32.000.000. only 146, and France, with 40
000,000, has only 211
Admiral -Watson " always prohibited

ed to be,- and if any Luckless officer.en
forced an order from the bridge with an;
oath, he was .called upon for a private
interview with his' superior. But another
matter in his squadron trgubled^the ad
miral. His was the flagship and yet the
men were sometimes the last to, finish
the execution of p. command or to carry
out a maneuver. One day when the se*a
men were behind in getting down front the
rigging he called the captain to" him..
"Why is it," he asked, "that here on
the flagship, where we oaght to be. tho
quickest, the men are behind the other
ships?"
While the officer was seeking. for an in
offensive reply, a volley of oaths came
floating across the water* from the cap
tain of the nearest ship.

get the right kind, of encouragement, sir." |

Not Properly Encouraged'..
One of the most striking objects, in the
exhibit of the Canadian Pacific Railway
at the Dominion Exposition is a gigantic
moose head that was shot by Mr. Fred
Southam of Montreal in the'Kippewa dis
trict, to the eastward of Lake Temiska
ming. . The span, of these antlers .is 62*4
inches, and the head would have gone 63
were it not that a small fragment has
been chipped off one horn in combat.
Only a few years ago sportsmen doubted
the existence of even a 00 inch head, but
for some unexplained reason moose heads
in Northern Quebec and in the lower
provinces appear to be larger now than
was the case a generation or two ago.
At any rate, this big bull carried a head
such as our grandfathers probably never
saw. Mr. Southam came upon the animal
at dusk one evening and killed it with
one shot from his little 30-30 Winchester.
It is hardly probable that any sportsmen
have seen such a big moose head, unless
it should have been one of the giant Alas
kan head3, which are, by the way, , car
ried by a different sub-species of moose.'â

When. the British-Boer war broke out
in 1899 the; British. Government claimed
tho Britannic ; for use as a transport. In
1900 "she was selected' to convey the im
perial corps/which escorted the Prince
of Wales on his tour- of -the 'colonies,
making the trip i of 29,000 miles.. This was
the end of her . military service, and
since then she -has been, lying' at Belfast.
: The Britannic between 1874 and 1S99
made, some 2G0 .voyages between New
York and Liverpool," crossing tne Atlan
tic .; more v than 500 . times. She traveled
about- 1,800.000 miles, or enough to take
her more than seventy times around the
world* arid "carried more than 200,000 pas
sengers. Â¦ â¢ - . , ;
s Tfie'.Britanrtic was Â¦ built In 1874. and
soon after, being; built reduced the time
between Queenstowri and Sandy Hook, to
less thah eight .'days. -She established a
record for 'the' eastward voyage of seven
days s'lxtecri hours. '" " " ' '
The Brjtannic was considered- a wonder
in her day, not only for her speed, but
for 'size and luxury. She has used the
engines and* bojlers which' were put into
Tier when she. was built, never missing. a
day through accident or disability. â¢â¢
The Britannic made better time after
years of continuous service than, when
first put In service, making her. 31Sth
trip in September, â¢ 1890, in seven days, six
hours and fifty-five minutes, breaking her
previous . record, made In 1888, of- seven
days, nine "hours and thirty minutes, af
terward crossing In seven days, six hours
and fifty-two minutes.
Her best westward record was made In
August, 1896, seven days, seven hours and
thirty minutes. Twenty-nine years of
service under her original engines and
boilers is a record not likely to be ap
proached, by ocean steamships* for>years

REFORM FORCES
GAIN A VICTORY
Which, is the oldest crew that ever
tailed? Some seamen would say it must
be that ghestly one which has for almost
three ccr.turies been trying to navigate
the Flying Dutchman round the Cape of
Good Hope; but. putting superstition
apide, an answer may be found in the
ship's company of the -William Crow of
Yarmouth, lost about three years ago off
Hartlepooi. The vessel carried four
hands, of whom the youngest was GS, the
ru-xt C3â these two did duty aloft â the cap
tain 70 and the cabin "boy" had attained
to the patriarchal age of 72.
This is reminiscent of crews supplied to
the ships of Commodore Anson's squad
ron when they were fitting out for his fa
mous voyage around the world. For this
purpose 500 invalids were ordered to be
collected from the out-pensioners of Cht-I
pc-a. and in answer to Anson's expostula
tions th* admiralty authorities of the day
told him j that they "thought them the
poorest men that coi^ld be employed on
this occasion." But a great number of
the r.ta themselves thought differently,
for, althocgb the whole were conveyed
to Port.'rr.outh. only 255 joined the squad
ron, for, as Anson's chronicler puts it,
fall those that had limbs and strength
deserted, leaving behind only such as were
literally invalids, most of them being 60
years of agp, and s*>me upward of 70."
Either from compulsion or from choice
some of the vessels of our mercantile ma
rine carry crews who. in a different way,
are almott ap helpless as those supplied
to Anson. Thus, at an inquiry recently
into the loss of a British bark it trans
pired that the helmsman at the wheel at
the time of the wreck was a foreigner, ig
norant of the Ergllsh language, with
whom no one on board the ship was capa
ble of communicating in his own tongue,
which was Spanish, and the man himself
was unable to convey to the court the
difference between port and starboard . â¢
But if we are surprised thus to hear or
a steersman who was dumb for all prac
tical purposes, what is to be said of . a
whole crew of blind men? The storyâ as
grisly a one as sea history holdsâ is told
by Buston, the great anti-slavery agi
tator, who says that in one Instance the
crew of a schooner making the Middle
Passage all caught ophthalmia from their
living freight, and the vessel groped help
lessly about the Atlantic until picked up
quite by chance.
A more cheerful tale of a curious kind
of crew came recently from Kiel, where
a Turkish corvette had been sent in con
nection with some repairs. The Turks on
board having exhausted both money and
credit, and being still without money
frcm their Government, stripped the ship
bare of everything pawnable in order to
purchase provisions, and, having done so,
were actually on the point of starvation
in port when diplomatic intervention pro
cured them funds from Constantinople.
It was a crew of Turkish women also
that worked the SOOO-ton steamship Zora
';uite recently, from Alcxandretta to Phil
adelphia, but this is not so wonderful
when It is remembered that on our own
coasts, r.ot so long ago. crews of women
wore occasionally seen. There was, for
instance, one ancient brig which traded
across the Irish Sea up to the time when
the earlier merchant shipping acts put
an end to her career. The vessel was the
sole support of two elderly sisters, who,
vith other female help, navigated It from
port to port, and who are reputed, ac
cording to those who have known them,
to have had a kitchen garden on the poop
a lid a regular poultry yard under the
forecastle.â London Tit-Bits.

Yacht- racing commenced in 1662, when
Charles II, who had some yachts built
.for him by Sir Phineas Pett. wagered $500
that -a' yacht of. his would beat a. Dutch
one owned 'by 'his brother the Duke of
Yo:k; afterward James 11. feut the growth
of * yacht .sailing was slow, and it is not
urU'H 1720 that an authentic record of a
yacht club Is found, in which year the
Cprk' Harbor Water Club â now known as
the Royal Cork Yacht Clubâ was formed.
In-lS12. a similar club, the Yacht Club, was
formed "at .Cowes by some fifty yachts
men. --This club in 1S20 attracted the no
tice 'of the Di:ke of Clarence, afterward
Willram IV. .when its title was altered
to. the Royal Yacht Squadron. Cowes.
Fourteen years later William IV* present
ed-the. first royal cup to this club. But
ln"1851 only 500 yachts were in existence.
Since the international yacht race of that
year the Increase in the number has. been
immense. â London Chronicle.
' Though 'ivess'els.anawe'ring' to the char
acter of., yachts were in use by royal per
sonages.from an early dateâ Queen Eliza
beth, for instance. "had one built at Cowes,
Isle of . Wight, iii 1588â the word "yacht"
w*as not used until the year 1660, when
the Dutch presented a "jacht" named the
'-Mary to pharlea II. In Evelyn's Diary,
under October 1," 1661, occurs the entry:
"I sailed this morning with hla Majesty
in" one Of. his yachts, vessels not known
among, us till the Dutch East India Com
pany that curious piece to the
King, ticins very excellent sailing ves

The Call has repeatedly p6inted out thai. phase of
the situation and exposed the absurdity of- represent
ing the Bulgarian bandits as mild-mannered patriot
martyrs dying .for religion's sake. Recently' "At
lantis." a "Greek newspaper published in New York
and printed mainly in the Greek language, set forth
the injustice -done to "the Greeks by the /Bulgarian
reports. After stating that 'the "practice of the Bul
garian insurgents is to attack a wealthy Greek village
in Macedonia for the double, purpose* of obtaining
plunder and compelling the Turks to complete the
destruction of the village in their efforts^ to regain
possession of it, and after reciting "numerous in
stances where such, tactics were carried out, "At
lantis" says: "The methods of the Bulgarians. show*
G- REEK opposition to the Bulgarian "insurrec
, .tion in- Macedonia has not received the atten
. tion it merks from the -general public. As a
ruje the disturbance in'the Balkahs has beea depicted
as an uprising "of Christians against Moslems, and the
Moslem's have Jaeen painted about as bla.ck as ink
can. make them, while the Christians have been repre
sente.d- as Christians in very fact and feeling instead
of mere titular Christians.. Such presentations gite
an erroneous idea, of tl. : situation and the
struggle. It.i-s not a fight of 'Christian against Mos

It is certainly time that something be done. The
"?sue has been before Congress and before the coun
try for years. Again and again the Republican party
has pledged its nominees to adopt some effective sj'S
trm of promoting our merchant marine, and Republi
can Presidents have duly urged Congress to fulfill
the pledge. The opponents of American shipping in
tercrt? have, however.- been h'therto able to defeat
each plan proposed. Now the question is to come
ap again. This lime there should be.such a demon
slnst'on of popular earnestness in the" matter thatthe
opposition will be overcome and an effective ship
ping bill pas* *
A significant evidence of .the- change of- Western
sentiment on this subject is afforded by the ressoJ?"- I
tions adopted at the late ">'mee|.ing\- "of .the" Trans 1
Mississippi Commercial .CCngress*. ,On' the subject
of ocean shipping the resolutions declare: 0 y.Tbat the"
decline of our oversea American m'erchant marine
from carrying 90 per cent of our exported, products
in American bottoms down; ,to 9 per cest^ is- a.n
anomaly in the industrial developmenfÂ°of the. United
States, and for a nation with a greater coastline and
greater resources than any other, and r an unbroken <
record of enterprise and intrepidity on thg ..ocean.
That every ship is a missionary of trsje;Â» that steam
ship lines work for their own countries just, is, rail
road lines work for their terminal points, and that
it is as absurd for the United States to depend upon
foreign ships to distribute its products as it woul'd"
be for a department store to depend upon the wagons
of a competing house to deliver its goods. That it
is the sense of this congress that the Congress of the
United States should enact such laws as will tendjto
build up the American merchant marine." â¢;.
With declarations of that kind coming from thor
oughly representative non-partisan gatherings in the
interior of the country, and with an earnest cam
paign of education on the subject going on among
commercial bodies from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
it is assured that the President will have powerful
backing when he undertakes the task of inducing
Congress to enact the desired legislation at the
coming: session.

Â» . .- Have you seen theÂ° Gadden Girl?. Do you -know anything about her? H
B If yo'u-Sre a woman don't sav that you never heard , of her. for just at f 1
H the present time "she is one of the mo'st original creators of fashions in Eg
M ' Uncfe Sam ! s D realm. She is the originator -of the iridescent pearl for hair N
If ' orrraments and she "wears them in quantity t'hat is nothing short of amaz- 1 1
'S, '"P- Â° And whafthink you of the musical jewels? That is another of the M
W Gadden Girl's fads. Tewels set to dulcet harmonies â a fad in itself suf- M
M ficient to make a belle of anv girl even "less remarkable than the Gadden Â§1
M Â¦ Girl. While as, for color sche'mesin dresi-^-. However, pictures tell more |j
Jm than words ever can. in .the descriptions of' feminine raiment at anv rate. ||
B o therefore the front paee of the tiext Sunday Call will be more eloquent H
y than= reams on reams of'writin.sr to the women readers. If vou want to I j
M ?ee novelty in coiffure, novelty in jewelry, 'you won't miss the Gadden M ,
fl Nor will you" miss "The Woman of the World," by Colonel Kate. II
H which. is an article conceived and written by this clever writer in this ||
B clever writer's verv best stVie." ISIoreover, it contains thincs that every tj
H woman and not g few men wa.nt to know. Of course you are still won- H
H der.ing whether Colonel Kate is. a J" 3 *"* or a woman? That is a tanta- ||
H lizing mystery that adds immeasurably to the charm of these exclusive F]
Â§1 articles. * f*
g ' And while on the subiect df bright, snappy articles that^vou will be j|
H sÂ«rt to read in the next Sundav Call the "Me-ows of a Kittv" should not * j
m be omitted. These soicv savines are being quoted everywhere, and of fj
â¢ 3 course you've seen the cats. Everybody, by the way. is talking about I
H those cats .and next Sunday'* Call contains a perfect love of a kittv. i
83 But better than all else for those who want to read the literature that |
R is most popular to-dav and which will go far toward making up the clas- |
El sics of the future, there is no limit to the good things. Â£
M First there is a short storv masterpiece by Jack London, the most i
H famous writer of the lure of the Arctic in the whole world. It is "Where a
M' the Trail Forks." and it is thrilling from the very first to the verv last a
H word. A
M Next there is the fascinating two-page story by Frank H. Soearman. P
H' "The Nieht Watchman's Storv." If you have read any of this exclusive tÂ£
P series of Spearman's railroad stories you certainly won't miss this. In B
Â¦ point of fact when vou see the pictures that illustrate it you won't be able F*j
H "to resist readine it anvwav. ' lÂ§
y Then there are two full oaees of "Half-hour Storiettes." the latest gj
Â§1 â¢ craze in literature. . In other words that means eight more of the best "' |jjj
Df short stories that are beiner written to-day. These alone\vould cost vou jS
H anywhere else more than the price of the entire Sunday Call. Eg
m Â¦ And this does not include th* third installment of the latest book bv ij
H the famous author of "Chimmie Fadden." It is "Lees and Leaven." rf
m which has broueht E. W. Townsend to the fore as nothine before had t*j
|1 And then there are the "Recollections and Reflections" of the Bonanza f f i
H ?in?s xvbn out a eirdle of eoM around thÂ«* world, written bv Thomas Kj
H Fitch. Th"s series alone would cost you Si. 50 anywhere else. pj
H And th"n there areâ but whv enumerate everything in the next Sun- a
y day Call? If you want the verv best that is goinjr in _ the literary and y
II magazine wav you won't nee* rnore than the above brief outline. And 1
P you won't miss the Gadden Girl in any event. Â«|WASHINGTON. Sept. 3d.â Edward Mi-Kit

Mrs. Wilson says: "My little daughter Alice
suffered from catarrh, and her ears discharged
a foul Emelllne matter. â¢ She was rapidly
growing deaf. Her ears were yery painful and
Bhe was afraid cf doctors. I took her to the,
Electro-Chemlc Institute. 118 Grant ave.. and I
am happy to say that , the Electro-Chemic
treatment has cured Alice perfectly, and there
was not a moment's pain during; the two
months' treatment that was required. She
hears perfectly now, | the ears do not run any

of the treatment has been very little."

came Oluf Henry Rudolf Petersen to-day
when it came to forswearing his alls

and he broke down and cried when it
came to taking the oath required of him
In order to become a citizen of the United
States. Only the assurances of his broth
er, Nills H. Petersen. that many of their

thing before them, finally satisfied him
that he was not a traitor to the flag that
protected him at his birth. In the ancient

The two Petersens appeared before
Chief Deputy George Pierce- to-day to de
clare their Intentions of becoming citizens
of this country and to take out their first

when they were required to hold up their

their allegiance to King Christian IX. the
reigning sovereign of Denmark. Oluf

on with the obligations.
He talked fast to his brother in his na

the necessary obligation and explained tho
cause of his brother's refusal. He then
went and talked to him and " finally

ALAilEDA. Sept. SO.â Vice President
Ivy L>. Borden o! the Bank of Alameda.
ex-Senator Edward K. Taylor, Howard
K. James and Frank E. Heath were par
ticipants in a sensational melee In Judge
P. S. Cone's courtroom to-day, which
ended with the partial -wrecking' of the
temple of Justice and an uncomfortable
squeezing: for James, who was jammed
behind a door until the- hinges save way
and permitted him to draw his breath.
Heath precipitated the trouble by at
tempting to assault Borden, who, as the
representative of the Bank of Alameda.
bad just been awarded $113 damages In
a suit against T. Vonah, a former asso
ciate of Heath in the dairy business.
Heath was called by the defense as a
witness in the trial. When Judge Cone
announced his decision and retired to his
private chamber Heath said to Borden:
"Well, you will never collect that money.
I've cot a notion to take It out of your
hide. I'll do It right now." "With this
threat Heath stepped out of the hallway
leading from the little courtroom, strip
ped off his coat and started to re-enter
the building.
Â¦ James, who acted as attorney for Vonah,
threw all his weight against the portal
In an effort to close it. Heath came up
against the door like a battering ram.
Then James and the door were swept
back and struck the wall with a double
thud. The door fell off and James fell
down.
Then it was that Taylor, the lawyer for
the Bank of Alameda. got Into action.
He took on an Eddie Hanlon crouch and
butted the excited Heath into the street.
Borden called on the Judge for protec
tion and his Honor called the police. By
this time James and Taylor had got
Heath into a flying wedge and hustled
him alens: to Santa Clara avenue, where
he cooled off under a tree. No arrests
, were made, but Judge Cone notified James
that If repairs were not made to his
courtroom at Heath's expense he would
swear out a warrant for the door smasher
on a charge of malicious mischief.

MAJOR DELMAR
GOES FAST MILE
- - CINCINNATI, Sept. SO.â Major" Delraar
â¢ was driven Â¦ by Alta. McDonald against the
world's, trotting record -of. 2:00 at Oakley
Park r to-day and completed the milo in
2:00^4, which, is Hid fourth mile this season
better -than: 2:01- and the fastest mile ever
trotted in Ohio. The: track was In grand
shape, ; but there was a stiff breeze blow-
Ing ud the stretch.'
Â¦ Ttte first eighth .was passed In :15Â«. but
Delmar shifted from the ' trot to the pace.
McDonald pulled him up and came back.
The next : time he â¢. came down he was
going steadily,'. but seemingly not so fast-
He, drew in" closer to the rail as they
rounded the' first turn, but the track was
deeper .there "and McDonald pulled out a
yard or *so. by" the time they got. to the
quarter in :fflHi. Along the back stretch
the game little" gelding struck "a most
; pÂ«rfect stride - and he ; fairly flew. He
made -thÂ«? half in .:59%.: Around the far
turn. he came wlth;a swing that set the
great crowd- cheering lustMy. â¢ As regu
larly, as jsi: piece of machinery he strode
past the three-quarters in 1:29?4. The lun
ner in front .tired so perceptibly about
200 yards J from -. the wire that McDonald
was forced â¢ to : pull out from -behind the
shield for fear, of a spill. Under, the wire
hveame as strong as he went away and
was striding with astonishing ease. The
time,. 2:00}i, was received with â¢ a great
demonstration. : Summary:
