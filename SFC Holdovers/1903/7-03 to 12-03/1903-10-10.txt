Confirming the published accounts of
Balfour's of Chamberlain's
resignation, Ritchie said the Duke" -of
De\'onshire, m Lord Balfour of Burlefgh,
Lord George Hamilton and himself' met
after both Cabinet councils and decided
to send in their resignations without hav-^
ing heard- a, word to the effect that Cham
berlalh would resign. Ritchie strongly
attacked the Chamberlain policy, and de
clared that it would raise the cost of
everything.
His revelation of r the usually carefully
guarded secrets of the Cabinet councils,
for which he must have obtained : the
King's consent, is intensely interesting
as showing that he really precipitated^the
present struggle by opposing : Chamber
lain's demand for the retention of -the
grain duty and carrying : the majority; of
the Cabinet" with him against the Premier.'
The former Chancellor of the Exchequer
felt sure' that the 'preferential proposals
were merely an entering wedge :' which
would ultimately; land the country' In ! ; the
same position ' as 'Germany, where food
taxes had driven the .workingmen to so
cialism.
The mixed reception given to Ritchie is
regarded as an indication that Chamber
lain's scheme is taking hold of the country
and is fiercely dividing the Unionist party.
Incidentally Ritchie revealed that he was
solely responsible for the abolition of the
shilling duty on wheat He said that
Chamberlain proposed j to retain the duty
and give the colonies preference,, but the
speaker, believing that It was only the be
ginning of a larger scheme of protection,
threatened to resign if the duty was not
forthwith abolished. .
The speaker precipitated a scene of dis
order by declaring 'that "Chamberlain had
been inconsistent because * he* upheld free
trade while president of the Board of
Trade and protection while Colonlal'Bec
retary. ,
A large Liberal element was present.
The reception of Ritchie was decidedly not
harmonious, consisting.'. of* \ cheers, . .hoots
and counter-cheers for Joseph Chamber
lain.

the New Jersey and New York Railroad
or the New York, Susquehanna and "West

and Western v?as also badly crippled. On
the Pennsyh-ania It was stated that regu

The only delay to the trains on the
New York, New Havpn and Hartford
Railroad was during the heaviest part of
the storm, when the water rose to a
height of three feet on the tracks In the
Bronx,, and the engineers were obliged
to run cautiously. By the time the "storm
had cleared, however,' the local trains
were running on their regular schedules.
Only one life was reported lost, that of
a Klrt drowned by the carrying away of a
bridge over a creek. Thousands of New
Jersey commuters slept In New York to
r.ight. being unable to return to their
homes*
A great part of the city was laid under
water and scores of great plants, Includ

were flooded and shut down. Involving a
Jbsa estimated at fully $1,000,000.
OHX LIFE IS LOST.
Reports of extensive floods and serious
damage to property and Interruptions of
traffic came from almost all sections of
New Jersey and Long Island. In Newark,
P&ssaic and other large manufacturing
centers many factories were closed owing
to the flooding of engine-rooms. In many
places electric light and power plants were
fhut down for the same reason. A dam

Paterson was one of the worst sufferers,
and for a time this afternoon there was
grave darper of a repetition of the terri

the flood is subsiding and 'all danger is
believed to be over.
HEAVY PROPERTY LOSS.
Suburban steam and trolley lines, with
hardly an exception, were crippled by
floods and washouts, and In the early
morning rush hours thousands of sub
urban residents were unable to reach
their offlces in this city. Those who were

he- arrived, here last : Monday. Â¦ night and
the first Intimation Â¦ his , acquaintances
here received that he "was married was
.when they read the notice. of the arrival
of himself and wife, at the Palace. Dur
ing -his short, stay there Mr. and Mrs.
Kohn were. seldom seen . about ' the. Hotel,
apparently preferring the seclusion of
their apartments, while their colored ser
vant attended to their wants on the out
side. On. the. way out to the coast Kohn
had suffered continuously for. the want of
his. accustomed drug,, and at .times his
nervous condition was j of an alarming
character. Kohn had but, a short time
before succumbed ' to" ' the importunities
of his young wife, , and ..with her en
couragement .he was struggling desper
ately to . subdue, his appetite. When the
couple reached this city, Kohn was almost
a wreck. It had been the wish of Mrs.
Kohn' that he should seek some cure for
his vice and he had promised to submit
to a physician's treatment on his arrival
There. True to his word the husband sum
moned medical assistance Tuesday after
noon. Upon the recommendation of one
prominent . physician he engaged the. ser
vices of Dr.- D. M. Gedge of 1 2004 . Stelner

Kohn entered the Adler Sanatorium
Thursday afternoon. It being agreed that
his wife should go with him and attend
him. The: remainder of the story leading
up to the death of Kohn is best told in
the words of his pretty young wife, who

SIR THOMAS LIPTON
SAILS FOR ENGLAND
While the foregoing reflects the senti

that there may be a different feeling in
the Russian Orient. Some disquiet has
been caused by a statement made by a
Port Arthur newspaper, the Novykrai,
declaring that the Japanese Foreign and
War Ministers have Joined the Japanese
The Japanese Minister here, M. Kurino,
said to-day that he has seen no indica
tions of warlike disposition here. He
has always found Foreign Minister Lams
dorff ready candidly to discuss Russo-
Japanese relations. The Japanese Minis
ter said there were no reasons' why the
Governments Fhould not reach a peaceful
settlement. He added that although he
was a careful reader of -the Japanese
newepapers he found no warlike tenden
cies in any of the influential papers and
claimed that the Russian papers cited
comments from unimportant Japanese
sheets. ,': '. .-. .
The newspapers here publish extracts
from the Japanese press Indicating hostil
ity to Russia, but the Russian editorials
preserve studied calmness. Diplomatic
circles are aware that the situation in
spires some uneasiness, but they believe
that the Government anticipates a peace
ful solution.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 9.â The state
ment published in the United States yes
terday by a news agency that an anti-
Japanese war .sentiment prevails here is
false. Russian society is absolutely not
given to "jingoism"; the Government re
mains peacefully disposed and the For
eign Office disclaims the slightest senti
ment of hostility. " L

exception to Joseph Chamberlain's quo

the Industries of both countries were pro

WASHINGTON, Oct 9.â
Diligent inquiry at the State De
partment for official information
as to the likelihood of a clash be
tween Russia and Japan over
Korea failed to elicit anything
more pointed than an expression
of opinion that "Nothing is likely
to happen this winter." No one
ventures to predict what may hap
pen in the spring, when the north
ern ports begin to thaw out. They
will soon be frozen too tight for
any military operations.
"Xo official in the War Depart
ment believes the United States
will be in any danger of complica
tions in the Far East," said a
member of President Roosevelt's
Cabinet. He added, "It seems a
question which involves Russia
and the Asiatic nations alone."
This comment is indicative of the
feeling which prevails here. The
United States, having obtained its
two open ports, has taken a posi
tion of being removed from dan
ger, and from its vantage point
of neutrality will unconcernedly
watch Russia and Japan fly at
each other.
The Chinese Minister called on
Secretary Hay this morning. He
was much disturbed at the reports
that Russia had made no move
toward evacuating Manchuria.
However, it is understood that he
is not surprised, having been ad
vised several weeks ago that Rus
sia would not do so until China
granted the demands in regard to
Russian influence in Manchuria.

CHICAGO, Oct. 9.â Sensation*! detail*
of the alleged "high financiering" which
is said to have caused the failure of the
commission house of Porter Bros, vom
pany, with liabilities of Jl.000.000, were
brought out In the hearing to-day before
Referee in Bankruptcy Frank I*. Wean.
The main fight was over the allegation
that the company paid thousands of dol
lars in dividends to favored stockholders
during years when the books showed that
it was losing $100,000. President James
Watson's management was bitterly at
tacked. Witness John R, Adams, the
treasurer, declared that he knew very
little of the inner secrets of the corpora
tion.
"I signed all checks at the dictation of
Mr. Watson." he said.
N. R. Doe. a New Tork stockholder, is

of the concern. Doe has also started' suit
for $200,000 undivided profits which he al
leges is due him.
A generally? lower level of quotations
for the leading farm ', staples was most
encouraging. It Indicated that supplies
were, comlne freely to market and testi
fied to the growing confidence in staple
crops.'.- Speculative control ceased with
the marketine of greater' quantities than
the 'Â¦ manipulators could handle and the
grain trade always flourishes better when
nqrmal influences prevail. Lower prices
also attract purchasers abroad and for
eign commerce will r be stimulated. A
moderate recovery late in the week was
natural, as offerings became sufficiently
narrow to bring out many buyers, who
feared. the violent price changes of -, past

.Reduced dividends aha curtailed 1 pro
duction in -the iron and' steel industry
show that conservatism is increasing and
that there Is no disposition to. 'disguise
the fact that business' is not; progressing
without interruptions.
"Thevbest trade advices come from the
Southwest, notably at Kansas City and
St. Louis: from . the western sections,
such as Nebraska and, Iowa, where corn
is turning: out better than expected; from
the Pacific Coast, where trade is still/un
qualifiedly good . despite the slowness of
new wheat and other crops to move, and
from portions of the South, such as the
Mississippi Valley, where present prices
for cotton offered a good return for fair
yields. . â¢ .
R. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly. Review of
Trade to-morrow will say:
There have been no development of im
portance in the commercial world. As a
rule there is more caution In making con
tracts, especially among â¢ manufacturers.
Uneasiness regarding the, financial situa
tion recedes as the season advances with
out producing any monetary pressure. in
connection with crop moving. The pro
posed reduction in pigiron . output has
been indorsed by all leading producers,
steadying-, prices Just ; changes In
freight ..rates .started* another- reduction.
Other news Is favorable,
except where the raw material markets
are unsettled or labor struggles cause
trouble. Suspension of an iron plant was
attributed to the' latter causu and the
movement of- cotton at New Orleans suf
fered also because of a strike.
RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASE.
Trade locally is quiet, preparations for
the elections, with unseasonable weather,
having an adverse, effect. Railways are
not yet severely congested by the. crops,
yet there 'is some delay in traffic and
earnings for September are 8.1 per cent
larcer than last year's. Latest returns
of; foreign commerce at this port are un
satisfactory, exports showing a loss of
J1.5S8.644 compared with the same week
last year and Imports decreasing $2,577,623.
The ' growing weakness;., in " j plgiron,
though oh -the face of it unfavorable,
will have the effect- of shuttinir off pro
duction, to the extent of onÂ© million tons
for the last quarter of the -year and of
ending fOxeign imports. Two prominent
Industries,"* those of shoe manufacturing
and of anthracite coal, have been and are
doing well, though margins,' of profit are
smaller. The downward . swing in the
raw material of , industry : is, in fact, a
significant feature. Â¦ - . Â¦ Â¦
WEAKNESS IN FIGIB0N.
The volume of business doing by the
railroads is excellent, thou^n the familiar
car shortage -irouble is looming up despite
improvemertts in terminal facilities.
Many underlying conditlonff are how
ever,, still favorable. First in importance
should be reckoned > the decidedly" better
tone of advices from th^ corn' crop", which
has developed a better quality and a
largrer. yield 'than was deemed possible.
Special inquiry ,by Bradstreot ; s agent
point to a yield of "at, least 2,250,000 bushels,
of a grade far superior to that of a
year ago. Lower prices for this and other
cereals and- for cotton, whose yield will
be smaller thah k seemed probable a month
ago, seem likely to help :' our .backward
export trade in these products and Im
prove the foreign 'exchange "outlook., Col
lections, too,, though backward, are im
proving asvthe grain and cotton move
ments expand. .- '. .' v . >-

A dispatch received from Chicago late

marriage is not known there! ' The young
man was widely known in Chicago,
where his father, Henry A. Kohn, was a
pioneer . in the clothing manufacturing
business. Young Kohn was a native of
Chicago and was identified with a number
of enterprises In that city, ibelng at the

WOMAN'S STORY CONFIRMED.:
It is probably better that I should tell the
truth and offer you every facility for clearing
up any mystery that may be hovering over thlÂ«
Fad affair. As a girl I was Edith Webb and
my home is in Kentucky, where my mother
arid two sisters now live. I must refuse to give
the name of the town, for I don't want them
to hear of this matter until I have been able
to communicate with them and relieve them of
the anxiety that will naturally follow the news
of my misfortune in thia city. As to my mar
riage with Abe Kohn and . my residence in
Chicago the facts- as I have recited them to you
can be easily confirmed by telegraphing to
I^ke Beulah or -to Chicago. * .
Before leaving the "sanatorium Mrs.
Kohn said that Dr. Gedge admonished
her not to hold conversation with any one,
particularly with newspaper reporters.
She tried to secrete herself during the
day, but finally yielded to the questions
put to her by The Call interviewer, re
marking, as the tears continued to course
down her checks, that it was hard fora
young and friendless woman to maintain
silence, In her moments of sadness.
"There is no longer any reason why I
should conceal the fact of .our mar
riage," said she. "The time has
come when I must appear as his-wife in
the eyes of the world. I will call on his
relatives &a soon as I reach Chicago, and
I am certain they will welcome me." ' ?
! "When pressed with- questions as to, her
past and " oarticularly as^ to her family
connections the young woman's replies
were at first evasive, but she finally re
marked: Â¦ â¢ .
Under the Influence of " the" drug my. husband
soon v fell asleep, and, -fatigued by. my long
hours of anxiety over his condition, I' was also
soon slumbering. About 12:30 o'clock that night.
I awoke, and for a time remained with - my
eyes resting upon my husband, who s&emlngly
was sleeping peacefully by my Bide. 7, Of: si
sudden It occurred to ma that he vwas '.-rtot
breathing, and, hurriedly placing my : 'hand
upon his. forehead, the awful realization came
to me that he was- dead. For several moments
I was as if paralyzed. . Then, jumping -out'lof*
bed, I turned up the light and, glancing at his
fixed-eyes, which- were partly opened,; * I -knew
that all was over.' 'My cries for > help; brought
the nurses and twae finally taken. Into another
room whlltt-the Jast duties over the dead, were
performed by the Â¦ attendants. . . . r Â¦Â¦ Â« .., '
Why there should have beenso much spcrecyr
about, my husband's death I cannott explain;
unless -it was the desire of his relatives to'
avoid the -notoriety that might follow. â¢', Wh'eri
the day had advanced and a response, had been;
received to the telegram sent- to Mrs. Strauss-
In Chicago," directing that my husband's re
mains be Immediately shipped to. thatt city;. Dr.
Gedge came to me and said that the best thing
for me to do would be to leave for Chicago ort
the evening train, he explaining that, the body:
was about to be turned over to an undertaker
and that I would not be able to seejmy hus
band's face again until the funerali in " that
city. - I was alone In a strange city and;readlly
yielded to the advice. Later, however; I en
gaged a room at the California Hotel' with thq
idea of remaining in the city until my husr
hand's body started on Its journey to Chicago.'

BUEF'S BIG GBAFT.
The professional politicians of the jew-
Fmlth type have had sway at the City
Hall for many years. It is common
Â¦knoTrl^dgv that nothing has been done by
ttw tax-eating- fraternity for the better
ment of the city. Disputes over the divi-
Flon of official plunder and the distribu
tion of the spoils Apolitics are constant
ly occurring. It Is common remark that
the st^ets are unswept. that the sewers
are chdked with debris and that needed
repairs to public thoroughfares are ne
plected. Whpn our versatile Mayor Is not
in town hobnobbing with Ruef and admir
ing the pranks of Parr.v, and the colt, he
is out of the State electioneering tn be
half of Democratic candidates for Con-
Krees In the city of New York.
HENHY J. CROCKER, Repub
lican candidate for Mayor,
will speak In frank and man
ly style to his fellow citizens
of San Francisco at the AJ
hambra, corner of Eddy and
Jones streets, this evening-. In a sense
Mr. Crocker Is more than a party noml
ree in this campaign. He is the candi
date of the peopleâ the representative of
workingrTien. business men and the vast
legion of taxpayers who supply the
money to defray the expenses of local
government. Delegates to the Republican
convention, perceiving that there was a
v.-idespread request for a good business
â¢man to manage municipal affairs, gave
Mr. Crocker the nomination for Mayor.
The comment Is everywhere heard that
Mr. Crocker Is not a professional office
seeker. He is not out for a political Job,
but he stands ready, to give to his fellow
men of the metropolis the benefit of his
business training and ability In the man
epement of city affairs.
There are two parties that are well recog
nizedâthe Republican and the Democratic par
ties. Other parties have ccme along, but only
have lasted a short time. Tou can look back
Into history and you will find that the Republi
can and Democratic parties have existed before
most of us were born. Now I want to bring
that down to this point. The labor party Is a
party that has been thinking. A great manr
of the laboring men have come to the conclu
sion that it Is not wise to go into politics and
establish thÂ«ir cwn party ideas before a com
munity and a great many have shown that
from time to time, until now they believe that
one of us must be elects. I believe the com
munity Is ruing to adopt the Republican Idea.
I believe that those people I have mentioned
are going to vote the Republican ticket this
year because thry have done *o In national poll,
ties and they will do It on November 3. Gen
tlemen. I thank you. (Great applause.)
There were more cheers for Mr. Crcck
er. and when the meeting adjourned he
personally met the members of his old
Club.
ABE BUT TWO PABTIES.
Now San Francslco U In that position to
day. She purpose, as was 6hown by the In
terest taken in the late bond election, by the
Interest taken in the Geary-street election, to
take a hand In the future of her own great
ness. The people of this city are going to
establish a regime In which I claim some meas
ure of Interest. The Republican standard
bearer will be followed by other candidates ot
the Eame class that he represents. It Is for
you voters to say whether a man who has
given his time and attention for years to the
facts and figures that confront him should be
The "question Is. how are the facts and fig
ures of the bond issue to be handled?. I made
a remark the other night that, after the litiga
tion over these bonds, the money would be
ready to be epent. I take it It Is a wise pre
caution and Is generally adopted that when any
large bond issue takes place there Is some
'.ittle friendly litigation to determine the validl
tv of the bonds. Then they are signed by the
corporation and then they are issued. What
Kan Francisco wants to do Is to have those
bonds properly Issued acd properly signed.
They should be a credit to San Francisco be
fore* the whole world, because a good bond of
a municipality will be found throughout the
world'. People Â»re seeking this kind of an In
vestment. We therefore want to give the best
title to these bonds. I say I am proud to rep
resent the class that will give good indorse
ment to the bonds. The people of the United
States want to have a good line of men to rep.
rÂ»*ent them from now on. That Is established
and It will be further established at the next
election.
CITY IS AWAKENING.
A business man may go and look around for
a favorable location for business and he will
apply fcr the rent of the building. When the
lÂ«?ase is presented, made out for a matter of
three or four years, he rays to the owner: "I
would like to have the privilege of ten or
twelve ye*rÂ» more of that lease." He figure*
that his business Is going to be successful and
he propones to continue at the same old stand.
This is a Republican city. There it no
doubt about it. The officers on the ticket well
represent the Republican rankp. The Republi
can candidate for Mayor has no smaJl chance
to go into office. I don't think there Is a
chance on earth for my defeat If I can hold
the Republican vote of this city, and I think
I will, and I think that not only will the Re
publican candidate tor Mayor be elected, but
the entire Republican ticket will be successful.

that San Krancisco is going to do something In
the tray of having nood representative men to
take charge of city affaire. This little cam
paign, which is of to much moment to me.

A BEPUBLICAHT CITY.
The Bear Club gave Henry J. Crocker,
standard bearer of the Republican party,
and other candidates who appeared before
It last night, rousing receptions. TTie
members made the halis of B'nai B'rlth
Hall resound with their shouts for the
head of the ticket. Oscar Tolle presided
at the meeting. The hall was crowded
and many of those present had to stand
In the hallway in order to listen to the
speakers. Mr. Crocker was sseorted to
the meeting place by Albert Castle and
Milton Esberg. two of his energetic work
ers. Before his arrival speeches were
made by General Salomon. "Ted" Lun
fctedt, John McDougald. Coionel Robert
Wieneke. Judge Van Nostrand, Thomas
Westoby and John Greif. The last named
delivered an earnest talk. He told the
members that If he were elected County
Ckrk they would have no cause to regret
it. He said he was familiar with the
workings of the office and promised a
good administration. Mr. Crocker .spoke
in part as follows:

far back as 1SS5. And It used to be a. great
question, ?Â¦specially la the Blaine campaign,
whether the old Dlrifo flub or the Bear Club
yllod the loudest, and it was a pretty even
proposition. Sometimes we had lots of vic
tories to shout for and sometimes we had to
take the "middle of the street and nee the othÂ»r
crQwd yell. But there Is going to be one event
wjiere the Bear Club Is ruing to yell Itself
hoarse, and that Is on November ?,. (Applause.)
I don't think I am premature in my guess, be
cause there Is not a member of the Bear Club
who hat not bc-?n able to so around and aej
where the signs are pointing.

DISCUSSES BOND ISSUE.
Crocker Delivers Strong: Talk Before
C. Brusle. Marc Anthony and E. D. Peix
otto are among the announced speakers.
It Is obvious to spectators of the pres
ent contest that the race Is between
Crocker and Schmlz. Lane talks of noth
ing but himself, and the subject Is no
longer interesting to the voters. If Mc-
Xab does not put a time lock on the Lane
jaw other candidates will get off the Dem
ocratic ticket. Henry Crocker Is gaining
strength on account of his manliness. He
does not feel called upon to mount a ped
estal, thump himself on the chest and pro
claim: "Look Into my eye; I am no
coward." That Is Lane's style of cam
paigning, and to some people It is funnier
than Billy Hynes' laughing song. Mr.
Crocker has a wide and favorable ac
quaintance in San Francisco. He is
known as a progressive, public spirited
man of force and energy. His election by
a large majority Is already predicted.

MAYOR MAKES SHOHT TALKi
Union Labor Meeting Forced to wait
Long for Schmitz.
Between 200 and 40") men gathered fn
the dining-room of the Central Hotel on
Third street last night and sweltered
through two and a half hours of waiting
in the stifling x and smoke laden atmos
phere to hear a few words from Mayor
Schmitz. He came at last and was greet
ed enthusiastically. Rousing cheers were
given repeatedly for him and when ho
finally stepped to the platform he was
compelled to wait several seconds while
his supporters vented their jubilations.
The late hour caused the principal
speaker to abridge his remarks to a nve
mlnute talk, In the course of which he
said that he had made a tour of the mer
cantile district during the day and what
he heard there was enough to discourage
him. He plucked hope, however, from
the warm greeting extended him by the
meeting. He said that Lane was making
his campaign In bad faith and was pur
posely endeavoring to draw unto himself
votes from the worklngmen without hope
of being elected Mayor, but simply to de
tract from the strength of the Union La
bor candidate.
Nearly everv candidate of the Union
Labor ticket was given a chance to show
himself and all made brief remarks. Har
ry Knox and J. C. Williams, candidates
respectively for Supervisor and Recorder,
made more extended efforts, as did Dr.
Dillon, candidate for Coroner. The sup
ply of candidates ran out long before the
Mayor arrived, so "Walter Gallagher was
called to entertain the crowd during the
wait. He succeeded In holding most of
them with a fierce arraignment of every
thing past, present and future that did
not bear a union label.
HENRT J. CROCKER'S recep
tion at the hands of the
Greek-American Republican
Club last night must have
filled his heart with gladness.
| They cheered him loyally and
throughout his address they applauded
him. He had been addressing the mem
bers of the Bear Club on the floor be
low and was Invited by the members of
the Greek Club to come upstairs and
speak before their organization. Noth
ing loth, Mr. Crocker mounted the stairs
and entered while an election of officers
was in progress. Those who recognized
the Republican standard bearer cheered
lustily for him. In his speech to the
Greeks Mr. Crocker said In part:
Gentlemen. I don't think a club in its or
ganization should be Interrupted. 1 want tÂ«
epClogize for my being here, but olrcumstances
over which I had no control brought me here
and I am srlad that I am here. I was down
stairs and W3.4 asked If I would not spt-ak a
few words to this organization, and I said I
would be only too glad to do so.
I have not much to say, because I am cot a
public speaker. I can only aay what comes
from the heart. I did not know I was to ad
dress ycu and therefore I can only talk what
you would all like to hear, and that U to give
you a good sound Republican talk.
Gentlemen, 1 have been honored with thÂ«
ereatent honor that can be conferred by you
people, because you are a part and parcel of
the voters of San Francisco and your voices
and your votes will have sreat weight in de
ciding the future of San Francisco.
San Francisco, gentlemen. Is the greatest
cosmopolitan city on this continent. San Fran
cisco has welcomed to her shores you and your
fathers before you. She has Invited people
from all parts of the world to be her dwellers.
And San Francisco has allowed them home
things that some countries don't allow tuem.
It has allowed them freedom of speech, fre-dom
of thought and freedom of the press. The re
sult Is what I see before me to-night. Tou
have banded yourselves together for your own
mutual benefit, for the benefit of your
and for the benefit of your own Ideas. But you
have gone further, you have organized your
selves together to discuss that which is of
great Interest to yourselves as dwellers In
our mldÂ«t and of great Interest to the future of
this city. We have our quarters. We have the
French, the Italian and the Greek nations and
we know that these people who have left tLelr
sunny homes and have come to dwell among our
people have come because they are the most pro
gressive people of their nativity. They have
come here because of what we can do for them
and for what they can do for themselves. (Ap
plause.) They are among the best people tn
our community, and I refer particularly to this
assemblage, because you are the best savers
and because you use this money -to bring your
friends to our beautiful city. I know what you
are going to say when you send your Invita
tions back to the mother country. You are go-
Ing to say to your friends that we are going
to have a new city out here, new streets, new
sewers, new schoolhouses where we are going
to rive our children lessons In the American
tongue â they will learn their own tongue at
home â and every school Is free alike to the

Hip! Hip! Hurrah! the Examiner circus
has arrived!
Plan Kindergarten Entertainment.
An entertainment for the benefit of the
Buford Kindergarten will be given at
Masonic Hall, South San Francisco, on
October 16. All the teachers and many
of the pupils of the school during the last
twelve years will be present and will con
tribute to the programme.
The Examiner is a whole circus in itself.
It combines the feats of "carrying water
on both shoulders," "dancing on two slack
wires" at the same time, executing a buck
and wing to the music of Gavin McNab,
"the avowed enemy of labor," and, like
the bedecked clown, gives advice that It
knows Is only a huge joke.
The programme of a circus is to amuse
and create laughter; there Is nothing in
it. Barnum, the "prince of humbugs,"
was the most successful circus 'manager
of the age and he said that the "people
like to be fooled." The Examiner is en
gaged in the same kind of work. It Is
trying to "fool the people."
It. does not require any amount of an
alysis to prove that the Examiner is In
the circus business. One has but to read
its editorials' of the present time and then
look over the flies of the Examiner of
the past few years. Its exhibition of
"back tumbling" is the most marvelous
and thrilling ever known In "circus his
tory."
INCONSISTENT ATTITUDE.
As Inconsistent as are the present edi
torials of the Examiner and its political
policy, so are its attacks on certain of
the Republican candidates. The Ex
aminer is an adept in the art of "mud
slinging" and It has not lost Its cunning.
Let the people of San Francisco judge
for themselves as to the sincerity of the
Examiner in Its support of the Demo
cratic nominees for election and its at
tacks on certain Republican candidates.
In a full-page editorial yesterday, en
titled "A Ticket Deserving of Public
Confidence," the Examiner said:
"The Democratic ticket la headed
by Franklin K. Lane an It* candi
date for Mayor. â¢ â¢ â¢ Mr. Lane
la nominated at a time when the
city need* n trained official at its
head. A conspiracy in on foot to
tarn the city over to the corpora
tions and the politician* to be rob
bed. The corporation* want frail
chlaen. The politician* want the
plunder that can be pot by aelllnir
-franchlaea and collecting- toll from
vice and crime. To prevent this plot
from belnK carried ont the city
need* In the Mayor'* chair a man
who ban had Ions political expe
rience and known the powera of hia
office. Mr. Lane la that man, and
the people of San Frandnco are for
tunate that they have the chance to
get him."
REFUSED LANE SUPPORT.
Contrast this utterance with one made
by the Examiner on September 3, 1902,
when Lane was /seeking the nomination
for Governor on tlie Democratic ticket:
"Mr. Lane has been for months
and Is now the personal candidate
of Gnvln McXab. McNab 1* the
avowed enemy of labor unions. The
KzamLner in the friend of organ
ised labor and therefore will not.
â¢npport .Mr. Franklin K. Lame If he
ia nominated."
It will, be noticed that the Examiner,
referring to Mr. Lane in yesterday's
editorial, says of him: "The people of
San Franlcsco are fortunate that they
have the chance to get him."
Now the Examiner well knows that
Lane Is the nominee of Gavin McNab,
the Democratic boss. McNab nominated
Lane for Governor last year, and also
selected him as the standard bearer : of
his party for Mayor in the coming elec
tion.
Gavin McNab is "the avowed enemy of
labor," according to the Examiner.- The
Examiner on September 2 of last year
said:
"The continuance of the McNab
THE Examiner's present political
attitude Is far more amusing
than anything that was to be
found In the ranks of the clrcu3
that recently visited San Fran
cisco.
Compare the statement of the Examiner
of yesterday that' District Attorney By
ington had "proved himself worthy of
trust" and that "he has earned a re-elec
tion" to what the Examiner said of By
lngton In an editorial on February 23,
1901. Under the , heading, "Will the Dis-
BYINGTON IS ATTACKED.
"Chief Sullivan confeane* that the
Mayor, himaelf. the Police Cominlv
nioner*. the District Attorney and
three of the Police Jndaren arranged
to licenae crime In Chinatown and
thus commit a felony under the
Penal Code, and .that the ;arrange
ment would have been carried out
if It had not been for the Exam
iner."
Let the Intelligent voters of San Fran
cisco contrast the statement of the Ex
aminer made yesterday on Bylngton to
pome of Its previous views on the District
Attorney. .
When the Examiner was making a
daily attack on the late Chief of Police
Sullivan regarding the existence of gam
bling in Chinatown, this is what the Ex
aminer said on February 6, 1901:
The Examiner has not always claimed
that District Attorney Bylngton "proved
himself worthy of trust" and that "he
has earned a re-election."
As a matter of fact, the Examiner has
time and time again accused Bylngton of
dereliction of duty and even went so far
aa to accuse him of being a party to a
plan to commit a felony.
"The office of District Attorney I*
Important to the people of San
Francisco. Without the District At
torney no criminal can be pro*e
cnted. A blind Dlatrlct Attorney
can permit public Jnatlce to be de
frauded; an energetic and honeat
Dlatrlct Attorney can make the law
a terror to rojarues. Lewi* F. HyinK
ton ha* nerved two term* in hi*
prenent poÂ«ltion, and no icandal has
attached to hi* oilloe. He ha* proved
hlinnelf to be a* worthy of trout In
thin ponltlon aa In that of Super
vlaor. In which he aerved before hia
elevation to hia preaent office. He
ha* earned a re-elctlon."
In Us editorial of yesterday entitled "A
Ticket Deserving of Public Confidence,"
the Examiner said:
LAUDATORY OF BYINGTON.
In urging the worklngmen and the
Union Labor party to vote against Lane
last year because he was the "personal
choice of Gavin McNab, the avowed
enemy of labor," and now beseeching the
same men to vote for Lane, certainly en
titles, the Examiner to the cap and bells
of the jester.
Dismissing for the time being the Ex
aminer's advocacy of I^ane, it will be In
teresting to note the attitude of the Ex
aminer to other Democratic candidates
for election.
Now the Examiner has advised the
"people" on two distinct occasions to do
absolutely contrary things.
Last year the Examiner advised the
labor unions not to support Franklin K.
Lane, as he was the "personal choice of
Gavin McNab, the avowed enemy of or
ganized labor."
A few days ago the Examiner, editori
ally, said of Lane's nomination:
"Where union la ntrenffth it i*
folly to divide." There ahonld be
the name union between the Demo
cratic party and the workinemen
an there la between the Republican
party and the trunta. For thla rea
Â¦on the Democratic party and the
Union Labor party ahould logically
be behind the name ticket."
ADVICE IS CONTRARY.

be awerved from it* fidelity to the

the political candidates who are
lined up with Gavin McXnb."
District Attorney, Denounced for Official Misconduct, Is
Declared to Be Worthy of Re-election.
THE EXAMINER'S CIRCUS.
The Examiner has demonstrated that It
"For nnother tnmtnnce, a fevr
month* njro the Dlntrlct Attorney
consented to pnt the prosecution of
the poolsellern In the hand* of a
man who wnÂ» repreaentinir at the
Â¦â¢nine time the cnnililem, the Chi

to see that thone who are srullty

pnntnhed. AVhleh aide will you

people!"
BYINGTON NEEDS PRODDING.
The Examiner claimed yesterday that
District Attorney Bylngton had "proved
himself worthy of trust" and that "he
has earned a re-election." The Examiner
did not think so of Bylngton on February
26. 1901, for on that date the Examiner
grilled Byington in a severe manner.
Under a caption four columns wide,
entitled "District Attorney Bylngton En
gaged, in Passing the Buck." the Exam
iner published a cartoon of the District
Attorney, labeled. "Pausing Between the
People and the Politicians.""
Bylngton was accused by the Examiner
of not doing his duty In prosecuting Chi
nese gamblers, and it repeated its edi
torial of February 23, 1901. .-â¢Â»i;.:_
The article accompanying the cartoon
was In the nature of an Interview with
Bylngton'on the editorial of February 23.
and each criticism of Bylngton was ac
companied by his explanation of the
charges. ' ,
The Examiner closed the article by say-
Ing: .
"From all of which It 1m easy to
Â¦ee that the District Attorney need*
more prodding? before he frill act
with vlsrorous innlatence. A Law
and. Order Leaarue may be neceÂ»Â«Â»r>"

the family home in Oakland. These de
tails will be attended to as rapidly as
possible. It is expected that the Masonic
organizations with which the dead pioneer
was affiliated will have charge of the
funeral in this city.
MASONS TAKE CHARGE
CF SPAULDING'S REMAINS
The matter was presented yesterday be
fore Judge Coffey and argued by ex-Judge
Dorn, who asked to have the power of the
executor, Guillermo Mack, suspended on
the ground that he had permanently re
moved from the State of California since
his appointment. .
Judg-e Coffey suspended the executor
and ordered a citation issued to Guillermo
â¢Mack, directing him to show cause why
the whole probate proceedings should not
be dismissed.
A novel legal proposition was presented
before Judge Coffey yesterday. It in
volves the status of a million-dollar es
tate in France, where an executor is only
entitled to hold an estate for one year and
one day. â¢
William Mack, who died In France in
lf-01, seavlng estates there and In Chile
valued at about $1,000,000, left a will con
taining the statement that he had been
naturalized as an American citizen In San
Francisco in 1851, and that therefore his
estate would have to be administered un
der American laws. His son, Guillermo
Mack, was left executor of the will.
It is cJalmed that Guillermo as executor
wished to hold the estate for a longer pe
riod than the law of France would allow,
and came to San Francisco from Paris
and offered the record and will for pro
bate here, and In order to give the court
jrrjsdictlon alleged that his father was a
resident here at the time of his death. It
is said that Guillermo also claimed to be
a resident of this city. On the testimony
given by Guillermo last April the will
was admitted to probate.
In order to get rid of the effect of the
will here the widow of William Mack,
who is still residing in France and who
is entitled to half the estate under the
will, employed Dorn & Dorn and Savage
of this city, who filed a petition to have
the probate proceedings set aside on the
ground that. William Mack left no estate
within the jurisdiction of the courts of
California and that he was not a resident
here at the time of his death.

year-old boy, who is accused of attempt
ing to > wreck a train on the California
Northwestern Railroad. <
As is customary on this *line, a freight
train was sent out ahead of to-day's pas
senger train. When the freight, which
was" proceeding slowly, reached. Bellevue
an obstruction was discovered on the
track. Investigation showed that a piece
of rail five feet long and weighing 100
pounds was tightly wedged In a. switch,
so that any train moving at good speed
would surely have been wrecked. Young
Hallio was arrested on suspicion. At first
he denied all knowledge of the matter,
but when closely questioned said that he
was carrying, the rail across the track
when it dropped and stuck fast In the
switch. â¢
Claim Is Made That He Tried to

YOUNG BOY IS ACCUSED
â¢ OF A SERIOUS CRIME
SAN JOSE, Oct. 9.â George W. Fay of
this city bears the distinction of having
been declared both legally dead and alive
by the courts. Several years ago he was
declared legally dead and his estate was
administered upon. Just when his heirs
were about to enjoy the estate Fay re
appeared and insisted he was still alive.
To-day Judge Lelb of the Superior Court
decided Fav was alive and entitled to
his estate. He was given judgment
against J. A. Co6ta, the administrator
of the estate, for $1500, the full value of
the property.
Fay left San Jose twelve years ago.
He was not heard from and his relatives
finally believed that he was dead. In the
meantime his grandfather, John Ash
worth, had died and left to him an estate
of $1500 in cash. At the end of seven
years Fay was- declared legally dead and
his estate ordered distributed. Letters of
administration were granted to J. , A.
Costa, whose application therefor was in
dorsed by Fay's sister. Mrs. Addle Fow
ler. Mrs. Fowler, who Is a sister of the
supposed dead man, was given her share
of $410. Before the rest of the estate
could be distributed Fay made his ap
pearance.
Fay demanded of Costa his full estate
of $1500, but Costa declined, holding that
in distributing: the estate he simply car
ried out the instructions of the court.
Costa offered to pay Fay the money
remaining In his hands, but the latter
refused. Suit then followed. Costa will
now have to make good the money he
paid Mrs. Fowler. The court held to
day that a live man's estate could not
be" administered upon, although he had
been declared legally dead.
Court Decides That Administrator
Must Make Restitution for Por
tion He Distributed.

GETS BACK HIS ESTATE
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9.â The citizens of
Ventura have won a victory over the
Southern Pacific, after a long tussle, and
the railroad is -coming around to their
terms. This means that beginning to
morrow the coast line limited, going
either way, will stop in that city. For
two months the merchants of the town
and the Southern Pacific have been at
loggerheads over the question. When the
limited first failed to stop, the business
men met and decided to ship all goods to
San Francisco by water and directed
northern jobbers to send them no mer
chandise by rail. The fight was taken *up
by the Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce In behalf of Ventura, which claims
the railroad has always discriminated
against it. Protests grew so loud that
last week the limited â¢ stopped a . few
times; then the order was. canceled and
the train flew through the town as before.
The Ventura committee prepared to go In
strength to San Francisco and beard the
Southern Pacific management. The rail
road men_evidently got wind" that head
quarters was to be stormed by the Indig
nant citizens, and accordingly directed
the coast limited to do their pleasure.
Southern Pacific Grants Demand That

CITIZENS OF VENTURA
WIN AFTER LONG FIGHT
OREGON jCITY, Oct. 9.â Attendants
employed at the State Insane asylum at
Salem were in the city to-day on the look
out for five escapes from that institution,
who broke out of the main building at an
early hour this morning. Among the es
capes is Oliver Marshall a convict pris
oner. Marshall was committed to the
State prison from Baker County under a
life sentence for murder and about three
years ago played crazy sufficiently well
to secure a transfer from the penitentiary
to the asylum for treatment. One of the
runaways was captured In the suburbs
ot Salem, but the other four are still at
large and the valley is being thoroughly
searched for them.
The escape from the asylum was ac
complished about 3 o'clock this morning.
With an improvised saw an opening was
made through the door m the ward in
which the quintet was confined and then
the lock was picked. It was an easy
matter to remove the screen from the
window. A rope was improvised of blank
ets, and with the aid of this the patients
safely dropped to the ground from a
third-story window. The break was dis
covered within an hour after the men had
left and a detail of attendants was
promptly sent in pursuit.
Among Them Is a Convict Committed
, to Oregon Prison for Life for
Murder.
FIVE INSANE PATIENTS
ESCAPE FROM AN ASYLUM
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 9.â Sheriff David
Reese and Deputy Sheriff William Lowell
this morning brought, from the peniten
tiary at Folsom Convicts James Murphy
and John H. Wood, notorious members
of the band of convicts which made a
break for liberty on July 27 last. Wood
and Murphy were captured at Reno, Nev.
They were brought here to undergo their
preliminary examination, there being
charges against them of murder for the
killing of Guard William L. Cotter, bur
glary for breaking Into the prison armory
and stealing arms and ammunition and
jatl breaking.
The prisoners said they were without
counsel when they were taken into court,
and they desired to have time in which
to employ a lawyer to represent them.
They thought they would be ready by 10
o'clock to-morrow morning, and the ex
amination was postponed until that time.

With these words George J. Moore, son
of a prominent family here, appealed to
Justice of the Peace ' F. S. Cone to-day
to be committed to prison that he might
be removed from the temptation of strong
drink, which, he said, was the, cause of
a!l the misery and sorrow to himself and
family. . . " . * . , ' . .
Moore, of his own motion, called at the
pclice station, Informed Detective George
R, Brown that he was a vagrant and de
slied.to be charged with vagrancy. Brow.i
accommodated him and a few minutes
Inter Moore was up before Justice Com
for sentence. After receiving It he was
conveyed by the detective to the County
Jail in Oakland, where he entered upon
his term .of imprisonment with satisfac
tion depicted upon his countenance.

ALAMEDA, Oct. 9.â "Send me to jail
until after Christmas, your Honor, so that
I will not be a nuisance to myself and
my parents. If I can only be kept away
from liquor for three months I believe It
will be the salvation of me."
That the threat of the Six Companies
was no idle boast was proven by the death
of the Interpreter. It was shortly after
3 o'clock when the shots were heard by
policemen in the street and an hour later
the body, pierced by three bullets, was
found. Many bullets went wide of fheir
mark and lodged in the wall. The high
binders intended that their Job should be
a good one and took their unfortunate
victim while he was seated at a table
enjoying his evening repast.
There is no clew as to who the mur
derers were. All day yesterday Detective
George McMahon gathered evidence, but
secured nothing conclusive from any one.
The murdered man had a very unsavory
reputation and his countrymen are not
anxious that the crime shall be vindi
cated. He murdered his uncle some years
ago in Spofford alley and was sentenced
to ten years in prison for the crime. He
was released but one year ago und since
has been a troublesome character in the
Chinese Quarter.
The vengeance of the heathen is marked
in the murder Thursday night of Yee Get
Tong, an interpreter. An edict, issued by
the powerful Six Companies, that no one
should assist in the defense of an ac
cused robber, was disregarded by Tong
and he paid the penalty with his life.
Because he Interpreted a circular that
had been posted throughout Chinatown
he called down the wrath of ihe powers
and gunmen riddled him with bullets
while he sat at dinner in his own home.
Yee Get Tong was aware that he should
die. Some days ago he stated that the
Six Companies was in possess'.on of the
knowledge of his disobedience and that
it was only a question of time until they
should satisfy their wrath in blood.
About two weeks ago the Six Companies
ordered that no Chinese should testify In
the defense of Woo Shuck, wha was im
plicated with two others in the robbery
of a store. There was considerable in
dignation expressed by the authorities at
this attempt on the part of the Chinese
to take the law in their own hands and
to lailroad a prisoner to the penitentiary.
It was stated that the accused had the
right of a defense and that those who
might be of assistance to him in proving
his innocence should not be intimidated
by any organization. Later it was said
that Tong had been responsible for the
trouble as he had given the interpretation
of the circular to the police.
The saloon man will teftify that Bush
rWl remarked soon after the occurrence
that "this was the first and last time he
would ever throw a lighted lamp at any
body." and the evidence against the ac
cused is strong. Bushnell cannot be
found, however, but the detectives are on
his trail.
When the lamp exploded Mrs. Bushnell
was r-nveloped in flames, which her father
extinguished with the aid of a blanket.
The latter then carried a burning rugr to
the street and went in search of a potice
officer. In the meantime Mrs. Francis
Tiedeman. who occupies the flat above
the Bushnells. came to the scene and
<-ared for the Injured woman until the ar
rival of an ambulance. While attending
the woman Mrs. Tiedeman claims that
t^he addressed her husband, saying:
"Well, Harry, you've done it at last."
Captain Martin again ordered an in- I
ouiry and Detective Cody found that theÂ«l
father of the dead woman. Patrick Ward, i
was present when the trouble took place, j
Ward fays that his daughter visited his i
home at 335 Fifteenth avenue early in the |
evening and later her husband came, j
After pome conversation Bushnell left j
and Ward and his daughter went to a j
liquor store at Seventh avenue and Clem- â¢
ent street, where they had several drinks. |
Soon afterward the three assembled at |
the Bushnel! home and hostilities began.
The liquor that had been consumed prob
ably played an important part in arous
ing the passions of the parties concerned j
and, according to Ward. Bushnell seized |
a coal oil lamp and. waving it over his j
h^ad. burled it at his wife. i
On September 11 there was a quarrel
between husband and wife and Mrs.
Bushnell was severely burned. When
taken to the hospital she made a state
ment that her husband had thrown a
lamp at her and was responsible for her
condition. The police started an inves- j
tigation. but allowed the matter to drop ;
when the patient contradicted her story j
end said that an explosion, for which no ;
one was rr-sponsible, had caused the ac- j
r ldent. Her condition grew worse daily j
and on Thursday she died.
Harry Bushnell, a laborer residing at
214 Seventh avenue, is being sought for
by the police and when captured probably
vill be charged with murder. According
to the evidence gathered by Detective
Charles Cody he hurled a lighted lamp at
his wife about a month ago and the wom
an died from the effects of the burns at |
the French Hospital last Thursday.
Sarah R. Llppold has begun suit against
Frank Lippold on the ground of cruelty.
She was formerly Sarah Bull andjmar
ried Lippold in jail. -Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦-, r. *
Mrs. Bessie Kelly, wife of Charles
Kelly, brought suit for divorce some time
ago, but to-day decided that she did not
want it. She telephoned to the County
Clerk to dismiss the action and. was told
that it had been already granted. As it is
an interlocutory decree and does not go
into effect for a year, she wanted the
Clerk to tell her "where she was at."
He referred her to her attorney.
Judge Ogden to-day denied Jose Aza
veda a divorce from Mary Azaveda and
also 'denied her petition for a separation.
He delivered them a lecture to the ef
fect that neither had sufflceint grounds
for the charges that they had made and
that the whole matter was more In the
nature of a quarrel. They came from San
Leandro and there were more, than sixty
witnesses in the case.
She lived with the W. F. Boardman
family In this cltyand became enamoured
of A. L. Sorenson, who was about to de
part for the Klondike. They were mar
ried by the Rev. Mr. Nelson in the pres
ence of friends, but as she did not wish
it to ' be generally known that she was
married, she gave the name of Ella
Smith to the marriage license clerk and
supposed thereby that she had invali
dated the marriage.
Sorenson did not return and a year or
so ago Mrs. Sorenson married Benjamin
Smith. Some time later she discovered
that she was not legally married, so she
secured aNdlvorce from Sorenson on the
ground of assertion. Still the defect in
her position before the law was not rem
edied and she then brought suit to annul
the marriage with her second husbond on
the ground that she was never legally
married to him. This view was taken to
day by Judge Ogden and he ordered a de
cree entered.
The case came up on a petition for an
annulment of the marriage of Mrs. Anna
Smith and Benjamin Smith. She claimed
that she had found out that she was not
legally married to him. as she, had not
gone to the formality of securing a di
vorce. The story would not sound so*
strange were it not for the fact that she
is a demure and retiring young woman,
who seemingly struggled around" In the
web of circumstances in which she had
become entangled and at each step be
came more Involved.
The giving -of a fictitious name at a
marriage ceremony by Anna Burlng In
1898 led to a peculiar - complication of
marital relations that took Judge Ogden
all the afternoon to untangle. After tak
ing two men for life partners she was
finally freed from both to-day by an
annulment of her second marriage upon
the ground that she was a married
woman at the time she made the con
tract.

The sad feature of the accident is that
Williams leaves a young bride of three
weeks, having been married September 15.
His wife was formerly Miss Adeline Biller

enacted at the University of California
this morning. Professor Eugene W. Hil
gard, dean of the college of agriculture
of the university, and one of the beat
known scientists in America, had the de
gree of "doctor of philosophy" conferred
upon him for the second time. Just fifty
years ago to-day the University of Heidel
berg conferred doctorate honors upon
Professor Hilgard. His native university
has remembered his distinguished fifty
years of service in the cause of science.
A new diploma, similar in every respect
to the one that Professor Hilgard got half
a century ago, had been forwarded to the
university to be presented to the vener
able scientist on the occasion of the fif
tieth anniversary of his mature scholar
ship.
Dr. Hilgard has been In the service of
the- university and the State since 1S75.
His associates In the faculty to-day took
the opportunity of showing, with Heidel
berg University, the respect in which they
held the man himself and his services
as a scientist. The entire faculty, garbed
in the conventional cap ana gown of their
academic office, attended the university
meeting. Professor Hilgard himself could
not be present on account of a slight ill
ness. President Wheeler paid a mag
nificent compliment to him. HÂ« sooke of
him as one of the scholars Â«t the old
school. President Wheeler said that when
Dr. Hilgard received word from Heidel
berg that the university would again con
fer upon him doctoAte honors he sat
down and wrote his response in scholarly
Latin. The students received the tributes
to Dean Hilgard with repeated applause.
The following were the resolutions
adopted by the Academic Council in honor
of Dr. Hilgards fiftieth anniversary as
a "doctor of philosophy":

The preliminary hearing of Mrs. Annie
Ross, charged with having been an ac
complice of Victor Walklrez, who la now
serving a lite sentence in San Quentln
foi tna murder of aged Mrs. Elizabeth
Leroy, was resumed to-day in Justice
Samuels' court.
In the forenoon Walkirez was again
placed on ti-e stand. His testimony was
much the same as that he gave "Wednes
day, being a contradiction of his former
confession of the murder. He claimed
that he was intoxicated at the time of
the murder and does not know how the
aged "woman came to her death. "Walklrez
says that Mrs. Ross frightened him into
confessing that he committed the deed,
his testimony implicating her in the
crime.
At the time of Walkirez's arrest Mrs.
Ross stated to the police that Walkirex
had killed Mrs. I^rov in her presence
by hitting her on the head with a ham
mer. To-day, on the testimony of the
autopsy surgeonsâ Dr. O. D. Hamilton.
Dr. J. M. Kane and Dr. C. E. Curdtsâ it
was shown that death was due to strang
ulation. Thfre was no fracture of the
skull.
Chief Hodgkins was called upon for a
repetition of his testimony in regard to
the conversation he had with Walkirez
immediately after the negro's arrest. He
also produced a number of letters from
Mrs. Ross to Walkirez while the mur
derer was In jail that the police had In
tercepted. The substance . of them was
that Mrs. Ross had written. Imploring
the negro to shield her. Eugene Van

NEW ADVEBTISEMENT&
A PESTIFEBOTJS GEBM
Burrows Up the Scalp Into Dandruff
and Saps the Hair's Vitality.
People who complain of falling hair as
a rule do not know that it is the result
of dandruff, which is caused by a pestif-
erous parasite burrowing up the scalp as
It digs down to the sheath In which tha
hair Is fed in the scalp. Before long tha
hair root is shriveled up and the hair
drops out. If the work of the germ 19
not destroyed hair keeps thinning till
baldness comes. The only way to euro
dandruff Â»s to 'kill the germ, and until
now there has been no hair preparation
that would do it; but to-day dandruff is
easily eradicated by Newbro's Herpicide,
which makes hair glossy and soft as silk.

GENERAL ASSOCIATION
CLOSES ANNUAL SESSION
Is 0^ HICAGO,'. Oct. 9.â John W. Gates,
(l^ whose name has been mentioned
UL^, in recent developments -as to the
underwriting of the United States
Shipbuilding Company, was in
terviewed to-day by the representative of
the Associated Press./ Referring 'to the
contract that- he says exists between his
house and the? house of J. P. Morgan &
Co., Gates said: . iff, '
There is no question about the contract with
Harris. Gates & Co. to sell the Morgan and
Schwab shipbuilding stock ahead of all others.
The contract was signed by Charles M. Schwab
for J. P. Morgan & Co. and CM. Schwab: by
Daniel Leroy .Dresser for the Trust Company cj:
the * 'Republic, Â¦ and by Lewis Nixon for the
United States Shipbuilding Company.
\. Morgan's name was not slgned'to the agree
ment. I presume that Mr. Dresser furnished
the copy. â¢ I saw it personally, but had nothing
to do with making it.
I was one of the unfortunate underwriters.
Under the terms of the contract tho Morgan
and Schwab stock was to be sold first and it
was further provided that the rest of the stock
should be locked up in a vault and kept until
the Morgan and Schwab stock was sold out.
They simply made a place to market the stock
ahead of Â¦â¢ another â if it has been possible to
market It â but there . was no market for the
r.took. â¢â Mr. Morgan acted, as I understand it,
in this whole transaction for the United States
Â«teel Syndicate, using the Bteel . syndicate's
money. I do not think Mr. Morgan will deny
that there was such - a deal. :' He claims that
thÂ»y were not the managers of the underwrit
ing syndicate, which is correct; he does not
sav they. were directly or indirectly interested.
In'lt. I see It Is reported that I was short of
this shipbuilding stock. I never sold short a
share of stock or bond. . I would be glad to. do
so Â¦ to-day - at a considerable sacrifice. . I con
sider the whole thing "much ado about noth
ing." c, - ;:%:; /Â¦-- - , Â¦' Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦ Â¦-Â¦, ;j-,;_
It is then /provided that the sale of the
Morgan . & . Co. stock and the Schwab
that the Trust Company of the Republic
and ' Lewis Nixon were to retain 85,000
shares of preferred and 135,000 shares of
common for "a term not less than one
year."
The agreement sets forth further that
one of the considerations and induce
ments by Â¦which- Nixon and Dresser de
livered the. stock of the Bethlehem Steel
Company and the funds tcpay for the
same was that 25.000 shares of j the pre
ferred stock and 25,000 shares of the com
mon, stock j be delivered- to J. P. Morgan
& Co. :-'._--:
None of the wounded it is believed. are
seriously hurt. A posse of prison guards
with several bloodhounds was promptly
started on the trail of the two escaped
convicts, but owing to darkness and the
wild nature of the country In the imme
diate vicinity of the prison no results are
looked for to-night. ,
The outbreak occurred about 6:30 p.m.,
just as the prisoners were being placed in
their cells for the night by Guards Wit
kins and Jacobs. The affair ..went through
with such vim and precision that it must
have been carefully planned beforehand.
Two of . the prisoners overpowered Wit
kins and Jacobs, the former- being shot
and slightly wounded "and the latter
frightfully beaten. The convicts took the
prison keys from the guards and released
five other prisoners who had already been
locked up. The seven prisoners then com."
pelled Guard Witkin*. notwithstanding
his injuries^ to march -at their head, and
with the assistance of ladders found near
the workshop proceeded to scale the wall.
Witkins was made to ascend first. As the
first convict reached the top Guard Nay
lor, who was on the south wall, opened
fire. This was the signal for a general
alarm, and several guards who were In
the office quickly seized their guns and
hastened to the scene. Guard Driggs
reached the wall Just as Dayton and Mul
len were descending on the outside. He
ordered them to halt,? but as they paid no
attention to the command he flred, killing
Dayton. A second shot struck Mullen in
the leg as he was coming down the lad
der, and he dropped to the ground, his
body falling over the, corpse of Dayton.
The other five convicts had succeeded In
reaching the ground outside the wall
when they were flred upon by other
guards. Abe Majors was shot iii the arm
and fell to the ground,- crying with pain.
Haworth was also shot and fell,- but
quickly arose and continued his flight.
Waddell was ehot In the leg. Lynch" es
caped uninjured, it is believed. After
running about 100 yards from. the .wall
Haworth dropped a rope made from
blankets, which was found stained with
blood. At the foot of the wall were found
seieral cartridges which the convicts
dropped as they came over. Two of the
prisoners ' were armed with revolvers.
Where they secured' the weapons is not
known. '
The escaped: Nick Haworth, sentenced
to death for the murder of Night Watch
man Sandall in Lay ton, Utah; James
Lynch, sentenced to death for the, murder
of Colonel Prowse In a gambling-house
In this "city three years ago.
SALT LAKE, Oct. 9â As a result
of a well organized ; and partly
euccessful attempt at a. wholesale
delivery of prisoners at the Utah
* State prison to-night one prisoner
was killed, one guard was shot and
wounded, another was beaten almost into
Insensibility, three prisoners were wound
ed and two others under death sentences
escaped." The dead:
FRANK DAYTON, serving a twelve
year term for attempted highway rob
bery.
The wounded: Guard Witkins, shot in
leg: Guard. Jacobs, badly beaten by con
victs; Convict Ed Mullen, serving a three

ll -^patents! IITiHE thriving city of Los Angeles is advancing
at a pace that must be pleasing to its enter
( * prising citizens. The Los Angeles Herald
sf -review of ' its progress'as. indicated- by the erection
oi buildings in the city in the first nine months of the
present yearJ Summarizing carefully prepared . offi
cial figures, it gives the total amount of money rep
resented by building improvements in the months in
dicated at $9,697,800. Large as is this total its sig
nificance is made to appear more clearly by compar
ing it with the total figures for the first three-quarters
of each of several preceding years. * V "< '';;â¢>;'
The total value of buildings erected in 1902 to the
Â« orresponding date was $6,378,643. The record; of
ro-ii Stands' at $2,703,894. The totals for these two
yeas; therefore fall $615,000 short of the record; for',
the present year. Taking a period of six years Â» to
gether, beginning with 1899, and the augmenting
progress of the City of tfye Angels makes, a strong
"showing: The total for the first nine months of 1899
was but $1,469,601; for the. same months in 1900 'the^
total was $1,688,542;, the for' 1901 are $2,703,
894; these for 1902 are; $6,378,643. The first : nine
months of 1903 prove that Los Angeles is 1 growing:
jjn value more than six times as fast as it was in^1899
and four times as rapidly, as in 1901.' These figures
are upheld by the general growth of Los Angeles and
arc- not due; to>the "erection of -a few exceptionally"
costly buildings in the- first three-quarters 'rofvj.903.';
This'is made clear by comparing the number of per
mits for the six years included 'iri the review instituted
by the Herald. : 1
. The number of permits . issued in the - first three
quartersi of 1899 was 1268; during the corresponding

; four times as" many- - buildings have Â»been erected
LOS ANGELES FORGES AHEAD.
FOREST fires in the mountains of California are
increasing' every year. They are laying bare
the mountain slopes and destroying the. storage
of' moisture. 1 Already the- effect is apparent, in, the
springs in'the foothills, which -were formerly very
numerous . and .ran .an 'abundance of water/ bur are
now affluent only -a part, 1 of the year.. and many are
entirely dry "at the" season' "when ;they-are 'most
needed; ;. . ,.â¢â¢.â¢'â¢Â¦Â¦'./'â¢'. - x - ',;. V; " ~~ ., . Â¦ '
Slowly but surely the consequences of carelessness
and .profligacy are appearing and the. moisture, the
mcther of the'-StatevSfruitfuhiess and 'fertility, .is de
clining. The people look on, but little impressed
because the whole consequences are not immediately
manifested.' In the lapse of time, however, the hourj
will come: when, they \are. all upon the State and it
will be too -late to repair ; the damage for; the .benefit
ofthe generation that'vvill suffer from it:. Â¦:
These 'fires originate ;in a variety of ways,*rtio%f'of
them being due. v to\the thoughtlessness of men. The
last great'one of the season^has just swepf'the.-e'ast-^
em slopes of Mount Shasta Â¦ destroying thousands of
acres of fine timber and impairing the effectiveness of,
a large watershed, -'this' fife is charged to cattle'
men, who are accused of setting it in order, to make
the" region impossible to ; goats and sheep next ;year.'.
This* Is hardly' credible, "since noije know better than*
the cattle men that forest fires do not drive out sheep
and goats, but are quite â¢ sure Â¦ to v render the fired, area,
less' desirable' for cattle ; pasture. '. -^ _,' v .-.

. Superintendent of Schools Langdon has
issued circulars to principals asking them
to co-operate in securing a fine exhibit
of school work at the St. Louis exposi
tion to be held next year. The circular
contains a list of instructions, the most
important of which is that all work must
be a faithful representation of the curri

stress on the results of manual training
which he considers appropriate in an ex

Independent voters and reflecting Democrats whose
judgment will lead them to support Mr. Crocker in
this fight will perceive the importance of electing
along with him a complete Republican administration.
By all means Mr. Crocker should have a Republican
Board of Supervisors to support him' in the work of
# his administration, and it is hardly less important that
the various executive and administrative offices be in
the hands of men who will cordially, co-operate with
the chiefs executive. The non-partisan and inde
pendent support given to Mr. Crocker may therefore
be reasonably expected to extend to the whole Re-
The ratification meeting to be held to-night affords
an opportunity for independents and for conservative
Democrats to come out and show themselves on the
right side. The reference to each successive election
as a crisis has become so hackneyed that fhc word has
well nigh lost its original significance, and yet every
thoughtful citizen must perceive that at this time we
are confronted by a real crisis in our local affairs. We
caimot go on in the old way. All the conditions of
the time impel to new things and the vote on the
bond issues for public improvements shows that the
masses of the people are eager to go forward. Under
such circumstances another term of factional govern
ment would be a serious evil to the community, while
an era of good government would materially promote
every interest of the city and advance every move
ment made, for municipal betterment..
These truths* are well understood by every man of
political intelligence. Another term of the Schmitz-
Rurf machine is not to be tolerated. Public interest
demands a business administration animitcd. by a gen
uine civic, patriotism. That will be the significance
of the grand demonstration with which Republican's,
independents and conservative. Democrats.-Kill',tb
night join in indorsing the candidacy of Henry JV
Crocker and of every, one of his colleagues on the Re
publican ticket.
The contest U v between the forces represented by
Mr. Crocker and his colleagues' and those represented
by the Schmitz-Ruef machine. That machine .has
been in power for one term and the result has been arr
administration so inefficient that the very m.en: who
direct it have been unable to agree and of late have
been charging one another with more offenses than
the conservative public ever suspected either faction
of committing. While the rival leaders have been
wrangling and denouncing one another as traitors to
this or that the affairs of the municipality have been
neglected, the revenues have been exhausted in the
payment of salaries, leaving but little for public work,
and that little has been largely misapplied. The con
servative element? of _ the people are resolved to put
an end to this condition of affairs. They wish prog
ress, prosperity and improvement and they are aware
that the first step in the direction of attaining. a
greater and a more beautiful San Francisco must be
taken by providing for an efficient city government
based upon business principles and conducted by
business men.
AT the Republican ratification meeting at the
Alhambra Theater this evening there will be
a demonstration of public rather than of party
fcentiment, for it is now evident that if San Francisco
is to be saved from the politicians who are trying
to bring about an era of class divisions among the
people there mrst be a general rally of good citizens
to the standard of Henry J. Crocker.
Of course the mere filling of an auditorium of the
size of that of, the Alhambra Theater would not be in
itself a proof that public sentiment is on the side of
the cause for which the meeting was held. A very
small minority of the voters of San Francisco could
fill the Alhambra to overflowing at a meeting held to
deal with almost any question of public interest. The
significance of the meeting will have to be sought in
the quality rather than in the numbers of the audi
ence. The meeting may be expected to be thor
oughly representative of the conservative sense of .the
people and a demonstration of the virtual unity in
support, of Mr. Crocker of all citizens who are op
posed to political parties organized on class lines.

i The Supreme 'Court declared yesterday
that Auditor Baehr must- make two cal
culations to account for the collection of
taxes for the next fiscal, year. One -of
these willbe^for funds to be used, by, the
city and comity, based on the assessment
approved by the Board of Supervisors and
the otheY for moneys to be eiven the
State based on the assessment made by
the Board, of Equalization. _ j â¢ .
D." J. Buckley, represented by Tomn Â«
Tobln, .petitioned the Supreme Court for
a writ of mandamus compelling the Audi
tor to consider only the assessment of the
State Board of Equalization In preparing
his accounts. B.\P. Oliver, represented,
by .Van Ness & Redman, asked for a writ
compelling the Auditor to make two cal
culations, one for city and county ex
penses based on the local assessment and
the otheriOr State purposes' based on the
Board of Equalization's assessment.
There was no difference in the alms of
the petitioners," but the two writs were
asked for in order that \ the Supreme
Court might grant one and deny the
other, and thus establish the legal status
of the -two assessments, was no
precedent- in the matter.' Furthermore,
therp existed considerable doubt as to the
construction to be placed upon the stat
utory and constitutional provisions which
refer to the. levying of' assessments. ;
If taxes had been collected on the as
sessment of the. State Board of Equaliza
tion San Francisco, would have had $1,250,-
Ooa.more than is necessary for the carry
ing on- of the municipal government Tne
Question was one of great interest to
heavy taxpayers and as a result It was
deemed wi3e to get, a clear, interpretation
of .the law fromÂ»the Supreme Court.
Auditor Baehr had commenced to make
one calculation . based on the assessment
of the Board of Equalization, j
The, decision means that the two assess
ments are. entirely Independent of each
Other and that the State board has power
to increase the tax rate only in respect
to what shall be paid for State expenses.

THE result of- the bond election which Was in
tended to burden the taxpayers with the street
'railroad business shows that the proposition
has lost rather than gained votes since it was first
submitted. Yet this last campaign, for it was mo r e
active and better organized than the first. There
can be no doubt that the friends of public ownership
polled their full strength and it is seen now to be a
small minority of the total vote of the city. . ;.,
We are aware that to this it may be answered that
the opponents also cast the vote of a still smaller
minority. Yet we are persuaded that that vote rep
resented, the views of. more people than the othe~.
Much**of<.the indifference was due to the fact that it
was felt that the proposition would be .beaten any
how arid it was not worth while to'ta.ke the time to'
hit it "with a ballot. Some thousands were also influ
enced by the belief that the bonds, if voted as pro
posed and made; a lien on the whole city, would not
stand the judicial- test and would, be invalidated j by
the courts. This view was powerfully influenced by
the letter of Mr. Crittenden Thornton, in .which he
declared the proposition to be unconstitutional. Con
fidence in htm as a lawyer, gave such a sense of secur-,.
ity as to influence many opponents' to snub the polls.
' In our view the city has escaped a great danger. - It
has refused to submit to theorists andÂ»enthusiasts the
trial of an experiment that would cost the taxpayers
by direct Hen about a million and a half of dollars.
We have characterize^ Jt as a proposition to em
bark in socialism because in Great. Britain the social
ists everywhere promote such experiments as the use
of the thin edge of the wedge, which is to' cleave ex
isting institutions and split the way to "universal col
lectivism. We desire, however/ to do the socialists
of this city the justice to say that they oppose such
piecemeal plan and propose that things shall not be
done' one nt a time. They dream of securing the
whole Government first and then at one coup ending,
the whole system -which they call capitalism by put
ting all human activities inthe hands of "the Govern
ment. This is why, as a body, the San "Francisco
socialists* did not fa,vor the Geary-street bonds. They
reasoned that such bonds would be sold to capitalists,
who would draw ' interest to the increase of their
wealth, and that the burden of interest would be
merely transferred from the users of the road to the
whole body of taxpayers. Had the same proposition
been submitted to British socialists they would have
favored.it upon the; theory that when all things are
held collectively the bonds themselves would be re
pudiated and destroyed and money would cease to be,
for there would be no further use for capital.
The Call, as the original and. for some time only
newspaper opponent of the proposition, is gratified
by the indorsement it has received. Our position that
bonds issued for public utilities of any kind shall rest
only on the plant to be created by. them is utterly un
assailable as a business proposition." In no other way
can the people have any assurance of an. honest and
businesslike administration of lines that have here-'
tofore been considered best left to private skill and
enterprise. The friends of public ownership contin
ually point to the profits and success of suchi enter
prises in private management as a reason why they
should be taken over to public ownership. "Surely it
is a reprehensible blindness to the facts that leads
them at the same time to reject the system under
which such success has been attained. How can a
city hope for the same success by. inextricably mixing
politics and business? â¢ "â..,,.,,. . .-.-.. . ..â¢Â¦'â¢â¢
It was not lost- upon wise observers that nearly
every old predatory politician in the city was in favor
of such a mix by making the bonds a lien upon the
taxpayer. Every politician that has tarred his hand
and thrust it into the treasury and drawn it out with
coin sticking to it was loud in advocacy of mixing
the- politics of city administration with the business
cf building and running a street railroad. If other
public. utility propositions are .submitted the same
men will be loudly in favor of the same plan. In the
future as in the past our advice to the taxpayers will
be to make all public utility bonds a lien only on the
plant they, create, leaving the general fund free for
use in promoting the essential purposes of govern
ment and putting no more burdens on the taxpayer.
If a public utility now pays in private ownership it
will pay also in public ownership, if that be the ob
ject of such ownership,! only when compelled to bear
its own cost and-the expense of its management. If
it will not pay it should be left in private hands and
not have its deficits put upon the taxpayer and con
cealed in the general levy.

A remarkable breach of promise suit
for the sum of $50,000 was filed at the
County Clerk's office yesterday afternoon
in behalf of Lavlna G. -Brown. The.de
fendant is F. H. Brown. The parties to
the suit were husband and wife until last
April, when the woman secured a divorce
from her husband on the ground of deser
tion. The custody of their two children
was awarded to her.
The divorce was granted April 3 and In
her complaint Mrs. Brown alleges that
on the same day her erstwhile husband
promised to wed her again. It Is declared
that they have lived as husband and -wife
until three weeks ago, when Brown be
came ill and was taken to St. Thomas
Hospital.
Back of it all is a peculiar story. It Is
alleged that Brown's marriage was deem
ed unfortunate by his father, a capitalist
of Kureka. and by his two sisters. It is
said that the son was Informed that he
could never get anything from the father
unless the former should secure a divorce.
The divorce was granted in April, Brown
8r. died In June and the son inherited
approximately (63,000.
Young Brown showed no intention of
remarrying: after the father waa laid
away and his former wife became Im
patient. The sisters came and talked
with the young man. but he remained
with Mrs. Brown and his children until
he became ill. It is alleged that he then
told his former wife that he could not
marry again. The breach of promise suit
is the result.
Brown pays $20 a month for the support
of the children. Mrs. Brown resides at
112 Fourth street. She will be represented
in the prospective litigation by Attorney

Mrs. Lauricella told her story on the
witness stand with some emotion. She
testified that she went to Costa's home
to take rare of his children and to at
tend to the household duties, Including
the cooking. She had never received any
compensation for her services, but Costa
entered into an agreement with her in
JSS7 that she was to have the free use of
the house during her lifetime and that in
the event of his death the propertj>**hould
go to her.
On February 1, 1903, Mrs. Lauricella tes
tified, Costa, on her agreement to marry
him, promised to give her the home In
consideration of love and affection. MrB.
Lauricella claims that she was willing at
any time to marry Costa, but he has re
fused to abide by his agreement.
The argument of the attorneys was sub
mitted on briefs, and after Judge Lawson
has Inquired into the authorities he will
render his decision.
Justice of the Peace LawBon notified
the attorneys in. the suit of Pedro Costa
against Mrs. Antonla I^aurlcella that he
would render his decision in the case next
Monday. The trial of the Bult, which has
been srolng on for some days, developed
quite an element of romance among two
members of ths local Italian colony.
Costa, who is a fisherman, sued Mrs.
Lauricella for possession of the prem
ises at 403 Greenwich street. His testi
mony was mainly to the effect that the
defendant' refused to vacate the premises,
although he had repeatedly requested her
to do so.
Mrs. Traverse says *her husband's in
come ranges from $175 to $300 a month
and she asks the court to compel him to
pay her alimony. She also claims that
when she married him she had about
32)00. and eays that he has spent it.

Arthur a Williams, a retired officer of
the United States navy. Is the defendant
In a suit for maintenance filed by his
wife. Alice Williams. She filed the suit
Tuesday, end yesterday she filed an af
fidavit !n which she avers that she has
been abandoned In a heartle33 and cruel
manner by her husband. The affidavit Is
filed la connection with a motion that
Williams be summoned by publication to
appear and defend himself against her
charges.
According to the affidavit, Mr. and Mrs.
Williams were married at Oakland In
1901. They established a home there, Wil
liams and his wife and her daughter by
a former marriage. After a few months
they went to a summer resort at Syl
vandale, where they remained for some
time. Then Mrs. Williams and her daugh
ter came to this city to select a home,
which they were to occupy at the close
of the summer season. Williams re
mained behind, the understanding being
that he should follow his wife and step
daughter within a few days. After her
arrival here Mrs. Williams received a
letter from her husband In which he stat
ed that he had received word from his
former home in North Carolina that his
mother was dangerously ill and that he
was about to leave for there In order to
?t-e her before she p&ssed away. He
would not be absent for more than two
weeks, he said In bis letter.
The two weeks passed and Mrs. Wil
liams received no further word from her
spouse. Fearing that something had hap
pened to him, she wrote to his former
home. Her letters wete returned un
opened. Then she communicated with of
ficials there and much to her surprise
learned that her husband's mother had
not been ill and that no evidence of his
whereabouts could be obtained, .this oc
curred last July, and since then Mrs. Wil
liams has been making a search for her
absent spouse, striving her best to drive
from her mind the suspicion that she had
been heartlessly abandoned.
Finally she learned that her husband
was in Tacoma; that he had gone there
from Sylvandale. Armed with this
knowledge, she instituted the proceedings
to compel him to support her. His pen
sion is $112 a month, and she asks the
court to award her $40 of this amount.

BERKELEY, Oct. 9.â Coach "Jim"
Whipple feels hurt at the way the
California varsity football men are
acting toward the game this year. In the
indifference the men show he sees ap
proaching disaster and he begs leave to
inform all persons interested that it will
be the players' fault if something dire
happens. Here is what the coach says
about the attitude of the team:
"I have never seen the varsity mf n dis
play such Indifference in their playing as
this yrar. In other years it has been a
fight for a place on the team from the
drop of the hat. Now they all take it
easy, probably because most of them
think their position is certain.
"Every man on the team is guilty of
this apathy.' The linemen do not seem
to care whether they break up a play be
fore It is started and the backs are slow
at starting. The second eleven and fresh
men show much more spirit and aggres
siveness than the varsity.
"The trouble with the varsity seems to
be there is too little competition and too
much confidence about winning the Inter
collegiate game. There are only one or
two places on the line for which there is
any contest and naturally the men who
have the places "cinched" don't care
much whether they break up a line or
not. Overcor.fldenec plays Its part In the
apathetic deportment of the men. too,
and the feeling that the intercollegiate
game is already won is having its effect."
The playing of the varsity this week
tends to corroborate Coach Whipple. It
is certain the team Is not making as many
gains agair.3t the second eleven as it
should. Such an aggregation of stars and
well-seasoned mm as the varsity eleven
contains should be able to blow the sec
ond e'.even off the field, but it doesn't.
It even has a hard time to hold* its own.
Most of last week's wounded got back
Into the fold again this week. Overall.
Stern. Boynton and Hudson have all re
covered and will play in the game to-day
against Reliance. "Johnny" More has ac
quired a lame leg, but It may not hurt
as much as he thinks when the same is
called this afternoon. The 51-0 game
against the Naval School last Saturday
did not do the varsity any good, as it
was too easy, but to-day will make up for
it. The line-up will probably be as fol
i lows:
Stow, center; Overall, right guard;
Stow, left guard; Hettmuller, right tackle;
Howard, left tackle; Hudson, right end;
Demeritt, left end; Graves, Muther, Ris
ley, Snedigar or Whipple, halfbacks;
Gearj'. quarter; Boynton or More, full
back.
The freshman team did exceptionally
well In the only game it played this week,
against Santa Clara. The latter sent a
team to Berkeley as fully equipped with
heavy men, brains and good coaching as
the freshmen, but could make no perma
nent gains. The freshmen held them on
the line and when they settled down to
business in the second half mowed that
red and white line down as easily as hay.
If the freshmen hadn't been weakened by
the withdrawal of all their best men in
the second half Santa Clara would not
have threatened the way she did toward
the end.
Kerns does most of the ground gaining
for the freshmen and if there were one
or two more backs like him there would
be no doubt about the intercollegiate
game. Kerns always hits the line hard
and the best of It is he knows just where
to hit It. McGinness has developed into a
good fighting end for the short time he
has been in the game and -is likely to
make the team. Gabriel is doing the right
thing as fullback and will be given a
place. The coaches arc trying so many
men for the other places and their talents
as so diversified that there Is no telling
which will be chosen. Prom the way
things are going in the freshman team
just now it seems Stanford is goin* to
hi.ve th'. hardest kind -of a time to win.
Players Are Indifferent, Feeling Assured of
Their Positions on the Team.
pTANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 9. â
The freshman team is the center of
O the interest on the Stanford gridiron
at present. Out of what sfemed at the
first of the season an abundance of first
class material the coaches have not been
e Me to develop a team that can defeat
a "prep" school eleven.
The youngsters have played two games
â¢with the Palo Alto Athletic Club elevenâ
an organization composed largely of
Talo Alto High School playersâ and one
with the Belmont School team and a se
ries cf three 5traight defeats resulted.
Not oniy were the '07 players beaten but
they were cleverly outclassed at nearly
every point of the game.
Apparently the coaches have a goodly
number of clever individual player?, but
v.-tien eleven of them are together there is
a noticeable lack of unity and strength of
ection. One difficulty seems to be that
the line men are rather light for their
positions. The backs, on the contrary,
are sufficiently heavy for a first-year
team and play an aggressive game.
Krrshman Stott. at quarterback, has
proved almost the equal of Captain Bans
bach at his position, and can be counted
on to do his share, not only as field gen
eral but also In the routine work of the
game. At catching and running In punt*
he is perhaps as clever a man as there
is on the gridiron, not excluding the
varsity candidate*.
BIjt "Jim" Woller has been moved from
tackle position back to fullback and is
putting up a strong game in his new posi
tion. He haÂ«= the fault of not going low
enough, however, when he trucks the line.
If he does not succeed In overcoming the
tendency to hit the line "straight up" he
cannot hope to i>rove effective as a full
back. Young Do!?, the freshman brother
of Varsity Halfback "Savage" Dole,
FÂ«-eras to have a "cinch" on one of the
halfback positions on the freshman
eleven. He is good at carrying the ball
and his ability to boot it will certainly
earn him a place on the *07 team. Stephen
eon, who has played fullback for the
freshmen during the greater part of the
season, is perhaps the grittiest and most
aggressive man among the youngsters,
but he Is light in weight for the position.
The fight for the other half will prob
ably narrow down to Brennan, Packard
snd Laumeister. with the men arranged
in the order of their chances for the po
sition. However, places on football
elevens are not infrequently won in the
last week's practice, and It is difficult to
prognosticate as to what the exact per
sonnel of the eleven will be when It
faces the Berkeley freshmen In San Fran
cisco a week from to-morrow.
The coachesâ particularly Head Coach
Lanaganâ are devoting the major part of
their time to the varsity squad, and the
results that their unremitting efforts are
bringing are extremely gratifying to the
rooters. Fumbling is a rarity these days.
Â¦ r.d when a ball does happen to be fum
bled the entire eleven players make a
dive for it. This results from the fact
that Lanagan has laid more stress on this
point of Tailing on a fumbled ball than
or any other thing In the game.
The men are playing the hardest kind
of ball, and yet there is hardly an In
jured man on the fieldâ a fact that speaks
well for the physical condition they are
In. Rivalry among the candidates Is ex
tiemely keen, and every player is put
ting- forth his best efforts. About the only
r/ic-n who can be considered as fixtures on
the big eleven are Captain Bansbach at
quarter, Center Hauverman and Left
Tackle Sprott. That the fighting spirit
hat> been thoroughly Instilled In the
varsity men is evident from the deter
mined way in which they tore through
the heavy Reliance team last Saturday.
To-morrow the varsity will play Us sec
ond game with the Pcnsacola team from
Gcat Island. In the first contest the
r.aval apprentices were defeated by the
score of 17 to 0. The California varsity

B. Kortlang, the Australian, expects to
leave for New York before the end of the
year and to play with one of the teams in
the Eastern States for two years. After
that he proposes to visit England and
then to return to his native . Australia.
With the possible exception of "Billy"
Robertson, also an Australian, of the old
Bohemian Cricket Club, B. Kortlang Is
the strongest all-round cricketer who has
resided in California during the last ten
or fifteen years.
The pennant emblematic of the cricket
championship of 1903 has been won by the
San Francisco County Club, which Is
clearly the strongest eleven in the State.
It is even doubtful whether an eleven
made up from all the rest of California
could make much headway against this
formidable team.
Although the regular schedule of
matches arranged by the California
Cricket Association 'for the season of
1903 was completed by the match played
last Sunday on the Alameda grounds be
tween the Pacific and San Francisco
County clubs, the cricketers are loth to
abandon their favorite game.
A match will be played to-morrow on
the grounds at Webster street. Alameda,
between the San Francisco County eleven
and a team drawn from the Alameda and
Pacific clubs and playing under the name
of the California Cricket Association.

CRICKETERS RELUCTANT
TO ABANDON THE GAME
While the ducks are here in unusual
numbers, the sportsmen are making un
usual preparations to give them a noisy
welcome. The dealers can hardly execute
their order* for hand loaded shells. It
seems there has been concerted action
among the gunmen to double their orders
of previous years.
Herman Oelrlchs heads the list with
an order for 6000 shells. Mr. Oelrichs is
the most prodieal of the duck shooters.
His preserve at CyRmus Station on the
Suisun marsh Is one of the nnest in Amer
ica, his shooting lodge being a model of
what such an establishment should be.
. Mr. Oelrichs entertains lavishly. He Is
prepared to supply his guests with guns,
ammunition, shootintT clothes and every
thing necessary for an enjoyable day
afield. Lucky is the man who receives
THE restraining hand of the law will
be raised on Thursday next, when
ducks and quail may be killed for
a period of four months. It is the con
sensus of opinion among sportsmen that
not in fifteen years have ducks been so
plentiful as at the present time. The
Suisun marsh is fairly carpeted with
these birds of beautiful plumage. The
same conditions prevail down Alvarado
way. The birds are all sleek and fat, the
natural result of an abundance of feed.
While many of these birds were un
doubtedly bred here It is not possible
that all were, so some of the northern
birds must have found their way here
already. This is borne out by the fact
that large numbers of the rudy duck
have arrived, an unusual circumstance at
this time of the year.
The California Club is in a more pros
perous condition than ever before. Mem
bers are coming in rapidly find the limit
â200â has almost been reached. Many im.
provements will be' made, both on , the
courts and on the buildings. It is the In
tention of the, directors, to hold/ many
tournaments during the winter. A tour
nament committee of ! active players has
been appointed, and it is probable there
will bo two tournaments a month. â¢ An
effort will . be made to Induce - the park
players to hold . their tournaments so as
not to conflict with those of the club.
The tennis players will be occupied to
morrow with the handicap singles tour
nament, which will commence on the
public courts in Golden Gate Park at 8:30
o'clock. The entry list Is the largest ever
heard of on the coast. .It Is doubtful if
there has ever been a tournament held' in
this country that has attracted a larger
number of players. ,,
It has been a difficult matter for the
tournament committee to arrange the
handicaps, as the number ]s so large and
many of the -'players are unknown and
consequently hard to handicap. . The
largest odds allowed are "30,". and the
most heavily handicapped players will be
placed "15 2-6" back of scratch. Four
players will compete from this mark.
They are J. D. MaqGavin, R. N. Whitney,
Will Allen and Grant Smith. It is doubt
ful if either MacGavin or Smith will play.
Many are of the opinion that Allen has
been too heavily handicapped and should
be on the "owe 5-6" . mark, with George
Baker. Clarence Griffin, Charles Dunlap
and Harry Routh are "2-6" ' back of
scratch. Nell Baker playing from scratch
undoubtedly has an excellent chance of
winning. \ ' . '

The ducks will get such a bombarding
during the first four days of the season
that many of them will probably be driven
south where citv sportsmen will cease
from troubling them.
The far-famed Stewart pond, near Sui
sun, which has afforded sensational sport
in years past, has been leased by a num
ber of enthusiastic sportsmen for this sea

area of GOO acres, although the shooting is
confined to about 200 acres. This includes
a splendid snipe patch.
an invitation to a day's shooting, but woe
betide him if, for any reason, he fails
to accent. He will never have another
opportunity.
There has been an unusual demand for
preserves this season, with the result that
prices have gone skyward until they have
almost touched city values. All the de
sirable lands on the Suisun, Alameda and
San Mateo County marshes have been
taken over by Pit her clubs or private indi
viduals, leaving but little shooting for the
unattached sportsmen. The San Mateo
marsh will attract many of the latter
this year, the cars of the electric road
making it so readily accessible. Ponds
have been built and the shooting is ex
pected to prove much better than in re
cont years. The Sonoma marsh, over
which the Alameda Gun Club shoots, has
its cuota of birds.
.Three of the matches are. expected to
prove exceptionally close. Dr.. Hamilton
has Improved so rapidly of late and has
shown such skill In both his matches th;**
he . Is considered to have Â¦. an excellent
chance against Gray. Moffat and Crowe
are two . other players of almost equal
skill. It would be a difficult matter to
pick the winner of the Cook-Eaton match.
Craig, McNaught, Barr, Forgie and Mc-
Laren are expected to win their matches.
The players are becoming so numerous
at the park that the green on Saturday
afternoon is not nearly able to accommo
date all of them. It is. necessary to take
turns, and most of the practice matches
are In doubles, and In some cases it has
become necessary to have six players on
each ; rink. V When . the game was In

Two .rounds of the Scottish bowling
tournament,-, which has been in progress
for nearly two months on the Golden Gate

probably half of the eight matches will
be played. There are but two days al
lowed in which to finish this round. The
fourth round will commence on the 18th
inst. and will close on the 31st.
From now on the matches should all be
close, as the poorer players have been
weeded out and the remainder are in most
cases evenly matched. Thomas McNaught
in the upper half and John McLaren in
the lower half, are considered the strong
est players. Barring accident one of these
men should carry off first honors. The

Small Attendance Witnesses
an Interesting Game at
the Recreation Ball Park
THE home ball toBsers slipped the
double cross to the Angels so
quickly yesterday afternoon, at
Recreation .'Park, that half the twenty- ;
five people In the lot became so amazed
that they went home. Anyhow, it was
a swell game of ball, and the magnificent
pitching of Ham Iberg kept the Angels
at a distance from the rubber. They never
had a chance to get beyond the third
cushion. Score 3 to 0.
"Dolly" Gray was there a few himself,
but his work did not come up to the
standard of Ham's in any particular.
Time and time again did the giants from
the south make desperate efforts to
squeeze a run over the plate, but they
always failed at the last minute.
The home tossers opened up in the third
inning. With two out. Ham drove a
single over second. He stole and Shay
walked. A rap by lleany to the center
garden brought Iberg over the Jumps.
He would have been stopped at the plate,
only Eaear dropped the ball.
' Twice more did they land in the sixth.
Meany hit and stole and Leahy sent him
â¢to third with one that went to slow for
the infielders to handle. Pabst chased
Meany to the front with a drive to the
outfield and an out put Leahy over with
the last one. The score:
San Francisco â â¢ Lob Angeles â

HIGH SCHOOL TEAMS
PLAY AT FOOTBAXL
Polytechnic Eleven Defeats Lowell
Team in a Ragged Exhibition -
of the Sport.
There were two fist -fights, many dis
putes and a game of puss-ln-the-corner
out at the Presidio Athletic grounds yes
terday afternoon between twenty-two
young men representing the Lowell and
Polytechnic High Schools.
At the end they said Polytechnic de
feated Lowell In a football game by the
score of 23 to 0. Those spectators who
could see above the hundred odd heads
which crowded the field had not followed
the scoreâ It piled up to rapidly.
The Polytechnic team simply walked
away with the Lowell youths, circling
their ends for twenty yards at leisure
and ploughing through a. scattered field
at will. So weak was the Lowell aggre
gation that the real strength of their op
ponents could not be developed. To say
the best for Lowell, their strength was
materially decreased' by the absence of
Hamilton, their crack player, who is
eschewing the gridiron for the cinder
path.
The lineup "was as follows:

THE HEAVY TEAMSTERS
Excellent Programme Is Arranged
for Last Night of Tug-of-War
Tournament.
The teamsters, who in the first part of
the tug-of-war tournament that is being
held at Central Park were looked upon
as Invincible, met with defeat again last
night. On the previous evening the long
shore lumbermen dragged them over the
winning mark after a hard struggle of
more than twenty-two minutes. The up
set seemed to dishearten the drivers, and
in going against the well trained carpen
ters suffered a defeat in short order.
The contest lasted four minutes and
forty-nine seconds. During the better part
of the time there was little headway
made, but suddenly the carpenters gained
a cleat and kept their winning streak un
til they gained the decision. To add to
tho defeat of the teamsters, the carpen
ters kept them from gaining a single cleat
during the trialâ a new experience for the
one-time heavily backed aspirants for top
honors.
The bridge workers outpulled the plumb
ers in nine minutes, and the longshore
lumbermen won from tho carmen In 4:50.
The tournament ends to-night Follow
ing is the programme as arranged: Horse
shocrs vs. cement workers, teamsters vs.
plasterers, plumbers vs.- bricklayers, car
men vs. bridgeworkers, carpenters vs.
lumbermen. The last named teams have
won every trial that they have partici
pated In, and a grand contest is looked
for between them.

Although the summer visitors to San

throughout the winter. At present the
course is hard from lack of moisture, but
the first rain will put it into good con

The golfers of San Francisco are awak

practicing on the Presidio course. The
Early Morning tournament, consisting of
five rounds of nine holes, to be played be
fore 9 o'clock in the morning, ends to

James Braid, the famous British pro
fessional; J. A. T. Bramston and Horace
Hutchinson, amateurs, are the chief con
tributors to the last new book on golf,
which contains much valuable matter.
Both Braid and J. A. T. Bramston draw
epecial attention to the Important work
of the wrists in long driving. Braid gives
advice as to how to give an intentional
slice or pull to a ball, but this advice ia
only useful to excellent golfers. J. A. T.
Bramston points out that the palms of
the hands must not be permitted to do the
work that should be done by the fingers
in gripping the shaft, since this deprives
the wrists of the essential freedom of ac
tion.
IN the mixed foursomes played last Sat
urday on the links of the San Rafael
Golf Club M. J. and Mrs. Casey won
the trophy, with a score of 64 less 17, net

KOBTLANG IS FIRST
AMONG THE CRICKETERS
JIM FOX was the chief dispenser of,
punches in the main event of the Lin
coln Athletic Club's show last night
In Mechanics' Pavilion annex. For- four
rounds he hammered big Bill Johnson,
the butcher lad. till the latter's face wai
a dream to look upon. The remainder of
the programme, with the exception of
one or two mlxups. was full of action
and pleased the large attendance.
Johnson started off well In the initial
round, but he soon lost his lead. Fox
began to use a straight left to the face
In the second. This stopped the butcher
from doing any more damage for awhile.
He soon began to grow desperate and
would invariably rush his opponent. land-
Ing a punch when he could and taking
ten jabs for the privilege.
Fox had many opportunities to put his
man away for the count, but he did not
seem to know about any punch but the
straight left. Many times he could have
ended the fight with a good swing when
Johnson was wobbly, but he never came
through at the right time.
Johnson came in at the opening of the
fourth round with the evident Intention of
stopping his man. For the full three min
utes the pair exchanged rights and lefts
to every part of the head and body. Botb
were weak and neither had a good blow
left. The Judges awarded the palm of
victory to Fox.
Al Elkins and Wesley Badger furnished
the other headline attraction on the card
and it was a poor one Indeed. ElklnJ
lacked his usual steam and his opponent
did not know enough about the game to
beat a schoolboy. Finally Elkins took a
brace and finished his man with a ter
rific right on the jaw in the last round.
Joe Podesta made Jack Mortality quit
In the third round of their meeting. The
fight looked like a fake from the first
round on and the spectators hissed loudly.
Harry Fallen was given an unjust decis
ion over George Murdock In a weird sort
of a battle, in which both men rolled and
tumbled about the arena. William Friel
got the decision over George Robinson,
and Jack O'Brien outpointed Jim Daly.

FERRY STEAMER EXCINAL
AND THE COLUMBIA IN
CLOSE QUARTERS.
rolla Is quoted at 85, the Loch Ix>ng at 70 a:
the St. Mungo and Catharina at 20 per cent.
The etJff southeaster that was blowing
â¢during ihe morr.ing was at Its height
ebout 31 o'clock and for several hours
passengers on all the ferry-boats got a
â¢realistic taste of ocean travel. At the
Alaraeda mole the Inadequacy of the side
landing arrangement was uncomfortably
evident. The railroad-iron counter-weights
and the roughly constructed gangways
were jarred and joggled by the pitching
boats until the boarding cf them was
:ike a trip through a disorganized infernal
machine and required more nerve than
some of the commuters had with them.
There were no accidents, however, and
.the sÂ»>a went down as the day wore on.
Tugboats were kept busy all day mov
ing vessels to safer anchorages and in a
few cases dragging anchors resulted in
damage. The big four-masted schooner
Marconi drifted down on the ship Star
of-It?ly and sustained considerable dam
age. The ship escaped with the loss of a
little paint.
The Columbia, with the right of way
and her pilot apparently as innocent of
knowledge of the ferry-boat's prox
imity as was the ferry-boat pilot of the
fact that his course to his slip was any
thing but clear, held on her course. Not
a. whistle was blown by either boat. The
Ertcinal was finally stopped and backed,
end as the Columbia swept by within a
couple of yards of thÂ« Encinal's forward
guard the spray from the river steamer's
big etern whÂ«l splashed the -frightened
passengers, standing In speechless terror
on the ferry-boat's decks.
the vessels approach each other
t-hat disaster peemed inevitable and the
passengers on the Southern Pacific boat
were thrown ir.to & panic. The Enclnal,
en her 10:35 a. m. trip, was heading for
her slip at this elde of the bay. She was
about fifteen minutes late and Captain
Kcgers was apparently anxious not to
lcse any more time. When about half
way between Goat Island and the ferry
depot, the Columbia, also headed for this
eide, but steering a course more souther-
Jy than the Encinal and leading directly
across the ferry-boat's bow, loomed up
ahead of the. Enclnal. The Columbia, un
der the rules of the road, had the right of
v.ay. Although the wind was blowing
stiffly from the southeast and the ferry
boat laboring considerably. It waa per
fectly clear, but the Knclnal'st pilot failed
to observe the river eteamer until she
was "almost under the Encinal's bluff bow.

Mrs. Babcock's Will Is Filed.
Mrs. Lovinia Raemsch, 131 Taylor street,
has sworn to a complaint charging J. M.
Evana of 116 Eddy street with selling in
cumbered property. She alleges that on
August 31 she purchased from Evans the
furniture in the house at 131 Taylor street
for $675, and noihing was said to her
about any incumbrance. She has now dis
covered that Evans originally purchased
the 'furniture on the installment plan, and
there was still a mortgage on it to the
furniture company for $200. Evans in
stalled Mamei Barry in the house, and
he gave her the furniture, but later
she gave him a bill of sale on part of It.
Â¦Evans was arrested about three months
ago for battery upon Mamie Barry and
her mother. He was convicted by Police
Judge Fritz on both charges and was
fined $100 In one case and $50 in the other.

TO ARREST FOR FELONY
Wai J. Tuska, the weir known attor
ney; Clara Tuska, his wife, and "W. C.
Bruson are the defendants in a sensa
tional suit filed in the Superior
Court yesterday by John G. Schwalm.
The suit is to recover 1700, with
interest from November, 1899. The
money Is alleged to have been procured
by the defendants from the plaintiff by
means of fraudulent misrepresentation.
According to the complaint, Tuska and
his wife in November, 1899, told the plain
tiff that they had an enterprise In which
he could Invest considerable money with
profit to himself.' They told him, he says,
that the Electric Iron and Steel Com
pany was a concern doing a profitable
business and that they were in a posi
tion tn secure for him some of its stock
at "inside bedrock prices," and advised
him to make the ve'nture. They told him
at that time, he complains, that the stock
was selling for only $25 a share and that
it would only be a matter of a few days
when it would jump $100.
He was told, he .charges, by Mrs. Tuska,
in the presence of her. husband, that she
considered the Investment such a good
one that she had disposed of consider
able of her Jewelry and Invested the pro
ceeds in the stock. He says they repre
sented to him that the stock would short
ly be paying a dividend of 15 per cent.
Because of these representations ha
claims he Invested $700 In the concern,
receiving in exchange a certificate for
thirty-two shares of stock.
Now he wants his money back, for he
says he has iqpt received a cent in the
way of dividends. He says that his $700
was divided by the Tuskas and the other
defendant, Bruson, and that, though he
has. made freauent demands upon them
for the return of his money, they refuse
to give it up.
Judge de Haven found aJso that the
master should have put in for repairs at
the Falkland Islands, and for neglecting
to do so the Bhip was liable for damages.
The court was of the opinion that prob
ably the greater part of the whole damage
sustained by the cargo was caused by
perils of the sea before the vessel had
changed her course at Cape Horn and
sailed for Australia. The damage was di
vided and Judgment was given for the
llbelant for one-half of, the damage sus
tained by the cargt), with interest and
costs. The llbelant is not- entitled to re
cover for that part of the cargo that was
Jettisoned.
United States Commissioner George E.
Morse was appointed to estimate and re
port upon the amount of damages.
The, complaint alleged that the cargo
had been Improperly and carelessly â¢fetowed
between decks in such a manner as to
strain the vessel and open her seams, thus
letting in the sea water. Fifty tons were
jettisoned in a siorm. In his decision
Judge de Haven said among other things:
Stowage with the view oÂ£ the proper trim of
the vessel and the ease with which It will
be able to carry Its cargo when at sea Is a
matter which calls for the Judgment of those
under whose supervision it is done. The car
rier is only required to exercise reasonable
care and skill In stowing: cargo. In order to
establish euch negligence as l.i claimed here the
disproportion between the amount stowed in
the hold and that placed between decks must
be so treat as to warrant the conclusion that
reasonable Judgment was not used in loading
the vessel, and I am not satisfied from the evi
dence that such great disproportion existed In
this case.
United States District Judere de Haven
yesterday handed j own an opinion In the
libel of J. D. Spreckels & Bros. Company
against the ship Musselcrag to recover

Your Trip East
Perhaps you came from the East
and are now planning to go back. If
you came over our line you know how
good the service is, the comfort and
convenience of oar tourist Bleeping
cars, and how our. special conductor
assisted in making the trip easy and
interesting.
WHY NOT GO BACK
WITH US?
I am here to arrange all the details
for you. We have tourist parties
which leave for Chicago, St. Louis
and Boston every- week by way of
Salt Lake City, through glorious
Colorado by daylight and via Denver.
You can stop over at interesting places
if you wish, as one of the excursions
has been so arranged.
Kindly drop me a line, saying just
when you are going and what you would
likÂ£ to do, and I will see that you are
thoroughly posted. Then, if you wish,
I will reserve a sleeping berth for you
and see that you are comfortably
started on your journey.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Foreign'futures were higher. Chi
cago reported that foreign markets were not
much Â¦ affected by the,' Russian-Japanese situ
ation. The weak feature at Chicago was the
small ; export Â¦ demand. Bradstreet's gave. ' the
exports for the week.- Flour included at 2 -
278,000 bushels. ',
The Chicago letter of Bolton, De Ruyter &
Co. said: "Foreign 'markets show Indifference
to any otrength here, and Broomhall ' cables
that the Liverpool market j. Is still depressed
by large Russian and Indian offerings and fine
crop prospects In Argentina. Export clear
ances for the week were about 2,800,000. Last
X c Jt^ Â£?> wei ? ex PÂ° rtin K at the raÂ£e of about
5,000,000 bushels per week. Primary receipts
are slightly less than a year ago. This is to
some extent accounted for by the unfavorable
weather. In the Northwest. At the present
rate of accumulation and movement it looks
as if the visible .supply balance of this year
would Increase more -rapidly than last. There
seems a probability that the Minneapolis mills
will settle the strike this afternoon. They re
port a fairly good demand for Flour, with but
little for. export. "- There is. also a rather alack
Â» demand reported : by 'the Interior : and South
western mills. ' On .the theory that American
markets cannot, long etand on 'an independent
basis and out < of line with the . importing de
mand of other countries "^-e see little that Is
bullish In â¢ the " situation on â¢ Wheat.' Minne
apolis is supported by local speculative j con
ditions, based on the small arrivals of con
tract' Wheat.- Of course the poor Wheat: will
move from, the farms soon. St. Louis is sup
ported out of .line by. strong manipulation and
as. of course, contract .Wheat ,1s" practically
of the same "grade, that tends to support .'us.-

iSunda^.1 ; "' ,-. : : :' â¢. /Â¦Â¦-*- ,/Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦
Jhis beautiful picture is the work of the
emirieht German artist, Adolph Schreyer, and
is called "The Arab Scout." ;
â¢'::.â¢--:; .. Â¦Â¦Â¦.- : - Â¦ t-.v , - ; , , : -.. ' â¢
THE ARAB SCOUT.
This title, which has been given to many of the pictures of Al-
gerian horsemen painted bv Adolph Schreyer, was never better a0-
plied than to the one which furnishes the subject of The Call Art
Supplement. .Â» .
. : â¢ The alert and cautious attitude 'of the rider and the careful man-
ner in which the horse is snown picking. his way through a trackless
waste suggest forcibly that they are on uncertain ground, where un- Â¦
| seen < foes may be met at any moment. ' i
- - Schreyer was a romanticist. T He seemed to recard the horse with
much the same love and respect that the Arabs bestow upon what they
consider J God's most orecious gift to man.
. I He also surrounded the Arab a glamour of romance. The
free adventure of Iheir nomadic lives, their skill in horsemanship and
the use of firearms, the wealth of color and ornament * in their .cos-
tumes and trappines for their steeds are dwelt upon .in his pictures
.with a fond attention which indicates an absorbing interest in them.
Few painters have adhered to a class of subjectsâ one might say
a single subjectâ as closely as Schreyer.
\' - . In. his early life he painted some scenes in which Wallachian team-
sters or field artillery of various armies played a prominent part, but
when he had once become familiar with Arabs and th'eir horses he
rarely attempted to paint other subiects.
Adolph Schreyer was born in Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1828. He
studied drawing in the StadeP Institute in that city and studied horse3
in' a riding school. Later he pursued his art studies in Stuttgart.
Munich and Dusseldorf.
,- : In 1848 he traveled throueh Hungary,' Wallachia and the land of
the -Cossacks with Jhe Prince of.Thurn and Taxis.
He accompanie'd the Austrian army on its march through' the
Danubian provinces in 1854? and in 1856 traveled through Syria and
Egypt. . '
In 1861 he visited Aleiers. and from that year until 1870 he re-
sided in Paris. In that vear he went to Kronberg. near Frankfort,
and until his death he divided his time between that place and Pari3.
He received honors in; many European exhibitions and is repre>
sented in many public galleries. He was a member of the Academies
of Antwerp "and Rotterdam: was court painter to/the Grand Duke of
Mecklenburtr: was chevalier of the Order of Leopold. ' I
:/. In-America his work has been immensely popular. Scarcely a
public or private collection of any importance is without one or sev-
eral of his paintings. Â». .' 1

Keating made a subsequent visit, and
later handed down his secret to a British
er, Fitzgerald by 'name, who in, turn
passed the information along to Rear Ad
miral Henry St. Leger Bury Palliser, then
commanding. the British squadron in the
Pacific. On his flagship, the Imperieuse.
the gallant admiral made rapid tracks for
the golden. prize. He landed 300 bluejack
ets at Cocos and satisfied himself, it is
said,' that his information was of value.
., The' Costa Rican Government objected
to Admiral Palliser Â» landing armed men
on Costa' Rlcan territory without permis
sion: ' Complaint 'was ' made ' to England
and the admiral ] was '. promptly retired
from the service. - : . .
Â¦With the treasure fever burning fiercely
In his .veins, 'the "old sailor t set about the
organization of an expedition to get that
gold. ' He formed" a Cocbs^ Island . syndi
cate j and chartered the '. steamship Lytton
to '. carry him and %his . friends to; Cocos.
The ', Lytton had a cargo for Salinas Cruz,
and there ; the party her. and was
carried to' the Island. ': â¢
The admiral and his friends landed, and
according: to the, officers of .the Lytton lo
cated" the' cave,*; but 'discovered | that land
slides had burled it -beyond 'their power
to disinter .with the appliances they had
provided. The Lytton carried the party, to
Panama, whence proceeded to Eng
land /to .prepare an . expedition properly
equipped to cope with conditions as , they
found them on Cocos Island. .The Lytton
returned .to Salinas '- Cruz, finished dis
charging her cargo and was on her; way
to Esqulmalt ' when' compelled /to seek
refuge ; here' on . account : of a r shortage of
'fuel., / " : - ;: *Â¦' "â¢ ;-. " "Â¦
: The British steamship Lytton, which ar.
rived here the other day from Salinas
Cruz and was put into quarantine on. ac
count of . sickness on board, brings from
the south the latest chapter in the ro
mantic story of the world-famous search
for the $30,000,000 treasure supposed to bo
buried In a cave on Cocos Island.
This treasure, so the oft-told tale goes,
represented the domestic treasure of Peru
at : the time that republic was fighting
Spain for its independence. The treasure,
mostly in gold coin, was placed for safe
custody aboard an | English sailing ship
commanded by one Thompson. A Peru
vian .'.. guard . was detailed to watch " the
treasure, but . Thompson and his crew
murdered the guard, sailed away from
Lima and landed at Cocos Island, where
they, buried the goldâ Â«ixty tons of It.
Thompson's ship was later 'captured by a
Peruvian man-of-war and all but Thomp
son were strung up . to the . yardarms.
Thompson escaped, made his way to New.
foundland, where he intrusted the secret
of the treasure's location with a certain
Keating, who In 1850 is alleged to have
visited Cocos and secured a small part of
.the treasure.

Platt ' therefore was forced, under the
circumstances, to file a f new. petition," In
which he . agreed- to abide by the provi
sions ot the charter regarding \ the 'grant
ing of franchises . for street railways.
These include the sale of the franchise
to .the ! highest bidder . and the payment
by, the â¢ company receiving the franchise
of 1! per cent of its gross -receipts for. -the
first ten years and 3 per cent thereafter.
The original application for,- the new
franchise was made* last December by
the company under the provisions of the
Broughton act. which at that time re
quired action to be taken on , a petition
filed by two-thirds of the property, own
ers along the route of the proposed fran
chise. The ; committee desired ' Mr. Platt
to withdraw the petition and {file a new
one in 'accordance with the terms of "the
charter. This Platt declined. to do. There
upon the repeal of the Broughton act was
secured at the last session of the Legis
lature. . . '-*/' '.'
The petition now reposes in the box
containing documents referred , to the
committee upon which action ( has been
postponed " for various reasons. Under its
own decision , in the matter the Public
Utilities Committee can. do nothing.' else
than consider the petition of the company
for a renewal of its franchise.'
" Now that the proposition of acquiring
the Geary street road for a "municipal
railway system has been beaten at the
polls the ouestion of an application of
the Geary Street Railway Company for
a new franchise along Its present route
will be at once considered byythe Board
of Supervisors.
The application for the franchise was
made by Horace G. Platt, president of
the railway company, last March. .'The
petition was for a twenty -five ,year fran
chise from. November 7, .1903, the present
franchise of the road expiring on Novem
ber 6. After considering the petition the
Public Utilities Committee, to : : which it
was referred,' postponed action' thereon
pending the result of the submission ; to
the neonle-of the proposition for the ac-|
quisltion by the city of the Geary-street
road. .Â¦ Â¦ - .
Policeman Cavanaugh stationed himself
at the Market-street entrance, Teutenberg
went to the rear entrance and Brady
climbed to the roof, joining Husted.
Brady called down the skylight, "Who
ever you are, you will have to surrender,
as you can't get away." A voice replied
from below, "All right, we'll surrender."
Brady and Husted procured a ladder
and made their way to the store. They
found two bovs. each 17 years of age,
and when asked what they were doing
there one of them replied that they want
ed to get enough money to take " them
out of town. They had removed the sky
light and got into the store by a ladder
which they found on the roof. They gave
their names as William Foley and Albert
Holtz. but It was later discovered that
Holtz's real name was W. H. Kerns.
They came from the East recently to find
employment as bellboys. They were book
ed for. burglary.
They' appeared before Police Judge Ca
baniss yesterday morning and were In
structed and arraigned. Holtz Insisted
upon making a statement. He said there
could be no denying tae fact that they
were found in the store, but as they had
taken nothing be thought , the Judge
might make the charge an attempt at
burglary or something light. The Judge
told him he could do nothing in the way
suggested and continued the case till this
morale*. *-
Special Officer Huster was discovered on
the roof of 768 Market street, which Is
occupied by Capp & Putnam as a corset
house, and he told the policemen that
he bad fired the shots and blown his
police whistle to attract their attention.
He had srone to the roof of the building
and found that the skylight had been
removed. He had also heard a noise as
if tone one was moving in the store.
Policemen and citizens who happened to
be in the neighborhood of Market
street and Grant avenue about 4
o'clock yesterday morning were startled
by hearinsr the reports of several shots
fired in quick succession and the blowing
of a police whistle. A rush was made ln^
the direction of the shots j and among'
those who were quickly on the scene were
Policemen Brady, Cavanaugh and Teut
enberg.
For the information of the * committee
B. Jobst stated Â¦ that he . now: has a fran
chise for thÂ« San Francisco ' and West
Shore Railway Company,: which 1 was
granted In 1892 by a former Board of Su
pervisors. Joost stated that . the ' repre
sentatives of the . ; Ban . Francisco and
Southern 'Railway Company -that were
applying for a. franchise . had used i the
data he had obtained at great expense
en ' the : representation : that - they desired
to purchase [ his . franchise.' .':- The commit
tee ascertained that' the ordinance grant-
Ing the franchise had not * ;been ' signed jbjr
Mayor Sanderson and ' consequently < Joost
had never been legally granted the priv
ilege.
The , petition of. the/ Merchants' Asso
ciation for permission to construct at the
Intersection Â¦ of Powell,; Market '; and ' Eddy
streets a : public "safety \ station "was 're
ferred to the Board of Public Works with
a request that the station be erected out
of the funds appropriated by : the; board
for the present fiscal year. .
Charles F. O'Callaghan, president of the
San Francisco and \ Southern Railway
Company, stated that he would give j the
names of the people Interested In obtain
ing the franchise to the committee in ex
ecutive session at once for its own in
formation, but must decline for business
reasons to give the names to' the* public.
Supervisor Braunhart opposed the prop
osition of , privacy . in the. matter of rail
road franchise^.-. He said It would be nec
essary to have the press - and ' the public
know who the Interested parties were
before the petition could be granted. The
committee decided that all deliberations
in the matter must be open, according fo
charter provisions.
. O'Callaghan said that. the company was
willing â¢ to pay all expenses incurred by
the Board of Public Works in, investigate
ing and reporting upon the application for
a franchise. O'Callaghan also agreed to di
vulge the names of the stockholders of
his company prior to the recommendation
made, to the board by -the committed re
garding the franchise. The committee
thereupon referred the . petition . to. the
Board- of Public Works with the under
standing that all expenses .incident to the
investigation by that board shall be paid
by the company, which will be required to
deposit a sufficient sum for. the purpose.
M. E: Cerf, attorney for the Western
Pacific Railway Company, which wants a
franchise along Sixteenth :; and:^ other
streets, said that he would' make known
the names of the stockholders In. the con
cern when ordinance granting the
franchise came | up j for final passage. He
promised to give Information at that time
which . would" warrant the ! Supervisors . in
voting* for the measure. The committee
was not altogether satisfied with this pro
posal and put the application over for one
week. Â¦' Â¦-.â¢. .-..'â¢". Â¦Â¦' -' Â¦â¢ Â¦'

tee yesterday Â¦ as to whether they were

NEW FRANCHISE
Fallon was always highly regarded foe
the place, but the objection to him was
based on the claim that he had had no
experience in handling criminals. "When
he showed that he had served as deputy
sheriff for nine years the objection was
overruled and he will probably be named
for the place at the coming meeting of
the Board of Prison Directors. <*.
TO GIVE NAMES
OF PROMOTERS
Â¦ The captain ; and mate were unable, to
render ' their shipmates any assistance,
havins their own hands more than full.
As they seized the yawl the little boat
flipped over, taking Mlkkelsen with her.
Mikkelsen's heels came down- with terr
rifle force, on the* face of Captain Gus
tavson, who had released his hold on the
yawl.. Such, holding on as "the captain
did for several minutes . after that was
purely a' matter of .instinct, for he was
completely stunned. .Time and again the
waves rolled .the little: boat and as she
wallowed bitterly cold seas swept against
the faces of the struggling men. !
'; For more than an hour they maintained
their ' hold on * their elusive refuge and
were both played out when the sloop
Governor of the Moraghan Oyster Com
pany, reached the scene of the wreck. "The
men wern . helped on board and later
brought to the city on the tug Elizabeth,
which E.: -W.-fCrellin. -president of the
Morgan Oyster Company," dispatched to
the rescue as soon as he heard of the
disaster. ! â¢ .
Larsen, the drowned engineer, was ~a
man of about 35 years of age and stood
high in the esteem of his. employers. His t
wife and three children left a few weeks
ago to- visit relatives in 'England. He
stepped on deck just a few minutes be
fore the scuall struck and was* standing
in the bow Vhen the Admiral went over.
He was a powerful swimmer, bnt in that
freight "encumbered sea his skill availed
him nothing. : i *, ~
McCondah was an Englishman, So years
of age; He p was hired by . Crellin on
Thursday night to. cook for the men em
ployed at the oyster be'ds. McGondah'ls
well known along the , water front, hav
ing served on a number of coasting
schooners and on : several of,' the; army
transports. He was a single man.
The Admiral sank where she capsized
and her, masts mark the location of her
'men found death In ? the . bay yes
terday during, 'the stiff .. southeaster which
swept the harbor and two others escaped
a similar fate onfy. after: more than an
hour's; heart breaking battle in the storm
tossed waters. The deaths and the strug
gle for. life* followed the ; capsizing ' off
Hunters Point, of the gasoline schooner
Admiral, belonging to the' Morgan Oys
ter Company. Those drowned were Emll
Larsen, " the'; Admiral's ' engineer, and
Charles Â» McCondah, 'i a cook, Â¦ who was on
his way to take a position .with the Mor-'
gan Company at- Mlllbrae. Captain Wil
liam XJuStavson and his mate, E. M.'Mik
.kelseh, J saved themselves I by clinging : to
an.jjverturned yawl until- picked up by
the gasoline, sloop Governor.-. ;
The^ Admiral,' a stanch craft' which - for
years has " made - almost , dally Â¦ trips be
tween Channel ": street : and the Morgan
Company's oyster : beds, ; started : shortly
after -0 o'clock- yesterday/ morning for
MiUb'rae. ,She had 1 - on 'deck -a ton of Ice
and- a pile of 'empty boxes.' 'After ; clear
ing the "wharves' eail was holstedi l and
until 0:45 all., went well. At that time,
when the schooner had reached a point
about a mile southeast of Hunters Point,
a | terHflc squall | struck her and before
Captain Gustavson ,' could make a move
over went ' the fAdmlral*.- All hands were
on deck and . everybody was j thrown Into
the water. The schooner sank, but on
the surface remained â¢ her; yawl and the
empty oyster boxes. . Gustavson and Mik
kelsen grabbed, the .yawl. Larsen 'and
McCondah became - mixed up with- the
freight and after a few. minutes of frantic
struggle both disappeared. Â¦ .:
