There Â« as yet no suspicion
of serum gathering, again in
the pleura, but the disorder
of his kidneys is disquietr

During the early part of
the night his Holiness was
somczvhat restless. The oc
casional brief periods of
sleep were disturbed by dif
ficulty in breathing. Dr.
Lapponi and tlic Pope's
valet, Centra, did their best
to .nourish the at
brief intervals. 'THe Pontiff
spoke little' and seemed
much depressed. Chloral
and caffeine zvere adminis

About sunrise the Pope fell

than he had had all night.

, Fortunately, all climatic conditions in
Rome for the" time being are favorable
to the sufferer. The air is dellciously'cool
and "there . is a complete absence of ' the
enervating; sirocco. ; which depresses and
kills. The -bright sunshine streams into
the Papal ? apartment.. ,The encouraging
conditions J are Â¦ further augmented i by the
constant use of 'artificial rnea~ns\jf exhala

Except^ for -the ; brief time he ; passed .' In

throughout the day," 1 shifting , his position
Tuesday night the Pope obtained but
little refreshing sleep, and with his
sleeplessness was augmented depression.
The difficulty in breathing had increased
and a derangement of the kidneys began
to seriously manifest itself. These com
plications ' were fully and frankly stated
by the doctors. Their official bulletin was
supplemented in the course of â¢ personal
conversation, in which they showed that
they entertained scarcely any^hope for
recovery. Yet they always qualified their
statements, setting forth the remarkable
constitutional strength and indomitable
energy of the patient as the most strik
ing evidence of his almost superhuman will.
They instanced the dying man's leaving
his bed during" the" morning and taking
several steps, unaided pave by a cane, to
an armchair.
* When this became known many were
disposed to criticize the doctors for per
mitting such an exhausting effort, but it
was explained that the entire absence of
fever*, the temperature being" even below
normal, eliminated .the danger of syn
cope from his exertion. Moreover, the at
tending physicians 'Â¦ recognized . that they
were battling with a man of Iron will,
who does not knowthe meaning of re
straint.
CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE,
NEW DANGER APPEARS.
Throughout yesterday the reports from
the sick room alternated with fear and
hope. At times rumors of the gravest
character gained currency.
Â«*y^ OME, July 9, 1:13 a. m.â The life
Mj of Pope Leo continues to hang by
f^^ a thread, with the expectation
â¢ that any moment may bring the
final catastrophe. Yet the won
derful vitality of the remarkable old man
is combating, a complication of diseases
which would endanger a stronger man in
the prime of life. The corner of the pal
ace which remained lighted the longest
during the night was the apartment of
Cardinal Rampolla, where the lights were
extinguished only a short time after
those In the room where Mgr. Volponl,
one of the Pontiff's most intimate friends,
is lying in a serious condition as a result
of the attack of syncope that he suffered
to-day. Pope Leo, as though he had sec
ond sight, has asked several times why
Mgr. Volponi has not been to see him.
Naturally, the condition of Mgr. Volponi
has been kept from the Pope.

SAN RAFAEL. July 8.â It was
asserted here to-day upon good
authority that the. autopsy
upon the remains of Colonel
Best would reveal nothing
definite, as all of ' the organs
were missing, and that the body has
been stuffed with sawdust. A dispatch
received to-night from New York verifies
this assertion. Coroner F. ' E. Sawyer,
who is also an undertaker in' San Rafael,
prepared the remains for' shipping East.
When ' confronted with â¢ the statements
that the body was filled with sawdust
and that the organs were Â¦ missing, he
passed the responsibility up to his dep
uty, William Ward.
Dr. Sawyer said this evening:
"I was not aware that the organs wera
missing. I did not do the work and did
not see it done. In fact. I was not in
San Rafael at the time the body was pre
pared. Mr. Ward did the work and I do
not know how he did It."
"Did he not tell you about preparing
the body for shipment?"
"Yes. but did not tell me about remov
ing any organs. I was out on the.Gul
lixon case that day and did not see- the
work done."
"You will say, then. Dr. Sawyer, that
you did not know that any organs were
missing?"
"I will simply state that Mr. Ward did
the work. Any way, If the organs were
there they would reveal nothing, for the
reason that in our business we inject
poisonous fluids to preserve the body and
an autopsy would show arsenic and other
poisons."
William Ward was reticent and non
committal. He would neither affirm nor
deny that he had removed the organs.
"At the proper time," he said, "I will
make a statement, but at the present
time I will not state whether I removed
any organs or not.". â¢â¢
Two or three days ago, however. Ward,
when Interrogated as to whether he aske<Â£
Dr. Jones to perform, an autopsy, said:
"Yes, when we had the body in our
place 1' telephoned' to Dr. Jones and told
'. On May 0 the ..woman known as Mrs. Woods
wrote to. my mother this letter from the Great
Northern'v Hotel; Chicago: % V y Â° ur loving letter

this it was. stated that Colonel Best had
succumbed, to cerebral apoplexy. Were
this'the fact, the brain would disclose it.
and -the skull had not been opened. That
this declaration in the certificate is ab
solutely unfounded and that cerebral ap
oplexy; was not the cause of death was
determined . by , the physicians. They
found the brain healthy. The surgeons
were, positive in their assertion that the
certificate's declaration was not based on
fact. â¢' v ; Â¦_
' The autopsy was performed by Dr.

of- Essex County, assisted by Dr. P. S.

Charles /"S. Best, sons' of Colonel Best,
were present.
. Afteruhe autopsy. Colonel Best's sons
.were Informed of what had been ascer
tained. They made little comment except
that they are. now certain that their sus
picions are ] strengthened.
' \ M." Best said before the autopsy
was performed: v
-'Although Woodi gave us to understand that

including M. Pokotiloff. recently Russian
financial representative at Peking; Gen
eral Desseno, the military agent In
China; the civil and military authorities
at Moukden, and the administrator of
Newchwang. The proceedings at the
conference are enveloped* in profound se
crecy. It is popularly supposed that the
Russian officials are considering war
questions. The commercial foreign offices
at Newchwang and Port Arthur beV-eve
that the possibility of war is increasing
steadily. The Russian policy is believed
to be to bold the present positions in
Manchuria, including Nowchwang. and" to
take no steps t* avert hostility with Ja
pan. If it U assured that Japan will fight
unaided. The war feeling among the
Japanese in China is intensifying.
The Russian civil administrators, with
the Governor General of Newchwang,
have commenced the erection of a Gov
ernment building designed to hold al!
Russian offices, including the telegraph
and telephone departments, in the center
of the foreign settlement, partly on land
ceded by the Chinese, according to the
Russian explanation, and partly on tHe
public square, about which the foreign
consulates are congregated. The resi

to protest against this encroachment on
the public sq-jare.

As soon as Pursell realized that he had
been shot, he called to his brother-in-law,
Joseph White, who was standing In front
of the wounded man's residence, to take
his team and climbed down from the
wagon. He walked to his house and
through the back yard to the, light com
pany's office, where he asked one of tho
employes to send for a doctor, stating
that he had been wounded. By this time
he was faint from pain and loss of blood
and it devolved on those present to assist
him to his home. Dr. William Lucas an
fiwered the summons and had the Injured
man put to bed at once.--
Transfer Line, which occurred
Tuesday evening at that place. Pursell
was driving his team home after finish
ir.g his day's work and as he turned intd
Tunnel avenue from Railroad avenue on
his way to the barn he was shot in the
left shoulder. Undoubtedly the would-be
assassin had aimed fcr the heart, but the
lurchir.gs of the wagon caused the in

intended.

The great majority . of the people of
Richmond believe that Colonel Thornton
Is responsible for the dastardly "attempt

conducted immediately after the. warrants
were secured by Sheriff" Veale, Deputy-
Sheriff Joe Moitoza; and Attorney W. D.
Grady, who has been' employed "as a. spe-
Sirrenberg's arrest was due mainly to
his unwillingness to Impart any Informa
tion to the officers regarding Thornton's
movements after the shooting. HÂ« pro
tested that he did not know how Thorn
ton came into the saloon, whether by the
rear or front door, and said he did not
notice him until the colonel ordered a
glass of beer. His inexplicable density
aroused the suspicion that he knew more
of the affair than he was willing to tell
and at the request of Pursell. who swore
to the complaint. Sirrenberg was ar
rested an an accomplice and taken to the
County Jail at Martinez yesterday after
noon. He bears an excellent reputation
In Richmond and It is generally believed
that his w.orst connection with the case
Is In trying to shield his friend Thornton.
SIRRENBERG IS SILENT.
Joseph Moitoza decided it would be un
eafe to keep his prisoner longer in Rich
mond, so he sent his brother Frank with
Thornton In a buggy to San Pabio. where
a train was caught and the prisoner safe
ly landed in the County Jail at Martinez.
Early yesterday morning Sheriff R. R.
Veale arrived In Richmond, accompanied
by Justice of the Peaen E. P. Mastt.rson
of San Pablo, and Immediately took per
sonal charge of the case. Judge Uaster-
Bon, after a conference with Frank Pur
fell, issued warrants for Thornton and
also for Henry SJrrenberg. proprietor of
the Louvre saloon, charging them joint
ly with assault i to murder. Sirrehpcrg's
saloon adjoins the office of Thornton and
the rear door of the Faloon can readily
be gained through Thornton's yard. The
two men have been close friends and
have been accustomed to take their meals
together in the saloon.* It 'was in this
saloon that Thornton was found after the
shooting. Â»
Notwithstanding Thornton's denials, he
was placed sunder arrest and the officiate
and citizens started an investigation Into
the crime. Thornton lived in a cottage
directly opposite the junction of Railroad
and Tunnel avenues. It was found that
a panel in the fence adjoining his house
had been sawed out at a distance of
about eighteen inches from the top. Run
ning from thfc fence at an acute angle
to a post in the yard and at a level with
the bottom of the hole made by the re
moval of the panel was a stick at about
the proper height to make a good gun
rest fcr a man of Thornton's stature.
Over the hole In the fence had been
placed a board, covered with canvas, in
such a way as to leave an ample port
hole, but hiding the sa wed-out panel
from the notice of passers-by.
When these Incriminating facts were
discovered and it was understood that
Pursell'B injuries were very *erious, the
residents of the town became much
wrought up. There was strong talk of
lynching and from among the large crowd
gathered around the Louvre saloon there
were frequent cries of "Get a rope!"
"Lynch him!"
Deputy Joe Moitoza asked him if he
had a rifle and he said that he did not and
never had owned one since he had lived
in Richmond.
DENIES OWNING RIFLE.
tincer, who is said to be over 70 years of
age. was arrested and charged with the
crime. He was found in the Louvr6
ealoon, only a few steps from the scene
of the attempted assassination, by Deputy
Sheriff Frank Moitcza. and on his person
was found a .38 caliber revolver, with all
the chambers full. Â¦ Deputy Sheriff Joseph
G. Moitoza arrived a few seconds after
ward and the two deputies questioned
Thornton regarding the shooting. He de
nied knowing anything about it, although
he exhibited extreme nervousness during
the examination.
"There Is my gun," he said, "you can
see that all the loads are in it.' 1 >Â¦
The injured man was. resting easily
last night. Drs. Lucas and Abbot are In
attendance on him. They pronounce his
wound sf rlous but not necessarily fatal
unless the shock should be greater than
expected. It Is Bald that Pureell Is dis
couraged and fears he may die, which
state of mind Is regarded as unfavorable
to his recovery. The doctors determined
yesterday afternoon not to attempt prob
ing for Â«rts' bullet, and It will be' allowed
to remain In.Pufseirs body unless Its pro
duction shall be demanded as absolutely
necessary in the prosecution of the case
against Thornton, In which case It will
have to be located by an X-ray. .
Some years ago Thornton, who at the
time was a contractor on the Valley road,
had a dispute with a laborer ovef wages
at Stockton, and shot the man. through
the hand,. for which offense he was fined
?500. ;. â¢ .. ;â¢'.' â¢ :
The trouble that led up to the attempt
ed assassination Is said to have had its
beginning on the night of June 6, when
Purseli and a tlval drayman named W.
M. Richards became engaged In a stree't
fight. - Colonel Thornton started to take
a liana against Pursell. when the latter'a
brother-in-law. Joseph White, knocked
him down and beat him severely. Pursell
and White were arrÂ«>sud f but wera ac
quitted bv a Jury.
Thornton is a Kentuckian by birth, a
notrd fire-eater, and Is said to .have
brooded deeply over the thrashing, blam
ing Pursell for Its administration. He is
a man of considerable means and- has
done a thriving business as an architect,
designing nearly all the new buildings in
Richmond. It Is expected that lift will
make, a vigorous effort to 'clear himself
of the charge, and it Is said that In ad
dition-to his own means he will be as
sisted by friends in making his- fight for
freedom/ Both he and Sirrenberg -were
held without bail to await the outcome
of Pursdl's wound. . '
"There are Some", however, who' protest
a belief of Thornton's Innocence and that
he is .-not- without irlcnds .s evidenced In
many ways. Besides Slrrenberg, vWho is
maintaining, silence, supposedly 'through
friendship., some zealous Thornton sup
porters daubed the freshly pawed panel
with dirt Tuesday night to give it the
appearance of an old cut. Unfortunately
for the success of this idea, many. people
had already viewed the marks and found
them recent, and In addition the dauber
neglected to treat .â the marks of the
hatchet on" the inside of the fence, which
still give testimony to their freshness.
THORNTON HAS FRIENDS.
A search of Thornton's office And effects
disclosed the presence in a toolchest of a
keyhole saw and a hatchet, with nicks in
the blade. An examination 'at the sawed
off panel showed that the piece had been
knocked out with a hatchPi and the'
marks on the wood corresponded to the
nlCKs ki the blade of the hatchet.' The
lid to the -toolchest had been screwed
down after the tools had been replaced.
In a locked trunk was found a 22-calibcr
repeating rifle, carrying a long cartridge,
and in the barrel was aÂ« discharged shell.
The: rifle hod been "broken" and stock
and barrel shoved in the trunk hurriedly.
The hole made in the Clothing of Pursell
fitted exactly a 22-calib^r bullet, and all
these things taken In connection left no
doubt In the minds of the officials and
citizens arenerally that the bullet which
wounded Pursell -was sped from the rifle
found In the trunk and that it was
Thornton's finger that pressed the trig

Dr. Antonio Cardarelli and Dr. Guido
Baccelli.
But, apart from the question of hurt
ing Dr. Lapponi's feelings, further diffi
culty thereupon arose, owing to the ex
isting relations between Church and
State. Dr. Cardarelli was a member of
the Chamber of Deputies for sixteen years
and is now a Senator: that is to say, he
nils a position which has necessitated not
only taking the oath of allegiance to the
King and to support the constitution, but
he also has sworn to obey -the Italian
laws. Including the Papal guarantees,
which regulate the position of the Papacy
in regard to the Italian State, thus mak
ing him obnoxious to the Papal partv. ',
Dr. Baccelli's position is even more dif
ficult. In addition to havinsr been a
member of the Chamber of Deputies for
thirty years he Is actually a Minister of
the crown of Italy, being Minister of
Commerce, Industry and Agriculture. Dr.
Baccelli occupies such a high position in
medical science that, notwithstanding his
political principles, he has often, been
called to the . deathbed of prominent ec
clesiastics and was consulted during the
last illness of Pope Pius IX.. but then he
was not a * Minister and had not been
one. .-â¢
In spite of these objections, the wishes
of the Pocd family were respected and
It was announced that Drs. Lapponi and
Mazzoni would consult with Dr. Carda
relli to-morrow morning.
To-night the Vatican rejected the idea
of a consultation with Dr. Baccelli. be

who wish to defend themselves, from the
attacks on their diagnosis of " the case,
but it Is Interesting as the firs* docu

point of view.. The account runs as fol

"On the morning of Tuesday, June 30,
Pope Leo went for a drive in the Vatican
gardens. On; returning . he declared that
he had been greatly . benented by the
Lapponi and Mazzoni had misjudged the
disease, taking for pneumonia what was
really pleurisy. Both â¢ accepted the . Idea
of a consultation with anyÂ»of their col
leagues. Many eminent"' specialists have
been proposed, but it was stated to-night
that It practically had been determined
that Dr. Rossini should be called in if an
other consultation"- was decided upon.
However, Dr. Mazzoni said that' in his
opinion there was no immediate need of
a consultation and that one would not be
held unless the present conditions
changed.
. Groups of silent, curious persons
watched the lights glimmer In the sick
chamber till past midnight from the
broad- piazza outside St. Peter's, anxious
ly waiting for news from within. Now
and then distinguished prelates came and
inquired regarding the Pope's condition,
and > they in turn would give to the little
groups their varying impressions of hopÂ«
and fear. The prevailing sentiment of
those admitted nearest to the sufferer is
that his life Is gradually ebbing away,
but whether the final agency will be a
matter of hours "or, of ; days neither the
doctors nor his nearest friends can tell.
France Will Not
Claim Right to

dinal Mathleu would in the event
of the death of the Pope claim for France
the ancient right to exercise high patron

An inquiry on the subject at the Foreign
Office brought the reply that the report
was untrue. No such instructions have
been sent to Cardinal Mathleu or to.oth
er. Cardinals. ' The presence of Cardinal

Supreme Pontiff As He appeared in the Prime of Life and Before His Present Illness
Pontiff Sorry
That He Cannot
Continue Work
*f\ OME, July 8.â The following partic
[J ulars of the visit of Dr. Lapponi and
i^Dr. Mazzoni to the Pope this morn
ins were obtained:
"How feels his Holiness this morning?"
esked Dr. Mazzoni. t,
S"I arn weaker."
â¢â¢Perhaps you did not sleep sufficiently."
l# No, no," answered the Pope. "I was
..jtter last nighty I am sorry, because
to-day should be a day of grsat-work."
â¢â¢Surely," Dr. Mazzoni replied, "his Ho
liness does not intend to work?"
"Certainly." answered the Pope. "I
have so many things to do, but I am
afraid I have not the strength."
Both of the doctors then proceeded to
convince, the Pontiff of the necessity of
rest, urging him rot to place obstacles in
the way of his recovery.
"I shall do as you wish." said the Pope
in conclusion, with a sigh of resignation.
Afterward his Holiness expressed a de
sire to rise, saying he would be more
comfortable in his arm chair. The Pope's
attendant, Rio Clntra, proceeded to help
him to arise, but the Pope refused his as
sistance, saying he could still move by
himself. In fact, without any help ex
cept that afforded by his cane, the Pon
â¢tlff walked a lew steps to his arm chair,
repeating now and then, "I am weaker,
1 am weaker."
Part of the work referred to by the
Pope was to repeat a notfena to the Ma
donna of the Cermeni, whose feast begins
to-day. The- Pope is a very devout ven
erator of this madonna.
Dr. Mazzoni, speaking about the Pope
this afternoon, remarked: \
"It has always been said that Pope Leo
has shown powers of extraordinary resis
tance to disease. He enjoys the absolute
harmony of all his organs and of his
physical, moral and intellectual qualities.

The evening official bulletin, following
a consultation Â¦ between : Drs. . Lapponi ' and
Mazzoni,* completely contradicted Â¦'â¢ the
alarmist reports and gave the most fa
vorable statement. This was disclosed in
the improved pulse, better respiration
and ameliorated general condition. Dr.
Mazzoni said in a. conversation following
the issuance of the 8:13 o'clock bulletin
that while the Pope's condition continued
desperate recovery was not entirely Im
possible. H9EBtl
CONSULTATION TO BE HELD.
Unfortunately some elements in the
population of Rome, including a few who
are high in the councils of the Vatican,
are inclined to cast doubt on the sincerity
of the bulletins. This led during the day
to a strong movement in favor, of calling
other physicians... Thei, theory of the ini-j

<yvOME, July 8.â The churches this
. f^ morning .were more crowded than
is usual with supplicants interced

peating the pro pontlfico infirmo prayer.
An instance of the strain prevailing ow
ing to the Pope's illness is the case of a
Roman who went to the Basilica and
shouted: //7'~"
"I am the Pope's nephew. The Pope Is
dead. We are all lost; we must all die."
He tried to throw himself from a con
siderable height, but was rescued and
taken into custody.

prayers for his recovery will be an

Crowd Churches
to Offer Prayer
for Pope's Life
#Â«X O1IE, May 8.â The election of a new
JJr Pope generally brings a change in
the great departments, including
the Papal Secretary of State and Vicar of
Rome, the representative of the Pontiff
in spiritual affairs; the Vice Chancellor,
who has charge of issuing the Papal
bulls; the Grand Penitentiary, who pre
sides at the tribunal of penitentiaries,
granting absolution under certain circum
stances, and the Librarian of the Holy
Church, besides all other positions more
or less important associated with or de
pending on these gTeat dignitaries.
There is only one man who holds such a
position as to be certain to profit by the
election of a new Pope, If the usual cus
tom is observed. This is the Secretary
of the Consistorlal Congregation, who,
during the conclave, acts as Secretary of
State. It is his duty, when a Pope is
elected, to advance, kneel and offer the
Pope's Protest
Against Politics
in the Church
W^ OHE, July 9.â A tragic Impression
. JfS is made by the Pope's appearance
Sf^Â£' on all who are allowed to ap-
Â¦* proach him. His head, leaning
back on the cushion of his arm
chair, seems inanimate, and one wonders
â¢whether one is before a. shadow or a
husan form. The unconsciousness in
which he is lost from time to time causes
him to look like a corpse. It might be be
lieved that he is dead were it not for the
Â¦heavy and irregular breathing, which
shows that he is alive.
His Holiness passed sleepless hours on
Tuesday nig-nt, which arrested the im
provement that had manifested Itself
Tuesday evening, and this greatly en
feebled the illustrious sufferer. . The end
â¢was believed to be quite near yesterday
morning, and rumors of the Pope's death
â¢were circulated in the city. Several times
before noon the newspapers had issued
special editions stating- that the sovereign
* Pontiff was in the last death throes. The
Cardinals thereupon returned to the Vati
can in gTcat haste and the populace
f ocked to the various churches to pray
lor the repose of the Pope's soul.
However, his Holiness was maintaining
I his supreme Ftrugsle against death and
lr.sisted on risinp and dressing, still re
furiryr the assistance of his valet.
Throughout the morning- he remained
Fcat.d in his armchair in a semi-ccn
c!?!oi:f state.
'Â¦'- TAKES SOME NOUSISHMENT.
In the afternoon his pcneral depression
was Irs? acute, end the administration of
nourishment, which had been almost im
pof=sible in the morning, became compar
* ativc-ly easy, this conducing to improve
ment in the patient** peneral condition.
In the course of the afternoon his Holi
ness wished to resume the tasks to which
he has devoted his attention during his
illness. Ho asked for the latest dispatches
from sovempns who were making (n
" quiries about his condition. When Count
Pecci. his nephtw. expressed a desire
that he should be visited by other physi
cians, he replied:
"No. no; I do not wish to see doctors
â¢who are strangers to me. If Professor
Mazroni and- Dr. Lapponi cannot succeed
.in curing me it means that divine Provi
dence is summoning me."
SAYS THE END IS NEAR.
Durir.g Professor Mazzoni's visit in the
evening he said:
"I am so weak I cannot last much long
* er, and I must lea-^ undone many things
which I desired to arrange before my de
parture for eternity." : V .
Sensational rumors were again circu
lated at night, but I am in a position to
state that the Pope's condition remains
absolutely stationary-. His Holiness is
calm, but Count Sat jecii, who left the
Vatican at midnight, says that Leo up
to then had not been able to sleep.
In. anticipation of crowds in the city
during the conclave the hotels, which
c!0sed at the end of the season, are re
opening. It is expected that 40,000 strang
ers will flock to Rome. . _
which Is the real cause of his great re
sistance to illness. Notwithstanding his
advanced age and his present sickness,
the Pope has a constitution capable of
enabling him to recover. The difficulties
and delicacy of the moment are created
by the personality of the Pope. He is a
very sensitive man and a person to whom
a simple injection of caffeine causes
great suffering for about three hours.
Three years ago, when I operated on him
for a cyst, it was said he did not suffer,
but in reality he did suffer intensely.
"The liquid taken yesterday from the
pleura may gather again and another
operation may be necessary, but I hope
not. Some of the- liquid may remain and
often the little which is left is sponta
neously absorbed, which may be the case
with the Pontiff."

Xew York Herald Publishing Company.
On Thursday he declared he felt well,
but Dr. Lapj>onl. wishing to know person
airy the nature of the disturbance com
plained of, spent the night at the Vati
can. During the night the Pope was
sleepless and restless.
"On Friday Dr. Lapponi examined the
Pope and found pulmonary inflammation
in the right thorax, between the^ Inferior
and middle lobes. He informed Cardinal
Rampolla and began the treatment
which he thought right on Saturday. Dur
ing the day the inflammation spread. Dr.
Lapponi, ' worried, desired to have Pope
Leo seen by Dr. Mazzoni. who, since the
operation of 1S20. has visited the Pontiff
occasionally, replacing Dr. Lapponi dur
ing his illness with appendicitis.
"On Sunday Dr. Mazzoni went to the
Vatican and examined the patient with
Dr. Lapponi, confirming the tatter's
diagnosis, viz: An inflammatory process
in the lung, which was denned In the
medical bulletin as , pulmonary heptlza
tion. The original treatment was con
tinued, consisting of supporting the
strength of the heart and general condi
tion of the patient.,
"No noticeable change was observed*
until Monday evening. It was then founu
that tbe lowest part of the right thorax,_
which previously was pervious to respira
tion, had become Impervious, affecting
the function of the lung. The presence of
liquid was suspected. The Pontiff spent
an agitated and sleepless night.
"On Tuesday many symptoms con
firmed the presence of liquid. Its In
crease was considered to account for the
Pope's general condition growing worse.
After a test puncture SCO grammes of
blood and liquid were extracted. The
condition of the patient Improved Imme
diately, reviving' hope, slight In some
persons and exaggerated In others. The
amelioration in the condition of the pa
tient was not continued during Tuesday.
Indeed, depression gained the upper
hand."
fresh air and wished to repeat the- drive.
The Pooe Â«aid he felt no need of a medi
cal visit and informed Dr. Lapponi not
to go and see him.
"During the night of "Wednesday, July*-
I, Pope Leo complained ot Intestinal
disturbance, which he attributed to con
stipation. Notwithstanding he went Into
the Vatican gardens and returned to his
apartments, again' feeling' benefited from,
his drive.
It became known later that. the motive
for Dr. Mazzoni's sudden call by Cardinal
Rampolla originated in what Vatican cir
cles have already baptized the "rebellion
of the Cardinals" against Dr. Lapponi.
It appears that some of. the Cardinals
complained of the doctor's treatment of
the patient, thinking that Dr. Lapponi
had not. from the â¢ beginning, detected
that the Pope was suffering from an affec
tion ofithe pleura, thus allowing the dis
ease to assume a gravity which otherwise
perhaps might have been avoided.
Dr. Lapponi, who is supported by Dr.
Mazzoni, indignantly repudiated the idea.
Both of the doctors declared that barely
five days had elapsed since the Pope be
came ill and they claimed that three days
ago they detected water in the pleura
and added that it was not possible, when
the liquid was just gathering, nor was it
prudent, considering the age and weak
ness of the Pontiff, to risk a test puncture
before having almost certainly detected
the presence of serum.
NOTED PHYSICIANS BARBED.
However, the criticising Cardinals not
only maintained their view, but succeed
ed in reaching the. ear of Cardinal Ram
polla. Besides this, the Pope's relatives
proposed that a consultation be held with
the most illustrious physicians, naming
whispered conversation ensued.
This gave rise to all kinds of
rumors, but It was soon explained that
Cardinal Rampolla had taken upon him
self the duty of acting as mouthpiece for
some of the intimate friends and rela
tives of the Pope, who suggested- the ad
visability of calling certain other doctors
into consultation. Dr. Mazzoni replied
that he had not the least objection to
such a consultation, but that the symp
toms and course - of the disease were so
clear and well-defined as to leave no
doubt as to the diagnosis. He, therefore,
was unable to see the necessity i for the
step proposed.

Captain Cullundan will be called. So

grain . remaining in the warehouses is
shown with its distinctive marks, fixing
Its location. The . bare spaces of the
warehouses appear where large quantities

experts who have examined the books of
Eppinger & Co. will testify.
Friday is likely to be the critical day
in the Grand Jury proceedings. Then It
will probably be determined whether in
dictments shall be found against Jacob
Eppinger. Herman Eppinger and Bern
hard Ettlinger.
After taking the testimony outlined In
the foregoing, the grand jurors spent
some time in going over the testimony
that has been received and discussing it.
An adjournment was taken to to-mor
row afternoon at 2 o'clock. Then the
last of the testimony will be heard.
DISCUSS TESTIMONY.
The testimony of C. F. Herlitz related
to a cart of this wheat. Cutter & Mose
ley delivered it ' i E. C. Evans to the
amount of 400 tons to be shipped on the
Pierre I>otl, and C. F. Herlitz superin
tended the shipment. Robert Herlitz had
the same sort of information for the
Grand Jury. He is connected with Costi
gan & Co.. Costican . sold to Evans 200
tons of wheat that was shipped on the
Bayard. '
H. McFaull. the weigher at Crockett,
testified that he saw Eamund Freund re
marking wheat In the Crockett ware
houses twn days before the failure of
Eppinger & Co. This . contradicted the
testimony previously given by Freund.
Edmund Freund went over about the
same ground as at his previous appear
ance before the Jury. His memory ap
peared to be better than before.
Including what was testified to last
evening witnesses have told of ten lots
of wheat that were shipped from the
Crockett warehouses while the creditors
supposed the grain was etill at Crockett
as security for their loans of gold.
The testimony of . Captain Cullundan
went over until the next meeting of the
Grand Jury. He has important knowl
edge concerning the smuggling of the
grain warehouse grain books from Crock
ett.
P. G. Eastrich of the International
Bank testified concerning the loan made
by his hank April 11 last. The money
was loaned 'on the security of warehouse
receipts fnr wHteat. Some of this wheat
was shipped away April 1 and some in
March, part on the Pierre Lot! and part
on the Bayard, all before the loan was
made. Mr. Eastrich vyas not questioned
long. ; .,
Peter Deming was not inclined to give
the jury much help in finding out abo.ut
the book episode, and it was while he
w'as being questioned about the missing
books that he was warned concerning
his answers. The jurors received from
Deming gome statements that were con
tradictory. He admitted that he received
at Crockett two packages^ from his son
at the warehouses, but claimed that he
did not know what they contained. He
sent them to his house in San Fran
cisco. What was held back by Deming
was given to the jurors by other wit
nesses. Before the night was over it was
testified that Peter Deming was on the
barge San Joaquin when the missing
books were put there by his son James;
that the books were brought to this city
and then were taken by Deming to the
restaurant at 14 Sacramento street, which
is kept by John Windt; that from Windt's
place they were carried by Expressman
Fred Berg to Peter Deming's home; that;
a search was made for the books by
Morse's detectives In Deming's back yard;
that women In the house told the detec
tives that the books had been taken
away two days earlier and that they were
moved away by Fred Berg; that John
Windt offered to sell to the detectives
information about the books; that there
was no question as to the manner in
which the books left Crockett, as one
box was open, and that Bragg, who
shipped the books, billed them as house
hold goods. Berg and Windt told what
they knew about the books, all of which
is included in the preceding.
There was a discrepancy in the testi
mony as ' to what happened at Peter
Deming's house when the books from the
Crockett warehouse were taken there by
Expressman Bere. It was testified that
Berg went directly In with the packages,
but other testimony proved that the doors
of the house are always kept locked and
that some woman came down to let Berg
in with the books.
The books in auestion are those that
tell all about the movements of grain into
and out of warehouse. They are now in
possession of Attorney Ach.
BANKER TESTIFIES.
RECEIVED PACKAGES.
Eppinger & Co.'s failure engaged the
attention of the Grand Jury last night
and much testimony was taken. The
witnesses summoned wer# Edmund
Freund, bookkeeper at the Crockett ware
houses; Hugh McFaull," weigher at the
same warehouses; C. F. Herlitz. grain
sampler for Cutter & Moseley; Robert
Herlitz. grain sampler for Costigan &
Co.; John Wlndt .restaurant-keeper at 14
Sacramento street; Fred Berg, an ex
pressman; Peter Deming, father of Su
perintendent Deming of the Crockett
warehouses; Captain Callundan of
Morse's detective agency and P. G. East
rich of the International Bank. Not all
were heard, but enough of Interest came
out to keep the Jury and District Attor
ney Bylngton busy until late.
Peter Deming was the first witness. He
was before the Grand Jury one hour. He
had a somewhat exciting time. Once he
was told that if he was not more careful
with his answers he would be in danger
of going to jail. His reluctant testimony
was mainly about the spiriting away
from Crockett of the warehouse grain
books, for which the creditors subse
quently caused a search to be made at
the house of Peter Deming. at 2756 Taylor
street, this city.
Indictments May Be Brought in To-
Morrow, When Final Evidence
Will Be Presented for
Consideration.
Missing Grain Books Form
Basis of Varied
Testimony.
We have heard for some time that certain
persons were threatening to institute proceed
ings to set aside, or declare invalid, the sales
of the constituent properties to the United
Railroads. This, as I have said, however,
caused us no uneasiness, for all of these mat
ters had. at the time of their consummation,
the careful attention of the best legal talent
obtainable, including such lawyers as Judge
Oarber, Mr. Foulds and Mr. Heller of San
Francisco, and Mr. Atterbury of New York.
Every possible phase of the questions sug
gested by the attorney first referred to were
exhaustively examined, together with every
possible phase of every other possible ques
tion it was conceived could in any manner
arise in connection with the sales and trans
fers of the several constituent properties to
the United Railroads. The attorneys engaged
in the matter were unanimous in their con
clusions and all agreed that the sales and
transfers were in every way valid and lawiul.
Just why these proceedings should now be
threatened I. of course, do not know. I do
know, however, that they are giving the
United Ralhoads no concern. The fact is that
the whole matter is a tempest in a teapot, for
practically all of the stockholders of the sev
eral selling companies joined In the sales and
transfers and the few remaining shares out
standing are In every way fully protected.
TIrey L. Ford, chief counsel for the
United Railroads, reiterated his state
ments published in yesterday's Call to
the effect that the reports of the suit
neither surprised nor annoyed the com
pany. He said:
Granting for the sake of argument that the
agents of those who purchased the road for the
present owners did, as has been charged, se
cure a majority of the stock of the different
old companies and then vote to sell the roads
to. the Kant'-rn corporation, what would be
gained by proving this to be a fact, in court?
Eyen if the United Railroads relinquished its
control to the local lines, the stock of 'the
latter would still be owned by the stockhold
ers of the company now managing them and
they would continue to direct the destinies of
the different old companies. It would in no
way benefit those who are now threatening to
disrupt the new corporation. The latter owns
95 per cent of the stock of most all the com
panies that were absorbed by the United Rail
roads and 92 per cent of all. feo that I do not
lee where these dissatisfied stockholders expect
to cut much of a figure In any legal contro
versy.
At the offices of the United Railroads
the officials stated that they were not
worrying about any suit, for they had
heard, of the contemplated move some
days ago and were not surprised that II
had finally become a matter of public
knowledge. One of the officials of tha
road, who did not care to have his name
mentioned in connection with the matter,
said the suit had been a subject of gos
sip in New York for a number of weeks
and that the representatives of the cor
poration there had regarded it as v>
scheme to harass the management and
possibly force a compromise. He con
tinued:
The announcement published yesterday
that a suit was threatened against the
United Railroads with a view toward
having the Superior Court set aside the
recent sale of the local street railways to
that corporation on the ground that the
transfer was contrary to the provisions
of the law caused considerable talk in
financial circles and provoked much spec
ulation as to the probable outcome of
the proceedings. Among a certain coterie
of brokers, who, it is reported, had been
lately interested in a deal In the bonds of
the United Railroads, the news of the
suit is said to have caused a great deal of
uneasiness and they busied themselves for
several hours during the day trying to
learn who was actually behind the ac
tion.
I am almost beside myself with anxiety and
harily know what to do, but I am patiently
a waiting the solution of the mystery.
Possibly he may have been shanghaied and
put on t<ome sailing vessel, as I understand
there is a great demand for sailors now on
prsin ships going to Englsnd.
Perhaps, in the out-of-the-way railroad shops
at Albina, ncroe one killed him for the money
and thrn threw his body into the river. If
tlie police had taken any interest in the mat
ter something might have been found out. I
was a stranger in a strange land wid they took
very liitle interest in me. Frank has always
borne a fine reputation for honor and integ
rity, and 1 am certain he has met with foul
play.
He comes o f an excellent family. His father
is J. I*. Manning of the John Davis real estate
firm in Seattle, his partner being Frederick
Struve. formerly a banker in that city.
When his rather heard of his disappearance
he was almost overcome and is now endeavor
ing in every way to solve the mystery.
He left his watch and chain at home with
me and a'so his new gold locket and fob, to
gether with all his clothes, and I iave brought
thorn ail down here.
HAY BE SHANGHAIED.
He said he would come home at noon to take
my mother down to the train for Seattle,
v.hlch left nt 3 o'clock, but as he did not come
Fhe went away by herself. As night came on
1 became very much alarmed, and on Sunday
morning I went to the police and stated the
rase, but they did not seem to take much in
terest in the matter and told me that the>
guessed he had deserted me.
When he left me Saturday morning he had
â¢ bout $1R5 in frold with him and I am now
o* the opinion that he has been held up some
where and robbed of ills money.
Friday night my mother came up to Port
i- r.d on hi r way to Seattle to join my father,
who is at present in Seattle, and we all had a
I<!easant evening together and everything was
as friendly fig possible.
Saturday morning about 8 o'clock Frank went
to business, saying he was going to the work-
M:ops et Albina, which is just across the river
frcm Portland. That was the last we saw of
htm.
We went to the theaters and had a fine
time, and many of Frank's former friends

members of the Multnomah Amateur Athletic
Â«"lub and they Invited him to go to a big

but lie would net go because he did not want
to leave me alone.
We wcr.t to a private boarding-house at 193
Seventh street. We wÂ»re perfectly happy and
Krank said he had a good position with the
Southern Pacinc Rallrcad there.
FRIENDS IN ATHLETIC CLTJB.
Immediately after the ceremony we returned
to my home and told my mother, who. while
t-be did not object in Â»ny way to Frank, did
not want us to marry because the thought we
were too young to know our own minds. How
ever, a* long as we were married. she forgave
us. and that same night we started for Port
land, where v/e arrived Sunday morning.
The youthful bride, -who is only 17 years
of age, is at an utter loss to account for
her husband's disappearance.' In relating
the circumstances she said:
Fiank nnd I u^re very much In love with
each other and on Friday. Jnne 26. we de

concerning the hold-up of the Bartlett
Springs stage on the summit of Brim
Mountain on Monday show that there
were eight passengers who were made to
line up on the road by the cool highway
man and give over their valuables. Of
these Mrs. M. J. Hellman of Upper Lake
alone escaped paying toll to the road
agent through his gallantry In allowing
her to retain the money which was neces
sary to carry her to her destination.
Those who were less fortunate were L.
Charmock of Sacramento, C. N. Splero
of the Illinois Glass Works, San Francis
co; P. Pendergast and Mrs. Pendergast
of Sacramento, Cyrus Case and Mrs.
Case of Ceres. Mrs. Hellman and her
child completed the number of passengers

"Was he there on or about April 1, l'JOJ?"
"Yes; he came there prior to that date and
never left the house again alive. He was taken
sick then about April 1. but in two days
seemed a little better and wanted to get out
of bed, but Miss Woods would not let him
do bo. Soon after he made the assertion that
he was better and wished to get up. He sud
denly became worse and soon after that died."
"When did you first notice him sick?"
"At the supper table on, I think, April 2.
He seemed quite dizzy and complained of his
stomach. He looked very pale. 1 was waiting
at the table at the time and heard his con
versation and complaint. They sent him to
bed. I saw him In bed that night. He was
moaning and groaning and said he was very
sick at bis stomach."
"When did you asaln see him?"
"I saw him Thursday , night. He seemed to
feel better and coaxed to be allowed to get '
up. Mrs. Woods would not let him, though." Â¦
"When I saw him again I went to his ruom. I
Dr. Woods was there. I saw him stick a
needle or syringe into Colonel Best's arm and
pump something into It. The colonel became
unconscious very soon. He closed his eyes
in a heavy sleep and groaned. He never re
gained consciousness after that to my knowl
edge. I ulept In the next room to Colonel Best
and could hear him groan all night."
"WhÂ«?re were you when the needle was
stuck In Colonel Best's arm?"
"I was first on the left side of the bed, but
as socn as Dr. Woods came in I went on the
'right side of the room. He did not see me
looking and did it awful quick."
"On Arril 1 did Colonel Best seem to you
to be well?"
"Yes, sir. He seemed very healthy."
"Who occupied the house at the time Colo
nel Best was there?" . ,
"Woods, Miss Woods, Colonel Best, the Jap ;
and myself."
"During the illness of Colonel Best was

his Illness. I leave this p. m. Tours In sorrow,
"MRS. A. C. WOODS.
"N. B. â I thank you for P. O. order."
You may Imagine how surprised we were to
receive another from Woods himself about thre..
weeks later, the envelope showing' that It was
poetcd at Atlantic City, N. J. This showed he
was not dead, and this la the explanation he
gave.
"There peems to be a misapprehension . It
was a brother who died and not me. I am not
surprised, however, to learn of this mistake,
as I have been very seriously ill and am not
well yet."
He added he would try to pee us as soon as
possible and asked that all letters should be
forwarded to"Atlantic City, whence they would
be Â«ent to him should he decide to go into the
interior of the State.
Woods had reported In California that the
woman he called sister had inherited a fortune
from her fatner, who was dead. We found the
father in PhlllipsburK. Pa., living in a house
beside a railroad and In very poor circum
stances. He told us that Woods and his wife
had been there that very morning, but had
gone away.
One thing that made us suspicious about
father's death was the alleged expense incident
to his Illness and the funeral bill from the
undertaker for $450. of which $150 was for em
balming, was pretty high.
There were other Incidental expenses, one bill
from a nurse- for $20 for attending my father.'
They sent us the receipt for this signed "Annie
E. Shope," and we have been informed there was
no such person. Here is the receipt, and I call
your attention to the similarity of the writing
to that in the letters from Woods. No two per
sons ever wrote a capital "H" in that fashion,
and the other letter* are surprisingly similar.
When my brother William got to San Rafael
he found that they had already ! packed my
father's trunks, yet when they arrived here we
found many of his belongings missing. We
found them in Woods" trunks after we got a
search warrant in Atlantic City. We received
a dtEpatch from District' Attorney Boyd of Ma
rln County, California, this morning asking for
the exact value of the articles and saying that
unless they were worth more than $.'>0 Woods
could not be accused of a felony. Their value
was much more than that, and there is no
doubt in our minds that the note for $1000
which was made out to Woods and to which
what purports to be my father's signature Is
attached is a forgery. *
Nothing has been learned of the where
abouts of Woods.
there any trained nurse there?"
"Xot to my knowledge, and if there had
been I would have known it."
"When the colonel was sick what did the
Woods tell youn was the mater with him?"
"Mrs. Woods only told me he wag very ill.
Later, though, she told me he had apoplexy."
"When Colonel Best was unconscious, did
any one else see him?"
'"Yes, sir. Miss Hlckmott was there once
and saw him."
'"Did you ever see Dr. W. F. Jcnes there
during the illness?"'
"Yes. sir, but only once."
"When did Colonel Best die?"
"He died at 3 a. m., April 6. I did not
know it until about 6 o'clock In the morning.
Mrs. Woods came to my room, wr.ke me up
and told me the colonel was dead â that he
died at 3 a. m."
Jones also' made a statement today.
The District Attorney will not reveal the
contents of it, but asserts that In It are
some moat startling disclosures. It has
been learned, however, that Dr. Jones
states in his report that the case was a
peculiar one," while the treatment a'd
ministered was unusual. That he closely
interrogated Dr. Woods about the pa
tient's condition and that Woods admit
ted hi had given him morphine. Dr.
Jones signed the article on death, stating
the cause of demise to bt apoplexy.

them with grand larceny. The complaints

commuted grand larceny, to wit: Misap
propriated to their own use one type
writer, valued at 550; one satchel, valued
at $33, and one dressing wrapper, valued
at tl2.
The taking of about J600 In coin Is not
mentioned in the warrants, but Detec
tive de Pue says that he has sufficient
proof to show that the money was also
taken by the Woods.
In an old woodshed in the rear of the
Woods' house were found some vials
which analysis showed to contain various
deadly poisons. A hypodermic syringe
was also discovered near by.
From Miss Minnie Maghetti, an orphan,
domiciled at the Presbyterian Orphanage
near San Anselmo. a statement has been
obtained, which, in the light of late de
velopments, may prove of considerable
Importance.
MisÂ« Maghetti was employed by the
Woods for elx months and was at their

one occasion, she claims, she saw Woods
insert a hypodermic syringe into Colonel
Best's left arm and injecte a fluid. After

. LONDON, July 8.â Although President
Loubet did not retire until long after mid
night he arose at the customary hour,
6:30 a. m., and started on another long
day's functions at about 9 o'clock, when,
accompanied by Foreign Minister Del
casse, Embassador Cambon and his suite,
the President proceeded to visit Windsor
Castle. He traveled In the King's train
and was met at the railroad station by.
the Mayor and corporation of Windsor,
who welcomed him to the royal borough.
The President drove to the castle, escort
ed by Horse Guards, and inspected both
the state and private apartments and
visited the mausoleum at Frogmore,
where M. Loubet deposited a wreath on
Queen "Victoria's tomb. The Presidential
party subsequently returned to London.
King Edward, Queen Alexandra, Presi
dent Loubet, the Prince and Princess of
Wales, the Duke arid DucheBS of Con
naught, Foreign Minister Delcasse, Em
bassador Cambon and others proceeded
to Aldershot this afternoon for the pur
pose of reviewing the First Army Corps.
On their arrival at Farnsborough the par
ty drove to the review plain, where King
Edward, in a field marshal's uniform and
wearing the ribbon of the Legion of
Honor, mounted on a charger and preced
ed by a carriage in which President Lou
bet and Queen Alexandra were seated,
rode to the pavilion. From this point
they- witnessed the review of 16,000 troops
of all arms, which in the bright sunshine
formed an effective picture. After the
King had inspected the troops, the in
fantry marched past in column, "the cav
alry and artillery galloped by and the re
view closed with a general salute. Fol
lowing this the massed bands played
"G;C Save the King" and the "Slar
sellla'-e." On returning to the railroad
statin the p^rty traversed a long ave
nue formed of 116 field and siege guns.
The review attracted great crowds of
srectators, who gave the members of the
party a splendid reception.
The ro/al special train was late In re

had scarcely time to rest before he was
driven to Lord Lansdowne's house, where
he was the guest of the Financial Secre

scarcely less distinguished than that

CHECKERSâ Hix, City. In playing
checkers when one player is in a position
to capture a piece or pieces belonging to
his adversary and he falls to do so. he is
liable to be "huffed," that Is, his oppo
nent may remove the man which the of
fending party should have taken from the
board,' as a penalty for not taking it. In
this game a player has not the option to
refuse to take - when he can, whatever
the consequences may be. The player
who Is In a position to "huff" his adver
sary has, also the option of insisting on
his taking Instead of taking the "huff."
The projected luxury will be a roof garden so con
structed that it can be made to revolve at any rate
of speed desired. Really it is to be two gardens, one
on the ground floor and one elevated to a sufficient
height to command a view of the whole surrounding
country. A report of the enterprise says: "Accord
ing to the elans the outer circle of the lower platform
will revolve at such a rate as will permit any peson
to safely step from the ground to the platform. The
next portion of the platform will revolve at an in
creased rate of speed;. -but such that it can be tra
versed safely to the inner platform, which will re
volve at a yet higher rate of speed, yet enough to
create a cooling breeze. ' This central platform is
connected with the entire upper platform and a
moving stairway will convey patrons from the lower
to the upper platforms without any effort on their
parts. Surrounding and on the platforms tables and
chairs are arranged so that refreshments and meals
may be served.
It will be seen that the scheme promises. to make
the big Ferris wheel, Chicago's boast, look like' thirty
cents. It will be the greatest "merry-go-round" on
record.. One will only have to sit still^and he will
see the whole landscape swing around him as' if it
were strung for a panorama. It will beat swinging
on the gate, and the' yovng men and the maidens of
the exposition will have fleeting hours of joy as. they,
revolve round and round in a kind of waltz that per
mits of enjoying icecream. while waltzing.' .
Just how fast the garden will have to be revolved in
order to get up an exhilarating breeze in the St
SUMMER is always a hot time in St. Louis, and
the people of St. Louis are fully aware of the
fact. They are also aware that if their expecta
tions be realized the summer of 1004, superheated as
it will be in that city by an exposition and a Presi
dential campaign combined, is going to be extremely
sultry for visitors. Hence, like wise'and considerate
hosts, they are already devising ways and means for
cooling off the crowds."
Of course many ways will be devised and many
plans will be tried ; all kinds of iced drinks will be
plentiful and there_will be fans galore, accompanied
by an ample concession to men to wear shirt waists,
but of those we need not speak. One scheme, how
ever, promises to be a novelty of the first class and
a'genuinc treat to the multitude, being nothingness
than a self-cooling garden endowed with power to'
generate its own breezes on the sultriest day of the
season. -

The establishment of professorships of international
law, the history of civilization, American history and
music would not occasion much comment. In one
way or another each of those s'ubjects is already pro
vided for in all of our larger universities. The es
tablishment of a chair o( instruction in public ad
ministration, however, would be a novelty. It might
indeed excite something of derision, for the gradu
ate who came forth from his university with a
diploma certif3'ing his fitness tp fill a public office
might find himself defeated at the polls >every / time
he sought to be elected to the particular office lie
had qualified himself to fill.
There is of course a recognized need of trained
men to fill the various administrative offices of the
nation and cf the States, counties and cities. It is
more than doubtful, however, whether that training
could be successfully given in a university, no matter
how liberal might be the endowment to provide it.
There are some classes of work for which business
experience is\a better training than any that could
be furnished in a lecture-room, and as a rule public
administration is wo^k of that class. -
Mr. White says: "In our courts the university has
a stronghold, but in our county boards, our city
councils, our Legislatures, our Congress and our
seats of executive power I see no such proportion of
university-bred men as every intelligent American
patriot must desire. ? * * Our universities do
rot yet offer their students who wish to enter public
life the instruction which fits them thoroughly for
â¢t. We have magnificent provisions for instruction in
the sciences, in literatu-r, > a!l that DcrtairÂ» to vn
ri us professions. We are rapidly taking the lead of
the world, but I sec no equal provision for fitting men
to grapple with the problems of American politics."
It is quite probable that Mr. White's views on this
subject are affected by what he saw, and learned to
admire in the bureaucratic government of Germany.
Possibly the offices of that country are pretty well
filled by university graduates.' He will have a hard
task, however, in convincing "the American people
that such bureaucratic training would be of advantage
here. At any rate, so long as the attainment of office
in. this country depends mainly on the" ability to
get votes, the first lesson in the -proposed university
course of instruction in the scicnte of filling a pub
lic oif.cv would have to consist of training' in the
iit of getting it
AT the recent meeting at Yale of the famous
class of 1853 Andrew D. White, formerly
United States Embassador to Germany, made
a plea for a new course of instruction at our univer
sities. He believes that the present system of higher
education is defective inasmuch as it gives no train
ing nor culture in the work of public administration,
to which so many Americans are called, and he de
sires that such work be at once provided for by the
establishment of the proper chairs in the larger uni
versities of the country. Millionaires of liberal ten
dencies are invited to contribute to the .foundations.
In presenting his theme Mr. White said the great
est good American millionaires can do to the cause
of education at this time would be to contribute to
the following object?: "1. Endowments in twenty
five American universities of professorships and fel
lowships for instruction in public affairs to fit the
youth of America for office-holding. 2. Professor
s-V^iit and fellowships in twenty-five American univer
sities tor study ?nd teaching in administration. 3. The
establishment on a similarly large scale in American
universities cf professorships in international law.
4. The establishment of twenty-five professorships
iifid fellowships in the history of civilization.
5. Endowments in twenty-five universities for chairs
in American history. 6. Similar endowments in
twenty-five universities for the study of music and
literature as inspiring accompaniments to cine virtue
FOR PUBLIC LIFE
A recent issue of the Manchester Times tells of a
walking match from tha^ city to Southport, a dis
tance of 41H miles. The conditions were that the
contestants were to make it in ten and a half hours
of straight walking. Out of 107 starters no less than
103 completed the distance in the required time, and
it is stated that if the limit had been placed at % l / 2
hours upward of three score corjipetitors would
have qualified for the medal offered. .
Among the successful competitors in the race were
two young ladies. They made the 41J4 mileS \% ten
hours and one minut^and are reported to have come
in looking fine and fresh at the finish. They assert
that they undertook no special training for the walk,
but one of them said: "I put down my success a
great deal to the fact that for a number of years I
have betn studying the art of voice production and
the care of the throat and lungs."
The "hew fad appears to be sweeping the country
like a craze. All kinds of pedestrian tours and
matches are being proposed. It is announced that
the great difficulty' of the matches is found _ in trying
to enforce the rule against running. However, that
does not spoil the fun of the thing, and our British
cousins appear to be haying a great time tramping
from one town to another and witching the country
by their speed and endurance in getting over miles
and .miles of road at something like five miles an
hour all day lone
WHEN golf has run its course and is no
longer a novelty for the amuse'ment of the
smart set and their imitators, it is probable
we shall have a season of walking tours by way of
variety. Most of our social fads come from Eng
land, and England just now is much given to walk
ing. The papers that pay attention to such matters
a're full of reports of long tranips and of arrangements
made for others. The walks vary from twenty- five
to fifty miles, and are seemingly shared in by all
classes and conditions of people. \

PERSONAL MENTION.
THE meeting of the navies in Pechili Bay
probably ha^ no warlike significance. All
the leading powers >have squadrons and
fleets in Eastern waters, and they do there
as elsewhere by periodically- meeting and rais
ing the "pig flag," or heaving-to for "a gam,"
to exchange salutes, calls, dinners and drinks. So
from rear s admirals to jackies the personnel of all the
fleets will meet and mingle on the / waters of far
Pechili, and the occasion aannot be taken by any as
a "demonstration."
Now in diplomacy"a demonstration" is a signifi
cant thing, and may occur by omission. For in
stance, if Russia had been left to occupy Pechili alone
with her fifty-seven warships ii. would have been "a
demonstration," portentous to China and menacing
to the other nations interested in the trade of the
East.- But when we send fifteen warships, the best
in the world and the latest out of actual battle, and
Great Britain, Germany, France and Italy appear un
der full steam, Russia is cheated of her demonstra
tion, and- what would have had a warlike appear
ance becomes as peaceful as an apple bee. It may
well be that while. France and Russia will do their
manners to the other fleets and squadrons, they
really feerthat it is a, case in which "two are com
pany and three a crowd."
The United States has no militant intention,
but just sends Admiral Bob Evans and' the Oregon
and a few more of our sea lions to let the rest of
the world know that Columbia is still the gem of the
ocean. We take tea with lemon juice and butter
with Russia and the sap of the Widow Cliquot with
France in the most peaceable way, but if there
should be a fight involving us in the East we will be
found somewhat prepared.
As for Russia, her recent- diplomacy threatens to
make her the Ananias of nations. The only redeem
ing feature of it is that she shows the newness of her
fall by the bad memory which makes her diplomatic
lies inconsistent with each other. We are glad to
help cheat her out of her costfy demonstration on
Pechili Bay, and will not be^ sorry if some day we
have to besom her fleet off the face of the waters.

1 The object of the opium bill is to create
an opium monopoly in the archipelago and
sell it to the highest bidder. It is based
on the theory that it will restrict the use
of the drug to Chinese, who have used it
a]^ their lives, and prevent Its indiscrim
inate sale to Americans' and 'Filipinos,
many of whom are falling victims to the
use of opium. "Sales of the drug are to be
controlled by a concessionary, who may
acquire the right to sell opium In the isl
ands by bidding for the privilege every
three years. There are, provisions for li
censes and control of the traffic.
MANILA, July S.â Representatives of
the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and
of the Evangelical Union argued for six
hours to-day in opposing the opium^blli
at the public discussion of that measure
on the occasion of its third reading. The
Chinese advocated that there be no
change in the present indiscriminate sale
of opium, with additional Government su
pervision of its importation. The Evan
gelical Union delegates urged the prohi
bition of the sale of opium by the United
States commission and exposed the most
sensational conditions prevailing, alleg
ing that the Chinese are tampering with
the newspapers and raising a fund des
tined to be used In bringing about the
defeat of the bill.
but no doubt a good many visitors will feel dizzy' by
the time they have mixed their mint juleps with the
motion of the garden itself. Gayety and hilarity,
however, will 'rule the soaring crowd,; and it may be
that other cities will with envious haste erect simi
lar gardens of their own, and St. Louis will be fa
mous, honored and imitated even in Chicago.
LORD ROSEBERY has for the S third ;. time
spoken of Chamberlain's tariff* policy with de
rision. In a "speech in the -House of Lords he
| has mocked at the proposed inquiry into the subject
of the commercial and industrial relations of the em
pire with competing nations and with the "colonies."
He has declared that he does not believe any, such
inquiry will take place, and has asserted that the talk
of an, inquiry is designed for no other purpose than
to conceal the weakness of Chamberlain's position
and enable him to get out of a bad blunder.
Perhaps Rosebery may be sincere in his state
ments. He is of nature so critical, so given to
vague academic discussion of political questions, that
it is probably impossible for him to understand' how
any set of men can undertake to carry out a new
enterprise in political life. Chamberlain, however, is
a man of action. From his youth he has been in the
habit of doing things. Between his thoughts and
his will there is a very close connection. He is not
the kind of statesman who can spend^ years halting
and hesitating whether or no he will accept the lead
ership of a party, or not. In short, he is about the
opposite of Rosebery, and consequently the tiling
which Rosebery laughs at as a mere matter of talk is
very likely to be the thing upon which Chamberlain
will stake his political fortunes.
It is to be noted that the statesmen and the papers
of Great Britain do not share Rosebery's derisive
views of the issue. The free-traders have under
taken a vigorous campaign of education in defense of
their policy against the attack which they see to be
inevitable at the next general election. Recently
some fifty cf the Liberal Unionists who in times past
have followed Chamberlain have formed themselves
into ah association to oppose his new policy. At the
jame time other leaders of equal influence have
aligned themselves on his side and are now carrying
the war into Africa. The Parliamentary inquiry will
unquestionably be made, and it will be made as a
matter of practical politics. That much is about as
certain as anything in the future can be.
Recently Sir Gilbert Parker, one of Chamber
lain's ablest supporters, took the matter from Par
liament to the people by submitting resolutions in
dorsing the proposed policy to a m3ss-meeting of his
constituents. His speech is looked upon as impor
tant because it presented what are expected to be the
arguments which Chamberlain will himself rely
upon when appealing to the country.
A summary of the address says: "Taxes on.im
ported food were advocated as an indispensable fis
cal reform, but the explanation was made that the
taxes would be reduced in other directions, espe
cially on tea, coffee, sugar and tobacco, and that the
balance would be effected by the operation of poli
cies of retaliation and negotiation. Ten industries
were enumerated in which there had been an aggre
gate loss of Â£17,000^000 in trade, and the reduction of
the exports of the country under free trade was esti
mated at 30 per cent. Sir Gilbert contended that the
capital and the workmen of the country must be kept
employed and the home market defended against
foreign invasion."
Whatever Rosebery mayahink of such arguments,
they were well received by the masses of Gravesend
to whom they were addressed. It was an audience
largely made up of workingmen whose industries
have been subject to foreign competition and who
will be glad of something in the way of protection.
Moreover, they applauded the proposed reduction of
taxes on tea, coffee, sugar and tobacco, articles which
are so important to the homes of the working
classes. Consequently when at the close of his ad
dress the resolutions asking for an -exhaustive in
quiry concerning the needed measures for checking 1
increasing inroads' into British markets were pre
sented, they were carried by a unanimous vote.
The issue, in short, .is already before the people.
While Rosebery is exercising his subtle intellect in
criticizing this or that phase of the subject Chamber
lain is going ahead with his programme. Some day
Rosebcry will wak,e up to find that what he has
been ridiculing as absurd has become a governmental
policy established by the votes of the British people.

A CHANCE .TOnSMILE
Agitation regarding the currant monop
oly Is daily growing more serious in West
ern Peloponessus of Morea, south of the
isthmus of Corinth. The peasants In tha
neighborhood of Pyrgos are practically
in revolt. They have destroyed the rail
way at several points, because they were
prevented by troops from seizing trains
on which they wished to come to Athens
and represent their views to the King in
favor of granting a monopoly. Many of
the demonstrators at Pyrgos are armed.
They are keeping up a continuous fusil
lade and are parading the town shouting
"The monopoly or death," thereby voic
ing their belief that the granting of the
monopoly is necessary to enable the cur

Prisoners Held to Answer.
That the prisoner cannot be altogether
heartbroken over the week's romance of
three years ago was evinced on April 5
last, when he improved the dull hour 6f
his Imprisonment to marry Miss Teresa
M. Van Velden, a prison missionary.
Miss Norine, when seen at her. home at
944 Van Ness avenue, yesterday, was very
shy about vouchsafing any information
on her new matrimonial venture.. The
mention of "Sir" Harry's name recalled
Incidents to her which sealed her lips
to any statements as to her past adven
ture or her future hopes.
In his cell at the County Jail the man
of many aliases poured his blessings yes
terday on the head of his erstwhile bride.
With a stage tremor In his voice he said:
"Norine is a nice girl. I pray God that
she may be happier with Kelly than she
v/as with me. My name will be a lasting
blight upon her new life if it is associated
with hers. Four months ago, when she
became engaged to the man she is to
marry, she sent him down here to my cell
with a little message, hpping I was hap
py. That is the last word I will ever
hear from her."'
her. They were married before the old
folks could come to shower blessings.
At Ogden the honeymoon was rudely in
terrupted. Men with stars en told the
bride of three days that Ernest was an
ex-convict, his princely fortune in Chan
cery Court a myth, and tho telegram
from mamma his last forgery.
The groom was arrested and convicted
on the forgery charge. Bigamy and per
jury were also arrayed against his name.
To the astounded girl-wife was unrav
eled the tale of the sins of her husband.
Three other girls in turn had borne one of
his many aliases as their own; he had a
record in England and Australia; during
a three years' term in San Quentln; from
which he was released only a month be
fore their marriage, he had been a ring
leader in a plot to murder the guards.
On October 9, 1901, the courts annulled
Norine's marriage. Yesterday her new
lover obtained the license which will em
bark her again on the matrimonial flood.

Alexander O. Richards yesterday filed
an answer and cross-complaint to the ac
tion of divorce brought by his wife, Eliz
abeth. He denies intemperance and other
allegations.' He avers that he Is himself
entitled to a divorce.
Richards says^he was married on May
25 t 1899. and that their first meeting was
through an advertisement. He alleges
that she represented that she had money
and owned property valued at $250,000 and
that she needed a husband to look after
her interests- He further states that he
informed her he had no money and she
replied, "You will not need any money,
as I have enough for us both, more than
we can use," whereupon defendant con
sented to and did marry the plaintiff.
Richards accuses his wife of violating
her marriage vows. . He alleges she vis
ited well-known resorts in this" city and
vicinity, but he is unable to give the
names of men who' accompanied her.^He
further alleges that he has no money, nor
is he physically or mentally able to sup
port himself even though he possessed the
means to do so; that he has always been
dependent upon the bounty, of his mother,
Anna M. Richards, for the necessaries of
living. He asks that he be Eranted a di
vorce.
Detective Pinkerton contemplates re
maining In the city for several weeks.
Mr. Moon, who returned with hfm. Is in

Northern California and unless he
changes his mind he will soon abandon

Francisco his future home.
On top of this news I have been informed of
th* escape last wÂ«Â»ek of Frank Rudolph, who
killed K. A. Schumaker. Itne of the beet men
In the employ of our agencies, this aft*r we had
chased h:m half around the world for a bank
robbery. The day I arrived in 6an Francisco
on my way to the Orient I got a telegram an
nouncing the capture of Rudolph, and I started
across the Pacific happy in the thought that we
would eventual}' put him where he ought to
have bÂ»-en since he began wearing long
lireech*>s. But we will have him again and the
n*-xt time we will taxe good care that he
CToc-pn't escape from his confinement.
1 never had a more enjoyable time In my life,
and the trla was very beneficial to me. Wo
went aÂ« far a* Hongkong and saw all that is
worth seeing. Coming home was a most de
lightful trip, for although the Peking was a
bit elow owing to pome mishap, we were af
forded every i>osElble opportunity for enjoying
ourselves. It is a. fine old ship, and If I had
to make the trip across the Pacific again, which
I bope I will, nothing would suit me better
than to travel on this vessel. She goes along
like an old soldier and cemfs into port with the
air of a major general. A little slow compared
to the Siberia, which carried us over, but she
mits me and she ought to suit any man who is
not over aniious to travel at the mad pace at
which Americans are rapidly accustoming
themselves.
On the return voyage Pinkerton had a
premonition that bad news would be
awaiting here and his fears were real
ized, for he had hardly landed before a
dispatch was handed him announcing
that Harvey Logan, alias Harvey Curry,
a notorious train-robber, whose capture
cost several lives, had made his escape
from the Knoxville prison. Concerning
this news Pinkerton contributed the fol
lowing Interesting information:
I would have foregone my trip willingly If
I could have rreventMl this fellow from getting
out of Jail. My advices are that be was aided
to eseai>e by the guards. He was mixed up in

signed currency, a case which is ?till familiar
to all the people of the Northwest. We finally

him bthind bars for some years to come.
Wearing his usual smile and looking the
picture of health. William Pinkerton, who
has been enjoying a four months' vaca
tion in the Orient, returned yesterday on
the belated steamship Peking, and as
fart as a hack could hurry him he hied
himself to the Palace Hotel, scratched
his Fignature upon the register and then
emitted a sigh that told of the satisfac
tion the noted detective experienced in
being again within bell call of all tha
comforts of a modern American hostelry
and within reach of the world's news.
That "Bill" Pinkerton enjoyed his stay
en the China coast no one thoroughly
acquainted with him doubts, for no mat
ter where he goes he finds the ''amusing
side of life, and the trip over to the other
tide was not an exception. This much is
vouched for by his friend, D. H. Moon of
St. Paul, who accompanied him on the
voyage, and others who chanced to be in
the Orient while the detective was there
have attested that Pinkerton was having
a merry time and making many friends
among- the people on that side of the
world. Speaking of his voyage, 3>Ir.

cup might be safe, buf they are decep
tive. It is apparent that Designer Fife
and Sir Thomas Lipton are experiment-
Ing with the new boat and that changes
are made daily in her ballast and trim
to discover the effect upon her upeed.
On Monday, in the windward work, she
simply outclassed her trial horse. To
day she covered the fifteen miles to the
windward only two minutes and fifty-nine
seconds faster than the Shamrock I. Her
ballast had been moved aft with the re
sult that she could not point so high,
though It did not affect her footing abil

GRAIN MEN TURN
M'NEAR DOWN
Drop His Name Alone
When' Nominating
Directors.
The grain men in the Merchants' Ex
change, outside of the old "big four,"
have turned down George McNear as di
rector of the Exchange. He still occupies
the position of director and is also presi
dent of, the Exchange, out he will not be
re-elected to either position, according to
the present outlook. The by-laws of the
Exchange provide that the president must
be a member of the board of directors.
The committee on nominations, selected
by .the Exchange to name a ticket for
directors for the new term, has brought
in a list which includes the name of every
director now in office, with the exception
of, George W. McNear. To supply the
vacancy caused by this omission the
name of Fairfax Wheelan has been re
ported by the committee.
The nominating committee consists of
Harvey C. Somcrs, W. E. Mighell, H. Sin
sheimer, T. Kruse, E. R. Lilienthal, Si
mon Newman and W. H. Talbot. Â¦ Their
action has caused an immense sensation
in the commercial circles of San Fran
cisco, George W. McNear being the great-'
eat grain man in the State. What more
than anything else gives significance to
the move of the grain men to down Mc-
Near is the fact that under his adminis
tration the erection of the great structure
that is to stand on . Calif ornia and Leides
dorff streets to, house the Exchange was
begun. He is not to be permitted to! be,
the presiding of the Exchange'
while it Is being constructed. â¢
A story has been given currency that
the new board of directors ; of the Ex
change is pledged to r a new policy con
cerning warehousing of grain. There is
nothing to this. The board nominated, as
already stated, is the present one with one
exception. Independent grain, men are
bitter against McNear on account of the
work of the "big four," to which he* was
a party and this is the motive 1 , they say,
that has caused them' tc Â¦: retaliate ; at the
first possible i oportunity. ,

Jimmy Wbtilen shone brightly yesterday
afternoon all through the struggle at
Recreation Park. He had the Senators
tightly tucked away just where he want
'?"d them In every inning and of course
they never had a chance to get even a
man over the rubber. The locals in the
meantime worked well with the club and
managed by artful doings to accumulate
four.
The day was mean and cold, but that
did not stop the Â«'nthusiai?m of the crowd.
As *oon as the fun commenced there was
rooting In plenty. Many exciting plays
were rulled off at about the right time
and all of the*=e the crowd enjoyed.
The home team showed quite a reversal
of form as compared with the showing
they made at Oakland on Tuesday. Every
man on the team was full of ginger and
In the game during each moment of its
course. On the bases they were fast, with
the club they showed fine form and in
the field only one error was committed
and as it was not costly nobody seemed to
notice it much.
The run business was slack for four
innings and a half. In the fifth the first
one was made. Lynch was given a chance
on an error by Doyle. The next two men
went out easily, but Whalen and Shay
rot passes, filling up the sacks. Then
Pat Meany came through with the right
kind of a wallop past short and this
brought Lynch In.
The big tenstrike of the game happened
In the eighth. Then it was that Thomas
got a beating and three runs were the
result. A few errors helped it along. The
Senators made several hard tries to save
themselves from a shutout, but to no pur
pose. The score:

very poor baseball. Spokane tied the score

MALARIA A
Germ Infected Air. P^M
Malaria is not confined exclusively to the swamps Y"&^*&
and marshy regions of the country, but -wherever there is fj^m?|
bad air this insidious foe to health is found. Poisonous k0sMh
vapors and gases from sewers, and the musty air of damp Bif*O^|
cellars are laden with the germs of this miserable disease, i&ipS^f
which are breathed into the lungs and taken up by the Wj^wi â¢
blood and transmitted to every part of the body. Then Â»-^T^M
you begin to feel out of sorts without ever suspecting the w
cause. No energy or appetite, dull headaches, sleepy and w^ll
tired and completely fagged out from the slightest exer- WM'li&
tion, are some of the deplorable effects of this enfeebling W'!<!%
malady. As the disease progresses and the blood becomes rf^vWfh
more deeply poisoned, boils and abscesses and dark or <^Â§^^J-r~^&
yellow spots appear upon the skin. When the poison is
left to ferment and the microbes and germs to multiply in
the blood, Liver and Kidney troubles and other serious complications often
arise. As Malaria begins and develops in the blood, the treatment to be
S^mm^ y^ effective must begin there too. S. S. S. destroys
f^^ lC_^ the germs and poisons and purifies the polluted
V^^ blood, and under its tonic effect the debilitated
hO) K^/ constitution rapidly recuperates and the system is
soon dear of all signs of this depressing disease.

Professor Albert Bushnell Hart of the
University of Chicago spoke on "What
Constitutes tbe Real, tne Genuine Uni
versity." He said the university and its
work are not represented by Its build
ings, but by the work it performs, the
character of the men It sends Into the
world. There are 150,000 students In the
colleges of the United States, against one
tenth that number a hundred years ago.
The speaker declared his belief that there
would be- no more great universities
founded except near some great city, , the
thirty great ones now in existence being
considered sufficient for the present.
Tbe qualities necessary to these novels are.
first, a story, which we get In Mr. Davis'
works; second, great literary simplicity â not
too intricate, too subtle. Great literature
doesn't always owe Us success to Its style. It
Is the idea principally. Even the great novels
have had their day and you'll Hnd they were
all once popular, so called. We should read
these later works aerlously and not deal with
them too Beverely, always keeping in mind
that they are but transient-
Popular novels all have their special theme.
There Is the one founded on the lives of the
great; there Is the one carrying the great and
simple Ideas of reform, such as "Looking
Backward" and "In His 6teDs": thtre Is the
brotherhood of man idea; there is Â»he adven
ture and the historical story. The readers
seem to be Interested in historical people and
especially thcie of America. The idea of ex
treme patriotism that Richard Harding Davis
Incorporates In his books takes welL Then
there is the Idea of the type like that of
"David Harura" and of "The Virginian."
Am I said before, you can scarcely recognize
tbe differences In literature. I am Inclined to
consider all good literature worth reading,
that Is novels as well as the rest. The public
wants to be Interested and amused, and in
these days of Intense activity It hardly has
time to devote to the older works. That Is
why the great body of the people have turned
to tbe popular novel. This la perfectly nat
ural. 1
Professor George Rice Carpenter of Co
lumbia University thinks the popular
novel is not a terrible thing after all. In
fact, he says It is pretty good literature,
and even confesses that he reads a few
himself. The professor put these thoughts
Into words to-day at the second univer
sity meeting of the summer session of the
University of California, where he spoke
on "The Value of the Popular Novel,"
saying in part:
It Is a difficult matter to distinguish exactly
the difference between good and bad reading.
It depends much on tbe taste and previous liau
its and training. A literary scholar considers
novel reading as a light, frivolous, unprofit
able pastime. On the other hand the reader
says the novel Is as good as any kind of read-
Ing. It Is not unusual to hear young people
telling how sweet '"Janice Meredith" was and
how "Ben Hur" Is the best novel In the world.
They like that sort of thing and are whole
somely amused by it.
A s â¢ for myself, I delight in reading the
"Odyssey" and the "Divine Comedy." They
are my favorites. But I confess I am fond of
a good novel, and I read one whenever I find
one that ts entertaining. I seldom buy any,
for the circulating library is good enough for
me.

ferred by me against Harvey Sellgman, under
the name of John Do* Sellcman. I am the
aggrieved party to said action and have re
ceived full satisfaction for the Injury by the

CHINESE CONVICT CUTS
A FELLOW PRISONER
The railroad company charged that the
ill-fated passenger was Injured because of
her own negligence In swinging out from
the steps just as the meeting car passed.
After the verdict .was rendered through
E. B. Thompson, foreman of the jury,
the attorneys agreed to a sixty days'
stay of execution, pending a motion by
the railroad company for a new trial and
for appeal, if that be denied.
The trial reached the point of closing
argument this morning. In the midst of
Attorney Chapman's speech. Miss James
was overcome and fainted in her sister's
arms, and Judge Melvm ordered a recess
until the overwrought plaintiff regained
her senses. The strain of the trial and
the vividness of the picture drawn by the
lawyers proved too severe for the un
fortunate and maimed young plaintiff.
The accident that marred Miss James*
beautyâ and but for superb surgical work,
meant her deathâ occurred three years
ago, while she was riding home on an
electric car from Berkeley. She was
standing on the crowded platform and
was pitched off, her head striking a win
dow of the car that was coming in an
opposite direction. One of her cheeks was
severely torn, causing a jagged hole in
her face, her teeth were knocked out, and
one leg was broken.
Dr. William S. Porter took charge of
the patient at the Receiving Hospital.
By a successful grafting of the flesh of
her arm to the cheek, the injury was re
paired. During the trial tbe attorneys ad
mitted as a part of the evidence that the
operation required the highest surgical
skill.
Attorneys George W. Reed and M. C.
Chapman of this city conducted the trial
for Miss James, and Harmon Bell was
the counsel for the railroad company. On
both sides the case was fought with skill.
The contestants made it one of the cele
brated tourneys at the Alameda County
bar. - -
After a hard legal battle lasting three
weeks, Rosle James, X7 years old, was
given a verdict for 115,000 damages in her
suit against the Oakland Transit Consoli
dated. The verdict was returned to-day
in Superior Judge Henry A- Melvin'a
department.
The recorded award is one of the larg
est ever rendered in a railroad damage
case in Alameda County. The main point
was the unanimous expression of the
jury, whose only differences of opinion
developed concerning the amount of the
award.
Eleven ballots were taken before the
definite sum was agreed upon, and the
views of the jurors ran even as high as
$50,000, the amount specified in the com
plaint. On the first ballot two jurors
voted for that figure. One vote for $30,000
was recorded, and four jurors believed
$25,000 would be the right sum. From the
outset of the balloting every juror favor
ed the young woman's case.

Mrs. Sarah J. Richardson, whose death
occurred last evening at her residence,
753 Webster street, after a sudden attack
of heart disease, was one of the pioneer
women of California. For more than half
a century this estimable woman had lived
in the Golden State, arriving in San
Francisco in 1S53 with her father, James
Clinton, who was identified with the
earliest growth of the metropolis and the
cities on the east side of the bay.
The father began work on an extensive
plan of cutting thoroughfares through
Telegraph Hill, San Francisco, but obsta
cles arose which proved Insurmountable,
and Clinton was compelled to abandon
the project, suffering heavy financial
losses. In 1S54 the family settled on a
ranch in the Berkeley foothills. Mrs.
Richardson as a child saw the ceremony

In the little settlement which has become
the important college town of Berkeley.
Mrs. Richardson was among the first
pupils of the public schools of California,
and in childhood attended tbe San Fran
cif co schools.
-Â»Irs. Richardson was married In 1S59.
Her husband, John H. Richardson, who
died in 1874, was a prominent mill, owner
of this city. During the many years of
her residence in Oakland Mrs. Richard

MILL VALLEY PREPARES
A UNIQUE SOCIETY EVENT
GRASS VALLEY. July 8.â William J.
Martin, a miner, had $lS00 of his hard
earned coin stolen, but he did not find 1
it out until to-day, when he went to tpe
place where he had buried It and found
it gone. His father-in-law, William Key,
had burled a large amount of money a
short distance from Martin's, but this
remained untouched. Tbe money stolen
represents the savings of years of work
in the mines and Martin naturally feels
very blue over his loss. An attempt was
also made to find the gold of John Mar
tin, who lived a block away from his
brother, but the robbers were unsuccess
ful. The last Martin saw of his gold was
at Christmas time. A day or two ago he
decided to make an' Investigation and
when he dug up the box the gold was
missing. Now the Martins are sitting up
nights awaiting the return of the robbers. I
Special Dispatch to The Call
Boodling, according to the Senator, orig
inated in the early nineties and grew to
enormous proportions before the time he
left the Senate.
Lancaster said that boodle came to be
known -as "driftwood," and when things
became dull a boodle agent would be sent
to St. Louis or Kansas City to "start the
driftwood down." *.Â»e agent, if success
ful in his mission, would wire back:
"River rising: driftwood coming fast;
win be there to-morrow."
Boodle, In the later years of his ser
vice, said Lancaster, was used in almost
everything tnat came up for passage.
ComDines were regularly formed and
agents appointed to solicit, the bribes.
The legislators Introduced 'bills called
"sand- baggers." which they never intend
ed to pass, for the purpose of holding up
those who were the most easily worked
for bribes.
ST. LOUIS, July 8.-The Grand Jury to
day took up the Investigation of the re
port that money was used to accomplish
the defeat in the Legislature of the bill
placing the office of Excise Commissioner
on a salary and thereby reducing Its oc
cupant's Income. R. D. Lancaster of St.
Louis and Charles E. Peers of Warren
ton, Mo., both former State Senators, and
Dennis Devoy, a lawyer, were examined
this afternoon. ..lore than one attempt
has been made to place the excise office
on a salary , but enough votes could never
be mustered in the Legislature to do so.
Lancaster placed the average Income of
a boodling Senator during the year when
sessions of the Legislature were held at
$4000. Lancaster slaced the amount of
boodle that it took at one session to keep
the office of excise commissioner from be
ing placed on a salary basis at $10,000.
The money he alleged, changed hands in
1897.

PORTLAND. Or.. July 8.â The Ore
gonlan estimates tne wheat crop of .Ore
gon. Washington and Idano for the cur
rent vear at 36,000,000 bushels, or nearly
6,000,000 bushels below the crop of last
year. Under the present . conditions a
rough estimate places the crop of Oregon
at 11,500,000 bushels; Washington, 20,500,000
bushels, and Idaho at 4,000,000 bushels.
TACOMA, Wash., July 8.â The prospects
for the Washington wheat crop are im
proving, according to advices received
from west of the mountains by State
Grain Inspector Arrismith. There have
been fine rains and the weather is re
ported fairly cool, with southern winds,
which are the desirable winds for the
wheat crop in that section of the coun
try.
If conditions remain favorable for an
other two weeks the danger will be prac
tically over and the crop will be greatly
benefited. Ten days ago conditions point
ed to a yield of about 75 per cent of last
year's crop, but if these favorable condi
tions continue for another two weeks a
considerably heavier yield may be ex
pected, possibly 80 per cent of last year's
record.
United States Consul Swalm of South
ampton responded to the toast, "The
President of the United States," and Lieu
tenant Commander N. W. Wood of the
San Francisco responded to the toast of
"The United States Navy."
Altogether 800 Americans were guests
at the luncheon. The procession to and
from the hall was headed by the band
from the Kearsarge and the Americans
were welcomed by genuine enthusiasm
from large crowds.
The luncheon at the rifle hall was fol
lowed by a matinee performance of "The
Lady Slavey" at the Theater Royal,
which was witnessed by large detach
ments from all the crews of the American
squadron. After that the visitors attend
ed the unveiling by the Mayoress of a
memorial statue to Queen Victoria.
The luncheon which the Pilgrims' Club
will give to the American officers to-mor
row will be one of the most Interesting
functions of their visit to England. Such
a ntimber of representative British and
American officers has seldom been seen
together. All of the navy and army of
ficers will be In uniform. Vice 'Admiral
Lord Charles Beresford will preside., On
his right will be Rear Admiral Cotton and
on his left Captain Prince Louis of Bat
tenberg.
The 1500 officers and men remaining at
Portsmouth are being entertained in va
rious ways. Including a luncheon at the
Volunteer Rifle Hall, at which the Mayor
presided. In toastlne King Edward the
Mayor said he believed his Majesty's ef
forts to promote friendship and good will
between Great Britain and other coun
tries were fully appreciated by the United
States. Toasting President Roosevelt,
the Mavor said:
He is held here in the highest esteem and re
gard. The President labors mont assiduously
to promote the welfare of the United States,
and, further, is actuated by a sincere desire to
Etrengtnen the bonds of friendship and concord
uniting the two countries. We on this side of
the Atlantic, sharing with you, representatives
of the great nation across the pea*, a common
heritage and speaking the same language, honor
your President for the grand work In which he
is engaged, and which, we are persuaded, is
not only conducive to the best interests of the
United States and Great Britain, but must ad
vance the cause of civilization, freedom and
justice the world over.
The final toast was to the United States
navy. In which the Mayor cordially wel
comed the visit of the United States Eu
ropean squadron to Portsmouth as being
further proof of the friendly feeling of
President Roosevelt.

LONDON, July 8.â King Edward signal
ly honored the officers- of the American
squadron to-night at the state ball given
in Buckingham Palaceâ the climax of the
visit of President Loubet. The King
formally received Admiral Cotton, the
captains of the American ships and twen
ty-flve of the junior American officers,
and Queen Alexandra later gave them the
same distinction. The ballâ the first since
the succession of King Edwardâ was a
brilliant function, 2200 guests being pres
ent, including President Loubet and his
suite, practically all of the Embassadors
and Ministers in London, the majority of
the members of the royal family, prom
inent representatives of the nobility and

There were five arrests to-day on Grand
Jury indictments for the rioting Monday
night. Those under arrest are Richard
Grosbeck, late Socialist candidate for City

EVANSVILLE, Ind., July 8.-Governor
Durbin late to-night, upon learning that
Judge Rasch had ordered the negro Lee
Brown brought back here for immediate
trial, wired Judge Rasch that he would
not allow the prisoner to be taken from
the State institution at this time. Judge
Rasch immediately on receipt of the Gov
ernor's order wired Sheriff Kratz to re
turn here without the prisoner. He said
the trial would be Indefinitely postponed.
It is probable that the troops will be sent
back home to-morrow night.
Thfee years ago when President Hays
was at the head of the Harrlman road,
plans for securing rights of way between
Sacramento and Stockton were discussed
by the directors of the company and
steps were taken toward forming a com
pany of which several of the same gen
tlemen who have been named as stock
holders in the present company were
chosen for similar purposes. The pro
ject, however, was never carried out. for
President Hays resigned a few weeks
later. It was intimated yesterday by one
high in the councils of the Southern Pa
cific that there is no intention of build
ing the road for which the latest com
pany has been incorporated, for some time
at least, and possibly not at all. It was
admitted that a new line would not ma
terially shorten the route between Sac
ramento and Stockton, nor would it give
the company any additional advantage
from a traffic standpoint through the
section of the State which the line would
be expected to extend. Another point
developed was that the Union Trust
Company, which, through I. W. Hellman
Jr.,, appears as the principal stockholder,
has not contracted to float any bonds, a
fact that would suggest that the enter
prise is not the creation of outside people
but purely a Southern Pacific scheme to
anticipate any possible motives of its
rivals.
OLD SCHEME BEVTVED.
There no longer exists in the minds of
local railroad people a doubt that the
Southern Pacific is behind the company
which was . incorporated yesterday to
build a road from Sacramento to Stock
ton.
Phil K. Gordon, local agent for the
Piedmont Air Line, has gone to Los An
geles on a peculiar mission. Under in
structions of the chief of the advertis
ing bureau of his road, he is looking for
a model of a typical creole girl, with a
view of using her photograph for a
fancy poster which the Piedmont Line
purposes to issue in California.
W. B. Story, chief engineer of_the
Santa Fe road. A. W. Walker. AT"D~.
Schindler, William S. Tevls. president
of the Richmond belt road. H. C
Breeden and other directors of that com
pany yesterday made * tour of inspec
tion over the new line at Richmond,
which is nearly completefl.
A. M. Brown, general freight and pas
senger agent of the El Paso Northeast
ern, which is part of the Rock Island
system, is expected in the city to-day.
His presence on the coast is for_the
purpose of looking into the fruit "and
vegetable product outlook for next sea
son, for it is the intention of his road,
in conjunction with the Rock Island, to
bid for a portion of the hauling of these
commodities.
During his connection with the South
ern Pacific Company Morse did much
toward developing the southern portions
of Texas and Louisiana, and it is
thought here that possibly this fact may
have suggested to Traffic Manager Se
bastian of the Rock Island road the ad
visability of securing the services of a
man of Morse's capacity to aid the plans
of that company In capturing the busi
ness of its new territory.
INSPECT BELT ROAD.
Much speculation is going on in local
railroad circles over tne probable suc
cessor to S. F. B. Morse, who several
days ago resigned the position of assist
ant passenger traffic manager of the
Southern Pacific Company, with head
quarters at Houston. Texas. As yet no
explanation has come from Chicago or
Houston as to why Morse retired from
the position in which he made himself
so valuable to the company and in which
he earned a wide reputation as a traffic
man. One of his friends here received
recently a letter in which Morse stated
that he had been made a proposition by
Sully, the big cotton operator, to enter
into a private enterprise, but* it is not
supposed that such a step would neces
sitate Morse's retirement from the
Southern Pacific Company.
There came yesterday through private
sources from Chicago a story that Morse
had been offered a high position in thÂ«
passenger traffic department of the Rock
Island Company. Some credence is given
to the story in view of the fact that the
latter road has just finished a line into
El Paso, and is making preparations to
compete for the traffic in that State and
the adjoining ones.
WATSONVILLE. July 8.â A head-on
collision occurred on the Southern Pacific
Company's coast line at Aromas at 12:40
p. m. to-day between trains S3 and 24, re
trectlvely the north and south bound
passenger trains. Twelve persons were
slightly injured and one child was seri
ously hurt when the engines met. They
were thrown out of their seats by the
force of the collision. The train for San
Francisco received orders at Pajaro to
F'detrack at Aromas, but instead of tak
ing the switch at that point continued
psFt the target and crashed Into the
Fouthbound train, which was almost at a
standstill on the main line ju?t north of
the switch. That a terrible disaster was
avoided is owing to the caution of the
? r.ginecr having the right of the track.
There is a heavy curve on the main line
at that point, and when the engineer and
fireman of the northbound train discov
ered the mistake in their calculations
they jumped to the ground, as did also
the crew of the other engine, and let the
trains meet. Both engines were badly
smashed, as was also the baggage car of
the southbound train.
The engine of the Santa Cruz passenger
tiain, which was waiting at Pajaro, was
Beat to the scene of the wreck and moved
the damaged rolling stock to Pajaro. The
passengers for the north were taken on
an engine which was sent out from Gll
iov. The northbound train was running
at about thirty miles an hour at the time
of the collision.
It was reported here to-night that one
of the passenpers. a young lady, was
mere severely injured than at first report
ed. It is said that she struck her back
against the edge of a seat when the col
lision occurred and so badly jarred heÂ»
ppine that she has since suffered a para
lytic stroke. The child reported injured
i* said to be in a dying condition. Tha
:;ames of the injured cannot be learned at
this point.

BABY WEATHER.
Little Fellows Don't T*ke the Hot
Days.
Mothers should know exactly what food
to give babies in hot weather.
With the broiling hot days In July and
August the mother of a baby is always
anxious for the health of her little one
and is then particularly careful in feed-
ing. Milk sours quickly and other food
is uncertain. Even in EDlte of caution,
sickness sometimes creeps in and then
the right food is more necessary than
ever.
"Our baby boy. 2 years old. began In
August to have attacks of terrible stom-
ach and bowel trouble. The physician
:aid hi* digestion was very bad and that
:f it had been earlier in the summer
and hotter weather we would surely have
lest him.
"Finally we gave baby Grape-Nuts
food, feeding it several times the first
day, and the next morning he seemed
better and brighter than he had been for
many days. There was a great change
in the condition of his bowels and In
three days they were entirely normal.
He is now well and getting very strong
and fleshy and we know that Grape-Nuts
caved his life, for he was a very, very 111
baby. Grape-Nuts food must hive won-
derful properties to effect cuch cures as
this.
"We crown-ups in our family all use
Grape-Nuts and also Postum in place of
coffee, with the result that we never any
of us have any coffee Ills, but are well
and strong." Name given by Postum Co.,
Battle Creek. Mich.
The reason Grape-Nuts food relieves
bow/rl trouble In babies or adults is be-
caule the starch of the grain is predi-
gested and does not tax the bowels, nor
ferment like white bread, potatoes and 1
other forms of starchy food.

of Peking landed yesterday at the
Pacific Mail wharf. Except for its length
the voyage was uneventful and only those
passengers whofe business affairs suf
fered from the delay minded the slow
passage. The City cf Peking, old and in
firm as she is, is still fairly comfortable
for the passenger with plenty of time and
the aim of whose voyaging is more a mat
ter of sea air than rapid transit. Thirty
years of active service has left the liner
tired out and Irresponsive to ths encroach
ment cf hot fires and rushing steam. In
addition to the weight of years she drag
ged across the Pacific on her voyage just
ended as elaborate a growth of marine
vegetation and shells as ever get clutch
on a chip's bottom. As soon as her car
go is discharged ?he will be placed on
Hunters Point Orydoek and there reeive
the ministrations cf scrapers and
painters in preparation for another
voyage. The China, in whose place the
Peking is Failing, is not yet ready to go
into commission, therefore the Peking will
make one more Oriental trip.

BIG BRITISH TRAMP STEAMSHIP HEATHDEXE. WHICH ARRIVED IN PORT YESTERDAY AFTER'A TWEN
TY-THREE DAYS' JOURNEY FROM KARATSU, JAPAN, WITH A CARGO OF 5000 TONS OF COAL FOR
DISTRIBUTION IN THE LOCAL MARKET.
The alleKnt'or.s in the complaint are
said to be of a moat sensational charac
ter, but the papers have not yet been
made public. Judge Gaddis' heard the
complaint and petition in chambers and
upon the representation of the plaintiff
that the defendant is squandering her
money and that she is dependent upon
it for support and maintenance, appoint
ed W. L. Wood receiver. Hankel refused
to obey the order of the court and refused
to give the receiver the combination to
the safe. Both parties claim to bo in pos
session to-night. Interesting develop
ments are expected in court to-morrow.
WOODLAND, July S.-Sensational di
vorce proceedings were commenced here
this afternoon. A few months ago Carl
Hankel of Woodland was married to Miss
Georgia Brown, only daughter of E. W.
Brown, a wealthy resident of Davisville.
Brown put 14000 in the hands of Hankel
for the henefit of Mrs. Hankel, and they
leased the Byrns t one of the leading ho
tels of. the Sacramento Valley. There
have been rumors of discord and disa
greement for some time, but few people
thought that either party would resort
to such heroic measures.
Sensational Divorce Complaint Is
Filed by Mrs. Carl Hankel
of Woodland.
WIFE CLAIMS HUSBAND
SQUANDERS HER MONEY
The Standard Oil Company was as
signed 200 feet of inner berth space et the
south side of the new wharf at the foot
of Sixteenth street. The privilege of
placing two pipe lines under the wharf
poes with the assignment. The sum of
5C2 50 a month, exclusive of tolls and
dockage, is to be paid for the berth.
The Union Oil Company was assigned
400 feet of berth space on the south side
of the same wharf at a rental of J125 a
month, exclusive of tolls and dockage.
Pipe line privileges and rights of way
for a spur track from the Santa Fe line
go with the assignment. John Baker Jr.
of the Union Oil Company wanted the
board to guarantee twenty-five feet of
Â¦water.
Commissioner Kirkpatrick said he would
vote against any assignment containing
a stipulation as to depth of water. Com
mirsioner Mackenzie was not ready to
guarantee twenty-five feet. President
SpÂ«ar declined to entertain any deep
water proposition. Mr. Baker wanted
something more for his 5125 a month than
berth space of 400 feet, pipe line privileges
and railroad track concessions. He
asked if exclusive privileges went with
the assignment. The president replied:
"The form of assignment provides that
we can use the berth when you are not
using: it."
Chief Wharfinger Welch reported that
the west side of Steuart-street wharf
could be made available and the board
resolved to utilize the valuable space.
The^onipenmlon of two blacksmiths
was raised to J4 a day.
The Board of State Harbor Cotnmis
sicners met yesterday afternoon. Percy
Henderson was appointed to audit tolls
during the pleasure of tim ooard. Tho
compensation was fired at 5200 per month.
The Cornrclssi oners apprehend that it
is prudest to establish a system where
by the anour.t of freight discharged at
the various wharves extending over a
space of seven m!le3 may be accurately
ascertained. Hitherto the report from
the chip has been accepted without veri
fication.
JeOrson TVhite cf LiCS'Angelcs was ap
poiKfeo" collector, vice J. A. Sullivan. The
salary attaching to the position is $100 a
month.
Walter F. X. Parker cf Los Angeles
visJted tfce office of the board yesterday
afternoon.
Attorcej- Dcvsa reported that the beard
had the right to rise a certain described
block on the water front for a free mar
ket. Secretary Foy reported that new
insurance approximating 530,000 had been
placed on new wharves and offices be
longing to the State.
ESTIMATES FOB IX)CKS.
Chief Engineer Norton was directed to
prepare estimates for two new docks for
the Pacific Mali Steamship Company.
Kach wharf will be 123 feet wide and 800
feÂ«>t long. The Commissioners briefly con
sidered the advisability of establishing aji
independent electric plant for lighting
State properly. The bills for Ught
amount to Â£23,000 per annum.
Commissioner Kirkpatfick said the Pal
ace Hotel, using more than 7000 lights,
did net pay 525,000 a yecr. The Commis-
Fior.crs will ascertain the number of
liglits used by the State, and also obtain
from an expert figures relating to the
< xpense of installing and operating a
piant.
Bids as follows were received for re
constructing Fremont-street wharf:
Dundon Bridge and Construction Company.
t5l'J0 30; Atlantic. Gulf and Pacific Company.
flO.fiK; Hyd* Construction Company. Â£9351 50;
Darby I^aydon $10,134; City Strret Improve
ment Company, 5902?. f>4; S. D. Le Clair,
$Â«S*5 80; James A. ilcMahon. $0891 TO.
The contract was awarded to S. D. L#e
C.air. the lowest bider.
Informal bids for 260 tons of cement
were opened. The proposals were: E. B.
& A. L. Stone Company, SU 72 per ton;
J. D. Bpreckcls Bros. & Co., $11 90 per
ton; W. It. Grace, $13 70 per ton. When
Tbe figures were disclosed it was ascer
tained that the cost of the entire quan
tity on the lowest bid would be $3047 23â
or $47 20 in excess of the amount the
Commissioners could expend without ad
vertising for bids. Mr. Stone of Oakland,
representing' the lowest bidders, was quite
willing to relieve the board of embarrass
ment by knocking off $4" CO from his bid.
The Commissioners referred the subject
to Attorney Davis and the legal counselor
did not commend such action. All the
proposals were set aside and other infor
mal bids will be solicited. Tbe cement
is needed for the new ferry slip.
ROOM FOB OIL COMPANIES.
With reference to the complaint of Mr. Pot
ter regarding the publicity given to the matter.
1 have to state that Information as to such
matters should not be given to the public press
by customs officials unless or until it Is clearly
apparent that there was a willful Intent to
violate the revenue laws.
Mr. Potter is one of the commissioners
for the St. Louis Exposition.
The Secretary of the Treasury: has in
structed Acting Customs Collector Hamil
ton to remit the fine of |651 heretofore Im
posed upon Henry 8. Potter, a passenger
on the America Maru, In whose baggage
several undeclared dutiable articles were
found of the total value of $a7. The Sec
retary states that Mr. Potter had no in
tention of concealing the goods for the
purpose 1 of evading the payment of the
duty. .':'.v
Mr. Potter and his wife left for the
Orient on the steamship Coptic on March
18 with two trunks.. They /returned with
three trunks and three valisea.
The report of Customs Inspector Joseph
Head, made to the Collector of the Port
et the time the undeclared goods were
found in the Potter baggage, reads as fol
lows:
Part of the goods we found concealed In the
sleeves and folds of the garments in the pas
sengers* baggage. None of the said articles
were entered and declared ln / the annexed en
try of baggage declaration provided for such,
purposes. The attempted and the
taiiure to enter or declare said goods was an
evident intent to evade payment of the duties.
Among: the" undeclared articles were
doilies, drawn work, kimonos and other
articles of use and ornament. V? '

Treasury contains this paragraph:

New York Cotton Market .
NEW YORK. July 8.â Professional traders
made another unavailing attempt to awaken
some degree of activity in the stock market
to-day. During the early market the. rate of
activity was tqual to the expanded dealings
of the latter part of yesterday, but the sub
sequent relapse was in such a complete stag
nation that the total dealings for the day
dropped back to about the lowest level for the
year. In the light of this morning's develop
ments yesterday's list drive in United States
Steel stocks stemed to have no other purpose
than to have a better vantage ground for an
upward start. The statement cf the corpora
tion's earnings for the quarter Just pacsed
with Its decrease of over $1.200.000. from the
corresponding quarter of last .year was no
worse than had been expected and the slight
increase reported in June estimated earnings
compared with June earnings of last year was
regarded as a favorable feature. The com
mon and preferred stocks were lifted about a
point on the strength of this showing. In thÂ«
active railroad lint. St. Paul and Missouri Pa.
clfic were the only stocks to gain as much ai
this. The further engagement of $1,600.00Q
gold for export and the early sharp rally In
the cotton .market eeemed to have no effect
in checking the rise in stocks. It was after
cotton had reacted that the unresponslveness
of the stock market to the stimulation of light
professional buying was perceived. Prices
thereupon sagged off and the whole market fell
back into its rut cf stagnation. Reports have
been current lor sex'eral days that insiders were
buying Erie stocks on the certainty that the
directors to-day would advance the first re
ferred dlvidÂ«id to 4 per cent, and declare a
2 per cent dividend on the second preferred.
Credulous traders who have followed this "In
side" baying learned to-day tin inquiry that
no directors' meeting iÂ« in contemplation for
three weeks. The Incident is characteristic
of the present market, but so far as can b*
judged from the resulting movement in the
stocks these rumors have done no irreat harm
nor conferred any great benefit on anybody.
The rally In the cotton market Is regarded as
a natural Incident of the process of settlement
to a normal basts in that market, but until
the settlement Is completed the expected bene
fits to the financial and general business struc
ture are not likely -to become evident. The
favorable crop weather was o!Tset by the ex*
pressive firmness In the wheat market and the
profit-taking reaction in corn did not entirely
relieve the fear that the Government crop re
port, due on Friday, will make an unpromis
ing showing for that crop. Further weakness
in the International Mercantile Marine on the
curb helped to disturb sentiment. There was
also a further clump in Standard Rope and
Twine issues, but a pretty effectual recovery
followed. It is significant of the prevailing
dullness of business that many stock broker
age houses are largely reducing their clerical
forces.
Active railroad bonds were pretty steady,
but high grade Inactive issues are settling to
a lower price basis. The New York Central
mortgage S'.^s. which sold last wrek as low as
par for the first time In their history, sold
to-day at 97. Total tales, par value. $1,115,
000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
thÂ» last call. . .
Trading on the Stock Exchange to-day was
thÂ« lowest in three years, total sales being
but 173,785 shares.

r : eculation as to the course of
tr.\de during the next six
months.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
' TtÂ» first six months cf 19C3 have been a per
iod of Kim and thorough liquidation. What
about the next s:x month*? The reaction fol
lowing the underwriting and speculative crate
of 1001-2 cam* sooner ihan anticipated, as re-
BCi.ic.ng of that nature invariably do; and the
(jueftioQfe now pr<*sflng fcr solution are: Has
the reaction culminated: is liquidation over;
is the readjustment between supply and de
mÂ»Â»;a. or between quantity and value, com
plete? To be perfectly frank, we do not think
the adjustment Â¦Â« complete. A number of good
*-Â«car:tie* have come down to Intrinsic valuts,
where investors ion take hold with confidence,
tut there are still many of the newer crea
tions eellinc at inflated figures â held tip by
fhetr torce â which have yet to face the test
oÂ£ trade reaction or diminished profits. It is
i>j*t here that careful judgment must be ex
vÂ»v!M?d in estimating the future of the stock
market. While the period of special stress j
in financial circles is over; while the situation ;
if better than it was eix months ago; while
ail proionged downward movements are ac
t â¢Â»->'. by rallies such as the present, still
these facts furnish very little guidance as to
w-fcst may be expected between now and the
il^se of 1903. As we have stated in previous.
ndUces. the dominating factors will be the
>.rc] â¢ ar.d money.
â¢In the crop outlook there is nothing dl*
.:....:Â¦*. except backwardness. In the case
ol ccrn this is cf consequence, because
:t incrtast-s the danger from frost, and the
;:l r.gt-d absenre of high temperature is un
:&vorable to corn. Six cr eight weeks or
warm weather, however, would work great
barges in this crop. For wheat we are prac
ti.-a!iy cur* of a plentiful harvest, together
r. :â¢*; a good exjvDrt demand at profitable prices.
Cottoa i* &\io backward, but as a result the
plant h*s good roots, is vigorous, and under
tiiwalie v. eather conditions could produce a

n-.c;. be ftmsifl uj> in the etatement that good j
..- uortOMi weather during the remainder of

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
'. Feedstuffs show no further change. , Hay, is
coming in freely and is easy. The circular of
Somers & Co. says:
"Owing principally to the recent holidays.
shipments of Hay have been lessened somewhat
during the past week, the total for the week
ending to-day amounting to 8200 tons, in com
parison with 3900 tons for the week preceding.
To-day's receipts were especially light, pwlng
principally to the fact that at most stations
yesterday very few empty cars were furnished.
This car shortage is the most serious obstacle
that both dealers and producers have to face.
Although the crop can b* very closely esti
mated and the demand quite accurately fore
judged, yet the market will have little stability
and prices may at. times be entirely different
from what they should bÂ« if the Hay cannot
be marketed in proportion to the quantity to
be shipped or as ths demand requires it. The
only measure of relief afforded this season Is
the fact that quite a large portion of the cÂ»op
was raised In localities that have water com
munication with San Francisco. A large fleet
of boats Is now working on -Hay and will con
tinue to do sd' for several months to come.
â¢Â¦â¢ "The general tendency of, tae market at pres
ent is downward, and if ears could be supplied
to bring in- what la.walting to be shipped at
the various stations we might be somewhat
overburdened with" Hay. It is Impossible to
foretell just what the market will be -during
the next month or two, for. as reported above,
everything depends on transportation facilities
furnished by the railroads. Prices show very
little /change from the quotations given last
wrek. Very little alfalfa Is coming to mar
ket. â¢ most -of the farmers holding for higher
prices, which, with the abundance of cow Hay
and the decrease in dairy trade, will hardly
be forthcoming this season- 6t~Â»w Is holding
quite firmly, but will probably weaken some
what with the advent of tha new crop later
in the month." Â¦ Â¦ ' . Â¦'

2215 Shattuck avenue held up a Telegraph
avenue streetcar 'this morning with the
butt end of a 22-callber rifle. He did not
do it with the hope of Rain, but because
he was angry and In fear of his life.
Wright was driving, along Shattuck ave
nue between the car tracks and a pile of
earth. A car came along and bore dowir
on him so quickly that he was crowded
against the embankment before he could
get out of the way. Just then he hit upon
the device of hurling the rifle he carried
with him at the motorman's head. In
stead of hitting the motorman, however,
the rifle's butt end struck a window and
went through It, scattering glass In all
directions. That brought the car to a
standstill and prevented an accident.

Gunboat Concord Returns to Vallejo.
' VAL.LEJO. July 8.â The gunboat Con
cord unexpectedly returned here to-day
and is tied up alongside the navy yard.
There are different stories afloat as to
the cause of her return. It Is stated by
some that the ship condenser does not
work properly, although it is claimed the
Concord was put in excellent trim before
she left the navy yard. Others say that
ships' are often hurried away from the
navy yard before their machinery Is
thoroughly tested and slight defects are
likely to appear a little later. -
Los Angelean Dies in a Saloon.
SEATTLE, July S.-George I* Bcattie
was locked up in the Ruby saloon last
night, and when the proprietor opened
the place to-day he found Beattie dead in
a chair. From papers on his person it
was ascertained that Beattie comes of
wealthy parents in Los Angeles. A cut
over the eye and one on the Jaw led to
some doubt on the part of the Coroner as
to Beattie's manner of death, and a post
mortem examination of the body was
held. It was ascertained that Beattie
came to his death from natural causes.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July 8.
Superior Judge Elijah Hart of Sacra
mento,' who decided the water rates suit
in favor of the Contra Costa Water
Company, has indicated his desire not to
come to Oakland to settle the bill of ex
ceptions, which step is preliminary to
preparation of the engrossed transcript
on appeal to the Supreme Court.
In a letter to City Attorney McElroy,
received to-day, Judge I Hart suggests
that he would be pleased to place himself
at the disposal of the attorneys at a time
to be fixed upon during this month, as
hi will take a vacation in August.
But Judge Hart notes that the papers
in the case are at Sacramento and in his
possession and that that city would be a
convenient place to attend to the legal
formalities. Both the bill of exceptions
as prepared by the city's counsel and the
amendments thereto offered by the wa
ter company's attorneys were filed a week
ago with County Clerk Cook. The clerk
properly forwarded the bulky records to
Judge Hart.
City Attorney McElroy said to-night
that he would at once communlcate^with
Attorney McCutchen, the water com
pany's counsel, with tho view of fixing a
convenient date to meet Judge Hart at
Sacramento.
"I should prefer as early a date as pos
sible," said the City Attorney, "that the
case may reach the Supreme Court with
out delay."
In this suit Attorney Carl Abbott is
special assistant to the City Attorney.
Prefers to Remain in Sacra
mento Rather Than to
Go to Oakland.
Judge Hart Is Ready to
Settle Exceptions in
Water Case.
ASKS LAWYERS
TO NAME A DAY
SUICIDE LEAVES LITTLE
CLEW TO HIS IDENTITY
Address* Found in His
Pocket. .
Supposed to Be J. H. Mayers From
A suicide with no identification other
than the words "J. H. Mayers, 648 How
ard street," written On a slip of paper
In his pocket, died at the Central Emer
gency Hospital at about 8 o'clock last
night as the result of a pistol shot wound
in the temple. He was found in a bath
room at 208 Third street and died with
out gaining consciousness.. ;
Roughly dressed and evidently a Swede
of the laboring class, beyond the name
on the slip of paper In the suicide's pock
et no other clew to his Identity could be
discovered. The man was of perfectly
sound and even robust physique and it
is therefore not supposed that mental or
physical disability could have prompted
his action.
When the man was brought to the hos
pital his life was at a very low ebb and
he died before Dr. Leonard could rally
him to consciousness. Tne body was re
moved to the Morgue.

UNION LEAGUE CLUB HEARS
REPORTS OF COMMITTEES
Twelve - Story Structure to Cost
$160,000 Is Suggested for
the New Home.
A meeting of the general committee of
the Union League Club in connection
with Its proposed new building was held
in the club rooms yesterday afternoon,
Judge C. H. Garoutte in the chair.
The committee on sites reported that
it had selected the site on the corner of
Stockton street and Union Square avenue.
This would give a frontage of 44 feet on
Stockton street and 70 on Union Square
avenue. The building committee suggest
ed that the proposed building should be
twelve stories, class A, the cost to be
about $100,000.
In the matter of meetins: the cost the
finance committee suggested that $150,000
be raised by subscription,- the balance to
be covered by mortgage. It was then de
cided that a subcommittee approach
some of the prominent members of the
club and party and report to the general
committee, which will assemble at 1:30
o'clock this afternoon.

vestigation made by the authorities tends
to prove thatf the fire started in the base
ment and was caused by defective In
sulation of electric wires. The flames
must have gained great headway and
eaten through the ground floor before be
ing discovered and an alarm turned in.
The inflammable nature of the stock and
the frail building increased the fury and
the firemen who responded to the first
alarm found themselves helpless. It was
not until two additional alarms had been
sounded and the water tower, fed by
streams from six engines, had been placed
on the scene that the blaze was subdued
and pronounced under control. The total
loss will figure about $125,000. This in
cludes damages to the building, which is
the property of Mrs. Jerome A. Hart and
which is insured for $40,000. Studebaker
Bros.' Company Is also well protected by
Insurance.
During the progress of the blaze three
firemen suffered Injury. James B. Miri
lgan, â¢ driver of chemical engine No. 1.
had his right hand bitten by a vicious
horse. A. Bott, residing at 1 Hampton
place, had his .. back sprained by falling
from a ladder. Thomas Cassidy of engine
29, located at Brannan and Eleventh
streets, sustained a serious injury by fall
ing from the tower in the engine-house
while hanging wet hose up on the tower
loft. All three men were treated at the
Centra^ Emergency Hospital by Dr. W.

moved to their homes.
WASHINGTON. July 8.â David F. Wilber

THE recently appointed State
Board of Bank Commissioners met
yesterday afternoon and elected
J. Cal Ewing secretary. The vote
was unanimous. This means that
harmony is restored and that none of the
funds allowed the.board will go to waste.
The commission â¢ has been, deluged for
several days with applications for. the
secretaryship, which is worth $200 a
month.' ' . .
It is known that Ewing expected to pet
an appointment to the commission. Ho
worked hard for the election of Governor
Pardee and has been awaiting a comfort
able berth. When it became known that
he would not be made a member of f He
board it was generally supposed that he
would get the secretaryship. The new
commissioners declared that the secre
tary must devote the whole of his time
to the work, but Ewing has other matters
that demand his attention, so there was
some uncertainty regarding his accept
ance.
It Is asserted by those who ought to
know that the baseball magnate has dis
covered that he can take the Job and In
cidentally the salary attached thereto.
Bank Commissioner Dun3moor said yeB
terday:. "Mr. Ewing has been appointed
secretary on the understanding, so far
as the board. is concerned, that he -wtil
devote "as ; much of^his time' to the work
as is the custom." i'
The board* yesterday issued a a license
for the establishment of the Mission
Bank In this city. The new institution is
capitalized at $200,000, which is fully sub
scribed and half of which is already paid
in. The bank will do a commercial busi
ness exclusively. Its doors will open on
the morning of July 15.

NEWLY APPOINTED - SECRE
TARY. OF THE BOARD OF
BANK COMMISSIONERS.
When the arbitration proceedings be
tween the Carmen's Union and the United
Railroads opened yesterday morning E.
J. Livernash announced that temporarily
he would pass to a new branch of â¢ the
case, "namely, demand four, which Is
that the men are entitled to share with
their employer in his business prosper
ity." Livernash's efforts on these lines
were a failure. Assessor Washington
Dodge, who was first called to help out
in this effort, sought to show how he
had raised the assessment on the cor
poration, and Secretary G. B. Willcutt of
the United Railroads, under the advice
of Attorney Moore, refused to answer
any questions relative to the cost, oper
ating expenses or value of the company's
properties.
When the case opened in the morning
Livernash made the following statement:
Because Mr. Chapman has not produced cer
tain promised statistics bearing on the earn
ings of extra men and the hours of labor of
regular men engaged In platform work for
the United Railroads. I shall temporarily pass
to a new branch of the case for the Carmen's
Union.
It is my design now to offer certain evidence
In support of the fourth reason assigned by the
union for asking an Increase In the wages
of its members In the employ of the United
Railroads. That reason has been set forth
in the union's opening pleading, as follows:
MEN'S DEMANDS.
"IV.â The wealth produced Jointly by the
capital and ability of said corporation and tbe
labor and ability of Its workmen Is so grefct
that the proposed Increase can be made and
yet leave the corporation an undue share of
such Jointly produced wealth.'.'
I desire first to enter upon proofs as to the
amount of capital the corporation has em
barked In the enterprise with which this ar
bitration is concerned, and as the union's first
witness in this connection I now call to the
stand Dr. Washington Dodge, the Assessor
of the city and county of San Francisco.
When Livernash had finished his re
marks Attorney Moore was on his feet
In a moment with the most persistent ob
jections. He said: "This will in no degree
aid the arbitrators in determining the
questions presented for their considera
tion, but will rather tend to confuse the
Issues and add a false element to the de
liberations of the board."
Assessor Dodge was then called. He
testified that Secretary G. B. Willcutt
sent in a statement for 1902 valuing the
property of the Market Street Railway
Company at $863,512. The Assessor, how
ever, had valued the Sutro, Sutter and
San Mateo lines, cash in hand and equip
ment of the United Railroads at $4,000,000,
and added $18,000,000 for the franchises.
Secretary Willcutt was then called to
the stand and was asked a few questions
relative to the United Railroads. He was
on the point of answering the question
about the cost of Iron and wooden poles
when he was instructed by Attorney
Moore not to answer further.
BEFUSES TO ANSWER.
"I don't know your reason for asking
this question, Mr. Livernash," Mr. Moore
said, "but If it is to support your demand
about the men sharing in the profits with
the company I must instruct Mr. Will
cutt not to answer any questions relative
to the subject."
"Yes, we are now on the fourth de
mand of the carmen," replied Livernash,
"and we are not trying to share in the
profits of the company: If we were the
men certainly would earn $4 or $5 a day.
All the carmen want Is a fair day's pay."
"The United Railroads pays and will
always be. willing to pay all Its employes
fair wages," Moore replied. "Whether the
company is making lots of money or is In
the hands of a receiver has nothing to do
with the carmen. We maintain that if
the company were in the hands of a re
ceiver the men are still entitled to and
should earn just the same wages as " If
the company was prosperous. I shall in
struct all the officials of' the-company.to
refuse to furnish any books on any sub
ject bearing on whether the company Is
wealthy or poverty stricken, or bearing 1
upon any question on the value of the
company's property."
NOT ANARCHISTS.
To this Livernash replied: "I'wish to di
rect the attention of the arbitrators to
what Is or what is not a fair day's pay.
This is the subject of arbitration. The
matter is not to be settled by the officials
of the company. The statement that we
wish to share In the profits of the com
pany is misleading. The carmen I repre
sent claim they are not receiving a fair
day's pay for a fair day's work. The
money that they are earning now is prac
tically less than what they earned prior
to the strike, owing to the increased price
In the cost of living. There are no so
cialistic or anarchistic doctrines In what
they are seeking. They do not want the
position of dividend earners; all we want
is testimony to show that the earnings
of the company are much more than they
were." â¢ . .'
Attorney Moore, however, was obdurate
and positively refused to allow Willcutt
to answer questions while Livernash was
working to prove that demand four
of the carmen was reasonable. .
Livernash was. nonplused _for awhile,
and undecided what course to pursue.' He
had many questions which he wanted
placed on the record. He eventually
asked Willcutt all of the questions, and
the latter cast his eyes up at the ceiling
and refused to answer. The old Pacific
Improvement Company scandals' were dug
up and among other, questions which Will
cutt refused to answer was the following:
HUNTINGTON'S METHODS.
"Is It not a fact that the Mission street
line was constructed by Hiintington and
the contract was awarded to the Pacific
Improvement Company: that. the stock
holders of the Pacific Improvement Com
pany owned stock in the Mission street
line and that Huntlngton and his friends
charged exorbitant prices In construction
work and then divided the profits? You
know all about this, don't you; now, Mr.
Willcutt?" ,*
The secretary, however, shook his
head.
"Well what I-want;to show," continued
Livernash, "Is that; the actual value of
the properties of the United Railroads is
not as much as they would like it : to be
represented on Wall street." ,
In . the afternoon '. C. E. ' Grunsky, City
Engineer, was called and read: reports,
which he had 'filed with the Board of
Public Works relative to the! 'costTof
construction of street railways in '. this
city. 'â¢.-Â¦Â¦ ;â¢ ' ': "'Â¦Â¦;/
The resumption of the taking of : testi
mony will be continued at ten this morn
ing. Livernash < expects to .close his side
of the, case about next 'Wednesday, and
the United. Railroad! officials will? then
have its Innings.'- . . . ;.
Secretary Willcutt of Company Or
dered by Its Attorney Not to
Tell About Profits and
Upsets Livernash's Efforts
to Establish Carmen's
Fourth Demand.
For thieves to carry on their, operations
under cover of darkness during the tem
porary ' absence of peace officers is not
regarded as out of the ordinary, but when
several criminals, having in tow. a val
uable buggy, deliberately pass a cordon
of police, in broad daylight, and make
way with their plunder.' It furnishes
something to ponder over. It was due to
the vigilance of two citizens that the car
riage was recovered later in the day.
During: the progress of the fire which
destroyed the building of Studebaker-Bros.
Company at Tenth and Market streets
and its contents early yesterday morn
ing the firemen were able to drag out a
few vehicles to a place of safety before
the flames and smoke caused them to de
sist in their work. Several fancy traps, a
hack or two and four or -five rubber
tired buggies were pulled out of the burn
ing structure and on the sidewalk.
As is usual in all fires, the police re
sponded and roped off the streets to keep
back the curious crowd of onlookers from
hampering the Fire Department In Its
work. Inasmuch as three alarms were
sent in for the fire in question, two score
of officers and several sergeants respond
ed. Notwithstanding the presence of this
array of peace guardians, three thieves
managed to secure possession of one of
the valuable buggies and take the ve
hicle through the lines.
SEE MEN HAULING BUGGY.
About 4:15 a. m. as Proprietor Blodes,
of the Derby Cafe at Market and
Page streets, was returning to his
establishment from the fire, in company
with a friend, they were surprised to see
three men haul a buggy up Market street
and turn Into Brady street. Surmising
that something was wrong. Patrolmen
Mitchell and Slattery were notified.
Brady street, which, according to the
police, has not the best reputation, runs
through to West Mission street. Leading
from it are several blind alleys. The offi
cers arrived on the scene within a few
minutes after the vehicle was seen turn-
Ing Into the thoroughfare, but there was
not a trace of the men or their booty.
Every place where it would be possible
to hide the rig was searched and the pa
trolmen were inclined to believe that they
were the victims of some exponent of
black art, who was able to cause the dis
appearance of most anything, Â¦ from a
needle to a threshing machine. After
searching for some time the buggy was
finally located in a barn on Brady street
and taken to the Mission police station.
Later in the day Luke Reilly. James
Reilly and John Reilly, three young men
who reside In the neighborhood, were tak
en Into custody on suspicion of .having
committed the theft. Their names were en
tered on the detinue book, but upon in
vestigation It was found they were abso
lutely innocent and accordingly were re
leased from custody.
It is understood that several vehicles
were stolen during the progress of the
fire and the police are Investigating. Cap
tain Martin has detailed detectives on the
case and they are now following a clew
which may result in the apprehension of
the thieves who placed the buggy in the
Brady-street barn.
DEFECTIVE . INSULATION.
An examination of the premises occu
pied by Studebaker Bros.' Company dis
closed the fact that but little of the prop
erty escaped the ravages of the flamea.
On the fourth floor heavy wagons remain
and some of them may be repaired and
rendered salable, but most of â¢ the valu
able stock was ruined and will be con
signed to the scrap pile. The- firm, how
ever, will resume business to-day. Of
fices have been secured at 1325 Market
street and orders will be filled from the
warehouses.
Four blackened walls and charred floor
ing tell the story of the conflagration. In-
