LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29.â Two large
warehouses of the California-Vegetable
Union filled with goods were destroyed
by flre of unknown origin before day
light this morning. The warehouses
stood at Alameda street and . Slauson
avenue, at the extreme southeastern
corner of the city, and so remote from
the nearest flre company that, from the
time the flre was discovered there was
no hope of saving them.
Eight refrigerator cars . and one box

also destroyed. The loss will amount
to $25,000; insurance, $16,000.

The conflagration was evidently
started by the attempt of the Indians
to burn their way through the walls
to freedom. The inside of the jail was
a furnace by the time people arrived
at the scene, and the absence of any
noise within told of the awful fate
that had befallen the youths of the
Yainax Indian School.
â¢ An early messenger arrived at Yal
nax, conveying the news of the- tragedy,
and by 9 o'clock this morning a num
ber of Indians had arrived at Bonan

and ordered every business house in
town closed. The people of the com
munity fear that unless the persons
who provided the youths with whisky
are punished to the full extent of the
law, harm of some kind will come to
the town from the infuriated Indians,

The. investigation made by Mr. Bristow discloses a condition of gross
corruption in the office of the First Assistants Postmaster Gener.al and in
that of the. Assistant Attorney General for the Postofflce Department. In
the 'case of the superintendent of free delivery. Machen. the evidence
shows that; his misconduct began Immediately after his appointment in
September, 1893. In the case of the general superintendent of salaries and
allowances. Beavers, It began soon after he was appointed to that place in
lSg'.^n the case of Assistant Attorney General Tyner it has gone on for
anumber of years, but it is impossible to say exactly when It began. A
melancholy feature of the case is that, with one exception, all the offend
ers have been for a number of years In the Government service..
The following ig a list of the fourteen postoffice employes. In the servlca
at the .time this Investigation was begun, who are apparently most seriously
Subsequently, some time in January, Information was. laid before me-,
by Mr. Seckendorff tending to show improper conduct by Beavers, general
superintendent . of the division of salaries and allowances, and Machen,
general superintendent of the free delivery system; and by William Allen
White, tending to show corruption by or under Tyner, assistant attorney
general for the Postoffice Department. First Assistant Postmaster General
Wynne also -informed me that he had become suspicious of the Integrity
of both Machen and Beavers. After full consultation with Mr. Payne it
was decided that Fourth Assistant Postmaster General Bristow should
make a thorough and exhaustive investigation of the charges in question,
and of all matters that might be'developed In connection with them. ilr.
Bristow's report is a record of as thorough a bit of investigating work as
has ever been done under the Government.
After % this investigation had been in progress for about two months it
became evident that legal proceedings would have to be undertaken
against some of the offenders. Owing 'to. the Importance of the case it was
deemed advisable that special counsel should be employed, and Messrs.
Charles J. Bonaparte and Holmes Conrad were chosen for this purpose.
Messrs. Bonaparte and Conrad, 'in their review of the report of Mr. Eri3
tow, speak as follows:
"We consider the report an exceptionally able, candid and Impartial
review of its subject matter and that it shows clearly reprehensible mis
conduct, amounting in many cases to crime, on the part of a number oC
public officials. It is a voluminous document, but this arises not from pro
lixity, but from the nature of the matters discussed. ? â¢';Â¦Â¦â¢ We heartily
commend the report and deem its conclusions fully justified by the facts
it sets forth; .and while regretting in common with all patriotic citizens
that the grave abuses of long standing which it reveals should have grown
up In the Postoffice Department, we consider the exposure of these abuses
and the attempts made .to punish those responsible for them a work of the
highest public utility, quickly and j ably rerf ormed."
In all "that is thus said of the report of Mr. Bristow I cordially agree.
y>-' LONG LIST OF, IMPLICATED OFFICIALS.
It appears that in December, 1902, Postmaster General Payne and Con
gressman E.F. Loud, chairman of the Committee on the Postoffices and
Postroads, held verlous consultations regarding the postal service, and as
a result of these interviews it was determined that as soon a3 possible af
ter the necessary appropriations could be made by the Congress, an in
vestigation should be made of the service, both Messrs. Payne and Loud
agreeing as to the need for the investigation and the time when it should
take place. Accordingly an Increase of $5000 in the appropriation bill re
ported in January was made for the express purpose of carrying on the
investigation In question. The reasons for the increase in the appropria
tion were ' known only to the Postmaster General, to Congressman Loud
and to Congressman Bromwell.

statement, but. told'Inspector, Simmons " verbally* that he had never heard
of it and had Â¦ nbTdirec t on . indirect^ in terest in ; the* company. . For this trans

! District Attorney decided'that^ttieTevldence against Heath was not sufficient.
â¢ Bristow says 'that, .eliminating,- all indications of fraud arid passing on the
case wholly as a 'question . of judgment, > the* transaction would have justified
summary removal .from, office of Heath and Beavers. 8Â®SÂ§9
â¢ The division of supplies and allowances, of which George W. Beavers
was head, and the division of free delivery^of which S. A. W. Machen was
head; were both involved in ' the ..transaction.
A company to manufacture and sell this device was promoted by W. W.
Montague, postmaster in San Francisco, and D. S. .Richardson, cashier in
that office. Not the . least interesting part of the report is the revelation
that Congressman Loud's secretary. H. F. Dodge of San Francisco, received
150 shares of stock in the letter box device company, unknown to the Con
gressman, who was himself Instrumental in bringing about the investiga
tion. ;
Â¦* Bristow tells how, in an effort to interest the department in the Mon
tague indicator, 1000 shares ; of stock' were given to- Machen. who had it
made out in the name of H. 'C. Sega r, 'and 2000 shares to Beavers. Segar
says he paid Machen $1200 for his stock. - There is mystery regarding the
true ownership of. the 2000 shares given to Beavers. It was issued in the
name of D. S. Richardson, and, at Beavers' ; suggestion, assigned to John
R. McDonough.' Bristow shows letters sent by Beavers .to Richardson.
One of them acknowledges the first dividend on the stock and says:
"I have not seen Mr. . Heath,': but iwill make another effort to-day."
'Intense public interest will be taken in the revelations made by Bris
tow regarding the connection of former First Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral Perry S. Heath with some of the most sensational transactions.
Heath has not been connected with the department since July 31, 1900, when
he resigned. He still continues as secretary of the Republican National
Committee. The general impression has been that Heath, was not indicted
because he was protected by the three years statute, of limitations. It
now appears that in' two instances his case' was submitted to a District At
torney for indictment, but the District Attorney decided that the evi
dence was not sufficient to justify, indictment. V Â¦;",.{

The correspondent of tfie Daily Mail

Viceroy of the Far East, has sent the
battleship Bottavla and three torpedo
boat destroyers to Chemulpo to support
Russia's demands for redress in con
nection with the recent affray between
Russian an* Japanese sailors, regard
ing which the Russian Minister at Seoul
maintains an unyielding attitude.

purchase the two battleships Libertad

LONDON. Nov. 30.â According to the
Tokio correspondent of the Daily Mail,
a telegram from Tientsin to the Amlji
reports a sensational conversation be
tween Russian General Wogack and
Yuan Ehai Kai. director general of the
Peking Railway, in which General
"Wogack is reported to have said that
the demand for the evacuation of Man
churia was unreasonable and impossi
ble of fulfillment. Yuan Shi Kai re
plied to this that a third power would
never consent to accept such a view.
General Wogack rejoined that "a third
power" meant Japan, and that Russia
could easily crush so small and poor an
opponent at c-ne blow, adding that
China must accede to Russia's wishes.
Baron Hayashi, the Japanese Minister
to Great Britain, In an interview to-day

sidered it to be in the interest not only
cf Japan, but of other countries, that
cither Yongampho or Wiju be opened to
foreign commerce. Japan, however, he
eaid, would negotiate such a matter
with Korea and not with Russia.
Acquisition by the Russo-Chinese
Bank of a large area of Government
land at Newchwang and the construc

The Russian administration in New

It is reported that the supply of oil
in the Eastern States is steadily declin
ing. The Standard has been making
every effort to encourage the opening
of new fields, and the project of estab
lishing the largest refinery in the world
in the Kern River district is the direct
result of conditions In the East that so
seriously threaten the Standard's sup
ply.
It is known that work on the plans
has already progressed well nigh to the
point of completion, and the company
is even now preparing a site across the
Southern Pacific spur track, in proxim
ity to the great reservoirs recently built
for the colossal new refinery.
There are some urgent reasons that
have impelled the Standard to locate
its largest refinery in the Kern River
field. It is now common knowledge that
while the light oil from the Coalinga
field is readily transmitted -through the
pipe line to Point Richmond, the heav
ier product of the Kern River field is
not moved with equal facility.
In addition to the density of the oil,
which is a bar to rapid movement
through the pipe line, the company has
been having a deal of trouble with
sand, and in the past three weeks an
effort has been made to cleanse the
pipe line by running a distillate through
It. How successful this has been is not
known, but the company evidently
realizes that there will be always more
or less difficulty in transporting the
crude oil through the line.
The pipe line will be supplied with oil
that has been subjected to one or two
processes that will have separated the
heavy asphaltum, and that product will
receive final treatment in the establish
ment at Point Richmond.
BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 29.â The Stan
dard Oil Company is now having plans
drawn for a refinery to be constructed
in the Kern River field and which when
completed will be the largest plant of
its kind in the world.
Sp*dal Dispatch to The Call,
Influential Chinese prevailed on the
Government to send the boat again to
the rescue and she returned with four
Junks and 109 men, and on a* third trip
picked up three junks and five men.
Their appearance told a tale of extreme
hardship and physical suffering. It
was the same taleâ no food, no water.
The Stanley's captain counted as many
as fifty-seven Junks drifting seaward
helpless, all flying distress signals. The
naval authorities dispatched three tor
pedo-boat destroyers and the * naval
water tank, which relived the suffer
ings of many rescued, and the torpedo
boat destroyers picked up several
junks. A Chinese cruiser also aided in
the work.
The fishermen estimate that of the
400 Junks 300 were disabled or sunk and
all tell of many men struggling in the
heavy seas and of the final disappear
ance. Thousands of lives undoubtedly
were lost. The typhoon came upon the
fishing fleet suddenly*. They * had
scarcely time to drop the sails, to haul
in their trawls when the swirling wind
was on them. With a clatter down
came the masts and rigging, littering
the flooded decks and swinging against
the bulwarks of the Junks. Huddled
together in fright the unfortunate Chi
nese waited for death, and hundreds
were swept from the decks. Many of
the Junks were sunk by the heavy seas,
foundering with all on board.
Signals of distress were flown from
what was left of masts or on the high
est point. Death stared all in the face
when the Stanley came to the rescue.
Frantic signals were made and when
the Stanley bore down on the unfor
tunates their joy knew no bounds. The
Stanley was bound on a regular cruise
with provisions for Wagalen light, and
her master, realizing the Impossibility
of relieving all the disabled craft, took
as many as he could in tow and took
off the crews of others. There was a
heavy sea running, but he managed to
get eight vessels in tow and picked up
122 men.
The Hongkong Government tender
Stanley, a Chinese cruiser, three tor
pedo-boats and the naval water tank
at Hongkong went out as a rescue
fleet and saved a number of the unfor
tunate fishermen, the Stanley towing
in more than thirty junks and picking
up nearly 400 men, who were suffering
terribly from thirst and hunger, for
the survivors had. been without;. food Â¦
f&f from" two to five days. Â¦'-'Â¦-' *
When the gale swept down on the
fishing junks the havoc wrought was
fearful. Rudders were swept away,
masts broken, sails ripped and general
destruction was rife. For days the dis
abled junks drifted helplessly about,
the crews suffering the pang# of hun
ger and thirst.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 29.â While
400 Chinese fishing junks were lying
off Swatow on November 8. according
to advices brought by the steamer
Athenian to-day, . a typhoon swept
down upon them, as a result of which
at least 300 of the junks were disabled
or sunk and thousands of lives were
lost.

The San Francisco Call.an increase in the allowance for clerk hire at
Prestonsburg. Ky., the postmaster being his
sister. A count was ordered and the report
showed the office entitled to $250 per annum,
but an allowance of $500 was made, which
afterward, at Langley "s 'request, was In
creased to $700.
In May. 1900. the member of Congress recom
mended an Increase In i the allowance at Con
yers, Ga.. which was Â¦ then $40 a year. A
count was ordered and the report showed the
office entitled to $160 per annum: only $100,
however, was allowed. Afterwards, the Con
gressman called on Beavers personally and
the allowance was increased to $820. This in
crease of $720 was , paid to a clerk recom
mended by the Congressman. On July 1, 1902.
this clerk was transferred to another office and
the allowance was then reduced, to $100 per
annum, plainly indicating that the $720 in
crease In the allowance was made to give a
cleric employment and not because of the needs
of the offloe. Â¦ ' -
At Port Deposit, Md., the postmaster was
receiving an allowance of $60 per annum for
separating purposes. On February 13. 1903.
the member of Congress asked that on account
of increased business the allowance be made
$500, and that Ethel VS. Colvin be designated
as the clerk at that salary. On February 17
he was advised that the Increase had been
authorized. On February 27. the postmaster
having refused to appoint Miss Colvin, the
Congressman wrote, stating that fact and sug
gesting that the allowance be reduced to $60,
which was immediately done.
The foregoing cases refer to clerk hire In
third and fourth class offices. A hundred
other similar cases could be cited.
Offices of First and Second Classes â It. was,
however, in offices of the first and second
classes that Beavers reached bis climax of
reckless and . criminal waste In the matter ot
clerk hire. Clerks were appointed in post
offices when they were not needed. Promo
tions were made without consulting the post
masters. Clerks were placed upon the rosters
of Dostofflces and paid when no service was
rendered. Changes were made In the titles of
clerks or emDloyes In offices In order to In
crease, their salary, while the duties performed
would remain the same.
LEASES
In five first-class offices assistant postmasters
have been designated as cashiers for the sole
purpose of giving them larger salaries than
they were entitled to under the law. Forty
eight clerks at first-class postofflces have been
receiving salaries of from $100 to $400 per
annum In excess of what they were entitled to.
Maurice Hooker was appointed a laborer In
the Dostofflce at Fredonia. N. T.. at $400 per
annum on January 1, 1902, and though he did
no work In the office he drew pay until June
30, 1903, amounting to $600. He employed a
substitute for a part of the time at an ex
pense of $150. â_.._ ,_
At Fredonia. N. T.. on October 11. 1899, the
postmaster was directed to appoint Frank P.
Ball as laborer, at a salary of $600 per annum,
which he did: and Ball was carried on the
rolls at that rate from October 12. 18dS. to De
cember 31, 1902, and paid $2532 07, for which
he rendered no service whatever, being en
gaged most of the time in the ticket brokerage
business at Dunkirk. N. Y. This period covers
a part of the terms of two postmasters: botn
of them, however, certified Ball as regularly
N. T.. John A. Link was ap
pointed a laborer In the postofflce on May 1.
1898, at $600 per annum, and drew pay until
June 30 1903, covering a period of more than
five years. He waa a barber and continued to
work at his trade during all that time. He
received In all S3100 55. less $1*1 pal* for a
substitute, for which he rendered no service.
At Baltimore, i^d.. on January 1. 1898 John
W Pettlt was appointed an auxiliary Clerk at
$200 per annum. He neither performed duty
nor drew pay until July 21, 1898. when his sal
ary was Increased to $600 per annum; and
from that date he drew pay regularly, but per
formed no*Â»ervice whatever. On September 30.
1890, his roster title was changed to "book
keeper" and his salary increased to $1500. This
salary was paid him by the postmaster until
September 9. 1002, although he performed no
services.. , _
The postmaster says he protested to Beavers
against the appointment of Pettit, stating that
he was personally distasteful to him and that
he would not allow him in the office. But at
the same time he certified his name to the
Auditor every quarter during the entire, pe
riod as a clerk rendering service. Pettlt was
paid $5130 96, for which he performed no ser
vice whatever. In these and all similar cases
known the amounts paid have been charged
against the postmasters who made iuch certifi
cation.
The leasing of premises and furnishing of
light and fuel for first, second and third class
postofflces are under the supervision of the sal
ary and allowance division.
Formerly leases were made usually for a
period of five years, with a proviso that the
Government might at any time cancel the
lease. If the Interests' of the postal service re
quired It. by giving three months' notice.
Sometimes It was found necessary to omit the
"three-months" clause" in order to secure tha
most desirable location, but these instances
were rare.
' In 1693 a law was enacted authorizing the
department to make leases for a period not
exceeding ten years. On November 2 following
the enactment of this law the First Assistant
Postmaster General, in a letter Intended as a
guide to Inspectors when investigating lease
cases, stated: -
"While the department has authority to ex
ecute a lease for a period of ten years. It Is not
deemed advisable to do so unless it can ba
demonstrated that a positive advantage to tho
service will be secured thereby." '
This policy, however, was not consistently
carried out.
Canceling leases. â At "Weenawken, N. J., on
July 1. 1900. a lease was executed for ten
years, at $500 per annum. Including all equip
ment, heat, light, etc. On July 1, 1902. eight
years before the lease expired. It was canceled
and a new lease entered Into for the same
premises and the same equipment at an' annual
rental of $800. . '
At Hastings/ Nebr., on May 1. 1897, m. lease
was made for -postof flee premises for a period
of five years, including light, heat, vault and
equipment, at an annual rental of $700 per an
num. In March the lessor was notified that
the lease would be canceled on June 30, almost
a year before its expiration. Shortly after thia
a proposal was accepted for another building
no more desirable, at a rental of $1800 per an
num. A most vigorous protest was filed
acalnst this action of the department by thosa
Interested In the canceled lease-, and the mat
ter was referred to an Inspector for investiga
tion, who, on April 17, 1901, reported as fol

"Viewed from the standpoint usually as
sumed by the Postofflce Department in the
treatment of lease cases, and eliminating all
questions of personal Interest. I am unable to
conceive what possible representations could
have -been made to the department in this case
to result in the entertainment and acceptance
of the proposition of Mr. Dietrich at the price
named ($1800 per annum). . The proposition Is
exorbitant, and the location one that If in com
petition with other propositions offering central
locations at two-thirds the price asked could
not conscientiously be considered."
As a result of this report the price for the
new "site was reduced to $1300 per annum,
with the - proviso that the department should
pay for moving and Installing the equipment
and provide heat and light. The office was
moved Â¦ at an jxpense to the department of
$746. â

ecuted March -1, 1899. at $450 per annum. In
cluding fixtures, with an additional allowance
of $115 for light and fuel, making $565 In all.
On October 15, 1901, a lease was executed for
a room fully equipped and furnished with light

the "three-months' clause" being eliminated
On January 27, 1902. about three months from
the date of execution of this lease. It was can

And on May 14, four months afterward, this
$1500 lease was canceled and another executed
for ten years at $2000 per annum, with the
"three-months' clause" eliminated. No addi

6ub3equent leases that was not included In the
original lease. - Â¦
It will be observed that Instead of uslnsr
this authority given by Congress to make long
time leases to secure better buildings for less
money, it has been used for the benefit of
"grafters" who seek to pillage the public

Increasing Rental Over Amount of Proposalâ
As a rule there is an active Interest in every
community in the location of the Postofflce
and numerous proposals are submitted by the
property owners. After considering the reports
of the Inspectors- and accepting one of the
proposals. Beavers frequently, at the request
of friends. Increased the rentals from $100 to
$500 per annum above that asked In the Dfo
pos&l. The records Indicate that many at
these arbitrary Increases in rent were made
upon the recommendation of members of Con
gress. A list ot over forty cases is submitted
where increases were made in this manner
The arbitrary increase of rentals by deoart

states that he never saw the stock and
did not know that it was In existence.
Heath refused to make a written state

pany directly or indirectly.
Machen alleares that .what he did for
this company was at the earnest solici

never offered Loud any stock, because he
thought such offer would be resented,

The evidence in this case-was submit

District of Columbia, and Beavers,
Machen and Erwin were indicted on Sep

Combination of printersâ It appears from the
correspondence between J. T. Metcalf and J.
Horace McFarland.. that Metcalf was a party
to a combination of the four principal bidders
for the purpose, of raising the price of money
order supplies at the last letting. When the
bldg were opened It was discovered that the
prices of printing were advanced about 30 per
cent.- When knowledge of this combination
was brought to the attention of the Postmas
ter General he refused to approve the awards,
and ordered a new letting. The result was
that the combination went to pieces, and the
department saved $51,124 16 on the contract.
On October 5, 1903, J. T. Metcalf, N. R.
Metcalf and H. C. Hallenbeck were Indicted

IN THE DIVISION
OF FREE DELIVERY
August W. Machen entered the postal ser
vice as a clerk in the Toledo, Ohio, postoffice
and was appointed assistant postmaster in
1687 by Postmaster George E. Lorenz. On
July 31, 1900, Lorenz retired from office.
1893 Machen came to Washington in the hope
of securing some kind of Federal position
under- President Cleveland's second adminis
tration. On. May 6,^1893, he was appointed
assistant superintendent of free delivery, and
on September 16 following he was made su
perintendent. At that time he was a bank
rupt financially, with numerous Judgments re
corded against him. When he left Toledo he
borrowed turns of money, from friends, promis
ing to repay these loans out of the first salary
that he received, which he failed to do. Vari
ous fraudulent representations were made to
secure loans, and uoon one occasion he even
resorted to f orsrexy; *
A simple statement of facts will give the
clearest idea of Machen's methods.
CARRIER'S STRAPS.
On September 10, 1893. four days after
Machen became superintendent Of free delivery,
he wrote the First Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral recommending that leather straps be sub
stituted for twine used by letter carriers in
tying up their mall, stating that to equip the
service would not cost more than $1750 a year.
The recommendation was approved, and Ma
chen ordered several thousand straps from
George I>. Lamb of New Haven, Conn. Up- to
the time of Machen's removal over 1,000.000
btraps had been purchased, at a cost of $137,
217 39, or over $14,000 a' year.
On July 24, 1900. the postmaster at Worces
ter. Mass.. wrote the department asking per
mission to buy carriers' straps from a local
dealer, stating that he could buy them for
about half the price the department was pay-
Ing. Machen refused this request, stating:
"The straps for this year were purchased of,
Mr. George D. Lamb, In accordance with con
tract with this office." -
This bcld statement was made In the face
of the fact that no contract 'bad ever been
made. Machen buying the straps from Lamb
at a price fixed by a verbal agreement be
tween them. . â¢
George D. Lamb is now dead and the busi
ness is conducted by George B. B. Lamb, his
son. who advised the lnspectors*that he knew
nothing of the details of his father's arrange
ment with Machen. butÂ°that a man named. W.
C. Long appeared at his father's office at reg
ular Intervals and collected 2V4 cents for every
strap furnished. During the nine years that
these Ftraps were used Lamb paid Long con
tributions aggregating about $30,000. a part
of which has been traced Into Matchen's hands.
Long, Machen and Stern have been Indicted
by the Federal Grand Jury In the XMstrict of
Columbia for conspiracy to defraud in con
nection with these transactions.
CARRIERS' SATCHELS.,
Carriers' satchels are purchased under four
year contracts.
Beyle Contract â On June 25, 1S94. a oontrjact
waa executed with John Boyle & Co. of New
York for furnishing these satchels, beginning
July 1, 1894. The shoulder strap was a part
of the satchel to be furnished by the con
tractor. On August 18. 1894, Machen \ wrote
the company that straps would be furnished
them by George D. Lamb. During the life
of the contract 20,784 shoulder straps were fur
nished Boyle & Co.. upon which -Long and
Machen receive 2% cents each. ;- '-Â¦
The Boyle contract expired June SO, 1898,
and that year Machen awarded the contract to
Leopold J. Stern of Baltimore, a dealer In
plumbers' supplies. The specifications called
for* a satchel with leather etrap minutely de
scribed the earoe as the contract with. Boyle
& Co Yet Stern was supplied with 55.700
shoulder straps. Lamb continued .to -pay Long
a bonus on the straps, and Stern paid for be
ins relieved from furnishing. them. >-:-
Machen. Stern and Long were indicted on
July 31 1903 by the Federal Grand Jury In
tiw DMrict of Columbia for conspiracy to de

contract with Stern expired, and a_ new - con

shows that the money which was^pald to Lo- :

GROFF FASTENERS,
The Groff fastener Is a patented device for
attaching street letter boxes to. posts. No con
tract was ever executed for these fasteners.
They were bought by Machen direct. . This
method of attaching letter 'boxes was not a
necessity and in many places postmasters, did
not consider it satisfactory. The cost of .the
manufacture of the patent fastener was 25
cents each. For many years the department
pair $1 60, but the price was afterward * re
"ot the $123,651 25 that during eight years
has been paid the Groff â¢ by the department,
Machen and Lorenz have received about $51,-
The Groffs. llachen and Mr. and Mrs. Lorenz
were Indicted by the Federal , Grand ' Jury in
the District of Columbia on June 5. 8 and 22,
1903, for consoiracy to.derraud and the offer
ing and receiving of bribes.
PAINTING OF STREET LETTER BOXES.
In 1897 Machen made a vprbal arrangement
with John T. Cupper of Lockhaven, Pa.,- to
paint -all of the letter boxes in the United
States, allowing htm 25 cents each, on -the
posts, 50 cents each for the letter boxes and $1
for the package boxes; if the work was done
by a local painter Cupper was to furnish the
material and . receive 38 cents ; for ' each â¢ letter
box and 75 cents for each package boxj '
On July 24, 11)00, the postmaster, at} Spring
field, Mass., submitted a proposal from a local
painter to furnish the material and paint the
boxes In that city for 15 cents per letter box
and 25 cents per package box, costing In all
$32 26. I On July 27, three days afterward, 'he
was informed by Machen that John. T.: Cupper,
the contractor." had : been ' Instructed to arrange
Immediately' f>r painting the .boxes. , After
Cupper had completed the work the postmaster
was directed to ray him $100 50, more than
three ' times as much as asked by the local
painter. ."Â¦.- ' Â¦ Â¦' : -.;Â¦Â¦. -â¢ ; -.'''Â¦:.. Y -,.i'- \

result was that the SitW) prize would have been
divided up until the winners would receive lers

to defraud. Asu:ftant Attorney General Tyner
protested eg* trust the act lor. of the Postofflcc
Inspector causing the arrest. And upon Bar
rett's urgent appeal the Attorney General,
over the protest of the District Attorney, di
rected that the cate toe dismissed.
The administrative methods of Tyner and
P^Lrrett are ciearly illustrated in a numbw of
caeee which were passed upon by them.
K G Lewis.â E. G. Lewis of St. Louis. Mo.,
waa" conducting what is known as an "endless
chain" scheme. Barrett ruled that his scheme
was a lottery, but no fraud order was issued,
and as an acknowledgment of Barrett s lÂ«nicnt
treatment Lewis presented him â¢with a gold

A fraud order was issued against Harris,

Prior to Kemrner's appointment as super
intendent of the registry system, manifold
books were not furnished to offices where less
than 2000 pieces of registered mail were
hcndled per annum. Kempner disregarded this
rule and tent these expensive manifold books
to third and fourth class offfes. The books
are made of material requiring careful hand
ling yet they have been sent to hundreds of
ofhees" throuchout the country that are kept
in small country stores and farm houses where
not more than twenty-five pieces of mall ars
reieietered m a yesr.
The. result has been that the cost of manifold
supplies for the fiscal year 1902-3 was $84.
7Â«>4 S5 as against $41,499 24 for the fiscal year
lftOl when supplied by the Public Printer, an
Increase of $43,269 61. After the books .were
cnoe adopted for general use the company ad
vanced the prices; to illustrate:
On October 9. 1002. 25 books were ordered
for Atlanta. Ga.. at a cost of $33, while on
the 15th of November, five weeka later 2o
books exactly the same, were ordered for

During the investigation it was learned that
Kempner had been receiving from Cuba nu
merous packages of cigars without paying duty

STRANGE METHODS
IN THE OFFICE OF
y TYNER "AND BARRETT
On June 1. 1902. Louis Kempner became %u
roxlrite-ndect' of the registry system, and un
der fcls administration books made by the Gen
eral Manifold Company have been used In a
lavish manner. The original proposition wan
to furnish a book containing 500 receipts for
:*2*i cents each. This book, however, was
never used, but in its stead a book con
taining 1000 receipts, which cost $1 10.
It was I^andvoigt's duty to pass upon the
mÂ«T:?? and quality of the supplies furnished
by this company, and the acceptance., there
for-?, of a favor of this character was con
sidered hiyhly improper, and his resignation
was rt-^uested and accepted.
The Saw required the department to pur
chase manifold ' supplies from the Publla
Printer, but the Public Printer could not buy
completed books. Morton succeeded In hav
ing the law changed so as to authorize the
Public Printer <â¢ to buy "completed manifold
fcook*." After this the use of books of the
Ocneral Mioiifold Company was extended bo
u- to include all books used in the registry
service.
In September, 19C1. George L. Morton, rep
resentative of the General Manifold Company
of Franklin. Pa., submitted a proposition to
furnish manifold books made of a patented
duplicating paper for the registry system. W.
H. Landvoijrt was then superintendent of the
system. After Mortc-n submitted this propo
sition, but before any books were ordered, he
I'roposed to secure LanÂ«Jvoigfs eon employment
â¢with the president of the General Manifold
Company. The proposition was accepted by
Lardvoigt, who considered it a great personal
favor.
Inking Pads. â For the fiscal year beginning

For the fiscal year lSSrt<-93 no contract was
awarded for canceling ink, and from March.
1839, until the beginning of the fiscal year
1^12-3. Louis bought canceling ink from the
Ault & Vlhorg Company at 30 cents per pound.
6 cents hipher than the last competitive bid, 10
crr.ts fcijrher than was paid before Louis be
came superintendent, and from 4 to 9 cents
hicher than present cost.
Â¦ Contract for Canceling Ink. â Shortly after
L^uis was placed in charge of postoffice sup
plies the contract for canceling Ink was
awarded to Ault & Wfborg Company of Cin
cinnati. Ohia. at 24 cents per pound. 4 cents
l.igher than other bids. Much of the Ink fur
rtrh<rd by the new contractors was of Inferior
quality, but Instead of being returned to the
o-mpany It was paid for and burned or thrown
cv.-sy on the cttj dump. During the fiscal year
BLOOO itounds of canceling ink were bought

Mty Points for exrerience acquired during the
three month? he had l*Â«>n in charge of the di

For supplying money order forms for four
years from September 4. 1903. the bid of Paul
Herman was $11,94$ less than that of the
Wynkoop-Hallenbeck-Crawford Company. James
T.' Metcalf , superintendent of the money order
system, asked Herman to withdraw his bid bo
that the Hallenbeck Company, where his son
was employed, would get the contract. He as
sured Herman that If he did so he would have
him reinstated In the position he formerly held
with that company. Metcalf knew that such
withdrawal would cost the department about
$43.CO0. For this action of Metcalf s the Post,
matter General summarily removed him from
office. '
E. J. Arnold &^ Co., of St. Louis, Mo., were:
conducting what is known as a "turf Invest
ment" echeme. On' November 25, 1902, â¢ the in-'
epectbrs. having investigated the company, 1
recommended that a fraud order . < be ' issued
against it. In the meantime the company
had* employed Barrett' as Its attorney and paid
him a fee of $5000. And instead of issuing a
fraud order Tyner gave the company a letter
of â¢ commendation. Two days after Tyner
wrote thU letter Barrett received a check of
$1000 as an additional fee. The company failed

Co.- In October. 1902, the inspectors recom
mended a fraud order against this company.
The. company was given a hearing by the As
sistant Attorney General's office and another
investigation by the Inspectors was requested.
In the meantime J. M. Johns, an attorney of
Rockville, Ind., made a proposition to Ryan
that for a fee of $5000 he could help him,
through his friend D. V. Miller of th* Assist
ant Attorney General's office. After some ne
gotiations it was agreed that $4500 would be
paid to Johns by Ryan If he would give him a
"clean bill" before the Postofflce Department.
This Johns agreed to do, and Miller secured a
favorable ruling for Ryan & Co., which' he

Rifling of the Safe.â On April 21. 1903. while
the investigation of the Assistant Attorney
General's office was in progress, Mrs. J. N.-
Tyner, In 'a clandestine manner, admitted Mrs.-
Barrett and Mr. Hamner. a safe expert, Into a.
private room of the Assistant Attorney Gener
al's office, where he unlocked the safe and took
out all of the contents, which Mrs. Tyner car
ried off. What was In the safe no one knows
but the Tyners. Mrs. Tyner stated that she
went to the office and secured the contents of
the safe under the direction of her husband,
which statement he confirmed. Ab a result of
this episode Tyner was summarily' removed
from the office of Assistant Attorney General
and Christlaney resigned.
For elx years .under Tyner's administration
certain favored frauds and lotteries were given
free use of the malls. Barrett's scheme to re
sign and practice before the office, and Tyner's
part In that scheme, as set forth In the body
of this recort. was the climax of official per
fidy more evil In its results and more demor
alizing to the public conscience that outright
embezzlement or open theft.
Tynfr and Barrett were Indicted on October
5 by the grand Jury for the District of Colum-.
bla for conspiracy to defraud.

The Physicians* Institute of Chicago adver
tised a magnetic belt "free." To any one an
swering this advertisement a symptom blank
was sent to be filled out and- returned. In
every case this .. concern -. claimed that the
symptom sheet Showed such a complication of
diseases that the belt alone would render no
service; and' a package of. cpeclal medicine
was forwarded - in connection with the belt,
by express, C. O. D., $3 60.
When an Investigation was ordered the com
pany engaged the>Bervices of Barrett, and paid
him a fee of $5000 to ' represent them before
Tyner. On November 13, 1001, Barrett pre
pared a letter and sent- It.- to Tyner's home
address, inclosing a note "Indicating the kind
of a decision he .would 'like. A few days after
ward the case was disposed of as suggested
by Barrett In this note.

The books of Barrett & Nelms Â«how that
during the first . flity-flve days of their part
nership they received $6600 from these bond
investment concerns. Â¦ ' â¢
"There are only two ways of accomplishing
this: First, to take the matter Into the Fed
eral courts at a likely expense of $25,000; the
second, to Â«mploy Messrs. -Barrett & Nelms, a
newly organized law firm, who stood close to
the Tyner crowd, but if It was to be done this
way he wou'.d have nothing to do with It."
Pulllarn, however, was not so sensitive. He
employed Barrett & Nelma and contracted to
pay them $10C0 as a retainer, and further com
pensation of $000 per annum in monthly In
stallments. *â¢ '"' *â
On the "1st of December, l!>00. Nelms ee
cured the approval of Tyner of a plan which
enabled it to operate Its business according to
the old plan, which Barrett In his opinion had
declared fraudulent. And on January 5 follow
ing Nelms wrote Bowman, secretary of the
company :
"I wish you would state to your board of
directors Just what I stated to you and- Mr.
Bronston when you and he agreed to pay me
$101)0 fee to get General Tyner to eay he would
approve the contracts submitted to him."
The issuing of this opinion of Barrett's
caused a panic among: bond-Investment ? con
cernSi K. G. Pulllam, of the American In
vestment Company, had employed ex-Secretary
Carlisle as attorney to represent him In his
effort* to prevent the issue of a fraud order.
Pulliam In a statement cays , that Mr. Car
lisle ad\-lsed him: v
Southern Mutual: Company â The Southern
Mutual case, of Lexington. Ky., probably
more clearly Illustrates the scheme of Barrett,
Tyner and Nelms than any other. Nelms was
tho attorney for the company. A fraud order
had been Issued against It by Assistant At
torney General Thomas on January 21, 1897,
but afterward revoked by Barrett.
A number of bond-investment companies were
In Washington during the holiday week of 1900,
but they could get no satisfaction out of
Tyner. But on the 31st of December, after 4
o'clock In the afternoon, they met Barrett by
appointment and employed him as their attor
ney. On the next day he presented the matter
to Tynor and had their certificates approved.
Early In the year 1900. Barrett and J. Hen
ning Nelme. an agent lor a bond-Investment
company, made a verbal agreement to enter
into & law partnership January l.^lttOl. Short
ly after this agreement Barretr- announced that
he intended to render a decision as to all bond
inveetment schemes. This opinion was ren
dered on December 5. 1900. and It held all
bond-investment concerns as fraudulent. But
while declaring Â¦ them "Inimical to the postal
laws." Barrett 6ucgested that they be given
an opportunity â
"To make such changes as will eliminate
all objectionable features before further action
U taken by this'department In the direction of
depriving them of the use of the malls."
And the same mail that carried the opinion
with this suggestion to the bond-investment
concerns also carried the announcement that
Barrett had resigned and formed a law part
nership with Nelms. The result was that
many of the concerns Immediately sought^ his
services. In a letter to the secretary of -one
cf them, . written ten days before he retired
from office, Barrett said:
"I believe we can eliminate all the objec
tionable features In the couracts and put them
in such form that they will meet with the ap
proval of the department. Our fee would be
$1000 retainer and $100 a month for twelve
months."
On June 28, four days later, he again wrote:
"Had a long interview with the law clerk
(very satisfactory). He is a nice fellow and a
relative of Tyner's wife His name is Barrett
and he has charge of this matter of ours and
Is conducting the investigation. â¢ â¢ â¢ I ex
pect a suspension order by about Thursday."
This letter was written on Monday, June 2S.
The fraud ordejr was revoked on Wednesday
the 30th. one day earlier than Vlllere expected.
After the fraud orders against these institu
tions were revoked bond-investment schemes
multiplied until there were several "hundred in
the United Statee.
Shortly after Tyner and Barrett were In
stalled in office eight of these bond-investment
companies, against which fraud orders had
been issued by Thomas, formed an organiza
tion and eent representatives to i Washington
for the purpose of having these fraud orders
revoked. G. A. Vlllere â¢ of New Orleans, a
representative of these companies, on June 24
wrote the secretary of his company as follows:
"I have grot the strongest assurance that the
Government is our friend and will do all they
can lor us. Being sure of this I wanted to re
turn home, but Butterworth. Dudley and Tynep
himself tell me that I must stay here; that I
will be needed."
"Taese so-called bond-lnveetment schemes are
more dangerous to society than avowed lot
teries."
When the Louisiana Lottery Company was
broken up by the Federal Government a num
ber of bond-Investment schemes sprang up
over the country embracing' lottery features in
their methods of business.
Assistant Attorney General Thomas declared,
in 1899, that:
was also operating schemes of exactly the
same character, and en July 1, 1S99, Barrett
declared his schemes fraudulent, stating that
the case should be presented to the District
Attorney with a view of his Indictment. Yet a
short time before he had declared Jhe prosecu
tion of Ufiton for exactly the same offense
"-.vas unwarranted."
BOND-INVESTMENT SCHEMES.
Results of Months of Investigation Jtre Made Public and the Accumulated Evidence
Against Each Accused Person Is Succinctly y Reviewed.
Brandt-Dent automatic cashiers were placsd
in different postofflces for the purpos* of teat-
Ing its desirability as a change- making de
vice, and the postmasters were requested to
report on their desirability. At that time
Wlnfleld S. Strawrt of Canton. Ohio. - was the
superintend* nt of agencies, and George F.
filler, also of Canton, was the Washington
agent.
Judge George E. Baldwin of Canton. Ohio,
father-in-law of Miller, th< Washington
agent, was active in hi3 efforts to secure the
introduction cf the machine by the depart
ment. The methods employed to accomplish
this result are clearly set forth by the cor
respondence between Brandt, president of tnÂ»
company, and Strawn and Miller, his agents.
On February 20. lbO9, Miller wrote Brandt,
stating:
â¢I am satisfied that we have the assurance
and friendship of both partiesâ General Hearh
and Mr. Beaversâ and all that is necessary ia
to cultivate that friendship, if not by kind
words, by dollars and cents, and X think, the
latter will be the most positive; however, tha
lines we have out now will result Â¦ in a
change of programme, which means our ulti
mate success."
Six weeks later Strawn wrote Brandt from
New York that Miller had left" that day for
Washington having â¢"succeeded In a plan to
effectively reach Mr. Beavers through a
Brookljn Congressman." -
On April 6. after a conference with Bald
win, his father-tn-law. In Canton. Ohio, Mil
ler wrote Strawn as fellows:
"Mr. Baldwin â¢ â¢ â¢ says to find out if
possible exactly what this man Beavers wants
to insure our success in that department In tha
way of dollars and cents, but not to give it
to him unless forced to> do so: and when we
do' if at all. he desires to bÂ« present in per
son himself and plan the agreement."
On May 1 Strawn wrote Baldwin, statins
that Brandt would like for htm to come to
Washington for consultation. In response to
this Invitation Baldwin came to Washington
and held a conference with the parties Inter
ested and as a result on May 9. 1399. an or
der was given by First Assistant Postmaster
General Heath for 25O machine* at $150 each.
The machines were exactly the same as those
that were selling In the open market for $125.
with the exception of a slight change in the
base After the 250 machines had been dis
posed of additional orders were given until
C27 machines had been purchased. 217 of
which were shipped to postmasters without rÂ»-
at Chicago, on May 31. 1S99.
stated that ho could use but one In hla '<*Â«Â«>.
yet on July 25. lees than two months later, nine
of these machines were sent to him and he was
ordered to pay $150 each for them. The.post
master at Keokuk. la., advised the department
that the machine was not PÂ«^caiÂ»l* and of no
value to hla office. On June 23. 1900, Beavers
"Relative to the automatic cashier in your
office, you are directed to put the same Into
active use. as it is the desiro of the depart
ment to have a uniform system in the matter
of handling cash In the larger POstofflcM.
It is difficult to understand what interest
the department could have la a systematic
method of making change in tha larger offlcea.
Nina of these machines were sent to Balti
more, and only four of them are In use; twenty
were shipped to Boston, of which only two ar*
now In use. the other eighteen being stored in
the basement of the Dostofflce; twenty werÂ»
sent to New York, only one of which Is userl.
the others being an incumbrane*. to t tie office
Of the 627 machines purchased. 1.3 are idle;
many of them have nevpr been taken from tns
cases in which they wera shipped. ThÂ» aggre
gate amount of money paid to the Brandt-IÂ«?nt
Company for these useless cashiers was iJ.t,.i.V
Eliminating from consideration all Indication*
of fraud and passing upon the case wholly as Â»
question of administrative Judgment. It ap
pears to me that this transaction would havÂ»
justified the summary removal from office or
First Assistant Postmaster General Heath and
George W. Beavers.
But the erement of frand cannot t>Â« elimi
nated. Men of ordinary lTrtelllgen** rarely
waste the public revenus in such * manner
without a personal motive. A bribe of $12,500
was paid Congressman Edmund H. Driggs t<>
Bflcure the order for 230 machine*. A part of
thia money has been traced . to the bank ac
count of Beavers. J
Driggs. Beavers and MlTTer hÂ»vÂ« been In

the investigation of this easÂ» Inspec

cating that Ernest E. Baldwin. Assistant
United States District Attorney for the South

the transaction* between this company tndof
ncers of the department. Ho was the attorney
for the company in a suit then pendms in tnÂ«
Southern District of New York and had In his
possession the original $12,500 note.
The lnsoectors were given a written ora*r
by the president and treasurer of the company,
directing the firm of Boothby & Baldwin, of
which Ernest E. Baldwin la a member, to giv*
them access to any papers In th*1r possession
bearing upon the subject. When the Inspector*
presented this order to Baldwin he refused to
recognlie It. became very angry. *"<* wtth Z!Â°:
lent and profane language ordered them from
hl Tnere C % reason to believe that Judge George
B. Baldwin knows as much about this fraud
as any ftther party, not even excepting Beavers
and Driggs. He la at present Consul at Nurem

any time while the lnvestieation wu In proc

that they were useless and an incumDrane* to

the department that they were of no advan
tage to him: that the clerks could do the work
better and faster by hand.
The work done upon these typewriters was et
such an unsatisfactory character that the clerks
in the inspecting division of the auditor s office
protested against their use. Their protest was
transmitted to the First Assistant Postmaster-

JOHN M. MASTEN.
Charles J. Heller of Philadelphia, who fur
nishes badges for rural carriers, receiving BO
cents each, was required to give Machen 10
per ' cent on the gross sales, 'amounting to
$767 C5 in three years.
The. "Heller case" completes the record for
the free-delivery division wherein the inves
tigation has resulted in criminal proceedings.
Many of the frauds that yielded Machen the
largest returns, viz., those relating to pack
age boxes, Groff fasteners, letter boxes, and
straps, began during the administration of
Hon. Wilson S. Bissell as Postmaster General
and Frank H. Jonee aa First Assistant. A
change in the politics of the national admin
istration did- not retard the progress of his
corrupt operations, it -Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦
Machen does not seem to have considered a
day of reckoning as possible. Over nine years
of continued prosperity had given him confi
dence. He had passed safely through two
Congressional investigations, one in 1896, by
the Committee on .the Postdrflce and Post
Roads of the House, and one 'in 1897, by the
Committee on Civil Service and Retrenchment
of the Senate. He had deceived his superior
officers |hrough the administration of four
Postmasters General and a like number of
first assistants. But his schemes finally grew
to be so elaborate and their ramifications so
extensive that the atmosphere became charged
with suspicion. Damaging etorles affecting his
Integrity reached the ears of his superiors,
and this investigation was ordered.
MACHEN'S RAKE-OFF
ON CONTRACT FOR
CARRIERS' BADGES
John W^ Langley. . appointment clerk of the
Census Office,, on December 6, 1900. requested
v The postmaster at Duquoln, 111. .in Decem
ber, ' 1901, asked for an allowance for'clerk
hire. The postmaster was directed to keep ac
count of the transit mall handled which he
failed to do; but submitted a statement show
ing the local work of the office. He was In
formed that - no , clerk hire could be allowed
under the law for local work.' In March, 1902
the member of Congress recommended that an
allowance of â¢ $5C0 per annum be * given that
orCce." and the request ' was ' compiled with
The amount -was afUrward Increased to $900
per /annum.': -Under the . rules of ;Â¦ the depart
ment, on the basis of a count made â¢ in Au
gust. 1003. : the office was entitled under the
law to $60. - *â¢ ' '- j .."-.'â¢
The amount allowed to third and fourth class
offices is ; based upon the number of pieces
of mall handled In transit. This appropriation
averaging over $1,000,000 annually, haÂ« been
distributed by Beavers largely by personal
favor. If a Senator, member of Congress or
any ..prominent politician whom Beavers was
anxlouB to please requested an Increase in the
clerk hire allowed a postmaster. Beavers would
comply, regardless of the merits of the case
To illustrate:
The appropriations for clerk hire are made
under two heads: ."For compensation of clerks
in first : and second class postofflces" and "for
separating mails at third and fourth class
postof flees." :.
In August 1897. George "W. Beaver* was ap
pointed chief of the salary and allowance I di
vision. Beaver's methods have been reckless
and without rule' or regularity. Increases of
allowances : for clerk hire in poetofflces were
made as matters of favor regardless of the
necessities of the service. Promotions were
frequently made without consideration of the
merits of the clerk promoted." . Long-time leases
for postoffice premises were canceled and the
rent increased i upon the recommendation of
prominent political leaders, sometimes ' without
regard to the rental value of the premises.
Sale of Promotions. â Otto F. Weis. a clerk
In the New ,York postofflce and an Intimate
friend of . Beavers, an' officer of the Postofflce
Clerks' Association, according to hla own story
collected from $8000 to $10,000 from the clerks
upon Â¦ the pretense that it was to be used in
securing favorable* legislation.
Many of the clerks in the New Tork and
Jersey City postofflces stated under oath that
they bad contributed "o Wels' legislative fund
under the promise - of promotion. Frank C.
Hay. a clerk in the Jersey City postofflce.
states that Wela told him that this money
was to be. paid to Beavers after deducting the
expenses for collecting. , . "

RECKLESS METHODS
OF BEAVERS IN THE
SALARIES DIVISION
The r , large boxes fastened to the letter .box
posts or Â¦ other supports are styled package
boxes. They were first contracted for In 1893.
Isaac McGlehan was the real contractor at that
tlmÂ« and has been since.
In 1897 Solomon C. Wynn. whose bid for let
ter boxes was thrown out upon the fiction that
Machen had a cousin Interested with him, was
also a bidder on package boxes, and offered to
supply them for $3 50 each. But the bid was
set aside with five others, ranging in price
from $4 to $8 per box, and the contract given
to McGiehan at $10 80. The evidence shows
that McGlehan paid Machen a "royalty" of B0
cents a box. McGlehan and Machen have both
been indicted. <Â»* Â¦Â¦.â¢Â¦Â¦
PACKAGE . BOXES.
Machen and Scheble were Â¦ Indicted by the
Federal Grand -Jury- In the District of Colum
bia, September 8, 1903, for conspiracy and
fraud.â 'â¢ Â¦ Â¦ -Â»â¢â¢;. â¢
One Solomon C. Wyrm submitted a proposal
to furnish the various sized boxes at $1 75.
$2 25 and $2 75, as against the Scheble box at
$2 60. $3 25 and $5 25 each. Wynn. therefore,
became an embarrassing competitor. But
Machen was equal to the occasion. He stated
to Posynaster General "Wilson that he had a
cousin, Arnold J. J. Machen, of Toledo, Ohio,
who was Interested 'with Wynn in this box,
and that he did not think It proper for the
contract to be awarded^ to a firm in which a
relative of the superintendent of free delivery
was financially Interested. The Postmaster
General evidently was Impressed by the unself
ish devotion of Machen to the public Inter
ests, for Wynn' a bid was discarded, though In
so doing the cost of letter boxes during the
contract period was increased $51,553 80. The
profits on thte contract to Maybury & Ellis
aggregated something over $53,000, half of
which was given to Scheble, which the evidence
indicates was divided equally with Machen.
During the past four years 27,000 letter boxes
have been distributed on rural routes. They are
unnecessary, since every farmer's letter box
serves the purpose of both a deposit and a col
lection box. Postmasters wrote ' frequently
stating that the boxes were of no use, that in
many of them there was not a letter deposited
once a month. Nevertheless. Machen continued
to have them erected, and during the last four
years over $70,000 has been paid for letter
boxes on rural routes.
One of the most important contracts for free
delivery supplies Is that for street letter boxes.
These contracts are let periodically,' every four
years, in February, 1893. the contract was
awarded to Maybury & Ellis of Detroit, Mich.
Madhen became superintendent' of free delivery
in the . following September, bIx months after
the contract had been executed.
Maybury states that not many months after
Machen s appointment Eugene D. Scheble a
dentist of Toledo, Ohio, called on him and in
terested him in a patent he had acquired for
a new letter box. Maybury agreed to give
Scheble a 25 per cent interest in the contract
which he then held. Maybury, when asked why
he gave Scheble an interest in this contract,
stated that he thought there was merit in
Scheble's box. and that it might In the ruture
become n, troublesome competitor.-
It Is not reasonable to suppose that a man of
affairs like Maybury, who had at that time
served two terma in Congress and Is at present
Mayor of the city of Detroit, should volun
tarily deliver to a stranger from Toledo, Ohio,
one-fourth of his profits in so valuable a con
tract because he feared that two or three years
hence that man might become a dangerous
competitor for another contract, t
During the first yearâ that Is. before Scheble
had interested ; himself in the contractâ there
were 2740 boxen ordered, for which the- depart
ment paid $8189 40. Maybiiry's profits, 'as near
as can | be . estimated, amounted '.to $3425 on
that year's business. During the. second year,
after Scheble became interested. 16.400 boxes
were ordered, at a cost of $52,526 25. The total
profits of the second year's business was $20.
500, of which 'Maybury received three-fourths,
or $15,375. and Scheble one-fourth, or $5215.
In 1897. when a new contract' was to be
made, the box "which MayUnry had"' acquired
from Scheble, known as the Scheble box. was
the one selected, and, as a result, Maybury &
Ellis were required to give him a B0 per cent
interest in She new contract. The evidence
shows that Scheble remitted one-half of his
profits in this contract to Machen.
STREET LETTER BOXES.
Charles E. Smith Caees â The cases alleged
to be for city delivery were bought of Charles
E. Smith of Baltimore, Md. They were ex
actly the same jib the Runkle cases in con
struction. C. Ellsworth Upton, an employe
under McGregor in the free delivery division,
took up with Smith' the matter of supplying
these cases. Upton submitted to him a sample
case and Smith told him he could furnish them
for 50 or 60 cents . each. Upton told him to
make a proposal to Machen at 90 cents, which
he did; and 20,000 cases were bought from
him at that price. Smith states that the profits
en all the cases he furnished was $11,450, and
that this amount was. divided as follows:
."Ma-chen, $4000; McGregor. $2000; Upton,
$2000; Smith. $3450.
Upton and McGregor were Indicted in Balti
more on June 25, 1003. for conspiracy to de
iraud.
Machen, Runkle and McGregor were Indicted
by the Federal Grand Jury In the District of
Columbia on July 81, 1903, for conspiring to
defraud. .
When the system of carrier registration
was adopted, Machen conceived tha Idea that
the carriers needed a. small case in which to
carry the registration book. He bought these
cases from Maurice Runkle of New York and
Charles E. Smith of Baltimore, Md., without
competitive bids. Those purchased from Kun
kle were safd to be for the rural delivery ser
vice. On October 80, 1902 21,000 had been
ordered, though at that time there .were but
11,000 rural, carriers in the service.-
Runkle was not a leather manufacturer, but
a dealer In clothing. He received from tha
department 90 cents each for the cases and had
them made by leather manufacturers, paying
from 25 to 2S cents each.' The 21,000 cases cost
Runkle $5,831 96, while the Government paid
him $18,908 30, making him a profit of $13,
074 34. Runkle paid Machen $2450 for worth
less mining stock and also gave McGregor, a
clerk In Machen's office, certain sums of
money.
Machen, Cupper and Long were Indicted by
the Federal Grand Jury on July 31, 1003, for
conspiracy tÂ» defraud.
CARRIERS" LEATHER CASES.
Inquiry from about 500 fsee-dellvery offices
shows that the expense of painting letter boxes
for the six years prior tp Machen's agreement
with Cupper was 29% cents each. Since
Machen' s removal the boxes have been painted
In thirty-eight cities, * the average cost per
letter box being 23.7 cents, package boxes 61
cents and posts 9 cents each.
Cupper, when first Interrogated, denied that
he had ever paid anyone a part of the money
he received for painting letter boxes. I.ater,
when he was confronted with drafts which he
had paid to W. C. Long, he admitted that he
had paid him' 10 cents per box on every box
painted, or about $20,000 during the last five
years. Fart of this money has been traced to
Machen.
eS to pay Cupper $811 48 for material which
he had ninety days previously notified the de
partment he could secure fcr $180.
The manufacturers of letter boxes by the
terms of. the contract were required to paint
the boxes at the factory, but,' regardless of
this provision, Cupper was ordered in July,
1000, to paint all the letter boxes at the fac
tory where they I were made, and ha was Â¦ paid

E. W. Grova's signature is on eaco box. zÂ»The total amount that the perpetrators of
these frauds themselves received cannot be
definitely learned, but it will aggregate be
tween $300,000 and $400,000. while tho loss to
the Government, considering the unneceesary
â¢upplies that hare been purchased and the in
ferior quality of those furnished by fraudulent
contractors, cannot be estimated with any
degree of accuracy.
As the gross abuses have been brought to
light they have been promptly corrected by the
proper departmental officers. Contracts where
fraud has been discovered have been annulled.
As a result of the investigation four officers
end employes of thÂ« department have resigned
and thirteen have been removed. Forty T four
Indictments have been found, involving thirty
one perrons, ten of whom have been connected
with the postal service. Attached to this re
port is a list of thosÂ« who have been separated
from the sen-ice by resignation and removal:
also a complete list of the indictments and the
persons involved.
I cannot speak In too high praise of the
Industry and intelligence of the inspectors and
their loyalty to the interests of tho service.-
The success of the investigation Is largely due
to them. They have sought the truth with
eagerness and skill. Xo accounts have been
too intricate for -them to unravel, no labor
too burdensome to undertake. Under the. Im
mediate charge of Chief Inspector TV T llliam E.
Cochran they have worked in perfect accord.
A llFt of those who have been employed on thÂ«
investigation is attached to this report.
The results of the Investigation demon
strate that all traveling agents of the depart
ment â such as assistant superintendent of sal
aries and allowances, of the free delivery ser
vice, the railway mail 6ervice and the regis
try system and inspectors â should be placed
under one organization.
A number of changes should be made In the
organization of the department In order to
provide a more perfect check on thÂ« operations
of various divisions, and some restrictive legis
lation affecting the divisions of salaries and
allowance of rural free delivery, and possibly
others may be necessary. What the service
most needs, however, is honest. Intelligent and
vigorous administration. The corruption dis
closed is not due to lax laws, but to the dis
honesty of those who have been charged with
the reRponslblllty of administering them.
In closing permit me to extress my most sin
cere appreciation of the cordial support I have
received from you during the progress of the
Investigation. The hearty Â» co-operation of
First Aeslstant Postmaster General Wynne,
whose bureau has beeji so largely Involved, and
of Assistant Attorney General Robb, has been
of great value.
Bearers and his associates received lera than
$20. COO from the automatic cashier. Yet the
department expended $74,275 for this wholly
unnec?ssary machine.
Machrn probably did not receive more than
$26,000 from the Groff fastener. Yet the Gov
ernment hus paid approximately $130,000 for
that device, which represents a net loss, sinca
the department continued, by thÂ© terms of the
contract for letter boxes, to pay for the orig
inal fasteners.
The syrtem of organized corruption that has
been disclosed began In 1893 and continued
until stopped by this investigation. The amount
of money secured by the corrupt officials and
their confederates Js email as compared to the
total loss to the Government. To Illustrate:
There is no evidence that Louis received any
compensation from Ault & Wiborg, yet during
the first year of his administration the expendi
tures for canceling ink Increased over $10,000.
It doeÂ» not appear that Kempner received
money from the manifold company, yet the
cost of manifold eupplies Increased more than
$40,000 a year.
Barrett received but JCOOO from Arnold, yet
that company defrauded the people out of over
$3.con.ooo.
More than forty inspectors have em
ployed upon this work, sofcne of them contin
uously every day since the Investigation be
gan. The records of 1000 postofflces have been
examined and the flies of many divisions of the
department, covering a period of from Â«lx to
ten years, scrutinized.
For the purposes of this report, the Investi
gation ordered by you on March 7 has been
completed. In the preparation of cases for
trial where indictments have been found. In
formation may be secured which will necessi
tate further investigation and possibly involve

THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
No crime calls for sterner reprobation than the crime of the corruptionlst
in public life, and of the man who seeks to corrupt him: The bribe-giver and
the bribe-taker are equally guilty. Both alike sin against the primary law of
the state's safety. All questions of difference in party.pollcy sink into insig
nificance when the people of this country are brought"jface lo face with a
question like* this, which lies at the root of honest and decent government. On
this question, and on all others like It, we can afford -to have ho division
among good citizens. In the last resort good laws and good administration
alike must rest upon the broad basis of sound public opinion. A dull' public
conscience, an easy-going acquiescence in corruption, infallibly mean the ruin
of free Institutions. Self-government becomes a farce if the representatives
of the people corrupt others or are themselves corrupted.
Freedom is not the gift which will tarry long in the hands of the dishon
est or of those so foolish' 1 or so incompetent as to tolerate dishonesty In their
public servants. Under our system all power comes from the people' and all
punlsmnent rests ultimately with the people. The toleration of the wrong,
not thÂ« exposure of the wrong, la the real offense.
In pursuance of this policy the individuals above enumerated have been
Indicted. In no case has the indictment been sought save where the officials of
the Government were convinced of the man's guilt, and In every case the Gov
ernment will exhaust every expedient In Its power in the effort to see that
justice is meted out to the offenders. Those in the public service whose duty
It is must ever be vigilant In the detection of wrong-doing, fearless In its ex
posure, relentless in its prosecution; but in the last resort, when everything
which the public official, whether legislator, Judge or executive officer, can
do has been done, It remains for the jury, drawn from the people and repre
senting the people, to do even-handed justice, shielding the innocent but de
clining to be misled by any plea into refraining from punishment of the
guilty.
CONVINCED OP THE A CCTTSED MEN'S GUILT.
All this is being done. The immediate reformation of the service by the
turning out of the offenders is not in itself enough to meet the demands of
Justice. The cases against both those within and. those without the Postofflce
Department who by their acts have brought themselves within the grasp of
the law will be pushed with the utmost vigor. Every effort must be made to
see that both the delinquent official and the outsider who shares his guilt are
punished to the limit of the law. â¢ i
However, the prime need is not new legislation, but the punishment of
those who offend against existing laws. The Postofflce Department Is making
certain changes In the methods of administration, notably in the method of
inspection, by which the service will "be improved and the chance of corrup
tion existing wlthotit discovery be minimized; but the only way to meet the
real evil Is to punish the offenders by removal in any event, and, where pos
sible, by prosecution under the criminal statutes. In any great business,
public or private, wrong-doing.ls certain at times to occur. The way to guard
against It is rigorously to scrutinize the character of those appointed, care
fully to supervise their actions after appointment and, finally, to punish with
relentless severity those who go wrong.
The details of the corruptions are set forth in full in Mr. Bristow's report
and need not be recapitulated by me. As regards Messrs. Beavers and
Machen, the corruption took the form of bribery and blackmail in connection
with the purchase of Government supplies.
In the office of the Assistant Attorney General for the Postofflce Depart
ment under Tyner and Barrett far greater wrong was inflicted upon the
public than could be measured by a pecuniary standard, as in these offices
the corruption of the Government officials took the form of favoring get-rich
quick concerns and similar swindling systems; fh other words, the criminals,
whom it was the sworn duty of these Government officials to prosecute, paid
them for permission to fleece the public unmolested.
I heartily approve of the recommendation of Messrs. Conrad and Bona
parte that the statute of limitations be extended in the case of Government
servants to a period of at least flve years, for the persons who in such posi
tions of trust engage in corrupt practices can ordinarily conceal their guilt
for a longer time than is covered by the present short statute of limitations.
This recommendation has been laid before* the Congress In the report of the
Attorney General, and it is earnestly hoped that it will be acted upon favor
ably. Moreover, our experience shows that outsiders claiming political influ
ence sometimes sell their influence to candidates for office â or, In other
words,' 1 blackmail these candidates. There should be legislation which will
permit of summary dealing with such offenders.
The three chief offenders in the Government service were Tyner, Machen
and Beavers. The friends of Tyner have advanced the theory that in his
case the chief offender was really his nephew by marriage, Barrett, who was
his assistant In the office for a part of the time, and that Tyner's offenses are
due to his falling bodily and mental powers. The facts set forth in Mr. Bris
tow's report do. not tend to substantiate the validity of these excuses for Ty
ner, while they show literally astounding misconduct in Barrett. For Machen
and Beavers no excuse of any kind has been alleged. In the case of Metcalf,
the superintendent of the money order system, the most vigorous protests
were at first made on his behalf by a large number of reputable citizens, and
also by others who were at the time deemed reputable, but who, it has since
been discovered, were profiting by Metcalf's misconduct. One of them has
been Indicted in connection with him.
When these investigations Â«n*ere begun some nine months ago many of
the chief offenders, who have been Indicted or dismissed or both, as above
enumerated, were considered to have excellent reputations. A number of the
most respectable people in the land offered voluntary testimony on behalf of
Mr. Tyner. So highly were Messrs. Beavers and Machen thought of by those
who had been brought into close connection with them that the Congress
actually provided at its last session for raising the salaries of both, the sal
ary in each case being increased $500, to take effect at the beginning of 'the
fiscal year on July 1 last. By that date they were both out of office and the
Department of Justice was taking steps to have them indicted. During
Machen's term of service he was twice investigated by the Congress, once by
a committee of the Senate and once by a committee of the House, but was
cleared on each occasion. Yet at that very period, as has been shown In the
present investigation, he was engaged in the corrupt business for which he
has now been removed and indicted. This is no reflection upon the commit
tees who conducted the Investigation, for so skillfully had Machen concealed
his wrong-doing that it was only revealed after months of laborious and ex
haustive work by trained inspectors.
IN I/EAGUE WITH NOTORIOUS SWINDLERS.
Several of the above have been indicted two, three or flve times each.

CANCELING MACHINES.
There are eight varieties or machines in
vet in the postal service for canceling stamps
end postmarking mail matter. Six of thes?
are leased and two are purchased outright.
The arprrrrtation f or the rent and purchase
nf . anceling machines for the fiscal year 18^6

ot money expended for this purpose during the
tim- of the Beavers administration of the
salary and allowance division of $190,000, or
'over 3<<tÂ» per cent.
The Barr-Fyke. the ColumMa and the Pneu
matic are only used in a very limited manner.
The Amrrlcsn Hey-Dolphin are used extÂ«-n
fivÂ»ly. but there is no evidence of corrupt use
of money in ec-curiiig their introduction into
the service.

of the Barry machine. After Helms employ

partmeot for $200 each, but the offer was de
clined.
The company was reorganized in June, 1S98,
*nd George N. Tyner. a brother of the late
Assistant Attorney General, secured a con

then made to setl the machines to the de

'17 of them in use. and there is evidence that

both Heath ar.d Beavers before they were or
dered.

The administration of Beavers was. If possi
ble, more demoralizing upon the Integrity of
the service than that of Machen.
The evidence against Heath was also sub
mitted to the District Attorney, who decided
that it was not sufficient to warrant his In
dictment.
On October 5, 1903, indictments were found
against GreÂ«>n. Doremus and Beavers for con-
Fpfracy to de'raud.
ThÂ»> Inspectors also called upon Doremus and
asked permission to examine the books of the
company to either verify or disprove the truth
of the statements of Truesiell. Ida E. Crowell
and Lonp. hut they were refused permission to
pee the books. Doremus claimed that they
were not In hia custody; that he had no au
thority over them and could not therefore per
mit them to be examined; that they were in
charge of LÂ«. S. Fish, the bookkeeper. Fish
was subpenaed to produce the books before
the Grand Jury. He answered the eubpena,
but stated that the books of the company had
been burned last winter.
There were 130 Doremus canceling machines
installed by the Postoffice Department from
January l."l!Ki2. to June 1, l!)02. The three
checks referred to aggregate $3230, an amount
exactly equivalent to $25 each on 130 machines.
When the inspectors inquired of Green as to
tlr^e payments to Beavers he refused to make
any statement. He was subpenaed before the
Grand Jury and he still refused to answer any
questions.

the remalnlnsr 161 being practically a net loss.
Six hundred and seventy-one of these ma
chines have been ordered by the department, at
a net cost of $143,475. This Is a repetition of
the story of automatic cashters and Elliott &
Hatch typewriters, except that it Is on a
larcer scale.
In 1901 Tniesdell and Green became es
tranged and Truesdell left the employ of the
Bundy Company, and also sold his interest in
the Doremus canceling; machine. When inter
viewed by the Inspectors Tniesdell stated that
before the second order on June 30. 1000, was
given f<v 100 machines Green told him he had
transfeired to Perry S. Heath. First Assistant
Postmaster General. $20,000 worth of his stock.
In consideration of receiving an order for not
less than ?00 machines. , rjw .
Tniesdell states that he contributed *o(xx>
worth of stock to Green as his share or tne
amount Elven Heath. He also stated that
Doremus transferred 55000 worth of h s stock
In the same manner. Doremus denies any
knowledge of the stock having been elven to
Heath, but states that he did contribute fifty
Bhares. Dar value $5oO0. to Green to be used
tor the best Interests of the company. Doremus
admits that Tniesdell told htm subsequently
that the stock was to be transferred to Heath
in consideration of receiving a large order for
machines. Ida E. Cror.ell. Tniesdell s secre
tary who was a bookkeeper in the employ of
the Doremus Machine Company from October
3, 1800. until Aueust, 1901. confirms many oi
Truesdeirs statements.
Heath refused to make a written statement,
but said verbally to Inspector Simmons that
he never received any stock from the LK>re
mus Canceling Machine Company, or any re
muneration of any kind, directly w Jndlrectlv.
Truesdeil further states that on all machines
pold to the department after the order for 100
of model Ko. 1. the company was required to
pay Beavers $25 on each machine, which Bear
ers stated was to be divided with Heath; that
on the first 100 he did not receive $23 each.
but a lump sum of money, as he remembers
*I,Co. which he personally paid Beavers In New
York. Truesdeil states that he paid Beaver*
mims of $5<i0 upon three other occasions: that
he procured the money by checks on the &e\
enth National Bank of New York cashed at
the Citizens' National Bank, by Ida E. Crow
ell. Ida E. Crowcll and the records of the
Citizens' National Uar.k confirm- Iruesdell s
statement as to the cashing of the checks.
Ida E. Crowell states that the money pro
cured by cashing these checks was charged on
the Ijooks of the company to "commission ac
count." Her statement is corroborated by
William W. Lons of Washington. D. *-â¢ *
bookkeeper who was employed to post the
books of the Doremus Machine Company, who
states that he found cuch entries on the blot

name was given as to whom the money was
paid
Mrs. Crowell end Truesdel! left the employ
of the company in 1901. and since then Green
attended to the business personally, as he did
in the case of the Bundy clocks. He has left
a more definite record of the money paid to
Beavers than was left by Truesdeil.
As has ttoen stated, an account of the com
pany was kept In the Seventh National Bank
of New York. In the same bank Green also
kept an account. On March 14. 1902, Green
drew a check for $500 on the account of the
Doremus Machine Company in the Seventh
National Bank; on March 15 the personal
account of Green in the name bank was cred
ited with the same amount, and on March 18
Beavers deposited to his account In the Nas
sau Trust Company of Brooklyn, N. T.. a
check on the Seventh National Bank of New
York for $500. and on March 19 the personal
account or Green In the Seventh National Bank
of New York was charged with $500.
On May 10. 1902. a check for J1000 was
charged to the account of the Doremus Ma
chine Company In the Seventh National ilank,
and on the same day the personal account of
Green was credited with that sum: four days
later George W. Beavers deposited by letter
from Washington. D. C, with the brokerage
firm of Moore & Schley of New York the per
sonal check of George E. Green for $1000.
On June 24, 1902, the account of the Doremus
Machine Company In the Seventh National
Bank of New York Is charged with a check
for $1";Â». and on the same day the personal ac

with the Identical sum. The next day Beavers

Cor. Powell and Eddy Sts. 1PARIS, Nov. 29.â As a reprisal to
protests from the United States against
outrages in Europe comes the mani
festo of a certain number of Europeans
promient In radical and philanthropic
movements with regard to the United
States.
The manifesto Is published this morn
ing by the International Socialist
Bureau. It calls attention to a rapid
increase in the number of lynchlngs in
Americaâ "In j 1902 there were 103
lynchings in a single State."
"An Investigation made by the Fed
eral Government," continues the,mani
festo, "has revealed a state of affairs
recalling all the horros of slavery.- The
negro works under whip and bludgeon,
and dies, frequently beaten to death!
to prevent him escaping from this mar
tyrdom. He is compelled to work
naked; he is imprisoned and shot. Men,
women and children of the colored race
are massacred, their dwellings are de
stroyed and they are burned alive, with
the encouragement of authorities and
at the instigation of proprietors."
The manifesto protests against "these
abominable . acts , which are Â» committed

EUROPE WANTS
LESS LYNCHING
SALT LAKE, Nov. 29.â A rate cut
ting which may lead to a lively war
between Harrlman and Gould has been
started in Utah and Wyoming. The
trouble Is over coal. Several weeks ago
a conference was held In Denver be
tween representatives of Harriman's
Union Pacific Coal Company- and
Gould's Utah Fuel Company, at which
it was agreed that the price of coal
should be raised. No time was speci
fied, it being understood this should
be settled later. Last week, without
warning, the Union Pacific Coal Com
pany JuAped the price 60 cents a ton.
The Utah Fuel Company, with a strike
on its hands, was loath to follow, but
did so. Two days ago, while Harriman
was in Utah, a representative of the
Commercial Club of Salt Lake waited
on him and persuaded him that the
price was too high. He promptly,
without consulting the Gould repre
sentatives, ordered a 30-cent cut on this
price of coal. This angered the Gould
men because they were given no chance
to reduce at the same time and Har
riman was given a chance to get pub
lic sentiment. After wiring George
Gould the situation, they announced
last night a cut of 25 cents on coal and
25 cents on the freight rate from the
mines. This cut In the freight rates is
considered by the Harriman officials
as a challenge. They have been wiring
Harriman and It is understood they
are anxious to make another cut. Such
a step is momentarily expected. It is
believed here the fteht may % get so
warm that the Ogden gateway may be
closed and the Western Pacific push
ed through with the utmost speed be
tween Salt Lake and San Francisco.

For the Dresent the University of Munich
limits Its admission of women by regular
matriculation to such as possess thÂ« abiturta
of the German gymnasium, and they are ad
mitted to this German high school on the
same conditions as its male students. Lady
students of foreign birth, graduates of col
leges but who do not possess the German
gymnaslal abiturta. are admitted only as
hearers, and with the consent of the faculty
they may pursue a course of study and finally
come up for a degree, but they have not yet
been conceded the same rights that are ac
corded to that class of German female stu
dents having the gymnaslal abiturla.
The Consul General saya the rector
of the university has promised to sec
ond the petition of the United States
Consul General to the Bavarian Min
istry of Cultus that American lady stu
dents possessing diplomas from repu
table American colleges shall be con
ceded the same advantages that have
been conceded by German universities
to graduates of reputable American col
leges and universities.
Under the concessions temporarily
made, Mr. Worman says, a number of
American young ladies, graduates from
American colleges, this term have en
tered on serious work in the University
of Munich.
Continuing, the Consul General says
In several of them women have been per
mitted to attend lectures and have been al
lowed to take their degrees on examination
by and wltn the consent of the faculties con
cerned.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â James H.
Worman, United States Consul Gen
eral at Munich, Germany, has reported
to the State Department that the Uni
versity of Munich has opened !ts doors
to women students. "Heretofore no
women were permitted to matriculate
In the German universities," he says,
adding:
BAR TO WOMEN
IS NOW RAISED
Eventually the woman, evidently in
a aondition of desperation, went to an
apartment on the lower deck, locking
the door, after she had entered. A short
time afterward &n effort was made to
gain access to the room. No response
was had to repeated calls and the door
was opened by force.
The woman was not In the apartment.
Her only means of egress was through
a window, from which it Is presumed
she plunged into the bay. She was not
seen in the throng on the vessel after
she .went to the room.
The captain of the Frisbie stopped the
vessel and boats were lov.ered. A care
ful search was made for nearly a quar
ter of. an hour, but nothing: was found
that might substantiate the suspicion
of the passenger who caused the alarm.
That a woman did leave the boat
somewhere near Red Rock seems from
the available fragments of circumstan
tial evidence to be a fact. On the trip
from San Francisco to that point two
passengers, a man and woman, at
tracted the notice of the other oersona
aboard by auarreling. Harsh word3
were exchanged and several times the
woman fled from the companion, only
to be confronted by him in another part
of the boat. ,
VALLEJO, Nov. 29.â When thÂ«
steamer General Friable, which arrived
from San Francisco to-night, was near
Red Rock in San Pablo Bay in the aft

' NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â To the sur
prise of naval officers here, the navy
supply ship Culgoa, which sailed from
the Brooklyn station "for Colon to-day,
had to take 600 bluejackets, selected
under ruaji orders from Washington,
from the men of the receiving ship
Hancock at the navy yard. Nearly all
of the bluejackets are long-term men.
Ostensibly they are being taken to
Colon, so far as the Navy Department
has given any intimation of its Inten
tions, for transfer to another vessel,
which will carry the men to the China
station. ' Officers at the navy yard ex
press the opinion that the men are like
ly to see more of isthmian than of Chi
nese waters.
COLON, Nov. 29.â The next event of
political importance to the new re
public of Panama will be the ratifica
tion of the canal' treaty and its return
to Washington, which is looked for
ward to with much Interest, as conclu
sively settling Panama's status.
The ratification of the treaty appears
to be considered by the Government as
the final step, so far as Panama is con
cerned, absolutely binding the republic
to the protection of the United States.
After this has been effected, it Is be
lieved, there will remain nothing for
Panama to do except to proceed under

Special Dispatch "to ThÂ« Call.
Commenting upon the document, M.
Clemenceau, in the Aurore, says:
"The present document of the Inter
national Socialistic Bureau will with
out difficulty receive the unanimous
assent of Europe, where African slav
ery has not had any history. In the
United States it will meet with Ies3
success.
"If it protested against the system
atic massacres of Hebrews In Russia
the American republic would give it
its enthusiastic indorsement and the
Russian people and Government would
remain rather cool. Our sensibility be
comes willingly blunted at the spec
tacle of our own faults. It becomes
sharpened again and vibrating at faults
of our neighbor."
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â That the
force impelling the manifesto of the
International Socialist Bureau came
from a well organized and persistent
negro propaganda in the United States
is the strong belief existing in Wash
ington.
Secretary Hay and the officials of the
State Department will not comment
upon the Socialist Bureau's manifesto,
but precedents against serious consid
eration of such documents will be
closely followed. Should the matter
ever reach this Government In a con
crete form it would probably find its
way to the waste basket. The admin
istration holds that these lynchlngs are
purely matters of local administration.
Petitions received by Count Casslnl
have been signed by persons represent
ed as negroes not only in the Southern
but In Northern_ States, many of them
clergymen and teachers. The petitions
never went further -than his desk. It
is supposed that these same petitioners
then directed their efforts toward Eu
rope and interested the International
Socialist Bureau.

PERSONAL MENTION.
No statement could be secured from
Nicolo other than that he had sought
to take his own life. On his person
was found the card of a grocer at
Brooklyn, N. Y., whose first name was
Nicolo, and it is believed he is a rela
tive of the supposed suicide. Nicolo
had about $30 in currency on his per
son.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 29.â A. Nicolo,
apparently an Italian about 45 years
of age, was brought to the Receiving
Hospital this afternoon suffering from
a bullet wound in his left breast. As
sistant'City Physician Hanna removed
the bullet, but at 4:50 o'clock this after
noon Nicolo- expired, after saying he
was alone responsible for his death.
The case, while believed to be one of
suicide, is surrounded with some mys
tery. Nicolo was a passenger on the
overland train which passed through
this city westbound this afternoon and
his ticket showed he had taken passage
from Ogden to San Francisco. At a
small station in Yolo County, four
miles west of Sacramento, he stepped
off the train. In a few minutes a shot
was heard and Nicolo was discovered
lying on the ground wounded.
The weapon from which the bullet
was fired was not found. When spoken
to Nicolo admitted that he had tried to
commit suicide, although assigning no
reason. He was removed to Davis
ville, but it was subsequently decided
to return him to Sacramento for treat
ment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Mrs. Short said: "This outrage upon
my boy should act as a warning. I can
but admire his loyalty, but of course It
is undeserved by. those who would do I a
youth so grievous an injury. I cannot
bear to think .of ..the, Buffering, he: must
have endured with that red-hot * iron
"I am as much to blame as any one.
I knew that there was to be some
thing, but I did not know what It was.
I, am under oath and will not say any
thing. mother discovered the whole
affair and I regret that The Call has
heard of it. If any of the boys. should
suffer expulsion for this, you may de
pend upon it I will go out with them.
They are my friends, and I have taken
an oath and .will say nothing."
Mrs. Short tried to prevail upon
Albert to tell everything, pointing out
to him at the same time that an oath
administered to him, which carried the
concealing of cruel- and revolting in
juries could not be regarded with any
seriousness, but no persuasion of rela
tive or friend could move young Short.
When seen last night Albert, while
not being able to deny that he had un
dergone an ordeal which in his loyalty
to* his schoolmates he tried to make
light of, said:
SCREENS THE CULPRITS^
It was discovered by. Mrs. Short that
the boy had not only suffered the tor
ture of having branded into his flesh
the insignia of the fraternity, but a big
bruise prominent on his back indicated
also that he had been struck with a
club.
Members of the family conferred with
him yesterday, but young Short, while
evidently suffering agony, still refused
to reveal the names of his fellow stu
dents who were responsible for the
scars, which he will carry with him all
his life.
Albert Short, residing at 211 Clipper
street, and attending the Mission High
School, is the victim of an outrageous
act perpetrated by fellow students on
Saturday night.
The facts of the case might never
have been known but for the illness of
Short upon his arrival at his home, at
which time his mother, Mrs. Edward
Short, discovered that her son had been
branded on the abdomen with a red
hot iron.
Albert absolutely refused to tell his
mother how he came to be so shame
fully treated, but subsequent pressure,
the lad's continued illness and the fact
being known to his mother that that
night he was to have been initiated
into one of the several fraternal socie
ties of Mission High School pupils,
caused a rigid investigation, which re
sulted in unraveling some of the mys
tery.
Albert returned to his home at mid
night Saturday and hurriedly retired to
bed. Occupying the same bed with
him was his little nephew, John Lewis.
The last named was startled by Al
bert's severe sickness and called upon
Mrs. Short to come to the sufferer's
aid. While attending to her son Mrs.
Short discovered that he had been
branded. The wounds caused by the
cauterization were badly inflamed.
STUBBORNLY HOLDS SECRET.
Albert- stubbornly refused to relate
the facts. When his mother determined
to send for a doctor he begged her not
to do so, for the injuries, he said, had
been dressed by his companions, who
had remedies at hand. Being pressed
for details, Albert said that he was un
der oath and would, not divulge the
names of those, who were responsible
for his condition. When the subject of
Initiation into the fraternity was men
tioned hd pleaded that he himself was
as much to blame as any one, since he
had consented to stand by what might
occur. He acknowledged that he had
gone through some sort of ceremony
and refused to give further informa
tion.
"As it stands the Jurisdiction of the
school ceases when the pupils have
reached their homes after dismissal. It
is a deplorable affair."
One other boy underwent the initia
tion on Saturday night and some time
ago a youth was badly shocked while
undergoing the rough treatment of a
mock initiation. He had been blind
folded and turned loose upon the street.
His companions watched him walk
headlong into a lamppost, with the re
sult that his head was badly bruised.
The boy's parents took the matter in
hand, and through their application the
boy, who had come to the Mission High
School from the Lowell High School,
was returned to his former school."
"In Berkeley they paint letters of dif
ferent classes on the hillsides and now
children of the public schools are doing
exactly the same, which only proves the
force of example.
WOULD EXPEL THE LAWLESS.
"If the parents of the boy injured
complain to me I shall investigate the
matter immediately. I would sooner
that we dispensed altogether with pu
pils who would be guilty of so great an
outrage. Indeed, I would willingly see
the school cleared of all its pupils if a
lawless element prevails nnd begin over
again.
Joseph O'Connor, principal of the
Mission High School, was amazed to
hear the shocking story. He said:
"I am shocked. That alone describes
my feelings. Such proceedings should
be stopped. I do not believe In young
people being cruel to one another, even
If that should be the price of special
friendship afterward. I think that if
they are intelligent enough to be stu
dents of a High School, they should
certainly know what they owe to one
another In the way of privileges and
rights, and no one should wish to do to
another what he would object to have
done to himself. Â¦
"It is time to strike at the source
from which these abuses spring. At
best the societies, so far as I know, are
merely opportunities for the members
to have fun at the expense of other
people.
"I feel very certain that if these
things could be prevented in the uni
versities and colleges they would soon
die out in the secondary schools.
"They are checking hazing in Gov
ernment academies and I cannot see
why the practice should not be pre
vented in the universities, colleges and
schools all over the country.
SHOCKS SCHOOL PRINCIPAL.
"Surely there ought to be some exam
ple made of those who are guilty of bru
tality which one might expect only
from savages. I am speaking now in
the interest of all students and parents
of youths attending our schools. It is a
miracle that* my boy was 'not mur- ;
dered."
singing deep into his flesh. It is horri
ble. And further, the boy will bear
that awful brand with him to the
grave.
MISSION HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHO WAS VICTIM OF BRUTAL
OUTRAGE INFLICTED UPON HIM BY MEMBERS OF SO-CALLED
COLLEGE FRATERNITY WHILE THEY WERE INITIATING HIM.
Chief of Police O'Neill to-night as
serted that there was a strong probabil
ity that Neidermeier and Vandine
would tell of all their accomplices fn
other crimes In which both men ac
knowledged they had helped.
From the assertions made by Neider
meier and Vandine to-day it is said by
the police that more arrests will be
made.
"Before last May I spent three years
in hold-ups and robberies outside Chi
cago, and if the rewards are forthcom
ing for my mother I will make a clean
breast of everything."
The police have been so appalled by
NeJdermeier's confession that they
hardly give credence to all his asser
tions. It is thought that his anxiety
over his mother's welfare has prompted
him to make himself the author of
crimes he did not commit.
"I stalled the train alone," said Neid
ermeier, "then I entered the baggage
car and threw out three sacks. Barnes
grabbed one of them. I did not get
any, as I was lucky in getting away
with my life. They found Barnes in a
swamp with his throat cut. He had the
razor in the hand that he committed
suicide with.
Operator Dougherty and Ticket Agent
Lathrop, the victims of the robbery in
the Clybourne station hold-up, were
present during Neidermeier's confes
sion, going over with him In detail the
robbery and the shooting of Lathrop.
Neidermeier detailed the Paducah,
Ky., hold-up perfectly, refusing to tell
the names forethe reason that none of
the Illinois Central detectives were
present. He offered to tell Special
Agent O'Keefe the entire story of the
daring robber}', and even show him the
house in Kentucky where he hid after
the robbery.
BANDIT TALKS FRANKLY.
Special Agent W. RIley of the Chi
cago and Northwestern Railroad prom
ised him that Mrs. Neidermeier should
be given the reward of $500 for the ar
rest ana conviction of the Clybourne
station robbers after Neidermeier de
tailed the robbery to them and exon
erated a man named Dolle of St. Louis,
who Is now under indictment-
When Neidermeier went back to his
cell it was with the assurance that his
mother would be bettered J&00 finan
cially, o c
A hold-up and attempted robbery of
a Baltimore and Ohio train at Edge
moor, Ind., four years, ago.
Miner hold-ups and robberies in and
out of Chicago were mentioned by
Neidermeier. In all cases he was care
ful to conceal the names of his asso
ciates in crime, merely giving sufficient
outline of tne crimes to warrant Chief
O'Neill in believing that Neidermeier
was telling the truth.'
THINKS OF HIS MOTHER.
Hold-up and robbery of a Chicago
and Northwestern train Â¦ near Boone,
Iowa, six months ago.
A few of the additional crimes he
claims to have participated in are as
follows:
Robbery of the Illinois Central ex
press at Paducah, Ky., in which
Barnes, one of the robbers, cut his
throat Â¦while surrounded in a swamp.
The others escaped.
Hold-up of a stage coach and a faro
bank in Nevada two years ago and rob
bery of the mails. No one was shot and
the robbers escaped without recogni
tion.
CHICAGO. Nov. 29.â Peter Neider
meier. onrÂ» of the members of the quar
tet of young bandits who for the last
Eix months have terrorized Chicago, in
another confession to-day added sev
eral more crimes to the long list al
ready charged against him and his
companions, Vandine, Marr and Roeskl.
With parental love uppermost in his
mind, Noidermck-r offered to tell Chief
of Police O'Neill of a score of train
hold-ups, burglaries and other crimes
that he has committed if the rewards
offered will onJy be sivon to his mother.
â¢I want to know that my mother will
be cared for after I am hanged," savi
the 21 -year-old boy, who is now the
self-conferspd murderer of five men. "I
am guilty of crime of which you know
nothing and for which innocent men are
now suffering. There are rewards of
fered for my capture and conviction. If
you will guarantee that these rewards
will go to my mother I will convict my
self. I will confess crimes that will
startle you."
In order to make good his word Neid
ermeier told of a few crimes which he
claimed to have committed. He out
lined them in such a manner. Chief
O'Neill declared to-night, as only one
concerned in them could do. Neider
meier refused, however, to divulge the
names of his partners in the crimes
referred to pending proof that his
mother would get the rewards.

DIES DECLARING
IT WAS SUICIDE
The audience at the Orpheum last
evening was exceedingly large and ap
preciative.* There were several new
numbers of merit, and the hold-overs
went well. Agnes Mahr, on the pro
gramme as the "American Tommy At
kins," was well received, and her toe
dancing was exceptionally good. Clarice
Vance won her audience from the first,
and all of her vocal selections were of
the best. Hal Godfrey and his com
pany presented ,a one-act playlet, "A
Bad Boy," which took well and was
acted by artists. The character worlf Is
clean-cut and distinct and the plot is
original. Joseph Newman, the Denver
song writer, gives a number of his own
comic selections and tells funny stories.
He made a good impression. Annie Ab
bott, the little Georgia magnet, is the
most interesting of the hold-over acts.
She continues to mystify, and at the
end of each trick leaves the audience
guessing. Searl and Violet Allen are
clever dancers, and their comedy turn
continues to please. Bryant and Saville
still do their musical act, and the Ar
menls-Tito Quariet opens another
week. The motion pictures are new,
and one of them, showing a chase and
capture of English poachers, is the best
that has been shown since the escape
and capture of a burglar was thrown
on the canvas.

Those who recognized Mr. Brophy
were astounded by the coldness of the
j greeting he received from the gallery.
Instead of getting the " 'Rah for
Brophy!" and the wild acclaim of an
I admiring throng, the once popular
| actor was almost ignored. One small
j voice in the upper tier squeaked, "Sit
down, Brophy," and a gentleman in the
; balcony audibly asked his young
1 woman companion, "Who is that swell
# duck." Her answer was a headshake.
# Mr. Brophy did not sit out the play.
"Over Niagara Falls" did not afford
much original food for criticism. Its
story is ingeniously improbable, i^s
characters are .familiar to stageland
and its spectacular effects alone are
worth the money charged for the privi
lege of witnessing it.
The company arrived late from the
south yesterday and the performance
was going on before some of the
scenery and properties were received
at the stage door, which facts condoned
in some degree the tardiness in raising
the first curtain and the tedious wait
which preceded the stellar scene of the
.seriesâ the heroine careening over
Niagara Falls in a barrel. When that
scene was finally presented, however,
the gallery rewarded it with half a
dozen recalls.'
Mr. Brophy, by the way, was among
those present yesterday afternoon. He
entered the Darv.ette while the over
ture was in progress, and he was the
cynosure of all eyes as he stalked with
stately tread down a center aisle and
took a seat near the front. At the con
clusion of the orchestral effort he arose,
walked down to the orchestra, tapped
the leader upon the shoulder, effusively
grasped and shook his hand and held
an animated conversation with him.
Then he gave the bowman's digits an
other fierce clutch and returned to his
seat.
Most conventionally melodramatic is
"Over Niagara Falls," that began a
week's engagement yesterday at the
i Grand Opera-house. It has all. the tra
! diticmal features of the class of stage
i entertainment that made the welkin
i of the big theater ring in years agone,
j when the late Walter Morosco was at
the managerial helm and "Jim" Brophy
! held a warm spot in the esteem of the
1 clientele.

As the market value of the walnuts U
about 11 cents, the product from tho
one tree would net if 3old about $22.
About fifty trees can be planted to thÂ«

would amount to about $1100 per acre."

the people of the counties have been brought
closer together, understand each other better,
view the section more broadly and are more
charitably disposed toward each other. Thesa

The mere fact that there has beÂ«n achieved
this unity among the counties is In itself
wholly compensating for all that has been don*
to this time. The valley and foothill sections
constitute a vast territory of common interests,

Accordingly, leading interests put
aside all feelings of Jealousy and an
tagonism and patriotically came, to
gether in a discussion of the conditions,
and with an earnest desire to do what
they mizht to remedy the evils that
were at that time consuming growers.
As a result of this . conference this
Would these happy and prosperous
fruit growers go back to wheat, and
sheep?
The remaining 60 per cent was han
dled by what were known as independ
ent shippers, including such firms as
the Earl Fruit Company, the Fay Fruit
Company, the Ruddock Trench Com
pany, A. Gregory, the Spruance Fruit
Company, Moulton Â«& Green, A. G.
Stearns, the West American Fruit
Company, the Redlands Orange Grow
ers' Association, the Redlands Eclipse
Association and F. B. Devlne.
All of these Independent shippers
were antagonistic not only to each
other, but also to the Southern Cali
fornia Fruit Exchange, thus creating a
great deal of vicious competition, the
result being that California fruits not
only had to fight foreign importations,
but under the system of marketing,
they actually fought themselves to a
far greater degree. The result, as this
agency believes, could only be disas
trous to the fruit grower.
Last February it became apparent to
those best informed in the business that
unless something was done to put a
stop to the unhealthy condition then
prevailing as regards competitive mat
ters certain ruin for the grower was an
inevitable conclusic-n.
Previous to the formation of the Cali
fornia Fruit Agency, the citrus fruits of
California were marketed by a multi
tude of shipping Interests, the largest
being, of course, the Southern Califor
nia Fruit Exchange, which was a
purely co-operative movement, they
controlling at the time this agency was
formed about 40 per cent of the entire
output.
A dealer in the East would telegraph
one shipper- that another was quoting
The vital difference between our or
ganization â¢Â¦ and others is that we now
have secured practically a solid front
to compete with foreign and other do
mestic â¢ shipments, whereas before the
organization of the agency we were
fighting ourselves and every one else
also. As an Illustration. of the condi
tions existing prior to the formation of
this agency, will say that on the first
day of "April, we came into possession
of the 'correspondence that had been
carried on between our various pres
ent members and the Eastern trade,
and It was simply appalling to note
what we had to contend with.
At the time of the formation of this
agency on April 1st, the present year,
we took over fruit that was in transit
and fruit that was on track at various
Eastern markets, but yet unsold, and
as a proof of the wisdom of the move
ment I will say that when this agency
began business we were Immediately
charged , with the disposition of some
thing like 1500 car loads of fruit in
transit unsold, not to mention the fact
that practically all of the Eastern mar
kets were then glutted. In other words,
this agency inherited infinitely worse
conditions than had ever been known
before in the history of the business.
We were charged with meeting not
only the conditions as mentioned, but
also with the organization of a system
to handle the business, without having
previously had an opportunity to pre
pare ourselves to meet the great emer
gency. In addition to the difficulties
mentioned above, we were instantly
confronted with the fact that specula
tors all over the United States had
tremendous quantities of apples in cold
storage which they had been holding
up to escape great losses.
About the first of April their case
became hopeless and they were obliged
therefore to dump tremendous quanti
ties of that fruit on the. markets re
gardless of what It brought. This of
itself was sufficient to demoralize the
fruit markets. Another serious diffi
culty we had to confront which I shall
mention as another reason for our ex
istence is the fact that an unusual
quantity of our fruit had been held by
the growers for a late market, the
result, of this being that, between the
1st of April and the 1st of July, we
were forced to place on the markets
double the amount of fruit that had
ever previously Â»been shipped out of
California during the same period. In
further justification of the movement
one of our principal members made the
following statement:
"After carefully estimating what
would have been the results to our
growers had the agency not been form
ed,'we have come to the conclusion that
our growers have received at least
$100,000 more money than 'they would
have received had the organization net
been accomplished." This shipper sup
plies about 10 per cent of our holdings.

OPENING CONDITIONS.
BY G. W. FELTS, SECRETARY CALIFORNIA FRUIT AGENCY.
President State Board of Trade.
In 1S59 Horace Greeley made a jour
ney to California, and on his return
published a volume entitled "Overland
Journey From New York to San Fran
cisco." One of his published letters was
written August 27, 1S59, at San Jose. In
that letter, after stating what he had
seen of the wonderful productiveness
of our soil and climate in his travels
about the State, he said: "Fruit, how
ever, is destined to be the ultimate
glory of California. Nowhere on the
earth is it produced so readily or so
bountifully. Such pears, peaches, apri
cots, nectarines, etc., as load the trees
of this valley, and of nearly every val
ley in the State which has had . the
chance to produce them, would stagger
the faith of nine-tenths of my readers."
I doubt if there ever arose evÂ»n in the
prophetic vision of Mr. Greeley the in
spiring picture of orchards, gardens
and vineyards which is presented to
day in the valleys and on the hillsides
from San Diego to Shasta. It took the
people of the State twenty years to
comprehend something of the signific
ance of Mr. Greeley's prophecy, and it
is but now beginning to be fully real
ized.
GROWTH OF INDUSTRY.
Fruit-growing in California did not
assume importance until shipments by
rail became practicable. This was about
the year 1880. The growing of wine
grapes and table grapes to some extent
had made considerable advancement,
but other fruits had attracted little at
tention, and tha't In but few localities.
Production, except as to wines, had not
far overreached home consumption. Ac
curate statistics are wanting prior to
1S90 of shipments out of the State.
Since the latter date and including
1E90 they have been gathered from of
ficial sources and are found in the an
nual reports made to the California
State Board of Trade. In 1880, omitting
fractions, we shipped out of the State
as near as I can learn thirty-three car
loads of ten tons each of raisins, 157
carloads of fresh fruits, twenty car
loads of dried fruits and 335 carloads of
canned fruits, making a total of 545
carloads.
Shipments of oranges were made in
no considerable quantity, but as show
ing progress in that culture Riverside
In 1886 took first premium for the best
collection, not less than twenty varie
ties, at the New Orleans World's Fair.
Note now the shipments. In carloads of

RICH FREIGHTS BY RAIL.
For many years the Central Pacific
Railway sent empty trains of cars East
to bring articles of consumption to Cal
ifornia for which we had little to send
back In exchange. Fruit growing
turned the scale and this fact in part
i made lower rates of freight possible.
Not all this tonnage went by rail,
but most of it did and it has become
a large factor in railroad dividends.
Stated exactly, 70.3S4 carloads of ten
tons each of the products in the fore
going table went out of the State by
rail in 1902 and 7154 carloads by sea.
Few of our people have stopped to
think what a vast product this is and
what an amount of traffic it gives to
our overland railways and Eastern
connections and its Influence on rates
for ' all transcontinental traffic. In
tons it is greater than the entire
wheat crop of the State for the crop
year 1900-1901 and not much below the
crop of 1901-1902.
It required ninety-six cars.^with
twenty tons each, moving out o*f the
State every day in the year, to carry
this exported product of our orchards,
vineyards and gardens for 1902. Will
some one figure what this means to the
transcontinental railroads and connec
tions? Would $18,000,000 be far from
the truth?
ORCHARD DISTRIBUTION.
It is interesting to know where in the
State lies this source of her wealth and
what part of the State is enriched by
it. The annual reports made to the
State Board of Trade have for obvious
reasons stated separately the shipments
from Southern California, south of the
Tehachapi Mountains and Northern
and Central California, lying north of
the Tehachapi Mountains.,
The facts can be no more graphically
given than by the subjoined table. The
products are classified as far as the
railroad companies have reported them,
thus showing the kinds and quantities
produced in each region. The official
reports from which I quote show the
terminal points of shipment, but I
omit these from the table for brevity.
They are In the north and central part
of the Stateâ San Francisco, Oakland,
San Jose, Fresno, Stockton, Sacramen
to and Marysville. In the south are
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino and San ' Diego. These
points are the terminals for the fruit
regions around them.

BY N. P. CHIPMAN, PRESIDENT STATE BOARD OF TRADE.
Most of the almonds are from the
north and about all of the walnuts
from the south. .The reader may make
his own deductions from this table. In
connection with the first table, it tells
an interesting story. If The Call per
sists in its contribution of a page, once
a week, to California industriesâ a
most timely and important step toward
advertising our resouccesâ I will later
on tell your readers what relation our
climate bears to the distinctive fea
tures of fruit-growing here, including
olives and figs and some other fruits
not mentioned in the table, and will
demonstrate that, from an economic
standpoint and from the readings of
the thermometer, th'ere is no substan
tial difference in the climate of Califor
nia, from end to end, except as we
reach the higher altitudes of the moun
tains.
I cannot in a single article cover all
the questions relating to fruit-growing
In California which naturally arise in
the homeseeker's mind. For example,
he will ask, "Does fruit-growing pay?"
Are we over-producing? How are we
to best market : our fruits? The
story is a long, one and none of it
is fiction, and is Just now interesting
many thousands of people. But \t must
come in chapters. Let this answer for
the first.
COMPARATIVE VALUES.
The importance of an industry is de
termined largely by its wealth-produc
ing capacity and its profit to the people
engaged in it. The first consideration
is to supply home consumption; sec
ond, to produce a surplus for sale or ex
change for articles of consumption not
produced at home; third, to put in
bank as snug a sum as possible to be
used in broadening and ennobling our
farm life.
The farm value for 1902 of the prod
ucts mentioned in the table, exclusive
of the Income from home consumption,
was about $35,000,000' This is $7,000,000
greater than the farm value of all the
exported wheat, barley and wool and
the farm value of all the hops and
sugar beets grown in the State.
lean remember when the fruit'grow
ers, In the. Ws, began to expand their
plantings, the wheat farmer looked
upon ' the industry as a . "piddling"
business. . The wheat grower regarded
the orchardist ' with a sort of com
placent pity and contempt. And yet a
little reflection Â¦ ought to have shown
these self-satisfied farmers of immense
wheat ranches that, as State builders,
they were - a' clog _and hindrance,, and
that a large population, would never be
attracted . to \ California ; to grow wheat
i alonÂ», which, with equal profit," could
be produced in many. other' States
where' land was cheaper.
It was obvious to observing' and
thoughtful ' people here Â¦ that the
economic value of our climate and soil,
maklng intensive * farming of high
priced products possible, would " be
thrown away if we persisted in wheat I
growing to the- exclusion of a higher
and more valuable- culture. -And so
fruit planting and cits concomitant, ir
rigation, went on and have made Cali
fornia' famous throughout ; the civilized
globe. Look at' the wheat : and, sheep
abandoned lands around Riverside and
other-places south;, at Fresno,. Santa
Calar, Vaca\<lle and other, places north.
Comprehensive Review of the Growth of
the State's Greatest Industry.
Benefits That Co-operation Has Brought
to the Growers of Oranges.
SCENES IN SOME OF THE ORCHARDS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT YIELD HEAVY FRUITAGE.
In a general way I may say that the
proper distribution of the shipments
and apportionment to the various mar
kets Is of the first importance.- Then
the auestion of the law of supply and
demand will materially affect results.
The indications at this writing are that
the fruit will be of exceptionally fine
quality, and if It shows good carrying
and keeping qualities, the difficulty of
our task will be greatly decreased.
In conclusion, permit me to say that
particularly In this movement the
measure of success Is the measure of
control. "We are directly and entirely
the agents of the grower. With his
unanimous support we cannot fall to
immensely improve his condition.
In the organization of the agency,
shipping Interests which have been in
business since the very beginning of
the production of citrus fruit In this
state, patriotically met the conditions
confronting us and sacrificed their
standing In the business world to the
extent of literally going out of busi
ness, merging and hiding themselves inl
this agency, and that too on a basis of
less profit than ttiey have been accus
tomed to enjoy, and with the posltlra;
knowledge that they were sacrificing
without reward their reputation In tha
business world that is always a valua
ble asset to any successful concern.
The probable output for the present
season has been variously estimated
from 2T.00O to 20,000 carloads, arid it Is
estimated that this agency will be
charged with the distribution and dis
posal of something like 23,000 cars. I
will say, without fear of contradiction,
that with the large percentage of tha
output now in our control, there Is no
question that we will be able to
give infinitely better results to the
grower than could possibly be obtained
wiihout such an organization as ours.
The net returns to the grower will
depend very largely on conditions that
cannot at this time be anticipated.
Weather conditions, trading and finan
cial conditions, importations from for
eign countries, the supply from Florida
and the islands, and a multitude of
other conditions too numerous to men
tion, will directly or indirectly affect
the prices we will be able to obtain.
As indicated before, at the time of
the formation of this agency about 60
per cent of the fruit was scattered
among a multitude of various shippers,
the majority of which was under no
contract whatever. Since that time
enough of this 60 per cent has been
placed under a term contract to give
this agency the control of something
like 90 per cent of the entire shipments.
During the season ending October 31,
1903, there were shipped 22,425 cars oC
citrus fruit. This you will understand
was shipped by all parties In the busi
ness during the year, between 10.000
and 11,000 carloads of which was mar
keted prior to the formation of the
agency.
fruit at a certain price, and be would
perhaps at the same moment wire still
another shipper entirely a different
statement, the result being that unnec
essary and ruinous price-cuttings pre
vailed as a result of one man making
different statements to different par
ties, and that, too,' when the market
and other conditions did not warrant
any such procedure.
"We confine our operations exclusive
ly to the handling of citrus fruits, and
the State of California is our field. A
careful estimate at this writing Indi
cates that this agency will control
about 90 per cent of all citrus fruit
shipments from California the present
season.
Some recent pictures representing
'Â¦rchards in California are published
this morning, the leading topje of In

Additional signed articles that deal

a!so bases for intelligent exploitation

quarters.
All the space available is devoted
this morning to allusion to current
events that have a bearing onfthe
general march of State advancement.
The papers of the interior are relied

tion-
Not less Interesting Is Mr. Felts, who,
by, the way, is credited in Southern
California with having originated the
idea of the present large combination
for the shipment of oranges when he
deals with the extent of the orange
shipments. "The probable output for
the present season," he writes, "has
been variously estimated at 27,000 to
20,000 cars, and it is estimated that this
agency â¢will be charged with the dis
tribution and disposal of something
like 25.000 cars.
"I will say, without fear of contra
diction, that there is no question that,
with the large percentage of the output
now in our control, we will be able to
give infinitely better results to the
growers than could possibly be obtain
ed without such an organization as
oure."

<->f less profit than they have been ac
customed to enjoy and with the posi
tive knowledge that they were sacrific

Mr. Felts also asserts interestingly
that there were private agencies in
Southern California that were engaged
in handling the orange crop of Califor
nia, before the California Fruit Agency
was formed, that "patriotically met the
conditions confronting them and sacri
ficed their standing in the business
world, merging and hiding themselves

Secretary Felts contributes a signed
article that is timely, for it tells of the
marketing of California citrus fruits in
the East and of the co operative move
ment in Southern California that has
resulted in giving to the orange grow

MARKETING OF ORANGES.
Ger.eral X . P. Chipman, president of
the California State Board of Trade.
and G. W. Felts, secretary of the Cali
fornia Fruit Agency, which markets
the citrus fruits of California very
largely, to-day tell stories of interest to
ail dwellers in California and to all
Â¦who may be interested in this State.
Their signed articles .appear on this
page this morning:. (General Chipman
deals with the marvelous growth of the
chipments of fruit out from this State.
Secretary FeJts describes the work o*
the California Fruit Agency.
While this information is of value in
promoting the welfare of California, the
object lessons being th* more striking
from the facts that they are strictly
based upon commercial conditions and
that they emanate from men whose op
portunities for observation are of the
best, it is fascinating to Californians.
General Chipman tells of the increase
in shipments of f: jit out of California
from 550 carloads in 1SS0 to 77,538 car
loads in 1P02. To move the fruit that
vent out of Califo)**iia in 1902 required
an average of 96 cars, with twenty
tons each, passing out of the State
every day in the year. This imposing
array of idling stock was needed to
carry the exported product of orchards,
vineyards and gardens for 1902.
General Chipman asks: "Will some
one figure out what this means to the
transcontinental railroads and connec
tions? Would JIS.OOO.OOO be far from
the truth?" - -
Again General Chipman says, calling
attention to the greatness of the fruit
shipments comparatively and their val
ues: "The farm value 'for 1902 of the
products mentioned in the table" â
(these being deciduous fresh fruits, cit
rus fruits, dried fruits, raisins, nuts,
canned fruits, wine, brandy and vege
tables) â 'â¢exclusive of the home con
sumption was about ?C5,000,000. This is
J7.000.000 greater than the farm value
of nil exported wheat, barley and wool
and the farm value of all the hops and
pupar *beets grown in the State."

many abnormal experiences. Through
poverty or the pressure of unusual re
sponsibilities or the accidents of soli
tude or preoccupation multitudes grow
out of that divine period of impulse
and instinct into another of reflection
and calculation before they fall in love.
To them marriage becomes a question!
They have readhed that unhappy stage
where this heaven appointed relation
ship becomes a matter not of necessity
but of choice. Xothing Is more pitiful
than Its cold and impartial discussion.
The dilemma "to marry or not to mar
ry" is a tragedy like that other one,
"to be or not to be," for marriage la as
much a duty and a privilege as life
Itself.
What do we avoid by staying single?
L The risk of drawirig a blank or
catching a tartar! Certainly, if mar
riage is not a complete lottery, it is in
many senses a game of chance. Noth
ing is more certain than that the real,
vital* essential principles of character
are a post-marital discovery. Enor
mous risks are taken. But this is true
of the acquirement of any great good
in life. People who do not take the
hazard of -a noble chance may gain
trifles, but not immensities.

"The annual diamond smashing bee
is due to open Christmas afternoon,"
remarked the gem expert of a big Jew
elry store. "Somehow diamonds breed
suspicion. Many of them are bought
for Christmas gifts, and you would be
surprised to learn how many good,
some of them fine stones are broken
under a hammer because the recipient
of the present suspected that the
sparkler was not a genuine diamond.

"The week following Christmas is my
week for listening to hard luck stories
from young men whose sweethearts
pulverized the diamonds Santa Claus
gave them. It also is the week of all
weeks in the year when I am called
upon to pass judgment on garnets,
cat's-eyes, carbuncles, emeralds, pearls,
sapphires, tourmalines. rhinestones,
quartz and cut glass and cave crystals.
"I am called upon, however, more fre

There was a time when we sold only
diamonds, rubies, pearls, emeralds, gar
nets and samphires, but now there. is a
great demand for mlneralogical gems,
such as the tourmaline, zircon,' star
ruby, asteria, titanite, cat's-eyes, etc
If a stone is hard enough to scratch
quartz, but is soft enough to be
scratched by a topaz, I know"it belongs
to the group tabulated between quartz
and topaz. If it scratches topaz, but
can be scratched by a sapphire, I know
it ?s of a hardness between topaz and
sapphire. Thus if a stone claimed to be

Metropolitan Wild West.
The passersby at the intersection of
Market, Sixth and Taylor streets were
treated to a grand free exhibition of
bronco riding and buck-jumping yes
terday that put any Wild West show
way into the shade. About 2 o'clock a
tough-looking cowboy, mounted on a
wild-eyed bronco pony, came along
Market street, leading a pair of car
riage horses by a long rope. When the
pony got to Sixth street he stopped,
and suddenly whirling around wound
the long rope about the cowboy's body,
thereby nearly dismounting him. The
boy straightened things out and again
tried to start the pony. It was no go.
The same performance was repeated
over ana over again. Then the cowboy
got mad. He yelled to a boy to hold
the big horses.
Then the fun began, to the amuse
ment of the great crowd that had col
lected. The cowboy had no spurs, but
he did have a lariat, with a big knot
in the end oi it. He got the pony into
the middle of the street and lie hi- him
, a tremendous whack 'under the belly.
The pony gave a snort and made a fly
ing leap into the air. This was the
opening of The fight.
Â» The pony ran; on his lilnu; legs, kicked
and then cave the greatest show o:

Nobody can gainsay the fact that the
French are at least original. The prize
competitions lately la"ncJed with such
sensational succer â¢ * y the French
newspapers have many interesting pre
cedents. There was once a Journal, Le
Croque-mort, -which offered as & prize
for competition a free plat of ground
In a cemetery; but this grim proposal
did not attract its readers. A more
cheerful proposal was that of Le Bien
faisant, which offered free medical at
tendance and gratuitous drugs to its
subscribers for the nominal considera
tion of 50 centimes a â onth. The most
curious competition of all, however,
was that of La Guillotine. This Jour
nal, which was appropriately printed in
red type, organized a prize competition
of which the prize was a free seat at
a first-floor window, to witness an ex
ecution.
Piquant Competition, fl
IN view of the widespread interest attaching to the recent
reduction of the wages of cotton spinners and weavers
' of the Fall River mills in Massachusetts the special re
port df'the Census Bureau on "Employes and Wages" just
issued has an added significance. This compendium of the
results of the 1900 census of 720 manufacturing institutions,
which has been prepared by Professor Davis R., Dewey of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, presents the
tabulations of statistics upon thirty-four industries and 304
occupations connected with these. Wherever possible com
parisons have been made with the census reports upon the
same manufacturing concerns for .1890. A classification of
wage scales according to geographical sections is also ap
pended.
The first striking deduction to be made from the o compari
son of the statistics of 1800 and 1900 is that the specialization
of skilled labor is yearly becoming more complex. The
increased use of machinery, the employment of machines to
do the work which was ten ye e ars ago the province of the
hands, the growth of new industries attendant upon the ad
vances of scientific discoveries â all these conditions have de
veloped the.remarkable segregation of skilled labor into
minutely specialized branches of activity. As a corollary to
this condition the fact that there is at present a larger field
for unskilled labor than formerly existed is demonstrated by
the statistics. The skilled mechanic, who ten years ago con
trolled the operations of one machine while his associates
completed the production of the manufactured article by- the
work of their hands, has been forced to give way to six me
chanics whose engines now leave nothing to be fashioned
by the fingers.
The natural result of this leveling of the barriers between
skilled mechanics and heretofore unskilled operatives has
been to equalize the earning powers of the two classes. The
skilled mechanic of ten years ago is not now so efficient a
factor in production, and consequently the rate of wages of
the few has been cut down to meet the demands of the many
who now claim an equality of skill. While in a given indus
try there may not be as high a maximum mark of wages as
formerly' the average rate of pay shows a considerable in
crease on account of the increased production and the larger
staff of machine operatives necessitated.
There are many conditions which prevent an exact de
termination of a possible general increase Â©f wages during
the ten years past. The fluctuating purchasing power of the
laborer's wage under the conditions of locality and the vary
ing retail prices of the necessities of life rendtT such a con
clusion null. Again until some common factor can -be de
viled to subtend the conditions of wages in different pur
suits and under the many local influences controlling labor
no exact comparison between the wage rate of 1890 and 1900
can be drawn.
"Six hundred and " gasped the
woman. "Why, that's outrageous. The
jeweler next door has a necklace in his
window, every bit as good as this, for
57."
A pioneer Jeweler, noted for his col
lectionjof precious stones, who recently
moved his establishment from Post
street to Market street, has about
reached the conclusion that his move
was an unwise one, and all because he
happened to select as his new location
a building surrounded by others de
voted to the use of "Jewelers," so
called, who sell the kind of jewels
that are made to Suit the fancy of those
who like finery but who have not the
price of the genuine article.
A few days ago this merchant had
on exhibition in his window a hand
some diamond necklace. A tag in
formed the passers-by that it could be
purchased for $685. It had been on ex
hibition about an hour when a woman
about 35 years of age, attired in an
up-to-date but rather loud* costume,
walked in and asked to be shown the
necklace. She held it up to the light,
breathed on each of the stones, rubbed
the moisture off on her fur cap* and
then said, "I'll take it."
She opened her purse, while the jew
eler was wrapping up the valuable ar
ticle, and when he was about to hand
the package to her she placed on the
showcase a $5 gold piece, a silver dol
lar and 85 cents in small change. As
tounded, the merchant took a fresh
hold upon the package, ' which the
woman had already grasped, pulled it
from her hand and informed her that
the crice was S6S5.

The stuffed specimen of the second
largest giraffe In the world will be ex
hibited at the World's Fair. It is now
being prepared by the taxidermists of
the National Museum- at Washington.
This giraffe will not only be high in
stature, but will also be the most valu
able animal in the world. This is owing
to the fact that the papier mache used
in its construction is the ground-up
pulp of thousands of $1, $2, $5, $10 and
$20 bills from the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing.
A complete shoe factory In operation,
illustrating the many Improvements in
the art of shoemaking and the latest
machinery for all minor detail work
will be shown in the Manufacturers'
building at the World's Fair. Skilled
and rapid operators will have charge of
the machines and the handling of the
machines. Many novelties in the way
of shoe machinery and shoes will also
be on exhibition.
In Idaho bees feed on alfalfa and
produce a honey that Is almost as
transparent as glass. This feature will
tie shown in a unique honey exhibit in
the Palace of Agriculture at the World's

In America It is known as a "dug

nineteen cruisers (with eight building),

The good prices ruling for'farra products, especially grain
and cotton, inspire confidence, and even the industries,
which have lately been the subjects of much complaint and
foreboding, seem to be in rather better condition. The re
cent decline in quotations for crude iron is apparently help
ing the iron and steel market, though the improvement is
irregular and slight. Structural goods, however, are meet
ing with a good demand and colder weather has perceptibly
stimulated the. movement in clothing, woolen goods and
footwear. There is also a good holiday trade and present
prospects are that the Christmas retail trade of the country
will be large. Abundant crops, too, are having their effect,
and imports instead of exports jof gold from Europe are
doing much to keep the money market easier than was
thought probable some months ago, and there is nothing
that inspires confidence like the knowledge that there is
plenty of money to meet all necessities likely to rise.
The situation is aptly expressed by Daniel F. Kellogg,
financial editor of the New York Sun, who writes: "Three
great factors differentiate the present business, situation from
times in past years with which parallels are now commonly
drawn. They are, first, an absence of all troubles affecting
the currency and the presence of a huge volume of money
in the country, half of it in actual gold; second, the" well
nigh total liquidation of the debts of the Western farming
population and a* general condition' in the West of financial
affluence and social contentment; third, a foreign trade bal
ance very heavily in our favor. All this does not spell 1893
or anything like it."
The statistical position of the country does not make a
bad showing. True, the bank clearings continue to exhibit
a decrease from corresponding periods in 1902, the loss last
week being 18.3 per cent, but it must not be forgotten that
last year at this time trade was abnormally and dangerously
active, with prices- high and the public buying everything in
sight without much regard to cost. This was the state of
affairs that caused apprehension among the level-headed
financiers and merchants of the country. They feared the
outcome of this cheerful disregard of money. The land
seemed full of spendthrifts, scattering funds right and left,
building, speculating, expanding, pleasure seeking and trav
eling. Predictions of a panic began to be heard. Another
1893 was thought to be impending. But, thanks to the stern
action of the great banking interests, which contracted their
loans and promptly frowned upon plunging by their cus
tomers, the descent from the dizzy heights of extravagance
to the safer plain of conservatism, \.hi readjustment to the
more normal basis, has thus far been attended by little real
disaster. Though sundry vast combinations have been vivi
sected to their grief and the country's edification, that was
merely the penalty previous folly and recognized as such
by the public at large.
A year or two ago nobody thought of rigidly investi
gating new projects involving the absorption of millions of
capital; now it is a difficult matter to float any new thingâ
not because money is scarce, for it is not, but because the
public want to know where their money is going and who is
to handle it. The proposition of passing one's spare cash
over to half a dozen men and telling them to invest it as they
see fit no longer prevails. The day of the gigantic trusts
has been like the day of the alligator, which basks in the sun
with his i cavernous mouth agape and when his tongue gets
covered with mosquitoes and gnats snaps his jaws together
and swallows a million of them at one mouthful and then
lazily opens his jaws for another cargo. The trust is such
an alligator and the people are the gnats.
The failures for the week were 167, against 182 for the
same week last year, but few of them were serious.' The
railroad earnings thus far in November are 5.2 per cent
larger than during the same time in 1902. Money in New
York is now somewhat higher than for the past few months,
fluctuating around 5 and 6 per cent, but in 1002 at this time
it was four or five times as. high, scarce and feverish. There
is no fever now and Europe is sending us large shipments of
gold in payment for our grain and cotton. :
There is nothjng new in the staples worthy of especial
comment. The grain markets continue quiet and feature
less owing to excellent crops throughout the world. Provis
ions still droop at the Western packing points and the pack
ers arc not supporting their markets. Lumber is in good
demand for export, but the local inquiry in the East and
West is reported lighter. An enormous quantity of cotton
is waiting So be marketed and the Southern planters arc
profiting unprccedentedly through the high prices. The
close of navigation fof the winter is largely increasing She
business of the Western railroads, but complaints of ca?
shortage arc not often heard. Wholesale grocers afong She
Atlantic seaboard report art Â«xcellent and continuous demand

IvHE markets of the country showed rather more tone
last week. Private and press advices from New York

gradually succeeded by confidence in the future. It is

CHEERING MERCANTILE REPORTS.

I say once more as I have said so
often in the marriage service: "Mar

God." I sav with Goethe: "Marriage

4. The benefit of ballast! It is of
enormous importance to every one to
have weights and burdens imposed
upon him in life. We get "flighty"
without them, like balloons; we reel
and pitch like ships; we throw our feet
like trotting horses. What we need is
gravity! Something must hold us down!
5. Incentive. This is the deepest need
of life. As the years multiply the dan
ger of every living soul lies In the dis
covery of the vanity of existence! When
we see how little the struggle amounts
to, that fatal cry / rises from broken
hearts to trembling lips, "What's the
use?" Weariness, lassitude, ennui/pes
simism â these are the ro*es of all men
and women who are not driven to their
tasks by stern 'necessity or impelled by
some divine incentive. But is there any
other such incentive as a wife and a
brood of little children? How they
keep men up to their work! With the
thought 'ht thesVTdear objects In their
minds, how fathers march up to cannon
mouths! How mothers dare the deadly
foes and do the impossible deeds of life.
Impelled by the love of their families!
Take that incentive out of the world
and how long do you suppose all other
incentives whatsoever would goad hu
manity toward its goal? How long
would the mere desire for fame or the
love of money or the lust of power In
cite men and women to heroism and to
ceaseless endeavor?
3. The comfort of friendship. Even in
marriages that are not ideal, where the
deepest love has never been developed,
where there has been much living at
cross purposes and even unhapplness
and bitterness, there is liable to' be an
Incalculable amount of sympathetic
companionship. Mutual duties force
even incompatible people into such inti
mate relationships that a spirit of com
raderie is developed. Let even an ill
mated couple think of the hours of
sweet companionship that their check
ered careers I have known (which no
other possible relationship could have
procured) and, they must feel that it is
well to take the bitter for the sweet.
loved is like being a bird and never
have flown! Who has not loved has not
lived! This is true in the sairie sense
that it is true that who has not
thought or felt or acted has not lived.
The most wonderful and meaningful of
all the phases of life has been untried
and unknown by those who have not
loved.
mate of California does not present these extremes. It is a
warm blanket, that covers the State from end to end.
The monthly report of the Weather Bureau for October,
issued by Director McAdie, is just out and is full of very in
teresting information. It gives an elaborate table of daily
temperatures at sixty-eight points in the State. The study
of the mean lowest temperature for the month discloses
facts that cannot be too widely advertised. >The mean lowest
temperature for the month was, at Los Angeles 53.7, at Oak
land 54.5, at Red Bluff 54.3, at Sacramento 52.5, at San Diego
56.9, at San Francisco 54.9, at Shasta 56.0. We have here
Oakland, San Francisco and Shasta a 'perceptible shade
higher in a mean minimum than Los Angeles, while Shasta,
nearly 800. miles north of San Diego, shows about the same
minimum.
Going to the mean maximum temperature for the month
we. find Los Angeles 78.9, while in Northern California Red
/'bluff had 80.6, Sacramento 79.8, Santa Rosa 79, Shasta 82,
Tulare 87, Upper Lake 8o, Visalia 87, Fresno 83.4 and Wil
lows 79.3- From this Eastern people will see clearly how
little north and south have to do with climate and tempera
tures in California. When Shasta shows a higher maximum
and minimum than Los Angeles and Southern California it
is easily understoodVwhy we have the same production all
ever the State and that our climate knows no north and no
south.
A -well-known collector of bad debts
dropped into the reporter's rooms at
the City Hall the other day and re
quested permission to use the tele
phone. The permission was granted
him and for 'five minutes only the roar
of his voice could be heard.
When the collector got through he
was red in "the face and perspiring,
and what he said when he left the tele
phone box and slammed the door was
not what is commonly called polite
language.
"I've Just got rid of the toughest case
I have had in my twenty-five years'
experience as. a collector," he explained
to the newspaper men who were sitting
around wondering what had happened
to disturb his usual serenity. "I'd go
out of the business if I had many more
like him. Just twelve years ago I was
given the task of collecting from him
$20 that he owed a downtown mer
chant. I chased him for two years
without getting a cent, and then he
came to me and wanted to know if he
could not make arrangements to pay
the bill in installments and rid himself
of the annoyance he said I caused him.
I was only too glad to accept his of
fer, and at his request prepared for his
signature a paper which was an
agreement to pay me weekly what he
could until the account was settled.
That paper came near driving me in
sane, for regularly once a week, for
520 weeks, ten .years, mind you, that
fellow came Into my office, paid me a
nickel, got his receipt and walked out."

several minor wounds on his face and
body, but none of thesse is serious. The
physicians say that the breast wound
is not necessarily fatal.
Cooper and his friends were arrested
soon after the affray by Officers Tom
Murphy and Skelly. Cooper was under
the influence of liquor and unable to
make a statement. He was positively
identified by Tierney as the man that
stabbed him. Cooper's friends will be
held as witnesses.
Tierney says that he demanded the

is alleged to have Jumped down and
stabbed Tierney several times with the
knife. The entire 'party then fled,
leaving Tierney lying on the ground.
According to Tlerney's etory, Cooper
went to the place where the first-named

Alexanaer Damon and his sister-in
law, Mrs. John Damon, were held up
and robbed by a highwayman at Stan
yan and Fulton streets early Saturday
morning. The knight of the road car
ried a revolver, which he pressed
against the forehead of one of his vic
tims. Damon was armed with a pistol
himself, but he did not have timÂ© to
draw it and the thief took It from him.
Mrs. Damon was compelled to hand
over her purse and was badly fright
ened. The crime was reported to the
police and the captain of deteotlves de
tailed two men to make an Investiga
tion. Thus far no arrest has been
made.
Damon Is employed with his brother
by H. L. S^hnier at the corner of
Haight and Stanyan streets. They are
engaged in the hotel business, and it
is the custom of Mrs. John Damon to
assist in tho restaurant every Friday
night. Both brothers and Mrs. Damon
usually go home together about 1
o'clock in the morning, when the place
closes, b\it Saturday John was obliged
to remain behind for a time and his
brother and his wife started away
alone in- the direction of 2528 Fulton
street, where they all live. The pair
walked down Stanyan street and were
nearing Fulton, when a highwayman,
masked and holding a large revolver In
his hand, Jumped from a doorway and
commanded them to hold up their
hands.
Damon had a pistol in his pocket, but
he had no opportunity to reach for it
and obeyed the command of the robber.
Mrs. Damon hesitated for a moment,
but the weapon was pointed in her
direction and she compiled. The high
wayman approached Damon, pressed
the muzzle of 'his revolver against his
forehead and commenced his search.
First he took the revolver that was In
hiB victim's back pocket, and as he did
so remarked that it was a good thing
that Damon did. not attempt to draw
it. Then he took what small change
he could find, amounting to but 60
cents. â¢ '
After the robber had finished -with
the man he turned to Mrs. Damon, who
still held her hands above her head.
"I eruess you had better give me what
you have," he said, and Indicated a
purse she carried in her hand. Mrs.
Damon handed over the article and the
robber, turned and bade the pair good
night. As he did so he told them to
keep going and not to make an out
cry. Then he ran Into the Park and
disappeared among the shrubbery.
Both Damon and hl3 sister-in-law de

fixed so long as the number of teachers
does not fall below 1000. If the number
of teachers is raised the yearly income
would increase in proportion.
PENSION LIST IS SMALL
We now have forty-one annuitants of
the School Department, some of whom
have served thirty years, while others
have served twenty years and are dis
qualified by Illness.
With $24,000 a year guaranteed we would
be able to look after the old teachers.
The money would be divided pro rata.
With" a School Department that Is fifty
years old we only have forty-one teachers
drawing annuities. The percentage of
teachers that serves for twenty or thirty
years is very small and there Is no rea
son to suppose that the yearly fund se
cured from the raise of J2 a month In
salaries would ever be Insufficient to take
care of the teachers that desire to retire"
after' long service.
There are many teachers to-day in the
schools that should be drawing annui
ties. They have given the best years of
their lives to teaching and their health
has failed. Yet they continue to teach
because there la no guarantee that they
will be given an annuity sufficient to live,
on.
If the annuity fund is established on
the lines proposed it is possible that many
teachers would apply for retirement at
once. With each succeeding year the
number added to the annuity roll would
be steady, but a very small percentage of
the total number of teachers.
The School Department would be bene
fited if it were possible for a number of
teachers to retire on annuities. It would
allow younger teachers to come in and
bring vigor that is lacking.
MISS KATE OROWLEY SPEAKS.
Miss Kate H. Crowley, principal of
the Mission Grammar School, guve her
views on the annuity question yester
day as follows:
The present annuity fund la not on a
substantial basis. I do not think, how
ever, that a pension of $50 a month should
be paid. It should be smaller. I favor
an annuity fund being created by the
teachers themselves. There Is always op
position to the State paying pensionB v to
teachers, for it is always claimed that
they are well paid.
To raise a fund large enough to give a
pension to every teacher Is not thought
of. But a small percentage of the teach
ers serve for twenty or thirty years.
I think the plan to raise the salaries
would give sufficient means to take eare
of those teachers entitled to an annuity.
Alice M. and Emma Stincen, prin
cipals respectively of the. Pacific
Heights 'and Whittler Schools, made
the following statement yesterday:
We are heartily in favor of a $2 raise In
salaries, thi3 extra money to be devoted
to the pension fund. I think that is the
sentiment of all the school teachers. We
would then be on the same footing as the
firemen and policemen, who are allowed
extra money, the same to go into their
pension fund. The money, thus raised
would be sufficient tor pay annuities to the
small proportion of teachers that serves
the term of years entitling teachers to a
pension.
Principal Joseph O'Connor of the Mis
sion High School, when Interviewed,
said:
This annuity proposition can never be
made a success. The pension fund is
the only one that will work. The school
teachers should be provided with a pen
sion fund. There are three classes of pub
lic employesâ the firemen, policemen and
the school teachers. The latter are the
most poorly paid in proportion to the ser
vices they render and no provision is
made for them in the way of a pension
fund. The United States has the best
public school system in the world. Every
one has the opportunity to gain learning.
Yet its old teachers receive no consid
eration for their faithful work, while all
the countries In Europe retire their teach
ers on a pension, which many times Is
in excess of 50 per cent of what they were
receiving in active service. The teachers
of this city do receive an average salary
of $80 a month. It is not the intention of
the fathers of this movement to expect
to give every one in the department a
pension. A comparatively small number
of the teachers In tho department teach
until they reach . the retirement age.
Many get married and leave the service.
A pension fund such aa the other public
empolyes receive is the only feasible plan
for caring for the retired members of the
department.
In an interview Miss Ida M. Kervan
of the "Washington Grammar School
said:
I think the proposition is a good one,
but who ever got it up made a great mis
take In stating what the extra $2 to be
demanded was to be used for. What dif
ference does it make what we use the
extra money demanded for? The teach
ers receive little enough pay as it is.
Wages of all the worklngmen have been
Increased, but ours have remained the
same. The price of provisions and every
thing necessary to life has been increased
Almost every woman in the> department
has some one depending on her and we
cannot afford to contribute to a pension
or annuity fund unless our salaries are
increased.

constitutional. The $1 per month re

LAWS LEGALITY DOUBTED.
Â£o far as is kr.own no effort was made
to take "ndvantase" of this law ex
cept in this city. Certain teachers
approaching the age of retirement did or
ganize a club, whore members paid in an
argregate of $6246 P7 for two years. As It
v.-as plain that an income of $3000 a year
would not pay many pensions of $C00 a
jear and as the younger teachers showed
very little alacrity in joining, the Legis
lature, by an act approved March 9, 1S97,
provided that in this city it should be
compulsory on all teachers thereafter
elected to come Into the deal, but that in-
Ftead of contributing 1 per cent of their
pnlary they should pay each $1 a month
ell around and receive pensions of $30 a
rncnth. A substitute teacher happening
to teach one day in a given month at $3
e day would contribute one-third of her
monthly income to the fund, while a prin
cipal of a high school at $250 a month
would contribute two-fifths of one per
cent. The law was further amended and
rr-rfractfMl In 1901.
Teachers were to pay in 1 per cent of
their salaries, and upon retirement after
twenty years of service and contribution
were to receive pensions of $45 per month
during life and after twenty-live years'
pervice or more were to receive 530 a
month. Shorter periods of payment car
ried correspondingly reduced monthly
pensions.

Proposition to Raise Sal
' aries for Purpose
Considered.
We do not purpose establishing an an
nuity fund on the lines of a life insurance
company. In a life insurance company
each person joining the organization and
keeping up the payments is entitled to
the benefits at some future time either
by receiving, a lump sum of money or the
same being paid to heirs or executors. ,
All that we ask is that the city raise
the salaries of the teachers $2 a month,
the extra $2 being placed in the annuity
fund. This will give a yearly income of
$21,000 or more. This Income would be
Their contention is /that they should
not be called upon to pay to the fund be
causo they will not participate in Its bene
fits later on.
Out of 1000 teachers COO are helping the
annuity fund by belonging to the Teach
ers' Annuity Association. That is while
each teacher is compelled by law to give
$1 a month to the annuity fund 600 teach
ers are voluntarily subscribing to the an
nuity association in order to help out the
annuity fund established by law.
The only opposition that comes to the
annuity fund is from some of the young
women teachers who do not intend to re
main in the department and from some of
the male teachers who are holding posi
tions In order to better themselves later
on.
This Increase of $2 a month has been
given to the Police and Fire Depart
ments and the money goes into their re
spective pension funds.
For the last nine years the teachers
have paid $1 each a month into the an
nuity fund as required by law.. The bur
den is now becoming too great for them
to bear and that is why we are asking the
city to help us out.
We do not claim for one moment that
the $2 a month to be taken from each
teacher's salary would give sufficient
funds to pay a pension to every teacher
In the department after twenty years or
thirty years of service as the case may be.
Statistics collected by the United
States Census Bureau show, that the per
sonnel of the "schools in this country
change every five years. Assuming that
the personnel of the teachers in San
Francisco changes every ten years we
would not be called upon to give pensions
to very many teachers.
TEACHERS ASSIST THE FUND.
There Is perhaps no teacher In the
School Department who is more quali
fied to speak on the question of an
nuities and pensions for teachers than
Mrs. Mary Prag of the Girls' High
School.
Mrs. Prag has made a study of the
subject for many years and she has
collected valuable data from all parta
of the world bearing on the subject.
Mrs. Prag was seen at her residence
yesterday and in giving her views on
the subject said:
I am sorry to see that there Is any dis
position on the part of any one to attack
the proposed raiee of salaries of the
school teachers in order to provide an
nuities.
MBS. MARY PRAGr'S VIEWS.
It la now proposed to amend the plan
by Inducing the Board of Education to
raise "salaries" $2 per month, the ex
cess to be retained and paid to the an
nuity fund, and all teachers upon retire
ment to receive a pension of $50 a month
for life â a payment to which those who
joined under L the original law are-"en
titled," but do not get. As already
stated, this additional $2 would be the
property of the teachers, which the pub
lic cannot constitutionally confiscate, or
public money which cannot bÂ« constitu
tionally given away. It Is \ very desir
able indeed that teachers should have
annuities. If their salaries were $200 a
month not one in ten of them would
save enough out of It to pay for an an
nuity. It is a difficult problem to deal
with. But this is certain: An actuary
should first be set to compute the actual
cost of the annuities, and the funds to
pay them without fall should be provid
ed. And every teacher who pays In a dol
lar should have a legal claim on what
ever that dollar pays for, regardless of
the cause of her retirement from the de
partment. It is not public policy to en
courage race suicide by discouraging the
marriage of teachers by depriving them
of their pensions If they do marry. â¢ The
city of San Francisco cannot afford to
officially engage in the business of sell
ing gilded bricks. Annuities cost money
and should be paid for by those who get
them.
SAYS PROBLEM IS HARD.
ers entering and retiring at all ages
would be a very complicated problem for
an actuary. The department clerks at
Washington attempted to arrange such.
jl plan and paid, according to reports,
about $2500 to an actuary to make the
calculation. 'He reported that it was
difficult almost beyond comprehension
to work out the mathematical j formula
for the cost of annuities upon retire
ment for disability or at a fixed age
(in that case 70 years), but he did it.
Tho cost, however, was found prohibi
tory and the plan had to be abandoned.
Those figures could doubtless be ob
tained if desired. Our teachers' retire
ment fund is based on no mathematical
calculations. As a legitimate insurance
plan it is absurd. It is not fraternal,
for consent is not asked. So far as it
supceeds it does so by confiscation and
other illegal or improper practices. And
it cannot succeed even with them.
DRUNKEN MAN
WIELDS KNIFE
It Ib evident that this cannot last
long. It Is not lasting:. Already the re
ceipts fall to pay the demands, which are
being scaled. No reference is made to a
"permanent fund" of $50,00) which is
being accumulated, because its income
can never make good the deficit; nor has
it been attempted to describe all the com
plicated provisions of the act. Nor
does our illustration show the precise
Â¦workings of the law, because- the fund
is swelled by confiscating the payments
of teachers who retire from other causes
than "dipability." But the illustration
shows the result as it would be If there
were no confiscation, no unconstitutional
gifts of public money, and nothing got
from the charity of the public.
It Is of the essence of just, scientific
Insurance that each insured person pays
for exactly what he gets, plus loading
for commissions and expenses, or when,
as in rtfrs case, the expenses are little or
nothing, the cost without loading. Any
thing else is gambling or charity, or, as
in this case, confiscation. An insurance
company takes your money, invests
it and estimates to pay you in install
ments as agreed your total investment
plus compound interest at current rates
â at present 3% per cent â less the
loading, whatever it may be. If you die
early It makes money on iyou. If you
live long it loses. On the average It
makes its estimated profit. To devise
an equitable plan of insurance for teach-
teacher. If it Is public money the Legis
lature certainly cannot apply It to pay
pensions. If it belongs to the teacher
the Legislature cannot lawfully confis
cate it, and that in most cases is the ef
fect of the law. There is no possibility
of paying the pensions required by the act
from the fund produced by the payments
required. Some additions 'to the fund
are provided by way of gifts from the
public treasury, which are probably ille
gal.
These consist of forfeits from teachers
salariesâ that is, money not earned and
therefore belonging to the public. No
body grudges this money, but tho Legis
lature has no authority to sequestrate it
and bestow it on individuals, and some
body may seme time object. It cannot
b>- reckonpd as an asset. There Is also a
chance for gifts and bequests. The one
thing which can be depended on so long
as it is raid is one dollar per month from
each teacher elected since March 27, 1901,
and from such teachers at that time In
the department as have signified their
acceptance of the provisions of the act.
The impossibility of making the pay
ments from the fund provided by assess
ments is readily seen. A teacher enter
ing the department at 20 years of age and
serving 30 years would bo 60 years of
ape and have paid In $360. She would be
entitled to a pension of $30 a monthâ that
is, Fhe would, during the first year, draw
out of the fund every dollar she had ever
put in. Who would pay the remainder?
Obviously the other teachers. If with
their consent, that ?s charity. If without
thctlr consent, it Is confiscation. And It
would be no small sum. The teachers'
expectation of life at the age of 60 is
20.91 years. For one year she has
paid her own pension. For the other
IP.f'l years it must be paid by others, if
paid at all. It would amount, during her
expectation, to $7167 60. An Insurance
company would charge for an annuity of
J3P0 a year, payable quarterly, from the
ago of 50, $5092 40. How much of this is
loading for commissions and expenses does
not appear* but It will not exceed 7% per
cent. Call it 10 per cent, and $5123 16 re
mains as tho actual cost of an an
nuity which it is proposed to give
for a payment of $360. This mill
is already ir. operation. Any teacher ap
proaching the age of retirement was. al
lowed to become entitled to the full pen
sion upon paying into the fund the sum
which she would have paid In the course
of 30 years had the fund been In exist
ence. All tho teachers who have been re
tired seem to have availed themselves of
this provision, and drew out during the
first year more money than they ever
put in.

Tie Game at Oakland.
The final struggle on the Oakland
diamond ended in a tie after nine
rounds of lively going. San Francisco
took the lead in the third Inning, when
with two on the bags Tommy Leahy
hit the ball right over the left field
fence for a homer, the first one of its
kind since the lamented Rube Waddell
sent' the ball soaring over the same
spot for the longest drive ever seen on
the grounds. During the progress of
the eighth the Cripples took advantage
of LJndsey's wlldness and landed for
four runs, enough to tie up the score
and keep the deadlock till the end. The

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29.â The base
ball season of 1903 closed with the game
this afternoon. The champions won as
they pleased by the score of ; 11 to 6.
The game was made interesting only by
the terrific batting of both teams.
There was a general ] air, of listlessness
among the players and errors were nu
merous. An exhibition game followed
the last scheduled game. It became so
slow and tiresome that Umpire McDon
ald called time after* five Jnnings with
the score 4 ' to 2 in favor ] of ; Seattle.
There will be a benefit game for the
Los Angeles champions next Sunday,
when the big leaguers now; wintering
here will make-up the 'team to play

INGLESIDE PARK STAKE
IS TAKEN BY GLATJCUS
Defeats the One-to-Tvro Choice Sofala
in Deciding Course â Fog Ob
scures Coursing.
According to the reports of Judge
Thomas Tierney the open stake at In
gleside Coursing Park yesterday was
far above the standard. From a spec
tator's point of view there was "noth
ing to it." Just after luncheon a fog
settled over the park and obscured all
view of the running. Slipper Shorstag
turned the dogs loose in the heavy mist
without once allowing a hound to run
unsighted. Glaucus romped through
the stake. In a long deciding course
that went more than the limit she beat
out the fast Solafa, the 1 to 2 choice.
Following are the day's results, with
Judge Thomas Tierney's official" scores:
Open stake, second round â Dorothy beat

..} England makes but a third- of the ma
chinery used by Its farmers. The remain
der. $1,308.000 , worth - of it,: comes -from
America, and $212^000 worth from Canada,
After the eventful first inning no runs
showed till the final one came through
in the eighth. Both pitchers worked
well and , the batters kept" going but
one, two, three. Meany was hit, by % 'a
pitched ball in the eighth. .He^ went
around to third while Irwin was be
ing put out, Rockenfield to Messerly.
It remained for Heine Krug to score
All the way through the game was a
pretty one to look upon. A few errors
marred the work of the fielders, but
every man seemed full of life and gin
ger and played the best he knew how.
The day was a perfect one, and the
bleechers and stands were well filled
with fans anxious for a parting glance
at the familiar faces.
San Francisco opened the game
strongly and made two of their three
runs in a twinkling. Shay let four bad
ones pass him and Meany sacrificed.
Irwin lined a torrid one to Devereaux.
Brick picked up the ball, but could not
recover in time to retire Irwin at first.
The multitude cheered as Tommy
Leahy advanced, bat in hand. Tommy
responded with a drive to the flag pole,
a real two-bagger, that sent Shay tear-
Ing home and sent Irwin to third. The
applause had hardly died away ere
Heine Krug shoved a bouncer o\'er the
second bag, and Irwin came tripping
inp while Leahy went to third.
Then the most brilliant play of the
game was pulled off. Lynch landed di
rectly on the solar plexus of the first
one that Cooper tossed up. Away it
soared in the direction of the center
garden. O'Hara was under it in a
trice and nailed It as it came down.
With a mighty whip to the plate he
caught Leahy by five feet and com
pleted the last double play of the sea
son.
Jimmy Whalen was the most popular
man on the San Francisco team. It
was through his grand efforts that the
natives landed with the parting game
to their' credit. He pitcned masterly
ball from the tap of the gong and never
for a moment did he let up till the last
man was put out and the danger point
was passed.
There were two on the bags when
Pete came up for his parting swing at
the leather. Devereaux was on third
and Kruger was hugging the iirst bag.
Pete grabbed his bat and surveyed the
field. He longed to make a hit and
save his team the dishonor of a shut
out in the last engagement of the sea
son, but the best he had was a pop
to Danny Shay and then all was at an
end for the season of 1903.
to 0. Hard luck interfered in the morn
ing contest and it ended' a tie, 7 to 7,
after nine innings of strife.
As each player stepped, to the bat
for the last time this season he was
extended the Joyous mitt of welcome by
the multitude. There was a cheer for
every performer and good T/lshes for
him in the future, whether it be his
fortune to play ball in the Pacific Coast
League or elsewhere.
It remained for the venerable Peter
Lohman to come in for the most mighty
round of applause of the day. Perhaps
the fans thought it was coming to Peter
on account of his age or it may have
been because he wag the last man at
bat, but at all events Peter was a pop
ular man for' a few moment;?.

The members of the ring pitchforked
the talent about at Oakland Saturday
Just as a New Hampshire farmer han
dles hay with a thunder stcrm ap
proaching.
The many tood "breaks" the books
received came as a great relief, for
many of the feather-jveight bank rolls
were beginning to assume a gaunt look
and up to Saturday their owners kept
as keen a lookout for a change as do
a cluster of shipwrecked mariners on
a life raft straining their -yes for a
sail.
Neither side scored yesterday in the
first period. The whites were the first
to get in action and Charley Dunphy
and Lawrence McCreery ran the ball
down to the reds' goal in ha!r a minute
of play. They were unable tc score.
They kept it around the reds' goal and
Tom Driscoll was compelled to drive
outside. Under this year's rules a "safe
ty" allows the opposing team a free hit
for goal from the thirty-five-yard line.
The other team is permitted to line up
and prevent the ball going between the
posts, if possible.
Tom Driscoll broke the deadlock In
the second period. With the assistance
of Cyril Tobin he ran the nail down the
field and finally drove it between the
posts. He used his clever pony Little
Jack Homer in this period. Walter Mc-
Creery scored for the whites just as the
bell sounded the end or the period.
The second and last goal of the game
for the whites was scored in the fourth
period by Lawrence McCreery.
Cyril Tobin made some sensational
backhand strokes which saved his
team from being scored against several
times. The horsemanship displayed by
all the players was of the highest class.
Owing to the lack of condition of the
ponies the play was not particularly
fast, especially toward the end of the
game. It takes more than running a
clipping machine over a pony to make
it fit to gallop.
The McCreery brothers each contrib
uted a point to the score of tha winning
team, while Tom Driscoll saved the reds
from being blanked. The reds missed a
second goal by inches, Lawrence Mc-
Creery deflecting the ball by a stroke of
his mallet aB it was about to roll be
tween the posts.
The club stand was thronged with
spectators, while automobiles and
smart traps provided coigns o/ vantage
from which many well-known people
witnessed the game. It Is evident that
this is to be the greatest season of polo
ever seen here. With the coming of the
English players and then the Hawaiian
team next spring the followers of the
fascinating pastime have some sensa
tional games In prospect. The electric
cars which pass the field take many
spectators from this city.
The polo players of Burllngame Coun
try Club, wearing the white jackets,
scored their second victory of the week
yesterday over the reds. The score was
close, being two goals to one. The
teams lined up:

The shooting at Shell Mound Park
yesterday was good. The riflemen found
climatic conditions just to their taste.
Captain Frank K. Moore of Company
C, First Infantry Regiment, National
Guard of California, made the fine score
of forty-nine points out of a possible
fifty. As the shooting was done on the
Blunt target this is the highest mili
tary score made during the year.
William F. Garms, In the turkey shoot
of the Norddeutscher Schuetzen Club
made the high score of seventy-three
rings out of a possible seventy-rive, be
ing the highest made on this target for
a number of years. As there is but one
entry allowed It will be seen that vet
eran Garms is still able to hold his own
with the best of riflemen.
Herman Huber showed well in the
medal competition of the ,same club,
scoring 433 rings in his string. He was
closely followed by F. P. Schuster, who
finished with 42S to his credit.
The principal event or the day was
the ending of the annual medal shoot
of Company C, First Regiment. The
silver medal competed for yesterday
was presented to the compary twenty
years ago and not until George Sey
den placed forty-two points to his cred
it was it won three times in succession.
A gold medal was presented at the
same time to be competed for under
similar conditions. This medal was won
by Captain Frank K. Moore. Two cash
prizes were also offered for ilrst and
third places. Captain F. K. Moore won
the first prize of $15 and Lieutenant
William Corcoran the second prize of
$10. The members of the company will
hereafter confine their shootiiiz to the
Blunt target, as they believe it is con
ducive to better marksmanshio.
Following are the scores:
Occidentals â Smith. McCarty. Higgins.
Hajcs, Lloyd. Bowden. F. Holland. Condon.
V. Holland <captaln>. Evans. F. Robertson.
Thistles â Lowe, Tierney, Forrest (captain),
Taylor. Duncan. McGregor, A. Disher, Strans,
T. Lydon, Smith. R. Disher.
On the Presidio athletic grounds yes
terday morning the Thistles won an
easy victory from the Occidental asso
ciation football eleven, scoring six goals
to one. The ball was kicked off at
10:30 o'clock, the Thistles defending
the north goal.
In a few minutes the Thistles made a
shot at the Occidentals' goal, which the
goalkeeper relieved. A moment after
ward a second shot resulted in a goal.
A lone shot with the left foot by Ly
don at an acute angle resulted in a
second goal for the Thistles. Three
more goals followed in quick succes
sion, Smith appearing quite unable to
stop them. Then the referee awarded a
penalty kick to the Occidentals, which

The star game of association foot
ball for this season was played yester
day on the cricket grounds at Webster
street, Alameda. between the Vampire
and Independent elevens. It ended in
a tic, each team scoring one goal.
The kick-off took place shortly after
2:30 p. m., and from the first the play
was fast and furious. Arthur Robinson
officiated as referee and gave general
satisfaction by his clean, prompt decis
ions. In a few minutes after play be
gan the Independents, defending the
west goal, got a corner kick, but no
score resulted, the ball landing in the
net above the goal. A little later the
Vampires had a corner kick, but did
not score. Then Watt rushed the ball
between the posts and the Independ
ents scored a goal, the first that has
been made this season against the
Vampires. Buchly of the Vampires re
ceived a kick on the ankle and was
knocked out for a short time, but soon
resumed play. The first half ended
without further score.
In the second half the Vampires, now
playing with the sun at their backs,
rushed the Independents-' goal and
equalized the score. Fired by their
success, the Vampires made several de
termined attacks on their enemy's
goal, but failed to score. The game
ended in a tie. For the Vampires Sho
well on the right wing, Langdale as
left halfback and Petersen as full
back rendered excellent service. For
the Independents Mechels and the Fay
brothers were conspicuous, and Owens,
center halfback, did useful work, keep
ing his place on the field faithfully.
The teams lined up in the following
positions:

Dies From His Injuries.
Dani6l Murray, who was struck by an
electric car on East street, between
Mission and Howard, on Saturday
night, died at the Central Emergency
Hospital about 6 o'clock yesterday
morning. His body was removed to the
Morgue. George A. Kooken, the motor
man of the car, was arrested and
booked at the City Prison, on a charge
of manslaughter, and was released on
$50 cash bail. Murray was 62 years of
age. a rigger by occupation, and lived
with his family at 12 Federal street
The following table gives the princi
pal data of these ships, and indicates
the wide differences of naval expert
opinions as to what constitutes the
most efficient battle-ship on slightly
differing displacements:

of the Brooklyn, $418,122; j Baltimore,
$334,557; Raleigh, $269,670; Newark
(which is always under repair), $154,
093; Petrel, $135,842; Dixie, $293,782, and
Yankee, $265,174. The last two named
ships are auxiliary cruisers, so
called, purchased during the war with
Spain. The Dixie was bought for $575,
000 and has consumed $423,357 in repairs
In five years. The Yankee's cost was
also $575,000, and has cost $395,629 In re
pairs for the same period. The auxil
iary vessels appear to be more costly
to maintain in running condition than
those of the regular navy, exceptions
being the Indiana, Massachusetts, Tex
as, Raleigh, Newark and Petrel. .
The new floating dock building at
Sparrows Point, Baltimore, to be trans
ported to Cavite, Philippines, has been
insured in London for about $700,000,
or nearly three-quarters of its value.
The Havana floating dock, located at
Pensacola, is insured in American com
panies for $300,000.
Circulars governing the bidding for
two 13,000-ton battle-ships, to be named
Idaho and Mississippi, have been issued
by the Navy Department and contracts
for these ships should be awarded in
about three months. There was great
reluctance on the part of the board of
construction to comply with the act
of Congress which limited the size of
these two vessels, it being contended
that they were too small to carry the
requisite armament and protection
which battle-ships ought to have. In
the designs as finally approved speed
has been sacrificed in order to carry a
disproportionate battery, i Other naval
powers have a number of medium sized
battle-ships built or under construction
since 1898. Germany is building five
of 12,991 tons (13,200 metric tons), Italy
five, ranging from 12,400 tons to 13,361
tons, and Russia has the Cesarovitch
of 13,110 tons, recently built in France,
besides four others of 12,480 tons to
12,700 tons.
Patria is under construction, and four
more, differing only slightly In arma-
Six submarine boats are to be built
for t^e French navy after the plans
of Naval Engineer Maugan. They will
be the largest yet built, displacing 450
tons when submerged, and to have a
surface speed of twelve knots.
Commander Henry Morrell has
made 'a preliminary report to the Navy
Department on the explosion "of the
naval magazine on Iona Island, No
vember 4, which differs materially from
the first statement made. Morrell's re
port states that when the first explo
sion occurred two gunners, Fries and
Kuhlwein, were thrown down and in
jured about the head. The flre alarm
was sounded, but only four men- of the
yard force responded, namely; F. Dan
ielson, John W. Wilde, Frederick Gorat
and Alvah J. Jochumsen. These men,
with Captain Magee, fought the fire and
are deserving of praise. On the other
hand none of the laborers nor the ma
rine guard rendered any assistance, a
corporal and a sergeant have r mysteri
ously disappeared and none of the nine
privates made their appearance when
they were wanted until the flro was un
der control and all danger had passed.
The expenditure for ordnance stores
in the United States navy, while very
large, is one of the outlays of the naval
establishment that will not be be
grudged. Liberal allowance should be
made for target practice, as without
skill and experience in serving the guns
the ships are of little value in time of
war. The total cost of ordnance stores
expended on ships during 1902-03 was
only $813,462. against $1,078,246 for the
preceding year. *It is estimated that
the cost of target practice will be about
$1,366,000 during 1903-04, and that when
all the battle-ships now under construc
tion are in commission the cost will
reach $2,690,000 annually. The target
practice during the past summer at
tracted considerable attention, chiefly
because of the many good records
made, and the results appear to have
warranted the expenditures of the
previous Â¦ year by a marked Improve
ment in the gunnery.
The seven battle-ships which in 1901-

with the naval programme of 1900.
ordnance stores were: Alabama, $78,
273; Kearsarge, $77,971; Massachusetts.
$70,360; Wisconsin, 568,332; Iowa. $40,
780; Kentucky, $31,014, and the Illinois,
$28,878. During 1902-03 the Alabama
expended only $38,459; Kearsarge, $27.
338; Massachusetts, $31,765; .'Wisconsin,
$6579; Iowa, $43,289; Kentucky, $42,724,
and the Illinois, $33*202. Gunnery and
torpedo practice of the torpedo fleet
seems to have been neglected, for while
there were 52 torpedo vessels and sub
marine boats afloat in 1902-03, only $79,
675 was expended in ordnance stores,
against $192,610 in' 1901-02, when there
were only 33 torpedo crafts afloat.
The repairs to ships and their equip
age during 1902-03 amounted to $5,695,
643, against $5,802,102 for the preceding
year. The costliest repairs were those

An exciting ocean race of about 1200
miles between the British cruisers Me
dea and Medusa ended November 9, the
Medusa winning by'three minutes. The
race from Gibraltar to Eddvstone was
made to determine the relative merits
of water tube boilers, the Medea being
fitted with Yarrow boilers and the Me
dusa with the Durr type, which is ex
tensively used in the German navy.
The Medusa gained slightly in the start
and increased her lead to nine miles
owing to failure of the fans on the
Medea, but after repairs had been made
the Medea closed the gap within three
quarters of a mile. The greatest ex
citement prevailed on both vessels, es
pecially in the boiler-room, and even
the officers assisted in stoking and
passing of coal. The slight difference
in the time made is too insignificant to
determine which boiler is tha best, but
the coal burned and the condition of
the two types after this run will set
tle the question of merit between the
British and German types.
Competitive trials have been in prog
ress for several months between the
Medea and Medusa to ascertain the rel
ative economy of the Durr and Tar
row boilers and up to the recent race
between the two ships the preference
was markedly in favor of the Yarrow
type. It is claimed that the coal con
sumption of the Durr boiler is 25 per
cent greater than that of the English
boiler and, acting upon this showing,
the admiralty has decided to place Yar
row boilers to the extent of four-fifth
power in the four armored cruisers of
13,550 tons and 23,500 horse-power,
which are being built. The remaining
one-fifth power will be supplied by the
old-style cylindrical boilers which have
the sole merit of being economical when
used for all purposes except that of
steaming with speed.

The King of Italy has appointed a
committee to investigate the affairs of
the naval establishment against which
serious charges of maladministration
were recently made. The committee
consists of five senators, eight depu
ties and four expert officials, and is em
powered to scrutinize the department
bureaus, ships and dockyards and re
port their findings. The first sitting of
the committee began October 21 and the
investigation will occupy several
months. The Duke of Genoa was Min
ister of Marine during the period In
which the alleged faulty management
of naval affairs prevailed.
The Russian admiralty has issued or
ders requiring all midshipmen to attend
the special officers' classes, and repeat
ed failure to pass the examinations will
result in removal from the fighting fleet
and relegation to service on transports.
Efforts are also being made to raise the
standard of the petty officers' class by
increased training ana theoretical
knowledge. To stimulate competition
in gunnery practice the Czar offers val
uable prizes, gold watches with the Im
perial arms, and money, and there is
already a marked Improvement in all
the squadrons as a result of this offer
of prizes.

at tar?<u practice in Mapdalena Bay. The
Mohican intended to remain there until
Fhr Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's steamer Curacao arrived in port
late yesterday afternoon. Sho made the
round trip to Guaymas and return in
twenty-two days.
From Mazatlan she brings $175,000 of

Curacao Arrives
While th* waters of the bay were ev
erything that could bo calm and peace
ful yesterday, the bar was rough and
choppy and outside the Heads a heavy
sea was petting in toward shore. The
sea dashed completely over the seal
rock* and the great waves as they
ftru'k filled the afr with fij-ing ppray.
off thp heads were some dozen lumber
i^.Â«ols bound in. but they were all
afraid of the bar and several of them
pt""d out to sea. Inside were two big
Ehlpa and several schooners lying at an
<h<>r. waiting to cross out. from pres
ent indications the bar v.JH bÂ«- smooth
to-day and navigation will b? again re-
Fumed.
A cry for help went up, and Greg
gains, who was on the boulevard,
v hipped up his horse and reached the
srene in a short time. Driving the ani
mal into the surf he reached Stall.
After lifting the lad to his feet he hur
ried to Allen, who was farther out and
pitching about on the surface of the
water. Wave after wave dashed against
the policeman's mount before he was
able to come within reach of the boy.
Finally he dismounted, and leaving his
horse standing braced himself in the
sand and caught the limp form of the
lad as it was being carried out on a
receding wave. He reached dry ground
drenched and exhausted and took the
boy to the Seal Rock House, where he
was cared for and resuscitated. His
parents were telephoned for and they
took the lad home.
There was an unusually heavy sea
yesterday afternoon and monster
breakers broke on the shore. The two
youngsters were playing on the sand
and running ahead of the waves as they
came in. A large breaker finally took
them unawares, and when it receded
took both off their feet.
Mounted Policeman M. J. Greggalns,
at the risk of his own life, rescued two
9-year-old boys from the surf near the
Olympic Salt Water Company's pier
yesterday afternoon. The pair of
youngstersâ Walter Allen, son of Albert
Allen, a plumber, residing at 1151 Mis
sion street, and Cecil Stall, living at 69
Minna Ftreet â had been caught by a
breaker and were being pitched about
when the brave officer came to their
assiptancp. Stall was landed without
much difficulty, but Allen was nearly
drowned before he could be dragged
to shore.

%v? |^B/jKy,5 45^1 3 Â¦ 4 Hb3>jiO| m Â«jt( - v! *^^ t"I don't believe," remarked Mr.
Thompson, "that those boys were alone
in their crooked work. In fact, I have
pretty good evidence, which I am not
at liberty to disclose, that they were
simply used as' tools by a shrewdly or
ganized gang of thieves whose head
quarters are on Second street, in this
city. It is my impression that when the
boys came here they were honest and
fell into the clutches of the gang to
whom I have alluded. Goldstein, I
could almost swear, was not a thief
when he first came to our house. I am
less positive as to McKlniry*s honesty
at that time, because he was older and
more experienced than his companion,
but I accepted him as an ambitious
young student."
The young men never did a thins to arouse
my suspicion as. to their honesty. They were
always up In the morning about 7 o'clock and
went riding on their bfcycles. . About 10 or 11
they returned, had a bath, and usually epent
the afternoon In their room, reading. About 6
o'clock they would again start out on their
wheels, and they never stayed out . later than
10. My husband and I often congratulated
ourselves on having such well-behaved boys
occupying- our spare room. .
Mrs. Thompson, when seen at her
home in this, city last evening, said:
Little Robert Morgan, son of Mrs.
George W. Morgan, residing at 2326
College avenue, Berkeley, declares that
Goldstein is the burglar who ransacked
that residence last Wednesday after
noon. "I saw the man pull off a false
beard as he* went out of the door," the
boy says. ,
â¢Young Goldstein's mother married
Greiner several years ago. Greiner is
a painter* in Los Angeles. Besides the
girl, Annie, there is a boy younger than
the* dead man. Â¦ â¢*.
IMPRESSED MRS. THOMPSON.
McKiniry, according to the police de
scription, is 23 years old, five feet ten or
eleven inches tall, 155 pounds in weight,
slender, of dark, sallow complexion, has
large dark blue eyes, dark brown hair,
square jaw. heavy eyebrows and regu
lar features. Two of his upper front
teeth are slightly crooked and he has
close gold fillings in point of several
teeth.
"" "We have Â¦ found nothing in the . effects of
either Goldstein or of McKiniry to show that
either of them was connected with the Crellin
or Bannan burglaries. We did find enough to
show- that these â¢ men are crooks, bad ones,
and ready for anything. There was not much
Jewelry in the trunks.
matters that are now very important. Amom
them was a crucible, plaster of Paris mold,
such as are used for gold melting. Detective
Quigley of Oakland and Detective- Tom Â¦ Cole
man or San Francisco got this stuff yesterdaj
It looks to me as If the men had used this and
other material to melt gold jewelry In and to
do that sort of work. In fact we are quite
sure of it now. Shortly after they lelt, my
mother took down the curtains in the room
McKiniry occupied to wash them. She had
an awful time with them and it must have
been caused by the chemicals used in manipu
lating the gold. ;Â¦".Â¦Â¦
It was about a week ago that the first >""â¢,
mation of anything wrong came to us. De
tectives called at the house and made . inquiry
about- our former roomers. I think it was in ,
connection with the street car holdups or the
holdups in the park. I did not learn why the
detectives desired to know about the men, nor
what had occurred to cause suspicion to be
cast upon them. As soon as I read about tne
Smith shooting in Oakland I went at once
to the police, having recognized the name of
Goldstein. I gave the detectives a complete
statement of my knowledge of the men.
But, strangely enouffh, nothing was done to
watch our house, so far aa I know, although
two detectives, as -I said, came during tne
afternoon, ar.d I turned over the roomers
mail to them. Last evening two other men
called. One of them stepped up to the door
when my mother or>ened it and asked her tor
mail that might have come there for Gold
stein or McKiniry. My mother went to the
hall stand and looked, but found nothing. Re
turning to the door she reported that to tne
caller. Juet as I stepped out to see whoxwas
there, the second man stuck his head around
the corner of ths entrance post and saw me.
Both of them quickly left and disappeared be
fore I had at chance to eet a fair glimpse at
them. Their actions were not right and there
is. not a bit of doubt In my mind that they
came direct lrom McKiniry. How could two
strangers know that mail was coming to that
house unless McKiniry or some one close to
him bad told them?
THINKS "GANG" EXISTED.
That call for mail convinces me that there
were more than two concerned In these rob
beries-. I feel satisfied that McKiniry was one
of an organized gang of skillful thieves, that
he took Goldstein Into his same and had in
tended to make a criminal of him.
During their stay at the Steadman
residence in Oakland McKiniry took
the. lead in establishing himself in the
family's good graces. It was a repetition
of the Thompson story in practically
every detail. Not until after the
shooting and the identification of Gold
stein's body by Ross Steadman as that
of one of the roomers was the truth
revealed. Goldstein and McKInlry's
trunks are in the possession of the po
lice. So is a note found yesterday at
the young men's rooms, reading as fol
lows:
"Will be back in course of a week.
THE BOYS.
v "If we send any notice, follow in
structions."
On the face of it the note is evidence
that more than one man was left to
take an interest in the pair of well
armed night prowlers. That note was
left at the Steadman house after Fri
day night's shooting. Yet the police
did not act until too late on the knowl
edge that McKiniry or any of his gang
had been near the Steadman place.
Chief of Police Hodgkins made this
statement to-night:
MOTHER AXD THE SISTER OF THE YOUTHFUL. BUKTILAR WHO WAS SLAIN BY BRAVE POLICEMAN
SMITH. AND THE HOUSE IN THIS CITY WHERE THE YOUNG CRIMINAL AND HIS PAL ROOMED FOR
A TIME WITH ATTORNEY THOMPSON AND HIS MOTHER.
OAKLAND, Nov. 29.â The identifica
tion of the young burglar wtfb was shot
and killed Friday night at Fourteenth
and Jackson streets by Policeman
James H. Smith, who in turn was killed
by the dead burglar's pal. is complete.
The name of the criminal whose body
lies on the Morgue slab was Frank J.
Goldstein. He was 19 years of age and
the son of Mrs. K. Greiner of 1338 East
Eighth street, Los Angeles.
Joseph McKiniry, a carpenter, .23
years old, lately from Los Angeles, but
Â¦whose he me is in Toledo, Ohio, was the
companion of Goldstein and is the man
for whom the police are searching as
the murderer of the dead policeman.
With the identity of both men thor
oughly established and their move
ments from Los Angeles to San Fran
cisco, thence to Oakland well tracked.
the Oakland Police Department offi
cially confesses through its head, St.
Clair Hodgkins. Chief of Police, that
the fugitive, McKiniry. has outwitted
them at every turn and that now, forty
eight hours after the tragic encounter,

at 204 Turk street. San Francisco. . where we
were rooming. - McKiniry was then working at
his trade of carpenter, j After we went to Los
Angeles mr boy kex>t up his acquaintance with
McKiniry. wrt> visited us several times after
we moved to Los Angeles. Frank had gone to
buslne*e college in San Francisco and . in Los
Argreles. For several . months during this cum
mer Frank was away Â¦ with McKiniry. and the
last time I saw my boy was In September,
when he left for San Francisco, as I supposed,
to go to college and learn shorthand aad to
Hodgkins knew that McKiniry and
Goldstein had apartments at Mrs. W.
E. Steadman's residence, 1362 Grove
street, yet a note of warning was left
there, presumably by McKiniry, after
the city was aroused by the shooting of
Smith and the Buspected burglar.
. Identification of young Goldstein was
made this morning by his mother and
sister, who arrived at 11 o'clock and
were . escorted to the morgue by de
tectives.
The police had. learned the mother's
address from letters found in the dead
man's! clothing,, and Mrs. Greiner was
advised at once to. come to Oakland.
Broken In spirit, the sorrow-laden pa
rent acknowledged before the police

form on the marble slab was that of
her sonâ the' boy she had believed was
working honestly In San Francisco and
attending a school to complete his edu
cation. To the detectives she- gave fur
ther corroboratlon of the facts they had
gleaned from the mall matter, of which
they, have possession. Some of it was
taken from Goldstein's body and some
of it was turned over to the San Fran
cisco police yesterday by : Attorney
Thompson. Mrs- Greiner detailed at
some length the knowledge of Kiniry'a
association with her son for two years
after they met, first at a common meal
table! In a lodging-house at ;204 Turk
street, San Francisco. This was the
Goldsteins' home before they departed
for Los Angeles two years ago.
It was In September that the pair left
Los Angeles. They went to San Fran-;
dsco. but made] trips. It is believed, \ to
Vallejo and Sacramento. On October 1
they appeared at the Thompson resi
dence, remaining there until November
16 and going then directly to the Stead
man residence in this city.' In her nar
rative to the police to-day Mrs. Greiner
said: *V- ,*;- â¢

The police knew yesterday that for
six weeks after they arrived in San
Francisco from Los Angeles, Goldstein
and. McKiniry occupied rooms at 1919
Oak street, San Francisco, the residence
of W. J. Thompson, an attorney. Chief
of Police Hodgkins was advised that
this had been the home of these men all
o/ that time, yet last night two men
called at that residence for Goldstein's
mail and no detectives wera. there to
apprehend the strangers. That these
mysterious visitors undoubtedly were
in touch ' with McKiniry is the opinion
of Thampson, who manifested great
surprise that no policemen were on
hand.

the fact that the police have had full
knowledge of the haunts of these men.

' McKiniry, without any doubt, had a strong
control , over the younger man ' and did ; not

that 'he is the responsible: party for Goldstein's

slightest question was # ralsed.
What impelled them to suddenly move away
I do not know. It' might have been that they
were engaged in thievery and feared detection.
Subsequent events seem - to point ; that way.
But McKiniry told my mother that he intend
ed to move to Oakland, because it was near the
State 1 University that Goldstein was "going, to
attend. That was a fair enough: explanation.
The day they moved McKiniry remained at the
rooms and stayed there until their , belongings

That Goldstein and McKiniry 'were
not alone in the thievery . that they
might have accomplished is the theory
of Attorney Thompson.! After identify
ing the body at the Morgue as that of
one of his roomers Thompson gave a
lengthy narrative of his* relations with
the pair. He said:
Mrs. Greiner had written frequently
to her boy, but the only address she
knew, was that of the Oak-street house
in San Francisco.
