SACRAMENTO, Oct. 7.â Chris Evans,
the notorious bandit, declares that in
killing people and holding up the trains
of the Southern Pacific he was guilty of
errors of the head rather than the heart.
In applying to Governor Pardee to-day
for recommendation for a parole Evans
advanced this claim, adding that he had
been confined in Folsom prison for nine
years now; that he has been an exemplary
prisoner, and is in bad health. The Gov
ernor received the letter while preparing
to go to Chico to attend a meeting of the
Normal School Trustees, and took no ac
tion upon it. Evans further represented
in the letter to the Governor that he had
a letter from the Fresno Judge who sent
him to prison for life favoring his appli
cation for parole; another from the Dis
trict Attorney who prosecuted him. Evans
further claims that a majority of the
Jurors who convicted him also expressed
themselves willing that he should be lib
erated on promise of good behavior.
Evans artlessly informed the Governor
that he did not pretend to be an innocent
man, admitting that if innocent he would
not be languishing behind prison bars.
He added that he sympathized. with the
victims of corporate injustice and felt
that his mistakes were those of the head
raher than of heart.
The charge upon which Evans is con
fined In the penitentiary is murder. The
Governor has no power to grant a parole,
but Evans desires him to say a v good. word
to the prison directors ' in his behalf.

Slater shortly afterward accidentally
shot himself through the pelvis while at

Ihmmel was sent to the dungeon and
is there to-night. As a result of the in
vFtipation George Jones. who has had
charge of the fncorrigible-s for many
years, has resigned.
Warden Tompkins said to-night: "No,
I did not discharge Jones. He had been
tt the prison many years, eo I gave him
a change by transferring him to the Jute
mill detail. 1 severely criticised him for
net discovering Hammers work, and in
fact there is no excuse for it. The scis
sors should not have gone unfound and
how it was that the cutting in the floor
was not seen I cannot conceive. Jones
took exception to my criticism and quit.
That's a!,."
â¢"I started in to work on vr.y floor," said
Hamroel. "the first part of June. All I
had wa8 the piece of scissors and nail,
end of course it was slow work. I was
not interrupted and expected to be able
to lift the n'.ate In a 5hort time. Then I
would go through the floor in the room
below (the second story of the unused
furniture factory). There I was going to
procure a piece of iron hoop and a piece
cf rope. On a foggy night I would go to
the end of the building, which is only
ebout twenty feet from the wall, throw
the hoop to hook on the top railing on the
wall, draw the rope taut and climb hand
over hand over the wall. The piec*s of
Fdssors W2S given me by a man going out
â¢ if the Incorrigible coll. When I could not
work I secreted the tools in a niche in
xny cell. I will not say whether there was
any one else In the tcbtftaj or not."
Another incorrigible reported to the
ir::trd that lie often heard noise in one
cf tbe other cells. Warden Tompkins was
notified. The strictest watch was kept,
and finally the noise was located in Ham
mers cell. The cell was searched, and the
cut plates were found. Hammel was in
terrogated and finally confessed to War
den Tompkins that he had been working
on the plate for several months. He also
divulged a most novel scheme of escape.

During V.'arden Aguirre's regime a tun

Fetrcr. It had bÂ«en completed for about
.fifty fort out. Only ten feet separated the
men from liberty when Hammel and an
cther convict were discovered coming out
cf the tunnel. At that time Hammel con
fessed that about fifteen desperate in
mates were in the plot, but it was ut
terly impossible to compel him to divulge
the natres of his confederate?. ' He was
sentenced to ten months' solitary confine
ment in the incorrigible cells for that
r.ffair. Although under constant guard
h? worked like a beaver once more to
â¢Ci'-n his liberty. All the tools he had to

SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Oct. 7.â An
Â©utbreak from San Quentin has been nar
Â¦rowly averted. Just how far the plot
reached is not yet known, nor is It known
how many prisoners were in the con
ppiracy. The steol flooring in on*? of the
incorrigible eeiis was almost cut through
Tor a ?pace olg-hteen inches square. The
plate was three-eighths of an Inch thick
and three sides of the square had been
cut, while three-quarters of the fourth
side was almost sawed through.
The attempted jail delivery was discov

kins and the prison attaches, who knew
of the affair, kept th* matter secret in
the hoD"s of finding out the details of
the plot. As is a prison custom, the con
victs shield each other, and thus far only
one has confessed. George Hammel. who
is serving twenty-five years in the prison,

Dismissal of . Re

Commissioner Continues the
Examination Until
October 13."
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â The examination
of George W. Beavers on the first Wash
ington indictment, charging him with
complicity in an alleged conspiracy with
the Postal Device and Improvement Com
pany of California, was commenced to
â¢day before United States Commissioner
Hitchcock. Beavers was not present, be
ing represented by counsel.
The certified copy of the indictment hav
ing already been offered in evidence by
the prosecution and proof of the identity
of the defendant being 1 waived by his
counsel, the prosecution informed the de
fense that It- considered this, under Com
missioner Hitchcock's ruling, . a prlma
facie "case 'and,* that it "expected "to put
In no r further, evidence; on the removal
proceedings on this Indictment.
The defense called to the witness stand
PostofSce Inspector Weylahd, who signed
â¢the complaint against Beavers. The wit
ness was not allowed to say whether he
knew of any contract or agreement be
tween George W. Beavers. August "W.
Machen, James ,W. Erwln and the Postal
Device and Improvement Company where
in the three men named agreed to secure
for the company the exclusive right to
furnish the devices made by them to the
Postal Department and at prices higher
than -those paid in the regular market,
that being the basis of the offense
charged against the ; Indicted postal offi
cials. The witness said he had never
seen the contract between the Postal De
partment and the Postal Device and Im
provement Company, but had seen orders
from the Government to the company and
acceptances of them by the company.
Beavers' counsel then moved to dismiss
the removal charges against his client
on the ground that the certified copy of
the indictment did not state facts suffi
cient to constitute a crime: that it was
void because a previous action of re
moval had been instituted in this district;
that the witnesses before the Federal
Grand Jury in Washington had not been
called by the prosecution and for other
reasons. The motion was denied.
Postoffice Inspector Birdseye testified in
a similar fashion. Counsel for Beavers
said he proposed to show that neither
the witness nor any of the others so
named could have given the legal evi
dence before the Federal Grand Jury in
Washington upon which the indictment
was found.
"If we can snow you that none of the
witnesses were compelled to swear to
these facts, Mr. Commissioner," said
Beavers' counsel, "I do not see ho% you
can hold this accused for removal."
Assistant District Attorney Baldwin in
sisted that the Commis'sloner's court was
no tribunal to question the sufficiency of
the indictment. The Commissioner said
he was not prepared to rule upon that
point and an adjournment was taken un
til the ,13th inst., leaving Inspector Birds
eye still on the stand, his testimony .un
completed.

WIDEWATER, Va., Oct. 7. -The sixty
foot, Bteel-built flying machine, the cli
max of years of exhaustive study in the
efforts of Professor Samuel F. Lang'.ey.
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
to solve the problem of mechanical flight
in mid-air, was launched to-day, and the
experiment, carefully planned and delayed
for months, proved a complete failure.
The Immense airship si>ed rapidly alon^
its seventy-foot track, was carried by it*
own momentum for 100 yards and then
fell gradually into the Potomac River,
whence it emerged a total wreck. Profes
sor Charles 11 Manley. who has been
Professor Langley' s chief assistant In thÂ«
work preliminary to the attempted fllguU
made the ascent In the aerodrome and es
caped with a ducking.
At no time was there any semblance of
flight, the Initial, momentum, the lightness
of the machine and the sustaining: sur
face of the wings furnishing the condi
tions which account for the 100-yard tran
sit of the alrbird from its, sixty-foot ele
vation to the water. An official statement
made after the test admitted that th* ex
periment was unsuccessful, but asserted
confidence in the ultimate success of th*
Invention.
FAILURE AT ONCE APPARENT.
â¢ The launching took place at 12:15 o'clock
this afternoon from the superstructure
of the houseboat moored in the Potomac
River, two miles from this place. Fifteen
minutes before that everything was
cleared for action. Professor Manley was
clad in his aeronautical suit of white
duck trousers and cork-lined jacket.
Professor Langley did not witness the
failure of hfs machine to-day, but re
mained In "Washington." where 4 he awaited
the result. When all was ready Professor
Manley tcck his place in the navigator's
car, which T\as situated close to the gaso

weigh-iÂ«i 200 pounds, and was designed to
generate approximately twenty-seven,
horsepower. Long rods connected with
the propeller, whose blades were a bo it
three feet long. Professor Manley started
the motor, which worked well, the revo
lutions reaching 1200 a minute. The big
machine moved easily along the seventy
foot track In the launching apparatus and
took the air fairly well. A five-mile breeze
was blowing, and for a moment the ma
chine stood up well, but its failure wr.s
immediately apparent. It turned gradual
ly downward. "
EXPEBIHENT IN BALANCING.
Just before the machine struck the wa
ter Professor Manley shut off his motor,
which had worked admirably at the out
set. The machine disappeared beneath
the waves, but only momentarily. TTia
five conical-shaped floats which had been
distributed about the machine to avert it*
sinking, performed their functions well,
and the bridge of the machine almost tr.>
mediately reappeared above the water. It
was a moment of anxiety for the safety
of the navigator, but fears were Instantly
relieved as his head emerged above tTla
surface. He had sustained no Injury. Ills
face reflected his disappointment at tha
result. He climbed Into a rowboat whVb,
had been kept close at hand and was con
veyed to the deck of the tug BartholJL
There he exchanged his dripping clothes
for dry garments. Later Professor Man
ley gave out the following statement to>
the newspapers:
"It must be understood tha. the test to
day was entirely an experiment and tha
first of Its kind ever made. The experi
ment was unsuccessful. The balancing
upon which depends the success of ths
flight was based upon the tests of the
models and proved to be incorrect, but
only an actual trial of t..e full-sized ma
chine itself could determine this. My
confidence in future success of the work
is unchanged. I can give you no other
information. I shall make a formal re
port to Secretary Langley."
The work of removing the wreck was
immediately begun and fcy 2 o'clock tha
disabled machine had been put away ia
the interior of the houseboat.

Y ONDQN; Oct. 8. â The correspondent of the Daily Mail at Kobe, Japan, telegraphs that Baron von Rosen on October 4 presented a note to the Japanese Govern-
M ment contending that Japan had no right to interfere in the. question of the evacuation. of Manchuria, which solely concerned Russia and China. The note further
proposed the partition of Korea, and suggested that Japan take the southern half and Russia the northern provinces. The note was discussed by a council of
Ministers on October 5, and Marquis Yamagata, command er-^i-chicf of the army, had consultations zvith the Ministers of War and Marine. The Japanese Govern
ment, adds the correspondent, then sent a reply to Baron von Rosen rejecting the Russian proposal. A crisis impossible at any moment.

Exactly, what Russia's new : demands. upon China are no official of the State
Department is prepared to say, but the belief is strong that. they are prac
tically the same as "those reported : from Peking last-, spring and disavowed by
the Â¦ Russian Foreign Office. It was , said to-nighti on | the highest authority Â¦ that
this Government Â¦ had reason, to believe .that Russia was insisting on the very
demands which '.Count 'Lamsdorf assured . Embassador" McCormlck- had never
been presented, and - which Count Casslni, the \ Russian Embassador ,. told Secre
tary, Hay were'merely. presented as" a basis of 'negotiations.
FOKOHAMA, Oct. 7.â According to information received here, the Russian
Minister at Peking, M. Lessar, has informed the Chinese Foreign Of
fice that Russia will never evacuate Manchuria unless her latest de
mands are gTanted. China, it is added, has appealed to the Japanese
Minister, M. Ouchida, for Japanese assistance.
The Japanese residents of Jef-Wie-Ju have filed a petition with- the Foreign
Office at Tokio asking that a Japanese warship and troops be sent to protect
their interests, in view of the menacing attitude of Russia. The reply of Japan
is not yet known.
The town of Jef-Wle-Ju Is probably Wiju, a Korean town near the estuary
of the Amanok, on '.the frontier of China, and a great depot for overland trade
with that country.
The press, which reported the fortification by Russia of Yongampho, on the
Korean bank of , 5 the Yalu River, considers this action as a possible ca3us belli,
as being an infringement of Korean integrity. The report, however, is not con
firmed officially.
The temporary Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs has been relieved at his
own request. 1
Baron von Rosen, -the Russian Minister to Japan, had another conference
with Baron Komura, the. Japanese. Foreign Minister, yesterday. The Japanese
Premier, Viscount Katsura, had an audience with the Emperor, the same day.
It is now feared that the promised concessions on the part of Russia are insuf
ficient to offset her continuous menace to Korea, nor Is the Chinese-Japanese
commercial treaty, to be signed on October 8, deemed adequate' to compensate
for permanent Russian occupation. .
A rumor current to-night says that definite Russian demands concerning
Manchuria and Korea have been" presented to Japan by Baron von Rosen.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7.- Neither the high officials of the department nor the
Japanese Minister. Takahira. expressed much surprise when shown to-night's
press report from Yokonama that the Russian Minister at Peking had noti
fied the Chinese Government that Russia would never evacuate Manchuria un
til her latest demands wefe granted.
Secretary Hay, believes that the American-Chinese commercial treaty will
be signed at Shanghai to-morrow and that thereby the ports of Mowkden
and Antung wlir be opened to the 'world's commerce. -The United States' po
sition, unless this development prevents the, signing .of the American commer
vcial treaty to-morrow, will be-thatit has gained from Russia what it sought
by the advocacy â¢' of the "open door" and will not feel called upon to Interfere
in a question so essentially Russian-Chinese as the continued occupation of Chi

High officials of the State Department tb-nlght, however, said ; that the re
fusal by Russia to evacuate Manchuria to-morrow, the date long ago set. would
show Russia, to be absolutely regardless cf^the promise "she made~ to China and

Larson then missed $299 in bank notes

of the crowd, being drunk and feeling
themselves Incapable of giving him a fair

of this city is run by rule. There are certain
rules for this purpose, and it has been my

rules were, to find out how the business of
the city and county of San Francisco should

BODY OF MURDERED
SAILOR IS IDENTIFIED
Captain of the Scottish Moors Recog
nizes the Deceased as a Mem
" ber of His Crew.'
SAN DIEGO, Oct. 7.â Investigation into
the cause of death of the sailor found
floating in the bay last night indicates
quite clearly that he was the victim of
foul, play. Ho was a sailor from the
British ship Scottish Moors and was
identified by Captain Todford as Alexan
der Jarvenberg. Jarvenberg left the ves
sel Tuesday night of last week, became
drunk and engaged in a brawl in a water
front saloon. Later in the evening he
returned to the wharf and went aboard
the schooner. Bertha Dolbeer. The
watchman aboard the Scottish Moors
stated at the inquest to-night that he
heard voices on the wharf Saying that
they would, "get him when he returned,"
or something to that effect. The watch
man did not know of whom they were
speaking and paid no attention to the
remarks. Then all was quiet and Jarven-

slowly on the street with the band ahead,
and not !n the wagon, (I>aushter.) Is there
peace? How have they effected peace? What
harmony exists among them? G-j back two
monthsâ I want you, my Republican friends,
to remember this thing; I am talklns to you;
I want you to recall the history of your.'party
for the i>ast- two months in this city and see
if you are i>roud of It. A coterie of men
gathered themselves together and determined
that they would administer the affairs of the
city and county of San Francisco. They
barred out th* men who had been iiromlnent
In the conduct of Republican affairs and Re
publican nolltics. The head of a great cor
poration !n this' city went with hit hat in
hip hand from cort>oration to corporation in
the city and county of Sar. Francisco begging
for money for the conduct of the Republican
l'rirr.cries and he gained $30,000; and with
tliose $30. COO that combination of seven men
were ?ble to canture the Republican party of
tho city and county of San Francisco, and
they barred out forty-eight hundred of their,
own men. That wns the first thin* they did.
They threw overboard a (Treat body Of their
people. Anil then what did they Uo? They
met. they held their . convention, they per
mitted one of their men to sit there In that
convention whom they knew and whem every
one of them knew was not loyal to tliem. They
permitted him to have his share In the putting
up of a Board of Supervisors. In the nomina
tion of an entire ticket, and then that manâ
that man himself â went down Into the old
Republican chip and scuttled It and came up
and took p. jump overboard Into "a lonfr.
low, rakish craft," as the school bocks used
to say, the novels of my early days, and then
he said, "I ask thirty days' leave of ab
sence." (Laughter.) And then the men sink
ing upon -the Republican ship told him that
he must walk the Dlnnk when he was miles
away. You tell me that those mtn acted In
pood faith In the Republican convention. You
tell me that the Republican party In this city
acts In rood faith. . Why there is one answer
to that one which Is conclusive: Look at their
Board of Supervisors. r>o you think that those
men want good Rovernment? Is It possible that
there is any man within the sound cf my voice
who believes that the Republican party stands
for good government \ n thU city under â¢ Its
present management, when they would have
the audacity to put up such a "> Board of Su
pervisors as that which has been presented?
well that er.ds Wells." (Laughter.) If you
aro Mr. de Young's business man you are the
right kind cf a busir.efs man: but if you are
net Mr. <3e Ycunj's kind of a buslne?a man,
then, as he said two years ago, even a Demo
cratic lawyer Is good enough for Mayor.
Two-Year-Old Child Strays Awaj;
From Home and Is Not Found
Until Daylight.
PETALUMA, Oct. 7.â Wandering In a
wild, rough country all night and suffer
ing from exposure was the experience
of a 2-year-old child, the daughter of P.
Buzzinl. The child was missed from hums
Tuesday night and the parents after a
fruitless search called for help. The n!ght
was dark and though the search was kept
up It was not until dawn broke that the
little one was found. At daybreak Al
bert Puckett found the child safe and
sound, but wet to the skin, wading in a
spring oh the Buzzini ranch, in water
deep enpugh to have drowned her had she
fallen. It Is feared that serious results
may follow the child's exposure on the
bleak mountain top.

BABE WANDEBS ALL NIGHT
ON BLEAK MOUNTAIN TOP
In St. Lou If they had a worklr.itman run
things, a man named Butler, who has now
been convicted of a felony and Is threatened
with a term In the penitentiary. Mr. Butler
is a blacksmith, and a good blacksmith, and
a boss business man. > Mr. Butlir dealt with
the Board of Supervisors. He did not go about
corrupting Civil Service Commissioners, that
they might sell papers. He would think very
little indeed of selling: a horse in a fire de
partment, much less a colt to a frlc-nd. But
Mr. Butler knew that there were men who
wanted a franchise for a street railroad and
so he said, "I have a block of Supervisors'
votes: what are you willing to give?" And
they said so much soot cash. He accepted
the offer, the money was put up In the bank;
and then that Mayorâ I don't know how they
ever came to elect such a Mayor as that In
St. Louis â that Mayor vetoed the ordinance.
And then the company said, "Why. see here,
we can't' pay you, you didn't daliver the
goods." But, he said, "I delivered the votes,
didn't I? You didn't contract for the Mayor,
you only contracted for the Board of Super
visors." And somebody some day may say
that here. Now, what happened? They elected
a young fellow as fresh from private life
aa I was five years .ago, as innoccnt-of public
service and as Innocent of politic* as I was
then. That younsr man has made a grand, a
glorious, a national name for â¢ himself. You
recognize It when I say It, for seme day I
hope myself to vote for Folk for President
of the United States. Folk heard of this
and^what did he do? He went down and he
clajQbd his hands on the money that was In
the safe deposit vault, under threat of putting
the man In Jail If he didn't let him have it;
and then the cat was out of the bag. Then
the president of the street railway combine
gave the story away. And what has been the
result? For two years you have found one
man after another going to Jail in St. Louis.
Why? Because there was a man named Butler
who 'chose to sell some franchises, which has
not been considered such an outrageous thing
even in the city of San Francisco.
But In Minneapolis they had a man named
Ames who was Mayor of the city. Ames had
been Mayor once and they said he had made
a pretty good kind of a Mayor, and so they
thought they had Just as well elect him again.
And they elected him again. And tnen every
man In the city who could be touched was
touched, every man who could be reached was
reached. The administrative departments were
all brought under subjection to him and to
his control. A system of blaekmalt went .on
which at last attracted the attention of some
of the newspapers, and the people were

and no man In the world knows it better than

that the charter of the city and county of Ban

manhood enough in r â¢ you, unless there is
strength of character enough In you, unless you

that charter of building up the greatest corrupt
political machine that ever has been offered to

calmly for a minute tell you how. Listen to
me patiently now. The details through which
I am going will not perhaps be. rhetorical, but
I want this thing to sink deep Into your hearts,

Hall. (Applause.)
Now. mnybe you think. that I am dreaming
creams, that these things need not come true.
I could give you some Instances were I of a
;mind to. But you know, you who read the
papers, you who have kept track of things, you
know the history of other cities in the United
States. You "know what has happened in St.
Louis; you know what has happened in Min
neapolis; you know what has happened in
Plttsburjj. In Pittsburg they had a business
man's administration. Mr. Chris Magee was
the business man. and Mr. Chris Magce. saw
his opportunities just as clearly as any man
In San Francisco sees opportunities. Mr. Chris
Magee wns a member of a contracting firm,
though hi* name did not appear, and they did
business with the Board of Public Works when
great sums of money were to be expended. Mr.
Chris Magee was a member of a bond Indem
nity company, and they did business with all
the city employes when they went Into office
on the first of the year. Mr. Chris Magee, the
business man, saw that franchises were given
to h!s friends, that money was placed In the
proper banks. Those things are all possible
In San Francisco. - We have had a touch of
them.
There in a Board Of Public Works. Every
man who wishes to put up steps In front of
his house; every man who wishes to alter a
room In his house; every man who wishes to do
the slightest bit of plumbing in his house;
every man who wishes to put up a great
building, and every man who wishes to make
Use of his* property has to go before that
Board of Public Works and get a permit; and
I tell you that every contractor and every
builder, every business man and every prop
erty-owner within tho city and county of Snn
Francisco can be made subject to blackmail by
the Board of Public Works. He can be told:
"You go and get that lawyer, or else you don't
get that permit." (Applause.)
And there Is the Police Commission. Why.
men come to me every day and they tell m*
that they dare not speak their minds; that
they dare not stand up for their rights; that
they dare not exercise the right and privilege
of every American citizen, because they are in
the fear ofÂ» being broken before a Police Com
mission. Should that thing be In the city of
San Francisco? Have pollcemen.no rights as
men? Have saloon-keepers no rights as men?
And then there Is a Board of Health. Wiiy,
I tell you that it is In the power of an ad
ministration within this city to lift the elimi
nation of milk, to lift the examination of meat
and send the disease, nto every household In
this city, and for a consideration. You know
as well as I do, you know what departments
there are; you know how people can be held up.
And what does all this mean, my friends?
It means this: That the city of San Francisco
Is threatened to-day," and threatened in this
campaign by a government ' by. fear; and I
stand here to-night an advocate and am pledged
to substitute for a government of fear a gov
ernment by law. What right has a member of
the Fire Commission In direct contravention
of the law of this city to go into an engine
house and a3k thesft mtn to vote one ticket
rather than another? Why Is it that men who
are In the service of this city feel to-day thut
they are bound down f,or fear that they will be
broken? The government of San Francisco
should not be from the- City Hall outward; it
should be from the people toward the City
ROASTS 8 COMMISSIONERS.
Speaker Insinuates That Various
Boards Are Crooked.
I see men here, old men, men who have
beer, acquainted with the public life of San
Francisco for a cre.it many years, and you
know that the charjfu always was that the
Board of Supervisors was the corrupt 'bÂ«ly.
There was the board on which the newspapers
had their eyes always, wasn't it? They used
to watch each member of the board and his
vote to see if any corporation owned him.
Now the corporations want Supervisors'. Why?
Because they want franchises; because they
want privileges; because they want favors.
They still want Supervisors. But behind the
corporation? there U at the present tlmo ex
isting a conspiracy to seize not only the Su
pervisors, but every administrative board in
the City and county government; and they can
do it by the election not alone of Supervisors,
but ot the Mayor, for he has the appointing
of these administrative boards. They can
make civil service valueless, absolutely worth
less. There ls> not a man within hearing of
my voice, there is not a man at the City Hall

under municipal control, and half under State
control. We had a Board of Police Commis

movable by anybody: we had a Board of
Health appointed by the Governor for a term;
we had then no Board . of Public Works, but
a Superintendent of Streets; we had no Depart

Commission; the Idea had not then entered into
the minds of men that the men in public serv

and of merit alone. But that thlnz was
changed by the charter. Now, what i3 the
result?" ' . -"â¢ .
I want a newer San Francisco. I want a
newer San Francisco that has newer activities,
and newer industries, and newer life, and
newer enthusiasm and newer self-respect. But
I want a San Francisco that has a moral tone
that goes back to that old commandment
'Thou shalt not steal." And I want a San
Francisco that goes back to that oU day when
Christ drove the money changers out of thÂ»
temple. San Francisco does not consist of so
many buildings that are twelve stories high;
San Francisco does not consist of so many
miles of paved streets; San Francisco does not
consist of so many factories and so many mills
and so many street railroads and so many
corporations and so many lawyers. San Fran
cisco my friends consists of 410.000 or there
abouts, of principled, thinking mÂ«n who hav*
hearts and who have heads; mq>i who livÂ»
here and who love their city; .and If 'gan

to be a New Ran Francisco, San Franciscans
must have pride in her; they must be able to
speak of her government with self-respect:
they must be made to feel that the government
of San Francisco Is a government of honor:
they must not be caused to put their heads
eslde In shame when the government of San
Francisco Is spoken of. The New Pan Fran
cisco will come, and that New San Francisco
will be a government by men Mich as you
have here to-night, men who own themselves,
men who think for themselves, men who love
their city men who are loyal to iu Interests,
men who are not demagogues, men who would
not sell any right, men who are determined
upon ons thing, and that Is that tne city of
San Francisco shall be saved from an era of
corruption, that good government' shall pre
vail that good men shall be put In office,
that a square deal shari be given to every
body, that this may be a government ander
the law, a government lust to all. ,'Applause.>
ThlÂ« charter was built upon tha theory that
the people of the city and county of San Fran
cisco were sensible, that It- was possible to
concentrate in the bands of one single man
this great power of administering thÂ« city.
They- said. "We have tried San Francisco; we
know the people here; we know thajthey have
self-respect and honor, and that If men are
placed before them. one. two, three, that they,
with Infallible touch will place their hands upon
the shoulder of an honest man and say to him.
Be our Mayor: that it is not possible for
those men, not possible to the people of this
city at large to go so far wrong aa to create
a man a public officer who will be tile servant
of a political machine, who will be weak, who
will be corrupt, who will not own himself, but
will bow down before some man who Is his
master." And in that belief the people of San
Francisco adopted that charter. Tha preserva
tion of our rights, my friends, depends upon
your votes, and upon your proving that that
was the correct belief. If your vote don't dem
onstrate that now such a political machine will
be built up in the city and county of San Fran.
Cisco as you have never konwn, and aa no city
in the United States now knows. Even Tam
many is guided by heart. There are things
about Tammany that I like, because there - is
humanity and there Is feeling: there. I But a
Republican Tammany, a Republican masquer
ading, not as a Republican, a party of pre
tense, a party of gold bricks, a party that is
false to its honored name, a party that ts
consecrated to things that are- corrupt and are
wrong; a Tammany that has no heart, but has
a pocket.
Don't you for one moment, my friends, think
that the workingmen of San Francisco have no
Interest In the government of thÂ« city of San.
Francisco. I know them. There Is no man
here who knows them better. I have been
charged with appealing to those men for their
votes. There is no doubt that that charge is
true. The time will never come when I shall
stand upon a political platform as a candidate
for office and be unwilling to appeal to the
laboring men of San Francisco or bf the United
State3. But I have never said one word to
those men â and I call you men to witness what
I say â I have never said one word to toe men
at the Union Iron Works when at noon I talked
to them, or to the men at the water front
when at noon I talked to them, or to the men at
the Fulton Iron Works when I talked to them;
not one wofd has come from my lips that
might have not as well been said on the sum
mit of Nob Hill or in the center of the business
districts of San Francisco. * I am Bo coward. I
do mv business openly. I want the- votes of
my fellow-citizens. I go down to talk to thosÂ«
men. and I stand upon a casting on the street
or on Â» barrel, and, my friends. I will do ex
actly the same thing this time; I go down there
to them and I appeal to them on the same
high, marly plane that I appeal to you now.
or as I will appeal to any other audience In
this campaign. And let metell you that there
is quicker response among those men to any
appeal for good government than I find in som*
other audiences ir. San Francisco. (Applause.)
They are not fooled twice. Do you remember
what the old Indian said? "White man fool
Indian once, white man damned smart; whltÂ»
man fool Indian twice. Indian damn fool."
(Laughter.) They know what the Issues in this
campaign are: they know who are flying a flag
that they have no right to; they know what
the workingmen of San Francisco stand for.
And don't you for one moment doubt their loy
alty to this city In this campaign. Don't you
for one moment doubt that they have keen
enough tight to see where their own ultimate
Interests are.
Now my friends, there are two theori?s
upon which the city government of Pan Fran
cisco can be run. One is the theory of favor;
and that Is the theory which bosses wish to
develop. They want to teach you that you
can 'get things only through pull, only through
money; that you must see somebody, outside
of the city government, or Inside of the city
government, or within the political machine
before you can get what you are entitled to.
That Is government by favor; that is gov
ernment by fear; that Is government by in
timidation; that is government by graft: that
Is government by blackmail. But I tell you
It is coming, coming within three short
months, a time when there will be Instituted
in the city of San Francisco the government
by right, when men will be able without go
ing to attorneys, without appealing to soma
potent Influence outside of the city government,
but they may go directly to the Board of
Public Works, to the Police Commission, to
the Health Department, to the Mayor of this
city and ask that something shall be done,
because they have a right to have it done.
I have talked much longer than I expected
to. I had no Idea whatever of making Â«o
lengthy an address, but I want to say this
word' to you: The Republicans are threading
the Idea that they stand for what Is known
as New San Francisco. A new Saa Francisco.
Why we stood for that seven yÂ«arÂ» ago.
didn't we? You saw me upon the t.latf<v:a
in this city preaching to the people then that
a new era. that a glorious day waa coming
for this city, that greater prosperity was com
ing, and that we must have a gre&tcr, a bigger
and a manlier kind of government than we
had If, we were going to realize iÂ»ur oppor
tunities.

Now there Isn't anything; that has hap

, /fc .crowded the Alhambra . last
Â« / evening shcvred more enthuei
/ \ asm over the prospect of a
2 \_ song from 'â¢Billy" Hynes than
desire to listen to the oratory of
Franklin K. Lane, the Democratic can
didate for Mayor has little cause of>om
j plaint at either the quality or spirit of his
:1 reception. The theater was not so crowd
ed at the end of the candidate's speech as
when he began- to address the large au
dience and there was a steady movement
f cr the door Ions before -he closed. Had
lie continued a few minutes? longer -..ha
vice presidents en the piatform might
have experienced something of the lone
someness of facing rows of empty chairs,
but the speaker realized the situation to
time to save it and was able to enjoy iae
gratification of hearty applause as he
took his seat.
In the address which virtually opened
the Democratic municipal campaign. Lane
outlined the situation as he says he >ecs
it and pointed out that in any hands but
his the charter would be a. powerful ma
chine for the robbery of .citizens. He
built an Interesting array of straw men
and with thrilling effect played ninepins
with his creations. He arraigned the labor
union administration of the city and pic
tured himself a? a Western Folk with a
divine call to rescue San Francisco from
the hands of her enemies.
The meeting was called to order by
Thomas W. Hickty, who declared open
the Democratic campaign uf 1S03 and
called James V. Coleman to the chair.
Coleman referred to the noise ar.d disor
der of the Democratic convention as in
dications of success inasmuch as they
had cleared the air arid left a way for
peace and good will.
Among the candidates for office that ad
dressed the meeting were Dr. Washington

(Billy) Hynes.
Hynes is running for Public Admlnistra-
I tor, but the audience wanted a socg more
. than a speech. They suffered the speech,
however, in the hope of a song to follow
and .when Hynes ltft without realizing
this anticipation the business of the meet
ing came to a standstill while the crowd
howled for Hynes. The efforts of the
chairman to restore order availed nothing
for a tpace of several minutes. In des
peration Lane was pushed to the front of
; the platform and the new interest caused
a pause in the pursuit of vaudeville.
Chairman Coleman made skillful use of
Â¦this pause and almost convinced the r.u
dience that their clamors had been for
Lane and not for a "Billy" Hynes spe
. cialty.
Realizing that Hynes had left the build

Â¦ candidate for Mayor, who spoke as fol

Mr. Chairman. Ladle; and Gentlemen: It

iTou have seen the men who axe on our plat

Thle c&mpa.gn is 'not a question of policies,
It, it rtol a question of platform!, it is not a
question of pronunclamentos. it l.Â« not a ques
tion of proclamations; it is a question of men.
What kind of men are they? Are they men oi
character? Are- they men who have the
Btrength to stand up against the temptations
that they will meet? Are they men who go
Into politics with the right kind of motives?
Are they men vfaV have high ideals? Are they
men devoted to the Inlerens of the city? Those
are the questions that you must consider in
this campaign, and those questions primarily.
My triends. we are practical politicians; we
â¢ re men in the Democratic- party, practical
men. and we believe that the best k;nd of
practical politics Is done by serving the city of
gan Francisco and its people best. < Applause.)

The chaotic condition of the Democratic
organization In Brooklyn was made evi
dent to-night, when Martin W. Lyttleton,
the Democratic candidate for borough
president, made his first campaign speech
at the. Seymour Club,. Lyttleton was in
troduced just after resolutions indorsing
all the candidates on the city ticket were
read and unanimously carried amid
cheers. He immediately launched into a
epeech condemning the course of Leader
Murphy and the delegates from Tam
many Hall at the convention, and made
it plain that the Brooklyn leaders would
not support either Grout or Fornes.
Xot much credence is given to the ru
mor that Robert V. Roosevelt, uncle of
the President, has been asked to take the
Tammany nomination for President of
Manhattan borough. While Roosevelt has
not been an active politician, he has been
an ardent Tammany man, and a few years
ago was a sachem In the Society of Tam

NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â All uncertainty
regarding the action of the Citizens'
Union and Republican organizations on
the question of ousting Messrs. Grout and
Fornes from the fusion ticket was re
moved to-night, when both conventions
reconvened and voted unanimously to re
scind the nominations for Comptroller
and Aldermanlc President made at the
original convention and to nominate in
stead Frederick W. Heinrichs of Brook
lyn and E. J. McGuire of Manhattan. At
the Citizens' Union convention in Cooper
Union, presided over by Francis C. Hunt-
Ington, little interest was shown in the
nominations. At the close of the conven
tion the delegates from the Bronx met
and named Coroner Joseph I. Berry, who
also has been nominated by the recom
mendations as borough president.
The Republican convention in Carnegie
Hall was presided over by former Lieu
tenant Governor Woodruff. The nomina
tions of Messrs. Heinrichs and McGuire
were accepted unanimously. Heinrichs
was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor
on the Gold Democratic ticket in 1S96; for
President of the boroug- of Brooklyn on
the Low ticket in 1897, and for State At

ticket in 1S0S. McGuire is an assistant

"I called the men in my father's shop

CHICAGO. Oct. 7.â Five hundred glove
makers employed in four factories went
on strike to-day because the employers
refused to grant demands for Increased
wages and to renew an agreement that
expired September 21. It is said the em
ployers will close the-ir plants until the
employes are ready to return to work.
Among the manufacturers whose em
ployes were called out is Samuel R. Clex

Glove Makers' Union No. 4, Sam R. Clex

was appointed to open negotiations with
the Franklin Union of Press Feeders for
a settlement, and an agreement was
reached in a few minutes whereby the
Franklin feeders will return to work to
morrow in all the Typothetae offices ex
cepting those where girls are employed
to feed presses.
After this had been accomplished, a
committee of seven members of the Ty
pothetae was named to bring about a
complete eettlement. Members of the Ty
pothetae acknowledged themselves routed,
and laid the blame for the failure of the
lockout on the pressmen.
A few weeks after the flight of the lieu
tenant his consort disappeared, and with
her went the undertaker who had pre
pared the bodies of her brother and
adopted son for burial, so the contestants
say. Incidentally, she took with her the
undertaker's silverware; It is further al
legedâat least the latter's wife stated so
in her report to the pollce-j-that Mrs.
Hentner had robbed her of her husband.
The couple went to Germany, where it
was learned the undertaker died sudden
ly. Then Mrs. Hentner came to this city
and opened massage parlors.
The : lawyers claim to have learned that
after her arrival here she collected Â«bout
her a number of men and prevailed upon
them to insure their lives in her favor.
Whatever were her plans concerning
them, the lawyers say they were nipped
in the. bud by her meeting with Knauer
and the events that followed.
Mrs. Knauer has been cited to appear
before Judge Troutt on October 20 to ex
plain away, if she can, the charges made
by. the attorneys on. behalf of Emilie
Wilms and Marie Dorbritz, sisters of the
deceased, and Julius Knauer, a brother.
WINS THE UNDERTAKER.
Three days later the will was filed for
probate, was admitted and Mrs. Knauer
was appointed administratrix of the
estate. It was then that the relatives
sought the advice of attorneys. They re
tained Bishop, Wheeler & Hoeffler and
this firm started a long search for Mrs.
Knauer's antecedents. They had little
difficulty, for she was known in Chicago
as Mrs. Hentner. They learned, they
state in their petition, that the woman
has had a variety of names and a career
that would put to shame^ an adventuress
created ,by Laura Jean Libby. They
found, they aver, that she was married
years ago in Germany; that her husband
took his own life rather than face the
disgrace that followed her elopement
with a German army officer; that she
came to Chicago with the lieutenant and
after a few months was joined there by
her brother and an adopted son; that the
four were inseparable until death claimed
the brother and adopted son, who both
died suddenly, and when the lieutenant
learned that they had both insured their
lives In favor of his consort he fled.
FILES KNAUER'S WTLL^
A few days after making the will
Knauer became very sick. An operation
was suggested by his wife and he con
sented. It was performed on December
29, but before submitting himself to the
knife he added a codicil to his
will cutting out the baquest to
his relatives and giving x his en
tire estate to his wife. He was 73 years
of age when operated upon and the shock
was more than his enfeebled condition
would permit. His relatives heard of his
condition and sought to approach him.
but could not get past his wife, they say,
and in consequence, when he died, Janu
ary 11, they had not been able to make it
known to him that they still cared for
him. '
This was in July and August of last
year and in September they went to llv.3
in a flat at 1059 Page street. They were
married there, though she insisted that
she cared not for his name. Then the
eld man was taken ill, and she cared for
him. On the 13th of December he made
his will, leaving her half of his e-Uate.
the other half being bequeathed to his
brothers and sisters and several nephews
nnd nieces.
Such a tale of woe naturally affected
her patient, his relatives say. His lot
had not always been cast in pleasant
places. He also thought he needed sym
pathy and the loving care of such a
woman and readily agreed that they
should finish their days together, as sho
ruggested.
"I do not want to marry you," she is
alleged to have said. "I Just want to
be with you and care for you and !ove
you. Your money I do not want. 1 love
you for your grandeur of character
alone."
AROUSES SYMPATHY.
Strange indeed, is the tale of the last
few months of the life of the aged Ger
man. It appears from the petition of
those who claim to be entitled to the
wealth now in the possession of his widow
that he first met. her in July. 1902. He
went to her for massage treatment, being
led thither by an advertisement in a
newspaper. She gave him treatment, and
he returned- again and again. During
those visits she learned of his wealth
and, his relatives claim, planned to se
cure It. This was an easy task appar
ently, for the old man was in his dotage.
She told him she was from the father
land, that she had lived a life beset with
trials and troubles and had never for one
brief Instant known what it was to be
free from care. She had never known
what it was to be happy, she told him,
and she gave him bits of her history that
so worked upon the old man's feelings
that he readily gave her his pity. She
told him that only the year before she
had lost a dearly beloved husband and
that within a few months after his death
the idol of her heart, an adopted son,
had passed away. The* came the death
of her brother, she said. All this hao
pered in Chicago. She told him. that she
coulc? not remain longer there because
of her sad thoughts and came to the
far West to forget and to commence
arew her struggle for a livelihood.
TAXB A STRANGE ONE.
, In a will made by Ferdinand -Knauer,
a wealth:- German who died in this city
last January, he bequeathed his $C0,000
estate to Marie Knauer, his young widow.
The old man's disposition of his wealth
is not pleasing to his relatives and they
have come forward to contest the will.
In two petitions for a revocation of the
order, admitting the will to probate, filed
by them" yesterday, they allege that the
young widow is an adventuress, and that
her marriage to their aged relative and
subsequent procurement of a will giving
her his wealth was but one of many acts
that have, made her notorious on two
continents. They say that she Is the per
sonification of craftiness, skilled in her
alleged trade of enriching herself at the
expense of those who fall within her
clutches, and a woman who has in her
pursuit of riches and a life of ease paused
at nothing to attain her ends. In fact,
they try to make of her a woman who
has ruined homes, broken hearts a-plenty
and more than once shared in the wealth
of those who found themselves in her
power and who were unable to withstand
her blandishments and persuasive elo
quence.
: Dresser said he had heard that an im
portant envelope containing matter
needed in this suit had been missed from
the files of the Trust Company of the
Republic, but declared he had nothing
to do with the abstraction of those
papers- -^
Schwab, he said, obtained control of the
Ship Building 'Company by getting men
on the board friendly to the Schwab in
terests and getting rid of those opposed
to his interests.
After recess. Dresser said that Schwab
had told him he believed the Ship Build
ing Company had a great future and that
he would be willing to put- $2,000,000 more
I cash Into the business, if necessary.
j When the French underwriting money
did not materialize, Dresser appealed to
I Pam, .tcunsel for Schwab, mentioning
1 Schwab's 'promise and stating that unless
$2,500.0000 was forthcoming to make good
'.the French underwriting, the' Bethlehem
j Company, could not get through. Pam
' suggested they call on Perkins of Morgan
& Co., who agreed to, deposit the necessary
j amount in various institutions, though
not as a loan to the promoters. They
thus obtained $2,100,000. They pledged the
j security of the French underwriters and
Â¦ Lewis Nixon and he gave the notes,
dresser eaid only $27,000 was ever received
1 from the French underwriters out of the
$4,250,000 he had been assured would be
forthcoming. If. the French underwriters
had fulfilled their obligations there would
have been no trouble.
This was agreed to, the arrangement
also providing that he receive with the
bonds a stock bonus of $9,000,000 of the
common and preferred stock of the ship
building company, Schwab stating that
$2,000,000 of the stock was to go to J. P.
Morgan & Co.
When the contract was presented for
signature It was fo^-id to call for the
purchase by Dresser and Nixon person
ally of 99,800 shares of the Bethlehem
Company's stock from J. P. Morgan &
Co. for $7,246,781 cash, $2,500,000 in common
stock of the United States Shipbuilding
Company and an equal amount of the pre
ferred. Dresser said he obj^tPd to ob
ligating himself personally, but Schwab
explained that the deal would be carried
out that way and that on the day for
payment he. would provide the cash to
make the payment. Then Dresser and
Nixon were to hand the cash to Morgan
& Co.. who would hand over the Bethle
hem stock mentioned In the contract.
The deal was consummated on August
11. 1902, Schwab giving his personal check,
which was indorsed over to J. P. Morgan
& Co. For the stock of the Bethlehem
Company, Dresser said, there was really
given $10,000,000 in bonds. $9,000,000 in com
mon stock and $9,000,000 In preferred.
There was some talk of pooling the stock
of the shipbuilding company, . he said.
Schwab Insisting that all stock be held
until his and Mr. Morgan's had been put
on the market.
A paragraph was read from the agree
ment referring to the authority to sell
15,000 shares of the common and a like
amount of the preferred stock, and Dres
ser said he understood 250,000 shares of
the common and 200,000 shares of the pre
ferred stock of the shipbuilding company
were pooled with Harris, Gates & Co. '
HOW SCHWAB GOT CONTROL.
"We to!d him we could not trade on
any such basis," said Dresser, "because
we had no cash, and he said he would
take $10,000,000 in bonds at 90 for the
?9,000,000."
The purchase of the Bethlehem Steel
Works for the shipbuilding company was
then discussed. Dresser stating that the
overtures for the sale of the steel com
pany had been made by Charles M.
Schwab, who said he owned nearly all
the stock of the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany and that, because of its armor mak
ing capacity, he believed the company
would do better with the shipbuilding
company than with the United States
Steel Corporation.
Schwab, according to Dresser, said he
wanted $9,000,000 cash for this stock, and
submitted reports which showed that it
cost more than $7,000,000 and was earning
$1,450,000 a year.
Dresser identified a copy of the pros
pectus and it was admitted In evidence.
He said all the underwriting secured by
the Trust Company of the Republic was
obtained for the Mercantile Trust Com
pany. The response to the advertisement
for subscriptions was poor, he said, not
more than $000,000 of the bonds being ap
plied for In America.
Dresser said he had no written state
ment as to the value of the companies in
the corporation when he 'undertook the
underwriting, but Lewis Nixon and John
W. Young had made oral representations.
The Mercantile Trust Company, he was
told by Colonel McCook, secured the rest
of the underwriting, principally In
France. The Trust Company of the Re
public, Dresser said, had framed the
prospectus of June, 1902, offering the
bonds to the public, the trust company
taking the Information contained in it
from the firm of Alexander & Green,
counsel, and Rigdell & Common, account
ants, without investigating any state
ments made by them.
NO WRITTEN STATEMENT.
' Dresser, who took the sland at the
opening of the hearing, testified that he
was president of the Trust Company of
the Republic from its "organization, March
31, 1902, until March 4, 1903. He told of
the visit to him In April, 1902, of John J.
McCook, who . told him ' Â¦ he came from
John W. Young and the Mercantile Trust
Company and asked The Trust Company
of the Republic to underwrite $3,000,000 of
the stock of the United States Shipbuild
ing Company, showing Dresser the un
derwriting agreement, which said that
$3,000,000 had been taken in London and
$3,000,00i) in France. The trust company
authorized him to get the underwriting,
which he did. Later he increased the un
derwriting to $4,750,000, at the request of
the promoters, because they said London
had failed to take the $3,000,000 it promised
to take.
Dresser also told of his original agree
ment as president of the Trust Company
of the Republic to obtain the underwrit
ing of J3,000,000 of United States Ship
building stock; how this was increased
to $4,750,000 by the failure of the French
subscribers to pay up; how Schwab came
to offer the Bethlehem works to the ship
building company, and how J. P. Morgan
& Co. then came into the' transaction.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â One of the most

had bten made the victim of a perfidious
blackmailing scheme at the hands of his
son Frederick and his nieces, the Boxall
girls. He branded Frederick as an in

the testimony of the two nieces he could
demonstrate that their story was a mali
cious fabrication, compounded for the
purpose of wringing money from their
uncle.
Garland is accused of having misrepre
sented the actual value of the Crocker
property, at the corner of Sixth and Main
streets, and of finally manipulating its
sale for $25,000, so that later it became the
property of his father-in-law, who was
enabled to sell It at a greatly advanced
figure. In answer to the allegations of
the plaintiffs, Garland to-day contended
that he had tried repeatedly to sell the
property for $30,000, but could not obtain
even $25,000 for it; that the plaintiffs
knew the value of the property at that
time and that they had signified their
willingness to sell at the price which he
obtained.

Leaving Boxall and Horace Little, a

escape of Lloyd, Frederick took the train
to Berkeley to rescue his 15-year-old sis
ter, Kthel, from the clutches of a man
whom he thought to be a monster.
ASXS SON'S AKREST.
It was at this juncture that Lloyd Sr.
managed to get a telegTam to Marshal
Kerns of Berkeley, warning him to de
tain Frederick as one mentally unbal
anced. Upon the same night, while he
was virtually under the muzzle of Box
all's and Little's revolvers, Lloyd think
ing that he saw a chance to escape, made
the break for liberty, only to fall with a
pistol ball from Boxall's gun in bis back.
The larger part of the afternoon was
devoted to the reading of the deposition
of Margaret Boxall, most of which Is of
a character to forbid publication. It re
cited how their uncle had obtained a
power over the girls through his support
of themselves and their family and de
tailed how he used this advantage to
force them into unlawful relations with
him for years. Xot only did the amours
of the uncle extend to them, but several
other young women. Including a female

STRANGER IS ARRESTED
BY WHITE HOUSE GUARDS
On January 31 Boxall, the nephew of
Lloyd, shot the capitalist in his own
home, the Shacks, in San Bernardino
County. He claimed that he was aveng
ing the wrong done his two sisters, Nes
tor and Margaret Boxall, by their uncle.
They had confessed to him and to Fred
erick W. Lloyd, according to the state
ments of both young men, that since
June. 1S%, their own uncle had from time
to time forced them, on the peril of with
drawing his financial support both from
tnem and the-ir family, to suffer out
rageous treatment at his hands.
After hovering between l!fe and death
for weeks, the man whom Boxall had se
verely wounded recovered. His first step
was to draw ud a new will. In which his
eldest son, Frederick W. Lloyd, was cut
off without a penny. Then, while en
route to the Orient in June last, L'.oyd
was stricken with heart failure "and died
on the steamer. It Is in the endeavor to
prevent th!s laBt will of his father from
going to probate that Lloyd, the eon, has
introduced the suit.
In answer to the heinous charges which
have been brought against the memory of
the father by the ton. W. S. 1 Goodfellow,
one of the attorneys for the beneficiaries,
declared in his opening statement yester
day that the former Berkeley capitalist
there r^sts the tremendous re
5pcr.?ibility of determining the truth or
faSsjty of a most heinous charge brought
against the memory of the late capitalist
Charles R. Lloyd by his own Eon, Fred
erick W. Lloyd. Their decision will prove
that the man who is now molderir.g in
his tomb was either the most hideous
moral degenerate since the days cf Em
peror Caracalia or that he was a kind
hearted philanthropist, whose character
was blackened and death hastened by the
machinations of a plot of which his eldest
sen was the prime instigator and most
relentless conspirator.
In the preliminary statements by attor
neys and the unfinished reading of the
deposition of one absent witness to-day
it was developed that in the suit brought
by Frederick W. Lloyd \o annul the last
testament of his father all of the hidden
mysteries surrounding the shooting of
Charles R. Lloyd by William Boxall. his
nephew, at San Bernardino, on January
31 last, are to be revealed. In fact, im
portant revelations were made before the
court which show the animus of the
shooting in a light heretofore only partly
disclosed, and which, if proven true by
subsequent testimony, will demonstrate
the truth that Boxall's bullets were Justly
BLACKMA3X CHAEGED.

The suits attracted wide attention
here, and had they been successful it is
probable that additional suits would
have been filed against various flfms
here. /
The declination of Commissioner Sar
gent to institute proceedings against
Bishop did not, however, prevent indi
viduals from commencing action, and on
the refusal of C. Brewer & Co. to pay
$113,000, the amount of the penalty, suit
was commenced by Berger for the
amount. The law provides that the en
tire penalty recovered through action in
the courts goes to the individual bring
ing the suit. Berger 13 a young man. Just
past his majority, and it is believed that
he acted for a syndicate which had com
plete knowledge of the operations in
volved in the importation of Korean la
borers by C. Brewer & Co.
When Commissioner of Immigration
Sargent -visited Honolulu he made a
thorough investigation into the matter of
the Importation of the Koreans and to
gether with United States District Attor
ney R. X. Breckons decided that the firm
of C. Brewer & Co. had acted In good
faith, and that there had been no viola
tion of the statute, and therefore de
clined to prosecute In behalf of the United
States.
HONOLULU. Oct. 7.â The 113 suits filed
by Frederick Berger against B. Faxon
Bishop, secretary of the. firm of C. Brewer
& Co., for alleged violation of the United
States Immigration laws, in encouraging
Koreans to come hither to work as plan
tation laborers, have been withdrawn.
Each of the 113 suits filed against Bishop
by Berger involved $1000. A decision of
Judge Estee, sustaining the demurrer of
the defendant, is regarded as a final set
tlement of the matter. The defendant has
agreed to pay the costs of the * suits,
amounting to $1400.
The suits resulted from, a visit to Korea
made by Bishop in the interests of a
large number of planters. He succeeded
in securing a large number of Koreans
and they were brought to Hawaii to work
in the sugar fields. Before departing for
Korea Bishop fortified himself with writ
ten instructions from the United States
Treasury Department bearing on the
matter of the Importation of foreigners.
The law governing the case, however,
wag amended by the last Congress and
Brewer & Co. were notified that the for
mer instructions did not apply under the
new law, whereupon the firm discon
tinued its efforts to attract Koreans
hither.
.nuir-iFslons to sick report from alcoholism

cumber of 1S30 cases, equivalent to 22. C5 per
thourar.-l of strength, occurred. It is impos
sible not to attribute a large part of the
steadily increasing disease of the army to the
loss of the canteen, where the soldier, if he
so desired, could set his beer throughout the
month, but was not subjected to the tempta
tions to lntemiierance and vice now attendant
upon the expenditure of a full month's pay at
the low resorts infesting the outskirts of our
mllitarr reservations.
A slirht diminution of Insanity occurred In
the army during 16f>2. There were 13S new
cases, equivalent to the admission rate of 1.71
per thousand which Is almost identical with
the rate for the decade 1S91 to 190i>.

of Surgeon General Ft. M. OUrllly for the
fiscal year ending June 30. This Increase
is attributed. to cholera, which caused 3i4
deaths per 1000. A slight improvement
shows In the admission rate for disease
and Injury which declined from 1791.53 \*r
1000 in 1901 to 1716.51 per 1000 in 1902. Dis
cussing other features of the health of the
army. Surgeon O'Rollly's report says:
The enrollment of about ftOOO native Filipino
scouts having atMerf a nfw racial element to
the army It becomes a matter of much interest
to study the comparative effect* of dlnoase on
them and on our white anrt colored troars.
For the whole army, at home and abroad, dur
ing the rear 1902 the whltÂ» troops showed an
admission rate of 1706.33 per thoutand and a
death rate of 14.40. The nerro trcoD* had
1897.74 admissions and 24.11 deaths p*r thou
sand aafl the Malay scout* 1707. SI sdmlislons
and 24.04 deaths per thousand. The white
race, therefore, save the lowest nÂ«ureÂ» In *Â»<â¢*
ness and much the lowest mortality. The
black race led In both, although the Malay
closely approached It in death rate.
The freedom of KUlplnos from the vice of
drunkenness Is strikingly shown when we find
that out of 5000 men only three individuals
were treated for alcoholism in on* year, and
that while white soldiers were admitted to
sick rer>ort on account of their own miscon
duct In the use of alcohol at the rate of 24.78
per thousand, and colored troops at the rate
of 11.70. the Malay scouts showed the ex
tremely small admission rate of .c2 per thou

The young people will, â¢ on their return
from their wedding trip, set up 'Â¦ their
household gods in' this city, in 'Â«."-* home
already prepared for them. In ~ the .' nup
tials of last night I a romance jj begun in
the dim days of childhood had a fitting
culmination.
The billiard room was pressed into ser
vice for supper tables, and here the moth
er of the bride presided; pink gladiolas,
pink tulle and pink shades produced a
charming effect in the improvised dining
hall, where the older folks made merry.
The bride, who Is a girl of striking
beauty and style, fulfilled every tradi
tion of bridal beauty in her robe of lace,
with its court train of glistening satin.
In her arms she bore St. Joseph lilies.
She was attended by her sister, Miss Ella
Morgan, who looked not less lovely than
the bride, attired in a filmy gown of
Â¦white chiffon, and carrying a. rare bunch
of orchids. Then came the maids. Miss
Genevieve King, Miss Ruth McNutt, Miss
Mary Josselyn and Miss Helen Dean, all
gowned in white chiffon over green and
bearing huge bunches of tiger lilies. The
mother of the bride was attired in a
beautiful court gown of black satin
moire. A description ' of the guests'
gowns would read like a fashion journal,
for it is seldom so many elegantly gowned
matrons and dainty dressed maidens are
seen at a private . functio'n.
The simple service over, the guestsâ
about 150â were received by the bridal pair
and a merry hour ensued.
The drawing-room was a symphony in
the colors btloved of nature â green and
white. Again the woodwardia lent its
beauty, phalanxed by forests of feathery
ferns, white chrysanthemums and be
gonias, with here and there a cloud of
filmy tulle. The dining-room bore the
ripening riches of autumn; overhead
grapevines bearing their purple. . iruit
stretched from wall to wall, pomegran
ates grew in profusion, and even boughs
of lemon trees lent their yellow fruit to
grace the hour. The tables were simply
adorned with maidenhair and white can
delabra, the distinctive feature at the
bride's place being a shower of tiny silver
bells rising like a spray of lilies of the
valley, which in truth they very much
resembled. .
THE wedding of Miss Therese Mor
gan, daughter of William P. Mor
gan, and Norris Davis was cele
brated lagt night at the beautiful
home of. the bride with all the ac
cessories that wealth and good taste could
devise.
The lower floor of the home had been
wrought into a bower of beauty; blossoms
and ferns, the richest gifts of nature, had
been gathered here to make glad the
happy hour when the twain were made
one.
The reception hall became a wild wood
glen under the hands of the decorators,
the waving woodwardia rising from ev
ery nook. Banks of* American . Beauty
roses filled the recess by the staircase,
giving forth a delicious touch of autumnal
warmth.
The ceremony was performed by the
Rev. Dr. Clampett in the reception room,
where an altar had been reared draped In
snowy lace and bearing candles and pure
white blossomsâ a fitting shrine at which
to give the lifelong promise. Here kneel
ing upon white satin cushions the young
folks plighted their troth.
CHARMING SOCIETY GIRL
WHO WEDDED YESTERDAY
AND HER BRIDESMAIDS.
A family dinner was held this evening
with forty-two covers. Afterward the
wedding couple started in a motor car
presented by the Czar for Heilig to
spend the honeymoon. The town is beau
tifully illuminated to-night and the wed
ding was favored with splendid weather.
The church was filled with diplomats,
the local authorities and the royal suites.
The Protestant ceremony lasted three
quarters of an hour, j the officiating
clergyman being Rev. Dr. Peterson. The
party then, amid the ringing of the fa
mous chimes, drove in the reverse order to
the Greek chapel, a mile distant, where
they were greeted by a large crowd.
There the marriage ceremony was cele
brated according to the Greek rites by
Archprlest Janltscheff.

of a notable gathering, /which included an

Queens, the marriage of Princess Alice of

was celebrated to-day, according to the
rites of the Lutheran and Greek churches.

ROYALTY AT WEDDING
Babetta Alber, a comely Swedish wo
man, was married to Josplr W. Alber In
New York In 1901. A few weeks after she
became hla wife she left him and came to
this city and brought a suit for divorce on
the ground of neglect.
Judge Kerrigan yesterday heard her
tale of woe and granted her an Interlocu
tory decree. She said she left her hus
band because he made her life miserable
by continually boasting of the number of
lady friends he had.
Beatrice C. Otway has finished her race
for a divorce, winning a decree for deser
tion. Her suit was filed a few days ago,
just a half-hour sooner than that filed by
her husband. Michael, Otway.
Joseph C. Feld, a police officer, Is being
sued for divorce by Alice E. Feld, to
whom he was married on August 6, 1900.
She charges cruelty. In her ! complaint
she says he once broke a Jardiniere over
her head and on several occasions threat
ened to kill her. They have one child, a
daughter, aged 2 years.

cruelty; Carrie Kreuger from Oscar Kreu
ger, for desertion; W. G. Thomas from

EUREKA, Oct. 7.â The local land office
received . the following telegram from
Washington yesterday:
GTants Protection to All Who Have
Filed in the Eureka District
Forest Reserve.
LAND OFFICE MAKES
AN IMPORTANT RULING
THE State Board of Trade has .authorized effi
cient measures looking to the protection of the
fruit planters of this State against the robbery
and rapacity of middlemen who handle their
products. The consumer pays a good price ' for
California fruit products. If that price, less freight
and commissions, reached the producer, the fruit.in
dustry of this State would be the most profitable
rural occupation in the world. But the producer is
robbed in the home market, and in every market
from San Francisco to London, by the dishonest
practices of the middlemen.. . Â¦
Cur fruit product has no superior in the world. In
prunes, raisins and every description of dried and
canned fruit we equal or lead the world in quality.
Consumers eagerly seek our products, and "Califor
nia" on a fruit package is a trademark commanding
respect everywhere. Yet the producer is grossly
abused and brazenly cheated out of the profit that
should reward his toil and enterprise. During the
discussion of the matter by the Board of Trade prac
tices were disclosed that amount' to stealing, "larceny
under the statutes. Such practices are not confyied
to the distant market, cither. They prevail right
here in San Francisco, where every country shipment
is , looted.
We have no doubt that the Board of Trade can
secure evidencc\of these dishonest practices that will
make a case for criminal prosecution. The producer
is almost helpless. His property is perishable. It
has to go forward to market on the hour, lest it
spoil. He is working hard at home and cannot fol
low his shipment to the city, and has to take what
ever return is sent to him. One producer did follow
his shipment and, being unknown, bought the whole
lot of the commission man, paying a good price and
taking a proper bill of sale. He removed the prop
erty from the warehouse and went home and waited.
In due time came a return, showing the property sold
for a nominal price, reporting it in bad condition and
bringing him out in debt to the commission man on
the shipment. He followed the matter up and com
pelled a disgorgement of the stolen profits. It is to
be regretted that he stopped there. He would have
protected himself and others, by criminally prosecut
ing the robber."
It is the intention of the Board of Trade to go to
the bedrock in 'this matter, and it should have the
assistance of the'producers' all over the 'State. It has
the power arid the resources to wholly expose the
system of robbery that has its dishonest hand in the
pocket of every fruit planter - in the State, and we
are persuaded that when its work is* done there will
be fewer, robbers standing between the producer, and
consumer Â¦ ... â¢ .

Next to the swift development of the trend toward
the Republican ticket the most salient feature of the
campaign is the recourse of the Examiner to "mud
dinging" as a political weapon. Not liking to dance
to McNab's command, nor to support for Mayor a
man whom it denounced only a short time ago as an
enemy of labor and a creature of McNabf it turns
to its familiar tactics of slandering everybody in sight.
Such tactics are of course disagreeable to the public
and disgusting to the intelligent, but it is not likely
they will help Lane. They are much more likely to
help Crocker by driving all decent Democrats into a
camp where decency prevails and where the only tac
tics to be employed are those of straight politics and
of honest men.
That a portion of the normal Republican vote will
go to Schmitz, or remain at home on election day,
may be conceded; but it is certain that defections of
that kind will not seriously imperil the ticket if the
independent vote come to its support. The indepen
dents are already aware of that fact and will act ac
cordinglj-. They could not elect Lane even should
they vote for him solidly, but they can elect Crocker.
Hence the movement of the independent vote of the
city will be steadily toward Mr. Crocker from this
time on.
RARELY has a three-cornered municipal con
test so swiftly shaped itself into a clear-cut
definite issue as has this one. The campaign
has barely begun â in fact, the Republican ratifica
tion meeting has not yet been held â but already there
is a widespread public consciousness that the fight
is between the Republican party and the various fac
tions that hive combined to form the Union Labor
party. The Democratic party figures in the problem
only as an unknown quantity whose relation to the
â¢nain factors is not yet clearly discernible.
It is well known that the election of Schmitz was
the result of a division of the conservative vote be
tween the and Republicans in the con
test. A similar division this year would have a simi
lar result. The intelligence of the voters perceives
the danger and accordingly will be on guard against
it. Men of good understanding are not going to
permit themselves to be caught twice in the same
trap. Th's will net be a repetition okthe contest in
which the conservative vote was dividcu and the dis
contented vote was united. This time the conserva
tive elements of the city will unite behind the Repub
lican leadtrs and carry the entire ticket to victory.
It is of course right and fitting it should be so.
Mr. I.ane is a genial gentleman deservedly popular
among his friends, who are numerous, but he is ab
solutely unfitted for the emergency that now con
fronts the city. While it is to Mr. Lane's credit
that he is opposed by the Hearst faction of the Dem
ocratic party, nevertheless the existence of that oppo
sition on the part of men who delight in the "stab
in the back' on election day renders his candidacy
a forlorn hope. It is a political impossibility for him
to defeat Schmitz. The common sense of the people
recognizes that fact, and accordingly some of the
closest personal as well as political friends of Mr.
Lane will on election day cast their vote for Mr.
Crocker :n order to assure the city of an efficient
businesslike administration.
It is gratifying that the dominant issue in the cam
paign has been thus clearly formulated at once, and
with snch plainness that all citizens can see it and un
derstand it. It is now a three-cornered fight in name
only. Virtually it is a contest between the forces
that have mismanaged the municipal government for
the past term and the forces of good citizenship
ranged under the banners of the Republican party.
The prompt development of that issue simplifies the
struggle and to a large extent Â«relieves it of doubt and
uncertainty. San Francisco is normally a Republican
city, having a political sentiment in^ harmony with
that of the State and of the nation. It therefore fol
lows that if the rank and file of- the party remain
true to its traditions there would be a victory for Mr.
Crocker and his colleagues even without indepen
dent support.
CROCKER OR SCHMITZ
MAYOR SCHMITZ again declares that he is
a credit to the city. ;; He has played another
solo serenade to himself and has put his hand
on his heart and bowed his acknowledgments of the
honor to himself. But he also declares that Mr.
Lane is not a credit to the city and that this, is so
well understood that he will be third in the race.
Then Mr. Lane again produces hrs bugle; horn and
blows on it a blast of hot and sweetened air for Lane,
the popular favorite, the only righteous man, the fa
vorite of destiny. But. he., is of_ . the â .opinion that
Mayor Schmitz is not a credit to the, city! .. . . , â¢Â¦
It places the plain and much occupied citizen in a
very difficult position,! more "difficult than that of St.
Paul when he was asked, "What -is truth?" v and, we
believe, responded, "I don't know." -Which; oh!
which, of these well-dressed candidates is a credit .to
the city? Each says he' is and that' the other is not.
It is a tie. Can they be made to draw cuts to settle
it? Â» Mayor Schmitz has also .ventured to explain
that he has varied his regular stunt of being a credit
to the city by going to New; York^to' make speeches
for William Randolph Hearsi in order ' to' aid labor.
He says it was a pilgrimage of gratitude, and that his
oratory in the tenderloin was classified under the
grateful head. We arc glad to hear this â gratitude is
so rare, in public life that it is above rubies. We are
inclined to think that this explanation is a horse on
Lane. He did not go to New York. He did not
love his neighbor William. Randolph Hearst as him
self. In fact, he had no affection for him at all; any
way, if he had he concealed it as carefully as Lord
Byron did his club foot.
In the emergency presented by these two candi
dates we can see nothing for the people to do except
select for themselves a Mayor who will be a credit to
the city by electing Henry J. Crocker.

RIVAL SOLOS.
The bill creating: the office of Code Com
missioner was framed by Senator Selvage
at the last session of the Legislature and
he was instrumental in securing Its pas
sage. The act repealed the former law.
under which three Code Commissioners
served. The three Commissioners who
went out of office when the present law
was enacted accomplished a great deal of
work toward the revision and codification
of the laws and submitted this work to
the Legislature in the form of a number
of bills, but these bills failed to pass both
houses, leaving the laws In practically
the same shape as before. It is thought
probable that Judge Davis will avail him
self of much of' the material prepared by
the former Commissioners.
The new Commissioner served -in the
Senate for two sessions of the Legislature
prior to the last, once occupied a place on
the Superior bench and was a Republican
candidate for Congress. lie took a prom
inent part in' the last State convention,
which nominated Governor Pardee, and
was frequently called in consultation by
the Governor last winter with respect to
bills awaiting the approval of the execu
tive. He Is a native Californian and a
lawyer of recognized ability. The act
provides that the Commissioner shall
serve for two years from May. 1903, and
shall have authority to appoint a sten
ographer, who shall also be secretary of
the commission.

Code Commissioner
by Governor.
Former Senator Is Appointed
Every American city tbat lias at
tempted to operate its; public utilities
has failed In the experiment. Failure
would meet the effort* of thia city to op
erate the Geary-street road. Vote to
day against the proposition.
There is probably no other man on earth so skilled
in the gentle art of making enemies as is the incor
rigible Castro of Venezuela. He has instituted a
reign of terror at Ciudad Bolivar, paralyzing trade,
collecting customs duties which have already been
paid and otherwise inflicting insults and outrages
upon German and other resident foreign merchants.
His suppression has almost become a duty of self
respect on the part of Uncle Sam.
To make the park more pleasing It is
proposed to stock it with game birds, but
this does not mean that shooting will be
allowed in the park limits. On the con
trary, the park warden is Instructed not
to permit visitors to bring: In firearms.
Nevertheless, some way will have to be
devised to rid the park of mountain lions
and wildcats, of t which there are many
among the ridges about the Big Basin.
Parties may be especially authorized to
clean out these beasts. Wildcats would
prevent the successful stocking of the
basin with game birds.
The commissioners made the road from
Slippery Rock to the Governor's camp
fourteen feet wide. The cost of the road,
including map, profile, etc., was but 12100.
The State commission having In charge
the Big Basin Park met in this city yes
terday and audited bills. These showed
that all the expenditures of the last year
to date have amounted to $3200. This in
cluded the salary of the guardian, the
construction of a road about two miles
long from -what Is known as Slippery
Rock to the Governor's camp, the ex
pense of putting: out a big flre that
burned, over the surface of 20Q. acres, the
subsequent conversion of burned trees
into marketable firewood, the construc
tion of fire trails and all other costs. The
members of the commission entertained
the idea that the park can be maintained
for $3000 per annum. There is on hand
J1S00 for use up to Julyl, 19CM.
During the j'ear the sum of $100,000 waa
paid over to the parties from whom the
park was purchased by the State. This
amounts to 40, per cent of the cost price.
The remainder is $150,000. The commis
sioners say that" next season the park will
be open for campers. Fire trails for back
firing will be put around the eligible
camping places. The fire of the past
summer did not Injure any of the red
wood trees. Â¦Â»
2. 'ihai we had seen i>rcdiKat waste of tiie
beautiful oaks of 'Yosemite, which were con
stantly carted about the valley for firewoodâ
and might be seen there any day oiled up la
stacks of so mf.nv cords to to many dollars â
at the same time the whole valley was strewn
with dead branches and fallen timber â suit
able for stovewood and preoentlntc thÂ« only
real menace to the safety of the valley Id cas*
of forest fire.
3. Our next point was that the beautiful
flowering shrub* of the valley were choice
and ornamental In their nature, (hat they
were fit adornments of a public park and \*erÂ»
the homes of the aurlolea. red-created wren*.
robins and many other birds, and the shelter
of the squirrels, etc.. all of which add greatly
to the' natural beauty and interest of Yoaetnlte.
Had there been time I would also have re
minded the commission that these beautiful
shrubs attract moisture and preserve motsture
In the Kround and are placed there for this
purpose in the rrand economy of nature. That
for till* reason they act a.* a. wet blanket on
accidental fire and should be Dreserred la
every possible way.
-I. We next spoke of the extensive fenced
pastures already existing in Yosemlte for tbÂ«
purpose of Brazing the stock of concessioners,
and objected to the practice of letting thÂ«
animals out of these paÂ»tureÂ» to feed In every
nock and corner ot the valley, thereby ex
terminating the flowÂ»rÂ» which would otherwise
stand In perpetuity to d>llÂ«ht comln* genera
tions.
We finally claimed:
Firstâ That no more Â©"tares should Â»â¢
fenced In from this inalienable public reserva
tion.
Second â That the stock of concessioners
should be kept within tne pasture* assigned to
them.
Third â That the oaks being one of the most
exquisite park-like features of the valley and
being only sparsely scattered over It. should
remain there. That from this day not one
more should be cut down for the Ignoble pur
pose of stovewood or any other reason. .
Fourth â That the flowering shrubs should
rynmlg for t-i**ir mstf ulr.em In pr*?\ flr*
and as the homes of the birds and ctaer wild
creature* of Yoeemlte; also on acconnt of their
fitness and beauty as one of the r*re park
like features of the valley.
Kifth â That the deadly fire promoters, la
the way of dangerous fallen branches and
trees, should be gradually cleared up for stove,
wood and cam:? fires.
Btxth â That as coal oil and electricity werÂ«
both of them leas expensive for cooking than,
the cutting down of trees there waa not thÂ»
slightest reasonâ on any count whateverâ to
continue this mutilation of the gnat valley.
Seventhâ That it should be the duty of some
trustworthy employe to see that any nrÂ«
started accidentally or otherwise should be at
once extinguished In order to prevent the re
currence of the willful neglect of this last
summer. - â¢ '
I would now add that we women of Saa
Francisco have Keen enouch of what these so
called experts recommend. In the dolnsrs of
last summer, and do not want any continuance
of the plans advised by them. Their measures
all tend to promote the growth of sraln hay
and the profits accruing therefrom, and. aÂ» a
consequence, fhe extinction of the park-like
features of Ycsemlte.
Enormous pastures already exist In the val
ley and we feel that grain hay can also bÂ«
grown elsewhere. In Golden Gate Park we
would scarcely like to see the cutting down
of oak* for stovewood and the clearing away
of shrubs for pastures. Why then should we
tolerate such things in a park of unparalleled
grandeur placed In our hands as a. trust â not
belonging exclusively to usâ but at the same
time bringing In to the State a continually In
creasing ratio of enormous material returns.
An expert might tell me fifty times that
by cutting off my nose 1 would Improve my
face. I should still keep my now. An*- so
It is with our beautiful park In the heart of
the Sierras: these experts cannot persuade us
that It will be Improved by removing. Its
sparsely scattered oaks and destroying It*
park-like features. We prefer preserving them.
In Yosemlte Valley we want art assisting
nature by those who know the names of theaÂ«
beautiful plants and trees and what they are
worth and Instead of the present destructive
and barbaric forces in Its management, we
want fostering Roving lxrVCilli , GS .

1. We therefore attended the commission
ers' last meeting and stated that Ihere had
been willful and cross neglect of forest fires
thin summer In the little Yoaemlte Valley
and <n the Tllonette Canyon, while the third
one near KI Capltan had been very Unily man
aged and that Kreat injury to the valley ha-i
resulted from this neulect.
Editor The Call: I have Just *t*a the re
port of the Yosemlt* ComralMloiwrs' meeting
as (riven out in the dailies of Tuesday. Sep
tember 29. As It contains a very incorrect
account of our statements to them I b*g
leave to make a more exact reowrt of what
was put before the commission.
The effect of borrowing upon the public credit is
best illustrated by Glasgow. In 1896 the 2V2 per
cent bonds of that city were at 139. Now they are
118. Her 2 z / 2 per cents were 103. Now they are 86.
Here we are just proposing to enter upon a policy
that in Great Britain has forced the taxpayers to pro
pose a limitation of the franchise, and that has
pushed taxation to the limit of endurance. We agree
with Governor Pingree that the taxpayer shall be left
free, and that public utilities in public ownership
shall carry their own bonds.
THE Examiner, in the course of its campaign
to urge that the city incumber itself with a debt
of $710,000 to try an experiment in business by
-o\vning and running the Geary-street road, resorts to
a public ownership publication in Great Britain
called the "Municipal Year Book." From this is ex
tracted evidence that government in /Great Britain
gets large profits by carrying on business enterprises.
If municipal government in that kingdom exist for
the purpose of conducting business for profit, it is on
a different basis from government in the United
States. Making bread and beer, building tenement
houses, and invading at many points the business
field, are now considered by the British socialists as
among the propet concerns of government. No
doubt American socialists entertain the same views
and are moving toward their realization by the same
steps that were taken in Great Britain. The effect
there has been a large increase in municipal debt and
taxation. Yet the socialists are not impressed by
this, but urge English towns forward in the Isame
line and to the conquest of other lines of business.
The London Times, after submitting expert re
ports on municipal trading, says: "The time has
come for the British people to say w.hether or not
they concur in the transfer, not only of great specu
lative and often even experimental industries, but of
all sorts of minor trades as well, to municipal con
trol; whether or not it is desirable that our towns
and cities should be changed into essentially s'qcialis
tic communities, where trade, industry and local gov
ernment will all be conducted^on socialistic lines;
whether or not the incurring of stupendous financial
iiabilities, the rapid accumulation of local debts, and
the increase to an almost unbearable extent of local
taxation, are consistent with the best interests, not
only of the towns and localities concerned, but of the
nation at large; and whether, assuming that all these
things are right and desirable, the status of our local
governing bodies is being maintained at so high a
point that one may feel perfect confidence in their
efficiency alike for dealing with questions of public
health and of ordinary local government, for the con
duct of so many great and varied industries -and en
terprises, and for the wise and effective control of a
huge municipal indebtedness, so that it shall not be
come a menace to the welfare of the country."
This raises the question of the political influence
of municipal employes engaged in the business en
terprises under public ownership. This has already
become a sore spot in Glasgow. In Birmingham it
has grown to be such an abuse that to meet it it is
proposed that all such municipal employes be dis
franchised, because they use the franchise in utter
disregard of the interests of the taxpayers. All over
Great Britain there is spreading a defensive "Prop
erty-owners' and Taxpayers' Association," organized
to resist the exactions of the municipal employes. It
will be seen, therefore, that in that kingdom a greater
evil has taken the place of what we complain of here
as the influence of corporations upon our legislative
bodies. It is a greater evil because corporate inter
ference in this country does not work a direct in
crease in our burden of public taxation.
In urging that the Geary-street bonds be made a
lien on the road only, we have had in mind the
avoidance of that crying evil which has compelled
the British taxpayers to organized resistance. It is
not true that to make the bonds a lien on the plant
alone is a bar to public ownership and a hindrance to
its administration. The late Governor Pingree of
Michigan was one of the earliest advocates of the
public ownership of street railways in this country.
While he was Governor he procured the passage by
the Legislature of the McLeod law, authorizing the
city of Detroit to acquire and operate street railroads'
which expressly provided that the credit of the city
should not be pledged to obtain funds for that
purpose, but that all bonds should be a lien on the
roads only, and their earnings alone should be
pledged as security. Pingree was undoubtedly im
pressed by the experience of Great Britain and de
sired to make it impossible for large bodies of mu
nicipal employes to compel legislation in their favor
to the oppression of the taxpayers. Even in Glasgow
the Lord Provost of the municipality has advocated
a limitation of the franchise of the 15,000 employes
because they abuse their power in politics. *
The Examiner shows, from the figures of the Mu
nicipal Year Book, a profit on the public ownership
of street railroads in Great Britain of $1,405,876.
Piofit on what? What is the capital borrowed?
What rate of interest does it bear, and what increase
in taxation does it cause?
The Royal Statistical Society of Great Britain, to
whose reports one must resort for accurate statistics,
shows for five years an average net profit on muni
cipal railways of only one-half of one per cent,
allowing oniy one-eighth of one per cent for depre
ciation. An expert actuary makes returns for thirty-,
five English towns that operate street railways, and
in twenty-one of these no provision is made for de
preciation, and no repair and betterment fund is put
aside.
Redwood is steadily gaining in popularity in the
Atlantic States. A company with capital of $1,000,000
has recently been formed in this city,' including
the head men of all the leading redwood companies in
California, . with great holdings of timber lands, for
the purpose of extending the American market for
California's unique wood. A large plant for hand
ling the lumber will be. erected at Antioch, and it is
proposed to ; there maintain" a" supply of between
20,000,000 and 30,000,000,/feet for Eastern shipment.
The plant is j estimated/ to cost nearly $1,000,000.
Distributing jagencies will be established in large
cities. It is necessary, to add- to facilities for produc
ing the marketable article. Recently the local de-Â»
mand has been up to; the supply. The Eastern mar
ket has made ; demands that' must be met.
Look. in any direction that they may, the owners
of redwood timber are -in a position to see bright
visions. The unparalleled growth of San Erancisco
has made it pecessary to provide vast quantities of
building material for use here. While business
blocks and" hotels, are more largely constructed
of steel and brick and stone than formerly, the great
array of apartment houses, family hotels and resi
dences that' will be needed to accommodate the
growing population' of this and other cities will keep
mills busy oni large orders. The signs in the East
and in England have been outlined.
ing the total for the year 3,138,000 feet, valued at
Â§65,172. / 1
These indications of growth in the foreign demand
are cheering. Th,e money received for the cargoes
will be expended in California and largely in Hum
boldt County. The Standard says that'the'eounties
of Humboldt, Mendocino and Del Norte alone "can
cut 800,000,000 feet of redwood each year, and the
last year in the century will. see as large a cut as the
first."

Russia, it is announced, is somewhat disturbed
over the military and naval activity of .Japan and
views, with suspicion the mobilization of troops in
Korea. If Russia is disturbed at this demonstration
it would be interesting to know how to characterize

IT is pleasing to learn from the Humboldt Stan
dard that there is a marked increase in the Eng

by the shipments from the port of Eureka during, the
first ten months of the present year. Five fully laden
vessels have sailed from Humboldt Bay for England,
carrying out cargoes valued in the aggregate at $104,-.

A FEW days ago a famous and stunning beauty abruptly termina-
ted her own wedding ceremony by refusing to xeneat the word
"Obey" after the officiating clergyman. In consequence she
- is -tilr unmarried and her action has set the East by the ear3. In
the discussion pro and con (and it is truly remarkable what stand
the women have taken) Father John Talbot Smith of the Catholic
church was -appealed to. He has, given his dictum in no uncertain words.
"To tell the truth." he said, "I do not think it is a practical ques-
tion at all. this one of eliminating the word obey. It is in the nature of
things that the man should command and woman should obey, no mat-
ter how many statutory provisions you make, simply because a man likes
to command and a woman likes to obey.
"What is the use of statutes against a natural proclivity or condition?
You can see the wisdom of the church in omitting this word from its
ritual.
â¢*A woman who refuses to obey might please her fancy by the mere
declination to follow a custom, yet she might be the quickest to obey
her husband.
"That is where nature is stronger than ideas. Ideas may become
fads, existing f r a short while, but nature goes right on. r
.."1 notice that men are glad to get the women they want to marrv
and the women are equally glad to marry, obey or not, regardless of all
fads and fancies."
There are so many who differ with the reverend father that what
they have to say'forms one of the most interesting pages in the next
Sunday Call.
It is almost that very same quality of circumstance that forms the
t,heme of Robert Barr's great romantic story, "The King Investigates,"
and by perhaps a strange coincidence the problem is solved in a novel
way in the fourth and last installment of E. W. Townsend's latest and
best novel, "Lees and Leaven." which- will appear next Sunday. The
famous creator of "Chimmie Fadden" has made a big sensation since ap-
pearing as a writer in the Sunday Call.
Then there is a page of "Half-Hour Storiettes," which treats the
problem* from quite a different point of view. There you have four of
the cleverest and most touching romances ever written. "The Voice and
the Violin" especially and "The Grammar of Love" as well, which is a
story that you will never forget.
Then there is one of Frank H. Spearman's wonderful two-oaec
railroad stories. "De Molay Four," which, if you read it (and of course
you will), will constantly recur to your mind with a strange thrill every
time you see the moon. Why? Because Frank H. Spearman wrote it
and the moon wouldn't be in it if it were not dramatic.
And now harken to a few other special features, which can only be
mentioned in brief because there are so many good things in the next
Sunday Call. *

displayed at the league's exhibition at
the Palace Hotel. He gave Howard a
check for $100, and at Howard's sugges
tion made it payable to "John Hay," who.
Howard paid, was the treasurer of the
league. The check was indorsed "John

Colonel Beck Testifies.
The brief exhibits much legal researeS
and judicial reasoning. United States
Immigrant Commissioner North has
mailed the protest and brief to Secretary;
Ccrtelyou.
United States Immigrant ComxnlssSsner
Hart H. North was served yesterday with
a protest from tho Oceanic Steamship
Company against the payment of J3 per
capita tax or deposit on alien passenger*
in transit through the United State*. Tha
protest covers passengers that arrive at
this port by tbe Oceania lino from. Syd
ney, N. S. W., and way ports. ThÂ«
grounds of the protest are that, under
section 1 of the immigration- act, passen
gers in transit through tho United States
for a foreign country are exempt front
the payment of a head tax. and that thÂ«
act does not authorize tho Immigration
officers to make any demand of tho alien
transit passettger. nor of tho owners or
agents of the vessel bringing 1 them, for
such, or any other payment on such tran
sit passengers. The protest complains
that in many Instances the money so paid
has not been refunded after positive proof
had been produced at this port that tha
transit passenger had left the United
States long before the thirty days after
landing at this port had expired. Th*
point is made that It la tbe duty of tha
immigration officers to . ascertain by the
passengers' through tickets or other evi
dence which passengers are In transit and
which are not. Tha protestant asks that
the matter be- referred to the United
States Attorney General for his opinion.
Accompanying the protest is an ex
haustive brief, written by W. Ford
Thomas, customs representative of the
company, in which several court decisions
are cited as sustaining his contention that
the action of the immigration ofncials vir
tually amounts to an amendment of the
act of Congress and for that reason Is
illegal and void. For Instance, In tbe case
of the United States against Burko tha
court said:
"The legislation contained in thÂ» various
statutes that have been passed relating to
Immigration is clearly directed against tha
Immigration of certain classes of persons who
come In with Intent to enter Into and becom*

tlon."
Mr. Thomas raises tho point that rule
IS of the department imposing the head
tax upon passengers in transit is void,
as being in excess of the law, and quotes
from the case of Anchor vs. Howe tho
following remark of the court:
"It has been frequently held by the
Supreme and other United States courts
that regulations in conflict with the taw arÂ«
Invalid; those which enlarge its requirements,
though not In exact conflict with or contra
diction of It, should be likewise regarded."
Mr. Thomas continues:
The law. In effect, levies a head tax on cer
tain immlirrants and in the same breath and
in clearest phrase provides that said head tax
shall not be levied upon aliens in transit.
Such payment is called a deposit by the rule,
but if it is a lawful collection It Is a head
tax. for only a head tax. may be collected un
der the hw. If It is not a head tax It la ex
tortion, \>lracy; and the piracy Is none the
less mitigated by the promise to refund the
so-called deposit upon proof presented withla
thirty (leys after landing 1 that the exempt
alien has passed out of the United States, for
If the Government is not entitled to the $3
absolutely it Is not entitled to It at all. It
Is not entitled to possession depending: upon
unlawful force for one lota of time. When the
deposit is collected it is from a class exempt
under the law. It Is the duty of thÂ« Immi
gration ofncials to determine tho status of
every passenger In order that the proper head
tax may bÂ« collected. This duty should bÂ«
so performed that there would be no contin
gent list subject to deposit; that the head
tax may be collected as to the passengers
liable therefor and not collected from thosa
not liable. It Is as much a duty to determine
and establish the status of exemption as It is
to determine and establish the status of lia
bility. There is no law requiring; a deposit
relative to passengers exempt. As well might
the Collector require a deposit of $G pÂ«r pound
upon an Importation of coffee on the ground
that possibly the coftew might be prepared

might be refunded upon satisfactory proof that
the coffee was really coffee and not prepared,

The board referred the petition of the
Union Oil Company for permission to
maintain a spur track on Illinois street
south from Sixteenth to the City 'Engi
neer for investigation. Inspector of Com
plaints Griffin reported that the spur
track^ together with pipe lines, had al
ready been laid at great expense and
without any knowledge of the law or that
a provision of a franchise granted the
Santa Fe Railroad Company for the use
of the street.
The board awarded the contract for flues
and chimneys in the Noe Valley School
building to Archibald W. Murphy for $350.
The Board of Puhllc "Works yesterday
decided to transmit a formal request to
City Attorney Lane to prepare an amend
ment to the charter so that progressive
payments may be made on public con
tracts. Commissioners Manson. Casey and
Schmitx were of the opinion that the pro
posed amendment is necessary.
As the charter stands any contractor
who bids for work is obliged to wait
until he completes it before he receives
his money. This works well with small
contracts, but in those of greater mag
nitude the effect of the charter provision
is to exclude small contractors from bid
ding.
Tho proposed new sewer system for
which bonds will be Issued was discussed
by the board. It was stated that some
of the contracts for the system will foot
up as high as $400,000, and under the
charter provisions that the work shall
not bo paid for until completed but one
or two contractors would be able to un
dertake such a contract. Even then it
is doubtful whether they would bid if
they had to wait for such a large amount.
It is thought that interest on the outlay
made by the contractor might be included
in the bid and the price of the work would
bo materially raised In that way.
Commissioner Schmitz was emphatic in
his advocacy of a charter amendment
permitting progressive payments. He
called attention to the fact that the
amendment was submitted to the^people
at a recent election, but It failed to carry
because It was saddled with other amend
ments considered objectionable. It Is the
desire of the commission that the plan
in use by the Federal and State govern
ments for progressive payments on con
tracts should be followed in the main.

No Trace of Pillsbury.
Although tbe police and the officials of
the Santa Fe road are still diligently
searching for a clew that may reveal the
whereabouts of Frank Pillsbury, the em
ploye of the company who mysteriously
disappeared last Friday afternoon, their
efforts have so far been fruitless. W. J.
Shattuck, a former clerk of the Santa Fe
Company, reported yesterday that he saw
Pillsbury in Sacramento on Saturday, and
another man named Mayer informed the
railroad representatives that he is certain
that Pillsbury was aboard the ferry-boat
bound for this city at*l o'clock 8unday.
A telegraphic inquiry eent to Sacramento
yesterday, however, brought the response
that the missing clerk could not be found
there and had not been seen by those
who know him. Pillsbury's friends in
this city fear that he has made away
with himself.

Beveral buildings in the east end were
Shaken considerably, among them being
the five-etory building of the Union Pa

walls rf the shep building were being
made ready for the roof and were thought
to be substantial. The heavy wind, how
ever, crushed them in, causing a complete
wreck.
The iniured men were removed to a

In speaking about the standard bearer
he said: , .
I want you to remember tbe - head of oui
IMPROVE THE CITY.
Now I don't Dlay any lone hand on this
ticket. I want to go In with the whole
crowd. I want every man whose name Is on
the ticket I represent to have a seat in th<s
City Hall, where he can welcome his friends.
I want him to be there as the best public
official that the Republican party can give
to the voters of San Francisco. 1 think that
every man who has Indorsed the platform, of
the Republican party Is a man who will' do
his duty by the people of San Francisco, with
out respect to any creed or class or without
any desire of favoring any one.
Wt are going to have a chance to Improve
this city and we are going to have a chance to
Improve the city in its entirety. We ere
going to have better streets, sewers, public
parks, as there has been a large sum allotted
for that purpose, and It will make San Fran
cisco a city to be proud of.
. I don't want to repeat myself, but I said
the other night I want to see the workingmen
get every dollar of the bond Issue they are
entitled to and I want to see you taxpayers
and citizens sret all tho results that will ac
crue. I don't make much of a speech, but I
pledge you my word I have no desire to do
anything as Mayor that won't redound to the
credit of Henry J. Crocker as Mayor and re
dound to the. credit of San Francisco as the
best-governed cltr in the Union. (Great rp
plause.)
George Dletterle, candidate for Super
visor, spoke at length on the qualifications
of the men on the ticket. . He praised
Treasurer McDougald, Tax E.
J. Smith and Auditor-Harry Baehr, who
he said were entitled to re-election, as
they had conducted their offices in an
honorable and economical manner. He
appealed to the voters to stand by the
ticket. , S^-V;
under the auspices of the H.
J. Crocker^Club of the Thirty-first Dis
trict. It was the first of its kind attend
ed by Mr. Crocker and he was greatly
pleased with his reception. When he en
tered the hall he was given hearty cheers.
His speech was a simple one and he was
given the closest attention during Its de
livery. In the absence of Jeremiah O.
Shea, president of the organization, Wil
liam J. Bell, the secretary, presided and
introduced the various speakers who ad
dressed the voters of the district. In the
course of his address the Republican
standard bearer said:
I am not much of a speechmaker, but I can
certainly say something that comes from my
heart. I am here to-night In response to a
call that was made some time before I was
given the nomination. Some of the boys from
this district came down to my office and said:
"Henry, we are going to run you for office
and we want you to get out among us aÂ»
eoon as j'ou are nominated." I said: "Gen
tlemen, I have not had the pleasure of being
approached by any member of the commit
tee who Is seeking a candidate," and they
said: "The people are going to nominate you
for Mayor and they are going to elect you."
(Cries of "You bet they will," and applause.)
Now the night of my nomination I met some
of the gentlemen from this district, among
them a man who is known not to be energetic,
but Is generally around when the bell rings
(laughter), and he said: "I have a hall en
gaged and I want you to name the night.
Don't make any engagements." I told him
there and then that the first time I appeared
In public It would be at his beck' and call. Un
fortunately they got up another meeting and I
appeared t her *t DUt It wa * ' n m >* heart to
do what I told Mr. Bell, and I therefore takÂ«
the first opportunity to make good my promise.
But you are not Interested in that.
HENRY J. CROCKER, the Re
publican candidate for Mayor,
addressed an enthusiastic
meeting In Eintracht Hall last
night. The meeting was held
Other speakers addressed the meeting.
Candidates told their fitness- for office.
During the evening music was furnished
by young residents of the district and re
freshments were served. -The initial meet
ing of -the: Henry J. Crocker Club was a
great success. Mr. Crocker made many
friends by meeting the members person
ally. -V^^c ?>~;'c;-: ' .
Resolved, That this club elect delegates to
meet the delegates of the various Assembly
districts on" Saturday evening, October 10, . at
8 o'clock, at 739 Market street, for the pur
pose of organizing the Crocker League of
Clubs. v T^-
Resolved, That said clubs shall Have a cen
tral organization composed of one delegate to
each fifty bona fide members on said club rolls;
further '.
William H. McCarthy presented the fol
lowing resolution, which was adopted by
a unanimous vqte:
Resolved, That we, the members of the
Thirty-first Assembly District H. J. Crocker
Club, in body assembled, proceed to organize in
each of the various Assembly districts of tho
city and county of San Francisco clubs to
be known as the Crocker League of Clubs.
Said clubs shall be composed of the support
ers of the Hon. H. J. Crocker, our standard
bearer for Mayor, of the city and county of
San Francisco.
I am like the smnll boy who follows the
great man â I am at Crocker's coattalls during
this campaign. He represents each and every
Interest In the city and county of San Fan
clsco. Tbe newspapers of the entire State
have been clamoring for years for a greater
San Francisco. The opportunity Is before you.
We can well appreciate the fact that each
one of you here Is a friend of Henry J. Crock
er. What we ask of you Is to get In the band
wagon. We aek you to get five votes and in
turn ask five more to vote for Crocker. We
need Crocker. We want Crocker. We know
if we have Crocker we will be properly repre
sented. (Applause.)
He was introduced and was given a
warm greeting. In part he said:
Milton Esberg, who is a member of the
campaign committee and has been doing
yeoman work in behalf of the United Re
publican League, has taken up the task
of bringing about the success of the Re
publican ticket. He accompanied Mr.
Crocker on his rounds last night and will
do so throughout the campaign.
GREATER SAN FRANCISCO.
While awaiting the arrival of Mr.
Crocker the time was taken up by E. M.
Ritter, a member of the campaign com
mittee, who explained the issues to those
present. Mr. Ritter made a fervent ap
peal for the election of the entire tick
et. In speaking for the standard bearer
he said:
I appeal to the voters to elect a man who will
take care of the Immense sum voted for public
Improvements. I believe tho head of the Repub
lican ticket is one of the finest, grandest men in
California. He has been identified with the In
terests of this State for many years. He Is
a man, Kentlemen, whom you can depend upon.
I warrant the opposition has tested him on
every point; has figured Into his past and they
have watched him and looked him through and
through, and to-day they have found not a
single thing against him. He Is a man. He
is a man whose paat recommends his future.
He has been successful In business and is the
kind of man we want to put at the head of
our municipal covernment, because he knows
how to transact the business of the city. Ap

remember him on November 3.
Republican Standard -Bearer Creates Fine
Impression Among the Laboring
Classes.
The assertion- is freely made In the
guilds of labor that Mayor Schmitz is the
creature of Ruef and Parry. The small
vote cast at the recent primary election
by the Union Labor party is accepted as
proof of the lack of enthusiasm for the
Mayor in the ranks of his own party.
The Republican ratification meeting at
the Alhambra Theater next Saturday
night is engaging the attention of tho
candidates and the campaign committee.
All citizens, irrespective of party affilia
tion, will be unwelcome, as the candidacy
of Mr. Crocker represents the ' spirit of
progress in San Francisco. All voters de
siring the expansion and development of
the city on true lines of greatness are in
vited to support the Republican nominees.
CREATURE OF RUEP.
The popularity of Henry J. Crocker la
everywhere demonstrated. The business
men, workingmen and taxpayers general
ly hail him as the next Mayor of San
Francisco. The candidate takes the reins
of leadership in an easy, graceful style.
He is alert and affable and has many per
sonal friends and old acquaintances in
every section of the city. He is not ac
claimed as an orator who parades the
town with a vocabulary of high-soundlns
phrases, but Is simply greeted as a square
and capable business man who is familiar
with the management of large affairs.
When it comes to giving the campaign
glad hand to every one along the line
Henry Crocker is not outclassed by that
prince of glad-handers, Julius Kahn.
Everywhere the remark is made. "The
fight is between Crocker and Schmilz."
The fact is so obvious that it does not es
cape the notice of delegates to the recont
McNab convention. Mayor Schmitz's ef
forts to create a class Issue are unavail
ing. The Republican organization com
mittee has positive assurance that many
labor union men who voted for Mr.
Schmitz in 1901 have resolved to vote for
Mr. Crocker at the next tlectlon.
CBOCKEB'S POPULARITY.
same place last night a confer
ence of the campaign committee and the
candidates on the Republican ticket took
place. Views regarding the contest were
freely expressed. There is not the slight
est feeling of despondency or doubt in the
Republican camp. District workers send
word to the central organization that the
people are predicting the election of Hen
ry J. Crocker to the office of Mayor and
also predicting the success of the entire
Republican ticket. Party leaders are
warning the club workers of the darger
of overconfldence, telling them that thÂ«
bright prospects of victory should not
cause relaxation of work.

damage was done. In Greenwood and
Coffey counties five distinct funnel shaped
clouds formed at about the same time.
The two largest cf these clouds struck
near Aliceville and, traveling southwest,
destroyed buildings and crops over a strip
a Quarter of a. mile in width. At Alice
vine every one of the fifty houses in the
town was either totally wrecked or moved
from its foundation. The two general
merchandise stores there, one owned by
T. C. Jones and the other belonging to
D. R. Grant, were totally wrecked and
the entire contents destroyed.
On the opposite side of the street two
blacksmith shoi>s, a lumber yard, the
Methodist church and the Missouri Pa
eiflc depot were demolished. At Alice
ville but one person, William Bruce, was
seriously hurt. He was crushed by fall
ing timbers and probably will die. South

damage was done to farming property.
The farm house of John Earlwlne was
torn to pieces and four members of the
family injured, tut none dangerously. A

It will be necessary to have the inves
tigation made by a man who is familiar
Â¦with the manner of shipping California
fruit and all the details of the business.
He will need to have pertinacity and also
skill in finding out what Is concealed as
as it can be by Interested middle
men. He must be familiar with fruit val
ues, that he may be able to form a com
petent Judgment in the markets. He will
be sent, undoubtedly, to New York, Chi
cago, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Boston,
in Ehort, to all places where large quan
tities of California fruit are marketed.
The investigation ought to result in
bringing to light much that will be of
value in guiding the fruit growers of Cal
ifornia in their future dealings.
Years ago, at the beginning of the mar
keting of California raisins in the East,
Arthur B. R. Briggs. the present man
ager of the State Board of Trade, went
to Chicago and there discovered that the
commission men were treating the raisin
growers about as the deciduous fruit
raisers have since been served. A report
was made and the raisin men acted
promptly in their own behalf. Since then
the raisin men have organized and they
ship no goods on commission. On the
contrary, they make actual sales and re
ceive checks before the goods are deliv
ered.
SKILLFUL MAN NEEDED.
The resolution adopted Tuesday after
noon at the monthly meeting of the State
Board of Trade 13 as follows:
Resolved, That the manager of this board
be instructed to report to the board the prac
ticability of Instituting a general Inquiry Into
the fruit market, foreign and domestic, with
reference to an ascertainment of all the facts
relating to such market, and especially with
reference to the relation between the amount
returned from tbe reported sales of fruit and
tha actual amount obtained from euch sales;
and further, to the end that the price paid to
tha fruit crower of this State shH41 more
nearly correspond to the price at which the
fruit product of California reaches the con
sumer; and that the manager is requested to
report to thÂ« board, at its next meeting, the
practicability and cost of such inquiry.
The Board of Trade has sufflcient
money on hand to pay for the cervices
and expenses of a competent man for this
important mission. At the meeting of
Tuesday a balance of good size was re
ported to bÂ« on hand. There is little
doubt that Manager Briggs will report
that the investigation is feasible. Indeed,
he says there Is no doubt of its feasibil
ity. His principal duty in the premises
will be to Inquire into the cost. He will
set about this without delay.
RESOLUTION ADOPTED.
In view of the surpassing importance of
this matter great care will be exercised,
so says Manager Arthur R. Briggs of the
State Board of Trade, in selecting the
man who will go East to find out for the
fruit men all the facts.
The investigation into tho methods of
selling California fruit in the Easfern
market that Is proposed by the California
State Board of TradÂ© Is likely to have
wide scope. No such investigation has
ever been made in behalf of the whole
fruit industry of this State. Between the
sums that the growers ought to receive
annually and tho amounts they actually
pet for their fruit there Is a difference
that amounts to many thousands of dol
lars. Every fruit grower in the State is
pecuniarily Interested in the outcome of.
the search for truth in this direction.
What has been suspected to be the evil
practices of many who make money as
middlemen in handling- the output of Cal
ifornia orchards and vineyards will either
stand revealed in the full glare of day
light or Will be proved not to exist.

The regular dally baseball burlesque
was handed out at Recreation Park again
yesterday afternoon and of course It
ended the same way. The native talent
was lucky to make a run in the first in
ning. After that nothing doing. The
southern club wielders never even tried
hard, yet they rolled up an even dozen.
Newton was passing out the curves lor
the Angels. He proved a trifle more ef
fective than usual. . He started off a lit
tle wild and passed Shay and Leahy in
the first inning. Shay stole second and
made the only run for Uncle Hank on an
out by Pabst. Not another of the na
tives had a chance to make good after
that.
Hodson srot an awful beating all the
way through. Errors started it and then
the little pitcher was no good against the
\ Giants. They hit him when they pleased
and if they desired to try a little they
could In all probability have made a hun
dred runs. The score:

Still Searching for Paulsen.
REDDING, Oct. 7.â The Native Sons'
parlor at Weaverville, of which Harry
Paulsen was. a member, has taken charge
of the search being made for him. He
has been missing from Weaverville since
the 2Sth of September. A discovery has
just been made, however, that strength
ens the belief that ' Paulsen committed
suicide. He always wore three rings,
rarely if ever taking them from his fin
ger. The rings have just been found in
the till beneath the counter in the bar
room and in which Paulsen kept his keys.
The finding of the rings leads to the be
lief that Paulsen's suicide was planned
some time before and that he left his
rings so that they would be found, possi
bly realizing that his body might never
be discovered.

POLICE QUELL RIOT .
ON TELEGRAPH HILL
Quarry Laborers Are Attacked From
Ambush and a Fierce Battle
Results.
A squad of patrolmen from the Central
police station had a fight yesterday aft
ernoon on Telegraph Hill. A battle broke
out between the laborers in a quarry at
Lombard and Montgomery streets and
some unknown persons and during its
progress C. H. Lorenzo, a laborer, was hit
in the head with a rock and painfully
hurt.
The fight is supposed to have been
started by several union men who
thought that those employed in the
quarry were non-union laborers. The
workmen were attacked from I ambush
with stones and other missiles and when
the police arrived on the scene the battle
was raging at Its height. No arrests were
made, the mob being dispersed after a
sharp fight.
Tug-of-War Contests.
The results of last night's tug-of-war
contests were: Laborers beat bricklay
ers by default, carpenters beat bridge
workers in five minutes, cement workers
beat carmen in ten minutes, plasterers
beat horseshoers in twenty minutes,
teamsters beat plumbers in twenty min
utes. For to-morrow night the manage
ment has arranged a pull that will bring
out the strongest kind of partisan feel
ing. In the early part of the first week
the bricklayers and the plumbers held on
to the hawser for fifty-three minutes and
after a nip and tuck struggle were or
dered to quit by the referee, who declared
the go a draw. A special prize has been
donated and the te^ms will make another
effort to decide which of them is en
titled to honors.

BERKELEY, Oct. 7.â The training ta
ble for the football squad at the Uni
versity .of California will be established
next Monday. Fifteen men will be se
lected from among those now in training
and kept there until the intercollegiate
game against Stanford on November 14.
The schedule of games for next Satur
day has been changed by the managers
of the varsity teams. Instead of Stan
ford playing the Fort Baker soldiers on
the Berkeley campus and California play
ing Reliance at Stanford, Stanford will
play the Naval School eleven at Stanford
and California the Reliance team at
Berkeley. This change was made neces
sary on account of the engagement of
the soldiers to play another game. The
exchange of campuses by the varsity
teams will be made next Wednesday, al
though the teams to meet them have not
yet been selected.

Detective Thomas Ryan was detailed
on It and his report exonerated any out
side person from culpability in the mat
ter. The husband willingly told all he
knew about the case and his statements
were verified by several disinterested per-'
sons. He s=ld that his wife had been a
slave to liquor for a long time." In the
present instance she had been drinking
heavily for three weeks past. The bruises
on her body and face resulted from num
erous falls she had sustained while under
the influence of liciuor.
The result of the autopsy performed by
Dr. Bacigalupl on the body of Mrs. Dol
lle Wissing, who was found dead in her
lodgings at 561 Mission street Tuesday
night, developed the fact that she had
tiled of rupture of ' the hepatic artery,
caused by external violence, and for a
time yesterday it was thought the wom
an might have been murdered. A thor
ough investigation by the police speedily
dissipated that suspicion.
The dead woman's husband is a steve
dore. When he returned from work Tues
day night he discovered his wife lifeless
in the bedroom. She was seated on the
floor with her back against the bed. He
tried to lift her to her feet and finding
she was dead, gave the alarm. Police
rren Kruger and Foley responded ' and
notified the Coroner's office.
Deputy Coroner Meehan made an inves
tigation and decided that death had been
due to cirrhosis of the liver. The subse
quent discovery of the autopsy surgeon
that the woman had bled to death from
rupture of the hepatic artery and that
her bedy bore the marks of several se
vere bruises set the police to work on
the case.
Police Discover That Mrs. Dollie
Wissing Died of Purely Nat

THEORY OF WOMAN'S
MURDER IS DISPELLED
The Interchange of games whereby
Berkeley was to play Reliance on the
Stanford campus next Saturday and Stan
ford was to meet the naval apprentices
on the Berkeley gridiron on the same day
has been postponed until Wednesday or
Thursday of next week. On Saturday the
varsity will play the Pensacola team on
the campus. It Is probable that the fresh
men will play the Palo Alta team again
on Friday afternoon. On next Tuesday
a game is scheduled between the fresh
men and the Santa Clara College eleven
to take place on the Stanford gridiron.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 7 â
The freshman football team added an
other to Its straight record of defeats
this afternoon when It went down be
fore the Palo Alto Athletic Club elevi-n
by he score of 6 to 5. With the exception
of the two runs that scored the touch
downs for the rival teams, the game was
as lifeless and uninteresting an exhibition
as has ever been seen on the campus
gridiron.
During the game to-day the best play
ers in the '07 class were tried out. yet
their showing would not have reflected
credit on a good "prep" school team. Un
less a remarkable improvement is made
by the youngsters within the l.ext ten
days, the Berkeley freshmen will prob
ably find them the easiest opponents
they have had this season.
The features of the game were a sprint
of fifty yards to a touchdown by Stagner,
the freshman quarterback, in the first
half and a run by Fullback Swain of Palo
Alto of 105 yards, from the Palo Alto
five-yard line to the ' freshman goal.
Swain's remarkable feat came at the be
ginning of the second half, when he re
ceived the kick-off from Freshman Dole.
Swain skirted the side-line next to the
bleachers for the length of the field, al
most without any interference to resist
him. The freshmen seemed unable to
tackle him.
Treasurer David V. Cowden of the As
sociated Students has announced a series
of football games to be played on the
campus within a week. Two contests will
be arranged for the varsity and two for
the freshman eleven.

The'third amendment increases* the dues
of absent members from Jl to $2 50 per
month, the latter amount being one-half
the regular dues. Abuses have developed
and It is,.to correct these the change has
been suggested.
The second amendment raises the Initia
tion fee from $23 to $50. The former Is
held to be out of proportion to the club's 1
assets.
A mail vote of the club members is be
ing taken on three Important questions.
The first is to raise the membership limit
from 1500 to 1730. There Is always a long
waiting list and also a long list of ab
sentees. The monthly average of the lat
ter Is 125. These members pay but $1 per
month at present, making an appreciable
loss of revenue. It Is to offset this and
to reduce the waiting list that the change
Is suggested.
T. I. Fitzpatrick and Victor Cagiieri will
meet in a fifty-yard dash. C. duff and
Walter Young will swim 220 yards, while
Fred Sherry, S. Herrlck and F. Gellnaa
will compete over a quarter-mile course.

for two yards of topaz, cut and roped at
her order by F. A. Marcher of the Pacific
Gem Company. Last spring when the
beautiful Mrs. Tevis flitted through this
city she conceived the idea of possessing
a string of gems and sought out Marcher,
who had Just what she wished. She had
a Fix-foot string of diamonds linked with
gold, and she wanted the topaz to wear
on occasions when the diamonds might be
endangered. She ordered 150 stones to be
linked with platinum at a cost not to ex
ceed $7uG and shipped to Knoxville, Tenn.
The string was eent in April and returned
a month afterward by Mrs. Tevis, her
only comment being that she did not like
the ornament as well as she thought she
would. Marcher was incensed and sent
it back to the lady with a demand for
immediate remittance. Mrs. Tevis re
sponded by returning the ornament and
suggesting, it Is alleged, that Marcher
sing for his money. The gems are now
held by Wells-Fargo, subject to Mrs.
Tevis' order. So Marcher goes to court.

FRESNO. Oct. 7.â Deputy Sheriff Wal

tx-ing crushed to death on a mountain
trestle at Millwood yesterday. He was
hurulnjr for a witness and had started out
from the lower to the upper of the San
gtr Lumber Company's properties on the
railroad track. The cars on this track
are drawn \ip by a cable, but come down
by their own momentum. Pickett was
crcsdng a trestle over a gorge when he
heard a noise ahead of him and looking
v.p saw a train cf three heavily loaded
cars rushing toward him at a speed of a
irlle a minute. He had no time to run
back to Faf<~-ty, and it was forty feet to
the bottom of the gorge. There was but
one chance and Pickett took it. He
dropped fiat upon one of the trestle logs
end hung to it for life, the cars sweeping
past him in an Instant. He was so close
that the -wheels brushed his coat and he
came very near flipping off the log into
the porge below, but maintained his
strength till the cars got by. when, weak
snd trembling, he drew himself up to
eaftty.
NARROWLY ESCAPES DEATH
â¢ ON A MOUNTAIN TRESTLE
Rats, which honeycombed the dam with
their holes, are thought to be 'responsible
for the going out of the dam.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 7.â The dam at
the head of the Government canal, ex
tending from Lake Union to the waters
of the Sound, went out this morning, and
all day and to-night a river 75 to 100 feet
wide and ten or twelve feet deep has been
racing through the ditch.
While the catastrophe was spectacular
in the extreme, the damage is small. No
private property is affected, except that
the earth is washed away from beneath
the shore ends of three bridges, two be
longing to the city and one to the Seattle
Electric Company. The bridges were not
weakened, although as a precautionary
measure traffic over them was stopped.
A temporary dam will be thrown across
the canal to-morrow, and the wing dam
will then be rebuilt.
The damage, including the cost of re
building the wing dam and the temporary
dam, will amount to less than $1000 to the
Government. The city will escape with
about $300, and the electric company with
but little more.

j PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 7.â At a meeting
I of the freight bureau of the North Pacific
j Asiatic Steamship lines, held in Seattle,
j the rate on flour from Portland and Puget
{ Sound ports has been raised from $3 to
i 55 per ton. The rate on wheat and all
] other commodities hastbeen raised in a
I corresponding ratio. The new tariff will
I go into effect on November L
The rate war, which has prevailed for
. several months, was precipitated by the
! China Commercial Company, operating a
i line from San Francisco to the Orient.
j The rate on flour to the Orient from San
I Francisco was cut to $1 per ton, but the
j northern lines never made a lower rate
than $3 per ton.
The determination to increase the rates,
it is asserted, will have an important
! bearing upon the locai wheat market.
j Japanese importers took advantage of the
: rate war to secure large quantities of
I flour, presumably for speculative pur
j poses. All the mills in Oregon and Wash
j lngton have been kept running to their
i full capacity to supply the demand. They
; had agents through the Inland empire
gathering up all the wheat that could be
j secured for immediate delivery. As a
i consequence the price of wheat began to
j rise and many farmers refused to sell.
' Exporters who were anxious to send
! cargoes to Europe were unable to buy
! wheat for export at the prevailing- prices,
I and as a result there have been practical
Â¦ ly no ships chartered to load, for Euro
â¢ pean ports.
It is now believed, however, that there
j will be a change in the situation.

SENSATION IS DIVORCED
In conclusion. Chamberlain said that he
trusted the people in this matter. He had
been told that he was risking his politi
cal life, but he had risked it before, and
he had no fear for the personal result.
Concluding his general restatement,
the speaker said that agriculture In
Great Britain was practically destroyed,
the sugar trade gone, the silk trade was
gone, the iron and wool industries were
threatened, and the same fate would
come to the cotton trade. He continued:
How long are you going to stan.l it? Eng
land is not afraid of foreign countries. She
la the greatest market in the whole world,
and foreign countries are her best customer*.
If a tariff war came England would not com*
out Â»econd tx?st. One reason advanced for
America's prosperity is her enormous popula
tion of seventy millions, but the British em
pire has sixty millions, all white, and somÂ«
330,000,000 of other races, all prospective cus
tomers of the mother country.
Asking why the foreign productive
countries, even small nations like Sweden,
had all prospered, he said that he be
lieved they were better strategists. He
continued:
I say that you are inconsistent. You are
adopting; a suicidal course. If you o*rsist in
the prenent policy your workmen must either
lake lower waxes or lose their work.
The late Colonial Secretary said that
he was a free trader and wanted to live
harmoniously with his neighbors, but he
desired free exchange with all nations.
If they would not exchange, he was not
a free trader at any price. He respected
"our American cousins," had consider
able respect for the Germans, and great
respect and greater friendship for tha
French. The policy of these nations wa*
to use the tariffs to ease the home trade
and exclude foreign trade, while undeT
the present system in the United King
dom trade was steadily decreasing.
Chamberlain asked why all protective
nations prospered more than the unpro
tected ones. If the Cobdenites would sat
isfactorily answer that question, ha
would ask to be allowed to hide his di
minished head. His occupation would bÂ«
gone.
LONDON, Oct. 7.â Continuing his fiscal
campaign. Chamberlain to-night ad
dressed a meeting of four thousand per
sons In the Town Hall of Greenock. a
seaport on the Clyde, twenty-two miles
from Glasgow. He spoke for one hour
and a quarter and dealt particularly with
the questions of retaliation and recipro
city.
Captain of Police Petersen and Detec
tives Holland and Kyte repeated their
former testimony in regard to Mrs. Ross*
confession. The case was continued until
to-morrow morning.
Annie Ross, the white woman accused
of being an accomplice of Victor Walkl
rez, the negro murderer of aged Eliza
beth Leroy, was given a preliminary hear
ing to-day before Judge Samuels.
Walklrez, who Is serving a life Benterce,
was brought over from San Quentin and
placed on the stand. His recitation of
the facts concerning the murder occupied
most of the day.
The murderer, who at the time of his
conviction confessed that he killed Mrs.
Leroy with a hammer and buried h=Â»r
body, now denies that he did the crime he
is serving time for, and says he merely
testified as he did to save the woman who
was living with him. He- claims that ev
erything he said during his trial was
what Mrs. Ross had told him to say.
Walkirez gave his testimony in a low,
feeble voice and appeared to have a much
weakened mind, for his memory was bad.
He stated that on May 5 when he came
home in the afternoon Mrs. Ross
asked him to get some "dope" and kill the
old woman bo that they could get her
money. He claims that he refused to do
as she asked, and went to bed. Early the
next morning, about 4 o'clock, he was
awakened by Mrs. Ross, who told blm
that he had killed Mrs. Leroy and he
must go downstairs and bury her. Walkl
rez did not remember having* done the
deed, but went downstairs and found the
corpse of Mrs. Leroy wrapped in quilts
standing against a big dry goods box.
Under Mrs. Robs' direction he buried the
body, but did not search the clothes for
money, as Mrs. Ross wanted him to. The
witness stated that all of his confession,
made at the time of his conviction, was
Invented and rehearsed to him by Mrs.
Ross. He said that she had told him that
he would be convicted and hanged and
that there was no use of his bringing her
into it. The negro's memory was hazy in
regard to many facts of the murder.
Several letters were produced, written
to Walkirez by Mrs. Ross at the time of
his Incarceration at the City Prison. The
tenor of all was that Walktrez ought not
to tell anything on her that would In
criminate her.

People have no idea how
crude and cnuel soap can be.
It takes off dirt. So far,
so good; but what else does
it do.
It cuts the skin and frets
the under-skin; makes red-
ness . and roughness and
leads to worse. Not soap,
but the alkali in it.
Pears' Soap has no free, al-
kali in it. It neither reddens
nor roughens the skin. It re-
sponds to water instantly; wash-

as gentle as strong; and the
after-effect is every way good.

to take long before announcing their de
cision or their disagreement.
So fully have both sides of the question
been threshed that there will be little to
be said when the commissioners meet In
private, and it is generally believed that
if the arguments have had any Influence
they have already had their effect. Noth
ing which had been adduced is believed to
have weakened the previously expressed
opinions of the American and Canadian
members of the tribunal. What influence
the. contentions have had upon Lord Al
verstone is naturally the chief point of In
terest and surmise. Unless he sees some
reason to disagree with the Canadian
case, the tribunal can quickly agree to
disagree. If the American case has im
pressed his lordship, some interesting
private developments are likely to occur
which may delay the decision.
In any case the best Informed opinion
is that some result will be reached within
two or three days after Counsel Dickin

NEW YORK. Oct. 7.â The Ftock market
mox-^d in a rather bewildered way to-day, but
the df-allrcs represented little more than a
eTcp!ng by rrofeseional traders to discern the
wntlnur.t of the real holders of stocks. Tne
reduction In the eteel dividend brought in
t- Â¦;;Â¦.â¢ heavy selling orders, but they were all
jÂ»c<*eptÂ«-d at Crag by one house, which wan crea

curded this FttK-k, e*pecialy the preferred, dur

of the brokers employed for this purpose causeii
a funr.isc that the market management of the
flocks had OGOe back to the hands that wen

ftock was forced down over a point at one
time and tht- ceneral list ivas hcaiy after the
opening finrmÂ»-fc?. The marked weakness of
Amalgamated Copper, which lost more than
three point* st one time, had a decided eym

who *old the etock jointed to the fact that as

ri.urh trore effect on sentiment than any dlvi

said: "Cables were steady and th* cash de

ceipts were a shade less than -last 'year. Fur-.
ther rains in" the Northwest: were responsible
for a" little firmness : in scalping : operation's, !
which closed the market a little above yester
day's latest prices. Snow's estimate in the
Orange Judd â¢ Farmer is bearish,- placing the
crop estimate at 704,000,000 bushels. The ru
mors of a large export business were not con
firmed. The whole ' situation Is a . dull one,
the principal feature everywhere is accumula

Stock Hay is dragging, but good to choice'
grain descriptions are in good demand and
1 very firm at a further advance of 60c. Feed-
I stuffs are also firm, but prices -are no- higher.
The circular of Somers '& Co. says of Hay:
"The total receipts of Hay for the past week
were 2500 tons, in comparison with 3000 tons
for the week preceding, a difference, of 1100
tons. Everything except Alfalfa Is now under
cover, and already Hay is being shipped fronv
the- warehouses:- This Is an- unprecedented
condition, and, of course, has hail its conse
quent effect tin prices. As will be seen by quo
tations, prices on all grades- of Hay have ad
vanced from $1 to $1 60 per ton.
"Our lbcal demand Is lalrly active, and the
shipping- trade Coastwise Is quite good. Al
teady interior points are buying, having been
tempted by the high prices offered during the
summer to clean out their entire crop, so
taking all these facts into consideration, we
cannot but express our confidence In the fu
ture of the market, as everything points to
ward a' steady and continued advance In
prices for the balance of the season.
"As before, the medium grades of Hay
form the bulk of the present arrivals. Occa
sionally . a car of fancy grade Wheat Hay
comes to market and goes readily at $10 ."0
per ton, and fancy tame Oat has been sold at
from $13 50 to $14 00."

cost gives all such lots an . advance over the

River Burbanks are very weak. Receipts con
tinued large, and stocks are accumulating right '
along. Oregon Potatoes were offering at lower
rates, but found few buyers,, owing to the poor
quality of the stock. Sweets were steady and
unchanged. Fancy Onions were In rather lim
ited supply and firm at an advance.
Tomatoes were abandant and easy. The top
quotation was obtained only for some special
brands from across the bay; 40c being the top
for the general run of supplies.- The canners
were well supplied with contract stock
end were not buying in- the open mar
ket The quotations for Pickle Cucumbers
are withdrawn, as there are very few coming
In. The season for Green Corn Is about over,
and what little, stock Is coming in is very
poor and hard to dispose of. The other veg

â¢ Ch icago prain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. 7. â Everything considered,
wheat prices were strong, due largely to the
unfavorable weather throughout the entire
wheat belt, although smaller receipts added to
the general apprehension among shorts. Open
ing prices were firm. With December a shade
to %@"Â»ic higher at 77%c to 77%c, notwith
standing- the rather indifferent tone of cables.
With some improvement In the cash demand
and on covering by shorts the price advanced
early to 77%Â©77%c, but later sold off again
on prospects of more favorable conditions, the
weather map showing clear skies to-morrow for
the West and Northwest. Selling pressure was
augmented by a private crop estimate of over
70.000,0(Â»0 bushels for the crop year. Commis
sion houses were food buyers late In the day
and the market rallied to about the opening
â¢ figures, December closing %c higher at 77%fe>

heavy rains throughout the corn belt. Decem

Loss of confidence among outside holders of
provisions was given emphatic expression In
the form of general liquidation of long prop

mund T. Perkins, on behalf of the United
States, filed on four million miners' Inches
of water for use in this county and vi
cinity. The document filed with the
Riverside County Recorder this afternoon
is as follows:
Notice Is hereby given that Edmund T. Per
kins, thereunto duly authorized by the Secre
tary of the Interior, for and on behalf ot the
United States of America, under the provisions
of the act of Congress approved June 17, 1902,
claims at the point where this notice is posted
all the unappropriated waters of the Colorado
Riven, both surface and underflow, to the ex
tent of 100.000 cubic second feet â 1,000,000
miner's inches. The point where this notice Is
posted is described as "at a point of rocks
known as Black Point In California, county
of Riverside, about section 7, township .5 south,
range 24 east. San Bernardino meridian."
That said water is claimed for irrigation,
manufacturing purposes, water power, do
mestic use and other beneficial uses, and the
terminus and dace of Intended use is in the
valley extending from Â«ald point along the
Colorado River to and below Ploche. Cal.. and
along the line of the proposed conduit.

The "Women's Home and Foreign Mis
sionary Societies and the Church's Mis
sionary Societies occupied a gTeater part
of the afternoon session of the Congre
gational Association. Reports from the
various societies showed very satisfac
tory conditions, as did also those of the
Sunday School and Publishing Society
and the Church Extension Society. In all
these auxiliaries earnest pleas were made
for a hearty co-operation of the church
members a.nd the pastors. Several special
committees were appointed and the fol
lowing delegates were elected: To the
Synod of the Pacific, Rev. Griffith Grif
fiths, representing The Pacific- Methodist
Episcopal Church Conference; Deacon J.
H. Hayes, Decoto, Methodist Episcopal
Church South Conference; Deacon W. W.
Chase. Third San Francisco, Central Bap
tist Conference: Rev. S. R. Yarrow,
Rocklin, Christian Church Conference;
Rev. O. W. Lucas, Pacific Grove, Central
Association Congregational Church,
Southern California; Rev. H. M. Tenny,
district secretary of American Board* of
Foreign Missions.
WpCtDLxAND, Oct. 7. â At the morning
session. of the General Association of the
Congregational Churches, some radical
changes were suggested, among which
was the proposed repeal of the pledge
exacted of Its members, and which
brought forth .an animated discussion
and strong opposition. The matter Is to
be settled by a committee appointed for
that purpose. The committee reported on
the revision of the constitution and by
laws and the report was adopted. The
only material change effected was be
stowing a new title on the association, aa
follows: ?'General Association of. Cali
fornia Northern."
New Title Is Bestowed
on Congregational
Association.

GRACEâ In this city, October 5, 1003, Joseph
Grace, a native of Ireland, aged 47 years.
A. member of tha Pacific Coast Marine Fire-
men's Union.The five years of war were followed by the
cholera, which carried off upward of 600,000
people. The rhinde-rpest and surra have killed
S*6 per cent of the carabao, the main depend
ence of the natives in planting their sugar,
tobacco and rice, and for two years the locusts
have JeFtroyed many of the growing cropb.
This has been discouraging and It would not
be surprising if the Flliplncs were to associate
these evils with the establishment of Ameri
can control in the islands. In fact, it haB
been believed by many that the cholera was
directly due to sinister American influences
designed to kill off the Filipinos. These are
extreme views, no doubt, but not entirely un
like the practice ln the United States of blam
ing the political party ln control of the. Gov
ernment for all the economic evils which pre
vail while It Is In power.
When I left Manila, remarked the
General, public affairs in the Philippines
were progressing as well as could be ex
pected under the existing conditions.
Continuing, he said:
There are many serious questions for con
sideration, but I believe that Governor Taft
and the members of the Philippine Commission
will no doubt find a way to deal with them ln
a manner to the general satisfaction of the
Filipinos and tor the material benefit of the
Islands. I think It may be said ln all sin
cerity that up to this time we have not had a
fair chance to show what we can do for the
general improvement of the islands.
WORK OF COMMISSION.
I feel Quite sure that the census report to
which we will now give our attention will be
Interesting and Instructive and that It will
dispel many erroneous notions ln regard to
the Philippine Islands and their Inhabitants,
but if it should not meet our expectations ln
this rrsrect the census will not have been In
vain, because It has demonstrated quite clearly
that, under proper guidance, the Filipinos have
the capacity to do good work and that on the
whole they believe in the declared intentions
of the United States to give them a repre
sentative insular government. To have ob
tained such strong presumptive evidence of
the confidence of the people In the Govern
ment, ae the success of the census Indicates,
is certainly very important at this Juncture.
There are about 7.00O.C?0 of civilized and 600,-
OOO non-clvilijed Itih.ih^unts. The census re
port will be compiled nnd published within a
year.
RESULTS OF CENSUS.
Vicious people In Cebu spread a report that
taxation was the real purpose of the Govern
ment in taking the cenaus and ln two or three
barrics of that pueblo aome objection was
made to it, but this was not serious and
easily removed when Governor Taft'a procla
mation was made plain. There wore but four
attempts on the part of the ladrones to Inter
fere with the corwus and one enumerator was
seriously wounded. Ife saved his census rec
ords, however, and, It may be said, at the rink
of his life. While I have had some experi
ence in census taklne. I am not a census ex
pert or statistician, but I have had associated
with me two jtentlemen â Messrs. Gannett' and
Olmste-d of Washinfrton. D. C. â who have de
voted many years to censuses and other sta
tistical work, and. ln their opinion, judging
from the census returns, the work waa thor
oughly and carefully done and the results will
compare favorably with the censuses of the
United States.
FILIPINOS SUSPICIOUS.
In the island of CamaKuin, north of the
province of Misamis. Mindanao, the enumera
tors were threatened and opposed and it was
necessary to use force, but Governor Qorrales
thought the demonstration had other objects
in view and that the census merely precipi
tated the movement.
ThÂ» census was taken a* planned because
the people wanted It taken. Many opinions
Â¦were expressed as to Its practicability, and
the Spaniards and some of our army officers,
especially those who had served In Pamar and
Leyte. believed It to be either impossible or
capable of being finished only after a year or
two of difficult work. Much opposition was
apprehended by them from thÂ« disaffected and
criminal classcÂ». more especially the ladrones
and insurrectos. However, there was no se
rious opposition encountered In any of the
larger islands, and this was especially true of
Samar and Leyte, where there waa no Inter
ference whatever with the enumerators.
In discussing the work, which was car
ried on under his personal direction, Gen
eral Sanger said, last evening:
NATIVES SUBMISSIVE.
It xras General Banger's previous ex
perience in the taking" of the census of
Cuba and Porto Rico that suggested to
the Washington authorities the idea of
giving him similar duties in the Phil
ippines. The census taking began on
March 2 and in six weeks it was com
pleted. Two months' preparatory work
v.as necessary before the hard' task was
undertaken. It was accomplished with
the assistance of 7000 enumerators, and
to-day Uncle Sam is in possession of 7,000,
000 names, representing the civilized por
tion of the native population of the is
lands, and by carefully complied figures
he on estimate that the uncivilized pop
ulation is about 600,000.
General J. P. Sanger, former chief of
staff of General Chaffee, but latterly in
charge of the census work in the Phil
ippine Islands, has arrived from Manila
and is registered at the Palace. He Is on
his way to Washington, for he has com
pleted the difficult task to which he was
assigned.

A petition for a writ of habeas corpus
ln behalf of Ross was filed In the Circuit
Court In January, 1902, and was subse
quently denied. An appeal was then
taken to. the United States Supreme
Court.
Attorney General U. S. "Webb left yes
terday for Washington, D. C, to attend
the October term of the United States Su
preme Court In reference to the habeas
corpus proceedings instituted in behalf of
Bert Ross. The defendant is under sen
tence of death for murder, and every ef
fort has been made to save his life. The
action of the nation's highest tribunal
will settle the matter finally.

. , jf S this Mrs. Luddy?"
COl "No. it's not. It's Miss Flem-
I ing"â as if to emphasize her
*Â¦*â¢ statement the lady addressed
suddenly turned to the register
of the Palace Hotel, grabbed a pen and in
a bold hand inscribed at the bottom of the
page;
"Miss Fleming, Los Angeles."
The new arrival at the Palace is a
rather attractive blonde, of fine figure,
who has been known in Southern Califor
nia under several names, but latterly aa
Mrs. Grace Fleming Luddy. Yesterday
morning her name was conspicous
ly associated with that of Luddy and a
man named Archie Van Curen in a story
telegraphed from Ventura, where It was
charged that Luddy had caused her de
tention while she was en route to this
city with Van Curen. It was Intimated
that the woman was eloping with Van
Curen and that the real purpose of ap
prehending her was to enable Luddy to
recover $6000 worth of diamonds which it
was charged she had failed to return to
the man whom she had represented as
her husband for a number of months in
the southern part of the State.
Luddy, it was claimed, denied that she
was or ever had been his lawful wife and
that for alleging the contrary In a di
vorce suit filed by hÂ£r against him ln Los
Angeles a few days before he purposed
to have her arrested for perjury.
JOINS VAN CUBEN HERE.
The woman remained over night in Ven
tura and then followed Van Curen to this
city, where he had already secured apart
ments with his brother at the Russ
House. When she arrived yesterday morn
lnfc Van Curen was at the depot to greet
her and accompanied her to the Palace.
There they parted for a time, but later
she Joined him for several hours, finally
returning to the Palace about" 3 o'clock
to keep an appointment with the newspa
per reporters, made earlier In the day.
Miss Fleming, as she is more pleased to
call herself, declared that she is not yet
Van Curen, when seen yesterday at the
Russ, .said, he* Is on his way to the Klon
dike. . Regarding Miss Fleming he said he
had become Interested In her while sho
was employed at the springs. 'He denied
that an elopement- had been planned and
that Miss Fleming â¢ and he . are engaged.
According to. a dispatch from Ventura
Luddy and Miss Fleming were secretly
married In Santa Barbara two years ago.
Another dispatch from Los Angeles says
there Is no record of; the .Luddy divorce
there. '.',..Â¦--
As to the references ln yesterday's tele
gram to the effect that L-uddy Is a' well
known capitalist : in " Los Angeles, the
woman who claims to have been his wife
said that he was formerly a saloon keep
er,- but' had- accumulated- property and
had money enough on which to enjoy life
leisurely.
I don't know. In fact I could not expect
to marry him for twelve months, for the law
prohibits a divorcee from marrying within that
time. To be frank I have not made up my
mind what I will do. I may go to 'Alaska,
possibly to Spokane, where I formerly lived,
or back to Richmond. . which Is my old home.
She refused point blank to tell where
or under what conditions she had mar
ried Luddy. Asked .as to. whether there
were any grounds for the suspicion that
she is soon to marry Van Curen, she re
plied: ., . l:Â»Â«
INTERESTED AS A FRIEND.
In this confiding manner Miss Flem
ing continued to tell of her life In South
ern California^ but her story was so dis
jointed at time's that it was hard to de
termine just where she. had been located
and efforts t6 straighten it out were not
particularly successful, for she was
averse to - discussing certain periods of
her nast.
SAYS SHE IS DIVORCED.
A decree of divorce, was granted me late
Saturday afternoon in Loe Angeles on the
ground of desertion. Friday Luddy was in
this . city, staying at the Palace, and tele
graphed me a long mepsage ln response to one
sent by mo notifying him of the divorce find
ings. In his telegram he - implored me to
withdraw the suit. I was glad to get rid of
him and signed a paper waiving all claim to
community property and alimony. â¢
Luddy and I were married â well, it don't
matter where or when. Suffice it to say that
we lived for some time at Wheeler Hot
Springs ln a cottage known to everybody in
that locality as "Luddy villa." A few week3
ago he left me, after we had agreed to separ
ate. I realized that I could not afford to
remain as a guest at the springs, although
the proprietor was anxious that I should. He
finally gave me employment and It was there
that I met Archie Van Curen. the bookkeeper,
under whom I worked. When the season be
gan to draw to a close I did most everything,
even going into the kitchen to wash dishes.
I like that kind of work.
done with Luddy . and intimated yester
day that she may return to Los Angeles,
where he resides, to force him to retract
the accusations he is charged with mak
ing against her. Discussing the affair ln
which she has become Involved,' the
young woman said:
This etory of my having robbed Luddy of a
lot of (Unmonds Is all nonsense. He never
had many valuables. He did possess a dia
mond pin, which I imagine cost him about
?200. but that was stolen from him ln a Los
Angeles hotel .some time ago and while I was
miles away. And then this talk of hH about
mo not having been hfa wife Is -simply redlc
ulous. If I had not been his wife how coulii
I have got a divorce from him? . The best
proof that I was hts wife may be found in
certajn deeds recorded ln the south, t6 which
it was necessary for me to affix my signature.

"We have arranged for grade meetings
in the hall with a view to outlining an
educational policy, and we are met with
petty interferences on every side." said
Langdon as he stalked out of the meeting
room.
Superintendent Langdon and Director
Woodward had a wordy tilt regarding the
latter's right to allow the hall of the
Girls' High School to be used for a spe
cial purpose. Langdon claimed that the
board had sole authority in the matter.
Woodward was for giving permission to
Principal Brooks to use the hall for a bas
ket ball tournament next Friday and
Langdon objected.
At the board's request Patrolman P. J.
Campion was detailed to act as truant
officer to carry out the new truant law.
It- was proposed, with the aid of the
South Park Settlement, to secure pupils
for the Jefferson School, ln which there
are several vacant rooms.
The petition of the Federation of Mis

house be erected in Potrero block No. 127
was taken under advisement.

The board met in the afternoon to give
Miss Jean Dwyer, principal of the South
End School, an opportunity to present ev
idence of physicians that a rattan would
make the black and blue marks such as

whom she Is charged with beating se
verely.
Horace G. Platt, Miss Dwyer's attor-
She denied that she had deserted her
school on October 4, 1S99, without giving
notice to the board. She also denied .that
she ,was Immoral In her conduct and
pertinent to School Directors, and that she
had erer said that Mark, Webster and
Bergerot had put her out of the depart
ment to make room for a favorite.
A/ter hearing Mrs. Greenan's statement
the board took her application for a re
hearing under advisement.
" For the sake of peace Mrs. Greenan
said she had consented to a transfer to
another school after Superintendent
Webster had told her that she would be
"rotten egged" if she returned to her
own echool. Instead of being transferred
Mrs. Greenan says she was ousted from
the department.
Mrs.- Greenan further stated that she
had preferred charges with the Board of
Education agains^School Director Mark,
but they had nevtr been taken up. She
did not accuse Mark of perjuring him
self, but he had sworn falsely under oath,'
Mrs. Greenan said:
CONSENTS TO TRANSFER.
Mrs. Rebecca Greenan, who was dis
missed from her position as principal of
the John V/. Taylor School after a trial,
appeared before the Board o.f Education
yesterday in behalf of her petition that
her case be reopened in order that she
might be given an opportunity to refute
the charges upon which she was dis
missed from the School Department.' .
Rev. Fathers Smith and Gallagher have
Interested themselves in the effort made
by Mrs. Greenan to obtain a rehearing
and were present to assist her in the en
deavor. The charges against Mrs. Green
an, which a former Board of Education,
of which Director Mark was a member,
ruled had been proved, were read and
Mrs. Greenan entered a specific denial to
each of them. To offset the charge of in
competency Mrs. Greenan produced a let
ter from Superintendent of Schools Web
ster testifying to her efficiency as a
teacher. Regarding the charge that she
had closed her school at 2 o'clock p. m.
in order to attend the races, Mrs. Greunan
stated. that she had permission from the
Board of Education to do so and also to
open the school at 9 a. m. because she
lived four miles away from a car line.
Mrs. Greenan blamed Mrs. Burnett, jan
ltress of the school, with having caused
her to get in trouble and she accused Mrs.
Burnett with having one day closed the
school on a forged order, which explained
why a School Director could not get ln
when he called. Mrs. Greenan also
charges Mrs. Nicholls with having writ
ten letters to ex-School Director Bergerot
which caused him to oppose her.
