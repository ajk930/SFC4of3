A few years ago Orson and Mary
Greeley and their brother, Louis Gree
ley, were admitted to this institution.
All were weak-minded and were pau
pers of the aggravated sort.
Louis died some time ago. Then it
was discovered that the Greeleys had
once been related to persons in 'Staf

dent Farmer wrote to the Probate
Judge. He ascertained after much cor
respondence that his charges were not
onljÂ» cousins of the late Horace Gree

many years past lhey* had been sole
heirs to a great and unclaimed estate
in Kansas.
Mary and Orson, when told of their
Kansas wealth, evidenced no surprise
or joy, failing to comprehend that they
were able to b"uy the place where they
lived and the extensive farms which
surround it.
Superintendent Farmer made appli

and straighten out their affairs.

"Senator Hanna has formally and

after the expiration of his term, which
will be when the national convention
meets at Chicago in June.
'â¢President Roosevelt has offered
Ellhu Root the chairmanship of the
National Committee. Mr. Root has
taken the matter under consideration.
Though at the present moment Mr.
Root is much inclined to adhere
strictly to his determination to retire
wholly from active political life. a3
well as from public life, and to devote
his entire time to the practice of law
in New York City, there i3 still a pos
sibility that President Roosevelt will
be able to induce him to consent to
serve as national chairman and as the
manager of next year's campaign.
"The President and Secretary Root
have had several conferences on the
subject since the President was re
cently placed in possession of Senator
Haana's final and definite declination
to continue in office. Only this after
noon the President and his War Secre

the post if the President cannot find

where he feels it his duty to take most

BIG LOSS TO PRODUCERS.
During the past two years, or within
>the life of the existing aj^recrnent, the
Export business has amounted to an
iinnual output of 250,000,000 feet, which
is figured at a basis rate of $14 a thou
tar.d. With the abandonment of the
producers' agreement it is expected
that there will be a lively cutting in

the entire coast. He predicted that bit
j>\er competition would follow the break
ing up of the organization and that a
cutting of prices would prove disas
trous to the producers.
The insinuation was also thrown out
that a certain local lumber representa
tive had been guilty of a serious viola
tion of the organization's rules in
secretly cutting the established prices
and filling orders in foreign markets for
Fix months ahead. When thÂ» meeting
adjourned it was apparent that Mc-
Cormick and his associates were angry
and they did not attempt to conceal the
fact when they Btarted for Portland on
last evening's train.
It was stated by a prominent mem
ber of the Pacific Coast lumbermen
last evening that the breaking up of
the export trade compact had been
planned for some time. A number of t
local firms, which had previously been
lo>a! to the organization, had lately
arrived at the conclusion that they had
developed a large business abroad and \
could carry it along without the aid
cf a combine. Hence their Indifference

an agreement would not be reached
and before the meeting had progressed
far a bitter feeling was demonstrating
itself. It was plain that some motive
other than the objection mad<; in the
north to the prorating clajisp was a
predominating influence and the mem
bers from Portland did not hesitate to
suggeEt this fact. Finally, realizing
that all efforts toward peace were use
less, McCormick and his associates left
the meeting, but not before McCormick
had warned the millmen that their
stand may result in the complete de
moralization of the lumber interests of

From the start it was evident that

them to penalties, and it was upon this
question that the members /ailed to

committee should be sent to this city
to confer with thr local export agents,
with the hope of bringing about a set
tlement of the differences, and R. L.
McCormick. representing the Weyer

It was demanded by the millmen
from this StatÂ» that this clause should
be reconstructed so as to permit-mill
men to exceed their quota in certain

| blow, for a maintenance of the present
prices cannot be hoped for and it is
estimated that the threatened competi

The conference held yesterday was
the result of a disagreement of the
millmen in Portland last week, when
a meeting of the members of the organ

Merchants' Association Addresses Let

the Adoption of Scheme.
The members of the Merchants' As
sociation have addresed a circular to
the Board of Public W6rks requesting
that body to consider the plan of hav
ing the streets cleaned and sprinkled
by thd city instead of letting the con
tracts out to various contractors. The
association asks that" the matter be
taken up and passed upon by the
board by the first of the year, when
the present contracts will expire.
The association argues that the work
can be done better and cheaper by the
city. The association urges that In
spectors and workmen be appointed
and all placed under civil service regu
lations so that" there may be no fight
over the award of patronage. The
matter will probably be taken up' and
discussed by ; the board at the next
meeting. "

Schwab's Attorney Wants Some One
Punished for Giving Out Letters.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2\â The hearing in
the United States shipbuilding re
ceivership proceedings was continued
until to-morrow, because of the illness
of Counsel Untermeyer of the" suing
bondholders. Before the examiner an-'
nounced the ; adjournment â¢ Guthrie,
counsel for Schwab and others, made
a statement .'regarding the publication
of^ the letters and telegrams that
passed between the firm of Alexander
& Green regarding the French under
writers. Guthrie said in part:
"I desire to call the examiner's at
tention to the publication in a news
paper in this^city this morning of the
letters,' telegrams and cables which
have been the, object* of examination
at several hearings, before ydu. â¢
"Those letters, telegrams and cable
grams were not exhibited in evidence
because Mr. Alexander felt constrained
to plead privilege and confidence, be
cause they were the private communi
cations from members of the firm in
relation to the private business . of
their , clients. Pending the ruflng of
the tiourt.on the question of admlssl
bllity of these communications, vl.lch
you said you would certify to the court,
and while these letters, telegrams and
cablegrams were claimed to be privi
leged/they. were furnished to^a news
paper and published this morning. We
understand this publication to be a
direct contempt of court, and that the
person guilty of causing. their publica
tion is guilty of a gross contempt.
We ask you, therefore, that at the next
hearing we may temporarily suspend
the taking of testimony of complain
ants' witnesses and take testimony as
to the person who gave publication to
these letters, , telegrams and cable
grams."
Wollman, associate counsel with
Samuel Untermyer, replied:
"If there is to be an insinuation that
Mr. Untermyer or myself had any
thing to do with giving publicity to
these communications, I here declare
that it is absolutely untrue. Neither
Mr. Untermyer nor I had anything to
do with giving out these letters. Â¦ tele
grams and cablegrams to the' press.
Mr. Guthrie knows there are many
copies of them in existence and that
copies could easily be obtained. , I was
as much surprised at seeing them pub
lished this morning as Mr.. Guthrie
could have been."
! "I hope so, -^or the good name of
the bar," exclaimed Mr. Guthrie.
"You have done much in this case
against the good name of the bar, Mr.
Guthrie." replied Wollman. "Your
course has been reprehensible." I do
not know, nor do I care, what the law
Is, but the persons who gave these
communications to the press ought to
be punished. I do not object to Mr.
Guthriels insinuation when Mr. Guth
rie knows, as he does, how easy it is
to get these copies."
â¢ Atter some further discussion be
tween counsel it was agreed they
should co-operate in an effort to learn
who gave out the communications in
question.

The Duke and Duchess of Rox
burghe will remain at Broxmouth
Park for a fortnight.
The tenants were introduced to .the
Duchess (formerly Miss May Goelet of
New York), by the T>uke, who deliv
ered a brief speech to the tenants and
to the Dunbar municipal officials,
thanking them for their reception.
Thousands of persons were gathered
outside the station, and they enthusi
astkally cheered the couple. As soon
as the Duke and Duchess entered, the
carriage the horses were unhitched
and the carriage was drawn by the
coast guardsmen, preceded by pipers,
to Broxmouth Park, the seat -of the
Roxburghes, which is two miles dis
ftant from Dunbar. The carriage was
lollowed by 200 torchbearers. "
The streets of Dunbar were gaily
decorated, and thousands cheerfed the
Duke and Duchess as they passed.
There was a grand display of fire
works in Dunbar and vicinity to-night.
EDINBURGH. Dec. 22. â The Duke
and Duchess of Roxburghe arrived at
Dunbar to-night and were given- a
magnificent reception. They were
met at the depot by' the provost and
the members of the Dunbar town

NEW YORK. Dec. 22.â Frank H/
Burness, 44 years old, who shot and
killed Captain George B. Townsend of
the schooner Charles K. Buckley on
November 10, because Townsend would
not v pay him $6 30 which the prisoner
alleged to be due him, was convicted
to-day of murder in the- first degree.
The murderer, who admits having
killed three men besides Townsend, in
sisted that he did the deed with pre
meditation and in a full realization of
the consequences. Burness smiled
broadly when the jury was being polled.
Judge Crane said he. would sentence
Burness on Monday. : Burness then
asked the Judge if he would be permit
ted to say something. On being given
the privilege he said:
"There may be an Idea In the minds
of some of the jurors that I hold a
grudge against them for naving found
me guilty. I wish to say that I do not
feel in that way in the Â«lightest. and
all I can say is I wish them all a merry
Christmas." *. :-;''':
When asked\ what he thought would
be the result of his act he coolly re
plied:
"I only see one way out, of it."
"What is that?" ; '
CHICAGO, Dec. 22.â The' Liverymen's
Association at a meeting this after
noon decided that unless a peaceable
settlement- of the drivers* strike waa
reached to-morrow it would open for
business with non-union employes and
would appeal to ' the courts for an in
junction 7to prevent the strikers inter
fering in any manner with the driving
of carriages ;orj hearses. Word of the
injunction proposal reached the strikers
just as a \'ote.had been completed to
submit the^ issjies in the : . controversy
to arbitration and the action of . the
employers was bitterly criticized by
the men. No announcement of the re;
suit of the vote of the strikers was
made,- but the general impression was
that: arbitration had been accepted. .
At the time the men were voting on
the question of conciliation the mem
bers of 1 the Liverymen's Association
decided to submit the whole dispute to
arbitration/Rrovided 'that the strikers
took the inlTfative and that the demand
for '. a pe"aceable,-settlement came from
the men. In anticipation of the propo
sition being accepted by thenien a com
mittee .was appointed to- receive any
overtures that the union might be will
ing to make. The union officials were
immediately notified of v th-j decision
reached by the employers and the lat
ter, it is understood, will have a reply
ready to-morrow morning.
The first. "union label funeral" since
the strike began occurred to-day. ,The
funeral was arranged by Undertaker
G. M. Marks, the corpse being removed
in a "dead" wagon bearing the placard
proclaiming that the vehicle was owned
by an undertaker paying the -union
scale. The carriages containing the
mourners were similarly labeled.
The funeral of John J. Kelly was held
under cover of darkness on account of
the possibility of violence. The services
had been announced before the recall
o\S pickets last night. After simple home
services an undertaker's, wagon con
veyed the remains to a railroad depot,
from which the corpse was shipped to
St. Paul, Minn. â¢ Â¦ Â¦ â¢ .-
The body of Mrs. Catherine- Master
son, the mother of Rev. John Masterson,
was borne through, the streets to the
Church of the Holy Family on an un
der taker!s truck, which was used in
substitution for a hearse. Six pall
bearers walked bareheaded beside the
flower-strewn coffin, and following them
came a procession of mourners. -Fifty
carriages had been asked for, but none
were provided,' and more than 200 perr
sons were prevented attending the bu
rial^ j :' * . ; Â¦;;Â¦ r Â¦ , i
One*i of. many, other .funerals from
which hearses were withheld to-day
took place not far from the Masterson
hom% and led to the charge that liv
erymen had entered into a pool or com
bination to prevent the use of hearses
for bearing dead to the graves. After
engaging* a hearse for a funeral Un
dertaker Marks, who yesterday signed
union scale, was refused by a liv
ery owner, the use of the vehicle. For
two hours the funeral was delayed
while the mourners awaited a hearse.
When none 'could be had a "dead"
wagon was used. ' *

"I saw Harjes, who said that he had
very much prejudice against the af

indignant and said that I had not in

there were any defaults."

In the correspondence is included the
following cablegram:

YOUNG A "MERE PROMOTER."
A letter dated July 28 sets forth that
the situation had changed, and that
the writer had notified Oppenhelm that
all the French investors would be held
to their individual liability. A post
script to this letter reads thus:
"P. S.-~S!nce writing the above Rog
nlat (one of the underwriters) came in
in a great etate of excitement and said
that he had been to see -Harjes and
asked whether they knew- anything
cboutthe business; that he was accom
panied by a man who spoke English
and he listened; # that the cashier did
everything he could to speak badly
nbout the business, and said there were
no quotations for the securities in New
York, and that they did not want io
have anything to do with it, although
they would receive the .money for it.
Rogniat was very indignant and came
to me.
"I hear he has $1,000,000 belonging to
one old woman to invest at his discre
tion." , . .
"'"In this same letter there is also this
statement: . -. y . 9
"I got a pledge from -the Drexels
that everything good should be said of
the enterprise." /
One of the French underwriters Was
named Schreyer, and the following
reference was made to him in one of
the letters:
; The letter criticized severely, in, a
I; postscript, the Impressions said to have
been thrown out by "the younger Har
;Jes, who was reported to be very much'
I prejudiced against the whole affalr r Â«and
: it was said by the cashier that
: there was no market in New York- for

Lyonafse, and .thereupon Harjes agree'd
; to tell. everything good. he could about
the personnel of the company 'and the
affair^ Efforts through other- sources
!a.lso were made, according to 'letters

J the. effect of. various reports circulated
, as 'to the impending collapse . of the

TELLS OF PLEDGE BY' MORGAN.
In another letter, dated July 11, 1902,
signed by Alexander, the statement is
made that in- investigating the Bank
de Roma the writer learned that the
Pope had $6,000,000 in that bank; that
he had a similar sum with the Roths
childs and about the same amount in
England.
According to the "World, "Drexels"
was used in the correspondence to rep

one of the letters credited to Alexander

conceived any scheme of transferring
to the shipbuilding company the stock
of the Bethlehem company at an ex
cessive rate or upon conditions permit
ting him or his associates to control
the shipbuilding company or to absorb,
for his benefit, 'Jalfof its property and
assets, to the injury of its creditors
and of its bona -fide bondholders and
.stockholders, or otherwise."
Schwab denies "that he ever made any
false representations regarding the
; Bethlehem Steel Company and denies
that his stock; on July 31; 1902, was not;
worth to exceed $7,500,000. â¢
Schwab repudiates any' connection
with .John V\V. young and says he never
caused the latter to' propose to .the
shipbuilding directors to transfer 300,
000 shares of Bethlehem stock, and $10,
(K)0,000 each' of bonds, preferred and
commo/i : stock ; of the shipbuilding
: Heeays:' v Â¦ ;
'Â¦ I "I. admit that I am the owner* and
;hblder of upward of $9,000,000 of the $10,
000,000 of the bonds; and. upward 'of $9,
000,000 of the $10,000,000 of the preferred
and upward of $9,000,000 of the $10,000,000
of the common stock of the shipbuild
ing company, issued' for the stock, of
the steel company, but I deny that any
associates of mine are the owners; of
the remainder of the preferred and
common stock so' issued for' the. stock
of the Bethlehem Steel' Company, .ex
cept that I sold and transferred some
of said bonds and stocks to third
â¢parties."
Schwab says the shipbuilding com
pany is not., entitled to . enforce any
alleged indebtedness agaist him. He
avers that neither he nor his associates
conspired with \ the "dummy directors
of the shipbuilding company" to .have
inserted in the mortgage to the Security
and Trust Company and in the charter
of the shipbuilding company provisions
Which would give him or them absolute
control of the shipbuilding and steel
companies, with the power jto so ma
nipulate the corporations as to cause
default in the .payment of interest,
thereby defrauding creditors, stock
holders and -bondholders of the ship
building company. ; â¢
Schwab says that he and his* asso
ciates had nothing to do with the with
holding by the Bethlehem company oS
the dividend payments on the 300,000
shares of its stock owned by the ship
building company for the purpose of
wrecking the latter concern. The de
fendant continues:
; "I deny that I or the Security and
Trust Company, or the directors of the
shipbuilding company or of the steel
company, or any associates of mine,
or'the reorganization committee of any'
of them acted fraudulently or in bad
faith in the premises or for the pur
pose of destroying and wrecking the
property of the shipbuilding company
in the interests of myself or any asso
ciates of mine, and I deny that this
suit is brought at the instance of the
reorganization i committee i and myself,
or any associates Of mine for the pur
pose' of carrying out the aforesaid or
any other wrongful plan or of profit
ing, and taking' advantage of the. al
leged defaults occasioned by any
wrongful or fraudulent acts to the in
jury of the shipbuilding company or
the bona fide creditors, bondholders or
stockholders of the shipbuilding com
pany." , Â¦
After specifically denying any and
every charge of fraud, unlawful, com
bination, conspiracy or wrongful act in
his connection with the arfairs of the
Bethlehem Steel and United States
Shipbuilding companies, Schwab de
tails the history of his relations wit^i
the two concerns. He says that after
making a contract for the purchase of
the entire capital stock of the Bethle
hem company he communicated with
J. P. Morgan '& Co., stating that he
was willing to turn over the contract
to the United States Steel .Corporation
"without any profit whatever."
Morgan & Co. assumed the contract
as syndicate manager, with authority
to turn it over to the steel corporation.
If, however, the Morgan firm disposed
of it to other parties Schwab was to
receive the greater part of the profit.
He says that on June 9*, 1902, Lewis
Nixon and D. lie Roy Dresser asked
him 'to underwrite $9,000,000 first mort
gage bonds of the United States'Ship
building Company. Prior to that he
had no connection with a^iy such com
bination. On this subject he continues:
"Nixoh and Dresser informed me
that the properties were of great value;
that they had been appraised by com
petent appraisers."
In view of this, Schwab took the un
derwriting "upon the same terms as
other underwriters, providing the new
company would give preference to the
steel corporation in purchase of materi
als. Subsequently the bonds were of
fered to the public in the United States
and Europe.",
On June 1, 1902, Nixon and Dresser
told Schwab they wished' to acquire the
Bethlehem Steel Company, in ordec to*
transfer it to the shipbuilding com
pany, making payr--nt therefor in
bonds and stock of the new company.
They offered $10,000,000 each of bonds
and common and preferred stock.
Schwab then opened" negotiations with
Morgan & v Co., offering to provide the
cap!*-' necessary to reimburse them
for the actual cost of the shares of the
Bethlehem company to the syndicate,
and $5,000,000 in stock. This offer was
accepted and Nixon and Dresser were
so informed. Then followed Schwab's
illness and his absence from the United
States." Upon his return he found the
shipbuilding company in financial dif
ficulties and-learned, for the first time,
that many of the representations in the
prospectus of the shipbuilding, plants
were I false.
Last April, George R. Sheldon and
Charles W. Wetmore of New York, rep
resenting* a : syndicate which had pur
chased $13,750,000 of the bonds and stock
of the shipbuilding company, conferred
with Schwab, looking to a reorganiza
tion of the company. Schwab said he
desired to take 'back the
stock, returning to the shipbuilding
company the bonds and : stock he had
received. Subsequently, t fqr that pur
pose,* hk purchased f rom . J. P. . Morgan
i& Co. $5,000,000 of stock, which. had b.een
delivered to them for- the;Uriited States
Steel Corporation, and arranged StoVac
-quire all the remaining bonds "and
stocks. Schwab adds:
v "I; was then and have ever since been
and am now able and willing to return
all the securities received by me or
Messrs. Morgan & Co. arid to rescind
the whole transaction and I hereby
tenHer the same for that purpose."
Sheldon and Wetmore declined to con
sider such a proposition, as they stated
the principal value of the whole enter
prise consisted of the Bethlehem com
pany. Schwab then agreed to a 'plan
of reorganization with them, suggest
ing an assessment upon lirst mortgage
bondholders. He says: \
"As to the charges in the cross bill
that. I acted in collusion with the re
organization committee of the ship
building company in an attempt, to
force* the insolvency of > said company
and to wreck-it, I aver Vihat such
charges' are *false and malicious. I
aver that James Smith Jr., receiver of.
the shipbuilding company, knows that
such charges are. untrue.
' "I am Informed ' and believe that
upon such 'an .examination and ap
praisal it will appear that the net work-
Ing capital jof '-the 'seven constituent
companies, /excluding the â¢ â¢ Bethlehem
company* does -not exceed the sum of
11.500,000; that a v great part, if not the
greater part thereof, may be wasted
and lost by the continuance of the re
ceivership ana -that such shipbuilding
plants cannot, be" operated and kept
working as gotng concerns without the
addition of very viarge' sums of money
as necessary wtjrking capital." :
Schwab closes: his defense by denying
every chat-ge/of .fraud, misdoing, un
lawful combination and confederacy,
and ' "humbly prays to be hence dis
missed with his reasonable costs and
charges in' this behalf most wrongfully
sustained." . Â¦

bles, however, and some of them were
full grown.. He was taken captive once
by Cyrus and only saved himself from
being: burned alive by quoting a saying
of Solon the sa^e. He finally had to
flee his kingrdom for parts unknown.
â¢ Many of the rich man's troubles to-
day come from high living and could
be avoided. They are brought on by
eating all kinds of rich, heavy foods
at Irregular times, lack of proper ex-
ercise, undue mental strain, unnatural
stimulants, etc.. and are commonly
known as indigestion, Â¦ dyspepsia and
weak stomach. They are serious trou-
"bles air right, but not only can they
be avoided, but can also be cured, and
that without loss of time or proper food
and nourishment. "
Â§tuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
certain relief of dyspeptics, rich and
poor alike. There It no such thing as
stopping their onward progress now.
'A great nation has placed its stamp of
approval uiÂ»on their noble work. The
.thousands and thousands of cures they
have effected and the happiness result-
â¢ ing therefrom have madÂ« their name a
, household word throughout the land.
. The story of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets can be told in a word. They
.actually do the work that the weak
| and wasted stomach is unable to do
"and allow it to^ recuperate and regain
its strength. They contain all the es-
sential properties thatthe' gastric Juice
and other digestive fluids do. and they
/diffest the food just as a" sound and well
stomach would. They relieve the stom-
;ach Just as one rested and refreshed
â¢ workman relieves the one on duty that
is tired and worn, and Nature does her
.own work of restoration. It is a simple,
.natural process that a child can un-
derstand. You can eat all you want
without fear- of results. Stuart's Dys-
\ pepsia 1 Tablets are for saJe by all drug-
gists at SO cents a box. Druggists all
. know better than to try to get along
. without them, as tbe demand for them
. is gTeat and universal. * .

DR. SHOOP'S REMEDIES.
Any honest person who suffers from Rheu-
matism is 'welcome to this offer. For years I
searched everywhere to find a speclflc (or Rheu-
matism. For nearly 20 years I worked to this
end. At last, in Germany, my search was re-
warded. I found a costly chemical that did not
disappoint me as. other Rheumatic prescriptions
had disappointed physicians everywhere.
I do not mean that Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic
Cure can turn bony Joints Into flesh again. That
is Impossible. But It will drive from the blood
the poison that causes paln^and swelling;, and
then that, Is the end of Rheumatism. I kaow
4hls so well that I will furnish for a full month
my Rheumatic Cure on trial. I cannot cur* all
cases within a month. It would be unreason-
able to expect 1 that. But meat cases will yield
within 30 days. This trial treatment will con-
vince you that Dr. Snoop's Rheumatic Cure Is
a power against Rheumatism â * potent forca
against- disease that is irresistible. ','.'.â¢"
â¢ My offer is mad* to convince you of ray faith.
My faith Is but the outcome of experienceâof
actual knowledge. 1 know what It can do. And
I know this so well that I will furnish my rem-
edy on trial. Simply write me a postal for my
book on Rheumatism. I will then arrange with
a. druggist In your vicinity so that you can se-
cure six bottles of Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cur*
to make tbe test. Ton make take It a fall month
on trial. It it succeeds the *eost to you is 15 60.
If it fails the loss Is mine and mine alone. It
will be" left entirely to you. I mean that ex-
actly. If you say thÂ« trial is net satisfactory I
don't expect a penny from you. j
I hav* no samples. Any mere sample that
can affect chronic Rheumatism rauat bt drursed
to the verge of danger. I us* no such- drugs,
for it is dangerous to take them. Tou must get
th*. disease out of the blood. My remedy does
that even In the most difficult, obstinate cases.
It has cured the eldest cases that I ever met.
and in all of my experience. In all of my 3000
tests, I never found another remedy that would
cure one chrome case-In ten. Â¦ .
Write me and I will Send you the book. . Try
my remedy for a month, for it can't barm you
anyway. If it fails the loss is mine. - '
Address Dr. Shoop. Box 630. Racine. Wis.
Mild cases aot chronic are often cured by one

FIRE RUIN'S PROPERTY
OX COLLEGE GROUNDS
St. Matthew's at San Mateo Has a Xar
ro\v Escape from Destruction
by Flames.
SAN MATEO, Dec. 22.â St. Matthew's
College narrowly escaped destruction
by fire this evening, when the large
laundry situated on the campus was
burned to the ground.
On the report that the college was
burning the Fire Department promptly
responded, drawing the apparatus two
miles to the scene of the blaze. Only
the prompt and energetic measures
saved the jjashouse, the burning of
which would have been disastrous to
the college buildings. The students are
all away on holiday vacation, and only
Professor Brewer's mother, the matron
and cook were on the premises.
The loss of the building and ma
chinery is about $2000. The property is
partially insured.

PHOENIX. Ariz., Dec. 22.â Arthur j
Rehwald, a Russian subject, who says j
he is wealthy, languishes in the jail of
this county, while planning some sort
of legal escape from what he deems an
attempt to railroad him to the peniten- |
tlary upon a charge of burglary. He !
speaks good English and is well edu- i
cated. j
The alleged offense occurred at Sen- j
tinel, a little railroad station on the !
Southern Pacific, where he unknowing- j
ly entered a railroad car occupied by j
Mexicans. When he found the car |
filled he tried to get out, but was ar- |
rested by a Mexican officer, tri^d before '
a country Justice of the Peace upon j
testimony he did not understand and '.
that was not interpreted to him. He j
was sent to jail, he supposed, for vag- 1
rancy. till he was informed after his Â¦
incarceration some weeks ago that he !
was being held to the Granrt Jury for
burglary.
Then he secured a lawyer and told |
his story, which was that he came from j
a good family in Riga, Russia, and !
that he and his people are wealthy. He !
wanted to see the world and sailed for !
New York, from there coming west, |
and was en route from Galveston to '
the coast when arrested. The case is
now before the court on nabeas corpus
proceedings.

largest robbery of a business house
that ever occurred in Phoenix and
one unique in point of simplicity and
successful accomplishment took place
last night, when the store of Selim,
Ackel & Co., on South Second street,
was ransacked and goods to the
amount of I3P00, together with near
ly $100 In cash, were carried away.
The store was entered through the
front door on aj well-lighted street
and the robbers departed, leaving not
a clew to their identity or number.
The merchandise taken was mostly
jewelry and watches. The safe was
rifled and the partitions in it were
broken. The burglars found the hid
ing place of nearly every tray of jew
elry. The greater part of the jewelry
was of a valuable sort, mostly gold
filigree, manufactured in the store by
an expert workman from Mexico.
There was also a quantity of silver
jewelry made from Mexican coins.

VANCOUVER. B. C. Dec. 22.âWil
liam Page, a burglar and general des
perado, was caught to-day and is in
jail in New Westminster. To Garvin
Rae. a youth of 19, belongs all the
credit of his capture. In th? face of
a loaded revolver flourished by Page
Rae grappled with him and held him
tightly until assistance arrived.
Within an hour of his being placed
in jail Page started to carry oat a plan
of escape. He pulled out a number of
bricks and would probably have been
free in another couple of hours had his
trick not been discovered. Now he is
manacled and in dose confinement.
It was at 10:30 o'clock last evening
that several members of the Rae fam
ily heard a noise in a back room. Young
Rae went into the hall to investigate
and when he saw the door standing
open toward the back yard he at once
concluded that a burglar had been in
the house and had already escaped.
He called other members of the fam
ily, when suddenly the door of the
bathroom, a short distance down the
hall, was flung open.
Out jumped a stranger and it took
him but a couple of leaps to make the
rear door. In one hand he held a re
volver and he pulled this up as if
ready to shoot, in warning for young
Rae to get out of the way. But the
latter jumped on the burglar as he
sought to dash past ana in a moment
the two were rolling on rhe floor.
Rae's father rushed to his son's as
sistance and soon they had the des
perado securely held and had taken
away his weapon. Another member of
the family summoned an officer and
twenty minutes later the burglar was
securely lodged in jail.
THIEVES TAKE
TRAYS OF GEMS
VICTORIA, B. C. Dec. 22.âTesti
mony was given by Mrs. John J. Ag
new this afternoon in the Hopper-
Dunsmuir will case, to the effect that
the late Alexander Dunsmuir had al
waj-s intended that James Dunsmuir,
defendant in, the suit brought by Edna
Wallace Hopper, to break the will of
the dead millionaire, should be his heir.
Mrs. Agnew said she had. known the
late Mrs. Dunsmuir (plaintiff's mother)
for seventeen years. She was her most
intimate friend and had been intro
duced to Alexander Dunsmuir by her
at the Grand Hotel in San Francisco.
She had seen him frequently and al
ways found him to be a gentleman. His
conversation was the same as any
other gentleman's, coherent and intel
ligent. Witness said she had arranged
for the marriage ceremony. She knew
of no other. She had heard of the bath
tub incident of which Mrs. Hopper had
told and said this had always been re
garded as a joke by Mrs. Wallace arid
Mrs. Hooper.
Mrs. Agnew said that in a conversa
tion with Alexander Dunsmuir and
Mrs. Dunsmuir at the Grand Hotel ref
erence had been made to a will regard
ing the disposition of the San Leanditi
property, in which Mrs. Dunsmuir was
named as part heir, and Alexander
Dunsmuir at that time told all present.
Including Lawyer Boyd and Captain
Freeman, that he would not permit her
to leave this property to Mrs. Hopper.
The will was afterward burned. v
At his wedding dinner, the witness
said, Dunsmuir had not drank much
and his eating had none of the objec
tionable features referred to by some
witnesses. The will in question now
was signed after dinner. Witness also
told of a conversation with Mrs. Duns
muir relative to Alexander Dunsmuir
providing for her. in the event of Alex
ander's death, in which Mrs. Dunsmuir
had said:
"I feel so happy now, as in the event
of Alexander's death James Dunsmuir
has agreed to pay me $1000 a month so
long as I live."
J. W. Harrison, coal broker of San
Francisco, testified that Alexander
Dunsmuir was a good business man
and not easily influenced by his broth
er, James Dunsmuir.

DENIAL OF ACCUSATIONS
CHASE NEAR RED BLUFF
Photograph Leads to the Dis-
covcry of the Whereabouts
of Man Wanted in Sonoma
Ri-D BLUFF. Dev. 22.-After a night
and half a day of excitement Girard.
supposed to be .and who himself states
that be is wanted in Sonor^a County
for the murder of Deputy Sheriff Mc-
Kir.r.on of Harney County, Oregon, sur
j'-ndercd to officers at the ranch of
Mrs. M. E. WIlcox about four miles
north of Red Bluff this morning.
Girard had been Â¦working as a wood
rhopper on a ranch for pome time and
his discovery is due :o an acquaintance
formed with H. Brewer, a local piano
tuner. Brewer has known him for some
time, but had never suspected his real
character until yesterday, when he
chanced to s^e a photograph of Mc-
Kinnon's murderer and recognized it.
He at once went to the ranch with the
intention of securing the assistance of
W. C. Itiount, a rancher, and capturing
Girard.
Brewer was met at the sate by Gi
rard and accompanied him to his cabin.
After some conversation, during which
Brewer evidently abandoned his Inten
tion of a single-handed capture, he
went to the home of Mrs. Wilcox and
informed her who Girard was. Then
he came to town to notify the officers.
Sheriff Boyd and City Marshal Ward
arrived at the ranch about 2 o'clock
this morning, hoping to get Girard at
daybreak. In this they were disap
pointed, as Girard early in the morn
ing left hi? cabin and took to the brush
in the hills. The officers followed him
for several hours and a number of
phots were exchanged. In the mean
time word was sent to town and a posse
went to the officers' assistance, but
arrived only in time to witness Girard's
surrender.
Girard called to the Sheriff that he
was phot and would surrender either to
him or Mrs. Wllcox's little son. so that
they could get the reward. He stated
that h n was the man wanted.
Gerard is now in the County Jail. Two
f>f Sheriff Boyd's buckshot took effect
in his shoulder and a number in the
ripht leg. but the wounds are not se
rious.

Charles Gribblc, Who Illegally Sold

Police Conrt Jury.
OAKLAND, Dec. 22.â Charles Grib
ble, a grocer at Seventh and Oak
streets, was convicted by a jury to
day in Department 1 of the Police
Court of selling liquor without a li
cense. Deputy License Inspector
Franke arrested Gribble last month, af
ter evidence had been procured that thÂ«
grocer was unlawfully dealing In bot
tled beer. The arrest was the first of
several planned by License Inspector
Ed Meek in cases similar to that of
Grtbble and among grocer3 who wejyi
supecte<i of evading the municipal^
liquor license ordinance. \ ; *. Â«
The prosecution was conducted by .
Prosecuting Attorney A. P. Leach. "i
The committee was informed that the
delay in receiving checks was due sole
ly to the rush of work in the general
offices and it would be utterly impossi
ble under the circumstances to have
them ready by the hour named, out
that they would be here In two or three
days. A meeting was held in Kern
City to-night by the onions which was
not concluded at midnight. Nothing
definite regarding the proceedings is
obtainable, although it .is said that the
kentlment is far from unanimous for
following up the committee's throat
Â»nd it is believed that no radical steps
nill be taken.
There has been much dissatisfaction
over the delay in getting the pay
checks ever since that system was in
augurated. Each month there has been
complaining, but no intimation that
radical action would be taken was
heard until to-day. Should any trouble
occur to-morrow It is expected to be
entirely local.

TUESDAY/ DECEMBER 22,
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
HELENA, Mont.. Dec. 22.â In the
Gravelle case to-day a second witness
testified to Gravelle having told him
he was the man who was doing the
dynamiting on the Northern Pacific.
This witness was Thomas Shanks,
father of Myron Shanks, the son testi
fying yesterday to the same'effect. Ac
cording, to the elder Shanks, Gravelle
often called at his house after he had
been released from prison in July. On
the night of October 14, four days be
fore Gravelle was arrested, the witness
said Gravelle told him he was going
to put dynamite that night on the
Northern Pacific track near Birds Eye.
The powder was found at that point
the next morning. The witness said
the defendant told him that there was
no one else in the dynamite plot. He
also said Gravelly told him he had no
tified the Great to run a sig
nal within twelve days. The witness
said Gravelle gave him a letter that
night to mail. It was addressed to the
vice president of the Great Northern.
Shanks said he took the letter, carried
it downtown the next day and, bring
ing it home, burned it.
Major James C. Keown, who was in
charge or the party that trailed a man
from, the Northern Pacific -track near
Blossburg to a cabin in a mountain
pass twelve miles away, testified about
the capture of Gravelle October- 18, and
so did Frank Latta, another of the
party. The State will probably con
clude its case to-morrow.
CHICAGO, Dec. 22.â Five members
of the Electrical Workers* Union, re
cently indicted for participation in a
plot to keep witnesses out of the State
and prevent them from testifying-,
pleaded guilty to-day before Judge Me-
Ewen. The men were A. B. Wilson, J.
T. Kingsbury, Charles L. White, John
M. Mahoney and William Cleft.
The case in connection with which
the men admit their guilt was that
against Harry Pelkus, an employe of
the Clerk of the Criminal Court, who
is charged with having falsified . the
court records to show that cases
against one George Gallagher, Indicted
for assaulting non-union men, had been
dismissed. It was claimed that Pelkus
received $300 for his part of the work.
It was shown by Edwin Archer, for
merly treasurer of the union, that the
money had been appropriated for the
purpose of rewarding Pelkus. Pelkus
will be tried later and Gallagher has
fled from the city.
Two officials and three other .mem
bers of Franklin Union of Press Feed
ers were indicted by the grand jury to
day, the specific charge against them
being riot. The men indicted are
Charles Woerner, president of the un
ion; John Sea, treasurer; Frederick
Mitchell, Joseph Mucher and Charles
Smith. It is said the indictments were
found on the strength of affidavits
made by men who suffered from vio
lence during the press feeders' strike.
Efforts on the part of the Jury to se
cure similar evidence against the of
ficials of the Street Car Men's Union
did not prove so successful. It was
found difficult to secure any evidence
tending to show that officials of the un
ion urged their men to violence.

Mayor Scfimitz attended the meeting
of the Police Commissioners last night
and took a deep Interest in the trial of
Policeman James Fogarty. The officer
Is charged with having beaten one Sol
S. Levltus during a free-for-all fight
In front of a restaurant at 251 Taylor
street. The testimony was to the ef
fect that H. Harris, a tailor, and his
wife, were seen to enter .the restaurant
and the man was mistaken for a non
union laborer by some cloakmakers
who were on a strike.
I A committee of two from the cloak
makers visited the restaurant and a
demand was made that the proprietor
desist from feeding "scabs." The lan
guage used on the occasion by the
strikers was exceedingly vulgar. There
were women In the place and the two
' were ordered to leave. Later they re
turned with more strikers and a gen
eral fight commenced. Officer Fogarty
rushed into the crowd, was assaulted
and obliged to use his club. Later the
trouble was renewed and he was
obliged to arrest" Levltus, whom he
took for one of the leaders of the mob,
and who was engaged In a battle with
one of the proprietor's sons.
Levltus says he was not an Insti
gator of the trouble; that he hap
pened to be passing the place when it
began, but he admits that he was on
his way to the cloakhouse to see some
of his friends who. were engaged In the
strike.
Fogarty made an excellent showing
and was clven a fine recommendation
by Chief of Police . Wittman. "I put
him in that district." said the Chief,
"when men of sterling Integrity and
sound Judgment were needed there,
and he has never disappointed me.
Is a first-class officer and I have never
known him to make an unwarranted
arrest or to use his club when It was
not absolutely necessary."
A decision will be rendered at the
end of a week.
The Commissioners revoked the li
cense of Charles D. Long, an employ
ment agent on Clay street Long was
charged with having accepted fees
from laboring men for Jobs that were
not to be had. Five men who -were
but their fare, to the- Rawhide mine
and who had to walk back to this city
told their stories. Many other com
plaints of a similar character have
been made, and the commission in
tends to stop the practice of bunkoing
workingmen out of their last few dol
lars.
Harry Seguine resigned as a special
policeman and was appointed to the.
regular department A request was
made by the attorney for the Public

the Commissioners refused to grant
the request. .

BERKELEY, Dec. 22.â J. W. Rich
ards, the choice of the citizens' bond
cfommittee for chairman, will in a few
days announce the names of the gentle-'
men of his selection for the eight sub
committees that are to Investigate and
report upon the bond issue proposi
tions. As Mr. Richards is not personal
ly acquainted with the qualifications
of the committeemen, he does not know
how to distribute them so that the best
results will be obtained and he will be
assisted by Thomas Rickard, president
of the Board of Trustees, who selected
the whole committee of forty citizens. ;
These sub-committees are expected to
begin work Immediately and be ready
to report at the next meeting of the
committee on the first Monday in Feb
ruary, which will leave ample time to
carry on thorough investigations.
"It Is really too early to say any
thing about the work of the commit
tee," said Mr. Richards to-day. "Bui
with the help of Mr. Rickard I will ap
point committees that will collect data
on the different items proposed for the
bond issue that will be valuable .as
campaign material, If- nothing else.
There can be no doubt that the city is
in need of all-the Improvements spoken
of at last night's meeting, but unless
the greatest care Is exercised in keep-
Ing the proposed bond issue down, the
people will not vote for it The great
est argument that will be used agalnr.t
the bonds will be the burden it will add
to the already heavy taxes, a matter
which was the , theme of several ad
dresses last night."
Not the least important sub-commit
tee will be the one on taxation. It will
be the duty of this committee not only
to ascertain the cost that will be en
tailed by the bonds, but to examine
Into the proposition of consolidation
with Oakland and Alameda into a city
and county government The city and
county government Is gaining converts
even in Berkeley, though a short time
ago the people were for an Independent
city. This change of heart, and
thought Is being brought about by the
argument that the taxea would be re
duced at least $1 on the $100 valuation
If the cost of ' government- Is reducsd.
The city, county and State taxes In
Berkeley this year amounted to S $2 67
on the $100 valuation, which In many
property owners' cases meant paying
double the amount of taxation as last
year. If it can be shown that at least
a dollar will be lopped off this tax rate
by consolidation, there will be a rapid
change of sentiment in regard to keep-
Ing Berkeley a separate city. At any
rate It will be the Important duty of
the sub-committee on taxation to pub
lish figures that will show the advan
tages or disadvantages of Consolida
tion.
A young couple fooled an old one
at U^iah this morning and came to
this city this afternoon and were
married by Justice of the Peace
Quinn. The young groom gave his
age as 22 and his name as Frank H.
Scott. His bride is Miss Alice M.
Howard, and she is just 19. Her fam
ily lives in Ukiah and made strenuous
objections to th.e match upon the gen
eral grounds of the couple's youthful
ness and the inability of the groom to
take up the responsibilities of the
married state.
The young people met the difficulty
by eloping.
While waiting for the Justice to
come to perform the ceremony, Miss
Howard said: "My parents would not
give their consent to our getting mar
ried, so we just came away without
letting them know anything about it."
The young husband said: "My peo
ple liev at Anaheim and we are going
to Los Angeles this evening. From
there I am going to . take ray wife to
my father's home.
"I have been employed In Ukiah for
some time. We wanted to get mar
ried up there, but her father and
mother would not give their consent,
so we just got aboard the train.with
out letting any one know anything
about it. I guess It's too late now to
care, as the deed Is done."

A 1 young, woman whose Identity is
unknown was attacked by a man in
the university grounds while going to
her home, at noon yesterday. The fiend
had evidently singled out his intended
victim, as' he_ lay In wait in a path
usually taken by the young woman in
â¢ going toward North Berkeley. Before
she could escape he grabbed her about
the waist and tried to drag her with
him. She was a match for him, how
ever, and struggled and screamed so
hard that he was at laSt 'glad to re
lease his hold and allow her to go.

In the union, it is sai-1. a plan is being
agitated to bring these matters to an
issue as early as possible, and it is re
ported that the organization intends to
stand firm on the question of its right
to say v, hen a man shall be discharged.
This question formed part of the origin
al demands of the carmen last year,
but was eliminated before the final con
sideration of their case . was under
taken by the board of arbitration. Ac
cording to information gleaned from
men on the lines, the union will present
Jts case to the management of the road
during the month of January.
Much anxiety is being shown by
the management of the United Rail
roads over stories that have been
lately circulated to the effect that
the Carmen's union is preparing to
demand further concessions from the
corporation. Although the represent
atives of both the railroad and the
union decline to discuss, the possibil
ity of further trouble, the report has
been current for several days that the
employes are dissatisfied with the re
cent findings of the board of arbitra
tion and that the officials of the union
lire about to present to Manager Chap
man a series of demands which will
include an increase of wages and the
recognition of the union in the dis
charge and employment of men.
According to the reports in circula
tion the recent ruling of Oscar
Ptraus, awarding the men a sched
ule of wages of 27 Â»Â£, 26 V4. and 25
cents an hour, is proving unsatisfac
tory, in that it is not a sliding sched
ule and has a tendency to demoral
ize th-? organization.
In lieu of the present schedule, it is
said that the men will demand a flat
rate of 33 1-3 cents an hour, which will
place all of the men on an equal foot
ing. Of late the union has declared
that the company has been discharging
employes for alleged infractions of the
rules, but in reality, so it is claimed,
because the men are receiving the
higher rate of wages or because of their
supposed activity in the workings of
lYtp union.
The Governor acted independently of
the Pardon Board, which never took
any action in the case. It was based on
petitions signed by more than 1000 de
positors of the bank.
LANSING. Mich., Dec. 22.â Governor
Bliss said to-night that in granting a
parole to Frank C. Andrews his action
was due to his investigation, which con
vinced him that, if at liberty. Andrews
could materially aid in ending litiga
tion over the affairs of the bank and in
realizing from the assets. Thus he felt
that Andrews could be of great service
to the depositors.
Prosecutor Hunt severely arraigned
Governor Bliss for his action in the
matter.
Prosecuting Attorney O. F. Hunt of
Wayne County said to-night that he
had not been consulted by the Governor
in relation to the parole of Andrews.
Hunt said there were three other
charges pending against Andrews, and
that he would begin at once an investi
gation as to whether Andrews could be
placed on trial on these other charges.
The pending charges are for misappli
cation of the bank's funds and certi
fying a false report to the Banking
Commissioner.
DETROIT, Mich., Dec. 22.â Governor
Bliss has signed a parole for Frank C.
Andrews, former vice president of the

Andrews, who has been confined in the
State prison at Jackson since November
13, 1902, was released to-night, lie was
convicted of misapplication of funds
of the bnnk. The technical charge was
In connection with an $S000-check, but
the evidence Introduced at the trial
covered money and credit of the bank
to the amount of more than $1,500,000,
although the bank's capital was' only
$150,000. The City Savings Bank was
closed February 10, 1902, by the State
Banking Commission and the subse
quent trial of Andrews, who was, at
the time of his arrest, Police Commis
sioner of the city of Detroit, was highly
sensational.

the reports that ' Foreign Secretary
Lansdowne and Foreign Minister Del
casse, within the last few days, have
made strong representations at Tokio
with the view to averting a crisis be
tween Russia and Japan. There is rea
son to believe that those representa
tions, coming at the critical moment
when Japan's reply was being handed
to the Russian Minister, Baron de
Rosen, exercised a powerful restrain
ing influence. This is especially, true
of Lord Lansdov.-ne, owing to Great
Britain being the ally of Japan.
The terms of the Japanese reply are
not yet known here, but, owing to the
action taken by Great Britain and
France, the officials are confident that
her answer permits or a continuance
of the diolomatic negotiations toward

mura called upon Baron de Rosen, the
Russian Minister, yesterday, instead of
Baron de Rosen calling on Komura, is
explained by the fact that the Baron
is suffering from an ear affection. But
the explanation has obvious diplomatic
significance, and is interpreted to mean
that Japan is determined not to afford
Russia possible ground for claiming
Japanese impetuosity as an excuse.
Komura's communication is not be
lieved, officially, to necessarily be tan
tamount to an ultimatum, as rumored.
War preparations continue apace.

Through inquiry by cable of Min
ister Conger at Peking, the State De

Government has not ratified the im

which was ratified by the United States
Senate last week. This information
has caused some uneasiness, as it is
feared that influence is being brought
to bear on China to decline to ratify.
Conger has been instructed to urge
upon the Chinese authorities the ne
cessity of ratifying the treaty so that
it may be made effective at an early
date. Under the terms of the treaty
the Manchurian ports of Moukden,and
Antung are to be opened to foreign

WASHINGTON. Dec. 22. â A great
deal of anxiety is 'expressed in diplo
matic circles in Washington about the
state of affairs in the Far East. The
latest dispatches from Japan indicate
not only a sudden increase in the ex
tent of the Russian demands, but, it is
asserted, added arrogance in the man
ner in which they are presented, not
only in Tokio, but also in Peking and
Seoul.
It appears, according to a statement,
that Russia has steadily increased the
exigency of her demands ever since
last August; that while pretending to
take into consideration the moderate
and reasonable suggestions of Japan,
every fresh instruction* from St .Peters
burg has been couched in terms more
and more exacting, till at last it is
hard to resist the conclusion that Rus
sia has* determined to force the issue
of hostilities upon Japan without fur
ther delay.
She now absolutely refuses to dis
cuss with Japan the question of the in
tegrity of China or the equality of
commercial opportunity there, claim
ing at the same time a division of
spheres of influence in Korea.
The explanation which is generally
given among diplomats in Washington
is that the Russian Government must
have made arrangements for at least
benevolent neutrality with Germany,
and this is borne, out by Chancellor
von Bulow's reply to Herr Bebel on
December 10, in which, \Â«hen chal
lenged by the Socialist Deputy with
complicity in the Russian scheme of
aggrandizement, Von Bulow persist
ently refused to deny that there was
such understanding, but announced
the entire indifference of Germany to
anything that Russia might do in
China.

No money was found on the body and
no trace of the man's hat could be dis

It Is possible that Mclntyre may have
committed suicide, for one end of the

into the water there he could have in

Covina officers cannot account for the
money which the man. is known to
have had upon his 'person, nor was
there any known reason for suicide.
Mclntyre had lived alone near
Covina for years and had no relatives
in this part of the country. He was
formerly a prospector, but for years
had engaged in ranching on rented
land. The Sheriff's officers who were

TACOMA, "Wash., Dec. 22.â Between
.Saturday night and Sunday morning
*3. huge hole, 100 feet deep by four feet
in diameter, mysteriously appeared in
the garden of Edmund Morton's resi
dence, on G street, opposite, the Court
, house. The cause of this strange col
lapse of earth remains a mystery after
three days of investigation by Morton's
family, their neighbor? and many oth
ers who have visited the spot.
Several weeks ago a slight depression
Â¦was noticed on the lawn on the south
Fide of the house, the sod sinking over
a space about four feet in diameter.
This depression deepened into a small
hole, in which the children of the
neighborhood amused themselves by
leaping and trying to secrete them
selve*. Not until Sunday did any one
drram ct the narrow escapes these lit
tle ones had from death.
Saturday night the hole was as it had
been for some time. Nothing in its
appearance suggested a subterranean
passage. The heavy rains of the past
two wwks are believed to have some
connection with the otherwise unex
plained phenomenon. Water running
along some underground stratum had
removed the supporting earth. Satur
day night the upper layers of dirt in'the
hole were carried away.
} Underground rivers are numerous in
this section, being frequently struck
by well borers on the gravel prairie
south of Tacoma. Some think this hole
resulted directly from such cause,
others believe that in early days an old
wen existed there and was subsequently
filled in. No evidence of such well has
yet been obtained.

Minor Discharged from Marine Corps.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.âIn the Su
preme Court of the .District of Colum
bia to-day Justice Claybaugh granted
the petition of George F. Harris' for
a writ of habeas corpus to secure the
discharge of his son. Harry F. Harris
of thÂ« United States Marine Corps, on
the ground that the boy was but 17
jears of age.- The court held that tha
etatute permitting the enlistment in
the nary of boys between 14 and 18
S'tars of age does not apply to the Ma
rine Corps, and that the Supreme Court
af the District of Columbia has-declded
in effect that a minor cannot be en
'.isted in the Marine Corps without the
consent of his parents or guardian.
"If the guarantee "of neutrality were
to be looked upon as a privilege It
would urcvent the sovereign govern
ment from keeping order on the isth
mus, which is against the principles of
all governments."
"If ths explanation the United States
Government has given to the press is
of a diplomatic character answer clear
ing the following points:
"By the treaty of 1846 the United
States did not acquire control over in
teroceanic transit, but entered into ob
ligations by which, for compensatory
favor*, it guaranteed the neutrality, of
property and sovereignty of the isth
mus, the sovereignty being indivisible.
. "If the United States Government
prevents the Government of Colombia
from subduing the rebels, then it ought
to submit them to Colombian authority.
"The United States has never pro
tected Colombia against foreign inva
sions. Whenever that Government has
interfered to orevent the interruption
of traffic it has been because of the
rights granted or on Colombia's request
only. Only in this instance has it in
terfered on its own initiative, with the
evident object of protecting the seces
sionists on the isthmus.
The Government and the people hope
that the United States Congress will
avoid a conflict and they rely upon the
fairness of the AmeNcan press.
Dr. Luis Carlos Rico, Minister of For
eign Affairs, has cabled, to General
Reyes at Washington under date of
December 6 as follows:
BOGOTA, Friday, Dec. 18.â Patriotic
meetings" are" "being held here every
evening, at which contingents of men
and sums of money are offered to the
Government. Even the women demand
to be enlisted for the purpose of jro
injr to Panama to subdue the separat
ists.
The Government only waits news
from General Reyes and if that news
is to the effect that nothing can be
accomplished by diplomatic means,
then the authorities will continue to
send troops toward the Isthmus."

CHICAGO, Dec. '22.â Charged with
operating in the center of the fashion
able shopping district of Chicago, a
distillery, contrary to 'Government reg
ulations, five officers, and instructors
of the Columbus laboratories were to
day arrested by United States Deputy
Marshals. One of the five prisoners
was United States Commissioner Salo
mon. The laboratories are located in
a skyscraper office building in State
street at the corner of Washington.
The arrests were made on complaint
of United States Revenle Agent Levi
G. Nutt, the technical charge being
"displaying the sign. of a distiller and
making a mash fit for distillation in a
place other than a duly authorized
disti\lery."
' To-day's arrests are doubtless the
outgrowth of a 'bill for injunction filed
recently in the United' States District
Court against Dr. Evans, Dr. Gehr

ers charging them with conducting a
school wherem pupils were taught to
manufacture imitations of various

CHAIRMAN OF THE ISTHMIAN CANAL COMMISSION, WHO HAS
RETURNED FROM PANAMA WITH AN OPTIMISTIC REPORT AS
TO^THE PREVAILING CONDITIONS.
Embapsador Clayton has reported to
the Department of State that of forty
three cases of American railway men
arrested since June. 1901. thirty-eight
have been disposed of. and in three of
the remaining five the men who were
released on bail fied to the United
States. In two instance? only are pro
ceeding? still pending-
It is observed that of the forty-three
persons arrested fourteen were arrested
for offenses not cu-nnected with the
movement of trains, and the percent
age of arrests of Americans employed
in' Mexico is only .033. while that of
Mexicans is .046 and of all other na
tionalities .063.
As a consequence of Embassador
Clayton's representations to the Mexi
can Foreign Office an important cir
cular letter has been issued by the
Mexican Department of Justice and
s-^nt to the District and Circuit courts
throughout that republic, advising
against the arrest and imprisonment
of such railway employes, except on
a etrong presumption of guilt, and di
recting them in all cases to expedite
the judicial proceedings. Provision is
made for the release of the accused on
bail whenever the nature of the offense
will permit it.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 22.â Complaints
having reached the State Department
from many sources during the last
few years that American citizens em
ployed in various capacities on the rail
roads of Mexico frequently had- been
arrested and imprisoned in that repub
lic on charges of criminal negligence
in railway wrecks, homicides, etc., and
hÂ»ld for long periods without trial, the
United States Embassador for Mexico
was directed by Secretary Hay to ex
amine into these cases and bring the
subject to the attention of the Mexican
Government, with a view to amelior
ating the conditions which appeared to
exist.
At the Navy Department the state
ment is made to-night that the instruc
tions to the naval commander in isth
mian waters to "prevent the landing of
forces with hostile Intent," have -not
been modified. These instructions are
sufficiently comprehensive to enable the
commanders to maintain open transit
across the isthmus and to protect the
new republic from Colombian expedi
tions. â¢ - . J
This statement was made to-night
by a Europeah Embaesador of . high
rank. It has already been made in
substance, though in rather more dip
lomatic language, to General Rafael
Reyes^the Colombian Minister, who isi
expected in his forthcoming note to the
State Department to suggest Th3
Hague tribunal as the proper place
for the settlement of the isthmian
problem. Whether the knowledge that
the refusal of such a request, so far
from prejudicing the European powers
against the Washington Government,
will call forth their emphatic indorse
ment, will cause General Reyes to
modify his note, is not yet certain.
The Embassador quoted, in explain
ing the attitude of the European pow
ers, said:
"Panama is a closed chapter in the
history of nations, and The Hague
court is not the place for settled ques
tions, but for pending problems, which
are referred to it with the approval of
all the parties interested. When Rus
sia, Germany and France recognized
the independence of Panama they set
their seal of approval on the prompt
action of the Washington Government
in pledging itself to guarantee sjjid
maintain the independence of the re
public it had previously recognized.
"Nations can hardly be expected to
settle questions of sovereignty or na
tional honor at The Hague. Moreover,
Â¦in my opinion, it would not be within
the province, of the "VVasnington Gov
ernment to grant such a request from
'Colombia. It is to Panama, not to
Washington", that Colombia should take
such a proposition.
"There is, however, a question be
tween Colombia and Panama which
with all propriety might be referred to
The Hague and to which reference the
United States" will scarcely offer ob
jection. It is the question of the, as
sumption by Panama of a part of the
Colombian debt. If General Reyes
should ask the United States to use its
good-offices to have tlils matter brought
before The Hague, Panama misht safe
ly acquiesce in such a proposition. The
difficulty in making this request would
be that Colombia thereby would recog
nize the independence of the new re
public, but .this must come sooner or
later.". . â¢:-.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.â "Refusal
by the United States to consent to a
proposition from Colombia for a refer
once of the Panama question to The
Hague tribunal is expected and will be
fully approved by ; the Kuropean"pow
ers." . .'.. . . , - -
ST. PAUL, Dec. 22.â Archbishop Ire
land received to-dav, under date of
December 22, a cablegram from Mon-_
signor Ouidi; A*postolic Delegate to the
Philippines, announcing that the last
touch had just been put on, the con
tract between the United States Gov
ernment of the islands and the' church
for the purchase of the friar lands In
the Islands and inviting the Arch
bishop to rejoice with him on ' the
happy conclusion of the negotiations.
Referring to the cablegram Archbishop
Ireland said:
"I want to add to this my
of great pleasure at the termination of
the long-drawn negotiations by the
sale of these lands in the Philippines.
All praise must be awarded to Gov
ernor Taft and Monsigmor Guidl, who
have labored .hard to bring all parties
interested in this matter to a final
understanding. From the time of the
arrival of Monsignor Guidi in the isl
ands there has beep - the warmest
friendship between him and the Phil
ippine Government. The disposal of
the lands, together with the arrival of
the American Bishops ..in . the Islands,
puts an end to all political religious
controversies in the Philippines and
inaugurates there an* era of civil and
religious peace.
"The administration of President
Roosevelt is to be congratulated on the
present condition of things in the isl
ands. It was his wisdom and fore
thought that caused Governor' Taft,
some eighteen months ago, to visit
Rome and talk directly with the head
of the church about the friar lands
matter/ Pope Leo and Governor Taft
showed themselves to be of one mind
as to the main lines of the policy to be
followed. The negotiations then begun
in Rome were afterward transferred to
the Philippines, where Mgr. Guidi con
tinued the prudent and far-sighted pol
icy of his master, Pope Leo XIII.
â¢ "That henceforward the church in the
islands will be well taken care of
Catholics and Protestants may confi
dently believe. The Americans now
presiding over the sees in the islands
will know what course will be the
best and will follow that course.
"We in the States may leave to them
the interests of religion as we leave to
Governor Wright, Governor Taffs suc
cessor, the interests of civil govern
ment., All agitation and anxiety re
garding church matters in the islands
now ceases and. we are all glad that
this is the case."

Regal shoes bear the same impress of free-hand
drawing that the etcher's needle leaves upon his copper
plate.
The custom individuality of Regal Shoes can be ob-
tained only by skilled hand labor. The soles are roughly
cut by machinery, but the finishing touches are all added
by hand.
Each trimmer is an artist. He shaves off. a little of
this side, and a little on that, until the straight lines scid
the curves blend artistically into each other. The result
is the distinctive air, the " Custom Appearance " peculiar
to Regals, and other hand-made shoes.
But free hand drawing is expensive. It costs the
Regal Shoe Co. $30,000 a year extra merely to trim the
edges by hand, instead of by machinery.
Is it worth while ? Other .manufacturers say " no."
We say "yes," for it adds indibiduality to Regal Shoes.
And the public seem to agree with us. I
We believe in style, but we believe even more in
comfort. No matter how radical the shape or how ex-
treme the lines, Regal Shoes always fit and the price is
always the same, $3.50.

City Attorney Lane has advised the
local Board of Supervisors to Inform
the Sacramento Board of Supervisors
that he will assist in defense of an ac
tion brought by De Camp & Mosher on
an alleged infringement of letters
patent in the use of crude petroleum
oil in the construction of roadways.
Lane doubts the wisdom of making a
financial contribution for the employ
ment of special counsel, inasmuch as
it would establish a precedent that
other .counties would follow.
"The city would find itself embar
rassed," says Lane in his opinion, "by
frequent requests for such financial
assistance from the various counties
of the State. This city has defended
a large number of cases which the
other political subdivisions of the
State were interested In and have
profited by â notably, for instance, the
litigation growing out of the taxation
of national bank stock â but it has
sought no assistacne from other cities
and counties. I further question the
power of the Board of Supervisors to
appropriate any money for the con
duct of litigation to which this city is
not a party." t
Advises Supervisors Xot to Contribute
to Expenses of Suit Against Sacra

Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient dis-
infectant and purifier in nature, but few
realize its value when taken into the
human system for the same cleansing
purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the bettey; it is. not a
drug at' all,' but simply absorbs the
gases arid impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Â¦ Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and furthes acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the Injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth. and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoaU in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal and other harmless an-
tiseptics in tablet form or rather in the
form of large, pleasant tasting lozen-
ges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
Roorf tell in a. much improved'condition
of tlKe general health, better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer* blood,
and the beauty of it is that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use, but, on the contrary,. great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefitsof charcoal says: "I advise
Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering from gas in^ stomach
and bowels and to clear the complexion
and purify, the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is greatly
benefited by the dally use of them;
they, cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug gtores, and although |n some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I get
more iand. 'better, charcoal in Stuart's
Absorbent Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

in Preserving Health and Beauty.

ENFANT TERRIBLE â Subscriber.
City. The French phrase, "enfant ter
rible," does not mean a wild younsr
rascal, as many suppose, nor doe3 it
mean an ungovernable, unmanageable
or terrible child, but a child that, by
ill-timed remarks, innocently made,
causes others to have terrible or ter
ribly annoying feelings; as for in
stance, a child may say, on seeing an
individual who unexpectedly enters the
house at dinner time, "Oh. Mr.
Blank, I didn't think you'd come here
to-day; mamma said she hoped you
wouldn't 'come, as you come here too
oiÂ£en." The -feelings of Blank and of
the mother can be appreciated.
It is said on what appears to be excellent authority
that neither Japan nor Russia may indulge its evident
desire to leap at the other's throat for the very good rea
son that neither can borrow the money necessary for
war. Occasionally this commercial age of ours vindi
cates itself by preventing even nations from making
fools of themselves. International bankers in their re
fusal to lend money in this affair have done a service to
humanity. . " >
Now, taking it for eranted that the

thus learned is never forgotten, and is

hears it played in its finished state, but
is a valuable aid to the pupil in the

In sight reading, however, one would
accomplish nothing if one stopped to
carefully remove all the fla\ys that are
liable to appear during the first at
tempts in this new field, and the pupil
must try to prrasp the music as a whole,
in the impressionistic style, rather than
to seek to go into detail. A little later,
as he becomes more at ease m reading
at eight, he will naturally take in more

TO GET RID OP ANTSâ Subscriber,
City. The following Is given as a
means to get rid of ants: "Houses af
fected with ants, black or red, may
be cleared of them by a little atten
tion. A sponge is one of the best
things. Sprinkle it with dry white
granulated sugar; the sponge being
slightly moist, it will adhere. The ant3
will go into the cells of the spongo
in large numbers after the sugar. They
can be destroyed by immersing the
sponge Into boiling water. The sponge
can then be squeezed and sugared
again, and the process repeated until
the last ant has been caught.". 1;
MAY MARRIAGESâ J. W. City,
The supposition that- marriages in Matf
are unlucky has been traced to the an
cient Romans. Those people held tha
festival of Lemuria during: three days
of that month to propitiate the spirits
of the departed Â» and considered the
whole month unlucky because of that
festival. "Mense malo malae num
bent" was one of their proverbs. Thla
means, "In May evils marry."
It would be well. -to. let the boy try
his "contrary motion" on the scale of
G, occasionally, for the sooner he be
comes accustomed to sharps, the bet
ter. Moreover, his scale practice will
be much more Interesting to him if it
goes, hand in hand with his study- of
written music, arid whenever he attacks
a new key, in exercise of piece, I should
advise practicing hid scales in that par
ticular key. that all things may work
together. -
After giving him an idea of the uses
of "flats," by this same method let him
look through his instruction book and
find "sharps," "fiats" and "naturals"
for you until he is perfectly familiar
with them all.
/ In addition to this, let him now take
up the scale of G, and from now on
divide up his scale practice between the
two scales, C and G." He must take the
scale "of G In exactly the same way
that he did C,' first in "ones," then
"twos," then "threes," and practicing
it with the metronome faithfully.
By this time he should have become
proficient endugh In iscale of C to play
it with perfect ease at the metronome
50. Therefore let him hereafter play it
at CO, while playing the scale of G at 50.
This applies to both hands of course,
although they are still to be practiced
separately. '-;.'Â¦
Tell him that the only key that has
no. sharps or flats is the key of C â that
is, the key that all his scales and exer
cists have been written In hitherto. It
is time for him to know something
about the other keys, however, and it
would be well to let him draw a staff,
divided into a number of measures,
with a simple "time" sign at the left,
by the clef sign. Now let him place a
sharp on the top line of the staff at
the extreme left. This makes the key
he is writing in the key of G. Let him
now write a number of notes, enough to
13 11 out the measures, and sprinkle in a
plentiful number of fs, so that he may
come to ; understand the use of the
eharp. Let him put irÂ» a number of
naturals, too, explaining to him at the
same time that , the "natural" sign
holds good only to the end of the meas
ure.
ish out the exercise with e, d and c.
Let him try this with different groups
of notes, always being careful to have
some note therein that is first to be
played with a sharp and then made
"natural" the next time it is played.
Now explain to him that in case there
is a sharp written at the beginning of
the staff beside the clef sign "and the
"time" sign, it means that that partic
ular note must be sharped every time
it is Etruck during the whole exercise,
unless there is a natural sign put in
somewhere.

THE Weather Bureau of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture at Washington has just pub
lished a remarkably comprehensive bulletin upon
"The Climatology of California," the work of Professor
Alexander G. McAdie, district forecaster of the Weather
Bureau in this city. Through the courtesy of the author
The Call is in receipt of a copy of this extensive review
of climatic conditions in the State. Even from a lay
man's point of view a perusal of the work of Professor
McAdie makes manifest its value to agriculturists,, and
all those whose business is dependent upon the rise and
fall of rivers.
Aside from its strictly technical information and the
minutely tabulated -statistics of rainfall and temperature
changes, McAdie's bulletin contains some interesting
facts upon the very paradoxes which are found to be
characteristic of California climatology. 1 "Though our
stretch of territory from north to south corresponds with
a like strip of the Atlantic seaboard from Boston to
Savannah, a difference, in the mean annual temperature
of ten degrees only. exists between San Diego and "Sis
kiyou counties. At Eureka the mean temperature
throughout the year is 51 degrees, at San Francisco 56
degrees, at San Diego 61. Yet we 'have the extremes
of Sahara ami Greenland; In the Salton desert the maxi
mum thermometer has registered -as high as 130 de
grees in the shade; yet within 'three hundred miles of
that point, at Bodie, on the summit of the Sierra, the
freshening breezes have registered as low 'as 30 degrees
below zero./ â¢ ' Â¦ kÂ»;
Though it is certain that no other State in the Union
can offer such admirable conditions for a Hammara
bath on a large" scale, McAdie's bulletin demonstrates it
to be also the fact that nobody can approach us for ups
and downs in topography. , Mount Whitney, the highest

In the -variety of ways by which Colombia seeks the
attention of the world she has declared that she will
fight to restore Panama to her unenviable former asso

CRITICS 'have exhausted their" ability in passing
judgment on the works of Emil Zola. It is the
deliberate opinion of France that his "La Terre"
libels the French peasantry, and there have been serious
objections in religious circles to his "Faute de l'Abbe
Mouret." But Zola is dead, and his last years were full
of lurid experiences derived fom his "J'accuse" letter on
the Dreyfus case.
Death and judgment .nave not caused examination and
criticism of his work to cease. Down in Ybor City,
Florida, two critics met and discussed the obscenity of
one of Zola's books. We regret that the critical com
munion of the. Republic of Letters is not informed by
the Associated Press which novel was in controversy,
but, as Zola managed to be risque in most of his books,
perhaps this makes no difference.
The Ybor critics were Jesus Fernandez, a Spaniard,
and itnrique Velasquez, a Mexican. They discussed with
their bare fists, and when time was called Zola's work
had not yet been decided to be obscene or pure. In
pursuit of higher criticism the two literary champions
met next day and resumed the discussion with revolvers.
Jesus got in the first argument to prove obscenity, and
Enrique fell at the second fire. But the champion of
Zola's purity raised on his elbow,- and although his op
ponent's arguments had made five bullet holes in him,
his vindicatory revolver put the Spaniard out and com
pelled his retrea/into the shelter of a saloon, whence he
emerged prepared to resume the debate with fervor and
a dagger. >
Meantime the riddled Mexican had got upon his feet,
and opened fire again, proving that in literary criticism
the pistol is mightier than the knife. The Spaniard
found himself unable to respond, and the Mexican quit
and died winner. The Spaniard was taken away and at
last reports Avas expected to die during the night. It is
a pity that Zola died so soon, for this method of deter
mining whether his pen makes the greater contribution
to vice or virtue would have appealed to his imagination
and his method.
It is a pity too that the arguments put forward in this
debate were so evenly matched. The incident transfers
the seat of literary criticism from Boston to Yb'or City,
and it is to be hoped that the good work will proceed in
the new seat of learning and literary judgment. If Zola
have many friends in'Ybor it behooves them to stock up
with citations of the latest pattern, self-cocking and hair
trigger action, and to keep their cartridge belts full of
phrases. His enemies there will have learned that de
bate with a dagger puts them at a disadvantage, and the
great " discussion may proceed with the critics more
evenly matched.

It was at a recent graduating enter
tainment of trained nurses who had
just received their diplomas from the
City and County Hospital that a well
known city official was made the vic
tim of a joke that caused immense
amusement during the entire evening.
The official's name shall be "Devo
~tion" for the occasion. As soon as the
evening's entertainment was set in mo
tion by a promenade Dr. McElroy, the
â¢superintendent, introduced Mr. Devo
tion to a young person who was
known as Miss Bine. The gallant De
votion was charmed at the introduc
tion, as Miss Bine was the handsomest
trained nurse in the room. She hooked
on to Mr. Devotion's arm with a
charming grace and they were soon
in the mazy dance. She coquetted
fiercely with him, looking up into his
face and sending one of those soul
I piercing glances right at him. To be
brief Devotion was captivated. His
heart was gone; he confessed it to his
personal friends, but with the admoni
tion not to let the fair charmer know
I it as she might decline on such a short
acquaintance.
The secret was kept until just be
fore the breaking up of the entertain
ment when Miss Bine had the rude
ness .to strip off her nurse's costume
right In the midst of the select as
semblage. Lo, the fair coquette was
none other than a young doctor, an
interne at the hospital. What became
of Mr. Devotion is not known as he

Not -long ago Dr. Frizzell of tha

to be no reason why the region in
which perfect carcasses have been
kept on ice should not contain the

An expedition to Patagonica to

University of Berlin is now searching
for the living creature itself.

this district, one stone weighing sixty
seven carats. It is a peculiar belief of
the natives that the gold and diamonds
in the earth are a sort of bank and
should be worked only when they
themselves need money, tlnce they be
lieve that gold and diamonds are al
ways there when they desire them. Tha
great Borneo diamond of Mattam, said
to weigh 367 carats, is believed to bo
from this same region.
Against this is the brief statement made by President
Jordan in his recent lecture on "The Call of the Twen
tieth Century." He said: "The greatest discovery of
the twentictli century will be that a straight line is the
shortest distance between two points. This means de
mocracj'. The century calls for the man who can kick
the goal, build the road, write the book. " Democracy
means equality of start, the best education for all, a fair
chance to the son of the poor man. It does not mean
equality of achievement. Horse races start even, but
the horses do not finish' even except where you handi
cap the best animals. 'America is a country of perpetual
inequalities, because it gives an even start to all."
That statement supplements Spencer and is needfully
explanatory. Civil liberty is that" condition in which all
men start even, which means equality of opportunity,
but not equality of achievement, since achievement is un
equal as the individuals are unequal in capacity, indus
try, thrift and temperance.* When the benefit of his
skill, strength and capacity is denied to any man, he is
deprived of his civil rights, he is handicapped in the race
in order to reduce him to the level of those who are in
ferior in skill, strength and capacity. This leveling pro
cess finally conquers the desire of men to excel, and so
ciety stands still, and then retrogrades. Â£
It is no argument against the views of Spencer or Jor
dan to say that open socialism spreads, and that its col
lateral lines in which the handicapping is already prac
ticed are so strong that in this country the individual -is
beginning to doubt whether the law is powerful enough
to protect his rights. Time was that chattel slavery
gained such headway that it existed under the jurisdic
tion of all the powerful governments, and republics,
kingdoms, empires and principalities indorsed the chat
telhood of man. It was entrenched in theology and sup
ported by religion, but now it is denounced by the same
powers as a crime, and is forbidden everywhere on the
earth. It is only natural that the same human- tendency
that canonized chattel slavery should return and plague
mankind by again renewing over men some form of ar
bitrary control, but against it-stands the belief of the
people in Lincoln's saying that "no man was ever good
enough to govern another man."
Socialism proceeds by -various propaganda, one of
its arguments being that what it calls "capitalism" has
produced all of the existing inequalities of condition. In
a harangue to the striking miners in Colorado, a leader
of them said: "Those mines belong to you, and so do
every house in this city, and every stock of goods, and
every dollar in the banks. It is your right to seize it all,
and that you do not is due entirely to your own modera
tion."
THERE is a socialist propaganda in this country
that is not called socialism. Herbert Spencer
characterized socialism as a form of- slavery^ a sys
tem in which finally the many would be subjected to the
will and control of the few. It is a system that differs
widely from a condition of civil liberty. No man has
liberty when he is compelled to submit, or willingly sub
mits, to the arbitrary will of another. If he work under
that arbitrary direction, or quits work when it orders
him, not^ himself knowing why, except that he is or
dered 1 , he is deprived of civil liberty: If he do this
willingly he is a voluntary slave, no matter tfhat high
sounding name be given to his condition.

Quickly the little one turned her head

Little Maria Luigenetti wanted a
doll for Christmas. She knew that her
mother, who went away for the whole
day and worked for the bread that
they ate. would have no" silver to buy
that angelic vision of white and lace
which stood in the window of the
store down near Washington square.
Her father she only saw at nights
when he returned from the wine shop
and too often she saw the blows which
he struck upon that bent back of the
mother. He buy a doll â Impossible.
The mother had sometimes taken lit
tle Maria to the big cathedral and
taught her to pray before the beau
tiful golden images all set around with
candles. She had told the tiny girl
that there was a good mother in heav
en who answered the prayers of those
who sought her. How many times the
little waif, left alone In the dingy room
which was her home, pictured to her
self this radiant lady. Sitting there in
the half light which filtered through
the smeared window, Maria bethought
herself of seeking her doll through the
kindness of this wondrous vision of the
lights.
From the wall in her mother's room
she took down the gaudy print of the
Virgin. Then upon the top of a cracker

the flag; a stump of a candle and a

from the neighbor's window box com

Then in the flickering lLght of that
stump of a candle the child prayed
aloud to the- Virgin: "O blessed lady,

Quite Â«?arly in his progress through
his instruction book he will come to
sharps and fiats, and it will be well
right here to explain to him that a
sharp raises a note half a tone and a
flat lowers it. Show him the flat and
sharp signs, and let him draw them
until he has fixed them in his memory.
Also the "natural" sign, which is used
to bring the note back to its normal
place after it has been sharped. Have
the child illustrate this himsejf by
drawing the staff, then placing the
notes, c, d, e, f, g, upon it. Tell him
to put the sharp sign in front of (that
is, to the left of) f before he writes g.
Now, after writing g, let him continue
along the staff by writing another f.
This time, however, he must make a
"natural" before the f, showing that it
is not to be sharped. Then let him fin-
The numbers at the beginning of the
staff always signify what the "time"
of the piece is to be, as, for instance,
2-4 means that two quarter notes are
to be counted to each measure. :
These things are all to be taken grad
ually,' and care must be taken not to
ciowd the pupil too m"uch and so con
fute him.
Let him practice this exactly as he
has been in the habit v of practicing his
one-hand" scale â that is, in one, two
and three octaves respectively, wJth the
accompanying accents, as previously
explained in. other lessons. This must
not be done to the exclusion of his reg
ular scale practice, however, but in ad
dition to it.'
It is not necessary to go into all the
details of "time," and so forth, for if
the pupil understands fully the proper
ties of whole notes, quarter notes, and
so on, all of which were explained in
the last lesson, he can easily follow out
the working of his instruction book,
with the aid of a little simple arithme
tic; for instance, one quarter note is
equal to two eighth notes, and so on.
Examples of eighth notes (they are just
like a quarter note only that there Is a
little curve attached to the stem) are
given in the illustration.
Let him place both thumbs on "mid
dle C" and proceed to play his scale
with both hands, going in an opposite
direction toward each end of the piano,
the left hand playing the descending
scale at the same time the right hand
is playing the ascending scale. ' i
may trouble him a little to conquer the
natural dependence of one hand on, the
other, and it will help him to acquire
the desired independence if at this time
he takes ud the "contrary motion" in
his scales.
JORDAN ON SOCIALISM.
But in the Colombian Congress were the Morgans, Gor
mans and Daniels who concluded to make politics out
of the defeat of the treaty. They defeated it, and the
Panama revolution followed.
Our own Senators might be in better business than
the imitation of Colombian methods. But if they choose
that kind of statesmanship they are. independent of any
control except by public opinion, and for the present that
can only find expression through the press, and its
.authoritative declaration can only be made at the polls
next November. We are well assured that the issue
they make will work both ways. The strong financial
interests in this country which oppose the canal will go
with the Democracy and will slightly divide the Repub
lican partjt But the issue will also divide the Democ
racy.
In view of the history of the canal project Senators
Morgan. Gorman and Daniel are taking a great respon
sibility, for it is no less than the responsibility of de
feating a canal entirely. Their action presents an emer
gency in which the commercial bodies and the citizens
of the country should be heard. The President has -done
his duty by taking advantage of a situation for which
Colombia is responsible. Having done all that the con
stitution gives him to do, the issue is thrown upon the
Senate. Those who are so confident of the destructive
effect upon the President of what they call a vote of
want of confidence should remember that our political
history furnishes instances in which Presidents, denied
the confidence of the Senate, have had the confidence of
the .people.
These same Senators were earnest in denying the
confidence of the Senate to Mr. Cleveland on the money
issue, but the election of 1896 indorsed his side of the
issue, though to do so' the people had to elect a Repub
lican successor to him. This time such indorsement will
require the election of President Roosevelt to succeed
himself, and the cabal of opposition Senators should
learn bj' experience that the people are not to be de
ceived nor be misled from the main question by their
attempts to create a party issue.

The dismissal of the suit of the

against the receiver appointed by the

SUIT AGAINST EPPIXGERS
DISMISSED BY CONSENT
Although Brent has been in this city
for several weeks he carefully guarded
his secret until yesterday, when he
found it necessary to make confession
of his matrimonial tie in completing
arrangements for the welcoming of
Mrs. Brent. About ten months ago the
mining man gave out the information
that he was going abroad for health
and pleasure, and a few weeks later
witnessed his departure for the other
side of the world, whence he frequently
made his presence there known to his
friends here tltrough the medium of the
postal-card fad. It is now developed
that one of the pleasures contemplated
by him in the preparations for his for
eign trip was his marriage to a hand
some and well-known young woman
of Chicago, who, .with her mother,
started for Europe about the time he
I left San Francisco. They met in Lon-
Ldon early in April and their marriage
quickly followed, and then began the
tour which finally ended in Chicago,
where, as stated before, Brent left his
wife for a few weeks, in order that
he might transact some business
matters in this city.
Mrs. Brent is being accompanied to
the city by her mother, who will in
the future share the home of her.
daughter and son-in-law.
James A. Brent, the well-known
mining man, who has resided at the
Palace Hotel for several years, gave
the clerks of that hostelry and his
many friends about town a pleasant
surprise yesterday, when he quietly an
nounced that he had been married, and
that Mrs. Brent would arrive from
Chicago to-day. The most interesting
feature of the news is that the mar
riage was celebrated last April, abroad,
and was followed by ! the usual wed
ding trip on the Continent, after which
husband and wife parted in Chicago,
while he proceeded on to this city to at
tend to important business matters and
incidentally arrange for the future
home of himself and bride.
H. J. Parkison, a grandnephew of
Mrs. Sarah Woodward, who was re
cently^ appointed her guaridan, has
been cited to appear in Department 9
of the Superior Court Friday, January
8, to show cause why his letters of
guardianship should not be revoked.
He is also ordered to bring to court
his aged ward. The citation was is
sued yesterday on complaint of J. R.
Lewis, a lifelong friend of Mrs. Wood
ward and one of the trustees of her
large estate, who, in . an affidavit,
charges that Parkison, in order that he
and several other relatives of the aged
woman might benefit themselves finan
cially, have spirited her away from her
comfortable and peaceful home in the
Santa Clara Valley, enticed her to this
city, and by making false statements
to the court concerning her residence,
secured legal control of her person.
According 'to Lewis' affidavit, Mrs.
Woodward was visited by Parkison and
J. R. Hamlet, another relative,/ at her
cozy and pretty home in Cottage Park,
Santa Clara County, laBt November.
They pretended, he says, that a grand
niece of hers was very anxious to have
her come to this city to spend Thanks
giving with her and by this means pre
vailed upon Mrs. Woodward to leave
her peaceful abode and come to this
city. A few days thereafter Parkison
filed a petition to be appointed her
guardian, claiming in his petition that
she was a legal resident of San Fran
cisco and that she possessed an estate
that needed better attention than she,
because of her extreme age, could give.
Continuing, Lewis claims that there
was no necessity for any such proceed
ing. He says that her estate is under
the care of himself, Dr. Eli McClish
and Jeremiah Letter, and has been
cared for by them for the last two
years, or ever since Mrs. Woodward
deeded it to them to hold in trust for
her. Her every want is provided for,
says Lewis, by the trustees out of the
income from the property and from an
annuity of ?600 paid her by Henry
French. Upon her death, avers Lewis,
by the terms of the trust deed the re
mainder of her fortune is to go to the
University of the Pacific.

SERVICES ARE SIMPLE
Last Rites Are Attended by
Many of the State's Leading
Meii in the Legal Fraternity
The funeral of the late Judge John
Haynes took place from his late resi
dence at the St. Nicholas Hotel yes
terday.
The funeral service was read by Rev.
W. K. Guthrie of the First Presby
terian Church, who also made a few
appropriate remarks. A male quartet
sang "Nearer, My God, to Thee" and
"Peace, Be Still." Among the large
number of members of the legal fra
ternity that was present to pay honor
to the memory of the dead jurist were
his old friends, late Chief Justice John
Currey and Superior Judge Coffey.
Among the floral tokens was a beauti
ful broken wheel wrought in violets
and white roses sent by the Union
League Club and a wreath of violets
from the Supreme Court Commission
ers. At the conclusion of the services
the funeral party followed the remains
to Mountain View Cemetery in Oak
land, where the interment took place.
Following were' the honorary pallbear
ers:
Chief Justice Beatty, Justice Van
Dyke, Justice McFarland, Justice Hen
shaw, N. P. Chlpman, Wheaton A.
Gray, J."A. Cooper, George H. Smith,
Judge Niles Searls and L, S. Sherman.
May Succeed Late Judge Ilaynes.
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 22.â Judge Al
bert G. Burnett of the Sonoma County
Superior Court may be selected Su
preme Court Commissioner to succeed
the late Judge Haynes. It is under
stood here that practically all of the
members of the supreme bench desire
Judge Burnett to accept the high honor.
He is being urged by messages from
the metropolis to consider the matter
favorably. At the urgent request of
members of the Supreme Court Judge
Burnett went to San Francisco this
afternoon to confer in regard to the
matter. Many friends here will be
sorry to lose Judge Burnett should he
decide to accept the new position, but
they will be glad to know of any honor
that may be conferred upon him. Judge
Burnett is an able jurist and is now
entering upon his second term as Judge
of the Superior Court. He is one of
the most prominent members of the
legal fraternity -in -Northern California.
Resumes Old Schedule.
It was announced by the Southern
Pacific passenger department yesterday
that, on December 29, the
company will resume its former sched
ule for the operating of passenger
trains between this city and San Jose.
In August last, when tne company be
gan to find its lines congested with
freight trains that could not be moved
owing to the scarcity of motive power,
it took off a number of trains running
between here and the Garden City.
Since then the congested conditions
have been greatly relieved and appre
ciating the need of a better service be
tween the points mentioned, where ths
local traffic has maintained itself in a
surprising manner, it has decided to in
crease the number of trains.
Will Give Benefit Performance.
It has been determined by Golden
Gate Council No. 80 of the Commercial
Travelers' Association to dispense with
its annual ball and banquet this year
and .instead it will give a theatrical
benefit in the form of a minstrel enter
tainment which is programmed for De
cember 30 at the Alhambra Theater.
The change of entertainment is dua to
the death and sickness among mem
bers, which prompted the idea of a
theatrical benefit. " Numerous volun
teers are-^ rehearsing under the direc
tion of William Freeman and an inter
esting performance is anticipated.

BOSTON, Dec. 22.â Philadelphia Jack
O'Brien won the decision over Twin
Sullivan in a fifteen-round bout at the
Criterion Club to-night. At the ring
side O'Brien weighed 158 pounds, while
Sullivan tipped the scale at 153.
Sullivan was the aggressor from the
first round and O'Brien's fancy leads
were blocked and countered prettily.
O'Brien's tactics were almost entirely
on the defensive upto the ninth round,
when Sullivan's right eye was closed
by a well-directed blow. After, that
O'Brien had little difficulty in reaching
him. In the thirteenth round, however,
O'Brien received a similar injury and
the men were again on equal terms.
In the fifteenth round there was a
warm mixup. '
O'Brien Defeats Twin Sullivan.

P on of the coast. Hi 3 work last night
d id not put any superfluous feathers In
his cap. but at all events the judges
who counted the points decided against
young J Q e Carroll, who did all the work
and put the champion to tlie floor twice
with good straight lefts to the jaw
It started like a battle of friendship
but toward the end the boys warmed
up a bit and commenced to go some
At least Carroll did. All Martin tried
was a sort of a jump, and as soon as
Carroll got jerrr to the style of the
dark-skinned boxer he met him fairly
with an ever ready uppercut. Martin
never landed a solid punch on his
dopy-looking opponent. He fought more
like a tramp than a champ. When the
result of the encounter became known
a volley of hoots and hisses was wafted
up to the roof.
Charley Dunn lost to Harry Healy. a
first-timer, in a four-round go. Healy
had a good punch and the advantage in
weight and Dunn was rather yellow all
the way. Loren Brown won
from Charles Taylor In the
fourth, the bout being stopped
by Referee McDevitt." Pierpont Ordway
bested Jack Adams in four rounds.
HRrry Williams stopped George Robin
son in the third, and Joe McBride fin
ished Kid Cole In a round.
The fights took place in Mechanics*

Henry Spencer viewed the racing
from the ground yesterday. The tall
California rider says that, while he
spent a profitable season on the Aus
trian tracks, he will not return there
next season.
Each of the feather-weights enjoys
this clash of arms and shows it by the
manner in which he sails into his box
ing partner. Hanlon took on Joe
Thomas and Fred Landers yesterday,
each going two rounds of regulation
length. His style of boxing suffers in
comparison with that of Champion
Corbett.
It was a case of fight from start to
finish and a knockout seemed possible
at any time. Hanlon fought as he has>
done each time in the ring â taking sev
eral blows to land one. His favorite
punch was a right uppercut, which he
used repeatedly and to good effect. He
came out of his practice with a cut
nose and a cut mouth.
Hanlon expects to do his last boxing
to-day. This will give the sore spots a
chance to heal thoroughly. He uses one
article In training which is likely to lnl
jure his hands or wrists at any Â¦ mo
ment. This is a padded affair fastened
to the wall of his gymnasium. The
padding has been forced 'out of place
and'the hard wall gets the full strength
of the blow.
v The perspiration was slow to* start
yesterday, but once Hanlon warmed up
It came freely. Harry Foley gave out
his weight as being 133 pounds. His
diet has been unrestricted in variety
and In Quantity.
Young Corbett put In a busy day of
training. He had two plunges in the
ocean, did a long jaunt on the road and
boxed three rounds each with Monte
Attel and George Sanfransen. The lit
tle champion expects to scale J.32',2
pounds to-morrow, when he will weigh
in public for the first time. y.
It is doubtful if any two boxers in
recent years have gene through so se
vere a course of training as Eddie Han-
Ion and Young Corbett have for their
engagement next Tuesday night in Me
chanics' Pavilion. Each day for sev
eral weeks they have engaged in train
ing bouts that have been thinly veiled
fights.
The score was 9 goals to 5, in favof
of the Reds. McCreery made eight and
Driscoll four. Dunphy and Howard
each made one for tneir respective
sides. No faster play has been seen
this season than that which marked
the concluding period. In swift suc
cession Driscoll drove the ball thrice
between the posts, and it began to look
like a tie game. McCreery got into
action again and quickly scored twice.
This terminated the match amid ap
plause for the two great horsemen. The
Fides were:
Redsâ Lawrence McCreery, E. W.
Howard and C. Raoul-Duval.
i Whitesâ T. A. Driscoll. Francis J.
Carolan and Charles Dunphy.
Two periods had been played before
the arrival of Messrs. Carolan and Du
val. The periods were six in number
and were each of ten minutes' dura
tion.
Instead of polo on Christmas day It
-is expected there will be a golf tourna
ment on the club links, with a number
of ladies in the game.
Lawrence McCreery broke the sea
son's record twice on the Burlingame
polo field yesterday. He scored eight
goals during a game, one of them be
ing made from the center of the field in
the remarkably short space of twenty
seconds. The honors of the game lay
almost exclusively between McCreery
and Tom Driscoll.

success in every respect. The weather
was ideal for athletic sports. There
was a large crowd present, and each
victor was accorded a warm reception,
the spectators being liberal with their
applause. No records were broken, al
though the soldiers showed athletic
ability of a high class. With proper

"Not at all," he replied in unadulter
ated English. "I never felt more frisky
in my life. Perhaps that is because I
am so near my homeâ only six days
away, you know." And again he dis
played two rows of perfect teeth.
"You're not homesick?" was queried.
"No, noâ not any more. But I was
homesick for awhile after I left my
own country. Everything is so dif
ferent here, you know." .
Then he bounded away in response to
the summons to dinner." It is said
Schuchouck doffs his smile when he
enters a football game and plays with
a stolid earnestness wonderful to see.
The most interesting member of the
group is Schuchouck, the Kodiak Indian,
who plays center rush, and is said to
be a terror in that position. He is the
only native Alaskan in the group â in
deed the only one who has ever dis
played prowess on the football field â
and his comrades seem to respect him
accordingly.
NATIVE ALASKAN A WONDER.
He is more stalwart than the average
aborigine of the land of the midnight
sun and every penny weight of his 167
pounds is either solid bone or ada
mant muscle. His large "moon" face
lighted up with a cheerful smile when
he was asked if the trip from Utah
had fatigued him.
The young Indians are rigorously
clceroned by their manager and phy
sician. Their perfect physical fitness
at all times is due to their temperate
and regular mode of living. The boy
who transgresses in this respect is at
once sent back to school â and fear of
the disgrace attendant upon such pun
ishment probably has something to do
with their cheerful adherence to the
prescribed regimen.
Only one of the players has been
here l before. Johnson v/as a member
of the Carlisle team tbat came west
in 1S99, since when he has earned the
reputation â indorsed by no less infalli
ble an authority than Walter Camp,
the "father of football"â of being the
greatest quarterback and field general
in all America. He is captain of the
present team and wears his honors so
modestly that nobody would pick him
out for what he is.
INDIANS IN CONDITION.
- Headed by their manager, Mr. War
ner, and their physician, Dr. Waite, the
fifteen young aborigines quietly fell
into line and walked to the Occidental
Hotel, the pedestrian being
considered beneficial to tneir blood cir
culation, as they had been cooped up
in a Pullman ever since they started
from Salt Lake City. They tramped
briskly and with military precision and
arrived at the hotel but a minute or
two behind the bus containing Mrs.
Warner and Mrs. Walte and the bag
gage of the. party. In the hosrclry they
meekly waited while the manager, reg
istered them and then they filed into
the dining-room for dinner. An hour
later they were In their respective
apartments and before 10 o'clock they
were abed.'
After breakfast this morning the lads
will be escorted afoot to Golden Gate
Park, where they will walk until they
are thoroughly limbered up. After
luncheon they, will hie them to Rich
mond field for signal and swift forma
tion practice. This training will be re
peated daily until they meet the Re
liance All-California eleven on Christ
mas afternoon.
There was 'nothing suggestive of the
traditional Indian invasion about the
arrival last evening of the sturdy
young redmen comprising the famous
Carlisle football team. A more docile
appearing or decorously behaved lot of
passengers never stepped off the ferry r
boat. ' Even their cadet uniforms failed
to dispel the impression of placidity
created by their demeanor.
This Afternoon Is to Be De
voted to Signal Practice
and Making Swift Formations
Bell piloted the first and last winners
of the day. Both of his rides were gilt
edged.
Forest King, winner of the, last
event, was boosted $500 over his selling
price of th*e same amount by Sidney
Bender, owner of Lord Melbourne. The
Oregon horse was retained by his
owner, S. J. Jones.
Johnny Hoar, is getting down, to
weight and will be seen in the saddle
shortly. Johnny will ride in Russia
next season in all probability.
The weights for the Christmas handi
cap at one and a quarter miles, with a
gross valuation of more than $4000,
were issued yesterday, and are as fol-
Inms- >
Avenger appears to be a member of
the hard luck division. The Schorr co?t
had Tommy Burns on his back in the
two-year-old number, decided over the
Futurity course, and ruled favorite In
the betting. Slow to get in his striae,
he came from back in the ruck, running
third to Andrew B. Cook and Young
Pepper, beaten a nose and a head. The
winner, Andrew B. Cook, had Chandler
up and was well played at 5 to 1.
There were but five starters in the
seven-furlong purse event, and Hen
shall's sprinter Martinmas seemed the
popular choice. He won, but was not
the best horse. Otis had the mount
and while the other riders were chang
ing their minds or collecting their scat
tered senses Otis picked out the driest
going and in a driving finish downed
Arcade a neck. Dolly Hayman ran a
close third under Lowe, and with a
more experienced rider up could have
won without much difficulty. Nerva
tor died away early under poor rating.
Although Lord Melbourne has been
considered invincible over . a heavy or
muddy track, Sidney Bender's horse
had to doff his hat to Forest King in
the last race. The distance was one
and a sixteenth miles, and the Lord
had such an extended following that
3 to 5 was the first market quotation.
Later the t>rice lengthened to 9 to 10
and evens. The favorite showed the
way into the stretch, but Foresf King
had only been joking, for in a mild
drive Bell landed the second choice first
by a short half length. Lacy Crawford
ran a good third.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
AVENGER IN HARD LUCK.
Fossil, the "bush champion," ridden
by John Bullman, beat the New York
horre Faulconbridge for the $1000 han
dicap ot one mile and seventy yards.
Fossil carried 110 pounds, gave away
weight to every other starter In the
race, made all the running and through
the clever manipulation of, Bullman
when business picked up near the close,
stood a drive and won by half a
length.
Larsen, who rode the Eastern colt,
lodged a claim of .foul with* the judges
against Bullman. The latter rider cer
ta'inly did change his course the last
furlong, carrying Larsen and his mount
Into the deep going on the rail, but
whether enough to retard his progress
Is problematical. Tommy Burns fin
ished third with Divlna. Modicum, the
lightweight of the party, appeared to
poor advantage in the going.
On the strength of a previous grand
performance, Erennus, with Bell in the
saddle, was installed favorite for tho
introductory six and a half furlong
sprint. He rewarded his backers by
winning all by himself. Nullah, at 16
to 1, beat Illlloucn for the place. The
latter received strong support, but was
cut off soon after the start and had to
come from far back.
Both riders were . later removed to
St. Luke's Hospital. The race was
won by Mountebank, the favorite,
piloted by Burns, with Evander second,
less than a length before Oro Viva.
Favorites captured three of the sin
purses. The most surprising upset of
the afternoon was the defeat of Lord
Melbourne In the final number by the
Oregon horse, Forest King.
HANDICAP FOR FOSSIL.
Two jockeys, Linton and Lee Jack

fair is that Captain Henderson did not
display any distress signals and was
endeavoring to beat his way into the
harbor unaided. Although in no im

â¢ The Olivebank was posted on the
overdue list*- last Saturday . and was
quoted at 35 per cent reinsurance.
Despondency, from real or fancied
troubles, caused Mrs. Caroline A. Hsfn
son of 116 Taylor street to end her life
yesterday by the inhalation of illum
inating gas. Beside the lifeless body
were found the remains of her insep
arable companions, three dogs. They
had also been killed by the monoxide.
A. Brown, who conducts a store at
118 Taylor street, noticed during the
day that the customary barking of the
dogs was not heard and determined to
investigate. - Securing a ladder Brown
placed it against a rear window, and
upon looking into the sleeping apart
ment of the dead woman saw her in
animate form lying on the bed. Patrol
men Hutchlngs and O'Brien were sum
moned and forced an entrance.
' The house was filled with gas from
two open burners in the chamber of
death. They were immediately turned
off and the Coroner's oflice notified. ' An
investigation by Deputy Meehan
brought to light several almost unin
telligible letters written in a mixture
of Swedish and English. From the tenor
of those that could be deciphered it ap
pears that the unfortunate woman was
despondent. The crevices of doors and
windows opening into the bedroom had
been stuffed with towels so aa to make
the room practically airtight.
. 'About one week ago two of the rooms
were partially destroyed by fire result
ing from | the overturning of > a coal oil
damp and it was with difficulty that
Mrs. Hanson was parried to a place of
safety by a policeman. To friends she
stated that -the ' insurance companies
had paid her $500, but a bankbook of
thjjr Hlbernia Bank, found in the room,
showed only a deposit of $10. Detectives
detailed on the case made an investiga
tion and are satisfied that she com
mitted suicide.

will be a total loss.
ANTWERP, Dec. 22.â Another large
steamer has gone ashore near where
the Red Star liner Finland grounded

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 22.â The
troubles of a band of gypsies, which
has been camped in the west bottoms,
is one of the most peculiar and compli
cated that has been brought to the at
tention of the police for several years.
The band came during the latter part
of November. Repeated requests have
been made by the police of San Fran
cisco, on complaint of the head' of an
other branch of a' tribe there, for the
arrest of Louis Mitchell, the chief of
this branch. Warrants were issued in
a California court for the arrest - of
Mitchell, and were received here* to
day. Mitchell was arrested and taken
before Justice Hicks, but released un
der a $500 bond.
The charge against Mitchell is that
he stole $4000 from John Joe, the head
of a clan of gypsies now in San Fran
cisco. Until last summer, according {o
Mitchell, the two tribes of gypsies lived
peaceably together in San Francisco.
Louis Mitchell, whose gypsy name is
Groffo Zerka, was the head of one tribe
and John Joe the head of another. All
of the members of the tribesS are
wealthy. It is said that Zerka has
$15,000 in gold in his possession. Joe
claims that last summer Zerka entered
his tent and stole $3000 in American
gold coins and $1000 in French and
Spanish coins.
The clan of which Zerka is chief then
came to Kansas City. John Joe's
branch remained in San Francisco.
Zerka had been here but a few days
when he learned that he had been fol
lowed by John Doe and his two broth
ers, Nicholine and George.- The* three
brothers did not go into the Zerka camp
for some time, but apparently prowled
about, watching Zerka and his people
from a- distance. Finally the three
brothers ventured into the camp in
Kansas City and made friends with
the members. After they had been there
several days they took $450 from Zerka
by stealth and were arrested the fol
lowing day. When taken before Judge
Hicks the three Joe brothers admitted
the theft and offered to refund the
money. This was dene, and Zerka re
fused to prosecute. Zerka then feared
he was in danger of bodily harm at
the hands of the Joe brothers and ask
ed protection from the police. The^Joe
brothers went- to Denver soon after
and there made attempts to get war
rants to have Zerka arrested. ' t From
there they went back to San Francisco
and succeeded in getting out warrants
for Zerka.

OCEAN VESSELS
MEET DISASTER
The bark, which sailed from Shang
hai'on October 26 in ballast for Royal
Roads, B. C. ran into a succession of
terrific gales after being out one month
and for the last thirty days has been
drifting helplessly at the mercy of the
sea, with only a few jury sails to keep
her nose to the wind.
Word was received in this city from
the Weather Bureau lookout at the
Farallones yesterday morning/that a
four-masted bark was in distress off
the islands. Vlie Spreckels tug Defi
ance was immediately dispatched for
the scene and is still standing by to
render whatever assistance may, be
necessary. The lookout was unable
to decipher" the vessel's name and
there was much speculation among
shipping folks, as to Â» the identity, of
the craft. S\ ! .
Word was received last evening that
the weather-beaten vessel is the Brit
ish park Olivebank, bound from
Shanghai to Royal Roads. Captain
Henderson is the master of the ship
and is known as a skillful navigator.
Nothing but three unsightly stumps,
rising several feet above the deck, ire
left of three of the masts. The jigger
is still Intact. Three jibs, have been
rigged up forward and a small sail on
the stump of the forward mast. This
canvas, with that on the remaining
mast, is all that ha.3 saved her from
going to the bottom.
The hull is in good condition, with
the exception of a portion of the star
board side, amidsb'ps, where one of
the yards fell out and cut an ugly
hole. The crew of nineteen, In addi
tion to the five officers, are safe, and
no one was hurt during the terrible
battle with the elements. The men
say that a succession of heavy gales
were encountered, and owing to the
lightness and crankiness of the vessel
it became necessary to cut aw&y some
of the rigging.* 'Their lives were con
tinually in danger from falling yards,
and on several occasions it looked as
if the vessel would go to the bottom.
The Olivebank is a four-masted
steel bark and is owned, by Andrew
Wier of Glasgow. She was built in
1S92 by Mackie & Thomson at Port
Glasgow.' Her net tonnage is 2200
and her dimensions are: Length, 326
feet: beam, 43Â«1; and depth, 24.5 feet.
She cost $90,000.
The Olivebank is a sister ship to the
Gifford that was lost on the night of
September 26 last on Mussel. Rock, five
miles below/the Gliff House. The Gif
ford was laden with coal en route from
Australia to this port. Ill luck seems
to have pursued , the owners of these
vessels. 'Ten years ago the ship Gos
ford, N owned by the same company,
went ashore below Point Conception.
As darkness closed in on the vessel
last night the Defiance was still lying
alongside and a price will undoubtedly
be agreed upon to tow the disabled
craft into port. A pilot from the pilot
boat America is i aboard the ; Olivebank
and in, the event that Captain Hender
son refuses a tow it is thought the ves
sel may make port to-day with a good
breeze. . .
V The captain and officers refuse to
talk and the only information that can
be gleaned comes from ; the crew. .The
ship presents " a 1 battered " appearance,
but Â¦ it appears that \ the upper .. works
have" not i been . badly, damaged. ', ! -
A peculiar feature of the entire "af-
With three masts gone and depend
entupon jury sails and the canvas on
her one remaining stick to keep her
from drifting to destruction, the Brit
ish bark Olivebank was twelve miles
northeast of the Farallon Islands late
last night, endeavoring to beat her way
into this harbor without the assistance
of the tug Defiance, which ran to her
assistance.
Fully .is striking as either of the two
views mentioned, as illustrative" of the
gayety of San Francisco, was a mov
ing oicture of Golden Gate Park on
Sunday at a point where the Sunday
GRAND ARSIY PASSES.
Another striking scene that has keen
local Interest and is calculated to at
tract the attention of the millions from
all carts of the world who will visit
St. Louis was the march of the Grand
Army of the Republic tip Market street
during the Grand Encampment week In
1JK>3, Quite a large array of the veter
ans was visible at one time and the
film continued until the presentation
, was made realistic.
One of the pictures projected on the
ecreen yesterday depicted the review
on Van Ness avenue of the San Fran
cisco school children. It was clean cut.
Twenty thousand c'ildren at least were
seen to wave their American fia^s. The
progress of President Roosevelt up and
down the opposing ranks of patriotic
youngsters, as they ttood in array on
the sidewalks, was a fine counterfeit
vision of the real happening as it was
actually viewed by a half million peo
ple. As the day of that parade was
favorable for the outpouring of the en
tire population to Van Ness avenue, so
it was also excellent for the biograph.
Yesterday the management of the
Â¦Orpheum gave the free use of the au
ditorium to enable the committee to
use the stage screen. To-day the com
mittee will meet and may decide upon
certain views to be provided. To se
cure the views of the Christmas mar
kets of the city prompt action will be
necessary.
- A general view of the Presidio and a
rZre-fs parade at that place will be de
sirable illustrations of ilfr In this city.
It is possible that a disappearing gun
in .-union, used as a harbor defense,
might be shown.
The general idea of the committee
is to show only characteristic views
that point out the peculiarities of cli
mate, location and industries that be
long to San Francisco as contrasted
with other large cities in the United
States. The exhibition by that plan
will be new to people who have not
seen this city and as engrossing as
foreign travel.
The committee also desires to have
noving pictures of the school children
of San Francisco to the number of at
least 40,000. To secure such a picture
it would take a long time in event the
children march. The passing of 40.000
persons in procession requires hours.
The committee will talk about this. It
may be possible to get the pictures of
the 40.000 school children by employing
the automobile to pass by them on a
â¢month pavement, like that of Van
Ness avenue. It might be as feasible
to do this as to employ the same means
to gÂ»t a comprehensive panorama of
Golden Gate Park.
POLICE AND FIREMEN". .
Then the committee may desire to
have a moving picture of the San
Francisco Fire and Police departments.
The coming and going of a Chir.a
steamship, the passing of a Govern
ment transport, the movement of the
shipping alonjr the water front of San
Francisco as viewed from the deck of
a tug, the fruit boats from up the riv
ers, the movements of the ferry-boats,
the fruit markets of the city at Christ
mas time, showing strawberries and
other fruits in the open air displayed
f( r sale, with fresh vegetables, etc. â
these are among the scenes that may
be Fhown at St. Louis.
Mr. Mills raid last evening that the
committee had seen that it was possi
ble, after viewing the biograph pictures
yesterday, to secure what is needed
without sending to Europe. The views
oa th<* screen were taken by Americans
whose services can be secured in this
city. In Mr. Mills' view it would b*
well to have moving pictures of Golden
Gate Park, starting at. Baker street
and going out to the ocean, taking In
all features on the way. The character
of the vegetation being largely semi
tropical this would point out to intel
ligent observers from all parts of tho
world what the climate of San Fran
cisco is. Such a picture might be ob
tained by using an automobile to carry
the camera.
Lerge plans are entertained by the
executive committee charged with the
duty of seeing that San Francisco is
adequately pictured for exhibition in the
California State building at the St.
Louis Exposition next year. The com
mittee assembled yesterday in the Or
rheum on invitation of W. H. Mills to
pee on a screen what pictures the
Southern Pacific Company has as a
possible nucleus for a collection that
hhall exemplify San Francisco. The
excellence of some of the views brought
out. applause.^ The general effect was
to increase the enthusiasm in behalf of
piving San Francisco a chance to put
its best foot forward. at St. Louis.
Mrs. Anthony told her story without
any attempt to be dramatic or sen
sational. Her voice was seldom raised
above a whisper, as if she keenly felt
the disgrace. At times the statements
of the witness were so remarkable that
the soectators marveled that she could
have gone through all she had and
lived. Her condition is very bad and
during the present trial she has faint
ed a number of times. Judge Hebbard
was exceedingly kind ; sterday and
whenever the witness sfiowed signs of
fatigue he called a halt.
"When we were living^it *4 Wefcster
street," testified Mrs. Anthony, '"the
doctor kept his eye on mo. If I at
teniDted to go out he would stop me.
My clothes were hidden, my hat was
hidden and even "the door was locked.
If I tried to leave the house he w^uld
force me into a room and throw me
down on a cot. .He slept in his sister's
house and watched me all day."
Attorney Grant Carpenter then asked
Mrs. Anthony to tell the circumstances
that led to her attempt to commit sui
cide. ;
"It was all due to my. attempt to see
you, Mr. Carpenter," replied the wit
ness. "He would not let me call on
you and then he compelled* me to visit
the newspapers to have them stop pub-
From the evidence adduced yester
day, it was shown that even after the
doctor had obtained the decree of di
vorce he lived with his wife and cor
responded with her. He had promised
Jjer that at -the end of six months, if
she was a good woman and had chas
tened her soul, he would remarry her.
Instead of keeping his promise, the doc
tor and a woman who had nursed the
first wife journeyed to Yuma, Ariz.,
and were married.
The sufferings the wife alleges she
underwent affected her health. She ac
cuses the doctor of having obtained the
separation from her while she was in
a sanitarium and incapable of making
a defense. She charges that her hus
band had compelled her to write let
ters to various people admitting that
she had been guilty of misconduct as
a wife. She stated that the affidavit
introduced by her husband's counsel,
in which she asks the court to grant
her husband a divorce and making cer
tain admissions,* was 8 worn to under
duress, menace and trickery. She testi
fied yesterday that at her husband's
instigation she went to various news
paper offices to stop the publication of
articles that were detrimental to him
and upon reporting her failure to sup
press the publication of stories of the
divorce he upbraided her and told
their children that their mother was a
bad woman, and while suffering from
this further humiliation she took poi
son with suicidal intent and was saved
from death by her husband and an
other physician.
STORY" OF SUFFERING.
FAILED TO KEEP PROMISE.
Mrs. Christina Anthony occupied the
witness* stand in Judge Hebbard's
courtroom all day yesterday and con
tinued her story of the torture she al
leges she experienced at the hands of
her husband, Dr. Richard S.^Anthony.
The tale of her sufferings has been pub
lished at various times,, yet those who
listened to the story told by the wom
an .under oath, forced to believe her
â¢and believing, sympathize with her.
The story, she told on the witness
sta,nd yesterday and. last week. is the
strangest ever heard .in a
She is a native ofSouth Africa and
ccmes of one of the- leading Boer fami
lies of that distant country- While liv
ing there she met Anthony, who was
engaged in missionary work. It was
a love match and she began to use her
influence to raise him to a higher sphere
in life. "With her money she gave him
a better education and brought him to
Michigan In order that he might pre
pare for the study of medicine. Subse
quently the couple came to this city and
Anthony entered the Cooper Medical
College, from which he graduated. They
returned to South Africa and through
her influence the husband was given
charge of a big sanitarium owned by
her relatives. Subsequently the Boer
war broke out and Dr. Anthony was ar
rested by the British Government .on a
charge of treason, and through the no
ble efforts of the woman who now* sues
to have the decree of divorce he ob
tained annulled he was saved from
being executed. The wife preceded her
husband to . this- country and was fol
lowed by him. He, immediately upon
his arrival, accused her of infidelity and
tried to deprive her of her two chil
dren. â¢ â¢ Â»

The witness testified that the doctor
was broken-hearted because she an
swered his letters and closed with
"yours truly," whereas he wanted her
â¢ to use a more affectionate term. Shs
was subjected to a very close jcross
examination by Attorney Savage, who
introduced letters to prove that she had
signed an affidavit at her own free will.
She said she did so because she feared
the doctor would have her committed
to an asylum, as he always claimed
she was insane.
The case will go on this morning.
The records show that Judge Heb

the ground of desertion on Ju!y 16. 1903.

to his daughter Estelle subsequently:

The closing exercises of the Irving
M. Scott Grammar School were held
yesterday. .The programme, in charge
of Principal Miss M. M. Murphy, was
as follows:
The actual cutting down of great
trees for' lumber was witnessed by the
audience. There were exclamations as
the towering trunks* fell to the ground
and sent up clouds of dust. Then there
were -seen traction. . engines drawing
trains of logs to the mill through the
clearings in the forest and down moun
tain grades and trains of cars drawn
by locomotives piled up with logs o*
sawed lumber. The successive steps in
lumbering were pictured, from the cut
ing of the trees to starting the pro
duct to market by rail. The lumbering
pictures that were exhibited will be
shown in connection with the forestry
exhibit of California at St. Louis.
Something more than an hour was
passed by the committee inspecting the
moving pictures and also in seeing
some stationary views on the screen.
GRAMMAR SCHOOti CLOSES.
parade of fine equipages was seen in
large proportions, with the Key monu
ment in the background. As a winter
scene this will appeal to the fancy of
the peoDle of the East.
The daily moving spectacle near the
corner of Third and Market streets was
thrown on the screen. Cable cars came
and went. The motley procession of
vehicles of every description that is a
familiar sight during all daylight hours
on secular days passed along: with the
men and women and children of the
city, getting through the breaks be
tween the carts and wagons and cross
ing Market street as best they could.
A traveler could not see Market street
any better by standing on the spot in-"
dicated. â¢
There were views of the flight of the
Sunset Limited for the committee to
see; of staging upon the mountain
grades in California: of fruit picking;
of the hop . fields at Pleasanton dur
ing the gathering: of the crop; of har
vesting on California ranches with
great machines drawn either by trac

of hydraulic mining in Placer County,
etc. These had- no necessary relation
to San Francisco. AH the 'views were

could be used, the understanding be

would do what it could to aid the com

waysâ when the log was going and also
when it was coming toward the spec
tators. Heretofore the darkness in mills
has made it impossible to make satis
factory interior pictures for the bio
graph. Even in mills where there were
no sides and only the overhang
ing roofing to interfere with the
light the biograph has failed. Some
time aero Mr. Mills learned that a mill
in course of construction, owned by
J. R. Potter and located at Pokegama.
in Oregon, just across the California
State line, was sawing lumber in the
open; in fact, it was providing the
building lumber to cover itself. Mr.
Mills secured there the effective use of
the biograph. Several leading lumber
men of California were present with the
San Francisco committee in the Or
pheum yesterday. They admired this
unique view.

A VOYAGE FROM SHANGHAI. WHICH PORT SHE LEFT ON OCTOBER 26. ;
Joe was robbed of $3000 while his
brand was encamped on the San Bruno
road in this city last August.. A great
deal of mystery surrounded the case,
but the thieves were never brought to
justice. At the time the robbery hap
pened Joe. accused two young men of
the neighborhood of having stolen the
money out of a tent. They were ar
rested, but as no evidence could be col
lected^, their dismissal soon followed.
Many of the gypsies insinuated, at the
time, that some person or percons con
nected with the band stole the money,
but no more arrests followed, as. the
gypsies left this city - soon after.
In a suit involving: the' validity of
the tax levy for high school purposes
made by the Board of Trustees of
Visalia, the Supreme Court declared
yesterday that separate levies for com
mon schools and for high schools
must be made in municipalities where
the population is greater than .1000.
This is In accordance with the pro
visions of the Polftical Code.
S. C. Brown, who brought the suit,
claimed the law was special legislation
and therefore unconstitutional. The
Supreme Court says that the law is
general in its operation and is special
only in making a classification of
schools.*
The court also decided yesterday
that a fende.is a building. P. M.
Swasey brought, suit against the
Supervisors of Shasta', County for
awarding a contract for the construc
tion "of a fence -around the .court
house because the board had not given
the job 'to the lowest bidder. : The
Supervisors maintained that the! law
applied only to buildings and the Su
preme Court agrees but says; that a
fence is a building. .- . ; '

TO SAIL.
Rudolph Baldes is a deep sea sailor,
who has plowed the waves â¢ for many
years. Recently he shipped from Ham
burg and in Callao tore a South Ameri 7
can inhabitant from stem to stern with
a pair of barbed brass knuckles. One
of the barbs was broken in the encoun
ter. When he landed in San "Francisco
he still had the ''knuckles." He. came
ashore from his. ship, intent on repeat
ing his South American experience. A
policeman on Pine street expeditiously
put him -out of business. The brass
knuckles were found on him when he
was arrested and were booked as evi
dence. When Judge . Cabaniss passed
on the matter he readily found Baldes
guilty of carrying concealed weapons
and sentenced him to twenty days in
the County Jail. When the stout ship
comes from Seattle perhaps Baldes will
be ready to go before the mast,' minus
his formidable armor.

On hatchway No. 2 of the transport
Sherman, which arrived here from Ma
nila a few days ago, there happened, a
spirited prize fight between James
Green, a soldier, and Dave Ta-fe, one of
the messboys of the ship. After six
rounds of sensational going the mess
boy put tha warrior to %the mat for
the count. While the little mill was in
progress Frank Peterson, a bellboy,
was slashed in the side by one. of the
soldiers and the stabbing created a
sensation.
This is the first time oh record that
one of' Uncle Sam's transports has been
used for the purpose of the display of
the? manly art. The fight was arranged
on the quiet without the consent of the
officers and an admission fee of $lwas
charged. The winner of the bout ivas
awarded a purse of $75.
The fight was a hot one while it,last
ed and many bets were laid by the in
terested spectators. When the mill waa
at its most interesting period Bellboy
Frank Peterson tried to break in. A
sentry was on guard and had orders to
admit no one who did not pay. The
sentry slashed Peterson in the side
with his bayonet when he tried to
force his Â¦ way in.
The boy received a painful wound
and was confined in the ship's hospital
for the balance of the trip. Orders
have been issued to the effect that no
more scraps shall take place on board
a transport.

Michael Shea belongs to a hard fam

ting into trouble until yesterday, when
he appeared,before Judge Cabaniss on
a charge of threats to kill. His wife
was the complaining witness. She said
that the defendant. had informed the
neighborhood and herself that he was
going to extinguish his line of the Shea
family, including a 10-year-old girl.
Shea denied this strenuously, and said
that all he wished was to be rid of
the woman. The Judge allowed him
to go under promise that he would not
bother his wife in any way.

, The death sentence was passed upon
Henry Milton, alias George H. Lup
ton, by Judge Lawlor yesterday for the
murder of James Gilleece, the aged
saloon-keeper, on Eleventh street, near
Market, shortly after midnight on
April 15: The date of the execution
was fixed for March 11 at San Quentin.
Milton's face remained impassive while
the Judge pronounced judgment upon
him.
When the case was called Judge
Lawlor asked Milton if he had any
thing to say why the sentence of the
court should not be pronounced upon
him. Attorney Henry C. Dibble, who
was appointed by the court to repre
sent the defendant, made a motion for
a new â¢ trial on statutory grounds',
which was denied. Dibble then made
a motion for arrest of judgment, which
was also denied. After sentence had
been pronounced Dibble asked for a
stay of ten days, as the defendant de
sired to see some friends before being
sent to San Quentin and he also in
tended to take an appeal to the Su
preme Court. The stay was granted;
Milton is looked upbn by the police
as the most dangerous criminal in the
State. He was sentenced to a term for
burglary on September 2, 1878, and
for assault to murder on June 30, 1880.
While serving the latter term in Fol
som penitentiary he made his escape
and served two terms in Eastern peni
tentiaries before being brought back to
complete his time in Folsom.
The crime for which he will | be
hanged was a cowardly one. Gilleece
had locked up his, saloon on Ninth
street and was on his way home when
Milton came' out of an alley and or
dered him to throw up his hands.
Gilleece though^ it was one , of his
friends playing a joke on him. but was
quickly undeceived when Milton struck
him on the head with a steel bar sev
eral times. Gilleece grappled with him
and shouted for help.
During the struggle M'ilton pulled a
revolver out of his pocket and fired a
shot at Gilleece. who died from the ef
fects of the wound ,on May 25. \ When
Milton's pockets were searched after
being arrested skeleton keys, a
"Jimmy" and a bottle of "knock-out
drops" were found.

Assistant United Stales District At
torney Banning 'says that he will try
Rumble on* one of the counts of the
indictment, as suggested by the court,
and will prepare two additional in
dictments against Rumble, which he
thinks will give the defendant and his
attorneys a sufficiency of legal exer
cise for several weeks to come.
United States District Judge de
Haven yesterday quashed the indict
ment against G. W. Rumble charging
him with having used the mails for
the purpose of defrauding his corre
spondents by means of a mining
Bcheme. In rendering his decision
Judge de Haven said:
"The. Indictment in this case
charged three distinct offenses against
section 5480 of the Revised Statutes,
and, as I construe the indictment, no
two of these -were committed within
the same six calendar months. The
section upon which the Indictment is
based provides:
"'The indictment. Information, or
complaint may severally charge of
fenses to the number of three when
committed within the same six calen
dar months.'
"I am unable to escape the con
clusion that this section furnishes the
exclusive rule in relation to the joinder
of offenses against â¢ this particular
statute. In other words, It Is. only
separate offenses committed within
the same six calendar months -which
may be joined in the same indictment.
This being so, the motion of the de
fendant to quash will be granted, un
less the Government elects to proceed
upon one count of the indictment."

.It is a mortal . offense to feed the
hamadryas on chocolate candy out at
the, Chutes. The hamadryas appears to
the onlooker to be an ordinary monkey
with a bad temper,, but scientific ex
perts testified in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday that he was captured with
great pains in the warm belt that sep
arates Afghanistan from the rest of the
known world. To feed such an animal
chocolate^ meant deathâ in large, black
letters.
Harold Montgomery, fresh from Oak
land, attempted the task last Thurs
day. A keeper of monkeys named
James Mooney found Harold dropping
chocolate candy in the hamadryas'
mouth. He pushed him into the Zoo,
which adjoins the habitation of the
"friends of men" at the Chutes, and
beat him on the head with a leather
covered "billy." Montgomery lay un
conscious for three, days as a result of
the assault.
The case .was tried partly, but the de
fendant asked for- a continuance until
next Friday morning, when he expects
to prove that he was merely trying to
save . Montgomery from the aavage
beast.

Quotations:
Eastern Wool Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 22. â To-day's stock mar
ket was only nominal, and the greater part of
the day was spent in Idleness by the brokers.
Many members lost hope .of any business and
betook themselves to cut-of-town points In an
ticipation of holiday enjoyment.' '.The most vig
orous efforts which the handful of floor traders
could muster had no success in listing prices,
and there was no urgent pressure to seli, with
the consequences that prices were inert. A
desultory speculation was kept up in the stocks
of the New York public utilities, but their ad
vances were but feebly held. Operations in
these etocks have been pretty constant ever
since the New York election. Talk of large
earnings accompanied the dealings, and in the
case of Consolidated Gas there are suggestions
of a satisfactory adjustment of claims against
the city for gas. There was some pressure
against Rock Island and affiliated securities of
a kind which developed last week when rumors
found arefptance cf a pending bond issue. On
the ether hand, some 01 the industrials are in
clmed to harden on thelassumption that money
will be available after New Year's to the rail
roads to pursue their equipment purchases
The heaviness of the London raw copper mar
ket may have caused the slight decline in
Amalgamated Copper after an early advance
in that stock. United States Steel preferred
was the subject o* the customary surmises as
to dividend possibilfUes, but fell Into profound
neglect with the rest of the market. Lacka
wanna reacted from its recent wide advance
which was due to talk of a distribution of sur
plus. The coalers generally were flrm on con
templation of results of a year of unexcropled
prosperity as a whole rather than on the Im
mediate outlook, which is somewhat clouded
The uncertainties of the Far Eastern war out
look are a repressive Influence on all the
world's markets, but local sentiment on the
subject reflects no acute apprehensions. There
has been eome unostentaxious bidding up of
stocks of a dormant class within the lsat few
days, which is obviously due to the fact that
no utock is brought out by the advanced bids
made. â¢
It does not escape notice that the higher
level of prices will cause a material Improve
ment in the showing of annual balance sheets
of many of the great financial Institutions
whose surplus accounts investm.nts were deep!

fchown is supposed to supply the motive for

Chicago had quite a decline yesterday. Wires
to Bolton, de Ruyter &.Co. said: "The market
Is lower. Local receipts cf hog.* were a little
less than expected, and prices at the yards 5c
higher, but the market has had a sharp ad
vance of late and packers were rather free sell
ers, hoping probably to shake out sonte scat

The distributive demand Is good and we see
nothing to change the views we have held for
some time past, that provisions are worth the
meney and will ultimately sell higher."

The few Cranberries left on hand are meeting
with a brisk inquiry at steady quotations. A

barrels in all,- were received from Portland,
Or- and were offering at $14@15 per barrel.
All lines of fresh fruits showed a little more
activity than* on the preceding day.' Local
dealers were purchasing rather freely for the
holiday trade and there was some little inquiry
for shipment to nearby markets. The Orange
market is In fair shape, considering the heavy
supplies on hand, and as receipts are decreas
ing and there will be no more auctions this
week the market has a chance to clÂ»*n up.
Another sale of highly colored Navels from
Butte County was reported for shipment to
Los Angeles, which makes It apparent that the
fruit in that section has not yet fully ripened,
owing to the drouth and cold weather there.
Cheap and medium grades of Apples were In
clined to easiness, while fancy stock was in
good demand and firm. Stocks of Quinces and
Persimmons were light and prices were un
changed. Winter Nellis Pears were offering
in limited quantities and were in fair request
at the previously quoted rates. The market
is heavily supplied with Bananas, but prices
are no lower, owing to the high prices at ship
ping points.

rMTPAGO Dec 22. â Interest lagged In the
whe"t pit and trading assumed a holiday dull
ness The news of the day was bearish. Re
ceipt's in the Southwest were much larger,
the weather in Argentina was better and har
vesting is progressing favorably while EngUih
markets were, lower. Receipts In the North
west were also large, being about one hundred
cars more than a year ago. With all these
factors to depress it. the market, however, held
up remarkably well and prices showed \ery
small recessions. \ â¢
The opening was steady, with May unchanged
to %c, higher at 82%c to 83c. Shorts were still
somewhat concerned in regard to the situation
in the Far East and bought quite freely at the
start Offerings were rather limited and dur
ing the first hour May ranged within a quarter
cent. Extremely heavy receipts in the South
west Induced considerable selling by pit traders
later in the session and the market became
easier. May going down to 82%c. Active cov
ering by shcrts however, checked tne decline
and caused a eKgnt rally. A steady tone pre
vailed at the close and final figure* on May
were at S2%c, with a loss of %c for the day.
Buying on small- declines by a prominent
commission house was the only important fea
ture in trading in corn. Local traders were
bullish anfl offerings from this source were ex
ceedingly light. The country movement con
tinued light in spite of fine weather, there be
ing no offerings from anywhere except Illinois,
and they -were very moderate. There- was a
little selling for outside account, but prices
showed only small changes. The close was
steady, with May unchanged at 43%c, after
opening unchanged to %c lower at 43%c to
43%c and selling between 43%c and 43%c.
Oats shared in the general dullness and an
easier tone prevailed, although there was llttlo
change in. prices. .Locals traders were not in
clined to sell, owing to* the impression that the
principal long interest had added to its hold
ings and what little offerings there were on
the market came largely from scalpers. After

Egsjs are very weak. . Buyers are going ajxrut
the street looking for bargains, and are getting
them. Close buyers will no longer pay over
3S%c, and anything over this figure represent
small sales of extra fine stock to buyers who do
not take the trouble to purchase closely. A
good many ranch are changing hands at S5c.
Receipts are about the same for a week or so
past, but the demand is slow.
Receipts were 42.CCO lbs Butter, 690 cases
Eggs and 4000 lbs Cheese.
Butter seems to be trembling on the verge of
another decline, as close buyers are not paying
over 25c now and say they are getting all they
want at this figure. Dealers report the demand
very dull, though stocks are not as heavy as
they were a week ago.
Cheese shows continued weakness, stocks bn-
Ing altogether too heavy for Che capacity of the
market.

Young Woman Hart In a Collision.
BERKELEY. Dec. 22. â In a colli
sion between her buggy and a grocery
wagon, driven by Harvey Levy, at Uni
versity and Shattuck avenues. Miss
Doris Weston of 1700 University ave
nue was thrown out and severely
bruised this afternoon. The drivers at
tempted to turn out of each other's
way, but became bewildered and ran
into each other. Mis3 Weston was
driven home by J. M. McLeod and is
now under the care of a physician.
P. E. Newton, the complaining wit
ness, ventured to suggest that the trial
be set before M. C. Woodruffs bat
tery case against Fisher Is tried, when
the saloon man exclaimed. "What have
you got to do with it? That is not
your case." . This angered Justice Ed
gar, who read Fisher a lesson on court
room propriety and ordered the pug
nacious saloon man to sit down, which
he promptly did.
The trial for disturbing the peace
was finally set for January 19- ThÂ«
battery case will be tried on January
14. the time originally set. Fisher
wanted an immediate trial, but Justice
Edgar refused to heed his request.
BERKELEY, Dec. 22. â Justice Ed
gar administered a stinging rebuke
this morning to Sam Fisher, the West
Berkeley saloon man. charged with as
saulting men and women who were
connected with the Trinity Ladies' Aid
Society "rummage sale." Fisher was
awaiting the setting of his case for re
trial for disturbing the peace.

A deputation of police sergeants will

A well-defined rumor is in circulation
in the department that outside influ
ence has be^n brought to bear upon the
Commissioners to postpone the exam
ination for six months so that the re
cently appointed twelve sergeants
might be in a p<feition to take part in
it. The old sergeants consider thU as
unfair to them and will therefore urge
the necessity of a speedy examination.
It is the rule that no officer can take
part in an examination until he haa
served six mor.thÂ» in the- office to
which he has been promoted and the
old sergeants see no good reason why
this rule should be set aside by defer-

The two women were admitted to ball
in the sum of $10,000 each. James Gil-

RISING SUN, Ind.. Dec. 22.â In its
report of the investigation into the as
sassination of Mrs. Elizabeth Gillespie
on December 3 the Grand Jury this
afternoon returned bills of murder In
the first 'degree against. James Gillespie,
a twin brother of the murdered woman;
Mrs. Belle Seward, her widowed sister;
Mrs. Carrie Barbour, niece of Dr. Thad
deus A. Reamy, an eminent physician
of Cincinnati, and Myron Barbour. her
husband. Mrs. Barbour is a sister-in
law of Dr. Gillespie, a brother of the
murdered woman.
Bench warrants were issued imme
diately. The Glllespies were expecting
arrest and Dr. Gillespie drove to the
home of the accused in a closed car
riage and brought the Thdicted persons
to the courthouse, surrendering all of
them to the court. A newspaper pho
tographer attempted to take a snap
shot of the party and was struck by
James Gillespie, who broke away from
Sheriff Rump and knocked the camera
from the hands of the newspaper man.
The four indictments were read to
the accused, who showed no emotion.
The indictments charged them with
having "feloniously, maliciously and
with premeditated intent" caused the
death of Elizabeth Gillespie. A con
spiracy against the woman to kill her
is charged. James Gillespie. her twin
brother, is the one who is charged as
the principal," although all are accused
of murder in the first degree.

United States District Attorney Mar
shall B. Woodworth received yester
day the full text of an opinion re
cently handed down by United States
District Jud,ge Roy of the northern
district of New York, which coincides
with the opinion ' formerry handed
down by United States District Judge
Wheeler of Vermont to the effect that
in. cases where a Chinese person ap
plies for admission to the United
States on the representation that he
is a native thereof and after a hear
ing by the Chinese Bureau is denied
a landing, he is debarred from ap
pealing to the Federal courts on hab
eas corpus, and may appeal only to
the Secretary of the Department of
Commerce and Â«Labor. Â»Â¦
The learned. Judges, In their opin
ions, say that the action of the immi
gration authorities and of the Secre
tary of the Department of Commerce
and Labor in. such cases is final and
cannot be reviewed by the Federal
courts. -
Mr. Woodworth has instructed As
sistant United States District* Attor
neys Benjamin L. McKinley and Dun
can E.McKinlay to file demurrers in
all the habeas corpus cases of Chinese
now pending in -the United States
District Court, basing the demurrers
upon the opinions referred to. Should
Judge de Haven sustain the demur
rers, a vast quantity, of business will
be taken away, from r United States
Court Commissioner Heacock_and the
District Attorney's office, and Ihe flood
of alleged native born citizens of
Chinese origin will be effectually
dammed all over the United States.

Attorney M. H. .Helneman, who rep
resents Martin Regensberger. named in
the will as executor, testified that he
drew the will In 18S8 for Mrs. LoringJ
He said, however, that he had. not
sufficient knowledge of her handwriting
to ' enable him to state whether the
cancellation was written by- the de
ceased. â¢ â¢
J. O'Leary testified that he first met
Mrs. Loring fifteen years ago when he
was a boy of twelve. He said he saw
a great deal of her and that in his
opinion her mind was not sound in
1895, the time the will was canceled. -
J. M. Newbert, an employe: of the
Public'Admlnistrator, was the first
witness examined yesterday.' - He tes-l
tified to having gone â¢ to the home of
the eccentric, woman a short time after

He said he found the will of Mrs. Lor

The document ' purporting to be the
will of Mrs. Emma K. Loring, the
eccentric woman who was found dead
in her home at 2409 Sacramento street
last June, was the subject of discus

WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.â The apos
tolic delegation has received word from
Rome that the Pope has granted dis
pensation from abstinence on . New
Year's day, which falls on Friday this
year. The delegation has sent out cir
cular letters to all the Bishops, notify
ing them of this fact.
New Year's Not a Fast Day.
. Later Kelly, accompanied by . his
mother and wife, callea at trie Hall of
Justice and swore to a complaint be
fore Police Judge Mogan charging
Monaghan with an assault to commit
murder. The warrant was served upon
Mo--Â»ghan at the hospital. . â¢
'Mrs. Nellie Kelly placed the whole
blame upon her daughter-in-law. "My
son," she said, "has been married just
one year, and during that time his wife
has left him three times and has gone
with .this man Monaghan. My son is
infatuated' with her and has always
taken her back. He is as good a boy
as ever breathed the breath of life and
I cannot understand what his wife
means by leaving Tiim. She claims that
Monaghan is a far away relation of
her mother, but- 1 don't believe her. I
suppose Monaghan got mad because
she concluded to return to her husband
again and leave him. I' have not yet
gdt over the fright he gave me when
he tried to shoot me."
SWEARS OUT WARRANT.
Monaghan . walked across the street
and after gazing "up at the windows
of the Kelly residence he opened his
vest and- fired two shots at his heart.
He fell to the sidewalk. The police
were notified and Monaghan was aent
to the Central Emergency Hospital; It
was found that both .bullets had en
tered Monaghan's left chest, but missed
the. vital organs.
About D o'clock yesterday morning
Monaghan again called at. the. Kelly
home. Mrs. Nellie' Kelly and her
daughter were looking out of the win
dow and saw him. Mrs. Nellie Kelly
had the idea of dragging him. into the
house and locking him In till s,he sent
for the police and when she opened, the
door she grabbed hold of Monaghan's
shoulders. Divining her intention,
Monaghan "drew back and pulling a re
volver out of his pocket pointed it 1 at
Mrs. Kelly, but the hammer snapped
and before hÂ« could again pull the trig
ger she closed and bolted the door. She
was so unnerved that she fell in a heap
in the hallway. .
TRIES TO SHOOT WOMAX.
Shortly after 7 o'clock Monday, night
Monaghan^ rang the bell aV the Kelly
horrie, and when Kelly opened the door
Monaghan fired a shot at him, the bul
let piercing Kelly's clothing "and caus
ing a slight wound 6n hw right. shoul-*
der. Monaghan ran away as sodit as
he fired the shot. When* Kelly removed
his clothing the bullet,^ one of 22 cali
ber, fell to the .floor. I He was taken
to the Central Emergency [ Hospital,
where the wound was attended to, and
he* went home. . ' . . '
Frank Monaghan, a lineman employ
ed by the Pacific States Telephone and
Telegraph Company, made an unsuc
cessful attempt to kill Walter B. Kelly,
a stock cutter living at 844 Folsom
street, on Monday night and followed
it up by an attempt yesterday morn
ing UDon the life of Kelly's mother,
Mrs. Nellie Kelly, who lives with her
son. , The only reason assigned for the
murderous designs of Monaghan is his
illicit love for Kelly's yourfgwife. Aft
er his attempt upon Kelly's mother
be walked across the street and, open
ing his vest, fired two shots at his
he^art, but, the physicians say, neither
will orove fatal. / :
"The facts â¢ were not considered at
all?" v
"No, sir." , .
... "Subsecuent to that time did Mr.
Mahon say anything to you about the
merits of the case?" â¢
â¢ "Yes, sir; he said he had locked into
the matter and he could see nothing
to it but hate: that he had told Mr.
Cornelius he did riot believe Mr. Ding
wall was guilty of these charges at
all, but that we had been asleep and
let Mr. Cornelius do us up."
On cross-examination Attorney Hut
ton asked the witness whether Mr. Ma
hon had taken testimony at some other
time and he said he' did not know.
"Don't you know that the whole of
that testimony waÂ» ""delivered to Mr.
Mahon?" asked Hutton.
"I don't," replied the witness. "I
understand it was not."
The attorneys then submitted the
case on briefs.
George Dingwall, the former secreta
ry-treasurer of the Street Carrnen's
Union, and six others who were ex
pelled from the organization had an
other inning in Judge Hebbard's court
yesterday morning. The plaintiffs are
suing for a writ of mandate to com
pel the local division to reinstate them
to membership. | The contention of the
plaintiffs has been that the executive
committee of the union overstepped Its
jurisdiction when it expelled them from
the union. Dingwall has led the fight
and claims he was never given a hear
ing. . The, case. has developed the fact
that' the organization' has been rent- by
warring factions. 'r .. â¢.
Attorney; AdolphL.. Well, represent
ing the 'plaintiffs,- and- H. W. ,Hutton,
attorney for the/union, were in court
yesterday to finish the case. Two wit
nesses were examined and then the at
torneys agreed to submit the case on
briefs. fi
At a previous hearing of the case it
was showji that Dingwall had been
thrown out of the union for alleged
conspiracy. He had been summoned to
appear before the executive council and
he declined, to do so unless he was
permitted to have an attorney and
stenographer present. This request, he
alleges, was' refused. He therefore did
not put in an appearance and was ex
pelled from the organization. Dingwall
then appealed to John Mahon, presi
dent of the national association. The
latter made a special trip to this city
to hold an investigation. .
R. C. Cornelius was placed on the
stand yesterday .morning to answer a
few questions relative to stenographers.
"Do you know when the executive
committee first had information that
there was Â¦ a shorthand reporter or
stenographer that was a member of
the union?" asked Attorney Weil.
"Well, I am not exactly sure about
it. It was some time after Dingwall
was expelled from the association," re
plied Cornelius. Â«
J. H. Fairweather was jcalled in re
buttal by the plaintiff. He. stated he
knew Mahon and was present at the
meeting of the executive committee
when the investigation was held. -
"Was the evidence upon which Mr.
Dingwall was convicted considered at
that time?" he was asked.
"It was not," replied the witness.
"Were, the members that were ex
pelled allowed to make any statements
upon the merits of this case at that
time?" , ' . *
"Not upon the evidence; no, sir."
They Jeft home at 4:30 o'clock yester
day morning and were in the vicinity*
of the Cliff House at 7 o'clock. The
sea was rough and huge combing
breakers made navigation full of peril
for the cockle-shell craft of the crab
fishers. The Gelardis were born boat
men and had weathered waters far more

and the boat was wallowing in the
trough of the sea. Before the helms
man could make a move a huge roller
broke high over their heads and ' the
little boat filled to the gunwales.
-Weighted' with ballast and a gasoline
engine, the Familia Unita sank like a
rock. A succession of breakers poured
tons of briny water on the struggling
Italians, all their youthful brawn was
of no avail, and within a few minutes
both disappeared.
Two "brother?, Reulice by name, were
erasing in the vicinity. . They wit
nessed the swamping of the Samilia
Unita and saw the Gelardis drown.
While trying to reach the struggling
fishermen a breaker struck the Reulice
boat and their own preservation de
manded all their skill and attention un

oar were the only objects in sight when
they drew away from the scene of the
