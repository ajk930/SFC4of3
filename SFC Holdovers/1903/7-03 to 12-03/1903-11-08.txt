For the most part the soil was of a light
alluvial nature and presented no formid
able problems." This task would occupy
ten days with all hands busy, and as food
sufficient for four days alone remained,
some understanding with the Inhabitants
of the land and Pomba, their chief, must
needs tm come to as soon as possible.
The Batoncas still held aloof and as yet
scarcely one had been seen. The need for
a visit to Bangillo became the more ur
gent, therefore, and the scouts, thrown
out daily to bring Instant notice to Mel
drum's "Btronff camp in event of the en
emy's approach, were told to capture any
stray Batonca If they possibly could man
age to do so.
On the following morning a regular
system of operations was instituted and
alternate shifts of men either worked
under Meldrum's . direction or stood
guard, heavily - armed, to cover the re
treat of the operatives upon any sudden
attack. ThÂ© camp was only a hundred
yards' distant and a stout double zareba
had been erected about it, while upon
one side the cliff face effectively protected
the party from any surprise.
The work progressed steadily, and Mel
drum and Bessie watched each spade of
earth as it was thrown up from the foun
dation of the most promising ruin', while
Wlnstone remained In camp, overhauling
his cherished guns, and Fain, free of
sentry duty for the time being;, strolled
away alone upon private ends toward the
waterfall. - . â¢ . . .
He alonÂ© realized thÂ© waste of time and
labor before the little company; he alone
could guess at the weary hours and days
of toil that must be thrown away during
the forthcoming fortnight, and be alone

rcctly as now. they pained detail, op ;
pressed even Meldrum's sanguine spirit,'
and towered tremendous as the vast'en
circling cliffs themselves.
As yet no sign of the Batoncas had
been reported, although their capital lay
but a few miles distant, ajid Winstone's
ad\ ice to his friend was to waste no time.
"Pursue your quest for the hidden gems
and convince yourself of its futility as
quickly as possible; then retreat from a
territory wherein it is very sure we shall
receive no friendly welcome,"- he said.
The point to make for was the house
of the dead manâ that described In the
manuscript as lying outside the bounda
ries of the old capital. Upon the morn-
Ing after their arrival, therefore, a reg
ular search was Instituted, and the puz
zled Zanzlbaris and Soudanese were bid
to skirt about the confines of the old vil
lage to poke and probe the underwood for
evidences of any solitary ruin of indica
tions of a bygone dwelling place.
Several of Fuch outlying habitations
were found in varying distances from the
camp and within half a mile at most of
the Golden Falls, but none of them stood
under an umzimbete tree, a point specially
mentioned in the manuscript. As dead
Btumps and old, time-bleached fragments
of vanished forest giants abounded, how
ever, and many young shoots and sap
lings were rising about the deserted vil
lage to take the places of their dead an
cestors, no certainty of^ being upon the
wrong tack followed from the absence of
a big tree. Young examples of the um
zlmbete abounded and both Roy and Fain
were soon familiar with the shape and
itize of the "stony seed pods" mentioned
In the dead man's direction.
"Close at hand" were the words he had
employed, and upon the strergti; of this
direction Meldrum planned his future ac-_
tions. In all six fallen dwellings and the
foundation of one other, from which evi
dence of the fabric Itself had vanished,
were discovered within a radius that
might fairly include the habitation of the
bygone pioneer: and around and about
each of these ruins, to a limit of 100 yards
every way and to a depth of three feet,
Roy determined to explore. - â¢ \
Even then Meldrum was for returning

But when the gathering blackness of
"night overtook them and made further
progress Impossible no eight of the raid

fuming race at his inability to proceed
farther, and was the only one awake
when the next disaster overtook them In
the ehaae of an unexpected attack froth
all Bides of the camp by a grcal horle of
blacks, who by their overwhelming num
bers and the unexpectedness cf their as-
Fau'.t. completely overran the sleeping
travelers, and in almost less time than it
takes to narrate It had killed half of
Meldrum's force and taken the oth*r
half prisoners. Only Meldrum. Lord
Winstone and Tracy Fain, who formed a
6mall group In themselves when the at
tack came, escaped the awful slaughter
Â»n4 that only after they had fought Ilk*
ddGjcns.
For two days Meldrum pushed steadily
forward through a country almost desert
ed. -All the fighting men were to the
east, and In their train had passed many
women and children. There were some
vague rumors of a body of COO or 700
epcars, said to be pushing rapidly through
the Lunda country to join their fellow
warriors against Ongasse, but no sign of
these appeared, and in three villages
nothing was found but aged men and wo
men and young children.
Such apparent security led to some
slight relaxation of the rules of march,
and, the roads being fair and danger ap
parently remote, the people often scat
tered a little after camp was formed and
foraged or amused themselves as they
pleased. ,
On the third day while Lord Wlnstone,

Fain soon found himselfupon the ledge
of the cliff and there waited impatiently
for the rainbow's descending arch to lead
him to the goal.
It was long, however," before the critical
moment came, and meantime' the young
man "had opportunity to scan the sur

sharply, below Antelope Head bluff, and

-set forth in frantic haste. to find a point.
: from which one vast antler of the stone

this proved a difficult task, and after.*/,
dozen attempts to obtain such a position*
the:; treasure hunter fell back fifty yardsi
"or so and began to realize that the neces-*,

'cranny of the cliff-face. ' '; '-'.
Now he essayed a series of climbs, and
It was not until after an hour of rough
and fruitless work that he at last reached
a solitary' shelf, perched high above the
river, from which the great stone ead .
presented the necessary appearance. Two ,
fish eagles, frightened from their eyrie,
screamed in the* air so close that he could
see their crooked. beaks and golden eyes,*
but his mind was not upon them. - ,-
As he lay panting and weary under a
cloudless sky, he took in the bearings of
his position and realized two thingsâ that
the mist of the Golden Falls, could only
throw a rainbow soon after the sun had
risen, and that the point which' he now
occupied was the sole spot on his side of .
the river Â¦ from which Antelope Head
bluff might be seen In the necessary po- .
sltjon. .â¢ .. ..â¢ â¢ -
An hour, later' Fain was back in camp.
He explained his fatigued condition as"
the result of a stiff and difficult ..climb;
and the next morning, having declared
over night that he designed another .ex
piration on tho cliff face, set off alone
with his rifle and a day's prbvlsloni'
. The enterprise somewhat mystified
Roy, and- Fain's lack of interest In the
great search nettled "him; but, the -leader
of the band had plenty to think about, so
he contented " himself .by ... warning his
cousin to keep within call of the scouts
. and incur no unnecessary risks ' or dan- '
gers. . . : '. '"Â¦Â¦/..Â¦ . Â¦,
The usual noise .of the men pitching
camp was drowned by the tremendous
and reverberating -echoes of the Golden
Falls, and as light waned and all detail
vanished from the solemn - scene, Roy
turned away and sought his friends that
he might escape for a little space from
his own thoughts.
For one brief moment there came Into
his mind a shadow of the skepticism that
Wlnstone and Fain openly professed.
Seen afar off the difficulties appeared
small enough; viewed closely, faced di-
The Golden Falla of the manuscript
proved easy enough' to discover; but upon
reaching the district Meldrum found, that
the capita] of the tribe l'ad been shifted
two miles farther ud the Wambasl. The
ruins of the old, settlement were not dif
ficult to trace, however, and Roy gazed
upon the desolate scena with singled
emotions as It spread before him at the
end of the first day's march through Ba
tonca country.
Beneath his standpoint lay the desolate
spot where a fellow Englishman had
yielded up his life. A wide slope extended
to the river, and It was covered with
grass-grown tracks between the bleached
skeletons of ruined huts. Above this
plain huge cliffs rose, jagged and peaked,
under a red sunset sky, and down the
eternal faces of them leaped. In a suc
cession of sharp and gushing cascades, the
Golden Falls. The cliff front Inclined In
ward at a distance of a hundred feet
from Its base In the river, and the tor
rent, crossing this gulf at a bound, fell
with endless rosr upon the broad bosom
of the stream beneath.
A fittir.sr answer was returned to tfie
young ruler. Winstone and the other
Englishmen took his hand, British fash
ion, and Hook, when his turn came, made
the royal finger-bones crack with a shake
like a vise. Then Meldrum went upon
his way. and the expedition, after some
ten days' progress by short marches,
at last arrived on the banks of the Lua
pula.
"Now farewell, thou Queen of the Sliver

ed joy ar.d the strang-entsa of it all, and
la the mutual explanations which fol

for the boy king.
"Two cay3 after you departed," he tald,
"it came to my ear through scouts that

should meet my warriors. Then I knew
that the Masaegl roust surely fall in with

her subjects as my friends, they' would
most surely offer battle and perhaps
achieve a victory by force of numbers.
I'i'on this subject I debated for- the space

band, upon the track of the White Queen,
intending to reach her before she should

Fhow him the black and the red ants.
He will like them better than the white.**
The rest roared with -laughter and in
a few moments started to put In fore*
the hideous suggestion of their comrade.
Better had It been for Fainâ a thou
sand times betterâ had the black fiends,
whose prisoner he now was, thrown him
to a hungry lion or before & charging
eiephant. Then, though death had come
In shape horrible enough, it had been
speedy and merciful as the lightning; but
for the wretched man, now strapped with
living vines, his cruel captors designed an
end unutterably horrible, and a moment
later, almost before Fain bad realized
their intentions, they threw him on the
earth beside a low, black mound.
Here, in shape of a St. Andrew's cross,
they stretched him; then pegged down
hands and feet so that no effort could
free the tortured sufferer, and, that done,
h* dozen with their spears backed and tore
at the â¢Jark mound hard by, then Jumped
nimbly away as a - black and enraged
swarmâ relentless and savage as the
Eatoncas themselvesâ crawled forth to
lir.il the cause of this earthquake In' their
citadel.
Very quickly the pinioned soul upon the
ground knew what depths of torment
v ere reserved for him, and he stared Into
the unpltylng cky ar.d prayed as he had
never prayed before that death might
hasten to him In any other shape than
this.
But the black army of soldier ants fell
upon him in their myriads; he felt them
upon every inch of his exposed skin and
knew they were burrowing beneath his
garments. He shuddered under this literal
formication, and ice-cold shivers shook
him to the deep sources of his life.

lie clenched his fingers and slew 600,
but 2J0O crawled over the corpses of their
fellows. In live minutes he was a writh
ing, heaving mass of ants, a mere brute
lighting for its life and bellowing In
agony, with the cur3ed things in his eyes
and nose and mouth and ears, with a mil
lion cf them simultaneously burying their
pincers in his tortured skin.
To smother a man to death in mustard,
leaves would be a. similar death. The end
could net have been long delayed; but
Providence had further work for Tracy
Fain, and it was half a dozen of his tor
mentors not the maddened, choking
wretch himself who passed- at that mo-
ment into the Land of Shadows.
The Batoncas, intent on their devilish
pleasure, had not heard or seen the ap
proach of ileldnim and his little force;
und now, at a range of barely a hun
Â¦ dred ya:d3, a very effective volley was
poured into the savages and six of them
,. fell. Their wild laughter choked in their
Â¦, throats. Two others were wounded and
'.dispatched without a thought by Black
.*birii when he reached them, while thirty
.inore, who stood. firm for a moment and
â¢flung their spears ? were charged by Mel
drum and the Zanzibarls, as Wlnstone,
with his cranelike gait, ran to the man
upon the ground and at the cost of a
"terrible biting himself loosened the bonds
and bid him rise. \
Fain for the time appeared msane. He
screamed and laughed In a fit of frenzied
hysteria, and Jt was long before his nerves
eVen approached tranquillity. His awful
experience made his cousin mad also, but
with anger, and three of the Batancas
fell tÂ» his fury, while the Zanzibarls an
swered for four more.
â¢Thus In the space of five minutes no
less than fifteen of the savages were dead
and the rest had vanished to carry the
news of their defeat to their King.
Wlnstone's chief fear was for Tracy
Fain's eyes, but. though his head was
much swollen and his features almost un
recognizable from the action of the ant
â¢Â¦ poison, he could see. They half led. half,
carried him to the river, and there strip
ped and immersed him to the chin. This
. course served to allay some of the ex
cruciating torment from which he suf
fered, but he still raved and babbled in
" coherently, and It remained to be seen
whether his life would be spared or
whether the terrifio shock endured by
his Bi-stem was more than nature could
repair.
Presently they took him back to camp,
opened a can of tinned milk and dressed
the whole of his fevered body with the
stuff. A little very weak Btlmulant 'was
also given and every effort mads by
fanning and sprinkling of water, to keep
the air In the tent as cool as possible.

Presently, the watcher then, being
Meldrum himself, a thread of sense and
coherer.ee began to wind through tha
fever-stricken man's wild utterances.
"Not there." he said, "not there; and

his mind back to reality. The Batoncaa
were upon .him. Silent as snakes they
"had; crept In on every side, and._now, find

simultaneous cry and leaped forward.
Seeing his deadly peril Fain .dashed for
his rifle, but he was; tao late 1 to . reach it
and in. a moment the yelling mob closed
in. Now, face to ;face . with death and
powerless to fend a. single " stroke of the

Fain was bound hand, and foot with
the tough and trailing vine of the wild
grape. Thep four men picked him up and
bore him some hundred yards distant. A
swift Interchange of^vlews followed; some
of the savages were In. favor, of- carrying
the prisoner to Pomba, their King, while
others of the younger 'bloods < held that
the monarch need know nothing of the
matter. \ :'â¢'/_ Â¦[-,
Fain's heart throbbed wildly, for it was
r white ants'" nest. Its base was draped in
green things and grass sprouted upon it.
A part had crumbled away and the de
caying' mass presented many evidences of.
disintegration, but that it was an , ants'
nest Fain knew without question, and
that it must be the identical structure i
ho^sought seemed also certain, for no'
tftner similar erection appeared within
ifhe" radius of the trees.
[t To- the deserted nest he went and his
beat high as he stood beside it
' and knew that the treasure might beâ
nay, must bÂ«â within reach of his ex
, tended hand. Â¦ <
The base of the nest was coated with
moss and it rose from. wild undergrowth.
Tq cut this away was the man's first
task, and, setting down his rifle, he pulted
out- a heavy knife and began to clear the
r - base, of the.earthen pillar. This task was
quickly accomplished, and f" Fain j found
himself before a smooth but soft erection
Â»of flnÂ« fcarth. That it must be hollow in
Â¦ side-she knew and doubted not that the
adventurer, who trusted his treasure to
It In the past, had cut a hoiÂ© somewhere
at the bottom or in the side of the .mound,
then dropped In the umzlmbete seed pods
and afterward made all secure again.
For a moment he reflected as to what
course was the most simple, Â¦ then set to
work at* the base of the cone, and soon
had a hole, big enough to creep through,
driven to the center. Then he discov
ered what had not appeared from the
surface; there was another entrance from
underground Into, the nest. The -channel
ran a foot beneath the earth and came
out. ten yards â¢ away. That the deserted
dome had been used by some small beasts
. of . prey for a lair was evident, and now
Fain began digging down through aÂ«mass
: of bones and fragments of moldy fur to
reach the umzlmbete seed, which he knew
must be hidden beneath.
.The soil was light and he made rapid
progress, but never a sign of what he de
sired-was-there, lie sweated on* but his
heart almost hurt him with its thump-
Ing, bis head was throbbing and his eyes
aching 1.3 failure came nearer and nearer.
v He threw aside, the. stick- .he. had been
using and buried his hands in the , soft
mold. He tore it up, and as the subsoil
gfew harder he still used his fingers unlil
they were torn, one of his nails Vwbs
broken and both of his hands began to
bleed. Then he stopped and stared blank
ly before him,, while' the sweat .dripped
from bis face into' the great hole .he had

The precious stones were not; In the
ants* nest. They had vanished ; from It,
and Fain stood faced, not only with his
own -treachery, but \ with, the knowledge
that it had utterly failed. His sin was
vamrthe sting of the memory might last
forever; but there was nothing to make
him bear the bitterness of his wicked ac
tion with Indifference. Absolute failure
stared him in the face, and' In that black
moment he cursed his existence and wish
ed that he 'was dead. The wages of sin
is death, indeed, oftentimes; and now it
seemed that the traitor was to be taken
at his word. V
Dazed and stricken by his te?rible dis
. appointment, shattered before this crush-
Ing reverse, the man moved blindly away
and lifted his eyes to scan further and
satisfy himBelf that In reality- there was
no other white ants' nest within the In

THE
GOLDEN
FETCH
Sunday Call
Literary SectionThe magic word strongly â¢ affected not
only the troop of Batoncas behind them,
but also Pomba himself. His attention
was now called to the golden guardian of
the tribe, where it sparkled on the white
woman's" forehead; and as he gazed, a
scene of weird significance was enacted
among the rank and file of the monarch's
bodyguard. Before the precious symbol
each man passed, gazed at the familiar
figure on the gold, then dropped upon his
knees and touched the earth with his
head. -
Winstone was relieved to sea that
Bessie herself had bcooma an object of
some reverence at this crisis, and there
was no" effort made to crowd upon hor or
regain the fetich. She clearly stood un
der the * sheltering j aegis of Itâ a sacred
"thing, sharing the Indescribable virtues of
the golden amulet upon her forehead. *
Pomba, : however,;: did not '. partake in
this general veneration for '.the -disk, but
as a statesman, ha very fully realized the
value of the toy to himself, and now de
manded it. i- .Â» ,. '
"So! I epoke true words. I told you
what you would not tell me; and here is
confirmation. Bid yonder woman remove
Chinkakko from her brow. 'Twas borne

The girl came forward and stood be*
side Roy. - Then Pomba lifted his dark
eyes to her face and she saluted him
gravely.
Both Winstone and Meldrum saw the
Golden Fetich and shivered with appre
hension; but the King did not immedi
ately perceive it. He was intently ob
serving. Bessie's features, nevertheless.
They puzzled him a little â a circumstance
not strange, considering that never be
fore this moment had he seen a' white
woman. â¢
But his followers, with quicker eyes
than ' their monarch, had already per
ceived Bessie's scarlet frontlet and the
ornament it carried. They pointed,
stared in blank astonishment, then be

language to one of his head men, who re
tired to the main body; then he turned
to -Winstone.
"You tell mÂ« of rare gems and Jewels.
Tell me more about them. How did you
learn that such things were in the Ba
tonca country?"
"That we learned from our familiar. Tell
us how It is that you speak our language,
and we will tell you how we know there
are rare gems hidden here."
"You will not like the story; but I will
tell you. and I will tell you what you
refuse to tell me. I know, now that I
have taxed my brain," where you heard
of the shining stones. Let me be seated
and I will relate it to you. Then you
will know whether I am a friend or an
enemy."
A llg^t folding chair was placed for.
Pomba and a big umbrella opened and
held over his head. Oblivious to this at
tention, he proceeded with his 'cynical
narrative. His English was by no means
as perfect as that with which we credit
him, but, for the purposes of the story
and in order to save trouble in reading,
we may allow the monarch a somewhat
choicer diction and pronunciation than In
reality he exhibited.
"Know, then, that long, lno'g ago, when
I was a young man, I left the land of the
Batoncas. moved by some inner spirit, to
see and to know more than my own coun
try offered me. There had come a slave
raiding expedition Into our territory, and
though I escaped the Arabs, yet after
they had gone I was sorry that I had es
caped, for in me a spirit moved and told
me that the white men were wiser than
the black, and -I longed to share their
wisdom and store It in my heart.
"So I ran after them and traveled far^
through the heat of a' long season of
drouth and until four moons had waxed
and waned. But I never found J.hem,
though I had news of them once or twice
in the shape of burnt-out villages and the
bones of men picked clean by hyenas. So
I saw the white men were very strong
and held the black men In -their hand,
and I yearned with increasing desire to
know what the white men knew. â¢
"Then, in the Kalonga country. I was
at death's door from hunger, and I sank,
by the way and had perished there, but
another wanderer found me, and he was
also white."
Lord Winstone and Meldrum exchanged
glances. Roy only thought of the moment
and already suspected the sequel of tha
King's story, while Winstone, not con
cerned with details, looked on ahead and
ba a friend.
Seeing the huge disparity between the
opposed forces, one only way to success
presented itselfâ a cordial and complete
understanding with the Batonca chief.
At present everything rested with him.
Indeed, their very IJves were In his hand.
; The Kin* continued:
"You show some mutual understanding
in your eyes. I shall tell you why pres
ently, for I know what you are thinking
about; but now listen further and. do not
busy your brains until you have heard
what I am to speak to you.
"The white man saved my life. He gave
me food and drink.. Ha learned my lan
guage and I learned his after many days.
By night I struggled and sweated with
my, tongue and teeth, to fit them to^ the
words he used. I never slept until I had
repeated the hardest sounds many times
over and made them come right. And
then the white man poured great store of
white wisdom into my brain, and I gath
ered and gathered and gathered, as the
bee gathers honeyâ to use in time future.
"Meanwhile the white man wandered
far, seeking for a road to his people, but
I did what was in my power to keep him
from them and soaked his wisdom up, as
thirsty ground soaks rain.
"Then, on the banks of a. river that
attracted him in his wisdom of metals
and minerals and the things hidden un
der the earth, the man found great store
of small stones of divers colors that were
very good to him, and he told me that
these same dull pebbles, manyr-of them
less' 'in size than beads, were more pre
cious than cowries or ivory, than" skins
or Â¦gunpowder', than glass 'or anything in
the whole wide world. Whereat I saw
that too much" learning and wisdom and
deep knowledge of the ways of the stars
and eclipses, and of the sun j and ' moon,
had poisoned the man's head; that wan
dering through the world and never rest
ing his thinking parts had at last turned
the man's b'rain sour to his skull,. and I
feared that I should win no more wls- .
doxn from him. and that he would soon
babble empty nothings, like' an aged man,
or an infant, or those who are born; with
wind, in their heads instead of brains.
"But It was not so. The man's mind
continued to send, forth : great 1 stores of
learning:. And while each day he packed
my understanding with a new
and a new thing, I, on my side, worked
for him and befiiended him and made his
ways easy: for we were now approaching
. my own land, because the man desired to
go to the M'wootan N'zigo, the great
waters to thÂ« north, of Batonca. landâ
Â¦ those sweet, vast lakes that you call after
your queen and her husband, who is dead.
You see, I know all these thlnss. My
thought 'was to bring the white man to
my own people, that he might spread his
knowledge thrre and that I might win
greatness.
"8o thÂ«. time nassed by, and all the
while I crew in knowledge and wisdom
until one day, when we were camped in
the land of my fathers, the man sa*d:
'Lo! Pomba, my faithful friend and fol
lower, you are now grown wise as I.
There is 'no more that I can teach you.'
Then said 'I: 'There 1s ; yet another thine:
teach me why this dust and erravel that
you have gathered" bv the 'way Â«is valua
ble. Tell me wherefore these little hard
stones are precious beyond all earthly
things.'
"Then he answered. .'I cannot tell; but
men have agreed' that .- they shall so be
esteemed.-. The stones will be cut and
polished untif the fire hidden within them
flashes forth and gleams and sparkles
like the eyes of" the;whd boasts by night.
And then our" women will wear them
about their necks and wrists, upon their
fingers and Jn their hnir, for they love

me any morel Then we came to my na
tive land and built a house there beside
that ground you are vainly digging yon
der. M'wenga was king of the Batoncas
In those day3 and his village, stood here
long ago; but mine Is a marc,h distant.
"Next I schemed how best to become
very great and I found that with M'wen
ga, not with the white man, my hopes
rested.. So I played a double part . and
tempted the white man to say harsh
things to M'wenga, and translated the
white man's speech wrongly and made
M'wenga his enemy. Then arose the Ba
toncas against the white man and .he be
gan to go in fear. .
. "We had already planned to fly with
such stones as we could carry, but the
rest he had hidden in the forest beside
the Golden Falls, hoping that on a better
day, in time to come,' he might return his
gems. But he did not know that I had
changed .against him: he only knew that
the Chinkakko, the fetich of the Baton
cas/ was against him, according to the
chief, M'wenga. ' â¢
"The Chinkakko was a fetich of gold,
the guardian of the Batoncas, and it grew
bright If a man had good heart toward
the tribe and dull against him if he was
evil minded against us, according to the
wo'rds of the medielne men.
"So I threw In my lot against the white
man and, "going softly, went up to him
while his back -was toward me and his
pen busy making client words,' and stab
Â¦ bed him;. bo .that he rolled over; at my
feet. And I took the silent words he had
set on paper and gave them to the king.
And he was very' glad, and having no son
of his loins made me his son and set me
at hb tight hand. I But the silent words
did 'M'wenga take for high fetich, 'and he
. wrapped them round about Chinkakko,
and wore them upon his bosom for power
and protection, according to the fancy of
, the ignorant who know. not wisdom.
The KInp made an end of his long
speech, and his eyes looked far away
over the heads of the crowd about him.
For a moment Lord Winstone did not
answer. He, . too, was deep in thought.
Then, ignorant of what had passed and

"Then the 3atoncas came to me, and
I spoke in the way 1 with the white men,
for. I knew their tongue'; .and we made
a peace and gathered up the dust of
M'wenga and buried him as it Is fitting
to bury a king. But upon his breast we
found no fetich, for the white men nad
stolen Chinkakko from our father's neck
and with it the high fetich of the silent
writing. Therefore the silent writing and
the Chinkakko of the Batoncas passed
beyond the distant sea, and I reigned over
my people by force of wisdom and powei
until this da/.
"There is one thing more. You had not

You had not braved the unnumbered

And. further, you had known nothing of

are no gods. My familiar hath oftentimes
told me there are none."
"Have a care, King Pomba. Your fa

hidden gods are 'everywhere. They roll
the clouds together when it thunders;
they flash their eyes when it lightnings;
they weep for the wilderness of bad mon

servants of the gods and under the sign

up to the uttermost splinter the treasures
of shining stone, and we on our part will
make no claim upon your kingdom, but
render to you the Chinkakko and retora
to your tribe this fetich of healing and
power."
"Fool! I have put to raise my hand,
and you and your puny party are swept
away."
"Raise your hand, Pomba, and you
die," said Wlnstone, quietly. There was .
a .revolver in his hand. Each had his
eye fixed upon the other. Ten yard3 off
the Batoncas were still doing obeisance
to Bessie and the Golderl Fetich; while
Roy, with the help of the Zanzlbaris,
had opened a big case of beads and wire
and was presenting the warriors and head
men with gifts of exceptional value..
Pomba answered his lordship's threat.
"What Is death to me? I do not fear
It."
"Nor I; but a man is a fool to die. If
he can help It, before life has lost its
salt. You are in your prime. Power is
sweet, and knowledge is sweet. Why
fling a kingdom away, when you might
live to reign over it for fifty years more?
Consider your added strength If Chin
kakko returns to you. And all you give
in exchange is a handful of the ground
and dust, as useless to you as the ground
you walk on."
"Who are you, to offer terms to me?"
"The stronger party, In that the gods
are on my side. Regard your own fol
lowers. They are under the power of the
White Queen already. Bid them destroy
her! You hesitate, Pombaâ you fear them.
You have rujed by hard ways so long

"You speak as one of little memory."
answered Winstone. "It is not thus that
the Batoncas will treat the possessor of
Chinkakko; it is not with naked spears
that they. win welcome the White Queen,
who has traveled through a million perils
to bring them back their guardian that

"So b* It, Pomba. Until the day after
to-morrow we will awit your decision.
Longer we cannot wait. You boast your
wisdom; be wise now if you want to
keep your crown upon your head. Fare
well."
"You have the lion's voice, white man;
but you v lack the lion's paw. Farewell."
Pomba - arose from his folding chair
and Bessie approached him, carrying a
handsome coat of red cloth trimmed with
golden braid. A similar gift had delighted
many dusky kings, but this one waved it
aside, while his followers rooked on In
fear.
â¢ For a moment he stared at the Golden .
Fetich, then spoke to his bodyguard and
foremost men in harsh and angry accents.
That he had directed them to relinquish
their gifts was evident, but only a few
immediately obeyed him. He repeated
his command in a voice or thunder, and
the rest dropped ' their ' newly acquired
treasures, though with no small show of
surly reluctance. Then they took military
order and fell back upon the main body
of the Batoncas.
11 For one critical moment Wlnstone ap
prehended an Immediate attack, but his
big words and mysterious threats had not
been uttered In vain. There were, more
over, other causes In Pomba's camp why
an immediate onslaught was Impossible.
"We have a familiar also," answered
Meldrum boldly; "and our familiar has
told us that here, within the fringe of
the Eatoncas' country, hidden without
the boundaries of this deserted town,
there are great store of precious gems
diamonds, rubles and emeralds. These
things are of no service to Pomba, king
of this nation, but to white people they
s.re precious; and we come that we may
Clg up the stones if Pomba wills It, in
exchange for great store of rare fabrics
and treasures."
This speech produced an extraordinary
effect on the eavage king. He glared
speechless at Meldrum for a moment,
then at Winstone.
"By the lightning! this is a email earth
Pomba regarded Wlnstone, who made
this epeech, with a doubtful and sus
picious eye.
. "It is bo." he answered. "I have
learned many things of your ways and
customs. But that concerns you not.
Now answer me. What do you do in my
country, and why this upturning of land
beside the river? You search with great
searching. It is for more than ground
nuts that you hunt where the broken
earth meets my eye yonder. I am very

tended, Wlnstone and Meldrum. with half
a dozen armed followers, immediately left
camp and proceeded to meet the ap
proaching natives.
Then, to their undying astonishment,
the big man, who appeared scarcely
smaller than Roy himself when seen at
close quarters, lifted up his voice and ad
drehsod them in English.
"You milk-white wanderers. What do
you do here? Why do you come to Pomba
of the Biitoncas? He has nothing for you
ânothing at all; but you kill his soldiers,
end he expects good gifts for his dead
Boldjers before you leave his land."
The King, for it was Pomba himself
who Etood before them, appeared to be a
man of about W years old. His evil but
intelligent face was partly covered by a
thin beard, already turning gray; his eyes
wÂ«re set close together In his head, his
jaw was very square. He was attired
Eumewhat curiously for a savage, and
wore more garments than commonly a.\>
pear upon an African monarch.
"We are amazed, great King Pomba,
that you can epeak our language," be
gan Winstone, "but it is only what we
should have expected from one whose
fame is so widespread. We are here with
our White Queen, and we ask for the
hand of friendship and the palm branch
of peace. We slew some of your warriors
l>ecause they tooK one of our white men
prisoner and horribly tortured him. Had
you been with your soldiers you would
not have permitted such wickedness."
Pomba laughed and his eyes gleamed
cold and dull, like a toad's.
"You cpeak of a Queen," he said, "but
you have only one queen, you English.
You lie to me. Your Queen would never
come among my people with no more
than a handful of white men and coast
folk. You have no Queen."
â¢ "She is our Queen- notwithstanding,
and when you see her you will know that
it is so. You cause us to marvel much,
King Pomba, for your soldiers walk in
line like our soldiers at home, and you
speak in our tongue and have much learn
ing and knowledge hidden from the races
.of the black men."
The scouts fell in one by one; the open
ings cf the little fortress were closed and
every precaution made for fighting if it
Ix-came necessary.
Bessie, well accustomed to tha farce of
appearing as a queen before tha local
potentates, retired to her tent, and on
this occasion bedecked and. adorned her
eelf with greater care than usual. Moved
by. a sudden whim, 6he took the golden,
fetich from Its case, threaded a needle
and quickly stitched the talisman upon a
red ribbon and fastened it round her fore
head.
"Now we will soon know if it means
anything cr not." 6he thought.
Meanwhile, marching with the regular
ity and discipline of civilized troops, a
regiment of about five hundred Batoncas
epprcached. and as they came nearer it
v, ., > clear that half a dozen men of mark
walked before them.
About an hour after Hook had departed
on his food seeking mission, upon the
edge cf the woods, at tha limit of the
ruins of the old town, there appeared
large bodies of natives, and Wlnstone rub
bed his eyes and his glasses when he saw
them, for "their movements were wholly
unlike those usually employed and dis
played by savages.
"It's a deputation or something, but.
irreat Scott! look at the formation.
They're moving as regularly and stead
ily as English Infantry. Who in thunder
came here to drill the rascals?"
But Meldrum had only stopped to see
the advancing horde. Now be sounded a
bugle and soon everybody outside the
zareba was back behind it.
Soon matters of more general Impor
tance than Faln's health occupied those
responsible for th* welfare of th* expe
dition. Two du's' food supply only re
mained, and th* difficulty of obtaining
any more in B&tonca territory was gr*at
ly lncrtased sine* th* previous morning.
Indeed, after the destruction Incidental to
the rescue of Fain any hopes of a friend
ly understanding with Pombs, appeared
remote. Tee King must surely resent
u.:s assault en bis subjects, and it was
unlikely that it would be possible to make
him understand th* justice of It.
Pians were hastily formed and a forag
ing party of a dozen men under Hook dis
patched a day's march backward for fur
ther rrovlsions. There were plenty of
friendly natives at the junction cf the
Wambasl and Luapula rivers, and here
Dans little party would be able to pur
chase plaintains and possibly goats and
fowls. In forty-eight hours they would
return with four days' more provisions.
Meanwhile the exploration was pushed
on. and WinstonÂ© advised that a mes
senger should be sent to Pomba with
gifts; but here was a problem, for no
white man could be spared, and neither
Zarzibaris nor Soudanese would volun
teer. Bungani and Blackbird, indeed, of
fered their services, but they were not
accepted, and what course to pursue was
Btili an 'oWect of discussion, when the
question was 6ettled. once for all, from
the other side.
Morning brought with It perceptible Im
provement in Faln's condition, and at th*
breakfast tour ha slapt *Â© soundly that
Winston* advised h* should not b*
vakanad.
Failure had. upon his own oonfitslon,
attended some enterprise hidden from
the rest of th* expedition, and this fact
was now in Meldrum's poesesslooâ hurled
at him amid the long hours of night by
a fevered and frantlo man, but ha very
gladly dismissed th* subject when dawn
broke, though henceforth h* was awak*
and alive to protect himself, ready to
leap at any future hint of knavery, deter
mined to have a full and complete ex
planation of his actions and utterances
lrom th* sick man when health should
be restored to him.
But Meldrum, though aliv* to th* fact
that he had overheard some dark secrets
end stood upon tha threshold of most un
expected treachery, yet kept his own
counsel. That Tracy Fain had not ruc
cc-tded In an effort to circumvent him was
ail that mattered at present.

"That raises the first question. At* you

Wlnstone cuietly.
â¢ Pomba hesitated before answering. Then
tha small size cf the party, their appar
ent wealth Â»nd his own much greater
power evidently determined him to be in
solent. . Â¦
J "My warriors could eat you up and not
know they had partaken of food; you
have not beads enough to give one to
each fiphtlnj? man in my army. Why
should I be your friend? You are no

"You ppeak as one ignorant of the
facts." answered Winstone. * "Yet your
familiar knew something about repeating
rifles I'll wager if he was an English
demon."
"I, too. have rifles."
"Possibly; "but no powder. Tour fa
miliar wasn't clever enough to teach you
how to make that. We can give you a
great store of powder. We have brought
It for your friendship, but we cannot trust
you yet." If you advance toward us with
your soldiers we will burn all the powder
away at them. So you would lose a pre

Pomba did not answer this point Im

But Wlnstbne had not noted the awi
and respect of thÂ» Batoncaa toward the
fetich' for no thin*. He appreciated Its
possible priceless value at this Juncture
and determined to Dlay a big jam*. f
*"O, King Pombal" he cried, "let It be

j "What mad speech Is this?" roared

Ished, and Meldrum's expedition was left

Wlnstone hastily put the case to hisv
friend and explained how. In his Judg
ment, the Golden Fetich might, after all.
prove the salvation of the expedition and
the means whereby the > main object
Â¦ houM yet be achieved.
"Pomba knows where your jeweler's
shop isâthat's very clear. The cold
blooded brute killed the poor beggar who
found them, then hid them somewhere
and sealed the treasure with the seal of
Chinkakko âwhatever that means."
"It means this strange design on the
fetich, J expect," hazarded Roy. "But
what's our next move?" ne continued.
"Shall we wait for the two days? I sup
pose we must. Anyway, that will give
E>an time to rejoin U3." Â¦
"Yes. and meantime I must take a les
son or two from Mabruki- The chap
says he knows Batonca, or a little of itâ
so I'm elad we didn't hang him. We
tnust appeal to the mass of these people
through their superstition and reverence
|or the Golden Fetich. My own belief
at that our friend Pomba has foes in his
>wn household. If we could get his war
riors to mutiny against him. wo might
â¢core a bloodless victory after all. and
witness the exhilarating spectacle of Miss
Ogilvie crowned Queen of the Batoncas In
right of the Golden Fetich; but that would
lead to a good many subsequent difficul
ties. My hope is that Pobmba. seeing dan
ger, and perhaps not too certain of how
his troops would like making war against
their blessed Chinkakko, will climb down
and hand over the gems in exchange for
the fetich."
Mabruki's alleged knowledge of Baton
ea amounted to vary little, but some few
useful words proved to b* at hi* com
mand and half a dozen phrases waff
learned by Winstcno and Meldrum. Thes*
they taught their little force and it was
explained that, should It be neceesary to Â«
fight thÂ« people of th* land, they must T
advance to battle shouting: "W* con
quer under Chinkakkot" "Tha guardian
â¢f ths Batoncas leads us to victory I**
"The whit* queen Is th* chos*n of Chia
kakko!"
Winstona hoped that th*a* war criw
might carry weight, and hÂ» also trusted
that the King's bodyguardâthose Baton
caa who had seen the fetich and witness
ed Bessie's kindly Intentions toward
themâwould blaxe abroad the wonder
among their friends.
Later in the day. with a vi*w to g*t
tlng general information of the land and
ascertaining the position of BangUlo.
King Pomba's capital. Meldrum, Black
bird, Mabruki and two others of tha hard
iest and speediest from among the Sou
danese started Just before sunset for a
nocturnal survey of the adjacent Baton
ca headquarters. A full moon would light
them and as there was but one main road
carved through the thick forests from the
old capital to the new, no chanca of a
mistake existed.. Any force sent against
the expedition would have to meet Mel
drum and his scouts.
'
They took their Winchesters only, and
thus lightly cumbered proceeded at the
trot and made rapid progress. The
ground sloped southwesterly when two
miles of the forest had been traversed,
and as the moon flooded the plain with
light and the river with silver. MeldruiSf
who had called a halt of ten minutes on
leaving the woods, walked forward some
fifty yards alone.
An open space, much trampled and ,
evidently used for meetings or cere
monies here extended. It was surround
ed on the three sldÂ«s by the woods, while
on the fourth side a path wound down
ward to the valley plains, and far be
low, on both sides of the Wambasl, glim
mered the thatched Leehlve roofs of
BangUlo.
It appeared a colony of exceptional size,
spread under the moon; and though the
night was now far advanced no imme
diate signs of slumber had yet overtaken
the native settlement. Red lights gleamed
and twinkled everywhere, hurrying hither
and thither, like sparks on a piece of
paper that has Just been burned: and
presently from this winding, ever-chang
ing galaxy of torches, a definite forma
tion took shape and a little shining band,
dwarfed by distance to a mere worm of
fire, crept out of Bangillo and slowly as
cended the hill in the direction of Roy.
As this troop departed Meldrum noticed
that the bustle and stir behind it ceased,
and before the detachment under its
ruddy torches had proceeded a mile from
the village, all lights had been extin
guished about the dwelling houses and
streets. Bangillo slept, but the red worm
climbed onward until Meldrum saw that
It was approaching by th* steep path up
theÂ» hill and would soon be wher* h* him
self was standing.
The extreme smallness of th* natlv*
forca now approaching impressed Bx>*
not a little and served to render th* lÂ£?
cident void of alarm. Five and twmnty
to thirty persons represented tha full
strength, of the procession, and as they
came nearer, under nickering torchlight.
Meldrum made out som* detail. ob
served that many figures In fantastlo %
raiment marched together, that a litter,
on which lay a single shape, was car
ried in tha midst, and that ons maa of
great size with torchbeaxers on his
right and left marched at th* h*ad ez
the approaching company.
Guessing that their destination was th*
open space at tha edge o* th* wood be
hind him, Roy now fell back and In
formed his companions of th* approach
ing procession. A hasty survey Â©f til*
meeting place showed a rise of roojfr
stones at its center and on* loftl*r boul
der In the midst. This hypaathral cham
ber was evidently much fragmented, and
Meldrum suspected It must b* a sort
of parliament house or council ball of th*
tribe.
Immediately outs'd* th* ring appeared
another stone, - black with, blood loos
shed, while also at hand lay th* eharr*d
ashes of numerous fires â Indications
that led the beholder to ehang* his
mind and assume ha stood within som*
grim Golgotha or place of sacriflo* acd
execution.
Now. however, came Â«sounds of ap
proaching voices and tha torchlight
and moonlight strove for mastary.
whereupon Meldrum and his party fell
back into the frlnga of tha forest, and
there in safe htdltg, watched tha Baton
cas. Some thirty of them appeared, set
their torches in a ring around the circle
of stones and immediately busied them
selves about various matters. .,i
Their burden they first deposited upon
the ground; then ten aged men. attired
in bizarre garments of many colors,
sat round the stone rostrum: their gi
gantic leader mounted it to harangue
them from tha summit; whllo the rest
of the party wcr9 active with prepara
tions among the dead fires close by.
These men planted two heavy tree
stumps, each six feet high, at a distance
of six yards apart, then built up be
tween them a square and solid pile of
brushwood.
Meantime Mabrukl. at Meldrum's far.
translated, as best he could, the speech
of Pomba to his medicine mÂ«n. For
Pomba himself it was who presided at
this weird scene of fiery words and sav
age de*ds under the silver mnon

CHAPTER XTTTt
2THE SUNDAY CALL.
skins, bright spearheads and swaying pie
bald shields, the savages fought In clouds
of dust, hacking, stabbing, disemboweling
and shrieking like demons. Everywhere
along the struggling lines, in the wild
whirl of writhing figures and spattered
blood, they were at death grips, tearing
at each others' throats, stabbing, rending,
slaughtering and being slaughtered.
Maimed men fought on till they were
knocked upon the head; strong men leaped
over the twisting bodies of their stricken
companions; here a dozen went down in
a glittering mass, like a Rugby football
scrimmage; but few ever rose to their
feet again; here dusty, bloody fiends
forced a way through their enemies, then
turned with reeking knives to hack a
road back again; here Individuals, separ
ated from their friends and foes, fought
hand to hand, wrestling and falling and
blindly groping with dying hands or seek
ing with eyes already growing dim. for
fallen knife or spear.
A noise like the etob and flow of a
heavy sea rose from thÂ« battle, and It
was soon apparent that their aid most
be given quickly and freely. So. revolv
er in hand, they plunged into the line and
strove to support the swaying Sags.
which waved along the face of the fight.
All the banners still stood. Then a
sudden sortie threatened one. and Mel
drum, calling to Mabnikl and Blackbird,
made for the spot HÂ« was fighting with
a clubbed Winchester, and the butt of
the weapon showed the hideous nature of
the blows it had dealt Now, himself cov
ered with blood and a spectacle of terror,
Roy went forward, and In a moment had
mowed a way for himself through the
enemy. He turned Instantly and fought
his way back, while Blackbird performed
the same feat with equal success.
But Mabnikl was less fortunate. The
poor fellow slipped, recovered, slipped
again and went down, while before Roy
could reach him half a dozen spears had
passed through his body. A second later
two of the men who had killed the Arab
were themselves dead on top of him. one
with a smashed skull and scattered
brains, another shot by Blackbird. Then
the hunter and Roy struggled clear from
the conquering advance of their friends
to note how the battle raged elsewhere
and at what point their aid was most
required.
On one side Winstone's small force had
joined Latossi. and success was attending
them, for they were fighting In splendid
order and with a solid front that crum
bled the opposition before It They moved
over gory red ground and the reek of
blood hung in the air behind them.
But to the rfght Roy's friends appeared
to be barely holding their own. Here the
Batoncas were unaided, for the full force
of the Zanzabarls and Soudanese was now
thrown Into the center of the battle, and
Meldrum saw with alarm that many of
his own men lay among the black corpses
that strewed the hillside.
Neither Ogilvle nor Fain was visible, and
Meldrum only had Blackbird and a one
armed Zanzibar! at his back, but, pick-
Ing up a loaded rifle from a' dead man.
he pushed ahead with the others, and soon
his presence Inspired his followers with
confidence and checked a threatened
panic.
The expedition was now gaining ground,
and the combined forces under Roy had
carved their way to the plain. Desperate
fighting still continued; then an unpre
meditated action went far to decide the
Issue. #
Up aloft Dan Hook, finding that the
battle was retreating from beneath him,
and never for en instant In his own mind
doubting Its final Issue, proceeded to near
er quarters, and the few Batoncas told
off to stand by him now advanced gladly
enough under Bessie's great green and
white flag.
Even through the din of the battle the
shouts of the approaching company
could be heard, and the cry of "Chlnkak
ko! Chinkakko comes!" fell on the* ears
of a foe already worsted at most points.
A last frantic effort the veteran Baton
cas made, and at the bitter end of the
battle those that could do so stood and
fought like despairing* demons. For a
terrible five minutes, that seemed to the
onlookers a century, the -alance trem
bled, but fate was on the side of the
smaller and stronger battalions.
The encounter had much diminished In
extent, and now, instead of ranging over
half a mile of hillside Mt centered to a
point Here. In smoke and smother of
dust and blood, the exhausted warriors of
Pomba made their last stand and dealt
death to right and left, killing two for
one.
But though they knew It not. the lines
behind them were in flight, for Pomba
himself, who watched the battle from a
knoll upon the plain, had hastened off thÂ«
field, knowing defeat to be but a question
of minutes, and behind him retreated
many of his soldiers.
"The king has fled! Your king has
given you to us!" shrieked Meldrum's
men when the truth crept through the
battle, and upon that all fighting ceased
as if by magic.
.Without a king or commander the sav
ages would risk their lives no more, and
now they flung down their arms and will
ingly surrendered to the victorious ser
vants of Chinkakko.
So the battle of Bangillo ended.* and thÂ»
conquerors had breathing space to look
about them and count the cost.
CHAPTER XXVL
DEATH OF .JNO POMBA.
When the duration of the* battle came
to be considered It was seen that the death
roll had proven terribly heavy. About
equal numbers of the Batoncaa had fallen
as a result of their hand-to-hand encoun
ter, but ere they met Meldrum's guns had
gone far to equalize the contending forces,
and more than 200 of the savages werÂ»
slain by bullets before and after they
joined issue with their opponents.
Another hundred or so had been wound
ed and put out of action before- the civil
battle of Batonca against Batonca began,
and in round numbers, at thÂ« end of thÂ»
conflict not 400 uninjured members of
Pomba's force were left upon the field to
acknowledge Chlnkakko victorious.
Another 100 or more had fled with their
king, and the total number of killed and
wounded amounted to nearly TOO men â an
extraordinarily high proportion consider
ing that Pomba's total force hardly ex
ceeded 1300. Of these more than 300 were
slain outright; while, upon the other hand,
Meldrum had lost about 2S0 Batoncaa
killed and 100 wounded, while eight of the
Zanzlbaris were slain. Including poor
Mabrukl, and two of the Soudanese*.
Four Zanzlbaris were wounded, no&a
dangerously; two wera missing; and of
the heads of the combined fores, Roy
himself and the king's son, Latoul, wera
wounded; Wlnstone was safe; Bcsalo,
Dan Hook and their euard were all un
hurt, and Richard Ogilvle and Tracy Fain
were both missing.
Of the second none had seen any ilga
since the original attack on the hlllsldo;
of -the first, several of the Zanzlbarla
avowed that on Pomba's retreat. OgUvla,
who was the first to witness it had called
a dozen Batoncas to him. addressed them
hurriedly In their own language and led
them into Bangillo.

He left Bessie In her tent, and*Buhganl.
according to custom, laid his own blanket
at the entrance and curled up within call
of his mistress. ;
-And then the noise and Jangle of steel
gradually subsided and the camp slept,
while only the dark forms of the watch
men" prowled < around Its outskirts under
the moon to the wakeful thunder of the
river. f \
Before a first white finger of approach
ing" dawn was laid upon the forehead of
the Golden Falls, Roy Meldrum had
blown his bugle, half a hundred fires had
sprung into being and the little army sat
busy at breakfast. None of the camp fur
niture was taken, but the force, in full
fighting trim, set forth, with nothing but
their gourd water bottles and weapons of
war.
Each regiment comprised a hundred Ba
toneas. under their own leaders. Of th.ese
thefe were four, and all went forward the
prouder for one of the flags manufactured
by Ogilvle. while Latossl, with a body of
ISO men, marched next, and the Zanzlbaris
with the Soudanese. Meldrum. Fain and
Ogilvle brought up the rear of the flght
ing'men.
Dan Hook had undertaken the task of
commanding, the little bodyguard of-Bes
site,* and Bunganl carried her flag. They
were to show themselves upon the hill
side.when the fight began; but Dan was
to look to It that they never approached
within spearshbt of the combatants.
As each detachment reached the Death
Place of the Batoneas it drew^ up out of
sight of the plain beneath, and then,
when his army was assembled, Meldrum
stole forward to look for Wlnstone's sig
nal. But he Â¦ found It possible to com
municate with his friend by a scout, as
Winstone 'was only a quarter of a mile or
less down I the hill, and Mabrukl soon
crept unnoticed to his ambush.
. His Lordship reported that, with the
exception of one body of the Batoneas,
about 100 strong, who had. left Bangillo
at dawn and were now posted in a rocky
fastness within 800 yards of the summit
of the mountain, the road was clear to
the plain beneath.
Far below, Pomba's troops were astir
and moving out of, the capital. As yet
scarcely half of them had taken the field,
and not a moment was to be lost if Roy's
forces desired to reap the advantage of
their early start. Now the smaller army
advanced and the blacks moved steadily
and swiftly, keeping wonderful forma
tion considering the steepness and rough
ness of the way.
The regiments proceeded at great pace,
and Roy,, with Fain, four of the best
Zanzibarls, three Soudanese and fifty of
the Batoncas, advanced at the double to
sweep before them the enemy hidden on
the hillside in the rocky pile ahead. But
the Batoncas posted here had vantage of
ground and, though unprepared for any
attack, they, made instant preparation
upon finding themselves discovered, and
greeted Meldrum's force with a shower of
spears, which dropped two men before a
shot was fired.
Wlnstone from his secret hiding place
cursed his big friend's method of attack,
but Meldrum pushed Impetuously for
ward, ' and soon little puffs of smoke
leaped along the hillside as the Zanzl
baris,' Fain and Roy opened fire.
A couple of volleys brought the Baton
cas tumbling out of the rocks, and soon
the rival forces Joined in a swaying,
struggling mass, while the sharp, inces
sant crackle of revolver fire proclaimed
that Roy and his companions were in the
thick of It with their black friends. The
position was rushed In less than five min
utes, but at heavy cost Â° , .
When all was practically over Meldrum
himself charged five of the foe hemmed
like rats in a trap between some heavy
boulders open above to the sky. But their
position rendered the warriors desperate,
and, after one had fallen, Roy discovered
that his revolver was empty.
Other weapon he had none, for he had
flung down his rifle outside the opening,
and now, at close quarters, he dropped a
second Batonca by hurling- his heavy re
volver at him. It hit the naked man over
the heart and he went down like a stone,
but. at the same moment his companions
were upon their huge enemy, and a spear
gashed open his shoulder. He hit out and
staggered the man; then he felt another
stab- on the face, and was turning again
when two more Batoncas sprang from
hiding and advanced at a run to iheir
companions.
Meldrum was hidden from the eyes of
his own party, but had Just time to .raise
one. tremendous shout He set his back
to the rocks and must, one moment later,
have perished In that position, for two
spears thrown simultaneously from
close quarters would both have transfixed
him.-but between Meldrum and this flying
death, like some shield of a tutelary god
dess dropped from heaven, there fell or
leaped a heavy object from the rock
above. In this the spears buried them
selves and Meldrum, blinded by the blood
that poured from his face, slipped at the
same moment and half rolled down a
sharp declivity between the rocks.
'His shout had brought half a dozen
friendly Batoncas to his aid, and they
now climbed upward and slaughtered
their, caged enemy, while Meldrum, stag
gering back to where he had left his
rifle, reloaded it, bound up his head and
pushed on down the hill as fast as ha
was able.
.Firing had now become general, and
the riflemen at long range were making
very good practice on the dense ranks of
thV Batoncas. They poured. In a steady
fusillade from a position above their own
black friends, and Ogilvle. seeing the ad
vantage of this maneuver, now signaled
to Winstone to brine up his force, for
every shot was telling at a range of a
quarter of a mile, and the powerless Ba
toncas could do nothing.
As Wlnstone came Into position and
added his fire to the rest. Roy regained
the. ranks. Then, after enduring another
volley, the enemy, at a word of command,
began to open out, in order to lessen their
losses.
To hold back the Batoncas under the
Chlnkakko banners was no light task at
this juncture, but at length, as Pomba's
forces received . the word to charge, Mel
drum, only waiting until the veterans of
the enemy were on the foothills of the
slope, released hli own party and the bat
tle began in earnest
Behind the oncoming foe, however, ex
tended a brim black lino of dead and dy
ing, and Winston* computed that Pom
ba's active warriors must exceed those of
the expedition by little more than 200
when the actual crash of contact came.
Meldrum, with advantage of ground,
looked like holding the day at first but
the old soldiers began -to do terrible exe
cution at close quarters, and soon the hill
was running red* streams of blood upon
its dusty face.
Under the gleam of thÂ« rising sun,
where It flashed on shining, sweating
A spirit of disaffection spread, like wild
fire among .the ypunger-- troops, and La
tossi, * Pomba's own son, r fostered It.
Every man . regarded his â neighbor, with
suspicion, and the" air "was. full'of dread
and danger, of 'pending "change and 'Â¦Â¦ of
the murmur of frightened men i .and

observe the spirit abroad among them.

The veterans stood firm and were pre

In them, but, Â¦', under;; cover off night and
by secret and preconcerted signals, ' many
hundreds of the younger meri crept singly

then departed .to gather at the Death
â¢Place under Latossl. Thence.' by a swift
march" the -rebels reached "Meldrum's
campatdayllght'.; | -;â¢',.
Now they announced their intention to
enlist under Chlnkakko, and this "attitude
and determination in & body amply large
enough to have wiped out Meldrum's en

"What guns have you ?'-'.: asked Richard
Ogllvie. .'.'With,' say, .thirty repeating
rifles and 'men w,ho can use;them, added
to "those, black troops, ;- you would have ' a
good chance' of , beating Pomba. Hecom
nfands rather more than a thousand men,
stillâ say' 1250. . And they're better troops
than these, because older and experienc
ed. " However, I understand them pretty
well by this time. If you've got thirty re
peaters and can rely upon the men's
shooting, you ought to win."
"Thirty-two, as a matter of fact," said
Meldrum.
Â¦ "Then go ahead. Accept the service of
these people; make blood brotherhood
with Latossl, who Is a very, gaol Bacon
ca, and promise him the throne of the
kingdom In a week." ,â¢â¢
Ogilvie's advice was. followed.' Meldrum,
through Bessie's father, proclaimed that
Chlnkakko received .the warriors gjadly,
and as the Batoneas brought two days'
rations for 600 men with them they were
welcome enougqh In more ways than cne.
Roy now decided to~waste.no time in
'giving battle and It was determined to
march against Bangillo at dawn on tna
following morning. . - :".'..-.
All that day stragglers kept dropping
In from Pomba's forces, and they brought
news that the King, still â¢ obdurate and
alive to what he must expect, was fortify
ing Bangillo In some measure to protect
the women and children, -but he had de
cided . that the pending 'battle should be
fought upon the plain, .< outside the city
stockades. Here, immediately below the
steep tracks that wound down from thS
Death Place to the valley : . beneath; Pom
ba,'. meant to challenge the further ap
proach of. his enemies. â¢ â¢..-â¢â¢â¢Â¦ - % 'Â¦ â¢ ; Â¦=
"His plan will be to hem us in and he
will .probably hays . a good' force hidden
on. the mountain 'Side, In such, a position
that It can rush down upon us from above
after we have - descended, "_ "explained
Ogilvie; J'but our object Is otherwise. We
must' 'clear the. way as we goâ both to
right a-.d leftâ then use the hill as a base.
Our i.xu.0, must do all they can to lessen
the numbers against us before the Baton
eas meet at close quarters. Once they
are at the grips It will b&*difflcult to
know who are friends and who are foes."
That night the order of battle was ar
ranged and Pomba's son informed of the
part he and his warriors must take. He
showed great intelligence and offered
several practical hints from- his personal
knowledge and experience of such . sav
age-warfare as lay before .them. ; . ;*.
After dark an advance column of fifty
Batoneas and five Zanzibarls with Wln
stone and Blackbird,, set out to' establish
themselves on the hillside overlooking
Bangillo. It was hoped by this means
to anticipate the enemy and prevent the
establishment of any seer 3t force that
might subsequently attack . â¢ Meldrum's
army from the rear at a critical moment
in the battle.
The hillside was, up to the present, at
the mercy of either party and such was
its constitution that a thousand men
might have lain concealed in its patches
of dense brush and broken piles of vol
canic rock. A system of signals, wit f a
red, white and yellow handkerchiefs for
flags, was hastily arranged between Mel
drum and Wlnstone, and each carefully
conied the code. .- " *
Thus on reaching the top of the hill
next morning Roy would learn where his
party was posted and at what point, if
any, the Batoneas lay. Supposing a com
pany of them to be concealed on the high
ground, Meldrum's first move would be
to charge them and sweep them into the
valley before him. ,â¢Â».--
Few slept that night All looked to
their arms; the riflemen ..received 200
rounds apiece, and while Meldrum,. ar
ranged for Bessie and a' strongly armed
force to remain well at the" rear, upon the
following day and be under no-imme
diate danger at any time. Offilvie bor
rowed the golden fetich. and, having: cut
half a dozen gaudy flags from the rolls
of brightly colored fabrics, with his
daughter's aid, he stitched upon each the
black design of Chinkakko on a huge
scale. â¢ Â¦ ' -. Â¦ Â¦ . -
'Our fellows will hold these, rags sa
cred," he explained, "for they have the
badge of the guardian of the tribe upon
them, and where a flag waves there will
be Batoneas to protect It while; they can
crawl. The biggestâ this white and green
one â I shall hammer to a* lofty, pole to
morrow and it. must Â¦ be â¢ carried - before
you. The niggers are fighting for the
white queen, the possessor of Chlnkakko;
remember that." s '
"The more they see of me the better,
then," said Bessie. â¢ . ,- . . . . ...
"Yes; it will put heart into them, but
be cautious.. God knows, that I would
never forgive myself and Meldrum would
never forgive me If harm ' happened to
you through word of mine.", >â¢- v â¢
."You are my dear father," she said.
"I cannot accustom myself i to the word
ret. But It 1 is very beautiful to ' me to
speak it And youâ you will run Into no
danger either. . You are old now and you
have suffered enough.!' ' - â¢'. Â¦ , â¢,â¢ " / ><
"Do not fear for me. I want my own
that Is all. I have suffered enough, as
you say. I can only revenge a part of It
But there is one must answer to me for
what is mine and for the hell on earth
my years have been; there Is one traitor
[ wouldâ but what idle, talk Is, this! Come,
child, take your rest and pray to God for
those who are dearest to you In the world
me In mind of others that were at some
time or another familiar to me." "â¢â
. At this moment Bessie's voice reached
Meldrum's ear. She had Just taken, a
little dish, of . soup to the beehive tent , of
straw, where the stranger lay sleeping,
and now, a moment later, her loud scream
startled Meldrum, who hastened to the
spot accompanied by Winstone and Fain
and followed by several of the Zanzlbaris.
Within the little chamber Bessie lay
extended # ln a dead faint, while the
"stranger- sat up amid his blankets and
looked .with wild gray eyes at the ap
proaching men. .' Â¦'- \
"What In God's name is, this? What
has happened? I was dreaming of days
long past and living again my youthful
life, when a scream i cut short -my
dreams and I awoke to find this girl
lying here at my feet Insensible."
The Zanzlbaris peeped and chattered at
the entrance;- Wlnstone answered the un
known one and Roy set about restoring
his sweetheart.
Bessie had evidently been much moved
or startled, for .the girl did not faint
easily; but seeing that It was her cry
that had awakened the sleeper, it ap
peared difficult to -understand what had
happened \ to . occasion her such concern.
Soon, however, she came to her senses
and then explained what had occurred.
In his sleep the rescued sufferer was
living again the life of the past and a
name upon his tongue roused the girl's
interest, while his subsequent utterances
chained It.
The man indeed .was Richard Ogilvte,
the long: lost wanderer, the brother of
Alister Ogilvle and the father of Eliza
beth. .
The parent and child, thus miraculous
ly restored each to the other, .were left
together awhile, for Bessie had now re
covered and was well able to tel\ her
story to her father and acquaint him
with the death of his wife, and the ter
rible end of his brother.. .
. In camp, meantime,' there were â¢ mat
ters to occupy all hands, and at sunset
Dan Hook and his party returned,, with
four. days' rations. The Bailor's trip had
proved . uneventful, for_ outside Batonca
territory the natives continued both
friendly and willing to trade.
Profound agitation had. fallen upon
Richard Ogilvle after Vhe. knowledge that
Â¦ his only child, whom he remembered as
an Infant more than twenty years before;
now stood beside him.
Bessie, who had naturally aroused these
deep emotions, did all In her power : to
soothe them. But It proved not easy, and
her* own heart was throbbing at the dis
covery "â¢ that her father yet lived. The
man was In no condition to discuss the
affairs of the expedition that night, and
Roy decided not to Challenge his atten
tion until the following day. .'
"To-morrow we will question him con
cerning the Batoneas and their strength.
To : night we. will" let him delight in his
daughter In peace. . Poor fellow! It was
his likeness to his brother that puzzled
me," said Lord Winston*.
"To think that we have rescued a man
âand this, manâ from death. To think
that Bessie should , have i>een sent as : a
sort of guardian", angel to her own
father!," declared Meldrum, and the other
nodded. . ,:Â¦ . , â¢ , : .-..."
"Pomba said truly at our first metelng
that the world is a mighty small place."
Until near the dawn Bessie talked with
her father, and Meldrum presently Joined
them and listened to the strange Incidents
of Richard Opllvle's eventful life, while
for the rest, Lord Wlnstone, v anticipating
a busy day on the morrow, turned in as
soon as posible.and Fain absented him
self, feeling that he belongeoT'no more to
the united little*- party that had faced so
much and whose anxieties V,and< experi
ences were not yet at an end. ': Now; he
only desired to make a cleahvbreast to
Roy, and cared nothing what; might hap
pen after his confession. '4* \
A day of uneventful peace succeeded
upon these Incidents, a day spent chiefly
In listening to Richard Ogilvie's strange
story of his savage life, but upon the fol
lowing morning, while breakfast was In
progress, considerable numbers of the Ba
toneas began appearing upon the edges
of the adjacent forest They were In war
array and evidently designed a combined
approach if not attack.
Lord* Wlnstone scrutinized them care
fully through his field glasses, then turned
and spoke.
"They look like fighting. 'I'm afraid.
Better call the men to quarters. A good
few of their leaders accompany the force,
as far as I can make out. but I don't see
their riant king among them."
i CHAPTER XXV.
THE BATTLE OP BANGILLO.
But Ogilvle It was who allayed the Im
mediate alarm of M-ldrum and his
friends. Attired in a suit of Tracy Fain's,
the rescued man moved about camp with
wonderiul briskness and spirit, and now
he borrowed Wlnstone' s glasses, but re
turned them again after one glance at
the coming force.
"They don't mean fighting," he said;
"at least, their signals are friendly.
These people are a part of Pomba's army
ânot his. veteransâ but about 600 or 600
of the youneer men. Rather more than
a quarter of the total troops, I should
guess. They are coming to talk, either
with a message from him or on their own
account. Pomba's son. Latossl, Is with
them; so they've probably arrived with
a letter of u.*imatum of some sort.
They're carrying p:x>vislons, too; I can't
understand that."
Presently certain of the chiefs Includ
ing Latossl, approached, and Meldrum
and Winstone, with a bodyguard, and
Richard Ogilvie to Interpret, went out of
camp to meet them. Then the nature of
the visit appeared and news of a re
markable dissension In the councils of
the Batoneas was made public
Utmost discord Indeed prevailed. The
nation was divided against itself, and the
party now awaiting Roy's. word had se
ceded and SDllt from the rest of Pomba's
army, belnsr moved thereto by recent
events and a superstitious convlctlon'that
bnly under the sign of the returned Chln
kakko could Batoneas expect to fight and
conquer. The recent failure of his pro
posed sacrifice had crone far to deepen
an Inner ferment throughout Pomba's
army.
Thanks to Ogilvle and his years of in
struction, something like modern military
order and severity prevailed amid the
Batonca forces, and their training had
showed Itself In many triumphs: but be
fore the shattering advent of the white
Queen and the golden fetich even the
high discipline of these savage regiments
was, not proof.
Efforts had been made by Pomba to
hide his moonlit disasters at the Death
Place, and It was given out on the follow
ing morning by the medicine men that
the familiar spirit had been duly sacri
ficed and that success must now attend
the King; but truth on such a matter
could not be concealed for long.
It became known that under Chlnkak
ko the white â¢ men had rescued Pomba's
familiar from the j death prepared for
him, and this Intelligence confirmed many
in their determination to go over to the
struct him In all that I knew of civiliza
tion. In exchange he allowed me my life,
and I, cur that I have been, clung to the
wretched existence Fate put upon me.
Now, now I begin to hope it was all a
dream, that my hair has not grown gray
in captivity; that my life has not been
running to rot through years "â¢* without
count."
"It is no dr^am; but now you are free.
Tell me one thing and I" will trouble you
no more. Did Pomba owe his lfe to >qu?
Was It you he struck from . behind when
you were about to escape from the Baton
eas T That he did this I khoyr from his
own lips, but I understood from him that
he had slain his master."
"Not so; I am the man. He meant to
kill me and I rolled over and believed as
I felt the steel through my back that all
was ended. But I did not die; I was even
nursed and kept alive that I. might afford
some sport at another time. And then the
king In those days, one M'wenga, went to
war and lost his life,- and Englishmen
were within half a day's march of me and
never knew it!
"Pomba, instead of slaying me, as the
other had proposed, decided that 1 should
live, and proclaimed me his familiar
spirit before the nation. For years, how
many you know better than I,, I.
have dwelt with the Batoneas. Some
times I thought to kill myself, but life is
precious under any circumstances and I
lived on.
"That is the outline of my story. The
details will take long to fill in, but now
relieve my own curiosity a little. Who
are you and how did it' come about you
were hidden at the very spot on which
I was to be brutally murdered? What
can you do In the heart of this cursed
land?"
"I will tell you everything." answered
Roy, "but first one question more. The
precious stones you had hidden â what of
them? Where are they now?" . > .
"My emeralds and rubies and diamonds!
Why, it Is years since I so much as
thought of them. I hid the bulk of them
In an ants' nest beside the Golden Falls.
I was writing a description of my hiding
place when Pomba's knife passed into
my back. That man! I would have trust
ed him with untold goldâ indeed, I did so,
for he had my secret; he knew where th-3
treasure was buried. Now, please God,
I may stand face to face with the fiend
once more â only once more."
"And you heard no more of your treas
ure afterward?" ' .
"Never a word. Sometimes . I specu
lated drearily on the value of It, hidden
in the molderlng ants' nest; and I also
wondered what became of those gems I
had concealed upon my person when I
was struck down, for I remained long
insensible, and after I came to myself
the precious stones were gone." ,
"Pomba could have told you," said
Meldrum, and he proceeded to describe
the Incident of the golden fetich and
the paper it was wrapped in. * .
The white man listened with amaze
ment to the strange sequel . of his own
story; then, when the party finally
reached camp at daybreak, he ate and
drank a little, suffered Winstone to, tend
his ailments, and soon afterward sank
into comfortable repose.-.
Meldrum's adventure, as may. be Im
agined, excited the deepest Interest In
his friends, and a little council was held
among them almost as soon as their res
cued fellow-countryman slept.
"This Incident alters the entire aspect
of Â¦ the position, of course," began Roy.
"I'm sorry for you, Tracy; but, after all
we've done a bigger thing by rescuing a
white man, and one who has suffered so
. much, too â we've done a bigger thing by
saving his life than we should have done
by discovering all the gems in the world."
"Yes; but the gems are his now, not
oursâ that's the point," explained Mel
drum's cousin.
Fain had come near complete recovery
during the past four and twenty hours.
His mind, however, was undergoing a
great change, and the shock of his fail
ure to find the precious stones, together
with his subsequent narrow escape from
a hideous death, had tended, for the time
at any rate, to modify his ambitions, ; if
not his character.
He craved the stones no more. He#
looked back on his past with loathing
and, under present circumstances, a
thought. In his mind before the discov
ery and rescue of the owner of the stones,
ijow returned with tenfold force. He had
already determined to confess to Mel
drum, but the advent of the stranger
made it more difficult, In that the self
conscious and unhappy man feared that
his cousin would read a wrong motive
Into confession at this Juncture.
If Fain bad not explained how he "had
mutilated the document found In M'wen
ga's fetich, the writer of the missive
might himself do so. He would certainly
want to see his manuscript and was like
ly to realize that a part had been cut
off from the rest.
The moment was not opportune for pri
vate conversation with Meldrum, how
ever, and the contrite and smitten sinner
said no more at that time. Wlnstone con
tinued, and his advice appeared sound
enough.
"More we cannot do now, and to beat ,
a retreat before the overwhelming odds
represented by the Batoneas Is only com
mon sense. We know exactly where the
treasure is, and if we work north up
to Tanganyika we shall soon reach mis
sionary settlements and can there refit,
or from there return with a strong party
to the coast. This is not to abandon our
goal altogether. Let Jhis old man grow
better of his ulcers and he will put him
self at the head of anpther expedition
and with his knowledge of the country
and' people, probably achieve his object.
But to try and secure his treasures for
him at present appears to me beyond our
power."
"I'm for waiting- a little myself," de
clared Roy. Then Blackbird, with gTeat
humility, asked to be permitted to speak.
"It dis way, gem'mem. T*lngs Is bery
difficult wif Marse Pomba now, 'cause
ebberyting go wrong wlf him. We near
kill de great man last night, an' we take
his familiar spirit away from him in the
name ob Chlnkakko. So he go back to
his people, an' dey hear dat Chlnkakko
hab conquered again. What dey tink ob
dat. sars? Why, dey begin tink Chinkak
ko's stronger dan Pomba." ' â¢ /
"By Jove, you're right, and I'm wrong!"
said Wlnstone, frankly. "I had not
thought of the significance jof this last
incident. We must wait, certainly. I
hoped great things from the Chinkakko,
after that first interview,- but I'd forgot
ten the thing before this startling de
velopment.* To think that this poor chap
has been living as a savage King's
familiar spirit for all these years! " By
the way, what was his name?"
"Blessed if I asked him." answered
Meldrum. "Shouldn't blame him If he'd
forgotten it. What of his health? Is.
there any chance that he'll pull-through?"
"Every chance. He has suffered a bit
from neglected ailments and lack of prop
er physics; but he has a powerful frame,
and his reserves of strength are by no
means worn out. The marvel to me is
his intellect Is clear and unclouded
through it all. The man's face bothers
me, curiously enough. Haggard and hairy
though It is, his features constantly put
'What is that which .is most precious in
the wide world to you. King PombaT
And I said, 'You, my Familiar Spirit, are
most precious in the wide world to me. 1
Then he said: Take me, then, by night
to the death place and burn me alive, so
that my inner demon shall return to the
stars. Do this, if you love your peopU
more than you lpve yourself. And it shall
happen that you prevail instantly against
the white men and blot thertT from the
land of the living, and regain the guard
ian of the Batoneas. Chtnkakko. the
fetich of cold. And that shall take my
place as your Familiar Spirit, for when
their guardian is restored \ to the tribe
you will want me no more.'
"Thus he spoke, and I obey him. for
love of my people, and make this sreat
sacrifice, that my warriors may stiffen
their knees and find their hearts stout
against their enemy. My black ants shall
travel forth against these white ants ana
devour them altogether, so that there is
not a bone of their white bodies but shall
be ground to powder and flung into the
'It is well," answered one of the old
men; -the Familiar Spirit must be burned
alive, accordlne to the word of his own
mouth. His words were good, but Pomba
has all his wisdom now. and Chlnkakko is
wiser even than the Familiar. Therefore
wo will slay him upon the fire and send
his Inner demon back again toÂ» the
Lord of all Demons. Now bring him
forth and hang him between the pillars
by his hands and his feet and let the
flames slowly lick up his life before the
moon shall depart."
All assented to this proposition, and,
rising, thÂ« aged men walked in proces
sion to the litter and removed its cover-
Meldrum. who had gathered from Ma
brukl the general purport of the speeches
Just recorded, was In two minds whether
to rescue the unhappy wretch who- would
now appear or let him suffer. Discretion
suggested the latter course, and he hoped
that the Familiar Spirit might prove to
be some animal other than humanâ a goat
or crocodile or bird.
But doubt upon the point was very
speedily dispelled, and Meldrum's heart
stood still as he watched a tall figure rise
from the. litter and stand face to face
with Pomba.
"My God!" he cried. 'It's a white man!"
CHAPTER XXIV.
A. DISCOVERY INDEED.
Roy's cry startled the savages, and the
workers hurried round their wise men,
picking up spears and shields as they
came. But the handful of aborigines
proved no match for five armed foes se
curely posted in the darkness and safety
of the wood.
A rescue was, of course, the onÂ© thought
in Meldrum's mind, and now he called to
his men to fire a volley at the Batoneas,
then advance, shouting the war cry that
had been taught that morning.
Roy himself singled out Pomba with
purpose to shoot him, but all was now
movement, and the light of the torches
and the shadows of the night played suet
pranks upon the dark skins of the sav
ages that, even at this short range,
straight shooting proved difficult.
The dangrer of striking the strange fig
ure in their midst also appeared consid
erable. A white man he was without
chest; his bald head glimmered under thÂ«
moonlight; his feet and hands were fast
bound; yet there lacked not- dignity in
his mien; and, upon the cry of Meldrum,
he started, then remained motionless with

"It is the only language I can speak; but

echoing over the- hills. Hlnton heard It
at the same Instantâ evidently some, spe
cial, or perhaps a wildcat engine, was
bearing down upon them. And there was
still bo much trestle before themâ so much
of that Blender network which offered no
places of safety. ]
Looking back be saw the thin line of
Bmoke that marked the speeding deathâ
they could never reach the other side in

The children. In their happy babble,
heard nothing, and Hlnton, forming an
instant plan, said rapidly In French:
"Don't let them know! They will turn
stupid with frightâ and we could not do
anything with them. Obey me and I can
save, you all."
To the mastery ln his eye Miss Wade
yielded ln a sort of blind confidence. He
would save them all, she repeatedâ and
the sick terror at her heart lessened its
strain a little. She heard him laughingly
urge tho children to hurry, heard him of
fering prizes to the one who should pass
the gin first and then taw him snatch up
the fat-legged 6-year-old.
Wrapped ln their' wretchedly slow race,
for they had to move with aome caution,
the children, as .they stood at last above
the gin, did not yet hear the thunderous
monster, now setting, its iron feet on tha
trestle Itself. They only heard Hlnton's
sharp command to "Stop!" and then their
baby faces went white as they aaw him
lean over and drop the i-y ear-old into
what seemed destruction. But Hinton's
steady, athletic arms had not failed him..
Before the astounded child knew what
had happened she was lying on her back
in the unseeded cotton.
With cool and desperate predsion Hln

ON FOURTEEN TRESTLE
from New York. An individual in that
city had got possession of a bank nota
plate, and was printing greenbacks by tha
tens of thousands. Ha was willing that
others should share ln his good luck. Ha
was bo willing that he would sell green
backs for 10 cents on the dollar and war
rant them to pass current anywhere. It
was the old. old green-goods game, and
young Beechman bit
In turn, he became so generous hearted
that he was willing to let Farmer Hurl
burt in on the spec Together they hoped
to raise $500 ln cash, and after soma cor
respondence with the liberal minded man
in New York it was decided that tha wire
fenca man should make a little Journey
and bring back ten for one.
The farmer sold a horse, a cow and
three hogs to make up his Bhara of the
money, and his prospective son-ln-Uw
started for the East Joe and Bosslo had
not quarreled. He had ceased hoeing po
tatoes to dig holes along tha creek and
look for the black stuff that had made so
many men rich. In a sense they ware
waiting for things to turn up.
"Sarah," said tha farmer to hlj wife
after Beechman had departed, "how
would you like to have silk dresses all
the rest of your life?"
"Don't scare a body to death, father."
she replied. "I know you and Harry ara
going to make millions of money, and I'm
so nervous that I break dishes ovary tlma
I clear the table off."
"Bessie," he continued, as he turned to
tha daughter, "how would you Ilka to ride
out in a carriage drawn by four whlta
horses and have bo many diamonds ea
that you shone Ilka tha sun?"
"If Joe finds an oil well ha may buy
me a diamond rfcr.g," she quietly an
swered.
"Don't you keep It up about Joa. Hall
never find no oil wells, or If ha does it
will ba after you ara married and living
in a palace and having forty servants to
wait on you. Me'n your mother have sat
out to get you a feller worth a million
dollars, and when you are receiving the
President of tha United States in your
own castle you'll ba glad you had auca
a father and mother."
A faw days later Bessie sat out to spend
tha afternoon with a neighbor. She had
not been gone above an hour when young;
Beechman returned from his Journey. Ha
carried a tin box under his arm. tha key
thereof ln his pocket and exultation ln
his heart Boon after his arrival tha two
men went to tha barn to count over their
"ten for one." Tha box was unwrapped,
the key inserted, and the packages taken
out to be counted. Then there came an
interval, during which tlma the wire
fenca man and tha farmer looked Into
each other's pala faces and spoke' no
word. The "money" was green ln color,
but that was all. Young Beechman had
been done up, as thousands before had
been done, and had brought back only
blanks.
They were still looting at each other
and licking their dry lips when Joe and
Bessie drove up to the gate. As she en
tered the bouse Joe hitched tha hone and
came out to the barn.
"I just wanted to say," ha quietly ob
served, "that four days ago I found oil
along tha creek, and that this afternoon
Bessie and I went to Justice Jordan and
got married."
In reply Farmer Hurlburt got up and
took young Beechman by the collar and
â¢lammed him up against the fanning mill
and then Jammed him up against the
granary door and then walloped him all
over the floor and then ended by throw-
Ing him outdoors and sending a kick af
ter him. Then ha turned to the newly
made husband and held out his hand and
said:
"Joe Green, there's only one fool m tha
Hurlburt family and that's me. Let's go
In and have some cider and Ids* tha
bride."
"What did you think of as you winged
your way down?" inquired Hlnton" lightly
as they turned toward the walling chorus
of angry infants, who found the sides of
the bin too high to scramble out .
Miss Wade went scarlet 'T thought of
a lot of things!" she murmured.
"Yes," ; said Hlnton politely, but with
the wound she had given him-before they
had set foot on the trestle now reopening.
He had saved herâ for some other man! -
, "I thought especially," stammered Miss
Wade, "of aâ a proverbâ "
"Yes? May I ask the saw?"
"It's aâ that It's a woman's privilege to
change her mind," murmured Miss Wade.
She thought of this as she thought of
many other things in her descent ..to tha
cotton below. The drop was a fearful one
âand it seemed to her that she wassed an
eternity before she touched anything.
Then, like the first of the children, she
lay on her back staring up at the black
mass thundering past above. v Aa it
reached the spot whence she had
been thrown she saw Hlnton, his hands
pointed above his head, leap far out to
ward the center of the stream, heading
as far as possible from the saving cot
ton.
Ignoring the howls of the Indignant
cliildren, who altogether failed to com
prehend the reason for their brusque and
willing flight downward, she scrambled,
out of the bin and ran to the edge of the
shore. Had Hlnton struck one of the
numerous snags abounding In the river?
Would he never rise a sain?
Her screams for aid brought tha few
men at work to her Immediately. One
of them unlocked a little flat boat Wored
to the shore, but as they prepared to push
her off a brown head lifted Itself from- tha
muddy current and Hinton, blowing tha
water from his mouth, clambered up on
the little pier, his face growing radiant
as he saw tha girl unhurt
"Oh, you!" she cried, "you areâ"
She choked.

"Safe as If they had merely been tossed

"Don't feel obliged to say' anything

ically, misconstruing her embarrassment

"You'd never dive twice Into that river

fireman abruptly.

her. What she might strike, where fall.
she did not know. She only knew that
in his steady eyes flamed a hero she had
not dreamed of ln their conventional ac
quaintance.
Young Beechman encouraged the feel-
Ing in both father and mother, and his
lavishness ln buying presents for Bessie
would have carried a less sensible, girl oft
her feet. But when ha began to court ln
earnest she began to draw away, and Joe
Green had nothing to be jealous of. It was
soon discovered, however, that ha had a
fight on hand. The spirit of avarice had
been awakened in the souls of the par
ents, and It was not long before they had
a good deal to say to Bessie and some
thing as well to her lover.
"Look hera, Joe," said Farmer Hurlburt,
who prided himself on his plain speaking,
"I have said that you were one of the
best young fellers ln this county, but you
ain't Just the. match for Bessie. She's
smart and good looking, and one of tho
sort who ought to llva in town and wear
silks and satins. Instead of plodding
away on a farm. I don't want to hurt
your feelings, but I wish you'd look
around for some other irfrL"
"You want her to marry the wire fence
man. I take It?" said Joe, in reply.
"Yes, Joe: I do. He's got money. He's
making more of it He'll be as rich as
Vanderbllt ln ten years more. He offered
to lend me $50 the other day without any
security at all. He's not only ln the wire
fence business, but he's into windmills
and drainpipe and patent farm gates.
He's gomg Into a speculation next week ln
which he will clear three or four thousand
dollars ln no time at all, and mebba I'll
co in with him. You ain't expectln* to
make a dollar extra this year, and soâ"
"I'm looking for oil down along tha
creek." Interrupted Joe.
"Can't be none there. Joe. Can't be no
oil ln this county. I like you as a man.
Joe but being you haven't got money I
shall have to ask you to stay away after
this. It may take your appailte away for
a few days, but you'll ge.t over it ln a
week and shine up to one of Jim Gard
ner's girls."
Bessie was told at the same time that
she would be expected to discourage Joe
and encourage the other one. and though
she promptly rebelled her .parents put tha
foot down In a most vigorous way. In a
manner tha field was left clear for the
wire fence man.
"Unfortunately for him he was a boaster
and a braggart He was making a few
dollars, but could not count on anything
permanent i He realized that if he got the
farmer's daughter at all it would be
through the aid of money, and he began
to plan and scheme.
Circumstances aided him. One day ha
received a private and confidential letter

not a cloud ou tha hort
Â¦on until a young man named Harry
Beechman came into the neighborhood to
sell and to show the farmers bow to set
up wire fencing. He secured board at
Hurlburt's and at once became "stuck"
on Bessie. His admiration naturally
pleased her, and when peopla began to
hint that it was a case of love a new Idea
came Into her father's head. He knew
Joe to be an honest, hard-working young
man, and the question of money had
never come up. If he married Bessie ha
would take her to his own house and pro
vide for her as well as a farmer would be
expected to. It was only after the wire
fence man came and exhibited his "roll"
and talked of stocks and bonds and bank
accounts that Farmer Hurlburt realized
what a good thing It would bo to have a
wealthy son-in-law.

He had forgotten the girl, singing and
churning at the sprlnghouse, but remem
bered her, now noting both sounds had
ceased. He was on the point of calling
to her when he caught a flash of pink on
the farther bank and heard her say with
sparkling malice, "How do you like it,
gettin' caught yourself? Ain't you ready
to cry quits with the big trout?"
"How do you know I caught him?"
Beckley retorted. The girl shrugged her
shoulders the least bit. "I watched you
âto wish you bad luckâ you were so
rude," she cald. And as she said it he
noted that neither accent nor Intonation
was rustic. He looked at her appealUigly.
"I was rudeâ a perfect brute." he said.
"Do please forgive meâ and go fetch
somebody to help me out of this."
"I'll help you out myselfâ on two con
ditions," Jess said, dimpling beautifully.
Beckley bowed meekly. "Only name
them!" he said. "The first Isâ cut your
line." Jess retorted promptly. "The big
trout Is a friend of mine. I've fed him
now and again, ever since we came here."

"A girl! I'llâ be"â Bteva didn't finish
the sentence. He rose and went to tha
window and looked out on tha faint Â«TÂ»y

tinued as if in defense. "I had to do It.
I helped my brother in the station at

âat least work I could do. Then I thought
I would come West, dressed as a man,
and I got this Job, and nowâ now you
know why I've got to go back."
Steve turned and came to tha side of
the girl. "You ain't got to go back, and
you ain't a-goln'â not If I can help It.
I might have known you was a woman,
only I didn't know women had such grit.
Look hera. kidâ I meanâ that is"â
"Jessie was my sister's name," laid tha
girl, with a little laugh.
"Well. I'm rough and I don't deserva
no such gal as you, Jessie, but there's
a heap of men git what they don't de

say you kin telegraph. Well, you sit

telegraphln' for meâ one up the line for
a new ajrent for Lone Dog station and
one to Prairie City for a parson. And tell
'em I give 'cm until to-morrow mornin'
to git here, on the first train," added
Steve Oliver, with emphasis.
Steve shifted uneasily In his chair.
"This here sister of yours," he said at
last, "do you reckon now she'd marry
meâ If I could git to ask her?" he stopped
the boy as he was about to speak. "Just
keep quiet sonny, and let ma bark a
spelL I've been doing a lot of thinkin'
since I come here this evening, and It's
been about her. I'va been drlftln* around

you, getting Into scrapes and out of 'em,

wanted her to help me. That's why I
don't want you to go away, kid, for if
you do I won't git no chance to a** hÂ«r
and ask her. Do you reckon she'd look
at me. kid?"
The boy said nothing for a moment,
while Steve watched him anxiously. Tha
dawn was Just breaking over tha plains
and a pale light came through tha dirty
windows of tha station.
"And run away from nothing. The
boys ain't goln' to do no harm. I'll sea
you don't get messed with too much."
"But when you ain't here what would
happen? Oh. If you hadn't been here to
night. No, there's no way but for ma to
leave."
"I guess not now," . he said, "after
what's happened. I must go away, go
back. I ought never to have coma. I
didn't see it before. Oh. you can't un
derstand," he cried. "I don't want to go.
I haven't any situation, nor money nor
friends." He broke down sobbing again.
The boy gave a Queer little laugh
which changed to a sigh.
"Oh. she? She's living."
There was a long pause. "She's a right
purty gal," said Steve. "I've been study
in* that picture. She certainly fnvors you
a heapâ that is if she has yallei like
yourn. Has she?"
"Yis," returned the boy, "It's Just the
color of mine."
"I repkoned so. Long. I bet, and curly.
I knowed It. What's her name?"
â¢Erâ Jessie."
"Jessie?" Steve pondered over the
name as If to see If It would fit his
preconceived notions. "You'll be having
her on here soon I reckon, won't you?
I'm powerful anxious to come up with
your sister."
It was, on the whole, a good natured
crowd, and Steve was popular, wherefore
It took the hint and Its ponies and depart
ed whooping.
An hour later Steve returned. The
lamp was out and he was about to ride
along when he heard the sound of sobbing
from the dark Interior of the station.
"Holy smoke! They don't breed men
where he comes from, that's sure." said
he. dismounting and going to the door.
HÂ© moved toward the sound and mads
out the boy crouching beside a bench, his
face In his hands. At the jar of heavy
footsteps the boy started, but Steve laid
a kindly hand on his shoulder. "There,
sonny, don't take on like that when there
ain't no reason. The boys was Just play

you'd pulled that triggerâ"
"I'd have. killed him," sobbed the boy,
"If he'd touched me again."
Steve chuckled. "lie was safa enough,
kid. It was the rest of us you had
scared. It was plumb ridiculous."
The boy apparently did not see the
comicality of the situation, for he con
tinued crying softly, while Steve looked
on, powerless to help. A crying man was
something new In his philosophy.
"Look here, kid," he said at last, "why
did you come here, anyway? You're
mighty young- and inexperienced for this
here strenuous life."
"I had to. This was the only place I

"Ain't you got no kin 7"
"They are all dead."
"Your sisterâ she ain't. Is she?"
"My sister? What sister? "What do

In the collar of the boy's vblue shirt as
he spoke, but the boy tore away, sprang
across the room and pulled a pistol. For
a moment It looked as If the comedy
were about to change to tragedy, and
then the boy's arm was knocked up and
the; gun wrenched from his trembling
hand. It was the cowboy who had bought
the picture.
"Tour're too old to play with them

young to get shot." Then he turned to
the others. "I don't know how you feel,

has made a business of handling clay for

amount of time and study.
To be sure, you can't pick it up without

success of it any more than you could

And here the curtain must fall, for the

throne of his father, and Winstone, with
Dan Hook for first assistant and master
of ceremonies, looked to it that the crown
ing ofÂ« the new monarch should be a very
imposing and splendid circumstance.
Then the expedition, after a stay of five
weeks in comparative comfort and idle
ness at Bangillo. started homeward some
five and thirty strong.
But Latossl himself traveled with his

when white men come among the black.
We can never reach their heartsâexcept

"Don't make It worse by talking about
it, old man. The thing's done and we've
bought our crystals With blood instead of
beads. Come to camp, and let us do the
last dismal duty this dismal. day has left
for us. I bid Dan dig their graves to
gether, and dig them deep. Our friends,
I mean."
"Yes: we will see them laid in the eartn
and safe from further tribulations," said
Wlnstone. "Look!" he aaded. "Who
shall declare these people do not share
our common emotions and affections?
There are our campflres ahead and that
twinkling constellation of red stars wind

hillsidesâ what Is it? That sound of wall-

"Yes; that's as much good luck as a

Five and fifty seedpods he dug out, and
in each about twenty to twenty-five dull,
different-colored stones, like coarse gravel
and small pebbles, appeared.
Then, before the mound was laid flat
and the hard, undisturbed earth appeared
beneath it, Roy made a further find, and
discovered the remainder of 'Richard
Ogllvie',s hoard tied up In a large piece of
hide and bound about with many coils of
wire. This contained the richest part of
the treasure, those gems the defunct ex
plorer had designed to carry with him
when Pomba struck him from behind and
shattered his hopes and ambitions.
In the hide stones weighing In all nearly
ten pounds were found, and though many
appeared to be. but coarse lumps of rough
metal, none of the party could appraise
their value, so all were taken. Full five
and twenty pounds the total treasure
weighed, without the seed pods that con
tained the greater part of it.
"The extent of this fortune must remain
a secret until we get home with the Â«t^. M
said Lord Wlnstone. "For Bessie's sake
and yours, old man, I hope it may turn
out the Jeweler's shop we came to find.
Of course, gems and, such things look
rather discouraging in the rough, but we
may say of them what we say of rich old
miserly relations when they pop off, that
we hope they'll cut up well. We must
take it for granted that Richard Ogilvie,
an old and experienced prospector, Tcnew
his business."
the camp was pitched. The men stood
round the bloodstained chamber, end un
der the fitful flicker of torches the ex
plorers flung the bones' from the black
mound and dug In,to It
Thus did the object of the expedition
come to light at last. The spear with
which Meldrum dug soon hit a hard sub
stance, and, burying his hand In the
earth, he brought forth a seed-pod of um
zimbete.. Then his thoughts leaped like
lightning along the strange courses of
past time, and the scene before his mind's
eye was of an ancient room, a little ob
ject on the wall, and the cutting open of a
llonskln packet in the presence of his
cousin.
Still Meldrum's work was far from
completed. A watch had been set over
the mystery house, and thither with
torches and a trusty party of armed Zan
zlbaris, Wlnstone and Roy marched after
Roy obeyed, and presently their dead
king was returned to the Batoncas and
borne with howllngs and lamentations to
his palace, while the natives also carried
Ogilvie outside Bangillo and laid him be
side the other British victims of the day.
Thus poor Bessie's father, suddenly re
stored to her after twenty years, was as
suddenly snatched again Xrom his daugh
ter's love. The awful carnage of the day,
with Fain's death and this crowning trib
ulation, affected the girl very seriously.
But soon Dan Hook arrived, Bessie's tent
was put up, and she hid her grief from
the multitude of strange eyes.'
"Take the girl away," whispered Wln
stone. "Lead her out of -camp and break
it to her gently that her father has lost
his life."
Ogilvie had been stabbed through the
heart, while the dripping knife he still
clutched In his hand had severed the ar
tery in his enemy's neck and inflicted
other fatal wounds.
They lay together, their distorted faces
not a foot apart, and it appeared that
knives had been their weapons, for both
were hideously gashed and slashed. Then
each, as it seemed, had got home a simul
taneous death blow.
In the mystery house, black man and
white had met; but the awful death strug
gle that took place between them could
never be chronicled, for no human eyes
other than their own had witnessed it.
And both were dead. ; , u '*j

hieroglyphic that appeared upon- the
Golden Fetich, and at one corner lay the
broken parts of a broad, leaf-shaped
spear, with which it was evident some
body had been digging in the mound.
Pomba It was who spoke thus, at the
hour of defeat, and conscious that the
hidden treasure of Richard Ogilvie was
the object of the attack, had sped to the
hiding place, doubtless with Intention to
move the precious stones elsewhere and so
make peace on advantageous terms, des
pite his overthrow. But another, equally
anxious to possess his own, had marked
the defeated king's flight and followed
him. *
THE END
Indeed, Tord Wlnstone would take no
denial in this matter, and he wrote big
checks at Zanzibar with a grim deter
mination. Meldrum's Â£10,000 had practi
cally vanished, and the prospect of be
ing the poor husband of a rich wife was
far from pleasant to him. until Bessie
laughed him out of it and seriously in
quired who. was responsible for her for
tune. But that happened upon the pas
sage home and after many sad leave-tak
ings and eternal farewells.
Bunganl absolutely refused to leave his
mistress at all. but as It was felt that
one winter In England would probably
reconcile this child of the sun to his na
tive land, Bessie had her will and the
Kaffir came home with his friends.
The voyage was uneventful and Lord
WInstone's prophecy proved a true one,
for Roy ate his Christmas dinner in Eng
land, and, what is more, ate it in good
company. "Â»
Six weeks later a trading caravan de
parted direct for Zanzibar, and with them
went Meldrum and his force. The Jour
ney, though slow, proved pleasantly de
void of Incident, and early in November
the coast was reached and the Zanzlbarls
wept and embraced each other at sight
oÂ£ their home.
There the faithful servants and sur
vivors of the expedition were left with

southern extremities of Lake Tanganyika;
and there, upon a torrential and stormy
morning at the beginning of another rainy
season, did the King of the Batoncas re
ceive with Joy and utmost reverence the
guardian of his tribe, Chinkako.
So the Golden Fetich returned south

afar took leave of It. not without some
sentiment, and pushed northward to the
great waters of the Tanganyika.
In April they reached their desire and
struck a big settlement, where sundry
German missionaries extended to them a
hearty welcome and opened their blue
eyes at the strange story they brought
from the Inner Darkness.
"We can only help him to pass in
peace," he said. "He will never recover
consciousness. The life is flickering
away fast."
"He died for me," eaid Roy, with a
broken voice. "One had to perish, and I
thought the end was come;' but now I
see what was a mystery at the time. He
leaped from that rock thereâ fifteen good
feet it must beâ leaped between me and
these spears; and took them."
"It was a great death, and forgive me.
I wronged the man in thought often
times," said Iv^rd Winstone.
Meldrum was silent. For one moment
lie remembered the dead man's ravings
during his fever. Then he sank them n
the bottom of his heart and banished
them from his mind forever.
The dead was borne to the valley and a
Cag, that recently had fluttered in the van
of the battle, now covered him. Under the
sign of the Golden Fetich he lay, his
course run, bis good and bad, engraved
en time past, to be added to or altered no
more.
A party of half a dozen men and Dan
Hookâ those who had stood guard over
Bessie and were fresh and unwearied by
battleâ now set off to camp to bring along
tome tents and necessaries; while Mel-
Crum, Latossl and the bulk of their active
force marched Into Bangillo. Bessie
walked witn them and it was soon appar

Boy, Bessie and her Kaffir boy, with half
a hundred of the Batoncas, roamed the
fcillside to eeek for Tracy Fain.
Their first point of search was the ele
vation from which Meldrum. Fain and
their little force had driven the Batoncas.
Anfl beyond this epot there was no need
to lock, for there, where Meldrum's life
had been mysteriously savedâ how. he did
cot knowâ lay Fain, with two mortal
Â¦pear wounds in his body and a broken
leg. He was alive, but quite unconscious,
end it seemed certain that death must be
but a question of minutes.
Wlnstone was signaled and, desisting
from his kindly work among the wounded
end dying, he approached.
Meldrum, Wlnstone and Latossl, order

them to learn the fate of their monarch,
entered the house of mystery together,
and a moment later stood not only before
their goal, but faced the last bloody page
In the red chapter of the day's work.
A fiery sunset threw brilliant light Into
the chamber and revealed at Its center a
curious mound of black earth, in shape
like a grave, but with a wider and flatter
surface. Upon it, fashioned In human

"It Is the secret place of Pomba, where
he speaks with the spirits of the air and

guided them. "The dwelling was erected
at his command when he came to the
throne of the Batoncas, and oftentimes
in the hours of darkness be passed thither

visible beings who speak with kings

The so-called mystery house of Â¦ the
king proved to be a small hut with scar

naked^black earth and having around It
lofty walls of bamboo splashed and
streaked with bright colors.
"He passed from the battle back to his
city," said one; "and he returned not to
his palace, but sought the mystery house
of the high medicine, where It is only
permitted the king of the Batencao to
enter. Thither he fled alone, and, looking
again, I saw another fellowâ a being with
flowing beard, the king's familiar spirit,
who was taken from among us under the
moonlight at the death place by the ser
vants at Chinkakko."
But in Pomba's kraal there was mourn
ing, and his wives and children and aged
servants wept, for the king had not re
turned from the battle and it was believed
tnat he had fallen. Only the venerable
medicine men, who now hurried to pay
homage to the victors, could tell of the
defeated monarch.
Thus did Chinkakko return to the Ba

bitter losses, as the Golden Fetich passed

queen.

_ N extremely Interesting work Is
r\ "The Life and Times of Thomas
f^l Jefferson." from the pen of Thomas
] E. Watson, the Georgian ex-Con
gressman and author of works on
the French Revolution and Napoleon
Bonaparte. Interesting It is not for any
new historical facts set forth, but for the
remarkably controversial attitude which
it takes against all standard writers of
American history. Mr. Watson's book Is
boldly hurled into the camp of contem
porary historians as a deliberate chal
lenge, provoking reply by the very pug
nacity of Its assertions.
"The Life and Times of Thomas Jeffer
son" Is nothing If not belligerent. With
sleeves rolled back to the elbow and pen
hurtling across the page the author has
set himself to avenge all of the calum
nious assertions against Jefferson which
have been made by such historians as
Henry Adams, Woodrow Wilson. William
Eleroy Curtis and Theodore Roosevelt.
He declares that, unfortunately, Ameri
can history has been written by New
Xnglanders alone, and despite the lapse
cf years the venom of the old Federalist
party has so embittered the blood of tha
modern scribes that Jefferson has suf
fered nothing but contumely and oppro
brium at their hands. Stinging personal
rebukes to each of the offenders In turn
are administered unsparingly by the
Georgian writer, and they are admonished
that now Is their time to come forward
and establish by facts the strength of
their disparagements.
Â¦ Because Alexander Hamilton, the Fed
eralist, consistently opposed the political
views of Thomas Jefferson, the first Dem
ocrat, Watson pours forth upon the hon
ored head of the first Secretary of the
Treasury, the vials of his pent-up wrath.
He charges Hamilton with being a pluto
crat, a merciless oppressor of the poor,
an unscrupulous upholder of class privi
leges.
In order to throw his hero with Demo
cratic Ideas more prominently into the
light the author casts a most Stygian
blackness over the principles of the Fed
eralists and the political actions of that
party. He brands Washington's policy
toward England as craven; he declares
that the Federalists' treatment of Â« the
overtures from the French republic was
dastardly, ungrateful and Immediately re
sponsible for the embargo act and conse
quent financial disaster during Jefferson's
administration. He maintains that had
Washington's Cabinet treated Citizen
Oenet fairly there Is no telling how the
United States might have profited by the
wars of Napoleon.
Of the reaction, against the Federalists
and the final triumph of the Republicans,
then so called, with Jefferson, their lead
er. In the Presidential chair, Watson
writes with fairness and careful minute
ness of detail. With great dramatic force
are recounted the details of the hotly
contested election between Jefferson and
Aaron Burr, when the House was called
upon to decide the tie vote of the elec
tors. Watson takes occasion to champion
Burr's discredited reputation by showing,
and with Justice, the sterling qualities of
tha man Â«nd statesman before ho was
tempted. >
Prejudiced though It manifestly may be,
even Incorrect In places. Thomas Watson's
book should be read. It should be read
not as a history, but as one man's strong
opinions about one of the great characters
In - American history. (Appleton & Co.,
New York. Price fl HL)
WATSON COMES
TO THE RESCUE
OF JEFFERSON
FRANK NORRIS
GIVES RULES
FOR THE NOVEL
IT must bÂ« with a compelling sense of
his own unwortftlness that . the aver
age reviewer dares to aDproach the
posthumous volume of Frank Norris'
critical -repays which has been re
printed from liis contributions to various
literary mngazlnee. For In one of his
printed taJks on things literary as. they
are and should not be Norris takes the
occasion to ttrar the veil from the poor
newspaper reviewer and show him to the
world in his true colors as a driven hack
who reviews a column of novels four
feet h'eh In one hour's lime. Since Nor
ris cor. f esses -that be has done the same
thing himseif, the reviewer may lfft his
head -a uifle and uncover his typewriter
with- a- fleeting- aervse" that he is at least
In an honored, profession.
"The Responsibilities of the Novelist"
is a book which, has long been 'needed.
The public needs it; the wou!d-be novel
ist and budding short story writer needs
it. ' It is at once an exposition of the
inner -workings of the craCt and a val
uable guide to the great throng of novel
readers. For the first time a novel. st who
feels that his ov,n success warrants the
assumption has come forward and given
tlit* public -a clear, fair view of what the
novelist is. what are his methods and
what his faults. This volume of essays
could well be tailed a hand book'to the
modem novel and a guide to novel writ
ing. Â¦
Especial Interest attaches Itself to these
essays, for In them we rind Norris' ideals
concerning thÂ«Â» novel if not the key it
telf to the works in fiction which he has
U ft behind him. One has only to take
â¢'McTeasjue." "The Octopus" or' "The
Pit" and see' clearly what was the mo
tive spring which created them. None
the less can 'one see wherein his earlier
works fell short of the standard which
a more mature study of the aims and
ethics of the novel has thus established
in these essays. Nor can one but feel
that first and' a'Bove 'air "else" Norris" was
a tsincore workman who strove to express
in his creations that which he felt to
be true in his own heart. The essavs In
this volume vindicate his earlier crudi
ties in that they demonstrate that they
were genuine strivings after the ideal and
not affectations.
In the essay on "The Responsibilities of
the Novelist" Ncrrls declares that the
novel is the great expression of modern
life as was architecture in the middle
ages and painting in the Renaissance;
that with the pulpit and the press, it Is
one of the three great factors in the !lfe
of the people. With that declaration he
then impos-cs a stern injunction upon the
novel writer of to-dav. '
"How necessary it becomes, then," he
says, "for those who, by the simple art
of writmg. can Jnvade the heart's heart
of thousands, whose novels are received
with such measureless earnestnessâ how
necessary it becomes for those who would
wield such power to use it rightfully. Is
it not expedient to act fairly? Is it not
in heaven's name essential that the people
hear not a lie but the truth?" *
In a vigorous attack upon what he
terms the "tin pot helmet and baggy hose"
style of historical romance, which still
has its vogue in the book marts of to
day, Norris proceeds to tell what he
thinks is not the 'truth. He brands the
pseudo romanticists as 'â¢'business men who
prostitute the. good name of American
literature for a sliding scale of royalties."
He will have none of that In bis. The life
Immediately about us is the thing which
Norris would have the novelist depictâ
the story of the neighbor around the cor
ner. He would* evidently.- prefer a second
McTeague to another of Charles Major's
knight in full bloom. And really who
would not? , .-."' '
After discoursing upon -novels of pur
pose and purposeless novels, Norris pro
ceeds to define what he must have striven
for in "The Octopus" and "The Pit"â the
novel which "proves something, draws
conclusions from a whole congeries of
forces, social tendencies, race Impulses;
devotes Itself not to the study of men.
but of man." This he asserts to be the
Ideal novelâ the teacher of the people.
Certain aspects of American literature
next claim the author's Attention. He
characterizes the so-called popular fiction.
He notes the Introduction of the study of
nature into popular fiction such as In ex
emplified" In "Elizabeth and Her German.
HERE Is no doubt. X Â«oppo*eÂ»
* , tb*t If some one should cet up
â¢ â¢ a voting contest to see who Is
1 the most eminent of living
| American authors, Mr. How
r ells would get away with most
of the coupons," writes a reviewer of
"Letters Home," In the Syracuse Post
Standard. "Whether they read him or not
people know about him and like him, or,
as the expressive phrase goes, 'stand for*
him. I guess the secret of it Is, for one
thing, that every one has a strong faith,
in Mr. Howells' genuineness and Ameri
canism. He does not go to Italy for his
scenes and characters as Marlon Craw
ford does: be does not retreat Into the
past as Mr. Churchill and most of thÂ«
other romance writers do. He deals with
the here and now, with Broadway and
Beacon street, -with Iowa and Central
New York, with the election of Mayor
Low and the trust movement. He han
dles all these familiar, commonplace and
homely things and makes good stories of
themâ no easy task. And with all his
humor and clear insight he preserves a
noble faith In everything that is Ameri
can."

To the care-free, tnanana life of the

In the middle of the night Miss De
borah was dimly conscious of gusts of
Â¦wind and a storm of rain beating against
the house. She remembered that tfie
entry window was wide open, and that
the carpet would get soakea, but she was
too tired to care. A blinding flash of
lightning and an almost ' Instantaneous
peal of thunder ' recalled her sharply to
this world.
"Cowfiip!" she cried. "ThÂ« poor dear
will die of cold!"
Forgetting her fatigue she hastily
flung on her grray-and-whlte flannel
wrapper, and slipping her bare feet into
her rubbers, she seized a couple of old
blankets and started for the front door.
In the entry she paused and gave a hur
ried xlanca at tha umbrella stand. Laura
how are you getting on? It la an awful
night for you to be out Tou ought to
have rheumatic fever or pnetzn&cia as a
sequel to this escapade." * - -
. "I have never done what was expected
of me In my whole life, John, and I am
not likely to begin at my age/* ,
Miss Deborah proved a true prophet
She did not even have a cold as a conse
quesco of her adventtxra. Miss . Letitia
watched her carefully for two or threa
days for symptoms of chills and fever or
grippe.
"I know you are dreadfully disappoint
ed, Letltla."* Miss Deborah observed
briskly. "It is hard you can't have the
comfort of saying: 'I told you' so.* and
'When will you ever learn not to do such
craxy things?* "
**I am thankful you haven't made your
self in. dear."" returned Misa Letltla.
"but 'it was Just as crary a thing for you
to do."
"Well. I don't care. I am as strong as
a horse and there Is no reason why I
should not do craxy things. I mean to do
crazier and , crazier things. Letitia. I
think it is time I had my Cin*. _And I
eccompllshed my object Cowslip"!* get
ting well."
"I have no doubt she would hava got
tmJI in any evtnt," Â»ai<J Miss L^tUlSv,
A terrific peal of thunder drowned tha
close of her remarks, and John plunged
downstairs and out Into the storm, trust
ing to the lightning to guide his steps.
. "How terrible It. would be if onÂ« of them
should be struck," Lucy suggested with a
little shiver, as she crouched down on her
sister's bed. Esther went In to see how
the children and the baby were faxing.
They were peacefully sleeping. It
more than a little thing like a thunder
storm to wake them.
Meanwhile Miss Deborah, having ful
filled her duty in the station In life to
which she had been called, was slowly
making 1 her way homeward. Her. India
rubbers were filled with water, which
gurgled out in cold streams on her bare
feet with every step she took. She was
drenched to- the skin, but It was such
a warm night that she enjoyed It In fact
the. whole adventure was one that ap
pealed to her daring spirit. After two or
three brilliant Cashes of lightning there
was a period of Ethiopian darkness,
through which she struggled toward the
beacon lights of ttÂ»e house. Present^ a
vised Miss Letltla from her room. "The
lantern Is In the china closet cupboard,
the right-hand cupboard on the middle
shelf.". â¢ . :
"I was on!y Joking. I never dreamed
of really borrowing Laura's sacred um
brella. Letltia. do you think I oiipht to
send It back?" Miss Deborah's outbreak
of temper had left her In a chastened
mood. Under these circumstances she
was willing to ask her sister's advice.
"I don't know. What d.d she say,
children?"
"She laughed ard laughed xchen she
heard the cow was sick. I guess she
wouldn't think it was so funny if It was
her cow. And she saidâ what was it she
said, Lily? She was so particular for us
to remember it exactly."
"She said. 'Please give my compliments
to your Aunt Deborah, and tell ker I am
glad she can find such a good use for my
sketching umbrella.' "
"You may as well keep it. as she was
kind enough to send it," LetlU w>
eeled. Bo the umbrella stayed. Miss De
borah and. the children went with it into
the tndosure behind the garden, where
the cow was stretched limply on the
grass. Miss Deborah planted the umbrella
firmly In the ground, and its generou3
shade kept the sun from poor Cowslip's
head.
"There." said Miss Deborah when her
work was accomplished. "I am glad that
umbrella is doing a useful deed for once
In Its life. Children, run In and ask your'
Aunt Letltla to give you the big palm
leaf fan that stands on the up of the
right-hand bookcase in the libraiy. and I
will fan this Door creature: the K:es are
troubling her. And bring out the lit:Ie
camp stool." ,
There was nothing funny to the chil
dren in the p cture their Aunt Deborah
made as she sat oil hex camji stool that
hot forenoon waving her large paim-leaf
fan. and It is safe : to Â«asÂ«xrt that the
humorous sice did not strike Cowslip.
Mis Letltla was amused. when she sallied
out toward 12 o'clock to se how her slater
was faring.
"Deborah, you look too absurd In your
short skirt with that huge fan under that
immense umbrella. You remind me of a
toad under a toadstool. I never saw any
thing so funny in my life." *
"I am glad if ycu are amused."
"I wish you could see yourseif," said
Miss Letltia. and she laughed again. "Per
haps you wculd^like me to send your din
ner to. you?" she added ironically.
"I should like to swear at you, Letitia
Wyatt, that is what I shouid like. You
are enough to drive a saint crary.''
"I did not mean to make. you .ingry. I
never can tell what is going to make you
angry," Letit'a remarked in an injured
tone. "It was merely in fun. You cau
usually see the funny side of things as
well ci any one."
"If you think it is eary to see the fun
ny side of the dangerous illne?s t of your
only cow. when you have been broiiing
like a lobster in her service, i ou can taiia
your turn and try it. I am a little tired
and will give up my place to you wiMng
ly."
"Trank you. The sun always gives me
a headache."
"It is lucky that I am so constituted
that I like the scorching sun."
"Deborah, dear, I am sure you are very
tired. Do leave the cow to herself. A
few flies won't hurt her. You are of more
importance than the cow. If she is gj;ng
to die she will die. and If she is going to
get weir she win get well."
"Good-by. Letitia Wyatt. I hare en-
Joyed your call exceedingly, but L think
you ought not to stay out any loriÂ£Â«r in
the broiling sun."
"Why don't you get Lily and Jack to
fan her?"
"Why don't I get chain lightning to
help me?"
"Deborah, I insist, for your own good,
upon your coming Into the house at
once."
"Letitia, I won't." "
Miss Deborah had been fully Intending
to take a recess, but she was not going
to be ordered In by Letitla.
Miss LetiUa went back and held a fam
ily council. As the result, Lucy came
out presently with a glas3 cf lemonade
and a piece of -sponge cake.
"Xow. Deborah, just let me fan Cow
slip for a few minutes." she coaxed as
her Bister gratefully accepted the prof
fered lunch.
"My, dear, you will get a sunstroke. I
shall not allow It on any account"
"Then. come In with me. When It gets
cooler you can fan her again."
"I am going to fan Cowslip as long aa
I like."
When John came home a little later he
was taken Into Mies Letltia's confidence.
"Your Aunt Deborah has one of her
obstinate fits," she Informed him. "She
wljl stay and fan that cow until she
Crops."
"Aunt Deborah or the cow?"
"It is no Joking matter. It Is preposter
ous; a middle-aged lady, sitting under a
sketching umbrella, fanning a cow and
declaring that she will not be dictated to
by anybody. Try If you can't make her
listen to reason. John."
John obediently went out to the lnclos
ure. "It's a pleasant day, /-ant Debo
rah." he beran blandly.
"Very."
"A trifle warm?" he suggested.
"A trifle,"
"Give me that fan. I want to try tan
ning Cowslip a minute."
She rose from her cams stool and let
him take her place.
"How long have you been oat here?"
he inquired, as be swung the fan briskly
back and forth. 'y * -
"Sixteen years. Judging oy my feelings."
"I thought so. It Is six months since I
cams out"
"Do you think Cowslip Is going to die?/'
Miss Deborah Inquired anxiously.
IT iXWXIS was easy for ICas De
borah to sake a choice, aad aba bad
chosen Cowslip with hardly a sao
mesfa hesitation. Therefor* It TU
cot Leer's advice she wanted, bat
eerely the support cf her admiration.
Cowslip was a pretty Alderney. The only
fault that could be found with bar looks

an Irregular way. which Lucy felt la
â¢tlncdveiy wwuld be very trying to Leti
tia. aad yet it did cct seesn of suSdaat
importance to prevent the purchase.
"When the cow arrived the whole family
went ant to the barn to see her installed,
er.c" John, Esther and the children were
loud in her praises. Miss Letitla looked
at her in a mere critical spirit.
"How airy eews did you tare to

"Three."
"I should think you might have found a
belter looking cne."
"Why, I love that deep fawa color.**
a*J4 Esther.
"The eelor Is all right, but that white
patch on her face drives me wild. It Is
so cne-slded."
"I didn't think about that." said De
borah.
"I rever kr.ew nr.y one with so little
esthetic aer.se as you have," Letltla re
marked plaintively. "I should have

"I haw always heard that Alderneys
Â¦fÂ» more delicate than any other cows,"*
Miss Letitia observed ominously at
brtskfa^t cne morning.
"Look here. Letitia Wyatf said Miss
Deborah. "I trill stand a great deal from
you. but that 1* a little too much. The
next time we have a cow you may chooae

Letitla looked at hÂ«"r lister reproach
fully. Deborahs orcasir.al outbreaks of
temper were one of the chief trials of
her lot. They were so unreasonable, so
unexpected.
"My dear." she said pently. "I was not
criticizing. I w-.s merely stating a fact."
Miss Letitia had never ceased to be
thankful that she had Inherited her
mother's even temper.
"I was a beast." Miss Deborah owned
remorsefully. "I am tired out with tax*
letr about Cowslip. She Is a dear creat

Â¦with such sn<1. reproachful eyes, beg
ring me to <Jo somethinK to help her.
Heaven knows I would spend my life

"Why don't you hoM an umbrella over

"I have been thinking of something of
the kind. The veterinary F^r^eon says
Fh* is too ill to be moved. We can't even
get her into the shade. Patrick has tied

Laura Macau'ey would lend me her
sketching umbrella."
Lily and Jack riashed off In oueet of
Mies Macauley. They were not commis
sioned Xo do so, but thought it well to
take timÂ« by the forelock.
Laura Macauley, cool and self-con
tained, was sitting on her side piazza with
the latest Atlantic Monthly in her hands,
when two breathless, disheveled children
rushed up to her.
"Please, Miss Laura. Aunt Deborah
Â«-ar.ts to borrow your sketching um
br*-l!s." Jack ranted.
"Yr>ur Aunt Deborah wants to borrow
my sketching umbrella?" Mies Macauley
repeated Incredulously. Bhe had never
r.^s-K-lated the fine arts with Miss De
borah Wyatt.
â¢'It !Â» for the cow," Lily explained.
Miss Macauley was under the impression
that somebody wanted to make a sketch
of Miss Deborah's favorite. "Who paints
at your house?" he inquired.
"It Is for the cow." Lily repeated. "She
is pick, and we thought it would be a
poo<5 plan to hold an umbrella over her,
and yours is the biggest in town."
"Did your Aunt Deborah eead you
here?"
â¢*Ehe didn't exactly send us." Lily con
fessed. "She just wished you would lend
feer the umbrella, and so we came for It
to save time."
Miss Maca.u!ey*s sense of humor wu
not of the keenest, but the picture of
Miss Deborah Wyatt. who had always
eeorned the amount of wasted time that
the sketching umbrella represented, being
reduced to abjectly borrow It for her
cow appealed even to her. She threw
back her head ar.d laughed.
"The cow is real rick," said Jack. "I
don't eee why you think It's so funny."
"We've got It, Aunt Deborah." tha
children said a little later, as they thrust
the sketching urabraHa into Miss De
borah's astonished hands.
"My dear children! Who told you \a
gi> for that umbrella?"
""We thought vre would surprise yon,"
THE FU2STDA-Y CALL.
- "I am seldom reasonable \ and only
sweet tempered by accident," John ob
served tranquilly. "Aunt Deborah, how
long do you mean to keep me out here?"
,"I advise you to go In at once."
"1 shan't until you do."
'JSow can I allow myself to be routed
by Letitia ?"
"You are only being routed by me. I
am not patient, and I shall begin to swear
presently; you know you wouldn't like
that" â¢
i "I am not so sure. It would be & relief
to have somebody swear."
They walked amicably back to the
house, John promising to come out again
before dinner to 'give Cowslip another
fanning.
"I was sore' John would make you listen
to reason." Miss Letltla said Serenely,
looking 'up from the book she was read-
Ing In the shaded library.
Ml** Deborah pressed her Ups firmly
Macauley*s sketching - umbrella was
thrust like an unwilling guest in among
the Wyatts' trim silk ones.
"It will spoil the â¢ looks of It." she
said; "but no matter. It li In t good
cause. I shall have to get* her another.
I suppose they are expensive; never
mind. I hope she hasn't any tender as
sociations with it. but if she has they
must go."
Hastily taking the umbrella, she un
locked the door and started for the ln
cleaure. The blinding flashes of light
ning enabled her to find her way. In the
Intervals of darkness she paused occa
sionally to rest. "When Deborah reached
Cowslip at last she draped the blankets
over her and planted the sketching um
brella firmly In the ground. It was large
enough to keep off most of the rain.
"There, poor dear, I have done my lev

Her voice made a gentle acoompanlment

But -with the "American shirt waist

They are buying these collars and wash

Alice Roosevelt Waist
Miss Alice Roosevelt and 'Miss May
Goelet, rival attraction* at all the society
functions, are both wearing .winter shirt
waists. They put them on in the morning
and they put. them on in the; afternoon,
and are whirled around In autos, 'making
lovely pictures of , American girlhood, one
very dark and patrician, the other a me
dium style of beauty with the freshest,
Biveetcst face a girl ever wore.
. It Is a strange freak, this of woman's,
that all her waists must be tubbable. But
once having known the comfort of a dress
that could be taken off and thrown into
the laundry, she cannot be weaned away
from it. And the joy. too, of putting on
a fresh waist, the absolute bliss of but
toning a crlFp, pretty, becoming waist, of
adjusting the wristbands, of clipping a
stud into the collar and of clasping a neat
belt around the middle.
Away upon you, all ye costumes, ye
toilets, ye gowns.and ye modes! The Bhirt
waist Is enthroned- in the heart of the
pretty girl; be she a summer girl or a
winter one; and It 'will take a century
to wrest it from bfcr and out of. her ward

The day of the linen waist baa beta ai
hand for some time, but now It can be
truly said that the nignt Is approaching
for them, for some of the prettiest of the
new shirt waists are Intended for evening
wear alone.
A certain society woman who la not*S
for her pretty linen waists has taken wrÂ»
eral old linen sheets which were family
heirlooms and has converted f them Into
shirt waists. They are of the aort of
linen which can be mads Into drawn
work; and they also take embroidery
beautifully.
One waist she has dyed Into a shad* of
corn color and Is embroidering* It In the
sumach reds. Another waist has been dyed
to a rich biscuit brown and Is to be em
broidered In bunches of wr.lt o and purple,
grapes. You can do a preat deal with an
old linen sheet If it be fine enough to lend
Itself well to the dressmaking scheme.
Miss May Goelet has some charming?
shirt waists, for this young woman runs
to the simple style of dress, which In
cludes waists and skirt and a little Jacket
to slip on over the waist. One of her
latest and prettiest Â«hlrt waists la la a
falnt> green,-, elaborately appllqued with
the^coarsest, heaviest kinds of Irish cro
chet lace.. which ; i3 applied to the goods
and surrounded with raised embroidery.
The raised embroideries are very nice.
Indeed, and are, come of them, very ex
pensive. "They are embroidered over a
little pad. which gives the raised effect.
This kind of embroidery Is easy to those
who know how to do It and la of the sort
which can be learned from those who ma
nipulated the embroidery needle twenty
five or forty years ago. The art of # the
raised embroidery has gone a little out
since then but Is now back In all force.
A very pretty trick can be played upon
the dry goods store by purchasing a shirt
waist of simple stripe. Now, with deft
needle, a little line of embroidery can be
run -between the stripes, and so, with
very little work and no money at all, a
plain shirt waist is converted Into a nice
one. The same trick can be applied to
the faggoted waistâ which Is not difficult
to do. A plain waist Is bought and fag
goted at home until something new and
pretty 1Â» turned out.
The winter shirt waists, which should
be very durable, are, after all. not so
very strons. Waists' we.ar out m their
weakest places, and the openwork, or
hemstitching or faggoting Â«.n nmrvm tÂ«
weaken the waist; and the result Is that
It gtves out along the lines of the open
work. Its days are numbered, once It be
gins to give, and the waist Is gone.
There are wise women who take little
strips of linen and applique them under
neath the faggottlng to strengthen the
goods, and so they manage to give the
garment a very nice, long lease of life.

Of course, there are algreat variety of,"

character 1** lost and 'the pictures appear
to be Just' what they areâ mere poses.
But given a :; -go6d subjectâ ah. that Is
different. Art in, photography then be-.
comes merely a question of good por
traiture. * for tSat reason ~T axxTcohvinced "
that there are^qo models to compare. with
the dainty, <9Â£ver. well-dressed/ highly

living embodiment of all the feminine
arts and graces." She ~is~ worldly" enough '
to lack self-cor.sclousness, and simple
enough to be unaffected;- -.'Acd/best pf^all,'

6he dresses well because it is her^natural
taste, and ehe'has the-, wealth' to gratify
all her whims, Shells correctly dressed
not so much' because^ is the 'fashion, but
because becoming. But what i3 of
most lmp^jjtar.ce.to the photographer Is
the fact'-tbat she is individualâ original.
In th's one essential alone do mere pro
fessional <nt>del may hore tft. equal her.
She '--ppses; not so" much for the sake of
posing as for the simple reason jflhat she' 1
wants some good pictures to giv^t o jher
friends. And her pictures 'are -in vaViably,
wondrously attractive. ' Â¦ .
In. all my experience 'I. have, .-perhaps''
made no picture 'that -has attracted YaWe
widespread attention â¢ than Tthe accompa
nying portrait of Mliq Helen Qave^port,
one of the jpiost prominent society girls
In San Francisco^ ftfid who will be tear-'
ried nest Wednesday at St. Stephen's
Church !n this city to Ross W. Smith of
Lcs Ar-gcles. for which reason her picture
Is doubly interesting. She is the daughter
of a railroad manager, while the prospec
tive j groom is the private secretary of
6*-nalor Clark of the new Salt Lake Rail
road.
But were it not that the picture has
been so universally admired I. should be
loth to use it in this connection, but so
many people asked me about the posing
of the figure and the general charm ot
tLÂ« -attitude that the picture Is particu
larly apropos at this time.
To begin with. Miss Davenport is a veiy
beautiful girl, tall, slender and graceful
to a degree. She Is, moreover, bright and
clever and extremely vivaciousâ all ele
ments that go far toward developing per
fect results In the art of posing. . But I
rray as well say at once that this is Miss
Davcnport'e own pose, assumed quite un
consciously while conversing pleasantly.
rhere was in reality nothing left for the
photographer to do but to take a snap
shot without unnecessary delay. Only a
photographer, indeed, can realize what a
labor it would be to attempt to pose like

make -the best of a bad situation and act

Swimming is. but a matter of skill and

on the veranda rail. Before her, half re
clining lit a steamer chair, was a somber
faced young roan. ,
. The long windows of the dining-room
wÂ«re wide open and the- couple In their
shaded corner could bear the labored
music of the volunteer orchestra, the
shuffling of feet and the deep voice of
Judge Davis calling off the figures in the
Virginia reel.
"If I had suspected your intention I
should have stayed in and danced," she
said petulantly.
The young man made no response.
"You said you wanted to smoke," she
went on.
"I'm smoking," he asserted, and to ver
ify the statement he blew a cloud of
smoke from the cigarette. "Don't be an
gry, Lou," he entreated. "Up to now I've
been behaving beautifully."
"Oh, Indeed!" she remarked. "Perhaps
you've forgotten you've proposed three
times before this week."
"Well," he said, "I didn't propose Tues
day nor yesterday."
"You didn't have a chance." she chuck
led. "I haven't a doubt you Intend now
to make up for lost time."
He leaned forward In the chair; his
face .was very grave. He was a good
looking young man, clean shaven and
very resolute In manner. Just now. as
he faced her, his square Jaw was shut in
determined fashion, and the lines about
his mouth showed he was very much in
earnest.
"This Is the 4th of the month," he said
slowly. - "I shall offer myself to you every
remaining day."
She slipped from the rail and stood be
fore him.
"Philip," she said, "IX I give you a
chance to propose between now and the
first of the month I'll accept you."
"Great Scottl" he cried. "You don't
mean you won't even see me, Lou?"
â¢â¢â¢Your deductions are very Intelligent."
â¢ she laughed.
He was standing before her now. He
drew himself up and his shoulders went
back.
."Very well," he said. "I shall buy the
ring to-morrow."
' "I don't believe there's any . need of
haste." she said, and then, with a hurried
"good night," she slipped Into the house
and left him there alone in the moonlight,
at once strangely downcast and strangely
hopeful.
He was still standing there when Judge
Davis stepped through one of the open
windows en the veranda.
"Hello, Morton," called the Judfe*

Late one afternoon at the begtanlay of

on the top rider of the fence that skirted
the old turnpike. He bad been sitting
there since noon, vainly trying* to formu
late some scheme which would brlnr him
triumphantly into the presence of Louise
Davis lonr enough for him to utter the
words on the end of his tongue.
Down the road came a cloud of du*t.
and presently Louisa herself, %&.:Â»
alone, wheeled past In an automobile.
The next afternoon at the same time.
Morton, from the raspberry shrubs beside
the road saw her aealn speed by. A
third and a fourth afternoon he waited
patiently among the prickly raspberry
bushes and when that fourth afternoon
she went past his hiding place. Morton
rushed to the telegraph oOce and sent the
following:
"Travers: â¢
"Send down the 20 h. p. auto.

Three evenings later. Just at sunset.
Louise Davis uped an automobile along
the cool pine-shaded stretches of the
turnpike. Presently a mighty coughing
and bumpln* behind her caused her to
turn her head. There, rapidly overhaul-

In the touring car. a grim smile on his
face, sat Philip Morton.
She turned her eyes ahead and gave
her automobile full speed, but it was no
match for the heavy touring car, which
overtook her with ease. She looked back
angrily, and by the motion of bis lips
she could see Morton was shouting. Then
he took from the seat beside him a huge
megaphone, and through this he shouted
a proposal which could have been beard
In the n*xt county.
The automobile ahead of him slack
ened, then stopped. Morton brought his
own machine to a standstill, Jumped out
and ran forward.
"You've won I suppose," she said,
looking away from him.
He took her hand and a moment later
the rinjf was slipped on. --V
"I knew I'd need It." he laughed.
She turned her head and looked into his
eyes.

Spooning In public Is- always awfully
bad taste. It doesn't make the slightest
bit of difference whether . It Is called
spooning or flirting or playing or anything
else, the fact remains that when one at
tracts attention by any, unusual conduct
a breach of etiquette has been commit
ted and. the only possible remedy is not
to be found guilty a second time.
Of all trying creatures the girl who is
a "fraid cat'" is the limit. Probably Bhe
hasn't the faintest Idea that 6he is a ter
rible nuisance and when she hangs back
and keeps everybody else from having a
good time Is Just as apt to consider her
actions . as cute and . feminine as any
tMng else.
Don't copy after her, for she Is little

Y=? ""'N-^' NCE upon a time there lived in the town of Fairstake. Ari
i-^^^^^^? zona ' a guy who P ossesscd a combustible disposition, an
I Iscftjl^W ingrowing affectirn for booze and a perfect contempt for
'[fflp^^a'Sr municipal tranquillity and the criminal code. His nan*
J W^ftpkJfA was Hank Barlow. " '
m.'^^v^^y' Hank put i n mOS t of his time absorbing firewater and
UsS^^tai supplying the town with a brand of excitement which
kept the Coroner working overtime and made the ;ocal
"Death Column" look like an itemized account of a Macedonian massacre
When Hank had practically exhausted the supply of voters in Fairstake
the Governor came to the conclusion that he was carrying the joke too far,
so he offered a reward of five thousand good and lawful simoleons for one
Hank Barlow, on hoof or 'dressed, f. o. b: Fairstake.
No. one seemed to be in pressing need of that amount of money; at
least* they showed no signs of it if they did, so Hank pursued the even tenor
of his way. . . - . '
One morning when the villagers backed up against the east side of the
General Store to 'thaw out in the young sunshine and talk over the latest
news from Washington and the Chicago Stock Yards, it was discovered that
Hank had been shy for six days. Then like a flash it dawned upon the mem
bers of the Out Door Session that there had not been a murder in town for
nigh on to a week. All of which went to prove that something powerful
was ailing Hank. *
After debating the question at great length it was resolved that:
"Whereas, It has come to be known to the citizens of the town of Fair
stake, in the County of Yuma, in the Territory of Arizona, that their hon
ored and esteemed fellow-citizen, Hankodorous Barlow, has not appeared
upon the streets and thoroughfares of the said metropolis for a period of
six days; and
"Whereas, It is known to the said citizens of the said town of Fairstake,
in the said County of Yuma, in the said Territory of Arizona, that it is not
the custom, habit or practice of the said honored and esteemed Hankodor
ous Hank to absent himself from the said streets and thoroughfares of said
metropolis for such an extended period; and
"Whereas, It is a matter of official record that there has not been a
single death, by violence, in the said town of Fairstake during the week end
ing Saturday, October the thirty-first; and
"Whereas, It is the belief of each and every citizen of the said town of
Fairstake that some great misfortune has befallen the said honored and es
teemed .Hankodorous Barlow: now, therefore, be it
"Resolved, That at committee of three law-abiding citizens, consisting of
Parson Hiram Merriwell. Deacon Calvin Pennybaker and Doc Jordan,
shall proceed in the most orderly and friendly manner to the house of the
said honored and esteemed Hankodorous Barlow and ascertain by the most
gentle and polite interrogating the true cause cf the city's sad bereavement
and report the same to the citizens in waiting."
Vested with the aforementioned paragraphs of official authority and an
elegant sufficiency of Buck-ague, the committee humbly approached the
house of the honored and esteemed citizen. Hank was found seated upon the
back steps with his face between his hands and a sad. far-away expression in
his eyes. He was a changed man.
I - After an exchange of hellos. Parson Merriwell gently placed his hand
upon the shoulder of the honored and esteemed citizen and said: "Brother

HOW THE BAD BOY
CAN BE MANAGED
And tne President.
There now remains to be considered the influence of President Roose
velt upon the American people. An American President is unlike a Euro
pean monarch in this above all else, that he is not born to high office. In
his youth he is unknown. It is not until he is a mature man that he sud
denly looms as. the most conspicuous of all citizens before the eves of his
fellows. His term of office is short, even if it be renewed. There is not
so much time nor opportunity for the personal factor to make itself fe't.
Nevertheless President Roosevelt's strenuous cult of* strenuousness can
hardly fail to have a profound influence upon the impressionable nation . with
which he has to deal. Strenuousness is no new product of the United
States. Mr. Roosevelt neither invented it nor revised it. It was first
planted in America when the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Boston, and it has
been fostered by circumstances and nurtured by the climate ever since. But
of late years the immense accumulation of wealth in the States and the
growth of luxurious habits among the well-to-do citizens have brought into
clear relief the_ need of some of those sermons which the President has been
preaching to his countrymen. The need is even more urgent in this country
than it is in the United States. Our youth is much more disposed not to
be strenuous than the youth of America. The knack of taking things easy,
and of endeavoring to get through the day with the minimum of exertion,
is cultivated much more diligently here than it is in the States. And it is
probable,, just because we need a President Roosevelt more , than do our
American kinfolk, that we do not get him. He is the one growth of the
same conditions which make American business men so much keener than
the business men of Britain, and which' lead tuition by correspondence to be
a flourishing business in the United States, whereas here no one seems to
take the trouble to learn.
â¢ (Copyright in the United States of America by D. T. PIERCE.)
Suppose we test the personal influence of the three monarchs bv asking
what action each of them would have taken had they suddenly been con
fronted with such handwriting on the wail as the report of the Roval Com
mission on the way in which the military and political authorities prepared
for war in South Africa. Is it too much to say that if either the Kaiser o<
the President had been in the King s shoes, the men who were responsible
for launching the. King's army, all unequipped and unprepared, against the
Boers, would have been brought sharply to book? The army, be it â¢ remem
bered, is the King's army. In choosing and dismissing his advisers the King
has a wide liberty of action. No one doubts the keen interest which h's
Majesty takes in the welfare of his troops. In this very matter of the Boer
war, the King â then Prince of Wales â expressed to me his grave misgiv
ings as to whether Sir Redvers Bullcr would find the force at his disposal
adequate to the task before it. This was within an'hour of General Buller's
departure from Waterloo, at a time when his Ministers were incined to re
gard every one as a traitor or a pro-Boer who was not certain that General
Bullcr and his great armv would "steim-roller" the republics before Christ
mas. The report of, the Roval Commission more than confirms all the pres
cient misgivings of the King. Now what will he do about it?
If it is replied that he can do nothing, those who make that replv speak
in ignorance of the immense influence which the sovereign can wield in our
constitutional monarchy. If the Kaiser were the King how much longer
would Lord Landsdowne be Foreign Minister? Would Mr. Chamberlain,
who declared at the very moment he was leading the nation into war that no
reinforcements were needed, escape with merely a royal wigging. I trow
not. But the Kaiser is not our King, and his Majesty is at M^rienbad. and
no one expects that so easy-going a good fellow as Edward VII will bestir
himself to bring the culprits to book. And so far the influence of the sov
ereign will operate for evil and not for good.
A Transposition.
sidering is not so much what can be done by the power of the sovereign
as what can be effected bv' his influence. The German, it is true, took to
twisting the- ends of his mustaches upward to his eyebrows when the Kaiser
set that fashion. But the Germans show little trace of the Kaiser's influence
in weightier things. He is mercurial. 'impulsive) 'meddlesome and dogmatic,
They shrug their shoulders when they read his. speeches, and resent his readi
ness to play'the part of . the Admirable Crichto^ on all and every occasion.
And the Social Democratic vote goes up by 'million after million as the an
swer of the German nation, to the- rhetoric: qf ; the Kaiser. v _
When all this is said there is no gainsaying the fact that the Kaiser has
set or rather has confirmed the fashion in many things both political and
social. He has played to his German gallery;" and it has responded to his
appear. He has set the Germans an example of versatility, of energy, of pas
sionate patriotism, from which they can hardly fail to profit. We could best
realize what influence is actually wielded by sovereigns over subiects of we
could imagine that one fine day the Kaiser and the King changed places. I
will say nothing about the effect which Edward VII might have in Germany.
But imagine what an enormous stimulus to serious and strenuous living,
what an immense discouragement to inefficiency of all kinds, we should re
ceive, if the Kaiser were our King for twelve, months only. I am not sure,
all things being considered, that such a temporary exchange of monarchs
would not be the veYy best conceivable thing that could happen, both for
Germany and for Britain.
Next let us turn to the Kaiser. Is that brilliant, strenuous, irresponsible
genius shaping the German man anew in his own image? I doubt it.
Prince Bismarck rather than Kaiser William is the. type of the modern Ger
man. That the Kaiser exercises a constant and on the whole a very useful
influence upon the administration and the policy of the German empire is
true. But not the wrrole strength of his authority, exercised without stint
for three years, could make a single German " dissemble his ' whole-hearted
detestation of our South African war. He has forced the navy scheme
through, and he has seized Foochow, two acts which may profoundly in
fluence Germany in the future. But that has been done by the exercise of
his authority in the sphere of state action, whereas what we arc now con-
The Kaiser.
Let us then glance in turn at the three most conspicuous rulers of our
time â the King, the Kaiser and the President â how far are they influencing
the peoples of Britain, Germany and the United States? Take our King
first. Is his influence potent for good or for evil? There is no doubt about
the fact that his influence tells. In society, for instance, the King more or
less sets the tone. He can discourage, he can encourage. But even in so
ciety, although he has spared neither example nor interest, he has not made
the rich Jew popular. It may be said that but for his influence the anti-
Semitic tendency of our time would have broken out with violence nearer
home than Paris or Vienna. If true, that must be put down to the good.
On the other hand his influence has told â in society again â in favor of a re
laxation of the standard set up by f his mother. He is what is called a free
liver. He enjoys cards, and the turf, and enjoys himself in the society of
pretty, witty and good-natured women. He has always favored this kind of
life. So far as his influence extends it tells against Puritanism. But it
would be wrong to credit or debit him with the sdf-indulgent temper and
looser morals of a generation that invented Mafficking. The influence of any
of our daily papers is more potent to spread the plague of., betting among
the people than all the visits of the King to Newmarket. In political matters
the King is not supposed to intermeddle. But there is no question that he
and his mother before him steadily and successfully strove to promote the
growth of a more friendly feeling between Great Britain and the American
republic The King has been less successful â for in this matter his influence
was largely counteracted by hjs mother â in opposing the frenzy. *of Russo
phobia. When he was still Prince of Wales he administered a cutting reb'uke
to Mr. Chamberlain for his "long spoon" brutality, and in times of crises the
Marlborough House influence was almost always in favor of a reasonable
policy in the Near or in the Far East. His recent visit to Paris has borne
immediate fruit. He set the fashion of being civil to France, and even
those who had been blatantly rude to our brilliant neighbors became pane
gyrists of the French republic. We have, however, to witness the applica
tion of the most crucial test. The King has just returned from Ireland,
where he set a brilliant and much needed example of being uniformly civil to
every Irishman and to every Catholic whom he met. Will his example be
imitated by the majority of Englishmen? We shall see.

''* /yJoJvcv K cr3t - e stands equally supremely conspicuous: visible by
LaMvigsTTiriifl * Jl the entire nations as no other mortal is visible, and if
there is anything in the force of constantly repeated sug
gestion, then it is impossible for any ruler to fail to influence, consciously
oi unconsciously, the imitative human herd. But this influence may easily
be exaggerated. The omnipresent crucifix in the courts of law in Catholic
countries often fails to succeed in suggesting the ideas of pity and compas
sion to the Judges who administer justice 1 - in its shadow. Sometimes the ex
ample of- the sovereign provokes the subjects not to imitate him but to defy
him. In our own history we have two signal illustrations' of the different
way in which sovereigns and subjects sometimes influence each other.
Charles I set before his subiects the example of a High Churchman of de
spotic tendencies. Instead of imitating him, they rose in rebellion against
him and cut off his head. But when the second Charles came to the throne
and set an example of license and imnotality he found his subjects, quick
to walk in his footsteps. In like manner the unfortunate Louis who lost his
head on the guillotine failed to suggest to a nation pregnant with the great
Revolution the respectable commonplace qualities of their sovereign. Hence
it is impossible to generalize with any confidence as to the effect which the
virtues or vices, the qualities and the defects of any ruler may have upon
those over whom he reigns or rules. Probably they act and react upon each
other, but both alike owe their distinctive characteristics to causes which
long precede the accession of the sovereign. He and they are the chil
dren of their generation. He may be the King Poppy in a field of poppies,
but it would be absurd to attribute to hfs example the color or the form of
the other poppies which grow side by side with him in the same field. No
doubt it sometimes happens, as was the case with' Peter the Great of Rus
sia, a ruler is born who is as much in advance of his generation and ideas as
he is superior to the average man in genius and resolution. But such men
are ra r e. .
Let it be acknowledged, then, that while most of those said to be de
praved are not really so. vet some do show most vicious tendencies. What
shall be done with these? Though a very hard question to answer, it may be
a solution can be found. It is, indeed, a difficult problem. Especially diffi
cult, because what will applv in one case may not be of special value in an
other. Each boy must be studied carefully, and the general principles ap
plied in the light of the information gained by most careful study of the par
ticular boy's peculiarities. See to it that you understand his nature, character
and temperament. Locate his particular weakness. Strive to find their
cause, and, if possible, remove them.-
A change of environment, of companions, and of methods of manage
ment, will often cause such a change in the boy's nature as to astonish
those most interested in him. In many cases it will result in reclaiming
those who have already been given up as hopeless cases.
If the ideals are low. strive to raise them. Some ideals he will have
See to it that they are the best possible. This may be done by talks and by
placing the right kind of books in his hands.
Study closely his likes and dislikes; also his companions and his reading,
than which nothing is more important. See to it that he is in good com
pany at all times, but especially after dark. Recently I met a young clerk in
a lawyer s office. Less than a year ago his mother pleaded with me for the
third time to help her have him sent to the reform school. I refused, and
said, You can save C if you will keep him off the streets at night."
She did so, and the boy was saved. The parent who permits a boy or girl
to run the streets after dark should be dealt with by the law.
From what has been said it is hoped the reader will allow that no boy
is altogether bad. No matter how sure one may be that such is the case,
it is probably a mistake. Somewhere in each boy's nature there is a hidden
germ of manhood. Find^t. Having found 'it. stimulate it into healthy
growth," and you will have saved vour boy from a life of shame and vour
soul from endless anguish.
.The sympathetic soul that can discover and develop what is best in one
of these boys has a high mission in life. It may take much patience, love,
knowledge and wisdom, but he can be saved.

are probably not even so nearly good as their parents were at the same age.
Forgetful of our own shortcomings of the present and past, we are too apt
to look for the development of a higher sense than we have any right to ex
pect. These boys must pass through all the stages through which the race
has passed. First the savage, then the half-civilized, and after that the civ
ilized and enlightened stages. All pass more rapidly through these stages
than did the race; yet vou have no right to expect any great amount of
goodness from any child. The eerms are there, but it takes time for their
development
Though they'may seem to be. few, if any, boys are naturally depraved.
Careful examination will convince all that what seems to be natural has. in
reality, been acquired through imitation. There would probably be no
hoodlums among the 'bovs if there were none to be found among the men.
Even the very bad boy is vicious only upon the surface. His toughness is
only skin deep. The utter disregard for the rights of others, the insolence,
the profanity, are mere imitations of the actions, the manners, the language
and the vices of some swaggering bully who, for the time being, is the
boy's ideal. Be assured that the boy is not saturated with the poison, as in
the case of the men. The bov is simply inoculated. With him. as with the
growing body, it is easily possible to throw off the poison, if only proper
steps are taken to secure the much desired end.
Expecting Too Mtacn of Boys.
rcrg -*Â£~Z& HAT shall be done with the bad boy? How shall he be
I^Bf^iStrfli^'J ' mana Ked? Is it possible to save him? These are questions
lvÂ«ftSJwKJi? Â¦ which are old but ever new. They constantly demand
'4 1 ra-frrar #i^ 3 answers from many loving parents. Let us be honest
about the matter. Is he really bad? It i3 very much to
rif^W^Wl^) ll c doubted. Years of experience with many thousands
\JkÂ±Mpiii&maÂ§r3fi of boys and girls convince the writer that ninety-five
t out of every hundred who are said to be bad should not
be condemned by the use of any such word.
Very often a boy is condemned because he is blessed with too much life
and energy. It boils over and produces "the noisiest boy you ever saw."
Too many parents do not understand the truth of the statement that "boys
must be boys, with their racket and noise."
1 Many times a boy is criticized because he is mischievous. This is no
crime.' Why should he J>e condemned for this? How many can point to a
successful man who, as a boy. was not often in mischief?
Some are condemned because they are not respectful, or because thev
at times are impudent. This. is a great fault; it should be corrected. It is
frequently the result of improper "training, for which the parent is responsi
ble. It is important that the parents find some way to train them awav
from the habits already forrned.' It is also hoped that they will be fair and
not blame it all on the boy. x
Others are said to be bad because they do not tell the truth. Others
because they sometimes take what does not belong to them. Others because
they tease. Others because thev sometimes get into a fight. For these and
other reasons we are only too ready to condemn boys and decide that they
are bad.

INFLUENCE OF MON
ARCHS ON SUBJECTS
Women in Love Not Good Teachers.
/ Â£ 1 MUST support the general rule laid down in our by-laws," said Dr. W.
I H. Maxwell, superintendent of the Public Schools of Greater New
X York. "It is not a matter of discipline with me: I indorse the rule be
:ause I believe in it. Women teachers must resign upon their marriage.
If the husband dies, deserts the wife or becomes incapacitated through illness
or accident from supporting his family, the wife may, three years after such,
conditions arise, and upon furnishing sufficient proof of the facts, be con
sidered for a position as teacher. This is the only recognized exception to
the general rule, and we have found it to furnish the basis of a good work
ing plan. Â¦- . .
"When a woman makes uo her mind to marry her thoughts are centered
on her home-and husband. If they were not she would be lacking in some
respects, and we would not care to have such a woman as a teacher. She
forms ties that bind her more closely than any cold allegiance to employ
ers who pay her a stipulated salary. Her whole life should be in -he? little
domestic circle if she is to make a success of marriage. f
"Her position is fundamentally different from the man teacher s. He
ha* to take an interest in his school work in order to succeed and thus make
it possible to support his family. He may have worries, but they are not of
that intimately domestic nature which characterize the home life of the
wife.- To a large extent he can solve all puzzling problems by making a
success of teaching and obtaining advancement thereby. He can be a model
husband by so doing, as he will not be open to the charge of neglecting
his family. His work lies outside. The wife would have to neglect her
family if she put her whole heart into teaching. It would make her discon
tented with her work in the schools if she appreciated that she was not doing
her full duty to her family. .
"Most women teachers who marry are young or may be classed as such.
Young women who are mothers or who are liable to become such do not
make good teachers. This is, putting the matter frankly, and it is one of the*
main reasons for our objection, to teachers continuing with their work after
they marry. We must insist on teachers doing their whole dutv bv their
work, not giving it a half-hearted allegiance. If a woman is the right sort
she will prefer devoting her whole time to her home and husband.
"We insist upon the rule, but not as a barrier between our teachers and
marriage. We. do not care to interfere, with what they consider their happi
ness. But we must protect the interests intrusted to' us, and we believe
those interests would suffer if the distraction of the marriage tie divided
time and attention with the classroom.
"Our most efficient teachers arc women who have passed the age when
Cupid's blandishments are appealing to them. I do not mean to state that
attractive young women do not make good teachers. The point I wish to ;
make is this: The fewer distractions a woman has the" better her work.
The bounding energy of youth, with its enthusiasm and ambition, .counts
for less than sobriety of viewpoint, experience and the wisdom imparted by
experience. Those whose lives lie largely behind them are not wanted in
many walks of life. They are not considered sufficiently energetic. But the
born teacher has a love for her work amounting to inspiration, and it is
not dulled by the passing years. Some of these women have been married
and they make good teachers, but the delirium of youthful love at least has
passed and their responsibilities have sobered them."

order as soon as vowa are taken at the altar.
Carefully complied statistics go to show that members of the teaching
fraternity may be depended upon for only about elevÂ«n years of service on
the _ average. Although these figures constitute an admirable answer to
those alarmists who profess a fear of race suicide, they also cause concern
to educators. Many authorities regard eleven years as little more than ' a
novitiate for- the work of Instructing the young.
The fact that men teachers are .urged to marry and women teachers are
practically barred from so doing seems to be another Instance of the in
equality of the sexes. The query arises:
Why this distinction between. the sexes?
Why should matrimony disqualify girls for continuing in their profes- '

Y y divide this question into three sections, as follows:
"No. Iâ Should women teachers marry? Yes. by all means.
Let them many the minute they find the man they think they can love all
their lives, and who. they are certain, loves them and will make them happv.
No Board of Education has a right to interfere with the happiness of either
man or woman, and certainly not with that of woman.
"No. aâ Should women teachers continue to teach after they marrv? No;
and the 'no' should be as emphatic as the 'yes* in reply to the first question.
They should stay at home and take care of their husbands and the children
after they come. â¢
"No. 3 There are possibly some exceptions. Some women can ride
more than one horse at a time. They can nurse a baby and teach school and
write for the newspapers all at once, but these creatures are rare. Neverthe
less, there are some of this kind, and it is in their behalf I make the excep
tion.
"There may be a No. 4. but it hasn't occurred to me up to the present
time. No; the rule is not made to discriminate against women. Men are
likely to have outside occupations that interfere with their efficiency as teach
ers. If these duties cause them to neglect their school work or are of such
a nature that they are liable to do so. we do not hesitate to ask for their
resignation. But marriage per se does not impair a man's usefulness as a
teacher. He docs not have to bake the bread and take care of the house if
he is entitled to wear trousers."
1SEE no particular reason why mar
ried women should not act as
teachers. All other business
women are permitted to marry and

right down to it, the School Depart

THE SUNDAY CALL.
Married Women Should Not Teach.
CfCTpf HERE are some occupations a woman might follow even if she
I should be married." said Miss Evangeline Whitney. Superinten-
I dent of Vacation Schools and Playground of New York. "Teaching
' i is not one of them. A bride might keep on with her work as sten
ographer, clerk or bookkeeper. The work may be arduous, but it is. to a
certain extent^ mechanical, and does not require the initiative demanded of
the teacher.
"But why should a woman become a wife and go on teaching? Where
is the home she expected to make for her husband? I fear she could not
display much enthusiasm as a teacher and then be as devoted a wife as her
husband would wish. Some women have a heart big enough for their hus
band and their pupils, but in many cases â most, in factâ one or the other
would suffer. The school authorities have determined the pupils shall not
suffer, and as they have no iurisdiction over the husband they expect him to
look out for himself.
"Married women often make excellent teachers, but these paragons do
not come' under 'the category of fluttering young ladies who have been teach
ing two or three years and suddenly fall a victim to Cupid. Those whose
children are no longer a care, but nevertheless entail a sobering responsibil
ity, may be trusted to do their work to the full extent of their powers. The
rule that applies in this "case never would have been formulated if it had not
been intended to remedy conditions that were harmful to the public school
system. It works well, seldom does anybody an injustice, and. like all good
rules, it can be broken when necessary."
1 BELIEVE the rule which declare*
the position of any lady teacher
vacant upon her marriage to be a
very good one. The^ occupation of
a wife is sufficient in itself â¢ to re
quire her entire time and attention, and
any other employment must of necessity
destroy her natural interest in a home
and its accompaniments.
The teacher, male or female, should
give his or her undivided attention to
their pupils. The best results, both for
advancement of. teacher and pupil, â¢ can
only be attained by this application.
; In Federal positions in the City of
Washington many married clerks work
side by side through their natural lives,
but add nothing to the population of
our country or to the home life or cul
ture of our race; and such unions
should be discouraged.
The profession, however, is always
open, and affords a very proper shelter
to the teacher who has lost her husband
through death or unfortunate marriage.

was fluns like a drawbar through the

clumsy shoe, Jerked his foot from it and
thrown him bodily into the clear.
Chris staggered, panting, to his feet
Already the steel was moving slowly over
the switch; a lantern, burning yet, lay on
its side near the standâ It was Shockley's
lamp. 'Chris looked wildly around for his
yardmaster; called out; called Shockley's
name; listened. No scream, no groan, no
cry, no answer; no sound, but Just the
steady pounding of the wheels over the
contact. The little switchman screamed
again in a frenzy, and, , turning, raced,
stumbling, up the track to the cab. He
swung into it, and by signs made the en
gineer shut off. He tried to talk, and
only stammered a lingo of switch pidgin
and the name of Shockley. They couldn't
understand it at all. but they shut off
with faces pinched and sallow, threw
open the- furnace door, and, grabbing
their lanterns, ran back. The fireman, on
his knees, held his lamp out under the
flat that spanned the contact; he drew,
shrinking, back, and, rising, started on
the run for th'e depot to rouse Callahan.
It was Callahan who pulled the pin a

between Shockley and the cowboys. Even
Peg Leg Reynolds let him alone. "HÂ«'s
the luckiest fellow on earth," remarked
Callahan one day at McCloud, in reply to
a question from Bucks.
"He wasn't always lucky," commented
Bucks. "He came from Chicago. He was
switching there on the 'Q' at the time of
the stockyards riots. Shockley used to
drink like a pirate. I never knew Just
the right of It. I understand It was a
brawlâ anyway, he killed a man there;
Bhot him, and had to get away In a hurry.
I was trainmaster. Shockley was a
striker; but I'd always found him decent,
and when his wife came to me about it
I helped her out a little; she's dead since.
His record isn't Just right back there yet.
There's something about the shooting
hanging over him. I never set eyes on
the fellow again till he struck me for- a
Job at McCloud; then I sent him up to
you. He claimed he'd quit drinkingâ
guess he had. Long as he's behaving
himself I believe In giving him a chance
â h'm?"
It really wasn't any longer a case of
giving him a chance; rather of whether
they could get on without him. When the
Colorado Pacific began racing us Into
Denver that summer It began to crowd
even Shockley to keep the yard clean.
"Chris, what do they give you for tin
kering up the ties?" asked Shockley one
day.
"Dollar an* a half."
"Why don't you take hold switching
with me and get three dollars?"
Chris was thunderstruck. First he said
Callahan wouldn't let him, but Shockley
"guessed yes." Then Chris figured. To
save the last of the hundred dollars nec
essary to get the woman nnd the babies
over â it could be done in thre months in
stead of six. If only Callahan would lis
ten. But when Shockley talked Callahan
always listened, and when he asked for
a new switchman he got him. And Chris
got his three; to him a sum unspeakable.
B3' the time the woman and the children
arrived In the fall Chris would have died
for Shockley.
One stormy night, when Chris thought
it was perfectly safe to venture up to
Rubedo's after groceries, the cowboys
caught him and dragged him over to Pat
Barlle's. It was 7 when they caught him
and by 9 they had put him through every
pace that civilization could suggest. Peg
Leg Reynolds, as always, master of cer
emonies, then ordered him tied to the
stove. The fur on Chris's coat had al
ready begun to sizzle when the front door
opened. Shockley walked in.
Straight, In his ambling, hurried way,
he walked past the deserted bar through
the ring of cowboys at the rear to Chris
frying against the stove and began cut
ting him loose. Through every knot that
his knife silt he sent a very loud and very
bad word, and no sooner had he freed
Chris than he Jerked him by the collar,
as if quarreling with him, toward the
back door, which was handy, and before
the cowboys got wind he had shoved him
through it.
"Hold on there!" cried Teg Leg Rey
nolds, when It was Just too late. Chris
was out of it and Shockley turned alone.
"All right, partner; what is U?" he
asked amiably.
"You've got a ripping nerve."
"I know It."
"What's vour name?"
"Shockley."
"Can you dance?"
"No."
It was Peg Leg's opportunity. He drew
his gun. "I reckon maybe you can. Try
it." he added. And a bullet from the
cowboy's gun splintered the baseboard at
Shockley's feet.
Peg Leg was a rough dancing master,
and before he eald enough an ordinary
man would have dropped exhausted.
Shockley, breathing a good bit quicker,
only steadied himself against the bar.
"Take off your hat before gentlemen,"
cried the cowboy. Shockley hesitated, but
.he did pull off his cap.
"That's more like it. What's your
name?"
"Shockley."
"Shockley!" exchoed Reynolds, with a
burst of range amenities. "Well, Shock
ley, you can't help your name. Drink for
once In your life with a man of breeding
âmy name's Reynolds. Pat, set out the
good bottle â this guy pays," exclaimed
Peg Leg. wheeling; to the- bar.
"What'll it be?" asked Pat Barlle of
Ehockley, as he deftly slid a row of
glasses in front of the men of breeding.
"Ginger ale for me." suggested Shock
ley mildly. The cowboys put up a single
yell. Ginger ale! It was too funny.'
Reynolds, choking with contempt, point
ed to the yardmaBter's glass. "Fill it
with whisky!" he shouted. The yard
master held out the glass and the bar
keeper began to pour. Shockley looked
at the liquor a moment: then he looked
at Reynolds, who fronted him gun In one
hand and red water in the other.
"Drink!"
Shockley paused, looked again at the
whisky and drew the glass toward him
with the curving hand of a drinker. "You
want me to 'drink this?" he half laughed,
turning on his baiter.
"I didn't say so, did I? I said DRINK!"
roared Peg Leg.
Everybody looked at Shockley. He stood
fingering the glass quietly. Other guns
were creeping from their holsters. He
pusheS the glass back, smiling:.*
"I don't drink whisky,* partner,*' ealfl
Shockley, gently.
"You'll drink that whisky, or I'lliput a
little hole into you!"
Shockley reached good-naturedly for
the glass, threw the liquor on the floor
and set it back on the bar.
"Go on!" said Shockley. It confused
"Rubedo."
"And don't you know a. switchman
oughtn't t' put his feet In flatboats?
Don't you know some day you'll get your
foot stuck'ln a tongue or a guard? Then
where'll you be, Dutch, with a string; of
flats rolling down on you, eh?"
However, Chris stuck for his request.
He wouldn't take no for an answer.
"Well, for God's sake let up, Chris,"
said the yardmaster at last. "I'll come
down after Twenty-three comes in. Get
back early after cupper, and we'll make
up Fifty-five and let the rest go." .' Â¦
It: was -a pretty night; pretty enough
over the yard for anybody's Christmas,'
Julian or Gregorian. No snow, but a
moon, and a full one, rising early over
the Arlkaree bluffs, and a frost that bit
and sparkled. Happily for Christmas in
Little Russia, Twenty-three pulled in on
time; but it was long and heavy that
night. The minute the tired engine was
"Well, what's the racket anyhow,
Chris?" demanded Shockley lazily, after
Cross-Eyes trying to get rid of the invi
tation to the festivities had sputtered
switch-English five minutes at him.
"Ve got Chrlsmus by us," explained
Chris desperately.
"Christmas," repeated Shockley grimly.
"Christmas. Why, man, Christmas don't
come nowhere on earth In January.
Where'd vou get them shoes?"
"Dollar eefenty-vlfe." , â¢ .
But the frog-blocking was not what
worried Hhockley; his push was to keep
the yard clean, for the month of Decem
ber brought more stuff twice over than
was ever poured into the front-end yard
before. Chris, though, had developed Into
a great switchman, and the two never let
the work get ahead.
When the Russian holidays came, down
below, Chris concluded that the celebra
tion would be merely hollow without
Shockley, for was not the very existence
of Little Russia due to him?
"I notice Shockley Isn't keeping his
frogs blocked," continued Bucks, revert
ing to other matters. "That won't do. I
want every frog in the yard blocked and
kept blocked, and tell him I said so."
"we'll get Ms scalp, that's all. He'd bet
ter look after his conductors and leave
our men alone."
"Boys," said the yardmaster, with one
restless eye on Reynolds and one on
everybody else, as he pointed at Chris,
"this man's coat was burnt up.- He's a
poor devil, and his money comes hard.
Chip in for a new coat. I've nothing
against any man that don't want to Rive,
but Reynolds must pass the hat. Take
mine, you coyote."
Nearly everybody contributed as Rey
nolds went round. Shockley made no com
ments. "Count it," he commanded, when
the fallen monarch had finished; and
when the tale was made Shockley told
Pat Barlle to put (n as much more as
the cap held, and he did so.
"There. Chris; go home. I don't like
you," added Shockley insolently, turning
on Reynolds. "You don't know what fun
Is. This town won't hold you and me
after to-night You can take it or you
can leave it, but the first time I ever put
eyes on you again one of us will cash in-."
He backed directly toward the front
door .and out.
Peg Leg Reynolds took only the night
to decide; next day he hit the trail. The
nervy yardmaater he might have wiped
out if he had stayed, but the disgrace of
kneeling before the dog of a Russian was
something never to be wiped out In the
annals of Benkleton. Peg Leg moved on,
and thereafter cowboys took occasion to
stop Shockley on the street and Jolly him
on the way he did the one-legged bully,
and the lights were shot no more.
The railroad men swore by the new
yardmaster; the Russians took their cig
arettes from their mouths and touched
their caps when Shockley passed; Calla
han blessed his name, but little Chris
worshiped him. .
One day Alfabet Smith dropped off at
Benkleton from Omaha headquarters. Al
fabet was the west end spotter. "Who Is
that slfm fellow?" he asked of Callahan
as Shockley flew by on the pilot board of
an engine.
"That's Shockley."
"Oh, that's Shockley. ii It?"
But he could say little things In a way
to make a man prick all over.
"Yes, that's Shockley. Why?" asked
Callahan, with a dash of acid..
"Nothing, only he's a valuable man.
He's wanted, Shockley Is," smiled Alfabet
Smith.
Callahan took it up short.~"'Look here,
Alfabet. Keen- off Shockley."
"Why?"
"Why? Because you and I will touch,
head on, If you don't." J" Â»C
The next time ' Bucks was up, his as
sistant told him of the Incident.
"If he bothers Shockley," Bucks said.
Peg Leg's roasting gun sputtered an ac
companiment from the stove; but "as
Shockley, who stood in front of it, paid
no attention to the fusillade of bullets,
good form prevented others from dodging.
"That'll do; get down. Come here,
Chris." called Shockley. Chris Oxen,
greatly disturbed, issued from an ob
scure corner.
"Get down on your knees," exclaimed
the yardmaster. Jerking Reynolds with a
chilly twist in front of the frightened
Russian; "get on your knees; right
where I threw your whisky," and Shock
ley. crowding Reynolds down to his hu
miliation, dropped for the first time into
range civilities himself, and the shame
and the abasement of It were very great.
Maybe an hour later Reynolds was sit
ting back of the stove in a card game,
when a voice spoke at his ear. "'Get up!"
Reynolds looked around Into a pistol; be
hind it stood Sbockley, pleasant. "Get
up!" he repeated. Nobody had seen him
come In, but there he was, and with an
absolutely Infantile gun, a mere baby gun,
in the yellow light, but It shone like
bright silver. " .,
Reynolds with visible embarrassment
stood up.
"Throw your cannon into the stovo,
Reynolds, you won't need it," suggested
Shockley. Reynolds looked around; not a
cowboy interposed. Under convoy, Rey
nolds stumped over to the stove and
threw in his gun, but the grace of the do-
Ing was bad.
â¢'Get up there on the bar and dance;
hustle!" urged Shockley. They had to
help the confused cowboy up; and when
he stood shame-faced, looking down on
the scene of his constant triumphs, and
did a painful single foot, marking '.Ime
with his peg, the cowboys, who had stood
thelf own share of his bullying, roared.
Shockley didn't roar; only stood with
busy eyes where he could cover any man
on demand, not forgetting even Pat Bar-
He.
Peg Leg drained his glass before he
spoke. "Get out!" he snapped. The
switchman started on the word for the
front door.
"Where's your nerve?" asked the rail
road man. The gun covered him with a
flash and a roar. Reynolds, whatever his
faults, was a shot. His bullet cut clearly
through 'the crown, and the powder al
most burned Shockley's face. The
switchman recovered himself almost in
stantly, and taking off his cap laughed as
he examined the hole.
"Done with me?" he asked evenly, cap
in hand.
"Put a hole through It there," said he.
Reynolds get down his glass, and Shocfc
ley waited; It was the cowboy who hesi
tated.
Reynolds.'
"A man that'll waste good whisky
oughtn't to live, anyhow," he muttered,
fingering his revolver nervously. ''You've
spoiled my aim. Throw up your hat,"- he
yelled. "I'll put a hole through that to
begin with."
Instead, Shockley put his cap back on
his heed.
"Now," continued Callahan to himself,
timidly hopeful, "if the ctiss only doesn't
get to drinking!" He watched apprchen
eively, dreading the first time he should
pee him entering Pat Barlie's place, but
Ehockley didn't appear to know Pat had
a place. The cowboys, too, watched him,
waiting for his lamp to gleam at night
down In the yard, but Shockley got all
his work done by daylight.
The whole winter went without a brush
While he etood at the window he saw
their plus switch engine wheeze out of
the roundhouse, paw the new yardmaster
f.irt his hand at the engineer and swing
up on the footboard. But the swingâ It
made CaJlahan's heart warm to him. It
was the fwing of the tailor Into the
â¢shrouds, of the Cossack Into the caddie,
of the yacht Into the wind. It was like
falling down or falling up or falling on â
the >rrace of a mastery of gravitation.
"He's all right," muttered Callahan. It
was enough. â
As Callahan studied the claimant's In
offensive appearance, walking away, he
rather thought it couldn't be over or that
Bucks was mistaken; but Bucks never
made a mistake.
Next morning at 7 the new yardmaster
took hold. Callahan had Intimated that
the night air In the yard Â¦was miasmatic,
and that Ehockley had maybe better try
for a while to do his switching In the day
time. Just before the appointed hour In
the morning the assistant had looked out
on his unlucky yard; he thought to him
self that if that yard didn't. drive a man
to drink nothing ever would. Piled shanty
high with a bewildering array of ma
terial, it was enough to take the heart
out of a Denver switching crew.
"Step upstairs. 1*11 be up In a minute."
"Bucks sent me upâ to take the yard."
"What's your name?"
"Ebockley."
It was the yardmen who caught it, and
It gTew sÂ» bad they couldn't keep a
switchman. About 10 o'clock at night,
after Number Twenty-three had pulled in
and they war* distributing a trair.'.oad of
bridge timbers, a switchman's lantern
weald go up In signal, when plstJ a bul
let would knock the lamp clean out of
his band and th* nerv* clean out of his
T>Â»t4_ Cowboys shot away the lamps
tastsr Â«>>â¢Â» requisitions could be drawn
tar new onea. They shot the signals off
ths switches and the lights from the top
ef cor'.r.r trains. Whenever a brakeman
snowed a, flicker two cowboys stood wait-
Ins; to snuff It. If they missed the lamp
th*y winged the brakeman. It compelled
Bocks after a while to run trains throug-h
Benkleton without showing ever a, light.
At last Bucks, on whom the worry re
flectrii at headquarters, swore he would
flight them with fire, and he sent Shock
uy.
The next night a t&ll, thlnnlsh chap,
without visible reasons for alighting, got
â¢3 Ftfty-nlne and walked tentatively
down the platform. At the ticket office
hÂ« asked for the assistant superintendent.
"Out there on the platform, talking to
tÂ£Â» conductor."
The thin fellow emerged and headed for
Callahan. Callahan noticed only his light,
springy enable and his hatchet face.
"Mr. Callahan?"
"Tea."
The road was being pushed into the cat
tle country, and it was easy until they
Â¦truck Benkleton. Southwest of the yard,
where the river breaks sheer into the bot
toms, there hived a colony of railroad la
borers, Russians. They squatted there,
burrowed Into the face of the bench like
sand swallows, and scraped caves out for
themselves, and the name of the place is
Little Rucftla.
The cowboys, homesick for evil, would
rifle around Little Russia with rope and
gun and scare the pioneers crosseyed. The
headquarters of this restless gang were at
Pal Barlle's place, across from the post
efflce. To Callahan Pat Barlle's place
was a wasp's nest; but to Chris It was a
den of wolves.
So Cailahan eat thinking of the ingenu
ity of Chris and studying over Bucks' let
ter.
The yard was his worry. Not that it
was much of a yard; Just a dozen runs
off the lead. The trouble at the Benkle
ton yard came from without, not from
within.

f V*l33S=il!^)l i should have decided
Â£*x3jS9BEÂ«3Â£x!xg to let golf be the ar
biter of their fates. The two young men
were desperately In love with Marcia
Van Zandt. So, for that matter, were
half a dozen others of the male contin
gent at Westerfeldt But all recognized
that Greyson and Bradbury were the two
favorites, and the withdrawal of one of
them from the field would naturally place
the other in a fair position to win out.
It was Bradbury who offered the chal
lenge of a nine hole match, the loser of
which should immediately pack bag and
baggage and decamp. Greyson had con
sidered the proposition for a brief min
ute, then accepted, and a date was set
for the trial of skill.
Greyson won the toss and drove oft first,
making the straightaway in five, as he
generally did. Bradbury usually played
the first green In five also, but by a for
tunate approach shot he holed It la four,
thus gaining a lead of one.
The' next two holes, the ravin* and rest
a-while, were halved In five each, but on
the fourth putting green Greyson made a
phenomenal gobble and tied the score at
nineteen. <s
Without doubt It was not Intended by
the- two player* that ,thelr caddies should
know the stake which waa being played
for, but from several remarks which Scot
ty overheard as be trudged along with
the clubs he must have Jumped. at a pret
ty accurate conclusion. And as the four
rested In the shade at the fifth tee he con.
flded something to the new caddie from
town which made that youth observe the
remainder of the game with vastly more
interest than he had hitherto displayed.
Now, the fifth hole of the Westerfeldt
course, called the frying pan. Is the worst
one' of the nine, the drive-off being di
rectly over a deep gravel pit. It was on
this fair green that Bradbury stole a lead
of three, for by a good drive and a long
brassle shot he cleared tha hazard and
was In the hole In five.
The frying pan had always been a
Waterloo for Greyson, and on this day
It proved even worse th,an usual, for he
topped his ball twice, and then broke his.
mid Iron just above the whipping while
trying to recover. The next two holes
were halved in four each, so that the
score, as the two players . walked up to
the eighth tee, was 35 to 33 In Bradbury's
favor. Â¦
Whether It waa the result of an over-
(Copyright, 1903, by T. C. McClure.)
Indulgence In **rickies" on the previous
evening, overconfldence In victory." or
whether it was due simply to nervousness
on account of the size of the stakes for
which they werÂ© playing, will never be
known, but for some cause Bradbury
went to the bad on the eighth hole, and
It cost him six before he holed It, whereas
he usually played it In four, as his com
panion succeeded In doing.
Greyson's lead of three on this hole just
made up for the same number he had lost
on the fifth, so that the score at the last
green was again tied at thirty-nine.
There was an air of suppressed excite
ment about both players and caddies as
Greyson built his tee and prepared to
drive for the last time. The ninth hole
Is about 200 yards, and Is located on the
further side, of a little hill, so that only
the upper half of the red flag Is visible
from where the driver stands. Scotty,
the caddie, had gone on ahead, and when
Greyson's ball just cleared the brow of
the hill, he followed quickly after It and
disappeared over the other side.
He found that the ball had landed In
the middle of a bunch of fog. so that It
lay In an almost unplayable position. It
waa the work of but a moment to kick
the ball sharply from Its resting place
toward the hole, then he ran back to the
top of the bill and shouted:
"You're dead, two feet from the bole,
Mr. Greyson. It's a cinch for two."
Then the rlckles, or the nerves, or
something or other, got to work on Brad
bury again, for he sliced his drive and
the ball fell within 100 yards of the green.
He made a gallant attempt to recover,
however, and with his next stroke
stymied his ball with that of his compan
ion.
But the game was over, for Orsyson
putted In with his next stroke, winning
the match by one; then he walked up to
Bradbury and held out his hand.
"Hard luck, old man," he said cheerily,
"better luck next time."
As the two caddies walked back to the
greenkeeper's they talked over the game
Just finished, and after exacting a prom
ise of absolute secrecy Scotty revealed to
his companion his doing at the last hole.
"It wasn't 'cause Mr. Greysqn always
tips me that I monkeyed with the score."
he said In Justification of his action,
"though he Is the best man of the two.
and I hope he wins out with Miss Van
Zandt. I wouldn't have cooked that Brad
bury cuss, either, even If he did biff me
once or twice when I laughed at his scuf
fing, but I saw him foozle twice to-day
without counting It. and at the eighth
hole he lifted his ball out of a cuppy lie
when he thought no one was looking.
"And, anyway," he added, conclusively.
"as Agassiz or tome of them big poet
fellers say, 'all's fair In love and war,'
and I'm blamed glad I done it"
to-day, who Fays I won't be a sergeant
to-murr^w? Say yes to me. tfarlir.jir, and

"Then, be the powers, but I'll get such

There .was another original thing about
Corporal O'Toole. he got drunk the same
as he fell in love-ail at otic?. It had
been three years since he bad h.td a jag

gone lnt'-> ambush on the Dog Creek road.
Their ndvnnce and their presence had not
been discovered, and the next morning
would sec a train of twenty wagons
start down that road without an escort.
Corporal O'Toole put himself entirely In

take the road. It bade him whoop, yell
and cheer as he rode at a gallop. It
landed him in due time In the midst of
that ambush, and he was not sa drunk
but that ho could tell an Indian from a

redskins, but when he found a liberal

back and forth, j shooting:, shouting and
swearing and bringing mourning to dis
tant lodges, and It is a matter of record
that he got the band on the run and
chased the panic-stricken warriors for

Watson, In case I yield?" "It will be the
making of the bill," said Jack, with em
phasis. "Certainly I yield." said the

cloakroom.
Afterward the bill was re-reported. It
was very lengthy, and as soon as it was
read, one member after another arose
and moved to exempt nls county from the
operation of the law. Each motion pre
vailed, until there was left in the bill
only the county of the author of the bill
and the unrepresented county of San
Benito. Then some wag moved to ex
empt the county of the author. Against
his Indignant and wrathful protest tho
motion prevailed, and San Benito County
alone was blessed with a fence law
which, If It . had ever been enforced,
would have made It difficult for an in

Among the Legislators was a gentle

The Democrats of the Assembly, with
the eo-oprratlon and uneler the leader-

were attempting to defeat the passage
of an act allowing colored men to testify

San Jose was strenuously denouncing the
opponents of the bill. "\Vhy, Mr. Speak

and a storm. The unfortunate orator
.was "haled" up to the bar of the House,
and It was voted that he be reprimanded
by the Speaker and be required to apolo

grave silence and then offered his apolo

Congress from Louisiana was a young
lawyer from Central Ohio, who entered
the service as a lieutenant and fought his
way to the brigadier's stars, when he

sign first appeared on an office door a
stout gentleman rushed in and exclaimed:
"General, I am recommended to you. I
am in a fix. I have down at the levee
a steamboat-load of cotton which has
been tied up by the military authorities.
I have it contracted for at New Orleans,
to be loaded on a ship for Liverpool. If
I fail to get it there on time it will ruin
me. Minutes are dollars with me. They

that the commanding general knows you
and will listen to you; I cannot get ac

Can't 'you come at once with me in a
hack to headquarters, and' I will explain
the trouble as we go?"
The general accepted the employment.
He found that the matter was really very

replied: "I don't know, I haven't any
watch; and If your Honor continues to de
cide cases against me as you have been
doing this term so far, it Isn't likely that
I'll ever have any watch."
Frank Dunne was proceeding slowly
with a ponderous speech, when the Chief
Justice, after a moment's consultation
with his colleagues. Interrupted him.
"You need not discuss that point any
further, Mr. Dunne, the court Is with
you." "Then," drawled Duni\e, "I may
as well go home, for It is the only point
In the case."
The cause was submitted, and Dunne
went home. A few months later the de
cision came out. and, to Dunne's dismay,
the court, on more mature reflection, de
cided the appeal* against his client.
The next term Dunne had another case.
He stated his points and began his argu
ment, when a member of the court inter
rupted him and said: "These propositions
are elementary, Mr. Dunne; you need not
argue them, the court Is with you."
"No j you don't." replied Dunne. "You
told me that before, and when I went
home you decided the case against me.
Your Honors played me once; you can't
play me again. I'm going to argue the
case."

many times during his argument to "a

**l ORACE HAWES win a member of
I A the Stale Senate of California f'ora
I I San Mateo County In ,1863. His suc
~ J cess in obtalrlng sufficient votes to
cecure his election was a mystery,
for, although a man of distinguished
ability and '.earning, he was "that con
irary," as an unadmirlng constituent rt
marked, "that rather than unlatch and
open a gate leading Into a garden he
would w^lk half a mile in the hot sun and
climb over a high stone wall crowned with
broken glass and barbeu wire." He had
the most caustic tongue In California,
and the Senator who crossed his path
earned the title accorded to him who
rushes in where angels fear to tread.
"What does my colleague supppse that' I
came here for?" asked another Senator in
the course of his speech. Up- rose old
Horace and in nasal accents that were in
part natural and in part affected, he in
terposed: "Does my colleague want an
answer to that question?" "Yes. Mr.
President," was the reply, "I want an
answer." "My understanding is," enuf
fled Horace, "that my colleague had two
objects in coming here. Two, Mr. Presi
dentâgrand and petty larceny."
Senator Hawes was the author of an
elaborate and lengthy registration law.
While it was under discussion a Senator
from one of the mountain counties said,
"Mr. President, there is a mining camp on
the river bar, where my county joins two
other counties, and there is a voting pre
cinct there for each county. Now, I ask
the Senator from San Mateo, Is there
anything in his elaborate bill that would
prevent one cf my constituents from vot
ing in each pt the three countless?"
"Nothing whatever," replied Hawes. "I
thought so," rejoined the interrogating
Senator, "and such, being the case, what
is the use of this clumsy and bewildering
law?" "Because." rejoined Hawes, "while
there Is nothing in the bill Tb prevent the
misguided, unintelligent and law-defying
constituent of the Senator from casting
three votes, two of which would be Illegal,
yet If the Senator will closely consult the
punitive clauses of the bill he will find
that if his criminal constituent does vote
in each of the three counties he will, if
the law is enforced, be allotted from two
to twenty years In the penitentiary in
which to regret his action."
Hawes was authority on trusts and pro
bate law. and one of the sanest men in
California, but his will, in which he en
deavored to leave his property away from
his wife and daughter, and devote it to
the Monteagle University, which he pro
posed to found, was set aside by a verdict
of a Jury which found that the testator
was insane.
The wag of several Legislatures wsis
"little Jack Watson" of Los Angeies. One
session he occupied a seat next to a pieach
er from one of the ""cow" counties who was
fluent in speech, but unlearned in legis
lative ways. The bucolic Legislator had
reported a fence law, and was entitled
to the floor for a-*<peech. He unfolded
a huge roll of manuscript and adjusted
his spectacles. Whereupon a. gracelers

arose and said: "Mr. Speaker, I move to

to untangle things unless the command-
Ing general, who alone had the power,
would Issue a special order allowing the
boat to go.
The advocate had been on the staff of
the commanding general and was a fa
vorite with him. There had been only a
technical violation of the regulations, and
in ten minutes the cotton speculator had
the order of release in his pocket and
both were In the hack on the way to the
levee.
â¢ In the hack the client said. "Now, gen
eral, what is your bill?" "I paused," said
the general, "to consider what I ought
to charge. Back In Ohio I would prob
ably have taxed him $30: but I had been
successful, and as he said minutes were
dollars with him I thought mavbe he
would stand $500. But from habit I was
deliberate, and before I could reply he
had out a wallet stuffed with bills and
he counted out on my lap in succession
five bills, of the denomination of $1000
each. Then he paused and said. 'Will
that do?* What do you think I answered
him?" said' the general. "I rose to the
occasion and remarked, 'I guess you had
better put on another,' and he did."
Few men became multi-millionaires
without experiencing a change of heart.
Not such a change as is wrought at re
vival meetings, but rather a process of
ossification.
An Arizona client who had sold his
mine said to nvÂ» despairingly: "I mu3t
either give up this money, leave the coun
try or change my circle of acquaintances."
It Is not really purse-pride that Impels
the new made rich man to "shake" his
old acquaintances. It is the instinct of
financial self-preservation, for when you
Â¦know that a warm greeting to- an old
friend will Inevitably result either In your
loaning him, or, rather, giving him the
sum he asks for, or else in the ill feeling
that will be engendered In his breast by
your refusal, you will be tempted to not
see htm when you pass him in the street.
The millions accumulated by Philip D.
Armour of Chicago and his younger
brother. Herman O. Armour of New York,
never lost a friend to either of them.
Philip endowed the Armour Institute and
it 1Â» hi* noblest monument. The monu
ment of Herman will be found in the hun
dreds of hearts that beat in gratitude for
his unheralded benefactions. He was the
soul of honor, the life of enterprise, tha
cheeriest, kindliest, dearest old boy that
ever delighted to devote his leisure mo
ments and his surplus funds to helping
lame dogs "over stiles."
The Armour brothers as merchants were
original, active and enterprising, and as
speculators they were daring, sagacious
and indomitable. "Talk about yoar great
pork corner," said Herman Armour: "wÂ»
didn't corner pork. It was the other fel
lows who cornered themselves. We were
legitimate pork manufacturers. We
bought the hoe In the open market, cut
him ud and sold him to our 'customers.
We utilized every part of him. His meat
was salted and smoked: his hoofs ap
peared as glue, his bristles as brushes,
his stomach as pepsin, his blood as mate
rial for buttons, and of the rest of him
we made ammonia and fertilizers.
"Some Chicago * capitalist who had
money to burn ran the price of pork down,
and when it was so low that we could
buy It cheaper than we could make It
we bought it. and continued to buy It
until the speculators woke Â»â¢Â»> to the fact
that they had sold us for fi.iure delivery
not only a good deal more pork than they
hdd but than they could even make if
they could purchase and slaughter every
hog. between Canada and Mexico. Well,
we were the only dealers who had actual
pork to sell. We continued to Fell it
right along to our customers at $12 per
barrel, but the price to the speculators
who had tried to bankrupt us was $20
per barrel. They had sold it to us at $7
per barrel, and we sold it back to them
at $37 per barrel: but there was no cor
ner about It so far as we were concerned."
gentlemen laugh at me, eh, and then In
terrupt me, eh, and they deride me, eh,
and In my anger, when I am In possession
of a fact of this kind, I am apt to let
It slip, eh."
A proposition was made to purchase
several hundred copies of "Wood's Digest
for the use of 'members of the Legislature
and State officers. "Before I vote on this
measure," said a Senator ! from a far
northern' county, "I would like to know
whether Wood's Digest comes In bottles
or boxes." .
' Stephen J. Field was then Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of California, and
later Oscar L. Shatter 1 , who was a great
lawyer and a brilliant conversationalist,
and Silas \V. Sanderson, a man of .alert
perceptions and quick wit, were added to
the appellate -bench. The court never lost
its dignity, but it was mindful of Lord
Coke's saying that "The bench was grate
ful to the barrister who occasionally re
lieved the tedium of judicial proceedings
with a little honest hilarity."

PANAMA, Nov. 7.-r-The .. news of the
recognition - of the; independence of i tha
republic of Panama, cabled this morning
Senator Teller of Colorado said: 9^
"It looks to me as though , our Govern
ment" Is responsible for the condition of
affairs at Panama. We evidently ' have^
undertaken to force the "construction, of
the canal, even at the cost of going, to
war with Colombia. It- Is a very remark
able situation at Panama, and the estab
lishment of the new government. at Pan
ama and our hasty recognition of its in
dependence come so, unexpectedly that
those of us who are not behind the ad
ministration screens are obliged to await
further development before we dare com
ment upon the situation. I may have
something to Bay . on the subject, in the
Senate when I am better Informed than 'I
am now."
TELLER WANTS THE FACTS.
"The canal treaty if ratified would have
brought much to the isthmians, but,when
Colombia, evidently losing sight "entirely
of its great value, rejected It unanimous
ly, the people of the Isthmus were quick
to see their chance. Realizing that Con
gress was about* to meet in the United
States and the administration was sorely
tried by the rejection of the treaty, they
revolted. To protect the treaty rights and
obligations of the United States the Presi
dent could do nothing less than, take vig
orous stepa to prevent a recurrence of
warfare on the isthmus!"
President Discusses the Reciprocity,

â¢WH.1TJ5 HOUSE CONFERENCE.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â A conference
to review the work to be done at the ex
tra session of Congress and to discuss
matters of legislation during the regular
session was held at the WWte Houso to
day between President Roosevelt and
Senators Allison. Aldrich, Cjxllom, Platt
(of Connecticut), Hale and Spooner.
Cuban reciprocity legislation was dis
cussed for some time and the possible dif
ferences between the Senate' and the
House considered. All agreed that it
would not be wise to have a contest with
the House as to the form of legislation
and that an understanding should be
reached.
Members of the House agree that the
bill will contain articles 1 and 2 of the re
ciprocity treaty, the first referring to the
free list and the second to the 3) per
cent reduction on certain grains deported
from Cuba. The bill also will enact the
provisions of article 8, which provides
that there shall be no further reduction
of duty on sugar from Cuba or from any
other country during the life of the
treaty, which Is five years. Some mem
bers of the House desire to change one
provision In this article, in order to assert
the prerogative of the House as to rev
enue legislation.
The amended portion of the section pro
vided that" sugar should not be admitted
at a lower rate of duty than the law of
1S37, **by treaty or convention." The mem
bers of the House wish to make that pro
vision read "law." as they do not intend,
even by a slight implication, to admit
that, anything relating to . the tariff can
be done by treaty, or convention, but that
the House must originate the measure.
' .- It 13 evident from the opinions express
ed by Senators , at the White House to
day, that they will avoid any contention
with the House' on any point of this kind.
The Senate . therefore wltl be inclined to
accept any measure the House may pass
that will put the treaty into effect and
will indorse the eighth, article, regarding
non-interference with the sugar duty dur
ing the life of the treaty. Of course, it
is understood that one Congress cannot
bind the next, but it is claimed by those
who do not want the sugar schedule dis
turbed that the good faith of both houses
wUI.be pledged to the treaty provision
and that a change, therefore. Is wnUkely.
It ' Is , probable that the President wili
transmit ,V> the Senate the text of the
Cuban reciprocity treaty with his mes
sage on that subject on Tuesday. This
course would obviate the necessity of *
vote on ,. the . question of makins certaiu
treaty amendments public.

whole Panama situation with them at

publicans of the Senate' and House are
squarely aligned behind President Roose

held by this majority, which, it 13 ex
pected, will be augmented by many
Democrats in both branches of Congress.
There is general sympathy 'In Congress
for the isthmians who have fared so
badly at the hands of the Colombian
Government, and the advices which have
come to the State Department are taken
ex full assurances that the new-govern
ment, when finally organized, will be
stable and conservative and. friendly to
the United States.
Although the President- believes the
Spooner canal act "runs with the land"
and that he is, therefore, empowered ".to
go ahead with the government of Pana
ma, as he is directed by that act to do
with the government of Colombia, it will
be necessary to pass a . new \.blll appro
priating money to , be paid for thei canal
etrlp and to the Panama Canal Company.
It Is expected the United States will open
negotiations for a carnal ' treaty ..with
Panama' as soon as that government " Is
permanently organized. That the Presi
dent will lay the whole situation in
Panama before Congress by transmission
to the Senate of a new canal treaty
drawn onjsimilar lines to the Hay-Herran
treaty, but giving the United States even
greater concessions, is believed - to be
certain.

That the Isthmus will never again be
m-ithout an American military or naval
force is altogether probable. The admin
istration expects that the effort to con
struct the canal will be successful. Each
.terminal will be made an American coal
ing station, strongly fortified so that it
will command the waterway as com
pletely as England at Gibraltar com
mands the entrance to the Mediterranean.
The warships that will participate In,
affairs at the isthmus are: The Atlanta,
Dixie and Nashville, at Colon; the Bos
ton, Wyoming. Concord and Marblehead,
en route to Panama; the Maine, en
roote to Colon; the Mayflower and the

CALL BUREAU. HOC G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON. Nov. 7.â
It can be stated on the highest
authority that If Colombia en
deavors .to send troops to the
Isthmus by sea they will . be - prevented
landing by the American naval force.
The roads to the Isthmus from the In
terior of. Colombia are so bad that it Is
regarded as the work of months to tra
verse the distance.
The administration is resolved to keep
isthmian transit open. It was announced
to-day that the battleship Maine._now en
route from Newport to Hampton"" Roads,
would go at once to Colon. The May
flower, carrying Rear Admiral Coghlan
and Consul Gudger. who to-day received
verbal Instructions from the , President
and who mill be ranking consular officer
la Panama, will leave Washington for
Colon at 9 o'clock to-morrow, morning.
This makes ten chips already en route or
ordered to the Isthmus.
At the Navy Department it is said that
the marines are capable of coring with
the situation, either temporarily or during
long occupation. The postponement until
December 15 of the departure from New
York for the Philippines of the army
transport Kilpatrick, ostensibly for re
pairs when she really needs " no repairs,
is significant. She will thus be available
to carry regiments to the isthmus If nec
essary.

that the people are once and

ed to draw again that day 5200,000 against
that account. Dresser told him be had
no right to do it. Pam asksd Dresser if
he appreciated what it meant if he should
do it and If the trust company refused to
honor the check the next morning when
it came through the . clearing-house.
Dresser answered that It meant that the
Tru3t Company -of ' the Republic wa3 in

condition and he proposed to do it, and 'he
did it, and finally," before the. end of Jan

that there are still thirty-nine Republi

of the first session of the Fifty-seventh
Congress. The principle is the same now
as It was then and our effort Is to pre
vent any breaking of the great principle
of protection on which the industries and
the prosperity of this country are
founded. The league contends that reci
procity by any treaty Is a denial of pro

from Dover to Calais in a collapsible boat
drawn by a kite, on October 10 and No

a box kite and was capable of lifting sev

PARIS, Nov. 7.â Before giving a formal
recognition by France of the republic of
Panama. Foreign Minister Delcasse has
decided to obtain a specific declaration
that the new regime will carry out Co
lombia's former obligations in connection
with the canal and oiner French prop
erty interests. Until this declaration Is
unmistakably given French recognition
Â«vlir be withheld, but as soon as it is
given, there is the best reason to be
lieve, France will recognize the independ
ence of the new state. Cable inquiries
arc now proceeding to obtain the specific
assurance ro<iuired.
The French Consul at Panama cabled
yesterday that Panama would assume Co
lombia's former treaty and legal obliga
tions. This is considered by the officials
here as making practically certain the
intentions of the new state toward French
property rights.
The officials here construe the action
taken by the United States as being equiv
alent to a full recognition of the new state.
Will Require Specific Declaration of
Panama's Intention.
FRANCE WANTS ASSURANCES.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 7.â In the ab

Pussia Awaits Developments.
The Patrle sets forth that the Govern
ment of Colombia has decided to "not
permit the United States to take part of
her territory under the pretext of cre
ating a new republic."
PARIS. Nov. 7.â The Patric this after
noon published in a dispatch from Ant
werp, Belgium, an Interview with Gon
zales Torres, Consul General of Colom
bia, who says he has just received a dis
patch from Colombia announcing that
7000 troops are about to arrive at Savan
111a on their way to Colon. Among the
number are 500 men from the Department
of *kntloquai. The Department of Boyaca
also Is furnishing its contingent.
Consul General . Torres adds that the
action of tho American naval forces at
Colon prevented Colombia sending troop's
to Panama to suppre3s the uprising, thus
preventing Colombia fulfilling her treaty
obligation to maintain order. He de
clares further that in spite of American
interference Colombia will fulfill her
treaty duties and will march troops by
land to Panama.

WASHINGTON. Nov. 7.â To-day's ad
vices to the State Department indicated
a regular development of the new Gov
ernment of Panama. 1 The most Important
announcement indicative of a speedy es
tablishment of full diplomatic relations
with the new republic was the appoint
ment of Bunau-Varilla as the agent of
Panama in the United States^ With him
the United States Government will trans
act any necessary business In an unof
ficial way, pending the appointment of
regular ministers plenipotentiary.

eral to Panama, who will sail to-morrow
for that port, calird at the State Depart
ment to-day for a further conference
with Secretary Hay, at whose instance he
lat'T conferred with the President.
The British Government has formally
requested the State Department to look
after the British subjects on the isthmus,
and pimilar requests from other European
nations are expected, all of which will be
promptly granted. There are reasons
why it is desirable that a large foreign
State Department Decides to Open
Canal Negotiations.
WILL DEAL WITH PANAMA.
PANAMA', Nov. 7.â M. Phillippe Bunau-
Varilla has been appointed diplomatic
agent of the Republic of Panama at
Washington. He is one of the financial
agents of tho Panama Canal Company.
His first official act was to officially noti
fy the Junta that the United States had
recognized the de facto Government of
Panama. The news has caused great re
joicing here and was telegraphed through
out the country. Preparations are being
made to celebrato the event with great
enthusiasm.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â The State De
partment, having received unofficial but
reliable notification of the appointment
of Bunau-Varilla as diplomatic agent at
Washington for the new republic of Pan
ama, has decided to recognize him in that
capacity.
Bunau-Varilla arrived in Washington
late to-night. Y.'lthout registering, he
left his hotel in a carriage, saying that
he would return in an hour. He intimated
that he would see the President or State
Department officials to-niorrow.
"You can ray for me." said Bunau-Var
illa, with great earnestness, "not only
that the isthmian people want a canal,
but that they v.-il! have one, and that
they will readily grant every facility to
the United States to complete a treaty
and construct the canal. I shall take up
the matter with the Secretary of State
as soon as I see him."
PARIS, Nov. 7.â M. Bunau-Varilla. who
has been appointed diplomatic agent of
the republic of Panama at Washington,
is a brother of Maurice, Varilla, president
of the Matin Company of Paris, and one
of the engineers who took an active part
in the wofk done toward the construction
of tho Panama canal.

ing made. .
by Bunau-Varilla. the diplomatic agent
at Washington of the republic, spread
rapidly through the town, and the heavy
fall of rain which prevailed could not
dampen the enthusiasm which dominated
the :sthmians over the announcement.
The d.iy was declared a holiday, and even
the foreigners in Panama .joined in the
jubilee. .
The United States cruiser Boston
ieachsd here to-day. Her arrival was
made the occasion of great rejoicing and
enthusiasm is at a high pitch. When the
executive officer of the Boston landed he
was received by crowds headed by bands
and carrying the Stars and Stripes and
the flag of the republic of Panama. The
bands played the American anthem. The
populace is still parading about the town
and a large number of foreigners are join
ing in the demonstration. Commander
Diehl of the Boston will not come ashore
urtil to-morow.
BERLIN, Nov. 7.â Germany has not yet
taken into consideration the question of
recognition of the republic of "Panama
and will await the United States' formal
recognition. Germany admits that among
the great powers the United States is the
country most immediately concerned and
will shape bjer course with especial ref
erence to that fact. Germany will pre
serve a strict but friendly neutrality.
Germany in No Hurry to Act.
LONDON, Nov. 7.â No steps have- been
taken by the British Government, or are
likely to be taken -jn the immediate fu
ture, toward the formal recognition of
the independence of Panama and no re
quest has been received thus far looking
to that end. President Roosevelt's action
and Secretary Hay's statement are not
construed by the Foreign Office as being
a formal recognition of Panama's inde
pendence. Great Britain will Instruct her
consular and diplomatic authorities on the
Isthmus to communicate, in case of ne
cessity, with suchgovernment as may ex
ist in Panama, but they will not construe
that as a formal recognition of Panama's
independence. Up to to-night Colombia
had made no protest here.
Will Not Immediately Recognize the
New Republic.
GREAT BRITAIN'S ATTITUDE.
NEW YORK, Nov. 7.â The battleship
Maine has been ordered to Colon. She
has sailed from Marthas Vineyard for
Hampton Roads, where she will coal and
proceed to her destination.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â It was stated
at the Navy Department that the sudden
departure of the Maine to Colon is not
because there Is any particular. necessity
for the presence there of big battleships.
The navy, it is stated, is deficient in
squadron movements, and the Navigation
Bureau desires to remedy this deficit
wherever itracticable. The Maine, it is
further said, has been at the navy yard
during a good part of the last year, and
the cruise to the Isthmus will be bene
ficial to discipline.
Admiral Coghlan, who will sail from
Washington to-morrow morning with
Consul General Gudger for Colon, has de
cided to retain the Mayflower as his flag
ship while at Colon until the arrival of
his permanent flagship, the Olympia,
which should follow him from Norfolk in
about one month.
for Colon.
MAINE GOES TO THE ISTHMUS.
Battleship Is Ordered to Sail at Once
Government opinion and sentiment gen
erally approves thecourse of the United
States. The newspapers commend Presi
dent Roosevelt and Secretary Hay. A
large portrait of Mr. Roosevelt occupies
the first page of the Matin to-day, with
the declaration that, he has conferred a
benefit on humanity by putting an end
to Colombia's obstruction of the path of
progress.
Panama canal shares continued to rise
to-day, the advance varying from 3 to 5
francs throughout the list. Five per cents
rose from 57.50 to 62.50: 3 per cents were
up from 39.50 to 42; new 6 per cent first
series rose from 74.50 to 79,Â« and the sec
ond series went up from 69 to 72.50.
Significant of the strength of this de
cision was the appearance at the State
Department of Rear Admiral John O.
Walker, U. S. N., retired, president of the
.Isthmian Canal Commission, who has
been in frequent conference with the
President and Secretary Hay In the past
three days. Upon him will probably de
volve the initiation of the practical work
ing out of the canal project, and he is
keeping himself fully posted as to every
development here in Washington, while
Colonel William Black of the engineer
corps of the army, who has been engaged
in looking after the physical aspects of
the canal problem on the isthmus for the
past few months, has been supplying in
formation from that quarter.
naval representation In isthmian waters
should be discouraged just now, and until
the new Government is permanently es
tablished. It is expected here that there,
will be little delay about such establish
ment, and as soon as there Is a regular
Government at Panama in place of the
present Junta, the State Department ex
pects to take up negotiations for the ex
ecution of the canal project.
The State Department has decided that,
so far as it is concerned, it regards the
treaties that governed Colombia, or as to
New Granada, as Btlll in force, and
therefore all concessions, including that
of the Panama Canal Company, are valid
and in force.
The State Department also has decided
that, owing to the fact that the Spooner
canal act in terms required the United
States before beginning the* canal to con
clude a treaty with Colombia, the spirit
of the act will be met by the conclusion
of an arrangement with the new State of
Panama on the lines of the Spooner act,
and It will proceed to this end. In other
words, It Is held that just as the engage
ments entered into by the United States
with New Granada have ever since been
regarded as binding in regard to Colom
bia, so, accepting the common law doc
trine in such cases as binding, the de
partment Is authorized to read "Panama"
instead of "Colombia" in the Spooner act.
In this sense, it is pointed out, the Pres
ident will find It unnecessary, unless he
cares to do so, to go to Congress for fur
ther legislation to authorize the con
struction of the Panama Canal.

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 7.â William L.
Klkins, the multi-millionaire traction
magnate and financier, died at his home
at Ashbourne, near here, to-night from
a complication of diseases at the age of
71 years. E'.kins' illness, which became
alarming about three weeks ago, really
dated from last spring, when he narrowly
escaped death. A heavy iron girder,
which was being hoisted to the top of a
new oflice building at Broad and Chest
nut streets; of which he was part owner,
fell to the ground, just grazing Mr. El
kins, who was passing. The shock se
riously affected his nervous system. The
immediate cause of death was blood pois
oning, added to which was a combination
of kidney, troubles, rheumatism and rheu
matic gout.

ROME, Nov. 7.â It is learned that the
Pope is studying a project submitted to
him by Cardinal Moran, the object pf
which is -the withdrawal of America and
Australia from the jurisdiction of the
congregation of the propaganda.
The project provides the kind of auton
omy of two countries under responsibil
ities of their respective Cardinals. Their
dependence on Koine will be merely on
questions of dogma. It seems the Pope
is inclined to take the steps proposed an
the result of increase of disputes among
the clergy of the two countries which the
propaganda has been unable to settle and
also because of a lack of familiarity on
the part of the propaganda of local feel
ings in the countries concerned.

Special Dispatch to The Call
ASTORIA, Or., Nov. 7.â The British
bark Dunslaw. which departed from As
toria November S for South Africa, with
a cargo of flour and wheat, is reported to
be disabled off the Columbia River.
The Dun3'.aw was sighted by the Ger
man bark Professor Kock, Captain Shutte,
arriving to-day from Bremen vla^ Port
Los Angeles. The Dunslaw 'was in lati
tude 47 north, about sixty miles off the
river mouth.
I Captain Shutte reports that he sighted
the b3rk at noon yesterday. All her
square sails had been blown away and
the fore topgallant yard was swinging
I loosely about. An hour later the yard
! went by the board. The Professor Kock
! hoisted a flag, but received no reply from
the disabled vessel. While Captain Shutte
was unable to make out her name, there
is no doubt here that she Is the Dunslaw.
She had black sides, red bottom, double
lower yards, but no royals, corresponding
exactly with the rig of the Dunslaw.
When last seen she was making for the
Columbia under stay sails and spanker.
Captain Latham, the bar pilot who took
the Dunslaw out, says the description tal
lies. Latham adds that the bark had an
inexperienced crew, which probably has
been unable to handle the vessel in the
gale which has raged almost incessantly
for the past ten days.
The master of the Kock reports that a
hurricane prevailed at sea on November 4
and 5. It is believed here that the Dun
slaw will succeed in making port unless
the gale Increases in fury. She Is ln com
mand of Captain Nichol.

The influence of the continued opera
tions of the bond conversion syndicate
was also the subject for discussion. The
statement to the Stock Exchange in con
nection with the listing of the corpora
tion's second mortgage bonds revealed the
fact that some $t>6,000,000 of preferred
stock was still available for conversion
into bonds with the privilege of conver
sion exclusively in the syndicate. The ex
ercise of this privilege would presumably
Involve the purchase of preferred Btock
by the syndicate and the increase of the
market supply of the bond^. resulting
from the conversion. Yet the pressure
to sell the preferred stock far outweighed
any obsorption for syndicate account.
The difference in the prices of the pre
ferred stock and the bonds was thus con
siderably extended, and this difference
measures the profit to. the syndicate of
the process of conversion aside from the
4 per cent commission insured to them
t'r.der the contract with the corporation
on tho par value of the preferred stock
converted. The incident which was effec
tive In disturbing sentiment over the iron
and steel trade conditions was the cut in
price of steel billets of $4 per ton. Re
ports of large sales of steel products for
foreign account were considered cor
roborative of the shrinkage of the do
mestic demand and the break In prices to
secure the market. Fears were felt of a
general reduction of prices for all lines of
steel products and a process of contrac
tion throughout the 8tate. Plans for a
further restriction of production and ru
mois of a large reduction In the force of
laborers employed helped to feed the ap
prehension of the speculative public over
the future of the industrials of this class.
Stocks of independent iron and steel com
panies were affected in sympathy, though
less actively than thÂ« United States
Steel securities. There was resumption of
the conservative attitude of bankers and
money lenders, which had begun to be
somewhat relaxed with the long delay in
the crop-moving demands for currency.
This demand, though belated, has risen
this, week to rather above the normal of
preceding year?, warning tho banking
community that their preparations for"
such a contingency were not mistaken."
Reports from London show a hardening
market for discounts and an increased
control of tho open money market by the
Bank o^ England. This may be in prepa
ration to make effective th? Bank of Eng
land's rate of discount to oppose the out
go of gold. The stock market community
has been largely devoted to the condi
tions and prospects in the iron and steel
trade this week and the renewed heavy
liquidation In the United States Steel se
curities has disturbed the whole market.
The course of the money market has Been
a contributory influence. The interrup
tion of the election day holiday also had
the usual effect of discouraging specula
tive activity except for some professional
operations in the New York corporation
stocks, which were nominally based upon
the political contest in the city. The en
gagement of a million dollars in gold in
London for shipment to New York was
made the occasion for some buying of
stocks on Monday and early on Wednes
day after the holiday Interval, on the as
sumption that automatic relief from other
demands upon New York cash supplies
was thus insured, but the latter-weakness
of the United States Steel stocks and
their overwhelming preponderance In the
dealings dominated the whole market and.
tarried prices downward. The heavy
liquidation in these stocks was commonly
attributed to trade conditions, but sug
gestions were also heardof motives from
the financial side for the selling. For in
stance, large selling of the preferred
stock for London here was said to be for
account of a brokerage firm there which
was tided over the last London settle
ment and was presumably left in a vul
nerable position. It was current rumor
in the. stock market that some of the sell
ing was due to changes in the executive
department "of the corporation at differ
ent times since Its formation. As this is
a result of these suppositions there was
a crop of rumors also of further changes
to come in the executive department and
of resulting friction and antagonism. Au
thoritative information on these points
was not to be had and the market opera
tors in the securities were left to sur
mise whether these rumors were not Bet
afloat to confuse the 'public as to the
causee in the Industrial situation to in
duce the selling.
CUT IK PRICES FEARED.
The railroad list in fact was but llttla
affected by the opening dip in Steel pre
ferred. The upward movement was ex
tremely sluggish and dull and the market
showed little breadth or animation. Re
ports were in persistent circulation that
the United States Steel Corporation
planned a cut in all grades of steel pro
ducts on the basis of the lower price for
billets, but all attempts to secure official
information on the subject were repelled.
The bank statement was regarded as fa
vorable on account of the heavy loan con
traction disclosed, although the cash de
crease , was about as large as had been
estimated. The decrease in deposits re
duced the reserve requirements so far
that rather more than half of last week's
surplus Is conserved. Tha decrease in
loans is attributed in part to the liquida
tion in the stock market and to repay
ments incident to the completion of nor
mal settlements. Some of the borrowings
of last week incident to the crisis at St.
Louis are also believed to have been re
paid. The money and exchange markets
are rather nominal on Saturday, but the
to^e of sterling was reported weak and
demand bills were quoted at $4 S4 flat,
which is within the margin of profit in
gold imports. None were announced, but
there wtre various rumors of further en
gamements.

CHICAGO, Nov. 7.â Music, the rattle of
a passing trolley car and accents of the
human voice were heard for the first
time in his /life to-day by 11-year-old
James CannorV. Tears welled to the boy's
eyes as, through the" medium of a wonder
ful machine invented for the purpose of
making the deaf hear, he heard the*words
"Papa", and "Mamma," spoken by Miss
Cornelia Bingham, principal of McCowcn
Oral School.
The occasion 'was the test of an appar
atus invented by Miller Reese Hutchison,
a young Alabaman, now living in New
York. It is said to be the development
of an Idea voiced by Dr. Graham Bell,
the inventor of tho telephone. The ma
chine used to-day is inclosed in a box
about two feet square and fitted with a
receiver similar in appearance to those
worn on heads of girls in telephone ex

about three inches ln diameter, in the

which is a. secret of the inventor. An

WASHINGTON. Nov. 7.â At the caucus
of the Republican members of the House
of Representatives held in the hall of the
House to-night Joseph G. Cannon of Illi
nois was unanimously chosen as the can
didate of the majority as Speaker of the
House. , This action assures his election
on Monday. Representative Hepburn of
Iowa was elected presiding officer of the
caucus, and Loudenslager of New Jersey
secretary. The roll call showed ISO mem
bers present. Representative Dalzlell of
Pennsylvania placed Mr. Cannon in nom
inations. After Representative Sherman
of New York had seconded it the selection
was made unanimous. Mr. Cannon ad
dressing the caucus said:
"Almost continuous service in the House
for twenty-eight years, sometimes in. the
majority and sometimes ln the minority,
has made me proud of the House of Rep
resentatives and proud of the people, who
make it, by their direct vote, every" two
'years. It is a representative body, voic
ing the policy of the majority and legis
lating for all the people. ,
"The Republican party stands for those
policies that have ln the main prevailed
since IS61, under- which in forty years from
a comparatively small nation we have
grown to be first among: the nations of
the earth; and sovereignty with us is the
people. The Republican party, being in
the majority, is responsible and is entitled
to the credit.
"Under these policies we enjoy material
.well-being, exceeding that of any former
period in our existence. The people never
were so well and profitably employed as
now, and consumption of the product of
each individual engaged In gainful occu
pation was never before so generous and
profitable to all, at the same time leaving
a surplus for future need ln the shape,
of capital which is better distributed |
among the people and much larger in the
aggregate than ever before.
"It is not strange, under these condi
tions, that a comparatively small, num
ber of people should seek to overcapitai
ize the machinery of production and ex
change. But the refusal of the multitude
to invest its savfngs in suco-overcapital
ization has destroyed fictitious values and
ffie recovery from local indigestion aris
ing from coneumption of wind and water
is assumed. .- . .
"Needed legislation was fairly enacted
under the lead of the Republican party
by the last Congress and the laws of the
country are being enforced by the execu
tive as the constitution contemplated by
wise . administration and through the
courts. â¢ â¢
"Under these conditions, in my judg
ment, our policy should be to consider
and enact proper legislation covering the
convention for reciprocal trade between
the United States and Cuba; to make
generous, 'not extravagant, appropriations
at the regular session' of Congress for the
public service; then to' adjourn and re
turn to our homes, and the people, set
ting the seal of approval upon our action,
will do the remainder, working out their
own salvation.'

ROME, Nov. 7.â To his habit of bathing
each year in the frothing new wine grown
on his estate is due ttie death of Char
rere < a wealthy farmer near Aosta. Char
rere believed that his plunge in the wine
insured a year's prosperity for himself
and family. This year he entered his
cellar as usual. His sister followed him
some -timo later and, on searching for
him, found him unconscious in the wine.
In endeavoring to rescue him she was
also overcome by the fumes, and both
died before assistance could be summoned.

' BERLIN. Nov. 7.â The ' transfer of

â¢prominent families of the empire, was !
several years ago sentenced to a life term
In the penitentiary for murders which he
had committed In German Southwest

imprisonment In the State Prison of Han
over his influential relatives tried every
means of having him declared insane, and
they have now succeeded in part, though
they have always thought that he would
be transferred to a private sanitarium.
The privileges given to the Prince during
h.s imprisonment were of such a nature
that he was practically allowed full
freedom inside the prison gates and that
circumstance has caused several violent
attacks upon the Government by the So
cialistic press.

Mr. Newton contended that Mr. Bryan's
duty as executor in rto way conflicted with
his other, duty under the will.
Judge Cleaveland ruled that he had no
discretion In the matter and had no right
to prevent Mr. . Bryan from, qualifying- as
executor. When the amount of the bond
was broached Mr. Bryan said to the [court:
."The -amount of the estate Is on tts face
valuo about $302,000."
Mr. Newton answered: "Mr. Bryan will
not appeal from the admission of the will
to probate. Whether he will appeal on
the court's decision to exclude the sealed
letter he is not required to state now."
Mr. Stoddard then began a speech of
further protest and explanation, saying:
"Your Honor has decided that that
sealed letter is not a part of the will.. We
shall insist upon the performance of his
duty as executor if Mr. Bryan is to act as
such. He cannot serve two masters in
this manner. If he intends to uphold the
law as your Honor has spoken it in your
decision, it will be contrary to the law
to undertake to destroy that will. By
taking appeal from your decision Mr.
Bryan undertakes a course for the ad
vantage of himself and his family. This
is a property affair. If that sealed letter
13 a part of the will Mr. Bryan's family
have a property interest, and unless by
some formal renunciation he puts beyond
ptradventure the question of whether he
will try* to take advantage of that sealed
letter he may also be considered to claim
a property interest. It is also utterly in
consistent for Mr. Bryan to act as ex
ecutor and at the same time take an ap
peal from the court's decision. If your
Honor should hold that that Is law, I
shall advise my clients to take an appeal
to test that matter."
"Then I enter protest now against Mr.
Kryan as executor," said Judge Stod
dard. â¢
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 7.-In the
probate court to-day AVIIllam J. Bryan
was admitted to act as executor of the
will of Philo S. Bennett, en objection to
him made by Mrs. Bennett's counsel being
overruled. The amount of the -bond was
fixed at $350,000. Counsel on both sides
indicated that an appeal v,-ill be taken.
Court proceedings opened with, a ques
tion from Judge Cleaveland, who presided,
as to whether counsel desired to be heard
oh the form of the decree to be entered
In the case. After some discussion" It was
agreed that a conference between counsel
on both sides early next week should db
termine the form of decree to be submit
ted to the court for approval.
Judge Stoddard asked jf counsel for the
executors would state definitely whether
Bryan intended to qualify as an executor.
. Mr. 'Ncv/ton, counsel for Mr. Bryan,
said that Mr. Bryan intended to qualify
and to act as executor.
"Then I want to know further." said
Judge Stcddard, "if Mr. Bryan intends to

A specially. interesting feature in a float
ing cavity of the photosphere is any In
dication that Its dark depths form a
whirlpool, according to the theory of M.
Faye, the French , scientist. A cyclonlo
tendency was noticed in several- spots,
the roost remarkable being those of Jan
uary," 1892, and April, 1S79. On August 25,
1804, the visible surface was in a more un
spotted , condition than for at least two
years and ten months previous. Thence
forth a spotless disk became more fre
quent, 'the' culmination being eighty-six
days distributed throughout 1901 and 147
days throughout 1892." Of these latter,
from June 12 to September 11, the sur
face was in a state of unusual quietude.
Occasional ; cloudy days, However, broke
the positive evidence ' that three months
of continued quietude had existed. From
1897 tracts not far from the sun's equa
tor were the scene of agitation, but with
in the last two years higher latitudes
The recent great spot, the largest in
five years, reappeared in due time on the
1st of November and, though decreased
in size, an additional outbreak in the rear
rendered It again visible to the naked
eye as it crossed the disk. There is good
evidence that many of the largest spots
were of long duration and came round to
View more than once, but complete identi
fication is: difficult on account of change
of form and position when on the unseen
side of the rotating orb. On a few occa
sions a disconnected stream of average
eruptions from east to west revealed a
wide distribution of activity. The most
conspicuous' case during the cycle oc
curred^ln the latter half of May, 1894,
when three-fourths of the circumference
was wreathed in spots from twenty to
thirty degrees apart. A lesser display of
streamlness took place thrice In 1895, once

outline of the possibilities of solar agi
tation. Dwarfed by a distance of 93,000,
000 miles, monster discoloration* of every
shape have, penned their stormy history
again and again on the photospheric tab
let, but as yet these hieroglyphics of the
sun have remained partly unread.
liair century, observations dating from
1619 established the fact that a large area
of the colar surface is profusely spot
strewn for a few consecutive years, a
condition invariably followed by a grad
ual decrease until weeks may pass with
out a single spot. These alternate condi
tions, known as the sunspot maximum
and minimum, form a cycle generally
lasting about eleven and one-tenth years.
Though the extremes are In marked con
trast, the boundary between them is not
sharply defined nor has it a permanently
midway position.
That the surface of a vaporous and in
tensely heated body, more than a million
times the size of the earth, should be in a
state of tumultuous disturbance accords
with the known laws of heat and gravita
tion; but when it was found that solar
tempests announce their presence by a
deep-hued stain, show a distinct prefer
ence for certain zones of the sun, ob
serve unexplained laws as to differing
rates of speed across the disk and main
tain a fairly punctual period of increase
Ruling the motions of the earth and
other planets by the attraction of its enor
mous mate, redeeming them from per
petual gloom with its radiance, the potent
orb is neverthless Itself dominated by an
unknown force so effective and unfailing
in its operations that scientific interest
has been keenly aroused during the last
colar activity has set in, stupendous
formations have Invaded the disk, and
during the coming years an unspotted
photosphere will be a rare spectacle to the
telescopic student of solar physics.

BY ROSE O'HAIiLORAN.
The first, one of the largest on record,
measuring 150,000 miles in length and 75,
000 in breadth, appeared inside the south
east limb on the :4th of February, 1892;
the Becond assumed nearly equal dimen
sions when it plowed the central tracts of
the southern hemisphere in the beginning
of August, 1S93; the third, with compact
umbra and enormous penumbra, tinged
GIANT SPOTS APPEAR.
My recorded observations were com
menced on the 1st of November, 1891. The
critical period in the career of an average
spot being its first invasion of photo
epheric whiteness, one aim of these obser
vations has been to note tho number of
times that this was seen to have oc
curred. A disfigured area, whether stained
by one spot or by many, is classed as one
solar storm when the sprinkling does not
extend beyond twenty-five degrees of the
sun's surface, which, being about the
limit of the largest spots, gives some clew
as to the probable range of a single dis
turbance. This method, though giving a
far lower numerical result than if each
section of a discoloration were counted,
avoids including any spot more than once.
From November 1, 1891, to the same date
of the present year, 1S03, the sun was ob
served and the results recorded on 2982
days, and according to the method of
enumeration adopted 811 spotted areas
were seen on the disk, during that time.
Two-thirds of the disturbances appeared
within the first five years, the remainder
being distributed over tho ensuing years
with decreasing frequency until Septem
ber, 1902, when a slight but distinct In
crease of activity set in.
During the maximum and minimum be
tween 1879 and 1890 the spottedness of the
surface south of the sun's equator was
rcore than double that of the northern
zones, according to Comstock's text booK
ot astronomy, and from November, 1831,
to the present date solar storms have
also been fewer in the northern hemis
phere, but in the lesser disparity of seven
to ten. Owing to misleading perspective
effects at certain seasons this estimate
was deduced from &67 eruptions distinctly
beyond equatorial zones. In which latter
accurate measurement of solar latitude
Is difficult. Of the entire number of spot
ted areas, namely 811, about â¢ forty, up
ward of 60,000 miles in length, may be
classed as large, while solar tempests
which from depth of hue combined with
Immense extent may be called giant spots
stained the white orb to the distinct gaze
of the world at large on four notable oc
casions. .
EYE CATCHES FACTS.
The following account, based on solar
studies with a four-inch Brashear refrac
tor, contains the chief characteristics of
the period recently completed:
An interruption of some length in the
record, due to a Journey to obsarve tho
eclipse of 1900 having occurred during the
sunspot minimum, causes Iitte material
change in the outline. According to a re
cent careful revision of sunspot data pub
lished by Professor A. AValfer of France,
the minimum preceding this Just past was
at its extreme stage of unspottedness dur
ing the first months of 1S90, and as a cor
responding stage did not occur until the
summer of 1&02, this solar cycle has been
unusually prolonged. The last maximum
showed Its approach toward the end of
1891, continuing the three following years,
but though a slight renewal of disturb
ance was noticeable since last September,
It is only now, twelve years later, that the
corresponding stage of a returning maxi
mum is clearly indicated.
None of these theories, however, ac
count for the various complexities no
ticeable, while the eleven-year period
seems the most unsolvable of all sun mys
teries. Of late years maxima and minima
have been carefully studied in detail, as
only thus can further enlightenment be
obtained, and as every locality is more or
less subject to cloudiness, the combined
records of several telescopists are gener
ally requisite for a complete cycle of ot>
servation. '
and decline, the cause of these peculiari
ties became one -of the foremost of astro
nomical problems.
SOME FAVORABLE THEORIES.
Among many diverse theories the fol
lowing: receive the most favorable con
sideration: The dark areas may be the
result of a downpour of passing meteors;
or, in the climax of colliding' currents on
the seething surface, vapors may be cast
forth, and on descending again in a state
of comparative coolness, seem dark by
contrast; or, violent â¢whirlpools may fre
qeunt these zones most suited for cyclonic
formation, and by auction bring- down
volumes of cooler matter from, above.

ABOUT
DIAMONDS
The Question of why one man succeeds
and another falls, is a problem that has
puzzled the philosophers for centuries.
One man attains riches and position,
while his neighbor who started with
seemlnglr the same, and better opportu-
nities, exists In poverty and obscurity.
No man can win success who Is suffering
from an Irritating: and nerve racking dis-
ease and the man who has the qualities
of success within him, would be Quick
to recognize this fact and seize the best
remedy to eradicate the trouble.
A person afflicted with a serious case
of hemorrhoids or piles Is handicapped
In the race for power and advancement.
It Is Impossible to concentrate the men-
tal energies when this dreadful trouble
is sapping the vital forces. To show
how easily this success destroying
trouble can be overcome, we publish the
following letter from a prominent Indi-
ana man:
"When I received the former letter
and booklet on 'Piles, their nature, cause
and cure/ I was In a critical condition:
ulcers to the number of seven had
formed on the Inside of the rectum, cul-
minating in a large tumor on the out-
side resembling fistula. I suffered the
most excruciating pain, could get no rest
day or night. After reading the booklet
I sent to my druggist but he happened
to be out of Pyramid Pile Cure just at
that time. However, I obtained a part
of -a. box from my brother-in-law and
began their use. Five pyramids com-
pletely cured me. I procured a . box
later, but have had no occasion to use
them. I have been waiting to see that
the cure was permanent, before writing
you of its success. I believe Pyramid
Pile Cure to be the greatest and best pilo
cure on the market and ask you to
please accept of my grateful thanks for
this Invaluable remedy. I take great
pleasure in recommending Its use to any
sufferer along this line. You may use
my name If you wish for reference to
any one afflicted with this disease." J.

ROBINSON PUBLISHING QO. t 24 North William Street. Nerr York Cltj.OGDEN. Utah, Nov. 7.â John Coffin,
aged 26, was stabbfd and instantly killed
last night at Huntsville. fifteen miles east
of this city, by Chris Peterson, a young
man of the same age. Two weeks ago
Coffin was arrested on a charge of embez
zlement by Sylvester Crow, father-in-law
of Peterson. At the trial Coffin was dis
charged, as the accusation was found to
be baseless. There has been ill-feeling
since, ending in a quarrel and fight last
night, during which Peterson seized a
knife and stabbed Coffin. Peterson was
arrested and brought to the County Jail
at Ogden this morning.

SEATTLE, Nov. 7.â A special to the
Post-Intelligencer from Skagway, Alaska,
says: The most hotly contested political
battle ever fought In Alaska is now In
progress for the control of the Repub
lican convention which will convene at
Juneau next Tuesday. The contest is
largely centering around the issue of Ter
ritorial government, and is made all the
more bitter on account of the farcical
non-political convention held last week
at Juneau.
The primary at Juneau was conducted
amid scenes of disorder almost amounting
to rioting and the Territorialists were vic
torious, winning by a plurality of thirty.
Skagway, Halnes, Porcupine and other
Lynn canal points were carried by the
Territorialists, and the cannery vote will
be cast with them.

As the balloon started up Andress was
caught in the ropes. The aeronaut, realiz
ing the danger to both, called to Andress #
to drop, but the latter could not extri
cate himself until the balloon was fifty
feet in the air. He then fell foremost,
striking the ground near the spot from
which the balloon had ascended. 1 His
arms were broken at the wrist and he |
was badly bruised. Physicians say he
will live if he is not injured Internally.
After Andress fell Williams ascended

The semi-final round of the Scottish
bowling tournament was completed on the
Golden Gate Park rinks yesterday after
noon. The only tournament match played
was that between James Gray and J.
McLachlan. Gray won rather easily, and
as a result will meet J. C. Moffatt next
Saturday in the finals. Gray led all the
wiy and beat his opponent 21 to 11.
A special practice match tetweea four
crack players was by far the best ever
played on the park green. The contest
ants were Thomas . McNaught and W.
Stewart on one side and John McLaren
and T. G. Aiken on the other. The score
of 21 to 20 and the fact that at no stage
of the game did one team lead by more
than one point shows what a great con
test it was. Another remarkable feature
was the fact that In the fcrty-one ends

An inveterate cigarette-smoker, who
lives in the little town of Cayes (Seine-et
Marne), declares, according to Le Jour
nal, that during the last thirty years he
has smoked so many cigarettes that if
placed end to end they would cover thlrtv
kilometers-wiearly twenty-three miles He
reckons that during that period hehaa
consumed 800.000 cigarettes, or, roushlv
speaking eighty per day. The strange
thing is that this veteran smoker has re
cently given up this habit in obedience to
the doctors, and he finds himself none the
worse for the change."
The London Westminster Gazette
records the remarkable record of a
Frenchman^ for cigarette smokinc It
says: - .- l
Still Lives.
DURING the municipal election on Tuesday last there was made a practical test of a voting-,
machine which proved to be eminently satisfactory. The -machine was installed in a special
booth on Hyde street, near the City Hall, and during the day 5 76, voters showed their interest
in the test by registering sample ballots therein. At the close of the polls the record was taken
from the machine and was in the hands of Registrar Walsh within five minutes of the hour when the
day's voting was suspended. â¢ :
This test and others which have been made in Eastern cities demonstrate the fact that it is
time for the registration of votes to be made through mechanical means. By the voting machine the
cumbersome system of counting and counter-checking of ballots by a corps of inspectors and party
tally-keepers would be greatly sifnp'if.ed. The possibility of fraud would be minimized. The time now
spent in counting ballots at the booths and in footing up the totals in the Registrar's office would be
cut down two-third?.
The evils of marked ballots and of erroneously scored ballots; which now give rise to so much
confusion and partisan, strife at every election, could be absolutely eliminated by the use of a machine.
Even the illiterate citizen who persists in stamping his slip of paper by something which cannot be con
strued into an X and who therefore loses his chance to register his political; wishes must be credited
with the modicum of intelligence sufficient to enable him to push a button on a voting machine.
The fact that more votes were registered on the machine used for a trial on Tuesday than were
cast in any precinct in the city .shows that the people are interested in the experiment. All that is now
needed to make our elections things of mechanical speediness and precision iÂ§ for the voters to come for
ward and demand that the voting machine be made the medium for the registration of votes in
the future. " " .

â¢ A writer In the current Harper's Week
ly calls attention to some interesting
facts which have recently been brought to
light regarding the comparative per cap
ita consumption of alcoholic beverages in
various countries. France, it appears,
bears off the palm, with a record of 13 1-3
litres (a litre is a little more than a
quart) per year; Switzerland consumes
13^ litres; Italy and Denmark, 10 litres
each; England. Germany and Austria, 9;
Holland, 6; the United States, 5, and
Canada, 2. There may be hope for
France's future, though, for England,
where there Is a special effort now to re
strict the indulgence of the drunken, has
in twenty-five years reduced her annual
per capita allowance from 10 litres to 9
The great trouble at present in France
seems to be that the Government is not
strong enough to restrict the manufacture
and sale of liquors.- There are very nearly
half a million wine shops in France, and
last year, in spite of repressive legisla
tion, there were 1,137,328 private distillers
who made alcohol or brandy from their
own produce for their own use.
What the World Drinks.
CALIFORNIA is arranging- for an exhibit of forest resources at St. Louis. What rivalry we
may expect to meet there is set forth in this item of information in Harper's Weekly: "When
Columbus discovered America there stood in a remote mountain gorge in Cherokee County,
North Carolina, a tulip poplar tree that -<vas then 400 years old. For four more centuries it
grew and fiOiirished, and was recently felled for exhibition at the St. Louis World's Fair. The tree
was thirteen feet in diameter at the base when it was cut. The gorge in which it grew was' so inacces
sible, being forty miles from a railroad, that it was impracticable* to obtain a section near the base.
Forty feet up, where the tree was a little more than six feet in diameter, a disk was cut. This has been
polished and will occupy a place in front of the hunters' lodge. On the polished disk have been engraved
the important historical events of the old north State from the time that Sir Walter Raleigh took posses
sion of the land in his sovereign's name on July 4. 1584, through the colonial days, during the revolu
tion and up to the present time. Another section of the tree will stand like a monument in the forestry
exhibit. It is ten feet high. A portion has been dressed, polished and varnished, while the lower portion
is covered with bark.* ?
This induces a smile. A tree thirteen feet in diameter is a sapling compared to the sequoia and
sugar pine arid Douglass spruce of this State. As for history, we have trees the record of whose annual
rings will show them older than the species of the North Carolina tulip. Though their diameter ex
ceeds forty feet, a disk cut from them is hardly largo enough to have inscribed the history that has passed
since their life began. Nineveh and Babylon were Assyrian capitals then. They were growing before the
Patriarchs, before Egypt was, before the Greek commonwealth rose. They show scars made by the lava
streams that flowed from volcanoes that lit up the inland sea whose tides rose and fell in the SanJ
Joaquin Valley. They are contemporary with geological periods, and prehistoric animals now long ex-j
tinct snuggled in their shade, the Elphas primogeni us scratched himself against their bark, and the hard
headed Bos primogenius bellowed around them and butted his head against their columns.
In their time new stars have blazed in the heavenly constellations, lived for. ages and faded away.
Since their evergreen branches sheltered birds now extinct as the dodo, great languages, spoken by mil
lions; have come into being, have been the vehicle of vast literatures, have died and are forgotten. Com-:
pared with them that North Carolina tree is a sprout of yesterday. One of these trees f educed to lumber
will furnish boards and joists to build a whole town as large as the average town of North Carolina, witlv
all its buildings, public and private. Talk of timber! When tall and large trees are wanted, nearly as old \
as the world since it got hard enough to bear timber, come to California. j
The professor recommends the foothills
a few miles from the coast of Southern
California for some. Others he directs to
the high Sierras. Still others are toid to
go to sea. The master of meteorological
phenomena is incidentally a student of
hygiene and he tells his patients what
varieties of food will win half the battle.
He is also able to supply accurate Infor
mation as to the expense attendant upon
any of the various trips recommended.
The functions of the Weather Bureau
are known to bQ. numerous and diverse,
but surely the sapient founders of the
great institution would never have
dreamed that its sphere of usefulness
would extend so far as to become a court
of last appeal for consumptives. Never
theless Professor McAdle. who observes
astronomic, atmospheric and terrestrial
phenomena from the tenth floor of the
Mills building, is besieged with prayers
for assistance from friends of sufferers
from various pulmonary troubles.
Grave-faced fathers, weeping mothers
and Krief -stricken brothers and sisters
come constantly to ask him where loved
ones whose lives are gradually fading
away may be sent with the possibility
that they may recover. One desires to
know if the mountain air will revivify
his son, another if a voyage over the seas
will give a new lease of life to a patient.
Sad Duties of Prophet.
A TIMBER RIVAL.
One of the most characteristic oÂ£ these
strange tradesmen i3 the dog barber. Tha
favorite dog of the Parisian is the French
poodle, or "mouton," as he Is popularly
called. It Is chiefly for his benefit that
the dog barber exists. His headquarters
are the banks of the Seine. Here the.
main body can be found at all times,
though in the summer some go about tho
city carrying on their occupation from
house to house. In the hot days one con
tinually hears the long drawn out cry,
"To-o-odeur de chiens!" and meets tho
familiar figure of the dog barber, with
his box of instruments slung over hi3
shoulder. Many of them have their reg
ular customers, whose houses they visit
at stated Intervals to make the toilet of
these privileged poodlesâ for the. Paris
mouton is the "spoiled child" among
dogs. He is clipped, brushed, combed,
perfumed and generally has his topknot
fastened with a pink or blue ribbon.
Some even wear gold or silver bracelets
around one Daw.
The result has been the development of
the dog barber as an artist. He clips and
shaves his customers' dogs In most elab
orate fashion. Some are left shaggy
manes, with a tuft at the end of their
tail, to Imitate a lion. Others, again, aro
clipped In stripes, making them look like
black zebras, and others have their faces
clipped, and nothing but a pair of fierce
mustaches left with fluffy bracelets of
hair round each foot. At any time of the
day. as lq^ng as daylight lasts, the dog
barber will be found at work on the Seine
embankment^ Seated on a camp stool,
and generally surrounded by an admiring
crowd, he clips and shaves according to
the directions given him by the owner.
The banks of the Seine have been select
ed for his operation because the river Is
handy to bathe the animal after he has
been clipped and combed.
It is astonishing with what zeal every
means of earning an honest penny la
plied In Paris. No city in the world has
bo many queer little trades by which
those practicing them scrape together
enough sous to make a living. The king
of this class is, of course, the ragpicker.
He starts out before dawn armed with a
lanetrn and a long hooked piece of iron
and explores the rubbish boxes placed
outside every door In the capital before
the municipal carts come to carry off
their contents. Then there is the man
who goes around with the spiked stick
picking up the cigar and cigarette stumps
which lie around the Paris cafes. There
are men. too, who search the streets for
fallen money and who generally find
enough to keep them from starvation.

that I ever saw or heard of. He was a
German, and every time I hear of a jury
I think of him and take off my hat."
"It was a "framed" jury. You know
that means that some of the jurymen
have been 'reached* and were ready to
render a verdict of not guilty at any
stage of the game. The German was one
of the 'framed' and he knew for a cer
tainty that another one of the twelve was
prepared to give a verdict like his own.
Well, the Jury went out about 11:30 on
the second day of the trial. They delib
erated for about an hour and then one of
the Jurors, the professional kind, who
always likes to get his meals at the ex
pense of the litigants, suggested lunch.
"They had their lunch and returned and
about 3:30 announced that a verdict was
ready. It was not guilty, of course, and
as socn as it had been reported to the
court and the prisoner discharged the
young man who had been on trial rushed
up to my German friend and throwing
his arms about his neck thanked him in
a most fulsome manner, 'You are all right,
Nick,' said he, with a hug; 'that's what
you are.'

Sword-fishing, as managed off Block
Island in those days was done somewhat
on this style:
When a s-wordfish was sighted a sort of
harpoon was thrown at him. It stuck in
his body and he usually dived or else
made off at a terrific rate. To the har
poon was attached a long coil of light
rope, the other end of which was tied to
a keg. This keg was watertight and large
end was tossed overboard as soon as the
fish was speared.
Away would dash the fish, dragging th^
keg after him. The boat would follow in
the wake of the keg. At times when the
iish dlvtd deep he would pull the keg
clear under water. But its buoyancy al
ways brought It up again and the fish
with !L Or the keg would sweep along
the surface, as if impelled by electricity,
casting up great clouds of spray and Im
peding the fish's progress. Finally the
great quarry would tire of the race and
would fall an easy victim to the men in
the boat. The only real element of dan
* ger came In those unusual instances when
the maddened brute somehow connected
the boat with his misfortunes and at
tacked it. Then, if he was big, a lively
fight was likely to ensue.

As we tacked out of the quaint old har

It was off Block Island, as I said, that
the story bepins. Four or live of usâ good

drowsy weeks in that treeless lotus land,
the island whose sole claim to modernity
is a "street" railroad with a rolling stock
of two antiquated horse cars.
We were all New Yorkers, busy men
and busier society women, and the restful
old-world sleepiness of the little island
had lured us to prolong our stay beyond
Its original bounds. And therein lay ali
the trouble that crowded aiier.
For two weeks we roamed about the

The clerk, slightly puzzled, stood on

valued privilege of smoking In the yard,

Now the noontime smoke of a certain
clerk in the storehouse was something
that he felt he could not do without.
Therefore as soon as McCalla's order was
posted up he hied himself to the admin

to appear was readily granted him and
he entered McCalla's office. Â¦ He intro

McCalla's Discipline.
That was written in 1808, ninety-five years ago. The last clause was rather a flattering ascrip
tion to the Spanish King than a statement of fact, for the narrow policy of Spain continued up to the
time that she lost her continental posssssions in this hemisphere. That policy has -descended as a tradi
tion and a habit to the Latin-Americans who dominate her former territory, and it became recrudescent
in the attitude of Colombia in refusing to ratify the canal treaty made by Mr. Hay and Senor Herran.
Polk made the treaty of 1846 with Xew- Granada as a foundation for a canal policy, and American
statesmanship has patiently sought to induce the foolish successors to the foolish policy of Spain to
consent to the use of the isthmus for the great purpose to which it seemed dedicated by nature. There
fore the events of the past week are the most important that the world has yet seen, in respect to the
change they promise to effect in the commercial geography of the planet. The Call, originally, and first
among American newspapers; indicated and predicted that our Government intended to adopt the Pan
ama route. When the treaty failed three months ago we foresaw this revolution. Our Government has
seen the opportunity and has promptly taken advantage of it. The administration has notified Bogota
and Panama that they must make ''peaceable settlement" of their differences. Marroquin and the pro
visional government both know that this means permanent independence for Panama and the speedy
.construction of the canal. â¢ % â¢
Notwithstanding the adverse views of Senator Morgan, we have acted strictly within our rights.
His assumption that recognition of the new republic is a matter for Congress to decide is a mistake. It
is a matter for the executive solely. The constitution says the President shall receive foreign Ministers.
When the Spanish colonies that now make up the Latin-American states became independent President
Monroe settled that right of recognition as an executive prerogative, and that settlement has never been
disturbed. The President, either in the session or recess of Congress, can receive the Minister from :
Panama, and that is the recognition of the new state.
seductive nature. They will draw sooner or later the masters of the ocean to a point of the globe des
tined by nature to change the face of the commercial system of nations. The time is past when Spain,
through a jealous policy, refused to other nations a thoroughfare through the possession of which she
has so long kept the world in ignorance." fj
THE event of the week is the bloodless revolution by which the new state of Panama prepares
to become a member of the family of nations. She is a small member, it is true, but in some
respects promises to enjoy elements of importance which many larger may envy.
From the time that the isthmus uniting North arid South America became known to
explorers and geographers, that part of it that now seems sure to an independent state has been re
garded by the far-sighted as one of the most important pieces of land on the planet, because some day
it would be traversed by a waterway carrying the world's commerce between the two oceans. Paterson,
the Scotchman who founded the Bank of England, had that view of the isthmus country as a whole,"
and sought by his Darien scheme to locate there a state which, by controlling the short transit of com
merce, would dictate to the trade of the world.
Spain, when she owned all that territory, as part of the empire of Philip II upon which he!
boasted that the sun never set, took a narrow view of the splendid possibilities that the isthmus pre-i
sented. In 1788 Jefferson wrote from Paris to Mr. William Carmichael "at Madrid : "With respect to!
the Isthmus of Panama 1 am assured by Burgoin that a survey was made ; that a canal was practi- j
cable; and that the idea was abandoned for political reasons altogether. Pie has seen and minutely j
examined the report. This project is to me a vast desideratum, for reasons political and philosophical/''}
That was one hundred and fifteen years ago, when Spain was one of the strongest of the powers, and ;
had the resources to have immediately begun and speedily finished the great work. Spain sought rather j
to conceal the capabilities of the isthmus, and neglected the conquest of the Indian .tribes that inhabited j
it, preferring to leave them as ffn obstruction to exploration.
Humboldt attempted to impress the Spanish Government with the importance of the prize it
held in the sovereignty of that territory, and. addressing Charles IV. said : "Moreover, no political con- !
sideration should oppose the progress of population, agriculture, commerce and civilization, in the:
Isthmus of Panama. The more this neck of land shall- be cultivated the more resistance will it oppose
to the enemies of Spain. If any enterprising nation wished to become possessed of the isthmus it could
do so with the greatest ease at present, when good and numerous fortifications are destitute of the arms;
to defend them. The whale and cachalot fisheries, which drew in 1803 sixty English vessels to the South
Seas, and the facilities for the Chinese commerce and the furs of Nootka Sound, are baits of a vervi
Three years ago I landed at a South-
Etreet pier from a Florida sea trip. It
was late when the boat got Into her New
York dock. I could not get a cab, so de
cided to walk across that somewhat slum
ridden section of town to Broadway. .
It was Saturday night and South street
was alive with sailor folk and market
ers. As I turned off into the first Hide
street the gloom of the ill-lighted, half
deserted thoroughfare showed all the
more darkly by contrast to the gayly
illumined water front I had just quit.
"Trouble you for a light, sir?' asked
a voice at my elbow. Rough as the tones
were, with the harshness born of years
before the mast, the intonations were
those or a gentleman. I eyed the roughly
dressed man who had accosted me with
more than ordinary Interest for this rea
son as I held out my cigar to him. . He
tried In vain to light his short pipe from
It, and meantime I tried In the dim light
tc make out more of his figure, which
somehow struck me as familiar.
"Try a match," I suggested at last, of
fering him one. He thanked me, struck

blaze from the wind with both hands

For hours, In that awful fog. we cruised
about, now scanning the wate-rs within
the narrow mist ring until our ryes
ached; now 6houting ourselves hearse in
the faint hope of getting some response
from the missing man. Mrs. Solliday
went from one violent fit of hysterics to
another. I think, remembering her last
words to* her husband, we none of us
pitied her as we should have done.
At last the sun burned up the mist and
the face of the waters grew visible once
more. But no sign of the missing man.
Nor was his body ever cast upon any
beach.
Two years later his widow married Pen
fleld. and a charmingly well matched
couple they were. So said the world in

one who hazard* d a fearful If secret

"Knocked on the head most likely,"
suggested the captain. "Hit his head
against the side of the boat as hÂ« fe!l."
"Tumbled overboard same time I did,

tain. "We'll cruise around and see if we
can't pick him up."
"He could hardly have drowned." said
I. "Phil was one of the finest swimmers
I ever knew."
Solliday was not in the boat!
We glanced about from face to face.
Then from every throat went up a simul
taneous cry:
"Solliday!"
"All right?" he yelled at list, when he
could free his mouth and throat from sÂ°a
water. "All here-? "Was I the only one

quickly aboard. The confusion that

and stomach.
"There is r.o danger." he was beginning,
when she broke in with a shudder:
The mist (as every woman who reads
this will understand) took the curl out of
Mrs. Solliday's hair. It hung in strings
down her fact. Also the choppy motion
oi the fog-blankeud seas did not improve
her looks cr her temper.
"Are you nervous, dear?" murmured
Phil, sitting down beside her as she cast
a troubled look about. He was steadying
himself by holding one hand on the gun
wale. It was his right hand. To soothe
her he laid his maimed left handâ twisted
and misshapen like some hideous birds

Superintendent Noble has been engaged
In active railroad Bervlce since 1862, when
he began his career as a messenger on
the Pennsylvania Railway. From this
modest position he rapidly rose to tele
graph operator and train dispatcher and
then to that of superintendent," leaving
the Texas and Pacific in 1886 to . take
charge of the Central Pacific operating
department at Dunsmuir. In March, 1898,
he was made superintendent of the Salt
Lake division of the Southern Pacific and
has since performed his duties at Ogden
in a creditable manner.
A circular issued from the office of
Manager James Agler of the Southern
Pacific Company yesterday announces
the resignation of J. S. Noble, superin
tendent of the Salt Lake division, with
headquarters at Ogden. W. R. Scott, as
sistant superintendent of the Sacramen
to division, is named as Noble's succes
sor and H. B. Breckenfeld of the Sacra
mento office will take the place vacated
by Scott.
The resignation of Superintendent No
ble has been expected for some time, he
having on several occasions intimated to
his friends that he was tiring of the re
sponsibilities of his position and was anx
ious to engage in private enterprises. A
few months ago he spent several days in
this city and it was then reported that
he had signified to General Manager
Kruttschnltt his determination to resign,
but Was asked to remain in his position
until the end of the year. Noble's resig
nation and the changes that result from'
it will take effect on November 15.

them by the Fire Commissioners.
Agent Hazen informed the representa

by them he would make complaint against
the firm in the Federal court on a charge
of aiding and abetting the false imper

session of a vagrant named H. Hoover,
alias Henry Greshham, alias O'Brien, ar
rested in Chlco last Thursday. He had
obtained the badge from a lad named
Kruse, a deserter from the training ship
at Yerba Buena Island. As there was no
evidence that Hoover had obtained money
or credit on the star, Agent Hazen could
not tile a complaint against him.

I barber, ' had secured his tools from a
>hop on-Seoond street in. which hie was
employed and left on an early morning
.rain, still having his young son j in his
ceeplng.' Immediately circulars were sent
>ut to the various chiefs of police 'and
Sheriffs on the Pacific slope by Captain of
Detectives Martin and a reward offered
lor the apprehension of the pair. Nothing
was heard of them until yesterday," when
he telegram announcing their arrest in
Portland arrived.
The police of this city have been noti
fied, of the arrest yesterday of William
Wolfson and Fanny Ruloff in Portland,
Or. Both are wanted on serious charges
and jumped their' bail during the latter
part of last month. An officer will; prob
ably leave thlj city to-day to bring the
fugitives back. . ':'..'.
Mrs. Bertha Wolfson, wife of one of the
prisoners, is In this city from, Boston,
Mass.. and is prosecuting the .charges
through her attorney. A. A.- Friedlander.
Mrs. Wolfson alleges that her. marriage .to
the defendant occurred nine years ago
and that he deserted her three years ago
in the East, taking their Â¦ 6-year-old â¢' son
with him. She heard nothing more of him
until about seven ' months ago, ' wllen he'
came to Â£>ong Branch, Cal., and met thÂ«
woman who is now under arrest with
him. This woman was being supported
by a man mimed Max Sauls, Mrs. Wolfson
alleges, and Wolfson availed himself of
Sauls', absence In Seattle to win the af
fections of his mistress. Just previous to
their separation Mrs. - Wolfson had her
husband arrested In Boston for brutal
treatment, but he Jumped- his. bonds on
this charge and came West.
Wolfson and the woman- came to San
Francisco, and Sauls on his trip back
from Seattle met them here. Considerable
trouble followed and the Ruloff woman
had Sauls arrested on a charge of having
Btolen about 11000 worth of Jewelry. Noth
ing, however, was done, with the case, but
Sauls left the city. Then Attorney Frled :
lander brought Mrs. Wolfson to the coast
with her two small- children, and she
swore to a warrant charging her hus
band with failure to provide for a minor
child. The wife and babies were destitute
and are still living. wholly on the charity
of friends. Later another charge was \
placed against I the man, and his consort
was also- taken into custody.
On October 24, when the case was called.
It was found that both had jumped their
bonds and left the city. Wolfson, who is

The Board of Public "Works yesterday
referred to the City Attorney for a legal
opinion the petition of the Realty Im
provement Company for permission to
open Devisadero street through private
property from Duboce avenue, formerly
Thirteenth street, to Fourteenth street.
It is the desire of the company to deed
to the city a strip of land forty-eight feet
wide in the block bounded by Duboce ave
nue and Fourteenth, Alpine and Castro
streets, with the object of having the city
declare the land so deeded an open pub
lic street for the extension of Devisadero
City' Engineer Grunsky investigated the
petition and reported to the Board of
Public Works that the opening of the
street was a desirable improvement in
every detail, and he recommended that
favorable action be taken on the petition.
The Board of Public Works was con
fronted with an obstacle in ordering the
opening of the street owing to a charter
provision that no street can be dedicated
for public use unless it Is at least 200 feet
away from the nearest parallel street.
The street designed to be opened was
found to be only 180 feet from Castro
street, and therefore the board is prohib
ited, from taking favorable action. How
ever, the board referred the matter to the
City Attorney for his advice as to.wheth
er the charter provision is binding in the
premises.

, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the most
successful and most widely known of
any > remedy ', for .stomach , troubles be-
cause it is the most reasonable and sci-
entific of raodernvmedicines.
I Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets â¢ are sold
by every druggist in the '.United States
and. Canada as .well as in. Great Britain,
at 50 cents for complete treatment.-, -
Nothing 1 further is -.- required to cure
any. stomach trouble or to . make thin,
nervous "dyspeptic ' people, -strong,' plump
and well. 'â¢/. 'Â¦''', . .- . Â¦>
If such persons would lay their preju-
dices aside and make a regular practice
of taking, after each meal, one or two
of . Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets the food
would be quickly and thoroughly digest-
ed, because these tablets contain the
natural peptones and diastase which
every weak stomach lacks, and by sup-
plying this want' the stomach is soon
enabled to reach its natural tone and
vigor.
Stuart's ' Dyspepsia Tablets digest
every form of flesh forming food, meat,
eggs,' bread and potatoes, and this is the
reason : they so quickly build up,
strengthen and invigorate thin, dyspep-
tic men, women and children.
But the trouble is that while we eat
enough . and generally- too much, the
stomach, from abuse and overwork, does
not! properly digest and assimilate it,
which is the reason so many people re-
main thin and under weight; the digest-
ive organs do not completely digest the
food forming beefsteak and eggs and
similar wholesome food.
There are thousands of such who are
really confirmed dyspeptics, although
they may have no particular pain or 'in-
convenience from their stomachs.
Common aenao would suggest that if
one wishes to -become fleshy and plump
It can only result from the food we eat
and digest and that food should be al-
buminous or flesh forming food, like
eggs, beefsteak, and cereals; In other
words the kinds of food that make flesh
are the foods which form the greater
part of our daily bills of fare.

Value to Thousands. *Â¦; i â¢

The Columbian Banking Company has
been very successful as a. business ven
ture. The profits are reported to be some
thing like $50,000 per annum. The capital
and surplus are figured at $100,000.
marriage the third husband shot himself
In a New York hotel.
A disagreement hsft taken place among
the directors of the Columbian Banking
Company over a proposed issue of 500
shares of treasury stock of the company.
This has led to the filing in the Superior
Court of a petition for an Injunction to
restrain the majority of the board of di
rectors from carrying out the stock issue.
At a meeting of the board of directors
last Wednesday a motion was carried
that authorized putting the 500 shares of
stock on the market. In a few minutes
the vote was followed by a distribution
of the stock that had been voted and it
was all taken. At least the minutes of
the bank will probably so show. The
majority of the members of the
board had the power to adopt
the resolution. The minority of
the board, consisting of President I. J.
Truman and Vice President Turpin, took
the view that the action was illegal, in
asmuch as it had been taken without se
curing the assent of the stockholders in
the banking company. Messrs. Truman
and Turpin, as soon as the meeting of
the board was ended, proceeded to have
filed a petition for an injunction. Notice
was served on the majority of the. board
of directors early the next morning.
Since then there have been uo moves, the
directors of both parties awaiting the ac
tion of the Superior Court.
The purpose in voting the issue of 500
shares of treasury stock was to give the
present minority stockholders -control of
the affairs of the banking company. Al
th-ugh Messrs. Truman and Turpin are
a minority in the board of directors, they
together hold more than one-half of the
stock that has been issued. They are the
possessors of 1339 sares. The other stock
issued amounts to 1156 shares in all. The
remainder of the stock authorized by the
articles of incorporation is still treasury
stock. This explains the application for
an injunction. While Messrs. Truman
and Turpin cannot get any vote through
the board of directors as a minority, they
still are in control by holding the major
ity of the issued stock. The other direc
tors are J. Audrey Sadler, W. J. Bartnett
C. O. Perry, James Swift and Allen Grif
fith. The cashier of the bank Is C O
Perry, and the injunction is aimed at
him.
Daring Motorist Is
Wildly Cheered
by Crowd.
AN OPEN event for cars of six and
a half horse power and under intro
duced the motorists yesterday at
Ingleside race track. There were
four starters and it. turned out almost a
practice spin for the .White car operated
by W. Grothe. The Oldsmobile, driven
by W. 8. Hunt, finished second and W.
H. Kellogg on his Buckboard, which
twice finished third on Friday, again
got the show.
Under" the rules governing the five
milÂ© race which followed, gasoline cars
only, 1200 prfunds and" under, were al
lowed to compete. In this W. F. Win
chester, driving a Franklin, enjoyed quite
as easy a thing of ; it as did the White
car in the race preceding.. It was a
processional affair, â¢ the Franklin winning
all alone in 7:53 1-5. The announced time
for the Franklin operated by R. Fowler,
and which finished; second, was 9:54 4-5,
though this looked like an error on the
part of the "dockers." C. S. Luckhardt
and his Rambler took third position
crossing the tape. F. R. Luckhardt and
hi3 St. John machine had a misunder
standing and withdrew the first mile.
O. A. McNabb and his Cadellac did not
finish. i .Â¦.'. :â¢Â¦?- - _.r^
Thomas A. White, who captured the
race for motor cycles with his Rambler
on Friday, also annexed the same event
yesterday, the distance again being five
miles. He started with a time allowance
of ten seconds, and finished a clever
winner in 8:01 3-5 over the scratch man,
E. M. Coffin, on a Duck machine, whose
time was 8:03. Third prize went* to A. H.
Sampson,
There was genuine enthusiasm when,
the five-mile event for cars 1S00 pounds
and under, was called, for Barney Old
field made his first appearance of the
day, seated in his "Baby Bullet No. 3."
The champion made no bones about going
out and, making the pace for other com
petitors when, Jack Gleason dropped his
red bunting, and that is all 'there was to
it. Oldfield finished first in 5:41 4-5. Then
followed at ' stated intervals Pierre
Desmet with his big, blustering, sputter
ing Mors ! Jn 6:31 4-5, and W. Grothe,
driving a White steamer, in 6:53. W. F.
Winchester's Franklin dropped out in the
fourth mile. ,' â¢
SATJNDEBS SETS THE PACE.
Quite in the. same^ fashlon^dld ' W. E.

Mrs. Krzyzanowski had a most ro
mantic history, according to De Golia.
Â£he was born in Polish Russia and claim
ed to have been of noble birth. Her first
husband was a Russian officer, who was
arrested for conspiracy against the Gov
ernment, and was shot while trying to
escape. Her second husband was a dis
solute Russian officer, who dissipated
most of his wife's fortune and then killed
himself. She traveled over Europe with
her two children, both of whom died In
Paris. In the early eighties she came to
can Francisco. Here she was married to
General Krzyzanowbkl, who bad com
manded a brigade In the Civil ."War, and
was then engaged in running a' combina
tion ealoon and cigar store on Montgom
ery street. They went to New York for
their honeymoon and eight days after, tbe
On October 17 another contest was filed
by Darwin C. de Golia and Charles J.
Pence on behalf of Aioyzy Sylvester Bor
kowski, who claimed to be a nephew of
the dead woman and wanted her money.
His attorneys say he is a resident of Si
lesia. Austria, and a son of the decedent's
brother. The contest of the alleged son
had never been pressed, but this new con
test seemed to alarm Gantner & Guntz,
the undertakers who had buried the de
cedent, and who up to this time had not
presented their bill. On October IS they
filed a. bill with the executor for $1332 for
expenses 'connected with the burial, of
which $1300 was approved by Executor
Rickman, and an order for that amount
allowed by Judge Trout. One of the Items
Â¦was J3000 for a casket.
Darwin C. de Golia, one of the attorneys
for the latest contestant, admitted yes
terday that he Intended filing a petition
Monday which would embrace the above
facts as set forth in the records of the
case, and would ask that further inroads
on the funds of the estate be prevented
until their client had a chance to present
his claims for possession of the money
left by his alleged aunt. If e^ criticized
severely the methods adopted by Rick
rnan and his attorney, George II. Perry,
in practically dii'idingr a large portion of
the estate before any chance had been
STlven for the matter to be fully adjudi
cated. He claimed that the withdrawal
of all money from the funds of the es
tate had been entirely Irregular and
charged that an effort was being made
to dissipate the funds to forestall the
claims of his client. He said the coming
petition would embody these charges.
BOMANTIC CABEEB.
OOT3 MOBE CLAIMANT.
Th^ contest disposed of. the will was
admitted to probate. Rickman, the lega
tee, who had assigned his interests in the
estate to his attorney, George H. Perry-,
was appointed executor by Judge Troutt
to replace the special administrator, A. L.
Coulton, who had been appointed pending
the contest. The estate, consisting of
money in the Hibcmia Bank and the San
Francisco Savir.gs Union, remained In the
depositories until the contest was settled,
subject to the order of the court.
On July 2S James g. Maguire filed no
tice of contest to the will as attorney for
Joseph Krzyzanowski. an alleged son of
the decedent. The return on the service
of tne notice shows that it was served
on George H. Perry, attorney for Rick
man, on July 27. On the following day.
however, notwithstanding the notice of
contest. Perry presented to Judge Trout
an order for the transfer of $11,000 of the
funds of the estate to Rickman, who was
serving as executor without bonds. This
order was granted on the same day the
new contest was filed and the money
passed Into the hands of Rickman. The
records do not show that at that time
there had been any order for a partial
distribution of the estate, "-.â¢ ' \-
ANOTHER CONTEST FILED.
Sensational developments are more than
likely to follow a petition which v.ill be
filed to-morrow in Judge Troutt's court.
In the matter of the estate of Palagia
Krzyzanowski, an eld woman who died in
this city February 1 of this year, leaving
an estate valued approximately at $25,000.
After a her death a will was produced be
queathing her entire estate to one Charles
Rickman, who, although no relative of the
decedent, was said to be a warm friend
of hers. The will expressly stated that
the iestator died without natural heirs.
Shortly after the production of the will
a contest was filed on behalf of Marie
Nightengale, an alleged daughter of the
decedent, by Nagle & Nagle, her attor
neys, alleging various causes for setting
aside the instrument and giving the estate
to the contestant. As the hearing- pro
gressed it was evident that the contestant
was making out a decidedly weak case.
Reputable witnesses testified that she was
the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Nighten
gale, who ran a public house at one time
on the San Bruno road, and as such suc
ceeded to their property at their deaths.
Other equally strong testimony was in
troduced attacking the claims of the con
testant, and it was generally supposed
that she had prosecuted a hopeless case.
Bt-fore the hearing vras completed, how
over, to the surprise of every one, a stip
ulation was fiifu whereby Charles Rick
man, the btm-Sciary under the alleged
?.ill. agreed to pay Miss Nightengale
$10,000 to dismiss the contest. At the time
it was understood that she was to receive
SSÂ«* and Nagle & Nagle $5'XÂ«) of the
money when It should be paid.

Letson Balliet, whose mall was stopped
by a fraud order issued by the Postmas
ter General on October 10, filed a com
plaint in equity yesterday in the United
States Circuit Court through his attor
ney, Bert Schleslnger. asking that W. W.
Montague, postmaster at San Francisco,
be enjoined from holdlng^his mail and
that he be required to surrender to Bal
llet all the mall now withheld by him.
The complaint is entitled the White
Swan Mines Company, Limited, against
W. W. Montague. It sets forth that Bal
llet is engages in the business of raining
for gold, that' he owns and manages the
White Swan group of mines, twelve mile*
east of Baker City, Or. The complaint
recites further that the mining company
was incorporated for $1,250,000 capital
stock divided into 1,230.000 shares of the
par value of $1 each, and having as its
board of directors Letson Balliet, James
E. Henry, T. R. Dawe, J. N. Woodward.
Emmett Callaghan. C. W. Hill, J. H.
Smith, R. A. Coleman and S. B. Hewith.
It is averred that $1,20,000 have been sub
scribed for stock issued to 1343 subscrib
ers and stockholders, of which twenty
five are in California, eleven in Delaware.
100 In Illinois, twenty-five in Indiana, 42^
in Iowa, sixty-one In Kansas, sixteen in
Maine, twenty-seven in Maryland, sixty
three in Massachusetts, fourteen in Mich
igan, forty-nine in Missouri, forty-eight
in Nebraska, eighteen in Minnesota, six
teen in New Jer3ey, sixty-eight in New-
York, thirty-four in Ohio, ninety-five in
Pennsylvania, seventeen in Washington
and fifty in Wisconsin.
CLAIMS DEBT IS SMALL.
It is averred also that only 203 person*
are indebted to the company for stock.
the- largest . account due from any one
stockholder being $70, the total amount
due not exceeding $3000. It is alleged fur
ther that more than $100,000 has been
spent legitimately for developing the min
ing property, that said property is now
of great value and that work upon the"
same has been diligently prosecuted every
day for eighteen months. Â£ * .
The complaint further sets forth that
many tons of pay quartz are new avail
able, ready to be crushed; that the mine
is completely equipped with hoisting
works, quartz mills and other necessary
plant; that the pay roll amounts to "be
tween $2000 and $3000 per month, and that
the ore assays from $5 to $300 per ton.
The allegation is also made that the
mine has produced more than half a mil
lion dollars, and that In September, 1003.
the quartz mill ran for about twenty
days, the- output for that period being
from $3200 to 52300. It is asserted also
that no assessments have ever been lev
ied or contemplated, and that the with
holding of Balllet'a mail under the fraud
order will work him great damage.
CITED TO APPEAR.
Judge Morrow declined to grant the
temporary injunction at this time, but is
sued an order citing Postmaster Monta
gue to appear on November 15 and show
cause why the restraining order should
not be issued. ." : :â>.
. Balllet has been operating in this city
for many years and Is reported to have
realized half a million dollars out of the
sale of stock. He employed 'about eight
een stenographers and had twenty rooms
at 50S California street for his offices. He
advertised largely, principally east of the
Rocky Mountains, and by offering ex
travagantly large dividends did a thriv
ing business until many of his alleged
victims appealed to the postal . authori
ties. Balllet was arrested about a year
ago and taken to Des Moines, Iowa., for
trial on a charge of using the mails with
intent to defraud and was convicted ta
the United States Court in that place. He
took an appeal to the United States Su
preme Court and the appeal is pending.
The fraud order of October 10 is based
upon the fact of Balllet's conviction. V
JUDGE LAWLOR MAKES
AN IMPORTANT RULING
Â¦ On Thursday of next week United
States Court Commissioner Heacock
will render a decision that will be
fraught with the greatest importance to
Chinese manufacturers who have be
lieved that their standing under the
Chinese exclusion act la that of mer
chants. If Judge Heacock. should decide
that manufacturers are not merchants,
but laborers, a sensation will be created
among the Chinese domiciled in all
parts of the United States. The test
case is that of Wong Dy, a Chinese la
borer who recently " arrived from the
salmon canneries in Alaska. He was ar
rested on a charge of being a Chinese
laborer unlawfully in this country, and
being without the certificate of residence
required under the terms of the exclu
sion act. He set up the defense that dur
ing the six months In 1S94 when all the
Chinese laborers were required to obtain
certificates of residence, he was a mem
ber of the Pacific Fruit Packing Com
pany at 801 Stockton street and acted
as foreman.
Judge Heacock, in taking the case
under advisement, said that the issue in
the case was whether a manufacturer
was a merchant or a laborer. It had been
held In . some decisions, he said, that a
Chinese who' sold leaf tobacco was a
merchant, but that a Chinese who
bought leaf tobacco, made it into cigars
and sold them, was not a merchant, but
a manufacturer, ,and that a manufac
turer was a laborer, because the object
of the exclusion.' act was , to | prevent
coolie competition with American labor.
Should Judge Heacock decide that a
manufacturer is a laborer, the Chinese
owners of factories in which are made
shoes, brooms, cigars, tinware, clothing,
overalls, shirts, telothing. etc., of which
there are many in this city, will be liable
to arrest and deportation.
COMPRESSED AIR CLEANING
MACHINES NOT PROHIBITED
If Defendant Is Acquitted, Alleged
Stolen Property Mnst Be Re
turned to Him.
An important ruling was made by Judge
Lawlor yesterday in the case of John
Leftere and Fred Skillman. who were ac
quitted by a Jury in his court on- a charge
of grand larceny. They had been arrest
ed for stealing $400 from Spiro Gionacis.
301 Fourth street, while he was asleep
in his room on the morning of December
13. Gionacis was a bootblack and had
his stand in front of Leftere's restau
rant.
A motion had been made by Leftere"*
attorney that $217 20, which was found in
his pockets when arrested and held as
evidence, should be returned to him. The
Judge made an order that the money be
returned to the police property clerk and
by him handed to Leftere on the ground
that as he had been acquitted of th*
charge he was presumed to occupy the
same status as though he had not been
accused. It was a matter to be litigated
in another tribunal, the Judge held, that
is, if the complaining witness desires to
lay claim to the> money.
Merchants' Association Ascertains
That Other Cities Permit Use of
New System.
The Merchants' Association sent a com
munication yesterday to the Board of Su
pervisors to the effect that after inquiries
in various Eastern cities It has been un
able to find cne city where the use of
compressed air cleaning machines or sand
blast machines Is prohibited on the public
streets. The letter says there seems to
be no good reason why San Francisco
should not permit the public to have t ho
benefit of an improved system of clean
ing. The proposed ordinance prohibiting
such machines will be considered by the
Supervisors at to-morrow's meeting.
t The Merchants* Association also calls
the attention of the board to the pres
ent neglected condition of the city cem
eteries near Point Lobos and asks that
provision be made for their proper main
tenance. .
BARNEY OLDFIELD proved to the
satisfaction of the spectators at
Insleside yesterday that he is eas-
ily the formost chauffeur In the
world. He circled the track, a distance of
one^mile, in the marvelous time of fifty
eight and four-fifth seconds during a ten
mile race, .in which he averaged a mile a
minute. Spectators held .their breath as
they watched the daring motorist navi
gate his 120-horsepower macnlne. He had
the best machines in the world against
him, but he was able to outdistance them
with incredible ease. Oldfield showed he
has nerves of steel. With a cigar clench
ed between his teeth, his steady hands on
the steering wheel, his feet pressing
brakes, and with a demoniac expression
on his face, the . brave and cool-headed
driver went around the track with ter
rific speed. He cut around the corners on
three wheels, and he came within a foot
of the fence on many occasions. He never
eased off his speed, until he had crossed
the tape at the end of the tenth mile,
two miles ahead of his competitors. -His
time for ten miles was 10:19 1-5.
OLDFIELD A' MARVEL.
Oldfield's performance yesterday and on
every day he starts i3 the feature of the
meet. Others may circle the track and
make fast time, but they cannot compare
in daring with the world's champion. He
has proven a great drawing card and add
ed zest to the races, which are being held
under the 'auspices of.. the. Automobile
Club of California. To-day special races
will be held at Insleside in order to give
those who have not had an opportunity
to see Oldfleld travel through space. A
special prize of $100 has been offered by
L. P. Lowe if Oldfield will lower the time
he made yesterday. Barney promises to
go after the American record, and, as tne
track_ will be fast, he believes he will
equal : his record of :55 4-5 for the mile
made on the Empire City track.
The attendance yesterday was a little
less than on' the opening day. This was
due j to the : threatening weather and the
doubt as to whether, the -races would be
held. However, more than 250Q spectators
viewed , the exciting sport. Hundreds ; at

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 7.â Joe Corbett
had a bad day and Oakland batted out a
victory by a narrow margin. Los An
geles started with a rush, landing on
Cooper for five hits in the first Inning,
which netted as many runs. After that,
however. Cooper J steadied down and
pitched winning ball. Corbett's support
was not up to the standard of the team's
usual work. Wheeler had a sore hand
and Dillon took his place at second, Spies
covering first. Cravath got his third
home run of the week. Oakland played a
better game In the field than the locals
and ran bases with Judgment. Score:

There will be a handicap doubles tour
nament on the California Club courts to

play will begin at 10 o'clock. It Is the
second of a series of handicap events for
the new challenge cups. All of the best
players of the club have entered.

Dr. Lovegrove, who has not missed a
day before the nets in many montns,
showed the effects of practice. He beat
Daniel Volkmann, one of the strongest
fourth class players, in straight sets. The
doctor Is a persistent worker and will
surely develop Into a first class player.
His best stroke is nis peculiar service,
which has a reverse twist and bounds
high.
Sidney Salisbury was much too strong
for Hary E. Punnett, who lost three sets
to him.
The following matches were played:
The best match was a singles between
Will Allen and Dr. Hill. As Allen now
plays in the first class he was expected
to beat his second class opponent with
out any trouble. Hill showed, he Is equal
ly as clever with the racket, and Allen
had all he could do to pull out even.
The latter shows up much better against
men who outclass him. He Is undoubt
edly too strong for the second class, yet
seems to have extremely hard work beat
ing second class men. Each of the play
ers won a long deuce Bet. Hill won the
first, 8-6, and Allen the second, 10-8.
The tennis enthusiasts with the aid of
mops and brooms rendered the courts of
the California Club sufficiently dry late
yesterday afternoon to get In some prac

SUMMARY.
In the field San Francisco was as good
as at the bat, and every^man on the team
fielded perfectly every ball tha.t happened
to stray his way. The Brownies commit
ted three errors, the last one, by Butler,
allowing a pair of runs to accumulate.
Delmas poked one of Butler's fast ones
out to right field in the second spasm.
Zearfoss bunted down the first base Una
and Freeman whipped the ball to second,
heading off Delmas by a fast throw. This
made the second out, and it looked bad
for a run, when suddenly Danny . Shay
responded with a wallop to the score
beard for two bases, sending Zearfoss on
a gallop to the pan.
Then all was a great calm till the ninth
vras reached. Zearfoss laced a fast one
out to the right garden and Cutter came
through with a bunt. Â£ Shay produced a
dinky sort of a twister/ and Butler ran to
smother it. Instead he booted the - ball
about for a minute or so, and then threw
it away over Freeman's head. . â¢
"While this little side play was being ex
ecuted Zearfoss sneaked In with a run
and Shay managed to squeeze around as
far as the second bag. Then he made a
dash for third and got away with the
play. Just then Mr. Butler forgot the ex
act location of the plate and hurled the
ball over Shea's head for a passed ball,
that let the native shortstop register the
last run. The score:

It is Just eighteen innings slnco the
baseball pride of Portland has scored a
run against thÂ© tossers under the control
o' Uncle Hank. They never had a look in
yesterday afternoon at Recreation Park.
Many chances came their way. but for all
that the stars were never there when a
run was in sight, and so it ended San
Francisco 3, Portland 0.
Cutter had a slow ball that was the
real tantalizer. He kept putting it over
the plate during the gTeater part of the
combat, and the Brownies kept swinging
at it so hard that they exhausted all
their strength. The best they could do
with the floaters was to hit pop flies up
in the horizon.

THE SAN FR A'NCISCQ "CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1 903.
A large crowd will cross the bay to-day
and watch Britt go through his gym
nasium work. They will not see Britt
box, as Jimmy has profited by the lesson
taught him last month and will not take
any chances of injuring himself.
Britt's father and his friends will bet
heavily on Jimmy's chances of victory.
The betting has gone up to 10 to 7 and Is
likely to be 10 to 8 when the men enter
the ring. Seiger has several backers and
they will wager their money that the
"Iron man" will win. Seiger 13 already
planning other matches. He feels su
premely confident he will defeat Britt.
Seiger thinks he can beat Joe Grim,
the Philadelphia Italian, who refuses to
stay down when punched by men twice
his weight and strength. Seiger Informed
his manager, Billy Roach, that he could
beat Grim and wanted a chance at him.
The advance sale has been large. There
is every Indication of a big attendance
next Tuesday night. The San Francisco
Athletic Club management believes the
lightweights will box before a $10,000
house. The two preliminary battles are
attracting wide attention and a great deal
of money will be wagered on Dave Barry
to beat Maxey Kane and "Spider" Welch
to beat Frank Rafael.
There seems to be some fear In the
Britt carnn that Seiger will not make
the required weight for the coming bat
tle. . Billy Roach, who Is training the
"Iron man." announced yesterday that
his man weighed 136 pounds, and if neces
sary ho could bring Seiger down to 133
pounds, the stipulated weight, within a
day of the contest. Roach says the dry
ing-out system is the last process he uses
In training a man. This is done by omit
ting liquids In any form. It is severe on
the man In training, but it works won
ders in reducing. weight. Alec Greggains
used this plan in training Young Corbett
for his battle with McGovern and the
champion made the desired weight with
out* trouble. Selgers* condition could not
be better. For the past month the Ital
ian has been training at Sheehan's Tav
ern on the Ocean Beach and his muscles
tare like steel. He can run mile3 and
miles and then go Into the gymnasium
and polish off two good men without
pausing for a long breath. Seiger is also
fast on his feet and he promises to give
Britt a lively time.

to-night In the fourth round of what was
scheduled to be a six-round bout at the
National Athletic Club. Many of the
spectators were of the opinion that Maher

The bout was tierce and bloody and
Maher was leading: until the fourth round,
Both men scored knockdowns in the first
round, but they were up and fighting be
fore the referea had counted three. Short
ly before the end of the round, when
Maher sent Monroe down with a right,
Monroe jumped to his feet and clinched.
Maher tried to shake him off, but the
miner held on till the bell rang. . Both
men lost their heads and kept on fighting
after the bell. Both were aggressive, and
when the fight ended they were covered
with blood.

BERKELEY ELEVEN WINS.
Defeats Polytechnic High School in
Final Championship Game.
Berkeley High School won the Academic.
Athletic League football championship
yesterday by defeating Polytechnic High
School by a score of 5 to 0. The game
was played on the Presidio athletic
grounds. A large representation from the
two schools was present.
The only points scored were made io
the first half. During this half Polytech
nic plainly played the better ball, al
though they were scored against. Their
line bucking was good and their end runs
netted them repeated gains. Berkeley
seemed unable to withstand the on
slaughts made by the city players.
Once Polytechnic almost scored a field
goal. Bonitleld, the big right guard of the
team, came within an ace of kicking a
goal from the forty-flve-yard line. Had
there been no wind he would have been
successful. This was in the latter part
of the first half, and after that the Poly
technic players seemed to lose sfrength
and gave way before the heavier Berke
ley men.
A few minutes before the end of the
first half Polytechnic was forced to kick.
Peck, the Berkeley center, blocked the
ball, and Shuey, right tackle for the same
team, grabbed the ball and sped down the
Held forty yards for a touchdown. Dug-
Ran missed the goal. Score, 5 points for
Berkeley.
Edwards, fullback for Polytechnic, made
gouu pains by bucking the line, and Cap
tain Marten and Ayers made lengthy
gains around the ends, the Berkeley ends
seeming unable to break up their inter
ference.
Duggan, Berkeley's right half, was the
star player for his team during that half.
In the second half the Polytechnic team
seemed to be demoralized. They did not
play together, and Berkeley was able to
go through the line at will. Patton, the
fullback, made some great gains, using
the famous Kaarsburjc hurdle. The light
er team was rushed down the field and
Berkeley tried for a field goal from the
twenty-flvc-yard line. "Duggan missed it

The game was a great disappointment
fcr the blue and gold, but every rooter
and every member of the team is confi
dent Stanford will go down to defeat next
Saturday. Many seemed to think it would
result in good for California to be beaten
by Nevada, as It will stimulate the week's
practice. Coaches Whipple and Hall
stated they thought the home eleven
played as good a game yesterday as any
this season. Others were asking why
Stanford might not turn a trick as well
as the comparatively weak Nevada
eleven. Overall said:
This game is no indication of our strength.
We have the better team and could have beat
these men nine times out of ten. \V'Â« shall
only practice the harder for this. 'Wait until
next Saturday and see what we will do to
Stnnfcrd.
Dr. Steckle. Nevada's coach and a fam
ous Michigan end. In comparing the Stan
ford and California teams, said:
I think the elevens are evenly matched.
California has the BtronKer line In Keneral,
although the ends are rather weak. Stanford
has much the better of It In tho baekfleld.
She will gain around the ends while California
will advance the ball best through the line
particularly on the right side. Overall I un
derstand, is a better kicker than Stanford has,
although he did not show up well to-day I
am inclineil to think California expects too
much of this on* man. We have defeated
California and tied Stanford, and I think we
have a team better than either of them I
wish we were to meet Stanford asaln, as we
nre much stronger than when we played her
last.

the Sagebrush* rs got the ball on a kick.
After one play Nevada was v set back 20
yards for holding and- Friesell was stand
ing behind the goal line when he punted.
The ball went outside near the 25-yard
line. The Blue and Gold could easily have
carried the pigskin through for a touch
down had there been time. Overall was
just about to try for a field goal, when
some one on the side lines yelled "time,"
and before the elevens got Into formation
again th<: whistle was Mown.
At the beginning of the second half
California changed ends and halves. Ne
vada kicked 45 yards toSnedijjar. who
came back 2J yards almost without in
terference. He was then sent close
around Nevada's left end for 10 yards
more. The Blue and Gold was penalized
again for holding and kicked from her
own 20-yard line.
The Sagebrushers failed to get on the
same degree of latitude with the stake
and Friesell was about to kick, when the
quarterback fr.mb'.ed. and it was Cali
fornia's ball. Overall immediately punted
45 yards and the ball was down near the
side line.
Here was where Nevada worked the old
University of Michigan trick. The quar
ter delayed the pass and while nine of
the Sagebrushers piled into California's
left tackle the ball was given to I. Steckle,
who ran through right tackle without
molestation. The Nevadan dodged Stearns
and cam*; down the field like a comet,
of which the other twentv-one men In
the game constituted the tall. He gained
at every step and when he dropped on
the ground behind the goal poats of the
Blue and Gold with the p'gskln clasped
affectionately to his breast the nearest
pursuer was 10 yards away.
Two score rooters from the institution
across the border were frenzied with en
thusiasm. The bleachers were uulct as
the grave and the banners all were droop-
Ing. Friesell kicked the soal. although
apparently intoxicated with delight, while
â¢his comrades gyrated back toward the
center of the gridiron.
CALIFORNIA SCORES.
California kicked to Friesell, who got
back 10 yards before he was hurled to
the ground. I. Steckle then went between
the Blue and Gold left tackfe and end for
7 yards. The next plunge resulted in a
loss and Friesell kicked. California buck
ed several times and kicked back.
Nevada was immediately set back to
within a few, feet of her goal line for
holding. Friesell tried to kick out of dan
ger, but the pigskin went low and hit the
line. It bounded back of the goal and
looked like anybody's ball, but when the
players were untangled Lawrence of Ne
vada had the down. It was a safety for
the Blue and Gold.
Nevada punted ten yards past center
from the twenty-five yard line. Califor
nia gained at will through', the line' for
thirty yards. Snedlgar then made twenty
yards between Nevada's right tackle and
end. Some one of the blue and gold had
been holding, however,, and Snedlgar's
gain, together with twenty yards more,
were lost.
Overall kicked and Friesell was downed
within six feet of the goal he was de
fending. The last named kicked out of
danger and Overall tried another field
goal without success. Nevada kicked
back from her twenty-five yard line. Helt
muller caught the ball and ran It thirty
yards through a sea of outstretched arms.
California gained five yards more. Over
all tried for another field goal, but missed
It by a hair.
After an exchange of punts Friesell
caught the pigskin on the fly and went
outside after gaining seven yards. Ne
vada was forced to kick after, failing to
make her distance. California' rushed
the ball back a few yards and Overall
tried for a goal from the forty-yard line.
The ball went over, and the sagebrushera
kicked it back from the twenty-five yard
line again.
The blue and gold advanced the ball
many yards and then Oyerall took an
other chance for a field goal.* .The kick

AN EXCITING MOMENT IN THE NEVADA-CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL
GAME AT BERKELEY AND THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE MOST
SENSATIONAL PLAY OF THE DAY.
k .
THE rooters with the banners cf
blue and gold could hardly reallzs
what had happened as the rooters
with the ribbons of blue and white
cavorted down the field singing "There'll
be a hot time in Reno to-night" after the
football game yesterday afternoon be
tween the teams of the State universities
of California and Nevada on the gridiron
at Berkeley. It was a surprise all around.
Even the Sagebrushers themselves had
not dared- expsct a victory. When the
whistle announced the end of the last
half Nevada had six points and Califor
nia only two.
It was the first time this season that
an opponent had placed the ball behind
the coal posts of the Blue and Gold. An
old siue-line fake and a brilliant 65-yard
run by I. Sttck!e did the trick. The game
was replete with sensational plays, and
the rtsult was in doubt until the time
keeper signaled the end of the game. The
supporters of the rival elevens were
given the chance to yell themselves
hoarse and they made the mOBt of it.
The California team and the rooters
were srr<atly chagrined in view of the
proximity of the great championship con
test and the fact that Stanford had tied
Â»rith the Nevadans. Nevertheless there
is no loss of confidence on the part of
the Berkeley students as to the outcome
of the fcig game.
As a matter of fact, the California team
played all around its opponents for thirty
eight of the fort;' minutes of play. The
backs ploughed through the line for
steady gains when the ball was In the
possession of the Blue and Gold. The vis
itors gained their distance but onco ' ex
ttpting the time when Steckle made h's
long eprint across the streak? of white
wash. California's line was infinitely
stronger than that of the opposing team.
The boys from the Sagebrush State would
get the ball only to lose it on downs or
by punting.
LOSE ON PENALTIES.
California lost scores and scores of
van's on penalties. Whenever U seemed
as if touch-down wan sure, some over
zcalous mcmli':r of the home team, for
getting he was not playing tag, would
ho!d in the line and Oid opportunity
Â¦would be lost. The ball was slippery
nr.d Overall, cs a result, failed to kick
with any particular accuracy, although
he trird for several field goals. Neither
did he nimt in form. Hail the linemen
observed the rules of the game California
would have had at least four touch
downs. The Ncvadans played a hard and
steady game, without either the weight
cr the ability of their opponents.
Stow kicked to I. Steckle on the start
and the Sagrcbrusher carried the pigskin
twenty yards toward the center before
he was downed. California held for
downs and then rushed the ball down the
field to within two yards of the enemy's
Koal line. The visitors took a brace and
held for downs, but were soon forced to
kick after securing the ball. The Blue
and Gold easily advanced the pigskin
back to the 25-yard line, where Overall
missed a place kick for goal.
Frlesell punted back after Nevada had
made two Ineffectual attempts to find a
hole in the line. Mini, Forse and "VVhlp
ple wont through tackle, guard and cen
ter for from four to seven yard gains.
When California had the pigskin on Ne
vada's 20-yard line some one held as the
ball was snapped and the visitors were
forty yards from the danger point. Over
all gained ten' yards on a fake kick and a
punt was then forced. The ball went
over and Fripsell sent it back to the cen
ter from the 25-yard line.
California made rapid gains again, but
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 7.â Harvard
defeated the University of Penn
sylvania to-day in their annual
football game, 17 to 10. Pennsyl
vania scored one touchdown in the first
and one in the . second, while Harvard
scored twico in the opening half and once
In the final half.
Pennsylvania was outplayed at all
| stages. The score does not show the
marker! superiority of the Harvard eleven.
Only twice during the entire game were
j the Quakers able to hold the crim3on
eleven for downs. Pennsylvania's defense
was weak, while the offense was smashed
to pieces by the heavy crimson forwards
the plays would fairly get under
j way. Eliminating the fumbles of llar
; shal! the red and blue would never have
be^n within strikinc distance of the
Harvard goal, while the latter's total
would have been at least thirty.
It was a beautiful day for football and
every seat in the grand stands was
taken. There was a strong wind from the
northwest when play began. Harvard won
the tors and chose the west goal, with
the v.ind at her back. Pennsylvania
kicked off and on the first line up Le
moyne sent the ball far over the heads
of Smith ancV Crlson, who were playing
back for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
could gain nothing and Reynolds kicked
to Pennsylvania's forty-five-yard line.
From this point the Cambridge boys car
ried the ball over for a touchdown with
out once losing It. Harvard then secured
the ball on her thirty-yard line and from
thi.N point the Quakers were pushed down
the line to their forty-flve-yard Hn-e,
where Penn-ylvania lost ground on a
fumble. C. Marshall tried a goal from
the field. It was an easy chance, but a
dismal failure. Reynolds' high kick was
carried back by the wind and it was
Harvard's ball on Pennsylvania's .sixty
five-yard mark. From this point the
Quakers were swept back to their goal,
Nichols scoring a touchdown.
Jn the second half an exchange of punts
gave the crimson the ball on Pennsyl
vania's forty-flve-yard line and Harvard
again got her line-bucking men in opera
tion, Goodhue being shoved over for their
last touchdown. C. Marshall missed an
easy goal and Reynolds and Bennett
each missed easy goals. The line-up:

STANTTÂ»:D UNIVERSITY. Nov. "i.
âStanford duplicated California's
score of 11 to 0 against the Mult-
nomah football eleven this after
noon iu one of the hardest fought grid
iron battles ever seen on the Stanford
campus. The cardinal completed Its
eleven points in. the first half and. al
though ft came dangerously near scor
ing at other times, was never again able
to cross the clubmen's goal line.
Twice Stanford attempted to score a
field goal, but neither attempt was suc
cessful the eleven points being earned
by straight, hard, line smashing football.
The first try for a goal from the field
was made by Halfback Dole with a drop
kick from the 35-yaid line. The ball went
wide of the mark. In the middle of the
second half Loft Tackle Sprott tried a
free kick for goal after a fair catch by
fc'tott on the 40-yard line. The big tackle's
aim was true, but the ball lacked force
behind it and dropped under the bar
squarely between the goal posts.
Multnomah made its chetance against
the cardinal eleven five times, a greater
number than it could make against Cali
fornia. but the good showing of the club
men was made after an aimost new eleven
had been substituted for the original var-
Eity line-up.
The one point that was disappointing to
the Stanford rooters in the game was the
frequency cf fumbles. They wtre not all
costly, but it Is safe to say that if the
varsity team cculd have held the ball the
score would have been five points larger.
Numerous penalties also cost Stanford a

CARDINAL MEN PLAY WELL.
. From the standpoint of the coaches and
the cardinal rooters, tne most satisfac
tory feature of the pame was the work
of the light varsity line men against the
heavy-weights from the Webfoo* State.
The Multnomah line is fully as heavy an
aggregation as the cardinal line will meet
in the California line men next Saturday.
The shewing made by the varsity to-day
ep^aks well for their chances against
California.
JB:& "Jim" \Vcl!er was easily "leading
man" in this afternoon's contest. Time
after timÂ»- h. was hurled at the line for
Â£â¢â¢'Â¦â¢Â¦- ranging from two to fifteen yards.
Aft* r thÂ» came the Mu:tr.<jmah players

flow I Cure Weak, Puny Men |
Give me a man broken down from excesses, dissipation, boyish folly, fj
haru work or worry, from any cause which has sapped his vitality. Let o
him follow my advice for three month3 and I will make him as vigorous In z;
every respect as any man of his age. ~r
I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never Intended 2
by nature* to be strong and sturdy. Even that man I can make better than ~J
he is; but the man who has been strong and h^s lost his. strenuth I can
make cs good as he ever was. â¢ Â©
I can give back to any man what he has !^st by abuse of the laws of Â®
nature. I can stop all drains upon the vital power in trn days. "
A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sloeps badly. Â©
awakes more tired than when he went to bed. r.ho is easily discouraged. In- Â©
clineel to brood over Imaginary troubles, who ha3 lost ambition and energy ta Q
tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which the Dr. McLaughlin Q
Electric Belt supplies. q
The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal Â©
electricity. When you lose tf at by draining the system in any manner my
Belt will replace it and will cure you. q
Mr. Harry U. Jackson. Valleton. Cal.. writes October 1: "Although you are a Q
stranger to me. my heart warms toward you as a crt-at benefactor and friend, and I am Â«t
more than grateful to you. Already I can fe.-J the Ttfor cf rew life In my body; ro **
aches and no pains. I wish you every suocers in your work." Â©
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. Â©
They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from use- C9
!ess doctoring. I get such letters every day. Â©
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces O
and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy in a man. Q
I make the best electrical body appliance in the world, having devot^J Q
twenty years to perfecting it. I know roy trade. My cures after everything q
has failed are my best arguments. q
Mr. Roy Burks. McKittrieks. Cal.. writes: "From the first niRht I wore the belt I 0
felt new life in every part of my body. The drain stopped immediately, and I am now *&
able to do heavy work without tiring. I am glad I thought of the belt, for in no other ~f
way could the money bring me bo much pleasure." w
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his musclea or Â®
joints, "come-and-go" palhs in his shoulders, chest and side. Sciatica in his Â©
hip. Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any ache or pain, and my Belt will pour the O
oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain. No pain &
can exist- where my belt Is worn. Q
Mr. J. L.. Baird of Orland. Cal.. writes October 13: "My back Is entirely well. Q
and 1 would not take $100 for my belt if 1 could not get another. It Is the best thing *j
on earth for a lame back." q
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet q
In the country which has not curefc by Dr. MrLnughlin's Electric Belt. 5f
Now. what does thi3 mean to you, dear readoi ? If you are not what you 2:
ought to be, can vou ask any better Droof to make you try it? Ts there a *J
remedy which Is as simple, as easy to use. as sure to "cure, and as cheap as â¢Â»
Dr. McLaughlln*3 Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must try It. In . Â©
justice to yourself, and to ttiose who look to you for their future happiness, Â©

It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep. It causes no Â©

guilty of gross carelessness and dismissed

Railway to-day. as thÂ© result of an of
ficial inquiry Into the cause of the col
lision last Thursday night between a
loaded meat" car .and engine and the Ala

streets. The entire crew of thÂ© switch
engine was held to be to blame, to som<
extent, for the accident, and Fireman F.
Williams, Yard Switchman George . M.
Stack and Joseph Lazelle only escaped
summary dismissal by the fact that they
held subordinate positions.
It Is deemed a marvel that some lives
were not lost in the accident. A switch
engine attached to a meat car ran Into
the rear end of the Alameda local, smash
ing several car3 and causing a wreck.
Lazelle was severely injured and was un
able to appear at the Investigation to
day. It was shown that the trainmen
ran over the signals of the/ block system
and disregarded the- danger sighals'and
that negligence is the only possible solu

sion Superintendent Palmer, â¢ who found
that there had been an entire disobedience

That They Caused,
a Wreck.
The watchman thinks he knows the
Ft'idcut at whoin^he fired the shot. If his
identification turns oat to be correct, the
Etudent will be hauled up before the
faculty committee on student affairs and
probably expelled. A freshman who cut

sium last night came near ending In a
tragedy, and soma freshman may thank
his lucky etars that he is not now re
clining: on a tltOb at the morgue, because
J. J. Kenny, a university watchman,
fired a shot that was meant at least to
wing. If not to kill, the man who inter
fered with the electric light wires.
The shooting occurred about 1- o'clock.
juEt before the last dance was about to
be reeled off. Kenny, tvho was on the
outside of the gymnasium, guarding the
wires from an attack from the tresbmen,
taw the lights go out and began looking
for the miscreants who hafl cut the wires.
Near the Agricultural College he saw a
student dropping from a tree and called
upon him to surrender, threatening at
the same time to shoot. The student
refused to halt, however, and, taking to
his heels, ran In the direction of the li
brary building. The watchman shouted to
the fugitive once more to surrender, but
receiving no response, drew his pistol
and fired the Ehct. Even the bullet did
rot stop the runner, and In another
minute he was out of eight. It was dis
covered afterward that the light T.ires
were cut near the piece where the
student was f.rst teen.
In the meantime the shooting had
Ladly frightened the dancers In the ball

That ss the reason that the first installment of the "Master of Ao~
pleby^ will have such a bie sale when published in the next Sunday Call.
And perhaps another equally good reason may be found in the fact that
yoc cannot buv this masterpiece of American fiction anywhere cl<e in
any form for lc^s than $i 50. That is one of the big advantages of the
Sunday Coil's literary policv: vou not only get the best books of- the
hour, but you get them for one-tenth of what they would cost vou else
where. That is one of the truisms that has made the Sunday Call so
immensely T>opular. There are no interminable "Continued in Our
Next" scries, no Ions waits between installments. You # not onlv cct
Llic whole novel complete, but vou get it quick. And b'est of all 'The
Master of Appleby" is .vorth having in any shape.
Bv.t. however, that isn't all that there is to the next Sunday Call.
Oh. ccar. no. There is much more besides of the best literature ever
written. For instance, there is "The Roadmaster's Story." the last and
ihc best of Frank H. Spearman's thrilling railroad stories: "On Sentence
Day." by Josiah. Flvnt: "Private ITogan, Coward," and a whole page of
"Half-hour Storiettes" of the sort you want to stay awake at nicht to
nnd: "The Man Who Ended the Land Wars in Ireland" and some
thing amazingly new about "Crime and Criminals" in the West": "The
Smiling Girl," which is a full-page picture that you simply; can't* miss;
'"Xcw Boots for the Athletic Woman." which is another page of pictures
that will keep von on the qui vive: "The Girl Who Served Time." bv
Billy Burgundy: "Me-ows of a Kitty" (you'll laugh at those cats), and
ever so many more thines besides. Indeed, the next Sunday Call will
show you how new the Sunday Call always is.
t f *^"t T this sharp crisis, when a look or a word would cost me more
f j than death and tnv dear lady her honor, it .vas the colonel
\, I v.ha. all unwittingly, stood my friend. A breath of doubt
â¢^ upon my lie and we were lost, and once I thought he would
have breathed it. But he did not. Instead he broke out in a laugh*
with a jribc llune first at Gilbert Stair and then at Faiconnet.
'" 'God save ns. I cive you ioy, Mr. Stair, and you. Sir Francis.
These two have <]upcd you bravely. By heavens. Sir Frank, 'twas vou
who should have had the sword thrust in the duel. In that event you
tnigh! have stood in Captain Ireton's shoes, and so had the priest
fetched for your benefit.' Then he turned to Margrcry with a bow that
had 3 touch of mockerv in it. 'I crare your pardon, madam; I knew not
you were pleading for your husband's life an hour ago. It grieves me
that I may not spare him longer to you than the night, but .var is cruel
at the bcÂ«t.'
"She stood like anv statue done in cold Carrara while he spoke: and
when she made no sich he gave the word to recommit me. '
If yet! were writing a novel do you think you could crowd more of
the anguish, the doubts and fears, the cruelty of war, the hope and cross
purpose of a misplaced love into two hundred words than are woven into
those three paragraphs? Thcv are the very essence of the art of writing.
It nnMers not what went before. It matters much wli3t comes after.
In ths: brief outline vou sret one of the most thrilling situations in
Francis Lynnc's "Master of Appl^by." nnd in those few words vou are
Â«i\ en a wonderful insight in all that has gone before; but better than all
el.^t there is such a promise of exciting things to come that, clever as
ytm may be at weaving a solution for yourself, your curiosity is piqued,
and. true to the ruling passion in human nature, you simply must know
huw some one else could untangle such a strange love affair.

Colonel Wilhelm is to continue his visits
to the several units of the guard in the
State under Instructions from the War
Department and give each advice as to
what should be done before making the
inspections. ,He hopes by giving such ad
vice that he will enable the several or
ganizations to correct many of the faults
that have been noted by Inspectors and
to arouse a spirit of pride that will in
duce all officers and men to devote more
attention to the school of the soldier
which is the preliminary to making first'
class soldiers out of the men who have
enlisted in the service of the State. The
material in the ranks of the several or
ganizations is good, but it needs to bÂ©
trained. The colonel admits that it Is not
easy work to train men to be soldiers,
but he desires to impress on all command
ers that the putting of a uniform on a
recruit, giving him a rifle and putting him
through "fours right" and "fours left"
is not all that is requisite to make a sol
dier of the recruit. .
Colonel Wilhelm will talk to the First
Battalion of Artillery to-morrow night in
the Ellis-street armory.
lie thinks that in yiew of the neglect
with papers at headquarters and delays
ia attending to correspondence there
Bhould be selected for the division and
each brigade headquarters a quartermas
ter, commissary and ordnance sergeant
specially qualified by reason of fitness, to
attend to their respective duties.
WILHELM TO TALK.
The inspector Is of the opinion that
"there is a lack of systematic' theoretical
instruction for officers %nd non-commis
sioned officers throughout the entire divi
sion." He suggests that a general 1 plan
be adopted whereby there should be such
instruction.
"Careful investigation among the field
and line officers of the various regiments
develops the fact that at no time since
the last annual inspection and muster
have the organizations composing the dif
ferent brigades by their respective brigade
commander or his representative been
visited. This condition would Indicate an
utter absence of any interest in the. subor
dinate organizations on the part of the
brigade commander, and it seems that If
these visits are not made voluntarily they
should be required."
The colonel is not sparing of the rank,
for he says: "The records of the various
brigade headquarters are fairly kept, but
I find that no care is taken in scrutiniz
ing reports and returns of different kinds,
as well as letters which are transmitted
through these headquarters. Requisitions,
demands, etc., are approved without re
gard to correctness. Letters are received
and transmitted which are absolutely un
rallltary in form. All of these matters be
ing of great importance, they should re
ceive more careful consideration at these
headquarters.
RECORDS FAIRLY KEPT.

manding Company D, First Infantry, who
a short time since returned from Fort

There were covers for sixty and all seats

Company D prior to and during the Span
ish-American war, and by many others.
The special guest of the evening gave an
Interesting account of his observations at
Fort Riley, and what he said was fre-*

The staff, field and line officers of the
First Infantry will in the near future ten

Major McCreÂ»gh and Captain Mathewson,
at which the first named will report upon

Koster of the National Guard of the State
there were in the whole division, absent
at inspection, thjrty-six officers out of 295
and 572 enlisted men out of 3176. Of this
number 129 officers and men were absent
in the First Brigade, 210 In the Second and
276 in the Third.
Colonel Koster In his report says that
the department of rifle practice In the Na
tional Guard of this State does not re
ceive the attention that this important
part of the service is entitled to. "The
inspectors," he says, "should be fully
posted on the nature and extent of in
struction in th's branch being given In
their respective commands and should be
prepared to make suggestions for the
benefit of this department," but they are
not evidently.
On the subject of armories in the State
he says: "As long as the State does not
provide armories company commanders
will be required to make their own ar
rangements and secure the best obtainable.
The majority of armories are located on
second and third floors of buildings, many
of them frail structures, by no means
fireproof, and in the event of trouble
would be difficult to guard against inva
sion." The best in the State, he says,
are the First Infantry Armory in San
Francisco; Company F, Second Infantry,
in Woodland, and Company G, Sixth In
fantry, in Bakersfteld, while the one oc
cupied by the troops located in Sacra
mento "is miserable, a disgrace to the
State, but it is the best obtainable."
Tlie attention of all members of the
command is called to paragraph 5 of
the army regulations, 1901, and to para
graph 11 of the rules and regulations
of the National Guard of California, and
a strict observance will be required. lioth
relate to the same subject. The language
of the rules and regulations Is as follows:
"Discussions conveying censure toward
others In the service and all* publications
fif a personal nature, whether by news
paper, pamphlet or handbill, between mil
itary men are prohibited."

The recent criticisms upon the National
Guard of California, drawing attention to
laches, neglect and many matters that
did not place the organization In a pleas
ant light, has caustd an awakening, as
appears from the order issued a few days
since from division headquarters, which
says:
Commanding officers of brigades, regiments
and battalions â¢will report to thes" headejuar
jeis not later than December 1, 11)03:
]. What imrtiuns of their commands they
have vl.-itod, specifying the names of organiza
tions and the number and dates qf visits made,
and Whether they were made lur Instruction or
Inflection.
-. U for Instruction, v.hat were .the subjects
covered; if fnr Inspection, what was the extent
of the same?
With its facilities for transporting its
lumber and its ownership of its own lum
ber tracts in Washington, the company's
entrance into the lumber business will
mean such competition with existing cor
porations that unless there is a combina
tion, which is probable, prices will
have to be reduced. At San Pedro the
company has secured a tract of thirty
acres fronting on the deep water harbor,
from which it can unload its vessels and
place their cargoes directly upon the cars
for transportation to points in the inte
rior.
To-day J. C Ford, vice president and
general manager of the Pacific ('oast
Company, announced that his company
will within sixty days establish lumber
yards in I-'>s Angeles, Santa Barbara,- San
Diego, Pasadena, Riversldp; San Bernar
dino, Pomona and subsequently at various
other points. San Pedro will be the point
from which the stock of these various
yards will be distributed.
In order to handle this new business the
company has added to its already large
fleet of vessels three large steam schoon
ers, wh!ch are now in Pr.get Sound ready
to be loaded with the first shipment of
lumber for the Southern California mar
ket. It i4-the Intention of the company to
purchase three other vessels for the same
trade.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS AKGEI.ES, Nov. 7.â The Pacific
Coast Company, which owns the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company, two railroads,
several coal mines, much valuable water
frontage and extensive tracts of timber
lands in the State of Washington, is pre
paring to enter the lumber business
throughout Southern California on a scale
which will revolutionize that important
business In this section of the State.
For more than two years the price of
building materials here has soared to a
degree which would hardly be thought
possible, but despite the high prices there
has been an almost unprecedented build
ing boom in all the more Important towns.
Fortunes have been made In lumber and
prices have constantly advanced.

Judge Henry A. Melvin told Andrew P.
Johnson In court to-day that he ought
to have his "head punched" for sending
a vicious letter to his mother-in-law. The
Judge had just perused the missive and
spoke under the feeling that the offender
was out cf reach of the law and that
such a course was the only one calcu
lated to impress the man with a proper
sense of his vulgarity. The case was
first one for the insanity board, which
was called upon to pass upon Johnson's
sanity. It decided that he was not in
sane, but that he should answer before
the police magistrate for his abuse of his
mother-in-law.
Johnson was taken before the insanity
board on the complaint of his divorced
wife. She said that he was an. English
man and did not believe divorce laws
divorced. When he finally drove her to
take refuge in divorce proceedings he re
fused to acknowledge that a court could
separate what God had Joined together.
He Is a man of some education, and stated
that he was a civil, engineer, at present
out of employment.
After getting her decree of divorce mat
ters for Mrs. Johnson only became more
complicated. She went to live with her
mcther, Mrs. Isabella White, at Eighth
and Webster streets, and took -a position
as a long-distance telephone operator.
Whenever Fhe left her house or office
Johnson followed her. tz sne chanced to
speak to a male acquaintance, he warned
the man In the case that she was his
wife and threatened to shoot him if he
spoke to her again.
Mrs. White, Mrs. Johnson's mother, tes
tified that he threatened "to blow the
roof off her house," and produced the
letter which called for the Judge's in
dignation.
When he began to dog the footsteps of
Charles Bird, the husband of a friend
of Mrs. Johnson, Bird had Johnson ar
rested. Prosecuting Attorney Abe Leach
believed he was insane, and Johnson was
booked for examination. After he had
been declared sane he was rearrested
and taken to the City Prison.

BRISTOL. Tenn., Xov. 7.-The Went*
family denies emphatically the report
that Edward L. Tfentz. the misstep
young millionaire, has been found and
that he Is being held for ransom. They
say they have absolutely no tidings from
the musing man and that the mystery
is to-day as deep as at any time.
The fact that the proposition to deliver
young AVentz for 5100,000 came from what
Is now regarded as a wholly unrellabla
source leaves the family again at sea.
The theory now is that Wcntz was
murdered and the body, it la feared, may
have been consumed In a coke oven or
furnace of some moonshine distillery.

PREPARING TO ACCEPT.
ALAMEDA, N'ov. 7.â Roosters will have
nothing to crow about in Alameda if the
plan proposed by Dr. Kate Van Orden of
the Board of Health Is carried out. J She
stands for thÂ«j banishment from the Island
of chanticleers because the fowls have
been complained of by residents in the
fashionable Grand street district, who al
lege that the birds with the early crow
arouse them from their peaceful slumbers
when they fain would sleep off that tired
feeling.
Dr. Van Ordcn has prevailed upon the
other members of the Board of Health to
join with her and the City Attorney in
devising an ordinance prohibiting the
keeping of crowing roosters within .certain
prescribed precincts, and if . this cannot
be legally done it is probable that meas
ures will be taken to make Alameda a
forbidden city to all chanticleers.
That roosters are a noisy nuisance Dr.
Van Orden is convinced, and as no con
trivance has been invented wherewith the
crowers could be muzzled she wants them
to get out of town and stay there. It is
expected that the anti-rooster ordinance
will be ready for submission to the Board
of Health at its meeting in December.
City Attorney Simpson Is at present at
work upon the document under" orders
fiom the Board of Health.

The man who "cuts" military at the
University of California will have to take
his medicine, just as much as though he*
cut mathematics or physics or any other
study. The rule has just been exempli
fied in a striking way by the suspension
of eight students, who tried by various
means to wiggle out of military duty, but
were finally caught in the act. True
enough, most of the recreant eight got
back after promising Colonel Henry de H. ,
Â¦\Vaite, commandant of the cadet corps, !
to be good in the future.
Of the suspended the most important is j
E. R. Abadie Jr., the crack short-distance j
sprinter. This is Abadie's last year in i
college, but. he Is -still doing the military |
duty, from which seniors are always i
exempt. He 13 still doing the "grind" bâ¬- 1
cause he was excused Innumerable times j
so that he could practice on the cinder !
path. But 1 he dees not take to it kindly i
and now he has had to make his obels- j
ance to Colonel Waite, who removed ths
shackles after twenty-four hours.
The . recorder's ofllce is reticent about
the names of the other seven suspended ;
and they have managed so far to keep j
their Identity concealed. :

exclusive of college men's fraternities,
only the co-eds' society will not usurp the

that wlH send creeps up tho backs of all

The new society will be formed next
Monday night in Hearst Hall. It' will be
an Inter-fraternity organization that will

proposed to give some entertainment each

President. Ripley and some of the Santa
Fe officials made an Inspection of the
Santa Fe extension that is now being
made from Point Richmond to Oakland.
As roost of the work has been done upon
' this end of the line the overhead cross
ing of the Southern Pacific Company's
tracks at Stege not having been com
pleted, the party came first to Emery
ville and went over the line as far as it
has been completed, just beyond Berke
ley.
Work uDon this extension has been de
layed' and there Is even some doubt
whether Santa Fe cars can be brought
into Oakland by January 1. The E. B.
& A. L. Stone Company, which has the
contrapt for the work, will work night
shifts from now on. An electric lighting
plant is being put in with 150 arc lights,
1 and not an hour of the day or night will
now be lost. The dynamo has been in
stalled at tho general grading camp near
the old Red House on~4*w Contra Costa
County line. The principal delay has
been in the overhead cross of the South
ern Pacific Company's tracks at Stege.
The foundation of - the Berkeley depot
at University avenue is In and the build-
Ing will be completed before the Santa
Fe Is ready to cfperate Into Oakland and
through Berkeley. Nothing has been
done yet toward the construction of the
Oakland depot at Fortieth street and San
Tablo avenue.
At present the system is being operated
solely upon single trip tickets, many
taking the ride for the novelty. The
commutation tickets* will be placed on
sale on December I, when there probably
will be another time schedule put into
effect.
The through train service will only be
from Berkeley at present, and the Oak
land service will be by single car that
will transfer at Fortieth street and San
Pablo avenue to the Berkeley main line
train. The Berkeley train will leave
Kast Berkeley station at 5:36 a. m., again
at 6:40 o'clock and then every half hour
until 5:40 p. m., after which there will be
trips at 6:40 and 7:25 p. m., then every
hour until ,11:25 p. m., at which time the
last boat will leave.
The Oakland car will leave Broadway
and Fourteenth street at 6:40 a. m., 7:10
a. m. and then every half hour until 5:40
p. m. There will then be trips at 6:40 p.
m. and 7:25 p. m., after which" there will
be hourly trips at 25 minutes after the

"AT THE OPERA."
The first subject selected could scarcely be recognized
by the half-tone above, on account of the impossibility of
showinsr the exquisite coloring of the original by this
process.
Copies of the original which are to be given away are
displayed in prominent places throughout the city. Don't !
fail to inspect one.
"At the* Opera" has a decidedly pleasing flavor in its
composition. It depicts a beautiful, buddinar younjj
woman, rich in all the attractiveness of her youne life,
and typically an American Girl. t
The ideal Grecian profile, the rich coloring of her au-
burn hair, the carelessly draped opera gown, exposing:
her delicately chiseled neck and bust, all combine to srive
the study a distinct character. The background could not
be more aptly described than by the saying â it's Bry-
son's â as in his execution and handling of colors he
seems to. impart to his creations a bit of life and dash
seldom attained by contemporary artists.
REMEMBER â The publisher has no possible way of
knowine just how many of this set to order; the best he |
can do h to guess; and as it will take weeks for addi-
tional orders to be refilled, it seems proper to suggest
that every one wanting this beautiful "Series in Gold"
ouc:ht to order from his carrier, newsdealer or 'phone
this office in ample time. The demand will be tremen-
dous.

WHEAT â The markets everywhere remained
about the same. -The American nltuation Is
thus given In Bolton. De Kuyter & Co.'s
Chicago letter:
"The market wan extremely dull, very lit
tle doing In the. caoh market and speculative
operations on a small scale and of a scalping
nature. Broomhall eetlmates the- world's
shipments at about 10.000,000 bushels, with
come decrease on passaK*. Primary receipts
are again a little less than last year. The
visible supply on Monday will likely ehow a
fair increase. The whole situation Is one of
dullness, eo far as 'speculative features or
opportunities are concerned. A rather small
domestic demand makes a good many bulls..
On the whole, however, with 1,500,000 bushels*
of wheat coming out of farmers' hands every
day the domestic situation does not wholly
control. We must export wheat and we are
therefore dependent -upon foreign markets.
With Europe receiving a little less than
the estimated weekly consumption each week
and with the unusually favorable prospects'
Jn Australia and Argentine, It hardly seemii
probftWa that European markets will either
lead or follow an advanco at this time Unless
they do, it will be hard to maintain an ad
vancing market here. The situation may
easily work quite, bullleh later, but for the
imm<-iliat<> future wÂ« don't believe it will hurt
to sell wheat on the hard spots."
In this market futures were lower, owlns
to the early morning, rain and tho weakness
at Chicago, but cash grain showed no change

Despite the inclement weather trading In
the fruit market was active under the usual
Saturday demand among local dealers and a
cteady inquiry for shipment on tha Puget
Sound steamer. Table Grapes In crates were
Hie leading feature of the shipping trade and
choice lots of Tokay and Cornichon found
ready sale at the maximum quotation. The
top 'price obtained for the Verdel and Black
varieties T/as 63c. The loccl demand ran
largely on the large open boxes., which were
In free supply, and the^top quotation was an
extreme figure for the best orferings of the
Muscat variety, $1 00 being about the top for
the other kind?. There was a fair shipping
inquiry for Pomegranates. Persimmons and
Quinces, but as supplies were ample prices
were no higher. Trade In Apples vras fairly
active and some strictly fancy offerings of
the SplUenberg variety were firmly held a f
$1 B0K1 75 oer box. but few sales were re
ported at that figure. Fancy Winter Nellls
Pears were in small supply and steady, while
common offerings were abundant and dull.
Figs arrived freely from Sonoma County, but
were mostly of poor quality and sold slowly
at unsteady prices.
; Receipts of Raspberries and Strawberries
were moderate, and attractive lots cleaned up
readily at full figures. The market was again
bare of Huckleberries. Cranberries were In
gpod request and firm.
Citrus 'Fruits were In ample pupply arid
dull particularly low grades of Lemons. Ripe
Bananas continued scarce and high.

at 23S.S52 bags, against 191, S72 during the
same time in 1902. Tho sales from first hands
were. 220,167 bags, against 1S2.483. The stock
in first hand3 November 1 was 31,722 bags,
against 24,716 last year. The circular says:
"The demand since last Issue has been very
active Â¦ and a large business has been done
both locally and for overland shipment at
somewhat higher figures,' in, sympathy with
the advance in the 'New York and European
.markets. Soot quotations in New York have
advanced %c on No. 7 Rio and %c on No. 4
Santos during the pa?t month and futures
from. 00 to- SO points and remain steady under
unusually : heavy buying â sales on the ex
change averaging more than 100,000 bags per
rlay for the past ten days. While the advance
Is attributed to the heavy buying- of speculative
interests the prevailing opinion is that prices
will tend higher. Tho local statistical position
is good, there remaining 33,172 bags in first
hands, not an- overabundant supply In second
hands and a continued active demand for over
land .shipment. A shortage of the more de
sirable shlpptnz grades exists and business
with overland markets Is naturally curtailed
by the remaining holdings. The market in

The schooner Seven Sisters, which arrived
yesterday from Golovln Bay. nearly turned
turtle off Point Reyes In one of the flfty-mlle
an-hour pqualls that yesterday churned up the
i-f-a at that part of the coast. The squall
ctruck her suddenly and before a halyard
could be let go or a sheet touched over she
went on her beam Â«-nds. For a short space
her fate hung in the balance. All hands
became suddenly busy; everything fast was
let go. and in a few minutes the danger had
pa&sed. The officers of the Seven Sisters re
port that food is very scarce at Teller City.
Captain Campbell was offered $2500 if he
would take in 100 tons of provisions, but the
lateness of the season made this impossible,
and Teller City, according to the officers of
the Seven Sisters, is going to be a very hun
gry place this winter.
Nearly Turns Turtle.
Masked Man Baids Clubrooms.
OGDEN, Utah. Nov. 7.â A single
masked robber entered the Elite Club
rooms last night, lined up three men
against the wall and relieved them, of
about $3000 in cash and certificates of de
posit. The robber entered the room
through a back door, and evidently wore
rubbers, as the men did not hear him ap
proach until he told them to hold up
their hands. After getting all the money
in sight he stepped to the door, told the
three men that the first one that looked
around would be "plugged" and then dis
appeared.

WHALING SCHOONER MONTEREY WHICH ARRIVED YESTERDAY
FROM THE NORTH AFTER AN EVENTFUL CRUISE, DURING
"WHICH SHE GATHERED IN 3590 POUNDS OF BONE.
The carelessness of somebody at San Diego
vrat responsible for the scare the British bark
Vanduara gave those interested In her. She
Â¦was reported as having left the southern port
fifty-neven days ago for Puget Eound. A*
time Â«]Â¦Â¦Â« d and the vr-*el failed to put in an
appearance at the northern port, underwriters
became un?asy and on Friday the Vanduara
waa reinsured at 10 per cent. The rate ad
vanced yesterday to 25 per cent. A number
of speculators who had played her at 10 per
oent "not to arrive" sold out when the rate
r<achÂ»d 2o. per cent, maJclng a quick and Â»ub
rtantial profit. Meanwhile the advisability of
communicating with San Diego was suggested.
This was done and late In the afternoon it
was learned that the Vanduara nailed, not for
PuÂ«et Sound, but for Newcastle, Australia,
and has still plenty of time within which to
make a good passage. ' .
Vanduara Not Overdue.

DENVER, Nov. 7.â Governor Peabody
to-day set aside the verdict of the court
martial which found Brigadier General
John Chase guilty of disobedience of or
ders and sentencing him to dismissal from
the service. The Governor decided that
the findings of the court were correct, but
in view of the general's previous good
record restored him to duty as commander
of the National Guard of Colorado. The
charge of disobedience of orders was filed
against General Chase by Adjutant Gen
eral Sherman Bell, who issued an execu
tive order at Cripple Creek, which was
disregarded by the commander. General
Chase attempted to justify his action on
the . ground that majiy ''manufactured
executive orders" had been Issued and he
was in doubt as to whether the order in
question really came or not.

NEW YORK, Nov. 7.â ThÂ© Financier
says: The striking feature of the state
ment of the New York Associated Banks
last week was the close correspondence
In the loss of cash as officially shown with
estimated losses as based upon the trace
able movements of money during \ the
week. The decrease in this item was
$8,277,900 as disclosed by the statement,
while the estimates indicated a loss of
$10,814,000. Doubtless the decrease last
week was partly due to the bringing over
from the previous week of the three days'
average, which waa 'not reported in the
previous week, and adding thereto the
average Ios3 on the cash movement last
weel:. â¢ x
The deposits were decreased $17,571,900.
which amount Is less by $3,114,000 than the
sum of the loss of cash and of the de
crease in loansâ the latter being. $11,413,000
âtherefore the statement fails to balance.
The required reserve was reduced
through the decrease in deposits by
$4,692,975. Deducting this sum from the
loss of cash as above leaves $4,S97,d23 aa
the decrease In surplus reserve, making
this item $5,394,225. Computed upon the
basis of deposits, less those of $37,182,200
of public funds, the surplus is I14.6S9.T75.
The cash holdings of the banks now, it
may be noted, are only $3,902,600 higher
than the minimum of twelve months. On
December 27 last year the specie was $153,
744.300, while on March 21, this year, the
legal tenders were $64,753,500, making the
total, $218,502,800 cash; the total reserve
reported last week was $222,405,400, includ
ing $159,435,900 specie and $62,943,500 legal
tenders. The excess of loans over depos
its, which in the previous week was $25,
981,900, was last week $32,050,800. Indicat
ing that the banks drew largely upon
their loanable resources, including capi
tal. The decrease of $11,414,000 in loans
last week was doubtless due to operations
incident to the November settlement.
Comparisons of loans show that three
of the larger banks reduced this item by
$7,000,000. The loss of cash by this num
ber of institutions was $4,800,000.
Judge Graves set the case for retrial
December 14. The case of Senator C. A.
Smith on the same charge was set for
trial December 16.
JEFFERSON CITY. Mo.. Nov. 7.â The
jury before which State Senator Frank
H. Farrls was tried on a charge of brib
ery in connection with alum legislation,
came into court at 10 o'clock and report
ed that it had failed to agree on a ver
dict. The Judge thereupon discharged the
jury from further service. The foreman
reported that the Jury stood eight for
conviction and four for acquittal. This
necessitates a new trial.
Senator Farris was the first of the in
dicted members of the Legislature to be
tried on charges of boodling. He was
tried on a direct charge of receiving
$7000 and distributing it - among seven
members of the Committee on Criminal
Jurisprudence for holding up the bill in
troduced to amend the law prohibiting
the use of alum in baking powder. This
money, the testimony went to show,
came from Daniel J. Kelly of New York,
a representative of the baking powder
trust, and was alleged to have been hand
ed to the accused by former Liuctenant
Governor John A. Lee. This was the
testimony of Lee, who appeared as a wit
ness for the State. A letter purporting
to have been written by Lee to Kelley,
returning the $7000, was presented as evi
dence, but Lee denied the authorship of it.
Foreman Ross said: "The four' men
who voted for acquittal were Peter Lauf,
Ben Pringer, James Clark and Benjamin
Lockett. Every one of the four agreed
that he thought Farris but he
felt that under the instructions the testi
mony, was not sufficiently, strong to per
mit him to vote that way. They felt
that there was a reasonable doubt of
guilt." .->Â« â¢

We Farr.ish House* Complete. All Cars Lead to Our Store. Country Orders Solicited.LONDON, Nov. 7. â For some unex
plained reason there has been a
great Interest in What London
folk call "hooliganism." The
riotous street demonstrations on
"ilafeklng Night" and in celebration of
the close of the Boer War taught the
etream of toughs who poured out from
Whlteehapel Into the West End that the
renowned London "bobby" would not be
everywhere at once, and that with a ra
tio of twenty hooligans to one bobby
quite a bit of law-breaking might be
done In more safety than had been sup
posed.
Since then a number of solitary way
farers have been attacked and robbed
ar.d two or three have been murdered â
all of which was most disconcerting to
the independent English woman, who has
taken to going on bicycle rides into the
country by herself and to walking about
the city streets in the daytime without
the chaperone who was considered so
r.ecessary a few years ago. Lady Jeune
had her pur&e wrenched from her re
cently by a hooligan in the fashionable
Kensington district of London, and Lady
Mary Sackville was robbed of her bag
nr.d chatelaine not long ago by a rough,
Â¦who assaulted her and decamped. Many
other attacks of the sort have been made
on less famous folk.
PABASOL T?HE WEAPON.
In consequence of this state of affairs
it occurred to a young French woman,
the wife of the famous French swords
mar., Pierre Vigny. to undertake the in
struction of Englishwomen in the art of
Â»df-defense with a parasol or walking
stick, according to a system devised by
I.er gallant husband, who has devoted
years to its perfection. It may best be
described as a mixture of the various
methods of self-defense practiced In
England. France. Germany and Japan.
Many of the passes, thrusts and wards
used* in fencing are comprised in it.
S"rnÂ« of the guards used by boxers and
t!i<* movements of the leg and foot prac-
T ; -fd by exr^r.ents of French boxing are
5ntro<3-.!eÂ«Hi. as well as certain methods
peculiar to Grman swordsmen and pro
fÂ«FsorF of the rapier. Numerous~tricki
by "invincibles" soon after the Phoenix
Park murders in 1SÂ£2, has since learned
fencing.

But fencing must not be confounded
with the method of self-defense with an

LONDON. Nov. 7. â According to a
true story Just told to me by a close
friend of the Duchess of Marlbor-
* â¢ - ough, there" appears to be an enter
taining element , superstition in., her
character. Four years ago she was nego
tiating for the purchase of Kylemore
Castle, which became the property, of the-
Duke of Manchester a few weeks ago;
thanks to Papa Zimmerman's millions.
The Duchess was so J satisfied with Its
beautiful situation . and magnificent ap
pointments that money would not stop her
from possessing: it.
She was on the point of paying a de
posit and the auctioneer's fees when sha
heard that the only daughter of Mitchell
Henry, who built the mansion, was
drowned in the lake within the Immediate
sight of the drawing-room. She j sent a
special messenger to the auctioneer ask
ing him If the story was trde, and on
being informed that It was so, she In
vited him to send In his account for any
out-of-pocket expenses the negotiations
had cost him, at the same time advising
htm that she would not have the mansion
as a gift. i %L â¢ .
The auctioneer was not pleased and he
insisted that the Duchess should carry
out the contract. The' price agreed upon
at the time was $330,000, which was $23,000
more than what the Duke of Manchester
has now paid for it. The auctioneer was
entitled to 1M per cent on the sale, and
he felt that the Duchess should pay him
an amount equivalent to that. The
Duchess retaliated by saying that if he
desired to k give publicity to the ghost
stories she had heard about Kylemore
castle, its lakes and beautiful waterfalls,
she was ready to go Into court, and she
there and then submitted the names of
Duchess Consuelo

Ghosts.
her solicitors who would accept service
on her behalf. The auctioneer, a man
named J. H. North, collapsed.
Loie Fuller, whose engagement at thÂ©
Palace Theater of Varieties. London, is
now on, is stopping at the Savoy Hotel.
London. Miss Fuller's dresses, off ttÂ»Â»
stage, are. as usual, attracting attention
by. virtue of their simplicity and similar
ity. -They are all made in the old-fash
ioned short walsted fashion Miss Fuller
has so long a (Tec ted and are the work o T
the best Viennese tailors. In private
life there is no more quietly dressed
woman than Loie Fuller. She loathes
"make-up" and will not even use powder
anywhere but in the theater.
Miss Fuller, much as she enjoys her
dancing and the success she has had with
It, loves better than it or anything elsÂ»
that interesting home of hers In Paris.
Few people are aware that she is a
scientist of no small scholarship and that
in her Parisian back yard there stands
a well equipped laboratory. There Miss
Fuller performs the experiments from
which she evolves the marvels of her
dance. Those who think "La Loie" any
thing like the ephemeral creature of her
professional life are much mistaken. She
is a singularly serious-minded, rtudioua
woman. Few of her friends are theatri
cal folk. She has a sort cf salon and the
men and women who compose it are the
leading scientific and artistic lights j of
Paris. The stage element is notable for
Its absence.
Miss Fuller has another deep affection
besides that for her home. She is de
voted to her Invalid mother. Only inti
mate friends of the family have any real
understanding of the bond existing be
tween this mother and daughter. The
sacrifices of both time and money the
dancer has made for Mrs. Fuller's sake
are infinite. Once when, after a long and
tedious Journey, she had reached the Rus
sian frontier en route to fulfill an en
gagemeat in St. Petersburg, Miss Fuller
received a telegram saying her mother*
was ill and "want3 to see you." As a
result the contract was broken, thou
sands of pounds forfeited and Miss Ful
ler returned to Paris.

including the present King of Servla,

Peter is a splendid, all-round athlete,
and adds that, should another revolution
deprive him of the blood-stained crown
he wears. Klr.g Peter could readily earn
his living es a boxer or teacher of fenc
ing. "HÂ« is *o clever with a waJking-

sticks, swords or daggers â anything, in
fact, but firearms. If the late King had

A CUBE FOB STAGE FBIGHT.
Queen Elizabeth of Roumania (Carmen
Eylva) is another royalty who has been
taught fencing by Mme. Vigny. Her
Majesty learned this art because she de
clared it gave her so much confidence In
herself, especially when she was about
to lecture. Bhe has no fear whatever of
assault, but Queen Elizabeth declares, that
the eelf-poEsession which the knowledge
cf fencing has given her has proved to bo
an excellent antidote to etage fright and
nervousness from which she used to suf
fer whenever ehe lectured.
An English society lady who is famous
as a fencer is Miss Toupie Lowther, who
could probably hold her own against any
champior. of the small sword or rapier
on the continent of Europe.
Miss Baden-Powell, the sister of the
famous general, impressed by her broth
er's adage that "a emile and a stout
stick will carry one through any dif
ficulty," has become proficient in self-de
fense with a parasol and walking cane.
Lady Florence Dixie, who was attacX*d
does not take long to acquire. After three
months' tuition an average young girl
would be equal to almost any emergency.
No matter how well a rough might box,
he would have no chance to get in a blow
and he would be powerless to , protect
himself from terrible punishment in the
shape of thrusts or prods, and while v stag
gering from the effects of these, he .would
receive blows on the head and face that
would speedily dispose of him. ' Further
more, the pupils are taught how to trip
an adversary up and throw him with tho
handle of the umbrella and how to throw
him should he close, after the manner of
the Japanese. A combined knowledge of
the laws of dynamics and anatomy can
always defeat mere strength and in a
street fight where the Queensberry rules
of the ring are not observed, the skilled
pugilist would be at the mercy of the
child who understands these arts and
possesses the nerve to put them to prac
tical account.
In proof of this. Is a little affair that
M. Vlgny had on hand when he was mas
ter of arms to the Second Regiment of
Artillery, a post he occupied for three
years in the French army. He was at
tacked by eleven roughs armed with
knives and belts In the slums of Mar-
Bellies. He was only provided with a
walking stick and yet emerged from the
fray as triumphant as Cyrano de Berger
ac after his fight on the bridge. The
memory of this exfloit Is preserved in
the regimental records, so there is no
doubt as to Its authenticity.

Sleeves and bodice proper cut In one
piece! This is the latest development of
Franco-British dressmaking. The most
"swagger" tailor in London has produced
within the last week a marvelous gown
for the thin woman. In it there Is abso
lutely no chance of her being thin any
longer. There is no telling where her
arms beginâ where her body stops. And
yet It is the most fascinating of novel cre
ations. The model gown in this unique
stylo is made of broadcloth, one of those
new terra cotta reds which are to be sf
fashionable. Heavy plaits hang from thv
shoulders, elaborately embroidered In fine
Persian braid. The sleeves enter the gar
ment in the side plaits about three inches
above the waist line. The effect is much
more interesting than it sounds. This
fashion it Is prophesied will find special
favor with the English on account Â¦ of
their style of figure. It Is admirably
adapted to long, angular women and to
small ones with fiat chests.

"Maurice Grau brought what may be

perfection In thla city, and when last
season he retired from management, he
left to his successor, Heinrich Conried, a
serious problem. There were no new stars

refulgent in the Grau seasons were rapid
ly sinking behind the western horizon. No
successor to Jean de Reszke appeared in
the East and contraltos of the first mag
nitude seemed to have deserted the vocal
firmament. At first, Mr. Conried seemed
to cherish the idea that stars might be
blotted out entirely; that It would be
sible to go forward with a simple working
stock company and good ensemble pro
ductions of opera. The wealthy gentle
men who were officiating as directors of
his company speedily convinced him that

"But Mr. Conried, unwilling to abandon
his project of stirring the populace with
new productions, determined upon a bold
coup. Ho would lay violent hands upon
'Parsifal,' the chief prop of the falling
fortunes of Bayreuth and the largest vis
ible evidence of means of support of the
Wagner family. Not much sympathy can
be wasted on the insincere and grasping
widow of the famous master, nor her
empty and pretentious son. But almost
nothing can bo said In defense of Mr. Con
ried's action. Wagner designed 'Parsifal'
for Bayreuth. He did not mean that It
should ever become an ordinary opera of
commerce. Its BUbject "matter and meth
od unfit It for huckstering. Furthermore,
oven if there is any question of the legal
rights of the Wagners in this country,
there Is none as to their moral rights In
the work. Whether Mr. Conried succeeds
or not in defeating ' the legal operations
against 'the production, which cannot be
foreseen at the time of this writing, there
can be ho two opinions as to the ethical
nature of his operations."

countenance shine on such proceedings,

system, then,. Is- to bo continued under a

"I meant to give this to my press man.
Never been told before," the minstrel be
gan. "It's Just the bones of the thing,
but it would make out. â¢ â¢ â¢ There is
an actress named Clarice Vance, comes
to the Orpheum soon, I believe. She has
a. small dog she calls Betsyâ black and
tan terrier. Betsy travels with her mis
tress In a small handbag marked *B. V."
One day on the train I met Miss Vance.
I had a handbag also marked 'B. V.' The
story, of course; is In the mixing of the
handbags. Miss Vance would get off at
Buffalo with my bag. I'd go to Chicago
with hers. Hers I would leave for two
days at the hotel. Then I'd go back
and find a telegram saying, 'Horrid
wretch, send me my dog and I'll sena
you your laundry." I'd rush to the bag,
open It and then a black and tan little
demon would look up and say, 'I hate
you!' "
And that's all. We ehook hands affec
tionately after it and I went back to a
foolish, hustling world.

broke out joyfully, "but there are limits."
It took no wiM horses to persuade me
to tho California Theater after that. Mr.
Van waa there almost on time, and for
an hour his au3ienrÂ« of two hod the
famous end man all to itself.
While he was being p<=r?uaded into the
light by the artist I had time to take in
"^â¢c minstrel's "limits." His eyes, small
and brilliantly blue, are the first and last

ably in his chair, "I came by the rail

"What do I Fay here?" I laughed,
hoping that Van would not miss the other
end man too much.
"That's all risht. though. Sure." he
smilrd. "My father was a railroad man.
It was the height of his ambition for me
to be one. I'd have been getting my $*)

m<Â» to watch one night. I awakened when
the last station showed up. 'You'll never
loarn the road,' the old man said. Do I
look like a conductor?" he suddenly
chuckled.
"Net at all," I truthfully replied.
He pulled out a cipar hero, and looked
at it patiently, sikntly, almost longingly.
"Do. please." I requested, nodding to
the cifrar. "I enjoy it."
Sleepily happy, he lighted it and began:
"Parents ought to let children do what
they want. They should find out what
they're made for. We can all <3o best
what we like best to do. And then it's
best for everybody. They say 'look at
George Washington. ' As If the Lord ever
made them in pairs."
"Some of us have no particular best,
though. One trade is as good as another
to such. We follow " I threw in.
"Like eheep," Van asserted. "Three
quarters are like that. I was talking of
the rest."
"We were talking *f you." I prompted.
"Well," he picked up the cue, "I wanted
to be a minstrel (puff. puff. puff). After
my father discovered my talent wasn't
for railroading they tried me on teleg
raphy. <Puff.) I stood it because I couid
po mlnstreling at night. I went by the
name of Wood and I was far enough from
home for my father not to find out about
It. (Puff, puff, puff.) Then I got a fellow,
named Staley. in London, Cincinnati, to
give me an engagement. He put me out
of the building the first night. He did. "
(Puff, puff, puff.)
"But somehow," Van continued, "I
found -vork in a lot of little places. Then
I got in with L.- G. Field's company, the
first of the modern minstrels, and I
haven't had to po back to telegraphy."
I gave up trying to imagine the min-
Ftrcl as a telegrapher and asked: "Is
Van your real name, then?"
"I told that to the other man, too" â
puzzled the minstrel.
"Then you wiil have to tell me," I de
cided for h:m.
"One of the other papers had me re
lated to the Van Renspelaers the other

ewering. "Wouldn't do for them to po

It. Probably somo genius of repose like
Van furnished the inspiration of the
story of the man who was hangod be
cause he was too lazy to lift the rope
from his neck!
Somehow the talk Ehiftol then to the
F'Jbject of critics. "They j>i<-k you over,
dissect you, cut you up with very little
mercy, sometimes," the minstrel was say-
Ke did, but before, somehow, told me
of possessing a famous banjo used by the
famous Christy minstrel, Eph Horn, be
fore the war. "Great big thing it is, like
a tab. Big, thick strings and big, thick
tone. My uncle left it to me,"
And now, here is the recipe for making
a Van story. Here is how to become the
leadinp: endman of ihe class. Here is
what Van takes to double up a house In
two minutes, In its very essence.
"Nervous!" I cried delightedly.
"Didn't you notice how fast I walk on
the street," he returned unanswerably.
"Lovely!" 1 said. "And now won't you
toll me Just how you make up one of
your ownest own stories?"
"Yes, I can tell whether a show-goer
is a sport or not by his necktie," he ex
claimed. "I know by the way he combs
his hair, by what sort of a suit he wears,
by the way he sits. You can't tell any
thing to that kind of a fellow" â the man
of his bit of mimicry. "And when you
pot an audience three-quarters made up
of that kind, you can't do much. I'll tell
you what I do. There are some jokes
that a legitimate audience will accept,
and quick, and only a legitimate audl
Â«?nce. Our two end men that come on
before me have one of them. I figure the
audience ahead on just that one little
point. That's where I have the pull,
coming later. If they don't take that,
then I cut out of mine what I know
won't po."
"Whore do you get most of your ma
terial?"
"On the trains," the minstrel replied.
"I have so much tfme, and I've been over
the ground so often, there's nothing to
do but think things up. I listen to every
thing â notice nothing." dropping Into a
courteous paradox, "I'm nervous on the
trains â not about accidents, no. Just
tired of the tcdiousness."
He relapsed after our tributary laughs
into his former attitude, exuding ease
by. the hatful. If ever a man's "aura"
spelt "peace" It is Billy Van's."
It was a capital bit of farce-comedy.
'"About the same," Van began, then
contradicted himself, "no, he's wiser. His
mother has let him run on the streets,
and he's learned things. There are news
boys of 3 0 that know as much as a man
of 35," ho pursued. "Poor kids, they've
heard men talk and picked up every
thing and anything.- That sticks that
belongs, though."
"Then there are a few men who don't
j=?e jokes?" I ventured.
"Lots," said Billy Van; "this ilhd."
With gestures as quick as his former
movements were slow, he dropped Into
his Idea of the amateur "show-goer." He
drew his stiffened knees together, stuck
bashful fingers between them, thrust out
a wondering chin and opened his blue
eyes into very lakes of wondering stu
pidity.
'How about the boy audience?"
"They don't, bless 'em!" Van said.
"The man that caterpd to them and tho
young girl wouldn't be long in the min
strel business. But motherTs the only
thine. Mine was." ,
"Lord, yes," answered Van. "Some
towns I hate to go to. I sleep all the
afternoon to keep from looking at 'em.
Audiences, too. There are towns you get
into where they don't have much going
en, where there is what we call a 'mullet
headtd' audience â 'tisn't a tasty word,
but it means well. They don't know quite
what you're up to. don't understand tTIe
jokts, the slang. He takes Her and they
look at each other. They like it, but
they're too busy to say soâ or afraid of
making a noise.^ You can't blame 'em.
They don't know that we can't give them
our best without we cet the appreciation
from them. They don't know how much
we depend on the applause. That's the
kind of audience that gives you dyspepsia
all over. It certainly doâ¬s."
"Do you find that women usually ap
preciate minstrel fun as well as men?"
"Ah:" Van laughed. "Some do. Not the
kind we get at the matinees usually,
young girls and the mammas with the
babies. When the mother comes with
the babies she's too bothered with them
to take in the fun. If the kid wanders
ten feet up the aisle, do you think any
Joke on earth will keep her eye on the
stage? All she cares about is that chyd.
Some of them shake their babies right
at one on the stage. They think we ought
to see them. She thinks it's just the
grandest thing on earth, that child.
Well, it is," the minstrel quaintly ended.
It is not for nothing that be has that big
human voice.
"But mamsna and the baby don't make
the best port of audience?"
"There's a wonderful difference in au
diences, isn't there? And towns?" I sug
gested.
"You should have seen last night's
house; coldest I ever struck at the Cali
fornia. 'Twasn't a California house at
all. Not at all. For why?" he said.
"Election night. That's the way I figured
It. They weren't real good Californiansâ
probably strangers here. You bet you I
wouldn't have been in a theater last night
if I'd lived here."
"I had a song this time," he began,
after barring, - a knock on the 'Good Old
Summer Time.' Last summer I gave it
to Low Hawkins in Chicago. I like him,
and if s a good song. But I didn't dream
he'd fcrins it here before me. I found on
Sunday, jupt before the show, that Haw
kins had used it four weeks ago. It was
rr.y star pi.;ce. Oh, Hawkins wouldn't
have used it if he'd known." in reply to
the interrogation point in my eye. Â¦
"You seem to have 'made good* on Sun
day, just the same," I said.
!;ack," I symr-ithized with this victim o'
u.nanlmous eritiea.1 laudation.
"No more ifcan an audience has of get
ting its money back," Mr. Van grinnerl
lightly, 'it':; mostly in the small towns

"Of course," I rejoined.
"Jn the little places they pull things to
pieces just to mako the people believe
they know it nil."
"It is comfortable to know the habit la
cmfined to tho smaller towns."
"It Isn't," the minstrel contradicted.
"Hut v,e kno'v.-. We kijow when we have
a bad show. Sometimes a young fellow
will say when he's roasted, 'I always did
get a Lad notice here.' But we older ones
don't talk. Wo ilnd out what's wrong and
remedy it. If you have a show and the
audience lauehs short, only half of it. or
goes out in bunches, THEY. DON'T
WANT WHAT YOIJ'VK GOT. And
you've got to give 'em something e!so.
There are the fellows that get behind
date," Van philosophized. "They rake
up old stories, twentyâ thirty years old.
They tell 'em because they used to get
laughs twenty years ago. Half of the
audience won't know 'em. They laugh.
I?'Jt ii s tho other half that countsâ and
the critic's in it. Then there's something
to .get from under." and the minstrel
shook slowly the head that holds so much
<Iro'l sense.
"How do you manage to get every
thing new?" I queried.
"I miike meet of mine." tho end man
replied.
"Songs, too?"
â¢"Songs, too."
"Did you ever study singing?"

Paul Steindorff has the following inter
esting things to say of the new opera,
"Zaza," that will be given next week at
the Tivoli for the first time in America,
or Indeed out of Italy. Importantly thÂ«
conductor believes the new Leoncavallo
opera destined to as large popularity as
the same composer's "I'Pagliacci," al
though such has not so far been the case
in Italy, where alone the work has been
heard up to now. For this Mr. Steindorff
imagines there is a good and sufficient
reason in the fact that "Zaza" is in much,
lighter vein than any of the modern
Italian works, hardly, therefore, what its
Italian audiences were probably In mood
for. Again, its story. ?o familiar here,
was unknown there, the unfamiliarity of
libretto Certainly also militating against
an immediate acceptance of the opera.
Here tho Tivoli leader believe'* the au
ditors will see in the work a new "La
Boheme," so far as the kind and amount
of pleasure in Its hearing goes. "It Is
very direct in its descent from the Leon
cavallo of 'I'Pagllaccl,* " says Mr. Steln
dorff. "The humorous side, the comedy
vein, foreshadowed there, the easy melo
diousness of the 'Serenade,' for example,
are all in ripe evidence in 'Zaza.' I my
selfânothing wonderfulâ prophesied this
development of the composer's genius.
No, it Is not a return to the older Italian
echool. 'Zaza" is quite original. But It3
comparative simplicity, the what you
might call 'catchiness' of the melodiesâ
for you carry them away with you on
first hearingâ the more conservative har
mony, the simpler orchestrationâ very
pretty, by the way, all mark it off from
the more complex works of the modern,
Italian opera. That is where the work
Is to me so highly original. There la
much more natural invention shown than
in anything of Mascagnl's. to my mind.
Some delightful 'chansonettes'â absolutely
Frenchâ are sungr behind scenes In the
first actâ a wonderful imitation. And it
is not that these lighter things constitute
the whole of the opera. There is nothing
more powerful in 'rPaKliacci' than tha
scenes between Zaza and her lover. They
are full of dramatic vitality, passion.
"As to the libretto. That almost com
pletely agrees with the story of the play
and has been well arranged by Ullca.
Zaza is a dramatic soprano. De Spada i3
cast for the part, and Bernard, a tenor,
naturally. Ischlerdo will, of course, have
the role. â¢ Gregoretti has the barytone
role of Caspar, Zaza's would-be lover,
and Miss Barker is Florlana, the Â»ou
brette. Marchesinl singa the part of
Zaza's motherâ aunt. I believe, in tho
playâ and Dado la the journalist. Toto.
the child, rjuite an important little part,
will be done by a little Italian girl. It
is a speaking part only."
There Is one thing. None of the artists
in the cast have ever suns in the opera,
and it will be purely a Tivoli production
therefore.
Pluckv little Tivoli!

The only dissenting voiceâ and the crltio
dissents to praise â comes from the Dally
Mail. Says the Mail: "Mr. Denis O'Sulli
van, who has the part of Sergeant Le
febvre, afterward Duke of Dantzic, is a
musician of the first order, but one !a
sorry to see him in this gallery. He Is
quite ineffective and has a wretched part.
One longs to hear him break away from,

lections of him in a comic opera called
'The Highwayman.' It was therefore
very pleasing to welcome him back tÂ»
a sphere in which he has done such good
work. His artistic singing is known to

singers to-day who can render a song
with more artistic point and finish. In
every respect he was excellent as Mare

don of the Californian's unqualified suc
cess in the new romantic light opera.
"The Duchess of Dantzie," produced by
George Edwardes at tho Lyric Theater on
October 17. The opera would appear to
be of unusual interest. It is an operatio
version of Sardou's "Sans Gene." by
Henry Hamilton and Ivan Caryll, the lat
ter well known in the musical comedy
domain. Both librettist "and composer
seem to have done excellent work, and
as a production "The Duchess of Dantzic"
is said to surpass in lavishness anything
that even the lavish George Edwardea
has produced.
In the cpera Mr. O'Sullivan has the
role of Marechale Lefebvre. the husband
of Catherine L'pscher, Madame Sana
Gene. He has received for his work the
friendliest comment from the press. The
Morning Post says:
"As Lefebre Denis O'Sullivan acted with
his usual magnetism and his singing was
Tull of power and charm. The duet with
Sans Gene, 'Do You Remember?* was
one of the most successful numbers and
waa most enthusiastically received."
The Telegraph says: "Mr. Denis O'Sul
livan both as actor and singer was of
great service in the part of Lefebvre, a
rich and welcome heartiness in the best
sense of the word marking all he did."
The Times congratulates Mr. Caryll on
having "such an admirable artist as Denis
O'Sullivan for the Interpretation of his
music."

undignified to maintain the reputation of
the dignified parlor at an anniversary cel

tlTe smoke would Interfere with "Brother
Curley's delicate throat," thereby depriv
ing the guests of considerable amusement,
as he would not be able to entertain with
his "special specialties." President Locke
contributed $5 to the fund to meet the
expenses and the balance required was
contributed by Roche, Allen and Fraser.

During the evening "Prof" Roche while
discussing the banquet proposition spoke
of "Innocuous Iniquity," but was cut short

meant by the phrase, when they reported
that he meant no harm he was allowed

should always remain a bachelor girl.
She prefers not to miss any of the zest
of assisting in the bride's preparations
and probably hopes there will be a fourth
time.
But it* Is wror-c to think that these
vain glories alone account for the society
girl's eagerness to be a bridesmaid, for
there are other important duties which.
In her official capacity, she is only too
tarry to perform for the dear bride-to
be. Of course, there Is no end of delight
In the btuy preparations. The bride's
heme is a rendezvous for her attendants,
who enjoy the most enthusiastic discus
elons. Each In turn assures the bride
that she Is marrying the finest man in
"day. With the first strains of
the weddlnc march guests crane their
necks for the first glimpse of the fluffy
apparitions who attend the bride. In fact,
were Solomon to present himself at this
moment he would not have a ghost of
a chance to be noticed, for all are watch-
Ing with breathless Interest each step of
the bridesmaids walking up the aisle with
a dramatic stride meant to be particu
larly impressive. The last of them, the
maid of honor, is devoured in one eager
glance, for the bride is coming next.
CERTAIN it is that Solomon In
all his glory was not arrayed
like the bridesmaids at a fash

When finally distributed at respectful
distances along the aisle of a dimly light
ed church each bridesmaid dons an ultra
serious facial expression, and in her at
tempt to rise to the'occaslon lades only
the reddest of hair to suggest the last
act of "Zaza." The formidable processiqn
moves forward, each one striving to avoid
walking up the back of an imaginary
court train, when some one giggles, and
all go back and try again. After several
disastrous attempts some one -invariably
tries to think of funerals by way of get
ting serious, but this never works, for at
some time or other she has laughed at a
funeral, even though it may have been
from sheer, nervousness. The sexton is
almost certain to turn out the lights at an
Inopportune moment If he tries to turn on
more. Then there is a sensation, and
every one thinks it is terribly funny. In
fact, everything seems funny at wedding
rehearsals, and laughing is so infectious
that there is very little else done.
Then there is the bride's farewell din
ner to her attendants, whicn must bÂ»
every bit as jolly as the groom's last
bachelor dinner. On this occasion the
do not actually deserve anything more
than their pleasure for their pains.
