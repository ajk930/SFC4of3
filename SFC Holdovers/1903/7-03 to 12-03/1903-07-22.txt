Heartrending Scenes as Assault Is

SOLEDAD, Venezuela. Monday. July 20,
19 a. m.â Since the last dispatch was sent
at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon, the bat
tle between the revolutionary forces at
Ciudad Bolivar and the Venezuelan Gov
ernment army, commanded by General
Gomez, has raged madly. Block after
block v.-as destroyed, the Government
troops entering the city slowly. All the
houses had been barricaded and the rev
olutionists had been forced from fiat roofs
called azotoas.
When the revolutionists finally abandon
ed the houses, after having taken all
that cculd,.be used for barricades or to
otherwise stop the advance of the Gov
ernment troops* they were immediately
occupied \,y the Government, soldiers,
who bored b!g holes In them, so as to
communicate with the next house. The
city appears to have been struck by a
cyclone. .
At the same time General Rivas,
General Gomez's chief lieutenant,
with 2300 men, succeeded in de
stroying a barricade erected
around the Miranda plaza, the key
to the Capitol, where all the sur
vivors of the revolution were con
centrated.
SOLEDAD, Venezuela, Mon
day, July 2O, 7 p. m.â The fight
ing in Ciudad de Bolivar from
I o'clock this afternoon has
been horrible, and at this hour the
only places that still resist the on
set of the government troops are
the jail and the Capitol.
Early in the afternoon the gov
ernment troops, which had re
ceived all the reinforcements
available, together with ammuni
tion, and which numbered in all
5200 men. were ordered to make
a general attack upon all positions
still held by the rebels. At 5
o'clock this afternoon the Zamora,
called the Sebastopol of Ciudad
Bolivar, was stormed and cap
tured. Ninety-four dead rebels
were found inside, among them
being General Azanza, one of the
revolutionary leaders, whose head
had been blown off by a shell. It
is impossible to render an idea- of
the carnage which occurred at this

WASHINGTON, July ZL-Offlclal Wash
ington continues to be somewhat mysti

Paris and which was published to-day.
Count Cassini said that at his interview
with Secretary of State Hay, when the
latter called upon him on Sunday, Juno
28, they only casually mentioned the mat
ter of open ports in Manchuria and that
the call was but an informal one. Wash
ington has been led to believe that the
call of Secretary Hay, which was very
unusual in view of the fact that the Sec
retary of State only on one previous oc
casion had called on an Embassador, was
in the nature of an official call.
The impression, too, was given out. and
that impression was not discouraged by
Count Cassini, that the Manchurian ques
tion had been discussed and /that when
Secretary Hay departed little was left to
be done excepting the designation of the
ports which should be opened.

escaped death in a runaway. He

y^OME. July 21.â The body, of Pope
g Leo to-day reposed In the cham
#<r^ ber where his last death-struggle
Â¦* took place, which for the time
being has been transformed Into
a mortuary' chapel. Late .this afternoon
the body of Pope Leo was embalmed and
clothed in full* pontifical jobes, prepara
tory to the funeral obsequies.
Through the night and early morning
many simple emblems of grief had been
displayed, but the main thoroughfares did
not present a spectacle of general mourn
ing. No flags were half-masted and no
buildings were shrouded In crepe, as
when the Imperial rulers pass away. The
Corso and other busy centers presented
the customary scenes of animation.
It was in the poorer sections of the city
that the evidences of grief were more
manifest. Entering the Borgeo district,
leading to the Vatican, the hum of â¢ex
citement attending the" event was more
apparent. A steady stream of carriages,
bearing Cardinals and diplomats, swung
through the narrow lane called the Via
Borgeo, leading to the piazza of St
Peter's.
Coming now to the piazza of St Peter's
a scene of vital Interest began to unfold
itself. There was not the slightest evi
dence of bustle or confusion. The vast
expanse enclosed within the stately col
onnade looked majestic In Its serenity.
Although groups of people hurried hither
and thither, their presence was complete
ly lost in the Immensity of the whole.
NO SIGNS OF MOURNING.
Nowhere about the . Esplanade was
there the slightest outward sign of
mourning, neither on thej church front nor
on the columns of the dooYs of the Vat
ican. The main entrance of the Vatican
showed the chief evidence of activity.
As the equipages drove up with distin
guished prelates the' heavy iron, chains
continued to l4op back the crowds leaving
a narrow aisle for the arriving digni-
taries. pack of .the chafns were massed
a crowd of. curious sightseers/- The of
ficial presence of the Italian' soldiery was
kept noticeably; in" the background. : -. At
the foot of the stone steps stood an .of
ficer of Italian grenadiers in fatigue uni- ;
form and cap. with. a small detachment
of troops bo broken; Into squads that they*
did not have the appearance uf being in
martial array. With them .were the Vat
ican and municipal troops in somber uni
forms, with broad chapeaux, some tipped
with little olue pompoms. The ponderous
doors of the Vatican were closed. The
only means of ingress was a small open
ing which had been cut through the solid
bronze bas reliefs. 'Behind this tiny en
trance, only wide enough to admit a single
person, stood a Swiss guard with fixed
bayonet. As the Cardinals and diplomats
came up they went to the tiny door,
knocked and were admitted. Outside these
favored few the exclusion was absolute.
PREPARING LEO'S TOMB.
Inside the magnificent church of St.
Peter could be heard the sound of ham
mer and chisel already preparing Leo's
temporary tomb. A massive wooden plat
form had been rolled into the basilica,
reaching half way to the celling, to the
left of the nave. Around this rough'
staging stood a crowd waichlng a half
dozen workmen prepare the niche in
which Leo's coffin will soon rest. High
above the niche they had driven into the
solid masonry three enormous steel hooks
from which the tackle will be operated to
hoist the coffin into placo. The resting
place for the casket-; Is a marble slab,
about fifteen feet! above the pavement,
forming the upper casement of one of the
massive door*. On either side are great
marble cupjds. while the light comes
dimly from above from two domes sur
rounded by exquisite mosaics, one show
ing the apostles and saints and the other
an angelic chorus. Two workmen pound-
Pope Rejoices Over Triumph of His Peace Policy.
WORKMEN INVADE CHAPEL.
Within tho right nave still another
preparation for the Pope's obsequies was
going on. This was the preparation of
the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament for re
ceiving his body after Its removal from
the Vatican. Cardinal Respighl, the Vi
car of Rome, had given orders for these
arrangements. Although Cardinal Oreglia
has supreme command of the interests of
the church, it is Cardinal Respighi who
has been given immediate charge of the
personal affairs relating to the dead Pope,
Accordingly, the beautiful chapel was for
the time being invaded by sweepers and
cleaners, who poured buckets of water on
the mosaic pavement and began scouring
it. . The front of the chapel is cut off from
the main church by a massive trestle,
through which the faithful can look upon
the altar within. This is of solid brass,
with heroic brass kneeling angels. Be
neath It is a space where Leo's coffin will
be deposited when it comes from the Vati
can. This space Is so small that the foot
of the casket will extend to the iron trel
lis. The purpose of this arrangement is
to carry out the ancient ceremony by
which the actual foot of the dead Pontiff
will extend through the Iron barriers, to
permit the kneeling, faithful to approach
and kiss the last remnant of former pa pah
authority through It. This morning people
crowded about the grating and gazed at
the preparations going on within.
ed and called out .their commands In
strange contrast with >the solemn sur
roundings. VThe interior of the church
was as, yet undraped with mourning. The
massive crimson hangings had been re
moved,'-Bringing out" the ghastly white
ness pf the marble nave.* At .the further
end could .be seen groups 'of priests,
kneeling about the tomb of St. Peter,
where scores of tapers. burn unceasingly.
Only the usual masses were said during
the morning, as the ceremonials Jn con
nection with the death of the Pope have
yet to be arranged.

has taken no steps to exert any influence
upon the conclave, and it is believed the
other Catholic States will adopt the same
course. It is improbable that a change
in the head of the Holy See will result m
any change in the relations of France to
the Vatican, unless the new Pope proves
to be another Pius IX, but that is a mat
ter whereon it is impossible to express
an opinion until the new Pope Is electeu.

â¢ \ These cost 13 cents per pound to manufacture, but

" PRESTO " quick - flour needs no Baking Powder, and
very little " Shortening."
It is the finest flour milled in America, being rich in
Gluten (muscle-former) with a comparatively low per cent-
age of Starch (fat) , while Baker's Flour, for instance, is
chiefly Starch, with little Gluten.
"PRESTO" quick-flour has the exact proportions of
Cream Tartar, Soda, and Salt, that such flour needs,* al-
ready blended uniformly into it, by machinery.
These chemicals are the purest made, mixed with the
flour when they are fresh and strong, and then sealed up
in air-tight packages that Grocers retail at 10c and 25c
The very best flour, and the purest Cream of Tartar
and Soda are thus sold in "PRESTO," at the price of
common flour, combined with Baking Powder, â why?
Becauseâ" PRESTO " carries only a cTVKllcr's profit
on the whole product, instead of a Druggists profit on the

Then, there's the great labor saving, and the certainty

The white veil was then removed from
the dead man's face, revealing the cameo
like features of the departed Pope, ren
dered sharper and more transparent by
death. So lifelike was the body that
those present, half expected Leo to raise
his hand in the familiar gesture of bless-'
ing.
A moment of breathless silence ensued
and then the Cardinal Camerllngro, taking
the aspcrsorium, sprinkled the late Pon
tiff with holy water and said in a firm
voice: "Gioacchlno" (the Christian name
of the deceased Holy Father). When
there was no answer the same word was
repeated three times, louder and louder,
after which, turning to the kneeling Car
dinals, the Camerlingo solemnly an
nounced: \
"Papa vera mortuus est" (the Pope is
really dead).
As the words were uttered there arose
though private. It was conducted
with great pomp and was most impres

Rome, numbering twenty-nine, assembled
in the Apostolic Palace to view the re
mains of the late Pope Leo XIII and to
officially pronounce him dead. Cardinal
Oreglia, dean of the Sacred College and
Camerlingo of the Holy Roman Church,
had to put ' aside Cardinal's robes as a
sign of deep mourning and was gowned
entirely in violet. The other Cardinals
Vore crimson robes with violet collars,*

â¢Within the death-chamber the body lay
with a white veil over the face, on the
bed, surrounded by Franciscan peniten
tiaries, wiille outside the Noble Guard
maintained a solemn vigil. The pro
found silence was broken only by the
chanting of prayers for the dead. Into
this solemn presence came. the mourning
procession of Cardinals, who, kneeling,
silently prayed. Then the prelates rev
erently looked on while Cardinal Oreglia
approached the remains. For this morn
ing's function the Pope's bedroom had
been transformed into a kind of mortuary
chapel, with the altar at one end, having
in the center a crucifix surrounded by
six lighted candles. Four candles stood

KAISER EXPRESSES GRIEF.
The Cardinals present In Rome met this
morning, under Cardinal Oreglia, in a
preparatory congregation held In the Hall
of the Consistory. Oreglia communicated
to them tho first instructions he has
given since the death of < the Pooe, in
forming them of the numerous messaged
of condolence received from all parts of
the wcrld^ and of the universal mourning
for Leo XIII. An exchange of ideas took
I lace regarding the ceremonies preceding
the conclave. When Cardinal Oreglia ask
ed for the advice of one of the Cardinals
pifsent the latter replied:
"It is difficult to give advice. Indeed,
you must teach us what to do. as none
of us has ever participated in a con
clave."
Cardinal Nettlo,, the patriarch of Lisbon,
who, when he arrives, will take over hl3
own duties.
The government of the Catholic church
has been officially assumed by Cardinal
Oreglia as dean of the Sacred College
and as dean of the Cardinal Bishops. He
will be assisted by the deans of the other
two orders of- Cardinals, Cardinal Macchi
of the Cardinal Deacons and Cardlna'
Rampolla for the "Cardinal Priests, the

CARDINALS ARE CONVENED.
Cardinal Rampolla intended to leave the
Vatican last night, immediately after tho
death of the Pope, when, having officially
announced the demise of the Pontiff to
the diplomatic body accredited ' to the
Vatican and to the papal nuncios, with
instructions to have the news communi
cated to the various foreign rulers, he
considered his duties as papal secretary
of state -to have been ended. Rampolla
was on the point of leaving when Car
dinal Oreglia insistently begged him to re
main in the- apartment- he. had occupied
for more than sixteen years and the sec
retary of state acceded to the request.
The Vicar of Rome, Cardinal Pletro
Respighl, has caused to be attached to tho
doors of the churches an announcement of
the death of Pope. Leo, with instructions
regarding the prayers to be offered and
also giving information about the fun
eral cervices. ;
from the kneeling Cardinals a sighâ a
tribute paid to the late Pontiff by these
princely heads of the church.
After this, in voices trembling with
emotion, the ranking Cardinals recited
the De Profundls. gave absolution and
sprinkled the body with holy water.
FAMOUS BINO REMOVED.
Following the ceremony of the recogni
tion of the death of the Pope by the Sac
red College came another, shorter, but no
less significant and symbolic. On Leo's
finger was the famous fisherman's ring,
which the' Camerlingo, with a whispered
prayer, drew gently off, and which later
will be broken in the presence of the Car
dinals, reset and presented to the new
Pope when he is. elected. / ;
The ring is of very great antiquity. It
is even said to have belonged to St. Peter
himself. It is a stone of little value, cut
with the scene of St. Peter drawing in
fishing nets. It was first used about the
year 1265, but for secret documents it was
only used later. Officially It is one of the
symbols of office most prized by the
church. Although lost two or three times,
it has always been recovered.

Members of the Sacred College.

Gibbons departed for Rome he left with
Rev. Dr. "William Fletcher, rector of the
cathedral, an outline of the services hÂ»
desired held in the churches of this prov

Catholic churches throughout the United
States. The plan is set forth in the fol
lowing statement given by Dr; Fletcher
to-day:
Prior to his departure for Rome his Eminence
desired that a solemn pontifical requiem mass
be celebrated In the Cathedral, to which all
the Bishops ot this province and the reverend
clergy of. the Archdiocese will be Invited. The
mass In the Cathedral will, take place on the

Cardinal Gibbons' Wish Will Be
PONTIFICAL REQUIEM MASSES.
On Thursday the wholo people of Roma
will be allowed to view the body of thÂ«
Pontiff, while requiem masses will be
celebrated in the different chapels. The
same morning the third meeting of the
congregation will take place. The congre

Julia chapel.
In the chapel choir, where the inter
ment will occur, the bier must enter head

congregations will continue.
Three grand funeral services will oc

and in the evening the remains will be'
transported to the basilica of St. Peter.
where they will be taken charge of by

In consequence of Leo XIIFs long
reign, these parties have entirely disap
j!rar.ed. In the present conclave there
will be only one Cardinal, Cardinal Oreg
lia. who was not appointed by Pope, Leo.
As a result of these changes, the ap
proaching concla\"e will be much more
under the influence of individual candi
dates than in the past, rendering it im
possible to forecast the election with any
degree of certainty. It is considered
highly probable that the new Pope will

PASTIES HAVE DISAPPEARED.
Then, there were parties composed of
cardinals appointed by the same Pope,
Â¦who" usually ranged themselves into
separate bodies. In addition to the mem

the Pope who had then just passed away,
there were usually considerable numbers
chosen by his predecessor, and, even a
Jew nominated by the Pope preceding
him.

An Embassudor accredited to the Vati

the conditions prevailing In the past are

minister, who claimed that McRae had
alienated the affections of his wife, filed

made against him by Selby. and asks
that the minister's suit be dismissed on
the ground that his complaint does not

that McRae ruined his home and de

The Government commander, seeing
that only the artillery could make a

ordered twelve guns to open fire on them,
and at the eame time the Venezuelan

so as to bring Its guns to bear rffectively
on the city, opened ! fire. The soldiers
have had no food for two days, no am

bravely, was the first to order the at

At 8 o'clock this morning the Govern

of their forces north and south and hav

A legal contest was- Â«-aged In Judge
Murasky's court yesterday between
factions of the Republican party. Rang
td on the eide of those who at present
hold the balance of power w*cre Abe Ruef,
Tom Rlordan and Henry Ach. Opposing
them were N. C. Coghlarv Colonel
Thomas Eddy and Martin Kelly.
The war was brought on by the petition
of Kelly for a writ of mandate compelling
the Board of Election Commissioners to
allow his faction of the party, the "regu
lar Republican organization." a place on
ihe ticket at the coming primary election.
The petition was demurred to and Judge
Murasky took the matter under subr
n:ission.
Attorney Tom Riordan spoke for an
hour on the rights of political parties
end gave numerous reasons why Kelly's
petition should not be granted. His
Xirincipal objection was based on the name
adopted by the Kelly faction. It sounded,
he eaid. too much like Regular Republican
party, and was therefore misleading and
liable to cause confusion.
"Confusion," said Rlordan. "was not
desirable and It was to avoid confusion
that the primary law was enacted."
At the afternoon seslon Ruef gave
pome more reasons why Kelly's faction
Fhould not be on the ticket. He also
attacked the method used to obtain a
rlace on the ballot, holding that the
present proceedings were useless, claim
ing that mandamus will not He in such a
case.
Ruef and Riordan were answered by
Coghlan and Eddy, Coghlan holding that
the present proceedings were proper, that
mandamus would lie. He also said that
the name was not misleading, and said
Jhat to call It such and to say It would
confuse the voter was a reflection upon
the intelligence of the man who uses the
stamp.
Eddy closed the argument for the Kelly
fide of the case by quoting from
the opinions of the Supreme
Justices. who had declared every
primary election law up to the law of
1901 unconstitutional. He said that every
voter had a right to object to the way
in which his party was managed, and
that there was no law to prevent him
organizing another branch and wresting
from those in control the management.
lie practically admitted that such was
the object of Kelly, and said the Election
Commissioners were not, by any law or
net. given the power to prevent such
action ats ayiy elector chose to take.
Henry Ach closed the day"s proceedings
by an attack upon the petitioners, saying
that the selection of the name borne by
the Kelly faction was an attempt to com
mit a fraud upon the public, and that It
was done simply" for the purpose of caus
ing confusion in the Republican ranks.
To-day at 3 a. m. Judge Murasky will
hear Kcliy'e second action, a suit for an
injunction restraining the Registrar from
placing on the ticket the names of the
delegates selected by the regular party.
The suit is brought on the ground tnat
the regulars have no governing com
mittee, and are, therefore, not entitled to
recognition.

thorized anybody to "acquire land for this com

In one of the newspapers on Monday there
appeared an artlc'e relating to the Jumping of
oyster lands In Alameda County by ' alleged
pirat<s.
These alleged Dirates have even Jumped land
to which the l'acific Oysjer Company has abso
lute title.
i This Jumping has been done without our
knowlff!j;f> or conoent and our company would
not eunder any circumstances stoop to eucls
methods of acquiring property. _ -
The Pacific Oy8t*r Comparty has bought and
pntd for every acre of Ha land In San Fran

tain William Roberts. Henry Â«â¢ Martin. Mm.
M. Martin ard Han* Mathlenen. also all of the
right ami title of the heirs of the late Peter
Mathiesen to all of their claims.
Both Overton and Daggett are reported
to be men of ample means and it is hard
to understand exactly " what motive in
spires them in their present actions.
The Pacific Oyster Company in sub
stantiation of its position in the premises,
make? the following statement: ,'
EXACT MOTIVE UNKNOWN.
Roberts originally valued his 1500 acres
at f40,000, but quite recently offered to
sell for $1500, The Smith corporation ap
parently thought even this sum too
much and preferred taking the property,
if it could, by. means *of surveys under
new. filings, which, are now being prose
cuted under the ''protection of what the
San â¢-.Lorprtzoitcs call the ."armed; pirate
sloop."
The Smith faction to vindicate its ac
tions in the premises say that "the Rob
erts faction, has not lived up to the con
ditions of the act under which It was
granted Its lands, not, having complied
with the act.regarding the encouragement
of the cultivation of oysters."
When Overton and Daggett bought into
the Pacific Oyster Company they thor
oughly examined into the titles of tho
lands of that "company, and to make as
surance doubly sure, suggested that the
company, procure quit claim deeds of the
property from the original files of 1S79.
This was done. A short time since, when
Overton and- Daggett found they could
no lyct full swing 'of the Pacific Oyster
iirrVyariy, they announced that they were
d.es.!t:u?.ed with the management of the
'-.enc-'-n and wanted to sell out to those
holdir>Â» the majority of the stock, stating
as a reiiori that, "your way is not ours.".
Now com.8 the scheme in which they are
stated io be the alleged ringleaders. In
defiance of their belief that the title of
the Roberts-Martin contingent claims are
good, they not only have 'filed on the 1500
acres of tho Roberts claim, but have also
jumped 160 acres of the ' Pacific Oyster
Company's "property in which they them
selves own two-fifths.
WILLING' TO ACCEPT TITLE.
I The title irf* these tide lands was vested
in 1879 Jn W. Roberts, II. B. Martin, Mrs.
M. Martin and H. and P. Mathiesen under
what is known as the "oyster act."
The . real purpose of the owners or
managers of the "armed pirate sloop"
that is occupying the attention of those
Interested in- the oyster beds adjacent to
West San Lorenzo is not at present fully
apparent. The alleged owner of the armed
slopp-ls supposed to be a corporation
called' >he Smith Oyster Company, the
principal stockholders being I*. Wj Smith,
C. V P. Overtpn and J. K. Daggett. The
two last 'named are stockholders in the
Pacific Oyster Company, but this com
pany indignantly disclaims any connec
tion â¢ whatever with the present piratical
proceedings.
From the statement of L. P. Eaton, the
secretary of the Pacific Oyster Company,
It appears that this > company was organ
ized early in 1500 and capitalized at $100,
000. Its property adjoins the lands in con
tention and is valued .it from $40,000 to
$50,000. I The officers are , C. P. Overton,
president; S. U. Darboe, vico president,
and L.. P. Eaton, secretary. It appears
that, Overton and Daggett own two-tilths
of the stock of the Paqtflc Oyster Com
pany and have been' buying out all the
small stockholders, with the intention, if
possible, of obtaining complete control of
the plant. Failing in this, they, deter
mined to start out and secure oyster
lands for themselves.

The Old Homestead.
BY HENBY P. SMITH.
Free Oil Painting
With Next Sunday's .Call.
There is nothing in the wide, wide world quite so appealing as home.
Be it ever so humble there is no spot like the habitation of the individual
man. Rich or poor, high or low, good or bad, prince or pauper, the in-
clination is for home, and any picture that represents home ties or home
features touches the warmest spot in the hearts of all men and women.
Apropos of this, The San Francisco Call presents as its art supple-
. ' . ment next Sunday an oil painting which is a perfect reproduction in color
of the celebrated picture by Henry P. Smith entitled "The Old Home-
stead." It represents a New England farmhouse and possesses artistic
qualities of the highest order. Its composition is well balanced, its color
harmonious and there is a satisfying fidelity in the completeness with
which the details are elaborated. There is an element of outdoors in the .
whole beautiful scheme. The farmhouse, with its antique, cozy character,
its great elm tree in front, its rich greens surrounding and its air of
shade, comfort and coziness are peculiarly attractive. . . f _
Smith, the artist, is one of the most successful of New York pic- .
ture-makers and he is one of the most cultivated men in the art world.
Hitherto he has devoted himself largely to Venetian scenesâ pictures of .
architectural wonders of the Old World. The present effort is an innova-
tion; it passes from the grandeur of Granada and Seville to the homely
comforts of a New England homestead. The change shows great versatil-
ity in the artist and has in it an atmosphere that is peculiarly graceful
California readers will be especially interested in this attractive pic-
ture of Eastern homeliness and natural luxury, conveying as it does a de-
V licious sense of coolness that seems to exude from the canvas.

keeps its word, it will bringdown enough

room to nearly fill the room. .- Â¦ :_ ...
The" case is ? taking much longer, to be
heard than was originally '/expected. â¢Â¦'-: At
the morning recess ; the opposing counsel
had. a short talk and as a result : came
to the conclusion that the case would
not be closed until , about /August 10.'- ;
Willcutt clearly showed that he had
the patience of Job. Llvernash would
ask him the same questions a dozen times
and each answer would come as distinct
ly and clearly as the first time"., Llver
nash attempted tor prove that the , time
vtable used by the men was manipulated
by the United Railroads In such a way
that it was impossible for a man to make
any overtime. While cross-examining
j Willcutt on this subject, Llvernash asked
the secretary if he would produce the pay
sheets of the platform men from March,
1902, to March, 1903. ' The company has
produced already the sheets for one
month and Attorney Moore thought this
ought to be sufficient. -..
"What Is it you want?" asked Moore.
"You want to sec what the actual earn
ings of the platform men have been . for
a whole year?"
"It will be quite a job." suggested Will
cutt. ."to produce all these sheets."
' "Everything seems quite a Job when 1
ask for it." answered Llvernash. ... - r
"Air right, all .right,',' said Attorney,
Moore. "Bring them all down, if it takes
ahorse and cart to fetch them. Do you
want- them this very minute, because ; if
you do we will get them," -said Moore..
"Oh don't be silly., about It," " replied
Llvernash. "To-morrow will do." 'Â¦;. -
Hour after hour yesterday Attorney
Llvernash, r representing the Carmen's
Union, plied Secretary Willcutt , of the
United Railroads with questions at the
arbitration proceedings which are now
pending between the street car corpora

Attorney Hiram W. Johnson, who is
representing Horst. thinks he has a clear
case agaltrst.the defendant. "I am con
vinced that Mr. Horst has been wronged."
said Johnson, "and we are going to fight
this case to the limit. I Jiave thoroughly
investigated the matter and there is'no
question in my .mind that the Â¦ How
ard Company owes Horst tire $6000 for
which he is about to sue. '
"He will ask $*500 for the loss of his
barley from the sacks, $900 which he lost
in false weights and $600 which he has
already 6pent in trying to straighten out
the case. Mr. Horst shipped most of this
barley to England and the firms to whom
It was consigned complained that all the
shipments were short."
John L. Howard, president of the How
ard Company, takes the matter very cool
ly and states that the firm is In no way
indebted to Horst. "All warehouses de
duct a certain amount from each sack of
grain 6tored with them," said Mr. How
ard, "but when the cleaning-up time
comes they allow the firms who do busi
ness with them this amount back.
"We offered to settle with Horst and
give him just what was due him. but he
refused, and wanted four times the
amount coming to him. As far as the
other charges go, I will simply state that
they are false ar.d will prove it in open
court. The rase is In the hands of our
attorney. Sidney Smith, and he will look
out for our Interests in this matter."
Horst states that he Indignantly refused
to settle the case for anything like that
sum. He demanded that Howard pay
him $4500 for the grain deducted from his
*acks and $900 which he alleges he lost
by short weights.
HOWARD DENIES FRAUD.
] According to Horn. Howard admitted
i that it was the custom of his company
, to deduct two pounds from every five
! sacks stored in the warehouse. He ad
mitted, according to Horst. that tfils had
been done in his case, and then agreed
; to pay the latter $1200. which Howard
) said _waÂ« the value of the barley deducted
j from Horst's pile.
When the time came for settling up
the accounts Horst says he discovered
that the Howard Company had deducted
two pounds from every five sacks of the
barley stored in the warehouse. Horst
began an Investigation at once -~d states
that he discovered he had been cheated
in his dealings with the warehouse com
pany. He then made many vain attempts
to have an understanding vith the How
ard Company, but. according to his state
ments, he could get no iatisfaction. Two
days ago. he says, he went to see How
ard about the matter and demanded an
explanation from the latter in regard to
the alleged falsifying of the weights and
deduction of the barley from the sacks
stored in the warehouse.
HORST'S ACCUSATIONS.
According to Horst. his firm delivered
to the Howard Company 88.000 sacks of
barley to be stored with them. Shortly
afterward. Horst alleges, he discovered
that the barley had been weighed in false
ly and that he was .rendered receipts by
the Howard Company on these urilrue
figures.
dds interest to the case.
The suit will be watched ' with r great
interest by the grain dealers and the gen
eral public as well, for, coming right on
the heels of the Epplnger scandal, much
more attention will be paid to it than
at anv other time. The fact that the
principals in the suit are well known and
highly esteemed in commercial circles
Another crain scandal is likely to de
velop frÂ«m a suit filed yesterday in the
Superior Court by H. Clemmens Horst,
the well known dealer in hops and bar
ley # against the, Howard Company, the
warehouse corporation. He asks 56000
damages, claiming that the Howard Com
pany withheld from him a large amount
of barley and that the grain was falsely
weighed. Balfour, Guthrie & Co. are
made co-defendants In the case, as the
grain was stored in their warehouse,
though Horst did business directly with
the Howard Company.' ;>.

Weekly Call. $1; jeriYear |The large' and distinguished community of highr
waymen which thrives among us and prospers in ill
gotten" gain seems no lpngerUo be Â¦content in* simp'le
robbery, but , insists' that every victim shall b\Â» 'beaten
and abused as : well as despoiled. M idnight maraud
er^ of the mask arid bludgeon might. take a little
friendly advice and' reflect; that- there' is a stage at
which the worm will turn.
Russia has resorted to the unusual and apparently
unnecessary precaution of denying a rumor in refer
ence to her intentions in her foreign policy. If the
St. Petersburg Government purposes to refute all the
rumors which arc circulated regarding its affairs it
will have to organize a bureau of denials more form
idable and more industrious and indefatigably ener
getic than ail her other public departments combined.
REPORTS published some time ago to the ef
fect that Mr. Cannon would oppose all ef
forts at currency legislation during the com
ing session of Congress and would make use of
the issue to bring to a test the relative powers of
the House and the Senate appear to have been
exaggerations. Cannon believes the present currency
system to be sufficient for the needs of the country
and willoppose legislation in the way of reform or
alteration of any kind.' He believes in ; letting well
enough alone, and on the currency question as on
that of the tariff will stand pat. It is not true, how
ever, that he will use the powers of the Speakership
to oppose the efforts of the reformers, nor will he
undertake to make it an issue between the House
and the Senate.
The correction of the original report clears the
situation. It is now. evident that the controversy
over the currency will be waged upon the merits of
the issue and that there will be no outside antagon
isms brought into it. Under such conditions it
seems probable that some kind of reform providing
for an elastic currency will be adopted. Senator Gal
linger of New Hampshire in a rccent'speech at .Con
cord declared positively that such legislation would
be had. He is reported as saying: "Don't get dis
couraged. You are probably business men and feel
the pinch of money, but I tell you that when we get
back to Congress next November we will pass a cur
rency bill that will remove the pinch."
It is not yet possible to forecast â¢ what form of
elasticity will be recommended by the committee of
the Senate that is now investigating the, subject. A
new plan is reported to have been submitted to the
committee and to have found favor with Senator Al
lison. A dispatch from Washington giving an ac-r
count of it says: "The plan authorizes the issue of.,
additional currency by- national banks, up to 25 per

Professor Herrick of Chicago, who has shed his
intellectual light upon the summer school at Berkeley,
is said to be cynical, satirical and unmerciful to the
teachers with whom he comes in contact. Independ
ent of the professor's desire to shine in the only quali
ties he probably possesses, some concession must be
made to his Chicago connections. Anybody coming
from Chicago may be excused for anything disagree
able.

the ground that it is not slanderous to the average
man to call him after a jackass who has the advan

To Raise Church Funds.
Hypnotism, odic force, suggestion and astral in
fluence may be pleaded as the reason for this change.
But the real reason is the hopeless vulgarizing of life
and the sacrifice of all that was once dear because
personal and confidential to the desire for publicity
and sensation. *--/
IT is the cge of things mysterious. In physics we
have the X-ray and radium, the new force that
transcends all others and seems capable of giving
off destructive dynamic influence without diminution
of its own bulk and power. The capacity of the
atoms which enter into cosmic matter is being in
quired into, and man walks upon forces that in
proper crystallization hold the planet together, but
by atomic changes may explode it into fine flinders.
All this is the mysterious of the physical. The
mysteries of the psychological are far greater. Gen
erations ago Mr. Mcsmer made the world familiar
with odic force, but went no further in its application
than to amuse audiences by making clergymen pick
each othrrs" pockets and grave citizens stand on their
heads. It was to modern hypnotism what the X-ray
is to radium. Hypnotism is mesmerism with sug
gestion added in surh way as to make seemingly nor
mal people cut capers and commit crimes under the
control of their "influence." Perhaps this newly dis
covered influence may account for ancient witchcraft.
It is written in the annals of witch-burning in New
England that one j-oung fellow procured the burn
ing at the ?take of a girl who had rejected his
amatory suit because, he said, he was unable to sleep
'Â¦or thinking oi her, and therefore he must be be
witcv^ and he probably was, but not in the way
he thought.
Hypnotism has had many things laid at its door.
People zrra.^ned for crime have pleaded hypnotic
suggestion, ut.<ier which they have committed mur
der and theft.
A local paper r^w gives full-page publicity, with
pictures and interviews, to another phase of hypno
ti*m. It is accused of having broken an engagement
between two young people! This is the most serious
charge yet made against it. The course of true love
was running as smooth as. molasses, when suddenly
it became as rough as the breakers on Columbia
River bar and turbid as a slickens-bearing stream,
and then in a jiffy it was all off between Jack and Jill,
and its centrifugal force sent them apart.
There is something, however, more serious than
hypnotic force in this case. We who had the simple,
old-fashioned training were taught to believe that
the domestic reljLtVons and the proceedings antecedent
to the foundation of a family and Â§ a home were so
intensely personal that the papers and the public had
nothing to -d o with them. In those wholesome days
it was a of decent self-respect to preserve in
violate t^he confidences of the person, the heart, the
bomr. an d tnc family. All this seems to be passing
aw ay- The affairs of the heart are given glaring pub
'licity, and the parties most interested in their confi
dential nature blab volubly to reporters and give up
their pictures to illustrate the story. Things once
sacred are publicly discussed as if they were no more
sentimental than the purchase of a chicken in the
market or trading horses at the crossroads.
Talk of romance' She has become a painted jade,
a mixture of gossip and hussy, discussed by the par
ties mo?t concerned as freely as if she were a milch
cow, a racehorse or a rabbit-chasing hound. AH re
serve is rudely set aside. The down is rubbed off the
peach and the bloom from the grape, and vulgarity
sits in the blare of publicity, where once rose the
shaded shrine of domestic and personal privacy and
decency.

' The Liberals, moreover, are not the only elements
of the people who are preparing candidates, com
mittees and programmes for an immediate election in
case one should be called. The supporters of Cham
berlain are equally, active. A recent dispatch from
London says: "Enormous funds, are being obtained
from British sympathizers which will' enable* rMr.
Chamberlain's candidates to be run in all constituen
cies where the Ministerialist is anti-Chamberlainite.
Two hundred Ministerialists, therefore, who have. up
to now been hesitating, are faced with the dilemma
of having cither to accept Mr. Chamberlain's pro
posals or be opposed by Chamberlainite candidates,
who have a good chance of slipping in between them
and the opposition candidates." .
When the Liberals are ready and Chamberlain is
ready it will not be easy for Balfour to intervene and
prevent an immediate conflict. Moreover, the issue is
rapidly taking definite form. While neither Chamber
lain nor any one else has presented the public with
a specific programme of protection, showing to what
extent it is proposed to carry the new policy, the
ceaseless discussion of the subject is gradually
surely bringing the question to one of economic prin
ciple. The Liberals will undertake to represent the
protection policy as a scheme to tax the food of the
people. They have already begun to term the pro
} tectionists "dearloafers" and to insist that the Cham
berlain policy will increase the price of every loaf of
bread consumed in the kingdom. On the other. hand,
Chamberlain's supporters arc busily engaged in circu
lating statistics showing how British industry suffers
under free trade and how work and wages would be
increased under a protective system!
The issue, then, appears to ( have been made up,
and the contending factions arc rapidly forming for
Uhe struggle. It is therefore not improbable that the
executive committee. of the London Liberal Federa
tion is right and that a general election is imminent.
It may even come this fall.
jl CCORDING to the Westminster Gazette the
l\ executive committee of the London Liberal
*Â¦ *Â¦ Federation has submitted to the council, qf
the federation a report on the political situation, cJos
ing with the words: "There can be.no doubt that a
general election is imminent, and every Liberal as
sociation that is worthy of the name should be fully
prepared with candidate, committee and programme
before the present month may have expired."
It may be that the report, is nothing more than an
effort to revive the zeal of the rank and file of the
party by raising , expectations that an election is at
hand, but there are evidences that the statement is
not altogether an electioneering dodge. 'The issue
raised by Chamberlain's proposal for the establish
ment of a protective tariff for the United -Kingdom
has given rise, to so keen an agitation that it is quite
possible the Ministry may be forced to appeal to the
country. It is true that Balfour is doing air he can
to hold his party together and to tide over the crisis
by appointing a committee of inquiry irito the in
dustrial conditions of the time, but there are signs
that the people will not be willing to wait for the
committee to report. They desire to pass upon the
issue themselves, and as public opinion has a large
control over Parliament, the Ministry may be com
pelled to go to the country much sooner than it de-
CHAMBERLAIN'S CAMPAIGN.

During the recent visit to city of
Frank P. Sargent. Commissioner General
of Immigration, it was found that cer
tain attorneys engaged in the business of
landing Chinese through the bureau and
the courts were in the habit of obtaining
writs of habeas corpus for their clients
before the officers of the Chinese bureau
had an opportunity of examining, much
less passing upon, the claims of the im
migrants. The object was to have the
applicants taken to the County Jail and
coached. . It was found also that the cal
endar of United States Court Commis
sioner, Heacoch was incumbered with ha
beas corpus cases awaiting trial. .
In many of these cases, the subjects of
which had been denied a landing. Judge
Heacock found the documentary and
other evidence without a flaw, and often
gave expression to his surprise at the
action of the Chinese bureau. A case in
point was that of a Chinese girl claiming
to be a native American returning to thia
country a short time ago. She had
brought, with her a "return certificate"
made out here on her departure for Chi
na, bearing her /photograph, her name
and description i/nd the seal of the bu
reau. It was admitted that the paper
and the photograph were genuine, that
the photograph was that of the applicant
and that it had been placed upon the cer
tificate before the seal of the bureau had
been impressed upon it. In other words,
the girl had made out a clean cut case
and Judge Hearock -so decided and al
lowed her to land. Chinese Inspector John
Lynch was present on behalf of the bu
reau and on being interrogated by Assist
ant United States Attorney Duncan E.
McKlnlay as to the reason, if any, why
the bureau had denied a landing, 'failed
to give any satisfactory reply.
Such peculiar cases as this gave rise to
a rumor several months ago that the bu
reau had decided to deny a landing to all
Immigrants claiming to be native Amerl-.
cans, no matter what their credentials,
and to compel the Immigrants to apply
for writs of habeas corpus and thus
throw the responsibility upon United
States Court Commissioner Heacock. Unit
ed States Immigrant Commissioner Hart
North, who has been in charge of the bu
reau since July 1, was asked as 1 to the
truth or falsity of the rumor and replied
that there was no truth in It, so far as
he was concerned. He sajd he had in
structed his deputy Chinese inspector,
Charles Methan, to be very strict in en
forcing the provisions of the exclusion
act and to require the best evidence In
all cases. Mr. Meehan also denied the
truth of the rumor. He stated that the
cause for every denial of an application
to land was marked on the records. In
June of this year the bureau landed for
ty-two native-born Chinese and eleven in
July, he said.
The number Qf Chinese habeas corpus
cases In- Commissioner Heacock's court
has become so large that the entire time
of some one of. the United States Dis
trict Attorneys ia taken up in their con
sideration. For this reason a recom
mendation has been made to the law de
partment that another Assistant United
States Attorney be appointed to give his
exclusive time and attention to Chinese
cases coming under the exclusion act.
The matter was brought to the attention
of Commissioner General Sargent recent
ly and received his approval.
"A revolutionary proposition looking to
ward the suspension of the writ of habeas
corpus without the constitutional condi
tion of martial law will be made by Unit
ed States District Attorney Marshall B.
Woodworth to United States District
Judge de Haven on their return from
their vacation. Judge de Haven will be
asked to refuse to grant writs of habeas
corpus to Chinese immigrants claiming
to be natives and citizens of the United
States, unless it shall be shown that the
Chinese bureau has denied a landing to
the applicants. This request will be made
under" instructions "from the Treasury De
partment.

So, feeling himself hampered everywhere else, and
even the witness of frivolities in the body of the
church, it is no wonder that, turning to the New
World as a shepherd thinking of his distant flock, he
said, "I am Pope only in the United States." This
meant that under our system of absolute religious
freedom, in which Rome, Lhassa and Mecca have
equal right and privilege, he could devote his highly
spiritual quality to the gpvernment of his church and
was not diverted from things spiritual to things tem
poral. In this country h'e had the warm and enthu
siastic love of his Catholic people and the sincere
respect of all Christians and of Jew and Gentile alike.
In his affectionate ascription to this repablic one
reads his high conception of the Papacy as a spir
itual office only, and so it appeared in a fashion
as his ascription to the division of church and state.
Feeling that he was in reality Pope only in the United
States, he praised as none of his predecessors had
the separation of church and state as the best for
both. Around him were the ruins of the former
union of church and state, and everywhere built on
them a historic antagonism to the Papacyâ England
with the denunciatory clause in her coronation oath,
Germany with the May laws and Â¦ France with her
disestablishment of the orders^ all celebrating with
violent effusion the end of that union between church
and state, which our constitution makes forever im
possible here, and here only was the great Leo
Pope in that sense which seemed to him the very
essence of the office.
Of course his successor will be an Italian. That is
the. policy of the church. Originally adopted to
keep the Holy See at Rome and emphasized by the
exile to Avignon, it has in later years been seen as
a greater necessity to guard Rome as the seat of the
church. All of its traditions are there, and if trans
ferred it would be. stripped of its romance, its high
sentiment, its boary* associations. So a majority of
the Cardinals are Italians, and one. hears but little
any more of the contests between the Montanists and
the Ultramontanists over the control of, the Sacred
Leo will have a countryman for his successor, but
there may be many Popes before one comes again
with, the peculiar, kindly and gentle quality of this
friend of mankind.
THE death of a Pope is of a different significance
now from thnt 01 such an event in pa r -..agc*.
While much controversy has been cau.*d by
the Joss of Papal temporalities, and there be those
that believe that the fullness of his spiritual primacy
of the world can "only be when united to the tem
poral, sovereignty of Rome, yet there are others who
arc convinced that the loss of temporal power has
increased the spiritual influence of the Papacy. Leo
XIII maintained the attitude toward thejoss of the
temporalities that was assumed by his more militant
predecessor, Pius IX, but his spiritual and political
diplomacy was of a much finer and more gracious
quality, and the great, bodies of Protestant Christians
which discuss feelingly the union under one sacra :
ment of all believers have felt that such a union
would be easier under Leo than any other.
Hi? position in European politics was that of an
arbiter, and it is now a pleasant memory that in his
last days he received the heads of two great Protes
tant empires, England and Germany, each in a way
the head of branches of the Christian faith, and that
he also had occasion to acknowledge the polite and
tasteful attentions of the President of the United
States, the greatest non-religious state that has ever
existed. Times have changed since the Pope was
both a spiritual and temporal successor to the Cae
sars, and Kings and Princes resorted to Rome, and in
the case of Henry IV even went to Canossa,, through
fear of the material power possessed by the head of
the church. Still Leo, by consent of mankind, by the
respect accorded his character and wisdom, probably
has influenced the modern world for good as much
as any. in the long line behind him influenced the
ancient world for the benefit of the men then living.
Still he seemed to feel hampered in Europe.
Whether the church and politics were too much
blended, by design or necessity, or whether he felt
that worldly ambitions were more potent than spir
itual real among his followers, he was never wholly
happy in his European realm. The great progress
of the anti-clericals in Italy, France and Spain, mak
ing a campaign that was keenly felt to be personal by
the gentle-minded Pontiff, was the cause of anxiety,
while the misfortunes that during his pontificate fell
upon the Hapsburgs, the last of the great Catholic
dynasties left among the royalties of Europe, were
to him in the nature of personal afflictions, for the
concordat will be between Austria and the Papacy
when it i< nowhere else.

cent of the amount of their capital. On this the Gov
ernment would place a tax of, say, 5* per cent per
annum. Because of this tax banks would call for the
additional currency only in times of stringency. That
is, interest on loans would have to be- higher than
5 per cent to induce a bank to go to the expense of
issuing additional currency. 4 As soon as interest
rates dropped: below -5 per cent* this currency would
be retired automatically. The success or failure of
the plan depends upon the fixing of the tax. Its ad
vocates who have made this a special study say that
5 per cent should be the rate. An issue of $200,000,
000 of additional currency would be possible under
the plan." . â¢ r^-
That wide differences of opinion exist among the
advocates of reform has long been apparent. Could
those differences Have been harmonized we should
have had the desired legislation at the last session,
for there can be no doubt that reform of some kind
was advocated by a majority in -both houses. It is
to be presumed that agreement on the disputed points
will be reached during the summer and that the. bill

spoke in part as follows: . '
My Dear Boys: A Breat Borrow, has fallen
on Christendom. Death has at â¢ last claimed
the man of raji.at whose bedside the entire
world haa kept vigil. Leo XIII lies cold in
death Â¦ In the Vatican. " and not one human

ficers: President, E. P. Flint; first vice
president, George W. Lewis; second? vice

J. H*ney; treasurer, Dr. F. E. Allen.'
Resolutions were adopted condemning
the United Republican League and es
pecially its members wflo are actively
working in Mayor Schmltz' behalf.
Speeches were made by many of the
prominent voters of the district, in which
they denounced the action of the United
Republican League and criticized very
forcibly certain of its members,' especial
ly those of the Forty-second District.
Active preparations will be made at
once by the members of this club to make
a strong showing at the coming primaries.
It is expected that the membership of
the club will soon reach 500 and the lead
ers are doing all in their power to defeat
the United Republican League in the
Forty-second. Another meeting is called
for next Tuesday night at the same hall.
BALLY m FORTY-SECOND.
The Thirty-seventh Assembly District
United Republican League held a meet
ing last night at 444 Devisadero street
W. J. Ruddick presided, and among the
speakers were Arthur G. Flsk. who
disclaimed any idea of nomination for
office. However, he was loudly cheered
when it was said by C. B. Perkins that
Fisk was the right man for Mayor of
San Francisco, and the speaker was
cheered again when he suggested that
Fisk be asked to allow himself to be
nominated for the position. Other
speakers were Senator Bauer, General
E. S. Salomon, W. J. Waldheimer, Judge
Bahrs, Dr. W. L. Williamson, C. O. Bur
ton Solomon , Bloom, Dr. C. D. Sal field
and Major H. T. Sime. The club will
meet every Tuesday evening at the same
address.
Would Nominate Fisk for Mayor.
The drums were muffled. The band
played Chopin's funeral march at the be
ginning of the mass and later the "Holy
Thirty-flrst Assembly District held a
meeting last night at its quarters 867
Bryant street, at which the following of
ficers were elected: President, D. H. Nor
ton; vice president, James Lucy; secre
tary and treasurer, William Henry.
Speeches were made by /Morris Flynn, W.
Henry and D. H. Norton. One hundred
and sixty members signed the roll of the

At 10 o'clock the regiment formed a hol
low square facing the simple altar erect
ed at tbÂ« base of the tall flagpole. The
Stars and stripes and the regimental col
ors drooped above. Father O'Ryan, spir
itual director of the League of trie Cross,
was celebrant. He was assisted by Fath
er Raggio and Father Foote of Santa
Clara. Hospital Stewards Solen and
O'Dea. the acolytes, wore khaki uniforms
in place of the cassocks usually worn in

HEADQUARTERS BAN FRAN
CISCO CALL, CAMP KEN
NEDY. SANTA CLARA, July
21.â Camp lost its joyous .aspect
for a while this morning. A*feel
ing of gloom spread over the cadets be
cause of the death of the Pontiff. Flags
flew at half mast. The band played dirges
in preparation for the solemn military
mass.
The selection of the nominee for Mayor
should be made by the convention and
not bv a coterie of politicians or the po
litical bureau of a corporation. The de
feat of Asa R. Wells, Republican nominee
for Mayor in the campaign two years
ago, was simply due to the fact that the
delegates were elected on a programme
to take orders* and the order to nominate
not only Wells but every other candidate
on the entire ticket was given in writing
to the chairman of every district delega
tion in the convention. At least 8000 Re
publicans resented the intrusion. Several
thousand voted for either Tobin or
Bchmitz, while others did not vote at all.
It is hardly conceivable that the Republi
cans will permit a repetition of such folly.
Delegate tickets must be filed in the
Registrar's office by July 31. The duty is
now up to the Republicans in the various
districts to put forward the best men of
the community for service in the nomi
nating convention.
The organization committee of the
Democratic County Committee has select
ed J. L. Romer as temporary chairman
and D. J. O'Xell as temporary secretary
of the Regular Democratic Club to be
organized In the Forty-first Assembly
District.
The Democratic League Club of the
Thirty-eighth Assembly District met
Monday night at Powers' Hall, Turk and
Pierce streets. The meeting was very
largely attended. Permanent organiza
tion was effected by the selection of the
following officers: James D. Mulcahy,
chairman; Clarence D. Clough, secretary;
J. E. Vorn. treasurer; Frank Dunn, vice
president; Frank Zacharlas, financial sec
retary; J- B. Kennedy, sergeant at arms.
The two factions of the Democratic
party of San Francisco now organizing
clubs in the several Assembly districts
and making ready for the battle at the
primary electiqn on August 11 have prac
tically agreed to elect delegates who will
nominate Franklin K. Lane for Mayor.
It is also regarded as certain that the
Democrats will renomlnate' Washington
Dodge for Assessor. The regulars and the
horse and carters will find other spoils to
contend for along the line of the munic
ipal ticket. No doubt efforts will be made
to induce the Harders-Ber&er faction of
the Union Labor party to indorse Lane's
candidacy for Mayor.
Republicans are taking note of the ac
tivity in the Democratic camp and are
not overlooking the political Incident that
Lane carried San Francisco In the last
gubernatorial election by 10,000 majority.
The Republicans, however, are well or
ganized. Ther/e has been a very large
enrollment of voters under the auspices
of the United Republican League, but in
the Twenty-eighth, Thirty-eighth, Thirty
ninth, Fortieth and Forty-first Assembly
districts the league forces will encounter
resistance at the primary election for del
egates to the convention. The wisest Re
publicans â the men who perceive the
strength of the Democratic organization
hold that all the elements of the party
should be brought together in support of
the Republican nominee for Mayor.
The party's candidate for Mayor should
be a well known citizen of sterling char
acter and tested ability. There ought
not to be any pledging of delegations in
advance of the convention. The surest
method of achieving Republican success
at the election next November is to
create a convention of citizens who are
deeply concerned In the welfare and pro
gress of the city and who are not depend
ent on politics for a livelihood. Repre
sentative men of each district who con
tribute to the maintenance of the local
Government by the payment of taxes
ehould be placed on the district tickets
to be voted for as delegates to the Re
publican nominating convention.
Both Democratic Fac
tions Agree to Sup
port Ilane.

The boy was taken to police headquar
ters and after l>elng told of his narrow
escape from the crimps, he promised that
he would not attempt to run away from
home again. His father left for home
with his so:^by the first train, as he said
he was afRld the boy might be kid
naped. â¢ '-?}'Â£
The boy was walking past Hansen's
place after he reached the city and a man
accosted him and induced him to enter.
He was kept there, practically a prisoner,
until rescued.
Elder at once started for this city, ar
riving yesterday morning, and hurried to
police headfiuarters. Detective Coleman
was sent with him to 17 Vallejo street
and Coleman says when Hansen was
asked if such a boy was there he denied
It. The boy was seen to hurriedly leave
by th^ rear door, followed by a man, and
when Elder declared that there was
ecmething wrong a man whispered to him
that the boy was afraid of being arrested
in connection with a bicycle he had
bought before leaving home. The boy had
been taken round the block and put in a
rear room, where Detective Coleman and
hie father found him.
Through the assistance of tlje police, \V.
B. Elder, a farmer from Selma, rescued
his eon, Cleve Elder, 16 years of age,
from the hands of crimps yesterday morn
ing. The crimps had arranged for the
usual blood money to send him to sea on
a deep-water vessel.
The boy. who is entirely ignorant of the
ways of the world, ran away from his
home on July 12. His parents did not
hear anything about him till Monday,
when his mother received a letter from
him asking her to send him the photo
graph of his sister and a few personal ar
ticles as he had obtained a good job as
cook on a steamer which was to sail from
this port for Liverpool. England, on July
22. He wrote that he. had beeri promised
lots of money when he reached New
York, wh^re the vessel would touch, and
he would send it to his mother. The let
ter was dated from Harry Hansen's sail
ers' boarding-house at 17 Vallfjo street.

STAR PITCHER. TA1JLS
DEAD ON THE STREET
Ernest Nichols of Spokane Club Ex
pires Suddenly While- in Com
pany of Teammates.
SPOKANE, Wash.. July 21.â Ernest
Nichols, the star pitcher of the Paciflu
National Baseball League, died suddenly
at Natatorium Park last evening of heart
trouble. Nichols, apparently In good
health, had been talking and laughing
with other Spokane ball playera while
taking a plunge In the natatorium pool.
Later while waiting for a car, First Base
man Nordyke saw Nichols' head fall for
ward as if in a faint. His comrades
placed him on a bench, but could not re
vive him.
Nichols was a native of Nevada and but
21 j-ears old at the time of his death. Ho
first gained prominence as a pitcher for
the Reliance team in the midwinter
league last year. Hl3 ability was soon
recognized and he was siffned by the Spo
kane club. He has tjeen by long odds the
stellar slab artist of the Pacific National
league, having won 21 out of 23 games
this season, a record that has not been
equaled on this coast for a long time.
Nichols' remains will be brought to.thit
city, where hi3 relatives reside. He vJU
be buried here. The members of the lUQl
ance team will act as pallbearers.
SHAMROCK III IN FORM.
With Her Owner on Board She Makes
Great Showing.
ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS. N. J.. July
2i._ After her narrow margin of victory
yesterday, Sir Thomas Lipton's new chal
lenger for the nautical blue ribbon was
again in racing form to-day and trimmed
her trial horse by 33 minutes 17 seconds
in a twenty mile race. Much of her vic
tory was due to a fluke in which she cov
ered miles of water, while Shamrock I
hung idle in a calm. Another thing which
the sailors say brought luck to the new
boat was that Sir Thomas, after watch
ing the race from the Erin for several
days, sailed to-day on the challenger.
Her crew declares he rarely fails to bring
good luck.
The race, was to have been for forty
miles, but a shift of wind spoiled the
plan and the boats sailed a close reach
east-southeast from Scotland ship and
back, the last five miles about dead to
windward. Shamrock I was just passing
Sandy Hook lightship four miles away
when the challenger rounded Scotland
lightship and finished.
The boats then took a broad reach aÂ£
six miles south along the Jersey coast
in a 10-knot wind. Shamrock III ran
away from the- old boat at about an
eighth of a mile on the way out. beating
her by a few hundred yards back to the
lightship. She clinched her victory by
outsailing her by several minutes in a
thresh-up through Gedney's channel and
the ship channel to their moorings in the
horseshoe. The victory was decisive on
every point of sailing.
There are 19S Baptist churches in Rus
sia, with 22,244 members, and last year
1254 were added by baptism.

Matinee Races at Tanforan
on Admission Day.
The members of Golden Gate Park
Driving Association met last night in the
Palace Hotel and outlined plans for a
programme of matinee races at Tanforan
track on Admission day.
Instead of throwing the races open, as
in the past, it is proposed to have a pro
gramme of four invitation races in which
the horses will be carefully matched. The
races will be for cups and ribbons. One
artistic cup has been offered already for
competition in a special race.
President Edward Aigeltinger will ap
point committees to take charge of the
affair at the next meeting- of the club*.
Speedway Horses Will Take Part in
DRIVING ASSOCIATION
MEET FOB SEPTEMBER
McChesney will be pent to Saratoga to
morrow under the care of Frank Taylor.
The nature of McChesney'n injury is* not
positively known. It might bp cured in a
week or it might take a month. There is
no chance of the Western horse taking:
part in any race within the next ten
days, hence the proposal of the Metropol
itan Jockey Club to offer $10,000 for Mc-
Chesney and Waterboy to meet at Jamaica
could not be entertained, although both
Messrs. P. J. Dazc-1 and P. II. McCarren
said they were willing to make such an
offer on behalf of the racing- association.
The first race at Saratoga for which
both McChesney and Waterboy are eligi
ble is the Saratoga Champion stakes, to
be run on August 15. Both horses are
entered for the Saratoga Cup, to be run
on August 22, and the Champlaln stakes,
August 25. It is understQod Waterboy
will be shipped to Saratoga within ten
days.
NEW YORK, July 21.â There will be no
match race at Brighton Beach to-mcrrow
between Waterboy and McChesney. The
latter pulled up lame after h:s jrallop to
day at Gravesend track. He injured his
off foreleg. In the workout the first mile
was done in 1:42, with a last quarter in
:2S. The lameness was so pronounced that
the special waa abandoned. Word was at
once conveyed to John Boden Jr., secre
tary of the Brighton Beach Racine Asso
ciation, and h<Â», with murh regret, posted
a bulletin announcing the special could
not be run.

UP THEIR ATTENTION"
To the President and Members cf the Jour
neymen Stonecutters' Association â Gentlemen:
Since misrepresentations of the matter at issue
between uÂ« have appeared In the press lately,
we deem It but Justice to ourselves that we
should put the facts before the public in their
true light
First â We have offered to arbitrate our dif
ferences arbitrators to be chosen in the usual
way. which offer naa been absolutely refused
by you. *
Second â We have also proposed that we
would put members of the Stonecutters' Union
on the planere at such periods aÂ» would not
destroy the efficiency of our planers during
completion of present contracts, taken long
before you made these demands, you well
knowing that they are necessary to success
fully carry on our business, and keep our
agreements. We even agreed In the Interest
of peace that your members should be paid
the asual rate of stonecutters' wages during
apprenticeship, and that only the regular
union hours should be worked, stipulating only
that our present skilled planer hands be al
lowed to work a second Â«mft till our present
contracts are completed.
This last proposition was practically adopted
at a general meeting of your union by a good
majority. Without further discussion or vote
It was rescinded the following day. We have
the Interest of the trade at heart and Â»tand
ready to make any arrangement that will not
be unjust to our present employes, your union
or ourselves and we should have sufficient
business sense and mutual forbearance to ar
rive at this result.
We must emphatically deny that the men
now employed upon our, planers are unskilled,
some of them having worked with us for nine
years and a majority of them for over tnree
years! while the members of your union at
present here are absolutely unskilled In the
use of these machines.
We have sent this statement to the press as
the true facts in the case and stand ready to

Clark represents the contracting firm
that laid the cable and Barwell is the
chief electrician for the cable company.
Pendar is the grandson of the famous
father of cables. Sir John Pendar. who
backed Cyrus Field in the first cable en
terprise, and A. E. Wolf Barry is the son
of Sir John Wolf Barry, who constructed
the Tower bridge of London. The two
last named gentlemen simply accompa
nied Captain Pattlsorr as his. guests on
his tour of the world by the Suez Canal.
Captain Pattison stated last evening
that, while the cable had been connected
on July 4, the contract work would not bÂ«
accepted by the cable company until Au
gust 4. by which time the contractors will
have made their guaranty tests. He also
added that it would probably be sixty
days before the cable would be opened
for general use by the public, for it would
require that time to complete the cable*
buildings at the various stations and per
fect the connections at the Manila end.

These visits go to show the man had
some object In being in that neighbor
hood, though what it was is a question.
And after all his wanderings have been
traced the whole thing resolves itself
down to one puzzling Question, "What
was the man doing In West Berkeley and
why did he linger about In the neighbor
hood of the Brennan barn at 7 o'clock?"
when he was seen by Mrs. Annie Wilson.
Three men who thought the man was
one who had applied to them for work
and assistance looked at the body to-day,
but went away satisfied that he was not
the man they knew. D. W. Standeford of
Eighth - and Market streets, Oakland,
thought the deceased might have been a
man named Allnut, who came to him
looking for work with a recommendation
from Professor F. H. E. O'Donnell of the
State Deaf and Dumb and Blind Asylum.
When Standeford looked at the body he
was unable to say that It was that of the
same man, and later Professor O'Donnell
visited the Morgue and said he was posi
tive it was not the man to. whom he had
given a letter. Peter Johnson of b73 Thir
teenth street thought it was a man to
whom he had loaned a dollar on the
strength of a story of hard luck, but
when he examined the man's features he
said it was a different person altogether.
Charles A. Brown, a horseman known
as "Pe'digtee'-\Brown, thinks he saw the
unidentified stranger at the Sausalito
poolrooms last Wednesday. Among the
effects 'in the murdered man's pockets
was a return ticket to Sausalito.
LINGERED AT BARN.
All this conversation took place about five
minutes before 11 o'clock. I drove around trÂ»
three, or four places, delivering orders, and
finally reached Carman's saloon Just as the
whistle was blowing at the noon hour. As I
drove toward the saloon on San Pablo avenue
I saw thla man come out and start toward the
barn, where he was afterward killed. That
was the last I law of him. '
The stranger paid two visits to West
Berkeley In the course of day, and
what he was doing there is a mystery.
Erickson, of course, saw him on the first
visit and Mrs. E. R. Burcher, F. A. Con
nor and Frank Deach saw him on the
second. The second visit was made about
3 o'clock. The old man went into Con
nor's Blue Front saloon about that time
and asked the way to the Burcher house,
which is in the neighborhood. He asked
one auestlon there: "Does Burcher still
run this place?" Upon being told that
Burcher hau quit the business he went
out, going 'â¢! the direction of Burcher's
house. Connor and Deach were in the
place playing cards at the time and they
remember 1 ii'" man well.
Soon after leaving the saloon the man
met Mrs. Burcher and her daughter in
the front yard of their home. Of them he
asked the way to the road. Upon being
shown the way by Mrs. Burcher he
started oft toward the road, Mrs. Burcher
and Miss Burcher following a little dis
tance behind. At the end of the block
i..e man stopped, and allowing the women
to catch' up to him asked If ..e might have
a glass of water. Miss Burcher went
back and got him a glass of water and
then he went -â At no time did he ask
of them anything about Mr. Burcher, and
Burcher himself says he never heard of
or saw the man In his life.
â¢ I don't remember from Juat what direction
he came, whether from the east or the went.
When I first looked at him I concluded that
he must be a collector for some San Francisco
firm But I noticed he didn't go as If he had to
Ket anywhere in a hurry or for any good rea
son. Â¦ â . ,
As soon as he saw me he changed his
course and came toward me. When he reached
the wagon he said, "Are you going to Point
Illchmond to-day?" I said. "No; we keep *
wagon over there all the time now and I don t
BO there any more."
After a pause for a moment or two he Â«ala,
"Well, can you change a five-dollar piece for
me*" I said, "Of course; I've always got a lot
of silver on hand." I pulled my purse out of
my hlD uocket. unrolled it and counted out
five silver dollars. In the meantime he had
taken his purs* out of his pocket and taken out
a five-dollar gold piece. As he did this I could
hear Â«ome money rattle. I didn't pay much
attention to what he had, but when I leaned
over to hand the silver to him I saw several
gold and silver piects In the purse. There was
considerable money In it.
Well, after he had fixed the thing up, I said.
"Do you want to take a ride up to the ave
nue?" He Â«aid. "No; I've got plenty of time.
I guess I'll walk."
The last thing I said to him was, "Will you
have a glass of beer?" He said, "No, thank
you, I don't care for any." Then I drove off.
That was the first time a man on the road ever
refused to take a drink from me. I meet lots
of men on the road and some of them are bold
enough to ask for a drink, but thla one did
not." I thought he must be a superior kind of
man.
GOLD PIECES IN PURSE.
' I was at Malcolm's when I first saw the
man. He was dressed in the same way as the
other people -described him. with an overcoat
on his arm and a cap on his head. I didn t
notice his other clothes particularly.
Erickson was making his usual rounds
"of the West Berkeley district with an En
terprise bottling wagon last Friday and
remembc j the stranger well. He met
him in two different /places within an
hour. The first time was at Â¦ Malcolm's
grocery, near Corbln station on the South
ern Pacltlc Railroad: the second time at
Carman's, saloon on the. San Pablo road.
Erickson said;
The. man who saw the stranger with
money is George Erickson, a driver for
the Enterprise Brewery Company, who
lives at 417 San Pablo avenue, Oakland.
Krlckson is positive the old man had a
purse with considerable money in it, for
he changed a $3 gold piece at his request,
and during this transaction the open
purse revealed a number of gold and sil
ver pieces. This discovery shows that the
man was not poverty stricken and de-
Bpondent. as has been supposed all along,
and It disposes altogether of the suicide
theory.
That the man found dead near the Bren
nan barn on San Pablo avenue with two
bullet holes in his head and his skull frac
tured was murdered there is now not the
least doubt, for the searchers after clews
discovered a man to-day who had seen
him with a purse full of money on the day
of his death, and having money the man
must have been murdered for It, for he
had not a cent in his pockets when his
lifeless body was found.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, July 21.
Miles is 21 years old. in comfortable cir
cumstances and the couplers relations had
been of the happiest.
Miles was crazed by the accident. Ha
rushed Into the street like a madman and
then back into the house, being followed
by passers by. A close watch was put on
him to prevent him taking his own life.
COLVILLE. Wash., July 21.â James A.
Miles, a young man who recently married
a girl of IS, this morning shot his wife
through the heart and she died the next
moment with her arms clinging about his*
neck. The shooting appeara to have been
purely accidental.
Miles was about to start on a fishing
trip and had taken out his hammerlesa re
volver to carry with him. He says ha
was leaning over hl.s wife's chair, talking
to her, and must have pressed the trigger
unconsciously, for there was a sudden re
port and the next Instant she was clinging
to him. He did not know she was shot
until he saw the blood trickling from her
bosom. By the time he had carried her to
the bed*she was dead.
When the dog died Mrs. Vogel called
in a Park-street plumber who laid out
the deceased animal, measured it and
made a zinc coffin into which he placed
the body and hermetically sealed the cas-
Het. This Mrs. Vogel has constantly kept
by her and whenever she moves from one
house to another, as she has done in this
city, "Trixle's" ejicofflned remains are
gently handled.
ALAMEDA, July 21.â With a little me
tallic coffin Inclosing the embalmed re
mains of her pet dog "Trixie," Mrs. A. N.
Vogel has left here to Join her husband,
the director general of Alameda'3 last
spring carnival, who is now at Eureka,
Humboldt County, "Trlxle" ceased to
bark nearly a year, ago as a result of be
ing run over by her mistress* buggy. The
body of the dead canine has been treas
ured ever since by Mrs. Vogel, who is a
strong believer in the reincarnation of the
souls of animals. She often explained to
friend3 that she expected the spirit of
the departed dog to return to please her
as a sweet warbling canary instead of a
cheerful canine with a merry bow wow
and a glad tail. Although "Trixie" has
up to date failed to come back to earth
in any form, Mrs. Vogel asserts that she
believes the reincarnation of her late pet
will soon be consummated.

erty consist* of the land and ten flats
on the corner of Tenth and Folsom
streets valued at more than $50,000; prop

Blnnegan climbed down the Alarm-da's ladder
yesterday on Ma way to Angel Island, to the
quarantine section of which he is consigned
for his sins, it was a ead barber, pale, un

still throbbing the echoes of that "good time."
Before full explanations could be made the
effects of the Honolulu "good time" manifested
themselves In the Ehape of delirium tremens

"Don't wanner eo t* Alameda. Take me

"Wherethelami?" was the next sign of

How did you get here? Who are you? Where's
your ticket?"

when that officer tried to arouse the unknown
and unaccounted for passenger.
Oustave Binnegan. barber, arrived yester
day from Honolulu on the liner Alameda. HlÂ«
name does not appear on tbe passenger list.
As a matter of fact, until the A'.ameda was
well at sea neither the ship's officers nor
Blnnegan himself knew that he was on board.
Ulnnegan has lived In Honolulu long enough
to learn the effect of every variety of strong
water, but a few days b'fore the Alameda
railed. In the effort to have an extra good
time, he overreached his powers of assimila

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
BERKELEY, July 21.â The inter
esting news comes from Manila
that George W. Beattle. a grad
uate of the University of Call-
Wells was born In Louisiana 65 years
ago of rich parents. He early began the
study, of sculpture, under the tutorship
of the best instructors of the time. He
achieved fame abroad, and several years
ago took up his residence in this city.
The deceased was a sculptor of great
talent and his work attracted attention
wherever It wns exhibited. He lived in
lavish style until his funds began to grow
low. A short time ago he was forced to
apply for admission to the City and
County Hospital, as he was unable to pro
vide for himself longer.
Wells was one of the charter members
of the Bohemian Club. He leaves a wife
and two young sons to mourn his loss.
Francis Marion Wells, the noted sculp
tor, writer and former clubman, died at
the City and County Hospital shortly aft
er 2 o'clock this morning. Wells had been
confined in the hospital for several weeks,
suffering from general breakdown of the
system, and his death was not altogether
unexpected by his family and his few re
maining friends.
lod > where the Rlzal Institute,/ presided
ove'r by another University of California
man, Ray Howell, 1900, is doing excellent
work. It has been a great factor in the
education of the young people of the
higher classes.
The Normal School at Manila, of which
Mr. Beattle will now have charge, is de
signed to preoare native teachers for
work in the schools. Mr. Seattle has
great faith in the future of the Filipino
teachers and he believes the province of
the American teacher is to prepare them.
He finds they are very ambitious and
anxious to please. In dealing with them,
however, he has found them somewhat
timid, especially the women, and his ex
periences have heen varied. At. one time
a teachers' convention was called, but
the women feared to travel far without
escorts. This difficulty was overcome only
when he hired a steamer and went about
the coast collecting the teachers, who
were satisfied when they found his wife
on board ready to chaperone them. *
Mr. Beattle graduated from the univer
sity in 1899 and received his master's de
gree In 1901. Before entering the univer
sity he had been County Superintendent

ITS ANNUAL MEETING
Thj. China Commercial Company"*! steamship
Lothian arrived yesterday from the Orient by
Â«ay of Manzanltlo and Guftyrr.as. Her com
mander. Captain Williamson, is well known
here, having been last In this port as captain
or the army transport Lennox when that ves
sel was towed In disabled through the Golden
Oate by the fteam schooner Iaqua. The Ix>

ber of Chinese to Manzanillo. I.Ike the Chlng
vl o. she was detained In quarantine, and as
In the Chlnir Wo's case, the Ixithian's passen
rers resented the detention. Unlike the Chin*
Wo"* eklpi>er. however. Captain Williamson did
not take refuge on the vessel'* bridge, did not
arm hi* Bailor* and waiter?, neither did he
mount the steam hose nor call on the Mexican
military authorities for Â»R5lstance. With a
few well directed Anglo-Saxon expletives he
tav* the Chinese to understand that he was
captain of the ehlp and that he wished and
would have jx-ace on board. And lie got It.
Captain Williamson thinks, however, that the
strict Quarantine enforced against the ships of
his line Is the work of the company's com
petitors. The Mexican authorities have been
etlrrcd up. he says, against the immigration
they once favored and some direct Influence
is at work to make matters as unpleasant as
possible for the Pacific Mall Company's com
petitor. The Lothian had .'Â»9S Chines'*, of
whom 273 were landed at Manzaniilo. They
had a clean bill of health and no sickness dur
ing a voyage of thirty days. There was one
death which the quarantine officials who saw
the body dlacnosrd as heart failure. For all
this, however, the Lothian was held in quar
antine thirteen days. Every passenger was
inoculated with plague serum and thÂ£ vessel
was fumigated five times. And during the
period of detention the quarantine official!) en
tertained their. shore friends lavishly as the
vessel's commissary would afford in the Lo
thian's cabin.

were chronic and incurable came out
cured, happy, and in perfect health

Back to the Country.
A young woman of Bradford. Vc. made
her way to a good position In a big Bos-
ton etore and gave It up because of sick-
ness at home, but it all came out right
at last and 6he tells the story this way:
"Two years ago I had to leave a position
as bookkeeper in a Boston department
6tore to go back home to take charge
of the old place, as mother's health seem-
ed chattered, and what do you suppose
proved to be the cause that forced me to
return?
"I found her very weak, unable to sit
up all day and with a dizzy feeling jf
she tried to move about. She had been
advised to stop coffee drinking, but as
she had used It from childhood It seemed
as though nothing could take its place.
I had settled down to etay at the farm
when one day I got to thinking over the
situation and concluded to try an experi-
ment. I got a package of Postum Coffee.
It W2S not cooked right the next morning-
and we were all disappointed. That was
because we had tried to make it like cof-
fee. Next morning I had Postum made
according to directions and we were all
delighted. In a few days you should
have seen the change in mother. Since
that time we have never drank coffee and
now we all drink Postum twice a day
and Bometlmes three times and think It
superior to coffee.
â¢â¢The change in mother's health since
ehe quit coffee and took up Postum has
been wonderful. She Is once more able
to take the work again, quite well In fact,
with no more weakness and nervousness,
no more *our stomach, no more trouble
of any kind. To cut a long story short she
is now entirely welt and I am going back
to Boston in a few weeks, thanks to
Poetum." Name given by Postum Co.,

return to the harbor.
The yacht* left Newport harbor about
ID o'clock this morning in a northwesterly
breese. Within fifteen minutes after the

SANTA BARBARA, July 21.â Never be
fore in the history of polo events in this
city has there been a larger or more
representative gathering of society than
that which attended the game here to
day between the Burlincame and Santa
Barbara teams in a contest for the mid
summer tournament cup. The field was
in excellent condition and the players at
the best. The Santa Barbara team won
by a score of 5 to 2, although the result
of* the game was in doubt until the last
period. The game was characterized by
several long and spectacular runs, and
honors were divided until the 'end. The
line-up of the teams was as follows:
Burlingameâ C. W. Clark, F. J. Caro
lan.. TJ A. Driscoll and F. D. Hudson,
The latter Is from Kiverslde, and was
called in to fill the team for the first con
test . ,- <:
The close ties of relationship that bind
the Bates and Cutter families naturally
intensifies their mutual grief and anxiety
over the -unfortunate affair. In speaking
of the accident last evening Mr. Bates
said that his own grief over the condi
tion of his only boy was almost inconso
lable. He, however, readily appreciated
that the shooting was purely an accident
and he keenly felt for the Cutters in their
sorrowfdr realization that their" own son
had been the unfortunate cause of the
mishap. .
Hovering between life and death, with
a; frightful gunshot wound in his abdo
men, the result of the playful handling
of a dangerous weapon, Dudley C. Bates,
the seven-year-old and only son of Frank
D. Bates, the well known Â» Front-street
merchant, lies on a cot in the Lane Hos
pital.
Mr. and Mrs. Bates and their eon up
to Friday last were. enjoying an outing
in Mill Valley and residing at the Blythe
dale Hotel. E. B. Cutter of the firm of
Cutter & Mosely cf this city is also liv
ing in the valley, where his young son.
about the aze of Dudley Bates, found
an enjoyable companionship in the last
named boy, who happens to be his cousin.
Friday afternoon the little fellows were
playing happily together, when a third
boy, named Murphy, appeared on the
scene with a gun. â¢ The weapon event
ually fell into the hands of young Charles
Cutter, who. while playing with it, acci
dentally pulled the trigger. There was a
loud repopt and before Cutter had re
covered from his fright resulting from
the explosion of the gun his cousin was
lying upon the ground, writhing in the
agony of a terrible wound in the abdo
men.
Assistance was immediately summoned
and a hurried examination eff young
Bates showed that he was badly wounded
and with all possible haste % the unfortu
nate little fellow was brought over to
this side of the bay and conveyed to the
Lane Hospital. Later In the day an ope
ration was performed by Drs. Rixford
and Stillman, It havinc been developed
that the- boy's intestines had been per
forated Jn four places. Although still in
a critical condition, the surgeons hold
out hope for the recovery of their youth
ful patient, he having showed some signs
of improvement during the last twenty
four hours.
According to George Von Of en the af
fections of Josephine Von Ofen, his wife,
are mercurial. In a complaint for divorce
filed by him yesterday he alleges that
she regulates them by his salary. He says
that when he earns $150 a month she has
the deepest regard for him, â¢ but that
when he comes home on the first of the
month with only $65 or $70 she has no' use
for him and tells him 80. Because of the
misery this fluctuation in his wife's af
fections causes him he wants a divorce.
He also asks the court to restore to him
a $5000 residence on Lyon street which
he says he deeded to her in March,- 1892.
and which she subsequently had declared
a homestead. .The Von Ofens were mar
ried April 3, 1878. â¢
Isadore Less, who sought the office of
City Treasurer on the Labor ticket at the
last election, was sued for divorce by
Annie E. Less. She charges him with
cruelty and says that for many months
past he has been in the habit of threat,
ening to take her life and has on several
occasions cruelly beaten her. They were
married May 23, 1891, and have four child
ren. Mrs. Less asks for a divorce and
for $20 a month alimony.
Suit3 for divorce were also filed by An
nie Connolly against James Connolly for
neglect; Clinton E. Hobbs against Alice
Hobbs for desertion and James Bronnell
against Sarah Bronnell for desertion.
Chester F. Wright, the corset manufac
turer, who is being sued for divorce by
Tahoe D. Wright, filed an answer to her
complaint* yesterday. He denies that he
has treated her In a cruel and Inhuman
manner or has ever beaten her as she
charges in her complaint.
Judge Murasky granted Interlocutory
decrees of divorce to H. J. Mahler from
Evelena Mahler for failure to provide
and David W. Critchlow from Alice
Critchlow for desertion.

Receipts of most descriptions of fruits were
light but ample, and choice stock moved off
well. Fruit Is maturing slowly, owing to the
cocl. cloudy weather, and the receipt* of ripe

quotation*. The river boats brought light car
goes, and basket lots cleared up readily at good
prices. No- 2 Bartlett Pears were dull, al

" Butter Is more or leas unsettled, with wide

Two house* yesterday sent out cards offering
their best 'creameries at' 25c. Stccks are not
large, but the demand Is poor.
The advance In Cheese is hax-ing: the effect
of checking the demand, and some houses who
quoted 131-.C for flat* on Monday dropped back
to 13c yesterday. The market is very unset

price. Prices are likely to be uncertain until
conditions become settled again.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
I rario an.l Southern issues. Lake Erie and West
| ern preferred, Brooklyn Ra; M Transit. Metro
; politan Street Railway, Pacific Coast and Peo
ria .and Kaetern.
There was the usual large crop of rumors,
I but nothing definite could be learned. At seme
i of the banks which have close Wall street cun
j nectior.s it was Â«ald that a number of loaui>
I ha<l been called.
Much of to-day's selling was for out of town
j account. The West was again a very heavy
seller; the gossips declared that a prominent
St. Loots Interest had been forced to sell out A
line of 4U.CUU sliar*s.
The day v.-as not without some news of a fa
vorable character. The quarterly report for
the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company showed
I surplus increases of over $500,000, with an In-
I create of almost $OOO.WO for the half year. In
. *-pit- of this, the stock was among the. weakest
I In the list.
The steady decline In the Steel stocks created
I great uneasiness.

and 414 for the preferred. In the May 9 panic
of 1901 the common sold at 24 and the pre
ferred at C9. To-day's drop was in the face
of open buying by banking interests which con
ducted the corporation's syndicate transactions.
The financial authorities of the corporation de
clined to be officially quoted as to the truth of
the rumors. that the next dividend on the com
mon was to be paeeed. The usual rumors cir
culated also that the urgent liquidation was due
to .financial embarrassment by this or the other
Important capitalist. But the market seemed
to take these rumars with a good deal of equa
nimity and there was a considerable absorption
of standard railroad stocks, so that* price* In
many instances rose at one time a point or more
over last night. New York Central was in no
table demand. There was a demand for this
stock also in the loan crowd on the exchange,
which caused an Impression that a considerable
chert interest had been built up In the stock.
The thorts were an elemant In the~buylng at
other pcints. There was little . In the day's
new* to explain the action of the market. The
Weather Bureau's weekly crop bulletin was
considered less than reassuring as to the spring
wheat situation, and the action of the whole
market confirmed this impression. The only
notable effect In the securities market was a
sharp decline In the Burlington joint 4s. Great
Northern preferred, however, jumped six points
In the face of the general movement of the
market. Denial* were forthcoming of some of
the recent rumors of annual borrowings by rail
road corporation*, but the possibility began to
be canvase?d that Improvements would be cut
off. except where necessary to be carried out
because already entered on. rather than venture
ijt temporary loans In the present stringency of
tTie money market. News of railroad earnings
were favorable, the Louisville and Nashville
Â¦<n>1 the Illinois Central making guxl returns of
net earnings for June.
There were weak spot* In the bond market,
but the market as a whole was irregular. To
tal sales (par value). S2.377.0CO.
United States bonds were unchanged on Iasl
call.
Bear attack*, coupled with further forced
liquidation, resulted in a new low level for a
numbrr of securities in to-day's stock mar
ket. Declines ranged from 15 points to 3.
while inmc of the better grade stocks showed
losses of a point or more.
Hallway shares of the better class were mod
erately firm, but in little demand, and there
was no evidence of "bargain buying" In these
Issues. The attack on prices began at the
opening and wa* continued with more or lees
regularity throughout the day. In fact, lowest
prices for some ixsues came almost at the close.
The United States Steel shares were most
severely pounded, with net losses of 2% ani
:>> in the common Â»n1 preferred respectively.
Sales of these stocks aggregated over 1m!,Â»"hmi
shares, over 132. ouo shares cf common chang
ing hands. Trading In the Steel stocks com
prised considerably more than one-fifth of the
day's business. Steel common ctosed at 22. a
low record figure, while the preferred stock
touched 70.
Besides the Steel issues, the lowest prices
ever recorded were scored by Tennesssee Coal
and Iron. Colorado Fuel and Iron. Republic
Iron and Steel preferred. United States Realty
and Virginia-Carolina Cnemicei. In the rail

pears that the farmers were the gainers In this
business, for after holding out stubbornly for
some time they compelled the dealers to pay
their asking prices. Some dealers go â¢ > far
as to say that all the crop has been bought up.
while others, more conservative, doubt whether
half the crop has bÂ«en secured. But the fact
remains that the dealers have got at least the
lion's, chare of the Hay. and that no. lower

and before leaving that district, in 1895,
he had the satisfaction of seeing a third
church erected in the locality. He then
removed to "\Vailuku, r the central part of
the island, and while there his services
were â¢ also required at three other mis

Father T Llbert' remained . at Wailuku

Father Libert was appointed to the mis T

1882 he was stationed with the mission at
Kauai. and worked 1 diligently throughout
that northern part of the island. So sat

that he was transferred in 1833 to the
southen part of Kauai. He built chapels
In the northern districts, adding: to the
already established places of worship of

churches built through his instrumental

also added churches in the; southern part

suffered suffocation had not J. McBride
dragged them through the smoke to the
street below.
WOMAN IS UNCONSCIOUS.
One of the last women to be carried
unconscious from the building was Mrs.
L. Flynn, a janitress employed on the
sixth floor of the building. The moment
that she noticed the smoke she ran into
the hall rind was advised by one of the
firemen to bo ud to the roof until the
smoke cleared away from the stairs. She
accordingly went up on the roof and pa
tiently awaited to be rescued. In a short
time a flremairwent for her and she was
carrjed downstairs. The smoke was so
thick that shÂ« became unconscious and
it took Feveral minutes to recover when
she was eventually eafely landed on the
sidewalk.
By chopping through the roof of the
sidewalk vault the firemen finally got sev
eral streams of water turned on the
flames. By great effort a line of hose
was dragged up the twisted stairways
to the top floor, where the flre had made
its appearance after eating' its way up
the dust shaft. From this hose the build
ing received a damaging drenching before
the flre was nut out.
'Â¦' Although all of those renting offices In
the building, to the number 1 of about sev
enty-five. Â¦ were losers by smoke and wa
ter, the heaviest damage was confined to
the two lower stores facing on Mission
street. .-:'
The heaviest loser is the Standard Elec
tric Construction Company. This firm
had between $40,000 and $50,000 worth of
electric fixtures in the basement, which
are more or less damaged by water. They
have the contract for furnishing the Ho
tel Francis and the new Flood building
with electric . fixtures and they were
stored in the basement, awaiting the
completion of the buildings. These fix
tures are a total loss.
The Yawman & Erbe Manufacturing
Company has about $15,000 worth of office
fixtures and desks, which were stored in
the basement,, ruined by water. The firm
carries about $13,500 insurance, which Is
distributed with the following companies:
Commercial Fire Insurance Company,
German-American Insurance Company,
Continental Insurance Company of New-
York, Phoenix Insurance Company and
the Royal Insurance Company of Hart
ford, Conn.
The Wagner Bullock Electric Company
had $25,000 electric stock In the basement,
which was ruined. They carry between
$18,000 and $22,000 insurance.
H.W. Law, one of the owners of 'the
building, places the davage to the prop
erty at not more than $500.
According to J. M. Bowen, manager of
â¢the Yawman & Erbe Manufacturing. Com
pany, the flre was due to the carelessness
of some carpenters who were construct
ing a partition in the basement and left
the electric wires dangling with the in
sulatiqn rubbed off.
Accused of Forgery.
Henry Mohr, a grocer of 876 Mission
street, secured a warrant from Police

- When the smoke began pouring up the
elevator and waste paper shafts Dan
Flynn and Chris Brandhorst, the two
elevator boys, proved themselves heroes.
In .the murky blackness they continued
to run their elevators, taking excited pas
sengers from every floor until. after eight
or ten trips their machines caught flre
and had to be abandoned at the top floor.
By the time that the flre companies
arrived the. roof was lined with people
whose escape had been cut 'Off, and from
some. of the windows of the upper floors
vigorous- cries for help were being sent
down. The firemen could not get into
the building on the ground floor on ac
count of the smoke, but a ladder was
hoisted to the third floor and from that
several of them entered the building and
piloted the panic-stricken \ inmates to
safety.
With wet towels about their mouths,
the men and women from the offices be
gan to be led out into the street by flre-
A few minutes before 6 o'clock H. Chains ,
the night e'evator boy, while changing
his clothes in the basement, detected the
presence of a blaze in the cellar of Yaw
man & Erbe's establishment. He called
Night Watchman Leavitt and together
they tried to extinguish the flames with
a small hose, but to no purpose. Falling
in their efforts an alarm was turned in
from box 2S6 and later a second alarm
was .turned in.
The flre, which started in the basement
of the store of the Yawman & Erbe Man
ufacturing a Company, 635-639 Mlsslpn
street, was quickly communicated to a
large dust and waste paper shaft which
runs up the whole length of the elevator
shaft to the. top of the building. It was
from this that the smoke poured out into
every floor, making escape to those on
the upper stories impossible for the time
beinsr.
For half an hour yesterday afternoon
more than half a hundred people were
penned on the top floors of the Rlaltp
building:, corner of Mission \ and New
Montgomery streets, by volumes of chok
ing smoke arising from an incipient fire
in the basement. Before they could be
led 'to places of safety by the firemen
several women were overcome by the
dense fumes and were carried unconscious
down the smoke-filled staircase to the
safety of the street.
Without the slightest warning people
in offices more than a hundred feet from
the street were suddenly driven to their
windows and the roof by black clouds of
suffocating: smoke, which came from
some unknown source. To the *fear of
flre was added the element of panic and
it is little short of miraculous that many
people were not forgotten in the confu
sion and left to suffocate. ,
