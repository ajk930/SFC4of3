WASHINGTON. S<?pt. Mâ The presence
of Congressman Cannon In Washington
the past few days has elicited the infor
mation that Congressman John E.
K<?tchara of New York is to succeed Eu
gene F. Loud of California, as chairman
of the PostofSce Committee of the House.
This committee is expected to be one of
the most important during the next Con
gress as it will conduct the investigation
of postal scandals, which It Is generally
understood Congress will order.
Congressman Cannon's decision to ap
point Ketcham chairman is the result
of his friendship for George W. Smith of
Illinois. Ketcham does not want the
place. He realizes his inaDllity to fill it.
He Is 71 years old and ranking member
of the committee. Smith stands next to
Ketcham, but Cannon decided he could
not appoint him chairman because Illinois
already has its share of the chairman

lands ar.d the possibility of an outbreak
are attracting considerable attention.
There are already mutterings of discon
tent among the red men and a detail of
troops has been asked for from the Gov

The Indians are bitterly opposed to the
reservation being opened to the settle
ment of white men and frequent councils
of war are being held by the tribes.
Every effort is being made to appease
the red men, but it is feared that there
will be trouble when the opening occurs.
SALT LAKE. Utah, Sept !4.-Tbe ac

"on the Bide," In thÂ«Â« hope of being able
to locate good mines in the mineral belt
which runs through the large tract of
land. It is alleged that in the surveying

Gear of the First Circuit Court of the
Territory In a decision rendered by him In
the case of a Chinese accused, of selling

criminal laws are defective in that the
most trivial offenses, including drunken
ness, are legally classed with infamous
crimes, which require an indictment by a

curs with Judge Gear in. his decision. The
decision places the police in a serious di
lemma inasmuch as they cannot enforce
the most unimportant police regulation
without the aid of the Urand Jury.
The imperfections of the criminal laws
of the Territory are said to be due to the

Many of the universities In the East are
modeled on those abroad and are largely for
the sons of the favored few. Many of them
f oeter a feeling of sniffy superiority, a distrust
of popular rights, of popular education, of unli
versal suffrage, of most of the things that have
made this country great. Many of them de
velop a certain snobbish class distinction which
ought to have been forever forgotten when this
nation was founded.
They cannot encourage complete independ
ence because they are themselves dependent
on the endowments of a wealthy class and are
correspondingly hampered and restricted by
the timidity and prejudice of that class. - ,
This university is dependent only on the
State â that Is to eay, on the people.
Here . there is nothing to prevent anybody â
professor or student â from thinking if he is
capable of thinking, and thank God all of them
are capable of thinking and all of them exer
cise that blessed American privilege. , Â¦
This university offers the most perfect In
dependence, the fullest equality and the freest
opportunity. It does not invite the sons of any
special part of the community, but - stretches
forth Its arms - lovingly to the youth of Â¦ the
whole people. Here there is no distinction
save that of brains and industry. A university
such as this Is > a superior public school and
the crowning glory of our American public
school system. Truly -I am proud and happy
to ' be associated Â¦ with it as I have the honor

most highly; Mr. Howard is responsible for the
designing and construction of this beautiful
theater, and I wish to express my sincere ad

body said to lilmi ."Sonny, what . position do
you play on the nine?" And the small boy
said: "Ob, I don't play no position. I Just
belong."
I feel as if I Just belonged, but I am very
happy to belong and very proud to be asso
ciated in some way wltk this great university.
I believe that this university will eventually
be the greatest in the world because it is the
most thoroughly American. It is thoroughly
American and characteristically Californlan,
and no Institution can possess both of those
qualities and fail to reach the top.
Â¦ I Bay It is thoroughly American because I
believe that the essential elements of American
' progress and development are independence,

Jr., aged 24 years, was this afternoon
found guilty of murder in the second de
gree for killing Frank Rowe, a half-breed
Indian, at TVhltmore on December 29 last.
The verdict contained a recommendation
that the court in passing sentence impose*
the least penalty provided by law for
such a crime. That is ten years' impris
onment. Sentence will be passed Satur
day.
Rowe and Craven quarreled over 25
cents in a card game at Whitmore and
the killing resulted. Craven came to Red
ding and offered to give himself up. but
was not wanted, as the details of the
tragedy which first reached the District
Attorney showed Craven to have acted in
self-defense. The Coroner's inquisition re
sulted in Craven's arrest. In the mean
while he could have left the country had
he been so minded. The first trial, held

for acquittal and six for conviction for

ThÂ« university has long stood in sore need
of an auditorium ample enough for Its great
meetings and the celebration of Its chief fes
tivals. Once it has used a huge tent and
the winds sported with its roofing: and would
have none of It; once and again it tried the
gymnasium, and the roof sported with the
speaker's words till the wind bore them away;
twice at least for the university's annual fes
tival and repeatedly for others. It has trusted
Itself to the open California sky and not
having been deceived has learned ' that the
Greeks of the West must follow the Greeks

In building our theater on a site already
dedicated we follow an ancient and honorable
precedent. A hundred years before the old
Athenians niade the beginning of a perma
nent structure on the spot where now rest the
glorious ruins of their theater the people had
been used to assemble on the hillside over
looking the old orchestra, the dancing circle
at the southeastern foot of the acropolis, to see
the choral dance and hear the plays of Phrynl
chus and Aeschylus and ' Sophocles, of Crat
lnus, Eupolls and Aristophanes. As time went
on they built for the spectators seats of wood,
lkrta they called them. They were veritable
bleachers In the fact, and as bleachers often
do, these once at least collapsed and once
notably during an unusually interesting per
formance of a play of Aeschylusâ an occur
rence which set people a thinking: as well as
smarting and turned their thoughts' in the
absence of Portland cement toward seats of
stone. They built or tried to build at various
times, but not until the drama was well
toward the completion of Its second century of
residence in Athens did the good times of
Lycurgus bring the stable building which after
centuries of goodly use we now identify as
the Dionyslac Theater of Athens. That we in
these our earlier days can partake in the great
festival, can see openly, hear distinctly, and
sit securely we owe to the munificence of his
mother's son, William Randolph Hearst.
We dedicate to-day a new. structure on
Bround already consecrated. The well estab
lished usage of the graduating classes Ion;?
since appropriated this hillside to mystic rites
and set epart this spot to be a temenos". of
Dlonysos. These solemn trees that now look
down upon us have acquainted themselves well
through years of patient attendance with v all
the various ritual that makes up the service
of the sovereign god of dramatic art, and nÂ«re
they stand to-day Â¦ familiars to the romping
satyrs and the trooping maenads and guard
ians of the sacred revels. This day they shall
have Joy beyond their wont to see the worship
of the feast enacted by their old feathered
friends of the tribe of birds.

on the other hand, without a sincere and rea

lieve the Greeks worked with their antiquity),
before it was permitted to enter into the com

methods and of free design.

"THE BIRDS."
BAKER CITY, Ore.. Sept. 24.â Anderson
Garred, who shot and killed A. J. Mc-
Kinnon, former Sheriff of Harney Coun
ty, Oregon, at Guerneville, Cal., Septem
ber 8, was 'seen in this city to-day.
" Garred was arrested by Constable
Thornberg at Granite tha other day for
stealing a pair of shoes. The constable,
did not know he had arrested for petty
larceny a man wanted for murder, until
his attention was called to the fact by
a notice in a paper to that effect. He
went back to the jail to see that the pris
oner was more closely confined, only to
find that the man had escaped.
Thornberg is positive, since he saw the
picture sent out by Sheriff Grace of So
noma County, California, that the man
ha* had in jail was Garred, and this is
confirmed by several people who saw the
picture of Garred who declare that they
saw him on the streets of Baker yester
day and to-day. Officers are searching
for him to-night.

-i. Countless suggestions in the Interpretation of
natural 'conditions have been taken, obviously
from the works of classical-antiquity, but always
with an eye open. I hope, to, the dictates of our
American â our' California?*â civilization. This

' A filial ' gift to mother State from a eon

more Influential circles, this auditorium has
the added charm of being. In a Eense, a filial

Â¦A. Hearst, architectural plan. Sketch or fin
ished work. -jit has been our aim to keep it
.worthy, ol'idf. place in that supreme unit
A FILIAL GIFT.
And then we have essayed to come close to
nature, too, in the very lines and form of our
conception. We have taken our cue from the
oldtlme hollow in the hills which ' all men
.knew as Ben Weed's Amphitheater. And we
'have done as little as might be to change it.
bringing order out of its Irregularities, state
liness out of its suggested opportunities. If
Its proportions are useful and -agreeable let
the . praise be nature's. We have followed
where she led, as simply and as closely as
we could â wherein we have fallen short, call
the fault not hers.
As we are using it to-day, the theater is no
more ; than a sketch of what- we hope It will
one day becom*. We have beheld a vision which
In majesty and beauty shall In, the fullness of
time- rival the temples of old Greece. Is It to
remain a vision? . .''.'â¢'
â¢ If the building within which wo are gathered
fail of greatness otherwise, it has at least this
merit â that it is built firmly on good stuff.
Mother earth has no surer nor more enduring
foundation for work of man than these walls
rest upon. No more lasting elements hath she
than those of which this structure is made
up, for they aro of her very fabric This
building springs, racy of the soil, out of the
earth Itself ', of which it forms a part. In its
erection we have returned well nigh to the
primitive methods of prehistoric time and
built our bouse of mud. Ah! such mud pies
as we have played with here!
â¢ The - arts are- so many languages â various
means of communication betwixt a man and
bis fellows. But as all tongues are not equally
Intelligible It i Is perhaps not unseemly that
some sort of word-of-mouth commentary be
given on" what "is spoken here' In stone.
Not solely by the play of the imaginative
faculties can architecture achieve. It must
grow out of ' positive human needs and must
conform with - practical conditions. .. It is this
art'Â» peculiar privilege and its special diffi
culty that It must stand on. common-sense. It
it Is to rise, untotterihg, to greatness.
HOW THE ABTS SPEAK.
: -An architect feels that i when he has said
his say ln'-terms of his own art he has a right
to- -be., excused .from verbal' utterance. He
roaywdl-'paratihrase'the epitaph of Sir Chris
topher; Wren,, upon whose 'tomb we read "Si
Jmonumentum requiris. circumspice" ("If you
would, see his monument, look around."). &o
I might eay. -"Wauld -you have speech, hear
this architecture."
When President Wheeler saw the place for
the first time he was struck with the fact it
was a Greek theater in embryo. He called
Mrs. Hearst's attention to the possibilities of
the place and our dear lady gave to her son,
William Randolph Hearst, the suggestion
which he acted on and which has brought us
together so happily to-day. And, Mr. Presi
dent, âI cannot refuse myself the pleasure of
thanking Mr. Hearst and congratulating him
on the fine generosity with which he has
established in our midst this monument to
the genius of Greece, this silent witness that
we live in the lands of the gods.
f President Wheeler then read a letter,
Â¦Which -mr said -came -from a loyal gradu
ate of the university-rGovernor George
C. .'Pardee. .Cr/Pardee'said : he regretted

structure sta,nds. At the time it seemed that
it might have been formed by a land slide
many years before. It was shaded with trees
and was apparently what we wanted. Within
a few days Robert Mann, a classmate, visited
the place with me. We tested its acoustic
properties and found them excellent, and we
were sure that ever} body in- the audience
would be able to see. So we reported the
matter to the class and invited them to visit
the spot.
The iÂ»lay which we presented was a com
posite, many members of the class had a
hand in the making of it, but those who had
it more directly in charge were MaHa Oastle
houn, Jessica I'cixotto. Ed Wilder, Gt'.ctt Bur
jress, who was at that time an Instructor in
the university, and Frank Norrisâ dear Frank,
he ought to be here. The play was based on
the German Vehmgerichte, the secret courts
that flourished in Germany In the middle ages.
The framework cave an abundant opportunity
to present the incidents of our college life,
and initiate into our mysterious rites and priv
ileges the candidates from the class of '95.
In reviewing the?e events of nine years ago
the following points Â«em to me to stand out
Clearly in the light of to-day. The selection
of the amphitheater wa3 fortunate; but the
most fortunate, the happiest feature of all
was that rpoortunlty and inspiration were
given for the building of thls^Qreek theater.

though unauthorized, I started out to do so.

When President Wheeler, who happened
to be one of those persons in the latter
day habit, called the audience to atten
tion a little after 3 o'clock and those
"Tooters" turned their satire on him with
a mockery of one of his own phrases, "It
Is good to be here," the audience laughed.
13ut when President Wheeler returned the
compliment a moment laier by flinging
the phrase back at them the audience
laugher louder. Mr. Wheeler said;
"It indeed Is good to be here. It is good
to have you all here. It is good to have
the architect here. It is good to have the
discoverer here. And it is good to have
Â« the giver of this gift here. What could
be more fitting than that on this occa
sion the first speaker should be the first
-who strolled upon this hillside one day
and found this spotâ Ben Weed?"
Mr. Weed was graduated with the class
of '94 and he is a school teacher now
somewhere in the neighborhood of Santa
. Rosa. But when he left the university
he left an undying name, for the natural
' amphitheater he happened upon will al
ways bear his name, even if there is an
artificial theater on the spot. Mr. Weed,
In full academic regalia, said to the au
'tfience:
When the class of *91 reached the last term
Â«f their senior year the manner of observing
class day became a matter of considerable mo
ment, for there were many in the class who de
sired to break away from the traditional ob
servance and institute what they believed to be
a more pleasing ceremony. Before this time
the celebrations were held in co-efl canyon, a
Tittle distance east of the agricultural buildingC
The programme consisted of a class history, a
class poem, a prophecy, and- a dispensation*

WEED TELLS THINGS.
JOY PREVAILED.
Utma raaOU are all Greeks."
Â£ That was what President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler told
jf a vast audience at the ded
Â¦5a ieation^of the Greek open
air theater at the Univer
sity of California yesterday.
And so it wasâ the atmosphere, the fla
vor of the whole thing Â¦was Greek from
beginning to end. To begin with it had a
perfect Greek setting. The theater of
blocks of molded earth, rising tier upon
tier above the arena, and the great stage
stretching between tvro great pillared
masses, was even an improvement on the
Dlonyeiac theater of the old Greeks of
Athens. The day might nave been an
Athenian day, for nature was at her very
best and she sent here light and warmth
out of a flawless sky. The peopleâ the
Gretics of the Westâ were there In their
gayest costumes, and their western good
nature, emulating the Greeks of the East
And last, to make the picture a- master
piece, there came a Greek play, a com
tdy of twenty-four centuries ago, with its
Â¦witticisms and unique conception, to set
those Greeks of California a-laughjng â
"The Birds" of Aristophanes.' After all
It v.-as only a turning back of the hands
of the clock a few centuries.
There was only one thing that kept the
spectator from thinking himself an
Athenian Greek and that was the appear
ance In the arena of men in the garb of
this day and generation and speaking a
language that Is familiar to us all. No
there was one other thing that did thisâ
the "rooters" from the student body, the
bellows-lunged of liÂ»03 A. D.. with their
"'Ocki wow wows" and their "Hail Call
fornias." These young men simply tore
great holes in that yielding California air
and turned the hose of laughter on every
thing that happened t*o touch their funny
bones. The appearance of William Ran
dolph Hearst, with his wife, and Mrs.
Phoebe Hearst, his mother, with the
other members of their party, who held
seats on the edge of the arena, was the
signal for a great burst of applause from
the "rooters" and Mr. Hearst was com
pelled to doff his hat a number of times in
acknowledgment of the appreciation of
the students to the donor of the theater.
As in Greek .days the figurea wore
masks, very cleverly made, and the cos
tumes, owls, crows, eagles, TVe re all'con
spicuously picturesque and ingenious One
after : another, until twenty-four were
there. %he "birds hopped, skipped and flew
to tAe stage, crowing, cawing and pack
ing at the trees behind in comically real
istic fashion. Then froxa the tree trunk
whereon the great nest rested Pistheta
erus enters .with Euelpides, hi3 servant,
and the action begins.
Pisthetaerus plans the building of a city
in the air of which he la to be king and
the birds with marvelous quickness build
it, leaving him without his characteristic
grumble. This Is soon remedied, however,
for Iris, the spirit of the rainbow, tres
passes upon the new domain. Pisthe â
and the rest of itâ is again comfortably
discontented and has "kicks"- on hand for
the rest of the comedy. Prome'theusV rebel
to Zeus' authority, comes then to tell him
of the weakness of Zeus' -rule and then
Heracles. Poseidon and Triballus, envoys
of the goda. come to make terms With the
successful adventurer. Pisthetaerus ends
up, as frequently in real life, wlta a beau
tiful bride, a full purse and a kingdom
at his feet. \ .
The cast was remarkably efficient, and
much praise is due to those who trained
the players.
The huge comedy nest, with Its colossal
egg on the altar at the back of the
"orchestra." prepared one for the fun of
"The Birds." and though its language
was foreign to most* there was plenty
of its humor as Intelligible to-day as
when the comedy \ras first played. Pls
thetaerus, a political adventurer, who
turns everything to his own cnd3 and is
a magnificently self-satisfied person, be
comes disgusted with Athens and goes to
live In the klnsdom of the birds. The
comedy is the account of his subjugation
by guile and what we now occasionally
call "gall" of the feathered folk. Though
the political trickster's local allusions and
much else are now lost, the sly malice
and brilliant skill with which Aristoph
anes has- drawn the character _, are still
apparent. We find first the chorus, here
all of birds, and dumb save for bird-calls
fluttering and flopping- from the entrances
on to th* staee. i>'.J, : .-:. v
cant event of the dramatic year
In America. Under Greek skies. In the
heart of a Greek gTove, was gifted to a
people who have not carelessly been called
the Greeks of the West, a Greek temple
of the drama. It was impossible for the
coolest not to thrill to tho suggestion, to
the sight of the colossal crowd that filled
every Inch of the magnificent spaces of
the great building. It was a festival
never to be forgotten, the baptism, per
haps, of the coming national drama.
Strange it seemed at first to see aught
but the chiton and sandal of the Athen
ians against the classic background of
the auditorium, so eminently is the classic
atmosphere suggested. The theater, fash
ioned after the famous theater of Epl
daurus. Is in the heart of a grove of great
trees, the stately shell of the auditorium
leaning against a circling hill. The
"stage," with it3 severe platform and
majestic background of Corinthian col
umns, Is a noble picture In Itself. Below
It Is tho "orchestra," the ring wherein
the action takes place, wherein was given
yesterday the first Greek comedy pre
sented In America, wherein to-morrow
may be givenâ what?
"Rah! Rah! Rah! California!"â the mod
ern note was soon sounded. From base
to rim of the middle- section of the shell
sat the college boys, each with a mighty
throat of his own. Though the crowd was
handled with notable competence by the
college ushers, the' performance was na
turally somewhat late. But the Intermez
zos were lively and frequent. When Mrs.
Phoebe Hearst and William Randolph
Hearst arrived the youths cried "Rah!
Rah! Rah!" For Ben Weed, who dis
covered the happy hollow In the hills
where the theater now stands, they yelled
"Rah! Rah! Rah!" They yelled with
right good will for President Wheeler, for
President Jordan, for Professor John Ga
len Howard, and when there wasn't any
body to yell for they yelled, whistled and
crooned college songs for themselves. To
any manager fearful of the success of a
play I recommend the college youth. He
makes the yawn aÂ» extinct - aa u>Â« d<?4o
bird â talking of birds. To be dull or crit
ical In his lively vicinage Is Impossible
and as an entertainment between waits
he is also a bird. Yesterday until Pres
ident Wheeler. Mr. Hearst and Ben
Weed took the stage, he was a host In
himself. My gratitude to him.
"Mr. President, are you a bird? Is it
good to be here?" he yelled as the presi
dent took the stage.
Gravely the president answered then:
"It is good to be here," and introduced
to the audience Ben Weed as the fittest
person to speak first in the ceremonial
exercises.
"This will be a shrine where we can
meet the gods face to face," Mr. Weed
said In closing, and looked round at tho
vast place that grew from a psalm about
a fallen redwood tree some ten years ago.
John Galen Howard, architect of the the
ater, then spoke some great-hearted
words of hope for his art and the uni
versity, and President Wheeler followed
with further speech of noble prophecy.
Then Mr. Hearst, giver of the splendid
theater, gracefully deprecated the grati
tude of the university by saying that it
was at the suggestion, of his mother; Ulrs.
Phoebo Hearst, whoso generosity to the
university is a matter of familiar knowl
edge, that the gift had beenjmad*. Then
for Mr. Hearst the boys yelled "Rah!"
w^th a tiger, and then commanded lustiLVw
"Bring on .the birds!" - Â¦ .*"f*
"The Birds." next to "The Frogs" the
finest comedy of that mischievous satirist,
Aristophanes, was tho play chosen Â£o>

resented were arranged and- chosen by
Professor Flag, who also authored and
authorized the free translation that was
offered at the theater yesterday, The af
fair was under the direction of Professor
Richardson, who must be congratulated
on the notable success of his efforts A
large chorus, under Professor H. J. Stew

Notwithstanding reports to the
contrary, perfect tranquillity, al
most approaching apathy, prevails
throughout Bulgaria. There is not
the slightest outward evidence
that the country is on the verge of
war. Even in military circles
there is no excitement, though un
ceasing preparation is going on.
The reports emanating from
Turkish quarters that the Govern
ment is in danger of being carried
away by popular excitement and
that Bulgaria is likely to take the
first hostile steps may be regarded
as ridiculous inventions. It is.
however, a fact that all hope of
good results from the Turkish
promises of reform has long dis
appeared, and the feeling is grow
ing that war is the sole solution to
the Macedonian problem, the only
question being whether it will
come this autumn or be postponed
until spring.
The preparations for the.mobil
izing of the Bulgarian army have
been carried out with singular
completeness as to detail, and a
declaration of war will find the
Bulgarians sufficiently prepared.
The equipment for the soldiers is
ready, large quantities of am
munition are on hand and the
stocks of general supplies are re
markably comprehensive. The ap
pearance of the troops shows at
tention to details and theii
soldierly qualities are a revelation
to foreigners. The officers are
fully equipped for their profession
and the men willingly undergo
hard drill daily. General Xicolaieff

I fired, knocking my man down. At the,

companions of the captured and wounded
bandit, who gives his < name as Jim Con
ners, have apparently made their escape
from the scene of the Oregon Railroad
and Navigation hold-up last' night. Of
ficers returned late to-night from scour
ing the brush In the neighborhood of the
twenty-one mile post, but found nothing
that would be acceptable . as a clew to
their whereabouts.
Thus far the officers have not been able
to find any ground for doubting a theory
that the men escaped along the railroad
track, either to Portland or to a ren
dezvous near by.
The police early to-day arrested Harry
Cole, a young man who was found prowl
ing about the railroad yards. He acted
In a suspicious manner previous to his
arrest and attempted to escape from the
olllcers. W. J. Fruelock of Troutdale
was arrested by Bert Biesccker, Sheriff
of Clark County, and turned over to the
Sheriff to-night. The Clark County offi
cial was returning in a "buggy from.
Washougal when he met Fruelock. The
latter was invited to accomoany the
Sheriff in his buggy, and when the officer
learned that he was a Troutdale laborer
he notified the Portland officers.
The leader of the party, who calls him
self Conners, who was originally reported
as killed, but who proved to be wounded,
lies at the Good Samaritan Hospital. It
is not clear that he is even desperately
wounded, for the man's apparent lack of
interest in life and his eagerness to die
has the effect of making his condition
seem worse than it is.
LA GRANDE, Or., Sept. 24.â Express
Messenger Fred Korner's story of the at
tempted hold-up ot the Oregon Railroad
and Navagltlon train at Corbett last
night, told upon the arrival of the train
here to-day, is as .follows:
Special Dispatch to The Call. .
"The present state of affairs in the Turkish
vilayets, which is due to the criminal inten
!cns of committees and revolutionary bands,
lc+s not alter the attitude of the powers in
-cRard tc the programme of action adopted
*arly In the year by the powers most inter
Â¦B'ed. Consequently. Turkey nor Bulgaria can
r Â»iy on thÂ» support of anv power in the event
of open or. secret opposition to the realiza
tion of thts scheme."
The Impprial Government hopes this new
warning will convince Turkey, as well as Bul
garia, of the futility of any attempt to avoid
the fulfillment of the demands made upon
them, and both governments to take all the
measures In their power for the â¢ repression of
the disturbances in the Balkan peninsula,
which can only have the most serious conse
quences for both the Ottoman Empire and
Bulgaria.
In view of the thickening complications, the
Russian and Austrian governments have reiter
ated their views to this effect both at Sofia
and at Constantinople, and. acting on thÂ»
suggestion of Austria and Russia, all the gov
ernments of the powers which signed the
treaty of Berlin have instructed their repre
sentatives no Turkey and Bulgaria to empha
.Â»ize their full unanimity in the Austro-Rus
-â¢ian work of pacifying the Bulgarians, so as
to remove all misconceptions of possible as
sistance In the e%'ent of dangerous enterprises.
These representatives have been Instructed to
make a declaration to the governments of Tur
key and Bulgaria as follows:
This fatal conception, against which Rus
sia gave incessant warnings, has brought upon
the Christians in Turkish vllayeta grievous
oppression, which will end only when the In
cursion of insurgents from Bulgaria and the
revolutionary activity of the committees cease.
Not until then can the immediate application
of reform needed by the population, and by
which they will- be protected from Turkish
atrocities, be Instated upon, the most ener
getic endeavors having failed to bridle the
fanaticism of the Mussulmans.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sent. 24.-The Rus
sian Government has issued an official
note reiterating that the attitude of the
pov.-ers in resard to the Austro-Russ!an
reform scheme for Macedonia Is un
changed, and consequently neither Turkey
nor Bulgaria can expect support from any
quarter in the event of open or secret re
sistance to that scheme.
The Government after pointing out that
the suggested reforms were at the outset
attended by g-ood results, continues:
ThÂ°se, however, did Jiot satisfy the Mace
donian committees which hav* spmng up in
the Slav states. The probability which Jrtid
become apparent that the Christian popula
tion would calm down 'under the Influence of
reforms deprived these committees of all fa
vorable ground for the realisation of their
revolutionary plane. While proclaiming that
their object was the protection of their co
rellsiontets a^ainrt Turkish oppression, thess
coiEmittetg ia reality seek to attain their
s-IfÂ»h aim of modifying the administrative
system In the province bo as to convert it Into
a Bulgarian Macedonia, to the detriment of the
rights and privileges of the other Christian
people, whose interest is equally dear to ortho
dox Russia. As the leaders found no support
among the non-Bulgarian element in Macedo
nia, they exerted themseivta to raise Insurrec
tion by cruel outrages and terrorism in order
to hinder the projected reforms. Unhappily,
in spitÂ« of the precautions of the Sofia. Gov
ernment, the Macedonian agitation spread con
siderably in Bulgaria Itself, finding support
among those who mUtakingly reckoned that
the outbreak thus caused would compel Rus
sia to alter her programme and proclaim her
self the champion of the plans of the leaders
of the revolution.
Neither Turkey Nor Bulgaria Will
Profit by War.

SALONICA, Sept. 24.â Twenty-five fami

They have abandoned their homes out of
fear of the Turks. A mine has been dis
covered at Veles, twenty-seven miles from
Uskub. leading from a Bulgarian shop to
a point under the mosque. Several'arreste

PARIS, Sept. 24.â The French Foreign
Office officials doubt the sincerity of the
Porte's reply to the Bulgarian note, be
lieving it is merely a maneuver to impress
the powers with the idea that Turkey is
doing her utmost to effect a settlement
before 'going to war. A similar Impres
sion seems to prevail at Sofia, since Bul
garia in answering requires Turkey to
cease mobilizing, stop the massacres and
withdraw her troops from near the fron
tier before she will consider the proposals.

LONDON, Sept. 25.â The Dally Mall's
correspondent at Berlm -telegraphs the
sensational statement that there is a pos
siblity of a Kossuthist revolution in Hun
gary. ' He pays that as a result of the
German Emperor's visit to "Vienna Ger
many has promised to assist Austria with
troops should Austria be faced with the
necessity of using armed force in Mace
donia and simultaneously suppressing a
revolution in Hungary. That the latter
Is not Impossible, continues , the corre

that General von Beck, chief of the Aus
trian staff, submitted a plan of mobiliza
tion to Emperor William last week. The
idea of placing Prince Eitel Frederick,
the second son of the German Emperor,
on the Hungarian throne receives no sup
port in Germany.
BUDAPEST, Sept. 24.â The session of
the Diet to-day was marked by^stormy
scenes which became so boisterous as to
necessitate its suspension. Barabbas, a
member of the Kossuth party, went so
far as to say his party no longer believed
the statements of the Emperor-King
Francis Joseph. Charges made against
Premier Hedervary of "complicity In the
Szarpay bribery scandal started the dis
turbance.
On the resumption of business Count
Hedervary was speaking, when he was
suddenly Interrupted by Barabbas, who
shouted: "We don't believe the 1 King."
Thereupon 'all the Deputies, irrespective
of party, arose with shouts of: "Rogue!"
"Traitor!" "Out with him!"
Barabbas tried to apologize, but his col
leagues refused to permit and a' vote of
censure upon him was recorded on the
minutes.
The House finally adjourned until the
new Cabinet is formed.
LONDON. Sept. 24.â The presence of
several American women brightened the
proceedings of the Alaska Boundary
Commission to-day. David-T. Watson of
Pittsburg, of counsel for the American
side, continued the presentation of the
American case and expected to conclude
his argument to-morrow.
Mr. Watson devoted the morning to an
examination of Russia's title, pointing
out that everything in the Russo-Brltlsh
negotiations showed that Russia's de
mands for a boundary Involved the ex
clusive possession of all the coast line.
He contended that without such a boun
dary, excluding Great Britain from the
sea, the rest of the Russian possessions
would have been valusless.
Mr. Watson devoted the afternoon to
contending that Russia's primary idea wa3
to establish a barrier to prevent the ad
vance of British trade from the East,
while Great Britain at that time also de
sired a barrier in order to secure freedom
from the operations of the Hudson Bay
Company. These purposes, counsel
claimed, would have been completely
frustrated If the British had obtained the
head of Inlets.
The commission expects that the argu
ments will certainly be completed Octo

LONDON, Sept. 24.â America Is .now
reaping great benefit from the storms
which made the past summer one of the
worst on record in Great Britain and the
Continent. Thanks to the ruined home
crops/California fruit, Is being Imported
In larger quantltes than ever before. The
sales last week in London marked a rec
ord of 25,000 boxes of American fruit, rep
resenting about 675,000 pounds weight.
The fruit was sold at a two days' auc
tion in Covent Garden Market, the prices
averaging 30 per cent above what has
heretofore been obtained here. The sales
were chiefly of California pears and plums
with a fair- consignment of New York
State Bartlett pears. There is practically
no English fruit obtainable, while France,
which usually exports large quantities of
pears to England, is sending none. I
The American section of Covent Gar
den Market Is now almost the sole source
of supply, and there are no signs of the
demand decreasing. ; ; Â¦Â¦
A member of the most prominent Eng
lish firms dealing in foreign fruit said to
a press correspondent:
"There has never been anything like it.
Heretofore California fruit has b*en more
of an adjunct to England's supply than a
serious factor In the market. Now, owing
to the failure of French fruit arid the
complete loss of the home crop the Amer
ican branch of the market is" watched
more eagerly than any other."
Following are the current quotations
per box: California pears, $1 94 to $2 30;
California plums, $2 43@2 91; Bartlett
pears, $1 S2@2 30; peaches, $2 43@" 67.

Dr. Stockton, when leaving the hotel
shortly before 6 o'clock, said:
"Mrs. Davis is in a serious condition,

excused from discussing her case further
to-night. To-morrow morning perhaps we
will be able to make a statement."
Mrs. Davis camel to Castle Inn on Mon

LONG'S WARM GREETING.
Edwin J. Lynch took the floor to second
the nomination of Mr. Laumeister. He
also paid many tributes to him as a citi
zen and public official. When the cheer
ing had subsided "Mr." Laumeistcr was
nominated by acclamation^ and a commit
tee was appointed to bring him before the
delegates.' Unfortunately Mr. Laumeister
was not in the hall and t^e delegates had
to forego the, pleasure off listening to his
speech of acceptance. . .
If .the .applause for Laumeister was
great that which greeted the name of
Percy V. Long, the convention's nominee
for City Attorney, was an ovation. - The

LAUMEISTER CHEERED.
When Charles Laumeister's name was
placed before the convention ag a candi
date for Assessor, it was received with
genuine enthusiasm. William J. Herrln
placed the prominent citizen in nomina
tion. Throughout the address the dele-
Bates applauded the candidate. There
were kindly words uttered on every side.
Laumeister is looked upon as a splendid
candidate and will be able to give Asses
sor Dodge a hard fight for . re-electton.
Herrin's speech was as follows: -
I wish to place in nomination for the Im
portant office, of Assessor of this city and
county a man well known to all of you, who
some years ago was nominated for the office
of Sheriff of this ctty and county. He was
elected by a majority of several thousand
votes, and he filled the office with credit to
himself and with honor to the people. He was
afterward elected upon the Railroad Commis
sion of this State. That commission came in
under the new constitution, and It haa been
one of the most useless commissions we have
had; but tvhen Mr. Laumeieter was elected
to it he felt that a public office was a public
trust. Where Hid you find Mr. Laumelster
when ho was upon that commission? you
found him on the side of the people; you found
him reducing- the rates on grain and on oil.
He took a bold and a fearless stand for the
people of the State of California, and that is
the kind of a man Charles S. Laumelster la;
he is a bold and a fearless man, and he feels
it to be his duty to fill his office for the ben
efit of his constituents. 'Â¦Â¦
Mr. Laumeistcr is popular with the working
people; bo employs a lot of men in his mills
and he has the good will | of those . people,
and we need just such a man as he Is at
this very time when we are between . the up
per and the lower millstones, when we are
under the" State Board of Equalization, which
seema to think that it has to assess the
property ot this city â¢ for more than It should
be F.8sesscd. We need Just such a man as
Laumelste; as Assessor of thia city, who will
stand up .and ': do his duty and say to - the

tion: There have been many humorous things
said here in support of my candidacy, some in
compliment and some in jest, and all that I can
say is that the many nice things said of me I
hope that I will be able to fulfill should I be
selected by the people of this city and county
aa their City Attorney. I heartily indorse the
platform framed and adopted by you in con

for the term provided by law I shall make it

cf this city and county some years ago. (Ap

government and law and order, expect me to

who was to place General Edward S.
Salomon in nomination. Haven was first
to be recognized, and amid cheers for Mc-
Gowan he delivered the following eulogy
on' his candidate: 'vrl-
There are three departments of our city
government which are of/ peculiar interest to
the residents of this city, because to them is
committed the protection of our t>erson and
the safety of our homes and families: and
not the least among these three departments is
the office of District Attorney. Our police
department may be never to efficient; our
Police Judges may be never so courageous and
conscientious, but unless the public prosecutor
Is a man capable and efficient In his office
this city will become the home of the footpad
and the asylum of every other class of crim
inals known to mankind. A District Attorney
should not only be efficient, he should be
thorough; he should be a man who is well
grounded in the law. who stands well In his
profession, and who at the name time has a
thorough knowledge of men. The average crim
inal is nobody" s fool and It takes a sharp man
to prosecute him: the prosecutor should be
fully as keen as the man whom ho piosecutes.
The man Â¦ whom I propose to nominate is one
able to perform the duties of this office.
Starting in this State as a printer, he ha*
by his own industry and efforts, and only by
his own Industry and efforts, raised himself
to a position In his profession of eminence.
He has served his State In the Legislature for
ten consecutive years; one term In the lower
house two terms in the upper bouse. While
In the Senate he was chairman cf the moat
important committee -in that body, the Judi
ciary Committee. He was the author of and
obtained the passage of some very Important
legislation which has always been a benefit and
will always remain of benefit to the resident*
of this State; such acts, for Instance,
as the act which established the
State high schools; such acts as that which
made the office of State Printer elective; guch
acts &a that which provided that it was a
misdemeanor to place a laborer's name upon
a blacklist simply because he belonged to a
labor union. At the termination of his term
of office In the Senate he was made, aa a to
ken of esteem for the service which he had
performed for his constituents, an honorary
member, of a typographical union. HU sym
pathies are naturally and stronsly with thÂ«
laboring people. His experience haÂ« enabled
him to judge of men. to put himself in a po
sition to- know men when he sees them, it is
with feelings of confidence that the gentle
man whom I\am about to name win be nom
inated by thlf convention, and with a feeling
of confidence that if nominated he will h<Â»
elected, that I have the honor of placing be
for* this convention for nomination for Dis
trlct Attorney of this city and county the
Hon. Frank McOowan. (Great applause )
CREATES MERRIMENT.
Lincoln E. Savage took the platform to
second the nomination of Mr. McOowan
He spoke at length and created some
merriment by the earnestness of his plea
for his friend's nomination. At the con
clusion of Savage's address Judge Schejj
attempted to make a speech, i but was
stricken with stage fright and had to de
sist He was greeted with loud calls for
encampment In this city. You know how gra
ciously we received and entertained those
Brand men who fought for tnls country, and
it is owing to the executive ability of Mr.
Luta that the success of that entertainment
and encampment waÂ« ho prominent. Mr. Lutz
is a man who belongs a great many fra
ternal societies and in those societies in every
instance he has been honored. He has been
elected to offices In every one. and his friends
in those societies have placed the greatest
confidence In him. He is a sreat man for
charity. To-day Mr. Lutz is one cf the di
rectorate of the German Hospital, tnd among
the German societies in San Francisco he Is
one of the strongest. He is respected and
admired among; hi? neighbors and friends in
the Thirty-ninth District and I will say further
that he has the unanimous Indorsement and
support of thf delegates of the Forty-third
Assembly District, of which Hon. Thomas D.
Rlordan is the chairman.
And gentlemen, by way of political argu
ment, permit me to eay tJjls: Mr. R'.ordan,
whom you all know, has worked indefatigably
In promoting the candidacy Â»Â»r Mr. Lutz, and
it has been told me by friends who I know
tell the truth, those who are older than I am
in DoUtics, that Mr. Itiordan has worked
thirteen. or fourteen years in the effort to aid
honest Republican politics and he has asked
nothing. I will say this, that if Mr. Riordan
should come before this Convention and try
to nominate a man who was not popular,
honest and tried, who warf not available as a
candidate, then I would say it is your duty
to turn him down; but on the other hand
when Mr. Rlordan, a faithful .warhorse, gives
you a man who is honest, fair, square and
uprIght-â(Confuslon and cries of "Time" â Gen
tlemen, I see that you are here for action; you
d<? not care to hear from .me. and I believe
that ylM\ ail feel as I do concerning Mr. Lutz.
Therefore, I again place for â¢ nomination before
thin convention for the office of Public Ad
ministrator the name of William E. Lutz.
(Applause.) >
NOMINATED BY ACCLAMATION.
Charles Sonntag seconded Lutz's nom
ination. He praised the candidate for his
high standing 'as a Republican and as a
soldier. He said Lutz would add strength
to the ticket If nominated.- There being
no further nominations, Lutz was elected
by acclamation and the secretary of the
convention .was directed to cast tho bal
lot of the Convention â 319 votes â for him.
There were loud cries for "Billy" Lutz,
and the popular candidate was escorted
to the platform amid great applause. In
part he said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: I desire to thank you for the unanimous
nomination for the office of Public Administra
tor and promise to support this ticket from
top to bottom and do the best I can for the
election of every man who is nominated in this
convention from now on until election. I thank
you.
Nominations for Recorder were next on
the programme, and Louis Jacobs, a dep
uty in the Sheriff's office, was nominated
without opposition. Mr. Jacobs had many
friends in the convention' and they ap
plauded loudly for him. Walter S. Brann
placed Jacobs in nomination. He said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: S All of you Republicans and members of
this convention are men who have property;
I take it that you have. You want the records
and title ot that property kept all right; you
want to know when you go to the Recorder's
office. that your title on the records will be such
that you can find out what you own, and every
body else can, unless it is your creditors. There
Is a man here before you who wishes to havw
his name go before this conx-entlon. who has
been connected with various public offices and
has always done his duty well., I refer' to
Louis Jacobs of the Fortieth District. If you
rive him the nomination of this convention he
will be our next Recorder and he will be a
good one. I place him in nomination.
Judge Altken and others seconded the
nomination of Jacobs. There were â¢ no
further nominations and Jacobs received
the entire vote of the convention. Upon
being called before . the delegates to in
dorse the platform Mr. Jacobs said:
I thank you for the' honor you have bestowed
upon me. I heartily indorse your platform,
and if elected I promise you that I shall con-
iftÂ«CW Â«A HE Republican local eonven
y tion completed its work in

{{ Journed sine die -with three
Â¦*Â»Â¦ rousing cheers for the excel-
lent ticket. The delegates
were in Alhambra Theater at 8 o'clock,
the time scheduled for the convention
to meet, but they were not called to or
der until S:15. During the waiting time
two efforts to adjust the slate to the
ratiffaction of the majority proved so
successful that there were only two con
tests in open session. Friends of former
State Senator Frank McGowan declined
to g1\Â»j the right of way to General E. S.
Salomon for District Attorney. Suppl
er* of Colonel Thomas O'Neil insisted on
placing bis name before the convention
for County Clerk in opposition to the
plated candidate. John Greif. The oppo
nents of the programme were highly en
thusiastic, but were not formidable in the
voting contest. In every instance the
slate prevailed and the choice of the con
vention was made unanimous.
The minority delegates promised Un
faltering- devotion to the whole ticket.
The signal of loyalty all along:- the line
from the Twenty-eighth to the Forty
fourth district was greeted with cheers.
A little confusion was created by one
incident of the session. Judge George
OT. Schell, who went to the platform to
place General Salomon in nomination for
District Attorney, was overcome by an
attack of vertigo at the beginning of his
remarks. His place on the platform was
promptly filled by Colonel John C. Currier
of the Forty-first District. The incident
caused a demonstration in the ranks of
Senator McGowan's supporters, leading
them to entertain the hope that opposi
tion to their candidate had vanished.
A. Ruef participated in the proceedings
of the convention, and was selected by
the delegates representing the 'Forty
fifth Assembly District as a member of
the new governing body of the Repub
lican party of San Francisco.
NOMINATIONS ABE MADE.
Staunch and True Men Offered to
the Voters.
Chairman Partridge called the Republil
can Municipal Convention to order at 9:15
o'clock last evening, one hour and a quar
ter after the time scheduled for the meet
ing. The delay was caused by some trou
ble in making the slate satisfactory to the
friends of J. George Boyne and Colonel
Thomas F. O'Neil, who were candidates
for the nomination of County Clerk. The
first business of the evening was the nom
ination of a Public Administrator. Wil
liam E. Lutz was placed in nomination
by John T. Williams of the Thirty-ninth
District. Mr. Williams spoke as follows:
The Thirty-ninth Assembly District has
among Its residents a candidate for the office
of Public Administrator. Ours is a young dis
trict. It has the shortest political history of
any district in this city and county, and some
of the co-delegates of my delegation have sug
gested to me that, inasmuch as I was the
youngest delegate in our delegation I should
place his name before you ac being appropriate
to a young i>oliUcal assembly district.
The man whom we are to name for this of
fice ha* been a resident of this city and county
for thirty-five years. For many years laet past
he ha* been an ardent, rtaunch, earnest worker
rcr the Republican party. When 14 years of
age, having been born north of Mason and
Vixon't line, he enlisted in the Northern army
and fought through the war; his career there
was gallant and he was often commended. To
day he iÂ« an honored member of the' George

I mean, and -I place before this convention a*
a candidate for your consideration for nomina
tion to the office of Public Administrator of

THE NOMINEES.
McGowan by the friends cf that candi
date, who were anxious to break tho
slate. Colonel John C. Currier sprang to
the platform and took Schell's place
and in an earnest speech nominated hid
friend. He spoke as follows:
It waÂ» my pleasure to know a distinguished
old soldier who fought through the war for
his country, and I am proud to bear the ban
ner of his tolls here to-night; a gentleman who
has been eloquent in the halls of legislation;
one who has distinguished himself in all the
walks of life. I was not Intending to place
him In nomination before thl3 convention, but
it teems Judge Schell has made a mistake, and
therefore I have assumed the honor, aa I be
lieve It to be, to nominate for ycur consider
ation to-night for the office of District At
torney, General Edward S. Salomon. General
Salomon has a distinguished war record. He
served through the war; enlisting In 1S61.
He served four years and three months, and
during that time he fought in more than two
dozen battles. General Salomon's name is
not only known here, but he has a national
reputation. He has been many times in offi
cial positions and In every position has dis
tinguished himself and discharged Its duties
with great honor and credit to himself and
his country. I ask you to cast your vote for
that distinguished soldier and that gallant
gentleman. General Edward S. Salomon. (Ap
plause.)
SECONDED BY WALDHE1MEB.
M. J. "Waldheimer of the Thirty-seventh
Assembly District the nomina
tion of General Salomon. A roll call soon
developed that McGowan was not in it.
Near thecloseof the roll call Savage moved
that General Salomon's nomination be
made by acclamation and the secretary
cast tho vote for the candidate. General
Salomon was invited to the platform and
when the applause had subsided spoke aa
follows:
This episode in this convention reminds me
of my younger days. There was a time whSn
I liked and admired a contest. Thoae con
tests were of a different kind, but still I en-
Joyed this one. And when 1 say I enjoyed it
I do not say anything that my friend Mr. Mtr-
Gowan may take exception to. He la a worthy
young gentleman, whom I honor and respect,
and while I am very much pleased and thank
you with all my heart for the confidence la
me that you have shown this evening. If . I
could not have had the majority of your votes
I could jiot have selected sl better iruin tH*ifi
Frank McGowan to get it. (Applause.)
Under the circumstances, and this being the
first contest there has been in this convention,
you will pardon me If I say a few more words
than you desire to hear. I am an old Repub
lican. I heartily approve of your platform and
the declaraticn of principles that was read to
you last night, but that Is not a difficult
thing for me to do. I have Indorsed, advo
cated, applauded and upheld the principles of
the Republican party from the days of Abra
ham Lincoln until now. (.Applause.)
The gentleman who received your nomination
for City Attorney, a worthy, good, strong young
man. was mentioned here n.-< a representative
of the younger element In this party; let me
be a representative of the old men in the party,
one of those who was present at the birth of
this great and glorious national party that has
carried our country to unprecedented victory,
prosperity and success. And to show you that
I am worthy of the confidence that you have
placed In me, I will pledge myself to work
from thia minute until the sun goes down on
November 3 with all the energy that Is in me.
with all the power I possess and with what
little ability Is mine for he success of the
whole Republican ticket that you place In the
field; and I tell you that I have no <<eiibt, un
der the present circumstances, with the great,
harmonious, united party that we now repre
sent, that our ticket next November will be
successful. To my friends here who have said
such kind word3 of me I am grateful, and to
you gentlemen for the preference you have
shown I extend my hearty thanks. I cannot
acknowledge your confidence and your kindness
any better than by endeavoring ttf have myself,
with all my associates on this ticket, elected,
and when elected endeavoring to discharge the
duties of this important office In such a man
ner that you will never regret your action la
selecting me.
MOREIS FCÂ£t CORONER.

Forty-second Assembly District mounted
the platform and placed the name of Dr.
T. H. Morris before the convention. Ha
spoke, as follows:
It is Indeed a pleasure to mÂ» at thlÂ» time
to address this Republican Convention, tha
delegates to which reoresent a united Repul>
lican party. I believe that the citlzena of this
city and county are deeply sensible or an ob
ligation which they owe to the Republican
party for rescuing this city from an apparent
position of obscurity and lifting it into thÂ«
gaze of the entire world as one of the most
prominent commercial cities In it. I believe
further that the citizens of this city are only
anxiously waiting for the opportunity to dem
onstrate that spirit by electing the nominees
that this convention has placed befcra them
without exception. The nominations that have
been made by this convention arÂ» those of
men of sterling character and worth, as well
as of stupendous political value. It is my
pleasure at thist time, and likewise an honor.
to place before you in nomin-atlon for -tha
office of Coroner a gentleman who possesses
the worth, private merit and sternness of
character that his business requires, equal
if not superior to that of any who have been
placed In nomination before this convention.
It is my pleasure to place in nomination Dr.
T. H. Morris for Coroner.
There was no opposition to Dr. Morris
and he was nominated by acclamation.
In accepting the nomination the doctor

dence you have reposed 1 In me In selecting mÂ«
aa your nominee for the office of Coroner. . I
am thoroughly in accord with the principles
of the party as stated In the platform and
heartily Indorse them. It is unnecessary for
me to state that 1 have beer, a life-long Re
publican; that I have lived in this city for
the last eighteen years, practicing my profes
sion. During the campaign I will not only
work for my own success, but for that of the
entire Republican ticket, and if I am elect.-'J
I will use my best endeavors to- cenduct my
office in a business 1 way and to the satisfac
tion of the entire people..

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
To extend this flow by an extra high
tide to Tenth and Harrison streets is
even more serious, although more excep
tional; but high tides are Inevitable every
year and the effect of this must be con
sidered In this, connection. The gravity
of the Questions Involved Is made more
striking by the fact that the sewer sys
tem Is to be put In for a long series of
years and the difficulties that Inhere in
the proposed system will be permanent.
The accuracy of the statements concern
ing the flooding of the main sewer by the
tides twice each day cannot be questioned
successfully.
Water seeks its own level. The bot
tom of the main sewer Is In many places
below the level of ordinary higrh tide.
Official records to be found at the City
Hall furnish the basl3 for each averment
concerning the main sewer in Its rela
tion to the level of the tides.
"While It Is a disaster to incur a debV
of millions of dollars for something that
is unsatisfactory and Inadequate, there is
also another side to. the matter, of pos
sibly greater gravity: If the bonds should
be Issued and the new sewer system
should be established and It should then
appear that the work had been performed
without proper consideration of all the
difficulties, and that they who had ad
vocated it zealously, with sincere desire
to promote the public good, had been as
the blind following the. blind, future fro
gress might be hampered badly by the
distrust naturally following so unfortu
nate an experience.
In consideration of the great sum of
money to be voted for the proposed sewer
system, and not less on account of vital
considerations of health and comfort, the
earnest attention of the business com
munity and of all good citizens is earn
estly Invited. The sources of information
are official and open to all. "What Is
meant by flooding the main sewer with
tidal water out to Sixth and Howard
streets twice every day in the year and
checking the flow of sewage in a vast
drainage area during the entire periods of
rising tides Is easily apparent to every
one.
The fall for the North Point main
through its course of nearly four miles,
and that largely in a populous district and
through the principal business part of
the city, is only one foot for every 1900
feet, or less than three feet to the mile. It
is very questionable .whether with that
low grade the sewage, largely mixed with
sand during the winter, will make its
way to the North Beach outlet, being
crowded back twice every day by the
tidal waters.
Feet to Mile of Pipes.
FALL IS VERY SLIGHT.
Grade Averages Less Than Three
In addition to the tidal difficulty In
volved In the sewerage system plan that
underlies the present proposition there Is
another serious physical condition to be
considered. For many years to come,
and Indeed until the enormous drainage
areas that have been herein enumerated
are covered with bitumen and cement
and houses, the great sand wash Into the
main, will be a source of trouble. Espe
cially in winter will there be an Immense
inflow of sand.
opposite to the direction of the current of
sewage will produce In the sewer calm
water and the heavy particles In the sew
age will be deposited. This will go' on
during- the entire period of the Inflow of
| the rising tides. As the extra high tide
runs more than two feet above the or
dinary high tide, and the sewer at North
Beach has an outlet of eight feet in
diameter, the sewer mouth will be com
pletely filled by such tide and there will
be an absolute blockade of the entire out
let. Meanwhile the tidal water will run
up as far as Tenth and Harrison streets.
All accumulated sewer gases will be
driven out through the cesspools at street
corners or into the houses of citizens.

RADICAL DEFECT IS DISCOVERED IN THE PROPOSED
CITY SEWER SYSTEM INVOLVING DIRE CONSEQUENCES
IT is ascertained that if the plans for a sewer system for this city, iforming. the basis i of the proposed sewer bond issue, are carried to accomplishment, owing to the
depression of the sewers below the city base there is -certain to be serious daily interference . owing _ to "the inflow of the tides twice every twenty-four hours. While
the tides are rising, the great North Point sewer, the main key to the entire system, will be practically, useless for hours. Sewage will be backed up twice daily.

Since the original plan for the North
Point main was made it has been deter
mined to change the route for a part of
the distance. It was originally intended
to have the main sewer along Montgom
ery street. Upon further investigation,
as set up in a supplementary 1 report that
was filed last July with the Board of
Supervisors, "it has been found prefer
able to adopt a route from Howard street
along Second street to Market, a short
distance on Market street to Sansome and
along Eansome street to the northern
water front, northwesterly to the point
of outfall heretofore selected, as shown
on the plans."
This change causes the North Point
main to run under Sansome street
through the wholesale section Instead of
through Montgomery street. Attention is
called to this In all fairness, as the pro
files supplied to the public by the City
Engineer apply to Montgomery' street, in
etead of Sansome. The question of the
effectiveness of the North Point main
sewer Is no way concerned with this
change, as the grades are only so slight
ly different as to make no essential dfl
ference In considering the Inflow of the
tidal waters and the backing up of all
sewage during such twice dally run.
BELOW THE BASE LINE.
At Sixth and Howard Streets Oppos
ing Currents Will Meet.
\ At Howard and Second streets the bot
tom of the proposed sewer will be abqut
nine feet below the city base, or two feet
an8 three inches below ordinary high
tide.
At\ the crossing of California and San
sodka streets. In the very, heart of the
banking and wholesale section of San

main *ill be ten feet below the city base,
or threi feet and three inches below or
dinary b.igh tide. ' .
At Sansome and Jackson streets the
Nearly four miles from the point where
the outlet of the North Point main sewer
is to be, or a distance of about 20,000 feet,
namely at Division and Eighteenth
streets, near the junction of Treat avenue
and Eighteenth street, It Is' ascertained
from the profiles furnished by the City-
Engineer In the report on a system of
sewers, that there the bottom of the
sewer will be two feet and seven inches
below the city base, or two feet and seven
Inches below the tops of the wharves on
the city front.
At the crossing of Howard and Sixth
streets, where the .grade of the%treet Is
ten feet above the city base, the bottom
of the main sewer is planned to lie six
teen feet and nine Inches below the
street crossing, or- six feet and nine
Inches below the city base, which means
that it Is about the level of ordinary high
tide. An extreme high tide runs about
two feet and three Inches higher than the
ordinary high tide. This would put the
bottom of the sewer at Sixth and Howard
streets two fset and three inches below
the level of an extreme high tide.
Official mar>s that have been consulted
show that the North Point main sewer is
so far belo^r the city base line that twice
dally it will ba flooded by the tide to
Sixth and Howard streets. During these
periods of tidal flow the sewage will be
crowded backward. The gases In the
sewer will be forced out through cess
pools and into dwellings, corrupting the
air and bringing diseases.
In no spirit of hostility does The Call
this morning direct attention to the per
tinent facts that constitute the very core
cf the sewer question. The astonishing
discovery, epitomized in the foregoing, of
such great importance to the people, is
given publicity as soon Â£.s possible. Many
taxpayers, learning the facts, -will find
herein a timely and necessary warning.
By the facts alona can this article bÂ«
Judged. It cannot but appear that the
sewer system as designed is wrong in con
ception. There is yet time for deliberate
and sober consideration.
Attention is invited to the statements
that follow, all of which are based upon
official records, ine'erfing the profiles to
be found in iha "report on a system of
sewerage for the city snu county of San
Francisco," Â¦which has received official
sanction and en the publications in whicr.

Inflow From Bay Interferes With
Operation of Drain.
CROWDS SEWAGE BACK.
If the sewer system shall be constructed
a3 planned by the city authorities it is
definitely ascertained the great North
Point main sewer, which is to drain the
greater part of the city, will, for a long
distance, twice every day In the year be
flooded by the ordinary high tides and the
tide waters will run twice every twenty
four hours through the sewer to the junc
tion of Slxthvind Howard streets. Every
extra high tide, such as is common at a
certain season, will back up in the sewer
as far as Tenth and Harrison streets.
The business section of the city Is to
be drained by. the North Point main
sewer. The lands to be served by this
sewer include also the Islais Creek dis
trict up to Ocean View station, the entire
Hayes Valley district, the Park Pan
handle district, the entire Mission district
Â¦west of Harrison street and up to
Twenty-sixth street and the entire south
erly slopes of Pacific Heights clear down
to the line of the sewer.
The North Point main sewer is the
principal key to the entire proposed new
eewer system. Instead of running off sew
age from the higher levels to the water
the plan has been based upon running
everything down to zero and there trying
to handle it. This Is as if a sixteen-stjry
building wcr-i to be drained first into the
basement and then an effort should ba
made to get rid of the incubus unneces
sarily brought there.

had heard loose talk of lynching, but
nothing of that kind was attempted, and
it was only the result of momentary pas

the office the men employed by him as

would fleck to his support and dig into
their pockets for funds to keep him where

man of the County Clerk, was sent upon
a trip through the office to feel the finan

not warm, for Mahony's clerks rather like
the idea of drawing full salaries during
the last few months of Mahony's tenure
of office, and they made unexpected re
pponses that dampened McKenna's zeal.
Some eald they would see about the as
sessment and others flatly refused to "put
up." The number that refused was aug

discuss the matter, so Mahony was com

Mr. O'Nell had no chance of securing tho
nomination, although he had some days

been the storm center of many a political bat
tle, but despite the fact the battle has waged
fiercely above the heads of the Incumbents of
that office, no matter how fiercely, no matter
how Btrongr the opposition, there has been one
man in that County Clerk's office who haa
been thoroughly free from the breath of sus
picion, and that man, gentlemen, is John J.

savage mood and only an order from Gov

- OB.IGHT OF THE TROUBLE.
United States Senator Patterson and ex-
Governor Thomas, who were a few days
ago engaged by the County Commission
ers as counsel to advise them during the
occupation of the district by the military,
were in the courtroom and pleaded with
the spectators to be calm. For a moment
it appeared that blood would be shed, but
the gentlemen prevailed on the people and
some order wa6 restored.
Several members of the throng made in
timidating remarks and an order was
given by the officer in command to bring
bayonets Into requisition. The soldiers
responded quickly and drove the crowd
at the point of the bayonet to the rear
of the courtroom.
and the militia as a result of
the refusal of General John Chase to obey
the order of Judge Seeds in the District
Court to-day, directing that he, discharge
fnyn the custody of the military four
prisoners for whom writs of habeas cor
pus were issued. The court decided that
the military could not supersede tha civil
â¢authorities under the provisions of both
the Federal 1 and % the State 'constitutions,
and ordered the men released, but General
Chese refused to comply with the order
of the court and. In the face of a threat
ening crowd of union miners, took the
prisoners from the courtroom back to
Camp Goldfleld, near Victor.
After the defl was made by General
Chase to the court a scene was enacted
which has hardly a parallel In the history
of the country. Mrs. Sherman Parker,
wife of one of the prisoners, threw her
self between the soldiers and Parker and
shouted that no power would tear her
from her husband. When a soldier seized
her and made an effort to put her aside
she swooned in his arms and the crowd
pressed about the excited group.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 24.â Sam
Parks and his followers are now prac
tically In control of the convention of the
International Association of Bridge and
Srtuctural Iron Workers. Parks and his
friends are reticent about what they will
do with their power, but it is claimed by
the Parks element that R. EX Nedig,
president of the union of which they are
members in New York, and Frank Buch
anan, president of the international as
sociation* have been repudiated and will
be. deposed.. Parks says that Kedig was
deposed .before he. left. New York for. the
convention, but that upon the return to'
New York of the delegation- decisive ac
tion will be taken in regard to Nedig.
"So far as concerns building operations
now under way, it is safe to say that the
Employers' Association feels perfectly
easy. It has enough iron workers in tho
independent union to supply its demand."
"The Employers'. Association Is abso
lutely unconcerned wjiether Parks won or
lost at Kansas City, so far as Its cam
paign is concerned," said L. K. Prince,
vice president of the organization. "Of
course, it regrets to see that a convicted
felon Is leader of 4000 workmen. We are
recognizing that his apparent victory out
there will postpone the dissolution of his
empire. Wo will go ahead dealing only
with unions that have -signed the arbi
trary agreement.
"These union men who have followed
Parks blindly will be enthusiastic now and
no doubt will reaffirm their allegiance to
him with extravagant demonstration, but
the time is coming when they will realize
what this has cost them. Tha realiza
tion will be forced on them by the dis
covery that this winter there will be less
work for them than there has been in
many years.

that there will be, less- building operations

DETROIT. Mich., Sept. 24.â The Win

hoon took action in regard to the expen
diture of the $20,000 made by President
W. H. Gray of Syracuse, -N. -T., and the
executive committee last spring-, for the
of August by the Western Federation of
Miners in support of mill men at Color
ado City and other points who had for a
long time been contending for an eight
hour day. The mine owners, alleging- that
a large percentage of the men desired to
work If protection were assured, called
upon Governor Peabody for troops, al
though the local authorities denied the
necessity for such a course. The Gov
ernor, however, decided that troops, were
needed and on September 4 ordered al
most the entire National Guard of the
State, about 1000 men, to the district, un
der command of Brigadier General Chase.
Since that time several prominent mem
bers of the Miners' Union, including all
the members of the executive committee,
which had the strike in charge, have been
arrested without warrant and held in the
guardhouse. Habeas corpus proceedings
were begun in their behalf last week.
General Chase and his legal advisers held
that though martial law had not been
formally declared, It was really put in
force by the order issued by the Governor
directing the troops to maintain order,
and therefore the civil court had no Juris
diction.

WILKESBARRE, Pa., Sept. 24.--.S0me 27,000 mine workers are thrown idle by the de
cision of three of the large coal companies to work short time until the coal in the
market now is in more active demknd." The Lehigh Valley, with' 8500 men, will shut
\ down each Saturday and Monday, possibly until the end of October. The Susquehanna Coal
Company, controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad, will close its mines and suspend 7400 men
on Fridays and Saturdays of each week. The Delaware and Hudson this morning started a
weekly three days' suspension by closing its twenty-six workings and laying idle nearly 11,000
men. The loss in wages to these men will reach the sum of about $115,000 weekly and* each
week 600,000 tons of coal which they could have produced will remain unmined. The Philadel
phia and Reading, which has some collieries closed now, is expected to order two days a week
' suspension next week and to continue until the end of October.

.Governor Peabody said that this would
also apply to all prisoners that may be

the civil authorities failed to prosecute
the men who are charged with crimes.
The delegates to the Democratic Mu
nicipal Convention met for a few min
utes in Union Square Hall last night and
adjourned to meet in the Alhambra Thea
ter on next Monday night. The excuse
given by the leaders was that the hall
was too small to accommodate the dele
gates and friends of the Democracy.
Those who are on the inside gay the
adjournment^as taken in order to give
Franklin K. lane an opportunity to de
cide whether he would take the nomina
tion for Mayor. It is said that Mr. Lane
wants more harmony in the party and
that an effort is being made to bring the
two factions together. Another reason is
that the Democratic convention is desir
ous of seeing what the Union X,abor con
vention does on next Saturday night.
When Chairman Thomas W. Hickey
called the meeting to order, Thomas E.
Curran arose and asked for an adjourn
ment. He stated the hall was too small.
For the first time in the convention there
was harmony. William Ho ft Cook, one
of the leaders of the minority, seconded
the motion to adjourn and before it could
be carried half the delegates were on their
way down the street. .

field instead' of on the Stanford campus,
as scheduled.
Arrangements had -been made to have
the freshman inter-collegiate game played
on the Stanford and Berkeley campus
gridirons on alternate years. Last year
was the first time the plan had been put
in practice and It proved a financial suc
cess with the game on the Berkeley cam
pus, but as a large crowd could not be
expected with the game held this year
on the Stanford oval, the managers de
cided to bring the game off in San Fran

DENVER, Sept. 24.â Lulu Long of this
city is in a dangerous condition at St.
Anthony's hospital from eating chicken
sandwiches, the meat of which, according
to thc physicians attending her, contained
ptomaines or arsenic. Together with two
sisters, Miss Long had been filling an
engagement at a theater in Pueblo, and
on Saturday night last partook of a
lunch provided by a trapeze performer
named VAlglon. The lunch consisted of
chicken sandwiches, and almost imme
diately after eating them, two of the sis
ters were seized with pains in the stom
ach and were only relieved by powerful
medicines. Miss Lulu, whose sufferings
at first were slight, declined to be
treated, and it was several hours before
she began to feel the effects of the poison.
She became so ill, however, that she was
brought to this city and later placed In
the hospital and grave fears are felt for
her recovery. Her father, a commission
merchant of this place, has telegraphed
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 24.â At the Navy

Nicholson, who was said to be drunk at
the time, was convicted by court-martial
and sentenced to a reduction of five num

Rear Admiral Evans, commanding the
Asiatic station, in his review of the find

NEW YORK, Sept. 24.â Kept a prisoner
in a factory in this city for a month and
stupefied by drugs so that he could make
no effort to escape, to prevent him expos^
ing the secrets of a patent process for
cleaning furs, is the remarkable story told
by Ernest C. Webb, a lawyer, when he
was rescued by a policeman who was
armed with a warrant sworn out by Mrs.
Webb charging her husband with aoan
dor.mtnt. The wife's charge was a ruse
to get into the factory, as several pre
vious attempts had failed.
According to Webb's statement he was
induced about a month ago to go to the
place and has since been unable to leave
It. He was locked in a back room, on an
upper floor, where his meals were brought
with considerable quantities of whisky,
which, he declares, contained drugs. The
police found Webb lying on a roll of
blankets alongside eome machinery which
was not in use. He was in a disheveled
ccrdition and had every appearance of
having been under the Influence of drugs.
Julius Trelloeher, a manufacturing fur
rier. In whose factory Webb was found,
said to-day that Webb had aided him in a
legal contest over a patent.
"Webb did not want to return home and
I let him sleep in the factory," added
Trelloeher.

GUTHRIE, O. T.. Sept. 24.â Attorneys
D. T. Morgan and H. W. Fogrg have car
ried an appeal to Secretary Hitchcock in
reapplicatlon cf the plaintiff to enter a
section of land In which 250 homesteaders
are interested and about 100,000 acres of
the Kickapoo reservation Is Involved. The
facts are, briefly:
On June 2. 1894. D. A. Harvey was made
agent of the board fcr leasing school
lands to select 100,003 acres of the surplus
lands In the Kickapoo reservation as in
demnity school lands. He made the se
lection prior to the opening of the lands
for settlement at noon on May 23. 1S05.
However, at nocn practically all the
lands selected by Harvey were settled
upon and claimed by homesteaders un
der the homestead law.
The applications of the homesteaders
were rejected by the United States land
office for being in conflict with the se
lection made for Indemnity school Jands.
As this is a test case it is being vigor
ouslj* contested by both sides.
Titles of Homesteaders to Lands in
the Kickapoo Reservation Are
Involved.
SECKETABY HITCHCOCK
TO PASS ON THE APPEAL
When subject to only a small tax asset
currency will be taken out by the banks In
normal times to secure the profits incident to
Its issue. It will still further increase the
burden resting upon existing cash reserves.
In times of panic It will be an added burden
on the banks and intensify rather than allevi
ate panic conditions. Secretary Shaw's plan,
however, for a 3 or 0 per cent restrictive tax
upon such Issues will prevent their present
issuance, since they cannot be profltibly issued
unCer that rate of taxation unless Interest
rates are at the high point which they only
reach at times of panic or financial disturb
ance As other forms of banking credit are
then in process of liquidation with resulting
high Interest rates, these notes on then be
issued and will be a great relief in doing the
Â¦work formerly done by the liquidated credits.
Such a process will not, therefor**, be one of
inflation since the notes at such si time will
operate tr> sustain the level of banking credits
ar.d not to raise It.
Thanks to the law of March 14. 1900. the
nation has bullded up the gold foundation of
the governmental currency issues anJ our cur
rency system is pound. As gold in the treas
ury is to the credit of the greenbacks, so
ore the cash reserves r.f banks to ths credit
of their liabilities. â¢ While at present thesj
cash reserves are sufficient to puftuin these
liabilities yet so long as these liabilities re
main at their present amount we want no
Wser.lng of the carh and no adding to the
liabilities.
It is a matter of common knowledge and
the aggregate statements of the national bank
ing system published by the Comptr slier show
that the aggregated liabilities of the system
are at present in a well-expanded condition;
in other words, these liabilities, taken in the
segregate, bear at present suc'a a ratio to the
actual <-c-fh reserves that to lncrÂ«*a.se them
much more would result In a daneerous in
adequacy In the proportion borne by the cash
reserves to liabilities. Now. In this expanded
condition of banking credits, and with a well
condition of general credits other
than banking creditsâ at a period when the
financial history of this country and every
other would indicate that we should be prepar
es methods for facilitating the future liqui
dation of credits rather than methods for
creating additional present credits, we hear
the advocates of lightly taxm) a.-w. currency
i-almlj' advocatina as a bulwark of safety to
banking and business interests of the coun
try the granting cf an authority to the banks
to still further Increase the disproportion be
tween thflr labilities and their cash reserves
fcy the issuance of these notes. It is a prin
ciple of sound finance, as it is of sound
architecture, that whrn a high structure seems
a little unstable the situation is ore demand
ing masonry in the cellar rather than paint
en the roof.
As hae been aUv pointed out by Professor
Cleveland of the University of Pennsylvania,
their- mistake hac been In misunderstanding
the tflJTerence in the nature, method and his
tory of the grof-th of the American system
of independent bor.ks and that of the con
tlnentai system, and In attemptlnc to devise
plans for grafuns on our differentiated â¢pys
tem methods of ls-Â«ue which arÂ« the result
of centuries of evolution in systems of as
sociated and centralized banking:. Their plan
for the authorization of lightly tajcrd national
bank notes unsecured by Government bonds.
If adopted at this time, would probably pre
cipitate an early and most calamitous crisis
in the business of the "-nation.

The adfiress of Secretary Shaw at Chicago
in favor of the autbortratira of a small issue
of heavily taxed bank notes unsecured by the
deposit of the United 6ta~.es bonds required
under the present law indicates the new phase

Honduras and Nicaragua are bristling for war again

President Castro of Venezuela certainly has the

of cheap blackguardism, but it has called Castro again
to the notice of the world as the "bad man par ex

suppressed in Macedonia. It should not be sup
posed, however, that because Servian army officers
have proved themselves adepts in murder they are in
any way proficient in the brutalities of war.

go on blindly struggling with adversity, while Mr.
Â¦ * - Â¦ Â¦ â¢
IF Mr. Chamberlain leave the British Cabinet he
will add to his spectacular record its most painted
feature. His entry into public life as Mayor of
Birmingham was accompanied by a show of red fire,
and ever since he has been mindful of time and pose
in selecting the surprises he has given the British
public. His desertion of Gladstone and the Liberals
to make his political bed with the Tories was the
wonder of the empire; but let it be admitted that he
proved himself something more than a turncoat and
political ' jump-jim-crow, and brought to the Tories
their most vigorous and masterful intellect. He alone
made the South African war, faced its perils, excused
its enormities, softened the burden of its cost and
deftly the price of peace which his country
men must pay. Grant the charge of his enemies that
his suoerb activities have wrought for evil, they
were superb, and perhaps in the long run the peo
ple forgive the evil.
His accession to the Tories put new marrow into
their bones and new blood in their veins, but it also
tempted and led them into enterprises which, have in
creased the debt and decreased the trade of the em
pire. So the sad results of his own policy furnished
him the opportunity for another remarkable turn in
his political career, and he proposed to meet the
increased debt and to stay the decline in trade by a
sudden reversal of England's time-honored policy of
free > trade and an immediate plunge into protection.
Balfour tried to dance to the new tune, but failed to
catch the step,: and immediately Mr. Chamberlain
took offense, a long premeditated offense, and an
nounced his intention to leave the Cabinet and of
course the party. Â«

"What is Clairvoyance?" is the subject
chosen for Dr. Alexander J. Mclvor-Tyn
dall's psychological lecture at Steinway
Hall Sunday evening. The Interest In
these subjects, as propounded by the fa

large audiences gather at Steinway Hall.
Clairvoyance is a subject that Is little un
derstood and One that has never been
given a logical, scientific explanation.
That there is a peculiar psychic, faculty
that can see into the unknown is some
thing that seems to bo warranted by
facts, although there are many who claim
that all so-called spiritualistic phenomena
can be elucidated on strictly, materialistic
lines. The truth regarding this myste
rious subject will be fully exemplified at
the lecture Sunday night by Dr. Mclvor-
Tyndall. The lecture will be illustrated
by demonstrations and experiments in the
powers of the Invisible forces.

Fire almost completely gutted the inte
rior of four flats at 2035, 2037, 2033 and 2041
Pine street yesterday afternoon and did
considerable damage to the two buildings,
especially in the interior. The building
at 2035-37 Pine street iÂ» owned by Austin
McNamara, an umbrella dealer at 7 Bat
tery street, who resided In one of the
flats. Alex Mann, a. flower dealer on Polk
street, owned the building at 203SM1 and
occupied the top flat. The other flats
were occupied by T. G. Elliot, a lawyer,
and A. M. Allardyce, an employe of the
telephone company.
The fire started In the area between the
two buildings and is supposed to have
been caused by children playing with
matches. It had attained considerable
headway before an alarm was turned in.
The blaze ate Its way into both houses
and was raging fiercely when the Fire
Department arrived. It was a difficult
fire to handle and an immense amount
of water was poured on it before the
blaze was subdued.
As a consequence the interior furnish
ings of all the flats were practically ruin
ed. The damage to the buildings them
selves probably will not amount to more
than $1JOO, which Is fully covered by In
surance. The furnishings were uninsured
and will be practically a total loss. They
were worth about $5000. T,.v"V'
The occupants of the flats were forced
to flee without saving anything further
than their money and jewelry, so rapidly
did the flames spread. Mrs. Allardyce
ran out leaving behind her a large sum
of money and some valuable jewelry In
the dresser. These were recovered in
tact after the flre, although the dressir
containing them was badly scorched.

This attack on 39,000 school children in New
York, and the refusal of the milk teamsters in Chi
cago to make more than one delivery of milk per
<lay. resulting in the death of thousands of children
who would be alive if there had been two deliveries,
are examples of labor union policy that may well
disquiet the whole country. The beasts that perish
have regard for their young, and what must be said
of men who in pursuit of any purpose whatever con
demn their own children to ignorance and death!
If union labor is to be justified it is evident that
:t must change its oaths and y its management and
come to realize its responsibility as part of the com
munity, sharing the responsibility for the thyigs es
sential to community life/ An oath that puts the
authority of the walking delegate above law and re
ligion, and these evidences of slavish obedience to
that oath, even to the injury of the families of the
m*n who obey it, is an obligation imposed upon men
for the destruction of all government, and is the
essence of anarchy.
Surely it is the most serious disregard of the
wholesome conditions of community life that brings
about such a situation as that in New York. It is
an attack by the walking delegates upon the rights
of nearly 40,000 children, who cannot defend them
selves. The alarming feature of it is that the unitm
labor which turns those children out of school knows
no other reason for the strike that did it than that it
was ordered by the walking delegates. One may well
be led to question the quality of citizenship of men
who, without knowing why, consent to turn their
own children out of school and into the street be
cause they were ordered to do so by a walking dele
gate, who gives no reason for his autocratic use of
power. The oath which binds them to obedience to
such an order, with such a result, is one inimical to
the interests of the people and dangerous to the
Government itself.
NEW YORK CITY appropriated money to
furnish adequate school facilities, relieve
overcrowded classrooms and accommodate
Me thousands of children for whom there was no
room at all. The new buildings were put promptly
under construction, and were to have been ready for
occupancy at the beginning of the present school
year. But they are not ready. The building trade
strikes, instigated by the walking delegates Murphy
and Parks, stopped the work, and as a result 72,000
school children are put on half-time and for 3000
there is no room at all, even for a fraction of a day.
This means that 39,000 children in that city of
school age have no provision for their education.
The public schools are peculiarly the academy of the
poor, or of those who have not the means to spare
to give their children educational advantages else
where than in s.uch schools. The well-to-do are in
a measure independent of the common schools, and
when those fail to give adequate advantages they are
able to bestow them in private establishments. But
when the children of the masses are shut out of the
common schools they lose their sole chance for edu-
THE CROWDED SCHOOLS
The Supreme Court declared yesterday
that the work of the Board of Education
of San Francisco could not be done
through deputies'. The question arose in
a suit brought by ex-Superintendent of
Schools Webster against the Directors.
The School Superintendent is ex-officio
a member of the Board of Education.
Webster did not want to attend the de
liberations of the body himself and sent
his deputy, W. I). Klngrsbury, Instead.
The board refused to admit the deputy,
and the superintendent petitioned the Su
perior Court for a writ of mandamus. Tbi
board was sustained and an appeal was
taken to the Supreme Court.
The last named tribunal holds that the
Superintendent of Schools may have depu
ties, but that no member of the Board of
Education can be provided for likewise. It
is declared that Webster, as Superinten
dent of Schools and as ex-officio member
of the Board of Education, held two dis
tinct and wholly separate positions.

It is to be borne in mind of course that the question
of the wage rate affects the manning and operation of
a ship as well as that of building one. The American
seaman gets better fare, better pay and better ac
commodations of all kinds than the foreign seaman.
It is right that he should do so, for the American
people do not expect sailors any more than other
classes of American workers to compete in cheap
ness with underpaid foreigners. Protection to the
American merchant marine is therefore an imperative
issue of the day, and the people have a right to de
mand it of Congress at the cdming session.
ONE of the gratifying features of the political
outlook is the cordial indorsement given to
the demand for legislation in favor of the
American merchant marine by Republican conven
tions in every State where State conventions have
been held this year. Even in Nebraska, where the
people have been supposed to be more or less in
different to ocean shipping interests, the declarations
of the party have been notably direct and strong,
and it is thus made evident that the grain-growers of
the State have a clear conception of the importance
of having an efficient merchant fleet upon the ocean
to carry their surplus grain to foreign markets.
The Democrats' of Ohio adopted a long platform
dealing mainly with State issues, but They did not fail
to note the growing demand for an enlarged mer
chant marine, and with their customary obstinacy
they proceeded to denounce and condemn it. The
issue therefore becomes in that State a partisan one,
though it .should not be so, for a merchant marine
serves equally all the interests of the people, and
Democratic as well as Republican farmers, merchants
and workingmen profit by it. Still, having been com
mitted to a support of free trade, the party doubtless
feels itself bound, for consistency's 6ake, to oppose
any sort of legislation that tends to protect and ad
vance any American industry, whether on land or
.The issue is an old one, and the public is familiar
with the arguments which sustain the cause of those
who advocate the adoption of an efficient system of
protecting our ocean going merchant service. It is
known that one of the main causes of our inability
to compete with foreign shipping is the difference
between the rate of wages that prevail here and that
which obtains }n European shipyards. Many sta
tistics have been published from time to time showing
by. official figures that even were the European lines
unsubsidized they would still have an advantage over
us by reason of low wages. The opponents of an
American merchant marine have sometimes denied
the validity of such statistics when they could j no
longer evade them, and it is therefore worth while
to direct attention to a new testimony on the sub
ject.
There recently appeared in the London Times an
article by "An Ulster Workingman" giving the ex
perience of a fellow workman with respect to wages
in Great Britain and the United States. In the
course of his letter he says:
A fellow workman and I were in receipt of 30 shill
ings per week each some time ago. My fellow work
man decided that he would abandon his country and the
flag and to goto a country that-would do better for
him, so he went to the United States and received CO
shillings per week right oft. When he was in this
j country, at the wage of 30 shillings weekly, his expedi
ture was 27 shillings.* which left 3 shillings of a margin:
now, while his wages have Increased by double the
amount he received when in this country, he assures me
that his expenditure has increased by only one-third,
thus:
In this country his re- In the United States of
celpts were 30s weekly. 30s America his receipts
His expenditure was, are, weekly 60s
weekly 27s His expenditure Is,,
â weekly 36s
Margin of saving â
power weekly 3s His margin of saving
I power, weekly.'. 24s
Or, in other words, for every shilling he used to save
in this country, he can now save eight shillings In the
States, besides having better educational facilities pro
vided for his children.
. â¢ That is the story of the personal experience of a
workingman in shipyards of the two countries. It
contains by implication a story of the cause of the
failure of the United States to hold her own as a
ship-building country in competition with Great Brit
ain. In this country we have sought to establish
an industrial system which will permit the worker
to have a considerable margin of profit over and
above expenses when maintaining a comfortable
standard of living. In Great Britain under the free
trade system the aim is to reduce wages as low as
possible so as to be able to build ships more cheaply
than any other nation. We cannot and we ought not
to try to compete with the British in that respect, and
accordingly we must either abandon all expectation
of having a merchant marine on the deep seas equal
to our needs, or we must give to our ship-builders
and our ship-owners a protection equal to that given
to American industries on land.
OUR MERCHANT MARINE.

The people of Denver, by an overwhelming major
ity, have refused to adopt a city charter which was
submitted to their consideration. Somebody must
have informed them thorqughly of our experience
and they took advantage of our predicament. It is
always well to know that our neighbors profit by our
example, even if it is unfortunate.
The groom-to-be, unlike the fair bride,
is comparatively unknown to San Fran
ciscans. He is said to be a handsome
fellow* and a good soldier. He is in line
for promotion, which, in the ordinary
course of events, should occur within a
year. Â¦'Â¦--'-'Â¦.':
The wedding of Miss Elizabeth Young,
daughter of \ Lieutenant General Samuel
B. M. Young, to Lieutenant Henney of
Fort Crook, Neb., will take place on Oc
tober 7 at St. Elizabeth's Chapel. Wash
ington. A small reception will follow at
his father's residence, 22 Jackson street,
to which many California friends have
been bidden.
Mr. Payot has given liberally .of his
store of knowledge of the Old World, and
interest in his talks is augmented by the
fine views in his possession of every
building and site of note.
Several delightful numbers were given
by friends of the club- and a trip through
Romeâ on canvasâ was the event of the
afternoon. Henry Payot was the cice
rone, who in charming manner carried
the ladies through the palaces, ruins and
libraries of the ancient city and through
the Vatican.
â¢ The Forum Club had a delightful ses
sion on Wednesday afternoon, Mrs. Hen
ry Payot presiding. ' .
Wit and humor, by the club members; so

arranged by Miss Ella P. McCloskey.
Six members told the very best stories
they knew, created or borrowedâ in any
case they were well told. In this phase
of development women are again en
croaching upon man's domain.
The solos were delightfully rendered,
as were the readings by Miss Kelleher.
The address by Mr. McNaught'was quite
the event of the day. To be sure, he said
he believed clubs to be good institutions;
that they were powerful aids to devel
opment, and many other nice things, but
no man would have had the hardlhood # to
say otherwise.' But the ladles were con
vinced of the sincerity of his declara
tions and voted the talk the very best
they had listened to by a "non-eligible"
for a long time.
The next meeting of the club will be
for members only.
The Papyrus Club entertained yester
day In Utopia Hall and as Is usual with
this coterie of clever women offered a
programme that reflected the breezy per
sonality of the club. About 100 members
and guests gathered to listen to a few
clever stories that are always on tap, to
hear the sweet voice of Madame Semin
ario and, among other things, to hear,
what Mr. John McNaught had to say
about "Woman's Clubs."
The programme as rendered was as fol
lows:
The library trustees will therefore have
an additional sum of $17,700, which they
rr.ay put to any use they may de3lre.
Some of the money will be used for the
purchase of books. The trustees askeJ
for $69,428 last June and aa they received
but.JS3.30O were compelled to largely re
duce the item of $10,OCO for the purchase
of books. They will also be in a posttion
to furnish the new branch library on
Sixteenth street with additional funds.
The raise cf 30 per cent on the assessed
valuation of this city and county by the
Â«tate Board of Equalization will result
In increasing the appropriation for the
Public Library by exactly $17,700.
When the Beard of Supervisors reduced
the municipal tax rate from J1.078 to 84.4
cents in order to provide the exact reve
nue contemplated in- the budget, it did
not change the rate allowed the Public
Library, because the charter specifically
provides what that rate must be.
The charter provides that the Supervis
ors shall annually levy a tax for the
support of the Public Library which sha.l
not be less than 14 cents nor more than
t% cents on every $100 of assessed valua-
In' fixing the levy last June, the Board
of Supervisors adopted the minimum rate
of 1% cents for the library- This rate on
a toial assessed valuation of H22.000.0W
would produce the sum of $63,300. Whoa
the lower tax levy was adopted last Mon
day the Board of Supervisors was obliged
to reaffirm the minimum rate of Ha
cents previously adopted. Calculating thL-.
rate on a total assessment of $540,000,000.
which Includes the 30 per cent raise made
by the State Board vt Equalization, will
give an aprcpriatlon of $S1.000 for the Pub
lic Library.
The almost universal feeling of loyalty in the party
ranks, as manifested among the delegates to the con
vention in all the proceedings from first to last,
serves to bring out with starting clearness the one
exception that prevented the vote for candidate for
the Mayoralty from being absolutely instead of al
most unanimous. The accidents of politics placed in
the convention as chairman of the delegation from
the Forty-fifth Assembly District a man who, while
holding a place in the councils of the Republican
League and representing the Republicans of his dis
trict, is yet serving an opposition candidate. That
man, for reasons which he described as "personal."
declined to vote for the nomination of Mr. Crocker
although there was no opposition candidate. His
action of course foreshadows a further betrayal of
the party during the campaign, for after refusing to
vote for the party candidate in the convention it is
hardly likely the double-dealing delegate from the
Forty-fifth will support him before the people or
vote for him on election day.
The appearance of a single intriguer of this kind in
the convention is, however, of little moment to the
party or to the. city. He managed indeed to mar the
harmony of the convention, but his power Jor evil
goes little further. Whatever clique is behind him is
evidently small, for he could not bring a single man
even of his own delegation to assist him in his oppo
sition to the nominee for Mayor. The incident may
therefore be dismissed for the present, but every Re
publican should bear it in mind when next the un
reliable gentleman solicits a place in Republican
councils or election to a Republican convention.
That issue aside, the people of the city, without re
spect to party, can review the proceedings of the
convention with satisfaction and study the platform
and the ticket with no little gratification. The party
is pledged at once to economy and to progress, The
declarations concerning the work of municipal im
provements are all that can be desired, and will have
the support of the intelligence of. the people:
The ticket speaks for itself. It is exceptionally
excellent in every particular. Some of the nominees
have been tried in office and have proven themselves
faithful, sagacious and efficient The record made
by them is one of the best guarantees of the ability
of the Republican party to give the city not only an
honest but a capable, progressive and economical
administration. All the candidates are men of high
standing in the community and are representative of
our best citizenship. Each and every one of. them
merits the support of the people, irrespective of
party. Their election would mean an era of muni
cipal government marked by a genuine devotion to
the public welfare. In fact, the time has come to
have an improved San Francisco, and the Republican
party has nominated men upon whom the citizens
can safely place the responsibility of carrying out the
improvements. To their support all independent
voters should rally. Let us have an administration
in thorough accord with the popular aspiration for
harmony, progress and economy.
WITH a good ticket, a good platform and
a degree of harmony in the party that as
sures loyal support to every candidate, the
Republicans of San Francisco* enter the municipal
campaign with every prospect of a sweeping victory
all along the line. From the time of the primaries
down to the close of the Convention every step taken
by the party has been in the direction of good gov
ernment and honest politics. The opposing parties
will find it difficult to discover a single point in the
platform or a single candidate on the ticket upon
which to center their attacks, while every Republican
and every conscientious independent voter will find
many self-evident reasons why the whole ticket
should be supported and elected from top to bottom.
Rarely has the Republican party in San Francisco
been so united and infused with such a spirit of
harmony on the eve of a municipal election as in this
instance. While the opposition parties are torn by
dissensions there is in the Republican camp a well
nigh unanimous sentiment of loyalty to the plat
form and to the ticket. That fact in itself should be
sufficient to incline independent voters to the Re
publican side in the contest, for it is certain that
neither of the other parties could give the city a
well ordered government. Should cither of them by
any possibility succeed in electing its candidates, the
result would be a period of bitter partisan and
factional struggles for office and for the spoils.
On the other hand, the harmony which prevailed in
the Republican convention and which prevails equally
among the rank and file is in itself an evidence of the
fitness of the party to administer the affairs of the
city with businesslike efficiency and assured success.

The Only Thing That
Interests Everybody
DID you ever stop to realize what it is in life that really interests
you the mostâ outside of eating, sleeping and being merry, of
course? Is it the mock heroics, the polished gentility of a dead
and gone age, or isn't it life itself â tense, eager, pulsating life â the very
things that the other fellow does that you do yourself? Just take note
of the following:
"The job of front-end brakeman on a mountain division is no great
stake for a man ordinarily, but it was one for me just then. We knew
when we went into the superintendent's office that somebody was to tcet
fired; the only question was who â the train crew or the operator? Our
engine crew were out of it; it was up to the conductor and to me. -Had
the operator displayed red signals? The conductor said no. I said no.
the operator said yes. but he lied. We couldn't prove it; we could only
put our word against his: and, what made it the worse for me. my con-
ductor was something of a liar himself.
1 "I stood beading in a cold sweat, for I could see with half an eye
it was going against us. The superintendent, an up and up railroad man
every inch and all business, but suspicious, was leaning the operator's
way the strongest kind.
"There wasn't another soul in the little room as the three o{ us
stood before the superintendent's- desk."
There's a situation which at first blush might seem ordinary enough
butâ is it? Perhaps you've been in the same fix yourself. It is not new'
but it always will be to the man who has the experience for the first
time, and oh. what awful possibilities it portends. It is a situation Â¦ that
every man who works constantly stands in awe of. Can you cucss how
it came out?Â» No. But you want to know. Of course you want to
' know. That is the curiosityâ sympathyâ or what you will that makes
the lives of those about us-^-the real flesh and blood men and women we
all knowâ the most absorbing subject imaginable. You may deny this
if you will, but there is not the shadow of a doubt that yov will look
first for Frank H. Spearman's thrilling two-page narrative of 'The
Trainmaster's Story" in the next Sunday Call. It is the second in this
remarkable series.
Of course you're reading "Lees and Leaven," by E. W Townsend
the famous author of "Chimmie Fadden," which is nothing short of a

The ordinary Chinese laborer is a very
unskillful liar "unless carefully coached
by a white attorney or a shrewd Mon
golian In the coolie importing ring. Choo
Hing proved this to the satisfaction of
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock" yesterday and because of the skepti
cism of the Judge Choo will chew his
rice henceforth In China.
Choo arrived recently on a vessel from
the Alaska salmon canneries and was ar
rested for not being provided with a cer
tificate of registration. He swore before
Sudge Heacock on September 15 that he
was a native of China, and at the time
of the operation of Chinese registration
under the exclusion act that he was at
work chopping down trees in Montana
near the town of Missoula. He said that
his employer refused to grant him leave
of absence for the purpose of getting reg
istered and that he therefore failed to
comply with the act.
On his re-examination yesterday Choo
swore that he was born In the Globe Ho
tel In this city, and that at. the time the
registration was being made he was In
China.
"Didn't you swear yesterday that you
weie in Montana, chopping wood?" asked
the Judge.
"No; that was a mistake of the inter
preter. I said that I was living In the
village of Chop Wood in China," answered
the Mongolian Ananias.
Choo introduced a Chinese friend -who
swore that he saw Choo in the village
of Chop Wood.
Interpreter Jones Informed the court
that there was no village of that name

Choo was ordered deDorted.
The grand officers and nearly 400 past
masters of the Ancient Order of United
Workmen yesterday assembled in Stein
way Hall, where the Grand Lodge of
California wag in session for the pur
pose of taking action on the plan adopted
by the Supreme Lodge of the order at its
recently held session.
The meeting was presided over altern
ately by Grand Master F. W. Browning
and Past SiiDreme Master W. H. Jor
dan. After a statement of the purpose
of tloe special session the representatives
to the grand body went into committee
of the whole and the greater portion of
the forenoon and the afternoon session
was taken up by Past Supreme Master
Workman W. Warner Wilson. He made
a detailed explanation of the reason why
the supreme body had adopted the plan
of assessments which raises in a small
amount in the ages under 53 years, and
raises the assessment on a $2000 policy
at the age of 55 from %3 56, the present
rate, to $8 40 a month. He stated that
the beneficial committee had made a full
report, which showed clearly that the
rate charged for those over 55 years was
not sufficient to meet the obligations ac
cruing in the older ages and that the
rate fixed is that which is necessary to
conduct the business on safe lines. Ho
then explained a number of options of
fered by the supreme body by which
those who cannot pay the high rate
charged may take either option at a low
er rate with a corresponding: reduction
of the face value of the beneficiary cer
tificate.
The speaker was asked many questions,
to all of which he gave an answar.
Past Grand Master J. N. Younar spoke
at some lensrt* on what he considered
the want of equity of the Supreme Lodge
plan, and urged that the representatives
from this State to the next supreme ses
sion urge the adoption of some method
that would be mow iuÂ»t to the older
members who have been In the order for
a quarter of a century.
At half past 4 o'clock the committee
rose and reported progress, after which
an adjournment was taken until 10 o'clock
this morning.

HIS FRIEND IN TROUBLE.
Judge Heacock remarked that it had
been his custom always to accede to the
request of the District Attorney In the
matter of bail, because the attorney was
acquainted with all the facts of the case,
and he was not. He would therefore re
quire a bond in the sum of $5000, and set
the preliminary examination for October
20 at 10 o'clock.
In the afternoon Horn was taken into
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock's office for identification and for the
purpose of having his bail set. The pris
oner's interests were cared for by repre
sentatives of Judge Dibble and Bert
Schlesinger. his attorneys. They expected
that the amount of bail required would
not exceed that in the cases of Jailers
Dasha, Burnett and Dempsey, who had
been released on bondg of. $2000 each, and
stated their willingness to furnish se
curity fnr that sum. But Mr. Woodwerth
stated to the court that after a confer
ence with Mr. Burns and other officials
he had. decided to ask that the bonds be
fixed at not less than $5000. He said fur
ther that the Government regarded Horn
Toon as one of the principal offenders In
the substitution cases and expected to
convict him.

When the orowd became the thickest In

placed him under arrest for complicity
in the substitution trick. No sooner had
the news reached Chinatown that Horn
had been taken than his Chinese sure
ties appeared and surrendered him Into
the custody of the Police Judge. An or
der was at once made by Judge Cabaniss
transferring the prisoner to the custody
of the Federal authorities and he was
at once surrendered to United States Mar
shal John H. Shine. The Marshal, to
gether with Messrs. Burns and Wood

and subjected him to the "sweating" pro
cess for about two hours, and, although
the wily Chinese refused to make a con
fession, they succeeded in extracting sev

De L.uca claimed that Ingalls without
any provocation whatever pulled a re
volver out of his pocket when he entered
the stor-e and, pointing the weapon at
his head, said: "Vou are under arrest
and if you make any resistance you
know what will happen." De Luca said
he never thought of resisting arrest and
the conduct of the Deputy Game Com
missioner amazed him. He threatens to
make it interesting for Ingalls and says
he has several witnesses who will bear
out his statement that the deputy had
no cause whatever to brandish his re
volver.

six Chinese now in custody In place of
six Chinese ordered remanded Into the

mentioned by Gamble. Each had three
old Chinamen concealed In the Appraiser's

September 11, when Gamble arrived at
the building after having released the six
remanded men. Horn Toon and Wong Din
disappeared from sight as soon as they
learned that the six substituted Chinese
had been taken ashore oft the steamer

Erwin to Appear Before
Court Commissioner
To-Day.
To-day James W. Ervin, formerly as
sistant superintendent of the San Fran
dscb special delivery system, will ap
jjear before I'nited States Court Commis
sioner E. H. Heacock t > answer the Indict
ment brought against him l>> the Federal
Grand Jury of tl^e District of Columbia,
which charges Mm with conspiring to dc-
Iraud the United States Government.
L'pon thr aJI'-.CKtioiis in the certified copy
of the indictment now in the hands of
United State* District Attorney Marshall
Woodworth bia preliminary examination
will take place.
Bruin's attorney. Samuel Knight, has
announced that be will make a fig^t to
have Ji'P client's case settied here with
out tiif necessity of a trial la Washing
ton. To d.> this Knight will have to
l>r!np forth such a weight of testimony
i!-at Corrmissiont-r He acock will feel jus
t::i^<i in declaring that the allegations in
the indictment sent out by the Washing
ton Grand Jury are not warranted by the
lacts. in which case he will appeal to the
committing magistrate. Judge de Haven,
to refuse gn order of removal of the pris
oner to the District of Columbia court.
Should this happen. Erwln will be a free
man the minute Judge de Haven hands
down his decision.
Knight's determination to fight his cll
ent's case and secure his acquittal here In
San Francisco may suffer a disappoint
ment. In that already the same tactics
have been tried by the attorney of George
W. Beavers, also under indictment in
New York, and there failed. District At
torney Wood wortn 1 feels that the commit
ting magistrate here will follow the prec
edent pet by the New York Judge.
In the absence of Superintendent D. S.
Kichardson, the chief testimony which
will be brought against Erwin will be the
story which was told by the absent of
ficial before the Grand Jury at Washing
ton. His testimony has been forwarded
to Attorney Woodworth and will be prac
tically the only grounds upon which the
Government can base its case, either here
or in Washington. Attorney Knight feels
that he has. enough testimony right here
to refute the allegations of that instru
ment.
Meanwhile Superintendent Richardson
conspicuous by his absence. His
'attorney. R. H. Eepey, says that he has
not yet left Washington and that no time
is f-et for his return. Postmaster SJin
tajrue seems to be entirely at sea as to the
date when his superintendent can be ex
pected to resume his business at the local
office and his place Is being filled by sub
vrdirates.
Supervisor Braunhart, Father Carraher
and a number of others made short ad
dresses, declaring for the entire bond is
sue.
He dwelt upon necessity for co-opera
tion, demonstrating by actual figures that
no one section of the city can carry a
sinple provision without the aid of the
other sections.
George Renner, president of the Dray
men's Association, made a forcible ad
dress favoring all the projects included
in the bond issue, xie said that when the
announcement of the bond issue was first
made the Draymen's Association met and
decided to wage a campaign for better
streets and servers. Later they came to
the conclusion that it would be selfish
and foolish to fight only for a portion of
the projects, so the association Indorsed
Every one cf the provisions and its mem
bers are now working for the passage of
the entire bond issue.
He favored all the proposed amend
ments, he said, because each one of them
was intended for the permanent better
ment of the city. He realized, he said,
that persons In certain sections of the
city were more interested in some projects
than in others that did not directly ap
peal to them. He said he knew this feel
ing- existed, but it was necessary if they
wished to carry any single one of the pro
visions to secure the co-operation of those
In other parts of the city. .Therefore it
would be necessary for every man inter
ested in any of the projects mentioned
in the bond Issue to work earnestly for
every provision In order that in return
for these services his own' pet project
would receive the support of those he
hv'lpeil.
He pointed out the need for more
sewers, better streets and improved
schoclhouses and made special pleas for
Telegraph Hill and St. Mary"s Square
parks. Of the latter he said that Its
establishment would serve to wipe out
one of the worst plague spots In the city
and in place of a breeding place for vice
would furnish a beautiful and healthful
breathing place for pure children.
An enthusiastic maFSÂ»-mecting. under the
auspices of the North End Protective
League, was held lsst night in Washing
ton Square Hall for the purpose of for
warding interest in favor of issuing bonds
for the s-pecifitd public improvements.

Most hair preparations are merely scalp

dandruff is a germ disease there has been
only one preparation put on the market
that will actually destroy the dandruff

PITTSBURG, Sept. 24.â Believing that
the Boston American League baseball
team will not play the post season series
with Pittsburg, Manager McGraw of the

of that club. McGraw thinks that by
winning from Pittsburg to-day New York
will ln all likelihood land in second place,
in which event he would like to play
Pittsburg five post season games to see
which is really the. superior team. -His
club has nine post season fames arranged
for, but would cancel all for Pittsburg.
He proposes that the proceeds go to the
players of the two clubs.
MILWAUKEE, Sept. 24.â Henry K1I

Boston and the Pittsburgh team of the
National League.
BOSTON. Sept. 24.â Notwithstanding
that Mr. Killiea has wired his rejection
of the terms on which the members of
the Boston American League baseball
team proposed playing a series with the
Pittsburg National League team. It was
said to-nlsht that there was still a pos
sibility of the series being played. The
players' proposition was to consider the
owner as a member of the team on a
pro rata basis. He refused to consider
anything but a flat one-half, as he owns
the team and gives free use of his park.

came home In 2:05.
He will go again- to-morrow. Summary:
The officials were: Judgesâ W. M. Cart
wright. Stewart Carter; refereeâ E. M.
Graney; announcerâ Frank Thompson;
timekeeper â F. R. Butz.
Billy Fuller and James LinJger sup
plied the comedy element of the evening.
They boxed four long distance rounds
without either being damaged.
Referee Graney stopped the bout be
tween George Flnnegr.n and Frank Scott
In the first round. Scott went down sev
eral times without being hit.
As a curtain raiser Jiramy Britt and
Sam Bergcr boxed three rounds. Tha
first two rounds showed some clever
boxing. The third was an Imitation of a.
knockout. It was sufficiently realistic to
draw rounds of applause from the spec
tators.
In the first and second rounds there was
but little damage done. In the third
Hughes landed some hard right hand
swings to the head and had Leonard In
distress. It was all fighting In the last
round, Leonard apparently landing thÂ«
most tellinjr blows.
The Judges disagreed and Referee Gra
ney decided In favor of Hughes. Tho
spectators seemed about as evenly divided
In their opinions as were the Judges. Had
Leonard assumed the aggressive from tho
start he would have surely w,on.
George Murray outclassed Bin Johnson.
He finally knocked the latter out In the
third round. Johnson was standing up
leaning on the ropes at the time and re
mained in that posture until assisted to
his corner by his seconds.
Harry Tenney and Joe Kane,' an oddly
matched 'pair In size, fought themselves
to a standstill in two rounds. First ons
and then the other had the advantage un
til Just before the gong sounded the end
of the fourth round. Jenney had Kana
in distress and finally knocked him out.
It was some time before he came to.
. Dick Hyland. the Sharkey of the ama
teur ring, wore out Ed Anstett In four
rounds and secured the decision. Hyland
was the stronger and the more aggresslva
throughout.
W. J. Leonard, the Olympic Club's fa
vorite boxer, was defeated last night,
much to his surprise and to that of tha
spectators. He met Jack Hughes of the
Hawthorne Atheltic Club In a bout at the
Olympic Club's special boxing exhibition.

Pabst doubled and Krug did likewise In
the ninth, saving the home team from a
complete blank. The score:
The second round produced a pair for
the Senators. Sheehan landed on the ball
for two sacks. Lynch allowed It to go
between his legs, so Sheehan took an
extra one. Doyle came through with an
other and It brought Sheehan in. Doyle
went to third on an out and Knell's long
fly and Zearfoss' error let him score.
The fourth was good for another two
for Fisher. Sheehan hit safely again and
Hogan accepted a pass. Knell lined one
to Pabst and the throw he made to sec
ond was late. This filled the bags and a
hit by Casey through the lnfleld brought
two over the pan. In the ninth a double
by Townsend, a pass to Eagan and Shee
han'a third wallop brought the last two
over.
Herr did not have anything and he was
a dream for the Senators If perchance
they needed runs. The plate was hard to
find. He could not locate It If he tried
for a month. They should have beaten
him worse, but they were indeed charit
able to let him down with six.
Sacramento played pretty good baseball
behind the veteran, while San Francisco
was much to the bad on fielding and in
running about the cushions. In one
inning th<? home team had a chance to
collect a few runs/' but Mr. Lynch made
a brilliant attempt to steal home on a
short fly to Eagan. He left ahead of the
ball at that, so the umpire promptly
called him out for It, and that chance
was cast aside.
The venerable Phil Knell is still In the
going. They can't stop him for a minute.
He had the home team completely under
the spell of his deliberate, southern de
livery yesterday afternoon at Recreation
Park and the best they got was a run and
five scattered hits. They did not make
that one till the ninth, when the old boy
eased up for Just a moment. Score, 6 to 1.

bay colt Highball by Ben Stroxne-
Strychlnla as the favorite In the winter
books.
Highball is pronounced the greatest
two-year-old of the year. His first per
formance of note was . when he won the
Grand Union Hotel stakes, worth $10,000,
at Saratoga. His next win, In the Plat
bush stakes, when he gave away weight
to the supposed best of the year, and
beat them easily, stamped him as the sea
son's champion. Since that he has main
tained his pride of place against all com
ers by winning the valuable Junior Cham
pion at Gravesend. He was bred at the
Dlxlana farm, Kentucky, by Major Car
son, and was purchased as a yearling by
W. M. Scheftel of the New York Stock
Exchange. He Is trained by Bud May,
who formerly raced horses In partnership
with his father, W. H. May.
Highball will not be started again this
year, but will be taken to the Memphis
track, where the horses In his stable will
be wintered. Next spring, If he Is ready,
he will be started In the East in whatever
events it appears he might win. Those
engagements which precede the American
Derby will be treated, as matters of minor
importance. His first real trial of next
year will be In. the big race at Chicago.

CHICAGO. Sept. 24.â Weight and a
weak ride beat Hargis out of the handi
cap at Hawthorne to-day and the $600
purse went to S. C. Hlldreth's By Ways.
By Ways and Hargis closed equal favor
ites at 9 to S. the latter backed from 2 to
1. Down the backstretch Wilson moved
up with By Ways and, turning Into the
stretch, she led Dutch Carter by a
length. Hargis skinned the rail at thi3
point and saved much ground. ReJff tried
to go through on the inside, but could
not make It and was thus forced to pull
up and take the outside. This lost him
considerable ground and his. weight. 111
pounds, prevented him getting up, al
though he was beaten only a neck.
The track was about as good as it will
get this season and the mile and an
eighth was run In 1:53, one of the fastest
races of the meeting.
The weather was clear and cool; the at

An investigation has been made by De
tectives Freel and Armstrong of the cir
cumstances surrounding the Injuries re
ceived by H. Holmes of 1661 Octavia
street, who was found In an unconscious
condition in Derby place, a small street
off Mason street, between Geary and
Post, at an early hour yesterday morn
ing. The officers a*ertalned that Holmes
was found by L. Lindon of 413 Mason
street in a semi-conscious condition and
conveyed to the Central Emergency Hos
pital in the ambulance, where an exami
nation by the surgeons developed the fact
that he was suffering from a fractured
skull. From blood stains on the side of
the building alongside of which Holmes
was found, it is supposed that while In
toxicated he fell and struck his head, sus
taining the injury that may prove fatal.
According to the police Holmes often
went on periodical sprees, and the fact
that his watch and 40 cents were ' found
in his pockets dispels the theory at first
entertained that he was the victim of foul
play.

TULARE, Sept. 24.â Five hundred thou
sand dollars to go up in smoke October 1.
That is a tale v soon to-be told. One
dozen years ago the Tulare Irrigation
District issued a half million dollars'
worth of bonds to construct ditches and
buy water rights. Unfortunately a. year
after the district works were completed
the panic year of 1893 came and the peo
ple defaulted on the payment- of the in
terest on their Immense bonded Indebt
edness. Litigation was resorted to ; and
the matter has been tied up In the courts
ever since, and likewise Tulare prosperity
was tied up with that litigation.
A -little more than' six months ago a
movement waB started to compromise the
bonded indebtedness if possible. The al
most Incredible undertaking of only .1200
taxpayers, wiping out a, debt of over
$500,000 on a cash basis was started and
by October 1 will be an accomplished fact.
To-nlght a mass meeting of citizens was
held, at which $10,000 was subscribed I to
buy in .property on which taxes levied
were not paid. . . This subscription '. makes
the settlement an assured fact. The bonds
will be burned. and by the blaze will, be
seen -a future of plenty and prosperity

W\ F. Costello. defendant in the suit
ever the life insurance policies for $14,000
en the life of the late George E. Baron
of the wealthy Baron family, brought by
Mary F. Baron, sister-in-law of the de
ceased and administratrix of his estate,
ftled an answer to the suit yesterday. He
denies that Mrs. Baron has any interest
in the policies, which were assigned to
him by Baron In recognition of his ser
vices. He says further that the suit is
the result of the efforts of Dr. Cornelius
P. Buckley to harass and annoy him
because of his refusal to accept his sug
gestions as to the disposal cf the money
Ehortly after the death of Baron.
The answer Is a revival cf a bitter bat
tle that was commenced two years ago
apainst Costello. At that time he claimed
that Buckley compelled the administra
trix of the Baron estate to have him
haled into court because he refused to
pay $4009 to e certain Mrs. Jacks, a
friend of the deceased. In the document
fl!ed yesterday Costello says that Dr.
Buckley even refused to sign a death cer
tificate Ehowlng the cause of Baron's
death and which would enable him to col
lect the amount due on the policies be
cause of the refusal to pay Mrs. Jacks
the amount of one of the policies. C03
ttllo also claims that Dr. Buckley pre-

PERSONAL MENTION.
As a token of their willingness to have
the students assist in the administration
of their own affairs, the faculty men ex
tended an invitation to the men of the
senior class to- attend all future meetings
of the committee on student affairs when
matters that concern the undergraduate
body are being discussed: A second con
cession was the granting of the use of
the college rooms to" the undergraduates
without a deposit of 125, as heretofore de
manded.
These steps are considered â¢ the most
practical that have yet been taken in the
matter of student self-government and
upon the success of the present plan will
depend its future extension. , . Â¦ Â¦.
- - . â¢'Â»
The decisions reached are destined to
have a very wide Influence upon under
graduate affairs, as they mark the begin
ning of the first attempt to Introduce
"senior control" as an active factor in
university administration. The following
Beniors were present at the conference:
Max Thelen, president of the student
body;. A. L. Price, editor of the Occident;
P. M. Carey, president of the senior class;
J. E. Roadhouse, director of senior sing
ing; Carl Parker, editor of the University
Magazine; W. C. Crittenden, president of
the junior class; William Andrews, presi
dent of the sophomore class, and Earle
Booth, president of the freshmen class.
The conference, which lasted for several
hours, was held in the faculty clubhouse
on the campus.
The first tangible attempt to Inaugurate
a system of government at the University
of California for handling such student
misdemeanors as are incident to all aca
demic communities, has been launched as
the result of a long conference had last
night between the members of the stu
dents' affairs committee and a number of
the leaders in the different lines of col
lege activity In the Benior class.

The crack of a firearm and the whistle
of a bullet close to his head caused Jo
seph Lewis, a farmer living on Hay-ward
avenue, near Maud, In San Leandro. to
bend low over the dashboard of his wagon,
and lash his horse into a run to get
away from the dangerous locality as
quickly as possible.
Lewis was driving to Oakland at 3
o'clock this morning with a load of fruit
and vegetables, and was passing Stokes'
ranch, near the Junction of Dutton and
Hayward avenues, when the shot was
fired. The bullet passed close to his head
and fearing that a second and more ac
curate shot might follow he started his
horse on a run and soon came up with
two other farmers, who had heard the
shot and stopped to see what was wrong.
They asked Lewis if he was hurt, and
receiving a negative answer drove on to
Oakland. Lewis also came into town,
where he told some of his friends of the
attempt on his life.
Victor Braga; who lives near the scene,
was Just hitching up his team when he
heard the shot. He rushed out and mado
a search of the field In which the man
must have stood when he fired, but failed
to find any one.
Regarding the shooting Mr. Lewis says:
I left the ranch this mornln* about 2:43
and was Just passing Stoke*' place when I saw
the flash and heard the bullet whistle past
my ear. I don't think it missed me a foot,
and I thousht the next ono might reach the
mark, so I ducked my head and whlDped th*
horse into a run.
I have no Idea who could have fired at me.
as I don't think I have made an enemy that
would try to kill me in all the twenty-eight
years I have lived In this county. I think It

Second â That we heartily disapprove of the
action of the Alameda Board of Trade, so
called, and others. In instituting an Injunc
tion suit for the purpose of hampering our said
City Trustees and causing them to postpone
the performance of what they considered Just
and proper duties In the matter of said fran
chises, all of which delayed action which we
believe to be' detrimental to our interests as
business men.
Third â Believing that many of our fellow
cltlrens have been led to suppose that we have
been implicated in the bringing of the Bald
injunction suit we hereby affix our names
to these resolutions, thereby showing our en
tire disapproval of said action.
J. V. Vosberg spoke along- the same line.

In explanation of the move Constable
Weidler said to-day:
"It is a matter of common knowledge
that the telephone company's property
has been destroyed, that there has been a
serious impairment of public service be
cause of the cutting of wires and cables,
that even the police telegraph and the
fire alarm lines have been interrupted. On
proper showing the application of the
company for appointment of these men
has been granted. They will be us^d to
protect the company's property, and no
matter what might be the grievances of
any one, the company has the right to de
mand that protection, and as a peace uffl
cer I am here to give it to them."
To this end twenty-one employes of the
company, nearly all of whom have been
taken on since the linemen's strike was
Inaugurated, were to-dav sworn In as
deputy constables and were given com
missions by Constable Edward Weidler.
The men who were appointed are as fol

Because of the continued tampering
with its lines in the east side cltie3 the
Sunset Telephone Company has taken
steps to protect not only its property from
the destructive and malicious depreda

ample protection as well to its employes,
who are working against odds to maintain

After the honeymoon Mr. and Mrs. Bur
rell will reside on Vernon Heights in the
artistic little cottage fitted up as a wed
ding gift by the groom's father.
The lavish manner in, which gifts have
been showered upon these young, people
Is testimony of the unusual popularity
tfcey enjoy. Their future residence will
no doubt be the scene of many delightful
gatherings.
At the supper following the marriage of
the happy couple a pleasing surprise was
sprung in the announcement of the en
gagement of James Kenna, a brother of
the bride, to Miss Blanche Morse, the
grand-daughter of Captain Morse of tho
San Francisco detective agency. Both
young people are well known in Oakland
society and Mr. Kenna is one of the clever
young business men in San Francisco ln-
Burance circles.
The groom was attended by his brother,
Ray Burrell. The ribbon-bearers were
Walter Bakewell, Will Orrick. Traynor
Bell, George Davis, Carl Jones, Ambrose
Cowden. James Kenna and Jack Hoffman.
An elaborate supper was served, the
bride and her party being seated at an
immense round table in the north parlor.
Some very handsome gowns were notice
able in the assemblage, the mothers of
the happy couple being elegantly attiredâ
Mrs. Kenna in black, heavily spangled
ret over black silk, and Mrs. Burrell in a
beautiful gray crepe de chine. Mrs.
George Hammer, a sister of the bride,
wore a white gown of Brussels net over
white silk, the yoke and bertha being a
rare pattern of rose point lace. Miss
Grace Burrell wore a pretty green and
white silk.
Among -the guests were Mrs. Kenna's
mother and sisters, Mrs. R. Murray, Mrs.
Fred Will and Miss Murray of San Fran
cisco.
Miss Florence Burrell, the groom's
youngest sister, was bridesmaid, and was
gowned in pain green organdie. Her gown
was made with a triple skirt, the orna
mentation being a Grecian border ap
pllqued with ' green ribbon. She carried
white chrysanthemums.
The bride, always an attractive girl,
never looked prettier than she did to
night in her white gown and filmy veil,
which fell softly about her face.- Her
gown was of mousseline de sole over silk,
with a quaint girdle effect In â¢white satin
ribbon held together with "faggot" stitch
ing. A bertha of rare old lace, which, by
the way, was an heirloom, outlined the
transparent yoke. A great bouquet of
Bride roses and maidenhair fern com
pleted the dainty costume.
Miss Ada Kenna attended her sister as
maid of honor, and was attired in white
point d'esprit over white silk, the trim-,
mlng consisting of an elaborate arrange
ment of white satin ribbon. She carried
white chrysanthemums.
families are known throughout
the State, the bride being a daughter of
P. J. Kenna and a niece of the Rev. Rob
ert Kenna, S. J., president of the Jesuit
College at Santa Clara. The groom is the
youngest son of A. W. Burrell, one of the
most prominent constructors on this
coast. Both families are old and highly
esteemed residents of Oakland and have
hosts of friends, so the marriage of the
young people this evening caused more"
than a ripple of interest on the surface
of social affairs'.
Tho weeding,, which took place at the
Kenna hdme; â¢â¢ on Thirteenth avenue, was
an unusually pretty affair. Outside of the
relatives the guests Included only the
young "folks who have grown up with the
bride and groom, about 150 being present
at the ceremony.. ' . , :
At one end of the large drawing-room
a double dais had been erected, on the
higher rise being an altar covered with
graceful ferns and glittering with the
light of many candles. Over all was a
canopy of ferns. The wide folding doors
of the various apartments were thrown
â¢back and the arches outlined with grasses
and ferns. The general color effect was
green, with an occasional touch of white
in carnations and chrysanthemums.
At 8:30 o'clock the bridal party entered,
being met at the door of the rear draw
ing-room by the ribbon bearers; who
formed an aisle to the altar,, where the
bride was met by the groom and his best
man. The nuptial blessing was pro
nounced by the bride's uncle, the Rev.
Father Kenna.

WHITTIER, Sept. 24.â Fire broke out
early - this morning in the build
ings of the Warner Oil f Company
here, and before the blaze could
be extinguished a loss of $6000 had
resulted. Other companies operating in
the neighborhood gave the residents
warning of the conflagration by blowing
whistles, and scores of citizens hurried to ,
the scene and aided materially In pre
venting the spread of the flames.
The fire was due to an accident. Wil
liam Seaman, one of the workers about
the wells, crawled to the top of a 1000
barrel tank to discover how much oil
had been pumped Into it. He held a
lighted lantern in his hand and this ig
nited the gases that had formed. In
stantly the whole tank burst into a blaze
and Seaman had a narrow escape. He
was painfully but not seriously burned.
The fire quickly spread to another tank
of the same size as the first, and a little
later to a 100-barrel tank. All three of
the oil receptacles were destroyed. The
larger tanks exploded and the* fiery con
tents were scattered far and wide over
the fields. One stream of oil found Its
way down Into an adjoining canyon and
set fire to a derrick of the company. En
ergetic work prevented what bade fair to
be a most disastrous conflagration.

Yesterday Superintendent Leach re
ported to Burns that a certain amount of
gold had been stolen from the Mint. It
appears that two miners, arriving: late in
the city, had brought their wealth to the
Mint about 1 o'clock Wednesday after
noon. The latest time at which deposits
are usually received is noon, but that
these two men might be accommodated
the officials received the du3t, agreeing
to melt and assay it yesterday. Yester
day mornin? it was discovered that be
tween $60 and 170 worth of gold was miss
ing, hence the investigation.
Secret Service Agent Burns took charge
of the case and questioned Hundley. At
first the accused denied his guilt, but af
ter a severe cross-examination admitted
that he was responsible for the shortage.
In company with Burns he visited a sa
loon on Fifth street, where he had hidden
his loot. When asked to produce it he
willingly complied and the stolen gold was
returned to the Mint. Then it was that
the clerk was requested to resign and his
resignation was accepted without hesita
tion.
"William P. Hundley, assistant welshing
clerk of the United States Mint of this
city, confessed yesterday to Secret Ser
vice Agent William J. Burns that ho had
stolen gold dust from a depositor and was
immediately dismissed from the service.
It 13 due to the charity of the Federal
officers that the offender was not lodged
behind prison bars to answer to a felony
charge. This Veins h-s first offense, and
the stolen gold being recovered, dismissal
and disgrace -were deemed sufficient pun
ishment.

It is expected that the total clean-up
during the present month will so exceed
that of September of last year that the
production* for both years will be
equalized.
The figures given are from the records
of the Comptroller at Dawson and based
upon the export tax entries. . The total
gold shipments during May, June, July
and August of this. year were $6,957,133.
The total output during the corresponding
months of 1902 was $8,058,797. The decrease
amounts to $1,101,684.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 24.â Despite
adverse conditions the output of gold
from the Klondike this season up to the
end of August* is only $1,000,000 behind
that' of last year for the same period.
Lack of water caused the decrease In the
output. Early this month, a fair amount
of rain fell and washing was recom
menced in earnest.

CHICAGO. Sept. 24.â The Northwestern
markets showed strength and St. Louis was
better, and this, with relatively, firm cables,
started shorts to covering. There was also a
fair demand for long account. December open
ing about steady at 77%@77%c. was bulled to
77Sc early and the general tone showed im
provement. It soon became apparent that there
was no outside support and general liquida
tion and only ceased when the December op
tion had receded to 76 The weakness in
corn had no influence whatever and the gen
eral news was bearish. Some buying ' on the
decline, influenced to some degree by an urgent
cash demand from Minneapolis, caused part of
the loss to be regained at the close, with a
Etcadler tone.' â¢December finished at 70%@
7C>4c. a loss of %c
There was .firmness* In corn at one time and
after an early slump prices went slightly over
the opening. Commission house buying on the
decline, with light offerings, were the influ
ences and aside from these there Â¦ was little
to give strength to ' the market. December
closed at 45%@45%c. a net loss of l%c.
In sympathy with other grains, oats devel
oped weakness and prices broke moderately.
December close*? off %c at 37i,@37V4c
Packers were heavy sellers of provisions
and the market was weak, although quite ac
tive at the close. Trading- consisted chiefly
of covering by shorts in the nearby months and
liquidation In the instant futures and tho
prices throughout the day. ruled lower. Oc
tober pork closed 70c down and ribs 10@12Hc
lower.

Business on the morning session of the Bond
Exchange continued light. The -only feature
was a- sharp advance in' Alaska Packers from'
$154 to $157, due probably to the good showing
the 1 association Is now making. 'The salmon
market . Is in excellent shape and the associa
tion controls the bulk of the supply of Alaskan
fish. Contra Costa Water was firmer at $50
bid and there was a sale of California Fruit

this large line had been sold prior to arrival
and some of it will be placed in warehouse,
the market felt the effects of the influx and
weakened. There was no ' actual decline, but
holders were offering freely to buyers, who
held off for lower prlce3. The weakness- in

Chicago was lc off. There was no news
from the East except that some of the mills
at Minneapolis were still running, notably the
small ones, the Washburn mills and four of
the PUIsbury's. Otherwise the mills were
closed down by the labor strike. The Cincin
nati Price Current says there Is no good rea
son for regarding the Wheat crop of this
country as less than 670,000.000 bushels, while
the domestic consumption will bo about. 450,
000,000 bushels, leaving, with reserves the
same as last year. an. exportable surplus of
Â£20.000,000. The exports last season were but
203,000,000, while during the first two months
of the present season we have shipped some
20,000,000 bushels less than during the cor
responding period last season. "There ap
pears to be nothing in sight," says' the Price
Current, "to indicate that importing countries
will require more Wheat this year than last,
from- this country."
This market is flat and weak, with still

Nearly all descriptions under this head were
in ample supply and the market was quiet,
the local demand being light and there being
no inquiry for shipments. Fancy, highly col
ored Apples in 4-tIer boxes sold off well
enough and choice Bartlett Pears were steady,
but common Apples and Winter Pears were
dull. Some dealers were asking $1 75 for fine
Bartletts, but the -very best offerings from
the mountain districts could be bought at .the
top quotation. The market was overloaded
with table Grapes and there was a sharp drop
in prices, Offerings in crates were particularly
dull, and it was difficult- to obtain over 60c
per crate, for anything but Isabellas. Orders
for shipment on the Portland steamer, out .to
day, are very light. Advices from the north
pay that Portland and other northern .mar
kets are overstocked with Grapes shipped from
here and direct from the growing districts.
Supplies of Peaches were excessive, and prices
of small packages had a further decline. Oc
casional lots of Solways in bulk were received
and were sold to. the canners at $20rg25 per
ton. Prunes, Quinces, Figs and Pomegranates
were offering freely and prices stood about as
previously quoted. Melons were plentiful and
easy at previous .price*. There- were no
changes in Berries, the demand and. suDDly
about balancing. There was a fair inquiry
for choice and fancy Ora*nges for shipment to
Honolulu, .but as supplies, were ample, prices
were unchanged. Mexican Limes are selling at
easier rates. The Panama steamer brought up

Then numerous souls arose in turn and
testified â in a few words now happy they
were for the better life they were leading,
and then the band, under the direction of
Major Finn, discoursed hymns and a
grand march, and the major and Mrs.
Finn sang the duet, "On the Cross of
Calvary." It was a great night of joy
and appreciation with the Salvation
Army.

of $23,750 and there is a mortgage on the
property for $18,000, which the army Is
sanguine of. lifting with the aid of its

The "house warming" and dedicatory
exercises were without any particular or
set ceremony. In the absence of Colonel
French, whose arduous duties have been
such as to have compelled a retirement
for a few weeks from active service In or
der that he may regain his strength, Mrs.
Colonel French conducted the exercises
with the assistance of Brigadier Wood,
general secretary of the army on the Pa
cific coast: Staff Captain Boyden, one of
the first . Salvationists to settle on the
coast; Major Finn 'and Mrs. Finn, Staff
Captain Day and Adjutant General Mont

Mrs. French In asking praise for their
latest achievement in. being able to pro
cure the sacred edifice for their new
home, touchingly reviewed the methods
of the army. Those of the public, : she
said, who were unfamiliar with -their
work must not judge them by their
trumpet sounds or by the shaking of their
tambourines, or the beating of their
drums, but would find their work at the
bedside of the dying, softening the pillow
of the sick and offering the hand of help
to the forlorn, the friendless and whoever
sought salvation, for as best they could
they showed the wanderer the way of
light from the darkened path.

NO SET CEREMONY.
With volleys of hallelujahs and songs
of Joy and praise the Salvation Army
took possession last night of their new
Congress Hall and provincial headquar
ters, 1271 Mission street. The building un
til recently was devoted to the sacred ser
vices of the Swedish Lutheran Church.
The army took leave of Its old head
quarters, 1139 Market street, during the
early part of the evening and then with
its band leading marched to the new
quarters, where saving work is to be
done and where the lost and weary may
find consolation and assistance.

MRS. SUSIE C. RIJNHART of

siderable international fame,
gained through her several
years' experiences as a mission
ary among the wildest of the Thibetan
tribes, to whose country she is now re
turning, is a guest at the Occidental
Hotel, where she Is quietly awaiting the
departure of the China steamer on Sep
tember 29. Although she once narrowly
escaped death at the hands of the supery
stitlous savages who murdered her^ hus
band, Mrs. Rijnhart purposes to invade
again the territory which recalls to her
mind many trying and frightful hard
ships. She goes on a religious mission.
Accompanying the brave woman are Dr.
and Mrs. A. L. Shelton of Anthony,
Kans., who will co-operate with her In a
plan to establish a hospital and found
an industrial school near Ta Chien Lu,
â¢which is situated on the extreme Eastern
border of Thibet. Ta Chien Lu is a trading
place Into which the Thibetans journey
at different times of the year from the
farthermost fastnesses of their country,
and mainly for this reason Mrs. Rijnhart
deslre3 to begin her missionary work
there, planning eventually to push farther
Into the wild interior.
AT THE SACRED LAMASERY.
In 1834 Mrs. Rijnhart and her husband,
a Hollander, who had previously been do
ing missionary work in the Lama district
of Thibet, journeyed after their marriage
in Ontario back to Thibet, where they
labored religiously for four years, during
which the sad experiences of Mrs. Rijn
hart, which included the loss of a babe
and the death of her husband, were en
countered and eventually furnished the
material for a book which she wrote un
der the title of ""With the Thibetans In
Tent and Temple." While stationed at
Lasar, near the lamasery of Kumbum,
Rijnhart and his wife, who were both
skilled in medicine, were warmly wel
comed by the Buddhist priests; In fact,
they enjoyed the special distinction of be
ing the first and only white persons ever
received within the sacred lamasery,
where they were given shelter during the
Chinese-Moslem troubles. With these
troubles began the worst of the hardships
endured so bravely by Mrs. Rijnhart. Pre
vious Moslem uprisings had resulted In
fearful slaughter, and it was thought by
the people there that a recurrence of the
troubles was impossible. Suddenly, how
ever, another outbreak occurred and a
frightful massacre ensued, resulting, so it
was estimated, in the death of 100,000 per
sons, and continued until the} arrival of
the Chinese general, who finally quelled
the disturbance and restored peace.
SUCCORED THE WOUNDED.
In the midst of these terrible scenes
Rijnhart and his wife worked unremit
tingly in the towns, temporary hospitals
and in the camps and on the field, admin
istering in their medical as well as their
missionary capacity to the wounded and
dying. All this time the couple endeav
ored to maintain the schools and churches
they had established after many difflcul
tiâ¬s, and received much'Support from the
better element of the tribesmen, who
seemingly keenly appreciated the self
denying efforts of the two white visitors.
Toward the close of the third year Rijn
hart and his wife, after providing them
selves with food and other necessities for
a long Journey, left Kumbum and Tankar
with plans fully prepared for a trip
through the valley of the Tsaidam, which
extends a distance of 600 miles. and is a
difficult country to penetrate. ! On this

The Board of Works recommended yes
terday to the Board of Supervisors that
five additional copies of -the relief map
of the Tuolumne water shed be printed

The Supervisors' Committee on Arti
ficial Lights yesterday reported In favor
of requesting the, San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company to extend its wires so
that the residents of Ocean View may
have the benefit of incandescent lights.
Action was taken on the petition of the

Want Teachers' Certificates.
Eight applicants took the examination
yesterday for teachers' certificates. The
examination was under the supervision of
Deputy Superintendents of Schools Shel
ley and Howard. The' subjects included
music, stenography, typewriting and
bookkeeping.
Concerning Thibet, she said:
It Is the only country In the world '. that in
not open to the gospel. Naturally It is the
last to encourage commercial ; relations with
the outside world, but I believe it will be
opened soon. A congress is now In session at
Simla with that purpose in view. The future
access of the outside -world to Thibet depends
greatly on the political conditions in China,
which, Indications suggest, , are slowly chang
ing. â¢Â¦"â¢..:..-
Yet' this brave woman; with all these
terrible experiences still fresh In her
,mlnd, is now bent on a mission to the
same country, whither she goes with the
view of remaining many years, teaching
the gospel. and giving medical aid to the
need y' among, those who not long ago
showed their hostility toward her. In
speaking of the long journey be
fore her Mrs., Rijnhart said yes-'
1 terday that she expects to re
main several months* in Central China
and ' will then proceed on to Ta Chien
Lu. -There she '.will, at once set about the
establishing of a hospital and an Indus
trial school, â¢ a work in which she will
be assisted by Dr. and Mrs. Shelton, who,'
like herself, are laboring for. the Chris
tian church. â¢'Â¦-:. -'. -
RETURNING TO THIBET.
It would be hard for me to make a very fine
distinction between the many frightful -inci
dents which I passed through. One of the
worst, perhaps, was the time I slept alone on
the ground in a wild part of Thibet and had
seventeen ferocious dogs howling about me
all night and endeavoring to get their fangs
in my flesh. I am afraid of a dog anywhere,
but these Thibetan dogs are the worst kind pos
sible. They are half-Â«tarved mongrels and are
kept chained most of the time near the tents
of the Bheepherders. I happened at this time
to be traveling without a guide, but 'had my
passport. It was near- midnight when I
reached a sheep camp, and, upon my request
to be allowed to pass the niKht there I was
conducted to a spot some distance from the
tents. Here I made myself as comfortable as
possible with my blankets and was Just sink
ins into a doze when I heard the awful howl
of the- dogs as they bore down, upon me. I
rose to a kneeling posture, gathered my blank
ets in beneath me, holding them out from my
face with my arm so that the dogs could not
bite my head. In this manner I passed the
entire night, the fierce din of the dogs driv
ing away all thought of sleep even had I been
so composed .as to .have made this possible.
At another time I slept in a pig sty, the pigs'
being at one .end. and I at the other. I have
walked for days over flinty paths, with no pro
tection for my feet but my worn Thibetan boots,
through the holes of which the blood from my'
cuts â¢ and- bruises literally poured. I always
carried a revolver, and have walked for miles
and miles suffering the most excruciating agony
with the gun leveled at the treacherous guide*
who walked Just before.
Of these trying times Mrs. Rijnhart
says: :.i;*;^i-
Left alone in a strange country, inhab
ited by treacherous people, the heart
broken woman accomplished something
that few of her sex would have dared
undertake. A wearisome journey of sev
eral hundred miles still lay before her,
and upon this she embarked with the de
termination of one who realized that hes
itancy meant Quicker death than a con
tinuance of the trip. She walked on an
average of twenty-five miles a day, un
guided by men, who, however, she fre
quently saw. but carefully avoided.
Mrs. Rijnhart's story of her travels
with blistered feet through densely
wooded forests and over stony mountain
passes where her bared feet were cut
and bruised; crossing streams in all kinds
of weather; for weeks sleeping in the
open where her only shelter was a. bright
Thibetan sky; where she was a prey to
rapacious and Immoral natives, and the
object of attack from dogs and other ani
mals, Is a harrowing one.
PREY TO MAN AND BEAST.
That the guide had carried out a plot
to murder her husband Mrs. Rijnhart has
every reason for believing.
Their guides, who were untrustworthy
and plotting robbery, murder or other
crimes, caused the Rijnharts constant
anxiety and finally this feeling on the
part of the wife was fully justified when,
her husband, after the guide had cruelly
abandoned him, left her, saying he
wanted to reconnoltcr a hill, but he never
returned.
HER HUSBAND MURDERED.
+ ! ; J
trip, just before reaching Naghchuka, the
child of Mr. and Mrs. Rijnhart died and
was buried on the way. - Arriving at
Naghchuka, the Rijnharts made further
preparations for their advance to Lhassa,
but were informed by the dignitary of the
town that they would be prohibited from
going farther 6outh. Attempts to evade
the officials of the town and enter the
southern country proved futile, and final
ly, with their guides, the Rijnharts left
the Thibetan shores and started home
ward, following the west Shanghai route.
The experiences of this journey form the
most thrilling portion of Mrs. Rijnhart's
life.
DARING MISSIONARY WHO IS
RETURNING TO THE INHOS
PITABLE THIBETANS.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
approved the plans of the City Architect
for terra cotta flues and galvanized iron
chimneys for the Noe Valley School. The
estimated cost of the work is $1035. The
original -plans called for a heating plant
in the building and no provision was made
for stoves, which are now to be used for
the sake of economy. The Board of Ed
ucation also approved the plans.
The board awarded the contract for
constructing retaining walla, coping,
steps, pavements, etc., for the Noe Valley
School to Flinn & Treacy for $2897.
The board also approved amended plans
for the Almshouse Chapel to cost $4000.

ADOPTS PLANS FOR FLUES
IN" NOE VALLEY SCHOOL
The Supervisors* Street Committee yes
terday postponed action for one week on
tne application of the Western Pacific
Railway Company- for a franchise on Six
teenth street, from Kansas street to the
water front. A representative of the
company* was informed that .the only ac
tion the committee would take would be
to refer the petition to the City Engineer
for investigation and report.
At the request of the Santa Fe Ball
way system action on Its petition for a
franchise on Seventh, Eighth, Seven
teenth, Eighteenth and other streets was
deferred until next Thursday.
The committee approved the plans of
the Santa Fe Company for a steel bridge
across Channel-street waterway at Third
street. The plans have been approved by
the Harbor Commission and will be sent
to the United State3 Engineer for his ap
proval.'
Consideration of the petition of Walter
Campbell that the United Railroads be
prohibited from permitting passengers to
ride on the steps of the cars went over for
one week, when the petitioner and repre
sentative of the company will be heard.
B. Lantry appeared to show cause why
his permit to blast in the Potrero should
not be rescinded on the complaint that
the operations are a menace to life and
property. He assured the committee that
the blasting would be carried on in future
without damage and that only single
blasts shall be fired. On that showing the
permit was not revoked.
The committee reported in favor of re
voking the permits granted to John Kelso
in 1SS9 and 1S94 to blast at Lombard and
Montgomery streets. The committee
ruled that the blasting was being done en
a public street to th9 injury of property.
Ettlinger then declared that he had
only a hazy idea at the time of the fact
that Jacob Eppinger and Joseph Eppinger
were drawing heavily on the funds of the
firm. He maintained that the examina
tion into the books of the firm, which
had been ordered by himself and Her
man Eppinger, had been commenced in
April, but that it had not been com
pleted. Two weeks before the 5th of
June, a shortage of $150,000 had been dis
covered, but at that point all investiga
tion ceased. He further stated that Jacob
Eppinger never made any reports to him
of the loans he had made in the name
of the firm.
The questioning of the creditors' attor
ney then drew forth some light upon the
close combination between the firms of
Eppinger & Co. and Ettynger & Co. A*t
torney Freidenrich asked:
"Do you know of the amount you ad
vanced to Ettlinger & Co. for a period of
two years prior to the failure?"
"I do not."
"In your capacity as manager of the
valley lands for the firm of Eppinger &"
Co., did you pay the State assessment
upon reclaimed lands owned by Ettlinger
& Co.?"
"I did."
"From the funds of Eppinger & Co.?"
"Yes."
SHADY TRANSFER MADE.
The attorney then took up the "subject
of the payment made by Herman Ep
pinger Jr. upon his debt of $50,000.
"Did you take those lands in San Luia
Obispo County in full payment of the
debt which Herman Eppinger Jr. owed
to your firm?"
â¢ "Yes."
"If you yourself appraised those lands,
what did you find them to be worth?"
"About $41,000.!'
"The firm of Eppinger & Co. was not
Interested in those lands before the trans
fer, was made?"
"No."
"You did not know at the time that
those ' lands had been sold . in 1896, when
they were supposed to belong to,â¢Ep
pinger & Co., to = pay for delinquent
taxes?" |
"No. Eppinger had told us that there
was some slight litigtion over back taxes,
but that it was not sufficient to cloud the
title." ; ;â¢ Â£:\:
Ettlinger was then questioned about the
relations between the Pacific Coast Ware
house Company' and his own- firm. He
said that the former, concern belonged to
Eppinger & Co.- He said that as .vice
president of his firm he signed all ware
house receipts after they had received the
signature of the secretary, but that he
kept no . record of such receipts and did
not know where the stufrbook from which
they were taken was. He professed ig
norance as to the whereabouts of the
warehouse book, as well as the receipt
book. Ettlinger also stated that no meet-'
ing or election of. officers o^ the Pacific
Coast Warehouse Company had been held
since the inception of the concern in 1890.
"Jacob Eppinger said tha,t Bowles was
pressing us to take up his wheat loans
and that we could not meet the obliga
tion. â¢ That was all," replied Ettlinger.
DISCLOSES COMBINATION".
In detailing the business affairs of the
firm Ettlinger, like his partner, Herman
Eppinger, passed the whole burden of the
failure up to Jacob Eppinger, the senior
member of the firm. He maintained that
he had nothing to do with the buying and
selling of grain in San Francisco, nor
with the details of the warehouse busi
ness, but that his duties consisted In keep,
ing up the business end of the firm in the
interior. To, every qyestion concerning the
ventures of the firm in the wheat market
Ettlinger replied that Jacob Eppinger
managed all the financing of the firm and
that he rarely knew what was going on.
"When were you first aware that the
firm intended to call a meeting of its cred
itors?" queried Attorney Freidenrich.
"Not until the day when Jacob and Her
man Eppinger discussed it in our office-
June 5, I think."
"You were present at the consultation
with President P. E. Bowles of the Amer
ican National Bank when he demanded
additional securities on his notes?"
"I was."
"And yet this did not seem to you an
ominous proceeding?"
"I can't say that it did, since i' knaw
nothing of. the financing of the firm;
Jacob Eppinger tended to_all that."
"You were present at the meeting on
June 5 when it was decided to call a
meeting of the creditors," persisted
Freidenrich. "What reason was' given by
your partners for the necessity of such a
move?"
"With the examination of Bernhard Ett
linger before Referee In Bankruptcy Mil
ton J. Green yesterday afternoon the tak
ing of testimony by the attorneys repre
senting the creditors of the ruined firm
of Eppinger & Co. came to a close. Ett
linger, the last of the three partners in
the insolvent wheat firm to be cross-ques
tioned/ although manifestly an unwilling
witness, made some disclosures of the
business methods of the defunct grain
broking firm which tally well with the
exposures elicited from the witnesses pre
viously examined.
By Ettlinger's admissions a piece of
very sharp practice was uncovered In the
form of a business transaction between
Herman Eppinger Jr. of- the firm of Ett
linger & Co. and the firm of Eppinger &
Co. in October of last year. He said that
in full settlement of a debt of $50,000
which Herman Eppinger Jr. owed to the
Epplngers the latter firm received the
titles to certain properties near Paso
Robles. in San Luis Obtspo County, ap
praised by Bernhard Ettiinger^himself at
a value of $41,000. Attorney Freidenrich,
who conducted the examination, then
stated to the witness that he had proof
to the effect that thede self-same lands
were sold by the State for delinquent
taxes in 1896, and at that time they were
held in the name of Eppinger & Co.
Ettlinger was not to be caught In.fur
ther damaging admissions, and therefore
stated that at the time of the transfer
Herman Eppinger Jr., who was supposed
to be the possessor of the titles in ques
tion, had said that there was some litiga
tion about delinquent taxes, but that it
was not of a serious nature and In no
way clouded the title to the land. Ett
linger denied that the firm had any
knowledge of the fact that the land In
question had reverted to the State.

Helen Davenport Seeks
Divorce After Years
of Peace.
Says MJfein She Married Forty-
Four Years Ago Is a
Drunkard.
It Is seldom that a couple who have
lived together as husband ana wife for
almost half a century enter the divorce
court, but occasionally such a thing bap
pens. It occurred In this city yesterday
and it Is a matter of reoord that never
before In the history of this municipality
have a couple who have managed to get
aJcng peacefully fcr forty-four years
brought their matrimonial troubles Into
the courts for adjudication. The plaintiff
in the suJt is Helen E. Davenport and
the defendant is William A. Davenport,
a carriage manufacturer. They were mar
ried May 2. Iio9. and reside at 509 Franklin
street.
The divorce is sought for on the ground
of habitual intemperance, Mrs. Daven
port alleging In her complaint that for
the last five years her husband has been
bo addicted to the use of intoxicants that
be has been unable to attend to his busi
ness. His conduct, she says, has rendered
the last days cf her life miserable.
The footlights possess more of an at
traction for Constance Adalr McBride
than does the position of a matron. Such
at leajrt is the claim of her husband, John
McBride. who yesterday tiled a suit for
divorce against her. In bis complaint he
accuses her of deserting him in June,
13C0, or less than one year after she be
r-mo his wife. In an affidavit supporting
n motion that a summons in the divorce
proceedings be by publication he states
that she left him because she was infat
uated with the life of an actress and had,
after leaving him. written him a letter in
which she said she was tired of life wfth
him and would henceforth devote herself
to the pursuit of histrionic honors. They
Â¦wire married at Terre Haute, Ind.
Virginia E. Holland, who was married
to William H. Holland on September 14.
1SS4, would have the marriage ties severed
because of his alleged cruelty. She says
that since February. 1S9?, when he threw
a wash-basin at her, her life ha? been an
unhappy one. She claims that after the
wash-basin episode he treated her In a
rhameful manner, even going so far as to
xr\\ her that he was 'dred of her. She
says that he also remained away from,
him home for days and nights at a tlm 3
and consorted with gamblers and other
people with questionable reputations. She
closes her complaint by saying that her
cup of misery was billed to overflowing
Thanksgiving day, 1901, when, she says,
her husband deliberately insulted a num
ber of friends she had invited to dinner.
Cruelty is also charged in the complaint
for divorce filed by Etta Nealon against
James Joseph Nealon. They were married
nine years ago and Mrs. Xealon says that
almost continuously since their wedding
day N-valon has treated her shamefully.
ShÂ»Â» says that he has frequently threat
ened to kill her, has repeatedly beaten her
and almost daily called her vile and filthy
names. A short lime ago, she says, she
and her three children became so fright
ened at his actions that they sought
refuge In the streets and remained out
until late at night, or until such time as
they felt reasonably certain he would be
asleep.
Failure to provJde is charged in the suit
brought by Assunta Roller! against Do
menico Rolleri and desertion is charged
in the suit in which Anna C. Andrews is
plaintiff and Charles W. Andrews defend
ant.
Divorces for desertion were granted to
Annette Mooney from Daniel J. Mooney,
Octavia Mackie from A. P. Mackie, ' W.
H. Tenney from Alice B. Tenjiey, Agoston
Haraszthy from Minnie Haraszthy, Eva
D. Trimble from Charles R. Trimble and
Mari* J. Dipple from "William Dipple.
Cruelty caused the separation of Emma
Becker from John Becker and A. V.
Martin from J. A. Martin, and infidelity
was the ground on which J. Ode'.l secured
a divorce from M. Odell.
