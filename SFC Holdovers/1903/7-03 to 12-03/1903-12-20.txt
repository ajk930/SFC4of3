about the brotherhood of man, but
ouif beautiful words are "not always

people are too often disposed to limit
the obligation of love to those within
their own fold whom they unctuously
call"brethren" and even then it is no
guarantee because a man belongs to
a church that he loves his fellow
member In the next pew.- Socialists

appeal to us. In fact, to be perfectly
honest, they bore us. We remember
the young man's reply who after he
had listened to his friend's long and

thought he ought to marry, replied,
"I hay* no doubt that every word you

One can, indeed, if he will, love all
men in the sense of wishing them well,
of seeking their highest interests, of
serving them as he has opportunity.

seen the beautiful copy of Our Lady of
Kazan. The original of this Madonna
is treasured in the beautiful Kazanskl

found several hundred years ago by a
little girl in the outskirts of the city of
Kazan. The erems and hand-beaten
robes of gold with which it is orna

Bee, then, how faithfully the Lord
himself answers for the truth of the
prophecy: The Holy Ghost came upon
Mary, and the power of the Highest
overshadowed her (St. Luke 1., 35); and
she conceived, being still a virgin; and
having become the mother of the son,
nevertheless remained a virgin. In or
der that those who were unacquainted
with the mystery of this conception
should not be able to malign' her who
had conceived, she was betrothed to her
husband before that conception; and
that to every healthy mind this Elgn of
the Lord mlg,ht be clear, that a virgin
had conceived without a husband, the
conception followed the espousals, even
before they came together ' (St. Matt.
1:24), even before Joseph took unto him
his wife <SL Matt 1:19) Into his house.
To Joseph himself an angel was sent
to reveal this mystery, and to show him
this sign, so that he should not remain
in doubt: while to others, who could
neither see nor hear angels, a no less
trustworthy witness of the sign and
herald of the .mystery was given in
the person of Joseph himself, who was
known to all as a Just man (St. Matt.
1:19), and therefore was unable to de
ceive people, and still less able to slan
der God and the Holy Spirit. â¢ â¢ â¢

He helped her acoartf. aod they went
heeling out over the bay. Frisby, un
der four reefs, followed. His face,
still hard and set, gave no hint of tho
tumult in his mind. With the tiller in
one hand ' and the straining sheet In
the other \ he followed Drake's cat
boat across the bay.- He could see the
spray come over; her bows in bucketfuls
as the wash struck her, and with every
flaw she lay over until her boom dipped.
He saw Harriet close to Drake In the
cockpit, and once, when the flaw heeled
them over more .than j usual, he heard
the girl's little scream and her nervous
laughter after it. He shut his teeth. -
. "Don't wonder the papers get plenty
of scare-head drownings," he growled.
"It's such girls as she makes 'em," be
added bitterly.
At the other tido of the BtCo bay
they came about and headed for Dm
open sea. Frisby followed suit. De
spite his extra reef, he held his own
with them. When they -passed the
point the full strength of tho gale
struck thorn. - They had gone but a
short distance when a flaw boro down
upon them. Frisby was looking anx

He saw Drake endeavor to lot bis

Frisby ran alongside, cattghf sight
of a brown Â¦ head in tho water and
pulled Harriet aboard. Drake was no
where to be seen. For several anxious
moments he waited. Then | from under
the sail Drake's white face came to
the surface. Frisby ran forward and
managed to get a hold on the hair.
For a ha art- breaking minute It seemed
the sea would tear Its prey from him,"
but grimly he kept his hold, and final-,

deck beside him.
Wa efforts to get dear of the sail
had exhausted Drake. He lay In the
cockpit, , white . and breathing faintly.
Frisby came about and started back.
Ho turned to the girl, his eyes blaming.
"Take the tiller and kÂ»ep this
oourse," he said harshly. "Ease off
tho sheet when it flaws. I guess
you've done for him," he added brutal
ly, as he bent over Drake.
He worked over the .unconscious
man, and when at last tho eyelids
opened waverlngly, he put his brandy
flask between Drake's teeth. Then he
turned to the girl. 8he stood heroic
ally at the tiller, wet, disheveled and
shivering pitifully, while great tears
rolled down her cheeks.
"Keep yourself together," Frisby said
sharply. "Better take some brandy.'*
,Â¦ She shook her head miserably. Frisby
caught the tiller and held out tha" flask.
"Take it," he said shortly. Meekly
she obeyed.

"Am I going out?" cried Harriet, In
response to a query from Stanley
Drake. "Indeed I am. It'll be gor

He scrambled from the cockpit and

sharply.

taking any chances If you are going."
"If you won't ~ take me along just as
you were going yourself I won't go,"
she announced:

Her lips curved disdainfully. She

She had known Jack Frisby for five

"You're afraid," she mocked.

"Then I shall go with some one who

Frisby said nothing, but in deter

when he went to "meeting." Religion
furnished him with opportunities for
i varying his excitements. When the
meetings lagged or otherwise met with
his disapproval, he was a ringleader
among those who were ready to break
up the services. One of his most mo
cessful exploits in this line was ac
complished In the following manner:
Early one morning he, with three oth
ers, had collected a number of lengths
of old stovepipe and several pieces of
heavy scrap iron. These were ingen
iously fastened together and then
placed on the beams above the celling
in the "meeting house." A hole was
bored In the front and another In the
back of the upper part of the building.
Wires were attached to the mass of old
metal so that It could be pulled back
ward and forward over the beams
above the audience below. That night
es the "Campbellite" brother was in
the midst of a vivid portrayal of the
terrors of the infernal regions, a mys
terious and terrific din, which made the
house tremble, caused men, women and
children, in an agony of fear, to rush
screaming from the building. A search
was made for the offenders, who could
be arrested if caught, but the wires
reached to the woods before and behind
the "meeting house" so that the two
pairs of young mischief makers were
concealed and safe. When the preacher
began again the noise recommenced
until finally, in despair, the congrega
tion was dismissed.
For several weeks after his marriage
Smith had settled down to hard work.
Then back again he went to the old
wild life, and was often away days at
a time. His wife knew his absence had
something to do with the "moonshine"
whisky business. In a few years there
were twelve little Smiths. Four times
twins had come into the family, and
four times the little strangers had ar
rived singly. The settlement of Pos
sum Trot for many years had had an
evil reputation-. No one seemed to de
sire, or look for, the coming of better
things. The children were growing up
In the simple, practical life that was
held up before -them. A school was
started. which the newcomersâ Mr. and
Mrs. Bestâ taught. In the past twenty
years school had been . held but six
weeks. Very few had learned to read
print and not one In the place could
write. Following the school came a
church, In the "raising" all hands had
Joined. A new 'Interest was manifest.
A new era had dawned for Possum
Trot.
Columbus Smith and Indiana, his
wife, were among the first to enter the
membership of the little church. The
woman's face lost Its worn and weary
expression, taking on a new and spir
itual beauty. The man was now as In
tense In his desire to do good as he had
formerly been active in evil. Literally
like his Master, he went about doing
good dally. The wildest of bis 'old
companions. at first doubted the reality
and permanency of the change. But
when they were convinced that their
former companion would follow their
ways no longer they decided to "get
some fun out of him." The plot was
carefully concealed and the time for
Its execution set for Christmas eve,
and It was Christmas eve when Colum
bus Smith spoke the words recorded at
the beginning of this story: "We know
what Christmas means now, don't we,
Indiana?" The sun was setting In
glory behind the hazy hills and the
light shed Its radiance upon the father
and mother and their children as they
were grouped at the cabin door. When,
the sun had disappeared they all
dropped to their knees and the father
poured out his heart In gratitude and
love for, all the joy and sunshine that
had come Into their hozae since they
had known the Savior, whose birthday
they were to celebrate on the morrow.
Quietly they went to their beds in the
one room of the cabin and quickly they
all fell asleep. Toward midnight â¢ the
father awoke, feeling that he had
heard sounds coming from the direction
of his barn and orchard. He listened
anxiously, . for Christmas eve was a
time of riotous dissipation In that
mountain country. Suddenly the report
of a rifle rang out and a bullet crashed
through the walL Rapid firing followed
and the children began to cry. For a
moment the old spirit of anger and re
venge gained the upper hand, and,
springing: from his bed. Smith reached
for his rifle. Then, with the loaded
weapon in his hand, he paused and the
spirit of Christ spoke to him, The rifle
was put back over the door with the
words. "I can't use you against those
for 'whom Christ died, when it's Just
the hour when he was born."
Frightened by the quiet in the cabin
rod fearing they had killed some or
all of the Smfths. the crowd broke up
and made for their homes. When the
light of the birthday of . the Prince of
Peace came flooding over the moun
tains and valleys the Smith family one
by one came out of the cabin and gazed
upon a scene of desolation. The fences
were wrecked, the fruit trees had been
chopped down and the horse which
had beea sheared or deprived of tail
and mane presented a ludicrous and
pathetic spectacle. And this was Christ
mas day', Mrs. Smith brought from
the. house a bullet she. had found In
the bed of the' younger children. Co
lumbus breathed hard, and then began
to examine the footprints on the
ground. "Indiana," he said, "hare's the
track of big Bud Bruce and he was at
the head of this fuss, I'm dead certain."
The sharp eye of the mountaineer en
abled him to know accurately the
make-up of tho party that had brought
all this trouble and loss. What could
ha do? Yes, It was Christmas day.
With his hands over his face, Colum
bus Smith sat and struggled. Through
the storm of his thoughts came one
word, faint at first, and then louder.
and the word was "forsrive." Hand In
hand,, husband and wife walked back
and forth before their little place. By
and by the frightened children noticed
an eager, happy look on their parents*
faces, and presently the father called.
"Talmadge, put the bridle on old Bun
comb and come here." and as the ex
cited youngsters gathered In a pushing
group Columbus Smith spoke:
"Children, ma and I has decided wo
must some way have a happy Christ
mas and we are going to Invite tho
whole settlement to celebrate with us.
"We've got a heap of pies and pork and
sorghum, and I reckon some win brtns
'snacks' with them. Talmadge can rlda
up all the coves and call out the In
vite and the rest of us will clear up
and get ready for company. And. Tal
madge, don't forget to ask Bud Bruce
and his friends. We want everybody."
And the? came. The news* of the
night had spread. Many had already
decided to talk It over at headquarters.
To stay away would be a sure Indica
tion of guilt. The guilty ones were
troubled. What could It mean? They
met and talked It over. The result was
that they declared "Smith has always
been a kindly sort of a fellow. We'll
do the right thing by him now." They
forthwith "chipped in** and an old salt
bag was nearly filled with money, for
every pocket was emptied. With other
gifts, including wild turkeys, squirrels,
cornmeal, potatoes, the trouble makers
of the night before Joined their neigh
bors in the big party at Smith's. Mr.
and Mrs. Best were there, and after
games and songs Mr. Best told the
story of the birth of the Savior. "Men,"
he said. In closing his remarks, "Jesus
lived a beautiful life, but not an easy
one, He was cursed, whipped, spit
upon, tormented. Ton know he always
fprgave those who were mean to him.
His life was full of peace and joy. All
who came to know him were made bet
ter. Friends, one and all, to-day we
know that Christ has come to our set
tlement. The message Christ brings la
that God forgives and pardons even hla
enemies. This is what makes Christ
mas Joyous. Here in our settlement
to-day there Is forgiveness and there 1*
happiness."
There were tears In many syesv and
big Bud Bruce elbowed hSa way
through the crowd and threw hi* arm*
around Columbus Smith and shouts and
sobs were mingled and handshakings
began fn all directions. Thus the glad
dest Christmas season Possum Trot

SUNSHINE IN THE MOONSHINE COUNTRY
3IT was called an "open winter" in
Western Iowa, In a year late in
the '70s. Up to the Christmas holi
days there had been no freezing
weather. The swamps and marshes
were brimming 'full from late rains
and the roads were almost bot
tomless mud in v many places. Rank,
decaying vegetation was every

"I hare done that stitch y^tt well,"

"He will grow another," I answered
cheerfully. "Yes. there Is something;

"How amusing your comparisons
are," bantered Phyllis, turning her
brown eyes sideways on me. "That's
like your saying that you admire that

"Well, you can't deny that It was far

WHERE THE LOVE VINE GROWS

ter, was epidemic Many, many chil
dren, both In the town of M and
In th* country adjacent, had died from
Its ravages, for it was before the days of
anti-toxin treatment. A pall seemed to
hang over the whole country, deepened
by the dreary weather. The mournful
winds sighed among the leafless trees,
and the gloomy skies almost continual
ly dripped their moisture, as though
weeping over the misery which their
tears augmented. *
As Christmas approached, the people
were so depressed over their broken
family circles that they had no heart
for festivities. There wer* so many
vacant chairs and empty cradles that
th* thought of seeing the empty stock
togs hung up with many missing was
more than they could bear. So but lit
tle -preparation was mad* to celebrate
the day.
In th* town, the only unmarried min
ister was th* young Methodist preach
er, Mr. Taylor, 'it was his first charge
and was an old-fashioned circuit, con
sisting of th* little church in the town
and several preaching places In the
country, some of them quite distant, as
th* region was but sparsely settled.
Because h* had no family to b* en
dangered, all the burials of th* diph
theria cases fell to this young pastor.
Being thus mad* partaker of the grief
of th* stricken homes his own heart
was sorely distressed. He had never
seen such a harvest of death* and
knowing that nothing but the coming
of cold weather could stay its progress,
he prayed dally for Ice and snow as the
greatest boon heaven could send.
Christmas, that year, came on Tues
day and on the Sunday preceding, find
ing the people too sorrowful to engage
In th* usual commemoration of the oc
casion, th* preacher asked them at
each service to unite with him in pray
ing God to send a winter storm as their
Christmas gift.
The last service of that day was at a
point twÂ«nty-flv* miles southeast from
the town. On Monday morning the
young preacher, wearied from the hard
labor of the day previous, and with a
heart heavy at thought of the misery
ha bad seen among his people, mounted
his hors* to rid* back to th* town. Th*
dim road lay In a northwest direction
â¢ver unfenced prairie*, with only a few
scattered cabins, miles apart. â¢
Shortly after he started a driving
mist rolled in from th* northwest; this
soon changed to sleet and then 'to snow,
while th* foroe of the wind constantly
Increased.
All signs pointed to the approach of
a genuine Iowa bllszard. As the^storm
thickened, the heart of the man beat
higher, for it seemed to promise the
answer to his prayers, and that the
people were to have the Christmas gift
they -had asked. He was warmly clad,
and though compelled to face the
storm, had no thought of personal dan-'
gcr, for his had been a life of much
exposure. .
But, as though hastening to make up
for th* long delay In Its coming, the
storm gathered fury with great rapid
ity. The road was soon obliterated, the
Â¦now took on an Icy character and was
driven like fine shot into the faces of
the preacher and his faithful beast. The
animal continually strove to avoid the
blast by turning from it, and as the
eye could pierce the sheets of whirling
whit* for a few rods only, the way was
lost and the general directions were dis
cernible only by the known direction of
the storm.
The cold increased in a short time to
an Intense degree, 10 that by noon the
situation was desperate. The preacher
had been compelled to dismount and
walk in order to avoid freezing; the
now was nearly knee deep and
blowing in blinding billows, the hors*
could only be pulled along with diffi
culty against the roaring blizzard, now
fully developed. They had wandered
far out of their course and knew not
which way to r>. Hungry, Â©hilled
through, wearied and. buffeted by the
storm almost to exhaustion, and con
fused as to his bearings, at last Mr.
Taylor realized his perlL Would h*
ever reach shelter or would that whirl-
Ing tempest wrap him In Its white
winding shee.t? How long could he
fight It and what avail would the strug
gle be If he were beating in the wrong
direction? How about that Christmas
gift now, for which he had so fervently
prayed? Was he rejoiced that it had
comeâ hurled right across his path and
dashed In his face, unto the Jeopardy
of his life? He thought of the old home,
where parents, brothers and sisters
were even then making happy prepara
tion for the Christmas-tide, doubtless
having sent him some loving tokens to
cheer him in his hard Western field. He
wondered how long it would be before
they would know his fate. If he failed
to fight his way to shelter. He drew
closer around his head a broad knit
scarf, and then came a vision of thÂ«
fair hands which had made it. He saw
the soft-eyed maiden who had wrought
her love Into It and given It to him for
Just such a time as this, when he start
ed for his distant circuit. How would
she feel if he should fall, never to rise
again, In that wild waste of wintry
fury. For a time these homesick
thoughts unsettled his mind and mad*
him doubt the goodness of Ood. Then
came back to him recollections of th*
many heart-rending scenes h* had wit
nessed in the last few month*â children
stricken down in their Innocence;
mothers with agonized faces; fathers
stunned by their grief; homes darkened
and desolate. Could he wish all this
horror to continue merely, because hia
own life was Imperiled by the coming
of the only possible remedy? Then,
with faculties rendered dreamy by the
chilling of the blood, he seemed to see
a picture of One hanging on a cross,
and heard the mocking cry: "He saved
others; himself he cannot save." After
that he was content to let th* storm
rage. If he survived It he would be
thankful, if not, he would be glad to
think that what was death to him
would be life to many other*. After all.
it was the best Christmas gift which
heaven could send.
But he was young and life was sw*et
He had no disposition for mock heroics
or needless martyrdom, so he resolutely
summoned his courage for the supreme
battle of his life. He had lived en th*
broad prairies long enough to know
their treachery in winter. He knew
how many strong men had been caught
like himself In the clutch of the blls
sards on those vast treeless expanses
and buffeted to slow death. He knew
all the symptoms of increasing numb
ness; the passing of pain, the feeling of
lethargy, the creeping sense of ease,
the drowsy weighting of th* eyes, the
almost irresistible wish to 11* down and
sleep and the deadly delusions, which
foretell the approach of the fatal end.
So, during the dragging hours of that
long, desolate afternoon, while he blind,
ly staggered against the fearful aval
anche of snow,' hoping against hop*
that by some lucky chance he might
stumble upon some cabin, pulling his
benumbed horse along by main
strength, he fought every succeeding
symptom of freezing. He pounded hia
arms and stamped his feet, rapped his
head when inclined to doz*. held his
eyelids up with his gloved hands, at
times talked to himself and hi* horse
to keep his mind aroused; prayed to
God and struggled on.
But there is a limit to what eren th*
stoutest heart and the strongest will
can do, under such circumstance*,
against such fearful odds. When th*
day had passed away in th* unequal
contest between the man and th* ele
ments the coming down of darkness
proved to be the additional measure
of horror, which was more than the
preacher, worn out In mind and body,
could withstand. Shortly after th*
night united Us gloom to th* fury of
the storm, those fitful hallucinations
which so frequently precede death by
freezing seized him. Who was that
calling him? Surely horn* is near.

But what Is It stings his brain so? O.

Surely some one is singing, it Is the
time of service In a little country
church. The people have gathered for
worship and he is about to enter the
pulpit to preach, when he falls against
his horse and the shock partially
arouses him. He strives to collect his
shattered wits, fights again the oft-re
peated battle against overpowering
drowsiness, half realizes that the effort
is absolutely futile and is slowly kick
ing a place in the snow to lie down In,
under a growing impression that he Is
turning down the covers of a bed. when
a light feebly shoots through the al
most impenetrable curtain of snowy
darknesS. At first he thought it a part
of his dream, but slowly it brought him
back to reality. He began to think
about it. and at last was roused enough
to know that he must be near a dwell
ing. The blood was quickened enough
by the fact to permit of slow move
ment. He started toward the light,
each step awakening him still more.
until he was again pretty well master
of his dazed faculties. Hope sprang up
I In his heart and quickened tevery pulse.
Then the light disappeared. The horror
of black night, lightened only by fierce
ly driven snow, settled over him aja!n.
A sickening sense of despair weighted
him down. For a little while he was
tempted to believe that the light was
another illusion and that he mlrht as
well give up again, but he stubbornly 1
summoned his little remaining strength
for one final effort to find the house
from which the light must have come.
If there was but one chance for life
he would take that chance, Thi
thought that he was near to safety and
yet might miss it served a whip to his
benumbed faculties. But so dazed was
he, so nearly exhausted and so confus
ing was the fierce storm that It seemed
an age to him before he finally stum
bled against the house without being
able to see it. Slowly he felt his way
along the sides until he came to a doer;
then struck It with the handle of his
riding-whip, which In some manner h*
had managed to keep hold of. Th*
door was opened cautiously by a burly,
whiskered man who peered out and
asked who was there. The preacher's
tongue was too thick for speech, so he
stood In silence, but the man, opening
the door wide enough for the light to
shine out recognized the colored scarf.
"My God! It is Brother Taylor, our
pastor!" he said. Then calling hastily
to a grown son. they came out and
helped him in. The son took the horse
to the stable, while the father, a man of
long experience in prairie life, took the
preacher to a bedroom away from the
fire, removed his garments. Bent for a
pall of snow, laid him on the bed and
with his own strong hands chafed the
chilled body, applying a little mow
occasionally, until the sluggish circu
lation was slowly quickened. Then
tepid water was used and finally warm
water and last of all, copious drinks of
hot milk were given. After that he was
placed under warm covers and left to
sleep as long as he would. ,
It was â¢ o'clock when the faithful
Â¦work of the strong man was ended.
The patient sank at once into the deep
sleep of complete exhaustion. For
hours the family, who were member*
of one of the country churches served
by the young preacher at a point ten
miles out of his right course toward
town, that day watched over him Â«to
note any signs of fever or delirium. But
so well had the wise treatment been
given that he slept as sweetly as a
babe. As they anxiously watched him,
the wife and mother, with tear-dlramsd
eyes, said: "Poor man! the Christmas
gift for which he prayed so earnestly
yesterday In our church. In order that
we might be spared further los* among
our little ones" â here she looked sad-

we were rejoicing over our pastor's

of freezing where the victim Bred
through It." But the preacher slept on.

there himself. The' wind had changed
and was coming around the oorner by
the smoking-room In a very trying
manner, but he hardly noticed that In
his tangled 'emotions over her prox
imity and distance.
She noticed it, though, and strove la
rain to adjust a bit of embroidered
coat collar so as to shut off a growing
gale. Her efforts proving futile, she
summoned a sailor who was busy lash-
Ins; something to something else, and;
opening her purse:
'/Please . carry these three chairs out
of the wind," she said, smiling on him,
and then she went Inside. . .
The sailor grabbed two chairs and
â¢clumped away at a gait demanded by
the exigencies of the situation. .
Durant meanwhile extricated himself
from his rues with a sprlghtllness . to
be envied by the rheumatic and para
lyzed, and was up and waiting when
the emissary of fate returned.
"Here, take my chair, too." he said
to the man, smiling. on him in the
stupid way that men reserve for other
men. The sailor grinned the omnis
cient grin* that deckhands .acquire,
pocketed his fee, and the last two
chairs went away together in as friend,
ly a mariner as the first two had done.
After lunch Miss Gabelle occupied her
chair and, for the first time, did Durant
the honor of noticing his existence by
becoming slightly pink when she ob
served him there in his chair the same
as ever. Later Miss Susan Gabelle,
steward came for the chairs It was In
a voice of the utmost assurance that
he was bidden:
"Take mine, too."
When Miss Gabelle came back she
seemed not at all surprised at seeing
fr<TTÂ» ttill one of their party. She even
smiled again when he sprang up to in
stall' her among her wraps. And then
when she was intrenched in her castle
of pillow and plaid he boldly occupied
the neighboring territory and as the
powers in her case were otherwise en
gaged no one entered a protest.

make matters more agreeable, the wind
freshened so that even upon the shel

uous and solicitous retucklng.
Toward night it began to rain.
"I think that we must move again."
Durant suggested, with a heavy accent
on the "we."
"Dear me, so we must." she an
swered, beginning to prepare to rise.
He sprang to her aid; he extricated
her from her rugs: he hailed a deck
hand and he pointed out his work to
him. ;
"Take those four chairs out of the
wet," he told him In such a tone as
Nelson used at Trafalgar. "He'll have
them all ready when we come up after
dinner," he added to Miss Gabelle. She
smiled sweetly.
"I'm so glad to have met you," she
said as they went Inside (together this
time). "I've been dreading such a long,
lonely voyage."
Durant looked down at her and she
looked ud at him. They both smiled
and she blushed.

family to the end that he might merit
gratitude and an Introduction, , sprang
to the deck . steward's assistance and
started to bear up the trailing extrem
ities of his load, but Miss Susan Ga
belle yelled, "Don't turn . me upside
down for pity's sake!" and he had to
drop her feet as if they scorched his
hands.
But he was richly rewarded [for his
effort, for the niece became freshly

about the weather, a species of conver

cakes and tea as if he was a new spe

"I think so, too," said Miss Gabelle.
"After you are through with the tea
won't you take our three chairs around
there?" '.
"Gewlas!" said the man, and spun
away.
Miss Gabelle drank her tea with
great breeziness, so to speak, and then
went below to see how her aunt was
surviving. She smiled on Durant as
she passed and hope, foamed high on
the surf of his heart waves. When the

The Instant that she was out of

chair and, hailing a passing steward.
"Take these three chairs and carry
them down to the other end of the
deck," she said, pressing bis hand to
some purpose," and de It right off,

She went Inside directly she saw
him bearing off the first chair, and
Durant lost not a minute In detaching
himself from his rugs to the end that
when the steward returned he might

"Take mine, too." >
The steward grinned and took bis
chair, toe.
When Miss Oabelle reappeared she
looked prettier than ever, and as she
at once opened a book and became
wholly absorbed in It, Durant decided
that the best thing for him to do was
to go to sleep with his face turned in
her direction, and so be able to look
at her all that he wanted to. After
a while he decided that she was the
prettiest girl that he ever had seen,
and that he must know her somehow.
Presently she closed her eyes and soon
after her fingers relaxed their hold of
the book and that slipped onto the
deck. He vaulted over Mrs. Gabelle's
chair, and, picking the book up,
smoothed the leaves carefully and laid
it back on her lap. But she did not
thank him or pay the slightest atten
tion to his polite action. There are
naps on deck and naps on deck, and
Miss Gabelle had not gone, to sleep
with her face turned in Durant's di
rection.

sounded she woke up with a start and

the chair of an* Italian lady who had
a baby. Durant looked across the va
cant seats and saw the baby and
blessed the intervening space. The
Italian lady thought that he wanted
to admire the baby and held it up high
on purpose for him to see. But his gaze
fled out upon the wide ocean beyond,
and he did not recall it until he was
ready to open his book and read.
In the middle of the afternoon a
pretty girl In a red Tam O'Shanter
came up and stood by the rail. Du
rant found himself looking at her
over the top of his book and wishing
that she might be Miss Gabelle. After
a while he had his wish, for she came
across and sat down under her name.
The Italian lady was delighted: her
baby had cried so hard that a kind
hearted somebody had taken It to
walk and left the mother free to en
joy society. Durant had been three

resentful anger burned for a moment
In the padre's heart. Pedro was the one
creature upon earth that the padre
loved even as the padre was the only
human being to hold all of Pedro's de
votion. And was not Pedro, in spite of
counsel, in spite of exhortation. In spite
of commands, playing with the bell
even as he would play with the love
the padre had given him?
Slowly the priest rose from his knees,
slowly he passed between the long line
of empty cells that should have been
filled with converts and ever as he
walked the bell clashed and crashed.
Not until he had entered the chapel
Itself did he hear th$ shouts and cries
of the Indians as they ran toward the
mission, not until he had thrown wide
open the chapel doors did he realize
that there was unusual commotion.
With the draft of the opening doors
rushed a cloud of smoke, downpourlng
from the eaves. Following close upon
the smoke came licking, greedy flames.
One hurried glance at the burning
thatch of the roof told the padre that
the mission was doomed, for not a drop
of water was there In the mission
tanks. Turning back into the chapel.
ne hunTeQ toward the altar. Perhaps
It might be vouchsafed him to save
some of the holy emblems there! Per
haps It might be vouchsafed him to die
at the foot of the cross. Only half way
to the altar had he gone when the roof
of the sacristy fell. An overwhelming,
dense mass of smoke filled the chapel.
The padre fell on his knes and in the
Incense of his own burning altar his
Pedro went on.
"The bell I might have saved, but I
rang It and rang it until I could stay
In the belfry no longer. It has fallen
under all the tower. They may dig it
out,* though. It may still ring."
Antonio groaned aloud, and Pedro
wondered if the father's love for. the
betf was even greater than his lov* for
the golden . altar cross. He had not
groaned when he saw that the cross
was destroyed. Â£>'{Â¦ '\C'%',

The ruins lay just as the flames bad
left them until Padre Antonio was
strong enough to superintend their re
moval, to build again from the very
beginning a new chapel, a new sac
risty, new cloisters, new dormitories.
AH had been destroyed, utterly and ab
solutely.
But the reconstruction of the mission
was not the first work to which Father
Antonio turned. He 'devoted days to a
letter to his superior in Spain, begging
for relief, begging for release. And not
until a courier had been dispatched
down the coast with this appeal could
Antonio give his attention to a new
mission. *With every beam that was
raised, with every brick that was laid,
a prayer was raised, a prayer was hid
that he might be building for his suo
cessor, not for himself. %\ m '
Impatiently he waited for his answer,
so impatiently that- all his duties were
only Irksome details of the day; and
as the time came near when he might
confidently expect, his letter the days
themselves were mere ' fragments of
time piled one upon another.

It was days, weeks, before he came to
himself, before he could hear th*Â» stotry
of his rescue. Then Pedro toJd him
rlowly, a little at a time, how the In
dians gathered together in front of the
chapel, had seen him turn back Into the
church; how they had massed them
selves, fought their way to the spot
where the beloved father lay and car
ried him out. * . / Â¦ '
Days later, when the bandanges were
removed from the padre's eyes, the
first thing- he saw was a Madonna that
had hung above the altar. Blackened
and marred, the frame no longer held
the picture, but the holy Mother's
steadfast eyes looked down upon htm
as calmly and serenely from the walls
of the Indian hovel as ever th*.r had
from the altar of his chapel. Unoer the
-"lcture on a rough Bhelf stood a golden
halice.
The padre's eyes filled, and Pedro,
/tandlng near the cot on which the
priest "lay, saw the tears, and softly
wiped them away before he spoke.
"It was all that I could save, ml*
padre. You had told me that you loved
the picture, no? The cross is but this
bit of metal." He held out a dark mass
of melted lead and gold. "But the plc
ture will make a new altar. We can.
build a new altar forjthe blessed moth
er and her child."

on the belfry steps, almost as unmind
ful cf the passing day. But his thoughts
were net Ml*. He was waging a mad,
wordless batge with Fate, reviewing
the long resultless years, rebelling
against the long empty years to come.
In bia consecration to the church he
bad dreamed of place and power, place
axaozur People, power In the world. And
be had found *only Isolation and ob
livion, only a score of Indian worship
ers, with two score Indian boys. It
xtum a cne-clded battle, fought for the
thousandth time, and Fate would win
as she always had.
The shadow of the belfry cross was
creeping slowly down the belfry roof.
Padre Antonio knew that he soon would
hear the bell that would summon his
congregation. Even before he heard Its
sound his nerves shivered In anticipa
tion of its cracked, harsh note, even
before he saw the congregation his soul
withdrew from the empty, sordid faces
It would find there. If he bad made
but one step of progress! If he could
but see one glimmer of consciousness
of aught else save gratitude for creat
ure comfort!
Padre Antonio's head was bowed low
over his desk, when louder, harsher
than ever before the bell clanged its
discords. A deep groan from the
padre's lips was Its echo. For this
broken bell had grown to be the ex
pression In his mind of his own broken
life. Again and again in hurried meas
ure the bell clashed and clamored. A
But even while the Indolent, half
rren eye" watched for the shadow of
the cross they rested with indolent,
half-awakened curiosity on a spot far
cut under the eaves. It was not a long
crimson lizard. Pedro knew all the
lizards for miles about and not one of
them was that color. It was not a but
terfly caught In the leathern thongs
that held the beams, not a blossom
blown there by the wind, not a red
winged blackbird retting from Its labor
of mercy.
Suddenly a long, red tongue flashed
high Into the air and Pedro knew that
It was fixe! Fire under the eaves! Fire
bursting froea the roof of the sacristy!
Fire enveloping the wooden Joists 1 Fire
and not a drop cf water! Fire and no
one but Father Antonio and him to
fight It!
Ah! But he, be could mcunon them,

Stretched at full length on the belfry
steps was Pedro, the padre's boy, half
In the shadow, half in the sunlight* Bo
long had he been there motionless that
a brown lizard was sleeping on his
naked foot, unmindful that the hot flesh
Â¦was not an Integral part of the hot
bricks.
Pedro rras not asleep, neither was he
atvake. With indolent, half open eyes
he was watching for the shadow of the
crops on the ground outside the belfry
door. "When the shadow appeared it
would be time to ring the bell that
csl'.ed the handful of natives from their
hot. Fun-bnked hovels to worship on the
cool flags of the mission chancel. This
was the one labor of the day that Pedro
loved. He neither knew nor cared that
the bell was cracked, that It sent forth,
over the vaJley. a tuneless
sound. He knew only that it was noise,
lawful, permissible noise and this he
loved. And he loved, too. his own Im
portance in the act. Was It not he that
summoned the lagging worshipers? If
he did not ring the bell could even
Padre Antonio, himself, call his congre
gation to hear the services In the mis
sion?
He raised his hand to give them the
blessing of the church before he spoke
his own personal words when sudden
ly, floating down from the new belfry
tower came a note clear, pure, sweet
and true. Tenderly, softly It called.
again and again, symbolizing the love
that had answered the padre's prayers
not in his own way, but in the way of
the Father whom he served.
Pedro led them, but he did not speak
until all were gathered about the pa
dre. Then, acting as Interpreter and
spokesman for the others, he ex
plained.
The padre had told them that In
some places, on Christmas day, friends
gave presents to each other; the padre
had told them that when the Christ
child was born all brought presents to
him. Now, that the new chapel was
so nearly finished, was It not light that
they should bring gifts to the chapel?
But because they loved the padre they
wanted first to give gifts to him that
he might give them to the church.
Slowly, one by one, the Indians
brought their offerings and laid them
at the padre's feet; a rough cross,
carved from a mad rone tree; a prayer
desk, cut from the same wood; a foot
stool and candlesticks, all shaped with
Infinite patience; white cloths for the
altar, coarse and rough, but woven and
Interwoven with love. Something each
one brought, each one save Pedro, and
Pedro himself had disappeared from
the group.
For Pedro had found the ben not
only uninjured, but made perfect and
whole In the fierce flames that had an
nealed the crack In Its bronze side, and
Pedro's gift to the padre, Pedro's gift
to the chapel was the bell that, quite
unknown to the padre, had been hung
In the belfry tower. " \
Overcome by his own â¢motion. Padre
Antonio stood illtnt for a moment.
Had not love won? Was cot love tri
umphant? Was It not their lore for
him that made them rescue him from
the burning church? Was It not' their
love for him that made them bring
their offerings to the new mission?
Would It be hard to bring them,
through this love, to the loving heart
of the church?
"That you have my sympathy, be
lieve me, my dear son," the latter ran,
"but I know that In refusing you your
request I am granting: you your desire.
Tou tell me that you have won no souls
to your church. Have you won them
'to yourself? Have you thought of the
limitations of the people you are work-
Ing for 7 Have you thought of their
lives and opportunities? "Win them to

the church through the same love. For
love Is supreme. Love Is sJl powerful.
Love reigns over all human life and
passion." There were pages of close.
fin* writing â pages that seemed to An
tonio like senseless platitudes, and the
letter ended with the words: Â°I am not
writing to you as your superior. I have
not placed your application with the
church authorities. I am writing to
you as If you . were my own son. to
shield you from a lifetime of regret for
& duty shirked.**
The letter lay on the padre's knees
as he sat In the door of his hut looking
down toward the new mission building.
It was nearly finished; already Its soft,
creamy walls rose high and straight;
already the arches were supporting
patches of thatched roof. Here and
there on the ground squatted groups of
brow-n figures, all looking more or less
Indolently at the result of their labors.
But of what use was any of It? "What
did any of them gain from It? What
did It mean to any of them except easy
flour, easy warmth, easy existence?
As these bitter thoughts were passing
through the padre's mind he saw that
the groups of figures were rlstng to
their feetâ that they were gathering to
gether In one mass, that they were
coming toward him. He glanced at the
shadows to see If It was already time
for the morning service, but It was not,
and a faint wonder crossed his mind.
Had they some request to make of
him? Cztra. fruit, extra flour, extra
wine?:- i
But there was no Christmas Jot In
Padre Antonio's heart. His superior's
letter lay before him and It offered no
release â no return to the world of place
and power. _ .

to leave the school and run away from

England was striving with other na
tions to crush out the growing power of
Napoleon, and as Jack read an old
paper lnÂ» found on the eeat he became
greatly interested in the accounts of
how England's best eons had given
their all for their country, and made
up his mind to enlist as a drummer
boy. As the coach at length drew near
the room a few minutes later and was
astonished to find the offertory so
small. He hurriedly called the vicar,
and the two quickly discovered that the
greater part of the money was n&t
there, Although both hated to admit
It, suspicion pointed to Jack, he having
been the only one who handled the
basin. He was sent for In the evening
and closely questioned, and although
the vicar tried in every way to conceal
his suspicions, the boy soon saw
through their careful questioning and
stoutly asserted his innocence. His
pride was terribly wounded at the idea
that his superiors could ever suspect
him of dishonesty. .
It preyed on his mind for two or
school a dark cloud gathered. After
each service m the cathedral It was
Jack's duty to carry the alms basin
downstairs to thÂ« sacristy. It was au
tumn and the yellow fields had yielded
their good measure of golden store,
A harvest festival of praise and
thanksgiving had been held in the ca
thedral and the vicar had made an elo
quent appeal for a liberal contribution
from his congregation in aid of the
poor of the diocese. When the service
was over the response was found to
have been very generous.
Jack, as had been his custom, carried
ths alms basin to the sacristy, and
then went to the choir room to remove
his vestments. The treasurer entered
me to take action Immediately. Mr.
Wickes was here to-day and we had a
long talk on the subject. He has been
a good, kind friend, and tells me he

Over the sunshine of his life In the
TIIB little do* sled tolled slowly
orer the soft snow and gradually
grew near the edge of the dense
woods situated close to a little
Tillage In Nottingham. Its
heavy load of wood burled the runners
deep and the lad who trudged along
side would occasionally speak a few
words to the faithful animal who had
so long been his companion in his Jour
neys through the forest.
.â¢ Jack Kemble was deep fn thought
over the many things Miss Brown had
told him the night before as they had
watched the dying embers on the old
hearth In Red Cottage. Times had been
hard this winter, and as Jack urged
Major . forward again after a brief
stop his mind pictured the little mis
tress of Red Cottage waiting for his
return' and he wondered If she had
been able to secure the assistance she
had requested from Mr. Ashcrbft, her
relative in America.
"Come on, 'Maje'; well- soon be
there." As he spoke he put his toot
behind the sled and started It. v - \ 'Â¦
That. night. Miss Brown did not eat
much supper, as her thoughts were
busy over the letter she had received
the preceding day from her London so
licitor, telling her that Tie had lost her
case in the High Court of Appeal and
that the mortgage on her property
there would W foreclosed. With her
source of income thus cut off. she had
written to Ashcroft in New York, and
had also conllded her financial trou
bles to Ilev. Mr. Wickes, the curate.
The responsibility of Jack's education
was worrying tier.
After supper the two sat for some
time Quietly talking. She felt a great
heskancy in telling him of the conver
sation she had with Mr. Wickes. After
discussing many phases of his plan*
for their future, she drew closer to the.
boy. v
"Jack, It Is getting near the ttoe
when you will have to make your own
way. In the world, and I think It only
rtght that you should know many
things concerning your past history Â©t
which I have never spoken before.
; "About ten years ago a small sleigh
stopped at the door of Rod Cottar* and
a stranger alighted, carrying through
the heavy Â«now a small boy. The ;.
stranger said he had heard of me
through an old friend In Amnrtca, Will
iam Ashcroft. I told him that he m
nay cousin, that to knew little of on*
another, not having seen each other
for many years.
"The stranger told me further that
he was' a seafaring man and was on a
business trip to .England. As It' was
so far to ; the next town and the , hoar
was late, he said he would be greatly
obliged if I could give him "shelter for
the night. >
"The request was so unusual that I
hesitated for a. moment and, quickly
perceiving this, he said he would
recompense me liberally. I said that
I was not thinking of thatâ only of my
poor accommodations. â¢ . -
"He answered with a smile that hum
ble fare was good enough for a sailor.
''The child looked so cold and hungry
I had not the heart to send them out

be content with what plain hospitality
I could offer that he was welcome, Be

"It read. 'John Kemble, British ship

"Yes, lad, you were named after your

"You are not my auntie, after all,"
said -Jack, somewhat sorrowfully." 1 /
"No, lad, except In spirit"
."You had been with me about a year
when he went off on a trip, and whea
he did not return I made inquiries and
the only thing I. could learn was that
It was thought his ship had foundered
at sea with all souls.
"I wrote to Ashcroft to find out. If
possible, some clew to his family, and
received an answer stating that the
captain had told him very little con
cerning his personal affairs, except to
say that he had disagreed with his
wife, and had taken his child and em
barked on a foreign ship.
"He left a few pieces of Jewelry with
Achcroft, one of which he sent me,
thinking It might help roe in my search.
I have k al ways carried it with me, lad,
for fear of losing it, but think you are
old enough now to appreciate its
value."
6he took a small plush box from her
pocket and opened It. Jack's eyes were
wide with curiosity and he leaned over
Miss Brown and looked eagerly at the
features.
"Who is it?" he asked.
"Ashcroft tells me it Is your mother's
likeness."
'My mother/' he exclaimed with awe
and rapture.
"Yes, my boy, I have often studied
that face and wondered how great
would be her Joy If she could only see
her boy again."

question.
"From all I can learn, she Is, Jack,
but as to where your father lived be

8am was raging mad virtly because
he recognized his own meanness. Upon
Tom there flashed thÂ« thought of his
pledge I and he fought in an agony of ,
distress and shame.- The black eye and
the tofn'coat were nothing to the re
morse which filled his mind as the face
of the little Lord .came back to him
with eyes' of sorrow. He was pledged
to peace and the very first day had:
brought a fight, even though It was
in defense of the right.. "The servant
of the Lord must not strive, but be
gentle toward all."
To the teacher's questions he had no
reply, as he could not tell her the reas
on for his onslausrht. Â¦ So he was wsnt
to the, principal. and received his pun
ishment for beginning a fight upon the.
school grounds. And Bam was taunt
ingly happy 'over the outcome.
After.' school Tom rushed ; home ~ and
up to bis .room. ".Ho" turned the picture
with its face to the wall, threw himself
upon his bed and the tears burst forth.

It wns a very quiet boy that walked
home with mother that night from ser
vice. Perhaps mother understood. Cer
tainly when he bade her good night
and whispered,- "I'm going ,to , try,
mother." her tactful answer was a
sympathetic kiss and one of those
mother looks which every boy under
stands.
A funny thing happened that night.*
At the foot of Tom's bed hung a fine
copy of Bo-uguereau's picture. * "Our
Lady of the Angels." The last thing
lhat Tom saw as he dropped to sleep
was the appealing eyes and. outstretch
ed hands of the boy Jesus in his
mother's arms. During the night the
little fellow In the picture stepped soft
ly down from the frame and. out upon
the bed. He held out his hands to
Tom, who, with full heart and over
flowing love,. took him up and held him
close to 'his own bosom. Again with
all the earnestness of his youthful ar
dor and this time to the Christ child
himself, Tom said. "I'll do it."
It may have been only a dream, but
it was very real. to Tom as he opened
his eyes upon the picture in the morn-
could have told you so while ehe kept
her weather eye open for her persecu
tor.
But while Tom loved fun he was also
fearless when truth was concerned. For
his principles he would go through fire
and water. He had the hero 6tuff in
him. although it was not often over
worked.
That was the hapirtest morning I of
Tom's life. Love to everybody was
shining out of those deep, brown eyes.
Wings were there instead of feet as
the boy took his way to school, where
all the morning > hours were Joy. Af
ter lunch Tom again started for school
Half way down the block he overtook
Sam Mack. ' Now Sam was not Just
the kind of boy that" Tom "liked, but
as they only , lived three " doors apart
they were thrown much together, al
though they were not In the game
grades at school. 8am had a new story
to tell which he had heard upon the
street the evening before. As Tom lis
tened his heart stood still, for Sam,
whose home knew no religion, was Unk
ing an evil story with the sacred name.
A swift vision of the pure eyes of the
little "Immanuel" came before Tom's
mind. As Bam ended the vile tale with
an Impure suggestion the rising, indig
nation In Totn'a breast flamed forth
and something hit 8ani squarely be
tween the eyes and over he went upon
the grass, choking with rage. It was
no light blow and 8am was no light
antagonist. There was a lively two
minutes before one of the teachers
could be summoned and the bout end
ed. But the effects were awful. Sam's
nose and scratched cheek were leaking
gore, and Tom, with torn coat and

season was the collecting: ef street caT
transfers. . Every boy , -was a oaneotor
and Interest ran high.' Bach aimed to
ret a complete ' set of the forty-nine
different kinds issued by the city lines.
One Friday afternoon John Belden was
triumphant with the whole set. The
last and most difficult one to secure
was the Railroad-avenue transfer. Few
people traveled over that short termi
nal line away down beyond "Butcher
town'! and those who did so required
their transfers to get to the dry. Tom
had all but this one. Be was bound to
have them all.
.' On Saturday he was sent downtown
on an . errand and given two nickels
for car fare. . Instead of riding he
walked down, did his errand and board

looked 'out from his frame and Tom's
heart was at peace. , .â¢; ,
. , Next, morning Tom Celt a new km/I
of happiness; within him. He had
fought another fight, this ttana wtth
himself. What was the right ostxrse ta
take with Bam? Should he apologise
for BtrUdbog Mm? XT be did Bam might
continue his* evil stories. * Tom could
see but one right way and, although a
very disagreeable, one, he resolved to
take It. Seeing Sam in the midst of a
group of boys he walked up with out
stretohed hand and said: "I am sorry
I struck you yesterday, Sam, but I
don't want you ever to tell me any
more dirty stories." One of the other
boys said, with a laugh: "Well, there's
no danger, Tom, If you are going to
listen to them with your fists.'.' -
Saturday was the great football game
between the Bryants, and the Broder-
Icks. AH the boys went and the'ears
were crowded with friends and parents."
Bam and Tom happened to be on the
same car. In the 'crowd the conductor
did not see them and Bam with a wink
put his nickel back Into his pocket For
the second time he saw the lightning
in " Tom's eye and scorn and contempt
were with It. With some difficulty Tom
C Â£ \ *LL do It." Tom Jumped In his
I seat as something within him
I seemed to Epeak these words
like a foghorn. He looked
around, expecting to find everybody
razing at him, but not an ear had
heard and not an eye wm looking.
It was at the Christina* service, and
the boy was quite carried out of him
self. A first-class Christmas dinner
was filling his stomach with satisfying
content. Shining lights and beautiful
decorations mad? a scene of delightful
harmony. It almost seemed as if the
music must have come from heaven.
Over the pulpit In glowing letters was
the word "Immanuel." which seemed
to be the center of all the service of
the evening. Tom wondered what It
meant and was glad when the preacher
In simple story told of the little Lord
jÂ«ttÂ« who came to earth on Christmas
gay. "Immanuer* was the name given
to him before be was born. "God with
cs" was its meaning, and very tenderly
did the speaker tell of the loving spirit
which brought Jesus from glory to
earth to bring peace to all men.
As the Etory went on Tom realized
for the first time that it was a real babe
that was born at Bethlehem, a real boy
that grew up in Nazareth. Something
of what ths boy life of the Savior must
have been appealed to the listener, and
Tom understood a little of the match
less grace of the boy Jesus as lie went
to the rabbi's school or helped his fath
er In the carpenter's ehop. But what
would Jesus do if he went to IDA Bry
ant school on Geary street, and what
would the Bryant boys say if Jesus
should really eppear with his books
next Monday?
Tom listened with all his ears to the
word-picture of a boy who never
stooped to meanness and who always
lived the truth. Could a fellow be such
a boy as that and go to the Bryant?
Guess not; but why rot? The Bryant
boys needed Just such an example as
Jecus v.-ould be. Then the speaker said
that It was possible for every one so
to copy the life cf Jesus that the world
might 6ee how noble a clean, true life
could be. He closed with a loving ap
peal to every one present to live as
Jesus did and help others to do likewise.
Bo deep an impression did the service
tnske upon Tom, curled up in the cush
ioned pew. that almost without thought
all the chivalry in the boy was roused,
and those impulsive wordB, "I'll do It!"
were the pledge of Tom's . nobler and
better nature to do the will of Christ.
Now. Tom was no angel. That
Christmas dinner was about the only
thing that could have kept him quiet
so long at ence. He was Just an ordi
nary city boy of 12. only with a little
more of mischief than even the average
lad. He was frank and sturdy and had
clear brown eyes which could look you
steadily in the face and never waver.
He was a leader, too. Whether mis
chief or ploy was on deck. Tom was
sure to be in it. When Madam Crosby,
who had a special spite against boys,
scolded the milkman roundly for the
quart of chalk and water which Ehe
found one moraine at her door, per*
haps Tom could have told where a part,
at least, of the stolen milk had gone.
When old Maid Munsey's pet pug came
tearing home Insane with the torture
cf a couple of dozen extra fleas under

wasn't Tom who had engineered the
capture of those frisky torments. No;

Tom was a trifle late on Monday and
the last bell rani Just as he entered
tie schoolyard. All the boys were In
before him. John Bolden was tÂ£e last
to eater. He had been showing bis
transfers to the boys and as, .the bell

Bam was passing through the halls
to his 'own room as the two boys en

Sam's chanceâ â¢> chance to complete his

he went out to get them. They were

had rone out or la. There could be
no mistake. It wm a clear case. Oe
mff to the teacher, he told of his loss
and accused Tom of the theft. The
teacher called Tom, and he, of course,
denied all knowledge of the matter.

"IMMANUEL"
7was on theOxus. - In course of time
they spread to the regions south and
southwest of the Caspian Sea. Here
they came in contact with a people
whose religion was very similar to
their own. This people inhabited Ar
menia, Cappadoda and the Zagros
Mountains. Associated with their re
ligious tenets was a priest caste of a
highly sacerdotal character. - j These
priests claimed prophetic powers, in
this- corresponding very much to the
Israelites. Their religion, too, was
monotheistic; but the four elements,
fire, air, earth, water, were specially
recognized as proper objects of human
reverence. ' Fire as the most subtle
and ethereal principle, as well as the
most potent agent, was given especial
veneration. The Zoroastrians came in
contact with this people.and as the
fundamental tenets of both religions
were much alike, they Â¦ readily coal
esced. Ths Iranians incorporated the
principal dogmas of belief and adopted
the. most -characteristic religious
ucagps of these people, whilst they
took over bodily their priesthood. The
priests were the magi arid their relig
ion magism. As the fusion took. place
in Media the Magiana subsequently be
came known as a Median tribe. (Raw
linson.) But originally they were lin
guistically and racially distinct from
Medes and Persians. In fact, their
language was-" Turanian, their race
Scythian; they were descendants of
Magog/.' '
- Before and after their amalgamation
with the Iranians they held an exalted
position. They had neither temples,
shrines; nor Images. -They were; not
idolaters like so many of . the nations
around. them. .Thejr had altars, howev
er, and on these the perpetual fire, kin
dled, It was believed. -by a flame from
heaven, was kept alight continually.
To blow the breath upon the flame was
considered . a â¢ defilement- of ' the : . altar,
and so heinous as to be regarded a can,
ital offend -' . ': Â¦ "; V
: But beautiful as U. the theory, Blbll- ,
cal conditions compel us to; reject it.
Christ's birth took place, according to
SL Paul, In "the fullness of time."
This fullness of time is an astronomi
cal : expression - meaning the com.ple- j
tion of a cycle, or the revolution of a
sphere in its orbit That cycle, or revo-
lution, occupied thousands of years In
its completion.- 'As we have?-' seen, the.
Star of, Bethlehem had a, periodic time,
which must necessarily 'have corre-"
sponded with "the. fullness.. of time."'
But the periodic times of Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn are all known and are of short,
duration. Even if we apply. the periodic
time to the conjunctions of- the .Â«lÂ»iiitt ".
the objection .still ':_ holds,.- good.; "The
times of the conjunctions Â¦:. are . -known \
and are comparatively . short; > So that I
attractive as is . the â¢ theory of Kepler,
we must dismiss it and look jslsÂ«where.
There Is one star, which fulfills all
the conditions, (a) It was in an especial
sense the Magi's star, (b) . It has a pe-'
rlodlc time., .(c) Its revolution Is of In- !
definite length. . (d) It -was in the sign'
Pisces at the birth of our Lord, (e) I .
believe we can find a /peculiarity > v
which It could be called "Hls\.Star."
That star was Sirlus," the ' brightest ' in ,.
the firmament heaven. :.-
Before we can arrive at out final con
clusion it is necessary, to learn some
thing about . the . wise j men,-,., or - Magi. .
Who were the Magi? Â¦Â¦ Where' did, they
come from ?.;.Â¦;*Â¦ â¢ ;..,"'Â¦ .'- - Â¦'
; The etymology of the word Magi . Is
involved \ in much' doubt.' It is \ gener
ally supposed to be primarily a Persian
word, but the Persian' is 'only' a-fonn |
of the original. % Our. word Magus, of ;
which Magi- Is. the I plural,'^ iÂ» but the'
Latin renderin g of .the '; Greek '. . Magos, i
the Persian of which Is probably Maz.
Maz is cognate to MaJ In major, Mag in
Magnus and* Meg In Â¦ Megas g (Rawlln
son).' "It-is an intensitive and means ;
much or all." j In Ahura-Maz-da, . Per- j
sian name ,' f or God, It 'Â¦ xneana , the all
wlse or all-powerfuL '
It Is clear, however, that the Persians
borrowed the word, as they assimilated
the priesthood from jthe Medians and
the Medians received it . from the Ac
cadians, who inhabited.- r the country
afterward called Babylonia. The Ac
cadlans were the "Highlanders who
descended from the mountainous re
gion of Elam." (Sayce). To them the
Assyrians ascribed the origin of Chal
deau civilization j and writing. Their
language' is caljed Turanian. Turanian
differs from both the Aryan and Semi
tic languages, arfd Is "used especially
or restricledly , of , the Ural-Altaic, or
Scythian .languages." (Century Dic
?'^nary). *
Thus we trace the term Magus' to the
Accadlans, whose language Is Turanian
or Scythian. The home of the language
and race of the Magi is Scythla. If we
now turn to Jer.. xxxlx., 3, we shall find
an officer of Nebuchadneszer designa
ted Rab-Mag. "Rab means chief; Mag
means . Magian; the' chief Magian. or
high priest. We again locate the magi
In Babylon.' Go back many centuries
to Gen. x., 2, and we read that the
second son of Japhet was Magog, or as
we may write It, Maggog. The Scyth
ians claim to have descended from
Mag-gog. Â¦. Josephus . states . that the
Grecians, called the Scythians Magogi
in his day. We have thus traced his
torically and phllologlcally the Maglans
to 'Scythla, .

It was an angelic apparition. No doubt
angels were sent on messages from
heaven to men, and the Angel Gabriel
was used in the annunciation. But
the angelic - vision would disappear
with the accomplishment of the object.
Not so the star; It remained.
II. The star was not a meteor. This
view has been largely held. It is as
serted that some kind of meteoric
phenomenon would best meet the ne
cessitiesof the case. : But any meteor
drawn to the earth would either bo
consumed by the atmospheric friction
or else, would fall ip the ground and
become extinguished. Its appearance
would be . almost momentary.
III. The star was not a comet. Ona
of the greatest fathers of the church,
Orlgen, held this view. But not all
the weight of Origeh's great scholar
ship, could obtain credence for such a
belief. Just recently this theory of a
comet has been revived, unconsciously,
however, that Orlgen was the father
of it.
IV. The star was not a conjunction
of planets. This is the mest feasible
as well as fascinating, theory. It is
that of the great astronomer, Kepler.
He calculated that there was a con-
Junction of Mars, and Jupiter on the
night of December 25, ; ln_ the j year of
Rome 747. Next year Saturn Joined
Mars and Jupiter, according to ; Dean
Alford, the eminent- commentator, the
light of. the three planets blended and
appeared. to the beholder as one light.
What a beautiful Illustration of trinity
in unityâ the lights of three, planets
blended Into one light! â¢ Ideler, con
firmed Â¦ Kepler's ; calculation .. as to the
conjunction- of the . planets. Wleseler,
who followed, makes the conjunction
in A.' U..C/ 750.' the. year of the! nativ
ity.' now' agreed upon by the. learned.
It Is remarkablei too, that the conjunc
tion" of . the planets topic place In ths
sign - Pisces, the sign of Ju,dea. ; This
theory is also free from the objections
above referred to 1 . .
Now, in the Bible star is -used only
In a twofold signification â literally or
figuratively. In its figurative sense it
means a king or other- civil ruler, an
ecclesiastical teacher, and perhaps an
angel. It is not used in its metaphor
ical sense here. Therefore it means
a reel star.
2. It was a star in motion, It
changed its position in the heavens.
Motion is characteristic of all the
heavenly bodies, and the words of
the sacred narrative are: "The star
went before them till it came." When
..ilrst they caw the star it occupied a
particular cpot In the sky. Now, how
ever, it has a' different position, not
relatively because of the change in the
field of observation, but absolutely by
{change of location in the heavens. No
* doubt the motion was a movement in
its orbit. This will appear more plain
ly from our next proposition.'
3. It was a star that had an aster
stice â it stood at a particular point In
the Eky above them. The statement is
very distinct: "It came and stood
over where the young child was." The
word in the original is "este," from
Istemi; the Latin equivalent of which
Is stare, to stand. Joined with Sol
(the sun) it forms solstice, an astro
nomical term applied to two positions
In the heavens, called the summer and
ti inter solstices. At these points the
sun stands for a few moments before
entering upon his return Journey. In
the same way the star stood on the
meridian passing through Bethlehem,
which marks it as the true first meri
dian of the world
4. It was a star that moved In an
orbitâ it had a periodic time. This
Is a roost remarkable statement. We
are told that Herod privately, learned
CT^HE Star of Bethlehem I? a theme
I of wondrous power. It has fasci-
I nated sages cf the East and
JL philosophers of the West. It has
been discussed these 1900 years by men
of varying minds with a freshness that
never falls. It excites a glow cf fervid
Jove in the breast of the saint It
kindles the dying embers of hope in
the soul of the sinner. It is the ray of
heaven's own light to the afflicted. It
beckons the prodigal back to the
Father's home. It gives strength to
the living. It brings peace to the dying.
But though a mystery of awe to
angels, it is a symbol of love divine to
men. As such it cannot fail to pro
foundly interest every intelligent in
quirer after truth. That we may the
better understand the subject ami
more thoroughly appreciate the ways
of God with man, I propose . to treat
the subject under the following heads:
1. The star was a real, true, bona
fide Etsrâ not a mere temporary mir
aculous creation for the epeclfio pur
pose. This, however, is the conten
tion cf many very learned theologians.
Three considerations will show the un
soundness of such views.
First â God never works a miracle
except by natural law and through
natural phenomena, when such exist.
When he created life it was through
the media of existing elements already
in the waters. When he divided the
"Red Sea for the Israelites to pass
through it was by means of a strong
east wind, so piercingly cold as to
freeze the waters on either Bide. These
Instances will suffice, although many
others could be adduced. It follows,
therefore, that God mad* use of the
existing stars to announce the nativity
to the wise men.
Second â It is allowed on all hands
that the magi, or wise men, were
learned. They would, therefore, make
use of words and terms with discrim
ination. But not only were they
learned, they were astronomers.
Hence, when they used a.n astronomi
cal term, they would use the appro
priate word or phrase descriptive of
the object referred to. They use the
word "aster," which means an ordin
ary and permanent star, not an ex
traordinary and temporary one.
Third â The other words and
phrases employed by the evangelist in
writing about the star are astronomi
cal terms, from which we conclude
that aster was used In Its ordinary as
tronomical sense.
-Taay offered neriflu alao. TaÂ» *â¢Â»Â¦

â¢r fountain, where it wu slain by en*
of the priests with the utmost care,
lest any of the blood should defile the
water. A small portion of the fat wu
consumed In the flame of the altar.
The flesh became the portion of the
priests, upon which they banqnstea
.when the rites were finished.
The magi claimed supernatural
powers as well aa the gift of prophecy.
They Interpreted dreams, cxplainÂ«6
omens and expounded mysterlM. To
their high pretensions they added a
lofty dignity and majestic mein. Their
vestiture was chaste, their, ceremonial
magnificent. Clad In long white flow
ing robes, wearing tall felt hats, with
lappets at the side, and carrying thÂ«
barsom, made of their tamarisk twigs.
In their hands, they chanted mystlo
strains at the sacrifices and as they
poured the propitiatory libation of oil,
milk and honey on the ground, they
presented an Imposing spectacle ta
their Impressive ritual.
Added to this T.-aa their great learn
ing, deep piety and unaffected sano
tity. No wonder then that they wer*
an all powerful priestly casto in some
of the western nations and became
equally so among the . Iranians and
other eastern people. The Persians,
becoming the leading nation of the
world, the magi came to be regarded
as indigenous to the empire. Hence
the general mistake that the :na.;i
were confined to the Persian priest
hood. It was, however, the kin and
co-religionists of the Persian priest*
fcood that, standing by their fire al
tars and looking toward the eastern
sky. beheld afar the wondrous star â j
the star of Bethlehem. '
These men were neither Arabian
Kings, Persian priests, nor Oriental
sages. On the contrary, they were
Keltsâ Irish Druids. Their homes were
In the west and their chief sanctuaries
In the western Isles.
Is there a people on the fac* of the
earth whose history fits in with the
conditions necesary to determine who
the Magi were, and whence they
came?
There is one race, and oatr one,
whose history meets all thÂ« require
ments. That race la the Irlah â¢Â»
Gaelic
The Irish claim to be descended
from Magog, the grandson of Noah.
They originally came from Seythla.
Their language belongs to the Bcythio
tongue or stock of languages, which
connects them with the ancient Ac
cadlans. This Is the same stock and
race to which we traced the Magi.
The original country of the Magi and
Gael is. the same.
It Is well known that the Irish wcr*
some centuries ago known as Scots.
Bcot comes from Scult, and this U the
Irish for Scythia.
In the seventh century before Christ
the Greeks came in contact with a
race "whom they called Scythians. An
ezacter form of the name waa Scolotl.
Herodotus and Hippocrates dearly
distinguish the Seolots. or true Scythi
ans, from all their neighbors." (En
cyclopedia Britannlca.) It win bo aeea
nt a glance that Sco(lo)ts Is but a dif
ferent linguistic way of spelling Scot
or Scult.
A tribe of the Irish that kÂ»r>t up
communication with thÂ» true Bcythi
ans and other Gaelic tribes in Greece
and Asia Minor was the Tuatha, da
Danan. Tuatha de Danan means
"tribes of Dia and Anah." according to
Professor Sullivan. These are the
sky and sea gods of Accad. Air and
water were two of the four principles
held In especial veneration by the
Magians whom we traced to Accad
and Scythia.
Again the Tuatha de Danan were of
"the race Ibath. grandson of Iarbonei
the prophet, son of Nemed." To these
Danans especially the term Slaglan is
applied In the- ancient Irish annals.
The power of enchantment, interpreta
tion of dreams, working of miracles,
the gift of prophecy and great learning
are attributed to their priests or
Druids. It was th!3 tribe that brought
the atone of Scone, now In Westmin
ster Abbey, to Ireland. On this stone
Edward VII xvas recently crowned.
The Scottish Kings, and before them
the Irish Kings, were crowned on tha
same stone.
The Irish wdrd Druid means wisdom
or Magian. It is worthy of record that
the Irish Scriptures render "there came
wise men from the east" by "there
came Druids from the east." The Irish
words are: "Draioch o naird sholr go
Hlerusalem." which shows the Irish be
lief that the Druids were Magians.
It is a matter of history that part of
the Gaels or Irish In the westward
movement of the race returned by the
valley of the Danube and settled la
Asia Minor. They prefixed their own
name to Asia, and called their abode
Gael- Asia, or Galatla, as It came to be
spelled.
Whether the Druids or Magi' to
whom the star of Bethlehem appeared
were* residents of Ireland, Scythia or
Galatla is Immaterial, for they wire
all the same Gaellb race.
I. . The star was not an angel. No
less a father of the church than Theo
phyiact held this view. He believed
The word qualifying star, phtlnome
non (appearing), is better rendered b'y
the expression "light-giving:." and
means that the light was Inherent in
the star itself; in other words, the star
was a sun. The expressions used arÂ«
euch as could not be applied to a tem
porarily luminous object.
5. It was a star that had a relative
position in; the sky â it was in'the east.
Assuming that the direct rendering of
anatole is .; "In,: the east," then It has
reference to that particular part of the
heavens to the east of the observer.
The observers, therefore, must have
been west of Jerusalem. Th!s Is a point
to be borne in mind, as we shall have
to refer to It^ more particularly later
on. The conclusion here arrived at Is
contrary t<3 the generally received opin
ion. As far as I am aware it Is uni
versally held that the Magi were resi
dent or located In the east at the time
the star appeared to them. Yet accord
ing to the;$ain terms of the statement
they must j have been located In â¢ the
â¢nest. Anatole; means (1) the rising of
the heavenly bodies from the horizon:
(2) the dawn' or daysprlng; (3) the east
or orient. Whichever meaning' you
adop.t, the beholder must have' been
west of the star. The star must have
pointed to or been at Jerusalem when
first observed by the wise men. There
fore the wise men must have been
west of Jerusalem.
6. It was a fired starâ not erratle
in its movements. The term "star" was
used by the wise men. But they were
skilled astronomers and knew the dif
ference between a star, a planet, a
comet or a meteor, for all of which
there were distinct names. Hence
planet, comet,. meteor are ruled out by
the word aster (star). And hence wa
conclude that the star in the east was
a fixed star. '{Â¦Â¦/Â¦:: Â¦-*;
But assume that it was the evange
list who used the word aster. We still
must conclude that it was a fixed star.
In the days of the apostles the differ
ent kinds of heavenly bodies had dls-,
tlnctive names. They are to be found
in Josephus, the Je-xlsh historian, and
St Jude distinguishes a planet from
Â«. Btar Jude 13)â aster planets (wan
dering stars). Had it been other than
a fixed star the evangelist would have
stated so.
7. It was a star In the sign plsces
of the zodiacâ the sign of Judea. This
Is an important factor. Among the
ancients there was a part of the heav
ens called the zodiac. " It was a belt
encircling the heavens on each side of
the ecliptic, or apparent path of the
Bun among the stars, within which the
larsrer planets always remain. It ex
tended to eight degrees" on cither side
of the ecliptic It was divided into
twelve parts called the Signs â¢ of the
Zodiac The different countries of the
earth were divided among the twelve
signs. Judea belonged â¢ to the sign.
Pisces, the twelfth. The Magi, like all
other astrologers or astronomers, be
lieved In the -division. It may be as
well to answer an objection here. It
is that astrology being a false science,
God could not make use of it in the
accomplishing, of his designs. But this
is to object to what God actually did.
If he used a false prophet to disclose
his will surely he would reveal that
will through a false science. It was
not to teach science that God gave his
revelation. He therefore used the
prophet .Balaam, in all probability one
of the old Magi. As Gerlach well says
in his commentary, "As Jesus adapted
himself to fishermen by a .miraculous
draught of fishes; to the sick by curing
of their infirmities,' and to all his hear
ers by his parables relating to the cir
cumstances around them, so- did he
draw the astronomlsts to himself by
condescending to -their- favorite- sci
ence." The star â¢ of Bethlehem must
be connected with the sign of plsces..
So far we have traced some of the
necessary conditions of the star. Let
us now try and discover the star that
f ulfljls these conditions. In ' doing so
we < shall briefly discuss the different
theories put forth and held by differ
ent people, some of them men of great
eminence in their own particular
sphere. We shall also show the. un
tenableness of the different hypothe
ses: â¢ Â¦ ....
of the UtEl "what time
the star appeared." The
margin of the Revised Ver
sion gives us a better be
cause a more correct trans
lation of the phrase. It Is:
"The time of the star that
appeared." But the lit
eral rendering: Is "the time
of the appearing star."
There are two words In
Greek for time, kalros and
rhronos. Kalro* means
a fixed time of definite
lepgth, euch as a season, a
â¢ number of known years,
etc But chronos Is the
Â¦word for Indefinite time, as
a. period whose number of
years Is not known. Yet
ilt Is not the equivalent of;
eternal; It has a beginning
and ending; there Is an
initial starting point and
completion at the same
point, as In the case of a
circle, cycle or orbit. The
wprd which Herod uses, no
doubt quoting the magi's
expression, is chronos, the
Indefinite period.

Sempland been as -wise as he was brave.
Perhaps he wasn't quite master of him
self on- account of his experience in
war, and his lack of it in women, for
he instantly conceived that her hesita
tion was due to some other cause than
maidenly incertitude, and that Harry
Lacy, of whom he had grown mightily
jealous, was at the bottom of it.
He hated and envied Lacy, More, he
despised him for. his weaknesses and
their consequences. The two had been
great friends once, but a year or two
before the outbreak of the* war they
had drifted apart.
Sempland did not envy Lacy any tal
ents that he might possess, for he waa
quite confident that the only thing he
himself lacked had been opportunity-
Fate had not been kind to him, but the
war was not yet over. Consequently,
when he Jumped to the conclusion that
Fanny Glen preferred Lacy, he fell into
further error and made the frightful
mlBtake of depreciating his rival.
Assuming with masculine Inconsis
tency that the . half acceptance she .had
given him entitled him to decide her
future, he actually referred to Lacy's,
well-known habits and bade her have
nothing to do with him.

would probably alter â at least for
a tlnie! Love, In its freshness, would
m&ke her a willing slave: for how long,
events only could determine. For some
a lifetime, for others an hour
en!y can elapse before the chains turn
frtm adornments to shackles.
The anger that MIsa Fanny Glen felt
at this particular moment gave her a
temporary reassurance as to some ques
tions which had agitated herâ how
xnech she cared, after all for Lieuten
ant Rhett Sempland, and. did she. like
fclin better than Major Harry Lacy?
Both Questions were Instantly decided
In the negative â for the time being.
Eh* hated Rhett Sempland, per contra,
at that moment, she loved Harry Lacy.
For Harry Lacy was he about whom
tbe difference began. Rhett Sempland.
confident of his own affection and hope
ful as to hers, had attempted, with
zncscrullne futility and obtuseness, to
prohibit the further attentions of Har
ry Ltcy.
Just as good blood, au fond, ran In
Harry Lacy*s veins as In Rhett Semp
lacd's, but Lacy, following In the foot
steps of his ancestors, had mixed his
vith water that Is not water because
It is fire.
He "crooked the pregnant hinges" of
thr elbow without cessation, many a
time and oft. and all the vices â as they
usually do â followed en train. One of
the oldest names in the Carolinas had
b$;n dragged in the dust by this latest
d*5?nerate scion thereof. Nay, in that
dust Lacy had v.allowed â shameless.
persistent, beast-like.
Lacy, therefore, the Civil War

It afforded another and more con
renial outlet for the wild passion beat-

has sung since Troia's day, of women,
too.
He did not give ever th- habit* of a
lifetime, xvhich. though .short, had been
hard, but he leavensd them, temporar
ily obliterated them even, br splendid
feats of arms. Fortune was kind to
him. Opportunity smiled upon him.
T.'as it running the blockade off
Charleston, or parsing through the en

or heading a desperate attack on Little
Round Top In Pennsylvania, he always
Von the plaudits of men. often the love
cf women. And in It all he seemed to
be.'ir a charmed life.
When the people saw him Intoxicated
on the streets of Charleston that winter
of *C3 they remembered that he was a
hero; when some of his more frightful
transgressions came to light, they re
called some splendid feat of arms and
condoned what before they had cen
sured.
Wow he happened to be In Charles
ton was because he had been 6hot to
r ie ccs at Gettysburg and had been
?â¢ett down there to die. But die he
would not, at least not then. He would
dot have cared much about living, for
fee realized that, when the war was
ever, ha would speedily sink back to
that level to which he habitually de
scended, there being nothing to engage
his energies, but his acquaintance with
Miss Fanny Glen 1 had altered him.
Lacy met her in the hospital and
there he loved her. Rhett Sempland
met her in a hospital, too. Poor Semp
land had been captured In an obscure
skirmish late in 1831. Through some
hitch in the matter he "had been held*
prisoner In the North until the, closÂ« ;
of 1S63, when he had been exchanged*"
and. wretchedly ill. he had come back'
to Charleston, like Lacy, to die. '-._. , ; .
He had found no opportunity for dls->
tlnctlon of any sort. : Ther^ was n.?';
glory about his situation, but prison;
life and fretting had made him ehoVr
what he had suffered." At. the hospital;
then, like Lacy, he too had fallen in
love i\ith Miss Fanny Glen. . ' >
By rights the hero, not of this story,
perhaps, but the real hero, was much
the handsomer of the twoâ it is always
so in romances; and romancesâ good
ones, that isâ are the reflex of life.. Such
a combination of manly beauty with
unshakable courage and reckless auda
city was not often seen as Lacy exhib
ited. Sempland was homely. Lacy had
French and Irish blood in him and he
showed it. Sempland was a mixture
of sturdy Dutch and English stock. Yet
if women found Lacy charming they in
stinctively depended upon Sempland.
There was something thoroughly at

unconsciously fell under the spell of his
strong personality. The" lasting. impresf

Nobody knew anything about F,anny
Glen. At least there were two facts

were sufficient. One was that she was
good. The men In the hospital called
her an angel. The other was that she
was beautiful. The women of the city
could not exactly see' why the men
thought bo, which was confirmation
strong as proofs of Holy Writ!
She had come to Charleston at the
outbreak of the v/ar accompanied by
an elderly woman of unexceptional
manner and appearance who callea
herself Miss Lucy Glen, and described
herself as Misa : Glen*s\ aunt.

gan to feel acutely the hardships of the
war which it had done. more than, any
other section to promote.
Then Fanny Glen showed her quality.
A vast hospital was established and the
young women of the city volunteered
their services.
The corps of nurses was In a state
of constant fluxion. Individuals came
and went. Some of them married pa
tients, some of them died with them,
but Fanny Glen abided.
Not merely because she stayed while
others did not, but perhaps on account
of her innate capacity, as well as her
tactful tenderness, she became the chief
of the women attached to the hospital.
Many a sick soldier lived to love her.
'Many another, more sorely stricken,
died blessins her.
In Charleston she was regarded as

commanded the troops and who. with

hurled upon the citj( from the Union

Fanny Glen was a privileged cnarao

Toward the clo6e of 1863. â¢ however,
there was an eclipse i" the general

She made a half step toward the'hand

toward the homelier 'and stronger. In
her heart . of hearts she found in that
moment whom she preferred. And as
love Is wayward, in the knowledge
came a surprise for her â and it brought
shame. Lacy was handsome .and gal
lant and distinguished, in spite of all,
but Sampland was strongâ a man In
deed. : - "
j "Oh." she cried, looking at him, "if
you only had dona something great.
or "
"What!" he cried, his face alight.
But she -turned Instantly away. In
her words Lacy, subtler and raora used
to women, read her preference and hlÂ»
rejection. But he smiled bravely and
kindly at her in splta of his knowledge.
"Major Lacy." she said, giving him
her hand, "I esteem you, I honor you,
I respect you. I do not believe what
this â what has been said about you.
But I. do not lova >ou." She drew
away from him. "You were mistaken.
There is no choice between you, for 1
love neither of you. . I da not love any
body. I hate you both!" she flashed out
Inconsistently. "Now go! I dont want
to seÂ« either of you again."
She buried her face In her handa aad
burst Into tears.
"I will do something to desarre your
praise," said Sempland In his deep
voice, turning away.
"Miss Glen.", said Lacy most gra
ciously (Fanny Glen's Â¦ presence
seemed to call all that was good in him
to the surface), "no one has respected
me, or trusted me. or honored me aa
you have, for years. 8emplasd cannot

CHAPTER~ni.
HOW THE OPPORTUNITY WAS
PRESENTED.
\ "Well, Sempland," said Lacy* with
astonishing courtesy and forbearance
under all the circumstances, as ho over
took the older man plodding along the
shaded street, "you don't seem to -be
In much greater favor with the yeans
lady than I." ,
"Lacy." returned the other, "you did

"Faith, all th* world may know It

"That's unjust. I hava never men

paused.
"What?" asked Lacy.
"Why. that about my not having.

"On. that was a trifle."
"I know. But not many men would
have s<ild it at the time."
"I tell you what it is, Cempland. j I
like you. I always havtf liked you.
When Iâ <r â dropped out of the old set,
you know, before the war, I didn't
mind giving up any one so much as you.
And I was sorry for you to-night Tou

face to flush with pleasure; "I am surÂ«

"I will master It or die!"
"Of course, but don't die. Master

"What is it?"
"I am going to take out the David
to-night"
"What!"
"Yes. It's a dead secret but I can
tell you. There are three blockade
runners ready to sail. The Wabash
lies off the Main Ship Channel. Of
course, all the others are blockaded,
too, but General Beauregard thinks
that if we can torpedo the flagship the
others will hurry to her assistance
and the blockade runners can get out
through the Swash Channel. Our
magazines are running low. and we
must have arms, powder, and every
thing. There are two or three, ship
loads at Nassau. This Is an attempt
to get to them- If we can blow up
Admiral Vernon's flagship perhaps we
can raise the blockade. At any rate,
it's the only chance for the blockade
runners to get out"
"Did the general order you to do
this?"
"Certainly not I suggested it to
him. They don't order any one to the
David, you know."
"I should say not," returned Semp
land. "Shfe's been down five times,
hasn't she?"
"Yes, and every time with all, of her
crew."
"How many all told has she carried
to death ?"
"Some thirty or more, I believe."
"And she has Tiever done any dam
age to the enemy."
"She scraped the paint off the New
Ironsides one night. and scared her
crew to death, I reckon, but that's
all."
"Lacy!" cried Sempland suddenly,
"I have n*o right to ask favors of you,
but â "
"That's all right Ask."
"Let me go to-night"
â¢"What's the use? One officer is
enough, and you could not do any
good by going along. I should be in
command â "
"Let me go in your place!"
"Nonsense! It's almost certain
death."
"I don't care. It's my chance. I
can run the thing as well as you."
"Oh, anybody can run the thing for
that matter."
"My life is of no more value to the
South or to me than yours. Come!
You have had your chances, and im
proved them; give this to me."
Lacy hesitated. Â¦
"Sempland, you're a fool, as I said
before. You're running away from
the woman who loves you. You're
risking your life."
"Never mind about that" returned
the other. "She doesn't love me and
I want to do It For Ood's sake, old
man, don't be selfish! Let me have an
opportunity!"
Sempland was ordinarily a reticent
and a quiet man, but this possibility
awoke him into action. He pleaded
so long, and so hard, and so deter
minedly that he overbore the weaker
man and finally wrung from him a
grudging assent te his request
"If the general Is willing I'll give
you my chance."
"Thank you. Ood bless you! If I
don't come back remember that
you're to make a man of yourself â for
her." . ; â¢â¢'., Â¦}.^ ;:^
"You will come back. You must
come back!" '
"General Beauregard," said* Lacy,
as the two young officers were ushered
into the general's office, "I have a
most unusual request to make of you,,
sir." .
"What is it Major Lacy?" returned
the other man.
"I want you to relieve me of the
duty of taking out the David to-night,
sir." â¢ - Â¦ Â¦ N
"What!"
"I want you to- give It to Mr. Semp
land here." â¢ .Â¦
"You wish to avoid the danger?"
queried Beauregard, gazing intently at
Lacy.
"He does it as a favor. to me, gener
al," interrupted Sempland. "He has
had his chance, and I have had none.
I begged and implored him to allow
me to go, and only wrung a most re
luctant consent from him."
The general turned his head away;
his fingers tapped softly oh the desk.
j "Things have not gone as we
wished," he murmured half to him
self, "the South is hard. pushed, In

becomes hoarder and harder, but we
may not despair for our beloved coun

ships running down tq aid the Wa

solemnly. , . ' t .
He put out his hand to the young
man and he shook It vigorously.
"I pray that I may succeed for the
sake of the South, , sir," returned
Sempland firmly. '
"For the sake of the South, gentle
men. That is our watchword," cried
Beauregard, standing up and bringing
9 "He is going to take out the David."
"Yes?"
"And blow up the Wabash."
Her. hand went to her heart Her
face turned whiter than the frock she
wore.
"My God!" she whispered, "Admir
al Vernon's ship!" .
Â¦'She loves him! She loves him!"
flashed into Lacy's mind, and for the
moment he suffered agonies of jealous
pain. y
"But," continued the girl, "why
should theyâ ".
"In the first place.*' went on Lacy,
"If tÂ£e venture succeeds, we sink a
noble ship and put out of the way. a
most determined enemy, and we hope
to let the blockaded cotton ships get
to sea.".
, "But the David!" said the girl, who
knew the sinister story of the crazy
submarine torpedo boat as did every
one in Charleston. "It is sure death!"
" "It is dangerous," Bald Lacy softly,
"but General Beauregard has ordered
Sempland to keep her on the surface.
That ought to give them a chance.
Glassell escaped, you remember, when
he tried the New Ironsides."
"He will be killed! He will be
killed!" she cried piteously, "and â
Admiral Vernon!"
"What is the Yankee admiral to
you, to any of us?" Lacy asked, curi
ously interested to know the meaning
of her remark.
"Why do you tell me of all thla?"
she asked, falling to notice his ques
tion in her anxiety and alarm.
"Because I want you to know Semp
land as the hero he ia and becauseâ
forgive my frankness â -I believe that
you love him. So I want him to hear
you say it before he gpep out It will
double his chances of escape if he has
your love to think of. You will iu-
' "Yes," whispered the girl* "if you
will send him to me."
â¢There is no to lose. I will
have him here in a few moments."
As he turned away the girl
stretched out her hand to him.
"You have been ; very goodâ very
brave â very noble," she faltered. ."I
wish- â i â I loved you more * thanâ
than I do." â¢
He stooped over her and kissed her
bended head. She was small and so
appealing. He breathed a prayer
over her and tore himself away.
"Thank you," he said, "you have
rewarded me.' Good by."
CHAPTER IV.
STRONG ROOM AND STRONG MAN.
As she heard his departing, foot
step on the porch the poor girl threw
herself down upon her knees and
lifted her hands.
"The South- andâ and â he, -mistak
en but stlll-^r-ah, where is my duty?
The ship and Rhett Sempland! I love
him. I cannot let him go! It would
be wicked. God pity me! But how.
how to prevent it? If I can only de
lay him until to-morrow, I can tell tha
general everything, and â is there a
way, is there a way, oh, God ?"
She thought deeply, every atom in
her being concentrated on the prob
lem which tore her between love and
duty, devotion to the cause of the
South and those other appeals, which,
finding lodgment in her heart moved
her so profoundly. She wrestled with
the question as to where her duty lay
as Jacob wrestled with the angel of
old, and if she did not conquer, at
least she decided. Determining on a
desperate course of action, she rose to
her feet and sharply struck a bell by
her side on the table. The house was
them out As they were talking to
gether a light step sounded on he
porch. There was a ring at the door.
The men hurried to their places af
concealment. Miss Fanny Glen hid tn
the dark drawing-room, as Caesar
shuffled along the hall to the front
door.
"Your mistress has sent for me."
said Sempland. And from where she
stood in the drawing-room, Fanny
Glen's heart leaped at the tones of his
voice, k,;.,"
"Yas. sun." returned the darky, ob
sequiously ushering him through the
hall. "Step right dls way, sun. Mass'

The room was one which Sempland
had never entered before. It was
small, furnished like a library or of
fice, with several large closets and an
old iron safe, and had two grated win
dows and one heavy mahogany door.
It had formerly been used as an office
and as, a treasure room. Seeing the
visitor- safe within Caesar calmly
withdrew, and as he' adroitly coughed
violently in' the pasoago Sempland did
not hear the ponderous key turning la

to open It It did net give.
"Locked!" he muttered tn surprise.
Raising his hand he struck a light
blow on the panels, but there was ne
reply* Then he called out and re
ceived no answer. He struck and
called again and again, his volee ris
ing to a shout while his hands were
bleeding from the blows he had
rained on the, surface. Finally a voice
came to him faintly through the door.
"Wat's de matta. suh?" Â¦
"Open this door instantly, yen blade
dogl Where is Miss Glen?"
"She's a-comln', su,h?"
"I wish to see her immediatelyP*
he cried impetuously, battering again
upon the door in furious rage, which
was stilled the Instant he heard her
voice outside.
"Mr. Sempland ?"
"What is the meaning of this ac
tion, this outrage. Miss Glen?" he
cried. "You sent for me. I came.
Why am I locked in here? Opea the
door! I must leave immediately'"
"You are locked in here by my or
ders, Mr. Sempland," said Fanny Qlea
nervously.
"Impossible! For what ' reason ?"
"Because I â I â "
"By heavens, this is maddening!
You don't know what you dot I am
ordered to-night on a hazardous ex
pedition. I must be at my post in ten
minutes. Let me out instantly!"
"I know," returned the girl.
. "Well, then, why don't you ope?
this door? I will* say nothing of
thisâ"
"I cannot"
"Why not?"
"I â :I â do not wish you to go out on
the David."
"What is it to you? How dare you
interfere? You said I had done
nothing but He in prison," he replied.
"I will show you to-night."
"Not to-night"
"This is madness! Think what you
are doing!"
"I can't help it"
"Why not?"
"Because I â I â "
"In God's name, what do you
mean?"
'"I will not have you taks tha risk.
It is certain death to you, and the ad
miral's ship â " said the girl so softly
that he could scarce hear her. "You
will forgive me when you understand.
I shall release you to-morrow. Mercy!
Have pity on me, I am almost crazy!"
"Do you know that you will dis
honor me? If you care let me go."
"There Is another reason. I will not
have the Wabash blown up. There Is
a â a â "
"Another man?" shouted Sempland.
"You are a coquette! Let me out I
say! I will get out! My God, was ever
a man in such a situation?"
He beat and hammered on the door
until his bruised hands bled again. He
shook it in its frsine like a madman.
He was exhausted by the violence of
hla efforts and of his passion.
Through it all the girl stood in the
hall frightened nearly to death.
What mad scheme had she entered
upon?, Had she strength enough to
carry it through? The three servants
were terrified also, their eyes rolling
in their sockets, their hands nervous
ly fingering their weapons. Suddenly
another voice, Caesar's, broke
though the turmoil, reaching even tha
ear of the desperate man on the other
side of the heavy mahogany door. He
stopped to Itsten.
"Miss Fanny," said the butler,
"dah's a soger man out at de do' an*
he wants to know If Mass' Semplan'
is heah."
"Tell him, no," said Fanny Glen
resolutely. "Say he left a half hour
ago."
. "My God!" groaned Serapland, "I
am a disgraced and ruined man! Lis
ten to me, Fanny Glen! I swear to
you, on my honor aa a gentleman, if
you do not instantly open this door
I'll blow my brains out in this room!"
"Oh, you wouldn't do that?"
'- "I would, so help me God!"
' There wsus conviction in his voice.
The girl listening in the passage
heard the click of a raised hammer.
"Don't!" she cried in greater terror
than ever, "I will open!"
He heard a brief whispered consul
tation, the key was turned In the lock
and the door was suddenly flung open.
Sempland darted toward it on the In
stant and .recoiled from the terrible
figure of the little woman barring
him with outstretched arms. If he
had suffered within, she had suffered
without the room. Such a look of
mortal agony' and anguish he had
never seen on any human face. She
trembled violently before him. Yet
she was resolute not to give way, de
termined to . keep the door. Clus-
an ancient mansion when it had. been
rented by her aunt and herself three
years before. It dated back to Colo
nial times* There was a strong room
in it, the windows of which were
barred. It would make a safe prison
for any one. He should be put in
there and kept there until morning.
He would be safe there. % No harm
would come to the ship and when the
general knew he would forgive her.
She would tell him the first thing in
the morning.. It would cause her
lover pain and grief, this summary ac
tion of hers, but he would forgive her
and she would reward him with her
self! There was compensation, she
thought proudly and tenderly.
"Caesar," she said as the aged but
ler made his appearance in response
to the bell, "send Joe and Sam and
Cato to me. Beys," she continued as
three stalwart young negroes pre
sented themselves before her soon
after, "Mr. Sempland is coming here
to-night to see ma. I â he â " she
found it somewhat difficult to explain.
"General Beauregard wants him de
tained here. I cannot let him get
away. Show him Into the strong
room on the other side of the 'house
when he asks for me, and then lock
the door on him. Don't let him get
out 'under any circumstances until to
morrow, but on no account are you to
do him any hurt You hear? You
understand?"
"Ya-as, Miss Fanny, I specs we
does," answered Cato, the oldest and
most intelligent of the three.
"Caesar, you show him into the
strong room. Say I will meet him
there in a moment The rest of you
stay in the passage, and as soon as he
enters lock the door upon him. Don't
neglect that! He'll try to get out He
may break the, door down. But you
must keep him there even if he at
tempts to kill you â unless I say for
you to release him."
The three slaves were devoted to
their young mistress and accepting
her orders without a question, they at
once begun their preparations to carry
â¢ s7
spire him to come back. As it is now,
I am afraid he does not especially
care to. He's too good a man to lose,
if weâ if youâ can save him, Miss
Fanny."
"And this man abused you to me
this afternoon!" murmured the girl.
"He said what was true. I honor
him for it. I love you, Miss Fanny.'
I am proving it to you now as I
proved it to him when I gave him my
place at his earnest entreaty. The de
tail was mine. I gave him the

"For his sake, for yours. Â¦ It's his
solitary chance. I've had so many,

"And he <ls going to blow up the

"Yes if he can." ' :.'.'.
Fanny Glen was a picture of terror
plainly apparent in spite of her vali
ant effort to conceal Ker feelings. Her
agitation was so overwhelming, her
anxiety so pronounced, that even on
the hypothesis of an ardent affection
for Sempland, Lacy was completely at
a loss to account for her condition.
What could it mean? But he had no %
tie to speculate upon It. The min
utes were flying by.
"Come, Miss Glen," he said at last,
"it isn't so bad as all that."
"But those men on the ship the â

for their lives. It is appalling to
think of ! I cannot bear it! Iâ"
"Let them lift the blockade then,"
coolly returned the young officer, "It

sympathy, on them. Bestow it nearer

goes?"

"Have you any preparations to
make, Sempland?" asked Lacy when
they left the office. . Â¦â¢â¢"
"I have 'a letter to write."
"Very well. I will look after the
boat and will meet you on the wharf.
Shall you see Miss. Glen before you
go?"
"No." .
"You must."
"I cannot. What difference does it
make to her anyway? I will be at the
wharf 'âhe looked at his watch, it
was already 6 o'clock â "in three
quarters of an hour. Good by.
The two men shook hands and sepa
rated. -
"The boat is ready," said Lacy to
himself, "I saw to that this afternoon.
There is nothing for me to do there.
I wonderâ by Jove, I'll do It!"
A few minutes after he was ushered
again Into the presence of Miss Fanny
Glen. She had at first pleaded indis
position, but he had insisted upon see
ing her. â¢
"I have something of so much im
portance to tell you, Miss Glen," he
began as she entered the room, "that
I was forced .to override your de
sires." , Â¦;;-,;Â¦ J:
"Is it about the subject that weâ I

"It is not. I shall say no more on

girl. "I admire you, respect you, but

"I understand.. Never mind that

"I do, sir," returned Sempland.
"Is life worth bo little to you that
you are willing to sacrifice It?"
"There is Lacy, sir."
"Oh, he is different!" burst out the
general, and then bit his lip. "It
would- be greatly to Lacy** credit,"
had flashed Into his mind, "If he could
manage to die In some such heroic ac
tion."
Lacy and Sempland knew what the
general thought, and Sempland could
think of no words to bridge over the
pause. - ,
"You see." at last said Lacy smiling
satirically at Sempland, "the general
understands. You would better let

"No. The thing sometimes works.

"Yas, sun," answered Cato.
"I have your mistress In my arms,

Fanny Glen In a ringing voice, still
making no effort to struggle and look

with the expression of a martyr and
an angeL He saw and recognized, but
persisted. It was his only way.
"Open instantly!" he said again, "un

That was a threat the men could not
resist. In a 6econd the door was
opened. The awestruck faces of the
blacks peered Into the room.
"Throw down your arms, here at my
feet, you black hounds!" shouted
Sempland. "Quick! Or I flre!"
Instantly knife, pistol and bludgeon
clattered on the floor at his feet.
"Out of the way now! Leave the
bail! I want a clear passage!"
"Kill me! Kill me!" cried the girl,
"and have done!"

"You have dishonored me!" he cned.
"I fear it is too late. I wouldn't hurt
a hair of your head. But I love youâ
I love vou!"
He strained her to his breast, press
ing a passionate, burning kiss upon her
lips. He -wasted a few precious sec
onds, but he could not help it. She
threw her arms about his neck and re
turned his kiss. He could feel her heart
beating against his own.
"I cannot let you go!" she cried.
"Stay with me and I am yours."
"I must go!"
He tore himself from her and ran
down the passage into the street. She
thought she would have fainted at that
Instant, but somethingâ suspense, the
faint possibility of success, doubtâ
nerved her to action. After a few mo
ments of awful uncertainty she fol
lowed Sempland along the passage into
the street. He was not to be seen. She
knew where he had gone, however, and
she bent her steps toward the Govern
ment wharf. Ebe went slowly at first,
bat. finally ran at her greatest speed.
CHAPTER V.
THE HOUR AND THE MAN.
The David, bo named because al
though she was email It was hoped she
would strike terror to the huge Go
llaths of the Union fleet, was built of
boiler Iron. Ehe was thirty feet long
and of a cigar shape, her greatest diam
eter being a little less than six feet.
She was propelled by a hand engine
worked by members of her crew, and
could be submerged at pleasure, but
experience had shown that once down
ehe usually Btayed down with all on
board. A resume of her history has
been given. She was a floating or sink
ing death trao.
Originally she was intended to drag
after her a floating torpedo In the hope
that she could pass under a vessel's
keel and explode the torpedo when she
reached the proper position. General
Beauregard, however, had positively
forbidden that she should be Mised as
a submarine any longer on account of
her disastrous behavior, and on this
occasion she was provided with a long
spar sticking out from her nose, on the
end of which was 100 pounds of pow
der in a copper cylinder provided with
four extremely sensitive tubes of lead
containing a highly explosive mixture
which would Ignite upon contact with
a chip's side or bottom and explode the
torpedo.
She was tainted a slate gray and
her ballast was so adjusted that with
the eight men who manned her on
board, one to steer, one to look After
the torpedo, and six to turn the pro
peller crank, her low hatch scarcely
rose above the water. In that condi
tion, and especially at night, she
looked like a plank floating on the sur
face. By hard and conscientious labor
her man-power engine could shove her
along at about a speed of four knots.
Although, the order of General Beaure
gard that she should not be submerged
again had materially diminished the
risk which experience had shown was
overwhelming, yet the proposed expedi
tion was nevertheless hazardous In the
extreme.
In the- first place an excellent look
out was kept on the Union ships on ac
count of the several attempts which
had been made against them by simi
lar boats. If she were discovered, one
shot striking the boat as che ap
proached, even a rifle shot, would suf
fice to sink her. No one knew what she
would do even If she succeeded In ex
ploding the torpedo. It was scarcely
hoped that she could get away from a
sinking ship In that event.
The little party of coldlers grouped
on the wharf bade good-by to the men
who entered the deadly affair as If they
were eaying farewell to those about to
die. Every preparation had been made,
the artillery officer had finally and
carefully Inspected the torpedo to see
that it was In good working order, the
men had descended Into the cramped
narrow little hull of the boat and had
made ready to start the propeller.
None of them wore any superfluous
clothing, for it was oppressively hot in
the confined area of the little iron shell,
and they might have to swim for their
lives anywayâ perhaps they would be
lucky if they got the chance. In short,
everybody was ready and every one
was there except the commander of the
expedition.
Great secrecy has been observed in
the preparations lest there might be
a spy In the town who, learning of
the attempt, would communlcete the
valuable Information to the Federal
fleet and so frustrate it. General Beau
regard had caused the . wharf to be
cleared and guarded early in the even-
Ing. It was quite dark in February at
6 o'clock and no one except hi* tmsled
for somt reason which he could not
explain he refrained from easing any
thing about Sempland's visit to Fanny
Glen, merely advising- the Â¦ general. In
response to an inquiry, that he had
left him to go to his quarters to write
a letter. ,
Five minutes more dragged along*.
"General Beauregard," said Lacy at
last, "with your permission I will nek
him myself."
"No," said the general sternly, "we
can wait no longer. I need you for
something" else."
"You mean Â¦ V
"I mean that I shall carry out the
original plan. Mr. Sempland has for
feited any consideration whatever at
our hands."
Lacy pointed toward the David.
'"Unless you wish to back out."
"No one has ever used these words
to me, sir," answered Lacy proudly.
"I am ready, as anxious, to go as I
ever was. But Sempland â sir, I would
Â¦take my life on his fidelity."
"It may be so. I can wait no longer.
Will you go, or shall I give up the ex
pedition?" .
"Rather than that, sir," said one of
his staff officers, "If Major Lacy hesi
tates let me."
"Enough!" said Lacy. "Will you ex
plain to Sempland how it came about?
Good-by."
CHAPTER V.
THE HOUR AND THE MAN.
Lacy tore off his coat and vest, threw
them on the wharf, saluted the general
and stepped Into the boat. Some one In
the group lifted a lantern. The flick
ering light fell on the pale faces of the
determined men.
"Good-by," said Beauregard; "you, at
least, are an officer, a soldier of -whom
the South is proud. Remember the flag
ship is your game. She lies at anchor
right off the Main Ship Channel. Good
luck to you. A colonel's shoulder straps
await you here If
you come back.
God bless you all."
He wrung the ma
jor's hand, watched
him step into the
David and whisper
an order to his
men, heard him call
out: "Good-by. sir.
If we don't come
back don't forget
us," and that was
all.
The little boat
was shoved away
from the wharf by
willing hands and
In a moment was
lost In the darkness
of the bay. There
was no moon, and
the night was
dark. There was
no light aave

only explain himself by Implicating the
woman he loved.' The consequences In
either case were dreadful. Fanny Glen
a traitor to the j South? Beauregard
was a stern, inexorable soldier. He
would not condone such â an offense as
hers. That 'she had failed In her ef
fort to prevent the expedition would
mean nothing to the general. Fanny
Glen, the pride of Charleston, the wo
man who had done more for the South
than any other woman In the Caroli
nas, perhaps, to be disgraced, certainly
to be punished, It might beâ shot! 'She
had ruined him, but he had kissed her.
He could not say the word which would
Incriminate her and leave him free. He
was disgraced already; he would be
cashiered. Well, what mattered it?
His chance was rone, the woman did
not love him. His heart was hot against
her. Yet he remembered the scene In
the strong roomâ had she, indeed, re
turned his kiss? He closed his lips
firmly and said nothing. He would not,
he could not betray her, even to him
self.
"You do not answer, sir! What ex
cuse h.-_ve you to offer?"
"None."
"You sought this detail. You forced
yourself into the expedition. Have you
nothing to say for yourself?"
"Nothing."
"You are under arrest, sir, for diso
bedience of orders, for dereliction of
duty. By heavens!" said the general,
striking his left hana with his right,
"for cowardice!"
"For God's sake, not that, sir!"
"For cowardice, sir! You knew the
expedition was one of extreme hazard/
You have no excuse to offer for not
having been here. What else is It?"
"Not that. sir. Not that!" pleaded
the lieutenant. "Anything but that!"
"A traitor, a coward, I say!"
"General, Beauresrard!" cried a high
pitched voice out of the darkness, shrill
and unnatural with terror and fatigue.
The next moment Fanny Glen herself,
bareheaded, panting from her rapid run,
white faced In the light cast by the
lantern held by the staff officer, pushed
through the group
surrounding the
general.
"Where is Mr.
Sempland, â¢ sir?"
she asked.
"Here, under ar
rest. He failed to
arrive in time. Can
you explain it?"
"The boat?"
"Gone."
"Gone? This

took It out"
our country will reward us. If we do
not, the will not forget us. Shake
hands, now. Good-by and God bless
you. Put every pound of muscle you
have Into that crank when we get with
in one hundred yards of the frigate and
jump the boat into her. I'll give the
signal. I want to strike her hard."
"Ay, ay, sir," replied the seamen, as
cheerfully as if there was only a frolic
before' them. "We'll do our best. Good
by and God bless you, sir. We're
proud to serve under you, whatever
comes."
"Thank you. All ready with the tor
pedo, captain?"
"Yes, Major Lacy."
"Good. Down everybody, now! Clap
to the hatch covers and start the
cranks. Easy at first, and when I give
the wordâ hard!" .
He seized the spokes of the steering
wheel In his steady hand as he spoke.
Back of him, to relieve him in case of
accident, stood Captain Wagner, the
artillery officer. The. heavy planks
were drawn over the open hatch, locked
and bolted. Silently the men manned
the cranks. The little engine of de
struction sped away. It was pitch dark
and very close and hot. There. was no
sound in the shell save the slight creak
ing of the cranks and the deep breath
ing of the crew as they toiled over
them. .
Forward by the wheel there was a
glass hood which permitted the men
who steered to direct the course of
the boat. As the sinister, sea demon
stole. through the waters Lacy caught
a sudden glimpse at last of the spars
of a heavy ship at anchor before him.
The night had cleared somewhat, and
ergy, fairly hurled the torpedo-boat
on the doomed ship. Lacy had time for
a single upward glance â hla last look at
anything! The black railing towering:
above his head was swarming with
men. Flashes of light punctured the
darkness. Bullets pattered like rain on
the Iron. One or two tore through the
flimsy shell. A Jet of water struck him
In the face.
The next second there was a terrlflo
concussion. The torpedo struck the ship
just forward the mainmast and explod
ed, tearing a great hole in the side ex
tending far below the water line. In
the blaze of light that followed the
men In the David cheered wildly and
the next moment blackness over
whelmed them. v . -
On the frigate then was the wildest
confusion as the sleeping men below
came swarmlnt up on deck.' .Boms of
them never succeeded in reaching the
hatchways and were drowned where
they slept. Some were killed by the
explosion. The officers, however, quickly
restored order, and as a last resort or
dered the surviving men into the rig
ging, for the water where she lay was
shallow and there they could find safe
ty. The ship was hopelessly lost. In
deed, she began to sink so soon as the
torpedo exploded. The water poured
Into her vitals and soon the crash of
exploding: boilers and the hiss of escap
ing steam added their quota to the con
fusion.
Some of the cooler among the officer*
and men lingered on the decks, small
arms In hand, searching the sea on
every hand until the decks were awash.
They were looking and hoping for a
chance at the boat which had caused
them such a terrible disaster, but they
never saw her. She had disappeared.
Signals had been burned Instantly on
the shattered ship. Far up and down
the line the lights of moving vessels
burning: answering signals showed that
they wer* alert to render assistance.
Boats, ship's cutters, dashed alongside
to render help, and they, too, sought
the torpedo-boat, but in vain. 8he was
not to be found.
At the same time the ships of the
fleet did not move from their appointed
stations, and when the blockade run
ners came dashing down through the
Swash channel in the hope that the
vessels usually stationed there would
b* withdrawn In the excitement they
were met by a deadly fire from the
rifled guns, which rendered It Impossi
ble for them to proceed. They turned
tall and fled. Two of them succeeded
in returning; to the harbor. One of them
never cam* bade 8he waa set on fire
and burned by the shells of the ships.
The monitors and Ironclads Joined In
the battle, the forts returned the fire
and the quiet night was filled with the

shells.
Lacy's had been a gallant and heroic
attempt. It had succeeded as to the
blowing ud of a Federal warship, but
It had failed otherwise. By a singular
freak of fortune the blow had not
fallen upon the vessel for which It had
been intended. After dark the fine
new sloop-of-war Housatonlc had
replaced the Wabash off the Main
Ship Channel, and she had suffered
Instead of the flaeshlu.
Although when day broke she was
sought for again, nothing more was
seen of the David. At least not
then. With the explosion of the tor
pedo she had vanished from the fac*
of the waters. For a long time General
Beauregard and the people In Charles
ton waited for tidings of her, but It was
not until the war was over and the
Housatonic was raised that the mys
tery was solved. They found the tor
pedo boat with her nose Jammed Inex
tricably into the hole she had torn in
the side of the ship. Perhaps the In
rush of the waves had sucked her Into
the opening, and the roll of the ship
had fastened her more securely. At
any rate she was there. She was, of
course, filled with water, and In her,
at their stations, they found the bodies
of her devoted crew, Lacy with his
hand in the wheel.
Nothing in life had so become Lacy as
the ending of It. It Is a proverb that
the good men do lies burled with them,
the evil is long remembered. It was
not so in his case, at any rate, for men
forgot everything but the dauntless
heroism with which he had laid down
his life for his country, and that as
sured his fame.
And, after all. he was not to be pitied,
for he died the death of his choice.

A MISERABLE PAIR AND A MIS
ERABLE NIGHT.
Sempland's mind was in a fearful
turmoil. It had all come so suddenly
and unexpectedly upon him that as
yet he hardly realized the gravity of
his situation, although It could scarce
ly be worse. He was under arrest and
in confinement, facing such serious
charges as neglect of duty, disobedi
ence of orders, treason, cowardice!
As to these last, he was so conscious
of his loyalty and Intrepidity that they
did not worry him so much as they
might have done. The other things
were bad enough, but surely, surely*
no one could either believe him either
a traitor or a coward!
His mind did not dwell on his own
situation as it might have dose, either.
If it had not been for Fanny Glen. In
stinctively he had stepped forward t*
gather her in. his arms when she faint
ed before him on the wharf that night,
but he had been sternly waved back
by the general and, without being
given a chance to learn anything
about her condition, he had been hur
ried to headquarters and heavily
guarded In the room where he was to
be held pending Beauregard's further
pleasure. As for Fanny Glen, although
Sempland could not know it, the sur
geon who had been present had
speedily revived that young woman, a
carriage had been summoned, and she
had been taken home under the escort
of one of the staff officers.
Continued Next Week.
' although there was
no moon the stars
Stive sufficient light
for him to see the
black tracery of
masts and yards
lifting .themselves
above the horizon.
How still the loom
ing ship lay. There
-was scarcely sea
enough to tremble
the tophamper of
the unsuspecting man-of-war. . A
faint film of smoke falling lazily
from her funnel in the quiet
air, with her riding and side lights,
were the only signs -of life about her.
No more peaceful looking object
floated over the ocean apparently "It
would be. a pity," reflected the man
at the wheel for an instant, "to strike
her so." But the thought vanished as
soon as it had been formulated. .His
heart leaped in his breast like the
hound when he launches himself in
that last spring which hurls him on
his quarry. Another moment â a. few
more seconds
"That will be our game," whispered
Lacy to the artillery captain, in a
voice in which his feelings spoke.
"Tes."
They were slowly approaching nearer.
The bearings of the cranks and screws
had been well oiled and the David
slipped through the water without a
sound. She was so nearly submerged
that she scarcely rippled the surface of
the water. There was no white line of
foam to betray her movement through
the black water. It was almost Impos
sible for any one to detect the aproach
of the silent terror. /There was nothing
showing above the water except the flat
hatch cover, and that to an unpracticed
eye looked much like a drifting plank.
Yet there were sharp eyes on the ship,
and no negligent watch was kept either.
When the David was perhaps 200 feet
away she was seen. The steadiness of
her movement proclaimed a thing intel
ligently driven. A sharp, sudden cry
from the forecastle ahead of them rang
through the night. " It was so loud and
so fraught with alarm that it came in
a muffled tone to the men in the
depths of the torpedo-boat. A bugle
call rang out, a drum was beaten. The
erstwhile* silent ship was filled with
tumult and clamor. m .
"They have seen us!" said Lacy.
"Ahead!" he cried hoarsely. "Hard!"
At the same instant the chain cable
of the frigate was shipped, bells Jangled
in her depths, the mighty engines
clanked into sudden motion, the screws
revolved, and she began to slowly drive
astern. But it was too late, the sea
devil was too near to be balked of the
prey. The men at the cranks of the
David, working with superhuman en-
"And the Wabash?"
"Will be blown up, please 'God. If all
goes well."
The clrl put her face in her hands,
aa if. to shut out some dreadful pic
ture. She kept them there for a few
seconds, then she lifted her head and
looked unsteadily from the severe face
of the general to the cold, disdainful
countenance of Sempland. The man she
loved shrank away from her.
"Useless! Too late!'-' she murmured,
then fell fainting at their feet.
CHAPTER VI.
DEATH OUT OF THE DEEP.
At 8:30 that night, February 17, 1864,
the little torpedo-boat, after having
successfully passed the monitors and
ironclads anchored Just out of range of
Fort Sumter, and inside the shoals at
the harbor mouth, was stopped about a
mile from the 6uter entrance of the
main ship channel, where her quarry
had been reported as lying quietly at
anchor a^ nightfall. Success had at
tended the efforts of her devoted crew
so far. By Lacy's command the David
was stopped in order to give a little
rest, a breathing space, before the last
dash at their prey, to the weary sea
men who had driven her steadily on
since leaving the wharf.
' The- night was calm and very still.
The hatch covers were thrown back, the
tired men thrust their heads into the
cool, sweet air, so refreshing after the
closeness of their badly ventilated ves
sel, and wetted their fevered, ex
hausted bodies with the stimulating
water of the bay. The artillery officer
took advantage of the opportunity to
make a careful re-examination of the
torpedo, and Lacy was greatly relieved
when he reported that he had every
thing to good : working order so far as
he. was able to Judge. The young com
mander of the expedition was the more
anxious for success because of the pre
vious failures Â¦ of similar endeavors.
After, a v ten-minute rest he gave the
order to get under way.
"Men," he, said coolly, "you know
the history of this boat.- There's a
chance, ay, more than a chance, that
none of us will ever come back from
this expedition. You knew all that when
you volunteered. . If we do get out alive
The torpedo boat
Blipped through
the water without
making: a Bound.
She became entire
ly Invisible a hun
dred feet away.
The officers rubbed
their eyes as -they
etared in the di
rection where they
had last , Been her, almost fearing
that she had again sunk beneath the
sea. They stayed there perhaps five
minutesâ at least, until the blockade
runners, none of them showing: a light
of any description, could get under way
in obedience to a lantern signal from
the general and noiselessly slip down
the bay In the wake of the frail little
craft which It was hoped would be able
to clear the path for them.
"Now," said Beauregard, turning
away at last, "for Mr. Sempland. I do
not understand It. I never thought him
a coward."
"Nor am I, sir," panted a voice out of
the darkness, as a pale and Breathless
man burst through the group surround
ing the general.
"Mr. Semplandl"
"For God'B sake, Â«lr, am I In time?
The boat?"
"Gone."
"How long? Call her back."
"It Is too late. 8hÂ« has been gone
ten minutes. Where were you, sir?"
"Who took her out?"
"Major Lacy. Answer my question,
sir."
"He! Mr God! I am disgraced! Dis
honored! And shÂ»"
"Where were you. Birr*
The young man hesitated.
"â¢Why don't you answer? Do you re
alize your position? You begged this
detail. Why were you not hero?"
. "Oh, General Beauregard" 'Â¦ â â¢
"How could you forget your honor?
The South? Where were you, I -say?
Answer or I will have you shot In. the
morning."
"I â Iâ was detained, sir. I"
"Is that your only excuse, sir?"
sternly.
Sempland was in a fearful predica
ment. To have restrained him by force
was an act of high treason. He. could
staff officers and Lacy^
who had bo magnani
mc-usly surrendered hl3
opportunity to Semp
land, were present. At a quat>
ter before 7, which was the time
Sempland had appointed to re
turn when he left in obedience
to Fanny Glen's summons, the
general besran to feel some
uneasiness. He spoke about it
to Lacy, but was reaspured by that
gentleman, who expressed full confi
dence, that the young lieutenant would
undoubtedly be there in a few mo
ments. He had already of his own mo
tion dispatched a soldier to Fanny
Glen's house and had learned from him
the false nev/s that Sempland had been
there and had left. Lacy supposed he
had returned- to his quarters.
The state of the tide, the necessities
of the blockade runners, who hoped to
escape that night under cover of the
confusion caused by the attack, ren
dered it absolutely necessary that there
should' be no delay In the departure of
the torpedo boat. The time had been
set for 7 o'clock, as late as practicable,
In order to give all the advantage of
'settled darkness before the blow was
delivered* The party on the wharf
waited apprehensively a little longer,
conversing In low tones as the mo
ments ran away, and there was great
anxiety as to the whereabouts of the
missing officer. Beven o'clock struck
from the ancient church steeple hard
but still he did not appear.
"General," said Lacy a few moment*
later. "If I might suggest, sir"
"Go on. What is It?"
"It might be well to send for him/*
"Never!" said the general shortly,
"it Is a soldier's duty to be at the place
appointed him at the specified time.
I shall not send for him. If he has
forgotten himself, his duty, for any
cause, â¢ he shall suffer the. conse
quences." .
Lacy was in despair. He could not
understand the situation. He had not
the slightest doubt of Sempland's
courage. He knew his friend's rigid
Idea of soldierly duty or honor. Where
had he âÂ»ne? If there had been any
way he would have dispatched men
to hunt in every direction, but the gen
eral's prohibition was positive. And
11What did that little boy do? He has
been sent to prison for a month* forlese
majeate, and he has accomplished the
splendid crime at the age of 14. "The
public were excluded from the court,"
writes our Berlin correspondent, so that
we are left to conjecture. Did he curl
his mustache in Imitation of ? But
no, that could hardly be. Was he play
ing at EmperorsV in the street? Or did
he, perhaps, spell the Kaiser's name
with a little "w"? Or was it some mon
strous precocity "euch as criticism of
the Kaiser's portrait that brought the
weight of an empire upon his little
head? Anyhow, little Master Graf has
accomplished the greatest crime that
a Prussian can commit, and he has
done it at the age of 14. We should
dearly like to know exactly, how he did
It. And if we were the Kaiser we
would send for Master Graf, put him
on our knee and get ; him to explain
his views. They would be interesting.
âLondon Chronicle.
Juvenile LesÂ« Majesta.
With the utmost deliberation, how
ever, Tom adjusted his cap,, and with
out an outward tremor made his- way
down stairs and through the yard. Not
a boy spoke to him and he spoke to no
one. Here and there he heard the word
"transfer" and now and then the word
"thief." His rage flamed high In heart
and cheek, but he would have gone to
the stake rather than reveal that every
taunt stung him as no dagger could
have done.
Tom sat through lunch at borne with
the same stony exterior, escaping the
notice of some of the family, while .
father and mother were wiser than to
ask the cause In public. As they rose
from the table Tom took his father's
arm and steered him into the little
"den" beyond the library and shut the
door. Lifting- his arms to his father's
of testimony. Tom would not say an
other word. His heart was almost
bursting. He would not Implicate
Sam, as he had no evidence, although
he could not help feeling that somehow
Sam was at the bottom of the matter.
The principal gave him till the next
morning to confess and proposed after
that time to confer with Tom's father.
There were no tears for Tom this time.
He marched back to his room with set
teeth and compressed lips, but never
with prouder bearing or stralghter
form. He took his seat and opened his
book, staring at It with unseeing eyes
while his soul raged In turmoil within
him. But out from the page looked the
trusting eyes of the little Immanuel,
and calm began to come. It was a long
morning and by noon the story had so
spread among the boys, helped by the
industrious tongue of the gloating Bam,
that Tom dreaded the hour of dismis
sal.
severe, but he resolved to stand it till
school was over. Late In the session
the principal came to the room with a
request that Tom go at once to call
upon Sam, who could not bÂ« quieted
otherwise. Tom could scarcely walk,
and glad he was to meet his father at
the school door and lean upon him dur
ing the walk home. They stopped to
gether at Sam's bouse and on going
into the room where Bam lay heard the
miserable story of the transfers as Sam
told It In repentant sobs.
"Tom, will you ever forgive me, and
how could you risk your life when you
thought I had done you that mean
trick?" Tom thought of the holy eyes,
but had no answer ready. He couldn't
trust Bam Just yet. The transfers
were given to Tom's father, who took
his own boy home, where mother ten
derly cared for the bruised - place and
put the lad to bed where the face of
the little Immanuel shone with Joy into
the tired eyes of the hero of the day.
Tom's father hastened back to the
school and very gladly the principal
heard the story of the transfers. There
were the two bunches to speak for
themselves. He went to j Tom's room
and told it all and the whole room gave
three cheers for the boy who could suf
fer injustice patiently and return good
f or svlL
Bam was the first one of the Invalids
out. The wounded leg proved a more
serious matter than the broken scalp.
Bam was not mean at heart, but his
training at 1 home had not helped him
to be true. He spent now much time
with Tom, and one day he asked again:
"Why did you do it,, Tom?" Tom was
In bed and Sam was lying, boy-fashion
on the covers beside him. Tom pulled
Sam's head up next his own and, point
ins to the. picture at the foot of the
bed, said: "Sam, that's why."
*iiBTOiiMrjiBWBlMlnff^Br*fititfTP^ii^ffSTfisi^jjtft^iBa^ssl
Â¦ During: the afternoon the pain In his
leg, scarcely noticeable at first, became
All this, in an Instant, wtnt through
Tom's brain, and then the appealing
eyes of the little Immanuel settled it.
With swift prayer for, aid and swifter
feet to the rescue, Tom burled himself
in front of the car and against Sam,'
knocking him outside the track and
away from its fatal path.' Sam's head
was badly hurt, but anything waa bet
ter than the certain death which
otherwise would have been his. Tom
was unhurt, except for a severe blow
upon his leg from the passing car. Sam
was Â¦ tenderly * carried to his home and
Tom took his place In school without
a word. The bell rang and school was
in session, very few hiavlns; rightly
understood what had happened:
senger. Every one was watching the
ball and no one seemed to see the
peril in which Sam stood. The car was
now only a few feet away, and Sam
was in the very middle of the track.
The noise of the boys drowned its ap
proach and, even if the motorman had
nbw looked, he could not have stopped
the car in time to avert the accident.
The principal was watching from a
second-story window, but his frantic
shouts and motions were vain. On
came the car and, without a word of
warning, Sam was struck a terrific
blow in, the Bide and thrown headlong
upon the pavement. But it was not the
car that struck him. Beslds him in
the street there lay another boy who
had taken his life In his hands to save
his enemy. It was Tom who had seen
the whole thing and realized that there
was no possibility of escape for Bam
except as he himself should act But
could he get there in time? And, even
so, was he required to risk his own life
to save a foe?
And so three boys clasped hands orrsr
a new resolve that afternoon. Two of
them would live on earth and the third
would ds.-ell in their hearts to help
them live as Jesus would. The picture
of the little Immanuel went home with
Sam as a gift from his new-found,
friend. A new one came to Tom, and
so two boys grew into noble manhood
under the holy gaze of the Boy Im
manuel.
Of court* Bam dldnt understand,
and so in that quiet room, under tns In
spiration of the loving eyes, ths Christ
mas story was told from ons boy's
heart to another. After Tom bad told
his own resolve and Sam had thus
found a reason for a good many odd
things in Tom's recent behavior. Bam
turned and whispered into Tom's ear:
"Tom, do you suppose he'd let mi try,
too?"
neck and laying his head against his
father's breast, the pent-up feelings
burst forth in one great sob. Sitting
down in the great easy chair and tak
ing the boy into his lap, the father soon
heard the whole story. He comforted
the boy and promised to call later In
the day upon the principal. Meanwhile
Tom need not go to school that after
noon.
So he went to his room while, father
telephoned to the principal, saying:
"Tom never has told me an nntruth.
Give him the benefit of every possible
doubt." Tom was debating whether or
not he ought to go to school. If he did
go, the afternoon would be wretched,
but if he stayed at home It would be
almost a confession of guilt. He looked
at the little Immanuel, and the loving
eyes spoke sympathy and courage.
Tom was no coward and so, with a
last look at the boy in the picture,
he went on his way to school, some
what comforted and yet dreading
every step.
The boys were In the street prac
ticing frfr the final football game with
the Brodericks next Saturday. Games
were now tied, and the last one would
determine the championship between
the two schools. One member of the
Bryant team was 111 and, for fear that
he would not recover - in time, Sam
Mack was put In his place for practice.
As Tom came down the street. Bam
had Just kicked the, ball, which had
landed in the midst of a howling;
group of boys. Sam, all Intent upon the
ball, was backing slowly up, . expecting
to see the ball emerge and return to
him, according to the signal given.
He did not notice that he was upon
the car track, and that a car was
rapidly descending the hill, . toward
him. The motorman -was looking be

had noticed the child shiver. The boys
stirred themselves. "I reckon he Is
cold, Dan," said Reddy. "We'd better
git outer here." Dan lifted the child to
his saddle and swung himself up with
him. Reddy ranged alongside, and they
started.
"Curtiss' kid, Reddy," said Long Dan,
tentatively.
"Yep," answered Reddy, and again
silence fell upon them.
IIL
The "old man" had no stomach for a
fight, even with despised sheepmen; so
he had taken that day to go to town,
and In conseauence was not at home
when the boys returned. For this Red
dy was grateful, for thereby he was
saved the trouble of making explana
tions; and in the old man's absence
the warming and feeding of "the kid"
seemed less of a treason. And under
the influence of the warmth and food
"Runny" became quite talkative. So it
was that before long "the kid" was tell
ing a circle of grave-faced cow-punch-
ers all about the wonderful being
known as Santy Claus, embellishing the
narrative with several fancies which
were distinctly original with himself.
They hadn't been so Intimate as this
with a child for many long days, end
the experience was wonderful. They
smoked and eyed the marvel before
them; and when "Runny" began to tell
them about Bethlehem and the wonder
ful star that the wise men saw, they
were, to a man, pictures of attention.
Most of them, with the exception â¢ of
Reddy, were more or less familiar with
the Bible story, though they had heard
it in the days of their youth, and now
the" dayB of their youth were far behind
them. /When "Runny" came to the part
about the shepherds, however, Reddy
interrupted with a sudden oathâ for
which he immediately apologized.
"Shepherds, did you say, kid? Are yo'
plum shore now they wuz shepherds?"
"W'y, course they was shepherds!

even so. that Christmas eve in the ccrw
country. Anri In the midst of the
mother's teary Joy over the lamb tl.it
was lost and found again, Reddy
turned and dug Long Dan hard in V^
ribs. *

The thought of "salt water** was cer

gulped hard and determined to "stand

they had expected to approach the
sheep camp, and one or two of them
"wondered what the "old man" would

swinging from his bronco he went for

there was the silence of a tableau. The
boy was a slenderly built child, not
more than â¬ years old. with a white face
and eyes that looked up at them wist
fully. Beside him stood Long Dan â
tall, lank and awkward even when per

and chewed tobacco like men in a

Late one afternoon a week later
Freddy and his cow-punchers turned
out of the corral at the Bar X and start
ed for Curties* sheep camp. They rode
forth In a close bunch, as men who
meant to stay together, and there was
no loud talking. A new rope, colled
and tied on Reddy's saddle, was signifi
cantly conspicuous, and each man car
ried his guns where they would be
handiest. The December sky was dark
and dreary, and the wind blew keenly
over the treeless prairie. So they trav
eled on, their hats pulled down against
the wind.
The fixEt mile of the five had hardly
been covered, when Long Dan suddenly
palled up his horse.
"Listen, fellers." he called. "What
waa that?"

were there first, endâ they hated shÂ«ep

gathering over the cattle country, and
now that a man named Curtiss had
built a sheep camp within five miles of
the Bar X, Bar X began to add Its
rumbling to the rumbling of the other
ranges.

12that "the presIdenVslttlrif behind the
saddle, naturally had to put his arm
around her waist to quiet her fear. The
sweet, beautiful something was slipping
but of Tek's life; mechanically she went
to Elizabeth, who sat gazing out of the
window and dropping on the floor be
side her hid her face in her mother's
lap. Elizabeth put her hand on Tek's
head and patted her hair, repeating
softly: "Tek-a-me,. Tek-a-me." Tek
lifted her face eagerly, but already the
hand had dropped listlessly, and Eliza
beth's eyes were gazing far Into the
unseeable where minds; go.
When Old Solem came home that
night Tek met him with: "Father, is
there any such words in the world as
Tek-a-me?* "
her heart beat; something new and
strange and sweet had slipped Into her
life. A slight cough startled them both;
he dropped her hand, but gave it a
quick pressure as his fingers let go. It
was Millie who stood before them. Tek
glanced up at her, then stared, too sur
. prised to speak. Was it Millie? Her
fair hair was done up high on the back
of her head: her sleeves were ruffled
tucked to the elbows, showing her bare
shapely arms: her dress skirt was
lengthened to the ground. She carried
a silk fringed parasolâ a relic of her
mother's Eastern finery. All unmind
ful of the stare, she smiled: "Good
afternoon, Tek: you've not been over
for. several da vs. I was afraid your
mother might *a* got worse and thought
I'd come and see If I could be of any
use. Why, Mr. Nevil, I did not expect

tips of her fingers, which he took and
bowed over, expressing his pleasure at
seeing her again. Tek had a desire to

but something was. gone wrong. She

The following afternoon when the
president came to see Tek Millie was
there before him; his ring was on her
finger and she was explaining that the
name of It was a "diamond" and that
It was worth several hundred dollars.
"I would be afraid to carry such a valu
able thing, specially when It belongs
to somebody else." Tek's attempt at in
difference would have been amusing If
it had not been pathetic. "Who said It
belonged to somebody else?/' flared Mil

wish." She did not add that she had
asked him to let her wear It and to
"wish" it on her finger. In telling any

you." "You arÂ» such a fool, Millie.
I'll saddle Princ* and taka you home."
To 'her father she called: "I'm going
to take Millie home, father; don't wait
up for me." ' ,
When Old 8olÂ«m had read his chapter
In the Bible he snapped his spectacles in
their metal case and went to bed. His
faith in his Tek was as his faith in his
Bible. And it was as Millie had said.
"While Harrison slept, dreaming per
haps,' of his rich old father in the far
away East and the gentle mother,
whose every letter prayed him to re
turn, a baker's dozen of men woke him
from 'the pleasant dream and told their

"Who chopped that tree down?" de
manded Sorrell In his severest tone. "I

don't believe It," blurted out Sorrell. She
held up the palms of her hands. "The
devil." Sorrell was genuinely suprised.
Tek put aside a fold of her short
dress; old Sanchez's present, the silver
mounted six shooter, lay In her lap.
"You ousht to be ashamed of your
selves, taking human blood on your

Millie. She stooped and wrote In the
dust of the yard. "Millie Nevil."
Tek saw the writing. "It's not as

one Quick sweep of her hand, wiped
out the name, exclaiming: "I Just wrote

"Well. I am glad
my mother's not a

a derisive glance at

The next day
brought Harrison
and the next and
the next. Old Sn
lem, with a rare
twinkle In his eyes. suggested
that his house seemed to be always on
"the president's" route; and to this day
people In that part of the country who
knew Harrison Nevll remember him
only by that title. It was wonderful
to see the blossoming of Tek In those
days; her father said to her: "My little
Tek'a getting to be a beauty." BhÂ«
hupged him.
Millie staved away a week and the
half of another. There being only a
mile of dusty level between the houses
eyes accustomed to the plains could
easily see a horse that distance, and
with but little imagination could know
cf a surety that It was hitched to a
post. "The president" sat In the shade
of the house beside Tek; their chairs
were near together; with an Impulsive
quickness he took her hand and held
it fast, moving his chair even nearer.
Tek's eyelids dropped till the laahes hid
her eyes. She did not know that eye
lashes such as hers were a beauty
mark. She was afraid he would hea*
pearance of many head of horses and
cattle could be laid at his door.
The goodly otranger Introduced
himself to the two girlsâ an unusual
happeningâ and then It was Millie who
assumed the honors. "Do you stay
long in these parts?" There was a sim
per and an inflection in her voice new
to Tek.
"I did not intend to when I came, but
now I am not so decided about It." He
spoke to Millie, but looked at Tek. Her
cheeks flushed under his boldly admir
ing eyes. She had never seen any man
like that: he was of the people of her
dreams, except that he should have rid
den a camel and have come out of the
East.
Â¦Ince you were here, and that's why
you came." To keep the desire under
her will she pushed her chair toward
Millie and ran away to bring another,
but not no far that she did not hear
Millie's voice cooing: "Tek Is a good
girl, but so impulsive," and then with
a little sigh, "but one could not expect
much else, brought up as she's been -in
this uncivilized country without any
advantages." Tek was amazed: Millie
was no longer a little girl, she was a
young lady, a species of being of which
Tek had no knowledge. She vaguely
wondered if some time she might wake
up and find herself transformed like
thatâhoping she might not. In the
world she had filled with her thought
people there were none like Millie; her
young women were princesses with
large natures and generous hearts.
When she returned to the yard carrying
the chair, which she had been slow to
do", the president stood with his hat In
his hand. Millie stood facing him, look
ing down and marking circles on the
ground with the toe of her shoe. She
looked up as Tek came out and ceased
to make the circles. . "Mr. Nevil is go
ing to take me home on his horse; the
sun is so hot." Tek glanced at the
lengthening shade of the house and felt
her shoulders hitch Into a shrug; a fear
came upon her that she "was turning
into something like Millie. A curious
ache was in her heart as she watched
them ride away. Millie screeched with
fright the minute the horse started, sp
Â¦When npar to her fifteenth birthday
an event happened in the life of Tfk.
A neighbor settled within a mile of Old
Bolem and the neighbor had a daughter
leas than one year older than Tek h<Â»r
Â¦elf. Tek's Joy was as her wide plains
stretching to the west â It reached the
horizon. The other girl's name was
Millie Grayson. she was fair-faced, fair,
haired, blue-eyed. Bhe was Just from
the States by way of the Isthmus; she
knew nothing of crossing the plains;
*he was afraid of horses and ropes and
gTjns. But the dresses Bhe wore were
as ehort as Tek's; she wore her hair in
the same fashion of two braid*,
most of all she told of a world unknown
to Tek. They walked with their arms
arouid <Â»ach others waist*, and played
with Elizabeth. Millie's friendship
was shown In protestations, Tek's. In
action. It might have pone on thus
unendingly but for the next event.
Out of a c!oud of dust In the fall of
the vear rode a younj? man, end rode
straight into both of their hearts. Then
the se'f that had lain dormant In each
girl's nature rose full grown to life.
He was young and bonnie of face and
roodly favored, this young stranger.
He wore a big Mexican sombrero, with
Bllver ornaments on the crown of It.
A gay sash was about hia waist, around
his neck a many colored silk handker
chief; the heels of his boots were high,
the trappings of his California saddle
and bridle were costly, his Jingling
rpurs were eet with Fllver. On hia ilttle
finger was a ring which glittered rain
bows In the sun. The two girls were
playing with Elizabeth in the shade of
the house when he rode up. They arose
as one and stood waiting for him to
epeak. His eyes brightened with ad
miration as they fell upon Millie's smil
ing countenance, but It was on Tele's
swarthier face and wondering blgbrown
eyes that his glance lingered; it was of
Tek he asked for a drink of water and
for directions to the living place of one

high esteem of the people thereabout,

Ills broad chest shook with an Inward
Â¦ob. "It is the ehadow of the plains,
Tek," he replied, turning his face from
her that the might not see the twitch
ing muscles about his mouth.
A eleh rustled the leaves of the pine
tree and Ehlvered into a breeze that
roared up the echoing canyon; a fleece
cf enowy white cloud drifted across the
face cf the sun; there was a warning
chilliness in its swiftly moving shadow
â and many the mile was it yet to his
promised land.
There were no county lines In Cali
fornia. In the midst of the great plain
he unyoked his oxen and pitched his
tent to stay: it was here the name of
"Old Bolem" was fixed upon him. Houru
and hours, days and days, of years,
Elizabeth sat by a door or window gaz

gentler tone In her presence and Tek
took cm his way.

They called It the haunted tree. "Old

and looked out upon the flat solitude.
"I wonder what's keeping Tek," he Bald.

and his little daughter, whose nickname

trail of Fremont; he had helped to raise

stay and let him go without her.
Merrily enough had they started on
that Journey, which tried to the utter
most the eouls of men; but when the
vast, limitless desert plains were
reached, when the terrible Bolltude
drew near and touched them, and the
train of plodding oxen and canvas cov
ered wagons were as a line of crippled
ants, a strange fear fell upon Elizabeth.

made a hollow attempt at a laugh.
"Then I will cive you back to your

He took her two hands and pressed
his lips upon them again and again.
He told her she was the only girl In the
world and that he worshiped her.

explained, in self-defense. hl3 position

womankind would not? Her face shone
with the glory which came first to the
earth when God said. "Let there be
light" Then the thing Millie had
whispered to her that day In the fall
arose before her eyes and burned in her
ears. '*It would be a crime for a girl
with a misfortune like that in her fam
ily to let a man marry her."
She drew her hands away from him
saying in a dull way: "I can never be
anything to youâ never, never, never."
No further explanation would she
make, though he pleaded with her for
hours. Finally in very desperation he
told her there was but one thine In
the world would make him rive her up.
If she said she did not love him he
would go away.
Slowly and In a Queer tone she re
peated.
"I do not." It was the first He Tek
had ever told. He arose from his seat
bv her side and stood looking down
upon her bowed head In silence.
From an uneven mound very near the
stump of the tree he gathered a hand
ful of popples, big gold and orange cup*
of sunshine; he twisted them Into a
wreath and laid it on Tek's head. From
his own finger he took the glittering
stone, which had brought such mis
understanding and slipped It on a finger
of hers. She could not hear the vow
he made. She did not lift her face as
he rode away, and he did not look back.
"Wonder what's keeping Tek?" Old
Solem repeated: at that very moment
Tek rode slowly Into the corral and dis
mounted.
"Tek," he called, coming to meet her.
A tone in his voice caused her to look
up quickly. Could It be "Old 8olem."
her fatherâ that man with the spring-
Ing 'step; that man with the smiling
face uplifted toward the sky? She
stopped and looked at him, the brldla
rein sliding from her fingers.
"Tek. I have such a Christmas gift
for you as only God could giveâ your
mother. Tek, your mother! She is all
her sweet beautiful self again. We have
talked all day and waited for you.
Every day and every night for seven
dark years I have prayed"â he stopped
short In his speechâ he was not .given
to much speaking. "Why. Tek, you have
a crown of goM thorns on your head!"
The poppies, true to their nature, had
gone to sleep in the afternoon and stood
out around her headâ a circle of sharp
pointed spikes of gold. Tek put up her
hand and touched them.
"It is the shadow of thÂ» plains,
father," she said, and started Into the
house; but involuntarily turned her
face toward the haunted tree. Then It
was that Tek'a heart beat up Into his
throat, for there was Harrison riding
at a hard gallop on her pony's tracks
no mirage, no figment of overwrought
fancy, but himself coming back to her.
She snatched the poppy thorns from
her forehead and hid them In her
bosom. The shadow of the plain* â *Â«

an unlucky speech, considering that
their errand was to make him tell. Sor
rell reached under the bed where Har
rison had slept and drew forth a saddle.
"My saddle," he called out exultantly;
"stole with my horse a month ago."
"Perhaps, Sorrell. If you would look
under the other bunk you'd find the
horse."- That speech came near turning
the scale In his favor. The laugh was
on Sorrell. One whose wrists were dec
orated with blue anchors nudged him.
saying In an undertone: "Hi say, has
'ow ye'd better peach on the gang."
There was no reply. "Ter a fine lad, a
fine lad an' brave. HI 'ate to see ye
strung."
"Come, young fellow. Just give us the
names of your friends and you go 'Scot
free.' " urged another.
"Gentlemen, as I have said, I know
nothing to tell, and If I were what you
think me, I would be a poor sort If I
brought my comrades all to the noose
Just to save my own neck."
"That's brave talk, fellows," said Sor
rell, before another had time to speak;
"he'll sing a different tune when the
rope Is round his neck. Come on. It'll
be sun up now before we get to the tree.
He' can sav his prayers as we rida

ing nearer that's high enough from the
ground to hang a man on. I might es
cape on the way." "No danger," Sor
rell smiled significantly.
One of the things he hated Harrison
for was that Harrison insistently said
Sor-rell Instead of Sorrell, the name
with the accent on the first syllable be
ing the exact shade of his hair. From
Orton's cabin to the hollow where the
haunted oak stood was but a short two
milesâ a hollow where the poppies grew
larger and longer stemmed than else
where and the alflllarilla grew ranker.

tain top when the cavalcade, the dis
pensers of Justice and the Judge, drew
near. Harrison's hands were tied be
hind him. To say what was In his
thoughts would be to say that which
no roan would tell. At each man's belt
the handle of a revolver showed and
cross-wise before him he carried a rifle,
no sign of relenting In any faceâ unless
indeed. It were In his who wore the
blue tattoo on his wrists: he had been
as Jolly a tar as sailed under her
Majesty's colors, and the courage of the
man with his hands tied pleased him
mlghtly.
He that was Sorrell both of name and
hair stopped the long easy lope of his
horse in one bound. He raised himself
high In his stirrups and looked ahead.
The others stopped simultaneously.
"What Is It?" What do you seer* came
In several voices. It was nearing the
end of the days of the "vlgilants." There
were Sheriffs and posses with the law
at their backs already in the land.
Unconsciously each man wondered
about the fleetness of his horse. "What
do I see?" replied Sorrell. "See noth
ing. That's it â what's become of that
tree? It was here at sundown last
night. Has the earth swallowed it?
Does any man of you see It?"
They looked up and shook their
heads; no tree was In slprht.
There was a quick jingle of belled
spurs, a clatter of hoofs and the horses
were halted as one on the rim of the
hollow. The tall oak with its gallows
arms lay stretched on the earth. Every
branch and limb of It broken In the
crash of Its fall. On the fallen trunk

was at hand.
In the twilight of Christmas eve Tek
sat watching the full moon rise; hear

looked out and saw Millie standing
under the window, her eyes swollen and
red with weeping. It was the first time
Tek had met her face to face since
Millie had said the thing which
scorched Tek's soul. But Millie's face
was distressed, and. Tek was tender
hearted. "What's the matter, Millie?"

many fears, she told her trouble.

BOOKS FOR THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING
BY ROBEil^W-^
FOR SMALL
SOCKS
OOKS win not go into Christmas
B stockings, as a rule, but if you
will remember it was always to
ward the mysterious piles heap
ed up under the stockings that
you made your first frantic dive
on those early Christmas mornings of
the far away past. Books will go Into
those piles. Books should go into those
piles, and lots of them.
In summer the small boy is certain
that Fourth of July is the holiday par
excellence, but as the sun begins to
hang lower and the crisp mornings
commence to come visions of Christ
mas begin to loom larger and more
large In his head until on that fateful
eve. when there are bo many bulky
packages in the hall window box and
he Is sent. upstairs to bed earlier than
usual, he is positive that there is no
day in the whole year like Christmas.
Really he Is right, for there Is no time
for the children like good old Decem
ber 25. In the early morning there are
the toys, the games and the candy,
then the wild hallos and horn blowings
In the streets, and finally after the din
ner there Is the comfortable curling up
in the big chair over near the window
with the new book propped on knee.
The toys get the first notice, but the
Christinas book is the last love and the
strongest.
Yearly the great harvest of Christ
mas books for the young folks is be
coming more and more rich and of
widely varying kind. For the toddlers
of 3 and 4 there are colored pictures
worthy of a frame of old oak.xind a
place In the library; your boy and
girl receive gilt and leather bound
volumes which their elders hardly
dare touch without a caution. Ver
ily this Is the day of the youngster.
Pterhaps the most beautiful speci
men of a child's book which has come
out this Christmas 6eason is "The
Book of the Child." by Jessie Wilcox
Smith and Elizabeth Shlppen Green,
the two standard illustrators of chil
dren. Beautiful color plates of unus
ual b1zÂ« depict In the remarkably life
like style of the two artists the many
little tragedies and comedies of a day
In a little one's life. A quaint Illu
minated tÂ£Xt accompanies the illustra
tions.
Under other covers Miss Jessie Wil
cox Smith gives us "Rhymes of Real
Children" In an equally charming
etyle. Here Miss Smith interprets in
color the amusing little children's
verses supplied by Betty Sage. The
verses are not too old to interest a
Bix-year-old and yet every one of
them causes a smile to come to the
lips of the "grown-up" who reads
them.
Stin, for the very young fojks there
are a half-dozen more of these serio
comic picture books, which eecm sud
denly to have sprung Into pop
ularity with the Infants. There is "The
Life of a Wooden Doll," by Lewis Sax
by, wherein that spirited individual ap
pears in the various scenes devised for
her by her Email mistress. She is evi
dently a good housekeeper, with a task
for every day; she amuses herself fash
ionably, receives her stiff -legged guests
with, a pleasing boxwood smile and is
the possessor of a stuffed cat, remark
able for her geniality. Then there are
the ever fresh Denslow's picture books,
Â¦with their uproarious picture mirth.
"The Golliwogs Circu3" presents those
interesting citizens In new pranks for
the delight of their young admirers.
"LT1 Verses for Ll'l Fellers," by George
Vere Hobart, will make good rocking
chair songs when the sandman comes
around.
In the realms of fairy there are plen
ty of tempting volumes for little girls,
and boys, too, who have yet to see their .
first suspenders. "Wally Walderoon."
by Joel Chandler Harris, tells of a little
old man who possesses the wonderful
story-telling machine. "Sweetest Su
ean," "Buster Brown" and all of the
rest of Harris* dream children pay
Wally a visit and hear the magic of his
magical contraption. Mrs. Carter Har
rison has written a particularly dainty
book called "The Star Fairies," in
which there are to be found a half
dozen tales of all sorts of elves and
fays. "Six Giants and a Griffin," by
Blrdsall Otis Edey, Is not half bo ter
rifying a story as would be Imagined
from the title. The giants all belong to
the union, hence are good giants.
For the growing boy who would
scorn a fairy book as being "sissy,"
the Christmas output of the publish
ers offers a wide choice. Perhaps 'the
best books one can put into a grow
ing boy's hands are "Following the
Deer*' and\"A Little Brother to the
Bear." by William J. Long. In these
books, as In his other nature studies,
Long puts before the eyes of his read
ers the plain, unvarnished life of the
woods In such a manner as to cause a
strong feeling of kinship with these
wlldllngs to spring up In the heart of
any healthy minded boy or man. After
reading these books, to shoot down
one of the four-footed would seem a
sacrilege. "Four-Footed Trails," by -
Mabel Osgood Wright, Is equally as
good a book of the same type. .â¢
Edwyn Sandy's "Trapper Jim" may"
safely be termed the new book for boys '
of greatest practical value and useful
ness. "The best book for boys on the
grand outdoors" Is a phrase frequently
employed by the book's reviewers. Mr.

Sandys has spent. much of his life in
the woods, hunting, fishing, shooting,
painting, trapping, or. simply camping
out for his own quiet pleasure and re
freshment. "Trapper. Jim" is a story;
but the â¢ author has devoted â¢ himself
whole-heartedly to letting j his boy
readers into the secrets of all the
sports and interests that center around
woods and lakes and streams and
fields, even including sparring, and
stuffing wild creatures that have been
killed.
Cyrus Townsend Brady has written
a good book for boys in "In the War
With Mexico." This stirring_ story of
war and adventure, the second to, ap
pear In the VBoys of the Service.", has
a vivid historical setting of uncommon
interest. The amusing and exciting ex
periences of Midshipman Nod Denton
of the Wasp's Nest and his two sailor
comrades, ashore as well as afloat, af
ford, also, a striking Â¦panorama of our
war with Mexico; and It is a auestlon
whether his experiences aboard the
U. S. S. Somers, with the story, of the
.mutiny and the account of her wreck,
or his march with Scott upbn : the City
of Mexico, are the' most absorbing. The
reader meets, ' In . the': beginnings of
their careers, , Grant, Lee, McClellan,
Beauregard, kearny and other famous
generals of a later period.
Every boy likes to read \ about him
self or to recognize in the tale of some
other small boy Just -what he would do
himself were he to be similarly situ
ated. . There Jore, jttie' freckle-faced
youngster will welcome " Johnnie,'? the
story of a boy, by E. .. O. Laughlln.
Johnnie is not a good little; boy, nor a
very bad little boyâ Just a - boy who
would scare his sister with a. live garter
snake or make a botch of his "exercise"
on the last day of school like any other
boy. Any. boy can find his own picture
in "Johnny." . . .
Without doubt the sweetest story for
girls, and girls' mothers as well, which
has come out this year is "The Awaken
ing of the Duchess." .In this little story
Francis Charles points only, too strong
a moral, and yet nothing of the didac
tic intrudes upon the thread of the nar
rative. It is ;the story of the awaken
ing of a mother's love for her only
daughter after. for many years locking
her out of her. heart with the glided
key of society. The book is a strong
call to some sorts of mothers. â¢
- "Aunt Jimmy's Will" is another ex
cellent story" for both girls and' their
elders. This attractive story details the
adventures'of . a brave, true-hearted lit
tle girl,- named Bird O'Mara. At, the
opening of the story Bird is left an
orphan- by the death- of her, father, a
painter of- much cultivation and refine
ment, who has : spent * the last years of
his ' llf e : in "Â¦ the cauntry. A half-brother
of ' her father/comes, for .her and takes
her. ; sorely :;agalrist- her" will,\ down' to
New York, where Bird has to live with
people who do not understand how to
get happiness out of life, or how to get
happiness Into It for others. Â¦ *
These, then, O distracted Christmas
shopper, are a few of the best that can
be had for the young ones at home or
in others' homes. Remember that every
other day in the year you are buying
books for your own reading and start
the young â¢ ones right by buying good
books for their edification.
IN LARGER
ONES
FOTallfor the dhildren are the
books, offered to the; Christmas
buyer. For the gentle lover; of
good books, whose purse strings
will not nearly, encompass his
o'erweenlng affection, the holi
day bookstalls offer a refined and ex
quisite torture, f One is really resolved
with Franklin to wear the old coat
and buy the new book. . .â¢ .
The j book trade this Christmas pre
sents some unusual features. One of
these Is the absence of the, cumber
some volumes, elaborately, illustrated,
which ' used to . pass under the generic
-title of "gift, books." Despite the fact
that .there " are several folios of draw
ings by popular : artists which still
catch the fancy, the tendency this year
has been in the. direction of quality at
the expense of quantity. A few poems
of Browning, the choicest bits of Ten
nyson,' are gathered into a small and
dainty; book of handmade paper, with
a rich leather binding, and sold as a
much, more acceptable gift than the
overgrown "gift book"' of past sea
sons.-. â¢ . w^. : - % - : t';f-'*
' The question of what books are hav
ing the largest holiday sales admits of
varying answers; some say. that the
solid reading has : the most demand,
others swear by fiction. There Â¦ are
'some voracious fiction readers who
greedily consume every new novel as
It appears and . for, whom a little salt
of sincerity In the form of good his
tory or biography would add a much
needed condiment to * their literary
pabulum.
Of ..this/ class of substantial books
the two which can be called pre-emi
nently the best of the year are John
Morley's ."Life\>f William Ewart Glad
stone" and Senator . Hoar's
raphy . of Seventy Years." , John Mqr
ley's biography of the great commoner
is as faithful a record. of a life as ever
thfi assiduous Boswell was capable of,
but < It *; is also written with; such a
knowledge of the political atmosphere
In which Gladstone .moved and with
such accuracy in all the enormous de
tail of his public life that it may well
stand as a history of the last quarter
century of the Victorian asre. Besides
Gladstone the statesman, Morley pic
tures Gladstone the man in a manner
which makes the reader see him in as
intimate a light as if his conception
was born of -. personal acquaintance
with the great Englishman. Senator
Hoar's story of his own life is the dual
record of his private' life 'and long
public career. In this Hoar does not
hesitate to express his candid opinion
about some of the men and events
connected with ' Congress . In- bygone
years. His opinions are always force
ful./ Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦.Â¦Â¦; ; :.; .- â¢ ->_.Â¦;
Of .books .of travel and* exploration,
Sven : :Hedi'n's new- book,' "Central Asia
and â¢ Thibet," ' is easily the leader this
year. This - book is the j first adequate
description of his remarkable expedi
tion, and Its accomplishments, an expe
dition bo rich In adventure as well as
solid achievement that he has - been
called by. the London press "the mod
ern knight-errant of science." All these
experiences he 'Â¦: j describes . graphically,
including, among, others, his several
narrow Â¦ escapes from death; his" navi
gation of 1500 miles in a ferry-boat, his
discovery' of the remains of cities dat
ing from the 1 third century Â¦ A. D., with
translations of 1 Chinese 'manuscripts
there unearthed : his crossing of ths
mountains of. Thibet with the largest
and strongest caravan which has ever
traversed that country, his extraordi
nary Journey in disguise toward Lhasa,
his discovery, by Thibetan spies warned
of his intention to enter Lhasa; his cap
tivity and escort by 600 Thibetans, -his
conflicts with them "and his voyage In
an English folding .boat' over: twelve
Thibetan .lakes.
Sir" Gilbert, Parker has contributed
"Old Quebec: the Fortress of New
France" to the season's list of .standard
books on travel. Americans who make
even a brief sojourn in that friost indi
vidual of Canadian cities feel (the effec
tive and potent spell which if casts on
all: who have lived within its curious
limits. Many of the episodes and Inci
dents in its history are dramatically ef
fective, and through good use of these
episodes in Its founding, in its struggles
and in its. Intimate connection with the
most * stirring j period in; the history of
the continent, the author has been able
to write^ a charming book.
A somewhat tardy echo of .the Boxer
movement, yet a fascinating, book with
al, is the posthumous publication of the
letters " written' from'* China . by Wilbur
J. Chamberlln to his family. Under, the
title "Ordered : to: China"" there are
gathered together the epistles which
this brilliant: correspondent of the New
York f, Sun penned during ', the .; heat" of
the troublesome times following the" re- ,
lief - of ' the * legations by troops * of the
powers. The stamp of , the good news
paper man is : uppn each one of these
crisp, vivid recountals of 'what v.*as
daily passing before his eyes. . He
Â¦writes: to his .wife and sister with as
faithful adherence to the stirring de
tails of the Boxer outbreaks as he
,would show in the reports to* his paper.
Unfortunate it was that death came to
this faithful worker in the pursuit of
his duty. '-?:']
There is one recent book which has
not attracted the attention due to* It
and that Is "The Thoughtless Thoughts
of Carlsabel." This is a collection of
thirty little satires upon modfern foibles
which may well stand comparison with
Charles Lamb's delightful gibes at pop
ular misconceptions. . They were first
published In the Baltimore Sun, but
now are given the covers they so well
merit.
Isa Carrington Cabell, for that is the
solution of the rebus. which fathers the
book, is evidently the cherriest of op
timists., but is endowed with that rare
trait of seeing the. humor in every-day
commonplaces. The' author has the
trick' of drawing the reader on to con
cur with each, of her arguments until
the final point j is ready for clinching
and then turning the laugh on him by
giving the question a preposterous so
lution. Such delicate wit as is
hibited in "Thoughtless Thoughts is
rare nowadays." ; Â¦ -V- z \
For those whose old mortar board
still hangs In a corner of the library
there are two little booklets of verse
which should. carry. ..theirV appeal to

I IToe motto of Oc&eral Grant teemt Jo
It was my good fortune to be present
in the late seventies at a Christmas
dinner given to General Sherman at a
frontier post. The great soldier was in
a reminiscent mood. "I am," said he,
"a better soldier than Grant. I was a
closer student, had a wider experience
and took greater interest in military
matters, both in the army and while
I was In civil life. But I have not a
patient or a phlegmatic temperament.
During the war I was often unable to
sleep, because of my apprehensions of
what the enemy might do. Now Grant
always made up his mind as to what
be would do hJTpp^if, and then be never
â¢earned to care about the plans of the
enemy* ,
I was one of the several ruests who
were entertained on Christmas day
many years ago at a hospitable house
in a mountain city In California, I was
there to deliver a lecture before the Ly
ceum Society. The otner guests were
Methodist clergymen, assembled to
assist in the ceremony of dedicating a
new church edifice. One of the guests
was Bishop Mathew Simpson of Indi
ana, the most eloquent of all the pulpit
orators of his generation. Another was
Rev. M. C. Briggs of San Francisco,
second only to Bishop Simpson as a
speaker. A third was Rev. Dr. Peck of
Sacramento. He was a broad man, al
most as broad as he was longâ five feet
two from head to heels and five feet
two in girth.
"Brother Peck," said our host, "shall
I not rive you another piece of tur
key?" "Thank you. brother." was the
response, "I believe that I will take
another piece, for I have got to preach
this evening."
"And I," interposed a meager little
young Irishman who had Just been ad
mitted as a divine,- "I will also take
another piece, for I have got to listen
to him."

preacher, some years afterward on the

A mighty panorama unrolled before
At a Christmas dinner at a mining
camp in Arizona our mess had for its
guest of honor a clorgyman who was
a bachelor, a patient little soul and a
sincere Christian. We gave him the

Under cover of the noise Uncle Frank
led them away, silent, through the
empty rooms, to where the deserted
Christmas tree sheltered only Minna,
cooing German cradle songs to her
sleeping baby.
, "Wait and Â«ee. Bob, my boy."
"This coal makes dandy ships, don't
it? A lot of coal would be a. fine pres

"Want to see how It goes, Bob? Here,
I'll work it for you. It's a little catchy
at first. Yes, Indeed, Mr. Robertson,
we had more fun than a little getting
this ready, I assure you. Quite com
plete, isn't It?"
Uncle Christopher began to Jusrgl*
with the Japanese outfit, to the Intense
delight of the servants. The aunties
and Mr. Ferris played with the engine,
explaining its mechanism to the won
dering grandfathers. Grandma Wheel
er marveled at the French dissecting
puzzle. Bobbert's mother . happily
guarding the candy, laughed at the
baby, who. harnessed Into the dos col
' lar, pranced along before her father,
waving tha colored balls In the air, a
woolly lamb under her free arm. The
merry moments passed.
Suddenly Grandfather Wheeler looked
cp from the bird book, which he was
sharing with Uncle Frank. "But where
is Robertson Jr.?" he inquired mildly.
They stared. "Why, right here." they
said. But he was not right there.
Uncle Frank looked about compre
hensively at the relatives and smiled a
superior smile. Then his eye fell on
the bird book in his lap, and the smile
changed its quality.
He glanced at the ring of servant*.
"And where is David?" he added. Sud
denly he sprang to his feet. "Coma
on!" he said. "We'll find him. Don't
make a noise â walk softly, now."
And still holding the presents, they
trooped after him through tha hall.
Uncle Frank paused a moment, nod
ded, and made room for Bobbert's
father, while the grandfathers crowd
ed up and the aunties peeped" under
and over.
' On ~thc floor before the well swept
kitchen hearth sat David. Beside him,
a little space away, squatted Bobbert,
n. long black hockey stick in his hand.
Between them were arranged large
pieces of coal from the hod, arranged
in. what appeared to be nlnepln pat
terns.
"I shall attack from the right at day
break. You'll see what the mosquito
fleet can do, David. Your clumsy

David prefixed the title of respect In
public but his private relations with
Bobbert had been anything but formal.
Aunt Kate, dancing with impatience.
had begun to detach the presents from
the lower boughs, and soon they were
piling up around him.
"Master Robertson Wheeler. Master
Robertson Wheeler â oh, Bobbert. that's
Â» whopping fine present. Miss Doro
thea Wheeler. Slehst du, raein susses

what Uncle Ritch sent you. Bob! He
forgot how you had grown!"
They were laughing, explaining,
thanking, eating, all at once.
"And the candy mother*ll keep till to
morrow. Now, Bob, see! Under the
tree!"
The engine rattled proudry forth. The
uncles and annts fell upon it.
"There! I told you It wasn't oiled

-W Ms Spen carOf SHIRT waist makes the most ao
f I ccptable of all Christmas pres
f 1 ents, end for several reasons:
X First, it is a thing- which Is al
ways needed; second, it shows a
direct personal thoughtfulness, and
third, it Is the fad to give a shirt waist
for a holiday jrfft.
Beyond thi* there Is a something
about the new waists which affords an
opportunity for a personal touch, a
chance to embroider, to cross stitch, to
lagot, to decorate In some way which
will give the waist an Individuality
which Is very flattering to the one who
receives it.
While the silk waist, the waist of taf
feta, the peau de sole, the ombre silk
and the crepe de chlae and all the other
fancy evening fabrics are dainty and
desirable in every way, still it must be
told that, after all, It Is the wash waist
which holds first place In popularity.
And for a. Christmas gift this Is par
ticularly true.
The wash waist, while it may be very
lnexpeneive and usually is at this time
of year, can also be costly; and to cay
that you have purchased a tubable
winter waist Is not to arcuÂ» that you
have bought It cheap, on the bargain
counter.
The new cotton waists, far from be
ing Inexpensive, are positively high In
price, . and some of them are as dear
as velvet, while a great many make
taffeta seem like 80 cents in .matter of
cost. ' ,
These very expensive cotton waists
are In cheviot, in cotton canvas and in
very thick Marseilles. They como in
very heavy weight and are as warm
as wooL Many are. to use a' colloquial
ism, "as heavy as a board."
The ureat virtue of these waists is
that they will wash. Made of stuff that
will not shrink nor fade and which will
not lose its texture in the tub, they
can be cast into the water every week
and scrubbed with abandon. On being
taken out they are pressed and when
the process is completed they look, if
not like new, at least very nearly as
good.
The New Tub Waists.
In the tubable shirt waists can be
counted the heavy new,' mercerized
stuffs, with a wonderful glory of finish;
and there can be mentioned the glazed
white cottons, with brocaded figures,
which cannot be told front brocaded
satin at a distance.
The cotton canvases come in all col
ors and are really wonderful in the per
fection of their weave. They are love
liest in Gobelin and in wood brown and
in Indian red. But for that matter they
look well in any shade. They look very
soft, but when taken in the hand they
will be found as heavy as the stoutest
wool.
The fact that Jack Frost arrives in
winter, bringing with him the nipping
days, has hitherto kept women from
wearing the wash shirt waist In I De
cember. But with the advent of the
heavier cotton fabrics this objection
has been waved aside. And they who
could not think of puttlneTon the wash
able fabrics in winter thne are now
reveling in them.
Perhaps the prevailing tendency to
mannishness in woman's attire has led
the winter girl to copy her brother in
this respect: "If John wears a wash
able shirt In the winter time, why not'
Mary?" asks the winter girl. And, fail
ing to answer the Question; she has
wrought out a satisfactory solution.
Perhaps when the truth is told tha
tubable waist is more welcome in. the
winter time than In the summer. In
the winter a heavy coat Is worn and It
Is certainly Jarring to a woman's feel
ings to put on a heavy cloak over "a
nice waist. There is always the thought
that the waist Is being crushed into
nothingness. and its trimmings ground
into ribbons. The wash waist, onythe
other hand, being plainer In its con
struction and stouter in . its constitu
tion, suffers nothing from the crushing
and comes out as fine as ever after a
day's wear under the fur coat. . *
All Waists Are Blouse.
And. a still further argument in favor
of the wash.. waist is its prettiness.' for
it is certainly made upon the very pret
tiest plan. In its shape it. leaves noth
ing at all to bo desired, for thin girls
or fat; and In its stylo it is more than
excellent. . ,
Both the thin woman and the fat wo-'
man can wear a waist that is very full
. upon the ' bust, and to secure this : full
ness there are plaits laid < upon \ the
shoulder to widen later Into a Glbsori
ian- front. Or there are box plaits
which give the fullness , at the bust
where it Is most needed.
AH waists, thin and thick, have the
full blouse effect directly over the belt
in the middle of the front. . But this
pouch, instead of _ being wide and
heavy, Is narrow and rather pointed
Bets. Tee slide. wnfeÂ£ f> ft* Inches
long and not more than two lnehaa la
width, is arranged upon the bait so
that it curves around the baok. ThÂ«
buckle is fastened in tha middle of the
front.
The woman who wants to bÂ« Tery
fashionable upon very little, and who
cannot even afford the wtdo satin rib
bons that come for belting", can maka
herself a crush belt by cutting up an
old moire skirt or wajst. Let it Ij4
doubled, stitched upon both edges ant>*
if possible, let It be made on the bias.
It need not be shaped, for It will adÂ« Â».
just Itself to the figure. It should bo /
four inches wide at least and should bÂ«
crushed down to the shape of the waist.
Those who make these belts at homo
will be more successful If they take
heed to a few small Items. One of these
is that it Is best to adjust tha buckle
after the belt is on. Arrange the belt
aroucd the waist, slip the buckle In
place, hook it and then tighten it prop
erly. A natural dip will bo secured
thus which v?ould not be possible were
the buckle sewed on before th'e belt had
been- shaped to the figure.
Do not think that because the wash
shirt waist is In vogue tha wool waist
is out of style, for this is far from be
ing the case. The new wool waists ara
not only very well made, but thev are
splendidly adapted to the figure, com
â¢ Ing in all the neat and becoming pat
terns and made In the v#ry latest styles.
There are silk flannels that look 90
much like satin that you could not tell
the difference, and there are soft wools
' that are the exact understudy of glazed
silk. These come in all the pretty col
ors, but are at their best In the pastel

selections. - t
colored leather; they come Tn red, or
green, or white. These belts are very
neat with the tailored waists and have
the marvelous advantage of being very
easy to adjust, and they wear well also.
The Question with the narrow belt is
one of diplomacy. How shall one pre
serve the diplomatic relations between
shirt and waist so that the two shall
not part company at the critical mo
ment, leavng the belt in a position
which can be described as on the fence
and betwixt and between?
The Countes3 de Castellane has a
French modiste who makes her shirt
bands of suede, exactly the color of the
leather belt : which is to cover them.
Now should they part company it
would be no harm at all.
But Itijs the wide belt which is de
cidedly fin," and this comes in kid, in
suede, in soft morocco and In satin.
The belt may be a full finger depth In
width and It. can be a little wider if one
prefers.' There is no buckle used in
the back, but the front is fastened with
a,blg harness buckle.
The modish colors are moleskin
brown, automobile and " Indian reds,
mushroom brown, ecru, castor gray
and all the odd or off shades of the
paler colors.
In adjusting a wide belt for the first
time one should have" a full length mir
ror in which to view the back of the
waist, for it is a fact that. the leather
will . take . folds of Its own, and . unless
guided by hand these folds will be un
graceful. They should be folded eor
rectly and each time the belt Is put on
It will take precisely the same lines.
A woman who dresses very well
makes It a practice to spread her suede
and rough leather' belts wide and
smooth In the back, while. on the sides
she crumples them a very little, let
ting them crush down fiat in front.
This gives the jwaist a very pretty slope
and makes the figure look trim.

Christmas gift can select one of the
new buckles and slides which come in

by \ a ; very deep . cuff ' which extends
down < to the knuckles. This cuff must
be unbuttoned to admit of the hand
slipping through.
Another sleeve,- just as pretty and
more in ' favor, la j the sleeve which Is
the genuine shirty waist -sleeve with
narrow cuff. The cuff fastens with a
long point which laps over and is
caught with a little button or with a
hook. .
Miss Roosevelt's Luncheon Waists.
Miss Alice Roosevelt . is reveling in
pretty, shirt waists this fall, for each
time she < appears in public she wears
a new one.' She chooses them for lunch
eons, morning calls and 5 o'clock teas.
They are in every shade that can be
imagined, with a preference for the
tans, the browns, the deep reds, and,
all the shadow tones. /
One waist was a marvel in prettiness,
being in an Indian red canvas worked
by hand down each side of the front.
The design chosen was the conven-r
tior.al chrysanthemum, which was car
ried out In rose colors with the stems
in green'. Surely this gave an oppor
tunity for a. very nice exhibit of handi
work and the woman who is handy
with the needle could do a great deal
In the way of embroidering her shirt
waist fronts.
Another wash waist, worn recently at
a girl's luncheon In Washington, show
ed bands of narrow canvas, put oh as
strappings down each side of the front,
each band stitched with machine
stitching upon each edge. â¢
A great many of the tubable waists
are trimmed with brass buttons, which
are removed for the tub's sake. And
the putting on of the buttons* is one
of the self-appointed tasks of the win
ter girl.-
THey are taking the old white waists
of last summer and are working them
down each aide with a great pattern in
dark red, either a big diamond pattern '
or a Greek scroll. Then, down the
front, they are setting brass military
buttons, thus giving the finishing win-:
ter touch to , the "waist which is to be
worn until Christmas &nd afterward.
Still another luncheon waist, also
worn by a Washington girl, was trim
med with simulated^ box plaits, very
narrow and running from the shoulder
seam right down to the belt. The waist
was buttoned Invisibly under a wide
box plait,. and upon this plait were
groups of .brass buttons, In little rows
of three each.
The Christmas Waists.
1 If you are, going to" give a shirt waist
for a Christmas present it is essential
that it be one that has, the touch of
your own hand upon it. The personal;
thought is thus expressed and, antici
pating this, there come the most beau
tiful; waists, of ;very heavy quality,
with' a large pattern stamped upon the
front. This can be worked by hand In
silks or in wash cottons, until the waist
is a work o'f art, as well as of utility..
I â¢ Mrs. -T. C. Platt and Mrs. Chauncey
M.Depew are. both adepts at waist em-,
broidery, and the former is seldom seen
without a needle threaded , In "coarse
cotton, pulling: the threads through the
stock which matches ,ner. latest waist.
She wears Â¦ the '-- Indian f r colors a ; great
deal and is very partial to the Indian
reds . arid .the Indian : blues, while deft
touches of white are used to bring out
Â¦the tones '. more prominently.
" It must not be supposed that the
fancy for embroifierin* these heav:
cotton waists has driven out the open
work fad, for on the contrary there are
more waists trimmed with openwork
than ever. A great many of these have
lace pieces set In, with the foundation
cut out beneath the lace, while others
have the lace applied and a little hem
stitching is used around each lacÂ© piece.
Wheels of Indian manufacture can be
bought and applied to the yokes of
waists. t while, for the nicer waists, the
Mexican thread wheels are Ideal.
The wash waist goes beautifully with
all the separate skirts, and the fact
that it comes In all colors makes It one
of the most desirable dress adjuncts of
the season. .. r
The open' canvas materials, while
they look very thin, come heavily
lined, or so arranged that they are worn
over a heavy lining. The.y are, for the
most part, in cream color; and the na
ture of their weave Is such that they
admit of the most elaborate needle
work. Roses, Armenian patterns and
/Assyrian designs can all be worked In
the criss-cross mesh of this cream col
ored canvas.
Christmas Belt and Stock.
If you want to give or make your
girl friend a Christmas present of a
belt or,, a stock, with or without the
shirt waist, you cannot do better than
study the new fashions in these articles
before venturing forth, for 'It is a fact
that 'these have so greatly changed In
the last few months as to be scarcely
recognizable.
A stock made of calf 6kin, with the
red hair of the calf left on, was a nov
elty recently seen. This crossed In the
back, while the straps came around
to the front and fastened under a har
ness buckle. " Another leather stock
was made of morocco of the same de
sign. It was round and straight and
the ends of the straps Blipped through
each other in the back and were buck
led, in the front in very neat fashion.
... A great many of the new stocks are
of the "twice around", variety and con
sist of a very long canvas strip, which
â¢ is passed twice around the neck and
knotted in front The moat approved
knot shows one end passed in under
the other, while both ends fall to the
waist. In over-and-over style. â¢
Then there are the very dainty made
and-stitched bishop stocks, with varia
tions, one of which has a turn-over
edge with space for a ribbon to berun
j under. Another shows the ends com
ing together In thefront with a button.
It is a fact that women particularly
like the neat, stiff neck fixings, and for
that reason the linen collar with the
ribbon stock continues In favor. It la
possible now to buy these ribbon stocks,
made in layers of silk, with a knot of
silk in the front,, the whole intended for
wearing with a stiff linen collar.
' The linen stocks that are round in the
front and fastened In the back are^ueen
a great deal/ The back is closed invis
ibly, while the front haa two or three
points, one overlapping the other, with
a button in the center. ;â¢.'â¢;
All of these linen stocks afford ample
opportunity for hand work, and so can
be made .up into charming', little
Christmas testimonials. .
The Question . of a Belt.
Â¦Â¦Â¦V'. The belt ; Question la one that .worries
woman from season to season and' from
day to day. A belt is so essential to; a
shirt waist, yet so difficult to manage.

râ¢1 There is a great deal of home-
JL made furniture in the land
these days. But, as It does
not look like home-made furniture nor
like amateur work, it can be forgiven.
More than that It is welcome, for a
great deal of It is as pretty as it can
be; and a great deal better than could
possibly be bought for the same money.
Among the surprises of Christmas
day will be the Quantity of hand-made
furniture which is brought forth; and
those who are fortunate enough to re

which is well worthy an honorable
place In a modern home.
Woman turned carpenter a long
time ago. But she was timid. She
worked with nothing 'at alL A soap
box. a few barrel Etaves and some
rough boards and broom sticks were
her materials; and with these she
evolved so-called furniture which did
not amount to much from point of
beauty or usefulness.
But the lady carpenter of to-day
works quite differently. It is a story of
the lady and the hammer and with the
deft Instrument she turns out many a
handsome bit. She calls It new art
furniture. But, called by any name, it
is pretty and extremely usefuL
The lady carpenter, when she gets
ready to work, makes out her schedule.
She must have bo many shelves of such
Â«ize and thickness. They must be of
a certain wood finished In a certain
way. Then she needs the -mechanical
parts, the sliding shelves, the drawers,
the racks and the moldings.
When ehe has made out her list she
adds the trimmings, the little brass
knobs, the fleur delis in brass, the
great ornamental locks and the im
mense hinges which are now the fan
cy; and she adds a plentiful supply ot
great ornamental nails, for it Is now
the style to have all the materials
show when the piece of furniture is
complete.
Grandmother's Clock.
A beautiful piece of Christmas furni
ture is the grandmother's clock.
Fifty years from now it will be, not
grandfather's dock, but the clock of
grandmother.
Grandmother's dock, now being built,
is built to last; and In the days to com*
It will be an ornament for the front
hall, the back hall, or the parlor.
The "grandmother" who Is now mak
ing the clock is a young girL She is not
a grandmother yet. But she wants a
dock, a dock that will last, a dock for
keeps.
"I am so tired of frail things," says
she, "let me build me something that
will endure."
It Is to be a piece of holiday work and
the making will take time. It must not
be an ordinary clock, but one that will
last forever, a dark wood, heavy dock
with a pendulum that wags and a face
that can be seen all over the house.
"It must have a pretty face," says
she, "for a dock with a homely face is
a constant reproach. And It must
strike. The striking of the dock is so
comforting. No matter whether the
strokes are welcome or not. no matter
whether they are a Joy or a bitter
sweet. That clock of mine must strike
the hour."
Most women can put together a clock
frame from a diagram. J8ut those who
cannot can call help. The carpenter,
that friend of woman, is called into the
business and, after many consultations,
many trips backward and forward,
many measurements, many efforts to
understand, and many misunderstand
ings, be finally gets the idea. And
when a carpenter once gets the idea the
battle is half won.
The clock Is made and a beauty it Is.
Its back is flat. Its sides are out off
But these are not the clock faces that'
wear well. You want a face with a
hard wood finish and with brass let
ters, or letters of silver and hands that
correspond. This sort of a clock is not
very expensive and can be rigged up by
any clockmaker in a few days! You
pay the price and he makes the clock go.
A tall eleg-ant clock is just the thing
for a Christmas present.
How much does it cost? Well, there's
the Question. You see It depends upon
the woman, the carpenter and the bar
gaining propensities of both. There are
carpenters who will let you buy the ma
terial and will work for you, by the day,
upon It, getting it done as soon as pos
elble. And there are others, conscience
less fellows,'; who ' will . demand that
you let? them buy the stuff, and p^V*
it, and charge you anything at alL â¢Â¦--.â¢Â¦ -Â¦*Â»
It Is ' all ; according to the kind ot a
man you getâ Just like any ether lot*
teryl :
You can put together leas ambitious
clocks, or you can make a Â¦winging
clock by /attaching chains to a circular
framework and setting, a dock inside.
Beautiful . hanging, clocks are made to
be suspended between the parlor and
the dining-room; and there are hanging
clocks ; that ; are just the thing â¢ for the
staircase hall, or over the big fireplace.
They/ take, clocks and stain , them In
dark colors and hand paint them. But,
if you do this, get the spirit of Michael
Angrelo to help you, or gtt a Raphael'
to hold your hand; for a hand-painting
that is not good is .very, bad Indeed.
especially when it be perpetuated In
diagonally to make dear little three
cornered shelves tor bric-a-brac. And
down below Is a wide shelf for books.
At the top shines the face, a great
round thing, a face so dear that you
want to hug It, and over the face there
is room for bric-a-brac "I shall deco
rate that face," says the girl, "the
bands shall be cold and I shall paint
upon it the year in ' which It was
made."
When the carpenter's workyis done
the work of the girl begins. The car
penter left the clock in Its natural
state; all light colored, plain hard
wood, ready for the talented hand of
the decorator.
And the grandmother of fifty years
hence does bold a talented hand. With
plenty of energy and lots of stain she
goes to work. She stains and she stains
and her hands bear witness that she
has done it In no tlml4 manner. She
puts the stain on thinly! and frowns be
cause It sinks in darkly- Then sbjÂ» ap
plies another coat and it sticks better;
ft third Is better still.
There is a distinct knack in staining
and varnishing and the woman who
wants to stain and finish her clock well
will begin upon the bac.Â«c Before she
has completed it she wJU have learned
a lesson or two which will come In han
dy when she tackles the front.
There are certain works of art which
tell their age and their maker by the
very looks. There are pieces of furni
ture which distinctly say to those who
understand furniture, "That piece was
made In 1830," and others will show,
at a glance, the seventeenth century
handiwork.
And bo It should be with this clock.
The style in heavy tall clocks this year
calls for a clock whicj^ls so substan
tial that It takes the combined ptrength
of all the men of the family to move It,
with the woman of the? family hard by,
bossing the Job. f ~ -
The face of the dock* like the face of
a woman, should be Jhe main thing.
It should be very pleaiing In Its shape
and its features shoul/1 be marked by
distinctness and a certain elegance or
regularity "Nothing irregular in its
markings, Just plain and ; pretty, ele
gant and always fit to be seen.
There are some big clocks whose faces
always need cleaning. They must be
polished often and " rubbed with ' this
kind of powder and that kind of paste.
such a substantial way as in the
grandmother's clock of 1950.
A pretty gift is the silk petticoat box
for the friend who Is the owner of half
a dozen silk petlcoats. -
But the Question of keeping them is
the one that bothers a woman. How is
Bhe going to preserve her petticoats?
A bureau drawer will not hold them.
Then, after that, they are crushed
down, mussed and made to look worn
before they are ever put on. Then, too,
a bureau drawer is so Inconvenient for
the purposeâ not long enough and too
wide.
The way out of it is the scented box.
And It can be an ordinary paper box,
if you have no other, padded Inside and
filled with nice scents. The outside can
be covered with cretonne and you have
a box which comes In very well for
holding your skirts.
But the best box is the Japanese box.
This is made out of thin wood, not
heavy, yet stout enough to answer as
a seat if you so desire, or It can do duty
in the corner of the room, or can stand
In a clothes press unobtrusively.
This box should be made of wood
with a Blight odor to it. Odorous woods
drive away Insects and prevent moths
from entering. If the box has no scent
then put some scent, in to it.
Scenting wood Is not difficult. You
take a little Chinese Incense, of the sort
which comes in long "pipe-like pieces,
and you light a bunch and place it in
the box. The smoke will permeate
every crack and your box will be per
manently scented. Don't be afraid of
getting it too strong, for natural woods
are highly scented if you get the sweet
kind. .
Do not think, when scenting your
box, that you must use v camphor if yon
would drive away moths. Moths do not
like odors of any kind and will fly
away from Chinese Incense as quickly
as they will from camphor gum; and
they will not enter If there Is as much
as a' whiff of rose anywhere about.
The Scented Box.
Â¦ .Women' who like highly scented gar
ments are In the habit of buying half
an ounce of oil of rose geranium. This
they use for polishing the. Inside of the
shirt waist box, which also makes an
excellent Christmas gift. A little of the
oil is dropped upon flannel , and . the in
side is thoroughly polished from one
â¢nd to the other. _JThe remainder of
the oil Is poured into the cracks.
Now, 1 comes the laying of a padded
piece In the bottom. It should be naif
On the face of the screen ana wCl
work still stranger miracles. Tho hlnga
she will remove and will replace It with
one that looks as though It might have
held a barn door. It will be very largo,
very brassy and will look the better the
older It is.
As to the framework, that is easily
fixed, with a few I â -* crnaments put
on as though they belonged on. not aa
though they were put there to keep tha
screen from actually falling apart.
And. then, the Nouveau Art girl wlH
do the proudest work of all. She will
get out a long embroidery needle with
a long golden thread With this lone
needle and the golden thread she will
work an animal, a great sprawling
thing with wings and legs, for aa tha
world like the. winged and legged an
imals which you see every day.
A girl took an old family screen tha
other day, a screen that had done- duty
In the house for ever so long, and niada
It Into a family Christmas present.
Bhe took It off with her, up to the at
tic and kept it there two weeks. Many
were the excursions she made up
there, sometimes carrying a pot ex
paint, sometimes a little varnish, some
times a brass hinge and a hammer and
sometimes a stick of wood for Its lower
legs, though short, were very dislo
cated.
Sometime* when she went no tha at
tic stairs she looked like a rainbow, for
her shoulders were covered with threads
of all kinds, blue and red and yellow,
with gold threads hanging from all.
like the gold at the end ot the rainbow.
But at last all was -finished. And then
came the removal to the. parlor and tha
afternoon tea to Introduce tha Bcreaa
to family society.
"What may it be?" asked some enÂ«
looking at the animal upon the front.
"It la a bird." said she, "a New Art
bird, one of those that look all goldy
In the sun."
Well, the screen was ft success and
the father of the girl has asked that
she give It to him for Christmas as a
surprise. He likes to be surprised with
things that are in the house rather
than with things that are yet to ba
bought! "It Is so easily settled," say a
he, "with no uncertainty."
The New Art girl. If left alona. wm
do some nice things la the Una of fam
ily decoration. True, she may make a
few mistakes, but what artist does not
make mistakes? You remember that
Madonna with the puffy eyes, do you
not? And everybody knows that tha
artist broke off those marble arms of
the Venus de Mllo because he could not
make arms good enough for the world
to see. "Don't tell on me," he whis
pered Into the marble ears and Venus,
with the warm heart, has never told a'
word.
So In making Christmas presents of
home-made furniture remember that
the defects do not show to friendly
eyes and that the small mistakes will
be visible to no one but you.
AUGUSTA PRE3COTT.
an Inch thick and should be absolutely
filled with scents of. all kinds, with a
preference for the neutral herbs, which
are never nauseating and which en
dure longer than the artificial scents.
Powdered cloves make a nice fixative
for other scents.
The object in having the pad very
thick la to afford a soft bed for the
silk waists and for the lace waists, the
waists of panne and crepe, of chiffon
and of mull. It Is coming winter and
In the -winter time all waists are nice
and waists of all kinds are worn for
evening.
The other paraphernalia of the box
are soft pads of white tissue paper
about the size and shape of your arm.
Also some bust pads of tissue. These
are for slipping Into the waists to keep
them from crushing and to keep the
Bilk from cracking.
There are ever so many ways of fin
ishing the outside of the box. A nice
way calls for thin Japanese matting,
which la tacked on the outside and
neatly finished with strips of spilt
bamboo. Or the matting can be fin
ished with bands of tape. Ribbon also
makes a good binding, or a row of gold
tacks.
If you desire you can take and work
the matting before putting It on the
outside of the box and you can do a
nice pattern upon it In colored crewels.
Done In this manner It makes a very
nice Christmas gift.
There are those who can paint In
Japanese fashion, which Is in large,
flowery designs, and. If you can do this,
the decoration of the box Is simple.
Lovely designs can be put on without
difficulty and with the expenditure of
very little time.
The shirt-waist box can be utilised
for dress skirts, but in this case the
box must be a little longer and must be
kept strictly for dress skirts. It should
be long and narrow and supplied with
.separate pads to lay between the sepa
rate skirts.
Shirt-waist suits can be kept In these
boxes and. Indeed, almost everything
a woman wears from the rising of the
sun until the going down of the sameâ
and a little later.
The New Art GirL
And here Is another pretty gift.
Is there an old screen In thÂ© house,
an Impossible thing, with a dark back
ground,, a rickety frame, a creaky
hinge and a weak back?
Give It to the Nouveau Art girl and
she will do wonders with It. She will
strengthen the back with heavy brown
wrapping paper, the sort that grocers
used to use, with little specks In It that
looked good enough to eat.
She will take this paper and paper
the back and then, with facile brush,
she will place streaks of gold and red
paint an over It. She will put them on
In queer ways so that the back of the
screen looks as If It were out In a
golden snowstorm. And In the middle
she will paint a girl's figure.
The Nouveau Art girl runs to wom
en and animals and roses, the three
lovely things of earth.

TO tne economical but unbltJoti*
hostess the Christmas dinner is
always a problem. What shall
she serve and how shall it be
cooked? and what will it cost? These
ire questions that she finds arc not
readily answered. The traditional
menu that usually finds its way into
print is invariably too elaborate, too
expensive andâ indigestible. Besides,
[t means cooking for too many peo
ple. What the modern housewife
really desires is a menu to please a
small party of, say, not more than
sight, and it is to supply this want
that The Sunday Call has secured
from Bab, the famous caterer, not
only one of his most highly prized
aienus, but the recipes for each and
;very article, from the beginning to
the end, of the dinner, 60 that it can
be easily and correctly prepared and
served.

strain into a fancy cocktail glass,
squeeze a piece of lemon peel on top

OYSTERS.
Oysters should be kept in a very cool
place before they are opened and well
washed before using, ; otherwise their
appearance will be destroyed. They
should, according to the French custom,
be opened on the deep shell, so as to
better preserve the liquor, then laid on
finely chopped ice for a short time â too
long destroys their flavor. While they
should be kept as cold as possible, they
should never be allowed to freeze,
therefore they should only be opened
shortly before needed, for once frozen
they quickly turn sour.
" The proper way to open them Is to
place the deep shell in the palm of the
left hand and break them on one Bide.
The Boston stabbing: knife Is prefer
able for this, but if there be none handy
use a small block that the oyster can
fit into and stab it on the edge; or even
a chopplng-block and chopplng-knlfe
may be employed in case of necessity.
Serve six oysters for each person, nie^
ly arranged on oyster-plates with quar
ters of lemons.

A pretty notion and one that always
pleases 1b made of celery stumps. Just
the plain, gnarled roots and the rougher
and more fantastical in shape they are
the better. Each one seems bent on
going its own way In life and after it
has been thoroughly scrubbed,' the very
center is hollowed out and a piece cut
off the &o?tom so It win stand upright.
Then it Is filled with stuffed olives and
as a last effort to make it' proud of it
self a piece'' of c celery .'.or parsley Is
placed In '] the center, of i it . and to all
Intents and purposes Its main Idea
seems. to be to shade the olives. Such
ideas are always unique and it makes
no difference ; how ' much trouble they
may have been, If an amused .ripple
goes around the table you cannot but
feel well repaid.'
It really Isn't such a gigantic task
after all If you go about it in a system
atic'fashion, and, Mrs. Hostess,: if you
are a clever lady you will have a little
heart to heart with your cook and maid
the day before, the gala occasion, for in
this way you . will be able to throw off
much. of your responsibility,; which in
itself will allow you to devote yourself
entirely to enjoying the festivities as
much as any of your guests.
"Right you are. Sir James," replied
Croft, as the ghost of a smile stole ovar
his face and he winked at himself.

"Ton have several artificial plants In
tubs, your honor, and this one In par
ticular Is so light that even a woman
could lift it. Will you please have it
out?"
Sir James looked at tha agent In a
puzzled way, but seized the plant and
lifted it from the tub. and then held up
Ills hands in amazement. At the bot
tom of the tub was the missing jewel
box with tha contents intact,
"You see," said Croft, "In three or,
four days more the box would have
gone home with one of your guests."
"Croft," said Sir James, as he laid
his hand on' the man's shoulder, "you
must know the thief."
"I do, Sir James."
"But don't tell me his name, 1*11 send
him off with Â£50 In his pocket and not

Immortelles.
The manufacture of Immortelle
wreaths in Pari3 occupies at least 1500
persons. The immortelles are gather
ed about the beginning of October, and
come chiefly from the arid hills in the
middle and south of France. They are
brought to the markets in their natural
condition, and the yellow blossoms are
dyed green, red and white, and woven
into wreath.3 by , special workmen In
readiness for All Saints' and All Souls'
days, when all good Parisians visit
their relatives' graves. .On these "fetes
des morts" the gates of the cemeteries
are beset with crowds of dealers in Im
mortelle wreaths, wire crosses and
bead crowns. At Pere la Chaise alone
more than 200.000 persons are calcu
lated to visit the cemetery, and the sale
of immortelle wreaths varies from 20,
000 to 25,000â Golden Penny.
"I'll bank on my own servants, but
you watch the gentlemen's valets and
the ladles' maids â particularly Lady
Sparrow's maid. That's all."
- Among the guests was Mrs. Major
Blank, whose husband was in the Four
teenth. She was handsome, petite and
versatile and was generally spoken of
as little Mrs. Blank. In a way, she was
not in the aristocratic setâin a money
way. In another, way she was popular,
and it was the thing to invite
her. Every hostess found her a valua
ble coadjutor In entertaining, and if the
major never showed up and she flirted
a bit with other men, there was no one
to speak ill of her. ..She was so mildly
wicked, if wicked at all, that It didn't
count. Of the twenty-two guests on
"Lady Sparrow, 'for instance, will
be sure to bring her Â£15.000 worth of
diamonds and wear them every evening
at . dinner. She's proverbially careless
of her Jewels.."
"Not a doubt of it."
"I think the rest may look out for
themselves, but you must act as a
guardian In a way for Lady Sparrow.
You will be assistant butler for the
time being."
"At your service. Sir James."
to open on a certain year 8Ir James
wrote to Abraham Croft to pay him a
business visit. It. was not Croft's first.
As a private inquiry agent he had been
made use of on various occasions, and
he was known to be up In his profes
sion.
"I shall have ten gentlemen and
twelve ladles in ray house for two
weeks, beginning on the 3d," said Sir
James, as he sat In the library with
Croft. "Here is the list."
"Good, people," commented Croft, as
he glanced at the names.
"None better; but I don't want any
thing to happen.". >~ . < :

shapes here and there and a number
of Btuffed olives to lend their touch of
most comrortable feeling In the wort*,
but after all the skewers and strings
that have been used In trussing have
been removed, it Is not a task that
should send a man forth hungry.
See that it is placed with its breast
to the left of the carver so that h<Â»
may insert his fork firmly in the small
end of the breast-bone as he holds It
in position that way until the process
is quite over.
Next cut off the wings and legs, as
they are always somewhat In the way,
by beginning on the farther side and
cutting through the Joints next the
body.
That much is to the good. But before
anything more is done hs should re
move them to the serving platter, In
order to make more room for himself,
and then he begins on the breast, al

That really is the secret of earring
a turkey, and while it sounds simple
it requires a skilled hand to accomplish
it Just so. Epicures solemnly declare
that the two muscles that are to be
found on each side of the back near the
legs and the bits that are found in the
cavities of the neck are the sweetest
and most tempting of the entire bird,
but unless the carver Is up to snuff he
nearly always overlooks these morsels
or Is afraid to wander into unexplored
regions. ,
If one of your own family is to do the
carving it is possible to take him Into
the kitchen and put him through a rig
orous bit of training on the side and
to seat your guests so that another
one 'of the family may be near enough
to help in decorating the individual
plates.
The bird itself may be festooned with
preens and berries. and even tied with
grass streamers, but it should be dis
tinctly remembered that it is there to
eat and not merely to look at and that
all the frills and furbelows make it
harder for the carver to handle the bird
neatly.
And carving, by the way. Is an ac
complishment that no one need sneeze
at. Few people, even the heads of
households, can always find the Joints,
and tvhen there are many mouths to fill
it pays to understand Mr. Bird thor
oughly, for he will serve Just twice as
many plates when properly served.
It's no uncommon thing to hear a
man eay, "I'd rather go without my
dinner than carve and It's all because
he firmly expects the turkey to fly
from the platter into the lap of his
nearest neighbor and to deluge the next

The little patty shells should be well
heated and by way cf a contrasting
color parsley leaves and thin slices of
lemon may be added and the whole
makes as appetizing a dish as can be
imagined.
A Christmas dinner Isn't a Christmas
dinner without a turkey and to make it
seem all the more so It should be carved
at the table.
If you are looking for effects you can
order the bird stuffed Just so and have
him brought on sitting up and survey
ing things generally. Then In a twink

In the center of the table place a
reindeer and hitch numerous little sou
venirs, such es animals filled with
candy, musical Instruments with glace
fruits and automobiles with nuts in
ruch a position that the guests may
help themselves when they feel so in
clined, and in this way the toys serve
three purposes, for they make appro
priate favoqi to be taken home as a
reminder of a Jolly evening. There are
as many wee stockings on the tree as
there are guests and each one is tied
with a gay ribbon that is fastened di
rectly in front of the place plate of the
person It is intended for. When all are
6eated. first one and then another
should follow up the ribbon and find
out what Santa Claus has left for them
and in this v.-ay no end of merriment
is created. If time is no object the
fame Idea may be carried out In an
other way. Instead of running the rib
bons to the plates they may be inter
laced ttrre and time again and tied
J^jst where the ribbon gives out. In
this tray it is impossible to seat the
puests, es first one and then another
is winding and unwinding and the
stocking belongs, not to the person that
it chances to be In front of, but the
one whose ribbon is attached to it.
Oysters are a good starter Tor the
dinner and as they are always on the
shell on ice they afford a splendid op
portunity for fancy frills of holly. Take
the berries stripped from the branches
and dot them thickly in an Icy bed
and efter they have been frozen the
sudden heat of the dining-room will
cover them with sparkling beads and
they will glimmer like so many crystal
lized drops.
The miniature tree may be of ever
green or an imitation for that matter,
but the fragrant pine adds so much
that It Is a Ehame not to use it when
It is possible.
True hospitality does not necessarily
mean that one must have the finest or
the best in the land, but It most cer
tainly docs mean that the spirit of the
time must be freely given, and with
that all things are possible, for a little
care and a little thought will see the
"whole thing through and in a truly
charming manner at that.
The hostess who is priving a dinner
feels that she has undertaken no small
task, and, of a truth, these days of
elaborate decorations means a display
of Ingenuity that must be eternally and
forever on the qui vive.
It doesn't seem to make much differ
ence how old the tree idea or how child-
Ith It may eeem. the fact still remains
that staid business men and gentle
faced women delight In it and It Is one
of the very prettiest ways to decorate
the Christmas table.

Ply Isn't any such word. There isn't
any single day of the whole year that
is as exhilarating or as fascinating as
Christmas day, even if It does tax the
merry hostess to the utmost, for unless
she Is in half a dozen places at one
and the same time trouble Is more than
likely to brew at a fast and furious
rate.
But whatever else you do. don't prate
on the "afford" proposition. Unless you
feel that hospitality is a privilege and a
pleasure Instead of a tiresome burden.
It would be a heap better for you to
dispense entirely with any form of en
tertainment and Bit seirnely and quiet
ly In the seclusion of your own home
and in the privacy of your own family.
They at least will understand your
cry that is so out or place at this time
of the year and they may on a pinch
sympathize with you. but they are Just
about the only people on the face of
the prreat green globe that will.
"Bound to be picked up sooner or lat
er," mused Croft, "and I shall keep an
eye on the maid. She seems demure, but
I believe she knows a thing or two."
On the twelfth day of her stay Lady
Sparrow got out her diamonds at mid
afternoon and saw her maid brush
them up a bit. They were then left
lying In their box on the table while the
owner lay down for a nap before din
ner. When she awoke the box was
gone.
"Queer case," said Croft to Sir James
three hours later. "I laid It to the maid
at first, but found that she can prove
a perfect alibi. She wasn't even In the
house at the time the box was taken
nor can I find that any servant was
within fifty feet of Lady Sparrow's
room. No one could have entered by
her windows, and of course the thief
Is Inside the house. We are going to
have trouble to locate him or her, how
ever. I've questioned every servant,
and I can't Bay that I suspect any of
them."
"But you can't suspect any of the
guests!" exclaimed Sir James in con
sternation.
"Not In the slightest It's a mm go.
and I've got my work cut out for me."
Two days later he had still nothing to
report. The servants had been ques
tioned and cross-questioned, and valets
and maids had been given the "third
degree," and at length Croft was satis
fied of the Innocence of all the under
lings.
"Then It was some slick thief who got
In despite your vigilance," reproach
fully observed Sir James.
"I should rather say it was one of
your twenty-two guests," doggedly re
plied the agent.
"But think of It. man."
"Aye, I'm thinking. Sir James.**
"Who among them can you possibly
suspect? Why, sir. It's simply mon
strous. 1 I'd sooner pay for the jewels
twice over than to hint that one of my
guests Is under' suspicion. No. no.
Croft. It's a queer case, and the thief
was too much for you, and I'll pay the
loss and hush up the talk."
"But I want to remain here for a
week or ten days," said the asent. "1
confess to being puzzled now, but my
reputation Is at stake, and I mu3t try
and solve the mystery."
He was told to remain and do h!s
best, and that night as he lay In his
bed he whispered in his own ears:
"It's dollars to cents that the Jewels
were taken by a guest. Now, who
would be the soonest suspected, and
who the last? Let's say that Lady Spar
row stole her own diamonds, she being
a seeker after notoriety. That charge
won't hold, however, as she turned
her whole baggage out for inspection,
and her fainting away when she dis
covered her loss was the genuine thing.
Now, who Is last? Why, little Mrs.
Blank, of course. I'll stake all on her
Innocence, but I'm going to watch her.
Her room is five doors away, and she
gays she was out on the lawn from four
to five on the afternoon of the robbery,
but let us see what can be turned up."
Detective Croft did something in do-
Ing nothing. He wouldn't tell, Sir
James nor anr of the guests his
thoughts", and to have tried to watch
the little woman as she flitted about
would have been ridiculous. He there
fore passed most of his time in the con
servatory wondering where he could
take hold of the case. On his first day
he saw little Mrs. Blank enter the place
twice and wander about and sing to
herself. On the second day she was In
and out three times. On the third day
she slyly took from her pocket a letter
which she read with considerable agi
tation and, woman-like, dropped It on
the floor as she went out. She returned
for It in five minutes, but Croft had
posseMSt-d himself of the contents.
"Well?" briskly demanded Sir James,
as the agent asked for an interview
that evening.
"I think I have found the Jewels,"
was the reply.
"You think: but don't you know?"
"Not exactly. I have saved the
pleasure for you. Let us go Into the
conservatory and lock the door."
"Well?" again queried Sir James In
the list, she was the least known to
Croft, and he was, therefore, prepared
to watch her the closest. He had no
sooner got sight of her. however, than
he whispered to himself:
"I am way off there. She's got the
Innocence of a baby, and it would be
time thrown away to watch her."
Lady Sparrow brought her diamonds
and she brought a new maid, and she
sustained her reputation for careless
ness. Sometimes Sir James coaxed her
Into Jetting him lock up the Jewels for
the night, but they were oftener left
to the care of the maid or to no care at
all.

or, two of them packing, with Â£20 notes

you are rushed, for time oWt run
away with the Idea that a corset cover
or chemise la the easiest thing on earlh
to fashion.
They ! are so dainty and sheer. Col
ored corset covers are more of , : a fad
than anything else and are only worn
under a thin frock, but the other
pieces are always made of. white linen
or of a soft dimity. - l --â.'-Â¦
they are improved. .
Then If you want to make them espe
cially attractive, mark the sot with an
initial and either work it in solid or
merely outline it, but either way the
result Is good and the extra time spent
is seldom considered wasted.
Doylies are always pretty and ac
ceptable and the girl who take* pride
in a dainty room never can get enough
to entirely fill her wants. She places
them under a wee vase that contains a
single flower, under a silver tray or a
bit of brass, but always to t*he best
advantage and where they make the
best showing.
So here Is where the home body Is
able to make another inning. Every
time she finds a piece of stray huck
that has been left over from roller
towels she st/alghtway appropriates it
and in an Idle moment puts a circular
border around it and later embroiders
it to suit her fancy. .
The entire piece Is laid on a flat sur
face' and a round ring placed about It
and marked off, so that when the fanoy
stitches are finished all that remains to
be done Is to ravel out the huck and
cut the fringe '. the proper, shape.
Pretty lingerie is always an accepta
ble gift, especially when it is made
every stitch by hand. While the good
old days of hand work have almost en
tirely passed away, It makes the few
pieces the more sought after, but â¢ If
There la hardly any grveix role about
the : number of yards of material, for
they vary according : to the way It Is
made, but when the ribbon Is about an
Inch In width and the Insertion : about

whole.

monograms and raised work In the
corners and about the border; In fact,
the more^the prettier and the more
elaborate the cover.

sertion Is added, it takes but two falr
sised ones, but when the linen is used
by itself and they are made plenty full
It takes three. The shoulder strap*
depend entirely upon the whim of the
maker. A piece of insertion bound with
lace on two sides Is fluffy and pretty,
and it washes well, but ribbon adds a
!dash of color and is Infinitely less work
to put on the first time, and the maker,
as a rule, troubles her head but little
about the numerous times the ribbon
will have to be ripped off and sewed on
again when It goes to the laundry.
For the girl that does a good deal of
needlework there Is the handy apron.
Not the regulation white affair that is
used to protect the gown from threads
and the like, but a useful ttttle thing
that is Intended to look dashing and
yet be useful at the same time.
It is made of any material that Is
soft and : pretty, but those made of a
flowered dimity are more attractive
than a white wash silk one, for the rose

Feather stitching in a contrasting
color Is a pretty and quick way to fin
ish them Instead of the plain machine
Etitching and when they are picked up
now and then in the evenings and
worked on for only a few minutes It Is
astonishing how rapidly they make a
showing for themselves and how much
Glass toweling is about as good a ma
terial as it is possible to find, for it
washes time after time and is never
the worse for wear. It need not neces
sarily be plain or have an ugly red bor
der about It, for these days It comes in
blue and white checks or 'in the red
and white, and there is enough variety
in the sizes to suit even the most fas
tidious.
The best and easiest way to do Is to
measure your own shoes and use them
as a guide. Remember that the ma
terial must be doubled to resemble a
bag or else the boots would drop out.
Fold the material over twice and then
count on about a third of the length for
a flap that buttons and holds them se
curely in place. Generally the flap is
about five or six inches long and may
be square or pointed to suit the fancy
of the maker.
That makes a suitable bag, so It
should be stitched down the very cen
ter, dividing It into two equal parts.
Even after each shoe is buttoned In its
own little house, the effect Is not good
and they take up altogether too much
room, so a piece of tape is sewed firmly
on the middle of the ba.g and when It
Is tied the boots are ready to be stowed
away next the best Bilk gown In the
trunk.
it together. Fold it three times and run
two bands of narrow ribbon about the
outside, taking care to see that the enda
are plenty long enough to tie, for then
it may be made into a small, neat pack
et and will not be a troublesome nui
sance.
If you want to finish it up to a T^
stock it with pins of all kinds and sizes
and descriptions. Not until you have
visited some pin counter and thorough
ly investigated the supply will you re
alize the variety and usefulness of them.
There are wee ones that look like so
many small pearls, tiny Uts of coral
mounted on a short brass pin, small
Jet imitations and such a countless va
riety that It would take Just about half
a minute to fill the case and do it well.
Only a woman appreciates and un
derstands the values of pins and when
she can lay her hand on half a dozen
kinds when she is dressing in a hurry
Bhe counts herself thrice blessed. To,
the casual observer the useful article
might seem more of a nuisance than^
anything else, but it is the kind of a
one that is carried about from pillar to
post and is duplicated year after year.-
Another homely convenience is the
Bhoe bag. Not the one that hangs on
the closet door and that serves as a
sort of free grab-bag, but the one that
is used exclusively in trunks and that
saves all the fuss and feather of hunt
ing about the house for a piece of
newspaper to wrap muddy rubbers and
boots In.
One of the most convenient trifles for
the girl who travels is a pin scrap.
Not the plain, ordinary pin cushion
that is a catchall for everything, but
Instead a dainty little affair that may
be tucked away into a corner of the
trunk or pinned on the bureau where
it may be easily gotten at.
And one of the beauties about it is
the trifling cost. There in scarcely a
house that does not contain a scrap
bag and there is scarcely a scrap bag
that does not contain a piece of eider
down twelve inches square. For that is
the main part of it. There is, of course,
an outside ribbon, but as it may be
any color, there generally is not much
difficulty in finding that part of it. Silk
or satin will do quite as well for that
matter, and while it Is prettiest when
made of a baby blue or a rosy pink
it is not half as serviceable and after
a few months will look as though it
had come out of the ark itself.
The making is so simple that any
child could put It together without the
slightest difficulty.
An interlining of cheese cloth and
sprinkled lavishly with sachet powder
Is nice, but it is not necessary and
runs the expense up quite a little. But
either with or without It the making
la quite the same. The silk is turned
In all around the four corners, and so
la the eiderdown, but the finishing
touches are quite different. The outer
cover is firmly caught down with a
feather stitch, that try as hard as you
may, will ehow through a little on the
opposite side. Then to overcome that
part of it, ribbon the color of the elder
down and about a half Inch in width
Is put on in a blind fashion and the
pretty bauble Is nearly completed.
That leaves it perfectly square, or
oblong if you have chanced to make It
that shape, and there is nothing to hold
If you have even the smallest amount
of ingenuity you may make a success
of it, and while the drawing may seem
like a small mountain, it can be traced
on in a moment and readily redrawn
with ink. In almost any shop the fan
may be purchased for half a dollar, for
It Is the plainest of the plain, in fact,
the stlffer and whiter the better for the
work stands out in sharp contrast.
The one expense consists of a cord
and tassel, for it may or may not come
with the fan, but, at most, it costs a
paltry sum and is always well worth
the amount, for it dresses the pretty
trinket up not a little.
HCBT how to make tins best ap
1 pearanoe for the least money Is
\ the all besetting question about
QJ two weeks before the 25th day of
December, and If you have solved the
proposition of making $20 take the
place of $40, you are about one of the
luckiest individuals on the face of the
earth.
It really isn't so awfully difficult after
all If you only possess the mystic com
bination. The article that costs $7 50
in a shop may be fashioned every bit
as well at home for one-third the
sum, and who is to knpifc' or care, for
that matter, the exact money value?
One of the prettiest home gifts is a
fan. Not the wee spangled affair that
is so much used in the evenings, but
a fair sized white one decorated with
pen and ink sketches that may be
placed on the wall instead of a pic
ture.
Slender girl Is to take the laoe and
ribbon and sew them, strip for' strip,
in a long piece and then send It to be
accordion pleated. Then practically
nothing remains to do but belt it with
a bit of beading, both top and bottom,
and sew ribbons on that which are to
serve as shoulder straps. It's the sim
plest sort of a cover, but is one of the
fluffiest that can be imagined. It re
quires no fitting and Is perfectly
straight, excepting a slight hollow
under the arm. so that it will not bulge
and eel uncomfortable, but otherwise
it is "plain sewing.
Then, on the other hand, the ribbon
and lace may be run the other way and
the result is quite as good. Long

It is but a trifle, that costs exactly
Â¦what you want it to. for the actual ex
pense depends entirely upon the qual
ity of the material used. There are
eome delicate ginghams that may be
bought anywhere from 20 to 63 or 7Â«
cents a yard, but they are not as flimsy
looking and consequently , never look
quite as much a dress-up affair as the
organdy or the lawn ones.
A pretty way of telling your frleadf
what the apron is intended for lÂ» to
put a few spools of thread in on*

other and line the third with odds and
ends of silks, needles and a thimble.
That finishes it off to a nicety and
makes of it a much more elaborate gift,
yet at the same time it costs consider*
ably more, which generally has a great
deal to do with it about tho holiday
season.
One of the best ways to get around
the money problem is to put away any
small amount, no matter how trifling
it may be â say only 25 cents a weekâ
but put it away systematically, even IX

surprising how quickly it will grow and

Remnant hunting isn4 a half -bad
scheme either, especially in summer
fabrics, for the larger stores are all la
tent on clearing them out in order to
make room for the spring styles, and
there are abundant opportunities of
picking up two or three yards of lawn
for a mere song, and when aprons are
to be made every little thing count*
not a little.
And It is the lama at the ribbon
counter. There are hosts of chances
to pick up a yard or so left over, and
the first thing you know the gift Is
ready to tie up in tissue paper, and the
total cost has been but a few pennies.

and never the right one at the right
time. *
The latest In the simple ones are
made of gentlemen's handkerchief* and
they are not only pretty but are very
serviceable as well, which counts for a
great deal these days. Buy a 'kerchief
that has a border of some color, for In
stance a bright red or a pink, and by
a little maneuvering you will find that
the middle part can be cut out and that
there are exactly four small seams to
be sewed up and tha tie is complete.
It takes at the longest probably three
quarters of an hour to make, and a*

Handkerchiefs themselves are a use

are so trying on the eyes and that show
every time they are taken out that
they are something out of the ordinary.
The linen may be had at any shop for

looks better if It Is about a half Inch
wide and never should be more than
three-quarters. The corners are trying
affairs, but the neatness of the hand
kerchief depends upon it.
About the best way Is to cut them
out a little and then turn the edges to

In that way many washings will not

CHRISTMAS PRESENTS MADE FROM ODDS AND ENDS
22of the persons .whom the windows
commemorated. Howard - triumphantly
queried why, then, should the legend,
"Sacred to; the memory of Walter, be
loved husband of Mary Bird r Ferris, ''
appear .' under 'a ' tall ' woman in dark
green glass Â» with a moat Â¦ feminine
amount Â¦ of hair and : a long > red sash?
Edgar was staggered, but suddenly re
called his father's glowing account of
a costume ball given by the Knights of
Pythias, In which many of the knights
appeared in women's; clothes,, one in
particular, /the proprietor,' of a fish
market, having rented a long and flow
ing wig the better to deceive his fellow
knights i: and-, their, -delighted' guests.
This had Impressed Edgar as intensely
humorous ; he greatly enjoyed pictur
ing the scene to his Imagination, and
he strengthened his wavering infalli
bility by, declaring that . .the ; Â¦, beloved
husband of Mary Â¦ Bird : Ferris wa3 be
yond doubt a " Pythian in â¢ costume.
This had silenced" Howard for a week,
but one afternoon at evensong, just be
fore the . electric bell sounded in the
robing room Â¦ to . summon them to the
hall, he had rapidly inquired in a hiss
ing whisper "Who that white puppy
carryin' the flag In the round /window
on the side, where the bird was, was a
picture of?"
': ' The ; bird was the lectern Â¦ eagle, and
neither of Â¦ the antagonists had ever
seen a lamb. â¢ Edgar had recognized the
fact that It .was a poorly drawn puppy,"
and I he . did not believe that It could
possibly have balanced on one crooked
up knee and at that perilous angle any
such-banner as the artist had given it.
It' was also crushlngly apparent to him
that no Knight of Pythias, with all the
assistance in the , world, could trans
form himself into such a woolly, curly,
four-legged object as that. ;
.Then _why. should the. brass plate be

Y OTJ all know how they look In tha
/ I pictures; they have appealing
violet eyes and drooping mouths
and oval faces. They tip their
heads back and to tha Bide and
there is usually a broad beam of light
falling across their little official
nighties.
But Edgar was not that kind. So
greatly did he differ, in fact, that even
tha choirmaster was deceived and dis
covered him with difficulty. When the
gentleman confronted them In the par
ish house a mob of suspicious littlo
boys, Bhoving, growling, snickering and
otherwise fulfilling their natures, he
promptly selected Tim Mulialy, who
possessed to an amazing degree the
violet eyes and the drooping mouth and
the oval Iface, as his first soprano.
But Tim refused to sing the scale
alone, and as the others scorned ac
companying him in this exercise Mr.
Fellows, determinedly patient, suggest
ed in the hilarious "come-on-boys!"
fashion consecrated to childhood by
adults that they should all Join in some
popular melody to limber them up and
dispel their uneasiness.
"What shall we sing?" he called out
breezily from the piano stool, faintly
indicating a "ragtime" rhythm with his
left hand.
" 'Hot time!' " burst from one of the
youngsters.
"All right!" and the Inviting melody
drew them In; soon they were shouting
lustily. Raucous altos, nasal sopranos,
fatal attempts to compass a bass â at
any rate, they were started. The verse
was over, the chorus had begun, when
a sudden sound sent the choirmaster's
heart to his throat, his hands left the
keys. Into the medley of coarse boyish
shouting dropped a silvery thread of
purest song, a very bird note. For a
moment it flowed on the level of the
chorus, then suddenly, with an Inde
scribable leap, a slurring rush. It rose
to an octave above and led them alL
The choirmaster twirled around on the
stool.
"Who's that? Which boy Is singing
up there?" he demanded excitedly.
There was no reply. They grinned con
sciously at each other; one could im
agine them all guilty.
"Come, come, boys! Don't be sillyâ
who was it?"
Silence of the most sepulchral sort.
Mr. Fellows shrugged his shoulders,
swung round again and started the sec
ond verse. They dashed through it
noisily; he picked out here and there
a eweet little treble, one real alto. But
his ears were pricked for something
better, and presently it came. The
rhythm was too enticing:
Please, oh, please, oh, don't you let me fallâ
"By George, he's a human blackbird!"
Tou're til mine, an' I love you bert of allâ
"That's high C!"
An* you tnus' be my man, 'r I'll havt no man
at allâ
The choirmaster burst Into a Joyous
if somewhat reedy tenor.
There'll be a hot time In the old town to-night!
He whirled about, still singing, and
caught the ecstatic, dreamy gaze of
Tim Mulialy.
"It's you!" he cried, pouncing on
â¢ him. Tim giggled feebly.
â¢"Yes, sir," he said.
"Now sing this scale and I'll give you
five cents."
An envious sigh quavered through the
parish halL
Tim threw back his head and opened
his drooping mouth.
"Do. re â "
There was a flash of blue gingham,
a snarl of rage, a sound as of fifty
pounds of small boy suddenly seated
on the floor.
"Where's yer fi' cents?" a new voice
inquired easily.
The choirmaster perceived with
amazement that the owner of the
voice, a freckled boy with an exceed
ingly retrousse nose, was sitting on
the prostrate Tim.
"What's the meaning of this? Get
up!" he said sternly. your
name? I can't have any of this sort
of thing In my choir!"
The freckled boy did not rise. In
fact, he seated "himself more comfort
ably on Master Mulialy and demand
ed c^jxin:
"Where's yer ft' cents?"
The choirmaster stepped forward
and seized the offender's collar. As
his fingers tightened the captive burst
into the chorus of the moment before
it was the blackbird's voice! So ob
stinate was the choirmaster's first im
pression that he looked instinctively
at the fallen Tim to catch the notes,
but Tim was struggling meekly but
firmly for breath, and this free trill
ing came from above him. The choir
master relaxed his hold.
"It was you all the time!" he said In
a stupor of surprise.
"I dunno. . I guess so. I didn't ask
him that. I Just says to him, "Aw, say,
Mr. Fellows, arn't us boys goin' camp-
In* ?' An" ha says, 'I guess not this yÂ«ar,
Tim, mos' prob'ly. Maybe a plcnle"â â
"Well, I bet 'he don't bounce ma! I

Edgar strutted before them. Thay re
garded him with interest
"Whatcher yer coin' to do?" thay
asked respectfully.
"What'll I do? I'llâ I'll bounca my

strode home.
His moody, air during supper con
vinced Mr. Ogden that something was
up. Ever since he had discovered Ed
gar's demand for an additional 10 cents
a Sunday, on the ground that his moth
er thought him worth more, and his
later daring strike for 5 cents more sal

considered abundantly Justified and
paid out of his own pocket, Mr. Ogden.
who, having heard rumors of wild dis
sipations in the peanut and root bear
line, had pounced upon his son return
ing plethoric from pay day and annexed
the extra 15 cents, was convinced of the
necessity of surveillance .for this wily
wage earner and formed the habit of
escorting him regularly on pay nights,
"alone at first, later escorted by Mrs.
Ogden, who accompanied the family
group as a .self -constituted and final
auditor.
It frequently has been remarked that
a great grief may bind together onca
disunited members of a family; It is
extremely improbable that any affliction
whatever could have produced amons
the Ogdens such a gratifying esprit da
corps as resulted from their unfeigned
interest In pay day. But when Mr. Og
den had shadowed his son to no mora
secluded and .dangerous spot than tha
churchyard and saw him in earnest
conclave 1 with his attentive mates, ha
went, relieved, about his business, re
assured by the words "campln* out"
and "Sunday afternoon" that he caught
from behind a convenient tombstone.
He was utterly unconscious that tha
scene he had left was far more men
acing to. his household than even tha
most disfiguring fight of his warllka
son's varied repertoire. But bo it was.
Haranguing, promising, taunting,
threatening, Edgar led them, finally
subdued. Into one of tha most satisfac
tory rehearsals of the year.
They waited till ID: 4 5 o'clock 'â¢a
Sunday, and finally the men marched
in alone, somewhat conscious and -ill
at- ease, followed by a red-faced, de
termined rector and a puzzled vial ting
clergyman. They san* "O Happy
Band of Pilgrims," but It was re
marked by. the wondering congrega
tion that they did not- look happy
'themselves. There was no music but
the hymns, which, as they had been
altered to well-known numbers, war*
chanted lustily by tha inhabitants of
the pews, thus winning the sincere ad
miration of tho visiting clergyman.'
"Really, such well-trained congre
gational singing Is quite rare," ha re
marked afterward to the rector, and
was somewhat surprised at tho short
answer: "It shall certainly never oc
cur agaln."t
It had gone hard with, tha vested
choir but for Mrs. Ogden. Mr. Fal
lows pleaded in vain; in vain the-
Ladles' Auxiliary passed resolutions;
the rector was firm. It was only whÂ«n
Mrs. Ogden swept in upon him in his
study, a chastened, still apprehensive
boy under ona arm, followed by half
a dozen* women similarly equipped,
and made a speech that will adorn
the* parish annals for many a year,
that he yielded, respectfully con- ,
vlnced.
Edgar had met his Waterloo, and
lived, so to speak, under a consequent
military surveillance, with much of
his. prestige gone-, his pay docks d for
a month, and tha certainty of - ap
proaching warm weather, when It
would be impossible to take cold, and
nothing but a summons to the choir
invisjbla could excuse him from re
hearsals hare, to render* the future all
too clear to him. In the words of the *
processional:
His tonrne could never tire
. Of ilnjlns with the choir.
To-day, if you should attend eren
song at St. .Mark's, you will beyond
a doubt ba delighted with a silver
voice that appears to proceed from a
violet-eyed boy with a sweet expres
sion.
"It is a good thine: to giva thanks
unto the Lord!" the voice declares
melodiously, but it is : doubtful if ita
owner Is in' a thankful frame of mind.
He would .in all probability prefer to
be with his brother Samuel, who is at
present touring the West triumphant
ly with a Methodist revivalist, ren
dering "Where is My Wandering Boy
To-Night" to weeping congratulations,
for $10 a week and hl3 traveling ex-Â»
renses. And even this success leaves
Squealer dissatisfied; he would far
rather be In his father's position â

"Old Homestead"; quartetâ and sing
"The Palms" behind the scenes when
the stereoptlcon vision of the repent
ant prodigal thrills tha audience. .
It would seem that your artistic
temperament is doomed to discontent.
Whereas Mrs. Ogden, who cannot
carry a tune, is perfectly satisfied with
fine ' laundry work.
Had they heard that they wera to be
bounced? Did they believe that the two
weeks' camping out, the object of all
their endurance and loyalty, the prize
of their high calling M .was to be dis
continued? Tim was deputed to in
quire on Saturday afternoon. He re
turned disconsolate; they shoved each
other significantly.
"What'd he say? What'd ha say?"
"He says mos' prob'ly not. Says it
costs too I much. Says maybe a pic
nic"ââ
"Aw! old chump! Goin' to bounce ua,
too?" â¢
Mr. Ogden, as we know, was on busl-
Pness of his own â business that kept him
glaring fixedly in the rector's direction,
/which encouraged that good man still
further. It Is to be doubted if the bro
therhood would have appealed to him,
however. Not that he would have been
hindered by any narrow sectarian ten
dencies. Mrs. Ogden, who did up the
shirt waists of the Presbyterian min
ister's daughter, was by her presented
regularly with a missionary bank in
- the form of a papier mache cottage,
with a chimney Imitating red- brick;
and Edgar, employing a Napoleonic
strategy, triumphantly attended the
Methodist Christmas festivals and the
Baptist Sunday school picnics, the lat
ter society, offering a merry-go-round
on a larger scale; the former providing
â¢ the infant faithful with more practi
. cable presents and larger candy bags.
Mr. Ogden felt, with a certain Justice,
that his church connections did him
credit on the whole, and excused him
self from any undue energy in that di
rection.
He watched his son keenly, but Ed
gar's ecclesiastical demeanor was with
out a flaw. Mottover. his plans were
gradually maturing. He sans amen at
proper Intervals and managed to get
between the organist and the tenor,
who depended on Mr. Fellows to mark
the /time for him with his left hand,
and in consequence of being unable to
see him. bungled his offertory eolo; but
his thoughts were otherwhere. He had
decided to slip out of the south transept
door, thus eluding parental pursuit, and
fight Howard Potter in his own back
yard before he slept. He would prac
tice upon his victim a recent scientific
acquisition proudly styled by him "the
uppercut," which he had teamed from
an acquaintance at the cost of 10 cents
. and three sugar cookies.
At this point the anthem prelude
drew him to his feet. He had saved his
voice, according to directions, for his
solo, and in the waiting hush every
word flowed, soft and pure, -to the end
of the church.
"Mercy and truth, mercy and truth,
mercy â
Ah, that exquisite soft swoop down
ward! The organ rippled on contented
ly a continuation of Edgar's flutelika
tonesâ "and truth are me-et together!"
There was all the richness of a
woman's voice, all the passionless
clearness of a boy's and all the morn
*lng innocence of a child's.
It occurred to him suddenly that the
north transept would be saferâ it was
on the side furtherst from home.
"Righteousness and peace, righteous
ness and peace have kissed each other!"
He wondered If Howard had learned
the uppercut since their encounter.
Tim's face was as the face of an
angel; a long slanting ray from the
rose-window fell across his curls.
"Have kissed each other," Edgar
â¢Ighed softly. "Have kissed each other"
âthe caressing tones melted Into the
organ's, whispered once more, "each
other," and died lingerlngly. A long
breath, an audible "Ah-h-h!" drifted
through the church. The choirmaster
kicked his feet together under the
organ for Joy. He little knew that at
that very moment the future , of his
vested choir was swlngln^jghtly in
the balance. ;
Butfsucb was the fact. Fat*, which
links together events seemingly iso
lated, smoothed Edgar's way. to his
flight, but allowed him to be beaten.
If this, had not happened, hla wrath
would not have vented itself In hector

"He taketh up the Islesâ as a ver-ryâ

"Shut up!" growled the bass.
"A ver-ry Ilt-tle thing!" Edgar con
tinued, malignantly, slipping, across his
victim's path.
â¢ "Oh, all right, .young feller." called
5 the bass, enraged at the grins and ap

â¢ "Who told yer?" he called.
,- :'7 "Aflk Fellowsâ and if he don't lick
you, I will!" retorted the bass, making

r evaded.
s He summoned his mates immediate

Tone nineteenth, eighteen hundred ana

/ puppy, to begin with. The whole affair
Irritated Edgar exceedingly. He saw
no explanation whatever. He perceived
.that he should have to fight the first
. alto. This was not only a great respon
sibility in Itself, but the necessity of
evading the parental eye added to tho
. nervous strain and the consciousness
that on this particular Sunday after
noonjlr. Ogden occupied one of the rear
pews, with the idea of seeing how he
behaved during service and ,subse
quently accompanying him home, eo

The rector noticed with pleasure the
seedy-looking man in the back of the
church; he was Just then 'smarting a
little under the accusation of "aristo
cratic tendencies;" a body of conser
vatives had never approved of the boy
choir. He hoped to get the man into
the Brotherhood of St. Andrew If he
were allied to no other organization.
On Sunday afternoon Edgar marched
Into the church, impassive ,' and unin
teresting to the outward vision, with
"Yep," replied the singer, "it was
me. Did yer think it was him?"
â¢with a slight Jounce to indicate his vic
tim.
"Get up, won't you, and sfflg me
â¢omething else." the choirmaster
urged. The boy rose promptly.
"What'll I sing?" he returned amic
ably. There had been a different tone
in the choirmaster's voice.
"Happy Home! Happy Home!" the
crowd demanded.
The choirmaster looked relieved. He
had no narrow prejudices, but he real
ized that a hymn like "My Happy
â¢Home" comes with good effect from
the parish hall windows.
"Where's your mouth organ?" de
manded the freckled one of a larger
boy in the crowd. The latter prompt
ly produced the instrument in ques
tion, cuddled it in both hands a mo
ment after the fashion of the virtuoso
and drew forth the Jerky and complex
scries of strains peculiar to it. It was
evidently a prelude â a tune vaguely
familiar to the choirmaster. Sudden
ly the boy's voice burst into this som
ber background:
I'd leave my yappy yome lor you, Oo-oo-oo-oo!
The choirmaster sighed ecstatically.
A voice so tender, so soft, so rich in
appealing inflections he had never
heard. The repeated vowels cooed;
they caressed; they allured.
You're tfcÂ» r. Ices' man n' I ever kr.oo, Oo-oo
co-oo!
""What's your name?" asked the
choirmaster, respectfully.
It appeared at first to be Egg Nogg,
but resolved into Edgar Ogden under
careful cross-examination, and ita
owner agreed to attend three weekly
rehearsals and two Sunday services
for the princely salary of 25 cents a
Â¦week, the same to be increased in
proportion to his progress.
Subsequent efforts proved that it was
utterly hopeless to attempt to teach
him to read music. "When Tim Mulialy
and the stupidest alto in the United
States â as the choirmaster assured him
â could stumble through what was con
siderately known as a duet at sight,
and that was the work of many
months. Edgar was still learning his
solos by ear. Once learned, however,
he never forgot them, and Mr. Fellows,
thrilled with pride as the silver stream
of his voice flowed higher, higher,
above the organ, beyond the choir at
his side, till the people in the church
sighed and craned their necks to look
at the wonderful boy.
As a matter of fact they looked, most
of them, at Tim Mulialy. As his ap
pealing expression and violet eyes were
undetachable he had all the effects of
the soloist and received most of the
credit from that vast majority. :. .
This mere apprehension was merci
fully unsuspected by Edgar, otherwise
it is to be feared that the services of
a physician would have been required
in the Mulialy household. Not that
Edgar had any professional pride in
his voice. He possessed, according to
his own ideas, many more valuable and
decorative qualities'. His power of song
was entirely hereditary and came to
him from his father.
Mrs. Ogden was not musical herself
and devoted most of her energies to fine
laundry work, a less emotional but
more lucrative occupation. Edgar's
professional duties interested, her
chiefly by reason of the Weekly salary,
now grown to 50 cents, of which one
tenth was ellowed him for his private
purpose, the remainder being applied to
the very obvious necessities of the
household. His consequent position as
wage-earner was firmly established,
and his mother, though she cherished
a natural contempt for the mental cal
iber of any young man who considered
Edgar's voice worth 50 cents a week,
Eaw to it that so remunerative an or
gan received all the consideration it de
served.
To Mr. Ogden's undisguised . horor,
two new suits of under flannels were
purchased at the beginning of the win
ter, and shiny storm rubbers were
urged upon the artist's reluctant feetÂ»
on every slushy day. The most uncon
vincing cou?h was rewarded with black
licorice purchased from the general
household fund, and when Edgar had
the measles "the Prince of Wales," to
use Mr. Ogden's irritated phrase,
"might have been glad to taste the
mutton broth and cocoa that fattened
that impident kid."
Xor was her system limited to this
soft indulgence, as the occasion of one
of the choirmaster's visit proved. Fear
ful lest the purpose of his call should
become evident too abruptly, he began
by one of hl3 customary eulogies of his
first soprano's voice. She received hia
enthusiasm coldly, indicated forcibly
her own lack of musical ability, and
boasted, with a pride inexplicable to
one who has not been accustomed to
consider this gift synonymous with
penitentiary qualifications, that she

Wiping her hands on her apron, Mrs.
Ogden assured the choirmaster that if
Edgar wasn't earning his wages she'd
attend to that part of it all right. So
intent was her expression that he felt,
obliged to put in a plea for gentle
ness, on the ground that such a deli
cate mechanism as the human throat
could not be too carefully treated.
Mrs. Ogden assured him that she was
not in the habit of applying her dis
ciplinary measures to the throat, and
the audience was at an end. Tho day
happened to.be Saturday, and at the
evening rehearsal It seemed to the
choirmaster that things had never gone
so smoothly.' After all, he thought^ It
needed a mother to reason with . the

the same nature that weekâ a mother

he was abundantly justified in his

himself to a study of* the rose window
over the transept. -
The decoration of this window was
a standing subject of quarrel between
him and his first alto, Howard Potter.
Edgar had advanced the somewhat
untenable proposition that the various
figures in the stained glass windows
represented the successive rectors and
choirmasters of St. Mark's. Howard
had objected that the dedications un
der the windows referred to persons
?who never held office of any kind in
the church.
Edgar had then fallen back on the
theory that the figures .were portraits
EDGAR CHOIR BOY
UNCELESTIAL& THE :SAN- FRANCISCO : SUNDXY^CAtt-iCHRISmAS NUMBER,
BEAD WORK THE
LATEST FAD
gEAD wot* is now quite th* rage,
i One firm in New York alone sold
.;.l*st year on an average of thou
sands of dollars worth of beads
â¢ -a* week. Think of it! Tons of
beads for the purpose of decorating the
fair necks and shoulders of America's
fairest population and for girdling their
supple and beautiful forms.
In the childhood of many a woman
who Is now In her fifties and sixties
beadwork was almost as popular as It
Is to-day. All the girls were taught the
art, and they threaded beads until their
eyesight suffered, and a large crop of
ocular troubles was developed for the
â¢ye specialists of . forty yeara later to
attend to. But noU- women as vellV*
girls have the crare. and have It bad,
and out of a hundred of those you meet
on the streets of New York, Boston,
Chicago, etc., fully one-half to two
thirds use beads of some kind upon
their persons for decorative purposes.
Yet, strange* though it may* appear,
the primitive bead worker was the In
dian woman. There is no white woman
to-day who can equal in beauty, va
riety and striking character of her de
signs Ihose of the EIoux, Wlnnebago and
other Indian women. They use beads
for decorating every possible article of
dress, as well as for articles of utility.
Cradles, moccasins, jackets, hat bands,
necklaces, girdles, anklets, wristletB,
dolls for babies, carrying bags for la
dies and tobacco pouches for the men.
The Sioux have always been great
bead workerF. but In the West the Mo
haves and Wallajiais are both expert
tribes. At The Needles, on the main
line of the Santa Fe, the Mohave wom
en meet the trains -with their hands full
of lon# strings of beads. They make a
specialty of necklaces, belts, collars and
watchfobs. It is interesting to watch
one who knows them trying to buy.
Picking out a long string the would-be
purchaser asks. "Peso cav-al-wee?"
(How many dollars?) The reply comes,
"Peso sit" (one dollar), or "Peso mee
hi-weeka" (one dollar and twenty-five
cents), or "Peso me-champ-pop" (one
dollar and fifty cents), or *'Pe3O mee
hl-weeka mee-champ-pop" (one dollar
and seventy-five cents). If the chafge is
too large the buyer expresses his disap
probation with a stern "Han-a-to-op
o-gi," which signifies "bad." If he is
satisfied he exclaims, "Han-nl-gle"
(good)) and the trade is made.
Figure 1 shows a Mohave 'woman at
the -reservation on the Colorado River,
Parker, Ariz., holding a loom made by
Professor Rapson of the United States
Indian School. Indians Mtemselres,
however, often strike the Â» pegs upon
which they do their work Into the
ground or upon a rude piece of wood.
Yet upon these rude looms .they pro
duce marvelous work, as will be seen
from later pictures, which represent a
variety of articles. There are belts,
collarettes, watch fobs, garters and a
battle ax, etc.
Figure 2 shows a Mohave Indian
making a collarette for her own use.
Here she has invented a loom to suit
her own purposes. She has made a
large oils, with a neck about as large
as her own, and upon that proceeded
to do her work, thus showing a keen
adaption of the limited materials to
the result she desired.
The Mohaves and Wallapals both
make 'a large number of plaited neck
laces, using two, four and six strands.
Figure 3 shows a flat braided necklace
and a watch fob, which I purchased
recently from a Mohave.
Figures 4. 5 and 6 are Mohave work.
The braid or plait is used In a variety
of ways to produce different but pleas
ing effects. Some are flat, others
round, others square.; In the upper
specimen of figure A the belt part is
woven In the usual manner on ths
loom, the two ends for tying being
braided from long strips of beads. Thus'
a novel and pleasing effect Is produced.
But it is in the belts and garters that
one gains an idea of their versatility in
making designs. Figure 7 shows some
of these . belts. Of course, an Infinity
of diversity can be gained simply by
choice Â»of different colors. Each, works
according to her own preference, but
some of them show -an appreciation of
harmony in colors that one would not

In more elaborate articles of dress
perhaps no bead workers, in the world
can equal the Sioux- In figure 8 are a
pair of moccasins and legglns Â¦ most
beautifully and tastefully adorned with
beads. To harmonize a design with the
peculiar shape of the foot, for instance,
is not always easy, yet ths.Bloux weav
er never makes any error in this direc
tion.
Of the meaning of these designs much
could be written â too much for the lim
ited spaoe at. my disposal.
The four bags pictured in Fig. t maka
fancy work bags, or even tobacco
pouches, and I know of one man whoee
purse Is one of these beautifully beaded
Bloux bags. The Indians use them for
carrying the "hoddentin** or sacred
meal, which they sprinkle constantly
whenever they wish to give a religious
significance to any act that they are
about to ocrform.
By far the most convenient loom yet
Invented Is the Apache loom, patented
by the Benham Indian Trading Com
pany of New York. (Bee Fig. 10.) It
consists of a flat board, on which are
two raised bridges, over which the
threads are connected at one end with
the retaining pegs, and at the other
with a revolving drum, upon which the
Â¦work can be rolled as fast "as a portion
of it Is completed. On this loom thou
sands of American women to-day are
enjoying the delisht of making articles
for their own personal adornment and
that of their friends.
A little side light upon the historic
Importance of yie old wampum or shell
brad belts may not be out of place here.
As is well known tne wampum or
beads of these belts are generally Ob
long tubes, about the fourth of an. inch
in length, shaped like a piece of to-
Xzttve sdpe win wiapuxs b<Â£ts tx to*
Istsaoo u flay that art iwtt a twain
and otlMra that h*ft betrn the MMaot
of lone, wearisome and costly TIMishâ
In the highest courts of oar land.
Hence It will be seen that bead Â¦ ill
has a -worthy and historlo lineage.
Those learned ln\he*e maters tall xa
that Hiawatha, the great formattre
spirit of the federation which limited
all the various tribes of the Iroquois,
the hero qf Longfellow's great poem,
was the inventor of the method of using
wampum belts as a means of conveying
messages and preserving records.
Indeed an Iroquois tradition olearly
states that he is the Inventor of the
wampum belt as his name implies. The
Indian of the name of Hayunwatha,
from ayunwa (wampum belt) and
katha (to make), hence he is *th*
maker of the wampum belt."

What Is Selinmf
We would like to hear some furthes
words from' Germany as to the dlsoor
ery in that state of a new metal, called
sellum, by its alleged discoverer, Ed
ward Mollard. For a substance that
has been newly found a surprising deal
appears to be known of its properties.
Mr. Mollard says it can be produced
at a cost only one-twelfth as great as
that of radium, that it is lighter and
stronger, does not nut, takes a fine
polish. Is useful for shipbuilding, pipes,
railroad construction, cooking utensils,
has greater resisting power than iron,
and a hardness somewhat less. Have
we been living for all these years oa
beds of sellum ore. so rich that steam
boats and railroad trains can be made
of it. and have not suspected it?
One Is tempted to suppose that what
is announced as a discovery means an
Invention merely, and that sellum is an
alloy; but you cannot alloy heavy
metals and secure a light-product. Mr.
Mollard seems to imply that the metal
exists in prodigious Quantities; hence
it Is astonishing that it has never been
discovered before. We are finding new
things In nature all the time, as wit
ness radium, but then, radium exists in
such small quantities that there Is per*
haps not an ounce of the free metal in
all America at this time. Theoretically,
you could do cooking and lighting and
heating with It. but, the fulfillment of
theory byÂ»practlce Is prevented by na
tural limitations as to quantity. Let
us hear something further about setJmn
before we accept all that has bean avid
of and for it.

his trousers rolled up to his knees and

\^ shovel, and I'll be a good

Now you might wonder what Jamie
Earle, a small boy who has spent his
four summers aboard a whaler, wants
a pail and a Ehovel for, for there isn't
very much available sand out in the
middle of the ocean, but Jamie has a
mind cf his own and what he wants
he wants badly, and like most small
bo? he gets It.
Jamie's father, be it known, is the
captain of the Charles P. Morgan, the
South Sea whaler that was caught In
the great tidal wave, so Just about
all the small man has to do is to lift
up his voice and the sailors rush madly
about and do the rest.
"I really think son has more to say
on board than his father," his mother
Eaid, as she captured him sliding down
a nearby rope. "The sailors mind his
pa 4 _ because they know they have to,
but they do ivhat Jamie says because
they like to."
"Oh, Jamie, boy. don't wiggle that
way," as he squirmed about like a
lively eel. "Tell us what you want
Santa. Claus to bring you, because I
think this lady will see him before I
do."
"Oh say, are you goin' to see him?"
And he stopped in his mad career and
scrambled up Into my lap for all the j
â¢world like a small monkey. "I want
a nice red pail like the one I saw in
the window and a shovel and a wheel
barrow and a horse and some pretty .
pictures and some candy," and when,*
he simply had to stop for want or
breath he gently patted my face and
smiled in a guileless fashion. 'Â¦'. ,V' â¢
Only four years old and yet such "a
master of the persuasive art. He's a
sailor born and bred, and if the old
saying that a sailor has a sweetheart
in every port is true, then Jamie Is evi
dently merely trying to live up to his
reputation.
"Oh, say," Bitting up and Investigat
ing the wheels in my watch, "Santa
Claus didn't forget all about me last
Christmas, even if I was an awful long
way away. Just see here," and he
swaggered down and commenced dig
ging in a diminutive pocket "He
brought me a watch and a chain and

to ehow the lady my gun. Oh, tell me
where it Is," and aTOyJtie went rolling
to the cause. Day after day. as the
Morgan cruises slowly along, keeping: a
sharp lockout for the cachalots, there

small man may be happy, perhaps you.
Mr. landlubber, are thinking. Yet it Is
infinitely more than that, as you would
know if the sea had claimed you for its
very own for a long, dreary monoton

the opening of the mystic papers, .
breaks into the sameness of the day,
and I'd be willing to wager my very
head that not on* of the Morgan's
crew would' lift a hand to keep the
captain's son ashore.
In his royal despotism he Is like a tin
god, and. whatever he say* goes, so
when he prayed for a thousand and one
things the sailors went out and bought,
even though they knew that dipping
into the slop chest would be the lnÂ«
evitable.
So it chanced that when the whaler
anchored in the stream there was a
great, mysterious hurrying and bus
tling about, putting queer-shaped bcy^
and bags safely out of sight, and t5&
last thing I heard, as she was being
towed out to sea, was a small voice 1
calling: "Please don't forget about my
pail and my shovel and my wheelbar
row If you Bee Santa Claug flnÂ»t. t *
Not all this Jubilee came from this
port, for there are queer-looking toys
that savor of Japan and China, of the
Philippines and the tropical islands.
Everything and anything that could be
picked up, and, besides all this, the
gifts that the sailors have fashioned In
their spare minutes.
Such a tree as there will be. It
wasn't on board, but a delegation had
volunteered to see that it would be
there in plenty of time if Mrs. Earle
would attend to the gee-gawa and the
glinting nothings that make a Christ
mas tree what it is.
"It's been awfully hard for me to buy
all the decorations for the tree on ac
count of the boy," Mrs. Earle said as
she brought up a handful of cornucopias
and strings and strings of pretty
bright-colored bells. "He's been land
sick ever since we have been in port,
and he wasn't content with that, but
he had to catch a beastly cold. What
do you think? For the first time in his
life he had the croup and had it so
badly that his father had to call a doc
tor in the middle of the night. But I'm
not worrying; he'll be all right Just as
soon as we lose sight of land." Â»
Generally It's quite the reverse with
the majority of us. About the time we
reach the Potato Patch we commence
to long for home and mother, and when
Â¦we actually get both feet planted flrmly
on good, solid terra flrroa there is am
ple cause for rejoicing. Landsick?
Just imagine.
Jamie narrowly escaped being a wa
ter baby. It Just happened that he
wasn't born at sea, but when he was a
â¢wee, small man he made his bow at
the helm and his tiny hand has been
felt there ever since. But he isn't to
be pitiedâ rather envied, for his life is
a happy rollicking one spent roaming
from country tbÂ« country and in having
just as good a' time as he' knows how.
When the weather is bright and
sunny he hitches up a team of sailors
and goes whirling about the deck at a
breakneck pace, and he is never quite
as happy as when the crew line up and
bet on the horses that can make the
best time. Then he is like a Roman
driver, standing In his chariot and
lending his small whlpjmd Bhrill voice
up a funny rag doll, and a black baby
at that. "He saw It in the windp^ and
asked for it, but I told him that papa
never would get over laughing at him
for wanting to play with dolls, like
girls, and he didn't say another word
to me. But that night his father told
me that Jamie had asked what he
wouid think if he had a nigger baby,
and so here he is. He certainly isn't
much for pretty, but he is the very one
he wanted, so that make3 all the differ
ence in the world.
"You see, he hasn't very much room
to play in, and no earth at all, so this
year we are going to take a great sand
box and turn him loose in it. His
father said it could be built in one end
of the ship, and that's the reason he
wants a pall and shovel. He saw some
children on the beach, and he thinks it
would be pretty fine."
Oh, such perfect stacks of things as
that youngster will have. A great hob
by-horse that will rock him to Dublin
town and back in a few minutes: a
beautiful coaster with a new-fangled
brake on it, books by the score, candy
that is piled so high one can scarcely
see over it and the usual odds and ends
that always delight the heart of a
child. - : v* : *.

BOY'S CHRISTMAS
ABOARD A WHALER
By Madge Moore
good excuse, don't you know, to cele
brate. You would hardly believe that
these great rough men are more pleased
than baby with some trifle, and they
can hardly wait until dinner time."
The dinner part appealed most
emphatically to me as I looked at the
black natives of Guam, the queer
looking little Portuguese with cruel
knives tucked handily away In their
scarlet belts and the dull, stolid faces
of the very few fair men that help
to make up their crew. It wasn't
hard to believe that catering to their
etomach might be one of their great
est concerns, but that a ; woman's
homely remembrances might find
favor in their eyes was almost one too,
many for me. I rather accepted it

and her baby are safe, but what
would happen if one of the murderous
looking crew should stick a knife In
his ..back? It isn't pleasant to con

sition full well.
"When we were in the midst of the
tidal '-. wave my husband worried a
good', deal about the California, be
cause she leaked badly when she left
port; and as soon as we sighted the
Alice , Knowles he wanted to go a
'gamming.'
"For five whole days Jamie and I

would be hurt by falling timbers or
carried away by. the high seas, but'
when I heard he , was going over ta
26That was so long ago! But whenever
anything rattles and pattens she shuts
her eyes quickly, and sees for a mo
ment the dark room and the square
white counterpane, and hears her
mother singing "Mary of Argyle." She
wonders if when we die and go to
heaven we srÂ» reminded by little sights
and sounds of what we used to do on
earth. Of course, we shall do only
pleasant things there, but they might
remind us of the pleasant things hereâ
the pasture in the early morning, when
it is so still and cool and almost
strang-e? the barn, full of sweet piles of
hay, musical with amber sunlight; a
fairly palace, on whose fragrant divans
one eits with Sultans and slavegirls,
and listens to Sindbad and Aladdin;
the shady porch, where cool white milk
and dark shiny gingerbread wait the
weary berry-stained wanderer. In the
brown book in the parlor Is a poem
about a little girl who used to "take
her little porring-er and eat her supper
there," The Child feels like that little
girl when she eats on the porch.
There is another little girl in the
brown book â "Sweet Lucy Gray." She
think* of Lucy when she comes home
alone tt dusk, and quickens her steps.
How frightened ehe would be! Not
that the Child has been foolishly
taught to fear. Only that she Is
imaginative and knows enough to be
afraid.
Suddenly comes the grating sound of
something dragged over the floor, and
the door opens. The Child pushes out
with a little wooden rocking chair and
a great tin pan heaped with unshelled
peas. Her blue-checked apron la tied
by the waistband around her neck â it
Is a grown woman's apron, and covers
her and tha chair, which Is far too
email for her now. But one cannot be
always eight years old, and when one
Is II shall one relinquish without a
pang the birthday gifts of one's child
hood?
She lays the pan beside her and puts
a handful of peas Into her blue-checked
lap. She presses her brown little thumb
against the sharp green edge and drags
It down the pod. Out patter the little
green balls, and rattle Into the pan.
Truly, a pleasant sound! Like the rain
on the roof. When she was very little
and slept with her mother, she woke
once In the night, and It was raining
hard. The thunder frightened her, and
her mother comforted her and sang her
to sleep in the bed. And when the
lightning flashed and all the room was
bright and dreadful, her mother told
her to keep her eyes chut and then the
flashes would not trouble her. So she
screwed her eyes hard together and
held her mother's hand and drifted oft
to sleep.
THE sun-glare lies on the road and
the field and the house. There are
only three little white clouds In
all the warm blue sky. No one
passes up or down the road.

"Lady," say a one of the slaves, bow

not raise her eyes. How will he look?
What gift will he bring? She sinks her
Let us think of pleasant things! Peas
are so small If you count them by ones!
If people considered whenever they
gobbled peas so quickly that every one
had to be shelled by one poor, tired'
little girl! But no, they eat them with
out a thought of how she sat In tha
little tight chair and rattled them Into
the pan- If they were only rich enough
to leave the chair and the peas and the
farm and go to a city!' What city?
Oh, New York or Boston or Persia. In
Persia the days are full of richness
and the nights are Arabian. Along the
streets walk veiled and lovely women
â does it matter that to the Child their
veils are of the dull blue cotton that
wreathes her mother's hat? By all the
Persian monarchs, no! â driving black
dogs and white hinds, followed by tur
baned slaves and glaring eunuchs, with
misty genii hovering in the back
ground. They enter a frowning por
tal â but let us pretend!
This is Persia. The streets are nar
row; the people Jostle and crowd to
one side a little girl in a blue-checked
apron. She walks along unknown, un
noticed. Wait! Who is this? It is a
slave in a turban with a scimitar flash
ing with jev.-els. lie bows low.
"I am bidden to tell you that your
presence is desired by my master,
lovely maiden!" The lovely maiden
looks haughtily at him.
"I will follow you, Slave," che says.
They go on to a lov.', narrow door. The
slave says a magic word and the door
Bwing3 open. Through a long passage
and a great hall they go. There bursts
upon them a radiance of light. Flowers
fill the air with an unearthly fragrance.
Golden goblets and ruby pitchers stand
on silver salvers with "dried fruit,
cakes and sweetmeats, which give an
appetite for drinking." Lovely slave
girls lead the maiden to the bath and
attire her in rich and costly robes.
They seat her in a golden chair and
give her a bowl of seed pearls to string.
(These are the pearls.) She lifts her
lovely head and says in a voice of sil-
There are strange things In the Bible.
One is commanded to refrain from do
ing so many things that one never
would do anyway. But those things
must have been done by the Israelites
and the Pharisees and the Hlttltes and
the Publicans. Then did God mean that
Ihe Americans must keep the same
laws? But Americans were free and
equal. They threw over the tea, and
with a wild whoopâ waitl let us pre
tend! , ;
This Is Boston. It is still and quiet.
Night is dark all around. Soft and
stealthy come footsteps â tha Indians!
They gather from the shadows of the
trees and houses, they wave their tom
ahawks exultantly, they glide to the
wharf. In their path stands a little
girl in a blue-checked apron. She falls
upon her knees in terror.
"Save me!" she cries. The chief
laughs a horrid laugh; he raises his
tomahawk â the dog barks loud and the
child nearly drops the peas on her lap,
so frightened she is.
"I thought they were real! I thought
they were coming!" she whispers to
herself. 4
"Why did you want to go?" she
said. The Child could not telL
"It made me cry," she answered,
"but I felt good, too. I want her to
tell my brother that I am pretty
well, and that I hope he is tha same,
when she gets to heaven. Do you sup
pose she will get there by to-night?"
They talked about her conduct on
that occasion bo strangely and so long
that she never spoke any more with
them about death or the life after it'
But she thought about these things.
She wondered whether Mary Waters
remembered the secret place they
made together in a hollow gate post.
Mary Waters had a way of sometimes
telling things not quite as they really
were. Did she do so now? Or had
she told enough lies to send her to
hell? For liars inherit hell. It la
not that this fact has been Impressed
upon her mind by others, but she has
heard it in the Bible and heard it
read.
bands deep In the pearls. Ah, what
is that? A great sweet bough drops in
the pan.
"Your gran-ma wants" them peas!"
says the Prince In genial rebuke. Alas!
And did Haroun-al-Raschld speak
through his nose?
The child stares at him, dazed.
"Theseâ these are pearls!" she. says.
"I am stringing them for my girdle!
Does your Highness desire that I should
wear thisâ this carbuncle?"
His Highness laughs loud and long.
"It's > a sweet bough," he ; chuckles,
"and and I guess you had better eat It
right up, now," One moment of weaver
ing: shall awful wrath* come upon this
desecrator of the I soul's best rites, or
good fellowship and feasting be given
him? She' scowls, she shrugs her
aproned shoulders, she glances from
beneath her. lashes, she. smiles.
f\ "Fll give you half," she announces.
After all, it is hardly probable that the
Prince would have helped her shell the
peas. And William Bearles will. If he
Is only the chore boy boy. Vain hope!
"I got to drive the chickens 'round
back," he demurs/ "I can't spend my
time ehellln'^pâ¬fes. Your gran'ma says
if you don't get 'em done pretty soon
you can't-go over to Miss Salome's this
afternoon. She says you're a dreadful
slow child!" - -
This is the last straw. The Child
rises with what would Indeed be a
"They Seat Her In a Golden l Chair and Give Her a /Bo wl of Pearls to fftring. 1^
"But you will come next week?" sh*
asks. And the Child's face lights up.
"Oh, yes. 111 surely come next week,
surely," she replies with emphasis. So
she goes around to Miss Salome's chair
and the beautiful ringed hand raises
her face and strokes her freckled cheek.
"Good-by. my Sunshine!" she says. The
Child catches the hand In a rush of lov
ing worship and kisses It. >.,''Â»;"
"I win never be cross to William
Bearles again, never!" she cries. "I will
be good to everybodyâ even to stupid
people!" Miss Salome pinches her cheek
and laughs.
And the Child goes out and down tha
steps of the terrace, rapt, wondering,
lifted to a height of love and admtrattoa
that keeps her little soul to Its sweet
est, highest pitch torâah, measure not
the time, I beg you! The children who
are older â how long do the glow and
flush remain with them? They can only
say, "There will be another!" and wait
for It as well and* patiently as may be.
The Child goes back to the life of ev
ery day and , embroiders Its dull web
with eyes of peacocks and sifts Into It
the ecent of sandal wood and sets It
weaving to the tune of ballads, quaint
and sweet. Yet she has taken into an
other's web, unknowing, a tiny thread
of happiness that weaves through the
tarnished cloth of silver and blesses the
pattern as It grows. And the Master eÂ£
the Looms has planned It all.
"If I make my guests unhappy they
will not care to come again," she says.
"Ring for Peter, dear child." So the
child taps the bell and Peter comes
gravely In with the beautiful silver
tray and In a flutter of delight the
child forgets the song and the picture.
Miss Salome cuts the dark frosted
cake and dishes Into glass plates the
candled ginger, floating In syrup, and
pours out a cup of real tea. "And the
Fairy Princess Is served with a ban
quet worthy of her dreams. Oh, to bÂ«
at last In Miss Salome's mansion!
The clock chimes for half-past fire.
Heaven Is over. She brushes tha
crumbs to a little heap oa her gflt
rlmmed plate.
"I must go now, I think," she says
with obvious effort. Her hostess)
smiles.
freezing dignity were it not that with
her rises the birthday chair. "Wil
liam," she begins. But more suddenly
than Is consistent with her tone she
sinks back. William sits upon the
grass shaking with laughter.
"You looked so awful funny, so awful
funny!" he gasps. The Child hangs for
a moment between tears and laughter.
Then she accepts .the situation and
laughs as merrily as tha chore boy.
"I was pretending I was a princess,"
she explains. "I "
"Ho!" rejoins William, "you alnt Ilka
s princess! You don't look like the
ones you tell about, anyway; Why"â
as she glares at him over the apron,
â¢â¢your hair's red, red! An* your eyes
are kind o' green, they are! An* you're
Just Jam-packed full o* freckles! I
gueess I know well enough how they
look, and you ain't like 'em I"
The tears stand In her eyes, but she
will not let them fall.
*T don't care, William Searles," she
says bravely, "I may look freckled, but
I don't feel sotv And it's better to know
how they look than * But no I She
Is an honest Child, with all her imagin
ings. Bhe knows that It Is better to
look like them than to know about
themt better for the maiden and the
prlnee, at least. William waits for the
sentence. She begins again.
"William Bearles," she says solemnly,
'Â» wouldn't you rather I could tell you
about those princesses than look like
them?" William's eyes sparkle greed
ily.
"Ton bet!" he replies with fervor.
The Child sighs with relief.
"All right," she says, "then dont
complain." .
i She Is alone again, and only Wil
liam's faint and fainter Invitations to
the chickens break the silence. The
peas fly Into the pan. Suppose she
should be kept from Miss Salome's!
But no, that shall not be. She looks
ahead to the happy afternoon, singing
as she works.
And nowâ and now the time has
come. The dishes are wiped, the cat
fed and the fennel picked for the long
sermon to-morrow. She, her very self.
In her new dotted lawn walks carefully
up the hill to the big house, terraced
and gravel-pathed. She knocks timidly
at the brass ring and the tall colored
butler. letÂ» her In. He Is the only In
door man servant she has ever seen,
and she reverences him greatly. He
smiles condescendingly at her, \ as he
â¢miles not upon all the country people*
"If miss will walk up," he says. Bhe
goes up the soft-carpeted stairs Into
the upstairs drawing-room. She draws
a long breath of happiness and wonder
ever new, and makes her little cour
tesy to Miss Salome.
Out of the dim, delicious dusk of the
room come slowly the familiar treas
uresâthe high polished desk, the great
piano, the marvelous service of delft
that fills a monstrous sideboard In the
distance; the chairs, all silk and satin
and shining wood; the great pictures
In gilt frames. In the largest chair sits
Miss Salome. Will the child ever tire
of looking at her pale-lined face, her
silver high-dressed hair, her beautiful
hands sparkling with rings, her
haughty mouth, her tired, troubled
eyes? She must nave been almost as
lovely as the Princess Angelica once.
But she smiles so seldom. Bhe puts out
her hand.
"And what has happened slnoe last
Baturday?" she says.
The Child laughs for pure Joy. To
talk, to describe, to venture at analy
sis, to ask the why and wherefore, to
Illustrate by gesture as vivid as her
speechâ these things are her happiness.
To be suffered this joy in snatches Is
much, to have it demanded, and for one
whole afternoon. Here is no one to
reprove, no one to blame the idle
hands, no one to question the propriety
of mimicry or to insist on her sitting
In her little chair.
Miss Salome watches her flitting
about the dusky parlor, her reddish
gold hair gleaming now against the
delft blue, now against the polished
mahogany desk. She tells of the
chickens that lost their mother. She
wanders about clucking for her brood
and cooing over the returned prodigals.
She walks across the room as William
doesâ her slouching gait, open mouth,
drawling voice. Irresistibly perfect. She
describes the shooting star, that seem
ed to her like a lost spirit, gone to
sorrow and the earth.
"It makes me think of 'Lucifer, son
of the morning, how art thou fallen!* "
â¢he says, solemnly. "I wonder how
that star felt. Miss Salome?"
There Is a long pause. The lady
sighs, i
Then, "You may read, If you like,**
she says at last.
The Child's face flushes for Joy* Bhe
runs to the bookcases and brings out
a small brown book. She fingers lov
ingly the tree-calf that covers the
precious pages, and opens them before
she finds her â¢ chair. She curls up on
a great satin ottoman and smooths the
leaves. Where is' the farm? Where
the peas? Where William? They are
less -than shadows, more unreal than
dreams. Her voice trembles as she be
gins:
"And now. your Highness permitting,
I shall relate to your Majesty one of
the most surprising adventures ever
known to your Majestyâ' " Ah, It Is
good to have been a child . and per
fectly happy.
What do children know of life, she
thinks, whÂ» play with tops and dogs
and kittens? There are books In the
world. And they own all lands and
seas and peoples who own ftios*
printed leaves. Even Miss Balome
does not know as much as the books.
Even Miss Salome cannot say such
carious wonderful things. Why is
Miss Salome so good to her? In
heaven will they see each other? "In
my father's house ara many man
sions." Supposa she should bÂ« put In
Miss Salome's? Will the "Arabian
Nights" be there? When she lifts her
eyes from tho book they fall on an
Immense peacock-feather fan. It
glows on thÂ« wall, and the eyes dilate
and tremble and satisfy her hungry
little soul with the color she loves. On
-Â«. small table near her stands a
sandal-wood cabinet. Its faint sweet
smell mingles with tha spices and
gums of the tale, and should a Genius
spring from the cover and bow to the
ground before them, she would not
be surprised.
With a sigh of pleasure she releases
the princess and outwits tha evtl
spirit.
" 'And "now 11 your Majesty would
care to listen to tho story of the Fish
erman â¢ "
"That Is enough," says Miss Sa
lome. . "Are you tired ?*â¢ The Child's
eyes answer her.
"Then sing to mÂ»,"
"What shall I 8108;?** says the Child.
"â¢Lord Lovell'?"
"If you like," 'answers Miss Sa
lome.
Tha Child rises and stands before
tho great chair. Her face ts raised
and serious. She knows only ballads,
but to her they are opera and sym
phony In one. She clasps her hands
and begins:
Lord LovelJ b* atoed at Us ea*tle v*M,
A-comb!ac hla milk whlta stead.
When out cam* I*dy Nancy Batl
To vriah her lover rood Â»p*-nÂ« Â»Â»4,

Her voice tings true as a bed. Miss
Salome smiles at the eager little face.
-% She carries them through fateful
Verses and unconsciously softens and
saddens her voice at the woeful end*
Ing. V
Miss Salome applauds vlgarouxtr.
"Once more," she begs.
The Child's heart grows btf wtth
happiness. That she should lor* tt so,
and yet with tt pleasure others! It Is
too much Joy. She will mak* a (pedal
prayer to-night and thank God, as
does her grandmother, for xir.axacctad
bounty.
"I win sing â¢Come Wlfa Thy bate/ m
she* says. It Is a quaint, old-fashioned
tune, and her voice rises and falls and
reaches for the notes with an almost
pathetio feeling for their beauty.
She looks at the lovely lady fa ths>
white satin gown In the great gold
frame before her. How beautiful she
must have been! She died when she
was very young. Her husband shot
himself with grief for her. She might
have sung that song to himâ who
knows? The Child chokes and swal
lows her tears at the end of the song,
and when she looks at Miss Salome she
sees that her eyes, too, are full of
tears.
"Oh, I have made you cry! I asa
sorry â so sorry I"
Miss Salome wipes her eyes.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL. âCHRISTMAS NUMBER.
If she could have one wish In all
her life she knows what it would be.
A beautiful gold watch all chased
Â¦with figures and a cherry-colored rib
bon tied into the handle. Then she
â¢would put it into her waist â but
her dresses open In the back! The
disadvantages of youth are obvious
enough, in all conscience, without that
last pathetic touch. When can she
have a separate waist and skirt?
Suppose she should die before she
grows old enough to attain this glory?
People have died when they were
young â much younger than she. The
little Waters girl died and she was
only 9. The Child went to the funeral,
but not with her mother. She
slipped into the kitchen and listened
at the door. When she told her
mother that she had gone her mother
looked at her so strangely.
THE HEART OF A CHILD
27The Â¦ King of Dahomey had detained
the Englishman, Rutherford, to witness
the annual customs, and the most' atro
cious part of the whole dreadful rite
was now in celebration. The savage
subjects of the savage monarch crowd
ed the stifling market 'place, variously
armed, . and eyes with ". the / lust of
slaughter in them were fixed on three
long and narrow baskets In the center.
In each basket lay bound a living man,
an alligator, a cat and a hawk; no pen
would describe the: faces of the three
human sacrifices. ,-' r : â¢'â¢'Â¦
Â¦Oh a signal from the King, twelve
Amazonsâ great," brawny, " half-naked
womenâ seized- the baskets, four to

In a spasm of uncontrollable fear the

nearer and nearer. Then the Sheriff

taking up the baskets again, hurled
them among the people; and almost be
fore they had ceased falling the live
sacrifices were hacked and battered to
pieces. Then the Englishman was , al
lowed to go.
.He fled in horror, his ears filled with
the shrieks of the crowd, | his terrified
. fancy renewing every detail of the
massacre. He fled as far as the Jun
gle, and in the thick white jungle fog
the man was swallowed up and lost.
As he wandered the horrid nausea of
j the. swamp came over him, and by and
by he reeled and fell. The cold, dry
harmattanâ wind of the north or north
eastâwas blowing; and in the middle
of the night the: Englishman awoke
with a shiver, and j a kind ' of sub-con
sciousness that something was happen

the strange procession of the- ghosts.

Usually on entering the prison the
hangman took stock of his victim
through the spy-hole in the door of the
cell, to judge what length of rope would
settle him quickest. He nodded vaguely.
"AH right, you know your way; here's
the Sheriff coming. I must fetch the ;
Governor."
The hangman crept through the gas
lit, noiseless corridors until he stood at
the door of the condemned cell. Within
could be heard the voice of the chap
lain faintly raised In prayer. The hang-,
man shook, he knew not why; he was
in dreadful fear of the coming on of his
fit, when it would be Impossible for him
to fasten the straps and adjust the
rope. .How . was his fear a thousand â¢
fold enhanced when, on tiptoe at the
spy-hole, he beheld the very face that'
had terrified him in the train!" It was
the doomed man himself, kneeling (.at
the side of the clergyman and gazing,
as it were full at" the hangman, of
whose presence on the other Bide of the
door he could not be aware.
i The Jest of the porter, "Been travel
'ing with a ghost?" slipped through* the
hangman's mind, and he thought: " "He
came to get at me, and push me out o'
the train, so's I shouldn't, have him."
He was certain that until .this moment
he had never -before ' seen , - the con
demned man in the flesh, ; and remem
bered that in the train he had' seen the
face only, though positive that hands
t
silver balls, produces a most festive ef
fectâalmost as if one had come into a.
Christmas tree, forest. Where holly is
difficult to obtain, bows of bright red
ribbon are very effective. Single holly
leaves can be used as guests' name
cards, written on with gold paint; or
they make pretty little Christmas cards
to slip into parcels if appropriate mot
toes are written on them.
If the partv given is a dance, then
there is very little to suggest in the
way of novelty, for everything pro
ceeds on well-known lines. The floor
is polished, or a dancing cloth Is laid
down; as good music as possible Is ob
tained, and a supper of more or less
elaborate description is provided. Now
this is all very well where the children
are old enough to dance properly, but
as the ages at children's parties are
apt to vary considerably, as it is usual
to invite the whole family, the younger
ones arc likely to be either a little dis
appointed or knocked about and driven
Into corners by themselves. I have
found it a good plan to devote the
earlier part of the festivity to the lit
tle ones, and then, after gathering all
of them together for a tea; and sending
the "tinies" home, the older ones are
at liberty to dance and behave in as
grown-up a fashion as they please, and
so both divisions are satisfied.
And now to consider the game3. We
"But there was no 'un here' then."
"Well, there's no 'un here now, 'cept
you, far as I can see. Been travelln'
with a ghost?"
The hangman, still clutching his bag
tightly, stepped across to a four
wheeled cab.
The vast prison was full of the
strange, silent bustle that marks a gal
lows morning. Only the officers were
about, however: prisoners are locked
in their cells till the /act is complete.
Every one moved stealthily, nothing
was spoken above a whisper. The chap
lain had arrived and was with the con
demned man.
The hangman, staggered and mysti
fied by that Inexplicable passage in the
train, which he was afraid. to speak of,
had hoped for news of a reprieveâ
which, indeed, had been generally ex
pectedâbut the chief warder told him
went on struggling, as though seek
ing to free himself from some one. The
bag with the rope and pinioning straps
had fallen on the floor.
"Ah, you've gone!" exclaimed the
hangman. "But I'll keep a watch for
you, and, mark me, I'll know your
face." The light was extinguished in
the carriage. The hangman groped for
his bas, felt in it and found his gal
lows' tackle safe, and kept It clutched.
In the dare of the lamps at Kings
Cross he looked around, and saw that
he was alone in the carriage.
"Where did we stop last?" he asked
of the porter who opened the door.
"PeterbroV *

"Time enough," rejoined the little
hangman, quietly.
Time enough! What thought the man
in the condemned cell, whose death was
fixed for Â» a. m.?
The train launched itself again upon
the dark winter's night; no other

executioner, recruiting from an ague,
hugged himself in his long yellow frieze
and set about Bleeping. He was a
flute maker on week days, and when
he traveled by night on a hanging er

X^THRISTMAS!
f / To come the gravestone of a dead de-
I / < n K ht.
VL/ To some the landmark of a new do-
main.
Well, I do not propose to, discuss
gravestones in this little Christmas
chat. I will leave them to the writ
ers of those gruesome ghost stories
which are not yet "dead delights" at
this season of the year. Landmarks
and new domains are more to my lik
ing at present, especially the former.
Even if they are not of sufficient im
portance to engage the attention of
the ordnance surveyors, children's
parties and Juvenile entertainments
of all sorts are very j real landmarks
in the lives of the little onesâmemo
ry's milestones, which,, as we grow
older, we should be very loth to lose;
oases of "make-believe" In the desert;
of "matter-of-fact," where the col
ored candles are always alight, where
presents arrive from all sorts of . un
expected places and where we may
eat all the things which at other times
are specially forbidden. There is
very little to say to the children on the
subject; they shut their eyes and open
their sweet little mouths in complete
confidence that what they are going
to get is sure to be nice, because, of
course, they are loved so much. But
I would beg the older ones not to
leave out those they do not feel "call
ed upon" to include in any fun that
is going forward. Few of us have
enough wisdom to select, none of us
to exclude; and If our hearts have
been flung a little wider open at this
'season we shall feel all the better, de
pend upon it.
The preparations, for Christmas and
its attendant festivities are not the
least enjoyable features of thelfuletide
programme. Set the young people to
work at weaving garlands and wreath3
as Boon as the holidays begin, which is
not usually long before Christmas day
itself. Ropes stretched between two
chairs and pieces of evergreen placed
crisscross on them make very pretty
festoons of greenery; holly can be
j sparingly used . among laurels and
such like cheaper growths; and, of
course, the mistletoe is always wel
come. Prettiest of all, however, are
tiny fir trees, or boughs so cut as to re
semble them. On the occasion of a
party a series of these fastened so as
to stand upright on the outside of the
banister rail up the staircase, each
hung with little different colored quick^
>Â¦ ' Â¦'Â¦''Â¦Â¦. /
do not want them to be too rough for
best clothes, but all the little folks
must enjoy themselves to the utmost,
and to this end it is well to have a
list made out beforehand, and to note
down the names of children upon
â¢whom you can count as "leaders." Lit
tle prizes of bon-bons done up in small
parcels, tiny Japanese fans, penny â¢
dolls, or little books give an added in
terest to competitive games, but In no
case should they be things of much
value. Games should follow in quick
succession to prevent the boys sliding
up and down the room, or trying each
other's strength, which is apt to upset
the harmony of the entertainment. A
very good game is called the "Extin
guisher." After clearing the room,
and arranging the little guests on either
side of it, a candle la lit at the far end
from the door; one of the children is
then blindfolded, and has to find his
way to the candle and blow it out. Ha
can be guided by the rest calling "hot"
or "cold," but It is really more amusing:
in complete silence, when he frequently
blows in quite a wrong direction. All
the attempts should have a time limit,
otherwise it gets wearisome to both
actor and onlooker.
A table-game called "Blowball"
originated In America. Tapes are
stretched round the table for
boundaries. Pencils are used for goals,
while an esg-shell pierced and "blown"
is used as a ball. Players sit round the
table and blow the shell about as a ball
is kicked In a game of football. Cap
tains are chosen, who select their sides,
and once a player has taken his posJ-^
tlon he; may not leave it. '^L
Just one more new game, and then,
I think, with the addition of some of
the old favorites the children would .
not like to do without, the party ought â¢*
to be a success. This Is the "New
Blindman's Buff," where no one ia
.blindfolded, but the 'one who is to play
the part of bllndman is seated on a
footstool facing a stretched white sheet
â Just as you would arrange one for a
magic lantern. Some way behind him
a candle is put on a table; then the
children pas3, one at a time, between
the light and the blind man. throwing
their shadows on to the sheet, and, by
their shadows, he has to guess who it
is that is passins behind him. The
child whose name he guesses correctly
has to take his place. It Is a pretty
game, and possesses a good deal of
interest. Care must be taken to have
the blind man seated sufficiently low,
so as not to cast his own shadow on the
sheet.
But when all Is said and done, the
preparation for Christmas, its secrets,
its shopping expeditions, are half the
joy of the festival to the youngsters,
and if we elders. are wise we will allow
them as much scope in this direction
as we are able. We grumble over the
inordinate length of our list of names
for our Christmas shoppings, V^k'
- would our hearts be any the lighter to?
the absence of one of those names, and
the knowledge that never again could
anything be purchased for him saveâ
"rosemary, for remembrance"?
Â¦
Then followed some very lovely
scenes from Tennyson's poems. Among
them, one from "The Princess." where
the Princess and her train of "sweet
girl graduates" are resting in her tent
with the three disguised students in
women's dressâ the Prince, Florian and
CyriL The tent is very beautiful, in
embroidered silk and eatln. In the mid
dle is a tripod, from which rises "a
fragrant flame." They have fruit and
flowers and wine set out before them,
and the girls recline about on cushions
in their college robes, - the Lady
Blanche's pupils in daffodil yellow and
the Lady Psyche's in pale lilac One of
the girls takes a harp and sings the
Bong, "Tears, idle tears," and then the
Prince sings, "O swallow, Bwallow, fly
ing, flying south." The grouping of
the college maidens was very graceful
and artistic. There were several wrong
guesses as to the origin of this scene,
one being that it was out of the comic
opera "Patience."
This scene was a very short one. It
represented Sir Lancelot du Lac
bringing the diamonds he has won In
tournament to Guinevere. He comes to
the Queen in a leafy bower, and, kneel
ing, gives her the Jewels with a beau
tiful lover's speech. She receives them
coldly and lays them down on the table
near her. .Answering him with a speech
of passionate jealousy, she ends by
seizing them again and throwing them
out of the window into the river. The
whole of her speech was not repeateri,
as In It she mentions Sir Lancelot by
name, and also Arthur, thus giving too
distinct a clew to her own identity.
There is an infinite variety of subjects
from the poets that are well known or
otherwise which lend themselves to this
sort of representation, and even some
of the best known are not so readily
guessed as one might imagine.
of the stage on the figure. A pale
blue light produces the proper ghostly
effect. This charade Is taken front
ecene 3 of act 6 of "King Richard
IIL"
of, but she must leave that day month.
'Scene II, "Tiff."â A pretty drawing
room or conservatory; a ybung girl and
her lover talking together. The girl is
jealous of some attentions she thinks
.the young man has been paying to an
other girl; she is very cross and pet
tish with him; then he also becomes
irritated, and they have a regular
quarrel. At last she says she is sure
they can never be happy together, and
she would rather break off the engage
ment. : The young man begs her not
to ruin both their lives for a tiff. He
h-3 some trouble in persuading her to
make it up, and at the end he says:
"It was nothing but a tiff, after all,
b; v 't frightened me."
Scene III (whole word), "Plaintiff.' â
A court of Justice. Judge In wig and
Thtre Is a pretty, new variation of
the old-fashioned Christmas charades.
In our young days the charade was a
Quite impromptu affair. The host or
hostess at a Christmas party suggested
charades, and the company forthwith
divided Itself into two parties â actors
end audience, the audience remaining
in the drawing-room while the actors
went out, and, on the spur of the mo
ment, selected a word, which they
then acted before the audience, using
*uch dresses and materials as came to
hand, and the audience were required
to guess the word acted before them.
A more picturesque and more elabor
ate effect is produced if the charades
ere rehearsed beforehand, the actors
#Tiosen and the dresses in character.
At one country house, instead of the
isual three or four syllable word of
three or more acts, part of a scene
from one of Shakespeare's plays was
flven by the actors; and all those In
the audience who eucceeded in guess
tig from which play the scene was
liken, and in giving the names of the
Itiaracters represented, received little
fcmvenir prizes, after the fashion of
Jte cotillon prizes. The first charade,
Â»s It may be called, ttfat was acted
9&s from "King Henry V" â that
fuaint little scene where Henry V tries
lo woo the French Princess Katherlne
in her own tongue and she tries to an
rwer him in English. There are only
three characters â King Henry, in his
warrior's dress, as he has come from
the battlefield, and with his crowned
helmet on his head; the Princess
Katherine, very tall and 6tately, in a
picturesque high sugar-loaf hat, with
a fine lace veil falling from it. and a
fourteenth century dress of rich bro
cade, trimmed with ermine, falling in
long folds about her feet. ,Ehe is at
tended by her maid of honor, Alice,
â¢who wears a little, tight-fitting cap,
and is somewhat older than her mis
tress. The scene is part of scene 2, act
f. of "King Henry V," when the French
King and Queen, the lords and ladies,
etc., have gone out and left these three
together, and begins, "Fair Katherlne
and most fair." A great par^t of
Henry's rather long speeches was cut
out, but the broken English of the two
ladles, and his rather rough French,
had a piquant effect, and the dresses
were charming.
Another scene was from the "Mer
chant of Venice," one that is rather
less well known than that where Portia
appears in her doctor's robes, which is
rather too obvious for guessing pur
poses. In this the curtain went up on
a room in Portia's house, where the
three caskets are kept, from which her
suiters are to choose. A fair and sra
cious Portia, a dark-skinned and gor
geous Prince of Morocco, with both
their trains of lords and ladies, were
the dramatis personae, and they gave
the ehort and animated scene 7 of act
2 of the play, in which the Prince of
Morocco, a suitor for the hand of Por
tia, stands before the three caskets of
gold, silver and lead and debates with
himself which is most likely to contain
a favorable answer to his Buit, finally
, choosing the golden casket. In which he
finds a Death's head, with the scroll.
gown. Counsel for plaintiff and de
fendant, clerk of the court, etc. The
plaintiff seeks to recover Â£10 damages
from the defendant for the loss of one
of her locks of hair, cut off by the
said defendant without the real and
actual consent of the lady. The case
as stated was that the two parties ba
came friendly, and the defendant, tak
ing advantage of the unusual amiabil
ity and graciousness of the lady, took
a pair of scissors and in play deprived
the said lady of one of her pretty and
valuable locks. Amusing examination
of witnesses follows. The Judge gives
the c-.se for the* plaintiff, and the court
applauds. .
"Penitent" is another good word for
a charade.
Scene I, "Penny."â A family of poor
people. Father, mother and several
children discovered talking. Torn, the
eldest boy. Is absent for the moment.
From the conversation It appears that
he has ! found a purse of money, has
heard of the owner, and is gone to
take it to him. The family talk a great
deal about his probable reward, mak
ing all sorts of extravagant guesses.
Soon Tom returns, and when they ask
him what he has received from the
gentleman who lost his purse he an
swers, "A penny â one whole' penny."
He is much disappointed and disgust
ed till one of his brothers suggests
that he can buy a penny-worth of nuts,
and then they can crack a few Jokes
over the "penny gentleman."
Scene II, "Tent."â A soldier's tent,
with an officer sitting inside, having
his breakfast; two or three soldiers
pass near the tent and there is a
sound of bugles. An orderly comes up
and cries: "Then they must strike the
tent at once. Bring some of the men
to do it." The orderly goes away and
comes back with a number of soldiers,
who proceed to strike the tent, the
officer giving them various directions
as to the tent. While they are fuss
ing about It, pulling at ropes and tak
ing out pegs, the curtain falls.
Scene III (whole word), "Penitent'
âA confessional. The priest'. Invis
ible Inside, the penitent kneeling out
side, sobbing and confessing. Sha
tells how she has decived her father
and mother and run away from home
with a man they disapproved of; but .
that she is now very penitent for her '
fault. The priest tells her that If In
deed she is penitent she will go back
to her father and mother and ask
their forgiveness and beg them to re
ceive her and her husband.
Some of the familiar fairy tales are
very siiccessful for children's parties,
acted in the same way as the more
classical scenes represented by the
"grown-ups," but with less elaborate
preparations. The story of the threa
bears excites wild merriment, and is
pretty generally recognized by all the
little guests. This, in the case of
children's parties, is rather desirable
than otherwise, as then no one is dis
appointed when the prizes are given
away. For thi3 little play the stags
ia arranged with three little heaps of
rugs in the background to represent
the bears* three beds; in the fore
ground are set three chairs of differ
ent sizes round a table laid with the
"biff plate," the "middle-sized plate"
and the "tiny little plate." The four
parts are acted by four children â one
little girl dressed in an ordinary pretty
frock, and three little boys of different
sizes for the three bears. They wear
masks like bears* heads and gray,
hairy dresses in the shape of combin
ations, that can either be hired from
a costumer or made at home. The
parts are much better spoken as well
as acted, but if the children are shy
they may be acted In dumb show. The
little girl comes in first and goes round
and sits in each of the three chairs in
turn; tastes the three plates of por
ridge on the table, and finally goes up
the stage and tries each of the three
beds, ending by falling asleep on one
of them. The screams of delight
which greet the entrance of the bear*
returning from their morning stroll
testify to the appreciation cf the
youthful audience.
"All that glitters is not gold." etc.
The apparition of the ghosts between
the tents of Richard III and Richmond
on the night before the battle of Bos-
I worth made an eerie and effective spec
tacle. It requires a large stage and
some skill in the management of lights
to produce a successful Illusion. The
stage was 60 arranged that only half of
each of the tents was visible, with the
, two occupantsâ Richard III and Rich
mond â asleep within them, the space
between being open for the apparition
' of the ghosts. First the ghost of Prince
Edward, son of Henry VI, rises be
tween the tents; then the ghoet of
Henry VI himself, followed by Clar
ence, the two young Princes killed in
the Tower, Queen Anne and others. To
produce the illusion of the apparition
the stage has to be completely dark
ened while the ghost takes his place be
tween the two tents, then a gradually
increasing light is thrown from the side
"Plaintiff" is a .very good word for
charades, and can be acted in several
ways.
Scene I, "Plain."â Servants suspect
ed of giving away food to their, friends
or to beggars. Cold Joints of meat,
eggs, mince pies, etc., | disappear mys
teriously. The master and mistress
have up the servants to the * sittipg
room In turn, and question them as to
the existence of an unusual number of
rats and mice In the larder or pantry,
and if they can give any dew to the
disappearance of the enumerated arti
cles. The cook talks a good deal about
being a good plain cook, and boasts of
having lived in high families as a plain
cook. At last the mistress discovers
that the cook has a friend to see her
rather frequently, and he occasionally
brings a bag with him, which does not
seem quite empty when he leaves. Cook
is closely questioned, and it becomes
"plain, too plain," wheje the missing
articles go. She begins to cry, and
says It Is very plain they all have a
Eplte against her. The mistress tells
her she has nothing else to complain

REAL GHOST STORIES
"We are haunted by a headless nun;
I hoDe she r will not present herself to
you. The house, you know, was, a con-
vent in'the eighteenth century.", These
words Â» in a . letter from : my ; old .friend
Blackett. in vl tine . me for Christmas.
How Ions we* delved I know not. We
made some work for masons. All at
once I cried:
"The spade is being pulled from me!"
The next Instant I smote something
hard.
We drew out the little box from be
neath the hearth, air-tight seemingly.
The box had a glass lid, and we beheld
within It the exquisite head of a girl
of one or two and twenty. But the very
moment I raiaed the lid that beauty
melted into powder â Uke the down
blown from a thistle.
"The nun has gone too!" whispered
Mn. Blackett, glancing over her
shoulder. M8& UsSf
Mrs. Blackett. her back to tha ghostly
nun, said in a tone which blended relief
with agitation: "Yes, I know that siv?
is there. She was sitting with me on
the sofa, and has Just moved across to
the place where she always stands.
George will believe now!"
George, indeed, looked somewhat un
nerved, though to him it must have
seemed that his wife's gaze and mine
were bent on vacancy.
"Speak to her, Mrs. Graham!" Mrs.
Blackett said to me.
"It is useless. But I know what this
poor penitent craves. It is the head
that w^as cut from her shoulders; and,
what is more, the head is buried close
to where she stands."
"Dreadful!" from Mrs. Blackett.
"Remember," said I, in a tonÂ©' as
matter-of-fact as I could summon,
"that we are in the presence of a trag
edy which may be 150 or 200 years old.
There is nothing here to harm any
one."
"But what do you propose to do?"
asked Blackett, who, albeit shaken, dis
played still a certain dubiety of man
ner.
"To do? To find the little sister b*Â»r
head!" I answered. "If we find It. r>Â»
sure that you will never see her again."
T next morning, taking the farmer
and *we wife In some part into our con
fidence, we made them accompany us
to the haunted room. The rose was still
there, every petal in tact. ' The ; : board
was raised with scarcely an effort by
the farmer and myself, and In a square
cavity beneath stood a small oaken
chest with metal clamps. We opened it
and found, heaped about a small and
elegant guitar, a mass of girlish trink
ets in antique settings and a long silken
purse stuffed with gold pieces.
It pleased Lydia to think that the
gentle ghost of some gentle damsel had
come in this way to the aid of the
farmer and his wife, who were indeed
in very sore straits. The gentle ghost,
its kindly end achieved, slept peace
fully; ; the haunted room was still
thenceforth.
She went straight to the i haunted
room, and as I held the light above her
head in the doorway we saw in the far
corner of the chamber the rose that had
melted under our gaze in the abbot's
parlor. As we stood,, and looked three
distinct knocks resounded from the
board on which the rose lay.
as we were mounting to the room we
had chosen, L'ydla said: "I am being
drawn and guided somewhere. Come
with me." - Â¦ v *
"May we see the rooms?"
We were taken to view s n me fine,
airy chambers on the first floor. "And
the upper floor?" said Lydia, Reluct
antly, the girl led us higher. On the
threshold of a room at one end of the
corridor Lydia paused and said: "This
is the haunted room." Our conductress,
crimsoning, answered astonishedly:
"Yes, madam." She added: "The place
was an abbey once, and after that a
manor house. There Is a story about
the manor house, but we do not know
It."
"Well?" said L
"We will stay here to-night," an
swered Lydia.
So It was that we found ourselves at
supper, Lydia and I, In . the abbot's
parlor, which had been later my lady's
boudoir, and was now a very simple,
low-roofed chamber, with a chintz
covered settle under the trelllaed win
dow, where roses hungr. On* of these
roses Lydia had plucked and fastened
in her dress.
Our homely cloth was removed by the
handsome girl and we were again alone.
A sudden, startled exclamation drew
my eyes to Lydia. The rose in the
bosom of her dress was being slowly
detached by hands Invisible. The same
imperceptible doer carried the flower
before our eyes to about the middle
of the room; there it hung a moment in
the airâ and vanished. It had not fall
en to the floor, nor had the petals dis
solved; the rose simply went out In
epace, as It were, we watching.
Lydia stood up. "I think," she said,
quietly, "it was some one who wanted
me to follow. This Is a, very gentle
ghost"
But there was nothing more until we
went upstairs for the night. Then,
The handsome girl who had let us in
teemed scarcely to have caught the
words, but Ehe looked a little doubtful
ly at both of us, without speaking.
"Tell me." asked Lydia of her, "Is
not your house haunted?"
The handsome girl hesitated.
"I am not at all afraid of srhosts,"
urged Lydia.
'There are noises in the upper rooms,
madam," answered the girL "We never
use them."
We were admitted to the hall, and al
most immediately Lydia, turning to
me. said in a half-whisper: "This place
is haunted."
The tenant of the farm had adver
tised rooms to letâ the object of our
quest. A little red-cheeked girl, riding
pillion on a donkey, with panniers
elung In front of her, pointed us to the
park, beyond which lay the farm
house, an abbey once. Evening was
coming on â a dusky, warm September
eveningâ and, as all the neighborhood
was strange to us, we imagined we
were pilgrims seeking the abbot's hos
pitality, Lydia and L
ComlnK near, I saw the remains of
the cloister, and it was not too difficult
to raise uo in fancy the divers build
ings that trust anciently have stood
within the walls: the abbot's own
lodging, the great refectory, the al
morry, the buttery, the brewhouse and
bakehouse, etc. But most of these had
quite vanished, and what remained
had been converted to the uses of a
modern farmhouse.
We left the station, and asked our
way to the farm, Lydia and L The
cottages cf the village, beautifully
thatched, were scattered irregularly:
the place had an ancient and happy
air.
TBere stood the ghost in her nun's
habit as she lived and died, headless,
her hands folded on her boaom.
"Look where she stands!" I said, as
Blackett threw open the door.
;I was absolutely certain that in the
drawing-room I should see the head
less nun standing to the right of the
mantelpiece.
" "Her head, presumably." And It was
some sort of admonition, a kind of
whisper in the middle of my own head,
. that prompted me to say it.
"We haven't got it, you know," ob
served Blackett. 4
"I wonder' how the poor lady came
to part with it? Saints above! I should
not like to have to account for all the
tragedies of convents. There are peo
ple, certain sensitives, who will take
in their hands a piece of ancient wood
or a fragment of old stone and read
yqn off the history of persons con
nected with that relic centuries back
In the , world. Was there some Hamlet
in this story, who drove this poor nun
to her nunnery, and was responsible
for her cruel death?" \~
"I am afraid," observed Blackett,
"we cannot gratify you with her his
tory. It passed with the convent."
â¢'Let us go to the drawlng'-room."
"You never will," he returned. "As
a good nun, she keeps from men. She
has shown herself to no one except my
wife and daughter, and- it Is only In
the drawing-room she appears."
''Does she communicate?"
"She is headless, . you know. We
don't expect her to talk. She does not
even carry her head under her arm,
like St. Denis. She simply stands to
the right of the mantelpiece with her
arms crossed on her breast."
"Well," said I, "the ghost never yet
walked that had not some errand to
fulfill. This nun wants something, and
appeals to your wife and daughter."
"What should she want?"
pricked in me that curiosity which ever
goes out to *he things that pass my
understanding.
"I have not. seen her yet," I said,
sitting with Blackett over the dining
room fire on the second evening of my
visit.

CHARLES ROARK.
WHAT I WOULD DO IF I HAD TEN DOLLARS?
29As- the season when the Nativity oc
curred was so uncertain, it naturally
follows that many . of the popular ideas
about the birth of Christ are erroneous,
due not a little, no doubt, to the fact
that the numerous painters of the Na
tivity have each sought to depicture the
scene as though it had occurred in their
country under, conditions that prevail
in December in the various parts of Eu
rope ; at that Eeason of the year. Thus
we I have \ pictures ."of " the !: Holy Family
under a shed . that , looks not unlike a
California" co wbarn, r open on all sides ;
we have pictures of a stable set up
against the side of a hill, and, if it is a
northern artist, we have almost invari
ably snow on the roof, oblivious of the
fact that there Is no snow in . Palestine,
Â¦ and ' that winter ; is the â¢ rainy season
there;;" indeed, one .of the chief argu
ments advanced against the date of De-
which Christ was born. In tha East
January ,6 seems to have been the
most_ popular date, , but in different
place's and according to different au
thorities, Christmas has been celebra
ted in every month in the year; in July
and August as well as January, March
and December, and even In the same
month it was celebrated on different
days, and, indeed, as late as 1644 the
English Parliament abolished tha
Christmas festival, declaring that.it
was well known that Christ was born,
not in December, but in September or
October.'
The facts are that when Joseph and
Mary arrived at Bethlehem they found
the inn so crowded .that they could get
no accommodations, and as they must
have been. very poor they wandered out
to the suburbs, of the town looking for
a place to pass the " night. They : saw v
the stable and, probably attracted by
the hay and straw, went In to pass the
night; the' manger was hewn out of
the solid rock, and as It, presumably,
was filled with hay when: the child .was
born It was naturally laid there, aa the
most { convenient 'crib, by ,tho mother.
The only ( occupants of the stable be
sides Joseph and Mary were an ox and
an ass, or as we would say in Califor
nia, a burro; and It .was for years an
English superstition that all over" the
world oxen and. asses" went on . their
knees = at midnight Christmas.
To-day the site of -the stable is oc
cupied by a magnificent church erected
by the Empress Helena, the mother of
the ; Emperor Constantlne.' The "church
is in the shape of a cross.. The "nave .Is
ornamented ". by forty-eight â¢ columns,
each eighteen feet high. The roof was

son and it is not llkerjrjthat the shep

their flocks In the rain, or that the au
thorities would have. selected such .an
unfavorable time of the year to oblige
the people to travel to the places of en
rollment.
Nazareth, into Judea to the city of
David, which is called Bethlehem, be
cause he was of the house and family
of David, to be enrolled with Mary, his
espoused wife, who was -with child."
That, apparently, is clear enough, if
the date of a census ordered by Augus
tus and taken Cyrenius can be ascer
tained; but unfortunately there , were
three censuses ordered by the Emperor,
the data for which from Syria" was pre
pared and collected by Cyrenius.
Naturally, the first Christians con
tinued to fix their â dates, as they had
been accustomed to do before the birth
of Christ, counting, if Jews, from the
Creation; if Romans, from the found
ing of their city; If Greeks by Olym
piads, and for five centuries there were
no Annos Domini; then Dionysis Exi
guus, a Roman abbot. Invented the
present style and by. an elaborate^ sys
tem of calculation placed the birth of
Christ in the ,year 764 of Rome and
the fourth year of the 194th Olympiad,
1903 years ago.'
Dionysis reached his conclusion by
fixing the data of the crucifixion, . and
counting back r thirty- three years, that
being the age of ; Christ, but; subse
quent ; commentators have shown that
he made an error of some four years
and that ' he should : have . begun the
Christian era that much sooner.
> But the -; question as - to , the", exact
year Â¦? was trifling "compared to the
question of the month and day upon
MOST of the good people who
will go to church on Christ
mas day would tell you, if
you asked them, that they
were celebrating the 1903d anniversary
of the birth of Christ, yet the facts are
that they are undoubtedly several
years wrong in the number of years
they suppose to have elapsed since
the advent of the Redeemer, and are
probaBly no more accurate when they
suppose him to have been born on De
cember 25.
Prom the best and most authoritative
sources it seems likely that Christ was
really born in the year B. C. 5, and that
dating the Christian era from the first
day of the following January this
should be the year 1907 Anno Domini,
and not the year 1903.
Both profane and sacred history* tell
us that the Emperor Augustus ordered
a census of . the Roman Empire, and
that for the purpose of enrollment all
the inhabitants were directed to go to
the~dty or town to which they or their
families belonged. That is why Joseph
and Mary went to Bethlehem, and why
that little village. Instead of Nazareth,
was the birthplace of Christ. For the
Bible says (Luke " II, 1-4): "A decree
went forth from Augustus Caesar that
the whole world should be enrolled.
And all went to be enrolled, every one
Into his own city. And Joseph . also
went up from Galilee, from the city of

Into bullets; lately, however. It haÂ«
been replaced. Owing to the endless
warring of the Greek and Latin Christ
ians over the holy places of Palestine
all the principal churches are divided
between them, the Church of tha Na
tivity among the rest. The Armenian
Catholics, who are united to tha Roman
church, have the nave, while the Greeks
control the arms and upper part of the
cross or choir, a wall separating the
nave from the rest of the church. In
the sanctuary or choir is an altar dedi
cated to the s wise kings or magi, and
right in front of it ia a large marble
star set in. the floor. It ia a tradition
that the star of Bethlehem stopped over
this point; at any rate the birth of
Christ took place directly under it In
the grotto below, which is the stable
where Joseph and Mary sought shelter.
You descend in the grotto down fif
teen steps by a spiral staircase. The
stable is thirty-seven and a half feet
long by eleven wide and nine high. It
is hewn out of solid rock and its sides
are covered with costly marble." There
is no natural light, but the place is
lumlnated by thirty-two lamps of won
derful design, presents from various
European Princes. The lamps are kept
continually burning.
' At the farther end of the grotto, on
the east side, is the place of the birth
of the Savior, marked by a marble slab.
DISPUTED QUESTION OF EXACT DAY OF SAVIOR'S BIRTH
in the hurry of the mid-day maal may
not notice that you are buttering great
slices of bread every time you want a
piece.
That Isn't considered nice these day*.
If you haven't a small plate that serves
both for bread and butter, take the
bread and break it into bits with one
hand. Not like the small boy whose
mother told him it wasn't nice to but
ter a whole ellce, but a little piece at
a time. He thought the proposition
over carefully and planned to surprise
her at dinner. When she was busy
serving vegetables, he took a piece of
bread, laid it on the table and care
fully cut it into squares, about sixteen.
Then he buttered each one and lined
them up in a straight row and leaned
back, perfectly satisfied with his work.
It goes without . saying that ha sur
prised his mother, but don't plan to do
like wine. That Is even worse- than but
tering tha slice. Break off a bit when
you want it, but don't crumble into
small pieces, for that *ivÂ«s the table
an untidy appearance.
If I were a small bey or Â«lrl I
should feel positively Insulted to have
Watch your knife and fork with all
your eyes, for ft is so easy to grasp
hold of the handle too far down if the

ond or two down gores your head and
out fly your arms and you look for all
the world as though you were intent
on killing snakes instead of cutting
meat
Probably at some time or other you
have seen laborers eating in a great
hurry. They pile up a quantity of meat
and potato on a thin fork, place it di
rectly in front of their mcuths and
then let their arms shoot forward like
a ramrod out of a gun. Pleasant, clean
ly table manners add a great deal to tho
enjoyment of a meal among people of
refinement, and to many the lack of It Is
infinitely worse than badly cooked or
badly served food. '

business of getting homo from play
a little late; it takes twice as leas tÂ«

after you are seated you won't feel a*>
though the cat had your tongue and 4

You know, or at least you oujfct te
if you don't, that since the year one the
dally meals, eaten in company with
others, have been social as. well as gas
tronomic functions and that no matter
how busy you may be yoi will always
have to find time to eat, and tha sooner
you learn how to do it nicely without
awkwardness or embarrassment the
better for you, for let me tell you right
here that nothing is more difficult to
uproot when you are grown than little
careless habits formed at tha table In
babyhood.
Of course, everywhere you go you are
bound to find some boys and girls that
are greedy, but even If you are espe
cially fond of icecream or plum pudding
don't look at your neighbor's dish with
-envious eves to see if by any hook or
crook she has more than you have,
That Is so ill-mannered. And Just re
member one little thing about It: Prob
ably your eyes are a great deal bigger
than your stomach, and even if you
had been given more you couldn't have
gotten away with It.
Don't be In too much of a hurry to
get to the Christmas tree. Always take
plenty ot time to -?. for when you
are invited out to dine- you are not ex
pected to bolt your food and run- Be-_f
tween courses sit back leTiurely as yot^
think the President of the United
States might: and, by the wav If you
try to pattern after the first lady and
first gentleman in the land you -can't
go far wrong, and for all you know
you mieht be called upon to take bis
or her place some *".y.
A napkin spread orer &â¢ eleth at my
place. It U entirely teo suggestive of
the small mnimai* m the bade yard
that eat from a trough and I'd
straightway show tha family that ha
was no friend er even a passing ac
quaintance of mine. And ifs the same
with the bib. Yes. It's all very well
and good to declare that you don't
wear a bib and haven't used one for
the past three years, but pray tell
what Is the napkin that finds Its way
around your neck so often, especially
when yon have your best 8unday-go
to-meetlng clothes en? It looks
strangely Ilka a bib to the uninitiated.
There Isn't any rhyme or reason for
It so far as I can sea. for you most
certainly aren't a baby and 1*11 war
rant tan to ona you'd be madder thin
a wet hen at the mere idea and be
willing to fight it out In the back
yard.
If you were Invited te a CSurtrtma*

that you couldn't aat nor Bleep, just

Of course, if you are going ot sidle
Into the room, hang your head and
scrape your toes into the rugs, she'll
be more than likely to think* you grew
on a tree in the hills, but if you run
'downstairs and very frankly shake
bands with her she'll probably think to
herself: "What a manly chap Tom is.
I'd like George to be like him," and
then you just see if there aren't good
times coming.
Of cpurse. after that if you hold your
elbows out and flourish, your arms
around like windmills she'll change her
mind, and she most certainly ought to,
for there isn't one thing that looks
quite as commonplace or as careless.
Don't lounge in your chair either. Sit
up. for you aren't a Turk, and conse
quently there isn't the least shadow of
an excuse for lying down. Besides the
meal never is long enough to tire you
out completely.
Every one can tell a little lafly or
Â¦rentlexnan as far as they can see them,
but there Isn't any one place that
marks them as distinctly as at the
table. If you don't believe It Just
watch yourself.
True, it isn't much fun being
dragged from the highest limb in the
cherry tree to luncheon, particularly
when there are guests, but as long as
It has to be done, it's a rattling good
scheme to do it as cheerfuly and
Quickly as possible. You see that
means the trying ordeal will be over
Just that much sooner and may be
you can beat Johnny and get the best
â¢eat after all.
There's one thing that should al
ways be done*before you present your
self at the table. Climbing trees and
shlnnying over back fences somehow
or other doesn't seem to make your
hands especially clean of your blouse,
either, for that matter. So run right
along to your own room and have an
animated cleaning-up bee. Ifs an
awful nuisance. I know, but suppos
ing Mrs. Guest should take a fancy to
you "and tnvite you to the theater on
Saturday with her own 'children,
wouldn't that be fine and daisy?
Haven't you seen the boy or girl
that never can be quiet a single mo
ment? Xot one? Well, I have, and I
positively heard one chap's father
offer him 60 cents if he would sit
on a chair and not move for five
minutes. Of course, he didn't win it,
for he was eternally and forever into
everything, and he couldn't help wrig
gling to save his life.
That may sound awfully easy to you,
and it might be if you were ever in
the habit of reading or even playing
doll, but if you spend your time fall
ing up and down the stairs and try
ing to see how much noise and dis
turbance you can create, I am awfully
alraid you could not win the 50 cents
either.
But I do mean to behave yourself
in such a fashion that your neighbor*
won't feel sorry to see you coming.
Don't be such a nuisance. They're
too trying for anything, and besides
you can't imagine how much fun it
bars you from.
And wouldn't you be ashamed and
wouldn't your mother feel hurt if you
could look into your friend's home
and watch" her rushing about picking
up dainty roses costly bric-a-brac
before she answered the bell. And
the uncomfortable part of it is she
wouldn't do it unless you had handled
everything in sight and kept her con
stantly in hot water for fear you
might break her pretty things.

The mii^ger cast the characters well, and he got such hearty praise
That he vrlll be a hero great to the end of his earthly days.
Grardpa Prune was manager, with Shakespeare Plum as aid.
And both worked just as hzzi as though they'd been most liberally paid.
The part cf Uncle Tom was played by Dill Pickle, sedate and sour, '
And all the critics said he was quite the lien of the hour.
Pat Potato tock the part of little Eva dear,
And when he tripped before the crowd he got a mighty cheer.
He was lovely in his pinafore and ribbons bright and gay,
And his voice was quite as mellcw as the sun of a burning day.
When he sat en the knee cf Uncle Tom end heard tic wondrous story
The critics said he tras Â£ t the height of bis well-earned glory.
The part cf prying Lawyer Marks, who bid the sale of slaves.
Was taken by Mr. Crookneck Squash; who brought to time the knaves.
Crcokreck was very funny as he tripped about the stage.
The part of heartless Simon Legree was played by Pippin green,
And when he whipped poor Uncle Tom he was hissed for being mean.
The sweet and lovable Nellis Pearl, in a dress all tattered and torn.
Took the part of poor Eliza, who was of all gappiness shorn.
When she crossed the river of tumbling ice, pursued by hungry hounds,
Jhe tadleocÂ© yefletl "Wcoctren.TJarfl i2pr tcfl wished her safer
grounds.
OH Onion played young Harris, tad he ably filled the part,
Asd Johnny Gherkin was the babeâ the prlds of Eliza's heart.
The most touching scene of all, my dean, was the tableau at the close,
When little Eva left the earth and to the demds arose.
Tears filled almost every eye and voices choked with sadness.
But there was joy when old Legree was punished for his badness.
After the final curtain fell some rascal cut the string
Which heid sweet Eva ia the air â too dear for anything.
"Poor Potato dropped down to the stage and sprained his wrist and knee.
Bat in his rage he jumped about like a squirrel in a nut-fiHed tree.
"Show me the one that cut the string," he roared in threatening tone, .
"And 111 provide a vacant chair in some one's happy homer
His blood was as hot as it could be and fire flashed from his eyes, '
And everybody on the stage was filled with great surprise
Manager Prune said he would give a reward of a dollar or two
For detection of the scamp who put Potato in such a stew.
But after Pat had cooled somewhat all talked about the play .
And decided to give "Hamlet" on some not distant day.

murder, was held to-day under a guard
of Dollce, who were forced to use clubs
to disperse crowds of striking cabmen
CHICAGO, Dec 19.â ThÂ» strike sit
uation provoked rioting at churches
and in the presence of people mourn
ing for dead relatives to-day. Pickets
for the striking livery drivers Invaded
houses of worship and Â«nade It Impos
sible to procure funeral vehicles. Police,
protection was demanded for many
funerals and In one case an actual riot
took place.
Besides tho interference with fun
erals the strike has tied up all private*
ambulances and doctors' vehicles and
great suffering has already resulted.
A. B. Perrigo, who has an ambulance
service, said to-day that pickets havÂ»
surrounded his place and prevented his
answering calls for relief of thosa
needing surgical and medical attention.
MOURNERS WALK TO GRAVES.
WJth nearly seventy-five funerals tÂ»
be held In Chicago to-day there was no
sign of peace between the livery and
hearse drivers and the employers. In
cold, drizzling rain the relatives of
those who were to be buried slippad
along the Ice and slush-covered pave
ments, as In many cases the mourners
followed to railway stations the busi
nesslike "dead" wagons of the under
takers. Walking was treacherous, but
there was practically no. alternative.
No carriages were to be had.
The undertakers announced that they
would not send out any hearses until
the strikers had been forced into sub
mission, for it would be dangerous to
risk the costly carriages out of the
barns, even if non-union men could'
be. had. . k % .

General Elliott has been informed
that unless the Isthmian situation en

phase : in .the meantime he will com

retary has taken active hold in the
shaping of the naval policy on the
isthmus, and. from now on the Instruc

ficers, will be prepared as far as possi
ble at his personal direction. It was
announced to-day that. while the situa

alarming . to the Washington Govern

..warrant the most careful and diplo

VALLEJO, Dec. 19.â To have been a
sailor yesterday in Uncle Sam's navy
at a monthly pay ' of $13. and to find
himself to-day .worth $250,000 is the ex
perience of John Snyder, who was hon
orably-discharged from the naval,ser
vice this afternoon and left for Port
land, Or., to-night.
Snyder's fortune comes from his
father, who left money, bonds and real
estate In Portland, Seattle, New York
and Tampa. Fla., worth $250,000. It is
to look after this valuable property
that the heir, who Is only 23 years old,
has started north.
Snyder has been in the naval service
for four years, and during a. consid
erable portion of that time" he served as
a baker. He arrived at Mare Island
several months ago on the gunboat
Princeton from service In the Philip

GRANTS PASS, Or.', Dec/ 19.â Left
behind by his train at a desolate water
tank stop on .the plains of Idaho, J. A.
Mock, a well-to-do and. aged resident
of, this tcityV wandered off in the dark
ness, got lost and died of starvation.
Â¦Yesterday his son, A. H. Mock of this
city, received a telegram from the divi
sion superintendent of the Oregon Short
Line at Pocatello, Idaho, informing him
that the remains of - his' father, who
mysteriously disappeared several
months ago while en route to Iowa
from here, had been found.
For several months Mock has been
endeavoring to get some trace of his
father. As the old gentleman left here
with considerable money on his person
it was feared that he â¢. had met foul
play. The disappearance of the man
and the', announcement of a reward
were liberally advertised all along the
line of the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation road and the Oregon Short Line,
4>ut no definite Information was - re
ceived till yesterday morning.
From the brief telegram sent here it
appears that Mock got off the train at
a small station or water tank near
Minnidoka, Idaho, during " the night.
The train started suddenly and he was
unable to board the cars.- Left alone,
he probably attempted to find a ranch
er's house or some place to spend the
night. But it is an uninhabited coun
i try, and he wandered* away '. from the
railroad, to become helplessly lost. The
result was his dying of starvation and
exposure. His , money, Â¦' ticket, papers
and* all his personal effects were intact.
if H. Mock left here last night for
Minnidoka to take charge of his father's
remains. They will be taken to Albia,
Iowa, whither the old: gentleman had
started to , settle up. the affairs of his
estate and to make a farewell visit to
his old home.

LONDON, Dec. 19.â The Rothschilds
have heard nothing of any suggestions
that Russia v/ill attempt to raise a
/loan of $125,000,000 or any other amount
In Great Britain, and they declare that
the report Is probably -unfounded.
Russia, they say, could not raise a loan
here, and Judging from their latest ad
vices from Paris it probably would be
equally difficult for- Russia to raise
more money in . Francis. The Dress | Is
informed' from other quarters that even
were a Russian. loan issued elsewhere
there is little likelihood of any ."portion
of it being underwritten in London. :
NEW YORK.vDec.19.~The report .in
circulation to the- effect' that Russia
was about ; to open negotiations ; with a
view to securing a loan in New York
was not credited. , in financial' circles

ago. â¢ 'Â¦ ;...:.;
A few days . ago ' representatives of

the money, if 'secured, might be used
for war purposes. These negotiations
also were unsuccessful., ... # ' C

"Now or Never" is the heading which^
one paper, the St. James Gazette, to r ;
day phits upon its leading article, in,
which It declares that Japan will.strike*
before the Russian squadron now as
sembling at BIzerta can accomplish its
enforcedly leisurely journey to the
scene of action. .
This represents the extremist .view/
for although London, generally speak
ing. Is convinced that war Is the almost
inevitable outcome of the situation,
many good judges, think ; that the peace
will not be broken for some time to
come. .' ,
This same paper claims, to bÂ© able
to confirm, from many Inquiries in of
ficial Quarters, the reports that the
British admiralty is now making pre
parations for the eventuality, of war;
that torpedo ofllcers are undergoing
courses of instruction, at Portsmouth

A London dispatch to the Birming

the express desire that they, should be

said he did not know when it would be
made public, if at all.
"The present Federal administration
is very thoroughly and unsparingly de

ished," said Bonaparte. "This is par
ticularly true of the President. He is
absolutely fearless in this work and
will permit nothing to stop him. Every
charge of official corruption that Presi
dent Roosevelt hears of will be probed
to the bottom. I believe that his earn

These recognitions of the republic
of Panama by the South-Central Amer
ican republics, most of which have held
back until within the last few days,
are expected to have much influence
upon the attitude of Colombia, reveal
ing, as they do, the fee:lng of her sis
ter republics toward propositions to
unite against Panama, such as were
broached by the Paris Colombian rep
resentative yesterday.
General Reyes and Dr. Herran are
still busy with the statement they are
preparing to the State Department
protesting against what is taking place
on the isthmus.
The fact of Peru's recognition of Pan
ama was first- communicated to the
State Department by Dr. Calderon, the
Peruvian Minister. A little Uiier came
a cablegram from Mr. Neill. the United
States Charge d' Affaires at Lima, stat
ing that the Peruvian Government had
appointed a consul to Panama, thereby
recognizing the new Government, as
his credentials were addressed to It.
LIMA, Peru, Dec. 19.â By a decree
dated December 13 the Peruvian Gov

Panama.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19. -When M.
Bunau-Varilla, the Minister from Pan

to-day, Acting Secretary Loomls in
formed him of the receipt of a cable

at Lima, saying that Peru had decided
to recognize the new republic of Pan

nau-Varilla, the Minister from Pan

taining the ratified canal treaty. The
box contained, in addition to the
treaty, duly ratified by the Junta and
bearing . also the signatures of the
Cabinet Ministers, the official decree
of the Government announcing the
ratification of the instrument. The
exchange copy of the treaty will ar
rive by the next steamer from Pan

a vote of the national council decided,

WASHINGTON, Dec. 19. â M. Bu-
a steamship, the small force of Colom
bian troops, which had been discov
ered at the mouth of the Atrato River,
had sailed to the northward on a Co
lombian gunboat. Admiral Glass has
not been able to verify the report.
bian Congress on October 31 was duly
reported by Beaupre on thafdate, with
the comment that nothing had been
done except a vote of rejection of the
treaty of August 12. He reported great
anxiety over conflicting reports of se
cession in the Cauca and Panama de
partments.
On November 24 Beaupre reported the
situation under control, but expressed
alarm as there was intense feeling
against the Government .and also
against the United States ' because of
the belief that the United Slates had
encouraged the secession movement.
Beaupre said an army of 10,000, com
manded by General Reyes, was being
raised to operate against Panama; pro
vided- the United States woiild. allow
Colombia to land troops.
This telegram reported; also a meet
ing at which a resolution was passed
requesting the Government to call a
convention for the. purpose of amend
ing legislation In order to render pos
sible immediate ratification , of the
treaty. It was opposed by the-Govern
ment and General Reyes as being In
opportune. On November 12 Beaupre
telegraphed that ,he â¢ had Invited
to the Cabinet meeting at. the palace
the. night before. He was asked if he
officially construed the telegram of the
6th to mean that the United States
would not permit the landing of Colom
bian troops. Beaupre replied that the
language needed no interpretation and
that he had no explanations to make.
Beaupre said in this telegram that
Mr. Rico declared this recognition con
trary to all precedents. He stcted that
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â President
Roosevelt to-day transmitted to the
House the third installment of papers
relating to the recent revolution on the
isthmus of Panama. The papers com
prise the correspondence between the
State Department and Minister Beau
pre of Bogota relative to the Hay-
Herran treaty, consisting of 120 letters
and telegrams sent between March 18
and November 19, 1903.
On April 7 Secretary Hay telegraphed
Beaupre to notify Colombia that the
matter of the requests of Colombia to
the canal and railroad "companies for
appointments of agents to negotiate
cancellation of the present concessions
was covered by treaty, "and any
I change would be in violation of the
Spooner law and not permissible."
On April 15 Beaupre reviewed at
length the feeling in Colombia toward
the treaty. On Its negotiations h^
says: .,-.."
'"I am convinced, the, public had never
expected* better terms."
-. In- a later communication on the
subject of adverse public Opinion to
ward the treaty. Mr.'., Beaupre said:
"It is utterly impossible to convince
, these people that the Nicaragua route
i was ever seriously considered by the
United States: that the negotiations
concerning" it Â¦ had any other motive
than the squeezing of an advantageous
bargain out of Colombia or that any
other than the. Panama route ever will
â¢be selected." Â¦
The public discussion, he says, was
largely along the line of the loss of
national honor by the surrender of sov
ereignty, while private discussion was
to the effect that the price was inade
quate.
On June 9 Hay sent to Mr. Beaupre
this telegram: . â¢ _
"The Colombian Government appar
ently does not appreciate the gravity
of the situation. The canal negotia
tions were initiated by Colombia and
were, energetically pressed on this Gov
ernment for 'several years. The propo
sitions' presented by Colombia, with
slight modifications, were finally ac
cepted by us. In view of this agree
ment, our Congress reversed its pre
vious judgment and decided upon the
Panama route. If Colombia should
now reject the treaty or unduly delay
its ratification the friendly understand
ing between the two countries would
be so serio-usly compromised that ac
tion mizht be taken by the Congress
next winter which every friend of Co
lombia would regret."
On July 5- Mr. Beaupre sent the fol
lowing confidential telegram to Secre
tary Hay:
"Have received Information privately
that a paraphrase of your cipher tele
gram on June 9 was received in the
Senate secret session. Created Bensa
tion. Construed by many as a threat of
direct retaliation against Colombia in
case treaty is not ratified. This and the
statement of Just arrived members of
Congress from Panama that this de
partment wou!d revolt If the treaty Is
not ratified caused alarm, and the ef
fect is favorable." -
Under date of September 10 Beaupre
cabled the following:
Â¦ "Fierce attack to-day in. the Senate
upon the appointment, of Obaldla as
Governor of Panama. The appointment
is regarded as being the forerunner of
separation. Of several Senators who
spoke only the son of the President de
fended the action of the Government.
A resolution, passed by almost unanim
ous vote which is equivalent to a vote
of censure against the Government."
In a letter which followed this cable
message Beaupre commented on the
"separatist" tendencies of the newly
appointed Governor of Panama, which
he said were well known.
"He is reported to have said." the
letter continues, "that should the canal
treaty not pass the department 6f Pan
ama would declare its Independence,
and would be right in doing so. That
these are. his opinions there is, of
course, no doubt."
Under date of October 21 Beaupre
communicated a positive feeling of
alarm in Bogota over the possible ac
tion of the United IStates 'should the
feeling in Panama find, expression: in
overt acts. This alarm, he said, was
voiced In the Senate,on:the day pre
vious. . On October 22 Secretary Hay
cabled Beaupre: , .
; "If you find disposition on the part of
Colombia to ask terms more favorable
to Colombia than those heretofore-ne
gotiated you may; Intimate. orally, but
not in writing, that'it will be useless
to send a special envoy."

President Sends to the House Further

HAY-BEAUPKE CABLEGRAMS.
NEW YORK, Dec. 19.â The new Wil
liamsburg bridge, the second and
greater bridge across the East Riverr
connecting the boroughs of Manhattan
and Brooklyn, was turned over to the
city and formally opened to-day, the
dedicatory exercises including military
parades from both sides of the river
and the meeting in the center of the
new bridge of Mayor -Low and the
Manhattan borough officials with Presi
dent Swanstrom and other Brooklyn
borough officials, speeches on the plaza
at the Brooklyn end of the bridge and
a dinner in the Hanover Club, Brook
lyn. This was followed this evening
by a irreat water demonstration and
naval parade and a magnificent display
of fireworks from the bridge.
The new . bridge, construction on
which was begun October 28, 1896, is
about a mile above the Brooklyn bridge,
which it greatly resembles in type and
appearance, though much larger. Its
length between terminals is 7200 feet,
its width 118 feet, the Brooklyn bridge
being but eighty-five feet wide. The
bridge proper cost about 511,000,000 and
the condemning of land for approaches
brought the total cost up to about
$21,000,000.

A potent factor in the shaping of the
naval policy on the isthmus will be the
health of the marines. Care will be
taken In the selection of camps and
every possible precaution' against trop
ical illness will be observed. Some of
the towns in which the marines prob
ably will be stationed are Empire,
Georgina and Pcrrto Bello.
Captain Harry Leonard, assistant aid
to the commandant of the Marine
Corps, who lost his arm in the march
to Peking and was advanced for con
spicuous bravery, has asked to be or
dered to the isthmus. The request is
now under consideration by Secretary
Moody. Other officers of the Marine
Corps have applied for similar orders.
However, thus far, Captain Evans, aid
de came to the commandant, is the
only officer, except General Elliott, who
has been definitely, selected.
There are several vacancies among
the officers in the marine force on the
isthmus, which will be filled in a few
days, the reliefs going on the Dixie
with General Elliott.
In official circles to-night it was
stated that Panama, while disclaiming
any obligation to Colombia for a pay
ment of a portion of her debt, will vol
untarily and as an act of comity as
sume such share of it as, in her judg
ment, may be deemed necessary. It is
expected that the formal expressions
of the Government on the subject Is
only delayed pending the statement of
General Reyes, the desire being to note
what demands Colombia wishes to
make.
lutely demands it. It is believed a
more effective scheme will bo to dis
tribute the three battalions among the
towns and villages of Panama other
than the cities of Panama and Colon,
leaving to the navy the protection of
these terminals: It Is possible that
some marines will be encamped on the
high lands in the vicinity" of the border
line, but General Elliott must determine
this after his arrival on the isthmus.

DO NOT WEARA'lyOXG FACE.
It Is a Great Handicap in Alty Busi-
*" ness and Social Relations.'
The man who looks as if he had lost
his last friend is In no danger of being
crushed by the jam of new ones un-
less he "cheers up." People are not
going out of their : way. nowadays to
associate with the man of mournful and
melancholy appearance. They are
afraid he will tell them his troubles
and they steer clear of him, as they all
have plenty of their own.
The most universal cause of the for-
lorn and hopeless appearance to-day is
dyspepsia. It unfits a man for every
duty of life and causes him to* become
despondent and gloomy and necessarily
his looks do not belie his feelings. He
appears cast down and dejected *and
becomes a burden to himself and hu-
manity in general.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
dyspeptic's certain relief. "They do the
work that his stomaph is unable to
do and by relieving that organ, of its
'burdens permit it to regain; its health
and strength and again become active
and useful in its functions. -They
tain all the essential; ingredients'. that
enter into the, digestive fluids and se-
cretions of the stomach and -\ they, act-
ually take ud the. work and do it Just
as a healthy, sound stomach would.
By this means" a man can go right
ahead with his -work j and eat enough
to keep him in proper working condi-
tion. His system -Is not deprived of
Its necessary nourishment as it is in
the case of tha "starvation cure" or
the employment of some of the first
class chicken foods now on the market.
Starvation, even if it were a good thing,
could not be continued long enough to
effect a cure: for a -disordered and
worn out stomach' is not going to be-
come strong and healthy in two or
three davs.
Â¦ Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act nat-
urally because they contain natural di-
gestives. The principal component
parts are aseptic pepsin, malt diastase
and other ingredients with like proper-
ties that do the work regardless of the
condition of the stomach. There Is no
unnatural or violent disturbance of the
digestive organs as the. result of their
action. In fact, the existence of the
stomach Is entirely forgotten as soon
as they 'have had time to 'begin their
operations. They also possess very
curative and healing properties and as-
sist the stomach in getting well, while
relieving it of its work. They perform
the duties of both nurse and physician.
'Â¦ Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box
and there : is .very little danger of any
druggist trying to sell you something
else in its place *thatÂ«is V'just as good,"
They are so , well establishedf and have
done so 'much good in the world that
their name has become a household
word; so the usual warning, "Accept
no substitute." Is unnecessary in the
case of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.

ride, thus cutting the force in that dis
trict to 325 men. At the first of the

eral Bell, "the troops will all be with
drawn from the field. The strikes are
practically over. There are 3200 min
ers at work in Cripple Creek, and the
Telluride mines one after another are
being reopened."

tion of the dynamiters who wrecked
five miners' homes at Newcastle on
December 17, "or any one directly con
nected with the perpetration of said
outrage."

NEW YORK, Dec. 19. â William
Becker, 80 years old, an inmate of tin
Odd Fellows' Home at Unionport, has
met his death in an unusual manner.
Although extremely feeble, Becker
was fond of walking and while on one
of his rambles near the edge of West
chester Creek he got into a treacher
ous piece of mud. Like quicksand, it
sucked him down and he was unable
to move. The tide was rising and in
a short time was up to his waist. He
struggled vainly while the water ro3e

NEW YORK, Dec. 19.â An investiga
tion by Receiver Frank L. Crocker Into
the affairs of the James Freeman
Brown Company, cotton jobbers, which
went into voluntary bankruptcy De
cember 8. is said by the receiver to
show assets estimated at $20,000 and
liabilities of about $S0,000. The com
pany's treasurer, Edward ij. Willett,
has not visited his office since Decem
ber 3 and the receiver says he has
asked the surety company which was
on his bond for $10,000 to help him se
cure an interview with Willett. Mem
bers of the latter's family said at his
home in Glenridge, N. J., that he is 111
and In retirement, but that they are in
dally communication with him. The
failed company was capitalized at $200,
000 and is estimated to have been doing
a business of $1,000,000 a year. On Jan
uary 1 last it was said the books could
show assets of $260,000 and liabilities of
only $100,000.^The failure was precipi
tated Decemfftr 8 in the Federal Court,
when a petition was. presented by the
High Shoals Company of High Shoals,
N. C, and the Eddefleld Manufacturing
Company of Eddefleld, S. C, which
claimed $19,400 due for cotton goods. .

Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Trial on the conspiracy and bribery
indictments was set for January 4. As
sistant District Attorney Bush vigor
ously objected to that date and asked
for four weeks in which to prepare the
Governrrient'8 case. This time, how
ever, was reduced to two weeks. Â¦ No
time was set for trying Senator Die
trich on the indictments returned De
cember 17 charging him with profiting
by leasing a building to the Govern
ment.
In setting the date for the trial Judge
Munger said :
'"From an Individual standpoint Sen
ator Dietrich is not entitled to certain
considerations, but from the fact of
his position as an officer of the Gov
ernment, whose seat in the United
States Senate is made vacant because
of this matter, he is entitled to an early
hearing in order that he may resume
his official duties."
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 19.â United
States Senator Charles H. Dietrich, ac
companied by General John C. Cowen,
his attorney, appeared before Judge
Munger in the United States Circuit
Court to-day and was arraigned on
the indictments returned against him
November 10 and December 17. To the
indictment charging him with profiting
by leasing a postoffice building to the
Government Senator, Dietrich pleaded
not guilty, and to that charging him
with conspiracy and bribery he refused
to plead. In the latter counts,, which
were those returned November 17, in
which he Is charged jointly with Post
master Jacob Fisher of Hastings with
conspiracy and bribery in connection
with Fisher's appointment, General
Cowen informed the court that the de
fendant would attaclc the sufficiency of
the indictment.

BERLIN, Dec. 19. â The Saxon Gov
ernment has forbidden the holding of
several great Christmas parties at
Crimmltzschau by the strikers belong
ing to the textile trades on the ground
that they would be seditious gather
ings tending to disturb the. public
peace. A feeling of intense bitterness
is the result. These parties were to
be paid out of the strike funds <so
that no strikers should be without a
Christmas celebration. The National
Society of Textile Workers, however,
has arranged to give a present to
every child.
The streets of Crimmitzsch.au are
now patrolled by gendarmes, whose
orders are to not permit more, than
two men to be together In the streets.
Nearly the whole body of strikers,
between seven and eight' thousand,
marched over the frontier into the
territory of Altenburg a few days ago
to hold meetings out of the reach of
the Saxon Government and discuss
the situation. They are determined
to persist in the strike, which has now
lasted eighteen, weeks.

I send my message of love and peace
and hope and help. Unbelievers may

"No 2Xan la Lost â There Is a Sore Cure
lor Every Weak Man." â DÂ« Ferris.
It is mine to give to whom I will and
my works go before me. Doubt not!
I ask no man to believe me, but I give
j to every weak man free this priceless
boon and it restores him instantly to
the strength and powerful vigor of
â¢youth. With this marvelous, mysterious
compound, which I have discovered
only after a lifetime devoted to search
I through all the realms of science, and
I the archives of the ancients, it is possi-
ble for every weak man to have for his
own the glorious manly power, the un-
tiring vigor and the long life of the
j patriarchs of Bible times. With this
j mysterious compound no weak man
i will ever again be troubled with impa-
1 tency, vital losses, nightly emissions,
i spermatorrhea, varicocele, prematur-
j Ity, defective power or lack of vital
I energy.
; Send me no money. It Is my duty,
I guided by an Unseen Hand â It Is my
mission on earthâ my life workâ to lift
up the fallen, heal the weak and cure
the maimed or undeveloped; and to ev-
try man who has lost his vital power
or finds It -.vaning. I send my message
of love and Dtace and health. I ca.n
save him and I will save him and re-
store him to many years of happiness
and the Impetuous vitality and vigor-
ous manhood of perfect health and
youth. â¢
Remember, it matters not how old
you are; it matters not how you lost
your manhood, or when you lost It. It
j matters not what doctors or scoffers
say. This Js ho ordinary drug or stim-
ulating method of treatment, but it is
the vital spark of life itself, and it
matters rot how many remedies and
doctors have failed, I have repeatedly
and instantly renewed the .youth of old
men. My secret compound never tills.
I have often instilled into jaded men
new vitality, health and strength. For
worn-out men I have oft kindled, In an
instant, and to stay, the sparkling vi-
tality of youth. "Write to me to-day
and tell me in strictest confidence all
about your case. My private address
is Dr. C. Sargent Ferris, 3GS Strawn
.building, Cleveland," Ohio, and I urge
every weak man to come to me, for I
will give him undying strength, the su-
preme joj r and happiness of perfeol
manliness. My wondrous discovery has.
startled the world by its miraculous ef-
fects, yet I- seek notiame nor glory. It
suffices me if I may be the humble In-
strument of Nature's greatest power In
bringing all men into the enjoyment of
their true manliness and I do it free.
In the time allotted to me here on
earth I shall do all that in my power
lies to give my fellow men the benefit of
this great secret and my reward shall
be in the knowledge that I have done
unto others as I would that others
should do uoto me. - tr ->

Osgood. r.ho was a traveling man.
â¢^ as arrested by his first wife some few
months after his second marriage on
a. charge of bigamy. He was married
io his first wife some ten years ago.
He was sentenced to two years In San
Quentln prison and served his term.
Aft^r he left the State prison Osgood
went East and his present whereabouts
is unknown.
Osgood's first wife was Nellie J. Kln-
Fflla and 6he prosecuted him for blg
nmy. His second wife was a Miss
"vTinn, and while Osgood was courting
her he represented himself to her as a
single man.
Robinson & Getz. attorneys for Os
good's seccTd wife, who Is now suing
for annulment of her marriage, say
that Osgood has a mania for marry
ir.g and that the latest reports of him
from the Kast are that he has led a
number of women to the altar since
his release from San Quentin prison.
Dr. John A. Fritz, the physician who |
claims to have been hypnotized by the
woman he married ten days after his
first wife, Mary Agnes Fritz, secured j
a divorce from him on the ground of j
cruelty, finds that he does not like the |
position of a male Trilby and wants a j
divorce. He has filed a suit for divorce,
charging his present wife, Jennie, with
cruelty and Infidelity. In connection j
with the last charge he says that she
has been consorting with one Frank
Vorce of S28 Alabama street. In sup
port of his charee of cruelty he says
that Mrs. Fritz No. 2 led him a merry
dance from the very day she became
his wife. He alleges that Just as soon
as she became Mrs. Fritz, or. In other '
words, had him properly Svengalized,
he commenced to suffer. She called I
him all sorts of names end abused him
roundly in the presence of his patients
r.nd on two occasions visited his office
and wrecked the place.
If the complaint contains a list of
all of Mrs. Fritz's alleged acts of cruel- i
ty, she d!d not treat him nearly as bad |
iis the court found Fritz treated his \
first wife. In the decree that the first j
Mrs. Fritz secured in Judge Troutt's I
court last April the court finds that
Fritz cursed and abused Mrs. Fritz and
ihreatened her life with a chair, and
that she had been compelled to seek
police protection from his brutality.
The court also Tound that Fritz had
taken JC60, all his wife's savings, and
gor.e c-ff on a good time, leaving her
and their four children destitute. The
judgment roll in the case also shows
that after Mrs. Fritz had secured a
divorce, the doctor failed to comply
with the court order directing him to
contribute $30 a month toward her sup
port and had been cited to appear be
fore Judge Troutt to show cause why j
he should not be punished for con
tempt of court.

IS IT CURABLE?
A Question Often Asked by Those Af-
flicted With Piles.
Is a strained Joint curable? Is local
Inflammation curable? Of course, if
properly treated. So is pVles.
People often become afflicted with
piles and ask some old "chronic" who
has always persisted in the wrong
treatment, and naturally he discour-
ages them by telling them that their
cas<^ is hopeless.
They in turn discourage others, and
thus a disease that can in every case
be cured by careful and skillful hand-
ling Is 'allowed to sap the energy of
thousands who might free themselves
of thu trouble in a few days.
Pyramid Pile Cure win cure the most
aggravated case of hemorrhoids in an
astonishingly short time. It relieves
the congested parts, reduces the tu-
mors instantly, no matter how large,
allays the inflammation and stops the
aching or itching at once.
Thousands who had resorted to ex-
pensive surgical treatment have been
cured by the Pyramid Pile Cure in a
number of instances persons who had
spent months in a hospital under
a pile specialist.
It is a remedy that none need fear
to apply even to the most aggravated,
swollen and. inflamed hemorrholdal
tumors.
If you are afflicted with this stub-
born disease you can master it and
master it quickly.
This remedy Is no longer an experi-
ment, but a medical certainty, and is
eold by druggists everywhere for 50
cents a package.
"Write Pyramid Drug Company, Mar-
shall. Mich., for their free book on the
cause and cure of piles.

ROME, Dec. 19.â The settlement of
the friars lands question in the Philip
pines also practically settles, it is con
sidered here, the question of the friars
themselves. The Franciscans, it Is be
lieved, will abandon the lands alto
gether, since they have no money to
purchase lands and have no other
means of support." A few of the Recol
lects will, remain, as they, have still
some property there. The Dominicans
will be looked after by their university
and thÂ« Augustinians will reoccupy* the
building erected at IUoilo, which Is now
used by the Americans, as; a barracks,
and will claim an Indemnity from the
Government. The Augustin'ans will
use the b-uilding as a school.
.It is believed that the number of
friars remaining in the Philippines
with the consenvof the new American
Bishops will not exceed 150, but none
will" be 'sent to the archipelago, owing
to the lack of funds. Under the old
regime Spain paid for the transporta
tion of friars to the Philippines.

The news that Grace G. Thorne had
secured a divorce from Andrew
Thorne, the attorney, became known
yesterday. The decree was granted
Saturday, October 3, by Judge Heb
bard on the ground of cruelty, the evi
dence showing that In August of this
year Thorne struck and kicked his
wife and that numerous times since
their marriage he had thrown beer,
Mine and water in her face. The rec
ords in the marriage license office re
veal the fact that the Thornes were
married November 27, 1900, the. age of
the lawyer at that time being 37 and
that of his bride 26. Mrs. Thome's
maiden name was Conroy.
Sarah Arnold is suing Ernest Arnold
for divorce on- the ground of cruelty,
alleging In her complaint that, ever
since their marriage in November,
1901, he has abused her insuch a
shameful manner that her health has
been impaired. She says that last Oc
tober, after abusing her on the public
streets, he left her standing alone in
shame' and humiliation and that last
month he : tore up their marriage li
cense and told her he would fight any
one in the house who attempted to in
terfere with him. She says' further
that in November he compelled her to
pack his trunk, while he stood by and
cursed and abused her. On "November
20, she says, 1 he left her and has not
since returned.
Hattle de Wolf Emerick, who was
married to O. Emerick at Leominster,

Leigh replied that in sixteen boxes
there were papers marked as stated,
but they did not contain papers of the
Botkin case. . .
The Judge, said these papers would
not necessarily be court documents, but
he ordered Leigh to gather them to
gether and bring them into court. All
the exhibits were in the custody of
Oscar Tolle, the former clerk .of the
court, who had them locked up in a
vault at the City Hall. He thought the
better course would be to have Tolle
bring all the exhibits into court and
have them sealed up and placed in the
vault. If there was to be an early trial
perhaps it would be better to leave the
exhibits In Tolle's custody.
The trial was finally set for February
15, and the exhibits ' will remain in
Tolle's custody.
Mrs. Botkin was in court and looked
buxom and smiling. It is apparent that
the fare at the branch County Jail is
agreeing with her.

BOTKIN MURDER
TRIAL IS SET
attorney Knight Springs Sen
sation by Potting Executor
of Chief Lees on the Stand
A mild sensation was sprung in Judge
Cook's court yesterday morning by At
torney George A. Knight when the
case of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, charged
with the murder of Mrs.. Mary. Eliza
beth Dunning 1 in August, 18S8. was
called to be set for trial. Knight said
that E. A. Leigh, executor of the es
tate of the late Chief of Police Lees,
Â¦was In court and he desired to inter
rogate him as to certain papers and
documents connected with the case
that he had found among Chief Lee's
papers.
District Attorney Byington objected,
and said that it was the duty of the
Judge to interrogate Leigh.
Leigh was called to the stand and
after being sworn produced a bundle
which he said he had discovered in a
trunk in the basement of the late Chief
Lees' residence. It was marked "Bot
kin case." The bundle was opened in
the presence of Attorneys Knight, Heg
gerty and McGowan for the defendant
and the District Attorney. It con
tained two empty candy boxes, one
filled with candy, samples of arsenic
and other samples and papers. It was
thought at first that they were the
original exhibits in the case, and sur
prise was expressed at their having
been taken out of the custody of the
clerk of the court, which would have
put an end to the case, but Investiga
tion dlBclosed the fact that not one of
them was marked as an exhibit In the
case. The Judge ordered them placed
in the custody of the clerk.
Knight then said that he understood
there were fifteen or sixteen boxes
marked "Botkin case" in Leigh's cus
tody as executor, and he asked that

TENDER A BAXQITKT
TO EASTERN BUYER
Judging by .the document filed yes
terday' by Ella J. Chamberlain the
truce that was declared a few months
agro 4n the legal battle between her and
her spn-in-law, Butler Smith, the well
known real estate man. was but a tem
porary' relaxation of hostilities. The
fight is now on again, and as before
Mrs. Chamberlain has fired the first
shot. She petitioned the court yes
terday for a citation directing Smith to
appear and explain why he has not
rendered 'an accounting of the $100,000
estate of his late wife. Ella Roberta
Smith; and why he has not paid to
Mrs. Chamberlain the sum of $125 a
month bequeathed to her in her daugh
ter's will.
The fight between Mrs. Chamberlain
and Smith began during the lifetime of
Mrs. Smith. When she died last Feb
ruary Mrs. Chamberlain haled her son
in-law before the Probate Court on an
order directing him to. explain why he
did not file his wife's will. The will,
which is a holographic document,
drawn up a short time before Mrs.
Smith's death, gave to Smith all of her
large estate and directed him to pay to
Mrs. Chamberlain during the rest of
her life the sum of $125 a month. Smith
finally produced the will and offered it
for probate. After a lapse of several
days Mrs. Chamberlain petitioned for
appointment as administratrix, claim
ing that her son-in-law did not exer
cise sufficient haste in taking up the
control of the estate to suit her. This
evidently stirred Smith up, for he im
mediately filed a counter petition. Be
fore the rival petitions came up for
hearing that of Mrs. Chamberlain was
dismissed and the coveted appointment
went to the real estate man. This was
last September, and since then yester
day's appearance of Mrs. Smith is the
only move she has made in the matter.
This, like all .the other moves by her
in the matUr, is prompted by the al
leged dilatory methods of Smith.

: ColTcc Even the Babies Thrive On.
The little daughter of a college presi-
dent was saved by the use of Po3tum
Food Coffee at a time when she coul-1
'not take any solid food.
!. Baby's aunt says: "My sister and her
husband (who is president of a college

and their little baby, two months old,
was very Blck. I thought it was not
properly nourished, so I began feeding
It on Postum, which I have used in my
own home for years with such grand
results. . ' . .' .
"You would be surprised to know
how' that little thing improved. Sister
had' been feeding it on artificial food,
that did not agree with It." The baby
continued to get stronger all the time
we were feeding her on Postum* and ;
when â¢ sister left here she took Postum
with her, ."for, she feels certain that with

FOREIGN DEMAND FOR COPPEK.
The iron and steel nnd tin and cop
per trades were inclined to react upon
each other and the important growth
of foreign demand for copper which
was reported helped the improved sent
iment over the steel outlook. The de
tailed reports of the arguments in v the
Northern Securities case were studied
with great attention in the financial
world, and the bearing of the points
at issue in that case upon a great mass
of corporate securities and upon the
organization of corporations was re
peated with renewed force. This In
fluence was only mitigated by the prob
ability of the final decision of the case
being still deferred for several months.
The approach of the end of the year
brings with it a sense of security in
the ability of the money market to meet
all year-end requirements without dis
turbance. The free return of currency
from the interior and the large inflow
of imported gvld have so fortified the
banking reserves as to afford appar
ently ample. margin for the temporary
requirements Incident to the disburse
ment of dividend and Interest and the
meeting of maturing obligations.
ENGLISH DISCOUNT^ ADVANCES.
The Bank of England was constrained
to advance its discount rate from 4 to 5
per cent in the first week of the year,
and It was estimated that American
securities were being, sent home to the
New York market at the rate of $1,000,
000 a day. It will be remembered v that
the foreign money markets became so
dependent upon American resources
during the following months that oner
half of the total issue of Â£60,000,000 of
British consols was placed with Amer
ican bankers In April, and there was
an important .American participation
during the spring in an Imperial Ger
man loan and in other . German and
Russian loans. It is pointed out as a
possible analogy between that season
and this that gold went out In large
volume from New York in January,
notwithstanding the unprecedented
trade balances piled up in our favor!
Returns of railroad gross earnings for
the first week in December show a
growth in {he ratio of Increase over
last year compared with those for the
fourth week of November, thus con
tributing to the undertone of firmness
in the stock market.
The bond market has failed to reflect
any Investment demand in anticipation
of January disbursements of funds, and
has been; dull, and, irregular. United

Nothing has been heard from the
Philippines in regard to the result of
the examination of candidates for
places on the eligible list of post quar
termaster sergeant of the army. There
arp thirty names oa the list at present
and at the rate of appointment which
has prevailed during the last year it
v ill take two years to make all these
appointments. It is doubtful if ap
pointments during the next year will
be made as rapidly as they have been
in the last twelve months owing to the
reduction of the military force in the
Philippines.
The holiday season in army circles Is

more time during the holiday season is
given over to outdoor sports. At the
post yesterday there were three games
froing on at almost the same time, and
ihey were witnessed by crowds of
something over 4000 people, which in
cluded officers and enlisted men from
all the different posts about the bay,
besides a bfg delegation from town.
The weather was good and the
prounds were in fair shape, considering
the heavy downpour of rain during the
preceding twenty-four hours. The base
ball grounds, on the lower parade, were
sprinkled with sawdust, which was a
great assistance to the players.
The baseball game yesterday between
the Fifteenth Infantry team, from Ord
Barracks; and the Presidio post team
resulted In a victory for the latter with
a score of 10 to 3. The visitors put up
a fine, careful, steady game and worked
hard to win out. but it was evident
from the start that they were out
classed.
FOOTBALIi GAME.
There has been a notable decrease
in the volume of. dealings in stocks this
week and business Has been largely
congested In a few of the specialties, in
which there was evidence of the ac
tivity, of the organized speculative
parties. The advances In these stocks
has served to hold the general market,
despite the apathy and indifference of
the trading. The dullness is normal to
the approach of the holiday period and
the speculative tone is a waiting one.
A large share of attention has been
given to developments in the Iron and
steel trade on account or the series of
meetings held In New York by mem
bers of the pools In various branches
of the trade to decide upon the ques
tion of maintaining prices. There was
much public doubt early in the week
as to the maintenance of rates, and re
ports were freely circulated cf selling
of independents below the schedule,
especially of steel -rails by a number
of the great railroad systems of the 1
country. The rumor regarding the net
earnings of the United States Steel Cor
poration for the current quarter were
also very discouraging. As the meet
ings of the different steel pools were
successively held without making any
changes in the prices of their product
there was a marked change for the bet
ter in the sentiment on the outlook for
the trade. A better Inquiry for forms
of structural steel was- re'ported as a
result of adjustment of som* of the
troublesome labor controversies which
have tied up operations in the building
trades and a firmer tone for plgiron
developed as a result of the heavy cut
ting down of production and the taking
of some large stocks off the market.
The progress of retrenchment of wage
reduction in the trade also gave prom-
NEW YORK, Dec. 19.â A few stocks
supplied all the interest in to-day's
stock market. The continuance of the
recent active speculation in Amalgama
ted Copper, and United States Steel
preferred showed a firm tone on the
better feeling regarding the trade out-,
look. Opinions on the outlook In these
two metal trades are inclined to react
upon each other. There was a repeti
tion of yesterday's attack on Rock
Island and of the rumors of a coming
equipment bond issue, to which that
attack was due. The coalers were no
tably strong, especially the high-priced
stocks in the group. The foreign mar
kets showed in rather pronounced form
a recrudescence of the fears of war be
tween Russia and Japan. A rumor
found circulation that Russia was seek
ing a war loan in Paris and that New
York bankers had been approached to
participate in the loans. A contin
uance for any length of time of the re
cent course of our foreign trade would
offer a probability of some American
investment in foreign Government se
curities, but the volume of demand for
railroad borrowing waiting to be satis
fled by our money" market is for prior
decision. The bank statement showed
an even greater accumulation of cash
reserves than forecasts had indicated
and the preparation for meeting the an
nual dividend and interest disburse
ment is plainly in evidence.
VOLUME IS LIGHT.
Fred Relchert, agent for the Tewks
bury estate property at Point Rich
mond, believes that In a marsh that
belongs to the. estate there Is a vast
deposit of cement. He is led to this
conclusion by some experiments re
cently tried in connection with the pro
posed dredging of a channel across the
marsh to make it possible to float light
draft vessels up to the railway depot
of. the Santa Fe, near Richmond ave
nue.' Mr. Sheldon, president of the
Glencove Transportation Company, was
engaged in making soundings and
traversed a distance of about a' mile,
so Mr. Reichert says. The purpose
was to discover whether it was feasi
ble to dredge out a channel 200 feet
wide of sufficient depth to permit ves
sels to be used by the Glencove Trans
portation Company to pass In and out
freely.
"While the experts were testing the
land," says Mr. Relchert, "to ascer
tain the depth of the sand and to get
at the coat of making a canal, using a
tube to make soundings, they discov
ered that the sand continued down
from six to eight feet over the whole
length of the proposed channel and
that the bottom material would be
more difficult to work out. Upon
closer examination the material at- the
bottom proved to be a soft cement."
Reichert took some of the soft ma
terial. It hardened after a little, until
it became like stone. He advised
with Sheldon, who insisted that he
knew cement when he saw it and that
this was the real thing. Now Reich
ert says that the nature of the soft
substance material in question will be
carefully investigated. If it proves to
be cement, It will be worth a fortune
of great size. He has been Informed
that BOO barrels per day can be dredged
out by an ordinary dredger, and that
the cost of such work will be but $18
per day. As cement is worth $2 65 per
barrel, there would be a large profit if
there is no mistake in the nature and
extent of the discovery.
"I think," said Reichert, "that a con
servative estimate of the extent of the
deposit would be 150,000,000 barrels."

under the national irrigation act.
These are the Truckee River project

Postmaster General Payne has tele
graphed to Chairman Hanna that evi

extortionate rates have been fixed for
the convention by the Chicago hotels
and suggesting that unless assurances
are at once forthcoming that the reg
ular rates are to be charged the
national committee would rescind its
action in selecting Chicago.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19. â What
seems to be an attempt on the part of
the Chicago hotel managers to raise
rates- during the National Republican
Convention is to be nipped in the bud
by the National Republican Commit

Payne said he saw no objection to
the adoption of the resolution, and sug
gested that if tfle minority had no
more remarks to make on the subject
he thought it woiild be unanimously
adopted.
Cowherd (Dem.) of Missouri, a mem
ber of the P^ostoffice Committee, spoke
for that committee, saying the chair
man, Overstreet, had â¢ suggested the
widest publicity to the papers received
from the department. Williams, ad
dressing Cowherd, said:
"I want to suggest to the gentleman
that it has been reported, as shown by
porticos of the report of Messrs. Bona
parte and Conrad, that Certain things
had been covered up, especially in con
nection with Mr. Heath."
Cowherd replied: "I think the gentle
man from Mississippi misunderstands
the report in the publications In the
newspapers. I understand the report
of Messrs. Conrad and Bonaparte to
be on the action of the Postofflce De
partment on the Tullocb/charges, where
it was said there was an attempt to
cover up something in regard to
Mr. Heath.- I do not understand that
report to say that the report of Fourth
Assistant Postmaster General Bristow
aÂ» printed, covering about 400 pages,
was In any .way an attempt to coyer tra
anything involving that gentleman or
anybody else. My impression is that if
the gentleman will examine that re
port, which is found in the newspaper
accounts, he will see that the covering
up referred to was the act of tile Post
master General in refusing to invests
gate the Tulloch . charges."

a substitute for the Wanger resolution

that the reports for which the.resolu

Bohemia was in a blaze of festive
glory last night in honor of the Christ
mas high jinks.' The clubrooms, ap
propriately decorated, were thronged
with members. The attendance was
about the largest In the history of the
club.
The magnitude of the throng was
due in a measure to the very clever
and fitting invitation of the president,
James D. Phelan. which contained the
announcement that Governor Pardee,
John McNaught, Justice Henshaw and
Jvdge Sloss would be seen and heard.
It 'was the. verdict of the llstenera that
the 'sire made an excellent selection of
contributors and it was likewise the
general opinion that the low jinks,
a genial burlesque of "Ben Hur," was
one of the most captivating sketches
ever placed on the stage of Bohemia.
The audience was highly - pleased.
Some of the most pleased of the guests
offered to. buy wine for Will Ir-vin.

exhibition and their generosity was
not permitted to go begging.

CARLISLE INDIANS COMING

THREE MEMBERS.OF. FAMOUS CARLISLE INDIAN, FOOTBALL TEAM, WHICH WILL MEET THE RELIANCE
ALL-CALIFORNIA ELEVEN HERE ON CHRISTMAS DAY. JOHNSON. THE QUARTERBACK, IS NAMED
BY WALTER CAMP ON HIS ALL-AMERICA TEAM.
SALT LAKE. Utah, Dec. 19.â On a
field covered with several Inches of
snow Carlisle .defeated Utah University
by a score of 22 to 0 in two twenty
minute halves. . The gridiron was slip
pery, making It difficult for the Indians
to put their fast playing Into effect,
and this probably held the score down
considerably. Utah was completely
outclassed. -A two-yard and a one
yard gain 'were all the home team could
do when the ball was in Its possession.
After two downs with no gain Bennlon
would kick the ball out of danger. The
Indians Vorked the wing shift play
very successfully and had no trouble
whatever In making their distance.
They were never held for downs. Shel
don's elghty^yard run after receiving
the kick-off,' his course being through
the entire Utah .team before being
downed, was the feature . of the game.
Johnson tried once for place kick from
the field, but .the ball was-fumbled.
Both teams fifmbled considerably on
account of the slippery ball, but It did
not prove costly.

Here they line up and go through for

The action of the Grand Jury on Fri
day last in making a thorough investi
gation of the County Clerk's office and
its probable intention of indicting Al
bert B. Mahony, "Colonel" Martin
Brady, John Pierce and Alonzo David
son for defrauding the city and secur
ing salary warrants by fraud and de
vice, has had its effect. The guilty ones
are worried and efforts are being made
to "reach" certain members of the
Grand Jury to prevent the issuance of
the indictments.
County Clerk Mahony makes a flat
denial of the charges matfe against
him and says he will make a proper
answer when the time comes. Ho claims
that he is a victim of spitework and
charges a certain newspaper of trying
to brinsr about his ruin.
"Colonel" Brady reported for duty
yesterday morning and after looking
over his work and seeing that the of
fice tu running along took his de
parture.
Juigt Frank J. Murasky stated yes-
terday that he had not received any
Indictments as yet, but thought they
\ might be brought In next week when
A' he Grand Jury holds Its meeting. He
eaid he knew nothing of the matter
outside of what he had read In the
newep.apers. In the event the indict
ments are brought in the indicted offi
cials must appear before him or some
other magistrate and have their bail
fixed.
The Grand Jury is to meet on Wed
nesday' afternoon. On that occasion
it will take up the examination of
John J. Cassidy of the United Rail
roads, who may also be indicted on
thÂ« same charges.
The County Clerk declined to make
a statement yesterday until it * was
jmlnted out to him that he owed it to
himself to make a defense.
"I have been guilty of tjo crime,"
Eaid Mahony. "and I do not fear an In
dictment. My office has been run
properly and certain people are trying
to injure me through spite. The papers
mentioned to-day that John Pierce had
received money for not working. They
gave his occupation as a livery-stable
keeper. No such man worked in
my office.
"There was a John Pierce in this of
fice, but the Grand Jury has been mis
led. Alonzo Davidson is an aged man
and his son did the work for him- The
old man needed the money and he held
.copy to compare what . the son had
M Â¦ J itten. John McKenna is around the
office all the time and is doing his work.
Colonel Brady is here every day and
does his worlc The index books will
prove my assertion. "
Followers of the strenuous game of
football will see the. real, article on
Christmas day. , The Carlisle Indians
are coming to play the All-Calif ornlans,
teams that represent the brawn and
muscle of the two big universities and
the athletic clubs of both sides of the
bay. Carlisle will line up against a
team that is heavier than any eleven
they have gone against this season.
For the last week and during the com
ing week the All-Californians will line
up twice a day. Many of the men have
played during the season and are In
good condition. By next Friday they
should be in form and capable of giv
ing the Indians a great game.
It will be remembered the Indians
visited this city some years ago and
tried conclusions with the fanous Cali
fornia eleven trained by Garry Coch
ran of Princeton. In that game the
Indians received an awful surprise.
They scored two points^on a safety.
Throughout that the Indians' goal was
in a> much danger as the Berkeley
boys'. The showing made by the col
lege men surprised the entire country
and save this State prestige in foot
h.nll circles, as the Carlisle Indians that
year scored against the "bis four" â
Yale, Pennsylvania. Harvard and
Princeton. ' -:"Â» V
The Indians are coming this year
with a better eleven. Johnson, their
captain and quarterback, was eel<jpted
by Walter Camp, the great football au
thoilty, as a member cf tin All-Ameri
can team for 1903, He is % drop klckÂ«r
par excellence,' surpassing little Hud
son, who played with the visitors when
they came here the first time.
ESKIMO PLAYS CENTER,
Their Eskimo center Is also a clever
player. He is the only member of his
race playing football and this hardy
son of the frozen north is big and
strong enough to break up Interference
and go down the field on kicks with
speed. As usual the Indians are fast
on getting into play.^ They line up In
stantly and keep hammering their op
ponent's line from the opening of the
game until the referee's whistle signals
the end of the second half. . .
The Indians will be greatly surprised
when they line up against the All-
Californlans. They will find themselves
up against a team of well trained men.'
The average -weight of the team is 180
pounds to a man. ' Even the ends-
Hamilton, Tarpey and Smockâ are very
heavy and eijergetic players.
Pete Smith* has taken hold of the
material he has collected and is drill
ing them afternoon and evening in
straight football. The men are enthu
siastic and are taking the best of care
of themselves. Already half of ; them
are in shape and before next Friday
they ought to have rounded Into wln
nlnsr form. Smith has material enough

MAKES DENIAL
which he believed to be $30,000 to $40,000,
or more.
Norman McLaren, the bookkeeping
expert who Is making the Investigation,
stated he has already ascertained that
McKowen had deposited in his personal
bank account moneys which had been
paid to him by Dr. d'Ancona for de
posit to the credit of the department
of medicine, and that the greater part
of these funds had been embezzled.
McKowen had also appropriated to his
own use moneys deposited with him by
students as security against damage to
laboratory instruments.
Certain scholarship accounts which
should have showed a credit balance
in the ledger showed a debit balance
Instead, and had so shown for several
years, a matter which should, in Mr.
McLaren's opinion, have been reported
by the auditor. Acceptance of dona
tions appeared on the minutes, but the
Income from them was embezzled. The
secretary's cash book was always be
hind date. Medical accounts showed a
debit balance, when they should have
appeared as a credit balance.
WOULD HAVE REPORTED.
"If you had been auditor, what would
you have done?" inquired the Gover
nor.
"I would have made inquiry at once
and reported my findings," was the ex
pert's prompt reply. Then he stated
that money deposited in McLaren's
own name belonged to the medical and
anthropological departments.
Discussion of possible remedy for the
apparent defects in the finance system
at, the university brought from Mr.
Dohrmann the opinion that the person
who keeps books should not be allowed
to handle cash, and that all university
funds should pass through the hands
of a cashier, a woman preferred, as the
treasurer can only attend to the mon
eys he gets. "But we can only do the
best we can to prevent defalcation,"
said Mr. Dohrmann, "as no system can
make it impossible where dishonesty
exists." * i
As a requisite to legal action against
McKowen, Mr. McEnerney moved that
the finance committee be authorized to
demand all university moneys received
by him and not accounted for. The mo
tion was carried, and then the finance
committee, also on motion of Mr. Mc-
Enerney. was authorized to ricommend
to the board at its next meeting a
proper person to act as permanent sec
retary, and to submit at the same time
a detailed report of whatever changes
in the conduct of the secretary's office
it might deem advisable.
In the meantime the acting secretary
is required to remit daily to the treas
urer all funds received by him, and is
under instruction to abstain from col
lecting any check which the treasurer
has not indorsed. Then, on moticn of
Mr. Foster, it was decided to exact a
J10.000 bond from the acting secretary.
CAHEL.ESS BANKING.
President Wheeler stated that h? had
been informed of one instance where
McKowen had indorsed and collected a
check which had been drawn as pay
able to the Regents of the University.
Mr. McLaren said he had not discovered
any such check, and Mr. McEnerney
ventured the opinion that the bank
that cashed such a check was not free
from negligence. President Wheeler
maintained that McKowen had repeat
edly collected on checks which were not
made payable to him personally.
Then the board went into executive
â¢session with Auditor Herr and ad
journed till January 12.

It loc.Jcs as if Auditor John J. Herr
Is to- be disciplined by the State Board
of University Regents for negligence
in connection with his examination of
Secretary McKov.en's books and vouch
ers. â¢
At a meeting of the Regents yester
day afternoon in the Hopkins Insti
tute of Art it was moved by Mr. Earl
that the auditor's office be declared va
cant. "for obvious reasons." as Mr.
Earl was "satisfied the blame lay right
there." The motion v.-as withdrawn
v-hen several other Regents had opined
that the auditor should be given a
hearing, and subsequently Mr. Herr
Â¦was taken into executive session and
grilled for an hour as to his Inspection
of the embezzling secretary's accounts.
He said he had examined all the
bocks and vouchers that had been sub
mitted to him by McKowen, which did
rot include the receipts for scholar
ship and fâ¬liovi-Â£hip funds and fees from
the medical department Then the in
quiry was continued till January 12.
by which tirr.e, it Is expected, the ex
perts at work on MeKowen's books will
have completed their task and the
finance committee wffl be able to re
port to the board the exact amount of
the defalcations and the method em
ployed by the defaulter.
Governor Pardee presided. The other

GOVEROR EXPLAINS.
When sixty-three degrees hkd been
granted, as against twenty-eight last
year, the Governor briefly recounted
the McKowen confession of dishonesty
and invited the board's action In regard
to it. Mr. McEnerney openeu the pro
ceedings by moving that the office of
secretary bÂ» declared vacant and that
Victc-r Henderson be appointed to fill
it temporarily, which was unanimously
done. It was then that Mr. Earl made
his motion in regard to the auditor.
Tvhieh was subsequently withdrawn.
Mr. Foster, as chairman of the finance
committee, had no report to Â¦offer fur
ther than to state that an espert In
vestigation of McKowen's botrks and
vouchers is now In progress to ascer

The desire to improve the National
Guard of California is developing day

word that the commanding officers are

vere criticisms that in many places
have cut deep.

INTERESTING READING.
The various officers of the regiment
have been instructed to pay particular
attention to the interesting reading
matter that there is in general order
No. 2, issued last October from di
vision headquarters, in which many of
the shortcomings of the guard are set
forth. <>W
There Is much wonderment all along
the line, that as yet no change has been
made in the office of the adjutant gene
ral at Sacramento. Shortly after the
commander in chief of the State forces
assumed command It was announced
that the incumbent would resign.
A prominent military man, who
served during the Civil "War and
has had many years service in
the National Guard of this State,
was informed when he present
ed his claims for the office: "Very sor
ry, colonel, that you did not present
your claims for the office before, but
the choice has already beed made."
Thl^.was three months ago and all In
terested are wondering -why the choice
has not been announced.
An election has been .ordered for Jan
uary 5 in Company I. Livermore. for
first lieutenant* vice Hunter, term ex
pired. ; { _.'iv~:
*, Theodore J. Savage has been ap
pointed ; by General "Warfleld major and
judge advocate on "the staff of the Sec
ond Brigade, vice Major Dora, pro
moted colonel, and appointed on the
staff of the 'commander in chief.
A meeting of officers called by Major
General Dickinson for. the purpose of
discussing the needs of the guard at
this time was held a few days ago.
There were present Division Comman
der Dickinson. General Muller of the
Third Brigade. General. "Warfleld and
his adjutant; Colonel Burgin; Lieuten
ant Colonel Dockweller. Colonel O'Neil
of the First Infantry, Colonel Seymour
of the â¢ Second, Colonel Hayes of the
Fifth and. Colonel Berry of the Seventh.
The artillery Â¦ battalion was not repre
sented." .,
PURPOSE- OF MEETING..
General Dickinson stated the purpose
of the meeting and called for sugges
tions for the betterment of the condi
tion of /the guard. Papers were read
by Colonels Seymour, Berry and Hayes,
and one of these was to the effect that,
the time "that men give to becoming
proficient In the duties of a soldier out
side of the time In camp amounts in all
to 16J<Â£ days a year, too short a time to
learn all that should be learned.
Colonel Burgin suggested that a pam
phlet be placed in the hands of every
man instructing him as to the requi
sites of a soldier so that he could study
the same when not In the armory. He
suggested that the same ought also to
contain the proper form for what is
known as "the paper work."
Colonel Seymour read a copy of a
letter sent to each commander in his
regiment showing in detail all that
should be attended to.
Colonel Hayes called attention to the
difficult concentration when the com
panies of the regiment are as widely
separated cs they are In the Fifth In
fantry and drew attention to the lack
of preparation there was when the
regiment was ordered to Sacramento
on a hurry-up order in 1334, showing
that there had noi been any arrange
ments for providing the men with food
or shelter, but that each company com
mander was left to do the best he
could for his men.
The major general remarked that
that was an oversight.
Colonel Wilhelm, United States In
spector of the guard, spoke at some
length, giving the officers something
to think about. He said that measures
must be taken to make the officers
more studious, that attention must be
paid to drill regulations, that the gen
eral rules and rules of general appli
cation are not sufficiently understood.
AS TO GUARD DUTY.
He also spoke of the Importance of
guard duty; of the manual of the
same; of the necessity of the addition
of trumpet, sword or whistle signals
for extended orders; of observing the
unwritten customs when National
Guardsmen serve with regulars; of
the importance of squad formation; of
the proper construction of racks; of
the use of cosmollne for suns; of the
sei-uringr of ranges suitable for target
practice, especially for the shorter dis
tances suited for United States firing
regulations* and as to parades and
reviews he said they are essential and
must be properly carried on.
He concluded by calling attention to
the fact that the cadence of movement
Is too slow and without snap through
out the entire National Guard and that
bands are a drag in this respect.
No action was taken at the meeting
in regard to what was under discus
sion, but in the evening there was a
banquet in Golden Gate Hall, where
all were in attendance except General
Wnrfield, but tlr company was added
to by the present of Adjutant General
Stone and Major Bush of the artillery.
The bids for uniforms for the guard
were opened yesterday. The lowest bid
for blouses was by the Pettlbone Com
pany, $5 95 each, and for caps by Pas
quale & Sons, $1 24J^. If these bids are
accepted and the number agreed upon
ordered that "will leave a balance of
$4725 to expend for the purchase of
trousers.

instead of taking advantage' <5f this

early pace. Then on the back stretch
Johnny rushed the favorite into the
lead and it looked as the stretch was
reached cs if he might win. When
challenged by Oliphant on Lord Mel

pameness, but his impost of 119 pounds
begran to tell and in a hard drive Lord
Melbourr.e earned the decision by a
neck. The winner was in nice and
snag: with 97 pounds and received per
fect handling. Modicum finished third,
several lengths before Major Tenny.
A sloppy track made perfect footing

SANTA ROSA. Dec. 19.â Mre. Nellie
Goess of Sonoma Jumped through a
second-story window of the Golden
West Hotel at that place at an early
hour this morning and . sustained seri
ous Injuries. She was cut in a number
of places about the body and lost con
siderable blood.
The woman was recently shot in the
head by her husband, Fred Groess,
and the latter then committed suicide.
Since receiving her Injury the woman
has been flighty and has needed con
stant attention. During the absence of
her nurse she took the leap through
the glass and was attempting to hurl
herself from a portico into the street
below when she was restrained. Physi
cians who have been attending the
woman are convinced her mind is per
manently affected and it Is probable
she will be examined as to her sanity.

for Mrs. A. Soule of San Francisco,
who has been missing since Thursday
afternoon. On that day Mrs. Soule

town on business and missed the after
noon train to San Francisco.

cisco and declaring her intention of
walking there Mrs. Soule started out
and has not been seen since. Her rela

On the former trial of the suit of
Evelyn J. Pierce against the Southern
Pacific Company the Jury disagreed.
Eddie Hanlon's collection of ball toss
ers got the decision over the stars
which Young Corbett led out on the
field yesterday at Recreation Park.
Referee Eddie Graney's figures showed i
that the. score was 9 to 5. Corbett pro
tested the game on the grounds that
the ring was too big and also averred
that Hanlon's men did not break clean
at the getaways from flrst.'base, and
further states that the gloves of the
opponents were eighty-seven ounce In
stead of the five-ounce regulation size.
Hanlon had a wonderful team to help
him to victory. T. Algernon Dorgan
was carded chase flies in the right
garden, but forgot himself so far as
to get under cover of the fence when
ever a ball was smote In his direction.
Handsome Eddie Healy dispensed the
curves for Hanlon, but after h.e ap
pealed to the referee several times the
opposition had pity on him and refused
to clout the leather.
Tim McGrath appeared In an "all
green suit. When the police officers
eaw It they ruled him oft the grounds,
so he was unable to perform. Both
Hanlon and Corbett played good ball
at the second bag, though the latter
made a wide throw to first base in the
second round that turned the tide
against his team. Following Is the line

HANLON'S BALL TEAM WINS
FROM CORBETT'S TOSSERS
Herbert Long was too strong for his
younger brother and beat him in
straight sets. Schmidt and Rolfe
played a tie, each winning a set.
Allen and MacGavin will play off
their two unfinished matches to-day.
One will be played on the California
Club courts and the other at the park.
Melville Long, a youngster who
learned the game at the park, made
his first appearance as a member of
the club. He carried off the honors
In a close match with Harry Gabriel.
At the park Gabriel plays in a class
above Long. The score was 6-4, 5-7,
7-5.
Lloyd Baldwin and Will Page are
rapidly developing into a strong dou
bles team. They have been beaten
but once. They have not tackled any
of the top notch teams yet, but the
lower class men are easy prey for
them. They took on Long and Tobin
yesterday and before the latter could
get warmed up ran out a love set on
them. The winners then played
Schmidt and Rolfe and won the first
set 6-4. In the second set Rolfe and
Schmidt put more life into their play
and won a love set.
After an absence of several months
from the courts Dr. Sumner Hardy
made his reappearance and played
some fast sets with Robert Drolla.
Drolla was outclassed and was unable
to get a set.
dry, but the cracks did not appear.
The best match of the day was a
doubles between Harry Rolfe and
Herbert Schmidt and Sidney Salisbury
and Frank Stringham. These teams
met two weeks ago and when dark
ness set in each had won two sets and
stood even on the fifth. They again
showed how evenly they are matched.
Salisbury and Stringham won the first
two sets quite handily, but the young-
Bters turned the tables on them in the
succeeding two sets, which they won
with equal ease. Schmidt and Rolfe
played more aggressively in the last
two sets and put their opponents on
the defensive. The score was 6-4,
6-1, 2-6. 3-6.
In the singles Joe Tobin and Her
bert Long played two fast sets. The
veteran proved too strong for his
younger opponent and took him into
camp in straight sets. Long and To
bin met during the week, when the
former won two sets. Tobln was
steady yesterday, while his opponent
had one of his wild days. The score
was 6-1, 6-4.
The threatening weather made the
attendance on the tennis courts rather
light yesterday afternoon. The Cali
fornia Club courts dried out in time
to permit of a few matches being
played. Some of the park courts were

on July 11, 1900. at Gibsons Switch, In
Shasta County, the jury was locked vcp
yesterday afternoon by United States
Circuit Judge Hanford with instruc
tions that should it come to an agree
ment before the. opening of court on
Monday morning It should bring in a

verdict at 3 p. m.

IS PIERCE DAMAGE SUIT
Only two matches for the champion
ship of the California Association Foot
ball League will be played to-day in
stead of three, as usual. At 10:30 a. m.
the ball will be kicked off on the Pre
sidio Athletic Grounds in the game be
tween the Thistle eleven and the In
dependent team. This will be the in
teresting match of the day and will
attract most attention from the lovers
of the game. \
At 2:30 In the afternoon the ball will
be kicked off in the match between
the Vampire and Occidental elevens on
the cricket ground at Webster street,
Alameda. A victory for the Vampire3
is almost a foregone conclusion and
this will bring their score in the league
championship table up to 13 points,
seven matches having been played.
If the Thistles win from the Inde
pendents they will have 12 points for
six matches and so will be in a slightly
better position than the Vampires. If,
however, the Thistles lose, they will
have 10 points for six matches and so
be a point behind the leaders. The In
dependents play a hard game and will
not be easy, to beat.
The game arranged to take place be
tween the second elevens of the Oak
land Hornets and the Vampires on the
cricket grounds at Alameda this morn-
Ing, beginning at 11 o'clock, has been
called off, as many of the members of
both teams are desirous of attending
the match between the Thistles and
Independents. The match between the
Oakland Hornets and the Albion Ro
vers, which was set for 2r30 p. m. to
day at Idora Park, Oakland, has been
called off.
In the opening round of matches for
the California Association Football
Union cup the Thistles will play against
the Pickwicks* on January 3 at the Pre
sidio Athletic Grounds, Arthur Robin
son being the referee, with Henry Rob
erts and C. W. Irish as linesmen. On
Sunday, January 31, the Vampires will
meet the Independents and the Occi
dentals will play against the Oakland
Hornets. The Albion Rovers draw the
bye. In the second and semi-final
round the Albion Rovers and the win
ners of the Vampire-Indepenlent, Hor
net-Occidental and Thistle -Pickwick
matches will take part.
L. R. Gillchrest of the Albion Rovers
has been chosen assistant secretary of
the California Association Football
League, the work connected with which
Is too exacting to be performed by one
man.
Lovers of the Sport Will Gather to

ONXY TWO ASSOCIATION
FOOTBALL GAMES TO-DAY
NEW YORK, Dec. 19.â The Financier
this week says: The striking feature of
the official statement of the New York
Asscoiated Banks was, as was the case
in the previous week, the close corre
spondence in the gain of cash with the
estimated Increase in this item, which
estimate was based upon the traceable
movements of money during the week.
The large gain of cash would seem to
indicate that the average amount
brought over from the week ending De
cember 12, together with the average
receipts of gold from Europe last week,
had been fully reflected in the state
ment. The increase of cash reported !
in the bank return was J7.304.6OO, of
which $5,553,400 was specie; the esti
mates called for a gain of J6.931.700 as
the result of the movements. The de
posits increased $5,429,300, and the re
sulting gains in "reserve requirements
was $1,357,075. Deducting this sum from
the increase in cash leaves $5,947,525 as
the gain in surplus reserves to J14.025,
500. Calculated upon the basis of de
posits, less those of $35,829,800 public
funds, the surplus Is $23,232,950. The
statement showed a remarkably good
balance, the sum of the gain in cash,
less the decrease in loans, being only
$277,300 smaller than the increase in de
posits. Loans were decreased $2,153,600,
as was expected from the cancellation
of these on stock collateral during the
week. The daily average of bank clear
ings was $197,000,000, against $221,000,000
in the previous week, reflecting a
smaller volume of business. The clear-
Ings on Saturday, representing the ex
changes on the previous day, were
$194,834,886. The statement as a whole
may be regarded as a remarkably good
one. Comparisons of loans show that
seven of the larger banks reduced the
reserve by $2800 net. The increase of
cash by six Institutions was $6,80O;OO0.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 19.â Tom Pen
dergast, who fought "Kid" "Williams
last night before the Acme Athletic
Club, died this morning from the ef
fects of the beating he received. He
had been unconscious for several hours.
Williams was placed in jail at 6 o'clock
this morning.
Concussion of the brain is assigned as
the cause of death. A couple of yeais

/Â£ ' Â¦ - * . . . Â¦ - â¢ - cMartin Regensberger, executor of the
will of the late Emma K. Loring, the
eccentric woman who died in a myster
ious manner In her Sacramento-street
home last June, yesterday filed an an
swer to the contest of Mrs. Loring's
will brought by Johanna Reeder of New
York, who claims to be a sister of the
deceased and who says she is the Jo
hanna "Rieder" mentioned in the will.
The answer is a complete denial of all
the charges set up by Mrs. Reeder in
her opposition to the probate of the
will.
The disputed will of Mrs. Loring left
all her property to her daughter, the
late Emma May Attenborough, whose
death followed close upon that of her
mother." When she offered the^will for
probate there was" no opposition, â¢ but
shortly. after her death, when her hus
band George Attenborough applied for
letters of administration upon her es
tate, which included the property left
her by Mrs. Loring, Mrs. Reeder op
posed the petition. She claimed that
she, as the sister of Mrs. Loring. was
entitled to the estate and advanced the
charge th'at Mrs. Attenborcrogh was not
the daughter of the deceased. She al
leged further that the will under which
Mrs. Attenborough inherited the Lor
ing estate was a void document, be
cause it had written across its face and
under the signature of the deceased the
word "canceled."
In dealing with these charges Regens
berger avers that Mrs. Reeder's allega
tions are without proof. He says that
she has not shown that she is the
"Rieder" mentioned in the will, nor
has she shown that she is entitled ta
any consideration as the sister of Mrs.
Loring. "Mrs. Lorins." says the an
swer, "never had a sister."
It is also averred in the answer that
the opponent of the will has not estab
lished her claim of the right to use the
name Reeder or- "Rieder," and says
that "neither in law nor equity has
she a right to the names."

Levy Is the 1 Result of an Oil Stock
Transaction, Which Will Be
Aired In Court.
A writ of attachment in the sum
of $1855 was served yesterday at the
instance of Mrs. A. Freese on certain
jewelry belonging to Mrs. A. L. Smith
and now in the hands of Chief of Po
lice Wittman. The writ is the out
come of an oil stack transaction in
which Mrs. Smith induced Mrs.
Freese to purchase certain shares of
the Gray Gander Oil Company, which,
it is now alleged, are worthless. Mrs.
Smith is now in Washington in con
nection with the oil stock transactions
in that State. Suit was instituted in
the Superior Court by Mrs. Freese in
this city against her for the recovery
of the money paid for the stock and
the jewelry belonging to Mrs. Smith
was levied upon in the event that
judgment is obtained by Mrs. Freese.

"JACK HUGGER"
RUNS BIG RISK
Depraved^ Freak Persists in
Pursuing Young Women
in* the t - City of Colleges
FOLLOWS "HELLO" GIRLS
Miss Â¦Laura Kern .and Miss
Lena McKeown Are Fright
ened by Strange Degenerate
BERKELEY, - Dec. 19.â "Jack the
; Hugger" is taking big risks these days
and stands a very good chance of being
tarred and feathered and ushered out
of town astride of a sticky pole with
citizens on each end of it. "Jack" has
been getting bolder and bolder of late
and now carries on his operations in
the very heart of town, where it is
easier to get victims. Up to this time
he has not succeeded in getting his boa
constrictor arms around anybody, but
he is persevering.
"Jack's" latest victims are Miss
Laura Kern and Miss Lena McKeown,
both young "hello" girls employed in
the local telephone office. Miss Kern
was followed twice by the man, once
on Thursday night . and again last
night, and only, because she is a fast
runner did she escape the insistent fel
low. Miss McKeown escaped his im
portunities because she was accompan
ied by her brother.
The man is evidently acquainted with
the movements of the girls, for he has
made it a point to meet them on their
way home after they are dismissed
from the office at U o'clock. Â£ On
Thursday night' he was standing in
front of the office when the girls came
out and joined Miss Keown's brother.
Last night he intercepted Miss Kern
whilo she was on her way home alone.
"The man followed us all along Shat
tuck avenue to University avenue,"
said Miss Kern to-day. "Then he fol
lowed me down University avenue to
my home at No. 2005. I saw him com
ing after me and ran. He ran, too, but
I managed to escape him and get into
my door first. He turned then and ran
back after Miss McKeown, but she was
still with her brother and he did not
molest them.
"L,ast night I saw the same man
standing on the corner of University
and Shattuck avenues. He followed me
a little distance down University ave
nue, but I became frightened and
sought the protection of a woman
standing on the corner. She walked to
my door with me and the man lingered
behind, but he did not attempt to mo
lest us."
Miss McKeown said that after she
left Miss Kern Thursday night she
saw the man following her and re
marked the circumstance to her
brother. They stood at the corner,
however, until they saw Miss Kern get
safely Into her ' door and then went
home. Â¦ That was. the,, last she saw of
the man.
The girls' description of the man
agrees with that of the man who has
been operating around town lately. He
is described as tall and brawny and
wears an overcoat and derby hat.

Wants Administrator Suspended

Davidie Demartini as administrator of
the $5200 estate of Gerolamo Demar
tini wa3 filed yesterday by Giovanni
Demartini, a brother of the decedent.
The suspension ia sought on the .
ground that the administrator is abus-1

actions that if allowed to proceed will
render of little value the claims to
the estate of certain heirs of Demar

NEW YORK, Dec. 19.â Negotiation!
have been completed by the St. Loul;
and San Francisco* Railroad for a^nev
alliance, which will admit the Rod
Island Frisco system to New Orleans
This plan has been worked out witl
the Southern Railway and will save th<
Frisco from building a line from Mem
phis to Baton Rouge, which involvec
the possibility of antagonizing t h <
Gould interests. The original plan o
the Frisco management called for th<
construction of an Independent line, 3
right of way was obtained and pre
llmlnary steps taken for financing th<
new construction. Jointly with th<
Southern Railway, extensive termina
facilities in New Orleans were planned
to cost between $12,000,000 and $14,000,
000. Between $2,000,000 and $3,000,001
has. been expended on this work.
; TheIron Mountain already had wel
under way the construction of its Nev
Orleans line and negotiations for Its
use by the Frisco, thereby saving th<
latter- 300 miles of construction, wen
well under way, when a dispute arose
over ' local traffic and the deal fel
through.
President Toakum of the Frisco ther
suggested to President Spencer of th<
Southern Railway the feasibility of th<
Frisco reaching New Orleans over the
Southern's Mobile and Ohio and New
Orleans and Northeastern route. II
was decidedly to the interest of th<
Southern to have the Frisco In New
Orleans oxÂ£ account of their joint ter
minals there. Without any delay the
jnatter was carried forward, and th(
directors of the St. Louis and Sar
Francisco have now ratified the new
project.^
The Frisco's new route will be some
what Indirect for traffic from St. Louis
and Chicago, but will enable the sys
tem to handle its own tonnage frorr
the Birmingham district. It is pointed
out that the Rock Island traffic from
the West and Southwest will reach the
Gulf by way of Galveston If the joint
ownership of the Harriman North and
South Texas lines Is finally sanctioned,
Connections between the Frisco. and
the Mobile and Ohio are made at Tu
pelo and Jasper, Miss., and Birming
ham, Ala. The Mobile and Ohio con
nects with the New Orleans and North
eastern at Meridian^ The route by way
of - TuDelo from , Memphis would be
about forty miles longer than the route
originally planned down the Mississippi
River. .
thrown a rope over the wall from the
outside and was aiding the prisoners
In their break for liberty, when he fell
from the top of the high wall to the
stone pavement below and will proba
bly die from the injuries he received.
He is badly hurt about the head.
Baker had three friends confined In
the jail, which Is made up of rows of
ceils on two sides and high walls on
the remaining two sides. He secured
a long rope, which, by means of a hook,
he fastened to the top of the wall and
succeeded in scaling it from the out-,
side. He then let the rope down on the
inside, and twelve prisoners not locked
in their cells climbed to the top of the
wall, where Baker was waiting for
them. When the latter let the rope
down on the outside and started to
lead the descent he in some way lost
his hold and fell to the pavement be
neath. The noise of the fall attracted
the attention of the night Jailer, *who
was in his office, about 100 feet away,
and he hurried out to see what had
happened. The prisoners on the wall
then slid back down the rope to the in
side, fearing that the Jailers would
commence shooting when he saw that
an escape was being attempted.
Baker was picked up unconscious
and was sent to the hospital, while a
charge was preferred against him. The
majority of the prisoners who attempt
ed to escape belonged to a gang; of
tramps who took possession of a South
ern Pacific freight train between Marl
copa and Tucson about two weeks ago,
were captured . and thrown in Jail for
terms varying from thirty to ninety
days.

BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 19. â The
Green '& Whlttler -well No. 3, which
was drilled some years ago to a depth
of 1140 feet and which was considered
remarkable because of the fact that It
went through 400 feet of oil sand with
no intervening strata of clay, has de
veloped a most extraordinary freak.
Recently the well caused so much
trouble that the Associated, which
now controls the property, pulled the
tubing and the workmen were dum
founded to find that the last 240 feet
were bent completely out of plumb,
the supposltipn being, of course, that
the casing is In the same condition,
so as to render It. unfit for use. No
explanation has been offered for this
strange freak, although some suggest
that there m&y be an Imperceptible
movement of the oil sand, but as no
other wells In the field are affected
this theory Is but little accepted.
Suggestion Is Made That an Impercep
tible Movement of the Sand May
Have Caused the Damage.

CRESCENT CITY, Dec. 19.â Details
have been obtained of the sea disaster
which resulted in the loss of the
schooner Mary Buhne after her col
lision u-ith the steamer Del Norte Fri
day morning.
The Del Norte, bound from San Fran
cisco to this port, collided with tha
Mary Buhne at 5:45 o'clock eight miles
off Humboldt Bar. The Mary Buhne
sank thirty minutes after the collision
The Del Norte lowered her boats and
rescued the crew of the" schooner.
In lowering the lifeboats from the
Del Norte three of the crew were
thrown Into the water. One man was
drowned. The Del Norte lay by until
daylight and then came on to this port,
arriving late In the afternoon.
The Del Norte was steaming head on
in her regular course and caught the
schooner on the bow. The Del Norte
Buffered no serious injury in the col
lision. "When the crew of the Buhne
left their vessel her deck was but six
inches above water. A passenger on
the Del Norte states that the crew of
the Buhne claim they were carrying the
regular lights when the Del Norte ran
her down. The second officer was in
charge of the Del Norte at the time of
the collision.
EUREKA, Dec. 19.â Captain Peterson
of the tug ganger stated to-day that
two vessels were sighted Thursday
when he made the regular trip out,
one of which he took to be the Mary
Buhne and the other the Mary E. Russ.
The latter was towed in about "10:30
Â¦o'clock yesterday morning.
When Interviewed Captain Nyman of
the Mary E. Russ said that he had been
outside two days before being picked
up by the tug. On Thursday he sighted
a schooner six or seven miles to the
westward of him, which he took to be
the Mary Buhne. Yesterday the
schooner was in the same direction,
distant about ten miles. While being
towed in Nyman was using his glasses
and noticed the schooner and a steamer
near it. When he looked again the
schooner had disappeared and he saw
it no more. Telephonic communication
with Trinidad elicited the response that
nothing had been seen of the Mary
Buhne or the Del Norte.
The Mary Buhne was built at the
Bendlxsen shipyard |n 1876 and was
one of the best known and oldest craft
that came to this port. She was owned
by the Charles Nelson Company of San
Francisco, which was her home port.
The Buhnes of this place owned one
fourth Interest in the Mary Buhne and
McKay & Co. also had an Interest in
her.

The Joke on Himsrlf.
Rear Admiral Charles S. Cotton, who
has been entertained abroad with sin
gular splendor and heartiness, sat one
evening at a dinner party beside the
Bishop of Durham, a clergyman noted
for his wit.
Near the Bishop there was a million
aire manufacturerâ a stout man with a
loud, coarse laugh, who ate and drank
a good deal, and who cracker every lit
tle while a stupid joke.
One of the man's Jokes was leveled at
the brilliant Bishop of Durham, whom
he did not know from Adam. It was
enough for him that the Bishop's garb
v.as clerical. He was a parson; here,
therefcTe, was a chance to poke a little
fun at the parson's trade.
"I have three sons," he began, in a
loud tone, nudging his neighbor and
winking toward the Bishop, "three fine
lads. They are in trade. I have always
said that If ever I had a stupid son I'd
make a parson of him."
The millionaire roared out his discord.

said to him, with a quiet smile:

The large number of personal letters*
received since my last communication
relative to the location of the grave of
Robert Morris and my references indi
cating the historian's inconslderatlon of
this great revolutionary character has
impelled me to make acknowledgments
of gratefulness. Most of the letters
carr.e from teachers and a few from
librarians, and they entertained the
idea that Morris was burled at White
marsh. Md. A few of the writers were
of the opinion that he was burled in
Virginia, the exact spot not known to
them. It afforded me pleasure to learn
of the deep Interest manifested and all
seem to indicate a desire to assist in
awakening thought regarding the sacri
ficing element in the nature of>Morris.
Three of the writers are direct descend
ants of Merrls and stated that for years
they have sought the grave of their an
cestor; one of these gentlemen has
kindly sent me records indicating the
character of his search, and It Is sur
prising how very little is recorded con
cerning the last days and death of the
venerable colonial. Another kinsman
â¢generously forwarded a copy of the New
York Herald, dated September 27. 1S01.
This sheet contains a most Interesting
account of the effort made by the paper
to locate the grave and devotes a Ion?
Rrtlcle. embellished with ten Illustra
tions, to this interesting theme and In
troduces the fact that his real place of
burial is a matter of doubt.
DEATH PLACE IN DOUBT.
Permit this extract:
"Four years ago, or about that time,
a law was passed by Congress to reim
burse to the heirs of Robert Morris ths
$1,500,000 which was due him, with In
terest, now amounting in the neighbor
hood of $8,000,000. The heirs have been
active, and some Interesting discoveries
have been made, among the facts es
tablished beyond controversy being the
following:
"Robert Morris was born in England
in 1734, but did not die. as related by
history, in a debtor's prison in Philadel
phia, but on a small farm in the neigh
borhood of Fairmlngdale. X. J.. in 1325.
twenty years later than recorded in his
tory. During the last years of his life
he was cared for and devotedly nursed
by a granddaughter named Mary Hur
ley, now (1891) living with her own
granddaughter at Toms River, N. J.
His history Just previous to coming to
Farmingdale no one Is able to give.
The fact of his reticence concerning
those previous years and the entire Ig
norance of the family on the point may
suggest the probabllty of collusion
from some quarter while he was in
prison. The fact that Robert Morris*
grave cannot be found In Christ
Christ. Philadelphia, and that there
have never been any heirs coming for
ward to claim him, would all go to fa
vor the theory that some one in pri3on
permitted him to escape and allowed
him to live in seclusion at Farming
dale. This is enough to account for
the family Ignorance and great dis
crepancy in historical accounts of his
death."
SIGNATURE AS EVIDENCE.
The same article says that Morris
signed his name In a family Bibleâ the
Bible having been published in 1810â
four years after his supposed death.
The New York Herald then goes on to
relate:
"The signature from the Bible is from
a tracing, as Mrs. Hurley positively re
fuses* to let the Bible go out of her
hands, guarding it with jealous care."
This matter goes to prove that the
life and affairs of the "financier of tho
Revolution" are not clearly registered
in history.
Another gentleman wrote: "My knowl
edge of Morris comes from 'The Lives
of the Signers of the Declaration of In
dependence,' issued In 1820 by Jofen San
derson of Philadelphia and finished by
Robert Walm, and as 1 do not see the
names of these among those you quote
I have taken the liberty to send to you
the word3 of Mr. Walm. which bear up
on his (Morris 1 ) death, together with
the reference In a foot note to 'Garden's
Anecdotes,' page 337, and reads as fol
lows :
" The great and good man Is sunk
Into the tomb on the 8th of May. 1S0S.
in the 73d year of his age. The memory
of a man of such distinguished utility
cannot be lost, and while the recollec
tion of his multiplied services are deep
ly engraven in the tablets of our hearts,
let u*Â» hope that the day Is not distant
when some public monument' recording
the most momentous occurrence of hl3
life and characteristic of national feel
ing and gratitude may mark the spot
where rests the body of Robert Mor
ris.*" m::^
In the nation's literature the career
of Robert Morris is disregarded and his
grave forgotten. As a nation we have
shown r.o special fostering care for the
memory of him who, next to Washing
ton, should claim our heartiest grati
tude. Thl9 does not reflect our highest
national sense of patriotism. Th* re
establishment of Morris In our hearts
and books would proclaim to the living
descendants of this great man our grat
itude for him who in the darkest dav3

The hardest fare that six strong
men Â«ind a boy of 1 5 ever kept alive on
was the daily menu of the Windover's
survivors*, who were cast up on the
IriFh roast near Kilse^rg a few weeks
ego. They lived for sixteen days on
Btev.ed rope yarn, without crumb or
anything else to help digest it except
water, and, though it'made them ill.
the:- kept alive on it and did not
waste away very much.
The Windover was a bark carrying
ealt beUven Fpain and the United
States, with an English crew, and she
was dismasted and abandoned about
1O00 miles out in the Atlantic. Three
of the crew were killed by the falling
marts and two others were washed
overboard, but thcother seven took to
the whaleboat and set out for Britain.
Being in too much of a hurry they
took too little food, but they had
throe large butts of water besides the
tank the boat already held. The re
sult vap that they ate up the provis
visions in four da>s. but had water
enough for a month, and after starv
ing for two days more they tried
boiling lengths of tarred hemp rope
into a pulp and swallowing it. Th^y
had a kÂ«s: of paraffin wax and though
it made them very ill at first, they
eventually contrived to live on the
boiled hemp, the boiled paraffin added
to the nourishment of the rope. They
landed in comparatively good health.
SEAWEED AND KELPIE GRASS.
Two men who went to a small island
off the Irish coast a little while ago
kept themselves going for ten days on
a diet almost worse. They landed in
a boat, which was smashed by a
wave on their trying to relaunch her,
and they were left on the bare, rocky
island without food. Fortunately there
Is a spring on the island, but nothing
in the way of food but gulls, which
they could not catch, and nothing to
make a fire with as a distress signal.
There are not even any shellfish, as
there is no beach, and the pair had to
subsist for the ten days on cold, raw
Eeaneed washed up by the tide. For
two days they starved, but after that
they tackled the seaweed, making
thrÂ«>e meals a day off it until rescued.
When taken off they were a good deal
emaciated, but no ill effects resulted.
The same thing happened off the
same coast five years ago, when four
fisherwonven were imprisoned on an
islet by the loss of their boat. They
lived on "kelpie" grass for six days.
A diet of boots is one of the com
monest of last resource foods, and
though it is hard for a well-fed per
son to imagine that any one could
masticate and digest the leather, a
pa5r of long seaboats will keep a man
alive for a fortnight if he has a little
water. â¢
STEWED LEATHER NOT SO BAD.
Captain Maboly of the foundered
Eteamer Gwailor and his second officer
created a record last year by living for
seventeen days on boot leather and a
pint of water a day each. Of course
no teeth can tear cowhide boots; they
have to be cut up and shredded with
a knife, and the shreds chewed and
swallowed. Boiling, even when possi
ble, does .no good at all. but takes
from the boots what nourishment they
contain. A few ounces of leather, be
ing so hard to digest, stay the stom
ach for fifteen or twenty hours.
The best known and most useful of
starvation diets for wrecked or cast
away people, however, is that of bar
nacles, and if anything of the kind
happens to you they will probably be
your staple food. Barnacles are long,
tough, half shellfish, half vegetable
creatures that grow on Ihe undersides
of vessels. Three Englishmen and a
crew of Lascars who had been forced
to abandon the sailing vessel North
Star a few months ago kept them
selves going for over a week on barna
cles, and only two of the crew died.
The worst of them is that they give
one internal cramps and cause an in
sufferable thirst, but they do nourish
the frame. You have to reach under
the vessel's side and pull them oft,
taking care not to leave the best half
of .them sticking to the planks. Only
a starving person could possibly eat
them. Many a castaway crew, how
ever, has found them better than
nothing. American.
DISPUTES FEW.
"Do you ever have disputes with cus
tomers?"
"Not often. I have only been through
one embarrassing situation of the kind.
A gentleman discovered after having
his book balanced that he was short In
some way to the amount of $500. He
declared to the cashier that his clerk
had deposited a New York draft for
the sum of 5500. He insisted that the
boy brought back a duplicate ticket for
that amount, but he had since lost that
ticket. We consulted the original tick
et, which called for only $300. ( We
wrote to the New York bank requesting
that they send on the paid ticket under
registered mail. When the draft was
examined it was found that It had been
cleared on some other bank, and the
customer's rame was indorsed on the
back. When his memory . was, re
freshed in this unpleasant manner he
apologized. It was very unpleasant
for a while. The bank had me watched
constantly.'!
THE MAN AT THE WINDOW.
When the rush was over the re
porter went up to the window to
pass a word with the man who is
tired out every day counting money.
Did our ancestors ever think such a
thing possible? Does the old lady
with a morsel o' siller in the toe of
an old sock believe that it is possible
for a strong man to earn his bread
and butter by counting dollars?
"You must have had a hard, day,"
said the reporter, noticing the worn
expression on his face.
"No," he answered, "this is an or
dinary morning's work. It's 3 o'clock
now, and I haven't had a bite to eat.
I go to lunch whenever there Is a lull
in business. There isn't much work
there," said he with a smile, Â¦ as the
reporter glanced at the pile of bills,
notes and coins on the counter. "It
doesn't take long to balance the cash
and then I'll check up all the notes
that have been paid in to-day, assort
the money and then I'm through."
"Do you ever have any trouble in
striking a balance?"
"Not often, and I pity the receiving
teller who does. The layman has no
Idea of the vexation of the reviewing of
accounts. It's the most fatiguing work
in the world. It means a constant men
tal effort. Have you ever noticed how
few men there are In banks with full
thick suits of hair? I haven't any au
thority for the notion, but I believe it's
due more or less to wprrying over ac
counts and books that refuse to bal
ance. Of course, a man is often out a
few dollars, but that does not give him
a great deal of annoyance. It's the big
sums that bring the headaches and
the breakdowns."
"What do you do with the dirty mon
ey and the defaced money?"
"Why, there's a knack of picking out
the old bills as you count a lot of
money. You get on to it after a little
and it becomes mechanical. The Gov
ernment gives the bank new bills for
old." . â¢;.Â¦;Â¦
"None of these checks has been in
dorsed," said the teller, handing the
bank* book back to the clerk.
"Take this deposit, will you?" said
a smart old man of business, in a
check suit and wearing white mutton
chop whiskers. The sign "Closed"
was staring him in the face as he
passed the money under the barred
gate of me receiving teller's window,
but the long suffering man said: "I'll
accommodate you this time, sir, if
you will make It a rule in future to
come before 3 o'clock." "Very well,"
said the old fellow in a tone that
clearly meant "all that I want is to
get thi3 money 4n the bank."
"Here's half a dozen blank bcroks with
some deposits. Write tnem up as soon
as possible. I'll be back after lunch,"
remarks the 15-year-old office boy.
"He's got his nerve with him all right,
all right," comments the fat man from
the rear of the line.
"After you balance my book and en
ter this deposit." said a lady, "send it
to Cumberland Cottage, De Lancy
street. New" â
"I'll enter the deposit." said the teller,
'but you'll have to leave all instruc
tions with the passbook clerk."
"I can't take these, sir," said the
teller to a gentleman. "These cou
pons don't mature until November."
"Let me see. Is it possible. I cut the
wrong coupons? Yes, I did, for a fact.
But, say, teller, you know me. Can't
you fix this up anyhow?"
"No, cir; it's utterly impossible."
"What! Only 3 per cent? My friend.
Colonel Brown, tells me you pay 4 per
cent. Don't deceive me, young man."
"No, madam. We pay only 3 per cent.
Formerly all banks paid 4 per cent,
now you'll find the uniform rate is
what we give."
â¢â¢Well, I expect I'll have to go some
where else."
"Teller, let me see my deposit slip for
May 7. My balance is short $3 28.
You've made an error, and see what
trouble It is Riving me."
"What do all these marks mean
alongside of every item?" said the de
positor when the slip was handed him.
"That shows that the other teller as
well as myself has verified this
amount."
'"I want to deposit the Interest on
this account for the last month," you'll
hear some fellow say.
"Go down to the passbook clerk at
the window to the right."
It was pay. day and a reporter
had occasion to make a deposit in a
local bank. Seeing the various types
of people standing before the window
of the receivine teller he scented a
story and forgot his mission. It is a
wonderful sight to watch a receiving
teller of a big bank plying his trade.
Wonderful that men can acquire such
facility in the intricate ways we have
of doing our business and wonderful
none the lees the coolness with which
foolish questions are always asked.
"What interest do you pay on de
posits?" asked a grandmother dressed
in grav colors.
"Three per cent, madam."
"My last observation was made at a
height of 29,000 feet at 1:54, when we
were ascending. 1000 feet per minute,
and when I resumed observations we
were .descending 2000 feet per minute.
These two positions must be connected,
taking into * account the interval be
tween them, 13 minutes. And on these
considerations the balloon must have
attained an altitude of 36,000 or 37,000
feet. Mr. Coxwell, on coming from the
ring, noticed ' that the center of the
aneroid barometer, its blue hand, and
a rope attached to the car were all on
the same straight line, and this gave a
reading of seven Inches, and leads to
the same result. Therefore, these in
dependent means' all come to about the
same elevationâ fully seven miles."
Coxwell has given his own account of
this adventure. "Never," he says,
"shall 1 forget those painful moments
of doubt and /suspense as to Mr.
Glalsher's state when no response came
to my questions. I began to fear that
he would never take any more read
ings." In the descent the aeronaut
states that they fell 19,000 feet in a
"While powerless I heard the words
'temperature* and 'observation,' and I
knew Mr. Coxwell was in the car
speaking to and endeavoring to raise
me, therefore consciousness and hear
ing had returned. I then heard him
speaking more emphatically, but could
not see, speak or move. I heard him
say again: 'Do try, now. do.' Then the
Instruments became dimly visible, and
Mr. Coxwell. and very shortly I saw
clearly. I said to Mr. Coxwell. 'I have
been insensible;' he said, 'You have,
and I, too, very nearly.* He told me he
had lost the use of his hands, which
were black, and I poured brandy over
them. Mr. Coxwell told me that while
in the ring he felt it piercingly cold,
and on attempting to leave the ring he
found his hands frozen. He had there
fore to place his arms on the ring and
drop down. He wished to approach me,
but could not, and when he felt insensi
bility coming over him, too, he became
anxious to open the valve. But in con
sequence of having lost the use of his
hands he could not do this; ultimately
he succeeded by seizing the cord with
his teeth and dipping his "head two or
three times, until the balloon took a de
cided turn downward. The descent took
place at Cole Weston, seven and a half
miles from Ludlow."
Thus one of the aeronauts was in
sensible and the other had only the
use of his teeth left with which to open
the valve and on that their safety de
pended. The height to which they had
attained is without parallel. Mr.
Glaisher says:
HEIGHT OF ASCENT.
RETURNING POWER.
"Shortly after I laid my arm. upon the
table, possessed of its full vigor, but on
being desirous of using it I found it
powerless. Trying to move the other
arm I found it powerless al<?o. Then I
tried to shake myself, and succeeded,
but seemed to have no limbs. In look
ing at the barometer my head fell over
my left shoulder. I struggled and
shook my body again, but could not
move my arms. Getting my head up
right, for an instant only, it fell on my
right shoulder; then I fell backward,
my back resting against the side of
the car and my head on its edge. Inr
this position my eyes were directed to
Mr. Coxwell in*the ring. When I shook
my body I seemed to have full power
over the muscles of the back, and con
siderably so over those of the neck, but
none over either my arms or my legs.
As in the case of the arms, so all mus
cular power was lost in an instant from
my back and neck. I dimly saw Mr.
Coxwell. and endeavored to speak, but
could not. In an instant intense dark
ness overcame me, so that the optic
nerve had suddenly lost power, but I
was still conscious, with as active a
brain as at the present moment while
writing this. I thought I had been
seized with asphyxia, and believed I
should experience nothing more, as
death would come unless we speedily
descended. Other thoughts v.ere en
tering my mind, when I became un
conscious as on going to sleep. I can
not tell anything of the sense of hear
ing, as no sound reaches the ear to
break the perfect stillness' and silence,
of 'the regions between six and seven
miles from the earth. My last obser
vation was at 1:54, above 29,000 feet.
The well-known meteorologist, James
Glaisher, who died in England last
winter, has left a full and corrected ac
count of his historic balloon ascent.
made in 1862, when he reached the high
est altitude ever attained by man. His
first ascent, with Coxwell. was made
from Wolverhampton on Ju+y-17, 1S62.
They rose to a height of five miles,
traveled sixty miles in two hours and
descended Just in time to avoid a dip
in "the Wash. Two important things
were learned on the excursion â first,
they passed through a cloud SOOO feet
in thickness and so dense that the bal
loon was invisible from the car; and,
second, they dropped 3900 feetâ from
16,300 to 12,400 feetâ in one minute. But
the great historic ascent, made from
Wolverhampton, took place on Septem
ber 5, 1862. when the highest point ever
attained by men who survived to tell
the tale was reached. Mr. Glaisher re
lates:
"At 1:51 the barometer read 10.8
inches. About 1:52 or later I read the
dry bulb thermometer as minus five
degrees; after this I could not see the
column of mercury nor the hands of
the watch nor the fine divisions on any
instrument. I asked Mr. Coxwell to
help me read the instruments. In con
sequence, however, of the rotary mo
tion of the balloon, which had contin
ued without ceasing since we left the
earth, the valve line had become en
tangled and he had to leave the car
and mount into the ring to readjust
it. I then looked at the barometer and
found its reading to be 9% inches, still
decreasing fast, implying a height ex
ceeding 29,000 feet.

to the indisposition of the Russian Min

$2500. It is to-day worth nearly five
times that amount. The news of this
sale caused great excitement, not alone
in New Jersey, but throughout the
country, and the search for pearls was
prosecuted with ardor in all favorable
spots. Millions of unios were gathered
at Notch Brook and elsewhere and de
stroyed, generally with little or no re
sult. One pearl, a large round one.
weighing over 400 grains, was the
greatest find, but it was ruined by boil
ing to open the shell. During this ex
citement nearly $15,000 worth of pearls
came to New Tork from nearly every
State in the Union. The excitement
gradually died away, owing mainly to
the Civil War, but it was somewhat re
vived in 1868. when many fine pearls
were obtained from Little Miami River,
Ohio.
There was another pearl excitement
in 1876, when some of the finest Ameri
can pearls were found near Wayncs
ville, Ohio.
THE PEARL STATES.
Since 1SS0 pearls have come from
comparatively new districts farther
West and South, and in a few years
Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas became
the principal pearl producing States.
One "sky blue" pearl from Caney Fork,
Tenn.. was sold for $350. and subse
quently brought $3300 in London.
' During the summer of 1883 a quan-'
tity of magnificently colored pearls
were found in the creeks and rivers of
Wisconsin. In Rock. Green, Lafayette.
Grant and Crawford counties. One of
these pearls sold for over $300, and
some among them were equal to any
ever found fc-r beauty and coloring.
They were principally purplish red.
copper red and dark pink. These dis
coveries led to increased activity in this
region, and by 1830 it had extended .
through other portions of Wisconsin,
and appeared also In Illinois, along the
Mackinaw River and its tributary
creeks, in McLean. Tazewell and Wood
ford counties. The pearl fisheries of
Wisconsin have produced nearly $300,000
worth of pearls since 1S83.
The excitement subsided in a few *
seasons, as the others had done in turn
before, by the exhaustion of the mussel
beds. A peculiar feature of this fever
for pearl hunting is that it seems to run
in cycles of ten years each.

"Straightway to cakewalk went the

way after them went their inane, brain
less troop of male followers. A moving
panorama of unbridled levity and un

decencies, become the one absorbing
topic of the hour. Even skirt prancing,
the 'FOlit.' and the leap frog cotillon

"To the American smart woman so

can be made the playground for riotous
display; how social functions can be
turned into wild orgies or undignified
romps; to fancy dress a charity; to
flaunt a bazaar; to self-advertise a hos
pital. These are the things we have
learned from our trans-Atlantic smart

an absolute craze, the first law of their

liable to attain a greater height at
any time.
'Five million live eggs have already
been shipped to the State hatchery at

After deliberating all night a jury
thl3 morning brought in a verdict of
guilty of burglary in the first degree
against Charles T. Gaylor. charged with
breaking into the home of Professor
W. Wilkinson of Berkeley. The case
was an unusual one and this was Gay
lor*s second trial for, the offense, the
jury at the first trial falling to agree
upon a verdict.
Gaylor was found a little after mid
night In the Wilkinson home. He was
located In a closet, where he attempted
to secrete himself. He was locked In.
the police were summoned and he was
taken from his hiding place to jail. At
his trial he pleaded that he was In an
alcoholic trance and knew nothing of
what he had done. Certain phases of
the case so impressed the Juries that
one failed to agree and the other took
fifteen hours to finally reach a conclu
sion in the matter. Gaylor tunÂ»ed on
all the lights in the house and so far
as could be discovered had disturbed
nothing and his conduct was so queer
generally that the prosecution had
mucn difficulty in securing his convic
tion.
He will be sentenced a week from
Monday.
EVENTS IN SOCIETY
The Spanish explorers who accom
panied De Soto in his memorable ex
pedition from Florida to the Missis
sippe in 1540, gave many remarkable
accounts of the pearls seen and pro
cured from the natives with whom
they came In contact In their extensive
wanderings through the regions of the
Gulf States, and a hundred years later
some of the English colonists made
reference to a similar kind in their ac
counts of the more northern tribes. As
these early settlers were kept quite
busy with more pressing matter, little
attention was paid to the search for
pearls until about forty-three years
aco. In 1847 a pearl of fine luster,
weighing* ninety-three grains, was
found at Notch Brook, near Paterson.
N. J. It subsequently became known
as the '"Queen Pearl," and was sold to
the Empress Eugenie of France for
Many oddly shaped pearls are found.
Elongated flshlike forms found near the
hinge of the shell and called "hinge ba
roque pearls" are abundant. Others,
with a slight addition of gold and enam
el, may be made to represent human
and animal heads, bat and bird wings
and similar objects. A pearl was found
in this country that strikingly resem
bled the bust of Michael Angelo. In a
few instances small fishes and crabs
which entered the shell have been im
prisoned and covered eventually with
nacre, thus making pearls of them, at
the same time retaining the animal's
shape. \
Frequently pearls have an opaque
appearance and seem to be worthless,
but on the removal of their outer layer
are found to be clear and iridescent.
The outer layer may be removed by
dipping them in a weak solution of
acid, which dissolves the opaque coat
ing, or it may be peeled with a knife,
like an onion, although this is hazard
ous, as sometimes the pearl is not of
the same material throughout and can
not be restored after being peeled.
Examinations which have been made
of some of the mounds of the Missis
sippi Valley, particularly In the Miami
and Scioto valleys in Ohio, have re
vealed the fact that the long forgotten
race that erected these remarkable
structures gathered and used the
fresh water pearls to an astonishing
extent. Bushels of pearls have been
found on the hearths of some of these
Ohio mounds. These are, of course,
worthless, as they have been damaged
and half decomposed by centuries of
burial and by the heat of sacrificial
fires. An idea of the quantity found in
certain of theso mounds may be gath
ered from the fact that all the pearls
which have been found in the recent
years of search and excitement wculd
not approach in numbers those found
in any one of these mounds. It Is prob
able that the mound builders used the
mussels for food, and thus naturally
accumulated large numbers of pearls,
which were probably used for orna
ments.
SPANISH EXPLORATIONS.
ODD SHAPES.
Pearls are of several distinct kinds,
differing in shape and perhaps in ori
gin. "Free" pearls, those that are
found loose and separate, between the
folds or layers of the mantle and gills,
or between the latter and the body of
the mullusk, comprise most of the true
spherical pearls, as also many that are
ovate, pear shaped and irregular. Then
there are the pearls found between the
mantle *nd the valves of the- shell;
these, if free at all. are apt to be hemi
spherical, or in any case flattened on
the side toward the shell, while often
they are attached more or less to the
valve by a deposit of the pearly secre
tion. In the region of the hinge these
become extremely irregular in shape
and often greatly elongated, forming a
third kind, known as hinge pearls, ba
roques, etc.
The freshwater pearls differ from the
marine pearls In their greater variety
of tints and in the partial transparency
of their nacre. In color the freshwater
pearls present an extended series of
shades, from s dead opaque white, hav
ing little' value, through various tints
of pink, yellow and salmon, or a faint
purple, passing to a bright red.\ so close
ly resembling a drop of molten copper
as almost to deceive the eye. Some are
very light green and brown, others rose
color and still others are pale steel
blue, russet and purplish brown. In
addition to their color and luster they
are beautifully iridescent, and at times
the white and pink pearls are more lus
trous than even the best oriental pearls.
For some years pearls have been
steadily increasing in value, and for
the best varieties outrank the diamond
in value. This increased value is ac
counted for by the fact that the supply
Is far from equal to the demand, while
the demand has been largely caused by
the dictate of fashion. Formerly ma
rine pearls furnished four-fifths of the
available supply, but these fisheries
have gradually fallen off until now they
produce only about three-fifths of the
yearly yield, the rest being made up of
fresh water pearls, a considerable part
of which are found here.
In this country fresh water pearls are
generally found in bivalve shells of the
family unlonidae, also known as the
naiades. These mussels are most
abundant in swift and clear water,
where the bottom is sandy or gravelly
and the country rock calcareous. The
pearls found are few, and those of mar
ket value represent the destruction of
thousands of mussels for every one ob
tained. The soft internal parts of these
mollusks are covered by a thin, delicate
membrane, called the mantle, from the
surface and particularly from the outer
edges of which material is excreted to
from the inner layers of the shell.
Whenever by accidental Injury, disease
or intrusion of foreign substances local
irritation is set up in these tissues the
effect is to produce an Increased secre
tion of the nacreous matter at this
point, resulting in the formation of
pearls or pearly concretions.
KINDS OF PEARLS.
Anna Ross, a young white woman,
was sentenced this morning by Judge
Ellsworth to spend the remainder of
her life at Folsom State prison for the
murder of Mrs. Leroy, an old colored
woman. She broke down and cried
upon hearing ner doom pronounced and
then asked the Judge to allow her to
see her child before the bar^ closed
upon her forever.
The Judge told the Sheriff that if this
could be conveniently done her wish
might be gratified. As it is understood
that there are no women at Folsom the
Prison Directors may have to transfer
her to San Quentin.
Anna Ross was the consort of Victor
WaJkirez, a mulatto. The pair lived
with an old colored woman, Mrs. Eliza
beth Leroy, at Golden Gate. On the
night of May 5 last the old woman was
murdered for her money by being
struck on the head with a hammer and
a clothes line was then wound tightly
around her throat. The body was bur
ied in a shallow grave under the house
where she lived. A month later the
Ross woman told the police of the deed
and pointed out to them where the
body lav hidden.
Walklrez was tried, found guilty of
the murder and sentenced to life im
prisonment in San Quentin. His de
fense was that he was drunk and did
not remember having committed the
crime. The woman said that while she
saw the murder committed it was done
against her will. After the conviction
of the negro did all he could to con
vict his companion and succeeded.

ALAMEDA, Dec. 19. â Jurymen
from abroad, particularly Oakland,
are not wanted In Alameda to assist
local residents in settling their trou
bles in the courts here and City Jus
tice R. B. Tappan told Constable
George E. Clapke that much this morn
ing during the trial of Charles Powell,
a contractor, who had been accused
by Gottleib Schumacher of hauling
sand from a beach on the south side
that is claimed by the defendant.
In rounding up possible talesmen.
Constable Clarke Included in the ve
nire J. A. Schotsaw, an Oaklander
whom the official met on Park street.
When the man from across the estu
ary appeared In court and was asked
where he lived he surprised the attor
neys and magistrate by answering
that he hailed from the Athens of the
Pacific.
"Well, what are you doing in this
court then?" queried Justice Tappan.
Schotsaw replied that he was cap
tured by Constable Clarke while
strolling along Park street and served
with, a summon; to be on hand at 9
o'clock.
"During the twenty years that I
have practiced law in this town." said
his Honor, "I have always noticed
that there has been an ignorance on
the part of many Constables as to
what their duties are. In the first
place, they should" be careful to find
out where a man lives. We cannot
compel an Oakland' citizen to come
here and listen to our bickerings. We
have troubles enough without letting
outsiders know of them. You are ex
cused, Mr. Schotsaw, and may con
tinue your stroll along Park street. If
you are held up again by a local Con
stable tell him you are from greater
Oakland, or come to me."
An examination disclosed the fact
that the telephone wire had become
overcharged through coming in con
tact with a trolley line some distance
away. The powerful current burned
out the instrument and set the room
wherein It was stationed on fire. Line
men were summoned after the flames
were conquered and the dangerous
wire was removed from the residence.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 19. â Regardless of
the danger of being electrocuted, Mrs.
George Murphy of 1315 ,Oak street
bravely battled with flames that were
ignited by. highly charged and sputter
ing telephone wires in her home last
evening. While endeavoring to sub
due the fire and pull the blazing in
strument from the wall she was se
verely seared and shocked. When as
sistance reached her she was in a
state of collapse and for a time it was
feared that her injuries were serious.
Mr. and Mrs. Albert G. Evans, who
occupy the residence with Mrs. Mur
phy, became cognizant of the accident
through Mrs. Murphy's screams for
help. They rescued her from the
apartment that was filled with smoke
and fire and succeeded after much ef
fort in extinguishing the fire.

Jar=es F. Massey of San Francisco,
formerly employed as a conductor for
the Southern Pacific Company, was ar
rested to-day on a charge of felony
embezzlement by H. S. Walker, attor
ney for the United Brotherhood of
Railway Employes, who charges that
Massey withholds some $410 belonging
to the organization. Massey's story is
that the brotherhood owes him money
and he Elrnc'y withheld the money to
protect himself, having no criminal in
tent.
The trouble between Massey and the
brotherhood originated in an advertis
ing pamphlet for which Massey solic
ited advertisements. Massey agreed
cct to collect the money for the ad
vertisement*, but last night the offi
cers cf the brotherhood learned that
he had already secured payments from
merchants- amounting to $410. He was
called upon for an explanation this aft
ernoon in Attorney Walker's office, but
evidently his explanation was not sat
isfactory, for he was arrested and turn
ed over to the police. When searched
at the City Prison $410 in checks and
cash was found in his pockets.
"I diin't intend to steal any money,"
eaid Masaey. "I kept what I collected
esid intended to turn it over to the
brotherhood when I had arranged a
settlement. The brotherhood owes me
mere money than was found In my
pockets."
The bas*a for Massey's arrest was a
complaint for felony embezzlement is
eued from Judge Cabaniss' court in San
Francisco to-day, the warrant being
served upon him in Jail.

ular subscriptions, has been sent from
Dresden to Countess von Montignoso,
formerly the Crown Princess of Sax
ojiy, who in December, 1901, eloped
with M. Giron. One of the motives of
the subscribers appears to have been
a d-y?ire to show dislike for the Saxon
royal house.

W. C. Mills, an ex-soldier, attempted
to murder his wife, Mabel J. Mills, last
night in the Camp Fire Dance Hall, a
notorious Pacific street resort, by-firing
one shot at her from a 22-caliber target
revolver. The bullet missed its mark
and before the murderously inclined
husband could fire a second time he
was seized and placed under arrest by
Patrolmen Holmes and Sskain. .
. Mills was married to the woman
whose life he attempted seven years
ago in Fresno. He left her and enlisted
in the army four years ago and was
discharged last January after return
ing from the Philippines. He has been
persistently annoying the woman since
that time. Last night about 8 o'clock
he visited her in the dance hall, and
demanded that she return to him. This
the woman refused to do and thereupon
Mills declared that she would go with
him or on a stretcher. 5

KING EDWAKD MAKES
J^N UNPOPULAR MOVE
Two Famous American Members of
the Royal Academy Checkmate
Britain's Ruler.
LONDON. Dec. 19. â How J. S. Sar
gent and Edwin A. Abbey, the two fa
mous American members of the Royal
Academy, recently, managed to upset
a pet project of King Edward's can be
told for the first time on the authority
of a Royal Academician. It seems
that the King was especially anxious
to have Emil Fuchs, the portrait
painter, made a -number of the acad
emy, and that Sargent and Abbey
found means of preventing the royal
wish from' being carried out. Ever
since Fuchs designed the new postage
stamps, which bear the King's head â
and which most people ' think any
thing but artistic â and made the
drawings for the coronation medal,
Edward VII is said to have been re
markably "keen" on him, and the
sovereign has spent a lot of time in
the artist's studio in Devonshire street.
Not long ago it popped into the
royal head that Fuchs ought, to be a
Royal Academician and the result
was a letter to the famous society of
Burlington House to the effect that
his Hajesty would be pleased to see
the appointment made. That letter
made trouble. According to the in
formant, the of the Royal
Academy did not think Fuchs entitled
to become one of their number, but
they were in no end of a quandary as to
how they could get out of making the
appointment without offending the
King. In their perplexity, however,
some of the more prominent academi
cians went to Messrs. Sargent and Ab
bey and asked for a suâestion. which
was promptly given.
The two American artists, who, of
course, are quite the biggest guns in
the English art world at present,
promptly sat down and wrote to the
King stating: that if Mr. Fuchs rras
LONDON'. Dec. 19.â There was tha
usual animated gathering of Ameri
cans to eat turkey with the r*al cran
berry sauce and finish c<l \ :'h real
pumpkin pie at the American Soci
ety's Thanksgiving banquet. Mr.
Choate, referring to William Jennings
Bryan, who was the chief guest of the
evening, had a little sly fun with the
ex-advocate of free silver. He said
he had taken him to -the Bank of Eng
land, where he could make a special
study of finance and currency, a sug
gestion that evoked great laughter
and cheers. Mr. Bryan, he said, was
making a tour of inquiry and had sat
at the feet of Asquith and Chamber
lain and Goschen and Rosebery, and
if his ideas on the fiscal question
having heard all those gentlemen in
the space of about forty-eight hours
were not a little mixed, they would
appreciate what qualities the man
had. "We are delighted to welcome
this famous orator." said the Ambas
sador in conclusion, "this candidate
twice over of a great party â to whicfl
perhaps we do not all belong â this
honest man whose purity of character
and unbounded cheerfulness of temper
have disarmed even his political ad
versaries of all personal hostility."
Mr. Bryan got' back by telling: Mr.
Choate that If he were to give, full
credit to what the Er^bassador had
salty he might be in the position of the
young lady whose sweetheart praised
her until she felt so bis that she
would not apeak to him.

ROME. Dec. 19.â Although the real
celebration of Christmas, with the ex
change of gifts, comes, for the
majority of Italian children, on
the *Ep'phany, leaving December 25
an entirely religious day. the royal
family keep Christmas as do other
countries. This is a tradition in the
House of Savoy which the present
King and Queen have maintained.
At court all is movement and life at
Christmaptide. Both King and Queen
Personally select the valuable presents
they give to the members of their
households. This year Queen Helene
will take peculiar pains in choosing an
infinity of gifts, as it is said she gave
dissstirfaction last year, through an
innocent judging of other people by
hcrseif.
One of her greatest weaknesses is
children. She aÂ£ores her own, loves
those of her ladies-in-waiting, and has
a more than kindly feeling for all
young people as such, even extending
her affection to the eldest son of the
Duke of Aosta, who will some time sit
on the throne of Ii !y. if Queen Hel
ene has no beys. In the general
course of human nature she would
not feel very friendly toward him â
and in fact she did not in the begin
ning â but he conquered her as a
baby, and that meant forever.
Last year the Queen thought she
could not please her ladies-in-waiting
better than by pleasing their little
ones, so she arranged a magnificent
Christmas tree, which she hung with
everything that the infant heart
could desire, the presents being costiy
and numerous, but there were only
trif.es for the parents. This was too
much; the lament? were longandloud,
and reached the ears of the poor
Queen, who had intended so well and
had satisfied fo ill. With her one les
son is su?Hcient, so that this season the
gifts are to be many and beautiful,
but strictly for the mammas.
PRESENTS ARE COSTLY.
The giving of the presents form a
regular ceremonial. They nre all ar
ranged on various tables. There are
jewels for the wives of those decorated
with the collar of the Annunciata,
wives of Cabinet Ministers, and ladies
in-waiting. Each present has a card
attached, on which is written the
r.ame of the person for whom it is in
tended. The. Cour.tes3 Giucciardini,
the chief lady-in-waiting of her Ma
jesty, has a large book in which she
has written every scar a list of the
presents given by both the King and
Queen, and the names of their recipi
ents. In this way the giving of dupli
â¢ cate gifts is avoided. The ladies-in
waiting wear the jewels presented
them by her Majesty for the first
time at the reception given by the
diplomatic corps, on the evening of
the last day of the year.
Besides this "intimate reception"
for the bestowing of gifts, there are
innumerable others, so that the sea
â¢ con is considered at court to be the
most fatiguing of the whole year.
This year there is to be an entirely
intimate Christmas tree for the little
Princesses Yolanda and Mafalda, the
former being not yet three, and the
latter having just completed her first
year. Christmas to the babies is one
long laugh, beginning with the mo
ment they open their eyes in the
morning, until they close them at
night The first thing they see is
some mirth-provoking object, placed
so as to catch their attention. Last
year Princess Yolanda found a "nig
ger" doll sitting on her pillow, and
when she moved it it stuck out its
tongue. She laughed and laughed un
til her nurse obliged her to stop, and
then she clasped the new treasure to
her besom and flew to papa and
mamma. After breakfast, during the
morning, the shutters were closed and
the electric lights turned on, so that

colored electric globes and laden with

ehone in full glory to the view of the
cj/en-mouthed children.
QCEEX AS SANTA CLAUS.
Ibis year the tree will be smaller
and the Queen herself will act as Santa
Claus. Their Majesties themselves re
ceive no gifts outside the family cir
cle. It is not permited; but those who
feel special gratitude to them, or
from their rank are near the throne,
have got into the habit of sending the
babies remembrances, which are ac
cepted.
On the whole the day of Christmas
at the Quirinal is strictly private, a
"home" day, where the servants are
made glad also', and where the chil
dren are the chief consideration. As
the years go on anil the Princesses are
older, and there are perhaps others,
more Will be made of this "holy day,"
but it will always be entirely intimate.
Their Majesties' follow the national '
custom of a fish dinner on Christmas
eve. /The day before Christmas, as
before any great church festival, is a
fast or "lean" day (as the Italians call
it), that is to say, a day on which no
meat may be touched. But with the
usual ingeniousness of the nation, in
stead of being regarded as a day of
fast, it is seized upon as an occasion
for feasting, elaborate and costly ft'sh
dinners being now the invariable
rule.
The typical Roman spends the night
before Christmas in merry company,
generally, playing "tombola," a kind
of lottery, and about one o'clock of
the morning of the 24th the entire
party adjourn to the fish market,
where there is a magnificent display of
the fish, to be sold later on, immense
eels being the most conspicuous. The
dinner in the evening, which begins
about nine, so that it will finish Just
when the hour arrives for midnight
mass, is composed entirely of fish
soup, and fish fried, boiled, baked, etc.,
with tomato sauce and cauliflower.
Although the King and Queen do not
Rave the palace, they adhere to this
programme more or less closely. This
is followed on Christmas day by a
magnificent and elaborate banquet,
which, however has no invariable
dish, such as our American turkeys.

to have withdrawn his request with

The English royal family really gets
a lot of fun out of Christmas, owing to
the number of grandchildren, grand
nephews and grandnieces for whom
presents have to be chosen with that
care and thought for personal prefer
ences that makes it more pleasant to
give than to receive. The King's big
country house at Sandringham will be

The chief Interest of the local week

with a holiday spectacle entitled
"Ixlon." "Ixion" is a home-made af

pretentious, of the Christmas specta
cles so popular at the old house. Most
of the old favorites, and some new

There will be 150 people In the cast,
that will include, as usual, several
clever children. The ballets will be of
unusually ambitious order and the
scenic appointments fit and splendid.
Old Tivoll prices will prevail.
The fact that the house was sold out
for the opening: performance In one
morning demonstrates the San Fran

tism of the new Tivoli. The manage
ment will have to work hard to come
up to the local expectations for the
new house. As the old Tivoli has made
history for us. the new Tivoll is ex
pected to make history, and it cannot
be of tco exalted sort to fulfill the local
expectations. There has been an evo
lution of standards proceeding by leaps
and bounds and to keep pace with.it

tainly the possession of the prettiest
and, next to the Grand Opera-house,
most spacious house in town, as well
as what promises to be as acoustically

Plenty of Bright
Attractions for the Â£
Holiday Season
The Arnold Dolmetsch divorce, an ar
tistic catastrophe, has changed the
plans of the Twentieth Century Club
for its aiming season. The club had
planned to brine out these . artists of
the old world of music- for their, next
"Parsifal" ad nauseam! It seems
probable Just now that if one were
to drop in upon the lamas in the re
motest lamassery .of remote Thibet
they would be found talking "Parsifal."
The subject has been thrashed out from
every side. Every one has been in at
the thrashingâ except Herr Conried,
who is busy producing the opera. And
everybody has also been thrashed.
Mme. Wagner is regarded variously as
an absurd idealist, as a dog in the
manger and also as a martyr. In the
latter role she has Lohengrins by the
score for her defense. Herr Conried
occupies the other side of the see-saw.
With those with whom Mme. Wagner is
aloft Herr Conried is aground, and
oppositely. Between these two are the
singers and the public. By the Wag
ner household the loyalty of the Bay
reuth singers to Wagner's supposed de
sire to have the opera sung there only
has been movingly appealed to. The
Conried forces appeal to the singers on
the larger ground of spreading the ar
tistic gospel. Both sides are accused of
fomenting the discussion for the pur
poses of advertisement.
Nor is the matter confined to musical
circles. On the ground of blasphemy â
Parsifal, the central figure of the opera,
being in some sort a representation of
the Christ, some of the churches have
now taken a hand in denouncing Mr.
Conried's production of the opera in
New York. So the war goes merrily on.
But Gustave Hinrichs â once of our
Tivollâ is none the less busy rehearsing
the oDera at the Metropolitan for its
production on the 26th, nor the rest of
the huge force at their various tasks.
The latest slaÂ» is at the public that
will hear "Parsifal," administered bru
tally by the Berlin Wagner Society.
The society has published a manifesto
recently that declares that "Richard
Wagner's holy legacy to art, whose pro
duction he designed to reserve for the
consecrated /temple of art which he
created, Is tnrown away upon auditors
in the land of dollars, who possess no
conception of the true essence of Wag
ner and probably never will possess
any."
Meantime, possibly tj permit the
odious comparison to be made by "audi
tors in the land . of possibly
again to lay "consecrated" hands upon
some of the dollars, tne Bayreuth so
ciety has issued for American circula
tion the following programme of the
Bayreuth festival fof 1904. It will be
seen that "Parsifal" plays a more than
usually prominent , part, and that
"Lohengrin.'.' . "Die Meistersinger" and
the "Flying Dutchman" are entirely

I found Mr. Hart foxily saving him
self trouble by dictating letters to .the
hotel stenographer. She seemed to be
enjoying It, but as she didn't tell me
why, I can't tell you. It augured well.
1 owever. The business of comedy sits
bo seriously upon the usual comedian's
brow that interviewing him is as wildly
festive an affair as being a lost dog.
Mr. Hart I found soberly cheerful,
with a vein of fun not too far under the
surface and â but we anticipate.
"I wish Mrs. Hart were here," "Joe"
begran. a? he. the artist and I flew heav
enward in the California Hotel elevator.
We stopped at the sixth floor and found
our 'way quickly to the Hart domain.
Our host continued: "Hope you don't
mind the smell of gasoline. I dropped
off a bicycle the other day and hit Cali
fornia pretty hard. My boy has been
cleaning it off." and the farceur apolo
getically removed the leg gear that
draped the back of my chair.

peated: "Awfully sorry Mrs.. Hart
Isn't h* re. You gave her a whole page
when we were here before â do you re
member? ~'A like her to be in this."
"Would it be. nicer (for you) if I
were to put ber in, Mr. Hart?" I
laughed.
"Perhaps." he grinned, "but I think
it would be nicer for you, too."
"Net a doubt of It! I hope she'll
come in."
Here's with a merry Christmas from
Foxy Grandpa! As one r." j contributes
aboundingly to the season's festivity he
has prrhaps more right than most of
us to the wish. Obviously Foxy is the
person of the week. Others may be
Glasers. but these are of the flowers
that bloom in the spring tra la. Foxy
is a r>lum pudding. He is a whole

oysters, icecream, cranberries â all you
want of everything without repentance.
Therefore as a wholesome Christmas

hoping as an entree to encounter Mrs.

bills.
on the road. Once you could take any
old thing if it had a New York label
and make good with it. Now you
might bring eighty carloads of scen
ery and you can't do anything with it
without your play is worth some
thing."
"What do you think the people
want â besides 110 cents on the dol
lar?" ,
"Musical comedy a good deal now,"
he replied. "They like music,- and
they don't want to think. They've
been thinking all day and they want to
get away from itâ that's the biggest
part of your audience. Bright music,
some little, sense/ a^ little plot, -some lit
tle contlnuity,';tbgether with cleanly
fun, and there you are. It's hard
earned money you get with the sugges
tive pointâ and not worth having. *j
"You've done a good deal with
farce yourself, haven'tyou,' Mr. Hart?"
"Oh, yes, some," he replied, modest
ly businesslike. "Girls wiir be girls,
and I wrote, in fact, most of the farces
we used when I was with Mr. Hallen."
"You compose, too?" "
"A little. I make up the tunes, some
one else orchestrates them."
"We seem to get the best farce mus
ical comedy from over the water."
"That's because we are not so care
ful here. Things are mostly just
thrown together lightly. The why and
wherefore isn't looked after. : Why,
I've* seen an actor permitted to leave
a door on one side of the stage and
come back immediately by an oppo
site door, and there .is a window b,e-"
twee'n them through which you can
see the ocean! He's been all round
it in two seconds! You can't do things
like that, you know. You must have
a reason for -everything."
"That, of course, belongs rather to
stage management."
"I'm a stage manager myself," mel-.
ancholy was uppermost here. '.'But
those foreign musical comedies now.
There's a half dozen men at the writ
ing of themâ one at the book, one or
two at the lyrics, another at the songs,
another for the orchestral end, and so
on. They don't expect one man to do
it all. And they do get results. There's
the 'Three Little Maids,' the success of
this year; all of those Daly comedies,
they're all good, workmanlike stuff and
â I wonder where Mrs. Hart is?" he
broke off.
"I don't wonder you're uneasy If she's
out shopping."
"That's Just It," her husband grinned,
and asked: "May I go to see if she is
in her sister's room? I really want you
to meet her. You know women talk so
much better than men."
"You'd better go," I warned him, and
sat and wondered where I had seen
Mr. Hart's like, with the good, blue
eyes, set far apart; the square, good
brow with .its sleek thatch; the . good
jaw and the comical smallish nose and
wide mouth that perhaps determined
him to comedy instead of to commerce
or politics. I gave it up, and fell again
to thinking how hard to jest through
tears for one's bread and butter. For
the comedian, on his sturdy 5 feet 6 or
so, wore black, the tie black, the sleeve
links also black.
He returned still wifeless a moment
later and then began to tell me how
he had run away from home at four
teen to go on the stage â though 'twas
to be excused as his. uncle, Josh Hart,
was lessee of the Boston Theater.
"I went with a man named De Lilly,
from Chicago. And he was a lily! I
was two weeks with him and one night
he said: 'If there's anything you want
in your trunk you'd better take it out
to-night. I'm going home.' I took my
banjo, and that trunk's still on the
border line of Maine somewhere."
"You got home,, though?"
"Yes, at '4 o'clock one morning, with
my banjo under my arm. Mother let
me In. I'd never even written to tell
her where I was. She only said: 'You
go to bed, now, sonny; we'll talk
"troupe" in the morning.' We did.
But I'd had a taste of It and I never
settled down . after that. I was in
vaudeville when I. was sixteen. I even
had a mustache then. Yes, sir. I used
to put it up in curlpapers because It
was too soft to stay up by its lonely.
You, should have seen.it on' wet days.
Dick Golden, Nat Goodwin, Henry
Dlxey. Francis . Wilson, were all in
"Yes, but â well," Hart decided,
thrusting his hands in his pockets,
"I don't think the managers have
been giving tha people what they
wanted. And what they want now, by
Jove â " Mr. Hart tlapped his knee to
emphasize â "is 110 cents on the dol
lar! But I'm sure anything they do
want they'll buy. It isn't a case of
financial shortage. It's because they
didn't want what the managers had to
sell. The theater's a luxury, not . a
necessity, and people are going to
look round before they buy. You
*an't force productions.' It's the same
"You're pretty wise to take sure
things round about election time,"
the comedian said. I remembered
then that Hart was not only a come
dian, but a successful manager; not
only a successful manager, but a suc
cessful writer of farce. It was the
manager talking. "There's too much
fun and business outside at election
time. A good deal of loose money
flying round, too; cigars and wine and
things. And when there's something
for nothing to be had something for
something is not going to be on top.
It is Just as well to postpone your
something until after November 2d."
"Times have been pretty bad late
ly with the theatrical brethren in the
East"
"Well, ain't . it surprising?" Hart
laughed, his eyes only a blue chink of
fun under their dapper eyebrows.
"Why. one night they're piping high
C's and the next they're rumbling down
in the basement, and big enough to put
grandpa over their kne'es!"
"How old are these boys?"
"Fourteen and sixteen, though they
don't look it. It Is difficult to get them
clever enough to catch on to the parts
and able to sing so as to be heard, and
yet young enough to create the illusion.
They're nice boys. Haying an awful
time just now, though. Their, mother
sent them a Christmas box, and to be
sure it got here early enough she sent
it this week. They're on their word of
honor not to open it. But at the pres-,
ent rate of whittling I don't see much
"of that box left for Christmas." â¢
"Lovely! I'd like to know the end," I
owned, then asked: "Weren't you at
the Orpheum the last time you were"
here ?"
"And the only time I've worked for
salary for a good many years," Mr.
Hart acquiesced.
"Mrs. Hart's sister was on at the
same time, I remember, Fleurette."
The comedian looked pleased at my
remembrance of his sister-in-law, and
observed: "Florrie almost always trav
els with us. Nice girl, good girl. You
know they're not a bit like people think
stage folks are. Religious, you know.
They leave me in bed every Sunday
morning and eo off to church â say my
"No. But I like it. Those traits are
something one should cultivate in one's
family. I encourage it all I can."
"Peer Gynt and his lady of the
prayer-book," I murmured.
"Let me tell you something pretty."
Hart said suddenly. His dark, rugged
face, the color of smoked ivory, and
quaintly askew in its drawing, was
almost shy here. "We were traveling
out to California and my wife and
sister-in-law had gone to dress one
morning and the old porter began to
make up their beds. But he' soon
stopped for some reason or other, and
then ho looked over at me with a
queer little smile and held up a cru
cifix and a little saintly picture my
wife carries around. She'd left them
in her berth. 'That's the sweetest
thing I've seen on this line for many
years, sir.' he said. 'Your wife and
sister, sir? You are a lucky man, par
don me, eir.' and the old gentleman
Just beamed. I think so, too," the
lucky man concluded.
I could only nod a convinced as-
Bent to the old gentleman's opinion,
and then I said: "Fleurette was danc
ing the last time I saw her."
"She is going: to appear in a mus
ical comedy of mine pretty shortly, I
think," Mr. Hart informed me, "not
until after the election, though." v-;;-/
"Does that make so much differ
ence ?"
'"We've one at home like them," I cor
rected. ' '
"But you will say something about
her?" he pleaded, "and It can't be too
much or too good."
"Well. I'm not superstitious about
most things, butâ" Mr. Hart's head
shook -solemnly to Indicate that birth
stones really counted. "It's my mas
cot, in fact."
He put up- his finger then to show
me a heavy gold ring. Foxy Grandpa
cleverly carved on one wing of it, the
boys on the other, and "Foxy Grand
pa" engraved in the center. "She had
that made for me, too," he said hap
pily.
"Don't forget my story, please," I
remind then.
"I'm out of snow," he be^an, teasing
ly. "Roses will doâ"
"Talking of roses, I did have a funny
sort of Christmas night here once.
Ought. to be ashamed -of it, too. I had
been out with a friend making Christ
mas vcallsâ after the show â and we
were walking down Geary street and
tossing;' up .whether to make for the
Hammkm baths or home.v^The baths
won -|he ; tos3â luckily. But we were
happy! how Jiappy we were! We
jfist owned ,that .block. Presently an
other fellow came along. â¢ He wasn't
striped our way. He had the look of a
man when the chips hadn't been com
ing his Â¦; way, utterly forlorn," and
Hart thrust up a pair, of desolate
shoulders to. illustrate. "Poor chap!
â¢ But It struck the' other owls on the
funny bone. We commenced to laugh,
and laughed, and couldn't stop. The
man just looked at us and said:
'Dâ n! I'd give a thousand dollars if
I had. a laugh coming to me like
that!' We wished him a merry Christ
mas, then, and I guess he wasn't any
the worse for it.
"More, please," I laughed.
"I'll tell you a little story, with all
â¢the snow you want â though it hadn't
anything to do with the case. I was
in Philadelphia one Christmas night,
snowing to beat the band, too," he be
gan, "and they told me when I got
down to the theater that there had
been a man waiting at the stage door
for. me for an hour before I came. I'd
gone in at "the front of the house, so
he'd missed me. I didn't pay any at
tention at first. We've so many people
come to see us about any old thing.
They come because they have sat in
front at Oshkosh â any reason's good
enough. They're something like those
London gamins, you know. The lit
tle chaps seem to spring out of the
gutter to open your cab doors, and
they don't say anything but "Thank
you, sir,' and hold out their poor little
claws. I remember one little beggar
who was too late to open the door,
but the imp put out his hand just the
same, and said, 'I saw you get out,
sir!' I put my hand in my pocket and
said: 'Here, it's worth it.' '..
"But the other fellow's still out In
the snow, Isn't he? He kept bothering
the people to see me until I sent my,
bov out to him. He asked his name
and what he wanted, but all the fel
low would say was. # 'Oh, Joe (!) doesn't
know me, but tell him it's very im
portant.' 'Fetch him in,' I told my boy
at last, and what do you think he
wanted? He explained between shiv
ers that he had seen me in front and
so 'was sure I'd help him out of a
hole,' that his friend' Billy had one of
his 'lamps' damaged and was due to
go to a Christmas party with his best
girl,' and that if I didn't let him have
some of the right kind of paint to hide
the damage explanations would be fn
order and Billy short on "best girls.'
He got the paint."
We left the comedian then, again re
gretting that we had not seen Mrs.
Hart. Â¦ :-v& ; &
eyes of it seemed to follow one's every
movement.
"That Is a cat's head," said Mr. Hart,
and he came over to show me how the
head opened, locket fashion, to show a
baby niece's portrait and that of his
wife, a piquant little face, wide-eyed
and laughing under its tangle of curls.
"She gave it to me. These are cats
eyes. My birthstone, you know."

to the "California Bodies" of the Val

building of a temple for these bodies
on the property -on Post street, oppo

issue 800 bonds of the par value of $100
each, with interest at 4 per cent, to
run ten years, the money- so derived to
be used as a building fund. The bonds
are to be subject to recall in such
amounts and at such time," from year

of the bodies will justify. If the bonds
are subscribed for and the payment
therefor shall be , 10 per cent of face

ceremonial pomp such as has never be
fore been witnessed in this order. It
was a grand object lesson to the offi
cers and members of the circle who
occupied the galleries, teaching them
how to conduct initiations in the circle
rooms. After the initiation of the can
didates and the proclamation by Grand
Arch Druidesa Louise Zazzi that the
strangers had been duly initiated into
the order through the several circles in
which they had placed application
there followed an address by the grand
arch druidess and dancing.
At a recent entertainment in Wash
ington Scuare Hall there was a vote
for the most popular drufdess and the
laziest druid in the hall. The prize for
the former was awarded to Frances J.
Horn and the latter to A. E. Hall, both
of Boadicca Circle.

Henry Mauser and Olive Ward. After
the proclamation there was presented
to Mrs. Atwood, the retiring matron,
a magnificent star set with six dia
monds in recognition of the most suc
cessful manner in which she conducted
the chapter during the time she pre
sided. Probably no officer has retired
this term from the office of matron with
better wishes for future prosperity in
life than Mrs. Atwood. Dr. Atxyood.
the retiring patron, "was remembered
by the chapter by the presentation to
him of a costly crystal ornament for
the home. The retiring matron and
patron then jointly presented the mem
bers of the retiring star a beautiful
painted souvenir, each bearing the
flower of the point represented during
the last year, the handiwork of Mrs.
Atwood who is an artist with the brush
of no mean merit. The ceremonies of.
the evening were followed by a social
hour.

Never in the history of the chapter
was the installation so well performed
as on that occasion, the charges of the
installing officer being delivered with
the proper expression and much feel
ing. At the close of the ceremony there
was an expression of regret at the re
tirement of Mrs. Gould from the office
of matron, she having not only served
well her own term, but the major por
tion of the term of Mrs. Mary Ella
Klein, who shortly after her installa
tion left this city for a tour of the
world. She was then presented a most
beautiful emblem of the order in the
shape of a diamond adorned star, and
in addition to this she was presented
several other tokens of fraternal es
teem. Adolph W. Beedle, the retiring
patron, was presented a patron's jewel.
Both officers responded feelingly. One
of the presents to Mrs. Gould was a
beautiful miniature picture from her
personal friends in the chapter. During
the evening Mrs. Klein rendered vocal
selections, which were received with
great applause and followed by the pre
sentation to her of a large bunch of
roses.
One of the most interesting installa
tions in the Eastern Star during the
season was that of the officers of Cali
fornia Chapter in Golden Gate Hall.
The work by the retiring matron was
in a manner tha^ won for her many
kind words of commendation. The
new officers are Isabella Woodside, ma

the termination of the principal event
of the evening Mrs. Mary Wittman. re
tiring matron, was. on behalf of the
chapter, presented- with a beautiful etar
cf the order set with large diamonds
and suspended from a bar of glittering
gems. H. D. Loveland. the retiring pa
tron, was presented â¢with a fine clock
in order that he may keep time on him
eelf. To the retiring members of the
central star the retiring matron pre
sented each a belt and buckle and to
each of the retiring officers the retiring
patron presented a highly decorated
cup and saucer as a souvenir of most
pleasant associations. Mrs. Woodside.
the new matron, has for same time
been a most earnest worker on behalf
of the chapter and she expects during
her term to extend its limits and add
much to the social feature. In this she
will be ably assisted by Dr. Boxton.

John Tcnningsen. a prominent mem

The installation of the officers of

tenson, the r^tirin^ matron, assisted
by Flora Mae McDonald. P. M.. as
marshal. Both received many words
of commendation for the dignity and
:mpressiveness in which they con
ducted the beautiful ceremonies. This
chapter on this occasion followed the
time established rule of having the
installation ceremony as part of the
business meeting and admitting only
members of the order. During the
evening there was read a communi
cation from the grand secretary, Kate
â¢ J. Wiilats. announcing that Mrs.
Christenson, the retiring matron, had
been appointed deputy district grand
matron for all the chapters of San
Francisco. The announcement was
received with loud applause, as every
member was pleased that the sterling
qualities of Mrs. Christenson had
been appreciated by the flowers of the
order. Under good of the order the
retiring matron was presented with a
costly, beautiful jewel, and Retiring
Patron Richard Herring was present
ed with a beautiful jewel of his rank.
This was followed by D. Oliver Jr.
presenting to Mrs. Christenson on be
half of the eisters and brothers, who
love her in a fraternal degree that
may have been equaled, but never ex
celled, a beautifully decorated choc
r olate set, after which the members of
the retiring central star presented
her a. handsome nut bowl and a
framed picture of the members of the
star in a group. Then there was the
presentation to the members of the
star by a committee of five, headed
by the retiring patron, of a beautiful
pin to each, the pin being symbolical
of the office she held. Under the di

riii SAN FRANCISCO CALLV SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20,-1903.
ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOMQuite the, newest' fad is that of hav-'
ing a valuable dog's horoscope cast
and nativity written out, according to
his birthday. A prominent society wo
man, who owns fine St. Bernards, in
telling r me her. reasons /or \ accepting
this new' fancy, said: . "It insures the
better development of their health and
general conditions. It enables one to
know their characteristics minutely, tp
better understand those who are
speechless and to help them . in their
unfavorable moments; also what
months the malefic planets affect them
and when/they are liable to die, in or
der to strive to avert the danger."
Let it be well understood that when a
society woman does not send her pet
to a bench show it is not because she
possesses none sufficiently valuable to
win medals, but simply because it is
not a very good thing for the dog. She
contends that a valuable animal can
contract pneumonia, and other diseases
generally upsetting his health compet
ing for a prize, when she is already
aware of his true worth and does not
care whether the public has the same
opinion or not.
Mrs. Francis J. Carolan enjoys the
distinction of owning the smallest dog
in the worldâ "Rosette"â whose favor
ite abiding place is her muff. Even
Mrs. Pat Campbell's dog does not com
pare with it. Mrs. William H. Crocker
arid her sister. Princess
have the only Pomeranians in this part
of the country. This breed of dog is
the prevailing fad in New York and
England, especially London. Mrs.
Crocker and the Princess paid a fabu
lous price for these canines at a Goth
am bench show in 1901.
Mrs. T. H. Williams is the proud pos
sessor of two Boston bull terriers whose
sister was sold for 53600. These dogs
were recently presented to the family
by W. A. Pinkerton of Chicago, who is
fond of good dogs, having twenty val-
ribbons at bench shows. -
With the approach of the Yuletide,
when all the world rejoices, the society
woman, in a plain little -tailor-made
prnwn. is seen flying along the busiest
streets and devoting every spare mo
ment to her Christmas shopping. She
is taking Father Time by the forelock
this year, for never before in the his
tory of San Francisco has the rush
begun so early. All are intent upon
buying their presents early to avoid a
late rush, and will in consequence buy
more than ever, as they are certain to
find some other things to get at the
elf-venth hour. The streets are thronged
â¢with hurrying people and the stores
are crowded with a bewildering array
of gifts, but in all the confusion miladl
will not forget to purchase something
for each one in whom she. Is interested.
She loosens the pursestrings with true
Western generosity and provides glad
surprises, not only for her own loved
ones, but looks out for the less fortu
nate children who otherwise would not
have much of a Christmas. Nor are
the pets at home left out of the festivi
ties. On Christmas morning scores of
faithful dogs will receive their presents
together with the other members of the
household. They. may not know what
It all means, and it is theirs not to
question why, but results count for
most with a canine. The sumptuous
Christmas dinner they Â¦ will receive
would be just as much appreciated any
other day in the year, and the dog is
pot at^all particuTar r 'about waiting an
t'lher year for the next.
'â¢ However, the fact that it is more
blessed to give than to receive assures
.the society woman of ample compensa-.
tion for her thoughtfulness. Devotion
is always good to see, and if
she has enough kindliness for all of her
family and friends and pet animals, as
well, then is miladi twice" blessed. '

LONDON. Dec. I9.-General Ben
jamin Viljoen. the former Boer com
mander, sailed for New York on the
steamship Umbria for. the purpose of
completing arrangements for the estab
lishment of a Boer colony In Mexico.
He savs that he has already secured
S5.000 acres and expects to get 2,000.000
more later on, in Northern. Mexico,
where the climate closely resembles
that of the Transvaal.
General Viljoen gives a discouraging
account of the situation of the Boera In
South Africa at the present time. He
says that It was the policy of the lead
ers after the war to encourage, the
burghers to remain In the country in
the hope of securing local self-govern
ment, but the conditions render it im
possible for them to remain longer. The
country has been devastated and cattle

The dogs' bootmakers in Paris are
making more rubbers than ever before
this year. Dressing a dog's feet for

a stitch in time, savins a bill at the
veterinary surgeon's later on.
This fad is being more cordially re
ceived by the owners of valuable dogs
than is the French woman's present
leaning toward fancy shoes for her
French poodle. This extravagance will
not appeal to the logical American
mind sufficiently to become frequent in
this country, although some Califor-,
nians who have lived In Paris have
been striving to introduce it here.'
There is a dog: not 1000 miles from
San Francisco that wears moccasins
when in the country to keep "ticks"

that doers are ashamed of being "rag

actually lines up and waits to have his
moccasins put on before going out of

At one time Paris only was listened

pernicious habit .of dyeing the hair.
They are alsp showing to society at

hair, especially with a sprinkling of
soft white powder upon it.
Consuelo, the Duchess of Marlbor

this natural colored-hair crusade, and
others are taking it up, with much se

down the coloring of their hair will
perhaps be over forever. Last season

"let their hair go," the expression used
in connection with this new order of
things, and the return to town this
winter will see tremendous Increase
in the number of gray heads.
The country season has been oppor
tunity for the first trial of the new
law, for the initial stages are by far the
most trying from the point of becom

beauty of an inch of gray hair next to

Mr. and Mrs. John C Mooney, who
were married on October 21 at the cath

there until their new home is : built.
Mrs. Mooney, who was Miss Nellie
Glynn, is an attractive bride and the
favorite niece of Judge Robert Tobin,
to whom she was most devoted during
his long illness, "in fact, she held her
recent post-nuptial receptions at the
Tobin home, 1380 'Geary street. She

Christmas week will be marked by a

the Bradley-Martin ball was to New

to warrant their keeping it. The Pal

and a delicious extravagance will per

No expense will be spared in floral dec

costly," like the wedding presents we
read about. There will be not less than
150 guests and not more than . 250, and
the sumptuous supper alone will repre

$2000. The guests will include the most

the tale abroad when ... otherwise tt
might have remained unknown. Ami
much hair that was never dyed had the
credit of being artificially touched up,
so general had the system become.
"Why do you bother?" said an Amer
ican society woman to a more timid
English sister. "Why not leave your
hair alone? I think gray hair is pretty.
I'm not 30, but I don't mind having it.
It isn't your hair that makes you look
old; it's your face, /nd if you're be
ginning to get old. doesn't gray hair
just soften down all the wrinkles? I
think women are going to look prettier
all round whan they've let their hair
go and It will certainly keep them from
looking old by saving them all tho
bother of perpetually seeing to their
hair and worrying when they know it
wants doing again, whether any on
else has noticed. I know. I tried it
for two years. That was quite enough
for me.
"It's all very well when you've only
to ring your bell and the coiffeur ar
rives with. everything to do it properly,
but wait till you're miles away from
civilization with a choice party, of im
portant people and you want to look
your best; or. worse still, when you are
on a yacht without any sort of help
and you have to sit up half the night
doctoring your hair. And to think that
you would have to go on with this for
the rest of your life! It's much better,
when you see that you are going gray,
to grip hold of the fact. If you don't
like the 'in-between-time,' when you
are neither one thing nor the other,
just put on a little white powder,
which doesn't hurt the hair, and
which you can brush off at any mo
ment."
The dusting of hair with powder,
which the Anglo-Americans whose hair
is going gray have made so fashiona
ble, is the saving grace of the difficulty,
for dyed hair left to itself is far from
pleasing. The coloring fades off tho
long hair, but not evenly, leaving one
part quite dark in tone when the other
is light, but all presenting a dingy ap
pearance and in marked contrast to
the gray hair rapidly increasing In
length from the roots. The harsh and
stringy appearance of the first gray
hair when left to itself is quite lost
when the coiffure is daintily powdered.

RENO MARRIAGESâ A Subscriber.
City. In The Call of August 6, 1902,
page 7, column 2, you will find the de
cision of the Supreme Court of this
State relative to Reno marriages. This
department has not the space to repro
duce the decision of the court. The gist
of that decision Is that marriages con
tracted in the State of Nevada, or any
other State, after divorces In this State
are valid.
THE CALL is in receipt of the following letter from
Merced: "Your article in to-day's Call on 'Life in
the Open' is indeed timely and very interesting.
Would you not be so good as to inform The Call readers
which palms are especially desirable for street trees in
Central California, say Merced and Fresno counties?"
. The palm flourishes in all Central and Northern Cali
fornia, where many varieties may.be used in garniture
of streets and lawns. The best sorts for street use are
the Washington fan palm, which is a native of this State,
and the canary palm. v If kept properly trimmed their
fronds do not obstruct the use' of the sidewalk and they
soon rise in beautiful columns and their branches and
leaves are far above the walk. The canary is a date
palm of especially beautiful and fernlike foliage, while
the Washington fan palm has a noble column and very
attractive foliage. ,
In planting street trees the same tree should be used
on the whole street and should be planted not more than
fifty feet apart. In this way* a symmetrical and splendid
effect is secured. All Central and California
rJiould use the date and Washington fan palm freely on
PALMS FOR STREETS.
HOLLYâ A. S.. City. There is an old
superstition that it is sinful to sing
against holly, which Is expressed In tha
following lines:
Whosoever against holly do cry
In a rope shall be hung full high.
Whosoever against holly Â«lo sins.
He may weep and his hands wrln*.
Allelujah!
A law designed to protect that part of the public
rightly catalogued as fools from the schemes pf the
get-rich-quick turf agencies has been introduced in Con
gress and seems likely to be adopted. It sometimes
appears that the vast sums of money thus spent in legis
lation and enforcement might be expended to better
advantage in the building and maintenance of homes for
the feeble-minded.
1 The Moros have no system of laws
as such. The penal passages of the
Koran, taken in connection with the
local customs, are referred to as the
Titab. To be precise, the local cus
toms are mainly interpretations or eva
sions of the Titab proper.
Land is held in common, the dattos
claiming sections as their own, just as
our Indian chiefs were wont to do. In
some localities a "Master of the Field"
allots -.slats'' of ground to individuals
for permanent or temporary occupancy.
Such real estate may not be' alienated
without permission having first been
obtained from the authority granting
residence thereon. The criminal laws,
if such they may be called, are pecu
liar. The Koran provides as a penalty
for theft that the hands of the thief
should be cut off. In consequence of
this appalling penalty the conviction
of a thief is next to impossible. Moros
evade this penalty by shifting the re
sponsibility from the thief to the man
who has suffered loss. It Is held that
the victim of theft is criminally cul
pable In that he has neglected to safe
guard his property. It is even more
difficult * to convict a murderer. The
accused swears that he did not com
mit the crime, his relatives are sworn

In the ambitious plans which our military authorities
have discussed, revised and planned again for the inva
sion of the United States of Colombia two very impor
tant elements of success, by some strange oversight,
have been overlooked. The climate of' the South

absolutely nothing has been done, as far as the public
knows, to secure the consent of Colombia.
A Chicago contractor, angry of mood and intemper
ate of speech, declared the other day that the American

to believe that the American flag is the emblem of any
thing else.' He should be convinced that he is acting

"Some of the little ones I meet dur

said a well-known clergyman a few
nights ago, "are remarkably bright. I
met one a short time ago who was very
pert, to say the least.
"I visited the school just at recess
time. As I entered the yard where the
children were at play I heard this
youngster, a girl about 8 years old, call
a playmate a fool. Thinking to scare
her a little bit and thus break her of
the habit of using the word, I called
her to me and said:
. " 'Julia, don't you know that when
you call a person a fool you are within
an inch of hell?*
"Quick as a flash the little one turned
around and again called her playmate
a fool.
" 'Child,' I said, surprised and shocked,
'what made you do that?'
" * 'Cos I wanted to be two inches, fa
ther,' was the answer I got."

THE CALL comes to its readers this morning with
forewords of cheer and good counsel for Christ
mas day. It is bright with pictures and sparkles
with good stories by some of the foremost writers of the
day. It has its special attractions for persons of all ages
and of all tastes, and these will doubtless hold for a
long time the attention of every reader. We ask. spe
cial study, however, for the advertising columns, which
at this time being so pertinent to the shopping season,
are doubly entertaining and instructive.
The abundance and variety of the goods displayed in
our advertisements affords a striking proof of the pros
perity and general wealth of the community. It is evi
dent that Santa Clau.s is to have a busy time in the dis
tribution of the many gifts with which he wilPbe charged
on Christmas eve. Between now and that time there
remain just four days for shopping and it will there
fore repay every person who has the Christmas spirit in
his heart to read carefully the list of the many beautiful
and desirable presents offered to the public. Such study
will result in showing the reader just where to find the
exact thing in the way of a gift he has been trying to
think of ever since he began considering, how to make
up his Christmas souvenirs, and it will also show him
just where to obtain it in the highest perfection at the
lowest price.
.One further word of counsel should be noted. In the
few days that remain before Christmas there will be an
enormous shopping trade to be done. This therefore is
a time to remember the maxim, "Come early and avoid
the rush." From this time on each successive day will
find the stores more' crowded than the day preceding.
All who can find the fime therefore should get their
shopping done to-morrow, so as to save themselves the
discomfort of the final thronging of the stores just before
the great day comes. Furthermore all who can do their
slropping by day shottld^do so, leaving the evening hours
for those who are so busy during the day that they can
not attend to' their Christmas purchasing until after ordi
nary working hours are' over.
It is to be the high water mark of Christmas in San
Francisco and by the exercise of a little energy in prompt
shopping the season can be made wholly pleasant for all.
Tothat end we renew the advice that a careful study be
given to the advertising columns to-day. That is the
best way of preparing for the rush of the coming week.
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.
Authorized representatives of the Boers have declared
that at St. Louis an exhibition descriptive and typical
of the Boer people will be made. Such a display should
be one of the most Valuable and interesting of them all

and ideals which, unfortunately, are fast ' disappearing

"An English friend who keeps ma
posted concerning things bibliograph
ical," says a New York book collector,
"recently advised me that the long lost
copy of Governor Hunter's 'Andro
borus,' New York, 1714. was in the pos-Â«
session of a Scottish book dealer, who
wanted 25 guineas for it.
"The book was cheap at five times
the price, for 'Androborus' Is the
earliest American play and one of the
rarest of the imprints of William Brad
ford, New York's first printer, only two
examples being known to bibliographers
âJohn Philip Kemble'3 copy, now in
the Duke of Devonshire's library, and
the one just referred to, which was
sold at auction in Edinburgh in 1S60
and immediately disappeared from
view. I cabled at once to the Scottish
dealer, but received the disappointing
reply that the book had been sold to a
private customer, presumably an Eng
lish collector. However, I still do not
despair of yet acquiring the first dra
matic piece written and printed in this
country.
"The full title of this whimsical pro
duction, which was intended as a per
sonal satire on Hunter's political an
tagonists, is as follows: 'Androborus, a
Biographical Farce, in Three Acts, viz.:
the Senate, the Consistory and the
Apotheosis. Printed at Monoropolis
since the 1st of August, 1714/ In its
preparation the Governor was assisted
by Chief Justice Lewis Morris, Cadwal
lader Colden noting in hi3 'Letters on
Smith's History of New York' (New-
York Historical Society collections)
that 'Hunter diverted himself in com
posing a farce, with the assistance of
Mr. Morris, which he called "Andro
borus." "

"Halt!" Sharp and clear in the morri
ing air rang out the officer's voice. As
he cried he started s on a dead run in
the direction taken by a man who
dashed full-speed from a house on
Howard street, near East. Dim in the
distance' was the flying figure, but.
nothing daunted, the policeman started
in pursuit. Fleet of foot was the po
liceman and he gained rapidly 00 the
man ahead. Again he cried "Halt,"
but the pursued only answered with a
burst of speed, that widened the space
between him and the bluecoat.
"Halt," again crie\l the officer, striv
ing as best he could without losing
speed to get out his revolver. But
the man only ran faster. It was a
pretty race, a losing one seemingly for
the officer. He was about to speed a
bullet after the man in front when he
realized that he was gaining. Straining
every nerve he ran on. Foot by foot
he lessened the lead of the pursued one.
Inch by inch it grew smaller, and then
with a final effort the officer leaped into
the air and with outstretched arms
landed upon the shoulders of his game.
"You win," gasped the captive. "I
bet the fellows In the Howard street
house that I could .beat you to the
ferry."
T A Chase in the Night.
The country along this route is very
beautiful, and we enjoyed the scenery
even in spite cf untoward clrcum-
The second day we were very tired.
b*Jt we mai-ched some twenty miles,
and felt after supper as though we
m.ght reach Stanley Pool after all. We
learned from the natives how to fix our
loads so as to carry them with greater
case. Never make a load into a square
or spherical tundle, but make it as long
and as cylindrical as possible. Wo bÂ«
gran to learn many things front- the
carriers that were to our advantage.
We took the old caravan route over
the hills to Manyanga.
All along the way we met numerous
native traders, returning from the in
terior, some of them having come
from as far back as the Upper Pool.
They bring their ivory to Matadi, and
take back cloth, salt, gunpowder and
various other things, making an im
mense profit. The first day on the
road it was very hot, the sun beating
down mercilessly on the barren rocks
and sand, making them hot enough
to cook eggs, and the road over the
eteep hills was rough and hard. We
were almost inclined to turn back,
and began to fear we had undertaken
an impossible task. But we thought
of the many Americans that had car
ried greater loads and had endured
greater hardships;, we thought also of
the stream of people who would pass
over this same route with pack and
pickax, if gyld were discovered in the
lnterior, v and Vc plucked up. courage
nnd persevered until almost sundown.
We made about seven miles the first
day, and that left about 230 miles still
to go.
We were quite curiosities to the na
tives. They would stand and stare at
us, almost disbelieving their eyes.
Then they would call their friends, to
see if they were right. Yes, there
were two white carriers. They didn't
understand it. Then the white men
must be slaves, too. And they asked
us who our masters were, and told us
we were the first white slaves they
had seen carrying loads. It was very
amusing the way they treated us. And
no amount of explanation could i\ake
them understand that we were : our
own masters. They always asked:
"Why do you carry loads, then?"
We spent six weeks at Matadi trying
to get our guns out of the custom
house. We had too much of an arse
nal, the officials thought, informing us
we must have a x>ermit from the Gov
ernment to carry arms. This was re
fused point blank, and matters were
looking bad. when I got a letter from
the Upper Congo telling me to come
to Stanley Pool. We put our goods in
a warehouse and tried for the last time
to get a few guns, but without avail,
and were forced to go without them.
Our supplies were running low and
our funds were exhausted. To go by
rail was impossible, as we had no
credit with the Belgian Railroad Com
pany for the 474 francs necessary for
each fare, and we resolved to make
474 francs apiece by walking. Any
man who considers himself an author
ity on African travel would tell you
It is impossible to make the trip from
Matadi to Stanley Poo! during the
rainy season without tents, beds and
other conveniences, and to carry a
load simply absurd at any season. We
were, perhaps, the first white men
that attempted it: We gave our men
forty cans of , provisions to carry. Mr.
McClintock carried twenty pounds of
sea biscuit, an eight-pound blanket
and his absolutely necessary clothing,
which made forty pounds in all. I
had the medicine, writing material,
one or two necessary instruments, my
clothing, blanket and so forth â
enough to make forty pounds.
BT WILLIAM STAMPS CHEBBT.
(African Traveler. Kxi>lorer and Ulg Game
Hunter.)
<CopyriKht. 1903. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
While McClintock and I were at
Matadi I discovered one night by an
intolerable itching of one of my toes
that a "jigger" â that dreaded pest of
all African travelersâ had taken lodg
ings with me. McClintock took a knife
and presently gave me relief by the
painful process of digging the little
black parasite from beneath the skin
surrounding the nail.
The presence of the jigger is indi
cated by the itchy feeling which
makes some "people so frantic that
they could almost tear off their toes
to get relief. The Jigger looks like a
small bit of parailin wax the size of
a pin head, with a bleck speck in it.
They burrow beneath the skin, and
in the course cf eight or ten days lay
a sack of eggs as large as a pea. This
sack breaks and hundreds of young
jiggers are turned out to burrow for
themselves, and in time infect the en
tire foot. Many of the natives are in
debted to these* liny insects for the
loss of a toe and some for that of a

PARIS is a long way off to be the scene of a decla
ration of war by Colombia against Panama, the
United States and all^ comers. Yet from Paris
comes the news that a committee formed of all..Colom
bians in Europe is organized to instruct foreign Govern
ments in the Panama matter, and that unless the. seces
sion of Panama is submitted to the Hague court war in
its most horrid form will make the isthmus howl. Colom
bia will then appeal to the other Central American
states to stand in, and trouble, lurid and frowning of
aspect, will begin. ' (
In the first place it is doubtful if the question of the
right of revolution is among the issues with which the
Hague court can deal. It is probable that such matters
as a division of the public debt of Colombia, a proper
share to be assumed by Panama, might go to arbitra
tion. But the right of revolution is another thing en
tirely. Iii international law revolution is regarded as an
inherent right, which when asserted carries with it all
the responsibility of success or failure.
Nor is it probable at all that the court can be used to
construe the treaty of 1846. Parties to treaties only
are concerned in them and put- upon them their own
construction. No one has ever denied the construction
of the sovereignty clause of that treaty declared by
Lewis Cass and Mr. Seward. It is only protective of the
sovereignty of the isthmus against European interfer
ence. This is in direct line with the Monroe, doctrine.
It is fantastic to say that we undertook to make Colom
bian sovereignty secure against domestic revolution, for
that would make the treaty one of offensive and de
fensive alliance.
The treaty was again practically construed by Mr.
Cleveland when he withdrew from the Senate the Fre
linghuysen treaty with Nicaragua and Costa Rica be
cause it was one of alliance, defensive and offensive.
We had made no treaties of. that kind with any country
since the treaty 1 of 1778 with France, which we were
compelled in our own interest and from motives of self
preservation to abrogate. The Monroe doctrine is not
a treaty. It is a declaration of national policy, upon
which we may act or omit to act as suits our own situa
tion.
We have recognized the de facto Government of Pan
ama, as have most of* the European powers. Mexico
has followed suit and so has Nicaragua, and probably
other Central American states will do the same. We
have entered into a treaty with Panama, as was our
right and hers. It secures for us advantages of tran
scendent importance to the United States and the world
in the construction of the canal. Senators Hoar and
Daniel are taking up the time of the Senate in discussing
resolutions of inquiry into the incidents of the revolu
tion. To this there is no objection, except so far as
their J speeches impeach the administration because of
things alleged and not known. When the Senate passes
its resolution of inquiry it will be answered by all the
facts known to the administration. Indeed these have
already been communicated in the President's message.
There is upon the Senate quite another duty which it
must perform or be itself impeached for blocking., an
isthmian canal. This is the duty of ratifying the Â¦ Panama
treaty. When this is done we will have -absolute sov
ereignty over a canal strip twenty miles wide. When
we have that secured Colombia may make all the war
she wants, but she must keep off our strip or take the
consequences. It is easy to see that after Panama has
a constitution and a government de jure, both of which
events will occur in a few weeks, she may, if she choose,
reincorporate her territory with Colombia, for such act
would in no way impair the rights ceded to us when she
had the independent power of cession. This is the sit
uation that has been created by the prompt action of the
President. The American people see it clearly and all
who understand the nature of the so-called republics of
Central America know that in no other way could we get
the canal rights that we require if the work is ever to be
done.
We are of the opinion that the minority cannot make
politics out of the situation. If there is an earnest desire
to have the canal, and we believe such desire to be gen
eral, it is incumbent upon the minority in Congress to
demonstrate that as favorable terms as we have under
the Panama treaty can- be secured from Colombia or
from Nicaragua or Costa Rica. We believe that this
cannot be done. Colombia rejected the Hay-Herran
treaty on the ground that it impaired her sovereignty.
The other two states have already demanded that we
pay not only money for a canal across them, but that
our right to protect the canal be recompensed to them
by an offensive and defensive alliance. â¢
Will the minority favor such an alliance? It would
compel us to follow the belligerent vagaries of two un
stable Governments' If the Panama treaty is ratified
we will not have to follow anybody, but will be in a per
fectly independent position. It seems as though no rea
sonable argument is possible in opposition to the prompt
ratification of the treaty. Hesitancy and the waste of
time in attacks upon the President will be in the interest
of Colombia and against the canal.
Th* women are always In greater
number than the men. They are better
traders In small matters. The remarks
of surprise over a price they think a
little too high, the audacity with which
they will jew down the price, the in
dignation they show as if they were
hurt or angry, the coaxing, the appeal
to generosity or vanity or to weak
ptrints in the buyer are often extreme
ly ludicrous. The sale of food is al
ways left exchisively to women. The
articles offered are numberless â goats,
pigs, chickens, fish (rresh and dried),
the flesh of the hippopotamus smoked
and cooked, dogs, grasshoppers, locusts,
sweet potatoes, corn, beans, bananas,
peanuts, pawpaws, eggs, manioc (raw
and boiled), chaquanga, pineapples,
sugar cane, lemons, palm nuts, tobacco,
greens, red peppers, ivory, native rope,
European cloth of all kinds, gunpowder,
glasses, pots, beads â In short, every
thing known to African commerce on
the coast.
There is a rigorous and effective po
lice system. The punishment for theft
is swift and severe. If the 'offense is
an aggravated one the thief may be
killed on the spot. The markets com
mence about 10 o'clock and close about
3 in the afternoon.
Food supplies in Africa are generally
sold at markets. When a market has
been broken up by war or other cause,
the natives say "the market is dead."
Markets are always held outside the
villages and generally on the tops of
hills where there is not much shade.
Everybody goes, the mother carrying
her. infant on her ba'ck and a great load
of chaquanga-on her head, the infant
hanging on like a little monkey. Un

undergone a constant clipping until
during the last ten years they have
come dcr.vn from the first standard of
twenty-four inches to about four.
Money now is slowly taking their place.
The villages near the coast are few
and far between, and the natives some
times have to carry their produce fifty
or seventy-five miles to market. The
markets seem to be very ancient insti
tutions. They are held frequently and
are called after the- village nearest.
They are usually held every four days,
sometimes every eight.

The carriers are an interesting lot.
Some of them are small boys, not o\ r er
5 years old. I am sure I am not under
estimating their age. At that tender
age they are compelled to carry a load
almost equal to their own weight, and
to keep up with the caravan. We came
across several caravans, in which were
boys of 7. S. 9 and 10 years of age. I
would Judge that the majority were be
tween the ages of 9 and 16. Now that
the native traders are carrying for
themselves r.nd the State imposes upon
them a fixed tax for every load, they
carrj- as heavy burdens as it is possi
ble for them to stagger under. It is as
if a civilized person had the oppor
tunity of taking away as much gold as
he could carry. Three bags of salt,
fifty pounds each, rations and a can
or two of gunpowder constitute a not
uncommon load.
The natives are slightly built as a
rule, and will not average in weight
more than HO pounds. Their rations
do not amount to much when they are
on the road. They generally consist cf
a small piece of guanga that will not
weigh eight ounces, and possibly an
ounce of dried fish served two or three
times a day. They pick up what palm
nuts they tan gather by the way, but
these will not amount to more than
four or five ounces a day per man.
Their main standby is the kola nut,
which has wonderful sustaining power.
The natives are as patient as Job un
der their big loads. I doubt whether I
could carry one of them a mile. They
trudge on all day long, tottering under
their heavy burdens, which have to be
lifted UDon their shoulders or hoisted
up by the ingenious device of using
their staff as a lever.
When we arrived at Manyanga we
rested two days and got four other re
cruits, so that for our slender stock of
goods we had carriers to spare. Our
carriers w?re nothing but boys and
they carried small loads. We had a
heavy downpour of rain and conse
quently bad roads, and one afternoon
marched for two hours in water from
knee-high to places where it was up to
our necks.
stances. We had splendid appetites.
Sometimes we had to eat in the broil
ing sun; sometimes we. were fortuuate
enough to get under the shade of a
huge tree with luxuriant foliage and
lie dawn upon a carpet of green orna
mented with fragrant flowers. It was
the spring of the year and 'everything
was as fresh and beautiful as could be
imagined. Birds of brilliant hue were
singing in the' branches of the trees,
and gayly painted butterflies were
darting to and fro. Every step brought
new surprises of delight.
On the fourth day out our troubles
commenced. After marching hard all
day we laid down to rest. Up to this
time we had not encountered many
mosquitoes, but this night we had a
visit from forae of the most blood
thirsty specimens of the tribe that I
have ever had the misfortune to meet.
The swamos of the Missouri and Mis
sissippi River bottoms are not to be
compared in this respect with this part
of the Con^o basin; nor is any other
place in Africa that I know of. These
mosquitoes are as intelligent as they
are vicious. They would crawl under
the blankets. It was no use trying to
elude them.
About 12 o'clock it commenced to
rain, and everything got soaked and
sodden. To sleep was an impossibility.
Next day -.ve marched through a tor
rent of rain, and from this on to Man
yanga we had a bad time. It was only
four days longer, but these four days
seemed like a month. The streams were
swollen by the rains and the swamps
inundated, but we pushed on, wading
and swimming when necessary. I had
the misfortune to poison one of my
feet, and it was almost a solid blister,
but we kept jogging along, and got to
Manyanga at last.
the streets of cities for economic as well as esthetic rea
sons. The date palm ripens its edible fruit farther north
in this State than elsewhere in the world. Mr. Swingle,
the date expert of the Agricultural Department at Wash
ington, says that all edibleWarieties of the except
the deglet noor will perfect their fruit throughout the
Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, as they do now at
Winters, in Yolo County, and also in Butte County.
The adaptation of bur climate to the date palm is
shown by the fact that when date seeds are thrown on
the ground they sprout and produce a tree. The date
palm orchard on the Wolfskill ranch at Winters, in
Yolo County, grew from date seeds planted there by Mr.
Wolfskill. Now it is easy to see that the use of palms
as a street tree continually impresses the Eastern visitor
with the clemency of our climate and its adaptation to
tropical flora. When the Washington palm is used the
fact that it is a native of California puts our climate in
the Oriental class at once. If either the Washington or
canary palm is planted when about two feet high and re
ceives proper irrigation and attention from the first it
beautifies the street and its growth is so rapid when it is
cared for that in a few years it ennobles and gives a
charm to the place that no deciduous tree can impart.
We have not been properly attentive to these matters
in Central and Northern California. We have impressive
capital in our climate alone. A -climate that enables a
city to line its streets with palms away north to where
from under the fronds of .this tropical tree the opales
cent snows that form the helmet of Shasta may be seen
is of a value greater than all the gold of the continent.
Man could not create its equal by any investment of capi
tal or expenditure of labor. Then why not make use of
this sumptuous investment which prodigal nature has
made for our benefit?
The use of. it lies in taking advantage of it, not only
in grapes, oranges, olives, figs, pomegranates and our
vast variety of other commercial fruits, but in garnishing
our streets and landscapes with palms, identified in
sacred and profane history with the romance and life, the
sunshine and the poetry of the Orient. A city that so
uses the advantage of climate adds greatly to the value
of its property as well as to the pleasure of its people.
Several guests at a downtown hotel
were discussing things supernatural,
and there was almost universal denial
of the existence of "spooks," death
warnings and other uncanny matters.
One of the group said:
"I don't know about that sort of
thing. I will tell you what happened
in my own experience and you can
judge for yourselves whether there is
anything in it or not.
"I was for some years purser on an
Atlantic liner, and one of my boyhood
friends, Jim Grant, was purser on an
other steamer of the same line. I heard
before I started on that particular trip
that Jim had to lay off through a. bad
cold, bul nothing serious was antici
pated. Well, on the return trip, when
we were about four days from port. I
was asleep in "my bunk and was awak
ened by something like a cold, clammy
hand pressing* my forehead. I opened
my eyes and, as I thought, saw Grant
standing in a sort of grayish light. I
heard him distinctly say, 'Good-by, old
man, you'll never see me again f * and he
seemed to fade from my startled sight.
"I jumped out of my bunk, struck a
light and instinctively looked at my
watch. I went on deck and asked the
man at the wheel and the officer on
watch if they had noticed anything pe
culiar, but they replied in the negative.
I had a foreboding that something se
rious was wrong with my friend Grant,
and when. we reached port I wired to
his father and received a reply that he
was dead and had been buried the day
before. I subsequently learned that he
died at the very "minute his apparition,
or whatever it was, appeared to me."

BERLIN, Dec. 19. â Berlin society is
greatly excited over the divorce of
Countess Isabella Bronsart von Schel
lendorf, nee Adams, an American, who
will arrive on the Hamburg-American
line steamer Bluecher next week. Noth
ing concerning the affair appeared in
the German papers until to-day, when
the Tageblatt stated the facts in the
case. It appears the Countess married
Lieutenant von Bronsart Schellendorf ,
a nobleman and a nephew of a former
Minister of War, in East* Africa, whers
he commanded one of Germany's sta
tions. Previous rumors regarding the
marital affairs of. the couple have been
in circulation, but the Countess has
said, according to the Tageblatt, that
the marriage was dissolved upon her
motion on the ground of her husband's
Infidelity and that the court at Tanga,
in German East Africa, decided that
he "alone ..was' guilty. A pamv-hlet re
citing the history of the case has been
privately circulated among the friends
and relatives of the Countess, cf which
she is presumably the author.

Llgon, well dressed and in the posses

States prisoner in the County Jail,
charged with being implicated in one
of the most gigantic schemes to de
fraud through the mails that has ever
been worked In the Southern States. A
United States officer is now en route
from Memphis, Tenn., to take him back
for trial.
The postal authorities had noticed
that a vast quantity of mail was being
sent to addresses throughout the South
and West by one Robert H. Banks of
Memphis and that he was receiving
thousands .of letters - daily, many of
them containing money orders. Banks
represented in his circulars that he
was receiver for the Mississippi Valley
Planters' Publishing. Company, and
that a "court of claims" at the instance
of the "Chicago Paper Company" had
ordered the distribution to subscribers
of all premiums which had been adver
tised. The list of premiums had been
partly destroyed, and Banks was or
dered to make out a new list. The pre
miums ranged from a mule r to a piano,
and all that was asked of those receiv
ing the circulars was that they remit
express charges and receive their pre
miums free. Of course, there were no
â¢such concerns as the "publishing com
pany," the "court of claims" or the
"Chicago Paper Company." and no sub^
scription list, but the victims fell over
each other in biting at the bait and
sent express charges, the amounts of
which depended upon the weight of the
article selected and the distance. The
swindle netted -the operators many
thousands of dollars.

all the hay from Pavkovlch's barn and
beneath it found a trapdoor. This was
pried up and disclosed a stairway,
down which the officers passed/About'
fifteen or twenty feet befow they found
themselves in a large underground
room filled with casks of goodly size.
One at a time these were tapped, sam- j
pies being drawn off into bottles. In
each instance the casks were found to
contain brandy of a very fine brand.
The discovery fairly stunned the of
ficers for a time, the -contents of the
secret chamber representing from 9000
to 10,000 gallons of liquor, and proved
beyond a doubt to their minds the guilt
of the rich old Frenchman, who for
these many years evidently has be^n !
increasing his wealth at the cost of the
Government.
A number of deputies have* been left
In charge of the winery at Declezville.
until an order from the United States
court is received under which .the
brandy will be emptied out unto the
earth. r
This gives the Bay Cities Company
an Immense water supply, and at the
same time it has made a coup on the
Spring Valley Company. The water
supply of the Mount Hamilton water
shed is to be diverted into the big plant
of the Bay Cities Water Company,
near Coyote Station, ten miles south
of this city. An immense reservoir is
planned for Coyote Station, and already
the company has sunk some immense
wells there and erected a ' pumping
plant. The Bay Cities Company is^now
building a tunnel in the hills near
Smith Creek, which will be 3000 feet
long, . and through which the waters
Just secured will be carried to the big
reservoir near Coyote. , The purchase
from Qullty also secures a fine reser- ,
voir site with a capacity of 2,000,000,000
gallons.
The Spring Valley Water Company '
has a reservoir site in Calaveras Val
ley, on which it has done some work,
and it was the natural outlet for the
waters of the Mount Hamilton water- j
shed. By the transfer to-day the Bay I
Cities Company has got ahead of the
Spring Valley Company and secured a
water supply which is large enough to
make it a dangerous competitor of the
other company.
No price is mentioned in the transfer,
but It is said that the price is up in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
It is rumored that inside of a year
the Bay Cities Company will become
an active competitor of the San Jose
Water Company and the Spring Valley
Water Company. There is a legal fight
now pending between the three water
companies for the reservoir site at
Coyote, in which the San Jose and
Spring Valley companies are trying
to block the Bay Cities Company.
Citizens of the county are also pre
paring to enjoin the Bay Cities Com
pany from taking the water from the
gravel beds at Coyote, by wells, on the
ground .that the percolating waters of
the county will be interfered with, and
that the water supply of the farmers j
and the orchardists will suffer. The Bay j
Cities Company had proposed to take !
some 100,000,000 gallons a day from
this county to 3ell to Oakland and San
Francisco.
With the supply of water secured |
from the Mount Hamilton water-shed \
tÂ£e Bay Cities Company will be able ,
to go right ahead /and carry out its
plans while the threatened litigation is j
pending, as the water brought from i
Smith Creek, -Santa Ysabel, Arroyo
Honda and Arroya Bonita creeks will !
be sufficient^ J
SAN JOSE, Dec. 19. â An important
transaction in relation to the water
supply of Santa Clara County went on
record yesterday, when C. W. Qullty
and wife and the' San Jose Lighting
Company transferred Ahe Mount Ham
ilton watershed to Frank G. Drum of
San Francisco. Drum is a representa
tive of Messrs. Haggin and T*evis, and
there is little doubt that the purchase
of the watershed is made for the Bay
Cities Water Company, in which Hag
ign and Tevis have large j interests.
From eighty to one hundred square
miles of watershed is secured, and it
has a storage capacity of 2,000,000,000
gallons.
The transfers recorded yesterday con
sist of five deeds. Three of these are.
from Quilty and his wife and the other
two are from "the San Jose Lighting
Company. These deeds cover sixty
eight deeds, giants, options and agree
ments, secured by Qullty since 1895,
and cover nearly every drop of water
of the Mount Hamilton water-shed.
The transaction shows that all lands,
water rights, rights of way, easements
and reservations along Smith Creek,
Arroyo Honda, Santa Ysabel and Ar
roya Bonita are sold to Drum. v

The excellence and high standing of
this institution and the great benefits
derived from it by investors are thor
oughly demonstrated by its steady and
phenomenal growth since its founding.
This year's growth of the Continental
has broken the record. The subscribed
capital has - increased by over two
and one-half million dollars during the
year and the total subscribed capital is
now $15,6S3,700.
The paid-in capital has increased by
hajf a million dollars and now amounts,
in round numbers, to $3,000,000.
" During the year 743 loans have been
made, amounting to $990,400. Of this
number 362 were building loans.'
The personnel of the directorate of the
Continental is of the highest. This is
the list of officers and . directors:
Dr. Washington Dodge (City and
County -Assessor), president; James
McCullough (manager of Armour
Packing Company), vice president;
William Corbin, secretary and gen
eral manager; Gavin McXab, attor
ney, and Dr. Joseph G. Crawford (United
States Kxaminer. for Pensions). These
names stand for a great deal. They mean
integrity and intelligent and progressive
business methods.
The Continental believes that " the
doorstep of one's own home is a long
step toward success. It also believes
that it is better to buy a home than to
borrow one. The report of Secretary and
Manager Corbin shows a total of 362
new homes "built for members during the
year. During the previous year 184 were
erected.
The Continental has now 15,000 mem
bers who are not home builders, but are
using the association for the purpose of
saving such money as they may be able
from time to time to deposit and thus ac
cumulate. On all such money they are
being paid a liberal rate of interest.
.The six per cent certificates of deposit
issued by this association are among the
best investments in the State. The in
terest is payable semi-annually on the
first d~ay of January and the first day of
July of each year.
The comparative statement, showing
the increase in subscribed capital- of the
Continental each year, from June 30.
3 894. to June 30, 1903. is interesting as
showing the marvelous growth of the
business of this progressive home-build
ing concern. This statement is as fol
lows:
| This not, only gives the Continental a
j proud position In the public estimation,
but it speaks well for the growth of the
city of San Francisco and. the State of
California, including the many thriving
Interior cities, whose people have availed
themselves in a large degree of the ben
efits offered by this concern. â¢ ,

Memories of pioneers run back to the
early days when there were but few bus
ncsa houses in' San Francisco â and
among the fow that were .stable from
the outset may be mentioned the "popu
lar house of Murphy. Grant & Co. the
growth of which has been unbroken since
the old days of San Francisco.
During, the prosperous half-century of
its existence the firm's business has been
extended to wide areas of the West and
the Orient. Wherever the fame of the
house has spread Its sales . have in
creased. Its Paciflc'Coast sales are very
large and stamp it as one of "the most
important business houses .in the Far
Wr.st.
Several times the house has had to en
large its imposing building at the north
cast corner of Sansome and Bush streets,
now one of the : most Â¦ spacious and
best equipped business houses in the
city. The members of the firm are con
servative men of integrity, holding high
places in the business and social life of

The judgment of the court, as out
lined by Judge Beatty, to be elaborated
and signed later, gives the defendants
the alternative of submitting to the
inspection, as directed in the original
order of the court, at the date to be set
by the complainant, or of Heinze, Tre
rise and Frank paying fines of $2000,
$500 and $500 respectively, ih addition
to being given into the custody of the
United States Marshal and being con
fined in the County Jail at Helena until
the order Is complied with.
Compliance with the orcer of Novem

satisfies the Judgment, which is stayed

inspection to take place.
HELENA, Mont.. Dec. 19.â F. Au
gustus Heinze, J. H. Trerise, the Mon
tana Ore Purchasing Company, Albert
Frank and the Johnstown Mining Com
pany have been found guilty of con
tempt of the United States Court by
Judge Knowles' court. The contempt
was in disregarding an order of inspec
tion and survey, granted on November
3, directing that the Butte and Boston
Company be allowed to inspect the
workings of the Michael Davitt and
remove from a crosscut a quantity of
debris and water with which it had
been filled. The order was directed to
the parties adjudged guilty of con
tempt.
HELENA, Mont., Dec. 19.â At the
trial of Isaac Gravelle. charged with
sending blackmailing letters to the
Northern Pacific and with dynamiting
trains, it developed to-day that the de
fendant had written threatening letters
to a witness, Bert Caty, inclosing an
other of the same character, which
Caty was to mail to the foreman of
the jury. Gravelle undertook to smug
gle the letter out of the Lewis and
Clark County jail about two weeks ago.
. Caty is a witness for the State. In
a letter addressed to him he was
warned that unless he went on the
stand and testified that the Northern
Pacific detectives had bribed him to
testify' against the defendant his house
would be blown up. Inclosed was a
letter printed with pen and ink which
Caty was directed to mail to the fore
man of the Jury. In this letter the
jurors were told that the defendant was
an innocent man and unless they ac
quitted him their houses would be
Mown up with dynamite. It ended, "Be
ware of us, we are the dynamiters." 1
Much of the testimony was of expert
character, tending to show that the
handwriting of Gravelle was precisely
the same as that of the writer of the
blackmailing letters alleged by the
State to have been written by the de
fendant. The letter addressed to the
Great Northern and mailed at Cascade
October 8 demanding $15,000 was also
shown to be in the handwriting of Gra
velle. ;{*%'*'
To-day the Pacific Coast Company,
which controls the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company, leased from private par
ties a tract of ten acres of land at the
corner of Tenth and Alameda streets,
this city, to be used as a retail lumber
yard. Possession of the property is
given January 1. The lease is for ten
years and the location is considered
especiallly good for the purposes for
which it is to be used. It is in close
proximity to nearly all the large plan

Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe rail
roads.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. .19.â The war
between the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company and the local lumber compa
nies is approaching a crisis. General
Manager W. E. Pearce of the steam
ship company arrived in the city yes
terday and is in consultation with local
officers of the company on the situa
tion. Commenting on the present status
of the fight Mr. Pearce said:
"We have had no intimation from the
lumber companies that they want to
compromise the fiGht. There is only
one compromise we will entertain, and
that is the abandonment by the lumber
companies o: the passenger | business
they are doing with their steam schoon
ers.
"A corner in lumber is impossible. No
man or set of men can corner the lum
ber supply en this coast. We have no
such idea as that. We are simply go
ing into the lumber business, and will
stay in it as long as. the lumber com
panies do a passenger business. When
they stop that we will go out of the
lumber trade. One or the other has got
tc get a knockout blow, and, of course,
we don't think we will be that one."

WASHINGTON', Dec. 19. â Dr.
Sheldon Jackson, general agent of the
Bureau of Education, to-day received
a letter from William E. Davis, su
perintendent of public schools at Una
laska, Aleutian Islands, saying that
slavery exists among the population
in the islands. ' "'
In his letter Davis says that slavery
has existed' ln the islands from time
immemorial and that it is still gen
eral. He gives a number of instances
of orphans and waifs- being held as
slaves and, says he has been unable to
make the owners give up their "prop
erty." He asks for Instructions as io
how to deal vith the conditions.
Jackson said to-day that he had
known for some time that slavery ex
isted in the Aleutian Islands and that
Governor Brady* of Alaska had some
time ago taken steps to remedy the
evil. He said the principal offending
slave owners were not Aleutians, but
Americans and foreigners who had
married Aleutian women and among
whom r the possession ' of slaves was
considered a mark of wealth.

BY STATEMENT
The examination continued along the
lines of Alexander's correspondence to
New York from Paris, detailing the
progress of the Paris negotiations. Un
termyer reading a number of expres
sions from the letters that entertained
the audience greatly. It was brought
out that the attitude of Morgan, Harjes
& Co., unfavorable at first to the ship
building proposition, was changed com
pletely after the receipt of the July 30
cablegram and' from G. W. Perkins
announcing that Schwab and his
friends were interested and would be
glad of as favorable a view of it as
possible. Harjes, it appeared, had told
Alexander that he had been unfavor
ably impressed with the shipbuilding
concern because of the character of its
promoter, John W. Young, but Alexan
i der assured him that Young was not
the "whole thing," and intimated his
Intention of cabling Morgan in New
York that he would make his financial
arrangements with some other house if
I the attitude of the Paris branch was
not changed.
It was brought out that $200,000 worth
of shipbuilding securities had been set
aside for the purpose of subsidizing the
French press.
Â¦ The hearing will be resumed next
I Tuesday.
NEW YORK, Dec. 19. â When the
hearing in the United States shipbuild
ing receivership case was resumed
yesterday Untermyer continued his
examination of Charles B. Alexander
of the firm of Alexander & Green. It
Is recognized by counsel that the hear
ing wili extend well into next year,
Untermyer 6aying that he has a num- J
ber of witnesses yet to call in addi
tion to Schwab, Pam and John W. j
Young before the defense begins to
present Its case.
The heariwg opened with a tilt be
tween Guthrie and Untermyer, Guthrie
rising to state for Alexander that none
of the cablegrams which he sent from
abroad during the summer of 1902 in
regard to the selling of securities re
ferred to shipbuilding, and that if Un
termyer desired to "pry into Alexan
der's private business affairs" the ca
blegrams would be opened to his in
spection. Untermyer resented the
phrasing of the statement, and the ex
amination then proceeded.
Untermyer asked if a cable message
in code of July 28, 1902. directing the
New York office to "sell my rights on
my tomb" referred to shipbuilding
stock, but Alexander insisted that ship
building stock was not his "tomb," and
Untermyer augmented the merriment
by asking how "tomb" was spelled.
The cablegrams in question, over
whose admission in evidence so strong
a fight has been made, came to the
knowledge of complaintant's counsel
through Dresser, but not in such a way
that they could be used in evidence
from that source. Alexander continued
his tactics of declining to answer most
questions about correspondence on the
ground that it was privileged. Alexan
der told at length of the connection of
his firm and himself with the early at
tempts to form a shipbuilding concern,
but parried successfully most of Unter
myer's attempts to obtain any impor
tant sensational testimony about the
final attempt.
ROME, Dec. â¢ 19.â At -the- Vatican to
day the. statement of the Tribuna yes
terday that Cardinal Gotti, Prefect of
the Propaganda, had handed Pope Pius
$9,000,000 in bank notes, . said to have
been confided to Cardinal Gotti by the
late Pope Leo with instructions to turn
the money, .over to his successor after
a Derlod of four months, was denied.
On the same authority the statement
of the Tribuna that an electrician
found in a hole in the wall $1,850,000 in
gold or any other treasure also was de
nied.
The press is authorized to .announce
that the truth is that the present Pope
immediately after his ascension to the
throne received $8,400,000, as "indicated
in the part of the late Pope's .will which
was not made public. The delivery of
the money was effected by Cardinals
Gotti, Rampolla and Cretoni, Pope
Leo's.executors, who brought the larger
part of the bonds from the Propaganda,
where they were kept.
of the affair.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â The Alex
andretta affair is believed to be prac
tically settled with satisfaction to all
parties, though there is still a possi
bility that a few days will be required
to arrange the details of the settlement.
The Navy Department to-day received
word that the San Francisco has left
Beirut for Alexandretta, carrying as a
passenger of honor United States Con
sul Davis. The Consul's return in state
is explained by the fact that the Sub
lime Porte, after further investigation,
has accepted the American view of the
unpleasant affair at Alexandretta and
has signified an intention of making
amends. So Consul Davis goes to Al
exandretta to be received with honor
by the local authorities, who will make
proper explanations of the incident.
The State Department has received a
cablegram from * Minister Leishman.
giving the details of the settlement of
the trouble. He says that the Turkish
Government has instructed the Gov
ernor of Alexar.dretta to apologize to
the Consul on hts return there.
United States Minister Leishman has
informally discussed the incident with
Tewflk Pasha, the Foreign Minister,
but he has not yet presented a formal
demand for reparation. The officials
show a desire to arrive at a settlement

Admiral Cotton left Beirut yesterday

There is one thing in San Francisco
that interests travelers besides the world'
renowned- glorious climate, and that is
the' Palace Hotel. It is the monumental
landmark.in the history of San Francis
co"s progress. It is the center of all at
traction â the home of every visitor and
traveler of note who comes to the city.
Palatial! is the expression heard as
one enters the famous court, which, in
keeping with the progressive policy of
the hotel management, has been co'nvert
td into a lounging-room, the finest in the
world. With its very handsome furni
ture in rich upholstering, its tropical
plants in great profusion, andits myriads
of electric lights, it Is, indeed, a veritable
fairyland and a sight never to be forgot
ten. -Especially is this true during the
evening, when music is played and the
celebrated cafe in this court is filled with
men and women busily engaged In-dis
cussing the "subtle crafts of cookery."
Indeed, so popular has this cafe become
of late that the management has found
it necessary to enlarge it, and within a
few days- this improvement will be com
plete. . . . . .
The Empire room, handsome in hang
ings and furniture of green, and set
aside as a parlor exclusively for the lady
guests; the Palm room, furnished in red.
and in the winter converted into a most
beautiful ballroom; the Louis XV 'par
lorin pink and gold, and the ladies' writ
ing room, in restful, green, add much to
the evfer increasing popularity of this
famous hotel.
Then. too. there has recently' been in
stalled a telephone system with a private

RESIDENCE PROPERTIES
Great interest ia manifested by. thÂ«
realty brokers in the total record for
transactions in real estate that San
Francisco will make for the year 1903.
The Buyer and Seller, 'which has Just
issued its annual review, estimates the
realty business of the year at $47,500,
000, approximately. This is an increase
of about $100,000 above the record ot
1902. A comparative table of sales by
years is published by the Buyer and
Seller and from it the following deduc
tions are drawn:
"These comparative figures of the
growth of the real estate market dur
ing the last six years are eloquent in
their exact conciseness. They show
that the amount of the annual trans
actions has increased from 1898 to 1903
i the sum of $36,750,000. This increase is
'Â¦ greater than the annual amount- of
real estate transactions of the past,
with the exceptions of this and last:
year's, even exceeding those of the for
mer phenomenal year of 1890, which
was $36,545,000." j

Coroner's Jury Finds That They Were
Guilty of Gross Xccli^cnce While
Unloading Vessel.
In the inquest yesterday on the
body of Leopold Juzix, a stevedore
who was killed on September 15 on
the steamer Uarda while unloading
cargo, the jury returned a that
the accident occurred "through gros3
neglect on the part of the ship's com
pany or the parties responsible . for
the clearing of the hatches before
work begins."
The evidence showed that a portion
of a hatchway was torn off while a
load was being lifted out o**the hold,
and the grating fell upon, Juzix and
a companion, killing Juzix and seri
ously wounding the other stevedore.

To Remedy Steering Defects.
ThÂ« rudders of the Key route ferry steam
ers S?.n Jose and Yerba Buena have been &
constant source of annoyence since the boats
went Into commission, and their breakdown
has Involved several expensive .Vlay*. W. A.
Boole has found a way to permanently rem
edy what proved to be a structural defect,
and the Yerba Buena. now c:i Bjole't? marina
ways. is having the necessary alterations
made. The original rudder stocks were made
of a composition which failed to stand the
Etraln. Boole is now building at both ends
of the Terba Uuena towboat propeller arches,
which, with the lenirth-nlnK of the ke?I. is
expected to rendfr the steering pear abso
lutely reliable. When the work 'j finished
en the Yerba Buena the San Jose will bj sim
ilarly treated.

Meanwhile the growing array of
commuters is pinning its faith to the
good luck that has carried the boats
safely so often through the trackless
darkness of some pretty thick fogs.
The first suggestion of the light
house board has not been . received
with open arms, all but one of the
ferry captains declaring it to be im
practicable. In the name of Uncle
Sam the lighthouse board offered to
buMd a lighthouse half a mile to the
southward of Goat Island, the South
ern Pacific boats to so to the south
and the Key Route steamers to the
north of the beacon.- This offer, it is
understood, has been declined, but the
lighthouse officials are not satisfied
that the courses of the rival lines can
not be kept clear of each other and
they now have the matter under con
sideration.
The boats of the Key Route are fast
er than some of the Southern Pacific
boats. - Â£omo of the "canary* pilots
like to come into their sap with the
tide. The navigators of Jhe Southern
Pacific prefer to paddle to their
berths against the current. To carry
out these ideas one host takes a south
erly course and the other goes toward
the north star. The yellow and fast
er boat parses the more sober giited
railroad steamer before getting into
position for the sh^oot to the slip an 1
to gain that position crosses and re
crosses the bow of the rival passen
ger carrier] At times the margin left
for this maneuvering is narrow snd
v hile the pilot of the hare may tri
umph in the abasement of the pilot
of the tortoise the passengers on both
boats derive from the operation thrills
not born of joy.
The United States inspectors of
hulls ar.d boilers have witnessed some
of these nerve rocking episode*. The
members cf the lighthouse board have
also partaken of the excitement. Both
branches are now on the scene with
suggestions, the promise of more to
follow and the prospect of some new
and rigid regulations if the sugges
tions are not assimilated.
The local inspectors have ordered
the boats of the Key Route to show
two yellow iights on their forward
smokestack at night and the boats of
the Santa Fe system, plying to Point
Richmond and crossing the courses
of the oth<y ferries, must hereafter
exhibit two blue lights in similar po
sition.
operation the complexity of the situa
tion has increased and with some
months of fo^gy weather in prospect
the always imminent danger of fatal
mishap has increased many fold.
As the boats are operating now
each pilot is the sole judge of the
course of his own boat and as most
of them have different and conflict
ing ideas as to the best way of ap
proaching a slip under the varioua
conditions of the tide, passengers
traveling between the Alameda shore
and Â£an Francisco have been interest
ed if not entertained at some of tho
close shaving involved in the 'carry
ing out of the pilots' ideas.
The United States Government of
ficials whose duty lies with the prob
lems of navigation have been devot
ing their attention to safeguarding the
trans-bay ferry traffic. Since the yel
low boats of the Key Route commenced
The Civil Service Commission has
taken a hand in, the controversy now
going on between the Board of Works
and the Board of Education over the
dismissal of James B. McSheehy, In
spector of school buildings, owing to
lack of funds to do repairing on school
buildings. The Board of Works desires
to retain McSheehy, claiming that his
services are absolutely required to su
pervise necessary repairs to seventy
five school buildings. The Board of Ed
ucation, en the other hand, wants to
keep W. E. Comrr.ary, assistant inspec
tor of school buildings, contending that
he is needed to keep the accounts.
The Civil Service Commission re
quested information regarding Com
mary's duties, with a view of deter
mining the necessity for his retention.
Yesterday the Board of Works sent in
reply the follow! ns communication to
the commission: '

are more of n novelty than anything else at

Mallndas brought $3@4 per chest. Verdel and

but prices of . fancy Â¦ stock were maintained an
dealers .were: not Inclined to force Â«ales. â¢ There
was very little call for Quinces or Persfmmons
and prices were without quotable change.
. The Oranre market wai overstocked ? and

was abundant, but attracted little attention,

WHEAT- Argentine cables reported the crop
damaged by rains, especially In Rosarlo, where
the weather is- rainy, hot and sultry. This was
the only news, from abroad.
Chicago advanced 'from' S2%c to'S34c. Thp
market was active and oversold 'with the "trade
Inclined t<> the bear side. ..An errormoua short
interest is reported. The important development
of the -week has bÂ»en the large buylnp of
Kansas wheat by foreigners, â¢ over v 1 OyO 000
bushels having been taken In two days. ' â¢
The" Chicago" letter of Bolton, de Ruyter &
Co. says: "It was a strong market through
out the .entire .session. .The. dull and un
changed Liverpool market was something of
a disappointment. . but created no selling pres
sure. There seems J to be too much Wheat
contracted" In strong hands find too great a
scattered. short-Interest- to look for much weak
ness. ., The export 1 business the past two or
three days haÂ» shown a decided' Improvement.
The estimate* of the world's shipments for the
week show a falling off. as Is natural with the
closing of Russian ports. . On the whole our
domestic situation seems to be on a healthy
basis. This. being true, .the discount on July
wheat seems a blsr premium In favor of the
buyer. The Russian-Japanese controversy Is
apparently receiving more consideration In
Europe than In this country. The long delay in

The weakness In Cheese is becoming still
more pronounced and some dealers are quoting

Butter continues quiet at the decline already
noted. Stocks are still very large, but- the
trade expect them to move off better during the
coming week, hoping that the decline may
stimulate the demand.

dressed Turkeys were plentiful and Included
much poor stock, which dragged at unsteady

stock was hard to dispose of and sold down to

The Potato market continued quiet for com

ings of Oregon and Salinas Burbanks moved
freely at steadv prices. Holders of Oregon
Burbanks were "firm In their views and were
ant.cipating a higher range of prices for this
week, as the steamer due to-morrow will bring
very light supplies." There were no fresh
Sweets received and what carried-over stock
was offering found ready sale at the previously
quoted rate. Onions were firm at the recently
advanced quotation. Receipts have been very
light of late and the market is slenderly sup
plied with choice offerings. Less than 100 sacks
came In yesterday.
Los Angeles vegetables were offering freely
and met with a good demand, both for local
utfe and shipping account.- Â¦'' Peas and Beans
sold in a small way at a slight advance over
the quotatiens. but the general run of supplies
sold within 'the quoted range. Tomatoes were
abundant, but prices of the Los Angeles arti
cle were well sustained.. Offerings of Bay were
chiefly of poor quality and dragged at easy fig
ures. Egg Plant was very scarce and firmer,
while Green Peppers were in excessive supply
and weak. Hothouse Cucumbers were offering
and met with prompt eale.

The market continues well supplied and quiet.
Chicago was" firm. The letter of Bolton. de
Ruyter & Co. said: "The market Is active and
charply higher. Possibly the strength in grain
contributed, to. come extent, but -the conditions
of supply and demand are, in our Judgment,
sufficient to account for the advancing tenden
cy of thÂ«Â» . market. ReceiptB of hogs are no
larger than last year on the whole, while the
distributive demand is better and prices are
lower. The large packing interests can hardly
hope to attain any great benefits by the bear
campaign. Outside speculative buying is in
creasing and we are inclined to think packers
are accumulating holdings. The market has
had an important rally from low prices and
will probably have reactions. On the reactions
we would buy provisions."

Chicago Grain Market. .
CHICAGO. Dec. 19. â Trading in wheat was j
on a very large scale ar.d the market ehowe<i j
greater activity than for a long while. Local
holders appeared to have the utmost confident
j In the situation. Although the market ad
! vanced to the top Driee on the Dresent crop,
little disposition was manitested to take proflts.
! The extremely liberal export business of the
I past two days and the continued small receipts
caused a good demand at the start. Opening
prices were arm. May belne a shade to }*o
higher at S-'^c to b2%c. Shorts were the best
buyers during the opening hour, although there j
was some buying for investment. Offerings
were very mfater and rnces advanced wltn
the session. Reports of war between Japan and
Russia were rUt among traders and toward the j
end of the first hour the demand had become
general. Shorts became alarmed at the attitude j
of thâ¬ pit crowd, and in renewing efforts to J
! cover added greatly to the strength In the mar
! ket. While there was some liquidation on the i
I advance the effect was slight and closing prices
I were about the best of the day. After selling,
at S34igK3^c. May closed at &3$,@s3fec. a
gain of l L t c.
Com prices were carried up by the strength
in wheat and because of the wet weather pre
vailing all over the central West. May closed
a t 44 Vic.
Oats were strong along with other grains.
| May closed at 374c
Provisions were firm, with considerable out
' side buying still In evidence. The advance met
! with some filing by English houses, but Â¦
prices held up well. The close was strong,
with May pork up 15<gl74c. May lard 5S. 4c
higher and ribs 7 4c better.

NEW YORK, Dec. liâ Early to-day
fire destroyed ' the 'home of William
Muschenheim, at Fort Washington
avenue and One Hundred and Ninety
fifth street, one of the show places
along the Hudson. The occupants nar
rowly escaped with their lives. Musch
enheim carried two servants down : a
ladder from a third-story window.
Just as he opened the door on his re
turn from the city Muschenheim, who
owns a hotel here, heard his wife run
ning down stairs crying "fire." The
house was filled with smoke. The hotel
man caught u:> a telephone and gave
tlje alarm to the operator, . who sum
moned thc department. He then ran
upstairs and dragged the family from
their beds to the open air. The servants
were unable to get down from the third
floor, and two women jumped from the
windows. A ladder was run up and
Muschenheim carried three , other ser
vants down through the flames.
The residence was soon a mass of
flames and was burned to the ground.
As it was richly furnished the loss will
be heavy. The stable of C. JC. G. Bil
lings, owner of Lou Dillon and other
Â¦famous horses, which is not far away,
was for a time J endangered by' the
showers of sparks.

" Edna Josselyn is an actress, who will
open on Christmas day with the "Way
Dowrf East" company in Oakland. Ac
cordingly she was anxious to have a
charge of petty larceny against her
disposed of by Judge Cabaniss, which
he did by dismissing the case. The
complaining witness was W. N. Car
ter; a second cousin of Nick Carter, the
famous sleuth, and himself a skilled
hunter of criminals. He is employed
as a "shadow" by the Pinkerton De
tective Agency. He and Miss Josselyn
had been friends, but quarreled. Then
they made up, and, according to the
testimony of the fair defendant, the
sleuth bought her some, goods for a
dress which cost $9 25. He loaned, her
his suit case and in it she took the dress
goods home with her. Something sub
sequently stirred the spleen of the
"shadow" and he swore to a complaint
charging Miss Josselyn with the lar
ceny of a dress valued .at 545. Judge
Cabaniss issued the warrant, person
ally furnished, bail for fhe' young wom
an, heard the case and dismissed it.
Thus did he minister to his goddess,
Justice. ' ./

A word as to the origin of the name

we would say that during the period

Helen of Troy and ate them. Then he
dozed off in his chair. Aiter two hours
of slumber he arose and started to
leave the restaurant. Anatasco barred
the way. He told the banqueter that
the score was unpaid, which the latter
denied. Anatasco emphasized his de
mand for the money by securing a
stout, unyielding club and whacking
Kilmartin with it. Some of the other
customers interfered and called a po
liceman, who placed the restaurauteur
under arrest. He was charged with as
sault with a deadly weapon In Judge
Fritz's court yesterday. Some testi
mony was taken, which showed that at
best the charge would not be greater
than battery, and Anatasco was â¢ al

will be passed upon him.

Lee Hung is a diminutive Chinese
with a meek and lowly air, who looks
so innocuous that a man looking for a
fighter would pass him by without a
second glance. But there is a member
of the Chintown squad who says that
Lee is a. hooting, tooting terror when he
does cut loose. Policeman Barrett at
tempted to search Lee for lottery tick
ets Friday night, and the Chinaman re
sented the liberty. He fought with hi3
head, hands, teeth, nails and feet. Fin
ally he got hold of a large red brick
and therewith smote the policeman on
the jaw. After he had been "hog-tied"
he was taken to the City Prison and the
suspected lottery tickets were found on
his person. He was up for trial yester
day in Judge Fritz's court, presided
over by Judge Cabaniss during the
former's illness, but the case was con
tinued until to-morrow at the request
of the prosecution.
One of the City's Substantial Insti
tutions.
THE NEVADA NATIONAL BANK.
The Nevada National Bank has always
occupied a commanding position among
the financial concerns of the West. Its
history is one of steady and substantial
growth, while its statements are an ex
hibit of conservative banking and appeal
to the solid financial element of the com
munity. The capital of the Nevada Na
tional Bank is $3,000,000.00. fully paid,
and the surplus "and undivided profits
aggregate J1.4S0.6S4. 10. For fifteen
years after its founding, more than a
quarter of a century ago, the bank was
conducted as a State bank. It was na
tionalized in 1890 under the name of
"The Nevada National Bank of San
Francisco.'* , , M x .
Isaias W, Hellman is president of the
bank, and under his able management it
has become an institution that the busi
ness community turns to with a natural
assurance of safety. The directors names
are prominent ones in the financial
world. Besides Mr. -Hellman there are
James I,. Flood. Leon Sloss. Henry F.
Allen. C. de Guigne. Robert Watt, John
F. Rigelow. William Haas, F. W. Van
Slcklen. I. W. Hellman Jr. and Clarence
Mackay. Mr. Billow and I. W. Hellman
Jr are vice presidents. George Grant
cashier and W. McGavin assistant cash
ier. The Nevada National Bank does a
general banking business, including the
issuance of letters of credit and the buy
ing and selling of excliange. Its state
ment shows that its assets are upward
of $17,000,000.00. and it will always
stand as a bulwark of the financial sta
bility of the Western metropolis.
George Johnson is a soldier man, and
he went abroad on the Barbary Coast
Friday night. In one of the halls of
pleasure in. that justly celebrated dis
trict he objected to the manner in
which Miss Delia Smith was doing a
two-step. It did not comport with his
ideas of grace and poetry of motion, so
he handed her a few wallops. Police
man Dick Skein, who is the personal
representative of law and order on.Pa
cific street, attempted to place the little
boy in blue under arrest. There was
something doing for a while, and those
who saw it said it was about as lively
a mix-up as has ever occurred in such
a short space of time. Johnson was
finally landed in jail and appeared in
Judge Conlan's court yesterday with
his head wrapped up in a blanket, the
outward and visible signs of Policeman
Skein's activity. The complaining wit
ness was unable to appear in court be
cause she was suffering from the in
juries received at the hands of the sol
dier, and the case was continued until
to-morrow.
Frank McCarthy disguised himself in
one erf those nice,. long; yellow oil skin
coats Friday evening, but even beneath
the disguise he was recognized by
"Smiling Silverstein," the veteran de
tective. "Struggle not, Foxy Frank."
he hissed, "for I have a wrist of steel."
The trouble was that the coat did not
belong to McCarthy. He was walking
along Third street in the rain, when
he happened to spy the "slicker" hang
ing in front of Silverstein's place at
business; Â¦ The temptation to enwrap
himself in its waterproof folds was
strong , and the opportunity seemed
good, because apparently no one was
watching. But Silverstein was there
with bells and McCarthy was found
guilty of petty larceny in Judge Me
gan's court yesterday. The rainy sea
son will be over when Frank comes out
again.
CUMMINGS' HARD LUCK
AFFECTS JUDGE CONLAN
trip O'Connor took an unaccountably
long time to deliver the goods. "It's
him to the steam . beer," thought the*
foreman, and he watched his new em
ploye. Th.en he discovered that O'Con
nor was filching the grain. Instead of
depositing the tenth sackHn the ware
house he continued down the alley with
it and bartered it to a second hand
dealer. A tally was .called for and it
was discovered that O'Connor had dis
posed of eight sacks of grain during
three hours of employment. It didn't
require an expert accountant to figure
out that the new hand was not a pay
ing investment for the vinegar .works.
He was convicted of petty larceny in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday and will
be given a rest cure Monday.
Shoots Himself Through the Hand While Trying
to Comply With Law and Is Arrested for Dis^
charging Firearmsâ Frank O } Connor' s Industry
Thomas Cummings appeared before
Judge Conlan yesterday morning on a
charge of discharging firearms . within
the city limits. He had a hard luck
story to tell, and he told it. At the
conclusion of the moving tale the
Judge, too moved to speak, waved the
prisoner to freedom. Friday night Cum
mings came to the city Â¦ from Hunters
Point, where he has been working in a
warehouse. He met a friend near the
Hall of Justice and purcnased from
him a revolver for the sum of 50 cents.
The revolver was loaded, and Cum
mings was unwilling to violate the law
against carrying concealed weapons, so
he attempted to unload it. In doing so
he discharged the weapon, the bullet
passing through his hand. The report
awoke the echoes in the Central police
station and half- a dozen policemen
rushed out, expecting nothing less than
a murder case. When -they found the
cause of the trouble they were so dis
appointed that they locked Cummings
up.
