Columbia River, between The Dalles and
Vancouver. Burke, the forger and es
caped prisoner frcm the Hillsboro Jail.
overpowered the Deputy Sheriff who had
captured him to-day and secured two
revolvers, a rifle ar.d a large supply of
ammunition. His actions and escapades
cf the past few days brand him as a des
perado, ar.d should the posse which Is
row hot on his trail overtake him there
Is little doubt but that a pitched battle
trill er.FUe.
Surke's feats of the past week have
ehcewn that he does not intend to spend
his t'.tne in Jail. Sunday he escaped from
Sheriff Totton of Ska:r.ar.ia County, who
had recaptured him at the hotel at Car-
FO-, Wash. The Sheriff sent a shower of
bullets after the fusitive. but the shots
cpparently tDnly inade the fugitive run
the faster, none cf them taking effect. .
CAPTURE AND ESCAPE.
Sheriff Totton located the escaped man
In the hotel at Carson early Sunday
rnorr.!"F, after he had scoured the coun
try in the vicinity of The Dalles, where
Burke vras reported to have been seen.
The Sheriff captured his man, getting the
<5rop on him. and at once started â¢with
him for the lock-up, the Sheriff riding,
with his g-un trained on the captive, who
walked ahead.
It xczs at a sharp turn In the road that
Burke made his escape. Being ehut for a
second from view he bolted Into the brush
v.ithout the least -warning. The officer
emptied his revolver Into the brush, clip-
I Sng trees right and left and ordering
Burke to halt. But there -was no sound
irom the fugitive.
Sheriff Totton at once rode to the differ
ent eettlernents of the vicinity and left
Instructions that a sharp lookout be kept
for the man. Every available officer was
put en his trail, with the result that a
Deputy Sheriff from Lower Cascades
came upon him to-day and arrested him
in the brush near that settlement. Burke
v.-as unarmed and did not resist, especial
ly when the officer thrust a gun In his
face.
STHTJGOLE TOB WEAPON.
Burke's eyes were bloodshot and he
showed the hardships of running through â¢
the forests all night and day without
food. Apparently he was quite docile,
and the officer etarted with him for Cas
cade Locks to place him in confinement
tot safe-keeplrg.
But Burke was merely biding his
chance. When officer and captive had Â¦
talked sornV distance and got on fairly j
friendly terms Burke suddenly seized the
deputy end a terrific struggle ensued.
Both men fought for every inch there
v.as in them, but Burkes strength was
pupplemented by desperation ar.d h^
struggled like a demon until he had the
deputy overpowered. He then helped j
himself to the officer's rifie, revolvers i
and ammunition, bade "him a sarcastic
adieu and disappeared in the brash down
the river.
Burke is the man who swindled a
Polk County citizen out of about $250 at
Dalles, and tried the came swindle at
Forest Grove. He is also wanted for
forgery In Martinez, Cal.

NEW YORK. Sept. 22.â Coroner Brown,
who Is investigating the death of John

man fcund dead, shot through the heart.
In his apartments yesterday, has aban
doned the theory of suicide and to-day
called epon the police to investigate the
ehooting on the possibility that It might
have been murder. The position of the
revolver, the fact that Kilpatrlck' s cJoth-
Ir.g was not burred and the absence of
any escertalnable cause for suicide, led
the Coroner to say that he believed the
ehooting to have been either accidental or
murder.
Coroner Brown added that the theory
that Kilpatrlck had committed suicide be
cause he was suffering from kidney
trouble or because he had lost his fortune
In speculation was disproved, the autopsy
chowlng that he had no kidney trouble
and Investigation proving that his specu
lations had been profitable.

treaty was - dead, although
eight hours yet remained within whlcn
the Colombian Congress might take ac
tion upon it. Nothing, however, had been
received during the day either from Min
ister Beaupre at Bogota, or from Herran,
the Colombian Charge d' Affaires here,
which gave the slightest hope of a fav
orable Issue.
A report is current here that the Colom
bian Congress, In secret session, had
clothed President Marroquln with full
power to negotiate a treaty. If this re
port should turn out to^be true President
Marroquln. "who Is counted as a friend Of
the treaty, could proceed untrammeled
try the fear of future reckoning with liis
Congress.
In any event President Roosevelt must
now take the next step. He can elect to
proceed under, the Bpooner act and take
up the Nicaragua route or he can allow
the matter to drift for the present, In
the hope that a way may yet be found
to straighten out the present difficulty
in the path of the Panama route.
Contrary to his custom during the sum
mer. Acting Secretary Adee of the State
Department remained in the city to-day
in order to be on hand to act promptly
on any information which might come
from Beaupre regarding canal affairs In
Bogota. Up to a late hour to-night, how
ever, nothing had been received. Dr.
Herran, the Colombian Charge, also
waited anxiously for news from his Gov
ernment, but likewise was disappointed.
Colombia, it is known, is anxious to
keep alive the canal negotiations. What
form her new proposition with that end
in view will take is not known in Wash
ington.
One interesting feature in connection
with the legislative situation in Colom
bia Is the fact that the terms \. one
third of the members in the Senate, num
bering nine, will expire on the 20th of
next July, when the life of the present
Congress will end. These nine Senators,
it is said, are averse to the canal treaty.
The hope of the advocates of the treaty
will be to elect Senators in their places
who are favorable to the convention, it
Is expected that the campaign for the
Legislature will be made with this end
in view.

BERLIN, Sept. 22.â Full details have
just reached the German-Jewish relief
committee of the anti-Jewish outbreak in
Homel, near Mohiley, the chief town of
the Russian province of that name.
"Workingmen's homes to the number of
345 have been plundered and destroyed,
twenty-five Jews were either killed out
right by the soldiery or died of their
wounds, 100 more are In the hospitals,
sc-riously injured, while 200 others are suf
fering, from Blighter wounds â¢ received
through the Brutality ! of the j police or
while defending themselves against Chris*
tian assailants.
The authorities watched the progress
of the rioting and pillaging- with com
plalsancy.
The trouble began on September li,
â¢when Christian market dealers sought to
buy herring from Jewish peddlers at a
tenth of the market price. The Jews re
fusing 1 to submit to the robbery, the
Christians proceeded forcibly to despoil
them.
On the second day of the riot, when the
Jews disregarded Instructions to keep off
the streets, because they coifld no longer
restrain themselves from going to the
rescue of outraged women and tortured
men, the soldiers flred a volley Into a
crowd of Jews, killing six of them.
- The' disturbances continued until Sep
tember During the rioting one Chris

served to stiil further incease the popu
lace. The rioting continued for six days.
Quiet has now been restored, â¢ but the
town is under martial law, factories are

ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Sept. f 22. âFour
masked men at 10 o'clock to-night held up
westbound Burlington and Missouri River
train No. 41, five miles north of this city.
The safe in the express car was dyna
mited and the car wrecked. Officials of
the road say that the safe contained but
little money. ''Other reports say that It
contained J3O0O to $10,000 in money. Every
thing in the safe was taken and the men
escaped in the darkness with horses. A
posse was organized and Is in pursuit of
the bandits.
Not a single shot was fired. The train
v.*as stopped by ir.eans of a red light. The
engine and express car were uncoupled
from the balance of the train and backed
half a mile further on, where it was dyna
mited. The train was in charge of Con
ductor Harvey, who hurried to the city
and gave the alarm. The officials lost no
time in organizing and making a start.
It was necessary for the entire train to
be brought back to the city and a new
train made up, which left at 1 o'clock-
According to meager reports received
from the scene of the hold-up at midnight,
the instant the train was stopped two of
the robbers climbed upon the engine and
with drawn weapons compelled the en
gineer and fireman to obey orders. One
of the uncoupled the engine and ex
press car from the balance of the train.
The party then climbed into the cab and
the engine and car were run up the track.
The explosion followed.
The train was crowded with passengers
for thÂ» West and the hold-up created &
panic. It was in charge of Conductor
Harvey of St. Joseph. As soon as he saw
the robbers he ran back down the track
and secured a handcar, on which he came
to St. Joseph and notified the officers. Po
licemen and deputy sheriffs to the num
ber of fifty were taken at once to the
scene, armed with riot guns, but the rob
bers had finished their work and de
parted.
One of the robbers is reported to havs

REDWOOD CITY, Sept. 22.âProceed
ings for the incorporation of the town of
Colma came to an abrupt termination be
fore the Board of Supervisors to-day.
The instigators of the scheme admitted
their, own defeat, which was brought
about by the very persons who signed the
.petition to incorporate but a few weeks
ago. Twenty persons who had favored
the proposition withdrew" their names
from the petition, leaving less than fifty
names . thereon. These twenty persons,
fipon mature consideration, became satis
fied that incorporation was not what they
wanted, many of them stating that they
had signed the petition under a misap
prehension of facts.
"When It was made to appear to the
Board of Supervisors that but forty-four
names remained on the petition, the fol
lowing order was made:
"Tha evidence being closed, and the
matter submitted to the board, and It ap.
pearing from the evidence herein that
there are less than fifty qualified signers
remaining upon said petition presented
and considered herein, on motion of Su
pervisor McEvoy, seconded by Supervisor
McCrackin, it is found, ordered and de
clared that said petition Is not sufficient
In 'law to authorize this board to proceed
further thereon, wherefore it is therefore
ordered that said petition be and the
same is hereby denied."
It Is extremely doubtful whether fifty
persons can be found at Colnia to-day
who now favor Incorporation, certainly
the proposition can never be carried
should It ever be submitted to a vote.
' But ' little time was consumed by the
board to-day, before the members were
called upon to act. H. W. Br\wn, who
has taken an active part in the defeat of
the measure, presented communications
from twenty persons asking that their
names be stricken from the petition. Sev
eral witnesses were called by Mr. Brown
to prove the signatures of these persons.
Nothing then remained but for the other
side to admit that they werejbeaten, it
being conceded that the parties had the
right to withdraw their names. It Is pos
sible that another effort will be made to
secure what has been twice lost, but the
chances are that the incorporation hi

climbing Scafell Mountain, in Cumberland, to

The company goes on in its complaint
and recites several mining deals in which
Chambers is accused of having fraudu
lently obtained large sums of money.
Notable among these was the deal con
cerning the Afterthought copper proper
ty in this county.
The company claims it had Chambers
go from here to Salt Lake City to secure
an option on the Afterthought in a sum.
not to exceed $150,000; that he "entered
into a conspiracy with W. F. Snyder and
one Mitchell," by the conditions of which
Snyder took the title to the Afterthought
in the sum of $90,000, gave an option to
the Great "VVestern at $150,000 and when
the company made the first payment of
$20,000, Snyder paid $10,000 to the owners
of the Afterthought and $10,000 was divid
ed among Snyder, Mitchell and Chambers.
Several other alleged Irregular trans
actions are charged against Chambers.
The suit attracts much attention here
and probably will have the same result in
Salt Lake City, where Snyder is at the
head of the Western Exploration Com
pany, a prominent mining concern.
Chambers says there is no ground for the
suit, which he declares to be brought for
blackmail.

Roberts,' Suit Against
Fresno Democrat
on at Madera.
MADERA, Sept. 22.â The case of Rob
erts vs. the Fresno Democrat Publishing
Company was called in the Superior
Court here to-day. This action is brought
against the newspaper by Dick Roberta,
on account of an alleged libel published
in the Democrat about the beginning
of this year. Plaintiff considers that his
reputation was injured to the extent or
575,000.
At that time it was said that burglars
had broken Into the homes of Roberts
and Sheriff Thurman. Young Roberts'
gun and hat were found in the home of
the Sheriff after an unknown had made
his escape. The theory advanced in all
the stories that were sent out from Ma
dera at the time was that the outlaw had
nrst entered the Roberts' home and stolen
the articles which he left in the Thur
man residence.
Some days after the democrat sent
a man to Madera and a story .followed
which inferred very strongly that Rob
erts had himself carried that gun and hat
into the Thurmari residence. On this
story Roberts bases his suit for dam
ages. To-day was spent In securing a
jury. . â¢

THE ACCUSATION
Grafid Commander
"Wood of Portland
Arrested.
Federal Officials Accuse Him
of Making False Cer
tificates.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or.. Sept. 22. â Captain
Thomas A. Wood, grand commander of
the Society of Indian War Veterans of
the Northwest and the man who was In
strumental In securing the passage of the
Indian War Veteran pension bill by Con
tress, was arrested by Deputy United
States Marshal Proebestel this morning
on charges of pension fraud.
The arrest was made upon an affidlvlt
eworn to by W. A- Pless, special exam
iner of pensions, who came out from
Washington to Investigate charges
against Captain Wood some time ago Of
procuring false affidavits and certiflcates
in three pension claims. According to
the statements of Federal officers, the ac
cusation in at least one of the cases is a
grave one.
It' is understood that the official eye of
the pension department has been focused
upon Wood for some time, or at least
eince there was considerable talk a few
veeks ago relative to supposed scandals
in connection with the local end of the
pension getting process.
The list of charges, among other things,
alleges that 'Wood assisted In procuring
a pension for Rose B. Richards, secur
ing the signature of Brazil Grounds as a
vitnesa to the eignature of the claimant,
inducing him to make affidavit that he
â¢was present when the woman signed
her name, when in fact he was not.-
Another charge is that in the latter
part of July Wood induced Rush Menden
hall to sign a blank affidavit which was
subsequently used in a pension claim.
The affidavit further charges fraud in the
procuring of a certificate in the claim of
one Mary Prather and that he collected
fees In all cases. Wood was arraigned
before Commissioner Sladen this morn
ing and released on $1000 bonds. His
hearing will be had next Tuesday.

BERLIN, Sept. 22.â An extensive sys
tem of targets that fire with blank cart
ridges upon a firing line using real cart
ridges was tested to-day on the drill
grounds of the Queen Elizabeth regiment,
grenadier guards. The targets, which are
rhaped like the bodies and heads of men,
armed with rifles, machine guns and artil
lery, appear and disappear at the will of
the commanding officer on touching a
button in electrical connection with the
targets.
The problem of the firing line is to make
as many hits as possible on these targets,
which are irregularly visible, and at the
same time simulate the condition of ac
tual war by keeping up a hot blank cart
ridge lire upon the practicers. The appar
atus, which was invented by First Lieu
tenant Tschirschky, Is expensive, as It
Uses up much ammunition, but in the
opinion of the numerous high officers
present the trials are admirable adapted
to instill composure in the firing line.

SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 22.â The Super
visors of Marin County are seriously con
templating the closing of the county high,
way known as the "hill load" leading
from San Rafael to San Quentin prison.
Some time ago the State Board of Prison
Directors, through Directors J. H. WU
kins and C N. Felton, appeared before
the Supervisors and asked that the road
be closed and made private, claiming It
was for best Interests of the State in
general to grant this wish.
The hill road has been a public highway
since 1854 and is the main driveway to
tlie penitentiary, passing directly in front
of the prison. For this reason it is easy,
so it is claimed, for ammunition, guns or
opium to be cached by evil doers along
this road and ultimately passed inside
the prison walls, thereby precipitating an
outbreak or at least Insubordination
among the inmates. Several times before
the Prison Directors have attempted to
have this highway abolished and as far
back as 1E93 took the matter into court.
The county, however, won out. After the
Folsom outbreak the matter was thought
of more favorably and to-day, the Super
visors, investigated a proposition whereby
the state offers to build another road for
the county.

Miss Rayl came to this city from. Wells
vllle, Ohio, some time ago to take up the
work of nursing with her brother, who is
a physician, and entered a training
school for nurses almost immediately up
on her arrival. The only known cause
for self-destruction, if the death of the
young woman proves to have been such,
was a disappointment in a love affair at
Wellsville and this also i3 said to have
been the cause of Miss Rayl leaving her
home city.
The belief of the police that she was
not murdered and her body placed on the
track agrees with that of the Coroner
and a second physician, who performed
the autopsy upon the body, neither of
whom Inclines to the theory of murder.
Notwithstanding their belief that the case
is one of suicide, the police are still work
ing on it and will continue to do so until
further effort in that direction seems use
less.

which surrounds the terrible death of the

LONDON. Sept. 22.â The question re
garding the accuracy of the shooting of
the British cruiser Powerful's 4.7-inch
guns, which, it is claimed, saved Lady
smith from capture by the Boers, has
been brought to the front in a sensational
manner by Rear Admiral Lambton, who
gained much condemnation for conveying
the naval guns to Ladysmith Just before
the garrison was shut up by the Boers.
In his evidence before the South Afri
can War Commission, General Sir Arch
ibald Hunter, now commander of the
forces in Scotland, who passed through
the siege, declared that the practice with
the naval guns was so bad that he "of
fered to take the boys out of school, who
would serve the guns and make as good
practice."
Admiral Lambton has now published a
statement to the effect that immediately
after he saw General Hunter's evidence
he wrote only to the Admiralty demand
ing an unreserved apology from General
Hunter. Admiral Lambton asks the news
papers to abstain from comment pend
ing developments.

Tovar has been appointed commander of the
Atlantic and Pacific fleets of Colombia.
The Papyrus Club will entertain on
Thursday at 2:30 p. m. at Utopia Hall.
The clever women of this club at all
times have much to offer in the way of
wit and goodfellowship, but this first of
their fall "affairs promises to scintillate
with â¢> gleams of humor. Madame Semi
nario is going to render one of her de
lightful solos and Mr. McNaught Is going
to talk, on "Woman's Clubs." As they
are all wondering what he knows about
them and how he found out what -he
knows, the clubwomen are eager to hear
him. 'Â£ii&3Â£gliÂ£i!JSÂ£g5^
The wedding of Miss Alice Donovan to
Dr. William Hopper will occur at St.
Mary's Cathedral on October 1. A recep
tion will follow at the Sorosis Club rooms,
to which about fifty guests will be bidden.
Miss Donovan is a girl of fine mentality
and a close student of music. The groom
Is prominently 'connected with many
clubs in this city and is looked upon by
his fellow professionals as unusually pro.
gressive in the Held of medicine.
Â¦ The afternoon will surely prove a pleas
ant memory to the president during her
task laden days of the future, as the club
calendar is heavy with self created tasks.
Yesterday was president's day at the
California Club. A throng of handsome,
well gowned women gathered In the club
rooms to do honor to the president, Mrs.
George Law Smith, who received the
greetings of about 400 guests and mem
bers. Mrs. Smith, by her tact and per
sonality, has succeeded in welding her
large organization ltno a pleasant family
ârather Mormonistic in proportions, per
haps, but bound together by ties of
mutual regard and common interests. It
w as this affectionate regard that drew
together the largest audience of the pres
ent session and that promoted the senti
ment of goodfellowship among the mem
bers.
The president took occasion to an
nountie that on Saturday evening next
the California Club will hold a mass
meeting at Lyric Hall, Eddy street, for
the purpose of exploiting the bond issue
question. Senator J. R. Knowland will
preside over the gathering and Samuel
Shortridge, William Alvord, G. B. Ben
banr and P. H. McCarthy will deliver
short addresses. The president urged her
fair hearers to attend and not only to
perform that duty, but to bring their
friendsâ men friends, of course, whose
opinions have a tangible value.

The engagement appears to be one of
the pleasant results of automoblling â and
there seem to be some that are pleasant.
Miss Landers during the. summer aston
ished Monterey sojourners by her daring
Tarn o' Shanter rides in the "red devils"
and by her excursions in the auto of Mr.
Whittell, who holds a Lou Dillon record
for speed in his car. Mr. Whittell has
been an ardent devotee of the new style
of locomotion and has developed a pro
ficiency almost Parisian in propelling his
machine. He Is considered a capital fel
low and his friends are showering him
with congratulations at having won so
dainty a maid as Miss Landers.
Miss Landers, as is well known, is a
cousin oÂ£ Mrs.' Jack Johnson of Los An
geles, she who was the charming Berlnice
Landers.
Another bit of news for the smart set
it that Miss Pearl Landers, daughter of
John Landers â the dainty, daring and
chic Miss Pearlâ Is to be married within a
year. To whom? To George F. Whittell,
son of George Whittell, the capitalist, of
1155 California street.
The young people have been the recip
ients of a flood of congratulations. While
the exact date is not set for the wedding
it will probably occur before the holi
days.
The' engagement is announced of Miss
Adelaide Deming, daughter of E. O. Dem
ing, to Robert Mein of Oakland. The
friends of both these popular young peo
ple have been long anticipating this pleas
ant denouement and are correspondingly
happy.
Miss Deming is a dashing type ot-West
ern womanhoodâ svelt, stunning and
clever. With a wealth of Rubens hair,
she possesses the individuality that Is an
accompaniment of that type.
Mr. Mem is the son of the late wealthy
mining engineer of South Africa, whose
enterprises distinguished him during the
first rush to the gold fields. The mother
of the prospective groom is a resident of
Oakland, where she still maintains the
line old family home.
Ayres and Mr. Searles is without doub
one of the cleverest summer coups oi
Cupid.
The wedding will occur in January.

Swenyon asked a passing driver for a
ride and rode Into the village with him.
He had scarcely arrived in Oyster Bay
when he was taken from the wagon by
two secret service officers and examined.
Swenyon had nothing in his pockets ex
cept about $4 in money and a Swedish re
ligious newspaper. On a piece of paper
he wrote his name and address in a per
fectly legible hand. He says he lived at
the Sayszerry Hotel, New York City. His
only object in coming to Oyster Bay, he
said, was to see Sagamore Hill and the
President, about whom he had heard and
read a great deal. He arrived here on the
3:19 train this afternoon, but did not have
a return ticket to New York. After exam
ining thoroughly the officers were con
vinced that he was entirely .harmless and
that he neither was an anarchist nor a
Socialist. He readily acceded to the sug
gestion of the officers that he leave the
village. They accompanied him ! to the
station and he bought his own ticket to
Isew York. He left on the 6:07 train,
6haking hands with the officers before he
entered the car.
OYSTER BAY, Sept. 22.â A suspicious
character, giving his name as Samuel
Swenyon, w-as held up by the secret ser
vice officers at Sagamore Hill late 1 this
afternoon while making an effort to see
the President. He was turned back to the
village, shadowed, stopped in Oyster
Bay, searched and later placed on a
train for New York. He was unarmed
and appeared to be a harmless crank,
possibly a religious fanatic. .
Swenyon. who Is a slightly built man
of about 35 years, with a reddish brown
beard and mustache, blue eyes and a
strong foreign cast of countenance,
walked up the raodway leading to Saga
more Hill about 4:30 this afternoon. His
clothes were badly torn in several places.
He was stopped by. a secret service offi
cer. He told the officer that he was a
Swede and had come from New YorkUo
see the President and Sagamore Hill,
having read about the President's sum
mer home in the newspapers. A short
time befoje the President, accompanied
by Mrs. Roosevelt, had gone from the
house to the woods near by to chop
wood, that being a favorite exercise of
his. The man was turned back by the
officer, who told him the President was
not at home. He said he was a gardener
and looked curiously about the grounds
and then started on his return to the
village. He was followed by another of
ficer in one of the President's road
wagons. "

CHICAGO, Sept. 22.â A Russian decree
of divorce has been held to be valid by
Judge Gibbons of the Circuit Court of
this city. Max Graber, a Russian He
brew, was married nineteen years ago to
Sarah Gratir. He came to the United
States, his wife refusing to follow him.
After remaining in this country five years
he returned to Russia and his wife de
manded a divorce and 800 rubles, the ante
nuptial settlement.
Graber came back to America, and when
he had saved the money sent It to her.
He then married again. The first wife
came to Chicago and demanded more
money. Graber refused to give any. She
thereupon had him arrested for bigamy.
He was tried and found guilty.
Sentence, however, was suspended. His
attorney, however, then made up a case
to test the validity of the Jewish decree
called "Get" granted in Russia, the di
vorce obtained having been banded over
to her by a council of rabbis in solemn
session in 'Russia, according to the Rus
sian laws. Judge Gibbons held that in
the absence of any proof of fraud the
decree was valid and must be recognized
by the courts of Illinois.

Of the new Pontiff the Cardinal spoke
in terms cf the greatest enthusiasm. He
said that the choice of the conclave had
been most happy from an American view
point, as Pius X.was deeply interested in
the development of the church in this
country and was s;naUlarly # fa?niMar with
American institutions. The' Cardinal had
several lengthy interviews with the Pope
recarding church affairs in this country.
The Cardinal was not inclined to dis
cuss the probable policy of the- n?w papal
regime, but said that no radical changes
in American church administration would
ensue. He said that one of the first steps
by Pius was to instruct his acting Secre
tary of State, Mgr. Merry del Val. to pro
vide for an extensive exhibit of the Vati
can treasures at the St. Louis Exposi
tion. He said the exhibit wouM probably
comprise some of the magnificent jubilee
gifts of the late Pontiff and a number of
rare historical manuscripts and maps
from the Vatican library relating to the
early settlement and mission work in the
Louisiana purchase territory, most of
which was penetrated by Catholic mis
sionaries within a quarter of a century
oT the discovery of the continent./
Asked about the possibility of another
American Cardinal teing .appointed, Car
dinal Gibbons answered: "There will be
another Cardinal. It wouid not surprise
me to see the number of American Car
dinals augmented in the near future. But
there is absolutely no truth in the cabled
statement that the Pcpe purposes to
create a patriarchate for the Occident.
The statement is ridiculous."
To the Passionist Fathers the Cardinal
brought a special bJesslng from Pope
Pius X in response to the message of love
and congratulation sent to the Pope by
them at the time of his election.
Concerning the probable relations be
tween the new Pope and the Italian Gov
ernment, Cardinal Gibbons said:
The Pope as Patriarch of Venice was on
very friendly terms with the King, but what &
man does when he is a mere private In the
ranks, so to ?p<?ak. and when lie is elevated
to power and respomlbility are wholly different
thir.s^. What Pius X Will do in this matter
is. of course, unknown. You may rely on it.
however, there will te r.o suiiden change.
Those thines are not dene In a way to attract
tttentlon. If a chanre does take place It will
be e. gradual change. The friendliness between
the Vatican and the Qulrlnal wil] grow.
Pius X is not the Patriarch of Venice and
while he may retain his friendly feelings for
the King, these feelings will cause no sudden
change of papal policy, but will probably In
the course of time brine about Improved re
lationship and a better state of things. The
King, I believe, is Influenced by very friendly
fet lings toward the Pcpe.
The Cardinal will remain in this city, a
guest at the home of Mrs. Kelly of
Brooklyn, until Friday, when he will ac
company the delegation to Baltimore.
When the welcoming party boarded the
Kaiser Wilhelm off quarantine Mr. Tib
bett made an address of welcome, to
which the Cardinal briefiy responded.
Another reception awaited the Cardinal
when ho went ashore at Hoboken. The
Tier was crowded with ecclesiastical
friends from this city. This afternoon the
Cardinal went to Brooklyn. He had a
pleasant voyage and he said the ocean
trip had recuperated his strength, which
had been greatly taxed by the 3evere spell
of fever he suffered, due to the Intense
heat in Rome during the progress of the
conclave.
Heading the delegation were Rev. Dr.
J. D. Stafford of Washington and Rev. B.
Singleton of Baltimore and R. B. Tib
bett of Baltimore, supreme president of
the Catholic Benevolent Lodse.
NEW YORK. Sept. 22.â Cardinal Gib
bons arrived here to-day on the Kaiser
Wilhelm der Grosie. A delegation of
priests and laymen from Baltimore went
down the bay on a revenue cutter to greet
him and welcome him home.
-OTTAWA, Ont.. Sept. 22.â F. H. Clerge,
the promoter of .the Soo industries, is
here. When asked if the statement that
he was going' to straighten matters out
was true, he replied:
The Soo slant will be running soon. We
will ray our debts and will have the plant
running as good as ever. This closing down
was done without the knowledge of the direc
tors of the company. When the works shut
down th?y were earning $170,000 per month
net. and only a part of the plant was run
ning.
I think the Influence of the company should
be sufficient to offset any unfriendly attitude
taken by any large rival stÂ»el interest. As to
the receivership, I do not see what could be
grained by our filing an application at this tlmÂ».

NEW \v/RK, Sept. 22.â Notice of the

at auction the assets of the company, held
by them as collateral for the loan was
to-day sent by Speyer & Co. to the offi
cers of the company. The details of the
sale have not yet been made public.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 22.â The stock
holders and the executive committee of
the consolidated Lake Superior Company
held a conference here to-day to decide
upon a plan of procedure. A member of
the committee said:
If Scey*r & Co. have decided to foreclose on
the property It Is by agreement of the man
agement. A sale is a necessary part of the
reorganization plan, and only a sale will put
the reorganization in. a position in which they
can say to the stockholders: "You must
either pay an assessment or loss your Inter
est. V
The jurors aprecd among themselves rot
to divulce the proceedings in the jury
room. One jurcr, however, said that for
f^ur ballots eleven jurors voted for the
death penalty and one for a life penalty.
All agreed on the fifth ballot.
This was the second trial of Curtis Jett
on the charge of murder. In his first
trial fnr the murder of J. E. Marcum in
Jackson. Ky.. Jeit and Thomas White
Brer* sentenced to life imprisonment.
The Jury retired at 2:<4 o'clock. When
it re-entered the courtroom at 5:10 o'clock,
after having agreed en a verdict, quiet
reigned for a few minutes. Jett's mother
had gone away earlier, under the im
pression that no verdict wculd be reached,
;ir.d the verdict of death, comine about
two hours after the jury retired, was a
*urrri?e to every one in the courtroom.
The reÂ»dln* of the verdict did not affect
jctt. but his brother was very much dis
tressed.
Elijah McKir.ne-y served as foreman of
the jury. After the delivering of the ver
dict to the court the jury vras polled.
Ti-.e death sentence was then read to
Jett by Clerk T. J. Robinson, after which
be was civen over to the custody of the
Deputy Sheriffs. Cclonel Blanton. Jetfs

An important real estate transaction

Banker Sells Residence.
Notwithstanding that the committee on
platform was so retlctnt the fact became
generally known that the <iuest!cns of the
bond issue and the city ownership of the
Geary-street Railroad were not decided
upon. It was thought besf- by the com
mittee to leave theso disputed topics to
be fought out In the convention.
"What the general committee of the
United Republican League did in the mat
ter of slate-making can be only prob
lematical also. Of all the rumors which
were circulated among the delegates the
most persistent was that Van der Nalllen
was to be the candidate Tor Public Ad
ministrator and that Aigeltinsrer was to
have a place on the Board of Supervisors
from the Thirty-eighth District. It was
also said that Griff was to supplant
O'Nell in the race for the County Clerk
ship.

committee on organization and one cal
culated to effect the position of onÂ© or
more candidates for Superviso* 13 tho

that no one who haa been nominated by
another party can be a candidate for any
office on the Republican ticket.
GBIIT FOB COUNTY CLERK.
The committee on platform was very
secretive over the results of Its labors.
What the main planks In Its propaganda
are to be was left very problematical
by the close-mouthed members. Chair
man Charles Sonntag 1 of thi3 committee
vouchsafed the following statement con
cerning the general character of tha
platform:
Of course, wa are all pledged to secrecy aa
to the contents of the platform, but I will
say that it is one which is bound to go through
without any strong 1 opposition, since It em
braces the principles of every faction in tha
Republican party. Also you may say that It
absolutely was not cut and dried before our
meeting. TVe had petitions from improvement
clubs, suggestions of politicians and even the
little grrafts of ward politicians handed to us
for our consideration and we made up our col
lection of planks from these materials, chocs
tng what the majority thought was right.
This la the first committee on platform that
I ever had anything to do with which sat
down to Its labors absolutely untrammelnl.
I think that our efforts will satisfy the party.
WILL SATISFY PARTY.
Three committees of the league met Ui
private conference at 16 Geary street and
as a result of their labors, the order cf
business for the convention was drawn
up and the party platform constituted.
As the committee on permanent organi
zation for the convention has it. the nom
ination for JIayor will be the first busi
ness of the assemblage to-morrow night.
For the nomination of Supervisors, the
chairman of the convention will appoint a
committee of nine, one from each Sena
torial district, who will make a slate from
the sixty-five names presented to the con
vention by the districts and present It to
the convention after the other municipal
offices have been disposed of.
The expected failed to materialize last
night. In that Abo Ruef did not make his
formal withdrawal from the support of
the nominee of the Republican party for
Mayor in favor of Schmitz. It ia now ex
pected that ho will make this withdrawal
publicly at the time when the conven
tion makes the nomination of the man to

lost by a vote of 231% to 113% votes.
More motions to adjourn followed
after come business Intervened, bat
the chairman ruled them out of order on
the ground that they were not made In
good faith.
Chairman Cannon of the committee on
platform was ordered to present his re
port and he mounted the platform for the
purpose.. He had to wait for some time
until O'Donnell and Choynski raised all
kinds of points of order and asked for
all kinds of Information. - Chairman
Hlckey lost his temper for the nonce and
If the chairman of this convention, haa au
thority to appoint forty members of the next
county committee to whom will they owe al
legiance, to the voters of this city, to any
district in San Francisco, or to the power that
appoints them? If they are elected by the
different delegations represented in this con
vention they will owe allegiance to tha dis
tricts from which they are chosen. Do you
believe for one instant that a committee that
has a large portion appointed by the chairman
of the organization will adhere as strictly to
Democratic principles as one elected by the
representation here to-night on the floor of
thl3 convention? I do not think they will. If
you want to give us an honest and fair county
committee, if you want to go out into this
coming municipal fight with a prospect of
winning it, you have got to start right at the
beginning. Pe;-sonally it is immaterial to me
what you do. but as a representative of the
Democrats of the Thirty-sixth Assembly Dis
trict I propose to go upon record here this
evening as raising my voice in opposition to
the chairman of this organization appointing
anybody on the county committee. My delega
tion I believe, is with me. almost to a man
in favoring committees being elected
by the different delegations here represented.
George E. Gallagher took the platform
to argue in favor of the adoption of the
amendment. He created a great deal of
merriment by his droll remarks. Gal
lagher took the delegates Into bis con
fidence and advised them to vote for the
amendment. He was interrupted time
and again, but held his place on the plat
form. Throughout the uproar Chairman
Hickey pounded the anvil until the con
vention hall sounded like a boiler factory
in full operation.
The amendment was lost by a vote of
21&% to 120*i.
The "Horses and Carts" then adopted
filibustering tactics. Colonel Choynski
grew hoarse yelling for recognition. He
moved that the original motion. ; which
was to adopt the report, be deferred un
til the next meeting. Upon motion of
Robert Boyd an attempt was made to lay
it on the table. Chairman Hickey tried
to have the motion to lay on the table
adopted by a viva voce vote, but his plan
met with opposition. A rollcall was de
manded and the chairman of the Twenty
eighth District caused an uproar by vot
ing his delegation against laying Choyn
ski's motion on the table. He saw his
mistake too late and the "Horses and
Carts" howled over his discomfiture.
Points of order, questions of Informa
tion and demands for rollcalls came with
such frequency that Hlckey became dizzy.
He pounded on the anvil for order, but
never got it. He yelled himself hoarse,
but his voice could not be heard above
the uproar. JVhenever he ruled, the
minority, led by Joseph E. O'Donnell or
Choynski, would threaten to take an ap
peal from the chair. At last a rollcall
was secured and â¢ Choynski's motion was
laid on the table by a vote of 216% to
122H- Joseph - Cummlngs then moved the
previous question.
MOTION FOR A BECESS.
Robert Boyd was recognized by the
chairman and he/ took occasion to speak
in favor of the report. He denounced the
efforts of Messrs. Cook and Choynski to
belittle the majority. He favored the
adoption of the ' amendment. John H.
Mullln of the Thirty-sixth Assembly Dis
trict was heard from at this Juncture.
He started to say unkind things I about
Mr. Boyd, but was stopped by a point of
order made by Eustace Culllnan. He
then talked to the amendment before the
house.
In part he spoke as follows:
labors to ripen into some good fruit, into some
Democratic victory, you must give us a Demo
cratic platform, you must steer by Democratic
principles. You cannot expect the Democrats
of those districts that I have named to stand by
your ticket unless you show them that you are
a ' Democratic convention, that this is not a
Scotch highball, but a meeting of Democrats for
the purpose of showing that there are Demo
crats in San Francisco interested In Democratic
success. The Democrats with whom I am ac
quainted in the city and county of San Fran
cisco, and I am proud to say that I was rocked
in the Democratic cradle, nursed in the Demo
cratic lap, educated In a Democratic school
and have been in every Democratic convention
â will not permit one man, even though he be
divided Into 204 parts, to control the- destiny
of the Democratic party. Gentlemen, you
must support that amendment or you will find
that tha Democratic party Is further away
from the grand results we hope to achieve that
it ever yet has been.

that there would be a clach between the em

Mayor Schmitz Â¦was then called upon
for a speech and he received a warm wel
come at the hands of his supporters.
In part he said:

For the office of Tax Collector Miles L.
.Farland was the only name proposed and
his nomination was made unanimous.
Farland, who is an ex-president of the
Typographical Union, was nominated by
O. G. Vickerson of the Waiters' Union
and seconded by J. X. Copus.
In addressing the convention, Farland
said that it was the first time that he had
ever appeared before a political body
and he appreciated the honor accorded
him by the convention. He felt that it
was an honor to go on a ticket headed by
Mayor Schmitz and if elected to office he
would devote all his energies to the wel

The only name presented for the office
was that of Frank Conklin, who Is en

was placed in nomination by E. J. Kervin

Harry A Knox of the same organization.

I say that for the governing body of the
Democratic party each delegation should select
its own members of the county cjmmittee.
(Applause.) Without any disrespect to Mr.
Hlckey as chairman â it would be immaterial
who might be chairman â what doss he know
about the particular needs of any one district
in the selection of county commltteemen at
large?. Does he know what we want in the
Thirty-fifth? Does he know what we want
in the Twenty-ninth? He knows what the
advisory committee of the organization wants,
what th* advisory committee, which ia com
posed of defeated candidates, wants. (Ap
plause.) He Is acting at the suggestion and
behest of a county committee which comes
here and Is ruled by men who went before the
voters In their respective districts wishing to
be delegates to this convention and were
CRITICIZES HICKEY.
On behalf of 40 per cent of the delegates
of this convention and 60 per cent of the
Democratic voters of this city and county I
now offer an amendment. This report places
in the bands of the chalrtnan of this-conven
tion the appointment of forty for the county
committee at large and only four to each dis
trict, giving him the same power that the
present county committee has; that is. In
any one district he can fill up by appointment
to overcome the selections of that district;
he can fill up In that district, if be wishes
to control, by appointing at large a sufficient
number and apportioning them to that particu
lar district.
Cook took the platform and his speech
against the adoption of the report was in
terrupted with applause and hoots. He
was fearless In his remarks, and although
he knew the votes were against his side,
he appealed to the delegates to strike out
the troublesome section. He spoke in
part as follows:
That the chairman appoint a committee of
five to act as the committee required by the
purity of elections law.
That no changes of votes be permitted dur
ing roll call.
That each candidate on being placed in nomi
nation pay to the secretary the sum of $10.

gation from each Assembly district and forty
appointed at large by the chairman of this

Tou know that the foundation stone of De
mocracy, the stone upon which that grand old
structure has been reared and upon which it
has .been maintained for the past century is
equal representation. I ask you if there is
any equality in the proposition presented by
the committee on order of business. I ask you
if the Democrats of the Thirty-sixth, Thirty
seventh, Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth. Fortieth
Forty-first, Forty-second' and Forty-third As
sembly Districts of this city will have any
representatives In that governing body if this
original motion shall prevail or the amend
ment shall not be carried. They will not be
heard in the councils of the party. I tell you
gentlemen, that you cannot dress the Demo
cratic party in kilts and have | It expose Its
bare legs to the ridicule of the people of San
Francisco. (Laughter and applause.) I tell
you that the people of my district will not
stand for any counterfeit Democracy. In the
chart of Democracy there is but one point of
the compass, and that point Is principle and
you must steer close to that principle- you
must give us representation; you must give us
equality. If this amendment shall not prevail
the Democratic party will be taken up and im
pounded as an estray. I cannot go back to
the Democrats In my district and say to them
that theyare denied representation in the coun
cils of the party. I say to you. gentlemen, who
are engaged in this work of putting up a Dem
ocratic ticket for the consideration of the voters
of this city that if you want the result cÂ£ -vur
DEMOCRACY'S FOUNDATION.
I suppose it will be useless for me prelimi
narily to tell you on which side of this question
I stand. I stand for the Democratic principle
that is represented by the amendment. For
the first time in my experience in Democratic
politics a minority of this convention Is repre
rented by compact district representatives
those who are here to speak for the Democrats
of the districts they represent.
Colonel Herbert Choynski seconded the
amendment and then . took the platform
and delivered a warm speech in favor of
the amendment and against the adoption
of the original report. In part he spoke
as follows:
cause of the manner in which It has been
conducted. I want to see a unification of this
party; I want to see a foundation laid for the
future. The people I am talking for are not
seeking for the positions or the Jobs. We are
fighting for a principle, so that we' may elect
a Democratic President of the United States.
That is a matter of national Importance. We
want to have from California a solid Demo
cratic delegation to the next National Demo
cratic Convention.
I move as an amendment to the report that
in the place and stead of the resolution drawn
and reported by- your committee the following
be Incorporated as an amendment: That the
new county committee, or sroverning body of
the Democratic party, be selected to consist
of 108 members, six from each Assembly dis
trict, to be chosen by the delegations to this
convention from each respective district, such
county commltteemen so selected to serve for
the ensuing two years until the next Demo
cratic Convention.
I believe that we are here to-night, \ not to
follow the dictates of Republican conventions,
or any Republican principles, but to have pure
and simple the doctrine of the Democratic
principle of representation from each particular
district, selected by each district, carried out.
I have also, with others, been styled In Jest
as belonging to the horse and cart brigade.
There Is one difference between -a horse and
one man who is trying to control the destlniea
of this convention, and that is a horse has no
gall bladder. (Laughter and applause.) .
I tell * you, this thing should be taken se
riously by you, and you should not allow
yourselves to be deceived on a proposition of
this kind. You should, assert your rights,
each and every one. of you; no matter from
what district you come, and demand that the
county committee be selected in a manner to
conform with the principles which ' the Demo
crats have always followed. I know of men
who are now affiliating with' the Republicans
who were -formerly stanch â¢Â¦ Democrats, but
have been driven away from our party be-
beaten. I say that after they have been
beaten are you going to lodge in their hands
the power to overcome the vote as cast by
the Democrats in the respective districts?
Are you going to allow, where there are eight
districts known to have been carried in op
position to the organization of the present
county committee, where more than 50 per
cent of the Democratic voters, of this city and
county have had tickets in the field and have
succeeded in electing in eight districts dale
gates to this convention, are you going to
allow the chairman, -for example, In the dis
trict I come from to select somebody to over
come the four that might be selected by us,
so that he can control that district? I say
that as we are Democrats, let us " stand by
Democratic principles. Let us have a rep
resentation from each one of the delegations.
I say a fair and Democratic way for the selec
tion of a county committee Is to have a com
mittee of 108 men, six from each Assembly
District, and let the delegates select them.
(Applause.) By doing so you have representa
tion, you have selected froni among? yourselves
men â¢whom you know, whom you can trust and
who can represent the Interests that you have
in your particular district, not men who know
nothing about your needs, who come in as
carpet-baggers. We don't want any carpet
baggers on the county committee. We want
every man on that committee to be able to
ppeak on behalf of the district that, he repre
sents, and we do not want Mr. Hlckey or any
other map as chairman to select t*em.
I have been charged with showing disre
spect to a gentleman who attempted to call
this convention to order. I have respect for
gray hairs, much more respect than those that
are nourished with Irish whisky and Scotch
whisky with a little dash of orange bitters in
it. (Applause, laughter and general uproar.)
I say, further, that It has been the policy of
some of the advisers of this so-called organi
zation of these defeated candidates to style me
ae an insurrecto. Well, I am an lnsurrecto
if to believe in Democratic principles is to
foist an insurrection upon this convention. :

Eugene F. Lacy, chairman of the com
mittee on order of business, submitted his
report and the evening's entertainment
commenced. William Hoff Cook, one of
the leaders of the "Horse and Carts,"
was the first speaker to attack the sec
tion of the report that stated how the
new County Committee ehould be ap
pointed.
-The report as submitted by Mr. Lacy
was as follows:

It "was 9 o'clock when Chairman Thomas
W. Hlckey called the convention to order.
He -was greeted -with cries from all parts
of the theater. "How about the switch.
Tommy," he was asked, but his only an
swer was to pound heavily on the sheet
of Iron with a heavy hammer. At the
outset of the evening Hlckey announced
the appointment of the following ser
geants at arms: John Kane, J. H. Ken
nedy, John Considlne, John B. Ford, Wil
liam Rledy, Joseph Tracey, Thomas Stan
ton and James L. Crooks.
The first order of business was the re
ception of the report of the committee on

man of the committee, took the platform
and read the following report, which was
adopted:

seek or desire it. I have not asked a member of your convention nor any one outside' thereof to aid
or further my nomination in the slightest. I have persistently arid consistently for months past refused to
say whether I would accept such nomination if it were tendered me. I would be personally grateful if you
were to unite upon some one other than myself, and I would support him with the same energy that I would
put into a personal canvass. If, however, it is your wish that I should lead you in this fight the only condi
tions that would tempt me to compliance are these:
(1) That the nomination shall come as the demand of a united party. I have never been a man of
faction and I am not willing to accept the leadership of any less than my whole party. I would go into this
fight, if at all, for no personal reasons, but out of a high sense of duty to my party and a still higher sense
of the obligation 1 am under to the people of this city who have so signally honored me at other times and
who have the right to call upon me for any service I can render. If we are to make this fight for better gov
ernment it must be made as a unit. I do not believe myself to be the one and only member of our party who
can make such a battle, but if others cannot be secured to lead you I will. If, however, you are not united I
beg that you find some one other than myself upon whom you can unite. This fight means more to the city
than the success of any man or of any faction or of any party.
(2) That eighteen men shall be named for Supervisors whose personal integrity and loyalty to the
city cannot be questioned.
(3) That if nominated for Mayor it is to be expressly understood that I shall make no promises of
patronage during the campaign. The prime test of a Mayor is the character of his appointees, and I must be
free in the event of election to make such appointments, within my party and the law, as commend them
selves by their superior fitness. Respectfully, . FRANKLIN K. LANE.
TO the Members of the Democratic Municipal Convention â Gentlemen: As I presume you will this
evening proceed to the nomination of a ticket I desire to say a few frank and direct words concerning
my position as to the nomination for Mayor. I have not sought that nomination and I do not now

WHO WERE MORE OR LESS IN EVIDENCE, SKETCHED BY A CALL ARTIST WHILE DOING THEIR
STUNTS AT LAST NIGHT'S SESSION OF THE BOURBONS. Â¦ , ' ' \
Lane was nominated for Mayor,
but the nomination vat not hailed with
any special demonstration of enthusiasm.
In fact, no motion was made to declare
the choice unanimous. There were two
candidates for the favor of the delegates.
Franklin K. Lane received 223% and
David I. Mabony 114% votes.
The adoption of the report giving the
chairman power to name forty members
at large of the new County Committee
was a signal triumph, for Gavin McNab.
The adroit leader of the Democratic
forces has eecured control of the works
for the great campaign of 1904. Another
triumph of the McNab forces was . the
adoption of the plank in the platform
which forbids any nominee of the conven
tion from accepting the nomination or go
ing on the ticket of any other political
party.
The so-called "Horse and Cart" dele
gates acted last night in a style that did
not reflect credit on their intelligence or
sense of propriety.
Chairman Hlckey seemed to be ani
mated by a desire to give the minority
fair play, but his efforts toward concil
iation were not appreciated. There are
indications that several district delega
tions are ready to bolt.
There was considerable talk last night,
after the adjournment of the convention
to the effect that Mr. Lane could not, un
der the present circumstances, accept the'
party leadership in this campaign.

Democratic municipal convention
was held last evening. Franklin K.

SHOWS SIGNS OF YIEUDING.
Turkey Seems Disposed to Avert War
"With Bulgaria.
LONDON, Sept. 23.-The Balkan situa
tion to-day presents a somewhat puzzling
aspect. Turkey is showing signs of yield
ing to the Bulgarian demands, and it is
evident from the dally meeting of the
Council of Ministers In the Yildlz Kiosk
that some sort of negotiations are In
progress, with the object of avoiding war.
According to a dispatch to the Daily
Mail from Constantinople, these counsels
concern two possibilitiesâ either to make
an arrangement satisfactory to the Mace
donians or to obtain from the great pow
ers promises of neutrality if it be found
impossible to avoid a war.
Apparently both Turkey and B'ulgaria
are anxious to repudiate having taken
the initiative In the negotiations.
The Sofia correspondent of the Dally
Telegraph asserts that overtures came
from Turkey and were welcomed by the
Bulgarian Minister, on the condition that
deeds were substituted for words and that
the cessation of wholesale massacres be
come an accomplished fact. The cor
respondent adds that a pacific solution,
if it comes, will emanate from Constant!,
nople, where the Bulgarian representative
is invested with full powers, and the ne
gotiations are said to be proceeding satis
factorily.
The same correspondent says that In
the meantime devastations by fire and
sword continue and the Bulgarian Gov
ernment has received from trustworthy
sources a grewsome tale of massacre,
tortures, Indignities and burnings, In
many Instances the victims being slowly
roasted alive. .
The assertion Is made In another Sofia
telegram that the Sultan will Issue an
lrade on Thursday granting the demand
for a mixed commission, but this state
ment Is not- confirmed and would seem
to be negatived by the dispatches from
Constantinople.
A Monastlr correspondent of the Dally
Chronicle, writing on September 15, says
the Bulgarian list of villages pillaged and
burned reaches a total of 104.
According to "a dispatch from Odessa,
the whole Russian Black Sea fleet is kept
on a war footing in readiness for any
eventuality.

able to secure the presence in court of

After the indictment of Erwln, Beavers
and Machen in Washington, D. C, was
announced, the statement was also made
that Richardson was on his way to the
Pacific Coast, and his arrival was eagerly
awaited, for many reasons. Richardson's
friends have claimed that he was In the
State of Washington and would arrive
In San Francisco at any time, but as the
days passed and Richardson did not ap
pear, his continued absence caused con
siderable comment.
Richardson was the leading: spirit of the
company that' sold its patented mail col
lection boxes to the Government and the
fact that his name appears as a witness
in the proceedings that led to the Indict
ment of Erwln and others, coupled with
the latest information that he will appear
at the trial of Beavers and Machen, is
looked upon as proof that in order to save
himself he has consented to tell air he
knows In connection with the frauds on

he spoke as follows:

Mayor and Supervisors to provide such rules
and reeulatljna a* will compel the employes
cf the city under civil service regulation to
abstain from offensive partisanship and attend
Ptrictly to their political duties as defined In
the charter of the city and county.

Whereas. Under the present assessed valua

nual revenue of $725,000 a year there has
been little money set aside for the purpose
of Improvements, but on the contrary addi
tional places for tax-esters have been made,
and salaries raised at the expense of moneys
which Fhouid have been levied for public
improvements, therefore be it
Resolved. That we denounce the course of
those public officials who have made It Im
j>ossible to set aside a substantial sura of
cauEe of their extravagant administrations and
the raising of salaries of their officials; and
we pledge the candidates nominated by the
Democratic convention to inaugurate a reform
by which high price salaries shall be lowered
and a substantial ?vÂ»n o f net lÂ»ss than $100,000
annually be set aside for public Improvements
In the city and county of San Francisco.
We denounce the actions of the Board of
Public Works and the Board of Health by
which the salaries cf favorite officials havÂ«
been Increased at the expense of taxes levied
by the Supervisors for public improvements.
The course of administration under the new
charter has resulted In a costly and extrava
gant government, largely caused by multiplica
tion of officials and the raising of salaries
Therefore the candidates for Mayor and Pu-
P*rvisonÂ» nominated by the Democratic party
Â«re hereby pledged to submit to the people of
San Francifco. an amendment to the
charter whereby It shall be pro
vided that out of every dollar of tax
ation levied for the expense of the municipal
administration 10 cents Â»hall be set aside for a
permanent annual fund- for public Improve.,
merits, which *hall not be devoted to the
salaries, nor to repairs of any kind, but shall
Xse devoted strictly to new construction or the
acquisition of new public Improvements for
the citv and county of San Francisco.
It gives ma great pleasure to second the
nomination of David 1. Mahoney. He is the
most available candidate in the Democratic
party. Two years ago, by a political accident,
the present Mayor. Eugene E. Schmitz,
was elected. Since his election he
has made a wonderful exhibition of
himself as a political gymnast. At
the I'nton League Club banquet tendered to
President Roosevelt he announced that he was
a Republican. Some months later he Journeyed
to New York and Rtnmped the State for a
Democratic candidate for Congress. This In
Itself was a marvelous performance. He now
stands under the shadow of a Republican
â¢Ttuef" and yet asks the support of the labor
people of this city and county. It seems that
our musical Mayor has been inharmonious.
The vote resulted as follows: Lane 223*Â£
Mahoney 114%.
No one moved to make Lane's nomina
tion unanimous. The delegates hurriedly
adjourned until next Thursday night
They will then meet in Union Square Hall
Frank G. Drury followed and nominated
David I. Mahoney. He praised his candi
date and told what a good citizen he had
been. He told of the splendid services
he had rendered to his party and what a
fit candidate he was for Mayor. Louis
Hirsch of the Forty-second District fol
lowed with a clever seconding speech. He
took occasion to criticize Mayor Schmitz
and gained a few laughs by his sallies.
He also praised Mahoney.
In part Hirsch spoke as follows:
I believe that every man In San Francisco
that voted for him a year ago will vote for
him again; and feeling; that the Integrity of
the charter and the future of the city hanu
on the election of the candidate nominated by
this convention. I give you the name of

plans that he haa made for his career. But
I know also that the Democratic party needs
him for a leader at this crisis In the fight for
the city. I know that he is too loyal to the
Democratic party, too loyal to the city to
hold back now when we demand his help
and guidance in the fight. I know that a
year ago. whÂ«-n the prospects wre dark Indeed

In public life, facing and meetlnR fearful odds;
I know? that he made a campalxn which shook

A serious clash between the Parks and
anti-Parks faction was narrowly averted
in the biiliard room of the Coates House,
Parks' headquarters, to-night. Delegate
Brophy, an anti-Parks man, was set upon
by a number of Parks' followers armed
with billiard cues and he was compelled
to hold his assailants at bay with a drawn
revolver until the police arrived. The
police department detailed a dozen of
ficers to preserve order at the hotel.
Kelly, who is one of the active oppo
nents of Sam Parks, the walking dele
gate, and John Henderson of St. Louis
were arrested last night. Both men are
delegates to the convention. They were
quarreling. Henderson, who is a- power
fully built man, struck Kelly and knocked
him down.
"I carried the revolver because I had
$187 In my pockets," explained Kelly. "I
had $187, for one reason, and for another
reason I was afraid of being slugged by
the Parks gang. I hacl.good reason to
fear that I would be assaulted."
"Are you In the habit of going armed
in NÂ«w York?" the City Attorney in
quired.
;'No, not in New York."
"Don't you know that Kansas City i3
a law-abiding town?" asked Judge Brady.
"Yes, but I was afraid of being slug
ged."
"Henderson, you are discharged; Kelly,
$15 for you," announced the Judge, who
also directed the court sergeant to retain
Kelly's revolver until he was about to
return to New York.
A. \i. Simpson, another one of the dele
sates to the convention, was arrested last
night. The officer who made the arrest
said Sampson had trouble in a saloon
and was preparing to throw stones
through the saloon windows when the
officers appeared. Sampson was fined $3
in the police court. Kelly, the New York
delegate who was fined $16, paid Samp
son's fine.

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23. 1903.
We are unalterably opposed to the acceptance by any
nominee of this convention of any nomination or indorse
ment from any other convention; and we pledge all nom
inees of this convention not to accept any nomination or
indorsement from any other convention, or to permit their
names to be placed upon the official ballot as the nominee
cf any party other thun the Democratic party.
Wo favor an amendment to the charter limiting and
circumscribing the power of all boards to appoint officers,
agents; clerks, superintendents, inspectors, engineers, sur
veyors, deputies and architects and fix their compensation.
I'nder the present charter provisions such power is un
limited, and therefore liable to abuse. We favor such an
amendment as will make the creation of any such of
fices and positions subject to the approval of the Mayor
and Hoard of Supervisors.
We regard franchises as property and are therefore
opposed to the granting of any franchise by this city to
any individual or corporation, except upon such terms and
conditions as will secure to the city a proper remunera
tion therefor.
We favor the strict enforcement of the civil service
provisions of the charter.
Rates for water and artificial lights should not be
fixed at any higher figure than will give to the companies
furnishing water and lights a fair return on a reasonable
valuation cf their property actually in use.
We condemn the action of the State Board of Equal
ization in imposing an enormous additional burden of
taxation upon our citizens as an arbitrary, unjust and in
defensible discrimination against this citv.
schools, modern sewer system, public playgrounds. Mis
sion Park, Twin Peaks Park, Telegraph Hill Park, St.
Mary's Square, County Jail, repavingr accepted streets,
public library and extending Golden Gate Park to the
Presidio. And in the event that said propositions, or any
of them, shall receive the sanction of the electors at the
comirg bond elections, we pledge each and all of the
nominees of thi3 convention, and particularly those hav
ing such matters directly in charge, to promptly and
faithfully carry out the will of the people as expressed
at said elections; and we further pledge our said nominees
to cause to be issued no more bonds for such purposes than
are actually necessary to comply with the people's will,
without either parsimony or extravagance; and we fur
ther pledge our nominees to use due care, vigilance, cir
cumspection and economy in the expenditure of the
moneys derived from such bond issues.
We believe that with the present large and increasing
valuation of property in the city subject to taxation it
will be possible to set apart from the revenues of the
city, and within the dollar limit of taxation, a substantial
amount of money "for permanent Improvements; and we
pledge our Board of Supervisors and the members there
of to set apart for that purpose as large an amount of
such revenue as is consistent with the proper adminis
tration of municipal affairs.
We believe that the acquisition of an abundant sup
ply of pure water for the city, under municipal owner
ship, control and operation, is a matter of extreme neces
sity. ' The large and continued Increase in the population
in our city and the increased consumption of water
causal thereby and the constant and alarming decrease In
quantity and deterioration in quality of the present supply
make It Imperative that an abundance of pure and whole
some water shell be obtained from some other source.
Such supplies are available and our Supervisors have al
ready taken steps to secure them for this city. Regard
for the public health requires that this work shall pro
ce*Â»d without delay. We therefore pledge our Board o*
Supervisors; and the members thereof, to submit to the
people a proposition to issue bonds for such purpose at
the earliest practicable moment and to take all other
steps necesFary to meet this great public emergency.
We favor the abolition' of cobblestone pavements upon
the business streets of this city and on other streets
where such pavements are objectionable; and we pledge
our nominees to remove such pavements as soon as prac
ticable ar.d replace the same with smoother, cleaner and
more sanitary pavements.
We pledge our nominees to icfuse to grant any fran
chise for surface steam roads through the Mission dis
trict ar.d to use their utmost efforts to have the present
tracUs in the Mission removed.
The Democratic party has ever been in the forefront
in advocating the acquisition of public utilities by the
city and in proposing measures for Its permanent im
provement and beautiflcation. Therefore we unequivocally
indorse the pending proposition for the issuance of bonds
to acquire, reconstruct and operate the Geary-streei Rail
road, and we also favor all other pending propositions
to Issue bonds, including the new county hospital new
We condemn the present administration of the County
Clerks office as scandalous in the extreme, and hold the
Republican party responsible therefor. In this office
scandals have become of such frequent occurrence ae to
excite little public comment. AVe pledge our nominee for
County Clerk to so conduct the affairs of his office and
to exercise such care in the selection of his office force
that the work, which is now so far behind as to consti
tute a great menace to the rights of litigants, will be
promptly and efficiently performed.

WE. the duly elected delegates representing; the

San Francisco, do hereby. In municipal conven
tion assembled, adopt the following as its
Platform nnd declaration of principles:
Vi'e take great satisfaction in directing the attention and
scrutiny of the people to the records of the Democratic
officials of this city end county". Their records are con
clusive evidence of pledges faithfully kept and a guaran
ty of faithful and honest service in the future. The Dem
ocratic tr.otnbcrs of the Board of Supervisors have f ul Â¦'
filled every rie<5ge required of them and have given the
city an administration which reflects signal credit upon
them and their pnrty. The administration cf the office
Â°f City Attorney has been safe, honest and conservative,
and the important interests of the city entrusted to that
official have be^n guarded with an ability and zeal which
cannot be tco strongly commended. The operation of the
charter has been made successful largely through his in
telligent, able nnd painstaking interpretation of its pro
visions. Our Assessor has equalized the burden of tax
ation in a most Jvrt and impartial manner. Over $22 003 000
reducticn in assessments has been made by him on the
property of small taxpayers, which had previously been
cverasseswd: while on the other hand the revenue of tne
city has been increased by the sum of half a million dol-
Jars usually, derived largely from property which had
previously escaped all taxation. Our public service cor
porations have, for the nrst time In the history of the
2& er ! a " C6S * d on th * "me basis of valuation as the
Individual taxpayer. The Incumbents of the offices of
Reorder. Coroner. District Attorney jLnd Police Judges
rave performed the duties of their respective positions
with commendable ability and with fidelity to their party
arid the people. Therefore we besp*ak the confidence of
the people in the nominees of this convention and claim
thet the record of our party in the past should be an
earriei-t of e^ual fidelity In the future.
. The record of the present administration of the May
ore office, on the contrary, has been such as to forfe'lt
ail claim to pubHc confidence; for appointees of the present
Mayor have been cpenly charged with corruption in of
fice, ar.d evidence has been brought forward to sustain
the charges, which hav* never been refuted. We charge
tne Mayor with willful violation of the charter in ap
pointing three or more Republicans as members of the
Board of Police Commissioners, in defiance of the char

THE EMPORIUM.
THE EMPORIUM.
THE EMPORIUM.An American who occupied the distinguished if
obscure position of Consul in a town in the United
States of Colombia has resigned his position and re
turned to his home in Oregon. : The remaining mem
bers of our consular, service in the southern republic
are still resigned in spirit if not in action.
While the Postofnce Department is engaged in the
ungrateful task of cleaning its own .nest of the foul
growths that have crept to an existence with it, de
partment officials should not forget that they have the
reputation, well won, of being inplacable, pursuers of
evildoers and that punishment has inevitably fol
lowed the commission of crimes against the postal
service.
College students the world over have been per
mitted a freedom, a liberation from restraint, a frank
for frolics and follies granted to no other com
munity of rational beings. They are allowed to
frame their own laws within broad limitations and in
a belief that their sense of right will protect them
and those with whom they come in contact. But
the Berkeley boy who carried vitriol into a crowd
and wreaked a dastardly crime upon one of his fellows
ought to preserve the memory of his action as a
blight upon his own life.
MANY are the arguments. with which the op
timist of our time has met the pretensions of
those who sigh for "the good old days" and
assert that our social and economic conditions are
worse than they were forty years ago, but rarely has
the refutation of the lament been more effectively
made than by Chauncey Depew in a recent address
on the changes that have occurred in the relations of
labor and capital during his lifetime. The facts cited
strikingly attest the steady advance of labor and the
diminution in the percentage of profits obtained by
the owners of invested capital.
Speaking of matters within his own experience and
knowledge Senator Depew said: "In 1866, when I
began as an attorney with the railroad, the average
pay per capita, including all classes on the pay roll,
was less than $400 a year; in 1880 it was $520. In
1903 it was $633 per annum, an advance of over 20
per cent since 1880 and 58 per cent since 1866. In
1880 capital received 8 per cent upon its investment
in New York Central stock and 7 per cent upon its
investments in the bonds. In 1903 the stockholder
gets 5 and the bondholder 3}4 per cent. Of the earn
ings in the year ending June 3, 1902, capital received
$6,000,000 from the stock and $20,600,000 from the
bonds, or $26,600,000 in the aggregate, while labor
received $29,093,400."
Forty years is not much in the life of a nation, but
THEN AND NOW.
The Moors have emphatically announced their in
tention to expel all foreigners from Morocco. One
is forced to wonder what character of conditions
may exist in this land, physically and otherwise unfit,
that any rational being would wait to be forced to
leave it.
BY the cutting of the telephone wires at the
City Hall on Monday afternoon the evil re
sults of that form of crime have been brought
close home to the people of San Francisco. An im
mediate consequence of the act was a long delay in
obtaining assistance from the Central Emergency
Hospital for a woman suddenly stricken with a se
vere hemorrhage. Fortunately relief was obtained
after a long time by telephoning through the private
line of the police office. Had that line also been cut
the criminal would have been directly responsible for
the death of a woman who had done him no harm
and against whom he could not have had even in the
malice of such a mind as his any grudge whatever.
Crimes of this kind arc now becoming alarmingly
frequent. To a very large extent our social organ
ism is dependent for its orderly working upon the
service of the telephone. The wires are made use
of for calls of all kinds, and people rely upon them
in every emergency that requires the prompt sum
moning of the poiice, of hospitals or of medical aid.
A cessation of the operation of the wires therefore
entails danger to life in many instances, while inflict
ing in every instance a gross degree of inconvenience
upon both the business and the social life of the com
munity. The maintenance of the telephone service
in an unimpaired efficiency is therefore a matter of
prime necessity to the community, and accordingly
severe and summary punishment should be provided
for all criminals who may be convicted of the offense
of cutting the wiÂ«-es or in any other way interfering
with their operation.
Along with the advance of civilization there has
been provided for the criminal a number of new
methods of attacking society, and he has been
prompt to take advantage of them. The invention
of dynamite and other powerful explosives had no
fooner been made known to the general public than
the criminal made use of them with a reckless ma
lignity that v.-as startling. Plans were laid for blow
ing up steamers at sea, for wrecking tunnels while
trains laden with passengers were passing through
them, and for destroying buildings crowded with
people. So, too, the discoveries of the terrible ef
fects of vitriol opened a way for the perpetration of
some of the most malignant atrocities known to the
records of crirrif. Thus the criminal has watched the
progress of civilization only to see in what way he
could increase his ability to kill or to torture with
impunity, being utterly careless who his victims
ought be. /
Thr dependence of a community upon telephones
has put in the way of these malicious criminals a
new means of injuring society. By the comparatively
easy feat of cutting an important wire it is possible
for a malicious man to expose many thousands to
inconvenience and some to death itself, as happened
in the case of the woman stricken with hemorrhage
on Monday afternoon. The criminal has also the
delight of meditating upon the fact that if a fire were
* to break out while the wires are cut there might be
a further damage done to the city and possibly a
good many lives might be lost as well as a great deal
of property destro3*ed. j
The criminals who commit offenses of this kind are
strictly of a malignant temper. They desire to work
evil for its own sake. It is quite possible that the
first thought of the criminal may be that of injuring
the telephone company, but if he possess a particle
of intelligence he soon perceives that the cutting of
the wires of the company injures the company less
than the public. To the really malignant mind, how
ever, it does not matter much who is injured so long
as some one is injured. Hence when once the idea
of interrupting the telephone service by cutting the
wires is thought of as a feasible project, the crimi
nal carries it out reckless of the consequences.
Confronted by a species of crime that makes use
of the appliances of civilization to inflict harm with
a malicious recklessness, society must set itself reso
lutely to the task of crushing out the evil by pur
suing the perpetrators with the utmost energy of the
law. In this case the telephone company has offered
a reward of $5000 for the arrest of the guilty party.
The action is commendable, though no such in
ducement should be necessary to rouse both the
police and the public to the task of detecting the
perpetrator and bringing him to justice. It is to be
borne in mind that no person is safe against such
a criminal as this, for his malice runs at large against
the community as a whole. He who has cut tele
phone wires will not need much in the way of an
impulse to set him to cutting the fire alarm wires,
or even to starting incendiary fires. Society, in fact,
has a dangerous type of malignant to deal with,
and should see to it that his career is short
MISSION TO ABYSSINIA
PROVOKES MUCH COMMENT
German Newspapers Declare It Is
Fresh Indication of American
Ambition Abroad. "
BERLIN, Sept. 22.â The mission of Mr.
Skinner, the United States Consul Gen
eral at Marseilles, to King Menellk of
Abyssinia, is the subject of lively com
ment here. Not one of the newspapers
professes to understand what it means,
but most of them aver that it is a "fresh
indication of the United States' ambition
abroad."
Several papers while animadverting to
the "imperialistic mood" of the United
States regard it as natural that she
should reach out for new spheres of
influence.

WIRE-CUTTING FIENDS.
GUATEMALA has suffered so much from the
lack of a sound currency and a stable mone
tary system that her Government has under
taken the rash experiment of trying to raise the rate
of wages of plantation laborers by statute, with the
avowed object of saving them in that way from the
wrong done by paying them in depreciated and still
further depreciating paper money.
Of old it was not unusual for governments to un
dertake to fix the rate of wages and the prices of
food by statute, but of recent years the governments
of civilized men have understood the folly of such
attempts, consequently the announcement that the
President of Guatemala has undertaken to revive
the old experiment and to fix wages by govern
mental dictation comes as something of a surprise
even to those who are most accustomed to the va
garies of politics in Latin America.
A defense of the action of the President has been
recently published by way of reply to the many com
plaints made by the planters of interference with the
labor market. So- far as the defense consists of a
statement of facts it seems to be valid, for there,
can be no question that the instability of the
currency and the steady decline in the purchasing
power of money has been a serious injury to the
workingmen of the country. That sort of thing al
ways happens wherever an unsound and vicious
monetary system prevails. It would have happened
in the United States had either the greenback move
ment or the free silver crusade been successful. It is
therefore worth while for the American people to
give some little heed to what is happening now to
the plantation workers of Guatemala.
In the course of his defense the advocate of the
action of the Government says: "The difference in
the value of paper money and of gold and silver has
so altered the relation of prices to things that not
only foreign goods, which are paid for in gold, but
domestic articles of food and other necessities of life
have risen in value in proportion to the depreciation
of paper money of the country. And it is not strange
that the price of native products should be affected
by this condition of the monetary system when it
is seen that the producers must receive for them in
gold what they have to pay for goods which they
need and do not produce."
For the purpose of protecting the workers of the
plantations against the evils resulting from a system
in which the worker is paid in paper but has to buy
in gold the President decrees that the wages of plan
tation hands shall be $i 50 a day, an amount which
at the present value of Guatemala paper money is
equivalent to about ten cents in gold. It is cer
tainly nothing extraordinary in the way of high
wages, and if the decree were based on anything like
a rational foundation it would not be objection
able. Ample experience, however, has proven that
a government cannot fix the rate, of wages, nor can
it keep an irredeemable paper currency at any kind
of a fixed value. The decreed $i 50, which is worth
ten cents in gold to-day and serves the plantation
worker as a means of obtaining the low subsistence
fhat prevails among the Indians of that country, may
be worth only five cents within a year. The only way
in which the Government of Guatemala can effec
tively serve the interests of its people in this respect
is that which has been adopted by Mexico. Let the
currency be put upon a sound basis and labor will
have no need for governmental regulation of wages.
An interesting side light on the situation is thrown
by a report from Guatemala that "the property
owners say they do not object to a payment of the
wages fixed by the Government, for that within itself
is a small matter, but that the law will so operate as
to increase the already large amounts they have to
pay to certain Government officials for their favors."
Perhaps the President and his Ministers may have
had an idea of that effect of the law when they pro
mulgated it. .
GUATEMALA'S EXPERIMENT.
The traffic maintained by white men in Chinese
coolies in this city has already resulted in scandal to
the Federal Government and dishonor and death to
some of those who were pals in the dishonest trade.
Time after time such scandals as these have affronted
the public like the recurrent symptoms of intermit
tent fever, and as long as the palms of Federal un
derlings itch for dishonest money scandal and ex
posure will inevitably follow.

Irene Goulding and Ivy Pollard occupied
important roles, which they filled in the
most creditable manner. Both are splen
did singers and both sing solos in this
opera. Four other little damsels of the
pinafore age who go nameless as
etceteras on the programme made a hit
with a witch song. They were attired in
appropriate costumes and, as many young
ladles remarked audibly, "looked too cute
for anything." The rest of the stellar" ag
gregation contributed generously one and
all to the luster of the finished produc
tion.
"Dorothy" will be presented for the sec
ond and last time to-night.
That popular "Infant phenomenon"
Daphne did a great deal of the heavy
work. In addition to rendering a long
speaking part she did a song and dance
turn which brought down the house. Fred
Pollard sang "My Pauline" until he was
nearly exhausted and then his hearers
wanted some more of it. Alice Pollard
had rather less than usual to do, but tho
audience was afforded an opportunity to
enjoy the music of her voice a few times
nevertheless.
The opera is rich in pleasing music and
contains something of humor. The part
of it all which pleases the audience most
of course is tho cleverness with which the
little tots play the parts intended for
artists of maturer years. A couple of
topical songs are introduced to give thÂ«
performance a trifle more life than It
would have otherwise.
Daphne and Fred Pollard carried off
most of the honors at the Grand Opera
house last night. It was the first time
that the diminutive theatrical stars have
presented the musical comedy "Dorothy"
in this city and the large audience which
came to hear and witness went away
more than pleased. The applause came
frequently and generally with the em
phasis that indicates genuine apprecia
tion.
With all this the large audience de
manded more. The string quintett had
to repeat a waltz; Mrs. Birmingham was
urged for additional songs and complied.
The most effective, if not the most am
bitious number for the chorus, was the
"Break, Break," when the chorus had the
combined assistance of the strings, wood,
wind, brass, piano and organ.
Of the chorus it may be said that it is
as well balanced as ever in the history
of the club. It is sure in attack, under
excellent control, certain in tone, sym
pathetic. Only once during the evening
did the singers stray from the fold of
tempo; never did they commit the cardin
al sin of singing out of tune. The only
real trouble with the concert was that
there was not more of it. The opening
of the season was an unqualified success.
A musical audience completely filled the
hall on invitation.
To sum up. the following compositions
were given in addition to the "Bridal
Voyage"â March and .waltz for the
strings, by Volkman; "The Long Day
Closes," by Arthur fc. Sullivan: "Break.
Break," by John Hyatt Brewer; ballads
by Delibes, Reynalde Hahn and Clarence
Lucasâ these three being sung by Mrs.
Birmingham;, a folk song by J. B. Zer
lett; a roundelay, by Rheinberger; two
songs, respectively by Nevin and Victor
Harris, which were sung by Mrs. Birm
ingham, and the final waltz song by
Vogel.
The twenty-seventh season of the Lor-
Ing Club was opened auspiciously last
evening with a concert in Native Sons'
Hall. In no respect has the club ever
given a concert more replete with solid
enjoyment or artistic merit. Assistance
was given by Mrs. Birmingham; by B.
Jaulus, F. Forde and "William von der
Mehden, violinists; by J. Lewis, vio
la; F. Bracamonte, cello; S. Brown, bass;
P. C. Zeh, flute; G. Schneider and William
Klein, clarinets, and A. L.. Tillman and O.
Schlott, horns. Miss Ruth Lorln was at
the piano, and right clever she was; and
J. C. Fyfe was at the organ. With this
aggregation of talent, under the able di
rection of David W. Loring, much was
naturally expected. The outcome fully
Justified optimism.
The programme ranged from a virile
composition by H. liofman, "Hareld's
Bridal Voyage," in which Herbert K
Medley was the well selected soloist, to
a final waltz song, with much interven
ing.
Agostino, as Alfredo, threw his very
eouI into the number In which Verdi's
genius appears to have been concentrated.
His top notes were given with a power
that fairly thrilled his hearers and many
were the bravos that resounded through
out the house at the conclusion of his
singing.
Gregorettl's magnificent barytone was
more than equal to the exacting vocal re
quirements of the part of Germont and
his scene with Violetta, in which he begs
her to renounce her son, was given In
forceful manner, both from a vocal and
dramatic point of view. The concerted
singing of the principals, assisted by
Slgnora Napoleoni, Gullio, Cortesl. Quinto

LOVERS of grand opera were given

JUDGED by the reports, the recent irrigation
convention was the largest that has been held
since the national organization was made twelve
years ago. That it was the most useful may also be
true, though its usefulness may have to be measured
more by what it refused to do than what it did.
There appears to have been a desire to bring the
meeting out of the air and into the waters of irri
gation, which, however, only partially succeeded.
The practical irrigators, and those who expect to be,
desired to use the occasion for educational purposes.
Under the Federal irrigation law the Government
will spend many millions of dollars in water works.
The users of this water must return the money to the
Government, either in the price they will pay for
their land or in the rent they will pay for water. In
either case it will be no gift, and those who pay it
cannot afford the time required to learn the capacity
of their land and the proper application of water by
experiment.
The duty of water in irrigation varies with the ab
sorbent quality of the soil, the rate of evaporation
and the kind of crop to which it is applied. It is
known that too much water, or water applied at the
wrong time, destroys the fertility of some soils,
which under proper and timely irrigation are fertile
and profitable. The Agricultural Department has a
corps of experienced scientific men working on these
physical problems and identifying the different kinds
of soil with the water service each requires for profit
able tillage, and in like manner establishing the
measure of irrigation required by the staple crops.
These useful investigators and the Government en
gineers engaged in the engineering problems were
present in Ogdcn and on the programme with papers
filled with information which practical men desired
to hear. But there were also on the programme a
few professional orators, who deal in words of the
imagination and irrigate with wind, and when these
got into action they so occupied the time of the con
vention that the modest men of science were crowded
out entirely, as appears by the reports, and had to
be content with leave to print their papers.
The atmospheric irrigators seem likely to do the
cause much injury by their habit of raising expecta
tions impossible of realization. For illustration, we
note that they persistently refer to irrigation as ap
plicable "to an empire of land in the arid States des
tined to be the home of eighty millions of people."
Indeed, one left enumeration entirely behind him,
and, giving notice that his imagination was "stag
gered" by the prospect, proceeded to immediately
settle "'countless millions" in the same area.
All of these perfervid social builders put the' total
acreage that can be touched by water and made hab
itable, when the Federal irrigation law has finished
its work and put the last available drop of water
upon the last available inch of land, at 100,000,000
acres. The law under which this land is to be irri
gated permits a maximum to each settler of 160
acres and no more. Each one will have his maxi
mum, for most of the land lies on the high plateaus,
where the variety of crops is limited by the short
season, and a quarter section is little enough to keep
a family. So when the whole hundred million acres
is watered, sold and occupied, its 625,000 quarter sec
tions, with a family on each with the'average of five
to a family, will support just 3,125,000 people, or less
than the population of Illinois.
Of course that addition to the rural population of
the West is highly important and much to be desired,
but it is a long way this side of the countless millions
which teem in the mouths of the imaginative para
sites who infest irrigation congresses. This imagina
tive quality seems to have slopped over into the
resolutions adopted by ' the congress, which in the
most lush and sumptuous manner suggest that the ir
rigation of a hundred million acres on our cold
plateaus will plant there the results achieved in the
Valley of the Po, the Indus and the Nile. Yes, this
will happen when irrigation raises bananas in the
open air at Cape Nome.
The address of the Secretary of Agriculture was of
the highest value, amounting to a text book on prac
tical irrigation, and those who appreciated it re
gretted that they were not permitted to hear the
papers prepared by his fine corps of scientists who
were present. The usual scrippers' raid was made
on the convention to get all land laws repealed by
which the public domain may pass into private
ownership, except by the location of land scrip, of
which about 6,000.000 acres is held by corporations
and syndicates. The repeal of the desert land,
homestead and timber and stone acts leaves scrip
location the only possible means of acquiring public
lands, snd every settler that wants land must pay
whatever price the scrippcr asks and then take all the
risks of location. It was a pretty scheme, but was
too raw, and the convention attacked it with a war
whoop and smote it into a dry and dusty death.
Other parts of the platform are open to criticism,
for they seek to identify irrigation with an attack
upon the fundamental principles of government, but
perhaps they will stand as good examples to the next
convention of what to avoid.

though the symphony was gracefully
enough given, its rendering lacked the es
sential purity of line and tone. It lacked
also the spontaneous quality and some
thing of warmth and color. The finale
perhaps went most successfully, the men
by then beginning to waken to their task.
But the symphony was among the least
successful efforts of the season, as It is
among the most essentially difficult
things attempted.
Yesterday afternoon saw the introduc
tion of an innovation in the shape of a
soloist. Mr. Otto Spamer, who made quite
a furor by his playing of the Allegro

has not yet shown any particular distinc
tion or unusual magnetism.
The afternoon was prolific of novelties,
chief of them the Strauss Serenade for
thirteen Instruments. The number was
productive of much interest, it being the
first orchestral work of Richard Strauss
to bo Riven here. Those to whom the
later Strauss gives large cause of offense
in this early product of his penâ It is
Op. 7â professed to find much hope for
the composer's future. Certainly it has
none of thÂ« complexities of build - and
harshness of discords so freely ascribed
to the later work. The Influence of thÂ©
older schools, as also that of Wagner,
are Quite apparent in the "Serenade," as
well as a peculiar piquancy that prom
ises what the later Strauss has become.
To me the work is on first hearing rather
curious than beautiful; Its scoringâ
Strauss has taken the small orchestra
and simply eliminated all the strings but
one double bass â productive of problem
atic charm, its ' melody without Imme
diate spell, its harmonies generally con
ventionally effective. But there is, too,
the aforementioned characteristic flavor,
and It Is quite possible the "Serenade" of
longer acaualntanco would find the ar
dent championship it has aroused where
it is among the well known works. Mas
senet's "La VierRe." announced as a nov
elty, was very well given here at the
Campanarl symphony concert In the
spring, and yesterday was also charm
ingly rendered under Mr. Scheel's baton.
Thoroughly enjoyable was the Lustspiel
overture by E. N. Reznlcek. that closeU
the programme. It is a delightful com
position, picturesaue in theme and treat
ment, full of humor and mirth. It was
handsomely played. This, with the Bee

the afternoon, completed the programme.
The attendance was again encouragingly

JAMES NEILJj, one of the most
popular actors that has ever ap
peared in this city, will begin a
brief engagement at the Grand
Opera-house next Sunday matinee
in the romantic melodrama, "A Gentle
man of France," a dramatization of
Stanley Weyman's novel by Harriet Ford,
which proved an immense success in the
East and which is described as a play of
action arid . adventure.
Mr. Neill's role is that of Gaston de
Marsac, whose adventures suggest the ex
citing scenes in which Dumas' hero
D'Artagnan participated. The great fea
ture of it is his single-handed combat with
seven lusty adversaries on a great stair
case. This scene proved a veritable sen
sation not only in New York, but in
Philadelphia and Boston as well. It car
ries the action to a sensational pitch and
is said to have scored from fifteen to
twenty curtain calls nightly, even on
blase Broadway.
The play opens with Gaston de Marsac
suing at the court of Henry of Navarre.
Hero the hero Is flattered and ridiculed,
but he wins the regard of Mile, de la Vlre,
the haughty court beauty, who gives him
a rose. In the next scene Navarre and
Baron Rosny V come to llarsac's poor
apartments to offer him the dangerous
mission of rescuing Mile, de la Vire from
the castle of Chlze, whither Turenne,
Navarre's rival in the favor of the
Huguenots, has contrived to banish her.
De Marsac accepts the mission and
makes the rescue. In the fourth scene
Fresnoy asserts that De Marsac boasted
of Mile, de la Vlre's favor and convinces
her that he, and not De Marsac, was
deputed by Navarre to rescue her. In
the end De Marsac accomplishes the pur
pose of Navarre, who by the death of
Henry III Is now King of France. The
new leader loads him with riches and
honors, and Mile, de la "Vlre, whose im
perious love has been won against heavy
odds, gives him her heart and hand.

For a continuance of this steady progress in the
right direction there needs nothing more than a
maintenance of harmony between the two great ele
ments of the ' industrial world. As Senator Depew
puts it: "The forces of capital and of labor have in
the last year progressed in organization and in power
beyond any previous twenty. As warring factions
they are destructive of the comforts, of the peace and
almost of the life of communities and of the country.
They ought to dwell together in harmony and live
under a perfect understanding or with methods by
which disputes can be speedily settled before all out
side interests are involved."
it is a long time in the lif<of an individual, and con
sequently the changes Recorded by Mr. Depew ap
pear to have taken place slowly, and yet they have
been almost rapid enough to amount to something
like a revolution. The investor who formerly ob
tained 8 per cent on his capital now obtains only z l /%.
During the same period the rate of average wages in
creased upward of 20 per cent. The figures of course
relate only to a single railroad, but they may be taken
as fairly representative, of the proportions of wages
and profits now obtained by labor and by capital in
all the great American industries.

Twelve Men Selected to Adjudicate
JURY WILL DETERMINE
MERITS OF DUFFY'S SUIT
Ethel Ross, the little heiress, Is just 15
years old and unusually pretty. The fam
ily was preparing to move to 312 Elizabeth
street when they heard the joyful tid
ings. They did not expect to hear from
the case for several months yet and were
pleasantly surprised at the information
that the fortune had at last come to the
child. She has Just finished a course at
the James Lick Grammar School. She Is
very fond of music and states that she
will now cultivate her taste in that di
rection. â¢
The opinion is written by Justice Lori
gan, with whom Justices Henshaw and
McFarland concur. The property belong
ing to the estate of Robs Is on Third
street, between Market and Mission, and
on the lower part of Eddy street.
The two daughters of Joseph Ross Sr.
argued that the granddaughter had ap
peared in the matter at too late a date.
The Supreme Court agrees with the lower
tribunal that it is not justice to apply
too strlngest rules In cases like the one
at bar and that a mere technicality
should not deprive the little girl of her
fortune. John, the second son, is not af
fected by the decision, but otherwise Jo
seph Ross might just an well have died
Intestate according to the decision of the
court.
The court holds that the will of the
elder Ross has no bearing on the case of
the minor litigant. The capitalist sup
posed that his son was still living and did
not know that he had been married. He
knew nothing of the existence of his
granddaughter and erred In not recogniz
ing the possibility that his son might
have an heir. The court holds that the
little girl had a claim on the estate and
the fact that her deceased father had
been bequeathed $10 was of no Import
from a legal standpoint.
Mrs. Jansen and her daughter never
had any idea that they were entitled to
any part of the rich estate until some one
told the mother that the little girl had
a claim to a fortune. Two months after
the Issuance of the decree of distribution
a petition in behalf of Ethel Ross was
filed at the County Clerk's office request
ing that the previous order be annulled.
The court granted the petition In spite
of the protests of the executors of the
estate and the beneficiaries of the will and
when the case had been heard declared
that the child was the rightful owner of
one-third of the property left by Joseph
Ross, the father. An appeal was taken
to the Supreme Court by the- litigants.
Meanwhile the Jansens and the little
girl continued to live in straitened cir
cumstances, but hopeful of some, 1 time
coming into possession of the property in
litigation. The case has been before the
Supreme Court for about two years.
CHILD'S CLAIM IS LEGAL.
Finally the mother had herself declared
a widow by the courts and subsequently
was quietly wedded to Carl Jansen. She
kept the little girl with her always. Jo
seph Ross passed out of this life October
22, 1808. On March 12 of the same year
he had made a will In which he devised
his fortune to his daughters. He pro
vided that his sons, Joseph and John,
ehould each received $10 and expressly
elated that they should get nothing more.
The will was offered for probate by the
executors and the court issued a decree of
distribution on October 20, 1899.
MOTHER MARRIES AGAIN.
Little Ethel Ross of 1123 Sanchez street
did not have a penny she could call her
own yesterday morning. Yesterday after
noon the Supreme Court declared she was
the rightful owner of San Francisco real
estate worth more than $50,000. Her
mother is married to Carl Jansen, who
has been struggling hard for several
years to make a living in the city's
tailoring shops. The family will soon be
placed in a position of affluence. Tester
day they were wild with joy when they
learned of the decision of the Justices of
the State's highest tribunal.
It all happentd through a mistake on
the part of Joseph Ross, who died in this
city five years ago. Deceased was pos
sessed of a fortune worth a trifle more
than 5150,000. He had tw.o sons and two
daughters. He became tptranged from
the boys and cut them off with a pittance.
Ross, however, did not know that one of
them had been married and had a daugh
ter. On that account the little, dark-eyed
girl is an heiress.
Joseph came to San Francisco a poor
man many decades ago. By dint of hard
work and an occasional bit of good for
tune he became the possessor of much
valuable real estate in the heart of the
city. His sons, Joseph and John, disap
pointed him and he set them adrift. â¢
Joseph married the present Mrs. Jan-
Ben in 1887. A year later he went to the
State of Washington for his health. For
eight months he wrote frequent endearing
letters to his wife and then he was lost
eight of. Diligent inquiry on the part of
the wife failed to reveal anything in re
gard to his fate'and after several years
he was given up for dead. The little girl,
Ethel, was born shortly after his depar
ture for the north.
Judge Kerrigan annulled the marriage
of Ada Johnson to John R. Melburn. She
complained that after she became his wife
she learned that he had a wife in Swe
den from whom he had never been di
vorced. Divorces were granted to Augus
ta Miller from John D. Miller for deser
tion, Lucy A. TUli from Carlo Tilll for
desertion and Richard F. Dawson from
Elizabeth Dawson for infidelity.
Mrs. McNeil charges in her complaint
that McNeil, on the very day of their
marriage, March 17 of this year, gave her
a cruel beating. He used his fists and
his feet, she says, and cursed her between
blows and kicks. This performance, she
says, was repeated on May 24 and again
on June 7. On June 13, she says, he again
beat her in a most brutal manner, wind-
Ing up the affray by firing two 6hots at
her.
Though Annie McNeil has been a wife
for less than half a year, she is already
of the opinion that she prefers a life of
single blessedness to that of a matron.
In accordance with this belief she filed a
suit for divorce against George McNeil.
She charges him with cruelty and says
that from a few hours after the wedding
up to a few days ago he treated her in
humanly. She says that he has been so
brutal to her that a few days ago she
came to the conclusion that if she contin
ued to live with him her life would be
endangered, and left him.
PBEFEBS SINGLE LIFE.
In a cross complaint filed by Peter
Mitchell in the divorce proceedings
brought by Therese j Mitchell he accuses
her of being a cruel wife. He says also
that she is an unfaithful one and 'addicted
to the excessive use of intoxicants. He
charges that because of her love * for
liquor she has neglected her 15-months-old
child and has so managed or neglected to
manage her household that he has had to
very frequently prepare his own meals
and do the family washing.
A suit for divorce on the ground of fail
ure to provide was filed by Anne A.
Northrop against Melton Northrop.
An amended complaint for divorce was
filed by Amber Wllkerson, leading lady at
Fischer's Theater, against Ira Puerl Wil
kerson. The amendment consists of tech
nical changes in the original complaint
and was filed with the consent of the de
fendant.
Frieda Magee, who on October 12, 1901,
was married to Roger D. Magee Jr., the
son of Rodger D. Magee, is seeking a di
vorce on the ground of extreme cruelty.
In her complaint she alleges that two
months after she became Mrs. Magee her
husband cruelly beat her and that in the
months of January, March and October of
last year he did likewise. He also chas
tised her in a most strenuous manner, she
says, at least once during every month
from October, 1902, to August of this
year, when she left him. She says that
three times during their married life she
grew tired of her husband's alleged brutal
ity and left him, returning to him on two
occasions on the strength of his promise
to treat her decently. When she became
Mrs. Magee she was a Miss Schnibbe.
She was only 18 years of age and her hus
band was 22.
Josephine MacDonald, who is being
sued for divorce on the ground of cruelty,
answered her husband's complaint yester
day with a general denial of all his
charges, except that In which he accuses
her of filing an affidavit with the of
ficers of Hesperian Parlor, Native Sons
of the Golden West, in which she charged
her husband with being a drunkard and
a loafer and an associate of the lowest of
the low. She admits the truth of this
charge. With her answer Mrs. MacDon
ald filed a petition for alimony pending
the suit. She says she is penniless, lack
ing even funds to defend herself against
her husband's charges. An order was is
sued directing young MacDonald to ap
pear before Judge Sloss Friday next and
show cause why he should not be com
pelled to furnish his wife with funds to
defray the cost of defending his suit and
to enable her to subsist without appealing
to the charity of relatives and friends.
DOES HIS OWN WASHING.
It may also have been brought about by
a knowiedge, mutually possessed, that
when a wife leaves a husband, or vice
versa, a year roust elapse before an ac
tion for divorce can be brought. At any
rate shortly after IX o'clock yesterd*ay
morning an action for divorce was filed
with Mrs. Beatrice Otway as plaintiff
and Michael Otway defendant. The
charge was desertion. Two hours later
the name of Otway was again placed on
the slip in the County Clerk's office con-l
tainlng the names of mlsmated couples
who desired freedom from matrimonial
bonds. In the second action, however,
the husband was the plaintiff, though the
charge was the same. It now remains for
the court to determine which of the Ot
ways Is guilty of desertion.
SAYS MAGEE IS BRUTAL.
It sometimes happens, and it is a pop
ular idea, that marriage is ths bringing
together bf two souls with but a single
thought. The marriage of Beatrice and
Michael Qtway is an instance. They
were married in May of last year, but It
was not until yesterday that they dis
covered that their minds were running
in the same strain. Perhaps the fact that
they separated just a year ago yesterday
had something to do with their oneness
of mind.

Two-thirds of the inmates of our hospitals are women. They are in most cases either for treatment
or for an operation, made necessary by advanced stages of female troubles which have resulted in ovaritis^
a tumor, or displacement of the womb.
"AN OPERATION NECESSARY."
Hott these words after the examination strike terror to a woman's soul, and with what regrets sna
hears them, when she considers that the operation has become necessary through her own neglect. Femala
derangements cannot cure themselves, and neglecting the warnings of nature only means putting it off until
there is no cure. The woman who lets her trouble make headway pays the penalty of a dangerous opera-
tion and a lifetime of impaired usefulness at the best, and the operation often proves fatal when her life
might have been saved by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
When women are troubled with irregular, suppressed or painful menstru-
ation, weakness, leucorrhoea, displacement or ulceration of the womb, that
bearing down feeling, inflammation of the ovaries, backache, bloating (or flatu-
lence), general debility, indigestion and nervous prostration ; or are beset with
such symptoms as dizziness, faintness, lassitude, excitability, irritability, ner-
vousness, sleeplessness, melancholy, and " want-to-be-left-alone " feelings, and
the blues, they should remember that there is one tried and never-failing
remedy; Lydia E. Pinkham's Compound at once removes such troubles.
READ THE FOLLOWING LETTERS.
â¢Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I cannot tell you how much good you have done me and how thankful I
am to you for it. For five years I have not been free from pain for a day. I have had backaches, headaches,
and those awful dragging sensations with leucorrhcea, and when menstruation appeared I was in such a
condition I could hardly sit up. I doctored all the tune, but nothing helped me, and I was told that an
operation was necessary.
" Two months ago a friend suggested that I try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. No
one knows what it has done for me and how thankful I am for it. It brought me the first well days I have
had for five years. It did for me what doctors could not do, and I want every suffering woman to know
about it."â Louise Katjeb, 761 E. 166th St., New York City. . Â«
"Dear Mrs. Pink ham: â I wish to thank you for whafc Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
has done for me. I had terrible hemorrhages/being lacerated from the birth of my child. The doctor told
me that if I would have an operation I would be well and strong. I submitted to it, but was worse than
before : no one knows what I suffered. Finally a friend advised me to try your Vegetable Compound ; I did
so, and commenced to feel better ; I continued its use, and it has done for me what doctors could not do. I
am strong and well If women with any kind of female troubles would- only consult you before submitting
to an operation they would be spared many hours of pain and suffering. I cannot thank you enough for
what you have done for me. w â Anna Kirchhoff, 156 E. 100th St., New York City.

One of the best stories told of the late
Sir Andrew Clarke is the following:
At a dinner party one night he noticed
that the lady sitting next to him at table
passed a dish to which v he helped him
self plentifully.
He asked If she did not like it, as it
was excellent. She replied:
"Oh. yes, I like it: but my physician
forbids me to eat it."
"Stuff and nonsense," said Sir Andrew;
"it could not hurt any one. Who Is your
physician."
To whom the lady, whom the medical
magnate had forgotten, answered, with a
demure twinkle in her eye:

LOS ANGELES. Sept 22. â There was not
much choice between Hall and Graham to-day
except in the matter of steadiness. Hall was
wild and his numerous passes to first Allowed
Oakland to win the game by opportune hitting.
There was plenty of snap to the game from
the start and the closeness of the score kept
the crowd Interested. The feature was the re
markable f.elding and batting cf Toman. Ha
accepted eleven chances at short, the majority
of them being difficult, and handled everything
without a blunder. In addition he got two
doubles and two singles in four times at bat.

Twas dead all the time, with no sensa
tions to vary the monotony, save the
steady pitching of Fitzgerald and the
even steadier support accorded him by
his teammates.
O'Brien was very wild and his curves
were never so effective as to fool the
Senators whenever they wished to hit
him. In the awful third he started bad
ly by hitlng Doyle. Delmas erred and
then followed hits and errors and bases
on balls, all of which aided the Senators
to make four runs. This gave them a
start that was as good as the game.
Fitzgerald was good at all times and
the home team never really had a chance
to score on him. He had the speed and
the curves and most of allâ the luck. This
stayed with him till the end and helped
him out of many tight places. The score:
The game was something like the ones
that "are generally played on the Oakland
lot and that is not saying much In its
favor.
It took the Senators just one inning,
the third, to rÂ«t familiar with the kind
which Mr. O'Brien had with him. yes
terday at Oakland baseball grounds.
When this had passed the score was 5 to
0. The Senators made one more ere the
game finally came to a peaceful close,
but not one of the native talent ever
rounded the last tnrn.

Without doubt the worst start seen this
year, judging from Its effect on the pub
lic, was la the Occidental handicap, for
which there were only six starters. Of
these Charles Elwood, the favorite, and
"Warranted, an outsider, were left at the
post and only four of the eix took part In
the race.
GRAVESEXD, N. T., Sept. 22-Hardly
a race decided at Graves/- nd to-day couia
be said to have been truly run, because
of the exceedingly bad starting and re
peated exhibitions of foul and question
able riding. After one race Higgins, the
lightweight rider, wa* conveyed to the
jockey-room with the toes of his left foot
broken, bruised flesh protruding through
the torn boot.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
In the preliminaries Jerry Fairchild was
given the decision over "Tanglefoot" Me-
Govern. Tho latter's seconds tossed a
towel in the ring in the fourth round.
George Brown of the West Oakland Ath
lptic Club was given the decision over
Young McConnell of the Reliance Club
In a ten-round bout that went the limit.
Feinting and clinching with a few light
lefts and right hooks by Cordell and ex
pert ducking by Angelli marked the open,
lnj? round. Ir. the second Jack sent home
a right stomach wallop and missed sev
eral rijrht uppercuta aimed at the jaw.
Joe had the tall fellow's head under his
arm at the gong. Angell hammered Cor
dell to the ropes with a volley of blows
at the opening of the third, but Jac^was
doine: the better milling at the close.
In the fourth round Cordell landed a
straight left on Angeli and floored him.
Joe was up with a bound and at hla man
viciously when corners were sounded.
Cordell brought the gore from Argeli" i
nose in the fifth and thereafter kept con
stantly Jabbing the sore organ. Joe came
out fest in tho sixth and sent several
rights to the face, bewildering Cordell.
This was the Italian lad's round. Both
were wild at tha commencement of the
seventh round, which ended In a slug
ging bee. Angell raised Cordell with body
punches in the eighth, but appeared to
tire toward the close. The ninth and
tenth were even, both boys fighting scien
tifically and Inflicting little noticeable
damage.
Cordell did some body punching In the
eleventh. In the twelfth Ansell wobbled
from an onslaught of right uppercuts and
slackened his pace for a breathing spell.
Tne thirteenth saw the swarthy boxer
hammer Cordell fiercely. Both resorted
to clinches in the fourteenth. Angell
rushed at the outset of the fifteenth and
for three minutes there was no surcease
of walloping.
Behind Cordell were Spider Kelly. Tim
McGrath and Ted "Wolfe. In Angeli's cor
ner were Eddie Hanlon. Harry Foley and
Fred Sanders.
Cordell had the advantage In height and
reach and displayed more devernesa than
did his opponent, but the little Italian
pugrilist was always on the firing Jlne
ready to meet the best shots hia oppo
nent sent and to turn loose his own bat
teries that were far from weak. Angeli
played continually for Jack's Jaw with
uppercuts. but Cordell's stature raado It
difficult for the shorter fighter to do much
execution In that direction. There were
many slam-bans mix-ups during the fif
teen periods, usually commencing a short
time before the bell.
Jack Cordell and Joe Angell failed to
prove which Is the superior at tha game
of fisticuffs In a flfteen-round bout last
night before the Reliance Club, Oakland.
It was a fast, fierce fight from start to
finish, and Referee EddlÂ© Smith'* declar
ation that honors were even was received
with general satisfaction.

County officers have not yet eucee'eded In ap

murderer of three women In that county last
Tuesday night.
The tackling o'f criminals calls for many
qualities, but it is after the arrest of a
suspected criminal, says T. P.'s Weekly,
that the most subtle part of the French
detective's art is called into play. The
French authorities do not consider a case
against an accused man complete, unless
he has actually confessed his guilt, and it
is to the agents of the Surete that the
magistrates look to obtain this conclusive
proof. A detective makes' friends with the
prisoner, pretends to sympathize with him
In his* trouble and tells him that it .will
certainly ease his mind if he makes a
clean breast of the whole affair. Or he
works on his feelings by kindness. It is
usual at the Surete to give the prisoner a
good lunch and to take advantage of his
resultant expanslveness to get him to
talk. It may be remarked that though
prisoners are led to believe that their
confession will be taken into account by
the Judges and Jury in apportioning sen
tence, In practice the contrary is the case.
The man who confesses is lost. This fact
prompted' a notorious murderer named
Avinain to address to the public at his
execution this supreme recommendation,

Antonio Gularte was neld to answer be
fore the Superior Court by Police Judge
Fritz yesterday on a charge of arson in
$3000 bonds. He is accused of having: set
fire to his barber shop at 415% Powell
street on the morning of September 12.
Flames were discovered in two separate
rooms and there was evidence that coal
oil had been plentifully utilized.
The Judge in holding the defendant said:
"It was mv intention at first to make
the bonds $10,000, but I think $5000 is
enough. The crime is a flagrant one, as
the defendant must have known that the
chances were that sixteen lives might
have been sacrificed by his act, that num
ber of people having been asleep at the
time in the lodging-house above his shop.
Besides, as the buildings In that block
are all built close together there is no
saying what the damage might have been
if the fire had not been discovered in
time."

ALAMEDA. Sept. 22.â With all the dls
'Â¦ cussions of the railroad franchises at cau
: cuses, conferences, meetings and mass
meetings, there are still those who be
lieve that certain phases of the agitation
have not yet been brought out and among
the residents holding that view are a
number of the Park street business men
not affiliated with the Board of Trade.
Twelve of these to-day issued the fol
lowing call for a meeting of the mer
chants and tradesmen of Alameda:
We, the undersigned merchants and trades
men in the city of Alameda, believing that an
erroneous impression prevails among our fel
low-citizens respecting our attitude on tha
questions before our City Trustees at this
time, and desiring to correct said false Im
pression as soon as possible, hereby request
the merchants and tradesmen of our city to
meet in Eureka Hall, in the Masonic Temple,
corner of Park street and Alameda avenue, on
Thursday, the 24th inat.. at 8 o'clock p. "m.
J. J. Konlgshofer, F. Binder. H. SI liram
ttian. L Durein. A. O. Gott, Olson & Co.. A.
.Victors. E. D. Judd. J. E. Baker, J. W. Hew,
G. Schaeffer. J. B. Vosburgh Company.
In the notice the "questions before our
City Trustees" means the two applica
tions for franchises for local steam roads
filed by the Southen Pacific Company with
the municipal legislators. The signers of
the call feel that much has been said
and done in their name during the agi
tation that they were not responsible for
and in no way approved. Their purpose
is to dispel the general Impression that
a majority of the merchants of Alameda

It was Professor Frank Soule's turn to
stand the grill of an attorney's cross
examination into his private affairs to
day. In the hearine of his petition to
be relieved of paying $75 a month ali
mony it has been his former wife, so far,
who has been on the stand in an en
deavor to resist his plea that she is in no
need of the money.
In answer to questions Professor Soule
stated that his salary is $275 a month,
and that since ISM $75 a month of this
has pone toward the support of his chil
dren. He bought a house for $4500 ajid
still owes $1500 on it. He said he has
had to economize to live on $200; that he
has to limit himself in the purchase of
books he needs in connection with his
profession. He denied that part of the
answer to his petition where the attor
ney for Mrs. Soule stated that he had
agreed to pay his wife $75 a month ali
mony for tho remainder of her life in
consideration cf her relinquishing her
right to certain property claimed by both
of them. He said that the first he had
heard of such an agreement was when
he read it in the answer to his petition.
He said that the $75 a month had come
voluntarily from him at the suggestion
of his attorney, who told him he ought
to do somethinc for his children, but
that there never had been any agree
ment to this effect and that he had never
talked to any one on the subject except
his attorny.
Professor Soule was subjected to a rigid
cross-examination on this point, but this
part of the testimony the attorney for
Mrs. Soule was unable to change.

The Orthodox Congregation of Beth
Jacob held fitting services for the new
year yesterday and to-day.
The Jewish New Year, or Rosh Ho
shana, the observance of which was be
gun last night, was continued this morn
ing by special devotional services at the
First Hebrew Congregation. . '
Rabbi M. Kriedlander delivered a ser
mon on "Tho Kingdom of God."
The rabbi described the ancient cus
tcms cf the Hebrew .race and dwelt at
length upon the history of the people and
the persecutions which have been heaped
upon them by the races of the earth.
In brief he said:
â¢ The highest and grfatest significance of Ju
daism ia the acknowledgment of the kingdom
of God. The new year to the Jew is a declara
tion and expression of his faith. In celebrat
ing this day the .Jew declares that God is su
preme sovereign of the universe, tho heaven
above and the earth below. He acknowledges
C!cd as the father, ruler end guiding power of
mail's destiny.
In that which is symbolized by the new
year rests the entire doctrine of Judaism. Th>s
Jew's btllet is in God. He denies the philos
ophy of the eternity of matter. He believes In
the design and purpose of the Supreme Being,
In fatherhood and brotherhood. He declares
his belief in the harmony of purpose of nature
and history.
In connection with the exercises an im
pressive musical service was given under
the direction of Miss Virgrinie de
Fremery.
The choir which furnished the music to
day was composed of: Sopranos, Miss
Mary C. Williams, Mrs. Carrie Brown
Dexter; altos. Mrs. Grace Carroll Elliott,
Miss Feldheim; tenors: E. D. Crandall,
Mr. Evans; bassos, Clement Rowlands,
John Williams.
This choir will be retained during the
holidays. Three days hence comes the
feast of guedaliah. when the orthodox
Jew abstains from food and water. Other
days of importance during the festival
season are the feast of the tabernacles
on the fifteenth day and the rejoicing of
the law on the twenty-first day.

The strikers on the California North

email river steamer came alongside the
wharf with a load of 700 sacks of wheat
intended for shipment to interior points
over the railroad. As soon as the strik
ers learned of the situation they waited
on the stevedores on the steamer and
after some argument got them to refuse
to unload the cargo. The affair was con
ducted in a very quiet manner.

ST. PAUL, Sept. 22.â Negotiations be
tween the officials of tho Great Northern
and the firemen and engineers are prac

tho road have denied the requests of the
men and rescinded grants made at pre
vious meetings. Grand Master Hanrahan
of the Locomotive Firemen and J. J.
Stone, grand chief of the Brotherhood of
Engineers, held a conference this after
noon with the railroad officials. The
meeting between the labor leaders and
the general manager and general super
intendent of the Great Northern did not
develop any marked change in the situa
tion. None of those taking part in the
negotiations would make any formal
statement as to the status of affairs fur
ther than to say that there would be a
resumption of negotiations to-morrow
morning. 1$ is understood, however, from
authoritative sources that the prospects
for a peaceful settlement are much bright
er to-night than they were considered be
fore this afternoon's conference. The ac
tion of the company officials in with
drawing their assent to the amendments
to the rules previously granted at the
request of the grievance committee an
gered tha men and some of them were
in favor of taking an immediate poll of
the locals on the auestion of a strike.
The presence of the grand officers, how
ever, served to relieve the tension and
negotiations were resumed, and it is said
a disposition is shown to reach a peaceful
compromise.
No detailed statement of what the men
ask could be obtained either from the
company officials or from the men them
selves. Their demands comprise, how
ever, both a new wage schedule and sev
eral changes in the working rules.
In conclusion, he writes that he hopes
to retain the confidence of his constituents
at the general election which "cannot be
far distant"
Regarding retaliation and fiscal free
dom, Elliot agrees with Premier Balfour's
pamphlet that the Government should be
free to consider cases as they arise on
their merits and take such action as it
considers right, subject to the approval of
Parliament.
LONDON, Sept. 22.â Premier Balfour Is
apparently meeting considerable difficulty
in the task of reconstructing his Cabinet.
It is said that Wyndham has been offered
the choice of several portfolios, but has
decided to remain Chief Secretary for
Ireland. ,
- Owing' to the decision that the Fifth
and Sixth Army Corps of War Secretary
Brodrick's scheme shall not be constitut
ed, because of the lack of necessary re
cruits, it is reported that General Hunter,
who was nominated for the command of
the Sixth Corps, Is to be transferred to
India, to command either the Bombay or
Madras district. This has led to renewed
rumors that General Hunter will succeed
Lord Kitchener as 'commander in chief
in India and that the latter will be called
home to succeed Brodrick as. Secretary of
War.
All this, however. Is merly speculation.
Much public feeling has been displayed
against appointing Brodrick to the India
office and it is believed the difficulty cen
ters in providing a Secretary for War
and a Secretary for India.
Arthur D. Elliot, who has just resigned
the Financial Secretaryship of the Treas
ury because of his disagreement with
Premier Balfour's finance views, writing
to one of his constituents in Durham
City, says he is in complete agreement
with the free trade views of ex-Chancel
lor of the Exchequer Ritchie, who found
it impossible to. hold office any longer in
a Government which is tending steadily
toward a policy of protection. He could
not remain in office, he says, without an
entire loss of self-respect. The time has
arrived, he continues, when the electors
must decide for or against the policy of
taxing imports of food which, though de
ferred for the moment, will be the ulti
mate issue.

Colonel Morley wa3 about fifty years of
age and had a wife and six children, one
of whom, a son, is attending college at
Chester, Pa. Morley came to Buena Vista
in 1849. slnee which time he has been
prominently identified with the smelter
and mining industries In the district.
From the position of the bodies when
found it appeared that Abrahamson had
been carrying Morley after he lost con
sciousness and had made a desperate
struggle to reach fresh air with his hu
man load. In all probability .Abrahamson
could have saved himself had ho not made
this heroic effort to rescue his companion.
BUENA VISTA, Colo., Sept. 22.â Colonel
B. F. Morley, manager of the Buena Vista
smelter and of the Mary Murphy mine
at Romley, and Adolph Abrahamson,
superintendent of the mine.- were killed
by foul air when making an inspection of
the mine workings last night. Their
bodies were recovered to-day.
It is supposed that the air In the mine
had been vitiated by powder gas. The
property is not operated at night and
there were no other men in the mine when
Morley and Abrahamson were making
their tour of inspection which resulted
fatally.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Mrs. Crawley as Viola was fully as
fascinating as in the title role in "Every
man." Her resonant voice soeirhded to
good advantage In the difficult double
part of Viola and Catsario. Her counter
part, Sebastian, brother of Viola, was
cleverly acted by Mrs. C. Arthur Collins.
Ben Greet, however, was the favorite with
the audience. His portrayal of the pomp
ous conceit of Malvollo drew forth rounds
of merited applause. Scarcely second to
the hit made by Ben Greet was the suc
cess scored by Robert Smiley as Sir Toby
Belch.
Two scenes In the play stood out most
prominently for their eleven: execution.
The first was that in Olivia's home, when
Sir Tobv and Sir Andrew, deep in their
cups, disturbed the household and brought
forth Malvollo clad in night attire. The
second was at the gathering of the mirth
ful conspirators after the ruse with the
forged letter had been successfully work
ed on Malvollo. The Joy and laughter
of the players in the latter scene proved
so contagious that the laughter and ap
plause of the audience quite drowned the
mock mirth of the actors. The cast of
characters was as follows:
Duke Orslne, John Sayer Crawley: Sebastian.
Beatrice "Whitney; Antonio, Cllve- Currlo; Val
entine. Mildred Jones; Curao. Cecilia Griffith:
Blr Toby Belch. Robert Smiley; Sir Andrew
Agruecheek, Robert Halrord Forster: Malvollo.
Ben Greet; Fabian, C. Arthur Collins; Feste,
a clown. Dallas Anderson; a priest, 8. H.
Goodwyn; Olivia. Alys Rees; Viola. Constance
Crawley; Maria. Margaret Bucklln.
At the completion of the play the audi
ence rose and applauded continuously un
til the players reappeared. Ben Greet in
thanking the assemblage said:
"I want to thank you heartily on be
half of myself, my company and Mr.
Frohman for the royal welcome extended
us, and I commend Stanford University
in its endeavor to foster the drama."
This was the first production on tne
coast of "Twelfth Night" by ths Proh
man company. "Twelfth Night" was
given In Its entirety as written by Shake
speare, and the Idea of the Elizabethan
stage was carried out to the letter. The
action was continuous; at no time did
the curtain intervene to show the change
of scene. The orchestra, dressed In
Elizabethan costumes, and stationed In
tho balcony, filled In the breaks ta the
action with music in keeping with tho
staging of the play.
The stage Itself appeared the same in
the foreground as In "Everyman," but In
the back tapestries of ancient pattern
supplanted the monastery walls used in
the morality play. Two "Beef-eaters." as
they are called, dressed in red and carry
ing battle-axes, stood guard at the end
of tho stage.
STAFFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 72.â
In striking contrast to the solemnity of
laA night's production of "Everyman" by
Ben Greet's company was the lightness of
"Twelfth Night," presented by the tame
players in Assembly Hall to-night.
Though the attendance was perhaps
smaller than at tho presentation of
"Everyman," yet the reception accorded
"Twelfth Night" was fully as enthusias
tic as that given to the morality play and
was evidenced by the full measure of
laughter and applause that the comedy
drew forth.

18 years of age, charged with petty lar
ceny, was called before Police Judge Fritz
yesterday Edward Hansen,* a yÂ«rang car
penter, stepped forward and toSd^. the
Judge that he had been keeping company

willing to marry Her. He said they both
belonged to Petaluma, where the girl's
father was a dealer in cattle. The Judge
said he did not like to have the girl dis
graced by convicting her of petty larceny
and allowed her to go on her own recog

in Petaluma and prepare for. her wed
ding. The case was continued for a week.

Local Inspectors O. F. Bolles and J. K.
Bulger made the following report yester
day to Supervising Inspector Berming
ham:
In the matter of the investigation of the
cause of the burning of the donkey boiler of
tho Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
steamer Umatilla, upon examination of the
marine engineers of said steamer for allowing
the water to becoraeT low in the donkey boiler
on the morning of tho occurrence (September
4. 1903). we find that First Assistant Engineer
John W. Haughton Second Assistant Thomas
Concannon and Third Assistant Robert B.
Gor8 were on watch at different times on the
morning of the 4th while the fires were lit
under the donkey boiler, and that during that
time the water became so low that the in
ner sheet of the combustion chamber and the
back head of the boiler were badly damaged.
It was impossible for us from the testimony
taken to place the blame directly or solely on
any of the licensed officers, to justify a revo
catlcn of license, but we do find that all three
of the assistant engineers were Inattentive to
their duties in so far as they failed to dis
cover that there was not sufficient water In
the boiler on the occasion in question.
For such inattention to duty we have this
day suspended the license of each the above
named engineers for a period of fifteen days
from date.
Chief Engineer Wolters is exonerated from
blame in the matter.
Licenses of Three Officers of the
Umatilla Are Suspended for
Fifteen Days.

AND COMMITS SUICIDE
Wealthy San Diego Resident Shoots
Himself Immediately After
the Purchase.
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 22.-CaptaIn H. J.
Teel, who resided in this city for the
past four years, shot and instantly killed
himself to-day. He had long suffered
various afflictions of the body and was
partially crippled. He entered a gunstone
on H street this morning, asked to look
at some revolvers and selected a second
hand one, for which he paid $4 50. He
asked if it was loaded and on being in
formed that it was he started for the
door, but before reaching It placed the
weapon to his head and pulled the trigger.
Captain Teel was possessed of consider
able means, pwning 1 valuable property'
near Ashland, Or., and Sacramento. He
was 70 years of age and leaves a wife of
about the same age.
The inspectors will therefore be re
lieved from duty until Monday, October
5. 1903, and the Health Board will pro
ceed to appoint temporary inspectors from
the civil service eligible list during the
interim. Yesterday a requisition was
sent by the Health Board to the Civil
Service Commission asking the last named
body to certify the names of four eli
gibles from the list of assistant sanitary
inspectors.
The Civil Service Commission at once
certiiied the names of Fred C. Muller,
Joseph Kukendall, Fred Howe and Reu
ben Hill. The certification of these names
exhausted the eligible list and Dr. Fred
C. Muller was at once appointed by
O'Brien to look after the district former
ly supervised by Dr. Fitzgibbons. In all
likelihood Drs. Kukendall, Howe and Hill
will receive appointments to the tempo
rary vacancies to-day, that Is, if they
express a willingness to serve the city for
such a short period as two weeks. Should
they not accept appointment the Health
Board will find itself in a dilemma, as
three districts will remain without sani
tary inspection for the time stated.
APPOINTS TO VACANCIES.
The four inspectors were unwilling to
submit tamely to suspension and there
fore Dr. Fitzgibbons, one of the suspend
ed men, sent a communication to Health
Officer O'Brien asking him to rescind his
action. Dr. O'Brien immediately sent
communications in reply, one of which
says: . % -
September 21. 1903.
Dr. F. T. Fitzgibbons: After deliberation
and consultation with members of the Health
Board who are familiar with the dereliction in
your case, It hÂ£is been concluded that the sus
pension must stand aa originally o/dered.
A. P. O'BRIEN. Healtft Officer.
Health Officer O'Brien, acting under au
thority from the Health Board, was of
the opinion that a suspension of two
weeks was severe enough to meet the
exigencies of the case. In this way the
suspended inspectors avoided the humil
iation of a trial before the Civil Service
Commission.
Action was taken under the provisions
of section 12,- article 13, which states that
"nothing shall limit the power of any of
ficer or board to suspend a subordinate
for a reasonable period, not exceeding
thirty days." For any suspension in ex
cess of thirty days action can only be
taken on charges properly filed with the
Civil Service Commission, as the sanitary
inspectors are appointed from the eligi
ble list. The charter provides that no
civil service appointee can be removed ex
cept for cause and then only after a hear
ing in which the accused may be given
an opportunity to defend himself.
Tho Board of Health has suspended As
sistant Sanitary Inspectors Frank T.
Fitzgibbons, Jonathan Green, "William S.
Hereford and Roland E. Hartley. The
suspensions are temporary, dating from
September 21 to October 5 and the cause
alleged in a communicatnon sent on Mon
day to the four suspended officials is "the
continuous unsatisfactory performance of
their duties in the districts to which they
are assigned from the beginningof the
present fiscal year."
The suspensions were made by Health
Officer A. P. O'Brien, only, however, af
ter consultation with the individual mem
bers of the Board of Health. Complaints
had been made to O'Brien that the four
Inspectors, all of whom are physicians,
had been negligent in their inspections of
the districts under their immediate super
vision and Dr. O'Brien declared that the
complaints warranted the disciplining of
the inspectors by temporarily suspending
them. The greatest secrecy has been
maintained by the Health Board regard
ing the suspensions, as it was not desired
to injure the physicians under fire in their
professional capacity.

The Chief advised Snow that if Gold
man attempted to do him any injury to
notify him and he' would promptly at
tend to the matter, but he heard nothing
further from Snow.
"For services in Oakland and San Fran
cisco as epecial attendant during attacks
of temporary insanity from March, 1902,
to date, $1000; less cash received, $650â
$350."
"The djarge of $1000 for attendance upon
me," saiS Goldman, "is simply an at
tempt on the part of Snow to escape re
paying to me the $700 he borrowed from
me. I have never been temporarily in
sane and Snow has never rendered me
any services as special attendant. I shall
prosecute him civilly and criminally to
the end."
Goldman and Snow had an encounter
in Oakland one day last week and one
of the papers there reported that Snow
was badly beaten up. but it was reported
in another paper that Snow held his own
against his younger antagonist.
Tnat Snow has been afraid of Goldman
doing him personal injury for some time
was referred to by Chief Wittman after
he learned of the issuance of the war
rant. The Chief said that Snow had
called upon him last January and asked
for police protection from Goldman. He
told the Chief that Goldman had been
annoying him to such an extent that he
had been forced to leave Oakland and
take up his residence in this city. Gold
man had found out his residence here and
one night met him and told him, as he
displayed a keen^edged butcher knife,
that nothing would please him better
than to drink a cupful of Snow's blood.
"A. Goldman to R. W. Snow
A. Goldman, a merchant at 007 Wash
ington street, Oakland, secured a war
rant from Police Judge Fritz yesterday
for the arrest of R. \V. Snow, ex-Mayor
of Oakland, on a charge of libel. Gold
man was accompanied by his attorney.
Frank J. Murphy, who said that a civil
suit would be instituted by Goldman
against Snow for $5000 damages and for
the recovery of $700 which Goldman al
leges he loaned to Snow.
The alleged libel was contained in the
following account sent, it is claimed,
through the mails by Snow to Goldman

Nine years of litigation was ended yes
terday In the United States Circuit Court
by the handing down of a decision in two
of the celebrated Santa Cruz water bonds
cases. The two suits were entitled Waite
vs. city of Santa Cruz and were brought
to recover $27,000 and $14,000 respectively,
the alleged value of bonds and
issued by the city for the purpose of ob
taining a water supply. At the time of
the commencement of the action Albert
H. Waite held the legal title to all of
the bonds and coupons. Shortly after
ward Waite died In Massachusetts and on
March 2, 1903, on' an order of the Probate
Court of Massachusetts, the administra
trix, Helen E. Waite, transferred all
Waite's interest in the bonds and coupons
to John' M. -Graham. On April 1 of the
same year F. A. Hlhn, for a valuable
consideration, became the owner, and on
April 15 Hihn delivered to the city of
Santa Cruz the bonds and coupons men
tioned in the complaint and agreed that
they should bear interest at 4 per cent
per annum from said date.
Upon a stipulation, wherein all the
above mentioned facts were agreed upon.
Judge de Haven, sitting as a Circuit
Judge, rendered judgment for both
amounts sued for, interest upon the judg
ments to run at 4 Der cent.
When the city of Santa Cruz issued the
water bonds the authorities entered into a
contract with certain "promoters" to dis
pose of the entire issue. The "promoters"
disposed of the bonds, pocketed the pro
ceeds and then went *into bankruptcy.
When suit was brought against their
sureties for the amount collected it was
found that the promoters had organized a
company consisting mainly of themselves
and had put up the sureties for them
selves. This company also went into
bankruptcy, and the bonds having been
Bold to Innocent purchasers, and having
been legally issued, the city was respon
sible for their payment and was obliged
to Issue a duplicate set of bonds to ob 1
tain Its water supply. Suits for the re
mainder of the first Issue of the bonds
are pending in the Federal courts on ap
peal.
COL.TOX, Sept. 22.â W. I* Baugus. con
ductor of a Southern Pacific work train
running in and out of Declez Quarry*
east of here, was found dead beside the
track early this morning with his head
crushed to an almost urecognizable mass.
The body was discovered by a section
crew two miles east of this city. Baugus
had evidently been murdered by powerful
blows on the head.
It is presumed by the railroad officials
that he came- to Colton yesterday to cash
his pay check and that on his return,
either In the Colton yards or further out,
he was set upon by thugs, beaten to
death and robbed of the $130 -which he !â¢
supposed to have had with him.
One theory Is that the man's body was
carried out of Colton on a handcar and
thrown into the ditch during the night,
as there were few signs of a struggle
where hÂ« was found.
The prisoner at the bar was rightfully tried
and convicted for the larceny of a dog and
cannot be discharged upon habeas corpus.
? â¢ * However, I am satisfied that In our
condition In this territory a dog is property of
a high pecuniary value, and Is the subject of
larceny under the very principle upon which
the common law determined that question.
Last winter a whole population of Â¦ civil
ized men and women invaded the dense wilder
ness of the Tanana Valley, crossing the snowy
mcruntalns amid the blizzards of Arctic blasts,
and established permanent towna and min
ing camps there, depending upon this valuable
animal aa their sole beast of burden and only
means of transportation. Hundreds of ani
mals of the best breeds have been Imported
Into the territory from the States as well as
from the British territories, and the dog has
a fixed and definite value as a beast of burden
in Alaska, second to no other animal. He Is
to the far northland what the horse was to
the development of- the great plains west cf
the Mississippi. It cannot be presumed that
Congress was ignorant of his history and value
to the people of Alaska when it passed the
Penal Code. ,Thls court will not. by a limited
construction, exclude the dog from the pro
tection of the Penal Code of Alaska nor ought
it to do violence to the well established rule
of decisions declaring the animal not the sub
ject of larceny under the common law.
SOLE BEAST OF BURDEN.
â¢ â¢ â¢ "U'hen the news of the distovery of
the Klondike and Nome gold Heidi attracted
thousands of American miners into this re-
Klon, he was found to be the most ready, use
ful and active animal in aiding them to reach
the mines. From that day to this he has
been the constant companion of the prospector,
the miner and the freighter, and without his
aid -and sagacity the efTorts of even American
miners to develop the gold fields must have
languished. He has served the cause of jus
tice and aided In the establishment of the
courts, and the Judge of this court has traveled
hundreds of miles along Alaska trails each
winter upon vehicles drawn tiy the docs. In
the performance of his official duties.
Gold dust is net mentioned In either sec
tion, yet It has never been doubted that its
theft might be punished as larceny. A dis
tinction, however, is urged between the theft
of these classes of property and that of dogs,
and this distinction is based upon the alle
gation that swine, sheep and gold dust are
property, the theft of which is punishable at
common law. while the taking of a dog never
was and Is not now larceny at common law.
Nevertheless, a dog is a chattel. â¢ , â¢ â¢
Whoever has made even the slightest study
of the ethnology of Alaska or has given to
Its present development a minute's thought
knows that the dog has betn. next to man, the
most important factor in its past and present
history.
THE DOG IN ALASKA.
This vital question comes up on an ap
peal filed yesterday in the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals In the case of
P.' C. Burkal, now in jail at Rampart,
Alaska, for taking possession of a dog
without consent of his master. The Judge
of the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Alaska convicted
Burkal and rendered an elaborate opin
ion In effect that no matter what a dog
might be in England and In America, the
dog was property in Alaska and a man
could be convicted for stealing one. The
animal which Mr. Burkal took under the
common law was valued at $34, a petty
larceny value, and Burkal was sentenced
to nine months' imprisonment. Judge
Wickersham emitted the following jewels
in deliverinR his opinion:
The dog If not specifically mentioned In
the statute of Alaska among the animals or
other property subject to larceny. If it is prop
erty whose taking is larceny, it must be be
cause it is Included in the meaning of "goods
and chattels" whess taking Is made larceny by
Section 41 of the Penal Code. â¢ â¢ â¢ Sec
tion 4:5 does not specifically mention swine or
fiheep as the subject of larceny, yet it will not
be claimed that they may be taken without
punishment.
Under common law of England a dog
Iv not property, and the stealing of one
is not a crime, 'not even a misdemeanor,
no matter how valuable the animal may
be.
- "Is a dog property?" is a question, that
has been submitted to the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for a legal an
swer.

WHEAT â Liverpool futures were weaker and
PariB futures higher.
Chicago ' was fractionally firmer on steady
eables, a good export business and a belief
that the selling fever was exhausted. A good
deal of long Wheat came out during the day,
however. '
This market was easier for cash grain and
firmer for futures. Holders were reported more
willing to sell, but buyers were not willing to
take hold.

NEW YORK. Sept. 22. â There was no
change to-day in the narrow and professional
character of the sto<-k market. The dullness
and lassitude were Knrwwhat arefntuated by
the- occurrence of the Jewish New Year, v.hich
cauF<-<i an ab.srnce of a part of the membership
of the Kxchange. The price movement was
an inversion of that of yesterday, the advance
c.>minÂ«: early and the reaction later with price I
changes unimportant. Kor the first time in a ,
number of days UnitÂ»<l States Steel did net ;
touch a new low record anJ this was taten by
the leaders to indicate that liquidation in
that security was over. They marked uy the Â¦
Trice aocordmffiy and the advance in the gen- Â¦
eral mr.rket was litt!e more than a syinpa- ]
t h*-tic response to thit" movement. Late in the J
day urgent yelling j.rep?ure developed in the I
1'nlted States Jfttel secend- mortKage - bonds. |
They were forced down to 73. which is "j low- ,
tr than their j-ievicus low record. This ;
rromj.ud the traders to thr-.w over the stocks ;
they had taken *ar!icr in the day and wiped :
cut t!i^ day j edv&nce, with th3 result that j
Email looses nre interspersed with- small net ;
gains. Tbe buylns movement of the morning Â¦
was largely concentrated, a single house being
Credited with the purchase of no less than j
Ao.itfiO rhares arcund the room. There was Â¦
little in the news of the day to account for the j
movement of r>ricep. The r-cllapse of the -ef- 1
fort:; to save the Consolidated Lake Supfrior !
Company from bankruptcy seemed to have i
Deen discounted and may even have been a j
factor in the recover}' of United States Steel, j
The removal of the prcspeÂ«,-t of the immediate ;
demands ujjon capital to ketp this compaJiy j
artoat seemed to afford a srim rort of relief
in the Â»pirit of dread of corporation credit re
quirements which Wall street has come to
The same spirit was responsible for the Â«harp
dr^p in New York Central on revival of rejwrts
that the company vas negotiating a large loan i
to provide for Its Immediate requirement in I
connection with the terminal improvements in j
this city. The news from the crops continued j
favorable, the Weather Bureau's weekly re- j
l<ort receiving a bearish interpretation both as

Receipts of Potatoes were light and the
market was steady under a fair demand for
local use. The demand from outside points
continued very Hsht and shipping stock
dragged at unsteady prices. There were 746
tacks of Oregon .Burbanka received by thÂ«
Portland steamer, but they arrived too late
to be sold and were held over for to-day's
market. Sweet Potatoes moved off well and
prices were firmer. One car came in from
Merced. Previous prices ruled for Onions,
which were in free supply.
Stocks of vegetables, while light, were am
ple, and changes in prices were slljjht. To
matoes continued to arrive freely and were
rather weak than otherwise, with low grade
offerings of bay going to the canners at the
minimum quotation. Prices of String Beans
ranged hipher. while Wax and Lima Beans
wera steady at the previously quoted rates.
Green Corn continued firm under light receipts
and Cucumbers and Summer Squash cleaned
up well at steady rates. Green Peppers, Okrn

The Wool market is still hampered by the
strike, which is only partially settled. Busi
ness Is practically at a standstill, but there i*
no serious accumulation of stock, as there Is
not much coming in. The local trade say
that the starting prices this season were too
high and that a reaction was bound to cc
cur sooner or later. The Eastern markets are
reported in fair condition and this market
would be likewise were it not for the strike.
Hops arÂ» fairly active and firm. Oregons
are selling below Callfornias. as they are show,
ing damage from mold and vermin. Local
dealers report that during the past two years
the picking of California Hops has not been
up to Â»he usual standard, owing to the high
prices, and that the bales from some districts
oftea contain stems and leaves, which are
hurting thÂ» reputation at our Hops as a su
perior article. They say that If this practice
Is continued permanent Injury to the business

S ' "AN OLD SALT." |
8 Tree Art Picture With Next g
8 SUNDAY'S CALL. |
Â£ U
O "An Old Salt," by the Belgian S
8 artist, A. Boudry, Is not only an >â¢Â£
8 example of vigorous and skillful S
w brush work, but a fine bit of char- Q
Â« acter study. The type portrayed Is Â«
X one of those old men of the sea, bluff o
S and sturdy, hardened by rude la- S
g bor, danger, and exposure to the jQ
Q elements: They are apt to be curt M
~ of speech and often so taciturn 8
8 that the appellation "a sad sea Â«
Â« dog" is fittingly bestowed upon >*
g them. In most of them, however, ft
<^ there Is generally concealed be- o
Â£$ neath their rough exterior a large Jj;
S heart and often a vein of humor, 8
p* which only requires an occasion to 8
8 be brought out. *
Â« The effect of wear and exposure
S to variable weather upon the gar- SS
S ments of those who toil on the sea, o
JO or in the fields, is to destroy their Q
S color and bring various colors Into 8
8 a harmony of neutral tones .which &
8 is nearly always picturesque and 8
g agreeable to the eye. The broken Q
'A and subdued colors of this picture Q
jÂ§ are well suited to its subject, and S
o the artist has cleverly compensated Â§'
8 for their lack of brilliancy by a Q
S vigorous effect of light and dark 8
S and the rich imparts of his paint- 8
S Ing. The last named quality is re- Q
Â» Â¦ produced by the process employed
Â£; in making The Call art supple-
g ments with a . truthfulness unap- #
D proached by any other. One might 0.
Q readily imagine at a first glance O
8 that the rough surface of the can- Â§
is vas had been reproduced by em- 3
g bossing. 8
Â« A. Boudry Is a native of Belgium Â«
q and has his studio In Antwerp. He #
Q has made a specialty of picture Â«
# which have for their subjects Q
S scenes and types of people "of the S
8 sea, . His -work Is highly appreciat- S
S ed In his own country, J where he S
Â£f has received many honors, and his w
$ reputation and the sale of his work Â«
Â« in America are steadily Increasing. 8

The San Francisco Eye
Assessor Dodge said yesterday what if
the Supreme Court should reaffirm its de
cision on an appeal that the State Board
of Equalization has the power to assess
Btreet railroads operating In two counties
it will result in lowering the assessment
loll of this city and county by $1,500,000.
VV'hen the decision was first announced
the Board of Equalization immediately
distributed the assessment of the United
Railroads so that the assessment of San
Maico County was raised by 51,500,000 and
a corresponding decrease was made in
this clty'B assessment.
If the decision !s reaffirmed it will mean
a loss of approximately $15,000 in taxes
*hlch were to have been collected by
this city on that portion of the assess
ment of the United Railroads which was
transferred to San Mateo County. The
municipal budget will therefore show a
deficit of about 1 13.000 in the appropria
tions which will have to be made up in
other ways.
Auditor Harry J. Baehr yesterday put
a force of clerks to work carrying out
the taxes on the assessment rolls at the
rate of Â£4.4 cents fixed by the Board of
Supervisors on the increased valuation
made by the State Board of Equalization.
The combined rate for city and State pur
poses is $1,405 on every $100 assessed val
uation. Under the City Attorney's opinion
mandamus proceedings will be brought
to compel Baehr to'ngure the assessment
for city purposes at the rate of $1,076,
edopted by the Supervisors in June last.
In this way the legality of the revised
rate 'will be decided by the Supreme
Court and the disputed point settled.

Decreased by Sum
of $1,500,000.

this country and taken to China when a
child. . ;;
Either an "uncle" or a "cousin would
testify that he had known the applicant
as a child in this country and had seen
him in recent years' in China. Unless the
Federal courts could catch the witnesses
in false testimony the evidence had to be
accepted.
Many cases are on record where the
Chinese claiming to be native born
Americans have requested the courts to
be remanded. It is believed that these
acts were only part of a plot to secure
th<\Â» admission of young Chinese and al
low the substitution of aged Mongolians
who desired to go back to China and do
so at the expense of others.
In the search for evidence against the
ring Secret Service Agent. Burns and his
associates are confronted with
difficulties.
HIGHER GAME SOUGHT.
The cunning of the Chinese is well
known; but tho investigating officials do
not think that the plot of substitution
was hatched simply by Chinese aided by
the three deputy shenffs and the deputy
marshal who killed himself.
Higher game is being sought and no
steps will be left unturned to implicate
all the parties to the crime of fraud and
bring, them to the bar of Justice.
A certain coterie of attorneys has
waxed rich by handling the cases of the
Chinese who, denied 'landing, seek the
relief of the Federal courts.
Chinese interpreters can be seen con
stantly visiting the offices of these attor
neys, and It would not? be surprising 1 if
the Federal Â«lragmet caaght some of the
attorneys who constantly figure as repre
sentatives of Chinese clients.
Two Federal officials jre known to have
maintained very friendly relations with
Tom Yung, the Chinese arrested in con
nection with the substitution frauds. One
of the substituted Chirese confessed that
Tom Yung gave him $35 to serve as one
of the substitutes.
SUSPECT OTHER DEPUTIES.
Secret Service Agent Burns Is looking
closely Into the record and habits of
some of the deputy .sheriffs who served on
the night watch at the County Jail.
The accused deputy sheriffs, Burnett,
Dasha and Dempsey, acted as the night
\7atch for two weeks at a time and then
would do duty In the daytime.
Dempsey. one of the accused deputy
sheriffs, has declared that others were the
'Teal grafters" and that when the time
comes he will talk. Demnsey is not doing
much talking since his release on bail ami
his session before the United States
Grand Jury Is thought to have resulted
in something more than a mere confes
sion of his impllca*ion In the substitution
frauds.
Burnett ancl DafhaVare keeping very
quiet ir.Â«*Â« will not talk about their cam*.
It. Is thought In certain circles that the
accused deputy sheriff? will assist the au
thorise-* In rourding w every party to
the frauds nnÂ«i itciely necure lmmanlty
froni runlsliment.
For that reason the Federal officials are
loth to discuss the case, fearing that some
of those suspected of the frauds may
make their escape.
Japanese Woman Eemanded.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday denied the application of Tone
Takagi for a writ of habeas corpus. Mrs.
Takagl, a Japanese, arrived on the Ching
Wo on September 12 with' a little daugh
ter. The girl was afflicted with a conta
gious disease of the eyes and was denied
a landing for that reason. The mother
also was denied a landing for the reason
that as guardian of ner daughter it was
her duty to accompany her back to
Japan.

Within the past few days three promi
nent members of the California Promotion
Committee have tendered their resigna
tions to the associations that appointed
them to ' serve on the committee. These
are W. H. .Mills and Arthur R, Briggs,
who were appointed by the State Board
of Trade, and Charles Bundschu, who
represented the Merchants' Association
in the promotion committee. Mr. Mills
said that the reason for his with
drawal was personal. Mr. Bundschu
admitted that friction had something to
do with his resignation, but that pressing
business of his , own was more of a
factor. /
The finance committee of the promotion
committee consisted of three members.
Two of the members were Bundschu,
who was the chairman, and Briggs. For
some time it has been noised about that
there has been a great deal of friction
in the promotion committee. Recently
the situation, within , the offices became
somewhat acute. Rtffus P. Jennings, the
executive officer, and Mr. Hess, the secre
tary, had words.
The friction to which Mr. Bundschu al
luded to in his case probably had to do
with a recent interview with Mr. Jen
nings. Mr. Bundschu had communicated
with Mr. Hess, who is the secretary of
the committee. Mr. Jennings considered
that Mr. Bundschu should have brought
the matter to him first as the executive
officer. Mr. Bundschu resented any dic
tation. His resignation is in the hands of
President Symmes of the Merchants', As
sociation. , He. has ..served seventeen
months gratuitously.
Quite recently the finance committee
sought the services of an expert to have
a report macte concerning the. expendi
tures of the moneys that had been re
ceived. Mr. Bundschu declares that no
irregularities were discovered. The epi
sode occasioned ! interest on the part of
the members of the executive committee,
who have the general supervision of af
fairs.
Some criticism has been made bymem
bers of the committee concerning the
use to which the money contributed
by merchants has been devoted. The
fixed monthly expense of maintaining the
headquarters on New Montgomery street
is stated to be about $1300. The rent takes
up $150 of this and postage and current
expenses $450 more. The remainder of the
$1300 is reported to be expended for
salaries, which amounts to about 5700 per
month in round figures.
The committee printed the speeches of
President Roosevelt In California at a
cost of about $5000. It hasv^also issued
publications costing various sums. Some
of the books have been sold and some re
main on hand. The sum of something
like $7000 was expended for advertising
California in Eastern publications. Such
publication has been discontinued for
some months. Several thousand dollars
have been contributed by the committee
to organizations representing the interior
counties of the State to help them in
making their resources known to the
world.
No appointments have yet been made
by the State Board of Trade or the Mer
chants' Association to fill the vacancies
occasioned by the resignations of. Messrs.
Bundschu, Briggs and Mills.
Joins Theatrical Company.
Eva.Cournler, the young girl who was
arrested on 'complaint of her father be
cause she was working in a dance hall
at -406 Dupont street, told Police Judge
Fritz yesterday that she had procured
an enffagement In a theatrical company
and would no longer be seen at the dance
hall. On that understanding the , T udge
allowed her to go.
In- all cases where the writs of habeas
corpus have been sought the applica
tions were for Chinese denied landing
by the Chinese Bureau. The invariable
custom of the few white attorneys who
appeared in the cases was to Â¦ secure the
writ on the ground that the applicant
was a native born American and illegally
deprived of his liberty by the^tgents of
the steamship companies.
The- same evidence would be presented
in every case, so-called "fathers" and
"uncles" being produced to testify that
the applicant for admission was born in
From January 1, 1900, up to the present
time the number of applications of
Chinese for writs of habeas corpus
amounted to 815, of which number 314
failed to gain admission to this country.
ABE PAI.PABLE FEATOS.
In 1898 the number of Chinese denied
landing by the Chinese Bureau and who
sought writs of habeas corpus reached
the total of 271 and the courts ordered
ninety-five of this number deported.
In 1899 the applications for writs ; of
habeas corpus were 136 and of this num
ber sixty-three were remanded for de
portation to China.
In 1S97 thirty-eight native born Ameri
cans sought the relief of the writ of
habeas corpus and sixteen failed to gain
admission to America and were ordered
deported.
In 1896 there were thirty-five applica
tions of alleged ..native bprn Americans
and three were denied admission to tbls
country. j
The records of , the United States Dis
trict Court show that there has been a
large increase in recent years in the num
ber of applications for writs of habeas
corpus for Chinese denied landing by the
Chinese Bureau. Since January 1, 1890, up
to date, the number of applications for
writs of habeas corpus amount to 1395.
All of these applications were made on
the ground that the Chinese denied land
ing were native born Americans. Of the
number of cases mentioned and passed
upon by the Federal courts 491 were
ordered deported and 904 were given per
mission to land.
An air of mystery pervaded the Federal
building yesterday and neither United
States District Attorney Woodworth nor
United States Marshal Shine was willing
to vouchsafe any information. The two
officials contended that all the white men
implicated in the fraud had been discov
ered and that it might be possible that
some Chinese might be arrested for being
implicated in the substitution of old
Chinese for young ones.
Secret Service Agent Burns is not con
sulting Woodworth or Shine as. to his
next" move. â¢ The Government sleuth is
quietly going about his work and for that
reason an air of uncertainty exists in the
Federal building.
APPLICATIONS INCREASE.

Secret Service Agent William J. Burns
Is working and the possibility of arrests
of Federal officials and others '-in connec

pected to take place at any time.
Those who are conversant with the
methods employed by the Chinese to se
cure the Illegal landing of their country
men ridicule the statements that only four
white men were implicated in the sub
stitution of Chinese ordered deported, the
expose of which led to the arrest of
Deputy Sheriffs Burnett, Dasha and
Dempsey and the suicide of Deputy
