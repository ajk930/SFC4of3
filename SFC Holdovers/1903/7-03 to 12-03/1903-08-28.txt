"There Is, however, a corps of force re
quired In our army that could be ren
dered of great utility, not only to the
military., but to the people of this coun
try. This power is being recognized by
European Governments, and I have sev
eral times recommended it to ours. It
will be utilized In the next war and prep
aration for Its use by our army should
no longer be neglected. I have reference
to the bicycle, aiotor cycle and the auto
mobile, which they have developed to the
extent that they have become a most
valuable means of communication and
transportation. Five regiments of cav
alry should be discontinued and a corps
of five regiments should be organized,
thoroughly trained and constantly em
ployed In the use of these modern appli
ances.
"The modern appliances of road build
ing are vastly superior to those formerly
usedâ in fact, the work is now done prin
cipally by machineryâ ar.d . this corps
should be supplied with all the recent in
ventions and improvement* for that pur
pose.
"The millions of dollars that are now
uselessly expended for one-third of the
mounted force could In this way be util
ized in bringing about t great improve

efit upon the country, at the same time
training a most Important corps for mili

be recommended to and authorized by
Cor-sreB*."
"The marvelous development in modern
arms â rifles, machine guns and qulck

as formerly used on the battlefield, obso
lete, while the wonderful development In
the use of motor power and electrical ap
pliances has rendered the horse far less
important than formerly. These facts are
doubly significant and should be recog
r.ized by the military authorities and the
Government.
"It is safe to say that there are tens
of thousands of men In our country who
are in the saddle every day who are killed
In landcraft and use of arms and who can
be easily converted into a most formid
able corps of mounted riflemen. In fact,
there could easily be mobilized in our
country at least ten times as many
mounted men, many of whom have had
military sen-ice, as could be landed ;'on
our shores by any government or gov
ernments within any reasonable time. We
have 100,000 men accustomed to the saddle
and rifle that could be used to quickly
overrun either Canada or Mexico. Hence
the disproportion of our mounted forces
to that of the main body of the array is
unnecessary and Injudicious.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 27.-Edlth White,
former wife of John A. White, general
agent for the International Harvester
Company,* died of starvation In the Klon
dike country and her body has probably
been devoured by wild beasts.
Such is the information contained in a
special dispatch from Seattle, which gives
details of th& finding of the unfortunate
woman's diary, containing a history of
her life from the time she left her former
home in Mankato, Minn., until she died
of exposure and lack of food in the heart
of the trackless Copper River country.
Mrs. White was a graduate of the Den
tal School of the State University and
was practicing dentistry in Dawson City
two years, ago. She wrote to her relatives
here saying she was going Into the in
terior and probably would not be heard
of for some time.
In a letter written from Central Alaska
July 29. William Shafer, a petty officer in
the employ of the Government Signal
Corps, related the story of the finding of
letters and a diary tending to show that
Mrs. White perished from cold and hunger
under circumstances most pitiable.
. While trying to make her way unaccom
panied to an interior camp in the Copper
River country, Mrs. White says in the
diary, that she was lost in the moun
tains for days. She wandered through
canyons in a vain endeavor to find some
human habitation. Twice she had narrow
escapes from wild beasts, once sha
escaped from vicious mountains lions by
wading into p. small lake up to her neck,
where she stood in the icy water, while
the ravenous beasts crouched on the edge
of the lake.
More dead than alive/ Mrs. White,
emerged from the water and lay down
exhausted. With her remaining energy
she scribbled with indelible pencil let*
ters and the diary which recorded her
wanderings and sufferings up to the- time
that hunger had deprived her of strength
to write.
Shafer took possession pt these letters
and the diary and also made a diligent
search for the body. This he did not find,
but forwarded copies of the letters and
the diary to the address given, that in
this manner White might be informed of
his wife's death..

This accident is of value In ' showing
that Alpine Climbing Is dangerous at all
times and all places, with guides or with
out guides. This very same slope has
been crossed almost dally for twenty-flve
years. . . â¢ .
The g-ujde.-who was caught by huge Ice
blocks and pinned in up to his neck, was
hacked out after one hour's hard work
by George Sossang, a Pontrejina guide.
Jt is feared. Schlegel is fnjured internally,
as one of the ice blocks smashed in his
ribs. Mainzer is hardly, the worse for,, his
remarkable venture. ',
This group heard an ominous crackling
behind them and turned and missed the
two men immediately. They, expected to
find Mainzer and the- guide at the bottom
of this cavern, but on lowering them
relves by ropes they found Mainzer prac
tically unharmed on the snow.
Herbert K. Mainzer. an experienced
young American Alpinist, left the
Tscheriva Hut with a guide named Schle
f;el at 4 o'clock this morning to ascend
Morteratsch Mountain, which he had done
almost daily. Twenty minutes below the
summit while ascending the well-known
"teepest ice elope and while in the middle
Ihe center suddenly caved in, forming a
crevasse more than 150 feet in depth.
Both men were dashed to the bottom,
with masses of ice towering above them.
Both the guide and tourist lost conscious
ness. By sheer good luck they had been
preceded fifteen minutes by another party
with two guides.

Special Dispatch to The Call
The next race, which will be like the
one attempted to-day, fifteen miles to
leeward or windward and return", will be
sailed on Saturday. Â¦'Â¦Â¦; /-..*?'
Even in the light air it was astonishing
how the defender slipped through the
placid seas. With the gentle breeze dis
tending the surface of her pure white
sails and her stern crowded -with bars
to hold her head up, she moved along
as serenely and peacefully as if In a
dreamless sleep, yet the gap between her
and the challenger steadily widened un
til two mile3 separated them. Half an
hour from home, when the spectators
had abandoned any idea that the fjnish
line could be reached In time, the 'wind
suddenly freshened and the Reliance
came bowling down at a merry clip. But
the wind had come too late, and when
still a few hundred yards from home the
gun on the tug Navigator boomed across
the water.* The excursion boats held on
until she crossed the line, to give her a
reusing welcome, and then scampered for
New York. Sir Thomas, who heretofore
has always followed his champion into
the Hook, sent his steam yacht Erin
ahead at full speed, as if to drown out
the memory of the Inglorious defeat he
received to-day.
After rounding the float for the. run
home and setting big ballooners, the
wind, which had strengthened to six or
seven knots on the beat, died down, and
the towering clouds of canvas drifted
lazily down an ocean lane a mile wide
between the two divisions of the excur
sion fleet-
Fuliy as discouraging: as the sailing
qualities displayed by the challenger was
the manner in which she was handled.
The Yankee skipper not only outmaneuv
ered his rival in the spectacular battle
for position at the start, as he has done
every time they have met, but, worse still
for the down-hearted supporter of the
Shamrock, Captain Wringe repeated his
blunder of Tuesday. He crossed the line
in the wake of the Reliance with a handi
cap of sixty-one of the precious seconds
for which Designer Fife had sacrificed
so much in sail spread for time allowance.
Both boats, it is true, went over after
the smoke of the handicap gun, but where
both are handicapped it is only the stern
most craft which actually suffered.
It was not a pleasant day on the water
and the observation fleet which put out
to sea to witness the race was hardly
more than half as large as on the pre
ceding days. There was a chill in the
atmosphere. 'Low, Â¦ wet - clouds shut out
the sky., and the mist wreaths on the sea
made everything look ghostlike and in
distinct. . The , dark .water of tbe-ccean
was 'aa smooth as a floor and a slight
breeze of about four, knots blew out of
the southwest. The course was laid
fifteen miles dead into the wind and
return.
At the end of the first hour Shamrock
was beaten and the interest waned.
THE WIND FAILS.
The Reliance beat the Shamrock hope
leesly in the fifteen miles of windward
work, rounding the outer mark twelve
minutes and thirty seconds ahead of her,
a gain in actual time of seventeen min
utes twenty-nine seconds, and down the
wind she steadily increased her lead. The
real race of the day was not against the
Shamrock, but was In the exciting strug
gle of the Reliance in the last half hour
to reach the finish line before the regatta
committee fired the gun which should an
nounce the expiration of the time limit.
Had the wind freshened twenty minutes
sooner than it d'd the cup series would
have ended to-day with three straight
wins for the defender and the Shamrock
would have sailed back to England one
of the most worsted challengers in the
history of the America's cup contests
BATTLE FOE POSITION.
Although officially it was no race, the
defeat administered to the challenger was
so ignorainous that whatever lingering
hope remaining in the breast of the
friends of the Shamrock III vanished.
The Reliance's victory was in every way
more decisive than that of last Saturday.
The Shamrock was outsailed, outpointed
and outfooted from start to finish.

LIVES LOST
IN A FLOOD
IN STREETS
COUNCIL BLUFFS, la., Aug. 27.â The
Missouri River valley, from Missouri Val
ley, twenty miles north, to Pacific Junc
tion, fifteen miles south of here, is al
most a lake for the entire distance, and
of the five trunk lines running east from
here, only one, the Illinois Central, is
able to get a train in or out of the city.
Two persons, H. H. Larue of Coming
and "A. R. Fash of Clinton, a horseman,
lost their lives while attempting to res
cue a number of persons from the fair
grounds, which were suddenly flooded.
Larue was electrocuted while pushing a
boat under an electric light wire and
Fash was drowned. Three others are
missing and are thought to have lost
their lives on the flooded fair grounds.
The flood was caused by a sudden rise
in the Nodaway River to-day, which sub
merged the grounds before those having
charge of exhibits knew of their danger,
part of them being asleep. The water
reached a depth of twenty-one- feet on
the grounds and Washed away a number
of buildings.
The railroads are the heaviest sufferers
from the flood. The Burlington exist and
south has half a dozen bad washouts and
their track is under water at a number
of other points. Their bridge at Malvern
was washed out entirely and traffic is
badly blocked. The Wabash road, which
runs south, has several washouts.
The Northwestern tracks between this
city and Missouri Valley are nearly all
under water and no trains have been run
over them to-day. The Rock Island Rail
road has been unable to get trains far
ther west than Atlantic and the Milwau
kee is blocked at Neola.
KANSAS CITY. Mo., Aug. 2T.â Unpr#Â«
cedentedly heavy rains north ani west of
Kansas City have caused the Kansas and
Missouri rivers to rise suddenlj to un
usual heights and the result hire may
prove grave. A bulletin issued to-day by
the local "Weather Bureau announced that
the Kansas or Kaw River would rlsa
from five to seven feet at Kansas City
in the next forty-eight hours, and a rise
of eaual magnitude, it is said. Is coming
this, way down the Missouri. . The- fact
that the Missouri will rise also is caus
ing anxiety, as it is tjelieved It will re
tard the flow of the Kansas River at the
mouth of the latter stream and endan
ger the temporary bridges, as well aa the
railway yards and heavy business in the
west bottoms. Two temporary pile
bridges were carried out by last week's
rise and others were damaged, and it is
feared that the expected rise may carry
oi?t more of them. The current is swift
and it carries much driftwood. If tho
bridges go out it would cripple the traffic
of the big packing houses and other es
tablishments across the Kansas line from
here and cut off communication between
the two Kansas Cltys.
The Kansas River here to-day rose three
feet in ten hours and is still rising rap
idly. At Lawrence this stream rose four
feet during the night, and at Topeka It
is also ud about four feet.
RIVEH BREAKS BAJJKS.
At Manhattan, where the Big Blue emp
ties into the Kansas, the latter stream
has risen seven feet In the last twelve
hours. At that point the Blue has broken
from its banks and Is cutting across the
country, taking a short course to the
Kansas River. Many farms are deep un
der water. At Stockdale, eight mllea
north of Manhattan, the Blue is slightly
higher than during the great June flood.
Farmers continue to move their stock
and household effects to higher places.
Several small washouts are reported on
the Union Pacific east of Manhattan.
A seven-foot rise in the rivers at Kan
sas City may be the climax of the pres
ent high water, but the conditions favor
more rain in this section.
TOPEKA, Kans., Aug. 27.â The Kansas
River at this place is slowly rising. On
account of the heavy rains a rise of five
to seven feet is expected by morning.
At Manhattan the Blue River is to
night sixteen and a half feet above the
low water mark. The river is overflow
ing its banks and hundreds of acrea of
growing crops are ruined and farmers are
being driven from their homes. The Union
Pacific and Blue Valley tracks are under
water and cannot be used to-night.
LATE CROPS ASSURED.
GUTHRIE, O. T.. Aug. 27.â A general
rain fell over Eastern Oklahoma to-day

BERLIN, Aug. 27.â Dr. Schwartz, man
ager of the State Hospital at Muehl
hausen, Alsace-Lorraine, killed Dr.
Schloss, who was the leader of a strike
movement on the part of outdoor relief
physicians at Muehlhausen, in a duel, two
or three days ago. The survivor and the
seconds apparently tried to conceal the
cause of Dr. Schloss' death, attributing
it to blood poisoning, according to one re
port. The police took possession of the
body as it was about to be cremated at
Gothand and ordered the arrest of Dr.
Schwartz for murder.
The duel was the result of a controversy
lasting for months between the manage

At 1:02, .when the turning . mark was
rising above the horizon, five miles away,

had been won- at 12:20, when the red
lightship was not .more than five miles
alee and the Reliance three-quarters of a
mile dead to windward and persistently
outpointing Sir Thomas 1 forlorn hope.
Ten minutes later, when about ilx miles
of the course had been covered, the.Re
liance, tacked, hut, as the Shamrock kept
on, promptly went about again. Then the
Shamrock .went, about and the Reliance
followed. Ba.rr was i unwilling . to split
tacks, as : he had ' the Shamrock beaten

was. ' . Â¦ â¢ >;
of his time allowance. The Reliance was
leading by about 300 yards. Once, across
the line, they held the port tack a few
minutes and then went about headed
eastward. The Reliance was a good bit
up to windward and hanging on to her
windward position, while the Shamrock
tried to make up for it by footing the
faster; but the next tack, twenty-five
minutes after the start, when Shamrock
had lost ground and as they lay about
the same course, was a quarter of a mile
astern of the American craft. .
The boats were heeling gently, stepping
along at a remarkable pace,, considering
how light the air was, and foot by foot
the Reliance was working away from her
rival.
TIME ALLOWANCE LOST. :
Captain Wringe had lost the best part
ing skipper in Great Britain at
getting his boat over the starting line,
was defeated to-day. The preliminary
Jockeying and start was the prettiest ex
hibition of skill and seamanship In the
series. It was a contest for the wind
ward position. Only once did Cap lain
Barr lose it, and then ha promptly re
gaineu it. For fifteen minutes preceding
the start he held the British boat tucked
neatly under the lee wing of the defender,
despite Captain "Wringe's best efforts â¢ t<5
clear his boat, and when It was over and
the boats clipped across fhe line Barr
held a splendid victory to his credit.
The wind, which was from the south
east and blowing at four knots, was Just
dimpling the smooth sea when the com
mittee tug flew the course Bignal Indicat
ing a fifteen-mile beat to windward and
run home. "When the preparatory -gun
sounded at 10:45 a. m. the racers were
sailing parallel to the starting line and
to windward of it with the Reliance to
windward, where Barr wanted her. At
the. end of the line the Shamrock III
luffed and tried to force Barr about, but
the Yankee would not yield and Wringe
had to give up and fill away again. They
crossed the opposite end of the line out
side of the line, the Shamrock III drop
ping back and luffing to windward of the
Reliance on the way. That was the only
time Barr was caught jto leeward. Luf
fing hard, he sailed a circle around the
challenger, blanketed her as the starting
gun sounded, bore off around the ntern
of the lightship and luffed across the line
with 'a - handicap of forty-one seconds.
The Shamrock followed, handicapped by
one [ minute and forty-one seconds, 1 one
minute and one second of which was dead
loss. The official starting time for both
boats was 11:02, but the actual start as
timed by the regatta committee was as
follows:

' Meantime Shamrock III had caught a
freshening southwest breeze, taken in her
spinnaker and was reaching for the line
at' a better clip than at any. time dur
ing the race, but when the finish^ gun
was fired she , began to take in sail and
before she reached the lightship was car
rying nothing but a balloon Jib topsail.
She did not cross the finish line.
The wind freshened a bit as she neared
the line. She was still a quarter of a
mile distant from the line when the navi
gator gave notice that the race was off.
The Reliance kept on and crossed at
4:38:13, six minutes and forty-five seconds
behind the time limit.
It was evident that the yachts were
covering about five miles an hour. They
had been approximately three' hours In
beating fifteen miles, and unless the wind
should freshen there was small prospect
of their covering the fifteen miles home
in the hour and a half remaining. Once
heading homeward balloon Jib topsails
were broken out and spinnakers set to
port on both boats. They dawdled along
in exasperating fashion, while an hour
slipped away. Not a change took place
on either of the yachts nor did the result
seem to be" any relative difference In their
positions.
The Reliance was losing her race against
time, and at 4 p. rn. had little hope of
getting across the line at 4:32, when the
time limit of- five and a half hours would
expire. She was six miles from the finish
when her sails fell aslant of wind from
southwest, her spinnaker was smothered
and she laid a reach homeward. .Hope
revived only to be dashed. Five minutes
afterward when the wind again backed

This first order did not say
what emergency caused it or

the European squadron, of which
the Brooklyn is the flagship, about
six days to run from Nice to Bei

Mr. Loomis at once sent a copy

a prompt investigation of the
crime, the arrest and punishment
of the guilty, and to advise the

Mr. Magelssen, who was about
30 years old, a brother-in-law, of
Mr. Ravndal, was appointed Vice
Consul at Beirut on September 20,
1899, prior to which time he had

was of Scandinavian descent,
born in 1873 at Bratsburg, Fill

son of a Lutheran minister. He
was a student at' the Lutheran
College at Decorah, Iowa, for
three years. For a time he was
assistant City Assessor of Sioux
Falls, S. D., and was also asso
ciate editor, of a paper called the
Echo, published there.
He was a man of more than
usual intelligence, with a record
clear of any personal or official
trouble which might be construed
as a cause for any one to seek his

Orient, a German missionary paper pub
lished In Berlin, prints correspondence
from Teheran alleging that the leaders
of the Persian Mohammedan Church have
served notice on the Shah that unites he
purges the country of foreign religious
and commercial influences, especially
British and Russian, the church will pre
cipitate a revolution.
The church leaders also demand that
the Shah restore the religious and eco
nomic conditions which prevailed in Per
sia a century ago. The correspondent
says the anti-foreign movement is not
directed against the Germans, because the
natives are convinced that Germany has
no political Intentions and they consider
Turko-German friendship <o be a fore
runner of good feeling toward Germany
throughout the Mohammedan world.
Movement Is DirectedjAgainst
British and Russian
Influences.
President Roosevelt is concerned over
the situation as it is developed to-day,
because It indicates an Intolerable condi
tion of affairs In Turkey. He recalls the
fact that only recently. a Russian Consul
was murdered in Turkey.
The European squadron Is so situated
that it will require several days for it to
rendezvous at Beirut. Meantime the offi
cials of the State Department will be fully
advised by Minister Leishman of the de
tails of the crime and the President will
then be in a position to present to Turkey
the demands of the United States with a
naval force on the Â¦ spot of sufficient
strength to enforce them adequately.
A demand that officials of the United
States be afforded protection for their
lives and property will be made; and the
Turkish Government will dÂ« held respon

Consul, whatever may be the circum

CAN GET NO JUSTICE.
Justice Pitcher thereupon dismissed all
of the would-be jurymen and assigned the
case ta San Mateo Township for trial.
"We can get no justice here," he stated.
"This thing has happened before, and I
wash my hands of the whole matter. I
shall consult the District Attorney of the
county with a view to bringing impeach
ment proceedings against the accused
constable and shall endeavor to have him
removed from office should the charges
be proved true."
The charge ia made that Vallejo has
been in the habit of protecting friends of
the Supervisor who is the political boss in
this section, notwithstanding : the senti
ment against him. A few weeks ago John
J. Higglns, a supporter of the Supervisor,
assaulted John Keough while the latter
was seated in a chair. Although the de
fendant admitted his guilt, the jury re
turned a verdict of "not guilty," which
greatly displeased Justice Pitcher in the
face of the evidence, but which was al
lowed to stand, as .the Judge considered
that Vallejo would again summons the
same character of men.
Many other charges are likely to be
brought against .certain officials. It Is
said that for years principals and teach
ers in - schools have been - paying . money
that tjiey might retain their positions, and
this. may be investigated when the time
comes. The hearing to-morrow in San
Mateo will be of a nature to remove the
constable 'and to ascertain the guilt of
Smith in the battery case. A number of
representative citizens as well as wit
nesses will be on hand when the " court
convenes, and the proceedings promise to
be lively.
That there will be merry times in the
Democratic municipal convention next

MEEBY TIMES COMING.
The Registrar holds: "Any name writ
ten upon a ballot shall be counted for the
office under which it Is written,, provided
It is written in the 'blank column.'
"If a voter marks more names than
there are persons to be elected to an of
fice (as, for instance, a ballot whereon
nineteen or more Supervisors, or three or
more Police Judges, have been voted for),
or if for any reason It is impossible to
determine the voter's choice for any "of
fice to be filled, his ballot shall not be
counted for such office, but the balance of
the ticket should be counted.
"If a voter stamps in the circle at the
head of one' of the party columns and
also stamps in the voting square after
the name of any candidate in the same
or any other column, or writes the. name
of a person for such office in the blank
column, such act does not invalidate his
ballot, but his vote must be counted for
the candidate opposite whose name the
cross is made, or for the person whose
name is so written in the blank column,
and as to the other officers the ballot
must be counted as a straight party vote
for the candidates for the office under the
circle stamped."
The new style of ballot was adopted at
the last session of the Legislature. The
politicians of the two leading parties rec
ommended it. The first practical test of
its workings in San Francisco will be
made at the municipal ejection on Tues
day", November 3.
In regard to a candidate whose name
appears twice on the ballot, the Regis
trar rules: "If the name of the same
person Is printed more than once on a
ballot, as a candidate for the same office,
the placing ota cross opposite such name
in more than one of the different places,
where It is so printed, must not be re
garded as a distinguishing mark on the
ballot, and must be counted only* as one
vote for euch person."
AS TO WRITTEN NAMES.
the chances of error, should place the
cross opposite the name of every candi
date that he votes for. Surely the utmost
care should be taken in voting for Super
visors, provided the voter has made up
his mind to vote for some nominees of the
party to which he does not belong. If
the voter Etamps for one Supervisor he
should stamp for every other Supervisor
that he desires to vote for.
It is* obvious that the greatest danger
of confusion will arise in the voting for
Supervisors. The Registrar's exhibit No.
S in the pamphlet of special instructions
Knows a cross within the circle at the
head of the Republican column and also
a cross opposite the names of nine Super
visors in the Democratic column. The
Registrar rules that the ballot shall be
thus counted: "The voter having placed
a cross In his party circle and also nine
crosses in another party column for Su
pervisors, and having failed to place
crosses opposite the Supervisors In his
party .^column. It is Impossible to ascer
tain which nine Supervisors he intended
to vote for in his party column, if any;
therefore, in canvaesing this ballot it
must be counted, as, to Supervisors, in
favor of those opposite whose names he
etamps a cross and no others. The same
applies to Police Judges."
The ballots illustrated In The Call to
day are reproduced to show the style of
the new form. As one studies, the law
and the ballot the impression grows

DANGEB OF CONFUSION.
the average voter, in order to
avoid mistakes, must give close attention
to the Instructions of the Registrar. There
is plain Bailing so long as the elector
restricts his choice to the nominees of
his own party, but when he elects to
vote for a Supervisor or Police Judge in
the column of another party the danger
of confusion begins. Registrar Walsh has
issued special instructions to election offi
cers. He has given thirteen examples to
show the manner in which the ordinary
ballot may be voted and how it shall be
counted. Ballo^ No. 1 in the Registrar's
ltst shows a cross inside the circle at
the head of the Republican ticket. There
Is no other mark in the ballot, and there
fore every candidate in the Republican
column is voted for. Ballot No. 2 of the
Registrar's exhibit shows a similar cross
inside the circle at the head of the Demo
cratic ticket, and this signifies that every
Democratic candidate in the column is
voted for. Example No. 3 shows a cross
ia ; the circle at the top and a cross op
posite every name in the column. This
alto is a straight ballot.
Exhibit No. 5 of the Registrar's special
instructions show a cro^s within the cir
cle at the top of the Reaublican ballot
and a. cross opposite the names of all
the candidates but two. The Registrar
holds that this must be counted as a
straight ballot, adding this note:
"Noteâ Special attention is called to bal
lot No. .5. You will note that the voter
has failed to place a cross opposite two
candidates in his party column, and no
stamp appearing in any other column he
nevertheless has placed a cross in the
circle at the head of his party column;
therefore it roust be considered that he
intended lo vote a straight party ticket,
and it must be counted as such."
THE new ballot law of California,
approved March 14 t 1Â»3, may be
very clear to the members of the
Legislature who framed it, but

lican circles that it .would be a mistake

The convention will probably be held the
latter part of next week..
j If McNab attempts to throw Byington
down and name Supervisor Brandenstein,
who i.s said to be looking for the nomina
tion, there will be a hot fight on the floor
of the convention. Byington Is promised
support from all Bides, and he will get it
if it comes to an open light. '
At present there -are five candidates in
the field for nomination as Police Judges.
Judges Slogan and Cabanlss seem to have
a lead in the fight and it is probable they
will be nominated. Charlie ; Weller, who
is a close friend of McNab, counts on one
of the places. Archie Campbell, the popu
lar young attorney, has been given assur
ances that if he can show that he will
win at the coming electio^ he will be
considered.' Edward F. Shottall, a promi
nent member of the Olympic and South
End Rowing clubs; is also in the field and
has hopes.
All candidates on the Democratic ticket
look with ponging eyes toward; the : Union

that the Labor party will indorse the
nominees of the Democratic convention
and thus aid them to defeat the Repub

HOT FIGHT EXPECTED.
It is almost a certainty that Lewis F.
Byington will secure the nomination for
District Attorney. McNab would rather
give up another office to the opposition

tees are named. There is some talk of the
Horse and Carts putting up Joseph. E.

loomed up on the political horizon as yet.
The side that gets the chairman will have

The "works" in this instance will be the

1 NEW BALLOT ADOPTED BY LAST LEGISLATURE WHICH -WILL BE USED IN THIS CITY AT THE COMING
MUNICIPAL ELECTION AND WHICH HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS FOR THE
PURPOSE OF INSTRUCTING CITIZENS. ' .
FRIENDS of Ernest Has
tings, the actor, were
startled by the report that
he' had gone insane in
New York and was raving
Wednesday night over the
fancied imprisonment in a par
lor car of the girl whom he
madly loved and â¢ whom he
called "Madge Cummings."
Last evening Hastings was at
the Lambs' Club, calm and se
rene. Associates there say it
was nothing, more serious than
indiscreet indulgence in drink.
Miss Madge Chapman of San
Jose says she hopes she is the
girl about whom Hastings
raved."
Last Tuesday the case was called.
Nearly all of. the two venires were present
and Attorney James O'Keefe of Redwood
City, who conducted the prosecution, told
When Vallejo returned from his work on
the evening that Gianocca summoned the
jury he asked, the deputy to permit him
to scan the list. According to the testi
mony given by the deputy in '. court the
constable is said to have been enraged at
the personnel of the venire. "We don't
want these men." he said, "they will con
vict Smith, and we want him to be ac
quitted. I would rather give $20 than to
see this man punished." Vallejo then de
manded the. list from Gianocca and said
he would subi>ena another | venire. ' : Gia
nocca denounced the transaction as In
famous and, tossing his star to hla su
perior," tendered his resignation.
"Yes, I know Mr. Hastings," said Miss
Chapman. "He was a dear friend of
mine. I've heard about him being In
sane, but that was caused by financial
and theatrical troubles. He was a great
friend of my father and In that way I
met him. The Belascos had promised to
furnish him money to go East on, but
finally backed out. He had trouble, and
that Is what bothered him. The last
time I saw him he was perfectly -sane
and in good spirits." ...
She would not admit in the presence of
others that she. was the girl whom Hast
ings had been hunting In the railroad
yards, and whom the actor declared they
were killing. As the reporter turned to
leave she followed him to the door, and
outside said: . V â¢

lovers. I love him and hope he will be

gar, farmer; M. Costa, farmer, and Joe
Rue, blacksmith.
While Gianocca was securing a jury
Constable Fred Vallejo was busy feed
ing at the public trough. He holds three
positions, for which the county pays him
salary; and he is working as a laborer,
building a county bridge. Vallejo has re
ceived favors at the hands of Debenedetti
and is regarded as one of the latter'a
strongest henchmen. He was appointed
a school trustee, then constable, and one
month ago the Supervisor caused him to
be appointed inspector of a cement bridge
which was i being built in the neighbor
hood of Halfmoon Bay.
The bridge is being built by contractors,
and very soon after Vallejo took his posi
tion as inspector at $2 50 per day he ac
cepted a job from the contractors and is
being paid a similar amount. This queer
condition of affairs in which a man can
do duty by the county as a critic on a
piece of work which he himself Is per
forming puzzles the taxpayers who are
putting up his salaries.
When Interviewed to-night she was
busy telling a gentleman's fortune with
cards. About the room was half a dozen
pictures of Hastings. Miss Chapman is
tho daughter of W. Larige Chapman^ a
former resident of Portland, Or. At pres
ent she resides with her grandmother,
Mrs. S. E. Floed.
Friends of Hastings say that the report
of last night's ravings was greatly exag
gerated. .They say there was no touch
of insanity and that his erratic conduct
was due to overindulgence in drink.
Peter Daley, actor, a San Franciscan,
well acquainted with Hastings, said to
night:
"If he is crazy he certainly knows how
to conceal it. He was in here to-night
(Lambs' Club) and was the sanest crazy
man I ever talked with. There was noth
ing whatever unusual in his condition,
mentally or physically."
SAN JOSE, Aug. 27.â Miss Madge Chap
man, who admits she is the cause of the
hallucinations of Ernest Hastings in New
York, is residing with her grandmother
at 145 North Fifth street. She Is a stately
and stylish blonde and would attract at
tention anywhere; in fact, she is one of
the prettiest girls in San Jose.
Francisco, was the idol of the
matinee girls, was at the Lambs' Club
early this evening apparently as well as
ever and in his right mind. Whatever
hallucinations he may have had last night
of the imprisonment of the girl he loved,
"Madge Cummings," In a parlor car, had
disappeared and he seemed distinctly a
man without delusions.

friends would have wished.

WARRANT FOR SMITH.
In some manner which has yet to be
explained the board of directors, with the
exception of j Smith, was composed of
residents of San Francisco, and Immedi
ately a roar of dissension started in the
harbor territory and many of the prin
cipal subscribers announced their inten
tion of withdrawing their names from the
list, especially when it was learned that
Smith was' to be awarded 11,000 shares of
stock for his services in bringing about
the Incorporation.
The wave of dissent apparently did not
worry the directors except that they re
considered their decision to' award Smith
the stock. The latter la particularly
friendly to Debenedetti and the move was
supposed to be one that would result in
throwing the control of the company into
the "hands of the Supervisor. Threats
were- then made to sue the subscribers for
the amounts they had set opposite their
.names and this affair is yet unsettled.-
While the company was in its incip
iency some tHsagreement arose' between
Smith and Miguil. The conversation was
regarding, the attitude of the Supervisor
and Smith is said to have told Miguil
that ho could "swing Debenedetti around
his little finger" and handle him as he
liked. This remark Migrull repeated to
the Supervisor, ' and Smith, when ques
tioned about It, â¢ denounced Miguil as a
liar. Debenedetti then schemed to bring
the two men together. On August 9 he
called Miguil into his store, which was
apparently without any other occupant.
After a casual conversation the visitor,
in answer to a auestion, repeated what
he said Smith had told him. â¢ Smith then
came from his place of concealment and
after a few words beat his accuser se
verely.
SUBSCRIBEBS DISSATISFIED,
Accordingly G: Sidney Smith, son of Dr.
Smith, was.-"chosen to" advance : the In
terests of .the company and to solicit sub
scriptions.' The number of shares was
limited to 25,000,' at a par value of $L -
Nearly every, business man in the Half-
Moon' Bay 'district placeq his name on
the list and some ' agreed" to take 100Q
shares of stock. This was before the
Incorporation of the company, which
matter was left to Miguil and Smith.
About three weeks ago the business was
fixed ud in San Francisco.
The recent trouble arose out of an as
sault made by G. Sidney Smith upon Jo
seph Miguil, a rancher. The difficulty
grew out of an effort to incorporate a
company for ' the 'purpose of building a
wharf in the harbor. The farmers have
frequently 'complained of the tyranny of
the present company doing business in
the little port and concluded to establish
a means of exportation on their own ac
count. Joseph Miguil was a leader in the
scheme. Supervisor Joseph Debenedetti,
who holds sway in the district by reason
of his position, is said to have sought an
important place in the company, but,
many of the citizens expressed their dis
favor of the man and said they would
refuse to become a party to any transac
tion, in which" he figured as an important
factor.
DEBENEDETTI HOLDS SWAY.
In the San Mateo "Township the case
of thft People. vs. G. Sidney Smith will
come up to-morrow morning before Jus
tice W.O. Boothe. Justice John Pitcher
of the Half Moon Bay Township ordered
the transfer of tho case from his court
and sensations may develop. A Consta
ble will be accused of having favored the
defendant to such an extent that he al
tered a venire of jurors already drawn,
and stated as a reason for so doing that
he. desired men who would vote for ac
quittal. t A deputy Constable, who pro
tested against so apparently a flagrant
violation of the law, has tendered his res
ignation, and impeachment proceedings
against the Consf.ab.ie will be brought.
Justice Pitcher, Iii ridding himself of
the case, stated in open court that he has
been handicapped continually by "fixed"
Juries and that, it has become utterly im
possible to convict the guilty, though
they admit their guilt, when certain pol
iticians reach out to save them.
HALF MOON BAY, Aug. 27.â Scandal
of a far-reaching order has cast a
Bhadow over the Half Moon Bay district,
In San Mateo County. The little section
has been pronounced a "rotten borough";
the judiciary expresses inability to dis
pense Justice and has turned Its affairs
over to another township. A gigantic
political influence is held responsible fbr
the diswrought condition. The ' hands of
one man seem to clasp the reins of power
In such a manner as to bring dismay to
leading citizens regardless of their pro
test that the mandates of law be ob
served.

Wife of Proprietor of
Ansonia House Sues
for Divorce.
CLAIMS BAKER
IS TOO FICKLE
It was admitted by Collins that should
the cases be carried to the United States
Supreme Court, as is the intention of his
clients, a decision | will not be reached
within at least four years. In view of
such a possibility It is easy to imagine
the opportunity that would be afforded
the cunning gamblers of Chinatown to
carry on their games unmolested by the
authorities, and it is strongly suspected
that in bringing the proposed suits this
scheme Is uppermost in their minds.
Collins will try to show that the or
dinances are applied exclusively to the
Chinese contrary to the laws of the coun
try and In violation of certain provisions
of the treaty between this country and
the Chinese Empire.
In regard to the possibility of a suspen
sion of the gambling ordinances of the
city during the progress of the case in
the various courts, a move which It Is ap
parent that the Chinese are endeavoring
to make effective at any cost and one
which will no doubt attract much public
attention, should the lower courts see fit
to sustain it. Attorney Collins says that
he had obtained his authority from the
previous rulings of the State courts In the
case of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany against the city and county of San
Francisco, reported In 82 California, an
action brought some years ago to annul
an ordinance relative to the fixing of
water rates. ;i *i^.- :

and asks for an order preventing Theo

Suits for divorce were also filed ! by
Charles R. Klrchener against Dorothea
Kirchener for infidelity, and Ida Abbey
against William Abbey for infidelity. Mrs.
Abbey claims that her husband has $11,
000 cash that is community property.
Judge Kerrigan granted Daisy Esther
Williams a divorce frorn^ William J. Wil

treated her cruelly. Mrs. Williams, who
is a very pretty woman, cried during all
the time that she was on the witness
stand. Between her tears she told the
court that she had become a nervous
wreck because her husband was con
stantly accusing her of being a flirt and
with having a hankering after the society
of other men than himself.

G. C. Mayneld, the fireman, a> boy of
17, had fallen asleep early In the night
and had been awakened by the stationary
engineer. He fell asleep again, however,
and allowed the water in the boiler to ruh
dry. When he awoke He opened the valve
and the cold water rushing in on the hot
boiler plates caused the explosion. The
stationary engine suffered a great deal
of damage. Besides tearing down the
wall, the explosion tore the room from
the repair building. The stationary en
gineer received but slight injuries. The
property loss has been estimated at $50,
000. - !
The marvelous feature of the explosion
was the terrific force displayed. The
mammoth boiler was hurled through the
air and landed on the roof of the car
shops 200 feet away, wrecking the building
and the cars it contained. The yards
were strewn with wreckage for 200 feet
and the wall of the machine shops demol
ished. The shattered cab was cast in an
opposite direction from the boiler, while
only the engine's trucks kept the track
and remained intact. At the time of the
explosion the locomotive was being used
to assist the stationary engine at the
shops.

So frequent were such statements from the lips of
Johnson that people believed them to be true by rea
son of their very iteration, and political experts pro
ceeded to explain them -upon the theory that John
son had no desire for the governorship, but was
eager for a seat in the United States Senate, and
would keep out of the gubernatorial contest and de
vote all his energies, his abilities and his moneys to
the task of electing a Democratic majority to the
Legislature, to the end that the majority might re
turn the compliment by electing him to the United
States* Senate. '
It appears that after making' his programme on
those lines Johnson learned that he would have a
better chance to, control his party by getting into
the fight for the governorship himself and surren
dering the Senatorial prospect to one of his lieu
tenants. A man of prompt action, he at once re
arranged his plan of campaign and went to the front.
His success in the camp has been overwhelming.
He captured first the committee on credentials, and
through that captured the convention and dictated
the platform. He is now in the saddle, or perhaps
it would be more accurate to say he is in the auto
mobile, for he prefers the machine to the horse when
he rides.
Political experts pronounce the Democratic cam
paign in Ohio this year to be a forlorn hope,. but it
is doubtful if Johnson would have accepted the
leadership were such the case. He is a man of many
theories with respect to the, property of others', but
when; his own interests are at stake he is strictly
business. He has made many millions and he knows
bow to handle them orofitablv. HÂ» would like to be
The outcome is a sudden shifting of the chief fig
ures in the little comedy. Only a short time ago
Johnson was declaring with exuberant earnestness
that he was not and would not be a candidate for
the governorship, alleging with many words of
protestation that he deems himself far better fitted to
be Mayor of Cleveland than Governor of Ohio, and
asserting, moreover, that he has plans for the wel
fare of the people of Cleveland which he believes
himself bound to carry out at every sacrifice of per
sonal ambition.
OVER in Ohio the Bryanite Democrats have
met the reorganizes and taken them into
camp. Mq Zimmerman, who was in the
fight at the beginning, was not in it at the finish.
His name was not even submitted to the conven
tion. Only two men were in sight â first and fore
most loomed up the figure of the irrepressible Tom
Johnson, (ind near him the figure of a new man, a
certain John H. Clark, who is nominated as candi
date of the party for the United States Senate.

The Shiek-ul-Islam. the head of the faith, has the
power tÂ» float the green banner, which calls all Islam
to battle for the faith. If it were possible to line up
all Christianity the chance would be more even, and
in the long run it is sure that the fatalists would
be suppressed. But nations count the cost, not irr life
ulone, but in interrupted commerce, disturbed finance
and all the barbarizing influences of such a war. It
would be cheaper to combine, and buy the European
possessions of the Turk and divide them share and
ihnre alike in a raffle than to risk -an armed conflict
that would blaze from the Dardenelles to Lake
Linao.
it is probable that no other soldiers in -the world
would fight loyally under the conditions imposed
upon the troops of Turkey. They are well armed
and officered, but there all resemblance between them
and other armies ends. They are poorly paid when
paid at 1 all, and most of the time are not paid any
thing. Their commissary is so inefficient as hardly
to be apparent at all, and when the revolutionists de
stroy or carry away subsistence in their line of march
they must fight on empty stomachs. Any other
troops would revolt and kill their officers under such
circumstances, but they exhibit the same grim en
durance as the first armies of the Caliphs, which lived
on brackish water and green 'lizards and the weeds
of the desert It must be said that the revolutionists
arc capable of almost equal abstention, and added
to it is the spirit of devotion to what they regard as
the cause of liberty. It is probable that two harder
human formations never came into conflict before.
The war is likely to add to history a chapter that
seems taken out of the narrative of human savagery
of the far past.
The Continental powers' have other reasons than
the presence of rebellion to make them uneasy. Rus
sia, France. Belgium, Holland and others have Ma
hometan subjects. 2nd their neighbor. Great Britain,
is quite burdened with that class of religionists. The
bankrupt Sultan, weak in ail else, is- strong in his
relation to the vast Mahometan world, numbering
two hundred millions, fighters always, fatalists and
willing seekers of death in war in the name ot the
Prophet, who can be roused to battle against the
Christians when he chooses.
THE presence of the Russian fleet, instead of
quieting the rebellion in the Turkish empire,
has given more activity. The Sultan realizes
that he has a war on his hands, and the rulers of
Continental Europe are scarcely less troubled than
he. Their position is one of peculiar difficulty. In
the case of Russia the same elements of internal dis
content are menacing the power of the Czar. It is
difficult for him to support discontent, in' Turkey
without encouraging it at home. None of them can
with safety support the dismemberment of Turkey
lest the example be used against themselves.
The revolutionists in Turkey are giving blow for
blow, and there is left between them and the troops
of the Sult.in no balance of atrocity. It is reported
that they are rapidly adapting themselves to military
discipline and tactics, and as they have good fighting
qualities and are trained in the school of mountain
marauding, they give Stamboul more bad half hours
than it has seen since the Balkan campaign in the
last war with Russia. They do not lack the sympathy
of their Christian brethren in the Slav states on the
right bank of the Danube, and thence come succor
and recruits, arms and ammunition, and there is a
retupe when they need cover.

Secretary Carter of Hawaii was instru
mental in bringing about the change in
the system of conducting elections. The
proposition was introduced in a business
way by a representative of the Califor
nia firm that has secured the order for
the first county election supplies and was
officially adopted.
An order has been received by a San
Francisco house dealing in election sup
plies from the officials of the Hawaiian
Territorial Government, which indicates
that Hawaii will conduct its first county
elections under the California plan in all
its details. The' Hawaiian officials have
considered the county government law,
which Is new, and have come to the con
clusion that while the law does not ex
pressly authorize the employment of a
system of votine that Is new in Hawaii,
at thÂ« same time It does not forbid the
employment of the California system of
registration, voting, etc.
There are five counties Jn Hawaii un
der the new law. Supervisors, County
Clerks and other county officers are to
be elected on November 3. Then the new
order of thinsrs in Hawaii will be fairly
Inaugurated so far as local government
Is concerned.

While this is going on it is rather, nauseating to
an American to read the last eruption of Minister
Bowen, who is in Europe to represent Venezuela
before the Hague tribunal. He, with that disregard
of diplomatic propriety which has too frequently ad
vertised at once the increasing dimensions of his
head and his desire to be an object of interest, volun
teered the statement that he had no doubt all Europe
was surprised to see. him there in the double* capa
city of United States Minister to Caracas and ac
credited representative of Venezuela/ but he was
"proud to say" that he would "always be found
standing up for the weak against the strong."
If he had the faintest glimmer of. a conception of
justice he would know that the weak are the foreign
nationals, individuals/who have been robbed, humil
iated, wronged and outraged by Venezuela, a sover
eignty, and strong in its sovereign righfs. The fel
low is rapidly becoming a greaser after Castro's own
heart, and would do well to resign his post as United
States Minister t and put on a poncho and denation
alize himself.
y^ OR a long time the district of Ciudad Bolivar,
rH in Venezuela, was in possession of the revolu
*Â¦ tionary government, which administered all of
its public affairs, having complete de facto jurisdic
tion and authority! All of the people in the district,
natives and foreign nationals, paid their taxes to the
de facto government: Finally, Castro's army cap
tured the district and the government de facto was
replaced by the government de jure.
This is a process that occurs constantly in the revo
lutionary states of Latin-America. In some of them
it happens several times a year. Under public and
international law the inhabitants are protected in
their submission to the de facto government. When
it is succeeded by the government de jure^the latter
has no right to exact from them again the taxes
they have paid to the government de facto. This
rests upon such plain principles of justice as to re
quire no discussion nor explanation.
When our Civil War closed the same questions
were presented to our government as occur in the
revolutionary states of Latin-America. We decided
them in conformity to public law and international
justice. In Texas vs. White, Chief Justice Chase,
delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of the
United States, said, defining the condition and juris
diction of the de facto government of Texas during
the rebellion: "It is not necessary to attempt any
exact definitions within which the acts of such a
state government must be treated as valid or invalid.
It may be said, perhaps with sufficient accuracy, that
acts necessary to peace and good order among citi
zens, such, for example, as acts sanctioning and pro
tecting marriage and the domestic relations, govern
ing the course of descents, regulating the conveyance
and transfer of property, real and personal, and pro
viding remedies for injuries to person and estate,
and other similar acts that would be valid if emanat
ing from a lawful government, must be regarded, in
general, as valid when proceeding from an actual
though unlawful government."
In Horn vs. Lockhart, an Alabama case, Mr. Jus
tice Field, in delivering the opinion of the court,
said: "The existence of a state of insurrection did
not loosen the bonds of society or do away with
civil government or the regular administration of the
law. Order was to be preserved, police regulations
to be maintained, crime prosecuted, property pro
tected,^ marriages celebrated, estates settled, and
descent of property regulated, precisely as in time of
peace." Mr. Justice Strong, in another case, assert
ing the same doctrine, said: "Any other doctrine
than this would work great and unnecessary hard
ship upon the people of those States, without any
advantage to the national government."
No one ever suggested that, when the war was
over, it was the right of the United States to compel
the people who had been under the de facto govern
ment of the Confederacy to pay again to the United
States their tariff and excise taxes. Such a proceed
ing would have been the essence of oppression and
tyranny. 5 But the principles of public and interna
tional law do not disturb the usurping robber Cas
tro, and he has exacted from foreign nationals pay
ment to him of the taxes they had already paid to a
de facto government, and to enforce the outrage has
put them in prison.

It will be n refreshing evidence of sanity and good
citizenship if such organized force instantly and un
equivocally repudiate the crimes and the criminals
and join in hunting them down, to bring them to jus
tice, that they may get the punishment they have
overeamed.
In the Oakland strike very portentous and threat
ening features have appeared from time to time, and
the orderly people have been much disquieted by the
tendency to violence and disorder.
Recently have occurred incidents of the most
alarming nature that go to the very life of the com
munity. The telephone cable has been cut at night,
destroying the use of the* telephones in one-half of
the city. Life might have been lost by it. The sick
could not call a physician nor the dying seek reli
gious consolation in an emergency. Engagements
and appointments of business importance could not
be made, and there was a loss of time, temper, pa
tience and health among nearly 40,000 people as a
result of the dastardly and cowardly act. As if this
were not enough, in the next night the police and fire
alarm wires were cut at a vital point which disused
them all. and the city was left at the mercy of fire
and crime. This is a felony of tjie highest grade.
The two acts show a reckless and criminal disregard
of law, a defiance of the interests of the community,
a cold-hearted indifference to peril and suffering,
that a savage would hesitate to exhibit. They ex
press the ultimate of bad citizenship, lack of man
hood and excess of cowardice. While they cost the
electrical company involved a great deal in money,
they struck past that object of criminal hatred and
delivered a blow at the vitals of the people.
He is a narrow and shortsighted man who sees in
them anjihing less than a still worse blow at the
good name of organized labor. They tend to make
any accommodation of the original issue involved in
the strike impossible, since the company can hardly
stand before the w'orld in the light of having possibly
taken back into its confidence the reckless criminals
who delivered a whole population over to conflagra
tion and crime and condemned one-half of it to loss
of the means of communication which might have
been necessary to the saving of life or the alleviation
of dire physic?.! distress. There can be no proper
sympathy with such acts, and the misfortune is that
resentment of them projects far past the guilty and' is
not spent until it has included the whole scheme of
organized labor.
IT seems that the strikers on the electrical lines in
Oakland are the victims of the unwise and vio
lent advice which has been common in the col
umns of some newspapers and the mouths of some
perfervid orators. The public always submits t to
much inconvenience, and in some cases to
much loss, during a labor strike. If the reason of
the strike and its methods are in line with the popu
lar sense of justice the men always have behind them
the sure support of public opinion, and in such cir
cumstances no strike has ever failed.
There is a proper human sympathy with labor in
the matter of just wages and right hours which wins
for it every just demand. When this sympathy is
lacking a strike becomes simply a trial of endurance,
and usually degenerates into a competition of force,
in which the law is violated, primordial rights are in
vaded, and there is presented a sad spectacle of law
less passion and defiance, of public order. Even if a
strike succeed by such means the v cause of organized
labor is injured, and every party to it has lost the
finer elements of good citizenship, which dictate re
spect for the rights of others and willing obedience
to the law. Unfortunately the haranguers who seek
every center of disturbance for a display of their
vanity are too often accepted by workingmen as the
guides of their conduct, and the counsel of wisdom,
making for good order, is disregarded.

THE MAN YOU LOVE. I
IT has been said repeatedly tliiÂ»% any woman, who is not positively Pf
deformed, can, with tact and delicacy, win any man she sets her heart Â«
upon, butâcan she? How many women have smilingly accepted M
the compliment of the assertion in public, only to ponder the ques- Â»
tion anxiously, oft times hopelessly, in the privacy of the boudoir, o
What an old,; old. problem it is. to be sure, but oh, how appallingly #
new to most of the (rentier sex who will read these lines. Matrimony fe
â the right man â a comfortable, happy home. ,It is the one srreat orob- g
lem of a woman's life from the cradle to the grave. They are the ideals S
that women have always cherished, always will. And how many, or S
rather, how few, realize their ideals. * S
It is a problem that few men can understand, or, worst of all. ever o
try to understand. Man. with his lordly assumption of all the orerotr-
atives of life worth havinsr. may woo and win where and when he list- Â£
eth. But to womanâ passive, receptive woman â what is sriven? She Â§
must wait her lover's coming. She may not seek, as man does, that which Â«
pleases her most. And out of the lovers who choose to woo she must g
.make what poor selection is afforded her, and, burying the ideal, jjive all S
the fluttering, clinging hope of the future to shaping . the real into 3
something akin to the eod of her dreams. _ q
And in this world of sham and show, of the mad chase for wealth.. S
the problem has become vastly more vexatious than it ever was before** X
Even though it has been lonsr accepted as something akin to a ioke. it o
happens all too often in real life that she loves the poor man. and must Â§
choose between him and a wealthier though less undesirable suitor. S
Perverse woman, say the knowi n Sf and the worldly: but only the jrirl Â§
who has been confronted with such a problem can realize the heartburn- â¢ ff
ing. the sublime emotional tragedy of it all. Whichever way she chooses 8
some great part of the ideal is shattered and â what then? X
Every woman who reads is v s e Â«klng the answer to just such a ques- S
tion. Just a few of thnse who w"^ have tried to answer it for her S
Such a one is the "Half-Hour-Storiette" in the next Sunday Call en- S
titled "When Jabberwock Rode." Curious title, isn't it? Well, it is a Â«
curious story, and one that answe" the oroblem asâ well, read it and Â§
see if you would answer it that way. If you are a woman it is ten Â«
chances to one you would or â would you? 3
Perhaps, after all. you wouldn't, for there is another story that solve* w
the riddle in a different way. It is called "Betwixt Dad and Toe." but S
the problem before the girl is not exactly what you would infer from 8
that titleâ indeed not bv a ereat deal. Nor can you jraess what man- g
ner of finesse she used to brin<? about a happy etidinsrâ the only sort an "
ardent girl will ever accept. Still another ig "Under the Car of the ft
Juggernaut." but the eirl in this story did not have things as much her Â§
own way as you might think sh? did from such a title. Or doe* that Â«

According to a decision rendered by
Judge Sea well yesterday In the suit of
the Pioneer Automobile Company for a
writ of mandate compelling the Board of
Public Works to Issue a permit to the
company to erect a frame building on
Golden Gate avenue and Laguna streets,
the Board of Supervisors has no power,
by a special order or resolution, to relieve
any Individual from the operation of a
general ordinance In terms applicable to
all persons. He therefore denies the
company the writ of mandate and sus
tains the action of the board In refusing
to allow the building to be erected.
The plans for the contemplated building
show that its height is to be flfty-four
feet six Inches, or four feet six
Inches higher than the law allows.
When It was first proposed an
application was made to the Board
of Public Works for a building
permit, which was refused. The com
pany then took its petition to the Su
pervisors, who adopted a resolution giv
ing the required permission. The erection
of the building was commenced, but was
Interrupted by the Public Works Board,
which refused to take any cognizance of
the resolution.
Judge Seawell declares the resolution
invalid. He says:
Section 21 of article 1 of the constitution pro
vides that no citizen or class of citizens shall
be granted privileges or Immunities which
upon the same terms shall not be granted to
all citizens. Independently of that prohibition
It has been uniformly held that a municipal
ordinance which la not equal and uniform in
Its operation and discriminates against or in
favor of particular persons Is unreasonable
and void. ,'
My conclusion is that resolution 3SS7 Is in
valid, that It was properly disregarded by tha
Board of Public Works and that the applica
tion for a writ of mandate should be denied.

The Board of Works yesterday denied

D. T. Sullivan, chief engineer of the
FirÂ© Department, made a voluntary do
nation of $1COO to the city yesterday. Sul
livan was allowed the amount named by
resolution of the Board of Supervisors to
defray his expenses in attending the na
tional convention of fire department
chiefs at Atlantic City next month and in
inspecting various Eastern departments,
v/hlch he was ordered to do by the Fire
Commission.
Sullivan secured the demand from Au
ditor Baehr and proceeded to the City
Treasurer's office. On presenting his.de
mand to Deputy Treasurer Devoto it was
cashed at once. It was then that Sullivan
presented the money to the city.
"Please give me a receipt for this
money." said Sullivan. "I desire to turn
it back into the Fire Commission's fund.
There ha3 been some objection to my be
ing given this money and the vote of the
Supervisors was not unanimous on the
resolution. I therefore will not take the
money and will pay my own expenses to
the convention." , 4 , ' .
Sullivan was then given a receipt for the
$1000 and this he proudly exhibited to sev
eral friends. The only Supervisor- who
voted against the resolution allowing
Sullivan $1000 was Connor, who, while an
admirer of Sullivan, believed it would be
a bad precedent to establish, as other
city officials might desire the same prlv-

its phenomenal growth, with all the other
counties of the State, we find that from
1890 up to and including 1803 the assess
ment roll of all these counties, other than
San Francisco, has Increased only $148,
000,000, while* San Francisco, having only
one-third the population and property of
the State, has alone increased, $127,000,000.
"Now," continued the Assessor, "can
any fair-minded man for one moment Jus
tify the contention that San Francisco's
assessment should be raised, in view of
these facts and figures? Are we not
rather entitled to a reduction ? The duty
of the State board is to equalize the as
sessment â¢ of the various counties of the
State. For them it is not a question
whether San Francisco realty Is assessed
at less than market rates; It should be a
question for them whether or not; San
Francisco property Is assesed on a higher
basis of valuation thr.n is other property
"I shall ask the State board," said the
Assessor, "to grant. San Francisco a re
duction in her assessment and not for a
moment to entertain the idea that San
Francisco should be raised 10 per cent or
any other sum. When it is considered
that during the last thirteen years the
Increase In the roll of San Francisco has
been more than double the increaSfe made
in all the other counties of the State com
bined, it will readily appear how unjust
it would be to raise the .assesment of
this city. Since 1890 the assessment roll
or San Francisco has been Increased
$127,000,009. During this time, a period of
thirteen years, the assessment roll of the
entire State, outside of San Francisco,
Los Angeles County being omitted, has
only increased $52,000,000. During the
same period the increase In the assess
ment of Los Angeles County, including
the large raise made therein this year,
has increased but $97,000,000, and yet Los
Angeles in the past thirteen years. In both
the city and county, has had the most
phenomenal growth in population and
wealthâ far gTeater than has San Fran
cisco. l;V>:
WILL ASK FOR REDUCTION.
Various banks have already responded,
stating that It is their custom to loan
more than double the amount on their
appraisement of city lots than they loan
on counry lands.
WIU you kindly give me a written statement
substantiating what I state regarding the prac
tice of savings banks in the case of loans made
in the city r.nd in those made In the country,
that I may use the same to convince the State
board that this practice of the board of
equalizing the assessments of the various
counties in the State on the oasis of mortgage
should be abandoned by them as unscientific,
unreliable and as manifestly unfair to San
Francisco. Very sincerely yours,
WASHINGTON DODGE,
Assessor of San Francisco, i
To the Savings Banks of San Francisco: The
State Hoard of Equalization contemplates a
raise in this city's assessment. This would
be rank Injustice to San Francisco, as com
pared with the rest of thÂ« State, in my opin
ion. *In ten years San Francisco's roll In
creased $110,000,000. During the same time
the entire State, outside of San Francisco, Lob
Angeles omitted, diminished in assessed value
$:*o,ooo.coo.
The board has had data prepared to prove
that San Francisco ougrht to be raised. This
consists of a study of mortgage values with as
sessed | values. Such a method, as you know,
is manifestly unfair to Kan Francisco, as hero
banks loan up to tiu per cent of values at least
on their own valuation, while In the country
loans rarely will be given at over 30 or 40
per cent. Such comparisons of assessed values
with mortgages has for years forced San Fran
cisco to pay more than her share of State
taxes.
"For instance, if country assessments
are as high as the mortgage at 30 per
cent of the value of the property, it Is
regarded as proof that that assessment
is higher than one in San Francisco
would be if slightly less than the mort
gage at 70 per cent of the value of the
property, although as a fact ours would
be assessed twice as high proportionately.
But' why should the board Insist that
property of citizens and taxpayers of the
State should be assessed on a mortgage
basis, unless the board assesses railroad
property on the same basis? Why should
the Board of Equalization insist that a
piece of real estate, mortgaged for $80,000,
be assessed for $S0,000 or more, while It
assesses a mile "of railroad, mortgaged for
$S0.00O, at $25,000 a mile?
"Let us see how this operates. I have
assessed the property of the United Rail
roads in San Francisco for 65 per cent of
the entire assessment, as made by the
State Board on the Central Pacific Rail
road in California, Including the roadbed,
rolling stock, right of way and franchise.
Now, the board has fixed the "assessment
of the" Central Pacific Railroad for the
same amount as last year. If all prop
erty in San Francisco Is raised, then our
taxpayers, including the United Rail
roads, pay more taxes and the Central
Pacific pays still lass. This is for the
reason that the more the State assessment
roll is raised the lower the rate will be,
and therefore the less the taxes will be
on that property not raised In valuation.
In addition, however, to all this, if the
question were only between the counties
alone, the mortgage method Is all wrong
as far as equalization goes, and operates
against our city."
In this connection the/ Assessor is get
ting statements from the banks on this
subject. He has- sent the following let
ter to the savings banks of San Fran
cisco:
WRONG BASIS OF VALUE.
The State Board of Equalization will
consider in Sacramento Saturday the
proposed raise of , the San Francisco
assessment and Assessor Washington
Dodge is preparing to combat vigor
ously the threatened increase. He says
that the data prepared for the equaliza
tion board this year is'the same which
has been the basia for raising San Fran
cisco'B assessment in the past.
"This data," said the Assessor, "con
sists of a comparison of the assessed val
ue of property, in selected pieces only,
with the mortgage thereon. These mort
gages are selected in such a manner as
to make any conclusions drawn thereon
valueless for the purpose of establishing
a basis of assessment for realty through
out the entire State."
In addition to the foregoing reason the
Assessor will vigorously attack this
method of equalization adopted by the
board for other reasons. "It is manifest
ly unfair to San Francisco," said the As
sessor, "and for this reason: It is well
known that the savings banks in this
city loan at least 60 per cent and even
more, often &0 or 90 per cent, on a liberal
valuation of the property, whereas the
same banks, doing a large country busi
ness, will loan only 30 per cent, c+ in rare
cases 40 per cent of their appraised value
of country property. I have letters from
them to this effect. Now, when the State
Board compares the assessment of coun
try property, with mortgage thereon, of
30 per cent of the value of the property,
and then compares the assessed value of
property in San Francisco with the
amount of the mortgage thereon at 60 or
75 per cent of the value of the property.
It can readily be seen how easily San
Francisco property has been overassessed
for years by the State Board, in compar
ison with other counties of the State.

herty of England to-day defeated W. A.
Lamed of New Jersey and to his title
of champion of - England added that of
champion of the United States. The score
was G-0, 6-3, 10-8, in Doherty's favor, and,
although the last set the American play
er made a heroic stand, he was worn out
by the British expert, and failed to hold
him on the eighteenth game.
By defeating Lamed to-day Doherty
completed the clean sweep which he and
his brother have made in this country
this season. Between them they hold both
the singles and the doubles championships
of the United States and England, as well
as having won the Davis International
trophy without the assistance of any
other player. The two brothers hold a
unique position In the history of the
game, a position that no others have ever
approached. y
Doherty won In straight sets, which Is
a great deal of a surprise,' though he
had been considered a dangerous oppo
nent for Lamed because of his two pre
vious victories over the American cham
plon.f His style tt^day had all the quali
ties that have characterized him before,
the one most prominent "being steadiness.
He was outpointed by the American by

Victory seems to come natural enough
to the Cripples whenever they hooki up
with the home team. Yesterday's tri
umph at Recreation^Park was the second
in a row and Peter's followers did not
have to work so hard to earn it at that.
A little batting matinee during the prog
ress of the final round of the day did the
trick. Mr. Whalen's injury also helped
out considerably. Score, Oakland. 4, San
Francisco, 2.
Perhaps If the faithful Jimmy had not
put his ankle out of commission in the
eighth the Cripples "would have had to
struggle for another round or two ere
they put Uncle to rout. Jimmy suffered
bodily injury for a good causeâ tying up
the score, so no one will be angry at him
for that.
'Twas a surprise to the multitude when
James opened up the eighth with one of
those old style Texas leaguers to right
field. He should have been out a moment
before, but Messerly "dropped his foul tip
and this incidentally led to tying up the
, score.
Whalen went on to second when Pat
Meany was passed. Then Cap Irwln
roused himself long enough to crack out
his third hit for the day. Whalen dashed
madly. in the direction of the plate. He
hesitated about half way, but Willie
O'Hara was attempting to play Hlndo
juggler with the ball and then Whalen
started to run again. At third he wrench
ed his ankle, but bravely kept on his
course till the rubber was reached and
the score tied.
Jimmy fell exhausted and had to be
carried to his dressing-room. Hodson was
sent out in the thick of the fight and the
Cripples at once began to bombard his
offerings. For a" starter he passed
Francks and then Messerly clouted the
leather over second. Pete Lohman ad
vanced them both with a sacrifice. Moski
man produced a long fly to right field,
which gave Francks ample time to score.
O'Hara came through with the last hit
of the day and Messerly trotted over the
pan. 1
Dr. Mosklman had one of his long
looked for good days on the slab and he
gave a grand exhibition of the pitcher's
art. In only two innings did the natives
get 1 near his offerings. He fielded his po
sition and hit the ball In a way to mako
the hearts of the fair fans beat with de
light.
Rube Levy was badly hurt by being hit
in Wednesday's game and so old Buck
Weaver, who formerly -chased flies for the
opposition team, held the indicator. Buck
was given a hand and he performed well.
No one was rude enough to kick, so the
old man got away with his first game
nicely. The score:

Messerly was the only man who succeedo-J
Jn stealing a base in yesterday's game.
Henry Krug was the sole player who was
unfortunate enough to strike out.
â¢ The score was tied when Jimmy Whalen was
retired from the game, so according to the
rules the .credit of the defeat is all Hodson'e.
Umpire Buck Weaver did not say what he
thought Ell the time. When a good one would
oome over Buck sometimes called It a ball.
Then he would take It back In a hurry and
yell "Strike 1 ."
Homer Hillebrand seems to be one of those,
players who believes In hitting at every good
ball that comes over the rubber. He will hit
at a good one every time.
Uncle Henry's pitching staff Is In a bad way
right now. Ibenr is sick in bed and Whalen
has his ankle wrenched, " so Hodson, Herr and
Llndsey will hav* to do all the work for a
while or till another pitcher can be un
earthed.
Arthur Hillebrand arrived in town yesterday
and was out at the same. He is a giant in
stature and looks like one of the kind of ball
players to win the hearts of the ladies. Pete

Racing at The Meadows.
The pacing stake was virtually In the
nature of a walkover for Seymour M,
which brought $20 in -the pooling done,
against JS for Friskarina. and My Way.
Driven by O. Spencer, the baby "wlggler"
led from the word in each heat. In the
second heat My Way was distanced.
Tom Smith, with J. W. Zibble In tha
sulky, and a pronounced favorite over the
other three starters, came awful, awful
close to being distanced in the first heat.
All interest in the race waa eventually
lost because of it being allowed to drag:
through the greater portion of the after
noon. This also spoiled the betting, for
the San Francisco contingent waa com
pelled to leave before the race was over
in order to catch the returning train.
The drivers displayed about as much ani
mation as potato peddlers and then the
friends of the harness*, horse cannot see
why the running horse game Is so popu
lar. If each owner or driver of a harness
horse did not imagine that he carried
around one great show under the one big
canvas, things might be different. Rozelle
captured the first heat with comparative
ease. Tom Smith making a break soon
after the word was given. In the next
heat Rozelle tossed off a boot and was
fortunate In not being declared distanced,
as he ran for nearly half a, mile, the fa
vorite, Tom Smith, scoring without effort.
With the pooling business at a standstill.
Tom Smith v was unsteady again In the
third heat, and Rozelle Jogged home
ahead of Forrest W. The fourth and de
ciding heat also fell to Rozelle. During
the meeting at Los Angeles last fall the
winner took a heat in a race quoted at
odds of 50 to 1.

The long end players had their fingers
scorched over the downfall of Tom Smith,
first choice for the free-for-all trot, the
race going to Rozelle, a Southern Cali
fornia product.
There was a time, just after thÂ» first
heat, when those who put up $20 on Tuna
to win the three-year-old trot against S3
for the field felt a tritle nervous. The
filly, which is a prominent candidate for
the Occident stake to be decided on Mon
day next at Sacramento, made a "Jimmy"
on the back stretch In the opening heat,
finishing fourth. Little Branch, over
which Cecil held the ribbons, won the
heat in 2:22% from Duplicate. The frlenda
of Tuna, however, were loyal and again
came back with the collateral to bet at
the same odds.' The daughter of James
Madison justified their confidence by tak
ing the next three heats. Little Branch
was the contender In both of the last
two heats, and the first choice had noth
ing in reserve at the close of either.
There were many who predicted that
Swift B will take her measure In the
Occident stake.
As the card was not glowing with start
ling features, the second day of the breed
ers' meet did not attract as large a crowd
as on the preceding day. Tuna, a pro
nounced favorite and driven by Henry
Sanders, a brother of "Two-minute" San
ders, the trainer and handler of l*ou Dil
lon, took the three-year-old trotting stake.
Seymour M, another top heavy choice,
was returned an easy winner of the staka
for baby pacers.
PETALUMA. Aug. 27.â As a sort of In
troductory overture to the trotting and
pacing events at Kenllworth Park to-day
the pacing mare Alone, with a record of
2:09V4, wai sent an exhibition half mile.
Driven by" her owner, T. Barstow, and
accompanied by a runner, she stepped

SARATOGA, N. T.. Aug. 27.â When the
barrier arose for the last time this sea
son at Saratoga track two of a field of
four horses were in motion. They were
outsiders in the bettingâ Past and Dark
Planet. Highlander, sour of temper and
vicious, was the favorite, while "Water
Tower, second choice, had been made the
medium of heavy play.
Past and Dark Planet were sent on
their way to their backers' rejoicing by
the starter, while Highlander and Water
Tower were standing still. The assistant
starters plied their whiplashes industri
ously and the two laggards sprang for
ward, but before going half a dozen yards
they bumped together and Water Tower
bolted to the outside of the track. Fuller
seemed too dazed to handle his horse,
which did not get into his stride until
Highlander was 200 yards away with
Past and Dark Planet half a 'dozen
lengths in front of him. Water Tower
was hopelessly out of the race. High
lander seemingly was beaten, but he went
on, and. running in marked contrast to
the work he did two days ago, won the
last event of the year. Summary:

was to be divided.
The lower court held that all three

OAKLAND, Aug. 27.â The following
marriage licenses were issued by the
County Clerk to-day: Antone Nlermeyer,

der Dussen, over 18, Hanford; Leonard J.
Thomas, 24. and Margaret F. McVicker,

18, both of San Francisco.
and in view of these provisions, It is prob
ably impossible to discriminate -in the
matter of direct taxation against corpora
tions holding large amounts of taxable
property. There is, however, a franchise
tax Imposed by most of the States upon
corporations at the time of their Incor
poration, and annually thereafter. This
franchise tax Is In almost all States in
some way graded, so as to tax the small
corporation at a higher rate than the large
one. The first million dollars pays a
higher rate than subsequent millions. In
our judgment the gradation should be
continued, but it should be a grading up
Instead'of down. We would leave, per
haps, the first hundred thousand free and
the first million cheap, and raise the rate
with each succeeding million. The United
States Steel Corporation has a capital
ization of over $1,000,000,000. The gradation
stages might be slow and easy enough to
please the most conservative and yet re
sult in a taxation of ten per cent upon
the last 100,000,000. How . long would the
United States Steel Corporation continue
under that system of taxation?
"Second â We can compel them to render
better and cheaper. service. If the com
bination of the Northern Pacific and the
Great Northern railways is a great
enough public disaster to have the atten
tion which it has attracted It could be
prevented much easier than by a hundred
Sherman anti-trust laws by a single Unit
ed States statute that required any cor
poration engaged in interstate commerce
to reduce Its rates 50 per ; cent J to and
from every point where competition has
been prevented by combination, merger,
common control or agreement. Congress
can enact that any corporation or indi
vidual who engages In Interstate com
merce must furnish Its services or sup
ply Its goods at lower rates wherever by
any combination competition Is prevent
ed than where competition Is left free.
"Thirdâ If necessary, the State itself can
enter the industrial field as a producer
arid restore the force of competition to
its former supremacy by becoming Itself
a' competitor of the great trusts."
Great applause followed the reading of
the report.
The report Is signed by all the members
of the committee, consisting of Walter a
Loran, Henry .Budd, Gardiner Lathrop,
George Whltlock and John Morris Jr.

The board refused to accept the resigna
tion of R. Wtdeberg. clerk at the City and
County Hospital, on the recommendation
of the Civil Service Commission, which
had dismissed the. charges against him.
No action was taken regarding the dis
approval of the Civil Service Commission
of several temporary appointments. The
board wants more than one name certified
by the commission for the positions, but
the latter persists In certifying to but one
name, although the City Attorney has
rendered a contrary opinion. .
The action of Resident Physician Mc-
Elroy In suspending C. J. Callaghan.
night watchman of the City and County
Hospital, was approved.
The board condemned a number of un

Thursday, September 17, at 10:30 a. m.,
as the time for hearing complaints
against the order for the vacation of
premises at 807, 809 and 811 Stockton

The resignation of Charles Moreau, en
gineer at the Almshouse, was accepted.
The Board of Health yesterday adopted
the recommendation of Health Officer
O'Brien regarding the rebuilding of back
areas to any structure throughout the
city, and especially in Chinatown, which
areas have been condemned as unsanitary
because all sunlight and fresh air are pre
vented from reaching these spaces.
Hereafter, when it is desired to restore
these places, the board will require that
one foot of surface soil shall be removed,
a concrete floor placed thereon, upon
which may be built a one-story brick
structure with glass roof, properly ven
tilated. The State Board of Health and

A very pleasant surprise came to W. S.
Gage, of the firm of Gage, Mills & Co., a
few days &Â£j when E. L Chapman of
New York, an old col'.epe classmate he
had not seen for eighteen years, pre
sented himself at the office. The meeting
was attended by its humorous side, as
Gape, who was exceedingly buÂ«y at the
time of the call, concluded that his visitor
was &n insurance agent, HÂ« sent word
out that Mr. Chapman might call asain
to transact whatever business fce had.
Chapman realized that his name was not
remembered by his college companion of
muy years a*ro and insisted on seeing
him. Gage at last consented to an Inter
view, but was not yet ready to talk In
surance, Chapman grabbed Gage by the
hand ax.d was surprised that even then

SAUSALJTO, Aug. 27.â Since the death
of Arthur E. Gilligan Sa-usalitans are par
ticularly anxious that Francis H. Ik-
Grath, who Is accused of having dealt
him a fatal blow during an altercation,
be apprehended. The "hlllites" are vehe

the influence of the race, players that
McGrath was not taken into custody tho
day of the quarrel. The poolroom men
on the other hand claim that they had
nothing to do with the escape of
McGrath.
Frank Daroux. proprietor of one of the

Is without any foundation. Tom Frost al

"The union of the employers is still
stronger and more farreachin? than the
union of the workmen. We are now hav
ing combinations of combinations. The
United States Steel Corporation is a com
bination of a dozen theretofore competing
producers, â¢ who themselves were com
binations of stili other producers, and
these in turn often combinations of still
others. To trace them back to their be
ginning Is like discovering all the multi
tude of sources that bo to make up the
volume of the swollen Mississippi. The
property which the Amalgamated Copper
Company now controls was once perhaps
a thousand mining claims, each one very
likely owned in common by half a dozen
miners. The department store trust has
combined the business of h indreds of
merchants, some portions of which they
acquired by purchase and others in some
other way. It is estimated that the
Standard OH Company has taken, by con
tract or by force, the business of ten
thousand corporations and merchants in
all oarts of the Union. The few present
great railroad lines of the country have
been made up by the combination of hun
dreds of smaller lines, some extensions
of one another and others competing lines.
"The ambition of the shipping trust, per
haps the pet project of the great Ameri
can combiner, has been to control all the
ships that sail the ocean. A hundred
years ago there were hardly two &hlp3
owned by the same Individual or corpora
tion, and even fifty years ago there was
scarcely a ship owner, individual or cor
poration that owned a half-dozen ships.
No one knows but that within the next
ten years a greater man than J. P. Mor
gan will arise who will combine into one
organization all the industries of the land
so that the workman who works for
wages can find but one possiUe employer
and the purchaser of wares can find but
one possible seller. The &teps toward the
formation of one universal Industrial cor
poration which shall crowd out all other
corporations and assume to Itself all the
industries of the land have already been
more than half taken. It is not so far to
go from now to that end as we had to go
to reach the present industrial conditions.
"A monopoly is economically desirable;
that Is, for the Monopolist. The United
States Steel Corporation can produce, no
matter what It sells It then for, its goods
cheaper than the elements out of which
the combination is composed ever pro
duced them. The Standard Oil Company
la economically holy, for it pays 40 per
cent dividends. The Sugar Trust Is eco
nomically correct, for whereas the Indi
vidual sugar refiners lost money on small
capitalization the \ Sugar Trust pays big
dividends on a large capitalization. The
railroad combinations are economically
impregnable for they pay. If Mr. Mor
gan's shipping trust and Mr. Schwab's
shipbuilding trust are failures they are
exceptions to the rule. We cannot there
fore rely on natural forces, on the laws
of supply ' and demand or . on economic
considerations to limit the growth of
modern combinations. _
"If they are undesirable. If the people
of the American nation would be better
off without them, or with limitations put
on them, they must put these limitations
on ' by the action of their legislatures,
their conditions and their courts. The
American bar must act, and the Ameri
can Bar Association must take the lead.
If the Northern Securities Corporation
had been allowed to; go on, the next
thing to follow" It would naturally have
been a United ' States Securities Com
pany, which, would hold the majority of
the stock of every. railroad where the

REMEDIES PROPOSED.
The report proposed the following rem
edies:. Â¦ .; ; Â¦Â¦'[ : -.:'Â¦Â¦ .'.'Â¦.Â¦
v "First, we can tax. them, to death; or; If
that Is too radical, , we. An tax them until
their growth and enlargement Is impeded:
There are constitutional provisions re
quiring . direct taxations to be uniform.
On the subject of trusts the report says
this Is the important question now before
the American bar. It says combinations
are rapidly driving out of business the
small dealers and the small producers.
These two classes heretofore have fur
nished the largest number of petitioners
in bankruptcy courts. But now Industrial
combinations of gigantic magnitude, too
large for a bankruptcy court to manage
and too rich to need ever to be called be
fore it. have been substituted. The re
port adds:
"The modern combination's primary ob
ject Is to control trades and commerce in
plain articles of production and substitute
a more or less perfect monopoly in place
of a more or less free competition. It
changes entirely the basio principle of
commercial relations between man and
man. and, If they are to continue to grow
and develop in tho future as in the past
will rentier necessary most Important
changes in the principles of our commer
cial laws. Combination, as an economic
force, is fast coming to take the place of
competition. The producers are combln*
Ing, the transportation companies are
combining, tradesmen are combining,
workmen as. well as employers are com
bining; everything seems to be coming
into some form of combination and every
body seems to be a^ combiner. The com
petition that still remains is fast disap
pearing. Workmen are refusing to com

the spheres of their activity and extend

UNION OF EMPLOYERS.
HOT SPRINGS, Va., Aug. 27.â At the
morning session of the American Bar As
sociation to-day the annual address. was
delivered by Hon. Baron D. Colt of Rhode
Island, United States Judge of the First
Circuit. Judge Colt's subject was. "The
Reasonableness of the Law."
Walter S. Logan of New York made a
verbal report from the committee on
commercial law. He commended the na
tional bankrupt law and then discussed
the trust question. He eaid It would have
to be settled by the lawyers; If they did
not, the demagogues would. If combina
tions contlnue y competition will ceas,e and
commercial Jurisprudence will eventually
be entirely changed. The committee, he
said, had renehed the unanimous conclu
sion that modern industrial commissions
should be stayed.
Hon. Charles F. Manderson of Nebraska
said the report was calculated to rend the
association asunder. He asked that the
report be read. There was opposition to
the motion and considerable confusion.
The convention, however, agreed to hear
the report at once. It was fully dis
cussed.

Committee's Report Is Likely
to Cause Serious Dis- .
The Grand Jurors were astounded this
evening when their questions adduced the
information from the guards that prac
tically no restraint was placed upon the
convicts who applied for sticks of giant
powder, ostensibly for blasting purposes.
The testimony showed that Charles Tay
lor had charge of the giant powder store
house, and that when a convict asked for
giant powder he would give him the keys
and tell nim to go in and take what he
required.
The Jurors also learned from the testi
mony that Taylor would not know
whether five or two dozen sticks of the
explosive were taken by the convicts. To
the Jurors this testimony seemed to ex
plain how it was that the convicts were
able to enforce their order to get at the
rifles with enough giant powder to blow
up not only the armory, but half of the
prison as well. Members of the Jury have
expressed themselves as confident that
had Captain Murphy been in sole com
mand he would have ordered the guards
to fire at any cost.
The Jury would like to make a report
to Governor Pardee upon its findings, but
finds it Is accountable only to the Su
perior Court The report on the Folsom
Investigation will be filed by the Grand
Jury immediately after the State Fair
season closes, September 12. It is de
clared that the report will very likely
charge official cowardice as responsible
for the memorable prison break.
CONVICTS GET DYNAMITE.
Gillice, not only had the .rapid-nring
Gatllng at his side, but he was armed
with a repeating rifle, and he testified be
fore the Grand Jury this afternoon that
twice he had his rifle pointed at the head
of Convict Richard M. Gordon and could
easily have Idled him had he not twice
been ordered by . Warden Wilkinson to
lower his gun. Under oath he asserted
that while Gordon was using Murphy as
a shield Gordon's head rose at least a
foot above Murphy's head and he could
have killed him without endangering the
life of the captain of the guard. Con
vict Gordon is 6 feet 1 inch in height,
while Captain Murphy Is rather short of
stature. Gillice said he finally dropped
his gun from his hands when he was not
expected to use It.
Lieutenant of the Guard Kipp testified
that while the prisoners were escaping a
horse guard came riding up to the armory
with his gun lifted, ready to balk the ef
forts of the desperadoes to reach the
storehouse of the arms and explosives.
The guard was ordered by his . superiors
to throw down his gun and he did so. It
was further testified that there were sev
eral guards below the station occupied by
Gillice who had their guns pointed, at the
escapes, but were likewise ordered by. the
Warden, or the captain of the guard, un
der his instructions, to lower them.
For weeks it has been a matter of sheer
wonderment by the" public how the con
victs could have'secured possession of the
sticks of giant powder with which they
threatened to blow up the if
their orders to the keeper, coincided in by
the Warden, to open it, were not promptly
obeyed.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. X.â Testimony of
a most sensational character respecting
the administration of Folsom Prison was
brought out at to-day's investigation by
the Grand Jury. Under oath guards told
of a state of affairs at the prison which
startled tho Grand Jury and made them
more determined than ever to probe deep
ly into the circumstances of the recent
break at the prison. It had been the de
sire of the Grand Jury to take* only the
testimony of the guards and not to sub
ject the higher officials to the inconveni
ence and cmbarassment of appearing be
fore It for examination. As an upshot of
to-day's disclosures, howi ver, it was re
solved to require the presence of Captain
of the Guard R. J. Murphy. When the
Jury adjourned to-night it resolved to
meet again on Monday next to enable
a subpena to be served on Captain Mur-
Phy.
Several of the witnesses before tho Jury
to-day were guards who either voluntar
ily quit the prison or were discharged
thÂ«refrom. The Jury might have been in
clined to regard their testimony as preju
diced were it not for the fact that most
damaging . statements were uttered by
trusted guards still In the employ of the
prison, and who were not what could be
called willing witnesses. One of these
guards was Charles Gillice, who had
charge of the Gatllng turret which over
looked the Â«ate from which tne thirteen
prisoners escaped, shielded -y their offi
cial hostages.
ORDERED NOT TO SHOOT.
Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â The American
boy who tried to escape from the French
bark Marechal de Gontaut yesterday, al
leging that he had been "shanghaied,"
was taken from the vessel early this
morning hy Collector of the Port Strana
han, who had gone out to sea on the
revenue cutter Gresham to rescue the
boy. The boy Is named Hugh Thompson,
is 16 years of age and is the son of a
sailor who ships on a coastwise vessel,
which plies between Bansor, Maine, and
points south.
After he had been taken in charge by
the revenue officers, young Thompson
said he had not been forcibly taken to
the beat, but had gone with the consent
of his father. He said, however, that he
thought he was to ship on a coaster, and
when he found that the Marechal de
Gontaut was bound for Yokohama and
that he would be absent for many
rr.rinihs he wanted to return to his homo.
It was after S o'clock last night that
Collector Stranahan decided to go out
after the French bark. He came to this
conclusion after the pilot who had been
aboard the Gontaut returned and report
ed that a boy on that vessel was locked
in a closet and kept screaming for help,
savins he had been kidnaped. The Col
lector pax to sea on ths Gresham immedi
ately.
The GreÂ«htf.m came upon the Marechal
de Gcntaut after midnight. Lieutenant
Hofzscharaer of the Gresham and two of
the crew put off in a small boat and
went alongside the French vessel. ThÂ«
lieutenant â¢ shouted to the watch to let
down a ladder.
"They did net appear to understand
me," said Lieutenant Hotzschamer, *'so I
sprang up the chain plates and got on
the deck.. Two men stood there talking,
but I could not understand them. One of
them waved his hands about arid ran
toward me, but I pushed him to one side
and ran down into the hold. I passed
through i he palley and into the forecas
tle. There were about sixteen bunks
there and up forward I saw the boy. He
was sleeping. I woke him and asked him
if he had b?en kidnaped. He would not
say much at first, so 1 took him up on
deck. There was no resistance by the
crew. I then had a ladder lowered and
the rest of the party came aboard.**
Before the lieutenant boarded the
Frenchman he placed a navy revolver in
his hip pocket. The other officers were
also armed. Collector Stranahan was In
bis official uniform and sent at once for
Captain DeurJerre. He demanded that
the captain shew him the ship's articles.
The Collector said the name of the boy did
not appear on them, which he declared
was a violation of the shipping laws. On
the advice of his legal adviser he claimed
the boy.
Several conferences 'between Collector
Stranahan, Gastoa VelJen, the French
Vice Consul, and representatives of the
charterers cl the Gontaut were held dur
trg the day.
The Collector sent all the details of the
case to the authorities at Washington by
telegrapfc. but later announced that he
had no authority to hold tha ship.
A reveaco cutter was therefore dis
patched to the ship to take off the- reve
nue cffVw placed on board and Instruc
tions were given the commander of the
cutter, to ailoxr the bark to proceed on
her way.
The Collector said he had not received
any advices from Washington as to how
to proceed, bet it Is understood that It
Â¦was Intimated to him informally that he
should act as he did.
The boy Thompson was taken home by
â¢mÂ« parents.

PETALUMA. Aug. 24. 1903.â Mr. Blnneweg
â Dear Sir: You will undoubtedly be surprised
to know that the late Count Van Asperen Van
der Velde was my husband. We were married
privately with the understanding that It should
be kept secret until some of my financial at
falrs were settled. ..-i.'-v:
: It was to Binneweg that the noble from
the Netherlands confided that he had
spent six of the happiest months of his
life as a favorite of the fast and fickle
Princess de Chimay in Paris, and was
then given the "marble heart" by that
beautiful adventuress, who 'deserted him
for the Gypsy musician, Rigo.
In her communication to Binneweg the
writer from Petaluma states that she
was secretly wedded to Count Van der
Velde while the Hollander was stopping
with his countryman here at 830 Broad
way. Careful search of .the marriage
license records for two years and a half
failed to disclose that any license had
been issued to any person bearing the
name of the Dutch nobleman. The epistle
from "Marie, Countess Van der Velde,"
of Petaluma. received by -Binneweg thla
morning, was inclosed in an envelope
bearing the address of the Petaluma
Rochdale Association and read as fol
lows: ,
Count Van Asperen Van der Velde's
embalmed remains are lying In a local
undertaking, establishment prepared for
the interment, which is arranged to take
place to-morrow afternoon, and Binneweg
Is anxiously awaiting to have the author
of the letter from Petaluma put ln s an
appearance or explain her relations to
the dead nobleman more definitely. While
Binneweg asserts that Â£he Dutch Count
never hinted to him that he was married,
he says he will treat the titled lady from
Petaluma with all due courtesy If she
calls upon him, but until she does he will
regard her as a stranger.
Signing herself "Marie, Countess Van
der Velde," and claiming to be the be
reaved wife of the late Count Van Ae
peren Van der Velde, whose romantic ca
reer came to a tragic termination on the
sand dues of the ocean boulevard In San
Francisco a few days ago, a Petaluma
woman has written to Abram Binneweg
of this city, a friend and countryman of
the deceased : nobleman, requesting him
to have a photograph taken of the dead
Count and forwarded to her.

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2HS Center Street, Aug. 27.
The story of the shooting of the late
capitalist Charles R. Llcyd of Berkeley
by his nephew, William Boxall, at San
Bernardino last January is made the
basis of a will contest filed late this after
noon by Lloyd's eldest son, Frederick,
who was disinherited by his father.
Frederick W. Lloyd, In his complaint,
charges that his father was under the in
fluence of Lole Helen Wilkinson, his
housekeeper, and Mary Lloyd, his second
wife.
Last January Charles R. Lloyd was shot
at San Bernardino by his nephew, Wil
liam Boxall. A great deal of mystery
surrounded the case, but young Boxall
was taken Into custody and charged with
an attempt to murder his uncle, Fred
erick Lloyd sided with his cousin against
his own *father and when the will was
filed here recently it was found, that
Lloyd had disinherited his son.
In the allegations in the complaint
young. Lloyd says his father made" his
home disreputable; that Loie Helen \VI1
klnson is a dissolute character, who has
been his father's housekeeper since 1S96,
and after his marriage In 189S continued
her relations with him. The housekeeper
and the wife, young Lloyd says, conspired
against him. He alleges that they worked
together and had his. father under their
control and poisoned his mind against the
son by charging him vglth complicity In
the crime committed by his cousin.
For some time after Lloyd was shot his
life was despaired of. He recovered Â«uf
flciently, however, to be able to travel,
and after giving bonds in the sum of $100.
000 to appear at the trial of Bcxall he was
allowed to start on a trip to Japan In or
der to recuperate. He died en route and
his remains were interred at Mountain
View Cemtery here yesterday.
Lloyd's will was made shortly prior to
his embarkation on his last voyage, and
the complaint filed to-day -declares that
his mind was poisoned against Frederick
b/ the women, who charged that he had

and In the island capital and the Austra
lian contingent included a number of
prominent colonials.
Among the passengers were the follow
ing railed:
The Oceanic Steamship Company's iiner
Sierra. Captain Houdlette, sailed yester
day for Honolulu and the Antipodes. She
carried a full cargo ixr.ii about 300 passen
cors. While the list for Honolulu was
large, mere than eighty cf the passengers
were bound Tor the other side of the Pa
cific. The early arrival of the British-
AuEtralian mail enabled the liner to leave
en tirae, and promptly at 2 o'clock the
lines were cast off and the Sierra was
backing majestically into the stream. The
Oceanic dock wax crowded with friends
vt lhe passengers and good-bys were
waved from the end cf the wharf as long
as the Sierra remained in sight.

ing Industry of all America what the Agricul
tural Department at Washington has done for

delphia for commerce and trade, the Southern
Industrial Association for progress of South
ern advancement and what the manufacturing
interests of the country now propose to do for
manufacture in the establishment of a perma
nent exhibition in the city of New York of all

The market shows no . change. The demand
Local trading in fruits was fairly active,
but there was not much- doing in the shipping
line. The canners were still In the market
for clingstone Peaches and the top rate for
bulk stock was easily obtained for choice lots.
Clingstones in small packages were neglected,
but choice frees were in demand at steady
priccB. Good s6und stock In carriers were also
firm, but a large proportion of the offerings in
such packages were of poor quality, hence
the wide range in prices. Canning Plums and
Pears were scarce and choice lota of green
stock would have commanded a premium of $5
per ton over the quoted rates had there been
any available. Ripe Pears in regular boxes
were plentiful and easy. Stocks of Apples.
Plums and PruneB in small shipping packages
were heavy and prices stood as previously
quoted, with the market easy. Receipts of
Grapes were light but ample, and, as there
was very little demand for shipping, prices
ranged lower. Offerings in large open boxes
moved slowly, most Of the. stock being green or
sour. Strawberries. Raspberries and Black
berries were In fair request and price3 stood
about the tame. Huckleberries were too
scarce to quote. Figs and Quinces were easier
under increased receipts. The market was
still badly congested with I Cantaloupes and
Nutmeg Melons, and there were no established
prices for the general run of supplies. Water
melons were well cleaned up and firm.
- There was nothing new to report in Citrus
fruits Ripe Bananas were offering freely and
iret with a fair demand at good prices.

Butter is generally quoted top-heavy. Fancy
creameries keep up. but seconds and dairy de
scriptions are weak and offered to buyers at
concesElona. The retailers are now freely re
sorting to cold storage goods, and this of course
operates against fresh stock.
Cheese, too. is showing a steady increase In
the spct supply and the market Is weak, with
a tendency among the trade to quote lo*er
prices.
Eggs are no higher, and the advance seemÂ«
to be arrested for the present, as Eastern and
cold-etorage stock are being taken by retailers
on account of tlu-Ir comparative cheapness.

UNITED RAILROADS OF SAN FRANCISCO.
NEW YORK. Aug. 27.â Dealings in stocks
were smaller to-day than for more than three
years past, the aggregate dealings reaching
only about 150,000 shares. Trading by room
professionals made uy the entiru market. They
attempted in the early dealings to continue
yesterday's downward course and succeeded to
the extent of a point in a few prominent stocks.
Covering of ehorts before the end of the day
caused the practical recovery of the declines
and the market closed dull and heavy and not
appreciably changed from last night's level.
The dwindling interest in the yacht races did
not result in any increased attention to the
stock market, and many of the members who
came down this morning did not stay the day
out- The preliminary annual statement of
Erie, ehowing r.tarly 4 per cent earned on the
common stock, accorded closely with expecta
tions and resulted in profit-taking sales which
carried the price at one time a point under last
night. Disappointment over this movement re
flected depression at other points In the mar
ket. The news of the murder of a United States
Vice Consul fn Turkey was assigned as the
motive for some selling here for London ac
count, but the Incident awakened little appre
hension In our market, where it was assumed
that the Turkish Government would make all
repartition demanded. The day's weather map
was regarded as unfavorable for grains. Some
selling orders attributed to Philadelphia ac
count were commonly supposed to be due to
the exigencies of the coming reorganization of
the Consolidated Lake Superior Company. The
trade report* in iron and steel were distinctly
more cheerful and indicated a growing demand
at the concessions now ruling. Foreign bank
irr houses continued to make loans here in
spite of the large withdrawals to-day o? gold
from the Bank of England. This had the
effect of causing a somewhat casifr tone In tht
time loan market. No large interior demand
for currency ig yet evident, while in the week
endinp Aueuat SO of last year there were large
transfers both to New Orleans and to Chicago.
Previous to that week last year there had been
the usual assurances that Western bank re
serves wore so large that a smaU requirement
of Eastern reserves was probable. Dut for the
week endine August 30 New York bank re
serves declined j:'.0Cf*,400. On September 6
there was an additional shrinkage of $S.7Â»5.8fNi.
On September 13 the decrease was 57,039,200
and on September SO a further decrease of
$7 .131 700 with a deficit below the legal re
eerve of "$1,642,050. This occurred notwith
standing a loan contraction from August 30 to
September 20 of more than $22,000,000. Tho
severe experience of this precedent more than
anything elsÂ» has prompted the conservative
and cautious attitude of the banks recently,
and. although the usual movement of currency
to the interior is noj*. expected, the opinion
is brewing that the bankers have so carefully
provided tor It that they will be able to meet
requirements without a severe strain In the
money market.
There was slightly more breadth to the bond
market than to the stock market, but it was
dull and irregular. Total eales, par value,
Sl.005.OC0.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

Tlic Turkish Raisin Crop.
iÂ« the report on the raisin outlook
Â«t Smyrna, Turkey. July 15. IOCS, by Hufus W.
Ijine, 'United State* Consul:
. "Ful*ansÂ« â The eorr.lng crop is estimated to

The vineyards are apparently tarrying a ehow
r.f fruit the like of which has never before been
remembered. Consequently there is consider
able <!lFpartty in the estimate of experts. The
figures elven above tre the tnoiÂ»t generally
accepted The Rverage yield of the laat five
years has been rllFhtly under SI, WK) tons. The
stocits remair.lr.g in dealers' hands in Smyrna
are estimated at about 1C0 tons.
Â¦. "Till witbin six cr seven years ago the
avf-repe annual profldcticn cf Bultar.as
amounted to about ."HtCOO tone, terns eeas<-jn.s
hÂ»vinif yields running into 4U.000 ton*. The
rradual spread of phylloxera tended to cause a
steady *nnua.I reduction in the production, but
the low by phylloxera has after a long strug
gle been to some extent counterbalanced by
the vast plantation of American vines, on
which the native riant is crafted. There are,
however, large tracts cf land, ownÂ«-d by Turks,
laid out in vineyards with the native vine.
This it due to the conservative nature of the
Ottoman farmer. In view of the large pro
duction anticipated this year it is likely that
price* will rule at the lowest level recorded
for th* past decade.

GAME LAW CONTESTED
IN FEDEBAI. COTJST
Alleged That the Section Making a
Close Season for Shrimps Is
Unconstitutional.
An attempt was made yesterday In the.
United States District Court to test the
validity of the Sate law making a close
season for shrimps beween May 1 and
September 1. The atteiaot was in the
form of a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus on behalf of Ah King, a Chinese
flshermart, now serving a sentence of ten
days' imprisonment li the County Jail for
violating the law. j
The petition alleges that the law is
unconstitutional, unreasonable, arbitrary
and oppressive and in conflict with sec
tions 1, 11 and 13 of article I and section
24 of article IV of the constitution, and
that it was not the intention of th". Leg
islature to protect shrimps, but to protect
young fish from May to September- It
avers also that the shrimp is a crustacean
and spawns during the entire year and
lives only ninety days, for which reason,
it is alleged, it is a useless, arbitrary and
oppressive act to make a close season for
shrimps for four months.
Judge de Haven der.ijd the petition on
account of certain informalities. These
informalities were corrected later in the
day by the filing of a new petition, which
will be considered this morning.

A Swell Fruit Study
I JUST GATHERED.
I Free Call Art Supplement Next Sunday. |
H V ' C. P. Ream has won a reputation surpassing that of any other artist
By in this country as a painter of fruit. "Just Gathered" is characteristic of
fej his best style, which does not depend upon imitative ability alone for its
if ' excellence, but combines qualities of effect, composition and color har-
M mony, which give his works a pictorial interest not usually found in still-
Is life paintings. L .. .*. . .
H . . ,\ In this picture the plums lie in .the grass as if they had been freshly
|| plucked from the tree, with the bloom still on them, while a ray of sun-
Â£3 light fr.lling on some of them and on a portion of the grass gives effect
M and variety of color to the composition. There is something infinitely
k] more pleasing in this suggestion of a natural environment than to the
j| conventional arrangement of a still life with a meaningless background,
M which is so common in most representations of fruit and flowers.
1| "Just Gathered" was formerly owned by Catherine M. White of U-
i<U linois, who bequeathed it to the Chicago Art Institute, in whose perma-
!| nent collection it now is. It was selected by a committee appointed by the
Â§1 art institute, along with a ricture by William Hart, from a number of-
B lered in the bequest. |

tion . that the medicines were , not ad
ministered according to directions". ;She
purchased her drugs, when necessity
arose, at the Owl drug store or the' one
at the corner of Fifth and Folsom- streets.
She asserted positively that she never
purchased any- arsenic or rough on rats
in her life. . She attributed her .arrest* to
malice on the 'part of Harry Bowers and
his wife, whom she roundly denounced! :
TELLS OF TREATMENT.
She was married, she said, several years
ago In Portland to an aged man named
Dale, from, whom she secured a divorce
In about a year after the wedding. Then
she married Alfred Allen, with whom she
came to this city. She was divorced from
him, she alleges, on the ground of cruelty.
Subsequently she t was Bowers' house
keeper, and on New Year's day, 1902, they
were â¢ married by Rev.J. A. B. Wilson,
at. that time connected with the Howard
Street. Methodist Church.
Mrs. Bowers . denies ever ; havlne * had
any serious -'auarrels with .her \ last ', hus
band'and states that they ' were always
devoted- to, each other. She told how both
of 'them were taken sick after partaking
of the hani and eggs on the fateful Sun
day morning following her husband's re
turn, from Vallejo. If her husband was
poisoned, she says, no blame' can be at
tached to her. They had decided, she
avers, that they could do better in Oregon
and were I intending to : go to 'Portland*
when her husband was stricken.
Mrs. Martin Bowers was Immediately
taken into one office at the Hall of Jus
tice and her sister into another. Both
were severely questioned by. the police.
The suspected woman answered all ques
tions readllv. but 'would not admit that
she.had been guilty of anything unlaw
ful. She . informed Chief of Police Witt
man and Detectives Ryan, Reynolds and
Coleman that she had withdrawn the
money ' from the Hibernia Bank and
placed it with the German Savings and
Loan Society. Her idea in this, she de
clared, was to get it out of, the way of
her brother-in-law, who, she thought, in
tended to make trouble for her. She had
planned, ehe asserted, to draw the money
again and go to Portland, 1 Or., her former
home.
It was found on inquiry at the Hibernia
Bank that Mrs. Bowers had drawn all
the money placed there by her husband.
She was not at 370 Clementina street. De
tectives Coleman and Reynolds finally lo
cated her at Peterson's undertaking: es
tablishment in company with her sister,
Mrs. Z. C. Sutton of 154 Eddy street.
They were requested to accompany trie
officers to the Hall of Justice, and did
so, but with reluctance. Harry Bowers,
who had been stationed at the ferrv to
intercept his sister-in-law in case she
should attempt to depart from the city
at that point, was informed of the cap
ture and allowed to go to his home.
DRAWS MONEY FROM BANK.
had been a sufferer fronTfatty degenera
tion of the kidneys and advanced tuber
culosis. Other organs were also found to
be in a bad condition.
It was evident that the man could not
have lived for any length of time with
so many serious disorders and death was
supposed to have resulted from natural
causes. In order that there misht be
no mistake, however, the stomach and
intestines were submitted to Professor
Green for chemical analysis. He made
a partial report to the Coroner yesterday
that the oreans sent to him contained
arsenic in considerable quantities -and
sufficient to cause death. The matter
was reported to the police authorities at
once. Four detectives were detailed spe
cially to locate Mrs. Martin Bowers and
the dragnets were set at the railroad, sta
tions and in various other localities.
nAKTIN L. BOWERS died at the
German Hospital Tuesday after
noon of arsenical poisoning. His
former wife is now in the City
Prison on suspicion of having
administered the fatal drug. Patrick
O'Leary, her friend, is also behind the
bars. The brother and sister-in-law of
the deceased are confident that the
woman committed murder. San Fran
cisco's best detectives are scouring the
city for clews that may be productive
of more definite Information than is now
at hand. There is much circumstantial
evidence against the dead man's wife.
These are the main facts in the case
so far as it has progressed. Behind it
all are a series of stories reeking of the
lower level of life.
As has already been told in The Call,
a veil of mystery hung about Bowers'
death from the first. The man was an
expert bridge builder. He was employed
at ' the Mare Island navy yard until
about the first of June, when he. left his
position of his own accord. It was his
intention, so says the imprisoned widow,
to leave San Francisco for the purpose
of taking up some land in the neighbor
hood of Coos Bay.
Whatever may have been his plans, they
were thwarted by the fatal illness which
made its first appearance the morning
after Bowers arrived In this city from
Vallejo. He came home to find another
man in the house and after a fight, in
which the visitor was severely battered,
and a fierce quarrel with his wife, he
became terribly ill. He grew better and
then sank slowly until he was released
from his sufferings by death. Mrs. Bow
ers, according to her own statements,
has been thrice married. Of all her hus
bands, she says, she cared most for the
last. It Is in evidence, however, that
she was on extremely friendly terms with
Patrick O'Leary.
QUARREL OVER O'LEARY.
When Bowers returned to his home at
370 Clementina street he surprised O Leary
in the house with Mrs. Bowers. The
husband seized a chair and hit the vis
itor on the head with it. O'Leary got
Into the street with all possible dispatch.
Then Bowers turned on "is wife and
for more than an hour, according to the
statements of neighbors, there was a vio
lent altercation. Finally the disputing
couple retired for the night. The next
morning there, was nothing much in the
way of food in the house and the woman
went to Goetjen's grocery on the corner
of Fifth and Folsom streets and pur
chased some ham and eggs. Of these the
couple made a hearty breakfast.
Soon afterward Bowers was taken vio
lently ill with abdominal pains and
nausea. Dr. J. F. Dillon of 396 Fourth
street was summoned to attend the suf
ferer. He states that he found the man
in a serious condition.; The woman as
serted that she also had experienced the
Fame symptoms ' in a lighter form, but
had recovered partially before^ the arri
val of the physician. The -latter" pre
scribed some bismuth as' a remedy. ' Â¦
Bowers' condition remained â¢ practically
unchanged for ; a week. He was. then
removed to the Waldeck â Sanitarium,
where he remained. under the care of Dr.
McLaughlin for a period of- about a
month. He had improved to a consider
able extent in the intervening time arid
it was thought, safe. to", remove "him again
to the (Jlementina-street abode. . Dr.
John Lagpn'was called to attend -the sick
bridge builder, but "relinquished the case
because the medicine was not adminis
tered in the manner in which he directed.
Bowers grew steadily worse and at last
was removed to the German Hospital as
a result of the kind offices of some fra
ternal friends of the Order of Odd.Fel
lows. That afternoon the patient suc
cumbed to the effects of the arsenical
poisoning. It is asserted that the couple
had frequent quarrels while he was ap
proaching the end. \ . .-/
BANK ACCOUNT , IS FEATURE.
Meanwhile, it is alleged, Mrs. 'Bowers
had her husband's bank . account placed
in her name with his consent. He had
on deposit at the Hibernia Bank a sum
slightly in excess of $2800. After his death
the wife made arrangements for the fu
neral. '. - ' â¢
Mrs. Harry E. Bowers, sister-in-law of
the deceased, had heard of her relative's
removal to the hospital ' and went therfc
to see him a few hours before the end.
He had little vitality left, -: but refused,
so It is Batfl, to drink from a glas3 of
water handed him by his wife. The sls
terrin-law was told by , a nurse of the
institution that the patient seemed to be
suffering from the effects ' of poisoning.
She immediately left the sick ward and
went to her home at 20 Perry street,
where she related to her husband all
that had occurred.
Tuesday evening, after the death of
Martin Bowers, Harry Bowers .r and his
wife went to the Coroner's ' office and
voiced their suspicions that all 'was not
right. The hospital authorities . were at
once directed to hold. the. body, until the
arrival of the city officials. *The remains
were removed to the Morgue as ' soon. as
possible. An autopsy was held Wednes

Mrs. Harry Bowers gives some of the
most damaging ' evidence thus far pre
sented to the. police. She made the fol
lowing statement last night:
On Tuesday afternoon I went to Mrs. Bow
ers' houSe- at 370 Clementina street, and to
gether we visited the German Hospital, arriv
ing there about 3 o'clock. We were shown
Into a room in which Mr. Bowers and another
man lay. The nurse In attendance, a young
man, asked Â« me when we ' entered - If r were
Mrs. Bowers. I told him I was not; that the
other woman was Mrs. Bowers and. that I was
Â¦ Mr. Bowtrs'- sister-in-law.
The nurse then called me , aside and asked
me to do all I could to prevent Mrs. Bowers
from making a scene; as her husband was a
very sick man and would probably : not live
until the following day. He then asked me
the nature of Mr. Bowers' illness and . I told
him that ho should know better than I. but
that I supposed It was paralysis, - To this he
answered: "It's no such -thing;, that man Is
suffering from ptomaine poisoning.", ,
He was found -by the detectives, intox
icated. In a Clementina-street saloon near
the Bowers home. He , was too drunk to
talk Intelligently and was put in a cell to
sober up. . Â¦ Â¦ <, ;
Professor Green. will determine the ex
act amount of arsenic ins the" dead man's
stomach and the remainder of the case
will.be ]eft;to the" police
. Physicians state that the fatty degen
eration of the kidneys, observed' by Dr.
Bacigalupi during the course of 1 his ex
amination, might have, beim caused by
arsenical poisoning. Harry Bowers, and
his wife assert that they drank some beer
at the brother's house during.' the prog
ress of his illness, that it was given to
them by Mrs. ''Martin Bowers and that
both were made sick ..as a result. The
husband states that he was' rendered un
.consclous after drinking two glasses of
the liquor. Mrs. Stillman,* with whom
the deceased Bowers" lived prior to taking
up his abode with the suspected woman,
declares that she once heard her rival
state that Bowers would be poisoned if
he should prove unfaithful. ,It is also
stated at police,' headquarters that Mrs:
Harry Walsh of Petaluraa was informed
by Mrs. Martin Bowers that she intended
to draw the $2800 from the Hibernia Bank
and elope.
HAS MOURNING DRESS MADE.
Another interesting fact in connection
with the case is that Mrs. Bowers had
her mourning dress made before her hus
band had departed. She was having tho
garment made by her sister, Mrs. Sut
ton. Patrick O'Leary plays an important
part in the- dread; tragedy. It is he who
was beaten by. Bowers.'." It ' was he with
whom, it is said, the woman intended to
elope. It is he who was arrested* and de
tained by the police last night as a pos
sible accomplice In the probable . crime.
Officers were sent to search the house
at ' 370 Clementina street and brought
back a load of bottles and packages. The
contents of " all these will be "analyzed.
Mrs. ,Bower3 said that while her husband
had been sick he had become worse after
eating some Mellin's food. A parcel con
taining a quantity of this preparation was
found at the house and w^s. taken, with
the rest of the haul, to the prison. It is
thought possible that the arsenic might

MURDER MYSTERY
Mrs. Stillman, who resides at 328 Third
street, stated last night that some time
ago she overheard Mrs. Bowers threaten
to poison Mr. Bowers if he attempted to
desert her for another woman.
I was not Informed that my brother was sick
until three weeks ago, when a friend notified
me of the fact. I and my wife visited him con
tinually before he was taken to the German
Hospital, and on my own responsibility I called
in Dr. John I^agen, but after making one or two
visits he refused to have anything more to do
with the case, giving as his reason that Mrs.
Bowers refused to give the sick man the medi
cines he prescribed. My brother would receive
nourishment from no one but my wife. My
brother was Intimate with this woman when
she was Mrs. Allen and It was much against
my advice 'that he married her.
I suspect that that woman poisoned my
brother. I never considered her a fit companion
for him and never had anything to do with her
or allowed my wife to have anything to do
with her. â¢
Dr. McLaughlln, when seen at Petaluma
last night, said:
I attended Bowers at the Waldeck and while
he was at his home. Then I left the case, as
Mrs. Bowers was not feeding; the sick man
properly. I and the other physicians at the
sanitarium were treating him for poisoning,
which we thought were ptomaine. It Is possible
that it might have been arsenical. They tele
phoned to me that they had sent Bowers to the
hospital and I said that it was better than
keeping him at home. I was. not at all satis
fled with the way the man was being attended
at the Clementina-street house. However, I
did not suspect that any crime was being com
mitted.

Mr. Bowers had met with foul play and de
manded that a thorough investigation be made.
Deputy Brown immediately telephoned to
Peterson's, saying that the wagon would call
to get the body of Mr. Bowers.
Now that I sususct that my brother-in-law
was poisoned I can recall many Incidents
which occurred while I was at his house dur
ing the time he was sick which should have
aroused my suspicions.
Mr?. Cassimira chevez. the pretty young
Mexican woman who lost her husband
and half-broiher by gas asphyxiation in
Â¦ room in the International ftotel on
"Wednesday, was given a home yesterday
irith the family of J. S. Black, 33S San
Jose avenue, and the prief stricken young
woman can remain with her friends till
Ehe Jiears from her home in Mexico.
Mrs. Black, who is also a native of
Mexico, heard of the sad plight of the
unfortunate young woman and yesterday
*he called at the Emergency Hospital and
offered Mrs. Chevez a home with her as
leng <is she wished to remain. The young
widow, with tears in her eyes, thanked
b'r benefactress and left the hospital for
her new abode.

MRS. CHEVEZ FIXDS A
HOME AMONG FSIENDS
The three of us went to Mrs. Bowers' house
at 370 Clementina street, and while there she
said to O'Leary, "I want you to help me
about the house and stay here to-night." After
remaining for a few minutes. I left the house
and wont to visit Mr. and Mrs. Fowser. who
live on Sixth street, near Clementina. When I
entered the house I told them that Martin
Bowers had died at the German Hospital, and
Mr. Fowser. said, "So she has poisoned him at
last, has she?"
The Fowsers and I' talked for some time
and when I left my suspicions were thoroughly
aroused. I proceeded Immediately to my home,
and. after telling my husband just what had
Â¦ Shortly after 5 o"clock we left the hospital
together and went directly to see Mrs. Bowers'
sister, Mrs. Z. C- Button, who lives at 154
Eddy street. On entering the house Mrs.
Bowers said to her sister. "Well. Martin Is
dead," and Mrs. Button replied. "Well, come
in and try on the dress; it's all ready." We
all went In the room and Mrs. Bowers put on a
new .black, dress which .her sister had just
finished. It Â¦ was then about 7 o'clock. To
gether Mrs. Bowers and I proceeded to a little
saloon on Clementina street, between Fifth
and Sixth. She opened the door and called
out a~man by the name of Pat O'Leary,
whom she introduced to me.
TRIES ON MOUBNINO DRESS.
While she was signing the paper the doctor
came in and said the body could not go to the
undertakers, but must go to the Morgue, as
death was caused by ptomaine poisoning and
he would not sign the death certificate. Mrs.
Bowers said she would not have the body go
to the Morgue and that she would see to it
that it went to the undertakers.
I told her that no one had been trying to
take him from her, but she said she knew bet
ter; On leaving the death room we went down
stairs Into the office of the hospital and a gen
tleman asked us to sign a paper giving the
body to the- Peterson undertaking parlors. At
first Mrs. Bowers refused to sign the paper
and asked me to sign it. I told her she was
his wife and it was her place to sign, which
she flnallv did.
a few minutes he returned and stated to us
that the patient was not going to live as long
as he had expected and that he would prob
ably die Jn ten or fifteen minutes.'
The doctor then gave Mr. Bowers an Injec
tion'of camphor in the right arm. Going to
the bedside I asked. Mr. Bowers if he wished
to say anything, arid he answered by asking
to see bis brother Harry, but said nothing
more, and In a few minutes he breathed his
last. Mrs. Bowers cried some and kept con
tinually saying: "Well, he is mine; he la mine
now; no one can take him from me now."
The inquiry Into the business methods
of the Jewelry firm of Schumacher & Co.,
which failed last January, commenced
before a Jury in Judge Kerrigan's court
yesterday. The inquiry is the result of
suits brought by Louis O. Levison, re
ceiver of the firm, to recover the stock of
Schumacher & Co., now in possession of
numerous money lenders, and upon which
the money lenders claim to have a Hen.
The suits were brought by Levison on be
half of the creditors of the firm, and,
through -his attorney, F. G. Heney, he
will endeavor to show that the money
lenders are not entitled to a lien on the
jewelry for the reason that they have
been doing â¢ a. pawn-brokerage business
without haying a, pawnbroker's license.
Heney succeeded in showing by the tes
timony of H. G. Schumacher, a member
of the bankrupt firm, and who is now
conducting a jewelry store in the Palace
Hotel, that he, was in. the habit of ad
vancing money to the guests of the hotgl
on their jewels.
Schumacher admitted that he had done
bo, acting. as an agent of P. H. Living
ston, the alleged principal holder of the
stock of the defunct firm. He said, how
ever, that he did. this on his own account
and not as a member of the firm of Schu
macher & Co. As the witness is accused
of having ' hypothecated the stock of
Schumacher & Co., the admission is of
value to the creditors.
Schumacher said he was not lending
money as a pawnbroker, simply lending
it after the manner of a bank, but accept
ing jewelry as security.
The suits involve jewelry, principally
precious stones, valued at $73,423.83. al
leged to have been hypothecated by Schu
macher with P. H. Livingston, Judah
Boas, O. B. Martin, H. Abrams & Co. and
others.
It is claimed that they advanced only
$39,42$ on the stones and their settings.
She escaped from the institution on
Wednesday night scantily clad. Her
nurse had left the room for a few minutes
after seeing that she was made com
fortable la bed. When the nurse returned
the bed Â¦was* empty and she sounded the
alarm. A thorough search of the prem
ises was made, but no trace of the miss
li:g patient could be found.
Senator Ralston was notified and he at
once laid the case before. Chief Wittman,
who. took prompt steps to locate the miss
ing young lady as far as lay in his power.
The yaucg lady's friends are. -very .in
dignant at the hospital authorities for
allowing her to escape, as they are afraid
that in her present condition something
serious might happen to her.
The young lady is suffering from re
ligious mania" and ' prior to being sent to
the Institution would kneel on the side
walk in a crowded street and pray, thus
attracting a crowd. It is expected that she
may indulge In this form of devotion
which may lead to her discovery.
The youngr lady's parents live in Los
Angeles, and ehe is related to State Sen
ator W. C. Ralston. Her mind became
wrecked recently from overstudy and it
Â¦was decided to send her to the California
General Hospital at Eighteenth and Doug
lass streets, presided over by Dr. Winslow
Anderson, for treatment.
The police frere notified yesterday morn
ing of the disappearance of Hiss Edith
Wolfskin, a highly accomplished young
lady, 22 years of age, and all the stations
throughout the city were furnished with
a description of her with instructions to
take charge of her if she should be seen
and return her to her friends.
