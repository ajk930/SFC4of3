GOVERNOR OF RUSSIA'S FAR EASTERN POSSESSIONS. RULER .OF
. THE- JAPANESE EMPIRE. HIS FOREIGN MINISTER AND TOKICS
REPRESENTATIVE IN WASHINGTON.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N. W., WASHING
TON, Oct. 8. â A comparison of the Russian and Japanese
naval forces in the Far East, side by side in Korean waters,
as reported in a Paris dispatch, is regarded as a development of
the Far Eastern question which may be productive of sinister re
sults. . Neither the State Department officials nor the diplomats
here-feel warranted as 'yet in using the word "war" in connection
with. the differences between Russia and Japan. It is realized,
however, that the situation is like tinder and thata single spark
might bring on a conflagration. The proximity of Russian and
Japanese fighting ships at a time when feeling is running so
high, especially in Japanese waters, is regarded as an element of
danger, not because of any premeditated engagement, but be
cause pf the possibility of an accidental clash between sailors or
commanders which would cause evejnts to move much faster than
under . ordinary circumstances. No advices have been received
here confirmatory of the naval mobilization report.
While the sea fighting forces of the -two powers were much
in evidence six months ago, when Japan took violent exception to
Russian demands upon China in- regard to. the evacuation of
Manchuria, the situation was not then regarded as critical, be
cause it had riot been preceded by a long period of rumors of prep
aration for war, as is now the case. Russia has steadily during
the last three years been increasing her fleet in Asiatic waters un
til it ' is now- stronger jthan the combined naval forces of any two
powers except Japan. The Russian naval force is complete in
PARIS; ,Qct.. 8.â Official information received 'here; shows
that (3.^ formidable^ Russian- fleet,' comprising ninety warships'; of
. A Paris dispatch says a formidable Russian fleet has arrived
at Ma-San-Pho, but The Call-Herald cablegram from Port Ar
thur indicates that the Jbulk of the Russian fleet is- still there. It
is possible the ships at Ma-San-Pho are the squadron from Vlad
ivostok, moving south for the winter harbor. \ â¢
Ma-San-Pho is in the southeastern part of Korea, on the sea
coast, opposite Japan. Russia has long desired the occupation- of
this port arid negotiations for a concession there were' in progress
for several years. These were said to have been terminated on
March â¢30,-1900, when Korea granted Russia a site there for a
coaling depot arid naval hospital. Russia then renounced > her
purpose to acquire land on the mainland opposite Ma-San-Phq
harbor. The Russian Minister at Seoul, in May, 1900, 'informed
the Korean Government that Ma-San-Pho would be 'used as 'win?
ter quarters for Â» the Russian fleet. . ,
. Japanese vessels seldom go there, but' usually , select Husan,
a few miles farther north, i as a port ; of call. Last Tuesday, how
ever, a di spatch from Paris sai d ; that, according ; to official > ad
vices, a* Japanese fleet was in the harbor of Ma-San-Pho, but that
no tropps;had been landed: 'Â¦â¢..;.;: . â ,
PORTfARTHUR, Oct. 8.â A Japanese squadron is maneu
vering off Korea. The Russian fleet is ready for eventual
ities. It is lying with steam up and the vessels are painted
as in war times. It is denied here in highest quarters that the Jap
anese are 'landing troops. *-. ? .

6p*c'.al Dispatch to The CalL
" BUTTE, Mont. Oct. 8.â Daniel Gilmore,
in Inmate of the County Poor Farm,
found a stick of dynamite on the North
ern Pacific tracks near here this morn
ing. A fuse and caps were attached. The
stick of dynamite was about a foot long.
One end had been partially burned. Ex
pert miners familiar with powder who
â¢Â¦vre "Eh"*"- the stick say that an at
i^^^l' Â«Â«i~ciiuv nad been made to fire
it last n!tht ( but that for some reason
the oowdfr failed to explode.
HELENA, Mont., Oct. 8.â The Northern
Pacific detectives now making Helena
thÂ«ir headquarters have received word
that two sacks of dynamite were found
on Tuesday night near Tcwnsend. Nich
olas Rovig, a ranchman who lives six*
miles west of Townsend and whose place
Is on the line of the railroad, made the
discovery.
Four days ago Rovig drove to a stack
after a load of hay. Arriving there, he
found a sleeping man, who awoke at
his approach. The man said nothing, but
mounted his horse and rode away. The
horse looked jaded. Rovig Judged from
its appearance It had been ridden a long
distance. The circumstance did not arouse
Rovlg'e Eusplclons and he gave the Inci
dent no further thought until Tuesday
night, when In getting a load of hay from
the stack he found two sacks of dyna
mite.
Rovig at once notified the Northern Pa
cific authorities at Townsend. The dyna
mite was secured and placed in a safe
place. It waÂ»-believed to be part of that
stolen from the powder bouse of the A.
M. Holter Company three weeks ago.
Rovig was able to give a description of
the man who was found asleep in the
haystack and the officers and detectives
all along the line have been supplied
with It.
The finding of the dynamite is consid
ered fortunate, at the officers believe that
the blackmailers intended to use all or
part of It near the point at which It was
concealed.
Unless the dynamiters- have been able
to replenish their stock of explosives re
ccctly it It tow about exhausted. Ex
traordinary precautions have been taken
to prevent them obtaining additional sup
plies. Powder houses are being watched
ar.d all stores selling explosives are on
the lookout for men who make Inquiries
concerning giant powder.
The Northern Pacific Railroad Company
has increased the reward it offered for
the arrest and conviction of the black
mailers from $2500 to $5000. The State has
offered $3090 reward and Park County $500
reward for the capture of the miscreants.
MANILA, Oct. 9.â The contract dis
covered by Collector of Customs Shuster
In connection with the scheme for land
ing Chinese coolies in the Philippines un
der the guise of merchants, the unearth
ing of which has already resulted in the
arrest of John T. Miller, a â¢ former in
spector of immigration, and the issuance
of a warrant for W. D. Ballanttne. con
tains the following clause connecting the
United States consulate at Amoy with
the scheme:
"There shall be deducted from the
profits of the firm $45 (Mexican) for the
Taotai, $50 (Mexican) for the United
States Consul, $50 (Mexican) for the sec
retary of the United States Consul and $5
for Mr. Lane. Interpreter."
Carl Johnston Is acting consul at Amoy.
It was reported that the name of Consul
McWade, stationed at Canton, was men
tioned as a beneficiary of the contract,
but Collector Shuster says this Is untrue.
Collector Shuster says he has evidence
connecting several United States Consuls
with the scheme. The conspirators, it is
said, have already issued many fraudulent
certificates, under which Chinese have
been admitted here.
PARIS, Oct. 8.â The terms of the gen
eral treaty of arbitration between France
and Great Britain have been concluded
by Foreign Minister Delcasse and the au
thorities In London. There remain only
minor questions of detail and the signing
of the treaty. These formalities are so
far advanced that the treaty is believed
to be an accomplished fact.
The treaty follows" the general lines of
the Hay-Pauncefote arbitration treaty,
which, to a considerable extent, served
as a model. It . la pointed out that the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty, although rejected
by the United States Senate, now serves
the purpose of giving a basis for this Im
portant Anglo-French treaty. The of
ficials also view the negotiations as evi
dence of the sympathetic attitude of the
United States, France and Great Britain
on the practical adoption of the theory of
arbitration.
The treaty is mainly significant in being
the culmination of the rapprochement
between France and Great Britain after
centuries of warfare, the maintenance of
defensive armaments and the recent ani
mosities growing out. of the Fashoda in
cident and the South African war. It Is
also significant of the tendency toward a
rearrangement of the European political
alliances.
The treaty is mainly the outcome of the
exchange of visits between King Edward
and President Lpubet and the visit of
Baron de Estournelles de Constant and
the French Parliamentarians to London.
Official pourparleurs followed.
French feeling heretofore has been
rather skeptical over the practical reali
zation of the treaty and when its ad
vanced stage is known it -will occasion
widespread attention and discussion in
France and throughout the rest of Eu
rope. * , ' .

yOUSSIA has thrown down the gauge of battle to Japan. The date fixed for the evacuation of Manchuria has passed without the slightest evidence of the Czar's intention of

the scene of action has shifted to Korea, which has been threatened by a large force of Russian troops stationed on the frontier. It was probably because of the dispatch of these
forces that Japan recently embarked an army and sent it, accompanied by a fleet of warships, to hover near the Korean coast. To checkmate this move a Russian fleet, said in
advices received in Paris to number ninety warships of all descriptions (obviously an error or an exaggeration), has cast anchor in a harbor to the south of Korea. While making this
display of force the St. Petersburg government has demanded new- concessions of China, and has warned Japan to keep hands off. 'iM

WASHINGTON, Oct. 8.â Speaking of
yesterday's experiment at "Wldewater
with his aerodrome. Professor Langley
said to-day that he was not an eye
witness of â¢ tho experiment, having been
detained in Washington by business. , He
added, however,' that upon,' the report of
Manley, who was Immediately in charge,
he was able to say that tho latter" a first
impression that there had been defective,
balancing was : corrected by an examina
tion. ,The | clutch which held the 'aero
drome on. the launching . ways and .which
should have released it at the Instant of
the fall was found to be injured. Profes
sor Langley continued: : Â» â¢
â¢ The machinery was .working perfectly c and
giving every reason to anticipate a successful
flight, when â¢ this accident, due wholly to , tho
launching ways, drew the aerodrome abruptly
downward at the moment of release and cast it
into the water near, the houseboat. The state
ment that the machine failed for lack of power
to fly. was wholly a mistaken ' one.
i ' The ' engine, . the frame and . all the more im
portant parts were practically uninjured. Tha
engine Is actually. In good working order., Tho
damage done was confined to the slighter por
tions, like the canvas wings and propellers,
and these can be readily, replaced.
. The belief pf those charged with the experi
ment in the ultimate , successful working of the
machine is in no way affected by this accident.'
which Is one of the large chapters of accidents
that beset the Initial stage of experiments so
novel" as the , present ones. . It As ; chiefly . unfor
tunate . as coming Â¦ near the end ' of the ' season
when outdoor .work of this sort is possible. .

Burglars directed their attention to the

night Their plunder was- small, but they
evidently anticipated that such would be
the case, for they visited several places
before they ceased their. work.
The first buildings visited were the large
sheds and depot of the Sutro Electric
Railroad. While people were boarding and
alighting from cars the thieves broke into
a stand owned by Louis K. Lafkas. Then
they passed along and repeated the ope
ration in the shop of another salesman.
Further alone another *stand was robbed
and below the Cliff House still another
crime was committed.
Lafkas appeared before the Board of

that he be permitted to carry a revolver.
He said that his place had been robbed
once before, on which occasion the bur
glars had entered by breaking a window,
and that he felt Insecure In the neighbor

NEW YORK, Oct. 8.â Although pro
fesing his determination to 'contest the
right of the Republican and Citizens'
Union conventions to displace him as
their nominee for Comptroller, Edward
M. Grout has made no appeal to the
courts thus far. The filing of the amend
ed ticket of the. Republican. organization
with the Board of .elections was. made
without protest - from either Grout or
Fornes, and thus one step in the process
of substitution has been accomplished.
President Fornes of the Board of Alder
men issued a statement to-night contain
ing the following:
Because I consented to have my candidacy
â¢ indorsed by the regular Democratic organi
zation I am declared unworthy of going be
fore the electorate upon the fusion ticket â and
by .Mr. Bruce, recently from Delaware Coun
ty and now chairman > of the Republican
County Committee; by Mr. Platt, the "easy
boss" of the Republican party, and whose of
ficial life has been conspicuous chiefly for his
successful brokerage in* public offices In or
der that his henchmen might strengthen him
in the primary contests of the Republican
party; by Mr. Ode 11. a partisan Republican
Governor who previous! to his election to that
! exalted - office was distinguished' chiefly for
his ability to control legislation through the
unsavory meshes of the lobby and whom the
people of this city repudiated' at the last elec
tion by the most overwhelming defeat that any
candidate for public office ever suffered at
Its hands. These are the men and these are
the forces which have cast a blight over the
cause of fusion and struck the deadliest blow
at non-partisan municipal government which
It has ever received.
Grout says:
All parties, all newspapers, agree that I
have been an honest and efficient Comptroller.
I shall stand for re-election on that record,
which all have approved. I shall ask every
taxpayer whose bill this year is reduced to
remember that it would not have been less if
I had nOt been Comptroller.
As a Democrat I shall ask the Democrats
of this city to notice how this situation has
been made at the direction of Plan and his
Intimates and to say whether this Democratic
city shall be turned over to Platt The po
sition of the - Republican machinists and of
Mr. Cutting has become the acme of partisan-,

George Storrar and Deputy Sheriff Malloy

officers as John Kelly.
According to the story told by members
of the Bennlnger family, Kelly visited
their house ' in company with two other
men about 5 o'clock in the evening and
asked for food. Kelly alone accepted
Mrs. Benninger's invitation to enter, and

the drafting of a constitution and by
laws will be taken up. This constitution
will probably be referred to the different
unions for ratification, but it is likely
that permanent officers will be elected at
this conference. Frank W. Buchanan of
the Structural Iron Workers and George P.
Gubbins, president of the Bricklayers'
and Masons' Union, are mentioned as
probable permanent president.
.There is a general disposition among all
of the delegates to have the new inter
national federation work In perfect har
mony with the American Federation of
Labor and other national federations in
which different ones of the building trades
are represented. All of the organizations
purpose to remain In their present federa
tion alliances and to pay their per. capita
assessment.
Adjournment was taken until to-mor
row morning.
Tlllman, when he took the stand, was
asked to explain incidents to which refer
ence had been made during the trial. He
was asked with regard to any messages
he may have sent to Gonzales, saying that
he had sent a verbal message by George
S. Legare, asking him (Gonzales) to meet
him in Georgia. He said Olbnzales wanted
the Invitation put in writing, but he was
afraid it was a trap-. He said also that
ho did not want to violate any of tho
dueling laws of his State.
Asked as to Gonzales' attitude toward
his military career, he said: "It has al
ways been bitter toward me since I was
21 years of age." .
Relative to the organization of a com
pany of Indian scouts which had been re
ferred to, the defendant said he wanted to
organize such a company to take to the
Philippines, but President alcKinley and
the arjny officers in Washington op
posed it.
Asked how he was treated by Gonzales
in his campaign for Governor, the de
fendant replied: "I think those editorials
are fair samples of it." Ho denied that
he had ever been traitor to his uncle, and
said he had not intentionally been dis
courteous to the Senator.

LONDON, Oct. 9.â The discussion over
Chamberlain's proposals continues keen,
but so far the Liberals have made no
organized attempt at a counter demon
stration. Asquith, the Liberal leader,
spoke at* Cinderford, an iron and coal
center In Gloucestershire, yesterday, and
in^ the course of his Bpeech contended
that It was Impossible to retaliate upon
the protected countries without taxing
food or raw material, and experience
showed that retaliation did more harm to
the retaliatora than to the retaliated. The
adoption of Chamberlain's proposals
would foment quarrels with the colonies.
It was a ealufn,ny on the colonies to say
that the unity of the empire was Impos
sible without ; preferential tariffs.
James Bryce, M. P., speaking: at Lan
caster, expressed similar opinions and
characterized Chamberlain's j statements
as "grotesquely "untrue and worthless."
Gerald Balfour, president of the Board
of Trade, addressing a meeting at Leeds,
reaffirmed that the Government was
pledged not to give effect to the fiscal re
form proposals until after an appeal to
the country had been made, and he inti
mated the possibility that after Chamber
lain had concluded his mission it' might be
found that the taxation of food was with
in the range of practical politics.
Sir Charles Tupper, the Canadian ex-
Premier, presiding at a meeting in Lon
don, expressed his complete approval of
Chamberlain's policy.
The Miners' Federation of Great Brit
ain at a meeting In Glasgow to-day, after
a heated discussion, passed a resolution,
by 89 to 5, "that in regard to the views
of the Premier and Mr. Chamberlain the
federation believes that the policy they
foreshadow in regard to protection would
be a great mistake and would ultimately
lead to the ruin of this country, and here
by resolves to protest against any altera
tion of the free trade policy which has
existed for the past sixty years."
CAPE TOWN, Oct.. 8.â Interviews with
leading men in the South African colonies
show that the general trend of opinion
strongly favors Mr. Chamberlain's Glas
gow programme. The putch, who essen
tially are protectionists, will support the
principles of reciprocity.

LONDON, Oct. 8.â -The Foreign -Office has heard nothing of the reported gath
ering of Russian warships' at Ma-San- Pho. The Foreign Office reiterates that
Government advices give no indication of the possibility of a Russian-Japanese
outbreak. ' '- ;.
The Japanese Minister here. Baron Hayashl, to-day described the announce
ment made by the London Dally Mall's correspondent at Kobe, Japan, that Baron
de Rosen, the Russian Minister to Japan, had presented a note to the Japanese
Government contending that Japan had no right to Intervene in the question of
the^ evacuation of Manchuria and characterizing the proposed partition of Ko
rea between Korea and Japan 'as being "fantastical and unworthy of considera
tion."
"The news from Kobe," the Minister says, "is about as unreliable as news
from Shanghai."
He reiterated that there was nothing in the situation in Korea to occasion un
easiness.
"I have not heard, and I do not believe," added the Japanese Minister, "that
Russia has intimated her 'refusal to evacuate Manchuria and that she has re
fused to allow Japan to interfere with her occupation. I see nothing in the situa
tion at the present moment that supports the reports of a warlike attitude on the
part of Russia and Japan."
The Minister added that he had not received a word regarding any concentra
tion or alarming movements of the Russian fleet in the Far East. Regarding the
report that the Russian fleet had arrived at Ma-San-Pho Baron Hayashi
rexntCrked that Russia had only , about forty war vessels in the whole Far
East and it would be a physical impossibility, on account of coal and other sup
plies, the Minister further asserted, for them to remain at Ma-San-Pho. It
would be the most unlikely place for them to go to, even If Russia contemplated
hostilities, as It was .within easy striking distance of Japan's strongest naval base
at Tsu, in the Straits of Korea, So far as Baron Hayashl .knows/ it would be
equally unreasonable for the Japanese fleet to go to Ma-San-Pho.
The dispatch from the British Minister to Japan, Sir Claude Macdonald, while
detailing many requests made by Russia in the negotiations In Tokio, in connec
tion with the concessions in Korea, relating chiefly to wharves, made no reference
to any possibility of an impending crisis.

It was also denied by this same firm
member that Morgan & Co. had been In
any way party to any agreement by the
terms of which their Bhares in the United
States Shipbuilding Company were to be
marketed and sold before any other stock
of the shipbuilding company was placed
on the market.
The formal statement issued by Morgan
& Co. was later amplified by a member
of the firm, who declared that the $75,000
mentioned in the original statement repre
sented the sum which his firm had re
ceived of the $5,000,000 (par value) com
mon and preferred . Ehares of the ship
building company. It could not be lea_rned
â¢when or to whom this stock had been
cold, but the low price which it brought
suggested that the sale was of compara
tively recent date.
The statement issued by Morgan & Co.
to-<!ay was as follows:
' Neither the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co., nor
any; partner, ever had any connection with the
tr.Wption. organization or financing of the
ITnlted States Shipbuilding Company, r.or have
they ever received or owned any of Its securi

Â¦we were parties to any agreement for selling
ttock is wholly untrue.
In Wall street the disclosures concern

Shipbuilding Company given to J. P. Mor
gan & Co.'s underwriting syndicate were
considered the most vital point of all the
testimony yet elicited. The Morgan
Statement admits that the $2,500,000 of
preferred stock and $2*00.000 of common

John Birk and James Henry conduct
rival bakeshops in this city and bitter
feeling exists between them. Some ttme
ago a quantity of flour consigned to Hen
ry came with a shipment of Blrk's goods.
Blrk, It Is claimed, Instructed his baker,
William Burnwent, to put a quantity of
concentrated lye in Henry's flour.
This order Burnwent is alleged to have
followed. Henry's baker tasted of it and
burned his tongue severely. After the
flour had been baked into bread Henry's
baker had some of it analyzed and this
analysis is said to have shown the pres
ence of enough concentrated lye to kill
every person who ate as much as is ordi
narily consumed during a meal.
Burnwent found out that the presence
of the lye in the flour had been discovered
and left town before the Sheriff could
serve a warrant on him. To-day he came
back and this afternoon both ha and Birk
were arrested.

YOKOHAMA, Oct 8.â According to all reports, to-day,
the date fixed for "the evacuation of parts of Manchuria by the
Russian troops passed without a Russian move toward the evacu
ation of Manchuria. In the meantime the Russo-Japanese nego
tiations regarding Korea and Manchuria are proceeding in Tokio
between the Japanese Cabinet and the Russian Minister, Baron de
Rosen. The latter is acting under direct instructions from Ad
miral Alexleff > viceroy of the Far East.
The prospect is considered doubtful unless Russia makes sub
â¢ stantial concessions. The rumor of the Japanese rejection of the
Russian demands is officially denied. The press to-day was of
ficially warned against indulging in sensationalism.
China is understood to be awaiting the result of Japan's ne
gotiations before further treating with Russia for the evacuation
of Manchuria.
The Patrie to-day, in a special from Darmstadt, published an
interview of Alexander Savinski, the Secretary of j Foreign Af
fairs, with Minister ifamsdorff, who, it is claimed, spoke on the
authority of his chief on Russian- Japanese relations. M. Sav
inski is quoted as saying:
"Our agents at Tokio have informed U9 that Japan desires
war and is prepared for it We have enough troops in Siberia to
resist all the Japanese force."
Regarding Turkey and Bulgaria, M. Savinsld said that the
accord between Russia and Austria was stronger than, ever and
that he did not believe war between those two countries would
occur. Â¦ j Â¦â,â¢,. â¢

in Southern Korea, where the Japanese fleet had already arrived.
The Russian ships have anchored within the Ma-Sa^Pho har
bor, alongside the Japanese ships, ' .'Â¦
Several brigades of Russian troops have been moved forward
to the Korean boundary and are now encamped on the border.
Diplomatic negotiations are still proceeding at Tokio. These do

but to the future of Korea. )
every detail. It includes transports, which could be used in an
/invasion of Japan by carrying troops from Dalriy, one of the
terminals of the Trans-Siberian Railroad.
The mobilization of the fighting forces of the two powers is
taken as showing that they both have thrown off the mask and
acknowledged that the Manchurian question is of the past and
less vital than the Korean situation. Japan is directing a protest
against Russia's aggressive policy- in Korea rather than in Man-
The reported movements of Russian regiments to the fron
tier of Korea is regarded as the expected consequence of the dec
lination of the request that the Russian lumber concessionaires in
Korea be protected, made upon the Korean Government by the
Russian Minister at Seoul. Jie was reported as having declared
tyiat if Korea did not protect the concessionaires Russian troops
would be thrown into the troubled district for that purpose.
The report that Russia has proposed to Japan a partition of
Korea, the upper half going to Russia and the lower half, to
Japan, is not regarded here as well founded. It is believed, how
ever, that Russia may have made some propositions in regard to
the continuance of Russia and Japan in Korea.

them from their jurisdiction or claiming
for American missionaries the right to

China since the treaty of 1S5S.
Article 4 is the most Important of tho
treaty. By it the Chinese Government,
recognizing that the present system of
levying dues upon goods in transit, and
especially the system of taxation known
as likin. impedes the free circulation of
commodities to the general injury of
trade, undertakes, after the ratification
of the treaty and at a date to be mutual
ly agreed upon, to abandon the levy of
likin and other transit dues throughout
the empire and to abolish all the barriers
and tax stations maintained for their col
lection. The United States, In considera
tion cf thÂ«- change, agrees, if all other
powers having treaties with China do
likewise, to pay at the port of entry on
all its imports into China a surtax of one
and one-half times the tariff Import duty.
â¢ By this payment they shall assure com
plete Immunity from all other taxation
whatsoever in the empire. Exports from
China shall pay TH per cent ad valorem
(as at present) the whole amount of the
duty being collected at the port of ex
portation. These are the salient points
of this article, which officials believe may
bring about a complete and satisfactory
reform in the fiscal administration of the
empire and enable the central Govern
ment to derive much larger sums from
the internal taxes than it now does, when
*he cost of collection Is perhaps 50 per
cent of the whole.
The negotiations between China and the
United States which culminated in the
treaty signed to-day were initiated under
the provisions of article 2 of the final
protocol, signed by the powers at Peking
en September 5, 1901. terminating the anti
foreign outbreak of the preceding year.
The present treaty has for its object to
extend the commercial relations between
the contracting powrrs by amending our
existing treaty of commerce and naviga
tion with China and other subjects con
cerning commercial relations with the ob
ject of facilitating them.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 8.â The State De
partment was Informed to-day that the
American-Chinese commercial treaty had
been signed at Shanghai and that the
Japanese-Chttese treaty also was signed
this afternoon. An imperial decree by the
Chinese Government has made the treaty
effective bo far as that Government Is
concerned, but it must be ratified by the
United States Senate before ratification
can be exchanged and the treaty put into
operation.
Great satisfaction is expressed at the
State Department at the outcome. It
makes certain that the two ports in Man
churia wi!l be opened to the United
States, no matter what the outcome as to
the negotiations for the evacuation cf
that territory by Russia may be. The
assurance that Russia had previously
givrn. and to which this Government
would insist upon, is that the treaty ar
rangements made with China covering
Manchurian ports will be binding upon
the Russian Government.

REDDING. Oct. 8.â "Kid" "White, one of
the cleverest burglars and slot machine
crackers ever In Northern California,
was caught Wednesday night at Slsson.
Music was the cause of his capture. The
unexpected loosening up of the music
box attachment to a slot machine in a
McCloud saloon early Wednesday morning
led the officer to suspect and pnrsue
White.
About 1 o'clock Wednesday morning
White and his pal, A. Sholtz, broke into
C. H. Prince's saloon at McCloud. They
tore the 50-cent slot machine from Its
fastenings and carried it into the woodS
shed- There they broke into the machine
and took out $29. They then returned and
started to carry off the 25-cent machine.
Just as thev reached the door the music
box attachment turned lcose. The music
awakened Barkeeper Mclntyre. He fired
two shots at the robbers, who were re
treating.
Mclntyre notified Deputy Sheriffs W. G.
Hale and J. Clawson and the two gave
chase. The officers tracked the men, to
Sisson, where White and Sholtz were seen
running- through town in an endeavor to
board the southbound train. Sholtz suc
ceeded in getting away on the train.
White, after his capture, confessed to
the robbery and stated that he and Sholtz
had operated In every town north of
Sacramento. It is believed that White
and pals have been doing all the slot ma
chine cracking in this neighborhood for
a year past.

Alexander McMillan. M. D., a promi-

writes: "On three cases I have tested
Herpicide for dandruff and the result has
been all that could be desired."
Herpicide Is made upon an entirely new
principle, that is, that dandruit and fall-
ing hair are caused from a microbe that
Infests the hair bulb, and, by destroying
the microbe one's hair is bound to grow-
luxuriantly. Herpicide Is the only hair

Rain Coats and Cravenettes are synonymous.
"Cravenette" cloth contains no rubber, but is a worsted material treated by a ,
'secret chemical process before the goods are woven. This process renders the cloth
waterproof, and it never loses its waterproof property.

cloth. Every yard of their cloth bears their trade mark, as shown below.
We buy the cloth direct from Priestly & Co. and make up our own garments. In
this way we sell the coats at only _ one profit and consequently undersell other dealers.
, We are the only firm in San Francisco selling a genuine Priestly English Cravenette
We have the garments in tweeds, cheviots and worsteds in pin checks, over-
plaids, pepper and salt mixtures, and -, the solid colors of oxford gray, slate, black,

stock from $10 to $25.
Every garment is guaranteed waterpfoof. Your money back if any v toat is not

OAKLAND, Oct. 8.â The point was
raised by Judge Ellsworth to-day as to
the BufSciency of the form of naturaliza
tion blanks being sent out to - various
County Clerks by San Francisco printing
houses and which he is inclined to be
iieve are not legal. In the case of Her
bert A. Talbot of Alameda, who was be
fore him to-day for naturalization, the
Judge Inserted a considerable amount of
matter which he deemed necessary ac
cording to the rcQuirements*of the Fed
eral statutes and then called a confer
ence of the other Superior Judges in re
gard to the matter.
There were present at the discussion
Judges Greene, Hall, Melvin, Ogden and
Ellsworth, and while no definite decision
was reached, it was agreed that the mat
ter would bear further Investigation. The
objection raised to the blanks is that they
refer to certain portions of the statute In
stead of enumerating certain things re
quired to be sworn to by the candidate
for citizenship. Thousands of the blanks
have been sent out over the country.

Burling, a prominent insurance man, and
a MPter, Mrs. Page.
Mrs. Burling and her daughter, Mrs.
Page, recently returned to this city from
n Ions sojourn at Coronado.and both were
1-rostratcd at the sad news. The brother
!s at present on a business trip to the
East. Young Burling was married once
before and leaves a 10-year-old daughter.
The child Is at present living with Mrs.
Pape.
i- rancisco
At the time Burling kissed his wife he
handed her three letters, one of which
was aJJressed to her, one to his mother
and one to A. M. Hardman. the mail in
whose place of business Burling commit
ted tho deed. To Hardman Burling; had
confided many things, and had told him
several weeks ago that he intended to
commit suicide. He left some tinanclal
iiXv.'.r in Hardman's hands, and the note
to him m to remind him of a promise in
that matter.
Durii.gr his residence in Glen Kllen Bur
ling- had made many friends. He was de
ppondent over his elate of health, and
this is assigned as the cause for his deed.
His intimate friends are satisfied that he
brooded over his condition until he was
not in his right mind and then sought
purcease of worry by suicide. The remains
will be sent to his mother's home in San
Burling was a resident of San Francisco
and had been spending the ?ummer In
Glen Ellen for his health. He seemed to
be improving, and on Friday last Miss
Minerva B. Lake, also from San Fran
cisco, came up and was wedded to h'm.
Together they came to this city to secure
the license and were about as happy a
couple as ever applied htre for a permit
to marry.
SANTA ROSA. Oct. 8.â After kissing his
wife affectionately and stepping from a
store in which they were standing at
Glrn Ellen into an apartment devoted to
telephone business, William B. Burling
shot himself in the left breast late last
evening and died In an hour and a half.
Burling and his wife had been wedded
cr.lv five day?, the ceremony having been
performed in this city last 'Friday after
noon by Justice of the Peace A. J. Atch
lnson. No indicaticn of the Impending
tragedy was given by Burling prior to
the de*d, which was committed within full
view of his wife and others.
ErÂ«clal Dlcpatch to The Call.
He went from this city to Los Angeles
and thence by railroad to Hedges, where
he engaged an Indian guide to conduct
him across the sixty-eight miles of sand
dunes to Pala Verde. Desert travelers as
a rule prefer to journey across, the desert
at night because of the excessive heat of
the daytime, but Bryant was anxious to
pet to his destination and against the ad
vice of his guide he started out. Not be
ing .used to horseback riding, before half
the distance was covered he was ready. to
drop from his horse from exhaustion. The
sun beat upon the two men pitilessly and
they were without water to quench their
intense thirst. The guide tried to en
courage the school teacher to keep on,
saying that water was just a little far
ther on. They continued some distance
farther, strength being helped by hope.
But the mounds of sand and patches of
cactus, the only signs of vegetation,
seemed interminable. At last Bryant
bowed in his saddle and, completely ex
hausted, slid to the ground. The Mexican
guide was stronger, having youth to help
him, and he continued on in search for
water. The guide was faithful and in an
hour returned, bringing water which he
had secured at a spring two or three
miles away. Weak, but refreshed, Bry
ant was able to continue, but the hard-
Ehips of that trip were too much for him
and he remained at the Pala Verde school
only three week?, when he was compelled
to give it up and return to the coast.
Bryant accepted an assignment to the
Colorado district school, which is at Pala
Verde, on the Colorado River. It is in the
center of a rich cattle country, though
very much cut off from communication
except by river, the steamers on tho Col
orado River making a stop there on their
way north from Yuma.
SAN DIEGO. Oct. 8.â F. W. Bryant, a
school teacher, who makes his home at
Lakeside, in this county, returned to this
city last evening after an experience
which seldom comes to one of his profes
sion. He came near dying on the desert
in the extreme eastern or northeastern
section of the county.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 8.â Articles Incorporat
ing the R. F. Morrow Land and Livestock
Company, which promises to cut a big
figure In the development of the Mount
Hamilton range country, were filed wjth
the County Clerk to-day. The incorpora
tor is R. F. Morrow, the well-known capi
talist of San Francisco. A few days ago
Morrow transferred his immense ranch of
50,000 acres near Mount Hamilton to the
company. The capital stock Is $300,000, di
vided into 3000 shares of the par value of
1100 each. The amount of capital stock
actually paid up is $2500. R. F. Morrow,
W. G. Morrow. Howard Morrow, Andrew
S. Groth and Harry T. Creswell will con
stitute the board of directors for the first
year, taking five shares each. The.prin
cipal place of business Is San Francisco.
The objects of the corporation are to
carry on farming and dairying, fruit rais
ing, winemaking, stock raising, storing
and delivering water and to generate and
sell electricity. The Santa Ysabell and
Smith creeks flow 'through the property,
and as their power has been sought by
the Spring Valley and Bay Cities Water
companies, it is believed the Morrow Com
pany may become a competitor of the two
concerns.

ONE of the most delightful successes in the
way of artistic endeavor ever achieved in San
Francisco is the exhibit of newspaper artists
at the Maple Room of the Palace Hotel. It is an ex
hibit notable for the number Of pictures shown, for
variety of subjects and of treatment, and for the
standard of excellence maintained throughout.
To most visitors to the rooms the first feeling is
one of surprise, for the exhibition far surpasses ex
pectation. It is doubtful if the artists themselves
were sanguine enough to look forward from the start
to such a success as has been attained. To the gen
eral art-loving public of the city the surprise will be
strong enough to force exclamations of delight many
times from the admiring visitor. It is, in short, an
exhibit worthy of a city much larger than this, and
of artists who enjoy a Continental reputation.
It is significant of the earnestness with which many
of our newspaper artists undertake their work that a
considerable proportion of the pictures on exhibition
reveal a genuine ambition to attain something more
than a temporary success. Several of the works pre
sented are deserving of a place in any exhibit of art.
Even those artists who were not so ambitious have
in most cases displayed an originality of conception
or of treatment that gives their work a distinctive
charm and value of its own.
Should the exhibit receive anything like the liberal
patronage it deserves, the effect is certain to be
highly beneficial both to the artists and to the com
munity. ; The success attained this year will stimulate
the workers with a renewed ambition to achieve
genuine masterpieces *of illustration. Such a stimu
lus will go far to relieve the grind of routine news
paper art work and result in further triumphs in the
way of pictorial journalism. The exhibit iV to be
open every afternoon and evening during the week,
and will well repay a visit from any one who has a
true appreciation of. artistic accomplishment.

Of Interest to People of the Coast.
Â¦p^ L'SSIA has changed her position again and
r\ has apparently once more broken her word to
X \ the other powers which in concert sat out the
Liuxcr rebellion. That civil disturbance in China
served as a pretext for introducing into Manchuria
a Russian army, as it did for the invasion of North
China by the military forces of the United States,
Japan. Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany.
When the reason for the presence of these foreign
troop* ceased the nations which in concert had intro
<iuccd them agreed to dates for their withdrawal.
Every country concerned has kept faith except Rus
sia. Her miiitary forces in Manchuria, instead of
being withdrawn, have been augmented. Called to
iccount by the other nations, she has repeatedly fixed
date* for keeping her word, and has repeatedly vio
lated her promise. Now she brazenly declares that
it is a matter that concerns only herself and China,
and that until China yields to her demands she will
not withdraw at all!
But it is not an issue between Russia and China.
It concerns all of the concerted nations which have
honorably kept faith. The open purpose of Russia
is to coerce China into granting to her a monopoly
of the commerce of North China and Manchuria,
Formerly China was held impenetrable by the world's
commerce. It was a closed country. The Western
nations proceeded to open China to the world, and in
the process showed but little respect for the sov
ereign rights of that empire. But in the opinion of
the outside world the rights of commerce -Aere para
mount, and so one commercial concession followed
another until, in effect, the whole empire was opened
to Western trade. Can it be possible that after this
has been done, and so much has been sacrificed in its
accomplishment, the world will permit Russia to
coerce China into assent that she shall again close
half of the empire against all trade but her own?
It is a matter that does not concern China alone,
nor Russia, nor Japan, nor Korea. If the interests
of mankind required the opening of all China to all
the world, those interests are disregarded by closing
half of China against all countries but Russia. Be
hind all this is the insult to the concerted powers
which kept faith offered by Russia's violation of her
word.
It does not seem right that the rest of the world
should be indifferent while Japan alone stands for
good faith. Already it appears that Russia takes
sdvantage of the Mikado's isolation by offering to
join him in the partition of Korea. It will be the
odium of Western diplomacy if Russia be permitted
to <irivc such a bargain. She can do it only by
Japanese isolation. The United States Government
ttiay not have a proper reason for interfering, be
yond the moral effect of a protest. But England re
cently boasted among the diplomatic triumphs of the
Ministry of Lord Salisbury the treaty offensive and
defensive with Japan. It was a convention of sub
stantial alliance against what Russia now proposes.
If its bond be treated with indifference by Great
Britain, it is certain that henceforth there will be but
one power in China and that Russia will be the dic
tator of the destiny of Eastern Asia.

PERSONAL MENTION.
This is variety sufficient to attract general atten
tion. Here is treasure, useful metals in the trades
and arts, builders' materials from the granite founda
tions, through the brick intervening walls up to the
slate roofs. Here is the fuel of the future that solves
the manufacturing problem in California; articles for
the table and the toilet; mineral waters for toning up
the system; gems to adorn the apparel of the people.
The statistics are voluminous and there is not space
here in which to analyze them. It may be said, how
ever, that for the first time since the mineral statis
tics of California have been annually compiled three
counties show each a value of mineral output ex
ceeding $3,000,000. . These counties, in order, are
Shasta, Kern and San Bernardino.
Two counties, Calaveras and Nevada, produced
mineral values exceeding $2,000,000 each. Five coun
ties â namely, Tuolumne, Los Angeles, Amador, Sis
kiyou and Placer â made records above the $1,000,000
mark. The total value of metallic substances, includ
ing gold, silver, mineral paint, quicksilver, copper,
lead, manganese, platinum and chrome, is reported
to be $22,052,796. Of this gold amounted to $16,910,
320. The non-metallic substances are valued at
$3,706,368.
The comparatively new cement industry showed an
output valued at nearly $500,000, an augury of greater
things. The red metal, copper, occupied the third
place in the table of totals. The leading copper
county is Shasta. The total copper output of the
State for the twelve months under examination was
27,860,162 pounds, of the total value of $3,239,975.
Gold holds the first place when the totals of value of
the respective minerals is made up. Petroleum, little
known a few years ago except in very few localities,
holds, the second place, having, for the time at least,
distanced copper.
Altogether there are tabulated by the State Min
eralogist forty-three principal mineral substances.
The list includes asphalt, bituminous rock, borax
and boracic acid, cement, chrome, chrysoprase, clays
for pottery and brick, coal, copper, fullers earth,
glass sand, gold, granite, gypsum, infusorial earth,
lead, lithia mica, lime, limestone, macadam, manga
nese, magnesite, marble, mica, mineral paint, mineral
water, natural gas, paving blocks, petroleum, plati
num, pyrites, quicksilver, rubble, salt, sandstone, ser
pentine, silver, soda, slate, soapstone, tourmaline,
turquoise.
The arid lands of San Diego County yielded tour
malines worth $150,000, and the gem industry of Cali
fornia assumed a respectable position when commer
cially considered. Several counties gave to the world
the very large quantity of 1,701,142 gallons of min
eral waters, possessed of medicinal properties largely
"for the healing of the nations."
17,202 tons.
a CCORDING to annual custom, the State
l\ Mineralogist of California has made a statis
*Â¦ *Â¦ tical showing relative to the mineral output
of this State during the year 1902. 'From the mass of
figures a picture may be drawn replete with interest.
The mines, quarries, clays, oil wells, mineral
springs and desert sands are credited with producing
a value of $35,069,105 in 1902. In, all the vast area
of the State, so says the Mineralogist, only three
counties failed to produce mineral last year. From
the ledges, beds of streams, placers, glittering gravels
and ancient river courses of thirty-five counties gold
was mined.
The desert sands of Kern County, the bed of the
Pacific Ocean in Santa Barbara County and the soils
of other counties were made to yield more than
14,000,000 barrels of petroleum. From the wastes of
Death Valley and kindred forbidding territory borax
and boracic acid were derived to the amount of

For the first time since the detailed sta
tistics have been prepared three counties
show a product each of more than $3,
000,000. Shasta County, although still in
the lead, shows a decrease from the pre
ceding year of $3,007,522. This is account
ed for In the report by the lower prices
for copper and the prevalence of miners'
strikes at the leading producing mines
which caused them to shut down during
a part of the year.
Shasta owes Its precedence to copper.
Kern to Its petroleum and San Bernardino
to its borax. While gold is still the lead-
Ing mineral product. Its yield no longer
puts the greatest gold producing county
in the first place. Nevada County still
leads in yold and silver, closely followed
by Calaveras County, but when total min
eral products are considered Calaveras
takes rank above Nevada County, so says
the report. The difference is due to cop
per mined in Calaveras County. As usual
Shasta County makes the greatest show
ing in silver, owing to so much silver
bearing auartz being used as flux In the
copper smelting operations.
The output of counties ran as follows
for the year 1902:
OUTPUT BY COUNTIES.
The long awaited statistics of the min
ing product of California for the year 1903
were issued yesterday by State Mineral
ogist Aubury from the State Mining Bu
reau. It appears therefrom that the value
of all minerals taken from the soil In
thla State last year was $35,069,105. This
Hhows an increase, but not a very large
one, above the total output of the year
preceding, the advance being but $713,124.
The low price of copper and petroleum
and labor troubles kept the. total of val
ues down. The leading products were
valued as follows:
Gold, $1*5.1)10,320; petroleum, J4.602.1S9';
copper. $3.23d,!r7S; borax and boraclc acid.
IZ.Z&i.iiW, clay* for brick and pottery. $1.
3&<),378; Quickullver. $1,276,524. No other
product reached the $1,000,000 mark, but
there whh a Kr*-at variety of products.
Silver amounted to $616,4L! in commercial
value. Tourmalines were mined to the
value of HVKW). Mineral waters were
worth $C12.477.
The total value of structural materials
was $4,109,023. an increase of $1,161,748
above the record of the year preceding.
Petroleum was produced to the amount
of 14,356,910 barrels, which brought only
$4,692,189. The preceding year there were
produced 7.710,315 barrels. Tne increase in
value has not kept pace with the increase
in amount, owing to the prevalence of low
prices, especially in the valley counties.
The rank of the leading products was
as follows: Gold. petroU.um. copper, bo
rax, clays and their products, Quicksil
ver, silver. In the preceding year the
copper values were more than those of pe
troleum. Quicksilver was fourth and bo
rax sixth In 1901.
CHICO. Oct. 8.â Governor Pardee to-day
made his first official visit to the Chlco
State Normal School. At the special meet-
Ing of the trustees a partial report of Dr.
Van Llew. president of the school, was
read. The Governor questioned Dr. Van
Liew regarding the physical exercises re
quired of students, the supervision of the
home life of those who provide for them
selves, their mode of dress and the care
eserci3ed by members of the faculty In
seeing that none are allowed to sacrifice
health to the "midnight oil."
Tho Governor made a short address to
the studrnt body In the assembly-room.
On being Introduced he was greeted by
the normnl yell, given with the full vigor
of ntronK-volcert youth. He spoke on
school patriotism, stating that although
thÂ« liberal endowments by the State for
the education of Us youth were made at
great cost, they were given with open
handed generosity, not one cent being be
khkIkciJ. I Io pointed out that It was the
duty of tho ntuilent to remember the im
portance "f the priceless gift and to re
pay It by hmrty nn<l efficient service to
tho StHt'\ Mi- <*mi>hnnlzed the import
ance of krrplug healthy bodies, and de
clared that Â»hÂ«-rÂ«* whs little virtue in the
much tnlkoi of "midnight oil." He ad
vised a healthy Interest in the football,
basket ball ami otlwr athletic sports, rec
ommending nn Abundance of intelligent
exercise to the glrla even more than to
the boys.
In conclusion he lamented the fact that
so few young men attend the normal
school?, although there is less complaint
to be registered against Chlco in this re
spect than against her sister schools. He
said he could find no good reason why in
the present day so few men should es
pouse the honorable and honored profes
sion of teaching.
After the morning exercises the Gov
ernor spent the remainder of the fore
ncon in visiting the recitation rooms, the
laboratories and the library and inspect
Ing the plans of the proposed extension
to be erected next year. He expressed
himself as well pleased with the man
agement of the school.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Dickinson also paid a tribute to oppos
ing counsel and Lord Chief Justice Alver
stone's fairness.
Lord Alverstone said he had heard
many leaders of the American bar In
arbitration and in other cases, but Dick
inson's argument equaled anything he
had ever heard, and he had not suffered
by the fairness and impartialit}- with
which he presented his arguments.
John \V. Foster, the agent of the L'nl
ted States, thanked the British Govern
ment in the name of the United States
Government for Its courtesy. Lord Chief
Justice AJverstone paid a tribute to
Counsel Dlckenson and the session broke
up.
The closing moments were marked by
an intensity of interest, hitherto lacking
in the proceedings. As Dickinson finished
his arguments and commenced his refer
ences to International relations and tho
possible effect of the verdict thereon, the
members of the tribunal and the other
listeners appeared to grasp the true im
portance of the proceedings, which had
almost been lost sight of in the puzzling
technical details In which they had been
surrounded. Said Dickinson:
The tribunal is unique and the treaty wtil
entirely miscarry unless at least on* member
shall decide against the contention of his own
people. The faith thus manifested by the Gov
ernments of Great Britain aM America that
Judgment and Justice will h? exalted above the'
plane where the sympathies that have sway
challenges the attention of mankind and <1:-
tlnKUlshes this tribunal >Â«<ve all others. It
does not follow that a failure to reach a rte
cistcn Â¦will show that auch faith was In any
degree misplaced, but if a settlement Is reached
it will be a triumphant epoch in history, thÂ»
struggle of humanitarian principles for thÂ«
substitution of something better than war as
the sole court determining international differ
ences. What could givÂ« higher Inspiration to
those laboring for the peace of the world than
the settlement of these issues, so pregnant c.
possibilities ? If the tribunal should render
Judgment practically unanimous It would h
the strongest assurance yet given to humanity
that the Christian nations are tending to th*
only practical realization of the poefs dream
of a parliament of nations and a confederation
of the world.
LONDON. Oct. S. â The arguments In
the Alaska boundary arbitration wer*
finished this afternoon. Counsel Dicktn
son concluded with an eloquent perora
tion, dealing with the NÂ»nd3 of amltj
between the United States and Great
Britain.
Now the charter, ever since its adoption, has been
administered by its friends. Mayor Phelan secured
his election by insisting that the new fundamental
law should go into operation with its friends in
power. Well, so it was. Republicans apparently be
lieved this, for Mr. Lane admits that San Francisco
is a Republican city. Mr. Phelan took power. He
was supported by the Examiner, but had hardly be
gun to administer the government when the Ex
aminer turned upon him, blacklisted him, and con
tinually held up his administration as inefficient in
some parts and fearfully corrupt in others. So per
sistent were these attacks that the Democratic nomi
nee for Mayor to succeed Phelan ran third in the
race, and the Examiner gave more than covert sup
port to his opponent, Mr. Schmitz, who was an ally
of Democracy and also a friend of the charter. Now
comes Mr. Lane accusing the administration of
Mayor Schmitz of such weakness and corruption that
his gorge rises at the spectacle, and the Examiner
supports Mr. Lane as the solitary' friend of the char
ter, and the only man who can keep its abundant
curses and disabilities off the heads of the people.
In Phclan's time he was put forward as the only
man who could save the city. When Mr. Schmitz
hung up his fiddle and his bow and dove, pompadour
first, into politics, he was selected as the only man
who could save the city. Still the ojd thing isn't
saved, and Mr. Lane says that "now is the time when
the city of San Francisco must be saved" by his elec
tion. Surely a great deal of saving seems necessary
under the new charter which this last self-elected sa
vior says offers facilities "for building up the greatest
and most corrupt political machine that has ever been
offered to the people of this or any other city." In
this connection he offers himself as chief engineer of
the charter â the only man that can keep it from run
| ning away with the rights and the property of the
I people.
Very naturally Mr. Lane's oratory rose into the
pink and orange welkin of rhapsody, and while in the
exaltation of approval of himself he said, "I want a
San Francisco that goes back to that old day when
Christ drove the money changers out of the temple!"
Really, men and brethren, this is getting serious.
It far outgoes the old form o: the same statement,
which stopped at the Augean stables and merely en
abled a- candidate to compare himself with Hercules,
pushing fertilizer with a squeegee out of the stable
of the king of Elis. No Hercules for Lane. No
Greek mj'thology for him. The only standard of
comparison he can find for himself is the Savior of
the world. But Mr. Lane pitches his own tune, and
knows whom his own conception of himself most
resembles. But he leaves nothing for Schmitz and
Crocker. They find that he has entered the garden
of metaphor and picked all the fruit and has grazed
bare of its fodder the pasture of comparison.
According to his idea of the charter it is a sort of
infernal machine, with a time mechanism to fire the
fuse, and will explode and destroy the city unless it
is passed to him to be kept in a bucket of water until
the whizz of its wheels is stopped. He seems to
think that it spit sparks when Phelan had it in cus
tody, and that under Schmitz it has torn up some
parts of the town. But if it is given into his care he
can hold it down. His opinion of Schmitz was given
in parable. He said that in St. Louis there was a
workingman named Butler, a good blacksmith, who
got control of the city and sold Supervisors in
blocks, for spot cash, and is now in the penitentiary.
Therefore beware of blacksmiths and workingmen in
politics, and of course look out for Schmitz, who,
alas! and alackaday! only two years ago was also the
savior of the city and the only man capable of keep
ing the charter from chewing up the town.
Seriously, is it not about time to have an end of
he-hysterics, or oratorical snorting, of political fee
faw-fumming, of bogy-man tactics, of superheated
ambition, of calling attention to one's own straight
front corset, and admit that the people have some
sense and a good deal of honesty, and that among
them there is more than one honorable man?
MR. LAN.E has opened his campaign again.
The process was enthusiastically received,
and it is gratifying to him that he cut his
political watermelon for a company so well 'pleased.
He accounted for himself by declaring that the
people have come to him, with extended hand, say
ing: "We need you now; come back and lead us
in our home." As he tioes not say where he went,
to make it necessary for the people to indulge in
manual extension and ask him to "come back," that
part of it is left in the dark. But on one branch of
his campaign he is not vague. He frankly declares
that he alone can save San Francisco "from a reign
of corruption that is imminent." Here he submits
specifications. He declares that without him the new
charter will "become the greatest curse that has ever
fallen upon this city." In describing the kind of
curse it will be he let it be known that a man can't
drive a nail, nor put up steps, nor change a parti
tion nor a grease trap in his house, without a permit
from some officer created by the charter. He drew
a picture of citizens walking in fear of the Police
Commission, and of a Board of Health plotting to in
troduce disease into every home of the city, all per
mitted by the charter.
Reading his speech one is moved to mutiny and
rage against the charter, which apparently governs
too much. It is evident that Mr. Lane regards the
charter as a great mistake. The Board of Freehold
ers, instead of laboring to create it. should have
adopted Mr. Lane as the fundamental law of the
city, and the people should have voted to have him
as their charter. â¢

threat that unless the cash is forthcoming they will

heart, and their judgment was led captive by their
sympathy for the victims cjf corporate oppression!
With such things going on in a neighboring State
California can hardly afford to encourage the train
robbing industry by releasing from hi3 insufficient
punishment the boss train robber and murderer of
the. West. %
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9. 1903.
A tornado brought death and devastation to a
large area in Kansas the other day, wiping out entire
villages and destroying vast acreages of crops. When
Dame Nature is in a criminal mood she seldom oper
ates on a small scale.
An apostle of the Mormon church, rising to the
extravagance of declamatory speech the other day,
announced in no uncertain terms that all isms are the
work of the devil and are necessarily to be deplored.
Under' this sweeping arraignment what becomes of
Mormonism*
it seems that the way of true love in Sacramento
i* too needlessly strewn with irate mammas, swishing
horsewhips and pugilistic interferes to make
progress either encouraging, enjoyable or desirable.
The young fellow who was lashed, pummeled and
otherwise made to feel the physical inequalities of life
the other day probably thinks that love's young
dream is a nightmare.
xâ^ HRIS EVANS, the train robber and murderer
I of many men, whose life was spared by a re-
V-^ creant jury, petitions for release from life
imprisonment in Folsom penitentiary. He complains
of having been restrained of his liberty for eleven
years, and that during his murderous career he lost
one eye and one hand, and has been separated from
his dearly beloved family for a long time.
The men he murdered were separated from their
families, and the victims of his robberies were separ
ated from their property. He seems to think that the
law has wronged him and should make restitution by
giving him liberty. He begs to assure the public
that his crimes were "errors of the head, not of the
heart," and that he "permitted sympathy for the vic
tims of corporation greed" to overcome his jtfdg
ment! That fine quality of sympathy led him to steal
in transit the money being sent by children. to their
parents, by parents to their children, the earnings of
honest husbands sent to honest wives.
It is true that for the cowardly robbery of these
he was made a popular hero by. the Examiner, and
even Loring Pickering indorsed him as "sound on
[the corporation question," but all this does not ob-
Earthly fame is of so variable a quantity that an
T^aUand man has demonstrated that even the punch
ing of a right kind of a nose will bring it. This par
ticular demonstrator has won a time-honored distinc
tion from the simple fact that when he was a child he
landed on the nasal appendage of the King of Eng
land, who was then interesting as the Prince of
Wales. We should never underestimate the value
of contact with royalty. (

a FEW days ago a famous and stunning beauty abruptly termina-
/\ ted her own wedding ceremony by refusing to Teneat the word
< /* =^ "Obey" after the officiating "clergyman. In consequence she
is still unmarried and her action has set the East by the earsu In
the discussion pro and con (and it is truly remarkable what stand
the women have taken) Father John Talbot Smith of the Catholic
church was appealed to. He haa given his dictum in no uncertain words.
"To tell the truth." he said. "I do not think it is a practical ques-
tion at all. this one of eliminating the word obey. It is in the nature of
things that the man should command and woman should obey, no mat-
ter how many statutory provisions you make, simply because a man likes
to command and a woman likes to obey. Â«
"What is the use of statutes against a natural proclivity or condition?
You can see the wisdom of the church in omitting this word from its
ritual.
"A woman who refuses to obey might please her fancy by the mere
declination to follow a custom, yet she might be the quickest to obey
her husband.
"That is where nature is stronger than ideas. Ideas may become
fads, existing ; r a short while, but nature goes right on.
"I notice that men aTe glad to get the women they want to marry
and the women are equally glad to marry, obey or not, regardless of all
fads and fancies."
There are so many who differ with the reverend father that what
they have to say forms one of the most interesting pages in the next
Sunday Call.
It is almost that very same quality of circumstance that forms the
theme of Robert Barr's great romantic story. "The King Investigates."
and by perhaps a strange coincidence the problem is solved in a novel
way in the fourth and last installment of E. W. Townsend's latest and
best novel, "Lees and Leaven." which will appear next Sunday. 11 The
famous creator of "Chimmie Fadden" has made a big sensation since ap-
pearing as a writer in the Sunday Call.
Then there is a page of "Half-Hour Storiettes." which treats the
problem from quite a different point of view. There you have four of
the cleverest and most touching romances ever written. "The Voice and
the Violin" especially and "The Grammar of Love" as well, which is a
story that you will never forget.
Then there is one of JFrank H. Spearman's wonderful two-page
railroad stories, "De MolaiTFour," which, if you read it (and of course
you will), will constantly recur to your mind with a strange thrill every
time you see the moon. Why? Because Frank H. Spearman wrote it.
and the moon wouldn't be in it if it were not dramatic.
And now harken to a few other special features, which can only be
mentioned in brief because there are so many good things in the next
Sunday Call.
First, the "Me-ows of a Kitty" (are you watching those cats?);
the fourth talk to parents on the "Punishment -f Children." which will
explain to you some of the reasons why you were whipped when you
did not deserve it. when you were young, and why you were not thrashed
when you did deserve it; "The Effect of Imperialism on National Charac-
ter," by Dr. Richard Garnett. C B.; "The Etiquette of the Automobile."
by Madge Moore; "Recollections and Reflections." by Thomas Fitch,
which will tell you things about the Bonanza Kings of the West that you
didn't know before, and. oh. ever so many things besides.
Just watch for the pictures.

Four Chinese Escape.
Four Chinese fishermen escaped last
Sunday afternoon from the custody of
two Chinese inspectors while being escort
ed from the Mail dock to the Appraisers'
building. The escapes were , with thirty
six other Chinese, fishermen who had been
taken from the Alaska fishing vessel for
examinatiorj as to their right to remain
in this country. United States Immigrant
Commissioner North said yesterday that
the forty Chinese were not, under arrest at
the time, but simply being detained until
they should produce their certificates of
residence or other evidence of their right
to remain in the United States.

Carlos Marenes, or.ce a political power
:n the republic of Nicaragua and for years
a prominent member of the Spanish aris
tocracy of the city of Granada, is a guest
at the Occidental Hotel, broken down in
health and comparatively a poor man, the
rf-sult of political persecution, attributed
to the personal enmity of President Ze-
Uya of that country.
Marene-s and his young daughter were
jiaesengers on the steamship San Jose,
Â¦which arrived from the eouth yesterday.
Practically fugitives from the persecu
tion which they are said to have long suf
fered at. tlie hands of rresident Zelaya,
they have come to this country for rest,
wirh the hope that the:r health will lm
j.rove in th* free air of California.
Marenc-Â» and his daughter do not speak
Knglish, and seemingly they are enjoying
some comfort in that fact, for it has
s<*rved them in avoiding Interviews and
giving publicity here to the wrongs which
are said to have hc^n done them in their
-own country. According to the story that
aooompanled MarenÂ»-s when he and his
daughter boarded the fian Jose in the
south, the military forrr-s of the Presi
dent of Nicaragua recently visited his
home at Granada and enforced from him
a loan of $60,000. "Enforced loans" arc
common practices among the rulers of the
o-ntral American republics. They simply
â¢moan that a President sends his agents
'o the homes of wealthy men and com
pela ;hem to give large sums of money
which arc never repaid. An attempt to
compel payment would mÂ«an imprison
ment if not assassination, which has been
frequently the case In those email and ill
governed countries.
Othrr rich residents of Granada were
a!?o called upon to pay over money to the
frrFident and several, that failed were
persecuted by Zelaya. The President, ac
cording to the etory brought by the San
Jose, had long entertained a hatred for
Mar^fs, and Just before the latter de
cided to leave for this country It is
charged Zclaya had him flogged. The or
deal came near ending his life, and he is
a man of advanced yearn. His friends ad
â¢vised him that It would not be safe for
him to remain in Granada, and. fully rec
ognizing that he was Jeopardizing his own
hfe and that of his daughter, the old man
quietly turned over his business Interests
to hie brother-in-law and partner and
liurried aboard the first steamship fhat
touched at the coast, which happened to
bo the San Jose.
Granada has for a long time been the
headquarters of the Conservative party
of Nicaragua. -Zelaya has trained with
the Liberals, and with their assistance It
is said, he has never failed to take advan
, tage of an opportunity to annoy the rich
presidents of Granada, who have been dis
posed to oppose him !n his political ambi
tions.

The court has also reaffirmed its former
decision in the Sobrante case on a re
hearing. Edson F. Adams and his heirs
brought suit against Emily B. Hopkins,
Bernardo Fernandez and Sarah A. Wilson
to effect a partition of the property. A de
cision was rendered adversely to him and
also to Fernandez and Sarah Wilson, who
were the defendante. Appeals were taken
to the Supreme Court and the Judgment
of the lower court was affirmed. A re
heating was granted, but the result was
not changed. The Sobrante tract con
sists of more than 13,000 acres of valuable

Fannie C. Harrington and her two chil
dren aro entitled to a trifle more than

Railroad Company, according to a Su
preme Court decision rendered yesterday.
The husband and father of the plaintiffs
was killed by one of the defendant's cars
on July 4, 1900.
Harrington was participating In a bi
cycle race and while traveling at a rate
of twenty miles an hour collided with the
car and was instantly killed. He was vio
lating the city ordinance against fast rid
ing and the traction company held that
he was guilty of contributory negligence.
The evidence showed that the motorman
might have stopped his car in, time to
avoid the accident had he so chosen and

UPHOLDS VERDICT
Servian-Montenegrin Society.
At a meeting of the Servian-Montene
grin Literary and Benevolent Society on
Wednesday evening President John E.
Kukaviza gave a comprehensive history
of the organization from its foundation.
The society is In a most healthy con
dition financially nnd numerically, appli
cants for membership being received at
every meeting.
After the regular session a smoker was
held and testimonial diplomas were
awarded to Messrs. S. T. Gerunovich, E.
Gudelj, John Sherovich and the society's
physician, C. H. Carlson.
Misses Maud Goodwin, Mignon Judson
and Gertrude Wheeler opened the pro
gramme with a trio, "Coronoch," by
Schubert, and at once it was delightfully
plain to the audience that the rest of the
evening was going to be enjoyed. There
was a delicacy about tho rendition of the
exquisite trio that revealed the master
qualities of tho teacher apart from the
natural gifts and good Judgment of the
singers.
There were numerous gems set in the
programme, but none exceded In brillian
cy Verdi's sparkling and harmonious
quartet from "Rigoletto," the quartet
which, possibly more than all others of
Italian opera, is the most appealing to
the lovers of undisguised melody. The
famous quartet was rendered by Misses
Goodwin and Wheeler, Carl Yoho and
Edward Xavier Rolker. Miss Goodwin
possesses and commands a soprano voice
of fine and pure quality and great was
her success in her songs, "Reina de Saba"
and "LÂ«'Ete." The plaintive, almost mel
ancholy strains of Grieg in his song
"Princess" were poetically interpreted by
Miss Judson, and Joseph Rosborough
gave a goodly rendering of Cloughleigh
ter's descriptive "Sword Song." Carl
Yono sang the ever acceptable "Toreador
Song," from "Carmen," with spirit, and
Miss Gertrude Wheeler won abundant ap
plause for her charming solos, "IVEs
clave" and "Pur Dices^i."
Misses Goodwin and Judson gave a su
perb rendering of a duet from Delibes'
"Lakme." There were several more
numbers on the programme and all re
ceived the same artistic treatment as
given those individually mentioned.
Miss Fanny Dana Janes contributed
largely to the sterling success scored by
the singers, for her accompaniments were
brilliantly played.

The trial of the suit of Andrew Biemel
against Miss Blanche, Reynolds, a cor
netist in 'a local theater, for the security
of $81 65 was begun yesterday before
Justice of the Peace Lawson. Biemel,
who is a sailor, testified that he had
loaned Miss Reynolds, at her particular
request, the sum of $52 50, which she has
never paid back. He also wanted pay
for a silver fox, which he had secured
while making a northern voyage, and
3Â»,Â£ yards of navy cloth, all of which he
had procured for Miss Reynolds at her
request. When Biemel returned from one
of his trips ho wanted to marry Mis*
Reynolds and was astonished when he
ascertained that his fair charmer was
preparing to marry some other man.
Miss Reynolds' defense was that the
money and other articles had 1 been pre
sented to her by Biemel of his own free
will and without solicitation on her part.
She intimated that it was a case of a
man "wanting his presents back," and
Judge Lawson took that phase of the
case under advisement.

That policemen ehould bÂ» bakers or
confectioners and guardians of the peace
at the same time seems strange, yet some
are, if a communication sent to the Po
lice Commissioners be true. It is alleged
that some minions of the law are bun
makers or manufacturers of sweets, and
in addition to drawing salary for such
occupation are also receiving compensa
tion from the city for patrolling beats.
Chief of Police Wittman will make an in
vestigation and endeavor to discover who
the policemen are. The Police Commis
sioners are also Interested in the matter
and have directed that the fullest inquiry
be made.
The matter was brought to the atten
tion of the department in a communica
tion from the Bakers' and Confectioners'
Union No. 24. It was alleged that certain
policemen were infringing on their busi
ness and preventing- members from earn
ing an honest livelihood. The letter di
rected to the Police Commissioners reads:
I have been instructed to inquire from your
honorable board If police officers who are
paid by the city are allowed to work In bak
eries, thereby taking: the places of some of
our members who are only depending on the
baker trade, for an honest living and who ara
without any salaried position from the city.
Kindly answer this as soon as possible, as
Bakers' Union No. 24 would like to know if
your honorable board approves of such methods.
i The communication is signed by Fred
Ruby and an answer is directed to be
sent to 1159 Mission street. Chief Witt
man expressed surprise that such a con
dition of affairs should exist and said he
would give the matter his personal at
tention. He stated that members of the
department were not permitted to engage
In any other occupation and Commission
er Hutton said that if the allegation, of
Ruby was true the offenders were violat
ing a" charter provision. .
Consul Marsily parried questions dex
trously and would not admit that an ar
rest had been made or that he knew*of
an arrest or that a man bearing the
name Arondez was wanted by his Gov
ernment. The Intention of the Consul and
Secret Service Agent Hazen to keep the
arrest and the circumstances leading up
to it a profound secret was well planned,
but failed of its purpose, and the fact re
mains that Arondez will be detained until
the arrival in this city of definite In
structions as to whether he shall be
brought before the Federal Court on ex
tradition proceedings.
Arondez. while amazed at fhe sudden
ness of the detention by Hazen, neither
attempted resistance nor evaded the ques
tions put to him by Consul Marsily. He
was taken to the cabin he had occupied on
the voyage and was Informed that he
would be detained pending further com
munication with Baron Gevers.
The cause of the detention of Arondea
is the allegation that he embezzled $150,
000, the money of the" Netherlands Gov
ernment, while acting in the capacity of
an officer of that'Government at Batavia,
Java.'
Arondez showed no signs of excitement
and accompanied Hazen to private apart
ments in the city, where the Consul and
the secret service agent passed the hours
of the night with him. Arondez was en
route to New York, where It Is belleveO
he has Intimate friends..
When seen yesterday Consul Marsily
would not admit that there had been an
arrest on the order of the Secret Service
Department at Washington at the request
of Baron Gevers. Hazen was equally
reticent, saying that no information could
be given out until sanctioned by tTie
Washington authorities. He evaded in
very subtle manner the questions put to
him relative to the delinquency which
prompted the Netherlands Government to
appeal to the United States Government
to detain Arondez. Nevertheless the ar
rest was made and the man Is In custody,
though not on a warrant obtained In this
city. Â»
It was not many moments, however, be
fore Hazen, armed with authority from
Chief Wilkie of the Secret Service De
partment at Washington, arrested J. F.
Arond<=z, one of the passengers, who had
boarded the vessel at Yokohama, at the
Instigation of Baron Gevers, Queen Wil
helmina's Minister to the United States.
When the steamship Nippon Maru ar
rived in port on Wednesday there were
anxiously awaiting the vessel at ths dock
Kecrct Service Agent llazen and the
Netherlands Consul, George J. O. Maraily.
There was an attempt to maintain the ut
most secrecy and neither the secret ser
vice asrent nor the Consul would admit
that there was business of the highest
Importance to the Government of the
Netherlands to be transacted.

S How the fire started is a mystery. The
Chinese In the place at the time say that
It was caused by a defective flue. No
one, seems to be able to give . a satisfac
tory explanation of its origin, so an in
vestigation by the Fire Marshal will prob
ably* De made. The building was a. two
story frame structure owned by Mrs. Mc-
Cumber. The: loss will probably reach
$5000, partly covered by insurance.
Mrs. McCumber and Yung I^e Suffer
Loss of $5000 Through a
Blaze. - V
A blaze in Yung Lee's laundry at Twen
ty-second and Dolores streets at 9 o'clock
last night caused a triple alarm and
brought the engines from all directions
In as great haste as if a downtown bflsl
nes3 block were ablaze. >Â£
â¢A high wind was blowing at the time
and this was the cause of the three
alarms. The district Is thickly populated
and had the blaze made any headway
much - prpperty would' have been de
stroyed. ..
FIRE DOES DAMAGE
TO , CHINESE LATJNDRY
To-night's contests will be between
bridge workers and plumbers; cement
â¢workers and laborers; car men and long
ehore lumbermen, and carpenters and
tcamstere.
The bridge workers beat the horse
shoers In two minutes, and the carpenters
pot the decision over the cement workers
in a minute and a half. .C/'-i
The car men and laborers put up a
preat contest that lasted thirty-five mln
utee. First the laborers took a decided
lead and held it well, but finally their op
ponents got a gradual and steady pull
r.nd by degrees got the laborers over the
deadline.
Though the teamsters were willing to
admit their defeat, there is no doubt that
they -would have lasted longer and made
a better showing bnt for the fact that one
of their men collapsed.
Excitement ran high in the final trial of
last night's t*jg of war contests at Cen
tral Park. The teamsters and the long-
Fhore lumbermen came together and for
nearly twonty-three minutes tugtred away
Â¦without cither team gaining more than
one cleat. Both teams had clean scores.
From the first sound of the pistol untli
witliin a second or two of the decision It
was nip and tuck, and It seemed that the
teams would be at it for at least an hour,
fo even was the contest. Finally the
long-shoremen, after gaining a slight ad
vantage, took the teamsters over the line
in double rjulcJt time and won a victory In
such rhort order that the spectators were
nonplused. ' '-'

BERKELEY, Oct. 8.â After the most ex
citing and stubborn freshmen contest of
the season the California freshmen de
feated the Santa Clara College team at
football this afternoon on the Berkeley
campus by a score of 5 to 0. In' the first
half the elevens wrestled up and down
the center of the field for twenty minutes
neither side getting dangerously near the
goal lines. In the second half the time
had nearly expired when the freshmen
worked the ball to within three yards of
the Santa Clara line. There Santa Clara
held it and the situation became so
critical that the freshmen decided to try
for a field goal. Quarterback Sell passed
the 'ball from Haffee, the center, to Right
Halfback Kern without a hitch, and Kern
sent the ball flying squarely between tne
two posts, making the score 5 to 0.
Feeling sure of the game, the coaches
then replaced almost the entire freshmen
team with new men, who were
not effective In holding and buck-
Ing the Santa Clara eleven. The
result '-was the Santa Claras beat
the freshmen back to the twenty
five yard line In a few minutes. Santa
Clara then attempted to repeat the fresh
men trick of klcklhg a field goal. Blow,
the Santa Clara right guard, sent the bali
flying toward the very center between the
goal posts, but It didn't go high enough,
and, striking the crossbar, bounded back
into Trie field. In the first half the teams
Â¦were made up of:

sloppy and the weather rainy, good rac
iÂ«g was seen to-day, the finishes in the
Ramapo handicap, won by River Pirate,
and in the fifth race, also a handicap, won
by Colonsay, beingr very keen and close.
On Bflmont^s River Pirate the work of
Hicks was very good, while not so much
could be said pf Bullman. who had the
mount on Injunction. Injunction was in
a. pocket on the beginning- of the far turn
and his backers saw Bullman was in too
much of a mix-up to come through. He
took up his, colt and made his run on the
outside. Injunction going: clear to the out
er rail. River Pirate came down the in
cline about fifteen feet away from. Injunc
tion. Beth Jockeys rode with great en
ergy and the result of the close finish
was in favor of River Pirate. His owner,
Perry Bclmont. was present to see the
colt'e victory. The Ramapo handicap was
â¢worth $2240 to the winner. Summary:

raw and chilly, the track was heavy, be
ing- fully ten seconds slow, and the card
of the ordinary variety. The slx-furlong
sprint was won by Big Ben, principally
through ; the clever riding of Dominlck.
The colt was quitting fifty yards from the
wire, but Dominick kept at him and fair
ly lifted him under the wire first by a
nock. Incidentally S. W. Street made a
"killing" on the victory of Big Ben. The
colt opened at 5 to 2 and under a heavy
and steady play was pounded down to
8 to a at post time, equal favorite with
Gypzene, which also was backed strong

The corporal's guard that turned out at
Recreation Park yesterday afternoon saw
the same old baseball stunt over again.
The Angels won. score 12 to 3. There waa
not a bit of interest In the game, and
after the first few innings nad been
played the fans began to make a get
away, until at the end of the- contest
the place was deserted.
Whalen could not pitch a lick at all.
The southern giants hit everything Jimmy
sent over the rubber. The fielders erred
whenever any of the Los Angeles play
ers were on the bags, so the score was
big before the game had grown many
innings old. The Angels did not exert
themselves to any serious extent, elso
they could have scored twice as many
runs.
Charley Baum pitched winning ball for
Morley. IIÂ© was steady in every Inning.
The three runs scored off his delivery
could have been prevented with a square
deal from the umpire and good support
from his fielders. He had speed and
curves, and worried the home batters la
every inning but one. The score:

tion of Ed E. Farley, the Chicago horse
man, on the charge of "ringing" the

been secured that could go three-quarters
of a mile in 1:13% and that she looked
like Sarah Black; that Sarah Black had
been put out of the way, and that thia
mare could be entered as Sarah Black at
the Roby track and a big killing be made
at the expense of the bookmakers.
The second letter, written from Little
Rock, stated that the mare was sick with
fever and that It would be Impossible to
ship her for some time. Both letters con
tained Injunctions to the receiver to be
sure to destroy them.

CHEER THEIR ALMA MATER
AT ANNUAL GATHERING
In that article It is stated that Mrs.
Knauer. who â¢ was at that time Maria
Herkner, had eloped with an undertaker
named Louis Schukiiecht, who left a wife
and two children behind him.
In the same article Charles J. Frank, a
prominent German of the Twenty-first
AVard, is alleged 4 to have stated that Mrs.
Herkner or Maria Rathke, which is said
to be her. right name, had eloped from
Germany a few years ago with Herkner,
who was at that time a lieutenant In the
German army, and eleven years her
junior.
While In Chicago Herkner ran away
with a woman named Peacock. Mrs.
Herkner chased the pair to New Tork,
but lost all trace of. them there. While
in that city she is reported to have fallen
Into tho good graces of Captain Liebe of
the Hamburg line. Â¦
Later on, after she had returned to
Chicago, she is reported to have had an
escapade at a North Side riding academy,
where she is said to have used a horse
whip on several prominent Germans. I
A pleasing Incident Is related of a little
episode which occurred at an initiation
Into the Order of Mutual Protection, the
"Vorwaerts Lodge No. 137," where. In' the
course of the i meeting, Mrs. Herkner, in
a fit of Jealousy, threw a cuspidor at the
head of one of the women present.
Many other interesting anecdotes of a
similar nature are also quoted in the arti
cle from the Chicago paper.
A WOMAN WITH A PAST.
The past career of the woman was pub
lished fully In a recent issue of the, Chi
pago Inter Ocean. If the allegations are
true she is placed In an unenviable light.
FISH COMMISSIONERS
SHOW GREAT' ACTIVITY
.When the case Is brought Into court the
proceedings are certain to be of a more
or less sensational character.. ; .
Meantime the representatives of the
foreign heirs are scurrying here and there
trying to locate the woman who won the
old man's affections and incidentally his
money by her devout and assiduous at
tentions during the last three months of
his life. She was devotion Itself. Every
wish was anticipated and every whim was
catered to and the day he went on to the
operating table he made his final will,
cutting off all his blood relations and
leaving everything to the woman who had
been his wife barely two months.
By the will his entire fortune of some
thing more than $60,000 was left to her
and she was appointed sole executrix.
The estate was practically all personal
property. Attorney Pohll states that a
good portion was invested in San Fran
cisco and that about $30,000 was in fine
securities in the south. He also states
that the widow has collected in some
thing like $16,000 from the estate, which
amount she has in her possession now.
How much more of the collaterals she
has converted into cash he was unable
to say.
HEIRS HUNT WOMAN.
Attorney August Muenter, who repre
sents Mrs. Knauer, stated that he was
not sure where his client was.
Dr. Emil Steltzner of 1234 Geary street,
who was one of the attending physicians
during Knauer's illness, stated that Mrs.
Knauer was somewhere across the bay,
but that she was too 111 to be seen.
Attorneys Loewy and Gutsch and Emil
Pohll, who represented the interests of
the German contestants, have been en
deavoring for. two days to serve a cita
tion upon the defendant, but they have
failed to do eo because she cannot be
found. At her residence in Elmhurst word
was given put that Mrs. Knauer had
gone to San Francisco. This advice was
given by a young woman who stated she
was Mrs. Knauer's niece.
p 1 1 HE threatened exposure of the
|| methods alleged to have been used
I by Mrs. Marie Knauer to captl-
vate her ancient spouse, Ferdinand
Knauer, have temporarily received
a setback.
Work of building the new edifice will
now begin. It Is to be constructed of

tors for the brick, stone, iron, carpenter
and plumbing work on the structure.

OTHER TIES SEVERED.
She said that her husband was a
prominent club man of Boston. She mar
ried him In 1877. and bore him two chil
dren, one a daughter, who recently died,
and the other a son, now residing In New
York. She said it was in 1879 that her
husband first displayed his brutality. In
that year he gagged her with her pocket
handkerchief because she called upon
him to stop abusing their infant daugh
ter. From that time on, she said, he
abused her in various ways, even threat
ening to kill her and himself. She said
that though he Is a man of means he be
grudged her every cent and often^toM her
to go out and cam a living for herself.
She said he frequently answered her ap
peals for money by telling her that he
needed all he had for himself and other
women and that as he did not care for
her any more he did not see why he
Fhould have to support her. Every Fri
day afternoon, in the eighteen months
preceding the time she left him in October.
1901, said Mrs. Betteley, her husband left
her and did not return until Monday. In
response to her inquiries as to where he
had been he would tell her that it was
none of her business. She also testified
that he was very uncouth and used lan
guage in public that would humiliate her
and cause her great mental suffering.
She also said that he had a reputation as
a raconteur and would frequently relate
stories In her presence that would mor
tify her. As to his conduct at the hotel
kept by Colson, she said it was unbeara
ble and the source of public comment.
This part of her tale was corroborated
by Colson. as was also her testimony, to
the effect that Betteley would use foul
language toward Jier during the progress
of games of whist which were the com
mon amusements of the guests of the ho
teL
BETTELEY A CLTJB MAN.
When Mrs. Betteley appeared in Judge
Seawell's court yesterday she was attired
in black. Her tale of matrimonial unhap
piness was soon told, without any appear
ance of feeling except when the Judge
asked her why she remained with her
husband if he treated her so cruelly.
Then her voice broke and she sobbingly
answered, "Because I loved my children
and did not want anything like this to
happen until they were old enough to
care for themselves."
It appears from the testimony in both
cases that Colson was a hotel-keeper in
Boston. Mr. and Mrs. Betteley were his
guests. He was in consequence In a po
sition to know of Betteley's treatment of
h!s wife. And, of course, Mrs. Betteley
could notice how Mr. and Mrs. Colson
agreed and disagreed. That' neither miss
ed an opportunity was made evident dur
ing the trial of both suits, for Mrs. Bet
teley testified that she had frequently to
leave a whist game because of the con
duct of her husband, and Colson testified
that on many an occasion he gave up a
good hand because of his wife's interfer
ence.
WERE GUESTS OF COLSON.
Colson's suit was heard by Judge Mu
rasky a week ago last Saturday, and he
was given an interlocutory decree of di
vorce. Mrs. Betteley's 'suit was heard
yesterday bv Judge Seawell. She was
awarded an interlocutory decree. Now
the mere fact of two Boston people get
ting a divorce is not strange in San Fran
cisco. People from various parts of the
United States come here for release from
uncongenial mates and get it. But it
seldom happens that divorces are granted
under the condition3 that existed in the
Betteley suit and the suit of Colson. For
Mrs. Betteley furnished the necessary
corroborative evidence in the Colson suit,
and yesterday when Judge Seawell asked
for further testimony on. behalf of Mrs.
Betteley, Henri' Wyman Page Colson
took the witness stand and furnished the
testimony necessary to brand Betteley as
a cruel spouse.
COLSON GETS DIVORCE.
In staid old Boston there lived Henry
Wyman Page Coleon and his wife Louisa.
The hub of the universe was also the
abiding place of Albert C. Betteley and
his wife Georgina. Neither the Colsons
nor the Betteleys were happy, though
both couples possessed sufficient of this
world's goods to enable them to live at
expensive hotels. So Betteley's wife came
to this city and visited the office of At
torney Carleton W. Greene and retained
him as her attorney in her divorce pro
ceedings. Then Colson forsook the hub
and wended his way westward in search
of freedom from his irksome matrimonial
bonds. Strange to relate, he also retained
Attorney Greene, and that gentleman
drew up a complaint in which he charged
Mrs. Colson with being" cruel to her hus
band. He had previously .drawn up a
document in which he stamped Betteley
as a brutal spouse. And strangely, too,
in both complaints the game of whist
played an important part, though In the
relation of Colson's troubles Greene made
his client a physical* wreck mainly be
cause of Mrs. Colson's fondness for aged
and decrepit cats.

turned out to witness the third game,

rather uncomfortable for the spectators.

the . players, as some very fast fielding
was done by both teams. Leever and

The i closing meetings Â¦'Â¦ of the , twenty
third annual session of the San*Francisco
Baptist Association were held Jn the
First Baptist Church of .San^ Francisco
yesterday afternoon and last evening. ,
i The convention has been held in cele
bration of the twenty-third anniversary
of the'society's organization, and the va
rious meetings for the last three days
have been well attended. .The addresses
have all been made by the foremost mem
bers of the Baptist church, many of
whom have come from the different large
cities of the State to participate In the
exercises. .
.The body of land In question is a well
known deposit of anthracite coal. It was
exploited by an English company and is
considered to be one of the largest de
posits on the continent- Kinley & KinJey
are attorneys for the plaintiff.
About six months ago. when the de
fendants went down to Mexico and took
possession of the premises, there was a
title dispute, and some holders, it Is
claimed, got some Taqui Indians to make
a raid upon the adverse claimants, which
was done, and, several miners were killed.
The purpose of this suit Is to establish
the liability of the directors personally by
reason of the alleged fraudulent transac
tion; and it is further alleged in the com
plaint that the ultimate epd of the de
fendants is to oust the present bondhold
ers and repurchase from this Mexican
company at a lower figure.
There are about $700,000 worth of bonds
outstanding held by Senor Garcia, Gov
ernor of Sonora. and others and this suit
is prosecuted on behalf of. these bond
holders.
It is alleged that the defendants, with
a fraudulent design to defeat the value
of these bonds and defraud the bondhold
ers, forfeited this coal estate by reason
of the non-compliance with their contract
of purchase and as a result the bonds be
came valueless.
The transaction aa stated In the com
plaint grows out of the sale of the Com
panla Exploradora" de Terrenos Car
boniferos en Sonora, a Mexican company,
owning 2,496,600 acres of coal land in the
state 'of Sonora, Mexico, through a pro
moter, C. P. Eagan, to the defendants,
who formed a corporation known as the
Mexican Anthracite Coal Mining Com
pany, and thereupon the latter company
capitalized itself at $1,500,000 and issued
first mortgage bonds upon the property,
setting out that it was the owner of all
this coal property and floated bonds on
the market. Among others who came
into possession of the bonds was George
Jackson, the plaintiff, who owned to the
extent of $70,000. ,
A suit was filed yesterday In the United
States Circuit Court for the Northern
District of California by George W.
Jackson against Alvinza Hayward, H. G.
Stevenson, J. D. Arnold, A. J. Ulman and
Charles D. Lane, as directors of the Mex
ican Anthracite Coal Mining Company,
and in their Individual capacities, and
the Mexican Anthracite Coal Mining
Company and the Mercantile Trust Com
pany of this city.

G. N. aicLAREN of the
//^ British Efclp "Wcmyss Bay. which
IV^ was wrecked September 16 at
ilazatlan, arrived here yesterday,
a passenger oa the Pacific Mail
Company's steamer San Jose. The crew
returned on a previous steamship. Before
Captain McLaren left Mazatlan the
"Wemyss Bay had completely disappeared.
After the crew left her, she broke her
Lack on the rocky beach and a few days
later was swallowed in the quicksands of
Mazatlan harbor.
Captain McLaren â¢witnessed the de
struction, at Mazatlan, on September 26,
of the Danish bark Clara with all hands. I
The Clara, like the Wemyss Bay, was
resting at anchor when a terrific hurri
cane swept in from the Bea. Gradually
the gallant bark was driven toward tha
recks, and when darkness fell was al- 1
ir.ost within striking distance. The last
Ecene of the tragedy was hidden from the.
watches ashore by the curtain of night.
When day dawned the bark had disap
peared. The harbor waters were covered
with wreckage and the beach strewa
Â¦with the bodies of the men whose floating
home had been shattered in the conflict
Among those that died when the Clara
Â¦went to pieces was a Mexican custom
house inspector, who had gone aboard in
the line of his regular duty. When the
gale assumed threatening aspects, but
while a boat could still live in the waters
of the harbor, the Inspector's wife paid
a boatman $100 to row to the Clara and
her husband ashore. The harbor
master ordered the boat back, saying that
the inspector's watch would not be over
until 6 o'clock, and until that hour he
must remain on guard. By 6 o'clock the
Clara was being swept shorewards by a
howling hurricane and the sending of
help was beyor.d human possibility.
Captain McLaren declares the hurricane
to have been one of the fiercest he has
6een in a long- life on the waters. At
the time the Clara was destroyed the
steamship Limar.tour was driven on the
rocks, but was subsequently floated. The
press dispatches placed the loss of life
at twenty-five, but acording to Captain
McLaren only sixteen lives were lost
when the Clara went down.
May Award Contract To-Morrow.
Mayor Schmltz yesterday attended the special
meeting called by the Harbor Commissioners
for the consideration of bids for the construc
tion of 600 feet of new seawall. The Atlantic,
Gulf and Pacific Company's bid of $110,100 was
the lowest and to that concern probably will
be awarded the contract Engineer Norton's
estimate of the expense of the work was about
$10,000 lower than the lowest bid, and it is
possible that all bids may be rejected. Against
this John McMullen. representing the lowest
bidder, made a vigorous protest, affirming that
the bid of his company, and, in his opinion,
all the other bids had been made on a strictly
business basis and without collusion. The
Mayor wa3 not prepared yesterday to give his
consent to the awarding of the contract, but
promised to attend a meeting at 1 o'clock to
morrow prepared to act either one Â¦Â»&>* or the
other.
San Jose Arrives.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamship San
Jose. Captain G. W. Brown, arrived yesterday
from Panama and way ports. She brought
twenty-six passengers. 032 tons of cargo and
treasure valued at $18,012. Her passengers In
cluded the following named: ,

Gifford Is Still on Beach.
Nothing was done yesterday toward the float
ing of the stranded British bark Gifford on
account of the heavy surf. The rate of re
insurance was advanced to 00 per cent and,
although Captain Alexander Woodslde and
Captain Metcalfe still express hopes of saving
the vessel,' the general opinion of the local
chipping world seems to be that the GIfford
will never leave the beach except in pieces.
Up to the present however, the vessel aRpears
to be In good condition and fine weather might
yet enable the salvers to get her off.
Beinsurance' Advances.
The rate of reinsurance on the Flnsbury was
advanced yesterday to S5 per cent, the Corolla

With reference to the reported state
ment of police officials, that he
has no right to inquire into mat
ters leading up to the suicide of the
decedent, the Coroner said that It was
necessary that the Jury should know and
state In their verdict whether or not the
decedent was Insane at the time he took
his life, or driven to- the verge of insanity
because the policeman had accused him
of being a degenerate.
Dr. Iceland explained further that he
thought he had been doing the police
department a favor by affording to one
of its members the opportunity of vindi
cating-himself from the inference that
he was responsible for the suicide of the
Consular attache.
In reply to a report that ' Policeman
John Kramer, who arrested Colonel. Tom
Kim Yung of I the Chinese Consulate
on September 14, would ; refuse to be
at the Inquest to-day, Coroner Le
land said yesterday that subpenas
would be served on Kramer and
other police witnesses to appear and
testify, and*, that In the 'event that they
should neglect or refuse to put In an ap
pearance he would apply to the Superior
Court to have them punished for con
tempt. He added that he had continued
the Inquest until to-day for the purpose of
affording an opportunity to Policeman
Kramer to introduce evidouce to deny
that offered by -the Chinese witnesses,
who had ' testified that Kramer \ had com
mitted an unwarranted assault upon Col
onel Tom and had. then knocked him
down with a blow in the faoe. V> : â¢
Some years . ago . Coroner Hawkins im
prisoned a doctor for contempt' for having
refused to answer several questions under
oath at an inquest. Upon an appeal the
State Supreme Court decided that the
Coroner had no power to punish for con
tempt, and that the proper procedure in
such a case was for the Coroner to cer
tify the facts to the Superior Court,
which could then inflict j the punishment
upon tho recalcitrant witness.

and Muscat, which were in very small supply,
cleaned up quickly at 85c@$l pet box. Receipts
of Wine Grapes were less liberal than on the
preceding day, bu* carried-over stock of poor 1
quality was abundant, and the market ruled 1
weak, with the demand slack. The demand
for fancy Apples was less urgent than during ,
the early Dart of the week, as all orders for I
shipment were filled. Prices, however, were
unchanged. Stocks of Peaches were very light
and they were firm at advanced prices. The
oth"r orchard fruits were in ample supply ]
and met with a fair demand at unchanged I
rates. Melons were In free supply and very I
dull, with several dealers offering large lines

fect sales. The usual quantity of Berries was

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. 8.â Active, buying of De
rÂ»mber wheat by commission houses and brok
ers caused a strong tone in that grain and an
a result of this urgent demand the near by
delivery rose to thÂ» level of the May option.
Â¦ Opening prices were firm on steady cables,
December being unchanged to He higher at
i 77%@77Aie to 77*4@77 T^c. There was a dis
position on the part of the general trade to
regard thÂ« early strength as a joke, and scalp
ers Â»old on the Advance In expectation of a
reaction. But the firmness did not yield and
the character of tJie buying seemed to indicate
support from one of the most prominent bullfe.
As a result shorts covered freely and the mar
ket advanced with the session. The big ad
vances at St. Louis and Minneapolis, together
with the small primary receipts and the larg*
premiums offered for the cash article werÂ«
bull factors later in the day. and prices con
tinued strong up to 1 the close. December

THE beautiful series of art reproductions,
in color, now being given free as a sup-
_J plement to The Sunday Call, will be
materially enhanced in value by the addition of
the magnificent picture to be distributed next
Sunday.
This beautiful picture is the work of the
eminent German artist, Adolph Schreyer, and
is called "The Arab Scout."
1^ v^ Â£**Â£*< Â¦ - -^'â¢% > "*.\' JBBBra!jow^H| ' -- '^' ' j
TJ1E ARAB SCOUT.
This title, whfch has been given to many of the pictures of Al-
gerian horsemen painted by Adolph Schreyer, was never better ap-
plied than to the Â»>ne which furnishes the subject of The Call Art
Supplement. , â¢
The alejt and Â«autioys Attitude of the rider and the careful man-
ner in which the horse is shown picking hi3 way through a trackless
waste suggest forcibly that they are on uncertain cround. where tm- '
seen foes may be met at any moment . .
Schreyer was a romanticist. He seemed to resrard the horse with
much the same love and respect that the Arabs bestow upon what they
consider God's most precious gift to man.
He also surrounded the Arab with a glamour of romance. The
free adventuse of their nomadic lives, their skill in horsemanship and
the use of firearms, the wealth of color and ornament in their cos-
tumes and trappings for their steeds are dwelt upon in his pictures
with a fond attention which indicates an absorbing interest in them.
Few painters have adhered to a class of subjects â one mi^ht say
a single subjectâ as closely as Schreyerv*
In his earlv life he painted some scenes in which Wallachian team-
sters or field artillery of various armies played a prominent part, but
when he had once become familiar with Arabs and their hor3.es he
rarely attempted to paint other subjects. â¢ -'}'Â¦?>
Adolph Schrever was born in Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1828. He
studied drawinc in the Stadel Institute in that city and studied horses
in a riding school. Later he pursued his a,rt studies in Stutteart.
Munich and Dusseldorf. -Â¦ ,
In 1848 he traveled throueh Hungary, Wallachia and the land of
the Cossacks with the Prirtce of Thttrn and Taxis.
He accompanied the Austrian army on its march . throusrh the
Danubian provinces in 18^4. and in 1856 traveled through Syria and
Egyot. ' ' â¢
In 1861 he visited Algiers, and from that year until 1870 he re-
sided in Paris. In that vear he went to Kronbere. near Frankfort.'
and until his death he divided his time between that place and Paris.
' He received honors in many Earo'pean exhibitions and is repre-
sented in many public galleries. He was a member of the Academies
of "Antwerp' and Rotterdam: was court painter to the Grand Duke of
Mecklenburg: was chevalier of the Order of Leopold.
In America his wqrk has been immensely popular. Scarcely a
public or private collection of any importance is without" one or sev-
eral of his paintings.
The Vanderbilt. Catherine Wolf, William Astor. August Belmont.
Stebbins. Drexel. Walters. Morgan. Huntington. Butler and Rocke-
feller collections are a few in which he was, or is, represented by'im-
portant works. : â¢
Thei Chicago Art Institute possesses a most admirable example in
"Horses Fleeing from a Burning Stable," in the Munger collection
and Call readers will soon have this beautiful picture free as usual. ' [

Miles T. Baird, scion of the wealthy
family of that name, who has-been be
fore " the public on more than one occa
sion, having figured in several sensational
escapades -with; a notorious woman, on
whom he lavished his affections and a
large part of his money, started out last
evening with the evident intention of
emulating t^e deeds ; of Dead wood Dick,
the Black Hills sharpshooter, and wound
up in the City Prison on charges of dis
charging firearms in the city : limits : and
carrying a concealed weapon. Â¦ â¢ . ; v-
A time ago , Miles Baird : sprang
suddenly into notoriety by recelvlpg a
knife thrust at â¢ the harids of the woman
from whom he â¢ had rescued his younger
brother and In turn had fallen, "a victim
to her; wiles. Â¦ ,; . .
Last night about 8 o'clock Miles Baird
was standing at the cigar- store In front
of the Russ House bar : on Montgomery
street somewhat under the influence' of
liquor. According to his own story, Wal
ter Bchlesslnger, ;the ; clerk at the cigar
store, jestingly made some remark to the
effect" that he. did' not know how to use
A revolver, and "Just for; fun", he, banged
away at the swinging doors of the saloon
as tan- illustration of his markmanshlp.
The bullet passed through the mahogany
doors,' and , it is Â¦ regarded* as miraculous
that no one was - hit , Patrolman Groat
arrived and placed Baird under arrest. A
search ; of ; the : saloon : failed to bring to
light the bullet, and it undoubtedly lodged
somewhere in the woodwork.
Baird when booked at ithe City Prison
gave the name of George McColl. He was
thoroughly repentant and gave evidence
of having Indulged ; too freely In liquor.
Up'to a late hour last, night he had not
been admitted to ball. When searched a
32-calIber revolver was found in his pos
session. \
Tee Get Tong, lnterpreter^tor the law
firm of Barnes & McCloskey arid the Chi
nese Freemasons and erstwhile convict,
was riddled /with bullets while at supper
in his room in the " headquarters of the
Hop Sing' Tong, Â¦'? 826% ". Clay street, last
evening -shortly, before 6 o'clock.
j The discovery of ' the crime" was made
by; Ah Gee, a Chinaman residing in-;the
house,. who was on his way to his room
and in passing the open door of the apart
ment occupied by Yee., was horrified to see
histbody lying on "the bed with the blood
flowing . from; a gaping wound in the
head. "He Immediately ran to the street
ana notified Special Watchman Henry
Dpffleld.fDetective McMahon and Corpor
al" Sylvester. Â¦
The officers repaired to" the- room and
upon' making an investigation discovered
that Yee had been" shot, while seated at^
table partaking of his evening meal. Tne
murderer had undoubtedly crept up to his
victim through the open door and, placing
the -weapon < within two inches of Yee's
head, ) pulled the trigger anfl sent" a bul
let crashing into his brain. ? The bullet en
tered; the right side of the head, directly
In front;of' theear, and the face â¢is," con
siderably powder marked. . Two other bul
lets ;/were fired into 'the victim's, body. ,
;; Yee fell between two beds in the room,
with his head toward the wall. ". His mur
derer, wishing to make certain of his
prey,, fired .three" more -shots, ânone, of
.which, took effect, the bullets i lodging. in
the wall. ; '. . '"I" ; ;
The officers ascertained that i the blood
thirsty'highbinder had made his. escape
through ; a trapdoor i opening on >Â¦ the roof

to the bride, the nuptials were to be kept
a secret for at least six months, at â¢ the

SHOWS EFFECTIVE PICTURES
OF THE GREAT SOUTHWEST
Monson is soon to leave for the East,
where he will deliver lectures and show
his valuable collections of Illustrations of
the grand scenery. He will later visit
London with the same object.
These pictures were thrown upon a
screen and It was admitted by the largo
and representative audience that more
beautiful illustrations of nature have
never been seen hero. They are colored
to represent nature as found in the
Southwest. Among ihe pictures were
glorious night and early morning effects,
and representations of the homes of the
Navajos and also the habitations of a
vanished race. Dangerous trails and
canyon walls of wondrous height, and
more wondrous form, were shown and
were received with enthusiastic applause,
while pictures of great waterfalls created
astonishment for their excellence.
Frederick Monson delivered a lecture
at the Press Club on Wednesday night
which will be remembered for ite elabor
ate and graphic description, of the great
Southwest- Monson has Just returned
from an extensive trip and has brought
with him a large u>!liv;t;on of pictures
and relics from the cliff dwellings of the

The Olympic saloon, conducted by
Thomas Havey at 519 Pacific street, was
the scene of a daring hold-up last evening
and only the alertness and sprinting abili
ty of Patrolman Richard Skaln prevented
the criminal from making his escape.
."Â¦> W. H. Eggleston. a mining man residing
at the New Western Hotel, was the vic
tim of the intrepid crook, and he lost a
valuable gold watch and a nugget chain.
Eggleston sauntered Into the saloon, and,
lifter having a drink, was accosted by
Morris Becker, the man in custody.
Becker was very friendly and had several
drinks with his new acquaintance. After
being in the saloon for about an hour Eg
gleston retired to the lavatory and was
followed by Becker, who suddenly drew
an ugly looking revolver and ordered him
to throw up his. bands.
Eggleston Immediately compiled and
was relieved of his watch and chain. The
robber than ran out of the saloon and up
Pacific street. Patrolman Skaln was at
tracted by the blowing of a police whistle
and started In pursuit. The fleeing crook
increased his pace and ran down Kearny
street,. turning into Jackson, in the direc
tion of Dupont. When near Bartlett alley
he was overhauled by Officer Skaln and
members of the Chinatown squad. He re
sisted arrest, Â¦ but was overpowered and
lodged in the City Prison on a robbery
charge.
1 Eggleston identified his assailant and
the evidence Is sufficient to send him
across the bay for. a term of years. Becker

one 'year ago, after serving a sentence of

is believed that the stand he took In the

the causes that led up, to his death.

THE newspapers of the Interior,
Including the Democratic jour
nals, are laughing at the Exam
iner's attitude in this campaign.
The Red Bluff News, comment
ing on the situation, remarks:
The fact is the Examiner is between the
devil and the deep sea. The Examiner's boss
is a candidate for President. He wants the
nomination from the Democrats and therefore
his paper must be Democratic. He wants the
nomination from the labor unions and there
fore his paper must be labor union. The
Democrats have a candidate for Mayor in the
person of Franklin K. Lane, and the labor
unions have a candidate In the person of Eu
gene E. Echmitz. If the Examiner should
support Lane -and oppose Schmitz It w6uld of
fend the Labor Union party and If it should
support Schmitz and oppose Lane It would
offend the Democrats. So "here is a dilemma.
What is the poor devil to do?
HUSBAND EVADES
HIS YOUNG WIFE
the enemy of labor, is now supported In
a half-hearted manner. Poor Schmitz,
almost daft with grief, is turning to Ruef
and Parry and the colt for consolation.
He is explaining to his bunch of sympa
thizers in each district that he went to
New York hot to help a Democratic
nominee for Congress, but to help' a
friend of labor. Now that friend of labor
is embracing Gavin McNab and Franklin
K. Lane, who were recently assailed "as
foes of organized labor. Schmitz, in his
distress last night, said he was glad the
newspapers were against him. In the
light of his experience with the Demo
cratic press he has a right to entertain
that feeling. In the Democratic camp all
is confusion. 'Lane talked the nominee for
Tax Collector off the ticket last "Wednes
day night, so there are now three vacan
cies for- McNab to fill.
CHINESE KILLED
WHILE AT TABLE
This is what It is trying to do. It- is try
ing to "carry water on both shoulders." It
will make a pretense perhaps of supporting
Lane, but It will be very careful to say noth
ing offensive to or about Schmitz. and. if
possible, its language will be so guarded that,
while pretending to support Lane to satisfy
the Democrats, It can claim to the Labor
Unionists that It Is really supporting Schmitz.
Did you notice the splendid lift it gave
Schmitz in the lengthy and full account of
his ratification meeting?
The Examiner is trying a dangerous ex
periment tand if it Is not extremely shrewd
and very careful it ' will "fall between ; two
stools." The policy it has marked out j for
Itself will be satisfactory to neither party.
The fact that the Examiner is now
dancing to the music of Gavin McNab's
political orchestra affords infinite del.'ght
to the regulars of the old Democratic ma
chine. McNab has waited lgng for the
opportunity to make the Examiner waltz.

Voters of the Fortieth District Turn
Out to Hear Him Speak.
Mayor Schmitz addressed the voters of
the Fortieth Assembly District In Frank
lin Hall last night. He was given a
hearty welcome and epoke on issues of
the campaign. The hall was well filled
with voters of the district. During the
meeting about 100 members of the' News
boys' Union marched into the hall yell
ing for the Union Labor party's standard
bearer for Mayor. In the course of his
address the Mayor said:
We have no Gavin McNab behind us; we
hav? no newspapers behind us; we must go
before the people and be careful how we make
our fight. I say here to-night, with all earn
estness, r would' rather not have the news
papers behind me to long as I have the hearts
of the, people of Gan Francisco. (Applause.)
Now, I have only my record to euind on,
and I ask the people for their support. I am
egotistical enough *to believe that that record
lÂ» good enough to warrant the people of San
Francisco in having faith enough in me to
give me . a second term, to see what better
government I can give them, to see how I can
carry out the different things I have mapped
out for the city, which no man lovea better
than I, because it is the city of my birth.
When I took office I took It with a handi
cap. I did not have Supervisors to back me
up on any proposition I might bring forth
for the public good. When in the Interest of
the budget I clearly proved to the Super
visors that they could save over $140,000 and
put it to the improvement of streets, flffen
of those men stood against me, and I am sorry
to say that two of tne men, whom we elected
to office, did not stand by their party pledges,
and I was voted down â my veto was not sus
tained.
And ao it has been all along: the line. I
have been unable to do the good I desired.
Shortly after my Induction Into office I round
that for a long period the Justices' clerk was
attending the races, with hi9 deputies. I
found on Investigation one man was doing the
work, while five were being paid by the peo
ple. I placed Mr. Fredrick in office. He
was not allowed to remain long. Probably
he was too honest for those who surrounded
him. I can see no other reason, for he made
a capable officer.
One of my opponent* put forth the other
e-venlnir reasons why he ought to be elected.
He said the city of San Francisco needed to
be saved. From what, I don't know. (Laugh
ter.) He also said the charter needed to be
saved/, and he also raid he deserved election
because he had a child born here, although he
was not a native himself, he being a native
of Canada.- (Laughter.) I can go him two
better than that, because I have three born
In San Francisco. (Acplause.) That Is not a
qualification for office, gentlemen, but the
qualifications are these: Will the man you
place In office deal honestly and fairly? "Will
the man you place in office remember that he
is at the service of the people, placed there
by the people, and that the office does not
belong to him to run as he sees fit?
Speeches. were also made by J. J. Con
ley, candidate for Public Administrator;
Powel Fredrick, candidate for County
Clerk, and half a dozen other candidates.
An organization called the Schmitz Cen
tral Club was formed at 8 Ellis street
last night. E. C. Leffingwell was elected
temporary chairman.

BT a vote eo decisive as to pre
clude the possibility cf an acci
dent or a misunderstanding San
Francisco determined yesterday
that the municipality should not
engage in the street railway
business. The proposed issue of bonds for
the purpose of taking over the Geary
6treet railway and placing it oa a basis
to be operated by the city was defeated.
The supporters of the proposed bond Issue
failed to secure the requisite two-thirds
majority by 2357 votes out of a total of
25,259. There were cast In favor of the
preposition 14.4S1 votes and against it 10,
745 votes.
The election was entirely without inci
dent, unless the unexpectedly heavy vote
cast on the question south of Market
Etreet may be regarded as such. The vot
ing was slow but steady. At noon it did
not seem as if more than 20 per cent of
the registered vote would be polled. All
through the afternoon there ensued a
steady "plunking." however, eo that
when the baliots were counted nearly one
third of the registered vote was found to
have been cast.
There did not appear to bo any effort
made by either the exponents of the bond
Issue or its opponents to secure votes. AJ1
of the rushing around and the endeavors
to roust out recalcitrant and indifferent
electors that are conspicuous at ether
elections were entirely lacking yesterday.
The polling booths were deserted for the
most part except for the election officials.
In the early morning hours there was
something of a jam around the booths
south of Market street, where the wcrk
lngiaen were anxious to cast their ballots
before they went to their labors. This
was the only time that the election offi
cers were compelled to work fast.
An analysis of the vote shows that in
the residence districts the sentiment was
decidedly against the proposition of is
suing bonds for acquiring the Geary
etreet line. In the lodging-house dis
tricts south of Market street, notably in
the Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth and
Thirtieth Assembly districts, which com
prise that portion of the city from the
bay to .Thirteenth Etreet, a heavy vote
was cast in favor of issuing the bonds.
Farther west in the Mission the opposi
tion to the bonds grew steadily. Out that
Â¦way the workers own their little homes
and they evinced no desire to saddle the
city with a vast debt in a doubtful ex
periment. In the Potrero the sentiment
â¢was favorable to the bond issue, which Is
explained by the fact that few of the
voters there own property of any kind.
North of Market street. In the Rich
mond district and the Western Addition,
the voters would have none of the munic
ipal ownership as embodied in the Geary
street proposition. Even in the districts
contiguous to the line of the
"rcajiJ, a decided protest was en
tered by the voters against the
proposed experiment with the public
money. The light vote north of Market
ttreet showed a lack of Interest In the
election and the returns gave assurance
that any increase In the total vote would
undoubtedly have resulted In a more over
whelming defeat of the proposition. Out
cf all the districts north of Market street

chairman, held another session at general
headquarters, 16 Geary Etreet. yesterday
afternoon." Plans for district meetings were
discussed at length. The party organiza

b*s of the campaign committee are con
ilaent of Republican success^at the elec
tion on November 3, but this confidence
wl$l not cause a cessation of effort in aid
of the ticket. . Special exertions will be
made to bring to- the ?olls every regis
tered voter of Republican faith, in order
that a rousing and significant majority
for the whole ticket may be returned.
The most encouraging reports of party
unity and enthusiasm are received by
Wr J. Dutton. John S. Partridge. Arthur

otto of the campaign committee. Hon. A.
P. Williams, Dr. W. F. McNutt. Thomas
Westoby,; John C. Lynch, David Rich,
Thomas : D. Riordan, Henry Ach, Jacob
Steppacher and other active members of
the United Republican League share tne
confidence expressed by the members of
the campaign committee.
The energies and winning personality
of Henry J. Crocker count In favor of the
whole ticket. Â¦ In very many respects he
Is an Ideal candidate. There 'la nothing
haughty and aristocratic in his demeanor.
He is simply a plain, approachable busi
ness man, who has the ability and the in
clination to serve the people of the city
In which he dwells. When he addresses
an audience of his fellow workers in the
cause of San Francisco he does not put
on airs of condescension and point to
himself as the "great I am." He Is Just
the plain everyday business man and na
tive son, Henry Crocker. His friends, and
they- are legion,, know that he Is not a
professional politician or a chronic Job
chaser. To-morrow night at the ratifi
cation meeting he will speak frankly to
his fellow citizens. All taxpayers and
others Interested in the expansion of San
Francisco will be welcomed to the meet
ing-. George A. Knight, one of the sifted
orators of California, will probably en
liven the meeting by a plain statement; of
a few facts. The , Republican speakers
will not deal in Innuendo. That is not the
American style of campaigning, but cer
tain incidents of the contest may Justify
plain talk.
It was talk on the streets and at the
several political' headquarters that the
Democratic ratification meeting at the Al
hambra Theater Wednesday night was
quite successful so far as "Billy" Hynes
and the audience were concerned. The
audience wanted to hear Hynes' voice in
comic .song and insisted on the singing
with such demonstrations of desire that
Orator Hickey lost his temper and his

QUICKLY CAUGHT
presence of mind. Whi!Â© the peoplo on
the main floor and In the sallerles were
shouting for more of Hynes, the job-chas
ing representatives of McNab on the
stage were pushing Lane to the front.
After the desire for sons was repressed
and the dose of oratory administered to
the impatient audience, Mr. Hlnton. the
venerable candidate for Treasurer on the
Democratic ticket, came to the platform
through one of the wings. Mr. Hinton
attended a meeting at the Alhambra four
years ago and went out* while Lane was
talking of himself. Wednesday night
when he came In through the wings and
heard Lane still talking on the familiar
subject he fancied that it was the same
old speech not quite concluded.
Thomas "W. Hlckey. chairman of Gavin
McNab's recent convention, has laid down
the rule that Michael J. Hynes shall not
again in this campaign appear on the
same platform with Franklin K. Lane.
The. songs of "Billy" Hynes' repertory,
which the representative Democrats love
to hear and which the Horse and Cart
men prize far above the platitudes of
Lane, are quite comical. The laughing
song is great and the song about the fel
low who lost the train to Morrow is
surely amusing. The voice of "Billy"
Hynes may not especially qualify him for
the office of Public Administrator, but if
Lane can chase for an office on his record
as a talker. Hynes surely has the right
to run on his record as a singer.
